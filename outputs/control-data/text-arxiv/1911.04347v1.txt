Abstract. We consider the one-constant Landau - de Gennes model for nematic liquid crystals. The order
parameter is a traceless tensor field Q, which is constrained to be uniaxial: Q = s(n ⊗ n − d−1 I) where n is a
director field, s ∈ R is the degree of orientation, and d ≥ 2 is the dimension. Building on similarities with the
one-constant Ericksen energy, we propose a structure-preserving finite element method for the computation
of equilibrium configurations. We prove stability and consistency of the method without regularization,
and Γ-convergence of the discrete energies towards the continuous one as the mesh size goes to zero. We
design an alternating direction gradient flow algorithm for the solution of the discrete problems, and we
show that such a scheme decreases the energy monotonically. Finally, we illustrate the method’s capabilities
by presenting some numerical simulations in two and three dimensions including non-orientable line fields.

1. Introduction
The liquid crystal state of matter is observed in certain materials as a mesophase between the crystalline
and the isotropic liquid phases. Such a state may be obtained as a function of temperature between the
two latter phases; in this case, these are called thermotropic liquid crystals. Other classes include lyotropic
and metallotropic liquid crystals, in which concentration of the liquid-crystal molecules in a solvent or the
ratio between organic and inorganic molecules determine the phase transitions, respectively. In this paper,
we consider thermotropic liquid crystals [23].
The physical state of a material can be described in terms of the translational and rotational motion of its
constituent molecules. In a crystalline solid, molecules exhibit both long-range ordering of the positions of
the centers and orientation of the molecules. As the substance is heated, the molecules gain kinetic energy
and large molecular vibrations usually make these two ordering types disappear at the same temperature.
This results in a fluid phase. However, in some materials, that typically consist of either rod-like or disc-like
molecules, the long-range orientational ordering survives until a higher temperature than the long-range
positional ordering. Such a state of matter is called liquid crystalline. Moreover, when long-range positional
ordering is completely absent, the liquid crystal is regarded as nematic.
On average, nematic liquid crystal molecules are aligned with their long axes parallel to each other. At
the macroscopic level, this means that there is a preferred direction; often, such a direction is a rotational
symmetry axis. In such a case, the nematic liquid crystal phase is uniaxial. If, in contrast, there is no such
rotational symmetry, then the material is in a biaxial state.
Depending on the choice of order parameter (cf. Section 2.1), several models for nematic liquid crystals
have been proposed. Because the vast majority of thermotropic liquid crystals exhibit uniaxial behavior, this
is often built into the modeling. If one takes as order parameter the orientation of the molecules n(x) ∈ Sd−1 ,
for x ∈ Ω ⊂ Rd , then n is a harmonic mapping in the domain Ω; numerical methods for this model have
been proposed, for example, in [1, 3, 11, 19, 30, 41]. We refer also to [20, 33, 42, 62] for discretizations of
liquid crystal flows. It is often the case that liquid crystal configurations display defects, that is, that the
molecular orientation is not continuous in some regions of the material. Harmonic map models do not allow
for point defects if d = 2 or line defects if d = 3, because the energy is singular.
However, if besides the liquid crystal molecule orientation n one considers a scalar variable s(x) that
represents the degree of alignment that molecules have with respect to n, then the equilibrium configuration

minimizes the Ericksen energy [23, 24, 60]. Minimizers of such an energy can exhibit nontrivial defects, as the
parameter s can relax a large contribution from |∇n|, and wherever the degree of alignment s vanishes, the
resulting Euler-Lagrange equation for n is degenerate. Finite element methods for the Ericksen model have
been used to approximate both equilibrium configurations [45, 46, 47] and dynamics [10] of the molecular
orientation.
If one considers the probability distribution of the liquid crystal molecules orientation and chooses to use
its second moments to define an order parameter, then this leads to the Landau - de Gennes model. In such
a model, the order parameter is a tensor field Q(x) that measures the discrepancy between the probability
distribution at x ∈ Ω and a uniform distribution on Sd−1 . Numerical methods for the Landau - de Gennes
energy are considered in [6, 12, 22, 29, 35, 52].
In this work, we shall be concerned with uniaxial nematic liquid crystals in Rd for d ≥ 2; we present
numerical experiments for d = 2, 3. Our goal is to design a finite element method for a uniaxially-constrained
Q-tensor model, and to prove stability and convergence properties. More precisely, we prove that if the
corresponding meshes are weakly acute, then our discrete energy Γ-converges to the continuous one as the
mesh size goes to zero. Our method can handle the degeneracy introduced by a vanishing degree of orientation
without any regularization. Moreover, because the Q-tensor approach incorporates a head-to-tail symmetry
into the modeling, our approach is able to capture non-orientable equilibrium configurations.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss modeling of the equilibrium states of liquid
crystals. We examine the Landau - de Gennes and Ericksen energies, and discuss the capabilities of these
models to capture defects. Section 3 is devoted to the formulation of the problem we study in this paper.
Such a section includes a discussion on previous work for the Ericksen model [46], which is instrumental for
our numerical method. We introduce the discrete setting for the uniaxially-constrained Landau - de Gennes
energy and prove key energy inequalities in Section 4. Afterwards, in Section 5, we prove the Γ-convergence
of the discrete energies. For the computation of discrete minimizers, in Section 6 we propose a gradient flow
and prove a strictly monotone energy decreasing property. Finally, Section 7 presents numerical experiments
for d = 2, 3 illustrating the capabilities of our method.
2. Modeling of nematic liquid crystals
We discuss some elementary properties of the so-called Q-tensors and review three models for the equilibrium states of nematic liquid crystals, which derive from minimizing an energy (see [23, 60, 44] for more
details on the modeling of liquid crystals).
2.1. Order Parameters. For a particular material, the transition between phases of different symmetry
can be described in terms of an order parameter. Such a parameter represents the extent to which the
configuration of the more symmetric phase differs from that of the less symmetric phase.
For the sake of clarity, we fix the dimension to be d = 3 in the following discussion. To avoid modeling
individual liquid crystal molecules, that is very expensive computationally, we pursue a macroscopic description of liquid crystals. Namely, let us describe the orientation of the nematic molecules by a probability
distribution in the unit sphere; this gives raise to a tensor field Q : Ω → R3×3 , which is required to be
symmetric and traceless a.e. [23, 60, 44].
We can further characterize Q by its eigenframe and is often written in the form:
1
Q = s1 (n1 ⊗ n1 ) + s2 (n2 ⊗ n2 ) − (s1 + s2 )I,
3
where n1 , n2 are orthonormal eigenvectors of Q, with eigenvalues given by
(1)

λ1 =

2s1 − s2
,
3

λ2 =

2s2 − s1
,
3

λ3 = −

s1 + s2
,
3

where λ3 corresponds to the eigenvector n3 ⊥ n1 , n2 . The eigenvalues of Q are constrained by
(2)

−

1
2
≤ λi ≤ ,
3
3
2

i = 1, 2, 3.

When all eigenvalues are equal, since Q is traceless, we must have λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = 0 and s1 = s2 = 0, i.e.
the distribution of liquid crystal molecules is isotropic. If two eigenvalues are equal, i.e.
λ1 = λ2 ⇔ s1 = s2 ,
λ1 = λ3

⇔

s1 = 0,

λ2 = λ3

⇔

s2 = 0,

then we encounter a uniaxial state, in which either molecules prefer to orient in alignment with the simple
eigenspace (in case it corresponds to a positive eigenvalue) or perpendicular to it (in case it corresponds to
a negative eigenvalue). If all three eigenvalues are distinct, then the state is called biaxial.
Remark 1 (biaxial nematics). In this work, we regard liquid crystal molecules as elongated rods. Naturally,
most liquid crystal molecules do not possess such an axial symmetry. If the molecules resemble a lath more
than a rod, it is expected that the energy interaction can be minimized if the molecules are fully aligned; this
necessarily involves a certain degree of biaxiality. Roughly, this was the rationale behind the prediction of the
biaxial nematic phase by Freiser [27].
Since that seminal work, empirical evidence of biaxial states in certain lyotropic liquid crystals has been
well documented (see [64], for example). Nevertheless, for thermotropic liquid crystals the nematic biaxial
phase remained elusive for a long period, and was first reported long after Freiser’s original prediction [43, 50].
As pointed out by Sonnet and Virga [55, Section 4.1],
The vast majority of nematic liquid crystals do not, at least in homogeneous equilibrium
states, show any sign of biaxiality.
We refer to [14] for further quantitative discussion via computations. In light of Remark 1, in Section 3
we shall consider a uniaxially-constrained model. More precisely, we assume that Q takes the uniaxial state


1
(3)
Q=s n⊗n− I ,
3
where n is the main eigenvector with eigenvalue λ = 2s/3; the other two eigenvalues equal −s/3. The scalar
field s is called the degree of orientation of the liquid crystal molecules. Taking into account identities (1)
and the restrictions (2), it follows that the physically meaningful range is s ∈ (−1/2, 1). In case s = 1, the
molecular long axes are in perfect alignment with the direction of n, whereas s = −1/2 represents the state
in which all molecules are perpendicular to n.
Remark 2 (problems in 2d). The discussion above simplifies considerably when d = 2. Indeed, since Q
is symmetric and traceless, it must be uniaxial, and writing it as Q = s n ⊗ n − 21 I , we deduce that its
eigenvalues are λ1 = s/2, with eigenvector n, and λ2 = −λ1 , with eigenvector n⊥ . Because eigenvalues
are constrained to satisfy λi ∈ (−1/2, 1/2), we deduce that the physically meaningful range is s ∈ (−1, 1).
Actually, one can further simplify to s ∈ [0, 1) by noting that a state with director n and degree of orientation
s < 0 is equivalent to a state with director m ⊥ n and degree of orientation −s.
Remark 3 (thin films). For simplicity, in this work we consider Q to be a square tensor with the same
dimension as the spatial domain. With minor modifications, our approach carries to the case where these
dimensions are different, such as three dimensional tensors on thin films.
2.2. Continuum Mechanics. Given the order parameter Q, we still need a model to determine its state
as a function of space. For modeling equilibrium states, this amounts to finding minimizers of an energy
functional. A common approach from continuum mechanics [34, 57, 59] is to construct the “simplest”
functional possible that is quadratic in gradients of the order parameter while obeying standard laws of
physics, such as frame indifference and material symmetries. We assume all equations have been nondimensionalized; see [28] for the case of the Landau - de Gennes model.
2.2.1. Landau - de Gennes Model. Using Q as the order parameter, we obtain the Landau - de Gennes
model, in which the energy is given by [23, 55]:

Above, {Li }3i=1 , ηB are material parameters, φLdG is a bulk (thermotropic) potential and
|∇Q|2 := (∂k Qij )(∂k Qij ),

|∇ · Q|2 := (∂j Qij )2 ,

(∇Q)T : ∇Q := (∂j Qik )(∂k Qij ),

and we use the convention of summation over repeated indices. This is a relatively simple form for WLdG ;
more complicated models can also be considered [44, 23, 55].
The bulk potential φLdG is a double-well type of function that controls the eigenvalues of Q. The simplest
form is given by
2

where A, B, C are material parameters such that A has no sign, and B, C are positive; K is a convenient
constant. It is typical to let A ≤ 0 since we are interested in uniaxial states, so throughout this paper we
assume that
A ≤ 0,

B, C > 0,

which implies that φLdG (Q) ≥ 0 assuming K is suitably chosen.
2
In two dimensions, tr(Q3 ) = 0, because Q2 = s4 I. Hence, B is irrelevant in 2d, and it is necessary that A
be strictly negative in order to have a stable nematic phase. This also implies that φLdG is an even function
of s if Q is uniaxial (see Remark 2).
As a simplification, one can take L1 = 1, L2 = L3 = 0 in (4) to obtain a one-constant approximation

2.2.2. Ericksen Model. Though the Landau - de Gennes model is quite general, it can be fairly expensive
when d = 3. In such a case, since Q ∈ R3×3 and symmetric, it has five independent variables. Moreover,
the bulk potential φLdG is a non-linear function of Q, which couples all five variables together when seeking
a minimizer of ELdG .
Assuming that Q is uniaxial (3), we can take s and n as order parameters. In the same way as (6), we
have a one-constant Ericksen model:

where κ > 0 is a single material parameter, and φerk is a double-well potential acting on s, which is taken
from the Landau - de Gennes case: φerk (s) = φLdG (Q(s)), where Q is any matrix having the form (3).
Remark 4 (Oseen-Frank model). In case the degree of orientation
´ is a non-zero constant field, the energy
Eerk effectively reduces to the Oseen-Frank energy [60]: EOF [n] := Ω |∇n|2 . The Oseen-Frank model has been
used extensively in the modeling of liquid crystal-based flat panel displays. Minimizers of the one-constant
energy in such a model are director fields n : Ω → Sd−1 satisfying ∆n − λn = 0, where λ is a Lagrange
multiplier that enforces the unit length constraint.
In the Oseen-Frank model, point defects in three dimensional domains have finite energy. However, this
model is incapable of capturing higher-dimensional defects, that is, defects supported either on lines or planes.
Since these naturally occur in many liquid crystal systems, this is a major inherent limitation of the OseenFrank model.
We point out that (7) is degenerate, in the sense that s may vanish; this allows for n to have discontinuities
(i.e. defects) with finite energy. Indeed, the hallmark of this model is to regularize defects using s, but still
retain part of the Oseen-Frank model. Discontinuities in n may still occur in the singular set
(8)

S := {x ∈ Ω : s(x) = 0}.

For problems in R3 , because n ∈ S2 , it is uniquely defined by two parameters. Thus, in such a case the
Ericksen model only has three scalar order parameters, as opposed to five in the Landau - de Gennes model.
Another advantage of the Ericksen model is that s and n provide a natural way to split the system which is
convenient for numerical purposes. Additionally, the parameter κ in (7) plays a major role in the´ occurrence
of defects. Assuming that s equals a sufficiently large positive constant on ∂Ω, if κ is large, then Ω κ|∇s|2 dx
dominates the energy and s stays close to such a positive constant within the domain Ω. Thus, defects are
4

´
less likely to occur. If κ is small (say κ < 1), then Ω s2 |∇n|2 dx dominates the energy, and s may vanish in
regions of Ω and induce a defect. This is confirmed by the numerical experiments in [45, 46].
Remark 5 (orientability). Director field models –either Oseen-Frank or Ericksen– are more than adequate
in some situations, although in general they introduce a nonphysical orientational bias into the problem.
Even though liquid crystal molecules may be polar, in nematics one always finds that the states with n and
−n are equivalent [31]. At the molecular level, this means that the same number of molecules point “up” and
“down.” Therefore, line-fields are more appropriate for modeling nematic liquid crystals.
Another issue with the use of the vector field n as an order parameter instead of the matrix Q is that the
only allowable defects in such a case are integer order defects. On the other hand Q, specifically n ⊗ n in (3),
is able to represent line fields having half-integer defects. These have been largely observed and documented
in experiments; see for example [17, 48] and references therein. We point out that, if a line field is orientable,
then a vector field representation is essentially equivalent [8, 9].
3. Mathematical formulation
In this work, we will be concerned with the one-constant energy for Q, given by (6). Enforcing Q to
be symmetric and traceless, one can, in principle, directly minimize such an energy. For three-dimensional
problems, a standard approach to finding minimizers [5, 58, 55, 36] is to express Q(x) as


q1 q3
q4
,
q5
(9)
Q(x) =  q3 q2
q4 q5 −(q1 + q2 )
i.e. minimize (6) with respect to the order parameters´ {qi (x)}5i=1 . This approach has two drawbacks.
First, a basic argument shows that minimizers of Ω φLdG have the form of a uniaxial nematic (3) [55].
This is false for ELdG,one in (6) with general boundary conditions. Thus, minimizers of the form (9) violate
the algebraic form of (3) and exhibit a biaxial escape [49, 54, 38]. This is analogous to the escape to the
3rd dimension in liquid crystal director models [60]. This is not desirable if the underlying nematic liquid
crystal is guaranteed to be uniaxial (recall Remark 1). Secondly, minimizing (6) with Q of the form (9) leads
to a non-linear system with five coupled variables in 3d, so it is expensive to solve and possibly not robust
[39, 51, 65, 66].
These drawbacks motivate us to enforce the uniaxiallity constraint (3) directly in the Landau - de Gennes
one-constant energy (6). The ensuing model has similarities with the Ericksen model (7), although it has the
advantage of allowing minimizers to exhibit half-integer order defects. Our approach hinges on previous work
on the Ericksen model [45, 47, 46], which exploits a hidden structure of (7). We next reveal such structure
for the Landau - de Gennes model with uniaxial constraint and point out the corresponding counterpart for
the Ericksen model when appropriate. Compared to directly minimizing (6) using (9), our algorithm finds a
minimizer by solving a sequence of linear systems of smaller dimension. However, our approach is equivalent
to directly minimizing the energy (6) for two-dimensional problems (see Remark 2).
3.1. The Basic Structure. We start with the main part (elastic energy) of the one-constant Ericksen
model in (7), namely
ˆ 

1
κ|∇s|2 dx + s2 |∇n|2 dx.
(10)
Eerk−m [s, n] :=
2 Ω
It is clear that a configuration (s, n) with finite elastic energy implies s ∈ H 1 (Ω) and that the weight s
vanishing within the singular set S of (8) allows for director fields n with infinite Dirichlet energy and thus
for the presence of defects. The hidden structure in (10) becomes apparent upon introducing the auxiliary
variable u = sn as proposed first in [4, 40]: since |n| = 1 we get ∇n n = 0 and the pointwise orthogonal
decomposition ∇u = n ⊗ ∇s + s∇n. Consequently, (10) can be equivalently written
ˆ 

eerk−m [s, u] := 1
(11)
Eerk−m [s, n] = E
(κ − 1)|∇s|2 + |∇u|2 dx,
2 Ω
to discover that u ∈ [H 1 (Ω)]d . Moreover, it is apparent from (11) that if κ > 1 the Ericksen energy
eerk−m [s, u] is convex with respect to (s, u). The physically relevant case 0 < κ < 1 in terms of defects is
E
5

eerk−m [s, u] is no longer obvious
more difficult with regard to proving Γ-convergence, because convexity of E
unless we exploit the relation |s| = |u|. This relation can only be enforced at the nodes of a finite element
eerk−m [s, u] become
approximation of (s, u), whence convexity as well as weak lower semi-continuity of E
problematic [45, 46, 47]; we will refer to this issue later in Lemma 6.
We now turn to the Landau - de Gennes model with uniaxial constraint (3). To this end, we introduce
the line field Θ = n ⊗ n, which will be treated as a control variable in minimizing (6) subject to (3). Since
∇Q is a 3-tensor of the form ∇Q = ∇s ⊗ Θ − d1 I + s∇Θ, we have

Therefore, we obtain the first relation with the Ericksen model

The second one comes from the equalities
s2 = C2 tr(Q2 ),

s3 = C3 tr(Q3 ),

s4 = C4 (tr(Q2 ))2 ,

which are valid for suitable constants C2 , C3 , C4 > 0. Consequently, the double-well potential φLdG (Q) in
(5) becomes a quartic function ψLdG (s) = φLdG (Q) of s that blows-up at the end points of the interval

then the Landau - de Gennes total energy Euni−t [s, Θ] = ELdG,one [Q] in (6) reads
(12)

Euni−t [s, Θ] = Euni−m [s, Θ] + ELdG,bulk [s].

We see that this energy has the same form as the Ericksen energy (7), except that Θ replaces n and
κ = (d − 1)/d < 1. This motivates a change of variable analogous to the one in the Ericksen model: we set
U := sΘ and note that ∇U = ∇s ⊗ Θ + s∇Θ is a d-tensor with orthogonal components, whence
|∇U|2 = |∇s|2 + s2 |∇Θ|2
and the main and total energies in terms of (s, U) read

then (s, U) ∈ H 1 (Ω) × [H 1 (Ω)]d×d but in general Θ ∈
/ [H 1 (Ω)]d×d because the presence of the weight s2 in
Euni−i [s, Θ] allows for blow-up of ∇Θ in the singular set S of (8). We intend to preserve this basic structure
discretely. In fact, this will be crucial later in Section 5 to interpret ∇Θ in the Lebesgue L2 sense and recover
the orthogonality relation |∇U|2 = |∇s|2 + s2 |∇Θ|2 a.e. in Ω \ S, as well as to derive Γ convergence.
In order to define the admissible class of functions, we begin with the set of line fields
(15)

Ld−1 := {A ∈ Rd×d : there exists n ∈ Sd−1 , A = n ⊗ n}.

We say that a triple (s, Θ, U) satisfies the structural condition provided

Auni := (s, Θ, U) ∈ H 1 (Ω) × [L∞ (Ω)]d×d × [H 1 (Ω)]d×d : (s, Θ, U) satisfies (16) ,
To enforce boundary conditions, let (Γs , ΓΘ , ΓU ) with ΓΘ = ΓU be open subsets of ∂Ω where we impose

This will lead to confinement of s with the interval [− d−1

4. Discretization
Let Th = {T } be a conforming shape-regular and quasi-uniform triangulation of Ω made of simplices. Let
Nh = {xi }N
i=1 be the set of nodes (vertices) xi of Th and N be its cardinality. Let φi be the standard “hat”
basis function associated with the node xi ∈ Nh . We indicate with ωi = supp φi the patch of a node xi (i.e.
the “star” of elements in Th that contain the vertex xi ). For simplicity we assume that Ω = Ωh , so that
there is no geometric error caused by domain approximation. We further assume that Th is weakly acute,
namely
ˆ
(20)
kij := −
∇φi · ∇φj dx ≥ 0 for all i 6= j.
Ω

Condition (20) ensures the validity of the discrete maximum principle. However, (20) imposes a severe
geometric restriction on Th [18, 56], especially in three dimensions.
We consider three continuous piecewise linear Lagrange finite element spaces on Ω:
Sh := {sh ∈ H 1 (Ω) : sh |T is affine for all T ∈ Th },
Uh := {Uh ∈ [H 1 (Ω)]d×d : each entry of Uh |T is afffine for all T ∈ Th },
Th := {Θh ∈ Uh : Θh (xi ) ∈ Ld−1 , for all xi ∈ Nh },
where Th imposes both the rank-one and unit-norm constraints only at the vertices of the mesh Th . We say
that the discrete triple (sh , Θh , Uh ) ∈ Sh × Th × Uh satisfies the discrete structural condition if

boundary conditions within the discrete spaces:
Sh (gh ) := {sh ∈ Sh : sh |Γs = gh },
Uh (Rh ) := {Uh ∈ Uh : Uh |ΓU = Rh },
Th (Mh ) := {Θh ∈ Th : Θh |ΓΘ = Mh }.

In view of (18), the following compatibility condition must hold: Mh = Ih [gh−1 Rh ] on ΓΘ . This leads to the
following discrete admissible class with boundary conditions:

(sh , Uh , Θn ) satisfies (21) ,

Because the discrete spaces consist of piecewise linear functions, the structural condition Uh = sh Θh is
only satisfied at the mesh nodes (cf. (21)). Therefore, there is a variational crime that we need to account
for. To this end, we now derive energy inequalities similar to [46, Lemma 2.2]. Although the arguments are
the same, we present the proof for completeness. For our analysis, we introduce the functions

Xh := Sh × Th × Uh ,

5.1. Lim-sup property: Existence of a recovery sequence. Our goal is to show the following property:
given (s, Θ, U) ∈ X, there exists a sequence (sh , Θh , Uh ) ∈ Ahuni (gh , Mh ) such that
(31)

k(s, U) − (sh , Uh )kH 1 (Ω) → 0,

Truncation. Naturally, the interesting case to consider is when (s, Θ) ∈ Auni (g, M); otherwise the property
above is trivially true. As shown in [46, Lemma 3.1], hypotheses (17) and (19) make it possible to assume
that the degree of orientation s is sufficiently far from the boundary of the physically meaningful range

b ∈ Auni (g, R) whereas (19) yields ψLdG (ŝ, Θ) ≤ ψLdG (ŝ, Θ).
Proof. We first observe that (17) implies (ŝ, Θ, U)
Moreover, making use of |ŝ| ≤ |s| and |∇b
s| ≤ |∇s| a.e. in Ω, the inequality Euni−m [ŝ, Θ] ≤ Euni−m [s, Θ]
follows immediately.

Remark 6 (range of s). For problems in 3d, the admissibility condition s ∈ [−1/2, 1] is asymmetric with
respect to the origin. Since part of our argument below is based on regularizing |s| and afterwards recovering
its sign, we need to account for such an asymmetry. A simple way to do so is to consider
(33)

š = s+ − 2s− .

Clearly, the first condition in (16) is equivalent to
−1 ≤ š ≤ 1.
In the next result, we consider the regularization using this modified degree of orientation; for simplicity of
notation, we drop the “check” in s.
Rank-one constraint. Our regularization method entails smoothing by convolution. This breaks the
uniaxial constraint (3), that needs to be rebuilt into the smoothed tensor field; hence, we extract the leading
eigenspace. We thus need to account for the dependence of eigenvalues with respect to matrix perturbations.
Let Sym(d) denote the set of symmetric d × d matrices. Given A ∈ Sym(d), let λ1 ≥ . . . ≥ λd be the
eigenvalues of A including multiplicities and λm(1) > · · · > λm(n) be the 1 ≤ n ≤ d distinct eigenvalues. Let
{Pk }nk=1 be the orthogonal projections onto the eigenspaces associated with {λm(k) }nk=1 and let r(k) ≥ 1 be
the rank of Pk ; hence r(k) is the multiplicity of λm(k) for 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The spectral decomposition of A reads
Pn
A = k=1 λm(k) Pk We now consider the set S 1,0 (d) of non-negative symmetric tensors of rank at most one,

S 1,0 (d) = A ∈ Sym(d) : A = u ⊗ u for some u ∈ Rd ,
and follow [7] to construct the projection operator Π : Sym(d) → S 1,0 (d) defined by
(34)

Π(A) = (λ1 − λ2 )P1 .

The map Π is Lipschitz continuous. This is proven in [7, Lemma 3.4] with an explicit Lipschitz constant
1
3 + 21+ p (in the `p -norm). We give an elementary proof below which relies on the following basic result.
10

Lemma 3 (C 1 property of Π). The map Sym(d) → Rd , given by A 7→ (λ1 (A), . . . , λd (A)), is continuous.
Moreover, in the set of symmetric matrices whose first eigenspace has dimension 1
Sym1 (d) := {A ∈ Sym(d) : λ1 (A) > λ2 (A)},
or equivalently the rank of P1 is 1, the map Π is of class C 1 .
Proof. The eigenvalues {λi (A)}di=1 are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of A and depend continuously on the coefficients and so on the entries of A. To show the C 1 property around A0 ∈ Sym1 (d), let
A ∈ Sym(d) and x1 = x1 (A) be a normalized eigenvector corresponding to the first eigenvalue λ1 = λ1 (A).
The equation that defines (x1 , λ1 ) and its derivative with respect to (x1 , λ1 ) read

Since λ1 (A0 ) is single, the matrix Dx1 ,λ1 F(x1 (A0 ), λ1 (A0 ), A0 ) is invertible for otherwise if (y, α)T ∈ Rd+1

giving the existence of (x1 (A), λ1 (A)) and its C 1 dependence on A; we refer to [25, Chapter 11.1, Theorem
2] for a different argument. To prove that λ2 (A) is also C 1 we proceed similarly but note that this eigenvalue
might have multiplicity r(2) > 1. We thus form the equation for P2 = P2 (A) ∈ Rd×d being a matrix with
rank r(2) and λ2 = λ2 (A)

Lemma 4 (Lipschitz property of Π). The map Π : Sym(d) → S 1,0 (d) is uniformly Lipschitz continuous and
is invariant on S 1,0 (d), i.e. Π(A) = A for all A ∈ S 1,0 (d).
Proof. The invariance of Π over S 1,0 (d) is clear from its definition. Given A, B = A + δA ∈ Sym(d), write

Π(B) − Π(A) = λ1 (B) − λ1 (A) − λ2 (B) − λ2 (A) P1 (B) + λ1 (A) − λ2 (A) P1 (B) − P1 (A) .
We examine the two terms on the right hand side separately. We split the proof into three steps.
Step 1: Lipschitz property of the first term. We resort to Weyl’s inequality for eigenvalues of symmetric
matrices [13, Section III.2]
λk (B) − λk (A) ≤ kB − Ak2 ∀1 ≤ k ≤ d.
Since kP1 (B)k2 = 1 because P1 (B) is an orthogonal projection, this proves the Lipschitz property for the
first term with constant 2. If λ1 (A) is a multiple eigenvalue, then λ1 (A) = λ2 (A), the second term vanishes,
and the proof is over. We thus assume that λ1 (A) is simple from now on.
Step 2: Bound on kDA x1 (A; δA)k2 . In view of Lemma 3 (C 1 property of Π), we differentiate the equation
F(x1 (A), λ1 (A), A) = [0, 1]T with respect to A in the direction δA to obtain Dx1 F DA x1 + Dλ1 F DA λ1 +
DA F : δA = 0 where DA x1 = DA x1 (A; δA) and DA λ1 = DA λ1 (A; δA). Making use of Lemma 3 again,
we thus deduce the equation in Rd+1

∀ 2 ≤ k ≤ d.

Let α = (αk )dk=1 with α1 = 0 and β = (βk )dk=1 . Since kβk2 ≤ kδAk2 , we see that
kDA x1 (A; δA)k2 = kαk2 ≤

kδAk2
,
λ1 (A) − λ2 (A)

because 0 < λ1 (A) − λ2 (A) ≤ λ1 (A) − λk (A) for all 2 ≤ k ≤ d.
Step 3: Lipschitz property of the second term. Exploiting that P1 (A) = x1 (A) ⊗ x1 (A), we readily get
DA P1 (A; δA) = DA x1 (A; δA) ⊗ x1 (A) + x1 (A) ⊗ DA x1 (A; δA).
Since x1 (A) and DA x1 (A; δA) are perpendicular, we infer that
(35)

kDA P1 (A; δA)k2 ≤ kDA x1 (A; δA)k2 .

Indeed, if u, v ∈ Rd are orthonormal and w ∈ Rd , then (u ⊗ v + v ⊗ u)w = (v · w)u + (u · w)v, and thus,
by Bessel’s inequality,
k(u ⊗ v + v ⊗ u)wk2 ≤ kwk2 ;
estimate (35) then follows by scaling. Combining this with Step 2 gives

λ1 (A) − λ2 (A) kP1 (A + δA) − P1 (A)k2 ≤ kδAk2 + λ1 (A) − λ2 (A) o(kδAk2 ) = 1 + o(1) kδAk2 ,
which shows that the desired Lipschitz constant is 1. Altogether the uniform Lipschitz constant of Π (with
respect to the `2 -norm) is 3. This concludes the proof.

Regularization. We now have all the tools we need to prove that Lipschitz continuous functions are dense
in the Landau - de Gennes restricted admissible class Auni (g, R).
Proposition 7 (regularization). Let (18), (19) and (33) hold. Given ε > 0 and (s, Θ, U) ∈ Auni (g, R) with
(36)

−1 + δ0 ≤ s ≤ 1 − δ0

a.e. Ω

there exists a sequence (sε , Θε , Uε ) ∈ Auni (g, R) such that (sε , Uε ) ∈ W 1,∞ (Ω) × [W 1,∞ (Ω)]d×d , and
(37)

k(s, U) − (sε , Uε )kH 1 (Ω) < ε,

kΘ − Θε kL2 (Ω\S) < ε,

−1 + δ0 ≤ sε ≤ 1 − δ0 .

Proof. We proceed in several steps.
Step 1: Regularization with boundary condition. Consider a zero-extension of s − g ∈ H01 (Ω) over Rd \ Ω.
Given δ > 0, we set
ωδ := {x ∈ Ω : d(x, ∂Ω) ≤ δ},
1
and define dδ (x) = χΩ (x) min δ d(x, ∂Ω), 1 , which is a Lipschitz continuous function, with supp(∇dδ ) ⊂ ωδ
and |∇dδ | = δ −1 χωδ . Let ηδ be a smooth, nonnegative mollifier supported in Bδ (0), and define

Uσ,δ := ρσ (sδ )Π(U

Since tr[Π(U
e σ,δ ) satisfies the structural condition (16).
we have Uσ,δ = sσ,δ Θσ,δ for some Θσ,δ ∈ Ld−1 and (sσ,δ , Θσ,δ , U
Under assumption (18), it follows that if σ < δ0 then sδ = g > σ on ∂Ω, so that ρσ (sδ ) = 1 on ∂Ω. Thus,

Therefore, (sσ,δ , Θσ,δ , Uσ,δ ) ∈ Auni (g, R, M). We still need to choose σ and δ such that (sσ,δ , Uσ,δ ) is
sufficiently close to (s, U) in [H 1 (Ω)]1+d×d .
Step 3: Convergence as δ → 0. Since Π is Lipschitz in view of Lemma 4, it is immediate to see that

because ∇v = 0 a.e. in {v = 0} for any v ∈ H 1 (Ω) [25, Ch. 5, Exercise 17]. We have thus proved that
∇(Uσ − U) → 0 in L2 (Ω) as σ → 0.

∇(sσ − s) = ∇ |ρσ (s)| − 1 tr(U) = ∇|ρσ (s)| tr(U) + |ρσ (s)| − 1 |∇tr(U)|.
This expression has the same structure as ∇(Uσ − U) except that U is now replaced by tr(U). Therefore,
the same argument as before yields as σ → 0
∇(sσ − s) → 0

in L2 (Ω).

Step 5: Choice of σ and δ. Given ε > 0, we first choose σ > 0 such that
kUσ − UkH 1 (Ω) ≤ ε/2,

ksσ − skH 1 (Ω) ≤ ε/2,

kΘ − Θχ{|s|> σ2 } kL2 (Ω\S) ≤ ε/2,

because χ{|s|> σ2 } → χ{|s|>0} a.e. as σ → 0 and Ω \ S = {|s| > 0}. Since χ{0<|s|≤ σ2 } → 0 a.e. and |Θσ,δ | = 1,
we can further reduce σ so that
kΘσ,δ kL2 ({0<|s|≤ σ2 }) ≤ ε/4.
Finally, take δ ≤ σ such that
kUσ,δ − Uσ kH 1 (Ω) ≤ ε/2,

ksσ,δ − sσ kH 1 (Ω) ≤ ε/2,

kΘσ,δ − ΘkL2 ({|s|> σ2 }) ≤ ε/4.

The proof concludes upon defining (sε , Θε , Uε ) := (sσ,δ , Θσ,δ , Uσ,δ ).

With this regularization result at hand, we
 now address the construction of a recovery sequence. Given
ε > 0, let (sε,h , Uε,h ) := Ih (sε,h ), Ih (Uε,h ) be the Lagrange interpolants of the regularized pair (sε , Uε )
constructed in Proposition 7, that are well-defined because (sε , Uε ) ∈ W 1,∞ (Ω) × [W 1,∞ (Ω)]d×d . We define
the line field Θε,h ∈ Th so that, at the node xi ∈ Nh it satisfies

Uε (xi )/sε (xi )
if sε (xi ) 6= 0,
Θε,h (xi ) =
any tensor in Ld−1 if sε (xi ) = 0.
This definition guarantees that Uε,h = Ih (sε,h Θε,h ), whence the structural condition (21) is satisfied and
thus (sε,h , Θε,h , Uε,h ) ∈ Ahuni (gh , Rh ). Because (sε,h , Uε,h ) → (sε , Uε ) in H 1 (Ω) × [H 1 (Ω)]d×d as h → 0,
we readily deduce that (31) is satisfied. Proving (32) is equivalent to showing that E h → 0, the consistency
term in (30), and can be done using the same arguments as in [46, Lemma 3.3]. We omit the proof.

Our next goal is to show that, from sequences of discrete functions (sh , Θh , Uh ) and (e

uniformly bounded energies, it is possible to extract subsequences that converge to admissible functions. For
that purpose, we need an elementary auxiliary result.
Lemma 8 (admissible tensors). Let M ∈ Sym(d) be such that tr(Mk ) = [tr(M)]k for all k = 1, . . . , d. Then,
at least d − 1 eigenvalues of M are equal to zero, i.e., M has rank less than or equal to 1.

, a.e. in Ω, and weakly in H (Ω) × [H (Ω)]d×d . The rest of the proof is about
characterizing these limits. We proceed in three steps.
Step 1: Trace constraint. To show that se = |s|, we use a standard approximation estimate for the Lagrange
interpolant and the fact that |∇|sh || = |∇sh | a.e.:

ke
sh − |sh |kL2 (Ω) = kIh |sh | − |sh |kL2 (Ω) ≤ Chk∇|sh |kL2 (Ω) ≤ CΛh.
This, together with the triangle inequality and the fact that sh → s, seh → se in L2 (Ω), give
se − |s| ≤ se − seh v| + seh − |sh | + |sh | − |s| → 0

as h → 0.

e Indeed, since sh = Ih (tr[Uh ]), we have
Using a similar argument, we can show that s = tr[U] and se = tr[U].
ktr[Uh ] − sh kL2 (Ω) ≤ Chk∇(tr[Uh ])kL2 (Ω) ≤ CΛh,
and thus
tr[U] − s ≤ tr[U] − tr[Uh ] + tr[Uh ] − sh + sh − s → 0

as h → 0.

e have rank at most 1; this is a new issue
Step 2: Rank-one constraint. We now show that both U and U
relative to [46]. In order to apply Lemma 8, it suffices to check that
sk = tr[Uk ],

e k ] ∀k = 2, . . . , d.
sek = tr[U

Since the two identities above follow from the same argument, we just prove the first one. Let 2 ≤ k ≤ d.
The discrete admissibility condition (21) implies that skh (xi ) = tr[Uh (xi )k ] for all xi ∈ Nh , whence Ih (skh ) =
Ih (tr[Ukh ]). In a similar fashion as before, we use the triangle inequality to write
sk − tr[Uk ] ≤ sk − skh + skh − Ih (skh ) + Ih (tr[Ukh ]) − tr[Ukh ] + tr[Ukh ] − tr[Uk ] .
The first and last terms in the right hand side tend to 0 a.e., because sh → s and Uh → U. Next, we note
that |∇skh | = k|sh |k−1 |∇sh | ≤ d|∇sh |, because |sh | ≤ 1, whence
kskh − Ih (skh )kL2 (Ω) ≤ CΛh → 0,

as h → 0.

The estimate
kIh (tr[Ukh ]) − tr[Ukh ]kL2 (Ω) ≤ CΛh → 0, as h → 0,
e have rank ≤ 1 a.e.
follows in a similar fashion. This proves that U and U
Step 3: Line field Θ. Because s = tr[U], it follows that rank(U) = 1 if and only if s 6= 0. Therefore, we can
define a line field Θ : Ω \ S → Ld−1 by Θ = s−1 U, and extend Θ to S by any arbitrary tensor in Ld−1 .
17

We next show that Θh → Θ a.e. in Ω \ S and in L2 (Ω \ S). We note that at every element T ∈ Th ,
the second derivatives of sh and Θh vanish, because these functions are piecewise linear. Thus, ksh Θh −
Ih (sh Θh )kL1 (T ) ≤ Ch2 k∇sh ⊗ ∇Θh kL1 (T ) , and summing over all elements T ∈ Th , we obtain
ksh Θh − Ih (sh Θh )kL1 (Ω) ≤ Ch2 k∇sh ⊗ ∇Θh kL1 (Ω) ≤ Ch2 k∇sh kL2 (Ω) k∇Θh kL2 (Ω) .
Since |Θh | ≤ 1, an inverse inequality yields k∇Θh kL2 (Ω) ≤ Ch−1 and therefore
(40)

ksh Θh − Ih (sh Θh )kL1 (Ω) ≤ CΛh → 0

as h → 0.

Noticing that Ih (sh Θh ) = Uh → U, we deduce that sh Θh → U a.e. in Ω as h → 0. Since sh → s a.e., for
almost every x ∈ Ω \ S it holds that sh (x) 6= 0 if h is sufficiently small, and we deduce
Θh (x) =

sh (x)Θh (x)

Convergence Θh → Θ in L2 (Ω\S) now follows by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, as |Θh | ≤ 1. Finally,

work. Using a standard argument [15, 16, 21], we can prove the convergence of discrete global minimizers.
Theorem 1 (convergence of discrete global minimizers). Let (sh , Θh , Uh ) ∈ Ahuni (gh , Rh ) be a sequence of

global minimizers of the discrete total energy Euni−t

Euni−t [t0 , N0 ] + ε/2

and, in view of Proposition 7, we can take (tε , Nε , Vε ) ∈ Auni (g, R) with (tε , Vε ) ∈ W 1,∞ (Ω)×[W 1,∞ (Ω)]d×d
such that
euni−m [tε , Vε ] ≤ E
euni−m [t, V] + ε/4 = Euni−m [t, N] + ε/4.
Euni−m [tε , Nε ] = E
Moreover, because tε → t a.e. in Ω so does ψLdG (tε ) → ψLdG (t). Since (19) and (37) imply that |ψLdG (tε )|
is uniformly bounded, we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem to deduce that

Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, this proves that (s, Θ) is a global minimizer of Euni−t .



In case there is a unique global minimizer of the continuous total energy Euni−t , Theorem 1 implies that
the entire sequence of discrete global energy minimizers converges to it strongly in L2 and weakly in H 1 .
We also point out that a well-known result in Γ-convergence theory [37] guarantees that, for every isolated
h
local minimizer of Euni−t there is a sequence of local minimizers of Euni−t
that converges to it in the same
sense. However, in either case, because of the lack of continuous dependence on data as well as regularity
theory, we cannot derive convergence rates.
6. Computation of discrete minimizers

according to (26), we write the discrete total energy as

Tangential variations. The algorithm we discuss here is an alternating direction method that, at each
step k ≥ 0, first performs a tangential variation on the current line field Θh = nkh ⊗ nkh , then normalizes the
update, and finally performs a gradient flow step on the current degree of orientation sh . The director field
nkh belongs to
Nh = {vh ∈ [Sh ]d : vh (xi ) ∈ Sd−1 ∀xi ∈ Nh },
whereas a tangential variation tkh belongs to the space
k
d
k
N⊥
h (nh ) = {vh ∈ [Sh ] : vh (xi ) · nh (xi ) = 0 ∀xi ∈ Nh }.

It is easy to see that tangential variations Tkh of Θkh are of the form

with tkh ∈ N⊥

The extra quadratic term can be handled if we have control of tkh in an H 1 (Ω)-type space. This dictates the
metric of the gradient flow. Bartels and Raisch first proposed the metric H 1 (Ω) provided skh > 0 is constant
20

[12]. In our case, skh may vary across the domain and may even vanish to allow for the formation of defects.
Near the singular set, where skh is small, it is critical to allow for relatively large variations tkh in order to
accelerate the algorithm. We achieve this via the weight ω = (skh )2 and corresponding weighted H 1 -norm

Remark 8 (CFL condition). The stability constraint τ ≤ CEuni−t [s0h , Θ0h ]−1/2 hd/2 is due to the weighted
Hω1 (Ω) norm and the use of an inverse estimate between L∞ (Ω) and L2 (Ω). If the weight ω = (skh )2 is
bounded away from zero, then the CFL condition is milder, namely τ ≤ CEuni−t [s0h , Θ0h ]−1/2 hd/2−1 | log h|
[12]. The weight ω is critical because it accelerates the algoritm upon allowing large variations of Θkh near
defects where it becomes small.
7. Numerical Experiments
To illustrate our method, we present computational experiments carried out with the MATLAB/C++
toolbox FELICITY [61]. We first consider a problem for the Landau - de Gennes energy with orientable
Dirichlet boundary conditions. In such a case, the resulting line field of degree +1 is orientable, and the
energy minimization problem is equivalent to the one given by minimizing the Ericksen energy; this allows
us to compare with [46]. Afterwards, we illustrate the method’s ability to capture non-orientable defects of
degree +1/2 in two and three dimensional experiments, the latter leading to a non-straight line defect. We
conclude with a Saturn-ring defect of degree −1/2 around a colloidal spherical inclusion.
7.1. Ericksen vs. Landau de Gennes. It is known that, if the line field is orientable, then a director
field representation is equivalent. Thus, we compare the solutions for the Ericksen and the Landau - de
Gennes model with orientable boundary conditions. In this first experiment we are not taking into account
the double-well potential. If Θ = m ⊗ m is an orientable line field, then a straightforward calculation gives
|∇Θ|2 = 2|∇m|2 , and therefore

and compare the minimizers of the discrete energies Eerk−m
(with κ = 41 ) and Euni−m

gradient flows with s = 1/2 and a point defect away from the center. Figure 2 shows the equilibrium configuh

n (right) are displayed. In this case, the line field is orientable, so both the Ericksen model
and uniaxially constrained model give the same result.

7.2. Non-orientable field in two dimensions. Next, we simulate a non-orientable defect in the unit
square Ω = (0, 1)2 . We set the double-well potential with a convex splitting
ψLdG (s) = ψc (s) − ψe (s)
:= (26.20577s2 + 1) − (−4.1649313s4 + 30.2874s2 ),
with ηB = 1/16, and note that ψLdG has a local maximum at s = 0 and a global minimum at s = s∗ := 0.7
with ψLdG (s∗ ) = 0 (by symmetry in two dimensions, ψLdG (−s∗ ) = 0). We impose Dirichlet boundary
conditions for both s and Θ on Γs = ΓΘ = ∂Ω,

a +1/2 degree defect centered at (0.5, 0.5). We initialize the gradient flow with s = s∗ and Θ corresponding
h
to a +1/2 degree defect located at (0.7167, 0.2912), which has initial energy Euni
[sh , Θh ] = 18.5468. We
show the final equilibrium configurations of s and the tensor field Θ in Figure 3. The method clearly

captures the non-orientable defect at the domain center. The final state has Euni

7.3. Line defect in three dimensions. We simulate a non-orientable line defect in the unit cube (0, 1)3 .
The double-well potential with a convex splitting is given by
ψLdG (s) = ψc (s) − ψe (s)
:= (36.7709s2 + 1) − (−7.39101s4 + 4.51673s3 + 39.27161s2 ),
with ηB = 1/16, and note that ψLdG has a local maximum at s = 0 and a global minimum at s = s∗ :=
0.700005531 with ψLdG (s∗ ) = 0.
The boundary conditions for Θ were constructed in the following way. Let θ0 (x, y) define a +1/2 degree
defect in the plane, located at (0.3, 0.3) similar to (54). Likewise, let θ1 (x, y) define a +1/2 degree defect
in the plane, located at (0.7, 0.7). Next, define the Dirichlet boundary Γs = ΓΘ = ∂Ω \ Γo , where Γo :=
Ω ∩ ({z = 0} ∪ {z = 1}). Then, the Dirichlet conditions are
s = s∗ ,

n(x, y) = (cos θ, sin θ, 0),

Θ = n ⊗ n,
25

θ(x, y, z) = (1 − z)θ0 (x, y) + zθ1 (x, y) + πz,

with vanishing Neumann condition on Γo . Basically, the boundary conditions consist of rotating a planar
+1/2 degree point defect as a function of z. The solution is computed with the gradient flow approach (45)
and time step τ = 10−3 , and initialized with
s = s∗ ,

n = (cos α, sin α, 0),

Θ = n ⊗ n,

α(x, y, z) = θ2 (x, y) + πz,

where θ2 (x, y) corresponds to a +1/2 degree defect centered at (0.5, 0.5); this configuration has an initial
h
energy of Euni
[sh , Θh ] = 10.013214.
Figure 4 shows three dimensional views of the minimizing configuration, where as Figure 5 shows four
h
horizontal slices of the solution. A non-orientable line defect is observed, with final energy Euni
[sh , Θh ] =
−2
5.2042593769 and min(sh ) ≈ 2.145 × 10 .

Figure 4. A +1/2 degree line defect in a 3-D cube domain (Section 7.3). Left: line field
Θ is shown at levels z = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 (colored by s). Right: The s = 0.05 iso-surface is
shown that contains the line defect. In each horizontal plane, the line field exhibits a +1/2
degree point defect in 2-D. The twisting of the line defect is due to the choice of boundary
conditions.

7.4. Saturn-ring Defect. Next, we simulate the Saturn-ring defect [2, 32] using the double well potential
from Section 7.3
ηB = 0.09. The domain Ω is a “prism” type of cylindrical domain with square cross√ with √
section [−0.25 2, 0.75 2]2 , is centered about the √
z = 0 √plane, and has height 6. The
√ domain contains a
spherical inclusion, with boundary Γi , centered at ( 2/4, 2/4, 0) with radius 0.283/ 2. See [47, Sec. 5.1.1]
for a precise definition.
We use the following Dirichlet boundary conditions on Γs = ΓΘ = ∂Ω,
n = ν, on Γi ,

n = (0, 0, 1)T , on Γo ,

Θ = n ⊗ n, on ∂Ω,

s = s∗ , on ∂Ω,

where Γo is the outer boundary of Ω, ν is the outer normal vector of the spherical inclusion, and s∗ is the
global minimum of the double well potential ψ. The initial conditions in Ω for the gradient flow are: s = s∗
h
[sh , Θh ] = 7.59906.
and n = (0, 0, 1)T , which have initial energy Euni
We show the final equilibrium configurations of s and the tensor field Θ in Figure 6. A cross-section of
the solution is shown that illustrates the −1/2 degree nature of the Saturn-ring defect (note: the defect set
h
of a ring about the equator of the inclusion). The final state has Euni
[sh , Θh ] = 2.98004 and min(sh ) ≈
−2
5.026 × 10 . In contrast to our previous experiments using the Ericksen model [47], this new simulation is
consistent with the physics of liquid crystals [2, 32].

in Figure 4 (Section 7.3). Top: left is z = 0.2, right is z = 0.4. Bottom: left is z = 0.6,
right is z = 0.8. The location of the point defect in each plane rotates with the boundary
conditions.
8. Conclusions
We introduced a structure-preserving finite element method for a uniaxially-constrained Q-tensor model
of nematic liquid crystals. In such a model, the energy is a degenerate functional of a tensor that must
satisfy a rank-one constraint a.e. in the physical domain. We proved the Γ-convergence of the discrete
energies as the mesh size tends to zero and developed an energy-decreasing gradient flow algorithm for the
computation of discrete solutions. The numerical experiments show that this method is capable of capturing
high-dimensional and non-orientable defect structures.
