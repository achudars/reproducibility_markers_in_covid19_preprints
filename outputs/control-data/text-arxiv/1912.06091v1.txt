Our work analyzes the potential of ion traps for the experimental simulation of non-equilibrium
phase transitions observed in certain spin-chain models which can be mapped to free-fermion systems. In order to make the dynamics more accessible to an experimenter, we first consider relatively
small systems, with few particles. We analyze phase transitions in the non-equilibrium asymptotic
regimes of an XY spin chain with a transverse magnetic field and coupled to Markovian baths
at the end sites. We study a static open system and a case when the spin chain is periodically
kicked. Notably, in the latter case for some anisotropy parameters the dependence on the system
size converges rapidly to the many-particle limit, thus facilitating the experimental observation of
the dynamics. We also define local observables that indicate the presence of the quantum phase
transitions of interest, and we study the effects of the long-range character of the typical interactions
obtained in ion traps.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions is a very active area of research (see, for example,
[1–6]). The inclusion of driving elements, non-thermal
baths, and/or baths at different temperatures leads to
rich phenomena going beyond the traditional quantum
phase transitions (QPTs), that is, transitions observed
in quantum systems at zero temperature and which take
place as a consequence of quantum rather than thermal
fluctuations [7]. The field of non-equilibrium QPTs has
seen in the last decades a huge progress in the possibilities of implementation of the dynamics in the setting
of controllable quantum systems provided by ultracold
atoms [8, 9], trapped ions [10, 11], NMR [12], or cavity
QED [13] to name a few.
A recent series of articles shows the presence of nonequilibrium phase-transitions in a particular model of
driven XY spin chains, which can be mapped to quadratic
open fermionic systems [14–16]. In this work we provide
an analysis of the feasibility of the implementation of this
kind of dynamics in a system of trapped ions. This implies the study of several key aspects: in the first place,
one must translate the elements of the original proposal
in terms of the dynamics of trapped ions. In this respect,
the area of quantum simulations in ion traps is very advanced and our proposal benefits from the resources already available in the literature. We do not elaborate
on this aspect since the tools to simulate spin systems
with ions are standard and described in detail elsewhere
[17, 18].
More importantly, it is necessary to identify the essential signatures of the phase transitions that are still
visible in chains with reduced numbers of particles; even
though some research groups have been able to perform quantum simulations with large numbers of particles [19, 20], most trapped-ion labs are able to manipulate
short chains only. Another difficulty is the fact that the
original models studied in [14–16] contain only nearestneighbour interactions, which is essential for the mapping

of the spin system to a fermionic model admitting an efficient analytical treatment. However, such short-ranged
interactions are very challenging for an experimenter. We
thus focus on power-law interactions, which are standard
in ion traps but give rise to spin models whose dynamics
are harder to calculate. Finally, it is important to define
measurable quantities that allow one to observe the phenomena of interest with a moderate number of resources
and in moderate time; again, the original models focus
on observables that greatly simplify the theoretical calculation but which are not straightforward to measure
in an actual implementation because of their non-local
character.
This work is organized as follows: In Section II we
shortly review the theoretical models of interest. Section
III describes the results obtained in the original models
when the numbers of chain sites are relatively small, and
discusses the convergence to the many-particle limit. Section IV analyzes modifications of the model in order to
make it closer to realistic experimental situations: firstly,
by changing the observable of interest in order to make it
more easily accessible to measurements, and secondly, by
considering the effect of long-range correlations. Finally,
in Section V we summarize our results. Further details
are provided in three appendices.

II. THE MODEL OF INTEREST: AN
OUT-OF-EQUILIBRIUM SPIN CHAIN

The starting point of our work is provided by two articles by Prosen and co-authors [14, 16]. In the first paper, a problem of an open and out-of-equilibrium spin
chain is presented which admits an exact solution of the
non-equilibrium steady state using quantization in the
space of operators (see the Appendix A and [14]). For
the steady state found, a quantum phase transition is
detected by studying long-range correlations. In the second work, a similar analysis is carried out in presence
of a time-dependent periodic driving [16]. The authors

2
found complex phase diagrams displaying phases of long
range and exponentially decaying spin-spin correlations
depending on the parameter values chosen. For the periodically kicked chain, the structure of this phase diagram was related with the stationary points of the Floquet quasiparticle dispersion relation.
The first model was the time-independent XY chain
of N spins 1/2 with transverse field, with Hamiltonian

with the curly brackets denoting the anticommutator. As
was shown in [21, 22], the Hamiltonian of the system can
be diagonalized by mapping the problem onto a system
of free fermions. In the extended model including the
coupling with baths at the ends, the Lindblad operators
are such that the problem in terms of fermions is still
solvable with a similar approach [23].

m∈Z (t − mτ ) is a periodic Dirac function with period τ , and a = hτ where h is the intensity of the external magnetic field. This system is also coupled to a pair
of Lindblad baths at its ends, defined in the same form
as in the previous, time-independent model.
In order to solve the problem, the system of N spins is
mapped by means of the Wigner-Jordan transformation
onto a model with N fermionic particles with creation
and annihilation operators c†j , cj respectively [21, 22]. In
this mapping, the spin projection along the z axis in site
j is directly related with the presence or absence of a
fermionic particle in this site, according to σjz ≡ 2c†j cj −1.
However, the spin projections along directions x and y
are mapped into non-local observables in terms of the
fermionic system. Alternatively, instead of working with

For the case of the kicked model, the correlations in
Eq. (8) are evaluated immediately after the kick. With
the goal of a possible implementation in mind, it is essential to notice that the correlators Cj,k are local in terms of
the fermionic model, but highly nonlocal with respect to
the original spin operators. This aspect will be analyzed
in Section IV.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS OF THE
ORIGINAL MODEL IN SMALL CHAINS

We now proceed to numerically study the behaviour
of this system in cases with few particles. We first consider the case of the time-independent non-equilibrium
system and then we move on to analyze the case of the
kicked chain. As was reported in Refs. [14, 16], for a
sufficiently large number N of sites, the main features
of the long-range correlation diagrams are no longer affected by the details of the baths at the ends. This is not
surprising since the strength of the coupling to the baths
is kept constant while the system is taken to the thermodynamic limit; thus, the critical behaviour observed
corresponds to the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics.
However, the presence of some kind of bath is essential
for the analysis since it is necessary in order to have a
well-defined asymptotic state. Furthermore, the convergence to this state is fastest when the couplings with the
baths are taken to be of the same order of magnitude as
the Hamiltonian parameters.
We focus our study on the feasibility of the implementation with small chains for several reasons: first of all,
most ion-trap labs in the world can only successfully control small systems. Secondly, the transitions are observed
in the asymptotic state, and the rate of convergence to

it decreases as the chains get longer. Finally, the number of observables that one needs to measure in order to
build the correlation diagram of Prosen and co-authors
increases with the number of sites in the chain (for more
details see Subsection IV A). Thus, implementations with
relatively long chains become extremely challenging. In
the following we show results concerning the behaviour
of the different models for an increasing value of N ; more
details are provided in Appendix C.
A.

Time-independent model

In order to study the feasibility of the experimental implementation of the first model, we analyze the behaviour
of the residual correlations (8) as a function of the parameters γ, h and observe the convergence to the limit
N ≫ 1. As an example, Figure 1 shows the residual corR

for different particle numbers, N = 5, 7, 10, and 17, while
the black line indicates the phase boundary in the thermodynamic limit. The results show that signatures of the
QPT appear for N & 15. For those values, Cres presents
an abrupt change which coincides with the theoretical
prediction hc = 1 − γ 2 [14].

i.e. the open chain with periodic kicks, for different values

with subplots (a-c) corresponding to N = 4, 7, 20. We
consider the cases γ = 0.1 and 0.9 as in [16], but we
prefer to use a − τ diagrams instead of h − τ diagrams as
in [16] to display more clearly the periodic dependence of
the phase diagram on a. This periodicity
is related with
P
z
σ
, which has a

period π2 and also produces a reflection with respect to
the axis a = π4 . Therefore, one can restrict the analysis
to the interval a ∈ [0, π4 ).
In panel (d) of Figs. 2 and 3, we show half the total number of non-trivial stationary points of the quasiparticle dispersion relation for the infinite kicked XY
chain (see Appendix B and [16]). The non-equilibrium
phase transitions correponding to the sudden appearance
of long-range correlations happen at points where the
number of stationary points presents jumps. Thus, this
quantity was found to determine the shape of the phase
diagram [16].
In the case with small anisotropy, γ = 0.1, shown in
Fig. 2, one can observe that small systems (N = 4 and
7, in the upper row) already display a structure which
resembles that of large chains, with a sharp onset of the
long-range correlations forming dark triangles on the left
of the diagram. On the contrary, for large anisotropy
parameters, γ = 0.9 as in Fig. 3, one has to reach much
larger particle numbers (N ≃ 20) in order to observe
a sudden appearance of long-range correlations at the
points where the number of stationary points exhibits a
jump (as displayed in subplot d). Besides, for γ = 0.1
the transition that is seen most clearly is the one for
the smallest values of τ . From these observations, in the

IV.

TOWARDS A REALISTIC EXPERIMENTAL
IMPLEMENTATION

We have previously shown that the time-independent
model for non-equilibrium phase transitions only displays
critical behaviour for relatively large chains with N & 15.
On the contrary, the model with periodic kicks and small
anisotropy already shows signatures of the phase diagram
for very small chains, with N & 5. For this reason, in the
following we will focus only on this second situation. For
definiteness, we will take the number of particles fixed at
N = 5.
We consider the possible implementation of the kicked
model for non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions using a chain of trapped ions. This setup has been proposed, and used, for spin simulations in several occasions
[10, 17, 18, 24, 25, 27]. In this context, the internal degrees of freedom of the ions encode the spins, while the
Coulomb interaction is used to generate effective spinspin interactions. In order to achieve this, ions are driven
by laser pulses which couple the internal states with the
vibrational motion of the ions. If the laser pulses are
chosen appropriately, an effective spin-spin interaction is
produced [17, 18]. We will now discuss how the original model of Prosen and coauthors can be made more
experimental-friendly by requiring measurements of local
observables, and after this we analyze the effects of the
long range of the typical effective interactions achieved

This quantity can be numerically computed from the
density matrix corresponding to the asymptotic state. In
Fig. 4 we compare local and non-local residual correlations for γ = 0.1. We observe that local residual correlations show the same structure as the correlations which
are local in terms of fermionic operators, although with a
different intensity (notice the change in the color scale).
We stress that the number of correlations that one
loc
needs to measure to obtain Cres
is much smaller than
the total number of observables necessary for full state
tomography. However, the amount of measurements reloc
quired to calculate Cres
still scales up as N 2 , which is another reason to prefer simulations that are feasible with
small chains. Furthermore, the necessary measurements
demand the ability to individually address and rotate
the desired spins. This is a non-trivial technical requirement, which also makes the experiment more challenging
for longer chains.

appropriately tuning the lasers [20, 24], and it has been
theoretically shown that the parameter α can be tuned in
the range between α = 0 and α = 3 [17]. Experimentally,
tuning of α from 0.01 to 2.72 has been demonstrated [20].
However, interactions in the highest range of values of α
are hard to achieve experimentally because the large detunings required lead to low coupling strengths, and thus
most experiments have been performed with intermediate values of α [20, 24, 26, 27].
Thus, we now analyze the simulation of our model
of non-equilibrium phase transitions in the kicked spin
chain but where the spin-spin interactions are given by
the Hamiltonian:

= 1+γ
2 and Jj,j+1 =
1−γ
2 . Considering this Hamiltonian and the term associated with the periodic kick we evaluated once more the
residual correlations in the asymptotic regime. We note
that this is numerically more costly, since in presence of
long-term couplings the Jordan-Wigner transformation
does not lead to a quadratic fermionic system any more.
This means that a compact description of the dynamics
is not possible. However, the full computation is still
feasible due to the small number of particles.
In Fig. 5 we show the results for the local residual

correlation Cres
with γ = 0.1 including the power-law
decay of interactions, with powers α = 3 (a) and α = 2
(b). Both cases are theoretically possible [17]; however,
case (a), which is closest to the original model, corresponds to a limiting case of infinite laser detuning. Case
(b), on the contrary, is within the range which has been
experimentally demonstrated [20]. We observe that the
structure of the diagram is similar to the previous Figures, although the new interaction terms affect the reflection symmetry of the correlation with respect to the
axis a = π/4. Clearly, the deformation is much more

that the reflection symmetry with respect to the axis a = π/4
is broken; however, this effect is small and the diagram still
shows a sudden appearance of correlations in coincidence with

chosen; panel (b) shows the results for the more realistic power

lower intensity contrast. Thus, it seems worth pushing
the interaction power law to the highest possible values
(α = 2.72 being the fastest decay achieved so far [20]);
nevertheless, the qualitative features of the diagram are
still clearly visible for the case α = 2.

V.

CONCLUSIONS

We have critically assessed the potential for the iontrap implementation of the models proposed by Prosen
[14, 16] displaying non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions in spin chains. We analyzed the effects of several
key aspects: in the first place, the possibility to observe
signatures of the phase transitions in chains with small
numbers of particles. There, we observed that the number of sites required depends on the precise model under
consideration: for the static model numbers N & 15 are
necessary to identify the position of the critical line, while
for the kicked model the number depends strongly on the
anisotropy parameter γ. For γ = 0.9, the shape of the
long-range correlation diagram only starts ressembling
the right critical structure with relatively large numbers,
N & 20, whereas a small anisotropy γ = 0.1 leads to a
diagram displaying the expected onset of long-range correlations with a number of sites N & 5. In order to make
the necessary number of sites as small as possible, we
chose to focus on the case γ = 0.1 with small τ .
In a following step, we redefined the original indicator
of the presence of long-range correlations in order to make
it more experimentally accessible. This meant replacing
a quantity which was obtained from local measurements
in terms of the fermionic model, and thus nonlocal in the
experiment, by one which was defined from observables
which are local in terms of the spin operators. We then

6
concluded that the structure of the diagram was still visible when performing this kind of measurement, although
the intensity pattern varied with respect to the original
results.
Finally, we considered the effect of the presence of longrange interactions in the experimentally feasible ion-trap
simulations. We assumed that the effective spin-spin interactions had a power-law decay, and computed the resulting correlation diagrams for powers α = 3 and α = 2.
While the long-range interactions partially destroyed one
of the symmetries of the original model, one could still
observe transitions between regimes with and without
long-range correlations. We thus conclude that although

the exact features of the original article [16] are not preserved in a realistic implementation, the markers of the
transitions are still visible in experimentally achievable
conditions.

On the other hand, when the evolution equations are
time-dependent, the covariance matrix C satisfies
Ċ(t) = −X(t)C(t) − C(t)XT (t) + iY(t)

with X(t) and Y(t) defined as before but from the timedependent H and M. The solution to eq. (A6) can be
written as [16]

We review here the formulation used by Prosen for
quadratic systems with a bath with linear terms [15, 16].
The aim of this formulation is to calculate the correlations avoiding the calculation of the density matrix, and
it is a generalization of the standard description of Gaussian states by means of the covariance matrix [28]. This
approach has considerable advantages, leading to a substantial decrease of computational costs in cases when a
full analytical solution is not possible. Within this formalism, correlations are obtained by solving a Lyapunov
equation, for which there are fast computational solving
softwares.
The formulation is performed in terms of the Majorana
operators. The authors consider a system of fermions described by 2N anticonmmuting Hermitean operators ωj ,
j = 1, ..., 2N , {ωj , ωk } = 2δj,k . One can define Majorana
operators in terms of Pauli matrices on N sites as

The authors consider systems for which both the Hamiltonian H and the Lindblad operators L can be simultaneously expressed in terms of a quadratic form and linear
forms respectively. In this representation

where H can be chosen to be antisymmetric and imaginary, and ℓµ ∈ C2N .
The object of interest is the correlation matrix C with
elements Cj,k defined as:
Cj,k = tr (ωj ωk ρ) − δj,k

(A4)

If the equations for the evolution of the system do not
depend on time, one can obtain the elements of C in
the stationary state through the continuous Lyapunov
equation [15]:

XC + CX = iY .

with the initial conditions Q(0) = I, P(0) = 0.
In the case studied in [16], the temporal dependence
of the problem is through a periodic kick in the Hamiltonian, so that L(t + τ ) = L(t), where τ is the period.
The correlation matrix for the stationary state is then
obtained solving the discrete Lyapunov equation
Q(τ )CF QT (τ ) − CF = iP(τ )QT (τ ),

(A10)

where C(0) = C(τ ) = CF .
Appendix B: Quasi-energy bands of the kicked
system

In Ref. [16], analyzing the kicked system, it was shown
that, when dealing with many particles, the main properties of the residual correlations depend essentially on the
Hamiltonian of the bulk. For this reason, the dispersion
relation of a kicked XY infinite chain was studied. The
system has two quasi-energy bands of the form:
n
θ1,2 (κ) = ±arcos cos (2τ h) cos [2τ ε(κ)]
cos(κ) o
+ sin (2τ h) sin [2τ ε(κ)]
(B1)
ε(κ)
q
where ε(κ) = cos2 (κ) + γ 2 sin2 (κ) is the quasi-particle
energy for the unkicked XY chain, κ ∈ [ −π, π ). As discussed in Refs. [15, 16] the jumps in the residual correlations Cres coincide with jumps in the number of nontrivial stationary points of the quasienergies dispersion
relation of the Floquet eigenstates of the system. As
the total number of stationary points is always even, the
quantity shown in the plots in the main text is half this
number.
Appendix C: Dependence of the residual
correlations on the number of sites

In this Appendix we provide further plots showing
the behaviour of the residual correlation Cres , defined
in Eq. (8), as the number of sites is increased. In Fig. 6

8
we plot the residual correlation for different values of N .
Plot (a) corresponds to the static case as a function of γ,
with h = 0.75, whereas plots (b) and (c) correspond to
the kicked model and show Cres as a function of τ , with
a = 1.25, for γ = 0.1 and 0.9 respectively. One can see
that in plots (a) and (c) a number of sites N around 20 is
necessary to observe the signatures of the transition. On
the contrary, plot (b) indicates that for small anisotropy,
γ = 0.1, the transition at smallest τ is already visible
with less than 10 sites.
