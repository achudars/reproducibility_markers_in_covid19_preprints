Abstract
We show that the scalar field of mimetic gravity could be used to construct
diffeomorphism invariant models that reduce to Hořava gravity in the synchronous gauge. The gradient of the mimetic field provides a timelike unit
vector field that allows to define a projection operator of four-dimensional
tensors to three-dimensional spatial tensors. Conversely, it also enables us
to write quantities invariant under space diffeomorphisms in fully covariant
form without the need to introduce new propagating degrees of freedom.

It has been recognized for some time that in order to improve the UV
behaviour of the graviton propagator and, thus, the renormalizability of gravity, it is necessary to add higher spatial derivatives to its Lagrangian but no
higher time derivatives. Because this seems to contradict the relativistic
local Lorentz invariance, it was thought necessary to break the symmetry
between space and time. The most notable attempt is the one by Hořava [9],
who constructed a model of quantum gravity with explicitly broken Lorentz
symmetry, which allowed him to add to the action terms dependent on the
spatial Ricci tensor and curvature scalar and their space derivatives (see e.g.
[10] and references therein). This is a high price to pay because, although
the Hořava model is renormalizable when projected into the product space
R × Σ3 , this property is lost when the model is made covariant by adding one
new field [6]. Various attempts were made to keep renormalizability of the
models while restoring Lorentz invariance by adding a dynamical scalar or
vector [8]. Such models exhibit additional propagating degrees of freedom,
which limited their acceptance as a solution to the problem of renormalizability of gravity.
Mimetic gravity was proposed as a way of separating the scale factor from
the metric and resulted in reproducing Einstein gravity in addition to half
a degree of freedom which could be used to mimic dark matter [1]. The
main observation is that one can define the metric tensor gµν in terms of an
auxiliary metric e
gµν by the relation

gµν = e
gµν e
g κλ∂κ φ∂λ φ ,
(1)
where φ is a scalar field. The metric gµν is invariant under the scale transformation e
gµν → Ω2 e
gµν and, as can be easily shown, satisfies the constraint
g µν ∂µ φ∂ν φ = 1,

(2)

governing the evolution of φ. Thus, instead of introducing the mimetic field φ
through the reparametrization (1), it is easier to consider directly the physical
metric gµν together with a constrained scalar field, enforcing (2) through a
Lagrange multiplier [2]. This implies that out of the 11 variables gµν and φ
there are only 10 independent fields. In the ADM decomposition of gµν ,


ds2 = N 2 dt2 − γij dxi + N i dt dxj + N j dt ,
i = 1, 2, 3
(3)

where N is the lapse function, N i is the shift vector, and γij = −gij is the
metric on the spatial 3d hypersurface, the constraint (2) can be solved for N
1

in terms of the 10 variables Ni , γij and φ, yielding
2

(∂0 φ − N i ∂i φ)
N =

(1 + γ ij ∂i φ∂j φ)

(4)

In the synchronous gauge N = 1, Ni = 0, a solution of (2) is given by
φ = t + A,

(5)

where A is a constant. Since there exists a whole family of synchronous
coordinate systems, corresponding to the freedom of choice of an initial hypersurface of constant time, this solution is not unique. On the other hand,
φ can always be used as one particular synchronous time coordinate, fixing
a unique 3 + 1 slicing that we will use from now on. The timelike unit vector nµ = ∂µ φ points in this time direction. In particular, we can define the
projection operator
Pµν = δµν − ∂µ φ∂κ φg νκ ,
(6)
satisfying the relations
Pµρ Pρν = Pµν ,

Pµν ∂ν φ = 0.

(7)

In the synchronous slicing from above we have
P00 = 0,

Pi0 = 0,

P0i = 0,

Pij = δij ,

(8)

showing that Pµν projects space-time vectors to space vectors. It is then
clear that in mimetic gravity, using the projection operator and the vector
nµ = ∂µ φ, it is possible to construct four-dimensional tensors whose only
non-zero components in the synchronous gauge are along space directions.
For example, as we will show in the following, the expression
e := 2Rµν ∂µ φ∂ν φ − R − (φ)2 + ∇µ ∇ν φ∇µ ∇ν φ
R

(9)

coincides with the spatial curvature scalar 3R of synchronous slices.
In previous works we have shown that in mimetic gravity, without the
need to introduce any additional fields, we can build cosmological models [3]
and solve the singularity problem for Friedmann, Kasner [4] and Black hole
[5] solutions by using the idea of limiting curvature. More recently we have
shown that the idea of asymptotic freedom can be implemented in mimetic
2

gravity by introducing a φ dependent effective gravitational constant which
vanishes at the limiting curvature [11]. Moreover, it was shown that such a
dependence does not introduce higher time derivatives.
The purpose of this letter is to show that within mimetic gravity we
can construct all the terms needed in Hořava gravity using four-dimensional
tensors that reduce to the desired form in the synchronous gauge. We will
thus show that in mimetic gravity it is possible to formulate Hořava gravity
in a diffeomorphism invariant way without introducing ghost-like degrees of
freedom.
The basic fields that appear in Hořava gravity are the three-dimensional
tensors and scalars κij , κ, 3Rij , 3R, Dk 3Rij , and their contractions needed to
form space diffeomorphism invariant expressions. The extrinsic curvature of
the synchronous slices φ = const. is given by
1
√
κij = γ̇ij ,
κji = γ jl κil ,
κ = κii = (ln γ)· ,
(10)
2
where dot denotes t derivative and γ is the metric determinant. Using φ, it
can be expressed covariantly as
∇i ∇j φ = −κij ,

∇i ∇j φ = κji ,

φ = κ.

The non-vanishing components of the four-dimensional Riemann tensor are
determined by

where Di and 3Rlkij are the covariant derivative and the Riemann tensor
belonging to the metric γij . With the help of the above identities, we can
construct the four-dimensional tensor

whose only non-zero components are 3Rlkij in the synchronous gauge. Next,
we compute the Ricci tensor components
.

R00 = −κ − κij κij

R0i = Dl κli − Di κ
Rij = 3Rij + κκij − κni κnj + R0i0j .

These relations allow us to define the tensor
eµν := Pµα Pνβ Rαβ + φ∇µ ∇ν φ − ∇µ ∇ρ φ∇ν ∇ρ φ − Rγ ∇δ φ∇γ φ,
R

(19)

whose non-zero components coincide with 3Rij in the synchronous gauge.
Contracting with g µν , we arrive at (9).
√ 
We note in passing that the total derivative √1γ ∂0
γκ can be easily
eliminated from the Lagrangian of Einstein-Hilbert gravity, leaving us with
e
− R − 2∇µ (φ∇µ φ) = ∇µ ∇ν φ∇µ ∇ν φ − (φ)2 + R.

(20)

For manifolds with boundary ∂M = {φ = φi } ∪ {φ = φf } consisting of closed
spatial hypersurfaces of constant φ, this has precisely the same effect as
adding the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term.
Space derivatives of the above tensors can be obtained by applying the

operator Pµρ ∇ρ . Note that the spatial components of Pργ ∇γ R

must project all four-dimensional indices, i.e. one has to use Pργ Pµα Pνβ ∇γ R
Thus, we can now define the analogue of the three-dimensional Cotton tensor

whose only non-vanishing components in the synchronous gauge are 3 Cji .
Another object that could be constructed is the Chern-Simons three form
ωP related to the Pontryagin topological invariant
Rσρ ∧ Rρσ = dωP ,

(23)

ωP = Γνµ ∧ dΓµν +

(24)

where Γνµ = dxρ Γνρµ and Rσρ = 21 Rσρµν dxµ ∧ dxν are the Christoffel connection
one-form and the curvature two form, respectively. The four-form dφ ∧ ωP
is not parity invariant. Up to a boundary term, its integral is given by
Z
Z
dφ ∧ ωP = − φ Rσρ ∧ Rρσ .

This shows that such a contribution to the action is covariant and invariant
under global shifts of φ. In the synchronous gauge the integrand reduces to

(28)
which coincides in the synchronous gauge with

Thus, the purely three-dimensional Chern-Simons form can be incorporated
in the action by adding the term

(30)
All of these manipulations illustrate that any expression invariant under
spatial diffeomorphisms can be written as a combination of four-dimensional
tensors that reduces to it in the synchronous gauge.
We conclude by writing an exemplary Hořava action in mimetic gravity,
in terms of four-dimensional tensors and thus completely preserving diffeomorphism invariance, without the need for new degrees of freedom:

where η µνρσ = √1−g ǫµνρσ . The case where c1 = c2 = 1 and all other couplings
vanish is just a rewritten form of General Relativity with mimetic matter.
The constants c1 , . . . , c7 could also be taken as functions of φ in such a way
as to reproduce General Relativity in the low curvature limit.

There is no need to repeat calculations done for the Hořava models, as
those could be thought of as a gauge fixed version of a diffeomorphism invariant theory in the synchronous gauge.
In the projectable Hořava models, the lapse function N is assumed to
depend on time only, N = N (t) . These models coincide with the above
family of actions in the synchronous gauge. Their renormalization analysis
was carried out in references [6], [7], where they were shown to be renormalizable. When the same analysis was applied to the non-projectable case
where the lapse function is N = N (xi , t), so that terms dependent on the
iN
vector ai = ∂N
can occur, it was found that these models become nonrenormalizable. Attempts were made to construct diffeomorphism invariant
Hořava models by adding a unit vector field uµ , subject to the hypersurface
orthogonality condition u[µ ∇ν u ρ] = 0. These models, however, have a spin-1
and spin-0 degree of freedom in addition to the graviton.
The synchronous gauge belongs to the family of temporal gauge, which
for fluctuations of the metric takes the form nµ hµν = 0, where gµν = ηµν +hµν
and nµ = (1, 0, 0, 0) . The main advantage of working in this gauge is that
the model proposed above will be power counting renormalizable and that
the ghosts associated with gauge fixing will decouple from the physical Smatrix. The disadvantage is the need to have an unambiguous prescription
for the unphysical singularities of the form (q.n)−α , α = 1, 2 (cf. [12]) and the
difficulty in performing higher loop calculations. It is a challenging problem
to perform a detailed analysis of the renormalization program, either in the
synchronous gauge or in a covariant gauge, using the background field method
and integrating out the mimetic constraint, along the lines of [6]. Even
though an actual proof could be quite demanding, we expect the mimetic
Hořava model presented here to be renormalizable.
