Swampland conjectures are a set of proposed necessary conditions for a low-energy effective
field theory to have a UV completion inside a theory of quantum gravity. Swampland conjectures have interesting phenomenological consequences, and conversely phenomenological
considerations are useful guidelines in sharping our understanding of quantum gravity.

Swampland Conjectures

During the Moriond electroweak session we have seen many examples of fruitful interplays between theory and experiment—theorists try to explain experimental findings, while experimentalists turn to theorists for useful guidelines for what to look for.
From a theorist’s viewpoint, coming up a “theory” often involves picking up a certain lowenergy quantum field theory (QFT). One can then discuss experimental constraints on the
parameters of the theory, possible new signatures predicted by the theory, and so on. The big
problem, however, is that there are tremendous numbers of possible quantum field theories you
can write down, and hence one has to face with huge numbers of possibilities.
One might therefore wish that there are new ingredients in theorist’s toolkit. I am going
to argue that such a new tool comes from quantum gravity, albeit in somewhat unconventional
forms (Fig. 1).

Figure 1 – A phenomenologist often comes up with a specific low-energy QFT and works out its experimental
consequences. It is often not clear, however, which QFT one should start with, since there are simply too many
possibilities. If one starts with quantum gravity, one sometimes finds good evidence that certain low-energy
QFTs are not possible. This is the content of the swampland conjectures. Such conjectures help to narrow down
possibilities, and could reduce the the difficult job of a “low-energy” phenomenologist.

Quantum gravity in itself is typically believed to be located at an extremely high energy
scale. We can, however, ask whether or not a given low-energy effective field theories can be
reproduced from a theory of quantum gravity.

Contribution to the proceedings for the 2019 EW session of the 54th “Rencontres de Moriond”. The slides for
the talk are available from http://member.ipmu.jp/masahito.yamazaki/files/2019/Moriond_2019.pdf. In the
original version of this note I stated “Since this proceeding is limited to strictly 6 pages with references included,
we will not have space to list all the relevant references.” In the revised version some more references have been
added, but I would still encourage interested readers to refer to the INSPIRE-HEP database for a complete list.

Traditionally, this involves a specific string theory setup—this can be heterotic string theory
on Calabi-Yau three-fold, F-theory on elliptically-fibered Calabi-Yau four-fold, M-theory on G2
holonomy manifolds, etc. By contrast we are asking a more universal question, at least in spirit:
does the low-energy effective field theory have a UV completion in quantum gravity? If the
answer is yes, we say that the theory is in the landscape, while if no we say that the theory is in
the swampland. [1,2] In this terminology (by C. Vafa), if you are a “low-energy” phenomenologist
you need to make sure that your favorite theory is in the landscape, and not in the swampland.

Figure 2 – Inside the space of possible low-energy QFTs, some are realized by specific string theory constructions,
such as Calabi-Yau three-fold compactifications of the Heterotic theory. The consequences from these specific
constructions, may well be setup-dependent, and might not be obeyed in other string theory constructions. In
the swampland conjectures, by contrast, one tries to formulate universal consequences from the existence of UV
completion with gravity. If such conjectures are true, that has some interesting implications to low-energy model
building. There are indications that the constraints from swampland conjectures are so strong that “landscape”
is actually tiny inside the space of all possible low-energy QFTs.

One might ask “isn’t quantum gravity notoriously difficult”? For proper treatment of quantum gravity, you have to wait for your quantum gravity colleagues to solve it, and as of this
writing there is no indication that this will happen in anytime soon. Does this mean that you
can forget about this altogether?
Despite the lack of full understanding of quantum gravity, we do have some useful clues
about quantum gravity. First, we know about semiclassical description of black holes, such as
that black holes have Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, that black holes evaporate with Hawking
radiation. [3] We can devise many gedanken-experiments on black holes, and think about the
consequences, loopholes, and so on. Second, there are many examples/data from string theory,b
e.g. results based on a specific class of compactification manifolds.
The way to proceed is look at various data available, and formulate swampland conjectures,
a set of necessary conditions for the existence of UV completion. Once we formulate these
conjectures, we can set these conjectures by looking many more examples, this often leads to
quantitative tests. We can also try to verify the mutual consistency between different conjectures.
There are many swampland conjectures in the market, indeed too many to be listed here and
readers are referred to comprehensive reviews. [4, 5] Here, to illustrate the idea let me mention
one particular conjecture by M. Reece [6] (see Hebecker et al. [7] for a closely related work).
b

String theory is a rather promising theory of quantum gravity, and makes it possible to do many quantitative
computations, thus providing invaluable data for swampland constraints. For this reason we often use string
theory in swampland discussions. One should note, however, that the arguments from semiclassical black holes,
as mentioned previously, are independent of string theory. Consistency between black-hole-inspired conjectures
and string-theory-inspired conjectures have also been discussed.

Consider a U (1) gauge field A, namely a photon, with Suückelberg mass m.c Let us denote
the gauge coupling constant by e. Then the conjecture states that the UV-cutoff ΛUV of the
theory should satisfy the inequality



(1)
ΛUV . min (mMPl /e) 2 , e 3 MPl .
This places interesting constraints on light dark photons, [6]; note scenarios involving such light
dark photons were discussed during the Moriond conference.d
This conjecture is motivated by many other swampland conjectures, in particular the distance conjecture [2, 9] and the weak gravity conjecture [10], where the latter is an upgrade of
the old conjecture that there is no global symmetry in quantum gravity. [11–14] In this respect,
the conjecture (1) is an excellent example for an outcome from interrelations between several
different approaches to the swampland program.

De Sitter Swampland Conjecture

While the swampland program by now has history of more than 10 years, recently there has
been renewal of interest in this topic. One of the reasons for this is the paper [15] on the “de
Sitter swampland conjecture” (hereafter dS conjecture) in June 2018. This paper immediately
generated interest and and controversies in the community.
The dS conjecture states that the total scalar potential V of any effective field theorye satisfies
an inequality
MPl |∇V | ≥ c V .

(2)

Here MPl ≃ 2 × 1018 GeV is the Planck scale, c is an O(1) positive constant.
After the proposal of the conjecture, problems of this conjecture has been pointed out—the
dS conjecture excludes local maximum with positive energy
∇2 V < 0 ,

∇V = 0 ,

V >0.

(3)

Such local maximum, however, clearly exists in the potential of the Higgs field, and of the
axion [16–18] (if an axion exists).
This in itself does not exclude the dS conjecture, since one can think of various loopholes—for
example, we can enlarge the field space by coupling the Higgs/axion to the quintessence field.
However, after several independent analysis (involving many fun ingredients, such as no-go
theorem for electroweak modification, fifth-force constraints, etc.), one comes to the conclusion
that most such loopholes can be eliminated, except for some rather exotic scenarios. [19–22]
In view of these results, a number of refinements of the dS conjecture have been proposed.
[20, 23–27] For example, one possible modification [25, 26] states that
MPl |∇V | ≥ c V

or

min(∇2 V ) ≤ −c′ V ,

(4)

where c and c′ are O(1) positive constants. This is slightly stronger than the another conjecture,
[20] which corresponds to the special value c′ = 0 of the conjecture above. We here call these
conjectures the refined de Sitter conjectures (hereafter RdS conjectures).
While the RdS conjectures evades the problems with the local maxima of the Higgs or axion
potential, they still have an important consequence—the conjectures forbid the stable de Sitter
vacua:
∇V = 0

,

∇2 V > 0 ,

V >0.

(5)

This is a gauge-invariant mass of the form L ⊃ m2 (Aµ − ∂µ θ)2 for a scalar field θ, with gauge transformation
δAµ = ∂µ χ, δθ = χ.
d
See, however, Craig et al. [8] for discussion on possible loopholes.
e
We choose canonical normalization for scalar fields. We assume there are only finitely many scalar fields in
the Lagrangian.
c

This conjecture is therefore tension with the literature (e.g. KKLT scenario [28]) for de
Sitter vacua in string theory (see also recent articles [29–31]). It seems fair to say that the RdS
conjectures are speculative, at least as general statements, and might hold only in the asymptotic
region of the moduli space where we have parametric control.f In the following we will assume
the RdS conjectures and work out the consequences. This will lead us to interesting scenarios,
and in my opinion it is of value to explore these possibilities, irrespective of the validity of the
RdS conjectures—ultimately the finally verdict is up to the Nature.
2.1

Dark Energy

If RdS conjectures are correct, dark energy cannot be the cosmological constant. One possibility
is then to consider a dynamical scalar field, the quintessence. [34–36]
There are enormous challenges in quintessence model building. First of all, the quintessence
potential should be extremely flat, to avoid rapid change of the size of the dark energy. Second,
the potential in itself should have a correct size to explain the present-day energy scale of dark
4 ≪ M4 .
energy Λ4 ≃ 10−120 MPl
Pl
In our recent paper [37], we looked into the possibility of the electroweak quintessence
axion, where the quintessence is the axion field [38–40] for the electroweak SU (2) gauge group.
[38, 41, 42]g
If such an electroweak axion exists, it can explain the flatness of the potential since the
shift symmetry of the axion is broken only by non-perturbative instanton effects. Moreover,
the energy scale of the axion potential is given by the dynamical scale, which is estimated to
be [41, 42]
2π
2 (MPl )

−α

e
Λ4 = MPl

4
,
≃ 10−130 MPl

(6)

where we use the value of the electroweak coupling constant α2 = g22 /(4π) at the Planck scale.
This is very close to the present-day scale of the dark energy. Since the axions are often generated
by string theory, one hope such electroweak quintessence axions arise from string theory, and
further motivations for the existence of such axion are provided by the RdS conjectures. [37, 67]
Of course, irrespective of the validity of the RdS conjectures, the existence of the quintessence
can be probed by observation, from the measurement of the equation-of-state parameter w = p/ρ
for various values of redshift. While the current results show no sign of deviation from w = −1,
[68] it is important to continue observational searches in higher precision.
2.2

Inflation

What are the consequences of the RdS conjecture for the early universe, namely inflation?
If we insist on the two O(1) parameters c, c′ in Eq. (4) to be c, c′ ∼ 1 (and not c, c′ ∼ 0.01, for
example), then we found [69] that the simplest type of inflationary models, namely single-field
inflationary models with canonical kinetic terms, can generate inflation with sufficient number
of e-foldings, but have trouble reproducing the observed value [70] of the spectral index.h The
problem can be evaded in multi-field inflationary models, e.g. by the curvaton scenario. [77–80]
This could lead to interesting signatures, such as primordial non-Gaussianities, [81] which can
be tested in future improved observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
f

It would be interesting to fully justify the RdS conjectures even in such weakly-coupled regions of the parameter space (there has recently been attempts in this direction [25, 32]; note that the classic argument by Dine and
Seiberg [33] in itself does not automatically guarantee this). As we emphasized before, the point of the swampland
conjectures is to work out the consequences which holds irrespective of specific string theory setups, and even the
“weakly-coupled RdS conjecture” is universal in this sense.
g
See e.g. [30, 37, 43–66] for other recent discussion of quintessence and swampland conjectures.
h
Note that this conclusion is different from earlier papers (see e.g. [24, 71–76]) which discussed the consequences of the condition (2) (as opposed to the refined version (4))—under (2) single-field inflationary models
with canonical kinetic terms have trouble generating a sufficient number of e-foldings.

Summary

In this paper we have introduced the swampland program, which is an attempt to extract
universal consequences of quantum gravity in low-energy effective field theory. The swampland
conjectures, if correct, have many implications to physics in vastly different energy scales, ranging
from the energy scale of dark energy all the way up to the energy scale of inflation. Conversely, we
have presented examples where the bottom-up phenomenological constraints affect the on-going
discussion about swampland conjectures.

Figure 3 – While quantum gravity in itself might be associated with very high energy scale (such as the Planck
scale), swampland conjectures originating from quantum gravity have implications phenomena in vastly different
energy scales, as explained in this paper.

In this sense, the search for quantum gravity is tied with the study of “low-energy physics”,
either in theory and experiment (as expressed in Fig. 1). In order to “make sure that no stones
are left unturned”i , swampland program is a useful approach to keep in mind for any particle
phenomenologist and cosmologist.
