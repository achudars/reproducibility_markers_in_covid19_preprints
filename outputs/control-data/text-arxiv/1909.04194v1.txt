The electrical conductivity induced near the superconducting transition by thermal fluctuations
was measured in different granular aluminum films. The seemingly anomalous behavior at high
reduced temperatures and magnetic fields is explained by taking into account a total-energy cutoff
in the superconducting fluctuation spectrum in both the direct (Aslamazov-Larkin) and the indirect
(anomalous Maki-Thompson) contributions to the fluctuation effects. The analysis allowed a reliable
determination of the coherence length amplitudes, which resulted to be much larger (20 − 48 nm)
than the grains size (5 − 10 nm). This suggests that the grains are strongly Josephson-coupled,
while the Tc value is still as high as twice the bulk value. These results could contribute to identify
the mechanisms enhancing Tc in these materials.

I.

INTRODUCTION

As summarized in Tinkham’s textbook on
superconductivity1 (see also Ref. 2), the increase
just above Tc of the electrical conductivity relative to
the normal-state contribution (the so-called paraconductivity, ∆σ) is explained in low-Tc superconductors
(LTSC) by taking into account two contributions: a
direct (Aslamazov-Larkin, AL) contribution, due to
Cooper pairs created by thermal agitation, and the
indirect (Maki-Thompson, MT) contribution, associated with the quasiparticles created by the decay of
these fluctuating pairs. However, this scenario does
not explain the steep ∆σ reduction at high reduced> 0.1, or magnetic fields,
temperatures, ε ≡ ln(T /Tc ) ∼
<
h ≡ H/Hc2 (0) ∼ 1, Hc2 (0) being the upper critical field
linearly extrapolated to T = 0 K.3 These difficulties
are not completely overcome with the introduction of
a momentum (or kinetic-energy) cutoff to eliminate
the contribution of short-wavelength fluctuations.1,2,4,5
Alternative scenarios to explain this behavior have been
proposed, particularly for the highly studied granular
LTSC films, in terms of the reduction of the fluctuations
dimensionality, in turn associated with the decoupling
of superconducting grains or to a confinement due
to electronic inhomogeneities.6–8 Nevertheless, some
central aspects, as for instance the role that may play
the presence of MT contributions, still remain not well
settled.
To address the long standing open problem of the ∆σ
behavior at high-ε and -h in LTSC, in this work we first
present detailed ∆σ(T, H) measurements around Tc in
disordered aluminum films. Then, these data are quantitatively explained, also in the high-ε and -h regions,
by introducing in the AL and the anomalous MT contributions the so-called total-energy cutoff, that takes
into account the limits imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to the shrinkage of the superconduct-

ing wavefunction.9,10 The adequacy of this total-energy
cutoff to explain the fluctuation-induced (Schmidt) diamagnetism at high-ε and h in several LTSC has been
probed previously.11–14
The choice of thin (10−100 nm thick) granular Al films
is motivated by their experimental advantages: i) They
present a very well defined Tc that minimizes the entanglement between the intrinsic resistivity rounding due to
fluctuations and the extrinsic one associated with a possible Tc distribution, mainly near the average Tc .15 ii) For
temperatures above ∼ 3Tc the resistivity is almost T - and
H-independent, allowing a reliable determination of the
normal-state background. iii) The films properties are
determined by the ratio of Al evaporation rate to oxygen
pressure and the substrate temperature during evaporation, both of which are easily controlled. As compared
to clean systems, their properties are much less dependent on other conditions. Moreover, their superconducting properties present a remarkable correlation with the
normal state resistivity.16 The interest of the ∆σ studies
in granular Al films is also enhanced by their implications
in other aspects of these superconductors, including the
Nernst effect above Tc ,17 and the understanding of the
mechanisms that enhance their Tc , a fundamental problem still open.8

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The films were grown by thermal evaporation of aluminum on 5 × 5 mm2 thermally oxidized Si substrates at
room temperature in a 1 − 1.5 × 10−5 mbar oxygen pressure. The evaporation rate (0.2 nm/s) was monitored
with a quartz balance. The films’ microstructure was
investigated with a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss
FE-SEM Ultra Plus). As it may be seen in Fig. 1, due to
the presence of oxygen in the chamber during the evaporation process, they present a granular structure with

2
The resistivity, ρ, was measured with a commercial
Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum Design) by using an in-line contacts configuration with an
excitation current of 5 µA, and under perpendicular magnetic fields up to ∼ 0.5 T (large enough to almost quench
fluctuation effects above Tc ).

DATA ANALYSIS

For the sake of clarity this Section focuses on the data
for film A. The results for the the other studied films (B
and C), that are consistent with the ones for film A, are
presented in detail in the Appendix.

grain diameters in the 5-10 nm range. In the case of
films A and B the nominal thickness is 10 nm and the
substrate is essentially covered by a single layer of grains,
while in the case of film C (100 nm thickness) they form
three-dimensional agglomerates. A summary of the different characteristics of the samples used in this study is
presented in Table I.

Analysis of ∆σ for H = 0 in terms of the
conventional AL and MT approaches

The ρ(T, H) behavior around the superconducting
transition is presented in Fig. 2. The Tc value (2.07 K)
was estimated as the temperature at which the resistivity
falls to 50% the normal-state background, and the transition width, estimated as ∆T = Tc − T (ρ = 0), is only ∼
0.02 K. Tc is two times larger than in bulk Al,18 an effect
early attributed to different finite-size effects,19–24 and
that may be strongly affected by the degree of Josephson
coupling between neighboring grains.8,25 The maximum
Tc value observed in granular Al films is ∼ 3 K,8,18 so the
appreciable resistivity rounding extending up to ∼ 6 K
(see the inset of Fig. 2) can only be attributed to fluctuations. Moreover, as we will see below, the coherence
length amplitudes of the films studied in this work are
much larger than the grains average diameter (see Table
I). This prevents the appearance of a Tc distribution due
to the different grain sizes, and of the associated percolative effects near the average Tc . The homogeneous
nature of these materials is also supported by the fact
that the energy gaps determined from tunneling experiments in similar granular Al films present no detectable
broadening in spite of the grains size distribution.20
The paraconductivity was obtained from the data in
Fig. 2 through ∆σ(T ) = 1/ρ(T ) − 1/ρB (T ), where the
almost constant background resistivity ρB (T ) (solid line)
was obtained for each applied field by a linear fit to data
above 8 K. The ∆σ dependence on the reduced temperature for H = 0 is presented in Fig. 3 in a log-log
scale. The dot-dashed line is the AL prediction for twodimensional (2D) superconductors, given by,1,2

that may be corrected through the introduction of a cutoff in the energy of the fluctuation modes.9 In what follows, this procedure will be applied to the calculus of

Generalization of ∆σAL to high-ε and -h

A total-energy cutoff was used in Ref. 28 to extend
3D
the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) expression for ∆σAL
to the
high-ε and -h regions. The same procedure may be used
2D
to derive ∆σAL
, just by taking into account that for 2Dmaterials the spectrum of the fluctuations is frustrated
along the perpendicular direction (the corresponding
component of the fluctuations wavevector, qz is bounded
by −π/d and π/d, and verifies ξ(0)qz ≪ 1). When applied to Eqs. (B.17) and (B.18) of Ref. 28, this leads to29

FIG. 3. (Color online) ε-dependence of ∆σ for H = 0. The
dot-dashed line is the prediction of the 2D-AL approach.
The agreement is improved by including the MT contribution (dashed line) but only at low ε. The introduction of a
total energy cutoff (solid line) extends the applicability to the
high-ε region. For comparison, the slope −2 corresponding to
0D fluctuations is indicated with a dotted line in the high-ε
region. See the main text for details.

Procedure to introduce a total-energy cutoff in
the anomalous MT contribution

In what concerns the anomalous MT term,30 the quasiparticles resulting from the decay of a fluctuation of momentum q give rise to an extra contribution to the conductivity that should be proportional to the superfluid
density, ns (q, ε) ∝ [ε+ξ 2 (0)q2 ]−1 , and to a diffusion time
1/Dq 2 (where D is the diffusion constant) unrelated to
the superconducting relaxation time τs (q, ε).31 A detailed
calculation leads to,32

indicating the ∆σ amplitude (color scale). The data points represent the low-T applicability limit for the theoretical approach

H. These points agree with the onset of the critical fluctuation region as evaluated from the H-dependent Ginzburg criterion
(thick solid line, Eq. (11)). The dashed line is the reduced upper critical field. See the main text for details.

This transformation accounts for the low momentum cutoff, q2min = δ/ξ 2 (0), to remove the divergence in ∆σMT
occurring in low dimensional systems, allowing to start
the sums and integrals in momentum space at q = 0 instead of cutting their low limit. A problem now arises
when attempting to apply the total energy cutoff to this
equation. While the term associated to ns (q, ε) has to be
cut off, no restriction has to be imposed to the relaxation
time of the quasiparticles. To solve these difficulties, let
us note that the total-energy cutoff forbids the existence
of fluctuations above ε = c, and that ∆σMT (ε, c) should
vanish at this reduced temperature analogously to the
direct contribution. Thus, instead of directly cutting the
sum over q in Eq. (5), we have calculated ∆σMT (ε, c) by
subtracting to ns (q, ε) the superfluid density at ε = c,
ns (q, ε) −→ ns (q, ε, c) = ns (q, ε) − ns (q, c),

(6)

which directly leads to
∆σMT (ε, c) = ∆σMT (ε) − ∆σMT (c)

(7)

Following this procedure we reproduce the basic features
of the inclusion of a total-energy cutoff (mainly, the vanishing of the fluctuation effects at ε = c), but acting only
in the superconducting part of the MT-term. It is worth
noting that, when calculating direct contributions to fluctuation effects, this procedure leads to the same results

as the direct limitation of the sums over q by the total
energy cutoff condition.

Generalization of ∆σM T to high-ε and -h

(close to the value obtained by fitting the expression
without a cutoff) and c = 0.85, a value near the one
that may be expected for dirty superconductors.9

In what follows we obtain an expression for ∆σMT
to
analyze the paraconductivity in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field (Fig. 4). Our starting point is Eq. (5)

example of the application of this procedure to the calculus of the AL term in the presence of a magnetic field
may be seen, for instance, in Ref. 28. This leads to

Analysis of ∆σ for finite H in terms of the
generalized AL and MT approaches

The solid lines in Fig. 4(a) are a fit of Eq. (3)+Eq. (10)
by using the above δ and c values, letting Hc2 (0) as the
only free parameter. The data included in the fit correspond to magnetic fields up to 0.2 T and reduced temperatures down to ε = 0, although an excellent agreement
is observed well beyond those limits (see below). The resulting µ0 Hc2 (0) is 0.82 T, which corresponds to a coherence length amplitude of ξ(0) = [φ0 /2πµ0 Hc2 (0)]1/2 =
20 nm. This value is larger than the average grains’ diameter, indicating that they are strongly coupled. It is
also larger than the film thickness (∼ 10 nm), consistently with the observed 2D behavior. As ξ(T ) is always
larger than ξ(0), it is expected that no dimensional transition will take place upon increasing the temperature
above Tc , in particular the 2D-0D transition that would
be associated to a decoupling of the grains (although this
effect could still be present in films with a smaller ξ(0)).
A detail of the field dependence of ∆σ for two selected
ε values is presented in Fig. 4(b). The solid lines are
Eq. (3)+Eq. (10) evaluated with the same parameters as
in Fig. 4(a). An excellent agreement is observed up to
h ≈ 0.4 (i.e., µ0 H ≈ 0.3 T). For comparison, the dashed
line for ε = 0.015 was obtained by using the same approach but without cutoff (i.e., by setting c → ∞). While
a good agreement with the data is obtained for H → 0
(as expected after the analysis presented in Fig. 3), a notable disagreement is obtained in the finite field region.

This shows that the introduction of a total-energy cutoff
is not only needed to explain the data at high reduced
temperatures, but also at high reduced magnetic fields,
where the theory also overestimates the contribution of
the high-energy modes.1,2
The theory agrees with the observed ∆σ down to the
data points in the h − ε phase diagram presented in
Fig. 4(c). This limit is consistent with the H-dependent
Ginzburg criterion for the onset of the critical fluctuation
region in 2D superconductors (solid line),34

T /Tc = 1 − h − 2kB h/ξ 2 (0)d∆c,

as evaluated by using the ξ(0) value obtained above, and
a specific heat jump at Tc of ∆c = 345 J/m3 K, a value
in reasonable agreement with the one obtained in similar
granular Al films.35

IV.

CONCLUSIONS

The present results show that the seemingly anomalous ∆σ behavior of granular Al thin films at high-ε, attributed in similar films to dimensional transitions, may
be explained by introducing a total energy cutoff in the
fluctuation spectrum in both the direct AL term and the
anomalous MT contribution. Such cutoff is also crucial
to describe at a quantitative level the high-h behavior,
where the theoretical approaches also overestimate the
contribution of the short wavelength fluctuations. These
results could thus help to elucidate long standing but
still open questions concerning the Al thin films, including the mechanism that enhance their Tc . In particular, it has been recently proposed that the Josephson
coupling between neighboring grains weakens the quantum confinement in each grain, and should also weaken
the associated Tc enhancement. In our films we find
ξ(0) ∼ 20 − 48 nm, much larger than the grains size
(5 − 10 nm), indicating a strong inter-grain coupling. In
spite of that, Tc ∼ 1.9 − 2.1 K, still as high as two times
the bulk value and almost independent on ξ(0). Our
results suggest that the superconductivity in these materials is homogeneous in nature, and that the grains size
distribution does not seem to play a relevant role. This
questions a purely confinement mechanism for the Tc enhancement, which still remains an open issue. It would
be interesting to extend the present study to other superconductors and experimental conditions (e. g., other
grain sizes and/or dimensionalities).

To complement the results on film A described in detail

confirm the applicability of our theoretical approach and
support the results obtained in film A.

text for details.

Film B

This film was grown under a oxygen pressure 33%
smaller than film A (10−8 bar). The temperature dependence of its resistivity around Tc under different perpendicular magnetic fields is presented in Fig. 5. The normal state resistivity and the Tc value (1.9 K) are slightly
smaller than for film A (see Table I), probably as a consequence of a better coupling between the Al grains. The
background contribution was obtained for each applied
field by a linear fit above Tonset = 5 K, the temperature
above which fluctuation effects are below the noise level.
Examples for H = 0 and 200 mT are presented as solid
lines in the inset of Fig. 5 (both lines are indistinguishable in this scale).

in all the accessible ε-region above ε ≈ 10−2 , and the resulting δ value (∼ 0.1, compiled in Table I), is within the
values found in Al films with a similar sheet resistance,
see Refs. 26 and 27. Just for comparison, the same theoretical approach but without a cutoff (i.e., with c → ∞)
is presented as a dashed line. As it may be seen, the
agreement in this case extends only up to ε ≈ 0.1.

and with Hc2 (0) (that is implicit in h) as the only free
parameter. The agreement is good down to ε ≈ 0, near
the onset of the critical fluctuation region. The resulting µ0 Hc2 (0) value (0.14 T) leads to a coherence length
amplitude of ξ(0) = 48 nm, significantly larger than the
superconducting grains. This suggests that the grains are
strongly coupled, which is consistent with the observed

By using a 10% (90%) criterion on the normal-state
resistivity to determine Tc (H) it is obtained ξ(0) =
18 (21) nm. As this value is ∼ 5 times smaller than the
film thickness, it is expected that the fluctuation effects
are not 2D in this case. However, the ε-dependence of ∆σ
for H = 0 (Fig. 8(a)) cannot be explained even at low-ε
by the conventional AL + M T 3D approach (see, e.g.,
Ref. 32) evaluated with ξ(0) = 20 nm and δ = 0 (dotdashed line). The use of a finite δ value increases the

This film was grown under the same oxygen pressure
(10−8 bar) as film A, but is 10 times thicker (100 nm).
The temperature dependence of its resistivity around Tc
under different perpendicular magnetic fields is presented
in Fig. 7. As expected, the Tc value (2.07 K) is the same
as for film A (see Table I), but the normal state resistivity is slightly smaller, probably as a consequence of its
three-dimensional microstructure. The background contribution was obtained for each applied field by a linear fit
above Tonset = 4.4 K, the temperature above which fluctuation effects vanish. Examples for H = 0 and 200 mT
are presented as solid lines in the inset of Fig. 7 (both
lines are indistinguishable in this scale).
In this sample it is possible to appreciate the Tc shift
with H. This allows to estimate the coherence length
from the GL relation

approach without a cutoff (with c → ∞), that illustrates the

text for details.

generalization of the AL+MT approach to superconductors with an intermediate 2D-3D dimensionality. This
may be easily obtained from the 2D approach presented
above by following the procedure described in Ref. 32.

A detailed calculation of these expressions will be presented elsewhere. It is worth noting that they reduce
to the 2D and 3D limits when d ≪ ξ(0) and d ≫ ξ(0),
respectively.
The solid line in Fig. 8(a) corresponds to the 2D-3D
AL+MT approach under the cutoff, evaluated with c =

in Al films with a similar sheet resistance, see Refs. 26

and 27), and ξ(0) = 21 nm (within the values obtained
above from the Tc (H) shift). These values are compiled
in Table I. The agreement is now good in all the accessible
temperature region above ε ≈ 10−2 . For comparison, the
same theoretical approach but without a cutoff (i.e., with
c → ∞) is presented as a dashed line. As expected the
agreement in this case extends only up to ε ≈ 0.1. As
for the other samples, the coherence length is larger than
the superconducting grains, which is consistent with a
strong intergrain coupling and with the observed non-0D
behavior.
The ε-dependence of ∆σ under different applied magnetic fields is presented in Fig. 8(b). The solid lines are
the 2D-3D AL+MT approach with a total-energy cutoff,
evaluated with the same parameters as in Fig. 8(a). As
it may be seen the agreement is excellent down to temperatures slightly below ε = 0, where critical fluctuations
are expected to be appreciable. The h-dependence of ∆σ
is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 8(b) for some ε values.

normal-state resistivity ρN = 6×10−4 Ωcm, ∆c agrees with
the BCS prediction, while it decreases in films with a larger
ρN . In our films ρN ∼ 10−4 Ωcm. Then, by assuming that
the BCS prediction is applicable, and using the specificheat coefficient γ corresponding to this ρN (γ ∼ 25µJ/K2 g,
see Fig. 4 in the second quoted work), it would be expected
∆c ≈ 200 J/m3 K.
