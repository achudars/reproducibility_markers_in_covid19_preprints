ABSTRACT. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment at the South Pole is designed
to detect high-energy neutrinos which, via in-ice interactions, produce coherent radiation
at frequencies up to 1000 MHz. In Dec. 2018, a custom high-amplitude radio-frequency
transmitter was lowered into the 1700 m SPICE ice core to provide test sources for
ARA receiver stations sensitive to vertical and horizontal polarizations. For these tests,
signal geometries correspond to obliquely propagating radio waves from below. The ARA
collaboration has recently measured the polarization-dependent time delay variation, and
report more significant time delays for trajectories perpendicular to ice flow. Here we use
fabric data from the SPICE ice core to construct a bounding model for the ice birefringence
and the polarization time delays across ARA. The data-model comparison is consistent with
the vertical girdle fabric at the South Pole having the prevailing horizontal crystallographic
axis oriented near-perpendicular to ice flow. This study presents the possibility that ice
birefringence can be used to constrain the range to a neutrino interaction, and hence aid in
neutrino energy reconstruction, for in-ice experiments such as ARA.

1. INTRODUCTION
Neutrinos are elementary particles whose interactions with polar ice molecules can be detected from the emission of Cherenkov
radiation. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is a neutrino experiment at the South Pole that aims to detect high-energy
neutrinos which produce coherent Cherenkov radiation in a radio-frequency band ∼ 150-800 MHz (Allison and others, 2012).
The ARA detectors are ∼ 150 m below the ice surface with the targeted neutrino interactions occurring at ice depths ∼
100-2000 m. The emitted radio waves from the ice-neutrino interaction propagate at oblique angles relative to the vertical
direction with the trajectories from the deeper interaction source to the shallower detector often close to horizontal.
Characterization of the radio-frequency (bulk) permittivity of polar ice is critical to optimizing the ARA detector sensitivity
and to reconstruct information about ice-neutrino interactions (Allison and others, 2019a; Kravchenko and others, 2011).
The real component of the permittivity relates to the volume of ice visible to the radio receiver array, whilst the imaginary
component relates to the attenuation of the radio signal. Due to the presence of ice fabric - the orientation distribution of
ice crystals - polar ice behaves as a birefringent medium whereby radio wave polarizations experience different permittivities
and propagate at different phase velocities (Hargreaves, 1978). Characterization of ice birefringence is important for the ARA
experiment as it would facilitate a range estimate from the interaction source to the detector based on polarization time delays
at the detectors, and, subsequently aid in neutrino energy reconstruction. Measured polarization time delays using radio test
sources have demonstrated that a significant birefringence (∼ 0.1-0.3 % of the mean refractive index) is present for oblique
angle trajectories (Allison and others, 2019a; Kravchenko and others, 2011). However, a first-principles propagation model
that predicts the polarization time delays is yet to be developed.
Since the commencement of the ARA experiment, the SPICE (South Pole Ice Core Experiment) team have collected ice
fabric data that extends down to a depth ∼ 1750 m (Voigt, 2017). Ice fabric is of interest in glaciology as it contains information
about ice-sheet flow history (Alley, 1988) and changes in ice fabric are often correlated with climatic transitions (Kennedy and
others, 2013). Polarimetric radar sounding is often used to complement direct sampling of ice fabric (Brisbourne and others,
2019; Dall, 2010; Drews and others, 2012; Fujita and others, 2006; Jordan and others, 2019b; Li and others, 2018), and it can
be used to reference azimuthal fabric orientation which is generally not recorded directly during ice coring (Faria and others,
2010; Wang and others, 2002). Terrestrial radar-sounding systems operate in a similar frequency range (∼ 50-400 MHz) to
the coherent radio-frequency emissions induced by neutrinos. Consequently, effective medium models of ice birefringence and
radio propagation developed by the radar-sounding community (Fujita and others, 2006; Matsuoka and others, 2009) are of
direct relevance to understanding the polarization time delays at the ARA experiment.
The primary focus of this study is to use SPICE fabric data to place bounds upon radio-frequency ice birefringence and
polarization time delays for oblique radio propagation at the ARA. In Section 2 we motivate the investigation by summarizing

oblique radio test-source measurements for polarization time delays, including new measurements from Dec. 2018. In Section
3 we use SPICE fabric data (Voigt, 2017) and an effective medium framework (Fujita and others, 2006) to model the radiofrequency ice birefringence at the South Pole. In Section 4 we construct an oblique radio wave propagation model. In Section
5 we place model bounds upon polarization time delays and compare with the measurements. In Section 6 we discuss the
consequences for neutrino source reconstruction and the understanding of ice fabric in the South Pole region.

2. RADIO TEST-SOURCE MEASUREMENTS
2.1. Overview of the ARA experiment
The ARA experiment is designed to operate in the 150-800 MHz radio-frequency band, with the goal of detecting impulsive
emissions from collisions of high-energy, extraterrestrial neutrinos with ice molecules. As part of the initial ARA receiver
calibration, three ‘deep’ radio-frequency pulsers were deployed at the depths typical of neutrino interactions (two at 1400 m
and one at 2450 m depths). More recently, in Dec. 2018 a custom high-amplitude radio-frequency transmitter was lowered into
the 1700 m SPICE ice core to provide test sources for ARA receiver stations which are located 1-5 km from the test sources.
In this study we focus upon measurements from ARA receiver stations 2 and 4 (“A2” and “A4”, respectively). The radio
trajectories to A2 are approximately flow-perpendicular (azimuthal angles to flow ∼ 77 ◦ and ∼ 79 ◦ respectively for the
SPICE and deep pulser sources). The radio trajectories to A4 are approximately flow-parallel (azimuthal angles to flow ∼ 1 ◦
and ∼ 18 ◦ respectively for the SPICE and deep pulser sources). A plan-view of the experiment in shown in Fig. 1.

2.2. Polarization time delay measurements
The ARA collaboration has reported time delays for data taken using the deep pulser sources IC1S DP and IC22S DP (Allison
and others, 2019a,b; Jordan and others, 2019a), as well as for the SPICE icehole pulser. Most interestingly, they find signal
arrival time differences between horizontally polarized (h) versus vertically polarized (v) signals arriving from the A2 and
A4 stations. For both sets of broadcasts, the horizontal baselines are comparable (approximately 2300 m and 3200 m for
SPICE→A2 and SPICE→A4, and approximately 3700 m, in each case, for broadcasts from the deep pulsers). Since each
station consists of eight doublets of approximately co-located v and h receivers, each station provides up to eight independent
measurements of the h-v arrival time difference, ∆Th,v .
Using data for the v channels (notated by 0–7) versus the h channels (notated by 8–15), with v-h doublet channel assignments
separated by eight units presented previously by Jordan and others (2019a), we fitted the ∆Th,v distributions to Gaussian
signal shapes. The results of fits that converged and also had an acceptable χ2 are presented in Table 1. We note the clear
offset between the most-probable signal arrival time differences for the A2 station (significant negative h-v time delays) versus
the A4 station (generally negligible h-v time delays). Further context for how the polarization delays can be use for neutrino
source reconstruction is given in Section 6.1.

3. MODELLING ICE BIREFRINGENCE
3.1. Effective medium model
At radio frequencies the bulk dielectric tensor, principal refractive indices, and birefringence of polar ice can be modeled by
combining ice fabric measurements (the c-axis orientation distribution) with information about the birefringence of individual

ice crystals (Fujita and others, 2006; Matsuoka and others, 2009). This effective medium approach was developed to interpret
polarimetric radar sounding measurements (Brisbourne and others, 2019; Fujita and others, 2006; Jordan and others, 2019b;
Matsuoka and others, 2012) and assumes that the dimensions of the ice crystal grains (∼ mm) are much less than radio
wavelength in ice (∼ dm-m for the frequency-range relevant to ARA).
Individual ice crystals have hexagonal structure and are uniaxially birefringent with the optic axis aligned with the
crystallographic axis (c-axis) (Hargreaves, 1978). The magnitude of the crystal birefringence (in terms of the permittivity)
is given by ∆0 = (kc − ⊥c ) where kc and ⊥c are the principal permittivities parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis
with kc > ⊥c (Fujita and others, 2000). (The notation ∆0 is used as the radar sounding literature normally uses ∆ for
the bulk birefringence.) At radio frequencies and as ice temperature increases from -60-0◦ C, ∆0 increases by ∼ 5% from ∼
0.0325-0.0345 (Fujita and others, 2000; Matsuoka and others, 1996).
Ice fabric measurements consist of thin ice core sections that measure the ice crystal orientation distribution in terms of a
second order orientation tensor (Montagnat and others, 2014; Woodcock, 1977). The orientation tensor represents the c-axis
orientation distribution as an ellipsoid where the eigenvalues, E1 , E2 , E3 represent the relative c-axis concentration along
each principal coordinate direction. The eigenvalues have the property E1 + E2 + E3 = 1, and following the radar polarimetry
convention we assume, E3 > E2 > E1 . Using this eigenvalue framework, the bulk principal dielectric tensor is given by

(Fujita and others, 2006). For the general case, (E1 6= E2 6= E3 ), polar ice therefore behaves as a biaxial medium (three
different principal permittivities). The principal refractive indices, which correspond to the axes of biaxial indicatrix ellipsoid

Matsuoka and others (2009) further discusses the biaxial indicatrix representation, and how it relates to different propagation
directions in radar sounding.
The ice fabric depends on the stress regimes present an ice sheet. Due to ice viscosity being an order of magnitude higher
parallel to the c-axis than perpendicular, aggregates of ice crystals tend to align toward the compression axis and away from the
extension axis (Alley, 1988). End-member classes used to describe ice fabrics are: ‘random’ (E1 ≈ E2 ≈ E3 ≈ 1 and associated

with the near-surface),‘single-pole’ (E1 ≈ E2 ≈ 0, E3 ≈ 1 and associated with deeper ice undergoing vertical compression),
and ‘vertical girdle’ (E1 ≈ 0, E2 ≈ E3 ≈ 21 and associated with lateral tension).

3.2. Principal refractive index profiles from the SPICE ice core
Figure 2a shows fabric eigenvalue profiles from the SPICE ice core at a ∼ 20 m vertical resolution (Voigt, 2017). The plot
indicates development from a relatively random fabric in shallower ice (E3 ≈ 0.45, E2 ≈ 0.30, E1 ≈ 0.25 at z = 150 m) to
a vertical girdle fabric in deeper ice (E3 ≈ 0.50, E2 ≈ 0.49, E1 ≈ 0.01 at z = 1750 m). Profiles for the principal refractive
indices, calculated as above with ⊥ =3.157 and ∆0 = 0.034 (corresponding to a polarization-averaged refractive index n̄ =
1.78) are shown in Fig. 2b.
Due to the dominance of vertical compression, the 3 direction (greatest c-axis concentration) is generally close to being
aligned with the vertical Matsuoka and others (2009), and is typically approximated as vertical in polarimetric radar sounding
studies (Brisbourne and others, 2019; Fujita and others, 2006; Jordan and others, 2019b). Since the azimuthal orientation of
the ice core fabric sections are not recorded during drilling, the 1 and 2 directions are not initially known. For an ice flow
model where there is a lateral component of tension present, the 2 direction (greatest c-axis concentration in horizontal plane)
is expected to be approximately perpendicular to the horizontal flow direction, with the 1 direction parallel to flow (Fujita
and others, 2006; Wang and others, 2002). Using polarimetric radar sounding, this predicted behavior has been verified at ice
divides such as the NEEM ice core region in northern Greenland (Dall, 2010; Jordan and others, 2019b).

4. MODELLING OBLIQUE RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION
In the radio propagation model, we assume that the ice sheet can be modelled as a stratified anisotropic medium. Each layer of
the ice sheet has thickness δzi which is determined from the vertical spacing of the SPICE ice core eigenvalue data (∼ 20 m).
The dielectric properties of each layer are defined by the dielectric tensor, Eqn. (1), corresponding to the principal refractive
indices, Eqn (4). Lacking information about the azimuthal fabric orientation, we assume the conventional fabric orientation
described in Section 3.2, with the 3 direction vertical, the 2 direction perpendicular to flow and the 1 direction parallel to flow.
The radio propagation model is formulated for s- and p-polarizations (E-field perpendicular and parallel to the
rotation/incidence plane, respectively); a schematic of the model geometry is shown in Fig. 3a. The model considers two
bounding rotation scenarios: (i) rotation in the 2,3 plane (assumed to be in the plane perpendicular to flow), (ii) rotation in
the 1,3 plane (assumed to be to be in the plane parallel to flow). The principal refractive indices in relation to model geometry
are shown in Fig. 3b. For these restricted rotation scenarios, the s- and p-polarizations propagate along independent paths
within the ice sheet and a double refraction/ray propagation model can be used.
This model approach is analogous to modelling oblique propagation birefringent optical reflectors (Orfanidis, 2002; Weber
and others, 2000). Computationally, the model is set-up with the source depth and the horizontal baseline fixed with sin(θp,i )

and sin(θs,i ) as degrees of freedom to be solved for subject to Snell’s law being satisfied in each layer. The model is equivalent
to Fermat’s least time principle being satisfied separately by each polarization mode.

where the first subscript indicates the principal refractive index component with θp,i the p-polarization propagation angle in
the ith layer (Matsuoka and others, 2009; Orfanidis, 2002). For rotation in the 1, 3 plane the 1 and 2 subscripts are interchanged
between Eqn (6) and Eqn (5). The propagation angles in each layer are derived from separate applications of Snell’s law:
np,i sin(θp,i ) = np,0 sin(θp,0 )

(7)

ns,i sin(θs,i ) = ns,0 sin(θs,0 )

(8)

where θs,i is the s-polarization propagation angle in the ith layer and the subscript 0 indicates the source layer. Orfanidis
(2002) provides analytical expressions for θp,i in terms of the principal refractive indices that were used in the model code. The
deviation between θs,i and θp,i from a straight-line trajectory increases with the angle of incidence, with the highest angular
offset in our simulation domain ∼ 0.2◦ .
The radio propagation model enables calculation of the s-p signal arrival time delay for rotation in the planes of the principal
axes, which serve as bounding cases for the observed h-v time delays at the receiver stations. In each layer of the ice sheet the
radio path lengths are given by

the range for a given depth increases with propagation angle.

5. RESULTS
5.1. Model bounds on ice birefringence and polarization time delays
Figure 4a) and b) show modelled s-p time delays perpendicular and parallel to ice flow for a range of source depths and
horizontal baselines. For the flow-perpendicular case, ∆Ts,p is always negative and increases with both ice depth and horizontal
baseline. For the flow-parallel case, ∆Ts,p switches sign from positive to negative at incidence angle ∼ 65-70◦ . |∆Ts,p | is
considerably more significant perpendicular than parallel to flow.
There is a simple explanation for the relationships in Fig. 4a) and b) in terms of the s-p birefringence: ∆ns,p = ns − np . (In
the flow-perpendicular case ns is given by n1 and np is given by a mixing of n2 and n3 , whereas for the flow-parallel case ns is
given by n2 and np is given by a mixing of n1 and n3 ). Depth-averaged plots for ∆ns,p are shown in Fig. 4c) and d), with the
incidence angle for a straight-line trajectory shown in Fig. 4e. In the flow-perpendicular case, since n1 < n2 < n3 , it follows
that ∆ns,p < 0 and ∆Ts,p < 0 hold for all angles of incidence. In the flow-parallel case, ∆ns,p switches sign from positive to
negative at the same incidence angle where ∆Ts,p switches sign. Conceptually, this behavior occurs due to the p-polarization
refractive index becoming dominated by n3 refractive index component at oblique angles and n1 for shallow angles. At normal
incidence (xb = 0), ∆ns,p for the flow-perpendicular case equals −∆ns,p for the flow-parallel case.
Previous analysis of ice birefringence at the South Pole is discussed in terms of fractional ‘birefringent asymmetry’ (Allison
and others, 2019a; Kravchenko and others, 2011) which be estimated via the ratio |ns − np |/n̄ where n̄ = 1.78 is the mean
refractive index. For the flow-perpendicular case |ns − np | ranges from 0.02-0.035, which corresponds to |ns − np |/n̄ ∼ 0.11-0.20
%.
In the ARA experiment the elevation and azimuth angles of a trajectory are well-constrained (see Sect. 6.1 for more details),
with the range (i.e. the distance along a trajectory for specified elevation and azimuth) the major unknown. Figure 4f) shows
the relationship between the modeled polarization time delay and range for the flow-perpendicular scenario (fixed azimuth)
for three fixed propagation angles (fixed elevation).

5.2. Model-data comparison
The modelled s-p time delays for the flow-perpendicular and flow-parallel cases are compared with measured h-v time delays
from the A2 and A4 stations (mean and rms deviation averaged over all channels in Table 1) respectively in Fig. 5. This
comparison assumes equivalent horizontal baselines to the source-receiver measurements and the model curves in Fig. 5

correspond to vertical slices in Fig. 4a) and c). For the flow-perpendicular case, the measured time delays are ∆Th,v =-14.1 ±
2.8 ns (SPICE-A2 trajectory) and ∆Th,v =-25.2 ± 2.0 ns (deep pulser-A2 trajectory) with modeled time delays ∆Ts,p =-22.5
ns and -42.5 ns respectively. For flow-parallel case, the measured time delays are ∆Th,v =4.6 ± 9 ns (SPICE-A4 trajectory) and
∆Th,v =0.7 ± 1.4 ns (deep pulser-A4 trajectory) with modeled time delays ∆Ts,p = -1.6 ns and ∆Ts,p =0.2 ns, respectively.
The magnitude of the modeled polarization time delays are 60% (SPICE) and 69% (deep pulser) greater than measured for
the flow-perpendicular/A2 case. The overestimate of the modeled time delay is unsurprising as the modelled flow-perpendicular
scenario serves as maximum bound upon |Ts,p |. (This bound follows from the inequality n3 > n2 > n1 , and the assumption
of a fixed fabric orientation with respect to ice depth). As described in Section 2, the A2 trajectories are only approximately
perpendicular to flow, which would result in a reduction in the birefringence from the bounding case.
It also is to be noted that the modeled p-polarization is not strictly equivalent to the measured v-polarization. In general, the
p polarization consists of horizontal and vertical components, becoming solely vertical at glancing incidence (90◦ ). However,
the trajectories in the model-data comparison, Fig. 5, are highly oblique with the smallest angle of incidence ∼ 70◦ .

6. DISCUSSION
6.1. Implications for range reconstruction of neutrino interactions
The goal of experiments such as ARA is to, first, observe ultra-high energy neutrinos (Eν > 1017 eV) originating from outside
the solar system, and, second to accumulate a sample of neutrinos with sufficient statistics to measure both a neutrino energy
spectrum and also source arrival directions in the sky. In practice, as neutrinos are observed via the radio Cherenkov emissions
emanating from the in-ice collision point, inferring the original neutrino direction (coincident with the central axis of the
signal Cherenkov cone) requires measurement of the electric field signal polarization, projected onto v- and h-oriented receiver
antennas.
Although this study does not inform such estimates of source direction, it does, nevertheless, have direct implications for
neutrino energy reconstruction, which requires estimating the range, R, to an in-ice collision point. Knowledge of the range
can then be translated into a neutrino energy estimate, after correcting for 1/R diminution and in-ice signal absorption.
Current interferometric interaction-point reconstruction methods provide excellent angular resolution, of order 0.5 degrees in
both elevation and azimuth, but are generally unreliable for range estimates, which conventionally require measurement of the
wavefront curvature across receivers separated by O(10 m), and viewing a source point over a distance of O(1000 m).
The results of this study offer considerable promise for range determination, assuming the ray inclination relative to the
local fabric has first been determined from interferometry. Specifically, Fig. 4f demonstrates that there is a near-linear negative
relationship between the range and the polarization time delay for the flow-perpendicular case. As this case corresponds to
maximal birefringence, it places a bound upon the minimum range that can be estimated from a given measured polarization
time delay.

6.2. Future development of the radio propagation model
The oblique radio propagation model in this study represents simple bounding cases for polarization time delays at ARA.
A key limitation is that the model is only valid for rotation planes which contain the principal axes, which results in the sand p-polarizations propagating as independent modes through the ice sheet. A more general propagation model (formulated
for a general propagation direction relative to the principal axis system) would result in wave-splitting and a coupling of the
polarization modes. This mode-coupling behavior could potentially be modelled by adapting a Jones matrix model for nadir
radio propagation (Fujita and others, 2006) for oblique radio propagation.
The other key limitations of the model are that we assume that the fabric eigenvectors are precisely aligned perpendicular
and parallel to flow and are unchanging with ice depth. Whilst the model-data comparison in Section 5.2 supports this

Jordan: Modelling ice birefringence for neutrino detection

8

assumption, there is likely to be at least some deviation from this idealized behavior. Joint analysis of data from all 5 ARA
receiver stations, alongside the development of a more general radio propagation model, would enable better constraints to be
placed upon the azimuthal fabric orientation. Polarimetric radar-sounding measurements from the ice surface could also be
used as an additional constraint.

6.3. Implications for understanding of South Pole flow history
As discussed above, our model-data comparison supports the modelling ansatz that the E2 eigenvector (greatest horizontal
c-axis concentration) is perpendicular to the ice flow direction and unchanging with ice depth. This is the conventional fabric
orientation that develops when a lateral component of tension is present (Fujita and others, 2006; Wang and others, 2002).
By contrast, regions of the ice-sheets where pronounced flow-reorganization occurs, such as ice rises in the Weddell sea sector
(Brisbourne and others, 2019), exhibit azimuthal rotation in the fabric with ice depth.
Beem and others (2017) inferred from radar layering and thermodynamic modelling that the South Pole region is likely have
undergone recent ice flow re-organization. However, our model-data comparison is broadly consistent with there not being
major fabric signatures of ice-flow re-organization (i.e. variable fabric orientation with ice depth). On the other hand, a more
detailed investigation of azimuthal fabric properties and variation with ice depth could reveal more subtle fabric signatures
related to ice-flow history.

7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this study we used ice fabric data from the SPICE ice core to model radio-frequency ice birefringence and its effect upon
oblique radio wave propagation relevant to in-ice neutrino detection at the South Pole. The model framework enabled us to
consider bounding cases for polarization time delays across the array (perpendicular and parallel to ice flow assuming alignment
with the eigenvectors of the fabric orientation tensor), with a view to placing constraints upon range reconstruction for in-ice
neutrino interactions. We then compared the modelled time delays with radio-test sources measurements from the Askaryan
Radio Array (ARA) neutrino experiment.
The data-model comparison demonstrated that significant polarization time delays occur for trajectories perpendicular, but
not parallel, to the ice flow direction. This result can be understood from the polarization-dependent refractive indices that
are modelled from the ice core fabric eigenvalue data. The model demonstrated that, for flow-perpendicular trajectories, there
is an approximately linear relationship between the polarization time delay and the trajectory range. Hence, when combined
with information on ray inclination, this study raises the possibility that ice birefringence can used to constrain the range to
a neutrino interaction.
