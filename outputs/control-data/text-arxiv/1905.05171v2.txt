Abstract. We present accurate QCD predictions for the transverse momentum (p⊥ ) spectrum of electroweak gauge bosons at the LHC for 13 TeV collisions, based on a consistent combination of a NNLO
calculation at large p⊥ and N3 LL resummation in the small p⊥ limit. The inclusion of higher order corrections leads to substantial changes in the shape of the differential distributions, and the residual perturbative
uncertainties are reduced to the few percent level across the whole transverse momentum spectrum. We
examine the ratio of p⊥ distributions in charged- and neutral-current Drell-Yan production, and study different prescriptions for the estimate of perturbative uncertainties that rely on different degrees of correlation
between these processes. We observe an excellent stability of the ratios with respect to the perturbative
order, indicating a strong correlation between the corresponding QCD corrections.

1 Introduction
The differential spectrum of electroweak gauge bosons,
measured via their leptonic decays, is among the most
prominent observables at the LHC.
Owing to the outstanding precision of their experimental measurement [1–14], such observables allow for a
precise extraction of some of the Standard Model (SM)
parameters — such as the W boson mass [13], or parton densities [15–18] — as well as for the calibration of
widely used event generators and analysis tools. For this
reason, an accurate theoretical understanding of such observables is paramount to exploit the precise data and
perform meticulous tests of the SM.
Inclusive and differential distributions for neutral and
charged Drell-Yan (DY) production with lepton pair invariant mass M are nowadays known with very high precision. The total cross section is known fully differentially
in the Born phase space up to NNLO [19–27], while differential distributions in transverse momentum p⊥ were recently computed up to NNLO both for Z- [28–33] and W boson [34–36] production. In the DY distributions, elec-

troweak corrections become important especially at large
transverse momenta, and they have been computed to
NLO accuracy in [37–40].
In kinematical regimes dominated by soft and collinear
radiation, the fixed-order perturbative series for the differential p⊥ distribution is affected by large logarithmic
terms of the form αsn L2n−1 /p⊥ , with L ≡ ln(M/p⊥ ), which
must be resummed to all orders for a reliable theoretical
prediction. In such regimes, the perturbative (logarithmic)
accuracy is defined in terms of the logarithm of the cumulative cross section Σ as

One refers to the dominant terms αsn Ln+1 as leading logarithmic (LL), to terms αsn Ln as next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL), to αsn Ln−1 as next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL), and so on. The resummation of the p⊥ spectrum of SM bosons has been studied in a multitude of
theoretical formulations throughout the years [41–51], and

the current state of the art for phenomenological studies
at the LHC reaches N3 LL accuracy [51–54].
In this article, we reach a new milestone in the theoretical description of transverse momentum distributions in
both neutral and charged DY production, aiming for percent level precision throughout the full kinematical range.
This is achieved by matching the fixed-order NNLO QCD
predictions with the N3 LL resummation of large logarithmic corrections. We adopt the momentum-space formulation of refs. [49, 51], in which the resummation is performed by generating the QCD radiation by means of a
Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm. All the necessary ingredients for the N3 LL p⊥ resummation have been computed in
refs. [55–61]. The combined framework enables fully differential N3 LL+NNLO predictions for distributions that
take proper account of the fiducial volume definitions used
in the experimental measurements.
The article is organised as follows. In section 2 we
briefly review the computation of the NNLO differential
distributions in DY-pair production with the parton-level
code NNLOjet, as well as the resummation for the p⊥ distributions using the computer program RadISH. Section 3
describes our results for 13 TeV LHC collisions. Finally,
section 4 contains our conclusions.

2 Setup of the calculation
In this section we give a brief overview of the computational setup, and describe the ingredients of both the fixed
order (Section 2.1) and the resummed (Section 2.2) calculations.
2.1 Fixed order
For the calculation of the DY process, we consider the offshell production of either a pair of charged leptons (mediated by both a Z boson and a virtual photon) or a charged
lepton and a neutrino (mediated by W ± bosons), in association with partonic jets. The jet requirement is replaced
by a lower cut on the transverse momentum of the pair,
that acts as an infrared regulator of the fixed-order calculation, hence preventing the radiation from being entirely
unresolved.
The NNLO QCD predictions for neutral and charged
DY production have been obtained in refs. [28–36]. Relative to the LO distribution, in which the leptonic system
recoils against a single parton, the NNLO calculation receives contributions from configurations with two extra
partons (RR: double-real corrections [62–66]), with one
extra parton and one extra loop (RV: real-virtual corrections [62,63,67–70]) and with no extra partons but two extra loops (VV: double-virtual corrections [71–74]). Each of
the three contributions is separately infrared divergent either in an implicit manner from phase-space regions where
the partonic radiation becomes unresolved (soft and/or
collinear), or in a explicit manner from infrared poles in
virtual loop corrections. Only the sum of the three contributions is finite.

We perform the calculation using the parton-level generator NNLOjet, which implements the antenna subtraction method [75–77] to isolate infrared singularities and
to enable their cancellation between different contributions prior to the numerical phase-space integration. The
NNLO calculation can be structured as

The antenna subtraction terms, dσNNLO
, are constructed
from antenna functions [75, 78–82] to cancel infrared singularities between the contributions of different parton
multiplicities. The integrals are performed over the phase
space ΦX+1,2,3 corresponding to the production of the
colour singlet in association with one, two or three partons in the final state. The integration over the final-state
phase space is fully differential such that any infrared-safe
observable O can be studied through differential distribuNNLO
/dO.
tions as dσX+jet
The matching of the above NNLO prediction to a resummed calculation in the small p⊥ limit is computationally very challenging. At small p⊥ , both the matrix elements and the subtraction terms grow rapidly in magnitude due to the presence of un-cancelled infrared singularities. This results in large numerical cancellations between them that ultimately challenge the stability of the
final prediction. The finite remainder of such cancellations
needs to be numerically stable in order to be consistently
combined with a resummed calculation and extrapolated
to the limit p⊥ → 0. The stability of NNLOjet in this extreme regime has been tested thoroughly against the expansion of the N3 LL resummations in refs. [52, 53], where
it is shown that the NNLO calculation can be reliably
obtained down to very small p⊥ values.
The residual infrared (logarithmic) divergences that
persist in the p⊥ → 0 limit are cancelled by combining
the fixed-order computation with a resummed calculation,
where the logarithms in the fixed-order prediction are subtracted and replaced by the sum of the corresponding enhanced terms to all orders in perturbation theory. This
procedure is discussed in the following Section 2.2.

2.2 Resummation and matching
The resummation is performed in momentum space by
means of the method formulated in refs. [49, 51] and implemented in the computer code RadISH. In this approach,
the factorisation properties of the QCD matrix elements
in the soft and collinear limits are exploited to devise a
numerical procedure to generate the radiation at all perturbative orders. This allows for the resummation of the
large logarithmic terms in a fashion that is similar in spirit

Wojciech Bizoń et al.: The transverse momentum spectrum of weak gauge bosons at N3 LL+NNLO

to a Monte Carlo generator. A detailed technical description of the method can be found in Refs. [49, 51], and the
formulae up to N3 LL accuracy are collected in Ref. [53]
(Section 3 and Appendix B).
In order to have a reliable prediction across the whole
p⊥ spectrum, the fixed-order and resummed predictions
must be consistently combined through a matching procedure. The matching is performed in such a way that it
reduces to the resummed calculation at small p⊥ , while
reproducing the fixed-order prediction at large transverse
momentum. At a given perturbative order, one can adopt
various schemes that differ from one another by terms
beyond the considered order. In the present analysis we
adopt the multiplicative scheme formulated in refs. [53,83],
in which the matching is performed at the level of the cumulative distribution (1) as follows:

formula ΣN LL to O(αs3 ) (N3 LO), and the whole squared
bracket in Eq. (3) is expanded to N3 LO. It should be
recalled that O(αs3 ) corresponds to N3 LO in the total
(i.e. p⊥ -integrated) cross section and in any cumulative
distribution, while being NNLO in the fixed-order p⊥ differential cross section.

production is currently unknown, we approximate it with
the NNLO cross section [19–27] in the following. This approximation impacts only terms at N4 LL order, and is
thus beyond the accuracy considered in this study.

This prescription ensures that, in the p⊥  M limit,
Eq. (3) reproduces by construction the fixed-order result,
while in the p⊥ → 0 limit it reduces to the resummed prediction. The detailed matching formulae can be found in
Appendix A of ref. [53].
In the next section, we will also report matched predictions at lower perturbative orders, NNLL+NLO and
NLL+LO, that are obtained from the following matched

We stress once more that the ΣN
match reproduces the NNLO
total cross section at large p⊥ since the N3 LO result for the
inclusive DY process is currently unknown. The nominal
accuracy of the predictions is unaffected by this choice.
The final normalised distributions that will be reported
in Section 3 are obtained by differentiating Eqs. (3), (6)
and (7), and dividing by the respective total cross sections
of the right hand side of Eq. (8).
We recall that the resummed calculation contains a
Landau singularity arising from configurations where the
radiation is generated with transverse momentum scales
k⊥ ∼ M exp {−1/(2β0 αs )} (with αs = αs (M ) and β0 =
(11 CA − 2 nf )/(12π)). In the predictions presented in the
following, we set the results to zero when the hardest radiation’s transverse momentum reaches the singularity. For
the leptonic invariant masses studied here, this procedure
acts on radiation emitted at very small transverse momentum that, due to the vectorial nature of the observable [41, 51], gives a very small contribution to the spectrum. We however stress that for a precise description of
this kinematic regime, a thorough study of the impact of
non-perturbative corrections is necessary.

3 Results at the LHC
In this section we report our numerical results for the neutral and charged DY transverse momentum distributions
at N3 LL+NNLO.
We consider pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
13 TeV, and we use the NNLO NNPDF3.1 parton distribution function set [15] with αs (MZ ) = 0.118. The parton
densities are evolved from a low scale Q0 ∼ 1 GeV forwards with LHAPDF [84], which correctly implements the
heavy quark thresholds in the PDFs. All convolutions are
handled with the Hoppet package [85]. In the results reported below, we use the NNLO DGLAP evolution of the
adopted PDF set for all perturbative orders shown in the
figures. Although the NNLO corrections to the PDF evolution are formally of order N3 LL, we include them also
in the NLL and NNLL predictions in order to guarantee a

Wojciech Bizoń et al.: The transverse momentum spectrum of weak gauge bosons at N3 LL+NNLO

4

consistent treatment of the quark thresholds in the parton
densities. We note that this choice will lead to numerical
differences in comparison to other NLL and NNLL results
shown in the literature.
We adopt the Gµ scheme with the electro-weak parameters taken from the PDG [86], that is
MZ = 91.1876 GeV, MW = 80.379 GeV,
ΓZ = 2.4952 GeV, ΓW = 2.085 GeV,
GF = 1.1663787 × 10−5 GeV−2 .

(9)

Moreover, we set the CKM matrix equal to the identity
matrix, and we have verified that this approximation is accurate at the few-permille level. For both neutral-current
and charged-current DY we apply fiducial selection cuts
that resemble the ones used by ATLAS in previous analyses [4].
The final state for the neutral DY production is defined
by applying the following set of fiducial selection cuts on
the leptonic pair:
±

|p`⊥ | > 25 GeV,

±

|η ` | < 2.5,

66 GeV < M`` < 116 GeV,

(10)

where p`⊥ are the transverse momenta of the two leptons,
±
η ` are their pseudo-rapidities in the hadronic centreof-mass frame, and M`` is the invariant mass of the dilepton system. The central factorisation andqrenormalisa2 + |pZ |2
tion scales are chosen to be µR = µF = M``
⊥
and the central resummation scale is set to Q = M`` /2.
In the case of charged DY production, the fiducial volume is defined as
|p`⊥ | > 25 GeV,
|η ` | < 2.5,

/ T | > 25 GeV,
|E
mT > 50 GeV,

The central factorisation q
and renormalisation scales are
2 + |pW |2 and the central
chosen to be µR = µF = M`ν
⊥
resummation scale is again set to Q = M`ν /2.
In both processes, we assess the missing higher-order
uncertainties by performing a variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scales by a factor of two around their
respective central values whilst keeping 1/2 ≤ µR /µF ≤ 2.
In addition, for central factorisation and renormalisation
scales, we vary the resummation scale Q by a factor of
two in either direction. The final uncertainty is built as
the envelope of the resulting nine-scale variation.

NNLL+NLO (blue), and N3 LL+NNLO (red) in the fiducial volumes defined above. The lower inset of each panel
of Figure 1 shows the ratio of all predictions to the previous state of the art (NNLL+NLO), with the same colour
code as in the main panels. The difference between each
prediction and the next order is of O(αs ), both in the large
p⊥ region and in the limit p⊥ → 0 where αs L ∼ 1.
In comparison to the NNLL+NLO result, we note that
the N3 LL+NNLO corrections lead to important distortions in the shape of the distributions, making the spectrum harder for p⊥ & 10 GeV, and softer below this scale.
The perturbative errors are reduced by more than a factor of two across the whole p⊥ range, and the leftover
uncertainty is at the 5% level. In general, we observe a
good convergence of the perturbative description when
the order is increased, although in some p⊥ regions the
N3 LL+NNLO and the NNLL+NLO bands overlap only
marginally. This feature can be understood by noticing
that, as mentioned in Section 2.2, both predictions are
normalised to the same NNLO total cross section. Since
at large p⊥ the NNLO corrections lead to an increase in
the spectrum of about 10%, by unitarity of the matching
procedure (that preserves the total cross section) this must
be balanced by an analogous decrease in the spectrum in
the region governed by resummation, as indeed observed
in Figure 1. We stress, nevertheless, that the two orders
are compatible within the quoted uncertainties.
In Figure 2, we show the comparison among the NNLO
(green), the NNLL+NLO (blue), and N3 LL+NNLO (red)
predictions, where the bands are obtained as discussed
above. Alongside these results, we also show the Monte
Carlo predictions obtained using the Pythia8 generator [87]
with the AZ tune [3], that has been obtained from the Zboson p⊥ distribution at 7 TeV. At 7 TeV and 8 TeV the
above tune is known to correctly describe the Z transverse momentum spectrum within a few percent for p⊥ .
50 GeV [3], and it has been employed in the extraction
of the W -boson mass by the ATLAS collaboration [13].
Although it is currently unknown how this tune performs
at 13 TeV in comparison to the data, we use the Pythia8
prediction for reference in the following plots. In particular, the lower inset of each panel of Figure 2 shows the
ratio of all predictions to Pythia8. We observe a reasonable agreement between the N3 LL+NNLO predictions and
Pythia8 below 30 GeV, while it deteriorates for larger p⊥
values. This feature is particularly visible in the case of
W ± production.
A comparison of the N3 LL+NNLO band to the fixedorder one shows that the resummation starts making a
significant difference for p⊥ . 20 GeV, while above this
scale the NNLO provides a reliable theoretical prediction.
To further quantify the relative impact of the non-singular
contributions in this region, we show in Fig. 3 the difference

the PDFs at small p⊥ . Therefore, it is not clear whether
a fully correlated variation of the factorisation scale µF is
physically justified. A more conservative uncertainty prescription is to vary the scales µR and Q in numerator and
denominator in a fully correlated way, while varying µF
in an uncorrelated manner within the constraint [36]

3.2 Ratio of Z/W and W − /W + distributions
Another set of important quantities of interest are the
ratios of the above distributions, which play a central role
in recent extractions of the W -boson mass at the LHC [13].
When taking ratios of perturbative quantities one has to
decide how to combine the uncertainties in the numerator
and denominator to obtain the final error.
One option is to try to identify the possible sources of
correlation in the three processes considered here. From
the point of view of the perturbative (massless) QCD description adopted in this study, one expects the structure
of radiative corrections to such reactions to be nearly identical. This is certainly the case as far as resummation is
concerned, since it is governed by the same anomalous dimensions and all-order structure in W and Z production.
As a consequence, the resummation scale should be varied
in a correlated manner in both predictions considered in
the ratio. A similar argument can be made regarding the
renormalisation scale µR and the factorisation scale µF .
However, an important difference between Z, W + , and
W − production lies in the different combination of partonic channels probed by each process and, in particular,
in the sensitivity to different heavy quark thresholds in

where xµ is the ratio of the scale µ to its central value,
with µ ≡ {µR , µF }, together with a correlated variation of
the resummation scale Q. This recipe amounts to taking
the envelope of the predictions resulting from 33 different
combinations of scales in the ratio.
To examine the reliability of the above uncertainty
schemes, in Figure 4 we analyse the convergence of the perturbative series for the ratios of distributions, by comparing the results at NLL+LO (green), NNLL+NLO (blue),
and N3 LL+NNLO (red). The three lower panels in each
plot show the theory uncertainties obtained according
to the three prescriptions outlined above, respectively,
in comparison to the old state-of-the-art prediction at
NNLL+NLO. In the case of the Z/W + ratio (shown in
the upper plot of Figure 4), we observe that the different perturbative orders are very close to one another. The
results are compatible even within the uncertainty bands
obtained with the more aggressive error estimate, which
in some bins is sensitive to minor statistical fluctuations
due to the complexity of the NNLO calculation. This feature is strikingly evident in the case of the W − /W + ratio
(lower figure), where the excellent convergence of the series seems to indicate that either a fully correlated scale
variation or the more conservative estimate of Eq. (14) is
perfectly justified.
Figure 5 shows the comparison of the same two ratios
(Z/W + and W − /W + ) to the NNLO result (green), and to
Pythia8. We observe that in both cases the N3 LL+NNLO
calculation leads to an important reduction of the theory
uncertainty. In particular, even with the most conservative estimate of the theory error, our best prediction leads
to errors of the order of 5%, with the exception of the first
bin where the perturbative uncertainty is at the 10% level.
The kink around p⊥ ∼ 50 − 60 GeV in the Z/W + ratio
(upper plot in Figure 5) is due to the different fiducial
selection cuts in the two processes. A change in the shape
of the distributions around this scale is indeed visible in
Figure 2, at slightly different p⊥ values for Z and W +
production, respectively, that is reflected in the structure
observed in Figure 5. We find a good agreement between
our best predictions at N3 LL+NNLO and the Pythia8

Wojciech Bizoń et al.: The transverse momentum spectrum of weak gauge bosons at N3 LL+NNLO

Monte Carlo in the small p⊥ region of the ratios. However,
the two predictions are not compatible within the quoted
theory uncertainties if the scales are varied in a fully correlated manner. On the other hand, for p⊥ & 40 GeV,
the Pythia8 result disagrees with the matched calculation. This behavior is not unexpected, since the nominal
perturbative accuracy of Pythia8 is well below any of the
matched calculations, and the AZ tune is optimised to describe the Z spectrum in the region p⊥ ≤ 50 GeV at
7 TeV.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we computed the transverse momentum distributions of electroweak gauge bosons at the LHC to
N3 LL+NNLO accuracy in QCD. This calculation opens
up a new level of theoretical precision in the description of these observables. The new state-of-the-art prediction is obtained by combining the NNLO results from the
NNLOjet program with the N3 LL resummation performed
with RadISH. Our phenomenological study adopts fiducial
selection cuts similar to the setup adopted by ATLAS in
previous studies. The numerical results we presented are
made available in electronic format as additional material
alongside this manuscript.
We find that, in comparison to the fixed-order prediction, the resummation effects become important for
p⊥ . 20 GeV. The effect of the N3 LL+NNLO corrections
with respect to the previous NNLL+NLO prediction is
as large as ∼ 10%, and leads to significant shape distortions as well as to a substantial reduction in the perturbative uncertainty due to missing higher-order corrections.
In particular, the distributions considered in this article
are predicted with a residual uncertainty below the 5%
level across most of the p⊥ spectrum. We also compared
the results to the predictions obtained from the Pythia8
Monte Carlo with the AZ tune, that has been determined
using the ATLAS experimental data for the Z boson transverse momentum at 7 TeV [3].
Finally, we examined the ratios of the Z to W + , and
W − to W + distributions, which play an important role in
the W mass extraction at the LHC. We consider different
prescriptions for the estimate of perturbative uncertainties
that rely on different degrees of correlation between the
scales in the numerator and in the denominator. We find a
remarkable convergence of the predictions for the ratios at
different perturbative orders. This fact strongly indicates
that the class of processes considered in this study feature very similar perturbative corrections suggesting that
the perturbative sources of uncertainty are correlated to
a large extent.
There are, however, additional sources of perturbative
corrections to W ± and Z production that we ignored in
our study. In particular, at the level of the residual theoretical errors obtained in our predictions, PDF theory uncertainties [88, 89], QED corrections [90, 91], as well as a
careful study of the impact of mass effects [92–102] become
necessary. The correlation pattern between the uncertainties due to such effects may well be different from what we

have observed in this paper, and a dedicated study must
be performed in order to reliably combine these effects
with the N3 LL+NNLO predictions presented here.
