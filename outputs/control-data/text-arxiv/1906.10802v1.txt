a family of positive solutions uε ∈ Hε which concentrates around the local
minima of V in Λ as ε → 0. With Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory, we also
obtain multiple solutions by employing the topology construct of the set where
the potential V attains its minimum.

This kind of hypothesis was first introduced by del Pino and Felmer in [16]. The
nonlinearity f : R → R is of C 1 -class function. Since we are looking for positive
solutions, we may assume that f (τ ) = 0 for τ < 0. Furthermore, we need the
following conditions:
(f0 ) lim+ fτ(τ3 ) = 0;
τ →0

(f1 ) there exist λ > 0 and C > 0 such that f (τ ) ≥ λτ q−1 for some 4 ≤ q < 2∗s and
|f ′ (τ )| ≤ C(1 + |τ |p−2 ), where 4 < p < 2∗s ;
(f2 ) fτ(τ3 ) is non-decreasing in τ ∈ (0, +∞).

By a classical solution of (1.1), we mean two continuous functions that (−∆)s u is
well defined for all x ∈ R3 and satisfies (1.1) in pointwise sense.
In the last several years, nonlinear equations involving fractional Laplacian is
much of interest, and attracts much attention by many scholars. One of the main
reason is that fractional operators appear in many mathematical and physical problems, such as: fractional quantum mechanics [27, 28], Financial modelling [14],
anomalous diffusion [31], obstacle problems [41], conformal geometry and minimal surfaces [12] and so on. Another main reason is that the fractional Laplacian
(−∆)s (s ∈ (0, 1)) is a non-local operator comparing with the classical Laplacian
−∆ which is a local one, the methods which were previously developed, maybe not
be applied directly. We refer the interesting readers to see the recent progresses
such as [9, 13, 15, 17, 20, 19, 32, 33, 34, 41, 39, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48] and the references
therein.
In the very recent, fractional Schrödinger-Poisson system

(−∆)s u + V (x)u + φu = f (u) in R3 ,
(1.2)
(−∆)t φ = u2

has been investigated by some scholars. When f (u) = |u|p−1 u for 2 < p < 2∗s − 1

or f (u) = µ|u|q−1 + |u|2s −2 u with q ∈ ( 3s+t
s+t , 2s ) and µ > 0 which maybe large for
some q, in [44, 45], we established the existence of positive ground state solution
by using the Nehari-Pohozaev manifold combing monotone trick with global compactness Lemma, respectively. In [48], the authors studied the existence of radial
solutions for system (2.1) with the nonlinearity f (u) verifying the subcritical or
critical assumptions of Berestycki-Lions type.
For the semiclassical state, in [33], the authors studied the semiclassical state of
the following system

f (u) satisfies the following subcritical growth assumptions: 0 < KF (t) ≤ f (t)t

adapting some ideas of Benci, Cerami and Passaseo [7, 8] and using the LjusternickSchnirelmann Theory, the authors obtained the multiplicity of positive solutions
which concentrate on the minima of V (x) as ε → 0. Using the similar methods,
the authors in [30] studied the system (1.1) and established the multiplicity and
concentration behavior of solutions. In [46], we also studied the concentration of
positive ground state solution via the Nehari manifold for the following system
 2s
∗
ε (−∆)s u + V (x)u + φu = K(x)f (u) + Q(x)|u|2s −2 u in R3 ,
ε2t (−∆)t φ = u2
in R3 ,
where V (x), K(x), Q(x) is a bounded continuous potential and f satisfies the
subcritical growth and some monotone condition. In the above works, the potential
V (x) is either constant or some bounded potentials possessing some global minimum
points, the main purpose of this paper is devoted to studying the case that V (x)
possesses some local minimum points.
In the last several years, the semiclassical state of the nonlinear SchrödingerPoisson system has been object of interest for many authors. Ruiz and Vaira [38]
proved the existence of multi-bump solutions of system

−ε2 ∆u + V (x)u + K(x)φu = up in R3 ,
(1.3)
−∆φ = K(x)u2
in R3 .
with K(x) ≡ 1 and these bumps concentrate around a local minimum of the potential V . Ruiz [37] and D’Aprile and Wei [18] showed that system (1.3) with
V (x) ≡ K(x) ≡ 1 possesses a family of solutions concentrating around a sphere
when ε → 0 for p ∈ (2, 18
7 ). Their results were generalized in [24, 25] for the radial
V and K. Ianni and Vaira [26] obtained the existence of positive bound state solutions which concentrate on a non-degenerate local minimum or maximum of V by
using a Lyapunov-Schmitt reduction method. Seok [40] proved that system (1.3)
has single and multi-peak solutions which concentrate around the local minimum
of V with the Berestycki-Lions conditions. After that, Zhang [51] considered the
critical Berestycki-Lions conditions and obtained the single solutions which concentrate around the local minimum of V . Liu at el [29] proved the multi-semiclassical
states which concentrates around its corresponding global minimum point of V .
The concentration phenomenon of solutions for the following Schrödinger-Poisson
system also investigated by some authors:

−ε2 ∆u + V (x)u + λφu = f (x, u) in R3 ,
(1.4)
−ε2 ∆φ = u2
in R3 .
For the subcritical case, When f (x, u) = b(x)f (u) and f satisfies super-4 growth
condition and some monotone condition, Wang et al. [49] studied the existence of
ground state solutions for system (1.4) and the concentration behavior of least energy solutions was obtained. For the critical growth case, He and Zou [23] considered
the existence and concentration behavior of ground state solutions for (1.4) with
f (x, u) = u5 + f (u) and the subcritical term f the so-called Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz
condition, they proved that system (1.4) has a ground state solution concentrating
around a global minimum V as ε → 0. When f (x, u) = λ|u|p−2 u + |u|4 u with
3 < p ≤ 4, which it does not satisfy the monotone assumption or AmbrosettiRabinowtiz condition, He and Li [21] construct a family of positive solution which
concentrates around a local minimum of V as ε → 0.

But, to the best of knowledge, for the local case, only in [21, 40, 51], the authors
considered the the potential V (x) possessing a local minimum point. They followed
the method developed by Byeon-Jeanjean [10, 11] to construct a peak or multiplepeak solution which concentrates on the local minimum of V (x) as ε → 0. For the
nonlocal case, there are no papers to consider the potential V (x) possessing a local
minimum point. Motivated by some related works, the aim of this paper is to study
the existence of concentration solutions in the case that V (x) has local minimum
points. We will take the penalization arguments due to del Pino and Felmer [35]
to investigate system (1.1). As we know, this kind of penalization method has
been successfully applied to study the multiplicity and concentration of solutions
for other problems, such as: Kirchhoff type problems [22], fractional Schrödinger
equations [1], quasilinear problem involving N -Laplacian [2], quasilinear Choquard
equation [3] and so on. However, now we are working with a class of non-local
problems, there are some new difficulties in dealing with the system (1.1). One
of the main difficulties is that we consider the system (1.1) being with critical
Sobolev exponent, it is required to use the concentration-compactness principle to
return the compactness, but in [36], the authors provided a version of concentrationcompactness principle which is useful for the bounded domain, and here our problem
is set on the whole space R3 . This is the first obstacle to be killed. Another is the
decay estimate of solution sequence at infinity, this is different from the classical
one, such as (1.4). These difficulties make us more careful analysis, which permit
us to use the penalization method.
Our main results are as follows.
Theorem 1.1. Let 2s + 2t > 3, s, t ∈ (0, 1) and s > 34 . Suppose that V satisfies
(V0 ), (V1 ) and f ∈ C(R+ , R) satisfies (f0 )-(f2 ). Then there exists an ε0 > 0 such
that system (1.1) possesses a positive solution (uε , φε ) ∈ Hε × Dt,2 (R3 ) for all
ε ∈ (0, ε0 ). Moreover, uε possesses a maximum xε ∈ Λ such that V (xε ) → inf V as
Λ

ε → 0, and
uε (x) ≤

Cε3+2s
C0 ε3+2s + |x − xε |3+2s

x ∈ R3 , and ε ∈ (0, ε0 )

for some constants C > 0 and C0 ∈ R.
By using the Lyusternik-Schnirelmann category, we can obtain the multiplicity
of positive solutions. For this purpose, we also need the assumption that
(V2 ) M = {x ∈ Λ | V (x) = inf3 V } 6= ∅.
R

(1.5)

We denote the closed δ-neighborhood of the set M by
Mδ = {x ∈ R3 | dist(x, M) ≤ δ}.
Also we recall that, if Y is a closed set of a topological space X, catX (Y ) is the
Ljusternik-Schnirelmann category of Y in X, namely the least number of closed
and contractible sets in X which cover Y . We shall prove the following multiplicity
result.
Theorem 1.2. Let 2s + 2t > 3, s, t ∈ (0, 1) and s > 43 . Suppose that V satisfies
(V0 ), (V1 ), (V2 ) and f ∈ C(R+ , R) satisfies (f0 )-(f2 ). Then, for any δ > 0 given,
there exists εδ > 0 such that, for any ε ∈ (0, εδ ), system (1.1) has at least catMδ (M)

then lim V (xε ) = inf V and

This paper is organized as follows, in section 2, we give some preliminary results
and a version of concentration-compactness principle. In section 3, we will prove the
penalization problem has a positive solution. In section 4, we will prove the limiting
problem has a positive ground state solution. In section 5, we will give a uniform
estimate for solution sequences. In section 6, we complete the proof of Theorem
1.1. Section 7 is devote to prove Theorem 1.2 by using the Lyusternik-Schnirelmann
category.
2. Variational Setting
In this section, we outline the variational framework for studying problem (1.1)
and list some preliminary Lemma which used later. In the sequel, we denote by
k · kp the usual norm of the space Lp (R3 ), the letter ci (i = 1, 2, . . .) or C denote
by some positive constants. We denote u
b the Fourier transform of u.

2.2. Formulation of Problem (1.1). It is easily seen that, just performing the
change of variables u(x) → u(x/ε) and φ(x) → φ(x/ε), and taking z = x/ε, problem
(1.1) can be rewritten as the following equivalent form

and χ(z) is a smooth function such that χ(z) = 1 on Λ, 0 ≤ χ(z) ≤ 1 on Λ\Λ′ ,
χ(z) = 0 on R3 \Λ′ , where Λ′ is a suitable open set satisfying Λ̄ ⊂ Λ′ and V (z) >
inf ξ∈Λ V (ξ) for all z ∈ Λ̄′ \Λ. It is easy to see that under the assumptions (f1 )-(f3 ),

and Jε ∈ C 1 (Hε , R).
By standard argument, the functional Jε satisfies the mountain pass geometry.
Lemma 3.1. Suppose (V0 ), (V1 ) and (f0 ) − (f2 ) hold, then the functional Jε has
the following properties:
(i) there exist α, ρ > 0 such that Jε (u) ≥ α for kukHε = ρ;
(ii) there exists e0 ∈ Hε satisfying ke0 kHε > ρ such that Jε (e0 ) < 0.
By Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 1.15 in [47] (Mountain pass theorem without PalaisSmale condition), it follows that there exists a (P S)cε sequence {un } ⊂ Hε such
that
Jε (un ) → cε and Jε′ (un ) → 0 as n → ∞,
(3.2)
where cε = inf max Jε (γ(t)) > 0. Here
γ∈Γ t∈[0,1]

Γ = {γ ∈ C([0, 1], Hε ) | γ(0) = 0, Jε (γ(1)) < 0}.
Similarly to the argument in [35, 47], by (g5 ), the equivalent characterization of cε
is given by
cε =
inf max Jε (tu) = inf Jε (u),
u∈Hε \{0} t≥0

u∈Nε

where Nε is the Nehari manifold defined as
Nε = {u ∈ Hε \{0} hJε′ (u), ui = 0}.
For author’s convenience, we give the rough proof. We state it as the following
Proposition.
Proposition 3.2.
cε =

inf

max Jε (tu) = inf Jε (u).

u∈Hε \{0} t≥0

u∈Nε

Proof. 1. For each u ∈ Hε \{0}, we claim that there exists a unique tu > 0 such
that tu u ∈ Nε . Indeed, set h(t) = Jε (tu), by (g1 ) and (g2 ), it is easy to check that
h(t) > 0 when t > 0 small and h(t) < 0 when t > 0 large. Since h ∈ C 1 (R+ , R)
and h(0) = 0, there is tu > 0 global maximum point of h(t) and h′ (t) = 0. Thus,
hJε (tu u), tu ui = 0, and tu u ∈ Nε . We see that tu > 0 is the unique positive number
such that h′ (tu ) = 0. Indeed, suppose by contradiction that there exist t1 > t2 > 0
such that h′ (t1 ) = h′ (t2 ) = 0. Then for i = 1, 2,

Proposition 3.7. The functional Jε possesses a nontrivial critical point uε ∈ Hε

max Jε (tu) = inf Jε (u)

Proof. From Lemma 3.4, up to a subsequence, we may assume that there is u :=
uε ∈ Hε such that un ⇀ u in Hε , un → u in Lrloc (R3 ) for all 1 ≤ r < 2∗s and un → u
a.e. in R3 . Lemma 3.5 and Lemma 3.6 imply that u is nontrivial. Moreover, by (iv)
of Lemma 2.1, it is easy to check that for any ϕ ∈ Hε , hJε′ (un ), ϕi → hJε′ (u), ϕi = 0
as n → ∞, that is u is a nontrivial critical point of Jε . Next, we show that

The main result of this section is stated as follows.
Proposition 4.1. Suppose that f satisfies (f0 )-(f2 ), then autonomous problem
(4.1) has a positive ground state solution u ∈ H s (R3 ) ∩ C 2,α (R3 ), such that Iµ (u) =
cµ , where

and

n
Γµ = γ ∈ C([0, 1], H s (R3 ))

o
γ(0) = 0, Iµ (γ(1)) < 0 .

For proving Proposition 4.1, we will shoe the following preliminary results.
Lemma 4.2. Iµ possesses the mountain pass geometry:
(i) there exist ρ0 , α0 > 0 such that Iµ (u) ≥ α0 for all u ∈ H s (R3 ) with kwk = ρ0 ;
(ii) there exists u0 ∈ H s (R3 ) such that Iµ (u0 ) < 0.

FRACTIONAL SCHRÖDINGER-POISSON SYSTEM

Similar argument to Lemma 3.3, we can obtain the estimate of cµ .
Lemma 4.3. Suppose (f0 ) − (f2 ) hold, then cµ satisfies
s 3
0 < cµ < Ss2s ,
3
∗
where Ss is the best Sobolev constant for the embedding Ds,2 (R3 ) ֒→ L2s (R3 ).
We can prove the following compactness condition.
Lemma 4.4. Let {un } be a (P S)c sequence for functional Iµ , then for any c ∈
3

(0, 3s Ss2s ), under a translation, the sequence {un } strongly convergence in H s (R3 ).
Proof. Suppose {un } ⊂ H s (R3 ) satisfies
Iµ (un ) → c,

Iµ′ (un ) → 0

as n → ∞.

(4.2)

It follows from (f1 )-(f2 ) and (4.2) that

Thus {un } is bounded in H s (R3 ). Similar argument to the proof of Lemma 3.5, we
can obtain the bounded sequence {un } is nonvanishing, i.e., there exist a sequence

BR0 (xn )

Up to a subsequence, we may assume that there is u ∈ H s (R3 ) such that un ⇀ u
in H s (R3 ). By (4.3), we can assume that u 6= 0. Indeed, if u = 0, then un ⇀ 0 in
H s (R3 ) and un → 0 (otherwise, contradicts with c > 0). Set vn (x) = un (x + xn ),
then {vn } is also a (P S)c sequence for Iµ , so {vn } is bounded in H s (R3 ) and
there exists v ∈ H s (R3 ) such that vn ⇀ v in H s (R3 ), vn → v in Lrloc (R3 ) for
all 1 ≤ r < 2∗s and vn → v a.e. in R3 . By (iv) of Lemma 2.1, we have that
hIµ′ (vn ), ϕi → hIµ′ (v), ϕi = 0 for any ϕ ∈ H s (R3 ). Clearly, hIµ′ (v), vi = 0.
Next we only need to show that vn → v in H s (R3 ). By the weakly semi-lower
continuity of norm, we have that
lim inf kvn k ≥ kvk.

(4.4)

In order to prove that (4.4) hold, we must show the equality holds in (4.4). Otherwise, by Fatou’s Lemma, we get

which is a contradiction. Thus, up to a subsequence, using Brezis-Lieb Lemma, we
conclude that vn → v in H s (R3 ).
Proof of Proposition 4.1. From Lemma 4.2, and using the mountain-pass
Lemma without (P S) condition, we get a (P S)cµ sequence {un } ⊂ H s (R3 ). By
Lemma 4.3 and Lemma 4.4, under a translation, still denoted by {un }, there is
u ∈ H s (R3 ) such that un → u in H s (R3 ). Therefore, Iµ (u) = cµ and Iµ′ (u) = 0,
i.e., u ∈ H s (R3 ) is a weak solution of problem (4.1). By standard argument to the
proof Proposition 4.4 in [46], we have that u ∈ C 2,α (R3 ) for some α ∈ (0, 1). The
remain proof is to show u is positive. Using −u− as a testing function, it is easy to
see that u ≥ 0. Since u ∈ C 2,α (R3 ), by Lemma 3.2 in [34], we have that
Z
1
u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)
(−∆)s u(x) = − C(s)

2
|x − y|3+2s
R3
Assume that there exists x0 ∈ R3 such that u(x0 ) = 0, then from u ≥ 0 and u 6≡ 0,
we get
Z
u(x0 + y) + u(x0 − y)
1
dx dy < 0.
(−∆)s u(x0 ) = − C(s)
2

∗

However, observe that (−∆)s u(x0 ) = −µu(x0 )−(φtu u)(x0 )+f (u(x0 ))+u(x0 )2s −1 =
0, a contradiction. Hence, u(x) > 0, for every x ∈ R3 . The proof is completed. 

6. Proof of Theorem 1.1.
For ε > 0, let uε be the mountain-pass solution to (3.1) given by Proposition
3.7. For any sequence {εn } satisfying εn → 0+ , denote by un := uεn , Jn := Jεn
and Hn := Hεn . Then un satisfies
(−∆)s un + V (εn z)un + φtun un = g(εn z, un ) z ∈ R3 .

(6.1)

Here un is a critical point of Jn and Jn (un ) = cεn . Using Lemma 4.5, and similar
argument to the proof of Lemma 3.4, we have that {un } is bounded in Hn . Similar
to Lemma 3.5, we have
Lemma 6.1. There exist a sequence {yn } ⊂ R3 and R > 0, β > 0 such that
Z
u2n dz ≥ β.
BR (yn )

Lemma 6.2. {εn yn } is bounded in R3 . Moreover, dist(εn yn , Λ′ ) ≤ εn R.
Proof. For δ > 0, define Kδ = {z ∈ R3 | dist(z, Λ′ ) ≤ δ}. Let ϕεn (z) = ϕ(εn z)
satisfy that ϕ ∈ C ∞ (R3 , [0, 1]), ϕ = 1 on R3 \Kδ , ϕ = 0 on Λ′ and |∇ϕ| ≤ Cδ .
Noting that suppϕεn ∩ (Λ′ /εn ) = ∅, then g(εn z, un )un ϕεn = f˜(un )un ϕεn . Taking
un ϕεn as a test function in (6.1), by (g3 ), similar argument to Lemma 3.6, we have

We claim that for small εn > 0, there exists yn′ such that εn yn′ ∈ Kδ and |yn′ − yn | ≤

which contradicts with Lemma 6.1. Thus the claim follows. Moreover,
dist(εn yn , Λ′ ) ≤ |εn yn − εn yn′ | + dist(εn yn′ , Λ′ ) ≤ εn R + δ.
By the arbitrariness of δ, we complete the proof.



By Lemma 6.2, we see that lim dist(εn yn , Λ′ ) = 0, hence, there is a subsequence

of {εn yn }, still denoted by εn yn and x0 ∈ Λ′ such that lim εn yn = x0 . Set

Lemma 6.3. x0 ∈ Λ.

Proof. It suffices to show that V (x0 ) = V0 . If this fact is proved, by (V1 ) and the
definition of Λ′ , we see that x0 6∈ ∂Λ and x0 6∈ Λ′ /Λ, then x0 ∈ Λ.
Now, clearly, V (x0 ) ≥ V0 . The remain is to prove V (x0 ) ≤ V0 . Set vn (z) =
un (z + yn ), then vn satisfies

Let cx0 be the mountain-pass energy of JeV (x0 ) . Since JeV (x0 ) (v) ≥ IV (x0 ) (v), then
cx0 ≥ cV (x0 ) . Thus, similar argument to (3.15), we get

Assume by the contrary that V (x0 ) > V0 . Denote w be a ground state critical
point of IV (x0 ) . By standard argument, there exists τ0 > 0 such that IV0 (τ0 w) =
supτ >0 IV0 (τ w). Hence,
cV0 ≤ sup IV0 (τ w) = IV0 (τ0 w) < IV (x0 ) (τ0 w) ≤ sup IV (x0 ) (τ w) = IV (x0 ) (w)
τ >0

τ >0

= cV (x0 )
which contradicts with (6.4). Thus V (x0 ) = V0 .



From V (x0 ) = V0 , we see that cV (x0 ) = cV0 . It follows from (6.4) that kvn k →
kvk. Using Brezis-Lieb Lemma, we conclude that vn → v in H s (R3 ).
Lemma 6.4. Let vn (z) = un (z + yn ) satisfies (6.2). Then
uniformly for n ∈ N.

lim vn (z) = 0

|z|→∞

Proof. By Proposition 5.1, we see that there exists C > 0 independent of n such
that kvn kL∞ ≤ C. Now, we rewrite the reduced form of problem (6.1) as follows
(−∆)s vn + vn = hn (z) z ∈ R3 ,
where hn (z) := vn − V (εn z + εn yn )vn − φtvn vn + g(εn z + εn yn , vn ). Clearly, hn ∈
L∞ (R3 ) and is uniformly bounded. By interpolation inequality and vn → v in
H s (R3 ), for n → ∞, we have that hn → h in Lr (R3 ) for 2 ≤ r < +∞, where
h(z) = v(z) − V (x0 )v(z) − φtv (z)v(z) + g(x0 , v(z)). Using some results found in [20],
we see that

vn (z) =

Lemma 6.5. There is n0 > 0 such that un (z) = vn (z − yn ) < a, for all n ≥ n0
and all z ∈ R3 \(Λ/εn). Hence, vn is a solution of problem (3.1) for n ≥ n0 .
Proof. By Lemma 6.3, we see that εn yn → x0 and x0 ∈ Λ. Thus, there exists
R′ > 0 such that for some subsequence, still denoted by itself, BR′ (εn yn ) ⊂ Λ ⊂ Λ′
for all n ∈ N. Hence, BR′ /εn (yn ) ⊂ Λ/εn , ∀n ∈ N. Moreover, by Lemma 6.4, there
is R1 > 0 such that vn (z) < a for |z| ≥ R1 and ∀n ∈ N. Thus,
un (z) = vn (z − yn ) < a,

for all z ∈ R3 \BR1 (yn ) and ∀n ∈ N

Hence, there exists n0 ∈ N such that
R3 \(Λ′ /εn ) ⊂ R3 \(Λ/εn ) ⊂ R3 \BR′ /εn (yn ) ⊂ R3 \BR1 (yn ),

∀n ≥ n0

and then
un (z) < a

∀z ∈ R3 \(Λ/εn ) and ∀ n ≥ n0 .


Proof of Theorem 1.1. By Proposition 3.7, we see that problem (3.1) has a
nonnegative solution vε for all ε > 0. From Lemma 6.5, there exists ε0 > 0 such
that
vε (z) < a ∀z ∈ R3 \(Λ/ε) and ε ∈ (0, ε0 )

which implies that g(εz, vε ) = f (vε ) + vε s

for all ε ∈ (0, ε0 ). Let uε (x) = vε (x/ε) for every ε ∈ (0, ε0 ), it follows that uε must
be a solution to original problem (1.1) for ε ∈ (0, ε0 ).

If zε denotes a global maximum point of vε , then

Hence we get a contradiction owing to the choosing k > 2. In view of Lemma 6.4,
we see that {zε } is bounded for ε ∈ (0, ε0 ).
In what follows, setting xε = εzε + εyε , where {yε } is given in Lemma 6.1. Since
uε (x) = vε ( xε − yε ), then xε is a global maximum point of uε and uε (xε ) ≥ a for all
ε ∈ (0, ε0 ).
Now, we claim that lim V (xε ) = V0 . Indeed, if the above limit does not hold,
ε→0+

there is εn → 0+ and γ0 > 0 such that
V (xεn ) ≥ V0 + γ0
By Lemma 6.4, we know that

∀n ∈ N.

(6.8)

lim vεn (z) = 0 uniformly in n ∈ N. From

|z|→∞

(6.7), thus {zεn } is a bounded sequence. Up to a subsequence, using Lemma 6.3,
we know that there is x0 ∈ Λ such that V (x0 ) = V0 and εn yεn → x0 . Hence,
xεn = εn zεn + εn yεn → x0 which implies that V (xεn ) → V (x0 ) = V0 contradicting
with (6.8).
To complete the proof, we only need to prove the decay properties of uε . Similar
argument to the proof of Lemma 5.6 in [46], we can obtain that

Let us consider δ > 0 such that Mδ ⊂ Λ and a smooth cut-off function with

such that

 un ⇀ u in Hε ,
un → u in Lrloc (R3 ) for 1 ≤ r < 2∗s ,
(7.3)

un → u a.e. R3 .
By standard computation, we can assume that there exists {λn } ⊂ R such that
Jε′ (un ) = λn Gε′ (un ) + o(1),
where Gε (u) = hJε′ (u), ui. Moreover, since un ∈ Nε , we know that
0 = hJε′ (un ), un i = λn hGε′ (un ), un i + o(1)kun kHε .

(7.4)

Next we will show that λn → 0 as n → ∞. Indeed, by the fact that ( fτ(τ3 ) )′ > 0,

Thus, we may assume that hGε′ (un ), un i → l < 0. It follows from (7.4) that λn → 0
as n → ∞ and then we see that Jε′ (un ) → 0 as n → ∞ in the dual space of Hε .
Hence, {un } is a (P S)c sequence for Jε .

Now we apply Lemma 2.2 to establish (7.9). Since {un } is bounded in H s (R3 ), by
