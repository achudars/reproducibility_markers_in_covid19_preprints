We consider the problem of confining the famously elusive Dirac-like quasiparticles, as found in
some recently discovered low-dimensional systems. After briefly surveying the existing theoretical
proposals for creating bound states in Dirac materials, we study relativistic excitations with a
position-dependent mass term. With the aid of an exactly-solvable model, we show how bound
states begin to emerge after a critical condition on the size of the mass term is met. We also
reveal some exotic properties of the unusual confinement discovered, including an elegant chevron
structure of the bound state energies as a function of the size of the mass.
Keywords: Dirac materials, bound states, Dirac equation, confinement, relativistic wave equation

problems6 . For the case of massless (ultrarelativistic) particles, the situation seems even more desperate, since their governing wave equation in potential wells maps onto the Schrödinger equation for
scattering states, suggesting that the generation of
bound states is an impossible task7 .
In this work, we briefly review some of the theoretical suggestions for creating discrete states in
Dirac materials. We then propose a theory of bound
states of Dirac particles with a position-dependent
mass term. Guided by an exactly-solvable model,
we reveal how bound states first appear (at zero
energy) at a threshold strength of the mass term;
and how further bound states appear regularly in a
remarkable chevron pattern. We also characterize,
with a brief equation, the number of bound states
in the system as a function of the size of the mass.

1. On the problem of charge
confinement
Since the discovery of graphene in 2004, the exciting field of Dirac materials (those which host excitations who obey a version of Dirac’s relativistic
equation for the electron) was born1 2 3 . These exotic materials, where relativistic quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics merge in a nontrivial way, are a playground for groundbreaking
fundamental discoveries, as well as for the next generation of electronic devices4 .
A key issue to address when considering the
electronic properties of Dirac materials is how to
confine their relativistic charge carriers. This is
because these quasi-particles exhibit Klein (chiral) tunneling effects5 , leading to high transmission probabilities in standard potential step barrier

Therefore, our work opens up another avenue to explore in the quest to trap Dirac-like charge carriers.
In what follows, we review some theoretical
proposals which enable bound states of Dirac particles in Sec. 2, and we introduce our theory of
bound states of relativistic particles with a positiondependent mass in Sec. 3, before drawing some brief
conclusions in Sec. 4.

2. Some previous proposals to bind
relativistic particles
Here we briefly outline some theoretical proposals
for achieving bound states in Dirac materials8 9 .
We focus on four principle themes: trapping in magnetic fields in Sec. 2.1; confinement of zero energy
states in electric fields in Sec. 2.2; bound states due
to precise Fermi velocity engineering in Sec. 2.3; and
finally we discuss the crucial role of the mass term
in Sec. 2.4.

exploit the fact that the pseudospin, the conserved
quantity which allows for perfect chiral transmission, is ill-defined at the apex of the Dirac cone,
that is, precisely at zero energy. The experimental
signatures of zero energy bound states have been recently reported in groundbreaking measurements30
31 .

2.3. Fermi velocity engineering
It has been put forward that Dirac particles may
also be confined by so-called velocity barriers32 .
This term refers to barriers formed by a region of
one Fermi velocity surrounded by a region of a different Fermi velocity, leading to an exotic form of
trapping potential. A succession of theoretical papers have described the scattering and bound state
solutions in such circumstances33 34 35 , which may
arise in certain strain configurations of the Dirac
material, as shown in the latest experimental work
36 .

2.1. Magnetic fields
Perhaps the simplest method to bring about the ondemand confinement of Dirac particles is through
the application of magnetic fields perpendicular to
the Dirac material. Of course, a constant magnetic
field profile leads to the emergence of relativistic
Landau levels and the quantum Hall effect10 . Socalled magnetic quantum dots,11 where the magnetic field is spatially inhomogeneous, have also
been considered recently and shown to lead to the
formation of bound states,12 13 albeit under some
quite strict criteria for the decay strength of the
magnetic field14 15 . The experimental realization
of magnetic quantum dots in Dirac materials is an
open task.

2.2. Electric fields
Confinement in quantum dots formed by potential
wells has been extensively studied16 17 18 . For massive particles, bound states are allowed despite the
Klein phenomenon, as has been shown by a plethora
of exact solutions of Dirac-like equations in various potential wells 19 20 21 22 . However, the situation is very different for massless particles23 24 .
Then the Klein tunneling always succeeds and only
quasi-bound states may form. However, a series of
works has shown truly bound states may form at
zero-energy, both in two-dimensional25 26 27 and
one-dimensional28 29 Dirac materials. These works

2.4. Inducing a mass term
It has already been mentioned in Sec. 2.2 that confinement in quantum dots is much easier when the
Dirac particles are massive, that is, when the Hamiltonian contains a term proportional to the third
Pauli matrix σz . Alternatively, if one is dealing
with massless particles, one may employ the socalled Berry-Mondragon (or infinite-mass) boundary condition37 . This condition may confine ultrarelativistic excitations to a specific small region,
outside of which their mass is considered infinite.
Such a condition has wide applications in the latest nanoribbon and nanotube research, where edge
termination is of particular importance38 39 40 .

3. Bound states of Dirac particles
with a position-dependent mass
Here we consider Dirac particles in one-dimension
with a spatially inhomogeneous mass term, in a
theoretical framework outlined in Sec. 3.1. Bound
states of quantum particles with a position dependent mass have been studied before, predominately
in the context of non relativistic systems41 42 43 ,
but also in the relativistic regime44 . Here we show
some remarkable properties of bound states of relativistic particles with a position-dependent mass,
with the aid of an elegant exactly-solvable model
introduced in Sec. 3.2.

Trapping charge carriers in low-dimensional Dirac semimetals

3.1. The Hamiltonian
The Hamiltonian of a massive relativistic particle
in a one-dimensional Dirac material reads
H = vF px σx + mvF2 σz ,

(1)

where the Fermi velocity vF plays the role of the
speed of light c from Dirac’s theory, px is the momentum operator and m is the quasiparticle mass.
In Eq. (1), σx,z are Pauli’s first and third spin matrices respectively. The Hamiltonian (1) describes
Dirac particles with the famous relativistic spectrum
q
2
(2)
E = ± mvF2 + (vF px )2 ,

where ± alludes to electron and hole-like quasiparticles, which mimics the electron and positron symmetry from Dirac’s original theory of the relativistic
electron. Let us now consider a position dependent
mass,
m = m(x),

(3)

in the 2 × 2 matrix Hamiltonian (1), which leads to
the Schrödinger equation


ψA (x)
HΨ = EΨ, Ψ(x) =
,
(4)
ψB (x)
where the wavefunction Ψ is a two-component column vector, reflecting the pseudospin of the system.
Therefore, one is presented with the following system of two coupled ordinary differential equations
to be solved
d
ψB = (ε − ∆(x)) ψA ,
(5a)
dx
d
ψA = (ε + ∆(x)) ψB ,
(5b)
dx
where the reduced energy is ε = E/~vF and the
reduced mass profile function is ∆(x) = mvF /~.
Switching the dependent variables with the relations ψ1,2 = ψA ± ψB , leads to the new system of
equations


ψ1 = ∆(x)ψ2 ,
(6a)
dx



ψ2 = ∆(x)ψ1 ,

which are in a convenient form for further calculations. Indeed, it is straightforward to show that
Eq. (6) admit analytic solutions for a variety of
band-gaps profiles ∆(x), including functional forms
known from other studies45 46 , and we will revisit
such solutions in a future work. From now on, we

3

label the total spinor wavefunction as φ = (ψ1 , ψ2 )
and consider a specific ∆(x).

3.2. The model
We consider a mass term changing exponentially in
space, modeled with the symmetric reduced bandgap function
∆(x) = ∆0 e−

|x|
d ,

(7)

where ∆0 is the maximal strength of the band-gap
and d is the length scale over which the band-gap
decays.
We begin by considering the system of equations Eq. (6) with the mass-profile (7) in the halfspace x > 0. Upon eliminating ψ2 , the second-order
differential equation governing ψ1 is given by


− ε − d ψ1 (x) = 0,
ψ1 (x) + d ψ1 (x) + ∆0 e
(8)
where the prime denotes taking a derivative with
respect to x. Changing the independent variable to
x

z = e− d ,
leads to the transformation of Eq. (8) into


ψ100 (z) + [∆0 d]2 − εd[1+εd]
ψ1 (z) = 0,
2
z

(9)

(10)

where the prime now refers to the new variable z,
and where the term proportional to ψ10 has been
eliminated. In Eq. (10), the ansatz
√
(11)
ψ1 (z) = zf (z),
gives rise to the following equation for the unknown
function f (z):


2

f 00 (z) + z1 f 0 (z) + [∆0 d]2 − [εd+1/2]
f (z) = 0.
2
z
(12)
This equation is simply Bessel’s differential equation in the scaled variable ∆0 d z, and thus has the
standard solution
f (z) = c1 Jεd+1/2 (∆0 d z)+c2 Yεd+1/2 (∆0 d z) , (13)
where Jα (ξ) and Yα (ξ) are the Bessel functions of
the first and second kinds respectively, both of order α, and c1,2 are arbitrary constants. We consider
positive energies ε > 0 for the moment, and always require ψ1 to be square-integrable, so that the
physical solution to Eq. (12) is with Jα (ξ) only.
Along with Eq. (9) and Eq. (11), this selection from
Eq. (13) completes the search for ψ1 (x) for x > 0.
Recalling the coupled equation (6), once ψ1 is
known, ψ2 directly follows from Eq. (6a). Hence

(dashed black lines). The emergence of new zero energy states at constant intervals of ∆0 d = π/2 [c.f.
Eq. (18)], leads to a neat classification of the total
number of bound states N for a system with some
finite ∆0 d. The categorization reads
N = 0, ∆0 d < π4 ,
N = 1, 3, 5, ..., ∆0 d =
N = 2, 4, 6, ...,

where n+ = 0, 1, 2... and n− = 1, 2, 3... are integers
and τ is given by Eq. (16). Equation (18) simply
governs the existence of zero energy (ε = 0) bound
states at critical band-gap sizes. Away from this
limit, one may find the exact bound state energies
from the roots of Eq. (17). We note a similar equation to Eq. (17) can be derived when considering
negative energies ε < 0.
The result of standard root-finding procedures
for the eigenvalue equation (17) is shown in Fig. 1,
which displays a beautiful chevron structure. It is
immediately striking that bound states only occur
above a threshold band-gap size, given by
π
(∆0 d)threshold = ,
(19)

which is indeed a zero energy state, described by
n+ = 0 in Eq. (18). In Fig. 1, the dimensionless
eigenenergies εd are found from Eq. (17) with τ = +
(red lines) and τ = − (blue lines), as a function
of the dimensionless band-gap strength ∆0 d (scaled
by 4/π ' 1.27 for convenience). All of the bound
states fall within the region demarcated by ε = ±∆0

εd

(17)

which is the exact expression governing the allowed
eigenenergies ε of the system, as a function of the
two mass profile parameters ∆0 and d [c.f. Eq. (7)].
In the limit of small energy εd  1, Eq. (17) simplifies considerably into the analytic expression

such that are no bound states (N = 0) below a
threshold band-gap strength [c.f. Eq. (19)]; there
are an odd number of bound states at critical bandgap strengths [c.f. Eq. (18)]; and otherwise there are
regions of an even number of bound states. This
scheme is marked in Fig. 1 by the critical band-gap
sizes ∆0 d = {π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4, 9π/4} (dotted
gray lines).

After imposing the continuity of both wavefunction

The results of this section highlight an underappreciated approach to bind relativistic Dirac
particles: confinement by considering a positiondependent mass profile. We have seen some remarkable properties of bound states in such systems,
via an exactly-solvable model, including the importance of a threshold strength of band-gap [c.f.
Eq. (18)], and a beautiful chevron structure of the
bound states trapped in the effective mass barrier
[c.f. Fig. 1].

4. Conclusions
We have considered the most conceptually simple
problem associated with Dirac-like charge carriers
in the emerging field of Dirac materials: how can
one confine and manipulate such elusive particles?

Trapping charge carriers in low-dimensional Dirac semimetals

We have briefly reviewed some theoretical literature
on the topic of charge confinement low-dimensional
Dirac materials, including the use of magnetic and
electric fields, Fermi velocity engineering and the
introduction of a mass term.
We have shown, through an analytic model,
that Dirac particles with a position-dependent mass
profile are able to be confined in certain situations. We have detailed the properties of such
bound states, including how they form a remarkable
chevron structure. Our work paves the way for more
sophisticated theoretical studies of low-dimensional
Dirac systems which host excitations with spatially
inhomogeneous mass profiles, with the eventual aim
of experimental detection of the novel bound states
predicted in this work.
