Abstract
Simultaneous measurements of sea spray aerosol (SSA), wind, wave, underwater acoustic
noise, and microwave brightness temperature are obtained in the open ocean. These data are
analyzed to clarify the ocean surface processes important to SSA production. Parameters are
formulated to represent surface processes with characteristic length scales over a broad range, from
tens of meters to a few centimeters. The result shows that the correlation coefficients between SSA
properties (number, volume and flux) and surface process parameters improve toward the shortest
length scale. This suggests that whereas surface wave breaking is a necessary initial and boundary
condition, the final state of the atmospheric SSA properties is controlled primarily by turbulent
processes characterized by the ocean surface roughness. The investigation also reveals distinct
differences of the SSA properties in rising winds and falling winds, with higher efficiency of
breaking production in low or falling winds. Previous studies show that the length scale of breaking
waves is shorter in mixed seas than in wind seas. Combining the observations together, it is
suggestive that larger air cavities are entrained in rising winds (with wind seas more likely). The
larger air cavities escape before they can be fully broken down into small bubbles for the
subsequent SSA production. In contrast, the shorter breakers in low or falling winds (with mixed
seas more likely) trap smaller air cavities that stay underwater longer for more efficient bubble
breakup by turbulence.

1. Introduction
The study of short-scale ocean surface roughness is of great interest to many areas of air-sea
interaction and ocean remote sensing. In some applications, the important range of roughness
length scale is very narrow. For example, spaceborne microwave scatterometer and radiometer are
the main instruments providing global measurements of ocean surface vector winds. The
microwave radar backscattering at moderate to high incidence angles are primarily contributed by
the Bragg resonance mechanism (e.g., Crombie 1955; Wright 1966, 1968) and the critical length
scale of the ocean surface roughness is similar to that of the radar waves: B  r  2sin   , where
1

 is wavelength,  is incidence angle, and subscript B stands for Bragg resonance and r for radar.
The longer surface waves also play a secondary role to backscattering through tilting the roughness
patches, especially at the two ends of the incidence angle range, e.g., see Figs. 6-7 in Valenzuela
(1978) and Fig. 2 in Hwang et al. (2013). This represents one extreme of the narrowness of critical
roughness length scale. For instance, at 45 incidence angle, the L-, C-, X- and Ku-band (~1.4,
5.5, 10, 14 GHz) Bragg wavelengths are 0.15, 0.039, 0.021 and 0.015 m. Their response to wind
forcing and modification by other environmental parameters such as longer scale waves and
currents are different, thus we can expect different degrees of sensitivity in the retrieval of
geophysical parameters such as wind speed, surface current and wave properties using radar
backscattering of different frequency bands.
For some processes, the range of important roughness length scale is broader. For example,
in the passive microwave radiometer measurement of ocean surface emission, the contributing
bandwidth of surface waves extends to a factor of about 3~10 times shorter and longer than the
electromagnetic (EM) wavelength depending on the incidence angle, e.g., see Figs. 1-3 of Johnson
and Zhang (1999).

Similar to remote sensing processes, in air-sea interaction, several studies have shown that the
correlation of gas transfer velocity with ocean surface mean square slope (MSS) integrated over
some range of wavenumber k is considerably better than its correlation with wind speed (e.g., Bock
et al. 1999; Frew et al. 2004, 2007). Frew et al. (2004) quantify the difference with field data:
referenced to the wind-speed correlation coefficient of about 0.77, the MSS correlation coefficient
improves from 0.81 (k range 40-100 rad m-1) to 0.92 (k range 400-800 rad m-1).
In a recent paper, Savelyev et al. (2014), referred to as S14 in the following, present an analysis
of SSA measurement onboard the Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP) conducted by the Naval
Research Laboratory (Breaking Wave Experiment: BREWEX). Among the reported results is the total
sea spray source flux (SSSF) F integrated over the range of dry radius between 0.5 and 12 m.
Referenced to the wind speed, the F seems to separate into two or more distinct populations. A
significant improvement in bringing the multiple populations together is achieved when the F is
plotted against the roughness component of the microwave (10.7 GHz) brightness temperature Tb.
They hypothesize that the observation may suggest that the processes important to SSA generation are
probably better characterized by the short scale ocean surface roughness, although the exact physical
mechanisms remain to be identified.
In this paper, we continue exploring the length scale issue of ocean processes important to SSA
production. In addition to wind and microwave brightness temperature measurements, the BREWEX
data suite includes surface waves obtained by a pressure sensor at 3 to 5 m depth and underwater
acoustic noise in the frequency range between 300 and 2400 Hz. The acoustic system is a 32-element
vertical hydrophone array with an 18.75-m aperture and the top element is at 9 m below the mean water
surface. Unfortunately, the low frequency portion -- less than 1200 Hz -- is contaminated by the noise

from the FLIP so only the high frequency portion is used in this study.
The dynamic pressure of wave motion decays exponentially away from the interface, therefore
JPO/31Oct2014

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

the useful surface wave signal is limited to wavelengths longer than about twice the sensor depth (6 to
10 m minimum wavelength in the present case). Wave-induced acoustic noise is likely produced at the
instant of bubble detachment or splitting (“screaming infant microbubbles”) (e.g., Pumphrey 1989;
Prosperetti et al. 1989; Medwin and Beaky 1989; Pumphrey and Elmore 1990; Longue-Higgins 1992;
Medwin and Clay 1998). The underwater acoustic noise measurement therefore captures the bubbleentraining wave breaking, with dominant length scale of probably a few meters, as estimated from the

first moment of the breaking front statistics characterizing the ocean surface whitecap coverage
(Phillips 1985) and the velocity and length scales derived from analyses of radar sea spikes (Frasier
et al. 1998; Hwang 2007; Hwang et al. 2008a, b).
Considering wind as the common driving force, the observations of microwave brightness
temperature, acoustic noise and surface waves thus serve as proxies of processes responding to surface
roughness of three distinctive ranges of length scale, respectively, a few centimeters, a few meters and
tens of meters and longer. For brevity, we denote the three ranges as O(0.01 m), O(1 m) and O(10 m)
in the remainder of this paper. Our analysis shows that the correlation coefficients between SSA
properties and the process proxies improve toward the shortest length scale. Also, by sorting the data
into rising wind, falling wind, and quasi-steady categories, there is a clear episodic behavior of the
SSA dependence on the windsea energy dissipation rate Et. The efficiency of SSA production by wave
breaking is much better in low or falling winds than in rising winds. A plausible explanation of these
two primary results (short scale roughness and breaking efficiency) has been summarized in the
abstract and the analyses leading to the explanation are described in this paper.
In the following, Sec. 2 gives a brief recapitulation of the experiment; a detailed description

has been presented in S14. Sec. 3 describes the results of the suite of measurements: wind, wave,
SSA, brightness temperature and underwater acoustic noise. These measurements are then combined
to explore the mechanisms of SSA generation and distribution. Sec. 4 discusses the issues of

roughness scales, breaking efficiency and the implication on air-sea interaction processes in
general and SSA generation in particular, and Sec. 5 is a summary.
2. Experiment
The Breaking Wave Experiment (BREWEX) is conducted onboard the free-drifting FLIP in the
Pacific Ocean about 200 km west of California coast from 17 April to 3 May 2012 (Day 108 to 124, 1
Jan being Day 1). The overall goal of the experiment is to conduct a variety of collocated measurements
aimed at identifying specific signatures of active and residual phases of oceanic whitecaps utilizing
visible, infrared, microwave, as well as acoustic sensing. The first results of the BREWEX data analysis
on SSA and passive microwave emissions from the ocean surface are presented in S14. The analysis
focuses on the later period when the wind turned to be from north and stayed northerly for the next
four days (Day 118 to 122) and the SSA is not contaminated by the land or surf sources.
Figure 1 depicts the trajectory of the FLIP, highlighted in dark color is the duration of the northerly
wind. Also shown in the figure are the locations of four National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys
used to compare with the wind and wave measurements onboard FLIP. The depth of the pressure sensor
for surface wave measurements is initially at 3 m but lowered to 4 then 5 m in the later part of the
experiment as wind and wave increase. The pressure signal is sampled at 10 Hz but the exponential
decay of the dynamic wave-induced pressure signal places the upper limit of the useful frequency range
at about 0.4 Hz, similar to that of the NDBC buoys. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the measurements of wind
speed and wave properties (significant wave height Hs and spectral peak wave period Tp) are in general
agreement with the NDBC buoys. A motion sensor package is installed to measure the six degrees of
the FLIP motion. The analysis of several data segments during high sea state shows that the wave
spectral correction is on the order of a few percent at most, consistent with earlier analyses of the FLIP
motions. For example, Smith and Rieder (1997) conclude that “... The resultant wind stress

contribution is … more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the measured wind stresses.

JPO/31Oct2014

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

Indeed, FLIP is a stable platform.” The motion correction is therefore not performed in our wind
and wave measurements.
For the FLIP data, the significant wave height Hs is computed as four times the square root of

the elevation variance from integrating the wave spectrum, which is calculated from the pressure
signal with the exponential decay correction. The peak wave period Tp is obtained using Young’s
(1995) algorithm:

p

  S   d  ,

 S   d 

where  is angular frequency 2T-1, T is wave period, S is spectrum, and subscript p indicates the

value at spectral peak. The peak period obtained from the spectral integration method is less noisy
compared to simply picking the maximum component of the spectrum or several other designs of
peak frequency computation; the detail is discussed in Young (1995). Although there are differences
in the fine details between the FLIP and NDBC time series because of the spatial separation (several
hundred km apart), the large scale features are similar in all measurements.
The durations of FLIP wind and wave recordings are (time) t = 113.02-121.81 d and 114.90121.67 d, respectively. In Fig. 2, the 10-min average results are merged together and interpolated to
the same reference time of the latter period. The buoy data are reported hourly with wave spectrum
computed from 20 min data and wind averaged over 8 min. As discussed in Sec. 1, the wind turned to
be from the north on Day 117. For the remaining period of the experiment, the wind direction remains
steady and U10 varies from 1.9 to 15.6 m s-1 with some fluctuation. The wave condition is expected to
change from swell-dominant in low winds to windsea-dominant in high winds. The significant wave
height Hs exceeds 4 m during the high wind period, the minimum Hs is 0.98 m (Fig. 2c).

3. Results
3.1. Wind-wave energy dissipation
To emphasize the relevance to wave breaking, the combination of wind and wave data is
represented by the windsea energy dissipation rate (Hwang and Sletten 2008; Hwang 2009). The

separation of windsea and swell components is based on the spectrum integration method (Hwang
et al. 2012). The result of applying the method to the FLIP data is shown on the left column of Fig.
3: (a) displays the time-frequency spectral plot; (b) the significant wave heights of the windsea and
swell components; and (c) the peak wave periods of the windsea and swell components. There is
a gap (the dark band in the spectral plot of Fig. 3a) in the wave data between t = 118.043 and
118.143 d when the pressure sensor depth is adjusted from 3 m to 4 m to prevent breaching.
Another adjustment to 5 m is done near t = 119 d without stopping data recording. The time series
of wind speed and windsea peak frequency fpw obtained from swell-sea separation are
superimposed on the wave spectrum plot (Fig. 3a) to show the complex evolution of surface wave
spectrum in response to fluctuating wind forcing.
The windsea component of the wave spectrum is used to estimate the spectrally integrated
energy dissipation rate attributed to wave breaking (Hwang and Sletten 2008):
Et  aU103 , with   0.20#3.3# ,

(2)

where  a is air density (about 1.22 kg m-3), #   pU10 g 1 is the dimensionless peak frequency,
2
#  rms
g 2U104 is the dimensionless windsea elevation variance, U10 is reference wind speed,  p

is the windsea spectral peak frequency, rms is the root mean squares (rms) surface elevation of
the wind sea spectrum, and g is the gravitational acceleration.
The estimated wave energy dissipation rate is shown in Fig. 3d. The results displays the
expected feature of low energy dissipation in swell-dominant or low wind periods (e.g., t < 118 d)

JPO/31Oct2014

and high dissipation in younger sea and high winds (these two factors are closely correlated and
will be further discussed in the next paragraph). Note that the total wave height Hs includes windsea
and swell components and may not always be a good indicator of energy dissipation. For example,
the trends of Hs and Et in the periods 117.5-118 d and 120+ d are noticeably different (Fig. 3d). In
general, in a sustained increasing wind event, Hs and Et grow steadily following the same trend.
Passing the peak wind speed and in the falling wind phase of the event, Hs continues to grow for
a few hours due to nonlinear energy transfer but Et, being the property of the active wind-generated
waves, would decay at the pace of U10 (Figs. 3d and 3e).
For our deep water wave condition, the dimensionless frequency # is also the inverse wave
age U10c p1 (a younger sea corresponds to larger value in # ). For the period to be focused in this
study (t>117.5 d with northerly winds and most sensors online), # is less than 1.8. Higher wind
generally produces younger sea as expected from the slower variation of waves compared to winds
– thus U10c p1 reflects more the U10 fluctuation than the cp fluctuation (Fig. 3e). This is especially
true in the situation of low or falling winds: for the latter, waves continue to grow even after wind
passed its peak; for the former, the windsea spectrum is hidden under the strong swell and cannot
be separated.
The magnitude of Et is determined mainly by the cubic wind speed relationship (2); the 
value varies only slightly in field conditions:    4.7  1  104 a   5.6  1.2  104 (Hwang
and Sletten 2008). For low winds and windsea failed to be separated, the resulting Et estimate may
bias high or low depending on the mixed wave conditions. Based on our experience, the Et
calculation of field data for U10 < 5 m s-1 is generally impacted by the difficulty in separating
windsea and swell, especially in swell dominant conditions. Using the approximate  formula

above, the corresponding Et is less than  7.0  1.5  102 W m-2 for U10 < 5 m s-1. Previous
analyses of field data show a sharp Et dropoff at U10 less than about 5 to 7 m s-1 (Hwang and
Sletten 2008; Hwang 2009).
3.2. Brightness temperature
Microwave emission from the ocean surface is modified by the roughness and white foam
produced by breaking waves (e.g., Hollinger 1971; Smith 1988). Because both ocean surface
roughness and wave breaking are closely associated with wind speed, it has been used for ocean
surface wind retrieval since the 1970’s and an extensive body of literature exists (e.g., Wentz 1975;
Ulaby et al. 1981; Wentz et al. 1986; Yueh 1994a, b, 1995; Johnson and Zhang 1999; Johnson
2006). A short discussion has been given in S14. Here we only show the processing result. The
frequency of the microwave radiometer is 10.7 GHz operated in both horizontal and vertical
polarizations. It is placed at about mid-point of the FLIP’s port-side 18-m boom and points at 45
toward the ocean surface.
For geophysical applications, the surface emissivity is frequently represented by the
brightness temperature Tb, which is the product of emissivity ep and surface temperature Ts:
Tbp  e pTs , where subscript p is polarization (H or V for horizontal or vertical). The measured Tbp

is composed of the flat surface emission Tbp0 and a small correction Tbp contributed by wind and
wave disturbances of the flat sea surface. There have been many algorithms established to compute
the emissivity of unperturbed fresh or sea water (e.g., Klein and Swift 1977; Meissner and Wentz
2004). For the typical salinity (35 psu) and surface temperature (13 C) in our experiment, the two
algorithms mentioned above produce a slight difference of the flat surface (TbH0, TbV0): (81.4K,
139.7K) for the former and (81.8K, 140.2K) for the latter. In the remainder of this paper, the
algorithm of Meissner and Wentz (2004) is used to remove the flat surface emission from the

JPO/31Oct2014

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

measured Tbp. The separation of foam and roughness components of the brightness temperature
measurements uses the equivalent medium method described by Hwang (2012). A summary is
given in Appendix A.
Figure 4a shows all the Tbp data obtained in this experiment, each data point represents 20min average. The variation of Tbp generally tracks U10 very well and the trend is in general
agreement with theoretical predictions (see also Fig. 9 in S14). The analytical result shown in Fig.
4b is based on the SPM/SSA (small perturbation method, small slope approximation) model (e.g.,
Yueh 1994a, b, 1995; Johnson and Zhang 1999; Reul and Chapron 2001) and separates the
roughness and foam components (Hwang 2012; Appendix A). There is some apparent offset
between data and model, most likely caused by reflection of the atmospheric downwelling, which
is not corrected due to the lack of information such as detailed cloud cover, type and atmospheric
constituents. Another source of error is the usage of constant sea surface temperature (13 C) and
salinity (35 psu) for computing the flat surface value of the brightness temperature, due to the lack
of continuous measurements. The magnitude of the offset is similar to those reported in other field
experiments (e.g., Hollinger 1977; Swift 1974; Sasaki et al. 1987; Camps et al. 2004).
For the range of wind speed encountered in the Tb measurements (less than 15 m s-1), the foam
contribution is relatively minor and weakly dependent on polarization. The difference between

TbH and TbV, represented by Tb, is dominated by the roughness effect (Fig. 4c). A fringe benefit
from this difference operation is that the uncorrected atmospheric effects and errors of flat surface
emissivity computation are mostly removed because they are only weakly sensitive to polarization.
The agreement between modeled and measured Tb is very good.
3.3. Underwater acoustic noise
The close association of underwater acoustic noise and surface wind and wave conditions has

JPO/31Oct2014

11

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

been recognized for many decades (e.g., Knudsen et al. 1948; Wenz 1962). The extensive
collection of field observations have established the general rule of “5 dB per octave”: the noise
level P decreases 5 dB as frequency f doubles and increases 5 dB as wind speed doubles. The
1.7
general rule can be written as P  f ,U10  ~ f 1.7U10
. While a good rule of thumb, it is also

recognized that the underwater acoustic noise level is dependent on location, season, day or night,
biological activities, shipping, and many other correlated or uncorrelated factors (e.g., Clay and
Medwin 1977; Urick 1983, 1984; Medwin and Clay 1998).
One of the primary mechanisms of the wind-related noise is identified to be the ringing (shock
excitation) of bubble formation at the time of detaching from the entrained air cavity (Pumphrey
1989): “screaming, infant microbubble” as described by Medwin and Clay (1998, pp. 15, 334).
The high efficiency and precise resonance of underwater bubble oscillations have been fascinating
and actively-researched subjects of underwater acoustics and breaking wave studies (e.g.,
Minnaert 1933; Clay and Medwin 1977; Kerman 1984, 1988, 1993; Medwin and Beaky 1988;
Prosperetti 1988; Pumphrey 1989; Medwin and Daniel 1990; Longuet-Higgins 1991, 1992, 1993;
Crum 1995; Lamarre and Melville, 1994a, b; Buckingham and Potter 1995; Dahl and Jessup 1995;
Felizardo and Melville 1995; Melville 1996; Medwin and Clay 1998; Deane and Stokes 2002,
2006, 2010; Zhao et al. 2014; and references therein).
In this study, the acoustic noise data is obtained by a vertical hydrophone array with 32
elements configured into three center-nested apertures. The element spacing for the three apertures
are 1.25, 0.625, and 0.3125 m and yield design frequencies of 600, 1200, and 2400 Hz,
respectively. The center of each aperture is nominally 18.2 m below the surface.
The raw data of each element is sampled at 12.5 kHz. Each channel is Fast-Fourier
transformed (FFT) yielding time and frequency resolutions of 0.1 s and 10 Hz, respectively. To

reduce noise from directions other than the overhead surface, the array data is phase-processed to
listen to noise from the end-fire beam (Urick 1983, pp. 54-58).
The array is deployed vertically between the face and port booms with its axis roughly 13 m
from the hull of the FLIP. Due to the width of the end-fire beam as a function of range, lower
frequency noise generated at the FLIP hull protrudes into the end-fire beam of the array. Thus, the
data reported in this paper is limited to the frequency range between 1250 and 2350 Hz. The
acoustic energy received is normalized by the frequency-dependent cross-sectional area of the
surface spanned by the end-fire beam (circles of radii ranging between 13 m and 9 m for the
frequencies of interest here) and averaged over 100-Hz frequency bands. The modulation of the
acoustic reception surface area by the ocean waves passing over the acoustic array is found to be
insignificant even for the most severe sea state period (Appendix B).
Figure 5a shows the noise power spectra sorted by wind speed. The coefficients Af and a f
of least-squares fitted power-law function: P  f ;U10   Af f

af

are shown in Figs. 5b and 5c,

respectively. The frequency range in our data is at the boundary between shipping (10 to 1000 Hz)
and wind wave action (50 Hz to 20 kHz) and field data generally show a local peak or flattening
of the spectral shape, e.g., see the large collection discussed in Wenz (1962) and recent results of
undersea noise in hurricane conditions (Zhao et al. 2014). Experiments of acoustic noise produced
by breaking waves conducted in anechoic wave flumes (e.g., Medwin and Beaky 1989; Crum
1995) also show the leveling off of the noise spectrum near 1000 Hz. The frequency exponent a f
in our data set is close to 0 at low wind speed and gradually reduces to about -0.7 and -0.5 in mid
to high winds.
Figure 6a shows the wind speed dependence of the noise power spectral components. In the
low wind region (U10<~5 m s-1), the wind speed trend is weak, indicating that the wave-induced

noise signal is barely above the ambient background. For U10>~5 m s-1, the steady trend of
increasing with wind is clear. The coefficients AU and aU of least-squares fitted power-law
function: P U10 ; f   AUU 10aU are shown in Figs. 6b and 6c, respectively. The fitting is performed
for cases with U105 m s-1, U105 m s-1 and all wind speeds. The wind speed dependence is close
1.7
to P ~ U10
except for the low-wind group.

3.4. Aerosol properties
The study of sea spray aerosol or sea salt aerosol (SSA) is of importance to many research
areas such as air-sea mass, heat and momentum exchanges, cloud and weather, climate, and
atmospheric optical properties. An extensive survey of the subject by Lewis and Schwartz (2004)
includes more than 1800 references; the more recent reviews by O’Dowd and de Leeuw (2007)
and de Leeuw et al. (2011) feature 65 and 133 references, respectively. The extensive collective
research has shown that uncertainty of a factor of 4 to 5 is common in measuring and
parameterizing the production flux of SSA over a wide range of aerosol sizes.
Although wind speed is generally used as the starting parameterization factor, it is also
recognized that wind speed alone is inadequate to account for variations of sea state, air-sea
boundary layer stability, water temperature, surfactants, …, among many other factors that cause
quantitative changes of the SSA properties. There are many alternative parameterization functions
based on, e.g., combined wind and wave parameters, whitecaps, or bubble size spectrum (e.g., see
the reviews by Hoppel et al. 2002; Lewis and Schwartz 2004; de Leeuw et al. 2011; Ovadnevaite
et al. 2014). S14 presents a parameterization function based on the microwave radiometer

brightness temperature, and suggests using such an approach for global SSA monitoring. Here we
revisit the aerosol data collected during BREWEX. In addition to the aerosol flux given in S14,
we also present results of number and volume size distributions as well as a different calculation

JPO/31Oct2014

14

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

of the SSA flux.
The aerosol size spectra are obtained with a forward scattering spectrometer mounted on the
starboard boom of the FLIP. The location is about 7 m away from the FLIP hull and 7.3 m above
the mean water level. The detail of the measurement and data processing has been described in
S14 and only a brief summary is given here.
The optical scattering spectrometer measures the SSA spectra in 4 size ranges: (in radius r)
1.5-23.5, 1.0-16.0, 0.5-8.0, and 0.25-4.0 m. Combining the four size ranges, S14 presents the
computed sea spray source function in the dry radius rdry range of 0.51 to 12.14 m (with 0
registered in the two largest size bins – 11.09 and 12.14 m). Conversion of the measured (in situ)
particle radius ris to the dry radius with the relative humidity (RH) input uses the algorithm of
Gerber (1985), prepared as a lookup table of triplets [ ris , RH, rdry ] for each size bin of the optical
spectrometer; the RH in the table ranges from 0 to 100% in 1% increments.
The aerosol flux is computed by the product of aerosol number N(r) and its settling velocity

where vd is in m s-1, r is in m, U10 is in m s-1 and v g is evaluated at r80 : the equivalent radius at
80% RH (Lewis and Schwartz 2004, p. 283). Extensive discussions on the various formulas for

vd have been published (e.g., Sehmel 1980; Slinn and Slinn 1980; Smith et al. 1993; Hoppel et al.
2002; Lewis and Schwartz 2004) and they will not be repeated here. The approximation r80  2rdry
(Lewis and Schwartz 2004, pp. 53-54) is used for (5) and (6). As described in Appendix C, some
small difference is found between the humidity correction formula of Gerber (1985) and the
approximation formula of Lewis and Schwartz (2004). The small difference is not expected to
change the conclusions of our analyses.
Unless stated otherwise, the results are presented in terms of r80 in this paper. The subscripts
in the two different estimates of SSA flux, given as Fis and FU , may be dropped when distinction
between the two is not needed. The primary difference in these two different computations of F(r)
is in the small size range, of which the settling velocity is small and the turbulent component of
the deposition velocity (proportional to U10 ) raises considerably the magnitude of FU compared
to that of Fis .
Figures 7 show the SSA volume V, number N and flux F based on the measurements of the
first size-range of the optical scattering spectrometer (1.5-23.5 m, which results in the r80 range
of about 1.3 to 20 m) for several average wind speeds from 4 to 15 m s-1, the wind speed bin size
used in the computation is 1 m s-1. The SSA size spectrum shows a general and monotonic
increase with wind speed in all the size components in our data with an exception of the lowest

wind speed bin, of which the magnitude of the large particles appears to be abnormally high. This
is probably caused by the higher RH in some of the data segments in this low wind speed bin: the
average RH is 87% with a maximum of 96% in some segments. Condensation on the sensor intake
area causing measurement contamination may have occurred under such condition of high
humidity and low wind speed. Further discussion of the humidity influence is deferred to Sec.
4.1.d.
The SSA dependence on U10 follows the power-law relationship very well, whether in terms
of volume, number or flux (Fig. 8). The relationship, in fact, can be used to construct empirical
model functions (EMFs) for the SSA size spectra:
X  r,U10   AX  r U10

ax  r 

,

(7)

where X can be dV / d ln r , dN / d ln r or dF / d ln r . Least-squares fitted AX and a X are listed in
Table 1, and they can be expressed as polynomial functions (Fig. 9):
Y  Z   pZ 1Z 3  pZ 2 Z 2  pZ 3Z  pZ 4 ,

(8)

where Z is AX or a X , and PZ1 to PZ4 are the fitting coefficients (Table 2). The wind speed
dependence in terms of the exponent a of the power-law function (7) ranges from about 1 for
dV / d ln r , dN / d ln r or dFis / d ln r and 2 for dFU / d ln r at r=~2 m to between 4 and 5 at r=~14

m, and shows a clear trend of increasing nonlinearity with the aerosol size (Fig. 9b).
Equations (7), (8) and Table 2 complete the EMFs of the SSA volume, number and flux size
spectra; constructed with data in the radius range of 2 to 14 m and wind speeds between 5 and 15
m s-1. (Cases with U10<5 m s-1 are not used in data fitting because of their high noise. Also both
ends of the aerosol size range are excluded because after humidity adjustment, the uniform ris size
range of 1.5 to 23.5 m becomes irregular in the r80 range).

Figure 10 shows the comparison between our FU EMF computed for U10=5, 10 and 15 m s-1
and measurements processed in 51, 101 and 151 m s-1 U10 bins. The local bump in the large
size region of the lowest wind speed data is not observed in higher wind speeds. The exact cause
is not certain but may be related to the high relative humidity and low wind conditions, as
commented earlier in the discussion of Fig. 7.
Also shown in the figure are the results based on the models of Monahan et al. (1986): M86,

Our data registered much smaller spectral magnitude in the larger size bins compared to those
modeled by M86, S93 and L04. For the smaller size region in our measurements, the size spectral
magnitude is significantly impacted by the choice of deposition velocity formulas (compare Figs.
7c and 7d). The overall agreement between our data and the modeled results of M86, S93 and L04
is comparable to the agreement between different models.
The more complete formulation of the deposition velocity used in this paper compared to the
one used in S14 leads to a better agreement in the SSA flux estimates of the dry deposition method

JPO/31Oct2014

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

and the vertical gradient method. In S14, the dry deposition estimate Fis is reported to be lower
than that obtained by the vertical gradient method by a factor of about 10 to 30 depending on the
aerosol size. The vertical gradient method is described in S14 and used to estimate dF/dlnr from
vertical concentration profiles for a time period of several hours with steady wind speed of U10 =
11 m s-1 (see their Fig. 6). Those same points are shown in our Fig. 10 with asterisks. They appear
to be in much closer agreement with our estimates of the SSA flux FU . This agreement is an
additional validation of both methods, and also suggests that the dry deposition calculation FU is
more accurate than Fis .
3.5. Combining multi-sensor measurements
The simultaneous time series of 20-min average underwater acoustic noise, SSA flux, windsea
energy dissipation rate, roughness component of microwave brightness temperature, and wind
speed are displayed together in Fig. 11, in linear scale on the left column and logarithmic scale on
the right column.
Figure 11a shows two representations of underwater acoustic noise: the spectral levels at 2350
Hz and the average over the frequency range between 1250 and 2350 Hz, respectively P2350 and
P<f>. The magnitude of P<f> is slightly higher than P2350. Fig. 11b displays two estimates of the
integrated SSA flux: FU and Fis ; these integrated fluxes represent the atmospheric aerosol
loading in the ris range of 1.5 to 23.5 m. The magnitude of Fis is about 20 times smaller than
that of FU . The Et and Tb are given in Figs. 11c and d, respectively. They all follow similar
trends tracking the U10 fluctuation (Fig. 11e). Vertical reference lines are drawn in Fig. 11f
marking six wind fluctuation events (rising, falling, quasi-steady) for comparison of various
measurements. The analysis of the six events will be further detailed later. From this point on,

JPO/31Oct2014

unless stated otherwise, the underwater acoustic noise is represented by P<f>, the SSA flux is
represented by FU and subscript U may be dropped. We also show the relative humidity RH time
series in Fig. 11e. As will be seen later, some of the peculiar behavior of the SSA results coincides
with the RH variation.
The relationships between Et, P<f>, F, Tb and U10 can be represented by power-law functions
as shown in Fig. 12a. For reference, line segments with U102 , U103 and U105 are superimposed; they
also serve as partitions separating the various measurements. We are especially interested in the

Et parameter in this paper as will be further explained in the next section. Also shown in the figure
is the set of curves corresponding to the empirical relationship Et   4.7  1  104 aU103 derived
from examining several field datasets as discussed in Hwang and Sletten (2008) and Hwang
(2009). The Et dependence on wind speed is also close to cubic in the present measurements in
high winds.
The large scatter of F U10  is rather unsettling (Fig. 12a). A closer inspection reveals that
the data is constituted of several populations following similar wind speed dependence but with
different absolute magnitudes. In Fig. 12b, the temporal evolutions of P<f>, F, Et and Tb in
several interesting time segments are highlighted by different colors (increasing winds, decreasing
winds, quasi-steady; as marked by vertical line segments in Fig. 11). Comparing the results of the
consecutive rising and falling wind events of 118.1-119.25 d and 119.25-119.83 d, a “hysteresis”
in F U10  is quite obvious. A similar response lag is found in the acoustic noise and roughness
component of brightness temperature, but conspicuously mixed in the windsea energy dissipation
rate. In the high wind region in particular, the energy dissipation rate is generally less in falling
winds than in rising winds for the same wind speed. This is reasonable considering that rising

winds carry additional forcing of wind speed acceleration. But then why the reverse trend in SSA
flux, acoustic noise and surface roughness? This will be further explored (Sec. 4) after
investigating the correlation coefficients between SSA flux and several forcing parameters.
Figure 13 shows the scatter plots of F vs. U10, Et, P<f>, and Tb; the correlation coefficients
R2 are 0.72, 0.57, 0.82 and 0.90, respectively. In the following, Rxy2 represents the correlation
coefficient between variables x and y, and shorthand F for FU, U for U10, P for P<f>, and T for
2
2
Tb, thus RFU
, RFP
, … and so on. In this figure, we use only the data segments with all

measurements (F, U10, Et, P<f>, and Tb) available simultaneously: the most constraining data
series is Tb (Fig. 11). The correlation is clearly much better between F and Tb than that between
F and U10, Et or P<f>. The improvement in correlation from U10 to Tb is also observed in other
expressions of the SSA properties such as the integrated number N or volume V. Fig. 14 shows
N(U10) and V(U10) on the top row, and N(Tb) and V(Tb) on the bottom row, illustrating the
consistent increase of the correlation coefficient from U10 to Tb parameterization of the SSA
properties. The correlation between the SSA properties with Et is worse than those with U10, and
the correlation between the SSA properties and P<f> is better than those with U10 but worse than
those with Tb (Fig. 15), the trend is the same as that illustrated in Fig. 13.
The result of the correlation analysis is rather surprising considering that Et and P<f> (as well
as U10) are closely connected with wave breaking, and that bubble bursting from wave breaking
has been considered an important (or maybe the most important) source of SSA (e.g., Monahan et
al. 1986; Lewis and Schwartz 2004; de Leeuw et al. 2011). The implication seems to be that
although wave breaking is a necessary initial and boundary condition for getting the SSA into air,
the turbulent transport processes controlled by small scale surface roughness are more important

JPO/31Oct2014

21

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

in determining the final state of the SSA in the atmospheric boundary layer.
However, before settling on that conclusion, we need to examine the experimental conditions
in more detail. In particular, the driving wind is far from the ideal homogeneous and steady state
generally assumed in theoretical works, but rather a combination of typical natural fluctuations
with rising, falling and quasi-steady wind events of various durations (Fig. 11f). These are
highlighted with different colors or symbols in Fig. 12b, as well as in Figs. 13 to 15. There is also
the fluctuation of relative humidity (Fig. 11e) that seems to coincide with some of the observed
anomalies, in particular, the abnormally low values of F, N, and V during the period 118.1119.23 d (Figs. 13-15) when the RH is the lowest (Fig. 11e). We explore further the effects of
these U10 and RH variations on the result of the correlation analysis next.
4. Discussion
4.1. Efficiency of wave breaking and air-sea interaction
The result from the SSA correlation analysis (Figs. 13-15) is quite puzzling at first glance.
Specifically, when compared to the F(U10) result, the correlation deteriorates in F(Et). The Et
incorporates both wind and wave effects and represents the mechanical energy available for

that is, an improvement in the correlation between F and Et over that between F and U10, but

The counter-intuitive result is intriguing. With further examination, it turns out that the
parameterization F(Et) effectively sorts out the disparate data into several distinctive populations.
In Fig. 16a we reproduce Fig. 13b in a slightly different fashion, separating the data into three main
groups: (i) rising winds (red symbols), (ii) falling winds (blue symbols), and (iii) quasi-steady
condition (green symbol), denoted as GR, GF and GQS, respectively. With reference to Fig. 16b,

JPO/31Oct2014

22

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

which is an abridged version of Fig. 11, the three groups are: GR: rising-wind events 2R and 4R;
GF: falling-wind events 1F, 3F and 6F; and GQS: quasi-steady event 5QS; numbers 1 to 6 of the
events increase chronologically. In Fig. 13b only measurements coinciding with Tb are displayed,
whereas in Fig. 16a all coexist SSA and Et are shown; the available observations more than doubled
(increased from 128 to 288).
Several features become immediately apparent from the F(Et) parameterization as presented
in Fig. 16a: (a) GR, GF and GQS are well sorted out; and (b) There are clear time lags between
U10, Et and F and a general trend of increasing F for the same Et value as time advances. These
are explained in further detail below.
a. Wind steadiness
The rates of F change as a function of Et are different in GR, GF and GQS. For this
discussion, we consider the rate   d F / dEt ; conceptually  probably can be regarded as a
measure of the efficiency of wave breaking for SSA production. The magnitude of  is high in the
less energetic breaking condition (Et<0.35 W m-2), to the left side of the dashed line in Fig. 16a.
For Et>0.35 W m-2,  is noticeably lower in rising winds (GR, red symbols) than in falling winds
(GF, blue symbols). Higher SSA flux in falling wind than that in rising winds is also reported by
Ovadnevaite et al. (2012). In closely related whitecap coverage measurements, Sugihara et al.
(2007) and Callaghan et al. (2008) also report higher whitecap fraction as a function of wind speed
in falling winds than that in rising winds.
A plausible explanation of this observation is offered here. It indicates that all breakings are
not created equal. With respect to SSA production, soft and gentle breaking as occurring in low or
falling winds are much more efficient and can produce more SSA flux per unit of energy
dissipation rate. In rising high winds, the more violent breaking events entrain larger air cavities

JPO/31Oct2014

23

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

that escape by buoyancy before they are fully broken down into smaller bubbles for more efficient
SSA production. As a result, it costs more units of energy dissipation rate to produce the same
quantity of SSA flux by the more-violent breaking in strong rising winds compared to the situation
with gentler breakings in low or falling winds. So, efficiency cannot be rushed.
There are also alternative interpretations, of course. For example, we may connect rising and
falling winds with developing and developed seas. In such terms, part of the Et for rising wind still
goes to growing the waves, thus less of the Et goes into entraining air and producing SSA. For the
falling wind, the wave field is developed so all the Et goes into pushing air into water. That is, less
air is entrained during developing seas and more during developed seas. However, the fraction of
momentum or energy needed to sustain wave growth is only a few percent of the wind input. For
example, the analyses of Hasselmann et al. (1973), Donelan (1998) and Hwang and Sletten (2008)
all give a low single-digit percentage in field conditions ( #  U10c p1 typically less than about 2).
In comparison, the energy required to entrain the bubbles against buoyancy represents 30% to 50%
of the total surface wave energy dissipated during breaking (Lamarre and Melville 1991). Hwang
et al. (2012) present analysis results of wave growth in mixed seas and unsteady wind forcing. In
terms of the dimensionless growth functions, the wave energy level for a given fetch or wave age
is higher in both rising and falling phases of unsteady events compare to that in quasi-steady
events. The difference in the wave growth is subtle although detectable. Given the great disparity
of the energy levels required for sustaining wave growth and entraining air, it seems that the
difference of wave development in rising and falling winds is not enough to explain the factor-oftwo difference in the SSA production between falling and rising winds, as shown in Fig. 16a.
Support for the cavity size argument can be found in the research of length and velocity scales
of breaking waves. Source function analysis of short scale waves shows that the length scale of

JPO/31Oct2014

24

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

the signature of dissipation function is shorter in mixed sea than that in wind seas as shown in Fig.
4 of Hwang and Wang (2004). Similarly, the breaking wave velocity scale is found to be smaller
in mixed seas than that in wind seas based on feature tracking or Doppler analysis of sea spikes,
which are closely related to breaking waves (Frasier et al. 1998; Hwang et al. 2008a, b). Because
the buoyancy of the entrained air cavity is proportional to the volume, the smaller breaker length
scale of mixed seas (more likely in falling winds) is more efficient for SSA or whitecap generation.
The rate  in the quasi-steady event 5QS is rather erratic and signifies that in a natural setting,
it is very unlikely to encounter truly steady wind conditions. In the situation of our experiment, the
quasi-steady event is preceded by a couple of strong wind episodes and the wave system is
composed of windsea superimposed on strong swell (Fig. 3a). The separation frequency between
windsea and swell fluctuates wildly, resulting in a large variation of the estimated energy
dissipation rate. The situation is further complicated by the time lags between U10, Et and F,
which is discussed next.
b. Event time lags
The time series illustrated in Fig. 16b clearly show the response lags of Et and F with respect
to the rising and falling of U10. Generally, the separation between peaks of U10 and Et are much
closer than those of U10 and F. For example, in the quasi-steady segment (event 5QS), the peaks
of U10 and Et are within the same hour (0.72 h difference) whereas those of U10 and F are 5.5 h
apart. These response time lags represent one source of data scatter. Two examples are highlighted
here.
(i) Using the quasi-steady event 5QS as an illustration, in Fig. 16a the red rectangle box
contains the data points that Et is near the peak while F is still slowly evolving, and the blue
rectangle box contains the data with F near its peak while Et is near the trough of this event.

JPO/31Oct2014

25

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

(ii) Transitioning from rising event to falling event, the lags contribute to the appearance of
increasing F under decreasing Et, as shown in the magenta box in Fig. 16a containing the data
points in the neighborhood between the Et peak and the F peak crossing from rising event 2R to
falling event 3F. To aid the visualization, the temporal evolution of the data points in these two
events are shown with connected symbols.
c. The issue of temporal accumulation
Summarizing the observations given in (a) and (b) above, the relationship F(Et) as shown in
Fig. 16a describes the evolution of episodic SSA production by breaking waves. In our experiment,
the atmosphere starts out with very few SSA (minimum near time t=~117.3 d and again a local
low at t=~118.1 d in Fig. 16b). When viewed in terms of F(Et), the six identified events of wind
fluctuations show a generally spiraling upward trend of F increasing its magnitude with time for
a given level of energy dissipation rate Et. This result appears to highlight the long time-constant
of SSA: on the order of several hours for 10 m particles and several days for 1 m particles (e.g.,
Hoppel et al. 2002; Lewis and Schwartz 2004). It is tempting to interpret this result as that “over
the period of about 4 days, the SSA still has not reached steady state and the data exhibits
significant temporal variations.” This long-time-constant interpretation is premature, however,
because of the large fluctuations of the RH, especially in events 1F and 2R compared to the later
periods (see Fig. 11e). In such a situation, it is important to make the distinction between the total
atmospheric aerosol loading within a certain “in situ” size band (the F, N, and V presented up
to this point) and the aerosol properties “at the source” of a certain size band. Indeed, the relative
humidity is a key meteorological parameter in aerosol models (e.g., Fitzgerald 1978; Gathman
1983; Gerber 1985).

JPO/31Oct2014

d. Humidity effect
Figure 17 shows four SSA size spectra, each the mean over 2 consecutive hours of the 20-min
average measurements. These four spectra are selected, two each, in rising- and falling-wind
periods with varying RH; the average wind speeds are all within 11.00.1 m s-1. It is clear that at
a lower ambient RH, the measured ris corresponds to a larger source radius r98  2r80 (e.g., Lewis
and Schwartz 2004). Because the SSA number and flux in the coarse mode decreases exponentially
with size (Fig. 17a; also Figs. 7b and 7d), the smaller size particles missed in the lower RH data
contributes significantly to the lower integrated SSA values in the earlier part of the experiment,
as shown in the data during t=118.1~119.23 d (Fig. 13) or event 2R (Fig. 16a).
We can compare the black and magenta curves of the two rising wind events 2R and 4R in
Fig. 17, with average RH=71.4% and 89.3%, respectively. Although the black curve (2R, lower
RH) is generally higher than the magenta curve, because of its reduced coverage of the small size
in the generation source, the integrated SSA number and flux within the same ris range are in fact
much smaller compared to those of the magenta curve (4R, higher RH): [N (m-3), F (m-2 s-1)] =
[1.01106, 1.98104] for 2R and [2.43106, 3.44104] for 4R. Interestingly, the integrated volumes
V (m3 m-3) are much closer: 1.41108 vs. 1.24108. The result suggests that the SSA mass or
volume at the generation source is similar in the two events although they are 1.3 days apart, and
the initial impression of temporal accumulation as might have been deduced from Fig. 16a or 13
is more likely caused by the much lower RH in the earlier event, thus the in situ size range missed
the smaller particles at the generation source.
On the other hand, the two falling wind events (green and blue curves in Fig. 17), occur 1.8
days apart with average RH=81.7% and 84.6%, have similar size coverage of the source SSA
particles, but the SSA properties in terms of number, volume and flux all increase with time for

JPO/31Oct2014

27

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

these two examples. To have a more comprehensive comparison, Fig. 18 presents the complete
data set, showing the flux and volume integrated over the size range r80 = 2 to 10 m to avoid the
mismatch of the SSA size range at the generation source caused by the RH fluctuation. On the top
row they are plotted against Et and on the bottom row they are against U10. Although data scatter
is large, the impression of temporal accumulation derived from Fig. 16a disappears; the most
prominent feature left behind is the contrast between rising winds and falling winds. Indeed, the
parameterization with Et, which considers the wind and wave evolution, is useful for elucidating
the physics of SSA production. The magnitudes of F and V in falling winds are about twice
those in rising winds for the same Et, indicating very different wave breaking efficiency for SSA
production as discussed in Sec. 4.1.a.
As an additional comment on the time evolution issue, using t=118.1 d, when the SSA value
is very small, as the reference starting time, the results illustrated in Fig. 18 indicate that data
collected several hours after the starting time is not very different from that collected days later
(compare events 2R and 4R, or 3F and 6F). This is in contrast to the notion that the time constant
of particles with radii of several m is on the order of days based on the consideration of the
particle settling velocity alone (e.g., Hoppel et al. 2002; Lewis and Schwartz 2004).
To reiterate, in addition to the physical reasons given in Sec. 4.1.a-b, the requirements of the
dry deposition method for estimating the SSA production can potentially be suggested as the cause
of the differences between rising and falling winds. As one of its assumptions, dry deposition
method requires steady state conditions that persisted sufficiently long time to saturate marine
boundary layer with aerosol particles and thus establish a balance between upward and downward
fluxes. However, any change in wind speed and thus effective aerosol production rate disrupts this
balance, leading to underestimates of surface flux in rising winds and overestimates of surface flux

JPO/31Oct2014

28

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

in falling winds. This property can be suggested as the reason for the delay in production flux
observed in Fig 16a. However, if this were the case, the surface flux’s dependence on the
brightness temperature shown in Fig. 13d would demonstrate similar delayed behavior as its
dependence on the dissipation rate (Figs. 13b, 16a), which it does not. Therefore, the ability of the
microwave radiometer to capture the difference in SSA production rate in falling and rising winds
eliminates the shortcomings of the dry deposition method as the primary cause and supports a
physical reasoning for the observed phenomenon, such as the breaking efficiency given in section
4.1.a. This leads to our last discussion item: the ocean surface roughness.
4.2. Remote sensing of ocean surface roughness
Figure 13 shows a much improved correlation in F(Tb) compared to F(U10), F(Et) or
F(P<f>). In Fig. 19, the SSA flux integrated over the size range r80 = 2 to 10 m is presented in
the same format as Fig. 13 and the conclusion is not altered regarding the improved correlation
between F2~10 and the roughness component of brightness temperature Tb compared to the other
three forcing factors that are closely connected to wave breaking. Whereas the Et, and to a different
degree U10 or P<f>, parameterization sorts the SSA data into distinct falling wind and rising wind
groups (Figs. 18, 19), the Tb parameterization blends them together more smoothly. In essence:
“Go short” when searching for single-variable parameterizations.
In the discussion of Fig. 13, we have ventured an explanation that although wave breaking is
an important generation source, the final state of the SSA in the marine boundary layer is controlled
by the turbulent processes that are closely connected to the ocean surface roughness. The time
scale of turbulent mixing is much shorter than the time scale of SSA particle settling velocity, and
provides a favorable condition for the application of dry deposition method to calculate the SSA
flux. Although the exact processes are still to be identified, it is noteworthy that similar results

showing much better correlation with roughness ( MSS) than wind speed have been reported for
the gas transfer velocity (e.g., Bock et al. 1999; Frew et al. 2004, 2007), as has been described in
the Introduction section.
Microwave sensors are especially suited for obtaining the ocean surface roughness properties.
In S14 a parameterization model using the passive microwave radiometer output is presented.
Active microwave sensors such as altimeter, scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) also
yield ocean surface roughness information. Frew et al. (2007) describe an application of dualfrequency (Ku and C band) spaceborne altimeter data for global estimation of air-sea gas transfer
velocity fields. The application can be extended to other airborne or spaceborne scatterometer or
SAR data. Also, ocean surface backscattering from radars installed on land, towers or ships
contains critical information of the ocean surface roughness. In particular, the shipborne X band
navigational radar backscattering onboard field cruises can be useful supplemental data even
though it is not calibrated: post processing comparing the uncalibrated average radar cross section
(RCS) as a function of U10 with the established calibrated NRCS (normalized RCS) curves would
render the supplemental data quite valuable for retrieving the small scale ocean surface roughness.
5. Summary
This paper presents the analysis results of simultaneous measurements of aerosol, wind, wave,
underwater acoustic noise and microwave brightness temperature collected during a 2012
experiment conducted onboard the free-drifting FLIP. Focusing on the wave breaking effects on
the SSA production, the analysis casts parameterizations of total (size integrated) SSA properties
-- namely, number (N), volume (V), and flux (F) -- in terms of the wind speed U10, breaking
wave energy dissipation rate Et combining the wind and wave variables, and acoustic noise P<f>
attributable to bubbles generated by breaking waves. The brightness temperature data is processed

to extract the roughness and foam components, of which the roughness component Tb is found
to be more correlated to the SSA properties. The forcing factors Et, P<f>, and Tb represent ocean
surface processes with length scales of O(10 m), O(1 m), and O(0.01 m), respectively.
Using the U10 parameterization as a reference, the correlation coefficients of the SSA
properties with Et deteriorate. This is unexpected considering that Et incorporates both wind and
wave properties. It represents the available mechanical energy discharged by wave breaking for
entraining air into water and for the subsequent SSA production. Further analysis indicates that
although Et is not a good candidate for single-variable parameterization, it is very useful for
clarifying the efficiency of wave breaking regarding SSA production. In particular, except in lowdissipation breaking conditions, the SSA production in rising wind events is less effective than
that in falling winds. Our interpretation of this result is that in strong rising winds, the breaking is
likely more violent and entrains larger air cavities that do not stay in water long enough to be
effectively broken down to smaller bubbles for more efficient SSA generation. In contrast, the
gentler breaking in low or falling winds is able to make better use of the smaller entrained air
cavities because they stay underwater longer for turbulence splitting. Support of the air cavity size
argument can be found in the analyses of breaking wave length and velocity scales showing smaller
breaker size in mixed seas than in wind seas (Frasier et al. 1998; Hwang et al. 2008a, b), and the
source function analysis of short waves indicating that the length scale of the signature of
dissipation function shifts to shorter scale in mixed seas compared to that in wind seas (Hwang
and Wang 2004).
The correlation analysis of the SSA properties (N, V, and F) further shows a persistent
improvement toward the shortest-scale parameterization. This is interpreted as that whereas wave
breaking represents an important source for SSA generation, the final state of atmospheric aerosol

properties is determined by turbulent transport processes that are better characterized by the ocean
surface roughness. Active and passive microwave sensors are especially suitable for obtaining the
ocean surface roughness properties. They represent a valuable resource to aid our investigation of
the complicated air-sea interaction problems.

Appendix: Supplemental Information
A. Foam and roughness components of brightness temperature
There are two main components of the wind and wave contribution to the deviation of the
brightness temperature from the flat surface value: foam and roughness. The formula connecting
Tb and Ts can be written as (Hwang 2012)
Tbp   e0 p   e fp   erp  Ts ,

(A1)

where subscript p is polarization, e0 is the emissivity of the flat surface without foam,  e f is the
emissivity correction due to foam for the flat surface contribution, and  er is the rough surface
contribution. These three components are given by:
2

 
e0 p  1  Rpp
,
0

(A2)

 0
where Rpp
 ,  is the Fresnel reflection coefficient of polarization p, the value is determined by

the incidence angle  and the frequency-dependent relative permittivity  ;

 e fp  eep  e0 p ,

(A3)

where eep is the effective emissivity of the flat surface with foam (to be further discussed in the
next paragraph); and
 

 erp    W  k ',  ' g p  f , ,  ,  e , k ',  '  k ' d ' dk ' ,

(A4)

0 

where W is the directional ocean surface roughness spectrum with k the surface wave number and

 the propagation direction, and g p is the electromagnetic “weighting” function for the p
polarization; the full expression of g p is given by Yueh et al. (1994a, Appendices 1-3) and
Johnson and Zhang (1999, p. 2308). An effective relative permittivity  e is used by Hwang (2012)

for evaluating (A4), instead of the sea water relative permittivity  sw (without foam adjustment)
in the original papers by Johnson and Zhang (1999) and Yueh et al. (1994a).
The relative permittivity of air and water differ considerably for microwave frequencies,
therefore even a small amount of air can produce non-trivial changes in the relative permittivity of
the resulting mixture. To account for the effect of entrained air, ideally we need to know the
fraction of air in water (void fraction) and the vertical distribution of the bubble clouds carrying
the air into water. Considering the small penetration depth of microwaves, for example, the skin
depth is about 2 mm at 10 GHz (Plant 1990), Hwang (2012) uses the fraction of whitecap coverage
as a proxy of the void fraction in the mixing rule for the evaluation of the effective relative
permittivity  e . The approach renders the emission problem of foam-covered ocean surface to
quasi-2D (horizontal). The whitecap fraction represents an upper bound of the void fraction
because it is equivalent to assuming 100% of air in the depth of microwave influence under the
foamy area, whereas the air entrainment decreases exponentially with water depth (e.g., Wu 1981;
Hwang et al. 1990). The effective relative permittivity  e of the air-water mixture is computed
with the quadratic mixing rule in a similar approach of Anguelova (2008):
1/ 2
 ,
 e   f a a1/ 2  1  f a   sw
2

(A5)

where  sw is relative permittivity of sea water without whitecaps and  a =1 is relative permittivity
of air, and f a is air fraction approximated by the whitecap fraction.
Based on this “equivalent medium” approach, the calculated results are in very good
agreement with a global dataset of WindSat microwave radiometer measurements with wind speed
coverage up to about 42 m s-1 (Meissner and Wentz 2009). The WindSat measurements include
five microwave frequencies (6, 10, 18, 23 and 37 GHz) for both vertical and horizontal

B. Surface wave modulation of underwater acoustic noise
The phase center of our acoustic array is at 18.2 m underwater and the significant wave height
reaches to more than 4 m during the high wind period. It is thus of some concern about the
quantitative value of the underwater acoustic noise normalized by the area of reception, because
the surface area intercepted by the cone of acoustic reception is obviously modulated by the surface
waves passing over the acoustic array. Because there is no pressure sensor in the acoustic array
and the surface wave sensor system and the acoustic array are not collocated, we are not able to
do a point-by-point correction of the surface wave modulation. Only the statistical average is
investigated here.
Let’s define A as the circular surface area of acoustic reception. In the absence of waves, it is
related to the depth of acoustic sensor h by
A   R 2    h tan   ,
2

(A6)

where R is the radius of the circle and  is the angle between the vertical axis of the array and a
point on the reception circle. Installed on the stable FLIP, the instantaneous depth of the array in
the presence of wave motion is h+, thus the instantaneous acoustic reception area is modulated
as
A    h    tan   ,
2

(A7)

The average ratio of the modulated area to the reference area in static condition can be written as
A

The maximum significant wave height during our experiment is 4.45 m, so the maximum

C. Humidity adjustment of SSA size
At the source region near the air-sea interface, the RH for the SSA particles is about 98% with
sea water of 35 psu salinity (Lewis and Schwartz 2004). Ejected into air with lower RH the particle
size decreases through evaporation. As the atmospheric RH fluctuates, the particle size also
fluctuates through absorbing moisture in higher RH or evaporation in lower RH environment. The
thermodynamic processes of deliquesce and effloresces of aerosol particles are complicated and
strongly dependent on the chemical compositions of the aerosols (e.g., Winkler 1973; Fitzgerald
1
1978; Tang et al. 1997; Lewis and Schwartz 2004). For example, the growth ratio ris rdry
 RH  of

maritime aerosol is much larger than that of continental aerosol.
Many useful approximation formulas for sea salt aerosols have been developed to convert the
in situ measured size ris with the ambient RH input to the reference size r80 at RH=80% (e.g.,
Lewis and Schwartz 2004). We have used the Gerber (1985) formulation (in a lookup table) for
getting the dry particle size rdry in our data processing, but in order to make comparison with
published results using r80 , we employ the approximation formulas r80  2rdry and r98  4rdry
(Lewis and Schwartz 2004).

JPO/31Oct2014

FLIPexptR0Noline.docx

Figure A1a plots the ratios rdry  r80  and rdry  r98  for the coarse mode SSA reported here,
showing reasonably good agreement between the lookup table (Gerber 1985) and the
approximation formulas (Lewis and Schwartz 2004).
The lookup table at the early stage of our data processing lists triplets of [ ris , RH, rdry ], it is
difficult to obtain r80 from the table directly; the additional convoluted interpolations may further
introduce errors. Our approach of blending the two different schemes of RH correction for the SSA
radius, i.e., using the Gerber (1985) algorithm in lookup table to obtain rdry from ris , and Lewis
and Schwartz (2004) approximation to obtain r80 from rdry , is not expected to create large errors
with respect to the conclusions discussed in this paper regarding the physical processes impacting
the SSA production. The new lookup table lists quadruplets [ ris , RH, rdry , r80 ]. The ratio rdry r801
based on Gerber (1985) ranges between 0.455 and 0.493 for RH between 70% and 98% (Fig. A1b).
