We study analytically the finite-temperature phase diagram of proton ordering of a quasi-two
dimensional hydrogen-bonded system, namely the squaric acid crystal(H2 C4 O4 ). We take into
account the four-spin interaction model at the zeroth order. Using an improvised loop algorithm
within the Stochastic series expansion quantum monte carlo method, we find two distinct phases as
we increase the temperature and magnetic-field. One of the phase is the Πf , the phase with long
range ferroelectric order and the other being an intermediate state with strong local correlations,
i.e, a quantum liquid-like state Πql . The transition to Πf shows a very small anomalous peak
in the specific heat with strong dependence of critical temperature on the strength of dipole-dipole
interaction. The presence of the small peak is attributed to the absence of macroscopic degeneracy in
the presence of dipole-dipole interaction and re-entrance of such degeneracy to some extent at small
temperature. Though the degenerate ground state manifold is identical for a four-spin interaction
or appropriate two-spin interaction model at zeroth order, we find that for the former case, the
required strength of dipole-dipole interaction is quite larger to induce a ferroelectric phase. The
work also presents an intricate connection of quantum fluctuation and thermal fluctuation in the
presence of competing interaction with entropic effects.

INTRODUCTION

The observation of finite temperature phase transition
in condensed matter system is a common phenomena
since unknown past. We know how various types of phase
transition phenomenon, few like the metallic to superconducting phase transition or solid to liquid to vapor transition or the structural or magnetic transition is brought
in by the changes of temperature. As the temperature
changes, the interactions between constituent particles
are renormalized or tuned so that new phases of matters appear. The interplay of fundamental interactions,
quantum mechanics as well as the thermal fluctuation all
play equally vital role in such event. In this article we
will be discussing the composite effect of finite temperature along with the magnetic field phase diagram of a
well known material known as squaric acid, commonly
represented as H2 (SQ)4 where SQ generally represent a
structural unit(e.g: C4 O4 ). This particular material had
drawn the attention of condensed matter physicists (theory and experiment alike) over more than half a century
1–3,5–8
. The material is very intriguing, as the primary
interaction is governed by the hydrogen bonds and the
associated proton dynamics. The material is a layered
three dimensional one where each 2D layer is made of
square lattice like structure9 with each square containing
a unit of SQ. Each of them are held together by Hydrogen bonds which is mediated by protons. An individual
proton undergoes quantum motions between double well
potential1,2 as found from the isotopic study of the material. The proton motion is conveniently modelled as
quantum spins(spin 1/2).
H2 SQ is very similar to water ice system, where the

local constraint in the form of "ice-rules" dictating the
proton ordering restricts the ground state to have configurations where in each molecule having exactly four
hydrogen-bonds with two protons being near to C4 O4
unit and the other two being at far10,14–16 . Apart from
the proton dynamics and the interactions between them,
the material posses dipole-dipole interactions which is evident from the fact that the material undergoes a paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transition9 . These systems
are of particular interest since the last decade because
not only that these systems exhibit some of the peculiar
properties: showing no signs of phase transition, i.e, they
tend to be disordered down to few milli Kelvins, there is
frustration or competition leading to "residual" or "zeropoint entropy"10 . In some cases, strong fluctuations with
high degree of entanglement between the ice-rule configurations may lead to exotic phases like quantum-spin
liquid17–21 . Long back, this "ice-rule" constraint and the
movement of protons on H2 SQ were mapped into suitable vertex model or quantum pseudo spin model24–26
to understand the antiferroelectric properties. Further,
the thermal motion of a SQ-unit in a squaric acid system is strongly coupled with the protons movements.
This motivated the study of interaction of phonons with
pseudo-spins27–29 . Though these pioneering works had
successfully examined some key features of the system,
many of the theoretical methods were mostly limited to
the mean-field level without totally considering the effect of geometrical frustration more rigorously. For example, quantum fluctuation along with the entropic effects, which is presumably important for understanding
the quantum para-electricity under pressure has not been
seriously considered so far.

are also known for their ferroelectric polarizability due
to certain proton ordering(e.g: KH2 PO4 , H2 SQ). There
has been ample studies regarding the electronic polarization emerging from certain ordering of proton configurations in the system with emphasis on both the fundamental physics and the application to electronic devices22,23 .
Apart from these, One of the interesting feature of H2 SQ
is that, in general, the external pressure increases the
tunneling rate of protons between the two potential minima, which reduces local polarizations, and consequently,
suppresses the ferroelectricity. Indeed, in H2SQ, Tc is
suppressed with increasing pressure. A peculiar intermediate state, however, appears before the polarization is
lost in each molecule: the macroscopic polarization vanishes while the polarization in each molecule is retained11 .
Consequently, a quantum paraelectric state is realized in
the low-temperature limit. Thus the material presents an
unique test bed where the effect of external pressure as
well as temperature could be investigated on the proton
dynamics so that a number of interesting and competing
aspect can be observed in a single study. Here we consider the model Hamiltonian(2.1) given below. There are
three competing interactions at the effective order. The
model Hamiltonian at zeroth order consists of a fourspin plaquette interaction with a strength J0 . When the
Hamiltonian is studied in the presence of a magnetic field
characterized by the parameter K, the system shows a
confinement-deconfinement phase transition. The model
also includes a next-nearest-neighbor Ising-like interaction with a strength J1 and a dipole-dipole interaction
J2 <J1 . Usually, the presence of J2 causes the ferroelectricity of these materials. The model was shown to ex-

hibit both confinement-deconfinement transition (CDT)
and ferroelectric quantum phase transition (FT) for an
appropriate set of parameters of the model Hamiltonian.
However, in the present paper we study the finite temperature (incorporated with magnetic-field) properties of
each of these phases. In the presence of intra-molecular
coupling term J1 , we identify a smooth crossover to paraelectric phase from a globally disordered dipole phase. In
the presence of J2 , the system gets ferroelectrically ordered at low temperatures and with the increase of field
strength K, the ferroelectric ordered is being destroyed
to a paraelectric phase which also undergoes a finite temperature second order phase transition to a conventional
paraelectric phase. We then numerically chart out the
phase diagram in the T − K plane. In particular to this
model Hamiltonian unlike the earlier studies, which were
limited at the mean-field level, the effect of geometrical
frustration has not been fully clarified yet. We use a unbiased stochastic series expansion(SSE) quantum monte
carlo(QMC) technique to take into account the quantum fluctuation under the entropic effects(arising from
the ice-rules), which is presumably important for understanding the quantum paraelectricity under pressure.
Our study is also important in a way that for such an
interacting four-spin Hamiltonian, we have been able to
obtain the phase diagram successfully with appropriate
quantum monte carlo scheme.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec.II,
we introduce the effective model Hamiltonian and methods. After introducing the pseudo-spin model in Sec.III,
we briefly discuss the implementation scheme of SSE
QMC method used for our Hamiltonian in the subsection of method part. We then explain the order parameter that has been calculated in our analysis. The results obtained from our SSE QMC simulation has been
presented in details in Sec.IV. In Sec.V, we discuss our
results in a broader perspective including a qualitative
comparison with the relevant earlier experimental and
theoretical study. We summarize our results in Sec.VI.

The parameter space of the Hamiltonian H is three
dimensional with J0 being the largest followed by K, J1 ,
and J2 in magnitude. J0 (>0) gives rise to Z2 gauge invariance and the intra-molecular coupling term J1 gives
rise to the restricted ice rules implying that only those
states with ice rules having finite dipole moment are allowed. The presence of four-spin interactions signified by
the coupling J0 stems from the fact that for a real H2 SQ
molecule, the energy of a given molecule does depend on
the relative position of the four hydrogen ions it shares
with neighboring molecules3 . This is particularly important because though at zeroth order the hydrogen ions are
assumed to be tunneling in a quantum double well potential and thus an Ising-like two-spin interaction could
also be a possible candidate for dynamics at zeroth order.
However, as the height of the potential well is not significantly large, a more general four-spin interaction is more
suitable1 . The second term of the Hamiltonian appears
naturally from an approximated, possible two-spin interaction for a plaquette. Remember that for a plaquette
there can be four nearest-neighbor Ising-like interactions
and two Ising-like interactions across the diagonal links.
The energy scale of these two types are different and the
previous four types of Ising exchange interactions are an
approximate representation of the general four-spin interaction represented by J0 . Since there are ground states
with each square plaquette having finite dipole moments,
a more general Hamiltonian would also have these dipoledipole interaction term J2 . The presence of dipole-dipole
interactions is also inevitable from the fact that without
their presence the observed ferroelectric transition would
not be possible as argued in Ref.1 . The physical origin of
dipole-dipole interactions arises naturally when the local

Stochastic series expansion quantum monte
carlo method

With the ever shifting focus on quantum monte carlo
methods(QMC) for an unbiased calculations the hunt for
an efficient cluster algorithms is on as far as stochastic series expansion(SSE) QMC method is concerned.
The last few decades has very limited success in developing efficient algorithms at finite temperature especially for systems with frustration or for systems with
macroscopic degeneracy. Earlier methods relied on constructing the clusters based on a "link-decomposition" of
Hamiltonian found to be inefficient, despite being tried
in various forms by constructing the clusters along τ dimension(imaginary-time). Nevertheless, here we use
a variant of an recently developed microcanonical cluster algorithm(quantum cluster update) where it uses the
plaquette decomposition of the Hamiltonian within the
framework of Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) pioneered by Sandvik31,39 . Clusters are constructed based
on a plaquette percolation process with the notion of
"premarked motifs" which act as a flag in determining
the way in which it connects the legs of all diagonal plaquette operators “living on” various planes of imaginarytime direction. Once all clusters are constructed, each
can be independently flipped with probability 1/2 within
a Swendsen-Wang type implementation. Here in the
present study, we have employed and improvised an algorithm within the stochastic series expansion monte-carlo
method38 . Readers interested in the details regarding the
efficiency and performance of the algorithm compared
to percolation based algorithm can find here38 for an
"odd" Ising gauge Hamiltonian with anti-ferromagnetic
Ising exchange term. The major difference in the design
of the algorithm is that the choice of premarked motifs
differ for each systems with complicated interactions or
frustration, where an intuition or little prior knowledge
of the equilibrium ensemble is a bonus for improving the
algorithm further, this is also where we had implemented
our idea to investigate the Hamiltonian we considered.
Since there are three distinct regions corresponding to
three different parameters J0 , J1 , J2 with distinct equilibrium ensemble we thus identify different premarked
motifs choice as shown in Fig.(II A). For J2 = 0, we
use the second choice of the premarked motifs(shown in
third column of the Fig.(II A)), as this choice naturally
leads to the equilibrium ensemble of ground state manifold where to minimize the Ising exchange interactions
exactly two frustrated bonds(only those with one parallel to other) are required to be on each plaquette which
corresponds to eigenvalue 4J0 + 4J1 , while configurations

4
with four or zero frustrated bonds have eigen-value 0 and
hence corresponding plaquette operators do not appear
in the operator string. Our choice of motif in the J2 = 0
case consists of two privileged diagonal sites among the
four that make up a spatial plaquette. Thus each spatial
plaquette has two distinct possible motifs. The motif on
a given spatial plaquette determines the cluster decomposition of plaquette operators at that location in the
following way: If only one frustrated bond touches the
two privileged sites, the four legs corresponding to these
two sites are assigned to a a priori different cluster, and
the other four legs make up the other cluster. If the privileged site is touched by two or zero frustrated bonds, then
the four legs corresponding to the privileged site and its
diagonally opposite site are assigned to one cluster, and
the other four legs to an a priori different cluster (which
could in principle merge with the other cluster at a future
step in the cluster construction).
We also study the parameter regime with J1,2 = 0.
Here the premarked motifs schemes pretty much remain
same except that the number of choices to use motifs are
six in the present case and hence can be invoked randomly on the fly. The premarked motif used in this case
is shown in Fig.(II A). We see that on contrary to the
case where J1 6= 0 there is no apparent spin-freezing in
this case thus making the algorithm much more efficient
in this regime. However, despite improvising the sophisticated algorithm to work in the case J1 6= 0 we see some
apparent spin freezing at low temperatures and hence to
avoid that we also invoke the replica exchange method
with temperatures ranging from 0.05 to 1.0. We use system sizes varying from L = 24 to 32(N = 2L2 ) with a
standard 1 × 107 iterations for equilibrations and 1 × 107
for measurements. Results are divided into six bins to estimate statistical errors by the variance among the bins.

In view of the wide scope of our model which might
host different phases dependent on the relative magnitude of the model parameter and temperature as well,
we introduce the relevant parameters in detail. This will
help us to identify each phases as well as to distinguish
from each other without ambiguity. At very high temperature T >> Ji , one generally expects a paraelectric
phases where the dipole-moments associated with each
plaquettes are disordered. The paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transition (due to dipole-dipole interaction
term J2 ) as we lower the temperature is characterized
by the order parameter P which is nothing but the electronic polarization and the associated susceptibility χP .

Apart from the presence of paraelectric and ferroelectric phases, at very low temperature and for small values of J2 , the strength of dipole-dipole interaction, the
ground state is dominated by states determined by J0
and J1 . In this situation, the ground state manifold is
dictated by the states which satisfy the "Ice rule". In true
sense this is a quantum liquid states. To distinguish this
state from the usual paraelectric states, one need to define a order parameter which can successfully establishes
the presence of this state and differentiate it from usual
paraelectric phase and ferroelectric phase. To this end,
following Ref.44 , we define the parameter ρ which detects
the Ice-rule state, i.e, the partially disordered locallycorrelated liquid-like paraelectric phase,

Temperature dependence of P and ρ

RESULTS

We know from the earlier studies12,13 that presence of
dipole-dipole interaction (the J2 term in the Hamiltonian
in Eq.(2.1) induces a ferroelectric order. In the absence
of J2 , the ground state is highly degenerate. The degeneracy for J1 = 0 is exponential though with J1 it is
proportional to the peripheral size of the system. On
the other hand the global ferroelectric order is four fold
degenerate. Thus we see that the effect of temperature
on the system might be very intricate due to the energy
cost for low energy excitations due to competing interactions as well as due to degeneracy of the ground state
manifold for each parameters. This actually necessitates
to examine the order parameter P and ρ both. Interestingly we find that they does not follow each other as we
increase the temperature. Corresponding the susceptibility also shows contrasting behaviour. We first discuss
the temperature dependence of P and ρ followed by the
corresponding susceptibility.

The general behaviour as evident from the QMC simulation suggests that as we turn on the temperature the
ferroelectric order parameter denoted by P sharply decreases for a very small value of temperature. However
this decrease seems to be a two steps process. We call
the first phase of decrease of P as the quantum liquid
states and the higher temperature counterpart which is
the usual para electric phase. The P shows a shoulder like hump at the transition from quantum liquid
like states to para electric states. In Fig. (3)(a-b),
we have shown the variation of P in blue points for
J0 = 1.0, J1 = 0.5, J2 = 0.020, 0.024. The presence of
quantum liquid like states is apparent from the temperature variation of ρ as presented in blue points in
Fig. (3)(c-d). We clearly observe that ρ is almost constant throughout this quantum liquid like state and decreases monotonically when the system yields to paraelectric states. Thus the order parameter P and ρ suggest that as we increase the temperature from zero, the

6
system starts from ferroelectric phase, moves to an intermediate quantum-liquid like state and finally reaches to
a pare-electric phase. In the upper panel of Fig. 4 we
have shown by orange and green points more plots for
the behaviour of P and ρ respectively for various values
of θ in T − Kplane. It shows that for large values of θ,
P and ρ decreases more rapidly than the small values of
θ. This indicates that the pressure and temperature has
opposite effect in the system. The pressure denoted by K
tends to stabilize the ferromagnetic and the intermediate
quantum liquid like states.

B.

Susceptibility χP andχρ and specific heat C/T

The susceptibility obtained due to P , is shown in Fig.
(3)(a-b) by red points which shows a jump at the transition from ferroelectric phase to quantum liquid-like
states. This suggests that ferroelectricity is almost destroyed at this transition. However the susceptibility corresponding to ρ, i.e χρ shows a very interesting feature.
Initially it is almost zero, increases very slowly until the
temperature reaches near to the transition from quantum liquid like states to the paraelectric states. At this
transition the χρ jumps at a higher value and remain
almost constant up to a certain temperature which we
call Tρ and after this, χρ decreases monotonically. The
specific heat at very large temperature shows monotonic
decreasing behaviour characteristic to usual para-electric
phase but at low temperature it shows two peaks of different magnitude as denoted in Fig. (3)(e,f). The largest
peak appears at the transition of quantum liquid like
∗
state and we denote this temperature by TC/T
. However, the sharp nature of the peak indicates a possible
order-disorder phenomenon where the degeneracy seems
to be uplifted to some extent. Below this temperature
specific heat shows another small peak at where the P
starts to decrease from initial constant value for small
T . The peak height of this smaller one tends to decrease
with increase of system size as denoted in the inset of Fig.
(3). In the lower panel Fig. 4 we have shown by orange
and green plots for the behaviour of χP and χρ respectively for various values of θ in T − Kplane. It shows
that for large values of θ, P and ρ has a more sharper
peaks and also they decrease more rapidly compared to
the small values of θ. It suggests that the stability of the
intermediate liquid like state is enhanced by increasing
the K/T ratio. This may be attributed to the fact that
increase of K results into enhancing the bandwidth of
the system resulting into decreasing the thermal effect.

C.

Binder cumulant and critical temperature

In the foregoing discussion we have already introduced
the two critical temperature. The largest one is the Tχ∗ρ
which is signified by the step like jump from almost zero
values of χρ to a higher value. Below this temperature

we observed another critical temperature signified by the
largest jump in the specific heat at the transition to paraelectric phase for the quantum liquid-like state. This
∗
temperature is denoted by TC/T
. Our analysis for the
Binder cumulant as shown in the Fig. (3) shows that the
actual phase transition is very near to the T ∗C/T and we
denote this temperature as TC . As for as our numerical
results and analysis are concerned, Tc = 0.56(47) and
0.56(03) for J2 = 0.020 and 0.030 respectively. The cor∗
responding TC/T
is obtained as 0.060(03) and 0.61(40)
respectively.

D.

Phase diagram

The numerical results presented above suggests the
presence of three phases as we increase the temperature.
The first one is ferroelectric phase which survives for very
small temperature and extends up to Tc obtained from
Binder cumulant. We call this phase as Πf . The jump in
the specific heat signified by TC/T is little higher than the
Tc . Above the Tc there is a presence of a complex quantum liquid like state which extends up to some critical
temperature Tχ?ρ . This phase is very intriguing as long
as the behaviour of order parameter is concerned and we
call this phase as Πql . After Tχ?ρ , the normal para electric
phase develops with no residual quantum correlation between the dipole moments. The above three critical temperature defined above varies as the temperature and the
K is varied. It is instructive to present above three phases
in the contour plot in T − K plane and is presented in
Fig.(5). The results are shown for different J2 strengths
in the T − K plane. For the case where J2 = 0 the system shows a crossover transition from quasi macroscopic
degenerate liquid-like state to a completely disordered
state, with the crossover temperatures shifting to higher
temperatures with J1 as expected. However even for J2
very small, the system orders ferroelectrically(the region
below Tc , orange circles), the region between the Tc and
Tχ?ρ belongs to the liquid-like state.
In contrast to the previous model, the scaling behaviour of the critical boundary shows interesting characteristics, the boundary doesn’t extend into the liquid-like
region rapidly but rather slowly indicating that the dependence of Tc with J2 is complex with lower dynamic
exponent than the previous models44 . Another aspect
is that the ratio of thermal energy(Tc ) to that of J2 is
just 10 which is an order less compared to other model
in hand44 . We believe that the colossal enhancement of
Tc with J2 is related to the lifting of quasi macroscopic
degeneracy. The above finding could be confirmed by
experiment in conjunction with a first-principles study
yielding an estimation of model Hamiltonian realistic parameter range. It is interesting to note that all the phase
transitions that we observe is not of first order but rather
like second order specially the transition from Πf to Πql .
On the other hand the transition from Πql to Πp is a
smooth crossover. The phase Πql and Πf suggests quite

7
a interesting behaviour of ρ and C/T . Let us begin with
Πf first. At T = 0, the system is in ferroelectric state
with global ground state degeneracy of four. As we increase the temperature, the ferroelectric order parameter
P decreases rapidly but ρ remains constant and in addition we observe small peak in C/T . This suggests that
the global ferroelectric order reduces into domain of ferroelectric clusters and also includes the presence of other
states not contributing to P but consistent with Ice rules.
The possibility of presence of these additional states explains the small peaks in C/T which also decreases as
we increase the system size. As far as as the phase Πql
is concerned, we observe the steady decrease of the Ice
rule order parameter ρ which suggests that the excitations now includes the non-Ice rule states as expected.
However the quantum correlation is not lost completely
until the critical temperature Tχρ is reached.

DISCUSSION

We have considered a model where at zeroth order
there is a four-spin Ising gauge like interaction of protons in the pseudo-spin formalism. Earlier results on the
model showed that the system hosts a deconfined phase
for J2 = 012 at zero temperature. We use the model
here to extend the phase diagram along the finite temperature axis. Our results show an Ice-rule dominated
strong proton-proton correlations to be the main physics
of the system. Motivated by experiments and the previous studies, the phase diagram in the T − K plane suggests that the qualitative shape of the critical boundary
Tc is more closer to a linear behaviour for small field
strength consistent with the experimental results53–55 ,
though at large pressure, Tc and T ? does not behave linearly in contrast to experimental results where one finds a
complete linear behaviour for all ranges of applied pressure. Another aspect that we find in our study is the
difference between Tc and T ? which remains constant
through out all pressure ranges, which to our opinion a
remarkable success of our study. However, our results indicate a possible second order phase transition in contrast
to experiments. This deviation with experiments might
be reconciled by considering the inter layer coupling or
more complicated couplings to lattice distortions, which
are neglected in our model. The temperature dependence
of the interaction parameter can not be ruled out as well.
The anomalous specific heat peak at low temperature in
the ferroelectric phase is due to the formation of cluster
of ferroelectric domains. The height of the peak reduces
with the increase of system size suggesting that for small
system, the domain size is comparable to the system itself.
We note that a previous study44 has investigate the finite temperature phase diagram in a related model where
only two-spin interactions has been considered. It is very
important to compare the results and the conformity and
contrast between the two study is of quite academic in-

8
terest. We have found all the phases and the characteristic obtained in their study for example, the phase
transition from the ferroelectric phase to quantum liquid
like states. However our results has improved many aspects and seems more realistic as far as the experimental
results are concerned. For example, the nature of phase
transition as denoted by the specific heat is more steeper.
Similar characteristics is found in the behaviour of ρ as
well. This suggests that our results actually mimic the
phase transition look like second order. Another important aspect is the nature of phase diagram in T −K plane
is linear for small and intermediate values of K and for
large values of K it becomes elliptical which was the case
for all values of K earlier44 . We think the distinct feature
of our results shows that a four-spin interaction at the
zeroth order is more realistic. Also in the present model
the dependence of degeneracy of ground state manifold
is different from the two-spin Hamiltonian. For example, at the zeroth order, four spin interaction includes
non-Ice rule states as well (all spin up and all spin down
in a given plaquette) ice-rule states. The diagonal interaction reduces the macroscopic ground state degeneracy to be proportional to linearly the system dimension.
However for the two body case, the degeneracy is still
macroscopic. We believe that this might be the reason
that the present study is more closure to the experimental realization. Another distinct feature is that, the ratio
of thermal energy to the exchange energy of the dipoledipole interaction Tc /J2 is approximately 1/4 times the
ratio obtained by earlier studies44 , this peculiar aspect is
ascribed to the fact that the ground state for J2 = 0 is
a strong deconfined phase robust to local perturbations
induced in the form of dipole-dipole interaction and it
may be the case where the underlying dynamics of the
quasi-particle excitations in the deconfined phase could
be independent of the dynamics of the excitations with
that of the ferroelectric ground state.

mal fluctuation and the effect of intricate ground state
degeneracy of such system. The model Hamiltonian we
considered involves a four-spin interaction which renders
the present study an interesting one in view of the successfully solving the model as well as to qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings.
In our endeavour to study such a Hamiltonian (2.1)
involving four-spin interaction, we used SSE quantum
monte carlo involving an improvised version of loop update algorithm which efficiently overcome the problem of
ergodic sampling in some parameter regimes. Our theoretical study successfully detected the quantum liquidlike intermediate state before the appearance of conventional paraelectric state as we increase the temperature.
The ferroelectric state which exist before the liquid like
quantum liquid-like state, is characterized by its colossal
dependence of Tc with respect to J2 , the dipole-dipole
interaction. In the intermediate liquid-like state, the local correlations governing the ice-rule constraints are still
valid to a large extent. While the experimental phase
diagram in T − K plane, the phase transition shows a
linear behaviour for all K, we find the linear behaviour
for small and intermediate values of K. Thus though our
results fall short of full experimental confirmation, still
it is a quite an improvement in regard to the earlier theoretical study so far. Also the phase transition from the
ferroelectric phase to quantum liquid like state is more
sharper which reasserts that the model which considered
here is more practical as far as the squaric acid system
is concerned. For further improvement of our results, a
first-principle calculations would be helpful to establish
the correct Hamiltonian as well as fixing the realistic parameters. In addition to this, the inter layer coupling
should be considered to fill the gap between the theoretical and experimental studies. This effort is beyond the
scope of present study and kept as a future scope.
