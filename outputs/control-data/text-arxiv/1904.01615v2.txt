ABSTRACT

Ultraviolet (UV) observations of local star-forming galaxies have begun to establish
an empirical baseline for interpreting the rest-UV spectra of reionization-era galaxies.
However, existing high-ionization emission line measurements at z > 6 (WCIV,0 & 20 Å)
are uniformly stronger than observed locally (WCIV,0 . 2 Å), likely due to the relatively
high metallicities (Z/Z > 0.1) typically probed by UV surveys of nearby galaxies. We
present new HST /COS spectra of six nearby (z < 0.01) extremely metal-poor galaxies
(XMPs, Z/Z . 0.1) targeted to address this limitation and provide constraints on the
highly-uncertain ionizing spectra powered by low-metallicity massive stars. Our data
reveal a range of spectral features, including one of the most prominent nebular C iv
doublets yet observed in local star-forming systems and strong He ii emission. Using all
published UV observations of local XMPs to-date, we find that nebular C iv emission
is ubiquitous in very high specific star formation rate systems at low metallicity, but
still find equivalent widths smaller than those measured in individual lensed systems at
z > 6. Our moderate-resolution HST /COS data allow us to conduct an analysis of the
stellar winds in a local nebular C iv emitter, which suggests that some of the tension
with z > 6 data may be due to existing local samples not yet probing sufficiently high
α/Fe abundance ratios. Our results indicate that C iv emission can play a crucial role
in the JWST and ELT era by acting as an accessible signpost of very low metallicity
(Z/Z < 0.1) massive stars in assembling reionization-era systems.

INTRODUCTION

The first spectroscopic detections of emission lines other
than Lyα in reionization-era galaxies have proved to be
surprisingly challenging to interpret. Prominent emission in
C iii], C iv, He ii, and N v detected at z > 6 belies the presence of very hard ionizing radiation fields at these early
times, and is essentially without precedence in lower-redshift
star-forming galaxy samples (e.g. Stark et al. 2015a,b; Sobral
et al. 2015; Stark et al. 2017; Mainali et al. 2017; Laporte
et al. 2017; Mainali et al. 2018; Dors et al. 2018; Shibuya
et al. 2018; Sobral et al. 2019). Preliminary modeling of this
emission suggests that the observed C iii], C iv, and He ii
may be the signature of very low-metallicity massive stars.
However, this interpretation is presently extremely uncertain due to limitations in our understanding of the ionizing
spectra of metal-poor massive stars (e.g. Crowther & Hadfield 2006; Levesque et al. 2012; Götberg et al. 2018; Stanway
& Eldridge 2019).
The stellar population synthesis models used to interpret high-redshift galaxy observations are anchored by observations in the local Universe. Spectra of individual massive stars have been used to calibrate the effective temperatures and stellar winds of the massive O and B stars which
dominate the ionizing continuum in young galaxies (e.g. Kudritzki et al. 1987; Massey et al. 2005; Crowther & Hadfield
2006; Tramper et al. 2011; Garcia et al. 2014; Crowther et al.
2016). Unfortunately, this is only possible with current facilities inside the Local Group where individual stars can
be reliably resolved, which limits this work to metallicities
above Z/Z ' 0.1 (e.g. Vink et al. 2001; Bouret et al. 2015;
Camacho et al. 2016). As a result, effective temperature and
wind scaling relations have not been directly calibrated for
massive stars at lower metallicities, and predictions of the
ionizing spectra these stars power are essentially entirely
theoretical (e.g. Lejeune et al. 1997; Gräfener et al. 2002;
Smith et al. 2002; Lanz & Hubeny 2003).
Nearby but unresolved star-forming galaxies outside the
Local Group provide laboratories in which to study populations of massive stars at ages and metallicities relevant to
reionization-era galaxy models. Most studies with early UV
spectroscopic instruments focused on relatively bright, massive, relatively high-metallicity star-forming systems (typical
metallicity 12 + log O/H ' 8.2: Leitherer et al. 2011); but the
harder stellar ionizing spectra and higher gas temperatures
expected in low metallicity H ii regions are likely conducive
to stronger high-ionization nebular emission. The Cosmic
Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST /COS) has revolutionized this work, providing the sensitivity and resolution necessary to investigate the ultraviolet high-ionization nebular and wind features powered by
the youngest stars in relatively faint low-metallicity galaxies.
In HST Cycle 23, we obtained moderate-resolution G160M
and G185M COS spectra of 10 star-forming regions characterized by very large specific star formation rates (sSFRs ∼ 102 Gyr−1 ) and nebular or stellar He ii emission in
the optical, targeting C iv λλ1548, 1550, He ii λ1640, O iii]
λλ1661, 1666, and C iii] λλ1907, 1909 (Senchyna et al. 2017,
hereafter S17). The targets in this initial study spanned
metallicities 7.8 ≤ 12 + log O/H ≤ 8.5 (i.e. 0.1 . Z/Z . 0.6),
and reveal a significant variation in nebular emission over
this range. Nebular C iv emission and the highest equivalent

width C iii] both appear in the most metal-poor galaxies
in the sample at 12 + log O/H < 8.0, suggestive of a rapid
hardening of the ionizing spectrum below Z/Z < 0.2 (see
also Chevallard et al. 2018). While this study confirmed that
stars can power nebular C iv emission, the equivalent width
of this doublet in the S17 sample still falls an order of magnitude short of the & 20 Å emission observed in the reionization era. Due to the limited observed sample size, the empirical question of whether the massive stars encountered in
extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs) at 12 + log O/H < 7.7
(Z/Z < 0.1) are capable of powering nebular emission similar to that observed at z > 6 remains unanswered.
To address this paucity of data, in HST Cycle 24 we
obtained HST /COS observations of six star-forming XMPs
with the moderate-resolution grisms G160M and G185M
necessary to disentangle nebular emission from stellar and
interstellar absorption in C iv (GO: 14679, PI: Stark). In
addition, we gather all archival ultraviolet observations of
XMPs which cover C iii] and C iv. In this paper, we provide
the first systematic analysis of these nebular lines and massive stellar wind features in all local XMPs with ultraviolet
constraints, directly assessing the range of nebular emission
powered by Z/Z < 0.1 stellar populations. We outline the
data and measurements in Section 2, present our new results in Section 3, discuss implications for stellar population
modeling in Section 4, and conclude in Section 5.
For comparison with solar metallicity, we assume a solar gas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log10 ([O/H] ) = 8.69
(Asplund et al. 2009) unless otherwise noted. For distance
calculations and related quantities, we adopt a flat cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 . All equivalent widths are
measured in the rest-frame and we choose to associate emission with positive values (W0 > 0).

DATA AND ANALYSIS
Archival Context

Unfortunately, XMPs have rarely been included in ultraviolet spectroscopic campaigns up to this point. Here we assess
the status of the literature on XMPs in the UV to provide
context for our sample and for inclusion in our analysis later
in this paper. Measurements are presented in the appendix
in Table A1. The legacy spectroscopic atlas assembled in Leitherer et al. (2011) summarized the state of ultraviolet spectra prior to the installation of HST /COS, consisting of essentially all useful spectra of star-forming galaxies obtained
with the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) and Goddard
High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS). The earlier International Ultraviolet Explorer telescope (IUE) only allowed
R  1000 spectra and achieved relatively low S/N, making
study of C iii] challenging and C iv essentially impossible
(e.g. Dufour et al. 1988). The Leitherer et al. (2011) sample
contained spectra of regions in four XMPs: SBS 0335-052,
I Zw 18, SBS 1415+437, and Tol 1214-277. However, while
C iii] constraints are available for these systems, the wavelength settings of these observations miss C iv λλ1548, 1550
in all four cases.
Despite its improved sensitivity and spectral resolution, HST /COS has not yet been used extensively to study
XMPs. Among published HST /COS observations with coverage in the 1400–1700 Å range, we find a small number

of local star-forming galaxies with gas-phase metallicities
12 + log O/H < 7.7. Subregions of the canonical very nearby
XMPs I Zw 18, SBS 0335-052, and DDO 68 have been targeted at moderate-resolution with HST /COS, but analysis
of the nebular emission in these systems will be presented
in Wofford et al. (in-preparation). A total of 15 galaxies
with gas-phase oxygen abundances in the XMP regime were
observed at lower resolution with G140L (R ∼ 2000) and
presented by Berg et al. (2016, 2019), including coverage of
C iv. We measure flux in or upper limits on the combined
C iv emission in these spectra in the same way as for nebular
lines in our spectra (see Section 2.4). Measurements of C iv
emission in these observations with the COS/G140L grating
may be underestimated due to blending of interstellar absorption with nebular emission at this lower spectral resolution, but since we cannot directly remove this we proceed
with the line measurements as-is (this absorption is likely
small; see Figure 3). To summarize, we are able to place
constraints on C iv emission in fifteen XMPs with G140L
spectra from the literature, including detections at equivalent widths ranging from 1–11 Å (Table A1).
2.2

XMP Sample Selection for HST /COS

Motivated by the lack of moderate-resolution UV spectra
available at these lowest metallicities, we selected six new
XMPs for study with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph in
HST Cycle 24. Our target selection was guided by several considerations. First, we focused on redshifts z < 0.03,
where the C iii] λλ1907, 1909 doublet is still accessible to
the G185M grism. Second, we aimed to span at least 0.3
dex below 12 + log O/H < 7.7 to investigate metallicity dependence in this regime. Finally, we required the targets to
have a compact star-forming region bright enough in the
UV to be studied in a single orbit per grism. In particular, we selected systems with GALEX NUV magnitudes
i . 18, which yield ETC-predicted signal-to-noise ratios > 3
per resolution element in the G185M continuum at 1900 Å
in one orbit (assuming a flat continuum in Fν ). We selected
6 XMPs without existing ultraviolet spectra satisfying these
requirements from the archival sample of XMPs assembled
in Morales-Luis et al. (2011). The GALEX NUV magnitudes
(ranging from 16.3 to 17.9) of the 6 selected targets span the
brightest quartile of the Morales-Luis et al. (2011) archival
catalog. Their basic properties are summarized in Table 1.
Distance estimates are necessary to compute total stellar masses and star formation rates. Because these systems
reside at redshifts cz . 1500km/s, peculiar velocities can
significantly affect their apparent position in a smooth Hubble flow. We uniformly compute luminosity distances using the local velocity flow model presented by Tonry et al.
(2000), which provides coarse-grained corrections for the peculiar velocities of galaxies in nearby clusters. We assume
H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 (Hinshaw et al. 2013) and redshifts
measured from strong nebular lines in the optical spectra
(see Section 2.4). This procedure yields distances ranging
from 8–29 Mpc for the newly-targeted XMPs (Table 1). At
these distances, the 2.5 00 COS aperture corresponds to physical scales of 100–400 pc. We will discuss the broadband
imaging in the following subsection 2.3, and proceed to describe the optical and UV spectra in Sections 2.4 and 2.5,
respectively.

Imaging

Broadband optical imaging provides important information
about the stellar populations underlying the ultraviolet spectra. We plot optical mosaic images of our targets in Figure 1.
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ugriz imaging covers five
of the six galaxies studied in this paper, while J0405-3648
was imaged by DECam in grizY as part of the first data release of the Dark Energy Survey (DES: Abbott et al. 2018).
Since this paper is concerned primarily with optical and ultraviolet spectra probing regions on the scale of . 3 00 , we
fit SDSS aperture photometry measured within a 1.5 00 radius centered on the HST /COS targets. This photometric
aperture is standard for SDSS fiber analysis, and matches
the size of the 1.25 00 radius HST /COS aperture after convolving with the typical SDSS seeing (1.35 00 FWHM in the
r-band).
We use the SED fitting software beagle1 (Chevallard &
Charlot 2016) to derive constraints on the recent star formation in these objects. In particular, we adopt the full Gutkin
et al. (2016) model grid which combines the latest version
of the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) stellar population synthesis results with the photoionization code cloudy (Ferland
et al. 2013) to self-consistently fit the combination of stellar
continuum and nebular emission underlying the broadband
photometry. We fit the circular 3 00 aperture SDSS/DES photometry in all available optical bands alongside the equivalent width of Hβ emission measured from the optical spectra
(Section 2.4) to explicitly constrain nebular band contamination. We assume a constant star formation history2 and
allow the star formation rate, stellar mass, metallicity (gasphase and stellar, which we assume are identical here), gas
ionization parameter log U, and effective attenuation τ̂V to
vary. For this photometric fitting, we adopt the 2-component
attenuation model presented by Charlot & Fall (2000). The
redshift and distance is fixed as measured in Table 1. In addition to the aperture magnitudes fit here, we also measure total flux of each galaxy in the i-band from a segmented image
(produced using photutils: Bradley et al. 2018) and present
these measurements in Table 1. This total flux ranges from
3–24 times that measured in the circular aperture, so assuming a constant mass-to-light ratio the total stellar masses
may be larger by up to 1.4 dex.
The resulting constraints on the stellar mass, star formation rate, and attenuation are displayed in Table 2. These
fits indicate that the stellar populations within 3 00 are low
in stellar mass (4.9 < log10 (M/M ) < 6.4) and attenuation
(τ̂V ≤ 0.12), and forming stars at a range of rates: with the
specific star formation rate sSFR = SFR/M ranging from
2.1–18 Gyr−1 . These masses are comparable to those of the
higher-metallicity galaxies presented in S17, but the sSFR
values are lower than the 100 Gyr−1 which characterize those
particularly extreme star-forming regions. Correspondingly,
we infer significantly older ages as well (in this constant

Version 0.19.9; http://www.jacopochevallard.org/beagle/
As discussed in (Senchyna & Stark 2019), the assumption of
a constant star formation history minimizes the number of free
parameters being fit and allows for consistent comparison with
SED fitting conducted at z > 6, but will yield systematically lower
stellar mass estimates than fits assuming a declining or multiplecomponent star-formation history.

sSFR), ranging from 57–471 Myr compared to the median
10 Myr derived in S17. This implies that we are viewing
stellar populations with an older characteristic age in these
XMPs. These systems are lower in mass (as measured assuming a constant star formation history) than galaxies at
z > 6 with rest-frame UV metal line detections (109 –1010
M , e.g. Stark et al. 2015a,b; Mainali et al. 2017), but the
measured sSFR values extend into the range of values inferred for the general LBG population at z ∼6–8 (e.g. Labbé

Optical Spectra

A uniform set of publicly-available optical spectra were not
initially available for these XMPs, so we pursued observations with Blue Channel on the 6.5m MMT and the Echellete
Spectrograph and Imager (ESI, Sheinis et al. 2002) on Keck
II. The former provides access to the strong lines including the auroral [O iii] λ4363 line and critically the (blended)

[O ii] λλ3727, 3729 doublet missed by ESI. ESI provides a
high-resolution view of line complexes such as that near He ii
λ4686 which would otherwise be intractable to study with a
lower resolution grating.
We used MMT Blue Channel to observe the five northern targets on January 25, 2017. The systems were observed

at airmasses ≤ 1.5, and WFS measurements indicated seeing
was steady near 1.3 00 throughout the night. The observations
are summarized in Table 3. The data were taken with the 300
lines/mm grating, which provides continuous coverage over
3200–8000 Å with a dispersion of 1.96 Å/pixel. We utilized
HeAr/Ne lamp exposures for wavelength calibration. To obtain relative flux calibration sufficient for the measurement
of line ratios, we applied a sensitivity curve derived from
observations of the standard star G24-9. All observations
were conducted at parallactic to minimize slit losses. The
data were reduced using a custom python reduction pipeline,
which found arc solutions and performed overscan bias correction and flat-fielding, median-combination of the individual data frames, rectification, background subtraction, and
airmass-corrected flux normalization using the standard star
observations.
We also observed the five northern targets with ESI at
Keck II in January and February 2017. The exposure times
are summarized in Table 4, and average to 2 hours per target. Conditions were generally good, with typical seeing of
0.8 00 , 1.0 00 , and 1.1 00 on January 20, 21, and February 21
2017 (respectively). We utilized the 1 00 x20 00 slit, producing
spectra spanning 3900–10900 Å with 11.5 km/s/pixel dispersion. The standard set of HgNeXeCuAr arcs, dome flats,
and biases were conducted at the beginning of the night, and
archival sensitivity corrections were used to provide relative
flux calibration of our observations (we only report line ratios from these data). The continuum was sufficiently bright
to trace the object through the echelle orders directly, and
the spectra were extracted with a boxcar ensuring all object
flux was captured. We reduced these data with the ESIRedux
code3 .
One target (J0405-3648) resides at declinations inaccessible to MMT or Keck. For this object, we rely on optical line
measurements and metallicity found in a consistent manner
for the main body of the galaxy from a VLT/FORS2 spectrum by Guseva et al. (2009).
The strong optical lines constrain the physical conditions and composition of the ionized gas in these starforming regions. We measure emission line fluxes and restframe equivalent widths in the optical spectra as described
in S17, utilizing the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) to infer uncertainties in
these measurements. To correct for reddening in line measurements, we perform a two-step process, correcting first for
Galactic extinction using the maps of Schlafly & Finkbeiner
(2011) with the RV = 3.1 extinction curve of Fitzpatrick

(1999). We then estimate the residual intrinsic reddening
using the Balmer decrement relative to the Case B recombination value of Hα/Hβ = 2.86 (assuming Te = 104 K, ne = 103
cm−3 ; Draine 2011). We utilize the SMC bar average extinction curve measured by Gordon et al. (2003) for modeling
the intrinsic attenuation.
The corrected optical nebular lines reveal a range of gas
conditions prevail in these XMPs. The O32 = [O iii] λ4959
+ λ5007 / [O ii] λλ3727, 3729 ratios (Table 5), which correlates with the density of ionizing radiation in H ii regions,
varies from 0.6 in J0940+2935 (close to typical for local starforming galaxies in SDSS) to 10.3 in HS1442+4250, near the
largest values observed in the most intense star-forming regions (e.g. Senchyna et al. 2017; Izotov et al. 2017). The
equivalent width of Hβ, which correlates with specific star
formation rate and the degree to which the youngest stars
dominate the optical, ranges from 18–94 Å, corresponding
to sSFRs assuming constant star formation of 1–20 Gyr−1 ,
similar to the range found in Section 2.3.
With these de-reddened optical line measurements, we
can measure the gas-phase oxygen abundance using a direct
temperature estimate. We follow the procedure outlined in
Senchyna & Stark (2019) using the calibrations of Izotov
et al. (2006) to measure direct-Te oxygen abundances with

The gas-phase abundances range from 12 + log O/H = 7.38 –
7.70, corresponding to Z/Z ∼ 0.05–0.1 assuming solar abundances. Thus, our observations probe young stellar populations at metallicities approaching the lowest yet observed in
star-forming galaxies, Z/Z ' 0.02 (Izotov et al. 2018, and
references therein). Moderate-resolution ultraviolet spectral
constraints in this metallicity regime are nearly entirely absent (Section 2.1).

e.g. Crowther et al. 2006; Senchyna et al. 2017; Vidal-Garcı́a
et al. 2017) necessitated observations with the G160M and
G185M grisms coupled to the 2.5 00 diameter Primary Science Aperture (PSA). Our targets were selected to be bright
enough for high S/N continuum observation with one orbit
per grism, including an 88 second acquisition image taken in
the NUV with MIRRORA. An unexpected HST safing during observation of J0405-3648 resulted in an automatic reobservation, requiring two G185M exposures of this object.
After confirming that both achieved comparable signal-tonoise, we combined these two spectra for our analysis. We
plot these acquisition images in Figure 2, which reveal in
very high-resolution the structure of the star-forming regions
within the aperture. While centrally-concentrated, these images indicate that we are observing the conglomerate spectra
of several clusters spread over a ∼ 50–100 pc region.

We used the TIME-TAG observation mode with all
wavelength offset settings (FP-POS=ALL) and a wavelength calibration lamp exposure (FLASH=YES), minimizing the effects of fixed-patten noise in the detectors.
The data were reduced with CALCOS 3.2.1 (2017-04-28) and
the default calibration files as of 2017-08-11. The spectra
were extracted with the default parameters, namely with
the TWOZONE algorithm in the FUV and BOXCAR in
the NUV. The reduced spectra have dispersions of 73.4
mÅ/resolution element in G160M/FUV and 102 mÅ/resel in
G185M/NUV. We bin the one-dimensional specta via boxcar averaging over the length of these resolution elements
(or multiples thereof) to achieve higher S/N per pixel for
plotting and analysis. Typical binning over 3 resolution elements (as motivated by the measured width of MW absorption lines; Senchyna et al. 2017) result in an effective
spectral resolution of 40–50 km/s.

The spectra of our targets reveal a broad range of features, which we discuss on an object-by-object basis in Section 3.1. We present line flux and equivalent width measurements, performed as described in S17, in Tables 6 and 7,
respectively. We also plot the spectra in Figure 3, separated
into two panels representing galaxies with Hβ equivalent
widths > 50 Å (left) and < 50 Å (right). Nebular emission
in O iii] λ1666 is detected in all galaxies except J0405-3648,
and P-Cygni stellar absorption in C iv λλ1548, 1550 is visible
in all but SBSG1129+576.

RESULTS

In this section we present and analyze the new HST /COS
UV spectra collected for six XMPs in HST program
GO:14679. First, we describe the spectra of each object individually in the context of their optical data in Section 3.1.
Next, we investigate the range of UV nebular line equivalent
widths and line ratios attained by galaxies in this metallicity range in Section 3.2. Finally, we explore He ii emission
in these XMPs in Section 3.3, and the stellar C iv P-Cygni
feature in Section 3.4.

3.1

New UV Spectra Object-by-Object

The HST /COS FUV and NUV data we obtained alongside
deep optical integrations reveal a diversity of spectral properties in the XMPs targeted (Figure 3). Here, we describe
the UV spectra in the context of our other measurements for
each object individually, before physically interpreting these
observations in later sections.
HS1442+4250: This system is the optically-dominant
component of a ‘cigar-like’ extended light distribution (Figure 1), and presents the most intense optical emission line
properties in our sample. The intense Hβ emission (equivalent width 113 ± 5 Å) and high O32 ratio (10.3 ± 0.6) indicate this system harbors a very young stellar population and
highly-ionized gas. The UV spectra of this object are also
extreme: we detect strong nebular emission in all targeted
lines, with prominent emission in both C iii] at W0 = 11.6±0.6
Å and C iv at W0 = 4.38 ± 0.07 Å equivalent width. Narrow
He ii at nearly the flux of O iii] 1666 is also present. The
signal-to-noise in the continuum is sufficient to clearly detect a C iv P-Cygni profile as well; with the nebular emission and interstellar absorption subtracted-out by performing Gaussian fits to each component, the remaining broad
stellar absorption presents an equivalent width of −1.6 Å.
J0405-3648: The target region in this case is at the
center of the optical galaxy, but is somewhat more extended
than the other targets. The measured stellar mass of this
object at 105.3±0.2 M is fairly typical for the sample, but
the Hβ equivalent width of 18 Å measured by Guseva et al.
(2009) suggests a significantly less dominant young stellar
population in this system than the other targets (spanning
26–113 Å, Table 5). The UV spectra show no detections of
the target nebular lines (Figure 3), with 3σ limiting equivalent widths of < 2.6 Å for C iii] and < 0.3 Å for O iii] 1666.

J0940+2935: This system is a 104.9±0.2 M starforming complex with an extended tadpole-like tail. The
26 ± 1 Å equivalent width of Hβ in this system is also substantially smaller than in HS1442+4250 and closer to that of
J0405-3648, indicative of a much less dominant population
of massive stars. The UV spectra of this object reveal weak
nebular emission, with only O iii] 1666 detected (W0 = 0.7

J1119+5130: This system is relatively compact in
SDSS imaging, with stellar mass 106.4±0.2 M in the spectroscopic aperture and an Hβ equivalent width of 36 ± 2
Å just below the median for our sample. The UV spectra
reveal nebular emission in O iii] 1666 at W0 = 1.5 Å, but
non-detections of the other lines (with C iii] W0 < 0.8 Å).
C iv P-Cygni absorption is barely detected in J1119+5130,
at only −0.2 Å equivalent width.

Figure 3. HST /COS UV spectra of the 6 XMPs targeted in this program. We plot the three systems with Hβ equivalent widths < 50
Å in the left panel, and those with higher equivalent width optical emission on the right, ordered within each panel by gas-phase oxygen
abundance. All spectra are normalized by their flux at 1650 Å (the tick labels represent a separation of 2 in these normalized units)
and separated by an arbitrary vertical offset for display. Despite their low gas-phase metallicity and correspondingly weak stellar winds,
stellar C iv P-Cygni absorption is visible in most of the objects. The systems with high specific star formation rate and correspondingly
high equivalent-width optical emission reveal typically more prominent UV nebular emission, with emission in nebular C iv, He ii, O iii],
and C iii] detected.

SBSG1129+576: The targeted star-forming region in
this galaxy is situated at the end of an extended light
distribution, and contains a relatively large stellar mass
of 106.1±0.2 M with Hβ equivalent width 69 ± 2 Å. The
HST /COS data reveal narrow He ii 1640 emission at 1.14 ±
0.09 Å and O iii] 1666 at 0.95 ± 0.05 Å, but a nondetection of
C iii] (< 3.5 Å) and no detection of C iv P-Cygni absorption.
UM133: The targeted region in UM133 is a starforming complex at the end of an extended tadpole structure
(Figure 1). We infer a stellar mass of 105.9±0.2 M and measure an Hβ equivalent width of 85 ± 7 Å (the second largest
in the sample), suggestive of a system particularly dominated by young massive stars. The UV spectra of UM133
show prominent nebular emission in He ii, O iii], and C iii],
with the C iii] doublet measured at a very large equivalent
width of 11 ± 1 Å. C iv P-Cygni absorption is also visible, at
W0 = −1.3 Å.
3.2

UV Nebular Properties of the New XMPs

The moderate-resolution HST /COS observations described
above in conjunction with recently-acquired data with the
G140L grating (see Section 2.2) allow us to investigate the

production of UV nebular lines in this relatively unexplored
metallicity regime. In particular, understanding what governs the strength of the semi-forbidden C iii] doublet at primordial metallicities is of critical interest given the growing body of detections of and constraints on this line at
high redshift (e.g. Stark et al. 2014, 2015a; Jaskot & Ravindranath 2016; Stark et al. 2017; Ding et al. 2017; Du et al.
2017; Maseda et al. 2017; Nakajima et al. 2018, and references therein). Local observations have provided evidence
for an inverse trend in C iii equivalent width with metallicity, as strong > 5 Å C iii] emerges only at 12 + log O/H < 8.4
(Z/Z . 0.5) (Rigby et al. 2015, S17). Among the sample presented in S17, we found that very prominent nebular C iii] at equivalent widths > 10 Å is powered down to
12 + log O/H ' 7.8, and found some evidence that the maximum C iii] equivalent width may even increase down to this
limiting metallicity. However, we expect to eventually encounter a turnover in this trend. At sufficiently low metallicity, the harder stellar ionizing spectrum (leading to higher
C iv/C iii]) and the declining carbon abundance conspire to
suppress C iii], producing a peak in C iii] equivalent widths
with metallicity similar to that found for optical [O iii] emission (e.g. Jaskot & Ravindranath 2016). Testing this with
MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2019)

Extremely metal-poor galaxies in the UV
observations of XMPs is crucial to establishing an empirical
baseline for correctly physically interpreting high equivalent
width C iii] at high redshift.
Our sample of XMPs with new UV spectra includes
two with very prominent C iii] emission, HS1442+4250 and
UM133, both at an equivalent width of 11 Å. Emission at
this strength is rare among local star-forming galaxies at
any metallicity, as illustrated in Figure 4. Intriguingly, the
strong C iii]-emitters are the highest metallicity systems in
our new sample at 12 + log O/H = 7.65 and 7.70. The nondetection of C iii] in our lower-metallicity systems is at first
suggestive of a possible decline in C iii] equivalent widths at
12+log O/H < 7.6. However, the C iii] emitters HS1442+4250
and UM133 also host the highest specific star formation
rates of the systems we targeted. Their characteristic stellar ages from SED fitting are very young at 45 and 47 Myr,
and they present correspondingly large Hβ equivalent widths
(W0 = 94 and 81 Å, respectively). Thus, the apparent decline
in C iii] among our lowest metallicity systems is likely due
to their relative lack of ionizing flux from very young stellar
populations.
Examining the full set of XMPs confirms the importance of specific star formation rate in determining the
prominence of C iii] even at very low metallicity. In the right
panel of Figure 4, we replot the points at 12 + log O/H < 8.0
color-coded by the equivalent width of Hβ as measured in
an SDSS spectrum or comparable (Section A), which serves
as a proxy for specific star formation rate. Six XMPs at
12 + log O/H < 7.6 from Berg et al. (2016, 2019) power
Hβ at equivalent widths > 200 Å, and all six present C iii]
emission at equivalent widths of 11–16 Å comparable to the
strongest measured at any metallicity in the local Universe
(Figure 4, right panel). This suggests that we have not yet
observed a significant turnover in the strength of C iii] down
to 12 + log O/H ' 7.4. Rather, even at very low metallicities,
C iii] remains strong (& 10 Å) in systems characterized by
young effective stellar ages (< 100 Myr).
Nebular emission in C iv is also visible in the system with the most prominent young stellar population,
HS1442+4250. The C iv doublet is detected at a combined equivalent width of 4.4 Å. This is larger than any
of the extreme star-forming regions at higher metallicities
(12 + log O/H > 7.7) explored in S17, and is the fourth
largest of any nearby star-forming system in the literature
(see Section 4). The total observed flux of the C iv doublet in
HS1442+4250 is 0.6× that in C iii] even before correction for
dust extinction, illustrating that these emission lines can be
comparable in observed strength in local extremely metalpoor systems. We will investigate the C iv doublet and its
dependence on metallicity and sSFR in more detail in the
discussion (Section 4).
Due to their sensitive dependence on the slope of the
EUV ionizing spectrum, we might expect the ratios of the
UV nebular lines to clearly distinguish stellar from nonthermal ionizing sources at high redshift (e.g. Feltre et al. 2016;
Byler et al. 2018; Hirschmann et al. 2019). However, the
realization that stellar models presently underpredict the
strength of He ii emission in local star-forming galaxies and
the resonant nature of C iv have raised doubts as to whether
diagnostics involving these lines can be used, especially at
low metallicities. In Figure 5, we plot the dust-corrected ratios of O iii] λ1666/He ii λ1640 versus C iv λλ1548, 1550 /
MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2019)

He ii λ1640 for all XMPs presented here and in Berg et al.
(2016) and Berg et al. (2019) which have detections of the
relevant lines (Section A; we measure all lines and upper
limits consistently using our line fitting code). We overlay
photoionization models powered by AGN and stellar spectra
from Feltre et al. (2016) and Gutkin et al. (2016), respectively.
The XMPs presented here are still entirely disjoint
from the nonthermal models of Feltre et al. (2016) in
this diagnostic diagram, residing close to the purely stellar model ratios. All have dust-corrected He ii λ1640 fluxes
comparable to or smaller than O iii] λ1666, with only
one system (SBSG1129+576) presenting slightly stronger
He ii flux. While the O iii]/He ii ratios are only consistent
with star-forming models, the C iv/He ii upper limits for
SBSG1129+576 and UM133 place them at the bottom limit
of the star-forming models presented. This is suggestive of a
He+ -ionizing photon deficit in the stellar models considered,
which we will discuss further in Section 3.3. Despite this,
the general disagreement of our local XMPs with the nonthermal models and similar early results at z ∼ 6 (Mainali
et al. 2017) suggests that diagnostic diagrams such as this
one still have utility in distinguishing star-forming and AGN
systems even at very low metallicity, as long as the observations used are sufficiently high-resolution to disentangle
nebular and stellar wind features.
3.3

He ii Emission in the XMP regime

While the strength of C iv and He ii in these systems is inconsistent with a nonthermal power spectrum, the precise
origin of the He+ -ionizing photons remains unclear. Though
undisputed detections of nebular emission in He ii in predominantly star-forming systems at z > 6 remain elusive
(Sobral et al. 2015; Mainali et al. 2017; Laporte et al. 2017;
Shibuya et al. 2018; Sobral et al. 2019), we expect this
line to become very prominent in gas ionized by sufficiently
low-metallicity stars (e.g. Tumlinson & Shull 2000; Schaerer
2003; Raiter et al. 2010). Previous observations have revealed that many low-metallicity star-forming galaxies produce these hard photons much more efficiently than predicted by stellar population synthesis models (e.g. Shirazi
& Brinchmann 2012; Senchyna et al. 2017; Berg et al. 2018;
Kehrig et al. 2018) which suggests significant systematic uncertainties may arise in the interpretation of He ii emission
at high redshift. In particular, we found in S17 that the relative flux beyond the He+ -ionizing edge is strongly dependent
on metallicity, and suggests a dramatic upturn in the hardness of this ionizing radiation at low metallicities. Our new
data allow us to investigate whether this trend continues to
lower metallicities, which may provide insight into the origin
of this ionizing flux.
We detect He ii λ1640 in three of the six XMPs
presented here, at equivalent widths up to 1.7 Å in
HS1442+4250 (Table 7). The width of this He ii λ1640
emission (as measured with uncertainties using our MCMC
Gaussian fits without correction; Section 2.5) is found to
be as-narrow or narrower than that measured in [O iii]
λ1666 for the strongest He ii emitters, HS1442+4250 and
UM133, corresponding to FWHM' 80 km/s. Likewise, the
four Keck/ESI detections of He ii λ4686 (see Figure 6) reveal linewidths consistent with that measured for Hβ to

(HS1442+4250 and UM133) with strong 11 Å C iii] emission are also those with the highest equivalent width optical line emission (Hβ
equivalent widths > 80 Å), corresponding to a very prominent young stellar population. In the right panel, we replot those systems at
12 + log O/H < 8.0 with Hβ equivalent width measurements from SDSS or similar (Berg et al. 2016; Senchyna et al. 2017; Berg et al. 2019,
and Section A). The systems with prominent C iii] emission W0 > 10 Å also present high equivalent width Hβ emission in-excess of 100
Å, indicating that C iii] requires a stellar population weighted towards very young stars even in the XMP regime.

within 2σ in HS1442+4250, UM133, and J1119+5130. In
contrast, the He ii λ1640 emission in SBSG1129+576 is fit
by a single component with a substantially larger FWHM
of 253 ± 21 km/s, which indicates it likely arises in a stellar wind rather than ionized interstellar gas. The linewidths
measured for HS1442+4250, UM133, and J1119+5130 in the
high-resolution data strongly suggests that He ii emission in
these systems arises in gas similar to that which dominates
the emission in nebular Hβ and [O iii], rather than a stellar
wind or shocked outflow.
To assess the hardness of the ionizing radiation field
powering He ii emission in these XMPs, we examine the flux
ratio of He ii λ4686 / Hβ measured in the high-resolution
ESI data. This recombination line ratio tracks the ratio
Q(> 54.4eV)/Q(> 13.6eV), providing a relatively dust- and
model-insensitive probe of the relative amount of hard ionizing flux beyond the He+ -ionizing edge. In S17 we showed
this ratio was elevated in systems below 12 + log O/H < 8.0,
suggestive of an origin in low-metallicity stars; but this sample was limited to metallicities 12 + log O/H & 7.8. In Figure 7, we plot this flux ratio versus gas-phase metallicity for
the four new XMPs with nebular He ii constraints alongside
the galaxies presented in S17 and those in López-Sánchez &
Esteban (2009, 2010). The three XMPs in which we detect
apparently nebular He ii emission reveal flux ratios He ii/Hβ
= 0.020–0.036, indicating that the spectra of these systems
are harder at the He+ -ionizing edge than in all but one of the
higher-metallicity extreme star-forming regions presented in
S17.
Since the spread in metallicity among these three XMPs
is small (0.2 dex), other parameters are likely at play in
driving the large spread in He ii/Hβ. If the flux beyond
54.4 eV were powered primarily by very massive stars, we
would expect to see a correlation between this ratio and
specific star formation rate and thus Hβ equivalent width.
We have color-coded the measurements from all three sam-

ples in Figure 7 by WHβ,0 , which does not reveal a clear
trend among the XMPs in this plot between this equivalent
width and He ii/Hβ. The XMP with the largest Hβ equivalent width in this plot (SBS 1415+437 C with WHβ,0 = 222
Å, with measurements from López-Sánchez & Esteban 2009,
2010) presents a He ii/Hβ ratio of only 0.024 ± 0.002, slightly
smaller than that reached by J1119+5130 from our sample (He ii/Hβ = 0.026 ± 0.003) at a substantially smaller Hβ
equivalent width (36 Å). This suggests that while He ii emission is fairly ubiquitous at 12 + log O/H < 7.7, sources with
characteristic timescale longer than the lifetimes of the most
massive stars may be partly responsible for powering it (see
also Senchyna & Stark 2019). Binary mass transfer can produce stars through both stripping and angular momentum
transfer analogous to massive Wolf-Rayet stars with very
hot emergent spectra but at a much broader range of initial
masses and thus timescales (e.g. Eldridge & Stanway 2012;
Götberg et al. 2017, 2018). In addition, X-ray binaries may
power substantial flux at the He+ -ionizing edge (e.g. Fabbiano 2006; Schaerer et al. 2019), and fast-radiative shocks
may also produce sufficient soft X-ray flux to contribute to
He ii (e.g. Izotov et al. 2019). Distinguishing between possible sources will require a significantly expanded sample of
well-measured line ratios on which models can be tested,
especially at the lowest metallicities where this emission appears most common.

The C iv Stellar P-Cygni Feature

Thus far, we have focused on the gas-phase oxygen abundance O/H inferred from the direct method in the optical.
However, the ionizing spectrum produced by stars is dependent primarily on Fe/H in these stars. Variations away from
fixed solar abundance ratios can lead to significant variations in the effective stellar metallicity at fixed O/H. In parMNRAS 000, 1–17 (2019)

the star-forming sequence as well in the C iv/He ii ratio. This suggests that the He ii or C iv emission in this metallicity regime is
not fully captured by the existing models.

ticular, rising star formation histories can result in supersolar α/Fe ratios, which has been invoked to explain the
surprisingly low stellar metallicities inferred from spectra of
star-forming systems at z ∼ 2 (Steidel et al. 2016; Strom
et al. 2018). Thus, robustly connecting the inferences we
draw about the ionizing spectrum from the observed nebular emission to stellar models will require us to consider
carefully the metallicity of the stars present. By providing
access to metal features formed in the atmospheres of massive stars, ultraviolet spectra provide us leverage in assessing
the actual stellar metallicity. In particular, the stellar C iv
P-Cygni feature is formed in the outflowing winds of massive O and B stars, and is visible in five of our six spectra
(excepting SBSG1129+576; see Figure 3).
Since these stellar winds are assumed to be driven by
the opacity of Fe-peak elements, the strength of this P-Cygni
wind feature is highly correlated with the stellar metallicity (e.g. Crowther et al. 2006). After subtracting nebular
emission and interstellar absorption, the detected stellar absorption is found to vary in equivalent width from −1.9 to
−0.2 Å, with the two deepest features occurring in J04053648 (-1.9 Å) and HS1442+4250 (-1.6 Å). As expected, the
C iv P-Cygni feature is substantially weaker than the median
equivalent width of -3.2 Å measured in the sample of highermetallicity star-forming regions in S17. However, since the
strength of this feature is sensitive to both metallicity and
the exact mix of O and B stars present in the galaxy, we
must consider both metallicity and stellar population age to
derive stellar metallicity constraints from this feature.

The highest signal-to-noise detection of the P-Cygni feature is achieved in HS1442+4250, also the strongest nebular C iv emitter in our new sample of HST /COS-targeted

dust depletion in the gas-phase may increase the expected

those of the sample presented by S17 (Hβ equivalent widths ∼ 20–
100 Å versus 90–400 Å), we find large He ii/Hβ ratios indicative
of significant flux beyond > 54.4 eV relative to H-ionizing flux in
nearly all observed systems below 12+log O/H < 8.0 (Z/Z < 1/5).
This suggests that a metallicity-dependent source of hard EUV

most massive stars in these systems, though more data is needed

Gutkin et al. 2016).
If this system were as enhanced in α/Fe as found at
z ∼ 2 (i.e. by a factor of 4 times), we would expect to find
a stellar metallicity closes to Z = 0.0003–0.001. However,
the observed P-Cygni profile is substantially deeper than
the shallow absorption predicted at this low metallicity. In
addition, the continuum around this wind line shows some
indications of photospheric absorption in-line with that predicted by the higher-metallicity models but too faint to detect at Z = 0.0003. This suggests that this local C iv-emitter
has an α/Fe abundance much closer to solar than the enhanced values found at z ∼ 2 and expected in the reionization era. We will discuss the implications and caveats of this
finding in more detail in Section 4.

DISCUSSION

Over the last several years, the body of reionization-era systems with rest-UV line detections has grown steadily with
deep NIR spectroscopy campaigns. These efforts have revealed strong C iii] at equivalent widths up to 22 Å and C iv
at & 20 Å (Stark et al. 2015a, 2017; Mainali et al. 2017;
Schmidt et al. 2017). Early efforts to model these systems
indicate that this prominent high-ionization emission may
reflect the presence of very low metallicity stellar populations. If confirmed, these modeling efforts suggest that the
rest-UV might provide a means to identify extremely metalpoor systems in the reionization era. However, stellar models

on the C iv λλ1548, 1550 region. In addition to nebular emission, a
broad stellar P-Cygni profile is clearly detected in this source. For

matched to the measured Hβ equivalent width of this system at
various metallicities. This comparison reveals that the massive
stars in this system are inconsistent with the very low-metallicity
models corresponding to super-solar α/Fe ratios (Z ∼ 0.0003–
0.001), suggesting that the abundances are closer to solar than
expected in systems at z > 2.

suffer from substantial systematic uncertainties in the extremely metal-poor regime. Since the Local Group contains
no massive stars at Z/Z < 0.1, direct calibration of temperature scales and winds cannot be conducted for individual
stars at these metallicities. Stellar models at Z/Z < 0.1
are thus presently entirely theoretical, and predictions of
the ionizing spectrum and the nebular emission it powers
vary radically under different treatments of stellar evolution
and radiation-driven winds (e.g. Kudritzki 2002; Szécsi et al.
2015; Stanway et al. 2016). As a result, inferences about the
nature of the stellar populations or other ionizing sources
responsible for high-ionization emission in the reionization
era are extremely uncertain.
Nearby dwarf galaxies provide a way to address these
uncertainties in stellar population modeling at low metallicities. Ultraviolet and optical spectra at low redshift allow us to investigate the variation of high-ionization lines
with the metallicity and age of the underlying stellar population, providing empirical constraints on the ionizing spectra
of young metal-poor stellar populations. In Senchyna et al.
(2017), we presented moderate-resolution ultraviolet spectra
of galaxies dominated by recent (. 10 Myr) star formation,
spanning the metallicity range of 7.8 < 12 + log O/H < 8.5
(Z/Z ' 0.1 – 0.6). These data revealed nebular C iv only
in the lowest metallicity systems 7.8 < 12 + log O/H . 8.0,
with no detections even in the highest-sSFR systems at
12 + log O/H ≥ 8.1. However, the equivalent width of C iv in
this sample did not exceed 2 Å, an order of magnitude lower

than that measured at z > 6 (Stark et al. 2015b; Mainali
et al. 2017; Schmidt et al. 2017). If the appearance of nebular C iv at 12 + log O/H < 8.0 is due to a steepening of
the stellar ionizing spectrum with decreasing metallicity, we
might expect to encounter stronger emission in this doublet
at 12 + log O/H < 7.7.
Our new HST /COS spectra allow us to test whether
more prominent C iv is powered in extremely metal-poor
galaxies. Indeed, we detect nebular C iv at a combined equivalent width of 4.4 Å in HS1442+4250 (12 + log O/H = 7.65).
This C iv equivalent width is nearly three times larger
than the maximum observed among the S17 sample at
12 + log O/H > 7.7. In addition, the archival spectra we
have collated on XMPs (Section 2.1) reveal three additional star-forming systems with C iv emission at equivalent widths in-excess of 4 Å measured in lower-resolution
HST /COS observations (Berg et al. 2016, 2019), all at
metallicities 12 + log O/H < 7.7. Together with nondetections
at 12 + log O/H > 8.0 (Senchyna et al. 2017) these data suggest that nebular C iv is strongly metallicity dependent in
star-forming galaxies, and reaches equivalent widths > 4 Å
only in hot gas exposed to the hard stellar ionizing spectra
produced at extremely low metallicities (12 + log O/H . 7.7).
Given these results, we might expect to find C iv in most
star-forming galaxies at sufficiently low metallicity. Surprisingly, our data indicate that nebular C iv is far from ubiquitous even among XMPs. One possibility is that strong C iv
emission is powered only by very massive stars or other
short-lived sources of ionizing radiation, in which case we
would expect to see a trend with the effective age of the
stellar populations. To investigate this, we plot the equivalent width of nebular C iv versus WHβ,0 for the full sample
of XMPs with C iv constraints assembled from our sample
and the literature (see Appendix A) in Figure 9. Nebular
C iv is undetected in any XMPs with Hβ equivalent widths
< 100 Å, indicating that the ionization conditions required
to power strong C iv are reached only for galaxies dominated
by very young stellar populations (< 50 Myr). This full sample includes six systems with Hβ equivalent widths & 200 Å,
indicative of dominant star clusters of even younger characteristic age than in HS1442+4250 and closer to the most
extreme galaxies studied in S17 at higher metallicities. All
four of these galaxies are detected in C iv and one of the
youngest, J104457, powers C iv emission at an equivalent
width of 11 Å. This is by far the strongest C iv emission yet
identified in local star-forming galaxies, and demonstrates
that very young stellar populations at extremely low metallicity can power C iv at equivalent widths within a factor of
several of that found at z > 6.
While the strongest C iv arises from systems at 12 +
log O/H < 7.7 hosting very young stellar populations (characteristic ages < 50 Myr), these conditions are not alone sufficient. Even among XMPs at Hβ equivalent widths & 200 Å,
we observe WCIV,0 ' 1–11 Å in systems with C iv constraints
(Figure 9). This motivates a more detailed examination of
the massive stars present in C iv emitters, whose actual composition and other properties may differ substantially from
the simple picture inferred from the gas-phase oxygen abundance and WHβ,0 alone. In particular, the galaxy α/Fe ratio
may be an important factor in determining the strength of
C iv. In systems which have very recently started forming
stars rapidly, the buildup of iron and iron-peak elements in

the ISM and stars is delayed relative to that of the α elements such as oxygen. This is because type Ia supernovae
are the primary source of iron enrichment, and occur on
significantly larger timescales > 100 Myr than the type II
supernovae which dominate the production of α elements.
Since iron-peak elements are largely responsible for controlling the evolution and atmosphere opacities of massive stars,
this elevated α/Fe ratio results in a system with both a very
hard low-metallicity stellar ionizing spectrum and significant quantities of oxygen and carbon to excite into nebular
emission in the surrounding gas (see Steidel et al. 2016) —
likely ideal conditions for powering nebular O iii], C iii], and
especially C iv.
Variation in α/Fe and consequently the effective metallicity of the massive stars present could play a significant
role in driving scatter in WCIV,0 among high-sSFR XMPs.
Though the optical and UV spectra we have observed are
dominated by stars formed recently, many lines of evidence
indicate that even extremely metal-poor z ∼ 0 star-forming
dwarf galaxies have undergone multiple bursts of star formation over the past Gyrs (e.g. Tolstoy et al. 2009; Annibali
et al. 2013; Janowiecki et al. 2017) which may lead some
XMPs to values of α/Fe closer to and potentially below solar (e.g. Bouret et al. 2015). Our comparison of the C iv
P-Cygni profile in the spectrum of HS1442+4250 to stellar population synthesis models provides a first estimate of
this ratio among local nebular C iv emitters (Section 3.4).
Indeed, the stellar winds in this system appear too strong
to be consistent with the super-solar α/Fe abundance ratios
inferred at z ∼ 2–3 (Steidel et al. 2016; Strom et al. 2018).
Completing a coherent picture of nebular C iv production will require additional measurements of α/Fe and general massive star properties in other C iv emitters using
moderate-resolution ultraviolet spectra. Ideally, such spectra would be sufficiently deep to probe fainter photospheric
absorption features which provide more direct estimates of
Fe/H (e.g. Rix et al. 2004). If confirmed, a local trend be-

tween elevated α//Fe and enhanced C iv emission may also
naturally explain the apparent rarity of & 20 Å C iv among
local systems. At high redshift where galaxies are increasingly characterized by rapidly rising star formation histories,
we are likely to encounter very super-solar O/Fe ratios, as
already demonstrated at z ∼ 2 (Steidel et al. 2016). Extreme
values are likely even more common at z > 6 where the age
of the Universe approaches the typical timescale for onset
of Type Ia supernovae, and Pop III stellar yields become a
significant consideration (e.g. Takahashi et al. 2014). While
an accurate measurement of Fe/H in galaxies at reionizationera redshifts would be prohibitively expensive, strong wind
lines such as C iv will likely be accessible for the brightest
systems at z > 6 with JWST , enabling an independent check
on this model.
While further local work is necessary, the existing UV
data on local XMPs presented above already provide new
context for reionization-era spectral observations. One of
the key objectives of JWST and ground-based NIR spectroscopic campaigns targeting reionization-era systems is
the characterization of the stellar populations and physical
conditions in the earliest star-forming environments. While
prominent emission from ionized helium has long been suggested as a signpost of Population III star formation (e.g.
Partridge & Peebles 1967; Tumlinson & Shull 2000; Schaerer
2003), relatively little attention has been paid to the possibility of confirming the nonzero but likely very low metallicity of stars formed after this very first episode of enrichment. Based upon this local sample and samples at higher
metallicity (e.g. S17), detections of strong nebular C iv accompanied by UV line ratios inconsistent with a nonthermal spectrum appear to be a positive indicator of extremely
metal-poor . 0.1Z stars and gas. Indeed, the existing C iv
detections at or in excess of an equivalent width of 20 Å
(Stark et al. 2015b; Mainali et al. 2017) may be indicative
of both very metal-poor stars and significantly super-solar
α/Fe abundances. Nondetections of the high-ionization lines
at z > 6 are more difficult to diagnose, but larger samples
and deeper spectra in the local Universe will provide insight
into the full set of conditions which drive C iv strength at
low metallicities. Regardless, these data suggest that relatively inexpensive rest-UV emission-line spectroscopy with
JWST may provide significant insight into the early enrichment history of star-forming galaxies.

extremely metal-poor regime. Even at these metallicities,
our data suggests that strong C iii] still requires very high
specific star formation rates & 10 Gyr−1 .
(ii) We find strong nebular He ii emission in three of the
studied XMPs, with He ii/Hβ ratios indicative of relatively
more flux at 54.4 eV than in all but one of the higher
metallicity sources studied in S17. Despite this trend towards harder spectra at 12 + log O/H < 7.7, we do not find
a clear association between elevated He ii and WHβ,0 (Figure 7). This suggests that some source with characteristic
timescales longer than the age of the most massive stars
may contribute to the flux beyond the He+ -ionizing edge.
Additional data is needed to clarify this picture and distinguish between possible origins of this excess hard ionizing
flux.
(iii) We find nebular C iv at an equivalent width of 4.4 Å
in the highest-sSFR system in our sample, nearly three times
larger than the highest value found in star-forming systems
at 12 + log O/H > 7.7 in S17. Together with archival detections up to WCIV,0 = 11 Å in galaxies observed at lower spectra resolution (Berg et al. 2016, 2019), these data confirm
that strong C iv is clearly associated with both extremely
low metallicity and very young stellar populations < 50 Myr
(Figure 9). The body of UV spectral observations at z ∼ 0
suggest that strong nebular C iv emission is a promising indicator of massive very metal-poor stars at reionization-era
redshifts.
(iv) While XMPs dominated by metal-poor massive stars
appear capable of powering strong nebular C iv, the majority of such systems found locally do not produce emission
above 4 Å in equivalent width, well below the first measurements of this doublet in systems at z > 6. We suggest
that this discrepancy could be explained by variations in the
α/Fe abundance ratio. Our moderate-resolution spectra reveal stellar features in the 4.4 Å equivalent width nebular
C iv emitter which are inconsistent with a super-solar α/Fe
ratio (Figure 8). Given the  100 Myr timescales required
for significant iron enrichment, assembling galaxies at z > 6
may be significantly enhanced in α/Fe. Such systems host
both hot iron-poor stars which power hard ionizing spectra
and gas already moderately enriched in carbon, likely enhancing the strength of nebular C iv. Larger samples of high
quality local XMP spectra are required to test the impact
of α/Fe variations on high-ionization line emission.

SUMMARY

We presented new HST /COS UV spectroscopic observations
of 6 star-forming galaxies in the poorly-sampled metallicity
regime of XMPs. These data provide a clear view of stellar and nebular features at the transitions C iv λλ1548, 1550,
He ii λ1640, O iii] λλ1661, 1666, and C iii] λλ1907, 1909. Along
with all published archival UV spectra of XMPs, these data
allow us to conduct the first systematic analysis of highionization nebular line production at 12 + log O/H < 7.7
(Z/Z . 0.1), providing new insight into massive stellar
populations and gas conditions encountered at these very
low metallicities. Our conclusions are as follows:
(i) We detect C iii] at equivalent widths in excess of 10 Å
in systems at 12 + log O/H = 7.4–7.7 (Figure 4), confirming
that this doublet can remain very prominent well into the

Clearly, additional observations of XMPs hosting very
young stellar populations will be crucial for empirically calibrating stellar population synthesis models for the JWST
and ELT era. While these systems are rare among bright
XMPs uncovered by large spectroscopic survey programs
like SDSS, techniques to find XMPs dominated by young
massive stars have recently been developed (Hsyu et al.
2018; Senchyna & Stark 2019), and may substantially expand the horizons of this avenue of study when applied to
next-generation surveys such as LSST. While model constraints will require statistical analysis of large samples of
very well-understood nearby dwarf galaxies, such work may
eventually provide a firm physical grounding for inferences
about stellar populations in the reionization era.

of the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at
the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made
possible by the generous financial support of the W.M. Keck
Foundation. The authors wish to recognize and acknowledge
the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of Mauna Kea has always had within the indigenous
Hawaiian community. We are most fortunate to have the
opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain.

APPENDIX A: ARCHIVAL UV TARGETS
In Table A1, we have assembled UV line measurements for
all XMPs we located in published samples with constraints
on C iii]. Prior to HST /COS, only four XMPs were observed with UV spectrographs covering C iii]: I Zw 18 (with
three separate pointings targeting different subregions), SBS
0335-052, SBS 1415+437, and Tol 1214-277. These observations were detailed in the spectral atlas assembled by Leitherer et al. (2011). Unfortunately, these HST /FOS and
GHRS spectra did not cover C iv. As in S17, we ignore the
C iii] emitter Tol 1214-277, as the continuum is undetected
and results in a highly uncertain estimated C iii] equivalent width. We identified an additional fifteen systems at
MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2019)

Extremely metal-poor galaxies in the UV
12 + log O/H < 7.7 observed with HST /COS G140L presented in Berg et al. (2016, 2019) with constraints on both
C iii] and C iv. Gas-phase oxygen abundances are presented
from Leitherer et al. (2011) and Berg et al. (2016, 2019).
We measured C iii] and C iv equivalent widths in these
spectra using our spectral line-fitting tools described above.
However, note that at the lower resolution of G140L spectra
(R ∼ 2000), interstellar absorption and underlying stellar
wind contributions cannot be fully cleaned from the spectra
and may contaminate the nebular emission measurements.
We also cross-matched these spectra with SDSS as in S17,
and include measurements of Hβ equivalent widths where
an SDSS spectrum was available.

Table A1. UV and optical measurements of XMPs collated from the UV samples Leitherer et al. (2011, L11), Berg et al. (2016, B16),
and Berg et al. (2019, B19). Gas-phase oxygen abundances are drawn from the source reference, and Hβ equivalent widths were measured
uniformly from SDSS spectra of the regions where available. We present measured equivalent widths of both nebular C iii] and C iv or
corresponding 3σ upper limits derived using our line fitting techniques, noting that these low-resolution spectra cannot be cleaned of
underlying contamination from stellar or interstellar absorption near C iv.
