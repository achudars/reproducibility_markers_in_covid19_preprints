We address the problem of the persistence of entanglement of quantum light under mode transformations,
where orthogonal modes define the parties between which quantum correlations can occur. Since the representation of a fixed photonic quantum state in different optical mode bases can substantially influence the entanglement properties of said state, we devise a constructive method to obtain families of states with the genuine
feature of remaining entangled for any choice of mode decomposition. In the first step, we focus on two-photon
states in a bipartite system and optimize their entanglement properties with respect to unitary mode transformations. Applying a necessary and sufficient entanglement witness criteria, we are then able to prove that the class
of constructed states is entangled for arbitrary mode decompositions. Furthermore, we provide optimal bounds
to the robustness of the mode-independent entanglement under general imperfections. In the second step, we
demonstrate the power of our technique by showing how it can be straightforwardly extended to higher-order
photon numbers in multipartite systems, together with providing a generally applicable and rigorous definition
of mode-independent separability and inseparability for mixed states.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum states in composite systems, exceeding our understanding
of classical, i.e., separable, correlations [1]. For this reason,
early debates on the validity of quantum mechanics used such
quantum correlations to demonstrate the unique and distinct
aspects of quantum theory [2, 3]. Nowadays, quantum entanglement has evolved into a key resource for performing useful quantum computation and communication protocols [4, 5].
In particular, photonic systems constitute a versatile platform
which enables us to transmit quantum information between
distant parties [5–8]. However, as optical fields can be decomposed in a variety of fundamental modes, e.g., plane-wave and
Hermite-Gaussian bases, the encoding of quantum information in photons is not unique. Still, optical systems inherently
offer the advantage of being scalable because the number of
modes is not limited, rendering it possible to realize complex
forms of multipartite entanglement for quantum communication between multiple nodes of a network.
For the above reasons, entanglement theory is an exciting
field of research as it combines fundamental concepts with
applications in upcoming technologies [1, 4]. However, the
separability problem, i.e., deciding whether a state is separable, is also a sophisticated and computationally hard problem [9, 10]. Nevertheless, during the last decades, remarkable
progress has been made [1, 11]. This includes the theoretical classification of highly complex forms of entanglement in
multipartite systems [12–14], as well as experiments which
significantly widened the class of accessible states with interesting entanglement characteristics [15–20], where quantumoptical implementations are in many regards pioneering when
it comes to realizing, witnessing, and utilizing entanglement.
The notion of an entangled state changes with the choice of
the mode decomposition of quantum light, a property which
is discussed in more detail in the continuation of this work.
This is due to the definition of separability which presupposes
a given separation of degrees of freedom [21], which are in

our case the optical modes of the quantized radiation field.
Thus, a mode transformation can alter the quantum correlation properties of light from entangled to separable, and vice
versa [22–24]. Consequently, one has to ask oneself if there
exist states which are entangled regardless of the chosen mode
decomposition. In this paper, we provide a positive answer to
this question by deriving a constructive approach to states with
this very property.
Related obstacles occur when studying entanglement in
general quantum field theories, where different superposition
principles apply simultaneously. Thus, it is cumbersome to
distinguish classical interference from quantum-mechanical
ones. In quantum optics, for example, we can superimpose
modes and quantum states [25]. The former transformation is
a classical operation which is based on the linear structure of
Maxwell’s equations. The latter quantum superposition can
lead to entanglement when involving nonlocal states defined
over multiple modes. In fact, the confusion between classical and quantum superpositions and tensor-product structures
led to the unsuitably named concept of classical entanglement
[26, 27]. This confusion is further reinforced when considering classical mode transformations that can result in entanglement of initially separable states by altering the initial separation of degrees of freedom. For instance, this can be seen from
how one can generate entangled states from single-mode nonclassical states via general beam splitter transformations [22–
24]. This effect is, for example, used when two single photons
interfere in the Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment [28], which effectively corresponds to a mode transformation that results in
an entangled output state. Thus, a challenge is to find and certify stronger forms of entanglement which are independent of
classical interference, i.e., not subject to mode bases changes.
In this paper, we construct families of multiphoton states in
multimode systems which exhibit quantum entanglement for
arbitrary mode representations, defining the notion of modeindependent quantum entanglement (MIQE). Initially, in Sec.
II, we demonstrate that the definition of entanglement between
optical modes is indeed dependent on the choice of the optical

2
mode reference, leading to the observation that at least twophoton states are required to achieve our goal. By combining
photons which are defined in nonparallel and nonorthogonal
modes, we are then able to build up states with the desired inseparability properties in Sec. III. Furthermore, we optimize
the occurring free parameter to determine the state which remains maximally entangled regardless of the choice of mode.
Interestingly, the resulting state is not defined by uniformly
distributed Schmidt coefficients, which would be the case for
Bell-type states which are often considered to be maximally
entangled. A witnessing approach further enables us to verify
the MIQE characteristics and allows us to impose tight bounds
to perturbations which may diminish our specific quantum
characteristics. In Sec. IV, we generalize our approach to
multiphoton and multimode states. From this generalization,
we are then able to describe classes of states which are even
invariant under nonunitary mode transformations, and which
remain entangled under arbitrary partitioning of subsystems
that constitute various forms of entanglement, such as partial
and full inseparability. Based on our analysis for pure states,
we end our discussions with a rigorous definition of modeindependent separability for mixed quantum states in Sec. V,
which supersedes the commonly applied definition of separability in a fixed modal reference frame. In our concluding
discussion, Sec. VI, we also outline potential generalizations
to continuous-variable states and nonlinear mode transformations. Therefore, we develop a broadly applicable framework
to define, generate, and verify MIQE of light.

MODE DEPENDENCE OF ENTANGLEMENT
A.

Separability with respect to modes

The accepted definition of entanglement is based on rejecting the corresponding notion of classical correlation for separable states [21]. It is worth emphasizing that separability is
a property of a state, not a system. This means that it presupposes a quantum system and a given set of degrees of freedom. With respect to the latter degrees of freedom, a separation of the composite system into subsystems is possible that
ultimately defines the notion of a separable state [21]. For
simplicity, we restrict ourselves to bipartite systems, the parts
of which are labeled as 1 and 2, for the time being. In optical systems, the degrees of freedom are represented through
well-defined, orthogonal optical modes.
The definition of a separable state σ̂ is given in terms of the
possibility to write this state as a statistical mixture of pure
product states, |ψ (1) , ψ (2) i, as
Z

σ̂ =

dP(ψ (1) , ψ (2) ) |ψ (1) , ψ (2) ihψ (1) , ψ (2) |,

(1)

where P represents a classical probability distribution [21].
Conversely, for an inseparable, likewise entangled, state, ρ̂,
such a convex decomposition does not exist. Rather, P takes
the form of a distribution which includes negativities [29, 30];
see Ref. [31] for a recent experimental reconstruction of such

so-called entanglement quasiprobabilities. We also emphasize that a pure state |ψi is entangled when |ψi =
6 |ψ (1) , ψ (2) i
(1)
(2)
holds true for any |ψ i and |ψ i.
The optical modes we are considering are represented
through the annihilation operators â1 and â2 . A transformation between different, orthogonal mode decompositions is
described through a unitary map,
 
 
b̂1
â
=U 1 ,
(2)
â2
b̂2
where the annihilation operators of the resulting modes are
identified through b̂1 and b̂2 , and U is the unitary transformation matrix, U †U = id. A convenient representation of the
latter matrix for two modes is formulated in terms of transmission and reflection amplitudes, t and r, respectively, with
|t|2 + |r|2 = 1. For instance, we can then write
t â†1 + râ†2 = b̂†1 and t ∗ â†2 − r∗ â†1 = b̂†2

(3)

for the input-output relation of creation operators.
Since such a mode transformation acts globally on multiple
modes, it constitutes a nonseparable operation [32, 33]. Consequently, the definition of separability also changes in this
new reference frame. For instance, we have pure separable
(2)
(1)
states which are given by |ψi = |ψU , ψU i, where the index
U indicates that we operate in transformed degrees of freedom, i.e., a rotated mode basis. This notation is used throughout this paper. The ultimate aim of this paper is to construct
states which are inseparable for any mode decomposition.
As we are considering different mode decompositions, easily distinguishable notations are needed. For this reason, initial computational basis modes are labeled with “a,” unitarytransformed basis modes are labeled with “b,” and excited
modes to generate photons are labeled with “c.” The latter
concept is studied in the following.
B.

Failures

Before we construct the desired family of states, we may
consider specific examples and analyze why they cannot satisfy our demands. Obviously, the vacuum state |vaci =
|0, 0i = |0U , 0U i, having a total photon number of zero, is factorizable in any mode basis. That is, the vacuum state does not
have a preferred basis and exhibits no quantum correlations.
The next example is a pure single-photon state, which has
the general form


λ1,0 |1, 0i + λ0,1 |0, 1i = λ1,0 â†1 + λ0,1 â†2 |vaci,
(4)
which is entangled for nonzero Schmidt coefficients λ1,0 and
λ0,1 . Evidently, when choosing t = λ1,0 and r = λ0,1 for the
relations in Eq. (3), we can write the same state in the separable form, b̂†1 |vaci = |1U , 0U i. This representation confirms
the known observation that single-photon states can be transformed into separable states via an appropriate mode transformation, as well as the other way around; see, e.g., Ref. [34].

3
From the quantum-field-theoretic perspective, this transformation yields the superposition mode ĉ1 that is excited once
to result in the single-photon state under study, i.e., applying
ĉ†1 = λ1,0 â†1 + λ0,1 â†2 to vacuum, Eq. (4). In conclusion, we
can say at least two photons are required to achieve our goal.
Nevertheless, even in the case of more than one photon,
success is not guaranteed. Specifically, two forms of separability can occur in the scenario of two photons. First, we
can have both photons in the same mode, ĉ†1 = ĉ†2 = t â†1 + râ†2 ,
which yields
√
ĉ†1 ĉ†2
√ |vaci = t 2 |2, 0i + 2tr|1, 1i + r2 |0, 2i = |2U , 0U i. (5)
2
When U is chosen such that it rotates b̂1 = ĉ1 , we see that this
state is factorizable. The second option is that we have one
photon in each orthogonal mode, where ĉ†1 is chosen as before
and ĉ†2 = −r∗ â†1 + t ∗ â†2 . This results in states of the form
√
√
ĉ†1 ĉ†2 |vaci = − 2tr∗ |2, 0i + 2t ∗ r|0, 2i + (|t|2 − |r|2 )|1, 1i
=|1U , 1U i.
(6)
Again, this state is separable under the unitary mode transformation U.
For example, a symmetric splitting of the modes used
in Eq. (6) results√in a so-called NOON state [35], i.e.,
(|2, 0i + eiϕ |0, 2i)/ 2, for a local phase ϕ, and ignoring a
global phase. This state is entangled in the computational basis, i.e., with respect to the basis modes a. It also keeps its
form under some transformation, such as the eigenbasis of the
Hamiltonian that corresponds to the beam splitter processes
to generate this state. In particular, for any |t| = |r|, the above
equation preserves the NOON-type structure. Yet, this state,
which is obtained in the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference [28],
is separable as it is a result of two individual photons |1U , 1U i
which are combined on a general beam splitter represented by
U, which is formally represented through Eq. (6). Thus, this
specific NOON state is separable for some mode bases.
Therefore, we make the observation that a state the entanglement of which survives any classical mode transformation
must not be an element of one of the two families of separable
two-photon states in Eqs. (5) and (6).

MODE-INDEPENDENT INSEPARABILITY
Exciting nontrivially related optical modes

Because the above examples do not lead to states with the
desired MIQE properties, we have to focus on two-photon
states that excite optical modes which are nonparallel and
nonorthogonal. Thus, we propose states of the form
√
2|2, 0i + λ |1, 1i
† †
p
|Ψi = N ĉ1 ĉ2 |vaci =
,
2 + |λ |2
(7)
with ĉ†1 ∝ â†1 and ĉ†2 ∝ â†1 + λ â†2 ,

p
N = 1/ 2 + |λ |2 being a normalization constant such that
hΨ|Ψi = 1 holds true, and λ 6= 0 defining an arbitrary complex
number. This state can be physically described as the state of a
two-mode light field in which two photons live in nonparallel
and nonorthogonal modes, ĉ1 and ĉ2 for λ 6= 0.
This simple but effective mechanism of exciting photons
in nonparallel and nonorthogonal modes is the key concept
that enables us to construct states with MIQE. This can be
seen from the fact that any unitary transformations are going
to preserve this structure of the involved modes ĉ1 and ĉ2 .
Thus, as we rigorously demonstrate in the following, no modal
separation of the photons is possible.

B.

Witnessing mode-independent entanglement

For identifying entanglement in experiments, a convenient
approach can be formulated in terms of measurable entanglement tests [36–38]. Specifically, we employ a method related to entanglement witnesses in which bounds for separable
states are computed and that can be violated with entangled
states. Such entanglement criteria for a state ρ̂ read
tr(ρ̂ L̂) = hL̂i > g,

(8)

where L̂ represents any observable under study and g denotes
the maximal expectation value for separable states [37, 38],
g=

sup

tr(σ̂ L̂).

(9)

σ̂ separable

Note that, because of convexity, it is sufficient to maximize
over pure separable states, σ̂ = |ψ (1) , ψ (2) ihψ (1) , ψ (2) |. Moreover, the optimal expectation value g can be obtained by solving the so-called separability eigenvalue equations [38], similarly to obtaining the maximal expectations values for arbitrary states through eigenvalue equations.
Furthermore, for pure states, it can be shown that a viable
test operator corresponds to the projector which maps onto the
subspace spanned by the state |Ψi itself [38], i.e., L̂ = |ΨihΨ|.
As |Ψi is normalized, we have hL̂i = tr(|ΨihΨ|ΨihΨ|) = 1.
The bound for separable states g in Eq. (9) now provides a
necessary and sufficient entanglement test because g = 1 if
and only if |Ψi is separable [38], i.e., |hΨ|ψ (1) , ψ (2) i|2 = 1
when |Ψi = |ψ (1) , ψ (2) i. This is a result from the fact that
the maximal expectation value g of the projector L̂ is identical
with the maximal overlap of |Ψi with separable states [see Eq.
(9)]. Thus, we have for our choice of entanglement test and
pure states the entanglement condition
1 > g,

(10)

and separability is identified through hL̂i = 1 = g. In particular, g is the modulus square of the maximal Schmidt coefficient of |Ψi [38]. It is worth mentioning that any operator L̂
for which the eigenspace corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue contains the vector |Ψi, but no factorizable (i.e., separable) vector, works as well as the test operator L̂ = |ΨihΨ|
selected here.

4
We now apply our criteria to our family of states under
study in a transformed modal basis, which also impacts the
Schmidt decomposition. Inverting the transformation in Eq.
(3), i.e., â†1 = t ∗ b̂†1 + rb̂†2 and â†2 = t b̂†2 − r∗ b̂†1 , we can write the
state in Eq. (7) as
|Ψi = λ2,0 |2U , 0U i + λ1,1 |1U , 1U i + λ0,2 |0U , 2U i,

(11)

which is already in the Schmidt decomposition of photonnumber states |nU , 2U − nU i of the transformed modes, where
√
√ ∗ ∗
2t (t − λ r∗ )
2r(r + λt)
λ2,0 = p

,
2 + |λ |2
2 + |λ |2
and

λ1,1 =

2t ∗ r + λ (|t|2 − |r|2 )
p
.
2 + |λ |2

(12)

Indeed, we then get for the bound gU in the rotated basis
gU = max{|λ2,0 |2 , |λ1,1 |2 , |λ0,2 |2 } < 1,

(13)

for any choice of λ 6= 0; we refer to Appendix A for technical details. From the optimization over U performed there,
we also find that the maximal value for any choice of mode
coefficients t and r, i.e., unitary maps U, reads
(

1+|λ |2
1
1
gMI = max gU = max
+
,1−
. (14)
U
2
2+|λ |2
2+|λ |2
This mode-independent bound gMI now represents the maximal expectation value of L̂ for separable states with arbitrary
mode decompositions. Again, we can readily confirm via Eq.
(14) that gMI < 1 holds true for any |λ | 6= 0; see also the following application in Sec. III C.
More generally, we can conclude for generally mixed states
ρ̂ that, as long as
hL̂i = hΨ|ρ̂|Ψi > gMI

(15)

holds true, we have certified MIQE of the mixed state ρ̂. The
above inequality can be equally understood in terms of a minimal fidelity gMI of the state ρ̂ and the target state |Ψi which
has to be exceeded to ensure MIQE. Note that it is sufficient
to achieve this fidelity with any of the (transformed) states in
the considered class of pure two photons. We also emphasize
that this fidelity also provides a bound to imperfections which
can be tolerated in a realistic implementation.

C.

Optimal mode-independent entanglement

In Appendix A, we further determined the parameter λ for
which this bound gMI can be beaten with the largest difference
to one, the separable bound [see Eq. (10)]. We find that the
value
r 
√ 
|λ | = 2 1 + 2 ≈ 2.197
(16)

is optimal, where the phase arg(λ ) can be chosen arbitrarily.
This then gives a bound, i.e., minimal fidelity with the target
state |Ψi, as
√
2+ 2
gMI =
≈ 85.4%.
4

(17)

This certainly represents a comparably challenging bound, yet
not an infeasible one.
For example, one way to construct such a state is by using photon-addition protocols [39] and polarization degrees
of freedom, e.g., â1 and â2 corresponding to vertical and
horizontal polarization. In the first step, one adds a photon in horizontal polarization, approximating the c†1 = â†1 operation. Applying wave plates, the polarization is then rotated such that
p the horizontal component is mapped onto
(â1 + λ ∗ â2 )/ 1 + |λ |2 . Note that the optimal value of |λ |
given above corresponds to a rotation of ca. 65.5◦ . Finally,
performing another photon addition realizes the excitation of
a photon along this new horizontal polarization, ĉ†2 ∝ â†1 +λ â†2 .
Ideally, this produces the state as defined in Eq. (7). As long
as all imperfections one encounters in this state preparation
are below the threshold set by the fidelity 85.4%, a slightly
different state is generated which, however, exhibits the same
desired MIQE [see Eq. (15)]. See Ref. [40] for an in-depth
analysis of realistic photon-addition processes.
In Fig. 1, we compare different types of two photon states
to depict the results of our analysis. When the two photons are excited
√ in the same mode [see Fig. 1(a), where
ĉ1 = (â1 + â2 )/ 2 = ĉ2 ], separability can be observed for specific mode decompositions; when the two photons
√ are excited
in orthogonal modes
[see
Fig.
1(b),
where
ĉ
=
(
3â1 + â2 )/2
1
√
and ĉ2 = (−â1 + 3â2 )/2], separability also occurs for other
specific mode decompositions. In both scenarios, this can be
concluded from the fact that the fidelity of the state under
study with separable states becomes gU = 1 for specific angles
ϑ between the modes b̂1 and b̂2 . The latter modes define the
transformed degrees of freedom which, as we want to stress,
(1)
(2)
also change the definition of separability, |Ψi = |ψU , ψU i,
to this rotated system. However, when the photons are excited
along fields which are nonparallel and nonorthogonal, MIQE
is detected, gU ≤ gMI < 1. This scenario is shown in Fig. 1(c)
for the optimal choice of λ .
Let us make some extra remarks on Fig. 1 and the twomode, two-photon case. Because of maximal and minimal
values occurring only for Im[λtr∗ ] = 0 (see Appendix A), we
set without a loss of generality t = cos ϑ and r = sin ϑ for our
choice λ ≈ 2.197. It is also worth emphasizing that√the optimal choice of λ yields the state |Ψi ∝ |2, 0i + [1 + 2]|1, 1i,
which has nonuniformly distributed Schmidt coefficients and
is therefore not a Bell-type state. Furthermore
it is worth men√
tioning that, for |Ψi = (2 + |λ |2 )−1/2 ( 2|2, 0i + λ |1, 1i) in
the limits |λ | → 0 and |λ | → ∞, we retrieve the parallel and
orthogonal two-photon cases, respectively.

FIG. 1. MIQE test, gMI < 1. The top row depicts the modes in which each of the two photons is excited, where arrows indicate ĉ†1 and ĉ†2 and
the basis modes are â1 and â2 , respectively. The entanglement test gU < 1 in the bottom row is performed with respect to the unitary mode
decomposition b̂1 = cos ϑ â1 + sin ϑ â2 and b̂2 = − sin ϑ â1 + cos ϑ â2 . Column (a) corresponds to photons which are excited along the same
mode [see Eq. (5) for a 45◦ rotation]. Column (b) describes photons which are excited in perpendicular modes [see Eq. (6) for a 30◦ rotation].
Column (c) shows photons which are excited in modes with an angle of 65.5◦ between them, constituting the optimal mode-independent
scenario, cf. Eqs. (7) and (16). While being entangled (gU < 1) for most angles in the cases (a) and (b), the states are indeed separable
(gU = 1) for some angles ϑ (e.g., ϑ = 45◦ and ϑ = 60◦ ), resulting in gMI = 1 (dashed lines). By contrast, we have a finite offset (gray area)
for the scenario (c), with gU ≤ gMI < 1 [see also Eq. (17)], proving the state’s inseparability regardless of the mode decomposition.

Generalization

1.

Based on our previous considerations, we can now generalize the procedure to obtain states with MIQE. For doing so,
we consider N photon states in M modes, described through
âl for l ∈ {1, . . . , M}. Specifically, we excite the kth photon
(k ∈ {1, . . . , N}) according to
ĉ†k =

M

∑ Γk,l â†l ,

(18)

l=1

where vectors (Γk,l )l∈{1,...,M} that describe the excited field
modes are linearly independent but not orthogonal. This results in the construction of the state
|ΨM,N i = N

ĉ†1 · · · ĉ†N |vaci.

(19)

In principle, we can then proceed as discussed for the
case of two photons in two modes. In particular, the entanglement analysis with respect to unitary transformations of
†
modes, â†l = ∑M
j=1 Ul, j b̂ j , can be performed and optimized.
For this purpose, it is helpful to recall that the generated states
in the rotated basis always exhibit a decomposition with the
(1)
(M)
transformed photon-number states |nU , . . . , nU i restricted to
(1)
(M)
N = nU + · · · + nU , which is convenient for constructing
entanglement witnesses as done before but for a multipartite
system [41, 42]. In the following, we discuss a few interesting
examples in more detail; see Appendix B for a full algebraic
characterization of the general case.

Examples

Three photons in two modes

As a first example, we study a state which goes beyond two
photons but still remains in the two-mode case. Thus, we set
M = 2 and N = 3 and consider
|Ψ2,3 i =N â†1 (â†1 + â†2 )(â†1 + iâ†2 )|vaci
√
3|3, 0i + (1 + i)|2, 1i + i|1, 2i
√
=
.

(20)

Similar to the two-photon case, we can observe that this
state exhibits entanglement regardless of the choice of unitary
mode transformations because we have pairwise nonparallel
and nonorthogonal excitation, ĉ†1 = â†1 and ĉ†2 = â†1 + â†2 , as
well as the additional component ĉ†3 = â†1 + iâ†2 .
In addition to this, we can even exclude general linear transformations [i.e., elements of the general linear group GL(M)]
for this state, which exceed the set of unitary transformations
[i.e., U(M) ( GL(M)]. This can be seen from the fact that,
even if we consider ĉ1 and ĉ2 as a nonorthonormal mode basis, we still have to express the third mode as a superposition of the former ones, ĉ3 = (1 + i)ĉ1 − iĉ2 . This results in
|Ψ2,3 i 6= |2U , 1U i and |Ψ2,3 i 6= |3U , 0U i for any unitary and
general linear transformation U. Thus, the three-photon state
|Ψ2,3 i is even invariant under general linear transformations.

Two photons in three modes

Now, we may focus on more than two modes. For example,
N = 2 photons could be distributed over M = 3 modes, such
as
|Ψ3,2 i =N â†1 (â†1 + â†2 + â†3 )|vaci
√
2|2, 0, 0i + |1, 1, 0i + |1, 0, 1i

(21)

This state can be used to demonstrate properties which are
genuine to multimode entanglement.
For this purpose, we consider
√ the unitary basis transforma√
tion b̂1 = â1 , b̂2 = (â2 + â3 )/ 2, and b̂3 = (−â2 + â3 )/ 2.
Then, we get
|Ψ3,2 i =

|2U , 0U , 0U i + |1U , 1U , 0U i

Three photons in three modes

Consequently, we may consider three excitations in three
modes, M = N = 3. For instance, we can have a state like
|Ψ3,3 i = N â†1 (â†1 + â†2 )(â†1 + â†2 − â†3 )|vaci

√
− 2|2, 0, 1i + 2|1, 2, 0i − |1, 1, 1i).

So far, we mainly focused on pure states in our analysis.
But the definition of a separable state includes mixed ones
[Eq. (1)] that are described as statistical mixtures of pure
product states [21]. In addition to this, we allowed for unitary
transformation of modes to discern states that are entangled
regardless of the choice of modal decomposition from those
which are separable in at least one mode basis.
To reflect the latter feature, we may propose an alternative
approach for defining separability of states which is modeindependent. Namely, we say a state σ̂MI exhibits modeindependent separability if it can be represented as a statistical mixture of pure states which are separable under mode
transformations. Therefore, we may describe such states in
the two-mode scenario as

(22)

In this basis, we can see that the state of the third system fac(3)
(3)

as we have a state as given in Eq. (7) for λ = 2, hence

separable in a mode-independent manner at the same time.

where P is a probability distribution over not only product
states but also unitary mode transformations U.
In comparison to separability for a fixed separation of
modes in Eq. (1), the revised notion of mode-independent
separability in Eq. (24) is based on states for which it is sufficient that they are separable in one mode decomposition. This
also means that a state ρ̂MI can be entangled with respect to
some mode bases. For example, a mixture of the states with
different total photon numbers, each being separable in a different mode basis, is separable with respect to definition (24)
but entangled for each basis choice, following, for example,
from the partial transposition criterion [43], which is a special case of the approach in Ref. [38]. Finally, definition (24)
straightforwardly generalizes to arbitrary multimode scenarios and is not restricted to any fixed photon numbers.

(23)

As no unitary mode decomposition can separate this state, not
even partially, because of the nonparallel and nonorthogonal
nature of all three generated photons, this state is entangled
with respect to mode-independent full and partial separability.
More generally, we require M ≤ N for achieving MIQE
with respect to any mode partitioning. See Appendix B in this
context and for the general characterization of |ΨM,N i using
the QR decomposition, being more suitable for MIQE than
the Schmidt (likewise, singular value) decomposition. Furthermore, a suitable test operator for these multimode states
is L̂ = |ΨM,N ihΨM,N | for which the bounds for partial and full
separability can be obtained in a similar fashion as demonstrated for the bipartite case [41, 42]. Thus, the general approach, given by the excitation of photons along linearly independent and nonorthogonal modes as described in Eq. (18)
and resulting in the state in Eq. (19), extends the concept
of MIQE straightforwardly to the multimode and multiphoton
scenario.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We devised a technique to construct photonic quantum
states which exhibit inseparability that does not depend on the
modal decomposition, where the individual modes define the
separate parties. For this purpose, we considered multiphoton
states in general multimode systems and analyzed how their
entanglement transforms under unitary mode transformations.
By combining photons which are, interestingly, defined over
nonparallel and nonorthogonal modes, we were able to formulate states with the desired entanglement properties.
Using a witnessing approach, we were further able to derive universal bounds for the considered families of states that
verify entanglement for any choice of basis modes in terms of
fidelities. For the specific, yet fundamental case of two photons distributed over two modes, we explicitly discussed the
optimal case for getting the most robust state with MIQE. In
particular, it was found that the two involved photons are excitations of modes with an angle of 65.5◦ between them. We
discussed potential realizations of this scenario by employing

7
polarization degrees of freedom and photon-addition protocols. This certifies that one can, in principle, generate photonic states with entanglement properties which do not require
any specific optical-mode basis. This is in contrast to the typical scenario in which entangled photonic states are considered
that are, however, separable for some choices of modes [34].
Beyond the essential example of two photons distributed
in two modes, we showed that our MIQE method is easily
scalable to multiple photons and multimode light fields. For
instance, we showed that one can build three-photon states in
two modes, which are entangled when performing not only
unitary mode transformation but arbitrary linear transformations of modes. Moreover, we analyzed how the number of
photons in multimode systems affects the potential to generate
different forms of partial and full entanglement. Specifically,
we found that the number modes must not exceed the number
of linearly independent, but nonparallel photons which need
to be excited to generate a state which is entangled with respect to arbitrary forms of multipartite entanglement.
Here, we deliberately choose to restrict ourselves to states
defined over finite-dimensional subspaces [44] with a fixed
photon number for introducing the concept of MIQE, which
was later completed with the general definition of modeindependent separability and inseparability. The latter definition is stronger than the typical applied definitions in the
sense that it leads to quantum correlations which are decoupled from the representation of an optical state in a specific
mode basis. Thus, MIQE represents a previously unknown
flavor of global quantum correlations that is independent of
mode superposition as allowed by classical optics.
In the future, one might additionally analyze, for example, families of continuous-variable states in detail. The twomode case suggests, however, that non-Gaussian states are required to obtain MIQE, similarly to the demanded resources
for realizing universal quantum computation [45]. This observation follows from techniques similar to the ones presented here [41] to analyze separability for Gaussian states
under mode transformations, which additionally shows how
our method can be adapted to other scenarios beyond states
probed here. This fact follows similarly from the BlochMessiah and Williamson decomposition; see Ref. [46] in this
context. In addition, one could extend the range of operations, e.g., to general symplectic operations (i.e., multimode
squeezing), which are considered as classical [47] to analyze
even more robust forms of entanglement. It would be also interesting for upcoming studies to investigate how nonorthogonal and nonparallel excitations of quantum fields generalize
to fermionic systems and other bosonic field theories as one
would expect that similarly universal entanglement features
as introduced here might appear in such systems.
In conclusion, we established a method to construct and analyze states of light with MIQE. As outlined above, our approach has the potential to inspire future research and might
be accessible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques.
Furthermore, and because of the mode independence and scalability, the constructed families of multiphoton states can
also lead to previously inconceivable quantum communication protocols which exploit this unique resource of MIQE.

Appendix A: Optimal two-photon, two-mode case

Based on the Schmidt coefficients in Eq. (12), we define
three functions,
Λ2,0 =|λ2,0 |2 =

2|t|2 (|t|2 +|λ |2 |r|2 −2Re[λtr∗ ])
,
2 + |λ |2

(A1a)

Λ2,0 =|λ2,0 |2 =

2|r|2 (|r|2 +|λ |2 |t|2 +2Re[λtr∗ ])
,
2 + |λ |2

(A1b)

Λ1,1 =|λ1,1 |2 =

4|t|2 |r|2 +|λ |2 (|t|2 −|r|2 )2
2 + |λ |2
+

4(|t|2 −|r|2 )Re[λtr∗ ]
.
2 + |λ |2

(A1c)

In the following, we optimize these expressions to find a λ
which minimizes gMI in Eq. (13) for arbitrary t and r. In this
context, recall that gU itself is defined via a maximum of Λ2,0 ,
Λ0,2 , and Λ1,1 [38].
A first observation we can make is that the above functions
jointly take optimal values if Im[λtr∗ ] = 0 holds true. Thus,
without loss of generality, we can suppose that t, r, and λ are
real numbers. Conversely, because of |t|2 + |r|2 = 1, we set
t = cos[ϑ ] and r = sin[ϑ ]. Now, we can rewrite the functions
under study as
1 (1 + cos[2ϑ ] − λ sin[2ϑ ])2
,

(sin[2ϑ ] + λ cos[2ϑ ])2
.
Λ1,1 =
2+λ2
Λ2,0 =

(A2c)

From the derivative of each function, and for the optimal
cases (i.e., vanishing derivatives), we then get optimal arguments ϑ through the relations
either λ = −

sin[2ϑ ]
cos[2ϑ ]
or λ =
.
cos[2ϑ ]
sin[2ϑ ]

(A3)

For these two cases, and after some algebra, we get gMI , i.e.,
the maximum of our functions, as

gMI = max

We further want to know in which case gMI is minimal for
any mode transformation. As both values that determine gMI

8
have opposite monotonic behaviors and the minimum thereof
is required, we consider the point at which both expressions
are identical.
For simplicity, we may introduce the substitu√
tion x = 1 + λ 2 , which is greater than one because of λ 6= 0.
This then gives two solutions,√
one of which does not satisfy
x > 1, leaving us with x = 1 + 2.
From those considerations, we now obtain the optimal
value of λ . Its amplitude reads
r 
√ 
|λ | = 2 1 + 2 ,
(A5)
while the phase can be chosen arbitrarily. The resulting λ
then also defines the optimal state via Eq. (7) and the√modeindependent lower bound for separability, gMI = (2 + 2)/4.

such that T = QR. For us, this means that we can identify
Γ = (Γk,l )k∈{1,...,N},l∈{1,...,M} = T † [Eq. (18)], the mode transformation U = Q† , and the lower triangular matrix ∆ = R† ,
which gives the QR decomposition as
Γ = ∆U.

Furthermore, it does not make a difference to exchange the
excitations, ĉ†k ĉ†k0 = ĉ†k0 ĉ†k , which allows us to sort the rows of Γ
such that Γk = (Γk,l )l∈{1,...,M} for k can be sorted in such a way
that Γk either is linearly dependent on Γk0 for k0 < k or represents a linearly independent vector to all previous ones. Note
that potential elements with ĉk = 0 (i.e., Γk = 0 represents a
row of zeros) can be discarded without a loss of generality.
Using this sorting, the structure of ∆ from the QR decomposition takes a generalized lower triangular form, either

Here, we characterize states of the form (19), with excited

where “∗” represents an arbitrary entry. The last entry “∗” in
each row is nonzero; see the constructive proof in Ref. [48]
for the QR decomposition for details. In connection with separability, we can also easily observe that a QR decomposition
of the individual components ΓA,A and ΓB,B in Eq. (B1) is
possible in the same manner.

where Γ j, j ∈ CN j ×M j for j ∈ {A, B}.

2. QR decomposition

The QR decomposition of a matrix T ∈ CM×N is an algebraic tool to analyze our states, represented through the rectangular matrix Γ. See, e.g., Ref. [48] for details on the QR decomposition. The QR decomposition theorem states there is a
unitary Q ∈ CM×M and an upper triangular matrix R ∈ CN×M

Conclusions

From the prior general analysis, we can deduce some special cases of particular interest. First, if there is a zero column
[see Eq. (B3)], the respective mode can be separated as a
factor |0U i. In this case, we have at least partial separability. Such a zero column always exists for M > N. Second,
if all Γk are linearly independent, also meaning M = N, the
size of each block of rows in Eqs. (B3) and (B4) is one. This

9
also means that we have a strictly lower triangular (defined by
nonzero diagonal entries) [48]. The same applies to the QR
decomposition of the individual blocks in the case that Eq.
(B1) applies, further implying M j = N j for j ∈ {A, B}.
Finally, assume that we have performed a QR decomposition for N = M linearly independent mode vectors that are
pairwise nonorthogonal, and we attempt to perform a bipartition into A and B via
 anotherunitary V . In this case, we
∆
0
may decompose ∆ = ∆A,A
∈ CM×M . Therein, ∆A,A ∈
B,A ∆B,B
CMA ×MA and ∆B,B ∈ CMB ×MB for some MA + MB = M are
strictly lower triangular because of linear independence, and
∆B,A 6= 0 holds true because of the pairwise nonorthogonal
nature. The unitary map to be constructed

may be also deVA,A VB,A
composed in this block form V = VB,A
VB,B .

Since ∆A,A is a quadratic, strictly lower triangular matrix, the

VB,A = 0

Using the above relations, Eq. (B5b) then implies that ∆B,A =
0 has to be true. This, however, contradicts the nonorthogonality requirement, ∆B,A 6= 0. This proves that the desired
unitary V for the separation of A and B does not exist.
Also note that the more general case M > N [see Eq. (B4)]
follows equivalently. This can be easily shown by taking the
N rows which start a new block (i.e., are linearly independent
from the previous rows) and considering the N × N submatrix
in the same way as done for the case above, where M = N.
