Abstract
Geometric optimization and electronic properties of Stone-Wales defective
antimonene nanotubes are calculated by the method of first -principle calculations
based on density functional theory. Various nanotubes are investigated according to the
possible orientations of zigzag/armchair nanostructures when Stone-Wales defects are
formed. The band structures, partial density of states and atomic orbitals are calculated
to reveal the mechanism of influence of Stone-Wales defects on antimonene nanotubes.
When the structure of antimonene changes from monolayer to tube, the indirect gap
semiconductor antimonene transforms to a direct gap one. Moreover, the character of
direct band gap for the antimonene nanotube is preserved with the Stone-Wales defect
forming, while the energy of conduction band bottoms change duo to the intervene of
the defect energy level in the band gaps. These results may provide valuable references
to the development and design of novel nanotubes based on antimonene nanotubes.
Keywords: Stone-Wales defect; antimonene; nanotube; electronic properties;

1. Introduction
Stimulated by the amazing properties of graphene, scientists have shown great
interest in other two dimensional (2D) monolayer materials. Silicene,hexagonal boron
nitride, molybdenum disulfide, phosphorene and germanene et al have received
increasing attention owing to their unique properties and promising applications[1-19].
Recently, a new ultrathin 2D semiconductor materials in group-V, namely, antimonene,
has been grown by van der Waals epitaxy[20].
Defects such as vacancies, adsorption and topological defects, existing inevitably in
the fabrication and processing of the two dimensional monolayer materials, may affect
dramatically the physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials[1-11]. Stone-Wales
(SW) defect being a typical defect which is comprised of two pairs of five-membered and
seven-membered rings formed by rotating one bond of the traditional six-membered
ring by 90°[21] , have been extensively investigated in graphene and carbon nanotubes
[22-27]
. While to the best of our knowledge, there are still no investigations on the
structural and electronic properties of antimonene nanotube with SW defects.
In this paper, the geometrical structures as well as electronic property of both
pristine and SW defective antimonene nanotube are investigated using the density
functional theory calculations. Four possible structural defects are considered:

SW1-ZSbNT; SW2-ZSbNT; SW1-ASbNT; SW2-ASbNT. The formation energy of a SW defect
are calculated and compared with that of the SW defect in silicene, indicating excellent
stability. It is found that the characters of direct band gap for the antimonene nanotubes
are preserved with the Stone-Wales defect forming, while the energy of conduction
band bottoms change duo to the intervene of the defect energy level in the band gaps.
2. Computational methods
The models for the zigzag/armchair antimonene nanotubes(SbNTs) are
established(shown in Fig.1 (a)(b)), under the reference of V. Nagarajan's research[28].
There are placed in the center of a cubic supercell. The diameters of zigzag antimonene
nanotubes(ZSbNTs) and armchair antimonene nanotubes(ASbNTs) are 17.742Å and
15.579Å, respectively. In order to eliminate the interaction between the adjacent images,
the supercell lengths in the plane perpendicular to the direction in which the nanotubes
extend are set as 19.031Å and 14.420Å. The side length of the supercell is consistent
with the length of the nanotube. The electronic properties and structural optimization
of antimonene nanotubes are carried out by using the density functional theory
method(DFT)[29], within the generalized gradient approximation of the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)[30] as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation
package (VASP)[31]. The convergence criteria are determined by the energy, stress and
displacement of each atom, which are set as less than 2×10^-3eV, 0.5eV/Å and 5×10^-3Å.
The self-consistent force and energy convergence limit is set to be 0.002eV/Å and 10-6,
while optimizing zigzag and armchair antimonene nanotubes[32]. Lengths of the Sb-Sb
bonds in the optimized structures vary in a small range, while changing from nanosheets
to nanotubes.

There are two possible orientations of nanotube structures that Stone-Wales
defects are formed on zigzag or armchair nanotubes with a particular length and
diameter. In a two-dimensional single-layered antimonene, Stone-Wales defect is
defined that a pair of Sb atoms are rotated by 90° to form a topology of two
five-membered and two seven-membered rings. The orientation of a Stone-Wales
defect can be described by the Sb-Sb band original direction. In the antimonene sheet,
each Sb atom is connected to three surrounding atoms to form a stable six-membered
ring similar to graphene[33]. This results in the orientation of the Sb-Sb bonds in three
different directions(shown in Fig.2 (a)(b)). When the zigzag nanotubes are formed, due
to the symmetry of the nanotubes extending in the axial direction, the three
orientations of the bonds may become axial(Sb1-Sb2) and non-axial(Sb1-Sb3,Sb1-Sb4).
Similarly, according to the orthogonality between the armchair-type and the zigzag-type,
the orientations of Stone-Wales defects are divided into perpendicular to the axial
direction(Sb1-Sb2) and intersect with the axial direction(Sb1-Sb3,Sb1-Sb4). The electronic
properties and structural optimization of those models are based on the same methods.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structures of Stone-Wales defective antimonene nanotubes
The optimized structures of Stone-Wales defective antimonene of zigzag and
armchair nanotubes is shown in Fig.3 respectively. The antimony atoms in the
antimonene are hybridized with sp2 and sp3 to form a stable hexagon ring structure, so
that all atoms of the monolayer are not in the plane[34]. Armchair and zigzag antimonene
nanotubes exhibit a low-buckling structure with highly anisotropic corrugations in which
adjacent rows of Sb atoms are alternately wrinkled in the armchair and zigzag directions,
respectively[35]. The presence of warped structure makes the surface of the antimonene
nanotubes uneven, and it can be clearly seen that the Sb atoms are divided into two
layers. In order to prevent obvious deformation of the connection between adjacent Sb
atoms, the diameter of the nanotubes must be sufficiently large to avoid the
interference between the inner Sb atoms. Therefore, the appropriate nanotube
structures that are stable in the presence of Stone-Wales defects are used for the
research. Fig.3 illustrates the Stone-Wales defective zigzag and armchair nanotubes after

geometric optimization. Stone-Wales defect converts the four adjacent hexagons
(6-6-6-6) into two pentagons and two heptagons (5-7-7-5). In contrast to the perfect
nanotubes, the position of the atoms around the defect changes significantly, especially
as the atom is closer to the defect, the greater the displacement is. Defects have a
certain degree of symmetry, and the direction can be determined by the pair of Sb
atoms in which the two heptagons coincide. We set the direction of the Sb-Sb bond at
the center of the defect to be the orientation of the defect[36]. The orientation angles of
these defects are 20.969°, 32.307°, 49.556°, and 11.815°, respectively. Due to the
warped structure of the antimonene, the structure of the defect is irregular. The
pentagon and hexagonal structures exhibit a spatial configuration that intermingles
adjacent rows of Sb atoms alternately wrinkled, but the length of the band and the
angle of the Sb-Sb band vary within a small range to maintain the stability of the whole
nanotubes.

3.2 Formation and stability of Stone-Wales defect in antimonene nanotubes
According to the formation mechanism of defects, the atomic vacancies or the
transfer of atomic positions may cause the atom missing or the hybridization of bonds is
changed significantly, result that the total energy of the crystal structure changes
dramatically. However Stone-Wales defect is relatively easy to form because it preserves
the distance between the atoms and the bonding modus consistent with the former. We
calculate the formation energy to study the degree of stability of the defective

structure[37]. The formation energy is defined as the prerequisite energy when
nanotubes form the Stone-Wales defect calculated as the discrepancy between the total
energy of the perfect structure and the defect structure. The value of the formation
energy(Ef) can be estimated as Ef=Ed-Ep, where Ed and Ep are the total energy of defective
and perfect nanotubes respectively. We list the formation energies for the Stone-Wales
defects of ZSbNT and ASbNT in Table1. The formation energy of these structures are
lower than that on graphene[38] and silicene[39], which indicates the Stone-Wales defect
is easier to form for the antimonene nanotubes. The defects are sensitive to their
orientations and type of nanotubes[40]. For the zigzag antimonene nanotubes, the
defects of 20.969° and 32.307° have the lowest and highest formation energies. This is
mainly due to the rolling-up strain of the Stone-Wales defect. The small orientation
angle represents a large angle between the axis of the ZSbNT and the rotated Sb-Sb
bond, which results in lower rolling-up strain and formation energy. Similar results can
be found in the study of Stone-Wales defects in CNTs[41].In contrast, for the armchair
nanotubes orthogonal to ZSbNTs, the formation energy of 49.556° is larger than that of
11.815° because of the original Sb-Sb band is vertical with axial.

3.3 Electronic structures of the perfect and Stone-Wales defective antimonene
nanotubes
The bulk structure of Sb is a typical semimetallic material, the single layer of
antimonene is an indirect semiconductor and the antimonene nanotube is a direct gap
semiconductor(shown in Fig.4 (a)(c))[42]. For the zigzag antimonene nanotubes, the band
gaps of two nanotubes with SW defects are slightly smaller than that of the perfect
nanotube. The defects of SW1-ZSbNT and SW2-ZSbNT narrow the band gap of the
ZSbNT in values of 0.153eV and 0.085eV, respectively. It is noted that the conduction
bands move toward low energy range because of the SW defect formation. Due to the
complexity of the bonding mode for Sb atoms in the defective area, the valence bands
of the defective nanotubes are more concentrated[43]. As shown in Fig.4 (a), for the
perfect antimonene, the electrons in the periphery of Sb atoms form a stable structure
by sp3 hybridization, in which each Sb atom forms a σ bond with three antimony atoms
in the surrounding, and a pair of electrons are separated from the structure to form the
π bond. The band energy near Fermi of the antimonene nanotube is consistent with Sb

5p states and 5s states. The partial density of states for various orbitals are presented,
which suggests that the electrons of 5p orbitals accounted for the major contribution.
This is similar to the case of the density of states of a defective nanotube(shown in Fig.4
(b)(c)). The high similarity in band structures and density of states between the pure
ZSbNT and defective ZSbNTs indicates that the Stone-Wales defect has little effect on the
electronic structure of the antimonene nanotube, and no significant differences can be
found in their electronic properties. This indirectly confirms that the difference of the
total energy between perfect and defect structures is small and the length and angle of
Sb-Sb bonds are not significantly changed when the defect is formed(shown in Table1).
With the same setting for calculating the properties of the ZSbNTs, the electronic
properties of the perfect and defective armchair antimonene nanotubes are
calculated(shown in Fig.4 (d)(e)(f)). The same conclusion can be obtained in the
nanotubes for armchair.

To further investigate the properties of the defective structures, electron density
isosurfaces near Fermi are calculated(shown in Fig.5)[44]. The defect energy level near
Fermi surface comprises the valence band maximum(VBM) and the conduction band
minimum (CBM), concentrated on a pair of Sb atoms in the center of defective region.
The p states of atomic orbitals contribute more to the highest-energy valence band and
lowest-energy conduction band.

4. Conclusions
The first-principle calculations based on density functional theory are perfumed to
study the geometric structures and electronic properties of Stone-Wales defective
antimonene nanotubes. Stone-Wales defect converts the four adjacent hexagons into
two pentagons and two heptagons. Four nanotubes are investigated according to the
possible orientations of the defects. The formation energies and structures of banding
suggest the stability of Stone-Wales defect in antimonene nanotubes. We investigate
the mechanism with defects forming by calculating band structures, density of states
and atomic orbitals. The antimonene nanotube is a direct gap semiconductor and the
influence of defects on electronic properties are inconspicuous. Our researches reveal
the characteristics of antimonene nanotube with defect forming, which are significant
for the applications of low-dimension nanostructures of antimony on nanoelectronic
devices.
