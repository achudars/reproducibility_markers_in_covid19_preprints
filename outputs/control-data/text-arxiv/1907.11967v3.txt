Abstract. Let E benthe Sierpinski gasket, i.e., the self-similar
o set
x+a
generated by the IFS fa (x) = q : a ∈ {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)} . In
paper, we provide a description of the following set for 2 < q < 3
Dq = {dimH (E ∩ (E + t)) : t ∈ T },
where T is the set of t = (t1 , t2 ) with t ∈ E − E and t1 , t2 have
unique q-expansions w.r.t {−1, 0, 1}.

1. Introduction
The Siepinski gasket in R2 is defined as follows:
(∞
)
X ci
(1.1)
E=
: ci ∈ Ω1
qi
i=1

where Ω1 := {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}, which is a self-similar set generated
by the iterated function system (IFS)
x+a
with a ∈ Ω1 , x ∈ R2 ,
fa (x) =
q
S
i.e., E = a∈Ω1 fa (E).
In the past twenty years many works have been devoted to the Siepinski gasket; e.g., see [2, 12, 16]. Sidorov [16] discovered for q ∈ (1, 2)
the IFS {fa : a ∈ Ω1 } fails the open set condition. Furthermore, for
q ∈ (1, 3/2] the Sierpinski gasket coincides with its convex hull. However, for q ∈ (3/2, 2] descriping the sturcture of this set becomes difficult. When q = 2, the IFS satisfies the open set condition, but does not
satisfy the strong separation condition. When q > 2, the IFS satisfies
the strong separation condition (cf. [4]).
In this paper we investigate the intersection of E with its translation
under the assumption 2 < q < 3. In this case, the IFS {fa : a ∈ Ω1 }
satisfies the strong separation condition hence the Hausdorff dimension
of E dimH E = log 3/ log q (cf. [4]).

One can check that
E ∩ (E + t) 6= ∅ if and only if t ∈ E − E,
where the difference set E − E = {x − y : x, y ∈ E}. According to (1.1)
we can rewrite the difference set as

where

Ω2 = Ω1 − Ω1
= {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (−1, 0), (−1, 1), (0, −1), (1, −1)} .
Hence, for any t ∈ E − E, there exist at least one (ti ) ∈ ΩN2 such that
t=

The above sequence (ti ) is called a q-expansion of t with respect to the
digit set Ω2 in base q. Note that t may have multiple expansions. On
the other hand, for any t ∈ E − E, we have (cf. [14])
(∞
)
[ X

(1.2)
E ∩ (E + t) =
: ai ∈ (Ω1 ∩ (Ω1 + ti )) ,
qi
i=1
(ti )

where (ti ) takes over all possible q-expansions of t with respect to (the
digit set) Ω2 .
For each ti ∈ Ω2 , we denote ti = (ti,1 , ti,2 ) where ti,1 , ti,2 ∈ {−1, 0, 1}.
Thus for t ∈ E − E with an expansion (ti ) ∈ ΩN2 one has

So we know that if (ti ) is an expansion of t = (t1 , t2 ) with respect
to Ω2 , then (ti,1 ), (ti,2) are the expansions of t1 and t2 with respect
to Ω3 := {−1, 0, 1}. We say two sequences (ti,1 ), (ti,2) ∈ ΩN3 are Ω2 matched if (ti,1 , ti,2) ∈ ΩN2 for all i ≥ 1.
Note that 2 < q < 3, which implies that

Thus each s ∈ Iq := [−1/(q − 1), 1/(q − 1)] has at least one q-expansion
with respect to Ω3 . This kind of expansions in non-integer base q was
first studied by Rényi [15]. Since then many results on q-expansion

3

have been discovered. We denote by Uq the set of s ∈ Iq which has a
unique q-expansion with respect to Ω3 . Now let t = (t1 , t2 ) and
T = {t ∈ E − E : t1 , t2 ∈ Uq }.
In this paper, we try to determine the set
Dq := {dimH (E ∩ (E + t)) : t ∈ T } .
This is motivated by a recent work of Baker and Kong [1]. They
Pmainly
xi
studied the set {dimH (F ∩ (F + s)) : s ∈ Uq }, where F = { ∞
i=1 q i :
xi ∈ {0, 1}}.
Before we state our result, first let us introduce some notation. Let
A := {a1 , a2 , a3 } be a set of consecutive integers with a1 < a2 < a3 , for
a word w = b1 · · · bn ∈ An we write
w − := b1 · · · bn−1 (bn − 1) if bn > a1 ,
w + := b1 · · · bn−1 (bn + 1) if bn < a3 ,
w ∞ := www · · · ,
and |w| denotes the length of w. Next we recall some results which are
useful in this paper. Komornik et al. [3, 7, 8, 9, 10] discovered that
there exist a smallest base qKL (called the Komornik–Loreti constant)
in which 1 has a unique q-expansion with respect to {0, 1, 2}, and a
bases sequence (qn )∞
n=1 . Actually qn is the base which 1 has a greedy
expansion of the form wn 0∞ . We define recursively a sequence of words,
starting with w1 = 2
wn+1 := (wn wn )+ ,

n = 1, 2, . . .

where the reflection of wn with respect to {0, 1, 2} is defined as wn =
b1 · · · bn = (2 − b1 ) · · · (2 − bn ). Then from the definition above we know
that (qn ) is strictly increasing and has the limit qKL , for details we refer
the reader to [3].
Now we state our main result.

The remaining part of this paper is arranged as follows. In next
section, we introduce some results needed for our proof. The proof of
Theorem 1.1 is given in section 3.
2. Review of some preliminary results
We first recall the classical Thue–Morse sequence (τi )∞
i=0 , τ0 = 0,
τ2i = τi and τ2i+1 = 1 − τi . This sequence begins with
0110 1001 1001 0110 · · · .
N
Now we introduce the sequence (λi )∞
i=1 ∈ Ω3 (see [1, 10])

λi = τi − τi−1 ,

(2.1)
which starts with

10(−1)1 (−1)010 (−1)01(−1) 10(−1)1 · · · .
By (2.1) we have the following property
(2.2) λ1 = 1,

λ2n+1 = 1 − λ2n , λ2n +i = −λi

for all 1 ≤ i < 2n .

For n = 0, 1, 2, · · · , let
(2.3)

εn = λ1 · · · λ2n .

Associating (2.2) with (2.3), the following simple properties can be
verified directly:
(P1) ε0 = 1 and εn+1 = εn εn + , where εn = (−λ1 ) · · · (−λ2n ) is defined
as the reflection of εn with respect to Ω3 ;
(P2) ε2n+1 ends with 0, ε2n ends with 1;
(P3) εn is the block of length 2n . εn contains 0 for all n ≥ 1;
(P4) εn begins with 1. The odd term of εn is nonzero. There exists
0 < 2k < 2n such that the 2k-th term of εn is nonzero when n ≥ 3.
Recall that
Uq = {s ∈ Iq : s has unique expansion w.r.t Ω3 } .

The authors [11, 13] gave a crucial characterisation of the set Uq′ .
Lemma 2.3. Let q ∈ (qm , qm+1 ] with m ≥ 1. Then each element of
Uq′ \ {(−1)∞ , 1∞ } ends with one of
0∞ , (ε0ε0 )∞ , (ε1 ε1 )∞ , (ε2ε2 )∞ , · · · , (εm−1 εm−1 )∞ ,

and let ε−1 ε−1 := 00, for each integer 0 ≤ n ≤ m there exists an
element of Uq′ \ {(−1)∞ , 1∞ } ends with (εn−1 εn−1 )∞ .
Lemma 2.4. Each element of Uq′KL \ {(−1)∞ , 1∞ } is either eventually
periodic with one of following period
0∞ , (ε0 ε0 )∞ , (ε1ε1 )∞ , (ε2 ε2 )∞ , · · · ,
or ends with the sequence of the form
(ε0 ε0 )j0 (ε0 ε1 )l0 (ε1 ε1 )j1 (ε1 ε2 )l1 · · ·
and its reflection, where
lm ∈ {0, 1}

and 0 ≤ jm < ∞ for all m ≥ 0.

Moreover, for each nonnegative integer n there exists an element of
Uq′ \{(−1)∞ , 1∞ } ends with (εn−1 εn−1 )∞ , and for each pair of sequences
(li )i≥0 , (ji )i≥0 where li ∈ {0, 1} and 0 ≤ ji < ∞, there exists an element
of Uq′ \ {(−1)∞ , 1∞ } ends with
(ε0 ε0 )j0 (ε0 ε1 )l0 (ε1 ε1 )j1 (ε1 ε2 )l1 · · · .

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1
It follows from Lemma 2.1 that the key to the proof of Theorem 1.1 is
to describe the set T in order to obtain Dq . For sequences (xi ), (yi ) ∈
N
ΩN3 and ((xi , yi ))∞
i=1 ∈ Ω2 , we use ((xi ), (yi )) to denote the sequence
((xi , yi ))∞
i=1 . The following lemmas are helpful for characterizing T .
Lemma 3.1. Let n ≥ 1 and let σ be the left shift in ΩN3 .
(i) If i = 2n , then
i
En,m
:= (σ i ((εn εn )∞ ), (εn εn )∞ ) ∈ ΩN2

and this sequence contains infinitely many (0, 0).
i
(ii) Given arbitrarily 0 < i < 2n+1 and i 6= 2n . Then En,m
does not
i
contain (0, 0) when i is odd. And when i is even En,m ∈
/ ΩN2 .
Proof. (i) Note that
n

2
En,n
= (σ 2 ((εn εn )∞ ), (εn εn )∞ )

= ((εn εn )∞ ), (εn εn )∞ ) ∈ ΩN2 .
n

2
By (P3) we know that En,n
contains infinitely many (0, 0).
i
(ii) We infer from (P4) that En,n
does not contain (0, 0) when i is
odd. So suppose that i is even. Then the odd terms in σ i ((εn εn )∞ )
pair the odd terms in (εn εn )∞ . We focus on the odd terms in (εn εn )∞ .
By doing it, let us remove the even terms in (εn εn )∞ . Let
n

An := (ai )21 , ai = λ2i−1 .
By (2.2) we have a1 = 1, A1 = 1(−1), Ak+1 = a1 · · · a2k+1 = Ak Ak ,
where Ak = (−a1 ) · · · (−a2k ). Let
i
Dk,k
:= (σ i ((Ak Ak )∞ ), (Ak Ak )∞ ).
i
We claim that Dk,k
contains (−1, −1) or (1, 1) for all 0 < i < 2k+1 and
k
i 6= 2 . We prove it by induction. First we observe that

(A1 A1 )∞ = (1(−1)(−1)1)∞ ,
(A2 A2 )∞ = (1(−1)(−1)1(−1)11(−1))∞ ,

When k = 1, D1,1
and D1,1
contain (−1, −1). When k = 2, D2,2
contains (−1, −1) for all i 6= 4, which can be verified directly. We
i
assume that Dk,k
contains (−1, −1) or (1, 1) for all i 6= 2k and some
i
k = r ≥ 3. Then we have to show Dr+1,r+1
contains (−1, −1) or (1, 1)
r+1
for all i 6= 2 . Applying (3.1) for each i1 6= 2r , we see the block of
i1
length (2r , 2r ) of Dr,r
in which (−1, −1) or (1, 1) locates (see Figure
i2
1) will be rearranged in Dr+1,r+1
(we denote by (|a|, |b|) the length of

7

block A = (a, b) ∈ Ωn2 ), we split into four cases (see Figure 2). For
k = r + 1, the cases i = 2r and 2r+1 + 2r , one can check directly by
i
Figure 2. Hence Dk,k
contains (−1, −1) or (1, 1) for all 0 < i < 2k+1
and i 6= 2k . We complete the proof by the fact that there exist two odd
i
integers u, v such that (λu , λv ) = (−1, −1) or (1, 1), and En,n
contains
n+1
n
(λu , λv ) for all 0 < i < 2
and i 6= 2 .

Lemma 3.2. Let n ≥ 3. Then for each 0 < i < 2n+1 , there exists
0 < u < 2n+2 , u 6= 2n+1 such that the u-th term of

(σ i ((εn εn )∞ ), (εn εn + εn ε−

Proof. For simplicity, denote
∞
Γi := (σ i ((εn εn )∞ ), (εn εn + εn ε−
n ) ).

For a sequence α = a1 a2 · · · and positive integer m ≤ n, let α(m, n) =
am · · · an . We divide the proof into three cases.
Case I. 0 < i < 2n . In this case either the segment Γi (2n − i + 1, 2 ·
n
2 − i) or the segment Γi (3 · 2n − i + 1, 4 · 2n − i) contains (1, 1) or
(−1, −1).
In fact, both these two blocks have the same upper part but the
lower part of the former segment is the reflection of the lower part of
the latter segment. More exactly, if we denote
Γi (2n − i + 1, 2 · 2n − i) = (c1 · · · c2n , d1 · · · d2n ),
then
Γi (3 · 2n − i + 1, 4 · 2n − i) = (c1 · · · c2n , d1 · · · d2n ).
On the other hand, when i is even, each odd term (c2s−1 , d2s−1 ) satisfies
c2s−1 d2s−1 6= 0. When i is odd, there exist 2s such that c2s d2s 6= 0 by
(P4) (see Figure 3).

or (−1, −1). This can be reduced by the same way as in Case I (see

Remark. The conclusion of Lemma 3.2 is still correct if εn εn + εn ε−
n is
replaced by εn εn + εn εn .
Recall that
i
En,m
= (σ i ((εn εn )∞ ), (εm εm )∞ ).
We have the following

Lemma 3.3. Let m ≥ n ≥ 1. There exists some 0 < i < 2n+1 such
i
that the sequence En,m
∈ ΩN2 if and only if m = n.
Proof. Let m = n. The sufficiency follows from Lemma 3.1(i).
i
Now suppose that n < m. It suffices to show that the sequence En,m
contains either (−1, −1) or (1, 1) for all 0 < i < 2n+1 . This can be
directly verified for n = 1, 2. Let n ≥ 3. Note that when n < m, the
sequence (εm εm )∞ begins with
εn εn + εn ε−
n

or εn εn + εn εn .

From Lemma 3.2 and the consequent remark it follows that the sei
quence En,m
contains either (−1, −1) or (1, 1) for all 0 < i < 2n+1 . 
Applying Lemmas 2.3, 3.1 and 3.3 we have the following results.
Lemma 3.4. Let q ∈ (qm , qm+1 ], m ≥ 1 and t ∈ T with q-expansion
(ti ) = ((ti,1 ), (ti,2 )). Suppose that (ti,1 ), (ti,2 ) ∈
/ {(−1)∞ , 1∞ }. If (ti )
contains infinitely many (0, 0), then either one of (ti,1 ) and (ti,2 ) ends
with 0∞ or (ti ) ends with ((εn εn )∞ , (εn εn )∞ ) for some 1 ≤ n < m.
Remark. We omit the cases (ti,1 ) or (ti,2 ) can end with (ε0 ε0 )∞ =
(1(−1))∞ under the assumption of Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5, otherwise (ti )
will contain at most finitely many (0, 0).
Proof. Suppose that (ti,1 ), (ti,2 ) ∈
/ {(−1)∞ , 1∞ }. It is important that
(ti ) contains neither (−1, −1) nor (1, 1).
From Lemma 2.3 it follows that (ti,1 ), (ti,2 ) end with one of
0∞ , (ε1 ε1 )∞ , (ε2 ε2 )∞ , · · · , (εm−1 εm−1 )∞ .
Assume that both (ti,1 ) and (ti,2 ) don’t end with 0∞ . Let (ti,1 ) ends
with (εα εα )∞ , and (ti,2 ) ends with (εβ εβ )∞ . Lemma 3.3 implies that

10

YI CAI* , WENXIA LI

t = (ti ) ends with (σ i (εα εα )∞ , (εαεα )∞ ). Since (ti ) contains infinitely
many (0, 0), then Lemma 3.1 implies that i = 2α , so
(σ i (εα εα )∞ , (εα εα )∞ ) = ((εα εα )∞ , (εα εα )∞ ).
Note that ending with a tail of ((εα εα )∞ , (εα εα )∞ ) is equivalent to
ending with a tail of ((εα εα )∞ , (εα εα )∞ ).

Lemma 3.5. Let q = qKL , t ∈ T with q-expansion (ti ) = ((ti,1 ), (ti,2 )).
Suppose that (ti,1 ), (ti,2 ) ∈
/ {(−1)∞ , 1∞ }. If (ti ) contains infinitely many
(0, 0), then either one of (ti,1 ) and (ti,2 ) ends with 0∞ or (ti ) ends with
((εn εn )∞ , (εn εn )∞ ) for n ≥ 1.
Proof. Let q = qKL and t ∈ T with q-expansion (ti ) = ((ti,1 ), (ti,2 )).
Suppose that (ti,1 ), (ti,2 ) ∈
/ {(−1)∞ , 1∞ } and (ti ) contains infinitely
many (0, 0). We distinguish two cases.
Case I. (ti,1 ) or (ti,2 ) ends with 0∞ . We assume that (ti,1 ) ends with
∞
0 . Then by Lemma 2.4 (ti,2 ) ends with one of
0∞ , (ε1 ε1 )∞ , (ε2 ε2 )∞ , · · · ,
or ends with the sequence of the form
(3.2)

(ε0 ε0 )j0 (ε0 ε1 )l0 (ε1 ε1 )j1 (ε1 ε2 )l1 · · ·

and its reflection, where
lm ∈ {0, 1}

and 0 ≤ jm < ∞ for all m ≥ 0.

Case II. (ti,1 ) and (ti,2 ) do not end with 0∞ . By Lemmas 2.4, 3.1 and
3.3 it remains to consider the cases that (ti,1 ) ends with one of
(ε1 ε1 )∞ , (ε2 ε2 )∞ , · · · ,
and (ti,2 ) ends with the sequence having the form of (3.2), and both
(ti,1 ), (ti,2 ) end with the sequence having the form of (3.2).
II (i). (ti,1 ) ends with (εn εn )∞ for some n ≥ 1 and (ti,2 ) ends with
the sequence of the form of (3.2).
Note that εn+2 = εn εn + εn εn appears infinitely often in (ti,2 ), because
εm begins with εn+2 for all m ≥ n + 2. It follows from Lemma 3.2 and
the consequent remark that (ti,1 ) and (ti,2 ) are not Ω2 -matched, which
leads to contradiction.
II (ii). Both (ti,1 ) and (ti,2 ) end with the sequence of the form of
(3.2). We choose k1 , k2 large enough such that (ti+k1 ,1 ) and (ti+k2 ,2 )
begin with one of the following blocks for some large positive integer n

11

and denote by C1 = An−1 An−1 An−1 An−1 , C2 = An−1 An−1 An−1 An−1 the
new blocks. It follows from (3.4) that there are C1 C1 , C1 C2 , C2 C1 , C2C2
four cases. Next we consider the case (σ i (C1 C2 ), C1 C2 ) for 0 < i < 2n+1
(see Figures 1 and 6, let k = n − 1 in Figure 1), for the cases i =
2n−1 , 2n , 2n−1 + 2n , one can check directly by Figure 6. The remaining
fifteen cases are similar. Hence (ti,1 ) and (ti,2 ) are not Ω2 -matched,
which leads to the same contradiction.

The following result was proved in [13, p. 2829] (see also [1, Lemma
3.5]).
Lemma 3.6. Let q ∈ (qKL , 3), then there exists n ∈ N such that Uq′

contains the subshift of fnite type over the alphabet A = an , bn , an , bn
with transition matrix

where an = 0λ1 · · · λ2n −1 and bn = (−1)λ1 · · · λ2n −1 .
For reader’s convenience, we restate our result.

(iii) If q ∈ (qKL , 3), Dq contains an interval.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let t ∈ T with q-expansion (ti ) = ((ti,1 ), (ti,2 )).
If (ti,1 ) or (ti,2 ) is in {(−1)∞ , 1∞ }, then one gets that 0 ∈ Dα , so we
assume that (ti,1 ) and (ti,2 ) are not in {(−1)∞ , 1∞ } and (ti ) contains
infinitely many (0, 0).
(i) Let q ∈ (qm , qm+1 ] for some m ≥ 1. By Lemma 2.3, (ti,1 ) and (ti,2 )
is eventually periodic. It follows from Lemma 3.3, (ti ) = ((ti,1 ), (ti,2 ))
is a sequence of form
(ω1 (εn εn )∞ , ω2 (εn εn )∞ )
or
(ω1 (εn εn )∞ , ω2 0∞ ) or (ω1 0∞ , ω2 0∞ )
for some 1 ≤ n < m. As mentioned in the preceding remark we exclude
the situation n = 0. Then from Lemma 3.4 we infer that (ti ) ends with
((εn εn )∞ , (εn εn )∞ ),
or
((εn εn )∞ , 0∞ ) or (0∞ , 0∞ )
for some 1 ≤ n < m. Therefore applying Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 we
conclude that

if (ti ) ends with ((εn εn )∞ , (εn εn )∞ ),
if (ti ) ends with ((εn εn )∞ , 0∞ ),
if (ti ) ends with (0∞ , 0∞ ).

(ii) Thanks to Lemma 3.5 and (i), it suffices to prove the case (ti,1 )
ends with 0∞ and (ti,2 ) ends with the sequence of the form
(3.5)

(ε0 ε0 )j0 (ε0 ε1 )l0 (ε1 ε1 )j1 (ε1 ε2 )l1 · · ·

where
lm ∈ {0, 1} and 0 ≤ jm < ∞ for all m ≥ 0.
We claim that the density of 0 in the sequence of the form (3.5) is 1/3.
We arbitrarily take a sequence (ti,2 ) of the form (3.5). Given a positive
integer n arbitrarily, by the structure of εn (see (P1)) one can get there
exists k = k(n) such that
σ k (ti,2 ) = Bi1 Bi2 Bi3 · · ·

where iℓ ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} and Biℓ is given by (3.3).
On the other hand, an application of (P2) and Lemma 2.2 yields

Since n can be taken arbitrarily, from which the claim follows. So for
log 3
this case we have dimH (E ∩ (E + t)) = 3 log
by Lemma 2.1.
qKL
(iii) Let q ∈ (qKL , 3). Let n be as in Lemma 3.6, given two words
u1 = (bn an bn an , bn an bn an ) and u2 = (an an , an an ), then d(u1) < d(u2 )
can be verified directly. Furthermore for any d ∈ [d(u1), d(u2 )], there
exists a sequence (ci ) such that (ηi ) = uc11 uc22 · · · satisfies d((ηi )) = d.

Hence Dq contains [ log
d(u1 ), log
d(u2 )] by Lemma 2.1.
