Abstract: We study dynamics of two-dimensional N = (0, 1) supersymmetric gauge
theories. In particular, we propose that there is an infrared triality between certain triples
of theories with orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. The proposal is supported by
matching of anomalies and elliptic genera. This triality can be viewed as a (0, 1) counterpart
of the (0, 2) triality proposed earlier by two of the authors and A. Gadde. We also describe
the relation between global anomalies in gauge theoretic and sigma-model descriptions,
filling in a gap in the present literature.

Introduction

A direct analysis of interacting quantum field theories in the strongly coupled quantum
regime is often quite difficult due to absence of a good universal approach to calculating
the path integral beyond its perturbative expansion. Alternatively, one can construct quantities protected under continuous deformations, including renormalization group flow, and
use them to constrain the dynamics of the theory in the infrared. An important class of
such protected quantities is given by ’t Hooft anomalies of global symmetries. Supersymmetry allows construction of additional protected observables that can provide a refined
information about the infrared dynamics. This approach has proved to be very fruitful in
different dimensions and for various amount of supersymmetry. In two dimensions, most

–1–

of the known results so far rely on the existence of at least N = (0, 2) supersymmetry (one
of the seminal papers is [1]). Interesting results on N = (0, 1) non-linear sigma models
(NLSMs) were obtained recently in [2, 3].
In this paper we provide exact results on N = (0, 1) (non-abealian) gauged linear
sigma models (GLSMs). In particular we discrover trialities between certain N = (0, 1)
GLSMs which are very similar in nature to N = (0, 2) trialities studied in [4, 5]. In a
certain sense the N = (0, 1) theories participating in the trialities can be understood as
“real slices” of their “complex” N = (0, 2) counterparts, both on the level of gauge theory
description and effective non-linear sigma model. In particular, the target spaces of NLSMs
are real and complex Grassmannians respectively. It would be interesting to formulate such
a (0, 2)/(0, 1) correspondence more generally.
It is worth noting that many methods that have been successfully used to analyze
N = (0, 2) GLSMs, such as localization [6, 7] and c-extremization [8], are not available in
the N = (0, 1) setting. Nevertheless, N = (0, 1) theories have well-defined elliptic genus
[9] that, as we demonstrate in this paper, can still be computed for at least certain GLSMs
using their effective NLSM description and the Atiyah–Bott localization formula.
2d (0, 1) theories have a surprising connection with stable homotopy theory, and are
believed to represent cocycles in a generalized cohomology theory known as TMF (see [10]
for a comprehensive review of this subject). This relation was first proposed by Stolz and
Teichner [11, 12], based on earlier work of Segal [13], and implies that there is a completely
new set of invariants of 2d (0, 1) theories that take values in the ring of “Topological
Modular Forms.” This new set of invariants refine the elliptic genus, and are expected to
be complete. In other words, they uniquely characterize deformation classes of 2d (0, 1)
theories. These new invariants was recently studied from the physics point of view in
[2, 3, 14], and in [15] for their connection with the topology of 4-manifolds.
It is expected from physics that, once we consider 2d (0, 1) theories with a flavor symmetry G, there is a even finer set of invariants — “G-equivariant Topological Modular
Forms” — that refines the flavored elliptic genus and uniquely characterize classes of theories under deformations preserving both supersymmetry and the flavor symmetry G. Some
preliminary discussions about their properties can be found in [15, Sec. 3.2], but at this
stage, a mathematical theory for them is still lacking. The present work provides one more
motivation for developing the equivariant theory of TMF. Indeed, the unflavored elliptic
genera of almost all theories considered in Section 3 of this paper are identically zero, while
the flavored versions contain rich information about the theories. One also expects similar phenomenon to happen for their refined counterparts — the G-equivariant Topological
Modular Forms would become trivial in the “unflavored limit.”
Another motivation to compare dualities with different amounts of supersymmetry is
that, sometimes, such relations can be very illuminating, or even lead to new dualities. For
example, recently, this approach was successfully used in three-dimensions [16, 17] where,
starting with a well established mirror symmetry of 3d N = 4 gauge theories [18], one
can consider a gradual cascade of soft supersymmetry breaking to derive N = 2 dualities
[19], or even N = 0, non-supersymmetric particle-vortex dualities [20–22]. It would be
interesting to explore whether the first examples of dualities in non-abelian 2d (0, 1) gauge

–2–

theories proposed here, either in compact or in non-compact models, can be related in a
similar way to 2d (0, 2) dualities or, possibly, (0, 4) dualities.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief overview of
N = (0, 1) supersymmetry in 2d and give general comments on the correspondence between (both global and perturbative) anomalies and topological terms in GLSM and NLSM
descriptions. In Section 3, we consider in detail a family of N = (0, 1) GLSMs with SO(n)
gauge groups and provide evidence for trialities between theories from this family. In Section 4, we consider various generalizations. In Appendix A, we provide useful facts and
formulas on cohomology of real Grassmannians.

2.1

N = (0, 1) supersymmetry in 2d
N = (0, 1) superspace and supermultiplets

The N = (0, 1) super-Poincaré symmetry contains a single real supercharge Q+ of positive
chirality which squares to the difference between the Hamiltonian H and the momentum
P (i.e. time and spatial translations):
Q2+ = H − P

(2.1)

Unlike the better studied case of (0, 2) or (2, 2) supersymmetry, there is no (continuous) Rsymmetry. In a sense, there is only Z2 R-symmetry which can be identified with fermionic
parity acting on the right-moving sector.
The (0, 1) superspace has local coordinates (x+ , x− , θ+ ), where x± are the standard
light-cone coordinates and θ+ is a single (self-conjugate) Grassmann coordinate. As usual,
it is customary to introduce the corresponding derivatives ∂± := ∂/∂x± , D+ := ∂/∂θ+ +
iθ+ ∂+ .
For the theories without gravity, there are three basic supermultiplet of (0, 1) superPoincaré symmetry: scalar, Fermi and vector [23–25].
• Fermi multiplet
Γ(x, θ) = ψ− (x) + θ+ F (x)

(2.2)

where ψ− is a left-moving Majorana–Weyl spinor field and F is an auxiallary scalar
field.
• Scalar multiplet
Φ(x, θ) = φ(x) + θ+ ψ+ (x)

(2.3)

where ψ+ is a right-moving Majorana–Weyl spinor field and φ is a scalar field.
• Vector multiplet (after gauge fixing fermionic components)
Λ+ (x, θ) = θ+ A+ (x)
Λ− (x, θ) = A− (x) + θ+ λ− (x)

(2.4)

–3–

where λ− is a left-moving Majorana–Weyl spinor field in the adjoint representation
of the gauge group and A± are the light-cone coordinates of a gauge field, which is
locally an adjoint valued one-form. It is also useful to introduce the corresponding
covariant derivatives
∇+ = D+ + iΛ+
∇− = ∂− + iΛ−

(2.5)

and the super field strength
Σ := i[∇+ , ∇− ] = λ− + θ+ F+−

(2.6)

which has the structure of a Fermi multiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group, with the ordinary field strength F+− playing the role of the auxiliary scalar
field.
2.2

Two-dimensional N = (0, 1) SQCD

In this paper we are primarily interested in dynamics and dualities of 2d gauge theories
with non-abelian gauge group and minimal supersymmetry. Naturally, a theory of this type
could be called either a supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) in two dimensions or a gauged linear
sigma-models (GLSM).1 Specifically, our 2d (0, 1) SQCD or GLSM models are labeled by
the following data:
• Number of scalar and Fermi multiplets, nb ∈ Z≥0 and nf ∈ Z≥0 , respectively. Equivalently, the scalar and Fermi multiplets are chosen to be valued in real vector spaces
Rnb and Rnf equipped with standard bilinear pairing.2
• A compact (not necessarily connected) gauge Lie group G together with homomorphisms ρb : G → O(nb ) and ρf : G → O(nf ). Equivalently, there is a choice of representations of G preserving the bilinear pairings on the vector spaces where scalar
and Fermi multiplets take their values.
• A G-equivariant map J : Rnb → Rnf , known as the (0, 1) superpotential.
In terms of this data, the action then reads

of mass. With this convention all the coefficients in the parameters in the functions J a (Φ)
are dimensionless, since Φi are dimensionless.
Integrating the first three terms over θ+ produces the standard kinetic terms for the
component fields as well as their coupling to the gauge field A± . The last term, after
integrating out the auxiliary fields F a in the path integral produces the supersymmetric
combination of Yukawa couplings and a scalar potential:

and can be written as
Stop = α([(Σ, fG )])

(2.10)

where Σ is the world-sheet, understood as a spin 2-manifold, and fG : Σ → BG is the map
(considered up to homotopy) which determines the isomorphism class of the gauge bundle.
Together, the pair (Σ, fG ), by definition represents an element of the spin bordism group
ΩSpin
(BG). The addition of the topological term can be understood as a coupling of the
2
gauge theory to a fermionic SPT with G symmetry.
At the quantum level, due to the presence of chiral fermions, the theory in general
can suffer from gauge anomalies. This gives a restriction on the allowed representations ρb
and ρf . When the Lie algebra g is simple, the cancellation condition on the perturbative
anomalies, as usual, can be given in terms of the Dynkin indices of the representations ρb
and ρf , understood as the representations of g:
T (ρb ) − T (ρf ) − T (g) = 0 .

(2.11)

As a reminder, the Dynkin index T (ρ) of an irreducible representation ρ is related to its
quadratic Casimir C2 (ρ) as
T (ρ) = C2 (ρ)

dim(ρ)
.
dim(g)

(2.12)

The cancellation condition of the global anomalies (for which the global structure of G
becomes relevant) is more subtle and will not be addressed here in full generality. Briefly,
it is required that a certain element (determined again by the representations ρb,f ) in the

finite abelian group Hom Tor ΩSpin
(BG), U (1) vanishes. Instead, we will check that this
3
condition holds for the particular theories that will be considered in this paper.
The theory also has the gravitational anomaly

Sigma-models

At the classical level, the (0, 1) non-linear sigma-model (NLSM) is specified by the following
data:
• A Riemannian manifold (X, g) called the target space.
• A smooth vector bundle π : E → X equipped with an inner product h(p) : Ep ⊗Ep →
R on the fibers Ep = π −1 (p), p ∈ X, and a connection, locally specified by the
connection 1-form A on X. Informally, E can be called a bundle of left-moving
fermions.
R
• A closed 3-form H ∈ Ω3 (X), dH = 0, such that Ξ H ∈ Z for any closed 3-cycle Ξ
in X. The 3-form H is also known as NS-NS flux and locally is given by H = dB
where B is the Kalb–Ramond 2-form field.3
In terms of this data, the action of the sigma-model with a world-sheet Σ takes the
following form [24] (in order to make the expression lighter, we assume in the formula below
that Σ itself is flat; if needed, the coupling to the metric on Σ can be easily restored)

where Φi are components of the map φ : Σ → X promoted to scalar superfields and Γa
are components of a Fermi superfield valued in the fiber Eφ(x) . The last two terms are the
supersymmetrization of the Wess–Zumino–Witten term. The bosonic part is written in
terms of a 3-manifold Ξ such that ∂Ξ = Σ and the map φ is extended to a map Ξ → X.4
As in the GLSM, at the quantum level the theory generically suffers from the anomalies.
In particular, integrating out chiral fermions in general does not produce a well-defined
function on the space of maps Σ → X. The first condition for the anomaly cancellation
is that w1 (T X) = w1 (E), i.e. that T X ⊕ E is orientable. This condition can be already
seen at the level of reduction to a supersymmetric matrix model, where the path integral
becomes just the ordinary integral over X of the Grassmann integral over the fiber of E.
This will have a globally well-defined sign if w1 (T X) = w1 (E). The second condition is the
requirement that there is a globally defined bundle ST X ⊗ SE, where SV denotes a spinor
bundle of the real vector bundle V equipped with an inner product. The obstruction to
the existence of such bundle globally is given by w2 (T X) = w2 (E) ∈ H 2 (X, Z2 ). Note that
3

To be precise, B is a connection on a gerbe on X and H should be considered as an element of differential
cohomology of X with integral coefficients in degree 3, the natural home for the curvature of a connection
on a gerbe on X.
4
In general such extension can be obstructed. The proper way to define the WZW term in general is as
the holonomy of the gerbe connection (locally given by the Kalb-Ramond 2-form field B) along Σ.

–6–

the individual spinor bundles ST X and SE may not exist. The global choice of ST X ⊗ SE
is in general not unique (when E is trivial this choice is equivalent to the choice of spin
structure on X) and the quantum theory depends on it. This anomaly can be already
seen at the level of N = 1 supersymmetric quantum mechanics obtained by dimensional
reduction from 2d to 1d. In particular, the Hilbert space of such quantum mechanics is
the space of (square-integrable) sections of ST X ⊗ SE and the supercharge is the Dirac
operator, which can be well defined only when w2 (T X) = w2 (E). The third condition on
the topology of X and E is
1
(p1 (X) − p1 (E)) = 0 ∈ H 4 (X, Z)
2

(2.15)

and cannot be seen just at the level of quantum mechanics. Roughly, it comes from the
condition that there is a well-defined Dirac operator on the loop space of X. Note that
the 1/2 operation on the left-hand side in the formula above is well defined due to the
first condition w2 (T X) − w2 (E) = 0 and the fact that p1 = w22 mod 2. The corresponding
anomaly can be also understood as the anomaly with respect to diffeomorphisms of the
target space X and gauge transformations of the connections on the bundle E. As usual,
this anomaly can be seen at one loop. The invariance under diffeomorphisms and gauge
transformations can be cured by modifying the gauge transformation property of the Kalb–
Ramond field B [24, 31, 32]. This, however, modifies the usual Bianchi identity (dH = 0)
for the corresponding field strength

where FT X is the curvature of a certain connection on T X (obtained by shifting the LeviCivita connection by H) and FE is the curvature of the 1-form connection A on E. By
passing to the de Rham cohomology, one gets (2.15) but in H 4 (X, C). When E is trivial,
the choice of the 3-form H trivializing the difference of the Chern–Weil realizations of the
Pontryagin classes in (2.16) is called a geometric string structure of X (the full data of the
geometric string structure is more involved, see e.g. [33] for details). The geometric string
structure is a refinement of a topological string structure, that is a choice of a homotopy

as a shift of H by a curvature of gerbe, modulo an exact form.
2.4

Flowing from gauge theory to sigma-model

Let us assume that the system of equations J a (φ) = 0 given by the superpotential of a
GLSM is non-degenerate and the action of the gauge group on the corresponding space of

–7–

solutions Y := {J a (φ) = 0} is free. On the classical level, the parameters in the functions
J a (φ) are marginal while g, m → ∞ under RG flow. In the limit m → ∞ the values of the
scalar fields φi are restricted to Y := {J a (φ) = 0}. Moreover, in the limit g → ∞ only
gauge invariant combinations of the fields survive. Therefore, under some approximation5 ,
before reaching the IR fixed point the GLSM flows to the sigma-model with target space
X = Y /G

(2.18)

and the bundle of left-moving fermions
E = Ker

∂J
∂φ

(2.19)

nf → Rnb . As was mentioned in Section 2.3, to define
where ∂J
∂φ is understood as a map Y ×R
the theory at the quantum level it is also necessary to specify the choice of trivialization of
w2 (T M ) − w2 (E) and (p1 (E) − p1 (T X))/2. Such trivializations are fixed by the way the
manifold X and the bundle E are realized via the equations Ja = 0 and also a choice of
the topological term (2.10). Let us briefly mention the general situation and later give a
more concrete correspondence for the family of gauge theories of interest.
For the sake of technical simplicity of the argument, assume that E itself is trivial.
Then, such trivializations are the spin and string structure on X. The case of the nontrivial bundle is similar. The spin and string structure on Y = {J a (φ) = 0} are induced
from the standard spin and string structure on Rnb using the trivialization of the normal
bundle given by the vectors ∂J a /∂φi . Given that the G-action is non-anomalous, the spin
and string structures on Y induce those on X = Y /G. The sets of spin and string structures
on X = Y /G are torsors over H 1 (X, Z2 ) and H 3 (X, Z) respectively. (The same is true for
the trivializations in the case of non-trivial bundle E.) The cohomology of the quotient
with coefficients in R can be calculated using Cartan–Leray spectral sequence

H p (BG, H q (Y, R)) ⇒ H p+q (Y /G, R).

(2.20)

In particular, there are universal (i.e. independent of Y itself) contributions H 1 (BG, Z2 )
and H 3 (BG, Z) to the cohomologies classifying, respectively, spin and string structures on
X = Y /G. On the other hand, there is an Atiyah–Hirzerbruch spectral sequence

Meaning the UV scale Λ  m, g. But what is important, is that independently of this condition, the
GLSM and NLSM can be continuously connected in the space of N = (0, 1) quantum field theories and
therefore the quantities protected under continuous deformations remain the same.

This description of the classification of 2d fermionic SPTs is essentially equivalent to the
one in [27–30].
Moreover, there is a coboundary map H 2 (BG, 2πR/Z) → H 3 (BG, Z) induced by the
short exact sequence Z → R → 2πR/Z of the coefficients. Altogether,
this gives arelation

between the choice of the generalized theta-angle α ∈ Hom Ω2 (pt), 2πR/Z and a
choice of both a spin and a string structure on sigma-model target X. At the intuitive level,
the need of choice of spin and string structure on the target arises from the ambiguity of
the definition of the Pfaffian arising after integrating fermions on the space of maps from
the world-sheet to the target X = Y /G, whose topology is in part captured by BG. The
different topological terms in the gauge theory thus change the dependence of the Pfaffian
on the homotopy type of such map.

qΣ (a + b) = qΣ (a) + qΣ (b) + a ∪ b.

where αi ∈ Z2 , x is the generator of H 1 (BZ2 , Z2 ), and Arf(Σ) is the Arf invariant of the
spin surface Σ (equivalently, Arf invariant of the quadratic form qΣ ). This theory does

(2.33)

Using again the explicit expression (2.32), we arrive at the condition N ≡ 0 (mod 8). This
is exactly the condition to have an anomaly-free Z2 gauge symmetry in the gauge theory
description!
Since H 3 (RPN −1 , Z) = 0 and H 1 (RPN −1 , Z2 ) = Z2 there is a unique string structure
and two different spin structures, which is in agreement with the classification (2.24) of
topological terms for the Z2 gauge field. Namely, different spin structures on RPN −1
correspond to different values of α1 in the topological part of the GLSM action (2.27).
The second term in (2.27) is transferred directly to the sigma-model description. Note
that in the GLSM, the sum over gauge bundles, that is the homotopy classes of the map

fG : Σ → BZ2 , can be interpreted as the sum of the homotopy classes of the maps
φ : Σ → X = RPN −1 in the sigma-model description. One way to see this is to realize
BZ2 = RP∞ and the sigma-model target as its subspace X = RPN −1 . Then, taking
into account that N is sufficiently large, we can deform fG so that its image lies inside
RPN −1 ⊂ RP∞ . That is, fG and φ are related by the condition that the diagram

Elliptic genus

The elliptic genus (in the Ramond–Ramond sector) of a (0, 1) supersymmetric quantum
field theory (not necessarily superconformal) can be defined as the index of the supercharge
operator Q+ acting on the Hilbert space H of the theory on a circle, refined by the U (1)
rotation symmetry of the circle [9],
I(q) := Tr H|Q+ =0 (−1)F q P .

(2.35)

Here the momentum operator P generate the U (1) isometry of the circle and F is the
fermion parity. Note that instead of the total fermion parity F in principle one can use
only the right-moving fermion parity FR . However, the latter in general can be explicitly
broken, especially away from the superconformal point (e.g. by the mass terms or Yukawa
couplings). The same argument as for the Witten index in quantum mechanics shows that
such refined index should be invariant under continuous deformations of the theory, and
also equal to the partition function of the theory on T 2 with complex structure τ (which
is related to q via q := e2πiτ ) and odd spin structure (i.e. with periodic-periodic boundary
conditions on the fermions). At the conformal point, it is also given by
I(q) = Tr H (−1)F q L0 −cL /24 q L0 −cR /24 ,

(2.36)

where L0 and L0 are the standard generators of the Virasoro algebra and L0 − L0 = P .
For the sigma-model, the elliptic genus can be computed as an integral of a certain
characteristic class. Assume the target X is even-dimensional and the bundle of left-moving
fermions E is of even rank. Then,

Note that in principle the expression (2.37) can be evaluated for any real manifold
X with a real vector bundle E. In general, however, Φ(q) ∈ Q[[q]] may not have integer
coefficients, and Φ(q) ∈ Z[[q]] only when the anomaly cancellation condition w2 (T X) −
w2 (E) = 0 is satisfied. Moreover, if the second condition, (p1 (T X) − p1 (E))/2 = 0, is
satisfied, Φ(q) is a modular form of weight (dim X − rank E)/2. The normalization factor
in (2.40) is chosen to trade the multiplier system for SL(2, Z) modular transformations —
E
that arises due to the gravitational anomaly cR − cL = dim X−rank
— for a non-trivial
2
modular weight. At the same time, the value of I(q) does not depend on a choice of the
spin or string sctructure.
When a theory has flavor symmetry H, i.e. a symmetry that commutes with the
supercharge and the fermion number operator, it is possible to refine the elliptic genus by
inserting the image of an element h ∈ H of the flavor group under the representation map
ρH : H → End(H):
I(h; q) := Tr H|Q+ =0 (−1)F q P ρH (h).

(2.42)

Such refined elliptic genus is often referred to as equivariant or flavored elliptic genus. Of
course, the function I(h; q) only depends on the conjugacy class of h. The coefficients of
the expansion of the elliptic genus in q can be understood as the elements of the (real)

Jacobi-like modular form (the classical Jacobi forms correspond to the case H = U (1))
with the index determined by the ’t Hooft anomaly of H.
In case H is a connected simple Lie group, h can be assumed to be an element of a
maximal torus of TH ⊂ H. Suppose the theory has a non-linear sigma-model description
with H realized as an isometry of the target space X, which lifts to an isometry of E
that commutes with the projection map E → X (i.e. E is an H-equivariant vector bundle
over X). Then, I(q; h) can still be computed using the formula (2.37), but equivariantly
with respect to TH . To do that, one can use the generalized Atiyah–Bott localization
theorem. Namely, let h` be coordinates of h on the maximal torus TH ∼

It is worth noting that the non-equivariant elliptic genus is identically zero when
rank E > dim X. This is consistent with the fact that such sigma model can be continuously deformed (preserving N = (0, 1) supersymmetry) to a theory that spontaneously
breaks supersymmetry. Such a deformation can be done by turning on a superpotential
corresponding to a generic smooth section of the E. There will be no zero of this section
and thus supersymmetry will be spontaneously broken on the semiclassical level. This
indicates that the refinement of the elliptic genus valued in the coefficient ring of TMF
should also vanish identically for such models. This is however in general not true for the
equivariant elliptic genus and, therefore, also its refinement valued in the coefficient ring
of equivariant TMF. This is consistent with the fact that the latter is an invariant only
under deformations preserving the corresponding flavor symmetries. In particular, one is
only allowed to turn on a superpotential which is an H-equivariant section of E.

A family of 2d (0, 1) gauge theories

UV Lagrangian description and gauge anomaly cancellation

Consider a family of 2d (0, 1) gauge theories with SO(n3 ) gauge group and SO(N1 ) ×
SO(N2 ) × SO(N3 ) flavor symmetry, with the scalar and Fermi multiplets in the representations specified in the Table 1. This matter content can also be summarized in a quiver

with αi ∈ Z2 . In order for the theory to be well defined, one needs to show that the
SO(n3 ) symmetry is not anomalous. At the perturbative level, as explained in Section
2.2, the anomaly cancellation condition is given in terms of indices of the representation.
For convenience we present a table of indices and dimensions of relevant representations of
SO(n) in Table 2.

Note that the symmetric representation is reducible. It decomposes into traceless
symmetric and a singlet. The singlet, of course, does not contribute to the anomaly.
Therefore, we have the following condition on the anomaly cancellation in this class of 2d
(0, 1) gauge theories:
N1 + N2 − N3 − (n3 + 2) − (n3 − 2) = 0

⇔

n3 =

N1 + N2 − N3

In principle, one also has to make sure that there is no global
 gauge anomaly. Inthis
(BSO(n)), U (1) , is
particular case, the group classifying global anomalies, Hom ΩSpin
3
trivial. This, however, is no longer the case when the gauge group is replaced by O(n),
as will be discussed in Sections 4.1. Similarly, there is also no possible mixed anomaly
(pertubative or global) between SO(Ni ) flavor symmetries and the gauge symmetry. We
will also confirm the canceallation of the anomalies in the sigma-model description.
At the classical level, the theory actually has larger flavor symmetries, O(Ni ), under
which the superfields P, Φ, Γ, and Ψ transform in vector representations. However, at the
quantum level they generically have global mixed anomalies with the SO(n3 ) gauge group
corresponding to the 3d SPTs with action w2 (SO(n3 ))w1 (O(Ni )).

3.2

Triality: Anomaly matching

In the previous section we described a family of (0, 1) gauge theories labeled by ordered
triples (N1 , N2 , N3 ) ∈ Z3+ and further parametrized by (A, B, C) ∈ R3 . The gauge anomaly
cancellation condition unambiguously determines the rank of the gauge group SO(n3 ) with
n3 = N1 +N22 −N3 . This gives a restriction on the triples,
N1 + N2 − N3 ∈ 2Z+ .

(3.5)

We conjecture that the theories labeled by permuted triples (N1 , N2 , N3 ) (assuming
they all satisfy the condition above), when the parameters (A, B, C) are in a certain cone
9

In the literature, sometime the phrase “global anomaly” is used to refer to the anomaly of a global
symmetry. However, in this paper, the term “global anomaly” is reserved for the anomaly with respect to
large gauge transformations.

in R3 , all flow to the same infrared fixed point, which is a non-trivial (0, 1) SCFT. The
dual theories have gauge groups SO(ni ) where
ni =

N1 + N2 + N3
− Ni ,
2

i = 1, 2, 3.

(3.6)

The proposed triality is analogous to a triality of 2d SQCD models with larger N = (0, 2)
supersymmetry [4].
The first simple check of the conjecture is the matching of ’t Hooft anomalies of the
theories that are supposed to be dual. The gravitational anomaly of a theory labeled by the
triple (N1 , N2 , N3 ) is given by the difference between the numbers of left and right-moving
fermions:

Sigma-model description

For the gauge theory in the family considered above, the superpotential term involving
Fermi multiplets Γ gives the following equations on the bosonic components φ, p of the
scalar superfields Φ, P ,
φαi pα` = 0,

∀ i, `.

(3.9)

This system can be interpreted as the condition that the components φαi and pα` form two
orthogonal collections of N1 and N2 vectors in Rn3 respectively.
The superpotential terms that involve the Fermi multiplet Σ transforming in the symmetric representation of the gauge group SO(n3 ) gives the following equations, analogous
to D-terms of higher-SUSY models:

The topology of the space of solutions of the combined system of equations depends drastically on the relative signs of A, B, and C. There are 4 essential cases (assuming neither
of the constants vanishes):

– 16 –

1. C/A < 0, C/B < 0. In this case the space of solutions is obviously empty, i.e. X = ∅.
The (0, 1) supersymmetry is expected to be broken dynamically.
2. C/A > 0, C/B < 0. First, one can argue that necessarily pα` = 0, ∀ α, `. Suppose
that this is not true and some of the vectors p~` 6= 0 ∈ Rn3 . By using the SO(n3 )
gauge symmetry one can always rotate it so that it is aligned with the first basis
vector, i.e. p1` 6= 0 while pα` = 0, α 6= 1. The equation (3.9) then implies that φ1i = 0
for all i, and the first equation of (3.10) simplifies to
B(~
p` )2 = C,

(3.11)

which has no solutions due to C/B < 0. Having shown that one necessarily has
pα` = 0, ∀α, `, the system of equations (3.10) then simplifies to

Following (2.19), the bundle of left-moving fermions is given by
E = S N3 ⊕ QN2

(3.14)

where S is the rank-n3 tautological bundle (i.e. the bundle of the n3 -planes in the
definition of the Grassmannian) and S is the rank-(N1 − n3 ) orthogonal bundle,
i.e. the bundle of the (N1 − n3 )-planes orthogonal to the n3 -planes in the definition of
the Grassmannian. The bundles S N3 and QN2 arise as the massless modes of Γ and
Ψ Fermi multiplets respectively. As explicitly shown in Appendix A, the anomaly
cancellation conditions are indeed also satisfied in the sigma-model description.

The phase structure of the theory is summarized in Figure 2. The UV limit corresponds
to the targets being of large size, that is C → ∞ (relative to A and B). The exchange of
the role of the n3 -dimensional subspace in RN1 and the orthogonal (N1 − n3 )-dimensional
f 3 , N1 ) and Gr(N

subspace provides a canonical isomorphism between Gr(n
=
f
Gr(n2 , N1 ), which exchanges the tautological and orthogonal bundles S and Q. It follows
that the targets and the bundles of left-moving fermions that appear in the lower right and
upper left corners of the phase diagram for the theories that differ by the permutation of
the triples (N1 , N2 , N3 ) are pairwise isomorphic, as illustrated in Figure 3. It is however,
not obvious if, for a GLSM with a given triple (N1 , N2 , N3 ), the theories in the lower left
and upper right part of the phase diagram can be continuously deformed into each other.
At the classical level, both regions touch the point where C = 0, where the corresponding
sigma-model targets become infinitesimally small and, therefore, quantum effects become
strong. We conjecture that the theories from the two regions can be continuously deformed
into each other at the quantum level (preserving (0, 1) supersymmetry). We will support
this claim by matching equivariant elliptic genera in the next section.
10

For this reason, for self-consistency, one should define gauging SO(0) group as taking two disjoint copies
of the theory. At the same time, gauging O(0) is a trivial operation.

f 3 , N2 ) and the bundle E = S N3 ⊕ QN1 .
as a (0, 1) sigma-model with target X = Gr(n
First, one needs to check that w1 (T X) = w1 (E) and w2 (T X) = w2 (E). The mod-2
cohomology of the real Grassmannian and the explicit expressions for the Stiefel–Whitney
classes of the tangent bundles is described in detail in Appendix A. Using the fact that
w(E) = (w(S))N3 (w(Q))N1 , where w denotes the total Stiefel–Whitney class, and the
explicit formulas in the Appendix it is straightforward to check that those conditions are
indeed satisfied. Checking (p1 (T X) − p1 (E))/2 = 0 in the integral cohomology is a little
more subtle. However, due to the fact that the torsion in the cohomology has only order-2
non-trivial elements, it is enough to check that p1 (T X) = p1 (E) for rational Pontryagin
classes and also that
1
(p1 (T X) − p1 (E)) ≡ 0

(mod 2)

⇔

w4 (T X) = w4 (E) .

p1 (T X) in Appendix A.

tion is reflected as follows in the GLSM description. First, as follows from Appendix
A, H 1 (X, Z2 ) = 0, so that there is a unique generalized spin structure. We also have
H 3 (X, Z) = Z2 , so there are just two different string structures. They correspond to different values of α1 in the topological part of the gauge theory action (3.3). The second term
in (3.3) is transferred directly to the sigma-model description.
3.4

Triality: Elliptic genus

For a gauge theory with (0, 2) supersymmetry, there is a general formula for the equivariant
elliptic genus that can be obtained by localization [6, 7]. In the (0, 2) setting, the gauging
has geometric interpretation of taking a Kähler quotient (unlike the ordinary quotient in
the (0, 1) setting) and the formula can be interpreted as the Jeffrey–Kirwan localization
theorem [38, 39] which relates integrals of characteristic classes on the quotient to the
integrals of equivariant characteristic classes on the original space. The latter can be
evaluated using Atiyah–Bott equivarint fixed-point localization theorem [36, 37].
For 2d (0, 1) theories, there is no available localization procedure, either from the path
integral or from the geometric quotient point of view. However, given the non-linear sigma-

– 20 –

model description of the theory, if the target space and the bundle have a non-trivial action
of the flavor symmetry group, one can in principle still calculate the equivariant version of
the integral (2.37) using the Atiyah–Bott localization theorem as was already mentioned
in Section 2.6.
Consider a GLSM from our family in the domain of superpotential couplings where it
has NLSM description specified by the bundle
S N3 ⊕ QN2
.

(3.21)

f 3 , N1 )
Gr(n
There is an SO(N1 ) × SO(N2 ) × SO(N3 ) flavor-symmetry group acting on the bundle
equivariantly (i.e. the action commutes with the projection map). Note that only SO(N1 )
acts non-trivially on the base, while the groups SO(N2 ) and SO(N3 ) rotate the fibers at
fixed points on the base. It is clear that the expression (2.44) vanishes unless N1 , N2 , N3
and n3 are all even (in particular dimensions of the fiber and the base should be both even),
so we will assume that this is the case in the rest of this section. First, one needs to classify
fixed points of the action of a maximal torus TSO(N1 ) of SO(N1 ). For the details we refer
QN1 /2
to [40]. Let us choose the maximal torus to be the subgroup i=1
SO(2)(i) ⊂ SO(N1 )
2
N
1
where SO(2)(i) rotates R(i) ⊂ R the 2-dimensional plane spanned by the (2i − 1)-th
f 3 , N1 ) will
and (2i)-th basis vectors in RN1 . The fixed points of the Grassmannian Gr(n
be configurations of n3 -planes inside RN1 invariant under all such rotations. This happens
when the n3 -plane, up to orientation, coincides with ⊕i∈S R2(i) where S ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , N1 /2}
with length being |S| = n3 /2. Taking into account two possible orientations we conclude
that the fixed points are labeled by pairs: the subsets with length n3 /2 of the set of N1 /2
elements and an additional ± label,
X ⊃ F = {x(S,β) }S∈{1,2,...,N1 /2},|S|=n3 /2;β=± .

(3.22)

From this description of the set of fixed points, it is easy to see how the maximal
torus of SO(N1 ) acts on the tautological and orthogonal bundles. Denote the equivariant
∗
parameters for SO(2)(i) subgroups defined above by λi , i.e. HSO(2)
(pt) ∼
= C[λi ]. Then,
(i)
the equivariant Chern roots of the tautological bundle S at a point xS,β are {±λi }i∈S .
The collection of the Chern roots is the same for both orientations of the n3 -plane β = ±,
since the change of the orientation corresponds to changing the sign of one of the roots. In
particular, the equivariant Pontryagin classes, which are basic symmetric polynomials in
Q
λ2i are the same for β = ±. However, the equivariant Euler class of S at xS,± is ± i∈S λi .
Similarly, for the orthogonal bundle Q, the equivariant Chern roots at x(S,β) are
{±λi }i∈S where S = {1, 2, . . . , N1 /2}\S is the complement of S with length |S| = N1 −n3 .
Q
And the equivariant Euler class is ± i∈S λi for β = ±. Note that the deck transformation
f 3 , N1 ) → Gr(n3 , N1 ) of the Grassmannian of unoriented planes will
of the 2-fold cover Gr(n
swap the two points xS,± . Such deck transformation flips the sign of one of the λi , i ∈ S

– 21 –

and also one of λj , j ∈ S. This corresponds to the action of an element of the Weyl group
of SO(N1 ) which is not in the Weyl group of SO(n3 ) × SO(N1 − n3 ).
Now the Chern roots of T X can be determined from the canonical isomorphism
TX ∼
= S ⊗ Q. So, its equivariant Chern roots are {±λi ± λj }i∈S,j∈S . The Euler class
Q
is i∈S,j∈S (λ2j − λ2i ) for both β = ±. While the Euler class of S and Q both flip sign upon
going from xS,+ to xS,− , the Euler class of their tensor product remains the same.
Having understood the action of SO(N1 ) on the base and on the bundles T X, S and Q
it remains to consider the action of SO(N2 ) and SO(N3 ). They act by rotating the fibers of
E = S N3 ⊕QN1 in a canonical way. Denote by µr and νa the equivariant parameters for the
maximal tori in SO(N2 ) and SO(N3 ) respectively, with r = 1 . . . N2 /2 and a = 1 . . . N3 /2.
The equivariant Chern roots of S N3 at the fixed point xS,β are then {±λi ±νa }i∈S,a=1...N3 /2
Q
and the Euler class is i∈S,a=1...N3 /2 (λ2i − νa2 ) for both β = ±. Similarly, the equivariant
Chern roots of QN2 at the fixed point xS,β are {±λi ± µr }i∈S,r=1...N2 /2 and the Euler class
Q
is i∈S,r=1...N2 /2 (λ2i − µ2r ) for both β = ±.
Now we are ready to apply the Atiyah–Bott localization formula (2.43) to the equivariant integral (2.37) and obtain the following explicit expression for the equivariant elliptic
genus,

The factor of 2 is the result of the sum over the index β = ± in the overall sum over the
fixed points x(S,β) ∈ F ⊂ X. Since the summand depends only on λ2i it gives the same
contribution to both choices.
As expected, the expression above for the elliptic genus is explicitly symmetric under
the exchange N3 ↔ N2 , ν ↔ µ, up to a possible sign,
IN1 ,N2 ,N3 (λ, µ, ν; q) = ±IN1 ,N3 ,N2 (λ, ν, µ; q).

This symmetry corresponds to the isomorphism Gr(n
= Gr(N
accompanied by the exchange of S and Q bundles, as indicated by one of the arrows in
Figure 3. A possible extra sign corresponds to a possible flip of the overall orientation.
In this work we want to avoid subtleties related to the choice of overall orientation of the
target and bundles and thus want to consider the theories that differ by the orientation
to be equivalent. At the level of the Hilbert space, this equivalence is realized by shifting
the fermion number of the vacuum by 1. Note that, in particular, in Section 3.3 we considered gauge theories that differ by a change of the signs of the superpotential couplings
(A, B, C) → (−A, −B, −C) to be equivalent, but, to get back to the original action, one

– 22 –

needs to accompany this with Σ → −Σ, which (depending on n3 ) could change the sign of
the path integral.
What is non-trivial is that (3.23) is also invariant (again, up to a possible sign) under
the exchange N1 ↔ N2 , λ ↔ µ,
IN1 ,N2 ,N3 (λ, µ, ν; q) = ±IN2 ,N1 ,N3 (µ, λ, ν; q)

(3.25)

We have verified this property by comparing the first terms of the expansions of I(λ, µ, ν; q)
and I(µ, λ, ν; q) in q for multiple values of N1 , N2 and N3 . This identity strongly supports
the claim made in the previous section, namely that the theories in the lower right and
upper left domains of the phase diagrams shown in Figures 2 and 3 can be continuously
deformed into each other at the quantum level.
Let us note that the elliptic genus vanishes if one sets equivariant parameters λ, µ, ν to
zero. As was discussed in a general setting at the end of Section 2.6, this is in accordance
with the fact that an NLSM with rank E > dim X can be continuously deformed to a theory
with spontaneously broken supersymmetry if one forgets about flavor symmetries. On the
level of GLSM a deformation to a theory with spontaneously broken supersymmetry can
be done by turning on a constant term in the (0,1) superpotential associated to the Fermi
multiplet Γ.

Generalizations
O(n) gauge group

In this section, we briefly comment on how the above analysis can be generalized to the
case when SO(n3 ) gauge groups in the family of theories considered in Section 3 is replaced
by O(n3 ) gauge group. Namely, let us consider the family of theories with the same field
content as in Table 1, also depicted in the quiver diagram of Figure 1. As we will see in a
moment, the matter content will have to be slightly modified to ensure the cancellation of
gauge anomalies.
The perturbative anomaly is the same as in the SO(n3 ) case and remains canceled as
long as
n3 =

N1 + N2 − N3
2

(4.1)

However, unlike the SO(n3 ) gauge theory, in 
principle there can be a global anomaly
corresponding to non-trivial elements of Hom ΩSpin
(BO(n3 )), 2πR/Z . In particular,
3
the theory can have a Z2 global anomaly corresponding to the 3d SPT with the action
π w2 (O(n3 ))w1 (O(n3 )) and a Z8 global anomaly corresponding to the 3d topological term
π
4 ABK[PD(w1 (O(n3 ))], where ABK[PD(a)] denotes the Arf–Brown–Kervaire invariant of
a pin− surface representing the Poincaré dual to the class a in the first mod-2 cohomology
group. The latter anomaly is essentially the same as the anomaly in fermionic 2d theories
with Z2 symmetry, which has already played an important role in the example considered
in Section 2.5. The Z2 symmetry here is any Z2 ⊂ O(n3 ) generated by an element with

– 23 –

determinant −1. The Majorana–Weyl fermions charged with respect to this Z2 contribute
±1 to this mod-8 anomaly depending on the chirality. Counting the total contribution to
this mod-8 anomaly for our family of theories gives
N1 + N2 − N3 − (n3 − 1) − (n3 − 1) ≡ 2

(mod 8)

(4.2)

which is always non-zero. The easiest way to fix this is to add two real left-moving fermions
Ωi , i = 1, 2 transforming in the determinant representation of O(n3 ). Such fermions are
analogs of the (0, 2) Fermi multiplets transforming in the determinant representation of
U (n3 ) gauge group of (0, 2) gauge theories participating in the (0, 2) triality of [4]. There,
they were required to cancel the anomaly for the diagonal U (1) of U (N ).
We would like to argue that once this modification to the theory is made, all other
possible global anomalies are also canceled. However, instead of considering cancellation of
the anomalies in the GLSM setting, we will do so in the non-linear sigma-model description.
The semi-classical analysis of Section 3.3 goes through with the oriented Grassmannian
f
Gr(n,
N ) replaced everywhere with the Grassmannian Gr(n, N ) of unoriented n-planes in
N
R , and two copies of the determinant of the tautological bundle added to the bundles
of left-moving fermions. For example, in the regime A/C > 0, B/C < 0 the non-linear
sigma-model is now described in term of the bundle
E = S N3 ⊕ QN2 ⊕ (det S)2
.

(4.3)

X = Gr(n3 , N1 )
Similar to the oriented case, the non-trivial torsion elements of H ∗ (Gr(n, N )) are all
of order 2. So to ensure the cancellation of global anomalies (assuming the perturbative
anomalies are already canceled) it is enough to require that
w1 (T X) = w1 (E),
w2 (T X) = w2 (E),
w4 (T X) = w4 (E).

(4.4)

Using the explicit formulas in Appendix A, one can check that these conditions are indeed
satisfied. If n3 and N1 are sufficiently large, we have H 1 (X, Z2 ) ∼
= Z2 and H 3 (X, Z) ∼
= Z2 .
Therefore there are two possible spin and string structures. The GLSM description can
have the following topological terms (cf. (2.27) and (3.3)):


Z
Stop = π α1 qΣ (w1 (O(n3 ))) + α2
w2 (O(n3 )) + α3 Arf(Σ) .
(4.5)
Σ

The different values of α1 ∈ Z2 and α2 ∈ Z2 correspond to different choices of the generalized spin and string structures. The last term in (4.5) is directly transferred to the
sigma-model description.
The calculation of the elliptic genus is also completely parallel to the one in Section
3.4 for the SO case. Since now the target X is the Grassmannian of unoriented n3 -planes

– 24 –

in RN1 , there will be half as many fixed points as for the SO(N1 ) action. Namely, the fixed
points now are labeled just by subsets S ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N1 /2} of length |S| = n3 /2. The
orientation label β = ± should be forgotten. Because of the addition of (det S)2 to the
bundle of left-moving fermions E, to get a non-zero result one should calculate the integral
equivariantly with respect to the SO(2) symmetry rotating (det S)2 = det S ⊗ R2 . Let
us denote the corresponding equivariant parameter by ζ. Physically, e2πiζ is the fugacity
of SO(2) flavor symmetry rotating the fermions Ωi that transform in the determinant
representation of O(n3 ) gauge group. The explicit expression for the elliptic genus then
reads

The result differs from (3.23) by an overall factor independent of µ, λ, ν. Therefore, we
still have a symmetry with respect to any permutation of N1 , N2 , N3 accompanied by a
corresponding permutation of µ, λ, ν.
4.2

Sp(2n) gauge group

We conjecture that the analogous triality holds for a family of (0, 1) gauge theories with
Sp(2n) gauge groups11 obtained from the theories considered in Section 3 via the known
negative dimension correspondence
Sp(2n) ←→ SO(−2n)

(4.8)

with representations related according to the exchange
symmetrization ←→ anti-symmetrization.

(4.9)

Namely, we want to consider a family of (0, 1) gauge theories with Sp(n3 ) gauge group
and Sp(N1 ) × Sp(N2 ) × Sp(N3 ) flavor symmetry, where n3 , N1 , N2 , N3 are all even. The
matter content is specified in Table 3.
One can explicitly check that gauge anomaly is canceled, which also automatically
follows from the correspondence (4.8).
The superpotential can be obtained from the one in the SO(n) case by doing the formal
replacements n3 → −n3 , Ni → −Ni . Instead of writing down the superpotential explicitly,
11

One way to define Sp(2n) is as the subgroup of GL(n, H) (linear transformations of n-dimensional
quaternionic vector space) that preserves the quaternion-hermitian form
hx, yi = x1 y 1 + . . . + xn y n

(4.7)

where bar denotes quaternionic conjugate.

it is more convenient to write down the corresponding constraints on the scalar fields, which
contain the same amount of information. For this purpose, it is convenient to represent
the fields φ and p, respectively, as N2 /2 × n3 /2 and N1 /2 × n3 /2 quaternion-valued fields.
Then, the equations produced by the superpotential terms containing Γ read

There are n3 /2 real equations and n3 /2 × (n3 /2 − 1)/2 quaternionic equations. In total,
there are n3 /2 + 4n3 /2 × (n3 /2 − 1)/2 = n3 (n3 − 1)/2 real equations, which is precisely
the number of real component of Σ. The analysis similar to the one done in the Section
3.3 then leads to the same NLSM descriptions, but with real Grassmannians replaced by
quternionic ones. For example, in the regime where A/C > 0 and B/C < 0, the target
space is
X = HGr(n3 /2, N1 /2) ∼

Sp(N1 )
Sp(n3 ) × Sp(N1 − n3 )

(4.12)

where HGr(n3 /2, N1 /2) is the Grassmannian of quaternionic n3 /2-planes in HN1 /2 .
Finally, doing the formal replacements n3 → −n3 and Ni → −Ni in (3.23) tells us that
the expression for the elliptic genus will be the same as in SO case.
4.3

Quiver mutations

As in the case of 2d (0, 2) trialities [4], one can use the basic theories considered in Section
3 to construct quiver theories with gauge groups of the form SO(m1 ) × SO(m2 ) × . . . by
“gluing” the basic theories together. Namely, one can glue two basic theories by identifying
one of the SO(Ni ) flavor symmetries of one theory with the SO(n03 ) gauge symmetry of
the other, and vice versa. The absence of mixed anomaly ensures that this is a well-defined

– 26 –

operation at the quantum level. This process can be continued by gluing the result with
another basic (0, 1) SQCD and so on.
By replacing any of the basic theories in the composed quiver, one gets a dual theory
described by a “mutated” quiver. Such quiver mutations produce a network of infrared
dualities between different quiver theories.
4.4

Non-compact models

So far, we mainly focused our attention on the IR physics of “compact” (0, 1) models, where
all scalar fields are constrained to be in a compact region of the field space. For example,
at the intermediate energy scales, our models flow through non-linear sigma-models with
Grassmannian target manifolds X.
Relaxing this condition leads to another natural generalization of our SQCD-type
models, where some of the scalars classically can take arbitrarily large values. A simple
family of such “non-compact” (0, 1) models is obtained by taking trivial superpotential,
J = 0. Consider, for example, a 2d (0, 1) gauge theory with gauge group G = SU (Nc )
and scalar matter fields that furnish Nf copies of the fundamental representation V =
CNc ∼
= R2Nc . A more general class of models can be obtained by incorporating (0, 1) Fermi
multiplets in various representations of G, but, for simplicity, here we will only consider
SQCD-type theories with scalar matter multiplets.
Then, in the notations of Section 2.2, such non-compact models have nf = 0, nb =
2Nc Nf , and can be represented by a quiver diagram analogous to the one shown in Figure 1,

Nc

Nf
(4.13)

except that now one has to keep in mind that gauge node represented by a circle stands
for the SU rather than SO gauge group. In a gauge theory with SU (Nc ) gauge group, the
contribution of 2d (0, 1) vector multiplet to the perturbative gauge anomaly is −Nc . And,
each “flavor,” equivalent to 2d (0, 2) chiral multiplet in the fundamental representation of
G, contributes +1 to the perturbative gauge anomaly, cf. [4, 41]. Therefore, the anomaly
cancellation condition (2.11) in this case reads
Nf = Nc

(4.14)

and the gravitational anomaly (2.13) is

In the notations of Section 2.4, this family of non-compact (0, 1) models had Y = R2Nc
and, therefore, at the intermediate energy scales flows to a NLSM with target space (2.18):

X = Y /G = R2Nc /SU (Nc )

and a skyscraper sheaf (comprised from the fermions of the vector multiplet) supported at
2
2
the origin of X. The quotient space X is a cone on S 2Nc −1 /SU (Nc ), where R2Nc itself is
2
viewed as a cone on S 2Nc −1 .
In order to understand the geometry of this quotient better, let us consider the simplest
non-trivial theory in this family, namely the case of Nc = Nf = 2. At the intermediate
energy scales it can be described by a NLSM with target space X which is quotient of Y =
R8 ∼
= C4 by G = SU (2). Note, C4 is a fundamental representation of the symmetry group
SU (4) and there are three homomorphisms SU (2)c × SU (2)f → SU (4), which correspond
to three different topological twists of 4d N = 4 super-Yang-Mills [42]. The one relevant
for us here, in which C4 is realized as Nf = 2 copies of the fundamental representation of
SU (2), corresponds to the Hopf fibration S 3 → S 7 → S 4 . In other words, the quotient
space S 7 /SU (2) ∼
= S 4 and X ∼
= Cone(S 4 ) = R5 . It is therefore tempting to conjecture
that 2d (0, 1) SQCD with Nc = Nf = 2 in the IR flows to a theory of 5 free (0, 1) scalar
multiplets.12
A natural way to test this duality might be to start with 2d N = (0, 2) SQCD that
has Nc = 2, Nf = 4 and is dual to 2d N = (0, 2) Landau-Ginzburg model with 6 chiral
(0, 2) multiplets [41]. Then, just like in 3d dualities related by soft supersymmetry breaking
[16, 17], one would expect that deforming both sides of 2d (0, 2) duality [41] by dual relevant
operators that preserve only 2d N = (0, 1) supersymmetry one should end up with a 2d
(0, 1) duality involving Nc = Nf = 2 SQCD considered here.
Another way to prove or disprove whether 2d (0, 1) SQCD with Nc = Nf = 2 flows to
a theory of 5 free (0, 1) scalar multiplets is by realizing this 2d gauge theory as a 3d gauge
theory on an interval with half-BPS boundary conditions a la [44, 45]. For example, a 2d
(0, 1) sigma-model on a group manifold SU (2) can be realized in this way by imposing
Dirichlet boundary conditions on both sides of the interval in 3d N = 1 super-ChernSimons theory [2]. If, instead, we impose Neumann boundary conditions on both sides,
then the gauge symmetry is preserved and we obtain a 2d N = (0, 1) gauge theory with
gauge group G = SU (2). In this model, the gauge anomaly needs to be canceled, and
the anomaly inflow from 3d at the two boundaries is +k + 1 and −k + 1, where k is
the Chern-Simons level and +1 is the contribution of fermions (which has opposite sign
compared to the case of Dirichlet boundary condition [45]). Note, that the Chern-Simons
term contributes with opposite signs since the relative orientation of the boundaries is
reversed.
When k = 1, several nice things happen. First, this is the smallest value of k for
which 3d N = 1 super-Chern-Simons does not break supersymmetry; in fact, in the IR it
is believed to have only one quantum ground state [46]. Secondly, at k = 1 the anomaly
at one boundary vanishes and the anomaly at the second boundary is +1 + 1 = 2. It can
be canceled by 4 fundamental (0, 1) scalars, i.e. Nf = 2 fundamental (0, 2) chirals. Not
surprisingly, this is the same anomaly-free matter content of 2d (0, 1) SQCD with Nc = 2
that we found earlier. And, since the physics on one of the boundaries is trivial and the

Somewhat similar behavior was proposed in two-dimensional theories with larger supersymmetry [43],
where it was argued that RG flow flattens a conical target space into a free IR theory.

bulk SU (2)1 theory has a unique gapped SUSY vacuum, in the IR this sandwich of 3d-2d
theories flows to a theory of gauge-invariant operators on the second boundary, i.e. NLSM
with target C4 /SU (2) ∼
= R5 that we found earlier via a different but similar route.13
In order to gain a new perspective on 2d (0, 1) SQCD (4.13), we need a 3d theory
sandwiched by two half-BPS boundary conditions such that Nf fundamental matter fields
also have a 3d origin. The most natural 3d theory that meets these criteria is a 3d N = 1
vector multiplet coupled to Nf = Nc copies of 3d N = 2 chiral multiplets in the fundamental representation of G = SU (Nc ). Equivalently, this theory can be viewed as a 3d
N = 2 theory with Nf = Nc fundamental chirals, from which half of the gauginos have
been removed. However, the IR physics of such 3d N = 1 theories does not appear to be
understood at the time of this writing.

Cohomology and characteristic classes of real Grassmannians

the Grassmannian of unoriented n-planes in RN we have

O(n) × O(N − n)

It follows that the Grassmannian is the fiber of the following fibation of the classifying
spaces:
Gr(n, N ) −→ BO(n) × BO(N − n) −→ BO(N ).

(A.2)

In other words, Gr(n, N ) can be understood as the classifying space for pairs of rank-n
and rank-(N − n) bundles whose direct sum is a trivial rank-N bundle. To determine the
cohomology of the Grassmannian, it is then enough to know the cohomology of BO(n) and

3d N = 1 super-Chern-Simons SU (Nc )k at level k = N2c . At this special value of k, the anomalies at the
two boundaries are k + N2c = Nc and −k + N2c = 0. In the IR, the bulk 3d theory has only one gapped
SUSY vacuum and the effective 2d (0, 1) physics is described by mesons on a “non-trivial boundary” that

real vector bundles. In the case of Z2 coefficients, the cohomology of BO(n) is well known
to be freely generated by Stiefel–Whitney classes,
H ∗ (BO(n), Z2 ) ∼
= Z2 [w1 , w2 , . . . , wn ],

deg wi = i.

(A.3)

P
The total Stiefel–Whitney class w := 1 + ni=1 wi of a Whitney sum of bundles is the
product of their total Stiefel–Whitney classes. This gives the following simple explicit
description of the mod-2 cohomology of a real Grassmannian:
H ∗ (Gr(n, N ), Z2 ) ∼
=

Z2 [w1 , w2 , . . . , wn , w1 , w2 , . . . , wN −n ]
. (A.4)
(1 + w1 + w2 + . . . + wn )(1 + w1 + w2 + . . . + wN −n ) = 1

By construction, the classes wi and wi can be identified with the Stiefel–Whitney classes
of the tautological and orthogonal bundles respectively. That is
wi = wi (S),

wi = wi (Q).

(A.5)

The Stiefel–Whiteny classes of the tangent bundle can be determined from the relation
TX ∼
= S⊗Q. Although the Stiefel–Whitney classes of the tensor product can be determined
in terms of Stiefel–Whitney classes of the factors using the splitting principle, the explicit
expressions become quite complicated already in degrees 3 and 4. However they simplify
significantly if the bundles are the same. Namely, for any rank m real vector bundle V we
have
w1 (V
w2 (V
w3 (V
w4 (V

⊗ V ) = 0,
⊗ V ) = (m − 1) w12 (V ),
⊗ V ) = 0,
w14 (V ) + m w22 (V ),
⊗ V ) = (m−1)(m−2)

..
.

(A.6)

Then, using S ⊗ Q ⊕ S ⊗ S = S N1 we have

w(T Gr(n, N )) = w(S ⊗ Q) =

(A.8)

can be deduced simply by setting w1 = w1 = 0 in the above formulas, due to the fact that
H ∗ (BSO(n), Z2 ) ∼
= Z2 [w2 , . . . , wn ],

deg wi = i.

Rational cohomology and rational Pontryagin classes

The cohomology with rational coefficients can be obtained by a similar approach, starting
from the fact that
H ∗ (BO(n), Q) ∼
= Q[p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ],

deg pi = 4i.

(A.10)

This leads to the following description of the cohomology of the Grassmannian,
H ∗ (Gr(n, N ), Q) ∼
=

Q[p1 , p2 , . . . , pn , p1 , p2 , . . . , pN −n ]
,
(1 + p1 + p2 + . . . + pn )(1 + p1 + p2 + . . . + pN −n ) = 1

(A.11)

where the generators are Pontryagin classes of the tautological and orthogonal bundles,
i.e. pi = pi (S) and pi = pi (Q). The total rational Pontryagin class of the tangent bundle
can be obtained again as
p (T Gr(n, N )) = p(S ⊗ Q) =

p(S)N
1 + N p1 + . . .
=
= 1 + (N − 2n)p1 + . . . (A.12)
p(S ⊗ S)
1 + 2np1 + . . .

and using the explicit formulas for the Pontryagin classes of the tensor product. The
f
rational cohomology of the oriented Grassmannian Gr(n,
N ) is the same.
A.3

Integral cohomology

The integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian is quite involved (unlike the case of the
complex Grassmannian), but in principle can be still obtained from the fibration (A.2)
and the knowledge of the integral cohomology of BO(n) (or BSO(n) in the oriented case)
as well as the pullback of the Whitney sum map BO(n) × BO(N − n) → BO(N ) (or
BSO(n) × BSO(N − n) → BSO(N ) in the oriented case) which were described in [47].
When n is sufficiently large, the cohomology of BO(n) in low degrees is generated by
Pontryagin classes as well as the images of Stiefel–Whitney classes under the Bockstein
homomorphism
δ : H ∗ (BO(n), Z2 ) −→ H ∗+1 (BO(n), Z)

(A.13)

associated to the short exact sequence of coefficients
2·

mod 2

Z −→ Z −→ Z2 .

(A.14)

The generators are subject to the certain relations. In low degrees, the cohomology groups
and the independent generators read
i
0
1
2
3
4
...

H i (BO(n), Z)
Z
0
Z2
Z2
Z × Z22
...

generators

δ(w1 )
δ(w2 )
p1 , δ(w1 w2 ), (δ(w1 ))2
...

(A.15)

The cohomology of Gr(n, N ) will be the same in low degrees when n and N are sufficiently
f
low. Similarly, the cohomology of the oriented Grassmannian Gr(n,
N ) in low degrees
coincides with the cohomology of BSO(n):
i
0
1
2
3
4
...

H i (BSO(n), Z)
Z
0
0
Z2
Z
...

generators
1
(A.16)
δ(w2 )
p1
...

The details of the cohomology and the explicit expression for the integral Pontryagin classes
of the tangent bundle will not be actually important for us in this paper. This is because
the torsion part contains only order-2 elements and, therefore, it will be sufficient to work
with mod-2 and rational cohomologies.
