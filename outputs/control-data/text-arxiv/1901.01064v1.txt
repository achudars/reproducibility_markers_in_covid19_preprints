Abstract
A continuous map f from a compact interval I into itself is densely (resp. generically) chaotic if the set of points (x, y) such that lim supn→+∞ |f n (x) − f n (y)| > 0 and
lim inf n→+∞ |f n (x) − f n (y)| = 0 is dense (resp. residual) in I × I. We prove that if the
interval map f is densely but not generically chaotic then there is a descending sequence
of invariant intervals, each of which containing a horseshoe for f 2 . It implies that every
densely chaotic interval map is of type at most 6 for Sharkovskiı̆’s order (that is, there exists
a periodic point of period 6), and its topological entropy is at least log 2/2. We show that
equalities can be realised.

Introduction

This article deals with the dynamics of interval maps, that is, continuous maps f : I → I where
I is a compact interval in R. We first give some notations used in this paper. An invariant set
(for the map f ) is a closed non empty subset A such that f (A) ⊂ A. A transitive subset (for f )
is an invariant set A such that f |A is transitive (see, e.g., [6] for the definition of transitivity).
The length of an interval J is denoted by |J|. An interval J is non degenerate if |J| > 0, that
is, J is neither empty nor reduced to a single point.
In [10] Li and Yorke called chaotic some kind of behaviour of interval maps, although without
formal definition. The following notions of Li-Yorke pairs and Li-Yorke chaos were derived from
this article.
Definition 1.1 Let T : X → X be a continuous map on a metric space X. If x, y ∈ X and
δ > 0, (x, y) is called a Li-Yorke pair of modulus δ if
lim sup d(T n (x), T n (y)) > δ

and

n→+∞

lim inf d(T n (x), T n (y)) = 0;
n→+∞

(x, y) is a Li-Yorke pair if it is a Li-Yorke pair of modulus δ for some δ > 0. The set of Li-Yorke
pairs of modulus δ is denoted by LY(T, δ) and the set of Li-Yorke pairs by LY(T ).
Definition 1.2 Let T : X → X be a continuous map on a metric space X. The system (X, T )
is said chaotic in the sense of Li-Yorke if there exists an uncountable set S ⊂ X such that for
all x, y ∈ S, x 6= y, (x, y) is a Li-Yorke pair.
The definition of generic chaos is due to Lasota (see [13]). Being inspired by this definition,
Snoha defined generic δ-chaos, dense chaos and dense δ-chaos [16].
Definition 1.3 Let T : X → X be a continuous map on a metric space X and δ > 0.

• T is generically chaotic if LY(T ) is residual in X 2 ,
• T is generically δ-chaotic if LY(T, δ) is residual in X 2 ,
• T is densely chaotic if LY(T ) is dense in X 2 ,
• T is densely δ-chaotic if LY(T, δ) is dense in X 2 .
Generic δ-chaos obviously implies both generic chaos and dense δ-chaos, which in turn imply
dense chaos.
In [16], Snoha proved that for an interval map generic chaos implies generic δ-chaos for
some δ > 0 and the notions of generic δ-chaos and dense δ-chaos coincide, but a densely chaotic
interval map may be not generically chaotic. In [17] Snoha gave a characterisation of densely
chaotic interval maps and proved that for piecewise monotone interval maps the notions of
dense chaos and generic chaos coincide. He asked what the infimum of topological entropy and
the type for Sharkovskiı̆’s order are for densely chaotic interval maps. We recall Sharkovskiı̆’s
theorem (see [18]):
Theorem 1.4 (Sharkovskiı̆[14]) Consider the following order:
3  5  7  9  · · ·  2 · 3  2 · 5  2 · 7  · · ·  22 · 3  23 · 5  · · ·  2n  · · · 23  22  2  1
If the interval map f has a periodic point of period n then it has periodic points of period m for
all m  n.
According to Theorem 1.4, the set of periods of periodic points of an interval map f is, either
{m | m  n} for some positive integer n, and in this case f is said of type n, or {2n | n ≥ 0},
and f is said of type 2∞ . Remark that there exist interval maps of all types [18, 5].
Our first motivation was to answer Snoha’s questions. In Theorem 3.1, we actually obtain
a result on the structure of interval maps that are densely chaotic but not generically chaotic:
for such a map f , there exists a descending sequence of invariant intervals, with lengths tending
to 0, and each of them contains a horseshoe for the map f 2 (that is, two closed non degenerate
intervals J, K with disjoint interiors such that f 2 (J) ∩ f 2 (K) ⊃ J ∪ K). On the other hand,
Snoha gave a characterisation of generic chaos in term of transitive subintervals:
Theorem 1.5 (Snoha [16]) Let f be an interval map. The following conditions are equivalent:
• f is generically chaotic,
• either there exists a unique transitive non degenerate subinterval, or there exist two transitive non degenerate subintervals with a common endpoint. Moreover for every non degenerate interval J, f n (J) is non degenerate and there exist a transitive subinterval T and
an integer n ≥ 0 such that f n (J) ∩ Int (T ) 6= ∅.
We deduce from the structure of densely chaotic interval maps that such maps are at most
of type 6 for Sharkovskiı̆’s order and their topological entropy is greater than or equal to log2 2
(Corollary 3.6). Example 3.7 shows that equalities are possible, and in addition they can be
realised by generically chaotic interval maps.
In [11] Murinová generalised Snoha’s work and showed that for a complete metric space
X, generic δ-chaos and dense δ-chaos are equivalent. She also exhibited a generically chaotic
system which is not generically δ-chaotic for any δ > 0.

If X is a complete metric space and G ⊂ X × X is a dense Gδ -set then using Kuratowski’s
theorem (see, e.g.,[12]) one can find an uncountable set S such that S × S deprived of the
diagonal of X × X is included in G (see e.g., [7, Lemma 3.1]). Therefore a generically chaotic
map on a complete metric space is chaotic in the sense of Li-Yorke. In [8], Kuchta and Smı́tal
showed that on the interval the existence of one Li-Yorke pair is enough to imply chaos in the
sense of Li-Yorke, consequently dense chaos implies Li-Yorke chaos for interval maps. However
it is not known whether dense chaos implies Li-Yorke chaos in general.
Section 3 contains our main results. Some preliminary lemmas are needed, they are stated
in Section 2

Preliminary results

Lemma 2.1 Let f be a densely chaotic interval map.
1. If J is a non degenerate interval then f n (J) is non degenerate for all n ≥ 0.
2. Consider disjoint non degenerate intervals J1 , . . . , Jp such that f (Ji ) ⊂ Ji+1 mod p . Then
either p = 1, or p = 2 and J1 , J2 have a common endpoint. If the intervals Ji are closed
then p = 1.
3. If J, J 0 are invariant non degenerate intervals, then J ∩ J 0 6= ∅.
Proof.
i) If J is a non degenerate interval then there exists (x, y) ∈ J × J such that (x, y) is a Li-Yorke
pair, thus lim supn→+∞ |f n (J)| > 0 and for every n ≥ 0 the interval f n (J) is not reduced to a
point.
ii) Let J1 , . . . , Jp be disjoint non degenerate intervals such that f (Ji ) ⊂ Ji+1 mod p . Suppose that
there exist 0 ≤ i, j ≤ p such that the distance D between Ji and Jj is positive. By continuity
there exists η > 0 such that if |x − y| < η then |f k (x) − f k (y)| < D for all 0 ≤ k ≤ p. If (x, y) ∈
Ji × Jj then for all l ≥ 0 one has |f lp (x) − f lp (y)| ≥ D thus for all n ≥ 0 |f n (x) − f n (y)| ≥ η,
which contradicts the assumption that f is densely chaotic. If the intervals Ji are closed it
implies that p = 1; otherwise it implies that p = 1 or p = 2, and if p = 2 then J1 and J2 have a
common endpoint.
iii) Let J, J 0 be two invariant non degenerate intervals. Then there exists a Li-Yorke pair (x, x0 )
in J × J 0 , in particular there exists an increasing sequence (ni ) such that limi→+∞ |f ni (x) −
f ni (x0 )| = 0. By compactness there exist (mi ) a subsequence of (ni ) and a point z such that
limi→+∞ f mi (x) = limi→+∞ f mi (x0 ) = z and the point z belongs to J ∩ J 0 .
2
Lemma 2.2 Let f be a densely chaotic interval map. Suppose that there exists a sequence of
non degenerate
invariant intervals (Jn )n≥0 such that limn→+∞ |Jn | = 0. Then there exists a
T
point z ∈ n≥0 Jn and f (z) = z.
Moreover there exists a subsequence of closed non degenerate intervals (Jn0 )n≥0 such that
0
f (Jn0 ) ⊂ Jn0 , limn→+∞ |Jn0 | = 0 and for all n ≥ 0, Jn+1
is included in the interior of Jn0 with
respect to the induced topology on J00 .

Proof. First we show that +∞
for all N ≥ 0 then +∞
n=0 Jn 6= ∅. If n=0 Jn is non degenerate T
n=0 Jn
N
is not empty. Otherwise let N ≥ 0 be the greatest integer such that n=0 Jn is non degenerate.
T
The interval K = N
n=0 Jn is closed, non degenerate and f (K) ⊂ K. By Lemma 2.1(iii),
3

JN +1 ∩ K 6= ∅ thus the set JN +1 ∩ K is reduced to one point z. For every n ≥ 0 one has
Jn ∩TK 6= ∅ and Jn ∩ JN +1 6= ∅ by Lemma 2.1(iii) thus by connectedness z ∈ Jn . Consequently
z ∈ +∞
.
n=0 JnT
The set +∞
n=0 Jn is reduced to a single point z because |Jn | → 0. One has f (z) = z because
f (Jn ) ⊂ Jn for all n ≥ 0.
There exists an increasing sequence (ni )i≥0Tsuch that either Jni ∩(z, +∞) 6= ∅ for all i ≥ 0 or
Jni ∩ (−∞, z) 6= ∅ for all i ≥ 0. Define Kn = ni=0 Jni ; this is a closed non degenerate interval,
f (Kn ) ⊂ Kn and Kn+1 ⊂ Kn .
Case 1. There exists an increasing sequence (mi )i≥0 such that Kmi+1 ⊂ Int (Kmi ) for all i ≥ 0.
Take then Ji0 = Kmi .
Case 2. If the assumption of case 1 is not satisfied then there exists N ≥ 0 such that for all
n ≥ N , Kn 6⊂ Int (KN ), that is, either min Kn = min KN for all n ≥ N or max Kn = max KN
for all n ≥ N . Since |Kn | → 0 one can find an increasing sequence (mi )i≥0 with m0 = N such
that |Kmi+1 | < |Kmi | for all i ≥ 0. In this case Ji0 = Kmi is a suitable subsequence of intervals.
2
Lemma 2.3 Let J be a bounded interval and f : J → J a continuous map with no fixed point.
If K ⊂ J is a compact interval then lim |f n (K)| = 0.
n→+∞

Proof. Suppose that f (x) < x for all x ∈ J, the case f (x) > x for all x ∈ J being similar.
Write f n (K) = [an , bn ]. For every n ≥ 0 there exists x ∈ [an , bn ] such that f (x) = bn+1 , thus
bn+1 < x ≤ bn . The sequence (bn )n≥0 is decreasing thus has a limit in J; let z = limn→+∞ bn .
Suppose that z ∈ J. Let ε > 0 such that f (z) + ε < z. By continuity there exists η > 0 such
that if |x − z| < η then |f (x) − f (z)| < ε. Let n ≥ 0 such that |bn − z| < η. Then for all
x ∈ [z, bn ] one has f (x) < f (z) + ε < z and for all x ∈ [an , z) one has f (x) < x < z. This
implies that bn+1 < z, which is absurd. Hence z = inf J and z < an ≤ bn for all n ≥ 0. This
implies that |f n (K)| ≤ |bn − z| → 0 when n goes to infinity.
2
Proposition 2.4 (Snoha [16]) Let f be an interval map and δ > 0. The following conditions
are equivalent:
• f is generically δ-chaotic,

• for all non degenerate intervals J1 , J2 one has lim supn→+∞ |f n (J1 )| > δ and lim inf n→+∞ dist(f n (J1 ), f n (J
0 (where dist(·, ·) denotes the distance between two sets),
Lemma 2.5 Let f be a densely chaotic interval map. Suppose that there exists ε > 0 such that,
for every non degenerate invariant interval J, |J| ≥ ε. Then f is generically chaotic.
Proof. Suppose that
∀δ > 0, ∃ J closed non degenerate interval, ∀n ≥ 0, |f n (J)| ≤ δ.

(1)

We are going to show that is not possible. Let 0 < δ < ε/4 and let J be a closed non degenerate
interval such that |f n (J)| ≤ δ for all n ≥ 0. There exists a Li-Yorke pair (x, y) ∈ J × J because
f is densely chaotic, thus
lim sup |f n (J)| > 0.
(2)
n→+∞

This implies that there exist N, p such that f N (J) ∩ f N +p (J) 6= ∅, thus f n (J) ∩ f n+p (J) 6= ∅
for all n S
≥ N . Since f n (J) is an interval, this implies that, for every 0S≤ i ≤ p − 1, the
set Zi = k≥0 f N +i+kp (J) is an interval, too. Consequently, the set Z = n≥N f n (J) has at
most p connected components, which are non degenerate by Lemma 2.1(i). The image of a
connected component is connected and f (Zi ) ⊂ Zi+1 mod p , thus the connected components of
Z are necessarily cyclically mapped into each other and Lemma 2.1(ii) applies: Z has, either
one connected component, or two connected components with a common endpoint, and Z is a
closed interval.
If there exist a point z and an integer n0 ≥ N such that f 2 (z) = z and z ∈ f n0 (J) then
S
z ∈ f n0 +2k (J) for all k ≥ 0. Since |f n (J)| ≤ δ for all n ≥ 0 one gets that k≥0 f n0 +2k (J) ≤ 2δ
S
S
n0 +2k+1 (J) ≤ 2δ. Let L =
n0 −N (Z). Then L is a closed non
n
and
k≥0 f
n≥n0 f (J) = f
degenerate interval, f (L) ⊂ L and |L| ≤ 4δ. Moreover |L| ≥ ε according to the hypothesis
of the Lemma, which is a contradiction because we have chosen δ < ε/4. We deduce that Z
contains no point z such that f 2 (z) = z.
Let Z0 be the connected component of Z containing f N (J) and put g = f 2 . Then g(Z0 ) ⊂ Z0
and g|Z0 has no fixed point. The interval K = f N (J) is compact because J is compact
and f N is continuous, so Lemma 2.3 applies and we get that limn→+∞ |f N +2n (J)| = 0. By
continuity of f we get that |f n (J)| → 0 when n goes to infinity, which contradicts Equation (2). We conclude that Equation (1) is false, consequently there exists δ > 0 such that
for all closed non degenerate intervals J, lim supn→+∞ |f n (J)| ≥ δ. The map f is densely
chaotic thus for every non degenerate intervals J1 , J2 there is a Li-Yorke pair in J1 × J2 , hence
lim inf n→+∞ dist(f n (J1 ), f n (J2 )) = 0. Then Proposition 2.4 implies that f is generically chaotic.

Structure of densely chaotic interval maps

Recall that the interval map g has a horseshoe if there exist two closed non degenerate subintervals J, K with disjoint interiors such that g(J) ∩ g(K) ⊃ J ∪ K.
Theorem 3.1 Let f be an interval map. If f is densely chaotic but not generically chaotic then
there exists a sequence of invariant non degenerate subintervals (Jn )n≥0 such that Jn+1 ⊂ Jn ,
limn→+∞ |Jn | = 0, and f 2 |Jn has a horseshoe for all n ≥ 0.
We need two lemmas in the proof of this theorem. Lemma 3.2 is proven in [9] under slightly
weaker hypotheses, see also [4, p 28]. Lemma 3.3 can be found in [4, p31].
Lemma 3.2 Let f be an interval map with no horseshoe and x a point . Write xn = f n (x) for
all n ≥ 0. Suppose that xn+1 ≥ xn and xm+1 ≤ xm . Then xn ≤ xm .
Lemma 3.3 Let f be an interval map such that f 2 has no horseshoe. Let x be a point which is
not ultimately periodic and write xn = f n (x) for n ≥ 0. Suppose that there exists k0 ≥ 2 such
that either xk0 < x0 < x1 or xk0 > x0 > x1 . Then there exist a fixed point z and an integer N
such that, for all n ≥ N , xn > z ⇔ xn+1 < z.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. By assumption the map f is not generically chaotic thus, by Lemma 2.5,
∀ε > 0, there exists an invariant non degenerate interval J such that |J| < ε.
Let (In )n≥0 be a sequence of invariant non degenerate intervals In such that |In | → 0. By
Lemma 2.2 there exists a sequence of invariant non degenerate intervals (Jn )n≥0 such that
5

limn→+∞ |Jn | = 0, and Jn+1 ⊂ Int (Jn ) with respect to the induced topology on J0 . From now
on we fix n0 ≥ 0 and we restrict to the interval Jn0 . The map f |Jn0 is densely chaotic, the set
T
n≥n0 Jn is reduced to a single point z and f (z) = z. Let
P = {x ∈ Jn0 | ∃p ≥ 1, lim f np (x) exists}.
n→+∞

If x, y ∈ P then (x, y) is not a Li-Yorke pair, thus the set Jn0 \ P is not empty.
Assume that f 2 |Jn0 has no horseshoe; we are going to prove that this is absurd. Let x0 ∈
Jn0 \ P and write xn = f n (x0 ) for all n ≥ 0. According to Lemma 3.3 there exist a fixed point
c and an integer N such that, for all n ≥ 0, xN +2n < c < xN +2n+1 . Suppose for instance that
c ≤ z, the case with reverse inequality being symmetric. Since x0 6∈ P the sequence (xN +2n )n≥0
is not ultimately monotone, thus there exists i ≥ 0 such that
xN +2i+2 < xN +2i < c ≤ z.
By continuity there exists a closed non degenerate interval K containing xN +2i such that z 6∈ K
and for all y ∈ K, f 2 (y) < y. Let k ≥ n0 such that K < Jk .
The set K×K contains a Li-Yorke pair because f is densely chaotic, thus lim supn→+∞ |f n (K)| >
S
0 and there exist p, q such that f q+p (K) ∩ f q (K) 6= ∅. Let L = n≥q f n (K). One has f (L) ⊂ L.
The same argument as for Z in the proof of Lemma 2.5 implies that L is an invariant non
degenerate interval. Moreover Lemma 2.1(iii) implies that L ∩ Jn 6= ∅ for all n ≥ n0 . Since
Jk+1 ⊂ Int (Jk ), this implies that there exists an integer n ≥ 0 such that f n (K) ∩ Int (Jk ) 6= ∅,
thus there exists a closed non degenerate subinterval K 0 ⊂ K such that f n (K 0 ) ⊂ Jk .
Let m0 ≥ n/2 and g = f 2 . For all y ∈ K 0 and all m ≥ m0 one has g m (y) ∈ Jk because
f (Jk ) ⊂ Jk , thus
g(y) < y < g m (y).
This implies that there exists 0 < j < m0 such that g j (y) < g j+1 (y). By assumption g has no
horseshoe thus g j (y) ≤ y by Lemma 3.2. For all m ≥ m0 , one has y ≤ g m (y), thus the same
lemma implies that g m+1 (y) ≤ g m (y). Consequently, (g m (y))m≥m0 is a non increasing sequence,
thus it converges. But this implies that K 0 × K 0 contains no Li-Yorke pair, which contradicts
the fact that f is densely chaotic. This concludes the proof.
2
Next theorem sums up two results on horseshoes, the first point is due to Block and Coppel
[3], the second one derives from [2] (see also [4, p 196]).
Theorem 3.4 Let f be an interval map with a horseshoe. Then
• f is of type 3 for Sharkovskiı̆’s order,
• htop (f ) ≥ log 2.
According to Theorem 1.5, a generically chaotic interval map f admits a transitive subinterval, thus next theorem implies that f 2 has a horseshoe.
Theorem 3.5 (Block-Coven [1]) Let f be a transitive interval map. Then f 2 has a horseshoe.
Corollary 3.6 Let f be a densely chaotic interval map. Then f 2 has a horseshoe, htop (f ) ≥
log 2
2 and f is of type at most 6 for Sharkovskiı̆’s order.

6

Proof. If f is generically chaotic then f 2 has a horseshoe by Theorems 1.5 and 3.5, otherwise f 2
has a horseshoe by Theorem 3.1. By Theorem 3.4, htop (f ) ≥ log2 2 and f 2 has a periodic point
of period 3, thus f has a periodic point of period 3 or 6.
2
Example 3.7 In Corollary 3.6 equalities are possible. Consider the “square-root” of the tent
map, pictured on Figure 1. The map g swaps the intervals [0, 1/2] and [1/2, 1] thus every
periodic point x 6= 1/2 has an even period. Moreover the intervals [0, 1/4], [1/4, 1/2] form a
horseshoe for g 2 , so Theorem 3.4 implies that g is of type 6 for Sharkovskiı̆’s order. The map
g 2 restricted to either [0, 1/2] or [1/2, 1] is the classical tent map (upside down on [0, 1/2]),
which is known to be mixing (see, e.g., [4, p 159]), so g is transitive (thus generically chaotic).
Finally the topological entropy of g 2 is equal to log 2 (use either the fact that it is Markov or
the combination of Theorem 3.4 and [6, Proposition (14.20)]), hence htop (g) = log2 2 .

and type 6.

This example shows that the infimum of the topological entropy of densely (respectively
generically) chaotic interval maps is reached and is equal to log2 2 .
There also exist transitive (thus generically chaotic) interval maps of type 2k + 1 for all
k ≥ 1 [1]. It derives from [2] that the topological entropy of a map of type 2k + 1 is greater
than log2 2 .
