We study geodesics in the Schwarzschild space-time affected by an uncertainty in the mass parameter described by a Gaussian distribution. This study could serve as a first attempt at investigating
possible quantum effects of black hole space-times on the motion of matter in their surroundings as
well as the role of uncertainties in the measurement of the black hole parameters.

INTRODUCTION

Black holes were always one of the characterising predictions of General Relativity (GR) [1, 2], and the recent
detection of gravitational waves from the merging of black hole binaries [3] has further boosted the interest in such
astrophysical objects. The mathematical properties of these vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations are already
problematic at the classical level, where it is well known that no sensible energy-momentum tensor can be associated
with them [4]. It becomes even more problematic at the quantum level, since our very limited understanding from
semiclassical approaches yield the famous Hawking radiation [5] and a bunch of paradoxes (see, e.g. Refs. [6–11] and
references therein).
On the other hand, our observational capacities remain relatively weak in determining with precision what astrophysical black holes are in nature, and a host of alternative, somewhat more exotic, compact objects are actively being
investigated in the present literature (see e.g. Refs. [11–22]). In this respect, it is very important to determine the
physical consequences of alternative models of compact objects or alternative descriptions of gravity on observable
quantities, regardless of the origin of such deviations from the simple black hole metrics of GR.
For example, the Horizon Quantum Mechanics [23–26] offers an alternative perspective to the semiclassical approach
to gravity, whose aim is to put under the spotlight the quantum features of a black hole’s geometric structure inherited
by a purely quantum mechanical description of its source. In this regard, the location of trapping surfaces becomes
fuzzy because of the quantum mechanical nature of the source, thus providing a clear motivation for the study
presented here.
Another motivation can be found in light of the theory of stochastic gravity (see e.g. [27] and references therein),
which offers an extension of semiclassical gravity based on the classical Einstein equations sourced by the stress-energy
tensor of quantum matter fields by including the contribution of quantum fluctuations to the vacuum expectation
values of matter. Specifically, these fluctuations are accounted for by means of a noise kernel bitensor, and the
semiclassical Einstein equations are replaced by the so called Einstein-Langevin equations.
In this work, after reviewing some generalities on the structure of the orbits in both Newtonian gravity and GR,
we analyze the geodesics of a Schwarzschild space-time 1 [28, 29]

ORBITS IN NEWTONIAN GRAVITY AND IN THE SCHWARZSCHILD GEOMETRY

where the parameter γ = 1 in GR and γ = 0 (and ε = 1) in Newtonian gravity. Eq. (2) formally resembles the
equation for a classical particle of unit mass and energy E moving in a one-dimensional potential 2 V (the conserved
energy per unit mass is E, but the effective potential corresponds to E = E 2 /2).

We use units with c = 1 and denote the Newton constant with G.
The potential V is actually the potential energy (per unit mass).

Circular orbits

The stationary points of the potential V represent circular orbits, whose radius rc is thus given by
0=

∼ ε G M rc2 − L2 rc + 3 γ G M L2 .

(4)

r=rc

Of course, these circular orbits are stable (unstable) if they correspond to a minimum (maximum) of the potential.
1.

Newtonian gravity

In Newtonian gravity (γ = 0), we have the following well-known results:
a) For massless particles (ε = 0) no circular orbits exist. In fact, bound orbits do not exist in general (massless
particles move on a straight line).
b) For massive particles (ε = 1) there are stable circular orbits at the radius
L2

(5)

as well as bound orbits that oscillate around the radius rc . In general, if the energy is greater than the asymptotic
value 3 E = 1, the orbits are unbound (parabolas or hyperbolas), otherwise they are bound (circles or ellipses).
rc =

2.

General Relativity

In GR (γ = 1), the term G M L2 /r3 becomes important when r is small and the potential V vanishes at the
Schwarzschild radius r = 2 G M . The following general results are also well-known:
a) For massless particles (ε = 0), we find
rc = 3 G M ≡ rph ,

(6)

which represents the innermost (unstable) circular orbit of a photon. Note that the radius of this orbit does not
depend on L.
b) For massive particles (ε = 1), the zeros of Eq. (4) are given by

Hence, when L > 12 G M ≈ 3.46 GM (that is χ is real), there is an inner unstable circular orbit (rin = r− )
and a outer stable circular orbit (rout = r+ ). For large L, we have
lim rin = 3 G M ,

L→∞

(8)

so that the unstable orbit approaches the massless orbit (6), whereas
rout ∼

(9)

and the stable circular orbit moves farther and farther away, approaching the Newtonian
expression (5). Con√
versely, decreasing L the two orbits come closer together and coincide for L = 12 G M . The common radius
of this (stable) circular orbit is 4
rc = 2 rph = 6 G M .
√
Finally, no circular orbits are possible when L < 12 G M (since χ becomes imaginary).

This follows from V (r → ∞) = 1/2 in Eq. (2).
This is the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO).

B.

Non-circular orbits

Non-circular orbits in GR are not perfectly closed ellipses. Nonetheless, they can be viewed, to a good level of
approximation, as ellipses that precess. Thus, it is rather convenient to describe the evolution of the radial coordinate
r as a function of the angular coordinate ϕ, i.e. r = r (ϕ).

• if x1 < 0 (i.e. κ > 1), the orbit is a hyperbola, and x2 represents again the distance of closest approach.
For massless particles (ε = 0), −κ ≤ x ≤ κ and the orbit is always an unbound straight line.
2.

General Relativity

In the GR case (γ = 1), the cubic polynomial on the right-hand side of Eq. (15) admits three roots, which we
denote by x1 , x2 and x3 , so that
 2
dx
= ρ (x − x1 ) (x − x2 ) (x − x3 ) ,

with x1 + x2 + x3 = 1/ρ. The general solution of Eq. (21) is

2
where sn (z, k) is the Jacobi elliptic function with argument z and elliptic modulus
r

.
k=
x3 − x1

(22)

(23)

The integration constant δ is again found from the initial condition x(ϕ0 ) = x0 .
The roots x1 , x2 and x3 can either be all real, or one real and two complex conjugates. In the first case, we name
the roots such that x1 6 x2 6 x3 , while in the second case we denote the real root as x1 . The following situations are
therefore possible:
• x1 < x2 < x3 : if all three roots are distinct real numbers, the second derivative
d2 x
ρ
= [(x − x2 ) (x − x3 ) + (x − x1 ) (x − x3 ) + (x − x1 ) (x − x2 )]
(24)

dϕ

is positive, negative, and positive at x = x1 , x = x2 , and x = x3 , respectively. It follows that a graph of x versus
ϕ can either oscillate between x1 and x2 , or it can move away from x3 towards infinity (which corresponds to
r → 0). If x1 < 0, only part of an oscillation will actually occur. This corresponds to the particle coming
from infinity, getting near the central mass, and then moving away again toward infinity, like the hyperbolic
trajectory in the Newtonian case.
• x1 < x2 = x3 : if the particle has just the right amount of energy (for a given angular momentum), x2 and x3
will merge. The radius rin ∼ 1/x2 = 1/x3 is called the inner radius, and we have 3/2 ρ 6 rin 6 3 ρ. There are
three solutions in this case:
1. the orbit spirals into rin , approaching the inner radius (asymptotically) as a decreasing exponential in ϕ,
τ , or t, or
2. one can have a circular orbit at the inner radius rin , or
3. one can have an orbit that spirals down from the inner radius rin towards the central singularity.
Since sn (z, 1) = tanh (z), in this case Eq. (22) simplifies to
ϕ p

x (ϕ) = x1 + (x2 − x1 ) tanh2
ρ (x2 − x1 ) + δ .
2

(25)

• x1 = x2 < x3 : a circular orbit also results when x1 = x2 . In this case, the radius rout ∼ 1/x1 = 1/x2 , is called
the outer radius.
• x2 , x3 ∈ C: if the particle approaches the center with enough energy and sufficiently low angular momentum
then only x1 will be real. This corresponds to the particle spiraling and falling into a black hole with a finite
change in ϕ.
Equivalent forms of the above solutions are briefly reviewed in Appendix A.

III.

THE CENTRAL MASS AS A RANDOM VARIABLE

We shall now consider the mass M as a random variable, assumed to be normally distributed with mean value M0
2
and standard deviation σM (the variance is σM
) [30]. Equivalently, we may denote the mass M as M0 + δM , where
2
δM is a random variable with zero mean value, µδM = 0, and variance σM
, that is

2
δM ∼ N 0, σM
,
(26)

where N µz , σz2 is the normalised Gaussian distribution of mean value µz .
Since δM is a random variable, any trajectory parametrised as r = r(ϕ), will be a functional of this random variable
which, for a given value of the angle ϕ, will therefore become a random variable itself. In order to stress that the
angle ϕ is now seen as a parameter, and δM is treated as an independent (random) variable, we shall employ the
notation r = rϕ (δM ).
Since Eq. (12) has the known analytical solution (22), it is conceivable to carry out the analysis of the probability
distribution of rϕ , representing the position of the particle at a given angle ϕ, without relying on any perturbation
methods.
In order to show explicitly the dependence on the mass M , we first rewrite Eq. (21) [equivalent to Eq. (12)] as

and u(ϕ0 ) = u0 . It is important to remark that u1 , u2 , u3 , δ, ρ and k are now all functions of M . Since we are
assuming M to be a random variable with a given probability density function fM , the variable uϕ ≡ u(ϕ) will turn
into a random variable with probability distribution fUϕ .
As customary in probability theory, from now on we shall indicate the random variables with capital letters (M
and Uϕ , respectively for the mass and the dependent variable uϕ ) and with lowercase letters (m and uϕ , respectively),
the values taken on by the random variables. We can therefore write Eq. (27) as
Uϕ = u1 + (u2 − u1 ) sn2

(31)

In order to determine the probability density function fUϕ of the random variable Uϕ , it is useful to work with its
cumulative distribution function FUϕ (uϕ ), defined as the probability P of Uϕ taking on values smaller then or equal
to uϕ . Since Uϕ is a monotonically increasing function of M (which we shall denote with the symbol g, Uϕ = g(M )),
we have
FUϕ (uϕ ) = P(Uϕ 6 uϕ ) = P(0 6 M 6 m)

Were the function g monotonically decreasing, the previous derivation could be repeated just changing the sign of the

which would lead to

|g (m)|

(35)

The case of a non-monotonic function g can be treated similarly, just splitting the integration range so as to have
a monotonic function in each interval. It is then easy to see that, if the function fUϕ has N roots, which we denote
as uϕ = g(mk ), for k = 1, 2, . . . , N , we obtain the general formula
fUϕ (uϕ ) =

N
X
fM (mk )
k=1

|g 0 (mk )|

(36)

The validity of the previous relation is not limited to Uϕ and M . In order to stress this, and for future use, the
previous relation can be written as
fY (y) =

N

fX (xk )
,
|g 0 (xk )|

(37)

k=1

for a generic random variable Y function of X (with whatever probability density function fX ), such that Y = g(X).
It is possible to extend the idea described above and to assume other parameters as random variables as well, not
just the mass M . For instance, the initial position u0 of the particle can be assumed as a random variable. In such
a case, Eq. (37) can be applied, where the dependent and independent random variables are Uϕ and U0 , respectively,
and Uϕ = g(U0 ).
The next step, is to assume more parameters simultaneously as random variables. For example, the energy E and
the angular momentum L might actually be considered as random variables with mean values equal to their nominal
2
2
values (say µE and µL , respectively) and variances accounting for their uncertainties (say σE
and σL
, respectively).

E


2
L ∼ N µL , σL
. In this case it is also conceivable that the variables E and L are not independent. In this scenario,
it could be more accurate to introduce a joint probability density function fEL (e, l), instead of two independent
probability density functions fE (e) and fL (l) for the energy and angular momentum separately. This approach is of
course more general, and the case of independent variables could be recovered when fEL (e, l) = fE (e) fL (l).
This idea can be generalised even further. If the energy E, the angular momentum L, and the initial position u0
are all affected by uncertainties and should be treated as random variables, we could have a joint probability density
function fELU0 (e, l, u0 ). In all these cases, the variable Uϕ representing the quantity u at some angle ϕ would be a
multivariate random variable, i.e. a function of more than one random variable. We shall continue to use the symbol
g for this function. However, a straightforward generalisation of Eq. (37) to this case does not appear possible.
In the case of two random variables, say E and L, with joint probability density function fEL , a procedure similar
to the one presented for the case where M is treated as a random variable would yield
FUϕ (uϕ ) = P(Uϕ 6 uϕ ) = P (g(E, L) 6 uϕ )
Z
=
fEL (ξ, η) dξ dη ,
D(uϕ )

(38)

8
where D(uϕ ) ⊂ R2 is the region of the EL plane over which g(E, L) 6 uϕ . Once the cumulative distribution function
FUϕ (uϕ ) is known, the probability density function fUϕ (uϕ ) can be finally obtained by means of the definitions of
FUϕ and fUϕ , i.e.
fUϕ (uϕ ) =

dFUϕ (uϕ )
.
duϕ

(39)

In contrast with the case of a single random variable, this procedure for obtaining fUϕ (uϕ ) is unlikely to be feasible
analytically, due to the complexity of both the function g and the domain of integration D. It can probably be done
numerically, though.
Following this approach, it should be possible to investigate the uncertainty on the orbit, described by a random
variable Uϕ , due to the uncertainties on the parameters E, L, U0 (and possibly others), and to compare this uncertainty
on the orbit to the one produced by an uncertainty of the central mass M . The basis of this approach is laid on two
key ingredients:
1. Finding the (analytical or numerical) solution of the equation of motion (13);
2. Computing the probability density function of the orbit, once the probability density functions of the parameters
are given, following the method described above.

IV.

MASS UNCERTAINTY AND NON-CIRCULAR ORBITS

In Section II B 2, solutions of the equation of motion (2) were reviewed, and qualitatively different kinds of orbit
have been identified. For these orbits, the effect of assuming the mass M as a normally distributed random variable
is now investigated for orbits with set initial conditions for the position and velocity. Let us first recall that we shall
be using the (dimensionful) variable u in Eq. (28), like in the previous Section, and that the orbits are divided into
the following four groups (u0 represents the initial position of the particle):
• If the third degree polynomial on the right-hand side of Eq. (27) has three distinct real roots (u1 < u2 < u3 ),
we can have the following behaviours:
– if 0 < u1 < u0 < u2 < u3 , the graph of u versus ϕ oscillates between u1 and u2 (first case);
– if 0 < u1 < u2 < u3 < u0 , the graph of u versus ϕ moves away from u3 towards infinity (second case);
– if u1 < 0 < u0 < u2 < u3 only part of an oscillation occurs, with the particle first approaching the central
mass and then moving away towards infinity (third case);
• If the polynomial has one real root and two complex conjugates roots, the particle falls into the black hole and
the orbit is a spiral with a finite change in ϕ (fourth case).
It is important to recall that, if the energy and the angular momentum of the particle are such that u1 < u2 = u3 ,
three behaviours are possible: the orbit may be circular at the radius rin ∼ 1/u2 = 1/u3 (the inner radius), or it may
spiral in asymptotically approaching the inner radius or spiral down from the inner radius to the central point. If
instead u1 = u2 < u3 , a circular orbit at the radius rout ∼ 1/u1 = 1/u2 (the outer radius) is also possible. In all of
these cases, after the slightest perturbation of the central mass M , we fall back in one of the four previous cases. For
example, when the stable orbit is perturbed, we fall in the first case.
In the following, we shall analyse the above four cases. For the purpose of making the results more readable, we
will first show plots of the orbits corresponding to fixed numerical values of the parameters of relevance for the each
distribution of the mass M , and specifically chosen for the purpose of displaying clearly the qualitative features of
the orbits in the case under consideration. We then display the chosen distribution for the mass M and the final
distribution of the quantity of relevance again for each specific case (e.g. amplitude of the oscillation, minimum
distance from the centre, etc). In particular, we shall use units with G = 1.

A.

First case

When the orbit oscillates between u1 and u2 , it is interesting to analyse the amplitude A (and the period) of the
oscillations as a function of the random variable M . For example, the trajectories r = r(ϕ) corresponding to three
different values of M are shown in Fig. 1 in polar form. Cartesian plots of u(ϕ) are shown in Fig. 2, together with

If the random variable M is normally distributed with mean value µM = 1.5 and standard deviation σM = 0.1, the
probability density function fA of the random variable A can be obtained by means of Eq. (37) once the probability
density function fM and the function A = g(M ) are known. The probability density functions fM and fA are shown
in Fig. 3.

B.

Second case

The second possibility listed above is that the particle will monotonically move towards the central mass (u → ∞),
as is shown by the polar trajectories r(ϕ) represented in Fig. 4. For such a type of orbits, the function u (ϕ) is plotted
for several values of M in Fig. 5. For this case, it is therefore interesting to analyse the behaviour of uϕ as a function
of M for different values of the angle ϕ that parameterizes the orbit.
If the random variable M is normally distributed with mean value µM = 1 and standard deviation σM = 0.05,
the resulting probability density function fU of the random variable uϕ , for some exemplary values of ϕ, is shown
in Fig. 6 along with the corresponding probability density function fM . As expected the variance of the probability
density function of uϕ increases with ϕ.

C.

Third case

Another type of solution is the one representing a particle coming from infinity towards the central mass and then
moving back towards infinity (r → ∞, i.e. u → 0). Some typical polar trajectories r(ϕ) of this kind are shown in
Fig. 7 and the corresponding function u(ϕ) are displayed in Fig. 8. The maximum value D of u reached along the
trajectory (proportional to the inverse of the minimum distance from the central mass) is also plotted as a function
of M .
If the random variable M is normally distributed with mean value µM = 1 and standard deviation σM = 0.2, the
probability density function fD of the random variable D is again obtained by means of Eq. (37). The probability
density functions fM and fD are shown in Fig. 9.

D.

Fourth case

The last type of solution is the one representing a particle with enough energy and sufficiently low angular momentum
which spirals into a black hole with a finite change in ϕ. Some examples of these orbits are shown in Fig. 10 and
the corresponding function u(ϕ) is plotted in Fig. 11, along with the behaviour of uϕ as a function of M for different
values of the angle ϕ.
For M normally distributed with mean value µM = 2.2 and standard deviation σM = 0.05, the resulting probability
density functions fU for some angles ϕ is shown in Fig. 12.

the particle velocity.

(48)

Focusing on the case γ = 1, and restricting ourselves, from now on, to the perturbation of circular orbits (u(0) = uc ),
we treat the massive and massless cases separately.
In the massive case (ε = 1), two circular orbits exist [see Eq. (7)]:
1. For the internal orbit we have rc = rin = r− in Eq. (7), that is
√
L2 + L4 − 12 G2 M 2 L2
,
uc = uin =
6 G2 M

(49)

for which αc = α > 0 [see Eq. (7)] and βc = uin . The analytical solution of Eq. (45) is then
u(1) =

√
βc
[cosh ( αc ϕ) − 1] ,
αc

(50)

and it is easy to see that, as expected, this orbit is unstable. In fact, the perturbed solution (43) to first order
reads


√
δM cosh ( α ϕ) − 1

(51)

from which we can see that increasing the mass (δM > 0) leads to r → 0 (u → ∞). On the other hand, reducing
the mass (δM < 0), leads to r → ∞ (u = 0) for some finite value of ϕ.
2. For the external orbit we have rc = rout = r+ in Eq. (7), or
√
L2 − L4 − 12 G2 M 2 L2
uc = uout =

6 G2 M
so that αc = −α < 0 and βc = uout . The analytical solution of Eq. (45) is now
p

which implies that the outer orbit is stable, with u(1) oscillating between 0 and 2 βc / |αc |. The perturbed solution
to first order is given by


√
δM 1 − cos ( α ϕ)

(54)

so that δM > 0 leads to periodic oscillations internal (u ≥ uout ) to the stable orbit r = rout , whereas δM < 0
leads to periodic oscillations external (u ≤ uout ) to the stable orbit r = rout . This is potentially quite interesting
in practical terms because the oscillations are proportional to the perturbation δM (assuming that the oscillations
are large enough to be detectable).
For the massless case (ε = 0), there is one possible circular orbit rc = rph in Eq. (6), or
uc = uph =

L2

3 G2 M

(55)

In this case Eq. (45) becomes
d2 u(1)

(56)

u(1) = uc [cosh(ϕ) − 1] .

(57)

and its analytical solution is

It is clear that, since u(1) → ∞ as ϕ → ∞, the orbit

is unstable, and it will fall into the singularity (u → ∞) if δM > 0 or escape to infinity (u → 0) if δM < 0.

with αc still given by Eq. (46). Moreover, the proper initial conditions are given by
u(1) (0) = δu0 ,

Similarly to the case of mass perturbations, we shall only consider circular orbits (u(0) = uc = u0 and δu0 ≡ δuc ) for
γ = 1 and distinguish the massive and massless cases.
In the massive case (ε = 1), we distinguish the internal and the external orbits:

As expected, the orbit is unstable,

We can now easily compare the effect of a perturbation in the initial position with the one produced by a perturbation
in the central mass by looking at Table I. It appears that the two effects are very similar, in fact, and in the following
we shall focus on the first case in the table.

Since the energy and the angular momentum of test particles moving on the internal circular orbits are connected
by the relation



3/2
E = 108 36 − L̃−1 L̃2 − 12
+ L̃ ,
(72)
the effects of a perturbation of the mass M can be determined by considering L as the only free parameter.
It is worth noticing that, in our analysis, an instantaneous reduction of the mass M , i.e. a perturbation δM < 0,
leads to a smaller radius for the circular orbit and to an increase of the corresponding potential V (see Fig. 13). After
the perturbation, the particle orbiting on the circular orbit would happen to have an energy lower than the potential
energy V . We shall therefore consider only perturbations δM > 0, i.e. instantaneous increases of the mass M . (Note
that in the analytical perturbation method, solutions are found under the condition du/dϕ(0) = 0, see Eq. (42) and
following comment.)
The change of the radial coordinate of the particle as a function of the angle ϕ following an instantaneous perturbation δM > 0 are shown in Fig. 14, Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 for three values of the angular momentum, namely
√
1. L̃ = 12, which is the minimum possible value for which the circular orbit exists. The radius of the circular
orbit in this case is r̃in = 6 (Fig. 14);
2. L̃ = 4, for which the radius of the circular orbit is r̃in = 4 (Fig. 15);
3. L̃ = 100, for which the radius of the circular orbit is r̃in ≈ 3.0009, close to the minimum possible value r̃in = 3
(Fig. 16).
For all the three cases analysed here, the radial position of the particle as a function of the number N of revolutions
(N = ϕ/2 π) is shown for several values of the perturbation δM/M , ranging from 10−5 to 10−1 . The results show
that the number of revolutions after which the particle decrease its radial coordinate by 5% of the original value is
always less than 2, and decreases as the perturbation increases or the angular momentum increases. For each of the
three cases, the polar representations of the orbits are shown for three selected values of the perturbation, namely
δM/M = 10−5 , 10−3 , 10−1 . The number of revolutions N after which the variation of the radial position of the
particle amounts to 5% of the initial value has then been systematically investigated for values of the perturbation
parameter δM/M varying between 10−6 and 10−1 . The result is shown in Fig. 17.
Let us next assume the perturbation δM > 0 is a random variable with distribution N∗ (µδM , σδM ), i.e. a random
variable with probability density function

Setting µδM = 0 and σδM = 0.0005, the corresponding random variable representing the number of revolutions N
after which the variation of the radial coordinate amounts to 5% of the initial value is shown in Fig. 18. The same
analysis for a ten times larger value of σδM = 0.005 is also shown in Fig. 19. The cumulative distribution functions
of the random variable N for the two cases σδM = 0.0005 and σδM = 0.005 are shown in Fig. 20.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

In this work we started to consider in detail the effects of uncertainties in the determination of the black hole mass
on geodesics, mainly motivated by studies of quantum aspects of black holes [23–27]. In particular, we analysed the
consequences of a randomly distributed mass on qualitatively different orbits and we were interested in the possible
differences between such effects and those simply stemming from the experimental uncertainties in the measurements
of masses and positions. It is in fact important to be able to tell apart the two sources of uncertainties if one eventually
wishes to look for experimental evidence of quantum gravity in black hole physics.
A comparison between the two kinds of uncertainties for circular orbits was considered in Section V, where we
showed that they appear functionally very similar, which points to the fact that it would be very difficult to identify
quantum effects from experimental data [31] about such orbits of test bodies obtained, for instance, by the Event
Horizon Telescope [32] and BlackHoleCam [33, 34]. In the search for more significant signatures of quantum effects,
beside considering more explicitly models of quantum black holes [11–14, 35–38], we also intend to study other effects
occurring on black hole space-times. In particular, it will be interesting to investigate the red-shift of signals emitted
by sources either falling towards the black hole along (perturbed and unperturbed geodesics) as well as following
perturbed unstable circular orbits. Given the precision with which the red-shift can be measured, this might be a
more promising route towards experimental quantum gravity.
