ABSTRACT

We investigate a possibility that a recently reported radio transient in M81,
VTC J095517.5+690813, is caused by an accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf.
It became bright in radio but no associated optical transient was discovered. The
accretion-induced collapse is predicted to be radio bright but optically faint, satisfying the observed property. We compare predicted radio emission from the accretioninduced collapse with that of VTC J095517.5+690813 and show that it can be reasonably explained by the accretion-induced collapse. Although it is difficult to firmly conclude that VTC J095517.5+690813 is an accretion-induced collapse, our study shows
that radio-bright transients without an optical counterpart could still be related to
stellar deaths.

INTRODUCTION

Time domain astronomy is a current frontier of astronomy.
The variable sky has long been investigated in optical but
transient surveys in non-optical wavelengths are growing recently (e.g., Mooley et al. 2016; Kasliwal et al. 2017). For
example, fast radio bursts (FRBs) that show luminosity variations in radio in the timescale of milliseconds clearly shows
that the sky is very dynamic in time in the non-optical wavelengths (Lorimer et al. 2007; Thornton et al. 2013).
Anderson et al. (2019) recently reported a radio transient discovered by their radio transient survey with
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The transient, named
VTC J095517.5+690813, was discovered in 6 GHz in M81
(3.6 Mpc). No optical transients in M81 were reported so
far at the location (Anderson et al. 2019). If bright optical
transients were accompanied, the modern transient surveys
such as ASAS-SN1 would have been discovered them because of its proximity. Therefore, VTC J095517.5+690813
was likely not associated with a bright optical transient. Xray observations at the transient location were conducted
before and after the discovery of VTC J095517.5+690813
but no X-ray source was found at the transient location,
either. The pre-transient images provided by the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST ) found two red giants at the location of VTC J095517.5+690813, which could be a chance

coincidence, and no luminous stars were present at the
location. Therefore, the origin of VTC J095517.5+690813
is not likely related to deaths of massive stars during
which optically-faint radio-bright transients may be generated (e.g., Kashiyama et al. 2018). The exact nature of
VTC J095517.5+690813 has not been clarified yet.
Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) is a theoreticallypredicted collapse of a white dwarf (WD) forming a neutron star (NS). If an O+Ne+Mg WD grows its mass close
to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, electron-capture reactions can be initiated at the center (e.g., Nomoto & Kondo
1991). The electron-degeneracy pressure supporting the
WD is suddenly lost due to the electron-capture reactions and the WD collapses until it becomes a NS (e.g.,
Woosley & Baron 1992). Because AIC results in a formation of a NS from a WD, it has been suggested that
young NSs in globular clusters and some millisecond pulsars are formed through AIC (e.g., Bailyn & Grindlay 1990;
Bhattacharya & van den Heuvel 1991; Tauris et al. 2013).
Identifying AIC is challenging. Numerical simulations of
AIC predicts little (∼ 0.0001 M ⊙ , Dessart et al. 2006, 2007)
or small (∼ 0.01 M ⊙ , Metzger et al. 2009; Darbha et al.
2010) amount of 56 Ni production and AIC is not likely
accompanied by bright optical transients (but see also
Piro & Thompson 2014). However, it has been suggested
that AIC can result in bright radio transients (e.g.,
Piro & Kulkarni 2013; Moriya 2016). Because the lack of the
optical counterpart as well as the faintness of the progenitor
found in VTC J095517.5+690813 are consistent with the ex-

METHOD

We consider the radio emission from AIC resulting from
the interaction between the forward shock and circumstellar matter (CSM) as in Moriya (2016). Relativistic electrons accelerated at the forward shock emits synchrotron
radiation that can be observed in radio. The spectral index
of VTC J095517.5+690813 is not well constrained but it
is consistent with that expected from synchrotron emission
(Anderson et al. 2019). The ejecta properties from AIC and
the CSM properties at AIC determine the radio properties
of AIC. In this section, we first summarize the predicted
ejecta and CSM properties of AIC. Then, we present our
radio emission model.

2.1
2.1.1

AIC properties
Ejecta properties

Ejecta from AIC are theoretically suggested to have several
different properties. We take three possible combinations of
ejecta mass (Mej ) and ejecta kinetic energy (Eej ) in this work
as summarized in Table 1.
The multi-dimensional explosion simulations of AIC
conducted by Dessart et al. (2006) found that the neutrinodriven explosions of AIC lead to Mej ∼ 0.001 M ⊙ and
Eej ∼ 1049 erg (Model A). A later work by the same
group (Dessart et al. 2007) which added the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect in the explosion simulations found
that the magnetic stress can significantly change the AIC
ejecta properties, i.e., Mej ∼ 0.1 M ⊙ and Eej ∼ 1051 erg
(Model B). In both cases, the amount of 56 Ni synthesized
during the AIC explosions (M56 Ni ) is only ∼ 0.0001 M ⊙ and,
therefore, no optical transients powered by the radioactive
decay are likely accompanied by AIC.
On the other hand, Metzger et al. (2009) and
Darbha et al. (2010) suggested that a 56 Ni-rich outflow with
Mej ∼ M56 Ni ∼ 0.01 M ⊙ may be ejected if a rapidly rotation WD causes AIC. An neutron-rich accretion disk can be
formed when the WD collapses. Although the disk is initially
neutron-rich, the neutrino emission from the collapsing WD
would make the proton-to-neutron ratio in the disk to be
about 1. Thus, the composition of the hot accretion disk becomes dominated by 56 Ni. The disk can be ejected thanks
to the viscous stress and the nuclear fusion energy. They extimate the typical ejecta velocity of ∼ 0.1c, where c is the
speed of light, and therefore Eej ∼ 1050 erg (Model C).

CSM properties

There are two major channels to cause AIC. One is through
the accretion onto an O+Ne+Mg WD by a non-degenerate
companion star (single-degenerate [SD] channel) and the
other is by a merger of two C+O WDs (double-degenerate
[DD] channel). The two channels predict different CSM
properties and we summarize them in this section.
When the mass of the O+Ne+Mg WD in the SD channel grows to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, the WD causes
AIC. The accretion rate to grow the WD mass is estimated
to be ∼ 10−7 − 10−5 M ⊙ yr−1 (e.g., Nomoto & Kondo 1991;
Nomoto et al. 2007; Shen & Bildsten 2007; Wang et al.
2017). The accretion is provided by the non-degenerate companion star by binary mass transfer process. Some material
is ejected from the binary system during the mass transfer
process that can form a CSM. If the mass-loss rate from
the system is MÛ loss and the CSM velocity is vCSM , the CSM
density ρCSM is expressed as
ρCSM (r) =

MÛ loss −2
r ,
4πvCSM

(1)

from the mass conservation. Following the convention, we
define 4π A⋆ = ( MÛ loss /vCSM )/(10−5 M ⊙ yr−1 /1000 km s−1 ) so
that the CSM density profile can be expressed as ρCSM (r) =
5 × 1011 A⋆r −2 (cgs unit). The CSM density is solely determined by A⋆ and we change A⋆ in our radio light-curve (LC)
modeling. As summarized in Moriya (2016), A⋆ ∼ 0.001 − 10
is predicted from the SD channel of AIC.
The other path to AIC is through a merger of two C+O
WDs (the DD chanel). During the merger of the WDs, one
WD can be tidally disrupted and the material from the disrupted WD can accrete onto the other WD (e.g., Dan et al.
2014; Shen 2015; Sato et al. 2016). As a result, the off-center
C burning can be ignited at the surface of the survived WD
and the C+O WD can be transformed to an O+Ne+Mg WD
as the burning front proceeds to the center. If the newlyformed O+Ne+Mg WD is more massive than the Chandrasekhar mass limit, the WD can collapse and cause AIC
when its central density becomes high enough after it cools
down (e.g., Yoon & Langer 2005). Because little mass loss is
expected from the WD binary and there is a time delay from
the merger to AIC, the CSM density around AIC from the
DD channel is not likely to be much different from the interstellar matter (ISM) density. Thus, we assume that the CSM
density around AIC from the DD channel is constant with
the canonical ISM density of around 1 cm−3 (Ferrière 2001).
We note, however, Schwab et al. (2016) recently showed that
the WD-WD merger product may inflate to form a giant star
having a large mass-loss rate. Although the large mass-loss
rate does not continue until the time of AIC, the CSM density may not be as low as that of ISM in this case. A shell-like
CSM may also exist in such a case.

AIC MODEL FOR VTC J095517.5+690813

We analyse VTC J095517.5+690813 in the context of AIC
in this section. The SD and DD channels have different CSM
density structure and we treat them separately.

where rsh is the forward shock radius, vsh is the forward
shock velocity, nrel is the number density of the accelerated
electrons, γν = (2πme cν/eB)0.5 is the Lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons with the characteristic frequency ν, γmin
is the minimum Lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons,
me is the electron mass, tsync,ν is the synchrotron cooling
timescale, e is the electron charge, and B is the magnetic
field strength. We assume γmin ∼ 1 because the typical shock
velocity is of the order of 0.1c. We also assume that the number density of electrons accelerated to the Lorentz factor of
γ is proportional to γ −p with p = 3. The synchrotron cooling
timescale tsync,ν is 6πme c/σT γν B 2 , where σT is the Thomson
scattering cross section.
A fraction εB of the shock kinetic energy is assumed
to be converted to the magnetic field energy and a fraction
εe is assumed to be used for the electron acceleration at
the shock in estimating the synchrotron luminosity. These
fractions are quite uncertain. Detailed analysis of radio and
X-ray emission from SN shocks show that εB ∼ 0.01 − 0.001
and εe ∼ 0.1 (e.g., Björnsson & Fransson 2004; Maeda 2012;
Kamble et al. 2016). We here assume εB = 0.01 and εe = 0.1.
The synchrotron emission formulated above is altered
by absorption processes. The major absorption process is the
synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) at the shock (Chevalier
1998), because the CSM density of our interest is low enough
to neglect the free-free absorption by the unshocked CSM.
The SSA optical depth of τSSA = (ν/νSSA )−(p+4)/2 is adopted,
where νSSA ≃ 3 × 105 (rsh ǫe /ǫB )2/7 B 9/7 Hz in the cgs unit for
p = 3.
Finally, the forward shock properties (rsh and vsh ) are
derived by using the self-similar solution of Chevalier (1982).
For this purpose, the AIC ejecta are assumed to have the
double power-law density profile (∝ r −n outside and ∝ r −δ
inside) with n = 10 and δ = 1 as in supernova ejecta from
compact progenitors (Matzner & McKee 1999).

SD channel

The CSM around AIC from the SD channel has the density structure of ρCSM (r) = 5 × 1011 A⋆r −2 (cgs unit). Fig. 1
shows the synthetic radio (6 GHz) LCs of AIC from the SD
channel with different A⋆ and compares them with the radio LC of VTC J095517.5+690813 observed at 6 GHz. The
synthetic radio LCs first show a rapid rise time of less than
10 days, which corresponds to the time in which the SSA
optical depth becomes unity at 6 GHz. Then the synthetic
radio LCs decline following the density decline in CSM. The
radio LC of VTC J095517.5+690813 is consistent with the
radio luminosity evolution of AIC at the declining phase
with A⋆ ≃ 0.01 − 0.1.
The required CSM density A⋆ ≃ 0.01 − 0.1 is relatively
low. The low CSM density of A⋆ . 0.1 is expected in the
SD system with a stable nuclear burning phase with a mainsequence or He star companion. If red giants are companion,
the slow expected wind velocity (∼ 10 km s−1 ) makes the

discovered at the location of VTC J095517.5+690813 in HST
pre-transient images are not likely a donor star leading a
WD to AIC. This is also consistent with the lack of optical
transients, because it is suggested that AIC led by extended
donors can become bright in optical even if little 56 Ni is
produced (Piro & Thompson 2014). Several studies suggest

DD channel

The CSM around AIC from the DD channel is expected to
have a constant density similar to the ISM density (but see
also Schwab et al. 2016). Fig. 2 shows our synthetic radio LC
models in the case of the constant CSM density and compares them with that of VTC J095517.5+690813 in 6 GHz.
Contrary to the SD channel case, the radio LCs keep increasing. This is because the CSM density is constant and
also the SSA is not effective here because of the low CSM
density. The radio luminosity keeps increasing as the shock
propagates outward during the epochs shown in Fig. 2.
As presented in Fig. 2, the DD channel models can
also provide a good match to VTC J095517.5+690813.
The CSM density to account for VTC J095517.5+690813
varies significantly depending on the assumed ejecta properties. For Model A, a high ISM density of around
70 cm−3 is required to account for the luminosity of
VTC J095517.5+690813. In Model B, about 7 cm−3 is required to explain VTC J095517.5+690813 and the estimated
density is consistent with that of ISM. Model C requires a
rather large CSM density of around 20 cm−3 . Overall, the
radio LC of VTC J095517.5+690813 can be explained by
AIC from the DD channel, but the MHD-driven explosion
ejecta model (Model B) is preferred because of its low CSM
density.

that the He star donor channel could be a major path leading
to AIC (e.g., Wang et al. 2017; Wang 2018; Brooks et al.
2017; Ruiter et al. 2019). The He star donor channel for AIC
experience the optically-thick wind phase in which A⋆ & 0.1
is expected (Wang et al. 2017) but some systems can come
down to the stable burning phase before AIC (Wang 2018).

We have shown that the radio LC of VTC J095517.5+690813
is consistent with the synthetic radio LCs of AIC. However,
it is difficult to firmly conclude that VTC J095517.5+690813
is indeed an AIC. This is partly because of the limited LC
information available for VTC J095517.5+690813. A longer
monitoring of the radio LC evolution is required to identify
radio transients from AIC conclusively.
Despite of the expected optical faintness, the multiwavelength follow-up of radio transients would be important to identify AIC. The forward shock as well as the
possible pulsar wind nebula formation can make AIC not
only bright in radio but also in X-ray (Yu et al. 2019).
VTC J095517.5+690813 was observed in X-ray but no Xray emission was discovered at the location (Anderson et al.
2019). An issue is that the X-ray observations were performed more than 1 years after the radio bright phase and
the X-ray luminosity at these late phases might be low
(Yu et al. 2019). Immediate follow-up of radio transients
would be helpful to identify their nature.
AIC has been suggested to be a progenitor of FRBs
(Margalit et al. 2019). Thus the AIC might be first found
as an FRB and an optically-faint radio-bright transient may
follow.
Once identified as AIC, our study shows that it is possible to distinguish the evolutionary channel (SD or DD)
through the radio LCs, because the two channels predict
completely different radio LC evolution as shown in Figs. 1
and 2.

sequence or He star and the nuclear burning should be stable
at the time of AIC. The red giants located at the transient
location identified by HST are not likely a donor star. If
VTC J095517.5+690813 is an AIC from the DD channel, a
relatively high CSM density (10−100 cm−3 ) is required to explain the radio luminosity. VTC J095517.5+690813 was not
accompanied by an optical transient as predicted for AIC.
Although we find that VTC J095517.5+690813 can be
explained by AIC, it is hard to firmly conclude that it
is an AIC. To assess the nature of radio transients, longterm radio transient surveys as well as simultaneous multiwavelength (including optical and X-ray) transient surveys
would be essential.

43.78+59.3 in M82

Anderson et al. (2019) argue that 43.78+59.3, which is
a radio transient appeared in M82 (Muxlow et al. 2010;
Joseph et al. 2011; Gendre et al. 2013), might have similarity to VTC J095517.5+690813. We here compare our AIC
radio LC models with the LC of 43.78+59.3 (Fig. 3). Although the distance to M82 is not well determined, we here
assume 3.7 Mpc (Marion et al. 2015). We take the 5 GHz
LC of 43.78+59.3 presented in Gendre et al. (2013) for the
comparison.
Fig. 3 shows the comparison between the synthetic AIC
radio LC and that of 43.78+59.3. After the quick luminosity increase from the non-detection, 43.78+59.3 had an almost constant luminosity for 600 days. Such a long-term
constant luminosity is not expected in AIC from the SD
channel (Fig. 1) and we only show models from the DD
channel in Fig. 3. Although AIC from the DD channel can
have a slower luminosity evolution than that from the SD
channel, the LC evolution of 43.78+59.3, especially the initial rapid LC rise followed by the constant luminosity, is not
consistent with our AIC radio emission models. Thus, we
conclude that 43.78+59.3 is not likely an AIC and has a different origin (e.g., Joseph et al. 2011). The long-term LC of
43.78+59.3 enable us to exclude the AIC model. A similar
long-term monitoring of VTC J095517.5+690813 is required
to confirm or exclude our AIC model.

CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the possibility that the recently discovered radio transient in M81, VTC J095517.5+690813, is
a result of AIC. We showed that the radio properties of
VTC J095517.5+690813 are consistent with those expected
to be accompained by AIC. If VTC J095517.5+690813 is
an AIC from the SD channel, the CSM density required
to account for VTC J095517.5+690813 is relatively low
(A⋆ ≃ 0.01 − 0.1). Thus, the donor star should be a mainMNRAS 000, 1–6 (2019)
