We report on high-pressure (pmax = 2.1 GPa) muon spin rotation experiments probing the
temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth λ (T ) in the layered superconductor 2H-NbSe2 .
Upon increasing the pressure, we observe a substantial increase of the superfluid density ns /m∗ ∝
1/λ2 , which we find to scale linearly with Tc . This linear scaling is considered a hallmark feature
of unconventional superconductivity, especially in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Our
current results, along with our earlier findings on 1T’-MoTe2 (Z. Guguchia et. al., Nature Communications 8, 1082 (2017)), demonstrate that this linear relation is also an intrinsic property of the
superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides, whereas the ratio Tc /TF is approximately a
factor of 20 lower than the ratio observed in hole-doped cuprates. We, furthermore, find that the
values of the superconducting gaps are insensitive to the suppression of the quasi-two-dimensional
CDW state, indicating that the CDW ordering and the superconductivity in 2H-NbSe2 are independent of each other.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class
of layered materials, which presently attract great
interest because of their versatile physical, chemical,
and mechanical properties[1–11]. The TMDs share the
MX2 formula, with M being a transition metal (M =
Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W or Re) and X being
a chalcogen (X = S, Se, or Te). These compounds
crystallize in different structural phases resulting from
different stacking of the individual MX2 layers, with van
der Waals bonding between them.
A variety of novel physical phenomena have been
reported in TMDs systems. Most recently topological
physics with Dirac-type dispersion, exotic optical and
transport behavior originating from valley splitting
were predicted and observed [1, 4]. Correlated physics
has been studied intensively especially in 2H-TaS2 ,
2H-NbSe2 , and more recently in 1T’-MoTe2 [5, 12–15].
2H-NbSe2 is a superconductor with a critical temperature Tc ≈ 7.3 K, and hosts a two-dimensional charge
density wave (CDW) with a critical temperature of
TCDW ≈ 33 K [16–21]. The superconducting transition
temperature of 2H-NbSe2 is remarkably high in comparison with other TMDs, where commonly transition
temperatures below 4 K are observed. Recently, it was
found that both the superconducting state, as well as
the CDW ordering remain intact even for a single layer
of this material [8]. The superconducting transition

temperature is thereby lowered in the 2D limit to Tc ≈
1.1 K. Previously, the effect of hydrostatic pressure on
the CDW ordering and superconductivity were studied
in 2H-NbSe2 by means of magnetization and resistivity
measurements [22, 23]. It was found that upon increasing
pressures, CDW ordering is suppressed. The suppression
of charge-density wave ordering commonly causes a
strong increase of the superconducting transition temperature Tc (see, e.g. references [24–26]). The generic
occurrence of a “fragile“ SC phase in the systems with
competing SC and CDW ground states was reported,
recently [27]. In 2H-NbSe2 , Tc increases only slightly
(∆Tc < 1 K) with increasing pressure without any
anomaly across the critical pressure at which the CDW
state disappears. Moreover, both CDW order parameter
amplitude as well as its static phase coherence length are
unaffected when the superconductivity is suppressed in a
high magnetic field [18]. Recent X-ray experiments also
suggest that different phonon branches are responsible
for SC and CDW orders [23]. These findings suggested
that superconductivity is only weakly affected by the
suppression of the CDW ordering [18–21, 23].
Layered superconductors, with highly anisotropic
electronic properties have been found to be potential
hosts for unconventional superconductivity. The most
prominent example are the cuprates, consisting of CuO2
layers and the iron pnictides superconductors, with
tetrahedra coordinated FePn4 layers. Other examples
for unconventional superconductivity in layered systems
are a monolayer of FeSe on STO [28] and the reported
superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene [29].

Recently, we have reported on muon spin rotation (µSR)
measurements on the TMD superconductor Td -MoTe2 ,
which is considered to be a type-II Weyl semimetal
[10, 11, 30]. We had found a linear scaling of superfluid
density at T = 0 and the transition temperature Tc ,
similar to the relation found earlier in the cuprates [31]
and other Fe-based superconductors [32–34].
Here, we report on the substantial increase of the superfluid density ns /m∗ in van der Waals system 2HNbSe2 (1(a)) under hydrostatic pressure, which seems
not to be correlate with the suppression of CDW ordered state. We find the superfluid density in 2H-NbSe2
to scale linearly with Tc . These results in combination

to our previous results on MoTe2 [30] indicate that this
linear relation has general validity for transition metal
dichalcogenide superconductors. This relation is considered to be a hallmark feature of unconventional superconductivity [31, 35, 36] in cuprate and iron-pnictides
superconductors. Our findings, therefore, pose a challenge for understanding the underlying quantum physics
in these layered TMDs and might lead to a better understanding of generic aspects of non-BCS behaviors in
unconventional superconductors.
In figure 1(b), we show the schematic phase diagram of
the pressure dependence of the CDW transition temperature TCDW and the superconducting transition temperature Tc for NbSe2 , according to reference [5]). The red

Here, γµ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon, and Φ0 is

arrows mark the pressures at which the T -dependence
of the penetration depth and the superfluid density was
measured. As it can be seen, the CDW transition is
strongly reduced within the here investigated pressure
range between p = 0 to 2.2 GPa. In figures 1(c) and
(d), two representative the transverse-field (TF) µSRtime spectra for 2H-NbSe2 at ambient pressure and at the
maximaum applied pressure of p = 2.2 GPa are shown.
Both measurements were performed in the pressure cell,
with the constant background distracted. For both pressures, the transverse-field (TF) muon time spectra in a
field of µ0 H = 70 mT are shown above (T = 10 K) and
below (T = 0.25 K) the superconducting transition temperature Tc . Above Tc the oscillations show a small relaxation due to the random local fields from the nuclear
magnetic moments. Below Tc the relaxation rate strongly
increases with decreasing temperature due to the presence of a nonuniform local magnetic field distribution as
a result of the formation of a flux-line lattice (FLL) in
the Shubnikov phase.
From the obtained TF muon time spectra, we have derived the temperature dependence of the muon spin depolarization rate σsc , which is proportional to the second
moment of the field distribution (see Method section).
In figure 2, we show the temperature dependence of the
muon spin depolarization rate σsc of NbSe2 in the superconducting state at pressures of p = 0, 0.4, 0.7, 1.4,
and 2.2 GPa. Below Tc the relaxation rate σsc starts to
increase from zero with decreasing temperature due to
the formation of the FLL. We find the increase of the
superconducting transition temperature Tc to be in good
agreement with earlier reports [22, 23]. Furthermore, we
observed a substantial increase of the low-temperature
value of the muon spin depolarization rate σsc with increasing pressure. This can be seen most clearly at base
temperature, where the muon spin depolarization rate
σsc (T = 0.25 K) increases by almost ∼ 30 % from p =
0 GPa to p = 2.2 GPa. Interestingly, at all pressures
the form of the temperature dependence of σsc , which
reflects the topology of the SC gap, shows the saturation at low temperatures, indicating the presence of the
isotropic pairing in NbSe2 at all applied pressure.
The second moment of the resulting inhomogeneous
field distribution is related to the magnetic penetration
2
∝ λ−4 , whereas σsc is the Gausdepth λ as ∆B 2 ∝ σsc
sian relaxation rate due to the formation of FLL [37].
In order to investigate the symmetry of the superconducting gap, we have therefore derived the temperaturedependent London magnetic penetration depth λ(T ),
which is related to the relaxation rate by:

exponentially.
To proceed with a quantitative analysis, we consider
the local (London) approximation (λ  ξ, where ξ is
the coherence length) and employ the empirical α-model.
The model, widely used in previous investigations of the
penetration depth of multi-band superconductors [38–
42], assumes that the gaps occuring in different bands,
besides a common Tc , are independent of each other. The
superfluid density is calculated for each component separately [38] and added together with a weighting factor.
For our purposes, a two-band model suffices, yielding:

Here λ(0) is the London magnetic penetration depth at
zero temperature, ∆0,i is the value of the i-th SC gap
(i = 1, 2) at T = 0 K, and ωi is the weighting factor,
which measures their relative contributions to λ−2 (i.e.
ω1 + ω2 = 1).
The results of this analysis are presented in Fig. 3a,
where the temperature dependence of λ−2 for NbSe2 is
plotted at pressures of p = 0, 0.4, 0.7, 1.4, and 2.2 GPa.
The dashed and the solid lines for ambient pressure
results represent fits for the temperature-dependent
London magnetic penetration at ambient pressure using
a s-wave and a s + s-wave model, respectively [30].
As it can be seen, the s + s-wave provides a much
better description of the data, thereby ruling out a out
the simple s-wave model as an adequate description of
λ−2 (T ) for 2H-NbSe2 . The two gap s + s-wave scenario

' 183 nm [48]. No estimates are currently available for
l under pressure. However, the in-plane l is most probably independent of pressure, considering the fact that
the effect of compression is mostly interlayered, i.e., the
intralayer Nb-Se bond length remains nearly unchanged
(especially in the here investigated pressure region).[22]
This very small effect of compression can be attributed to
the unique anisotropy resulting from the stacking of layers with van der Waals type interactions between them.
Thus, in view of the short coherence length and relatively
large l, we can reliably assume that NbSe2 lies close to
the clean limit [30, 49]. With this assumption, we obtain the ground-state value ns /(m∗ /me ) ' 5.7 × 1027
m−3 , and 7.5 × 1027 m−3 for p = 0 GPa, and 2.2 GPa
respectively.

the experimental data remarkably well. The presence
of two isotopic gaps and their values are in very good
agreement with previous results [43–47]. According
to ARPES data several independent electronic bands
(four Nb-derived bands with roughly cylindrical Fermi
surfaces, centered at the Γ and K points and one
Se-derived bands with a small ellipsoid pocket around
the Γ point) cross the Fermi surface in NbSe2 , two-gap
superconductivity can be understood by assuming that
the SC gaps open at two distinct types of bands. We find
that two gap s + s-wave superconductivity is preserved
up to the highest applied pressure of p = 2.2 GPa. All
the s + s-wave fits for all pressures are shown in figure
3(c). Furthermore, the pressure dependence of all the
parameters extracted from the data analysis within
the α model are plotted in Figs. 3(b,c). The critical
temperature Tc increases with pressure only by ∼ 0.7
K at the maximum applied pressure of p = 2.2 GPa, as
shown in Fig. 3b. We, however, observe a substantial
increase of the superfluid density λ−2 with increasing
pressures, as shown in figure 3(b). At the maximum
applied pressure of p = 2.2 GPa the increase of λ−2
is ∆p ≈ 31.4(8) % compared to the value at ambient
pressure. The absolute size of the small gap ∆1 ' 0.5(3)
meV and the large gap ∆2 ' 1.25(5) meV remain nearly
unchanged by pressure, as shown in figure 3(c).

5
λ−2 (0) ∝ ns /(m∗ /me ) in 2H-NbSe2 under pressure, as
discussed above, is an essential finding of this paper.
It should be noted that the impairment of the chargedensity wave ordering, and the associated lowering of
the charge-density wave ordering transition TCDW under
pressure may cause the restoring of some electronic
density of states at the Fermi surface. However, the
electron and hole states that condense into the CDW
ordered state comprise only ≈ 1 % of the total density
of states at the Fermi surface in 2H-NbSe2 [50–52]. The
expected maximal increase of the total density of states
caused by a complete suppression of the charge-density
wave would be ∆D(EF ) ≈ 1 %, which cannot solely
attribute for the the observed ∼ 30 % enhancement of
the superfluid density in 2H-NbSe2 . Thus, the large
pressure effect on ns /(m∗ /me ) has a more complex
origin. We also observed that both superconducting
gaps ∆1 and ∆2 are nearly pressure independent up to
a pressure of p = 2.2 GPa (figure 3(c)), while the CDW
transition temperature is largely reduced in this pressure
range p = 0 - 2.2 GPa [22, 23]. This implies that the
gap values are insensitive to the suppression of the
CDW state. This observation strongly supports the idea
that superconducting and CDW orders are somewhat
isolated from each other and that CDW pairing have
only minimal effect on superconductivity in 2H-NbSe2
[23]. Furthermore, we find the superfluid density in
2H-NbSe2 to scale linearly with Tc , as shown in figure 4,
which is not expected within BCS theory. Remarkably,
the ratio between the superfluid density and the critical
temperature Tc in 2H-NbSe2 is nearly the same as for
the TMD superconductor 1T’-MoTe2 [30], indicating a
common mechanism and related electronic origin for the
superconductivity.
The nearly linear relationship between Tc and the
superfluid density was originally observed in hole-doped
cuprates [31, 35], where the ratio between Tc and their
effective Fermi temperature TF being about Tc / TF
∼ 0.05, which means about 4-5 times reduction of Tc
from the ideal Bose Condensation temperature for a
non-interacting Bose gas. These results were discussed in
terms of the crossover from Bose Einstein Condensation
to BCS-like condensation [53–55]. Within the picture
of BEC to BCS crossover, systems exhibiting small
Tc /TF (large TF ) are considered to be in the BCS-like
side, while the linear relationship between Tc and TF is
expected only in the BEC-like side. This relationship
has in the past been used for the characterization of
BCS-like, so-called conventional and BEC-like, so-called
unconventional superconductors. The here present results on 2H-NbSe2 together with our previously reported
results on 1T’-MoTe2 demonstrate that a linear relation
between Tc and the superfluid density holds for these
TMDs systems. However, we find the ratio Tc /TF to
be reduced further by a factor of ∼ 20. These systems
fall into the clean limit, therefore, the linear relation is
unrelated to pair breaking, and can be regarded to hold

between Tc and ns /m∗ . It should be noticed that the
widely studied layered superconductor MgB2 , that has a
layered structure, consisting of hexagonal boron layered,
exhibits a ratio Tc /TF [56], which is almost identical to
the value found here for the TMDs. This implies that
the BEC-like linear relationship may exist in systems
with Tc /TF reduced even by a factor of 20 from the ratio
in hole doped cuprates.

In refs [54, 55, 57], one of the present authors pointed
out that there seem to exist at least two factors which
determine Tc in unconventional superconductors: one is
the superfluid density and the other is the closeness to
the competing state. The second factor can be seen in
the energy of the magnetic resonance mode, which represents the difference in free energy between the superconducting state and the competing magnetically ordered
state. In the case of hole-doped cuprates, the competing state is characterized by antiferromagnetic order, but
frustrated by the introduction of doped holes. In the case
of electron-doped cuprates, the competing state develops
in antiferromagnetic network diluted by the doped carriers. In the case of present TMDC systems, the competing
state comes from charge density waves. These systematic
difference of competing states might be related to the
three different ratios of Tc /TF seen in the three different
families of superconductors shown in Fig. 4.
In conclusion, we provide the first microscopic investigation of the superconductivity under hydrostatic pressure in the layered superconductor 2H-NbSe2 . Specifically, the zero-temperature magnetic penetration depth
λef f (0) and the temperature dependence of λ−2
ef f were
studied in 2H-NbSe2 by means of µSR experiments as a
function of pressure up to p' 2.2 GPa. The superfluid
densities at all pressures are best described by a two gap
s + s-wave scenario. We find that the application of
pressure causes a substantial increase of the superfluid
density ns /m∗ . Moreover, we show that the superfluid
density in 2H-NbSe2 scales linearly with Tc , this behavior
was previously attributed to unconventional superconductors. Our current results, in combination with previous results on 1T’-MoTe2 [30] demonstrate that a linear
relation holds for these transition metal dichalcogenide
superconductors but with a ratio Tc /TF , which is reduced
by a factor of 20 from the ratio in hole doped cuprates.
This implies that the superfluid density of TMDs is about
an order of magnitude higher than that in the cuprates
with respect to their critical temperatures Tc . We also
find that the values of the superconducting gaps are insensitive to the suppression of the CDW ordered state,
indicating that CDW pairing has only a minimal effect
on the superconductivity in 2H-NbSe2 . These results hint
towards a common mechanism and electronic origin for
superconductivity in TMDs, which might have far reaching consequences for the future development of devices
based on these materials.

METHODS

Sample preparation: Single-phase polycrystalline
samples of 2H-NbSe2 were prepared by means of
high-temperature solid-state synthesis. Stoichiometric
amounts of niobium powder (99.99 %) and selenium
shots (99.999 %) were mixed and heated in a sealed
quartz tube, under an inert atmosphere, at 750 ◦ C for 3
days. In order to ensure high homogeneity, the samples
were ground, pressed to a pellet, and reheated in a
sealed quartz tube under an inert atmosphere at 750
◦
C for another 5 days. Eventually, the samples were
quenched in water to ensure no selenium loss.
Pressure cell: Pressures up to 2.2 GPa were generated in a double wall piston-cylinder type of cell
made of CuBe material, especially designed to perform
µSR experiments under pressure [59–62]. As a pressure
transmitting medium Daphne oil was used. The pressure
was measured by tracking the SC transition of a very
small indium plate by AC susceptibility. The filling
factor of the pressure cell was maximized. The fraction
of the muons stopping in the sample was approximately
40 %.
µSR experiment:
In a µSR experiment nearly 100 % spin-polarized
muons µ+ are implanted into the sample one at a time
[63]. The positively charged µ+ thermalize at interstitial
lattice sites, where they act as magnetic microprobes. In
a magnetic material the muon spin precesses in the local
field Bµ at the muon site with the Larmor frequency νµ
= γµ /(2π)Bµ (muon gyromagnetic ratio γµ /(2π) = 135.5
MHz T−1 ). Using the µSR technique important length
scales of superconductors can be measured, namely the
magnetic penetration depth λ and the coherence length
ξ. If a type II superconductor is cooled below Tc in an applied magnetic field ranged between the lower (Hc1 ) and
the upper (Hc2 ) critical fields, a vortex lattice is formed
which in general is incommensurate with the crystal lattice with vortex cores separated by much larger distances
than those of the unit cell. Because the implanted muons
stop at given crystallographic sites, they will randomly
probe the field distribution of the vortex lattice. Such
measurements need to be performed in a field applied
perpendicular to the initial muon spin polarization (so
called TF configuration).
µSR experiments under pressure were performed
at the µE1 beamline of the Paul Scherrer Institute
(Villigen, Switzerland, where an intense high-energy (pµ
= 100 MeV/c) beam of muons is implanted in the sample
through the pressure cell. The low background GPS
(πM3 beamline) and low-temperature LTF instruments
were used to study the single crystalline as well as the
polycrystalline samples of MoTe2 at ambient pressure.
Analysis of TF-µSR data:
The TF µSR data were analyzed by using the following

functional form:[39]

Here As and Apc denote the initial assymmetries
of the sample and the pressure cell, respectively.
γ/(2π) ' 135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio,
ϕ is the initial phase of the muon-spin ensemble and
Bint represents the internal magnetic field at the muon
site. The relaxation rates σsc and σnm characterize the
damping due to the formation of the FLL in the SC
state and of the nuclear magnetic dipolar contribution,
respectively. In the analysis σnm was assumed to be
constant over the entire temperature range and was
fixed to the value obtained above Tc where only nuclear
magnetic moments contribute to the muon depolarization rate σ. The Gaussian relaxation rate, σpc , reflects
the depolarization due to the nuclear moments of the
pressure cell. The width of the pressure cell signal
increases below Tc . As shown previously [61], this is due
to the influence of the diamagnetic moment of the SC
sample on the pressure cell, leading to the temperature
dependent σpc below Tc . In order to consider this
influence we assume the linear coupling between σpc and
the field shift of the internal magnetic field in the SC
state:
σpc (T ) = σpc (T > Tc ) + C(T )(µ0 Hint,NS - µ0 Hint,SC ),
where σpc (T > Tc ) = 0.25 µs−1 is the temperature
independent Gaussian relaxation rate. µ0 Hint,NS and
µ0 Hint,SC are the internal magnetic fields measured
in the normal and in the SC state, respectively. As
indicated by the solid lines in Figs. 2b,c the µSR data
are well described by Eq. (1). The good agreement
between the fits and the data demonstrates that the
model used describes the data rather well.
Analysis of λ(T ):
λ(T ) was calculated within the local (London) approximation (λ  ξ) by the following expression [39, 40]:

where f = [1 + exp(E/kB T )]−1 is the Fermi function, ϕ is the angle along the Fermi surface, and
∆i (T, ϕ) = ∆0,i Γ(T /Tc )g(ϕ) (∆0,i is the maximum
gap value at T = 0).
The temperature dependence of the gap is approximated by the expression
Γ(T /Tc ) = tanh {1.82[1.018(Tc /T − 1)]0.51 },[41] while
g(ϕ) describes the angular dependence of the gap and
it is replaced by 1 for both an s-wave and an s+s-wave
gap, and | cos(2ϕ)| for a d-wave gap.
