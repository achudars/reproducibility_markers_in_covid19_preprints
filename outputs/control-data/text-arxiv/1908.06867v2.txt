Abstract. Let A be a finite group acting by automorphisms on the finite
group G. We introduce the commuting graph Γ(G, A) of this action and study
some questions related to the structure of G under certain graph theoretical
conditions on Γ(G, A).

1. introduction
Throughout the article all groups are finite. There have been a lot of research
to investigate the effect of the commutativity relation on the structure of a group.
In [1] the noncommuting graph of a group G was introduced as the simple graph
with the vertex set G \ Z(G) where two distinct vertices x and y forming an edge
{x, y} if and only if they do not commute. This is the complementary graph of the
so called commuting graph of G. The graph theoretical invariants of such graphs
and also the characterization of groups with a given commuting or noncommuting
graph have been studied extensively by various authors (e.g [1], [4], [14], [13], [12]).
In the present paper we introduce a generalization of these graphs, namely we
define the commuting graph of A-orbits on G as follows:
Definition 1.1. Let A be a group acting by automorphisms on the group G. The
commuting graph Γ(G, A) of this action is the graph with vertex set V (Γ(G, A)) =
{xA : x ∈ G \ {1}}, the set of all A-orbits on G \ {1}, where two distinct vertices
O and O′ are joined by an edge (written O ∼ O′ ) if and only if there exist x ∈ O
and y ∈ O′ such that xy = yx.
Clearly we have Γ(G, A) = Γ(G, A/CA (G)). In case A is trivial, Γ(G, A) is the
commuting graph of G as we define it, while the standard commuting graph of G is
the induced subgraph of Γ(G, {1}) on the subset G\Z(G) of the vertex set G \ {1}.
If A is equal to the group of inner automorphisms of G, then Γ(G, A) is exactly the
commuting graph of nontrivial conjugacy classes of G introduced by Herzog et al.
in [8].
Let (V, E) be a simple graph. For any partition V = {V1 , V2 , . . . , Vr , . . .} of V
one can define a new graph (V , E), which we call the quotient graph modulo V ,
where {Vi , Vj } is an edge in E if and only if there exist x ∈ Vi and y ∈ Vj such
that {x, y} is an edge in E. This method of constructing a new graph from a
given graph can be used to explain the relation between several graphs associated
to a group. For example if one consider the commuting graph of a group G as
the simple graph Γ(G) = (V, E) with vertex set V = G\ {1} where two distinct

vertices g and h form and edge if and only
 if gh = hg then Γ(G, A) is by definition
the quotient graph modulo the partition xA : x ∈ G\ {1} of V. More generally if
A ≤ B ≤ AutG then Γ(G, B) is the quotient of Γ(G, A) modulo the partition of
V (Γ(G, B)) of V (Γ(G, A)) as the B-orbit xB is a union of some A-orbits for any
x ∈ G\ {1} .
There is another graph associated to a given group G, namely the GrünbergKegel graph (the prime graph) of G denoted by GK(G) the vertex set of which is
the set π(G) of prime divisors of the order of G where two distinct vertices p and
q are joined by an edge if G contains an element of order pq. Since there exists an
element in G of order pq if and only if there are elements x and y in G of orders
p and q respectively, such that xy = yx, the Grünberg-Kegel graph carries a lot of
information related to the relation of commutativity and hence is closely related to
Γ(G, A). Let V0 denote the set of A-orbits of elements of prime order in the group
G and let Γ = (V0 , E0 ) be the subgraph induced from Γ(G, A) on V0 . It should be
noted that the quotient graph (V 0 , E 0 ) modulo the partition V 0 = {Vp : p ∈ π(G)},
where Vp is the set of A-orbits in G of elements of order p, is isomorphic to GK(G).
This first work on the commuting graph associated to a group action is essentially
devoted to the study of some questions related to the structure of G under certain
graph theoretical conditions on Γ(G, A). In Section 2 we study the connectedness
of Γ(G, A) when G is solvable. In Section 3 we investigate the case where Γ(G, A)
contains a complete vertex, that is, a vertex z A which is adjacent to every other
vertex. As a dual concept, in Section 4, we consider the case where Γ(G, A) contains
an isolated vertex. And finally in the last section we handle triangle free commuting
graphs of A-orbits.
2. connectedness
In this section we study the connectedness of Γ(G, A) if G is a solvable group.
Lemma 2.1. (i) Let B ≤ A. If Γ(G, B) is connected of diameter d then Γ(G, A)
is connected of diameter at most d.
(ii) If Γ(G, B) has m connected components then Γ(G, A) has at most m connected
components.
Proof. This follows from the fact that xB ∼ y B implies xA ∼ y A .



Theorem 2.2. Suppose that G is a solvable group. Then
(i) Γ(G, A) is disconnected if and only if G is Frobenius or 2-Frobenius. In any case,
the number of connected components of Γ(G, A) is m + 1 where m is the number of
A-orbits on the set of Frobenius complements of lower Frobenius subgroup.
(ii) If Γ(G, A) is connected then it is of diameter at most 8.
Proof. (i) Suppose that G is either Frobenius or 2-Frobenius. In the former case
G = KL where K ⊳ G and L acts semiregularly on K. In the latter case G = KLM
where K ⊳ G and KL ⊳ G such that the groups KL and LM are both Frobenius.
In any case CG (x) ≤ L for every x ∈ L. Let y ∈ K. Suppose that there is a
path joining xA and y A , that is there are x = x1 , . . . , xm = y in G such that
A
A

xA
1 ∼ x2 ∼ · · · ∼ xm = y . Notice that x1 ∼ x2 implies [x1 , x2 ] = 1 for some
a
a ∈ A and hence x2 ∈ L. It follows that x2 lies in an A-conjugate of L. Similarly
one can see that for every i = 1, . . . , m, xi belongs to an A-conjugate of L, which
contradicts the fact that y = xm ∈ K. Therefore Γ(G, A) is disconnected in case
where G is Frobenius or 2-Frobenius.

Conversely assume that Γ(G, A) is disconnected. Then so is Γ(G, {1}) by Lemma
2.1. It follows that Z(G) = 1 and so Γ(G, {1}) coincides with the commuting graph
of G. By [13] it is known that such a group G is Frobenius or 2-Frobenius.
Suppose now that Γ(G, A) is disconnected. If G = KL is Frobenius with kernel
K and complement L, then the vertices xA and y A lie in the same connected
component if x and y are A-conjugate to elements of L as Z(L) 6= 1. Let A have
m orbits, represented by L = L1 , L2 , . . . , Lm , on the set of Frobenius complements.
Then the above observation shows that for any two elements x and y in G \ K
the vertices xA and y A are connected to each other if and only if they intersect
the same Li . Thus the number of connected components in this case is m + 1. If
G = KLM is 2-Frobenius then the elements of the A-invariant subgroup KL are
distributed in exactly m + 1 connected components if m is the number of A-orbits
on the set of Frobenius complements of KL. Let now x be an element of G \ KL.
Then xK is conjugate in G/K to an element of M K/K. So we can assume without
loss of generality that x ∈ KM \ K. Clearly x = yz for some y ∈ K and z ∈ M.
As L hzi is a Frobenius group acting on V = Ω1 (Z(K)) with L acting fixed point
freely on V we see that z and hence x centralizes an element of Z(K). Thus xA
lies in the unique component containing the A-orbits lying in K. So we have again
m + 1 connected components as claimed.
(ii) follows from [13].

3. when Γ(G, A) contains a complete vertex
In this section our main goal is to characterize the groups G for which Γ(G, A)
is complete for some A ≤ AutG. We first investigate a special case, namely the
existence of a complete vertex. For z ∈ G \ {1} the vertex z A ∈ V (Γ(G, A)) is said
to be a complete vertex
if z A is adjacent to every vertex, and this holds
S if and only
a
if and only if G = a∈A CG (z) . In particular if A/CA (G) ≤ Inn(G), then z A is
complete if and only if G = CG (z), that is z ∈ Z(G) since the union of conjugates
of a proper subgoup of a finite group cannot cover the whole group. This is not true
for arbitrary A ≤ Aut(G) in general. For example, let G be the quaternion group
and A the subgroup of automorphisms of G of order 3. Then A has three orbits on
G \ {1}, each of which is a complete vertex and Γ(G, A) is complete although G is
not abelian.
As a preparation we investigate the influence of the structure of CG (z) on the
structure of G if z is an element of G such that z A is almost complete, that is, z A
is adjacent to every vertex xA for elements x of prime power order.
Throughout the paper we use the following lemma without any further reference.
Lemma 3.1. Let H and N be A-invariant subgroups of G where N E G. Suppose
that xA ∼ y A in Γ(G, A). Then
(i) (xN )A ∼ (yN )A in Γ(G/N, A) if x, y ∈ G \ N ;
(ii) xA ∼ y A in Γ(H, A) if x, y ∈ H.

A condition for nilpotency
Theorem 3.2. Suppose that for any two distinct primes p and q and for all x, y ∈
G \ {1} where x is a p-element and y is a q-element, we have xA ∼ y A . Then G is
nilpotent.
Proof. We use induction on the order of GA and proceed over a series of steps:
(1) Every proper A-invariant subgroup of G is nilpotent. For any A-invariant
normal subgroup N of G, the group G/N is nilpotent.
Proof. They follow easily by induction.



(2) G has a unique minimal normal A-invariant subgroup, say M , where M is
an elementary abelian p-group for some prime p and G/M is nilpotent.
Proof. Let M1 and M2 be two distinct minimal normal A-invariant subgroups of
G. Both G/M1 and G/M2 are nilpotent by (1) and hence so is G, which is a
contradiction. Therefore there is a unique minimal normal A-invariant subgroup,
say M , of G. It follows that M is an elementary abelian p-group for some prime
p or M = G. Suppose that the latter holds. Then G is a characteristically simple
group, that is, G = G1 × · · · × Gk where each Gi is a nonabelian simple group
isomorphic to G1 , and A acts transitively on the set {G1 , . . . , Gk }.
Set A1 = StabA (G1 ). We observe now that the group G1 satisfies the hypothesis
of the theorem with respect to the action of A1 : Pick x, y ∈ G1 where x is a pelement and y is a q-element respectively. Let {t1 = 1, . . . , tk } be a right transversal
Q
for A1 = StabA (G1 ) in A. Set Gi = G1 ti for i = 1, . . . , k. Then X = ki=1 xti and
Qk
Y = i=1 y ti are p- and q-elements of G, respectively and hence there exists a ∈ A
Sk
such that [X, Y a ] = 1 by hypothesis. Clearly we have A = i=1 ti −1 A1 . Suppose
that a ∈ ti0 −1 A1 . Then a = ti0 −1 b for some b ∈ A1 and
Ya =

Notice that i0 6=i=1 y
∈ i=2 Gi . Since [X, Y a ] = 1, we have [x, y b ] = 1.
This establishes the claim that G1 satisfies the hypothesis with respect to the action
of A1 . It follows then that G1 = G by induction, that is, G is a nonabelian simple
group.
Notice that by hypothesis, the Grünberg-Kegel graph GK(G) of G is complete.
One can observe that groups G of prime order are the only simple groups such that
GK(G) is complete: Indeed, if G is a nonabelian simple group and 2 is a complete
vertex of GK(G), then it follows from Theorem 7.1 in [15] that G = An for some
n such that there is no prime in [n − 3, n]. On the other hand, Corollary 7.6 (2) in
[15] shows that there is no such simple group.

(3) G = M Q where Q is an elementary abelian q-group for a prime q 6= p with
[M, Q] = M and CQ (M ) = 1.
Proof. The group G/M = Ḡ is nilpotent by (1). Then Ḡ = Ḡp × Ḡp′ where
Ḡp = P/M and Ḡp′ = QM/M for some Q ∈ Hallp′ (G). If M Q 6= G then it is
nilpotent and hence [M, Q] = 1. On the other hand [P, Q] ≤ M which yields that
[P, Q] = [P, Q, Q] = 1 and hence G is nilpotent. Thus we have G = M Q. Clearly by
induction we see that Q is a q-group for some prime q 6= p, [M, Q] = M , CQ (M ) = 1
and Q = Ω1 (Z(Q)), as claimed.

q for each i. Let x = i=1 xi ∈ M with 1 6= xi ∈ Wi for each i. Now CG (x) =
M CQ (x). Let 1 6= z ∈ CQ (x). Then for each i we have z ∈ CQ (xi ) = CQ (Wi )
and hence z ∈ CQ (M ) = 1, which is impossible. Therefore CQ (x) = 1, that is,
M = CG (x). This contradicts the hypothesis that xA ∼ y A for any y ∈ Q and
completes the proof.


As a direct consequence of the above theorem we have the following.
Theorem 3.3. If Γ(G, A) is complete for some A ≤ AutG then G is nilpotent.
Another upshot of Theorem 3.2 which is also of independent interest can be
given as follows.
Corollary 3.4. Suppose that there exists a vertex z A which is adjacent to every
vertex xA for elements x of prime power order. If CG (z) is nilpotent then so is G.
Proof. Let x and y be p- and q-elements of G for distinct primes p and q. By
hypothesis, xA ∼ z A ∼ y A , that is there are a, b ∈ A such that xa and y b are both
contained in CG (z). It follows by the nilpotency of CG (z) that xa and y b commute.
Then Theorem 3.2 implies that G is nilpotent as desired.

Remark 3.5. Let A = G where G is a nonabelian nilpotent group. Then Γ(G, A)
coincides with the commuting graph on the conjugacy classes which is defined in [8].
Since A = G, the class z A is a complete vertex if and only if z ∈ Z(G). Therefore
Γ(G, A) is not complete and hence the converse of Theorem 3.3 is not true. More
precisely there exist nonabelian nilpotent groups G (for example G = D8 ) such
that Γ(G, A) is not complete for any A ≤ AutG (Γ(D8 , Aut(D8 )) has 3 vertices
corresponding to the orbits of the involution in the center of D8 , the elements of
order 4, and the involutions outside the center of D8 , the last two of the vertices
are not adjacent).
On the other hand there exists a pair (G, A) where G is nonabelian for which
Γ(G, A) is complete: Let G be an extraspecial group of order 33 and of exponent 3.
Then AutG contains a subgroup A which is isomorphic to Q8 and acts transitively
on the set of nontrivial elements of G/Z(G). So Γ(G, A) is complete. This example
also shows that in Corollary 3.4 G need not be abelian if one assumes that CG (z)
is abelian.

A condition for solvability
We shall now present an analogue of Theorem 3.1.
Theorem 3.6. Suppose that for any two distinct primes p and q and for all x, y ∈
G \ {1} where x is a p-element and y is a q-element, there exists a ∈ A such that
the group hx, y a i is solvable. Then G is solvable.
Proof. Let G be a minimal counterexample to the theorem, and let N be a minimal
normal A-invariant subgroup of G. Let xN and yN be nontrivial p- and q-elements
of G/N respectively, for distinct primes p and q. Replacing x and y by suitable
powers, we may assume that x is a p-element and y is a q-element. Then by
hypothesis there is a ∈ A such that the group hx, y a i is solvable. This forces
that the group hxN, (yN )a i is also solvable. Therefore the group G/N satisfies
the hypothesis of the theorem and hence is solvable. It follows then that N is
nonsolvable and hence N = N1 × · · · × Nm such that Ni ∼
= N1 for each i where
N1 is a nonabelian simple group with m ≥ 1. By Theorem B in [6] we get distinct
primes p and q dividing |N1 | such that hu, vi is nonsolvable for all u, v ∈ N1 of
orders p and q respectively. Set now x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) and y = (y1 , . . . , ym ) in N
where xi and yi are elements of Ni of orders p and q, respectively, for i = 1, . . . , m.
Now hx, y a i is a solvable subgroup of N for some a ∈ A and its projection to Ni is
hxi , yj a i for some suitable j, and hence is nonsolvable. This forces that hx, y a i is
nonsolvable, which is a contradiction.

An immediate consequence of Theorem 3.6 is the following analogue of Corollary
3.4.
Corollary 3.7. Suppose that there exists a vertex z A of Γ(G, A) which is adjacent
to every vertex xA for elements x of prime power order. If CG (z) is solvable then
so is G.
Proof. Let x and y be p- and q-elements of G for distinct primes p and q. By
hypothesis, there exist a and b in A such that xa and y b are both contained in
−1
CG (z). Then the group hx, y ba i is solvable. It follows by Theorem 3.6 that G is
solvable.

Remark 3.8. Observe that in Corollary S
3.4 and Corollary 3.7 the essential property
of the group H = CG (z) is that the set a∈A H a contains all the elements of prime
power order in G, and not it is the centralizer of an element. So instead of these
corollaries one could have proven the following interesting result.
PropositionS3.9. Let a group A act on the group G, and let H be a subgroup of
G such that a∈A H a contains all the elements of prime power order in G. Then
G is solvable (resp. nilpotent) if H is solvable (resp. nilpotent).
A consequence of the completeness of a vertex
The following lemma will be needed in the proof of Proposition 3.11 which is
obtained under the assumption that Γ(G, A) contains a complete vertex z A where
z is a p-element for some prime p.
Lemma 3.10. Let G be a nonabelian simple group and let α ∈ Aut(G) of coprime
order. Then π(CG (α)) is a proper subset of π(G).

Proof. If G is a simple group having an automorphism α of prime order p coprime
to |G| then G is a group of Lie type over a field with q p elements and α is an
automorphism arising from the field automorphism of order p where CG (α) is a
group of the same Lie type over the field with q elements. In Table 6 of [3], the
orders of Chevalley groups are listed and are products of cyclotomic polynomials
evaluated at certain powers of the cardinality of the defining field. Looking at the
primitive prime divisors of these polynomials one can easily check that there exists
a prime dividing |G| which does not divide |CG (α)|. This establishes the claim. 
Proposition 3.11. Let z A be a complete vertex of Γ(G, A) where z is a p-element
for a prime p such that CG (z) contains a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Then z ∈ Op (G).
Proof. We use induction on |G| + |z|, and proceed over a series of steps:
(1) Op (G) = 1 and |z| = p.
Proof. An induction argument applied to G/Op (G) shows that Op (G) = 1. If
|z| 6= p, (z p )A is also a complete vertex of Γ(G, A) and so by induction we get
z p ∈ Op (G) = 1.

(2) Let M be a minimal normal A-invariant subgroup of G and P be a Sylow
p-subgroup of G such that z ∈ Z(P ). Then G = M P and G/M = h(zM )A i is an
elementary abelian p-group.
Proof. If z ∈ M then by induction applied to Γ(M, A) we get M = G. If z ∈
/
M then by induction applied to Γ(G/M, A) we get zM ∈ Op (G/M ) = Y /M.
Then Y = M (P ∩ Y ) and z ∈ Z(P ∩ Y ). Let T /M = h(zM )A i. Clearly we
have T /M ≤ Z(Y /M ). Notice that T cannot be a proper subgroup of G because
otherwise induction applied to Γ(T, A) gives that z ∈ Op (T ) ≤ Op (Y ) ≤ Op (G),
which is not possible. So G/M = h(zM )A i is elementary abelian.

(3) M is nonsolvable.
Proof. Suppose first that M is an elementary abelian q-group for some prime q.
Clearly q 6= p and z ∈
/ M . Let MP = M1 ⊕· · ·⊕Ms be the direct sum decomposition
of M into its P -homogeneous components. Now CMi (z) = 1 or Mi as Mi is a sum
of isomorphic irreducible modules.
s
a
LsPick 1 6= xi ∈ Mi for each i = 1, . . . , s. Set x = Σi=1 xi . Then x ∈ CM (z) =
i=1 Mi (z). Since A acts on the set {M1 , . . . , Ms }, we get CMi (z) 6= 1 and hence
CMi (z) = Mi for all i. It follows that z ∈ CP (M ) = Op (G) = 1. This proves that
M is nonsolvable.

(4) M is nonabelian simple if p divides |M |.
Proof. Suppose that M = N1 × · · · × Ns with isomorphic nonabelian simple groups
Ni , i = 1, . . . , s. P ∩ M is a Sylow p-subgroup of M and hence P ∩ Ni is a Sylow
p-subgroup of Ni , i = 1, . . . , s. If P ∩ M 6= 1 then for each i we have P ∩ Ni 6= 1,
and as z ∈ Z(P ) we see that z, and hence each z a , a ∈ A, normalizes each Ni , that
is s = 1. Therefore M is nonabelian simple if p divides |M |, as claimed.

(5) P ∩ M 6= 1.

Proof. Suppose the contrary. Since z A is a complete vertex we have M = a∈A CM (z)a .
Then for any nonidentity element x ∈ N1 there exists a ∈ A such that xa ∈ CM (z).
But then xa ∈ N1a = Nk for some k ∈ {1, . . . , s}, and hence Nk is left invariant by
z and xa ∈ CNk (z). By Lemma 3.9 there exists a prime q dividing the order of Nk
(which is equal to the order of N1 ) which does not divide the order of CNk (z) since
z induces a coprime automorphism of the simple group Nk as
S P ∩M = 1. Therefore

if we choose an element x of N1 of order q it cannot lie in a∈A CM (z)a .
(6) Final contradiction.
Proof. If z ∈ M then we see that the nonabelian simple group G contains p as a
complete vertex in its prime graph GK(G). As it follows from [15], G = An for
some n, and p = 2. Let σ be a k-cycle in G where k = n if n is odd, and
S k = n−1
if n is even. In any case we see that CG (σ) = hσi. But σ has to lie in a∈A CG (z)a
and hence there exists a ∈ A such that z a ∈ CG (σ) which is not possible.
So we are left with the case P ∩ M 6= 1 but z ∈
/ M and M is a nonabelian simple
group. If p is odd, it follows by [7] that the automorphism of M induced by z is
inner, and so there is x ∈ M such that τx−1 = z. ThisSgives that zx ∈ CG (M ) = 1
which is impossible. Thus we have p = 2. Since M = a∈A H a where H = CM (z),
we see that π(M ) = π(H). Now one can invoke Corollary 5, Table 10.7 in [9]
to see that the only possibility is M ∼
= S6 . But this cannot
= P SU (4, 2) and H ∼
happen since M contains an element of order 12 and S6 does not, and the proof is
complete.

4. when Γ(G, A) contains an isolated vertex
In some sense a dual to complete vertices are the isolated vertices. In this
section we study the case where the commuting graph Γ(G, A) of A-orbits of G has
an isolated vertex g A , that is, g 6= 1 and {g A } is a connected component of Γ(G, A).
This forces that either g ∈ Z(G) or Z(G) = 1. In the former case G ⊆ g A ∪ {1}
which implies that G is an elementary abelian group and A acts transitively on
G \ {1}. That is, Γ(G, A) has only one vertex. Throughout this section we shall
assume that Z(G) = 1.
Proposition 4.1. Suppose that A ≤ AutG where Z(G) = 1 and that the graph
Γ(G, A) has an isolated vertex g A . Let p be a prime dividing the order of g. Then
CG (g) is a Sylow p-subgroup of G which is an elementary abelian CC-subgroup of
G, that is, for any nonidentity element x ∈ CG (g), CG (x) = CG (g).
Proof. Observe that CG (g) ⊆ g A ∪ {1}. Then g p cannot be A-conjugate to g and
hence g p = 1. This forces that for all x ∈ g A , xp = 1 and so CG (g) is a group of
exponent p. Let now P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G with CG (g) ≤ P. If 1 6= x ∈ Z(P )
then there exists a ∈ A such that xa = g and hence we get P a ≤ CG (xa ) = CG (g)
showing that CG (g) is a Sylow subgroup of G. For any nonidentity p-element y ∈ G,
−1
there exist z ∈ G and a ∈ A such that y z = g a . Then CG (y) = CG (g)az is a
Sylow p-subgroup of G. It follows by Theorem C in [2] that a Sylow p-subgroup
CG (g) is an elementary abelian CC-subgroup of G.

Appealing to Theorem A of [2] one can classify the groups satisfying our hypothesis. We are not going to give any further comments on this question.

Theorem 4.2. Suppose that A ≤ Aut(G) where Z(G) = 1. Then Γ(G, A) has no
edges and more than one vertex if and only if G is either P SL(2, 5) or a Frobenius
group with elementary abelian kernel and complement of prime order. Furthermore
A is a group of automorphisms such that for any Sylow subgroup P of G, the set
P \ {1} is an NA (P )-orbit.
Proof. By hypothesis for any nonidentity element x ∈ G, the vertex xA is an
isolated vertex. By Proposition 4.1 x is of prime order and its centralizer in G is
a Sylow subgroup of G which is elementary abelian. Therefore G is a CP-group,
that is, every element in G is of prime power order, in which every Sylow subgroup
is elementary abelian. Furthermore if P is a Sylow subgroup of G and 1 6= g ∈ P
then for any g 6= h ∈ P \ {1} there exists a ∈ A such that g a = h, and hence
P a = CG (b) = P which shows that NA (P ) acts transitively on P \ {1} as claimed.
The structure of a CP-group E is known (see [5]) and one of the following holds:
(i) E is a p-group for some prime p;
(ii) E is a Frobenius group with |π(E)| = 2;
(iii) E is a 2-Frobenius group with |π(E)| = 2;
(iv) E is isomorphic to one of the following groups: P SL(2, q) for q ∈ {5, 7, 8, 9, 17}
or P SL(3, 4) or Sz(8) or Sz(32) or M10 or O2 (E) 6= 1 , E/O2 (E) is isomorphic to
one of the following groups P SL(2, q) for q ∈ {4, 8} or Sz(8) or Sz(32). Furthermore
O2 (E) is isomorphic to a direct sum of natural modules for E/O2 (E).
As Z(G) = 1, G is not a p-group. Also G cannot be a 2-Frobenius group with
|π(G)| = 2 and elementary abelian Sylow subgroups because otherwise F (G) must
be a Sylow subgroup. If G is a Frobenius group with π(G) = 2 then the kernel and
the complement must be Sylow subgroups of G and as they are elementary abelian
the Frobenius complement must be cyclic of prime order. Also one can observe that
all nonsolvable groups other than P SL(2, 5) in the list do not satisfy the condition
that each Sylow subgroup is elementary abelian.

5. when Γ(G, A) is triangle free
In this section we work under the hypothesis that Γ(G, A) has no triangles.
Lemma 5.1. For all nonidentity elements x ∈ G, |x| divides p2 for some prime p.
Proof. |x| is a power of a prime for any 1 6= x ∈ G; because otherwise there would
be an element x ∈ G such that |x| = pq for distinct primes p and q. Then the
vertices xA , (xp )A , (xq )A form a triangle, which is contradiction. Also if |x| = p3
2
for some prime p then the vertices xA , (xp )A , (xp )A form a triangle.

Theorem 5.2. If Γ(G, A) is triangle free then G is a CP-group. Furthermore if G
is nonsolvable then either G is isomorphic to one of the simple groups P SL(2, q)
for some q ∈ {5, 7, 8, 9}; or P SL(3, 4); or has a nontrivial normal 2-subgroup and
G/O2 (G) is isomorphic to P SL(2, 4) or P SL(2, 8). In the last case O2 (G) is isomorphic to a direct sum of natural modules of the group G/O2 (G).
Proof. It follows from Lemma 5.1 that G is a CP -group. Therefore its structure is
well known (see the proof of Theorem 4.2). One can observe that S = G/O2 (G) is
not isomorphic to Sz(32), M10 or P SL(2, 17), because the first one of these groups
contains a Sylow 31-subgroup R of order 31 with the property that CS (R) = R
and NAut(Sz(32)) (R)/CSz(32) (R) ∼
= Z10 by [3] so that there are at least 3 A-orbits of

10

elements of order 31 in G which form a triangle, and the last two contain elements
of order 8, which are impossible by Lemma 5.1.
We complete now the proof by showing that G = G/O2 (G) cannot be isomorphic
to Sz(8). Suppose the contrary. Let T be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then Z(T ) is
an elementary abelian group of order 8 and T \ Z(T ) is the subset of T consisting of
elements of order 4. Furthermore NAut(Sz(8)) (T ) = T RS where RS is a Frobenius
group of order 21 with kernel R and complement S. R acts transitively on the set
of nonidentity elements of Z(T ) and also on T /Z(T ) and CT (S) = hxi ∼
= Z4 . If u
and v are two elements of order 4 of T and there exists a ∈ A with ua = v then
(u2 )a = v 2 and u2 , v 2 ∈ Z(T ) \ {1} implying that a ∈ NA (T ). But the number
of NAut(Sz(8)) (T ) -orbits on T \ Z(T ) is 2, each of length 28 and are represented
by an element x of order 4 and its inverse. Observe that CT (x) = Z(T ) hxi . So
we have a triangle {xA , (x−1 )A , y A } where 1 6= y ∈ Z(T ) in Γ(Sz(8), A) for any
A ≤ Aut(Sz(8)). Therefore if O2 (G) = 1 we have a triangle in Γ(G, A) for any
A ≤ Aut(G), which is not the case.
Suppose now that O2 (G) 6= 1. Let u ∈ G with uO2 (G) = x and 1 6= z ∈
O2 (G) ∩ CG (u). Then uA , (u−1 )A , z A form a triangle for any A ≤ Aut(G) which is
impossible.

Remark 5.3. We want explicitly remark that the above theorem does not say anything about the existence of A ≤ AutG such that Γ(G, A) is triangle free for a
given group G. It is an independent and interesting project to classify all such
pairs (G, A).
