We develop and implement a new mathematical and computational framework for designing
photonic elements with one or more high-Q scattering resonances. The approach relies on solving
for the poles of the scattering matrix, which mathematically amounts to minimizing the determinant
of the Fredholm integral operator of the electric field with respect to the permittivity profile of the
scattering element. We apply the method to design subwavelength gradient-permittivity structures
with multiple scattering resonances and quality factors exceeding 500. We also find the spectral
scattering cross sections are consistent with Fano lineshapes. The compact form and computational
efficiency of our formalism suggest it can be a useful tool for designing Fano-resonant structures
with multiple high-Q resonances for applications such as frequency mixing and conversion.

INTRODUCTION

The promise of enhancing nonlinear optical interactions with engineered resonances is longstanding [1â€“6].
Compared to bulk materials, resonant structures provide
larger field enhancement and longer interaction times,
resulting in nonlinear processes at lower pump powers
and within smaller volumes [6â€“9]. In addition, the field
enhancement in resonant structures removes the phasematching requirement for harmonic generation [7, 8].
Of particular interest is the enhancement of harmonic
generation in structures possessing resonances at both
the fundamental and harmonic frequencies [1â€“5]. In principle, the efficiency of second harmonic generation in
doubly-resonant structures scales as Q4Ï‰ Q22Ï‰ [6, 10], where
QÏ‰ and Q2Ï‰ are the quality factors of the resonator at the
fundamental and second harmonic frequencies. Several
authors have attempted to exploit this dependence using a variety of doubly-resonant structures. Early efforts
employed Fabry-Perot cavities [5, 11], photonic crystals
[2, 12], and whispering gallery mode resonators [1, 13, 14].
However, the large modal volumes associated with these
structures limit their practical use. On the other hand,
doubly-resonant plasmonic structures have been shown
to enhance harmonic generation with smaller modal volumes [15â€“17], but the unavoidable material loss limits
their efficiency [9, 18].
More recently, the research has shifted to the use of
Mie resonance in low-loss dielectric resonators [19â€“21].
Mie resonance has been used to enhance harmonic generation in dielectric metasurfaces [8, 22, 23]. However, Mie
resonators have large radiation losses and relatively small
Qs, limiting the gains in efficiency. Dielectric structures
combining Mie resonators with non-radiating elements,
such as rings, can be used to obtain Fano resonances
with high Qs and small mode volumes [24, 25]. Fano resonance in Si-based dielectric metasurfaces have been used
to enhance third harmonic generation [26, 27]. However,
it is unclear how these simple designs would be extended
to obtain the doubly-resonant structures required to enhance harmonic generation.

The challenge of designing structures with multiple
Fano resonances for harmonic generation is better suited
for an inverse design approach [3, 10, 28]. Inverse methods aim to optimize an objective functional by iteratively solving Maxwellâ€™s equations for a variety of material topologies [9]. They have been used to design ring
resonators [28], fibers [10], and gratings [3] for nonlinear frequency conversion [10, 28]. However, the need to
solve Maxwellâ€™s equations iteratively is computationally
expensive and time consuming, limiting the variety of
structures that can be considered.
In this Letter, we develop a new mathematical and
computational framework for designing resonant scatterers that does not require iteratively solving Maxwellâ€™s
equations. Instead, our algorithm is based on optimizing a single constraint condition defined by the poles of
the scattering matrix, which mathematically amounts to
minimizing the determinant of the integral operator of
the electric field with respect to the permittivity profile
of the resonator. Here we develop the approach and implement it to design several resonant structures. First,
we show that a given subwavelength structure can be
designed to resonate at different prescribed wavelengths,
and that the spectral cross sections are consistent with
Fano lineshapes with Qs exceeding 500. Then we show
that the same structure can be designed to resonate at
two prescribed wavelengths simultaneously. The compact form, computational efficiency, and generality of our
approach suggest it can be a reliable inverse design tool
for engineering Fano-resonant structures for enhanced
light-matter interactions.

APPROACH

In this section we derive the condition for scattering
resonances from the integral form of Maxwellâ€™s equations.
The advantage of working with the integral equation is
that the boundary conditions inherent to the scattering
problem are implicit. The condition for scattering resonances will be derived by recasting the integral equation
into matrix form and solving for poles of the electric field.

Following the notations in Refs. [29â€“31], let (x) be
the electric permittivity, Âµ = Âµ0 be the magnetic permeability, and Ïƒ(x) be the electric conductivity, where
(x) = 0 outside a compact region â„¦. We also assume
isotropic media, i.e. , Âµ, and Ïƒ are scalars. With this
notation, the time-harmonic Maxwellâ€™s equation for the
electric field in an inhomogeneous medium is [29â€“31]
âˆ‡ Ã— (âˆ‡ Ã— E(x)) âˆ’ k 2 (1 âˆ’ m(x))E(x) = 0,

where m(x) = 0 outside â„¦. The electric field can be
written as the sum of the incident field Ei (x) and the
scattered field Es (x), where Ei (x) is a solution to the
homogeneous equation [29â€“31]
âˆ‡ Ã— (âˆ‡ Ã— Ei (x)) âˆ’ k 2 Ei (x) = 0,

and Es (x) satisfies the Silver-MuÌˆller radiation condition

The equivalent integral equation form of Eq. (1), consis-

tent with Eqs. (2) and (3), is [30]

where H0 (x) is the Hankel function of the

To write Eq. (4) in matrix form, we discretize â„¦ on a
uniform Cartesian grid with n points per dimension and
step size h, and write the convolution (Toeplitz) matrices
as
Gi,j = h3 G(ih âˆ’ jh),

Gdi,j = h3 Gd (ih âˆ’ jh),

where the subscripts denote discrete indices. With these
notations, Eq. (4) can be expressed as the following matrix equation [29â€“31]

RESULTS

In this section, we apply Eq. (7) to design several
photonic resonators. For demonstration, we consider
a two-dimensional circular structure with transverselypolarized electric field. In this case, the second integral
in Eq. (4) is zero and the condition for scattering resonances in Eq. (7) simplifies to
det(I + k 2 Gm) = 0.

(8)

(6)

where I is the identity matrix. Since resonances correspond to singularities of the electric field, the condition
for scattering resonances leads to the requirement [32]
det(I âˆ’ T ) = 0.

d = 1, 2, 3.

(7)

Equation (7) forms the basis of our inverse design approach. It can be solved using standard optimization
algorithms such as the Levenberg-Marquardt method.

First, we design a resonator element with a single high-Q
resonance at a wavelength of 1 Âµm. To ensure the retrieved permittivity can be fabricated from realistic materials, we constrain r to be purely real and less than
16 (corresponding to Ge). We also constrain the diameter to the shortest wavelength considered (0.4 Âµm). This
ensures the structure can be incorporated into a nondiffracting array. With these constraints, we solve Eq.
(8) using the fsolve function in MATLAB, which is based
on the Levenberg-Marquardt method.

section, and electric field at (c) 1 Âµm and (d) 0.5 Âµm.

Figure 1a shows a cross sectional plot of the retrieved
permittivity profile. It is approximately four-point symmetric with values ranging from 4 to 12. There are also
four low-permittivity regions along the polar direction.
Figure 1b shows the scattering cross section for light incident along the y direction. As expected, there is a high-Q
resonance at the design wavelength of 1 Âµm. The cross
section also exhibits a null near the resonance peak, indicating Fano resonance behavior [24]. To confirm this, we
fit the resonance to a Fano lineshape and find excellent
agreement for Q = 570. Figure 1c shows the electric field
amplitude at 1 Âµm. The field resembles a quadrupole
mode with four maxima along the polar direction and
values exceeding 8, 000 relative to the incident field. The
maxima appear to coincide with the regions of low permittivity. For reference, Fig. 1d shows the field away
from resonance at 0.5 Âµm. In this case, there is no significant field enhancement.
Next, we apply to formalism to design a structure with
the same form factor and constraints, but with a resonance at half the wavelength (0.5 Âµm). Figure 2a shows
the retrieved permittivity profile. It ranges from 2 to
7 with eight distinct minima along the polar direction.
The scattering cross section for light incident along the y
direction is shown in Fig. 2b. As desired, there is a high
Q resonance at 0.5 Âµm. The resonance peak fits a Fano
lineshape with Q = 490 (not shown). Figures 2c and d
show the field amplitudes at 1 Âµm and 0.5 Âµm, respectively. Away from resonance at 1 Âµm, there is no significant field enhancement, while at resonance, the field
is enhanced by more than 104 . The fields are concentrated around with perimeter with eight maxima along
the polar direction, consistent with an octupole mode.
Lastly, we apply the formalism to design a structure

with the same form factor and constraints, with high-Q
scattering resonances at two wavelengths: 1 Âµm and 0.5
Âµm. In this case, we performed a multiobjective optimization to minimize both determinants,
det(I + k12 G(k1 )m) = 0,

det(I + k22 G(k2 )m) = 0, (9)

where the subscripts denote the two different wavelengths. Figure 3a shows the permittivity profile. It is
approximately two-point symmetric with values ranging
from 4 to 13. Figure 3b shows the scattering cross section
for light incident along the y direction. As desired, there
are resonances at both 1 Âµm and 0.5 Âµm. Fitting the resonances to the Fano lineshape, we obtain Qs of 270 and
720 at 1 Âµm and 0.5 Âµm, respectively. Figures 3c and d
show the electric field amplitudes at 1 Âµm and 0.5 Âµm,
respectively. At 1 Âµm, the field is clearly a quadrupole
mode, while at 0.5 Âµm the field is multimodal, with four
maxima both inside and outside the structure. The field
enhancement is greater than 103 at both wavelengths.
SUMMARY

We developed a new inverse computational framework
for designing photonic structures with multiple scattering
resonances. In contrast with conventional inverse methods, our algorithm does not require solving Maxwellâ€™s
equations for each material topology, and thus promises
more efficient inverse computation. Our algorithm is
based on optimizing a single constraint condition that defines the poles of the scattering matrix, which mathematically amounts to minimizing the determinant of the integral operator of the electric field with respect to the permittivity profile of the resonator. In this Letter, we devel-
