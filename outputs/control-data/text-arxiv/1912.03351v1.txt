ABSTRACT

A massive planet in a protoplanetary disc will open a gap in the disc material. A steep
gap edge can be hydrodynamically unstable, which results in the formation of vortices
that can act as tracers for the presence of planets in observational results. However, in
a viscous disc, the potential formation of these vortices is dependent on the timescale
over which the massive planet accretes mass and with a sufficiently long timescale it
is possible for no vortices to form. Hence, there is a connection between the presence
of vortices and the growth timescale of the planet and it may therefore be possible to
exclude a planetary interpretation of observed structure from the absence of vortices.
We have investigated the effect of the planet growth timescale on vortex formation
for a range of planet masses and viscosities and have found an approximate relation
between the planet mass, viscosity and planet growth timescale for which vortices
are not formed within the disc. We then interpret these results in the light of recent
observations. We have also found that planets do not need to be close to a Jupiter
mass to form vortices in the disc if these discs have low viscosity, as these can be
caused by planets as small as a few Neptune masses.

INTRODUCTION

Planets form in protoplanetary discs via the accretion of
dust and gas. These planets will excite density waves in the
disc material that transport angular momentum from the
planet and deposit it in the disc, exerting a torque on the
disc material. If the deposition of torque is close enough to
the planet (Lin & Papaloizou 1993; Bryden et al. 1999) and
the resultant torque is stronger than the viscous diffusion
of the disc material (Lin & Papaloizou 1979; Goldreich &
Tremaine 1980; Takeuchi et al. 1996; Crida et al. 2006) then
a low density region, a gap, is formed around the orbital
location of the planet. These two criteria are known as the
thermal and viscous criteria for gap opening.
Observational results over the past few years (e.g.
ALMA Partnership et al. 2015; Andrews et al. 2016; van
der Marel et al. 2019) have provided high resolution images
and information about the features that exist across the lifetime of protoplanetary discs. One important feature we can
see from these images is the presence of dark bands in the
dust emission of the disc. A clear example of this can be

seen in images of the protoplanetary disc HL Tau (ALMA
Partnership et al. 2015). While we do not currently have a
definitive answer as to what causes these, there is a possibility they could be planetary in origin, gaps formed by massive
planets within the disc. Unfortunately, even assuming these
dark bands are the result of planet-disc interaction, there is
a degeneracy in the planet masses and disc viscosities that
can adequately explain them (e.g. Mulders et al. 2013). If
both the disc viscosity and the planet mass are unknown,
almost any gap can be explained by a planet. Hence, we
would benefit greatly from a method that would allow us to
rule out a planet of a given mass from having formed a gap.
When a planet opens a gap in the disc, there is the potential for the excitement of instabilities in the disc material.
The steep edge of a gap carved by a planet is prone to hydrodynamic instabilities such as the Rossby wave instability.
The non-linear evolution of this instability can result in the
formation of vortices at the gap edge (Lovelace et al. 1999;
Li et al. 2000).
Vortices are potential explanations for brightness asymmetries seen at the edge of a gap or cavity in observational
results (van der Marel et al. 2013; Fukagawa et al. 2013;
Pérez et al. 2014; Marino et al. 2015; Kraus et al. 2017;

Dong et al. 2018; Cazzoletti et al. 2018). Numerical simulations show that indeed massive planets can excite the Rossby
wave instability (de Val-Borro et al. 2006, 2007; Fu et al.
2014a). However, vortices can also be formed by processes
that do not involve a planet (e.g. Lovelace et al. 1999; Li
et al. 2000; Klahr & Bodenheimer 2003; Lyra & Klahr 2011;
Regály et al. 2012; Raettig et al. 2013; Lyra 2014; Bae et al.
2015). Despite this, it is not unbelievable that the observed
vortices in the discs were formed as a result of planets we
cannot see. In many of the simulations in which these vortices occur the formation of the planet is not accounted for.
In other words, the planet is already at its maximum mass
before it begins to open a gap in the disc. As the strength of
the deposited torque is dependent on the mass of the planet,
the gap will open slower for a planet growing in mass than
for a planet at maximum mass, giving the disc time to adjust
viscously. It has been shown by Hammer et al. (2017) that
over sufficient growth timescales it is possible for a massive
planet to open a gap without exciting the Rossby wave instability and therefore without producing vortices. Hence, it
may be possible to rule out a planet of a certain mass as
the creator of the gap based on the presence or absence of
vortices in the disc. Additionally, recent investigation into
the shape of planet induced vortices have accounted for the
timescale over which the planet grows and have found that
vortices can become elongated (Hammer et al. 2017). As
a result elongated vortices have their own specific observational features (Hammer et al. 2019) that have potentially
been observed (Pérez et al. 2014; Cazzoletti et al. 2018).
However, the majority of observational results do not show
the features that imply elongated vortices, although this may
be due to the resolution of the observations
In this paper we are investigating the required planet
growth timescales for which no vortices are formed in a protoplanetary disc. We study this for a range of masses and
viscosities, with the aim to find an approximate relation
between these parameters. This approximate relation could
then be used to estimate limits for parameters of observed
protoplanetary discs, or to determine whether or not it is
likely that a planet exists in these discs. This acts to constrain the mass of a planet that can be formed in a disc
of a certain age and viscosity, based on the presence or absence of vortices in the disc. Therefore, we aim for our result
to aid in breaking the degeneracy that exists in explaining
observed disc structure using planets.
This paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the relevant equations solved to simulate disc evolution.
In Section 3, we discuss the code and numerical setup for our
simulations. In Section 4, we present our results. In Section
5, we compare our findings to prior observational work. In
Section 6 we discuss our results and any assumptions made
in our simulations. Finally, in Section 7, we present our conclusions.

sions, making the approximation of a locally isothermal disc.
As the Hill sphere of the planet is larger than the scale height
for gap opening, the disc appears two dimensional with respect to the planet. Hence, it is safe to assume that the
approximation of two dimensions is sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions from.

where v is the velocity field. We simulate the evolution of
a protoplanetary disc’s surface density due to the presence
of a planet by solving the two dimensional Navier-Stokes
equation for the motion of the disc,

where T is the Newtonian viscous stress tensor, P is the
pressure and Φ is the gravitational potential of the planet
and star system. A cylindrical coordinate system is used,
such that v = (vR , RΩ) where vR and Ω are the radial and
angular velocities at a given radius. We assume the disc is
locally isothermal, with an equation of state P = c2s Σ where
cs (R) is the sound speed at cylindrical radius R. We impose
a constant aspect ratio h = H/R where H is the disc scale
height. The sound speed in the disc is given by:

2.2

Growing the planet mass

In our simulations it is important that the planet mass is
not constant, it should grow with time over a number of
orbits. This is in an attempt to eliminate the excitation of
instabilities and formation of vortices that otherwise would
be present if the planet is initialised at its maximum mass.
Therefore we grow the planet mass over a timescale tG for
t ≤ tG using the following relation

BASIC EQUATIONS

In this paper we perform a parameter study to find the
growth timescales for which the Rossby wave instability is
not excited by gap formation in a protoplanetary disc. We investigate a wide range of viscosities, mass ratios and growth
timescales and so perform this study in two spatial dimen-

2.3

Rossby wave instability

The Rossby wave instability can occur due to a steep gradient in the radial profile of the angular velocity of the disc. In
a disc with a gap opening planet, this location corresponds
to the gap edge in the surface density of the disc. Using a
long enough planet growth timescale, we expect the gap to

Disc structure and planet mass
open slower and hence the disc viscosity has more time to
smooth out the steep gap edges. This will result in a smaller
gradient in the velocity profile of the disc at this location.
For the Rossby wave instability to be excited within an
adiabatic disc there must be a local maximum or minimum
in the key function (Lovelace et al. 1999),
2

L(R) = FS γ

(5)

where F is approximately the inverse of the potential vorticity, S = P/Σγ is the entropy and γ is the ratio of specific
heats. As this function clearly has surface density dependence, the opening of a gap in the disc will have an effect on
whether the Rossby wave instability is excited and we would
expect to see a local maximum or minimum occurring near
a steep gap edge in the surface density of the disc. The presence of a maximum or minimum in this function is only one
prerequisite for the excitation of the Rossby wave instability, it must also exceed a threshold value before the Rossby
wave instability is excited (Lovelace et al. 1999; Ono et al.
2016). Hence, from this function alone we cannot predict
the Rossby stability of a system. In addition, our simulations are not adiabatic, they are locally isothermal and as
such are in the limit of γ → 1. It is therefore difficult to predict whether the Rossby wave instability will be present a
priori and we therefore determine from simulations whether
the Rossby wave instability has led to the formation of vortices by calculating the potential vorticity across the disc.
The potential vorticity is given by,

radial domain of 0.3 ≤ R/R0 ≤ 6.0 and an azimuthal domain of −π ≤ φ ≤ π with 285 by 596 cells respectively,
using logarithmic cell spacing in the radial direction and
the planet located at R = R0 . The initial surface density is
Σint = Σ0 (R/R0 )−1/2 with Σ0 = 2.67 × 10−3 . The indirect
potential due to the planet is accounted for and the mass of
the disc is arbitrary, as the planet does not feel the disc material. To achieve this, FARGO3D has been modified so that
the indirect potential caused by the disc can be turned off
separately. Reflecting boundary conditions were used with
wave killing zones in the regions 0.3 ≤ R/R0 ≤ 0.585 and
5.43 ≤ R/R0 ≤ 6.0 similarly to de Val-Borro et al. (2006),
meaning that excited waves are damped before reaching the
edge of the simulation. The planet is held on a fixed circular
orbit with no migration or disc self gravity accounted for.
We use a constant kinematic viscosity ν and a fixed aspect
ratio h. We vary both the final mass ratio, qf and ν between
simulations.
We run our simulations for a number of orbits beyond
the chosen planet growth timescale, tG , in order to ensure
the Rossby wave instability is not excited shortly after the
planet has reached its maximum mass. This depends on the
gap formation timescale and viscous timescale of the disc
and as a result will vary depending on the plant mass and
viscosity, however is often of the order of a few hundred
orbits.

A local minimum in the potential vorticity of the disc indicates the presence of a vortex, which is the non-linear outcome of the Rossby wave instability.
In addition to observing the two dimensional potential
vorticity distribution, we also investigate the orbit-to-orbit
difference in the potential vorticity of the disc. This method
is helpful when instabilities are marginal and more difficult
to determine from the two dimensional distribution. As the
vortices have a different orbital velocity to that of the planet,
we will see them move on an orbit-to-orbit basis, therefore
if we see a sudden increase in the orbit-to-orbit maximum
potential vorticity difference we can imply the presence of
the Rossby wave instability.

NUMERICAL SETUP

Our simulations are run in two dimensions using the
FARGO3D code. This is a magnetohydrodynamic code designed to simulate disc evolution in one to three dimensions by solving the hydrodynamic equations of motion.
FARGO3D is a good choice for investigating gap opening
planets as it uses a C to CUDA translator to allow simulations to be run on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
GPUs have limited memory, but decrease computational
time significantly, allowing moderate resolution simulations
to be run for extended periods of time. For more details see
Benı́tez-Llambay & Masset (2016).
Our simulations use a disc model that extends over a

RESULTS
Method

We run our simulations for a range of mass ratios, 1.5 ×
10−4 ≤ q ≤ 10−3 and disc viscosities 10−6 ≤ ν ≤ 10−5 . For
each combination of planet mass and viscosity, we investigate the planet growth timescale for which we do not observe
the formation of vortices in the disc. We use an aspect ratio h = 0.05 for the majority of our simulations. We focus
on this one aspect ratio to reduce the size of the parameter
space we investigate, in order to lower the computational
time necessary. However, we do investigate changing the aspect ratio in Section 4.4.
In order to determine the timescale at which vortices
are not formed we calculate the potential vorticity across
the disc. From this we determine the orbit-to-orbit maximum potential vorticity difference. As the vortices orbit at
a different speed to the planet they move on an orbit-to-orbit
basis. An extreme example of these vortices can be seen in
Figure 1, which shows the formation of vortices in a tG = 0
setup. This is an extreme case for the purpose of showing the
vortices and using a growth timescale tG > 0 will reduce the
magnitude of these vortices. Hence approaching the values
of tG that stabilise the disc it will become more and more
difficult to identify the presence of vortices from these plots.
Such marginal cases are still important to distinguish,
as it is known that vortices are efficient at trapping dust and
this could enhance the visibility of a vortex observationally
(Barge & Sommeria 1995). If these vortices form a sharp
increase in the orbit-to-orbit potential vorticity difference
this should imply the excitation of the Rossby wave instability. An example of using the potential vorticity difference
to highlight the presence of vortices can be seen in Figure

4

Hallam & Paardekooper

Figure 1. An example of vortices clearly visible in the two dimensional potential vorticity distribution of the disc. In this case
the disc has ν = 8 × 10−6 with a qf = 6 × 10−4 planet and a
tG = 0, meaning that the planet is initialised in the disc at t = 0
at its final mass.

2. In this case we can see the comparison between a stable
simulation with tG = 500 and a simulation with tG = 300.
Here tG = 300 is the boundary beyond which vortices form.
In the stable case the potential vorticity difference has some
small variations but is overall roughly constant, while in the
boundary case there is a noticable increase in the potential
vorticity difference. The appearance of vortices signals an
even larger potential vorticity difference, and as the system
becomes more unstable the magnitude of this increase in potential vorticity difference becomes larger. For example, the
vortices in Figure 1 produce a maximum ∆ξ ≈ 200 − 300.
This highlights how useful this method is to identifying these
vortices.
In particularly marginal cases, in which it becomes difficult to determine stability solely from the potential vorticity
difference, we also use the two dimensional potential vorticity distribution to aid in determining whether or not the
system is stable. An example of using the two dimensional
potential vorticity distribution to determine if a vortex is
present can be seen in Figure 3, which shows two simulations with tG = 1400 and tG = 1000 both at t = 1500.
While this is a considerably clearer case of vortex formation,
this highlights the difference between a stable and unstable
system.
We limit our potential vorticity difference calculations
to the region close to the gap edge where the vortices are
formed, excluding a region ∆φ ≈ 0.95 either side of the
planet. We do this because even in cases where there is little
to no vortices small fluctuations in the location of the gap
edge or the planet’s wake, on the order of one to two radial
cells can cause very large potential vorticity differences for
steep gap edges. This can cause a false result implying the
presence of vortices when there are none, hence we must take
care to exclude this from our sampling region.
In addition, in some cases we find that weak features
can be present in the potential vorticity distribution of the
disc, even in simulations that are Rossby stable. These may
be due to the interaction between orbiting material and
the planet’s outer wake, in which material orbiting past the
planet’s wake receives a decrease in potential vorticity flowing past the shock. This can be seen in the stable system in
the left panel of Figure 3. This mechanism was first identified by Koller et al. (2003). These weak features often have

Illustrated here is the difference between a stable case, with tG =
500 and a boundary case, with tG = 300. The parameters for
these two simulations are ν = 10−5 and qf = 9 × 10−4 . For
comparison, a tG = 0 results in a ∆ξ ≈ 400 − 1000 at it’s most

no impact on the potential vorticity difference, even in the
rare cases in which they stray out of the excluded zones.

4.2

Error Estimates

As we discretely sample the growth timescale, a higher sampling resolution will provide a more accurate value of the
growth timescale at which vortices do not appear. Therefore,
we choose errors on our selected growth timescale based on
our sampling resolution. This should account for the possibility that the exact value we are looking for lies between our
sampled growth timescales. In selecting whether a growth
timescale results in the formation of vortices or not, we first
make an educated guess at the growth timescale that results
in no vortices and perform a simulation. We analyse the result of this, and increase or decrease the growth timescale
by an amount, usually on the order of a few hundred orbits,
but heavily dependent on the accuracy of the initial guess
and the computational time required to complete the simulation. This is an iterative process, until we find the smallest growth timescale for which the system has no vortices.
Hence, we have a discrete resolution in growth timescale,
which is necessary to reduce computational time. The error
due to this gets larger as the growth timescale increases, as
these are more computationally expensive. Based on these
considerations, for the purposes of this study we select errors
as presented in Table 1.

the presence of the vortex.

and viscosities. This information is also presented in Figure
4 which fits exponential curves of the form:
qf

t = t0 e q 0

(7)

where t0 and q0 are constants dependent on the fit, given
in Table 3. From this figure we can see that the best fit
exponential curves are a reasonable fit to the data and that
as we increase the viscosity the curves become less steep and
q0 increases. From this we find a relation between q0 and the
viscosity,
ν = 9.1884 × 10−4 q00.5588

(8)

This relation can be seen in Figure 5. This shows a reasonable fit to the data in the mid to high viscosity regime,
however deviation begins to become significant in the low
viscosity regions.
As t0 does not follow a simple law (see Table 3) we cannot predict how t0 evolves with viscosity. Hence, we cannot
determine a continuous relation between the viscosity and
planet growth timescale. This, in combination with Equation 8’s poor fitting at low viscosities means that we use
Equation 7 at our discrete viscosity intervals to form a relation between mass and viscosity. We can then use Equation
7 evaluated at these viscosities in order to make statements
about the potential masses of gap opening planets and viscosities of the disc based on the age of the system in question, using observational results regarding the detection or
absence of vortices within these discs.
From Figure 4 we can see that for higher viscosity discs
it is possible to form more massive planets over shorter
timescales, without creating vortices. Consider the planets
formed with qf = 6 × 10−4 . At ν = 10−5 , it is possible to
form this planet in only 100 orbits with no vortices created.
However, as we lower the viscosity the growth timescale to
form this planet without creating vortices increases. Hence,
at ν = 6 × 10−6 the same planet takes 2000 orbits to form
without creating vortices.
Another important result we can see in Figure 4 pertains to the masses of planets that can form vortices in the
disc. The exponential best fit curves in Figure 4 show the
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

minimum growth timescale required for a planet of a given
mass to form without creating vortices. As we can see there
is large parameter space at lower viscosities in which planets can create vortices while forming. Indeed, it is not even
necessary for such planets to be particularly massive. For
example consider a disc with ν = 2 × 10−6 . In this disc,
if a planet of qf = 2 × 10−4 is to form over a timescale
tG < 1400, it will create vortices in the disc. This planet is
a similar mass to Saturn, and significantly less massive than
Jupiter. Hence, if discs have low viscosities we may not need
to predict planets on the order of Jupiter’s mass to explain
potential vortices in observational results.
4.4

Larger aspect ratio

So far we have only discussed the formation of vortices in
a disc with h = 0.05. It is expected that as the disc aspect ratio changes, so will the planet growth timescale required for a planet to be formed without creating vortices,
for a given viscosity and planet mass. We have investigated
this behaviour, increasing the aspect ratio of the disc from
h = 0.05 to h = 0.06. We only investigate one different aspect ratio and only for a small number of setups. Adding
this additional parameter to our investigation into qf and ν
would be infeasible due to increased computational time required. However, we can make a physically motivated guess
at how the results vary by changing h and then perform a
number of simulations to check this.
We know that the gap depth is set by the K parameter

where ν = αcs H. Hence, we may expect that holding the K
parameter constant while increasing the aspect ratio gives
similar results. However, a constant K at a given h is degenerate in qf and ν and therefore we need a method of
selecting values for these parameters. To this end we use the
relation qf /h3 to set qf at the increased aspect ratio. This
relation governs the non-linearity of the flow in the inviscid
case (Korycansky & Papaloizou 1996). Using this we keep

the non-linearity of the flow constant, while now having specific values for the parameters qf and ν at our selected value
of h = 0.06. With these parameters we find a similar result to
the h = 0.05 case, namely an unstable run remains unstable
and a stable run remains stable, however using these parameters does seem to slightly improve the overall stability of
the system compared to the h = 0.05 case. Therefore, we investigate using the relation qf /h2 to select qf and ν instead,
still with h = 0.06. Using these parameters we found had the
opposite effect, driving the system more towards instability
and vortex formation compared to the respective h = 0.05
case. These results can be seen in Figure 6 which shows the
orbit-to-orbit potential vorticity difference that we use as a

the power of h in the parameter setting relation. Here we can

the aspect ratio by holding K constant, however depending on
how the parameters are selected the system may be forced more
towards stability or vortex formation.

tracer for vortex formation for both h = 0.06 cases and the
h = 0.05 case. The h = 0.05 setup has ν = 9.0 × 10−6 and
qf = 9.0 × 10−4 , while all setups have tG = 600. Clearly it
can be seen that the qf /h2 case is driven more towards vortex formation, while the qf /h3 case is closer to reproducing
the same results as h = 0.05. The earlier increase in potential vorticity difference occurs as the gap opens faster in the
higher planet mass cases. From these results we can see that
using the relation qf /h3 gives reasonably consistent results
with h = 0.05, despite the increase to h = 0.06, whereas
qf /h2 is less consistent. However, we do not know if this
result is applicable in every setup.

COMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS

In the previous section we have found an approximate relation between the mass of a planet and the viscosity of
the disc that predicts the growth timescale of the planet
required in order for the planet to form without creating
vortices within the disc. This is a result which allows us to
make comparisons with observational data. Specifically we
can use observational evidence for both the presence and absence of vortices in protoplanetary discs that show structure
indicative of embedded planets. From these we can make
tentative statements about the parameters of the discs and
planets in question.
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

An important consideration in our analysis here is the
choice of growth timescale for planets within the discs.
Whereas planet masses and disc viscosities are often predicted parameters from observational results, which we can
use in our comparison, planet growth timescale is not often
considered. As a result, for the comparisons in this section
we use the age of the system as a limit on the planet growth
timescale. For a planet in a disc that has reached maximum
mass, the growth timescale of the planet cannot exceed the
lifetime of the disc. Hence the growth timescales considered
here represent the maximum possible growth timescale for a
planet in that disc. As we use ages considerably longer than
the growth timescales fit by Equation 7, we have to assume
that our fits are still applicable in this regime.
Additionally, we have generally endeavoured to make
statements using the units of mass presented in the papers
to which we are comparing. However, for ease of comparison
we also provide the conversion to mass ratio q alongside
each. With regards to viscosity, many of the papers to which
we are comparing use a turbulent α viscosity (Shakura &
Sunyaev 1973). We provide the conversion the the kinematic
viscosity given the disc parameters used in our setup, at the
location of the planet R = R0 .

5.1.1

Axisymmetric discs
HL Tau

One of the most well documented protoplanetary discs of the
last few years is HL Tau (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015), for
good reason as it is one of the highest resolution images of a
protoplanetary disc we currently have, in addition to showing very interesting structure. The origin of this structure
is still debated, as there are a number of different proposed
factors that can explain the gap structure observed, besides
planets. Nevertheless there are some factors that support
the hypothesis that planets have carved these gaps, as the
locations of these dark bands are located close to the resonances between planets orbiting at these radial locations
(Wolf et al. 2002; ALMA Partnership et al. 2015). Dipierro
et al. (2015) performed smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulations to estimate the masses of planets that could potentially explain this structure. Their results imply that the
observed structure could be the result of three planets of
masses q = 2.0 × 10−4 , 2.7 × 10−4 and 5.5 × 10−4 located at
13.2, 32.3 and 68.8AU respectively. This prediction is very
interesting to us, as crucially the HL Tau system shows no

Figure 7. Maximum masses of planets that can be formed over a
timescale tG in a disc of a given viscosity. tG is set by the number
of orbits able to be completed by a planet orbiting at a radius
R over the lifetime of the disc. This means that masses above
this line will not form at this radius without creating vortices,
while masses below will, according to our result in Equation 7.
In this case the three radius’ chosen correspond to the predicted
locations of planets in the disc HL Tau (Dipierro et al. 2015).

sign of vortices. Using Equation 7 and assuming tG = 1Myr
(an upper limit on the age of the HL Tau system (Testi
et al. 2015)), we can determine if our predictions regarding vortex formation agree with their planet masses. The
results of this can be seen in Figure 7, which shows the
solution to Equation 7 for a range of viscosities. Dipierro
et al. (2015) use a turbulent viscosity (Shakura & Sunyaev
1973) of α ≈ 0.005 (ν = 1.25 × 10−5 ), however more recent
results from dust settling models imply that for HL Tau
α ≈ 10−4 (ν = 2.5 × 10−7 ) is an upper limit (Pinte et al.
2016). Dipierro et al. (2015) use a flared disc with aspect
ratio hin = 0.04 and hout = 0.08.
From Figure 7 we can see that our results are consistent with this prediction for the very large viscosity cases.
For ν > 8 × 10−6 we predict it is possible to form planets
up to ≈ 1MJ (q = 1.0 × 10−3 ) at all of these radii with no
vortices created. Using ν = 2.5 × 10−7 it appears that the
planets predicted by Dipierro et al. (2015) are unable to form
without creating vortices. Our results predict that planets
with masses of roughly q = 2.5 × 10−5 are the largest that
could form here without creating vortices. Using the viscosity from Dipierro et al. (2015) however it is very clear from
our results that their planets could form without creating
vortices.
Jin et al. (2016) make predictions in a lower viscosity regime than Dipierro et al. (2015). They imply that the
observed structure can be explained by planets of masses
0.35MJ , 0.17MJ and 0.26MJ (q = 3.5, 1.7 and 2.6 × 10−4
respectively) at approximately the same radii as above. Jin
et al. (2016) use a disc viscosity of α = 10−3 (ν = 2.5×10−6 )
which lies in between the above viscosities. Fortunately, this
viscosity also lies within our explored parameter space. From
Figure 7 we can see that at this viscosity we can expect planets of q ≈ 2.5 − 3.5 × 10−4 to form without creating vortices.
Therefore, the planets of Jin et al. (2016) are roughly the
maximum mass planets our results predict could be present
in the HL Tau disc at this viscosity. Hence, our results show
consistency with their predictions.

TW Hydrae

Another well documented disc that shows similar features
to HL Tau is TW Hydrae, also the result of high resolution
ALMA observations (Andrews et al. 2016). This disc also
shows axisymmetric dark radial rings that could potentially
be the result of gaps formed by planet disc interactions. An
interesting difference between TW Hydrae and HL Tau is
that while the latter is a young disc, TW Hydrae is particularly old, with an age of 3 − 15Myr (Sokal et al. 2018).
Another difference that separates these discs is the dark
bands themselves. In TW Hydrae these dark bands are significantly brighter (compared to the surrounding disc) and
narrower than those in HL Tau. The masses of planets that
could potentially explain these gaps has been investigated by
van Boekel et al. (2017), using the results of Duffell (2015)
and was found to be in the range of several earth masses.
This corresponds to roughly 4 − 10ME , 10 − 20ME and
25 − 50ME (q(1ME ) ≈ 3.0 × 10−6 ) at 6.0, 21.0 and 85.0AU
respectively, for viscosities between α = 1.0 − 4.0 × 10−4
(ν = 2.5 × 10−7 − 1.0 × 10−6 ). From our results we predict
that the gaps at 6 and 21AU are capable of being opened by
these planets without forming vortices (except for the gap
at 21AU in the lowest viscosity case). However, our results
imply that the larger mass planet at 85AU could not form
there without creating vortices. These predictions are based
on extrapolation, as we have not investigated at viscosities
this low. Tsukagoshi et al. (2016) also imply that the most
prominent, central gap could be caused by an approximately
1.5 Neptune mass planet (q = 7.72 × 10−5 ) in an h = 0.05,
α = 10−3 (ν = 2.5 × 10−6 ) disc. As this planet is low mass
and TW Hydrae is an older star, our results predict that
this planet could form without causing the creation of vortices. Hence we display some consistency here with previous
studies.

5.1.3

Taurus star forming region

More recently, Long et al. (2018) performed an analysis on
32 discs in the Taurus star forming region using ALMA.
From this sample 12 discs containing axisymmetric structure were identified. This structure takes the form of dark
band bright ring pairs, emission bumps and cavities. Overall
19 gap ring pairs were identified, indicating that a number
of these systems contain multiple gaps. These gaps range
in location from R = 10 − 120AU with no preferred distance. The majority of these gaps are narrow, but the weak
correlation between gap location and gap width potentially
implies formation via planet-disc interactions. In addition a
significant number of these gaps can not be explained by
condensation fronts. Long et al. (2018) perform an analysis on the width of these gaps in order to determine possible
masses of planets that could form them. Assuming the width
of the gaps corresponds to 4RHill (Dodson-Robinson & Salyk
2011) they estimate the masses of the planets to be in the
0.1 − 0.5MJ (q = 1.0 × 10−4 − 5.0 × 10−4 ) range, however
they stress that these masses have large uncertainties and
that the gap widths may be as large as 7 − 10RHill (Pinilla
et al. 2012). Alternatively they compare the distance between the minimum of the gaps and the maximum of the
rings to the results of hydrodynamic simulations (Rosotti
et al. 2016) with an α = 10−4 (ν = 2.5 × 10−7 ), resulting in
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

Disc structure and planet mass

Figure 8. Maximum masses that can be formed over a timescale
tG in a disc of a given viscosity, similarly to Figure 7. In this
case the radius’ chosen correspond to the predicted locations of
planets in the sample of 12 discs analysed by (Long et al. 2018).
Specifically this plot focusses on the region for which planets of
masses in the range 0.1 − 0.5MJ (q = 1.0 × 10−4 − 5.0 × 10−4 )
can form.

a predicted planet mass of 0.05MJ (q = 5.0 × 10−5 ) and an
α = 10−2 (ν = 2.5 × 10−5 ), resulting in a predicted planet
mass of 0.3MJ (q = 3.0 × 10−4 ). Using Equation 7 and an
estimated disc lifetime of 2Myr (based on stellar age estimates for the spectral type of the target stars (Baraffe et al.
2015; Feiden 2016)) we can see that in the higher viscosity
case planets of 0.3MJ (q = 3.0 × 10−4 ) can form at any
of these radii without creating vortices. The lower viscosity case is more difficult to predict as it is significantly lower
than the viscosities we have explored, however for this planet
mass it seems unlikely from our results that the predicted
planet could form without creating vortices. Instead, we expect the maximum mass planets that could be found here to
be roughly half the mass they predict. In addition, from our
results planets of mass 0.5MJ (q = 5.0×10−4 ) would require
the disc viscosity to be ν ' 3.0 − 5.0 × 10−6 to form without creating vortices, depending on the radius at which they
are located. Conversely we find planets as small as 0.1MJ
(q = 1.0 × 10−4 ) can even form at ν = 2.0 × 10−6 without
creating vortices. This can be seen in Figure 8. Hence our
results show that these gaps could be opened by planets of
the masses predicted by Long et al. (2018) without forming
vortices.

5.1.4

DSHARP

Recently results from DSHARP (Disc Substructures at High
Angular Resolution Project) have been published (Andrews
et al. 2018). This is one of the first large programs carried
out using the ALMA telescope. In this project millimetre
emission from a sample of 20 protoplanetary discs was observed with intent to find and characterise substructures,
such as dark gaps and bright rings. It was found that these
substructures are present at almost any radius across the
whole sample of discs. They are significantly more common
than spiral arm structure, occurring in 3 of the discs and
crescent asymmetries, occurring in 2 of the discs. Both of
these additional structures coexist with the dark band substructures present across the sample. Similarly to Long et al.
(2018) it is found that condensation fronts are not a reliable
method of forming these potential gaps (Huang et al. 2018).
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

9

Zhang et al. (2018) analyse 14 discs from this sample, in
which a total of 19 gaps are present. Relations between gap
width/depth and planet/disc properties are found using two
dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including dust particles for a range of disc aspect ratios, turbulent viscosities and
planet masses appropriate to the sample. These relations are
then used to infer the planet mass from the intensity profiles
of Huang et al. (2018). However, only 12 of these gaps are
wide enough to be fit using their fitting formula, whereas
the remainder are fitted by eye. Hence, we will focus our
comparison here on the more robustly fit sample of 12.
The predicted planet masses listed in Zhang et al.
(2018) clearly highlight the degeneracy we are attempting
to address. Not only does the planet mass differ depending on which turbulent viscosity is assumed but also the
assumed dust size distribution. This results in between 3
and 9 possible planet masses that can explain each gap.
While our results can do nothing to address the degeneracy arising from the assumed dust size distribution, we
can make some predictions based on the turbulent viscosity. The turbulent viscosities assumed in their analysis are
α = 10−4 , 10−3 and 10−2 (ν = 2.5 × 10−7 , ×10−6 and
×10−5 respectively). For each of these viscosities the predicted masses range from 0.01 − 1.06MJ , 0.03 − 2.16MJ and
0.06 − 4.41MJ (q(1MJ ) = 1.0 × 10−3 ) respectively in the axisymmetric discs. The aspect ratios of their discs range from
h = 0.04 − 0.09. We perform a general overall comparison
using a disc lifetime of 1Myr (Andrews et al. 2018), h = 0.05
and R = 10 − 100AU as the locations of the gaps for our
comparison. Using this our results show that in the lowest
viscosity case, planets of up to 0.025MJ (q = 2.5 × 10−5 )
can form without creating vortices and in the middle viscosity case planets of up to 0.36MJ (q = 3.6 × 10−4 ) can form
without creating vortices. In this case the lowest viscosity
prediction requires some extrapolation to make as this viscosity lies outside the domain of our results. Similarly, the
highest viscosity case is significantly outside the domain of
our results, such that it is difficult to make meaningful extrapolations towards. At the edge of our results domain, at
ν = 10−5 , planets of up to 2.0MJ (q = 2.0 × 10−3 ) can form
without creating vortices. These are the maximum masses in
each case, which corresponds to the smallest radial location
of the gap and increasing the radial location will reduce the
mass of a planet that can form. In general for the lower viscosities this mass reduction is very small. Hence, our results
provide a limit which can rule out the low viscosity, high
planet mass cases.
Finally we must address the point that two of the
discs in this sample (HD143006 and HD163296) show asymmetries and hence require a slightly different analysis. In
HD143006 the asymmetry lies beyond the continuum disc
edge and such is not a direct analogue to our gap edge vortices. However, this disc is predicted to contain a planet of
mass ≈ 2 − 40MJ (q = 2 − 40 × 10−3 ) dependent on the degeneracies listed above, which would be impossible to form
without creating vortices according to our results. The asymmetry in HD163296 is more consistent with those we see in
our simulations, occurring at the R = 48AU gap in this disc.
Using this gap location and an age of 10Myr (Andrews et al.
2018) we find that all of the predicted masses 0.54 − 4.45MJ
(q = 0.54 − 4.45 × 10−3 ) across the above degeneracies will
not be able to form without creating vortices. The only po-

10

Hallam & Paardekooper

tential exception to this is in the high viscosity case, which
suffers from the same extrapolation problem as in the comparison above. At ν = 10−5 it is already possible for their
smallest predicted planet to form while retaining axisymmetry, for their highest viscosity. This parameter space will very
likely become larger as the viscosity increases. Nevertheless,
the overall agreement with this disc is very good.
Another very interesting result from the analysis of
Zhang et al. (2018) is for the specific case of the disc AS209
which contains axisymmetric gaps at 9, 24, 35, 62, 90, 105
and 137AU. They find that a planet of mass q = 1.0 × 10−4
at R = 100AU in a disc with α = 10−5 (ν = 2.5 × 10−8 ) and
h = 0.05 can very well explain both position and amplitude
of the 24, 35, 62, 90 and 105AU gaps. The age of this disc is
1Myr (Andrews et al. 2018). Again we must extrapolate as
the viscosity is so small, but unfortunately from our results
it is very clear that a planet of this mass would not be able
to form in these conditions without also creating vortices.
Interestingly, despite reproducing well the location and amplitude their results also show some asymmetry in the disc
substructure. This is overcome by using a radially varying
turbulent viscosity, which also provides a better fit to the
observations. Hence, this is something that may need to be
considered.
5.2

elongated vortex forming as a result of a planet growing in
the disc. Fung & Dong (2015); Dong & Fung (2017); Cazzoletti et al. (2018) show that these phenomena could possibly
be explained by a planet of 5.0MJ (q = 5.0 × 10−3 ) situated
between the bright ring and the asymmetry. For standard
disc lifetimes 1 − 10Myr and viscosity ν on the order of a
few 10−6 we can confirm from Equation 7 that forming such
a massive planet at this location will create vortices. Also
particularly interestingly Cazzoletti et al. (2018) show that,
by using the results of Rosotti et al. (2016); Facchini et al.
(2018), the gap between these features can be explained by
a 0.2MJ (q = 2.0 × 10−4 ) planet at 68AU with a viscosity
of α = 10−3 (ν = 2.5 × 10−6 ). In this situation the planet
is not massive enough to explain the spiral arms, hence is
not a result that explains all of the features in the disc. Our
results show the formation of this planet should not create
vortices for ages 1 − 10Myr. This is interesting, as while it
has been predicted that a planet of this mass could form
the gap we see, both our results and the analysis by Cazzoletti et al. (2018) predict that this planet could not form the
additional features present in this disc. This is an example
of using our results to rule out a planet of a certain mass
as an explanation for a gap in a disc, despite this planet
being a reasonable candidate when a large number of disc
parameters are unknowns.

Non-axisymmetric discs
5.2.3

5.2.1

There are many observational examples of discs containing
vortices that could potentially be the result of planet disc
interactions (e.g. van der Marel et al. 2013; Isella et al. 2013;
Fukagawa et al. 2013; Pérez et al. 2014; Marino et al. 2015;
Kraus et al. 2017; Dong et al. 2018; Cazzoletti et al. 2018).
These are also particularly interesting cases to us as, similarly to the HL Tau and TW Hydrae cases, allow us to make
tentative predictions about the planets in these systems. van
der Marel et al. (2013) investigate the disc surrounding the
young A type star Oph IRS 48, in which a dust trap is located between 45 and 80AU at the edge of an inner cavity.
They suggest a planet of mass ≈ 10MJ (q = 1.0 × 10−2 ) located at 20AU could explain this and that the dust trap at
the edge of the cavity could be a vortex arising from the excitation of the Rossby wave instability. In their simulations,
they use an α = 10−4 (ν = 2.5 × 10−7 ) and an h = 0.05
at the location of the planet. This aspect ratio is consistent
with our investigation, however their disc is flaring. From
Equation 7 we can see that attempting to form such a massive planet over standard young disc lifetimes (1 − 5Myr)
will always result in vortices.
5.2.2

MWC758

Oph IRS 48

HD135344B

The disc surrounding the Herbig Ae/Be star HD135344B
(Pérez et al. 2014; Cazzoletti et al. 2018) shows interesting phenomena. This disc contains a cavity with a radius
of ≈ 50AU at the edge of which is a bright ring of material. At 80AU there is a crescent asymmetry. The disc also
contains two bright spiral arms extending out to ≈ 75AU.
This disc is also particularly interesting as it is currently
the only observational result we have that shows the features identified by Hammer et al. (2019), pertaining to an

Another system of interest surrounds the Herbig Ae/Be star
MWC758 (Marino et al. 2015; Dong et al. 2018). This star is
3.7±2Myr old and has a cavity of radius 50AU in which there
is the possibility of a low mass companion. The outer disc
extends to ≈ 100AU with two clumps at 50 and 85AU. Dong
et al. (2018) postulate that a 5 − 10MJ (q = 5 − 10 × 10−3 )
planet at 100AU could be the cause of this (Dong et al.
2015). Once again for a reasonable range of disc viscosities,
using the age of the star as an upper limit we find from
Equation 7 that attempting to form a planet this massive at
this radius will create vortices.
5.3

Concluding Remarks

The majority of our investigation has been undertaken assuming a constant disc aspect ratio h = 0.05, however as
discussed in Section 4.4 we have investigated the effect of
varying this parameter. As the results discussed here are
observational, it is very difficult to know the aspect ratios of
the discs in question. As a result predictions made regarding
masses of gap opening planets will often assume the value
of h. Our investigation into the aspect ratio shows that a
thicker disc will tend to be more stable, for the same viscosity and planet mass. Therefore, should the discs in these observations have a larger aspect ratio than has been assumed
(or the assumed aspect ratio is greater than h = 0.05) the
planet masses and viscosities could be larger before vortices
are created. This also means that if we predict a planet of
a given mass can form in a disc without causing vortices to
appear, then that same planet can still form without creating vortices if the disc’s aspect ratio was larger than we
assumed.
The findings from our results and the predictions regarding the above systems is twofold. Firstly it is apparent
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

Disc structure and planet mass
that given our relation and for reasonable ranges of disc viscosity and age, several MJ planets will always create vortices
in the disc during their formation. Hence in these discs we
have observed, if we expect to see a planet of multiple MJ
in these discs we should also expect to find asymmetries.
Secondly, our results show that vortices are formed for planets significantly smaller than multiple MJ for low viscosities.
This implies that, in systems observationally showing signs
of vortices, the planets may not be as giant as we previously expected. Hence, vortices in discs may not be a tracer
of multiple MJ mass planets, instead they could show the
presence of planets with masses in the sub-Saturn range,
down to even only a few Neptune masses. In addition, the
absence of vortices in low viscosity discs implies that if any
planets exist in the disc, they must be very low mass.

DISCUSSION

Our results and the above conclusion are still very tentative.
We have made a number of assumptions in our simulations
that could have some impact on the validity of our main result, in addition to the aforementioned errors. We will justify
and discuss these assumptions here.
We make no statements regarding how these planets
could form at these locations within the disc. We use a
very simplified method of growing the planet mass over a
timescale, discussed in Section 2.2, that does not take into
account any particular formation mechanism. There are two
main theories as to how giant planets form in protoplanetary discs, the core accretion and gravitational instability
theories (Pollack et al. 1996; Boss 1997; Helled et al. 2014),
both of which contain their own problems that can be difficult to solve. In neither case do we expect the growth of the
planet to follow Equation 4. However, we expect that it is
the growth timescale that is the most important parameter
in determining whether the gap edge becomes unstable and
any method of planet formation will have a corresponding
growth timescale.
We also assume our planet does not migrate in the disc.
Planet migration would clearly impact the planet formation
process, as it is more difficult to form giant planets at large
radial distances in the disc. As we expect planets to migrate
inwards this means that it will be easier to form giant planets
as the migrating planet approaches the warmer, more dense
regions of the disc. Again, similarly to planet formation there
are different regimes of planet migration through which a
planet will progress as its mass increases. These are Type I
migration for low mass planets (Goldreich & Tremaine 1980)
and Type II migration for more massive, gap opening planets
(Lin & Papaloizou 1986). As a planet grows it will initially
migrate at high speed via Type I migration until it begins to
open a gap in the disc and transfers to Type II migration, at
which this speed will be reduced (Ward 1997). Despite this
reduction in migration rate the predicted Type II migration
rate is still shorter than the lifetime of the disc, implying
that most planets undergoing Type II migration will be absorbed by the central star (Hasegawa & Ida 2013). This is
problematic for planet formation models, as observational
evidence dictates that gas giant planets are more common
at orbital distances R > 1AU (Mayor et al. 2011; Cassan
et al. 2012; Fressin et al. 2013; Santerne et al. 2016). Which

could not occur if this predicted timescale is correct. Current
models predict that giant planets must form at R > 20AU
to survive this migration (Coleman & Nelson 2014). Hence
it is expected that something is limiting the rate of Type II
migration (Nelson et al. 2000). Due to its complex nature,
we neglect planet migration in this initial study and leave
accounting for it to future work.
The impact of the Rossby wave instability on migrating planets is still largely unexplored, however, there has
been some recent investigation into its effects (McNally et al.
2019). As the planet’s wake migrates with the planet, the
effect of the shock will be more spread out over the disc,
possibly leading to a gap edge that is less steep. Hence, it
is possible that the migration of the planet may act to suppress the Rossby wave instability. Additionally, the relation
between gap opening and planet migration is not well understood. It has been shown that for a migrating planet to
open a gap, the gap formation timescale must be shorter
than the migration timescale, otherwise a gap will not be
formed (Malik et al. 2015). This can be difficult considering
the rapid rate of planet migration. Also, growing a planet in
the disc will cause the gap formation timescale to be longer
than if the planet was initialised at its final mass. If the
migrating planet cannot open a gap, then the Rossby wave
instability will not be excited as no steep gap edge is formed.
Nevertheless, it has been shown that migrating giant planets can still open gaps in the disc material (Crida & Bitsch
2017).
In addition to our simplistic approach to planet growth
and migration, the systems we simulate are significantly less
complex than those we are comparing our results to. We use
a constant viscosity across our disc and hold our planets on
a circular orbit with zero eccentricity. Most importantly we
only consider a single planet within the disc, whereas observationally we often see tracers of multiple planets, such
as the multiple dark bands in both HL Tau and TW Hydrae. However, in discs such as HL Tau the dark bands are
far apart, so that if they were gaps formed by planets we
can safely treat them as seperate entities. Also, the vortices
formed as a result of instability excitation in our simulations
always occurs on the outer edge of the gap formed by the
planet. This is often the case in observational results, but
not always as we can also see vortices formed at the edge
of cavities and also interior to the planet. This should have
little implication for comparison with our results, but shows
that there are differences between our simulations and the
systems we observe.
We perform our simulations using a simplified, locally
isothermal equation of state. In further work we intend to extend this investigation to a non-isothermal equation of state,
using a cooling timescale. However, when considering nonisothermal discs, the cooling timescale is a parameter that
is difficult to estimate as it is dependent on disc opacity.
The cooling timescale can be chosen to ensure initial equilibrium between (viscous) heating and cooling (e.g. Pierens
& Lin 2018). More realistic cooling prescriptions can be constructed under the same assumption (e.g. Faure et al. 2015).
Another factor that may impact the validity of our comparisons with observational results is that we simulate only
the gas in the disc, while observationally we can only view
the emission from the dust in the disc. This means that unless the dust and gas behave very similarly there may be

12

Hallam & Paardekooper

some difference between our predictions and observations.
It is already known that it is easier to form gaps in dust
than in the gas (Paardekooper & Mellema 2004), therefore
it is possible that gaps we see from observational results may
still contain gas.
We make no predictions concerning the lifetime of the
vortices arising as the result of instability excitation in
our simulations. We find that some vortices formed during
planet growth will mostly disperse before the simulation has
elapsed, but in other cases vortices will still be present when
the simulation has been finished. We note that the lifetime
of a vortex is difficult to predict. There are a number of
factors that can reduce the lifetime of vortices, such as the
viscosity (de Val-Borro et al. 2007; Ataiee et al. 2013; Fu
et al. 2014a; Regály et al. 2017), dust feedback (Johansen
et al. 2004; Inaba & Barge 2006; Lyra et al. 2009; Fu et al.
2014b), disc self gravity (Regály & Vorobyov 2017a; Pierens
& Lin 2018) and the streaming instability (Raettig et al.
2015). The lifetimes of vortices formed by giant planets has
been investigated and were found to be strongly dependent
on planet mass and viscosity, capable of sustaining vortices
up to 104 orbits in some cases (Fu et al. 2014a). It has also
been shown that dust build up in vortices can act to speed
up their dispersion (Railton & Papaloizou 2014). Vortices
in protoplanetary discs are very efficient at trapping dust
(Barge & Sommeria 1995), however the dust feedback can
destroy the vortex if the dust density becomes too large.
This occurs due to the excitement of a dynamical instability
which destroys the potential vorticity minimum, a prerequisite for sustaining the vortex. Hence when this is removed
the vortex quickly dissipates (Fu et al. 2014b). It has also
been shown that a dust vortex will live longer than a gas
vortex, hence after the gas vortex dissipates we expect to
still see asymmetries in the dust. The lifetime of asymmetries in the dust can be four times longer than those in the
gas (Fu et al. 2014b). As our simulations only consider the
gas in the disc, it is possible that the vortices in the dust
would be observable for a longer period. However, it is also
possible that the vortices would dissipate faster if we considered their tendency to trap dust. If a brightness asymmetry
exists in an observation, we know there is the potential for
a vortex to exist and can use this to constrain the mass of
any potential planets in the disc. If we do not see a potential
vortex, then we can use their absence to constrain the mass
of any potential planets in the disc. However, we must be
aware that it is possible for a vortex to have existed earlier in the disc’s lifetime and has since dissipated. This is
an unfortunate consequence of only being able to observe
a disc at a single point during its evolution. Additionally,
dust enhancement of vortices can make these vortices more
visible in the dust than in the gas. As we have discussed,
observational results show the dust in the disc, whereas our
simulations represent the gas in the disc. Therefore, it is possible that weak vortices in our simulations could correspond
to more visible vortices after accounting for dust enhancement. Hence, we have been particularly careful analysing
marginal cases with weak vortices in establishing the planet
growth timescale at which vortices disappear.
Finally, we do not include any effects of disc self gravity
in our model. However, it is known that disc self gravity can
have major effects on vortex formation and lifetime (Regály
& Vorobyov 2017a). It is also known that the indirect poten-

tial caused by a vortex can aid the onset of the Rossby wave
instability (Regály & Vorobyov 2017b). Hence, our results
are not applicable to massive discs for which self gravity becomes important, but this would be an interesting direction
to take this study.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have derived a relation between the viscosity of a disc and the mass of planets forming in this disc
as a function of the growth timescale of the planet. We intend this relation to help break the degeneracy in planet
masses and viscosities that can adequately explain observed
gaps in protoplanetary discs. If both of these parameters are
unknown then almost any gap can have a planetary explanation. Using this relation we can make predictions regarding the mass of planets in protoplanetary discs in which we
observationally detect the presence of absence of vortices,
assuming standard disc ages and viscosities. We find that
our results are consistent with predictions made regarding a
variety of observations, both for discs containing and devoid
of vortices, including well documented discs such as HL Tau
(ALMA Partnership et al. 2015) and TW Hydrae (Andrews
et al. 2016). However, we must stress that our relation is
very tentative and is by no means a definitive prediction,
due to both the inherent inaccuracies in the method it was
derived and the assumptions made in our simulations.
Furthermore, using our relation we can make the prediction that it is not necessary for planets to have masses
on the order of one Jupiter mass to form vortices within low
viscosity discs. While massive planets do indeed form these
vortices, the onset of them occurs for planets that are significantly less massive, for acceptable disc viscosities and ages.
We find that planets of sub-Saturn mass can form vortices,
down to a few Neptune masses. Whether or not planets of
these low masses can explain the dark bands we see in many
of these observations is a different question. We are in no
way precluding giant Jupiter mass planets from being the
cause of these, however this prediction must be something
to keep in mind, especially as we delve deeper into attempting to directly image these planets within their gaps. We
also hope that our results are a step on the way to breaking
the degeneracy in planetary explanations for observational
gaps, by imposing limits on the mass of the planet and/or
the viscosity of the disc based on the presence or absence of
vortices in the disc.
