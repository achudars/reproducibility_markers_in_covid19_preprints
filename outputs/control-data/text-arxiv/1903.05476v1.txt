Abstract: In this paper, we first use the “complexity equals action” conjecture to
discuss the complexity growth rate in both perturbation Einsteinian cubic gravity and
non-perturbation Einstein-Weyl gravity. We find that the CA complexity rate in these
cases is divergent. To avoid this divergence, we modify the original conjecture, where
we assume that the complexity of the boundary state equals the boundary actions
contributed by the null segments as well as the joints of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch.
Then, the late time growth rate of this modified holographic complexity is given by
entropy S times temperature T , which is quite in agreement with the circuit analysis.
Finally, to test its rationality, we also investigate the switchback effect by evaluating it
in a Vaidya geometry and analyze the results in circuit models.

Introduction

Recently, applications of quantum information concepts to high energy physics and
gravity have led to many promising results. Among all, it has become more clear that
special properties of entanglement in holographic quantum field theories are account for
the emergence of smooth higher-dimensional geometries in gauge-gravity duality[1–4].
This faith inspired a further deeper idea that “ER=EPR”[3] when consider a nontraversable wormhole created by an Einstein-Rosen (ER)[5] bridge and a pair of maximally entangled black holes, based on the point of view that a black hole might be
highly entangled with a system that is effectively infinitely far away. EPR denotes
the quantum entanglement (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox). However, recent developments pointed out that holographic entanglement is unable to describe the bulk
spacetime far behind the event horizon of black holes [6]. Hence there must exist some
other quantity we yet do not know which have the information about internal of black
hole. And it has been suggested by Susskind and collaborators that this quantity
is the quantum computational complexity of the boundary state, which presents the
minimum number of elementary operations or gates from a reference state to a target
state.
There are two related proposals conjectured to capture the complexity of the boundary state in holography: “complexity equals volume” (CV) [7, 8] and “complexity equals

action” (CA) [9, 10]. These conjectures have attracted many researchers to investigate
the properties of both holographic complexity and circuit complexity in quantum field
theory, e.g.,[11–51] In this paper, we only focus on the CA conjecture, which states
that the complexity of a particular state |ψ(tL , tR )i on the AdS boundary is given by
C (|ψ(tL , tR )i) ≡

IWDW
,
π~

(1.1)

where IWDW is the on-shell action in the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch,
which is enclosed by the past and future light sheets sent into the bulk spacetime from
the timeslices tL and tR . As argued in [52], there is a bound of the complexity growth
rate of a system of energy E at the late time
2E
C˙ ≤
,
π~

(1.2)

which may be thought of as the Lloyd’s bound on the quantum complexity. Although
some recent developments have cast the exact prefactor of this bound into question, it
is not difficult to believe that, for any system, the quantum complexity should always
have a finite growth rate.
Recently, Nally [53] investigated the CA conjecture in some stringy modes of higher
curvature gravity where the general relativity is perturbed by higher powers of the
Riemann tensor. Their results suggest that, once stringy effects are taken into account,
the neutral black hole will have a divergent complexity growth rate under the first
leading order correction. One of the reasonable interpretations mentioned by the author
is that, in the CA picture, the complexity growth rate is a nonanalytic function of
the small coupling parameter. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate whether the
similar divergences would be found in the non-perturbation higher curvature theories.
According to the calculation in next section, we find that the CA complexity rate is
also divergent in the non-perturbtion Einstein-Weyl gravity. This apparent failure of
the CA conjecture motivates us to re-define the holographic complexity such that the
complexity growth rate is convergent when the higher curvature term is concerned.
Another motivation for the present paper is from the discussion of the quantum
circuit model. By studying a simple class of systems known as random quantum circuits
with N qubits, it has been shown that for generic circuits, after a short period of
transient initial behavior, the complexity grows linearly in time, and finally saturates
at a maximum value. In the context of the AdS/CFT, we need set N to be very large.
Then, it can be generally argued that at the late times, this quantum complexity should
continue to grow with a rate given by[7, 8]

where the entropy represents the width of the circuit and the temperature is an obvious
choice for the local rate at which a particular qubit interacts. And in high temperature
limit, this feature is held in the CA context. However, we also hope that this feature
is held even at low temperature regimes.
The remainder of our paper is organized as follows: In Sec.2, we first review the
results in [53], and then study the CA conjecture in both perturbed Einsteinian cubic
gravity and non-perturbation Einstein-Weyl gravity. In Sec.3, in order to avoid the
divergence mentioned in Sec.2, we modify the CA conjecture and investigate its time
involution as well as the switchback effect for a general higher curvature gravitational
theory. Finally, we conclude our paper in Sec.4.

CA complexity for higher curvature gravity

In [53], Nally studied the holographic complexity with CA conjecture for higher curvature gravitational theories which are directly motivated by string theory. In this
case, string theory naturally comes equipped with an infinite tower of correction to the
general relativity. And then, the corresponding bulk action can be expressed as
!

I = dd+2 x −g R − 2Λ +
α n Ln ,
(2.1)
n=1

–3–

where Ln is in general an n-th order polynomial in the Riemann tensor and possibly
the gauge fields. After the calculation on a 5-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet as well as
Weyl gravitational theories, they found that the holographic complexity is extremely
sensitive to singularity effects and the leading CA complexity growth rate is divergent
at the late times. And this divergence comes from the singularity. However, the Lloyd
bound suggests that any system, even if it has an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
should have a finite complexity growth rate. Then, if the CA conjecture should prove
correct in these perturbation gravitation theory, the complexity growth rate must be
a nonanalytic function of the small parameter α. This means that when all of the
corrections is concerned, the CA complexity growth rate will be convergent. Therefore,
it is also necessary to study whether these similar divergences would be found in a
non-perturbation higher curvature theory. To better understand the divergences of the
CA complexity growth rate, we next consider both the perturbation Einsteinian cubic
gravity and non-perturbation Einstein-Weyl gravity.
2.1

Perturbation Einsteinian cubic gravity

In this subsection, we consider a 4-dimensional Einsteinian cubic gravity. As shown in

Here Θ̂ = ∇a (k a Ψ̂) = √1σ ∂λ (Ψ̂ σ) and Θ = ∇a k a = √1σ ∂λ ( σ) is the expansion scalar

With similar consideration as [53], here we also treat λ as a small parameter, i.e.,
the cubed terms are regarded as a small correction to Einstein gravity. Then, we can
obtain the Schwarzschild-AdS-type black hole solution at the first subleading, whose
line element can be shown as [56]

Then, let us evaluate complexity growth rate with the CA conjecture. As illustrated
in the Penrose diagram of the SAdS-type spacetime Fig.1, I(tL , tR ), denoted as the
action for the WDW patch determined by the time slice on the left and right AdS
boundaries, is invariant under the time translation I(tL + δt, tR − δt) = I(tL , tR ). Thus
the action growth can be computed as δI = I(t0 + δt, t1 ) − I(t0 , t1 ), where the time on
the right boundary has been fixed. To regulate the divergence near the AdS boundary,
a cut-off surface r = rΛ is introduced. In addition, we also introduce a spacelike surface
r =  to avoid running into the spacelike singularity inside of this neutral black hole.
As such, we shall focus on the situation in which the boundary consists solely of null
and spacelike segments only with spacelike joints. In addition, for simplicity we shall
adopt the affine parameter for the null generator of null segments such that the surface
term vanishes for null segments. With these in mind, we have
δI = IδM + IΣ + IδC + δIct .

(2.9)

with IδM = IM1 − IM2 and IδC = IC1 − IC2 . Here M1 is bounded by u = t0 , u =
t0 + δt,v = t0 + δt, and r = rmin . M2 is bounded by u = t0 , v = t0 , v = v0 + δt, and
u = t1 . The null coordinates are defined as u = t + r∗ (r) and v = t − r∗ (r) with

limit of the complexity growth rate approaches 2M/π~. We can see that this new
conjecture will give a convergent holographic complexity growth rate. Moreover, we
also need to check whether it also gives expected properties such that it can be regarded
as a complexity. To show this, next, we first evaluate the growth rate of this modified
complexity in a SAdS-type spacetime, and then check its switchback effect of this
modified conjecture.

surface term will vanish. Therefore, we only need consider the counterterm contributions. By the translation symmetry, there are only two null segments contributing to
the action growth. According to the line element (3.2), one can further obtain Θ = d/r.

Switchback effect

The switchback effect is an important property for the holographic complexity. It is
related the complexity of precursor operators. In this section, to test our conjecture

– 10 –

by examining this feature, we consider a Vaidya black hole with thin shell of null fluid
collapses in a higher curvature gravitational theory. If we only focus on the light shock
wave case, then the black hole’s event horizon will shift by a small amount, i.e., we
have
rh,2
= 1+δ,
(3.12)

where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the quantities before and after the shock wave,
individually. Then, the scrambling time can be expressed as

ln .

t∗scr =

(3.13)

For the dual quantum system of this black hole, there are two typical regions which
are divided by the scrambling time t = t∗scr after a perturbation is introduced. For
t < t∗scr , the complexity remains essentially unchanged, while for t > t∗scr , it begins to
grow linearly. And our goal in this subsection is to investigate whether this feature can
be preserved in our modified CA conjecture.
Following the similar analysis and notation in [57, 58], the line element of this shock
wave geometry can be written as
ds2 = −F (r, v)dv 2 + 2drdv + r2 dΣ2k,d

(3.14)

with the blackening factor
F (r, v) = f2 (r)H(v + tw ) + f1 (r) [1 − H(v + tw )] ,

(3.15)

and here we set rh,2 > rh,1 . This line element describes an infinitely thin shell collapse
which generates a shape transition from a SAdS-type black hole with horizon r = rh,1
to another one with r = rh,2 .
For the convenience of later calculations, we would like to introduce the tortoise
coordinates as

(r) → 0. Using these coordinates, one can also define an
“outgoing” null coordinate u and auxiliary time coordinate t as
ui ≡ v − 2ri∗ (r),

ti ≡ v − ri∗ (r) .

– 11 –

(3.17)

The switchback effect is revealed in the “complexity of formation” of the boundary
thermofield double state (TFD), which is the extra complexity required to prepare the
two copies of the fermionic field theory in the TFD state compared to simply preparing
each of the copies in the vacuum state, i.e.,
∆C = C (|TFDi) − C (|0iL ⊗ |0iR )

(3.18)

In the context of AdS/CFT, the holographic calculation is to evaluate the complexity
at tL = tR = 0 for the black hole and subtract that for two copies of the AdS vacuum
geometry. Therefore, in the following, it is sufficient to restrict our attention to the
case tL = tR = 0. In order to show the switchback effect for the modified conjecture,
next, we consider the derivative of the complexity of formation with respect to tw (the
slope of the complexity of formation). And since the holographic complexity for the
AdS vacuum geometry is time-independent, the slope of complexity of formation can
be expressed as
d∆Cmod
dCmod
=
dtw
dtw

(3.19)

To examine the switchback effect, next we consider two limit regions t  t∗scr and
t  t∗scr . For the region tw  t∗scr , by considering the shift symmetry and the light
shock wave condition f1 ' f2 , the complexity of formation will vanish, i.e.,
d∆Cmod
dtw

=0

(3.20)

tw t∗scr

For another region tw  t∗scr , one can verify that all of the light sheets will sent into
singularity. And the geometry of the WDW patch is characterized by the dynamical
points: rs and rb , the point where the null shell crosses the past right and future left
boundaries. By using the tortoise coordinates, these positions yield
tw + 2r2∗ (rs ) = 0 ,

tw + 2r1∗ (rb ) = 0 .

(3.21)

Then, the derivative of these dynamical points with respect to tw is given by

Following the standard prescription proposed by [57, 58], we shall apply the affine
parameter for null generator of null segments. As a consequence, the contributions from
the corners at rs/b , as well as all of the null segments will vanish. By considering the
symmetries of this spacetime, the time-dependent contributions only comes from the

– 12 –

counter terms of the past right and future left null boundaries. We first consider the
past right segment of the WDW patch, the relevant null normals to these boundaries
can be defined as

ka = H(r, v) −(dv)a +

with affine parameters, where we denote
H(r, v) = α2 H(r − rs ) + α1 [1 − H (r − rs )] .

(3.24)

By demanding that the null boundary is affinely parameterized across the shock wave,
we have[57]

(3.25)

Meanwhile, we will fix the parameter in infinity, i.e., we fix α2 when we change the

shock wave tw . Due to k a = ∂λ
, one can obtain dr/dλ = H(r, v). Then, by using
the expressions of Θ and Θ̂, one can further obtain

In order to study the switchback effect, next, we consider the light shock wave case, i.e.,
the null shell only injects a small amount of energy into the system. In this situation,
we have f1 ' f2 . Then, Eq. (3.32) becomes

(3.33)

This result is in agreement with the switchback effect which has been illustrated in
the previous literatures [58, 59] for the CA conjecture.
To be specific, in Fig.3, we present the slope of the complexity of formation for a
light shock wave in BTZ black hole for Einstein gravity. We can see that there exists
a scrambling time t∗scr which is characterized by the energy of the shock wave. And
the slope is approximately zero until the t ' t∗scr at which point it rapidly rises to the
final constant value. This implies that for the order of the scrambling time t∗scr , the
complexity of formation is same as the case of unperturbed state, and in the regime of
tw > t∗scr , it grows linearly with respect to the time tw .

Circuit analogy

In this subsection, we would like to investigate the connection between the behaviours
of our holographic results and the switchback effect of the circuit model. As discussed
in [8, 58], evolving the perturbed state independently in the left and right times yield
the expression
|T F D(tL , tR )ipert = UR (tR + tw )OR UR (tL − tw )|T F Di ,

Figure 3: The derivative of the complexity of formation with respect to tw for the BTZ
geometry, where we set L = 1, ω1 = 1, and the dishes lines describe the corresponding
scrambling time t = t∗scr .
where the perturbed operator OR is a localized simple operator. UR (t)OR UR (−t) = I
with the identity operator I when t < t∗scr . This feature is connected to the switchback
effect[8, 60] and can provide a deeper explanation of our holographic results.
We denote the rate of the complexity to c1 before the operator OR is inserted and
c2 after it[58]. Under the limit of light shock, according to (3.10), we have
c1 ≈ c2 ≈

2dT S
(d + 1)π~

(3.34)

First of all, we consider the case tw < t∗scr . When tL < tw , the process in (3.34)
can be illustrated in (b) of Fig.4. In this situation, the switchback effect produces a
cancellation for the process below the dashed line. Therefore, the complexity is given
by
Cpert ≈

2dT St
,
(d + 1)π~

(3.35)

where we set tL = tR = t/2. One can note that this complexity is exactly the result of
the eternal case where the cancellation is always valid for the process below the dashed
line. When tL > tw , the process can be illustrated by (c) in Fig.4. We can see that
there is no opportunity for the switchback effect. Hence, the complexity is also the
result of the eternal case which can be described by (3.35). As a summary, we find

that when tw < t∗scr , by virtue of the switch back effect, the complexity is same as that
of the unperturbed state.
Then, we consider the case tw > t∗scr . When tL − tw > −t∗scr , the complexity shares
the same result with the case tw < t∗scr . When tw − tL > t∗scr , the process can be
illustrated by (a) in Fig.4. In this case, the two time-evolution operators cancel out
only during the scrambling time. Therefore, the complexity can be written as
Cpert ≈

4dT S
(tw − t∗scr ) .
(d + 1)π~

(3.36)

This result shows that the growth rate is very close to zero in the region t < 2(tw − t∗scr ).
Next, we consider the complexity of formation. By setting t = 0 an using the above
equations, one can obtain
d∆Cpert
4dT S
≈
H(tw − t∗scr ) .
dtw
(d + 1)π~

(3.37)

Again, this formula also matchs the our holographic case as illustrated in the last
subsection in which when t < t∗scr , the rate of the complexity of formation is close to
zero, and when t > t∗scr , it remains constant.

Conclusion

It has been found that the CA complexity growth rate is divergent when a higher
curvature correction is taken into account[53]. To better understand the divergences
in the CA conjecture, we studied both the perturbation Einsteinian cubic gravity and
non-perturbation Einstein-Weyl gravity. And we found that these divergences can also
be found in the non-perturbation theory. In order to obtain expected properties of
the holographic complexity, we modified the CA conjecture, where we assume that the
complexity of the boundary state equals the boundary actions contributed by the null
segments as well as the joints of the WDW patch. Then, we can see this modified holographic complexity will be convergent. As a candidate of the boundary complexity, it
is necessary to check whether it also gives expected properties as the circuit complexity,
such as the late time growth rate and switchback effect. Therefore, in Sec.3.1, we first
calculate the complexity growth in a SAdS-type spacetime for a general higher curvature gravity. And the late time growth rate of this modified holographic complexity
is proportional to T S, which is quite in agreement with circuit analysis, where the
entropy represents the width of the circuit and the temperature is an obvious choice for
the local rate. Hence, at this point, our conjecture is suitable for describing the circuit
complexity of the boundary state. Finally, we also investigate the switchback effect of
this new conjecture in Vaidya geometry. And we found that our result is actually in
agreement with the switchback effect which has been illustrated in the previous literatures for the original CA conjecture, although here all of the contributions at late time
comes from the counterterms of the null boundary.
