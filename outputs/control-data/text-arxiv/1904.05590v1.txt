Introduction

Matrix recovery problem concerns the construction of a matrix from incomplete
information of its entries. This problem has a wide range of applications such
as recommendation systems with incomplete information of users‚Äô ratings or
sensor localization problem with partially observed distance matrices (see, e.g.,
[3]). In these applications, the matrix is usually known to be (approximately)
low-rank. Finding these low-rank matrices are theoretically difficult due to their
non-convex properties. Computationally, it is important to study the tractability
of these problems given the large scale of datasets considered in practical applications. Recht et al. [11] studied the low-rank matrix recovery problem using a
convex relaxation approach which is tractable. More precisely, in order to recover
a low-rank matrix X ‚àà Rm√ón which satisfy A(X) = b, where the linear map
A : Rm√ón ‚Üí Rp and b ‚àà Rp , b 6= 0, are given, the following convex optimization
problem is proposed:
min kXk‚àó
X
(1)
s.t. A(X) = b,
X
where kXk‚àó =
œÉi (X) is the nuclear norm, the sum of all singular values of
i

restricted isometry conditions of the linear map A. In general, these restricted
isometry conditions are not satisfied and the proposed convex relaxation can fail
to recover the matrix X.
Low-rank matrices appear to be appropriate representations of data in other
applications such as biclustering of gene expression data. Doan and Vavasis [5]
proposed a convex approach to recover low-rank clusters using dual Ky Fan
2-k-norm instead of the nuclear norm. Ky Fan 2-k-norm is defined as

k|A|kk,2 =

k

i=1

where œÉ1 ‚â• . . . œÉk ‚â• 0 are the first k largest singular values of A, k ‚â§ k0 =
rank(A). The dual norm of the Ky Fan 2-k-norm is denoted by k| ¬∑ |k?k,2 ,
k|A|k?k,2 = max hA, Xi

s.t. k|X|kk,2 ‚â§ 1.

These unitarily invariant norms (see, e.g., Bhatia [2]) and their gauge functions
have been used in sparse prediction problems [1], low-rank regression analysis
[6] and multi-task learning regularization [7]. When k = 1, the Ky Fan 2-k-norm
is the spectral norm, kAk = œÉ1 (A), the largest singular value of A, whose dual
norm is the nuclear norm. Similar to the nuclear norm, the dual Ky Fan 2-knorm with k > 1 can be used to compute the k-approximation of a matrix A
(Proposition 2.9, [5]), which demonstrates its low-rank property. Motivated by
this low-rank property of the (dual) Ky Fan 2-k-norm, which is more general than
that of the nuclear norm, and its usage in other applications, in this paper, we
propose a Ky Fan 2-k-norm-based non-convex approach for the matrix recovery
problem which aims to recover matrices which are not recoverable by the convex
relaxation formulation (1). In Section 2, we discuss the proposed models in detail
and in Section 3, we develop numerical algorithms to solve those models. Some
numerical results will also be presented.

Ky Fan 2-k-Norm-Based Models

The Ky Fan 2-k-norm is the `2 -norm of the vector of k largest singular values
with k ‚â§ min{m, n}. Thus we have:

k|A|kk,2 =

k
X

! 21
œÉi2 (A)

i=1

Ô£´

min{m,n}

‚â§ kAkF = Ô£≠

X

Ô£∂ 12
œÉi2 (A)Ô£∏ ,

i=1

where k¬∑k is the Frobenius norm. Now consider the dual Ky Fan 2-k-norm and
use the definition of the dual norm, we obtain the following inequality:
2

kAkF = hA, Ai ‚â§ k|A|k?k,2 ¬∑ k|A|kk,2 .

Thus we have:
k|A|kk,2 ‚â§ kAkF ‚â§ k|A|k?k,2 ,

k ‚â§ min{m, n}.

(4)

It is clear that these inequalities become equalities if and only if rank(A) ‚â§ k. It
shows that to find a low-rank matrix X that satisfies A(X) = b with rank(X) ‚â§
k, we can solve either the following optimization problem
k|X|k?k,2
kXkF
s.t. A(X) = b,

(5)

min k|X|k?k,2 ‚àí kXkF
s.t. A(X) = b.

or

It is straightforward to see that these non-convex optimization problems can be
used to recover low-rank matrices as stated in the following theorem given the
norm inequalities in (4).
Theorem 1. If there exists a matrix X ‚àà Rm√ón such that rank(X) ‚â§ k and
A(X) = b, then X is an optimal solution of (5) and (6).
Given the result in Theorem 1, the exact recovery of a low-rank matrix using
(5) or (6) relies on the uniqueness of the low-rank solution of A(X) = b. Recht
et al. [11] generalized the restricted isometry property of vectors introduced by
CandeÃÄs and Tao [4] to matrices and use it to provide sufficient conditions on the
uniqueness of these solutions.
Definition 1 (Recht et al. [11]). For every integer k with 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ min{m, n},
the k-restricted isometry constant is defined as the smallest number Œ¥k (A) such
that
(1 ‚àí Œ¥k (A)) kXkF ‚â§ kA(X)k2 ‚â§ (1 + Œ¥k (A)) kXkF
(7)
holds for all matrices X of rank at most k.
Using Theorem 3.2 in Recht et al. [11], we can obtain the following exact recovery
result for (5) and (6).
Theorem 2. Suppose that Œ¥2k < 1 and there exists a matrix X ‚àà Rm√ón which
satisfies A(X) = b and rank(X) ‚â§ k, then X is the unique solution to (5) and
(6), which implies exact recoverability.
The condition in Theorem 2 is indeed better than those obtained for the
nuclear norm approach (see, e.g., Theorem 3.3 in Recht et al. [11]). The nonconvex optimization problems (5) and (6) use norm ratio and difference. When
k = 1, the norm ratio and difference are computed between the nuclear and
Frobenius norm. The idea of using these norm ratios and differences with k = 1
has been used to generate non-convex sparse generalizer in the vector case, i.e.,
m = 1. Yin et al. [13] investigated the ratio `1 /`2 while Yin et al. [14] analyzed

4

the difference `1 ‚àí `2 in compressed sensing. Note that even though optimization
formulations based on these norm ratios and differences are non-convex, they
are still relaxations of `0 -norm minimization problem unless the sparsity level
of the optimal solution is s = 1. Our proposed approach is similar to the idea
of the truncated difference of the nuclear norm and Frobenius norm discussed
in Ma et al [8]. Given a parameter t ‚â• 0, the truncated difference is defined

problem of truncated difference minimization can be used to recover matrices
with rank at most k given that kXk‚àó,t‚àíF = 0 if rank(X) ‚â§ t + 1. Similar results
for exact recovery as in Theorem 2 are provided in Theorem 3.7(a) in Ma et al
[8]. Despite the similarity with respect to the recovery results, the problems (5)
and (6) are motivated from a different perspective. We are now going to discuss
how to solve these problems next.

Numerical Algorithm
Difference of Convex Algorithms

We start with the problem (5). It can be reformulated as
2

max kZkF
Z,z

s.t. k|Z|k?k,2 ‚â§ 1,
A(Z) ‚àí z ¬∑ b = 0,
z > 0,

(8)

with the change of variables z = 1/k|X|k?k,2 and Z = X/k|X|k?k,2 . The compact
formulation
2
min Œ¥Z (Z, z) ‚àí kZkF /2,
(9)
Z,z

where Z is the feasible set of the problem (8) and Œ¥Z (¬∑) is the indicator function
of Z. The problem (9) is a difference of convex (d.c.) optimization problem (see,
e.g. [9]). The differnce of convex algorithm DCA proposed in [9] can be applied
to the problem (9) as follows.
Step 1. Start with (Z 0 , z 0 ) = (X 0 /k|X 0 |k?k,2 , 1/k|X 0 |k?k,2 ) for some X 0
such that A(X 0 ) = b and set s = 0.
Step 2. Update (Z s+1 , z s+1 ) as an optimal solution of the following
convex optimization problem
max hZ s , Zi
Z,z

s.t. k|Z|k?k,2 ‚â§ 1
A(Z) ‚àí z ¬∑ b = 0
z > 0.
Step 3. Set s ‚Üê s + 1 and repeat Step 2.

Let X s = Z s /z s and use the general convergence analysis of DCA (see, e.g.,
Theorem 3.7 in [10]), we can obtain the following convergence results.
Proposition 1. Given the sequence {X s } obtained from the DCA algorithm for
the problem (9), the following statements are true.

The convergence results show that the DCA algorithm improves the objective of the ratio minimization problem (5). The DCA algorithm can stop if
(Z s , z s ) ‚àà O(Z s ), where O(Z s ) is the set of optimal solution of 10 and (Z s , z s )
which satisfied this condition is called a critical point. Note that (local) optimal solutions of (9)can be shown to be critical points. The following proposition
shows that an equivalent condition for critical points.
Proposition 2. (Z s , z s ) ‚àà O(Z s ) if and only if Y = 0 is an optimal solution
of the following optimization problem

s.t. A(Y ) = 0.

Proof. Consider Y ‚àà Null(A), i.e., A(Y ) = 0, we then have:

kX s kF

¬∑ hX s , Y i ‚â• k|X s |k?k,2 .

When Y = 0, we achieve the equality. We have: (Z s , z s ) ‚àà O(Z s ) if and only the
above inequality holds for all Y ‚àà Null(A), which means f (Y ; X s ) ‚â• f (0; X s )

for all Y ‚àà Null(A), where f (Y ; X) = k|X + Y |k?k,2 ‚àí

kXkF
it is equivalent to the fact that Y = 0 is an optimal solution of (11).
The result of Proposition 2 shows the similarity between the norm ratio minimization problem (5) and the norm different minimization problem (6) with
respect to the implementation of the DCA algorithm. It is indeed that the problem (6) is a d.c. optimization problem and the DCA algorithm can be applied
as follows.

Step 1. Start with some X 0 such that A(X 0 ) = b and set s = 0.
Step 2. Update X s+1 = X s + Y , where Y is an optimal solution of the
following convex optimization problem
min k|X s + Y |k?k,2 ‚àí
Y

s.t. A(Y ) = 0.

¬∑ hX s , Y i

(12)

Step 3. Set s ‚Üê s + 1 and repeat Step 2.
It is clear that X s is a critical point for the problem (6) if and only if Y is
an optimal solution of (12). Both problems (10) and (12) can be written in the
general form as
min k|X s + Y |k?k,2 ‚àí Œ±(X s ) ¬∑ hX s , Y i
Y
(13)
s.t. A(Y ) = 0,

for (10) and Œ±(X) =

kX s kF
Given that A(X s ) = b, this problem can be written as
where Œ±(X) =

min k|X|k?k,2 ‚àí Œ±(X s ) ¬∑ hX s , Xi
X

s.t. A(X) = b.

(14)

The following proposition shows that X s is a critical point of the problem (14)
for many functions Œ±(¬∑) if rank(X s ) ‚â§ k.
Proposition 3. If rank(X s ) ‚â§ k, X s is a critical point of the problem (14) for
any function Œ±(¬∑) which satisfies
k|X s |k?k,2

‚â§ Œ±(X) ‚â§
2 .
kXkF
kX s kF

(15)

Proof. If rank(X s ) ‚â§ k, we have: Œ±(X s ) = 1/k|X s |kk,2 since k|X s |kk,2 =
kXkF = k|X s |k?k,2 . Given that
‚àÇk|A|k?k,2 = arg

max

hX, Ai,

X:k|X|kk,2 ‚â§1

we have: Œ±(X s )¬∑X s ‚àà ‚àÇk|X s |k?k,2 . Thus for all Y , the following inequality holds:
k|X s + Y |k?k,2 ‚àí k|X s |k?k,2 ‚â• hŒ±(X s ) ¬∑ X s , Y i.
It implies Y = 0 is an optimal solution of the problem (13) since the optimality
condition is
k|X s + Y |k?k,2 ‚àí k|X s |k?k,2 ‚â• hŒ±(X s ) ¬∑ X s , Y i,
Thus X s is a critical point of the problem (14).

‚àÄ Y : A(Y ) = 0.

Proposition 3 shows that one can choose different functions Œ±(¬∑) such as Œ±(X) =
1/k|X|kk,2 for the sub-problem in the general DCA framework to solve the original problem. This generalized sub-problem (14) is a convex optimization problem, which can be formulated as a semidefinite optimization problem given the
following calculation of the dual Ky Fan 2-k-norm provided in [5]:
k|X|k?k,2 = min p + trace(R)
s.t. kp ‚àí trace(P ) = 0,
pI
 ‚àí P  10, T 
P ‚àí2X
 0.
‚àí 12 X R

(16)

In order to implement the DCA algorithm, one also needs to consider how to
find the initial solution X 0 . We can use the nuclear norm minimization problem
1, the convex relaxation of the rank minimization problem, to find X 0 . A similar
approach is to use the following dual Ky Fan 2-k-norm minimization problem to
find X 0 given its low-rank properties:
min k|X|k?k,2

(17)

X

s.t. A(X) = b.

This initial problem can be considered as an instance of (14) with X s = 0 (and
Œ±(0) = 1), which is equivalent to starting the iterative algorithm with X 0 = 0
one step ahead. We are now ready to provide some numerical results.
3.2

Numerical Results

Similar to CandeÃÄs and Recht [3], we construct the following the experiment. We
generate M , an m √ó n matrix of rank r, by sampling two m √ó r and n √ó r factors
M L and M R with i.i.d. Gaussian entries and setting M = M L M R . The linear
map A is constructed with s independent Gaussian matrices Ai whose entries
follows N (0, 1/s), i.e.,
A(X) = b ‚áî hAi , Xi = hAi , M i = bi ,

i = 1, . . . , s.

We generate K = 50 matrix M with m = 50, n = 40, and r = 2. The dimension
of these matrices is dr = r(m+n‚àír) = 176. For each M , we generate s matrices
for the random linear map with s ranging from 180 to 500. We set the maximum
number of iterations of the algorithm to be Nmax = 100. The instances are solved
using SDPT3 solver [12] for semi-definite optimization problems in Matlab. The
computer used for these numerical experiments is a 64-bit Windows 10 machine
with 3.70GHz quad-core CPU, and 32GB RAM. The performance measure is the
kX ‚àí M kF
relative error
and the threshold  = 10‚àí6 is chosen. We run three
kM kF
different algorithms, nuclear used the nuclear optimization formulation (1),
k2-nuclear used the proposed iterative algorithm with initial solution obtained
from (1), and k2-zero used the same algorithm with initial solution X 0 = 0.

Fig. 1. Recovery probabilities and average computation times of three algorithms

Figure 1 shows recovery probabilities and average computation times (in seconds)
for different sizes of the linear map.
The results show that the proposed algorithm can recover exactly the matrix
M with 100% rate when s ‚â• 250 with both initial solutions while the nuclear norm approach cannot recover any matrix at all, i.e., 0% rate, if s ‚â§ 300.
k2-nuclear is slightly better than k2-zero in terms of recoverability when s is
small while their average computational times are almost the same in all cases.
The efficiency of the proposed algorithm when s is small comes with higher average computational times as compared to that of the nuclear norm approach.
For example, when s = 180, on average, one needs 80 iterations to reach the
solution when the proposed algorithm is used instead of 1 with the nuclear norm
optimization approach. Note that the average number of iterations is computed
for all cases including cases when the matix M cannot be recovered. For recov-

erable cases, the average number of iterations is much less. For example, when
s = 180, the average number of iterations for recoverable case is 40 instead of 80.
When the size of the linear map increases, the average number of iterations is
decreased significantly. We only need 2 extra iterations when s = 250 or 1 extra
iteration on average when s = 300 to obtain 100% recover rate when the nuclear
norm optimization approach still cannot recover any of the matrices (0% rate).
These results show that the proposed algorithm achieve significantly better recovery rate with a small number of extra iterations in many cases. We also test
the algorithms with higher ranks including r = 5 and r = 10. Figure 2 shows
the results when the size of linear map is s = d1.05dr e.

Fig. 2. Recovery probabilities and average computation times for different ranks

These results show that when the size of linear maps is small, the proposed
algorithms are significantly better than the nuclear norm optimization approach.
With s = d1.05dr e, the recovery probability increases when r increases and it is

10

X. V. Doan and S. Vavasis

close to 1 when r = 10. The computational time increases when r increases given
that the size of the sub-problems depends on the size of the linear map. With
respect to the number of iterations, it remains low. When r = 10, the average
numbers of iterations are 22 and 26 for k2-nuclear and k2-zero, respectively. It
shows that k2-nuclear is slightly better than k2-zero both in terms of recovery
probability and computational time.

Conclusion

We have proposed non-convex models based on the dual Ky Fan 2-k-norm for
low-rank matrix recovery and developed a general DCA framework to solve the
models. The computational results are promising. Numerical experiments with
larger instances will be conducted with first-order algorithm development for the
proposed modes as a future research direction.
