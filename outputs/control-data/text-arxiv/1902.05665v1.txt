The localized-to-itinerant transition of f electrons lies at the heart of heavy fermion physics, but has only
been directly observed in single-layer Ce-based materials. Here we report a comprehensive study on the electronic structure and nature of the Ce 4 f electrons in the heavy fermion superconductor Ce2 PdIn8 , a typical n=2
Cen Mm In3n+2m compound, using high-resolution and 4d-4 f resonant photoemission spectroscopies. The electronic structure of this material has been studied over a wide temperature range, and hybridization between f
and conduction electrons can be clearly observed to form Kondo resonance near the Fermi level at low temperature. The characteristic temperature of the localized-to-itinerant transition is around 120 K, which is much
higher than its coherence temperature T coh ∼ 30 K.

In heavy fermion materials, f electrons generally exhibit both itinerant and localized feature as the temperature
changes. According to the standard Kondo lattice model, f
electrons are localized at high temperatures, while conduction electrons would screen the local moments of f electrons
to form Kondo singlets upon cooling, eventually resulting
in an itinerant heavy Fermi-liquid ground state [1]. On the
other hand, the recent two-fluid theory suggests that part of
an atom’s f electrons give rise to the itinerant properties at
low temperatures, while others account for the localization behavior at higher temperatures [2–5]. Experimentally, detailed
evolution of the localized-to-itinerant transition has also been
hotly debated [6–10]. Recently, the hybridization between f
and conduction electrons were extensively studied, and direct
evidence for such localized-to-itinerant transition has been observed in the CeMIn5 family (M=Co, Rh, Ir) [10–14]. However, in other Ce-based heavy-fermion compounds, temperature evolution of the localized-to-itinerant transition of the f
electrons has never been reported to the best of our knowledge [15, 16].
The Cen MIn3n+2 (M=Co, Rh or Ir, with n=1, 2, ∞) heavyfermion compounds consist of n layers of CeIn3 , stacked
sequentially along the c axis with one intervening layer of
MIn2 [17]. The electronic structure of the n=∞ and 1 com-

pounds, CeIn3 and CeMIn5 , has been extensively studied
by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [10–
12, 18, 19], which has been proved to be a powerful tool
to directly observe the behavior of f electrons. For the n=2
compounds, Ce2 CoIn8 and Ce2 RhIn8 have been investigated
through off-resonant ARPES, and Ce 4 f electrons were found
to be predominantly localized in both compounds [15, 16].
However, to date there have been no reports on these n=2
compounds by means of on-resonance ARPES, in which the
use of the 4d-4 f resonance would largely enhance the f electron photoemission matrix element. Moreover, for another important n=2 member, Ce2 PdIn8 with the unique paramagnetic ground state, de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measurements [20] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [21]
both suggest delocalized character of the Ce 4 f states therein,
yet a direct observation of the f -electron behavior, and particularly the itinerant-to-localized transition, in this compound is
still lacking.
In this Rapid Communication, we present a systematic
ARPES study on Ce2 PdIn8 . Its electronic structure is comprehensively revealed and directly compared with first-principles
calculations. In particular, the character of the f electrons
is studied by resonant ARPES, and the localized-to-itinerant
transition is directly found to set in at a surprisingly high temperature.
High-quality single crystals of Ce2 PdIn8 were synthesized
by a self-flux method as described in Ref. [22]. ARPES measurements were conducted with photons from Beamline I05

of the Diamond light source, which is equipped with a Scienta R4000 electron analyzer. The overall energy resolution
is 15∼25 meV depending on the photon energy, and the angular resolution was set to 0.3 ◦ . Samples were cleaved at 10 K
and then measured between 10 and 190 K under a vacuum better than 5 ×10−11 Torr. Electronic band structure calculations
of Ce2 PdIn8 were performed with the all-electron general potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FL-APW) method
as implemented in the Wien2k code [23]. The exchange and
correlation effects were treated using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form proposed by Perdew, Wang
and Ernzerhof [24]. The Ce 2 f electrons were removed from
valence band as it was previously done in DFT calculations for
Ce2 RhIn8 [12, 16]. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) was included
as a second variational step with a basis of scalar-relativistic
eigenfunctions, after the initial calculation was converged to
self-consistency. The Monkhorst–Pack [25] special k-point
scheme with 23 × 23 × 9 mesh was used resulting in 390 k
points in the irreducible part of the Brillouin zone. The wave
functions in the interstitial region were expanded using plane
waves with a cutoff of (Rmt Kmax ) = 8, where Kmax is the plane
wave cut-off, and R MT is the smallest of all atomic sphere
radii. Experimental lattice parameters have been used with
atoms fixed in their bulk positions.
Fig. 1(a) illustrates the crystal structure of Ce2 PdIn8 and
the corresponding three-dimensional Brillouin zone (BZ).
This compound forms in the tetragonal Ho2 CoIn8 -type crystal
structure (P4/mmm) with lattice parameters a=b=4.69 Å and
c=12.185 Å, and consists of a sequence of two CeIn3 layers
alternating with a PdIn2 layer along the c axis [26]. To investigate its three-dimensional electronic structure, we have per-

formed detailed kz -dependent measurements by varying the
photon energy between 75 and 95 eV. As shown in Fig. 1(b),
there exists weak photon-energy dependence of peak positions
in the momentum distribution curves (MDCs) taken along
the high symmetry Γ-M direction, indicating the quasi-twodimensional character. An inner potential of 13 eV, comparable to that of CeIn3 [19], has been obtained through the best
fit to the periodic variation of the MDCs’ peak positions according to the free-electron final-state model [27], allowing us
to determine the photon energies corresponding to the highsymmetry planes.
Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) compare photoemission intensity maps
for the ΓXM and ZAR planes, and their detailed photoemission intensity plots along high-symmetry directions are illustrated in Figs. 1(e-j) using the same colors. The Fermi surfaces
in the ΓXM plane consist of a square Fermi pocket around Γ
and a racetrack pocket centered at X (both formed by the holelike band γ), and four pockets around M resulting from the
Fermi crossings of the electronlike bands α, nearly-degenerate
ε/δ, and β. In the ZAR plane, both the shape of most Fermi
pockets and the corresponding band dispersions exhibit only
minor variations, confirming the quasi-two-dimensional character of these bands. Still, differences can be resolved between
the Fermi surface topologies of these two kz planes. Changes
in both the shape and size of the γ pocket in the ZAR plane
imply a three-dimensional character of this band. The main
bands in the vicinity of the Fermi level (E F ) have similar orbital character to those in the n=1 compound CeCoIn5 , while
band splitting due to interlayer coupling makes the band structure of Ce2 PdIn8 more complex. Overall, our experimental
data show a qualitative agreement with first-principles calcu-

lations, as displayed in Figs. 1(k) and 1(l).
In order to highlight the f -electron behavior, we chose
121 eV photons (the energy of the Ce 4d-4 f transition) to
realize resonant enhancement of the Ce 4 f photoionization
cross section. Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) show the off-resonance
and on-resonance photoemission intensity plots along Γ-M,
taken with 114 eV and 121 eV photons, respectively, using spolarized light. The corresponding on-resonance photoemission intensity plot taken with p-polarized light is displayed in
Fig. 2(d). Here, p- and s-polarized light is defined to be from
electric fields in and out of the emission plane, which is determined by the analyzer slit and the sample surface normal, as
illustrated in Fig. 2(a).
As shown in Fig. 2(b), Pd 4d and Ce 5d states dominate
the off-resonance spectra, consistent with the data shown in
Fig. 1(e). The Ce 4 f character is strongly enhanced in the onresonance cases, as demonstrated by the flat bands in the photoemission intensity plots [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)] and the apparent peaks in the corresponding integrated spectra [Fig. 2(e)].
The three evident features located around E F , -0.25 eV and
-2.5 eV below E F can be well understood by the single impu1
rity Anderson model (SIAM) and were thus assigned as 4 f5/2
,
1
0
4 f7/2 and 4 f , respectively [10, 29]. Moreover, we note that
the 4 f state near E F shows a sharp peak under s-polarized
light but a broad hump in p-polarized light, and the overall
f electron intensity observed with p-polarized light is weaker
than with s-polarized light. Therefore, further investigations
of the Ce 4 f states in this compound were performed with
s-polarized light.

Next we performed temperature-dependent ARPES measurements on this compound to investigate the evolution of
the itinerant/localized nature of the f electrons with temperature. At 5 K, a flat f -electron feature near E F can be clearly
observed in the intensity plot, as demonstrated in Fig. 3(a). At
this temperature, large f spectral weight can be clearly observed near E F , suggesting a rather itinerant nature of the
f electrons. Upon increasing the temperature, the spectral
weight of the f states gradually diminishes while that of the β
band is still preserved even to rather high temperature (180 K).
This temperature dependence is also clearly visible when directly comparing the EDCs at Γ taken at different temperatures [Fig. 3(b)]. We observe a suppression of the f spectral
weight upon increasing temperature, and the sharp f -electron
quasi-particle peak near E F is no longer visible at 150 K.
Fig. 3(c) presents the temperature dependence of f -electron
spectral weight in the vicinity of Γ in Ce2 PdIn8 , which is obtained by integrating the EDCs over [E F - 100 meV, E F + 10
meV]. Here, the spectral weight has been normalized at 200K
and is found to keep arising with the decreasing temperature,
showing the same trend as Fig. 3(b).
For comparison, Fig. 3(d) and Fig. 3(e) show the normalized photoemission intensity maps taken at 5 K and 190 K,
respectively. In the 5 K Fermi surface map, the normalized intensity around the Brillouin zone center is strongly enhanced,
originating from the itinerant f states. In contrast, the f electron spectral weight around the same momentum is greatly
suppressed for the map contour taken at 190 K. Note that we
have presented both maps using the same color scale, so the
much higher spectral weight around the zone center at 5 K
should not be artificial. Moreover, as shown in the supplementary material[28], direct comparison of MDCs taken at
5 K and 190 K can further confirm the spreading out of the
f -band spectral weight from the zone center to somewhere
with the increasing temperature. All the above data explicitly show the characteristic localized-to-itinerant crossover of
f electrons, which has never been reported in the prototypical
Ce 218 heavy fermion systems before. Remarkably, the occurrence of hybridization starts from about 120 K in Ce2 PdIn8 ,
which is much higher than T coh ∼ 30 K [22, 30–32].
In Fig. 4 we present the zoomed-in photoemission intensity
plot near E F to concentrate on the f -electron character and
quasiparticle bands. Compared with spectra taken at high temperatures, when the β band shows linear dispersion, evident
bending of this band around E F can be observed at the low
temperature [Fig. 4(a)]. This is a direct evidence of the hybridization between the f and conduction electrons. According to the standard view on the heavy fermion ground state
based on periodic Anderson Model (PAM), the hybridization between the f and conduction electrons would create
two separate bands with band bending near E F . Meanwhile,
the f spectral weight should be redistributed, with significant
enhancement to the “inside” of the hole-like bands and the
“outside” of the electron-like bands. In Fig. 4(b), we indeed observe the enhancement of the f spectral weight “inside” of the hole-like β band, which is one more evidence for
the hybridization between the f and conduction electrons in
Ce2 PdIn8 . Such behavior is similar to that observed in the

heavy-fermion compound CeIrIn5 [14].
To further quantitatively investigate the hybridization of
conduction bands and f electrons, we zoom in the spectral
feature around Γ in the vicinity of E F and then performed
the PAM fitting, which has been proved an effective way to
study the f electron behaviors [10, 13]. Details of the band
dispersion extraction and the PAM fitting can be found in the
supplementary material [28]. Here, the resolution-convoluted
Fermi-Dirac distribution has been divided in order to probe
the band structure slightly above E F , as shown in Fig. 5(a).
Quantitatively, a fit to PAM picture gives a renormalized hybridization Vk =15±5 meV for both conduction bands,
which implies the substantial hybridization strength between
f electrons and conduction d bands. Moreover, as shown in
Fig. 5(b), a heavy quasiparticle band is induced with an energy dispersion of around 6 meV, which is larger than that in
CeIn3 [18, 33], indicating a stronger hybridization in CeIn3 .

To summarize, we have characterized the electronic structure and f electron behavior of Ce2 PdIn8 using highresolution resonant and non-resonant ARPES. Besides presenting the low-lying electronic structure of this material, we
have shown how localized f electrons in Ce2 PdIn8 become
partially itinerant and evolve into the heavy-fermion state
from a much higher temperature than the coherence temperature T coh . These findings provide a comprehensive experimental picture of the character of f electrons in Ce2 PdIn8 ,
complementing our understanding of f electrons’ itinerant-tolocalized evolution in the Cen Mm In3n+2m heavy fermion family.
