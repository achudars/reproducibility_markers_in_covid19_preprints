Topological quantum materials coupled with magnetism can provide a platform for
realizing rich exotic physical phenomena, including quantum anomalous Hall effect [1-4],
axion electrodynamics [5-7] and Majorana fermions [8]. However, these unusual effects
typically require extreme experimental conditions such as ultralow temperature [2, 4, 9]
or sophisticate material growth and fabrication [5, 7]. Recently, new intrinsic magnetic
topological insulators were proposed in MnBi2Te4-family compounds – on which rich
topological effects [10-12] could be realized under much relaxed experimental conditions
[13, 14]. However, despite the exciting progresses, the detailed electronic structures
observed in this family of compounds remain controversial [15-20] up to date. Here,
combining the use of synchrotron and laser light sources, we carried out comprehensive
and high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies on MnBi2Te4, and
clearly identified its topological electronic structures including the characteristic gapless
topological surface states. In addition, the temperature evolution of the energy bands
clearly reveals their interplay with the magnetic phase transition by showing interesting
differences for the bulk and surface states, respectively. The identification of the detailed
electronic structures of MnBi2Te4 will not only help understand its exotic properties, but
also pave the way for the design and realization of novel phenomena and applications.

Topological quantum materials (TQMs) represent special classes of materials whose
electronic structures can be characterized by topological invariants protected by certain
symmetries, and the breaking of these symmetries can lead to intriguing topological phase
transitions. Time reversal symmetry (TRS), for instance, is such an important symmetry in
TQMs. While the TRS can protect the unique helical gapless surface states in topological
insulators (TIs), it is broken in many exotic but interesting topological phases, such as quantum
anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators [1-4], topological axion insulators [5-7], magnetic Dirac and
Weyl semimetals [21-26] and compounds showing Majorana fermions [8]. However, despite
the many theoretical proposals [1, 21-27], finding real TQMs with spontaneous broken TRS is
challenging. For example, up to date, QAH effect could only be realized in TI (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3
thin films with fine-tuned magnetic doping (e.g. by V- or Cr-doping), under a temperature much
lower than their Currie temperature [2, 4]. Therefore, it is highly urged to search for
stoichiometric TQMs with intrinsic magnetic structures for the realization of high-temperature
QAH effect and other exotic topological properties.
Recently, it was realized that a layered compound, MnBi2Te4 could be a promising
magnetic TI with intrinsic A-type anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) order [10-12] that can serve as an
ideal platform for the realization of QAH effects and other interesting magnetic topological
phases including axion insulator and ideal Weyl semimetal phases [11]. Indeed, experimental
efforts soon followed and topological phenomena such as magnetic-field-induced QAH effect
[13] and quantum phase transition from axion insulator to Chern insulator [14] were recently
observed. In order to understand the rich properties and explore the full application potential of
MnBi2Te4, both the surface and bulk electronics structures need to be experimentally verified.
Unfortunately, although there have been several attempts to resolve the band structures of
this interesting compound, the results remain controversial and even conflicting [15-20]. First
of all, the identification of the topological surface states (TSSs) remains elusive, leading to
significant difference in identifying the band gap of the surface state (due to the formation of
magnetic order), ranging from 50 meV [15] to a couple of hundreds of meVs [16-19]. More

intriguingly, these assumed gaps of the topological surface state persist well above the Néel
temperature (TN) of MnBi2Te4 (25K, see ref [17]) and could even be observed at room
temperature [16, 18]. The order of magnitude’s difference between the room temperature (300K)
and the TN of MnBi2Te4 (25K) make it less convincing that the observed gap originates from
the magnetic order. Finally, the fact that the measured gap size varies with photon energy [1519], further alludes its bulk origin. These puzzles thus demand a systematic investigation on the
electronic structure of MnBi2Te4 that can clearly distinguish the surface and bulk states in order
to reveal their connection to the AFM transition – which can lay the foundation to the
understanding of the interplay between the electronic structure, magnetic ordering and the rich
topological phenomena of this material.
In this work, combining the use of synchrotron and laser light sources, we carried out
comprehensive and high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
studies on MnBi2Te4, and clearly identified its topological electronic structures including the
characteristic TSSs. The broad photon energy range provided by the synchrotron light source
allowed us to map out the subtle three-dimensional (3D) electronic structures; while the high
resolution laser light source made it possible to investigate the TSSs with great precision.
Furthermore, by carrying out temperature dependent measurements, we were able to observe
the temperature evolution from both the bulk and surface state bands, which shows interesting
difference between their interplay with the magnetic phase transition: while the bulk states
show clear splitting commencing at TN; the gap of TSSs is negligible within our energy
resolution [2 mV at temperature (7.5 K) well below TN], which could be due to the highly
delocalized nature of TSSs mediated by surface magnetic domains of different magnetization
orientations. The identification of the detailed electronic structures of MnBi2Te4 will not only
help understand its exotic properties, but also pave the way for the design and realization of
novel phenomena and applications.
MnBi2Te4 crystallizes into a rhombohedral lattice with space group of R3̅m [19, 28]. It
exhibits a layered structure by staking van der Waals septuple Te-Bi-Te-Mn-Te-Bi-Te layers,

which has an extra Mn-Te layer sandwiched at the middle of the well-known quintuple-layer
of Bi2Te3, as shown in Fig. 1a. The high quality of the single crystalline samples used in this
work is demonstrated by the single crystal X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 1b) and angle scan
(Fig 1c). The magnetic susceptibility and electric transport measurements (Fig. 1d) clearly show
the AFM phase transition at TN = 25 K. For the ARPES measurements, the sample was cleaved
in-situ with flat surfaces, showing clear layered structure (Fig. 1b). Scanning tunnelling
microscopy measurement reveals step height of about 1.37 nm on the sample surface, in good
consistence with the thickness of the septuple layer (1/3 c) in MnBi2Te4. The characteristic Mn,
Bi and Te core level peaks in X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurement further confirm
the sample phase (Fig. 1f). The broad band structure mapping at the surface Dirac point [~0.27
eV below the Fermi energy (EF), as we will discuss later] over multiple Brillouin zones (BZs)
shows clear point-like features with hexagonal symmetry (Fig. 1g), in consistence with the
crystal structures of MnBi2Te4.
The bulk band structure of MnBi2Te4 is illustrated in Fig. 2. The conduction and valance
bands form an inverted bulk gap [10, 11] whose magnitude varies with the photon energies
used for the ARPES measurements (Fig. 2a, b), indicting its bulk nature. Depending on the
methods used for gap extraction (see SI for details), the bulk gap size at different kz momentum
varies from 180~220meV [fitted peak-peak gap in energy distribution curves (EDCs)] or
80~160meV (EDC leading edge gap), as summarized in Fig. 2b(iii). Interestingly, besides the
bulk bands with very strong photoemission spectra intensity that agree well with the
calculations (Fig. 2c(i)), one can notice that there is also weak spectra intensity within the bulk
band gap (Fig. 2c(ii-iv)), showing an “X” shape dispersion centered at the  point, similar to
the dispersion of the TSSs of other 3D TIs [29, 30].
To further investigate the TSSs in the bulk band gap, we carried out laser based ARPES
measurements with superb energy and momentum resolution, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The
evolution of band structures with different binding energy (Fig. 3a, b) clearly shows the gapless
TSSs with conical shape dispersion across the Dirac point located at E ~ -0.27 eV within the

bulk band gap. The linear dispersion of these TSSs can be directly seen in Fig. 3c, with
vanishing energy gap less than the energy resolution of the experiments (E~2 meV), which
can be better seen in the zoom-in plot around the Dirac point (Fig. 3d).
Besides the TSSs, the high resolution in the measurement of laser based ARPES also allow
us to investigate the bulk states with great details. From the spectra intensity map (Fig.3c), the
2nd derivative plot (Fig. 3e) or the stacking momentum distribution curves (MDC) plot (Fig. 3f),
one can clearly see three conduction bands. Interestingly, by comparing with theoretical
calculation of bulk bands in Fig. 2c(i), we notice that an extra bulk band is observed, whose
origin will be discussed later. We mark the observed conduction bands as CB2, CB1a, and CB1b
respectively as shown in Fig. 3e, f (the reason of the naming will be discussed below).
To understand the interplay between the band structure and the magnetic properties of
MnBi2Te4, we carried out a series of temperature dependent ARPES measurements across TN,
which are summarized in Fig. 4. For the bulk conduction bands, upon the increase of
temperature, the CB1a and CB1b bands move towards each other and eventually merge into one
single band (CB1) above TN, as illustrated in Fig. 4a, b. When the temperature is sequentially
cooled down to below TN, CB1 splits into CB1a and CB1b again, as can be clearly seen in Fig.
4a(vi) and Fig.4b(vi), the same behavior has been observed in the measurements on multiple
samples (see SI for more details). The side-by-side comparison between the band structure
above and below TN can be seen in Fig. 4c for clarity and the temperature evolution of the EDCs
at the  point is summarized in Fig. 4d, with the fitted peak-to-peak splitting of the CB1a and
CB1b on multiple temperatures plotted in Fig. 4e. The coincidence of the splitting temperature
and the TN near 25 K indicates a correlation between the band splitting and the formation of the
magnetic order. Although the observed bulk band splitting is beyond expectation of an AFM
system, it is accessible considering the surface ferromagnetic ordering, which has been shown
to induce considerable exchange splitting in AFM EuRh2Si2 [31]. On the other hand, according
to first-principles calculations, CB1a and CB1b are mainly contributed by Te pz orbital. When

the temperature increases above TN, the exchange induced splitting vanishes, which has
complicated influence on interlayer coupling and band dispersion, leading to the merge of the
CB1a and CB1b bands.
Interestingly, in contrast to the bulk bands, the TSSs show no observable temperature
dependence (Fig. 4a, b), with diminishing gap in a large temperature range. In the AFM
MnBi2Te4, the TSSs can be described by an effective Hamiltonian 𝐻(𝒌) = 𝜎𝑥 𝑘𝑦 − 𝜎𝑦 𝑘𝑥 +
𝑚
̃ 𝑧 𝜎𝑧 , where 𝜎𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 are the Pauli matrices for spins, and 𝑚
̃ 𝑧 is the effective mass induced by
exchange interactions on the surface, which could open a surface gap of 2|𝑚
̃ 𝑧 |. For T > TN, the
system becomes paramagnetic, TRS gets preserved, and thus MnBi2Te4 transits into the timereversal invariant TI phase, implying a vanishing surface gap. When the temperature is lowered
below TN, the material will transit into A-type AFM state, as revealed by previous studies [10,
11]. Therefore, if the surface magnetism is ideally ordered along the out-of-plane z direction, a
surface gap of ~40 meV would develop, as indicated by theoretical calculations [10]. The
observed surface gap, however, is vanishingly small, suggesting that the surface magnetism
may not be well ordered. The result could presumably be explained by following mechanisms.
Firstly, the interlayer antiferromagnetic interactions are weaker on the surface than in the bulk,
and the magnetic dipole-dipole interactions of ferromagnetic monolayer typically prefers an inplane easy axis, which makes the orientation of surface magnetism easily fluctuated. The
surface magnetism, once oriented along the in-plane x direction, would contribute an interaction
term of 𝑚
̃ 𝑥 𝜎𝑥 into the effective Hamiltonian, which cannot open the surface gap as confirmed
by recent calculations [32]. This would shift the Dirac point of TSSs slightly away from the Γ
point. However, the averaged shift over different in-plane orientations would vanish due to the
high symmetry of the in-plane structure. Secondly, magnetic domains ubiquitously exist in
AFM materials and cannot be easily eliminated even by field cooling. Since the sign of
exchange-induced mass depends on the orientation of surface magnetism, opposing magnetic
domains would lead to opposite exchange effects. It is well known that Dirac-like surface states
can have unusually large localization length 𝜆𝐷 (T) caused by the Berry phase of 𝜋 [33] and

𝜆𝐷 (T) greatly enhances with decreasing temperature. At low temperatures 𝜆𝐷 is expected to
significantly exceed the size of magnetic domains (typically on the order of 10 nm) [34]. Thus,
the effective exchange effects experienced by TSSs are contributed by a few magnetic domains,
whose averaged effects are weakened by magnetic compensation. From another point of view,
gapless chiral boundary modes are topologically protected to exist in the presence of opposing
magnetic domains [35]. The gapless modes would play an important role in determining
macroscopic properties of TSSs if the domain size is small enough (e.g., compared to 𝜆𝐷 (T)).
This could also help explain why no magnetization-induced surface gap observed in MnBi2Te4.
In conclusion, we have presented a systematic investigation of the electronic structure of
AFM-TI candidate MBT. We observed gapped bulk electronic bands with clear kz dispersion
and a gapless TSS as the characteristic topological electronic structure which is attributed to
the neutralized net magnetic moment of domains with different magnetization directions. We
further observed bulk band splitting possibly related to the surface ferromagnetism caused by
the Mn atoms buried in the surface layer. Our results not only reconcile the contradicting results
on the origin and magnitude of previously observed gap in MBT, but also provide important
insights into the electronic structure and magnetism of MBT, which is crucial for the
understanding of the interplay between magnetism and topology in AFM TIs.
Note Added: During preparing this manuscript, another work reported gapless surface
electronic states on MnBi2Te4 single crystals, which is in good agreement with our observations
[36].

Methods:
Crystal growth:
The single crystal of MnBi2Te4 was grown by a direct reaction of a stoichiometric mixture of
Bi2Te3 and MnTe, which were synthesized by reacting high-purity Bi (99.99%, Adamas) and
Te (99.999%, Aladdin), and Mn (99.95%, Alfa Aesar) and Te (99.999%, Aladdin), respectively.
The growth of high-quality MnBi2Te4 single crystals was carried out in a sealed silica ampoule
under a dynamic vacuum. The ampoule was firstly heated to 973 K. After being slowly cooled
down to 864 K, the crystal growth occurred during the long-term annealing at the same
temperature and afforded mm-sized shiny single crystals of MnBi2Te4. The crystals were
examined on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation to establish the
correct phase and high-quality of single crystal samples for the experiment.

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy:
ARPES measurements were performed at beamline I05 of the Diamond Light Source
(DLS), UK, beamline 13U of National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in Hefei,
China, and beamline 10.0.1 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS), USA. The samples were
cleaved in-situ and measured under ultra-high vacuum below 1×10-10 Torr at DLS, 6×10-11 Torr
at NSRL and 3×10-11 Torr at ALS. Data were collected by Scienta R4000, DA30 L and R4000
analysers at DLS, NSRL and ALS respectively. The total convolved energy and angle
resolutions were 15 meV and 0.2°, respectively.
High-resolution laser-based ARPES measurement were performed at home-built setups
(hv=6.994eV) in Tsinghua University and ShanghaiTech University. The samples were cleaved
in-situ and measured under ultra-high vacuum below 6×10-11 Torr. Data were collected by a
DA30 L analyser. The total convolved energy and angle resolutions were 2 meV and 0.1°,
respectively.

First-principles calculations:

First-principles calculations were performed by density functional theory (DFT) using the
Vienna ab initio Simulation Package . The plane-wave basis with an energy cutoff of 350 eV
was adopted. The electron-ion interactions were modeled by the projector augmented wave
potential and the exchange-correlation functional was approximated by the Perdew-BurkeErnzerhof type generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [37]. The GGA+U method was
applied to describe the localized 3d-orbitals of Mn atoms, for which U = 4.0 eV was selected
according to our previous tests [10]. The structural relaxation for optimized lattice constants
and atomic positions was performed with a force criterion of 0.01 eV/ Å and by using the DFTD3 method to include van der Waals corrections. Spin-orbit coupling was included in selfconsistent calculations and the Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of 9×9×3 was adopted. Surface
state calculations were performed with WannierTools package [38], based on the tight-binding
Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF) [39] .
