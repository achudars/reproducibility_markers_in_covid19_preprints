Abstract
Charged multiplicity distribution in a pseudo-rapidity window is formulated under
the assumption that the charge conservation is satisfied in the full phase space. At
first, we analyze measured charged particle multiplicity distributions in pseudo-rapidity
windows in LHC by the CMS and ALICE collaborations with the two probability
distributions. One is the convolution of negative binomial and Poisson distributions,
and the other is the Glauber-Lachs formula. Each distribution is considered as an
analogy of the quantum optics. Next, we analyze the data with the double GL formulae
for |η| < 2.4 at 7 TeV by the CMS collaboration and for |η| < 1.5 at 8 TeV by the
ALICE collaboration to describe the global structure of measured distributions.

Introduction

In the middle of 1980’s, multiplicity distributions of charged particles in pseudo-rapidity
windows were reported in the CERN pp̄ collider experiments [1]. To analyze the data, a
multiplicity distribution which is a convolution of a negative binomial distribution (NBD)
and a Poisson distribution (PSND) was proposed [2]:

P (n, hni) =
P (n1 , hn1 i)P2 (n2 , hn2 i),

In the above equations, hni, hn1 i, and hn2 i denote the average multiplicities in each distribution, where a relation, hni = hn1 i + hn2 i, holds. Three parameters, k, hni and p̃ = hn1 i/hni
are contained in Eq.(1). The NBD corresponds to the distribution of particles emitted from
the chaotic sources in the thermal equilibrium, and the PSND to that of particles emitted
from the coherent source. After the analysis of measured negative charged multiplicity
√
distributions in the full phase space at s = 540 GeV by the use of Eq.(1) with k = 1 and
k = 2, measured charged multiplicity distributions in the pseudo-rapidity windows were
analyzed to estimate the value of p̃. A stochastic background of Eq.(1) was investigated in
[3].

In a model of identical particle correlations based on the quantum optical approach [4, 5],
particles emitted from chaotic sources and those from coherent source are correlated [6, 7, 8].
Therefore, the multiplicity distribution composed of chaotic and coherent components is not
necessarily written by two independent distributions such as Eq. (1).
In [9], a multiplicity distribution obtained from semi-inclusive momentum distributions
in the quantum optical approach have been presented:

1 + pin hni
where, pin denotes the ratio of the average multiplicity of negative charged particles emitted
from the chaotic source to hni. Equation (4) is called Glauber-Lachs (GL) formula [4, 5, 10]
In the LHC experiments, charged particle multiplicity distributions are measured in
restricted pseudo-rapidity windows. In the full phase space, charge conservation should be
satisfied. Therefore, we would like to consider a relation between the charged multiplicity
distribution in a pseudo-rapidity window and that in the full phase space. In addition, we
would like to investigate some characteristics in p̃ and pin analyzing the measured multiplicity distributions in the recent LHC experiments by Eq.(1) with k = 1, or 2, and Eq.(4).
√
In [11], measured charged multiplicity distributions at s = 1800 GeV were analysed by
the use of the QCD Monte Carlo program HERWIG (versin 5.7). Due to the contribution
of two jets events with large pseudorapidity gap, a relation on the mupliplicity distribution, P (0) ' 2P (1), was obtained. The result is similar to measured charged multiplicity
distributions in the LHC experiments.
√
In the invariant energy s above several hundred GeV, it is considered that it would
be very hard to describe measured multiplicity distributions with a single probability distribution [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. We also try to fit the data with double GL formulae.
The present paper is organized as follows. In section 2, charged multiplicity distribution
in a pseudo-rapidity window is formulated under the assumption that the charge conservation is satisfied in the full phase space. In section 3, charged multiplicity distributions
in pseudo-rapidity windows measured in the LHC experiments are analyzed by the use of
Eq.(1) and Eq.(4). Moreover, double GL formulae are used in the analysis. Section 4 is
devoted to concluding remarks. Detail calculations for some equations in section 2, and
explicit expressions of charged multiplicity distributions for PSND, NBD and generalized
Glauber-Lachs (GGL) formula in the pseudo-rapidity window are shown in appendix A.
For comparison, we also analyze the data, directly using Eq.(1) with two parameters p̃
and hni. The results are shown in appendix B. In appendix C, Data are also analyzed by
Eq.(4) with two parameters, pin and hnch i in place of hni.

Charged multiplicity distribution in a pseudo-rapidity window with charge conservation in the full phase space

In the full phase space, the measured multiplicity distribution satisfies the charge conservation. For simplicity, we assume that the charged particles are produced in pairs of a positive
charged particle and a negative charged particle. Let P (n), n = 0, 1, . . . be a multiplicity
distribution of negative charged particles, and Pch (2n) be that of charged particles in the
full phase space. We assume that a relation,
P (n) = Pch (2n),
holds.

(5)

Furthermore, we would like to adopt the following assumption: A probability that each
particle produced in the full phase space enters into a limited window (and is detected) is
ζ ( 0 ≤ ζ ≤ 1 ), and that each particle does not enter into the window is 1 − ζ. When more
than n pairs of charged particles are produced in the full phase space, and m (2n ≤ m ≤ 0)
charged particles enter into the pseudo-rapidity window, the probability distribution Pob (m)
that m charged particles enter into the window is written as,
Pob (m) =

∞
X

2n Cm ζ

m

(1 − ζ)2n−m Pch (2n).

(6)

2n≥m

In the following, P (n) is written as P (n, hni) with the average multiplicity hni of negative charged particles in the full phase space. A multiplicity distribution Pζ (j) is defined
as
Pζ (j) ≡

∞
X

n Cj


j 
n−j
ζ(2 − ζ) (1 − ζ)2
P (n, hni),

j = 0, 1, 2, · · · ,

(7)

n=j

which denotes the multiplicity distribution that when n pairs (n ≥ j) of charged particles
are produced, (n−j) pairs are outside the pseudo-rapidity window, and at least one particle
enters into the window from any j pairs of negative and positive charged particles.
Relations among Pob (n), Pζ (j) and P (n, hni) are shown in Appendix A. We obtain from
Eq.(35):
[n/2]

Pob (n) =

X

n−j Cj

j=0

(ζ 2 )j [2ζ(1 − ζ)]n−2j
Pζ (n − j).
[ζ(2 − ζ)]n−j

(8)

In the present paper, we use three distribution functions, PSND, NBD and GL formula
for P (n, hni). In any of the three distribution functions, the following relation holds:
Pζ (n) = P (n, hnζ i),

hnζ i = ζ(2 − ζ)hni.

(9)

From Eqs.(8) and (9), the multiplicity distribution Pob (n) of charged particles in the pseudorapidity window is expressed with that P (n, hni) of negative charged particles in the full
phase space as,
[n/2]

Pob (n) =

X
j=0

n−j Cj

(ζ 2 )j [2ζ(1 − ζ)]n−2j
P (n − j, hnζ i).
[ζ(2 − ζ)]n−j

(10)

If we can omit ζ 2 which is regarded as much smaller than ζ in Eq.(10), we obtain a
relation,
Pob (n) ' P (n, 2ζhni).

Analysis of charged multiplicity distributions in pseudorapidity windows

√
At first, the invariant energy s dependence of average charged multiplicity, hnch i, in the
full phase space in non-single diffractive (NSD) events is parametrized as,
hnch i = 0.986s1/4 + 6.309,

(12)

√
√
by the least mean square method with the data from s = 30.4 GeV to s = 1800
GeV [19, 20, 21]. The average multiplicity of negative charged particles in the full phase
space, hni, is estimated from Eq.(12) with the relation hni = hnch i/2. Those used in the
present analysis [16, 22] are listed in Table 1.

In the experiments of Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC), the number of identical boson
pairs, say π − pairs N (2−) relative to the number
of uncorrelated pion pairs N BG as a
p
function of relative momentum squared, Q = −(p1 − p2 )2 , is measured, and for example,
it is fitted by
N (2−) /N BG = C[1 + λ Ω(Qr)](1 + δ Q).
Function Ω(Qr) is often parametrized as Ω(Qr) = e−Qr . Normalization factor C is determined so as to N (2−) /N BG ' 1 for Q >> 1.
In the quantum optical approach to the BEC [23], the second order BEC function is
given by
N (2−) /N BG = 1 + 2pin (1 − pin )e−Qr + pin 2 e−2Qr .
Therefore, the following relation is satisfied:
λ = pin (2 − pin ).

(13)

In the present analysis, we estimate the value of pin from the measured charged multiplicity distribution. Data samples used in the BEC experiments are different from those
used in the charged multiplicity measurements [24, 25]. For example, in the CMS collaboration, BEC data are taken for pT > 200 MeV and |η| < 2.4 [24]. On the other hand, measured
charged multiplicity distributions in pseudo-rapidity windows are taken for pT > 0 MeV.
Therefore, it is not clear whether Eq.(13) is satisfied or not. We would like to compare the
estimated value of pin (2 − pin ) with parameter λ estimated from the BEC experiments.

Analysis with Eq.(10) and the convolution of NBD and PSND

We analyze the charged multiplicity distributions of non-single diffractive (NSD) events in
the pseudo-rapidity window, |η| < ∆η [22, 16].
At first, we analyze measured charged multiplicity distributions by the CMS Collaboration in pseudo-rapidity windows, |η| < ∆η, at ∆η = 0.5, 1, 0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.4 with Eq.(10)
and the convolution of NBD and PSND given by the following equation with k = 1 or 2,

Analysis of charged multiplicity distributions with double GL formulae

√
In the invariant energy s region above several hundred GeV, it is assumed that mainly
two production processes occur exclusively each other. Process 1 (soft process) occurs with
a probability α and the multiplicity distribution of negative particles is given P1 (n, hn1 i),
process 2 (semi-hard process) occurs with a probability (1−α) and the multiplicity distribution of negative particles is given P2 (n, hn2 i) In the full phase space, combined multiplicity
distribution P (n, hni) can be given by the following equation,
P (n, hni) = αP1 (n, hn1 i) + (1 − α)P2 (n, hn2 i).

(16)

From Eq.(16), we obtain
hni = αhn1 i + (1 − α)hn2 i.

(17)

In our approach, the observed multiplicity distribution Pob (n) in a pseudo-rapidity
window is given by

In our parametrization, hni is given from Eq.(12) or Table 1, and r2 is determined from
Eq.(20). Therefore, 6 parameters α, r1 , p1 , ζ1 p2 and ζ2 , are contained in Eq.(18).

Concluding remarks

Multiplicity distribution in the pseudo-rapidity window, which satisfies the charge conservation in the full phase space, is formulated. By the use of the GL formula for the multiplicity
distribution of negative charged particles in the full phase space, we analyze the charged

11

multiplicity distributions in pseudo-rapidity windows in non-single diffractive (NSD) events
reported by CMS and ALICE Collaborations.
R1) The probability ζ that each particle enter into the given pseudo-rapidity window
|η| < ∆η is approximately expressed by ζ = a∆η with parameter a, which depends on the
√
invariant energy s.
R2) In our analysis, relation, Pob (0) > Pob (1), holds, which is similar to the experimental
data. In [17], relation Pob (0) > Pob (1) and peak around 4 < n < 8 are well reproduced by
the use of a compound distribution. For the relation Pob (0) > Pob (1), see also [11].
R3) In the measured charged multiplicity distributions for ∆η > 1.5, a peak appears
around 4 < n < 8 in each distribution. We cannot reproduce the peak from our calculation
with the single GL formula.
R4) We can reproduce global behavior of measured multiplicity distributions for ∆η =
√
√
2.4 at s = 7 TeV by the CMS Collaboration, and for ∆η = 1.5 at s = 8 TeV by the
ALICE Collaboration with the double GL formulae.
R5) For example, if two jet-like structure appears and charge conservation is satisfied
in each jet-like structure in the soft or semi-hard process [26], it would be appropriate to
use the GGL formula with k=2.
R6) We obtain the relation, Pob (n) ' P (n, 2ζhni), from Eqs.(9) and (10), if ζ 2 is much
smaller than ζ.

A

Multiplicity distribution in a pseudo-rapidity window

In the full phase space, the measured multiplicity distribution should satisfy the charge
conservation. For simplicity, we assume that the charged particles are produced in pairs
of a positive charged particle and a negative charged particle. Let P (n), n = 0, 1, . . . be
a multiplicity distribution of negative charged particles, and Pch (2n) be that of charged
particles in the full phase space. We assume that a relation,
P (n) = Pch (2n)

(21)

holds. The probability generating function (GF) Π(z) for P (n), and that Πch (z) for Pch (2n)
are respectively written as,
Π(z) =

∞
X

P (n)z n ,

Πch (z) =

n=0

∞
X

Pch (2n)z 2n .

(22)

n=0

From Eq.(22), we have following relations,
1 (n)
Π (z)|z=0 ,

(2n−1)
Pch (2n − 1) =
Πch
(z)|z=0 = 0,
(2n − 1)!
P (n) =

Pch (2n) =

(2n)
Πch (z)|z=0 .
(2n)!

From Eqs.(21) and (22, the following relation is satisfied:
Πch (z) = Π(z 2 ).

(23)

It is assumed that a probability that each particle produced in the full phase space
enters into a pseudo-rapidity window is ζ ( 0 ≤ ζ ≤ 1), and that each particle does not
enter into the window is 1 − ζ. When more than n pairs of positive and negative charged

12

particles are produced in the full phase space, and m (2n ≥ m ≥ 0) charged particles enter
into the pseudo-rapidity window, the probability distribution that m charged particles are
detected, Pob (m), is written as
Pob (m) =

X

2n Cm ζ

The GF for Pob (m) is defined by

Substituting Eq.(24) into Eq.(25), and using the definition of Πch (z), Eq.(22), we obtain

Πob (z) = Π (ζz + 1 − ζ)2 .
(26)
Putting
y=

(27)

and using the relation, (ζz + 1 − ζ)2 = ζ(2 − ζ)y + (1 − ζ)2 , we can rewrite Eq.(26) as

Equation (28) denotes the probability that when n pairs (n ≥ j) of charged particles are
produced, (n − j) pairs are outside the pseudo-rapidity window, and at least one particle
enters into the window from any j pairs of negative and positive charged particles. The GF
Πζ (y) is defined as
Πζ (y) =

(29)

In the following, the multiplicity distribution P (n) is written as P (n, hni), where hni is
the average multiplicity of negative charged particles in the full phase space. It’s GF Π(x)
is also written as Π(x, hni):
Π(x, hni) =

∞
X

P (j, hni)xj .

j=0

Then, we obtain two relations among three GF’s:
Πob (z) = Πζ (y),
Πζ (y) = Π(x, hni),

,
ζ(2 − ζ)
x = ζ(2 − ζ)(y − 1) + 1.

It should be noted that Πob (z) is the GF for Pob (n), Πζ (y) is that for Pζ (n), and
Π(x, hni) is for P (n, hni).

Relation between Pζ (n) and P (n, hni), or Πζ (y) and Π(x, hni)

If variable x is contained in the form of hni(x − 1) in Π(x, hni), Πζ (y) in Eq.(31) is written
as
Πζ (y) = Π(y, hnζ i),

hnζ i = ζ(2 − ζ)hni.

(36)

For example, let the multiplicity distribution of negative charged particles be given by
the Generalized Glauber-Lachs (GGL) formula with 0 < p < 1,
P (n, hni) =

When k = 1 with p = pin , the GGL formula, Eq.(37), reduces to the GL formula, Eq.(4).
Then, the generating function Πζ (y) for Pζ (n) is given from Eq.(36) as

The multiplicity distribution Pζ (n) is given from Π(y, hnζ i), and is equal to P (y, hnζ i):
Pζ (n) =

1 ∂ n Π(y, hnζ i)

y=0

= P (n, hnζ i).

Therefore, Pζ (n) is given from Eq.(37), if hni is replaced by hnζ i.

In the limit of p = 0, the generating function Π(x, hni) in Eq.(38) reduces to that of the
PSND,
Π(x, hni) = ehni(x−1) .
In the limit of p = 1, it reduces to the generating function of NBD,

Π(x, hni) = 1 − hni(x − 1)/k

The relation among P (n, hni), Π(x, hni) and Πζ (y) for the GGL formula is listed in
Table 8 with other two examples.

Difference between Pob (n) and P (n) in the second order factorial
moment

The mth order factorial moments for Pob (n) and Pζ (n) are respectively given by
∂ m Πob (z)
,
∂z m
z=1
∂ m Πζ (y)
.
≡ hn(n − 1) · · · (n − m + 1)iζ =
∂y m y=1

Fm,ob ≡ hn(n − 1) · · · (n − m + 1)iob =
Fm,ζ

If z = 1, then y = 1 from Eq.(33). Then we obtain from Eq.(34):
[m/2]

Fm,ob =

(ζ 2 )j [2ζ(1 − ζ)]m−2j

Fm−j,ζ .
j!(m − 2j)!
[ζ(2 − ζ)]m−j

(40)

From Eq.(40), we obtain,
hniob = 2ζhni,

(41)
2

hn(n − 1)iob = [2/(2 − ζ)] hn(n − 1)iζ + 2ζhni.

(42)

In the case of GGL formula, the second order factorial moment for Pob (n) is given by
hn(n − 1)iob = [1 + p(2 − p)/k][2ζhni]2 + ζ[2ζhni].

(43)

On the other hand, that for P (n) is given by
hn(n − 1)i = [1 + p(2 − p)/k]hni2 .

(44)

As can be seen from Eqs.(43) and (44), an additional term, ζ[2ζhni], appears on the right
hand side of Eq.(43), which is caused by the charge conservation in the full phase space.

Analysis by the convolution of NBD and PSND

In order to compare the results by Eqs.(10) and (14), where charge conservation in the full
phase space is taken into account, we also analyze the data by the convolution of NSD and
√
PSND, Eq.(1). Results at s = 0.9 and 2.36 TeV in the CMS Collaboration are shown
respectively in Tables 9 and 10.

Comparing each value of χ2min /n.d.f in Table 2 and that in Table 9, the ratio of the
former to the latter is from 0.79 to 0.91 at k = 1, and from 0.74 to 0.87 at k = 2.
In the comparison of each value of χ2min /n.d.f in Table 3 and that in Table 10, the ratio
is from 0.79 to 0.92 at k = 1, and from 0.86 to 0.92 at k = 2.
Therefore, fitting with Eqs.(10) and (14) becomes better than that with Eq.(1).
Similar calculations with k = 1 in Tables 9 and 10 were reported in [27].

Analysis by GL formula

In order to compare the results by Eqs.(10) and (14), where charge conservation in the full
phase space is taken into account, we also analyze the data by the GL formula, Eq.(4) with
√
two parameters, pin and hnch i, which is used in place of hni. Results at s = 0.9, 2.36 and
7 TeV in the CMS Collaboration are shown in Table 11.
In the comparison of each value of χ2min /n.d.f in Table 11 and that in Table 4, the former
is smaller than the latter. Therefore, fitting with Eqs.(10) and (14) becomes better than
that with Eq.(4).
As can be seen from Tables 4 and 11, hnob i = 2ζhni is almost the same with hnch i in
each analysis of tha data.
