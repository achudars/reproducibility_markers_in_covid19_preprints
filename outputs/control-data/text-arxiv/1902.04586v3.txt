ABSTRACT

Many stars form in regions of enhanced stellar density, where stellar neighbours can
have a strong influence on a protoplanetary disc (PPD) population. In particular,
far ultraviolet (FUV) flux from massive stars drives thermal winds from the outer
edge of PPDs, accelerating disc destruction. Here, we present a novel technique for
constraining the dynamical history of a star forming environment using PPD properties
in a strongly FUV irradiated environment. Applying recent models for FUV induced
mass loss rates to the PPD population of Cygnus OB2, we constrain the time since
primordial gas expulsion. This is 0.5 Myr ago if the Shakura & Sunyaev α-viscosity
parameter is α = 10−2 (corresponding to a viscous timescale of τvisc ≈ 0.5 Myr for a
disc of scale radius 40 au around a 1 M star). This value of α is effectively an upper
limit, since it assumes efficient extinction of FUV photons throughout the embedded
phase. This gas expulsion timescale is consistent with a full dynamical model that fits
kinematic and morphological data as well as disc fractions. We suggest Cygnus OB2
was originally composed of distinct massive clumps or filaments, each with a stellar
mass ∼ 104 M . Finally we predict that in regions of efficient FUV induced mass
loss, disc mass Mdisc as a function of stellar host mass mstar follows a power law with
Mdisc ∝ mβstar , where β exceeds ∼ 2.7 – steeper than correlations observed in regions
of moderate FUV flux (1 < β < 1.9). This difference offers a promising diagnostic of
the influence of external photoevaporation in a given region.

INTRODUCTION

The majority of stars form and spend their early stages of
evolution in regions of enhanced stellar density (Lada &
Lada 2003). This might be as part of a gravitationally bound
cluster, or if star formation efficiency is sufficiently low this
environment can become a short-lived association (Lada &
Lada 2003; Murray 2011; Pfalzner & Kaczmarek 2013). This
latter case is expected to be common (although see Kruijssen
2012), therefore understanding the effect of clustered environments on the early stages of stellar evolution is important
even for apparently isolated stars.
In particular, feedback from the stellar environment has
been shown to have a significant impact on planet formation in young clusters and associations. Protoplanetary disc
(PPD) lifetimes are thought to be ∼ 3 − 10 Myr (e.g Haisch

et al. 2001; Williams & Cieza 2011; Ribas et al. 2015), during which period a star typically remains in its formation
environment. In this case, PPD destruction can be induced
due to close star-disc encounters (Clarke & Pringle 1993;
Ostriker 1994; Pfalzner et al. 2005; Breslau et al. 2014; Winter et al. 2018a; Vincke & Pfalzner 2018; Cuello et al. 2018;
Concha-Ramı́rez et al. 2019) or far-ultraviolet (FUV) driven
external photoevaporation (and, to a lesser extent, extreme
ultraviolet - EUV, Johnstone et al. 1998; Störzer & Hollenbach 1999; Armitage 2000; Adams 2010; Facchini et al. 2016;
Haworth et al. 2018a; Winter et al. 2018b). Recent studies
suggest that, statistically speaking, the dominant disc dispersal mechanism is external photoevaporation (Scally &
Clarke 2001; Winter et al. 2018b), while encounters can set
PPD initial conditions during the evolution of stellar multiple systems (Winter et al. 2018c; Bate 2018).
FUV radiation has a significant influence on disc evolution in a wide range of environments. Mass loss from the

2

outer edge is driven when the thermal energy exceeds the
gravitational potential (e.g. Johnstone et al. 1998). The most
obvious examples of such a process are proplyds, visible for
example in the Orion Nebula Cluster (O’Dell & Wen 1994),
where the finite penetration of ionising radiation into a disc’s
neutral wind creates an offset (cometary) ionisation front.
The strong neutral winds in the Orion Nebula Cluster are
driven by FUV flux of FFUV ∼ 3 × 104 G0 1 . Since then proplyds have been found for discs which experience a factor
& 10 lower flux (Kim et al. 2016). Even when a proplyd is
not visible, a disc can exhibit significant FUV induced mass
loss. Haworth et al. (2017) find that in the very extended
disc around IM Lup, with FFUV ∼ 4 G0 , photoevaporation
drives substantial mass loss. A large fraction of stars form
in regions where FUV flux is considerably greater than this
(Fatuzzo & Adams 2008; Winter et al. 2018b).
The properties of young massive stellar clusters/associations and the giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
from which they form are diverse, and the link between
them is not well characterised (see Longmore et al. 2014, for
a review). During formation the early cluster may undergo
cold collapse (Tobin et al. 2009; Kuznetsova et al. 2018),
or after the expulsion of gas the stellar population may
become supervirial (Goodwin 2009; Pfalzner & Kaczmarek
2013), dependent on the density and velocity dispersion of
the primordial GMC. This in turn influences the evolution
of mass segregation (e.g. Bonnell & Davies 1998) and
substructure (e.g Goodwin & Whitworth 2004) within the
cluster. Because the environment of a star has an influence
on the associated PPD, the dynamical history of a cluster
is closely linked with the properties of a disc population.
While many authors have attempted to account for the
local environment in considering PPD evolution (e.g. Scally
& Clarke 2001; Cleeves et al. 2016; Guarcello et al. 2016),
none have inverted this method and used observed disc populations to put constraints on the dynamical history of a
star forming environment. This work is partly motivated by
this goal.
Cygnus OB2 (Cyg OB2) is a young massive OB association in the Cygnus X region, and has been used as an
empirical test of feedback mechanisms on PPD evolution. It
contains many massive stars up to ∼ 100 M (e.g. Massey
& Thompson 1991; Wright et al. 2015) which contribute to
strong FUV radiation fields. Guarcello et al. (2016) analysed
the disc fraction within Cygnus OB2 as a function of FUV
flux, and found that surviving discs were less common at
small projected separations from massive stars. Other authors, such as Wright et al. (2016), have made observations
which indicate a complex dynamical substructure within the
association. Collating this evidence, we here aim to apply N body simulations and those combining viscous disc evolution
and photoevaporation to replicate observations of Cyg OB2.
We will reproduce the present day stellar kinematics and a
dynamical history consistent with the observed disc fraction
distribution. In this way we can shed light on both the history and the likely future of the PPD population and the
stellar components.

In the remainder of this work we first review the observational constraints on the properties of Cyg OB2 in Section
2. We describe our numerical method and models in Section

2.1

PROPERTIES OF CYGNUS OB2
Stellar population

Cyg OB2 is a young association at a distance ∼ 1.33 kpc
from the Sun (Kiminki et al. 2015). The majority of members formed 3 − 5 Myr ago (Wright et al. 2010), although
some stars have ages as young as ∼ 2 Myr (Hanson 2003) and
as old as ∼ 7 Myr (Drew et al. 2008). Estimates of the total
stellar mass of Cyg OB2 have varied between 2–10 × 104 M
(Knödlseder 2000; Hanson 2003; Drew et al. 2008; Wright
et al. 2010), although Wright et al. (2015) find a slightly
lower mass of ∼ 1.6 × 104 M within a radius of 13 pc of the
apparent centre. This includes a population of ∼ 169 OB
stars, the most massive of which is ∼ 100M with an age of
∼ 2 Myr. Cyg OB2 does not exhibit evidence of mass segregation, whereby the most massive stars occupy regions with
the greatest gravitational potential (Wright et al. 2014b).
The initial mass function (IMF) at the high mass end
is not agreed upon in the literature, with many authors arriving at different conclusions (Massey & Thompson 1991;
Massey et al. 1995; Knödlseder 2000; Kiminki et al. 2007;
Wright et al. 2010; Comerón & Pasquali 2012). Wright et al.
(2015) take into account massive stars which have evolved
to their end state. In this way they find that the observed
stellar masses follow an IMF ζ(m) ∝ m−2.39±0.19 at high
masses, which is approximately consistent with the ‘universal’ IMF of Kroupa (2001) (or indeed a Salpeter 1955, IMF).
However, inferring the high mass IMF is problematic since
the occurance of supernovae in Cyg OB2 remains a point of
debate (see Butt et al. 2003 and discussion in Wright et al.
2015).
Wright et al. (2016) describe the spatial density distribution in Cyg OB2 with an Elson, Fall and Freeman profile
(EFF profile hereafter - Elson et al. 1987):


where astars = 7.5 pc and γ = 5.8. Normalising for the total mass of the cluster this makes the central mass density
ρ0 ≈ 22 M pc−3 . However, this profile was derived for a
small central region of ∼ 8 pc×8 pc, which does not enclose the estimated core radius. Hence, when we consider
the distribution of the stellar mass in our models (see Section 4.3.2) we will focus on reproducing the mass enclosed
within a projected radius of 13 pc (Wright et al. 2015).
2.2

Velocity dispersion

Wright et al. (2016) presented a high-precision proper motion study of the X-ray sources in Cyg OB2. They found
that the region is gravitationally unbound and exhibits an
anisotropic velocity dispersion with proper motion compo−1

be σr ∼ 10 km s−1 , although systematic overestimates due
to the binary fraction introduce uncertainties (Kiminki et al.
2007, 2008).
Interestingly Wright et al. (2016) found little evidence
for expansion (or contraction) in the velocity field when considering the large scale variations of the proper motion distribution. This finding is independent of the definition of
the centre of the association, and was argued by dividing
proper motions into radial and azimuthal components. The
ratio of kinetic energy between the radial and azimuthal directions was found to be approximately 60 : 40. In the radial
(projected) velocities, no bias is found towards or away from
the centre. Azimuthally there is some preference for a ratio
66 : 34 in favour of kinetic energy in the direction of negative
PA. Because Cyg OB2 is not bound, this is interpreted by
Wright et al. (2016) as a remnant of the angular momentum
of the primordial GMC.

2.3

Substructure

Interpretation of the internal substructure in Cyg OB2 is
not straightforward. Knödlseder (2000) concluded that it
is a spherically symmetric region with a diameter of ∼ 2◦
(46 pc). Since then, a number of authors have suggested a
more complex morphology:
• Bica et al. (2003) suggested that Cyg OB2 is home to
two open clusters which can be seen towards the centre.
However, Guarcello et al. (2013) note that the two apparent
clusters are divided by a bright nebula. This makes it unclear
if the two are physically separate or merely appear so due
to the higher extinction in the intervening region.
• Wright et al. (2010) found evidence of populations
within Cyg OB2 with distinct ages, 3.5+0.8
−1.0 Myr and
5.25+1.5
−1.0 Myr for central and northwestern regions respectively. Ostensibly, this suggests multiple star forming events.
However, the ages in physically separated regions exhibited
a wide spread such that they are almost consistent with being coeval. Further the authors acknowledge a number of
sources of uncertainty, including variability in pre-MS stars
(Herbst et al. 1994); binarity (Preibisch & Zinnecker 1999);
variable accretion (Baraffe et al. 2009); or non-uniform extinction (Guarcello et al. 2012).
• A large number of A stars were identified south of the
apparent centre by Drew et al. (2008). This population appears distinct spatially and non-coeval with the OB population (although the estimated ages ∼ 5–7 Myr are nearly
consistent with coevality within uncertainties). As the authors note, it is also possible that these stars are actually
behind Cyg OB2 along the line-of-sight and wrongly associated due to projection (Schneider et al. 2006).
• Guarcello et al. (2013) used a critical side length criterion in the mimimum spanning tree of the disc-bearing
population to suggest that Cyg OB2 has a clumpy substructure. However, as stated by the authors, the definitions of
these clumps are dependent on the definition of the critical
side length. Additionally the non-uniform extinction due to
foreground gas complicates this argument as in the case of
the two open clusters identified by Bica et al. (2003).
• Perhaps the best evidence for underlying structure in
Cyg OB2 has been the proper motion study of Wright et al.
(2016). On small scales they found evidence for kinematic

substructure, which is the correlation of proper motion vectors with position. Applying a Moran’s I statistic (Moran
1950) they found correlation with a significance of 9.7σ and
12.5σ in RA and Dec velocity components respectively.
2.4

PPD population

Guarcello et al. (2016) studied the correlation between the
fraction of surviving PPDs as a function of the local FUV
and EUV intensity. They use a sample of 7924 X-ray sources
(Wright et al. 2014a), for which the presence (absence) of
a PPD is inferred by the presence (absence) of an infrared
excess in the photometric data compiled from numerous surveys (see Guarcello et al. 2013). Subsequently they estimate
the local flux as a function of projected separation from each
O star (see Guarcello et al. 2007). The disc fractions as a
function of FFUV are divided into 6 bins between ∼ 103 G0
and ∼ 5 × 104 G0 . Over this space the disc fraction drops
monotonically from ∼ 40% to 18% with FUV intensity (see
figure 3 in Guarcello et al. 2016). These observations are
discussed in the context of modelling in Section 4.2.
2.5

Observational summary & modelling
challenges

Cyg OB2 is a well studied young association, and as such a
large number of physical characteristics serve as constraints
and measures for the success of any modelling attempts.
Some such metrics are as follows:
• Wright et al. (2016) find that the velocity dispersion in
Cyg OB2 is anisotropic. This suggests that the stars share
the systematic large-scale velocity field of the primordial
GMC. We will find that such observations cannot be reproduced by simple models without underlying substructure,
and we consider the initial properties required in Section
4.3.1.
• Cyg OB2 presently has a central mass of ∼ 1.6×104 M
within 13 pc of the centre. Any dynamical model should
match this central density after evolving for the age of the
association (∼ 3 − 5 Myr). The initial stellar mass required
to maintain this central density is explored in Section 4.3.2.
• Although Cyg OB2 is gravitationally unbound with a
large velocity dispersion, there is no bias (inwards or outwards) in the radial component of kinetic energy. This apparently suggests a lack of recent rapid expansion, despite
the high velocities. When we consider our final N -body
model, we will explore what expansion metric we would ‘observe’ (Section 4.3.4).
• Statistical measures of the proper motion distribution
suggest kinematic substructure which is probably indicative
of stars travelling together as small virialised groups (Wright
et al. 2016). We consider evidence for kinematic substructure
for our final N -body model in Section 4.3.4.
• The disc fraction as a function of (projected) FUV field
strength (Guarcello et al. 2016) provides a constraint on the
length of time for which external photoevaporation has been
an efficient mechanism in Cyg OB2. This allows us to put
constraints on the gas expulsion timescale. We perform these
calculations to constrain the appropriate N -body model in
Section 4.2, then revisit the PPD properties obtained from
our final model in Section 4.4.

NUMERICAL METHOD

The goal of our models is to reproduce the observed dynamical properties of the stellar population and the observed fractions of surviving discs. The latter is achieved by tracking
the FUV flux experienced by PPDs evolving within a given
N -body model. In this section we discuss the modelling procedure applied to both the stellar dynamics (Section 3.1)
and the disc evolution (Section 3.2).

3.1

Kinematic modelling

The dynamical evolution of the stellar population is calculated using Nbody6++GPU (Wang et al. 2015). This is an
MPI/GPU accelerated version of Nbody6 (Spurzem 1999;
Aarseth 2003), and has built-in routines to deal with the
evolution of a stellar cluster within a (gas) potential. As the
stellar components of Cyg OB2 are presently highly supervirial, the latter feature is necessary for an initially virialised
state.

3.1.1

Gas potential

The complex nature of Cyg OB2 means that some simplifying assumptions are required for dynamical modelling. We
first assume that the cluster was initially in virial equilibrium due to the contribution to the gravitational potential
of the gas in the primordial association. This is achieved by
invoking a Plummer potential (for numerical convenience)
corresponding to a gas density profile:

−5/2
3Mgas
r2
ρgas =
1+ 2
4πagas
agas
where Mgas is the total gas mass, r is the radial distance from
the centre of the association, and agas is the scale parameter.
During initial tests, we have varied agas (and the stellar scale
parameter astars ), and although it has a mild effect on the
kinematic properties of our models, the exact value (within
order unity) is not crucially important. This is particularly
true in the stochastically defined initial conditions of substructured models (see Section 3.1.2 below), where kinematics are more dependent on the specific realisation. Physically
we expect agas & astar , and we fix astar = 7 pc (as there is
no clear evidence of past expansion) and agas = 10 pc.
For a Plummer density profile the specific gravitational
potential is:

where vi is the magnitude of the initial velocity of the ith

star. The total gas mass is chosen to maintain initial virial
equilibrium for a cluster with a given velocity dispersion.
Our prescription of gas removal introduces an expulsion
timescale τexp over which time the potential is removed. The
gas mass is reduced linearly such that Ṁgas = Mgas,0 /τexp .
We vary τexp to investigate how this affects the disc population due to extinction (see Section 4.2). We fix the time
at which gas expulsion is initiated to be τdelay = 1 Myr,
consistent with the age of the most massive stars in Cyg
OB2 (∼ 2 Myr) if the cluster age is 3 Myr (the period
for which we evolve the whole system). We further define
τgas ≡ τdelay + τexp . For a discussion of the influence of gas
expulsion on the dynamical state of a young cluster, see
Baumgardt & Kroupa (2007).
Clearly, while computationally necessary here, a Plummer potential is not a realistic reflection of the physical conditions of the primordial gas distribution during the embedded phase. Initially, gas density distributions would be
physically expected to trace the stellar density (since the
stars form from the gas). Subsequently we would expect gas
expulsion to occur as expanding bubbles from the most massive stars in the region (e.g. Dale & Bonnell 2011; Dale et al.
2014; Ali et al. 2018). In terms of the cluster evolution, we
therefore expect intra-clump or -filament potential to reduce
faster than inter-clump potential. The influence of a geometrically complex potential on the evolution of the stellar
population is certainly of interest for accurately reproducing
observed kinematics and spatial distributions. However, we
assume that the Plummer potential imposed here is sufficient for reproducing the global distribution of stellar positions and velocities. This is justified since we are primarily
interested in preventing the rapid escape of the high velocity
stars from the central regions of Cyg OB2. This is achieved
by our spherically symmetric potential.
3.1.2

Stellar initial conditions

We define three different types of stellar initial condition,
which we label uniform (UNIF), fractal (FRAC), and filamentary (FILA). A uniform cluster exhibits no underlying substructure, while fractal and filamentary clusters have enhanced local number densities, and stellar positions are correlated with velocities. While the surface density of FRAC
model is ‘clumpy’, and individual clumps can be spatially
isolated, a FILA model is defined such that the (radially
binned) surface density follows an EFF profile. A filamentary model captures the morphology seen in both observations and simulations of star forming regions (e.g. Bonnell
et al. 2008; Molinari et al. 2010; André et al. 2014), however
we include both FRAC and FILA models in this work to compare their properties by the metrics of interest. We discuss
the generation of each set of initial conditions below.
The simplest initial conditions are UNIF models for
which stellar positions are simply drawn from an EFF profile (equation 1, Elson et al. 1987). We fix γ = 5.8, consistent with the present day value, and fix astars = 7 pc. The
magnitude of the velocities are then chosen from a MaxwellBoltzmann distribution
f (v) ∝ v 2 exp(−v 2 )

(4)

with a random direction, then normalised as discussed in
Section 3.1.1. We note that drawing from this distribution

Figure 1. Example initial position distribution of stars in FRAC and FILA models (figures 1a and 1b respectively). In the FRAC model,
stellar positions are distributed with a ‘clumpy’ morphology, whereas the FILA model exhibits extended filaments. A subset of 5000 stars
within a cube of side length 10 pc are shown, where the coordinate system is defined by the gas potential (see text for details). Both
models have a stellar mass of 104 M and the same half mass as an EFF profile with astars = 7 pc, γ = 5.8; the FILA model also follows
the same radial density profile (equation 1 with the aforementioned parameters). The scatter points are coloured by the largest scale
subgroup with which they are associated and scaled linearly by the mass of the star.

(particularly at the high velocity dispersions we require see Section 4.3.1) will produce a significant number of unbound stars. It is possible that this distribution is truncated
at large velocities, and indeed star formation models suggest stars might have a smaller velocity dispersion than the
priomordial gas (Offner et al. 2009, see Section 4.3.3).
A FRAC model is generated using the recipe fully described by Goodwin & Whitworth (2004) which we briefly
review here (see also Scally & Clarke 2002; Craig &
Krumholz 2013). First we define a cube with side length
2 (in arbitrary units) centred at the origin. We then divide
it up into (2P0 )3 sub-cubes, where P0 is an integer (initially
chosen to be unity) which dictates the number of largest
scale sub-clusters. The centre of each of these represent the
potential positions for the first generation of stars, g = 1.
All positions are offset by a vector with magnitude uniformly
drawn between 0 and 2−(g+1) /P0 , and random (isotropically
drawn) direction. ‘Parent’ positions rg have 8 possible sites
for ‘child’ positions rg+1 which are placed with a probability
2D0 −3 , where D0 ≤ 3 is the fractal dimension (which we fix
at 2.5). Only existing children can parent future generations.
We repeat this process until the number of positions greatly
exceeds the number of stars in the model, at which point
the members are randomly allocated to positions. The side
length of the original cube is then redefined such that the
initial half-mass radius matches that of an equivalent UNIF
model with parameters astars = 7 pc, γ = 5.8.
The velocities for each generation of stars g = 1 is chosen in the same way as for the UNIF model. Velocities for
subsequent generations vg+1 are correlated to the velocity
of the parent star vg :
vg+1 = vg + δvg+1
where δvg is a velocity with a random direction and magnitude δvg . The latter is drawn from the modified MaxwellMNRAS 000, 1–20 (2018)

Boltzmann distribution
f (δv) ∝ δv 2 exp −2g δv 2



such that child stars have velocities correlated to their parents.
A FILA model is a hybrid between FRAC and UNIF. To
construct the initial conditions we first produce a FRAC model
and then force the stellar positions into an EFF profile. This
is achieved by dividing the radial positions into bins, with
the j th bin containing Nc,j stars approximately at radius
rc,j , and rescaling the size of each bin (∆rc,j ) from inside
out to produce the appropriate number density with respect
to imposed EFF profile:
ρ(rc,j )
Nc,j
=
2
4πrc,j
∆rc,j
hmstar i
where hmstar i is the average stellar mass and ρ(r) is defined
in equation 1.
The results of this process are filament-like structures,
as shown in figure 1, in which FRAC and FILA models are compared. In a FRAC model the density profile has hard edges
and a clump-like substructure (as in figure 1a), while in the
FILA model stellar density drops off smoothly with radius
and produces filament-like substructure (as in figure 1b).
This is because the initial clumps from which the stellar
density is composed become ‘stretched’ radially when we
impose the EFF profile, to produce several elongated distributions of stars. Both types of model demonstrate spatial
and kinematic asymmetry with respect to the gas potential.

where at high mass end > 1 M we use the observed mass
function in Cyg OB2 (Wright et al. 2015). In our models
stars are not primordially mass segregated.
Reproducing observations requires estimating an appropriate field of view, which is in turn dependent on the definition of the cluster centre. Observationally some discrepancy
exists in this definition between different works, although authors generally agree within a few pc (see Wright et al. 2016,
for a discussion). For our purposes an approximate estimate
of this centre is sufficient as we find that all of the metrics we
consider are only weakly dependent on our choice. For UNIF
models, the cluster centre remains the centre of mass of the
original set up. For FILA and FRAC models, where considerable anistropy exists in the stellar kinematic distribution, it
is necessary to estimate the centre of mass for each snapshot
in time. We choose an efficient (approximate) algorithm, in
which we find the point which maximises the mass within a
given projected radius (chosen to be Rcent = 10 pc) by sampling recursively over a grid of points. Providing the grid is
sufficiently highly resolved, the centre we obtain is insensitive to the exact value of Rcent and number of iterations. All
subsequent results should be understood in this context.

Disc evolution model

In this section we discuss the prescription we apply to calculate PPD evolution. Each disc is exposed to an FUV flux
resulting from tracking the contributions from the stellar
components within a given N -body model.
3.2.1

FUV flux and mass loss rate

Flux in the FUV energy range ( 6 eV< hν < 13.6 eV2 )
is the most efficient contributer to external photoevaporation of PPDs in an intermediate regime of distances from
massive stars. As discussed in Winter et al. (2018b), extreme ultraviolet radiation can also contribute to the thermal wind, however it only dominates the mass loss rate in
regions where FUV flux is low (FFUV . 50 G0 ) or very high
(FFUV & 105 G0 ). Both of these thresholds lie outside the
region of interest in Cyg OB2. Additionally, in these cases
disc destruction timescales are extremely long and short respectively, and the additional mass loss contributed by EUV
flux in young massive clusters is therefore not significant to
our consideration of the survival rates of discs on a timescale
of Myr.
To calculate the FUV luminosity for a star of a given
stellar mass we apply the precription discussed by Armitage (2000) and Winter et al. (2018b). Model grids of
Schaller et al. (1992) contain the total luminosities and effective temperatures of stars of a given mass, for which
we use the results for metallicity Z = 0.02 and the output age closest to 1 Myr. We then obtain the wavelength dependent luminosity from the atmosphere models of Castelli & Kurucz (2004). In this way we obtain an
FUV luminosity for all stars with a mass m in the range
1 M < m < 100 M .
For the FUV induced mass loss rates Ṁwind we use the

The grid covers a wide range of parameter space in outer
disc radius (1 – 400 au), disc masses (∼ 10−8 – 0.1 M ),
FUV field strengths (10 – 104 G0 ) and stellar masses (0.05 –
1.9 M ). These mass loss rates are interpolated linearly and
applied to a viscously evolving disc to establish the expected
disc properties in a given cluster environment.

3.2.2

Viscous disc evolution

To calculate the state of PPDs evolving within the cluster we must take into account vicous expansion as well
as the photoevaporative mass loss. The viscous disc evolution is modelled using the method of Clarke (2007, and
subsequently Anderson et al. 2013, Rosotti et al. 2017 and
Winter et al. 2018b). In such a paramerisation, viscosity is
assumed to scale linearly with radius r within the disc, corresponding to a constant α-viscosity parameter (Shakura &
Sunyaev 1973) and a temperature which scales with r−1/2 .
The accretion rate at the inner edge of the disc is initially

where Mdisc,0 is the initial disc mass, H1 and Ω1 are the scale

host mass. The scale height H is proportional to the radius throughout the disc, and we choose H1 /R1 = 0.05. The

During the course of this work we will explore the effect of altering disc initial conditions on their final properties, however we always consider a distribution of initial disc
masses. Allowing a range of initial disc masses accounts for
the observed range of stellar ages (since internal processes
deplete the disc over time) and variable disc initial conditions. Additionally, for a given FUV flux environment some
fraction of discs survive, and the findings of Guarcello et al.
(2016) indicate that this survival fraction reduces monotonically with increasing FFUV . We find that, depending on initial disc properties, dynamical mixing between regions of
different FUV flux and the range of FFUV within a single bin
alone are insufficient to produce the observed survival fractions (i.e. observed survival fractions between FFUV bins do
not jump rapidly from ∼ 0% to ∼ 100% at a certain threshold). The chosen initial conditions and the variation between
discs are therefore important in reproducing observations.
Whether or not this dispersion is inherited from a tight correlation between stellar mass and PPD initial conditions is
explored by considering host mass independent disc models
in Section 4.4.3.
Using the initial conditions described above we calculate the evolution of the disc over a 1D grid, spaced evenly in
r1/2 . The cell at the inner edge has a zero torque boundary
condition, and the cell at the outer edge experiences mass
depletion due to the photoevaporation induced wind (i.e. for
a given mass loss rate Ṁwind , the disc material is removed
from the outer edge). The edge cell is then redefined depending on whether there is net mass loss or mass accumulation
(see Section 4.2 in Winter et al. 2018b).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1

Modelling approach

We aim to produce an N -body model, including initial gas
potential, with a self-consistent treatment for the photoevaporation of the PPD population. We simplify the modelling
procedure by the following approach:
(i) First we estimate the gas expulsion timescale τgas ≡
MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2018)

7

τdelay + τexp by considering the observed surviving disc fractions as a function of FUV field strength (Section 4.2). The
presence of primordial gas influences the models in two ways:
it imposes a gravitational potential on the stellar population, and suppresses photoevaporation by extincting FUV
photons. Using the latter effect we can calibrate the period
of efficient exposure to the observed survival rate of PPDs.
There exists a degeneracy in this calculation with the assumed disc viscosity, and we explore the influence of varying
both parameters (see Section 4.2).
(ii) Having established the rate of gas expulsion, we apply the appropriate time-dependent potential to establish
the dynamical evolution of the stellar population consistent with kinematic and spatial data. In Section 4.3.1 we
deduce the initial conditions required to reproduce the observed anistropic velocity dispersion. In Section 4.3.2 we vary
the initial stellar mass required to reproduce the observed
central density (within 13 pc of the apparent centre).
(iii) Finally we combine our findings into a ‘best-fitting’
model, and explore the evolution of PPDs over time in Section 4.4. This allows us both to test whether external photoevaporation is a viable mechanism for disc depletion in Cyg
OB2 and to make predictions regarding the disc properties
for future observations.
4.2

Disc fractions and gas expulsion

We first estimate the influence of the timescale for gas expulsion on the PPD population survival fractions. A number
of physical effects must be taken into account when considering the statistical distribution of disc fractions. Most obviously, projection effects can lead to a distribution of physical
distances between stars for every apparent (projected) separation, and therefore a range of FFUV . Binarity and the
initial PPD properties will also influence the total disc fraction. However, to first order, the steepness of the drop-off of
the disc fraction with FFUV indicates the length of time for
which external photoevaporation has been an efficient mechanism for disc destruction in a given enivironment. Initial
tests suggest that a massive gas mass (& 106 M ) is required
to maintain virial equilibrium in the primordial Cyg OB2.
Due to extinction of FUV photons, this gas mass is sufficient
to dramatically reduce photoevaporation efficiency.
The current PPD population therefore allows us to constrain when the gas component of Cyg OB2 was expelled.
The relatively short period of expulsion (. 2 Myr) means
that we are free to consider the influence of FUV photons on
disc evolution from the time τgas at which gas is completely
removed. Practically this means that we can apply a simplified UNIF model with the present day mass and ‘switch
on’ photoevaporation at different times. We then compare
the disc fractions as a function of FUV flux after 3 Myr
of evolution, and thus estimate the gas expulsion timescale.
The FUV flux in those bins is calculated in the same way
as in Guarcello et al. (2016), using the projected distance
between stars - this we call ‘projected’ FFUV (as opposed to
‘real’ FFUV , as experienced by a given disc). As an estimate
of the influence of dynamical mixing between projected FUV
flux bins, we start with a stellar velocity dispersion 17 km/s
and hold the stars in virial equilibrium with an external potential.
The rate at which irradiated discs are destroyed is also

This value for α is effectively an upper limit since we assume that extinction efficiently shuts off photoevaporation before all gas is
expelled.

dependent on the α-viscosity parameter (Section 3.2.2). The
chosen α dictates the rate at which a disc viscously expands
into a region where photoevaporation rates are high, as well
as dictating mass loss through accretion. This adds a degeneracy to our approach which, given uncertainties in α, introduces similar uncertainties in τgas . We investigate this degeneracy by calculating surviving PPD fractions for a number

of different values for τgas (1, 2, 2.5 and 2.75 Myr) and α
(5 × 10−3 , 10−2 , 2 × 10−2 ).
We calculate disc evolution for a subset of discs with
host stars in the mass range 0.5 – 2 M . Stars less massive
than this are not present in the sample used by Guarcello
et al. (2016), while the disc mass loss rates calculated by
Haworth et al. (2018b) do not apply for higher mass stars.

Stellar population properties

In this section we consider the initial conditions for our N body models of the stellar population of Cyg OB2. We proceed by first aiming to reproduce the observed velocity dispersion in the region by varying the initial velocity distribution and substructure (Section 4.3.1). Subsequently we
match the observed central density by varying the initial
stellar mass (Section 4.3.2).

4.3.1

Velocity dispersion, anisotropy and substructure

In terms of the stellar population, the first observable quantity we aim to reproduce is the central velocity dispersion
and its anisotropy (hv 2 i1/2 ≈ 17 km/s, and the proper motion dispersions σα,δ & σr the line of sight component – see
Wright et al. 2016). This is because it is not strongly sensitive to the initial stellar mass of the cluster. We demonstrate
this by considering UNIF cluster models (where cluster conditions are relatively non-stochastic) for a range of initial
3D velocity dispersions and stellar masses; we plot the resuts in figure 4. As the potential is dominated by the gas in
the cluster, and the stellar component is itself highly supervirial, the final central velocity dispersion is insensitive the
total stellar mass.

A disc is considered destroyed if it has a mass < 10−5 M ,
which is estimated by Guarcello et al. (2013) as a limit below which SEDs are more difficult to interpret. In fact discs
of such low mass (∼ 10−5 M ) are destroyed quickly in regions of strong FUV fields, so our results are insensitive to
the exact value of this threshold.
The results of this preliminary modelling procedure compared with the observational findings of
Guarcello et al. (2016) are summarised in figure 3. We expect disc fractions at lower FFUV are overestimated as we do
not consider other disc dispersal processes (such as internal
photoevaporation, see Section 4.4). We therefore focus on
matching disc fractions in regions of higher FFUV . We find
that τgas = 2.5 Myr and α = 10−2 give a good fit to the data
for projected FFUV & 3000 G0 . Since we have assumed 100%
extinction of FUV photons before gas is completely expelled,
this α is an upper limit. As discussed above, reducing the
expulsion timescale to τgas = 1 Myr while decreasing the
viscosity such that α = 5 × 10−3 also yields the correct disc
fractions. However, if gas ejection was initiated at the time
of formation of the most massive stars (∼ 2 Myr) this would
suggest instantaneous expulsion, which is not physical. In
this case early supernovae may be responsible for driving
gas mass loss (see discussion in Section 2.1). However, for
short τgas Cyg OB2 must have had a extremely large initial stellar mass to maintain the present day central density
( 105 M , see Section 4.3.2 and figure 7), which is neither
supported by observations nor computationally practicable
for the range of models we wish to explore.
While the simplified model presented in this section is
not an accurate representation of the dynamical conditions
in the region, it represents a first-order approximation on
which we can base our choice of kinematic parameters in
Section 4.3. We will again consider the disc fractions for a
more realistic model in Section 4.4.

Figure 4. The components of the velocity dispersion (σα , σδ
and σr , where σr is the line of sight component) in our model
using the Wright et al. (2016) field of view after 3 Myr of evolution versus the initial three dimensional velocity dispersion
over the entire cluster, hv02 i1/2 . The initial conditions are nonsubstructured (UNIF) and have initial parameters agas = 10 pc,
astars = 7 pc, τexp = 1.5 Myr and two different stellar masses
Mstars = 1.6 · 104 M , 4 · 104 M (black and green lines respectively). The horizontal red line
√ represents the mean observed 1D
velocity dispersion hv 2 i1/2 / 3 ≈ 10 km s−1 . The radial (line of
sight) velocity dispersion σr > σα,δ due to projection effects and
velocity sorting. Observationally we require a model such that the
1D velocity dispersion components are of the same order (in fact
observations indicate σα,δ & σr ). This is not reproduced by the
UNIF model.

Figure 4 demonstrates that UNIF models fail to reproduce the observed velocity dispersion. This is because in a
non-substructured model we find supressed proper motion
velocity dispersions σα,δ with respect to the radial component σr , since stars with high velocities in the plane of the
sky preferentially leave the central field of view over time
(velocity sorting). To remedy this, we need to incorporate
substructure into our model.
To demonstrate the influence of substructure on the
components of the velocity dispersion within a finite field
of view, we run FILA and FRAC models with large scale substructure (P0 = 1), and rotate a snapshot at 3 Myr such
that the radial velocity dispersion is approximately minimised. The results of this process are shown in figure 5,
where the decomposed velocity components are again compared with the initial three dimensional velocity dispersion.
The anisotropies in the velocity dispersion are reproduced
in both FILA and FRAC cluster models.
The degree of anisotropy in the velocity dispersion is
dependent on the scale of substructure. Figure 6 shows the
results for initially smaller filaments/clumps (using P0 = 2).

Figure 5. The components of the velocity dispersion (σα,δ,r ) as
in figure 4 but for a fixed stellar mass Mstars = 1.6 · 104 M .
Instead of the UNIF model in figure 4, the black lines represent
the case for a FILA cluster model and the green lines are for a
FRAC cluster model, both with P0 = 1 and D0 = 2.5. In this case
the large scale substructure gives rise to much greater stochastic
variations in the relative 1D velocity dispersions, and is consistent
with observations.

Figure 6. The same as in figure 5 but with smaller scale substructure (P0 = 2). In this case the scale of substructure is insufficient
to result in proper motion velocity dispersions comparable to the
radial dispersion (we have σα,δ < σr ).

While there still exist stochastic fluctuations in the components of the velocity dispersion, the degree of anisotropy
is not sufficient to yield proper motion velocity dispersions
greater than the radial component. This suggests that the
initial region consisted of large clumps or filaments of mass
∼ 104 M .
We estimate that the required initial velocity dispersion
in Cyg OB2 is hv02 i1/2 ∼ 50 km/s, although the stochasticity
of the substructured models makes precise estimates impractical. In future models we will assume this is the initial three
dimensional velocity dispersion. Other required parameters,
such as the initial stellar mass, are chosen to be consistent
with this property.

mains within a 13 pc projected radius (approximately a
quarter in each case). As in the case of our velocity investigation, this is due to the fact that that the stellar component
of the potential energy is much smaller than the total kinetic
energy.
The central mass in all of our models undergoes a similar temporal evolution. In figure 7 we see an initial rapid
mass loss as stars with the highest energies escape the potential. This is because we do not truncate the velocity dispersion such that escapers are initially forbidden; it is not clear
whether or not this is physically realistic, and the effect of
choosing such initial conditions is discussed in Section 4.3.3
in the context of primordial gas mass. However, since stars
which escape the central regions are not considered in our
PPD models and the gravitational potential is dominated by
the gas component, whether or not these early escapers are
initially included in the model is of secondary importance.
After this initial decline in mass, some high energy stars
remain bound, and therefore return to the central regions,
causing a modest oscillation in the mass. This is again a consequence of using a Boltzmann velocity distribution without
truncating the high velocity end. The magnitude of this oscillation is more variable for substructured regions where velocities (and therefore kinetic energies) are correlated. Gas
expulsion (starting at τdelay = 1 Myr and continuing over
τexp = 1.5 Myr) results in a decrease in gravitational potential, and as the number of stars with energies sufficient to
escape increases, the central mass decreases.

4.3.2

Central mass

We wish to alter the initial stellar mass such that the central
density at the end of the simulation is consistent with observations. A cluster model with a central mass of 1.6 × 104 M
after 3 Myr of evolution is required, where hv02 i1/2 = 50 km/s
as discussed in Section 4.3.1. To find the appropriate initial
mass we run UNIF, FRAC and FILA models at stellar masses
Mstars = 2×104 M , 4×104 M and 8×104 M . The results
are shown in figure 7. We find that Mstars = 8 × 104 M (figure 7c) is sufficient to yield the required central mass after
3 Myr of evolution.
Neither the initial mass nor the substructure has a significant effect on the fraction of the stellar mass which re-

in Table 1, which fits observations of the stellar population.
While we refer to this as our ‘best-fit’ model, this is to be

of the appropriate parameters, and not as the optimisation

models we find gas expulsion was completed ∼ 0.5 Myr ago
(for a PPD viscous timescale of 0.5 Myr), the initial velocity
dispersion was ∼ 50 km/s and the initial cluster mass was
∼ 8 × 104 M . We further suggest that the largest scales
of initial coherent clumps within the primordial Cyg OB2
had a mass of ∼ 104 M . No significant dynamical differences can be found between FRAC and FILA type models at
the present time, and we hereafter use a FILA model in our
analysis of the disc population (Section 4.4).

early on in the cluster evolution and therefore the required
initial stellar mass. It would also reduce the gas mass necessary for virial equilibrium as Mgas ∝ hv 2 i if Mgas  Mstars
(equation 3). If our gas mass estimate is accurate then this
makes the star formation efficiency ∼ 1%, although this is
probably a lower limit (an upper limit on Mgas ).

The gas mass required for initial virial equilibrium is
Mgas ∼ 8 · 106 M (with a scale parameter agas = 10 pc).
This would make the primordial GMC massive compared to
known Milky Way molecular clouds, although the census is
not complete (see Longmore et al. 2014, for a review). It is
also possible that the initial velocity dispersion is overestimated due to the truncation of equation 4 at high velocities
(simulations suggest stars have a subvirial initial velocity
dispersion with respect to the primordial gas - see Offner
et al. 2009; Kruijssen 2012). While this would not influence
the central velocity dispersion (high velocity stars leave the
centre in any case) it would reduce the number of escapers

(Wright et al. 2016). We find that determining these metrics is problematic for a given cluster model. This is because
the values obtained differ stochastically depending on initial conditions, the time of ‘observation’ and the subset of
stars used in taking a measurement. To obtain an accurate
probability of finding the observed values for these metrics,
a large number of models would need to be tested, which
would be computationally expensive. However, for our chosen model the velocity field is illustrated in figure 8. We find

disc population in our model, checking that the population
is consistent with the known disc fractions in the region.
Subsequently we will explore predictions for the disc mass
and radius distribution relevant for future observations in

is clear (figure 8a), while figure 8b does not show clear evidence of expansion. However, the stellar components are in
fact expanding globally since they are unbound.
To illustrate this point more fully, we define the expansion parameter:
E=

T+
T− + T+

(10)

where T +/− is defined as the total kinetic energy of stars directed in the postive/negative projected radial direction (in
the plane of the sky). Thus E → 1 or 0 if the velocity dispersion indicates rapid expansion or contraction respectively. A
value of E ≈ 0.5 would usually be taken as evidence that
a stellar population is not expanding. In Figure 9 we show
the cumulative distribution of the measured expansion parameter for random subsets of 800 stars in the Wright et al.
(2016) field of view (the central 8 pc × 8 pc). We find that
a wide range of values for E is possible at any given time.
Depending on the time at which the velocities are observed
and the chosen subsample, our model is found to be consistent with an observed value E ≈ 0.5. This is because the
E distribution varies considerably and non-monotonically in
time even for a single model. However, at any given time
the stellar population is expanding (filaments are moving
away from each other). Alternative geometrical signatures
may be more successful at gauging such expansion. Due to
the stochasticity and wide range of possible E values for our
model, we conclude that E alone is not a sufficient metric to
draw conclusions on the expansion of a substructured association. For further discussion on the kinematic indicators

Disc properties

In what follows we will consider a FILA model with the properties described in Table 1. We fix the α-viscosity of the disc
population with the derived value α = 10−2 (Section 4.2).
As in Section 4.2 all discs are assumed to have an initial mass
that is uniformly distributed between 1 – 10% of their host
star mass (see Section 3.2.2), and scale radius as in equation
8. We consider the same range of stellar masses 0.5 – 2 M
and calculate the evolution of a subset of 5000 discs.

4.4.1

Disc fractions in best-fit model

The disc fraction distribution in our best-fit model after
∼ 3 Myr is summarised by figure 10, in which we show
the surviving disc fraction as a function of projected FUV
flux (figure 10a) with the spatial distribution and projected
FFUV in figure 10b. We find that after 3 Myr the number of
surviving discs is slightly overestimated in our model, particularly at the lower FUV fluxes. There are two reasons why
we expect this to be the case. Firstly, extinction in the FUV
may decrease before gas is fully removed from the cluster. If
gas is expelled due to the flux from massive stars, then the
central, highly irradiated environments would become less
dense and allow efficient photoevaporation at earlier times.
Additionally, clumpy gas distributions may have a similar
effect in reducing extinction during this period. Secondly,
internal photoevaporation due to the stellar host depletes
the gas content even when a PPD evolves in isolation. This
speeds up destruction timescales, particularly in regions of
lower FFUV , where the mass loss rates induced by internal
and external photoevaporation become comparable.
The influence of the above considerations is uncertain and we therefore do not attempt to model them here.
Our model does however reproduce the correct disc fractions within a reasonable period of time, particularly at
FFUV & 3000 G0 . We conclude that the observations of
Guarcello et al. (2016) can be explained by external photoevaporation of the PPD population in Cyg OB2.

4.4.2

Disc mass and FUV flux environment

To make predictions about the disc population in Cyg OB2
for comparison with future observations we consider PPD
mass as a function of FUV flux (figure 11). We find that, if
used in isolation, the local flux experienced by a given star
is a poor predictor of the disc mass. Correlation with real or
projected FUV flux only becomes clear when the host mass,
to which the final PPD mass is closely correlated (as demonstrated by the colour gradient in figure 11 and discussed in
Section 4.4.3), is also taken into account. In particular, we

expect that low mass stars (< 1 M ) in the centre of Cyg
OB2 host exclusively low mass discs (. 10−3 M , if any).
Without taking into account stellar mass, can we find
differences in disc properties between PPDs in apparently
high versus low FUV flux environments? To answer this, we
must consider the sensitivity limit for future observations.
Considering ALMA band 6 sensitivity, reasonable integration times (∼ 30 minutes) for a survey sample suggest flux
densities down to Fν (850 µm) ∼ 40 µJy can be detected. At
the distance of Cyg OB2 this means that dust masses can be
established down to a few M⊕ (Andrews & Williams 2005).
The corresponding total disc masses are Mdisc ∼ 10−3 M
if the gas to dust ratio is Σgas /Σdust = 102 . Given that the
PPDs are likely to be gas depleted by external photoevaporation, the latter assumption is probably not accurate for
many discs (Ansdell et al. 2016), and this complicates the
interpretation of observations. Nonetheless, we show the cumulative PPD mass fraction after 3 Myr for two FUV flux
bins in figure 12. While disc masses are indeed suppressed
at higher projected FUV flux, considering the sensitivity
limit of ALMA makes finding differences between the two
populations impractical. A sample of several 100s of PPDs
would be required to find a difference between the total population in high and low FUV flux environments (including
non-detections). We find that similar sample sizes would be
required to find differences in disc outer radius distributions
in the two environments.

Figure 13. As in figure 10a but for a distribution of initial disc

This demonstrates that reproducing the observed disc fractions
is not sensitive to the choice of PPD initial conditions.

4.4.3

Stellar mass independent disc initial conditions

In obtaining the results in Section 4.4.2 we have already assumed that the initial disc mass is dependent on the stellar
mass of the host. We wish to confirm our results are not sensitive to this assumption. We therefore recalculate the PPD
evolution in our model under the assumption that the initial
disc mass is uncorrelated to the stellar mass. To this end we
draw the initial disc masses from a log-normal distribution:
Mdisc,0 /M = eµ+σX
where the random variable X ∼ N (0, 1) is drawn from a
standard normal distribution, uncorrelated with mstar . The
values of µ = −3.25 and σ = 0.7 are chosen such that the
mean and dispersion of Mdisc,0 match those chosen for the
stellar mass dependent initial conditions. The scale radius
R1 is again defined according to equation 8. This distribution of initial conditions recovers similar disc fractions as a
function of projected FFUV (figure 13). The resulting disc
mass distribution is shown in figure 14. Our findings do not
differ greatly from those in figure 11, except for a predictable
weaker correlation between final disc mass and host mass.

4.4.4

Disc mass dependence on host mass

The relationship between final disc mass and stellar mass
is considered in figure 15a (figure 15b) for disc masses initially correlated (uncorrelated) with the host star mass. We
obtain power law indices (Mdisc ∝ mβstar ) β = 3.93 ± 0.11
and 2.75 ± 0.12 respectively. In both cases this is a substantially more superlinear relationship than in local PPD

populations that have not been significantly photoevaporated (1 < β < 1.9 Andrews et al. 2013; Pascucci et al.
2016). Physically this is because Ṁwind is strongly dependent on stellar mass such that discs around low mass stars
are depleted much faster (due to a shallower potential) than
those around high mass stars for a fixed flux and disc radius
(Haworth et al. 2018b). In regions where a disc population
has undergone significant photoevaporation we then expect
lower mass stars to host lower mass PPDs. Even if it proves
impossible to obtain sufficiently large samples of mm-based
mass determinations in Cyg OB2 in order to conduct the
comparison made in figure 12, an alternative way to test
the role of external photoevaporation would be to examine
any evidence for steep disc mass–stellar mass relationship.
Indeed, Ansdell et al. (2017) find a steepening of the relationship with age across different regions that could be due
to external photoevaporation. To the contrary, Eisner et al.
(2018) find a shallow disc mass–host mass relationship in
the strongly irradiated discs of the Orion Nebula Cluster;
this could be the result of the youth or complex formation
history of the stellar population (Beccari et al. 2017; Kroupa
et al. 2018). Disentangling these effects requires a detailed
modelling of those regions, such as that presented in this
paper.
To estimate whether detecting large β values is possible in Cyg OB2, we extract a subset of 20 discs from our
model, choosing them such that they lie in a region of projected FUV flux 3000 G0 < FFUV < 8000 G0 . A lower limit
of 3000 G0 is appropriate since below this figures 10a and
13 suggest that alternative processes to external photoevaporation have a comparable influence on disc evolution. We
also select stellar masses to be approximately uniformly distributed between 0.5 – 2 M . We assume error of 30% in
Mdisc , with Mdisc < 10−3 M constituting a non-detection,
and a 10% error in Mstar . We then attempt to fit a power

law using the Linmix package (Kelly 2007) for a number of
different PPD subsets. An illustrative example of such an
exploration is shown in figure 16. In all cases we find that
the fit effectively discounts power law relations with β ≤ 1.9.
Values of β ≤ 1.9 are similarly discounted in the model with
stellar host mass independent disc initial conditions. Our
findings suggest that, if a sample is carefully selected, evidence of external photoevaporation should be detectable in
future observations of Cyg OB2.
One might ask whether it is possible to find signatures
of underlying substructure within a population of PPDs.
Given that the dynamical history is linked to the irradiation by FUV photons, it may be possible to detect distinct
groups in the mass distribution of a disc sample. As discussed previously, in an externally photoevaporated population, disc properties are more strongly correlated with host
mass than FUV flux. Therefore considering disc properties
as a function of host mass is the best chance of finding distinct groups within a sample. This possibility is explored in
figure 15, where the largest scale fractal membership is indicated for each PPD. We find that the mass distribution
does not demonstrate a clear segregation between groups.
The subgroups are in themselves massive (∼ 104 M ) and
the high mass end of the IMF is therefore well sampled in
each filament. It is possible that for smaller scale substructure (with filaments of mass < 103 M , see Winter et al.
2018b) a less well sampled IMF might mean that different
filaments have quite different local FFUV . In this case we
should expect to see a distinct PPD mass and outer radius
distributions between filaments.
4.4.5

Disc radii

An alternative observable property, the outer disc radius
Rout , may prove to be a better probe of substructure in
future observations. This is because, while Mdisc is depleted
over the entire lifetime of the disc, the outer radius in regions
of strong FUV flux is set by a balance between photoevaporative mass loss and viscous expansion on short timescales.
We have so far neglected discussion of disc radius simply
because resolving disc radii down to ∼ 10s au is challenging in a region such as Cyg OB2; the highest resolution of
ALMA is ∼ 0.0200 , corresponding to ∼ 30 au at 1.33 kpc distance. However, because it may be possible to resolve disc
radii to sufficient accuracies in closer young stellar environments, we illustrate the distribution of disc radii in figure 17.
There are some indications of different radius distributions
between different fractal associations, but no clear segregation between them. The majority of discs have Rdisc < 60 au
which would require < 0.0500 resolution at the distance of
Cyg OB2. We note that outer disc radius measurements can
be subject to large uncertainties, and that the dust emission is frequently less extended than the gas (e.g. Birnstiel
et al. 2010; Guilloteau et al. 2011; de Gregorio-Monsalvo
et al. 2013). This discrepancy may be less problematic in regions where disc radii are externally suppressed (for example
close stellar encounters may result in wavelength independent PPD outer radius measurements, as in the case of the
disc around HV Tau C - Monin & Bouvier 2000; Winter
et al. 2018c). This assumption requires further study into
gas-dust physics in externally photoevaporating discs (see
Cleeves et al. 2016 for discussion of gas and dust evolution

in an FUV irradiated PPD). Overall we see the same trend
as in disc masses that the outer radius is correlated with
host mass. This is again because Ṁwind decreases with mstar ,
such that the radius at which viscous expansion is in equilibrium with FUV induced mass loss is more extended for
more massive host stars.

CONCLUSIONS

Using N -body simulations and viscous disc evolution models
we have successfully reproduced the properties of Cygnus
OB2, including the stellar kinematics and the surviving PPD
fractions as a function of projected FUV flux. Our modelling
supports the following scenario:
• If the viscous evolution of PPDs is well described by a
Shakura & Sunyaev α-parameter α = 10−2 (τvisc ≈ 0.5 Myr
for a solar mass star), then expulsion of the primordial gas
content in the region must have concluded ∼ 0.5 Myr ago.
Approximately 0.5 Myr of exposure to strong FUV fields
is required to reproduce the current disc survival rates as
a function of (projected) flux. This value of α will be an
upper limit if FUV extinction due to the primordial gas was
not efficient (because of a clumpy spatial distribution, for
example).
• The initial three dimensional velocity dispersion must
have been ∼ 50 km/s in order to be consistent with the
present day central velocity dispersion. This is large with
respect to observed stellar populations, even for OB associations (e.g. Ward & Kruijssen 2018 and references therein).
However, velocity gradients ∼ 10 kms−1 pc−1 are found
MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2018)

across giant molecular clouds, particularly in the case of
cloud-cloud collision (Wu et al. 2015; Bisbas et al. 2018;
Pols et al. 2018).
• Anisotropy in the present day velocity dispersion requires the presence of primordial subtructure. We find that
Cyg OB2 must have been comprised of large scale filaments
(or fractal clumps), with a mass ∼ 104 M .
• In such a model, a gas content of ∼ 8 × 106 M is required to maintain initial virial equilibrium. This is massive compared to the known distribution of molecular cloud
masses in the Milky Way (Longmore et al. 2014).
• The total stellar mass required to sustain a sufficient
central mass after 3 Myr is ∼ 8 × 104 M . This suggests a
star formation efficiency of ∼ 1%.
• The apparent lack of expansion measured by
Wright et al. (2016) need not be interpreted as evidence of no physical expansion of the stellar population.
We find that our (expanding) model is equally consistent
with an expansion parameter E ≈ 0.5. Such a measurement
can only be interpreted probabilistically for an association
with large scale substructure.
The primary caveat of these conclusions is that the gas
expulsion timescale derived by disc fractions is degenerate
with α. Our choice (α = 10−2 , although this is in turn dependent on choice of scale radius R1 - see equation 9) yields
a good fit to the disc fractions and also allows us to reproduce kinematic observations with gas expulsion timescale
τgas = 2.5 Myr. In future, observations of PPD populations
in regions with a strong FUV flux but with more modest velocity dispersions (and primordial gas density) might offer
further constraints for α.

PPDs can rapidly grow to size scales where it is immune to
photoevaporative stripping (e.g. Youdin & Goodman 2005),
planet formation may be completely supressed for such host
stars (Haworth et al. 2018a).

Figure 16. A subset of 20 discs of those shown in figure 15a
(after 3 Myr of evolution), chosen to be approximately uniformly
distributed over a range of stellar masses 0.5 − 2 M . All discs
are also selected such that they are in an environment where
the projected flux has an instaneous value 3000 G0 < FFUV <
8000 G0 . Discs with Mdisc < 10−3 M are considered upper limits
(non-detections). The red lines are a subset of samples from the
posterior distribution obtained from Markov chain Monte Carlo
modelling (using the Linmix package - Kelly 2007). The black line
is is a model with β = 1.9 selected from the posterior distribution
such that the true β is greater than this value with 2σ confidence.

Finally we make predictions for future observations of
the disc mass and radius distribution in Cyg OB2. We find
that samples of PPDs in highly FUV irradiated environment have significantly reduced masses and outer radii than
in regions of more modest flux. However, taking into account
sensitivity limits, statistically observing these differences requires sample sizes of & 100s of discs in both high and low
FUV flux bins. This is similarly true for disc outer radii, and
makes probing the difference between disc property distributions as a function of FUV environment directly impractical
at present.
In Cygnus OB2 we expect a strong correlation between
stellar mass and disc mass (Mdisc ∝ mβstar , with β > 2)
which is a consequence of the fact that, for a disc with given
radius and in a given FUV environment, the mass loss rate is
higher in the shallower potential of low mass stars. This effect should be clear in a sufficiently large sample of irradiated
discs in any environment. In Cygnus OB2, we demonstrate
that - taking into account the finite sensitivity of ALMA - it
would be sufficient to target around 20 stars of known mass
in order to demonstrate a value of β that is steeper than
the canonical value ∼ 1 – 1.9 which is seen in non-irradiated
disc samples. We conclude that, pending empirical confirmation, discs around low mass stars born in environments
of strong FUV flux are likely to have a significantly depleted
mass budget for planet formation. Indeed, unless dust within

Figure 17. As in figure 15 but for disc outer radius distributions. In figure 17a initial disc masses are drawn from a distribution which
scales linearly with stellar host mass, while in figure 17b the initial PPD mass is not correlated to host mass. Points are coloured by the
largest scale fractal membership. We find that the outer radii are largely independent of disc initial conditions and are correlated with
stellar host mass.
