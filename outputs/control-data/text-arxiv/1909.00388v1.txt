Modelling the climate and weather of a 2D Lagrangian-averaged
Euler-Boussinesq equation with transport noise
Diego Alonso-Orán, Aythami Bethencourt de León, Darryl Holm, and So Takao
A BSTRACT. The prediction of climate change and its impact on extreme weather events is one of the great
societal and intellectual challenges of our time. The first part of the problem is to make the distinction between
weather and climate. The second part is to understand the dynamics of the fluctuations of the physical variables.
The third part is to predict how the variances of the fluctuations are affected by statistical correlations in their
fluctuating dynamics. This paper investigates a framework called LA SALT which can meet all three parts of the
challenge for the problem of climate change. As a tractable example of this framework, we consider the Euler–
Boussinesq (EB) equations for an incompressible stratified fluid flowing under gravity in a vertical plane with
no other external forcing. All three parts of the problem are solved for this case. In fact, for this problem, the
framework also delivers global well-posedness of the dynamics of the physical variables and closed dynamical
equations for the moments of their fluctuations. Thus, in a well-posed mathematical setting, the framework
developed in this paper shows that the mean field dynamics combines with an intricate array of correlations
in the fluctuation dynamics to drive the evolution of the mean statistics. The results of the framework for 2D
EB model analysis define its climate, as well as climate change, weather dynamics, and change of weather
statistics, all in the context of a model system of SPDEs with unique global strong solutions.

1. Introduction
Background. To meet the challenge of climate change prediction in practice, one must predict the
coarse-grained dynamic changes of an extremely complex atmosphere/ocean system which is only partially
observed by using a suite of imperfect theoretical and computational simulation models. This means that
predictions of quantities of climate interest may be strongly affected by uncertainty arising from unknown
model errors and incomplete knowledge of state variables. In addition, one must assess the impacts of
climate change over a wide range of significant temporal and spatial scales. For example, one must predict
and understand the seasonal, yearly, decadal, and centennial impacts of climate change for issues ranging
from extreme weather events, to sea level rise, and the dynamic distributions of deserts and forests.
Previous approaches. Deterministic physics characterises the climate change problem as a high-dimensional
complex dynamical system with sensitivity to initial conditions on essentially all spatial and temporal scales.
To estimate the level of difficulty of the climate change problem, one notes that the turbulence problem falls
into this same class of problems. The governing Navier-Stokes equations are known for turbulence, though.

The central difficulty of climate change science is that the dynamical equations for the actual climate are
unknown. In fact, even the definition of climate is still under discussion in the literature [Bot18].
As in turbulence theory, the statistical approach to the climate system has been developed in parallel to
the deterministic computational approach. This development goes back at least fifty years to the early predictability studies for simplified atmosphere models [Eps69, Lor63, Lor65, Lor69, Lor76, Lor95, Lor96].
In a celebrated unpublished paper [Lor95] Ed Lorenz defined the statistical approach to climate science by
quoting the following adage.
“Climate is what you expect. Weather is what you get.”
This adage captures the essence of the problem. Namely, climate science is fundamentally probabilistic.
In the same unpublished paper [Lor95] Lorenz remarked that:
There are many questions regarding climate whose answers remain elusive. For example, there is the question of determinism; was it somehow inevitable at some earlier
time that the climate now would be as it actually is?
To address some of his questions in [Lor95] and particularly to address climate change without giving up
determinism, Lorenz postulated the idea of an “almost intransitive” dynamical system, as follows.
An almost intransitive system is one that can undergo two or more distinct types of
behaviour, and will exhibit one type for a long time, but not forever.
Since then, many people have discussed this issue, especially as it has become increasingly urgent. A recent
review appears, e.g., in [DS13]. Lorenz seemed to suggest in [Lor95] that the expected solution itself could
be almost intransitive. Answering this question would require a deterministic equation for the expected
solution.
Lorenz’s concept of “almost intransitivity” also recalls the concept of intermittency discussed in turbulence
modelling using the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations, although intermittency is usually regarded at the shorter
time scales available for typical turbulence problems.
Computational simulation of Navier–Stokes turbulence faces a closure problem, because it is unable to
encompass all of the spatial and temporal scales which develop in the turbulent cascade of energy. Climate
science faces an even more extensive closure problem, if it makes the assumption that the weather and the
climate obey the same equations. The question then arises, “Would turbulence modelling approaches apply
to the climate, if the climate were defined as simply ‘what you expect’ as a statistical property of a dynamical
system?”
This turbulence question engages another recently developing computational approach in climate/weather
numerical simulations. This approach involves the introduction of stochastic parameterisation, in which
mean quantities of interest do have a precise sense of ‘expectation’ and the remainder at a given instant has
a sense of ‘fluctuation’. For recent reviews of this approach, see, e.g. [BJP12, BAB+ 17, GCF16]. In the
approach to stochastic parameterisation, the summary conclusion of [BJP12] is that
a posteriori addition of stochasticity to an already tuned model is simply not viable.
This in turn suggests that stochasticity must be incorporated at a very basic level within
the design of physical process parameterisations and improvements to the dynamical
core.
One approach in line with this conclusion is the SALT (stochastic advection by Lie transport) approach introduced in [Hol15]. The SALT approach combines stochasticity at the ‘basic level’ of Kelvin’s circulation
theorem, along with the particle filtering method used for data assimilation. A protocol for applying the
SALT approach in data assimilation based on comparing fine scale and coarse scale computational simulations has recently been developed in [CCH+ 19, CCH+ 18]. The rest of the present paper will concentrate
on developing a Lagrangian-averaged (LA) version of SALT which was recently proposed in [DH19] and
developed further in [DHL19] for potential use in climate change science.

Aims of the present paper. In this paper, we derive a stochastic version of the two-dimensional EulerBoussinesq fluid system which is non-local in probability space, rather than in physical space, in the sense
that the expected velocity is assumed to replace the drift velocity in the transport operator for the stochastic
fluid flow. This stochastic fluid model is derived by exploiting a novel idea introduced in [DH19], of applying Lagrangian-averaging (LA) in probability space to the fluid equations governed by stochastic advection
by Lie transport (SALT) which were introduced in [Hol15].
We follow the LA SALT approach to achieve three results of interest in climate modelling based on the
Kelvin circulation theorem for stochastic transport of the Kelvin loop. The three results address the three
components of the climate change problem discussed at the outset. First, it answers Lorenz’s question about
determinism in the affirmative. Namely, by replacing the drift velocity of the stochastic vector field by its
expected value, one finds that the expected fluid motion becomes deterministic. This first step leads to the
second result of interest in climate change modelling. Namely, it reduces the dynamical equations for the
fluctuations to a linear stochastic transport problem with a deterministic drift velocity. Such problems are
well-posed. We prove here that the LA SALT version of the 2D EB problem in a vertical plane possesses
global strong solutions. The third result addresses the dynamics of the variances of the fluctuations. This
result demonstrates that the variances and higher moments of the fluctuation statistic evolve deterministically, driven by a certain set of correlations of the fluctuations among themselves. Thus, the first result of the
paper makes the distinction between climate and weather for the case at hand. Namely, the LA SALT fluid
equations for 2D EB may be regarded as a dissipative system akin to the Navier–Stokes equations for the expected motion (climate) which is embedded into a larger conservative system which includes the statistics of
the fluctuation dynamics (weather). The second result provides a set of linear stochastic transport equations
for predicting the fluctuations (weather) of the physical variables, as they are driven by the deterministic
expected motion. The third result produces closed deterministic evolutionary equations for the evolution of
the variances and covariances of the stochastic fluctuations and their p-th order central moments in certain
cases.
In summary, the 2D EB model system treated here by the LA SALT approach reveals that its statistical
properties are fundamentally dynamical. The results of the 2D EB LA SALT model analysis define climate,
as well as climate change, weather, and change of weather statistics, all in the context of a model system of
SPDEs with unique global strong solutions.
Plan of the paper.
Section 2 introduces the 2D EB LA SALT system and computes the dynamics of the expectation and fluctuation components of its solutions, as well as their variances.
Section 3 computes expectation and fluctuation dynamics for LA SALT equations, as well as their variances,
covariances and p-th central moments, in a general setting. In general, the dynamics of these statistics for
LA SALT does not close. However, the fluctuation statistics for the 2D EB LA SALT system in fact does
close and the properties resulting from this closure are discussed in Example 3.7.
Section 4 describes the analytical setting and explains the approach in obtaining the main result Theorem
4.4 of well-posedness of the 2D EB LA SALT system, as proved in Section 5, subsection 5.2. Namely,
for sufficiently smooth initial conditions (u0 , θ0 ) ∈ H 2 (T2 , R2 ) × H 3 (T2 , R), there exists a unique global
strong solution of the 2D LA-SALT EB equations (2.12).

2. The Euler-Boussinesq (EB) fluid system in a vertical plane
In concert with the idea that the climate should be computed with the same fundamental equations as the
weather, this paper addresses a representative model of stratified incompressible flow which is a component
of any climate model. Namely, it addresses the familiar Euler-Boussinesq (EB) fluid system in a vertical
plane. The issue of global existence of regular solutions of the deterministic Boussinesq model still remains
an outstanding open problem. Its SALT version inherits most of the properties of its deterministic counterpart and its local well-posedness has been recently established in [AOdL19]. We first recall the introduction
into 2D EB of stochastic advection by Lie transport (SALT) as discussed in that work. We then apply the Lagrangian averaging (LA) concept in probability space to derive and analyse the LA SALT version of the 2D
EB equations. We establish global well-posedness of the LA SALT EB system and investigate the solution
behaviour of this stochastic PDE system.
We begin with the following question. What is the Kelvin circulation theorem for the 2D EB climate/weather
system?
2.1. What is the Kelvin circulation theorem for the 2D EB climate/weather system? The Kelvin
circulation theorem is a statement of Newton’s Force Law for the motion of distributions of mass on closed
material loops c(uL
t ), where the subscript t denotes explicit time dependence. By definition, such material
loops move with the transport velocity uL
t of the fluid flow. Newton’s Force Law states that the time rate of
change of the momentum P of such a loop of a given mass distribution is equal to the force F applied to it.
For the fluid situation, this is written as
I
I
d
dP
f (x) · dx =: F .
(2.1)
ut (x) · dx =
:=
dt
dt c(uLt )
)
c(uL
t
The Kelvin-Newton relation in (2.1) for loop momentum dynamics apparently involves two kinds of velocity.
The first velocity is uL
t , which is the velocity of the material masses distributed in the line elements along
the moving loop. Since it refers to the fluid parcel transport, the velocity uL
t is a Lagrangian quantity. A
second quantity with dimensions of velocity (ut ) appears in the integrand of the Kelvin circulation. This
quantity is physically the momentum per unit mass, defined in the fixed inertial frame which is required for
Newton’s force law (2.1) to be valid. This means that ut is an Eulerian quantity, defined in the fixed frame
through which the Lagrangian parcels move at velocity uL
t . Mathematically, the momentum per unit mass
(ut ) is the product of the inverse of the mass density (which itself is a subset of the advected quantities,
D ⊂ a) times the variational derivative at fixed spatial coordinate of the Lagrangian ℓ(uL
t , a) in Hamilton’s
principle with respect to the velocity, uL
t . In Euler–Poincaré form, this is the Kelvin–Noether theorem of
[HMR98]. Namely,
I

:=
⋄ a · dx =: F ,
(2.2)
· dx =
L
dt
dt c(uLt ) D δut
D δa
c(uL
t )
where the diamond operation (⋄) is defined in [HMR98] and is discussed further in the present context
below.
Note, in the discussion below, when the Lagrangian velocity happens to be equal to the momentum per unit
mass, then uL
t → ut and we shall drop the superscript L, although the distinction in their definitions still
remains. This slight abuse of notation should cause no confusion, because the transport velocity is a vector
field which acts on the momentum per unit mass which, in turn, is the 1-form appearing in the integrand of
the Kelvin circulation integral.
The modelling approach of Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport (SALT) modifies the Kelvin theorem in
(2.1) for deterministic fluids by replacing the transport velocity of the loop uL
t in the deterministic Kelvin
theorem by a Stratonovich stochastic vector field dxt whose drift velocity is the same as the Eulerian velocity

The vector fields ξ k are to be determined from data analysis as in [CCH+ 18, CCH+ 19]. This paper will
work formally, by simply assuming that these vector fields are already known from appropriate data analysis
for a given application.
R EMARK 2.1 (Notation temporal (d) vs spatial (d)). In the literature, the letter d is typically used to denote
either (1) stochastic time evolution, or (2) exterior derivative/spacial differential. To avoid confusion, here
we will use the roman font “ d” to denote the former and the sans serif “d” to denote the latter.
The same stochastic transport velocity dxt advects the Lagrangian parcels, which may carry advected quantities (a), such as heat, mass and magnetic field lines, by Lie transport along with the flow, as [HMR98]
da + Ldxt a = 0 .

(2.5)

In this paper, we apply the LA SALT (Lagrangian-averaged SALT) approach proposed in [DH19] and
developed in [DHL19]. The LA SALT approach modifies the SALT Kelvin circulation in (2.3) by replacing
the drift velocity in the stochastic transport loop velocity in (2.4) by its expectation, plus the same noise as
in SALT. Namely, cf. equation (2.4),

Since the expectation in (2.7) refers to the transport velocity uL
t of Lagrangian loop in Kelvin’s theorem, we
refer to this process as probabilistic Lagrangian Average (denoted as LA), reminiscent of the time average
at fixed Lagrangian coordinate in the LANS-alpha turbulence model,[CFH+ 98, CFH+ 99a, CFH+ 99b,
FHT01, FHT02]. For example, in the Euler fluid case the modified Kelvin theorem reads,

 dut · dx + LdXt ut = 0 ,
 ut · dx =

c dXt

where LdXt ut denotes the Lie derivative of the one-form ut = ut · dx with respect to the vector field dXt
given in equation (2.7). The LA SALT motion equation leading to the modified Kelvin theorem in (2.8) was
previously stated along with additional noisy and viscous terms in Lemma 3 of [DH19].
In fact, an alternative approach leading to the appearance of the vector field (2.7) in a stochastic modification
of the SALT Kelvin circulation theorem as in equation (2.6) and leading to equation (2.8) has also been
proposed independently in [Hoc18]. In [Hoc18], this modification was proposed as an analogue for SPDE
of the McKean-Vlasov mean field approach for finite dimensional SDE describing Hamiltonian interacting
particle systems when the Hamiltonian is independent of the position variables [HM66]. The modification
as in equation (2.6) was applied in [Hoc18] to derive the Navier-Stokes equations by taking the expectation
of the resulting equations.
The present work will take the work in [DH19] and [Hoc18] farther, by following the LA SALT (Lagrangian
Averaged SALT) approach along the same lines as [DHL19] in applying expectations of the variations with
respect to advected variables in combination with the known semidirect-product structure of the Lie–Poisson

6

Hamiltonian formulation of ideal fluid dynamics. The semidirect-product structure of ideal fluid dynamics
is reviewed for example [MR13, HS09].
To express the LA SALT equations discussed in [DHL19], one may act with the semidirect-product (SDP)
Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian matrix operator on the expected values of the variational derivatives of the Hamiltonian. In the absence of advected fluid quantities, the corresponding expected-quantity equations produce
a Lie-Laplacian version of the Navier-Stokes equation, which reduces to the Navier–Stokes equation in a
special choice of the functions ξ (k) = {(1, 0, 0)T , (0, 1, 0)T , (0, 0, 1)T } for k = 1, 2, 3, as discussed in
[Hoc18]. After writing the expectation equations with advected quantities in the SDP Hamiltonian matrix
form, one observes that the fluctuation equations comprise a linear transport system which is slaved to the
expectation equations whose solutions are deterministic and can be obtained for all time for a certain class
of Hamiltonians. This slaving relation enables one to calculate the evolution equations for the local and
spatially integrated variances of the fluctuations. This entire process will be pursued in this paper specifically for the LA SALT modification of the two-dimensional Euler–Boussinesq equations for a stratified
incompressible fluid in a vertical plane.

2.2. The LA SALT 2D Euler–Boussinesq equations. The deterministic Euler–Boussinesq (EB) equations for an incompressible, inviscid 2D fluid flow in a vertical plane under gravity are given by

y,
(x, t) ∈ T2 × R+ ,
 ∂t u + (u · ∇) u = −∇p + gθb
∂t θ + u · ∇θ = 0,
(2.9)

∇ · u = 0,

where u = (u1 , u2 ) is the incompressible vector velocity field, p is the scalar pressure, g is the acceleration
b is
due to gravity, θ corresponds to the temperature, or buoyancy, which is transported by the fluid, and y
the unitary vector field in the vertical direction. The EB equations (2.9) are fundamental in meteorology.
Among other aspects, these equations are used to model the process of front formation. They are considered
a fundamental model for the study of large scale atmospheric and oceanic flows, built environment, and
dispersion of dense gases [Ped87, Ric07]. From a mathematical point of view, the 2D EB equations retain
some key features of the well-known Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, as for instance, a vortex stretching
b 6= 0. The problem has attracted considerable attention in the PDE community, and
mechanism for ∇θ × y
local existence results and regularity criteria, as well as numerical experiments, are available, [CD80, HL05,
Cha06, EJ18]. The fundamental issue of whether classical solutions of the 2D incompressible Boussinesq
equations can develop finite time singularities remains an outstanding open problem which seems to be
out of reach, [Yud03]. In this paper, we will be dealing with the following LA SALT modification of the
deterministic EB system in (2.9) as a suitable model for predicting EB ‘climate’ dynamics in the sense of
Lorenz [Lor95].

Lu f = u · ∇f.

Lu v = (u · ∇v − v · ∇u) · ∇ = [u, v] = −adu v.

• (Densities) Given a density D = ρdxn ∈ Ωn (Rn ), we have

• (One-form densities) Given a one-form density µ = α ⊗ ρ dxn , where α ∈ Ω1 (Rn ) and ρ dxn ∈
Ωn (Rn ), its Lie derivative is given by
Lu (α ⊗ ρ dxn ) = (ρ Lu α + div(ρu)α) ⊗ dxn .

It is well-known that for one-form densities (which are dual under L2 pairing to the Lie algebra
of vector fields), the coadjoint representation of the Lie algebra is equivalent to the Lie derivative,
i.e., ad∗u (α ⊗ ρ dxn ) ≡ Lu (α ⊗ ρ dxn ), a fact we will use throughout this paper.
We refer the readers to [HMR98] for further examples of Lie derivatives arising in continuum dynamics and
the corresponding expressions for the diamond operator. We also remark that all the previous definitions
take the same form on the torus T2 .

with (µ, θ, D) denoting momentum one-form density, potential temperature, and density respectively, where
µ(x, t) := u · dx ⊗ ρ dx2 , D := ρ dx2 , and the advected potential temperature θ = θ(x, t) is understood as

We note that the well-posedness of this equation and a blow-up criterion for it were derived in [AOdL19].
In this paper, by considering the Lagrangian-averaged version of (3.15), we construct the LA SALT 2D EB
model, which will turn out to be globally well-posed.
3.3. Lagrangian-averaged (LA) SALT equations. Recently a modification of the SALT has been
made in [DH19] and analysed in [DHL19] for 3D stochastic fluid motion. This modification preserves
the Lie–Poisson bracket structure of the SALT equations, while replacing the variational derivatives of the
Hamiltonian by their expected values, denoted E[ · ], as follows. First, the Lagrangian trajectory equation
(3.11) is modified by taking the expectation of the drift velocity, as

These equations describe Lagrangian-averaged stochastic advection by Lie transport (LA SALT). That is,
the Lagrangian path dXt in equation (3.16) has been acquired by taking the expectation (averaging in probability space) of the drift velocity of the SALT Lagrangian path (3.11) at fixed Lagrangian label. The SALT
equations in advective form (3.12) now become the LA SALT equations, given by

with dXt defined in equation (3.16). If there are several advected quantities, one sums over all of them in
the diamond term in (3.18). Notice that the LA SALT equations in (3.17) have the same Poisson matrix
operator as for the SALT equations in (3.10) and therefore many key features of the Lie-Poisson system are
preserved, such as the conservation of Casimirs and Kelvin’s circulation theorem (see Remark 3.4 below).
Thus, between equations (3.10) and (3.17), only the variational derivatives of the deterministic parts of the
Hamiltonian have been changed to accommodate the differences between Lagrangian trajectories for SALT
and LA SALT in equations (3.11) and (3.16).

R EMARK 3.3 (Comparing SALT and LA SALT). The LA SALT approach applies to the same physical class
of equations as for SALT. Following the deterministic route set in [HMR98], the class of SALT fluid equations was first derived in [Hol15] from the symmetry-reduced Lagrangians ℓ(u, a) for the Euler–Poincaré
Hamilton’s principle with µ = δℓ/δu, whose variations were constrained to respect stochastic advection
laws in (3.12). The LA SALT approach modifies the stochastic process dxt for the transport vector field
in (3.11) which defines the stochastic Lagrangian trajectory in SALT to become dXt as in (3.16). The
Euler–Poincaré version of the Lie–Poisson expression of the motion equation in (3.18) is,
h δℓ i
δℓ
δℓ
(3.19)
d + LdXt

The comparisons between them can be derived from the relations δℓ/δu = µ and δℓ/δa = −δh/δa which
are obtained from the deterministic Legendre transform from the reduced Lagrangian to the reduced Hamiltonian,
dh(µ, a) = µ , u − ℓ(u, a) ,

(3.20)

and the assumption that the reduced Lagrangian is hyperregular, which almost always holds in continuum
mechanics.

R EMARK 3.4 (The Kelvin circulation theorem for LA SALT). In fluid dynamics, the mass density Dd3 x is
always an advected quantity, satisfying the continuity equation, which in this case is expressed as,

(3.21)
d(Dd3 x) + LdXt (Dd3 x) = dD + div(dXt D) d3 x = 0 .

Consequently, if we define the circulation one-form v = v · dx by

µ = m · dx ⊗ d3 x = v · dx ⊗ Dd3 x = v ⊗ Dd3 x ,

(3.22)

and use the continuity equation (3.21), and then the advective form of the motion equation in (3.18), we can
write the Kelvin circulation theorem for LA SALT as

This relation may be proved, for example, by following the corresponding proof of the stochastic Kelvin
calculation for SALT in [dLHLT19]. Thus, because the LA SALT modification in (3.16) of the SALT
transport vector field in (3.11) preserves the Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian structure of SALT, one also acquires
the Kelvin circulation theorem for LA SALT in (3.23). Note that for compressible fluids, the right-hand side

of the relation in (3.23) can be nonlinear in the stochastic variables.

The Itô LA SALT dynamics turns out to be quite different from that of Itô SALT dynamics. Indeed, fundamental and significant simplifications occur in the structure of the equations when the drift velocity of SALT
is replaced by its expectation in LA SALT. First, when the expectations of the two LA SALT equations in
advective form (3.18) are written out by taking the expectation on both sides of (3.25), noting that the Itô
integral vanishes due to the martingale property,

one realises that these equations provide the entire history of the solutions for the expectations E [µ] and
E [a] throughout the domain of flow. Once the expectation equations (3.26) have been solved, the equations
for the instantaneous stochastic variables (3.25) become linear Itô stochastic transport equations, which are
driven by the solutions of equations (3.26), whose entire history is obtained separately. We note that the
coupled system (3.25)+(3.26) is closed provided that the variables (µ, a) and its corresponding variational
derivatives are related linearly, i.e., there exists a linear operator Λ : X(M )sV → X∗ (M )sV ∗ such that
(δH/δµ, δH/δa) = Λ∗ (µ, a). For example, Λ is a convolution with respect to some kernel.

R EMARK 3.5 (Non-parabolicity
P of the Itô equation). We note that the presence of the second order differential operator µ → − 12 k Lξk Lξk µ in the Itô formulation (3.25) does not introduce parabolicity into
P
b,
the equation even though − 12 k Lξk Lξk µ reduces to the standard Laplace operator −∆µ when ξ (1) = x
b . This feature of Itô calculus may be understood and demonstrated as follows. First, the Itô and
ξ (2) = y
Stratonovich formulations ((3.25) and (3.18), respectively) are equivalent, and the latter is a pure transport
equation. Second, an additional term appears in the process of making energy estimates in the Itô formulation. This is known as the Itô correction term, and it cancels the a priori dissipative effect of the double Lie
derivative. Consequently, although one may expect to show that the initial smoothness of the equations will
be preserved, no additional smoothing mechanism is available from the second-order Itô correction term.
3.5. Evolution of the covariance tensor. We have seen that the expectation of the variables in the LA
SALT equation form a closed system. Could we say the same about the covariance? For general semi-direct
product LA-SALT systems (3.18), the answer is no. However, the covariance for the advected quantities
does always form a closed system as we will show below.

By the Leibniz property of Lie derivatives, we have

Lξk Lξk u′ ⊗ dθ ′ = Lξk u′ ⊗ Lξk (dθ ′ ) + Lξk (ω ′ ) ⊗ dθ ′

= u′ ⊗ L2ξk (dθ ′ ) + 2(Lξk u′ ) ⊗ Lξk (dθ ′ ) + L2ξk ω ′ ⊗ dθ ′ .

Now using the above expression and taking expectations on both sides of (3.35) give us the PDE:

Similarly, we get an equation for E [dθ ′ ⊗ u′ ] and combining them gives us an equation for E [u′ ⊗ dθ ′ + dθ ′ ⊗ u′ ],
which reads

Since the last term E (dθ ′ )2 is just the covariance tensor dΘ(2) , which we can solve for, we conclude that
equations (3.32),(3.34) and (3.36) form together a closed system for the covariance of the fields (u, θ) in the
2D LA-SALT Boussinesq system.
R EMARK 3.8. By having a closed system of PDEs for the evolution of the covariance, we may deduce
for instance its growth behaviour through the application of standard PDE methods. For instance if we
consider the equation for the evolution of Θ(2) (3.18), where we assume incompressibility div(E [u]) = 0,
b , ξ (2) = y
b , then we can check directly that its L2 -norm satisfies

where C > 0 is some constant (see Section 5.1 below for more details), we can deduce that the spaceaveraged covariance kΘ(2) k2L2 evolves at most exponentially fast.
R EMARK 3.9 (Extension to p-th central moments). One may also ask if closed equations for the higher
moments of the advected tensor field a can be derived, thus providing a generalisation of Proposition 3.6,
which may help us to understand for instance the non-Gaussianity of the system. In the case where a is a
scalar field, the p-th central moment A(p) := E [(a − E [a])p ] indeed satisfies a closed, iterated system:

which recovers (3.28) in the case p = 2 (see Appendix B for the proof). However, when a is a general
tensor field, we have not been able to obtain a closed system for its p-th central moment due to the noncommutativity of the tensor product (which is commutative only in the scalar field case).

4. Preliminaries and notation for the analysis in Section 5
4.1. Function spaces, inequalities and embeddings. We define the L2 -inner product as hf, giL2 :=
2
T2 f (x) · g(x) dV , where dV is the Lebesgue measure on T and denote by k · kL2 its corresponding norm.
For any k ∈ N, we denote the Sobolev space by H k , equipped with the norm
X
||f ||2H k :=
kD j f k2L2 ,

R

j≤k

where D represents weak derivative. RWe define the space Ḣ k to be the subspace of H k consisting of
functions that integrate to zero, that is, T2 f (x) dV = 0. For any p ∈ Z, we denote by Lp (T2 ; R2 ) the class
of all measurable p - integrable functions defined on the two-dimensional torus, with values in R2 . This
1/p
Z
. Conventionally, for p = ∞ we
|f |p dV
space is endowed with its canonical norm kf kLp :=
T2

denote by L∞ the space of essentially bounded measurable functions. Next, if X is a general Banach space
we let C([0, ∞); X) be the space of continuous functions from [0, ∞) to X equipped with the uniform
convergence norm over compact subintervals of [0, ∞) and Lp ([0, T ]; X) the space of measurable functions
from [0, ∞) to X such that the norm

is finite.
Biot-Savart operator. For any f : T2 → R2 , we define the curl operator
curl f = ∇⊥ · f = ∂2 f 2 − ∂1 f 1 ,
where ∂i denotes the derivative
defined by

∂
.
∂xi

The inverse of the curl operator (known as the Biot-Savart operator) is
Kf := ∇⊥ (−∆)−1 f

acting on mean-free functions f : T2 → R. In fluid dynamics, the Biot-Savart operator allows us to
reconstruct the mean-free component of the velocity vector field u from the vorticity function ω, satisfying
curl u = ω. Moreover, we have the inequality
kukH k+1 ≤ Ck kωkH k ,

(4.1)

for all k ≥ 0, where Ck > 0 represents a positive constant depending only on k, cf. [Sch96].
Inequalities and embeddings. In our well-posedness analysis below, we will be using different forms of
Sobolev embeddings, namely, the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequalities. For the sake of clarity, we
list below the ones we will make use of most often. For every smooth function f : T2 → R with zero-mean,
it holds

4.2. Some results from stochastic analysis. We recall some results from the theory of stochastic processes that will be employed in our proofs later. We refer the reader to the standard references [DPZ72,
Fla96] for a more thorough review. We begin by fixing a stochastic basis S = (Ξ, F, {Ft }t≥0 , P, {W i }N
i=1 ),
i
N
that is, a filtered probability space (Ξ, F, P) together with a family {W }i=1 of i.i.d. Brownian motions that
is adapted to the filtration {Ft }t≥0 .
In our existence proof for the linear stochastic equations, we will use the following version of Itô’s lemma:
L EMMA 4.1 (Itô’s first formula, [Kun97]). Let φt be the flow of the following forward Stratonovich SDE

[dLHLT19], Theorem 3.1.

for some λ > 0 and every η ∈ R2 . This generalises a fundamental property of the Laplace operator ∆,
which can be recovered by choosing ξ k = ek , k = 1, 2, where {e1 , e2 } is the canonical basis for R2 .
From an analysis perspective, we opt to work with Lie derivatives instead of general first order differential
operators since the curl commutes with the Lie derivative (a consequence of Cartan’s formula), allowing us
to obtain the vorticity formulation of the stochastic Boussinesq system, making the analysis simpler.

4.4. Statements of the main analytical results. Let us state here the notion of solution we will employ
and the main theorems that we are going to prove in the following sections. For this, we need to understand
the strategy we are going to follow in order to solve the 2D LA SALT Boussinesq equations (2.12). Indeed,
to construct a solution, we carry out the following steps:
• We start by solving for the variables E[u] and E[θ] in the equations for the expectation (2.13).
Since E[u] is incompressible, it is sufficient to project the momentum equation onto its vorticity
formulation by applying the curl operator, solve for the new system, and then recover E[u] by
means of the Biot-Savart law. The pressure terms E[p − |u|2 /2] can be recovered by solving a
Poisson problem for the pressure terms. This argument is detailed in Section 5
• We plug the already solved deterministic variables E[u], E[θ], and E[p − |u|2 /2] into the main
equations (2.12). We note that these become stochastic linear equations with a forcing. Now we
need to solve for u. To this aim, we provide the required estimates on the linear equation. Once
u is solved, we can recover the expected pressure as E[p] = E[p − |u|2 /2] + E[|u|2 /2]. We will
denote f (t, x) = −dE[p − |u|2 /2 − gθy] + gE [θ] yb since this appears as a forcing after solving
the pressure term in the expected equations.

D EFINITION 4.3 (Strong solution of the 2D LA-SALT-Boussinesq equations). We say that a process (u, θ) ∈
L2 Ω; C(R+ , H 2 (T2 , R2 ) × H 3 (T2 , R)) is a strong global solution to the 2D LA-SALT-Boussinesq equation (2.12) if (ut , θt ) is adapted to the filtration {Ft }t≥0 and satisfies

almost surely for all t > 0, where, as specified in the preliminaries, the notation L is used to represent both
the Lie derivative applied to one-forms u and to scalars θ.
T HEOREM 4.4. Let (u0 , θ0 ) ∈ H 2 (T2 , R2 ) × H 3 (T2 , R), then there exists a unique global strong solution
of the 2D LA-SALT Boussinesq equation (2.12).

The proof of Theorem 4.4 strongly depends on the following fact, which we state as a separate result:
T HEOREM 4.5. Let (E[u0 ], E[θ0 ]) ∈ H 5 (T2 , R2 ) × H 3 (T2 , R) be an initial data. Thenequations (2.15)
have a unique global strong solution (E[u], E[θ]) ∈ C [0, ∞), H 5 (T2 , R2 ) × H 3 (T2 , R) .

R EMARK 4.6. We note that even though we start the stochastic equation with u0 ∈ H 2 (T2 , R2 ), we require
an additional assumption that E [u0 ] ∈ H 5 (T2 , R2 ) in order to prove Theorem 4.4. This is possible since the
expectation of a random field may be smoother than the random field (for example take u0 (x) = x + Wx ,
where Wx is spacial Brownian motion. Then u0 is not even differentiable, yet E [u0 (x)] = x is smooth.)
For deterministic initial conditions, this means that we start with u0 ∈ H 5 (T2 , R2 ) but it loses regularity
to H 2 (T2 , R2 ) as soon as t > 0 and will remain there. We may also construct weak solutions instead of
classical solutions by employing the techniques in [dLT19], thus avoiding this assumption altogether.
R EMARK 4.7. The regularity of the initial datum in Theorem 4.5 is not sharp. It is well-known that even
for L2 regular initial data we could still provide the instantaneous regularisation of the solutions. We have

MODELLING CLIMATE AND WEATHER OF 2D LA-SALT EULER-BOUSSINESQ

19

chosen precisely H 5 × H 3 since our final goal is to prove Theorem 4.4 which requires higher regularity.
This is due to the need of having a sufficiently smooth coefficient for the characteristic equations in order
get a smooth flow (cf. Subsection 5.2). It is easy to check that equations (2.12) lose their parabolic character
and become pure transport equations.
5. Global well-posedness of the 2D LA-SALT Boussinesq system
5.1. Well-posedness of the expectation equations. In this section we will provide the proof of Theorem (4.5). The strategy of the proof will be divided into three parts: first, we will use energy methods to
provide a priori estimates of the solution. Next, we will show a bound for the evolution of the average of U .
Finally, we will prove the uniqueness of solutions.
Step 1: Energy methods and a priori estimates. First of all, to simplify the exposition we will employ the
following notations:
E[u] := U , E[θ] := Θ, E[p] := P,
which we decompose as
Z
Z
U dV and Θ =
Θ dV,
U = U + V , Θ = Θ + W, such that U =

Step 2: Mean growth control. Next, let us control the growth of the mean part of U in terms of V , Θ and
the initial mean value U 0 . This estimate is essential in order to provide the uniqueness of solutions, as we
will see later. Integrating (5.3) in time, we get (set g = 1 without loss of generality)

Step 3: Uniqueness of solutions. To show uniqueness of solutions, we will prove that any two different solutions of (5.2) with the same initial data must be equal. As usual, we demonstrate it by deriving an estimate for the evolution of their difference and invoking Grönwall’s inequality. Let Ω1 , Ω2 ,

R EMARK 5.2. To establish the existence of strong solutions it suffices to apply a standard Galerkin approximation. Then we repeat the same a priori estimates and check that they are also satisfied by the approximated
equations and independent of the truncation step. Then, by using Aubin–Lions compactness argument, we
can pass to the limit and show that there exists a subsequence that converges to the desired strong solution.
We do not provide the details here as this is standard in the PDE literature.
R EMARK 5.3. Moreover, due to the parabolic character of equations (5.2) (cf. [Tem01])
 we can bootstrap

the regularity and show that for any t0 > 0, we have that (Ω, Θ) ∈ C
[t0 , ∞) × T .

R EMARK 5.4. Notice that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the solutions in terms of (U , Θ)
and (Ω, Ū , Θ). Indeed, since the velocity field U is incompressible, we have that U = ∇⊥ ψ, where ψ is the
stream function. On the other hand, we have that Ω = curl U and hence Ω = −∆ψ. Moreover, an explicit
(non-local) relation between the vorticity and the mean-free part of the velocity field is provided by the
Biot-Savart law V = KΩ. An extra difficulty is that the spatial mean of U is not conserved and therefore,

25

R
we need to solve for the mean part U := T2 U dV separately in order to be able to fully reconstruct the
velocity field U = V + U . Hence, as we have shown above, once we know that the vorticity and the
potential temperature are smooth, plus a good control of the evolution of the mean of the velocity field, we
can recover the full velocity field and infer that it has the same regularity, i.e., smooth.


(4.4). To that purpose, we use the fact that due to Theorem 4.5 , we have that E [u] ∈ C [0, ∞), H 5 (T2 ) .
We divide the proof into two steps: first we show the existence of solutions by explicitly constructing them
using the characteristics of the system. Next, we show the uniqueness of solutions by performing a standard
energy estimate.
Step 1: Existence of solutions via characteristics. Consider the characteristics for the system (4.9),

Invoking Theorem 4.5, we have that E [u] ∈ C [0, ∞), C 3,α (T2 ) due to the Sobolev embedding, with

0 < α′ < 1. Therefore (5.20) admits a unique global solution by Picard’s Theorem and its flow φs,t is C 3,α
regular for every 0 < α < α′ (cf. [Kun97]).

Since the flow φs,t is global, this provides an explicit construction of a global solution to (2.14). Furthermore,
one can verify that (ut , θt ) ∈ H 2 (T2 , R)× H 3 (T2 , R) owing to the C 3,α regularity of the flow φs,t . To show
this, first note that the backward SDE for At (x) := φ−1

inverse map At has C 3,α regularity and the initial data θ0 is in H 3 , we see that its composition is also in
H 3 . For the u-equation, again by applying Itô’s first formula and using the fact that smooth functions are

in a similar fashion that ut ≡ 0 if (u0 , θ0 ) ≡ (0, 0).

Appendix A. Calculation of the Stratonovich-to-Itô correction term in Proposition 3.6
In the proof of Proposition 3.6, we converted the Stratonovich integral (here, we are taking the number of
noise fields to be N = 1 for simplicity)
Z t

(Lξ a) ⊗ a′ + a′ ⊗ (Lξ a) ◦ dWs ,
(A.1)

into an Itô integral. Here, we will show how this is done for readers unfamiliar with stochastic calculus.
Consider a general stochastic process

Then the Stratonovich integral

where, given a partition 0 = t0 < t1 < . . . < tN = 1 with mesh size ∆t := supi∈[0,N ] |ti+1 − ti |), the
cross-variance is defined as the stochastic limit
[X· , W· ]t := lim

where the convergence is in probability. For processes of the form (A.2), one can check that the crossvariation simply reads
Z t
(A.3)
σs ds.
[X· , W· ]t =
0

Now, let us apply this result to our Stratonovich integral (A.1). First we have that
Z t

(Lξ a) ⊗ a′ + a′ ⊗ (Lξ a) ◦ dWs

Z t

2
0

where [(Lξ a) ⊗ a′ , W· ]t + [a′ ⊗ (Lξ a) , W· ]t is the cross-variance between the integrand of the Stratonovich
integral (A.1) with Wt .
Now, taking the Lie derivative Lξ on both sides of equation (3.27), we get
d(Lξ a) + Lξ LE[u] a dt + Lξ (Lξ a) ◦ dWt = 0.

(A.4)

Using (A.4), (3.29) and the stochastic Leibniz rule d(S ⊗ T ) = (◦ dS) ⊗ T + S ⊗ (◦ dT ), we get


d((Lξ a) ⊗ a′ ) = − (Lξ LE[u] a) ⊗ a′ + (Lξ a) ⊗ (LE[u] a′ ) dt − (Lξ Lξ a) ⊗ a′ + (Lξ a) ⊗ (Lξ a) ◦ dWt .

and similarly,



d(a′ ⊗ (Lξ a)) = − (LE[u] a′ ) ⊗ (Lξ a) + a′ ⊗ (Lξ LE[u] a) dt − (Lξ a) ⊗ (Lξ a) + a′ ⊗ (Lξ Lξ a) ◦ dWt .

Therefore, the Stratonovich integral (A.1) in Itô form reads.

Appendix B. p-th central moments for advected scalar fields.
Here, we will show how to derive the p-th central moment equation for scalar fields (3.37) in Remark 3.9.
Consider the stochastic advection equation (3.27) for a scalar field a and let a′ := a − E [a], which satisfies
(3.29). Using Itô’ formula, one can check that
X
d(a′ )p + LE[u] (a′ )p dt +

pX

(p − 1)(a′ )p−2 (Lξk a)2 + (a′ )p−1 Lξk Lξk a′ dt.

Now, by the Leibniz property of the Lie derivative, we have

(a′ )p−1 Lξk Lξk a′ = Lξk Lξk (a′ )p − (p − 1)(a′ )p−2 (Lξk a′ )2
p

p
− (p − 1)(a′ )p−2 (Lξk E [a])2 ,
which we can substitute in the last term of (B.1) to get

Finally, taking expectations on both sides of (B.2) give us an iterative PDE for the p-th central moment of
