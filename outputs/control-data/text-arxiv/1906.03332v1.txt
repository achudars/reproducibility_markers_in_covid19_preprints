ABSTRACT
The solar atmosphere is dominated by loops of magnetic flux which connect the multi-million-degree corona to
the much cooler chromosphere. The temperature and density structure of quasi-static loops is determined by the
continuous flow of energy from the hot corona to the lower solar atmosphere. Loop scaling laws provide relationships
between global properties of the loop (such as peak temperature, pressure, and length); they follow from the physical
variable dependencies of various terms in the energy equation, and hence the form of the loop scaling law provides
insight into the key physics that controls the loop structure. Traditionally, scaling laws have been derived under the
assumption of collision-dominated thermal conduction. Here we examine the impact of different regimes of thermal
conduction – collision-dominated, turbulence-dominated, and free-streaming – on the form of the scaling laws relating
the loop temperature and heating rate to its pressure and half-length. We show that the scaling laws for turbulencedominated conduction are fundamentally different than those for collision-dominated and free-streaming conduction,
inasmuch as the form of the scaling laws now depend primarily on conditions at the low-temperature, rather than
high-temperature, part of the loop. We also establish regimes in temperature and density space in which each of the
applicable scaling laws prevail.

1. INTRODUCTION

In a landmark paper based on Skylab EUV observations, Rosner et al. (1978) showed that the solar corona is not a
plane-parallel structure, but rather is dominated by approximately isobaric loop-like structures with shapes controlled
by the structure of the ambient magnetic field. The plasma confined by the magnetic loops is heated to multi-million
degree temperatures in the corona (by a mechanism that remains largely an open question), while the energy balance
in the cooler lower atmosphere is dominated by radiative losses that dissipate the energy carried downward by thermal
conduction. Hence, in quasi-static equilibrium, the plasma properties of coronal loops are strongly dependent on the
conductive flux, which is usually taken to be proportional to the field-aligned temperature gradient (see Aschwanden
2004; Reale 2014, for reviews).
Rosner et al. (1978) studied the energy balance between heating, radiation, and field-aligned thermal conduction
in quasi-static loops to deduce the now-well-known “scaling laws” relating the maximum temperature TM (K) and
heating rate EH (erg cm−3 s−1 ) in the loop to its half-length L (cm) and pressure p (dyne cm−2 ), viz.
TM ≃ 1.4 × 103 (pL)1/3

(1)

EH ≃ 9.8 × 104 p7/6 L−5/6

(2)

(their Equation (4.3)) and

(their Equation (4.4)). Kano & Tsuneta (1995) found a different coefficient and index for the temperature scaling law
(3.8 × 104 and 1/(5.1 ± 0.5), respectively), based on observational measurements and line-fitting, and they discuss
possible reasons for these discrepancies. The modeling in Rosner et al. (1978) assumed uniform volumetric heating
(a condition later relaxed by Serio et al. 1981; Martens 2010), optically thin radiative losses, and heat conduction
dominated by collisional transport of electrons, in which the heat flux is proportional to the local temperature gradient,
with a coefficient that is temperature-dependent. However, in certain situations (that we discuss in Section 3) the heat
flux can become saturated (and hence a function of only local density and temperature conditions, rather than the
temperature gradient) and reaches its free-streaming limit (Manheimer & Klein 1975; Cowie & McKee 1977; Campbell
1984), or the mean free path used in calculating the thermal conduction coefficient may be limited by some form of
turbulence.
Observations of coronal loop-top hard X-ray sources in solar flares require that the bremsstrahlung-producing electrons are confined to the corona (e.g., Masuda et al. 1994; Doschek et al. 1995; Mariska et al. 1996; Tsuneta et al.
1997; Veronig & Brown 2004; Krucker et al. 2008; Jin & Ding 2008; Guo et al. 2012; Simões & Kontar 2013). Various
authors have considered mechanisms that could be responsible for more effective confinement of accelerated electrons
in the corona, and in particular the possibility that turbulence enhances the angular scattering rate and so suppresses
the rate of escape of non-thermal electrons from the coronal acceleration region (e.g., Kontar et al. 2014; Bian et al.
2017). Of course, the presence of such turbulence will also act to suppress energy transport by thermal electrons. Further, it is likely that some form of small-scale turbulence exists in active region loops, particularly if coronal heating is
due to small-scale processes such as the flux-braiding and reconnection mechanism described by Parker (1988) or the
interaction of counter-propagating Alfvén waves (van Ballegooijen et al. 2011). It is therefore of interest to consider
the effect of small-scale turbulence on the thermal conductive flux and hence on the form of the loop scaling laws. At
the other extreme, if the scattering length (either collisional or turbulent) is large compared to the loop half-length L,
then the heat flux can become saturated.
In this paper we consider how modifications to the collision-dominated physics of thermal conduction, either toward
suppression of conductive flux by turbulence or toward the free-streaming limit, affect the form of the scaling laws
appropriate to active region loops. Our expressions modify those of Rosner et al. (1978) in not only a quantitative but,
as we shall see, qualitative, way, in which conditions in the transition region of the loop can play a role comparable to,
or even more important than, conditions in the hot regions near the coronal apex. We shall also explore the physical
conditions in which each of these regimes dominates the form of the conductive flux and hence the form of the pertinent
scaling law.
We begin in Section 2 with a review of the fundamental energy balance equation in a static coronal loop structure,
and we consider the form of this equation in regimes for which energy transport by thermal conduction takes place
by a combination of collisional, turbulent, or free-streaming processes. Using some plausible assumptions, we derive
approximate analytic solutions to this energy equation and thus deduce the corresponding loop scaling laws for both

3
peak temperature and heating rate in terms of the pressure in, and length of, the loop structure. In Section 3 we
discuss the physical regimes in which each of these scaling laws apply, and in Section 4 we discuss and summarize our
findings.
2. DERIVATION OF THE CORONAL LOOP SCALING LAWS FOR VARIOUS FORMS OF PARALLEL HEAT

CONDUCTION
2.1. Rigorous Scaling Laws
Our starting point is the well-known energy equation for an isobaric coronal loop, which describes the balance
between heat in, radiation out, and energy redistribution by electron-dominated thermal conduction along a guiding
magnetic field line. We delineate the loop using the one-dimensional coordinate s, measured from the loop base toward
the loop apex, i.e., in the direction of positive temperature gradient and in general antiparallel to the direction of the
heat flux. The quasi-static energy balance is thus given by
dF
+ ER = EH ,
ds

(3)

where EH (erg cm−3 s−1 ) is the heat input,
ER = n2 Λ(T ) =

p2
2 T 2 Λ(T )
4kB

(4)

is the (optically thin) radiative loss (erg cm−3 s−1 ) and F (erg cm−2 s−1 ) is the conductive flux (aligned in a direction
antiparallel to the temperature gradient). For thermal transport dominated by Coulomb collisions (denoted below by
the notation [C]), there is the well-known Spitzer (1962) result
FC = −κo T 5/2

dT
.
ds

[C]

(5)

In the above equations, n (cm−3 ) is the density, T (K) is the electron temperature, p = 2nkB T (erg cm−3 ) is the gas
pressure, and
κo =

kB (2kB )5/2
1/2

πme e4 ln Λ

≃ 1.7 × 10−6 erg cm−1 s−1 K−7/2

(6)

is the Spitzer (1962) coefficient of thermal conductivity. Λ(T ) (erg cm3 s−1 ) is the optically-thin radiative loss function
which, in the temperature range of interest (105 K < T < 107 K) is well approximated by the power-law form
Λ(T ) = χ T −1/2 ,

(7)

where χ ≃ 1.6 × 10−19 erg cm3 s−1 K1/2 .
As discussed by Bian et al. (2016), the presence of (for example) a spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations within the
loop gives rise to an additional source of angular scattering for electrons, hereafter referred to as “turbulent scattering,”
with an associated (velocity-independent) mean free path λT (cm). For example, for turbulent scattering associated
with local inhomogeneities δB⊥ in a background magnetic field B0 ,
λT = λB



δB⊥

(8)

where λB is the magnetic correlation length. Although it is possible that the turbulent heat conductivity also depends
2
on quantities such as the magnetic energy release rate (via the fluctuation energy δB⊥
/8π), we here, for simplicity,
take λT to be a constant parameter. When the heat flux is controlled by turbulent scattering, the expression for the
heat flux becomes

When the mean free path (either collisional or turbulent) becomes larger than the characteristic scale of the loop
(e.g., its half-length L), the thermal conductive flux is no longer inhibited by scattering processes and so approaches
its free-streaming value. Since the electrons at a given point now originate from a wide range of positions (and so
temperatures) within the loop, the value of the thermal conductive flux at a given point is in general a non-local
quantity, formed by the convolution of the expression for the local conductive flux as a function of temperature T
with the temperature profile of the loop (Emslie & Bian 2018). Since we are here interested in 0-D global scaling laws,
rather than 1-D variations in quantities with position, we will neglect this non-local factor, which by construction
averages to zero over the loop. An upper limit to the heat flux is therefore set by the free-streaming limit in which
particles move in the direction antiparallel to the local temperature gradient at the local thermal speed (see discussion
in Bradshaw & Cargill 2006):
Fmax = −Eth vth ,

(13)
p
where Eth = (3/2) nkB T is the electron thermal energy density and vth = kB T /me is the thermal speed. A correcting
factor is usually also employed and generally, based on Fokker-Planck simulations (e.g., Klimchuk et al. 2008), is taken
to be 1/6. The maximum electron heat flux (denoted by [S]) is therefore

We now proceed to derive the loop scaling laws that follow from the various expressions (5), (9), and (14) for the
conductive flux. For the collision-dominated and turbulence-limited cases, we start by recasting the energy equations
in the form (cf. Equation (3.11) of Rosner et al. 1978):

At this juncture Rosner et al. (1978) neglect the second term in the square brackets in the first of these equations,
arguing that near the base of the loop the primary energy balance is between heat flux and transition region radiative
losses. We shall proceed somewhat differently here. First, we note from Equation (18) that since the temperature
gradient vanishes at the loop apex (T = TM ),

It is important to note that in the case of collision-dominated conduction only positive powers of the temperature
appear in Equation (20), and therefore the base electron temperature T0 does not play a significant role in determining
the maximum temperature TM . Physically, this is because the temperature gradient dT /ds ∝ FC /T 5/2 ; thus the low
temperatures at the loop base mean that the temperature gradient is very large (compared to that in the corona) in
order to support the incident heat flux in the presence of a much lower thermal conduction coefficient. Quantitatively,
the thickness ℓ of a layer corresponding to a temperature range T1 < T < T1 + ∆T is given by ∆ℓ = (dT /ds)−1 ∆T ∝
T 5/2 ∆T , which is much smaller at the loop base (T ≃ T0 ) than in the corona (T ≃ TM ). Thus the amount of radiation
emitted within such a layer is negligible and the loop energetics are controlled principally by a balance between heat
conduction and radiation in the corona.
On the other hand, for turbulence-limited conduction the heat flux is reduced by a temperature-dependent factor
R ∝ T 3 (Equation (10)), so that the conductive coefficient in the expression for FT is inversely proportional to T :
FT ∝ T −1/2 dT /ds (Equation (12)). Thus the temperature gradient dT /ds ∝ FT T 1/2 (cf. Equations (9) and (10))
and the thickness of a layer corresponding to a temperature difference ∆T is ∆ℓ ∝ T −1/2 ∆T , a quantity that is now
larger at the loop base than in the corona (the temperature gradient need no longer steepen to support the incident
heat flux because it is turbulence-limited). As a result of this fundamentally different scaling of temperature gradient

6
with temperature, radiation from the low-temperature material near the base of the loop becomes more important than
radiation from the corona. This effect is sufficiently strong that the integral in Equation (19) becomes dominated by
the low-temperature, rather than the high-temperature, domain and, as a result, conditions at the loop base control
the scaling laws for the loop.
Using Equation (20) in Equation (19), we find that the loop half-length L = s(TM ) − s(T0 ) is given by

It should be noted that even though the physics is substantially different, the dependencies of both TM and EH on
p and L are identical for the collisional ([C]) and free-streaming ([S]) scaling laws (even though their coefficients are
a factor of 3-4 different).

2.2. Approximate Scaling Laws
We have seen above that for collision-dominated conduction the low temperature plasma can be neglected. Indeed,
if we ignore the low-temperature plasma in the loop and simply equate the magnitudes of the conductive and radiative
heating terms at the location of peak temperature, we obtain

This differs from the more exact scaling law in Equation (31) by the factor [(7/8) × (32/25)]1/6 ≃ 1.02, within 2% of

However, a similar simple exercise fails to determine the correct scaling laws for the case of turbulence-dominated
conduction, because it neglects the important role that radiation from the lower transition region plays in determining
the maximum loop temperature, and hence the conductive flux and the required heating rate to balance it.

Figure 1. Values of pertinent spatial scales for different conduction regimes. The slanted surface represents the quantity
(3/7) λC , while the red and green horizontal surfaces represent the quantities λT and (3/29/2 ) L, respectively (see Equation (41)).
The left figure corresponds to a turbulence scale λT = 107.5 cm (cf. Bian et al. 2016) and a loop half-length L = 109.5 cm
(3L/29/2 ≃ 108.6 cm); the right figure corresponds to a very long turbulence scale λT = 1010 cm (and so weak turbulence) and
the same loop half-length L. In both figures, the relative values of these three length scales are highlighted at two values of
the plasma temperature T (K) and density n (cm−3 ): (T = 106.2 , n = 1010.5 ) and (T = 107.5 , n = 109.0 ). For the latter set of
(n, T ) values the blue dot marks where the vertical line crosses the horizontal surfaces denoting the values of λT and (3/29/2 ) L,
respectively.

where ln Λ is the Coulomb logarithm. Since the conductive heat flux is proportional to the mean free path or length
scale, the ratio of the heat fluxes is simply the ratio of the corresponding scale lengths:

(41)

where λC is the collisional mean free path (Equation (10)).
In general, for a given set of physical conditions (temperature, density), the lowest of the three heat flux values
(collision-dominated, turbulence-dominated, free-streaming) controls the flow of heat and hence determines the pertinent conductive flux regime and associated scaling law. Since the heat flux is proportional to the corresponding length
scale (Equation (41)), the issue of selecting the pertinent conductive regime thus reduces to selecting which of the
three length scales in Equation (41) is the smallest.
Figure 1 compares the values of the three length scales in Equation (41), for two cases: (λT , L) = (107.5 , 109.5 ) cm
(left panel), and (λT , L) = (1010 , 109.5 ) cm (right panel). Figure 2 shows a slice through each of the 3D plots in
Figure 1 at T = 107 K by way of an example.
The results are as follows:
• [λT = 107.5 cm, L = 109.5 cm.] In this case, for the first set of parameters (T = 106.2 K, n = 1010.5 cm−3 ),
the collision-related scale is the lowest and hence determines the rate of heat loss by conduction; in such a case
the pertinent scaling laws are the Rosner et al. (1978) scaling laws – denoted by [C] in Equations (31) and (32).
For the second set of parameters (T = 107.5 K, n = 109.0 cm−3 ), the lowest scale length is the turbulence scale
length λT = 107 cm (blue dot on red horizontal surface in left panel of Figure 1; in such a case the pertinent
scaling laws are those denoted by [T ] in Equations (31) and (32).
• [λT = 1010 cm, L = 109.5 cm.] For the first set of parameters (T = 106.2 K, n = 1010.5 cm−3 ), the collisionrelated scale is still the lowest; the pertinent scaling laws are still the Rosner et al. (1978) scaling laws – denoted
by [C] in Equations (31) and (32). For the second set of parameters (T = 107.5 K, n = 109.0 cm−3 ), the lowest
scale length is now that related to the loop half-length L (blue dot on green horizontal surface in right panel of
Figure 1; in such a case the heat conduction is controlled by free-streaming and the pertinent scaling laws are
now those denoted by [S] in Equations (31) and (32)

Figure 2. Values of pertinent spatial scales in different conduction regimes for L = 109.5 cm and T = 107 K. The diagonal line
represents the quantity (3/7)λC , while the dashed horizontal lines represent the quantities λT and (3/2)9/2 L, respectively. The
dot-dashed vertical lines correspond to n = 108.5 cm−3 and n = 1010.5 cm−3 . The circles show where each of these vertical lines
meet the lowest pertinent scale, and hence the relevant conduction and scaling-law regime. Thus, for λT = 107.5 cm, conduction
is controlled by turbulence if n = 108.5 cm−3 and by collisions if n = 1010.5 cm−3 ; whereas for λT = 1010 cm, conduction is
controlled by free-streaming if n = 108.5 cm−3 and by collisions if n = 1010.5 cm−3 .
4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper has extended the work of Rosner et al. (1978) to include situations where the thermal conductive flux that
redistributes heat within a coronal loop is governed by processes other than Coulomb collisions, specifically turbulent
scattering and free-streaming. Equations (31) and (32) provide the pertinent scaling laws for peak temperature TM ,
and volumetric heating rate EH , respectively in terms of the loop pressure p and half-length L. It is notable that,
because of the much weaker dependence of the thermal conduction coefficient κ on temperature for the case of turbulent
scattering by magnetic fluctuations, the characteristics of the loop in such a regime are governed not by the highest
temperatures in the loop (as they are for both the collisional and free-streaming cases), but by conditions at the
low-temperature (transition region) part of the loop.
Which of these scaling laws is appropriate in a particular environment depends on the ratios of the turbulent scale
length λT to the collisional mean free path λC to the loop half-length L (Equation (41)). Figure 1 illustrates examples
where each process, and hence scaling law, dominates.
Given the likely role of turbulence in active region loops, particularly those associated with flaring activity (Bian et al.
2018, and references therein), and modern observations of the faint, hot component of emission in non-flaring active
regions, considered a signature of impulsive heating (e.g., Reale et al. 2009a,b; Schmelz et al. 2009a,b; Testa et al. 2011;
Miceli et al. 2012; Brosius et al. 2014; Petralia et al. 2014; Marsh et al. 2018), that allow more precise estimation of
loop temperatures and densities (and of the presence of turbulence; Kontar et al. 2017), we encourage the comparison
of observed loop parameters with these extended scaling laws, as a possible diagnostic of the physical conditions in
active region coronal loops and hence of the energy required to create and sustain them.
