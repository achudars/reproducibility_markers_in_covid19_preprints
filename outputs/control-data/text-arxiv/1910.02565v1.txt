COMPLETE KÄHLER-EINSTEIN METRIC ON STEIN
MANIFOLDS WITH NEGATIVE CURVATURE
MAN-CHUN LEE
Abstract. We show the existence of complete negative Kähler-Einstein
metric on Stein manifolds with negatively pinched holomorphic sectional
curvature. We prove that any Kähler metrics on such manifolds can be
deformed to the complete negative Kähler-Einstein metric using the normalized Kähler-Ricci flow.

1. introduction
In [22], Wu and Yau proved that if a complete noncompact Kähler manifold supports a complete bounded curvature Kähler metric with holomorphic
sectional curvature bounded from above by a negative constant, then it supports a complete negative Kähler-Einstein metric with bounded curvature.
This extended the previous work [23, 19] to the noncompact case. Using the
Kähler-Ricci flow approach, this was recovered by Tong [20], see also the compact case in [14]. A natural question is to ask if the curvature boundedness
assumption is necessary in order to obtain the existence of Kähler-Einstein
without bounded curvature conclusion. In [9], the author together with the
collaborators showed that the curvature boundedness assumption can be weakened to the existence of a exhaustion function with bounded complex hessian.
The main ingredient is the construction of long-time Kähler-Ricci flow solution
using Chern-Ricci flow approximation technique introduced by the author and
Tam in [12].
In this note, we continue to study the existence problem using the KählerRicci flow approach. We focus on the special case when M is a Stein manifold.
We show the existence of complete negative Kähler-Einstein on M by establishing a long-time solution to the Kähler-Ricci flow on M. More precisely,
we showed that on the negatively curved Stein manifold M, the Kähler-Ricci
flow has a long-time solution starting from any Kähler metric which can be
incomplete and have unbounded curvature.
Theorem 1.1. Suppose M n is a Stein manifold and h is a complete Kähler
metric on M with holomorphic sectional curvature Hh ≤ −κ for some κ > 0.
Then any Kähler metric g0 on M admits a longtime solution to the KählerRicci flow on M × [0, +∞) such that g(t) is instantaneous complete for t > 0.

On general Kähler manifold, the short-time existence of the Kähler-Ricci
flow was first studied by Shi [17, 18] when the initial metric g0 is complete
with bounded curvature. In general without curvature condition, the existence
theory was still being unclear except the surface case. In the case of surface,
the existence of the Ricci flow starting from incomplete metric has been studied
in details by Giesen and Topping [3, 4, 5]. This can be viewed as a partial
generalization of their result in higher dimension.
By combining the existence with the convergence result in [9], we have the
existence of the complete negative Kähler-Einstein metric.
Corollary 1.1. Suppose M is a Stein manifold and h is a complete Kähler
metric on M with holomorphic sectional curvature Hh ≤ −κ for some κ > 0,
then M admits a unique complete Kähler-Einstein metric with negative scalar
curvature.
Using Corollary 1.1, we know that the following situation admit complete
negative Kähler-Einstein metric.
Example 1.1. Using a result of Wu [21] and Corollary 1.1, any complete simply connected Kähler manifold (M, g) with sectional curvature bounded from
above by −1 admits a complete negative Kähler-Einstein metric.
Example 1.2. Let Bn−1 be the unit ball in Cn , then any proper embedded
complex sub-manifold Σ of Bn−1 admits a complete negative Kähler-Einstein
metric. To see this, Bn−1 admits the Bergman metric h with constant holomorphic sectional curvature. By the decreasing property of holomorphic curvature
and properness, the pull-back metric of h on Σ is a complete Kähler metric
with holomorphic sectional curvature bounded from above by negative value.
Then the existence followed from Corollary 1.1.
Example 1.3. Let D be the unit disk in C associated with the Poincaré metric.
Let Σ be a proper embedded complex sub-manifold Σ of Dn = D × · · · × D.
The produce metric on Dn is complete with holomorphic sectional curvature
bounded from above by negative value. Then Σ admits a complete negative
Kähler-Einstein metric using the argument in previous example.
2. a-priori estimates for the Kähler-Ricci flow
Let M n be a complex manifold. The Kähler-Ricci flow on M starting from
initial metric g0 is a family of Kähler metric g(t) which satisfies
(
∂
g = −Rij̄ ;
(2.1)
∂t ij̄
g(0) = g0 .
on M × [0, T ] for some T > 0. We say that g(t) is a complete solution if g(t)
is a complete metric on M for each t ∈ [0, T ].

Lemma 2.1. Let g(t) be a complete solution to the Kähler-Ricci flow on Ω ×
[0, T ] for T ≤ +∞. Suppose h is a Kähler metric on Ω which can possibly
be incomplete such that its holomorphic sectional curvature is bounded from
above by −κ for some κ > 0. Then on Ω × (0, T ], g(t) satisfies
(n + 1)κt
h ≤ g(t).

L → +∞.

We also have a instantaneous bound on the scalar curvature.
Lemma 2.2. Let g(t) be a complete solution to the Kähler-Ricci flow on Ω ×
[0, T ] for T ≤ +∞, then the scalar curvature satisfies

Proof. Noted that the scalar curvature R satisfies ∂t
− ∆t R ≥ n1 R2 . The
proof is similar to the that in Lemma 2.1 by applying [9, Lemma 5.1] with
Q = −R.

We also need the following version of pseudolocality of Ricci flow from [7].
Proposition 2.1. For any m ∈ N and v > 0, there is σ(m, v), Λ(m, v) >
0 such that if g(t) is a complete Ricci flow solution on M m × [0, T ] with
sup[τ,T ] |Rm(g(t))| < +∞ for all τ > 0 and satisfies
(1) |Rm(g(0))| ≤ r −2 on Bg0 (p, r);
(2) Vg0 (Bg0 (p, r)) ≥ r m v,

4

for some p ∈ M and r > 0, then we have

|Rm(x, t)| ≤ Λr −2

on Bg(t) (p, σr), t ≤ min{T, σ 2 r 2 }.

Proof. The follows by applying [7, Corollary 3.1] to the rescaled Ricci flow
solution r −2 g(r 2t) and then rescale it back.

3. approximation using pseudoconvex domain
In this section, we will construct local Kähler-Ricci flow solution using the
Steinness of M. By a result of Grauert [10], there exists a smooth strictly
pluri-subharmonic function ρ on M which is a exhaustion function. For R > 1
large, denote its sublevel set to be
UR = {x ∈ M : ρ(x) < R}.
This is a bounded strictly pseudo-convex domain in M as defined in [2]. By
Sard’s Theorem, we may find a sequence of Rm → +∞ such that dρ 6= 0 on
∂URm . By the result in [2], there exists a complete Kähler-Einstein metric
ω̃m = −Ric(ω̃m ) with bounded curvature defined on URm . Now we will construct approximating Kähler-Ricci flow using {(URm , ω̃m )}m∈N . Let ω0 be the
Kähler form of the initial metric g0 . On URm , define ω0,m,ǫ = ω0 + ǫω̃m . We
will use g0,m,ǫ to denote the corresponding Kähler metric.
Lemma 3.1. For any ǫ > 0, ω0,m,ǫ = ω0 + ǫω̃m is a complete Kähler metric
on URm which is uniformly equivalent to ω̃m .
Proof. The completeness is clear. It remains to establish the upper bound of
ω0,m,ǫ with respect to ω̃m . Since ρij̄ > 0 and URm is pre-compact in M, there
is Cm >> 1 such that
√
¯
(3.1)
ω0 ≤ Cm −1∂ ∂ρ
On the other hand by [2], ω̃m is uniformly equivalent to the standard
on URm . √
metric − −1∂ ∂¯ log(R − ρ) on URm . Therefore,
√
¯
ω0 ≤ Cm −1∂ ∂ρ
√
(3.2)
≤ −Cm −1∂ ∂¯ log(R − ρ)
≤ C ω̃m .
This completes the proof.



Using the uniform equivalence of metrics, we can deform the Kähler metric
using the Kähler-Ricci flow on each URm with long-time existence.
Proposition 3.1. There exists a complete long-time solution ωm,ǫ (t) to the
Kähler-Ricci flow with initial metric ω0,m,ǫ on URm × [0, +∞) such that ωm,ǫ (t)
is uniformly equivalent to ω̃m on any [a, b] ⊂ [0, +∞).

Proof. From Lemma 3.1, there exists δ > 0 such that

ω0,m,ǫ ≤ δ −1 ω̃m ;
(3.3)
ω0,m,ǫ − sRic(ω̃m ) > δ ω̃m .

for any s > 0. The proposition follows from [1, Theorem 1.4].

4. Proof of main theorem
In this section, we will construct a global longtime solution g(t) to the
Kähler-Ricci flow with initial metric g(0) = g0 using the idea in [4] adapted
in higher dimensional Kähler case. The main goal is to show that g(t) =
limm→+∞ limǫ→0 gm,ǫ (t) exists. In [8, 1], it was showed that gm (t) = limǫi → gm,ǫi (t)
exists smoothly up to t = 0 for some subsequence ǫi → 0 using estimates from
parabolic Monge-Ampère equation. Since the information of Ric(h) on M is
missing, we need to take an alternative approach to obtain the estimates for
compactness when m → +∞.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. From the discussion in section 3, there is a sequence of
bounded strictly pseudo-convex domain URm exhausting M. Moreover, there
is a sequence of complete Kähler-Ricci flow gm,ǫ (t) defined on URm × [0, +∞)
with gm,ǫ (0) = g0,m,ǫ . Because of completeness, we may apple Lemma 2.1 and
Lemma 2.2 to deduce that for all t ∈ [0, +∞),
(
(n + 1)κt
h ≤ gm,ǫ (t);
(4.1)
2n
Rgm,ǫ (t) ≥ −nt−1 .
Here we regard h as a incomplete metric on the pre-compact set URm . Moreover by uniform equivalence with a metric with bounded curvature, the KählerRicci flow gm,ǫ (t) has bounded curvature when t > 0, for example see [1, 16, 13].
Fix a compact set Ω ⋐ M, since g0,m,ǫ converges to g0 uniformly in any C k
as ǫ → 0 and m → +∞, we can find r > 0 and v > 0 small enough such that
for all x ∈ Ω, m large and ǫ0 (n, m, g0 , Ω) > ǫ > 0, we have
(a) Bg0,m,ǫ (x, r) ⋐ URm ;
(b) |Rm(g0,m,ǫ )| ≤ r −2 on Bg0,m,ǫ (x, r);
(c) Vg0,m,ǫ Bg0,m,ǫ (x, r) ≥ vr 2n .
By Proposition 2.1, for all m large and ǫ < ǫ0 (n, m, g0 , Ω), we have
(4.2)

sup |Rm(gm,ǫ )(x, t)| ≤ Λ(n, g0 , Ω)
Ω

for 0 ≤ t ≤ σ(n, g0 , Ω). In particular, for all (x, t) ∈ Ω × [0, σ],

(4.3)

e−Λσ g0,m,ǫ ≤ gm,ǫ (t) ≤ eΛσ g0,m,ǫ .

For t > σ, we make use of (4.1). Using the evolution of volume form with
the second inequality in (4.1), we have

Using (4.3), (4.6) and the fact that g0,m,ǫ converges to g0 locally uniformly,
in conclusion we have shown that for any T < ∞ and compact set Ω ⋐ M,
there is λ > 1 such that for all m sufficiently large, ǫ sufficiently small and
t ∈ [0, T ],
λ−1 h ≤ gm,ǫ (t) ≤ λh.
By applying higher order estimate of the Kähler-Ricci flow [16] on local
chart, we have all higher order estimates of gm,ǫ (t) on Ω × [0, T ] which is
independent of m >> 1 and ǫ < ǫ0 (n, m, g0 , Ω).
By Ascoli-Arzelà Theorem, for each m large we may first let ǫi → 0 for some
subsequence ǫi to obtain a Kähler-Ricci flow solution gm (t), t ∈ [0, T ] on each
URm . Then by diagonal subsequence argument and Ascoli-Arzelà Theorem
again, we may let mi → +∞ and followed by T → +∞ to obtain a global
solution g(t) of the Kähler-Ricci flow on M × [0, +∞). The instantaneous
completeness of g(t) followed by passing (4.1) to the limiting solution g(t). 
Proof of Corollary 1.1. By Theorem 1.1, there is a long-time solution to the
Kähler-Ricci flow starting from h. The existence of complete negative KählerEinstein followed from [9, Theorem 5.1].

Remark 4.1. It is clear from the proof of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.1 that
the reference metric h can be a incomplete metric. Then the resulting KählerRicci flow solution and Kähler-Einstein metric maybe a incomplete metric.
Remark 4.2. Since h only served as a reference metric in the Schwarz Lemma,
the existence of Kähler metric h can be replaced by the existence of a Hermitian
metric with negatively pinched real bisectional curvature, see [24, 11].
