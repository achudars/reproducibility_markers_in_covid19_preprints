ABSTRACT

Manganese (Mn) is a key Fe-group elements, commonly employed in stellar population and nucleosynthesis studies to explore the
role of SN Ia. We have developed a new non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model of Mn, including new photo-ionisation
cross-sections and new transition rates caused by collisions with H and H− atoms. We applied the model in combination with 1dimensional (1D) LTE model atmospheres and 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar convection to quantify the impact of NLTE
and convection on the line formation. We show that the effects of NLTE are present in Mn I and, to a lesser degree, in Mn II lines,
and these increase with metallicity and with effective temperature of a model. Employing 3D NLTE radiative transfer, we derive new
abundance of Mn in the Sun, A(Mn)= 5.52 ± 0.03 dex, consistent with the element abundance in C I meteorites. We also apply our
methods to the analysis of three metal-poor benchmark stars. We find that 3D NLTE abundances are significantly higher than 1D
LTE. For dwarfs, the differences between 1D NLTE and 3D NLTE abundances are typically within 0.15 dex, however, the effects
are much larger in the atmospheres of giants owing to their more vigorous convection. We show that 3D NLTE successfully solves
the ionisation and excitation balance for the RGB star HD 122563 that cannot be achieved by 1D LTE or 1D NLTE modelling.
For HD 84937 and HD 140283, the ionisation balance is satisfied, however, the resonance Mn I triplet lines still show somewhat
lower abundances compared to the high-excitation lines. Our results for the benchmark stars confirm that 1D LTE modelling leads to
significant systematic biases in Mn abundances across the full wavelength range from the blue to the IR. We also produce a list of Mn
lines that are not significantly biased by 3D and can be reliably, within the 0.1 dex uncertainty, modelled in 1D NLTE.

1. Introduction
Manganese (Mn) is a prominent member of the iron-group family that has interesting connections to several topics in astrophysics. In particular, from the point of view of stellar nucleosynthesis, this element is very sensitive to the physical conditions in supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) (Seitenzahl et al. 2013).
Hence, the abundances of Mn in metal-poor stars provide powerful constraints on the progenitors and explosion mechanism of
this important class of SNe.
Mn displays a large number of Mn i lines spanning a range
of excitation potentials in the optical spectra of late-type stars
(Bergemann & Gehren 2007). Also a few lines of Mn ii can
be detected in the blue at ∼ 350 nm, and some strong lines of
Mn i are available in the infra-red at 1.52 µm. Owing to the large
number of observable lines, Mn is a useful element to test the
excitation and ionisation equilibria in stellar atmospheres. The
lines of both ionisation stages are affected by hyperfine splitting

(HFS), and some are also very sensitive to stellar activity. For
example, the resonance Mn i line at 5394 Å is known to vary
across the solar cycle (Vitas et al. 2009; Danilovic et al. 2016).
A large number of studies over the past years have been devoted to the analysis of Mn abundances in the context of stellar population studies and nucleosynthesis. Most of these works
have assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). There is,
however, evidence for the breakdown of the LTE assumption.
Johnson (2002) reported a systematic ionisation imbalance of
Mn i andMn ii in metal-poor stars. Bonifacio et al. (2009) found
a 0.2 dex offset between the abundances of Mn in metal-poor
dwarfs and giants. They also observe a significant excitation imbalance, with strong Mn i resonance lines resulting in significantly lower abundances compared to the high-excitation features. Sneden et al. (2016) confirm the excitation imbalance in
LTE, but they also find that the ionisation balance is satisfied, if
one relies on the high-excitation Mn i lines only. However, that
study employed one star only, HD 84937, which can make it difArticle number, page 1 of 31

ficult to generalise these conclusions to a large sample. Mishenina et al. (2015) also employed LTE models to analyse a large
sample of main-sequence stars in the metallicity range from −1
to +0.3. Their abundances suggests a modest systematic correlation with T eff , signifying potential departures from LTE and 1D
hydrostatic equilibrium.
In earlier studies (Bergemann & Gehren 2007, 2008), we
showed that Mn is very sensitive to departures from LTE, also
known as Non-LTE (hereafter, NLTE) effects. This is an element
of the Fe-group, and is expected to be similar to Fe in terms of
line formation properties. However, given its two orders of magnitude lower abundance (in the cosmic abundance scale) compared to Fe, but also significantly higher photo-ionisation crosssections, and a peculiar atomic structure, with a very large number of strong radiative transitions between energy levels with excitation potentials of 2 and 4 eV, Mn is prone to stronger NLTE
effects than Fe. In particular, it was shown, on the basis of detailed statistical equilibrium (SE) calculations, that NLTE Mn
abundances are significantly higher compared to LTE, and this
effect increases with decreasing metallicity of a star and increasing its T eff , but also with decreasing log g.
Line formation across the solar granulation has been extensively discussed in the literature, in particular in the series of
seminal papers by Dravins et al. (1981); Dravins (1987); Dravins
& Nordlund (1990b,a); Nordlund & Dravins (1990), but see also
more recent studies of the solar center-to-limb variation (e.g.
Lind et al. 2017) and solar abundances (e.g. Caffau et al. 2008,
2009; Asplund et al. 2009; Caffau et al. 2010, 2011; Amarsi &
Asplund 2017; Amarsi et al. 2018a, 2019a). Recently, this work
has been extended towards 3D NLTE modelling of spectral line
formation in other stars and applied to the lines of H, O, Si, and
Al (Amarsi et al. 2016; Nordlander & Lind 2017; Amarsi et al.
2018b, 2019b).
Given the interest in the impact of NLTE and 3D diagnostic
on the abundance measurements, we present a re-analysis of Mn
abundances in a small sample of well-studied FGK stars using an
updated NLTE model atom, and 1D hydrostatic and 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres. We use new atomic data, including
transition probabilities, photo-ionisation cross-sections, and rate
coefficients for the transitions caused by the inelastic collisions
of Mn i and Mn ii ions with H atoms. We compare the results
of two 1D statistical equilibrium codes, DETAIL and MULTI2.3
that are both widely used in the community for NLTE analyses
of chemical abundances. We also perform full 3D NLTE radiative transfer calculations with the MULTI3D code (Leenaarts &
Carlsson 2009) to derive Mn abundance from the high-resolution
spectra of the Sun and several metal-poor stars.
The paper is organised as follows: In Sect. 2, we describe
the observed spectra. The LTE and NLTE calculations in 1D
and 3D, spectrum synthesis, and abundance analysis are documented in Sect. 3. We present a considerable amount of details
about the methods of calculations, because this is very important
for a judgement of the resulting abundances. The results are presented in Sect. 4. They include the discussion of 1D NLTE and
3D NLTE abundance corrections, the analysis of the solar Mn
abundance, a comparison between 3D LTE and 3D NLTE line
profiles, and the excitation-ionisation balance of Mn i/Mn ii in
benchmark metal-poor stars. We close with a summary of the
results and conclusions in Sect. 5.

2. Observations
For the Sun, we use the high-resolution flux atlas taken with
the KPNO facility (Kurucz et al. 1984). The atlas has a resolvArticle number, page 2 of 31

ing power R ∼ 400 000. Recently, solar spectra taken with the
PEPSI instrument at Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) (Strassmeier et al. 2018) and with the Fourier transform spectrograph
operated by the Institut fuer Astrophysik in Goettingen (Reiners
et al. 2016) were released. However, the profiles of Mn lines are
very similar in all these atlases. Hence, we employ the KPNO
spectrum in this work.
We also include several metal-poor benchmark stars (HD
84937, HD 140283, HD 122563) from Bergemann et al. (2012).
Their spectra are taken from the UVES-POP database (Bagnulo et al. 2003). These are the Gaia benchmark stars with T eff
and log g determined using interferometry and astrometry. The
estimates of [Fe/H] and micro-turbulence were derived using
NLTE radiative transfer for Fe lines (Bergemann et al. 2012).
The effective temperatures of two of these stars were recently
revised (Karovicova et al. 2018). The new estimates, based on
the CHARA angular diameters, are T eff = 5787 ± 48 K for HD
140283 and T eff = 4636 ± 37 K for HD 122563. These estimates
are fully consistent with the values we adopted in Bergemann
et al. (2012). Creevey et al. (2019) propose a new asteroseismic
surface gravity for HD 122563, log g = 1.39 ± 0.01 dex. This
is a substantial downward revision of this parameter. However,
we tested the effect of log g on the abundance estimates from
Mn lines, but found that the abundances change by only 0.05
dex. Hence we do not recompute the model and use the standard
models employed in Bergemann et al. (2012).

3. Analysis
3.1. Model atom and diagnostic lines of Mn

The model comprises three ionisation stages and 281 energy levels, with 198 levels of Mn i, 81 levels of Mn ii, and the model
is closed by the Mn iii ground state. The radiative transitions
are taken from the Kurucz compilation 1 , which includes theoretically predicted and experimental estimates of the oscillator
strengths, with the latter given a preference over theoretical estimates. The Mn i part of the model atom is shown in Fig. 1. We
do not show the Mn ii system in this plot. The ionised specie
has a very high ionisation potential and the bulk of Mn ii lines,
which connect the levels do not play any role in the SE of the
element (see also the discussion of model atom completeness in
Bergemann & Gehren 2008). In contrast to the latter study, we
do not include fine structure for most of the Mn ii levels, except
those, which are relevant for the Mn ii near-UV lines used in detailed abundance measurements. The full atom is provided in the
MULTI2.3 format as a supplementary material in this paper (see
online version).
We include fine structure levels for all energies up to 47 300
cm−1 , however, we also test the results using a compact model
atom, which is devoid of fine structure for the majority of levels.
This is important for our test calculations with full 3D simulations of stellar convection.
The atomic data for the Mn i lines, which we employ in the
abundance calculations are given in Table 1. For all of them, the
hyperfine structure (HFS) is included in the model atom directly.
That is, the HFS structure of spectral lines was computed for
all diagnostic lines of Mn i and Mn ii, and included in the radiative transition part of the MULTI model atom. We employed the
magnetic dipole constants A and electric quadrupole constants
B assembled by Bergemann & Gehren (2008), complementing these with the data from Holt et al. (1999) for the relevant

Mn ii levels, a 5 D and z 5 P◦ . The full HFS patterns for each Mn
line is provided in the Appendix. In the statistical equilibrium
(SE) calculations, we treat the diagnostic Mn i and Mn ii lines
with Voigt profiles, while all other Mn lines were computed with
a Gaussian profile with 13 frequency points. Our tests show that
increasing the number of frequency points does not change the
statistical equilibrium of the ion, on the other hand with this
choice we still have a reasonable frequency quadrature to accurately represent each line profile.
We use the new experimental transition probabilities, where
these are available. Most data are taken from BlackwellWhitehead & Bergemann (2007) and Den Hartog et al. (2011).
For some of the lines, the new log g f values are typically 0.05 to
0.1 dex lower than the old values, that ultimately leads to slightly
higher abundances compared to our earlier work. The broadening due to elastic collisions with H atoms is adopted from
Barklem et al. (2000), where available. These data are derived
using the 2nd order Rayleigh-Schroedinger perturbation theory
as formulated by Brueckner (1971) and later generalised to transitions between different azimuthal quantum number states by
O’Mara (1976), Anstee & O’Mara (1991), and Anstee & O’Mara
(1995). This theory offers a more accurate representation of H
+ atom collision broadening than the theory by Unsöld (1927);
Unsold (1955). The latter theory assumes that only collisions
at large separations between atoms strongly influence the line
broadening, thus severely under-estimating the line strengths.
The main difference in this work with respect to our earlier
studies (Bergemann & Gehren 2008) is the implementation of
the new photo-ionisation cross-sections for Mn i and the new
rates of inelastic collisions due to the interactions of Mn i with
H i atoms.
3.1.1. Photoionisation

We adopt new quantum-mechanical photoionisation crosssections for 84 LS terms of Mn i, which belong to the configurations 3d6 , 3d 5 4s, 3d 5 4p, 3d4 4s2 . The photo-ionisation crosssections for dipole allowed transitions in Mn i were computed
using the R-matrix method for atomic scattering calculations
(Berrington et al. 1987). The solution of the Schrödinger equation for the N+1 electron system is found on the basis of the

The calculations are done in LS-coupling and include all

that represent the atomic structure of the Mn+ target, were derived using the AUTOSTRUCTURE code (Badnell 1997). The
code employs scaled Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-Amaldi central-field
potential. We adopt configuration interactions expansion with

Fig. 2. Photo-ionisation cross-section of the 3d5 4s2 a 6 S ground term
of Mn i. The present R-matrix cross section is depicted by the solid
line. The central-field cross sections of Verner & Yakovlev (1995) and
Reilman & Manson (1979) are indicated by the dashed line and square
dots, respectively. Above the figure we show the energies of all 3d5 4s,
3d6 , and 3d4 4s2 thresholds.

Mn ii ion included in the close coupling expansion are provided
in Table B.1 in the Appendix.
The cross-sections are sampled at 5 000 evenly-spaced energy points between zero and 0.8 Ryd above the first ionisation
threshold, followed by 250 points from 0.8 Ryd to 2.0 Ryd. This
mesh is also preserved in our NLTE calculations with DETAIL
and with MULTI2.3, such that all resonances are fully accounted
for in the statistical equilibrium calculations. These resonances
are mostly caused by the photo-excitation of the core and dominate the cross-sections of the majority of Mn i states. For the
other levels, we employ hydrogenic cross-sections sampled on
a regular mesh. The hydrogenic cross-sections were computed
using the effective principal quantum number.
Figure 2 shows the total photo-ionisation cross-section for
the ground state of Mn i, compared with the central field approximation results of Verner & Yakovlev (1995) and Reilman &
Manson (1979). The close coupling expansion accounts for the
photoionisation of the outer 4s sub-shell, as well as, the open
inner 3d sub-shell of the ground state 3d5 4s2 6 S of Mn. The
coupling of all relevant photo-ionisation channels results in extensive auto-ionisation structures and ensures that no sharp discontinuity in the cross-section at the 3d inner-shell ionisation
edge is present. By contrast, the central field approximation,
which misses channel couplings, yields a cross-section, which
is severely underestimated up to the opening of the 3d sub-shell,
where a discontinuity appears. The importance of channel couplings in representing low energy photoionisation cross-sections
of iron-peak elements is well known (Bautista & Pradhan 1995).
For energies beyond the 3d sub-shell, the central field crosssections agree very well with our data, which gives additional
confidence on the accuracy of our results. Fig. A.1 in Appendix
also show the comparison of the cross-sections with the hydrogenic data. Clearly the differences are substantial and amount
to several orders of magnitude in the background, but also all
resonances that contribute to the over-ionisation at longer wavelengths are missing in the hydrogenic data.
DETAIL does not have a provision for including the partial
ionisation channels to specific states of the target ion. Hence,
we adopt the total photo-ionisation cross-sections, computed by
adding the partial cross-sections for each Mn i state.

The rate coefficients for the bound-bound transitions in
Mn i caused by collisions with H atoms, as well as for Mn ii collisions with H− , were taken from Belyaev & Voronov (2017), but
we also compute new rates for these processes in this work.
The data from Belyaev & Voronov (2017) are available for
the transitions between 19 levels2 of Mn i interacting with H and
the ground state of Mn ii interacting with H− . They represent
collisional excitation, de-excitation, mutual neutralisation, and
ion-pair formation3 due to the transitions between 7 Σ+ molecular states.
Here we present new calculations of the H i collision rates
for 71 additional levels of Mn i interacting with H and the first
excited state of Mn ii interacting with H− . The first excited ionic
state of MnH molecule has the 5 Σ+ symmetry and only covalent molecular states of the same symmetry are considered in the
non-adiabatic nuclear dynamical calculations. These states are
listed in Table B.3 in the Appendix.
All calculations are performed within the simplified quantum model (Belyaev & Yakovleva 2017b,a), which allows to
find a rate coefficient for a particular process using general dependences of the reduced rate coefficients on the electron binding energies. The binding energies are calculated from different
ionic limits for the cases of non-adiabatic transitions between
7 +
Σ molecular states and between 5 Σ+ states. The rate coefficients for the excitation and de-excitation processes are summed
over molecular symmetry, when the initial and the final state of
the process have both 7 Σ+ and 5 Σ+ symmetries.
Neutralisation rate coefficients for collisions of
Mn+ (3d5 4s 5 S) + H− are presented in Fig. 3 as a function
of the electron binding energy. For the case of MnH collisional
system involving quintet molecular states, the largest rate
coefficients at 6000 K correspond to the mutual neutralisation
processes to Mn(3d54s4p u6 P◦ ) + H, Mn(3d54s5d f 6 D) + H,
Mn(3d54s4f w6 F◦ ) + H, Mn(3d54s6p t6 P◦ ) + H states and they
have values ∼ 6 × 10−8 cm3 /s. The rate coefficients for the
(de-) excitation processes are, at least, one order of magnitude
lower than the rates for the neutralisation/ion-pair formation
processes, as found in previous calculations for other chemical
elements (Belyaev, Andrey K. et al. 2014; Belyaev et al. 2017;
Yakovleva et al. 2017).
We also derive new rate coefficients for the 42 levels of
Mn ii interacting with H and for the ground state of Mn iii interacting with H− . These calculations are performed for the
transitions between 6 Σ+ molecular states as the ionic state of
MnH+ has 6 Σ+ symmetry. The states are presented in Table
B.4 in the Appendix. Neutralisation rate coefficients for collisions Mn2+ (3d5 6 S) + H− as a function of the electron bound
energy are shown in Fig. 4. The largest rate coefficient for the
case of MnH+ collisions at 6000 K with the value of 7.5 ×
10−8 cm3 /s corresponds to the mutual neutralisation process
Mn2+ (3d5 6 S) + H− → Mn+ (3d5 5p v5 P◦ ) + H.
Our data apply to J-averaged energy states, but the NLTE
model atom includes fine structure. We have tested different
recipes that are used in the literature to deal with this case. In
particular, Barklem (2007) propose to divide the fine-structure
summed rate coefficient by the number of the targets states.
2
Molecular states Mn(3d6 4p z6 D◦ ) + H and Mn(3d5 4s4p y6 D◦ ) + H
are excluded from the calculations because they have 7 Σ− symmetry,
while other considered states have 7 Σ+ symmetry.

We emphasise that all these processes are bound-bound transitions,
in which electrons remain bound to Mn or to H atoms, and are referred
this way in the text.

tion occurs from j to i), because these are almost independent
of temperature, which minimises interpolation errors. For the
charge transfer, the reverse is true, hence we tabulate the rates
of endothermic processes. The reverse rates are computed from
the detailed balance internally within the code, i.e. see eq. 5 in
Belyaev & Voronov 2017 (note that neither nH nor nH− explicitly
enter these equations):

as a function of the electronic energy in different excited states of Mn ii .
Dashed line represents the reduced rate coefficient given by the simplified model.

However, we found that the effect of distributing the collision
rate coefficients across the target states is virtually null. In particular, for the high-excitation Mn i lines in the model of a metalpoor dwarf, this leads to an error in the line equivalent width of
less than 0.1 %, which is negligibly small for abundance determinations. We, hence, assign the same rate coefficient for each
fine structure level of a given term4 . This is analogous to our
handling of the photo-ionisation data, which are also provided
for a given term. The new rate coefficients are available in the
supplementary material.
In the model atom, we tabulate the rates of exothermic processes for the bound-bound reactions, i.e. the transitions accompanied by the release of energy (E j > Ei , where the transi4

where ri j and r ji are rate coefficients for the transition from the
lower energy level i to the higher energy level j, gi and g j the
statistical weights of these levels, and E ji the energy difference
("energy defect") between the energies of the two states.
Apart from the radial avoided crossing mechanism, one
can estimate additional rate coefficients using the free electron
model, which is expected to include other inelastic mechanisms
except the long-range ionic covalent mechanism (Barklem 2016;
Amarsi, A. M. et al. 2018; Amarsi et al. 2019a). We hence also
supplement the model atom with collision rates for all Mn i states
computed using the scattering-length approximation5 according
to eq. 18 of Kaulakys (1991) using the code of Barklem (2017).
As described Osorio et al. (2015) and Barklem (2016), the rate
coefficients computed in this way need to be redistributed over
all possible final spine states. Here, we assume that all transitions have two possible final spin states, and that each final spin
state is equally likely, so that the rate coefficients were reduced
by a factor of two. The error associated with this assumption is
less than a factor of two. The Kaulakys model is developed for
application to Rydberg molecular states, hence, our implementation shall be viewed as a limiting case with strong collisional
binding, and, hence, might under-estimate NLTE effects.
In Fig. 5 we compare the new H collision rates with the data
computed using the Steenbock & Holweger (1984) formulation
of the classical theory developed by Drawin (1968, 1969). The
classical formalism does not cover the mutual neutralisation and
ion-pair formation processes. The differences in the H excitation rates for the individual energy levels amount up to 7 orders of magnitude in both directions. The overall distributions
as a function of energy difference have similar shapes, with the
largest rate coefficients for the transitions between nearby energy levels. The rate coefficients for the charge transfer reactions
are also qualitatively similar to the Drawin’s bound-free recipe,
which describes collisional ionisation, but quantitatively there
are major differences of up to 5 orders of magnitude. For the
neutral species, the quantum-mechanical charge transfer rates
are typically lower, whereas for the singly-ionised species these
are larger than the Drawin. The Kaulakys rates are typically very
low for the low-energy levels, but gradually increase closer to the
ionisation threshold and thus somewhat compensate the downturn in the quantum-mechanical data, leading to higher collisional thermalisation. In sect. 4.1.2 we briefly report on how this
impacts the line profiles and the NLTE abundance corrections.
3.2. Model atmospheres

As in our previous papers, we use MARCS (Gustafsson et al.
2008) and MAFAGS-OS (Grupp 2004a,b) model atmosphere
grids. These are 1D LTE model atmospheres, with certain differences regarding the treatment of convective energy transport
(mixing length), opacity, and the solar abundance mixture. The

depth discretisation and the vertical extent of the models are also
slightly different, as MAFAGS-OS usually cover the range from
−6 to +2 in log τ5000 , whereas the MARCS models sample the
Rosseland optical depths from −4 to +2. Nonetheless, the thermodynamic structures of the models for the given input parameters are very similar (Bergemann et al. 2012, 2017).
The 3D model atmospheres are taken from the stagger
model atmosphere grid (Collet et al. 2011; Magic et al. 2013)
computed with the stagger code (Nordlund & Galsgaard 1995).
A 3D model consists of a series of computational boxes that represent a time series, which are referred to as snapshots. These
snapshots are selected from a larger time series of snapshots
that are produced from the stagger code and are selected at a
time when they have reached dynamical and thermal relaxation.
For our purposes – and for the sake of time – we have chosen
to work with five snapshots. Importantly, and unlike an equivalent 1D model, 3D models provide x, y, and z velocity fields
for every voxel meaning that post-processing spectrum synthesis codes provide parameter-free description of Doppler broadening, including asymmetric line profiles, which trace these gas
flows at each voxel.

Figure 6 depicts the 3D temperature structures (blue 2D histogram) in a representative snapshot for four benchmark stars,
along with the 1D MARCS (red solid line) and h3Di (dashed
gray line) profiles. The average temperature of the full 3D model
and the 1D hydrostatic model are fairly different in the outermost regions of the atmosphere, as seen by comparing the 1D
hydrostatic with the h3Di models. In particular, in the outer layers of metal-poor models the 1D hydrostatic models are significantly, up to 500 K, hotter compared to the 3D structures (see
also Bergemann et al. 2017). Also in deeper regions of the models - where the continuum usually forms - the models diverge.
This is mostly due to the treatment of convection between the
1D and 3D model atmospheres.
The average temperature structure of the 1D model of the
metal-poor RGB star HD 122563 is not very different from its
h3Di counterpart. Our adopted MARCS models are taken from
Bergemann et al. (2012, their Fig. 1). We explore the impact
of adopted 1D model in Sec. 4.4, by performing the abundance
analysis with a MAFAGS-OS suit of models. We also note that
line formation is not only sensitive to the mean T(τ) and P(τ)
structure, but also to the horizontal inhomogeneities. This star is
a particular case, where the latter play a significant role in the
abundance analysis.
The scope of this paper is limited to the analysis of a small
sample 3D models, including that of the Sun, a typical dwarf
and a typical giant (Table 2). We also include tailored 3D models computed for the parameters of the benchmark metal-poor
stars HD 122563, HD 140283, and HD 84937 (Sect. 2). To make
the NLTE radiative transfer problem computationally tractable,
we have to resample the full 3D model cubes onto a less fine, yet
equidistant, grid in horizontal coordinates. However, we test the
effect of the resolution of the cube for radiative transfer in section
4.2 and find virtually no differences in the resulting atomic number densities and line profiles for horizontal resolutions of (x,y,z)
= 30, 30, 230 and the original cubes ((x,y,z) = 240, 240, 230).
Hence, the former is taken to be the default resolution for most
of the analysis presented in this work. We solve the 3D NLTE
radiative transfer problem for a set of snapshots for each of
the 3D model atmospheres listed in Table 2. These snapshots
are extracted at regular time intervals from the full simulation
that covers roughly two convective turnover timescales (Collet
et al. 2011; Magic et al. 2013). The convergence criterion, that
is the maximum relative correction in the population numbers,

3.3. Statistical equilibrium

We use two different codes to compute the SE of Mn. One is
MULTI2.3 (Carlsson 1992), the other code is DETAIL (Butler
& Giddings 1985). The codes solve the equations of radiative
transfer and SE assuming a 1D geometry. The assumption of
trace elements is used, that is, the element that is modelled in SE
is assumed to have no effect on the model atmosphere. This is a
good assumption for Mn as it is not an electron donor nor does it
have a high impact on the overall opacity. Both codes adopt the
accelerated lambda iteration (ALI) technique and the operator
acting on the source function.
The basic differences between the codes are described in
Bergemann et al. (2012). The tests described in the following
sections will be performed imposing the same input conditions
(LTE populations) and the same model atmospheres, in order
to maximise the consistency. The main difference between the
codes are in the handling of thermodynamic parameters and of
the background opacities. In particular, DETAIL takes the partial pressures and partition functions from the input model atmosphere, whereas MULTI2.3 includes a package to compute
these parameters given the input T (τ) and Pe (τ) structures as a
function of optical depth or column mass.
In order to maximise the homogeneity of the analysis, we
have also computed background opacity tables for MULTI2.3
using the updated linelists from DETAIL (Bergemann et al.

2015). The MARCS (Gustafsson et al. 2008) and Turbospectrum
(Plez 2012) codes were used to generate a table of opacities for
a set of temperature and pressure points at more than 105 wavelengths, Mn6 lines being omitted. This table is then interpolated
by MULTI2.3 to produce detailed line background opacities.
All calculations with MULTI2.3 are carried out by solving
simultaneously the intensity at all angles, using the Feautrier
method with all scattering terms included consistently (the ISCAT option set to 1). This is important when scattering in the
background opacity is significant, as is the case in the Wien’s
regime. We have tested the line formation disabling this option,
but found that this has a very strong effect on the blue and UV
lines of Mn i and Mn ii, significantly over-estimating the line
abundances, because of reduced continuum intensities.
MULTI3D is an MPI-parallelised, domain-decomposed
NLTE radiative transfer code that solves the equations of radiative transfer in 3D geometry using the accelerated lambda
iteration (ALI) method. The formal solution of radiative transfer is done via the short characteristics method (Kunasz & Auer
1988) that solves the integral form of the radiative transfer equation across one subdomain per time step. The Carlson (1963)
quadrature A4 is employed to compute the angle-averaged radiation field in the SE solution. The approximate operator is
constructed using the formulation of Rybicki & Hummer (1991,
1992), where only the diagonal of the full Λ operator is used (for
discussion of this approximation, see, e.g. Bjørgen & Leenaarts
2017).

MULTI3D will accept three types of 3D model atmosphere
formats, including the commonly used Bifrost (Gudiksen et al.
2011) and stagger models (Magic et al. 2013). The code will
also accept any 3D model providing the temperature, density,
electron number density and x, y, and z velocity fields are supplied on a cartesian grid that is both horizontally periodic and
equidistantly spaced. The code can compute radiative transfer
using the 1.5D approximation, which treats each column of grid
points in a model as a separate plane-parallel atmosphere, or using full 3D radiative transfer. The rate equations are assumed to
be time-independent and the advection term is not included. For
more information about the code, we refer the refer to Leenaarts
et al. (2012) and Bjørgen & Leenaarts (2017).

4. Results
4.1. 1D NLTE
4.1.1. Departures from LTE

This work does not deal extensively with the properties of statistical equilibrium of Mn nor with the details of line formation, as this has been discussed in great detail in our previous
work (Bergemann & Gehren 2007). Also Bergemann & Gehren
(2008) address the details of line transfer in metal-poor stars. It
suffices to remind the reader that Mn, similar to other Fe-group
elements, is a photo-ionisation dominated ion. Simply stated, the
large photo-ioinisation cross-sections of Mn i energy levels imply significant over-ionisation in the atmospheres of cool stars
in the more general SE case compared to LTE. Mn i becomes
significantly over-ionised (compared to LTE) in metal-poor or in
hotter stellar atmospheres due to their strong UV radiation fields.
The effect of the radiation field is furthermore amplified in the
atmospheres of giants owing to their lower densities and lesser
efficiency of thermalising collisions.
This is reflected in the behaviour of Mn i level departure coefficients, bi , which describe the ratio between NLTE and LTE
atomic number densities. Departures from LTE take place in the
line formation layers. Fig. 7 shows that for Mn i, this ratio is typically . 1, as in NLTE the fraction of atoms in a given energy
state is less than that predicted by the Saha-Boltzmann formulae. The departure coefficients of the ionic levels, Mn ii, are very
close to unity for the lower-lying energy levels, but deviate from
thermal for the levels of higher excitation energy, E & 1 eV.
Figure 7 shows that the departures from NLTE in the line
formation region, −2 . log τ5000 . 0, are moderate in the solar atmosphere, but only slightly smaller than our previous estimates in Bergemann & Gehren (2007). The differences with
respect to the latter study are caused by the use of new quantummechanical photo-ionisation rates and H collision rates, as well
as the implementation of fine structure for most of the Mn i levels. Collisions with electrons are not important in the physical
conditions of the solar atmosphere. On the other hand, inelastic collisions with H atoms have a non-negligible effect on the
atomic level populations and significantly contribute to the overall thermalisation of the system. This effect is not linear and may
increase or decrease the departures from LTE for individual energy levels, and hence spectral lines, depending on the T eff , log g
and metallicity of a star.
The comparison of the bi profiles computed using DETAIL
and MULTI2.3 (Fig. 7) suggests that the codes are consistent,
given the same input conditions, such as the model atom, line
opacities, and model atmospheres. MULTI2.3 predicts slightly
larger departures from LTE compared to DETAIL. This has also
been shown in our earlier paper for Fe (Bergemann et al. 2012),
and is likely related to continuum opacities and/or the numerical
implementation of the coupled SE and radiative transfer equations.
The behaviour of departure coefficients is very different in
the model atmosphere of a metal-poor red giant star (Fig. 8).
All Mn i levels show a stronger under-population compared to
the solar model, implying larger differences between LTE and
NLTE abundances in metal-poor stars. The energy levels of the
Mn ii lines are also affected by NLTE. In particular, the levels
of the upper term z 5 Po experience overpopulation caused by the
radiative pumping in nine strong near-UV lines of Mn ii multiplet Nr. 31 (a 5 D - z 5 Po ) in the deeper layers. However, the
levels of z 5 Po become under-populated at log τ5000 ∼ −1.5, as
these lines progressively become optically thin. Consequently,

one would expect significant NLTE effects on the formation of
Mn ii lines, largely driven by the changes in the line source function itself. Comparing the departure coefficients computed using the old atom from Bergemann & Gehren (2008) (Fig. 8, top
panel) and the new atom in this work (Fig. 8, middle panel),
we find substantial differences. The influence of new quantummechanical collisions with hydrogen is admittedly greater in the
new atom, despite the larger photo-ionisation cross-sections. On
the other hand, contrasting the results obtained with the DETAIL
code with MULTI2.3 (Fig. 8, middle and bottom panels) confirms that, similar to the Sun (Fig. 7), the two codes produce
quantitatively similar outputs. In the outer layers, the departures
are slightly different that could be related to the differences in
the outer boundary conditions.
4.1.2. NLTE abundance corrections

A NLTE abundance correction is the quantity that is commonly
used in stellar abundance studies to correct the abundances derived under the assumption of LTE. The abundance correction
are defined as ∆ = A(NLTE) − A(LTE), i.e., the difference in
abundance required to fit a given spectral line assuming 1D LTE
or 1D NLTE. We also employ this concept in our 3D NLTE analysis in Sec. 4.2.
Figure 9 illustrates the NLTE abundance correction for several metal-poor models in the metallicity range −3 to 0. We only
plot selected lines to illustrate the key results: the 3488 Å line
of Mn ii, multiplet 4 (4030, 4033, 4034 Å), multiplet 18 (4783,
4823 Å), and multiplet 32 (6013, 6016, 6021 Å) of Mn i. The
behaviour of abundance corrections within a given multiplet is
very similar, hence the lines are grouped by multiplets. The correction is not tailored to any particular star and is computed assuming the reference NLTE [Mn/Fe] of zero. We also explored
the abundance corrections computed using LTE [Mn/Fe] abundance of −0.5 to −0.8, as it would be typically measured assuming LTE in metal-poor stars and found no significant differences
in the corrections. The individual curves represent three possible
scenarios, which differ in the completeness of the model atom.
In Figure 9, we illustrate the sensitivity of the corrections
to the quantum-mechanical H data. The CH case corresponds
to the model atom, which is devoid of quantum-mechanical H
collisional excitation processes (but including charge transfer).
The CH0 model lacks the charge transfer processes, but includes
the collisional excitation. These two cases are compared to the
model, which has both excitation and charge transfer (CH/CH0
included). None of the three cases presented in this figure includes the Kaulakys (1985) collision rates.
The H collisions clearly have a different impact on the line
formation in the atmospheres of giants and dwarfs. Based on the
NLTE abundance corrections in the figures, it appears that for
dwarfs, H collisions serve as a thermalising agent, decreasing
the difference between NLTE and LTE. In the atmospheres of
red giants, the effect is somewhat counter-intuitive: the lines of
multiplet 32 (6013-6021 Å triplet) have smaller NLTE corrections, when H collisions are excluded. In fact, this is the indirect
effect of over-ionisation, which is more efficiently transferred to
higher-excitation states by collisions with H. On the other hand,
the lines of multiplet 18 (4783, 4823Å) behave as expected from
the simple considerations of increased rate of collisional thermalisation. Fig. 9 also suggests that charge transfer (CT) reactions are more important in the atmospheres of dwarfs. Neglecting CT fully typically leads to abundance corrections overestimated by 0.05 dex for the models with [Fe/H] ' −3.

Figure 10 illustrates the influence of collision rates computed using the Kaulakys (1985) recipe. The reference atom includes the Kaulakys (1985) collisions in addition to the data from
Belyaev et al. (2017), and we compare this model with the model
that is devoid of the Kaulakys data. The differences with our
reference model atom are modest, and do not exceed 0.05 dex
for the dominant part of the parameter space. The effects that
are possibly most significant occur when we neglect Kaulakys
(1985) collisions. This leads to slightly over-estimated NLTE
abundance corrections for the multiplet 32 Mn i lines (6013 6021 Å triplet) in the RGB models. On the other hand, the NLTE
abundance corrections for these very high-excitation lines are
systematically under-estimated in the model of a dwarf.
The general picture is that the NLTE abundance corrections
for the Mn i lines are positive and increase with decreasing
metallicity, supporting our earlier study of Mn (Bergemann &
Gehren 2007, 2008) and of other similar ions (e.g. Fe, Bergemann et al. 2012; Lind et al. 2012). The corrections are slightly
larger for the RGB model, especially at lower [Fe/H]. The
higher-excitation lines, such as those of multiplets 18 and 32 are
more sensitive to NLTE. Their NLTE abundance corrections typically increase with decreasing metallicity, but this trend slightly
flattens below [Fe/H] ∼ −2. Another noteworthy feature of these
diagrams is that fact that the Mn ii lines are also not immune to
NLTE. It has been often assumed in the literature that the lines
of ionic species do not show NLTE effects. The few strong excited lines of Mn ii at 1.85 eV show the classical NLTE effect of
photon loss. This effect is small, but shows in the atmospheres
of dwarfs and giants (Fig. 10). It implies that lower abundances

would be obtained from Mn ii line especially for the metal-poor
stars with [Fe/H] = −2. At lower metallicity, the Mn ii lines become weak enough and radiative pumping effects dominate that
leads to positive NLTE abundance corrections.
It is interesting, and it possibly presents the main difference
with respect to our earlier study, that the strong resonance triplet
of Mn i at 4030-4034 Å and the excited lines show very similar
NLTE abundance corrections. The NLTE corrections exceed just
about 0.4 dex in the atmospheres of RGB stars with [Fe/H] = −3.
This is important, as LTE abundances derived from the resonance Mn i lines are known to be significantly lower compared
to high-excitation Mn i features (Bonifacio et al. 2009; Sneden
et al. 2016). In the 1D NLTE analysis, there is no room for differentially larger NLTE corrections for the 4030-4034 Å triplet
lines, compared to the high-excitation features. In our previous
work, a higher degree of over-ionisation in Mn i, and, in particular, over-ionisation from the ground state, was achieved by
employing a tailored S H scaling factor to the Drawin collisional
(excitation and ionisation) Mn I + H I rates. As a consequence,
the NLTE abundance corrections for the resonance triplet lines
were significantly higher.
Below we show that 3D NLTE calculations suggest substantial differential effects between Mn i lines of different excitation
potential, which help to improve the excitation balance (Sect.
4.2), effectively providing the physical basis for the effect, which
is mimicked by using inefficient H collisions in 1D models.

4.2. 3D NLTE

We begin the 3D NLTE analysis with a brief account of line formation in 3D inhomogeneous atmospheres, with the emphasis
on the solar model. This is useful in order to understand the key
differences between 1D and 3D abundances that will be the subject of Sections 4.2.3 and 4.4.
Section 4.2.1 will deal with the properties of line formation
in full 3D solar simulation cubes, that we refer to as photon kinematics. In Section 4.2.2, we discuss simplified radiative transfer
models and explore how these impact the line profiles compared
to the full 3D NLTE solution. The results of the 3D NLTE solar abundance analysis are presented in Section 4.2.3. In Section
4.2.4, we discuss the impact of 3D NLTE on the line profiles,
their equivalent widths (EW), and on the abundance diagnostic
for four metal-poor models and compare them with the results of
LTE and NLTE calculations with 1D hydrostatic models, as well
as with the predictions of 3D LTE models. Finally, in section 4.4,
we use 3D convective models of the benchmark metal-poor stars
HD 84937, HD 140383, and HD 122563 to derive 3D NLTE
abundances.
4.2.1. Photon kinematics

Figure 11 illustrates spatially-resolved NLTE intensity profiles
of two Mn i lines in the solar model at the disk centre. All profiles are normalised to the average continuum intensity for the
corresponding spectral line in the snapshot. The lines were chosen such that the effect of the HFS is minimal, in order to isolate
the effect of granular motions on the profiles. The profiles are
taken for every fourth point along each horizontal coordinate in

the simulation domain (i.e. for 8 × 8 = 64 points out of 900),
to not overload the figure. The bisectors for each line component
are shown in the right-hand side panels. In addition, the solid red
and blue curves indicate the profiles extracted from the granule,
respectively, inter-granular lane, which are marked with red and
blue boxes in Fig. 12.
Overall, the behaviour of the lines is very similar to that described earlier by Dravins & Nordlund (1990b, e.g. their Fig.
6 for a Sun-like star α Cen A). The weaker high-excitation
Mn i line at 5004 Å shows a strong anti-correlation between the
depth of the line core and the line shift (the right-hand panel).
This is, in fact, the weakest unblended solar Mn i line with the
EW of only 13 mÅ. The line profiles with the strongest blue-shift
and the highest intensity contrast form above the granules, where
the upwards streaming motions of hotter material are characterised by higher velocities, and higher granular temperatures
account for the brighter background continuum. The dominant
non-LTE effect of over-ionisation leads to the brightening in the
line core. The lack of any pronounced curvature in the bisectors
of the blue-shifted components suggests that there is little vertical variation of velocity field in the upflows.
The Mn i line at 4502 Å, which is stronger but has the same
lower excitation potential as the 5004 Å line, also shows a very
broad distribution of line shifts. This line is close to saturation,
as is evidenced by the broad rectangular inner core in the bluest
components. Similar to the 5004 line, the bisectors of the blueshifted components, which form above granules, are typically lshaped, i.e., the line profiles are nearly symmetric. Although the
blue-shifted components are very strong, and are characterised
by very extended (vertically) line formation regions, this again
suggests that the vertical variation of velocity fields in the granArticle number, page 11 of 31

ules is small. On the other hand, the bisectors of the profiles that
are forming above the inter-granular lanes tend to approximate
a c-shape. These line components are highly asymmetric, their
cores are very broad, and tend be skewed to the red. Dravins &
Nordlund (1990b) found that this is a characteristic feature of the
lines that form across inter-granular regions with a larger vertical
velocity gradient with depth.

4.2.2. 3D test cases

Calculations of 3D NLTE radiative transfer are very computationally expensive. Hence, we explored whether a simplified
treatment of NLTE radiative transfer with 3D simulations offers
a suitable alternative to full 3D NLTE calculations.
In particular, we illustrate and discuss the results of calculations obtained using more compact model atmosphere cubes and
different radiative transfer solvers (1.5D versus full 3D). We also
compare the flux profiles obtained using different solar snapshots. In what follows, we limit the discussion to two Mn i lines
only. One of them is a strong resonance line at 5394 Å, where
the effects of NLTE and 3D convection are most pronounced.
The second line is that at 4502 Å, discussed in the previous section. This line is least affected by the HFS, hence its shape is a

good test case to explore the effects of NLTE and 3D convective
flows.
Figure 13 (top left panel) illustrates the impact of the radiative transfer solver, full 3D NLTE vs 1.5D, that is, column-bycolumn solution, ignoring non-vertical radiative transfer, using
the reference model atom. The difference is negligible and it
amounts to less than 0.5% in the flux level, or < 0.01 dex in
abundance, that is far less than the uncertainty incurred by the
other sources of error. In the case of metal-poor stars, the differences are also modest and do not exceed a few percent in
EW. Since the computational time of 3D NLTE scales as O(n4/3 ),
where n is the number of grid points, that is the number of iterations is proportional to the number of grid points in the z direction, it is a reasonable approximation to use 1.5D NLTE calculations, at least for the stars with parameters not too different from
the models tested in this work.
Figure 13 (top right panel) illustrates the impact of the model
atmosphere resolution. We employ three models: one resampled
to the resolution of 5x5x102, the other with the resolution of
30x30x230 (our default resolution), as well as the maximum
resolution of 100x100x230 that we can afford with the computing time available to us. The comparison of the medium- and
maximum resolution simulation can be found in the Appendix.
The effects are visible in the line profiles, but they only slightly
change the shape of the line and have a very modest effect on

Bergemann et al.: Mn

are driven by strong non-local radiation field across multiple ionisation channels of the ion in the UV and in the optical. Of all
Mn i lines, the resonance lines at 5394 and 5432 Å are most sensitive to this effect, as the lines are comparatively weak in the
solar spectrum, and their NLTE effect is mainly caused by the
change in the line opacity that scales in the first order as the ratio
of the NLTE to LTE number densities of the lower energy level
of the transition. The higher-excitation lines, such as that at 4502
Å show more modest NLTE effects in the model atmosphere of
the Sun, both in 1D and in 3D.
The results of our test calculations indicate that vertical radiative transfer in NLTE with full 3D data cubes at the resolution of (x,y,z) = 30, 30, 230 is the most suitable approach and we
employ this method in our calculations of Mn abundances for
the Sun (Sect. 4.2.3) and the benchmark stars (Sect. 4.4). The
approach allows affordable 3D NLTE calculations within reasonable timescales and provides line profiles consistent with the
original resolution of the 3D cubes, as well as, with the full 3D
radiative transfer calculations.
4.2.3. Solar Mn abundance

the line equivalent width. This effect comes mostly through the
impact of velocities on the line opacity, κ(x, ν · (1 − ν(x)/c)) as
is best seen in the lines, which are not very sensitive to HFS,
such as the 4502 Å line (left panel in Fig. 13). Their shapes are
closely approximated by a Gaussian, and the effects of velocity
fields are easily distinguished. In particular, the red wing of the
line appears to be slightly skewed, i.e. darker, in the model with
higher resolution. There is also an implicit effect of velocities
on the line source function, as it depends on the radiation field
at the line frequencies, which is non-local and connected to the
velocity distribution at all spatial points along the beam.
We also find (Fig. 13, bottom left panel) that the flux profiles
computed using different (regularly-spaced in time) snapshots
do not show significant variations. The 5394 Å line changes its
depth by ∼ 3%. The position of the line centre changes by a few
mÅ. The 4502 Å line is almost insensitive to the temporal effects.
This suggests that the statistical properties of velocity fields,
temperature, and pressure inhomogeneities in each snapshot are
representative of some average distribution values for the relaxed
simulation given the values of T eff , log g, and [Fe/H]. The temporal variability of spatially resolved profiles has been examined in detail in Dravins (1990); Dravins & Nordlund (1990a,
their Sect.5). They found that the characteristic evolution of line
shapes and depths lacks a unique timescale, that was a manifestation of the lack of a unique scale in the spatial power spectra.
Hence, the ensemble averages of spatially resolved line profiles
are very similar in different snapshots, as we will also demonstrate in Sect. 4.2.4 for other models.
Finally, Fig. 13 (bottom right panel) illustrates the line profiles computed with 1D LTE and 3D NLTE. This is a major
difference that amounts up to 0.2 dex in the abundance (see
next section). Similar to the earlier studies for ions with similarly complex electronic structure and ionisation potential (e.g.
Amarsi et al. 2016; Lind et al. 2017, for Fe I), we find that the
effects of 3D NLTE are to weaken the line compared to 1D LTE.
Mn i is a photoionisation-dominated ion, that is the NLTE effects

The Sun is a metal-rich star, and as such, the spectral lines in
most cases appear to suffer from blending and/or strong sensitivity to damping or turbulence. As a matter of fact, most Mn i lines
are not very useful, being either blended or too strong, with a
few exceptions. Nonetheless, we start with the analysis of all
Mn i lines that are typically used in the analysis of FGK stars,
and later assume a more conservative approach that takes into
account only the most reliable features.
The LTE analysis of the solar Mn i lines is carried out using
the SIU spectrum synthesis code (Reetz 1999). SIU allows interactive spectral fitting, which is very convenient to test for the
presence and effects of blends and asymmetries within a line.
This is a very accurate approach, especially when applied to
ultra-high-resolution spectra, such as the solar atlases, and has
been commonly exploited in the literature.
Figure 14 presents some examples of 3D NLTE line profiles
for the solar spectrum. Note that in this plot, we have not adjusted the Mn abundances, but assumed the abundance of 5.47
dex, as recommended by earlier studies of the solar Mn abundance. Most of the Mn i lines are very broad, with the width of
0.2 − 0.3 Å, which is the consequence of the HFS. It is obvious
that the available atomic and HFS data describe the line profiles remarkably well, both in terms of the asymmetries and the
multi-component structure. The latter is particularly prominent
in the cores of the weak resonance or ground-state lines, such
as the 5394 and 5516 Å line. The core of the line at 5420 Å is
slightly too weak, compared with the observations. This could
be due to its sensitivity to activity (Wise et al. 2018). Note that
also the 5394, 5432 and 6013 lines could be affected (Wise et al.
2018), and in particular, the 5394 Å line has a long history of research owing to its variation with the global solar activity cycle
(Danilovic & Vince 2005; Livingston et al. 2007). Some studies
suggest that the line is not as sensitive to granular motions as
other features, because of its wide HFS, and is more sensitive
to the intergranular magnetic concentrations, similar to the CH
G-band Vitas et al. (2009). According to our 3D NLTE results,
however, the 5394 Å line is sensitive to convection and shows
a significant difference between modelling with 1D hydrostatic
and 3D convective models. Overall, the agreement of the model
3D NLTE line profiles with the observed solar data suggests that

els are sufficient to satisfactorily describe the properties of Mn
lines in the solar spectrum.
The abundances determined from the Mn i lines that we view
as reliable photospheric abundance diagnostics are shown in Figure 15. The major challenge in the analysis of the solar spectrum is the contamination of line profiles by blends. These are
present in the wings of the strong Mn i lines, such as the 4761
Å, 4762 Å, 4765 Å, 4766 Å, but also the lines of multiplet 18
(4783 and 4823 Å). Besides, there are no quantum-mechanical
data for elastic collisions with H atoms for the two latter lines
(Barklem et al. 2000), hence, we have to resort to the standard
Unsöld formalism that carries an additional source of an uncertainty. We disregard such lines when computing the solar abundance of Mn. The 1D NLTE and 3D NLTE Mn abundances are
derived by applying the corrections computed using MULTI2.3
and MULTI3D for the individual spectral lines.
In 1D LTE, the low-excitation potential and/or very strong
lines give a lower abundance of Mn compared to the high-EP
(weaker) lines. The difference is not large, but significant given
the very quality of the observed data and well-constrained fundamental parameters of the Sun. The effects on NLTE in the solar atmosphere are moderate and change the average solar abundance by only ∼ 0.02 to 0.07 dex. NLTE alone does not help to
improve the solar excitation balance. More important is the combined influence of convection and NLTE. In the case of NLTE
calculations with the 3D convective solar model, the effect of
Article number, page 14 of 31

over-ionisation is amplified owing to stronger background radiation fields in the granules. The 3D NLTE - 1D LTE difference
is equivalent to ∼ 0.22 dex in abundance for the resonance lines,
but 0.15 dex for the higher excitation lines of other multiplets.
Our solar abundances of Mn are 5.34 ± 0.04 dex in LTE,
5.41 ± 0.05 dex in NLTE, and 5.52 ± 0.04 in 3D NLTE. The 1D
NLTE and 3D NLTE values are consistent with the meteoritic
abundance of Mn 5.50 ± 0.03 dex reported by Lodders (2003).
Our 1D LTE result is ∼ 0.1 dex higher compared to the previous
estimate reported in Bergemann & Gehren (2007), 5.23 ± 0.1
dex. On the other hand, it matches very well our LTE estimate
obtained using the MAFAGS solar model, the revised transition
probabilities, and the SIU spectrum synthesis code in BlackwellWhitehead & Bergemann (2007), 5.33 ± 0.1 dex. The new 1D
NLTE values are also higher than the estimates in Bergemann &
Gehren (2007). In both cases, 1D LTE and 1D NLTE, the difference is due to the revision of the transition probabilities and the
NLTE model atom.
4.2.4. 3D NLTE effects in metal-poor model atmospheres

Our analysis of line formation with 1D models suggests that the
majority of Mn lines are sensitive to NLTE. Also the calculations
for the 3D hydrodynamical model of the Sun indicate a strong
impact of convection on the line profiles, which does not cancel

the NLTE effects, but rather amplifies them for the most spectral
features of Mn i.
In this section, we present the analysis of line formation in
several model atmospheres of metal-poor stars. We explore the
models with parameters with T eff = 6500 K, log g = 4 dex,
[Fe/H] = −1 and T eff = 4500 K, log g = 2, [Fe/H] = −1, as well
as their metal-poor counterparts with [Fe/H] = −2. For simplicity and didactic clarity, all calculations are performed assuming
a scaled solar Mn abundance. Deviations from this assumption
may affect the line formation, yet at this stage we are interested
in the combined effects of 3D radiative transfer in convective
models and NLTE and the impact on Mn i lines with different
properties. We explore which lines are least sensitive to these effects, and employ them in the abundance analysis in the followup study of a larger stellar sample.
Our results for the four 3D models are illustrated in Fig. 16.
We also overplot the predictions of 1D LTE modelling computed using the same Mn model atom and the same Mn abun-

dance. Similar to the solar model, the 3D NLTE line profiles are
much weaker than the 1D LTE counterparts. This is the consequence of over-ionisation, which is stronger in metal-poor conditions due to reduced line blanketing and stronger UV radiation fluxes. The topology of convection in FGK stars is set by
mass conservation. The hotter rising granules occupy the dominant (∼ 2/3) part of the stellar surface, whereas the cooler downdrafts are confined to narrow inter-granular lanes (Stein & Nordlund 1989; Nordlund et al. 2009), although the area subtended
by the down-flows increases with depth. Hence, over-ionisation
in the granules is the dominant NLTE effect that defines the appearance of the spatially-integrated line profiles. In contrast to
the Sun, where the effects of convective shifts were marginal,
the integrated flux profiles in the metal-poor models show strong
asymmetries, with typical blue-shifted cores and skewed wings.
This is best seen by comparing the symmetric 1D profiles, convolved with an arbitrary macro-turbulence and the 3D profiles,
which do not assume any ad-hoc broadening. Also the line proArticle number, page 15 of 31

files from individual snapshots are remarkably similar to their
temporarily-averaged counterparts, although a slightly more pronounced temporal variation is seen in the NLTE line profiles
computed using the 3D models of dwarfs (Fig. 16).
The differences between 1D LTE and 3D NLTE profiles are
very large, with only a few notable exceptions. These exceptions
are the blue lines of Mn ii, such as the 3488 Å and 3497 Å lines.
For dwarfs, these low-excitation Mn ii features are nearly invariant to the changes in the model atmosphere structure, and they
indeed show very similar line shapes and equivalent widths, regardless of whether one adopts LTE or NLTE radiative transfer. Also a standard choice of the micro-turbulence ξt = 1 km/s
appears to be satisfactory for a dwarf model, producing a line
profile, which closely resembles the full 3D NLTE profile of the
Mn ii 3488 Å line even in the model with [Fe/H] = −2. For the
computational complexity of 3D NLTE modelling, we are unable to explore a larger parameter space of 3D models in this
work, but the behaviour of the models with metallicity suggests
that this conclusion may hold also for other stars on the mainsequence, as long as [Fe/H] is not in the extremely metal-poor
domain.
Article number, page 16 of 31

Yet, this fortunate result does not hold for the atmospheres
of giants, neither does it generally hold for the Mn i lines. The
3488 Å line of Mn ii suffers from non-negligible deviations from
NLTE in the RGB models, being significantly stronger in 3D
NLTE. On the other hand, the 3D NLTE abundances of all lines
of Mn i are significantly higher compared to 1D LTE. This is
best illustrated by exploring the differences between 1D LTE and
3D NLTE, respectively, 1D NLTE and 3D NLTE abundances,
derived from the line of a given equivalent width. This quantity
is typically referred to as a 3D NLTE abundance correction (3D
NLTE - 1D LTE).
Figure 18 (top panel) shows that the 3D NLTE abundance
corrections amount to 0.25 dex for most Mn i lines in the atmospheres of dwarfs, but in the models of RGB stars the (3D NLTE
- 1D LTE) abundance differences tend to be significantly larger.
In all cases, 1D analysis tends to substantially under-estimate the
Mn abundance. In particular, for the lines of multiples 18 and 32
(e.g. 4823 and 6016 Å) we find the abundance corrections of
0.3 to 0.4 dex in metal-poor models, whereas the blue resonance
lines at 4030-4034 Å show even larger 3D NLTE corrections of
∼ 0.5 dex at [Fe/H] = −2. This is a very interesting result. On
the one hand, our results suggest that the large abundance discrepancies and excitation imbalance seen in the analysis of RGB
stars (Bonifacio et al. 2009) may indeed be accounted for by 3D
NLTE. On the other hand, we also find that 3D NLTE effects
do not significantly impact the excitation balance in the atmospheres of very metal-poor dwarfs, as 3D NLTE corrections are
similar for the lines of all Mn i multiplets. This is why this effect may go un-detected in 1D LTE studies of stars with similar
parameters (e.g the study of HD 84937 by Sneden et al. 2016,
or Mishenina et al. 2015). Also the 3D NLTE corrections for
the Mn ii lines are very small in the metal-poor atmospheres of
dwarfs, and do not exceed −0.05 dex at [Fe/H] = −2.
Figure 18 also suggests that, whereas 1D LTE always
under-estimates abundances for the Mn i lines, there are a few
Mn i lines that can be reliably modelled with 1D NLTE. These
are the lines of multiplets 9 (e.g. 4055, 4070, 4082 Å), 23 (4761,
4762, 4765, 4766 Å), 24 (e.g. 4436, 4451, 4498, 4502 Å), and
32 (6013, 6016, 6021 Å). For these features, the differences between 1D NLTE and 3D NLTE are marginal, and do not exceed
0.1 dex in the lowest-metallicity ([Fe/H] =−2) models of both
dwarf and RGB stars. The lines of other multiplets show a very
significant systematic deviations from 1D NLTE, caused by the
impact of convective inhomogeneities. Also for dwarfs, the impact of convection is modest and indeed, most optical Mn i lines,
including the resonance Mn i triplet at 403 nm, would be suitable for abundance diagnostic, leading to a modest bias of ∼+0.05
−0.15
dex. The exact value would also depend on the abundance of Mn
itself, but also on the assumed value of micro-turbulence in the
1D models, so our estimates of 3D NLTE abundance corrections
may not be directly applicable to the 1D LTE measurements in
the observed stars. Rather we recommend to employ those lines,
which according to out tests, show minimal impact of convection
and/or NLTE.
The IR lines of Mn i, e.g. those that are used in the H-band
abundance analysis (Shetrone et al. 2015), show significant departures from 1D and LTE. However, it is remarkable that all
three Mn lines that we tested in this work are extremely consistent what concerns the 1D NLTE-3D NLTE differences in dwarf
and RGB models. In effect, the abundances for all these models
are systematically under-estimated by −0.15 dex with respect to
1D NLTE, and the bias appears to be insensitive to metallicity of
the model. It, hence, appears reasonable to apply a positive cor-

profile. The Mn i lines at 4766 and 6021 Å are slightly shallower
in 3D LTE compared to 1D LTE, but deeper for the 4823 Å line.
On other hand, all lines of Mn i are much fainter in 3D NLTE
compared to 3D LTE, suggesting that a 3D LTE analysis would
strongly under-estimate the Mn abundances.

Mn i lines compared to 3D NLTE. The UV Mn ii line at 3488 Å
shows very small NLTE effects in the metal-poor RGB model, in
fact, its 3D LTE and 3D NLTE profiles are very similar. On the
other hand, the 1D LTE assumption under-estimates the strength
of the Mn ii line, hence, over-estimating Mn abundance derived
from this feature.

Fig. 18. 3D NLTE abundance corrections for selected models.

This tendency is qualitatively very similar in the dwarf model
at [Fe/H] = −2. One notable exception is that the resonance line
at 4034 Å is now exceptionally strong in 3D LTE, much stronger
than the profiles computed using 1D LTE and 3D NLTE, the
behaviour that is known also for other chemical species. The
major implication of this is that 3D LTE modelling is unlikely
to solve the excitation imbalance in Mn, which is well-known
from 1D LTE studies (e.g. Bonifacio et al. 2009; Sneden et al.
2016). The unfortunate problem is that even in 1D LTE the resonance Mn i lines yield significantly lower abundances, relative
to their higher excitation counterparts. The 3D LTE line profiles of the resonance lines are stronger than their 1D LTE counterparts computed assuming the same Mn abundance, meaning
that the 3D LTE abundances of these lines must be reduced to
recover the correct equivalent width. For the higher-excitation
lines, the differences between 1D and 3D LTE at [Fe/H] = −2
are not large, because the lines are very weak, and form deep in
the atmosphere, at log τ5000 > −2, where the temperature inhomogeneities are not pronounced and the average structure of the
1D hydrostatic models closely resembles that of 3D models (see,
e.g. Fig.6).
The behaviour is very similar in the 3D models of giants.
3D LTE line profiles are not too different from 1D LTE at [Fe/H]
= −1, modulo the modest effect of convection on the line shapes,
but they are always stronger compared to 3D NLTE. The differences are exacerbated at low metallicity, [Fe/H]= −2, where
3D LTE calculations greately over-estimate the strength of all

The Mn abundances in the stellar spectra were computed by
matching the observed equivalent widths to the grids of 1D LTE
and 1D NLTE spectral lines computed using MULTI2.3. The
equivalent widths were measured from the UVES-POP spectra of these stars using the SIU code. Unlike in our analysis
of the Sun, we have chosen to not employ SIU for abundance
measurements in metal-poor stars, as blending is not a problem
anymore and a detailed spectrum synthesis is unnecessary. Also
MULTI2.3 has an advantage in that it includes background scattering, which is essential for the blue and UV lines. 3D NLTE
corrections were computed separately and applied to the 1D LTE
abundances derived using the measured EWs.
The results for all three benchmark metal-poor stars are
shown in Fig. 19. The error bars correspond to the uncertainties of the EW measurements. We show the abundances derived
using the MAFAGS-OS models (left panels) and the MARCS
models (right panels) in order to illustrate the impact of the 1D
model atmospheres. Overall, the results obtained MAFAGS-OS
and MARCS models are in agreement, especially for the model
of the metal-poor RGB star HD 122563. The differences can
generally be explained by the small differences in the input parameters of the models. In particular, the MAFAGS-OS models
assume the following parameters: (a) HD 122563: T eff = 4600
K, log g = 1.60 dex, [Fe/H] = −2.5 dex, (b) HD 140283:
T eff = 5773 K, log g = 3.66 dex, [Fe/H] = −2.38 dex, and (c)
HD 84937: T eff = 6350 K, log g = 4.09 dex, [Fe/H] = −2.15
dex, which can be compared to Table 2. This is most likely at
the origin of the somewhat lower abundances that we get for HD
84937. It is also noteworthy that MARCS models lead to slightly
more consistent abundances from Mn i lines for all three reference stars.
Regardless of the choice of 1D models, 1D LTE modelling
reveals a significant ionisation imbalance, in that the Mn i lines
give systematically lower abundances compared to Mn ii lines,
confirming the results reported in the literature (Johnson 2002).
The difference is most pronounced for the RGB star HD 122563,
for which the offset is close to 0.7 dex. We also confirm the
Mn i excitation imbalance in all three stars, with strong resonance lines of Mn i producing systematically lower abundances
compared to higher excitation lines. For HD 122563, the offset
between the lines of multiplet 4 (the 4030-4034 Å triplet) and
the lines of other multiplets is ∼ 0.2 dex, whereas for the subgiant HD 140283 and turn-off star HD 84937 the offset is slightly
larger, of the order ∼ 0.3 dex.
The ionisation balance is significantly improved for all three
stars in 1D NLTE. In particular, for HD 84937 and HD 140283,
the abundances derived from the high-excitation lines are now
consistent with the abundances derived from the Mn ii lines. For
HD 122563, the ionisation balance in 1D NLTE is only partially
improved, but there is still a differential effect of −0.2 dex for the
high-excitation lines and −0.5 dex for the low-excitation lines.
The improvement is most striking in 3D NLTE. The 3D
NLTE abundance corrections are very large and positive for
both ionisation stages. For HD 122563, this brings Mn i and

Mn ii lines into agreement. For HD 84937 and HD 140283, the
3D NLTE abundances are higher compared to 1D NLTE, however, the differential effect is not as large. It should be emphasised that stellar parameters of these three stars are wellconstrained by independent methods, and the fact that ionisation

rameters, like micro-turbulence in 1D, is remarkable. For comparison, to explain the ionisation imbalance in HD122563 by the
error in stellar parameters, its T eff would have to be increased
to 4900 K (that would bring the resonance lines up by ∼ +0.7
dex to be consistent with Mn ii), or alternatively the ξt increased
to 3.5 km/s dex that would push the Mn ii abundances down

Bergemann et al.: Mn

by ∼ −0.7 dex. Decreasing the log g might help to increase the
abundance from the resonance lines, but a change to log g < 0.5
would be necessary. All these changes in stellar parameters can
be ruled out, given the robust constraints from asteroseismology
and interferometry (Creevey et al. 2012; Karovicova et al. 2018;
Creevey et al. 2019). Also micro-turbulence, despite being a free
parameter, is relatively well-constrained in the literature (Bergemann et al. 2012; Afşar et al. 2016).
HD 84937 was recently analysed employing 1D LTE models by Sneden et al. (2016). They adopted somewhat different
stellar parameters for this metal-poor turn-off star: T eff = 6300
K, log g = 4.0, [Fe/H] = −2.15, and ξt = 1.5 km/s. Their estimates of [Mn/Fe] for this star are ∼ −0.25 for the Mn II lines and
∼ −0.3 for the Mn I lines (their Fig. 7). On the other hand, they
also tabulate the abundances derived by taking the ratios of the
elements derived from the lines in the same ionisation stage (e.g.
Mn I to Fe I and Mn II to Fe II). In the latter case, their values
are −0.42 for the Mn II lines and −0.46 for the Mn I lines (their
Table 5).
Our 1D LTE estimates for HD 84937 are [Mn/Fe] = −0.24
dex, as derived from the Mn ii lines, and [Mn/Fe] = −0.47
dex for the high-excitation Mn i lines. Similar to Sneden et al.,
we find that the Mn i triplet lines give the abundance that are
∼ 0.2 dex lower compared to the high-excitation lines. Our abundances derived from the Mn I lines may appear to be lower,
but this is likely the consequence of the adopted metallicity.
Indeed, we adopt [Fe/H] = −2.0 dex in this work, consistent with our < 3D > NLTE estimate in Bergemann et al.
(2012)([Fe/H] = −2.04 to −1.95 dex, depending on the choice of
the H scaling factor), which was recently confirmed from the full
3D NLTE Fe analysis by Amarsi et al. (2016), who find [Fe/H]
= −1.96 ± 0.02(stat) ± 0.04(sys) dex. On the other hand, Sneden
et al. (2016) adopt a very low metallicity, [Fe/H] = −2.15 dex,
that leads to significantly higher Mn abundances. It is not clear
which of the estimates from Sneden et al. (2016) are to be given
preference and which of their both methodological approaches
is more consistent with our estimate. Different from that study,
we do not consider lines with EWs . 3 mÅ in the UVES spectrum of HD 84937 as reliable, such as the lines at 4762,4765,
4766 Å, and the red triplet at 6013-6021 Å. This, combined
with the choice of the atmospheric models, stellar parameters,
and the methods to determine the abundances, may account for
the somewhat different results in our study and in Sneden et al.
(2016).

5. Conclusions
We present the first 3D NLTE analysis of Mn line formation
in inhomogeneous model atmospheres. We employ 3 different statistical equilibrium codes, two of them compute radiative transfer in 1D geometry (MULTI2.3 and DETAIL), whereas
MULTI3D is used for detailed 3D NLTE calculations.
The NLTE model atom is assembled using the new atomic
data for different processes. We use the R-matrix method to
compute new photo-ionisation cross-sections for 84 terms of
Mn i, and employ them in place of hydrogenic cross-sections.
We also compute new collision rates for 71 terms of Mn I interacting with H and the for the first excited state of Mn ii interacting with H. The latter are supplemented with the data for 19
Mn i levels and the ground state of Mn ii presented by Belyaev
& Voronov (2017). We also implement the collision rates computed using the scattering-length approximation according to
Kaulakys (1985); Barklem (2016). The new photo-ionisation

cross-sections and the new rates of inelastic collisions represent
the main difference with respect to our earlier results.
We confirm the earlier studies (Bergemann & Gehren 2007,
2008) that the NLTE effects in Mn i are driven by over-ionisation.
The qualitative behaviour of the departure coefficients and the
NLTE abundance corrections is very similar. All Mn i lines in
the optical suffer from strong NLTE effects and display positive NLTE abundance corrections, which increase with decreasing metallicity of the model atmosphere. LTE modelling underestimates Mn abundances, by ∼ −0.5 dex in the models of metalpoor red giants, and to a lesser degree in the models of dwarfs.
The NLTE abundance corrections are sensitive to the implementation of collision rates that affects the results at the level of ∼ 0.1
dex. Different from Bergemann & Gehren (2008), we find that
the new model does not produce large NLTE effects for the resonance lines of Mn i. We attribute this to the use of a tailored
ad-hoc scaling factor to collisions in the previous study, that,
however produced qualitatively similar results to our 3D NLTE
calculations.
Our 3D modelling of solar Mn lines reveals unique features of line formation in the convective models, known from
the previous studies (e.g. Dravins et al. 1981; Dravins 1987;
Dravins & Nordlund 1990b,a; Nordlund & Dravins 1990). The
spatially-resolved Mn lines show pronounced asymmetries. For
the weaker lines, we find a strong anti-correlation between the
line core depth and the line shift. The strong lines show a very
broad distribution of line shifts, associated with granular motions. The bluer components are rather symmetric, but red components of the spatially-resolved features are very asymmetric
and broad, tracing the differences in the line formation in the
granules and in the inter-granular lanes.
We perform 1D LTE, 3D LTE, 1D NLTE, and 3D NLTE calculations for a large set of Mn lines, including the Mn ii UV lines,
but also the commonly-used optical lines, and the IR Mn i lines
in the H-band. We find large differences between the four scenarios, which can be broadly summarised as follows:
– All lines of Mn i are significantly weaker in 3D NLTE,
compared to 1D LTE. As a consequence, 1D LTE underestimates the Mn abundances by ∼ −0.6 dex for the blue
resonance Mn i lines, but −0.4 dex for the optical lines in the
RGB models with [Fe/H] = −2. The effect is smaller for the
models of dwarfs: the systematic bias incurred by 1D LTE is
∼ −0.2 dex and does not change substantially with [Fe/H].
– The commonly-used blue lines of Mn ii at 3488 and 3497
Å are typically too weak in 1D LTE and 1D NLTE calculations, compared to 3D NLTE modelling. This effect is caused
by the significant line scattering, and is greately amplified in
the 3D inhomogeneous model atmospheres. Hence, 1D LTE
and 1D NLTE typically over-estimate Mn abundance derived
from the Mn ii 3488 and 3497 Å lines. 3D NLTE effects depend strongly on the atmospheric parameters of a star, and, in
particular in metal-poor dwarf models with [Fe/H] = −2.0,
the 3D NLTE results are close to 1D LTE.
– The impact of convection is modest for the high-excitation
Mn i lines with lower excitation potential > 2 eV. In particular, the least affected lines are those belonging to multiplets
9, 23, 24, and 32. We recommend to use these lines for the
abundance analysis in 1D NLTE.
– 3D LTE modelling substantially over-estimates the line
strength of resonance Mn i lines, compared to 1D LTE and
3D NLTE. As a consequence, the excitation imbalance reported for Mn i lines across a broad metallicity range (Bonifacio et al. 2009) will not be cured, but rather amplified using
3D LTE.

– All IR H-band lines of Mn i suffer from strong systematic
bias. 1D LTE under-estimates the abundance derived from
these lines by 0.2 to 0.35 dex. On the other hand, the difference between 1D NLTE and 3D NLTE is only −0.15 dex,
and this value does not depend on [Fe/H], T eff , or log g of
the model atmosphere. We suggest to employ this correction
in 1D NLTE studies, in order to account for 3D effects.
We derive new 3D NLTE solar abundance of Mn, 5.52 ± 0.03
dex, which is consistent with the CI meteoritic abundance, 5.50±
0.03 (Lodders 2003). The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE abundances are
lower, 5.34 ± 0.04 dex in LTE, 5.41 ± 0.05 dex in NLTE. Our 3D
NLTE value is slightly higher compared to Asplund et al. (2009)
and Scott et al. (2015), 5.42 ± 0.04 dex, however, they did not
compute full 3D NLTE, but applied the NLTE corrections computed using a 1D model. In particular, in the latter study, we employed a Mn atom with Drawin’s collision rates and hydrogenic
photo-ionisation, in contrast to the detailed quantum-mechanical
data in this work.
Our results for the metal-poor benchmark stars offer a considerably different picture on Mn abundances at low metallicity,
contrasting with earlier 1D LTE studies. We find that 3D NLTE
abundances in HD 84937, HD 140283, and HD 122563 are significantly higher. For HD 122563, we obtain a perfect ionisation
balance in 3D NLTE, that cannot be otherwise explained by the
atomic data uncertainties and stellar parameters. The 3D NLTE
Mn abundances derived from the Mn i lines are ∼ 0.5 − 0.7 (HD
84937, HD 140283) to 1 dex (HD 122563) higher compared to
1D LTE results. Also the 3D NLTE abundance derived from the
Mn ii lines are ∼ 0.15 (HD 84937, HD 140283) to 0.4 dex (HD
122563) larger compared to 1D LTE. Effects of this magnitude
are also expected for other stars in this metallicity regime. We
strongly recommend applying NLTE, and, if possible, 3D NLTE
radiative transfer in the analysis of Mn lines. Alternatively, the
Mn i lines of certain multiplets (see above) can be used as a relatively reliable (with a bias of ∼ 0.1 dex) diagnostics with hydrostatic models.
In the next paper in the series (Eitner et al. in prep), we will
apply the models developed in this work to a large sample of
stars to explore the chemical evolution and nucleosynthesis of
Mn in the Galaxy.
