Abstract—Hardware non-idealities are among the main performance restrictions for upcoming wireless communication systems.
Asymmetric hardware distortions (HWD) happen when the
impairments of the I/Q branches are correlated or imbalanced,
which in turn generate improper additive interference at the
receiver side. When the interference is improper, as well as in
other interference-limited scenarios, improper Gaussian signaling
(IGS) has been shown to provide rate and/or power efficiency
benefits. In this paper, we investigate the rate benefits of IGS in
a two-user interference channel (IC) with additive asymmetric
HWD when interference is treated as noise. We propose two
iterative algorithms to optimize the parameters of the improper
transmit signals. We first rewrite the rate region as an pseudosignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (PSINR) region and employ majorization minimization and fractional programming to
find a suboptimal solution for the achievable user rates. Then, we
propose a simplified algorithm based on a separate optimization
of the powers and complementary variances of the users, which
exhibits lower computational complexity. We show that IGS can
improve the performance of the two-user IC with additive HWD.
Our proposed algorithms outperform proper Gaussian signaling
and competing IGS algorithms in the literature that do not
consider asymmetric HWD.

I. I NTRODUCTION
One of the targets of 5G is reaching a data rate more
than 1000 times greater than the data rate of current cellular systems [1]. However, reaching this goal entails many
challenges. Among them is to overcome the non-idealities,
i.e., hardware distortions (HWD), of devices which can result
in a substantial performance degradation [2]–[4]. HWD are
due to various imperfections in transceivers, including I/Q
imbalance, non-linear power amplifiers, imperfect and/or low
resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters,
frequency/phase offset and so on [3]–[10]. Another main

challenge for data-rate enhancement is to handle interference from other users, and hence interference management
techniques play a key role in 5G [1]. Recently, it has been
shown that improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) can improve the
performance of various interference-limited systems [11]–[26].
In IGS schemes, the real and imaginary parts of the signal are
correlated and/or have unequal powers [27], [28]. While proper
Gaussian signaling (PGS) achieves channel capacity for pointto-point communications in the presence of proper Gaussian
noise [29], this is not the case under improper Gaussian noise
that arises as a result of asymmetric HWD [4], [11], [30], [31].
A. Related work
The effect of HWD is studied in [5]–[10] for various
scenarios. In [5], the secrecy performance of downlink massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems was considered with HWD and a passive multiple-antenna eavesdropper.
The paper [6] analyzed the achievable rate of massive MIMO
systems with Rician channels and HWD. In [7], the authors
considered a full-duplex massive MIMO relay with HWD and
proposed a scheme to mitigate the distortion by exploiting
statistical knowledge of the channels. In [8], the authors
studied a massive MIMO system with a new system model
for HWD at the transceivers. The paper [10] studied the
performance of dual-hop relaying with different protocols in
the presence of HWD.
In the aforementioned papers, symmetric HWD are considered. Nevertheless, HWD can, in general, provoke asymmetric
or improper distortion in both the transmitted and received
signal [4], [11], [30]–[32]. The paper [4] considered IGS in
a single-input, multiple-output (SIMO) system with additive
asymmetric HWD and showed that IGS improved the performance of the system. In [11], the authors investigated the effect
of IGS in a relay network with additive asymmetric HWD.
They maximized the achievable rate of the relay network
by optimizing the complementary variance of the transmitted
signal in the source and relay nodes.
Improper signaling schemes have also been proposed to
improve different performance metrics in interference-limited
networks with ideal devices [12]–[23], [26]. In [12], IGS
was considered as an interference management tool for the
first time in the literature, where the authors considered a
three-user interference channel (IC) and showed that IGS
can improve the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) in this scenario.

2

The paper [13] showed that IGS can increase the DoF of
MIMO X channels. In [14]–[23], [25], the authors studied
the performance of IGS when Treating Interference as Noise
(TIN) was the strategy used for decoding. The paper [14]
showed that IGS can improve the performance of the two-user
interference channel, while in [15] IGS was used to optimize
the rate of the K-user MIMO interference channel. Moreover,
the authors in [15] derived the rate region of the two-user
single-input, single-output (SISO) IC with TIN by solving a
semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, showing that IGS
can enlarge the rate region and improve the performance of
the system. The paper [16] showed that IGS can reduce the
symbol error rate of the K-user IC. In [17]–[19], benefits of
IGS were studied in different Z-IC scenarios. In [20], [21], the
authors showed that IGS improves the performance of underlay
and overlay cognitive radio systems, respectively. Finally, [26]
showed that IGS can improve the performance of full-duplex
relaying systems with fading channels.
B. Contribution
In this paper, we study the performance of IGS in a two-user
IC with additive asymmetric HWD with TIN. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first work addressing the SISO IC with
asymmetric HWD. We assume that the transceivers of both
users produce additive asymmetric HWD noise, and model
the HWD as an additive improper Gaussian noise, similar to
[4], [11], [30], [31]. We devise two iterative algorithms to
derive suboptimal solutions for the achievable rate region of
the two-user IC. To this end, we rewrite the rate region as a
pseudo-signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (PSINR) region
and employ sequential optimization approaches to solve the
resulting problems.
In our first proposed algorithm, we employ majorization
minimization (MM) as well as fractional programming (FP)
and the well-known generalized Dinkelbach algorithm. MM
is an iterative algorithm and consists of two steps in every
iteration: i) majorization, and ii) minimization [33]. In the
majorization step, the objective function is approximated by
a surrogate function. Then, the approximated problem is
solved in the minimization step. In other words, MM solves
a non-convex optimization problem by solving a sequence of
surrogate optimization problems, which can be solved easier
than the original problem [33]. In our algorithm, to solve
each surrogate problem, we apply the generalized Dinkelbach
algorithm, which is a powerful tool to solve multiple ratio
maximin problems [34], [35]. In Dinkelbach-based algorithms,
an iterative optimization is performed, in which the fractional
functions are replaced by surrogate functions at each iteration. The generalized Dinkelbach algorithm permits solving
fractional programming efficiently and results in the global
optimal solution of the original optimization problem if the
optimization problem at each iteration is perfectly solved, i.e.,
its global optimum is obtained [34]–[37].
In our second proposed algorithm, we employ a separate
optimization of powers and complementary variances. We first
optimize the powers transmitted by the users by employing the
well-known bisection method, which transforms the original
problem into a sequence of feasibility problems, and derive

a closed-form solution for the feasibility problem. In order
to obtain the complementary variances, we employ difference
of convex programming (DCP), which is a special case of
sequential convex programming (SCP) and falls into MM [33],
[38]. In DCP, the objective function and/or constraints are
difference of two convex/concave functions. DCP solves a nonconvex problem by solving a sequence of convex optimization
problems and converges to a stationary point1 of the original
problem [38].
The main contributions of this paper are as in the following:
• We first propose an iterative algorithm based on a sequential optimization method, in which we solve a sequence
of fractional optimization problems [33], [39]. We derive
the global optimal solution of each surrogate problem
by FP and the generalized Dinkelbach algorithm. Our
first proposed algorithm obtains a stationary point of the
PSINR region.
• We also propose a simplified algorithm that is computationally less expensive than our proposed algorithm
with FP. This simplified algorithm is based on a separate
optimization of powers and complementary variances of
users. We employ a bisection method to obtain the powers
and derive a closed-form solution for powers in each iteration. Then, we employ DCP to find the complementary
variances.
• Our results show that IGS enlarges the achievable rate of
the two-user IC in the presence of additive asymmetric
HWD, and that there is a significant performance improvement by IGS for highly asymmetric HWD noise.
Moreover, both of our proposed algorithms outperform
existing PGS and other existing IGS algorithms.
C. Paper outline
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II describes the scenario and formulates the achievable-rateregion problem. In Section III, we propose our algorithm based
on MM and FP, and in Section IV, we develop a simplified
version of this algorithm. Finally, Section V presents some
numerical results.
II. S YSTEM M ODEL
A. Preliminaries of IGS
Let us consider a zero-mean complex Gaussian random
variable x with variance px = E{|x|2 } and complementary
variance qx = E{x2 } [27], [28]. Note that the complementary
variance is complex and |qx | ≤ px . We denote the probability
distribution of x by x ∼ CN (mx , px , qx ), where mx = 0 is
the mean of x. We define the complex correlation coefficient
of x as κ̃x = pqxx , where |κ̃x | ∈ [0, 1] is the so-called circularity
coefficient. If κ̃x = 0, x is proper; otherwise, it is improper
[27], [28]. We call x maximally improper if |κ̃x | = 1.
B. Hardware distortion model
In this paper, we employ the distortion model in [4], [11],
[30], [31] and model the aggregated effect of HWD on the

corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions [38].

transceiver of a communication link with an improper Gaussian
additive noise as
√
(1)
y = P h(x + η) + n,
where y, x, P , h, η, and n are the received signal, transmitted
symbol, transmission power, channel coefficient, aggregated
HWD noise and additive complex proper Gaussian noise,
respectively. The aggregated HWD noise is modeled as an
improper complex Gaussian random variable with probability
distribution η ∼ CN (0, ση2 , σ̃η2 ), where ση2 = ση2TX + ση2RX and
σ̃η2 = σ̃η2TX + σ̃η2RX are the variance and complementary variance
of η, respectively, both of which are composed of contributions
at the transmitter side (denoted TX) and the receiver side
(denoted RX). Please refer to [30, Lemma 1] for more details
about this model.
It is worth mentioning that this model is an extension
of the model in [5]–[10], where the HWD is modeled as
additive proper Gaussian noise. However, as indicated in e.g.,
[4], [11], [30]–[32], [40]–[42], the aggregated HWD is, in
general, improper due to I/Q imbalance. Note that the variances
and complementary variances of HWD noise are not only a
function of device parameters, but also a linear function of
the transmission power and channel gain, meaning that higher
transmission power results in higher HWD noise [4], [30].
Moreover, even if the channel noise is proper, the aggregated
distortion is improper due to the asymmetric HWD.
C. Network scenario and signal model
We consider a two-user IC with additive asymmetric HWD
at the transmitters and receivers of both users, as depicted
in Fig. 1.2 We assume that users are allowed to employ IGS
and treat the interference as noise. Using the proposed HWD
model, the received signals at receiver k is
√
√
yk = p1 h1k (x1 + η1k ) + p2 h2k (x2 + η2k ) + nk , (2)
respectively, where xk , hjk , nk , and ηjk for j, k ∈ {1, 2} are
the transmit signal of user k, channel between transmitter j and
receiver k, independent zero-mean proper complex Gaussian
noise with variance σ 2 , and the aggregated HWD noise of
the link between transmitter j and receiver k, respectively.
Since the transmitted signals x1 and x2 are improper complex
Gaussian, the achievable rate of user k ∈ {1, 2} is [11], [15],
[19] given by (3), shown at the top of the next page, where
2 It is worth mentioning that our algorithms can easily be extended to the Kuser IC. However, we consider only the 2-user IC for the ease of illustration.

pk , qk , ση2jk , and σ̃η2jk for i, j ∈ {1, 2} are, respectively, the
transmission power of user k,the complementary variance of
the transmitted signal of user k, the aggregated variance and
the complementary variance of the HWD noise in the link
between user j and user k. The rate of user k ∈ {1, 2} can be
written using vector notation as
!
(σ 2 + aTk p)2 − |fkH q + f̃kH p|2
1
, (4)
Rk = log2
2
(σ 2 + bTk p)2 − |gkH q + f̃kH p|2
where the corresponding parameters are defined in (5)-(9),
shown at the top of the next page. We also define Ω = {pk , qk :
0 ≤ pk ≤ Pk , |qk | ≤ pk , k = 1, 2} as the feasible set of the
design parameters, where Pk is the power budget of user k.
Note that since qk for k = 1, 2 is the complementary variance
of user k, its absolute value has to be not greater than the
transmission power of user k, i.e., |qk | ≤ pk .
It is to be noted that, in practice, discrete rather than
Gaussian signaling is employed (see, e.g., [16], [42], [43]),
which will lead to performance degradation with respect to
IGS. The significance of studying improper Gaussian signals
is that it shows us whether improper signaling may in principle
achieve performance improvements over proper signaling. In
this paper, we focus on IGS and leave the analysis and design
of improper discrete constellations for future work.
D. Problem Statement
In this paper, we aim at obtaining the boundary of the
achievable rate region for the described two-user IC. To this
end, we employ the following definition of the Pareto boundary
for the achievable rate region.
Definition 1 ( [19], [44]). The rate pair (R1 , R2 ) is called
Pareto-optimal if (R10 , R2 ) and (R1 , R20 ), with R10 > R1 and
R20 > R2 , are not achievable.
The rate region is the
S union of all these achievable rate
tuples, i.e., R =
(R1 , R2 ), and its boundary can
{p,q}∈Ω

be derived by the rate profile technique as in the following

where λ1 , λ2 ≥ 0 are fixed and λ1 + λ2 = 1. We can obtain
the boundary of the rate region by solving (10) for different
rate-profile parameters, i.e., λ1 and λ2 . Note there are efficient
algorithms to derive the global optimal solution of convex
optimization problems [39], [45], [46]. However, we are unable
to apply these algorithms to (10) due to the fact that the
rates are not concave functions of the optimization variables,
which makes (10) non-convex [39], [45], [46]. Hence, in this
paper we propose numerical algorithms to derive suboptimal
solutions to (10).

We can derive the boundary of the PSINR region by varying

are non-negative. Moreover, the numerator and denominator
of Ek (p, q) are strictly positive because the rates are bounded
and non-negative. In the following lemma, we show that this
technique results in the boundary of the rate region in (10).

Lemma 1 ( [47], [48]). Every point in the boundary of the rate
region corresponds to a point in the boundary of the PSINR
region, and vice versa.
Proof: Assume there exists a pair (R1 , R2 ) on the boundary of the achievable rate region that is not on the boundary of
the PSINR region. In other words, the pair (E1 = 2R1 , E2 =
2R2 ), which is a feasible PSINR pair, is not on the boundary of
the PSINR region, and hence there exist E10 and/or E20 such that
the pairs (E10 > E1 , E2 ) and/or (E1 , E20 > E2 ) are feasible.
Since the logarithm functions are monotonically increasing,
the rate pairs (0.5 log2 (E10 ) > R1 , R2 ) or (R1 , 0.5 log2 (E20 ) >

additive asymmetric HWD, in which all nodes transmit with
maximum power, by optimizing over the complementary variances. Such algorithms cannot be applied for a joint optimization of powers and complementary variances since, in this case,
the rates are not a difference of two jointly concave/convex
functions in p and q. Hence, we solve (10) by MM and FP. In
MM, the objective function and constraints of an optimization
problem are not required to follow a very specific structure
such as being a difference of two convex/concave functions,
which makes it more powerful than DCP.
To solve (10), we rewrite it such that it is more suitable to
be solved with MM and FP. To this end, we employ the PSINR
profile technique in [47], [48] to write an optimization problem
that results in the solution of (10). We define the PSINR profile

every point in the boundary of the PSINR region associates
with a point in the boundary of the rate region.

III. B OUNDARY OF THE RATE REGION BY F RACTIONAL
P ROGRAMMING
In this section, we solve the PSINR profile problem in (11)
by MM, which results in solving a sequence of fractional
optimization problems. We solve each fractional optimization
problem by FP and the generalized Dinkelbach algorithm
[35]–[37]. Our proposed algorithm converges to a stationary
point of (11). We first provide preliminaries on generalized
Dinkelbach’s algorithm in Section III-A and then propose our
algorithm in III-B.
A. Preliminaries of generalized Dinkelbach’s algorithm
Dinkelbach’s algorithm is a powerful tool that solves FP
problems, which was proposed to handle single-ratio functions.
The generalized Dinkelbach algorithm is a modified Dinkelbach algorithm to solve maximin multiple-ratio problems [34].
The generalized Dinkelbach algorithm is an iterative approach,
in which the fractional functions are approximated by surrogate
functions at each iteration. In the following lemma, we present
some conditions that are used in the generalized Dinkelbach
algorithm.
(x)
,
Lemma 2 ([34], [35]). Consider the fractional functions uvii(x)
where ui (x) and vi (x) are continuous in x, vi (x) is strictly
positive in x, and x is a vector with dimension n that belongs
to a compact set X . Let us define

V (µ) = max min (ui (x) − µvi (x)) ,
x
i


ui (x)
µ̄ = max min

x

(14)
(15)

where V (µ), µ̄, and µ are real and scalar, and have the
following properties.
1) V (µ) is continuous and strictly decreasing in µ.

5

2) The optimization problems (14) and (15) always have
optimal solutions.
3) µ̄ is finite and V (µ̄) = 0.
4) V (µ) has a unique root, and V (µ) = 0 implies µ = µ̄.
The generalized Dinkelbach algorithm employs the surrogate function V (µ) in (14) and tries to iteratively find the
unique root of V (µ), i.e., µ̄. The algorithm starts with an initial
point, e.g., µ(0) = 0, then it updates µ to obtain µ̄. Assuming
ui (x) ≥ 0, which is the case we consider in this paper,
V (0) = max min (ui (x)) > 0. Since V (µ) is continuous and
x
i
strictly decreasing in µ, µ is chosen monotonically increasing
at each iteration (µ(l) > µ(l−1) ) until V (µ) approaches 0. At
the lth iteration, µ(l) is

B. Proposed algorithm
We can apply the generalized Dinkelbach algorithm to
derive the boundary of the PSINR region since the optimization
problem can be written as a maximin weighted problem as
indicated in (13). However, since uk (p, q) and vk (p, q) are
not, respectively, concave and convex in optimization variables,
the corresponding optimization problem in each iteration of
the generalized Dinkelbach algorithm is not convex. Indeed,
uk (p, q) and vk (p, q) are a difference of two convex/concave
functions:
uk (p, q) = −|fkH q + f̃kH p|2 + (σ 2 + aTk p)2 ,

iteration is
ũk (p, q) = − |fkH q + f̃kH p|2 + (σ 2 + aTk p(m) )2

(17)

The generalized Dinkelbach algorithm updates µ and x
based on (16) and (17), respectively, until a convergence metric
is met, e.g., V (µ(l) ) < , where  > 0. This algorithm
converges linearly to the optimal solution [34].
Note that in order to apply the generalized Dinkelbach
algorithm, it is not required that ui (x) and vi (x) fulfill any
other condition (except those in the lemma), which makes
this algorithm a powerful tool to solve different types of
fractional problems. If ui (x) and vi (x) are concave and
convex functions, respectively, the optimization problem at
each iteration is convex and can easily be solved. However,
in the general case, it might be difficult to efficiently solve the
optimization problem at each iteration.

convex part

Hence, to solve (13), we employ a sequential optimization
approach by approximating Ek (p, q) with a lower bound
Ẽk (p, q, µ) in each iteration [33], [39]. Then, we obtain the
global optimal solution of each surrogate optimization problem
by the generalized Dinkelbach algorithm. To this end, in each
iteration, we first approximate uk (p, q) by a lower bound
concave function ũk (p, q) and vk (p, q) by an upper bound
convex function ṽk (p, q) as in the following lemma.

(20)

Moreover, a convex upper bound for vk (p, q) in the mth

where p(m) and q(m) are the power and complementary
variances at the mth iteration, which are the solution of the
previous iteration. Furthermore, R [x] takes the real part of x.

These properties guarantee that the algorithm converges to

and obtain p(m+1) and q(m+1) , we employ the generalized
Dinkelbach algorithm, which gives the global optimal solution
of (22), as in the following. We summarize this procedure in
Algorithm I.
Now we solve (22) and obtain its global optimal solution by
FP, which is also an iterative algorithm as explained in Section

which allows us to simplify (26) and derive a low-complexity
algorithm.

We solve (25) for the given µ(l) , which results in p(l) and q(l) .
Then, we update µ(l) by (24) and repeat the procedure until
a convergence metric is met. As indicated in Section III-A,
the convergence rate of the generalized Dinkelbach algorithm
is linear. The optimization problem (25) is convex, and its
global optimal solution can be efficiently obtained [45]. We
summarize this procedure in Algorithm II.
To sum up, the proposed algorithm works as follows. We
solve the PSINR profile in (11) by solving a sequence of
fractional optimization problems. Indeed, we employ a sequential optimization approach and approximate the PSINR
term of each user by a lower bound. In order to derive
the global optimal solution of each fractional optimization
problem, we perform another iterative algorithm, i.e., the generalized Dinkelbach algorithm. It is worth mentioning that this
algorithm does not converge to the Pareto-optimal solution;
however, it obtains a stationary point of (11).

where 0 ≤ t < β2 < β1 . The lower bound in (27) is then
satisfied if f (t) is increasing in t. This function is strictly
increasing in t ∈ [0, β2 ) since

IV. S IMPLIFIED ALGORITHM

It is worth mentioning that the lower bound in Lemma 4
is employed to simplify (26) and obtain the powers, and the
actual rates are derived by substituting the obtained powers in
(3). Note that the region achieved by solving (26) includes the
region achieved by solving (31). If the additive HWD noise

In this section, we propose a simplified version of the algorithm from Section III, which exhibits a lower computational
complexity. In the simplified algorithm, we first optimize the
transmission power p for PGS, i.e., for q = 0. This problem is

is proper, (31) is equivalent to (26)3 . The global optimum
solution of (31) can be derived by employing a bisection
method and solving a sequence of feasibility problems [39].
That is, we fix E as E 0 and consider the feasibility problem
(32), shown at the top of the next page. If (32) is feasible for a
given E 0 , the optimal solution of (31) is greater than or equal to
E 0 , i.e., E ? ≥ E 0 . Otherwise, E ? < E 0 . In order to find E ? , we
employ the well-known bisection method over E 0 solving (32)
at each iteration, which yields, upon convergence, the global
optimal solution of (31) [45]. Constraints (32b) and (32c) are
linear in p, which permits deriving a closed-form expression
for a feasible point, as presented in the following theorem.
It is worth mentioning that this algorithm does not attain the
global optimal solution of (26). There might be optimization
approaches to obtain its global optimal solution such as the
monotonic optimization framework [50]–[52], although the
computational complexity of these approaches is high.

a given E 0 if and only if 0 ≤ p0k ≤ Pk , for k = 1, 2, where

Moreover, A is given by (34), shown at the top of the next

Proof: Please refer to Appendix B.
We note that this algorithm leads to the optimal PGS only
when HWD noise is proper. Note that PGS is suboptimal, in
point-to-point communications, in the presence of asymmetric
HWD [4], [31]. Thus, the users may improve the performance
by employing IGS in additive asymmetric HWD. It is worth
noting that, in this paper, we aim at proposing PGS and IGS
schemes for the two-user IC with additive asymmetric HWD,
but we do not derive sufficient and necessary conditions for
the optimality of IGS or PGS in the two-user IC with additive
asymmetric HWD, which remains an open problem.

In this subsection, we optimize the complementary variances
q for a given p? , which has been obtained by solving (31).
We obtain q such that the rates of both users exceed the rates
achieved by PGS, which are the rates achievable with q = 0
and the power vector p? obtained by solving (31). In other
words, we want to solve the optimization problem (35), shown
at the top of this page, where p?k is the kth element of p? .
Moreover, Ep,k is fixed and given by
(σ 2 + aTk p? )2 − |f̃kH p? |2
.
(σ 2 + bTk p? )2 − |f̃kH p? |2

(36)

Unfortunately, (35) is not convex due to (35b). Hence, in order
to efficiently solve (35), we first rewrite (35b) as
(σ 2 + aTk p? )2 − |fkH q + f̃kH p? |2 − αk tk
≥ Ep,k ,
(σ 2 + bTk p? )2 − |gkH q + f̃kH p? |2

Ep,k |gkH q + f̃kH p? |2 − |fkH q + f̃kH p? |2
+ (σ 2 + aTk p? )2 − Ep,k (σ 2 + bTk p? )2 ≥ αk tk , (39)
which is a difference of two convex functions. Thus, (38) is
not a convex optimization problem, but it can be efficiently
solved by difference of convex programming and a convexconcave procedure similar to (25) [33], [38], [53]–[55]. Hence,
we employ difference of convex programming (DCP) and solve
(38) iteratively. At each iteration, we approximate the left-hand
side of (39) by a concave function. To this end, we employ
the first-order Taylor expansion and approximate the convex
part of (39) around the point q(l) by an affine function as
|gkH q + f̃kH p? |2 ' |gkH q(l) + f̃kH p? |2


+ 2R (gkH q(l) + f̃kH p? )∗ gkH (q − q(l) ) , (40)
where q(l) contains the complementary variances of the users
in the lth iteration. It is worth mentioning that |giH q + f̃iH p? |2
is always greater than or equal to the right-hand side of (40),
and consequently, no trust region is required in DCP [53]–[55].
Finally, in the lth each iteration, (39) can be approximated by
− |fkH q + f̃kH p? |2 + Ep,k |gkH q(l) + f̃kH p? |2


+ 2Ep,k R (gkH q(l) + f̃kH p? )H gkH (q − q(l) )

Finally, the convex optimization problem in the lth iteration is

where tk = t (σ 2 + bTk p? )2 − |gkH q + f̃kH p? |2 . We then relax the relation between t1 , t2 , and q and treat t1 and t2 as new
optimization variables. In other words, we approximate (35)
as (38), shown at the top of this page. If min(t1 , t2 ) > 0, the
rates of both users are simultaneously increased by employing
IGS. Otherwise, we set q = 0 and employ PGS. Note that the
constraint (38b) can be rewritten as

(37)

This is in line with [49], where it was shown that proper Gaussian noise
is the worst case in a K-user MIMO IC with ideal devices.

This problem can be easily solved by standard numerical
tools [45]. Moreover, the proposed DCP algorithm converges
to a stationary point of (38) [33], [38], [53]–[55]. It is worth
mentioning that a stationary point of (38) is not necessarily a
stationary point of (35).
The proposed simplified algorithm can be summarized as
follows. The joint optimization problem for p and q is decoupled into two separate optimization problems. We derive
the transmission powers by employing the well-known bisection method, which results, in each iteration, in a feasibility
problem that has a closed-form solution. Then, we employ the
DCP algorithm to derive the complementary variances for the
given transmission powers.

and M are, respectively, the threshold for convergence, and
the maximum number of iterations for Algorithms I and II.
Moreover, the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm
in Section IV-B is 40. We also define the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) as the ratio of the power budget to σ 2 , i.e., SNR= σP2 .
We compare our proposed algorithms with PGS and the joint
variance and complementary variance optimization algorithm
in [15] for IGS, which is designed for ideal devices. To the
best of our knowledge, there exists no PGS algorithm for
additive asymmetric HWD in the literature. Because of that,
we optimize the PGS scheme by using the first step of our
simplified algorithm (see Section IV-A). In the figures, we use
the following labels:
• S-IGS: our proposed simplified design in Section IV,
• FP-IGS: our proposed design with FP in Section III,
• PGS: the proposed PGS design in Section IV-A,
• I-IGS: the joint variance and complementary variance
IGS design in [15] for ideal devices,
• S-TS: our proposed design in Section IV with time
sharing,
• F-TS: our proposed design in Section III with time
sharing,
• P-TS: the proposed PGS design in Section IV-A with time
sharing.
A. Ideal devices
In this subsection, we compare the performance of our
proposed algorithms with the joint variance and covariance
IGS algorithm in [15] when there is no HWD. In Fig. 2,
we show the average symmetric rate, i.e., the minimum rate
allocated to the users, which is the fairness point of the rate
region boundary and obtained by α1 = α2 = 0.5. We average

the results over 100 channel realizations, where each channel
realization is taken from a complex proper Gaussian distribution with variance 1, i.e., CN (0, 1, 0). As can be observed,
our proposed algorithm based on FP outperforms the proposed
algorithm in [15], especially at high SNR. Our simplified
algorithm performs similarly to the proposed algorithm in [15]
for low SNR. However, the algorithm in [15] performs better
than the simplified algorithm in the moderate SNR regime.
The reason is that the benefit of employing IGS increases with
SNR. Thus, the performance differences of the IGS algorithms
are clearer at higher SNR.
In Fig. 3, we also provide rate region examples for ideal
devices and the channel realization

where [H1 ]ij = hij for i, j ∈ {1, 2}. As can be observed,
IGS can enlarge the achievable rate region for this channel
realization and P = 10. Since the benefits of IGS are minor
for low SNR, IGS does not provide any gain for P = 1. This is
also in line with the averaged results in Fig. 2, where IGS has
minor benefits at low SNR, while it improves the performance
of the system significantly at moderate SNR. For this channel
realization, our proposed algorithms and the algorithm in [15]
perform very closely to each other. In Fig. 3b, we also consider
the effect of time sharing4 on the achievable rate region. As
can be observed, IGS with time sharing outperforms PGS with
time sharing for this example. Since the IGS designs perform
similarly, for this example, we provide only the time sharing
for our proposed IGS design in Section III.
The joint variance and covariance IGS algorithm in [15] is
an iterative algorithm, based on a bisection method over the
minimum weighted rates of users, and is proposed for ideal
devices. The algorithm employs semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
programming in order to solve the corresponding feasibility
problem at each iteration of the bisection method. Since the
solution of the SDR in [15] is not ensured to be rank-one, it
does not necessarily obtain a valid solution, and a Gaussian
randomization procedure is employed to obtain a rank-one
solution. The solution obtained by the randomization procedure
is not ensured to fulfill any optimality condition, which is in
contrast with our proposed algorithm, which converges to a
stationary point of (11). That may be the reason why our
algorithm provides a better average symmetric rate than SDR
for high SNR in this scenario. It is also worth mentioning that
our proposed algorithms are more general since they consider
additive asymmetric HWD, while the algorithm in [15] can
only be applied for ideal devices.
4 We derive the achievable rate region with TS by taking the convex hull
operation over the corresponding achievable rate regions [15]. It is worth
mentioning that time sharing results in the convex hull operation when power
constraint is considered for each operational point. The achievable rate region
with time sharing might be enlarged if an average power constraint over
different operational point is considered [56]. However, this analysis is outside
of the scope of this paper.

B. Non-ideal devices
In this subsection, we consider the effect of HWD on the
performance of the two-user IC. Throughout this subsection,
we consider the same statistics for HWD in all devices. In
Fig. 4, we show the rate region for H1 and P = 1 under
maximally improper HWD5 noise. As shown in Fig. 3a, IGS
brings negligible gains when the transceivers are ideal, but,
as observed in Fig. 4, IGS can significantly enlarge the rate
region if there is additive asymmetric HWD. Note that even in
point-to-point communications, PGS is in general suboptimal
for asymmetric HWD, as it is shown in Fig. 4 for either R1 = 0
or R2 = 0.
In Fig. 5, we show the achievable rate region for σ̃η2 = 0,
P = 1 (SNR= 0 dB), and channel realization

(44)
1.8542ei2.8153 0.6277ei2.3697
We take σ̃η2 = 0, i.e., symmetric (proper) HWD. We can
observe that IGS enlarges the rate region even for proper HWD
with high noise variance, i.e., ση2 = 0.5 and ση2 = 1. It is
worth mentioning that the PGS design is Pareto-optimal in the
presence of additive symmetric HWD. As can be observed,
our IGS design in Section III with time sharing outperforms
the Pareto-optimal PGS with time sharing for these examples.
In the following, we provide some averaged results for
different parameters to illustrate different aspects of employing
IGS. Similar to Fig. 2, we average the results over 100 channel
realizations, where each channel realization is taken from a
complex proper Gaussian distribution with variance 1, i.e.,
CN (0, 1, 0).
In Fig. 6, we consider the effect of the variance of the HWD
noise on the average symmetric rate of users (α1 = α2 = 0.5)
for P = 20. In this figure, we consider proper (σ̃η2 = 0)
and maximally improper (σ̃η2 = ση2 ) HWD noise. We observe
that our proposed algorithm with FP outperforms the other
algorithms for maximally improper HWD noise. Moreover,
in Fig. 6a, our proposed IGS algorithms perform better than
5 Maximally improper HWD happens when the in-phase and quadraturephase noises are completely correlated [30].

when ση2 = 1 for this example.

the circularity coefficient of the HWD noise, and there is a
considerable performance improvement by IGS in maximally
improper HWD noise. We emphasize that PGS is suboptimal,
even in interference-free communications, under asymmetric
HWD. Our proposed IGS design with FP outperforms the
other algorithms, especially in highly asymmetric HWD noise.
When the variance of the HWD noise is small, the gain of
employing IGS is larger. The other interesting result in this
figure is that our simplified algorithm performs very similarly
to our proposed algorithm based on FP for proper HWD. Since
the simplified algorithm has less computational cost, it can be
employed for proper HWD noise when the variance of the
HWD noise is high, i.e., ση2 ≥ 0.5. However, our proposed
algorithm based on FP outperforms the other algorithm in
low-power HWD noise and/or highly asymmetric HWD noise.
Note that, since the IGS algorithm in [15] is proposed for ideal
devices and does not consider HWD, it performs worse than
the proposed PGS, which considers additive symmetric HWD,
from the average symmetric rate point of view, even when the
HWD noise is maximally improper.
In Fig. 8, we consider the effect of the power budget on
the symmetric rate of users. There is an almost constant
performance gap between our proposed algorithms and the
other algorithms. Similar to the other figures, our proposed
IGS with FP outperforms our simplified algorithm.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we considered a two-user IC with additive
asymmetric HWD at the transceivers. Treating interference as
noise, we addressed the problem of obtaining the achievable
rate region for IGS and proposed two suboptimal algorithms.
The first algorithm, which is based on MM and the generalized
Dinkelbach algorithm, obtains a stationary point of the PSINR
region. In this algorithm, we jointly optimize the powers and
complementary variances. We also proposed a simplified algorithm that has lower computational complexity. This simplified
algorithm is based on the separate optimization of the powers
and complementary variances. Through numerical examples,
we showed that the proposed approaches enlarge the achievable

rate region and outperform PGS and existing IGS algorithms,
especially as the HWD becomes more asymmetric.

In order to approximate uk (p, q) and vk (p, q), we employ convex-concave (or concave-convex) procedure (CCP),
in which the convex (concave) part is approximated as an
affine function by the first-order approximation of the Taylor
expansion. Note that we take the first-order term and employ
an affine approximation since an affine function is the nearest
concave approximation to a convex function. The first-order
approximation of a real function u(x) around the point x0 is
obtained through its Taylor expansion as [27], [57]

Γ (x) ≈ Γ (x0 ) + 2R (

where x is a complex vector. In order to apply the CCP to
uk (p, q), we have to differentiate the convex part in (18)
with respect to p, which is straightforward since it is a real
function on a real domain and consequently, analytic in p. The
derivative of (σ 2 + aTk p)2 with respect to p is
∂(σ 2 + aTk p)2

and the resulting first-order approximation around the power
vector in the mth iteration, p(m) , is given by
(σ 2 + aTk p)2 ' (σ 2 + aTk p(m) )2
+ 2(σ 2 + aTk p(m) )aTk (p − p(m) ). (47)
By substituting (47) in (18), we can derive ũk (p, q).
In order to convexify vk (p, q), we have to differentiate the
concave part in (19) with respect to p and q. The derivative of
|gkH q + f̃kH p|2 with respect to p is also straightforward since
it is analytic in p:

The term |gkH q + f̃kH p|2 , on the other hand, is not analytic

By Wirtinger calculus, we treat q and q∗ as two independent

A given E 0 is feasible if and only if there exists at least
a pair (p1 , p2 ) that satisfies all the constraints in (32). Let us
first consider the two linear constraints in (32b), which can be
written as (51) and (52), shown at the top of the next page.
We can construct A in (34) by the coefficients of p1 and p2
in (51) and (52). It is worth mentioning that the
√ non-diagonal
1 + α1 E 0 ≥ 1
elements
of
A
in
(34)
are
non-positive
since
√
0
and 1 + α2 E ≥ 1. Thus, if the diagonal elements of A are
not positive, there is no positive power pair that satisfies (51)
and (52) simultaneously. Hence, in the following, we assume
without loss of generality that A has strictly positive diagonal
elements and strictly negative non-diagonal elements.
We can rewrite (51) and (52) as
[A]11 p1 ≥ −[A]12 p2 + y1 ,

where y = ( 1 + α1 E 0 − 1)σ 2 ( 1 + α2 E 0 − 1)σ 2

Moreover, [A]ij , and yi for i, j ∈ {1, 2} are the ijth element

of A, and the ith element of y, respectively. If we decouple
the inequalities, we end up with
det(A)p1 ≥ [A]22 y1 − [A]12 y2 ,

(55)

det(A)p2 ≥ −[A]21 y1 + [A]11 y2 .

(56)

The right-hand sides (RHS) in (55) and (56) are positive for a
feasible E 0 as mentioned before. Note that if det(A) < 0, there
are no positive power pairs that satisfy (55) and (56) for the
given structure of A in (34). Thus, we consider det(A) > 0,
which yields

or equivalently p = [ p1 p2 ]T ≥ A−1 y, where p01 and p02
are the intersecting point given in (33). Hence, the intersecting
point provides the minimum positive power pairs that satisfy
(51) and (52). If p01 and p02 satisfy the power constraint, E 0 is
feasible (Fig. 9.a). Otherwise, E 0 is infeasible (Fig. 9.b).
