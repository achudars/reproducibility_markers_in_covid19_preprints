Deltoid tangents with evenly distributed orientations and
random tilings
Juan Garcı́a Escudero
Abstract. We study the construction of substitution tilings of the plane based on certain simplicial
configurations of tangents of the deltoid with evenly distributed orientations. The random tiling
ensembles are obtained as a result of tile rearrangements in the substitution rules associated to
edge flips.

1. Introduction
Tiling theory developed from several directions in the last half century. Interested in problems of
logic, Wang [21] and Berger [1] produced in the 1960s non periodic tilings of the plane with a large
number of basic geometric shapes. Later Penrose generated a non periodic planar tiling by using a set
of two basic tiles [18]. The discovery of quasicrystals by Shechtman in the early 1980s [20] stimulated
the study of tilings with non crystallographic symmetries, because certain tilings underlie the atomic
structure of quasicrystals. Two main approaches to modelling the structure of quasicrystals are the
construction of cut and project sets, also called model sets, and the generation of substitution tilings.
Much progress has been done in the field of deterministic substitution tilings during the last decades,
but not in the construction of random tilings. We will consider the problem of the generation of tilings
by means of both deterministic and random substitutions.
In 1996 Nischke and Danzer provided a construction of substitution tilings based on the system
of certain d tangents of the deltoid, when d is odd, higher than 5 and non divisible by three [17]. In
recent papers we have shown that the sets of deltoid tangents with d evenly distributed orientations
are images under a certain map of periodic billiard trajectories inside the fundamental region of the
affine Weyl group of the root system A2 [8]. In some cases the arrangements of deltoid tangents
are simplicial, namely, all their bounded cells are triangles. Several sets of simplicial arrangements
corresponding to d odd and non divisible by 3 were used in [17] to produce tilings, although the
same sets were studied before with a different purpose [10]. In this paper we study a construction of
tilings by using deltoid tangents having any d > 4 evenly distributed orientations and we use them to
investigate the generation of random tilings for d even.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we study several properties of the simplicial arrangements of deltoid tangents with d evenly distributed orientations. They contain the prototiles, or
elementary triangles, and scaled copies of them necessary for the derivation of the inflation or substitution rules. The existence of deterministic substitution rules producing planar tilings is analysed
in Section 3. The relationship between algebraic numbers and mathematical quasicrystals was established first by Meyer in [15, 16] and later in [2]. Pisot-Vijayaraghavan (PV) numbers are real algebraic

integers with absolute value larger than one whose conjugates lie within the unit circle in the complex
plane. Most of the early studied tilings, including those found by Penrose and Ammann [13, 18], were
based upon inflation rules and have PV numbers as inflation factors. A significant feature of some
of the tilings obtained with the construction given in Section 3 is that many of the inflation factors
turn out to be PV numbers ([6], Table 1), which is of interest form the point of view of the diffraction
patterns produced when modelling physical quasicrystals with geometric tilings. Examples of tilings
associated with the simplicial arrangements corresponding to d = 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 have been analysed
in previous works (see [8] and references within) where we have shown that they contain vertex configurations with local rotational symmetry, a property not appearing in the tilings obtained with the
method employed in [17], as remarked in [11]. Although they are more complicated, to illustrate the
general results we include in this work some examples corresponding to d = 14. Section 4 is devoted
to the study of the existence of random tilings related with the introduction of tile rearrangements
in a given tiling or in the substitution rules. They are associated to edge flips in some quadrilaterals
formed by the union of two prototiles. It was treated for several special cases in [6, 7, 8] and we show
that these results can be generalised.

2. Simplicial arrangements of deltoid tangents with evenly distributed orientations
We consider the lines Ld,κ,ν (x, y) = 0, d = 5, 6..., κ ∈ {−2, 0, 2}, ν ∈ I (κ) , having parametric equations
x = x(t), y = y(t), where

which are defined ∀d if κ = 0 and for d = 3q, q = 2, 3, ... when κ = ∓2. The configuration corresponding
to d = 14 is represented in Fig.1, together with a superimposed heptagon which will be necessary in
Section 4 for the construction of random tilings.

segment Gν,d (the index ν is taken mod d) is |Gν,d | = 4 and the tangency point of Gν,d at the deltoid
D is z2(d−ν)+κ .
We use the following well-known results about congruences:
Proposition 2.1. If gcd(a, d) = 1, then the linear congruence ax ≡ b (mod d) has exactly one solution
modulo d.
By using Euclid’s algorithm it can be shown that if gcd(a, d) = m then there are two integers s
and t such that m = as + dt (Bézout’s identity). Therefore when m = 1, the solution of ax ≡ b (mod
d) is x = bs.
Proposition 2.2. If gcd(a, d) = m, then the congruence ax ≡ b (mod d) has a solution iff m|b. In that
case there are exactly m solutions modulo d which can be written as x1 , x1 + d1 , ..., x1 + (m − 1)d1 ,
where d = md1 and x1 is the solution of the congruence a1 x ≡ b1 (mod d1 ), a = ma1 , b = mb1 .

In what follows let d > 4. The case d = 5 has been studied in [7], where we have obtained the
minimal first cohomology for a quasicrystal tiling space (see [19] for an introduction to the study of
the cohomology of tiling spaces). Other cases have been treated in [6] and references therein.
The tilings we want to study have triangles as basic building blocks. Their edges lie on segments
G(ϕ), G(ψ) and G(χ).
Lemma 2.3. If 0 ≤ ϕ < χ < ψ < π and ω := ϕ + χ + ψ then
|G(ϕ) ∩ G(ψ) − G(ϕ) ∩ G(χ)| = 4|sinω| · sin(ψ − χ)

(2.5)

Proof. The point G(ϕ) ∩ G(ψ) is
p(ϕ, ψ) := (3 − 4(sin2 ϕ − sin2 ϕsin2 ψ + sin2 ψ + cosϕcosψsinϕsinψ), −4sinϕsinψsin(ϕ + ψ))

(2.6)

and
|p(ϕ, ψ) − p(ϕ, χ)| = 4|sin(ϕ + χ + ψ)|sin(ψ − χ)
(2.7)
A consequence of Eq. (2.7) is that if ϕ + χ + ψ ≡ 0 (mod π) then G(ϕ) ∩ G(χ) ∩ G(ψ) 6= ∅. 

point in Gµ,d for µ 6= 0, which corresponds to the left most point in Fig.2.c. This is a multiplicity
2 point, and we have a number of consecutive multiplicity 3 points pµ,qµ+1 = pµ,qµ−1 , pµ,qµ+2 =
pµ,qµ−2 , ...pµ,qµ+n−1 = pµ,qµ−n+1 until we reach a value of n such that either µq − n = µ or
µq + n = µ, namely, either µq + n = −2µ or µq − n = −2µ which corresponds to a point of
(0)
multiplicity 2 (the second point from the left in Fig.2.c). The remaining vertex points in Gµ,d are
pµ,qµ+n+1 = pµ,qµ−n−1 , pµ,qµ+n+2 = pµ,qµ−n−2 , ...pµ,qµ+q = pµ,qµ−q and have multiplicity 3. Now
|pµ,µq+l − pµ,µq+l−1 | = 4s2l−1 s1 and we get the sequence (Sn )n∈Iodd .

3. Substitution tilings of the plane
Definition 3.1. A tiling of an n-dimensional space S is a decomposition of S into a countable number
of n-cells T , called prototiles, such that S is the union of tiles and distinct tiles have non-intersecting
interiors. A collection of tiles, any two of which intersect only in their boundaries, is called a patch.
A substitution rule determines how to replace each prototile by a patch of tiles. Iteration of the
substitution rules gives in the limit a substitution tiling of S. In this work S is the real plane and the
prototiles are triangles (see [11, 14] for recent related work done with computer assistance where the
prototiles are triangles and rhombuses respectively).
In [17] the prototile edges are marked with arrows. Prototiles having the same shape but different
arrow decorations have different substitution rules. We use a procedure to distinguish prototiles having
the same shape that we call interior decoration, or ID for short. If two arrangements Xd , X2d satisfy
Xd ⊂ X2d then an elementary triangle t2d in X2d is inscribed in an elementary triangle td of Xd which
is a scaled copy of t2d . We decorate the interior of td with the inscribed copy t2d and the decorated
prototile is T = td ∪ t2d (see [8], Fig.2, p.105). The set of prototiles T is denoted by Fd . From the

or ∆d (µ − α, µ, µ + β). In this case d 6≡ 0 (mod 3), therefore by Prop. 2.2 there is no equilateral
triangle and we may assume γ 6= α, β. We look for solutions to the congruences µ ∓ β + µ + µ ± α ≡ σd
(mod d).
If α = β (isosceles triangle) then 3µ ≡ σd (mod d). If an elementary isosceles triangle has sides
(0)
Sa , Sb , Sb we now prove that the side Sa can be in Gµ,d for only two different values of µ. We have
to look for solutions of 3µ ≡ ±1 (mod d) and, according to Prop. 2.2 there is exactly one solution
in each case. The unique solution to 3µ ≡ 1 (mod d) is µ = 2l for d = 6l − 1 and µ = 4l + 1 for
d = 6l + 1. The solution to 3µ ≡ −1 (mod d) is µ = 4l − 1 for d = 6l − 1 and µ = 2l for d = 6l + 1.

3µ1 ≡ σd − α + β (mod d) with σd = −1 corresponding to ∆d (µ1 − β, µ1 , µ1 + α) then µ̄1 = µ1 − 2l

(κ)
of ∆d (µ1 − β, µ1 , µ1 + α) but with different ID. Also if ∆d (µ2 − α, µ2 , µ2 + β) corresponds to the

and if ∆d (µ2 − α, µ2 , µ2 + β) is associated to the solution of 3µ2 ≡ σd + α − β (mod d) with σd = −1

its congruent triangle is ∆d (µ2 − α − 2l − 2, µ2 − 2l − 2, µ2 + β − 2l − 2).

2) G∆,d , d = 3q. Now gcd(3, d) = 3 then 3µ ≡ ±1 (mod d) has no solution and we do not have

according to Prop.2.2, when α − β ∈ A = {−σd ± 3n}n=0,1,2,... and 3µ2 ≡ σd + α − β (mod d) has

(−2)
are µ = 2l + n, n = 0, q, 2q, the segment Gµ,d is subdivided into 3l + 1 segments and the number
of isosceles triangles is 9l + 1. The case κ = 2 can be studied in a similar way having in mind that
σd ∈ {1, 3}.
For α 6= β and κ = −2, the equation 3µ1 ≡ σd − α + β (mod d), with σd = −1 has solution
if β − α ∈ {3m + 1}m=1,2,3,... and 3µ2 ≡ σd + α − β (mod d) when β − α ∈ {3m − 1}m=1,2,3,... . In
both cases we have 3 solutions which correspond to the same prototile rotated by 2πn

Lemma 3.3. The edges of the inflated triangles with inflation factor ιd,l are subdivided according to
the sequences (Sl−j+1 , Sl−j+3 , ..., Sl+j−1 ) if 1 ≤ j ≤ l and (Sj−l+1 , Sj−l+3 , ..., Sj+l−1 ) if l + 1 ≤ j ≤

Eq. (3.1) can be obtained by induction on j. For j = 1 it is an identity. For j = 2 we have to
prove
sl s2 = s1 (sl−1 + sl+1 )
(3.3)
which is a consequence of the Mollweide´s formula and the law of sines. Now assuming it is true for
j − 2 then it is true for j because ss1l (sj − sj−2 ) = sl+j−1 + sl−j+1 . On the other hand, for j = 1, 2, ...q,
Pl−1
the identity ss1l sj = k=0 sj−l+2k+1 can be obtained also by induction on j. After cancelling terms
like sn + s−n we get it for j = 1. For j = 2 it is given by eq.(3.1). Now assuming it is true for j − 2
then it is true for j because ss1l (sj − sj−2 ) = sj+l−1 − sj−l−1 .
Therefore we have
ιd,l · 4s1 sj = 4s1 (sl−j+1 + sl−j+3 + ...sl+j−1 ), 1 ≤ j ≤ l

(3.4)

and
ιd,l · 4s1 sj = 4s1 (sj−l+1 + sj−l+3 + ...sj+l−1 ), l + 1 ≤ j ≤ q

We get a sequence (Sl−j+1 , Sl−j+3 , ..., Sl+j−1 ) if 1 ≤ j ≤ l and (Sj−l+1 , Sj−l+3 , ..., Sj+l−1 ) if l + 1 ≤
j ≤ q, and both represent a unique interval on every Gµ .

Proof. 1.1) G∆,d , d = 2q + 1, q 6= 3l + 1, l = 1, 2, 3.... If α = β then the solution to 3µ ≡ σd (mod d),
σd = 2, 3, ...q is µ = 2lσd for d = 6l − 1 and µ = (4l + 1)σd for d = 6l + 1. If α 6= β, given a solution
to 3µ1 ≡ σd − α + β (mod d) then µ̄1 = µ1 − (2l + 1)σd is a solution of 3µ̄1 ≡ −σd − α + β (mod d)
for d = 6l + 1 and µ̄1 = µ1 + (2l − 1)σd for d = 6l − 1 . We have the same results by replacing µ̄1 by
µ̄2 if we analyse 3µ̄2 ≡ σd + α − β.
(0)

1.2) G∆,d , d = 2q, q 6= 3l, l = 1, 2, 3.... If α = β then the solution to 3µ ≡ σd (mod d), σd = 2, 3, ...q
is µ = (2l + 1)σd for d = 6l + 2 and µ = (4l + 3)σd for d = 6l + 4. If α 6= β, given a solution to
3µ1 ≡ σd − α + β (mod d) then µ̄1 = µ1 + 2lσd is a solution of 3µ̄1 ≡ −σd − α + β (mod d) for d = 6l + 2
and µ̄1 = µ1 − (2l + 2)σd for d = 6l + 4. We have the same results if we analyse 3µ̄2 ≡ σd + α − β
(mod d).

that Sa∓1 < Sa±1 or Sa∓1 > Sa±1 respectively, and by Wν0 if Sa−1 = Sa+1 . We can get face-to-face
tilings with the property that the vertices of the inscribed triangles on the prototiles edges match.

We have seen that if there is an elementary triangle ∆ := ∆(Wνi1 , Wνj2 , Wνk3 ), i, j, k ∈ {−1, 0, 1}
e := ∆(Wν−i , Wν−j , Wν−k ). The mirror image of a word w = Wνi Wνj ...Wνk is

. We choose the tile dissections in such a way that the inflation rules for the edges of
1

n
e satisfy
∆ and ∆
φ(W i ) = M ir(ρ(φ(W −i )))
(3.12)
The common edges of two adjacent triangles are represented by W i , W −i . Therefore the fact that the
tilings are face-to-face is equivalent to P (φn (W i )) = M ir(P (φn (W −i ))), which is a consequence of
Eq.(3.12).
Example. The prototiles F, F̂ in Fig.3 have edges W3−1 , W5−1 , W6−1 corresponding to their subdivisions (S7 , S5 ), (S11 , S9 ), (S13 , S11 ) respectively. The edges of G are W4−1 , W5−1 , W5−1 with subdivisions
(S9 , S7 ), (S11 , S9 ), (S11 , S9 ). A solution to 3n ≡ p + 1 (mod 14) for p = 3 is n = 6. An edge inflation
rule corresponding to ι14,3 is
φ+ (W11 ) = W3−1 , φ+ (W21 ) = W4−1 W2−1 , φ+ (W31 ) = W5−1 W3−1 W1−1 , φ+ (W41 ) = W6−1 W4−1 W2−1 ,
φ+ (W51 ) = W70 W5−1 W3−1 , φ+ (W61 ) = W61 W6−1 W4−1 , φ+ (W70 ) = W51 W70 W5−1
In this case the words φ+ (Wνkn ) are not palindromic therefore we can define another edge inflation
rule by φ− (W i ) := φ+ (W −i ).

We have only given the prototile content in the substitutions rules. A more precise description can
be given in terms of formal languages as in [5, 7] and references within. The substitutions Φ14,3,+ (T )
for T = F, F̂ , G are represented in Fig.5.
Definition 3.6. By S(Fd ; Φd,p, ) ( = ±) we denote the set of all tilings P of the entire plane, where
every patch of P is congruent to some patch in some Φnd,p, (T ), with T ∈ Fd .

As a consequence of the previous results we have
Theorem 3.7. Assume d ∈ N, d > 4, p = 2, 3...b d2 c,  = ±. The set S(Fd ; Φd,p, ) is non empty. It
consists of tilings of the plane by tiles being congruent to members of Fd .
A vertex configuration is a patch where all the tiles have a vertex in common. In previous papers
we have studied several particular cases of the construction presented here (see a more exhaustive list
of references in [8]). In Fig.6 we show vertex configurations with rotational symmetry appearing in
the studied examples of tilings with inflation factors ι5,2 , ι8,3 , ι9,4 , ι10,3 , ι212,2 , which are PV numbers.
Example. For d = 14 we represent in Figs.7, 8 some patches of tilings with inflation factors ι14,3
and ι14,5 . A fragment of Φ314,3,+ (G) is shown in Fig.7 (left) and one of Φ514,3,− (G) in the same figure
(right). In Fig.8 we can see fragments corresponding to Φ314,5,+ (G) and Φ414,5,− (G) (ι14,5 is also a PV
number [6]).

4. Random tilings for d = 2q
Multiple different substitution rules defined on the same set of prototiles have been studied in [12,
17, 6, 11]. The method of composition of inflation rules, also called multisubstitutions, consists in
applying the same inflation rule to each tile in a given inflation step. In Fig.9 we can see parts of

(Φ14,3,+ Φ14,3,− )3 (G) and (Φ14,5,+ Φ14,5,− )2 (G). Also composition of substitution rules corresponding
to different inflation factors are possible as shown in Fig.10 for (Φ14,3,+ Φ14,5,+ )2 (G) and Fig. 11 for
(Φ14,5,− Φ14,3,+ )2 (G), where two different magnifications are used for the same fragment (ι14,3 ι14,5 is
a PV number [6]). In this section we treat the problem of the generation of random tilings by means
of prototile rearrangements.

Definition 4.1. If a quadrilateral  with diagonals Si , Sj is formed by the union of two elementary
triangles sharing Si , the tile rearrangement consists in replacing Si −→ Sj and  is now the union of
two different prototiles.
The set of prototiles without ID is denoted by F̄d .
Definition 4.2. The random tiling ensemble denoted by Rr (F̄d ; Φd,p, ) is the set of tilings obtained by
tile rearrangements in any member of S(Fd ; Φd,p, ).
(κ)

We construct, in the interior of G∆,2q , the regular polygon with vertices {pc,q+c }c=0,1,2,...,q−1 [7].
(κ)

Its edges have length 4s1 sq−1 and some of them may lie on a Gµ,2q (see Fig.1 for q = 7). The edge
(κ)

with vertices pc,q+c , pc+1,q+c+1 lie in some Gµ,2q for κ = 0 when 3c ≡ q − 1 (mod 2q) or 3c ≡ q − 2
(mod 2q), namely (c, µ) ∈ {(l, l + 1), (2l, 5l + 1)} if q = 3l + 1 and (c, µ) ∈ {(l, l), (2l + 1, 5l + 4)} if
q = 3l + 2. There is no solution for c when q = 3l if κ = 0. For κ = −2, c must be a solution of
3c ≡ q − 2 (mod 2q) or 3c ≡ q − 3 (mod 2q), therefore (c, µ) ∈ {(l − 1, l), (3l − 1, 3l), (5l − 1, 5l)} if
q = 3l.
(κ)
The sides not lying on a Gµ,2q define tile rearrangements in the substitution rules [6] associated
to edge flips Sq −→ Sq−1 . The set of substitution rules Φd,R := {Φd,1 , Φd,2 , ...Φd,k } is obtained by
considering all possible combinations of tile rearrangements in the inflated prototiles.
Random substitution tilings are characterised by the fact that one can apply at each inflation
step different substitution rules to each tile [5, 11].
Definition 4.3. Given a set of substitution rules Φd,R := {Φd,1 , Φd,2 , ...Φd,k }, we define the random
substitution tiling ensemble corresponding to a prototile set F, denoted by Rs (F; Φd,R ), as the set of
tilings constructed in such a way that one can apply to each tile and at each inflation step different
substitution rules belonging to Φd,R .
Theorem 4.4. Assume d = 2q ∈ N, q > 2. The sets Rr (F̄d ; Φd,p, ) and Rs (F̄d ; Φd,R ), with prototiles
congruent to members of F̄d , are non-empty. The inflation factor associated with Rs (F̄d ; Φd,R ) is ιd,q .
Proof. 1) κ = 0, q = 3l + 1: each pair of consecutive polygon vertices pl+a,4l+a+1 , pl+a+1,4l+a+2 define
(0)
a quadrilateral  in G∆,2q which is the union of two adjacent prototiles:

We introduce edge flips consisting in replacing the common edge of the prototiles by the polygon edge
when a ∈ {1, 2, ..., l − 1, l + 1, ..., 3l} which produces a prototile rearrangement. We denote by ∆0 a
(κ)
triangle not belonging to G∆,2q but congruent to some prototile and by µ0 the index of a segment
(κ)

(κ)

parallel to Gµ,2q not belonging to G∆,2q . After the edge flip we have

6l+2 (l+a, 4l+a+1; l+a+1, 4l+a+2) = ∆0 (l+a, 4l+a+2, (l+4a+1)0 )∪∆0 (4l+a+1, l+a+1, (l+4a+1)0 )

An edge flip for a ∈ {1, 2, ..., 3l − 1} gives
(0)

6l (l + a, 4l + a; l + a + 1, 4l + a + 1) = ∆0 (4l + a, l + a + 1, (l + 4a + 2)0 ) ∪ ∆0 (4l + a, l + a + 1, (l + 4a + 2)0 )

In this case we do not have congruent prototiles ∆6l (λ, µ, ν) inside G∆,6l with, for instance, σ6l = 1,
because 3µ ≡ −3a + 1 (mod 6l) has no solution. They are congruent to elementary triangles with

σ6l = −3 which belong to G∆,6l : ∆0 (4l + a, l + a + 1, (l + 4a + 2)0 ) ∼

An edge flip for a ∈ {1, 2, ..., l − 1, l + 1, ..., 2l − 1, 2l + 1, ..., 3l − 1} gives
(−2)

(l + a − 1, 4l + a − 1; l + a, 4l + a) = ∆0 (l + a − 1, 4l + a, (l + 4a)0 ) ∪ ∆0 (l + a, 4l + a − 1, (l + 4a)0 )

with ∆0 (l + a − 1, 4l + a, (l + 4a)0 ) ∼

=
(−2)
∆6l (5l − a, 2l − a − 1, 5l + 2a). If we change the signs we get a similar result for the edge flips in
(2)
G∆,6l .
In Rr (F̄d ; Φd,p, ), where the tilings are obtained by tile rearrangements in a deterministic tiling,
we have random tilings associated with all inflation factors. For Rs (F̄d ; Φd,R ), with d = 2q, if the
inflation factor is ιd,q , then in the sequence
(−2)

(Sq−j+1 , Sq−j+3 , ..., Sq+j−1 ), 1 ≤ j ≤ q
we have
Sq+j−1 = Sd−(q+j−1) = Sq−j+1 , Sq+j−3 = Sd−(q+j−3) = Sq−j+3 , ...
and therefore the sequence is palindromic. Now the ID is not needed to get face to face substitution
tilings [6]. In order to produce face to face tilings with other inflation factors, combinations of several
substitutions must be considered (see [8], Figs.6,7 for d = 5, 9).

flips corresponding to the tile rearrangements are represented by a thicker segment, as in Fig.1.
It is possible to describe the random tilings in terms of formal grammars along the lines of [7].
In that approach the elements of the alphabet are letters representing the prototiles and the set of
production rules H in the language would correspond in this case to the set of substitution rules Φd,R ,
having in mind the orientation of the prototiles. For non-deterministic structures one has to introduce
a function π : H 7→ (0, 1], called the probability distribution, which maps the set of production rules
into the set of production probabilities. A question that deserves further study is the role played by
the choice of π in the analysis of diffraction patterns, phase transitions and other properties of the
associated structures (see also [4] for a recent application of weighted context-free grammars in a
different domain).
