Abstract—This paper proposes a scientifically reasonable
polarization mode dispersion (PMD) emulator (PMDE) for
coherent optical fiber transmission.
Guidelines are physically correct modeling of the
polarization-dispersive fiber, the time-variable polarization
transformations occurring in there, including emulation of
polarization events caused by lightning strikes, the adoption of
acceptable compromise to keep implementation cost low enough
and competitive industrial basis for production of such PMDE.
We propse a PMDE consisting of N differential group delay
(DGD) sections placed between N+1 time-variable general
retarders or polarization scramblers. These should be general
elliptical retarders, capable of changing polarization with rates
up to 20 Mrad/s on the Poincaré sphere. That should include
bursts of polarization rotations forth and back at up to 20
Mrad/s. The DGD sections can be fixed or variable and should
be able to constitute a total PMD of alternatively, say, 20 ps, 50
ps, 100 ps, 200 ps, or another set of various discrete values. We
propose even N and equal individual DGDs, which allows the
total PMDE to assume a neutral state without any PMD of
whatever order. Number N may be chosen relatively small; N =
2 seems acceptable. A variety of component and subsystem
suppliers is available, and the proposed PMDE is available on
the market.

I. INTRODUCTION
The dominance of coherent optical polarization division
multiplex transmission on amplified fiber lines, usually with
non-negligible polarization mode dispersion (PMD) [1], and
the observed occurrence of fast polarization transformation
changes, namely due to lightning strikes, make it advisable or
necessary to standardize polarization mode dispersion
emulators (PMDE). We review available knowledge in this
area and propose structure as well as properties to be
implemented for such PMDEs.
II. MODELING OF PMD
The existence of first-order polarization mode dispersion
was laid out in 1986 by Poole and Wagner [1]. They found that
there exist two principal states of polarization (PSP) with
maximum and minimum group delay, hence a differential
group delay (DGD). They derived this by showing that, upon
application of a PSP at the fiber input, the output polarization
does, to first order, not vary as a function of frequency. PSPs
were given as Jones vectors.
If the PSPs are constant along the fiber which accumulates
DGD then it may be called a DGD section. Polarization-

maintaining fibers (PMF) or other highly birefringent devices
such as Z-cut LiNbO3 waveguides are (quasi-)ideal DGD
sections.
In 1999 one of us showed that the small-signal intensity
modulation transfer function yields minimum and maximum
group delays when the PSPs are launched [2], and PMD can
be entirely derived from there. The PSPs were expressed as
normalized Stokes vectors. This makes sense because by that
time it had been recognized in the scientific community that
total first-order PMD of 2 DGD sections can be calculated by
the law of cosines, i.e. through a vectorial addition of the two
individual PMD vectors. We pointed out [2] (in a slightly
different nomenclature) that this can be generalized to an
arbitrary number of DGD sections,

~
Here  is the overall, total input-referred PMD vector,
~
 i are the individual input-referred PMD vectors of the
various DGD sections, and G j (with T = transpose) are the
rotation matrices of all retarders preceding DGD section i,
including preceding DGD sections. In each case, the (total or
~
individual) DGD equals the length of a PMD vector (  or
~
 i ). A proof of the PMD vector concatenation rule is laid out
in [3 (p. 96)].
~
The  i can be graphically concatenated in a PMD or
DGD profile [2] which visualizes PMD in the normalized
Stokes space that is scaled in temporal DGD units (typically
in ps). An exemplary DGD profile is shown in Fig. 1 top.
In 1991, Foschini and Poole [4] have expanded the overall
PMD vector by a Taylor series in the frequency domain,

This eqn. (2) has dominated the discussion of higher-order
PMD ever since, with probably >100 papers written about it.
However, the truncated Taylor expansion of the PMD vector
is unphysical: Far off the considered optical angular frequency
 0 (which usually is the carrier frequency) it inevitably
~
predicts      , hence an infinite overall DGD. This is
incompatible with the reasonable assumption that at all
angular frequencies  the expected DGD as well as the
maximum DGD are similar or even identical (though this
occurs at different times or for different fiber temperatures
etc.).
The DGD sections and retarders which physically model
the transmission line create a quasi-periodic trajectory of the
total PMD vector in the Stokes space (that is scaled in DGD
units). It is well known that a Taylor series is a very bad choice
for the modeling of a periodic or quasi-periodic function!
An alternative to the unphysical representation of PMD by
(2) is the usage of a finite number of DGD sections. PMD
compensators have been built this way [5–7]. In [5, 6, 7] the
number N of DGD sections was 3, 32 and 123, respectively.
The latter large N suggests the usage of, or rather is, a DGD
profile which is a rod that can be bent. In [8], PMD modeling
by a DGD profile that can be bent has been numerically tested
against the Taylor expansion (2), with the same number of
degrees-of-freedom (DOF). Of course the bent DGD profile
outperforms the Taylor expansion by far, in terms of modeling
accuracy. A sequence of DGD sections is similar to the bent
DGD profile but is much easier realized with off-the-shelf
components. Also, with a sequence of sections whose DGDs
can be changed one is not restricted to a fixed total DGD like
in [6, 7].
For the standardization of a PMD emulator we strongly
recommend a finite sequence of N DGD sections, placed
between N+1 retarders SCR (= polarization scramblers), see
Fig. 1 bottom. The scrambler eigenmodes and retardations
determine the angles between subsequent DGD sections.
III. NUMBER OF RETARDERS AND DGD SECTIONS
In the old days of intensity modulation, no polarization
transformer or retarder was needed between transmitter (TX)
and receiver (RX) as long as there was no PMD.
For coherent transmission which is inherently
polarization-sensitive, a retarder between TX and RX is
needed to model the fiber, even in the absence of PMD. This
retarder and all retarders between which DGD sections are
placed should be time-variable.
For emulation (or compensation) of just first-order PMD,
one DGD section and another time-variable retarder must be
added before the RX. This is in agreement with early 1st-order
PMD compensators (which needed no second retarder right
before the RX because the RX was polarization-insensitive).
From Section II. it is clear that a large N would be best. In
practice, cost limits the permissible number N+1 of timevariable retarders. Fortunately it is also technically reasonable
to work with a fairly limited number N+1 of retarders:

2

Firstly, strong/frequent/fast polarization fluctuations can
sometimes be generated at specific places (such as bridges,
exchange offices). This is taken into account by our model [2]
with limited number N of DGD sections. Other researchers
have come to the same conclusion and have called this a hinge
model of PMD [9–12].
Secondly, large PMD is more difficult to equalize in the
coherent RX than small PMD. Furthermore, beyond a certain
amount of DGD the coherent RX will not be able to
follow/track/equalize anyway. So, a Maxwellian DGD
distribution with infinite tails is not needed. Rather it suffices
to find that amount of PMD which is still tolerable. Then one
knows that more than this cannot be tolerated, no matter how
frequently or rarely that occurs. Since a DGD distribution tail
of infinite length is not needed, a finite total DGD suffices.
Such can be generated with a limited number N of DGD
sections. Of course higher order PMD effects get weaker when
the DGD sections must form a larger overall DGD, but the
same holds (though usually to less degree) also in the fiber
whose PMD is emulated.
Already N = 2 cascaded DGD sections require an infinite
Taylor series for exact modeling but as mentioned above the
Taylor expansion of the PMD vector is unphysical anyway.
The important thing is that 2 or more cascaded DGD sections
generate PMD which is not limited to 1st order.
The larger N, the better. But already N = 2 (Fig. 2 top)
seems to be a good choice, also due to cost reasons.
One may consider to use the PMDE in both directions,
thereby effectively doubling available 1st order PMD. This
would require 2 circulators (Fig. 2 bottom). However, since
the available number of DOF does not increase the result is not
expected to be as good as that which one could expect from a
PMDE with 2N sections.

IV. TYPE AND SPEED OF TIME-VARIABLE RETARDERS
Each time-variable retarder is a polarization scrambler. A
general elliptical retarder has 3 DOF, for example azimuth
angle and elevation angle of one eigenmode and the
retardation. According to [2], only one retarder in a PMDE
must be an elliptical retarder, for instance the last one
(index N). In that case it suffices for the others (indices
0...N–1) that they be able to endlessly transform any input
polarization into a PSP of the following DGD section. While
such retarders need only 2 DOF it is usually too complicated
to implement them with just the right 2 DOF. This holds all
the more since between retarder and subsequent DGD section
there can, in praxis, be an unknown polarization
transformation. Hence we recommend that all time-variable
retarders/scramblers of the PMDE preferably be general
elliptical retarders with 3 DOF and endless polarization
transformation properties.
To generate the recommended needed 3 DOF, more DOF
are generally needed in practice. 4 or more rotating

Document PMDE2019_Paderborn_Univ_Novoptel_n12.docx, 12 March 2019
waveplates, such as quarterwave plates (QWP), are likely to
be an adequate choice.
It is also possible to use fiber squeezers or equivalent
technologies of retarders with fixed eigenmodes. However, it
is difficult to make them fulfill the requirement that they be
able to endlessly transform any input polarization into a PSP
of the following DGD section. In particular, for reliable
operation this usually requires fiber squeezers with calibrated
retardation (i.e. temperature- and ageing-insensitive offset)
[13], which is easily achieved if the actuators are magnets, but
not if the actuators are piezos.
More in detail, to prove endless polarization
transformation capability of a polarization transformer one
must be able to operate it as an endless controller/tracker with
quantifiable low outage probability at the highest possible
speed. Examples are given in [14]: Relative intensity error
0.45% is surpassed with probability of 10–10 when tracking 40
krad/s. Relative intensity error 1.2% is surpassed with
probability of 10–12 when tracking 100 krad/s. Note that this
does not preclude endless polarization scrambling up to very
much higher speeds, typically 2...3 orders of magnitude
higher, mainly because the delay by the accurate search
algorithm and feedback is avoided.
In [15], fiber polarization fluctuations due to lightning
strikes with speeds up to 5.1 Mrad/s have been observed. This
study is very valuable for the estimation of the needed timevariance of the retarders in the PMDE. There is no proof that
no stronger lightning strikes can occur, nor that they cannot
take place at worse positions (i.e. nearer to the fiber).
The time-variable retarder should be able to replicate the
polarization fluctuations caused by lightning strikes. Since
they may be large, an endless polarization change is needed.
That can be generated by phase shifters with infinite
retardation, which unfortunately do not exist, or by rotating
waveplates, namely a rotating halfwave plate (HWP). A
rotating HWP behaves like a variable circular retarder
cascaded with a HWP at fixed position. It happens that circular
retardation indeed coincides with the Faraday effect in fiber,
caused by the magnetic field that is generated by a lightning
strike.
In order to cover the range of observed polarization
changing speeds with some headroom, a scrambling speed of
20 Mrad/s seems adequate. If faster polarization changes in
fiber should be observed this value may need to be revised
upward. This would be possible, given that 50 Mrad/s
polarization scramblers are on the market [16].
A fast rotating HWP which dominates the scrambling
speed distribution can be beneficial [17]: There a polarization
tracking system was tested roughly 50 times faster than with a
Rayleigh-like speed distribution. This is considered as a
tremendous advantage in the PMDE process, given that most
likely only certain combinations of the N+1 scrambler speeds
and positions will cause worst performance in coherent
transmission links. Of course the various HWP and other
waveplate rotation speeds should all be incommensurate.
In agreement with the above one retarder/scrambler
waveplate should be a HWP which can rotate fast to scramble
polarization at up to 20 Mrad/s. Since the orientation of the
HWP rotations with respect to the PSPs of the DGD sections
should be restricted as little as possible, one or better more

integrated in one packaged, commercially available LiNbO3 chip.

waveplates (such as QWP) should be placed before and behind
the HWP. One possible embodiment is shown in Fig. 3. It has
the additional advantage that the relatively large total number
of 7 waveplates makes it easier to achieve a Rayleigh-like
speed distribution if this is desired.
The endless scrambling of the HWP should include
definable bursts of forth/back rotation up to ±20 Mrad/s.
V. TYPE AND DGD RANGE OF DGD SECTIONS
Each transponder or coherent RX manufacturer knows
how much DGD the DSP can equalize. Therefore he can tell
the tester how large the total DGD should be chosen. Each
individual DGD can then be chosen as the total DGD divided
by N. For instance, assuming 2.5 ps/m of DGD in PMF, a total
DGD of 250 ps can be achieved with N = 2 DGD sections,

0 ps ……………….... 52 ps of first-order PMD
Retardation change 20000
Fig. 4. Top: Transmission span containing 2 sections with 26 of DGD each

capable of a π retardation change. Bottom: Pure DGD vector lengthening is
extremely unlikely to happen in a transmission span.

each with a DGD of 125 ps and length of 50 m.
It has been detailed in [2] that an increase of total DGD is
essentially not due to DGD sections changing their delay. If,
for example, there are 2 sections with 26 ps of DGD each, a
retardation change from π to 0 of a mode converter in between
the sections change the total DGD from 0 ps to 52 ps (Fig. 4).
In contrast, changing the DGD of a single DGD section from
0 ps to 52 ps needs about 20000ꞏπ, i.e. a 20000 times larger
retardation change. Of course the smaller retardation change
of π is many, many orders of magnitude more likely and will
be decisive for all at least all non-minuscule changes of total
DGD.
Since a certain range of total DGDs is to be covered by a
very small number of DGD sections, maybe as few as N = 2
due to cost of the N+1 time-variable retarders/scramblers, one
should consider changing the range of total covered DGD by
changing the section DGDs, be it
 by PMF replacements,
 by optical switches, in particular optomechanical switches,

Document PMDE2019_Paderborn_Univ_Novoptel_n12.docx, 12 March 2019
 by variable DGD sections.

Variable DGD elements are a versatile alternative to fixed
DGD sections. If DSP tracking speed in the coherent receiver
were slow, retardation changes of DGD in variable sections
due thermal or wavelength drift alone could already be a
challenge to the DSP. But given that DSP is very fast anyway,
variable DGD sections can be tolerated.
A delay line alone is not a DGD section. Rather, 2
polarization beamsplitters/combiners are also needed. This
increases cost somewhat and may introduce PDL.
It seems reasonable that it should be possible to achieve a
neutral PMDE which no PMD or DGD whatsoever. A
convenient implementation is it to choose an even N with a
symmetric distribution of section DGDs. This way the
innermost sections N/2, N/2+1 can compensate each other,
likewise the sections N/2–1, N/2+2, ... , ..., 1, N. We propose
to make all section DGDs identical, with even N. Maximum
total and first-order PMD/DGD is simply N times section
DGD.
In order to leave it open whether DGD sections are fixed
or variable, a variety of total DGD values should be specified.
Example: 20 ps, 50 ps, 100 ps, 200 ps. Finer granularity biases
the engineering implementations toward usage of variable
DGD sections, due to cost reasons.
One day it may become interesting to emulate not only
distributed PMD but also distributed PDL. The proposed
PMDE can easily be enhanced this way. See Section III. of
[18] where a distributed DGD+PDL model is presented.
VI. AVAILABILITY OF COMPONENTS AND SUBSYSTEMS
LiNbO3 polarization transformers with up to 8 waveplates
are available from EOSPACE since many years [19] and they
are recently also being manufactured by Fiberpro [20]. A
shortage of such devices is therefore not to be expected, and
competition will keep component prices reasonable.
Manufacturers of polarization scramblers or time-variable
retarders with such LiNbO3 polarization transformers are
seemingly (in lexical order) Keysight [21], New Ridge
Technologies [22], Novoptel [23] and Viavi [24]. Maximum
scrambling speed 20 Mrad/s [23] or even 50 Mrad/s [16] is
available from Novoptel. As far as not all manufacturers
currently offer the proposed maximum scrambling speed of 20
Mrad/s and have a satisfying number of waveplates (7 in [23])
it is to be assumed that they can implement adequate changes
to achieve this, given that the same LiNbO3 polarization
transformers are available for everyone.

these are constructed of DGD sections as needed for physical
modeling.
From the above it is clear that existing competition can
always guarantee availability of the proposed PMDE at
reasonable cost.
VII. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PMDE IN LONGRANGE, HIGH-END COHERENT TRANSMISSION
For the implementation of high-end PMDE we
recommend:
 N DGD sections placed between N+1 time-variable
retarders/scramblers should be used to emulate PMD. The
larger N, the better, but N = 2 is already an acceptable
choice.
 Even N with equal section DGDs is recommended because
it includes the possibility of having a neutral PMDE.
 A variety of total DGD (= 1st order PMD) values should
be specified, say 20 ps, 50 ps, 100 ps, 200 ps, in order to
keep the choice between variable and fixed DGD sections
open.
 The scramblers should be elliptical retarders, capable of
endless polarization transformations with speeds up to 20
Mrad/s, including definable forth/back rotations up to that
speed with arbitrarily adjustable orientation.

The PMDEs can be supplied as complete units, or in parts,
namely time-variable retarders/scramblers and DGD sections,
from different or identical vendors.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PMDE IN COHERENT 80 KM ZR
LINK

In a coherent 80 km ZR link [29] the boundary conditions
are 10 ps mean DGD and 50 krad/s maximum scrambling
speed. For the implementation of a PMDE we recommend:
 2 DGD sections placed between 3 time-variable
retarders/scramblers seem acceptable.
 DGD per section equals total maximum DGD (e.g. 3 times
mean DGD, hence 30 ps) divided by N (hence 15 ps).
 The scramblers should be elliptical retarders, capable of
endless polarization transformations with speeds up to 50
krad/s.

For those testers who also expect to need a PMDE for longrange, high-end coherent transmission it may prove most costeffective to choose a model that fulfills, or can be modified to
fulfill, the higher requirements of Section VII.
IX. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

PMF for fixed DGD sections and optomechanical switches
to switch between DGD sections of different lengths are
available from a number of vendors at competitive prices. Any
vendor of polarization scramblers can integrate them into his
boxes.

We thank Dr. Bo Zhang (Inphi Corp.) for suggesting the
writing of this text and for very helpful discussions on this
topic.

Such a complete PMDE with 20 Mrad/s polarization
scramblers and switchable DGD sections (internal, but also
external ones) is available from Novoptel [25].
