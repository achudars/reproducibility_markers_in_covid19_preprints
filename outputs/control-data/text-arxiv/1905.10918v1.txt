The 2-neutrino exchange potential is a Standard-Model weak potential arising
from the exchange of virtual neutrino–antineutrino pairs which must include
all neutrino properties, including the number of flavors, their masses, fermionic
nature (Dirac or Majorana), and CP violation. We describe a new approach
for calculating the spin-independent 2-neutrino exchange potential, including
the mixing of three neutrino mass states and CP violation.

The neutrino sector of the Standard Model (SM) holds great potential for
revealing new physics. Interestingly, the unsolved problems of neutrino
physics [e.g., the masses of the three neutrino mass states, the neutrino’s
fermionic nature (Dirac or Majorana), number of flavors, existence of sterile
neutrinos and CP violation] all impact the 2-neutrino exchange potential
(2-NEP), the weak interaction force arising from the exchange of virtual
neutrino–antineutrino pairs. The formulas for the single neutrino flavor 2NEP were first derived by Feinberg and Sucher 1 and Fischbach 2 assuming
massless and massive neutrinos, respectively. A number of other authors
have also investigated the 2-NEP. 3–5 Lusignoli and Petrarca 6 developed an
integral formula for the 2-NEP with mixing of three neutrino flavors, but
did not include all of the electroweak contributions. Here, we describe a
new derivation of the 2-NEP with mixing that incorporates neutral-current
(NC) and charged-current (CC) weak interactions and CP violation, and
discuss the possibilities of using the 2-NEP as a probe of neutrino physics. 7
In our approach for calculating the 2-NEP, we express the neutrino
fields in the Schrödinger picture and then use time-independent perturbation theory to calculate the second-order energy shift of the neutrino-field
vacuum energy due to the presence of two stationary fermions. We ignore

infinite self-energy corrections, which only depend on the positions of a
single fermion. The spin-independent contribution, which depends on the
separation distance r, is finite, and for the single-flavor case involving NC
weak interactions is found to be given by 7

where GF is the Fermi constant, gV is the vector coupling constant, mν is

To incorporate mixing, we write the three flavor fields να (~r), (α =
e, µ, τ ) as linear combinations of the three mass fields νa (~r), (a = 1, 2, 3),

i.e., να (~r) ≡ a=1 Uαa νa (~r), where Uαa are components of the Pontecorvo–

Here, sab = sin θab , cab = cos θab , and δCP is the CP-violation phase. For
the purpose of our calculation, we note that nucleons interact with the neutrino only via NC interactions, while leptons also require the inclusion of
CC interactions. We will therefore need to consider three cases for the interaction potentials: nucleon–nucleon, nucleon–lepton, and lepton–lepton.
The 2-NEP between nucleons is the simplest since the NC current interaction is independent of neutrino flavor. For nucleons #1 and #2, we
merely sum Eq. (1) over the three mass states, which gives 7

where N = proton or neutron, gVN = 12 − 2 sin2 θW for protons and gVN = − 21
for neutrons, where θW is the Weinberg angle. The magnitude of this
interaction is quite small. For two neutrons, the gravitational force is larger
than the 2-NEP force when r & 1 nm.
For the case of a nucleon interacting with a lepton, one finds a result
similar to the nucleon–nucleon potential except for a change of the lepton
vector coupling, which depends on the PMNS matrix element corresponding
to the lepton flavor,

The final case, the lepton–lepton 2-NEP, is the most interesting since the
mixing has the greatest impact on the form of the potential and it involves
both NC and CC interactions, but we were unable to obtain a closed-form
expression if all the masses are nonzero. Instead, for two lepton flavors

The lepton–lepton 2-NEP is particularly interesting because of its dependence on the CP-violating phase δCP . Presently, there is growing evidence 8
that δCP 6= 0. We show that one can write 7

(r) are complicated functions of r independent of

δCP , and
interaction between two electrons, the 2-NEP potential will depend on the
CP-violating phase due to the interference of the PMNS matrix elements.
While the original study of 2-NEP arose mainly out of theoretical interests, our results raise the possibility of opening new avenues for experimental explorations of basic neutrino parameters. Because the 2-NEP
involves the exchange of virtual neutrinos, all neutrino properties and energies must contribute. Besides being sensitive to the mixing angles, the
2-NEP depends directly on the actual neutrino masses, not the difference
in mass squared as in neutrino-oscillation experiments. If we assume the
neutrino mass spectrum lies in the range 1 meV . mν . 1 eV, the most
promising experiments need to focus on the corresponding separations 1 nm

. r . 1 µm. The dependence of the 2-NEP on CP violation is also novel,
the only long-range SM force with this property. Muonium is the natural
system to explore these effects since the 2-NEP CP violation requires interactions between leptons other than between just electrons. In addition, as
pointed out by Fischbach et al., the contribution of the 2-NEP to the nuclear binding energy provides an interesting test of the WEP as applied to
neutrinos. 9 Of course, the experimental challenges in realizing these possibilities are significant, requiring measuring forces of less than gravitational
strength on the nanometer scale or the Weak Equivalence Principle at the
level of ∼ 10−17 . Recently, Stadnik 5 examined the potential of using highprecision spectroscopy, although some of the assumptions made may be
overly optimistic. 10
This work only touches on some of the interesting questions raised by the
2-NEP. We assumed neutrinos were Dirac fermions, examined only the spinindependent interaction, and assumed the simplest neutrino vacuum state.
Alternatives to these assumptions and others involving theories beyond the
SM will certainly impact the 2-NEP, providing new directions for theoretical
and experimental exploration.
