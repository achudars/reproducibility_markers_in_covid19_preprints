ABSTRACT

Recent observations made by the Rosetta/ROSINA instrument have detected molecular oxygen in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with abundances at
the 1-10% level relative to H2 O. Previous studies have indicated that the likely origin of the O2 may be surface chemistry of primordial (dark cloud) origin, requiring
somewhat warmer, denser and extreme H-atom poor conditions than are usually assumed. In this study we propose a primordial gas-phase origin for the O2 which is
subsequently frozen and effectively hidden until the ice mantles are sublimated in the
comet’s coma. Our study presents results from a three-phase astrochemical model that
simulates the chemical evolution of ices in the primordial dark cloud phase, its gravitational collapse, and evolution in the early protosolar nebula. We find that the O2
abundance can be produced and is fairly robust to the choice of the free parameters.
Good matches for the O2 :H2 O ratio and, to a lesser extent, the N2 :CO and CO:H2 O
ratios are obtained, but the models significantly over-produce N2 . We speculate that
the low value of N2 :O2 that is observed is a consequence of the specific thermal history
of the comet.

INTRODUCTION

Comets are believed to be among the most primitive objects in the Solar System and potentially carry within
them the chemical signatures of molecular clouds from
which the nascent protosolar nebula (PSN) formed. However, cometary material and ices may be created by and
subject to a wide variety of chemical processing mechanisms
including; chemistry in the molecular cloud as well as the
PSN, solid-state chemistry in or on the ices, heating by collisions as well as internal radiogenic heating, surface radiation
processing by impacting high energy particles (radiolysis),
condensation/sublimation and the effects of Solar irradiation (photolysis).
Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter referred to as comet 67P/C-G) is a Jupiter-family comet,
which is thought to have originated from the transNeptunian Kuiper belt, but has been perturbed by a close
encounter with Jupiter (in 1959) into an inner Solar-System
orbit (Maquet 2015). These comets do not form a homogenous class and significant chemical variations exist; for example the D/H ratio in 67P/C-G is > 3× larger than in

other Jupiter-family comets, such as Hartley 2, Balsiger et
al. (2015), and the orbits/dynamical histories may be quite
different (e.g. 67P/C-G has had just 10 apparitions in its
present orbit, whilst the short-period comet P/Halley has
had >2000 apparitions, Hughes 1985).
Comet 67P/C-G has merited detailed attention in the
wake of the Rosetta mission. This yielded many interesting and unexpected results, not least the realisation that
comets of this type cannot be represented by ‘dirty snowballs’ as previously thought, but are essentially ‘dry’ with
ices and volatiles amounting to 615% of the cometary mass,
embedded within a rocky matrix (Fulle et al. 2016). The outgassing from the comets is believed to be characterised by
the sublimation of successive layers of ancient icy material
(in onion-skin fashion) in the vicinity of perihelion on each
orbit (Guilbert-Lepoutre et al. 2015).
One of the many intriguing results from the Rosetta
mission has been the discovery of a larger-than-expected
abundance of molecular oxygen (O2 ) in the cometary coma.
Cometary gases are typically primarily composed of H2 O,
CO and CO2 with small traces of other atomic and molecular species (Bockelée-Morvan et al. 2004). However, the
ROSINA-DFMS device (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for
Ion and Neutral Analysis - Double Focusing Mass Spectrom-

eter) determined the presence of O2 at the 1-10% level relative to H2 O, with a mean value of ∼ 3.80%; significantly
larger than the gas-phase values determined for interstellar
dark clouds and protostellar sources (e.g. O2 :H2 O< 6×10−9
in NGC1333-IRAS4A, Yildiz et al. 2013). This is well below
the observational upper limits of 15% and 39% for O2 :H2 O
in the interstellar ices associated with low and high starforming regions, respectively (Boogert, Gerakines & Whittet
2015), although it is interesting to note that the O2 :CH3 OH
ratio in the warm (sublimated) gas of IRAS 16293-2422 is
lower than that in 67P/C-G (Taquet et al. 2018). Moreover, the O2 appears to be distributed isotropically and the
O2 :H2 O ratio is not obviously correlated to the heliocentric
distance of the comet. Nor is the O2 well-correlated with
N2 and CO, molecules of similar volatility/binding energy
(Bieler et al. 2015).
This suggests that the O2 permeates the cometary ice to
some depth and is not merely confined to the surface layers.
It has been shown that erosion of 67P/C-G causes loses of
metres to tens of metres of material per apparition (Keller
et al. 2015) so that in its 10 orbits, 67P/C-G will have lost
surface material up to depths of hundreds of metres.
Studies based on the structure, morphology and composition of 67P/C-G indicate that is essentially a ‘primordial rubble pile’ formed by the agglomeration of material in
the protosolar nebula that remained after the formation of
trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) as opposed to ‘collisional
rubble piles’ formed as a result of the disruption of larger
parent bodies (Weissman, Asphaug & Lowry 2004; Davidsson et al. 2016). The comet is thus believed to have grown
slowly at very low temperatures, from aged material in the
inner Solar System, and avoided thermal processing by the
decay of short-lived radionuclides (e.g. 26 Al) or collisional
processing - that would otherwise lead to a loss of the volatile
species, such as CO, CO2 and O2 . This agglomeration could
have been hierarchical (Davidsson et al. 2016; Bentley et
al. 2016), or even just via a gentle assembly of mm-sized
‘pebbles’ and ices (Blum et al. 2017). Moreover, the bi-lobe
structure of 67P/C-G probably resulted from a very low velocity (<1ms−1 ) collision (Massironi, et al. 2015; Blum et
al. 2017) and that collision possibly occurred within the last
1Gy (Jutzi et al. 2016).
As the significance of the delivery of cometary H2 O to
terrestrial oceans continues to be debated (Altwegg et al.
2015; Willacy et al. 2015), we need to understand the origin
and evolution of the cometary ices. It is possible that ratios
of simple molecular species, such as O2 :H2 O, can provide
us with information about the chemical and physical conditions in which comets were formed. Importantly, following
the detection of the higher than expected O2 abundance
in 67P/C-G, Giotto/Neutral Mass Spectrometer data of the
coma of Oort Cloud comet 1P/Halley have been re-analysed
and an O2 abundance of 3.7 ± 1.7 % with respect to H2 O
was found (Rubin, Altwegg, van Dishoeck & Schwehm 2015),
making O2 the third most abundant species in the coma. The
datasets do not compare like for like (the 67P/C-G/ROSINA
observations comprise a time-integrated dataset, whilst the
Giotto/NMS data is a 4 hour snapsot), but these remarkably
similar O2 abundances seen in comets with different dynamical histories may add weight to the theory that the O2 is
of a primordial (pre-PSN) origin and has survived the expected bulk thermal processing (sublimation, freezing, and

re-accretion onto the comet). Whilst the O2 abundances are
nearly identical, the situation for other molecular species is
more complex; e.g.the abundances of methanol (CH3 OH)
and carbon disulfide (CS2 ) are very different - both species
being significantly more abundant in 1P/Halley (see Table 3
of Rubin, Altwegg, van Dishoeck & Schwehm 2015). There
is an interesting corollary to this; if O2 is universally abundant in comets then the rate of its delivery to the early atmosphere of the Earth should be correlated to that of H2 O.
The fact that there is little evidence of pre-biogenic O2 in
the atmosphere of the Earth could be seen as mitigating evidence against the delivery of significant H2 O to Earth by
comets.
In addition to O2 , molecular nitrogen (N2 ) was also detected (for the first time in a comet) in 67P/C-G (from
ROSINA data) with an abundance, relative to CO, of
(5.70±0.66)×10−3 . Assuming that, as in other objects with
a trans-Neptunian origin, N2 is the dominant component of
the nitrogen budget this implies that N2 is significantly depleted (by a factor of ∼ 25×) (Rubin et al. 2015). As N2 and
O2 have similar volatilities, this is also a rather surprising
result.
In this paper, we address several questions: (i) Assuming a primordial origin for the O2 , what does the observed
abundance of O2 tell us about the physical conditions and
dynamical evolution in the molecular cloud out of which the
Solar System formed?, (ii) What additional constraints are
placed by the N2 obervations in Comet 67P/C-G, and (iii)
How can these volatile ices survive the conditions in the
early PSN?
In this study we revisit the possibility that the O2 may
indeed be primordial in nature, and that the O2 :H2 O ratio
is effectively locked into the cometary ice through its delivery by the icy dust grains that agglomerate to form comets.
However, we propose that the O2 is mainly formed in a transient gas-phase chemistry and then stored in the dust ices.
If conditions encourage the build up of ices, then they are
deposited on dust grains in layers. If we make the gross
simplification that no surface or solid-state ice-phase chemistry occurs then the bulk compositions of these ices represents a (time-integrated) ‘fossil’ record of the evolution of
the gas-phase chemistry, moderated by the varying physical
conditions (density, temperature) and freeze-out/desorption
characteristics. This means that the ice compositions are not
just dependent on the instantaneous conditions in the molecular cloud in which they formed, they also depend on the
evolutionary history of the cloud. In particular, the mean
molecular abundances in the bulk of the ices may be very
different to those in the gas-phase, or in the surface layers
of those ices, particularly if the ices are primarily formed
during a period of transient gas-phase enhancement that is
significantly less than the age of the cloud.
The validity of this hypothesis and the sources of uncertainty are discussed in Section 2.3 below. However, it is a
key aim of this paper to investigate what (range of) physical
parameters could yield the observed O2 :H2 O ratio and what
diagnostic power those observations may therefore have concerning the origins of comets.
The nature and possible origins of the O2 excess, together with our hypothesis are discussed in Section 2. Our
physical and chemical models are described in Section 3, and
the results are presented and discussed in Section 4. In Secc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

2.1

POSSIBLE ORIGINS OF THE O2 EXCESS
A primordial origin for the O2

If the assumption is made that the O2 is primordial in nature (i.e. reflecting the abundances in the nascent molecular clouds from which the comets formed) then the high
O2 abundances that are detected in comet 67P/C-G would
seem to be at odds with both observations and (equilibrium) astrochemical models; which predict O2 abundances
of at least an order of magnitude lower in dark clouds than
these values (e.g. Wirström, Charnley, Cordiner & Ceccarelli
2016), although there may be an obvious reason for this - as
discussed above.
In a very detailed dynamical/chemical study, linked to
a specific model of protostellar disk formation and evolution, Taquet et al. (2016) considered three possibilities: (i) a
primordial (dark cloud) origin, (ii) formation during protostellar disk formation, and (iii) production during luminosity
outbursts in the disk. The latter two rely on O2 formation as
a photolytic product of ice desorption, followed by freeze-out
in semi-porous or clathrate ices. The authors favour (i); the
O2 can be produced in primordial dark clouds and survive
until accretion into cometary bodies, although the models
require an exceptionally low H/O ratio (< 0.03), a ‘warm’
temperature of ∼20 K and high densities (> 105 cm−3 ) in the
primordial cloud. Chemically, in these models, the dominant
formation channels for O2 are solid-state reactions occurring
in the surface layers of ices. In the denser regions of clouds,
the dominant pathways for the surface chemistry of O2 and
the formation of hydrogen oxides approximately simplify to:
O + O/OH → O2
O2 + H → HO2
HO2 + H → H2 O2
H2 O2 + H → H2 O + OH
Whilst this last reaction has a significant activation barrier
in the gas-phase, tunnelling in (predominantly water) ices
allows it to proceed rapidly, even at very low temperatures
(∼15K), via surface reactions (Lamberts et al. 2016). Note
that the first of these reactions is in competition with
O + H → OH
preferentially leading to the formation of water, so that the
O:H ratio is critical in defining the O2 formation efficiency.
In this scheme, therefore, the relative timescales for freezeout and free-fall have a major controlling influence. Additionally, the warm temperatures encourage oxygen atom mobility and hence O2 formation, whilst at the same time enhancing the sublimation of atomic hydrogen. The O2 can
be further oxidised to O3 , which itself can then be hydrogenated to OH (e.g. Ioppolo et al. 2008). Thus, the surface
formation of O2 should be accompanied by the presence of
HO2 , H2 O2 and O3 .
Whilst the models do not give an obvious explanation

for the low observed absence of N2 , they suggest that if the
N2 chemistry is somewhat slower than the oxygen chemistry,
then it could freeze out at later times. A similar result could
obtain if N2 is slightly more volatile than CO. Both possibilities would result in a layered ice in which the N2 is not
so closely associated with the water ice and hence is significantly more volatile, perhaps not surviving transport into
the PSN.
The models of Taquet et al. (2016) provide a viable
mechanism that may explain the observed O2 :H2 O ratio as
well as the good correlation between these species, albeit
for somewhat anomalous physical conditions (warmer and
denser than is typical for a dark cloud). This finding is only
robust if the O2 is formed on the primordial dust grains a key result being that these ice compositions can survive
into the forming protosolar nebula. However, the models are
somewhat less successful at explaining the low abundances
of some other species, such as O3 and HO2 . The authors
postulate that this could be explained by the presence of
a barrier (of ∼300K) for the O+O2 and H+O2 reactions,
effectively suppressing much of the O2 surface chemistry.
2.2

Alternative origins for the O2 excess

A number of other theories have been postulated that might
explain the origin of the O2 (and the relative absence of O2 H,
H2 O2 and other species). These are based on the idea that
the O2 may be formed in situ. by a variety of mechanisms,
including radiolysis (by high energy particles), photolysis
(by solar photons), dismutation of H2 O2 , and high energy
ion-surface reactions.
Radiolysis, the chemical consequence of the impact and
penetration of high energy particles into ices can result in
the splitting of H2 O into O2 :
2H2 O + crp → 2H2 + O2 .
The hydrogen atoms and molecules produced in this process would then diffuse out of the ice, so that O2 is not
re-hydrogenated to H2 O. However, the particles in the Solar
wind have limited pentration depths and would only affect
the outermost ice layers of the comet itself. Instead, it has
been shown that the observed O2 abundance in 67P/C-G
can be produced solely via the radiolysis of primordial grains
in the early, dense, PSN - prior to their agglomeration into
the comet (Mousis et al. 2016b). Various dynamical/thermal
scenarios have been considered; trapping of the O2 , or sublimation, followed by re-freezing in ice ‘cages’ or clathrates,
or else as pure ices. There are a number of problems with
this theory: (i) the process is very slow (so the molecular
cloud would have to have been very old), (ii) it requires all
of the energy absorbed by the water ice to be used in this
reaction, with no local heating or ionization, and (iii) radiolysis may produce significant amounts of H2 O2 , HO2 and,
most significantly, O3 .
A possible explanation for the relative absence of
H2 O2 is that the molecule is subject to a redox (dismutation/disproportionation) reaction
2H2 O2 → 2H2 O + O2
during the sublimation of H2 O ice (Dulieu, Minissale &
Bockelée-Morvan 2017). This has the advantage of bypassing the activation barrier problem described above, and

4

J. M. C. Rawlings, T. G. Wilson and D. A. Williams

provides a mechanism whereby O2 can be produced at late
times, when trapped H2 O2 is desorbed. However, the hypothesis requires efficient incorporation of H2 O2 into the ice
and complete conversion to O2 to explain both the observed
O2 abundance and the low relative abundance of H2 O2 .
A very different suggestion (Yao & Giapis 2017) is that
the O2 does not originate in the cometary ices at all but,
instead, is formed following the prompt (Eley-Rideal) reaction of energetic H2 O+ ions with surface oxides (in silicates
etc.). This results in the production of excited ‘oxy-water’
(H2 O-O? ) isomeric to, but the not the same as, hydrogen
peroxide. This dissociates to H+ and the excited state HO−
2
cation, which in turn dissociates to O−
2 . This ion is subject
to photodetachment, yielding O2 . Such a mechanism naturally explains the absence of O3 and the presence of HO2
whose abundance, although low, is still some three times
larger than what is inferred for interstellar clouds. However,
the model has yet to be analysed carefully in the context
of the temporal correlations of the various molecular species
detected by ROSINA (Hässig et al. 2015).

2.3

A gas-phase primordial origin of O2

Starting from OH - either produced in gas-phase ion-neutral
reactions, or via surface chemistry - the gas-phase chemistry
of O2 in dark cloud conditions is relatively simple, the formation being dominated by

Charnley, Cordiner & Ceccarelli (2016) argue that, in dense
cores where (a) CO conversion is complete and (b) the effective rate for O-atom freeze-out may be reduced if the chemical conversion of O to OH and H2 O is inhibited due to the
low abundance of atomic hydrogen; the O2 abundance might
be significantly enhanced in transient peaks; the competing
timescales resulting in significant chemical non-linearities.
There is some evidence to suggest that large O/CO ratios
may exist in dense, dark clouds (e.g. Vastel et al. 2000).
The possible existence of this transient phenomenon
raises the possibility that O2 abundances in the PSN may be
significantly different to those predicted in models of quasistatic molecular clouds. These differences could arise from
non-linearities in the time-dependencies - perhaps enhanced
by the dynamical history of collapsing clouds, coupled with
the fact that the dust ice mantles have the ability to preserve a ‘fossil record’ of gas-phase chemical evolution. The
magnitude of these deviations from equilibrium will therefore depend on a number of factors, including the dynamics
of the flow, the freeze-out and desorption characteristics of
O, O2 and other species, and the physical conditions within
the gas (the temperature, density, and cosmic ray ionization
rate etc.).
An additional benefit of this hypothesis is that it would
help to explain the relatively low abundances of HO2 , H2 O2
and O3 which are part of the same surface-chemistry network that produces O2 .

O + OH → O2 + H.
This reaction is in competition with the freeze-out and hydrogenation of atomic oxygen:
O + grain → ......H2 O(s.)
The main destruction channel of O2 is
O2 + C → CO + O
whilst O2 is also lost from the gas-phase by freeze-out into
grain ice mantles:
O2 → O2 (s.)
There are several competing reactions here and modern
studies of the O2 -chemistry in interstellar cloud conditions
(e.g. Yildiz et al. 2013) have found that the depletion of
O-atoms by freeze-out and conversion to H2 O and/or the
destruction of O2 by C-atoms (before CO formation is complete) yields low values of the O2 abundance - typically an
order of magnitude or more smaller than what is found in
comet 67P/C-G. However, these models also show that the
O2 abundance rises significantly after the efficient conversion of C to CO has occurred (Wirström, Charnley, Cordiner
& Ceccarelli 2016). Moreover, the models also assume that
the freeze-out of O-atoms and conversion to H2 O, which is
fully retained in the ices is efficient. The gas-phase reactions
are relatively fast at interstellar cloud temperatures, so that
the abundance of O2 is essentially determined by the abundances of free oxygen atoms (formation) and carbon atoms
(destruction). These, in turn, are controlled by the efficiency
of CO formation, and also the freeze-out of the residual oxygen atoms (assuming that O>C).
There are thus three competing timescales: O to O2
conversion, CO formation and O-atom freeze-out. Wirström,

THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL MODEL

We have constructed a model that adopts these ideas to
study how the dust ice-mantle composition depends on the
physical and chemical evolution of the material from which
comets form. Recognising that protoplanetary and protosolar disk physical/chemical models are not at a sufficient
maturity to identify a ‘standard’ model of the origin and
evolution of cometary bodies, we do not elaborate on the
poorly-constrained details of this evolution, but instead opt
to implement a simple physical representation of the physical evolution, coupled with a more complex chemical model.
This model tests the sensitivity of the chemical evolution
to the dynamical evolution of the gas, and identifies how
the abundances depends on key physical parameters, rather
than resulting from artefacts of a detailed, specific model.
To represent the collapse and evolution of the protosolar nebula into the protosolar disk we therefore implement
a simple model, specifically created for this study, that follows the chemical and physical evolution of the gas in three
phases:
I.) A static, diffuse or dark cloud phase, of duration ∼
107 years, to simulate the chemical conditions in the interstellar cloud from which the Solar System formed.
II.) A collapse phase - which we model as a free-fall collapse with a simple infall velocity retardation scaling factor
(B, which simulates the effects of quasi-static contraction,
magnetic braking, non-spherical effects, disk vorticity etc.).
The formulation for the free-fall contraction is as given in
Rawlings et al. (1992). This leads to
III.) A final, static, high density, phase which represents the
conditions in the early Kuiper Belt/Oort Cloud.
c 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

O2 in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
The model follows the time-dependence of the chemistry
of a single (representative) point as the physical conditions
(density, gas and dust temperatures, extinction etc.) evolve
through these three phases. The differential equations describing the chemistry and dynamics are co-integrated with
the DLSODE package (Hindmarsh 1983).
We again emphasise that the physical properties of all
three phases are very poorly constrained. Our approach is
somewhat different to the physical models adopted by other
studies such as that of Taquet et al. (2016). Although those
models include considerable physical complexity, the initial conditions (prior to dynamical collapse and disk evolution) are modelled by steady-state evolution of a cloud for
a time equivalent to the free-fall timescale. This will have
considerable bearing on the assumed composition of the ices
and, unsurprisingly, that approach yields very low (quasiequilibrium) values for the O2 abundances in both the gasphase and in the ices.
However, as explained above, the ices effectively contain a fossil record of the dynamical and chemical evolution
and the relative contributions of the chemistry in each of the
three dynamical phases will depend on the competitions between relevant timescales, such as those for gas-phase chemistry, freeze-out/desorption and dynamical evolution.
In those situations where the conditions in Phase I are
equivalent to those of a diffuse cloud, freeze-out of icy mantles will not occur until that time in Phase II when the density has risen (and the dust temperature fallen) such that
thermal desorption is quenched. In Phase II we simply assume homologous collapse, in which case the extinction (Av )
scales as n2/3 , yielding very large extinctions by the beginning of phase III. The dependency of Tgas and Tdust on Av
is taken from semi-empirical modelling studies (e.g. Keto &
Caselli 2010), constrained by the boundary conditions imposed by the specified temperatures in Phases I and III. The
mean dust grain radius and surface area per hydrogen nucleon (given in Table 1) imply a normal interstellar dust to
gas ratio.
In Figure 1 we show the evolution of the density, extinction and the temperatures of the gas and dust components
in the collapse phase (Phase II).
It seems likely that the cosmic ray flux will be modulated (reduced) due to exclusion by young stellar winds
(Cleeves, Bergin & Adams 2014) and/or magnetic field channelling (Fatuzzo & Adams 2014) in the early PSN, and the
assumption that typical (interstellar) cosmic ray ionization
fluxes apply throughout the protostellar/protoplanetary
evolution is almost certainly inaccurate. We have therefore
considered a range of cosmic ray ionization rates in our models. However, we found that the results are insensitive to the
time-dependence of the cosmic ray ionization rate during the
collapse pahse so, for the sake of simplicity and lacking any
empirical constraints, we make the simpliying assumption
that it is constant throughout all three phases.
Our chemistry includes a comprehensive network of
1296 neutral-neutral and ion-neutral gas-phase reactions
and 134 gas-grain (freeze-out and desorption) and surface reactions, between 96 gas-phase chemical species and 22 solidstate species. This gives good coverage of the formation and
destruction channels for O2 . The relevant oxygen-bearing
species in the solid state include: O, O2 , OH, H2 O, CO, and
CO2 .

We use a highly simplified representation of the surface
chemistry, so that we can differentiate between the gas-phase
processes that we are studying, and the surface reactions
leading to O2 formation and destruction, that have been
reported elsewhere.
Thus, whilst we include the surface oxidations and hydrogenation of O, O+ , OH, OH+ , O2 to oxygen hydrides,
O3 , and (in reactions with CO) to CO2 , the rate coefficients
are set to zero for many of these reactions in our standard
model. We do, however, assume efficient hydrogenation of O
and OH, so that all O and OH species that impact and stick
to grains are fully hydrogenated to H2 O ice. We further assume that all H2 O so-formed remains in the ice. We do not
allow for any conversion of surface O or OH to O2 (possibly underestimating the O2 :H2 O ratio), but nor do we allow
for the hydrogenation or oxidation of surface O2 to products such as O3 , and leading to H2 O formation. Obviously,
these processes would lead to lower O2 :H2 O ratios. However, we also note that there is a notable deficiency of H2 O2
in the coma of comet 67P/C-G so that it would seem that
the sublimation conversion of O2 to H2 O via H2 O2 (Dulieu,
Minissale & Bockelée-Morvan 2017) may not be efficient in
these conditions. We have therefore chosen not to include
this channel - but recognise that its omission may result in
our overestimating the O2 :H2 O ratio.
We also allow for surface reactions of CO with O and
OH to form CO2 with 10% efficiency, yielding the empirical
CO:CO2 ratio of ∼ 1 (e.g. Chiar et al. 2011). As dictated
by laboratory experiments and the observed abundances of
complex organic molecules in astrophysical sources, surface
CO is assumed to convert to CH3 OH and H2 CO with an
efficiency of ∼ 10% (Watanabe & Kouchi 2002).
We have included a full range of thermal and nonthermal desorption mechanisms, including; photodesorption, cosmic-ray induced photodesorption, cosmic ray heating (hot-spot and whole grain) and formation-enthalpy
driven desorption. The desorption that is induced by cosmic
ray heating results from the bulk heating of the ice mantles,
or even the whole grains. However, photodesorption (due
to to both the primary interstellar radiation field and that
induced by cosmic rays) only affects the surface layers of
the ices. To ensure that these processes are correctly modelled, we determine the chemical composition of the ices on a
layer-by-layer basis, and consider the desorption efficiencies
for each layer. We adopt commonly used values for the the
yields for the various desorption processes (e.g. Hollenbach
et al. 2009) although, in our standard model, we assume
that the yield for H2 -formation-induced desorption is zero,
in line with results from models of starless cores (Rawlings,
Keto & Caselli 2019).
As the nature of the cometary ices is not necessarily
similar to that which exists in interstellar dark clouds and
the roles of photolysis/radiolysis are not clear we consider
that the inclusion of more elaborate surface chemistries (e.g.
to form complex organic molecules) is not justified in this
study.
The standard physical parameters, together with key
chemical parameters (abundances and binding energies) that
we use in this model are summarised in Table 1. The chemical initial conditions in the diffuse gas (Phase I) are taken
to be atomic + H2 . The model results are not sensitive to
variations in this assumption.

Observational constraints

The rather simplistic assumption that measurements made
with ROSINA, and other instruments on the Rosetta mission, represent the mean abundance ratios throughout the
coma has subsequently given way to the realisation that
there are significant diurnal variations (due to the rotation
of the comet) - essentially deriving from variations in illumination conditions (e.g. Raponi et al. 2017), seasonal variations (i.e. resulting from the tilt in the comet’s spin axis),
and variations due to morphological and compositional variations over the comet’s surface (e.g. differences exist between
the composition and outflow properties of the gas outgassing
from the neck and the poles of the two lobes; Fougere et
al. 2016). Morever, there are probably significant variations
in the ice compositions as a function of depth (Brugger et
al. 2016). However, interestingly, observations with VIRTIS
show that the refractory compositions of both lobes are similar, suggesting that the cometesimals formed in the same
region (Capaccioni et al. 2015).
In this section we briefly summarise the observational

data for comet 67P/C-G and identify the constraints that
we use to test the success of our model:
The O2 :H2 O ratio was measured by ROSINA to
be 3.80±0.85% (and a similar value was obtained for
comet 1P/Halley: O2 /H2 O=3.7±1.7%, Rubin, Altwegg, van
Dishoeck & Schwehm 2015). The variations in the O2 and
H2 O are fairly well-correlated and, in addition, the O2 distribution is approximately isotropic and does not vary significantly with time or with heliocentric distance (Bieler et al.
2015). The same study also found low values for the abundances of other oxygen hydrides; HO2 :O2 = 0.19%, H2 O2 :O2
= 0.06%, and also O3 :O2 <0.0025%.
ROSINA observations yielded an N2 :CO ratio of ∼0.171.6%, with a mean of 0.57%. The two species, of similar
volatility, were found to be only moderately correlated, and
vary with position above the surface of the comet. The N2
and CO are poorly correlated with H2 O (Bieler et al. 2015).
Because of this, and the fact that the H2 O production rate
may change with heliocentric distance, Rubin et al. (2015)
consider the N2 :CO ratio to be a better metric of the N2
abundance than the N2 :H2 O ratio. Making the reasonable
assumption that N2 and CO are the dominant reservoirs of
nitrogen and carbon in the PSN and that the conversion of N
to N2 is essentially complete (Rubin et al. 2015), the N2 :CO
ratio should reflect the elemental abundances of N and C in

The observed value therefore suggests that N2 is depleted by
a factor of ∼ 25× (Rubin et al. 2015). In addition Balsiger
et al. (2015) found that 36 Ar is well-correlated to N2 (which
has a similar volatility) so that 36 Ar:N2 = 0.9±0.03%. The
poor correlation of both species with H2 O means that the
inferred N2 :H2 O ratio is somewhat less well-constrained at
0.011-0.26%.
The relationship between CO/CO2 and H2 O is very
much more complex and ill-defined. Whilst CO:H2 O = 1030% over the sunlit hemisphere (Rubin et al. 2015), the
CO:H2 O and CO2 :H2 O ratios are highly variable; qualitatively they are reasonably well-correlated, but there are huge
variations in the abundance ratios, both diurnal and seasonal/morphological, so that the ratios can exceed unity.
Thus CO/H2 O ranges from 0.13(±0.07) to 4(±1), and
CO2 /H2 O ranges from 0.08(±0.05) to 8(±2). There is less
variation in the CO and CO2 abundances than in that of
H2 O, and the H2 O peaks when oberving the neck, whilst
the CO2 peaks when observing the underside of the body
of the larger of the two lobes (Hässig et al. 2015). The surface CO:CO2 ratio was also measured to be ∼ 0.07 with
Ptolemy (the mass spectrometer aboard the Philae lander),
significantly smaller than the values inferred in the coma
from ROSINA measurements (∼ 0.50-1.62) (Brugger et al.
2016). Taken together, these facts may indicate that there
are possible compositional inhomogeneities and that the CO
and CO2 sublimate from greater depths in the ice than the
H2 O, although the possibility remains that these could simply be the result of variations in illumination. In their anaylsis, Brugger et al. (2016) found that there was no clear distinction as to whether the H2 O ice is primarily crystalline,
amorphous, or composed of clathrates; to which we return
in section 5 below.

Finally, we note that other more complex organic
molecules (some of which are nitrogen-bearing) have also
been detected. Many sulfur-bearing molecules were also detected by ROSINA (Calmonte et al. 2016), although they
are notably absent in COSAC measurements (Goesmann et
al. 2015). As our understanding of sulfur chemistry (and
particularly surface reactions) is very poor, we have not attempted to model the sulfur chemistry. To summarize the
data that are relevant to this study, in Table 2 we specify
the observational constraints that we use to test our model.
Note that we do not include an accurate representation of
the surface chemistry of HO2 , H2 O2 and O3 and so the observed abundances of these species are not used to constrain
our model.

RESULTS

We initially applied a simple (static) model to perform an
analysis that allowed us to determine which physical parameters are the most significant in determining the O2 :H2 O
ratio. We found that enhanced O2 :H2 O ratios (of the order
of 1%) are obtained if the number density lies in the range
104 − 105 cm−3 . The abundance of O2 is also enhanced if
we make the assumption that a fraction (∼10%) of the H2 O
that is formed by surface reactions on dust grains is desorbed
via the enthalpy of formation of the molecule.
In the density range; n ∼ 104 − 105 cm−3 , the O2 :H2 O
ratio is found to be particularly sensitive to the cosmic ray
ionization rate, primarily due to the relatively high efficiency
of O2 desorption by cosmic-ray heating of grain mantles. If
ζ is as low as 10−18 s−1 , then O2 :H2 O may be as high as
∼ 10% in equilibrium.
From this initial analysis, we deduced that the key free
parameters are; the density and temperature in phase III,
the free-fall collapse retardation factor (B) and the cosmicray ionization rate (ζ). The range of parameters that we
have investigated in the full model are: B = 0.1−1, nIII =107 1011 cm−3 , TIII =10-20 K, ζ/ζ0 =0.1-10.0 (ζ0 = 1.3×1017 s−1 ),
and G/G0 = 0.5-10.0 (where G0 is the standard interstellar
radiation field).
We have considered all possible parameter combinations

8

and present a selection of representative results in Figure 2
and Table 3.
In Figure 2 we show the time-evolution of the abundances of relevant gas-phase and ice-phase species in the
collapse phase (Phase II) and the final, steady state phase
(Phase III). The figure shows many of the key features
of the chemical behaviours. Thus, there is a clearly visible threshold density for the onset of ice formation, above
which the extinction is sufficiently high and the dust temperature drops sufficiently low that the rates for accretion
exceed those for desorption. The effects of the non-linearities
in the chemistry are also visible in the transient behaviours
of species such as O2 and N2 ; the abundances of which show
strong peaks in the collapse phase, but then decline at later
times. It is worth noting (see section 6 below) that there is
very little qualitative difference between the evolution of the
O2 and N2 abundances. It is also evident that the non-linear
behaviour is limited to the collapse phase (Phase II); there is
very little chemical evolution in the PSN phase (Phase III),
where the main chemical processes are surface reactions (e.g.
the gradual conversion of CO to CO2 ) and a slow response
to the changing balance between the freeze-out and desorption processes. Comparing the evolution of the abundances
in Figure 2 to the dynamical evolution in Figure 1 it can be
seen how the period of O2 enhancement is relatively short
(< 0.5Myr) compared to the dynamical age of the cloud
but, crucially, occurs at the time of bulk ice mantle accretion. The ices therefore contain abundances of O2 that are
significantly larger than stochastically observed gas-phase
abundances in dark clouds.
The essential numerical output from the model consists
of the abundance ratios of key species at snapshots in time.
In Table 3 we give the values of the (solid state) abundance
ratios of O2 :H2 O, N2 :H2 O, N2 :CO, and CO:H2 O (a) at the
end of the collapse phase (Phase II), and (b) after 100 Myrs
evolution in the final, dense phase (Phase III). From this
table we can see some of the sensitivities of these ratios to
the various free parameters but, overall, we can see that the
modelled abundance ratios are fairly close to the observationally inferred values in most cases and are quite robust
to variations in the values of the free parameters. Specifically, the O2 :H2 O, N2 :H2 O, N2 :CO and CO:H2 O ratios typically lie in the ranges of 1-3.7%, 5-13%, 5-17%, and 100142% respectively. In a few cases (e.g. for nIII =107 cm−3 or
ζ/ζ0 = 10) there is a strong late-time evolution of the N2 :CO
and CO:H2 O ratios, which is primarily driven by long-term
desorption effects.
The important quantitative results that we have obtained from the three-phase model are:
• A good fit to the O2 :H2 O ratio (2-5%) is obtained whenever B = 0.1 and ζ/ζ0 < 10, regardless of the values of nIII
and TIII . A lower, but reasonable ratio ∼ 1-2% is obtained
for B = 1.0.
• The modelled N2 :CO abundance ratio is closest to the
observed values (0.17-1.6%) when the collapse is slow (B =
0.1). Values of 1.5-2% can be obtained in somewhat extreme
conditions (nIII = 107 cm−3 , ζ/ζ0 = 10 and Tg,III = 20K)
but these also result in low O2 :H2 O ratios of ∼ 0.1 − 0.2%.
At higher densities (nIII > 108 cm−3 ) and when ζ/ζ0 = 0.1
and Tg,III = 10K, slightly larger values (∼ 2.7 − 3.1%) are
obtained but these models also yield O2 :H2 O ∼ 3.1 − 3.3%.

In general, the ratio is found to be very sensitive to the
cosmic ray ionization rate, so that for ζ/ζ0 = 10, desorption
leads to CO-poor ices and very large values result.
• N2 :H2 O ratios of ∼4-15% are produced in most of the
models, considerably larger than the observed values. A
good fit can be obtained for low values of nIII , coupled with
high values of ζ; especially at late times - but these largely
result from the effect of efficient desorption, which also leads
to very low O2 abundances. However, an O2 :H2 O ratio of
∼1% can be obtained if G/G0 =1 and B=1.0.
• The modelled CO:H2 O abundance ratio is typically
very large (of order unity) which is compatible with observations. Values of ∼10-40% (as measured for the sunlit
hemisphere) can be reproduced for low values of nIII (107 108 cm−3 ), and ζ/ζ0 = 1. This ratio is also very sensitive to
ζ/ζ0 , being strongly suppressed for high cosmic ray ionization rates.
Taken together, the best fits for the O2 :H2 O and N2 :CO
ratios are obtained for B = 0.1, ζ/ζ0 = 0.1, TIII =10K and
any value of nIII . For these parameters CO/H2 O∼1.
We therefore find that, for a reasonably large volume
of the parameter space that we have investigated, we can
obtain a good match to the observed values of the O2 :H2 O
ratio and a resonable match to the observed N2 :CO ratio.
A good match to the N2 :H2 O ratio can only be obtained
with a more contrived parameter combination, and most of
our models yield CO:H2 O abundance ratios of order unity,
comparable to the obserationally inferred values.

THE SURVIVAL OF O2 IN THE PSN

Having determined that O2 can be formed in the gas-phase
and retained in ice mantles, we now address the issue of
whether or not this can be incorporated, without substantial modification due to thermal processing, into the young
PSN. There is some debate as to the efficiency of the delivery
of primordial volatiles from molecular clouds into the protosolar nebula, although models show that the abundance
of H2 O and the HDO:H2 O abundance ratio are preserved,
indicating that interstellar water ice is efficiently delivered
to protoplanetary disks (Furuya et al. 2017).
To answer this question we need to know both how
volatile species are trapped in the more abundant water ices
and how they respond to thermal processing. The phases
and morphology of water ice are extremely complex but, for
the purpose of our discussion, we can identify three ways in
which (mixed-in) volatiles can be retained in water ices: (i)
in crystalline water ice, which can only include very small
fractions of volatiles, such as O2 , (ii) in amorphous water ice,
which can hold signficant amounts of volatiles, but which is
very susceptible to thermal processing, and (iii) in closed
cages of water molecules, or ‘clathrates’.
Previous studies of the chemistry of (primordial)
cometary ices have tended to ignore the processing of the
pre-cometary material by the Sun’s protostellar precursor,
whose luminosity at the top of the Hayashi track was very
much greater than that of the present-day Sun.
In this context, Mousis et al. (2016a) identify two possible reservoirs for ices and trapped O2 : (i) in the 5-30au
range; where interstellar ices have been sublimated and refrozen (as the PSN cooled) into crystalline and clathrate

ices, and (ii) in the outer regions (>30au); in which interstellar ices are pristine, amorphous and semi-porous. Unfortunately the boundary between the two is poorly determined
so that there is some ambiguity as to which source dominates in Jupiter-family comets, such as 67P/C-G, which
originated in the trans-Neptunian Kuiper belt. Mousis et al.
(2016a) favour (i) as the best way of explaining the N2 and
Ar abundances in 67P/C-G; with clathrate formation on
grains at ∼44-50K in the cooling PSN; the comet forming
from the agglomeration of these grains, with any untrapped
volatiles frozen out as pure crystalline ices.
The efficiency with which volatile species, such as O2 ,
can be retained in ices and their susceptibility to desorption
is thus obviously more than a simple dependence on the
binding energies. In general, it depends very strongly on the
c 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

degree of mixing with the water ice and the solid-state phase
of the ice itself as indicated above. Experimentally, studies
have shown that, as icy grains are gradually heated, species
such as O2 and N2 can desorb in four distinct bands; (i) from
the (multi-layered) pure species (at T ∼ 20 − 30K), (ii) from
a monolayer on the water ice (at T ∼ 40 − 50K), (iii) resulting from the amorphous to crystalline phase transition in
the water ice, that releases volatiles trapped in closed pore
clathrates and is exothermic (at T ∼ 140K), and (iv) codesorption of the the remaining, trapped, volatiles with the
sublimation of the water ice itself (at T ∼ 160K) (Collings
et al. 2004; Viti et al. 2004). This desorption band structure
is a consequence of a rather simplified unmixed/‘onion-skin’
representation of the layering of the ices with the amorphous
water ice being ‘doped’ by thermal diffusion from surround-

ing apolar ice layers. Such a stratified structure is probably
not representative of cometary ice grains, and also does not
consider the possibility of volatile species formation as a result of internal solid-state reactions. In these discussions we
must also be very careful to remember that the comet is
best represented as an aggregate of icy grains and not to
conceptualize it as a ‘giant grain’ with distinct ice layers.
However, the key findings of these desorption experiments have been confirmed by more recent studies (e.g.
Collings et al. 2015). Specifically; (i) O2 and N2 have very
similar desorption characteristics and will compete for available binding sites in the ice, and (ii) water ice has the ability
to both trap the volatile species in closed-pore clathrates
(formed in the phase change from a more porous amorphous state, that occurs at T ∼ 30 − 88K) and semi-porous
ice, and this hugely modifies the binding property of the
volatiles themselves. It is therefore evident that the desorption properties are critically dependent on the way in which
the volatiles are deposited and mixed with the water ice. For
co-deposited ices, only the crystallisation and co-desorption
bands are relevant, with the crystallisation desorption accounting for up to 67% of the total volatile desorption. If
the bulk ice is formed from the accumulation of very small
interstellar grains, then it may well have a porous structure,
so that most of the O2 could be trapped in clathrates, to be
released in the amorphous to crystalline phase change.
This phase change is very rapid at high temperatures
(> 130K), but even at temperatures as low as 90K, the transition only takes ∼103 years, with T 680K for long-term stability. Such conditions are unlikely in the early PSN. As well
as stellar radiation, the phase change can also be effected
by micrometeoritic impact heating and internal radiogenic
heating etc. Here it is worth noting that studies have shown
that both crystalline and amorphous water ice are present
in trans-Neptunian objects (Terai et al. 2016).

Indeed, it has been speculated that exothermic transition of amorphous to crystalline ice may be a significant
energy source that drives outgassing from comet 67P/C-G

N2 IN COMET 67P/C-G

The apparent absence of N2 in 67P/C-G is puzzling, and is
not well-reproduced by our models. N2 has similar desorption characteristics to CO; the desorption energies of both
species are highly dependent on the degree of interaction
with water ice, but - irrespective of environment - the ratio
of the desorption energies for N2 and CO is ∼0.9, implying
that the desorption temperatures are within a few Kelvin of
each other (Fayolle et al. 2016).
As with the chemistry of O2 , N2 formation competes
with the hydrogenation of nitrogen to NH3 - both in the
gas-phase and on the surface of grains. The chemistry of N2
is somewhat different and less well understood than that of
O2 . In our models we find that, typically, the N2 :NH3 ratios
are of order unity, although there are significant margins of
error in these values.
Another possibility is that the strong dependence of the
binding energy on the presence of water implies that the
desorption properties of N2 and CO would be very different
if, for example, the N2 predominantly resides in a less waterrich environment than the CO; in which case the N2 would
effectively be much more volatile. However, our modelling
shows little evidence for significant differences in the timedependencies of the chemistry of O2 and N2 which would be
necessary to explain this layering.
Alternatively, laboratory experiments show that N2
may be inefficiently trapped in water ices as compared to
CO, to a degree that could explain the observed N2 /CO
ratio. Thus Rubin et al. (2015) speculate that N2 is ineffic 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

O2 in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
ciently trapped above ∼24K, and it may also be inefficiently
trapped in clathrates.
However, the observed strong correlation between Argon and N2 is consistent with both species being included
in ices at very low temperatures (Balsiger et al. 2015). A
possibility is that the N2 could have been trapped more efficiently at lower temperatures (∼ 20K) but then subject to
efficient thermal sublimation in the high luminosity protostellar phase.
Other mechanisms that may result in suppressed N2
abundances include radiogenic heating due to the decay of
Aluminium and Iron isotopes, which could result in the desorption of volatiles, such as N2 , Ar and CO, during the accretion phase. Indeed, the available energy may be sufficient to
result in the conversion of simple nitrogen-bearing species,
such as N2 , HCN, and NH3 , into complex organics and possibly even amino acids (Mousis et al. 2017).
Finally, we should note that the nitrogen budget in the
early PSN may not be simple: there are strong variations
of the 14 N/15 N isotopic ratio throughout the Solar System,
which is indicative of the presence of more than one reservoir
of volatile nitrogen (Hily-Blant et al. 2017). It is in fact
possible that the N2 /CO ratio observed in 67P/C-G is not at
all typical. Measurements for other comets indicate a range
of 1-6%, whilst recent observations of Comet C/2016 R2
(which has a long period of ∼20,550 years, originated in
the Oort Cloud, has a semi-major axis of ∼1,500 AU and
a perihelion distance of 2.6 AU) imply values of N2 :CO >
6%. The absence of any detection of NH2 suggests that N2
is the dominant reservoir for the nitrogen content of the ice
(Cochran & McKay 2018; Opitom et al. 2019). It is also
worth noting that major trans-Neptunian objects (such as
Triton or Pluto) are very N2 -rich.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Bearing in mind that there are several hypotheses that have
been postulated to explain the high O2 abundance in the
coma of Comet 67P/C-G it is apparent that, despite the
claims often made in the literature, the gas-grain chemistries
of even simple molecules such as O2 and H2 O are still highly
uncertain and subject to debate.
The most successful previous studies have explained the
relatively low abundance of O2 in interstellar clouds as resulting from long static evolution, leading to the freeze-out of
oxygen atoms and molecules and conversion to H2 O in normal circumstances (Yildiz et al. 2013). The relatively high
abundance of O2 in comet 67P/C-G is then explained by
conditions that yield an exceptionally low H:O ratio in the
ices, resulting in the partial inhibition of the conversion of
O and O2 to H2 O (Taquet et al. 2016).
Instead, we propose that sufficient O2 may be produced
by gas-phase reactions, and in a way that is robust to variations in certain free parameters and hence circumvents the
necessity for these rather stringent physical conditions. In
this scenario, the observed ‘O2 excess’ derives from a ‘fossil
record’, retained in the stratified ices, of the chemical and
dynamical evolution of the molecular cloud from which the
protosolar nebula formed. Using a representative model of
the time-dependent collapse of a primordial cloud into the
pre-Solar nebula, coupled to a gas-phase and gas-grain chemc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

istry we find that a gas-phase primordial origin of cometary
O2 is both very viable and is fairly robust to the physical
parameters (such as temperature and density).
Our key findings for Comet 67P/C-G are:
• As a result of the non-linearities due to the competing
timescales for gas-phase chemistry, freeze-out and collapse,
significant O2 can be produced in transient peaks in the
collapse phase.
• The O2 is trapped in stratified ice mantles that retain
a temporal record of the chemical evolution during the dynamical evolution of the cloud.
• The outer ice-layers are O2 -poor, so that the low gasphase and solid-state abundances that are inferred for molecular clouds are not incompatible with the existence of a significant reservoir of hidden O2 .
• Our results are robust to the choice of values for free
parameters, but show sensitivity to the assumed cosmic ray
ionization rate and the rate of collapse. The most favourable
conditions for the formation of O2 (and other species) at values that match observations are when the cosmic ionization
rate is 0.1× the interstellar value (i.e. ζ ∼ 10−18 s−1 ) and
the collapse rate is ten times slower than free-fall.
• Other abundance ratios, such as N2 :CO and CO:H2 O
are also reasonably consistent with observations.
• The gas-phase origin provides a natural explanation for
the relatively low observed abundances of HO2 , H2 O2 and
O3 .
• Unless quite specific conditions prevail, the model significantly overproduces the N2 :H2 O ratio.
• Several mechanisms have also been proposed in which
the O2 is created subsequent to sublimation from the
cometary ice in the gas-phase coma chemistry. Whilst these
have some drawbacks they cannot be excluded as possible
sources of the O2 excess.
• Finally, it is quite possible that the chemical composition of the coma of Comet 67P/C-G is anomalous and may
not be representative of Jupiter-family comets.
On the assumptions that the O2 abundances that are
determined from the ROSINA data are representative of the
composition of the cometary ice and are primordial in nature, then the results that we have obtained suggest that
the observed enhancement of O2 mainly originates from the
phase in which the primordial cloud is collapsing to form
the proto-solar nebula and is is not strongly sensitive to the
physical conditions in that epoch.
The relationship between the abundances in primordial
molecular clouds and the pre-solar nebula is complex and
not well-defined, as the abundance ratios will inevitably be
modified by thermal processing in the early stages of the evolution of the Solar System. Therefore, our results are somewhat compromised by the fact that pristine amorphous ices
will almost certainly not survive intact into the protosolar
nebula. Instead there will be a degree of thermal processing;
heating, annealing and possibly re-freezing which will result
in ices of varying compositions. Thus, O2 can be included,
or trapped, in amorphous ices or clathrates - the latter being
the more resilient to thermal processing. It seems like that
some degree of sublimation, followed by re-freezing (possibly
into clathrates) will occur but, in any case, the abundances
of O2 that we obtain must be regarded as upper limits for
what will be retained in the ices in the proto-Solar nebula.

This obviously leads to significant ambiguity in the determintion of the origin of the O2 in Comet 67P/C-G.
The low observed abundance of N2 relative to O2 is
surprising and is not predicted by the primordial ice origin
models. As there are no significant differences in the timedependencies of the O2 and the N2 chemistries, and both
species have very similar binding energies in the various ice
phases, it is unlikely that this is an affect of compositional
stratification in the ices. The fact that N2 has been detected
at significant levels in other comets suggests that the most
likely cause is related to the specific thermal processing history of Comet 67P/C-G.
