Models in which dark matter consists entirely of primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses around
1017 g are currently unconstrained. However, if PBHs are a component of the Galactic dark matter
density, they will inject a large flux of energetic particles into the Galaxy as they radiate. Positrons
produced by these black holes will subsequently propagate throughout the Galaxy and annihilate,
contributing to the Galactic 511 keV line. Using measurements of this line by SPI/INTEGRAL as
a constraint on PBH positron injection, we place new limits on PBH abundance in the mass range
1016 − 1017 g, ruling out models in which these PBHs constitute the entirety of dark matter.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Dark matter (DM) is one of the largest outstanding
mysteries of modern physics. A large variety of models
relying on new degrees of freedom have been proposed
to explain this additional matter content, with masses
ranging all the way down to 10−22 eV [1]. On the high
mass end, an explanation that has experienced a resurgence in recent years is that dark matter is composed of
primordial black holes (PBHs) that formed as a result of
perturbations in the early universe. (See Ref. [2] for a
recent review of these models and bounds.)
There are a plethora of proposed production mechanisms for PBHs [3–17], but regardless of how the PBHs
are produced, any extant PBHs will be producing radiation by means of Hawking evaporation today [18]. The
energy spectrum of this radiation is thermal and peaks
near the temperature of the black hole, given by
TBH =

8πGM

511 keV excess could not be produced by PBHs, while in
Ref. [22], the authors find that a log-normal distribution
of masses with mean of roughly 6 × 1016 g might yield
both the correct 511 keV excess and correct DM abundance. None of the existing literature contains a complete
analysis of the constraints on PBH abundance and mass
distribution one can infer purely from the measured value
of the 511 keV line. In this Letter, we fully determine
the precise bounds associated with positron injection by
PBHs.
The main existing bounds in this mass range come
from observations of both extragalactic [24] and Galactic
gamma rays [25], as well as recent bounds using measurements of high-energy positrons by the Voyager-1 satellite [26]. We demonstrate that positron injection allows
us to extend the limits on the fraction of DM that PBHs
can comprise by roughly an order of magnitude for PBHs
of mass 1016 to 1017 g, an otherwise unbounded region
of parameter space [27].

with M the black hole mass. In this paper, we focus
mainly on black holes with masses near 1016 g, which
corresponds to a temperature of ∼ 1 MeV. At these temperatures, the PBHs are sufficiently hot so as to be producing positrons at a large rate.
A prominent effect of PBH DM in this mass range is
therefore the injection of large quantities of positrons into
the Galaxy. These positrons will eventually annihilate,
producing a spectrum of gamma rays peaked at 511 keV.
However, measurements of the 511 keV line by the INTEGRAL satellite [19] place a strong limit on the rate
at which positrons can be annihilating anywhere in the
Galaxy. This in turn constrains the fraction of DM that
can be composed of PBHs in this mass range (by the
same argument as was used to constrain dark photons in
Ref. [20]).
It should be noted that the contribution of PBHs to
the 511 keV line has already been discussed in the literature [21–23], though mainly only in reference to attempting to explain an excess in the 511 keV line measured in
the Galactic center. In Ref. [21], the authors focus exclusively on a scale-invariant distribution and argue that the

POSITRON PROPAGATION IN THE
GALAXY

In this section, we present existing results on positron
propagation in the Galaxy and set an upper bound
on positron injection energy such that PBH-produced
positrons do not escape the Galaxy.
For the PBHs considered in this paper, the production
rate of radiation is too low to form an e+ e− plasma [28],
so radiated positrons will escape the immediate vicinity
of the black hole and begin to propagate through the interstellar medium (ISM). Positrons propagating through
the Galaxy have a long lifetime in the ISM (105 to 106
years) [29], during which they diffuse along magnetic field
lines and lose energy mainly through Coulomb interactions. Ultimately, after slowing down, they annihilate
and can contribute to the 511 keV Galactic flux via either direct annihilation with an electron or the formation
of parapositronium [30].
Though much work has been put into modeling
positron propagation in the ISM (see, e.g., Refs. [30–32]),
it is a notoriously difficult problem. The distance that

2
a positron propagates depends heavily on the ionization
fraction, temperature, and density of the region through
which it is passing, as well as the structure of the Galactic magnetic field and the scale of magnetic turbulence.
Most simulations of positron propagation have focused on
positrons produced within the Galactic plane, as this is
where the majority of potential sources lie. The results
of these simulations show that positrons with injection
energy E . 1 MeV do not propagate much farther than
1 kpc from their source for typical ISM conditions in the
plane [30].
However, unlike most Galactic positron sources, PBHs
are distributed in a spherical halo, so we must consider
the propagation of positrons produced at high latitudes
as well. The density of the ISM drops off exponentially
above the plane with a scale height of a few hundred
parsecs [33]. Since the lifetime for positrons propagating
through the ISM depends approximately linearly on the
density of the ISM (see Eq. 21 of Ref. [31]), the propagation distance of positrons increases with increasing height
above the Galactic plane.
The Galactic magnetic field is of order 1 µG [34], which
results in a gyroradius of order 10−11 kpc for a 1 MeV
positron. As a result, though positrons produced at high
latitudes may travel a further distance than those in the
plane, they are still tightly confined to magnetic field
lines. Their ultimate fate depends upon the large-scale
magnetic field structure out of the plane. For realistic models of the poloidal component, such as an A0
dipole [35, 36] or “X-shaped field” [37–39], the effect of
the magnetic field would be to guide roughly half the
positrons into the Bulge or Disk.
In order to place a robust bound, there are two potential situations we wish to avoid: 1) positrons produced in the Galactic plane escaping the Galaxy and 2)
positrons produced at high latitudes passing through the
Galactic plane and escaping without annihilating. As
stated above, simulation results demonstrate that 1 MeV
positrons do not propagate far from their source in the
Galactic plane, so to avoid these potential complications,
we choose to restrict the maximum injection energy of a
positron to be 1 MeV. This is very conservative as it is
not true that positrons with E > 1 MeV would necessarily escape the Galaxy without annihilating. For example,
if the Galactic magnetic field proves to have a large-scale
dipole component as suggested by Han et al. [35, 36],
positrons that escape the Disk would be funneled back
into the Bulge [40–42]. Note furthermore that the authors of Ref. [21] used a maximum positron energy of
13 (37) MeV for neutral (fully ionized) hydrogen in the
Galactic bulge when computing the positron annihilation
signal from PBHs, which is significantly less conservative
than the value we have chosen to adopt.
Though we place our final bounds with this conservative restriction, we also display a curve with no upper
bound on energy to indicate the potential region that
could be bounded by a more careful analysis of positron
propagation in the Galaxy (dotted line in Fig. 1). We

have not plotted this all-energy curve for our log-normal
bounds, but including all energies improves those bounds
in a similar fashion.

POSITRON PRODUCTION BY PBHS

In this section, we compute the low-energy (< 1 MeV)
positron production rate for all PBHs within our galaxy.

with TBH the temperature of the black hole and Γe
the electron absorption probability [26]. The absorption
probability is a complicated function for energies below
TBH that increases by an order of magnitude between
the low-temperature and high-temperature limit. The
dependence is displayed in Fig. 1 of Ref. [43]. In this
paper, we are mainly interested positrons that are produced fairly cold. We therefore must take into account
the low-temperature behavior as opposed to simply using
the high-energy, geometric optics limit Γe = 27G2 M 2 E 2
used frequently in similar analyses.
To determine the total production rate of positrons
due to PBHs, we perform the following integral over PBH
masses and positron energies to yield φinject , the Galactic
positron injection rate due to PBH radiation:

with NBH the number of black holes in the galaxy contributing to the positron flux and η(M ) the mass distribution function of the PBHs. Emin is taken to be me
and Emax to be 1 MeV for the reasons described in Section II. Mmin is set at 4 × 1014 g since black holes with
lower masses would have lifetimes less than the age of the
Universe and would have already evaporated.
To compute NBH , we choose to employ a sphericallysymmetric Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile [44] for
the galactic DM density

with the local dark matter density ρ = 0.4 GeV/cm3

where we take the upper limit of integration to be 15

bounds with a cored Burkert profile [46] and found that
the difference in the resulting bounds was less than 5%.

We compute bounds for both a monochromatic PBH
mass distribution and a log-normal distribution, a distribution predicted by mechanisms proposed in several
recent papers [47–49]. The log-normal mass distribution,
normalized to unity, is defined as

We now have a convenient expression to compute the
total positron injection into the galaxy as a function of
µ and σ (or M in the monochromatic case). By fixing
this injection rate at its upper limit, we can invert the
relation to place bounds on the mass spectrum of PBHs
in the Galaxy.
IV.

INTEGRAL BOUND

The current best measurements of the 511 keV line in
the Galaxy come from INTEGRAL, a space-based telescope in operation since 2002 [19]. INTEGRAL’s all-sky
map of the 511 keV emission has been used to study potential spatial morphologies for positron annihilation in
the Galaxy. INTEGRAL’s measurement limits the total
production rate of positrons within the Galaxy to less
than ≈ 2 × 1043 e+ s−1 [40, 50].
The origin of these positrons is as-of-yet not fully understood, though there is a plethora of proposed sources
(see Ref. [40] for a comprehensive review and Ref. [51]
for a more recent proposal). Many of the proposed
sources are subject to considerable uncertainty on their
production rate and their relative contribution to the total Galactic positron flux. The most relevant sources of
uncertainty come from the injection rate by 56 Ni decays
produced in Type Ia supernovae and the injection rate
from low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXRBs) since both of
these sources can potentially saturate the INTEGRAL
bound (2 × 1043 e+ s−1 ) for optimistic choices of parameters [40]. Contributions from other sources are in
general an order of magnitude smaller than this, e.g.
positron production by 24 Ti decays, which is measured to
be ≈ 3 × 1042 e+ s−1 . For a thorough discussion of each
potential positron source and its associated uncertainties,
see Section IV of Ref. [40].
It is important to note that these astrophysical uncertainties do not affect the bounds presented in this paper,
as we do not attempt to add PBH injection on top of existing production mechanisms. Rather, we place a bound
by asserting that regardless of other sources and their

respective contributions, it is not possible for PBHs to
inject twice INTEGRAL’s total measured positron production rate into the Galaxy, as this would conflict with
observation independent of the contribution of any other
sources. One could attempt to place a significantly more
stringent bound on PBH positron injection by combining it with other known positron sources in the Galaxy,
however due to the aforementioned uncertainties associated with these sources, the resulting bound would not
be robust. We have chosen to adopt a very conservative
limit in order to avoid this issue.
Since attempting to fully model the propagation of
positrons produced by PBHs is beyond the scope of this
paper, the most conservative assumption we can make in
regards to the spatial morphology of their annihilation
would be to assume it matches the best-fitting model of
positron annihilation. By assuming this, the positron annihilation signal from PBHs must exceed the overall flux
measured by INTEGRAL to be constrained (instead of
simply altering the all-sky pattern of emission), resulting
in the weakest possible bounds on PBH abundance.1
Using this assumption, the positron annihilation rate
implied by INTEGRAL’s measurement of the 511 keV
line can be used to limit the rate at which PBHs could
be injecting positrons into the Galaxy. Since we wish to
restrict ourselves to positrons that will annihilate in the
Galaxy without the potential for escape (see Section II),
we place a constraint by conservatively taking the limit
on the injection rate of < 1 MeV positrons by all PBHs in
the Galaxy to be 4 × 1043 s−1 (twice INTEGRAL’s measured rate). This allows us to bound PBHs in a straightforward manner. The fraction of DM in the Galaxy that
could be composed of PBHs such that this injection rate
is not exceeded is simply f = (4 × 1043 s−1 )/φinject , with
φinject appropriately restricted in energy. With this, we
can readily compute the bounds on PBHs using Eq. 3
and Eq. 7 for log-normal and monochromatic mass distributions respectively.
Note that the low temperature of the PBHs of interest
in this paper means that any potential bound using the
in-flight annihilation of positrons such as those employed
by Refs. [52] and [53] would be significantly weaker than
the bound on the overall 511 keV flux presented here, as
these constraints only begin to apply to positrons with
injection energies above 3 − 7.5 MeV.

1

It should be noted that we do not in general expect the positron
annihilation signal from PBHs to have the same spatial morphology as the measured 511 keV line. A PBH signal would likely
be less peaked towards the center of the Galaxy than the INTEGRAL measurement since PBHs would be injecting positrons
throughout the DM halo, not just in the Galactic bulge. However, in the absence of sufficient data on the large-scale magnetic
field structure of the Galaxy, attempting to model the propagation of the positrons and their ultimate annihilation sites is prone
to large uncertainty. While the bound that could be placed by
modeling propagation would be stronger than the one presented
in this paper, it would be less robust.

Fraction of DM

Our results are displayed in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. In Fig. 1,
we focus exclusively on the case of a monochromatic mass
distribution for comparison to existing bounds. The region is bounded above by f = 1 since above this line,
the abundance of PBHs would exceed the measured density of DM. To lower masses, there is an existing bound
from observations of both the extragalactic and Galactic
gamma ray flux [24, 25] as well as the recent constraint
using observations of high-energy positrons by the Voyager spacecraft [26]. Note that these bounds are worse
than the positron bound discussed in this paper (shown
in green) due to the fact that at higher PBH mass, the
PBH is cooler and therefore high-energy gamma rays and
positrons become Boltzmann-suppressed. In contrast,
the positron bound discussed here is based upon lowenergy positrons that can annihilate and contribute to
the 511 keV line, hence provides stronger constraints for
colder (more massive) PBHs.
We have also included a dotted line denoting the region that would be excluded if we did not restrict the
positron injection energy to <1 MeV. It is clear that towards lower masses where the average energy of emitted
positrons is much higher, this would dramatically improve the bounds. As a result, a more careful analysis
of positron propagation and annihilation in the Galaxy
would have the potential to place significantly stronger
constraints.
It is worth additionally remarking that, though attempts to use femtolensing of gamma-ray bursts to place
bounds at higher masses have been made, recent reviews have suggested that the assumptions made in these
bounds are inappropriate and any bounds disappear
when computed carefully [54]. As a result, the limits
from these papers are not shown.
In Fig. 2, we have plotted the limits for a log-normal
mass distribution function with two values of σ (0.1 and
0.5 in blue and red respectively). It is clear that for
these values of σ, the positron bound places stronger
constraints than existing bounds (taken from Ref. [26])
at the high-mass end. However, as the distribution becomes wider, the high-energy tail of positrons improves
the Voyager bounds while not significantly affecting the
511 keV line bounds. As such, beyond σ ≈ 1, the Voyager
bounds are more restrictive than our positron injection
bound for all masses.

mass range. Future measurements of the Galactic magnetic field structure and distribution of ISM subcomponents would allow the conservative assumptions used in
this paper to be relaxed, potentially resulting in even
stronger constraints.

CONCLUSION
Acknowledgements

Using the positron annihilation rate implied by INTEGRAL’s measurements of the Galactic 511 keV line, we
have placed strong constraints on the fraction of dark
matter that can be comprised of primordial black holes
in the mass range 1016 −1017 g. We show that such PBHs
cannot comprise the entirety of dark matter and improve
constraints on both monochromatic and log-normal mass
