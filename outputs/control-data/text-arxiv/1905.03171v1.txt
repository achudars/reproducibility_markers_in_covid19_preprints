ABSTRACT
We are witness to a great and increasing interest in internal structure, composition and evolution
of exoplanets. However, direct measurements of exoplanetary mass and radius cannot be uniquely
interpreted in terms of interior structure, justifying the need for an additional observable. The second
degree fluid Love number, k2 , is proportional to the concentration of mass towards the body’s center, hence providing valuable additional information about the internal structure. When hydrostatic
equilibrium is assumed for the planetary interior, k2 is a direct function of the planetary shape. Previous attempts were made to link the observed tidally and rotationally induced planetary oblateness
in photometric light curves to k2 using ellipsoidal shape models. Here, we construct an analytical 3D
shape model function of the true planetary mean radius, that properly accounts for tidal and rotational
deformations. Measuring the true planetary mean radius is critical when one wishes to compare the
measured k2 to interior theoretical expectations. We illustrate the feasibility of our method and show,
by applying
√ a Differential Evolution Markov Chain to synthetic data of WASP-121b, that a precision ≤
65 ppm/ 2 min is required to reliably retrieve k2 with present understanding of stellar limb darkening,
therefore improving recent results based on ellipsoidal shape models. Any improvement on stellar limb
darkening would increase such performance.

1. INTRODUCTION

Knowledge of the planetary radius and mass is not sufficient to infer the interior structure, as different composition and density profiles can lead to the same solution
(e.g. Rogers & Seager 2010), showing the need for additional observables. About 50% of the about 2800 confirmed transiting exoplanets orbit their host star in less
than 10 days 1 . Such close-in objects undergo strong
tidal and rotational deformations, which modify their

shapes from spherical to more complicated ones. We
try to interpret the shape in terms of the internal structure parameters kj , where kj is the fluid Love number
of degree j, introduced by Love (1911). Therefore, we
present our recently developed model in which we assume a spherical host star and a planet in hydrostatic
equilibrium, i.e., behaving as a fluid at rest. In particular, the second-degree Love number, k2 , is an indication
of mass concentration towards the body’s center, providing additional information about the interior (see,
e.g., Kellermann et al. 2018). A value of k2 = 0 indicates a mass-point approximation (a.k.a., Roche model),
k2 = 1.5 corresponds to a fully homogeneous body, and
its full derivation depends on the internal radial den-

sity profile, (see, e.g., Padovan et al. 2018). As a result
of tidal and rotational deformations, the stellar eclipsed
area during transit will differ from a transiting sphere,
modifying the corresponding transit light curve (Hui &
Seager 2002; Seager & Hui 2002). Hence, one should be
able to improve our understanding of planetary internal
structure by measuring the planetary shape from transit
light curves.
Previous work focused on transit light curves of oblate
planets, defined either through two-axes ellipsoids (e.g.
Carter & Winn 2010) or three-axes ellipsoids (e.g. Correia 2014; Maxted 2016; Akinsanmi et al. 2018). When
compared to a transiting sphere, distortions in photometric light curves were identified mainly at ingress and
egress phases of the transit due to polar oblateness. The
latter, often called flattening, was then related to the interior through k2 or through the quadrupole moment J2
(Carter & Winn 2010; Correia 2014)).
In this paper, we first construct a three-dimensional analytical shape model based on the theories of Love (1911)
and Kopal (1959), that properly accounts for tidal and
rotational deformations. This model presents the advantage of depending on the true planetary mean radius, an essential parameter when computing theoretical k2 based on interior models (see, e.g., Padovan et al.
2018). The true planetary mean radius is the radius Rp
as defined in Equation (14). Thus, it corresponds to the
(spherical) radius the planet would have if it were isolated and non-rotating. We also show that ultra-short
period planets or planets with potentially fast rotation
rates are the most suitable targets to constrain k2 from
photometric transit light curves. We then describe our
algorithm to compute transit light curves and apply a
Differential Evolution Markov Chain (ter Braak & Vrugt
2008) to illustrate the feasibility of measuring exoplanetary shapes by taking the example of WASP-121b in
the light of dedicated space missions.

2. SHAPE MODEL

We assume circular orbits and do not account for
interactions between rotation and tides, which are in
general terms of second order or higher (Landin et al.
2009). Below we derive the planetary surface shape
(subscript p), and one can derive the stellar shape (subscript s) by an obvious interchange of signs. We define
the usual Cartesian coordinate system, with its origin at
the planet’s center of mass, the x-axis pointing towards
the star’s center of mass, the z-axis perpendicular to the
orbital plane, and the y-axis to form a right-handed system. We define a spherical coordinate system, with the
same origin, where at point P the coordinates are radius

r, colatitude θ, and east longitude φ, so that
x = rλ = r sin θ cos φ,

(1)

y = rµ = r sin θ sin φ,

(2)

z = rν = r cos θ.

(3)

The tidal potential at the planetary surface, Vt , can be
expanded in spherical harmonics as (e.g. Kopal 1959)
j
∞ 
Gms X Rp
Vt =
Pj (λ),
d j=2 d

(4)

where G is the gravitational constant, ms is the stellar
mass, d is the orbital semi-major axis, Rp is the true
planetary mean radius, and Pj is the Legendre polynomial of degree j. Kopal (1959) showed that omitting
terms with degree j ≤ 4 is equivalent to considering the
Roche model, which describes the behavior of a masspoint surrounded by a massless envelope (see, e.g., Wilson & Devinney 1971).
We consider the general case where the spin axis is not
perpendicular to the orbital plane. We define the obliquity, Θ, as the angle between the arbitrary radius vector
given by λ, µ, ν and the spin axis whose direction is given
by
0

λ = sin β cos α,

µ = sin β sin α,

where α and β are the longitude and co-latitude of the
spin axis, respectively. Hence, Θ is given by

We note here that the fluid Love number kj (hj = 1+kj )
is twice the apsidal motion constant in Kopal (1959)
(also indicated as kj ) and that hj is equal to the parameter ∆j in Kopal (1959). The effect of the interior
is entirely enclosed in the fluid Love numbers kj , or
equivalently hj .
Equation (14) also applies to the star by switching the
origin of the coordinate system at the stellar center of
mass, by interchanging the subscript p with s (including
in the mass ratio q), and by taking the stellar fluid Love
numbers (see, e.g., Claret 2004).
We validate our model by verifying that for k2,3,4 = 0,
we obtain the Roche model. Additionally, we retrieve
the shape of solar system planets that exhibit a polar
flattening (e.g. the Earth and Jupiter for which we
considered k2 = 0.934 Lambeck (1980) and k2 = 0.537
Wahl et al. (2016), respectively).
Our three-dimensional model properly accounts for tidal
and rotational deformations and does not require any
approximations except hydrostatic equilibrium in the
interior and absence of non-linear effects in the planetary response to perturbations. It allows to directly
fit the true planetary mean radius, the fluid Love numbers, the rotational period (enclosed in Fp ), and the
spin obliquity from observations. This is a major improvement compared to previous and recent works (e.g.

3

Carter & Winn 2010; Correia 2014; Zhu et al. 2014;
Maxted 2016; Akinsanmi et al. 2018). The derivation
of the true planetary mean radius is critical as it enters
the calculation of theoretically expected k2 .
The shape modeling adopted in this paper differs from
ellipsoidal shape models, leading to different planetary
deformations. These differences appear in turn in transit light curves and, as a result, the noise level at which
one can safely measure k2 will differ, as reported in
Section 4. In Appendix A we compare some planetary
shapes calculated by Correia (2014) with those obtained
using our model.
The larger the planetary surface deformations, the easier the retrieval of k2 from transit light curves. The dimensionless absolute quantities that give gravitational
acceleration in comparison to that of rotational and
tidal are respectively given by (Kellermann et al. 2018)

Hence, surface deformations for synchronously locked
close-in planets are tidally dominated (qt /qr ' 3), while
for outer planets with fast spin rates, surface deformations are rotationally dominated (qr /qt ' Fp2 /3), for
instance Jupiter and Saturn or see Zhu et al. (2014) for
exoplanets. Therefore, planets orbiting close to their
Roche limit - the distance at which the tidal forces will
overcome the planet’s gravity and lead to its tidal disruption - (synchronously locked or not) and outer planets with fast rotation rates are the best candidates to
measure their fluid Love number k2 .
3. RETRIEVAL OF k2 IN TRANSIT LIGHT

CURVES
For the sake of illustration and based on the criteria
mentioned previously, we consider the object WASP121b, a hot Jupiter with a mean density of ρ = 0.201 ±
0.010 ρJ orbiting at roughly twice its Roche limit. We
assume a planetary synchronous rotation and a spherical star with a quadratic limb darkening law (u1 = u2 =
0.3) (Claret & Bloemen 2011). Our model, however,
allows the user to choose between several limb darkening laws so that the preferred one (based on, e.g., chisquare or Bayesian information) can be adopted. The
main assumed properties of the planet and its host star
are summarized in Table 1. We emphasize that the assumed radius ratio Rp /Rs given in Table 1 corresponds
to the true normalized planetary mean radius in our
shape model, a priori unknown. This radius differs
from the one retrieved through a spherical fitting procedure. We considered a planetary Love number k2 = 0.5

synthetic light curves were created to prove the feasibility of our method, not real data, thus our results should
not be physically interpreted in terms of, e.g., internal
structure.

precision on the eclipsed area is required. After implementing our model in Python, one transit simulation
took about 450 ms with a precision of 1 ppm on a 2.40
GHz Intel Core i7 Toshiba Satellite (running on Ubuntu
18.04 LTS).

3.1. Forward modeling
To derive a single transit event, the stellar eclipsed
area is derived by projecting the planetary shape onto
the plane-of-sky. We define the plane-of-sky coordinate
system, centered at the star’s center of mass, with the
x-axis pointing towards the observer, the z-axis perpendicular to the x-axis and pointing up, and the y-axis
to form a right-handed system. By denoting i the orbital inclination, and ϕ the orbital phase, the y and z
sky-projected planetary coordinates normalized to the
semi-major axis, ysky and zsky , are given by
ysky (ϕ) = x sin ϕ − y cos ϕ + sin ϕ

(16)

zsky (ϕ) = x cos i cos ϕ + y cos i sin ϕ + z sin i (17)
− cos i cos ϕ
The stellar eclipsed area is simply the overlapping contour of the sky-projected planetary shape with the stellar spherical contour. This area being non-analytical,
we uniformly sample it using a two dimensional Sobol
sequence (Sobol & Levitan 1999) and the stellar flux
deficit is computed using a Monte-Carlo integration.
The latter takes most of the computing time as a high

For illustration purpose, we present in Figure 1 two
modeled transit light curves for k2 = 0.3 and k2 = 0.5,
as well as their difference, and the difference in the stellar eclipsed area. It is clear from Figure 1 (top panel)
that the planetary mean radius and k2 are degenerate as
a larger radius could explain most of the difference between both light curves. It is essential to note that the
whole transit has to be carefully monitored to precisely
retrieve k2 . Therefore, the knowledge of the stellar limb
darkening will be critical (see Section 4).
To be able to measure the planetary shape in transit
light curves, we need a good enough time resolution and
low noise (as shown in Figure 1). Therefore, we calculate photometric white noise levels (i.e. photon noise),
σ, for a composite light curve from 10 observed transits,
binned into 2-min intervals, for several observing facilities. For a given noise level, σref , corresponding to a
reference time tref , we calculate σ using

since photon noise is equal to the square root of the
number of photons received during tref . The values are
reported in Table √
2. We considered an additional noise
level of 200 ppm/ 2min to have a value between those
of CHEOPS and TESS. These white noise levels are then
randomly added using a simple Gaussian distribution to
create synthetic light curves for each observing facility.
We create three realizations of noisy light curve for each
facility, and report the average values of these realizations. An example is presented in Figure 2.

3.2. Retrieval of k2
The parametrization for transit fitting has been done
in different ways in the literature. We decide to fit the
inclination, i, the sum and difference of the quadratic
limb darkening coefficients up = u1 + u2 and um =
u1 −u2 , the normalized semi-major axis (in stellar radii)
d/Rs , the normalized true mean planetary radius (in
stellar radii) Rp /Rs , and the second degree fluid Love
number k2 . We forced the third and fourth degree planetary fluid Love numbers to 0. By assuming the probability distribution of uncertainties to be Gaussian, and
assuming uncorrelated uncertainties, the quantity to be
minimized is χ2 and given by

where O and M are the observed and modeled data
sets, of n data points, respectively. We robustly find a
local minimum employing the downhill simplex method
(Nelder & Mead 1965). We then wish to estimate
the goodness of the fit by performing a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Two major problems
arose when using a conventional Metropolis-Hastings
MCMC algorithm: the correlation between the normalized planetary mean radius Rp /Rs and the k2 (see
Discussions), and the computing time. By recalling that
one transit simulation takes about 450 ms, a random
walk Metropolis of 3 chains, each consisting of 1 million
steps, would take roughly 15 days without parallelizing
the chains and 5 days with parallelization, assuming
convergence would be reached. We found that a random walk Metropolis is not efficient in taking care of
the previously mentioned correlation, leading to very
long computing times. We solved this issue by using
the so-called Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DEMC) with snooker updater (ter Braak & Vrugt 2008).
It solves the problem of choosing an appropriate scale
and orientation for the jumping distribution by using
the past states of each chains. Cubillos et al. (2017)
implemented a parallelized version of the algorithm in
a Python library called MC3 . For each case we used 12
chains, each consisting of roughly 41500 steps (500,000
steps in total). The convergence was checked through a
Gelman-Rubin test by ensuring that R̂ < 1.01 for every
parameters (Gelman & Rubin 1992). The peak of the
posterior distribution defines the best solution, while
the uncertainties are estimated by the 68% confidence
intervals.
The adopted priors on the fitted parameters are reported in Table 3. In order to investigate the impact
of stellar limb darkening uncertainty, we considered two
cases: Gaussian priors with standard deviations of 0.01
and 0.005. In doing so, we can compare our results to
recently published performances with ellipsoidal shape
models (Akinsanmi et al. 2018). A discussion about the
accuracy of our present knowledge of limb darkening can
be found in Csizmadia et al. (2013), which can be used as
a baseline for the above choices of standard deviations.
4. DISCUSSION

In Figure 3 we present the average values of the three
realizations for each facility, in terms of mean and standard deviation of the measured k2 , for both considered
priors on the limb darkening coefficients. We also show
the posterior distributions of k2 of all realizations to
assess the quality of the parameter estimation. The
measured value must be precise and accurate to con-

fidently say that the model can retrieve k2 . Thus, we
require a precision of at least 2σ and a relative error
|k2 − 0.5|/0.5 ≤ 5%.
For a well constrained stellar limb darkening, we get
a least a 2σ detection with
5%, for
√ a relative error < √
noise levels up to 63 ppm/ 2 min. At 71 ppm/ 2 min
we also obtain a 2σ detection of k2 , but with a relative
error of about 9%. For higher noise levels, the relative
error drastically drops and the posterior distributions of
k2 widen and flatten, covering the whole physical range
[0; 1.5] (see Figure 3(a)).
When the accuracy on the limb darkening coefficients
decreases (Figure 3(b)), we are√able to reliably recover
k2 with a noise level of 23 ppm/ 2 min only. For higher

noise values, the precision and relative error decidedly
decrease. We present in Appendix B posterior distributions of all fitted parameters for few realizations at
different noise levels, for both limb darkening priors.
We notice that the degeneracy between limb darkening (LD) and k2 can disappear in the future due to
progress in LD studies. Once LD is well known, limb
darkening coefficients (LDCs) can be fixed or strict priors can be applied. The difference between observed and
theoretically predicted LDCs were reported and summarized in, e.g., Claret (2008, 2009), and Csizmadia
et al. (2013). Csizmadia et al. (2013) also emphasized
that stellar spots - surface manifestation of the stellar
magnetic field - will modify the LDCs of theoretical
tables, which has been confirmed by recent case studies
(Maxted 2018, 2019). We also note that LDCs can be
measured if the transit depth is at least 400 times larger
than the photometric noise (Csizmadia et al. 2013).
Therefore, we think that the degeneracy between LD
and k2 is temporary, and will be removed by further LD
studies with focus on the impact of stellar activity on
LDCs.

ellipsoidal shape model √
from Correia (2014), that a

light curves of WASP-103b and WASP-121b. For a
Vmag = 10.4 star, that would require around 40 transits
and 27 transits with CHEOPS and PLATO, respectively
(Table 2). We found in this paper that one can safely recover k2 in transit light curves of√WASP-121b with noise
levels as √
high as about 65 ppm/ 2 min (or equivalently
90 ppm/ 1 min), improving the performance by almost
a factor 2. This would require only 13 observed transit
with CHEOPS, and 10 observed transits with PLATO.
To reach such performances, errors smaller than 0.01 on
the limb darkening coefficients are required. This is in
agreement with Akinsanmi et al. (2018).
We highlight here that the maximum noise level at which
one can safely retrieve k2 depends on how strongly the
planet deforms. Hence, for a hot Jupiter orbiting a
little further from its Roche limit, e.g. WASP-103b or
WASP-12b, that maximum
noise level should not be
√
higher than 65 ppm/ 2 min.
Our study solely considers the ideal case of pure white
noise. In reality other noise sources may be present in
the data, e.g. stellar granulation (Chiavassa et al. 2017)
or inhomogeneities in the stellar photosphere (Pont
et al. 2007), which would require lower noise levels
(higher number of transits) to reach the precision in k2
presented above. Such non-gaussian noises would be
fitted through gaussian processes (Foreman-Mackey et
al. 2017) or wavelet analysis (Carter & Winn 2009).

It is true that not all observing facilities are primarily designed to observe gas giants. However, based
on the results presented above, one can propose to
observe WASP-121b and similar targets with JWST,
PLATO and CHEOPS. To perform such observations
from ground, one would have to consider the absorption
of light due to the Earth atmosphere, the scintillation,
as well as the atmospheric variability (e.g. turbulence,
clouds, dust, pressure). These combined effects would
inevitably increase the need for a larger telescope diameter and would require techniques such as adaptive
optics to reach space-based noise levels.
For outer planets however, not only the rotational rate
is important but also the spin axis tilt. For instance,
Zhu et al. (2014) showed that the spin axis obliquity
alone may have a big influence on the amplitude of
oblateness-induced effects. Hence, a more exhaustive
study of the parameter space is needed for outer planets
where surface deformations are dominated by rotation.
One may wish to apply the method presented in this
paper to super Earths and Neptune-like planets. However, such objects being much smaller and less easily
deformable (e.g. layers of finite rigidity) than Jupiterlike planets, surface deformations are by consequences
smaller, making the retrieval of k2 harder.

8

Hellard et al.

We assumed in our model a spherical star. In reality, the stellar disk is also non spherical due to the
stellar rotation and tidal interactions with the planet
(e.g. Barnes (2009)). Such baseline variations of the
stellar flux may have an impact on the planetary shape
retrieval, and thus should be investigated.
5. CONCLUSION

Close-in planets are subjected to large tidal distortions, while outer planets remaining in fast rotational
rate are subjected to large rotational distortions. These
effects lead to surface deformations, for which we provide a complete three-dimensional analytical model.
The departure from spherical shape induces distortions
in transit light curves, whose magnitude depends on the
planetary interior model, expressed through the fluid
Love numbers kj (or equivalently hj ). Our shape model
is valid for arbitrary orbital and rotational configuration
or spin rates, and allows direct fitting of the true planetary mean radius, and fluid Love number k2 . Considering the close-in hot Jupiter WASP-121b as a test case we
showed that, under present understanding
of stellar limb
√
darkening,
a
precision
≤
65
ppm/
2
min
(equivalently
√
90 ppm/ 1 min) is required to reliably retrieve k2 . We
thereby improve the performance by almost a factor 2
compared to results using three-axis ellipsoidal shape
models. Such a noise level can be achieved by CHEOPS
in 13 observed transits, by PLATO in 10 observed transits, and by JWST in only two observed transit. Kepler
was able to reach that precision in 5 observed transits.
However, TESS would reach such a precision after 320
observed transits. On the other hand, TESS may detect
a new target around a brighter star than WASP-121,
hence requiring a lower number of observed transits to
reach the required precision for Love number measurements. A careful treatment of noise sources is critical
to achieve reliable measurements of k2 , and any improvement on stellar limb darkening would increase the
performances summarized above. Such measurements
would allow to further constrain exoplanetary internal
structures by comparing the measured k2 to theoretical
interior model expectations.

APPENDIX
A. DIFFERENCE IN SHAPE MODELS

In Table 4 we compare some planetary shapes calculated by Correia (2014) with those obtained using our model,
for which an initial value of k2 is given as input: k2,input = 0.5 for gaseous planets and k2,input = 1.0 for rocky
planets (Yoder 1995). Synchronous rotation is assumed for all cases (Fp = 1). We define Rsub = r(θ = 90◦ , φ = 0◦ ),
Ranti = r(θ = 90◦ , φ = 180◦ ), Rtrail = r(θ = 90◦ , φ = 90◦ ), and Rpole = r(θ = 0◦ , φ = 0◦ ). The equivalence is
a ↔ Rsub , b ↔ Rtrail , and c ↔ Rpole . We compute radii values up to three digits as this is a common precision in
exoplanetary observations.
