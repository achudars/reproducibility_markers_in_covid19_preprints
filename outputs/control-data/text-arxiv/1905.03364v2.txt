Abstract. In the present paper, we study the Bethe ansatz equations for Gaudin model
and Miura opers in characteristic p > 0. Our study is based on a work by E. Frenkel, in
which solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations are described in terms of Miura opers on the
complex projective line. The main result of the present paper provides a positive characteristic
analogue of this description. We pay particular attention to the case of Miura PGL2 -opers
because dormant generic Miura PGL2 -opers correspond bijectively to Tango structures, which
bring various sorts of pathological phenomena in positive characteristic (e.g., counter-examples
to the Kodaira vanishing theorem). As a consequence, we can construct new examples of Tango
structures by means of solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations modulo p.

Introduction
In the present paper, we study the Bethe ansatz equations for Gaudin model and Miura
opers in characteristic p > 0. Recall (cf. [1], § 3.2, (3.5)) that the Bethe ansatz equations for a
simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra g over C are the system of equations on the set of distinct
complex numbers z1 , · · · , zm (m ≥ 1) of the form

Hamiltonian of a certain spin model called the Gaudin model. It gives an effective way to
solve the problem of simultaneous diagonalization of the Gaudin Hamiltonian. On the other
hand, the Bethe Ansatz equations may be also interpreted as a “monodromy-free” condition
on Miura opers. A Miura oper (cf. § 1.3) is, by definition, an oper equipped with additional
data, or somewhat more precisely, a torsor over an algebraic curve equipped with two Borel
reductions and a flat connection satisfying some conditions (including a certain transversality
condition). For example, PGL2 -opers and Miura PGL2 -opers on an algebraic curve over C
may be identified with, respectively, projective and affine structures on the associated Riemann surface. In a work by E. Frenkel (cf. [1] and [2]), a canonical correspondence between
solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations and certain Miura opers with trivial monodromy on
the complex projective line was constructed. Our study is based on this correspondence.
In the present paper, we consider the Bethe ansatz equations and an analogous correspondence given by Frenkel in the case of characteristic p > 0. (For the previous study of the Bethe
ansatz equations, we refer to [14].) Unfortunately, we are not able to apply directly the proofs
of some results in [1] or [2] to our discussion because of the positive characteristic nature of
the various objects involved. Indeed, on a flat connection in characteristic p, the property of
having trivial monodromy is not sufficient to characterize the local triviality. Although our
situation is rather different from the case over C in this sense, we can prove an analogue of
Frenkel’s correspondence in positive characteristic (cf. Theorem 2.5), which is the main result
of the present paper. Moreover, solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations of a certain type
turn out to correspond bijectively to dormant generic Miura PGL2 -opers on the projective
line P (equipped with a log structure), i.e., generic Miura PGL2 -opers on P with vanishing pcurvature. (For the previous works concerning dormant Miura opers, we refer to [17] and [18].)
On the other hand, according to a previous work by the author (cf. [17], Theorem A), dormant
generic PGL2 -opers are in bijection with (pre-)Tango structures. Recall that a (pre-)Tango
structure (cf. Definition 3.1 (i) or Definition 3.3 for the precise definition) is defined as a
certain line bundle on an algebraic curve (or equivalently, a certain connection on the sheaf
of 1-forms) and brings various sorts of pathological phenomena in positive characteristic. In
fact, we can construct, by means of a curve together with a Tango structure, an algebraic surface forming a counter-example to the Kodaira vanishing theorem. By combining the results
mentioned above, we obtain a bijective correspondence between certain Tango structures on
the projective line and solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations.
We shall describe the main theorem of the present paper. Let k be an algebraically closed
field of characteristic p > 0, G a connected simple algebraic group over k of adjoint type satisfying the condition (∗)G (cf. § 1.1 for the precise definition of “(∗)G ”). Let x := (x1 , · · · , xr+1 )
(r ≥ 0) be an ordered collection of r + 1 distinct closed points of P with xr+1 = ∞. Also,
λ := (λ̌1 , · · · , λ̌r+1 ) be an element of (tFdom )r+1 (cf. (12) for the definition of tFdom ) and
let λ̌
α := (α1 , · · · , αm ) an element of Γm , where m ≥ 1 and Γ denotes the set of simple positive
roots with respect to a fixed maximal torus of G. Suppose that these collections of data satisfy
the following equality

consisting of generic Miura G-opers satisfying a monodromy-free condition (resp., dormant
generic G-opers) on P equipped with a log structure. The precise definition of this set can be
seen in (cf. (35) (resp., (39)). Since any G-torsor equipped with a connection having vanishing
p-curvature may be locally trivialized, the condition of being dormant is stronger than the
monodromy-free condition. In fact, as proved in Proposition 2.2, (i), there exists a canonical
injection

From the above result for G = PGL2 , we obtain an application to the problem of constructing
Tango structures. As mentioned earlier, a Tango structure has an important feature that it
induces an algebraic surface violating the Kodaira vanishing theorem and other reasonable
theorems proved in characteristic 0 (cf. [17], § 7.2 for the construction of such surfaces by
means of Tango structures). To the author’s knowledge, there are unfortunately very few
examples of Tango curves described explicitly at the present time. In fact, the existence of
a Tango structure implies a strong restriction to the genus g of the underlying curve, i.e., p
must divide 2g − 2. At any rate, it will be natural to ask how many curves admitting a Tango
structure exist, or whether such curves are really exceptional or not. By applying Theorem A

4

YASUHIRO WAKABAYASHI

and the correspondence between Tango structures and dormant Miura PGL2 proved in [17], we
can construct (cf. Theorem B below) infinitely many examples of Tango curves, i.e., algebraic
curves admitting a Tango structure (cf. Definition 3.1 (ii)). The major ones given by M.
Raynaud (cf. [12], Example, or [8], Example 1.3) may be thought of as special cases of our
construction, and we provide other new Tango curves. As a consequence of the present paper,
any solution to the Bethe ansatz equations of a certain type with coefficients in a field k of
positive characteristic associates a pathological algebraic surface over k.
To formulate the following theorem, let us keep
before, but suppose further
 1 the notation

that G = PGL2 and p ≥ 3. Then, we have ρ̌ = 2
, and Γ is a singleton consisting of
0 − 12
an element α (hence αj = α for every j) with α̌ = 2ρ̌. Our result is described as follows.
Theorem B (cf. Theorem 3.9).
Suppose that r = 0 and we are given a pair of positive integers (a, b) with gcd(a, bp−1) = 1 and
m = ap. Let (z1 , · · · , zap ) be a solution to the Bethe ansatz equation classified by PGL2 -BA0,αα
(without imposing the equality (2)). Denote by Y the desingularization of the plane curve
defined by the equation

1. Opers and Miura opers
In this section, we recall the definitions of an oper and a (generic) Miura oper.
1.1. Algebraic groups and Lie algebras.
Throughout the present paper, let us fix a prime p and an algebraically closed field k of
characteristic p. Also, let G be a connected simple algebraic group over k of adjoint type
satisfying the condition (∗)G described as follows.
(∗)G : G is either equal to PGLn with 1 < n < p or satisfies the inequality p > 2 · h, where h
denotes the Coxeter number of G.
Next, let us fix a maximal torus T of G, a Borel subgroup B of G containing T . Write
N = [B, B], i.e., the unipotent radical of B, and write W for the Weyl group of (G, T ).
Denote by g, b, n, and t the Lie algebras of G, B, N, and T respectively (hence t, n ⊆ b ⊆ g).
Denote by Φ+ the set of positive roots in B with respect to T and by Φ− the set of negative

roots. Also, denote by Γ (⊆ Φ+ ) the set of simple positive roots. In what follows, given
each character ϕ : T → Gm (resp., each cocharacter ϕ̌ : Gm → T ), we shall use, by abuse of
notation, the same notation ϕ (resp., ϕ̌) to denote its differential dϕ ∈ t∨ (resp., dϕ̌ ∈ t). For
each α ∈ Φ+ ∪ Φ− , we write

(10)
gα := x ∈ g ad(t)(x) = α(t) · x for all t ∈ T .

Each g−α (α ∈ Γ) may be thought of as a subspace of g/b closed under the adjoint B-action.
Lrk(g)
Here, recall the principal gradation g =
from the operator ad(ρ̌)
i=−rk(g) gi , which arises

(cf. [3], § 4.2.4); this gradation restricts to identifications t = g0 , α∈Γ gα = g1 , α∈Γ g−α =

g−1 , and n = i=1
WePshall write ρ̌ for the cocharacter Gm → T (as well as its differential) defined as the
sum α∈Γ ω̌α , where each ω̌α (α ∈ Γ) denotes the fundamental coweight of α. In the P
following
discussion, we shall fix a generator fα of g−α for each α ∈ Γ. Hence, we obtain p−1 := α∈Γ fα .
If treg denotes the set of regular elements in t, then it follows from [7], Chap. VI, Theorem
7.2, that

(11)
treg = λ̌ ∈ t | α(λ̌) 6= 0 for any root α ∈ Φ+ ∪ Φ− .
We shall write tFreg for the set of F -invariant elements in treg , where F denotes the absolute
Frobenius morphism of treg viewed as a k-scheme. Also, write

(12)
tFdom := λ̌ ∈ t λ̌ + ρ̌ ∈ tFred .

1.2. Opers.
In this subsection, we recall the definitions of an oper. Let X be a connected proper smooth
curve over k. Given a reduced effective divisor D on X, one can equip X with a log structure
determined by D in the usual manner; we shall denote the resulting log scheme by X D-log . (In
particular, if D = 0, then X D-log coincides with X.) Let G0 be some algebraic group G0 over
k, E a (right) G0 -torsor over X. Given a k-vector space h equipped with a (left) G0 -action,
we shall write hE for the vector bundle on X associated with the relative affine space E ×G0 h
(:= (E ×k h)/G0 ) over X. We shall refer to any logarithmic connection on E (with respect to
the log structure of X D-log ) as a D-log connection on E.
Let X, D be as above, and G as in the previous subsection. Also, let E be a (right) G-torsor
over X. The adjoint G-action on g gives rise to a vector bundle gE . Next, suppose that we
are given a D-log connection ∇ on E and a B-reduction EB of E (i.e., a B-torsor EB over X
∼
together with an isomorphism EB ×B G → E of G-torsors). Let us choose, locally on X, a
D-log connection ∇′ on E preserving EB , and take the difference ∇ − ∇′ , which forms a section
of gEB ⊗ ΩX D-log /k (∼
= gE ⊗ ΩX D-log /k ). The local section of (g/b)EB ⊗ ΩX D-log /k determined by
this section via projection is independent of the choice ∇′ . Hence, these sections may be glued
together to a global section of (g/b)EB ⊗ ΩX D-log /k , denoted by ∇/EB .
By a G-oper on X D-log , we mean a triple E ♠ := (E,
where E, ∇, and EB are as above
L∇, EB ),

we refer to an isomorphism E1 → E2 compatible with both the respective connections and
B-reductions as an isomorphism of G-opers (from E1♠ to E2♠ ). Denote by

(13)

the set of isomorphism classes of G-opers on X D-log .
b be a complete discrete valuation ring over k, and write D := Spec(O)
b (i.e., the

formal disc). The closed point of D, denoted by x0 , defines a reduced effective divisor, and
hence, defines a log structure on D; we denote the resulting log scheme by Dlog , and write
D× := D \ {x0 }. As in the case of the entire X D-log discussed above, we have the definition of
a G-oper on D (resp., Dlog ; resp., D× ). Denote by

(14)
G-Op(D) resp., G-Op(D× )

the set of isomorphism classes of G-opers on D (resp., D× ).
b (which gives
Let E ♠ := (E, ∇, EB ) be a G-oper on Dlog . After choosing a uniformizer t of O

an isomorphism k[[t]] → O) and applying a suitable gauge transformation, ∇ may be expressed
as a log connection on the trivial G-torsor D × G of the form
1
∂t + (p−1 + u) + u(t)
(15)
t
for some u ∈ b, u(t) ∈ b[[t]] (:= b(k[[t]])), where ∂t := dtd . In particular, the monodromy, in
the sense of [15], Definition 1.6.1, of ∇ at x0 (with respect to this expression) is p−1 + u. Here,
let
(16)

c (:= g//G)

denote the GIT quotient of g by the adjoint G-action and let
χ:g→c

(17)

denote the natural quotient. Then, it is verified that the element ρ := χ(p−1 + u) ∈ c(k) is
independent of both the choice of t and the expression (52) of ∇. In this situation, we shall
say that E ♠ is of radius ρ. For each ρ ∈ c(k), we shall write
G-Op(Dlog ; ρ)

(18)

for the set of isomorphism classes of G-opers on Dlog of radius ρ. Then, we can verify the
following assertion, which was already proved in [3], Proposition 2.1.1 (and the discussion at
the end of § 9.1) when the base field is the field complex numbers C. But, since there is a
point that requires special consideration in positive characteristic (i.e., the existence of the
exponential map n → N), we reprove the corresponding assertion here.
Proposition 1.1.
The maps of sets
(19)

G-Op(D) → G-Op(D× ),

G-Op(Dlog ; χ(−ρ̌)) → G-Op(D× )

defined by restriction via the inclusions D× → D and D× ֒→ Dlog respectively are injective.
Moreover, the image of the former map is contained in the image of the latter map and the
resulting injective map
(20)

G-Op(D) ֒→ G-Op(Dlog ; χ(−ρ̌)).

can be given by gauge transformation by ρ̌(t).
Proof. To prove the former assertion, we only consider the injectivity of G-Op(D) → G-Op(D× )
because the proof of the remaining one is entirely similar. Let E1♠ and E2♠ be G-opers on D
b
such that E1♠ ∼
= E2♠ when considered as G-opers on D× . After choosing a uniformizar t of O
and apply a suitable gauge transformation, we can express the connection ∇l (for each l = 1, 2)
defining Ei♠ as
(21)

∇l = ∂t + p−1 + ul (t),

where ul (t) ∈ b[[t]]. By assumption, there exists an element b ∈ B(k((t))) satisfying the
equality ∇2 = (∇1 )b , where (∇1 )b denotes the connection obtained from ∇1 by carrying out
the gauge transformation by b. To complete the proof, it suffices to prove that b ∈ B(k[[t]]).
Suppose, on the contrary, that b ∈
/ B(k[[t]]). Since the respective entries lying in g−1 (⊆ g) of
∇1 and ∇2 are the same (i.e., p−1 ), b turns out to be an element of N(k((t))). Here, recall that
by the assumption (∗)G , we have the exponential map exp : n → N given by [15], § 1.4, (55).
In particular, b = exp(−v(t))−1 for some v(t) ∈ n((t)). It follows from [15], § 1.4, Corollary
1.4.2, that the assumed equality ∇2 = (∇1 )b implies

According to the principal gradation, u1 (t), u2 (t), and v(t) can be decomposed as u1 (t) =

i=1 u2i (t), and v(t) =
i=1 vi (t) respectively, where u1i (t), u2i (t), vi (t)
∈ gi ((t)) (i = 1, · · · , rk(g)). Since b ∈
/ B(k[[t]]) (or equivalently, v(t) ∈
/ n(k[[t]])), the positive
integer imin := min{i ∈ Z>0 | vi (t) ∈
/ gi [[t]]} is well-defined. Given a pair of positive integers
(i, j) with j ≤ i ≤ rk(g), we denote by Fji the degree i graded k-linear endomorphism of g((t))
defined as

By comparing the respective entries lying in gimax −1 (k((t))) of the both sides of (22), we obtain

It follows from the definition of imax that this equality implies [vimax (t), p−1 ] ∈ gimax −1 [[t]]. Moreover, since [−, p−1 ] (= −ad(p−1 )) : gimax → gimax −1 is injective, we have vimax (t) ∈ gimax [[t]].
This is a contradiction, and hence, completes the proof of the former assertion.
The latter assertion follows from the definitions of various maps involved, so we finish the
proof of the proposition.

Remark 1.2.
Since the condition (∗)G holds, it follows from a Chevalley’s theorem (cf. [9], Theorem 1.1.1; [7],

particular, an element λ̌ ∈ t satisfies the equality χ(λ̌) = χ(−ρ̌) if and only if λ̌ = w(−ρ̌) for
some w ∈ W .
r
Also, let X be as before and x := (x
Pi )r i=1 (r ≥ 1) be an ordered collection of distinct closed
points of X. We shall write Dx := i=1 [xi ], where [xi ] (i = 1, · · · , r) denotes the reduced
effective divisor on X determined by xi . For each i ∈ {1, · · · , r}, denote by Dxi the formal
disc in X around xi . Given an element ρ := (ρi )ri=1 of c(k)r , we shall say that a G-oper on
X Dx -log is of radii ρ if, for each i ∈ {1, · · · , r}, the G-oper on Dxi defined as its restriction is
of radius ρi . Denote by

(25)

G-Op(X Dx -log ; ρ )

the subset of G-Op(X Dx -log ) classifying G-opers of radii ρ .
1.3. Generic Miura opers.
Next, let us recall the notion of a (generic) Miura oper on a curve with log structure (cf. [17],
Definition 3.2.1). Let X be a connected proper smooth curve over k and D a reduced effective
divisor on X. A Miura G-oper on X (resp., on X D-log ) is a quadruple Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ),
where (E, ∇, EB ) is a G-oper on X (resp., on X D-log ) and EB′ is another B-reduction of E
horizontal with respect to ∇. Also, for two Miura G-opers Eb1♠ , Eb2♠ , we shall refer to an
isomorphism of G-opers from Eb1♠ to Eb2♠ compatible with the respective second B-reductions as
an isomorphism of Miura G-opers (from Eb1♠ to Eb2♠ ).
Let Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ) be a Miura G-oper on either X or X D-log . By twisting the flag
variety G/B by the B-torsor EB , we obtain a proper scheme (G/B)EB := EB ×B (G/B)
` over X.
Here, denote by w0 the longest element of W . The Bruhat decomposition G = w∈W BwB
gives rise to a decomposition
a
(G/B)EB =
(26)
SEB ,w
w∈W

of (G/B)EB , where each SEB ,w denotes the EB -twist of Bw0 wB, i.e., SEB ,w := EB ×B (Bw0 wB).
Note that the B-reduction EB′ determines a section σEB ,EB′ : X → (G/B)EB of the natural
projection (G/B)EB → X. Given an element w of W and a point x♯ of X, we shall say that
EB and EB′ are in relative position w at x♯ if σEB ,EB′ (x♯ ) belongs to SEB ,w . In particular, if
σEB ,EB′ (x♯ ) belongs to SEB ,1 , then we shall say that EB and EB′ are in generic position at x.
Moreover, we shall say that a Miura G-oper Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ) is generic if EB and EB′ are
in generic position at any point of X. We also have the various notions recalled here in the
case where the entire X or X D-log is replaced by either D, D× , or Dlog .
1.4. Exponent of Miura opers.
Let Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ) be a generic Miura G-oper on Dlog . After choosing a uniformizer
b and applying a gauge transformation, ∇ may be expressed as a log connection on the
t of O
trivial G-torsor D × G of the form

for some λ̌ ∈ t, u(t) ∈ t[[t]] (cf. [17], Proposition 3.4.3, for the case where the underlying curve
is globally defined and in positive characteristic). It is verified that λ̌ is independent of both
the choice of t and the expression (27) of ∇. In this situation, we shall say that Eb♠ is of
exponent λ̌. If a generic Miura G-oper Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ) on Dlog is of exponent λ̌ (∈ t),
then the underlying G-oper (E, ∇, EB ) is of radius χ(p−1 + λ̌) ∈ c(k).
Remark 1.3.
Let λ̌ and w be elements of treg and W respectively. Then, one may verify immediately that
the equality χ(w(λ̌)) = χ(λ̌) = χ(p−1 + λ̌) holds (cf. Remark 1.2). In particular, if Eb♠ is a
generic Miura G-oper on Dlog of exponent λ̌, then the radius of its underlying G-oper coincides
with χ(λ̌).
Remark 1.4.
By applying the gauge transformation by ρ̌ ◦ t ∈ T (k[[t]]), we obtain a bijection from the set of
isomorphism classes of Miura G-opers on D to the set of isomorphism classes of Miura G-opers
on Dlog of exponent −ρ̌. This bijection is compatible (under the equality χ(−ρ̌) = χ(p−1 − ρ̌)
obtained in the above Remark) with the injection (54) via forgetting the data of second Breductions of Miura G-opers.
Next, let x := (xi )ri=1 (r ≥ 1) be an ordered collection of distinct closed points of X, and let
λ := (λ̌i )ri=1 ∈ (treg )r . We shall say that a Miura G-oper Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ) on X Dx -log is of

2. Dormant Miura opers and the Bethe Ansatz equations
In this section, we formulate and prove Theorem A (cf. Theorem 2.5, Propositions 2.8 and
2.9), i.e., the main theorem of the present paper, which may be thought of as an analogues of
the correspondence given in [1] or [2].

2.1. Dormant Miura opers.
In this subsection, we shall show (cf. Proposition 2.2) that each dormant generic Miura oper
λ )triv,+(z;ww ) (cf. (32)) defined in the
specifies a Miura oper classified by the set G-MOp(X Dx -log ; λ̌
previous section.
To begin with, recall from [17], Definition 3.8.1, that a Miura G-oper Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ )
is dormant if ∇ has vanishing p-curvature (cf. e.g., [5], § 5.0, or [17], § 1.6, for the definition
of p-curvature). Then, the following assertion holds.
Proposition 2.1.
Let λ̌ be an element of t such that there exists a dormant generic Miura G-oper Eb♠ :=
(E, ∇, EB , EB′ ) on Dlog of exponent λ̌. Then, λ̌ lies in tFreg .
Proof. Denote by µ ∈ g the monodromy (cf. [15], Definition 1.6.1) of ∇ at the closed point x0 ,
and consider a Jordan decomposition µ = µs +µn with µs semisimple and µn nilpotent. Denote
by ad : g → End(g) the adjoint representation of g, which is injective and compatible with the
respective restricted structures, i.e., p-power operations. One may find an isomorphism α :
∼
End(g) → gldim(g) of restricted Lie algebras which sends α(ad(µ)) (= α(ad(µs )) + α(ad(µn )))
to a Jordan normal form. In particular, α(ad(µs )) is diagonal and every entry of α(ad(µn ))

GAUDIN MODEL MODULO p, TANGO STRUCTURES, AND DORMANT MIURA OPERS

11

except the superdiagonal is 0. Let us observe the following sequence of equalities:
(37)

α(ad(µs )) + α(ad(µn )) = α(ad(µs + µn )) = α(ad((µs + µn )[p] ))
= α(ad(µs + µn ))p = (α(ad(µs )) + α(ad(µn )))p ,

where the second equality follows from the assumption that ∇ has vanishing p-curvature and
(−)[p] denotes the p-power operation on g (cf. [15], § 3.2, Remark 3.2.2). By an explicit computation of (α(ad(µs )) + α(ad(µn )))p , (37) implies that α(ad(µn )) = 0 (hence µn = 0), namely,
µ is conjugate to some v ∈ t. On the other hand, µ is, by definition, conjugate to p−1 + λ̌. It
follows that p−1 + λ̌ is conjugate to v, and hence, λ̌ = w(v) for some w ∈ W . Since p−1 + λ̌, as
well as v, is regular, λ̌ (= w(v)) turns out to be regular. Moreover, by the equality µn = 0, (37)
reads the equality α(ad(µ)) = α(ad(µ))p . This implies the equality v [p] = v, or equivalently,
v ∈ tFreg . This completes the proof of the assertion.

Let X be a connected proper smooth curve over k, x := (xi )ri=1 (r ≥ 1) an ordered collection

Proposition 2.2.

(ii) Suppose further that X = P and λ̌
bijective.
Proof. First, we shall consider assertion (i). Let w ∈ W and Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ) a dormant
b (inducing
generic Miura G-oper on Dlog of exponent w(−ρ̌). Let us choose a uniformizer t of O
∼
b → k[[t]]). To complete the proof, it suffices to prove that (E, ∇, EB ) becomes a Miura GO
oper on D after a gauge transformation by some element of B(k((t))). Here, notice that by
the assumption (∗)G , one may obtain the exponential map exp : n → N given by [15], § 1.4,
(55). By means of this, one may apply an argument similar to the argument in the proof of [3],
Proposition 9.2.1, to our positive characteristic case. Hence, after a gauge transformation by

12

YASUHIRO WAKABAYASHI

some element of B(k((t))), ∇ may be expressed as ∂t + p−1 + v(t) + vt for some v(t) ∈ b[[t]]
and v ∈ n. The mod t reduction of the p-curvature of ∇ is given by v [p] − v, which is equal to
0 because of the dormancy condition on Eb♠ . But, since v ∈ n, we have v [p] = 0, which implies
that v = 0. Therefore, (E, ∇, EB ) forms a G-oper on D, as desired.
Next, we shall consider assertion (ii). Let Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ) be a Miura G-oper classified
by G-MOp(PDx -log ; (−ρ̌)r+1 )triv,+ww , i.e., by G-MOp(PDx -log ; (−ρ̌)r+1 )triv,+(z;ww ) for some z :=
(z1 , · · · , zm ) ∈ C m (x). By applying the discussion in Remark 1.4 to the restriction Eb♠ |Dxi
(for each i = 1, · · · , r + 1), we can verify that Eb♠ comes, via gauge transformation, from a
b♠
Miura G-oper on PDz -log of exponent w . Moreover,
 since the restriction
 of E to Dzj (for
each j ∈ {1, · · · , m − 1}) belongs to G-Op(Dzj ) ⊆ G-Op(Dlog
zj ; χ(−ρ̌)) , this G-oper comes

from a G-oper E0♠ on P. By [16], Corollary 2.6.2 and Theorem 3.3.1, (iv), E0♠ turns out to be
Zzz...
dormant. It follows that Eb♠ is dormant, and hence, belongs to G-MOp(PDx -log ; (−ρ̌)r+1 )gen,+ww .
This completes the proof of assertion (ii).

2.3. Comparison I.
In this subsection, we prove the following Theorem 2.5, being a part of Theorem A. The
corresponding assertion in the complex (i.e., original) case was proved in [1], § 3.2, Theorem
3.2. Also, Lemma 2.6, which is described later and used in the proof of the following theorem,
corresponds to [1], § 2.6, Lemma 2.10. Unlike the proofs in loc. cit., we will not make any
analytic argument in order to conclude our result of positive charactristic.
Theorem 2.5.
Let us keep the notation following Proposition 2.3 and suppose that the equality (46) holds.
Then, the bijection (47) restricts to a bijection

Proof. Since the latter assertion follows directly from the former assertion and Proposition
2.2, (ii), it suffices to prove the former assertion. Let z := (z1 , · · · , zm ) be an element of
C m (x) and denote by Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ) the Miura G-oper corresponding to the unique
λ − ρ̌, α W (−ρ̌))gen . By considering the discussion in the proof

Then, hα, u(0)i = 0 if and only if E belongs to G-Op(D) (cf. (54)).

Proof. To begin with, let us make the following observation. Denote by eα the unique generator
of gα such that {fα , 2α̌, eα } forms an sl2 -triple. Also, denote by exp : n → N the exponential
map given by [15], § 1.4, (55). (We can construct this map because of the assumption (∗)G .)
It follows from [15], § 1.4, Corollary 1.4.2, that after the gauge transformation by exp( 1t · eα )−1 ,
∇ becomes the connection ∇′ of the following from:

transformation by b. By an explicit computation of this gauge transformation, b turns out to
be contained in N(k((t))), i.e., b = exp(−v(t))−1 for some v(t) ∈ n((t)). That is to say, we
have an equality
∇′ = ∂t + p−1 + u(t) −

j = 1, 2, · · · ,) coincides with 1 + j. In particular, the pole order of vrk(g) (t) is 1 + rk(g) − imax .

Remark 2.7.
In [14], A. Varchenko studied the Bethe ansatz equations (for g = sl2 ) modulo p and showed
that the Bethe vector corresponding to its solution is an eigenvector of the Gaudin Hamiltonian.
By this result together with Theorem 2.5, we can construct eigenvectors by means of dormant
generic Miura PGL2 -opers. On the other hand, as explained in § 3.1 later, dormant generic
Miura PGL2 -opers correspond bijectively to (pre-)Tango structures. Thus, we see that a certain
type of (pre-)Tango structures provides eigenvectors of the Gaudin Hamiltonian.

2.4. Comparison II.
In this subsection, we shall characterize, via the bijection (56) obtained in the previous
λ − ρ̌)triv,+ααW consisting of Miura G-opers with
subsection, the subsets of G-MOp(PDx -log ; −λ̌

Proposition 2.3 and suppose that the equality (46) holds.
First, let us consider the case of Miura G-opers vanishing p-curvature, i.e., dormant Miura Gopers. Given an element A of g(k(x)) (= g ⊗k k(x)), we shall define elements A(l) (l = 1, 2, · · · )
of Endk (g(k(x))) determined inductively by the following conditions:
(67)

A(1) := ad(A),

A(l + 1) := ∂x (A(l)) + ad(A) ◦ A(l) (l ≥ 1).

Let ∇ be the connection on the trivial G-torsor over a suitable open subscheme of P \
{∞} (= Spec(k[x])) given by ∇ = ∂x + A. The p-curvature of ∇ may be expressed, by
∼
definition, as A(p) under the trivialization ΩP\{∞} → OP\{∞} given by dx 7→ 1. In particular,
∇ has vanishing p-curvature if and only if A(p) = 0. Now, let us write

Next, we shall consider the case of Miura G-opers with nilpotent p-curvature. Denote by
[0]c the k-rational point of c defined as the image of the zero element of g via χ : g → c. c has a
Gm -action arising from the homotheties on g, and [0]c is invariant under this action. Denote by

Now, let us take a Miura G-oper Eb♠ := (E, ∇, EB , EB′ ). The p-curvature of ∇ can be expressed

Miura G-oper via (56). Denote by B − the opposite Borel subgroup of B relative to T and by

3. Tango structures
In this section, we recall the notion of a Tango structure and consider a bijective correspondence between Tango structures and solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations for g = sl2 . Also,
by means of this correspondence, we construct new examples of Tango structures. In what
follows, we suppose that p ≥ 3.
3.1. Tango structures.
First, we recall the definition of a (pre-)Tango structure and the bijective correspondence
between dormant Miura PGL2 -opers and them.
Let X be a connected proper smooth curve over k of genus gX (≥ 0). Denote by X (1) the
Frobenius twist of X relative to k and by F : X → X (1) the relative Frobenius morphism of
X. Also, denote by BX/k (⊆ ΩX/k ) the sheaf of locally exact 1-forms on X (relative to k). The
direct image F∗ (ΩX/k ) forms a vector bundle on X (1) of rank p. BX/k may be considered, via
the underlying homeomorphism of F , as a subbundle of F∗ (ΩX/k ) of rank p − 1.
Now, let L be a line subbundle of F∗ (BX/k ). Consider the OX (1) -linear composite
(79)

L ֒→ F∗ (BX/k ) ֒→ F∗ (ΩX/k ),

where the first arrow denotes the natural inclusion and the second arrow denotes the morphism
obtained by applying the functor F∗ (−) to the natural inclusion BX/k → ΩX/k . This composite
corresponds to a morphism
(80)

ξL : F ∗ (L) → ΩX/k

via the adjunction relation “F ∗ (−) ⊣ F∗ (−)”.
Definition 3.1.

(i) We shall say that L is a Tango structure on X if ξL is an isomorphism.
(ii) A Tango curve is a connected proper smooth curve over k admitting a Tango structure
on it.

20

YASUHIRO WAKABAYASHI

Remark 3.2.
Let L be a line subbundle of BX/k . Then, one verifies immediately that L is a Tango structure
on X if and only if L has degree 2gXp−2 . In particular, if p ∤ gX − 1, then there is no Tango
structure on X. At the time of writing the present paper, the author did not obtain the
complete list of g’s such that there is a Tango curve of genus g. But, Y. Hoshi recently proved
that there exists a Tango curve of genus g if and only if p | g − 1 (cf. [4], Theorem 1).
Next, we shall recall the definition of a pre-Tango structure in the sense of [17], Definition
5.3.1. Let r be a nonnegative integer and x := (x1 , · · · , xr ) an ordered collection of distinct
closed points of X. (We take x := ∅ if r = 0.) If there is no fear of confusion, we shall
write X log for X Dx -log . The data x induces, via base-change, a collection of closed points
(1)
(1)
x(1) := (x1 , · · · , xr ) in X (1) , which determines a log structure on X (1) ; denote by X (1)log the
resulting log scheme. Moreover, let
(81)

CX log /k : F∗ (ΩX log /k ) → ΩX (1)log /k

be the Cartier operator of X log /k. That is to say, CX log /k is a unique OX (1) -linear morphism
whose composite with the injection ΩX (1)log /k → ΩX (1)log /k ⊗ F∗ (OX ) induced by the natural
injection OX (1) → F∗ (OX ) coincides with the Cartier operator associated with (OX , d) in the
sense of [10], Proposition 1.2.4.
Definition 3.3.
A pre-Tango structure on (X, x) is a Dx -log connection ∇ on ΩX log /k with vanishing pcurvature satisfying that Ker(∇) ⊆ Ker(CX log /k ). (Here, we consider Ker(∇) as an OX (1) submodule of F∗ (ΩX log /k ) via F .)
Remark 3.4.
According to [17], Proposition 5.3.2, the set of pre-Tango structures on (X, ∅) is in bijection
with the set of Tango structures on X.
Indeed, let ∇ be a pre-Tango
 structure on (X, ∅). The OX (1) -module Ker(∇) is contained in
F∗ (BX/k ) = F∗ (Ker(CX/k )) . Since ∇ gives an injection from F∗ (ΩX/k )/Ker(∇) to F∗ (Ω⊗2
X/k )
(which implies that F∗ (ΩX/k )/Ker(∇) is a vector bundle), the quotient F∗ (BX/k )/Ker(∇)
⊆ F∗ (ΩX/k )/Ker(∇) is verified to be a vector bundle. Namely, Ker(∇) specifies a subbundle
of F∗ (BX/k ). Moreover, the condition that ∇ has vanishing p-curvature implies that ξKer(∇) is
an isomorphism. Hence, Ker(∇) specifies a Tango structure.
Conversely, let L be a Tango structure on X. The line bundle F ∗ (L) has uniquely a connection determined by the condition that the sections in F −1 (L) are horizontal. The connection
∇L corresponding, via ξL , to this connection specifies a pre-Tango structure on (X, ∅) (because
of the equality F∗ (BX/k ) = F∗ (Ker(CX/k ))). One verifies that the assignments ∇ 7→ Ker(∇)
and L 7→ ∇L constructed just above give the desired bijective correspondence.
Let us fix an ordered collection l := (l1 , · · · , lr ) ∈ Frp . (We take l := ∅ if r = 0.) Denote by

(82)

Tang(X; x; l )

the set of pre-Tango structures on (X, x) of monodromy l , i.e., whose monodromy at xi (for
each i ∈ {1, · · · , r}) is li .

GAUDIN MODEL MODULO p, TANGO STRUCTURES, AND DORMANT MIURA OPERS

21

Proposition 3.5.
(i) Let m be a positive integer and z := (z1 , · · · , zm ) ∈ C m (x). Then, there exists a
canonical bijection
∼

Tang(X; (x, z); (ll , (−1)m )) → Tang(X; x; l ).

(83)

(ii) There exists a bijective correspondence between the set Tang(X; x; (−1)r ) and the set
of Tango structures on X.
Proof. We shall consider assertion (i). Let us take a pre-Tango structure ∇ classified by
Tang(X; (x, z); (ll , (−1)m )). Denote by ∇−z the D(x,z) -log connection on ΩX Dx -log /k obtained by
restricting ∇ via the inclusion ΩX Dx -log /k ֒→ ΩX D(x,z) -log /k . One verifies that the monodromy
of ∇−z at zj (for each j ∈ {1, · · · , m}) coincides with 0. Hence, ∇−z may be thought of as a
Dx -log connection. Moreover, since the equality
(84)

Ker(CX Dx -log /k ) = Ker(CX D(x,z) -log /k )

holds, ∇−z specifies a pre-Tango structure classified by Tang(X; x; l ).
Conversely, let us take a pre-Tango structure ∇ classified by Tang(X; x; l ); it may be thought
of as a D(x,z) -log connection whose monodromy at zj (for each j ∈ {1, · · · , m}) is 0. Then,
there exists uniquely a D(x,z) -log connection ∇+z on ΩX D(x,z) -log /k whose restriction to ΩX Dx -log /k
coincides with ∇. One verifies (from (84) again) that ∇+z specifies a pre-Tango structure
classified by Tang(X; (x, z); (ll , (−1)m )).
The assignments ∇ 7→ ∇−z and ∇ 7→ ∇+z constructed above give the desired bijective
correspondence. This completes the proof of assertion (i).
Assertion (ii) follows from assertion (i) of the case where m = 0 together with the result
mentioned in Remark 3.4.

At the end of this subsection, we shall recall an important property of Tango structures,
which provide a relationship with dormant generic Miura PGL2 -opers.
Theorem 3.6 (cf. [17], Theorem A).

Let us keep the above notation and suppose that l := (l1 , · · · , lr ) ∈ (F×

3.2. Pull-back via tamely ramified coverings.
In what follows, we shall consider the pull-back of a pre-Tango structure via a tamely ramified
covering. Suppose that we are given a collection of data
(86)

(Y, y, π),

where
• Y denotes another connected proper smooth curve over k;
• y := (y1 , · · · , ys ) (s > 1) denotes an ordered collection of distinct closed points of Y ;

22

YASUHIRO WAKABAYASHI

S
S
• π : Y → X denotes a tamely ramified covering such that π −1 ( ri=1 {xi }) = sj=1 {yj }
Sr
and π is étale away from i=1 {xi }.
Denote by q : {1, · · · , s} → {1, · · · , r} the map of sets determined by π(yj ) = xq(j) (j =
1, · · · , s). For each j ∈ {1, · · · , s}, denote by Rj the ramification index of π at yj (hence
p ∤ Rj ). The morphism π extends to a log étale morphism π log : Y Dy -log → X Dx -log , and hence,
the natural morphism π ∗ (ΩX Dx -log /k ) → ΩY Dy -log /k is an isomorphism.
Now, let ∇ be an element of Tang(X; x; l ). The pull-back of ∇ via π determines, under the
∼
isomorphism π ∗ (ΩX Dx -log /k ) → ΩY Dy -log /k , a Dy -log connection
π ∗ (∇) : ΩY Dy -log /k → Ω⊗2
Y Dy -log /k

(87)

on ΩY Dy -log /k . Here, observe that both the relative Frobenius morphisms and the Cartier
S
S
operators of X \ ri=1 {xi } and Y \ si=1 {yi } are compatible (in the evident sense) via π. This
implies that Ker(π ∗ (∇)) ⊆ Ker(CY Dy -log /k ), and hence, π ∗ (∇) specifies a pre-Tango structure
on (Y, y).
Proposition 3.7.
Write l ′ := (lq(1) R1 , · · · , lq(s) Rs ) ∈ Fsp . Then, the assignment ∇ 7→ π ∗ (∇) discussed above
defines an injection
Tang(X; x; l ) ֒→ Tang(Y ; y; l ′ ).

(88)

Proof. Since the injectivity may be verified immediately, it suffices to prove that the monodromy of the pre-Tango structure π ∗ (∇) at yj (where ∇ ∈ Tang(X; x; l ), j ∈ {1, · · · , s}) is
lq(j) Rj . For simplicity, we write x := xq(j) , y := yj , R := Rj , and l := lq(j) . The formally local
b y := Spec(k[[t1/R ]]) → Spec(k[[t]]) := D
b x (corresponddescription of π at y may be given by D
ing to the natural inclusion k[[t]] ֒→ k[[t1/R ]]), where t is a formal coordinate in X at x. The
b x may be expressed (via a suitable trivialization ΩX Dx -log /k | b ∼
restriction ∇|Db x of ∇ to D

Dx = OD

Example 3.8.
We shall consider the case where X = P. Let l := (l1 , · · · , lr+1 ) (r ≥ 0) be an element of
Fr+1

where a ∈ k , p ∤ n, and (x, y) are an inhomogeneous coordinate of the projective plane P2 .

23

yi for the unique point of Y over xi , i.e., π(yi ) = xi . (The ramification index of π at yi for each
i ∈ {1, · · · , r} is n.) Also, let yr+1, · · · , yr+r′ (r ′ ≥ 1) be the set of points of Y over xr+1 (= ∞).
Write y := (y1 , · · · , yr+r′ ). According to [13], § 6.3, Proposition 6.3.1, the ramification index
of π at yr+i′ (for each i′ ∈ {1, · · · , r ′}) is nd , where d := gcd(n, r). Moreover, the genus of Y is
given by (n−1)(r−1)

Tang(P; x; l ) ֒→ Tang(Y ; y; l ′ ).

In particular, Tang(Y ; y; l ′ ) is nonempty unless Tang(P; x; l ) is empty.

3.3. Examples of Tango structures.
We show that the solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations of a certain type come from
dormant Miura PGL2 -opers.
To this end, we apply the bijective correspondence (57) in thecase ofG = PGL2 and

Now, let us take a positive integer l (and consider the case of m = lp + 1). We combine the
latter assertion of Theorem 2.5, Theorem 3.6, and Proposition 3.5, (i), to obtain the following
composite bijection

In particular, it follows from the discussion in Remark 2.4 that (P, z) admits a pre-Tango
structure of monodromy 1lp+1 if and only if the equality f ′′ (x) = 0 holds, where f (x) :=
Qlp+1

Now, let a, b be positive integers with gcd(a, bp−1) = 1 and h(x) (∈ k[x]) a monic polynomial

(If a > b, then the point at infinity is singular, and hence, we need to replace this plane curve
by its desingularization to obtain a smooth curve.) Since gcd(ap, bp − 1) = gcd(a, bp − 1) = 1,
there is only one point ∞Y at infinity in Y (cf. [13], § 6.3, Proposition 6.3.1). Here, let us take
an ordered collection (z1 , · · · , zapQ
) of elements of k (i.e., closed points in Spec(k[x]) = P \ {∞})
′
satisfying the equality h(x) = ap
i=1 (x − zi ). (The assumption gcd(h(x), h (x)) = 1 implies
′
that zi 6= zi′ if i 6= i .) Denote by π : Y → P the natural projection (x, y) 7→ x, which is
tamely ramified. Also, denote by y := (y1 , · · · , yap+1 ) (where z := (z1 , · · · , zap+1 )) the ordered
collection of distinct points in Y determined uniquely by π(yi ) = zi for any i = 1, · · · , ap + 1,
where zap+1 := ∞. Moreover, denote by ∇ the Dz -log connection on ΩPDz -log /k defined as
(96)

∇ = ∂x +

(under the identification ΩPDz -log /k |P\{∞} → OP\{∞} given by dx 7→ 1). By passing to the
∼
isomorphism π ∗ (ΩPDz -log /k ) → ΩY Dy -log /k induced by π, we obtain a Dy -log connection
(97)

π ∗ (∇) : ΩY Dy -log /k → Ω⊗2
Y Dy -log /k

on ΩY Dy -log /k defined to be the pull-back of ∇. In particular, we obtain an OY (1) -submodule
(98)

Ker(π ∗ (∇))

of F∗ (ΩY Dy -log /k ), where F : Y → Y (1) denotes the relative Frobenius morphism of Y (relative
to k). Then, the following assertion, i.e., Theorem B, holds.
Theorem 3.9.
Suppose that h′′ (x) = 0, or equivalently, (z1 , · · · , zap ) specifies an element of PGL2 -BA0,αap .
Then, Ker(π ∗ (∇)) forms a Tango structure on Y . In particular, Y is a Tango curve.
Proof. Let us fix an element γ ∈ k with h(γ) 6= 0. Consider the automorphism ι of P given
1
by x 7→ x−γ
. Then, ι(z) := (ι(z1 ), · · · , ι(zap+1 ))) are a collection of distinct points in P \
Q
−1
{∞}. Since f (x) := ap+1
· h( x1 + γ) · xap+1 , we see that
i=1 (x − ι(zi )) coincides with h(γ)
gcd(f (x), f ′ (x)) = 1 and f ′′ (x) = 0. It follows from Theorem A that the Dι(z) -log connection
P
1
on ΩPDι(z) -log /k given by ∂x + ap+1
i=1 x−ι(zi ) forms a pre-Tango structure on (P, ι(z)) of monodromy
1ap+1 . By pulling-back via ι, we obtain a pre-Tango structure on (P, z) of monodromy 1ap+1 .
One verifies immediately that it coincides with ∇. Hence, (since bp − 1 = −1 mod p) the pullback π ∗ (∇) forms a pre-Tango structure on (Z, z ) of monodromy (−1)ap+1 (cf. Proposition 3.7).
It follows from Proposition 3.5 (and its proof) that Ker(π ∗ (∇)) specifies a Tango structure, as
desired.

Remark 3.10.
A well-known example of a Tango structures can be found in some paper (cf. e.g., [12],
Example, or [8], Example 1.3). This is constructed as follows. Let l be an integer with lp ≥ 4.
Also, let f (x) be a polynomial of degree l in one variable x and let Y be the plane curve defined
by
(99)

y lp−1 = f (xp ) − x.

One verifies that Y is a smooth curve having only one point ∞ at infinity and ΩY /k =
OY (lp(lp − 3) · ∞). Then, the base-change of the line bundle O(l(lp − 3) · ∞) via the absolute Frobenius morphism of Spec(k) turns out to specify a Tango structure.
Notice that (f (xp ) − x)′ = −1 (which implies that gcd(f (xp ) − x, (f (xp ) − x)′ ) = 1) and
(f (xp ) − x)′′ = 0. Hence, Y is a special case of Tango curves constructed preceding Theorem
3.9. On the other hand, the curve defined, e.g., by the equation y 2p−1 = x2p +xp+1 +axp +bx+c
with c 6= b(a − b) is a Tango curve (by Theorem 3.9), which specifies a new example. Thus,
one can obtain infinitely many new (explicit!) examples of Tango curves.
