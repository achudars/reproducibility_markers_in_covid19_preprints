Abstract – We study transport through a single-level system placed between two reservoirs with
band-structure, taking strong level-reservoir coupling of the order of the energy-scales of these
band-structures. An exact solution in the absence of interactions gives the nonlinear Lamb shift.
As expected, this moves the perfectly-transmitting state (the reservoir state that flows through the
single-level without reflection), and can even turn it into a bound-state. However, here we show
that it can also create additional pairs of perfectly-transmitting states at other energies, when
the coupling exceeds critical values. Then the single-level’s transmission function resembles that
of a multi-level system. Even when the discrete level is outside the reservoirs’ bands, additional
perfectly-transmitting states can appear inside the band when the coupling exceeds a critical
value. We propose observing the bosonic version of this in microwave cavities, and the fermionic
version in the conductance of a quantum dot coupled to 1D or 2D reservoirs.

Introduction.
eplplaineplfirst – There is currently great interest
in strong coupling between small systems and reservoirs
[1–9], for both practical and fundamental reasons. It is
of practical interest in electron nanostructures; for example for lower resistance electronics (resistance being inversely proportional to coupling strength), and more powerful nanoscale thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators [10]. It is of fundamental interest, because it leads to
physics which one could not guess from either the small
system’s properties or the reservoir’s properties. In such
cases, the reservoir can induce long time correlations in
the small system’s evolution, making it non-Markovian,
and thus challenging to model.
In this work, we show that strong coupling has a striking effect on perfectly-transmitting states. These are reservoir states that exhibit perfect (reflectionless) flow from
one reservoir to another through a small system. We
consider the small system to be a single-level system (or
single-mode cavity) as in Figs. 1 & 2. We show that
the perfectly-transmitting states are intimately related
to bound-states, despite having the opposite properties
(bound states carry no steady-state flow between reser-

voirs1 ). Such bound-states are a known (but intriguing)
consequence of strong-coupling to a reservoir with a bandgap, giving non-Markovian dynamics to the single-level
system [12]. Then a particle placed in the single-level system never fully decays into the continuum even when it
has the energy to do so [13–19]. Bound-states were first
predicted for an impurity in a superconductor [20], or an
electronic tight-binding model [21]. They were studied
for the Wigner-Weisskopf model of an atomic level coupled to a photonic vacuum with band-structure [13–16],
reviewed in Refs. [17, 18], with generalizations to a finitetemperature Fano-Anderson model [12, 19, 22–24]. Their
properties were explored in models of quantum dots coupled to electronic reservoirs [11, 12, 19, 25–32]. Recent experiments probed them in NV centres in a waveguide [33],
and for matter waves in ultracold atoms [34]. While such
bound-states have rich physics, we show that the physics
of perfectly-transmitting states is similar, but richer.
Our main result is that additional perfectlytransmitting states appear via transitions that occur
when the coupling exceeds critical values.
Then a
single-level’s transmission function resembles that of a
multi-level system. The most striking example is when
the level’s energy is outside the reservoirs’ band. Once
the coupling exceeds a critical value, additional perfectlytransmitting states appear within the band, ensuring
perfect (reflectionless) flow between the reservoirs, even
though the flow is through a level at an energy outside
the band.
Perfectly-transmitting states in golden-rule. –
At weak-coupling, the perfectly-transmitting state of
a single-level system is described by Fermi’s golden rule
[35]. For extremely weak coupling, resonant transmission
happens at the energy of this level, so there is a perfectlytransmitting state at this energy. The golden rule then
implies that as the coupling increases, this state is broadened and Lamb shifted. However, this argument does
not predict more than one perfectly-transmitting state per
discrete-level, unlike our exact calculation.
If the single-level has an energy outside the reservoir’s
band, then this golden-rule argument would predict that
the level is Lamb shifted away from the band (levelrepulsion between the level and the reservoir modes), while
it broadens into a Lorentzian. This would suggest that
transmission between reservoirs only occurs through the
Lorentzian’s tail (see Fig. 1b). Hence, this golden-rule argument cannot explain the perfectly-transmitting states
that appear in our exact calculation, see Fig. 3.
This golden-rule argument fails due to its neglect of the
energy dependence of the Lamb shift, induced by the reservoirs’ band-structure. It is the nonlinearity of this energy

Fig. 2: (a) A microwave system in which the single-level is
the single-mode of disc d, while each reservoir is a chain of
single-mode dielectric discs (yellow), with weak coupling to the
nearest neighbour in the chain (indicated by pink bands). Disc
d’s single-mode is at an energy which differs by ωd from those
in the reservoir chains, and it couples to the nth disc in each
reservoir (the sketch shows n = 3) with coupling strength K.

perfectly-transmitting states appear.

Hamiltonian and transmission function. – We
consider the Fano-Anderson model [21,36–38] for a singlelevel system coupled to two reservoirs; left (L) and right
(R). This model applies to electrons (Fig. 1) in the absence of spin and interaction effects2 , or with interactions
treated in the Hartree approximation [37]. It also ap1 We consider the dc (zero-frequency) component of the current,

established at long times after turning on the coupling. This clarification is important because bound-states can induce finite-frequency
oscillations which survive in the long-time limit, if the coupling is
turned on non-adiabatically [9, 11].

2 The model applies to quantum dots with on-site Coulomb interactions, so long as the magnetic field is strong enough that the
spin-state with higher energy is always empty.

The solutions with ωs that fall in band-gaps (so JL (ω) =
JR (ω) = 0) are well known to be bound-states [21, 38, 48].
Here we see all other solutions are perfectly-transmitting
states, because they have T (ω) = 1 from Eq. (4) with
JL (ω) = JR (ω) 6= 0. All such solutions can be found
graphically by plotting Λ(ω), and seeing where it intersects
the line (ω − ωd ).
For any Jα (ω), Eq. (5) shows that Λ(ω) decreases monotonically with ω in any band gap, so there is at most one
bound state in any given band-gap [9]. In contrast, Λ(ω)
can be non-monotonic inside bands, see Figs. 2b and 5a for
examples. Then there can be multiple solutions of Eq. (7)
inside a band, meaning multiple perfectly-transmitting
states in that band. At strong coupling, their number
equals the number of zeros of Λ(ω) inside that band. Often this is the maximum number of perfectly transmitting
states, however there are models with more such states at
weak or intermediate coupling (see Appendix C).
We concentrate on JL (ω) = JR (ω) in this work. However, we note that there are no perfectly-transmitting
states for JL (ω) 6= JR (ω). Instead, solutions of Eq. (7) correspond to the
transmission, Tmax (ω) =
.maximum allowed
2
4JL (ω)JR (ω) JL (ω) + JR (ω) ; that is to say that no
choice of ωd that will give a larger T (ω) at this ω.
Phase-diagrams. – By counting the solutions of the
Eq. (7), we can construct “phase diagrams” of the number of perfectly-transmitting states and bound states as
a function of the discrete level’s energy, ωd , and the dotreservoir coupling, Kα , as in Figs. 4 and 5c. Since Λ(ω)
is a continuous function of ω, new solutions of Eq. (7) appear in pairs. At the same time all the solutions move with
coupling. Hence, there are two main types of transitions.
Transitions of type (i) are where a perfectly-transmitting
state moves out of the continuum to become a bound state,
as discussed in Ref. [9]. Transitions of type (ii) are those
where an additional pair of perfectly-transmitting states is
added. In this case, as the coupling approaches the phase
boundary, a peak grows to form a perfectly-transmitting
state at the phase boundary, which splits into two such
states upon passing into the new phase.
There is also a non-generic transition, which we call
type (iii), in which types (i) and (ii) occur together; i.e. a
pair of states appear at the band edge, but one immediately moves out of the band to become a bound-state while
the other moves into the band as a perfectly-transmitting
state. It is non-generic because it only happens when
Λ(ω) has a cusp at the band-edge, and its first and second
derivative have the same sign on the band side of the cusp.
However, this is the case for all the models in Fig. 2b, so
type (iii) transitions occur there.

states and l is the number of bound-states.

Perfect transmission with level outside band. –
If ωd is not within a band, then there are no perfectlytransmitting states at weak-coupling (assuming Jα (ω) and
Λ(ω) do not diverge). However, as the coupling is increased, transitions of type (ii) or (iii) can occur which
generate one or more perfectly-transmitting states inside
the band. Transitions from white to yellow in Fig. 4 are
type (ii), while those from white to grey are type (iii).
In addition, for JL (ω) = JR (ω) there are perfectlytransmitting states at any ω for which JL (ω) diverges, if it
diverges faster than Λ(ω). Then Eq. (4) gives T (ω) = 1 at
this ω for all ωd and all Kα , even Kα → 0 [9]; see e.g. T (ω)
(n→∞)
at the band-edge for n → ∞ in Fig. 3, due to Jα
(ω)
having a square-root divergence there.
Microwave tight-binding reservoirs. – We imagine microwave experiments on tight-binding Hamiltonians
like in Refs. [49–51], with high-refractive index dielectric
discs arranged as in Fig. 2a, and sandwiched between two
metallic plates. Each centimetre-sized disc supports a single GigaHertz mode, whose energy is tuned by changing
the disc size. The discs couple to each other via evanescent
waves in the air between the metallic plates, so the tunnel
coupling can be tuned by changing the distance between
discs. The two one-dimensional chains of identical discs
play the role of the reservoirs, and they are both coupled
to a different-sized disc (disc d), whose resonance is detuned from the others by an energy ωd , as in Ref. [52],
but with two reservoirs instead of one. We calculate the
transmission from one chain to the other, T (ω), to find
the perfectly-transmitting states.

Multiple perfectly-transmitting states of a single-level at strong coupling
We define ω = E − E0 , where E is the injected microwave’s energy, and E0 is the energy of the middle of
the reservoir’s band (given by the energy of the mode of a
reservoir disc in isolation). Then if disc d couples to disc
n in reservoir α ∈ {L, R}, the reservoir’s spectral function
is proportional to the local density-of-states at disc n in
the reservoir [53]. As shown in Fig. 2b, these are [52]

The transmission function, T (ω), is then given by
Eq. (4). For all n < ∞, if the energy of disk d is outside
the band (|ωd | > ωc ), then the transmission at all ω is
very small at weak-coupling, see the grey curves in Fig. 3.
It is surprising to find that once the coupling exceeds a
critical value, then T (ω) = 1 at certain values of ω inside
the band (marked by inverted black triangles in Fig. 3).
This means that microwaves injected into reservoir L at
these energies will be perfectly transmitted into reservoir
R (without any reflection), despite passing through disk d
whose energy is not even within the band.
Fig. 4 shows the phase diagram of perfectlytransmitting states for various n. At strong coupling,
there are (2n−1) such states (in addition to two boundstates outside the band) whether disc d’s energy is in the
band or not, because Eq. (9) has (2n−1) zeros in the band.
As the coupling grows, every alternate perfectly transmitting state broadens to a width of the order of the distance between peaks, however the other peaks move towards energies where Jα (ω) vanishes, and so become extremely sharp. If one fine-tunes the dot energy ωd one can
align one of these states exactly at an energy where Jα (ω)
vanishes, at which point it becomes a “bound state in the
continuum” [54] of the type discussed in Ref. [52]. However, the perfectly-transmitting states are always present
and do not require any such fine-tuning.
For n → ∞, the peaks become so densely packed that
(n→∞)
the transmission becomes smooth, and Jα
(ω) has a
square-root divergence at ω = ±ωc . Then there are perfectly transmitting states at the band-edges [9] at all K.

peak was seen at the zigzag edge of a hexagonal lattice of
microwave cavities [50]. This peak is specific to the edge;
the bulk’s density of states is very different, and vanishes
at the Dirac point (ω = 0 in Fig. 5). At sub-Kelvin temperatures, the dot’s spin-splitting at 4 Tesla will be much
bigger than temperature, so we can take a single-level dot
whose upper spin-state is empty at all times, making the
dot well modelled by Eq. (1). The STMpmeasurement
gives us Jα (ω) for |ω| < 2ε0 where ε0 = 2eh̄vF2 B [55].
We extrapolate
this

 phenomenologically to |ω| > 2ε0 as
α|ω| exp − |ω|/ωc with ωc = 10ε0 and α matching the
gradient at ω = ±2ε0 . Numerically integrating over this
Jα (ω), gives the Λα (ω) in Fig. 5a, and the dot’s transmission in Fig. 5b, to be observed experimentally with
conductance measurements, see Eq. (6).
For small K, there is one perfectly-transmitting state
on-resonance (at the energy of the dot, ωd ). However as
K is increased, there is a transition to three such states.
The phase diagram in Fig. 5c shows up to seven such states
for large coupling K. However, the physics at large K depends on Jα (ω) at large |ω|, and so depends on our chosen
extrapolation beyond the experimental data at |ω| > 2ε0 .
As such, the cross-hatched region of Fig. 5c may not agree
with the experiments.
Comparison with local density-of-states. –
When JR (ω) = JL (ω),
 the local density-of-states of
the discrete-level is T (ω) 2π 2 JL (ω) . Hence we see that
the peaks of the local density-of-states will not coincide
with the perfectly-transmitting states, unless 1/JL (ω) has
a very weak ω dependence at the ω in question. In particular, when Jα (ω) has a square-root divergence (such as
for n → ∞ in Eq. (8) or at the edge of the superconducting gap), the local density-of-states of the discrete-level
vanishes, even though there is a perfectly-transmitting

state there. Conversely, the factor of 1 JL (ω) in the local density-of-states means that it could have a peak at a
value of ω which does not satisfy Eq. (7), if JL (ω)’s gradient is large at this ω. Ref. [38] used Eq. (7) as a heuristic method of finding peaks in the local density-of-states.
The examples here show that this method is imprecise for
such peaks (particularly at large K), when it is exact for
perfectly-transmitting states at all K.

transmitting states at these energies.
Replacing finite-width peaks in Jα (ω) with δ-peaks gets
some features right for coupling much greater than the
peak width, K  Ω. It correctly gives the solutions of
Eq. (7) at ω  ωc for K/ωc → ∞. It also correctly predicts that one solution will be at the centre of the spectral
function’s peak (i.e. at ω = ω1 ) for K  ωc , ωd .
This approximation can be improved by taking
Lorentzians in place of δ functions. Indeed, this is a reasonable approximation for the peak in
 the experimental

Jα (ω) in Fig. 5. Then Jα (ω) = Kα Ω2 (ω − ω1 )2 + Ω2 ,
so Eq. (5) gives the Lamb shift [2, 44]
Λα (ω) =

π Kα Ω (ω − ω1 )
.
(ω − ω1 )2 + Ω2

(10)

Its qualitative features are a negative dip at (ω − ω1 ) ∼
−Ω, growth through zero at ω ∼ ω1 and a positive peak
at (ω − ω1 ) ∼ Ω. These qualitative features are the same
for other-shaped peaks in Jα (ω), such as in Fig. 2b.
A more sophisticated approach in the same spirit is the
“reaction coordinate mapping” [56, 57], recently used [44]
on models like our Eq. (1). Unfortunately, this mapping
did not simplify the calculations presented in this work.
Conclusions. – We show that a discrete-level
strongly coupled to two reservoirs can exhibit multiple
perfectly-transmitting states, as if it were a multi-level
system. Even when the discrete-level is at an energy outside the reservoirs’ bands, such states can appear when
the coupling exceed a critical value, allowing perfect (reflectionless) flow between the two reservoirs. We propose
observing this in electronic and microwave systems.
This model is a good testing ground for quantum thermodynamics at strong coupling [6,8,58–61], since the nonMarkovian dynamics has such clear physical consequences
for both bound states and perfectly-transmitting states.
Some of the consequences for thermoelectric effects have
been studied [9], but they merit further consideration.

Λα (ω) for the nth site in a one dimensional chain are
given in compact forms by Eq. (8,9), where we recall that
y ≡ ω/ωc . However, these are not the most transparent
forms for energies inside the band, |y| ≤ 1. There one can
use the fact cos ϕy = y with the multiple angle formulas
in trigonometry to write the expressions in terms of polynomials in y. Then the spectral functions inside the band

We see that this is y times an (n − 1)-degree polynomial

Multiple perfectly-transmitting states of a single-level at strong coupling

intersect Λ(ω) up to three times inside the band (i.e. up
to three perfectly-transmitting states). There are always
three perfectly-transmitting states at weak-coupling, but
only one perfectly-transmitting state above a certain critical coupling. The transition from three to one perfectlytransmitting states occurs when two such states converge
and annihilate (a transition of type ii).
The fact that there are five solutions of Eq. (7) (two
bound-states and three perfectly-transmitting states) at
arbitrarily small coupling is a drastic indication that the
golden-rule (which never predicts more than one such solution) fails even at vanishing coupling. A similar failure
was already noted when there is a square-root divergence
at the band-edge [9], because J(ω) exhibits a divergence.
Now we can see that such a failure of golden-rule can also
occur when Λ(ω) exhibit a divergence (even if J(ω) is convergent).
If there is no divergence in J(ω) or Λ(ω), then the golden
rule will work at small coupling, and there will only be
a single solution of Eq. (7) in the weak-coupling limit,
K → 0. This solution’s energy will be extremely close to
ωd , so it will correspond to a bound-state if ωd is outside
the band, and a perfectly-transmitting state if ωd is inside the band. However, in this case, it is not difficult to
find examples in which the maximum number of perfectlytransmitting states occurs at intermediate coupling. Imagine taking almost any case where Λ(ω) does not diverge
and is not a straight line inside the band, such as s = 1 or
s = 1/4 in Fig. 6, or indeed taking any −1/2 < s ≤ 0 with
added rounding at the band-edge so divergences in J(ω)
or Λ(ω) are replaced by large peaks. Then it is easy to
find situations with ωd close to the band centre in which
there is;
• one perfectly-transmitting state with no bound states
at small coupling,
• three perfectly-transmitting states and two bound
states at intermediate coupling,
• one perfectly-transmitting state and two bound states
at large coupling.
So there are more such states at intermediate levelreservoir coupling than at large or small coupling.
