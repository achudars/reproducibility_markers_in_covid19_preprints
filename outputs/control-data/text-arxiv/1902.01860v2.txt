ABSTRACT

The evolution of molecular clouds in galactic centres is thought to differ from that in galactic
discs due to a significant influence of the external gravitational potential. We present a set
of numerical simulations of molecular clouds orbiting on the 100-pc stream of the Central
Molecular Zone (the central ∼ 500 pc of the Galaxy) and characterise their morphological
and kinematic evolution in response to the background potential and eccentric orbital motion.
We find that the clouds are shaped by strong shear and torques, by tidal and geometric deformation, and by their passage through the orbital pericentre. Within our simulations, these
mechanisms control cloud sizes, aspect ratios, position angles, filamentary structure, column
densities, velocity dispersions, line-of-sight velocity gradients, spin angular momenta, and
kinematic complexity. By comparing these predictions to observations of clouds on the Galactic Centre ‘dust ridge’, we find that our simulations naturally reproduce a broad range of key
observed morphological and kinematic features, which can be explained in terms of wellunderstood physical mechanisms. We argue that the accretion of gas clouds onto the central
regions of galaxies, where the rotation curve turns over and the tidal field is fully compressive, is accompanied by transformative dynamical changes to the clouds, leading to collapse
and star formation. This can generate an evolutionary progression of cloud collapse with a
common starting point, which either marks the time of accretion onto the tidally-compressive
region or of the most recent pericentre passage. Together, these processes may naturally produce the synchronised starbursts observed in numerous (extra)galactic nuclei.

INTRODUCTION

The evolution of molecular clouds and their ability to form stars
is a fundamental process in astrophysics, shaping the stellar populations and galaxies that populate the Universe. Over the past
decades, star formation within molecular clouds has been studied
in extensive detail in the solar neighbourhood, the Galactic disc,
and the Magellanic Clouds (see e.g. Kennicutt & Evans 2012 for a
?

review). However, when considered in a cosmological context, this
range of environments is extremely limited and unrepresentative of
the conditions under which most stars in the Universe formed. For
instance, the gas densities, pressures, and velocity dispersions in
these local-Universe environments (e.g. Heyer & Dame 2015) are
factors-of-several to orders of magnitude lower than at the time of
the peak cosmic star formation history (e.g. Swinbank et al. 2012).
Thanks to major Galactic plane surveys across a wide wavelength range (e.g. Oka et al. 1998; Schuller et al. 2009, 2017; Molinari et al. 2010; Bally et al. 2010; Aguirre et al. 2011; Walsh et al.

J. M. D. Kruijssen et al.

2011; Purcell et al. 2012; Jones et al. 2012; Ginsburg et al. 2013;
Jackson et al. 2013; Krieger et al. 2017; Longmore et al. 2017), as
well as the arrival of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA), it is now possible to study cloud evolution and star
formation near the Galactic Centre, i.e. in the Central Molecular
Zone (CMZ, the central ∼ 500 pc) of the Milky Way. This represents a major extension of the conditions probed traditionally and
is crucial for a fundamental understanding of cloud evolution and
star formation for the following reasons.
(i) The gas densities (e.g. Bally et al. 1987; Rathborne et al.
2015), pressures (e.g. Oka et al. 2001; Rathborne et al. 2014b), temperatures (e.g. Huettemeister et al. 1993; Ao et al. 2013; Mills &
Morris 2013; Ginsburg et al. 2016; Krieger et al. 2017), and velocity dispersions (e.g. Shetty et al. 2012; Henshaw et al. 2016a;
Kauffmann et al. 2017a) of CMZ clouds are similar to those in
high-redshift galaxies at the time of the peak cosmic star formation rate (Kruijssen & Longmore 2013). Insights drawn from star
formation within CMZ clouds are thus likely to be more representative for how most stars in the Universe formed than those from
solar neighbourhood studies.
(ii) The evolution of CMZ clouds and their ability to form stars
has been suggested to be closely coupled to galactic (and orbital)
dynamics and strong shearing motions (Longmore et al. 2013b;
Kruijssen et al. 2014; Krumholz & Kruijssen 2015; Federrath et al.
2016; Meidt et al. 2019). This close relation may give rise to
episodic star formation (e.g. Krumholz et al. 2017) and places the
current CMZ near a star formation minimum, plausibly explaining why the CMZ has an unusually low star formation efficiency
(Longmore et al. 2013a; Barnes et al. 2017, also see Guesten &
Downes 1983; Taylor et al. 1993; Kauffmann et al. 2013, 2017a;
Lu et al. 2019). A similar underproduction of stars per unit ‘dense’
(ρ & 104 cm−3 ) gas has recently been found in extragalactic centres (Usero et al. 2015; Bigiel et al. 2016; Gallagher et al. 2018),
implying that the results found for the Galactic CMZ also extend
to other galaxies. The relation between star formation activity and
galactic dynamics may play an important role in setting the bottlenecks (or avenues) towards feeding supermassive black holes in
galactic nuclei (e.g. Kruijssen 2017) and may apply more generally
to galactic discs (e.g. Meidt et al. 2018). The highly dynamical environment of the CMZ provides the best opportunity for characterising the pertinent physics, especially thanks to its close proximity.
(iii) A subset of the CMZ clouds, i.e. the ‘dust ridge’ (Lis et al.
1994, also see Section 2.2), may follow an absolute evolutionary time sequence, potentially providing the unique opportunity of
studying cloud evolution, star formation, and feedback as a function
of absolute time (e.g. Longmore et al. 2013b). A variety of recent
papers have shown that the gas in the inner CMZ (R < 120 pc) is
situated on a stream that follows an eccentric orbit (Molinari et al.
2011; Kruijssen et al. 2015; Henshaw et al. 2016a) and marks the
transition from highly supervirial gas at larger radii to nearly virialised gas on the stream (e.g. Kruijssen et al. 2014; Walker et al.
2015; Henshaw et al. 2016b; Kauffmann et al. 2017b). Similar
structures are found in extragalactic observations (e.g. Peeples &
Martini 2006) and numerical simulations of galactic centres (Emsellem et al. 2015; Sormani et al. 2018). The tidal field at the
radii spanned by this ‘100-pc stream’ is fully compressive due to
the steep slope of the enclosed mass distribution (Kruijssen et al.
2015).1 The strength of this tidal compression peaks when clouds
1

Appendix A of Kruijssen et al. (2015) shows that the enclosed stellar
mass Mencl ∝ r2.2 for the galactocentric radii of interest, yielding a radial

pass through pericentre, which has led to the suggestion that the
pericentre passage may nudge the clouds into gravitational collapse
as they condense out of the supervirial, diffuse medium (Longmore
et al. 2013b; Rathborne et al. 2014a; Kruijssen et al. 2015). This
idea is supported by observations showing trends of increasing gas
temperatures (Ginsburg et al. 2016; Krieger et al. 2017) and possibly star formation activity (Immer et al. 2012; Schmiedeke et al.
2016; Barnes et al. 2017; Walker et al. 2018; Ginsburg et al. 2018)
after pericentre passage, as well as by theoretical results showing
that epicyclic perturbations (i.e. pericentre passages) may influence
cloud evolution in the CMZ prior to gravitational free-fall taking
over (Jeffreson et al. 2018). If true, these results have the major implication that the position along the 100-pc stream is an indicator of
evolutionary age. However, such evolutionary sequences along the
100-pc stream are not always monotonic (Kauffmann et al. 2017b),
prompting the question whether deviations from monotonicity may
reflect differences in initial conditions (Kruijssen 2017), or if other
events may induce cloud collapse and subsequent star formation.
In this paper, we present hydrodynamical simulations of gas
clouds on the best-fitting orbit of the 100-pc stream from Kruijssen
et al. (2015). There exists a rich literature on simulations of isolated
clouds, but studies on the evolution of single clouds in external potentials are limited in number. We discuss in detail how the gravitational potential and the pericentre passage affect the morphology
and kinematics of the simulated clouds and compare the results to
observed CMZ clouds. This way, we characterise the interplay between orbital dynamics and cloud evolution in the CMZ and find
that the arrival of gas onto the 100-pc stream and its subsequent
pericentre passage mark a transformational event that reproduces
several key features of observed CMZ clouds. In a companion paper (Dale et al. 2019), we present the simulations in detail, discuss
the general properties of clouds orbiting in external potentials relative to several control experiments, and investigate how the external
potential affects the star formation activity of the orbiting clouds.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF GAS CLOUDS ON
AN ECCENTRIC ORBIT IN THE CMZ POTENTIAL
Summary of the numerical model

We carry out simulations of massive gas clouds in the CMZ environment (Dale et al. 2019) using the state-of-the-art smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GANDALF (Hubber et al. 2018).
The simulations considered here include self-gravity using an octal
tree, as well as hydrodynamics and artificial viscosity (Monaghan
1997), with the gas following a barytropic equation of state with
a critical density of 2.5 × 107 cm−3 (assuming a mean molecular weight per particle of µp = 2.35). Gas above a density of
2.5 × 106 cm−3 is converted into sink particles, implying that the
effective equation of state is isothermal, with an adopted temperature of T = 65 K to represent the high temperature of CMZ gas
(e.g. Ao et al. 2013; Ginsburg et al. 2016; Krieger et al. 2017). At
the adopted numerical resolution (see below), these sink particles
do not represent individual stars, but stellar subclusters. We assign
no further physical meaning to these particles, because we are interested in following the large-scale morphology and kinematics

tidal force of Trr = −∂/∂r(GMencl /r2 ) = −0.2GMencl /r3 < 0. The
azimuthal and vertical tidal forces are more compressive by definition in
axisymmetric potentials.

of the clouds. The sink particles are only included to prevent the
simulations from reaching excessively high (and computationally
costly) densities.
The presented simulations do not include stellar feedback
or magnetic fields, because we aim to study the pure gravohydrodynamics of gas clouds on an eccentric orbit around the
Galactic Centre. These mechanisms would act to slow down or
truncate star formation. As a result, the simulated clouds will always collapse to form stars at an efficiency much higher than observed or obtained by simulations that do include feedback and/or
magnetic fields. While the present paper does not report on any of
the star formation characteristics of the simulations, we quantify
the relative influence of orbital dynamics on the star formation efficiency in Dale et al. (2019).
The full suite of simulations presented in Dale et al. (2019)
contains 36 models of 106 SPH particles each, consisting of 12
different sets of initial conditions followed in three different tidal
environments. Here we consider a total of 5 different simulations
that represent the subset of ‘tidally-virialised’ clouds from Dale
et al. (2019, also see below) and are moving on the Kruijssen et al.
(2015) orbit in the gravitational potential generated by the mass
distribution from Launhardt et al. (2002), with a vertical flattening parameter qΦ = 0.63 (see Appendix A of Kruijssen et al.
2015). For comparison, we also consider five ‘control runs’, in
which the clouds are moving on a circular orbit in the same background potential. These simulations follow the evolution of spherical clouds with a Gaussian initial density profile, which we truncate at the radius Rt , where the local volume density has dropped
to 5 per cent of the central value (corresponding to 2.45 standard
deviations or 1.70 times the half-mass radius Rh of the truncated
Gaussian). The clouds have a divergence-free initial turbulent velocity field, i.e. without any net compression or expansion. We have
carried out several random realisations of the velocity field and
select the one with a net angular velocity opposite to the orbital
motion of 1 Myr−1 . This way, the spin angular momentum and
angular velocity are roughly consistent with what a cloud would
have if it were given an infinitesimal perturbation to induce its contraction towards its centre of mass within the shearing interstellar
medium in the CMZ potential (cf. its shear-driven angular velocity
of rdΩ/dr ≈ −0.7 Myr−1 , caused by the fact that the circular
velocity increases sub-linearly with galactocentric radius). This is
also consistent with the regular spacing of clouds observed on the
100-pc stream (Henshaw et al. 2016b).
The global properties of the clouds are uniquely set by the
mean volume density ρ, virial parameter αvir ≡ 2T /|V | (with
T the kinetic energy and V the gravitational potential energy),2
2

For this definition, virial equilibrium is achieved at αvir = 1.

and velocity dispersion σ, implying that the masses and radii vary.
We first generate clouds with ρ = {0.4, 1.3, 3.8} × 103 cm−3 ,
αvir = {0.87, 2.6, 7.8}, and σ = {6.3, 12.7, 19.0} km s−1 ,
with the intermediate values representing the fiducial model (these
choices are justified below). Relative to the fiducial model, we obtain six non-fiducial models by changing one parameter at a time.
All non-fiducial models are derived from the fiducial model by scaling the particle masses, as well as their position and velocity vectors, such that the resulting set of initial conditions is homologous.
We then isotropically adjust the velocity dispersions such that the
internal turbulent energy balances the compressive tidal energy due
to the background potential. Without such a ‘tidal virialisation’ (as
in the ‘self-virialised’ models of Dale et al. 2019) by elevating the
turbulent velocity dispersion and the corresponding virial ratio, the
clouds undergo rapid gravitational collapse. This tidal virialisation
fixes the virial parameter, because it becomes inversely related to
the cloud density, thus leaving us with five models in total. The
resulting initial velocity dispersions and virial parameters of the
clouds span σ = 12.1–41.2 km s−1 and αvir = 3.1–27.4. All
parameters describing the initial conditions are summarised in Table 1.
The initial column and volume densities are chosen to be similar to those observed in the CMZ upstream of the dust ridge (at
−0.◦ 7 < l < 0.◦ 0 and −0.◦ 1 < b < 0.◦ 1), which are thought
to have recently condensed out of the diffuse medium (Henshaw
et al. 2016b), spanning Σ = 0.5–1.5 × 103 M pc−2 and ρ = 2–
7 × 103 cm−3 , respectively (Henshaw et al. 2017). While these
densities are already similar to those used in our initial conditions,
it is important to note that these observations probe projected radii
smaller by a factor of ∼ 7. Using the observed size-linewidth relation σ ∝ R0.7 (e.g. Shetty et al. 2012; Kauffmann et al. 2017a) and
assuming virial equilibrium (M ∝ Rσ 2 ), we expect that Σ ∝ R0.4
and ρ ∝ R−0.6 . Extrapolating the densities of all clouds from Henshaw et al. (2017) to the spatial scales of the simulated clouds, we
obtain Σ = 0.8–3.3×103 M pc−2 and ρ = 0.6–3.2×103 cm−3 ,
in excellent agreement with Table 1. Similarly, the velocity dispersions are consistent with the observed size-linewidth relation
(e.g. Shetty et al. 2012; Kruijssen & Longmore 2013; Kauffmann
et al. 2017a), which at the radii listed in Table 1 require σ = 5–
40 km s−1 . Again, this matches the range spanned by our set of
initial conditions, indicating that the simulations capture the full
range of physical conditions observed upstream of the dust ridge.
We deliberately model clouds with masses higher than those

of most of the observed CMZ clouds, so that we can model the condensation of such clouds out of a more extended gas reservoir (cf.
Henshaw et al. 2016b). We initialise the clouds shortly after the
apocentre passage preceding the dust ridge in the Kruijssen et al.
(2015) model, at coordinates {l, b} = {−0.◦ 65, −0.◦ 07} and a radius of r0 = 90 pc (corresponding to t0 = −2.46 Myr in Appendix C of Kruijssen et al. 2015). Each simulation then follows a
single cloud through pericentre, across the dust ridge, past the position of Sgr B2. This way, the simulations capture the evolution
of the clouds across a complete radial orbital oscillation, from their
diffuse state near apocentre through the dynamical perturbations
induced by their orbit in the gravitational potential. Throughout the
paper, we use a non-rotating coordinate system centred on the origin of the Galactic coordinate system, i.e. on {l, b} = {0.◦ 0, 0.◦ 0},
with the x-axis pointing towards negative Galactic longitudes, the
y-axis pointing from the observer to the Galactic centre (with
Sgr A∗ at y = 0), and the z-axis pointing towards positive Galactic
latitudes.
2.2

Column density maps

In order to perform a first, visual comparison of the simulated
clouds to the observed CMZ clouds on the dust ridge, we combine a number of snapshots from the different simulations, taken
at different times to match the positions of the observed clouds,
and generate column density maps of the gas with densities ρ >
104 cm−3 . This density threshold is chosen to suppress the (initially) extended cloud envelopes in the simulations and represent
the high-density gas found in the CMZ, as traced by the bulk of the
dust emission (e.g. Longmore et al. 2013a) and molecules such as
HCN and NH3 (e.g. Mills & Morris 2013; Rathborne et al. 2014a;
Krieger et al. 2017). We consider three projections of the simulation
snapshots, i.e. top-down {l, y}, plane-of-sky {l, b}, and positionvelocity {l, vlos }.3
The snapshots are selected to visually best represent the real
3 Throughout this paper, we adopt a distance to the Galactic Centre of d =
8.3 kpc (Reid et al. 2014) when converting between angular and physical
sizes, for which {1◦ , 10 , 100 } ≈ {145, 2.41, 0.040} pc.

CMZ clouds in the {l, b} plane in terms of their spatial extents,
column densities, and orientations. This is a necessary step, because there are no constraints on the initial conditions of the clouds.
The relevant question to ask is thus whether any of them reproduce
the {l, b, vlos } structure of the observed dust ridge clouds. Even
though this optimises the agreement between simulations and observations, it is an interesting comparison to make, because the initial conditions of the simulations span the full range of physical
conditions seen in the progenitors of the dust ridge clouds. As we
will see below, the simulated evolution of this variety of progenitors reproduces the observed variety of dust ridge clouds, which is
an important test of the model’s self-consistency. This enables the
interpretation of several key observables in terms of the underlying physical processes. In doing so, we caution that this interpretation should be carried out in terms of global characteristics or systematic trends only. Direct comparisons between any observed and
simulated cloud should be made with caution, as the detailed structure (e.g. individual filamentary structures and positions of protostellar cores) is determined entirely by the specific realisation of the
initial conditions.
The adopted snapshots are summarised in Table 2 and their
relative positioning in the {l, b} plane is shown in Figure 1. These
clouds represent the main ingredients of the dust ridge (the Brick or
G0.253+0.016, Clouds c/d/e/f, and Sgr B2), and also include a lowdensity cloud upstream of the Brick (which we dub the ‘Pebble’, at
{l, b} = {0.◦ 11, 0.◦ 00}) and the downstream continuation of the
Sgr B2 complex (‘Sgr B2+’, at {l, b} = {0.◦ 72, −0.◦ 08}). Three
different projections of the combined maps are shown in Figure 2.
An animated version of this figure is available as online Supporting Information. For comparison, Figure 2 also includes contours
showing the observed gas column densities derived from the cold
dust (HiGAL, Battersby et al. in prep.) and contours showing the
observed position velocity structure in 13 CO(2-1) (Ginsburg et al.
2016).4 These have considerably lower spatial resolutions (2500 and
3000 , respectively, corresponding to 1.0 pc and 1.2 pc) than the

Throughout this work, we transform velocities from the local standard of
rest to the rest frame of Sgr A* by adding U = 14 km s−1 (Schönrich
2012), consistently with Kruijssen et al. (2015).

features of the observed dust ridge clouds can be reproduced by drawing a population of clouds from the initial conditions of Table 1 (see Table 2) and
simulating their dynamical evolution in the gravitational potential of the CMZ. For comparison, the observed position-velocity distribution of the molecular
gas in the dust ridge traced by 13 CO(2-1) (Ginsburg et al. 2016) is shown by contours at Σxvy = {0.75, 1.5} × 103 M pc−1 km−1 s (black lines in the

simulations (∼ 0.1 pc), which leads to trivial differences in spatial
structure between the simulations and observations. None the less,
these maps provide a good point of reference, because they can
be converted into physical units with relatively few assumptions.5
A number of qualitative properties of the simulated clouds immediately stand out. We list these here and quantify several of them
further in Section 3 below.
(i) Fragmentation and line-of-sight extension: The top panel of
Figure 2 shows that the clouds collapse and fragment as the turbulent energy dissipates. At the same time, the external gravitational
potential causes the fragments within each cloud to roughly maintain their mutual separation, thus inhibiting global collapse across
the full 2Rt = 15–50 pc size scales modelled here. The most massive of these fragments match the masses of young massive cluster
progenitors observed on the dust ridge (see e.g. Walker et al. 2015)
and proceed to collapse. The extensions towards the observer at
high longitudes result from the shear-driven dispersal of the outer
layers of the clouds, which may explain observational hints of expanding outer layers in the Brick (Rathborne et al. 2014a; Bally
et al. 2014). These extensions are a common feature across most of
our simulations after a few cloud dynamical times, which strongly
suggests that the real CMZ clouds at positive Galactic longitudes
may have significant depth along the line of sight, spanning a typical length scale comparable to their major axis in the plane of the
sky. Similar, radially extended ‘feathers’ are prevalent in dust extinction maps of gas clouds in extragalactic centres (e.g. Peeples &
Martini 2006). Our simulations suggest that such feathers arise due
to shearing motions in the galactic potential. When projected along
the line of sight, these feathers could plausibly be (mis)interpreted
as e.g. the base of a spiral arm or a cloud-cloud collision due to
line-of-sight confusion or multiple velocity components.
(ii) Vertical compression, large-scale filamentary structure, and
inclination: The middle panel of Figure 2 shows that the clouds attain a vertically compressed morphology just after they have passed
through pericentre (which occurs at l = −0.◦ 16). This is mainly
caused by the tidal field, which is considerably more compressive
in the vertical direction than azimuthally (see Section 3.1). The
compression generates layers and leaves the clouds highly substructured, with flocculent filamentary features running in the longitudinal direction, much akin to the structure of the Brick as observed with ALMA (Rathborne et al. 2015) and of clouds b, d, and
e as observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA, Walker et al.
2018). The tilt of the clouds towards positive longitudes and latitudes arises due to a torque experienced by the clouds as they move
through pericentre above the Galactic plane. On its approach to
pericentre passage, the leading end of the cloud arrives first and
is pulled upwards. This combination of inclination and flattening
is a common feature across all of our simulations and matches that
of the observed contours at the positions of the Brick, clouds e/f,
Sgr B2, and Sgr B2+.
(iii) Velocity gradient, shear, and kinematic complexity: The bottom panel shows that the clouds develop a velocity gradient with
a direction opposite to the orbital motion. This counter-gradient
is driven by shear, which causes the side of the cloud facing the

to convert dust column densities to mass densities. To translate the 13 CO
flux to a mass density, we assume a 13 CO-to-H2 conversion factor of
α(13 CO) = 22.8 M pc−2 (K km s−1 )−1 (Schuller et al. 2017;
Cormier et al. 2018), which is particularly appropriate in high-column density environments like the CMZ.

Galactic centre to move faster than the side facing away from the
Galactic centre (see Section 3.2). Again, this is a common feature of all models and qualitatively matches the velocity gradient
of the Brick, clouds e/f, and the Sgr B2 complex. However, it is
also quite sensitive to the realisation of the initial velocity field,
which was chosen to be consistent with the onset of contraction
from a shearing gas reservoir (see Section 2.1). Clouds with zero
initial spin angular momentum exhibit significantly weaker velocity gradients. Finally, this panel also reveals significant kinematic
complexity in the Sgr B2 region, which is caused by the superposition of clouds along the line of sight as the orbit curves off, away
from the observer. This matches the observed, complex kinematic
structure of the cloud complex spanned by Sgr B2 and Sgr B2+
(e.g. Henshaw et al. 2016a) and provides a plausible alternative to
the currently canonical interpretation of this complexity as a key
piece of evidence for a cloud-cloud collision (e.g. Mehringer et al.
1993; Hasegawa et al. 1994; Sato et al. 2000; Jones et al. 2008).
We find that no such collision is necessary to generate the large degree of kinematic complexity in the Sgr B2 region. Instead, this is
naturally reproduced by the combination of fragmentation and the
orbital geometry.
In summary, the clouds’ evolution in a background potential
and the pericentre passage initially turns them into inclined, substructured, spinning pancakes, before the combination of fragmentation and orbital curvature generates highly complex {l, b, vlos }
structures. We find that a wide range of properties of the observed
dust ridge clouds (contours in Figure 2) are reproduced by making
a suitable selection from the set of simulations. As stated before,
this is an interesting result, because the initial conditions of the
simulations were chosen to be representative of the observed range
of physical conditions (i.e. column densities, volume densities, and
velocity dispersions) in the clouds upstream from pericentre (see
Section 2.1). This shows that the morphology and kinematics of
the dust ridge clouds are consistent with their deformation due to
the background potential and the preceding pericentre passage as
modelled here, under the plausible condition that their initial properties were similar to those currently observed upstream.
More broadly, Figure 2 illustrates how the evolution of molecular clouds in the CMZ is closely coupled to their orbital dynamics. As will be quantified further in the next sections, these results
can be generalised to any (extra)galactic centre where the rotation
curve turns over from being flat to v ∝ rβ with 1/2 < β < 1,
which is far from unusual (see e.g. Miyamoto & Nagai 1975; Rubin et al. 1980; Persic & Salucci 1995; Erroz-Ferrer et al. 2016).
For any rotation curve with such a turnover, the inflow of gas
from larger galactocentric radii is predicted to stall due to a decrease of the shear, which leads to the accumulation of the gas in
a ring-like structure like the 100-pc stream (Krumholz & Kruijssen 2015). During this accumulation, the orbital motion of the gas
is synchronised by hydrodynamic forces, after which the stream
fragments into clouds undergoing synchronised, semi-ballistic motion on an eccentric orbit that retains some memory of the non-zero
radial inflow velocity (this behaviour has also been found in threedimensional simulations, see e.g. Emsellem et al. 2015).6
Our simulations show the clouds on the stream are torqued,

6

The eccentric stream thus exists within the ring-like region of minimal
(but non-zero) shear, which is 45 < r/pc < 115 in the gravitational potential of Launhardt et al. (2002, see Section 3.2 below and Krumholz &
Kruijssen 2015) and closely matches the pericentre and apocentre radii of
the stream (rp = 60 pc and ra = 120 pc, respectively).
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

Structure and kinematics of Galactic Centre clouds
compressed, and stretched, each of which has the potential to fundamentally change their subsequent evolution. Given the strength
of these interactions, the dynamical coupling with the host galaxy
may induce collapse and star formation in certain ‘hotspots’, which
appear as evolutionary streamlines of progressively advanced states
of star formation and feedback. Such evolutionary sequences may
be ubiquitous in extragalactic centres too, but they are unlikely to
be strictly monotonic – Table 2 and Figure 2 show that some diversity of initial conditions is needed to reproduce the observed CMZ
clouds, indicating that the responses of these clouds to the background potential and pericentre passage may differ. In the next section, we quantify how the morphology and kinematics of the clouds
are affected by their orbital dynamics.

QUANTITATIVE PROPERTIES OF SIMULATED
CLOUDS

We now turn to a quantitative discussion of the simulations, focussing on the spatial structure and kinematics of the clouds. In
addition to an extensive discussion of the simulations following
clouds on eccentric orbits, we also include a brief comparison to
a set of control simulations of clouds on circular orbits. The full set
of clouds on circular orbits is presented in Appendix A.
3.1

Spatial structure

The morphological evolution of the clouds is quantified in Figure 3
for all five simulations. For reference, a colour composite of the inner CMZ with the orbital model highlighted is included as the top
panel. The figure shows several key (observable) properties of the
simulated clouds as a function of Galactic longitude, i.e. the dimensions of the clouds in the plane of the sky, their aspect ratios, and
their plane-of-sky column densities. All quantities are calculated
using the gas with densities ρ > 104 cm−3 as in Figure 2, which
represents the centrally concentrated components of the clouds and
is traced by most of the dust emission (Longmore et al. 2013a),
as well as molecular line tracers (such as HCN and NH3 , see e.g.
Mills & Morris 2013; Rathborne et al. 2014a). The dimensions of
the clouds in the Galactic longitudinal (δx) and latitudinal (δz) directions are obtained by calculating the centre of mass in each coordinate (xcm or zcm ) and finding the corresponding intervals that
enclose half of the mass (i.e. xcm ± δx or zcm ± δz). The aspect
ratios follow as δz/δx.7 Finally, the average column densities of
the clouds (Σ) are calculated in a mass-weighted fashion over the
rectangle spanned by a cloud’s half-mass intervals (thus together
enclosing less than half of its mass) as

with Σlocal (x, z) the local column density at the coordinate {x, z}.
The weighting by mass emphasises the column density at which
most of the mass resides and makes it insensitive to the total spatial
extent of the clouds. This is desirable, because the simulations follow the condensation of clouds from a gas reservoir that is initially
larger than the observed clouds (see Table 1 and Section 2.1). In
addition, we prevent dilution by focussing a window on the cloud

centre of mass. By taking a mass-weighted average over this region
of interest rather than an area-weighted one, we predict the typical
column density expected to be observed in CMZ clouds.
3.1.1

Cloud dimensions and aspect ratios

Focusing on the cloud dimensions and aspect ratios (second and
third panels of Figure 3), we see that they all exhibit a very similar evolution. In the Galactic longitudinal direction, the clouds are
stretched by a factor of 2 as they pass through pericentre. This is
a combined result of the clouds’ orbital rotation and the fact that
shear extends them further in the azimuthal direction than the radial
direction. The vertical extent of the clouds is affected differently –
in the Galactic latitudinal direction, the clouds are flattened by a
factor of 0.5. This arises due to a combination of two effects.
Firstly, geometric convergence of the orbital structure towards
pericentre implies that all dimensions perpendicular to the direction of motion are compressed by a factor of rp /r0 ≈ 0.67, with
r0 = 90 pc the initial radius and rp = 60 pc the pericentric radius. Radially, this occurs because all orbits of individual mass elements within a cloud are compressed into a smaller radial interval
as the cloud approaches pericentre. In the vertical direction, pericentre represents the convergence point for mass elements that are
vertically offset initially. In itself, this factor of rp /r0 is capable
of explaining the behaviour found in the simulations. It naturally
leads to extreme aspect ratios (combining differential acceleration
and geometric convergence yields vl,0 rp /vl,p r0 ≈ 0.39) as found
in the second panel, which reach latitudinal-to-longitudinal size ratios as low as δz/δx = 0.25.
A second, possibly more important mechanism leading to a
vertical compression is provided by the tidal field. Assuming a
power law enclosed mass profile Mencl ∝ rα and hence a rotation
curve v ∝ r(α−1)/2 with angular velocity Ω = v/r ∝ r(α−3)/2 ,
the tidal tensor in the CMZ is given by:

where Φ is the gravitational potential, xi is the ith component of the
position vector, qΦ is the vertical-to-planar axis ratio of the background potential, which indicates its degree of flattening, and we
have chosen the coordinate system such that the tensor follows the
order of the radial (r), tangential (φ), and vertical (z) directions.
For the eccentric orbit under consideration, with qΦ = 0.63
and α = 2.2 (Kruijssen et al. 2015), all terms on the diagonal of
the tidal tensor are negative and the tidal field is fully compressive. A fully compressive tidal field exists where α > 2. In the
CMZ potential derived by Launhardt et al. (2002) that we use here,
this corresponds to the radial range 45 < r/pc < 115 (Kruijssen et al. 2015). This nearly exactly matches the radial extent of the
gas stream,8 giving rise to the somewhat unusual situation in which
there is non-zero shear, but the tidal radii of the clouds are elevated
8

This may not be a coincidence. In the galactic centre models by
Krumholz & Kruijssen (2015) and Krumholz et al. (2017), the inward transport of gas is driven by shear, which exists for α < 3. The closer the rotation
curve is to solid-body (α = 3), the slower the radial transport. In the CMZ,
shear is minimal at a peak value of α ≈ 2.3, which is reached in the compressive region 45 < r/pc < 115. As a result, the inflow slows down and
gas accumulates, thus forming the observed gas stream, where it is capable
of reaching high densities and becomes prone to gravitational collapse and
star formation. Observations of the CMZ match this picture, as the gas on

each of them to a simulation as in Table 2 and Figure 2), as indicated by
the legends in panel 3. To quantify the effect of the non-zero orbital eccentricity, transparent lines show the fiducial cloud on a circular orbit for
comparison. The vertical dotted line marks the position of pericentre. This

by their orbital motion through the gravitational potential of the CMZ.

relative to those in an extensive tidal field. The radial, azimuthal,
and vertical components of the tidal field have relative strengths
(Trr : Tφφ : Tzz ) = (0.2 : 1 : 2.6), indicating that the strongest
compression takes place in the vertical direction. The compressive
tidal field in the azimuthal direction partially cancels the orbital
stretching by shear described above, which explains why the vertical extent of the clouds gets compressed more steeply than their
longitudinal extent increases. Put simply, the evolution in a background potential turns the clouds into pancakes.
Even on a circular orbit, the geometry of the tidal field causes
the clouds to be strongly flattened (grey solid line in Figure 3, also
see Dale et al. 2019), with an aspect ratio δz/δx = 1/2.6 ≈ 0.38.
This compression is enhanced by shear-driven azimuthal extension
of the clouds. In addition, each of the components of the tidal tensor increases in strength by a factor of (rp /r0 )α−3 ≈ 1.4 as the
cloud moves from apocentre to pericentre. This amplifies the tidal
compression and causes clouds on eccentric orbits to be flattened
more quickly (by up to 0.2 Myr) than those on circular orbits. In
the simulations, the tidal field thus sets the minimum aspect ratio
of δz/δx = 0.25, whereas the pericentre passage accelerates the
time by which this is achieved. Note that the Galactic longitude at
which the pericentre passage takes place generally does not mark
maxima or minima in any of the observables. The clouds respond
to external perturbations on a crossing time, which means that they
‘overshoot’ the time of pericentre passage in terms of their structural (and kinematic, see Section 3.2) evolution.
Because the dimensions of the clouds are directly observable,
we do not normalise their size evolution by the initial dimensions
in the second panel of Figure 3. However, it is clear that the relative
size evolution exhibited by the range of modelled clouds is nearly
identical, independently of the initial conditions (e.g. density, velocity dispersion, or virial state). The high-density simulation represents the only exception, in that it evolves much more quickly
than the other clouds, reaching its most extreme aspect ratio some
0.◦ 2 in longitude before the other simulations do. The more rapid
evolution seen in this simulation is a simple result of its high density and short dynamical time – the cloud initiates its collapse prior
to the pericentre passage, dynamically decouples from the background potential and, as a result, amplifies the initial perturbation
imposed by its orbital motion on a shorter time-scale.9 Given that
the presented simulations are drawn from a representative set of
initial conditions, the range spanned by the simulations provides a
prediction for the dimensions expected to be observed for real CMZ
clouds.
After the minimum aspect ratio has been reached, δz/δx increases again, because the azimuthal extension of the clouds is projected along the line of sight as the orbit curves away from the
observer. However, this proceeds more rapidly for the clouds on
eccentric orbits, due to the torque experienced towards their offplane pericentre passage as the leading end of the cloud arrives
first and is pulled upwards (see Section 2.2), which induces a slow
clockwise rotation around the line of sight. As a result, the flattened
clouds become inclined relative to the Galactic plane (see Figure 2),
which causes the aspect ratio along the {x, z} coordinates to return
to unity even when the clouds are still tidally flattened. This has
the 100-pc stream is only marginally stable, whereas the gas at larger radii is
characterised by a Toomre (1964) parameter Q > 5 (Kruijssen et al. 2014).
9 The same dynamical decoupling due to a local dominance of self-gravity
takes place in the other clouds on the scales of individual, dense fragments.
The high-density simulation is the only model in which the global density
is sufficiently high for the entire cloud to achieve this.

Structure and kinematics of Galactic Centre clouds
a pronounced effect on the snapshot representing the Brick – the
cloud in Figure 2 is clearly flattened, with a minor-to-major axis ratio of ∼ 0.3, but is inclined relative to the Galactic plane by ∼ 35◦ ,
resulting in the elevated aspect ratio of δz/δx ∼ 0.65 in the third
panel of Figure 3 (indicated by the black square). Eventually, the
flattening is erased altogether, most likely by turbulent mixing during the collapse of the clouds.
3.1.2

Cloud column densities

Finally, the bottom panel of Figure 3 shows the evolution of the
cloud column densities observed in the plane of the sky. We note
that these densities represent simulations of single clouds and do
not accurately reflect the stacked composite image of Figure 2.
With the exception of the high-density simulation, in which the column density decreases due to its rapid conversion into sink particles
(see below), most clouds exhibit a similar evolutionary progression.
Initially, the column density decreases due to the differential acceleration and shear along the orbit (which primarily takes place in
the plane of the sky) and the corresponding longitudinal stretching of the clouds. However, eventually the compressive tidal field
takes over, resulting in a significant (factor-of-several) increase of
the column density that commences during the pericentre passage.
By contrast, the models with circular orbits undergo a weaker column density increase (< 0.3 dex) that sets in ∼ 0.1 Myr later.
Near the position of the Brick, the column density reaches a local
maximum, after which the cloud slowly expands in the latitudinal
direction as it emerges from the bottom of the gravitational potential along its orbit. Due to this expansion, the global column density
decreases slightly by 25–50 per cent (naturally, this does not occur
for the clouds evolving on circular orbits).
After the clouds reach the longitude of cloud e/f (l ∼ 0.◦ 5),
the column density monotonically increases. The cause for this increase is twofold. Firstly, the orbital curvature away from the observer geometrically compresses the projected dimensions of the
clouds, because their radial extents at the end of the simulations
are generally smaller than their azimuthal dimensions (cf. Figure 2
and see Dale et al. 2019). The resulting orientation of the clouds
along the line of sight is the main driver for the sharp upturn of the
column density near the position of Sgr B2. Secondly, the dynamical perturbation from the background potential weakens at larger
galactocentric radii, allowing the velocity dispersion to decrease
(see Section 3.2) and gravitational collapse to set in.
In all simulated clouds, the most tightly bound clumps proceed to collapse and form sink particles at a high rate. Given the
dimensions and column densities shown in Figure 3, the cloudaveraged free-fall time follows directly as tff ∝ (δy/Σ)1/2 and for
the clouds considered here (δy ≈ 5 pc and Σ ≈ 2×103 M pc−2 )
has typical values of tff ∼ 0.4 Myr. Relative to the orbital dynamical time at pericentre Ω−1 = rp /vorb,p ≈ 0.3 Myr (which is the
minimum along the orbit), this time-scale is comparable, implying
that gravitational collapse proceeds rapidly once it has set in. While
this rapid collapse is physical in nature, it leads to an unphysical
bias towards a nearly monotonically decreasing column density in
the high-density simulation. In the absence of feedback or magnetic
fields, it is the only simulation to reach a star formation efficiency
of 90 per cent by the time the cloud reaches apocentre at the end
of the simulation. The column densities of the other clouds are not
significantly affected by the conversion of gas into sink particles,
because the star formation efficiencies stay considerably lower, at
15–50 per cent.
Combining the range of column densities spanned by all simuMNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

lations, we see that any systematic evolutionary trends with Galactic longitude or time span a factor of 1.5–4 between the minimum
column density and that at the end of the simulation. This is smaller
than the total range of column densities spanned by the initial conditions, which is a factor of ∼ 6 and is representative for the variety of clouds observed upstream of the dust ridge (see Section 2.1).
This difference in dynamic range means that, analogously to the
cloud dimensions in the second panel of Figure 3, variations in column density along the dust ridge primarily trace variations in the
initial conditions of the clouds. It also explains why observational
studies have found only limited evidence for trends of the column
density with Galactic longitude (e.g. Krieger et al. 2017). A comparison between these results and the observed column densities is
presented in Section 4.2.
In summary, the morphological characteristics of the simulations all sketch a similar picture, across the full range of initial
conditions. Driven by the background potential and the orbital eccentricity, the combination of geometric convergence during pericentre passage and the compressive tidal field result in a flattened
and inclined, pancake-like cloud morphology and enhanced densities, eventually leading to fragmentation and gravitational collapse
once the clouds have passed pericentre. The role of the pericentre
passage is to accelerate this evolution relative to clouds evolving on
circular orbits.
3.2

Kinematics and dynamics

The kinematic evolution of the clouds is quantified in Figure 4
for all five simulations. For reference, a colour composite of the
inner CMZ with the orbital model highlighted is included as the
top panel. The figure shows several key properties of the simulated clouds as a function of Galactic longitude, i.e. their line-ofsight velocity dispersions, their line-of-sight velocity gradients in
Galactic longitude, and their spin angular momenta. As before, the
quantities are calculated for the gas with densities ρ > 104 cm−3
(cf. Figure 2), except for the spin angular momentum (see below).
The line-of-sight velocity dispersions (σlos ) are obtained by calculating the standard deviation of the line-of-sight velocities of the
particles within the rectangle spanned by the one-dimensional halfmass extents, i.e. {xcm ±δx, zcm ±δz}. This is equivalent to taking
the mass-weighted average of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion
at each coordinate σlos,local (x, z) as
R xcm +δx R zcm +δz

−δx z
−δz
σlos = cm R xcmcm
. (3)
+δx R zcm +δz
Σlocal (x, z)dxdz

Likewise, we calculate the line-of-sight velocity gradient
(dvlos /dl) by carrying out an orthogonal linear regression to the
{l, vlos } distribution of the gas map within {xcm ± δx, zcm ± δz}
(Boggs & Rogers 1990). Again, this is equivalent to a massweighted fit to the position-velocity image. Finally, the spin
angular momenta (Lz ) are calculated without making any cuts
in density or position, because this is a physical quantity used
to describe the entire cloud and interpret the predicted velocity
gradients, rather than an observable quantity. Given a population
of Npart particles, we obtain
X
Lz =
mi (rxy,i × vxy,i ),

where mi is the particle mass, rxy,i is the position vector in the
Galactic plane relative to the cloud’s centre of mass, and vxy,i is the
velocity vector in the Galactic plane relative to the cloud’s centre
of motion.

Cloud line-of-sight velocity dispersions

(5)

where A and B are the Oort (1927) constants, Ω = 1.7 Myr−1 is
the average angular velocity of the orbital model (Table 1 of Kruijssen et al. 2015), and Rh is normalised to a value typical for the
simulated clouds at the onset of the dust ridge (l ≈ 0.◦ 1), where
Rh = 3–12 pc. The resulting velocity differential is similar to
the lowest velocity dispersions reached by the simulations, even to
the extent that the minimum σlos of the clouds is linearly related
to their radii (compare Figure 4 to the average of δx and δz in
Figure 3), as predicted by equation (5). This shows that cloud collapse and fragmentation from a shearing medium is significantly
affected by galactic dynamics. The linear relation between the velocity differential δv and cloud radius Rh may thus explain why
the size-linewidth relation of CMZ clouds is steeper (σ ∝ R0.7 ,
Shetty et al. 2012; Kauffmann et al. 2017a) than the classical slope
(σ ∝ R0.5 , e.g. Larson 1981; Heyer & Dame 2015) found in the
Galactic disc (also see Dale et al. 2019). We intend to quantify this
possibility further in a future paper.
The time-scale on which the minimum σlos is reached varies.
If we assume that most of the velocity dispersion seen in the
simulations reflects turbulent motion, the relevant time-scale is the
turbulence dissipation time-scale, which in the absence of turbulence driving or other external perturbations is tdiss = R/σ, with
R the scale on which the initial turbulence is driven (e.g. Mac Low
& Klessen 2004). If instead the velocity dispersion reflects ordered
motion, it is expected to evolve on a crossing time, which is also
given by tcr = R/σ. In both expressions, we take R to represent
the initial cloud truncation radius Rt as in Table 1, resulting in
tdiss = tcr ≈ 0.56 Myr for all simulations. As expected, this is
similar to the initial e-folding time of the velocity dispersions in
Figure 4. Perhaps unsurprisingly in view of the varying external
potential of our simulated clouds, the decay does not continue, but
eventually a minimum σlos is reached. The time-scale required for
reaching this minimum is shortest for the high-density simulation at
t−t0 ≈ 0.4 Myr, which is similar to tdiss and also closely matches
the cloud’s initial free-fall time (see Table 1). The other simulations
reach their minimum σlos at around t − t0 = 0.6–0.8 Myr. Given
that the evolution of the cloud in the high-density simulation is
largely decoupled from the background potential, as the cloud is

Because the velocity dispersion is a mass-weighted quantity, this expression requires the characteristic radius within the cloud where its mass
resides, i.e. the half-mass radius Rh rather than the truncation radius Rt .

First focusing on the line-of-sight velocity dispersions (second
panel of Figure 4), we see that the clouds initially lose internal
kinetic energy, reach a minimum near the onset of the dust ridge
at l ≈ 0.◦ 1, and increase again towards Sgr B2. The initial decline
of σlos is not surprising, because we do not include any explicit
turbulent energy driving in the simulations. Over time, the internal kinetic energy of the clouds should decrease. The only possible
source of internal kinetic energy is the shear and associated tidal
torques generated by the background potential, which effectively
set a (cloud radius-dependent) velocity dispersion floor. Across the
radii of the clouds shown in Figure 3, the shear-driven velocity differential across a cloud of scale Rh , in a frame that orbits the Galactic centre with the cloud centroid, is given by10

through the gravitational potential of the CMZ.

undergoing collapse anyway (cf. Section 3.1), the correspondence
between the minimum σlos and the initial free-fall time is to be expected. However, the evolution of the other clouds is affected more
strongly by their interaction with the background potential, indicating that the additional internal kinetic energy driven by their motion
in a shearing potential may be responsible for increasing σlos .
The above interpretation is underlined by the circular-orbit
control experiments presented in Appendix A and Dale et al.
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

Structure and kinematics of Galactic Centre clouds
(2019). Clouds on circular orbits experience a similar evolution
to the eccentric simulations discussed here, albeit somewhat more
slowly – as in Section 3.1, we find that the pericentre passage accelerates the evolution of the clouds, driving an increase of their
velocity dispersion in less than 0.2 Myr post-pericentre. However,
our additional, isolated control runs that do not include an external
potential at all reach their minimum σlos even more quickly (Dale
et al. 2019), showing that the presence of shear is key in extending
the clouds’ resilience against internal kinetic (or turbulent) energy
dissipation and collapse.
Once collapse eventually sets in, it leads to a clear increase
of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion, which is primarily driven
by the conversion of potential energy into internal kinetic energy
(as reported for simulations of isolated clouds by e.g. VázquezSemadeni et al. 2007; Ibáñez-Mejı́a et al. 2016). In our simulations,
this happens at high Galactic longitudes, where the perceived increase of σlos is boosted further by orbital curvature. As quantified
by Dale et al. (2019), the azimuthal velocity dispersion (i.e. along
the orbital direction of motion) is enhanced by shear and typically
exceeds the radial velocity dispersion. Towards high longitudes, the
orbital motion becomes parallel to the line of sight and σlos becomes dominated by the azimuthal component of the velocity dispersion, thus adding to its increase. As in the discussion of the bottom panel in Figure 3, we note that these velocity dispersions represent simulations of single clouds and do not accurately reflect the
stacked composite image of Figure 2. The superposition of multiple
clouds along the line of sight would lead to an even larger increase
of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion than reported in Figure 4,
which shows the velocity dispersions of the single clouds in each
of our simulations.
Altogether, we see that our model makes the strong prediction
that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion should increase steeply
with longitude for l & 0.◦ 5. Given that the presented simulations
are drawn from a representative set of initial conditions, the range
in σlos spanned by the simulations provides a prediction for the velocity dispersions expected to be observed for real CMZ clouds.
We reiterate that the superposition of multiple clouds along the line
of sight may cause deviations upward of our predicted range of
velocity dispersions. A comparison between these results and the
observed velocity dispersions is presented in Section 4.2.
3.2.2

Cloud velocity gradients and spin angular momenta

The third panel of Figure 4 shows the evolution of the line-ofsight velocity gradient in Galactic longitude (−dvlos /dl), which
evolves substantially along the orbit. For all simulations, the velocity gradient generally has the opposite sign of the orbital rotation,
in that vlos decreases with Galactic longitude. This is also evident
in the bottom panel of Figure 2, which shows that the line tracing the orbital motion in {l, vlos } space is nearly perpendicular to
the {l, vlos } orientations of the individual clouds. We interpret this
counter-gradient as the imprint of shear, which causes the inside
of the cloud to overtake the outside, thus generating anti-clockwise
rotation for the clockwise orbital motion modelled here.
Using equation (5), it is straightforward to estimate the magnitude of the shear-driven velocity gradient in the idealised case
of a cloud in virial equilibrium without internal kinetic (or turbulent) energy dissipation. At the adopted distance of the Galactic
Centre, 10 ≈ 2.41 pc, implying that we expect a typical sheardriven velocity gradient of −dvlos /dl = 1.6 km s−1 arcmin−1
or −dvlos /dl = 0.7 km s−1 pc−1 . However, deviations from this
gradient are expected in a dynamically evolving, turbulent cloud.
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

11

Because the gradient is expected to be driven by shear, it manifests itself mainly as an azimuthal velocity differential between radially displaced mass elements. The resulting line-of-sight velocity
gradient naturally vanishes close to l = 0◦ , where the azimuthal
motion is perpendicular to the line of sight. In addition, the pericentre passage on the eccentric orbits is accompanied by a vertical
compression and torques (see Section 2.2), which can cause the
driven internal kinetic energy to be dissipated. Indeed, Figure 4
shows that the velocity gradient at pericentre is weaker than the
reference value estimated above. However, after the clouds climb
out of the bottom of the gravitational potential and eventually undergo gravitational collapse, the conservation of angular momentum causes the clouds to increase their angular velocity, thus steepening the velocity gradient. This too can be seen in Figure 4, in
which the velocity gradients steepen more strongly for the eccentric orbits than the circular-orbit control run and reach extreme values of −dvlos /dl = 3–10 km s−1 arcmin−1 near the position of
Sgr B2.
As shown by the full set of model lines in Figure 4, the initial
velocity gradients are nearly indistinguishable, but quickly diverge
during their subsequent evolution. The initial similarity of dvlos /dl
is by construction, because each of the simulated clouds has been
initialised with a velocity field that is consistent with having formed
out of the shearing medium, which effectively sets their initial angular velocity and thus their velocity gradient. For an incompressible cloud, the shear from the external potential would maintain this
gradient during the simulation. However, the conservation of spin
angular momentum (which is only satisfied to within 20 per cent for
l . 0.◦ 5 due to tidal shear-driven torques, see below) during cloud
collapse and the corresponding steepening of the velocity gradient
implies a strong dependence on the initial cloud density. Figure 3
shows that differences in the cloud density determine when collapse
sets in, causing the high-density cloud to have become a factor of
∼ 5 smaller than the fiducial one by the end of the simulation. The
same factor of ∼ 5 offset appears in the velocity gradient, as the
high-density cloud has been spun up by its gravitational collapse.11
While all simulations exhibit some degree of counter-rotation, we
thus find that the magnitude of the resulting velocity gradient is set
by the initial volume density.
Due to the stochastic evolution of the clouds’ substructure,
the fitted velocity gradients occasionally flip sign, especially at the
shallow gradients near l = 0◦ and in the high-density simulation,
which is characterised by rapidly evolving substructure due to its
short dynamical time. Over the course of the simulation, it is the
only cloud in which the vast majority of the dense fragments end
up accreting onto its centre of mass, causing its mass to grow while
inducing major fluctuations of most quantities shown in Figure 3
and Figure 4. In the velocity gradients, these brief episodes manifest themselves as interruptions of the lines.
The Brick is known to have a strong velocity gradient in the direction opposite to its orbital motion (Rathborne et al. 2014a). Using the high-density simulation (which best represents the Brick,
see Table 2), we carry out a linear regression to the position11

The critical role of collapse in increasing the magnitude of the velocity
gradient in the high-density simulation at l & 0.◦ 2 is underlined by the fact
that the spin angular momentum decreases for these Galactic longitudes
(again due to torques from the background potential, see below). This means
that the evolution of the gradient must be dominated by a combination of
change in the moment of inertia (i.e. contraction) and viewing angle (i.e. the
azimuthal motion getting projected along the line of sight due to orbital
curvature).

12

velocity distribution to quantify this gradient in the simulation. Figure 2 shows that the cloud is lopsided, with the main gas concentration located off-centre at {l, y} = {0.◦ 27, −65 pc}. Centring
the window on this concentration and increasing its width to l =
{0.◦ 303, 0.◦ 248} such that it encloses the observed ∼ 8 pc size of
the Brick (see Section 4.3), we obtain a line-of-sight velocity gradient of −dvlos /dl ≈ 5.9 km s−1 arcmin−1 . This is similar to the
observed velocity gradients reported in the literature, which range
from −dvlos /dl = 7.43 ± 0.34 km s−1 arcmin−1 (Rathborne
et al. 2014a)12 to −dvlos /dl = 9.50 ± 0.34 km s−1 arcmin−1
(Federrath et al. 2016, where the error bars correspond to the propagated distance uncertainty). Given that the high-density simulation
reproduces the observed value to within ∼ 25 per cent, we propose
that the Brick’s velocity gradient opposite to the orbital direction
of motion is explained by shear. At least qualitatively, shear likely
also explains why clouds e/f and the Sgr B2 complex show signs
of counter-rotation in their observed {l, vlos } distribution (see the
bottom panel of Figure 2).
Finally, the bottom panel of Figure 4 illustrates the effect of
shear during the clouds’ pericentre passages on their spin angular momentum Lz . As discussed in Section 2.1, the initial velocity
fields of the clouds were chosen to match the expected net rotation
due to shear. However, the spin angular momenta in the simulations
increase further, reaching a maximum at the position of the Brick
(l ∼ 0.◦ 2), briefly after pericentre. Up to the point of maximum Lz ,
the five simulations are nearly indistinguishable, indicating that the
increase of the spin angular momentum is insensitive to the initial
conditions. This is a natural result of the fact that the clouds all experience the same tidal shear-induced torques during their orbital
motion and their pericentre passage, while the initial evolution of
their moments of inertia is very similar (see the homologous radius
evolution at these longitudes in Figure 3).
As the clouds recede from the Galactic Centre after pericentre passage, the spin angular momentum decreases again. However, it does so much more quickly than the increase towards the
maximum and drops below the initial value of Lz . This is caused
by the influence of tidal shear-driven torques on the clouds. The
magnitudes of these torques (and hence the rate at which the spin
angular momentum changes) are affected by cloud collapse, as illustrated by the difference between the five simulations. The fiducial and low/high velocity dispersion simulations are indistinguishable, because they have the same free-fall times (see Table 1) and
a largely homologous radius evolution. However, the low-density
simulation (which collapses relatively slowly) loses its spin angular momentum even more quickly than the fiducial simulation,
whereas the high-density simulation (which achieves collapse relatively quickly) loses spin angular momentum more slowly. This
difference reflects the contrasting moments of inertia of the clouds.
As the high-density simulation collapses more quickly, it is less affected by the torque driven by tidal shear. Finally, the cloud on a
circular orbit does not experience an enhanced tidal torque at pericentre, retaining Lz /Lz (0) > 1 some 0.3 Myr longer than the
other clouds.
In summary, the kinematic and dynamical characteristics of
the simulations all sketch a similar picture. Driven by the pres-

The value we provide here differs from that quoted by Rathborne
et al. (2014a), because we correct a small conversion error. The gradient −dvlos /dl = 7.43 ± 0.34 km s−1 arcmin−1 is obtained directly
from the intensity-weighted velocity field of the Brick in the MALT90
HNCO 4(0,4)–3(0,3) emission provided by Rathborne et al. (2014a).

ence of the background potential, the associated tidal shear, and
the resulting torques, the clouds exhibit net rotation and a sustained
floor of their internal kinetic energies, part of which may be translated into turbulent motion. The corresponding spin angular momentum increases somewhat (by 20 per cent) due to continued tidal
shear-driven torques, which affect the clouds more rapidly due to
the pericentre passage. Observationally, these processes manifest
themselves through elevated velocity dispersions once gravitational
collapse has set in (at l & 0.◦ 5), which at these longitudes are increased further by shear acting along the line of sight due to orbital
curvature, and strong velocity gradients opposite to the orbital direction of motion. Indeed, both of these features are observed in
the real CMZ, in the form of extreme velocity dispersions towards
Sgr B2 (e.g. Henshaw et al. 2016a) and a strong velocity gradient
in the Brick opposite to the orbital rotation (e.g. Rathborne et al.
2014a; Federrath et al. 2016).

DISCUSSION

This paper presents the structural and kinematic properties of five
different numerical simulations of molecular clouds following the
best-fitting eccentric orbit in the gravitational potential of the CMZ
from Kruijssen et al. (2015). It is found that the evolution of the
clouds is closely coupled to the orbital dynamics. Specifically, their
sizes, aspect ratios, column densities, velocity dispersions, lineof-sight velocity gradients, and spin angular momenta are demonstrated to be strongly influenced by the background potential and
the pericentre passage. Following the discussion in Section 3, we
summarise in Table 3 how the various physical mechanisms included in our model affect the observables discussed in this work.
In this section, we briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of
the model, present a brief comparison to observations, and provide
its key predictions for future observational work.

4.1

Strengths and shortcomings of the model

The presented simulations capture the orbital and internal dynamics of the clouds, but omit several physical mechanisms that are potentially important, such as magnetic fields, cosmic rays, detailed
chemistry, and stellar feedback. While this may obstruct drawing
any conclusions concerning the absolute star formation rates and
efficiencies of the clouds, it does allow us to isolate and characterise
the morphological and dynamical evolution of the clouds, which is
the main focus of this paper. Above all, this enables us to perform
controlled experiments and obtain a systematic understanding of
the interplay between cloud evolution and galactic dynamics in the
CMZ, with implications for galactic centres in general.
Stellar feedback is not expected to strongly affect the structure and dynamics of the clouds prior to advanced gravitational
collapse and widespread star formation, which is not achieved until the position of Sgr B2. Therefore, it is a reasonable omission
in the context of this work. Chemistry is an important ingredient
when generating synthetic line emission maps for direct comparison to observations (in the context of the CMZ, see e.g. Bertram
et al. 2016). Clearly, a detailed chemical network and appropriate
radiative transfer modelling enables the generation of considerably
more realistic maps than the volume density limit of ρ > 104 cm−3
that we adopted to create Figure 2. However, we note that the CMZ
clouds host notoriously complex chemistry, excitation conditions,
and optical depth effects, to the extent that clouds have a different

Note: The symbols (−, 0, +) indicate the sign of the change induced by each physical mechanism on
the variable in each column. Mechanisms unique to eccentric orbits are marked with a star. A positive
change of the spin angular momentum implies anti-clockwise rotation when looking towards negative
values of the specified axis. ‘Geometric convergence’ includes the effect of ‘differential acceleration’
towards pericentre. Because the listed physical mechanisms are all related to the background potential,
we adopt a polar coordinate system centred on Sgr A*. We encourage the reader interested in a
particular element of this table to consult the discussion in Section 3, which presents the projection of
the polar coordinates relative to the line of sight due to orbital curvature, as well as the detailed time
evolution of these quantities.

appearance in each molecular line (e.g. Rathborne et al. 2015). Accurately modelling the molecular chemistry necessary for following the high-density gas tracers often used to observed CMZ clouds
remains out of reach for the foreseeable future. Importantly, a considerable part of our analysis focuses on kinematics. Observational
velocity measurements are less affected by molecular abundances
or chemistry than integrated intensity measurements. Finally, magnetic fields have been suggested to affect the dynamics of CMZ
clouds on sub-pc scales (e.g. Pillai et al. 2015). However, this is
based on the total magnetic field strength. In the absence of a coherent magnetic field, the unordered (turbulent) magnetic field mainly
acts as a source of pressure (for recent discussions, see e.g. Li &
Henning 2011; Pillai et al. 2015; Federrath et al. 2016). Estimates
of the turbulent magnetic field strength yield Alfvénic Mach numbers MA > 1 (Federrath et al. 2016), indicating that supersonic
turbulence dominates the cloud structure. Our results substantiate
this finding – the fact that our simulations reproduce the observed
spatial structure and kinematics of CMZ clouds, suggests that magnetic fields may not be dynamically important, but instead trace the
turbulent flow in the CMZ clouds.
Another assumption worth discussing is the initial density profile of the clouds. The adopted Gaussian density profile does not
represent a hydrostatic equilibrium solution, meaning that some
part of the clouds’ evolution may be caused by their initial progression towards equilibrium. Unfortunately, the presence of an external gravitational potential implies that even density profiles satisfying hydrostatic equilibrium in isolation, such as cored power laws
(e.g. McKee & Ostriker 2007; Keto & Caselli 2010), would still require an initial equilibration phase. To answer whether a significant
part of the observed cloud evolution is caused by the choice of initial density profile, we therefore compare the simulations discussed
here to isolated control runs in Dale et al. (2019),13 finding that the
evolutionary trends presented in this work are unique to the clouds
evolving in the background potential of the CMZ. Reassuringly,
this shows that any influence of the initial density profile on the results is subdominant relative to the role of the external potential in
governing cloud evolution.
A final caveat is the choice of orbital model. Other parameterisations or dynamical models for the 100-pc stream in the CMZ

exist (e.g. Sofue 1995; Molinari et al. 2011; Ridley et al. 2017).
However, out of all these models, the Kruijssen et al. (2015) model
provides the closest match to the position-position-velocity structure of the dust ridge (and the 100-pc stream in general, also see
Henshaw et al. 2016a), which motivates its use in this paper. Perhaps most importantly, many of the identified ways in which the
orbital dynamics affect cloud evolution are not sensitive to the details of the orbital solution, but are set by the global properties of
the gravitational potential. For instance, the sizes, aspect ratios, velocity dispersions, velocity gradients, and spin angular momenta
are all most strongly affected by the instantaneous tidal field and
shear, while carrying second-order imprints of the pericentre passage on the adopted orbital model. Therefore, we predict that many
of our findings should also persist in alternative orbital geometries
(e.g. Sormani et al. 2018).

4.2

Comparison to observed column densities and velocity
dispersions

We now briefly compare the properties of the simulated clouds to
those of the observed dust ridge clouds. The first of these comparisons is quantitative, as it considers the column densities and velocity dispersions as a function of position along the dust ridge as in
Figure 3 and Figure 4, mirroring the evolution with orbital time in
our simulations. The second comparison follows in Section 4.3 and
focuses on a single snapshot of our high-density simulations at the
position of the Brick.
For the first of the above two comparisons, we derive observed
column densities from the HiGAL cold dust map (Battersby et al. in
prep.; see the middle panel of Figure 2) and velocity dispersions
from the HNCO 4(0, 4) − 3(0, 3) data obtained with the Mopra
CMZ survey (Jones et al. 2012). Henshaw et al. (2016a) selected
this molecular line as their primary tracer of the gas kinematics,
because HNCO is widespread in the CMZ, suffers minimally from
self-absorption in high column density regions, and does not exhibit
hyperfine structure.14 Due to its widespread nature, it likely traces
the bulk of the gas in clouds (Jones et al. 2012), necessitating that
we include all gas present in the simulations, instead of imposing a
density cut as before. To ensure an appropriate comparison between
Note that the latter two points minimise any spurious broadening of the
spectral line profiles when fitting them with a Gaussian.

Specifically, we remove components with negative line-of-sight velocities relative to the local standard of rest, or velocities offset from the Kruijssen et al. (2015) orbit by more than 40 km s−1 . We also exclude components containing less than 25 per cent of the flux of the brightest component.

the column densities and velocity dispersions of observed and simulated clouds, we subject them to a highly analogous analysis. The
observations and simulations are first convolved to a common spatial resolution of 10 . The column densities are then evaluated at a
single {l, b} coordinate per cloud. For the simulations, we select
the coordinate with the highest column density within a 5 × 5 pc
area centred on the cloud centre of mass. For the observations, this
coordinate is taken to correspond to the cloud centre, which is identified by fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian to each cloud in the HiGAL column density map. The column densities are then obtained
directly from the simulated and observed maps, at the pixel closest to the the selected coordinate. The uncertainty on the observed
column densities is taken to be a factor of 2.
The velocity dispersions of the simulated clouds are measured
by calculating the mass-weighted line-of-sight velocity dispersion
within a square of 7.2 pc (i.e. 0.◦ 05) in width, again centred on
the cloud centre of mass. This averaging scale matches that over
which the observed velocity dispersions are extracted. When measuring the observed velocity dispersions, it is crucial to avoid contamination by the complex large-scale kinematic structure of the
CMZ, with multiple streams intersecting along the line of sight
(e.g. Kruijssen et al. 2015; Henshaw et al. 2016a). Therefore, we
fit the HNCO spectra across the entire CMZ obtained using the
spectral line fitting code SCOUSE (Henshaw et al. 2016a). For
these fits, we adopt a spectral averaging area with a width of 7.2 pc
(i.e. 0.◦ 05). We centre the spectral averaging areas on the cloud coordinates obtained above, reject velocity components unassociated
with the clouds,15 and calculate the intensity weighted average velocity dispersion of these components.
The middle panel of Figure 5 compares the observed column
densities in the Brick, clouds b, c, d, e, and f, Sgr B2, and Sgr B2+
to the total range spanned by the simulations (grey-shaded area) at
each Galactic longitude or time. Neither the observations nor the
simulations show any significant trends of increasing or decreasing column density with longitude (with the exception of the single
data point marking Sgr B2). For the simulations, we see that the total range spanned by the five different sets of initial conditions from
Table 1 is wider than the amplitude of any trend across the full longitude range (as in Figure 3). The absolute column densities found
in the simulations reproduce the observed range, with the exception
of Sgr B2. There are two possible reasons for this. Firstly, it may
indicate the superposition of several clouds along the line of sight
(as found in Section 2.2). Secondly, our high-density simulation
achieves an extreme star formation efficiency of nearly 90 per cent
near the position of Sgr B2. This is unphysical and results from
the absence of mechanisms that may slow down collapse and star
formation, such as stellar feedback and magnetic fields. Including
the mass locked in sink particles increases the upper envelope of
the grey-shaded area by a factor of 5–10, making it consistent with
Sgr B2. Therefore, we conclude that the high column density of
Sgr B2 should be addressed in future simulations employing a more
complete physical model.
In the bottom panel of Figure 5, we compare the observed velocity dispersions of the same set of clouds to the range covered in
our simulations, again as a function of Galactic longitude. The observed velocity dispersions fall within the total range of simulated

represent the observed properties of the dust ridge clouds, whereas the greyshaded area indicates the range spanned by the simulated clouds for the
five different initial conditions from Table 1. For the models, the column
densities and velocity dispersions are calculated differently from those in
Figure 3 and Figure 4 to facilitate an appropriate comparison to the observations (see the text). They are also averaged over a 0.3 Myr time window
to reduce stochasticity. This figure shows that most of the observed column
densities and velocity dispersions of dust ridge clouds are reproduced by
drawing from the range of cloud properties observed upstream and simulating their evolution. Only the column density of Sgr B2 exceeds the range

velocity dispersions. In addition, both the simulations and the observed clouds suggest a weak increase of σlos at l > 0.◦ 2, with Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients for the observed data
points of r ≈ 0.5. In the simulations, this is caused by a combination of (tidally-induced) gravitational collapse and shear (see Section 3.2.1). The generally good agreement at these longitudes contrasts with a slight (2–3 km s−1 ) underprediction of the observed
velocity dispersion of cloud c. It is plausible that the difference results from differences in the initial conditions. If true, this would
imply that cloud c had initial conditions similar to the high-density
and high-velocity dispersion simulations in Table 1, which exhibit
the highest velocity dispersions and define the upper bound on the
grey-shaded area in the bottom panel of Figure 5. However, two
important caveats are in order. Firstly, the observed velocity disperMNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

Structure and kinematics of Galactic Centre clouds
sions of CMZ clouds may vary by up to a factor of ∼ 2 depending
on the spectral line used, even if they have comparable critical excitation densities (e.g. Rathborne et al. 2015). With HNCO, we use
a tracer showing widespread emission in the CMZ that likely traces
most mass in clouds. It thus provides a good match to the simulations presented here, but it remains possible that other spectral
lines are more appropriate. Secondly, we reiterate that the presented
simulations capture a limited number of physical processes. The inclusion of additional physics, such as stellar feedback or chemistry,
may add further scatter and widen the predicted ranges represented
by the grey-shaded areas in Figure 5. We plan to address the influence of these processes in future work.

Comparison to ALMA observations of the Brick

We now turn to a qualitative comparison of the observed 3 mm
(89 GHz) dust continuum ALMA observations of the Brick (Rathborne et al. 2015) to the high-density simulation snapshot at the
position listed in Table 2, which provides the best match to the
Brick among the simulations and snapshots presented in this work.
To carry out this comparison, we generate a ‘simulated’ ALMA
observation using the CASA software package (McMullin et al.
2007), adopting the same setup with which the Brick was observed
by Rathborne et al. (2015). This is done using the simobserve
and simanalyze tasks in CASA. These tasks allow us to perform
synthetic ALMA observations of an input image by first simulating
the observation based on user-defined input parameters and subsequently generating a set of corresponding visibilities. These visibility data are then imaged using the clean task.
To prepare the simulated map, we first convert it from units of
M pc−2 to Jy. To do this, we assume a distance of d = 8.3 kpc
as in the rest of this paper, a dust temperature of T = 20 K, an
observing frequency of ν = 89 GHz, a gas-to-dust ratio of 100,
and an emissivity index of β = 1.75. The input parameters for
this simulated observation are based on those presented in Rathborne et al. (2015, ALMA project ID 2011.0.00217.S). We use
the buildConfigurationFile task to generate antenna configuration files from the measurement sets of the real data. The
data were taken across six execution blocks, each with varying
antenna configurations. To replicate the observations, we simulate
six separate observations, each corresponding to a different configuration. A mosaic of 7200 × 16200 with a central position of
{l, b} = {0.275, 0.030} is ‘observed’,16 with four spectral bands
set at 87.2, 89.1, 99.1, and 101.1 GHz, each with 1875 MHz bandwidth, thus providing a combined bandwidth of 7.5 GHz. Each execution is run for 40 minutes on-source and assumes a precipitable
water vapour of PWV = 1.5 mm.
Figure 6 shows the original column density map of the highdensity simulation at the position of the Brick, its simulated observation that has been generated with CASA according to the procedure above,17 and the dust continuum ALMA image of the real
Brick from Rathborne et al. (2015), all on the same (linear) intensity scale indicated by the colour bar. This comparison provides

15

several relevant insights. Firstly, the setup used to observe the Brick
with ALMA only recovers part of the flux and structure from the
simulation. Relative to the left-hand panel of Figure 6, the middle
panel especially misses emission near the edges of the field of view,
where the sensitivity drops. However, the brightest cores and filamentary structures are recovered well. A qualitative18 comparison
of these to the true Brick dust column density map in the right-hand
panel shows remarkable agreement. Other than the observed core
at {l, b} = {0.◦ 261, 0.◦ 016}, which is known to host a water maser
marking the onset of star formation and is saturated on the colour
scale of Figure 6 at 2.4 mJy arcsec−2 , the brightest cores in both
the simulated and real Brick are of the order 0.5 mJy arcsec−2 .
In addition, both maps show core sizes of 0.1–0.2 pc, connected
by pc-scale, flocculent filamentary structures. Globally, they also
follow a similar morphology, which manifests itself in the form of
comparable inclinations, aspect ratios, and curvature. In both maps,
the filamentary structures run along the major axis near the middle
of the cloud (which we attribute to the vertical tidal compression in
Section 2.2) and fan out to cover the full width of the cloud towards
its extremities in the top left and bottom right.
The above, cursory comparison of the simulated and real Brick
clouds will be followed up with a more detailed analysis in future
work. For instance, the size-linewidth relation, spatial and velocity power spectra, fractal dimension, and column density PDF are
ideally suited observables for a thorough, quantitative comparison
of these simulations to the observed CMZ clouds. In particular, an
ALMA Large Programme covering the entire CMZ with a spatial
resolution, sensitivity, and spectral setup as in Figure 6 is both observationally feasible and would enable systematic comparisons of
these quantities as a function of (orbital) position to the simulations.

Predictions for future observational tests

Throughout this paper, we have drawn a direct comparison between
the simulated clouds and observations of real CMZ clouds. This
comparison shows that the presented simulations quantitatively reproduce a surprising variety of properties of the observed dust
ridge clouds, from their column densities and velocity dispersions
(Section 4.2) to the velocity gradient (Section 3.2.2) and spatiallyresolved structure (Section 4.3) of the Brick. These results add to
the qualitative discussion of a much wider variety of observables
in Section 2.2 and justify the use of these simulations as interpretative tools for constraining which physical mechanisms govern the
baryon cycle in the CMZ. The quantitative character of these simulations opens up a variety of future observational tests of the physical predictions and hypotheses put forward in this work. Here, we
focus on predictions of our models that would benefit from additional observational follow-up work. In addition, we discuss how
broadly the predictions of our models should apply.
In principle, the physical processes modelled in this work
should apply generally. We have adopted initial conditions representative of the clouds some 0.75 Myr upstream of the dust ridge,
situated on the other side of the preceding pericentre passage, at
negative Galactic longitudes and positive Galactic latitudes (cf.

16

Because the simulated cloud is lopsided (see Figure 2), the central coordinates are offset from the centre of the Brick by 0.◦ 026. That way, the field
of view is focused on where most of the mass resides in the simulation.
17 For consistency with most of the analysis presented in this work, we
have used the same density threshold of ρ > 104 cm−3 to produce the images of the simulation. Material at lower densities is unlikely to contribute
strongly to the ALMA maps, because emission on large angular scales is
filtered out by the interferometer.
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

18

We reiterate that a one-to-one, absolute comparison between the simulated and observed maps is not meaningful, because the precise structure of
the simulated map depends entirely on the specific realisation of the simulation’s initial conditions. Even between identical realisations of the initial
conditions, differences will develop during the simulation due to microscale chaos and stochasticity (e.g. Keller et al. 2019).

of the simulated cloud are similar to those of the observed Brick.

Henshaw et al. 2016b). Based on their relatively low densities relative to other CMZ clouds, these clouds are assumed to have recently
condensed out of the diffuse medium, possibly due to their recent
arrival on the 100-pc stream. If the progenitors to other dense, dust
ridge-like gas structures have similar properties, we would expect
that these sequences of dense gas clouds also follow the behaviour
found in our simulations. In this context, specific targets of interest
could be the 20 and 50 km s−1 clouds. These clouds are passing
through pericentre at a radius of r = 60–70 pc (Kruijssen et al.
2015), represent the high-density end of a part of the 100-pc stream
that starts more diffusely near Sgr C, and exhibit signs of star formation (e.g. Ho et al. 1985; Mills et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2015, 2017).
It is quite plausible that the morphological and kinematic trends
with longitude identified in this work are found not only in the dust
ridge, but at least qualitatively also in the 20 and 50 km s−1 clouds.
We emphasise that the trends with Galactic longitude (or
equivalently with time relative to accretion or pericentre passage)
predicted by Figure 3 and Figure 4 are not necessarily monotonic.
The range of initial conditions was chosen to represent a reasonable
range based on the plausible precursor clouds to the dust ridge. As
such, the spread between the model curves in Figure 3 and Figure 4 provides an uncertainty range. For some quantities (e.g. the
column density and velocity dispersion, see Section 4.2), this range
exceeds the total magnitude of the trend, implying that even opposite trends may be observed if the initial conditions of the clouds
vary systematically with longitude. Notwithstanding this caveat,
we do predict a weak, but measurable trend of increasing velocity dispersions towards the highest longitudes, which is tentatively
confirmed by the observations shown in Figure 5 (also see Krieger
et al. 2017). Other quantities (e.g. the aspect ratio and spin angular momentum) exhibit well-defined trends that represent firm predictions of this work. A systematic study of the presented observables as a function of position along the 100-pc stream should allow
recently-condensed sequences of clouds to be identified. These sequences may cover any range of evolutionary phases between the
initial condensation out of the diffuse medium and their eventual
disruption by stellar feedback. However, the finite lengths of such
correlated segments mean they are unlikely to span the complete
evolutionary timeline at a single moment in time. Correlating the
occurrence of these sequences with pericentre passages will show
whether the eccentricity of the orbit plays a defining role in reg-

ulating cloud morphology in kinematics or, as expected based on
these simulations, plays a relevant yet sub-dominant role next to
the presence of the external gravitational potential.
Finally, the advent of ALMA now enables extragalactic CMZs
to be observed at a sensitivity and spatial resolution similar to those
obtained of the Galactic CMZ in the pre-ALMA era. Provided that
the gravitational potential, as parameterised through the power law
slope of the enclosed mass profile, and the orbital eccentricity of the
gas streams in such CMZs are similar to those adopted here, our
predictions should apply directly to these systems too. Discussed
observables that may feasibly be obtained in face-on CMZs are the
clouds’ longitudinal extents (δx) and velocity dispersions (σlos , under the assumption that the trends with longitude are stronger than
the deviations from velocity isotropy). In addition, galaxies with
low inclinations provide a unique opportunity to quantify the extents of clouds in the galactic plane, which we predict to be substantial. The predictions for the cloud aspect ratios, column densities, and velocity gradients are specific to observations through the
orbital plane. Highly-inclined, edge-on galaxies such as NGC 253
(e.g. Sakamoto et al. 2011) would enable a comparison to these
observables, in addition to the clouds’ longitudinal extents and velocity dispersions.
Above all, the simulations presented in this paper constitute a
rich data set that can be used to shed light on a wide range of open
questions. While we have considered several key quantities and observables here, future work will extend our analysis to e.g. the star
formation efficiencies, virial parameters, and size-linewidth relations. Together with its companion paper (Dale et al. 2019), the
present work sets the first step towards an in-depth physical understanding of the close interaction between galactic dynamics, cloud
evolution, and star formation, both in the CMZ of the Milky Way
and in extragalactic centres.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

We have presented a set of five numerical simulations of gas clouds
orbiting on the 100-pc stream of the CMZ, spanning a representative range of initial conditions, with the goal of characterising their
morphological and kinematic evolution in response to the external

gravitational potential and their passage through pericentre.19 This
represents the first set of numerical simulations specifically aimed
at modelling the clouds in the CMZ dust ridge, thus enabling direct
comparisons to observations. Indeed, we find that the inclusion of
the background potential and the orbital motion allow our models
to reproduce several key features of the observed CMZ clouds. The
main results of this work are as follows.
Background potential: The presence of a background potential
and the clouds’ motion through pericentre represent a transformational event, affecting several of the cloud properties. The potential
generates a fully compressive tidal field in the galactocentric radius
range 45 < r/pc < 115, most strongly so in the vertical direction, and also imposes a significant amount of shear. The pericentre
passage increases the strengths of both these effects by several tens
of per cent. Additionally, the motion from apocentre towards pericentre on an eccentric orbit causes a geometric compression perpendicular to the direction of motion due to the convergence of the
orbital trajectories, as well as a geometric extension along the orbit
due to differential acceleration.
Global morphology: The combination of the compressive tidal
field and geometric convergence towards pericentre causes the
clouds to be compressed vertically, leading to a factor 2 decrease of
their vertical extent. In addition, the presence of shear and differential acceleration along the orbit stretches the clouds in the Galactic
longitude direction by up to a factor of 2. Together, these effects
turn the clouds into pancake-like structures, reaching an extreme
aspect ratio of δz/δx = 0.25 between pericentre and the position
of the Brick, after which the aspect ratio gradually returns to unity
by the position of Sgr B2. These galactic-dynamical deformations
affect the simulated clouds down to the scales below which selfgravity dominates, causing them to dynamically decouple from the
background potential. Quantitatively, the decoupling scale varies
with the cloud density.
Column densities: Due to the vertical compression, the (massweighted) column densities of the simulated clouds reach a local
maximum at the position of the Brick. The global column density subsequently briefly decreases, but the densities of individual
sub-clumps proceed to increase as the clouds emerge from the bottom of the potential at pericentre and gravitational collapse sets
in. The curvature of the orbit away from the observer projects the
azimuthally-stretched clouds along the line of sight, driving up the
column density. However, the combined magnitude of these evolutionary trends is smaller than the range of column densities encompassed by our suite of simulations, which were chosen to be
representative of the gas upstream from the dust ridge. Therefore,
column density variations among the dust ridge clouds primarily
trace variations in their initial conditions. We also find that the observed rise of the global column density towards high Galactic longitudes at the Sgr B2 complex indicates the superposition of multiple clouds along the line of sight.
Spatial structure: As the clouds orbit the Galactic Centre, their
central regions fragment and undergo local gravitational collapse,
whereas their outer layers disperse under the influence of shear.
This causes the clouds to develop flocculent filamentary structures
oriented perpendicularly to the vertical compression, and form
10 pc-scale extensions pointing towards the observer. Due to the
19

A detailed discussion of the simulations is presented in a companion
paper (Dale et al. 2019), in which we also discuss the general properties of
clouds orbiting in external potentials and investigate how the background
potential affects the star formation activity of the orbiting clouds.

torque experienced by the clouds as they pass through pericentre,
these extensions are offset towards high Galactic longitudes and
latitudes, resulting in clouds that appear inclined in the plane of
the sky. Some of these extensions are (partially) accreted by the
cloud centres over time, causing them to grow in mass. This more
strongly affects the higher-density clouds.
Kinematics and dynamics: The kinematics of the clouds are
driven by a combination of shear and gravitational collapse due
to the compressive tidal field. The dissipation of the initial turbulent energy and the corresponding decrease of the line-of-sight
velocity dispersion are slowed down by shear-generated motions.
These motions cause the clouds to counter-rotate relative to the
orbital motion, turning them into spinning pancakes with velocity
gradients opposite to the orbital rotation. Eventually, gravitational
collapse sets in and causes the velocity dispersions to increase.
Our models make a strong prediction that the velocity dispersion
should increase steeply with longitude between 0.◦ 5 6 l 6 0.◦ 8.
As the orbit curves off at high longitudes, the superposition of
clouds along the line of sight leads to extreme kinematic complexity, with large numbers of velocity components. Another consequence of the collapse is that the clouds’ velocity gradients increase
in strength between pericentre passage and the position of Sgr B2
due to the collapse-driven increase of their angular velocity. The
clouds’ spin angular momenta are not conserved during this collapse. They reach a peak value at the position of the Brick due to
the preceding pericentre passage, but decrease during collapse due
to tidal shear-driven torques from the background potential.
Comparison to observations: The above quantities and their
evolution naturally explain a number of key observations of CMZ
clouds. Below, we list the main ones, indicate the responsible
mechanisms in parentheses, and provide key observational references where appropriate. The simulations reproduce the Brick’s
high column density (compressive tidal field and pericentre passage, cf. Longmore et al. 2012), its velocity gradient opposite to the
orbital rotation (shear, enhanced by collapse due to the compressive tidal field, cf. Rathborne et al. 2014a; Federrath et al. 2016),
its flattened morphology (compressive tidal field and geometric deformation during pericentre passage, cf. Lis & Menten 1998), its
inclination in the plane of the sky (torque during pericentre passage), its expanding outer layers (shear, cf. Rathborne et al. 2014a),
and its filamentary structure along its major axis (compressive tidal
field, cf. Rathborne et al. 2015; also seen in clouds b, d, and e by
Walker et al. 2018). They also reproduce the evolution along the
dust ridge of the clouds’ inclination angles (torque during pericentre passage), as well as the increase of the velocity dispersion along
the dust ridge towards Sgr B2 (compressive tidal field and shear,
cf. Henshaw et al. 2016a), the increased kinematic complexity of
the Sgr B2 complex (shear and orbital curvature, cf. Mehringer
et al. 1993), and the range of cloud column densities found along
the dust ridge (initial conditions, compressive tidal field, shear, orbital curvature, and pericentre passage, cf. Battersby et al. in prep.).
Taken together, the reproduction of such a wide range of observables strongly suggests that the dynamical ingredients of the presented models are critical for understanding the properties, formation, and evolution of the CMZ clouds.
Background potential vs. pericentre passage: Dale et al. (2019)
compare the simulations discussed here to a set of control experiments of clouds on a circular orbit within the same gravitational
potential (thus ‘switching off’ the pericentre passage), as well as
of clouds in complete isolation. We provide analogues to Figure 3
and Figure 4 for the circular control runs in Appendix A, but refer
to Dale et al. (2019) for further details and summarise the con-

18

clusions relevant to the results of this work here. We find that the
presence of the background potential is the main factor in setting
the behaviour of most of the observables discussed above. The potential generates shear and shapes the tidal field, thereby setting the
cloud radii, aspect ratios, the onset of gravitational collapse and the
corresponding rise of the column densities, velocity dispersions,
velocity gradients, and absolute spin angular momenta. However,
the pericentre passage accelerates the evolution of all of the above
observables by 0.1–0.3 Myr and additionally drives the temporary
decrease of the column densities downstream from the Brick due
to post-pericentre expansion, as well as the rise of the spin angular momenta just after pericentre. The extent to which these effects
manifest themselves in practice depends on the timing of pericentre
passage relative to cloud condensation or accretion (see below).
Collapse triggered by pericentre passage: As a result of the
above comparison between the background potential and the pericentre passage, we find that the pericentre passage may act as a
trigger for collapse (and possibly star formation) if the gas enters the 100-pc stream (either by accretion or by condensing out of
the diffuse medium) less than one free-fall time before pericentre
(i.e. ∆t . 0.5 Myr or ∆l . 0.◦ 5 for the gas upstream from the dust
ridge, see Henshaw et al. 2016b). This can manifest itself as an evolutionary progression of clouds as a function of Galactic longitude
downstream from pericentre. However, if the gas enters the stream
earlier, it may collapse without the aid of the ‘nudge’ provided by
the pericentre passage, thus interrupting any evolutionary sequence.
Note that the apocentre radius of the Kruijssen et al. (2015) orbit
(ra = 120 pc) lies on the outer edge of the compressive region
(45 < r/pc < 115), which implies that clouds orbiting on the
gas stream may alternate between mildly extensive and strongly
compressive tidal fields. Given the time difference between apocentre and pericentre of ∆t = 1 Myr, any self-gravitating gas with
volume densities ρ . 103 cm−3 (corresponding to free-fall times
tff & 1.1 Myr) will thus undergo collapse triggered by the pericentre passage. For higher-density gas, this depends on the time of
cloud condensation or its accretion onto the 100-pc stream relative
to pericentre.
Collapse triggered by accretion onto the 100-pc stream: We
find that the strong influence of the compressive tidal field causes
major changes to the evolution of clouds orbiting in the CMZ
potential. Any gas flows that enter the compressive region at
45 < r/pc < 115 will be subject to the sudden presence of a
fully compressive tidal field and are therefore likely to follow the
evolutionary streamline identified in this paper. The subsequent
evolution of the condensing clouds should follow the general
predictions made by our simulations. This means that evolutionary
sequences of CMZ clouds may follow from a preceding pericentre
passage if the timing is right, but are not restricted to such
‘hotspots’. Instead, any evolutionary progression found among
segments of the 100-pc stream may be used to infer sites of cloud
condensation or accretion upstream from such segments and can
plausibly be translated into an absolute timeline by using the simulations presented here. This channel for collapse is most important
for clouds that condense or accrete onto the 100-pc stream more
than a free-fall time before the next pericentre passage. We thus
expect evolutionary sequences along the 100-pc stream to appear
segmented, with a fraction of them being triggered by pericentre
passage and another fraction being triggered by entering the stream.
General implications: The results presented in this paper reveal
that the evolution of molecular clouds near galactic centres is
closely coupled to their orbital dynamics. As galactic rotation
curves must turn over at small radii, such that v ∝ r(α−1)/2 ≡ rβ

with α > 2 and β > 1/2, a fully compressive tidal field is
predicted to be present in most galactic centres. As a result, the
accretion of gas onto these galactic centres will be accompanied
by transformative dynamical changes to the clouds, which likely
lead to their collapse and associated star formation. During their
subsequent evolution, the clouds are shaped by high levels of
shear, as well as tidal and geometric deformation. Together, these
processes naturally give rise to the starbursts observed in numerous
galactic nuclei (e.g. Jogee et al. 2005; Davies et al. 2007; Leroy
et al. 2013, also see Krumholz & Kruijssen 2015; Krumholz et al.
2017; Torrey et al. 2017).
By zooming in on individual, simulated clouds that orbit in a realistic gravitational potential of a galactic nucleus, we have identified
several key physical processes that govern the lifecycle of gas and
star formation in such nuclei. It is not unlikely that these mechanisms set important bottlenecks (or avenues) for gas accretion onto
supermassive black holes, thus affecting the large-scale evolution
of the host galaxy. For instance, the tidally-induced, efficient circumnuclear star formation may represent an important accretion
bottleneck and explain why there is no correlation between supermassive black hole growth and the presence of galactic bars (e.g.
Goulding et al. 2017). In the future, it will be beneficial to expand
our models to a broader range of spatial scales and observables,
to further increase their predictive power and facilitate additional,
direct comparisons to the Galactic CMZ and extragalactic nuclei.

APPENDIX A: STRUCTURAL AND KINEMATIC
EVOLUTION IN THE CIRCULAR CONTROL RUNS
For reference, Figure A1 and Figure A2 quantify the evolution of
the simulated clouds on circular orbits, analogously to Figure 3 and
Figure 4, respectively. We have chosen the radius of these circular
orbits to match the initial galactocentric radius of the clouds on eccentric orbits, i.e. r = 90 pc (Dale et al. 2019). This radius represents the mean galactocentric radius of the eccentric orbits (which
range from r = 60 pc to r = 120 pc) and also provides a close
match to their time-averaged radius (r = 97.3 pc). It thus represents the tidal environment in which the clouds on eccentric orbits spend most of their time. Overall, the main difference between
clouds evolving on these orbits is that the pericentre passage of the
eccentric orbit accelerates cloud evolution by 0.1–0.3 Myr relative
to clouds on circular orbits. See Section 3 for further details.
