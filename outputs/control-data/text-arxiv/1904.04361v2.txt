Sensing vector magnetic fields is critical to many applications in fundamental physics, bioimaging,
and material science. Magnetic-field sensors exploiting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are particularly compelling as they offer high sensitivity and spatial resolution even at nanoscale. Achieving vector magnetometry has, however, often required applying microwaves sequentially or simultaneously,
limiting the sensors’ applications under cryogenic temperature. Here we propose and demonstrate
a microwave-free vector magnetometer that simultaneously measures all Cartesian components of
a magnetic field using NV ensembles in diamond. In particular, the present magnetometer leverages the level anticrossing in the triplet ground state at 102.4 mT, allowing the measurement of
both longitudinal and transverse fields with a wide bandwidth from zero to megahertz range. Full
vector sensing capability is proffered by modulating fields along the preferential NV axis and in
the transverse plane and subsequent
demodulation of the signal. This sensor exhibits a root mean
√
square noise floor of ≈ 300 pT / Hz in all directions. The present technique is broadly applicable
to both ensemble sensors and potentially also single-NV sensors, extending the vector capability to
nanoscale measurement under ambient temperatures.

INTRODUCTION

Sensitive vector magnetometers are exploited in applications including magnetic navigation [1], magnetic
anomaly detection [2], current and position sensing [2],
and measuring biological magnetic fields [3, 4]. Several
versatile magnetometry platforms have emerged over the
past decades, such as Hall probes, flux-gate, tunnelingmagnetoresistance [5], superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) based magnetometry [6] and vapor cell based magnetometry [7, 8]. Particularly compelling are sensors based on negatively charged nitrogenvacancy (NV) centers in single-crystal diamond, providing high-sensitivity magnetic sensing and high-resolution
imaging [9–11]. There is growing interest in magneticfield sensors with high spatial resolution, for example
to study biological processes or the composition of materials. Utilizing NV centers for magnetometry allows
measuring magnetic fields at ambient temperature and
microscopic scales, providing new tools for probing vari-

ous phenomena including magnetism in condensed matter systems [12], semiconductor materials [13] and metallic compounds [14], and elucidating spin order in magnetic materials [15].
To date, diamond-based vector magnetometers have
been realized by interrogating ensembles of NV centers
along multiple crystallographic axes [16, 17] or relying on
a hybrid magnetometry platform consisting of an electronic NV sensor and a nuclear spin qubit at particular positions [18]. These techniques, however, are all
based on using the optically detected magnetic resonance
(ODMR) technique with the requirement of applying microwaves sequentially or simultaneously [16, 17, 19]. The
requirement of microwave control brings the possibility
of spurious harmonics within the measurement and hinders applications in areas where it is inherently difficult
to achieve such control or where the application of microwaves is prohibitively invasive. Although NV-based
sensors have been successfully implemented as vector
magnetic probes at room temperature, it has remained
an outstanding challenge to extend the vector capability
to cryogenic temperatures (less than 4 K) due to difficulties of thermal management. The heat from the applied
microwaves is unavoidable and causes temperature variations, restricting the sensors for numerous innovative

2
applications, such as mapping the magnetization of individual atomic layers of van der Waals materials [20].
We propose and demonstrate a protocol that enables
vectorial measurement of magnetic fields by interrogating an ensemble of NV centers aligned along only a single crystallographic axis (we do not use a preferentialorientation NV-diamond sample) at the ground-state
level anticrossing (GSLAC). By applying two orthogonal
alternating fields, along and perpendicular to the chosen
axis, our technique offers direct and simultaneous readout of all three magnetic components, free from systematic errors during reconstruction. In contrast to existing
methods, our approach does not employ microwave fields.
Thus it is possible to extend NV-based vector magnetic
sensing techniques to cryogenic temperatures, representing an important advance in magnetometry.
The method can be potentially extended to single-NV
probes. This will facilitate extraction of complete vector
information of the magnetic field to be measured with
nanoscale spatial resolution under ambient temperatures.
A nanoscale vector magnetometer would bring a wealth
of additional information and is motivated by numerous
applications, e.g., noninvasive tracking of particle motion
in intracellular medium [21, 22] and discerning the directionality of action-potential firing [18]. The single-NV
vector magnetic-field probe, in some cases, can address
the problem of microscopic characterization of novel spin
textures [23], which, in the absence of vector information,
would rely on system-dependent assumptions, artificially
restricting the manifold of solutions compatible with experimental results.

II.

MAGNETOMETRY METHOD

This microwave-free technique for magnetic sensing
is based on detecting changes in NV-photoluminescence
(PL) under optical pumping near the GSLAC. It was
proposed and demonstrated for sensing the longitudinal component of a magnetic field in Wickenbrock et al.
[27] and non-quantitatively indicating a transverse component by T1 relaxometry detection [28]. As both the
longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields can lead to
a change in the PL signal at the GSLAC and the response to the direction of the transverse component is
highly non-trivial [29, 30], achieving vectorial sensing of
magnetic fields with a single NV center or an ensembles
along a single crystallographic axis faces a number of significant challenges.
In the following, we address the challenges of measuring all Cartesian components simultaneously and precisely. The NV center is an atomic-scale defect consisting
of a substitutional nitrogen adjacent to a vacancy in the
diamond lattice. It has a spin-triplet ground state (S=1),
which can be optically polarized to |ms = 0i and read
out due to a spin-dependent intersystem crossing into an
intermediate singlet state. Without magnetic field the
|ms = ±1i states are (nearly) degenerate; however, owing

to spin-spin interaction, these states lie higher in energy
than the |ms = 0i state. This is the so-called zero-field
splitting D between the magnetic sublevels corresponding to a frequency difference of 2.87 GHz. Brought to
degeneracy via the Zeeman effect, a subset of NV centers’ magnetic sublevels experience a complex GSLAC at
an axial field Bz ≈ 102.4 mT [27, 28]. Figure 1 (a) shows
the energy levels of the NV center as a function of an
applied magnetic field including the coupling to the intrinsic nuclear spin of nitrogen (I=1).
Figure 1 (b) shows the PL signal as a function of the
axial magnetic field with zero transverse fields. A remarkably sharp feature around 102.4 mT, zoomed-in in
the inset, indicates the GSLAC. In the inset, several additional features are visible which can be attributed to
cross-relaxation with the nearby spin bath [25, 27, 31, 32].
A detailed study of these features is currently being conducted and will be presented in a separate manuscript.
Transverse fields couple the |ms = 0i and |ms = −1i
magnetic sublevel manifold and therefore affect contrast
and amplitude of the GSLAC feature. Traces of the
GSLAC feature for several transverse fields in the range
of ±0.06 mT, are depicted in Fig. 1 (c). The amplitudes
of the GSLAC feature as a function of transverse field is
indicated by the trace-colored dots and connected with
the black line. In summary, the GSLAC contrast exhibits
a relatively narrow (FWHM≈ 38 µT) magnetic resonance
feature as a function of transverse magnetic field centered
around zero transverse field.
In order to describe the vector sensing mechanism, we
first analyze the Hamiltonian of the triplet ground state
around the GSLAC. The system can be modelled by only
considering |ms = 0i and |ms = −1i. The |ms = +1i is
ignored in the following because it is at a much higher
energy than the |ms = 0i state which is preferentially
populated under optical excitation [29]. With the hyperfine interaction between the NV electron spin and the
nuclear spin of the intrinsic nitrogen atom (for details
see [33]), the Hamiltonian is expressed in the basis of
{ms , mI }. Here we write a two-level Hamiltonian in the
subspace {|0, +1i, |−1, +1i} since the spins are efficiently
polarized to the |0, 1i state for a 14 N-V center [28] under
optical excitation. For a given NV center, we define the
z-axis along the symmetry axis of the center. In the presence of an arbitrary magnetic field B = (Bx , By , Bz ) and
neglecting the nuclear Zeeman shift, the reduced Hamiltonian is given by

and γe is the electron gyromagnetic ratio. In the absence
of transverse fields, the |0, +1i state does not mix with
any other states [see Fig. 1 (a)]. Therefore, if the center is
fully polarized to this state, the PL should not depend on

the exact value of the longitudinal magnetic field. However, in the presence of the spin bath producing randomly
fluctuating magnetic fields, there arises an effective coupling between the eigenstates resulting in depolarization
of the NV center and a corresponding drop in PL near
the level crossings.
We introduce the axial field difference from the crossing, γe δBz = D − γe Bz . If |δBz |  |B⊥ |, far from
the avoided crossing region, the PL is insensitive to the
transverse field. Conversely, if |B⊥ |  |δBz |, the signal becomes insensitive to small changes in the longitudinal field. In other words, near the GSLAC, the PL
can be used to determine the transverse and longitudinal components of the magnetic field to be measured.
This magnetic-vector sensing protocol can be extended to
single-NV probes, and therefore, nanoscale sensing volume, since it just relies on intrinsic properties of the NV
center and the presence of a spin bath.
Based on the Hamiltonian (Eq. 1) and the assumption
of an isotropic spin bath, we expect that the effect of a
transverse magnetic field on the intensity of PL should
not depend on the direction of the transverse field. In

fact, we observe this experimentally, see Fig. 2 (b). The
PL, however, does depend on the magnitude of the applied transverse field. Therefore, we have a sensor for
the magnitude of the transverse field. Similar to how
it is possible to measure the field vector with a scalar
magnetometer by applying modulated fields in different
directions, it is also possible, as we demonstrate here,
to measure both Cartesian components of the transverse
field with our sensor.
A typical method to adapt a scalar magnetometer
for vector measurement is to apply mutually orthogonal
fields modulated at different frequencies. Thus it is possible to determine the components along each direction by
individually demodulating the signal [8]. In this work we
propose a method to realize vector-field sensing in the
x-y plane using a transverse field rotating around the
z-axis [Fig. 2 (a)] with just one frequency. To gain an intuitive understanding, we approximate the PL lineshape
as a function of transverse magnetic fields with a 2-D
Lorentzian centered around Bx = By = 0, Fig. 3 (a) (i).
With a transverse field applied that is rotating around
z, the PL signal will be reduced but remains unmodu-

in all directions. Note here, that the reference phase of
the LIA for the transverse-field signal demodulation sets
the coordinate axes in the x-y plane while the phase for
z-axis demodulation is tuned to maximize the amplitude
of the response signal.

FIG. 2. (a) Experimental setup for the microwave-free magnetometer and the set Cartesian coordinate system. The diamond is placed in the center of a 3-D Helmholtz coil pairs. A
static magnetic field (Bs ) is applied along a NV axis (noted as
z direction) by a customized electromagnet. The static magnetic field, modulating fields (Bmz along z and Bmt in the
transverse plane)and the axis of NV centers in the NV frame
coordinate system are displayed. The measured magnitude

lated, indicated by the red curve in Fig. 3 (a) (ii). In the
presence of an additional static transverse field, the PL
signal shows a modulation at the rotation frequency with
a minimum when the rotating field points in the same direction as the field under interrogation and a maximum
when both are antiparallel, shown in Fig. 3 (a) (iii), (iv)
and (v). The difference between the PL signals with (red
curve) and without (blue curve) applied transverse field is
shown in Fig. 3 (b). This is then demodulated by a Lockin amplifier (LIA) which delivers the information of both
the amplitude and the angle of the magnetic field to be
measured, as shown in Fig. 3 (c). The reference phase of
the LIA was set so that a magnetic field along the x-axis
corresponds to phase zero (and negative amplitude). The
LIA output shows a maximum value at 0o when applying
a field along x-axis, shown in Fig. 3 (c). An applied field
in any other direction leads to an oscillating PL signal
with a corresponding phase. Therefore, the phase output of the LIA is the angle between the transverse field
to be measured and the defined x and y axes.
In addition to the longitudinal magnetic field measurement [27], all Cartesian magnetic-field components can

The experimental apparatus includes a custom-built
electromagnet and three pairs of orthogonal Helmholtz
coils wound on a 3-D printed mount. The electromagnet
can be moved with a computer-controlled 3-D translation
stage (Thorlabs PT3-Z8) and a rotation stage (Thorlabs
NR360S, x-axis). The NV-diamond sensor is placed in
the center of both the magnetic bore and three pairs of
integrated orthogonal Helmholtz coils. The diamond can
be rotated around the z-axis. This provides all degrees
of the necessary freedom for placing the diamond in the
center of the magnet and aligning the NV axis parallel
to the magnetic field.
A two-channel function generator (Tektronix AFG
3022A) provides sinusoidal signals for field modulations
in the longitudinal and transverse directions and references for the demodulation by two LIAs. The signal
from one of the channels is split in two with one of them
passing through a phase shifter. These two signals with
the same frequency but 90-degree-shifted relative phase
are applied to two pairs of the Helmholtz coils (along
the x and y axes). All three signals are amplified via
a homemade 3-channel current amplifier before reaching
the Helmholtz coils.
The light source is a solid-state laser emitting at a
wavelength λ = 532 nm (laser Quantum Gem 532). The
PL emitted by the diamond sample is collected with a
parabolic lens and detected with a photodetector (Thorlabs PDA 36A).
The sensor is a 99.97% 12 C, (111)-cut diamond single
crystal, with dimensions 0.71 mm × 0.69 mm and a thickness 0.43 mm. It was laser-cut from a 12 C-enriched diamond single crystal grown by the temperature gradient
method at high pressure (6.1 GPa) and high temperature
(1430o C). A metal solvent containing a nitrogen-getter
and carbon powder prepared by pylolysis of 99.97% 12 Cenriched methane as a carbon source were used [34]. It
was irradiated with 2 MeV electrons from a CockcroftWalton accelerator to a total fluence of 1.8 × 1018 cm−2
at room temperature, and annealed at 800o C for 5 hours.
This source diamond was reported to have 3-ppm initial
nitrogen and 0.9-ppm NV− after conversion, measured
by electron paramagnetic resonance techniques [35]. This
diamond provides remarkable narrow GSLAC-features
with small residual couplings to 13 C nuclear spins which
is essential for the sensitivity of the proposed method.
The Helmholtz coil pairs for the field modulation can
also be used to calibrate the response to AC and DC
magnetic fields B = (Bx , By , Bz ). The applied fields, in

the range of ±4 µT along each direction, are calibrated
by flux gate magnetometers and consistent with a priori calculations from the known coil geometry and the
applied currents. The single-frequency-modulation 2-D
vector magnetometry method is demonstrated by mapping the amplitudes and phase of the LIA output as a
function of the applied fields in the x-y plane, see Fig. 2
(b) and (c). We also infer the field direction in x-z plane
from measurements of the ratio Bz /Bx , see Fig. 4.

with a different frequency (than the one in the transverse direction) and the corresponding demodulation of
the PL signal. A matrix of 2-D vector magnetic fields in
the x-z plane was measured to demonstrate this method.
The angle of the field can be calculated as arctan(Bz /Bx )
from the applied currents and calibration factors of the
two coils. Figure 4 shows that the ratios of the measured
fields Bz and Bx correspond to different angles following
the expected arctangent curve.

rections (z and x) as well as possible cross-talk effects
were evaluated. Derivatives of the fluorescence signals in
Fig. 1 (b), detected in the properly phased LIA X output
while applying sinusoidally modulating fields along z-axis
or x-axis in the presence of a static field along z-axis, are
shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b). The modulation frequencies
were 3.7 kHz and 2.3 kHz, respectively, and the modulation depth ≈20 µT. Pronounced magnetically dependent
features around the GSLAC were detected. In the case of
z-axis modulation, the resulting demodulated PL signal
depends linearly on the magnetic field in the region near
the GSLAC [Fig. 5 (a)], while it is first-order insensitive
to the z-axis magnetic field when applying modulation
along the x-axis, [Fig. 5 (b)]. This demonstrates the absence of crosstalk between the different modulating fields
in the proximity of the GSLAC. At a longitudinal field
corresponding to the GSLAC and with an applied x-axis
modulation the demodulated PL signal shows a linear
dependence on the x-axis magnetic field [see Fig. 5 (c)].
Figures 5 (d) and (e) show the single channel magnetic
sensitivity along the z and x axes, respectively. These
are calibrated by linearly fitting the data near the zerocrossing of the corresponding derivative curves [Fig. 5 (a)
and (c)] and the slope of this line is used to translate the
LIA output signal to magnetic field. For noise measurements, the LIA output is recorded for 1 s while the background magnetic field is set to a point where the LIA
X is zero. The data are fast-Fourier transformed and
show noise floor in different configurations [see Fig. 5 (d)
and (e)], and thus the sensitivity, for a given bandwidth.
Despite the dominant 1/f noise (near an order of magnitude higher in the longitudinal direction presumably
due to the power supply of the electromagnet),
the de√
vice exhibits a noise floor of around 300 pT/ Hz in both
the longitudinal direction and the measured transverse
direction. The noise for the magnetically insensitive configuration in both cases was measured at magnetic fields
of 0.2 mT off
√the GSLAC field. The electronic noise floor
(≈ 100 pT/ Hz) was measured by turning off the green
excitation light and acquiring the output of the LIA.
The photon shot noise limit for the two measurements

√
√
is 65 pT/ Hz and 60 pT/ Hz, respectively, which are
calculated based upon the number of incident photons at
the photodetector, the contrast and width of the magnetically sensitive feature in the GSLAC spectral response.
The overall noise is dominated by environmental noise.
The noise can be further suppressed deploying a differential detection schemes [35].
As a demonstration of full-vector sensing capacity, a
set of static magnetic field vectors, the trajectory of
which was designed along a 3-D a spiral curve on a sphere,
was applied and measured. The applied field value curve
is shown in Fig. 6 (a) and the corresponding amplitudes
along each coordinate axis are displayed in Fig. 6 (b). The
component in z direction is |B| cos θ, where |B| is the
magnitude of the applied magnetic field vectors and θ is
the altitude angle (between the magnetic field to be measured and the z-axis). The Bx and By are |B| sin θ cos φ
and |B| sin θ sin φ, respectively, where φ is the azimuth
angle (between the projection of B in the x-y plane and
the x-axis). This corresponds to the values of Bx and By
shown in Fig. 6 (b). The measured field components in
x and y directions show good agreement with the amplitudes determined by a priori calculations. The scatter in
the data can be attributed to environmental noise in the
laboratory and the applied field. The trajectory was measured multiple times and the angles were reconstructed
every time. Figure 6 (c) shows the average angle with
the statistical error. Note here, that all the experiments
were performed in a lab environment without magnetic
shielding.
With the basic protocol established, this simultaneous vector magnetometry method should be extendable
to single-NV probes. Single NV centers in diamond
have been exploited to detect fluctuating magnetic fields
(used as scalar relaxometry magnetometers) without microwaves [28, 36] as they share the spin dynamics near the
GSLAC investigated above and in literature [28]. Both
techniques, the presently realized GSLAC-based vector
magnetometry and relaxometry magnetometry, rely on
monitoring the PL signal when the NVs are precisely
turned to/near the GSLAC. Since they are operated with
similar apparatus, the experimental setup for the latter
can be extended for vector magnetic sensing by adding a
set of 3-D Helmholtz coil pairs and two LIAs. As there
are no technical barriers of implementing the protocol
onto a single NV center, it appears realistic to achieve
nanoscale vector magnetometry applicable in a broad
range of temperatures including below 4 K.

IV.

CONCLUSION

In summary, we have proposed and demonstrated a
sensing method allowing simultaneous recording of all
three Cartesian components of a vector magnetic field
using a solid-state spin sensor. The method operates
at the GSLAC of NV centers, and does not employ microwaves in the measurement. Further optimization of

field (Bsz ) with a small added modulation (Bmz ). (b) Demodulated PL signal as a function of axial magnetic field with an
added transverse magnetic field modulation (Bmx ). (c) Demodulated PL signal as a function of transverse field (Bsz ) along
the x-axis while modulating the magnetic field along the same direction as (b). (d) Longitudinal (z-axis) magnetic field noise
spectrum. The blue line indicates the noise in the magnetically sensitive configuration at a magnetic field of 102.4
√ mT, the
red line indicates a noise in the magnetically insensitive configuration (average noise between
1−500
Hz
is
300
pT/
Hz), and
√
The

signal
for
the amber line illustrates the electronic noise (average noise between 1−500 Hz is 100 pT/ Hz).
√
frequencies above 1 kHz is due to the filtering of the LIA. Photon shot noise is estimated as 65 pT/ Hz. (e) Transverse magnetic
field noise spectrum (x-axis). The blue line indicates the noise in the magnetically sensitive configuration measured at zero
transverse field, the red line indicates the noise in the
√ magnetically insensitive configuration at a transverse magnetic field of
0.2 mT (average noise between
1−500
Hz
is
300
pT/
Hz), and amber line shows
√ the electronic noise spectrum (average noise
√
between 1−500 Hz is 100 pT/ Hz). Photon shot noise is estimated as 60 pT/ Hz.

the apparatus will allow a compact vector magnetometer
well suited for geophysical field measurement or biophysical imaging. The present method can be applied to the
anticrossings in other color-center systems.
The GSLAC-based vector magnetometer using NV
centers along a single axis exhibits a root mean square
noise floor of ≈ 300 pT in a transverse and the longitudinal direction. While the technique was demonstrated without monitoring the intensity of the pump
laser power, future experiments will utilize differential detection schemes and suppress laser-related noise. In addition, combination with infrared-absorption-based readout [9], or enhancement by optical cavities [11] will allow
for magnetic-field sensing with a sensitivity reaching or
even exceeding the PL shot-noise limit.
This technique should be extendable to single NV
sensors, in this case, it can be expected to advance
nanoscale real-time magnetic sensing and imaging applications, such as single molecule imaging. With the
ability to sense vector magnetic fields, this method could

potentially enable real-time imaging of magnetic dipoles
with arbitrary orientations.

FIG. 6. Demonstration of full vector capability. (a) Trajectory of the detected magnetic fields using the microwave-free vector
magnetometer. The green curve indicates the 3-D applied field and the brown curve is the projection on x-y plane. The red
arrows represent the vectors of the measured fields. (b) The three Cartesian components of both the applied (green points) and
measured
p (red circles) magnetic fields
p for each point. The applied field follows a parametric curve (black dashed lines) with
Bx = |B|2 − Bz2 cos(2πt), By = |B|2 − Bz2 sin(2πt) and Bz = 6.82 t − 3.41. (c) The altitude angle (between B and the
z-axis) θ = arccos(Bz /|B|) (yellow dots) and the azimuth angle (between the projection of B in the x-y plane and the x-axis)
φ = arctan(By /Bx ) = 2πt (blue dots) for each measured point. In the experiment, the altitude angle θ decreases in time from
180o to 0o and the azimuth angle φ increases from 0o to 360o .
