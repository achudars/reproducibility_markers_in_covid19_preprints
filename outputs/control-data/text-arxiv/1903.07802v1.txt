Understanding ultrafast coherent electron dynamics is necessary for application of a single-electron source to metrological standards1 , quantum information processing2 , including electron quantum optics3 , and quantum sensing4,5 .
While the dynamics of an electron emitted from the source has been extensively studied6–11 , there is as yet no study of the dynamics inside the source.
This is because the speed of the internal dynamics is typically higher than 100
GHz, beyond state-of-the-art experimental bandwidth2 . Here, we theoretically
and experimentally demonstrate that the internal dynamics in a silicon singleelectron source comprising a dynamic quantum dot can be detected, utilising a
resonant level with which the dynamics is read out as gate-dependent current
oscillations. Our experimental observation and simulation with realistic parameters show that an electron wave packet spatially oscillates quantum-coherently
at ∼ 200 GHz inside the source. Our results will lead to a protocol for detecting
such fast dynamics in a cavity and offer a means of engineering electron wave
packets12 . This could allow high-accuracy current sources13–16 , high-resolution
and high-speed electromagnetic-field sensing4 , and high-fidelity initialisation of
flying qubits17,18 .
Owing to recent demonstrations of high-accuracy GHz operation13–16 , a single-electron
pump with a tunable-barrier quantum dot (QD) becomes promising for application to ondemand single-electron sources1 . Because of the fast dynamic movement of the QD, there
can occur nontrivial electron dynamics, such as non-adiabatic excitation19 and subsequent
coherent time evolution. While the non-adiabatic excitation could degrade the pumping
accuracy, a spatial movement of an electron wave packet due to the coherent time evolution
can be used for engineering a wave packet emitted from the QD12 , which could make possible
electron quantum optics experiments and high-speed quantum sensing with high resolution.
In addition, understanding of the fast electron dynamics could offer insight into quantum
computing with QDs. However, the existing standard measurement technique20–22 does not
have enough bandwidth to detect fast dynamics beyond 100 GHz. In order to overcome the
limitation and detect the fast dynamics in the QD, we use a temporal change in a tunnel
rate between a resonant level in a tunnel barrier and a QD, which is induced by the dynamic
change of the QD potential.
First of all, we explain how coherent oscillations of an electron in a single-electron pump
2

occur. A single-electron pump with a tunable-barrier QD consists of the entrance (Fig. 1a,
left) and exit (right) potential barriers, formed by applying gate voltages Vent and Vexit ,
respectively23 . An AC voltage Vac (t) with frequency fin is added to dynamically tune the
entrance barrier. The QD energy level is also tuned owing to the cross coupling. When the
energy level Enqd (n = 1, 2, · · ·) of the QD with n electrons is lower than the Fermi level Ef ,

electrons can be loaded from the left lead (loading stage). After that, when Enqd is lifted and
becomes higher than Ef , the loaded electrons can escape to the left lead. However, when

the escape rate is much slower than the barrier-rise rate, the electrons can be dynamically
captured by the QD (capture stage)24 . Finally, the captured electrons can be ejected to the
right lead (ejection stage). This gives the pumping current as IP = nefin , where e is the
elementary charge. Detailed models for these three stages are found in the Supplementary
Information.
When fin is high (typically in the GHz regime), non-adiabatic excitation can occur in the
QD19 . Then, electrons can be in a superposition of the ground state and excited states. In
the case that only one electron is captured in the QD, the electron forms a wave packet6,12
moving coherently back and forth between the entrance and exit barriers in the QD, as
shown in Fig. 1b. The coherent spatial oscillations can be approximately described by a
time-dependent superposition |ψS (t)i between the instantaneous ground state |ψG (t)i and
the first excited state |ψE (t)i of the QD,

where p is the probability that the excited state is occupied and θ is the initial phase. The
oscillation period τcoh is determined by the energy gap ∆E between the ground and first
excited states, and it is written as τcoh = h/∆E when ∆E is approximately time independent.
Here, h is the Planck constant.
To check the feasibility of the non-adiabatic excitation and coherent dynamics described
by Eq. 1, we numerically solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with a realistic
potential profile (see Supplementary Information). Figure 1c shows a calculated wave-packet
distribution as a function of time and position at fin = 4 GHz. The entrance barrier
starts to push the QD away from it at around 40 ps, at which the acceleration aqd of the
horizontal movement of the QD bottom rapidly increases (inset of Fig. 1c). Around this

time, the acceleration is higher than the critical value lqd /τcoh

at the picosecond scale, which is beyond currently available bandwidth for measurements of
coherent charge oscillations20–22 .
We propose that such fast coherent oscillations can be detected using a resonant level Eres
formed in the exit barrier (Fig. 1b). While the electron moves back and forth, the potential

PT depends on the time difference t1 − t0 = (Eres − Eini
)/V̇ , which is tuned by changing the

gate voltages or the rising speed V̇ of the QD bottom. The probability becomes maximal
(minimal) when the tuning makes the electron wave packet be located near the exit (entrance) barrier at t1 , resulting in gate-dependent current oscillations. The mean probability
PT = 2πTmax ∆res /(τcoh V̇ ) depends on the transmission probability Tmax = 4ΓL ΓR /(ΓL +ΓR )2
through the resonant level and on the ratio of the energy broadening ∆res = ΓL + ΓR of the
resonant level to the energy rise τcoh V̇ in one period of the spatial oscillations, where ΓL(R)
is the coupling energy between the resonant level and QD (right lead).
The conditions for observing the gate-dependent current oscillations are

Under the left inequality, the energy uncertainty ∆E of the electron wave packet is smaller
than the resonance energy broadening ∆res so that the electron can fully pass the resonant
level12 . The right inequality is also required; in the opposite limit ∆res /V̇  τcoh , the
current becomes gate-independent because the wave packet reaches the exit barrier many
times within the time window ∆res /V̇ where the electron is allowed to pass the resonant level
(the limit ∆res /V̇  τcoh is also not acceptable because the oscillation amplitude becomes
too small, as expected from the expression of PT ).
To observe the coherent dynamics, we measure a device with a double-layer gate structure
on a non-doped silicon wire15,25 at 4.2 K (Fig. 2). The fabrication process and measurement

detail are described in Methods. This kind of device often has a resonant level in the exit
barrier, which most likely originates from an interface trap level26–28 . Such a resonant level
can be identified by investigating a map of IP as a function of Vent and Vexit (Fig. 3a). In the
map, there are several threshold voltages indicated by dashed lines. Along the red solid line,
we observe an efin current plateau (Fig. 3b). The signature of the resonant level appears
in a wide region with a current less than efin indicated by the green parallelogram, where
the direct tunneling through the exit barrier is suppressed and the resonant and inelastic
tunneling29 via the resonant level can be resolved.
We observe current oscillations in the region with the resonant-level signature (see the line
cut in Fig. 3b). In this region, the current (normalised by efin ) through the resonant level
increases with increasing fin , indicating the non-adiabatic excitation (the detail is discussed
in the Supplementary Information). To examine the current oscillations, we plot dIP /dVexit
as a function of Vent and Vexit at 1 to 4 GHz (Fig. 4). The period of the current oscillations
increases with increasing fin . This is expected from Eq. 2 because V̇ increases with increasing
fin . In addition, the period becomes shorter when the trap-ejection line (the yellow dashed

By estimating αent
and αexit
from the measurement results (see Supplementary Information),

we simulate the gate dependence of the current oscillations. Figure 5 shows calculated
current-oscillation maps as a function of Vent and Vexit at 1 to 4 GHz, corresponding directly
to Fig. 4. The peak positions with respect to the trap-ejection line are well reproduced,
including the shorter period at the trap-ejection line and the curvature of the oscillation
lines (see also discussion in the Supplementary Information).
Importantly, the only fit parameter of the calculation is ∆E = 1 meV. The QD size
(∼ 2lqd ) estimated from ∆E is about 40 nm, which is reasonable with respect to the lithographic size of our device (the first electron can be confined at the QD bottom)30 . The fact
that the current oscillations are reproduced using only reasonable parameters supports that
the experimental observation is related to the coherent dynamics of the wave packet. We
highlight that ∆E = 1 meV corresponds to τcoh ∼ 4.1 ps (1/τcoh ∼ 240 GHz), which is far

in excess of currently achievable bandwidth2,20–22 .

Here, we roughly evaluate Eq. 3 using the above results to investigate the validity of the
< ∆res <
experimental observation (see Supplementary Information), and find that 1 meV ∼
∼

6.4 meV for ∆E = 1 meV and fin = 1 GHz. The range of ∆res is acceptable, in comparison

with the energy difference (> 10 meV, estimated from the result in Fig. 3a) between the top
of the exit barrier and the resonant level; the energy difference should be larger than ∆res
to observe the current oscillations.
We note that we have considered other possible mechanisms for observed current oscillations, but have not found any alternative explanations. We can neglect the possibilities of
the phonon density of states31 and the Fabry-Perot interference through an unintentionallyformed QD32 because they should be independent of fin . We also rule out Landau-ZenerStückelberg interference33 (see Supplementary Information).
Our results imply a protocol for measuring such a fast dynamics. We suggest that when
any kind of dynamic control of a particle in a cavity, including its initialisation, excitation,
and coherent oscillations, is repeated by frequency f , the coherent dynamics can be detected
as oscillations of the current of the particle through the resonant level, by coupling the
cavity to any kind of a resonant level driven by an AC signal with f (see Supplementary
10

Information).
Finally, we stress that the understanding of the internal coherent dynamics is useful for
engineering an emitted wave packet, for example, to be a Gaussian form12 . A Gaussian
wave packet has a narrow wave-packet width in terms of energy or time (achieving the
Heisenberg uncertainty limit), and such a narrow wave packet could lead to ultimately highspeed and high-resolution quantum sensing4 and enhancement of the visibility of electron
quantum optics experiments3 . Furthermore, since internal coherent dynamics affect the
initialisation of flying qubits17,18 , this understanding could contribute to the improvement of
the initialisation fidelity. In addition, further investigation of the non-adiabatic excitation
using the method proposed in this Letter could lead to improvement of the accuracy of singleelectron pumping, which contributes to the realisation of high-accuracy current sources.

METHODS
Device fabrication
A silicon wire is patterned using electron beam lithography and dry etching on a nondoped silicon-on-insulator wafer with a buried-oxide thickness of 400 nm. After formation
of thermally grown silicon dioxide with a thickness of 30 nm, three lower gates made of
heavily-doped polycrystalline silicon are formed using chemical vapor deposition, electron
beam lithography, and dry etching. The spacing of the adjacent lower gates is 100 nm.
Then, an inter-layer silicon dioxide is deposited using chemical vapor deposition. Next, an
upper gate made of heavily-doped polycrystalline silicon is formed using chemical vapor
deposition, optical lithography, and dry etching. Then, the left and right leads are heavily
doped using ion implantation, during which the upper gate is used as an implantation mask.
Finally, aluminum pads are formed to obtain an Ohmic contact. The width and thickness
of the silicon wire are 15 and 10 nm, respectively.

Measurement detail
Measurements were performed in liquid He at 4.2 K. DC and AC voltages were applied
using the Keithley 213 voltage source and Keysight 83623B signal generator, respectively.
The pumping current was measured using the Keithley 6514 electrometer. DC voltage Vupper
is applied to the upper gate to induce electrons in the silicon wire. Vent + Vac (t) and Vexit
are applied to the entrance and exit gates, respectively, where Vac (t) = Vamp cos (2πfin t) with
amplitude Vamp .

can be modeled by a cascade of electron escapes from the QD to left lead: the decay cascade model1 . In this model,
we can obtain the capture probabilities of electrons by the QD by solving the master equation. When the charge

To obtain an analytical equation, we simplify the time-dependent voltage applied to the entrance gate as a linear

Ejection of electrons to the right lead can be also modeled using the master equation, which has the same form as
that of the capture, with ejection rate ΓE

Loading stage

The probability of the initial loading of electrons at the lowest QD energy level can be determined by the alignment
between the QD energy level and Fermi level. In this case, we should observe multiple loading lines reflecting Eadd .
However, this is not the case in our device because our results show that the loading line is shared with all plateaus,
which is usually observed in other devices4,5 . Thus, it would be determined by the loading rate through the entrance
barrier. Since the lowest QD energy level should be much deeper than the Fermi level, we assume for simplicity that
the loading from the left lead with the loading rate ΓL (t) only contributes. For the evaluation of the alpha factors
related to the entrance barrier, it would be enough to consider the master equation of the loading probability P1L of
the first electron, which can be written as

ESTIMATION OF DEVICE PARAMETERS

Charge addition energy Eadd

Eadd is equal to the charging energy EC = e2 /CQD at the efin plateau, where CQD is the total capacitance of the
QD, because of the spin degeneracy. To estimate EC , we use the upper gate dependence of the current plateau at a
high temperature of 17 K (Fig. S2). For evaluation of the efin plateau, we change the alpha factor of the exit gate to
that of the upper gate in Eq. S16 and simplify the equation as

C
where Vl is the threshold voltage of the lth plateau. In this case, αupper
(V2 − V1 ) = (1 + 1/g)EC . However, the
experimental results have different alpha factors for the first and second plateaus possibly because of the gate depenC
C
dence of the capacitances. Thus, we use different alpha factors (αupper1
and αupper2
for the first and second plateaus,
C
respectively) and the averaged value of them for the estimation of EC instead of αupper . Another difficulty is the g
value, which can not be directly estimated from Fig. S2. The g value is an indicator of the pumping mechanism of
the capture: the decay cascade model is suitable at g  1 and the thermal equilibrium model is suitable at g  13 .
Here, we assume that the mechanism is close to the decay cascade model, which is typical in our device6 , and g is
assumed to be 10 (see Fig. 5f in Ref. 3). Note that the contribution of g is small at g > 10 because the factor used
in the estimation is 1 + 1/g. From the parameters extracting the fitting, we obtain EC = 12 meV and CQD = 14 aF.

Barrier modulation

Since the modulations of the entrance and exit barriers by the entrance and exit gates, respectively, are just the
operation of the transistors, the alpha factors related to them can be estimated from the subthreshold slope Sent(exit) of
ln(10)
. Figure S3 shows DC characteristics of the entrance and exit gates in
the transistors: αentBarrier(exitBarrier) = SkTent(exit)
the subthreshold regime at 300 K, where the black lines are linear fits of ln(Current). From the parameters extracted
from the fits, αentBarrier = 0.49 eV/V and αexitBarrier = 0.48 eV/V.

T = 300 K

Figure S3. DC current as a function of Vent (red circles) and Vexit (purple circles) at T = 300 K, where voltages applied to the
other gates are 1 V. The DC bias is almost zero (only an offset voltage of the ammeter). From the fit lines, the subthreshold
slopes are estimated, resulting in 1.2 × 102 mV/decade for the entrance (Sent ) and exit (Sexit ) gates.

6
Cross couplings for entrance & exit barriers

αexit entBarrier can be estimated from the loading lines because Eq. S38 contains αexit entBarrier and αentBarrier . The
red dashed line in Fig. S4a is the loading lines on the Vent -Vexit map. αexit entBarrier is the product of αentBarrier and
the absolute value of the slope of the loading line. From the estimated values of the slopes, αexit entBarrier = 0.052
eV/V.
αent exitBarrier can be estimated from DC transport characteristics but we use a different way to extract it because
of the lack of the data. Here, we use the data of another device that was fabricated on the same wafer with the same
design as the device in this paper. Figure S4b shows a contour plot of a DC current as a function of Vent and Vexit
at 300 K. From the slope A, we estimate αexit entBarrier /αentBarrier = 0.11, which is the same value as the absolute
value of the slope of the loading line shown in Fig. S4a, indicating the same device structure. Then, from the slope
B, αent exitBarrier /αexitBarrier = 0.076, leading to αent exitBarrier = 0.037 eV/V. Note that the slight asymmetric value
of the slopes A and B would results from the small difference of the gate length.

which is similar to Eq. S39. From a relation of [(1 + 1/g)αexit

discussed below, we use the 10-MHz data, which has clear ejection lines, to extract the spacing between the ejection

NUMERICAL CALCULATION OF TIME-DEPENDENT SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION

We here show that the nonadiabatic excitation and coherent oscillations, described by Eq. 1 of the main text, can
be induced in the experimental setup in Fig. 2 of the main text. We first show that the adiabatic condition is violated
in the experiment, based on rough estimation from the experimental parameters. Then we numerically calculate the
Schrödinger equation governed by a realistic potential profile of the time-dependent QD. The result (Fig. 1c in the
main text) shows the coherent oscillations of Eq. 1. In addition, calculations with respect to various gate voltages
confirm that the onset of the non-adiabatic excitation is determined by Eq. 6 of the main text.

V, Vexit = −0.7 V, Vamp = 1.415 V, xent = 0, and xexit = 100 nm. The plots are vertically shifted for clarity. In the inset, the
position of the QD potential minimum at the selected times (see the markers) is shown.

We show that the adiabatic condition is violated in the experiment, based on rough estimation from the experimental
parameters. For the purpose, we focus on the spatial movement of the QD (see Fig. 1b in the main text). The
adiabatic condition is δx/δt  lqd /τcoh , which means that the QD moves distance δx, much shorter than lqd , during
the time δt much longer than h/∆E. We consider a simple QD potential U (x, t) based on the experimentally
estimated parameters. The simplification is that the potential is parabolic near the potential minimum and the
potential induced by the entrance gate linearly decreases from the entrance barrier side to the potential minimum,
∆E

realistic parameters, we find δx/δt ' 9.7 nm/ps, which is about two times larger than lqd /τcoh = 4.9 nm/ps. Here we

used the parameters of αent
QD , αent QD and αentBarrier shown in Table S1, αent QD = (αent QD + αent QD )/2 (which
is chosen as rough average during the pumping), |V̇ac | = 5.6 mV/ps (which is the average value of V̇ac during the
first half of the pumping with f = 1 GHz and Vamp = 1.4 V), x0 = 50 nm roughly obtained from the gate geometry,
∆E = 1 meV as estimated in the main manuscript, and lqd = 20 nm is determined by ∆E and the electron effective

9
mass m = 0.19me with the bare mass me . The estimation implies that nonadiabatic excitation occurs but not too
strongly so that the occupation of the first excited state of the QD dominates over those of the other excited states
(see Eq. 1 of the main text). Note that this estimation is based on the essential parameters characterizing the pump,
rather than relying on the details of the potential profile.
Next, we explain the potential profile of the dynamic QD that is used in the numerical calculations of the timedependent Schrödinger equation. The potential profile is contributed from the potentials induced by the entrance,
exit, and upper gates [see Fig. S6(a)],

(S41)

The potentials Uent induced by the entrance gate and Uexit by the exit gate together form the QD in the region
between the gate edge positions xent and xexit [see the black curve in Fig. S6(a)]. Away from the gate edges, the
potential exponentially decays with the decay length determined by the alpha factors in Table S1. The profile in
Eq. S41 captures this feature: Uent has the value of −αentBarrier (Vent + Vac (t)) at x = xent and exponentially decays
to −αent exitBarrier (Vent + Vac (t)) at x = xexit . Similarly, Uexit has the value of −αexitBarrier Vexit at x = xexit and
exponentially decays to −αexit entBarrier Vexit at x = xent . On the other hand, the upper gate induces the potential
Uupper nontrivially, since the entrance and exit gates screen the electric field induced by the upper gate (see Fig. 2 of
the main text). For positive Vupper , the screening reduces the effect of the upper gate in the region underneath the
entrance (exit) gates, resulting in the formation of the two potential barrier contributions corresponding to the two
terms of Uupper (x) in Eq. S41. The barriers have width Lent and Lexit , respectively, and exponentially decay from the
maximum value Uscr within length Lscr [see the blue curve in Fig. S6(a)]. We roughly choose the values of Uscr = 1
eV and Lscr = 1 nm. We note that the time evolution determined by the potential profile is well described by Eqs.
1 and 6 of the main text, insensitively to the detailed values of Uscr and Lscr . In addition, the detailed shape of the
outer parts of the potential profile [shown as the black dashed curves and the blue dashed curves in Fig. S6(a)] does
not affect the coherent oscillations of the wave packet when the non-adiabatic excitation occurs not too strongly.
The potential profile of Eq. S41 evolves in time as in Fig. S6(b) during a half period of pumping cycle. During the
time from 0 to 40 ps [see the lowest three curves in Fig. S6(b)], the QD is formed at xent near the entrance gate.
At around 40 ps, the QD starts to be pushed away from xent because of the formation of the entrance barrier. The
potential bottom of the QD follows the trajectory shown as the red curve in the inset of Fig. S6(b). This spatial
movement of the QD is the dominant factor resulting in the nonadiabatic excitation; we observe that the excitation
probability becomes ∼ 10−2 times smaller if the spatial shift of the QD bottom is artificially compensated by a shift
of the whole potential profile.
We compute the time evolution of the wave packet inside the QD, shown in Fig. 1c, solving the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation. The spatial movement of the QD, the origin of the nonadiabatic excitation, is taken into account
as follows: We simplify the QD potential such that the potential profile has time-independent parabolic shape but
its potential minimum moves following the trajectory shown in the inset of Fig. S6(b); the trajectory is determined
by the realistic parameters and Eq. S41 as discussed above. The level spacing of the QD is chosen as ∆E = 1 meV.
The initial wave function at t = 0 is chosen as the ground state wave packet of the potential profile at the initial time
t = 0. We note that the calculation result of the time evolution is insensitive to the choice of the initial time as long
2
as the acceleration of the QD at the initial time is much slower than lqd /τcoh
.
The time evolution shown in Fig. 1c is obtained at 4 GHz pumping frequency. The nonadiabatic excitation occurs
2
around the time of 40 ps, as the acceleration of the QD movement becomes faster than lqd /τcoh
; see the inset of
Fig. 1c. After that, the time evolution is well described by Eq. 1 in the main text. The contribution of the higher
excited states of the QD to the nonadiabatic evolution is ∼ 10−2 smaller than that of the first excited state.
We calculate the time evolution of the wave packet for different values of Vent and Vexit in Fig. S7, which shows
the relative phase φrel (t) ≡ angle[hψE |ψS (t)i/hψG |ψS (t)i] between the ground state and the first excited state in the
superposition representing the time evolution (see Eq. 1 in the main text). At time t0 determined by Eq. 6, the
relative phase starts to increase linearly with the rate of ∆E/h̄ ∼ 2π/4 ps. t0 changes with Vent [see the blue line in

Fig. S7(a)], but t0 is independent of Vexit [see the blue line in Fig. S7(b)]. These results confirm that the onset of the
non-adiabatic excitation is determined by Eq. 6 of the main text.
We discuss the probability p of the non-adiabatic excitation in Eq. 1 in the main text. A non-trivial point is whether
the excitation probability p is sufficiently large in our experiment. Typically, fin is 1 - 10 GHz5,7–9 , which corresponds
to the photon energy of hfin ∼ 4 - 40 µeV. On the other hand, ∆E is typically about 500 µeV10 or more. Based on a
perturbation theory, one might expect that the non-adiabatic excitation does not occur, since hfin  ∆E. However,
our experiment is in a non-perturbative regime so that multiple photons can be absorbed by the electron in the QD,
hence, the probability p can be sufficiently large to have the coherent oscillations, as the numerical solution of the
Schrödinger equation indicates.

Figure S8. Scattering model for electron ejection from the dynamic quantum dot (QD, the potential well of coordinate
l ∈ [−L, 0]) to the outside (the x > 0 region) through the resonant level (depicted by the red Lorentzian peak). The QD is
formed between the left and right potential barriers (gray regions), and the resonant level exists in the right barrier. The rise of
the QD potential bottom is described by the time-dependent potential energy V (t). The scattering of an electron plane wave
with energy E by the resonant level is described by the reflection amplitudes (rE , rE0 ) and transmission amplitudes (dE , d0E ) of
the plane wave.

11
We explain the scattering model. The coherent time evolution of the wave packet inside the dynamic QD and its
emission through the resonant level (see Fig. 1b in the main text) can be described by the model in Fig. S8. The
QD is simplified as the one-dimensional rectangular quantum well of coordinate l ∈ [−L, 0]. The rise of the potential
bottom of the QD is described by the time-dependent potential energy V (t). The resonant level is located inside the
right barrier of the QD (between l = 0 and x = 0). The transmission amplitude of the plane wave with energy E
through the resonant level from the inside to outside (from the outside to the inside) of the QD is dE (d0E ), while its
reflection amplitude inside (outside) the QD is rE (rE0 ). The transmission amplitude dE has a non-negligible value
around the resonant level Eres . This is described by
|dE |2 =

Tmax
,
1 + 4(E − Eres )2 /∆2res

(S42)

where ∆res is the resonant-level broadening (see the red Lorentzian peak in Fig. S8) and Tmax is the transmission
probability at E = Eres . The energy dispersion relation inside and outside the QD is simplified as E = h̄vk, where
k is the momentum of the electron and v is the electron velocity. The simplifications introduced above are good
approximations when the condition ∆res /V̇  τcoh (see the second inequality of Eq. 3 in the main text) is satisfied.
The condition means that the time scale ∆res /V̇ , within which the transmission amplitude of the plane wave with
energy E through the resonant level is non-negligible, is much shorter than the period τcoh of the coherent oscillations
of the electron wave packet. Since the scattering of the wave packet by the resonant level occurs within the short
time scale ∆res /V̇ , it is well described by the simplified model.
Using the scattering model, we solve the time evolution of the wave packet ψ0 = ψS (t0 ) localised in the QD at
initial time t0 (see Eq. 1 in the main text). For the purpose, we obtain11 the time-dependent scattering state ΨE (t) of
the electron
plane wave incoming from x = ∞ to the QD with kinetic energy E, and we write ψ0 as the superposition
R
|ψ0 i = dE aE |ΨE (t0 )i of those scattering states at time t0 . Here, in the derivation of the scattering states, the effects
of the time dependence V (t) of the QD potential and the
R resonant level are taken into account. Then, the time
evolution of the state ψ0 at time t > t0 is determined by dE aE |ΨE (t)i.
Using the spatial distribution of the time evolved wave function outside the QD, we derive the ejection probability
PT . Below, we provide the details of the derivation of PT .
We first obtain the scattering state |ΨE (t)i. This state results from the scattering, by the resonant level, of a plane
wave e−iE(t+x/v) of energy E incoming from x = ∞ outside the QD. This state is written as a superposition of states
of energy different from E because the QD potential has the time dependence V (t). To treat the time dependence,
we apply a gauge transformation of the QD potential bottom Φ and the vector potential A,

becomes time independent.

Instead, the electron wave function inside the QD gains the phase factor eiφ(t) ≡ ei −∞ V (u) du . In terms of the phase
factor and the scattering amplitudes dE , rE , d0E , rE0 , we obtain |ΨE i (see the steps in Eqs. S11-S17 in Ref. 11. The

where tr ≡ t − x/v. Each term of index M in Eq. S45 describes the process that the incident electron of energy E
enters the QD at time tr − M τcoh , travels the distance 2L of the QD (from its right end l = 0 to the left end l = −L
and then to the right end) M times, and then escapes from the QD at time tr . In the M = 1 term we use Π0M =1 ≡ 1
instead of 0, for brevity. Note that Eq. S45 corresponds to Eq. S17 in Ref.11 except the factor (−1)M , which comes
from the boundary condition that the wave function vanishes at the left end l = −L of the QD.
R
Now we write the initial localised wave packet ψ0 at time t0 as the superposition |ψ0 i = dE aE |ΨE (t0 )i of the
scattering states, and obtain the expansion coefficient aE . We first simplify the Eq. S44 at time t0 by choosing
V (t) = V (t0 ) for time t < t0 (this choice does not affect the time evolution of the packet ψ0 ),

Because at time t0 the packet in the QD is localised inside the QD (namely the electron does not exist outside the

energy E that satisfies the resonant condition of E = V (t0 ) + En , where En ≡ 2nπ/τcoh is the energy quantisation
of the QD, n = 1, 2, · · · , and V (t0 ) + En ’s are the energy levels of the QD at time t0 . The second term is well

Next, we obtain the emitted part of the time evolved wave function ψ(x, t) = dEaE hx|ΨE (t)i at t > t0 . For the

except the sign factor (−1) that comes from the boundary condition at the left end l = −L of the QD. The physical
meaning of Eq. S49 is as follows. Each (n, m) term describes that an electron occupies the nth QD level at time t0 and
Rt
then is emitted after m oscillations. It gains the dynamical phase t0r (En + V (t0 ))dt0 . The amplitude of the emission
is determined by m reflections at the energies En + V (tr − mτcoh ), En + V (tr − (m − 1)τcoh ) , · · · , En + V (tr − τcoh ) and
the final transmission through the resonant level at the energy En + V (tr ). hnQD |ψ0 i is the weight that an electron
occupies the nth level of the QD at time t0 .
Finally, we obtain the ejection probability PT of ψ0 through the resonant
wave packet form

and inelastic tunneling through the resonant level in the exit barrier. V̇ is the rising speed of the QD bottom. The inelastic
tunneling occurs with a phonon emission.

We discuss the experimental signature of the non-adiabatic excitation in our device. At first, we start from the lowfrequency 50-MHz data, which should be in the adiabatic regime. Figure S9a shows a dIP /dVexit map as a function of
Vent and Vexit with Vupper = 2.5 V. In this map, there is only an ejection line related to the direct tunneling through
the exit barrier (blue dashed line). However, with decreasing Vupper (Figs. S9b and S9c), an additional line appears
(red dashed line) and the ejection line almost disappears at Vupper = 2 V. The additional current flow indicates that
there is another current path through a resonant level, which is probably due to the interface trap level in the exit

14
barrier12–14 . We refer the red dashed line to as the trap-ejection line. Between the ejection and trap-ejection lines, the
direct tunneling through the exit barrier is suppressed but the resonant tunneling through the resonant level during
the rise of the QD energy level and the inelastic tunneling with phonon emission after the QD energy level is higher
than the resonant level would occur15 (Fig. S9d). These current flows strongly depend on the coupling between the
QD energy and resonant levels. When we increase Vupper , the central part of the QD mainly lowers because of the
screening by the lower gates (see Fig. 2 in the main text), resulting in a stronger confinement of the QD. This would
reduce the coupling between the QD energy and resonant levels, leading to the decrease in the current through the
resonant level.
Then, we fix Vupper = 2.5 V, at which the tunneling rate through the resonant level from the ground state of the QD
is low. With increasing fin , the trap-ejection line appears and becomes clear (Figs. S10a - S10g). This indicates that
the excited states are populated, because the wave functions of the excited states have peaks closer to the edge of the
QD than that of the ground state and the coupling between the QD energy and resonant levels is stronger. In addition,
the current level normalised by efin between the ejection and trap-ejection lines increases with increasing fin in spite
of the decreased time duration during which the QD energy level is higher than the resonant level (Fig. S10h). This
indicates that the excitation probability increases with increasing fin , which is consistent with the previous report4 .
Note that the ejection line becomes broad when the excitation occurs, which would be a signature of the inelastic
tunneling15 .
In addition, the current oscillations appear at the ejection line from the 600-MHz data and the oscillations become
clearer at higher fin . Since the period of the current oscillations is large enough compared with the voltage resolution,
the decrease of the contrast with decreasing fin would be related to the decoherence. Actually, we observe low contrast
of the current oscillations near the trap-ejection line at 1 GHz (around the blue arrow in Fig. 4a in the main text),
but the 2-GHz data does not have a similar decrease of the contrast (around the blue arrow in Fig. 4b in the main
text). Since t1 − t0 is maximal at the trap-ejection line, the decrease of the contrast might be due to decoherence.
If so, the decoherence time is 0.1 - 1 ns, which is of a similar order of magnitude as the decoherence time of typical
coherent charge oscillations16–18 . Note that the spacing between the loading and trap-ejection lines are different at
different fin because the cross talk of the high-frequency signal is different at different fin .

ESTIMATION OF t1

The final time t1 of the coherent time evolution can be the time when the mean QD energy level is aligned with
the resonant level. We approximately use E1qd instead of the mean energy: E1qd (t1 ) = Eres (t1 ). The approximation is
valid with the condition of Eq. 3 in the main text. Since Vac (t) = Vamp cos (2πfin t), E1qd can be written as (see Eq.
S5)
qd
− αent QD Vamp cos (2πfin t1 ) .
E1qd (t1 ) = Eoff

(S51)

To estimate Eres , we assume that the gate dependence of Eres can be the same as U exit (t) because the trap-ejection
line is parallel with the ejection line. Then, Eres can be written as (see Eq. S4)
exit
Eres (t1 ) = Uoff
− αent exitBarrier Vamp cos (2πfin t1 ) .

From Eqs. S7, S8, S51, and S52, E1qd (t1 ) = Eres (t1 ) leads to

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF FIGS 4 AND 5

There is some mismatch between Figs. 4 and 5 in the main text, although the calculation reproduces the main
features of the experimental results. For example, the mismatch of the voltage axis values is due to ignorance of
some gate-independent constants in the derivation of t1 . In addition, it is difficult to reproduce the amplitude of the
current oscillations, because it depends on many parameters (∆res , p, ΓL(R) , decoherence) and because ∆E and the
alpha factors can weakly change dynamically.
VIII.

EVALUATION OF EQ. 3

For the evaluation of Eq. 3 in the main text, we roughly estimate V̇ . Since the gate-QD coupling changes in the
E
C
capture and ejection stages (see Table S1), we use an averaged value αave = (αent
QD + αent QD )/2 ∼ 0.27 eV/V.
Then, we estimate the average value of V̇ during the first half of the pumping, V̇ ∼ 4fin αave Vamp ∼ 1.54 eV/ns at 1
GHz. Since ∆E ∼ 1 meV, τcoh V̇ = hV̇ /∆E ∼ 6.4 meV.

LANDAU-ZENER-STÜCKELBERG INTERFERENCE

Since the QD energy and resonant levels can be considered as a double-QD system, the Landau-Zener-Stückelberg
(LZS) interference19,20 could be a candidate of the origin of the current oscillations. However, this is not the case as
explained below.
Figure S11 shows a schematic energy diagram of the QD energy (blue line) and resonant (red line) levels as a
function of time. When the QD energy level is close to the resonant level, an avoided crossing of them occurs (purple
line)21 , which depends on the coupling energy ΓL between the two levels. Since the QD energy level passes the
resonant level twice, the LZS interference could occur. When the final state is the resonant (QD energy) level, there
should be (no) current flows. The interference period depends on the accumulated phase φLZ after the QD energy
level crosses the resonant level, which is written as

which is order of ΓL in time duration τc (see the purple line). The integral of the correction term is on the order of

(S56)

When we increase Vent , the QD energy level is lowered with respect to the resonant level, resulting in smaller ∆t.
This indicates that the oscillation period (∆Vent ) increases with increasing Vent . This is opposite to the experimental
observation (see Fig. 4b in the main text). Thus, we conclude that the LZS interference is not the origin of the current
oscillations. The reason why we do not observe the LZS interference might be that the following condition is not
satisfied: ΓL < h̄/∆t < ΓR .

PROTOCOL FOR DETECTING FAST WAVE-PACKET DYNAMICS IN A CAVITY

Here, we discuss an implication of our results. Our findings suggest a general protocol for detecting fast dynamics
of a wave packet in a cavity.
Coherent wave-packet oscillations can generally occur when a particle (such as an electron) is confined in a cavity
(such as a quantum dot) and driven by AC voltages in a non-adiabatic fashion. This can happen in quantum
nanodevices operated for many purposes. The motion of such wave packets is typically much faster than the range
directly measurable with currently available bandwidth. Based on our findings in the main text, we propose a protocol
for detecting such fast coherent wave-packet oscillations using a resonant level formed in an artificial atom such as a
quantum dot.
Figure S12 shows a setup for the protocol, which consists of a cavity hosting coherent wave-packet spatial oscillations
of a particle and an artificial atom having a resonant energy level. Initially, the resonant energy level (see the red
dashed Lorentzian peak in the figure) is much higher than the energy of the particle. Then the energy of the resonant
level decreases with rate V̇a and reaches the value far below the energy of the particle (below at least by the energy
uncertainty of the particle wave packet). When the resonant level becomes aligned with the energy of the particle,
the particle can transmit through the resonant level to move out of the cavity. The transmission probability is large
(small) if the particle wave packet is located at the right (left) side of the cavity. Hence, by measuring the current of

Figure S12. Protocol for detecting fast wave-packet dynamics in a cavity. The cavity hosts coherent oscillations (depicted by
arrows) of a wave packet (a blue peak) of a particle. The oscillations are detected by the particle current through a timedependent resonant level (red Lorentzian peak), formed by an artificial atom such as a quantum dot. The shift (vertical arrow)
of the resonant level is driven by a local gate (orange rectangle).

the particle outside the cavity, one can get the information of the coherent spatial oscillations of the particle. Note
that an amount of the current large enough for the detection can be collected by repeating the above process from
the initialization of the wave-packet oscillations to the time-dependent change of the resonant level.
This protocol corresponds to the measurement of the coherent spatial oscillations of an electron wave packet shown
in the main text; the resonant level is artificially generated here in the protocol. The time resolution of the protocol
is ∆res /V̇a , according to the second inequality of Eq. 3 in the main text. The time resolution can be much larger than
the currently available experimental bandwidth, when sufficiently large V̇a is applied. For example, using the energy
broadening ∆res ∼ 1 meV of the resonant level and V̇a ∼ 1 eV/ns (which are within experimental reach, as shown in
the main text), one can achieve the resolution of ∆res /V̇a = 1 ps. The resolution is equivalent with 1 THz, which is
far in excess of currently achievable bandwidth of 10 GHz.
