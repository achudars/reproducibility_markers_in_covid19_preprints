Abstract: The effects of spin-orbit coupling and symmetry breaking at the interface
between a ferromagnet and heavy metal are particularly important for spin-based
information storage and computation. Recent discoveries suggest they can create
chiral spin structures (e.g. skyrmions), which have often been identified through the
appearance of the bump/dip features of Hall signals, the so-called topological Hall
effect (THE). In this work, however, we have present an unusual anomalous Hall
effect (UAHE) in MnxGa/Pt bilayers and demonstrated that the features extremely
similar to THE can be generated without involving any chiral spin structures. The low
temperature magnetic force microscopy has been used to explore the magnetic
field-dependent behavior of spin structures, and the UAHE as a function of magnetic
field does not peak near the maximal density of magnetic bubbles. The results
unambiguously evidence that the UAHE in MnxGa/Pt bilayers shows no correlation
with chiral spin structures but is driven by the modified interfacial properties. The
bump/dip features of Hall signals cannot be taken as an unambiguous signature for the
emergence of chiral spin structures, and a wealth of underlying and interesting
1

physics need explored.

Interface-driven magnetic effects and phenomena associated with spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) and intrinsic symmetry breaking at interfaces are at the forefront of
condensed-matter physics research [1]. Effects at interfaces can be classified as
emergent in the sense that complex unanticipated phenomena emerge from apparently
simple materials and interactions, providing challenges of predictability and design of
functionality [2, 3]. It has only recently been appreciated that interfaces, particularly
those where SOC is strong, can fundamentally change the magnetic ground states in
the ferromagnet (FM)/heavy metal (HM) heterostructures. Owing to the presence of
strong SOC and inversion asymmetry, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), an
antisymmetric exchange interaction that favors a chiral arrangement of the
magnetization, will be generated [2-4]. It is in the form of D12   S1 S2  , where the
vector D12 represents the DMI strength, S1 and S 2 are the total spin of two nearby
atoms [5, 6]. When the DMI is sufficiently strong compared to other interactions, it
could lead to topologically protected (chiral) spin structures, such as skyrmions or
skyrmion lattices [7]. Skyrmions can be defined by the topological number N, which
is a scale of the winding of the normalized local magnetization, m. In the
two-dimensional limit, the topological number is N 

1
m( x m  y m )dxdy [3,
4π 

7]. This non-trivial topological property governs some of the most important
properties of skyrmions including the topological Hall effect (THE) [8-10]. When a
conduction electron passes through a skyrmion, the spin of the conduction electron
will adiabatically follow the texture and acquire a real-space Berry phase, which
deflects the conduction electrons perpendicular to the current direction and causes an
additional contribution to the observed Hall signals termed as THE, characterized by
the appearance of bumps or dips in the Hall measurements. The effective magnetic
ﬁeld can be described by Beff 

c
z m ( x m  y m ) , which is closely related to the
2e

definition of topological number (3). However, the above real-space Berry phase
2

picture is valid only if the exchange coupling between electrons and local
magnetization is strong (adiabatic approximation), while it fails in the weak coupling
regime (non-adiabatic approximation) since the electrons fail to adjust their spin to the
local magnetization and the spin-flip processes are activated [11-13]. In such a regime,
the electrons will experience an inhomogeneous emergent ﬁeld as there is randomly
distributed chiral spin structures, in contrast to electrons in bulk systems which
experience a systematically varying uniform emergent magnetic field due to the
ordered arrangement of chiral spin structures such as skyrmion crystals [14].
In this work, however, we report an unusual anomalous Hall effect (UAHE) that
can generate the same transport features of the THE without involving any chiral spin
structures. Low temperature magnetic force microscopy (MFM) results indicate that
the additional Hall signals as a function of magnetic field at 3.5 K does not peak near
the maximal density of magnetic bubbles. The results unambiguously evidence that
the UAHE in MnxGa/Pt bilayers shows no correlation with chiral spin structures but is
driven by the modified interfacial properties due to the emergence of strong interfacial
SOC introduced by Pt. The bump/dip features of Hall signals cannot be taken as an
unambiguous signature for the emergence of chiral spin structures, and it should be
treated discreetly since a wealth of underlying and interesting physics are often
regrettably missed.
For this study, we prepared magnetic bilayers of MnxGa 6 nm/Pt 5 nm (x=1.0,
1.25, 1.55) and a reference sample of MnxGa 6 nm/Al 5 nm (see also Materials and
Methods). The 1-nm-thick MnxGa ﬁlms were ﬁrstly grown on 100-nm-thick GaAs
buffered semi-insulating GaAs (001) substrates at 70℃ by molecular-beam epitaxy
with controlling the ﬂux of Mn and Ga atoms. Then the films were annealed at
300 ℃ for 1 min, and other 5-nm-thick MnGa ﬁlms were continued to be grown at
300 ℃ after the annealing. Finally, the films were transferred to the magnetron
sputtering system immediately through a lower vacuum chamber, and 5-nm-thick Al
or Pt films were deposited on top of the MnxGa films. All the films have been
patterned into Hall bars in the size of 10 μm × 80 μm using photolithography and Ar
ion milling. Similar to our previous work [15-17], both the Hall resistivity and
longitudinal resistivity in this work were determined by subtracting the contributions
of the MnxGa single layer by assuming a parallel resistor model. By subtracting the
H-linear ordinary Hall term ( 0  R0 H ) from the total Hall resistivity  XY , we have
3

obtained the sum of other Hall contributions of the MnxGa/Pt bilayers under
perpendicularly applied magnetic ﬁeld (H) as shown in Figure 1 (a)-(c). Bumps or
dips emerge in the whole temperature range from 5 to 300 K for all the three bilayers.
Fig. 1 (d)-(f) show the temperature dependence of magnetoresistance (MR),
MR= ( XX ( H )  XX (0)) / XX (0) , under perpendicular magnetic field. The sign of
MR changes from negative to positive as the temperature decreases. Both the Hall and
longitudinal signals are quite different from those of MnxGa/Al bilayers [18], in which
the transport properties are determined by the single MnxGa layers [16]. Compared to
MnxGa/Al, the MnxGa/Pt bilayers show distinct temperature dependences of
anomalous Hall resistivity  A and longitudinal resistivity  XX [18]. It is found that

 A can be described by scaling law A  XX0  b 2XX with XX for the MnxGa/Al
bilayers [18], where  and b denote extrinsic skew scattering and intrinsic
mechanism respectively, XX0 is the residual resistivity induced by impurity
scattering [19]. We believe that 6 nm MnxGa is thick enough to prevent the
deterioration of its bulk magnetic properties, and new magnetic states or transport
features are expected to be of interfacial nature. Then, we attempt to investigate the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the MnxGa/Pt bilayers using the same scaling law.
Fig. 2 (a)-(c) show the experimental and fitted relationships between  A and  2 XX .
At relatively high temperatures, the scaling law is found to work only for large  XX .
The slope b of the MnxGa/Pt bilayers is similar to that in the MnxGa/Al bilayers
with the same Mn component x, indicating the same intrinsic nature of the MnxGa
films. In the low temperature limit, there are large positive deviations, which should
be ascribed to the increase of  A since  XX decreases monotonically with
decreasing temperature and then approaches a constant due to weak Kondo effect [18].
The upturn of  A is an indicative of the onset of large extrinsic skew scattering due to
the strong SOC of impurities. The temperature dependence of  has been shown in
Fig. 2(d), and a deviation has been found in the low temperature limit.
After subtracting ordinary and anomalous Hall signals, we can get additional
Hall resistivities XY  XY  0  A as shown in Figs. 3(a)-(c), and the shapes of
XY  H  reverse in the low temperature limit with sweeping magnetic field from
max
positive to negative. The temperature dependences of the largest XY (  XY
) in all

4

the bilayers have been shown in Fig. 3(d), and a sign change is observed for all the
bilayers at low temperature. Here, we use MFM to determine the correspondence of
transport features with the spin structures. Fig. 3(e) shows an illustrative example of
such images in the Mn1.55Ga/Al bilayers after saturating with a positive magnetic field
of H=5 to 0 T at 300 K. The magnetization is almost fully aligned in the positive
magnetic field direction and the MFM image shows several magnetic bubbles. For the
Mn1.55Ga/Pt bilayers as shown in Fig. 3(f), a dilute density of small magnetic bubbles
in the size of 100~200 nm have emerged among the worm-like or the long stripes
patterns. It suggests that the magnetic bubbles have emerged in both the Mn1.55Ga/Al
and Mn1.55Ga/Pt bilayers, while only the latter exhibits non-zero XY at the zero
magnetic field. The most different mechanisms in these two bilayers is that a strong
interfacial SOC is only introduced in Mn1.55Ga/Pt bilayers, which will profoundly
modify both the magnetic and transport features. In the presence of interfacial DMI
induced by strong SOC, the domain wall configuration in the Mn1.55Ga/Pt bilayers
may be in Néel type with fixed chirality [20]. On the contrary, in the Mn1.55Ga/Al
bilayers that lack interfacial DMI, the magnetic bubbles were solely stabilized by
strong dipole interactions that give rise to a rich collection of spin structures with
non-uniform spin chirality [21]. Therefore, the chirality of the spin structures in the
MnxGa/Pt bilayers cannot be identified, and we first speculate that the non-zero
XY (0) at 300 K in Mn1.55Ga/Pt bilayers is the THE.

Before the discussion of the possible THE, we should elucidate whether the
non-zero XY in the MnxGa/Pt bilayers was described in the strong (adiabatic
approximation) or weak coupling (non-adiabatic approximation) regime. In this work,
we use the model developed by Nakazawa et al. [12, 22], which considers three
regimes depending on the strength of the exchange coupling. The three regimes
correspond to different conditions between several important system parameters, such
as the characteristic length scale of the chiral spin structures q 1 , the electron mean

. Here, m* is the effective electron mass, R0 is the ordinary Hall

coefficient [18], J is the exchange coupling constant. The spin-resolved band
structures of L10-MnGa without SOC have been calculated using first-principle
5

calculations [18], and we can get EF =5.2712 eV, m*  0.65m0 , J=1.1eV ,
kF =0.121nm1 . Then, we can get the corresponding constant of the Mn1.55Ga/Pt

bilayers at 300 K, l=

indicating the spin of the conduction electrons can adiabatically follow the
surrounding local magnetization. Therefore, the additional Hall signals can be written
as XY  PR0 Beff  PR0 nT0 , where P is the spin polarization of charge carriers
and determined to be 20% according to the band structures, Beff the ﬁctitious
magnetic ﬁeld, 0  h e the ﬂux quantum, and nT the density of chiral spin
structures [2]. Then the nT of the Mn1.55Ga/Pt bilayers at 300 K is calculated to be
75 m-2, the separation of the chiral spin structures is ( (nT )1/2 ) is ~115 nm.
Obviously, it reveals large discrepancy as compared with the MFM results, indicating
the AHE in MnxGa/Pt bilayers should be much more involved.
Large discrepancy between MFM and transport features has also been found at
low temperatures. The magnetic field-dependent MFM, M  H and XY  H
curves of the Mn1.55Ga/Pt bilayers at 3.5 K have been compared as shown in Fig. 4 to
gain more insight into the nature of the spin structures and transport features. The
magnetization is almost fully aligned in the positive magnetic field direction with
H=5 T and XY is suppressed as shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b) respectively, and the
MFM image shows a homogeneous red contrast as shown in Fig. 4(c). The XY
firstly decreased from zero to negative values with sweeping the magnetic field from
positive. Although the MFM image is almost the same between 5 T and 2 T, the value
of XY is obviously non-zero at 2 T. At remanent state, the MFM image shows
obscure worm-like conﬁgurations in the so-called labyrinthine state. As H decreases
further towards large negative values -0.5 T, the worm-like or the long stripes patterns
become clear, among which several bubble-like magnetic domains have emerged.
With further decreasing the magnetic field to -1.0 T that is at around the coercivity,
many isolated bubble-like magnetic domains in a typical size of ∼50-200 nm have
been observed, while the value of XY has approached to be zero. By the way, the
6

same MFM measurements have also been carried out in the Mn1.55Ga/Al bilayers at
3.5 K [18]. A similar magnetic field-dependent MFM result has also been found in the
Mn1.55Ga/Al bilayers, while there are no bump/dip features of Hall signals [18]. It
reveals that the magnetic bubbles, in the form of up-magnetized domains in a
down-magnetized background of a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy MnxGa films,
are considered to be stabilized by magnetic dipole interactions, which should be
achiral. Therefore, the THE which is the hallmark of chiral spin structures is unlikely
to be the origin of the bump/dip features of Hall signals in the MnxGa/Pt bilayers.
Although the THE signal arises from the chiral spin structures in magnetic multilayers,
we note that the appearance of the bump/dip features of Hall signals alone is not an
unambiguous evidence. In the following discussion, the additional Hall signals in the
MnxGa/Pt bilayers have been termed as UAHE, which should be strongly related to
the strong interfacial SOC.
To further investigate the modified interfacial properties, the Mn 2p
x-ray-absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra were recorded at room temperatures in
the Total Electron Yield (TEY) mode by measuring the drain current of the
electrically isolated sample as shown in Fig. 5(a). The XAS spectra of Mn atoms
should mainly come from the interfaces, since it is well known that the TEY detection
is characterised by a probing depth lower than 5 nm (The Al and Pt layers are all
5-nm-thick), and the number of electrons that reach the surface decays exponentially
as a function of the depth of the photon absorption. In the spectra of the two bilayers,
a sharp peak structure and a doublet structure are observed in the Mn 2p3/2 (L3) and
2p1/2 (L2) core excitation regions, respectively. In addition, some more evident
shoulder structures are found on the larger energy side of the 2p3/2 component in the
Mn1.25Ga/Pt bilayers, which is a characteristic of primarily d5 with some d6 ground
states [27, 28]. The distinctly split structure of the 2p1/2 component has also been
found, and it is similar with antiferromagnetic MnPt films, where the 3d orbitals of
Mn are more localized [29]. It indicates a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the coordination on
the electronic structure of Mn d states at the interface of the MnxGa/Pt bilayers.
Though the Pt has high spin susceptibility originating from the large stoner exchange
parameter, a very small magnetic moment in Pt is considered to be induced at the
interfaces [30]. However, the magnetic ground state of Mn is antiferromagnetic, and a
large negative nearest-neighbor exchange interaction has been theoretically confirmed
by Belabbes et al [30]. Therefore, the interfacial ferromagnetic states of MnxGa will
7

be tremendously modified by the 3d-5d orbital hybridization, leading to a
combination of ferromagnetism and the antiferromagnetism at the interface.
Consequently, the evolution of the electronic structure due to modulated magnetic
states at the interfaces will generate significant momentum-space Berry phase
contributions to the AHE at finite temperature. At high magnetic field, only the
ferromagnetism will be induced and dominate the AHE. As the magnetic field
decreases, the antiferromagnetism becomes increasingly evident and results in a
modifed momentum-space Berry curvature at the interface. This also explains why the
largest UAHE have been found at around zero magnetic field, where the
antiferromagnetism may be the strongest. The phenomenon may also depend on the
surface roughness of MnxGa, since the largest UAHE has been found for x=1.0, which
also shows the largest surface roughness [18]. The increased surface roughness may
decrease the directional arrangement of magentic moment of MnxGa and assist the
emergence of antiferromagnetism. Furthermore, the formation of long range
skyrmions lattices at the interfaces can be prevented by large surface roughness, since
it may enhance the magnetic dipole energy which will dominate the interfacial DMI
and favors achiral Bloch walls [31, 32], although it has been theoretically proved that
the spin-ﬂip excitations through SOC in half-ﬁlled or high spin 3d overlayer (Mn)
make the largest contribution to DMI [30]. For further physical insight, we shows the
max
temperature dependence of the largest additional Hall conductivity  XY
which is
max
2
defined as XY
, as shown in Fig. 5(b). Phenomenological reasoning suggests
/ XX

max
that the longitudinal conductance increases with decreasing temperature while  XY

remains almost constant at high temperature regime which should stem from the
intrinsic contributions (momentum-space Berry curvatures). In the low temperature
max
limit,  XY
reveals a sharp decrease to large negative values. We have plotted the

max
/ dT 2 and d 2 / dT 2 as shown in Fig. 5(c),
temperature dependence of d 2  XY

which show sharp variations at almost the same temperature (50 K). Notably, the
aforementioned skew scattering contribution dominates the AHE in the low
temperature limit as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, the sign change of UAHE should be
related to the skew scattering due to the emergence of strong interfacial SOC, which
depends on the distribution, the type and the density of impurities [30-32]. Since the
sign of the skew scattering contribution changes when that of the scattering potential
8

is reversed, the impurity potential is considered to be modified through the emergence
of antiferromagnetic states at around zero magnetic fields. Further theoretical work is
necessary to accurately describe this complex correlation of UAHE and 3d-5d orbital
hybridization in the FM/HM bilayers.
Finally, we want to mention another role of the strong interfacial SOC introduced
by Pt. It is known that, in materials with heavy elements, the band inversion can be
induced since the strong SOC can split the p band by a large enough magnitude to flip
the s-p band structure, leading to a topological insulator [33]. The inverted bulk band
structure will topologically give rise to metallic surface states, which have a nearly
linear energy-momentum relationship. Interestingly, the topological surface states also
exist on the surface of Weyl metals, in which the bulk bands are gapped by SOC in
the momentum space except at Weyl or Dirac nodes. In the case of the MnxGa/Pt
bilayers, we also suppose the emergence of Weyl metallic features at the interfaces,
which may explain the positive MR in the low temperature limit as shown in Fig. 1.
The chiral anomaly is predicted to occur in Weyl metals since the conservation of
chiral charges is violated in the case of a parallel magnetic and electric field, resulting
in a negative longitudinal MR [34, 35]. It suggest that there is a current along the
magnetic field arising from the unequal occupation of left and right moving chiral
modes, giving a current of jc  BE  B , where E and B is the external electric
and magnetic field respectively [34, 35]. Then the electric currents measured in a thin
ﬁlm with chiral anomaly inevitably include this additional contribution. In the case of

E //B , the total electric current should be the largest and the resistance is the smallest.
Fig. 5(d) shows the angular dependence of the

 θ     0

in the

Mn1.25Ga/Pt and Mn1.25Ga/Pt bilayers. The applied current is along X axis, and the
magnetic ﬁeld of 9 T is applied in the ZX plane with angle  relative to the Z axis.
We have observed the decrease of  XX  θ    XX  0   in the Mn1.25Ga/Al bilayers as
increasing  reflecting the anisotropic magnetoresistance of the single Mn1.25Ga layer
as shown in our previous work [36]. However, the value in the Mn1.25Ga/Pt bilayers
have been enhanced with increasingwhich is consistent with the assumption that
there is an additional electric current in the Mn1.25Ga/Pt bilayers and it is the largest
when E //B . Therefore, these transport features may be related to the Weyl fermions
at the MnxGa/Pt interfaces. Recent theory and experiments have suggested that the
9

Weyl fermions with broken time-reversal symmetry were also expected to generate
strong intrinsic AHE [37, 38], which may also contribute to the UAHE in the low
temperature limit. However, the transport properties of our bilayer systems are more
complicated since bulk Pt, bulk MnxGa and MnxGa/Pt interfaces will all contribute to
the transport features [18]. Other mechanisms including orbital magnetoresistance are
hard to be distinguished [39]. It would be interesting to verify the possibility of
interface-driven Weyl fermions in future studies.
In conclusion, we have discussed the origin of interface-driven UAHE in the
MnxGa/Pt bilayers, which was distinguished from the THE related to chiral spin
structures. Low temperature MFM results indicate that the additional Hall signals as a
function of magnetic field does not peak near the maximal density of magnetic
bubbles. We firmly demonstrates that the bump/dip features of Hall signals in
FM/HM heterostructures cannot be taken as an unambiguous signature for chiral spin
structures, and it should be treated discreetly since a wealth of underlying and
interesting physics are often regrettably missed. It further demonstrates that an
extraordinary range of unanticipated phenomena is expected to emerge from the
interfaces, exciting new scientific results and functionality for future research.
