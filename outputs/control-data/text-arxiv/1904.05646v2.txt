ABSTRACT

I use a sample of more than 120,000 stars in the solar neighbourhood with parallaxes,
magnitudes and colours estimated with unprecedented accuracy by the second data
release of the Gaia mission to derive the initial mass function of the Galactic disc. A
full-forward technique is used to take into account for the population of unresolved
binaries, the metallicity distribution, the star formation history and their variation
across the Galactic disk as well as all the observational effects. The shape of the
initial mass function is well represented by a segmented power-law with two breaks at
characteristic masses. It has a maximum at M ∼ 0.15 M⊙ with significant flattening
(possibly a depletion) at lower masses and a slope of α = −1.34 ± 0.07 in the range
0.25 < M/M⊙ < 1. Above 1 M⊙ the IMF shows an abrupt decline with a slope ranging
from α = −2.68 ± 0.09 to α = −2.41 ± 0.11 depending on the adopted resolution of
the star formation history.

INTRODUCTION

The observational measure of the relative fraction of stars
according to their stellar masses Ψ ≡ dN/dM is a longstanding challenge in stellar astrophysics. In particular, the
distribution of stellar masses at birth (the so-called ”initial mass function”; hereafter IMF) is a key ingredient in
all stellar population synthesis and dynamical simulations
of galaxies and clusters (Romano, Tosi, & Matteucci 2006;
Lamers, Baumgardt, & Gieles 2013), it determines the stellar mass-to-light ratio (Courteau et al. 2014) and it has a
deep relevance in the understanding of the star formation
process (Silk 1977).
In spite of the extensive effort made by many groups,
it is still not clear if the IMF is Universal or whether
it depends on some physical parameter (Kroupa 2001;
Bastian, Covey, & Meyer 2010; Jeřábková et al. 2018, and
references therein). Among the various theories of star formation developed so far, two main models provide detailed
predictions on the shape and dependence of the IMF on
environmental parameters. The first predicts that the IMF
is the result of the joint effect of fragmentation and competitive accretion in a clustered environment (Larson 1978;
Bonnell et al. 2001; Hennebelle & Chabrier 2008). The

fragmentation of the molecular cloud has a mass-dependent
efficiency which scales with the Jeans mass. The value of
this critical mass depends on the mean molecular weight
and on the density of the gas in a complex way depending
on the relative efficiency of several complex processes such
as e.g. cosmic-rays/photoelectric heating, C/O collisional
excitation, dust cooling, etc (Larson 1998; Jappsen et al.
2005; Chabrier, Hennebelle, & Charlot 2014). This implies
a dependence of the IMF on the chemical composition and
on the original structure of the cloud. In the second theory,
stars self-regulate their masses balancing the accretion rate
and feedback (Adams & Fatuzzo 1996). Because of the
existence of complex substructures in molecular clouds, it
is not possible to define a single characteristic mass and the
shape of the IMF is determined by the superposition of the
stochastic distributions of many parameters (sound speed,
rotation rate, etc.). Also in this case, both the accretion
rate and the stellar feedback have a metallicity dependence
because of their effect on the sound speed and on the
radiation/matter coupling (Adams & Laughlin 1996).
On the other hand, observational evidence has provided
controversial results so far (Zakharova 1989; Kroupa 2002;
Portinari et al. 2004; Ballero, Kroupa, & Matteucci 2007;
Hoversten & Glazebrook 2008; van Dokkum & Conroy
2010; Hennebelle 2012; Geha et al. 2013; Dib 2014;
El-Badry, Weisz, & Quataert 2017).

Both stellar and dynamical evolution modify the IMF
at its extremes: massive stars evolve faster than low-mass
ones, so the present-day mass function (PDMF) contains
only those stars born within a time interval shorter than
their evolutionary timescales. The PDMF is therefore depleted in high-mass stars with respect to the IMF by an
amount that depends on the star formation history (SFH) of
the considered stellar system (Schroeder 1998). On the other
hand, in stellar systems where a significant number of longrange interactions occurred, the tendency toward kinetic energy equipartition leads low-mass stars to gain orbital energy
more efficiently than massive ones, possibly reaching the
critical energy needed to escape (Spitzer 1940). The characteristic timescale over which a significant exchange of kinetic
energy among stars occurs is the half-mass relaxation time
(trh ). As time passes and tage >> trh , the mass function
(MF) is progressively depleted at its low-mass end. So, the
MF observed today differs from the IMF.
The most intuitive and straightforward technique to derive the PDMF is based on the conversion of the luminosity (absolute magnitude) distribution of the Main Sequence
(MS) stars into masses through the comparison with theoretical isochrones (Limber 1960). This evolutionary sequence
does indeed define a locus where stars of different masses
spend the majority of their lives with luminosities mainly depending on their masses (Demarque & Mengel 1973). From
an observational point of view, this task is complicated by
many factors introducing significant uncertainties.
First, the derivation of absolute magnitudes implies the
knowledge of stellar distances. Distances of stellar systems
can be derived with relatively good accuracy using different
techniques based on the magnitudes of standard candles such
as pulsating variables, binaries and stars at the tip of the Red
Giant Branch (Lacy 1978; Bellazzini, Ferraro, & Pancino
2001; Sollima, Cacciari, & Valenti 2006). The situation is
however more complex for individual stars in the Galactic
field which are displaced across two orders of magnitudes
in distance. Until recent years, geometric techniques such
as trigonometric parallaxes were effective in measuring distances only until a few tens of pc from the Sun with errors as
large as 10% (ESA 1997). Because the completeness of the
observational sample depends on the apparent magnitude,
bright/massive stars are over-represented in a magnitudelimited sample and a suitable correction accounting for the
spatial distribution of stars with different masses is necessary (Miller & Scalo 1979).
Furthermore, the color and magnitude of MS stars also
depend, beside mass, on chemical composition. Therefore,
in stellar systems containing stars with different metallicities (such as the Milky Way and galaxies in general) stars
with different masses overlap across the MS. The metallicity
distribution and star formation rate (SFR) change with the
height above the Galactic disk because of the dependence of
the chemical enrichment efficiency on the density, the long
term dynamical evolution and the increasing contamination
of the thick disc (Wang et al. 2019).
Moreover, unresolved multiple systems are observed
with luminosities resulting from the sum of the luminosities of their individual components and therefore have magnitudes brighter than those of single stars. Many low-mass
stars are secondary components of binary systems and are
therefore hidden (Kroupa, Tout, & Gilmore 1991).

Finally, the extinction varies across the sky according to
the column density of the dust interposed between the observer and the stars, making them appear redder and fainter
than they are. Stellar systems at large distances cover a small
area in the sky and intersect a constant dust density and are
therefore subject to a relatively homogeneous extinction. Instead, stars in the Galactic disc are characterized by a variable extinction depending on their Galactic latitudes and
heliocentric distances (Drimmel & Spergel 2001).
For these reasons, clusters and associations, formed
by thousand of stars with similar ages and chemical composition, lying at the same distance and subject to the
same extinction, are ideal benchmarks for this purpose. Unfortunately, globular and massive open clusters, the closest clusters for which the MF can be determined down
to the hydrogen-burning limit with a good statistics and
level of completeness, are always older than their typical half-mass relaxation time. Their PDMFs are therefore not representative of their IMFs (Moraux & Bouvier
2012; Sollima & Baumgardt 2017). Young massive clusters (with ages < 100 Myr and M > 105 M⊙ ) are
all located in starburst galaxies at distances > 1 M pc
(Portegies Zwart, McMillan, & Gieles 2010). Because they
are compact and distant, it is possible to resolve only a
few bright stars even with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) (Weisz et al. 2013, and references therein). The measure of the MF in the galaxies of the Local Volume, while
requiring a careful treatment of their metallicity distributions, has become feasible in recent years thanks to
HST only for the Magellanic Clouds and the closest Ultra faint dwarfs. In these galaxies, it has been possible to
sample the MF down to a limiting mass of ∼ 0.4 M⊙
(Gouliermis, Brandner, & Henning 2006; Kalirai et al. 2013;
Gennaro et al. 2018a). Most of the information on the IMF
comes from the associations and star forming regions. Studies conducted in the nearby associations suggest an average
power-law slope α ∼ −2.3 (Scalo 1998; Kroupa 2001) although notable examples of clusters with flatter (such as
the Arches and Quintuplet clusters; −1.9 < α < −1.7;
Shin & Kim 2016) or steeper (e.g. NGC 6611; α ∼ −3; Dib
2014) MFs exist.
The solar neighbourhood is also a privileged site to
study the IMF. Indeed, the IMF modification due to collisional effects in the Galactic disc is negligible and thousand of stars are observable in the solar vicinity. On the
other hand, the lack of accurate distances limited the analysis to a small sample of nearby stars. In his pioneering
work, Salpeter (1955) converted the luminosity function
of the sample available at that time into the MF adopting a constant star formation rate and neglecting the density/age/metallicity variation across the disc and the effect
of binaries. This work showed that the IMF is well represented by a single power-law Ψ ∝ M α with index α = −2.35
over the range 0.4 < M/M⊙ < 10. In a following study,
Miller & Scalo (1979) applied the same technique to an updated luminosity function, adopting a correction for the spatial distribution of stars with different spectral types and
assuming three simplified SFHs. They found that the IMF
is only weakly dependent on the SFH and provided different
analytical fitting functions. Their IMF steepens at increasing masses ranging from α = −1.4 at 0.1 < M/M⊙ < 1 to
α = −2.5 at 1 < M/M⊙ < 10 and α = −3.3 at M > 10 M⊙ .
MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2019)

The IMF of the solar neighbourhood
In a series of papers (Kroupa, Tout, & Gilmore 1991, 1993;
Kroupa 1995, 2001, 2002) Kroupa and collaborators refined
the analysis simulating the effect of a population of unresolved binaries. By summarizing their IMF determinations
in the Galactic disc and in young clusters they defined a
broken power-law with index α = −0.3 in the substellar
regime (M < 0.08 M⊙ ), α = −1.3 at 0.1 < M/M⊙ < 0.5
and α = −2.3 at M > 0.5 M⊙ . Chabrier (2001, 2003a)
used a volume-limited sample of stars with known parallaxes cleaned from binaries to derive a log-normal IMF which
smoothly covers a wide range of slopes from α ∼ −1.1
at 0.1 M⊙ to α ∼ −2.9 at M = 10 M⊙ . The existence
of peaks and breaks in the IMF is relevant in the context
of star formation theories since it determines the existence
of characteristic masses where the efficiencies of some of
the physical processes involved might have threshold effects
(Bonnell, Clarke, & Bate 2006). In spite of the different observational samples and functional representations, all the
quoted studies converged in defining an IMF slope close to
α = −2.3 at M > 1 M⊙ and a flatter slope at low masses.
In recent years, several works tried to recover the IMF of
the solar neighbourhood using the sample of stars with
trigonometric parallaxes provided by the Hipparcos mission
(Dawson & Schröder 2010; Rybizki & Just 2015) or through
a best fit of the colour-magnitude diagram obtained from
the Tycho-2 mission with synthetic stellar population models of the Milky Way (Czekaj et al. 2014; Mor et al. 2018).
All these studies measured MF slopes which all agree in the
sub-solar regime with the previous determinations but are
significantly steeper (α < −2.8) at larger masses. Unfortunately, all the above mentioned studies suffer from either
the relatively small statistics and the large uncertainties of
Hipparcos parallaxes or from the uncertainties on the distribution of stars across the disc.
A revolution in the inventory of the solar neighbourhood is provided by the Gaia astrometric mission
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). In particular, the 2nd data
release of Gaia listed positions, parallaxes and proper motions for ∼ 1.3 × 109 stars across the entire sky with accuracies down to 20 µas and magnitudes and colors with mmag
accuracies down to relatively faint magnitudes (G < 20.7).
Recently, Mor et al. (2019) used Gaia DR2 magnitudes
and parallaxes to derive the SFH of the solar neighbourhood. As a byproduct, they constrained the IMF using a
three-segment power-law with breaks at fixed masses at 0.5
M⊙ and 1.53 M⊙ . Their best fit slopes appear to depend on
the functional form of the SFH, with α=-1.4 and -2.5 in the
mass ranges below/above 0.5 M⊙ assuming an exponential
SFH, and α=-1.3 and -1.9 when leaving the SFH free to vary
without a pre-imposed parametric shape. While extremely
valuable, this work was not focussed on the MF determination so that the limited flexibility of their MF does not allow
to draw conclusions on its detailed shape.
In this paper, I use the Hertzprung-Russel diagram of
the solar neihbourhood provided by Gaia to derive the IMF
of this portion of the Galactic disc. In Sect. 2 the adopted
selection criteria applied to the global Gaia catalog to define the sample of solar neighbourhood stars are presented.
The algorithms to determine the IMF in two different mass
regimes are described in Sect.s 3 and 4, respectively. The
derived IMF is compared with those estimated by previous works and with those measured in other dynamically

SAMPLE SELECTION

The analysis presented here is entirely based on data
from the second data release of the Gaia mission
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). The Gaia catalog contains
magnitudes in the G, GBP and GRP bands, parallaxes (p)
and proper motions (µ∗RA , µDec ) for ∼ 1.3 × 109 stars in
both hemispheres.
Crucial information for the purpose of this work is the
catalog completeness. Stars are included in the Gaia catalog if they are successfully tracked on the focal plane of
the Gaia sky mapper in at least five transits and the resulting astrometric solution has an astrometric excess noise
and semi-major axis of the position uncertainty ellipse lower
than 20 and 100 mas, respectively (Lindegren et al. 2018).
According to the Gaia team the catalog is ”essentially complete between 12 < G < 17” while ”a fraction of stars
brighter than G < 7 are missing in the data release”
with ”an ill-defined faint limiting magnitude” (Arenou et al.
2018). Given the complex Gaia selection function, an estimate of the catalog completeness can be only made through
the comparison with other surveys (Marrese et al. 2019).
An attempt in this direction was made by Lindegren et al.
(2018) who derived the fraction of stars in the OGLE fields
(Udalski, Szymanski, Soszynski & Poleski 2008) sampled by
Gaia DR2 to be ∼100% at G=18 and >95% at G=20 in
the Galactic disk. However, as reported in Lindegren et al.
(2018), OGLE has a similar limiting magnitude and a poorer
spatial resolution than Gaia so that such a comparison provides only an upper limit to the Gaia completeness.
To derive a conservative estimate, I retrieved the positions and magnitudes from the Gaia archive1 in 180 regions evenly distributed in the sky covering 3 sq. deg. each
and cross-correlated them with i) the 2nd data release of
the 3π Pan-STARRS catalog (PS1; Flewelling 2018), and ii)
the 2Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006).
The PS1 catalog covers 3π steradians and is complete down
to g ∼ 23.3 (corresponding to a range in Gaia G magnitude
between 21.3 and 23.9 depending on the spectral type) i.e.
well below the Gaia limiting magnitude. As most of the catalog samples the Galactic field, crowding is negligible and
the limiting magnitude is set by the photon noise. Therefore, this catalog can be considered suitable to estimate the
Gaia completeness at faint magnitudes. On the other hand,
at magnitudes brighter than G < 14 the PS1 catalog suffers from photometric saturation, containing many spurious detections surrounding bright stars. In this magnitude
range the 2MASS catalog is a valid complement since it is
based on shallow infrared photometry and is complete up to
very bright magnitudes. To match the three catalogues, stars
within 1′′ were associated and used to construct a colour dependent transformation between the PS1 g and 2MASS K
magnitudes into Gaia G magnitudes. Stars with a magnitude
difference ∆ G > 0.75 mag were considered false matches
and rejected. The fraction of sources contained in the Gaia

catalog as a function of G magnitude is shown in the left
panel of Fig. 1. The curves calculated from the comparison
with the two reference catalogs nicely match in the interval 14 < G < 16. The average fraction of recovered stars is
found to be > 90% in the range 7.5 < G < 18 with a sudden
drop at fainter magnitudes. At bright magnitudes such a
fraction shows large variations across the sky with a strong
dependence on Galactic latitude. It should be noted that,
at low latitudes, most of the incompleteness is caused by
the high extinction produced by dust clouds in the Galactic disc, whose density linearly increases with heliocentric
distance. This effect is expected to be relatively low in our
analysis, which is restricted to the solar neighbourhood. So,
the curve shown in Fig. 1 is likely to be a lower limit to the
actual completeness of Gaia. On the basis of these considerations, I selected only stars in the range 7.5 < G < 18
and do not apply any correction to the derived star counts.
Of course, the adoption of magnitude cuts creates a bias in
the volume-completeness of stars with different magnitudes,
with the faint (bright) stars being under-represented at large
(small) distances. This effect must be taken into account in
the derivation of the MF (see Sect. 3.1 and 4.1).
I retrieved from the Gaia archive all stars with measured magnitudes and parallaxes and applied a quality cut
based on the parameters astrometric chi2 al (χ2 ) and

This selection was proven to be effective in removing
astrometric artifacts while preserving the completeness of
real stars (Arenou et al. 2018).
Gaia is able to resolve binaries with angular separations > 0.4′′ (Arenou et al. 2018), corresponding to a physical separation > 30 AU at 50 pc. This means that most of
the binaries in our sample are unresolved.

as a function of their position in the p − sin b diagram.
The above relation, while neglecting small scale variations
within the considered volume, well interpolates the reddening map recently obtained by Lallement et al. (2019)
(∆E(B − V ) = 0.003 ± 0.017).
Different samples were selected to derive the MF in different mass regimes, which require different treatments:
• A sample of nearby (p > 20 mas) MS stars with MG >
4 to study the MF in the low-mass (M < 1 M⊙ ) regime
(hereafter referred as nearby sample). In this distance range,
a star at the hydrogen-burning limit with a solar metallicity
(with MG ∼ 15.5) has an apparent magnitude G < 18, so
this sample contains almost all the low-mass stars contained
in this distance range;
• A sample of bright (MG < 4) stars in a cylinder centred
on the Sun with a radius R ≡ cos(b)/p < 200 pc and height
above the Galactic plane |Z| ≡ |sin(b)/p + Z⊙ | < 390 pc,
to study the MF in the high-mass (M > 1 M⊙ ) regime
(hereafter referred as bright sample).
The R and Z limits of the bright sample were specifically
chosen to avoid nearby dust clouds (Lallement et al. 2019).
In particular, all the stars within the selected volume nicely
lie along the relation defined in eq. 2 reaching a maximum
extinction of E(B − V ) < 0.035.
I do not apply any correction for the systematic parallax offset reported by Lindegren et al. (2018). These authors
quantify this systematic shift to be ∼-0.05 mas at parallaxes <2.8 mas and not clearly measurable at large values,
with local regional variations depending on colour and magnitude. According to Arenou et al. (2018) ”in absence of a
large number of calibrators homogeneously spread across the
sky in this parallax range, it is not advisable to correct it
using a simple shift”. Note that, even in the worst case, such
an offset would be negligible (<2%) in the nearby sample,
while it would be partly absorbed by the calibration of the
vertical distribution of stars in the bright sample (see Sect.
4).
The value of the solar height above the Galactic plane
was set as the mode of the Z distribution of nearby sample
stars at Z⊙ = 1.4 ± 0.1 pc, which falls between the estimates
by Bovy (2017, −0.9±0.9 pc) and Karim & Mamajek (2017,
17 ± 5 pc). Given the vertical extent of our sample, the value
of Z⊙ is relevant only for the nearby sample. On the other
hand, small variations in Z⊙ do not produce sizeable effects
in the analysis.
To avoid domination by the contribution of individual star clusters located inside the analysed regions, I excluded from the sample the stars belonging to two nearby
open clusters (Hyades, Pleiades) and those of two other
extended coherent groups not previously identified (at
(RA,Dec,p)=(185, -56, 9.2 mas) and (RA,Dec,p)=(-23, 245,
7.3 mas)). These clusters were identified on the basis of their
clustering in the 5D space of positions, proper motions and
parallax: a star is considered a cluster member if the local

range covered by the considered samples, the maximum difference
between the two functional forms is ∆E(B − V ) < 0.0015, much
smaller than the typical colour uncertainties.

density is 3σ above the background defined by the stars in
the surrounding portion of this space. Consider that, in the
generally accepted scenario, the large majority (maybe all)
of the field stars form in clusters and associations quickly dissolved after a few Myr. Therefore, regardless of their clustering in phase-space, all the stars of the solar neighbourhood
were likely part of a stellar complex at their birth. The selection made here is intended to exclude only the contribution
of the largest clusters. Note that these clusters contain only
a small fraction of the stars in the considered samples (∼1%
of the nearby sample and <0.1% of the bright sample), so
that the results do not depend on this choice.
After applying the above defined selection criteria, the
nearby and the bright samples contain 27048 and 120724
stars, respectively, The number density of the stars belonging to the two samples at various positions in the sky are
also shown in the right panels of Fig. 1. Stars nicely follow
the expected distribution for the considered sample volumes
with no apparent patches, excluding a significant positiondependent sampling efficiency due e.g. to the Gaia scanning
law.
In the next two sections I will describe the methods
adopted to derive the IMF in the two above defined mass
regimes.

from a MF defined in 20 evenly-spaced mass intervals of
0.045 M⊙ width, from 0.1 to 1 M⊙ . The relative fraction of
stars in each mass bin (mi ) is set by 20 coefficients (ki )
For a given MF, synthetic absolute magnitudes and
colours were derived by interpolating through the set of
isochrones of the MESA database (Choi et al. 2016) adopting an age of 10 Gyr. This choice is justified by the
fact that the nearby sample is formed by MS stars below the turn-off. In the assumption of a constant star formation rate, 98% of them are older than 200 Myr i.e.
the timescale needed by a 0.2 M⊙ star to end its preMS phase (Tognelli, Prada Moroni, & Degl’Innocenti 2011).
Under these conditions, evolutionary effects are negligible
and single-age old isochrones properly reproduce the massluminosity relation of these stars.
The metallicity distribution was modelled as an asymmetric gaussian with mode [Fe/H]=0 and a standard deviation of the metal-poor tail σF e,low = 0.2 dex, while the

standard deviation of the metal-rich tail σF e,hi was left as
a free parameter. This model provides the best fit to the
colour distribution of the nearby sample and agrees with the
metallicity distribution derived by the spectroscopic analysis
of 4666 stars in the solar neighbourhood by Mikolaitis et al.
(2017).
Synthetic particles were distributed at different heights
above the Galactic plane following a gaussian distribution
with σZ = 147 pc and homogeneously along the direction
parallel to the Galactic plane over a volume twice larger
than that defined for the nearby sample. The value of σZ
was chosen as the one maximizing the log-likelihood

and its associated error of the i-th star, rmax = 50 pc and
Z⊙ = 1.4 pc (see Sect. 2).
The population of binaries was simulated by random
pairing a fraction fb of synthetic stars whose fluxes in the
G, GBP and GRP passbands were summed.
The dereddened colours and absolute magnitudes of
synthetic particles were converted into apparent ones by inverting eq. 1 and a real star with G magnitude within 0.25
mag was associated to each synthetic particle. A gaussian
shift in colour, magnitude and parallax with standard deviation equal to the uncertainty of the associated star in
the corresponding quantity was then added defining an ”observational” set of synthetic apparent magnitudes and parallaxes. Stars with ”observational” magnitudes and parallaxes outside the adopted cuts (see Sect. 2) were rejected.
The ”observational” absolute magnitude of synthetic stars
was then re-computed using eq. 1. The above task mimics the effect of photometric and astrometric errors and ensures a proper treatment of the asymmetric distance error
(Luri et al. 2018).
For an assumed binary fraction, an iterative algorithm
was used to determine the best fit MF. At the first iteration, guess values of the coefficients ki ∝ m−2.35
and of
i
σF e,hi = 0.2 dex were adopted. The (GBP − GRP ) − MG
CMD was divided in 20 bins defined to include stars lying
in a colour range within 3σ about the MS ridge line and at
magnitudes corresponding to the mass range of the same 20
bins defining the MF (see above) on a 10 Gyr-old isochrone
with solar metallicity. An additional sample of stars with
colours redder than 3σ with respect to the MS mean ridge
line was defined to include unresolved binary systems (see
Fig 2). The number of nearby sample stars (Nobs,i ) and synthetic particles (Nsynth,i ) contained in each bin were counted
and the coefficients ki were updated using the following correction

The value of σF e,hi was also updated, by increasing (decreasing) its value by 0.005 dex if the fraction of nearby sample stars contained in the binary region was larger (smaller)
than that in the synthetic CMD. The above procedure was
repeated until convergence, providing for each choice of fb
a set of best fit coefficients ki . The difference between the

so that ∆G /∆BR = σG /σBR ∼ 2 where σG and σBR are the
standard deviations of magnitude and colour in the nearby
sample. The comparison between the CMD and G-band luminosity function of the nearby sample and those of the best
fit synthetic model is shown in Fig. 3.
Uncertainties were estimated through a Monte Carlo
technique: at each step a synthetic CMD containing the
same number of stars of the nearby sample was simulated
assuming the best fit MF, metallicity distribution and binary fraction and its MF was estimated in the same fashion
as for real data. The r.m.s of the MFs of 104 different simulations were adopted as the corresponding uncertainties. This
procedure takes into account the effect of Poisson noise but
does not include the effect of all the systematics (e.g. uncertainties in isochrones, mass-ratio distribution of binaries,
spatial distribution, limiting magnitude, etc.).

Results

The best fit MFs for different adopted binary fractions and
their corresponding values of ξ are shown in the left panel
of Fig. 4. It is apparent that the slope of the MF in the
mass range 0.25 < M/M⊙ < 1 is almost independent on the
adopted binary fraction, being nicely fit by a single powerlaw with an index ranging from α = −1.38 to -1.16 for
10% < fb < 60%, and a best fit value of α = −1.34 ± 0.07
at fb = 25%. At lower masses the MF significantly flattens
and has a peak at M ∼ 0.15 M⊙ although its shape strongly
depends on the adopted binary fraction.
The best fit binary fraction (fb = 25%) is lower than
that measured by the long-baseline spectroscopic campaigns
performed in the past (∼ 50%; Duquennoy & Mayor 1991;
Moe & Di Stefano 2017). Note however that the fraction of
binaries estimated here is quite uncertain (ǫfb ∼ 10%) and
refers to unresolved binaries, while some of the wide binaries at small heliocentric distances are resolved by Gaia and
therefore included in the nearby sample as single stars. Moreover, the selection on astrometric quality described in Sect. 2
can potentially exclude those binaries for which the relative
motion of their components alters the position measured by
Gaia, thus worsening the quality of the fit (see below). The
corresponding metallicity dispersion on the metal-rich side
turns out to be σF e,hi = 0.13 dex, in agreement with the
result by Mikolaitis et al. (2017).

assumptions made in the analysis, I repeated the above procedure i) using the isochrones from the PARSEC database
(Bressan et al. 2012), ii) assuming a limiting magnitude of
G < 15, and iii) removing the quality cut in the Gaia as-

trometric solution (see the right panel of Fig.4). The mean
slope of the MF does not depend on the adopted isochrones
(αP ARSEC = −1.51 ± 0.07), while some small-scale differences are apparent due to differences in the mass-luminosity
relation of these two models. For example, the steepening
at M < 0.5 M⊙ apparent when using MESA isochrones is
absent in the MF calculated using PARSEC models which
are likely spurious. Moreover, with this latter set of models,
the MF at M < 0.15 M⊙ is almost flat and does not show
any clear peak. It is also possible to fit the MF calculated
using the PARSEC isochrones in this mass range with a lognormal function with central value log (M0 /M⊙ ) = 1.06 and
σlogM = 0.44, while this analytical representation provides a
poor fit at masses M < 0.2 M⊙ when MESA isochrones are
used. The MFs in this regime derived using the two sets of
models mentioned above are listed in Table 1. No significant
differences are noticeable by either changing the adopted
limiting magnitude or removing the selection on astrometric
quality, indicating that the completeness at 15 < G < 18 is
still high and that the fraction of artifacts is small and homogeneously distributed in magnitude. It is however worth
noting that, when no selection cut on astrometric quality is
applied, the best fit is obtained with a fraction of binaries
fb = 40%, significantly higher than that obtained in the selected sample, indicating that a sizeable fraction of binaries
is rejected by the quality cut. This explains the discrepancy
between the fraction of binaries estimated here and that of
previous literature works.
Since all the stars of the solar neighbourhood in the
sub-solar mass regime did not have enough time to evolve
off the MS, and because of the non-collisional nature of the
Galactic disk, the above derived PDMF is representative of
the IMF.

4.1

HIGH-MASS REGIME
Method

At odds with the portion of CMD fainter than the turnoff point (i.e. less massive than the oldest star which exhausted hydrogen at its centre), the bright part of the CMD
is mainly populated by those stars with ages smaller than
their evolutionary timescales (see Sect. 1). In this situation
the PDMF differs from the IMF which can be estimated
only assuming a SFH. This last function can be determined
on the basis of the overall distribution of stars in the CMD
(Robin, Creze, & Mohan 1989).
For this purpose I simulated the CMD of the bright sample as the superposition of stellar populations with different
ages. The number and width of the age bins determining the
resolution of the derived SFH should be chosen as a compromise to ensure flexibility while limiting the degeneracy
caused by the increasing number of free parameters. Two
cases were considered: i) a low-resolution SFH defined by 4
stellar populations (with ages log t/yr < 9, 9 < log t/yr <
9.5, 9.5 < log t/yr < 9.9 and 9.9 < log t/yr < 10) and
ii) a high-resolution SFH defined by 10 stellar populations
with ages evenly spaced from 0 to 10 Gyr with a width of 1
Gyr. Within each age bin, star ages were randomly extracted
so that they evenly populate the bin. The age upper limit
was chosen from the comparison between the lower envelope
of the Subgiant Branch observed in the CMD of the bright
sample with the MESA isochrone with suitable metallicity
(see below).
It is well known that stars at different heights above
the Galactic plane have different ages and metallicity distributions. This is a consequence of the dependence of the
star formation efficiency on the density, on the secular evolution of the vertical distribution of stars and of the increasing
contamination of the thick disc (see Sect. 1). To account for
these effects the vertical variations of the age and metallicity distributions were modelled. In particular, the density of
stars in each age bin was fitted with an exponential function
with scale-height hZ (t). To determine the appropriate scaleheight, a synthetic CMD assuming a constant SFR and a
Kroupa (2001) IMF3 was simulated and a selection box in
the CMD where the fraction of synthetic particles in the considered age interval is > 90% was defined. The bright sample
stars comprised within the appropriate selection box of the
dereddened colour-absolute magnitude diagram were used to
search the value of hZ which maximizes the log-likelihood

The synthetic CMD simulated in this task is used only to define

overall shape of the distribution, I relaxed this criterion only
for this task, thus including all stars brighter than G < 18.
Note that the (possible) incompleteness at bright magnitudes affects only the brightest stars in the youngest age bin
at small distances, while the fit is driven by the tails of the
distribution. Therefore, this exception is not expected to affect the final result. As expected, the best fit scale-heights
for the corresponding age bins increase with age (see Fig.
5). For each age bin, synthetic particles were distributed at
different heights above the Galactic plane according to the
corresponding distribution and homogeneously along the direction parallel to the Galactic plane over a volume twice
larger than that defined for the bright sample.
The metallicity distribution at different heights above
the Galactic plane was estimated by best-fitting the colour
distribution of MS stars (4.5 < MG < 6.5) selected from the
Gaia catalog in 4 slices at different heights h|Z|i from 50 to
350 pc with a 100 pc width. The absolute magnitudes and
dereddened GBP − GRP colours of these stars were calculated using eq.s 1 and 2. A synthetic CMD of that portion
of the CMD was simulated using the technique described
in Sect. 3.1 and the best fit binary fraction fb = 25% derived in the nearby sample (appropriated for these low-mass
stars). In each slice, the metallicity distribution was modelled as an asymmetric gaussian characterized by a mode
([F e/H]peak ) and two different standard deviations at the
two sides of the distribution (σF e,low and σF e,hi ). The values of these parameters minimizing the penalty function of
eq. 3 were chosen as representative of the considered slice. At
increasing heights above the Galactic plane, the metallicity
distribution appears to shift toward the metal-poor range
becoming more symmetric and with increasing dispersions
at both sides (see Fig. 6). It is worth noting that the derived metallicity variations are relatively small. This is not
surprising since the expected contamination from thick disc
stars is small: a comparison with the Robin et al. (2003)
model suggests that only 3.3% of the bright sample stars
should belong to the thick disc. The metallicity of each star
was then extracted by linearly interpolating through the defined distributions according to its height above the Galactic
plane. The assumptions made above naturally introduce a
height-dependent age-metallicity relation with the particles
at larger heights being on average older and more metal-poor
than those close to the Galactic plane.
The magnitudes and colours of synthetic stars were derived by interpolating through the set of MESA isochrones
of appropriate age and metallicity and assuming a broken
power-law IMF with index α = −1.34 at M < 1 M⊙ (see
Sect. 3.2) and leaving the slope in the high-mass slope as a
free parameter. Particles with ages higher than the evolutionary timescales associated to their masses and metallicities were automatically removed from the sample.
A population of binaries was also simulated by adding
to the G, GBP and GRP fluxes of a fraction fb of stars those
of companion stars with mass extracted from the distribution of mass-ratios described by Moe & Di Stefano (2017)
for A-type stars. To limit the number of free parameters, a
fixed value of fb = 50% was adopted (Duquennoy & Mayor
1991). This choice was made to account for the fast changing fraction of multiple systems found by Moe & Di Stefano
(2017) in this mass range (50%-90%) and considering that
a small fraction of binaries could be actually resolved in the

bright sample. The effect of different fractions of binaries is
tested in Sect. 4.2.
The effect of reddening, photometric and parallax errors
was simulated using the same technique described in Sect.
3.1 and particles satisfying the magnitude and positional
cuts adopted for the bright sample (see Sect. 2) are retained.
The relative fractions of stars in the age bins were estimated by matching the G-band luminosity function of MS
stars at GBP − GRP < 1 using a least-squares fitting algorithm providing the SFH. Because of the degeneracy between MF slope and SFH, it is always possible to reproduce
the luminosity function of MS stars for any choice of the
high-mass MF slope. On the other hand, the proportion of
old stellar populations is constrained by the relative fraction of evolved stars populating the red portion of the CMD
along the Red Giant Branch. The penalty function defined
in eq. 3 was calculated using all the stars in the CMD of

the bright sample and the value of the high-mass IMF slope
providing the lowest value of ξ was derived.
The uncertainty attached to the MF slope was calculated using a Monte Carlo technique (see Sect. 3.1). Although the estimated uncertainty is relatively small, the error budget is dominated by systematics. Indeed, many priors
were assumed in the above analysis each of them significantly
affecting the final estimate.
Because of the relatively bright cut adopted for our sample (G > 7.5) massive stars are poorly represented: while the
maximum mass in the best fit synthetic catalog is ∼ 10 M⊙ ,
the strongest constraint to the IMF slope is given by stars
with 1 < M/M⊙ < 2.5 which represent more than 96% of
the sample. This last interval was considered as the range of
validity of the present analysis.

Results

As a result of the procedure described in the previous section, adopting a low-resolution SFH the best fit IMF slope in
the super-solar mass regime turns out to be α = −2.68±0.09.
The best fit model to the bright sample CMD and the Gband luminosity function are shown in Fig. 7 together with
the derived SFH. The SFH is almost constant over the past
10 Gyr with a slight decrease at recent epochs, in agreement
with the results by Bernard (2018) and Mor et al. (2018)
within the uncertainties.
A significantly different result is obtained when the
high-resolution SFH is adopted. The resulting best fit CMD,
G-band luminosity function and SFH are also shown in Fig.
7. The corresponding MF turns out to be α = −2.41 ± 0.11,
significantly flatter than that derived using fewer age compoMNRAS 000, 1–20 (2019)

nents. It can be noticed that, while the general trend of the
SFH is compatible with that obtained in the low-resolution
case with an increasing star formation rate at old ages, the
SFH appears more bursty, being characterized by three intense episodes of star formation which occurred 3, 7 and 10
Gyr ago. However, given the large number of free parameters, it is not clear if such a behaviour is real or rather it is
due to the noise or to the degeneracy between the various
components.
As reported in Sect. 4.1, beside the effect of the SFH,
the results for this mass range strongly depend on the various assumptions. The strongest effect is produced by the
adopted isochrones: by repeating the analysis using PARSEC isochrones, the derived IMF slope steepens to α < −4.
This is a consequence of the different assumptions made by
these models on the overshooting in low-mass stars affecting

the time spent along the Red Giant Branch and therefore
star counts in this evolutive sequence.
The dependence of the derived MF slope as a function
of the binary fraction was checked by repeating the analysis assuming different values of fb . The high-mass MF slope
is found to mildly depends on this assumption varying by
∆α = ±0.08 for binary fractions from 30% to 70%. This
variation is of the order of the random error so that uncertainties in the prescriptions for the population of binaries
are not expected to significantly affect the MF slope in this
mass range.
The high-mass MF slope is also found to be independent
on the adopted slope at low-masses: by assuming a value
in the range −2 < α (M < 1 M⊙ ) < −0.5 the derived
slope in the high-mass range changes by ∆α < 0.01. This is
not surprising since the bright sample has been specifically

designed to contain only stars at MG < 4 where only a
few low-mass stars in the metal-poor tail of the metallicity
distribution are present.

The MF slope was also calculated without applying any
selection on the astrometric quality parameter (see Sect. 2).
In this case the slope of the MF flattens slightly, remaining
however compatible within the errors with that derived for
the selected sample.

The entire set of high-mass IMF slopes derived under
various assumptions and their associated uncertainties are
summarized in Table 2.

COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS IMF
DETERMINATIONS
Solar neighbourhood

In the top-right panels of Fig. 8 and 9 the IMF derived
in this work is compared with those provided by Salpeter
(1955), Miller & Scalo (1979), Kroupa (2001), and Chabrier
(2003b) in the two considered mass regimes, respectively.
The IMF estimated here is similar in the sub-solar regime to
those of the considered works. Moreover, for the first time, a
peak in the IMF at masses above the hydrogen-burning limit
is detected. In the super-solar regime a good agreement is
found when the high-resolution SFH is adopted, while in the
low-resolution case the IMF estimated here is significantly
steeper than that found by these authors.
A better agreement with the IMF derived adopting
the low-resolution SFH is instead found with the postHipparcos IMF determinations (bottom-right panels in Figs.
8 and 9). Dawson & Schröder (2010) estimated a MF slope
α = −2.85 ± 0.15 from a sample of Hipparcos stars with
M > 0.9 M⊙ at heliocentric distances <100 pc and within
±25 pc to the Galactic plane. Just & Jahreiß (2010) analysed the data from Hipparcos and the Catalog of Nearby
Stars (at distances <200 pc) over a mass range 0.5 <
M/M⊙ < 10. They found a broken power-law IMF with indexes α = −1.46±0.1 at M < 1.72 M⊙ and α = −4.16±0.12
at larger masses. Using the same dataset and a different prescription for the extinction law, Rybizki & Just (2015) updated these values to α = −1.49 ± 0.08 at M < 1.39 M⊙
and α = −3.02 ± 0.06 beyond this mass. Similar results
were obtained by Czekaj et al. (2014) who used the Galactic model by Robin et al. (2003) to derive α ∼ −3 over a
wide range of masses, although their sample is limited at
relatively bright magnitudes so that the constraint for stars
with masses M < 1.5 M⊙ is less stringent. Mor et al. (2018)
performed a similar comparison on the same dataset and
found α = −2.1+0.1
−0.3 in the mass range 0.5 < M/M⊙ < 1.53
and α = −2.9 ± 0.2 at larger masses (α = −3.7 ± 0.2 using
a different extinction map). Finally, Mor et al. (2019) fitted
MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2019)

the Gaia DR2 data with the Besancon model and derived a
slope α = −1.3 ± 0.3 in the mass range 0.5 < M/M⊙ < 1.53
and α = −1.9+0.1
−0.2 at larger masses. However, as in the
present analysis, their MF slopes appear to strongly depend
on the assumptions about the shape of the SFH: when they
impose an exponential SFH, the high-mass slope becomes
α = −2.5 ± 0.1. At the low-mass extreme (M < 0.5 M⊙ )
+0.5
they found positive slopes α = +0.4+0.6
−0.2 and α = +0.5−0.8
in the case of an exponential or of a non-parametric SFH,
respectively. Given the very large uncertainties in this verylow mass range, the difference with respect to our work is
not significant.
Considering that all the works quoted above adopt different assumptions for the reddening, the Galactic structure
and the adopted stellar models, there is a surprisingly good
agreement with the IMF estimated in this work.

Pleiades

As shown in Sect. 4.1, the procedure to derive the IMF in
the solar neighbourhood involves many free parameters and
suffers from significant systematic errors, in particular in the
super-solar mass regime. While this is an unavoidable situation in the Galactic field, a more robust estimate could be
made in a nearby stellar system where stars are all located at
the same distance and have similar ages and chemical compositions (see Sect. 1). Among the open clusters contained
in the volume defined for the bright sample, the Pleiades are
young and massive enough to sample a relatively wide range
of masses with a good statistics.
In this cluster, Gaia proper motions and parallaxes
allow to select member stars with an unprecedented efficiency on the basis of the distribution of stars in the 5D
space formed by projected positions, proper motions and
parallaxes. In this space the Pleiades are clustered around
a mean proper motion hµ∗RA i = 19.96 ± 0.04 mas/yr,
hµDec i = −45.51 ± 0.04 mas/yr and a mean parallax of
hpi = 7.335 ± 0.003 mas (corresponding to a distance of
136.34 ± 0.05 pc in agreement with the interferometric distance estimated by Pan, Shao, & Kulkarni 2004). The density of stars in this space was calculated using a k-neighbour
algorithm with k=10 and normalizing projected distances
and velocities to their r.m.s. Cluster members are then defined as those objects lying in a region characterized by a
density at 5σ above the average background density calculated in a portion of this space surrounding the region occupied by the bulk of cluster members. By using the above
selection criterion I selected 674 bona-fide cluster members
(see Fig. 10). To quantify the possible residual contamination from Galactic interlopers the same selection criterion
was applied to a control field selected at the same Galactic
latitude of the Pleiades and displaced by ∼ 13.5◦ in longitude: only 1 star passed the above defined criterion indicating a contamination < 0.2%. The maximum projected
density in the cluster center is < 4×10−5 arcsec−2 , so crowding effects are negligible. At the distance of the Pleiades, the
completeness cuts of Gaia correspond to masses of 0.13 M⊙
and 2 M⊙ i.e. comparable with those of the Galactic field.
The Pleiades MF was derived in this mass range using
the same technique described in Sect. 3.1 assuming a single age (log t/yr = 8.1) and metallicity ([Fe/H=0]) derived
from the comparison with MESA isochrones, in agreement

with previous literature determinations (Soderblom et al.
2009; Gossage et al. 2018). Absolute magnitudes were computed from eq. 1 and assuming a reddening of E(B-V)=0.03
(Breger 1986). Different values of the binary fraction were
tested by randomly pairing a fraction of stars extracted from
the MF. The best fit MF was chosen as the one providing the lowest value of the penalty function ξ (eq. 3) and
it is shown in Fig. 11. It was obtained assuming a binary
fraction of fb = 37%, smaller than the 76% estimated by
Converse & Stahler (2008). The MF derived here is compatible with that estimated by the most comprehensive studies conducted on this stellar system to date (Moraux et al.
2003; Olivares et al. 2018) in the high mass range, although

Olivares et al. (2018) derive a significantly flatter MF with
α = −1.12 in the mass range 0.2 < M/M⊙ < 0.56.

Qualitatively, the Pleiades MF is remarkably similar
to that estimated in the solar neighbourhood over its entire mass extent. In particular, the MF steepens toward
high masses with a possible break mass at M ∼ 1 M⊙ .
A fit with a broken power law gives α = −1.6 ± 0.2 and
α = −3.4 ± 0.3 at masses below/above 1 M⊙ . These slopes
are slightly steeper but still compatible with those estimated
in the Galactic field. In particular, the Pleiades MF slope at
masses M > 1 M⊙ is much more similar to that estimated
in the solar neighbourhood when a low-resolution SFH is
assumed. Part of the difference could be due to the larger
binary fraction estimated in this cluster since, as shown in

uncertainty are represented by the solid line and the grey shaded area, respectively.

Fig. 4, the binary fraction and the MF slope in the low-mass
range are correlated with large binary fractions corresponding to steeper MF slopes. Given the large uncertainty associated to the binary fraction estimate (ǫfb ∼ 10%), it is
possible to obtain a good fit to both the Pleiades and the
solar neighbourhood assuming the same binary fraction and
MF slope.
The MF of single and binary stars was integrated
over the mass range between the hydrogen-burning limit
(0.09 M⊙ ) and the mass at the tip of the Red Giant Branch
(4.61 M⊙ ) predicted by the best fit MESA isochrone to estimate the total cluster mass. The contribution to the total mass of white dwarfs was estimated by integrating from
the tip of the Red Giant Branch to 8 M⊙ and adopting
the initial-final mass relation of Kalirai et al. (2008), and is
found to be ∼1.2%. The estimated total mass of the Pleiades
is 365 ± 15 M⊙ . The radial cumulative mass distribution of
member stars was also calculated and fitted with a King
MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2019)

(1966) model with central adimensional parameter W0 = 3
and a half-mass radius of rh = 1.59◦ corresponding to 3.8
pc at the distance of the Pleiades. The mass, half-mass radius and number of objects estimated above were used to
compute the half-mass relaxation time (Spitzer 1987) of the
Pleiades trh = 127 M yr. This timescale is comparable to
the age of this stellar system so that, while the effect of
two-body relaxation could be measurable in massive stars,
it could not have significantly altered the global shape of the
IMF (Baumgardt & Makino 2003).

By converting the mean proper motions to projected velocities and adopting a radial velocity of
3.503 km/s (Conrad et al. 2014), I reconstructed the
orbit of the Pleiades in the last 130 Myr in a
Johnston, Spergel, & Hernquist (1995) potential using a
fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator. The orbit of the
Pleiades is confined to a small region of the R-Z plane oscil-

Summarizing, being dynamically young and having
been likely formed in the solar neighbourhood, the Pleiades
are a representative episode of recent star formation in the
solar vicinity whose IMF has still not been affected by dynamical evolution. The similarity between their MF and that
estimated in the field supports the robustness of the IMF derived in Sect. 4.2.

5.3

Comparison with IMF of dynamically
unrelaxed stellar systems

In the left panels of Fig.s 8 and 9, the IMF is compared
with those available for a sample of dynamically unrelaxed stellar systems i.e. associations and galaxies. Among
nearby associations I considered the deep MF estimates for

the Orion Nebula Cluster (with [Fe/H] ∼0 and an average age of 2.3 Myr; Da Rio et al. 2012) and the LH95
in the Large Magellanic Cloud ([Fe/H] ∼ -0.3, t∼ 4 Myr;
Da Rio, Gouliermis, & Henning 2009). In the sub-solar mass
regime the IMF estimated in this work lies between those estimated for these two objects, while at large masses a good
agreement is found with the LH95 MF. Note that, according to the quoted errors, at M < 0.4 M⊙ the MFs of these
two associations differ significantly. To quantify this difference, a χ2 test was performed selecting the portion of the
MFs of these two associations (log Na and log Nb , respectively) in the n bins in the common mass range. A normalization factor c, needed to account for the different mass of
the two associations, was calculated as that providing the
best match between the two MFs (i.e. the inverse-variance
weighted mean of the MF differences in the mass range con-

lower boundary of the distribution of the considered MFs,
being significantly flatter than the steepest ones such as e.g.
that of the Small Magellanic Cloud. At masses above the
solar mass, for both of the two assumptions on the SFH,
the IMF estimated here is comprised between those of the
Ultra faint dwarfs and that of the Small Magellanic Clouds.
Again, in spite of the large uncertainties involved, there is
a wide spread among the various galaxies.
To test the hypothesis that the differences between the
MF of these stellar systems and that estimated for the solar neighbourhood are due to random uncertainties, a χ2
test was performed (see above). Significant (Pχ2 < 0.3%)
differences were found with respect to the Orion Nebula
Cluster, the Small Magellanic Clouds and ω Cen, while for
the other systems the differences are significant at values
0.3% < Pχ2 < 5%. The same result is obtained when adopting the solar neighbourhood MF estimated in the low-mass
range using the PARSEC isochrones and the MF derived
adopting either the low- or the high-resolution SFH in the
super-solar regime.

was then calculated. If the two estimated MFs are extracted
from the same parent distribution, the function above should
be distributed as a χ2 with n-1 degrees of freedom. The associated probability (Pχ2 ) is therefore an indicator of the
similarity of the two MFs. The above test gives a probability < 10−3 that the MFs of the two associations are extracted from the same parent distribution. These systems
were analysed by the same group with the same technique,
so it is unlikely that the difference above can be attributed
to systematic errors. Moreover, given their young ages, this
difference cannot be interpreted as a result of any dynamical process occurring on such a short timescale and could
therefore be primordial.
I also considered the MF measured in a sample of
nearby galaxies: the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds
(Gouliermis, Brandner, & Henning 2006;
Kalirai et al.
2013), the sample of Ultra faint dwarfs by Gennaro et al.
(2018a,b) and ω Centauri (Sollima, Ferraro, & Bellazzini
2007), the massive globular cluster with a half-mass
relaxation time longer than its age and supposed to be
the remnant of an accreted galaxy because of its large
metallicity spread (Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn 2002). The
galaxies considered span a wide range in metallicity: from
[F e/H] ∼ −2.7 for the Ultra-faint dwarfs (Simon et al.
2015) to [Fe/H]=-0.3 for the Large Magellanic Clouds
(Luck et al. 1998). Also in this case, at low-masses there
is a large spread in the MF measured in these objects.

SUMMARY

I used the most complete and accurate data set available to
date provided by the 2nd data release of the Gaia mission
to derive the IMF of the solar neighbourhood. The resulting
IMF is well represented by a segmented power-law with two
breaks at characteristic masses.
The first break occurs in the very low-mass regime
where the IMF clearly flattens (and possibly decreases)
at M < 0.15 M⊙ . This feature does not depend on the
adopted stellar models, fraction of binaries or sample completeness. Unfortunately, because of the uncertainties on the
mass-luminosity relation at very-low masses, it is not clear
whether the deficiency of stars observed at masses below
such a break is significant. A similar claim was made by
De Marchi & Paresce (1997) on the basis of the analysis of
the MF of a sample of Galactic globular clusters. That evidence was however questioned because of the uncertain completeness of their data at faint magnitudes and the possible
occurrence of dynamical effects in these old stellar systems
(Piotto & Zoccali 1999).
The existence of a peak in the IMF is predicted by star
formation theories although it is not clear if its position
should lie in the stellar or sub-stellar regime. It is interesting to analyse the observational evidence presented here in
the light of the two main star formation theories. Theories
based on the fragmentation on Jeans mass scale + accretion
(Larson 1992; Hennebelle & Chabrier 2008) predict a peak
mass corresponding to the smallest self-gravitating mass in
a cloud able to collapse. This characteristic mass depends on
the ratio between the thermal Jeans mass and the square of
the cloud Mach number (Chabrier, Hennebelle, & Charlot
2014). These quantities are functions of the thermodynamical properties of the original cloud (temperature, mean
molecular weight, density) and on the relative efficiency of
those processes affecting turbulent and magnetic pressure.
Clouds below this critical mass should not begin star formation unless a local temperature/density/pressure fluctuation causes a decrease of the ratio mentioned above. In
this picture, the evidence shown here suggests that in the

solar neighbourhood star formation occurred in conditions
(low Mach number, low molecular weight, high temperature,
small cloud size) favouring the emergence of a peak mass at
a relatively high mass. On the other hand, in theories based
on the accretion/feedback balance (Adams & Fatuzzo 1996)
the peak in the MF is given by the minimum sound speed
(i.e. its thermal value at the cloud temperature) while stars
below this mass can still form as a result of fluctuations in
the other involved parameters. From their calculation, the
IMF peak should lie at M ∼ 0.07M⊙ slightly lower than the
value determined here. Also in this scenario, the existence
of a peak in the IMF at M ∼ 0.15M⊙ suggests conditions
leading to a larger minimum sound speed (i.e. larger temperature, lower molecular weight).
In the mass range 0.15 < M/M⊙ < 1 the MF is
well represented by a single power-law with mean slope
α = −1.34±0.07. This mean value is in agreement within the
uncertainties with the average slopes in the same mass range
found in all previous works (Miller & Scalo 1979; Kroupa
2001; Chabrier 2003a; Just & Jahreiß 2010; Rybizki & Just
2015) although some of these last works adopted different
functional forms for the MF. Unfortunately, it is not an easy
task to distinguish among the various analytical representations (broken power-law, log-normal, tampered log-normal,
etc.) because they almost overlap in this mass range. Moreover, systematic uncertainties in the mass-luminosity relation can create artifacts altering the shape of the MF at
small scales (see Sect.3.2). I do not notice any change of slope
at 0.5 M⊙ as reported by Kroupa (2001), in agreement with
the works by Miller & Scalo (1979), Chabrier (2003a) and
Rybizki & Just (2015). While the uncertainties in the massluminosity relation described above can hide the evidence of
such a break, a significant slope change in this intermediate
mass range 0.15 < M/M⊙ < 1 is not supported by the data
analysed here.

At masses larger than 1 M⊙ , if a smoothly varying
SFH is assumed, the average IMF slope is found to be
α = −2.68 ± 0.09, significantly steeper than those found
in works (Salpeter 1955; Miller & Scalo 1979; Kroupa 2001)
dated before the most extensive astrometric missions (Hipparcos and Gaia; although a similar value was reported
by Kroupa, Tout, & Gilmore 1993) and compatible with
those found in subsequent analyses (Dawson & Schröder
2010; Just & Jahreiß 2010; Rybizki & Just 2015; Mor et al.
2019). Given the improvement in sample size and accuracy of these surveys, these last results seem to be more
robust. Unfortunately, this portion of the MF is subject
to many systematic uncertainties linked to the modelling
of the age/metallicity/distance/reddening variations and on
the uncertainties in the SFH (see Sect. 4.2). Indeed, a flatter IMF slope would be compatible with the data if a bursty
SFH characterized by rapid variations of the star formation
rate were adopted.
A steep IMF is also suggested by the IMF measured
in the Pleiades which formed in a single burst of star
formation and where no significant spread in metallicity/reddening/distance is expected. The analysis performed
in Sect. 5.2 shows that this cluster formed in the solar vicinity and should not have experienced significant dynamical
evolution. In the commonly accepted scenario, where the
Galactic field population originates in clusters and associations which dissolve in a quick timescale (Kroupa & Weidner
2003; Kruijssen 2012; Jeřábková et al. 2018), the IMF measured in the solar neighbourhood is therefore not representative of a single star formation event but is the superposition of contributions of many small episodes. The Pleiades
are thus an example in which such building blocks retain
the information on the IMF in their PDMF. However, it
must be considered that low-mass stars move away from
their original site of birth more efficiently than massive ones
MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2019)

The IMF of the solar neighbourhood
because of the velocity drift induced by primordial mass
segregation and competitive accretion (Bonnell et al. 1997;
McMillan, Vesperini, & Portegies Zwart 2007) and because
of their long lifetime, have more time to distribute over
the Galactic plane. Therefore, samples of stars covering a
wide portion of the field contain preferentially low-mass stars
while high-mass ones are confined in more compact portions
of the phase-space close to the position of their original birth
sites. This effect is responsible for a large cosmic variance in
the Galactic disk IMF, with a bias toward measuring steeper
IMF slope in the field (Parravano, Hollenbach, & McKee
2018).
The slopes of the IMF at intermediate and high-masses
have been interpreted in different ways by different star
formation theories. According to theories of accretion onto
Jeans mass scale fragments, accretion occurs in a competitive way at different characteristic stellar radii in different
cluster regions according to the relative contribution to the
overall cluster potential of gas and stars. In this model, highmass stars preferentially form in a clustered environment in
the central region of the proto-clusters and accrete the majority of their mass at the Bondi-Hoyle radius. The strong
mass dependence of the accretion rate results in a steeper
IMF with respect to that predicted by simple tidal accretion onto individual fragments typical of low-mass stars.
The transition between the accretion- and fragmentationdominated regimes depends on the prescriptions adopted for
primordial mass segregation and on the relative distribution
of gas and stars at early stages. In the two regimes considered above the IMF should be characterized by an asymptotic slope α ∼ −1.5 at low-masses and α ∼ −2.5 at highmasses (Bonnell et al. 2001). These values are in agreement
with those found in the present analysis. In this picture, the
results presented here support a transition mass close to 1
M⊙ dividing the mass spectrum in two ranges characterized
by different slopes. Alternatively, in the Adams & Fatuzzo
(1996) theory, the change of IMF slope is due to the different mass-luminosity relation of young stellar objects as
a function of their mass (Adams & Fatuzzo 1996). Indeed,
while the luminosity of low mass objects is determined by
the infall rate, massive ones generate a significant fraction
of luminosity through gravitational contraction, deuteriumand eventually hydrogen-burning. In this case, the transition is extremely smooth and should occur at ∼ 3.1M⊙ .
Note that in this simplified model, even assuming a dependence of the IMF slope on the sound speed distribution alone
(i.e. the parameter with the largest contribution to the final
stellar mass), the IMF slope should have a small variation
−2.1 < α < −1.7 across the entire mass range, much smaller
than that observed in this analysis. The stochastic variation
of the other parameters involved smoothes the overall IMF
further, reducing the slope variation and enhancing the tension with observations. However, the models above contain
many simplified recipes to model the complex set of physical processes at work in star forming regions so that it is
hard to rule out this scenario on the basis of relatively small
differences in the shape of the IMF.
The comparison of the IMF measured in the solar neighbourhood with those estimated in other non-collisional environments (galaxies and associations) reveals a significant
degree of variability incompatible with the quoted uncertainties. This would imply that the IMF is not Universal.
MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2019)

However, there is no clear trend of the IMF slope with either metallicity or environment. Consider that, as shown in
Sect. 4.2, systematic effects can alter the MF slope by a large
amount. Since the MFs considered have been estimated by
different groups adopting different prescriptions, it is possible that any existing trend could have been erased by such
systematic errors.
The analysis presented here will further benefit from
the next Gaia data releases. Indeed, besides the incremental improvement of the photometric and astrometric performances, the completeness at bright magnitudes should be
established allowing the use of the brightest portion of the
luminosity function to constrain the IMF at its high-mass
end (M > 2.5 M⊙ ) and to constrain the SFH at recent
epochs with better resolution. Moreover, starting from DR3
metallicities, reddening and a classification of binaries will
be provided, thus allowing to calibrate the model parameters better, accounting for their variation across the disc and
to replace the statistical population synthesis approach with
a star-by-star modelling.
