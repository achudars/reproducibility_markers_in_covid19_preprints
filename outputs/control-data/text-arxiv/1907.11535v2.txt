CONVERGENCE TO THE GRIM REAPER FOR A CURVATURE FLOW
WITH UNBOUNDED BOUNDARY SLOPES∗
BENDONG LOU† , XIAOLIU WANG‡ AND LIXIA YUAN†,§

Abstract. We consider a curvature flow V = H in the band domain Ω := [−1, 1] × R, where,
for a graphic curve Γt , V denotes its normal velocity and H denotes its curvature. If Γt
contacts the two boundaries ∂± Ω of Ω with constant slopes, in 1993, Altschular and Wu [2]
proved that Γt converges to a grim reaper contacting ∂± Ω with the same prescribed slopes. In
this paper we consider the case where Γt contacts ∂± Ω with slopes equaling to ±1 times of its
height. When the curve moves to infinity, the global gradient estimate is impossible due to the
unbounded boundary slopes. We first consider a special symmetric curve and derive its uniform
interior gradient estimates by using the zero number argument, and then use these estimates to
present uniform interior gradient estimates for general non-symmetric curves, which lead to the
2,1
convergence of the curve in Cloc
((−1, 1) × R) topology to the grim reaper with span (−1, 1).

1. Introduction
Since the pioneering work of Gage and Hamilton [9] in 1986, the curve shortening problem
has been studied widely in different settings. An important case is to investigate the problem
with some boundary conditions. Those kind of boundary problems are not only interesting from
geometric viewpoint, but also important in the study of phase transition models. Also, they can
be used to describe the interface propagation arising in some reaction-diffusion equations, such
as the Allen-Cahn equation. Usually, there will be a contact angle condition at the intersection
points between the evolving curves (interfaces) and the domain boundaries (see, for example,
[19, 20]). In particular, we focus on the following curvature flow
(1.1)

V =H

on

Γt ⊂ Ω,

in the band domain Ω := {(x, y)| − 1 ≤ x ≤ 1, y ∈ R} in R2 , where, Γt is a family of embedded
curves in Ω which contact the boundaries ∂± Ω := {±1} × R of Ω with prescribed angles, V
and H denote the normal velocity and the curvature of Γt , respectively. Indeed, Huisken [14]
considered this curvature flow in 1998. He discovered a distance comparison principle to show
that the flow with fixed endpoints (Dirichlet boundary condition) exists globally and converges
to a straight line linking two endpoints, and the flow having orthonormal boundary contact
(homogeneous Neumann boundary condition) also exists globally but converges to a constant
eventually.
In case, for each t ≥ 0, Γt is the graph of a function y = u(x, t), we have

and the problem can be expressed as
(
uxx
,
−1 < x < 1, t > 0,
ut =
1 + u2x
(1.2)
ux (±1, t) = g± , t > 0,

where g− , g+ denote the boundary contact conditions and will be made clear later. In 1993,
Altschuler and Wu [2] studied the inhomogeneous Neumann problem, that is, the case where
g+ , −g− are positive constants. They proved that any global solution converges to a grim
reaper (which is also called a traveling wave by some authors). In 1994, Altschular and Wu [3]
extended their result in [2] to two dimension. In 2012, Cai and Lou [4] considered (1.2) with
g± being (almost) periodic functions of u, and proved that any solution converges to a (almost)
periodic traveling wave. Recently, Yuan and Lou [21] considered the case where g± = g± (u) are
asymptotic periodic functions as u → ±∞. They constructed some entire solutions connecting
two periodic traveling waves.
Other works related to the mean curvature flow (1.1), as well as its anisotropic analogues, in
domains in R2 with boundaries include [17, 18] for problems in band domain with undulating
boundaries; [5, 11, 12, 15] for self-similar solutions in sectors; [6, 13] for problems on the half
plane, etc.
In all of the above mentioned works, the boundary slopes are bounded, no matter they are
linear or nonlinear. In this paper, we consider a different case:

uxx

−1 < x < 1, t > 0,
 ut = 1 + u2 ,
x
(1.3)
u (±1, t) = ±u(±1, t), t > 0,

 x
u(x, 0) = u0 (x),
− ≤ x ≤ 1,

which has unbounded boundary slopes when u goes to infinity. This kind of boundary conditions
are of interest not only in geometry and partial differential equations but also in some applied
fields. In 2012, Chou and Wang [7] considered the equation in (1.3) with Robin boundary
conditions:
ux (±1, t) = α± u(±1, t) + β± , t > 0.
They divided the parameters α± and β± into several cases, and studied the asymptotic behavior
in each cases. For the cases min u → ∞ or max u → −∞ (this happens, for example, when
α− < 0 < α+ ), however, the authors did not obtain the convergence of the solution and left it as
an open problem. In this paper, we will show the convergence to a grim reaper for unbounded
solutions to (1.3). Our approach (with slight modification) and our results remain valid for the
problems with other unbounded boundary slopes such as the Robin ones, ux (±1, t) = ±u2 (±1, t),
ux (±1, t) = ±eu(±1,t) , etc.
The global well-posedness of the problem (1.3) is studied in a standard way. For any timeglobal solution moving upward to infinity, ux is unbounded due to the boundary conditions.
This will be the main difficulty in studying the asymptotic behavior for such solutions. It is
natural to consider the convergence in L∞
loc ((−1, 1)) topology in such cases. This, however, also
needs some uniform (in t) interior gradient estimates. The well known results in this field as in
[10] are not applied here since they depend on the boundedness of u. Instead, we will use the
so-called zero number argument (i.e., zero number diminishing properties, cf. [1, 16]) for one
dimensional parabolic equations to derive the uniform bounds for the gradient of the solution
in any interior domain (see details in sections 4 and 5). Furthermore, as can be expected, the
profile of the solution might converge to a traveling wave with infinite slopes near the boundaries,
which should be the grim reaper with span in (−1, 1), that is,

Actually we will show the following result.
Theorem 1.1. Assume u0 (x) ∈ C 1 ([−1, 1]) with
(1.5)

u0 (x) ≥ 1 (x ∈ [−1, 1]),

u′0 (±1) = ±u0 (±1).

Then the problem (1.3) has a time-global solution u(x, t). It moves upward to infinity and

(1.6)
u(x, t + s) − u(0, s) → ϕ0 (x) + t,
2
2,1
in the topology of Cloc
((−1, 1) × R) .
This paper is arranged as follows. In section 2, as preliminaries, we present traveling waves
(grim reapers) contacting the boundaries of Ω with various different constant slopes. In section 3,
we give some rough a priori estimates and then show the time-global existence for the solution of
(1.3). In section 4, we consider symmetric solutions of (1.3). First we present precise estimates
for ux by using the zero-number argument, and then show its convergence to the grim reaper.
Finally, in section 5 we consider general solutions of (1.3) which are not necessary symmetric.
By some further uniform interior estimates we show its convergence to the grim reaper.
2. Traveling Waves
First we give a definition.
Definition 2.1. A function u(x, t) satisfying
(
uxx
,
−1 < x < 1, t > 0,
ut ≤
1 + u2x
ux (1, t) ≤ u(1, t), ux (−1, t) ≥ −u(−1, t),

t > 0,

is called a lower solution of (1.3). A function u(x, t) satisfying the reversed inequalities is called
an upper solution of (1.3).
As preliminaries, we study the following problem
(
uxx
,
−1 < x < 1,
ut =
1 + u2x
(2.1)
ux (±1, t) = ±h, t ∈ R.

t ∈ R,

For each h > 0, a traveling wave of (2.1) (also called a translating solution in [2]) is a special
solution of the form
u(x, t) = ϕ(x; h) + c(h)t.
Substituting this formula into (2.1) we easily obtain
1
(2.2)
ϕ(x; h) := −
ln [cos (c(h)x)] .
c(h) := arctan h,
c(h)
ϕ is called a grim reaper in [2]. Note that
ln(1 + h2 )
,
ϕx (±1; h) = ±h.
2 arctan h
Hence, for any M ∈ R, ϕ(x; h) + c(h)t + M is a lower solution of (1.3) when
(2.3)

ϕ(±1; h) =

h ≤ ϕ(1; h) + c(h)t + M.
It is an upper solution if the reversed inequality holds.
Besides the traveling waves of (2.1), we have another grim reaper ϕ0 (x) + π2 t with ϕ0 defined
by (1.4). Note that the definition domain of ϕ0 (x) is (−1, 1), that is, this grim reaper lies
completely in Ω. In what follows we will use the above grim reapers to give a priori estimates
for the solution of (1.3).

3. Global Well-posedness of (1.3)
Assume u(x, t) is a classical solution of (1.3) in the time-interval [0, T ] for some T > 0. We
first give its L∞ estimate.
Lemma 3.1. There exist C1 , C2 > 0 with C2 depending on T such that
(3.1)

c(1)t − C1 ≤ u(x, t) ≤ C2 (T ),

x ∈ [−1, 1], t ∈ [0, T ].

Proof. Assume, for some M0 > 0,
(3.2)

1 ≤ u0 (x) ≤ M0 ,

x ∈ [−1, 1].

Then
u(x, t) := ϕ(x; 1) + c(1)t + 1 − ϕ(1; 1)
is a lower solution of (1.3) and so, by the comparison principle we have
(3.3)

u(x, t) = ϕ(x; 1) + c(1)t + 1 − ϕ(1; 1) ≤ u(x, t),

x ∈ [−1, 1], t > 0,

which leads to the first inequality in (3.1).
Next we consider the upper bound. Since
h − ϕ(±1; h) = h −

ln(1 + h2 )
→∞
2 arctan h

as

h → ∞,

there exists h = hT large such that
(3.4)

hT > ϕ(±1; hT ) +

π
T + M0 .
2

Set
u(x, t) := ϕ(x; hT ) + c(hT )t + M0 ,
x ∈ [−1, 1], t > 0.
We verify that u is an upper solution of (1.3) in the time interval [0, T ]. In fact, u satisfies the
equation in (1.3). Moreover, for t ∈ [0, T ],
π
u(1, t) < ϕ(1; hT ) + t + M0 < hT = ux (1, t),
2
by (3.4), and
u(x, 0) = ϕ(x; hT ) + M0 ≥ M0 ≥ u0 (x),
x ∈ [−1, 1].
Hence, u is an upper solution of (1.3). By comparison principle we have
π
x ∈ [−1, 1], t ∈ [0, T ].
u(x, t) ≤ u(x, t) ≤ ϕ(1; hT ) + M0 + T,
2
This proves the second inequality of (3.1).

Next, we give the gradient estimate.
Lemma 3.2. Let u(x, t) be a solution of (1.3) in the time interval [0, T ]. Then there exist C3 (T )
such that
|ux (x, t)| ≤ C3 (T ),
x ∈ [−1, 1], t ∈ [0, T ].
Proof. From the above lemma, we see that
|ux (±1, t)| = |u(±1, t)| ≤ C1 + C2 (T ),

t ∈ [0, T ].

Using the maximum principle for ux we see that
|ux (x, t)| ≤ C3 (T ) := max{ku′0 kC , C1 + C2 (T )},
This proves the lemma.

x ∈ [−1, 1], t ∈ [0, T ].

With the above a priori estimates in hand, by using the standard parabolic theory we obtain
the time-global existence of the classical solution u(x, t). Its uniqueness is proved in the standard
way by using the maximum principle.
4. Symmetric Solutions
In this section we consider symmetric solutions. More precisely, we consider the case where
u0 (x) ∈ C 1 ([−1, 1]) satisfies the following conditions:
(4.1) u0 (x) = u0 (−x),

1 ≤ u0 (x) ≤ M0 ,

0 < u′0 (x) < ϕ′0 (x) for x ∈ (0, 1),

u′0 (1) = u0 (1),

for some M0 > 0. In this case we easily have
u(x, t) = u(−x, t),

ux (x, t) > 0

for x ∈ (0, 1], t > 0.

To study the convergence of u (actually, the convergence of u(x, t + s) − u(0, s) as s → ∞), we
need further estimate for ux . We will do this by the so-called zero number argument.
4.1. Finer lower gradient estimate. In this part, we show that “the gradient of u is not too
small” for x ∈ (0, 1).
Fix an h0 > 0. For any h ≥ M0 + h0 we see that
u(x, t; h) := ϕ(x; h0 ) + c(h0 )t + h
is a lower solution of (1.3). Denote the union of the graphes of u(x, t; h) as
D(t) := {(x, y) | y ≥ u(x, t; M0 + h0 ), x ∈ [−1, 1]} .
Then D(t) is the upper half of Ω with bottom {(x, u(x, t; M0 + h0 )) | x ∈ [−1, 1]}, which moves
upward with speed c(h0 ).
We now construct another lower solution below the real solution u such that it moves faster
than D(t), and so pushes u entering the domain D(t) for large t. Then, by considering the
derivatives of u(x, t) and u(x, t; h) at their contact points, we can obtain the desired gradient
estimate. To construct another lower solution below u, we notice by (3.1) that u(x, t) moves up
to infinity. Hence for any given h0 > h0 , there exists t0 large such that
u(x, t0 ) > ϕ(x; h0 ) + h0 ≥ h0 ,

x ∈ [−1, 1].

Thus,
u∗ (x, t) := ϕ(x; h0 ) + h0 + c(h0 )t
is also a lower solution to (1.3). By the comparison principle we have
u∗ (x, t) ≤ u(x, t + t0 ),

(4.2)

x ∈ [−1, 1], t ≥ 0.

c(h0 )

Since
> c(h0 ) we see that for all large t (to say, t ≥ T 0 ), u∗ (x, t) rushes into the domain
D(t), so dose u(x, t + t0 ) due to (4.2). In other words, when t ≥ t0 + T 0 , the graph of u(x, t) is
immersed in the solid D(t). Therefore, for any t1 ≥ t0 + T 0 and any x1 ∈ (0, 1), there exists a
unique h ≥ M0 + h0 such that u(x1 , t1 ) = u(x1 , t1 ; h). We now show that
0 < ux (x1 , t1 ; h) ≤ ux (x1 , t1 ).

(4.3)

In this sense, we say that “the gradient of u is not too small” for x ∈ (0, 1).
We first consider the case where u(x, t1 ) ≤ u(x, t1 ; h) or u(x, t1 ) ≥ u(x, t1 ; h) for x ∈ (0, 1). In
such cases, it is clear that ux (x1 , t1 ; h) = ux (x1 , t1 ). Next, we consider the case
(4.4)

max [u(x, t1 ) − u(x, t1 ; h)] > 0 > min [u(x, t1 ) − u(x, t1 ; h)].

x∈[0,1]

x∈[0,1]

By continuity, these inequalities remain valid for any t near t1 . Hence such t form an interval.
Denote the largest interval containing t1 by (s1 , s2 ), then (4.4) holds for any t ∈ (s1 , s2 ) and
s1 > 0 since u(x, 0; h) ≥ h > M0 ≥ u(x, 0). At s1 we have the following claim:

6

B. LOU, X. WANG, L. YUAN

Claim 1. u(x, s1 ; h) ≥ u(x, s1 ) in [0, 1], and u(1, s1 ; h) = u(1, s1 ).
Totally, there are four cases between u(x, s1 ; h) and u(x, s1 ):
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

u(x, s1 ; h) > u(x, s1 ) in [0, 1];
u(x, s1 ; h) ≤ u(x, s1 ) in [0, 1];
(4.4) holds at s1 ;
u(x, s1 ; h) ≥ u(x, s1 ) in [0, 1], equality holds at some points and strict inequality holds at
other points.

We now show that the cases (a), (b) and (c) are impossible, and Claim 1 holds in case (d). In
fact, in case (a), by continuity we have u(x, t; h) > u(x, t) for t satisfying s1 < t ≪ s1 + 1. In
case (b), by comparison we have u(x, t; h) < u(x, t) for x ∈ [0, 1] and t > s1 . In case (c), there
is a small time interval containing s1 as its interior point such that (4.4) holds in this interval.
Thus, all of these three cases contradict the definition of (s1 , s2 ). The only left possible case
is (d). If u(1, s1 ; h) > u(1, s1 ), then using the strong comparison principle in [0, 1] × [s1 , t) for
s1 < t ≪ s1 + 1 we conclude that u(x, t; h) > u(x, t) in this domain. This again contradicts the
definition of (s1 , s2 ). Therefore, u(1, s1 ; h) = u(1, s1 ), and Claim 1 is proved.
Claim 2. For any t ∈ (s1 , s2 ), u(·, t; h) contacts u(·, t) at exactly one point x = X(t, h) in (0, 1)
with ux (X, t; h) < ux (X, t).
Since, by Claim 1,
(4.5)

ux (1, s1 ; h) = h0 < u(1, s1 ; h) = u(1, s1 ) = ux (1, s1 ),

we have u(x, s1 ; h) > u(x, s1 ) in (x∗ , 1) for some x∗ near 1. Using Claim 1 and the comparison
principle in the domain {(x, t) | 0 < x < x∗ , t > s1 with t − s1 ≪ 1} we conclude that
u(x, t; h) > u(x, t) in this domain. Therefore, Claim 2 holds for s1 < t ≪ s1 + 1, and the unique
contact point between u(·, t; h) and u(·, t) is near 1. If we can show that u(1, t; h) < u(1, t) for
all t ∈ (s1 , s2 ), then combining with the Neumann condition at x = 0:
ux (0, t; h) = ux (0, t) = 0,
we can derive Claim 2 by the zero number argument ([1]). Assume by contradiction that
for some s3 ∈ (s1 , s2 ), u(1, t; h) < u(1, t) for t ∈ (s1 , s3 ), but u(1, s3 ; h) = u(1, s3 ). Then
Claim 2 holds in (s1 , s3 ). Due to u(1, s3 ; h) = u(1, s3 ) and the analogue of (4.5) at s3 , there
exists x∗ ∈ (0, 1) such that u(x, s3 ; h) > u(x, s3 ) for x ∈ [x∗ , 1). By continuity, there exists a
small ǫ > 0 such that u(x∗ , t; h) > u(x∗ , t) for t ∈ (s3 − ǫ, s3 + ǫ). Then, in the time period
(s3 − ǫ, s3 ), the unique contact point X(t, h) between u(·, t; h) and u(·, t) lies in (x∗ , 1) since
u(x∗ , t; h) > u(x∗ , t) and u(1, t; h) < u(1, t) for t ∈ (s3 − ǫ, s3 ). Therefore, u(x, t; h) > u(x, t) for
(x, t) ∈ [0, x∗ ]×(s3 −ǫ, s3 ). Using the strong maximum principle we see that u(x, s3 ; h) > u(x, s3 )
for x ∈ [0, x∗ ]. Consequently, u(x, s3 ; h) > u(x, s3 ) in [0, 1). This, however, contradicts the
definition of (s1 , s2 ) and our assumption s3 ∈ (s1 , s2 ). Therefore, Claim 2 holds for all t ∈ (s1 , s2 ).
Using Claim 2 in particular at t1 ∈ (s1 , s2 ), we have ux (X(t1 , h), t1 ; h) < ux (X(t1 , h), t1 ),
where X(t1 , h) is the unique contact point between u(·, t1 ; h) and u(·, t1 ), which is nothing but
x1 . This proves (4.3). Since t1 ≥ t0 + T 0 and x1 ∈ (0, 1) are arbitrarily given, we actually obtain
the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1. For any t ≥ t0 + T 0 and any x ∈ (0, 1), there holds
ux (−x, t) ≤ ϕ′ (−x; h0 ) < 0,

0 < ϕ′ (x; h0 ) ≤ ux (x, t).

The inequalities in this lemma in fact can be improved to strict ones by using the strong
maximum principle and the zero number argument, which is omitted here, since the present
version is enough for our approach below.

4.2. Finer upper gradient estimate. We now show that “the gradient of u is not too large”
for x ∈ (0, 1).
By our assumption u′0 (x) < ϕ′0 (x) for x ∈ (0, 1), we see that u0 (x) ≤ ϕ0 (x) + u0 (0) in (−1, 1),
and so
π
x ∈ (−1, 1), t > 0
(4.6)
u(x, t) < ϕ0 (x) + u0 (0) + t,
2
by the comparison principle. On the other hand, for any r < u0 (0), ϕ0 (x)+ r − u0 (x) has exactly
two non-degenerate zeros. Since ζ(x, t) := ϕ0 (x) + π2 t + r − u(x, t) satisfies a linear parabolic
equation whose coefficients are bounded in any compact interval of (−1, 1) × (0, ∞), and since
ζ(−1 + 0, t) = ζ(1 − 0, t) = +∞,

t > 0,

we can use the zero number argument to conclude that, for any t > 0, either
(1) ζ(·, t) has two non-degenerate zeros ±ρ(t) with ρ(t) ∈ (0, 1); or
(2) ζ(·, t) has a unique degenerate zero 0; or
(3) ζ(·, t) is positive, and has no zeros in (−1, 1).
Note that, for any t > 0, the graph of u(·, t) is immersed in
o
n
π 
E(t) :=
x, ϕ0 (x) + r + t x ∈ (−1, 1), r ≤ u0 (0) .
2
Hence, for any t2 > 0 and any x2 ∈ (0, 1), there exists a unique r = R(t2 , x2 ) < u0 (0) such that
ζ(·, t2 ) with r = R(t2 , x2 ) has exactly two zeros x = ±x2 . Consequently,
(4.7)

ϕ′0 (−x2 ) < ux (−x2 , t2 ) < 0,

0 < ux (x2 , t2 ) < ϕ′0 (x2 ).

In this sense, we say that “the gradient of u is not too large” for x ∈ (0, 1).
4.3. Convergence of the solution. Assume u(x, t) is a symmetric solution starting from an
initial data satisfying (4.1). Let {tn } be a time sequence with tn → ∞ (n → ∞). Set
un (x, t) := u(x, t + tn ) − u(0, tn ),

x ∈ [−1, 1], −tn < t < ∞.

For any given small ε > 0, by the results in the previous two subsections we have
(4.8)

ϕ′ (x; h0 ) < unx (x, t) < ϕ′0 (x),

x ∈ (0, 1 − ε], n ≫ 1.

h0 > 0 can be as large as possible, provided n is sufficiently large and t is bounded. Combining
with Lemma 3.1 we have
kun (x, t)kC 1,0 ([ε−1,1−ε]×[−T,T ]) ≤ C1 (ε, T ),
for any T > 0. By the Lp estimates, Sobolev embedding theorem and the Schauder estimate we
have, for any α ∈ (0, 1),
kun (x, t)kC 2+α,1+ α2 ([ε−1,1−ε]×[−T,T ]) ≤ C2 (ε, T ).
Therefore, for any β ∈ (0, α), there exist a subsequence {uni } of {un } and a function UT,ε ∈
α
C 2+α,1+ 2 ([ε − 1, 1 − ε] × [−T, T ]) such that
kuni − UT,ε k

β

C 2+β,1+ 2 ([ε−1,1−ε]×[−T,T ])

→ 0 (i → ∞).
2+α,1+ α
2

Using the Cantor’s diagonal argument, we see that there exist a function U ∈ Cloc
and a subsequence of {un } (denoted it again by {uni }) such that
uni → U (i → ∞),

in

topology.

Moreover, U (x, t) is an entire solution of the equation in (1.3) with U (0, 0) = 0 and, by (4.8),
ϕ′ (x; h0 ) ≤ Ux (x, t) ≤ ϕ′0 (x),

x ∈ [0, 1), t ∈ R.

8

B. LOU, X. WANG, L. YUAN

Since h0 > 0 can be as large as possible and since
ϕ′ (x; h0 ) → ϕ′0 (x) for x ∈ (−1, 1),

as

h0 → ∞,

we conclude that
Ux (x, t) = ϕ′0 (x),

x ∈ (−1, 1), t ∈ R,

and so
U (x, t) = ϕ0 (x) + C(t),

x ∈ (−1, 1), t ∈ R.

Finally, since U is an entire solution of the equation in (1.3), we see that C ′ (t) = π2 and thus
π
U (x, t) = ϕ0 (x) + t,
x ∈ (−1, 1), t ∈ R.
2
The above result implies that {uni } converges to the special grim reaper ϕ0 (x) + π2 t. Since
this grim reaper is unique and the time sequence {tn } is arbitrarily given, we actually obtain
the following result.
Theorem 4.2. Assume u(x, t) is the time-global solution of (1.3) with initial data u0 (x) satisfying (4.1). Then, for any α ∈ (0, 1),

5. General Solutions

The conclusion in the previous section holds only for symmetric solutions. We consider general
solutions in this section, that is, we assume u0 satisfies (1.5) in this section.
5.1. Interior estimates. We choose a smooth, even function ψ(x) with
0 < ψ ′ (x) < ϕ′0 (x),

ψ ′′ (x) > 0 for x ∈ (0, 1], ψ ′ (1) = ψ(1).

Then ψ satisfies (4.1) except for ψ(x) ≥ 1. One example is ψ(x) = δ 22 − π+4

δ > 0. Denote the solution of (1.3) with u(x, 0) = ψ(x) by u(x, t; ψ). Then it is symmetric,
uxx (x, t; ψ) > 0 due to ut (x, t; ψ) > 0, and it satisfies all the conclusions in the previous section.
Furthermore, it moves upward monotonically to infinity, so we have
0 < ψ(x) < u0 (x),

u0 (x) < u(x, T ; ψ),

x ∈ [−1, 1],

for some positive T . Thus, by the comparison principle we have
(5.1)

u(x, t; ψ) < u(x, t; u0 ) < u(x, t + T ; ψ),

x ∈ [−1, 1], t > 0.

This formula gives the L∞ estimate for u(x, t; u0 ).
In what follows, we want to present a uniform interior gradient estimate. First we prove a
lemma.
Lemma 5.1. For any small ε ∈ (0, 21 ) and any t > 0, there hold
(5.2)

min
|ux (x, t; u0 )| < M1 .
min
|ux (x, t; u0 )| < M1 := ε−1 ϕ0 (1 − ε) + T ,
ε−1≤x≤2ε−1
1−2ε≤x≤1−ε
2

Proof. We only prove the first inequality since the second one is proved similarly. Assume by
contradiction that, for some t = t0 > 0,
|ux (x, t0 ; u0 )| ≥ M1 ,

x ∈ [1 − 2ε, 1 − ε].

Integrating it over [1 − 2ε, 1 − ε] we obtain
(5.3)

u (1 − ε, t0 ; u0 ) − u (1 − 2ε, t0 ; u0 ) ≥ ϕ0 (1 − ε) +

π
T.
2

On the other hand, by (5.1) we have
(5.4)

u (1 − ε, t0 ; u0 ) − u (1 − 2ε, t0 ; u0 ) < u (1 − ε, t0 + T ; ψ) − u (1 − 2ε, t0 ; ψ)
≤ u (1 − ε, t0 + T ; ψ) − u (0, t0 ; ψ)

since u(·, t; ψ) is convex and symmetric. By (4.7), u(x, t0 ; ψ) < ϕ0 (x) + u(0, t0 ; ψ), and so by
comparison we have
π
u(x, t0 + T ; ψ) < ϕ0 (x) + T + u(0, t0 ; ψ).
2
In particular, at x = 1 − ε we have
π
u (1 − ε, t0 + T ; ψ) − u (0, t0 ; ψ) < ϕ0 (1 − ε) + T.
2
This contradicts (5.3) and (5.4). This proves the lemma.



Using this lemma we can prove the following interior gradient estimates.
Lemma 5.2. For any small ε > 0, there exists Tε > 0 such that
(5.5)

|ux (x, t; u0 )| ≤ M2 ,

−1 + 2ε < x < 1 − 2ε, t > Tε ,

where M2 := max{M1 , kux (·, Tε ; u0 )kL∞ } and M1 is that in (5.2).
Proof. Since u(x, t; u0 ) → ∞ as t → ∞, there exists T ′ > 0 large such that u(±1, t; u0 ) > M1
for all t > T ′ . Denote ζ(x, t) := ux (x, t; u0 ) − M1 , then ζ solves
ζt =

ζxx

ζ 2,
2
1 + ux (1 + u2x ) x

−1 < x < 1, t > 0,

and ζ(1, t) > 0 > ζ(−1, t) for t > T ′ . Using the zero number properties (cf. [1]) we conclude that,
for some Tε > T ′ , the function ζ(·, t) has only non-degenerate zeros for t ≥ Tε . Denote the largest
zero of ζ(·, t) in (−1, 1) by ρ+ (t). Due to the non-degeneracy of ρ+ (t) we see that x = ρ+ (t) is
a continuous curve. Moreover, (5.2) in the previous lemma indicates that ρ+ (t) > 1 − 2ε. In a
similar way we can find another continuous curve x = ρ− (t) for t > Tε (Tε can be chosen larger
if necessary), with ρ− (t) ∈ (−1, −1 + 2ε), such that ux (ρ− (t), t) = −M1 for t > Tε . Then, using
the maximum principle for ux in the domain D(Tε ) := {(x, t) | ρ− (t) < x < ρ+ (t), t > Tε }
we conclude that |ux (x, t; u0 )| ≤ M2 in D(Tε ). The estimate (5.5) then follows from the fact
ρ− (t) < −1 + 2ε < 1 − 2ε < ρ+ (t) for t > Tε .

5.2. Convergence of general solutions. Let {tn } be any time sequence with tn → ∞, we
consider the solution sequence {u(x, t + tn ; u0 ) − u(0, tn ; ψ)}.
For any given small ε > 0 and any τ > 0, let Tε be as that in Lemma 5.2, then (5.1) and (5.5)
imply that, for all large n, u(x, t + tn ; u0 ) − u(0, tn ; ψ) is bounded in C 1,0 ([2ε − 1, 1 − 2ε] × [−τ, τ ])
norm, and the bounds are independent of n. Using the standard parabolic theory we can even
α
have the C 2+α,1+ 2 ([2ε− 1, 1− 2ε]× [−τ, τ ]) (for any α ∈ (0, 1)) bounds for the solution sequence,
also uniform in n, and so we can find a convergent subsequence. Taking ε → 0 and τ → ∞, and
using the Cantor’s diagonal argument we conclude that, there is a subsequence of {tn }, denoted
is again by {tn }, such that
(5.6)

u(x, t + tn ; u0 ) − u(0, tn ; ψ) → W(x, t)

Denote
θ(x, t) := arctan ux (x, t), x ∈ [−1, 1], t > 0.
Then θ satisfies

θt = cos2 θ · θxx ,
−1 < x < 1, t > 0,
θ(±1, t) = ± arctan u(±1, t), t > 0.
The global existence of u implies that θ exists for all t > 0. For any T > 0, by Lemma 3.1 we
have
(5.8)

|θ(x, t)| ≤ arctan[C(T )],

x ∈ [−1, 1], t ∈ [0, T ],

and θ(±1, t) = ± arctan u(±1, t) → ± π2 as t → ∞. Moreover, by (5.6) we have

1. We claim that Θ(x, t) is a stationary solution of θt = cos2 θ · θxx . Without loss of generality
we only need to prove that Θ(x, 0) is a stationary one. Denote a := Θx (0, 0), b := Θ(0, 0)
and v(x) := ax + b, then v(x) is a stationary solution of θt = cos2 θ · θxx , and the function
ξ(x, t) := θ(x, t) − v(x) satisfies one of the following boundary conditions:

Moreover, ξ satisfies the linear equation ξt = cos2 θ · ξxx . Hence the zero number argument is
applied to conclude that ξ(x, t) has no degenerate zeros for all large t. Then using a similar
argument as in the proof of [8, Lemma 2.6] we conclude that the ω-limit Θ(x, t) − v(x) of
θ(x, t) − v(x) either satisfies (1) Θ(x, t) ≡ v(x), or satisfies (2) Θ(x, t) 6≡ v(x) and Θ(x, t) − v(x)
has no degenerate zeros for each t ∈ R. Case (2), however, contradicts the definition of v(x).
Therefore, only case (1) holds. This prove our claim.
2. Next we show that Θ(x, t) ≡ π2 x. In the previous step, we have shown that Θ(x, t) ≡
v(x) ≡ ax + b for some a, b ∈ R. If v(±1) = ± π2 , then the conclusion is proved. On the contrary,
we assume, without loss of generality that, for some x0 ∈ (0, 1) and some small δ > 0, there holds
Θ(x, t) ≡ v(x) < π2 x−πδ in x ∈ [x0 , 1). For any given small ǫ > 0, since |θ(x, tn )−Θ(x, 0)| ≤ 12 πδ
in [−1 + ǫ, 1 − ǫ] when n is sufficiently large, we have

π

arctan ux (x, tn ) = θ(x, tn ) ≤ Θ(x, 0) + πδ = v(x) + πδ < (x − δ), x ∈ [−1 + ǫ, 1 − ǫ].

Integrating the above inequalities over [x0 , 1 − ǫ] we have

u(1 − ǫ, tn ) ≤ u(x0 , tn ) +

Taking limit as n → ∞ we have

W(1 − ǫ, 0) ≤ W(x0 , 0) + ϕ0 (1 − ǫ − δ) − ϕ0 (x0 − δ).

11

Combining with (5.7) we have
ϕ0 (1 − ǫ) ≤ W(x0 , 0) + ϕ0 (1 − ǫ − δ) − ϕ0 (x0 − δ).
This is a contradiction as ǫ → 0. This proves our claim, and so Θ(x, t) ≡ πx
2 .
3. As an ω-limit of θ, the function Θ(x, t) ≡ π2 x is unique. Hence, θ(x, t) →

as t → ∞.

W(x, t) = ϕ0 (x) + K(t).
Since W(x, t) is an entire solution, by its equation we have Wt (x, t) ≡ π2 , and so K(t) = π2 t + K0
for some K0 ∈ R. By (5.7) we actually have K0 ∈ [0, π2 T ]. In summary,
π
x ∈ (−1, 1), t ∈ R.
W(x, t) = ϕ0 (x) + t + K0 ,
2
Proof of Theorem 1.1. From above discussion we see that, as n → ∞,
π
u(x, t + tn ; u0 ) − u(0, tn ; ψ) → ϕ0 (x) + t + K0 ,
2
and so
u(x, t + tn ; u0 ) − u(0, tn ; u0 )

=

[u(x, t + tn ; u0 ) − u(0, tn ; ψ)] − [u(0, tn ; u0 ) − u(0, tn ; ψ)]
π
→ ϕ0 (x) + t.
2
Since {tn } is an arbitrarily chosen time sequence tending to infinity, we conclude that
π
as s → ∞.
u(x, t + s; u0 ) − u(0, s; u0 ) → ϕ0 (x) + t,
2
This proves Theorem 1.1.

Remark 5.3. We see from Sections 4 and 5 that the zero number argument plays a key role in
the uniform interior gradient estimates, which does not rely on the boundedness of u and can be
extended to other problems with unbounded solutions (but only for one dimensional problems).
