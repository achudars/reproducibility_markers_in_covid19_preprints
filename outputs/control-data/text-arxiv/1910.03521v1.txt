DC-AC Converter-Fed Induction Motor Drive
with Fault-Tolerant Capability under Open- and
Short-Circuit Switch Failures
Masoud Farhadi, Majid Tahmasbi Fard, Mehdi Abapour, and Mehrdad Tarafdar Hagh

Abstract—In this paper, a new fault tolerant DC-AC converter-fed induction motor drive is proposed to maintain motor as close as
possible to its desired normal operation under open- and short-circuit switch failures. The operational principles for fault detection and
isolation schemes, are provided. Two control strategies including predictive control and voltage mode-controlled PWM with integraldouble-lead controller for two stage of the converter are presented in conjunction with the elaborated discussion. The control strategy
determines appropriate switching states for continuous operation of the drive after a fault. The proposed topology makes it possible to
integrate the minimal redundant hardware and full tolerance capability which is an important advantage of the proposed topology.
Moreover, the most important advantages of the proposed topology are a fast response in a fault condition and low cost of the converter
in comparison with the evaluated topologies. A Joule-integral-based method for selecting an appropriate rating of applied fuses has been
presented to provide a reliable fault-isolation operation. Also, a comparison with currently available fault-tolerant DC-AC converters is
given to show the merits of the proposed topology. Finally, the experimental results are presented to verify the validity of the theoretical
analysis and industrial feasibility of the proposed converter.

I. INTRODUCTION
Voltage source converter (VSC)-fed drives are an enabling technology in a wide range of industrial applications. However, any
type of the switch failures can lead to overall converter shutdown and results in a non-programmed maintenance. In many cases,
these interruptions have high production losses and follow-up costs. On the other hand, the past decade has witnessed increasingly
cost reduction pressure from global competition that dictates minimum reliability-oriented design margin. These have triggered a
big challenge in the VSC-fed drives and show the necessity of the development of fault-tolerant drive systems to meet the future
application trends and customer expectations. From reliability perspective, various solutions have been introduced in the literature
to improve the reliability of drive systems, e.g., active thermal control [1], [3], health management [4], [5], robustness validation
[6] and fault-tolerant operation [7]-[12]. Among these solutions, the fault-tolerant operation achieves a better compromise between
the high reliability and system cost. More recently, fault diagnosis and fault prognosis in switching devices have received intensive
research interest in the improvement of reliability. The basic idea of these processes is based on monitoring of changes in electrical
parameters. The correct and timely diagnosis can prevent fault propagation and avoid harmful results. Also, prognosis and predict
the expected time before a failure occurs, can notify controller to take appropriate actions. Failure diagnosis can be broadly
categorized as hardware redundancy-based and analytical redundancy-based diagnosis techniques. With the mature of modern
control theory, the interest of the literature is mainly in the analytical redundancy-based diagnosis techniques. Analytical
redundancy-based diagnosis techniques can be further subdivided into: i) model-based, ii) signal-based, iii) knowledge-based, and
iv) hybrid/active diagnosis techniques. In [13], [14], fault diagnostic methods were well reviewed and the recent development of
this subject can be found in [15].
Over the past several years, many fault-tolerant drive systems have been reported in the literature. The three-phase voltage
source inverter-fed drives have received considerable attention to keep the continuous operation with worsened performance
metrics (degraded postfault operation). Usually, this operation is accomplished by redundant switching states associated control
strategies [16], neutral-point shift [17], and DC-bus midpoint connection with no or few additional devices [18]. Also, the full
tolerant operation of drives with minimum additional components are investigated extensively in the literature. The full tolerant
capability is implemented via DC-bus voltage regulation [19], and adding redundant hardware with cold or hot backup operation
[20]. One of the most innovative fault-tolerant drive systems comes from the use of four-switch three-phase inverter [18], [21].
Usually, these topologies use three bidirectional switches to connect the faulty phase to the midpoint of the dc-link. The magnitude
of output voltage of these topologies in the faulty operation is reduced to half of the rated system voltage [22]. Thus, these
topologies can only be in “limp home” mode in the postfault operation. Also, the balance of output currents collapses due to the

fluctuation of the two dc-link capacitor voltages [23]. In [24], the neutral point of motor is connected to an additional fourth leg.
However, this scheme needs to three additional bidirectional switches to flow the current after faults.
To address the previously discussed issues in this paper, a fault tolerant DC-AC converter-fed induction motor drive is proposed
for switch failures. The proposed converter has the fault-tolerant capability in both open and short-circuit switch fault cases. The
voltages of dc-link capacitors are forced to stay balance by voltage mode control with third-order integral-lead controller. The
predictive control is used in the second stage of proposed converter to optimize its performance after faults occur. In this topology,
the neutral point of the motor is connected to the DC-bus midpoint via one relay and has less number of switches compared to
similar topologies. The negative sequence of stator currents are minimized, and appropriate fuse rating is calculated by a jouleintegral-based method. A comparison with other similar converters is given to show the merits of the proposed converter. Finally,
both simulation and experimental results are added to verify the theory and feasibility of the proposed converter.

II. PROPOSED CONVERTER DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION
In a three-phase induction machine, stator flux vectors are controlled to be a balanced positive sequence. However, if a phase of
the motor or a leg of inverter fails, the motor can continue to operate by two remained phases. But in this case, stator flux vectors
have negative-sequence components and double stator frequency pulsating torque. In the proposed converter, the stator flux vectors
are forced to stay balanced positive sequence. The neutral point of the motor is connected to the DC-bus midpoint to provide a
path for the zero sequence currents and an undisturbed rotating stator flux. In typical AC machines, the zero sequence circuit
consists of a very small impedance [25]. Therefore, zero-sequence components can be added to the remaining phases. The second
stage of proposed topology having a lower number of switches compared to the normal six-switch converter. However, the balance
among the output currents collapses due to the fluctuation of the two dc-link capacitor voltages. The first stage of converter tried
to control the capacitor voltages to allow for a fault tolerant operation. To maintain two balance dc-link voltages and insure superior
postfault operation, the voltages of dc-link capacitors are controlled by two third-order integral-lead controllers to minimize the
error between the desired reference outputs and the generated outputs.

Fig. 2. The current waveform of input inductor under open- and short-circuit fault.

The proposed fault-tolerant DC-AC converter-fed induction motor drive in this paper is shown in Fig. 1. The fault-tolerant
capability is added to the first stage (DC-DC stage) by introducing two redundant switches (Q'1, Q'2). The input inductor current
slope can be used to fault detection in these switches. Fig. 2 shows inductor current and switches command signals. According to
this figure, there are three modes per period for the first stage of proposed converter. In mode I, the inductor current increases,
while in mode II and mode III, it decreases and the inductor energy flows to the load. Therefore, comparison of inductor current
slope and switches command signals can be used to fault detection. After fault detection, the faulty switch is replaced by the
redundant switch and corresponding isolation relay. Recently, the isolation relays are embedded in semiconductor switch modules
that must be developed [26].
There are many kinds of diagnostic methods for open circuit fault detection in the literature. One of the best methods that can
be used in the second stage of proposed converter is modified normalized DC current method [27]. This method comes from the
fact that during the normal operation, average of phase current in a period is zero. The normalized DC current is given by:

a ,b ,c 

n m 1

(2)

B a ,b ,c ,1 

2 m
 I a,b ,c (m ).sin( n )
n m 1

(3)

Where Aa,b,c,1 and Ba,b,c,1 are the corresponding fundamental components of the output currents. Experience shows that best
threshold of normalized DC current is 0.45 [27]. The identification of open switches using this method is described in Table I.
After open circuit fault detection in a switch, the controller turns off the complementary switch, turns on RN and enables postfault
predictive control that is explained in detail in section II. These are done to complete the converter reconfiguration. Fig. 3 shows
the simplified schematic of the proposed converter in the postfault condition. It is important to note that the postfault control
strategy for short-circuit fault is same as the open-circuit failure case. In the case of short-circuit failure, the controller turns on the
complementary switch which creates a shoot-through loop and blows the corresponding fast fuse. The short-circuit faults can cause
catastrophic consequences within a very short time. Therefore in case of short-circuit failure, the fault detection and isolation must
be very fast. During the last decade, various IGBT short-circuit fault diagnostic methods have been proposed based on the control
of the collector-emitter voltage, the gate-emitter voltage, and the induced voltage across the emitter stray inductance [28]-[30].
One of the most common diagnostic methods is desaturation detection that uses only a simple sensing diode for collector voltage
detection. However, it is criticized for several limitations. One of the limitations is that it takes time to charge the capacitor by the
internal charge current and therefore it is not appropriate for the high-speed applications [31]. Another main diagnostic method is
gate voltage sensing method, which needs complicated protection circuit [29]. It turns out that each method has its disadvantages.
Fig. 4 shows the general turn-on characteristic of IGBT under normal and faulty conditions. In the proposed converter, shortcircuit faults can be detected by comparing the turn-on characteristic of IGBT with a standard characteristic. As shown in Fig. 4,
the turn-on characteristic of IGBT can be divided into six sections. In section 4, the gate-emitter voltage (VGE) is decreased because
of the Miller effect. However, under short-circuit fault condition, VGE is increased in this section. Therefore, the short-circuit fault
of the IGBT is detected by comparing gate voltage with a reference voltage. The short-circuit failure detection circuit is shown in
Fig. 5. The fault detection circuit consists a difference generator in series with a fault detector that integrates the generated
difference between gate-emitter voltage and the reference voltage. If the short-circuit fault occurs, the gate voltage is clamped by
a Zener diode to reduce the fault current. Then, the gate voltage is turned off by a high resistor after a short delay. The gate-emitter
voltage comparison method doesn’t require any blanking time nor the connection between power circuit and detection circuit.
Also, the gate-emitter voltage comparison circuit can be integrated into one gate drive IC.

III. POST-FAULT CONTROL STRATEGY
The proposed converter is composed of two input switches (Q1, Q2), two redundant switches (Q'1, Q'2) and six output switches
(S1, S2, …, S6). The first group of switches including Q1 and Q2 is controlled by a voltage mode controller to regulate the dc-link
voltage and to attenuate its ripple. To better analysis of this controller, small signal equivalent circuit for the first stage of converter
have been constructed and transfer functions are calculated. The third group of switches is controlled by the predictive control to
select the most appropriate switching states. The detailed analysis of both controllers is provided in the following.
A. Predictive Control

as following:

Neglecting damping effects, the rate of change of mechanical speed is directly affected by torque. Therefore, dynamic model of

3) Model predictive control
Due to emerging fast microprocessors and distinctive advantages of model predictive control (MPC) method such as developing
control problem as an optimization problem, the capability of defining multi-objective cost functions and higher flexibility, this

method is likely going to receive more attention than before [33]. In this paper, the MPC method is used to control the proposed
system and generate gating signals of the inverter for both normal and postfault conditions. MPC predicts variables for the next
sampling period then by evaluating all possible switching states, selects the optimum one which minimize the cost function [34].
Fig. 6 shows the schematic control system. As shown in this figure, mechanical angular speed is compared with the reference value
then a proportional-integral (PI) controller integrates the generated difference between mechanical speed and reference speed.
Finally, switches command signals are generated by the predictive control block.

a)

Stator and rotor flux estimation

In model predictive control, values of the electromagnetic torque T*e, stator flux magnitude  s* , and stator current is, at the
present sampling step, are required. But stator flux data cannot be measured and therefore they should be estimated at present
sample time. From (5) and by using Euler discretizing method, it is possible to estimate stator flux as follows:

 s  k  = s  k  1 +Ts vs  k  -R s Ts is  k 

(14)

The possible issue that this system may encounter in low-speed ranges, originates from the theory of voltage-based flux
estimation. Not only measurement devices introduce noise or offset errors, but also there may be a mismatch between estimator’s
resistance parameter (Rs) and actual stator resistance which leads estimator to inaccuracy especially in low speeds. However, using
Euler method to discretize first-order systems is mathematically more accurate and acceptable than high-order systems due to
considerable error that is introduced in high-order systems.
By replacing i r in (8) into (7), estimated rotor flux is obtained as:

(15)

Prediction stage

The main objective of the model-based predictive controller in the proposed system is to control stator flux and electromagnetic
torque. Thus, in addition to determining present sample time variables, torque and stator flux at the next sampling interval have to
be predicted. Stator flux at (k + 1) can be predicted as follows:

 s  k  1 = s  k  +Ts vs  k  -R s Ts is  k 

(16)

Also, electromagnetic torque at (k + 1) is expressed as:





Te  k  1  1.5 p Im  s  k  1 .is  k  1

(17)

Where, stator current at (k + 1) is obtained from discretizing (9):

Finally, the procedure of obtaining predicted variables is repeated for all possible switching states and corresponding resultant
voltage vectors.
c)

Cost function defining

After predicting variables, the next step is to define cost function based on control objectives as a parameter for evaluating each
voltage vector. Then, the most appropriate vector which results minimum cost function will be selected and applied to the system.
In this paper, the cost function of MPC and weighting factor (λ) are defined as follows:

Delay compensation

Contrary to computer-based simulations where there isn’t any delay between calculation and implementation, when it comes to
experimental execution, one sample time delay is introduced due to the time-consuming a large number of calculations and selected
switching pattern is applied with one sample time delay. To deal with this problem, besides predicting variables at (k + 1), they
should also be predicted at (k + 2) in the same manner. Consequently, the cost function has to be changed as follows:

g  Te*  Te  k  2     s*  s  k  2 

B. Voltage-Mode Control
The output of the first stage of the converter must be constant with maximum current capability. To this purpose, the voltage
mode-controlled PWM with third-order integral-lead controller is applied that shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, the loop consists
of a pulse-width modulator in series with an error-detector (error amplifier) that amplify and invert the difference between output
and reference. Since the transfer function of internal error-detector is not achievable. Therefore, despite the fact that internal errordetector provided in most PWM chips, for best performance, a third-order external error-detector with one pole at the origin and
two zero–pole pairs is used and internal error-detector is wired as a buffer. Controller should provide desired transient response,
sufficient gain margin (G.M ≥ 10 dB) and sufficient phase margin (60◦ ≤ P.M ≤ 80◦) [35]. These allow a good compromise between
fast transient response, stability and wider closed-loop bandwidth.
The first stage of the converter is highly nonlinear. So, small-signal analysis of the first stage of converter is presented that allow
to the power electronic designers to choose a desired gain margin and phase margin, and then find out the needed component
values to achieve these margins. Small-signal model and related block diagram of the first stage of the proposed converter are
shown in Fig. 9. Based on this figure, the impedances of the controller are given as follows:

IV. FUSE SELECTION PROCESS
The field experience confirms that power switches are the most vulnerable components in the power electronics systems.
Moreover, short-circuit switch failure is the major type of failure that affects the reliability of power electronic systems [36]-[39].
For short-circuit fault isolation, several solutions is reported in past literature. A fast-acting fuse as a one-time sacrificial component
has been used in many of these solutions. But, issues like fuse design is not discussed, while correct fuse selection is vital to protect
the converter from overload and short-circuit currents. To provide reliable protection by a fuse, appropriate melting time of the
fuse must be determined by comparing melting characteristic of fuse with the thermal characteristic of the circuit.
The equivalent circuit of the proposed converter during postfault operation is illustrated in Fig. 11. Using this figure, we obtain
the following second-order differential equation with iF as the dependent variable:
d 2iF
1 diF



iF  0
2 R f dt LC
dt 2

(28)

Where Rf is equal to the sum of path resistances. As shown in Fig. 4, IGBT has nonlinear characteristic and after fault its current
is saturated to a specific current, also there is a constant voltage V dc 2  across the IGBT. Therefore after fault, IGBT can be
modeled as a nonlinear resistance R f which is constant due to constant current and voltage and we have:

A typically withstand factor curve for industrial fuses is shown in Fig. 12 [40]. By taking into account the withstand factor and

V. COMPARISON OF THE PROPOSED CONVERTER WITH OTHER SIMILAR TOPOLOGIES
In this section, the proposed DC-AC converter-fed induction motor drive is compared with some other DC-AC fault-tolerant
converters recommended in [16], [21], ,[24], [41]-[44]. For comparison, some important factors are considered: the number of
redundant hardware, the number of used switches in normal operation, full postfault operating performance, cost and complexity
of configuration. Table III summarizes comparison of DC-AC fault-tolerant converters recommended in [16], [21], [24], [41]-[44]
that include requirements, benefits, and cost. For comparison topology purposes, the bidirectional switches are considered to be a
back-to-back connection of two IGBT modules in the common-collector configuration. For this comparison, it will be assumed
that limp-home function is allowable after faults. It is important to note that the degraded performances are
considered acceptable when in postfault operation, 0.5 p.u. phase voltage is achieved with space vector modulation (SVM) without
overmodulation. In an effort to quantify the total rating of switches associated with each of the compared converters, a normalized
overrating factor is considered that can be a good measure to compare the economic justification of converters. The normalized
overrating factor (NOF) of converters is expressed as:

NOF 

kVA rating of all switches
kVA rating of standard six-switch converter

(33)

In this definition, it is assumed that switches of the standard six-switch converter have to block the dc bus voltage and carry a
peak phase current. Also for this comparison, the kVA of diodes are divided by two that reflect an engineering approximation to
the actual cost of diodes compared to switches.
Considering Table III, it can be concluded that the proposed converter is one of the most promising DC-AC fault-tolerant
converters. Based on this comparison, it is obvious that the number of used hardware of the proposed converter is less than other
converters. This advantage leads to the reduction of circuit cost and size. Also, the proposed converter can detect, identify, and
handle both types of switch failure (open- and short-circuit). Note that full redundant design (considering open-circuit and shortcircuit) of proposed converters in [21] and [42], even have more power switches than system-level redundancy case. It was shown
that this topology is suitable for applications where full postfault operating performance is vital. Moreover, it is clear that the cost
and complexity of this converter have been significantly reduced in comparison with other converters.

VI. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section presents a set of simulation and experimental results to validate the proposed converter. The proposed fault-tolerant
DC-AC converter-fed induction motor drive is simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink software environment and verified using a
laboratory prototype without fault detection circuits, which is not taken into account because of laboratory constraints and scope
of paper. The parameters of proposed converter are listed in Table V in the Appendix. Fundamental sample time of simulation is
selected to be 5μs and predictive controller is updated every 20μs. In order to observe transient response of converter, it is assumed
that at t=2 s, phase A of second stage of converter has experienced faulty condition due to upper or lower switch failure and isolated.
In practice to do this, controller of prototype turns off the phase A switches which isolate phase A from converter. In Fig. 13 (a),
the simulation results of line currents waveforms during operation with an open-circuit leg (phase A) in the second stage of
converter are presented. Fig. 13 (a) clearly shows the currents transition from fault-free condition to postfault conditions and also
demonstrates that the line currents are nearly sinusoidal and their magnitudes are increased. At t = 2 s, when the postfault strategy
is activated, the line currents phases are shifted that makes it possible to tracking reference electromagnetic torque and stator flux.
As shown in Fig. 13 (a), if one phase is open-circuited, “disturbance-free” control is possible if two other phases’ magnitudes is
increased to 1.69 times their previous values. In this case, the rotating MMF will be maintained after fault. The stator flux locus in
the αβ plane is shown in Fig. 13 (b). As it can be seen in this figure, the shape of flux trajectory is kept same and also amplitude of
stator flux is controlled quite well at its required. As shown in Fig. 13 (c), the electromagnetic torque waveform remain similar to
their pre-fault condition. Also, the midpoint current is shown in Fig. 13 (d).

The amplitude of the negative sequence of line currents, with and without activating the post-fault strategy, is shown in Fig. 14.
Based on this figure, it can be seen when the fault occurs; the converter cannot properly operate without post-fault strategy since
the negative sequence currents, in this case, generate a considerable backward rotating flux, pulsating torque, vibration, and
acoustic noise. Nevertheless, with the activation of post-fault strategy, the amplitude of negative sequence is reduced from 3.55 to
0.1.

The experimental setup, consisting of a 1.5KW three-phase induction motor, control board (Cortex-A8 AM335), incremental
encoder, and the power circuit of proposed converter. GT60M303, MBR3045PT and BTA16-B are employed as the power IGBTs,
power diodes and triacs, respectively. Due to the hardware limitation, DC input voltage is obtained from the series connection of
three DC power supply in order to increase current capability. The switch failure is emulated by clamping the gating signal at “0”.
However, small sampling time can lead to high quality, but the sampling period of the predictive control system is set to 100μs to
achieve a compromise between practicability and high quality. Despite the low sampling frequency, there is sufficient time for
implementation of the predictive control scheme because of low number of the switching states. To avoid calamitous influences
of switching ripples, the sampling instants are synchronized with the middle of the on-time of the control command signal. The
experimental waveforms of line currents through the induction motor during the postfault operation are presented in Fig. 15, which
closely match with the simulation results (see Fig. 13-a). As discussed in Section III, the voltage mode-controller with third-order
integral-lead controller is used to make the dc-link voltage more constant and minimize the fluctuation of the two dc-link capacitor
voltages, which can be seen from Fig. 16. Also, experimental waveform of input inductor current during fault-tolerant operation is
shown in Fig. 17. Fig. 18 shows the dynamic response of the proposed converter in postfault condition. The variation of speed is
depicted in this figure. It can be seen that the method has the most effective performance at nominal speed.

VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a new fault tolerant DC-AC converter-fed induction motor drive is proposed with minimal part-count increase.
The operating principles of the proposed converter have been discussed in detail. The reliability of the proposed topology is
increased with minimum investment cost that show the economic justification of proposed converter. Two control strategies for
two stage of converter are presented in conjunction with elaborated discussion. The voltage mode-controlled PWM with integraldouble-lead controller is applied in first stage of converter. Small-signal analysis of first stage of converter with closed-loop voltage
mode-controlled PWM is presented. The predictive control for the second stage of converter are investigated. This control method
is simple and allows for a reliable operation of the drive. The control scheme provides the continuity of service of the converter
while maintaining acceptable electromagnetic torque and stator flux. It is important to note that negative sequence of stator currents
are minimized. So in practice, no pulsating torque is produced by machine. The appropriate rate of applied fuses are determined
by a Joule-integral-based method for converter requirements. It is important to note that converter can handle overload events by
correct fuse selection that must be developed. A comparison with currently available fault-tolerant DC-AC converters was given
that prove the merits of proposed converter. Finally, the experimental results were given for the faulty drive to clarify the theory
and feasibility of the proposed converter. The achieved results show both the full postfault operating performance and the prompt
transition from a fault condition, which could fit for many industrial applications. The control scheme presented is general and can
be used in any type of ac drive including induction, wound field synchronous, synchronous reluctance, and permanent magnet
motor drives while in other cases it may be difficult to get a superior postfault operating performance.
