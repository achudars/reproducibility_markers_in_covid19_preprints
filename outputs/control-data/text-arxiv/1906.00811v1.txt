ABSTRACT

We present the results of our photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the intermediate-luminosity optical transient AT 2017jfs. At
peak, the object reaches an absolute magnitude of Mg = −15.46 ± 0.15 mag and a bolometric luminosity of 5.5 × 1041 erg s−1 . Its light
curve has the double-peak shape typical of luminous red novae (LRNe), with a narrow first peak bright in the blue bands, while the
second peak is longer-lasting and more luminous in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. During the first peak, the spectrum shows a
blue continuum with narrow emission lines of H and Fe II. During the second peak, the spectrum becomes cooler, resembling that of a
K-type star, and the emission lines are replaced by a forest of narrow lines in absorption. About 5 months later, while the optical light
curves are characterized by a fast linear decline, the NIR ones show a moderate rebrightening, observed until the transient disappears
in solar conjunction. At these late epochs, the spectrum becomes reminiscent of that of M-type stars, with prominent molecular
absorption bands. The late-time properties suggest the formation of some dust in the expanding common envelope or an IR echo from
foreground pre-existing dust. We propose that the object is a common-envelope transient, possibly the outcome of a merging event in
a massive binary, similar to NGC4490-2011OT1.

1. Introduction
Red Novae (RNe) form a family of optical transients spanning an enormous range of luminosities. This includes faint
objects with absolute peak magnitudes MV from −4 to −6.5
mag, such as OGLE 2002-BLG-360 (Tylenda et al. 2013)
and V1309 Sco (Mason et al. 2010; Tylenda et al. 2011),
intermediate-luminosity events (MV & −10 mag) like V838 Mon
(Munari et al. 2002; Goranskij et al. 2002; Kimeswenger et
al. 2002; Crause et al. 2003), and relatively luminous objects
such as NGC4490-2011OT1 (Smith et al. 2016), that can reach
MV ≈ −15 mag. Objects brighter than MV = −10 mag are conventionally named luminous red novae1 (LRNe; for a review, see
Pastorello et al. 2019, and references therein).
Although the physical processes triggering these outbursts
have been debated, there is growing evidence that RNe and their
more luminous counterparts are produced by the coalescence of
stars with different masses following a common-envelope phase
(e.g., Kochanek et al. 2014; Pejcha et al. 2016, 2017; MacLeod et
al. 2017, 2018). In particular, the inspiralling motion of the sec⋆

The alternative naming ‘luminous red variable’ was also used in the
past (e.g., Martini et al. 1999).

ondary was revealed by the long-term monitoring of V1309 Sco
(Tylenda et al. 2011).
The recent discovery of LRNe suggests that common envelope ejections and/or merging events may also happen in more
massive close binary systems (Smith et al. 2016; Mauerhan et
al. 2018), with major implications for the evolution of the resulting merger. In this context, here we report the results of our
follow-up campaign of a LRN recently discovered in the galaxy
NGC 4470: AT 2017jfs.

2. AT 2017jfs, its host galaxy, and reddening
AT 2017jfs2 was discovered by Gaia on 2017 December 26.13
UT (MJD = 58113.13, Delgado et al. 2017) at a Gaia G-band
magnitude 17.17 ± 0.20. No source was detected at the transient
position on 2017 November 30 down to a limiting magnitude of
21.5. The transient was located at α = 12h 29m 37s.79 and δ =
+07◦49′ 35′′. 18 (equinox J2000.0), in the almost face-on, earlytype spiral galaxy NGC 4470.
The source was tentatively classified by the extended-Public
ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects (ePESSTO;
Smarrt et al. 2015) as a type-IIn supernova (SN IIn) or a SN
impostor (Bufano et al. 2018), and for this reason it was desig2
The object is known by multiple survey designations, including
Gaia17dkh, PS17fqp, ATLAS18aat.

nated with a SN name (SN 2017jfs). In this paper, we show it to
be a LRN, hence we adopt the label AT 2017jfs.
The distance to NGC 4470 is somewhat controversial, and
the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)3 gives a number
of discrepant estimates based on the Tully-Fisher method, ranging from 11.6 to 34.6 Mpc, with an average value of 18.76 ±
6.6 Mpc (corresponding to a distance modulus µ = 31.25 ± 0.70
mag). Given the uncertainty in the Tully-Fisher estimates, we
prefer to adopt a kinematic distance d = 35.2 ± 2.7 Mpc (corrected for Virgo Infall and estimated adopting a standard cosmology with H0 = 73 km s−1 Mpc−1 ), hence µ = 32.73 ± 0.15
mag. This estimate also agrees with the distance d ∼ 34.7 Mpc
reported by Koliopanos et al. (2017).
The Galactic line-of-sight reddening is modest, E(B − V) =
0.022 mag (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). Our early spectra do
not have high signal to noise ratios (S/Ns), and therefore the host
galaxy reddening cannot be well constrained. However, prominent absorption features of Na ID are not visible, suggesting a
modest host galaxy reddening contribution. Later spectra with
higher S/N show only a narrow Na ID in absorption centered
at 5884Å (rest wavelength), hence likely a feature intrinsic to
AT 2017jfs. For this reason, we adopt E(B − V) = 0.022 mag as
the total reddening towards AT 2017jfs.

3. Photometric evolution
The follow-up campaign started soon after the classification of
AT 2017jfs, and continued for about 7 months. Photometry data
were reduced following standard prescriptions (see, e.g., Cai et
al. 2018), using the SNOoPy package (Cappellaro 2014). The
magnitudes are listed in Table 1, available at the CDS, which
contains the following information: Column 1 lists the date of
the observation, Column 2 lists the MJD, Columns 3 to 11 give
the optical and near-infrared (NIR) magnitudes, and Column 12
reports a numeric code for the instrumental configuration. The
multi-band light curves are shown in Fig. 1. The Sloan-u light
curve shows a monotonic decline after maximum, with an average rate of 6.5 ± 0.9 mag (100 d)−1 . The photometric evolution
in the other bands is somewhat different. The g-band maximum

is constrained to MJD = 58114.8 ± 1.8 (2017 December 27.8
UT) through a low-order polynomial fit (at g = 17.35 ± 0.02
mag, hence Mg = −15.46 ± 0.15 mag).
The g-band light curve has a rise time to maximum of about
4 d, followed by a rapid decline (6.5 ± 0.2 mag (100 d)−1 ) until ∼50 d. The light curve follows a plateau-like evolution until ∼110 d when it begins a faster decline (7.0 ± 0.4 mag (100
d)−1 ) that lasts until it has faded below the detection threshold.
The evolution in the Johnson B and V bands is similar to the
g band, although the V-band light curve shows a low-contrast
second peak, broader than the early one.
The light curve is remarkably different in the red and NIR
bands. The transient reaches a peak at r = 17.19 ± 0.05 mag on
MJD = 58115.6, followed by a fast decline (6.3 ± 0.3 mag (100
d)−1 ) lasting three weeks and reaching a minimum at r = 18.32±
0.07 mag. Subsequently, from about 50 d after maximum, the rband luminosity rises again and reaches a second maximum on
MJD = 58209.0, at r = 17.68 ± 0.03 mag. This second peak is
much broader than the early one. Later on, from 110 to 200 d
after the first peak, the r-band light curve declines with a rate of
3.90 ± 0.04 mag (100 d)−1 . The i-band light curve is very similar,
with the two peaks reaching comparable luminosities.
The NIR light curves have a second maximum, brighter than
the early one. As an additional feature, GROND (Greiner et al.
2008) observations reveal a moderate rebrightening of the NIR
light curves from ∼170 to 220 d. Although we do not have very
late spectroscopic observations to support this (Sect. 4), a latetime NIR luminosity excess can be associated with the formation
of new dust or IR echoes, occasionally observed in LRNe at late
phases (see, e.g., Banerjee et al. 2015; Exter et al. 2016). The late
NIR brightening may also be a consequence of the transition to
the brown (L-type) supergiant stage, as happened for V838 Mon
(Evans et al. 2003; Munari et al. 2007), although this scenario
does not comfortably explain the late blue-shift of the Hα emission observed in the late spectra of AT 2017jfs (see Sect. 4).

4. Spectral evolution
We collected 14 epochs of optical spectroscopy, spanning about
six months of the evolution of AT 2017jfs. Information on the
instrumental configurations is given in Table A.1. Our spectral
sequence of AT 2017jfs is presented in Fig. 2, while the comparison with a few LRNe at similar epochs and the line identification are shown in Fig. 3. We remark that the transient lies in a
crowded region of NGC 4470, rich in nearby sources. As a consequence, the late spectra show some contamination from host
galaxy lines.
The spectral evolution of AT 2017jfs follows a three-phase
behavior, as observed in other extra-galactic LRNe. In particular, we note a remarkable similarity with NGC4490-2011OT1
(Smith et al. 2016; Pastorello et al. 2019) at all phases. At early
epochs (until 3-4 weeks after the first g-band peak) the spectrum
of AT 2017jfs shows a blue continuum, dominated by prominent
H lines in emission, with a Lorentzian profile and a full width
at half maximum velocity vFWH M ∼ 700 km s−1 (corrected for
spectral resolution). In this period, the temperature inferred from
a black-body fit to the spectral continuum, T BB, decreases from
about 7800 ± 700 K (in the +9.5d spectrum) to 6000 ± 600 K (in
the +23.4 d spectrum). Emission lines from a number of Fe II
multiplets are also detected, along with O I. The Ca II NIR triplet
is also identified in emission, while the H&K feature, which is
usually prominent in absorption in other LRNe (see Fig. 3, top
panel), is marginally detected in AT 2017jfs.

Fig. 2. Left: Spectral evolution of AT 2017jfs soon after the first blue
maximum (top), around the second, red maximum (center), and at late
phases (bottom). Right: Expanded image of the Hα region in the velocity space. The vertical line marks the rest wavelength position of Hα at
the same phases as the left panels (after correcting for the host galaxy
redshift z = 0.007809 as reported in NED). Only the highest-S\N spectra are shown. The absorptions visible at velocities 0 and +1000 km s−1
in late spectra can be partly due to an over-subtraction of the unresolved
Hα and [N II] λ6583 from the host galaxy background.

With time, the continuum becomes redder and the spectrum
experiences an evident metamorphosis. During the second peak,
from ∼50 d to 4 months, the red spectrum (T bb = 4300 ± 700 K
at 82.3 d) is dominated by a forest of metal lines in absorption.
The H lines become much weaker, showing now a P Cygni profile (see Fig. 2, left panel), although an over-subtraction of the
narrow Hα emission from a nearby H II region may affect the
apparent strength of the absorption. The spectrum in this phase
is reminiscent of intermediate-type stars (e.g., late G to K types).
We identify a number of metal lines (from Fe II, Ti II, Sc II and
Ba II multiplets), along with the Na I 5889, 5895 Å doublet (see
Fig. 3, mid panel). The O I and the NIR Ca II triplet are now
seen in absorption. The velocity of the narrow Fe II lines deduced from the wavelengths of absorptions is about 450 km s−1 .
Some of the absorption lines visible at this stage are likely due
to neutral metals, in particular Fe I at red wavelengths.
From about 5 months after maximum (hence during the
steep, late luminosity decline; see Sect. 3), the spectrum changes
again, becoming much redder (T bb ≈ 2950 ± 150 K at 157 d)
and closer to that of an M-type star. Hα is now mostly in emission, with an evident blue-shift of its peak (by about 400 km
s−1 ; see Fig. 2, right), and a deep absorption at the rest velocity. While an over-subtraction of the contaminant H II region
can be responsible in part for this absorption, the strong blueshift of the emission is real. The Hα profile is similar to that
of LRN NGC4490-2011OT1 about 200 days after maximum
(Smith et al. 2016), whose bluest emission peak was shifted by
−280 km s−1 . Following Smith et al. (2016), the development
of a blue-shifted component in emission would be consistent
with an expanding, shock-heated line-forming region, possibly

peak (top panel), around the red peak (mid panel), and at late phases
(about 5-6 months after the blue peak; bottom panel). The spectra of the
comparison objects are taken from Pastorello et al. (2019), Blagorodnova et al. (2017), and Kankare et al. (2015). The identification of
the molecular bands is performed following Kirkpatrick et al. (1991),
Valenti et al. (1998), Martini et al. (1999), and Barsukova et al. (2014).

with aspherical symmetry. A peculiar geometry or, alternatively,
the formation of dust hiding the rear emitting region (or both)
may explain the late Hα profile for both NGC4490-2011OT1
and AT 2017jfs. Higher-resolution spectra and a wider temporal
monitoring would help in discriminating the different scenarios.
As observed in similar transients (e.g., Pastorello et al. 2019),
the late-time spectrum is also characterized by broad absorption bands. The features are generally identified as being due
to molecules, in particular TiO and VO, although CN and CaH
are not ruled out (see Fig. 3, top panel).

5. Evolution of the temperature and the radius
The double-peaked light-curve evolution and the major spectroscopic transition from an SN IIn-like spectrum to that of a latetype star are two remarkable properties of LRNe (Pastorello et
al. 2019). The photometric information in particular can be used
to study how the spectral energy distribution (SED), the effective
temperature, and the photospheric radius evolve with time.
To this aim, the SED is computed for a few representative
epochs, and the observed data are fitted by a single black-body
function. The early-time (near the blue maximum) SEDs do not
contain u, i, z-band and NIR observations, while u-band data
are not available from about two months after peak. Finally, the

fluxes in the blue optical bands are not available at very late
phases, because the object was below the detection thresholds
in those filters. The resulting black-body fits are shown in Fig. 4
(left panel). Until about three months after maximum, observations are well modeled by black-body fits, although from ∼3-4
weeks the line-blanketed u-band sits below the adopted models.
After the red peak, a single black body is not sufficient to accurately represent the observed SEDs in the blue region (see the
inset in the left panel of Fig. 4). This happens when the NIR light
curves of AT 2017jfs start a new rise before the object is in heliacal conjunction. This is possibly due to the contribution of a second black-body component peaking at longer wavelengths that
cannot be properly fitted because of the inadequate wavelength
coverage of our observed SED, in particular towards the midand far-infrared domains. The nature of this putative cold component is unclear. It is possibly due to an IR echo from distant
pre-existing dust or, more likely, to the condensation of newly
formed dust, as suggested by the early appearance of molecular bands in the spectra and the strong blue-shift of the late Hα
emission (Section 4).
The evolution of the effective temperature is shown in the
top-right panel of Fig. 4. The temperature remains roughly constant at about 7000 K during the blue peak. Soon after maximum,
the temperature declines very rapidly, reaching ∼4500 K at 50 d.
Later on, the temperature fades more slowly, down to about 2300
K at 215 d, although this value is uncertain, as it was inferred
from a poor, single black-body fit (see inset in Fig. 4, left panel).
The temporal evolution of the bolometric luminosity of
AT 2017jfs, inferred by integrating the black-body fluxes over
the entire wavelength range, is shown in Fig. 4 (mid-right panel),
and is compared with the pseudo-bolometric curves obtained by
accounting for the contribution of the optical plus NIR bands
(uvoir), and the optical bands (opt) only. For the first peak we
obtain a bolometric luminosity Lbol ∼ 5.5 × 1041 erg s−1 , which
is comparable to those of other intermediate-luminosity optical
transients (Berger et al. 2009; Soker & Kashi 2012) or faint corecollapse SNe (Pastorello et al. 2004; Spiro et al. 2014). After the
post-peak decline (with a minimum of Lbol ∼ 1.5 × 1041 erg
s−1 ), the bolometric light curve rises to the second peak with
Article number, page 4 of 7

Lbol ∼ 3.2 × 1041 erg s−1 , and then declines again. After ∼150
d, in coincidence with the late NIR brightening, the bolometric light curve flattens to Lbol ∼ 1041 erg s−1 . We note that the
bolometric luminosity of the blue peak in AT 2017jfs is twice
that of the red peak. This is a major difference with NGC44902011OT1, where the red peak was twice as luminous as the early
blue peak (see Pastorello et al. 2019, their Fig. 11). This discrepancy is likely a consequence of the large UV contribution
during the blue peak that was not accounted for in the pseudobolometric light curve of NGC4490-2011OT1.
Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, with the luminosities and
temperatures estimated above, we infer the evolution of the radius at the photosphere for AT 2017jfs (Fig. 4, bottom-right
panel). The radius R at blue peak slightly exceeds 5 × 1014 cm
(R ≈ 7700 R⊙ ). After a modest decline, the radius rapidly increases reaching ∼ 19000 R⊙ at about 80 d, and then remains
roughly constant until ∼ 6 months. During the last month of the
monitoring campaign of AT 2017jfs, we observe a further fast
increase in the photospheric radius, which exceeds 33000 R⊙ at
215 d. This rise in the photospheric radius and the dramatic decline of the effective temperature at very late phases favor the
formation of new dust, like in RN V838 Mon (Bond 2003). This
is also consistent with the blueshift of the Hα emission shown in
Fig. 2 (left).

6. Discussion and conclusions
Pastorello et al. (2019) presented optical data for a wide sample of extra-galactic LRNe, all of them showing double-peaked
light curves with maximum absolute magnitudes MV in the range
−12.5 to −15 mag. They discuss the observational similarity of
LRNe with fainter (MV > −10 mag) RNe discovered in the
Milky Way, and agree with Kochanek et al. (2014) and Smith
et al. (2016) that all these transients are explained in a similar
binary-interaction framework. Most likely, they result from stellar merging events that occurred after the ejection of the common
envelope. Lipunov et al. (2017) and MacLeod et al. (2017) discuss the structured light curves of LRNe. A plausible scenario
for the double-peak light curve of AT 2017jfs invokes an initial
mass outflow as a consequence of the merging event, followed by
a later interaction with the common envelope. This would produce the first luminosity peak and the spectra resembling those
of type-IIn SNe. During the second peak, the photospheric radius
(∼ 2 × 104 R⊙ ) is likely coincident with that of the ejected common envelope. With the temperature decline, the H recombines,
and the released radiation determines the broad red maximum.
According to Metzger & Pejcha (2017), the double-peak light
curve of LRNe is explained with a modest mass ejection following the coalescence, with the early peak being due to the release
of thermal energy from the fast ejecta in free expansion along the
polar axes. The late red peak would result from shock-powered
emission in the collision between the fast shell and pre-existing
material in the equatorial plane. This would also generate a cool
dense shell, which is an ideal site for late dust formation, as
likely observed in AT 2017jfs. Barsukova et al. (2014) provided
a somewhat different interpretation. The rapid coalescence generates a violent forward shock which leads the photospheric temperature to largely increase, producing the blue light curve peak.
This phase is followed by the fast adiabatic expansion of the envelope with thermal energy carried out with some delay to the
outer layers producing the broad red maximum.
Kochanek et al. (2014) proposed that the wide range of peak
luminosities observed in RN/LRN events (over 4 orders of magnitudes in luminosity) is tightly connected with the total mass

A. Pastorello et al.: LRN AT 2017jfs in NGC 4470

of the binary system, with faint RNe having progenitor systems
of the order of 1 M⊙ and intermediate-luminosity events like
V838 Mon of . 10 M⊙ . Luminous transients such as AT 2017jfs,
SNhunt248 (Mauerhan et al. 2015; Kankare et al. 2015), and
NGC 4490-2011OT1 (Smith et al. 2016; Pastorello et al. 2019)
likely arise from more massive binaries (up to 50 − 60 M⊙ ,
Mauerhan et al. 2018). While for AT 2017jfs we do not have
any direct information on the progenitor system and the preoutburst light-curve evolution, its luminous light curve would
favor a massive binary as precursor of AT 2017jfs.
A possible correlation between outflow velocities and lightcurve peak luminosities for merger candidates is presented in
Mauerhan et al. (2018), but includes intermediate-luminosity red
transients similar to SN 2008S and M85-OT whose nature is debated (e.g., Botticella et al. 2009; Kasliwal et al. 2011; Kulkarni et al. 2007; Pastorello et al. 2007). Since for AT 2017jfs
we measure an expansion velocity vFWH M ≈ 700 km s−1 and
log (L peak /L⊙ ) ≈ 7.2, the object is positioned very close to
NGC4490-2011OT1 in their Fig. 12, hence supporting the parameters trend discussed in Mauerhan et al. (2018).
While RNe from relatively low-mass stars are expected to be
quite common, luminous events are extremely rare (Kochanek et
al. 2014). In particular, following Kochanek et al. (2014, their
Fig. 3), AT 2017jfs-like events would occur at a rate of < 10−4
yr−1 within 1 Mpc. Therefore, within a volume of 40 Mpc in radius, we should find about three events per year, which is roughly
consistent with observations. In fact, while we observed at least
four RNe with MV & −10 mag in the Milky Way in the past two
decades (V4332 Sgr, V838 Mon, V1309 Sco and OGLE-2002BLG-360), LRNe brighter than MV < −10 mag were never discovered in our Galaxy, with only less that ten objects observed
within 40 Mpc in the past few years.
Due to the limited number of objects discovered so far and
incomplete data sets, RNe/LRNe are still not fully understood.
Well-sampled, multi-band light curves extending to longer wavelengths and high-S/N spectra with good resolution are essential tools for improving their characterization. Discovering new
LRNe at larger distances and RNe outside the Local Group is
crucial for understanding the physics of these objects, and for
providing reliable intrinsic rates. These are key objectives of the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST Science Collaboration
2009) and other future-generation surveys.
