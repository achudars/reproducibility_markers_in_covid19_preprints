ABELIAN GROUP ACTIONS AND HYPERSMOOTH
EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS
MICHAEL R. COTTON
Abstract. We show that a Borel action of a standard Borel group which is
isomorphic to a sum of a countable abelian group with a countable sum of real
lines and circles induces an orbit equivalence relation which is hypersmooth,
i.e., Borel reducible to eventual agreement on sequences of reals, and it follows
from this result along with the structure theory for locally compact abelian
groups that Borel actions of Polish LCA groups induce orbit equivalence relations which are essentially hyperfinite, extending a result of Gao and Jackson
and answering a question of Ding and Gao.

1. Introduction
To compare classification problems we need to be able to decide how complicated
the corresponding equivalence relations are, and the comparison of complexity that
we focus on in this paper is Borel reducibility which essentially says there is a
reasonably definable way of deciding one equivalence given that we can decide
another. It is important in this context that we require the reduction to be definable
in some way such as Borel. If all we required was that there exists an injection from
one quotient space into the other then the only thing the reduction would compare
is the number of equivalence classes, which has very little to do with the complexity
of the relations.
Many important equivalence relations are actually orbit equivalence relations,
meaning the equivalence classes may be realized as the orbits of some reasonably
definable group action. For example Vitali equivalence, r ∼ t ⇔ r − t ∈ Q, is
induced by the orbits of Q acting on R by translation. For a more sophisticated
example, the finitely generated groups may be coded as a Polish space on which the
isomorphism relation for finitely generated groups is induced by the image action of
the group of those automorphisms of the free group on countably many generators
which only move finitely many of the generators (Champetier, [1]).
One class of equivalence relations of particular interest are the hyperfinite relations whose equivalence classes are precisely the orbits of a single Borel automorphism of the space or, equivalently, the orbits of an action of the integers. It has
been known for some time that Borel Zn -actions are still of this type, hence the orbits of a Borel Zn -action are realizable as the orbits of a single Borel automorphism.
But it was not until [2] that Gao and Jackson showed that the orbit equivalence

induced by a Borel action of any countable abelian group is hyperfinite. So in terms
of reasonably definable orbit equivalence, no countable abelian group can do worse
than Z. Improving on this can go in multiple directions. One is that the abelian
property of the group is stronger than necessary, and it has already been shown
by Schneider and Seward in [3] that it is sufficient for the countable group to be
locally nilpotent. In fact it has long been conjectured that any countable amenable
group will only induce such relations, but this currently remains unknown. At
the moment, the best unpublished result communicated to the author is that it is
sufficient for the countable group to be metabelian.
Another direction is to do away with the requirement for the group to be countable. In this case, we would aim to show that the induced orbit equivalence relation
is essentially hyperfinite, meaning that it is Borel reducible to a hyperfinite one. It
cannot be exactly hyperfinite since the equivalence classes are no longer countable,
but for our notion of complexity the reducibility result is enough. For example,
the relation on R in which all points are equivalent to each other is a very simple
relation with only a single class, but it is of course not induced by any Z-action on
R. However, we would say that it is essentially hyperfinite since it would reduce to
any Z-orbit equivalence by way of a constant function. Ding and Gao showed in [4]
that any essentially countable Borel equivalence relation which is Borel reducible
to an orbit equivlance relation induced by a non-archimedean abelian Polish group
must be essentially hyperfinite. As a corollary, this means in particular that locally
compact non-archimedean abelian Polish groups induce only essentially hyperfinite
Borel equivalence relations.
So we arrive at the motivation for this paper. Our desire is to explore the
descriptive complexity of those orbit equivalence relations which are induced by
an action of an abelian standard Borel group which we no longer require to be
countable and also wish to avoid the need to be non-archimedean as that case is
now well-understood. And we have made some progress in this direction.
First, we are able to conclude that a larger subcategory of abelian standard
Borel groups than the locally compact ones will only induce relations which are a
level above the hyperfinite ones, but only just. While the essentially hyperfinite
equivalence relations are those which are Borel reducible to eventual agreement of
sequences of naturals, the hypersmooth equivalence relations are those which are
reducible to eventual agreement of sequences of reals. We will give more basic
definitions later, but note that the hypersmooth are a minimal step above the
hyperfinite in the sense that there are no strictly intermediate equivalence relations
under Borel reduction.
We have the following result.
Theorem 1.1. A Borel action on a standard Borel space of a group which is (Borel)
isomorphic to the sum of a countable abelian group with a countable sum of copies
of R and T induces a Borel orbit equivalence relation which is hypersmooth.
Then, it follows that we can use the known structure theory for Hausdorff locally
compact abelian (i.e., LCA) groups to reduce those relations induced by any Polish
LCA group to the hyperfinite ones, providing a nice extension of Gao and Jackson’s
result for the countable abelian groups (although in the case of free actions our
method does not provide a continuous reduction) and eliminating the need for the
non-archimedean property in the LCA case.

Theorem 1.2. A Borel action of a second countable LCA group on a standard Borel
space induces a Borel orbit equivalence relation which is essentially hyperfinite.
In Section 3 we show that all of the orbit equivalence relations from Theorems
1.1 and 1.2 reduce to ones induced by a Borel action of a countable sum of copies of
R. In Section 4 we show that these orbit equivalence relations which are induced by
a countable sum of copies of R are countable disjoint unions of equivalence relations
which are induced by free Borel actions of countable sums of copies of R and T.
Finally, in Section 5, we show that the relations induced by the free actions of
countable sums of copies of R and T are hypersmooth. Since a countable disjoint
union of hypersmooth equivalence relations is hypersmooth, locally compact Polish
groups induce essentially countable equivalence relations, and essentially countable
equivalence relations which are hypersmooth must be essentially hyperfinite, we
will have proven Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.
2. Preliminaries
2.1. Standard Borel Spaces. A Polish space is a separable, completely metrizable topological space.
The collection of Borel sets of a topological space is the σ-algebra generated by
the open sets. In some settings, the collection of Borel sets without distinguishing
the open sets is more important than any particular topology involved. So rather
than a topology on a space, we will often be interested only in a Borel structure
on the space. We say that a function is a Borel function (or Borel measurable
function) if the preimages of Borel sets are Borel.
The proof of the following theorem is surprisingly nontrivial: (See §15A in [5].)
Theorem 2.1. (Luzin–Suslin) If X and Y are Polish spaces and f : X → Y is a
Borel injection, then for any Borel set A in X, f (A) is Borel in Y .
Thus, one-to-one Borel functions have Borel inverses. So if we suppose there
exists a Borel bijection f from X onto Y , it follows that A is Borel in X iff f (A) is
Borel in Y . And we can say that X and Y are Borel isomorphic.
When working in the generality of Borel structures, we take advantage of the
Borel isomorphism theorem: (Proofs can be found in §15B of [5] or §1.3 of [6].)
Theorem 2.2. Any two uncountable Polish spaces are Borel isomorphic.
By the Borel isomorphism theorem, the Borel structures on uncountable Polish
spaces are all essentially the same. In particular, any two Polish topologies on an
uncountable set must generate the same Borel sets. So a set which is Borel in some
Polish topology must be Borel in all Polish topologies, and so we may talk about
the Borel structure on such a space.
A standard Borel space is a measurable space (X, A) where there exists a Polish
topology on X so that A is the σ-algebra of Borel sets generated by the topology.
The first step in attacking many classification problems is to parametrize the
collection of interesting objects as a standard Borel space so that we can apply the
tools of descriptive set theory. Often each object can be embedded into a Polish
space as a subset. So once we have these embeddings we need to know if we can
build a standard Borel space out of those subsets, and one way to do that is to use
the Effros structure.

MICHAEL R. COTTON

Let F (X) denote the collection of closed subsets of a space X. The Effros Borel
structure on F (X) is the σ-algebra generated by the sets of the form {F ∈ F (X) :
F ∩ U 6= ∅} where U ⊆ X is open. (For the following, see §12C in [5].)
Theorem 2.3. If X is a Polish space, the space F (X) with the Effros structure is
a standard Borel space.
Finally, we need a good tool for showing that a subspace of the Effros space is
Borel or often for just helping us definably choose points in a construction. (See
§12C in [5].)
Theorem 2.4. (Kuratowski–Ryll-Nardzewski) For a Polish space X, there is a
sequence of Borel functions fn : F (X) \ {∅} → X such that {fn (F )} is dense in F
for each F ∈ F (X) \ {∅}.
2.2. Some Classifications of Equivalence Relations. For two equivalence relations E and F on standard Borel spaces X and Y , resp., we say that E is Borel
reducible to F , denoted E ≤B F , if there exists a Borel function f : X → Y such
that x1 E x2 ⇔ f (x1 ) F f (x2 ). Equivalently, E ≤B F if there is an injection with
a Borel lifting from the equivalence classes X/E into the equivalence classes Y /F .
We say E is bireducible to F if both E ≤B F and F ≤B E.
We call an equivalence relation smooth if it is Borel reducible to = on the reals,
or equivalently by the Borel isomorphism theorem, if it is reducible to the identity
relation on X for any uncountable Polish space X. The smooth equivalence relations are also called concretely classifiable since in this case the Borel reduction is
providing a reasonably definable procedure for computing a number, or concrete
invariant, which decides the classification of the object. A useful fact for us is the
following: (See §5.4 in [6].)
Theorem 2.5. Closed equivalence relations are smooth.
We call a Borel equivalence relation a countable equivalence relation if each equivalence class is countable. Similarly, we call an equivalence relation a finite relation
if each equivalence class is finite. And then a countable Borel equivalence relation
E is called hyperfinite if there is an increasing
sequence F0 ⊆ F1 ⊆ F2 ⊆ . . . of finite
S
Borel equivalence relations with E = n Fn , i.e., xEy ⇔ ∃n(xFn y). However, the
term hyperfinite is only used to describe countable equivalence relations. In our
wider context, an equivalence relation is called essentially countable if it is Borel
reducible to a countable Borel equivalence relation, and an equivalence relation
is called essentially hyperfinite if it is reducible to a hyperfinite Borel equivalence
relation.
We call an equivalence relation hypersmooth if there is an increasing
S sequence
F0 ⊆ F1 ⊆ F2 ⊆ . . . of smooth Borel equivalence relations with E = n Fn , i.e.,
xEy ⇔ ∃n(xFn y).
It is useful to be able to show equivalence relations belong to a certain Borel
reducibility class by having benchmark relations to reduce them to, and we have
these for the classes we consider here. Define E0 to be the equivalence relation on NN
y ⇔ ∃n∀m ≥ n (xm = ym ). And define E1 to be the equivalence
x E0 ⇀
defined by ⇀
y ⇔ ∃n∀m ≥ n (xm = ym ). The following fact (See
x E1 ⇀
relation on RN defined by ⇀
[7] and [8]) establishes that E0 and E1 indeed are benchmarks for the essentially
hyperfinite and hypersmooth relations in the same way that =R is a benchmark for
the smooth.

Proposition 2.6. A Borel equivalence relation E is hypersmooth iff E ≤B E1 , and
E is essentially hyperfinite iff E ≤B E0 .
Another basic fact that we will take advantage of is the following:
Lemma 2.7. A countable disjoint union of hypersmooth equivalence relations is
hypersmooth.
S
Proof. Suppose X = n Xn with each Xn Borel and i 6= j ⇒ Xi ∩ Xj = ∅,
and suppose each Fn is a hypersmooth equivalence relation on Xn . Then let each
⇀
⇀
fn : Xn → RN be a borel reduction of Fn to E1 , i.e., xFn y ⇔ fn (x) E1 fn (y).
Letting φ : R × N → R be a Borel isomorphism and defining nx = m ⇔ x ∈ Xm , it
follows
S that x 7→ hφ(hfnx (x)ik , nx )ik∈N is a Borel reduction of the union equivalence

E = n Fn to E1 .
Kechris and Louveau established the following dichotomy between the essentially
hyperfinite and hypersmooth relations.

Theorem 2.8. (Kechris–Louveau, [8]) Let X be a standard Borel space and E a
hypersmooth equivalence relation on X. Then either E is essentially hyperfinite or
E is bireducible to E1 .
Another important property of E1 is that it cannot be reduced to any countable
Borel equivalence relation.
Theorem 2.9. ([8] or §5 of [5]) If F is a countable Borel equivalence relation, then
E1 6≤B F .
Combining Theorems 2.8 and 2.9, we have the following.
Corollary 2.10. If E is both hypersmooth and essentially countable, then E is
essentially hyperfinite.
2.3. Topological Groups and Orbit Equivalence Relations. A topological
group is a group G together with a topology on G such that the group operation
and inverse function are continuous, and a Polish group is a topological group whose
topology is Polish. More generally, a standard Borel group is a group G together
with a standard Borel structure such that the group operations are Borel. So all
Polish groups are standard Borel groups, and any Borel subgroup of a Polish group
is a standard Borel group. However, not all standard Borel groups are Polish groups
since there may not exist a Polish topology which induces the Borel structure while
at the same time making the operations continuous.
By orbit equivalence relation we mean an equivalence relation on a standard
Borel space where the equivalence classes are precisely the orbits of a Borel action
on the space by a standard Borel group, i.e., an orbit equivalence relation E on X
is such that there exists such a group G and a Borel action (g, x) 7→ g · x where
x E y ⇔ ∃g ∈ G s.t. y = g · x . In the case when E is an orbit equivalence relation
on X given by a Borel action of some group G, we will often summarize the situation
X
by writing E instead as EG
.
In the case where the acting group is Polish, Becker and Kechris provide the
following powerful theorem.
Theorem 2.11. (Becker–Kechris, [9]) Given a Borel action of a Polish group G
on a standard Borel space X, there exists a Polish topology on X so that the action
is continuous.

Corollary 2.12. Given a Borel action of a Polish group G on a standard Borel
space X, each stabilizer Gx = {g ∈ G : g · x = x} is a closed subgroup of G.
While Corollary 2.12 follows easily from Theorem 2.11, it was originally proven
directly by Miller in [10].
They also show that the map from a point to its stabilizer is a Borel map into
the Effros space of the acting group, and this fact will be important for some of our
computations.
Theorem 2.13. (Becker–Kechris, [9]) Given a Borel action of a Polish group G
on a standard Borel space X, the map x 7→ Gx from X into F (G) is Borel if and
X
only if EG
is Borel.
The following definitions and theorems are useful. For proofs of these, we refer
the reader to [11] or §5.4 of [6].
We call an equivalence relation E on a standard Borel space X idealistic if there
is an assignment to each E-equivalence class C of a nontrivial σ-ideal IC on C such
that for every Borel set A ⊆ X 2 the set AI where x ∈ AI ⇔ {y ∈ [x] : (x, y) ∈
A} ∈ I[x] is Borel. By a Borel selector for E, we mean a Borel function s : X → X
such that for each x, y ∈ X, s(x)Ex and xEy ⇒ s(x) = s(y)
Theorem 2.14. (Kechris, [11]) Let E be an equivalence relation on a standard
Borel space X. Then E has a Borel selector iff E is smooth and idealistic.
In the case of of an orbit equivalence relation induced by an action of a Polish
group, we may let S ∈ IC ⇔ {g ∈ G : g · x ∈ S} is meager in G, and we get the
following.
Lemma 2.15. Let G be a Polish group acting in a Borel manner on a Polish space
X
X. Then EG
is idealistic.
In our constructions for Section 5, we will begin with the following “countable
sections” constructed by Kechris.
Theorem 2.16. (Kechris, [11]) Suppose G is a locally compact polish group acting
continuously on a Polish space X. Then there is a Borel set Y ⊆ X which contains
X
at least one and at most countably many points of each G-orbit (i.e., each EG
equivalence class). Moreover, given any compact symmetric neighborhood K of the
identity in G, we may construct Y so that ∀y ∈ Y , (K · y) ∩ Y = {y}. (Here, we
will say that Y is K-discrete).
Applying the Luzin–Novikov uniformization theorem to P ⊂ X × Y defined by
X
X
X
(x, y) ∈ P ⇔ xEG
y, we get a Borel function which reduces EG
to EG
↾ Y and
so we have the following corollary which, in light of Corollary 2.10, tells us that
whenever an orbit equivalence relation which is induced by an action of a locally
compact Polish group is hypersmooth then it is essentially hyperfinite.
Corollary 2.17. (Kechris, [11]) If G is a locally compact Polish group acting in
a Borel manner on a standard Borel space X, then the induced orbit equivalence
X
is essentially countable.

3.1. Reducing the LCA-actions to Rn × Z<ω -actions. We make use of the
Principal Structure Theorem for locally compact abelian groups. Following the
convention of [12], we say LCA group to mean locally compact Hausdorff abelian
topological group. The following version1 of the structure theorem for LCA groups
is carefully proven in [13].
Theorem 3.1. (Principal Structure Theorem) Every LCA group is topologically
isomorphic to Rn × H for some non-negative integer n and where H is some Hausdorff abelian group which has a compact open (in H) subgroup K.
Now, we show that in our context of Borel reduction of orbit equivalence relations, the compact open subgroup may be ‘modded out’ and ignored.

Lemma 3.2. Suppose EG
is induced by a Borel action of a Polish group G on
a standard Borel space X, and suppose G has a normal subgroup N such that the
X
subequivalence relation EN
(induced by the restriction of the action to N × X) is
X
Y
smooth. Then EG ≤B EG/N for some Borel Y ⊆ X.
X
Proof. Since EN
is smooth, it follows from Theorem 2.14 & Lemma 2.15 that it
has a Borel selector (which also serves as the reduction function), i.e., we have a
X
X
Borel function s : X → X such that for each x, y ∈ X, s(x)EN
x and xEN
y ⇒
s(x) = s(y). Letting Y be the image of the selector s, we define the new action ˆ·
of G/N on Y by gN ˆ· x = s(g · x). Note that since each s(g · x) ∈ N g · x = gN · x,
we have that s(g · s(h · x)) ∈ gN · s(h · x) ⊂ gN · (hN · x) = ghN · x, and hence
each s(g · s(h · x)) = s(gh · x). Thus gN ˆ· (hN ˆ· x) = ghN ˆ· x, and ˆ· is indeed an
action.

In the case of Polish LCA groups, we may now simplify the problem of bounding
their complexity under Borel reduction.
X
Theorem 3.3. Suppose EG
is induced by a Borel action of a Polish (i.e., second
X
countable) LCA group G on a standard Borel space X. Then EG
is Borel reducible
to an equivalence relation which is induced by a Borel action of Rn × Z<ω , for some
non-negative integer n, on a Borel subset Y ⊆ X.

Proof. By Theorem 3.1, G ∼
= Rn × H where H has a compact open subgroup K.
Then since K is compact and therefore acts smoothly, we may apply Lemma 3.2
X
to reduce EG
to an action of
Rn × H ∼ n
= R × H/K
{0}n × K
on a Borel Y ⊂ X where H/K must be a countable abelian group since H is
second countable and K is open. Finally since every countable abelian group is
a homomorphic image of Z<ω , we may let φ : Rn × Z<ω → Rn × H/K be the
appropriate quotient map, and then where a : (Rn × H/K) × Y → Y is the Borel
action given by Lemma 3.2, we let Rn × Z<ω act on Y by â(g, x) = a(φ(g), x). Then
the identity function on Y is a Borel reduction from ERYn ×H/K to ERYn ×Z<ω .

1As in [12], the Principal Structure Theorem for LCA groups is often given as the seemingly
weaker: “Every LCA group has an open subgroup topologically isomorphic to Rn × K, for some
compact group K and non-negative integer n.” However, this can be shown to be equivalent to
the version used here.

4. Non-free actions of R<ω
In this section, we will consider the stabilizers under an R<ω action and produce
Borel functions which provide bases for the stabilizers as well as for an algebraic
complement of their R-spans. We may then split the space into countably many
disjoint invariant pieces according to the isomorphism types of the quotients of R<ω

by these stabilizers. Finally, we will use the basis functions to produce a free action
of that quotient on each of these countably many pieces which produces the same
orbits as the original action.

. We will abuse

and when we refer to a closed subgroup of any R we mean with respect to the
usual topology. However, when we refer to a closed subgroup of R<ω we mean with
respect to the topology where a set A ⊂ R<ω is closed iff each A ∩ Rn is closed in
Rn . Equivalently, the topology on R<ω is the subspace topology inherited from the
“box” topology on the product Rω where all products of open sets form a basis for
the topology. This is also the topology on R<ω when viewed as the direct limit of
the Rn ’s. The structure of the closed subgroups and Hausdorff quotients of R<ω
(and in fact any of the entire class of groups considered in this paper) under this
topology are explored thoroughly in [14]. But we will highlight a few important
points:
Proposition 4.1. (Brown–Higgins–Morris, [14])
(i) Every finite-dimensional subspace of R<ω has the standard topology.
(ii) A subset of R<ω is open (closed) iff it meets each finite-dimensional subspace F in an open (closed) subset of F .
(iii) R<ω is a topological vector space. (i.e., the scalar multiplication is continuous)
(iv) Any Hausdorff topological vector space of algebraic dimension ℵ0 over R
and having property (ii) is isomorphic, as a topological vector space, to
R<ω .

(v) Every

( β Z) where α, β are each finite or ω, and every Hausdorff quotient of
L
L
R<ω is topologically isomorphic to some ( β T) ⊕ ( γ R) where β, γ are
each finite or ω.
Property (v) of Proposition 4.1 is the most important for our purposes, and in
particular, it was proven by showing the following:
Proposition 4.2. (Brown–Higgins–Morris) If G is a closed subgroup of R<ω , then
there is an R-basis for R<ω of the form

The reason this is useful here is that the potential stabilizers of our Borel R<ω
action are precisely these closed subgroups of R<ω , and points belonging to the
same orbit must have the same stabilizer. To see this note that, because R<ω is
abelian, xEy implies the stabilizers Gx = Gy . And each Rn is a Polish group acting
in a Borel manner on X (by the restriction of R<ω ’s action), so by Corollary 2.12
each Gx ∩ Rn is a closed subgroup of Rn . We will show that, given a point x, there
is an invariant Borel way to construct the basis
4.2 for Gx and then

this will allow us to define a free action of ( β T) ⊕ ( γ R) on [x]E .

4.2. Constructing the Bases for the Stabilizers. Let Gnx denote the stabilizer
of x under the restriction of the action to the Rn subspace, and note that each
g ∈ Gnx : ∀q ∈ Q(q ⇀
g ∈ Gnx )}, and note that this
Gnx = Gx ∩ Rn . Also, let Uxn = {⇀

contained in the subgroup Gx , and Ux = n=1 Uxn is the closed subgroup of R<ω
which is also the largest vector subspace of R<ω contained in Gx . We will now
show that we can construct the bases of Proposition 4.2 for Gx effectively from x.
First we need to check that we have the following:
Lemma 4.3. (S. Gao – S. Jackson, personal communication) For each n the map
x 7→ Uxn from X to F (Rn ) is Borel.
Proof. By the definition of the Effros structure on F (Rn ), it suffices to show that
for each open O ⊂ Rn the set {x : Uxn ∩ O 6= ∅} is Borel. Let {Bk }∞
k=1 be an
enumeration of the basis for Rn consisting of the products of bounded open intervals
with rational endpoints, let A ⊂ N be the set of all k ∈ N such that B¯k ⊂ O, fix the

For the converse, let {qi }i=1 be an enumeration of the rationals with q1 = 1.
And suppose we have Bk ⊂ B¯k ⊂ O such that

also for each qi we have ρ(qi ⇀

g ∈ Uxn .
ρ(qi g , Gx ) = 0 so ∀q ∈ Q(q g ∈ Gnx ) and ⇀
Since by Theorem 2.13 we already know x 7→ Gnx is Borel, the claim shows that
x 7→ Uxn is also Borel.


Now we begin by constructing from x a basis for the vector subspace part of Gx .
Lemma 4.4. Given a Borel action of R<ω on a standard Borel space S
X, there are

invariant Borel maps x 7→ α(x) ∈ ω + 1 and x 7→ {u

such that {ui (x) : i ∈ α(x)} is a basis for Ux .
Proof. We prove the result by defining a procedure for the construction of such
a basis. For each n ∈ N, let {fkn : F (Rn ) \ ∅ → Rn | k ∈ N} be the sequence of

selection functions given by Theorem 2.4. Also note that, given a finite sequence
{y⇀i ∈ Rn : i ≤ k}, then

⇀

so h ∈ spanR ({y⇀i }i≤k ) and h 6∈ spanR ({y⇀i }i≤k ) are Borel statements.
Now, we use the selection functions to find new R-linearly independent vectors
to add to the basis.
For n = 1,
⇀

⇀

• If ∃k ∈ N[fk1 (Ux1 ) 6= 0 ], let k0 ∈ N be least such that fk10 (Ux1 ) 6= 0 , let
u⇀0 (x) = fk10 (Ux1 ), and let α1 (x) = 1.
• Otherwise, let α1 (x) = 0. Then the n = 1 step halts and we move on to
n = 2.
⇀
For n = m + 1, let {u
i (x) : i ∈ αm (x)} be the sequence constructed from the
previous m dimensions. Then,
⇀
• If ∀k ∈ N [fkm+1 (Uxm+1 ) ∈ spanR {u
i (x) : i ∈ αm (x)}], then the n = m + 1
step halts and we move on to n = m + 2.
⇀
• If ∃k ∈ N [fkm+1 (Uxm+1 ) 6∈ spanR {u
i (x) : i ∈ αm (x)}], then we extend the
sequence as follows:
⇀
(Uxm+1 ) 6∈ spanR {u
– Let k1 be least such that fkm+1
i (x) : i ∈ αm (x)},

m+1
⇀
m+1
and let u αm (x)+1 (x) = fk1 (Ux ).
⇀
– If ∃k ∈ N [fkm+1 (Uxm+1 ) 6∈ spanR {u

m+1
⇀
be least such that fkj+1 (Ux ) 6∈ spanR {u
i (x) : i ∈ αm (x) + j}, and
m+1
⇀
m+1
let u αm (x)+j+1 (x) = fkj+1 (Ux ).
u αm (x)+l (x) is constructed so that ∀k ∈ N [fkm+1 (Uxm+1 ) ∈
– Once ⇀
⇀
spanR {u
i (x) : i ∈ αm (x) + l}], let αm+1 (x) = αm (x) + l. Then the
n = m + 1 step halts and we move on to n = m + 2.

Finally, let α(x) = sup{αn (x) : n ∈ N}.
Since, by Theorem 2.13 each x 7→ Gnx is Borel, and by Lemma 4.3 each x 7→ Uxn
⇀
is Borel, this construction provides a Borel map x 7→ {u
i (x) : i ∈ α(x)} where
⇀
{ui (x) : i ∈ α(x)} is selected to be a basis for Ux as desired. To see this, suppose for
⇀
⇀
⇀
contradiction that h ∈ Ux but h 6∈ spanR {u
i (x) : i ∈ α(x)}. Then for some m ∈ N
⇀
⇀
⇀
⇀
m
we would have h ∈ Ux but h 6∈ spanR {ui (x) : i ∈ αm (x)}. Since spanR {u
i (x) :
m
i ∈ αm (x)} is closed in R , it follows that there would exits an open neighborhood
⇀
⇀
h ∈ O ⊂ Rm which is disjoint from spanR {u
i (x) : i ∈ αm (x)}. But if that were the
m

case, O must contain some fk (Ux ) 6∈ spanR {u
i (x) : i ∈ αm (x)} and the mth stage
of the construction would not have halted.

Next, we will construct a Z-basis for the discrete part of Gx so that when
combined with the basis for the vector subspace part of Gx forms an R-basis for
spanR (Gx ).
Lemma 4.5. Given a Borel action of R<ω on a standard Borel space S
X, there are
invariant Borel maps x 7→ β(x) ∈ ω + 1 and x 7→ {v⇀i (x) : i ∈ β(x)} ∈ j≤ω (R<ω )j

such that {v⇀i (x) : i ∈ β(x)} is linearly independent over R and
M
Z v⇀i (x).
Gx = Ux ⊕
i∈β(x)

⇀
Proof. Let the basis {u
i (x) : i ∈ α(x)} for Ux be constructed as in Lemma 4.4.
First, we construct a basis for a complementary subspace Vx of Ux in R<ω .
Given any finite sequence {y⇀i ∈ R<ω : i ≤ k},
⇀

h ∈ spanR (Ux ∪ {y⇀j }j≤k )
⇀
⇀
⇀
⇔ h ∈ spanR {u
i (x) : i ∈ α(x)} + spanR {yj : j ≤ k}
⇀

⇀
⇀
⇔ ∃n [ h ∈ spanR {u
i (x) : i ∈ αn (x)} + spanR {yj : j ≤ k}]

⇀

⇔ ∃n [d( h , spanQ {u

so h ∈ span(Ux ∪ {y⇀j }j≤k ) and h 6∈ span(Ux , {y⇀j }j≤k ) are Borel statements. Now,
ek ∈ R<ω for k ∈ N be the usual coordinate vector where (⇀
ek )k = 1 and
let each ⇀
⇀
( ek )j = 0 for all j 6= k. We construct a subset Ax ⊂ N inductively as follows:
ek ∈ spanR (Ux )] let Ax = ∅.
• If ∀k ∈ N [⇀
ek 6∈ spanR (Ux )], then
• If ∃k ∈ N [⇀
– let k0 be the least such k, and
ek 6∈ spanR (Ux ∪ {⇀
e kj : j ≤ i})], let ki+1 be the least such
– if ∃k > ki [⇀

ek ∈ spanR (Ux ∪ {⇀
e kj : j ≤ i})], then the construction

halts and we let Ax be the set of kj for j ≤ i.
– if the construction does not halt then we let Ax = {ki : i ∈ N}.

e k : k ∈ Ax }. That Ux ∩ Vx = {⇀
We let Vx = spanR {⇀

element of spanR (Ux ∪ {⇀
Now we let Dx = Gx ∩ Vx and let each Dxn = Dx ∩ Rn . Then each Dxn =
n
e k : k ∈ Ax & k ≤ n}. Hence each Dxn is a closed subgroup of Rn ,
Gx ∩ spanR {⇀
and Dx is a closed subgroup of R<ω in the topology discussed at the beginning of
Section 4.1. Also, each Dxn must be discrete in Rn . To see this, note that Dxn ⊂ Gnx
cannot contain any whole line passing through ⇀
0 since then that line would be
contained in Ux . Since every non-discrete closed subgroup of Rn must contain a
whole line through the origin (See Ch.VII, §1, Proposition 3 in [15]), this means Dxn
must be discrete. But if Dxn is closed discrete then every one of its subsets is closed.
Hence every subset F ⊂ Dx is such that each F ∩ Rn is closed in Rn . So all subsets
of Dx are closed in R<ω , and it follows that Dx is a discrete subgroup of R<ω . By
Proposition 4 of [14] and its proof, it follows that Dx is topologically isomorphic to
either Z<ω or Zn for some n and has a Z-basis which is linearly independent over R.
Moreover, they show that the basis may be constructed inductively, i.e., given a Zbasis for Dxn there exists a Z-basis for Dxn+1 which contains the Dxn basis. Also they
get for free that the Z-basis is linearly independent over R because any subset of an
Rn which is linearly independent over Z must also be linearly independent over R.
(It follows
from Ch.VII, §1, Proposition 1 of [15] that if spanZ {a⇀i : i P

and i≤p ri a⇀i = 0 then there must be some rational combination i≤p qi a⇀i = 0 .

But then by multiplying by a common denominator this would contradict the Zindependence.) Thus, it suffices now to provide a Borel procedure for selecting the
extensions of the bases for the Dxn ’s, which we know to exist, as we induct up the
dimension.
To do this we will need to know that, for each n, the map x 7→ Dxn from X to
F (Rn ) is Borel. So for each open O ⊂ Rn we want to check that Dxn ∩ O 6= ∅ is a
n
Borel statement. Let {Bk }∞
k=1 be an enumeration of the basis for R consisting of
the products of bounded open intervals with rational endpoints, and let NO ⊂ N be
the set of all k ∈ N such that B¯k ⊂ O. Also, let Anx = {k ∈ N : k ∈ Ax & k ≤ n}.
We claim that

For the forward direction, if g ∈ Dxn ∩ O = Gnx ∩ (Vx ∩ Rn ) ∩ O we may choose any
g ∈ Bk ⊂ B¯k ⊂ O. Then since spanQ {⇀
e i : i ∈ Anx } is dense

e in spanQ {⇀

is within some ε neighborhood of g that is contained in Bk and where ε < 1/m.
For the converse, note that the statement says we have a Bk ⊂ B¯k ⊂ O such
e i : i ∈ Anx }, Gnx ) = 0. Hence we may choose a sequence
that d(Bk ∩ spanQ {⇀

zero whenever i 6∈ Ax .
Finally, we may define a procedure for constructing the desired basis. Again let
each {fkn : F (Rn ) \ ∅ → Rn | k ∈ N} be the sequence of selection functions given by
Theorem 2.4. Note that since each Dxn is discrete and {fkn (Dxn ) : k ∈ N} is dense
in Dxn , we have that Dxn = {fkn (Dxn ) : k ∈ N}. So, to say that a finite sequence
{y⇀i ∈ Dxn : i ≤ m} is a Z-basis for Dxn is equivalent to

and hence is a Borel statement. Now, for each n, j ∈ N, let φnj : N → {fkn (Dxn ) :
k ∈ N}j be an enumeration of the j-tuples of the fkn (Dxn )’s. We select the basis as
follows:
For n = 1,
⇀

• If ∃k ∈ N[fk1 (Dx1 ) 6= 0 ], let k0 be least such that {fk10 (Dx1 )} is a Z-basis for
Dx1 and let v⇀0 (x) = fk10 (Dx1 ) and β1 (x) = 1.
• If ∀k ∈ N[fk1 (Dx1 ) = ⇀
0 ], let β1 (x) = 0. Then the n = 1 step halts and we
move on to n = 2.
⇀
(Note that, since our new basis vectors are independent from the u
i (x)’s and also
R-linearly independent, the most new vectors that may be added at any nth stage
is n − αn (x) − βn−1 (x).)
For n = m + 1, let {v⇀i (x) : i ∈ βm (x)} be the sequence constructed from the
previous m dimensions. Then,

• If {v⇀i (x) : i ∈ βm (x)} is a Z-basis for Dxm+1 , let βm+1 (x) = βm (x). Then
the n = m + 1 step halts and we move on to n = m + 2.

14

MICHAEL R. COTTON

• If {v⇀i (x) : i ∈ βm (x)} is not a Z-basis for Dxm+1 , let j be the unique natural
≤ n − αm+1 (x) − βm (x) such that ∃l ∈ N [{v⇀i (x) : i ∈ βm (x)} ∪ φnj (l) is a
Z-basis for Dxm+1 ], let l0 be the least such l, let βm+1 (x) = βm (x) + j, and
let {v⇀i (x) : i ∈ βm+1 (x)} = {v⇀i (x) : i ∈ βm (x)}⌢ {(φnj (l0 ))i : i ≤ j}.
Finally, let β(x) = sup{βn (x) : n ∈ N}.
Since we have shown that each x 7→ Dxn is Borel, and that the necessary extensions of the Z-basis from Dxn to Dxn+1 exist, this construction provides a Borel map
x 7→ {v⇀i (x) : i ∈ β(x)} where {v⇀i (x) : i ∈ β(x)} is a Z-basis (therefore also linearly

5. Free actions of countable sums of R and T
5.1. Marker Sets for Locally Compact Group Actions. We have seen from
Theorem 2.16 that we can construct a Borel set which hits every orbit of an acting
locally compact Polish group, and we can do so in a way that guarantees the points
in the set which belong to the same orbit are “spread out” with respect to the
acting group. However, this is not quite enough to give us the control we desire
when trying to make local moves in our constructions. We want to be able to
describe what goes on around a point using the nearest points of the spread out
subset for reference. But we do not yet have a spread out subset for which we can
guarantee one does not have to look too far in order to find a reference point. So
now our goal is to show that we can extend Kechris’ countable K-discrete sections
into K-discrete sections with the added property that any point in the orbit is
K-close to a point in the section.
While adding points to the section, we may along the way accidentally add
points that are too close together. So then we want to be able to choose which
points remain in the set and which ones to throw out in order to maintain the
section’s K-discreteness. To do this, we will make use of the following lemma from
[16].
Lemma 5.1. Let F be a locally finite symmetric reflexive Borel relation on X.
Then there exists a Borel maximal F -discrete subset of X.
Here, locally finite means that ∀x ∈ X, F (x) = {y ∈ X : yF x} is finite, and we
say that Y ⊆ X is maximal F-discrete if we have both ∀x, y ∈ Y (x 6= y =⇒ ¬xF y)
and ∀x ∈ X∃y ∈ Y (xF y).
When applying Lemma 5.1 in our argument, the relation F that we are interested in is the K-relation, xF y ⇔ y ∈ K · x, where K is a compact symmetric
neighborhood of the identity in the acting group. And to apply Lemma 5.1, we
need to make sure each time that the K-relation is locally finite on its domain.
The following lemma will make this much easier to manage.
Lemma 5.2. Suppose we have an action of a Hausdorff group G on a set X. Let
K be a symmetric neighborhood of the identity in G, let Y ⊆ X be K-discrete (i.e.,
if x, y ∈ Y are distinct, then y 6∈ K · x), and let C ⊆ G be compact. Then for any
x ∈ X, the set Y ∩ (C · x) is finite.
Proof. Suppose for contradiction that Y ∩ (C · x) is infinite. Then there exists
an infinite subset A ⊆ C where A · x ⊆ Y and if g, h ∈ A are distinct then
g · x 6= h · x. But then since A ⊆ C is infinite and C is compact, A must cluster
b be a symmetric neighborhood of the identity such
at some ĉ ∈ C. Letting K
2
b
that K ⊆ K, and noting that the group is Hausdorff, it follows that we can
b ĉ. But then a1 ∈ K
b 2 a2 ⊆ Ka2 . So we would have
choose distinct a1 , a2 ∈ A ∩ K
a1 · x ∈ K · (a2 · x) where a1 · x and a2 · x are distinct members of Y , contradicting
Y ’s K-discreteness.

Now, to extend Kechris’ K-discrete sections into maximal ones, we will make
a somewhat similar argument to one given by Slutsky in [17]. However, Slutsky’s
definition of K-lacunary is what we would call K 2 -discrete, and the alternative
proof provided here seems to be of value.

Theorem 5.3. Let G be a locally compact polish group acting in a Borel manner
on a standard Borel space X, and let K be a compact symmetric neighborhood of
the identity in G. Then there is a Borel set M ⊆ X such that
(i) if x, y ∈ M are distinct, then y 6∈ K · x,
(ii) K · M = X.
Proof. Let (g, x) 7→ g · x be the Borel G-action on X. By Theorem 2.11, there is a
Polish topology on X for which the action is continuous. So for the duration of the
proof we may assume without loss of generality that X has a fixed Polish topology
and that the action of G on X is continuous.
Then by Theorem 2.16 we may let Y be a Borel subset of X so that if x, y ∈ Y
are distinct then y 6∈ K · x, and G · Y = X. (i.e., Y is K-discrete and Y meets every
orbit.)
Now, let {dn : n ∈ N} be a countable dense subset of G, let Y0 = Y , and let
Ye0 = Y0 ∪ ((d0 · Y ) \ (K · Y0 )). In other words, we get Ye0 by adding on all the
points of d0 · Y which are not already within K of a point of Y0 . Now, Ye0 may
not be K-discrete anymore since, while none of the new points are within K of
the old points, some of the new points may be within K of each other. However,
if we consider the relation F on Ye0 where xF y ⇔ y ∈ K · x, it follows that F
is symmetric and reflexive since K is symmetric and contains the identity. And it
follows from Lemma 5.2 that F is locally finite since there can be only finitely many
y ∈ Y ∩ (d−1
0 K · x) for which it’s possible that we’d have d0 · y ∈ K · x. Thus, we
may apply Lemma 5.1 and let Y1 be a Borel, maximal F -discrete (hence maximal
K-discrete) subset of Ye0 . We then iterate this construction letting each Yn+1 be a
maximal K-discrete subset
of Yen = Yn ∪ ((dn · Y ) \ (K · Yn )).
S
Finally, let M = n Yn . If x, y ∈ M are distinct, then since the Yn ’s are
increasing there is an n large enough so that x, y ∈ Yn and hence y 6∈ K · x. So M
is K-discrete and has property (i).
Now we suppose for contradiction that there exists an x ∈ X such that M ∩ (K ·
x) = ∅ (i.e., x 6∈ K · M ). By the K-discreteness of M and the compactness of K 2 ,
Lemma 5.2 tells us that M ∩ (K 2 · x) must be finite, and so the set
[
(K · y)
A=
y∈M∩(K 2 ·x)

is closed in X and does not contain x. Thus X \ A is open and contains x.
And then for any open symmetric neighborhood of the identity O ⊆ K such that
O · x ⊆ X \ A, we have that (O · x) ∩ (K · M ) = ∅. But this could not happen
since the dn ’s are dense and O is open. Since x ∈ G · y0 for some y0 ∈ Y , we let
g ∈ G be such that x = g · y0 , and note that Og is a nonempty open subset of G.
So since the dn ’s are dense it follows that ∃ l ∈ N such that dl ∈ Og. But then
dl · y0 ∈ Og · y0 = O · x. Hence by the l th stage of the construction there would have
been a dl ·y0 ∈ dl ·Y which belonged to O ·x that would have been added to Yel . And
so there must be some y ∈ Yl+1 ⊆ M which is within K of that dl · y0 and hence
within K of O · x, a contradiction. Thus every x ∈ X is such that (K · x) ∩ M 6= ∅,
and M has property (ii).

is well-defined, and for any x, y, z ∈ X, and ρX (x, z) ≤ ρX (x, y) + ρX (y, z).
Proof. By our Theorem 2.11 from Becker and Kechris, we may fix a Polish topology
on X for which the action of Gn is continuous. Then A = {g ∈ Gn : g · x = y} is
closed in Gn and attains its minimum seminorm since we may let d be large enough
⇀
⇀
so that the closed ball B̄ρ ( 0 , d) in Rn is such that (Tn × B̄( 0 , d)) ∩ A 6= ∅, and
⇀
then the seminorm is a continuous function on the compact set A ∩ (Tn × B̄ρ ( 0 , d)).
And for any g, h ∈ Gn such that g · x = y and h · y = z, it follows that (g + h) · x = z
and of course ||g + h|| ≤ ||g|| + ||h||. Hence min{||u|| : u · x = z} ≤ min{||g|| : g · x =
y} + min{||h|| : h · y = z}.

We will omit the subscript X from ρX whenever there’s little chance of confusion.
And we also define, for A, B ⊆ X and x ∈ X, ρ(x, A) = inf{ρ(x, y) : y ∈ A} and
ρ(A, B) = inf{ρ(x, y) : x ∈ A & y ∈ B}.
The backbone of our constructions is the existence of the following sets.
Lemma 5.5. Let Tn × Rn act in a Borel manner on a standard Borel space X,
and let d be a positive real number. Then there is a Borel set M ⊆ X such that
(i) if x, y ∈ M are distinct, then ρ(x, y) > d,
(ii) for any x ∈ X, ρ(x, M ) ≤ d.
Proof. Tn × [−d, d]n is a compact symmetric neighborhood of the identity. So by
Theorem 5.3 there is a Borel set M ⊆ X such that
• if x, y ∈ M are distinct, then y 6∈ (Tn × [−d, d]n ) · x,
• (Tn × [−d, d]n ) · M = X.
Now, y 6∈ Tn × [−d, d]n · x implies that no g with ||g|| ≤ d can be such that
g · x = y. Hence ρ(x, y) = min{||g|| : g · x = y} > d, and M has property (i).
And Tn × [−d, d]n · M = X says that for any x there is a g ∈ Tn × [−d, d]n , hence
||g|| ≤ d, where g · x ∈ M . So then ρ(x, M ) ≤ d and M has property (ii).

We refer to such a set M as a marker set, and we may say d-marker set when
we want to specify the distance.
5.3. Tn -invariant Rectangular Marker Regions. Again we fix an n ∈ N, a
standard Borel space X, and a Borel action of G = Tn ⊕ Rn on X. However, we
now assume that G = Tn ⊕ Rn acts freely on X. A subset Y ⊆ X will be called
Tn -invariant if x ∈ Y ⇒ (Tn × {0}n ) · x ⊆ Y .
By marker regions we will simply mean the R-equivalence classes for some subeX
quivalence relation R of EG
. Since the action of Tn ⊕ Rn on X is free, we may also
X
treat each EG -equivalence class as an affine copy of Tn ⊕ Rn using the corresponX
dence [x] = (Tn ⊕ Rn ) · x. Then, for any subequivalence R of EG

[x] ∈ EG
, and any y ∈ [x], there is a unique J ⊂ Tn ⊕ Rn so that [y]R = J · x. And
given any another x′ , y ′ ∈ [x] there is a unique J ′ so that [y ′ ]R = J ′ · x′ where J
and J ′ have identical geometric structures modulo a shift. We then call a marker
region a Tn -invariant half-open n-dimensional
rectangle if the corresponding J’s in
Q
Tn ⊕ Rn are of the form Tn × n [an , bn ) where each bn − an > 0. (So, we are
assuming the rectangles have faces perpendicular to the coordinate axes.) When
we say edge lengths of such a “rectangle”, we mean the set of lengths of the intervals [an , bn ) corresponding to any one of the J’s. Also, we say that a region is a
Tn -invariant half-open n-dimensional rectangular polyhedron if it is a finite union
of Tn -invariant half-open n-dimensional rectangles. Then for each i ≤ n we define
an i-face of such a “polyhedron” P to be a maximal (n − 1)-dimensional subset F

In this example of a half-open rectangular polyhedron, F1 and F2 are parts of the same
face. Similarly, F3 and F4 are parts of a single face.

Now we will show that we may construct marker regions which are not only
rectangular but are nearly square.
Theorem 5.6. Let d ≥ ε > 0. Then there is a Borel subequivalence relation Rd

such that each Rd -marker region is a Tn -invariant half-open n-dimensional

Proof of Claim 1. We let M be a basic Borel ∆1 -marker set given by Lemma
5.5, and we let K = Tn × [−∆2 , ∆2 ]n .
Considering the relation F on M where xF y ⇔ y ∈ K · x, it follows that F
is symmetric and reflexive since K is symmetric and contains the identity. And
it follows from Lemma 5.2 that F is locally finite since M is (Tn × [−∆1 , ∆1 ]n )discrete and K is compact. Thus, we may apply Lemma 5.1 and let A0 be a Borel
maximal F -discrete (hence maximal K-discrete) subset of M . We then iterate this
construction letting A1 be a maximal K-discrete subset of M \ A0 , letting A2 be a
maximal K-discrete subset of M \ (A0 ∪ A1 ), letting A3 be a maximal K-discrete
subset of M \ (A0 ∪ A1 ∪ A2 ), and so on.
This defines a partition A0 , A1 , . . . , Ak of M into disjoint Borel subsets where
for any i and x 6= y ∈ Ai , ρ(x, y) > ∆2 . (The choice of maximal K-discrete subsets
guarantees that k is finite.)
Now let J = Tn × [−∆1 , ∆1 )n , and for each x ∈ M let Rx = J · x, so that Rx is
the Tn -invariant half-open cubic region with “center” Tn · x and edge lengths 2∆1 .
And we consider the relation
xRM y ⇔ ∀z ∈ M (x ∈ Rz ↔ y ∈ Rz ).
Then by the definition of the pseudometric ρ and the marker properties of M , the
RM regions are already Tn -invariant half-open n-dimensional rectangular polyhedra
with faces perpendicular to the coordinate axes. But we need to modify these
regions so that perpendicular distance between parallel faces is at least D. To do
this, we define a collection {Rx′ : x ∈ M } of adjusted rectangles by inductively
defining each {Rx′ : x ∈ Ai }.
S
For x ∈ A0 let Rx′ = Rx . Then assuming that, for each x, y ∈ j<i Aj , we have

(i) Rx ⊆ Rx′ ,
(ii) the corresponding faces of Rx and Rx′ have perpendicular distance no more
1
∆1 , and
than 10
(ii) for each face F1 of Rx′ and any parallel face F2 of Ry′ with ρ(x, y) ≤ 3∆1 ,
the perpendicular distance between F1 and F2 is at least D,

we suppose x ∈ Ai Sand let Ry′ 1 , . . . , Ry′ m enumerate the surrounding rectangles
where y1 , . . . , ym ∈ j<i Aj and ρ(x, yl ) ≤ 3∆1 for each 1 ≤ l ≤ m. Note that
Lemma 5.2 can be used again to verify m must be finite, but in fact a volume
argument would show that m is bounded by 8n .
So then for each face of Rx there are at most 2 · 8n = 23n+1 many faces of
1
Ry′ 1 , . . . , Ry′ m parallel to it, and so if 10
∆1 > 23n+1 (2D) then each face can be
shifted away from the center x so that the new faces satisfy (ii) and (iii). To define
Rx′ for each x ∈ Ai we simply shift each
S of Rx ’s 2n faces away from the center in
this way so that (i) will also hold for j<i+1 Aj . Noting that for any x, y ∈ Ai , we
have ρ(x, y) > ∆2 ≫ ∆1 , we see that the constructions of any pair Rx′ and Ry′ at the
ith stage do not affect each other. And it follows that the collection {Rx′ : x ∈ M }
satisfies properties (i)-(iii) for all x, y ∈ M and hence if we let
xR0 y ⇔ ∀z ∈ M (x ∈ Rz′ ↔ y ∈ Rz′ )
then R0 is as desired.
Proof of Claim 2. The proof of this claim requires no significant change from
the argument in the Zn case from [2], but we provide it here anyway. To divide an
R0 region into the desired RD rectangles, we simply “cut up” each region by the

linear expansions of its faces. For each R0 region P , note that the faces of P are
Borel subsets of P which are definable from P .
Let F1 , . . . , Fk be all the faces of P , and then for each 1 ≤ j ≤ k, we let the
face Fj partition P into at most two parts as follows. Say Fj is an i-face. Then we

Finally define a subequivalence relation RP on P by
xRP y ⇔ ∀1 ≤ j ≤ k ( x ∈ Fj+ ↔ y ∈ Fj+ ).
Then the equivalence classes of RP are Tn -invariant half-open rectangles whose
faces are parts of linear expansions of the faces of P . These rectangles have edge
lengths greater than D because the parallel faces of P have perpendicular distances
greater than D.

5.4. Orthogonal Marker Regions for Free Actions of T<ω ⊕ R<ω . Where E
is the orbit equivalence relation induced by an action of T<ω ⊕ R<ω we will use
En to denote the subequivalence relation induced by the action of the subgroup
Tn ⊕ Rn . (We will not return to using the usual meaning of E1 until the end of the
proof of Theorem 5.10.)
We have established that, in the context of free actions of Tn ⊕ Rn on a standard
Borel space X, we can build the appropriate marker sets, construct the partitions of
the orbit equivalence classes into rectangular regions which are also Tn -invariant,
and also make the necessary adjustments to those regions in order to follow the
Gao-Jackson machinery of [2]. And thus we may run essentially the same geometric
construction of a sequence of orthogonal marker regions.
In particular, the proof of Lemma 5.2 of [2] depends on the same sort of adjustment of faces and subdivision of the polyhedral regions that we have illustrated in
the proof of our Theorem 5.6, and since the large scale geometry of Rn is the same
as for Zn , only very superficial changes need be made in order to follow the same
procedure for our Borel regions in Rn as for their clopen regions in Zn . (That we
have really been working in (Rn × Tn )/Tn rather than Rn is a minor technicality as
we do so by simply treating entire Tn orbits as if they are Rn points, which is not a
problem since the Tn ’s are compact and so act smoothly and have Borel selectors.
Thus, we may obtain the following analogue to Lemma 5.2 of [2]:
Lemma 5.7. Let R1 , . . . , Rk be a sequence of Borel subequivalence relations of En
satisfying the following:
(i) On each En class, each Ri induces a partition into Tn -invariant half-open
polyhedral regions which are unions of Tn -invariant half-open rectangles
with edge lengths between d and 12d.
(ii) In any ρ-ball B of radius 100, 000 · 16nd in some En equivalence class, there
are at most b integers i such that one of the Ri regions has a face F which
intersects B.
Then there is a Borel subequivalence relation R̃dn ⊆ En satisfying:
(i) Each R̃dn class is a Tn -invariant half-open rectangular region with edge
lengths between 9d and 12d.
(ii) Every face of an R̃dn region is at least 9000n116n2 b d from any parallel face of
an Ri region (for any i).
Continuing to follow their procedure, we may construct a series of subequivalence
relations with the analogous properties and get a similar inductive lemma as the one
they arrive at for a free action of Z<ω . In particular, in the proof of the inductive
Lemma 6.1 of [2], we have the Rii partitions that we constructed in Theorem 5.6.
And when given the Rjj+1 , . . . , Rji−1 which for us are assumed to induce partitions
into Tn -invariant half-open polyhedral regions when restricted to Ej , then we may
still apply our Lemma 5.7 to produce a Borel Tn -invariant rectangular partition R̃
which is orthogonal to them. And so then we may define Rji in the same way by

ABELIAN GROUP ACTIONS AND HYPERSMOOTH EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

23

letting
i
xRji y ⇔ c([x]R̃ )Rj+1
c([y]R̃ ).

where we may still let c(A) for an R̃ class A be a center point of A since Tn is
compact and therefore ETXn has a Borel selector. Hence we may define c(A) by
applying a Borel selector to the unique ETXn class of points in A which are equally
ρX -distant from each pair of parallel faces of A. Note then that Rji is also Borel.
Thus, we have the following analogue to Lemma 6.1 of [2].
Lemma 5.8. Let j < i. Let dj+1 , dj be positive reals with dj+1 ≫ dj (the exi
act condition necessary is specified below). Suppose Rj+1
is a Borel subequivalence

relation of Ei ⊆ E. Assume that the restriction of Rj+1

duces a partition into T -invariant polyhedral regions each of which is a union
of Tj+1 -invariant half-open rectangles with edge lengths between dj+1 and 12dj+1 .

⊆ Ek for all j < k ≤ i − 1.
j
(ii) Rj induces a partition of each Ej class into Tj -invariant half-open rectangular regions with edge lengths from [dj , dj + ε).
(iii) For j < k ≤ i−1, the restriction of Rjk to each Ej class gives a partition into
Tj -invariant polyhedral regions R each of which is a union of Tj -invariant
half-open rectangles with edge lengths between 9dj and 12dj .
(iv) On each Ej class, for each region R induced by the restriction of Rjk , there
k
such that each face of R
is a region R′ induced by the restriction of Rj+1

is within 12dj of a face of R .
(v) In any ball B of radius 100, 000 · 16j dj contained in an Ej class, there are
at most j + 1 many k with j < k ≤ i − 1 such that some region induced by
the restriction of Rjk has a face intersecting B.
(vi) For any j < k1 < k2 ≤ i − 1, and regions R1 , R2 contained in an Ej class
induced by the restrictions of Rjk1 , Rjk2 respectively, if F1 , F2 are parallel
faces of R1 , R2 , then ρ(F1 , F2 ) > 9000j 161j2 (j+1) dj .

Then there is a Borel subequivalence relation Rji ⊆ Ei satisfying the following:
(i) On each Ej class, Rji induces a partition into Tj -invariant polyhedral regions R each of which is a union of Tj -invariant half-open rectangles with
edge lengths between 9dj and 12dj .
(ii) On each Ej class, for each region R induced by Rji , there is a region R′

restricted to the Ej class such that each face of R is within
12dj of a face of R′ .
(iii) Condition (v) continues to hold, where now j < k ≤ i.
(iv) Condition (vi) continues to hold, where now j < k ≤ i.
We argue now that this construction still gives us what we need in our more
general context of T<ω ⊕ R<ω acting on X. Namely, we have the following lemma:

Lemma 5.9. Given a free action of T<ω ⊕ R<ω on a standard Borel space X and
its induced orbit equivalence relation E, we can construct a sequence {Rn }∞
n=1 of

have xRn y.
Proof. Fix a sufficiently fast growing sequence ε ≪ 1 ≪ d1 ≪ d2 ≪ · · · . And for
each i, let Rii be the subequivalence relation of Ei given by Theorem 5.6. Inductively
i
on i we define the subequivalence relations Rii , Ri−1

satisfy the

hypotheses of Lemma 5.8. We then get Rj from Lemma 5.8. From Lemma 5.8,
we are able to define Rji so that the resulting sequences of subequivalence relations
continue to satisfy these hypotheses.

So, we may assume the Rji ’s are defined for all i ≥ 1 and all 1 ≤ j ≤ i, and they
satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma 5.8. We show then that if x, y ∈ X and xEy, then
for all large enough i we have xR1i y, and hence we have the result of the lemma
where we take each Rn to be R1n .

To see this, suppose xEy, let k0 be large enough so that xEk0 y, and let (⇀

Tk0 ⊕Rk0 be such that y = ( t , r )· x. Now, suppose for contradiction that I = {i ≥

Note that still (c t , c r ) ∈ T 0 ⊕ R 0 and hence zEk0 x. Letting J ⊆ I be the set
of all i ∈ I where z’s distance from the boundary of x’s R1i region is < ε, we then
fix k > k0 and consider k + 1 many elements of J which are greater than k, say
i1 < . . . < ik+1 . Then, for each 1 ≤ m ≤ k + 1, conclusion (ii) of Lemma 5.8 can
be applied iteratively to say that there must be a point um on a boundary face Fm
of a region induced by the restriction of Rkim to z’s Ek class so that
ρ(B(z, ε), um ) ≤ 12(d1 + d2 + · · · + dk−1 ).
Hence any two of those faces must be be within 24(d1 + d2 + · · · + dk−1 ) + 2ε of
each other. But then since each of these Fm ’s are (k − 1)-dimensional hyperplanes
in a k-dimensional space and there are k + 1 many of them, two of them must be

So we have a contradiction and I = {i ≥ 1 : ¬(xR1i y)} must be finite.

5.5. Hypersmoothness of the Free Actions.
Theorem 5.10. Suppose E is the orbit equivalence relation on a standard Borel
space X induced by a free Borel action of T<ω ⊕ R<ω . Then E is hypersmooth.
Proof. For each n ≥ 1, let En be the subequivalence relation induced by the action
of Tn ⊕ Rn , and note that xEy if and only if xEn y for some n. By Lemma 5.9, we
may let {Rn }∞
n=1 be a sequence of subequivalence relations of E such that Rn ⊆ En
for each n, and if xEy then xRn y for all large enough n.
Now, we show that the construction of the Rn ’s provides us a way to choose a
point from each Rn class. To do this, note that the construction of Rn = R1n from
the proof of Lemma 5.9 is such that we may define the “center” of an R1n class of x
as the center of the rectangular Rnn class which is closest to its R1n class. To be more
precise, we define the “center torus” Cn (x) to be Tn · z where z ∈ Rnn is any point
equally ρX -distant from the edges of the unique Rnn class which is within Hausdorff
distance 12d1 + · · · + 12di−1 to the R1n class of x. (Note that this definition does
not depend on the choice of z.) Then, since Tn is compact it follows that ETXn has
a Borel selector sn : X → X such that sn (x) ∈ Tn · x and sn (x) = sn (y) for all
y ∈ Tn · x. And so we define
φn (x) = sn (Cn (x)).
Since each φn (x) ∈ [x]E , it follows that if φn (x) = φn (y) for any n then xEy.
Also, if xEy then we have xRn y and hence φn (x) = φn (y) for all large enough n.
Letting π : X → R be a Borel bijection, it follows that
f (x) = (π(φ1 (x)), π(φ2 (x)), π(φ3 (x)), . . .)
is a Borel reduction of E to E1 .



And finally we show that any sum of Rs and Ts must provide hypersmooth orbits
with its free actions.

space X which is induced by a free Borel action, a : G × X → X, of

L
γ ′ = 0 if γ = ω, and γ ′ = ω if γ is finite. (Where λ = 0, we identify λ A with the
trivial group {0}.) Then, define the isomorphism π : T<ω ⊕ R<ω → G × H by

0 if γ = ω, and
⇀∗
r = (rγ+n )n∈ω if γ is finite.
Now, define the action of G × H on X × H by letting (g, h) · (x, h′ ) = (a(g, x), h +
′
h ), and note that this is a free action. Then, f : X → X × H defined by f (x) =
X×H
(x, eH ) is a reduction of E to EG×H
since a(g, x) = y implies (g, eH ) · (x, eH ) =
(y, eH ), and (g, h) · (x, eH ) = (a(g, x), h + eH ) = (y, eH ) implies h = eH and hence
∃g ∈ G(a(g, x) = y). Since G × H is isomorphic to T<ω ⊕ R<ω and is acting freely
X×H
is hypersmooth by Theorem 5.10, and this shows that E must
on X × H, EG×H
also be hypersmooth.

6. Proof of the Main Theorems
Finally, we have everything needed to prove the main theorems.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Suppose an equivalence relation E on a standard Borel
space is induced by a Borel action of a group which is isomorphic to the sum of a
countable abelian group A with a countable sum of copies of R and T. By Theorem
3.4, E is Borel reducible to an equivalence relation ERX<ω which is induced by a
Borel action of R<ω on some standard Borel space X. Then by Theorem 4.9 this
ERX<ω is a countable disjoint union of equivalence relations each of which is induced
by a free action of a countable sum of copies of R and T, and by Corollary 5.11
each of these is hypersmooth. By Lemma 2.7, this means ERX<ω is hypersmooth.
Hence E is hypersmooth.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Suppose an equivalence relation E on a standard Borel
space X is induced by a Borel action of a second countable (hence Polish) LCA
group. By Theorem 3.3, E is Borel reducible to an equivalence relation which is
induced by a Borel action of Rn × Z<ω , for some non-negative integer n, on a Borel
subset Y ⊆ X, which is hypersmooth by Theorem 1.1. Hence E is hypersmooth. As
an action of a locally compact Polish group, E is also essentially countable by Corollary 2.17. Thus, by Corollary 2.10, it must be that E is essentially hyperfinite. 
7. A Conjecture of Ding, Gao, and Hjorth
The following, first mentioned by Hjorth in [18] as what would be an appealing
conjecture and then posed as such by Ding and Gao in [4], would provide a significant improvement to Hjorth’s ℓ1 dichotomy in [18]. The evidence for it has kept
growing as we have seen answers to the countable case in [2], the non-archimedean
case in [4], and other cases here. However, this question remains very much open.
Conjecture 7.1. Let G be any abelian Polish group acting in a Borel manner on a
X
Polish space X. If E ≤B EG
and E is essentially countable, then E is essentially
hyperfinite.
