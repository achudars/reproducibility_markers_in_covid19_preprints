Kerui Li, Student Member, IEEE, Siew-Chong Tan, Senior Member, IEEE, and Ron Shu Yuen Hui, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract-A single-switch-regulated wireless power transfer
(WPT) receiver is presented in this letter. Aiming at low-cost
applications, the system involves only a single-switch class-E
resonant rectifier, a frequency synchronization circuit, and a
microcontroller. The number of power semiconductor devices
required in this circuit is minimal. Only one active switch is used
and no diode is required. As a single-switch solution, this simplifies
circuit implementation, improves reliability, and lowers hardware
cost. The single-switch resonant rectifier provides a relatively
constant quasi-sinusoidal voltage waveform to pick up the wireless
power from the receiver coil. Due to the resonant nature of the
rectifier, ZVS turn on and turn off are achieved. The steady-state
analysis and discussions on the component sizing and the control
design are provided. A prototype is built and experimental works
are performed to verify the features: achieving 93% efficiency
single-switch AC-DC rectification (85% including the auxiliary
circuit), −7.17dB THD AC voltage waveform, ZVS turn on and
turn off over wide load range, 0.4% output voltage regulation
error, 79% cost reduction as compared with the Qi- compliant
receivers, 2.5% overshoot/undershoot after load disturbances, and
1% overshoot after line disturbance.

I. INTRODUCTION
The consumer electronics industry is experiencing rapid
development over the last few years. Many portable electronic
devices are shifting from cable charging to wireless charging.
Several works on cost-effective and reliable wireless power
transfer (WPT) receiver have been reported [1], [2]. In the
context of cost-effective and reliable power electronics design,
the number of power semiconductor devices is one of the
critical concerns. Consequently, minimizing the number of
power semiconductor devices in designing a regulated WPT
receiver has been explored and is presented in this letter.
In terms of high-frequency rectification, the passive diode
bridge rectifier with a post regulator is the most common
solution [3]. While generally straightforward and effective, this
is a relatively expensive and unreliable solution as it involves
quite many power semiconductor devices. Moreover, due to the
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation of the diode
bridge at light load power, considerable current surge is
generated at the transmitter coil of the WPT system [4]. This
may lead to overcurrent of the transmitter switches and
overvoltage of its compensated capacitor, thereby aggravating
the reliability issue.
The reconfigurable diode-bridge rectifier (with five power
switches) has been proposed as a high-frequency WPT receiver
to replace the use of full-bridge diode rectifier [5] in consumer
electronic applications. The DC regulation is achieved by mode
switching at particular moments, which leads to discontinuous
output regulation and extra low-frequency output ripples. To
further reduce the use of active power switches, the active fullbridge rectifier (with four power switches) has been proposed
[6][8]. It can achieve high-frequency DC regulation without a
post regulator and can avoid the current surge issue. However,

the high switching frequency operation imposes demanding
challenges on the synchronization of the high-side and low-side
switches, of which failure will lead to a direct short circuit of
the source or load. For safe operation, introducing dead time
into the switching process is inevitable. Nevertheless, this is not
a fool-proof solution and possible electrical faults of the switch
or driver, as well as signal noise, may still cause a direct short
circuit of a bridge circuit that operates at high frequency.
Alternatively, a simpler active rectifier solution based on the
half-bridge rectifier can be used [9]. It provides a similar
function to that of the full-bridge rectifier, but possesses a
simpler structure and lower cost. Nevertheless, comprising still
with a half-bridge inverter circuit, it suffers from the same
reliability issues as those of the active full-bridge rectifier. To
resolve this, it is necessary to adopt topologies that do not
contain the half-bridge inverter structure. For this reason, a
single-switch solution would be preferred in terms of achieving
low cost and improved reliability.
Notably, the active class E rectifier is currently the only
possible candidate for achieving a single-switch rectifier
solution. Unfortunately, the use of class E rectifier to achieve
DC regulation is rarely reported. Incorporation of a post
regulator is the common approach towards addressing the
regulation issue [10]-[12]. However, this again is cost
ineffective. It, therefore, raises the question as to whether it is
possible to realize high-frequency rectification and regulation
altogether using a truly single-switch solution.
In this letter, our investigation on the feasibility of using a
single-switch solution based on the class E rectifier in realizing
simultaneously the high-frequency rectification and DC
regulation, is reported. Our proposed WPT receiver system
comprises only a single-switch class-E resonant rectifier, a
frequency synchronization circuit, and a microcontroller. It
uses the minimum number of power semiconductor devices
possible (i.e., one power MOSFET) and no diode is required.
The frequency synchronization circuit is used to lock up the
frequency and phase of the current of the receiver coil. By using
the microcontroller to control the phase-shift angle between the
AC voltage of the rectifier and the current of the receiver coil,
the real input power can be controlled, which thereby achieves
the regulation of the DC output voltage. To achieve such
control, a new design method is proposed and will be discussed
in this letter.
II. PROPOSED SINGLE-SWITCH REGULATED RESONANT
WPT RECEIVER SYSTEM
A. Circuit Configuration
As depicted in Fig. 1, the single-switch regulated resonant
WPT receiver involves the compensated receiver coil (Ls and
Cs), the single-switch resonant rectifier circuit (Cf, Lf, Co, R and
S), the synchronization circuit, and the microcontroller (MCU).

As compared to conventional class E rectifiers [10], the
inductance Lf of the proposed system is significantly reduced,
enabling the use of air core inductor. Moreover, the voltage
waveform of the main switch (vCfs) is invariant to load change.
This assures that voltage stress of the main switch is constant
and ZVS operation is achievable over a wide load range.
B. Operating Principles
In elaborating the operating principles, the following
assumptions are adopted:
1) the equivalent series resistance of the reactive
components are sufficiently small and negligible;
2) the quality factor of the resonant tank LsCs is sufficiently
high, of which only the fundamental component of the electrical
current can be passed;
3) the output capacitor CO is relatively large such that its
voltage is a relatively constant DC output.
Due to the nature of series-series compensation, the phase
angle and amplitude of the secondary current iLs are only
dependent on the transmitter side AC voltage and the coupling
coefficient M, and not the load [14]. Therefore, its amplitude
and phase angle will remain constant throughout the operation.
The key waveforms of the single-switch-regulated resonant
WPT receiver are depicted in Fig. 2. The synchronization
circuit is operated to detect the zero crossing point of the current
iLs and sends a square-pulse synchronization signal sync to the
microcontroller. This provides the phase angle and frequency

information of iLs. With this information, the synchronized
PWM signal vgs that has 50% duty cycle and the phase-shift
ratio of D (0≤D≤0.25), is generated. There are two operation
modes for this circuit: Mode 1 occurs in the time period of t
where nTs ≤ t < (0.5+n)Ts, and Mode 2 occurs in the time period
t where (0.5+n)Ts ≤ t < (1+n)Ts for n = 0, 1, 2, .… The
corresponding equivalent circuit models are shown in Fig. 3.
Mode 1 [At time nTs ≤ t < (0.5+n)Ts]
In Mode 1 (see Fig. 3(a)), the main switch S is in the onstate. The current iLs of the wireless coil is freewheeled through
switch S. Consequently, the voltage of capacitor Cf remains
zero, i.e.,
𝑣

(1)
Meanwhile, inductor Lf discharges its stored energy linearly
with a current of iLf to the output capacitor Co, of which provides
a relatively constant current to load R, such that

At time t=(0.5+n)Ts, switch S is turned off under ZVS turn off
as vcf is zero volt.
Mode 2 [At time (0.5+n)Ts ≤ t < (1+n)Ts]
In Mode 2 (see Fig. 3(b)), switch S is in the off-state. Here,
current iLs flows through the resonant tank Lf Cf, such that

The resonant frequency of the resonant tank Lf Cf is very close
to the switching frequency (fs). Thus, the waveform of vCf is
sinusoidal-like, involving the resonance of Lf and Cf. With the
gradual increase of voltage on Cf, the ZVS turn-on condition is
achieved. Meanwhile, current iLf concurrently charges the
output capacitor Co and provides current to load R, such that

At time t=nTs, the voltage level of vcf reaches zero (after

(10)

Eq. (10) indicates that the output current io or the output voltage
vo can be regulated by adjusting D. Note that the output current
is load independent. From the perspective of the load, the output
from the rectifier is a constant current source, which is good for
constant current charging. In contrast, because of this current
source nature, the output voltage is highly load-dependent, and
a feedback control loop is required to regulate the output
voltage.
III. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
A. Design of Resonant Rectifier (Lf, Cf, and Co)
Two design objectives are imposed when designing Lf and
Cf: 1) AC voltage waveform of vCf must be maintained
relatively constant for all loads; 2) ZVS operation must be
enforced for all loads.
As shown in (4), the voltage waveform vCf involves the
contribution of the resonant current iLf, load current (vo/R), and
the current of the receiver coil iLs. To ensure a relatively
constant waveform regardless of the load and the current from
the receiver coil (1st design objective), the characteristic
admittance Cf /Lf has to be sufficiently large so that the
resonant current (highlighted in (8)) is dominant. However, the
increased characteristic admittance will lead to large reactive
power and unnecessary conduction loss. As a result, the
characteristic admittance is designed as

where max(|ILs|) and min(vo) are the maximum and minimum
values of the current of receiver coil iLs and output voltage vo.
To achieve ZVS operation, the voltage waveform of vCf should
be zero at time 0.5Ts and Ts, i.e. vCf(0.5Ts)= vCf(Ts)=0. Meeting
ZVS operation requirement (2nd design objective), the
resonance frequency of Lf and Cf is then designed as

Using (11) and (12), the corresponding values of Lf and Cf are
obtained.
The design objective of Co is to reduce the output ripple to be
less than x% of the nominal value. According to (6), the output
ripple is contributed by inductor current iLf and output current
(vo/R). Consequently, the output capacitor is designed as
𝐶

5.41𝐶

(13)

As shown in Fig. 4, a set of feasible values Lf and Cf can be
obtained by solving the cross section points of (11) and (12).
Then, the minimum value of Co is calculated via (13) using the
maximum value of Cf.
B. Frequency and Phase Synchronization
As shown in Fig. 5, the external circuit sends the
synchronization signal sync to MCU TMS320F28335 via
GPIO32, which is specified for PWM synchronization. After
receiving the synchronization signal, the frequency of the PWM
modules is synchronized. As shown in Fig. 2, the time-based
counter TBCTR restarts counting from zero after detecting the
rising edge of the synchronization signal sync. Using the
counter-compare (CMP) and TBCTR, synchronized PWM 1
with 50% duty cycle is generated. The phase angle difference
between PWM 1 and the resonant current iLs is a quarter of a
switching cycle (=0.25 Ts). Taking PWM 1 as the reference,
PWM 2 utilizes phase-shift ratio D, which is computed by the
control algorithm, to generate the required phase-shift PWM
signal vgs (PWM 2). As a result, the total phase shift between
vgs and iLs is (0.25+D)Ts. The resulted phase-shift PWM is then
used to drive the circuit into regulating the DC output voltage.

IV. COMPARISON
A comparison of the proposed system with existing WPT
receivers is provided in Table I. These solutions are compared
in terms of topologies, compensation of receiver coil, resonant
frequency, etc. As illustrated, the proposed receiver is the only
single-switch solution with output regulation. Its inherent ZVS
turn on and off operations make it an excellent candidate for
MHz WPT applications. The elimination of the post regulator
further simplifies the architecture of the receiver system. In
addition, with the single-switch configuration, the cost of the
proposed solution is reduced and the related direct short circuit
risk is prevented. The advantages over the two-stage solutions
[3], [11], are that the proposed solution achieves both regulation
and AC-DC rectification in one stage with the minimum
number of power switches. The advantages over the singlestage full-bridge based solution [6] and [7], are that the
proposed solution can realize high-frequency DC regulation
and secure soft switching.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A 200 kHz switching frequency, 24 V output, 16 W
prototype, as shown in Fig. 8, is built, with parameters Cf =76
nF, Lf =5.3 µH, Ls=164 µH, Cr=3.86 nF, and Co=3300 µF. Fig.
9 illustrates the calculated, simulated and measured efficiency
curves of the receiver. The maximum achievable efficiency in
the experiment is 93%. Fig. 10 shows a chart of the loss
distribution of the power stage. Fig. 11 and 12 show
respectively the curves of the output voltage versus the output
power, and that of the output voltage versus the distance
between two coils. The output voltage error for different
operating conditions is always less than 0.1 V (0.4% of the
nominal voltage), which verifies that the receiver is well
regulated in either variable load or variable coupling operation.
Fig. 13 shows the steady-state waveform of the receiver. It is
observed that both ZVS on and off operations are achieved. Fig.
14 shows the dynamic response for load step changes. The
output voltage has an overshoot of 0.6 V (2.5% of nominal
voltage) after the load power steps from 0 to full power. A
undershoot of 0.6 V (2.5% of nominal voltage) is present after
the load power steps down from full power to 0. Fig. 15 shows
the dynamic response of the system with the peak-to-peak value

of iLs stepping from 1 A to 1.6 A. A 0.3 V overshoot (≈1% of
nominal vs) is observed before it is regulated back to zero error.
These results verify that not only is the output voltage well
regulated in steady state at its nominal value with a relatively
low error, but it is also dynamically stable and well regulated
against disturbances of load power and input current changes.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This letter reports and shows that it is feasible to achieve a
single-switch regulated resonant WPT receiver using the active
class E rectifier topology. Our prototype and results validate
that by adopting phase-shift control and our proposed design
methodology, the WPT system can simultaneously achieve
high-frequency rectification, wide-load-range ZVS operation,
and accurate output regulation, without using any additional
post-regulator. As the system involves only one power
semiconductor device (no diode required), lower cost and
higher reliability as compared to existing WPT receivers, can
be expected.
