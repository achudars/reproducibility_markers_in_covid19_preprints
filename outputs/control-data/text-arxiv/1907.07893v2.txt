Abstract
Recently, Bi2O2Se is discovered as a promising two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor
for next generation electronics, due to its moderate bandgap size, high electron mobility
and pronounced ambient stability. Meanwhile, it has been predicted that high quality
Bi2O2Se-related heterostructures may possess exotic physical phenomena, such as
piezoelectricity and topological superconductivity. Herein, we report the first
successful heteroepitaxial growth of Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3 substrates via pulsed
laser deposition (PLD) method. Films obtained under optimal conditions show an
epitaxial growth with the c axis perpendicular to the film surface and the a and b axes
parallel to the substrate. The growth mode transition to three dimensional (3D) island
from quasi-2D layer of the heteroepitaxial Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates is
observed as prolonging deposition time of films. The maximum value of electron
mobility reaches 160 cm2/V-1s-1 at room temperature in a 70nm-thick film. The
thickness dependent mobility provides evidence that interface-scattering is likely to be
the limiting factor for the relatively low electron mobility at low temperature, implying
that the interface engineering as an effective method to tune the low temperature
electron mobility. Our work suggests the epitaxial Bi2O2Se films grown by PLD are
promising for both fundamental study and practical applications.

Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) layered Bi2O2Se is provoking immense interests owing to its
great potential for next generation electronics. As a novel 2D layered semiconductor,
Bi2O2Se was discovered to exhibit an ultrahigh electron mobility (>2×104 cm2V-1s-1) at
low temperatures[1]. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) study reveals that
Bi2O2Se hosts an unusual spatial uniformity of the bandgap (~0.8 eV) without undesired
in-gap states on the sample surface even with up to ~50% vacancy defects[2]. Moreover,
heat and humidity treatment experiments demonstrate ultrathin Bi2O2Se plates are
excellent in environmental stability[1], which is of great importance in the device
performance and reliability. Benefited from the above-mentioned advantages, Bi2O2Se
shows high performance in field effect transistors[1], photodetectors[3-5] and
magnetoresistance devices[6]. On the other hand, theoretical investigations have
predicted that Bi2O2Se possesses piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity upon a certain inplane strain[7], which could be achieved by epitaxial growth on the substrates with the
in-plane lattice constant a few percent larger than that of Bi2O2Se. Of even greater
interest, the heterostructures between Bi2O2Se and copper oxides as well as iron-based
superconductors are suggested to be candidates for exploring novel phenomena such as
topological superconductivity[2, 8, 9]. Therefore, successful preparation of epitaxial
films is important and prerequisite to explore both the exotic phenomena and potential
applications in Bi2O2Se and related heterostructures.
The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method has been developed to fabricate high
quality 2D Bi2O2Se films on various kinds of substrates, such as the Mica, SrTiO3,
LaAlO3 and MgO[10-12]. The ambient pressure vapor-solid growth approach for the
preparation of 2D Bi2O2Se nanosheets on the Mica is reported recently[13]. Pulsed laser
deposition, as one of the typical physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, has been
proven to be an alternative way to the CVD method to obtain the layered 2D materials
such as few-layer graphene[14], MoS2[15], WS2[16] and Boron Nitride[17]. The merits
of accurate replication of stoichiometry from bulk target to films, in-situ fabrication of
heterostructure via sequentially switching different targets without breaking the
vacuum make it potential in growing complex oxide film[18, 19], multiheterostructure[20] and superlattice[21] by PLD method. Therefore, PLD technique is
appealing for the growth of hetero-epitaxial Bi2O2Se films.
In this paper, we report the first successful epitaxial growth of Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3
(001) using PLD method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations demonstrate the
2

appropriate temperature for high quality Bi2O2Se epitaxial growth is 425°C. The growth
mode transition from the quasi-2D layer to 3D island is observed for the growth of
Bi2O2Se on SrTiO3 substrates by XRD and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal a sharp interface between
Bi2O2Se films and SrTiO3 substrates. The maximum of electron mobility reaches 160
cm2V-1s-1 at room temperature in a 70nm-thick film. Phonon-scattering is the main
mechanisms in determining the electron mobility in PLD-grown Bi2O2Se/SrTiO3
heterostructures at high temperatures. Meanwhile, the interface-scattering is the
limiting factor for the relatively low mobility at low temperatures indicated by the
thickness-dependent mobility. Our results provide a new method to fabricate Bi2O2Se
films and pave a way for exploring novel physical properties and potential applications
in Bi2O2Se-related heterostructures.
Results and discussion
Figure 1(a) shows the tetragonal crystal structure of Bi2O2Se, which can be regarded as
the alternative stacking of negatively charged planar Se layers and positively charged
Bi2O2 layers along c direction. Thus the weak electrostatic interactions hold the layers.
As shown in Figure 1(b), powder XRD patterns of home-made target can be well
indexed to the crystal structure of Bi2O2Se without other impurity phases. The deduced
lattice parameters a =3.886 Å and c = 12.202 Å are consistent with those published
previously[22].
Single crystalline SrTiO3 was chosen as the substrate in considering the small lattice
mismatch (~0.6%) with respect to Bi2O2Se. Figure 1(c) shows the out-of-plane 2θ−θ
patterns of Bi2O2Se thin films on SrTiO3 substrates under various growth substrate
temperature Ts. Films are not in crystallization under Ts=300℃. Increasing Ts to 400℃
leads to the formation of Bi2O2Se phase with the out-of-plane orientation along c-axis.
Small amount of impurity Bi8Se7 is detected as well, which is marked as asterisks (*)
in the Figure 1(c). At higher Ts of 425~450℃, only (00l) diffraction peaks from Bi2O2Se
can be observed without any secondary phases. With increasing of Ts from 450℃ to
500℃, the preferred out-of-plane orientation of Bi2O2Se films would evolve from (002)
to (013). At the highest Ts=550℃, no crystalline phases are found to form on substrates.
For clarity, the effects of substrate temperature on crystallization and orientation of
Bi2O2Se films are summarized in Figure 1(d). In the present work we mainly focus on
the Bi2O2Se films with (00l) preferred orientation.

We further checked the crystallinity of two 23nm-thick Bi2O2Se samples deposited at
425℃ and 450℃. As shown in Figure 2(a), the (004) diffraction peak of the films
prepared at 425℃ displays clearer Laue oscillation fringes, suggesting that the out-ofplane order is high and coherent over the entire film thickness. Accordingly, for
Ts=425℃, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Bi2O2Se (004) peak in
rocking curve was as narrow as 0.08°(the inset of Figure 2(b)), indicating a high degree
of crystallinity with low mosaicity. The FWHM value increases to 0.13°in 23 nm-thick
Bi2O2Se film deposited at 450℃, suggesting the relatively poor crystallinity. In order
to reveal the in-plane texture, the azimuthal ϕ scans of the off-axis {011} peaks of the
23 nm-thick Bi2O2Se films deposited at 425℃ were further performed. As shown in
Figure 2(c), four Bi2O2Se {011} peaks are spaced by 90 degrees and four STO {011}
peaks with the same spacing are also found at the same angular positions, suggesting
in-plane epitaxial growth. Hence, the optimized substrate temperature of 425℃ is
determined and the Bi2O2Se films discussed hereafter in the context are those prepared
at Ts=425℃. Figure 2(d) shows the (004) diffraction peaks of several Bi2O2Se films
with different thicknesses. With the increasing of Bi2O2Se thickness, the Laue
oscillation fringes around the (004) reflections gradually emerge. However, the fringes
are not clear in the ~50 nm-thick Bi2O2Se film (green line) and become undiscernible
in ~60 nm-thick sample (blue line). The evolvement of the Laue oscillation in Figure
2(d) implies a progressive relaxation of Bi2O2Se films with film thicknesses increasing.
As is shown in Figure 2(e), the lattice parameter c derived from (004) diffraction peak
decreases gradually with the increasing of films thicknesses, which is probably due to
the increasing of Se vacancies in the as-grown Bi2O2Se films generated during the
deposition. The variation of films thickness with deposition time shown in Figure 2f
indicates the growth rate is ~ 6 nm/min for Bi2O2Se grown on SrTiO3, which is about
10 times faster than that of the CVD method[12]. The relatively fast growth rate makes
it possible to produce high-quality Bi2O2Se-based semiconductor devices efficiently in
the future.
To further explore the nucleation and growth evolution, surface morphology of the
Bi2O2Se films at different growth stages was characterized by ex-situ AFM. Figure
3(a)-(d) represent the AFM images of four Bi2O2Se films deposited with 2~10 minutes.
At the beginning of the growth, the Bi2O2Se spices nucleate at the substrate surface and
grow up in the form of square-like shape 2D islands marked by yellow right angle in
Figure 3(a). The lateral size of the 2D island is several tens of nanometers and the
4

thickness is 5~6 nm, according to the height profile in Figure 3(e). The square-like 2D
islands also align along the same direction. As shown in Figure 3(b)-(c), with the
increase of the deposition time, the 2D islands grow up and gradually coalesce into
uniform and continuous Bi2O2Se thin films on the SrTiO3 substrate. The Bi2O2Se film
deposited with 6 minutes shows a relatively smooth surface with a root-mean square
(RMS) surface roughness of ~0.93 nm. Further increasing of the deposition time to 10
minutes results in the formation of 3D islands on the film surface, leading to a rather
large RMS surface roughness of~5.12 nm. Based on the above results, the schematic
diagrams of the entire growth processes are depicted in Figure 3(i)-(m). Growth mode
transition from the quasi-2D layer to 3D island growth can therefore be proposed in our
Bi2O2Se films deposited on SrTiO3 substrate by PLD. In the case of heteroepitaxial
growth, the thermodynamic factors, e.g. lattice misfit, are important for growth
mode[23]. The lattice mismatch between Bi2O2Se and SrTiO3 is considerably small
(~0.6%), implying that under proper growth conditions one should get very smooth
Bi2O2Se films, which would give clear Laue oscillation fringes around the Bragg peak,
as indicated in XRD patterns in Figure 2(d) (films with thickness less than 50 nm). In
addition, the morphology of the 2D island is affected by both thermodynamic and
kinetic factors, e.g. the crystal lattice symmetry of the substrates surface, the diffusion
rate of as-deposited adatoms on the substrate surface as well as at the step edges of 2D
islands[23]. Hence it is reasonable that the formation of square-like Bi2O2Se islands on
the SrTiO3 (001) substrates in a growth regime (temperature, pressure). Similar
phenomenon has been observed in the growth of Bi2O2Se/SrTiO3 using CVD
method[12]. As the growth proceeds, the elastic strain induced by the misfit between
the films and substrate is becoming large and would be relaxed accompanied by the
formation of 3D islands on the film surface. The absence of Laue oscillation fringes in
our Bi2O2Se films thicker than 50nm reflects the change of film surface roughening
(Figure 2(d)). The characterization of surface morphology of the Bi2O2Se films with
different thicknesses is consistent with Laue oscillation observed by XRD in θ-2θ scan.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping was used to examine the micro structure of the
optimized samples deposited at 425℃. As shown in Figure 4(a), the thickness of the
film measured from the cross sectional image is ~23 nm, consistent with the result
deduced from XRD data. With a higher magnification, the atomically sharp interface
between Bi2O2Se and SrTiO3 are observed in Figure 4(b). A well-defined space of ~0.60
5

nm obtained along the out of plane direction matches well with the monolayer thickness
of Bi2O2Se (0.61 nm). Figure 4(c) is the expanded view of the high-angle annular darkfield STEM (HAADF-STEM) image from the square area marked in Figure 3(b), which
clearly reveals the typical layered structure viewed along [001] direction of Bi 2O2Se.
Atomic resolution EDX mapping gives clear elemental analysis of the distribution of
Bi, O, Se along out of plane direction. As shown in Figure 4(d)-(f), the alternate
stacking of Bi2O2 layer and Se layer agrees well with the structure model of Bi2O2Se as
depicted in Figure 1(a).
Electrical transport measurements were performed on the Bi2O2Se films with different
thicknesses. Figure 5(a) shows temperature dependent sheet resistance（RS-T）curves
of the films with thicknesses ranging from ~27 nm to 83 nm. The films thinner than
~27 nm show insulating behaviors, which may results from the poor continuity in the
initial growth stage as discussed above. Besides, interface induced electron scattering
cannot be ruled out, which would be discussed later. The Bi2O2Se/SrTiO3 films show
metallic conducting behavior as the thickness increases. Hall resistance Rxy as a
function of the applied magnetic field B (Rxy-B curves) measured at 300K and 2K are
shown in Figure 4(b). The Rxy of all the Bi2O2Se films with different thicknesses show
linear dependence with B and the slopes of Rxy−B curves are negative, indicating the
electron carrier conducting behavior. The slope of the Rxy−B curve decreases as the
thickness increases, suggesting a much higher electron concentration in the thicker
samples. To make a quantitative comparison, 2D carrier concentration (n) and Hall
mobility (μH) for the Bi2O2Se/SrTiO3 films with different thicknesses are calculated and
summarized in Figure 4(c)-(d). The n and μH can be inferred from the equations: 𝑛 =
1

− 𝑒𝑅

𝐻

and 𝜇𝐻 = 𝑅

1
𝑆 𝑛𝑒

, respectively. RH is the Hall coefficient, which is defined as the

slope of the Rxy−B curve and e is the charge of an electron. As the thickness of the
Bi2O2Se film increases, μH at room temperature increases first, then approaches 120
cm2V-1s-1 for the 40 nm-thick film, and finally maintains the constant value of 120
cm2V-1s-1 for thicker samples. The maximum mobility is 160 cm2V-1s-1 in a 70nm-thick
Bi2O2Se film. Meanwhile n increases monotonically with increasing the thickness of
the Bi2O2Se films. The evolution of μH and n with thickness variation at 2K is similar
to that at room temperature, as shown in Figure 4(d).
Prior to discussing the scattering mechanism in our PLD-grown Bi2O2Se films, the
origin of n-type conducting and electron carrier density should be discussed.
Theoretically, there are three kinds of lattice defects acting as donors in Bi2O2Se,
6

including Se vacancies (VSe), O vacancies (VO) and Bi antisites at Se position (BiSe).
Due to the low formation energy of VSe, loss of Se element usually occurs and has been
found inducing electron doping effect in some selenides compounds[24, 25]. The high
vacuum conditions during the deposition process also gives rise to the generation of VSe
due to the high volatility of selenium. Considering that no extra selenium was added
purposely in Bi2O2Se target, the growth process can be regarded as Se-poor condition,
under which BiSe can unavoidably form as well. Oxygen vacancies are common defects
during oxide film growth process[18, 26], which probably contribute to the electron
doping in the Bi2O2Se films. Previous theoretical calculation reveals that the formation
energy of VO is much higher than those of VSe and BiSe under Se-poor condition[27,
28]. Therefore, VSe and BiSe are thought to be the main donor defects in our PLD-grown
Bi2O2Se films. As the growth of the films proceeds, it is reasonable that the VSe and
BiSe would accumulate and result in an increase of electron carrier concentration. The
thickness-dependent carrier concentration in PLD-grown Bi2O2Se varies in the order of
1013-1014 cm-2, comparable to the results reported previously[10, 12]. It is believed that
defects tuning in PLD-grown Bi2O2Se/SrTiO3 films can be realized through fine tuning
of the PLD parameters and proper target preparation. Defect engineering would be
helpful to further elucidate the origin of the carrier in Bi2O2Se/SrTiO3 films in future.
Based upon the foregoing discussion on the formation of electron carrier, next we try
to understand the evolution of μH as a function of sample thickness through analyzing
the scattering mechanism in PLD-grown Bi2O2Se films. The temperature dependence
of μH illustrated in Figure S3 demonstrates that phonon-scattering is the main
mechanism in our Bi2O2Se films at high temperatures, in accordance with the reported
bulk single crystal[22] and CVD-grown 2D films[1]. The thickness dependence of the
carrier density and mobility at high temperatures in Figure 5c shows that both the μH
and n increase as film thickness increases. Considering that the carrier density is an
indication of the Se vacancy level, therefore, the VSe has a minor contribution to the
electron scattering. Such a behavior agrees well to the proposed self-modulation-doping
mechanism[27], in which, the conduction layer and scattering center are separated
spatially. The saturation of the sheet resistance at low temperature (Figure 5a) indicates
that the charged defects dominate the carrier scattering at low temperatures. Two
distinct mobility evolution as function of thickness and carrier density are observed in
Figure 5c and d, which corresponds to different scattering mechanism respectively. The
high-temperature mobility is thickness and carrier density independent above a critical
7

value ~40 nm which is expected for the phonon dominated scattering; while in the
charged impurity dominated low-temperature case, the mobility increases as the carrier
density increases and builds up the screening[29]. Besides, an anomaly of drastically
drop of the carrier mobility (Figure 5c) and even insulating behavior at room
temperature as thickness decrease is observed, indicating the scattering from interface
charged impurity start to overwhelm the phonon scattering and finally lead to strong
localization. Another anomaly is the saturation and even the drop of the mobility as the
thickness reach a critical value ~70 nm at low temperature, which might be caused by
the growth mode changing induced charged impurity increase.
Finally, a comprehensive comparison of electrical properties among our PLD-grown
Bi2O2Se films and other samples fabricated by different methods are summarized in
table I. It can be found that the difference of mobility at 300K is relatively small for all
the samples, even though there is two orders of magnitude discrepancy among their
carrier densities. This is attributed to the phonon-dominating scattering at room
temperature. In contrast, the mobility at 2K varies greatly from the order of 102 cm2V1 -1

s to 105 cm2V-1s-1. Worth noticing that the samples with lower mobility at 2K also

show lower value of residual resistivity ratio (RRR=RS, 300K/RS, 2K), which probably due
to the defects in crystal lattice and disordered atom arrangement near interface as
discussed above. Compared with CVD-grown thin Bi2O2Se flakes on Mica substrates
by Peng’s group[10], the rather low mobility at 2K in our PLD-grown Bi2O2Se films
also strengthen these inferences arising from the use of different substrates and the
nature of the different growth methods. However, it is promising to realize further
improvement of electrical performance via interface and defects engineering in PLDgrown Bi2O2Se thin films.
Conclusion
In summary, we succeeded in growing high quality epitaxial Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3
substrates by PLD method. The evolvement of surface morphology with deposition
time demonstrates the growth mode transition from quasi-2D layer to 3D island of
heteroepitaxial Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates by PLD method. Transport
measurement results show phonon-limited electron carrier transport behaviors for the
Bi2O2Se/SrTiO3 heterostructures at room temperature. The maximum electron mobility
reaches 160 cm2/V-1s-1 at room temperature. Thickness dependent electrical transport
properties suggest that charge impurity is the limitation factor for the low temperature
8

mobility, especially for the very thin film, the interface defects play a destructive role
to the conductivity. Our work indicates that interface engineering of the heterostructure
films, such as pretreatment of the substrate surface or adding buffer layers, would be
necessary for the application of the Bi2O2Se film. Epitaxial Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3 by
PLD method provides a promising platform for exploring of exotic physical phenomena
and the potential device applications.
Materials and methods
Target fabrication
Polycrystalline Bi2O2Se targets were prepared by a two-step solid state reaction method.
Firstly, high-purity starting materials Bi2O3 (4N), Se (4N) and Bi (4N) powders were
loaded in Al2O3 crucibles, which were evacuated and sealed in quartz tubes. The tubes
were heated to 950℃ and kept for 24hrs to obtain the precursors. Secondly, to obtain
high density Bi2O2Se targets, the as-sintered precursors were ground thoroughly in an
argon-filled glovebox, followed by heat treatment for 12hrs in a hot-pressing (450℃
/6MPa) furnace. During this process, argon was continuously introduced to prevent the
unfavorable reaction between the target materials and the atmosphere. Finally, the asgrown targets were checked by a powder x-ray diffractometer (DX-2700) and no trace
impurities were detected.
Thin film deposition
The Bi2O2Se thin films were grown on SrTiO3 (001) single crystal substrates in a high
vacuum (∼10−5Pa) chamber by PLD. A KrF excimer laser (Coherent, COMPexPro201)
was employed to produce a 248-nm-wavelength laser beam. The energy density,
repetition rate and target-substrate distance were 150mJ/mm2, 4 Hz and 50mm,
respectively. The substrate temperature varied from 300°C to 550°C in order to find the
optimized deposition conditions. To facilitate the electrical transport measurements, the
films were patterned to Hall bar configuration (3mm×0.5mm) using a metal mask
during growth.
Structure and morphology characterization
The crystallinity and the lattice parameters of the as-grown films were evaluated by Xray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D8 Discover) with Cu Kα radiation using the high
resolution mode. Surface morphology was observed by atomic force microscopy
(Bruker, Dimension ICON). A step profile tester (Bruker, Dektak-XT) was employed
for a convenient thickness measurement of Bi2O2Se films. The microstructure
examinations of the films were performed by transmission electron microscopy (JEOL,
9

JEM-ARM300F). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron
microscopy (HAADF-STEM) using a double spherical aberration probe corrector was
conducted to examine the atoms arrangement at the interface between Bi2O2Se films
and SrTiO3 substrates. The energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDX) provided
outstanding sensitivity to determine elements with atomic resolution.
Electrical transport measurements
The transport properties of the films were carried out using Physical Properties
Measurement System (Quantum Design, Dynacool). The temperature dependent
resistance was measured from 2K to 300 K and Hall measurements were taken with
magnetic fields of up to 9T applied perpendicular to the film surface at 2K and 300K,
respectively. Metallic indium was used to form favorable ohmic contacts (see Figure
S2).

Electrical measurements of Bi2O2Se thin films

Figure S2. Ohmic contact tests of a 42nm-thick Bi2O2Se film. (a) Photograph of sixterminal shape Bi2O2Se film for electrical transport measurements. Metallic Indium
was used to attach the current (1, 4) and voltage (2, 3, 5, 6) leads. (b)-(c) The Ohmic
contact electrodes were tested through 2-probe and 4-probe I-V curves at 300K and 2K,
respectively.

Linear characteristics of the I-V curves indicates the Ohmic contacts

were formed between Indium and Bi2O2Se films. (d) Temperature-dependent 2-probe
and 4-probe resistance of Bi2O2Se thin film. The metallic-like conducting behavior of
2-probe R-T curve demonstrates the good contact formed between electrode and films.

Figure S3. Electrical properties measurements and air-stability test of a Bi2O2Se film
with 42 nm thickness. (a) Rs-T curves of the as-grown sample and that exposed to air
for ~3 months. The two Rs-T curves almost coincide with each other. (b) Temperature
dependent Hall mobility and carrier concentration of the as-grown sample and that
exposed to air for ~3 months. As the temperature decreases, the hall mobility increases
which demonstrates phonon scattering is the main mechanism in the PLD-grown
Bi2O2Se films. The exposure to atmosphere for ~3 months leads to a slight increase in
the electron concentration of Bi2O2Se films. The exact mechanism behind the change
in carrier density in Bi2O2Se films is not well known, which is thought to be due to
adsorption of other gasses on the film surface. The little changes in sheet resistance and
electron carrier density result in the slight decrease in Hall mobility μ H. Above results
demonstrate that the PLD-grown Bi2O2Se films with good air-stability have great
potential applications in electronics.
