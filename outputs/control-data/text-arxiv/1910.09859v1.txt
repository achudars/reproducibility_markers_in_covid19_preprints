Distinctive superconducting behaviors between bulk and monolayer
FeSe make it challenging to obtain a unified picture of all FeSe-based
superconductors. We investigate the ultrafast quasiparticle (QP) dynamics
of an intercalated superconductor (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe, which is a bulk
crystal but shares a similar electronic structure with single-layer FeSe on
SrTiO3. We obtain the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant λA1g (0.22
±0.04), which well bridges that of bulk FeSe crystal and single-layer FeSe
on SrTiO3. Moreover, we find that such a positive correlation between λA1g
and

superconducting

Tc

holds

among

all

known

FeSe-based

superconductors, even in line with reported FeAs-based superconductors.
Our observation indicates possible universal role of EPC in the
superconductivity of all known categories of iron-based superconductors,
which is a critical step towards achieving a unified superconducting
mechanism for all iron-based superconductors.

Most

high-temperature

superconductors

exhibit

quasi-two-dimensional

superconducting (SC) layers. However, a unified physical picture of the FeSe-based [1]
and FeAs-based superconductors [2] remains elusive thus far, regardless of the common
layered feature they share. The recent discoveries of single-layer FeSe (on SrTiO3 or
similar substrates) interface superconductors [3] and (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe intercalated
superconductors [4] seemingly reinforced this uncertainty. However, by examining
these newly discovered crucial types of superconductors, possible connections among
all categories of iron-based superconductors can be uncovered, leading towards a
universal picture of them all.
In this Letter, we investigate the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) strength in
these superconductors by using ultrafast spectroscopy [5-9] to gain insights into a
unified understanding of iron-based superconductors. Ultrafast spectroscopy of ironbased superconductors has been previously reported extensively [5,6,10-12], mainly
identifying the SC transition and obtaining the SC parameters. Here we focus on the
EPC and make a systematic investigation of its relationship to superconductivity.
Specifically, we probe the excited state quasiparticle (QP) dynamics of a bulk crystal
(Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se [13]. This technique allows direct observation of the QP
lifetime, uncovering the phenomena above the SC gap and across the SC transition.
Light pulses break the Cooper pairs and generate excited-state QPs, which recombine
with a lifetime determined mainly by the EPC [5,6]. The stronger the EPC, the faster
the energy transfer through EPC, and hence, the shorter the lifetime. We determine the
EPC strength to be λA1g = 0.22 ±0.04, which is larger than that of bulk FeSe (λA1g = 0.16)

[5] and smaller than that of single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 (λA1g = 0.48) [6].
(Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe materials [4,13,14] consist of staggered stack of Fe1-ySe and
(Li1-xFex)OH layers; this structure is analogous to that of KxFe2Se2 [15], but with the
P4/nmm space group instead of the I4/m space group. The electronic band structure of
(Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe is similar to that of single layer FeSe/SrTiO3 [16] and bulk RbxFe2ySe2 [17]. As a result, (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe forms a key bridge between bulk FeSe, AxFe2-

ySe2

(A = K, Rb, Cs, Tl/K), and single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 superconductors. To some

extent, (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe provides an excellent platform for gaining insights into the
shared SC origin of these materials [13,16-18].
In this Letter, we demonstrate that the λA1g value of (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe bridges
those of bulk FeSe, Fe1.02Se0.2Te0.8, Fe1.05Se0.2Te0.8, KxFe2Se2 and single-layer
FeSe/SrTiO3. Significantly, by examining this and the reported λA1g values measured
using ultrafast spectroscopy for many FeSe-based and FeAs-based superconductors, as
well as those calculated in theory, we discover a positive correlation between the EPC
strength λA1g and the SC transition temperature Tc. Our results indicate the possible
important role of EPC in the superconductivity for all categories of iron-based
superconductors, thus contributing to a unified understanding of the SC mechanism.
Ultrafast laser pulses with a central wavelength of 800 nm, 70 fs pulse width and
250 kHz repetition rate are used to excite and probe the dynamics of QPs, as well as to
generate and detect coherent phonons, in a (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se single crystal. The
time-resolved pump-probe weak detection experimental setup is similar to that of Ref.
[6], with the polarizations of the pump and probe beams being perpendicular to each

other to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, a balanced detector is used to
further improve the signal. When the pump pulses arrive at the sample, a very small
portion of the paired (if in the SC state) electrons are promoted to the excited states far
above the SC gap, forming QPs that relax gradually thereafter to the ground state.
Our sample is synthesized via a hydrothermal ion-exchange technique, the details
of which are described in Ref. [13]. The measured sample is 1.2×2 mm2-sized,
composing of micron-sized single-crystal flakes, and is kept in a refrigerator to prevent
degradation before and after the experiments. Its surface is not entirely optical flat,
resulting in diffusive reflections, which makes collecting the reflected beam and further
obtaining useful signals challenging.

the

of

our

(Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se sample (data are offset for clarity), with the schematic crystal
structure illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The value of ∆R/R reflects the transient change of the
refractive index, for which the electronic and lattice contributions can be clearly
separated [19]. In Fig. 1(a), ∆R/R is proportional to the density of the excited state QPs.
We color-map the complete set of data as a function of both temperature and time delay
in Fig. 1(c) (on the logarithmic scale for clarity). The color change reflects the evolution
of the QP density, which exhibits a phase transition at 40 K. This color change is similar
to that for the SC transition in the monolayer FeSe superconductor [6] and many others
[10]. The phase transition temperature 40 K is also similar to the reported SC Tc for
(Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe by other experimental methods [4,13,14,18].
To further verify that the color change represents a SC transition, we

quantitatively analyze the excited-state QP dynamics. The data in Fig. 1(c) can be fitted
very

well

by

using

two

dynamical

components,

as

R / R  Afast exp(t /  fast )  Aslow exp(t /  slow )  y0 , where Afast (Aslow) and τfast (τslow) are
the amplitude and lifetime of the fast (slow) component, respectively. For details of the
data fitting, see Supplemental Material [20]. The fast relaxation component Afastexp(t/τfast) mainly reflects the EPC, while the slow component Aslowexp(-t/τslow) mainly
reflects the phonon-phonon scattering. These two components together depict the
temporal density evolution of the excited-state QPs. These QPs form only a very small
portion of the electrons condensed into ground-state Cooper pairs [20]. The third term
y0 is a constant within the scanning range and slightly varies with temperature. Indeed,
it might be a component with a lifetime much longer than the scanning range [5,46],
which could be due to scatterings among acoustic phonons. We mainly focus on the fast
and slow components.
We investigate the temperature dependence of the QP dynamics. Figure 2(a)
shows that Afast behaves similar to that of single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 [6]. Figure 2(b)
demonstrates that τfast is nearly a constant for the whole temperature range. Figure 2(c)
exhibits that Aslow experiences a dramatic decrease near 39.5 K, similar to those in
monolayer FeSe/SrTiO3 [6] and other superconductors [47]. Figure 2(d) illustrates that
τslow forms a peak (i.e., enhanced QP lifetime) at 39.5 K, directly manifesting the wellknown phonon bottleneck effect. Microscopic detailed balancing between the excitedstate QPs and the high-frequency phonons (abbreviated as HFPs, defined by E > 2Δ(T))
dictates the cross-gap recombination of the QPs [6,11,47]. The photo-excited QPs relax

to the ground state to form Cooper pairs, accompanied by releasing of HFPs.
Conversely, the HFPs can break the Cooper pairs, generating excited-state QPs. Only
when HFPs decay or propagate away, will the detailed balance break [20], thus leading
to longer QP lifetimes owing to more phonons fulfilling the HFP criteria near Tc (due
to the SC gap closing). The simultaneous observation of the abrupt decrease in the
amplitude [Fig. 2(c)] and the lifetime maximum [Fig. 2(d)] at the same temperature
indicates a SC phase transition [6,47]. To further verify this, we quantitatively analyze
the temperature dependence of Aslow and τslow [20] by using the Rothwarf-Taylor (RT)
model [48] and its extended derivation [49]. The RT model was initially developed to
understand the superconducting behavior from the dynamical aspect. It describes the
detailed balance between the excited state QPs and the HFPs, involving the Cooper
pairs. The RT model is usually applicable when the weak detection condition [20] is
fulfilled. The curves based on this model for a superconductor are plotted in Figs. 2(c)
and 2(d) (red solid curves), respectively. Both model curves reveal that the Tc is 39.7 ±
0.5 K and the SC gap Δ(0) is 14.3 ± 1.2 meV. The density of thermally excited QPs, nT,
is also illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2(c). We thus identify Δ(0)/kBTc to have a value of
4.1, which is much larger than the BCS prediction Δ(0)/kBTc = 1.76. Here the evidence
and parameters of the SC transition are obtained by probing the excited-state ultrafast
dynamics, rather than by measuring the static near-Fermi-surface properties. The results
in Figs. 1 and 2 are obtained within the weak detection regime. By weak detection, we
propose two different levels of criteria: (A) no thermal effect and (B) no prominent
destruction of the SC component, which are both fulfilled in our experiment [20, see

Sections 3 and 4].
In the following paragraphs, we investigate the EPC. By measuring the QP
ultrafast dynamics under relatively high excitation laser fluence, the EPC constant λ can
be directly obtained. This is by using a phenomenological model by Allen [50], which
elucidates the relation between the QP relaxation rate and the EPC strength. It can be
applied to both superconductors and many other solids. In the model, the thermal
relaxation rate γT of the QPs is determined jointly by the EPC constant λ and the electron
temperature Te in a relation , where is the second moment of the Eliashberg function,
TL is the lattice temperature, and Ω is the phonon frequency. We measure the electron
temperature Te and the QP relaxation rate γT in our ultrafast dynamics experiment.
To obtain Te, note that the high order terms in the equation of γT are negligible
only when TeTL is relatively large, i.e., when (Ephonon)2 ≤ Eexcited-state electron ∙ Eground-state
electron,

which is fulfilled when the excited-state electron energy is much higher than the

optical phonon energy. This condition is fulfilled in high-fluence excitation, which is
implemented in our experiment, with a pump fluence of F = 2.2 mJ/cm2. We calculate
Te using the relation , where ls is the optical penetration depth, and κv = κρn is the
electronic heat capacity coefficient for unit volume, with κ being the electronic heat
capacity coefficient (Sommerfeld parameter) and ρn being the mole density [20]. By
interpreting κ = 100 mJ/(mol∙K2) from Ref. [4] and taking TL = 7 K, we obtain Te = 548
K. Because TL only affects Te less than a few Kelvin (when TL is relatively low), Te is
close to a constant [20].
By definition,  T

1 d (Te  TL )

[50]. It is known that the difference in

electron and lattice temperatures is proportional to the differential reflectivity, as (Te TL)∝ΔR/R [51]. Furthermore, at t→0, the fast component dominates. Thus we have
T 

1 d (R)
 1/  fast .
R dt t 0

Hence, we can directly measure γT through τfast in our time-

resolved ultrafast spectroscopy experiment. A typical ultrafast dynamical response
under such high fluence is shown in Fig. 3(a). Fitting the electronic dynamics (after
subtracting the overall dynamics of phonon oscillations) at a low temperature (TL = 7
K), we obtain after deconvolution that τfast = 0.34 ± 0.05 ps [20], where τfast is nearly
identical for all the low temperature values. This lifetime is longer than the 0.23 ps
lifetime of single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 system [6] and shorter than the 1.75 ps lifetime of
bulk FeSe [5]. Note that in the high fluence regime τfast increases with fluence, whereas
the value of λ remains constant [20]. With the above observed values of Te and γT we
derive that λ<Ω2> = 2.34×1026 Hz2 (i.e., 101 meV2).
The phonon information is needed before obtaining λ. We generate and detect
coherent phonons [52-55] in (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se with the same high pump (2.2
mJ/cm2) and probe (0.28 mJ/cm2) fluences, as shown in Fig. 3(a). We extract the
coherent oscillation and perform Fourier transformation to obtain its frequency [Fig.
3(a) inset], which is 5.11 THz (i.e., 21.2 meV or 171 cm-1). We assign it to be the A1g
mode of the Se atoms, which corresponds to layer breathing along the c-axis; and
ascribe its generation mechanism to be displacive excitation of coherent phonons [20].
The temperature dependence of the coherent phonon is investigated [Figs. 3(b-e)],
which exhibits a regular anharmonic phonon decay [20,52] [Fig. 3(e)]. Figures 3(c-e)
show that no structural phase transition is observed in the temperature range of 100-

180 K. The smoothness of our coherent phonon data also confirm the reliability of all
our varying-temperature experiments, including those for the QPs (for example, there
is no prominent sample motion, and the sample flake size turns out does form an actual
obstacle by our detection scheme).
Note that demonstrating the A1g phonon does not indicate that the A1g mode
phonon is exactly the pairing glue. So far, there is no consensus on which phonon mode
contributes most to the EPC strength λ. If we use the above measured A1g phonon
frequency, 21.2 meV, we only obtain a nominal EPC constant λA1g = 0.22 ± 0.04 [20],
instead of the EPC λ. In fact, nominal values of λA1g in superconductors are frequently
reported, however, in the name of λ [5,6,9,56,57]. Here, we clearly distinguish λA1g and
λ, which clearly illustrates important basic facts that are otherwise mixed, concealing
important conclusions. We found that (i) by distinguishing λA1g and λ, we are now able
to compare better the (many reported) experimental results with theoretical calculations;
(ii) the values of λA1g are all based on experimental facts, thus deserve consideration and
comparison; and (iii) significantly, both λA1g and λ exhibit positive correlations with Tc,
but not when λA1g and λ are mixed. The values of λA1g and λ can be related (converted
into each other) through the relation λA1g = λ(), which we derive based on Refs.
[50,58,59]: Taking the first term of the equation by Allen [50], which contains the
relation λ ∝ 1/<Ω2> by McMillan [59], we define λ<Ω2> ≡ λA1g<ΩA1g2> = λA1gΩA1g2,
where λA1g is the nominal EPC strength corresponding to the A1g mode phonon. Further,
in theoretical calculations, it is convention to take the Allen-Dynes treatment, where
logarithmic phonon frequency Ωlog is taken to be the overall average [58], thus we write

λ<Ω2> = λ<Ωlog2> = λΩlog2. Combining the two, we retrieve the values of λA1g by using
λA1g = λ(Ωlog2/ΩA1g2).
The EPC has been speculated to play an active role in certain individual types of
iron-based high-Tc superconductors, particularly such as the single-layer system
[3,6,60,61]. Here, instead, we contemplate on all categories of iron-based
superconductors. We plot the available Tc versus λA1g values for different optimally
doped iron-based superconductors in Fig. 4. To avoid systematic discrepancies due to
different experimental methods, we mainly summarize λA1g values obtained by using
time-resolved ultrafast optical spectroscopy (including time-resolved angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, red spheres and squares) [5,6,8,9,57,62], as well as
theoretical results (blue spheres and squares) [63-69]. A result from angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (golden sphere) is also included [60]. Note that some of
the data are retrieved by the authors [20]. Furthermore, we perform ultrafast optical
spectroscopy experiments on Fe1.05Te0.8Se0.2 (Tc = 10 K) and Fe1.01Te0.8Se0.2 (Tc = 13.5
K) single crystals, respectively. The experimental and analysis details are similar, and
we obtain the λA1g values to be 0.11 and 0.13, respectively [20]. All the experimental
results in Fig. 4 are (were) obtained by 800 nm laser beam excitations (except for bulk
FeSe [5] with 400 nm excitation). Because the QP lifetime is nearly constant at
relatively high energy [70], it is fully reasonable to make a comparison among these
results.
Significantly, all the data points are located within a purple stripe region centered
on a pink curve in Fig. 4, indicating a positive correlation between Tc and λA1g. Here

the pink curve is a revised version of Allen-Dynes formula [58], based on λA1g and ΩA1g
[20]. The Allen-Dynes formula reveals a positive correlation between λ and the SC Tc,
and it compares well with the experimental data mostly for conventional
superconductors. Similarly, we also plot available reported theoretical results of λ in
Fig. 4 (marked by light gray squares or spheres), which are located within a brown
stripe region centered on an orange curve (another revised version of Allen-Dynes
formula, based on λ and Ωlog [20]. Because λA1g and λ are explicitly distinguished here,
and EPC is considered systematically for the whole family of iron-based
superconductors, we are able to establish a hitherto unrecognized correlation between
Tc and λA1g (λ) for iron-based superconductors, using all the available theoretical and
experimental results. We emphasize that the positive correlation itself, rather than the
details of the fitting equations, is the most significant discovery.
Remarkably, bulk, single-layer, and intercalated iron-based superconductors all
obey these two correlations; and both FeSe- and FeAs-based superconductors obey the
same correlations as well [Fig. 4]. This observation strongly suggests that a shared SC
origin is ubiquitous in all categories of iron-based superconductors, whereby the EPC
plays a universal role. We speculate that such EPC may not be a conventional type of
EPC. Moreover, we do not rule out other origins in making important contributions to
the SC mechanism (for instance, spin interactions or charge modulations may affect the
EPC through modifying the electronic states or the phonons [20]).
In summary, we investigate the QP dynamics of (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se using
time-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy. By the temperature dependence measurements,

we identify the SC properties, such as the SC Tc and Δ values. More importantly, by the
QP lifetime, we obtained the EPC strength λA1g of (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se, along with
the λA1g for Fe1.05Te0.8Se0.2 and Fe1.01Te0.8Se0.2 by our additional experiments.
Significantly, we discover a positive correlation between Tc and the EPC strength, either
in the form of λA1g or λ. Our finding demonstrates the likely crucial role of phonon in
the high temperature SC mechanism for iron-based superconductors. Our experimental
result suggests the possible existence of a unified framework for understanding ironbased superconductors, including the monolayer system. Our investigation is a critical
step towards a unified superconducting mechanism for all iron-based superconductors.

1. THE 2 RELAXATION COMPONENTS OF THE QP DYNAMICS
We carefully fit the data to understand the dynamics components. Tentative
fittings using both 2- and 3-exponential functions are carried out for various low
temperatures, as shown in Fig. S1. To see the near time zero region clearly, we also
include the semi-log presentation in Figs. S1(e-h). Furthermore, to see the quality of
data fitting, the goodness-of-fit results are also illustrated in Figs. S1(i-n). It can be seen
from Figs. S1(a-h) that the 2-exponential model better fits the data, which is confirmed
by the analysis shown in Figs. S1(i-n) (the R2 value of 2-exponential fit is larger than
that of 3-exponential fit). Although the 3-exponential curve provides a result close to
the best fitting with the 2-exponential function, it yields a slow component with a
lifetime longer than 300 ps, which may be systematic artifacts, considering the 110 ps
scanning range, or anything related to thermal fluctuations. Thus, the QP dynamics
consists of two relaxation components, each being an exponential decay. This result

shows that our results are in accord with a two-temperature model (i.e., the so-called 2
TM model).

2. ROTHWARF-TAYLOR MODEL
The temperature dependence of the slow component can be fully explained by the

Rothwarf-Taylor model [1] and its significant extension derivations for ultrafast
processes [2]. In the following, we provide details of the derivations.
The density of the thermally excited QPs nT has a temperature dependence of [3,4]
𝑛 𝑇 ∝ √∆(𝑇)𝑇exp(−∆(𝑇)/𝑘𝐵 𝑇),

(1)

where ∆(𝑇) = ∆(0)tanh(Θ√𝑇𝑐 /𝑇 − 1) is the phenomenological SC gap [5,6], kB is
the Boltzmann constant, Θ is the parameter which reflects the coupling strength (which
is 1.77 for weak coupling case). Here, based on our data fitting, we take Θ to be 2.02,
which reveals a strong coupling in the SC state.
The Rothwarf-Taylor equation reads [1]

where n and N are the density of QPs and high-frequency phonons (HFPs), respectively,
I0 and J0 are the injection terms of QPs and HFPs, respectively, η and β are the Cooper
pair breaking and formation coefficients, respectively, Λ is the rate that phonons decay
into low-energy phonons or propagate away from the active region, and NT is the
density of thermally excited HFPs. Ignoring the injection terms (I0 and J0) and
considering only the strong bottleneck case, we have at t = ts
𝑑𝑛/𝑑𝑡 = 𝜂𝑁𝑠 − 𝛽𝑛𝑠2 = 0,

(4)

where ts is the time when the QPs assume their maximum density. Taking N(t = 0) = NT
+ ΔN and n(t = 0) = nT + Δn to be the number of HFPs and QPs at the excitation by
pump pulse (neither for the ground state nor for the t = ts maximum QP density point),
respectively, we obtain after simple derivation that, for t = ts,

Substituting Eq. (1) into Eq. (7), we can remove ΔN and Δn in Eq. (6) to obtain

where C is a constant containing η and β, and we have replaced A(T) by Aslow(T).
Equation (8) is the fitting equation used for Fig. 2(c) in the main text, where Δ(0) and
C are fitting parameters.
In parallel, regarding the lifetime, the ultrafast dynamics experiment directly
measures the QP decay rate defined as 𝜏 −1 = |

, where τ is the lifetime of

the slow component measured in our ultrafast time-resolved experiment, and n is a
function of temperature that approaches ns as t approaches ts. During the slow process,
the photo-excited QPs relax to the ground state and form Cooper pairs, accompanied
by releasing of HFPs. Conversely, the HFPs can break the Cooper pairs, generating
excited-state QPs. Only when HFPs decay or propagate away, will the detailed balance
break. The schematic plot is shown in Fig. S2 below.

break when the HFPs decay into lower energy excitations or propagating away from
the active region.

(10)

The temperature dependence of Λ depends on the magnitude of the SC gap as [4,7]
Λ ∝ ∆(𝑇) + 𝛼𝑇Δ(𝑇)4 .

(11)

The first term corresponds to a phonon generating one lower-energy phonon (or
propagating away from the active region), and the second term corresponds to a phonon
generating two lower-energy phonons. Thus, the corresponding lifetime follows [7]:

𝜏(𝑇) ∝ {[𝛿 + 2𝑛 𝑇 (𝑇)][Δ(𝑇) + 𝛼𝑇Δ(𝑇)4 ]}−1 ,

(12)

where Δ(0), δ, and α are fitting parameters, and we have replaced τ(T) by τslow(T).
Equation (12) is the fitting equation used for Fig. 2(d) in the main text. The abrupt
reduction in Aslow and prominent increase in τslow at approximately Tc (Figs. 2c and d)
are both attributed to the gradually vanishing SC gap with increasing temperature.

3. WEAK DETECTION CONDITION: (A) NO THERMAL EFFECT
By weak detection, we propose two different levels of criteria: (A) no thermal
effect and (B) no prominent destruction of the SC component. For criterion (A), we
have three aspects of verifications as follows.
3.1 Linear fluence dependence range
We measure the fluence dependence of the QP dynamics, as shown in Fig. S3(a),
with the interference artifact at the so-called time-zero removed for clarity. We also
measure the fluence-dependent ultrafast dynamics at several typical temperatures with
fluences ranging from 4.2 to 70 µJ/cm2 (Fig. S3). Note that in Fig. S3(a), we only show
the 6 K result, whereas in Fig. S4, we show all the data for 6 K, 16 K, 28 K, 40.5 K, 43
K, and 60 K. We summarize the values of |ΔR/R|max obtained in Fig. S3(b) (data are
offset). At all temperatures, |ΔR/R|max is proportional to the laser fluence, all with a
slope of 1 (Fig. S3(b)).

|ΔR/R|max obtained from (a) for various temperatures (offset for clarity). Dashed lines:
fitting curves with a slope of 1. Gray vertical line: laser fluence used to obtain the QP
dynamics data in Fig. 1 and 2 in the main text.
The fluence-dependent ultrafast dynamics that we measure (Fig. S3(a)) is also
crucial in verifying that the laser pulse fluence used (21 µJ/cm2 for pump beam) for our
temperature-dependent experiment fulfills the weak detection condition criterion (A).
The results in Fig. S3(b) also demonstrate that for the dynamic range of fluence, from
4.2 to 70 µJ/cm2, the density of the photo-excited QPs is proportional to the pump
fluence without saturation. Thus, the pump fluence we use (21 µJ/cm2) to obtain the
data in Figs. 1 and 2 in the main text is appropriate, without breaking the SC condensed
state, or introducing extra thermal effects [8].

3.2 Less thermal effect with lower laser repetition rate
Different laser repetition rate affects the thermal effect dramatically. We compare our
data with reported results (Fig. S5): it can be seen that, under the same single-pulse
fluence, the thermal effect is much more prominent for higher repetition rate

experiments (Fig. S6). With repetition rate increasing (from ① to ④), the ΔR/R
saturation becomes more prominent, their corresponding saturation thresholds are >70
μJ/cm2, 10 μJ/cm2, 4.5 μJ/cm2, and 0.8 μJ/cm2, respectively, which is summarized in
Fig. S6. It can be clearly seen that lower repetition rate allows for a much higher fluence
threshold.

3.3 Thermal effect in various experiments
We compare the fluence, heat capacity coefficient, and thermal effect among
different iron-based superconductors to further ensure that we are in the weak detection
regime. In Table S1 we list currently available parameters for iron-based
superconductors. The heat capacity coefficient κ for (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se is
extrapolated from the results in refs [11,12]. Clearly, the fluence in our experiment is
on the same order as those in other experiments. Although the fluence is roughly twice
of that of bulk FeSe, its heat capacity coefficient is much higher, resulting in a much
smaller thermal effect.
The excited-state QPs’ temperature can be obtained by (see Section 5)

𝑇𝑒 = 〈√𝑇𝐿2 +

2(1−𝑅)𝐹
𝜅𝑣 𝑙𝑠

𝑒 −𝑧/𝑙𝑠 〉,

(13)

where ls is the optical penetration depth, R is the reflectivity, 𝜅𝑣 = 𝜅𝜌𝑛 is the
electronic specific heat capacity coefficient for a unit volume (where κ is the electronic
specific heat capacity coefficient, and ρn is the mole density), TL is the lattice
temperature, and F is the pump fluence. The thermal effect is closely related to the value
of (1-R)F/κ, as listed in Table S1. It can be seen that the thermal effect in our
(Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se experiment is very small, compared with other reported
experiments. Furthermore, the thermal effect value for our (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se is
evidently very small. Thus, we conclude the fulfillment of the criterion (A) (i.e., no
thermal effect) for our experiment.
Significantly, our laser operates at a repetition rate of 250 kHz, which causes
considerably less accumulated thermal heating. In contrast, repetition rates of 1.6 MHz
and 5.2 MHz are used in refs [9] and [13], respectively.

4. WEAK DETECTION CONDITION: (B) NO PROMINENT DESTRUCTION
OF THE SC COMPONENT
4.1 No observation of sharp spike in the QP dynamics

For the weak detection criterion (B), an evidence for the occurrence of SC
depletion is the observation of a sharp spike nearby t = 0. In the below Fig. S7 [8], for
a cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ at a fluence Ф>70 μJ/cm2, a fast peak appears, which
“represents the signature of the SC gap collapse” [8]. Throughout our experiment, no
such fast spike has been observed. In Fig. S7, the fast spike has a width of 200 fs. As a
comparison, our Fig. 1(a) and Figs. S1(e-h) show no such a narrow spike and no such
shape a scanning trace. Thus there is no evidence of SC saturation. This is also
consistent with the fact that we use a fluence much less than 70 μJ/cm2, at which the
spike starts to appear [8].

different pump fluences. (b) Zoom-in view of panel (a) in the -0.5 – 2.2 ps range. (c-e)

maximum of the slow peak.
4.2 Estimation of the fraction of SC electrons that is photo-excited.
To further verify the fulfillment of the weak detection condition criterion (B), we

estimate the fraction of electrons in the SC ground state that are photo-excited and
become QPs under laser pulse incidence. Absorbed photons promote the SC groundstate electrons to the excited states, thus breaking the Cooper pairs. However, such
electrons only constitute a small portion of the overall SC electrons. We estimate the
fraction of such electrons within the sample as follows. Given the pump fluence F = 21
μJ/cm2 and the reflectivity R = 0.31 (see the discussions in section 5.2), the effective
pump fluence is (1 - R)F. After passing through one penetration depth for absorption ls
= 25 nm (see the discussions in section 5.1), the pump fluence reduces to 1/e times of
(1 - R)F. The absorbed portion of the pump fluence is thus (1 - 1/e) (1 - R)F. Denoting
the effective cross-section area of the laser spot in the sample by S, the absorbed light
energy is (1 - 1/e)(1 - R)FS, which occurs within a volume of lsS. Each photon generates
a pair of QPs; thus, we determine the density of photo-excited QPs within a unit volume
to be
𝜌𝑄𝑃 = 2(1 − 1/𝑒)(1 − 𝑅)𝐹𝑆/(ℏ𝜔𝑙𝑠 𝑆) = 3 × 1025 𝑚−3 .

(14)

Moreover, the fraction of electrons promoted to the excited state is given as
𝐹𝑄𝑃 = (𝜌𝑄𝑃 × 𝑉𝑈𝐶 )/𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 = 3.9 × 10−3 /𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙,

(15)

where VUC is the volume of the unit cell and we have taken the lattice parameters a, b,
and c to be 3.7827, 3.7827 and 9.3184 Å [17], respectively. This result clearly shows
that only 0.39% of the SC electrons per unit cell are excited by our pump pulses. Hence
the SC ground state remains unchanged during the ultrafast dynamics investigation. We
conclude that our experiment fulfills very well the weak detection condition criterion
(B).

5.

TEMPERATURE OF PHOTO-EXCITED ELECTRONS Te
Immediately after the pump pulse excitation, the temperature of the photo-excited

electrons Te can be increased to as high as 103 K in a solid, with the lattice temperature
TL still remaining at the ambient temperature. Along the light propagation direction z,
the energy density 𝐹(𝑧) experiences a simple exponential decay due to absorption:
𝐹(𝑧) = 𝐹0 𝑒 −𝑧/𝑙𝑠 ,

(16)

where z is the depth away from the sample surface, ls is the penetration depth, and 𝐹0 =
(1 − 𝑅)𝐹 is the energy density right at the surface. Thus, the energy transfer per
volume from photons to electrons at position z is 𝑄(𝑧) = −

𝑑𝐹(𝑧)
𝑑𝑧

= (1/𝑙𝑠 )𝐹0 𝑒 −𝑧/𝑙𝑠 .

The initial electron temperature is equal to the lattice temperature Tground state = TL. Given
the linear dependence of electron heat capacity Ce on electron temperature Telectron, Ce
= κvTelectron, we have
𝑇

𝑄(𝑧) = ∫𝑇 𝑒 𝐶𝑒 𝑑𝑇𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑛 = ∫𝑇 𝑒 𝜅𝑣 𝑇𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑛 𝑑𝑇𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑛 = (1/2)𝜅𝑣 (𝑇𝑒2 − 𝑇𝐿2 ), (17)
where 𝜅𝑣 = 𝜅 × 𝜌𝑛 is the specific heat capacity coefficient per unit volume, with κ
being the heat capacity coefficient and ρn being the mole density. Thus, we obtain
𝑇𝑒 (𝑧) = √𝑇𝐿2 +

2(1−𝑅)𝐹
𝜅𝑣 𝑙𝑠

(18)

As Te is a function of depth z, we consider the average Te within one penetration depth;
thus, we have the expression
𝑇𝑒 = 〈√𝑇𝐿2 +

5.1 Penetration depth ls
The penetration depth of some iron-based superconductors has been reported. It
is 26 nm for Ba1-xKxFe2As2 [9] and 24-26 nm for bulk FeSe [13,18]. These two different

types of iron-based superconductors have similar penetration depth. Because
(Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se is an intercalated superconductor, which has similar lattice and
electronic properties with those of bulk FeSe, we estimate its penetration depth to be
similar to those of bulk FeSe and Ba1-xKxFe2As2. As such, we take ls = 25 nm.
5.2 Reflectivity R
Measuring the reflectivity R of our sample is very challenging because the rough
sample surface causes the light to diffuse in all directions, preventing the collection of
the total reflected beam. We grow thin film (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se samples and
measure its reflection at low temperatures by using 800 nm femtosecond laser pulses.
The transmission of the cryostat window is taken into account. We obtain that R = 0.31.
5.3 Electron temperature Te
To obtain the electron temperature Te by Eq. (19), we use a high laser fluence F,
2.2 mJ/cm2, and calculate Te at a lattice temperature of TL = 7 K. We have estimated
that κ = 100 mJ·mol-1 ·K-2 (Table S1) and ls = 25 nm. Because in Eq. (19) TL2 <<
2(1−𝑅)𝐹
𝜅𝑣 𝑙𝑠

(20)

With TL = 7 K, we obtain Te = 548.5 K. Equation (20) can be plotted in Fig. S8. It can
be seen that TL does not affect Te very much. At low temperature Te is nearly a constant.

6. DECONVOLUTION OF THE QP DYNAMICS
For time-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy experiments, the detected dynamics
signal is indeed the convolution between the QP dynamics and the excited-state
accumulation response to the laser pulses. This convolution behavior occurs very often.
If not correctly de-convoluted, it can lead to fake QP lifetimes in the data analysis.
The detected signal can be expressed as


S  t   D  t   M  t    D   M  t    d ,


(21)

where S(t) is the detected dynamics signal, D(t) = H(t)·Afastexp(-t/τfast) is the fast
component of the QP dynamics, H(t) is the unit step function, Afast is the amplitude of
the fast component, τfast is the lifetime of the fast component, and M(t) = M0·exp(-t2/τM2)
is the excited state QP accumulation response to the laser pulse excitation. Although a
generalization to include all relaxation components can be implemented, it is mainly
the fast relaxation component that is considered here in the deconvolution, because the

slow component only slightly convolutes with the response function.
We discuss the response function M(t). Upon light excitation, Cooper pairs are
broken to generate QPs, which experience an accumulation process. At time zero, the
QPs and HFPs are n(t = 0) and N(t = 0). When the pair-breaking rate ηN is larger than
the QP recombination rate βn2, the QP density gradually increases even though the laser
pulse has already left (see Eq. (2)) [19]. Thus, the temporal width of the response is
larger than the laser pulse duration. We note that not all the accumulation process
contributes to the convolution with the QP dynamics. What affects the convolution is
the close-to Gaussian response function, which is contained within the accumulation
process and cannot be further “reduced”. We use a half-Gaussian function to fit the
rising accumulation process. Because these accumulated QPs have an identical effect
as an ultrafast light pulse, we then extend the response function to a full Gaussian
function by adding it rear half (Fig. S9, dashed red curves). Thus we obtain a Gaussian
like response function M(t) (Fig. S9). It is this Gaussian response (not the pulse width)
that convolutes with the QP dynamics. We note that the effect of the pulse duration is
already contained in the response function. As examples, we de-convolute the dynamics
for the three FeSe-based superconductors below.
Figure S5 shows the deconvolution for the QP dynamics of single-layer
FeSe/SrTiO3 (5 K, replot from ref. [14]), (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se (7 K, this work), and
bulk FeSe (4.4 K, replot from ref. [20]), respectively. Ultrafast laser pulses with
temporal durations of 96 fs, 70 fs, and 100 fs are used. In Fig. S9, the QP accumulation
Gaussian response function has a temporal width of 490 fs, 125 fs, and 1.30 ps,

respectively. In Figs. S9(a-c), the blue curves are the QPs dynamics D(t), the red curves
are response functions M(t), and the black curves are the convolution results S(t). The
S(t) fits well the experimental data. With such we obtain the fast component lifetimes
and ultimately the EPC constants for the three materials (see Fig. S9). We obtain the
lifetimes of the fast components as 0.23 ps for single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3, 0.34 ps for
(Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se, and 2.04 ps for bulk FeSe. Furthermore, we estimate the EPC
strength λA1g to be 0.48 [14], 0.22, and 0.14, respectively.

COHERENT PHONONS

We generate and detect coherent phonons in (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se. Because of
the multi-crystalline nature of the sample with huge surface light diffusion, the laser
fluences used to probe the QP dynamics are too weak to detect the coherent phonons
with enough signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, we increase the pump and probe fluences to
2.2 and 0.28 mJ/cm2, respectively. Figure 3a in the main text shows a typical ultrafast
dynamics response at 7 K. The periodic oscillations are superimposed on the QP
relaxation dynamics, in a manner similar to that observed in other quantum materials
[14,21,22]. The frequency of the extracted coherent phonon is 5.11 THz (i.e., 21.2 meV
or 171 cm-1, see inset in Fig. 3(a)), which can be fitted by a damped cosine function
with an initial phase of 0. Thus, the coherent phonon is generated by the displacive
excitation of coherent phonons (DECP) mechanism [23]. We assign the phonon to be
the A1g mode of Se atoms (as usual, only the A1 mode can be excited in DECP
mechanism). The amplitude decreases gradually with increasing temperature (Fig. 3(c)),
exhibiting a common anharmonic phonon decay [24]. In contrast, the frequency
remains nearly constant with increasing temperature (Fig. 3(d)), demonstrating that no
apparent structural phase transition occurs. The insets of Figs. 3(c) and (d) show the
magnified view for the 100-180 K temperature range; the temperature dependence in
this range is the same as that in the other temperature ranges. No structural transition
occurs in this temperature range, which verifies that the carrier density enhancement
observed at approximately 120 K in ref. [17] is of electronic rather than lattice origin.
Figure 3e shows the phonon lifetime directly measured in the ultrafast spectroscopy
experiment, with its temperature dependence. The inset shows the decay rate ΓΩ of the

coherent A1g phonon, which is fitted by ΓΩ (𝑇) = Γ0 + Γ (1 + 2𝑛Ω/2 (𝑇)) [24,25] (red
curve), where Ω is the phonon frequency, and 𝑛Ω/2 (𝑇) = [exp(ℏΩ/2𝑘𝐵 𝑇) − 1]−1 is
the phonon occupation density. We attribute the phonon decay to the anharmonic
phonon interactions.

8. OBTAINING THE EPC STRENGTH λ
In the main text, we stated that λ can be obtained by the QP relaxation model [26]
under high laser fluence excitation. This way of obtaining λ can be applied to various
materials, ranging from metals to superconductors. In this model, the QP relaxation rate
is determined by
𝛾𝑇 = (3ℏ𝜆〈Ω2 〉/𝜋𝑘𝐵 𝑇𝑒 ) (1 −

ℏ2 〈Ω4 〉
2𝑇 𝑇 )
(12〈Ω2 〉𝑘𝐵
𝑒 𝐿

+ ⋯ ),

(22)

where Ω is the phonon frequency, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and Te is the electron
temperature after photo-excitation.
8.1 Thermal relaxation rate γT
The thermal relaxation rate γT reflects the energy transfer from electron to
phonons or any other types of elementary excitations, which occurs faster than that
associated with phonon-phonon scattering. Thus γT is related to the initial decay rate in
the ultrafast dynamics measurement. We plot the typical scanning traces at different
temperatures ranging from 7 K to 290 K in Fig. S10. These traces are obtained with
high laser fluence (see the main text for the reason). By focusing on the electronic decay
rather than the superimposed oscillations, the QP lifetime at 7 K (Fig. S10(a)) can be
obtained to be 0.34 ± 0.05 ps. Thus, γT = 1/τfast = 2.9 ± 0.5 ps-1. We also show the
temperature dependence of the QP lifetime in Fig. S10(b). It can be seen that τfast keeps

nearly unchanged in the whole temperature range. This result demonstrates that the
Allen model is valid in the whole temperature range for TL (i.e. the higher order terms
in Allen model can be neglected).
The requirement for both high temperatures for electron and phonon is due to the
intermediate mathematical derivation requirement for the Taylor expansion for N(Ω,TL)
and N(Ω,Te), respectively. However, this can be over-tight, because the final result of
the Allan model needs only [N(Ω,TL)-N(Ω,Te)]∝[TL-Te] and the higher terms can be
neglected when TeTL is relatively high—no requirement on Te and TL individually. As
discussed in our text (page 6), this is equivalent to “(Ephonon)2 ≤ Eexcited-state electron ∙
Eground-state electron”, which can be fulfilled when Te is much higher than the optical phonon
energy. The experimental results in Fig. S10(b) is an excellent verification and
illustration of this reasonable approximation.

FIG. S10. Temperature dependence of the QP dynamics at 2.2 mJ/cm2. (a) The scanning
trace of the QP dynamics at several typical temperatures. The steep increase in the
differential reflection ΔR/R immediately after laser pulse excitation can be used to

determine the thermal relaxation rate γT. The oscillations superimposed on the
exponential QP dynamics correspond to the coherent phonon. The blue short-dashed
curves are the single-exponential fitting curves for the electronic ultrafast dynamics
(fast component). (b) The temperature dependence of QP lifetime.
A more precise way to obtain the γT is through the two-temperature model (TTM)
described by the thermodynamics differential equations [26,27]. The exponential fitting
method we use here yields equivalently accurate results, as shown in Fig. S11. In
deriving the TTM differential result, we analyze the difference results for delay times.
Upon approaching time zero, this yields an ideal value of γT, which compares
excellently with the exponential fit result. This is mainly because the exponential
function can fit our time-resolved experimental data very well.

(c) Fluence dependence of τfast derived from (b). The dashed curve is an extension of
the solid fitting curve (see text of SM).
We also did the fluence dependence experiment and the result is shown in Fig. S12.

In Fig. S12(a) we show the normalized dynamics results, each of which contains two
components (a fast one and a slow one). To see the fast component clearly, we re-plot
a zoom-in view of the short-time region of Fig. S12(a) in Fig. S12(b). It can be seen
that the fast component decays slower at higher fluences. Quantitatively, in Fig. S12(c)
we summarize the lifetimes τfast as a function of fluence, which can be well fitted by a

(see Ref. [26]). As shown in Fig. S12(c), the estimated τfast does

vary as a function of fluence, demonstrating that λ is a constant in the high-fluence
regime.
8.2 The EPC strength λ
Given all the parameters above, we can now obtain the EPC strength λ under the
condition of low lattice temperature and high laser fluence. We emphasize in the main
text that the higher terms in Eq. (16) can be neglected when (Ephonon)2 ≤ Eexcited-state
electron

∙ Eground-state electron (i.e., the energy of the excited-state electron is much higher than

that of the phonon). Note that λ is a constant, which is a fundamental property that does
not rely on laser fluence and persists up to a temperature much higher than the SC Tc.
As a deduction, γT is expected to be smaller at higher Te, which has been verified in
Ba(Fe0.92Co0.08)2As2 [28]. As stated in the main text, we mainly consider the A1g mode
phonon, whose frequency is 5.11 THz (i.e., 21.2 meV or 171 cm-1). By Eq. (22), we
obtain that λA1g = 0.22 ±0.04, which is plotted in Fig. 4 of the main text.
9.

THE Tc AND NOMINAL λA1g VALUES SHOWN IN FIG. 4
In our experiment, we measure the quantity 〈𝜆Ω2 〉. In Allen-Dynes’ treatment,

the logarithmic average phonon frequency Ωlog is used (“with a prefactor altered from
ΘD/1.45 to ωlog/1.2”) to make the McMillan equation “highly accurate” [abstract, ref.
29]. As a reasonable treatment, we assign 〈𝜆Ω2 〉 ≈ 〈𝜆Ω2log 〉 = 𝜆Ω2log . Consequently, a
natural and appropriate definition of the nominal λA1g is λA1g = λ(Ω2log /Ω2A1𝑔 ), as given
in the main text (page 8).
As shown in Fig. 4 of the main text, all categories of FeSe- and FeAs-based
superconductors are considered (mostly nearly optimized materials). Here, we
explicitly list their Tc and λ values in Table S2, along with the corresponding references.

A few important notes and explanations for obtaining the values in Table S2 are

given below.
9.1 Obtaining the experimental values of λA1g shown in Fig. 4
The Tc values of the single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 samples [14,43] are lowered by
their protecting FeTe layers or their removal. Thus indeed the Tc values could be slightly
higher. Thus the error bars shown in Fig. 4 are only nominal error bars for the two
results. The λ value of BaFe1.85Co0.15As2 in ref. [37] are not directly given by the authors
of ref. [37]; we extract the ultrafast dynamics result from ref. [37], perform
deconvolution, obtain the QP decay lifetime, and calculate the λA1g to be 0.125 (using
the A1g phonon frequency value given in ref. [37]). Note that both [37] and our
treatment here of the reported data share an identical method of obtaining λA1g as in
ultrafast optical spectroscopy; hence we classify [37] into the ultrafast experiment
category in Fig. 4. The lateral error bar for the bulk FeSe is given not by the authors of
ref. [13]; we extract the ultrafast dynamics result from ref. [13], perform deconvolution,
obtain the QP decay lifetime to be 2.04 ps, and derive the λA1g to be 0.14, which we set
to be the lower limit of the data fluctuation. It is worthy to note that the SC properties
are very much sensitive to the sample-to-sample fluctuation for bulk FeSe. The sphere
in golden color is a result not obtained by using the A1g phonon frequency. All the other
data points are obtained by using the A1g phonon frequency.
Furthermore, we performed to additional experiments on two iron-based
superconductors, respectively. We grow two nearly optimized samples: Fe1.05Te0.8Se0.2
(Tc = 10 K) and Fe1.01Te0.8Se0.2 (Tc = 13.5 K). The pump fluence is 16 μJ/cm2, which is
nearly identical to that in ref. [20], where the photon energy is 1.55 eV for pump and

probe beam. We measure the dynamics at 10 K in the time delay range of -0.5 – 110 ps,
as shown in Fig. S13. The fast component with a few hundreds of femtosecond lifetime
is clearly detected on both two samples. For Fe1.05Te0.8Se0.2, the fast component lifetime
is 0.31 ± 0.05 ps, and for Fe1.01Te0.8Se0.2 the fast component lifetime is 0.27 ± 0.05 ps.
By using Allen model and comparing with ref. [20], we identify the λA1g value of
Fe1.05Te0.8Se0.2 and Fe1.01Te0.8Se0.2 to be 0.11 ± 0.03 and 0.13 ±0.03, respectively.

9.2 Retrieving the theoretical values of λA1g shown in Fig. 4
In Fig. 4 of the main text, the λA1g values of LiFeAs [33], NaFeAs [33],
CaFe1.85Co0.15As2 [36], KxFe2Se2 [41], Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 [42], and FeSe0.5Te0.5 [34]
superconductors were not reported by their authors, but are retrieved from the
references by us. In these references, the theoretical λ values are calculated based on
the Eliashberg function using the logarithmic average phonon frequency Ωlog (Table
S3). The average phonon frequency Ωlog and the A1g phonon frequency ΩA1g were also
reported (Table S3). Given that λ ∝ 1/<Ω2> [44], to the first order of approximation,
we retrieve the values of λA1g by using λA1g = λ(Ωlog2/ΩA1g2).
For LiFeAs and NaFeAs, their Ωlog values have not been reported. We estimate
it by the following way. We illustrate the ΩA1g vs Ωlog of Fe-based superconductors in
below Fig. S14. It can be seen that the ΩA1g and Ωlog values have a positive correlation
(the yellow stripe). We assume that LiFeAs and NaFeAs also obey this correlation.
From the plot, we can obtain the Ωlog of LiFeAs is (120 ±15 cm-1) and that of NaFeAs
is 100 ± 15 cm-1. Thus the corresponding λA1g values are obtained to be 0.12 and 0.1,
respectively.

Thus, we obtain the values of λA1g (Table S3). We summarize these retrieval
processes in Fig. 4, where the original reported λ values are marked by light gray
squares or spheres, and white dashed arrows point from the reported λ values to the
retrieved λA1g values. These retrieved theoretical λA1g values and the reported
experimental λA1g values together form a whole set of data shown in Fig. 4, which fall
within the range of the purple stripe (centered on the pink curve, indicating a positive
correlation). We emphasize that all the cited theoretical works use the same definition
of λ following Allen, and the experimental data all rely on the ultrafast dynamics
described by the Allen model (except [43]).
The pink curve is a modified Allen-Dynes formula, where λ is replaced by 6.5λA1g,
and Ωlog by 1.5ΩA1g:

To the first order of approximation, we specify an average value of ΩA1g for the
various materials. We choose 176 cm-1 (i.e., 254 K), where in Fig. 4 the smallest value
is 163 cm-1 (for NaFeAs) and the largest is 189 cm-1 (for CaFe1.85Co0.15As2).
The orange curve is another modified Allen-Dynes formula, with λ replaced by

10. AFFECTING THE EPC THROUGH MODIFING THE ELECTRONIC
STATES, PHONONS, OR BOTH
Our results suggest that all iron-based superconductors have the same SC
mechanism, as reflected in Fig. 4. These data include almost all types of bulk iron-based
superconductors, including the ones we are measuring now. This surprising result in
Fig. 4 suggests a correlation between EPC and superconductivity for iron-based
superconductors. The physical picture might be like this (Fig. S15): the EPC plays a
crucial role in the SC pairing, while various other types of excitations, interactions or
modifications may affect either the electrons or the phonons or both; as a result, the
superconducting properties are largely affected.
