Abstract: Exotic decays of top partners in new bosons are the norm in realistic models
of a composite Higgs. We focus on the custodial charge-5/3 partner, which normally
decays exclusively into tW + . The new channels include a colour-sextet, X5/3 → b̄π6 , as
well as singly and doubly charged scalars, X5/3 → tφ+ , bφ++ . We use existing same-sign
lepton searches to show that the new final states are constrained at the same level as the
standard one. At the same time, exotic final states also offer opportunities for improvement:
examples include a hard photon in X5/3 → tφ+ → tW + γ decays, and top-rich channels
which arise in several exotic X5/3 decays.

Introduction

Vector-like quarks (VLQs) commonly emerge as top partners in composite Higgs models
where the top acquires a mass via a linear mixing in the partial compositeness mechanism [1]. The VLQs are thus fermionic bound states transforming as multiplets of the
underlying global symmetry that is spontaneously broken in order to generate a composite
Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). Being composites, they couple directly to the pNGB Higgs and they communicate the electroweak symmetry breaking to
the elementary top fields. The electroweak group SU (2)L × U (1)Y is a gauged subgroup of
the unbroken global symmetry group, such that the top partner multiplets can be classified in terms of their electroweak quantum numbers. A top partner X5/3 with charge +5/3
always occurs as part of an SU (2)L × SU (2)R bi-doublet in models that preserve custodial
symmetry [2, 3]. This situation can also occur in models with extra dimensions (see, e.g.,
Ref. [4]) and in models where VLQ multiplets are added via renormalisable couplings (see,
e.g., Refs [5–7]).

–1–

Searches for X5/3 constitute an important part of the ATLAS [8, 9] and CMS [10]
search programs. The exotically charged state is pair-produced via its QCD interactions
and is usually assumed to decay into tW + [11, 12], which is the only 2-body decay into
Standard Model (SM) particles allowed by its quantum numbers. Decays into lighter
flavours, namely cW + or uW + , are also possible [13–16] and lead to weaker constraints by
searches for light quark partners [17, 18]. Furthermore, X5/3 can also be singly produced
through its interaction with tW + , and this channel has been extensively studied both
experimentally [9, 19] and phenomenologically [20–24]. In this work we focus on QCD pair
production, which has the benefit of model-independence as the cross-section only depends
on the VLQ mass. However, other decays of X5/3 are possible, especially if the model
contains non-SM states that are lighter than the X5/3 . A classification of the possible final
states has been first attempted in Ref. [25]. In realistic models of a composite Higgs based
on gauge-fermion underlying interactions [26], such lighter states always occur in the form
of additional pNGBs beyond the Higgs multiplet [27–29]. In Ref. [30] a first survey of
exotic top partner decays that commonly occur in underlying models has been presented.
These include the following new decay channels for X5/3 :
1. Decay to a coloured pNGB π6 with charge 4/3: X5/3 → b̄π6 → b̄tt.
The colour-sextet π6 emerges in models with an SU (6)/SO(6) breaking pattern in
the QCD sector. 1 It decays exclusively into two same-sign tops [28].
2. Decay to electroweakly charged pNGBs: X5/3 → tφ+ and X5/3 → bφ++ .
Singly and doubly charged scalars are present, for instance, in models with breaking patterns SU (5)/SO(5) [29, 31] and SU (6)/SO(6) [32] in the electroweak sector. They emerge as a bi-triplet of SU (2)L × SU (2)R , i.e. a charged and a neutral
SU (2)L triplet. 2 The 9 degrees of freedom can be classified in terms of the diagonal SU (2) preserved by the Higgs [31], and they form a custodial quintuplet
+ 0 − −−
5 = (φ++
5 , φ5 , φ5 , φ5 , φ5 ) that contains both doubly- and singly-charged scalars, a
0 −
custodial triplet 3 = (φ+
3 , φ3 , φ3 ) that contains a second singly-charged scalar, and a
singlet. Following the analysis in Ref. [29], we identify the following decay patterns
for the charged pNGBs:
(a1 ) φ++ → W + W + ,

(a2 ) φ++ → W + φ+ ,

(a3 ) φ+ → W + γ + W + Z ,

coming from gauge interactions and the WZW topological term;
(b1 ) φ+ → tb̄ ,

(b2 ) φ+ → τ + ν ,

In the models of Ref. [26], QCD charges are sequestered to a second species of underlying fermions that
transform under a different representation than that of the Higgs constituents. There exist 3 classes of symmetry patterns: SU (6)/SO(6) containing a neutral colour octet and a charge-4/3 (or −2/3) sextet pNGB,
SU (6)/Sp(6) containing a neutral colour octet and a charge-2/3 triplet, and SU (3)2 /SU (3) containing only
a neutral octet [27].
2
Singly-charged pNGBs also arise in the symmetry patterns SU (4)2 /SU (4) [33] and SU (6)/Sp(6) [34, 35],
both of which enjoying underlying gauge-fermion descriptions.

generated by lepton violating interactions (∆L = 2), that may be related to neutrino
mass generation. 4 Typically, as the couplings are of very different origins, we would
expect one set of decays to dominate over the others, barring tuned values of the
parameters.
Coloured or electroweakly charged pNGBs add a plethora of new decay channels for
X5/3 , which differ in the number of tops, taus and on-shell W bosons. However, unless
specific tags for t, τ or W are explicitly added in the search, the resulting final states
share many similarities, as summarised in Table 1. The similarity becomes even more
clear when writing the decay products after t → bW + and τ + → W +∗ ν̄ decays, where
W ∗ denotes an off-shell W boson. All final states contain at least one b-jet as well as
two same-sign W bosons, either on- or off-shell. Existing X5/3 searches focus on two
complementary strategies: either they tag same-sign leptons (SSL) [9, 10] originating from
+
a fully leptonic decay chain X5/3 → tlep Wlep
, or they require a single lepton plus jets
+
+
(SLj) [8, 10] thus targeting the semi-leptonic decay chain X5/3 → tlep Whad
or thad Wlep
.
Assuming Br(X5/3 → tW + ) = 1, the current bound on the mass MX5/3 from the SSL
channel is slightly weaker than that from the SLj channel. More concretely, according to
the latest results at 35.9 fb−1 [10], the observed lower limit for the SSL and SLj channels are
1.16 TeV and 1.30 TeV respectively, for a right-handed X̄5/3 − t − W + coupling. However,
3

We consider couplings to 3rd generation because the couplings are typically proportional to the fermion
masses. For the same reason, we would expect the coupling to top-bottom to dominate over the coupling
to leptons.
4
Conservatively, we allow such couplings to be sizeable.

–3–

the expected (i.e. Monte Carlo) bounds are rather similar for those two channels: 1.19 TeV
for the SSL and 1.23 TeV for SLj, implying that the two channels have almost the same
sensitivity to the X5/3 X̄5/3 → tW + t̄W − final state.
Both search strategies apply to the exotic X5/3 decays, however the kinematics and the
particle multiplicities are modified. The SSL channel has a few advantages compared to the
SLj one: it has very low SM background and searches impose few specialised cuts beyond
demanding high-pT same-sign leptons (and two or more jets). We thus expect the SSL
searches to be more sensitive to most of the exotic decay modes. In this work, we study how
the bounds on the X5/3 mass are modified in presence of the new decay channels, which are
theoretically motivated by realistic composite Higgs models. Furthermore, we will identify
new requirements that can be added to current searches to significantly improve the reach
in some specific cases. The latter is a great opportunity to improve the performance of the
LHC searches in view of the high-luminosity phase that will start in a few years.
The article is structured as follows: In Section 2 we provide simplified models featuring
the decays X5/3 → b̄π6 → b̄tt, X5/3 → tφ+ and X5/3 → bφ++ , and the subsequent decays
of the scalars, motivated by the underlying models of Ref. [30]. In Section 3, we recast the
X5/3 search in the SSL channel [10], determine the bounds that apply if exotic X5/3 decays
are present, and provide projections for the exclusion reach of the high-luminosity LHC run
(HL-LHC). The recast search can also be applied to multi top final states, as arising from
the decays of charge-2/3 top partners via a singlet (pseudo-)scalar, T → ta → ttt̄ as well as
T → ta → tW + W − , and we show the results in Appendix A. In Section 4, we investigate
the opportunities for probing the exotic decays of X5/3 , such as adding a new hard photon
requirement that can improve the reach on the decay X5/3 → tφ+ → tW + γ in the SSL
plus photon channel, due to very low SM backgrounds. In addition, the collinearity of the
SSLs and the number of jets/b-jets are also useful to distinguish exotic decays from the
standard one. We conclude in Section 5.

Simplified Models

2.1

X5/3 → b̄π6 → b̄tt

As a first example, we consider exotic decays of X5/3 in the presence of a colour-sextet
pseudo-scalar, which for example occurs in underlying models of top partial compositeness
with SU (6)/SO(6) breaking in the colour sector [28]. In this case, the sextet π6 emerges
as a pNGB and is a singlet of SU (2)L with charge 4/3.
The effective Lagrangian for the X5/3 couplings, including the sextet, reads [28, 30]

where the superscript “c”, as in bc , denotes the charge conjugate of the field. For the
sake of generality, we allow both chirality structures for the couplings of X5/3 with the
sextet, however in composite Higgs models it is the coupling with a left-handed bottom

–4–

that dominates. This coupling is in fact related to the degree of compositeness of the
left-handed doublet (which contains also the left-handed top), which is required to be of
order 1 to generate a large enough top mass. On the other hand, the coupling to the
right-handed bottom is suppressed by the small compositeness of the bottom, thus being
smaller by a factor of mb /mt than the other chirality coupling. In addition to this, in
models within the classification of Ref. [26] the X5/3 belongs to a SU (2)L doublet while
the π6 is a singlet, thus the right-handed coupling is suppressed by an additional factor of
v/f  1 with respect to the left-handed coupling (v is the electroweak scale while f is the
decay constant of the pNGBs). The latter suppression can, however, be changed in other
models where the composite states belong to a different multiplet of SU (2)L : for instance,
if the π6 belonged to an SU (2)L doublet, the v/f factor would appear in the left-handed
coupling, thus it could balance the mb /mt suppression. The same case would occur if X5/3
were a singlet. For simplicity, however, in the following we will only consider couplings
to the left-handed bottom. Regarding the coupling to the tW + , it is always generated by
a mixing proportional to v, thus the dominant chirality will only depend on the SU (2)L
representation the X5/3 belongs to: right-handed top for a doublet and left-handed top for
a singlet.
The X5/3 branching ratios depend on the size of the effective couplings κX
π6 ,L/R and
X
κW,L/R as well as the mass ratios MX5/3 : Mπ6 : mW . In underlying models, various
branching ratios can be realized, including dominance of X5/3 → tW + , dominance of
X5/3 → b̄π6 , and comparable branching fractions [28]. For the phenomenological study
performed in this article, we thus treat the branching fraction as a free parameter.
The effective Lagrangian for the π6 couplings to SM particles is [28, 30]

with an SU (2) singlet π6 , the coupling κπtt,L

and the sextet decays as π6 → tt, with large dominance to right-handed tops [28].
2.2

X5/3 → tφ+ and X5/3 → bφ++

As a second example, we consider exotic decays of X5/3 in the presence of electroweakly
charged pNGBs, which for example are present in underlying models with SU (5)/SO(5)
breaking in the electroweak sector [29].
The effective Lagrangian for the VLQ X5/3 and the charged scalar couplings reads [30]

for the singly-charged scalar. In underlying models, the interactions in the first line result
from anomalous couplings of the bound state φ+ to the standard model gauge bosons, and
the anomaly coefficients are determined by the SM quantum numbers of the electroweakly
charged constituent fermions of φ+ [31]. Note that the φ+ → W + φ0 chain decay is typically
subdominant compared to the WZW induced decays [29]. The structure of the WZW
couplings derives from the fact that φ+ transforms as a SU (2)L triplet, thus there exists
an unsuppressed φ+ − W − − B coupling (B being the hypercharge gauge boson), which
results in
Br(φ+ → W + γ) : Br(φ+ → W + Z) = cos2 θW : sin2 θW ≈ 80% : 20%,

(2.5)

when Mφ+  mW . The couplings of φ+ to SM fermions in the second line of Eq. (2.4)
typically arise out of the mechanism generating SM fermion masses, thus explaining the
proportionality to the quark and lepton masses. Note that contrary to the WZW couplings,
the couplings to fermions may vanish for some choices of the VLQ representations entering
the partial compositeness sector [29]. Furthermore, such couplings, if present, typically
dominate over the WZW couplings, the former being generated at tree level while the
latter are loop suppressed. We can thus identify three distinct scenarios:
1. Couplings to fermions vanish, thus the decays into a pair of gauge bosons dominate,
φ+ → W + γ + W + Z;
2. The coupling to 3rd generation quarks is present, thus the dominant decay is φ+ → tb̄
(left-handed bottom);
3. The coupling to quarks vanish while only the coupling to leptons is present, thus the
dominant decay is φ+ → τ + ν.
For the phenomenology, therefore, we will only consider these 3 cases. Note that in principle
we could add a coupling to the left-handed tau, however this would imply the presence of
a right-handed neutrino and the coupling would be very small because it is proportional
to the neutrino masses.

where the only allowed coupling mediating decays comes from the WZW interactions.
As φ++ is a member of a charged triplet, this coupling must necessarily be suppressed

–6–

by powers of the Higgs scale, namely v 2 /f 2 , thus it is very small. This leaves open the
possibility of sizeable chain decays φ++ → W + φ+ arising from the gauge interaction term
Lφ++ ⊃ gκφW φ (φ− ∂ µ φ++ − ∂ µ φ− φ++ )Wµ− .

(2.7)

Due to the suppression in the WZW coupling, the chain decay may dominate even if the
two charged scalars are very close in mass (as they belong to the same multiplet) and the
W is off-shell [29]. Even though in the SU (5)/SO(5) model there are two singly-charged
states, it turns out that, in realistic configurations, their masses are always very close.
There is another scenario that leads to interesting phenomenology if the model contains
sources of lepton number violation, which generate the following ∆L = 2 couplings:

L ⊃ iκ̃φντ,L ν¯c φ+ PL τ + h.c. + iκ̃φττ,L τ¯c φ++ PL τ + L ↔ R + h.c. ,
where the coupling to right-handed taus are suppressed by v 2 /f 2 . These terms may be
related to Majorana neutrino mass generation, thus being very small, however here we
will be pragmatic and allow them to dominate. They add an interesting leptonic decay
channel for the doubly-charged scalar, while the decay of the singly-charged scalar would
be indistinguishable from the one in Eq. (2.4).

The different decay channels of φ++ and φ+ imply a large number of possible final
states from X5/3 decays which are summarised in Table 2, together with the relevant
couplings and particle masses. For completeness, we also include the decays from the
scenario described in Sec. 2.1.

Bounds: same-sign leptons

In this section we extract bounds on various decay modes of QCD pair produced X5/3 . We
focus on the SSL final state, which is common to all decay modes, and recast the CMS
search of Ref. [10], which currently provides the strongest bound on the standard X5/3

–7–

decay among the existing SSL searches [9, 10]. The recast and its validation are described
in Sec. 3.1, while in the following Sections 3.2 - 3.4 we determine the signal efficiencies for
the final states deriving from the new decay modes of X5/3 . We determine bounds on the
mass of X5/3 assuming that both of the pair-produced X5/3 decay in the same way.
As we will see, all exclusive decay modes have very similar efficiencies, thus we expect
that events with mixed decay modes also have similar efficiencies. This is mainly due to
the fact that the SSL pair is present in all final states, and the only difference is in the
kinematics of the SM particles in the final state. The SSL final state is also relevant for
other decays that are rich in tops, like for instance the 6-top final state deriving from the
decays of a charge-2/3 top partner via a neutral (pseudo-)scalar, T → ta → ttt̄ [30]. This
final state has been already studied in Refs [36, 37], and as a by-product of our study we
applied our recast search to this channel and find the strongest bound on the T mass of
1.3 TeV (details are shown in Appendix A).
3.1

Recast of the CMS SSL search

We write the Lagrangians described in Section 2 in model files using the FeynRules package [38] to implement them in MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [39] which is used to generate the
parton-level signal events. Generated events are matched to +1 jet final state and then interfaced to Pythia 8 [40] and Delphes [41] for parton shower and fast detector simulation,
respectively. The events are generated at LO accuracy in QCD, however, with the help
of the Top++2.0 package [42–47], we normalise the pp → X5/3 X̄5/3 cross-section with the
QCD next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) one with next-to-next-to-leading logarithm
(NNLL) soft-gluon resummation.
We then implement a cut-flow that mimics the search strategy of Ref. [10], namely
events are required to have:
1. At least two SSLs with the leading one p`T > 40 GeV and the sub-leading one
p`T > 30 GeV. The invariant mass of the SSL pair is required to be larger than 20 GeV
to veto quarkonium resonances. For the purpose of suppressing the Z → `+ `− background, events containing a pair of opposite-sign and same-flavour leptons whose
invariant mass is within 15 GeV of the Z boson mass are rejected. For the events
with two or more electrons, the veto applies to the e± e± pair as well, to suppress
backgrounds from charge-misidentified electrons.
2. At least two AK4 jets with pjT > 30 GeV and |η j | < 2.4. The AK4 jets are reconstructed by the anti-kt algorithm with a cone size ∆R = 0.4.
3. We require a minimum number of constituents Nconst > 5, where Nconst = Nj +N` −2
with Nj and N` being the number of AK4 jets and charged leptons, respectively.
4. HT > 1.2 TeV, where HT is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed objects.
For the background, we take the expected (i.e. Monte Carlo) numbers given in the CMS
study Ref. [10], which are 10.9 ± 1.9 events with a same-sign di-electron, 11.2 ± 2.0 with
di-muons and 23.2 ± 3.7 with an electron-muon pair.

Figure 1. Expected bound on the QCD X5/3 pair production cross-section from our recast (dashed)
compared to the CMS results [10] (solid) for left-handed (left) and right-handed (right) couplings.
In red we show the X5/3 pair production cross section at NNLO-NNLL.

To validate our recast, we generate events with pair production of X5/3 with subsequent
decay X5/3 → tW both via a right-handed and a left-handed coupling, and compare the
bound on the cross section we obtain with the official CMS one, as shown in Fig. 1.
The results feature an excellent agreement with the experimental results. In the limit
Br(X5/3 → tR W ) = 100%, the measured (expected) SSL limit on MX5/3 is 1.16 TeV
(1.19 TeV) according to CMS [10]. To obtain a naive estimate for the HL-LHC reach
with a luminosity of 3 ab−1 at 13 TeV, we rescale signal and background event numbers
according to the increased luminosity and assume an improvement of the sensitivity by a

factor S/ B. This procedure yields a projected exclusion reach of MX5/3 = 1.56 TeV. We
will use the same procedure to extract projected sensitivities for the exotic decays in the
next sections.

Bounds for X5/3 → b̄π6 → b̄tt

Let us start with the model described in Section 2.1 where the X5/3 VLQ is accompanied
by a colour-sextet scalar π6 with charge 4/3, which decays to a pair of same-sign tops,
π6 → tt. If the sextet is lighter than the X5/3 , the two kinematically allowed decays of
the VLQ within this model are the standard decay, X5/3 → tW + , and the exotic decay,
X5/3 → b̄π6 → b̄tt. Both decay chains yield a SSL final state with the same probability,

(3.1)

such that differences in acceptance result solely from different cut-efficiencies. In the following we will consider only the chirality structure of the couplings that derives from realistic

–9–

composite models, i.e. X5/3 decays dominantly into a right-handed top (plus W + ) and a
right-handed anti-bottom (via π6 ), while the sextet decays into right-handed tops.
We determine the analogous limits for the case Br(X5/3 → b̄π6 ) = 100%, i.e. in the
case in which both of the pair-produced X5/3 decay through the colour-sextet. The signal
efficiency is a function of MX5/3 and Mπ6 . As compared to X5/3 → tW + , X5/3 → b̄tt yields
more b jets in the final state. The SSLs result from leptonic decays of the π6 → tt and tend
to be softer and have a smaller angular separation for lighter π6 . However, the SSL analysis
[10] is a cut-and-count analysis with low background. The cuts are conservative, and the
modified kinematics only weakly affect the signal efficiency. Fig. 2 shows the resulting
limit (blue solid line) and the projected HL-LHC exclusion reach (blue dashed line). The
limits for X5/3 → b̄π6 → b̄tt weakly depend on Mπ6 and are comparable to the limits for
X5/3 → tW + (green solid and dashed lines).

and projections for the HL-LHC reach (dashed lines) for the exotic decay X5/3 → b̄π6 (blue) and
the QCD pair produced sextets (red). The bounds and projections for the standard Br(X5/3 →
tW + ) = 1 decay are shown for reference in green. The horizontal red lines show the bound from
the direct QCD pair production of the sextets derived from the same SSL search [10]. The bounds
become insensitive to Mπ6 for light masses above threshold.

The SSL search we recast can also be used to constrain the direct pair production of
the sextet via QCD, thus providing a bound on Mπ6 directly [28]. The π6 decays to tt (and
π6∗ → t̄t̄), in fact, also yield same-sign W ’s from the top decays. We thus use our recast of
the search in Ref. [10] to obtain a bound of Mπ6 > 1.24 TeV and an exclusion projection of
Mπ6 > 1.62 TeV for HL-LHC. These results are based on a LO simulation, with production
cross section normalised at LO. This result, shown by the red horizontal lines in Fig. 2,
implies that the bounds from direct production of π6 are stronger than those from the X5/3
decays.

Figure 3. Bounds on the MX5/3 –Mφ+ plane from the CMS SSL search of Ref. [10] (solid lines) and
projections for the HL-LHC reach (dashed lines) for the various φ+ decay modes (blue-red-purple).
The black dotted line indicates MX5/3 = Mφ+ + mt , above which the decay X5/3 → tφ+ becomes
kinematically unaccessible. The bounds and projections for the standard Br(X5/3 → tW + ) = 1
decay are shown for reference in green lines. The bounds become insensitive to Mφ+ for light masses
above threshold.

Next, we discuss the bounds from SSL searches on X5/3 pair production if X5/3 decays
through singly-charged scalars. This model is described in Section 2.2. The singly-charged
scalar φ+ has several possible decay modes, where typically one dominates over the others:
a) X5/3 → tφ+ → bW + (W + γ + W + Z),
b) X5/3 → tφ+ → ttb̄ → bbb̄W + W + ,
c) X5/3 → tφ+ → bW + τ + ν/ν̄.
All final states yield similar SSL rates from the leptonic decays of the W , except for the
leptonic tau decays in case c) that occur at a higher rate. As in the previous case, the
main differences originate from the kinematics of the events: for instance, the leptons
from the tau decay are expected to be softer because of the presence of an additional
neutrino. In the case a), the γ/Z are predicted to be roughly 80%/20% due to the fact
that Br(φ+ → W + γ)/Br(φ+ → W + Z) ≈ 1/ tan2 θW ' 4 when Mφ+  mW,Z .
We simulated the new channels assuming 100% branching ratio into each, and taking
the chiral couplings predicted in the composite Higgs models. Fig. 3 shows the resulting
limits (solid) and the projected HL-LHC exclusion reaches (dashed). As it can be seen, the
bounds are comparable to those obtained for the standard decay X5/3 → tW + . Constraints
and projections for the decay X5/3 → tφ+ → tτ + ν are slightly weaker, in particular for
heavy φ+ . This is because the leptons from τ decays are softer. Overall, as can be seen, the

– 11 –

cuts applied in the SSL search are rather insensitive to the detailed kinematics. Thus, no
large modifications of the bounds are expected even in case X5/3 and X̄5/3 decay through
different channels.
It is instructive to check kinematic distributions in order to determine whether and
how the different X5/3 decays could be distinguished if an excess is found in future searches.
The most striking feature is present in the X5/3 → tφ+ → tW + γ decay channel, where the
SSL is accompanied by a hard photon. We study this channel in more detail in Section 4.
3.4

Bounds for X5/3 → bφ++

The model described in Section 2.2 also contains a doubly charged scalar φ++ , that allows
for the X5/3 → bφ++ decay. The doubly charged φ++ has several possible decays, with
usually one of them dominating over the others:
a) X5/3 → bφ++ → bW + W + ,
b) X5/3 → bφ++ → bτ + τ + ,
c) X5/3 → bφ++ → bW +(∗) φ+ ,
where the latter contains a virtual W + and several possible decays of the φ+ . As before, all
decay modes offer SSLs in the final state. There are two important features distinguishing
this case form the previous ones: the bτ + τ + decay offers higher leptonic rates compared
to the W ’s in the final state, without loosing too much hardness of the leptons; in the
chain decay, one of the leptons needs to come from the virtual W , thus being typically
very soft due to the small mass splitting between the two charged scalars. Furthermore,
the bW + W + final state tends to have harder SSL pairs and larger HT , thus it more easily
passes the selection cuts.
The results of our recast of the SSL search are shown in Fig. 4, where we present the
direct decays of φ++ in the left panel and the chain decay via φ+ in the right one. As
expected, the bounds for the direct decays are significantly stronger, with the highest gain
in the τ + τ + channel. In the case of the chain decay, the bounds depend significantly on the
mass split between the two charged scalars, which is expected to be small in the underlying
models as they both come from the same custodial multiplet. Following Ref. [29], we expect
the mass difference to be a few tens of GeV, and in the simulation we fix Mφ++ − Mφ+ =
30 GeV. The results from Fig. 4 thus show that the bounds on the masses are weaker
than for the standard decay and for other decays of the charged scalars. As we already
mentioned, this is due to the softness of the lepton coming from the virtual W in φ++ →
`+ νφ+ . We should recall, however, that this final state will be covered by the SLj search
that, as we mention, has similar expected reach as the SSL one we implemented.

Opportunities: optimising specific channels

As showed in the previous section, the SSL search for X5/3 pair production applies very
well to the motivated exotic X5/3 decays, with comparable signal efficiency. Kinematic distributions of exotic X5/3 decays, however, differ and can in principle be used to distinguish

the signals if an excess is found, or optimise the cut-flow for specific cases. One signature
which stands out is the X5/3 → tW + γ decay through φ+ that yields an additional hard
photon. 5 In this section we will provide a brief characterisation of the opportunities these
kinematical features may offer for future searches.
4.1

X5/3 → tφ+ → tW + γ: A hard photon final state

For decays of the singly-charged scalar via the WZW coupling, there is a high probability
(roughly 80%) of having a hard photon in the final state. Demanding a hard photon in
addition to the SSL cut-flow strongly reduces the background while merely affecting the
signal efficiency, thus it may be an efficient tool to further probe this decay mode. The
photon in the final state can also be very effective to search for φ+ in direct Drell-Yan
production, as suggested for the Georgi-Machacek model in Ref. [48]. It should be noted
that in the composite case this is relevant irrespective of the mass of the scalar, while in
the elementary Georgi-Machacek model only for masses below the W Z threshold.
Estimating the backgrounds for a SSL + hard photon search is, however, hard and
beyond the scope of this work. The main reason is that we expect new sources of backgrounds deriving from instrumental misidentification of jets into photons, that can only
be estimated reliably by data-driven methods. While we expect such backgrounds (and
their systematic uncertainties) to be small, they may be potentially relevant for the HLLHC study. Other SM backgrounds, however, can be easily estimated. In Ref. [10], the
5

The same applies to the cascade decay X5/3 → bφ++ → bW +(∗) φ+ → bW +(∗) W + γ.

– 13 –

dominant backgrounds come from SM processes (tt̄ + X and multi-boson final states) and
same-sign non-prompt background (in which a non-prompt lepton, i.e. a lepton from a
heavy-flavour decay, photon conversion, or a misidentified jet, passes the tight lepton identification requirements), while misidentified opposite sign prompt lepton background (in
which one lepton charge is misidentified) is present but less important. Overall, about 45
background events are expected (divided as 10.9 ± 1.9, 11.2 ± 2.0 and 23.2 ± 3.7 events in
the ee, µµ and eµ channels) for a luminosity of L = 35.9 fb−1 . Adding a radiated hard
photon would bring down the rates by a factor αem times a loop factor, thus we expect a
background suppression of 10−3 ÷ 10−4 roughly. This would leave a background free search
at current luminosity, and very few background events at HL-LHC. As already mentioned,
this very naive estimate suffers from the presence of additional instrumental backgrounds
that can only be estimated using data-driven techniques.

Figure 5. Left: Distribution of the transverse momentum of the leading photon in signal events
which pass all SSL cuts, for MX5/3 = 1.4 TeV and three reference masses of Mφ+ = 0.4, 0.8, and
1.2 TeV. Right: Contours in the MX5/3 − Mφ+ plane at which 10 signal events are expected with
the cut-flow described in this subsection. Blue, red, and purple lines correspond to a Br(X5/3 →
tφ+ ) = 10%, 50%, 100%. Solid lines assume 35.9 fb−1 while dashed lines assume 3 ab−1 . The
bounds and projections for the standard Br(X5/3 → tW + ) = 1 decay are shown for reference in
green lines.

For the reasons above, we do not attempt to estimate discovery/exclusion reaches, but
we will only indicate the level of signal events that may be achieved. The search strategy
is to use the same SSL cut-flow from Ref. [10], which has been outlined in detail in Section
3.1, and require an additional high-pT photon. As an illustration, in the left panel of Fig. 5
we show the pγT distributions of signal events passing all SSL cuts prior to the pγT cut,
where we fixed MX5/3 = 1.4 TeV and chose three reference masses of Mφ+ = 0.4, 0.8, and
1.2 TeV. As expected, the photon spectrum becomes harder for heavier φ+ masses, however
we can see that even light scalars tend to produce high-pT photons due to the large mass

– 14 –

of the X5/3 mother particle. We thus decided to impose a cut
pγT > 200 GeV ,

(4.1)

as a reference value, which could be optimised in a more realistic search definition that
included backgrounds. With this choice, the majority of the signal events passes the cut
while, as we argued before, the backgrounds should be greatly reduced. In the right panel
of Fig. 5 we show, in the MX5/3 − Mφ+ plane, contours at which 10 events pass the SSL +
photon selection cuts for the luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 from Ref. [10] (solid) and for the HLLHC one (dashed). We probed 3 different values of the Br(X5/3 → tφ+ ) = 10%, 50% and
100%, with the remaining decays into the standard one Br(X5/3 → tW + ) = 1 − Br(X5/3 →
tφ+ ) (we recall that φ+ → W + γ(80%) + W + Z(20%)). As a reference the green vertical
lines show the current and projected reaches of the SSL search: while the two sets of
curves cannot be directly compared as they correspond to very different quantities, the
plot illustrates the fact that adding the requirement of a hard photon cut may improve the
reach at HL-LHC, even for small branching ratios in the exotic X5/3 → tφ+ channel. As we
already stressed, while 10 events is a generous requirement at low luminosity, where zero
background events are expected, only a dedicated experimental study can really establish
the potential reach at HL-LHC.
As a final remark, we would recommend that any search sensitive to X5/3 pair and
single production, like Refs [8–10], could publish the pT –distribution of the hardest photon
as a first probe. The observation of an anomaly, c.f. Fig. 5, would then be a hint that this
exotic decay may be hidden in the background.

pair production. The distributions are obtained after the SSL search cuts (see Section 3.1).

– 15 –

Several channels of the exotic X5/3 decays yield more tops in the final state than the
standard decay. It is well known that such final states are efficiently detected by SSL
searches [36], as our results in the previous section also confirm. Upon decays of the tops,
the final state results very rich in b-jets and has enhanced hadronic activity. The same holds
true for the π6 QCD pair production, for which we applied the SSL search in Section 3.2.
Thus, it may be useful to explore the b-jet and light-jet multiplicities to distinguish the
exotic channels from the standard one. To this end, we show these distributions in Fig. 6
for
• X5/3 pair production and the “standard” decay X5/3 → tW + ,
• X5/3 pair production and the charged cascade decay X5/3 → tφ+ → ttb̄,
• X5/3 pair production and the “coloured” decay X5/3 → b̄π6 → b̄tt, and
• π6 pair production with π6 → tt.
For the b-tagging, following Ref. [9], we choose an efficiency of 77%, with mis-tag rates of
1/134 (1/6) for light jets (c-jets), implemented in the analysis by modifying the Delphes
card. The distributions show events which pass all SSL cuts as outlined in Section 3.1. We
fixed the masses of the new states to MX5/3 = 1.4 TeV, Mφ+ = 1.2 TeV, and Mπ6 = 1.2 TeV,
however the distributions only weakly depend on the masses. The jets and b-jets result
from (cascade) decays of fairly heavy particles such that they are very likely to overcome
basic energy or pT cuts. A mild dependence is introduced as hadronically decaying tops
or W bosons are increasingly boosted for higher masses, leading to an increasing rate of
merged jets or b-jets.
As expected, the plots show that the exotic signals feature more b-tagged jets and
hadronic activity than the standard signal. Besides a discriminator, this feature could be
used in the HL-LHC data to increase the level of background rejection against these new
signals.
4.3

Modified kinematics of the SSL pair

The exotic X5/3 decays alter the kinematics of the final state, which in particular affects
the SSL kinematic distributions. In this section, we focus on two channels that have the
most striking effects: X5/3 → bφ++ → bW + W + and X5/3 → bφ++ → bτ + τ + . We show the
distribution, for exclusive decays, in Fig. 7, compared to the standard decay X5/3 → tW + .
As we are considering QCD pair production, the majority of the top partners will be
produced at rest and do not have a significant momentum. For the standard decay, the top
and W + will therefore be produced back-to-back and with a sizeable boost. This implies
that the SSL pair, where one lepton comes from the top and the other from the W , also
tends to be back-to-back, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 7. On the other hand, for
the decays via the doubly-charged scalar φ++ , the SSL pair comes from a single boosted
resonance, and thus tends to be more collinear. This effect is more pronounced for light
scalars: in the figure, we show two sets of distributions for fixed MX5/3 = 1.4 TeV and two
choices of Mφ++ = 800 GeV and Mφ++ = 400 GeV. The plot clearly shows that increasing

the scalar mass makes the signal more similar to the tW + case, while a net distinction is
exhibited for small masses.
We also see a marked effect in the invariant mass distribution of the SSL pair. For light
++
φ , the scalar will receive a momentum of roughly pφ++ ≈ (MX5/3 − Mφ++ )/2. In the
case of φ++ → τ + τ + → `+ `+ + 4ν’s, we can roughly expect that this momentum will be
equally subdivided between the 6 particles in the final state, so that the expected invariant
mass should be around M`± `± ≈ (MX5/3 − Mφ++ )/6, as it can be seen in Fig. 7, right panel,
for Mφ++ = 400 GeV. A larger invariant mass can be expected for the φ++ → W + W +
channel due to the presence of fewer neutrinos in the final state. For the standard decay,
due to the large angular separation, we expect and see a broader distribution, with larger
invariant masses being populated.
These results show that the angular separation and invariant mass can be good discriminants in the case of decays via the doubly charged scalar, in particular for light masses
compared to the top partner one.

Conclusions

In realistic models of a composite Higgs boson, the top partners have more available decays
than the standard ones in a pair of SM particles, which have been considered so far. We
have focused our attention on the decays of the custodial charge 5/3 partner X5/3 , which
has only one possible decay into a SM final state, X5/3 → tW + . The new channels always
involve at least a pair of same-sign tops or W bosons, which lead to the SSL signature
already searched for in the standard decay mode for pair produced X5/3 .
After recasting the search in Ref. [10], we showed that all the final states have similar
efficiencies, thus leading to very similar bounds on the mass of the X5/3 , irrespective of

– 17 –

the precise branching ratios. The only exception is due to chain decays through a doublycharged and a singly-charged scalar, with the two charged scalars being close in mass,
which however will be covered by the single-lepton searches.
While the new channels are already constrained, their final states, richer than the
standard one, also offer opportunities for improvements of the current strategies. Such improvements may be crucial at the HL-LHC phase. In particular, we identified one decay via
the singly-charged scalar which contains high-pT photons, X5/3 → tφ+ → tW + γ. Adding
a high-pT photon requirement to the standard SSL search may be able to consistently increase the reach at the LHC, even though a data-driven background estimation is needed
for a precise determination. The new channels also offer final states rich in tops, which
therefore feature many b-tagged jets and increased hadronic activity, while some channels
feature peculiar angular distribution of the SSL pair that may allow to distinguish them
from the standard decays.
In conclusion, we showed that the new exotic decay channels, which are the norm
in realistic models, while being already efficiently covered, offer new opportunities for
improvement for HL-LHC searches of the custodial X5/3 top partner.

Bounds on an exotic decay of a top partner with charge 2/3
T2/3 → ta → ttt̄

In the main article we focussed on exotic decays of charge 5/3 partners. However, as is well
known, SSL searches yield strong bounds on more generic multi-top final states [36]. In
particular, this statement holds for charge 2/3 top partners, T2/3 , that can decay to 3 tops,
ttt̄, via a bosonic mediator [30]. This case has already been considered via vectors [36] and
scalars [37], but with older data. Thus, as a byproduct of our X5/3 study, we will apply
our recast search to this final state.
We will consider the following effective Lagrangian [30] (implemented as described in
Section 3.1)

on the spin and CP-properties of the mediator.

model with κB = −κW . The bounds and projections for X5/3 pair-production with Br(X5/3 →

The bounds from our recast of the SSL search of Ref. [10] are shown in the left panel of
Fig. 8, where the solid blue line corresponds to the current luminosity and the dashed one
is the HL-LHC projection. For reference, we also show the bounds on X5/3 pair-production
with Br(X5/3 → tW + ) = 1. The bounds and projected bounds on T2/3 → ttt̄ are stronger
than those of X5/3 → tW + because the branching fraction for a 3t3t̄ to SSL is larger.
Our recast, yielding bounds MT2/3 . 1.3 TeV are stronger than the ones in Ref. [37] as
the authors only consider Run-II LHC searches at lower luminosity [49, 50]. Nevertheless,
the projections for HL-LHC are substantially weaker than those of the dedicated search
suggested in Ref. [37], which is tailored to the 6 top final state.

A.2

T2/3 → ta → tW + W −

SSL searches also yield bounds on the decay T2/3 → ta → tW + W − , which can occur in
models in which a decays via electroweak interactions.
We will consider the following effective Lagrangian [30] (implemented as described in

where fa denotes the pseudo-scalar decay constant and cW is the Weinberg angle. In
underlying models where a is realized as a pNGB bound state of electroweakly charged
fermions, the couplings to gauge bosons can be determined in terms of two parameters:
one coupling, κaW , to the SU (2) bosons and one, κaB to hypercharge, and couplings are
related by
κaγ = κaW + κaB , κaZ = κaW + κaB t4W , κaZγ = κaW − κaB t2W ,
(A.3)
while the coupling constant to W + W − is κaW . Thus, within underlying models, the decay
a → W + W − implies the presence of decays into neutral gauge bosons. In the following we
use as a benchmark κB = −κW . This coupling structure is for example realized for a pNGB
in underlying composite Higgs models with SU (4)/Sp(4) breaking in the electroweak sector.
In this benchmark point, the coupling of a to γγ vanishes, while the branching fractions
to W W : ZZ : Zγ are 0.65 : 0.16 : 0.19 (up to phase-space factors, i.e. in the limit
Ma  2mZ ).
The bounds from our recast of the SSL search of Ref. [10] are shown in the right
panel of Fig. 8, where the solid blue line corresponds to the current luminosity and the
dashed one is the HL-LHC projection. As compared to the standard decay X5/3 → tW +
with Br(X5/3 → tW + ) = 1, the bounds are slightly enhanced. Although the Br(T2/3 →
tW + W − ) < 1 in the benchmark scenario, the final state contains one more W , which
enhances the probability to obtain same-sign leptons. The decays T2/3 → t(ZZ/Zγ/γγ)
provide additional promising exotic VLQ decay signatures (see Ref. [51]).
