Excited states in the 158 Eu nucleus have been determined with the 160 Gd(d,α)158 Eu reaction,
studied at an incident energy of 18.0 MeV with the Munich tandem and Q3D spectrograph. More
than 50 excited states have been determined up to 1.6 MeV excitation, some of them corresponding
to states previously observed in the β − -decay of 158 Sm. The number of levels found in this nucleus
at low excitation energies follows the systematic trend of the level densities in the other isotopes
with mass 152–156.

INTRODUCTION

The study of nuclear structure in rare earth nuclei with
a multitude of nuclear reactions has been rather intensive especially in the region near the neutron number
N = 90 where the nuclear properties undergo a rapid
change, pinpointing one of the best examples of quantum shape phase transition. While the even-even nuclei
and odd-mass nuclei are relatively well studied, the oddodd nuclei in this region are less investigated. One of
the possible study tools, making use of the many available stable targets in this region, is the (d,α) reaction.
When performed on even-even targets, it leads to oddodd nuclei, and the advantage is that the target has a
0+ ground-state, which facilitates the determination of
the spin and parity of the states in the odd-odd nucleus. Rather surprisingly, this powerful tool was practically unused in the rare earth nuclei. With the exception
of the reaction 152 Sm(d,α)150 Pm [and of two other reactions used for its energy calibration, 140 Ce(d,α)138 La and
142
Nd(d,α)140 Pr], which was used to determine the level
structure of the practically unknown 150 Pm nucleus [1],
this reaction was never performed on other targets in the
rare-earth region.
We decided to use this reaction in order to determine
the level structure of the 158 Eu odd-odd nucleus. For
this nucleus there are no adopted levels in the ENSDF
database [2], except for a ground state with a proposed
spin-parity (1− ) as expected from Nilsson configurations.
The ENSDF evaluation mentions, however, determinations of excited levels of 158 Eu in an unpublished study
of this nucleus by the β − -decay of 158 Sm, which were
also used in a publication where an analysis of the total
absorption γ-spectrum in the β-decay was performed [3].
The study of the (d,α) reaction on chains of even-even
targets, such as that of Nd, Sm, Gd, and Dy nuclei, would
be of considerable interest also because it may offer a
systematic view of the structure evolution of the oddodd nuclei, an aspect that will be exemplified at the end
of this work.

EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS

The experiment was performed at the Munich tandem
accelerator, using a deuteron beam of 18 MeV and a 0.5
µA average intensity. The target was 125 µg/cm2 Gd2 O3
98.2% enriched in 160 Gd on 10 µg/cm2 Carbon foil. Its
main impurities were 158 Gd, 157 Gd, and 156 Gd, each less
than 1%. The reaction products were analyzed in the
Q3D spectrograph [4] and detected and identified in its
focal plane detector, a multiwire proportional chamber
with readout of a cathode with microstrip foil structure
for ∆E − E particle identification and position determination [5].
Spectra were recorded at an angle of 10◦ relative to
the beam direction, with an acceptance of the spectrograph of 14.61 msr (21.8 × 24.5 mm2 ). Figure 1 displays
a ∆E − E plot for the reaction products that enter the
focal plane detector, showing the good separation of the
α-particles. The other events from this plot very likely
represent tritons, deuterons, and 3 He (from left to right),
although a sure identification is difficult due to the different reaction Q-values, extended range of energies of the
emergent particles, the rather compressed scale of the
rest energy axis, and the proximity to the threshold cutoff. With this identification of the alpha’s the spectra of
the (d, α) reaction were practically background-free. The
beam current was integrated into a Faraday cup placed
after the target in order to determine the cross sections.
Due to the small cross-sections of our reaction and the
available beam intensity and measurement time, angular
distributions could not be measured. We concentrated
on the measurement at just one angle, of 10◦ . Figure
2(a) shows the 10◦ spectrum measured during a total of
19 hours. The energy calibration of this spectrum has
been achieved by measuring, in the same conditions, the
spectrum of the 111 Cd(d,α)109 Ag reaction, with a target
of 150 µg/cm2 thickness, for which peaks corresponding
to well-known levels of 109 Ag [6] have been identified.
This calibration spectrum is shown in Fig. 2(b).
Both spectra in Fig. 2 have been processed with the
GASPAN peak fitting program [7]. The FWHM energy

resolution was about 15 keV for the spectrum in Fig. 2(a)
and 12 keV for that in Fig. 2(b), respectively. Peaks due
to the target impurities were not visible in the spectrum
of Fig. 2(a). For the calibration spectrum in Fig. 2(b),
an energy calibration curve for the excitation energy Ex
in 109 Ag versus channel number was generated as a second degree polynomial. From the peak energy labels in
Fig. 2(b) one can see that this curve describes the excitation energies known with good precision [6] with an accuracy of less than 1.5 keV. This calibration curve was then
transformed, by kinematics calculations, in a new calibration curve Eabs versus channel number, where Eabs
is the absolute energy of the α-particles (of the order of
27 MeV). This second calibration curve was used for the
spectrum in Fig. 2(a) in order to determine the absolute
α-particle energies of the peaks corresponding to states
in 158 Eu, which were then transformed into excitation
energies by using kinematic calculations. This procedure
was necessary in order to take into account the rather
different recoil energies of the residual nuclei in the two
reactions, due to the large mass difference between the
target nuclei.
Q-value of the 160 Gd(d,α)158 Eu reaction. A better
determination of this quantity resulted as a byproduct of the energy calibration described above. The Qvalue of the calibration reaction (on the 111 Cd target)
is rather well known, Q(d,α) (111 Cd) = 10178.0±1.3 keV,
as given in the 2016 mass table [8]. For the reaction
160
Gd(d,α)158 Eu the Q-value is given as Q(d,α) (160 Gd)
= 10024±10 keV [8]. By using the Q-value of the 111 Cd
target, our measurement of the energy of the peak corresponding to the ground state of 158 Eu (Fig. 2(a)) pro-

vided a value of Q(d,α) (160 Gd) = 10035.5±1.6 keV, which
is consistent with the older value but more precise.
Excited states of the 158 Eu nucleus. Table I shows the
energy levels found for 158 Eu in the present experiment,
In both Table I and Fig. 2 the errors given for the energy values are the statistical errors, as resulted from the
calibration curve and the errors in the peak centroids.
As one can see from Fig. 2, the calibration curve (second degree polynomial) deduced from the reaction on the
111
Cd target works well up to an excitation energy of 1.32
MeV, corresponding to an excitation energy in 158 Eu of
about 1.23 MeV. Beyond this excitation energy, up to
the highest excited state determined (about 1.6 MeV)
the energies given in the table are based on the extrapolation of the calibration curve. It is therefore expected
that with increasing energy this procedure may provide
increasing deviations from the (unknown) real energies,
that are larger than the specified statistical error. Also,
to better see the basis of the peak assignments, Fig. 3
shows details of the peak fitting with the GASPAN program. The peak shapes were fitted with a gaussian plus a
left side (lower α-particle energy) exponential tail which
is due to the energy loss of the alpha particles in the thin
target. A fixed tail fraction was chosen, which was found
by eliminating the tendency to fit the peaks as doublets,
and by a good description of the shape of strong, better
separated peaks. Figure 3 shows six panels corresponding to fits in the six adjacent regions of the total spectrum shown in Fig. 2(a). Some weaker fits, e.g., those
to the 95.5 keV and 228.6 keV peaks may be due to the
fact that their shape did not reach stability yet due to
the weak statistics. Attempts to fit the 228.6 keV peak

by a doublet failed, while for the 95.5 keV peak such
a procedure was not justified due to the low number of
counts. Tentative levels (shown within parentheses in Table I) correspond to rather small, less certain peaks found
through the peak decomposition procedure. Figure 3(e)
corresponds to the region between 1015 and 1175 keV
excitation, where there are states with significant overlap (average spacing comparable with the energy resolution). The peak decomposition from this region should
be considered with some caution. The number of states
found by GASPAN in this region depends somewhat on
the width allowed for the peaks; by imposing a FWHM
value comparable to that in the adjacent regions (with
better separated peaks) one finds a number of nine peaks
in this region, two of them being tentative (see Table I).
The other (stronger) peaks found in this region appear to
be relatively stable to reasonable variations allowed for
the widths of the peaks.
As a result of the analysis of the (d,α) spectrum of Fig.
2(a), a number of 58 excited states have been assigned
in the 158 Eu nucleus (five of these being tentative) up to

about 1.6 MeV excitation. In Table I they are compared
with the 27 excited states proposed from the β − -decay
of 158 Sm in the same energy range [2, 3]. Fourteen of
these states may coincide with states observed in the
β-decay experiment.
TABLE I: Energy levels of 158 Eu as observed in the present
(d,α) reaction experiment, compared to levels observed in the
β − -decay study of 158 Sm [2, 3]. When the energies of levels
from the two experiments differ by less than 3 keV, they are
placed on the same line and it is assumed that they may represent the same excited state. Levels tentatively proposed in
our experiment are given within parentheses (see also Fig. 3).
The groups labeled by (a), (b), ... , (f) correspond to the six
graphs in Fig. 3.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

As a result of the present experiment and of the unpublished β-decay study [2, 3] a large number of excited
states of 158 Eu have been determined up to about 1.5
MeV excitation (Table I). No spin and parity values were
assigned to any of these levels. In the β − decay of the 0+
ground state of 158 Sm the populated states are expected
to have spin values 0, 1, and 2h̄ and many of these were
populated in our reaction too. The spin window of the
states seen in the (d,α) reaction is wider, states up to
spin about 6 h̄ may be populated (see, e.g., Ref. [9]),
with higher spin states being favored due to the large
angular momentum mismatch of the reaction.
Although without spin and parity value assignments,
the knowledge available now on this odd-odd nucleus extends the nuclear structure systematics of the odd-odd
Eu isotope chain, and allows a new, stimulating view of
this interesting mass region.
It was recently shown that the nuclear level density can
be employed as a useful indicator of the critical shape
phase transitions (SPT) in nuclei [10]. The connection
between the evolution of the level density at low excitation energies and the phase transition phenomenon was
examined in detail in the rare earths region, where there
is the well known first order SPT that takes place around
the critical point N ≈ 90. This behavior is induced by
the variation of a non-thermal control parameter – the
number of neutrons N . The SPT manifests itself by a
rapid evolution of the ground-state equilibrium deformation around the critical point, which is reflected in discontinuous variations of different so-called effective order
parameters (such as the two-neutron binding energy, nuclear radii, etc.) as a function of N . The level density
was shown to display a maximum value at the critical
point [10], which is also consistent with the phenomenon
of phase coexistence in nuclei at, or close to, the critical
point.
The critical shape phase transitions were less studied
in the odd-odd nuclei. Experimental determinations of
the level density are rather scarce in such nuclei. In
particular, the only isotopic chain for which systematic
data exist is that of the Europium [10]. Experimental
level densities at low excitation energies were taken from

I). A residue spectrum with two standard deviations statistical limit is shown below each graph. The six graphs correspond to
the six groups of levels displayed in Table I.

Ref. [11], where the parameters of simple level density
models, such as the back-shifted Fermi gas (BSFG) or
the constant temperature (CT) models were determined
by fitting the experimental low-excitation complete level
schemes and the level density at the neutron binding energy. In the BSFG model,
the total level density is de√

citation energy, a and E1 are two empirical parameters
and σ is the spin cutoff parameter [11]. The parameter a
of the BSFG model may be taken as a measure of the level
density: for nuclei with comparable masses, the larger a,
the larger is the level density [10]. Figure 4 shows the evolution of the experimental a parameter known for three
odd-odd Eu isotopes: 156 Eu, 154 Eu, and 152 Eu. For these
three isotopes, the knowledge of the low-excitation level
scheme is considered complete within the following exci-

tation energy/spin windows: (0–0.39 MeV)/(0 – 5h̄) for
Eu, (0 – 0.49 MeV)/(1 – 5h̄) for 154 Eu, and (0 – 0.35
MeV)/(1 – 4h̄) for 152 Eu, respectively [11]. In Fig. 4 it
is seen that the experimental a has the largest value at
N = 89, near the critical point of the control parameter
N , and decreases with increasing N .

156

Since 158 Eu is far from the critical point of the phase
transition, we expect a relatively low level density in this
nucleus, compared to that of the isotopes of mass 152 to
156. In order to examine the available data from a larger
N region we adopt here a simplified procedure. For this,
we will directly compare the number of levels known in
these nuclei up to an excitation energy of 0.35 MeV. This
excitation energy range was chosen because it is common
to the three nuclei in which complete level schemes exist
(N = 89, 91, and 93). The number of states up to 0.35
MeV is 83, 60, and 24 for N = 89, 91, and 93, respectively

For N = 95 (158 Eu) we count a number of 13 levels up to 0.35 MeV excitation (Table I). Given the spin
values covered by the two experiments , it is likely that
this level scheme is well known up to this energy, close
to completeness (within the same spin range as that of
the three lighter isotopes). Actually, a few missing levels
would not significantly alter our conclusions. For N = 87
(150 Eu), we have a similar situation, with a number of
about 13 levels [12]. In Fig. 4 we represent also a rough
level density determined as the number of levels per MeV,

up to an excitation energy of 0.35 MeV), arbitrarily normalized such as its logarithm approximately scales as the
a parameter. This approximate low-energy level density
shows the same pattern as that of the experimental a
parameter. 158 Eu (at N = 95) continues the decreasing
trend of the level density with increasing N . On the other
side of N = 89, 150 Eu also displays a rather low value.
With the points added now at N = 87 and N = 95 one
can see that the low-energy level density of Eu odd-odd
nuclei displays a well defined maximum at N = 89.
In conclusion, a large number of excited states,
close to 60, have been determined up to about 1.5
MeV excitation for the odd-odd nucleus 158 Eu, from
a spectrum of the 160 Gd(d,α)158 Eu reaction measured
at 10◦ . Although the experiment was limited to this
measurement and could not provide spin/parity value
assignments, it allowed an examination of the low-energy
number of levels in the Eu isotopes with N from 87 to
95. The low-energy level density determined for 158 Eu
smoothly continues the decreasing trend of the lighter
isotopes.
Partial support for this work within the TE67/2018
project with the UEFISCDI Romanian research funding
Agency is aknowledged. The authors thank the technical staff of the Tandem accelerator for the good quality
beam. This was the last transfer reaction experiment
(of the Romanian authors) with the Q3D spectrograph
of the tandem accelerator laboratory in Garching – Munich, which will be closed at the end of 2019.
