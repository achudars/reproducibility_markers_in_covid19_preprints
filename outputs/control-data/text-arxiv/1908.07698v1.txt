Abstract
Weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction schemes are presented that
preserve cylindrical symmetry for radial flows on an equal-angle polar mesh. These new
WENO schemes are used with a Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (DG) hydrodynamic
method. The solution polynomials are reconstructed using the WENO schemes where the
DG solution is the central stencil. A suite of challenging test problems are calculated to
demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the new WENO schemes.
Keywords: Lagrangian shock hydrodynamics, Discontinuous Galerkin, Cell-centered
hydrodynamics, Symmetry-preserving WENO

1. Introduction
Lagrangian hydrodynamic methods, e.g., staggered-grid hydrodynamics (SGH) [2, 3, 4,
5, 6] and cell-centered hydrodynamics (CCH)[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], solve the governing
equations for gas (or solid) dynamics on a mesh that moves and deforms with the flow. DG
methods [15, 16, 17, 18] have been developed for Lagrangian hydrodynamics [19, 20, 21,
1, 22, 23, 24, 25]. For strong shock problems, both Barth-Jesperson limiter [26, 27] and
the WENO reconstruction method [28, 29, 30, 31] have been explored with Lagrangian DG
methods [20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 19]. However, the research on symmetry preserving WENO
reconstruction schemes is quite limited [32], and as such, it is the focus of this paper.
In [1], the modal DG method generates a system of equations to evolve the coefficients for
a Taylor series polynomial forward in time. The specific volume, velocity, and specific total
energy fields are approximated with Taylor series polynomials about the mass center of a
reference cell. The Lagrangian DG hydrodynamic method conserves mass, momentum, and
total energy. An explicit TVD Runge-Kutta (RK) method is employed for time marching.
In order to preserve cylindrical symmetry for radial flows on an equal-angle polar mesh, new
WENO schemes are presented that build the WENO reconstruction by either projecting
to a local orthonormal basis [33] or using a local characteristic decomposition [34]. These

WENO schemes are used with a Lagrangian DG method in this work where the DG solution
is used as a central stencil. These WENO schemes could also be used with finite volume
CCH methods where the central stencil is constructed by least squares fitting neighboring
cell average values.

where σ is the stress tensor. The pressure, specific internal energy and specific kinetic energy
are denoted as p, e, and k respectively. For gas dynamics, σ = −pI. The time derivatives

solving a Riemann problem [12] on the surface of the deformed cell w(t). The Riemann

Riemann solver for Lagrangian CCH has been explored extensively [9, 10, 12]. The volume
integral (the 2nd term on the rhs) is evaluated by Gauss quadrature formulas. An explicit
TVD RK method [16] is used to evolve the semi-discrete system of equations.
3. WENO limiting
The Lagrangian DG hydrodynamic method evolves polynomial coefficients forward in
time and these polynomial coefficients must be limited near shocks to ensure monotone
solutions. In this paper, these solution polynomials are reconstructed using two WENO
schemes where the DG solution is the central stencil. It is very important to preserve
cylindrical symmetry with WENO on an equal-angle polar mesh for 1D radial flows. To
preserve symmetry, two strategies are explored for creating a WENO reconstruction, which
are (1) a projection to a local orthonormal basis and (2) a local characteristic decomposition.
These strategies are denoted in this paper as strategy 1 and 2.
3.1. Projection to a local orthonormal basis
Step 1. We project the DG solution matrix U in the reference space (ξ −η) to the physical
space (x − y) for Up . Here U is the DG solution matrix, defined by,

Figure 2: The stencils associated with the cell w0 . r l and θ l denote the local orthonormal basis determined
by the local cell average velocity. n f represents the unit normal vector for the the face f surrounding the
cell w0 .

Likewise, the polynomial matrix in the physical space, Up , can be obtained.
Step 2. We construct the polynomials qpr from the selected stencils. For the cell w0 , shown
in Fig. 2, the following 5 stencils, {S0 : w0 }, {S1 : w0 , w7 , w8 , w1 }, {S2 : w0 , w1 , w2 , w3 },
{S3 : w0 , w3 , w4 , w5 }, and {S4 : w0 , w5 , w6 , w7 }, have been selected. Here, the polynomial
of the central stencil S0 is known, while the polynomials from other 4 biased stencils need
to be reconstructed. For every biased stencil, let’s assume the reconstructed polynomial is
∂q r
∂q r
qpr = q̄p (w0 ) + ∂xp (x − xcm (w0 )) + ∂yp (y − ycm (w0 )). Taking stencil S1 as an example, this
polynomial qpr satisfies the following,
R

ρqpr dw7 = m(w7 )q̄p (w7 ),

ρqpr dw8 = m(w8 )q̄p (w8 ) and ρqpr dw1 = m(w1 )q̄p (w1 ).

Then least squares can be used to calculate qp2

polynomial matrix Up for the biased stencils.
Step 3. We compute the smoothness indicator. The smoothness indicator depends on
the variable gradient, that is frame dependent and thus leads to rotational symmetry loss.
Step 3.1 Project the polynomial matrix Urp to a local orthonormal basis for Upl . For the
cell w0 , we define a local orthonormal basis using the local cell average velocity (u, v), namely
r l = √u21+v2 [u v]T and θ l = √u21+v2 [−v u]T , shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, a transformation

only depend on radius r, the

cylindrical symmetry is preserved.
Step 3.3 We compute the nonlinear weights ωi based on the smoothness indicator oi ,
ωi = Pω̄iω̄i , ω̄i =

ωli
(ε+oi )2

(10)

where ωli is a linear weight and ε = 10−6 to avoid division by zero. In this work, ωl0 = 0.5
and ωli for biased stencils is just arithmetic average of (1 − ωl0 ).
Step 3.4. We get the WENO reconstruction polynomial matrix in the local basis using

Upl = 4i=0 ωi Upli .
Step 3.5. We project the WENO reconstruction polynomial matrix Uw

Step 4. We Project the WENO-based polynomial matrix Uw
p in the physical space back
to the reference space for U using the inverse process of L2 projection defined in Eq. 5.
3.2. Local characteristic decomposition
Local characteristic decomposition is also applied. Step 1, 2 and 4 are same as that in
Section 3.1, while Step 3 is done by a local characteristic decomposition detailed as follows.
Step 3.1 We project the polynomial matrix Urp in the physical space to the characteristic
field for Uc . The Jacobian matrix of the integral governing equations (Eq. 1) is,

only depend on the radius, thus it preserves the cylindrical symmetry.

Step 3.3 and 3.4 are similar to the above section. The above 4 steps are executed four times
(4 faces) for creating the WENO reconstruction.

4. Test problems
In this section, a suite of challenging test problems are calculated to demonstrate the
accuracy and robustness of the WENO-based Lagrangian DG hydrodynamic method. The
test problems are the polar Sod [20], Sedov [35] and Noh [36], which all use a gamma-law
equation of state (EOS). Some important parameters are listed in Table 1. The initial
conditions (ρ0 , u0 , v 0 , p0 ) for polar Sod (left), Sedov (middle) and Noh (right) are given by,

The numerical results are shown in Fig. 3. For all test cases, the meshes in the first
quadrant are presented. The final meshes (Fig. 3a, 3d and 3g) move in a stable manner.
The density scatter plots (Fig. 3b, 3e and 3h) agree well with the exact solution. The
polar Sod problem is used to do the quantitative analysis of symmetry preserving. Velocity
deviations from the radial direction are used as a symmetry-preserving metric. From the
scatter plots for symmetry errors shown in Fig. 3c, our two strategies preserve symmetry
very well as demonstrated by the fact that the largest errors are on the order of 10−15
(machine precision), while the original WENO method cannot preserve symmetry. From
Fig. 3f, for Sedov, strategy 2 gives the smallest density scatter as expected. In addition,
the difference between the original WENO method and strategy 1 is very small because
the original method happens to preserve symmetry on an initially uniform square mesh for
this kind of symmetric explosion problem; the explanation is as follows. Taking the first
quadrant as an example, the test problem and the mesh are both symmetric about the 450
line so the smoothness indicators for the two symmetric cells about the 450 line are equal.
Likewise, a similar phenomenon can be observed for the Noh problem.
5. Conclusions
We presented new symmetry-preserving WENO limiters and used them with a Lagrangian DG hydrodynamic method to simulate shock driven flows in 2D Cartesian coordinates. The WENO reconstructions were calculated using two approaches (1) a projection
to a local orthonormal basis or (2) using a local characteristic decomposition to preserve
cylindrical symmetry on an equal-angle polar mesh for radial flows. The DG solution is used
as the central stencil for the WENO reconstructions in this work; however, these WENO
schemes could also be used with finite volume hydrodynamic methods where the central
stencil is constructed by least squares fitting neighboring cell average values. The symmetry
preservation of the new WENO schemes with the Lagrangian DG hydrodynamic method was
demonstrated by calculating the polar Sod problem. The canonical WENO method breaks
symmetry, while the new WENO schemes have errors on the order of machine precision.
The accuracy and robustness of the proposed WENO schemes was then demonstrated by
calculating the Sedov and Noh test problems. These new WENO schemes are a promising
approach for calculating limited reconstructions for use with finite volume and DG hydrodynamic methods.
