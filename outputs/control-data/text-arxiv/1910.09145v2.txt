Abstract. In this paper we show that the average size of the automorphism group over Fq of a smooth
degree d hypersurface in Pn
Fq is equal to 1 as d → ∞. We also discuss some consequence of this result for
the moduli space of smooth degree d hypersurfaces in Pn .

1. Introduction
Definition. Let Sn,d denote the set of smooth degree d hypersurfaces in PnFq .
The automorphism group of a projective smooth degree d hypersurface X, Aut(X), in PnFq over the
algebraic closure Fq has been an object of intense study over the past decades. It is known that for most (n, d),
i.e (n, d) 6= (2, 3), (3, 4) all of the automorphisms of the hypersurface X are induced by by an automorphism
PFn . This has been proven by Matsumura and Monsky in [MaMo] for n ≥ 2 and Chang in [Ch] for n = 1.
q
Another classical fact is that Aut(X) is finite for n ≥ 2, d ≥ 3. This was shown for n ≥ 3 by Matsumura
and Monsky in [MaMo]. For n = 2 and d ≥ 4, the genus of a smooth degree d curve is g = (d − 1)(d − 2)/2
is a least 2 so we can use an old result of Schmid [Sc]. Finally, the argument for d = 3 can be found in [Po3].
We also know that for (n, d) 6= (2, 3) there is a open subset Un,d of Sn,d such that Aut(X) = {1}; here
we include (n, d) = (3, 4) with the caveat that we are only considering linear automorphisms, i.e., induced
by automorphisms of Pn . This result can be found in work of Katz and Sarnak [KaSa, Lemma 11.8.5]. The
fact that Un,d is nonempty follows from work of [MaMo] for n ≥ 3, d ≥ 3, and this can be adapted to work
for the cases n ≥ 2, d ≥ 4. An alternative proof of the case n = 2 and d ≥ 4 can be found in [KaSa, Lemma
10.6.18].
For our purposes we are only going restrict to the set of automorphisms defined over the base field of the
hypersurface, Fq , and prove a quantitative version of the above.
Theorem 1. We have that

We also have an error term version of Theorem 1 that will be used in the last section on the moduli space
of smooth degree d hypersurfaces in Pn .

2. Proof of the main theorems
We will not write anymore explicitly the restriction (n, d) 6= (2, 3), (3, 4), but the reader should bear it in
mind for all the proofs. We start with the following result which appears in [Po1]:
Theorem 3 (Poonen). We have that

This implies that a positive X
proportion of hypersufaces are smooth once d is large enough compared to q.

Our estimates will not take into account the smoothness of the curves and rather prove a general bound.
This leads to introducing the following definition and notations and note that we have be careful about
scaling the matrix, since we will pick a representative for each element of PGLn+1 in GLn+1 .
Definition 4. Let Pd the vector space of homogenous polynomials of degree d in Fq [x1 , x2 , . . . , xn+1 ].
For an element A = (ai,j ) ∈ GLn+1 (Fq ) and λ ∈ Fq consider
P A,λ = {f ∈ Pd | λf = f ◦ A}
where f ◦A denotes the polynomial where the variables (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn+1 ) are changed to A(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn+1 )t .
It is easy to see that P A,λ is a linear subspace. The key to the proof is the following estimate

d−r+n
Note that the dimension of this vector subspace is
since obviously the degree of h must be d − r.



Then if dim(P r,xi ) + dim(P A,λ ) ≥
+ 1 then their intersection must be nonempty. Thus there is
n
a nonzero fi = xri hi (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn+1 ) such that we have

xri hi (x1 , . . . , xn+1 ) = (ai,1 x1 + ai,2 x2 + . . . + ai,n+1 xn+1 )r · (hi ◦ A).
Thus note that the valuation of xi on the right hand side must be at least r. For r > d/2 since hi 6= 0 we
have that the valuation of xi in h is at most d− r < r. Thus we must have xi |ai,1 x1 + ai,2 x2 + . . .+ ai,n+1 xn+1
so ai,k = 0 for k 6= i. We want to maximize the dimension of P r,xi to given an upper bound for dim(P A,λ )
so we choose r = ⌊d/2⌋ + 1.
This finishes the proof of the lemma.

Proof. Let λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λn+1 be the nonzero diagonal entries in the matrix A. Then by identifying coefficients
jn+1
on both sides of f = f ◦ A we have fj1 ,j2 ,...,jn+1 = 0 or λj11 λj22 . . . λn+1
= 1, where j1 + . . . + jn+1 = d .
A,λ
From this it follows that the dimension of P
is the number of tuples of indexes (j1 , . . . , jn+1 ) with the
jn+1
property that λj11 λj22 . . . λn+1
= 1 and j1 + . . . + jn+1 = d.

Note that we can rewrite this multiplicative relation as aj11 aj22 . . . ajnn = λdn+1 where ai =

n. The condition in the statement can be translated to not allowing all of the ai ’s to be 1.
We can assume wlog that a1 6= 1. This means a1 has order at least 2, so for a fixed tuple (j2 , . . . , jn )
d − (j2 + . . . + jn )
+ 1 values of j1 we can pick such that the stated
with j2 + . . . + jn ≤ d there are at most

3. Outlook on the moduli space of smooth hypersurfaces
The goal is to discuss some of the implications of theorem 2. First let us introduce some notation. Let
Hn,d be the moduli space of degree d hypersurfaces in Pn ; more precisely, the quotient Sn,d / PGLn+1 . It
is well known that it is a Deligne-Mumford stack over Spec(Z); see [Ben, Theorem 1.6]. We also have the
following fiber bundle
PGLn+1

Sn,d
Hn,d

which translates into the equality [PGLn+1 ] · [Hn,d ] = [Sn,d ] in the Grothendieck ring of stacks, K0 (St).
The set |Hn,d (Fq )| encodes the number isomorphism classes of smooth projective hypersurfaces of degree
d in Pn . We can pick one representative for each of the isomorphism classes and thus identify this with
|Hn,d (Fq )|. Note that we have a natural probability measure on this where for each hypersuface we weight
1
. This is well understood to be most natural way to count objects which have automorit by
| AutFq (X)|
X

phisms and we obviously get the equality |Hn,d (Fq )| =

| AutFq (X)|
representatives we’ve chosen.

|Sn,d |

+O(q C ( d )+(n+1) ), where C = 1− n .
Using theorem 2 we obtain the following: |Hn,d (Fq )| =
| Gln+1 (Fq )|
2
We can see this as an incarnation of the above equality in the Grothendieck ring of stacks, but this is neither
implied, or implies the equality in K0 (St).
We will use a special case of [BuKe, Theorem 1.2] which gives an error term for Bertini theorems over
finite fields.
Theorem 8 (Bucur-Kedlaya). We have that

where D =
− (n + 1)2 + 1 = dim(Hn,d ).

Let us make a few remarks about the above result. We can think about the above as being a stabilization
result for the point counts on the moduli space Hn,d , and it offers a different perspective on the stabilization
results proved in [VaWo]. We can also try to count the number of points on Hn,d using the Lefschetz
trace formula for Deligne Mumford Stacks proved by Behrend [Beh]. Tomassi [To] has proven that the
d+1
, thus stabilizing. We know that Hn,d has
singular cohomology of Hn,d vanishes in degrees 2 ≤ k ≤
2
a compactification such that the boundary is a normal crossings divisor with respect to Spec(Z), and thus
we can compare the etale cohomology and the singular cohomology and conclude that etale cohomology
vanishes also in these degrees. As far as we know there are no results proven about the unstable cohomology
Hn,d , so the above theorem cannot be simply deduced from this cohomological side.
∗
If we use the same heuristic as in [AcErKeMaZB] about the eigenvalues of Frob acting on Het
, we can
conjecture that there should not be too many unstable classes coming from algebraic cycles in each degree
close to the dimension 2D. It is well known that the eigenvalues of Frobenius attached to algebraic cycles are
integral powers of q. The classes that are not coming from algebraic cycles of weight close to the dimension
2D can either be: few in each weight so their contribution is small, or they can be modeled using a random
4

unitary matrix, and using a result of Diaconis and Shahshahani [DiSh] this matrix has bounded trace with
high probability. Thus we can heuristically think about the contribution of non-algebraic classes in the
Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula as being negligible as d → ∞.
