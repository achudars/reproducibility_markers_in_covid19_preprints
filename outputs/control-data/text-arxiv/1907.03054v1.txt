Probing gravity by holding atoms for 20 seconds

Atom interferometers are powerful tools for both measurements in fundamental physics and inertial sensing applications. Their performance, however, has been limited by the available interrogation
time of freely falling atoms in a gravitational field. We realize an unprecedented interrogation time
of 20 seconds by suspending the spatially-separated atomic wavepackets in a lattice formed by the
mode of an optical cavity. Unlike traditional atom interferometers, this approach allows potentials
to be measured by holding, rather than dropping, atoms. After seconds of hold time, gravitational
potential energy differences from as little as microns of vertical separation generate megaradians
of interferometer phase. This trapped geometry suppresses the phase sensitivity to vibrations by
3-4 orders of magnitude, overcoming the dominant noise source in atom-interferometric gravimeters. Finally, we study the wavefunction dynamics driven by gravitational potential gradients across
neighboring lattice sites.

Matter-wave interferometers with freely falling atoms
have demonstrated the ability to precisely measure e.g.,
gravity [1] and fundamental constants [2, 3], to test general relativity [4–6], and to search for new forces [7, 8].
A major obstacle to increasing their sensitivity, however, has been the limited time during which coherent,
spatially-separated superpositions of atomic wave packets can be interrogated. Up to 2.3 seconds of interrogation time has been realized in a 10-meter atomic fountain [9], and several seconds of interrogation time are the
target of experiments in fountains measuring hundreds
of meters [10, 11], zero-gravity planes [12], drop towers
[13], sounding rockets [14], and the International Space
Station [15–17]. Geometries that trap the interferometer
in an optical lattice [18, 19] have been explored, but attempts to date have suffered from dephasing in the trap.
Here, we demonstrate 20 seconds of coherence in an
atom interferometer held in an optical lattice, overcoming trap dephasing by using an optical cavity as a spatial
mode-filter. After 20 seconds, sensitivity to vibrations
is suppressed by 103 − 104 relative to traditional atomic
gravimeters at the same sensitivity, due to the continuous
accumulation of free evolution phase in the trapped wave
packets. Trapping the interferometer allows for the sensitivity to be increased by extending interrogation times
rather than wavepacket separations or free fall distances,
reducing experimental complexity and potentially minimizing systematics.
Our matter-wave interferometer builds upon the setup
described previously in [7, 20]. Cesium atoms are
laser-cooled to ∼300 nK, prepared in the magneticallyinsensitive mF =0 state, and launched millimeters upwards into free fall (see Methods for details). In free fall,
counter-propagating laser beams in the cavity manipulate the atomic trajectories. We stimulate two-photon
Raman transitions between the hyperfine ground states
of cesium, F = 3 and F = 4, imparting two photons’
momenta to the atom with each laser pulse. The pulse
intensities are tuned to kick atoms with 50% probability

the hyperfine ground states of cesium (typically corresponding to F = 3 and F = 4, respectively). Each pulse pair is
separated by a time T . Between the π/2 pulses and the lattice hold, atoms move in free fall towards the apex of their

relative velocity of 2vrec = 7 mm/s, where vrec is the recoil velocity of a cesium atom absorbing a photon on its
D2 line.
Our lattice interferometer employs two pairs of π/2pulses, as shown in Figure 1. The first pair, separated
by a time T , splits the matter-waves into four paths.
We select two of these paths, in which the wavepackets are vertically separated by a distance ∆z = 2vrec T
while sharing the same hyperfine ground state and external momentum. At the apex, we adiabatically load
atoms into the ground band of a far-detuned optical lat-

FIG. 2. Interference fringes and contrast decay. (A) Interference fringes are visible after holding the atoms for up to τ = 20
seconds (∼28,300 Bloch oscillations) in an optical lattice. Each data point (filled circles) is averaged over several interferometer
cycles. Error bars show the 1-σ spread. We fit each fringe to a sine function (solid lines) where the fitted amplitude gives
the fringe contrast, C. For each hold time, the mean asymmetry hAi is removed for clarity. This interferometer used a pulse
separation time of T = 0.516 ms and tA = 11 ms. The oscillation frequency is ωFE (∆n = 9) = 2π×(12.7 kHz), consistent with
the vertical separation of ∆z = 3.9 µm, or ∆n = 9 lattice sites. (B) Contrast measured (filled circles) as a function of hold
time τ and wavepacket separation ∆z. The contrast lifetime τC (∆z) for each wavepacket separation ∆z is extracted from fits

increasing wavepacket separation.

tice with a period of d = λlatt /2, where the laser wavelength is λlatt = 866 nm. The atoms are suspended in the
lattice for a time τ , undergoing Bloch oscillations [21–23]
with period τB = (mCs gd/h)−1 ≈ 707.5 µs, where mCs
is the atomic mass of cesium, and g is the local gravitational acceleration. Next, we adiabatically unload atoms
from the lattice and recombine the wavepackets using
the final pair of π/2-pulses. At the last pulse, the atomic
matter-waves interfere according to the phase difference
∆φ = φupper − φlower accumulated between the upper
and lower arms. As a result, the probabilities P3,4 of
detecting an atom in the output ports corresponding to
F = 3 and F = 4 oscillate with this phase difference
P3,4 = 12 [1 ± C cos(∆φ)], where C is the fringe contrast.
Since only two of the four spatially unresolved output
ports interfere, our maximum contrast is 0.5 in this geometry. We measure the atom number (N3,4 ) in each
port through fluorescence imaging and extract the total
interferometer phase ∆φ from oscillations in the popula3 −N4
tion asymmetry A = N
N3 +N4 = C cos(∆φ).

For traditional atomic gravimeters operating in free
space, the total phase ∆φ = ∆φL + ∆φFE is dominated
by the atom-light interaction phase ∆φL (”laser phase”),
while the free evolution phase ∆φFE is zero. Each laser
pulse contributes a phase φi proportional to the atoms’
position. For atoms in free fall, ∆φL can provide a sensitive measurement of accelerations such as gravity [1],
which influence the atoms position at each laser pulse.
This lattice-based interferometer realizes nearly the
opposite scenario in that the free evolution phase ∆φFE
constitutes more than 99% of the total phase alongside
only a small contribution from ∆φL . In this pulse sequence, ∆φL = (φ1 − φ2 ) − (φ3 − φ4 ) [18, 19]. Between
laser pulses, each arm accumulates a phase φFE which
can be calculated by integrating the Lagrangian L over
the classical trajectory [24]. Suspending the interferometer causes a phase difference

(0.2115 s). The oscillation frequencies verify the discretized arm separations that result from loading a half-integer initial
wavepacket separation. For ∆z2 /d = 1, 9, and 10, panels (E, F, H) show oscillation frequencies corresponding to the labelled
arm separations of ωFE (∆n=1), ωFE (∆n=9), and ωFE (∆n=10), respectively. (G) At ∆z2 /d = 9.5, oscillations at ωFE (∆n=9),
and ωFE (∆n=10) add, showing a beating interference in the free evolution phase at their difference frequency ωFE (∆n=1).

the lattice hold due to the gravitational potential energy
difference, ∆U = mCs g∆z, across a vertical separation
∆z. There is zero net contribution to the free evolution
phase outside of the lattice hold.
Figure 2A shows interference fringes due to the gravitational potential energy difference from a vertical separation of ∆z = 3.9 µm, corresponding to nine lattice
spacings. Fringes remain visible as the interferometer
is trapped for up to τ = 20 seconds, at which point
∆φFE = 1.6 Mrad. Without the lattice to hold atoms
against Earths gravity, interrogating atoms in free fall
for 20 seconds would require a vacuum system about
0.5 km tall. In this interferometer, atoms travelled less
than 2 millimeters. This allows highly sensitive yet very
compact atomic setups, which help suppress spatiallydependent systematic effects such as gravitational and
magnetic field gradients. Moreover, measuring ∆φFE by
increasing τ allows for the substantial suppression of systematics which are independent of the hold time.
Interferometer sensitivity increases with longer hold
times τ and larger wavepacket separations ∆z, with
a signal-to-noise proportional to the contrast. At the
smallest separation (∆z = 3.9 µm), we measure a 1/e

contrast lifetime in the lattice of τC (∆z) = 8.4(4) seconds (Fig. 2B). The contrast lifetimes decrease for larger
wavepacket separations (Fig. 2C), presumably from
residual imperfections of the cavity-filtered optical lattice beam.
In general, the optical lattice modifies the spatial structure of the atomic wavepackets. Operating the lattice interferometer requires an understanding of these dynamics. In a typical atom interferometer, contrast can be observed as long as the wavepacket positions at the time of
the final pulse are within the coherence length of the sample, as determined by the thermal de Broglie wavelength
λT of the atomic wavepacket. In our setup, this condition is met when the distance travelled by the partial
wavepackets after the third pulse ∆z2 = 2vrec T2 is within
λT of the initial wavepacket separation ∆z1 = 2vrec T1 ,
where T1 and T2 refer to the pulse separation times before and after the lattice hold, respectively (see Fig. 3A).
When matching the free-space wavepacket separations
∆z1,2 to an integer number ∆n of lattice spacings, contrast is observed within λT of ∆z2 = ∆z1 . This can
be seen in Fig. 3B by the peak in contrast around
∆z2 = ∆z1 = 9d.

FIG. 4. Lattice interferometer acceleration transfer function. Measured (black circles) and calculated (blue line) transfer
function, normalized to 1 at dc as |H (2πf )|2 / |H (0)|2 , for a lattice interferometer with T = 1.066 ms, and τ = 5.0 seconds.
A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with comparable dc acceleration sensitivity has a pulse separation time of TMZ = 73.5 ms,
whose transfer function is plotted in red. The lattice interferometer transfer function suppresses the phase noise arising from
mechanical vibrations in the critical ∼0.1-100 Hz frequency range by 2-3 orders of magnitude over the equivalent Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. Inset: Data and calculations are plotted on a linear scale and show good agreement. Each data point represents
the mid-fringe phase variance from ∼70 experimental runs, in response to an applied acceleration which pushes the vacuum
chamber at a drive frequency f . The transfer function measurement is detailed in Methods.

The finite spatial extent of the atomic wavepacket
can coherently distribute across multiple adjacent lattice
sites, leading them to acquire a finer spatial substructure
at the lattice spacing d. For atoms with λT ≥ d, the
partial wavepacket along each arm (see Fig. 3A) necessarily distributes into adjacent lattice sites, effectively
creating additional interferometer arms with a vertical
separation of ∆n = 1. We verify coherence between the
added paths in two ways. First, we measure a peak in
the contrast envelope near ∆z2 ≈ d, showing that components of the wavefunction separated by one lattice site
interfere. Accordingly, Figures 3B and 3D show spatial overlap within λT of ∆z2 = d for various choices
of ∆z1 . Second, we vary τ to obtain the free evolution fringe shown
in Fig. 3E.

ifies that ∆φFE accumulates from the gravitational potential energy difference across a vertical arm separation
of ∆z = d.
When the initial separation is a non-integer number of
lattice spacings ∆z1 6= ∆nd, lattice loading can cause the
wavepackets spatial distributions to differ between the
upper and lower arms. Figure 3C shows an example with
∆z1 = 9.5d: one arm splits between two adjacent lattice
sites, becoming two new interferometer arms which are
separated by ∆n = 1 from one another, and ∆n = 9
and 10 from the distant arm. We verify coherence by
changing ∆z2 to interfere different combinations of the
three arms; Figure 3D shows the corresponding contrast
envelopes within λT of ∆z2 /d = 1, 9, and 10. Moreover,
we vary τ to obtain free evolution fringes for each combination of arms (see Fig. 3 E, F and H, respectively).

The observed oscillation frequencies ωFE (∆n) show the
quantization of arm separations in multiples of the lattice
period d.
At ∆z2 /d = 9.5, the lower arm is partially spatially
overlapped with both upper arms, and the final pulse
closes the two interferometers with separations of ∆n =
9 and 10 simultaneously. As a result, we observe the adjacent wavepackets separated by ∆n = 1 coming into and
out of phase at their difference frequency ωFE (∆n = 1),
while interfering with the distant arm constructively after integer Bloch periods τ = N τB , or destructively after
half-integer Bloch periods τ = (N + 1/2)τB . This results in a beating interference in the free evolution phase,
which we observe by varying τ (see Fig. 3G).
Reaching seconds of phase coherence in the lattice allows this trapped interferometer to overcome the limiting noise source in state-of-the-art atomic gravimeters:
phase noise from vibrations [25, 26]. Instead of reducing
the vibrations themselves, seconds of hold time cut off
the interferometer phase sensitivity to vibration noise by
orders of magnitude across the problematic ∼0.1-100 Hz
range, where it is difficult to suppress [27]. For instance,
hold times of τ = 20 seconds cause the vibration noise
sensitivity to drop rapidly as the frequency rises above
10 mHz, suppressing the phase sensitivity to vibrations
by 3-4 orders of magnitude across the critical ∼0.1-100
Hz band. In Methods, we derive the interferometer phase
response to the acceleration noise caused by vibrations,
i.e. the acceleration transfer function H(ω), accounting
for vibration sensitivity of both ∆φL and ∆φFE .
2
We directly measure |H (2πf )| by using a voice coil
to apply accelerations to the vacuum chamber at a frequency f , and record the mid-fringe phase variance as the

5
drive frequency f is varied. Figure 4 shows the agreement
between the measured and calculated transfer functions,
2
2
|H (2πf )| /|H (0)| , for a lattice interferometer with T
= 1.066 ms and τ = 5.0 seconds. This measurement
2
confirms that |H (2πf )| oscillates at a frequency commensurate with the hold time, f0latt = 1/τ = 0.2 Hz.
For comparable dc acceleration sensitivity to this lattice interferometer, a Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer
would use a pulse separation time of TMZ = 73.5 ms, setting the first zero in its transfer function at f0MZ = 13.6
Hz, nearly 70x higher than f0latt . For a target dc sensitivity, the vibration immunity in this lattice geometry can
be further enhanced by increasing τ and decreasing T .
Overall, the lattice interferometer realizes an attractive
scheme for metrology by holding atoms to directly probe
the potential energy difference, rather than dropping
atoms to measure accelerations. This approach strongly
suppresses vibration noise while extending interrogation
times in a compact volume, overcoming the major limitations in conventional atomic gravimetry. This lattice
geometry is therefore well-suited for precision gravimetry
[26], with exciting prospects for geophysics [28], and fundamental tests of short-ranged forces such as dark energy
[7], Casimir forces [29], or short-ranged gravity [30]. Additionally, measuring the phase due to a potential without subjecting the atoms to an acceleration represents
a milestone towards observing a gravitational analogue
of the Aharonov-Bohm effect [31], which can provide a
novel measurement of Newton’s constant G through the
gravitational potential.

METHODS
Experimental sequence
Atom source

An experimental cycle begins by using a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D-MOT) to load cesium atoms
into a 3D-MOT near the center of our in-vacuum optical cavity, cooling the ensemble to sub-Doppler temperatures
∼ 10 µK. The atoms are then loaded into a 3D optical lattice and Raman sideband cooling is performed to lower
the ensemble temperature to near the recoil limit (< 300 nK). This final stage of laser cooling leaves atoms in the
|F = 3, mF = 3i stretched state. Upon release from the lattice, microwave pulses transfer the ensemble into the
magnetically-insensitive |F = 3, mF = 0i state.
Atoms are then loaded into the ground band of an optical lattice, where the lattice potential is formed by 852
nm light resonant to a TEM00 mode of the optical cavity. We perform a lattice launch, sending about ∼10% of the
atoms upwards into free fall. For the experiments shown in the main text, launched atoms reached the apex of their
trajectory after 20 ms of free fall time (corresponding to 1.96 mm). After the launch, a Doppler-sensitive Raman
π-pulse (Gaussian temporal profile, 130 µs FWHM) is applied to narrow the Doppler spread of the atomic ensemble
to ∼8 kHz before interferometry.

Interferometry

The first pair of π/2 laser pulses are applied as atoms move upwards towards the apex, where the first pulse
separation time T1 determines the spatial separation of the atomic wavepacket before the lattice hold. Before the
hold, a resonant ”blow-away” laser pulse selects the two paths corresponding to atoms in the state |g2 , p0 + ~keff i to
load into the lattice. Atoms are typically held in the |g2 i = |F = 3, mF = 0i hyperfine ground state. After unloading
the atoms from the lattice, another blow-away laser pulse removes atoms that have scattered lattice photons and
decayed to |F = 4i. Atoms that have scattered but decay into |F = 3i can remain trapped and contribute to contrast
loss.
The last pair of interferometry pulses occur as atoms move downwards after release from the lattice hold, and their
pulse separation time T2 determines the separation of the paths being interfered at the last pulse. We extract ∆φ by

7
computing the population asymmetry, A, which we use to normalize for fluctuations in the total atom number. We
fit the fringes to a sine function, whose amplitude C gives the fitted fringe contrast.
For adiabatic lattice loading (unloading), the lattice intensity ramps up (down) over 350 µs. The lattice uses a
wavelength of λlatt = 866 nm, which is the wavelength red-detuned of the D2 line that minimizes the scattering-perrecoil-depth when considering both the D1 and D2 lines, that still fits within the cavity mirror reflectivities. The
lattice power is intensity-stabilized to minimize atom heating effects due to fluctuating laser power.
Detection

We detect the number of atoms in each interferometer output port using fluorescence imaging. Immediately after the
end of the interferometry sequence, we apply a laser pulse which resonantly pushes atoms in the |F = 4i ground state
away from atoms in the |F = 3i state, spatially separating the two interferometer output ports. Once the clouds are
sufficiently far apart, we use MOT and repump light (resonant with the |F = 4i → |F 0 = 5i and |F = 3i → |F 0 = 4i
transitions, respectively) to image both output ports, collecting fluorescence from the atoms for about 15 ms on a
CCD camera.
The near-resonant light which excites the atoms also induces a large background signal on the camera caused by
scattering off of other components in our system. In order to isolate the fluorescence signal from the atoms, we first
collect the image If ore including the atoms and the background, and then after a delay of 40 ms in which the atoms
have fallen away we take a second image Iback which contains only background light. In the bulk of this work, we
directly extract the atomic signal Iatom = If ore − Iback by subtracting the background image from the foreground.
However, when using this approach, we find that the uncertainty in Iatom is dominated by the fluctuation of the
background light during the 40 ms gap between collecting the two images. This uncertainty in the atomic fluorescence
image dominates the uncertainty in the population asymmetry A, which is calculated from Iatom .
Interference fringes are readily visible with standard subtraction of the background image for hold times up to
15 seconds. When the participating atom number drops below ∼50,000 atoms however, the imaging noise from
background light can become almost comparable to the contrast.
In Figure 2A of the main text, we calculate the atomic signal I˜atom = If ore − I˜back using a more accurate estimate
˜
Iback of the true background signal constructed by using the information in If ore which is outside of the regions
containing atoms; our approach is similar to that discussed in chapter four of Ref. [32] in the context of removing
fringes from absorption images. Our procedure is detailed in the next paragraph; in brief, we begin by calculating an
orthonormal set of basis images B̃n which represent the typical spatial structures observed in the background images.
Then, for each measured image If ore , we construct I˜back by adding together the basis images with weights determined
by their overlap with the structures in If ore outside of the regions containing the atom clouds. This scheme relies on
the fact that the spatial correlation in the background light between different regions of the image is stronger than
the temporal correlation in the background light over the 40 ms delay.
Our procedure for constructing the background estimates I˜back proceeds as follows. Note that each image may be
thought of as a vector whose length is the number of pixels in the image, such that standard techniques of linear
algebra are applicable. First, we perform a principal component analysis (PCA) on a large set of average-subtracted
background images, which produces an orthonormal set of basis images Bn , sorted in ascending order by the amount
of variance in the set of background images which occurs along each basis image. In addition to the basis elements
produced by PCA, we prepend an additional element representing the pixel-wise average across all the background
images as the element B0 . We next apply a Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure to produce a modified set of
˜
basis images

Finally, for each image j we calculate the atomic signal I˜atom

reduces the excess noise caused by background light fluctuations by a factor of 1.6 relative to Iatom .

Optical cavity parameters

The optical cavity consists of a flat, gold-coated mirror (radius of curvature ROC1 = ∞) and a curved dielectric
mirror (ROC2 = 10 m). They are separated by a length L = 37.4886(2) cm, inferred from the measured free spectral
range FSR = 399.845(6) MHz. The length and radii of curvature determine the waist size w0 = 724 µm at the lattice
laser wavelength λ = 866 nm. This corresponds to a Rayleigh range zR = 1.90 m. The transverse mode spacing is
δfmn = 25.1 MHz. and contributes to the cavity’s spatial mode-filtering.
This cavity beam geometry is favorable for lattice interferometer. For the lattice hold, the cavity length is stabilized to the TEM00 Gaussian mode, suppressing the spatial influence of higher-order transverse modes by ∼8 cavity
linewidths γfwhm (per mode order) to smooth the trap potentials at each lattice site. Furthermore, the near-planar
cavity geometry has a Rayleigh range zR much greater than the interferometer arm separation ∆z ∼ 4 − 350µm,
allowing the trap potentials experienced by the two arms to be highly homogeneous.
The intensity reflectivities of the mirrors are R1 = 0.98 and R2 = 0.973 for the gold and dielectric mirrors,
respectively, at λlatt = 866 nm. The second is implied relative to the first (which is approximately known) via the
measured linewidth (full width at half maximum) γfwhm = 3.03(2) MHz. The finesse is therefore F = 132. This
resonant power enhancement results in ∼13 mW of input 866 nm light providing a lattice depth of ∼6 Erec for atoms
at the center of the cavity mode. More details about the cavity can be found in [20, 33].

Lattice laser frequency stabilization

Our basic laser lock scheme is described in detail in [20]. The length of a “transfer” cavity on the optical table
serves as a frequency reference for all lasers which enter the in-vacuum “science” cavity. This includes the lattice
laser (866 nm), the interferometry laser (852 nm), and a “tracer” laser (780 nm). (≤ 2 µW) of tracer light is used to
stabilize the length of the science cavity, while the other lasers which interact more strongly with the cesium atoms are
off. The length of the transfer cavity is stabilized in turn to a “reference” laser, which is locked to a cesium transition
through modulation transfer spectroscopy.
The lattice laser is frequency stabilized to the transfer cavity using a Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) scheme. A freespace electro-optic modulator (EOM) phase modulates the light to create sidebands at fPDH ∼ 25 MHz. This light
is sent through a fiber EOM, driven with a tunable high frequency (foffset ∼ 0.6-1.2 GHz). This makes copies of the
PDH error signal, separated by foffset . These first-order manifolds are tunable via foffset . Locking these manifolds to
the transfer cavity allows the lattice laser to be tuned into resonance with the science cavity.

Cavity vertical alignment to gravity

The radial trap frequency in the 1D lattice is low (≈ 3 Hz), so even a small projection of Earth’s gravity along
the radial direction would cause atoms to leak out the sides of the trap. To avoid this, the tilt of the optical cavity
is stabilized to within < 100 µrad of Earths gravitational pull. The tilt stabilization feedback has been described
previously (see the supplemental information in [7] for details), and uses an electronic tiltmeter signal to feed back to
air pads supporting the optical table. The setpoint along each axis is determined by maximizing the atom number in
a 6 second lattice hold.

Lattice interferometer vibration sensitivity analysis

Phase noise from vibrations has been studied for the traditional Mach-Zehnder geometry, where all of the measured
phase ∆φ comes from the laser phase ∆φL . We expand this formalism to quantify the effect of vibration noise in our
interferometer geometry, where the free evolution phase ∆φFE has a significant contribution.
In traditional interferometers, the position of the mirror that is used to retro-reflect the interferometer light sets the
inertial reference frame of the measurement. In the cavity interferometer however, the position of both cavity mirrors
sets the inertial frame. In considering vibration noise in our apparatus, the cavity can be treated as a rigid body since
the cavity length is stabilized with a feedback bandwidth of ∼45 kHz, much faster than the typical frequencies of
mechanical vibrations. To analyze the interferometer phase noise caused by cavity vibrations, we derive the transfer
function from acceleration noise of the cavity to phase noise in the lattice interferometer, for both the laser phase
∆φL and free evolution phase ∆φFE .

9
Lattice interferometer laser phase

The acceleration transfer function relating vibrations of the cavity to noise in ∆φL is derived here. To focus this
analysis on the phase noise from mechanical vibrations, which impact primarily the low frequency band of ∼1-100
Hz, the laser pulses are assumed to occur instantaneously (i.e. with zero pulse duration). As discussed in the main
text, the total lattice interferometer laser phase ∆φL resulting from the four π/2 pulses is
∆φL = (φ1 − φ2 ) − (φ3 − φ4 ).

(S1)

Consider a phase jump dφL which occurs at time tjump . A jump in the laser phase results from e.g. vibrations
changing the position of the cavity with respect to the atoms. This jump in dφL shifts the total interferometer phase
by dφ. These phase shifts dφ and dφL are related by the sensitivity function gL (t), which is defined as
dφ = gL (t)dφL

(S2)

From Eq. S1, if the phase jump occurs during between pulses 1 and 2, the total interferometer phase shifts by
dφ = −dφL . Similarly, if the phase jump occurs between the pulses 3 and 4, the interferometer phase shifts by the
opposite amount dφ = +dφL . Phase jumps dφL which occur during T 0 (between pulses 2 and 3) do not produce an
overall phase shift in the interferometer. This gives the following sensitivity function for the laser phase,

To compare with free evolution phase noise, the laser phase transfer function can be re-written in terms of the
acceleration noise caused by vibrations of the cavity. The laser phase noise due to vibrations φL (t) can be expressed
in terms of position noise,
φL (t) = keff (xcavity (t) − xatom (t))

(S7)

To convert to acceleration noise, consider a Fourier decomposition of the position noise where a perturbation at
frequency ω changes the relative position of the cavity mirrors and the atoms by x̃(ω). Taking the second timederivative gives an expression for the position fluctuations in terms of accelerations, x̃(ω) = − ω12 ã(ω). The laser

Lattice interferometer free evolution phase

We now derive the transfer function from the acceleration noise of the cavity to free evolution phase noise. As
discussed in the main text (see Eq. 2), this interferometer accumulates ∆φFE from the linear gravitational potential
gradient across the interferometer, ∆U = mg∆z, such that

to be
∆z = ∆nd ≈ 2vrec T =

(S13)

where ∆n is an integer number of lattice sites.
To extend the analysis of vibrations to ∆φFE , we can assume that the atomic wavepackets follow the vibrating
lattice. Cavity vibrations can be treated as the acceleration noise a(t) experienced by atoms trapped in the vibrating
lattice. Acceleration is a useful physical quantity here because it allows us to invoke the equivalence principle to
equate this noise a(t) to a noisy gravitational field g → g + a(t), for which the noisy potential energy entering the
interferometer can be expressed as
∆U = m a(t) ∆z

(S14)

A sensitivity function gFE (t) for the free evolution phase can then be defined via the relation
dφ(t) = gFE (t) [m a(t) ∆z(t)/~] dt,

(S15)

where dφ(t) is the amount of free evolution phase accumulated due to the noisy acceleration a(t) in the interval dt.
The additional factors set gFE to be unitless.
Vibrations of the cavity are coupled to the atoms while they are trapped in the lattice. Therefore, an acceleration
caused by a vibration of the cavity will only shift ∆φFE if it occurs during τ . The free evolution phase sensitivity

Transfer function measurement details

Figure 4 of the main text demonstrates a measurement of the lattice interferometer transfer function. A force Fvc
at frequency f was applied to the vacuum chamber using a voice coil. This results in interferometer phase noise
discussed above, with an acceleration noise power spectral density Sa (ω) ∝ a0 δ(ω − 2πf0 ). Measuring the variance of
a
(2πf0 )|2 .
the phase noise in this way gives the transfer function |Hlatt
The interferometer phase noise for a given voice coil drive frequency f is read out by running ∼ 70 shots of the
experiment sitting at mid-fringe, where the output port population ratio is linear in phase. The resulting population
a
ratio spread is then proportional to the phase noise spread. However, the envelope of |Hlatt
(ω)|2 varies by about two
orders of magnitude over the measurement’s frequency range. On the low-sensitivity end, measuring the interferometer
phase noise due to vibrations is limited by imaging noise. On the high end, the measured population ratio is no longer
linear with interferometer phase, and the phase spread is difficult to infer from the population ratio spread. As a
result, we use a fed-forward drive amplitude to keep the resulting phase spread between these two limits, as described
below.
The vacuum chamber is supported against gravity on seismic attenuation air pads with a resonance frequency
fres = 2.7 Hz. The applied force Fvc pushes against the spring force from the air pads, defining a new equilibrium
position zeq for the sum of gravity plus these two spring forces. All data was taken with f < 1 Hz, sufficiently below
fres that the transfer function of the air pads is approximately flat. That is, we can consider the motion of the vacuum
chamber to track the equilibrium position zeq .
A voice coil force at frequency f is linearly proportional to an applied current I(t) = I0 sin(2πf t). This implies a
motion of the vacuum chamber z(t) = z0 + δz sin(2πf t), where δz is the amplitude of the position displacement, and
is proportional to I0 . The resulting acceleration is
a(t) = −

a00
2

(2πf )

sin(2πf t) := a0 (f ) sin(2πf t)
2

While δz does not depend on f , a0 (f ) does. We thus feed-forward a factor proportional to (2πf ) to the amplitude
of the drive current. That is, the current that drives the voice coil is

2

I(t) = (2πf ) I0 sin(2πf t)

13
This gives an experimentally measurable phase variance across the full frequency range. We then correct for the
2
a
extra factor of (2πf ) in the drive to extract the transfer function |Hlatt
(ω)|2 | and to plot it in Fig. 4. The overall
amplitude of the data is fitted to the normalized transfer function; this is the only free parameter.
