Strong, long-range interactions present a unique challenge for the theoretical investigation of
quantum many-body lattice models, due to the generation of large numbers of competing states at
low energy. Here, we investigate a class of extended bosonic Hubbard models with off-site terms
interpolating between short- and infinite-range, thus allowing for an exact numerical solution for all
interaction strengths. We predict a novel type of stripe crystal at strong coupling. Most interestingly,
for intermediate interaction strengths we demonstrate that the stripes can turn superfluid, thus
leading to a self-assembled array of quasi one-dimensional superfluids. These bosonic superstripes
turn into an isotropic supersolid with decreasing the interaction strength. The mechanism for
stripe formation is based on cluster self-assemblying in the corresponding classical ground state,
reminiscent of classical soft-matter models of polymers, different from recently proposed mechanisms
for cold gases of alkali or dipolar magnetic atoms.

The effects of long-range interactions on quantum
phases of many-body lattice systems is a hot topic of
research [1–5], which is driven by outstanding advances
in precision experiments with strongly interacting magnetic atoms [6–10], polar molecules [11, 12], Rydbergexcited atoms [13, 14], ions [15–18], and neutral atoms
coupled to photonic modes [19–24]. For bosonic particles, exact numerical results from quantum Monte-Carlo
methods can in principle predict thermodynamic properties of any unfrustrated model. However, long-range
interactions in combination with confinement to periodic
potentials present a unique challenge as they generate a
proliferation of metastable low-energy states, whose number exponentially increases with the system size [25, 26],
even in the absence of external frustration. This usually
results in, e.g., devil’s staircase-type structures that are
essentially intractable [27–30].
Much interest was recently generated by the demonstration of stripe behavior in spin-orbit-coupled BoseEinstein condensates [31–35] as well as droplet formation
in clouds of dipolar magnetic atoms in the mean-field
regime [36–38], due to a competition of quantum fluctuations, short- and long-range interactions [37, 39, 40].
Exact numerical results have further demonstrated theoretically that anisotropic dipolar interactions for particles
confined to two dimensions (2D) can generate stripe behavior while preserving superfluidity [41, 42], corresponding to a possible realization of so-called stripe supersolidity [43, 44]. The latter has a long history in quantum
condensed matter, where it was first introduced as superstripe phase, in that non-homogeneous metallic structures with broken spatial symmetry were found to favor

superconductivity [45]. While the microscopic origin of
such a phase is still a subject of debate, it is clear that
a key role is played by a combination of strong interactions and the lattice potential. In this context, key open
challenges are to propose and understand basic mechanisms for (super)stripe formation on lattice geometries
of experimental interest and to provide exact theoretical
predictions in the regime of strong interactions.
In this work, we study the low temperature phase diagram of an ensemble of bosonic particles confined to
a square lattice geometry and interacting via a softshoulder potential. The latter has a finite range that

includes several lattice sites, thus interpolating between
nearest-neighbor and long-range physics, while remaining numerically tractable. We utilize numerically exact
quantum Monte-Carlo simulations to study the phase diagram of this system as a function of the interaction
strength, finding several novel features: (i) For sufficiently strong interactions, the ground state (GS) is a
highly anisotropic, insulating stripe crystal that emerges
due to cluster self-assembling in the corresponding classical GS. For intermediate interaction strength, we find a
surprising (ii) supersolid-supersolid quantum phase transition that separates an isotropic supersolid state from
(iii) a highly anisotropic stripe state. In the latter, superfluidity mostly occurs along horizontal (vertical) stripes
and is not suppressed at the supersolid-supersolid transition, while diagonal long-range order is found in the perpendicular direction – reminiscent of the so-called superstripe phase found in lattice-based superconductors [45].

where bj (b†j ) is the bosonic annihilation (creation) operator on site j, nj = b†j bj , and t is the nearest-neighbor
hopping energy on a square lattice of spacing a. In the
following t and a are taken as units of energy and length,
respectively. The last term of Eq. (1) represents the softshoulder interaction between bosons with strength V , rij
is the distance between sites i and j, with rc the inter-

action potential cutoff. In classical physics, this interaction is of interest for soft-matter models of, e.g., colloids [46–48]. In quantum physics, similar interactions
can be engineered in clouds of cold Rydberg atoms, by
weakly-admixing a Rydberg state to√the GS using laser
light [49–55]. Here, we choose rc = 2 2a for which in the
classical limit V /t → ∞ each particle tries to establish an
avoided square region of total area 16a2 [see Fig. 1(a)].
For density ρ = 1/9 this is indeed possible and the system can arrange into an optimal configuration characterized by zero potential energy by covering the lattice
with clusters of type I, see Fig. 1(a). Conversely, for
higher densities the classical GS corresponds to the solution of a tiling problem, where tiles are constituted by
clusters of particles and holes that are effectively bound
together by the repulsive interactions. The number of
such clusters, or tiles, increases with increasing particle
density. Figure 1(b) shows the three clusters I, II, and
III (i.e., the tiles) that appear at low energy for densities
1/9 < ρ < 1/6. Similarly to the 1D case [56, 57], the classical GS can then be built from the exponentially large
number of permutations of clusters I-III. This large degeneracy is characteristic of long-range interactions and
can in principle constitute an obstacle to the solution of
the quantum problem. In the following, we determine the
effects of quantum fluctuations on this highly degenerate
classical GS by computing the quantum phase diagram
for model Eq. (1), for an example density ρ = 5/36. Our
focus is the determination of quantum phases and phase
transitions in this system.
We study Hamiltonian Eq. (1) by means of path in-

diagonal long-range, and off-diagonal long-range orders,
respectively. Here, β = 1/(kB T ) is the inverse temperature, with kB the Boltzmann constant (set to unity); Wx
(Wy ) is the winding number along the x (y) direction,
k is a lattice wave vector and h. . . i stands for statistical
averaging. Calculations are performed on lattices of size
N = L × L, with L as large as L = 96 and temperatures as low as T /t = 1/96. We find that for T /t ≤ 1/20
results are essentially indistinguishable from the extrapolated GS ones.
The main results are presented in Fig. 2. Panels (a)
and (b) show estimates of the structure factor S(k)

and the superfluid fraction ρs /ρ (left ordinate axis) together with the ratio between the superfluid responses
ρx /ρy ≡ Wx2 / Wy2 along the horizontal and vertical
directions (right ordinate axis) as a function of V /t, for
T /t = 1/20 and N = 96 × 96, respectively. Examples of
finite-size scalings [panels (c)-(e) of the same figure] clarify that the chosen system size is large enough to provide
an accurate description of the various observables in the
thermodynamic limit, as results obtained for L = 96 essentially coincide with the extrapolated estimates. The
combination of S(k), ρs /ρ, and their anisotropies allows
for the determination of the quantum phases.
We find that for weak interaction strengths V /t <
∼ 2.6
the GS is a homogeneus superfluid (SF) with ρs /ρ > 0,
<
ρx ' ρy , and S(k) = 0. For 2.6 <
∼ V /t ∼ 4.45, however,
both the superfluid fraction and the structure factor are
finite, indicating the presence of a supersolid GS. Surprisingly, in this range of interaction strength we find two
distinct supersolids. Specifically, an isotropic supersolid
(IS) and an anisotropic stripe supersolid (SS) occur for
<

∼ V /t ∼ 4.0 and 4.0 ∼ V /t ∼ 4.45, respectively.
Within the IS phase, S(k) [Fig. 2(a)] takes its maximum value for k = (0, ±kc ) and (±kc , 0) (down- and
up-pointing triangles, respectively) with kc = 2π × 7/24;
in IS the superfluid response is isotropic [Fig. 2(b), diamonds]. In contrast, in the SS phase the diagonal longrange order is found along one direction only (i.e., the
y direction in the figure), being drastically suppressed
along the perpendicular one; in addition, the maximum
of the structure factor is found for k = (0, ±ks ), with

FIG. 5. Out-of-equilibrium density snapshot for a system
with L = 96, V /t = 4.1 after a quench down to target temperature T /t = 1/20. For this choice of parameters the corresponding equilibrium phase is a SS. The size of the dots is
proportional to the averaged occupation of the corresponding
sites.

ks = 2π × 1/3 6= kc , while S(0, ±kc ) = S(±kc , 0) = 0
[Fig. 2(a), triangles]. Here, the superfluid response becomes strongly anisotropic with ρx  ρy , signalling the
formation of superfluid stripes along the x-axis. This
corresponds to a transition to a self-assembled array of
essentially one-dimensional superfluids, which, unexpectedly, have larger superfluid density near the phase boundary: ρs /ρ initially increases within the SS phase, before
decreasing again, with increasing V /t.
Finally, for V /t >
∼ 4.45 the system loses its superfluid character and, although the maximum value of S(k)
still occurs for k = (0, ±ks ), secondary peaks emerge at
k = (±kc , 0). These latter peaks imply both crystallization along the stripe direction as well as the emergence of weak correlations between particles across different stripes (see below). The resulting GS is a normal
crystal.
We find that different metastable states with entirely
different quantum orders compete in the region of intermediate strengths of interactions V /t >
∼ 3.0. In order to determine the GS we perform two sets of simulations: namely, starting from the equilibrium configuration at V1 /t = 3.7 (V2 /t = 5.0) a careful annealing in
the interaction strength is performed with annealing step
0 < ∆V1 /t ≤ 0.1 (−0.1 ≤ ∆V2 /t < 0). When the desired
target value of V /t is reached the calculation leading to
a lower energy E is taken as the GS. Figure 2(f) shows
the relative energy difference ∆Erel = (E2 − E1 )/E1 as
a function of V /t. The change in sign at V /t ' 4.0 signals the phase transition between the IS and SS phases.
The corresponding sudden changes in crystalline order,
measured by discontinuities of the structure factors in
Fig. 2(a), are consistent with a first order phase transition between the two supersolids.
The formation of stripes remains favored for larger
V /t: hence, the phase transition from the SS to the stripe

The GS phase diagram of model (1) is summarized
in Fig. 3. The demonstration of the existence of novel
superfluid and insulating stripe crystals, as well as an
exotic supersolid-supersolid quantum phase transitions
due to classical cluster formation in a rather general
model with a simple isotropic interaction are the main
results of this work. Further insight into the discussed
ground states can be obtained from the density maps
in Fig. 3(b)-(e) and the corresponding Green’s function
Gx (Gy ) along the x (y) axis [Fig. 4]. As expected,
for small V /t (where the system is a homogeneous SF)
the average occupation number at each site equals the
density ρ [Fig. 3(b)]. Similarly, the Green’s functions
(GF) are equal in the x and y directions at all distances
(i.e., Gx ' Gy ), within the statistical error bars. They
become nearly flat at large distances, which is consistent
with the presence of off-diagonal (quasi) long-range
order [Fig. 4(a)]. In the IS phase [Fig. 3(c)] the isotropic
ordered structure formed by clusters of particles coexists
with quantum exchanges and superfluidity. Here, Gx,y
displays a weak power-law decay, indicating off-diagonal
quasi-long-range order, accompanied by oscillations
[Fig. 4(b)], which we find to have a periodicity consistent
with particle exchanges between different clusters,
thus identifying the underlying classical structure.
When stripes are formed in the SS phase, Fig. 3(d),
no density modulations appear along their direction
(i.e., the horizontal one). Gx is found to decay as a
power-law [Fig. 4(c)], consistent with the measured
finite superfluidity along the stripe direction. Long
exchange cycles of identical particles take place almost
exclusively along the stripes, being strongly suppressed
in the perpendicular direction. The overall picture here
is that of a 2D quantum system of quasi 1D superfluids
(i.e. the stripes). In the SC phase the emergence of a
nearly classical cluster-crystalline structure is evident
[Fig. 3(e)]. Here long quantum exchanges are completely
suppressed and clusters (and particles) can only slightly
fluctuate around their equilibrium position due to zero
point motion, implying an exponential decay of the GF’s
in Fig. 4(d), albeit with different slopes in the x and y
directions.
We find that the phases above are robust for density
variations within the range 1/9 < ρ < 1/6, where
clusters I-III appear at low energy for large V /t. In
the Supplementary Material [59] we demonstrate that
they also persist for ρ = 1/6, where only clusters of
type II and III exist for stong interactions, albeit with a
different cluster periodicity (i.e. different kc ).
Finally, to exemplify possible out-of-equilibrium scenarios that can emerge with imperfect annealing, Fig. 5

5
shows a density snapshot obtained when the system is
driven away from equilibrium via a temperature quench.
Here the target temperature is T /t = 1/20 for a value of
V /t at which the equilibrium phase is a SS. The resulting snapshot is isotropic rather than anisotropic with a
crystalline structure similar to panel (c) in Fig. 3, where
diagonal long-range order is found for characteristic wave
vectors k = (0, ±k ∗ ) and (±k ∗ , 0) with k ∗ 6= kc , ks , and
the value of ρs /ρ is much smaller than the equilibrium
one.
Increasing rc or smoothening the edges of the interactions can effectively result in the inclusion of more sites
in the interaction volume [59]. This can change the number and type of clusters that appear at low-energy, and
thus the resulting crystal structures. For example, for a
larger rc = 3a and ρ = 1/7 the strong-coupling phase is
a SC not oriented in the x or y-directions. In these cases,
we find that annealing can become increasingly difficult
as equilibration is often dominated by the presence of
many metastable states, typical of long-range models. A
detailed investigation of metastability for model (1) is
presented in [60].
We have demonstrated that stripe supersolid and
crystals may be realized in the ground state of bosonic,
frustration-free cluster-forming Hamiltonians.
In
particular, for intermediate interaction strength the
competition between quantum fluctuations and cluster
formation gives rise to a novel supersolid-supersolid
transition between an isotropic cluster supersolid and
an anisotropic stripe supersolid. These results exemplify
the complexities of the determination of quantum phase
diagrams of systems with long-range interactions, in a
regime where calculations are still feasible. Intriguing
out-of-equilibrium scenarios may also emerge and will be
the subject of future investigations [60]. Our predictions
should be of direct interest for experiments with cold
Rydberg-dressed atoms in an optical lattice [61, 62].
More generally, they constitute a step towards the
understanding of how long-range interactions can affect
the properties of ultracold gases.

between supersolid phases in a different model. However,

the transition is a change in density, rather than cluster
formation induced by the interaction potential at fixed
density.

We discuss the effects of variations in density and interaction range on the many-body phases
of [S1]. In particular, for a choice of density ρ = 1/6, we demonstrate the existence of a stripe crystal
for large values of interaction strength V /t and of a quantum phase transition from an anisotropic
supersolid to a homogeneous supersolid with decreasing V /t for Hamiltonian Eq. (1) in the main
text [S1].

QUANTUM PHASES OF HAMILTONIAN (1)
FOR DENSITY ρ = 1/6

The phases of Eq. (1) described in the main text for
ρ = 5/36 are representative of densities in the range
1/9 < ρ < 1/6, where the clusters of type I, II and III
in Fig. 1 dominate the dynamics for a large ratio V /t.
Here, we investigate the case ρ = 1/6, corresponding to
the smallest density increase for which the classical tiling
problem has a different structure, as only the clusters
of type II and III occur for large V /t. Calculations
are performed for system sizes up to N = 96 × 96 and
temperatures as low as T /t = 1/20.
The main results are presented in Fig. S1, where, following the definitions found in [S1], the structure factor
S(k) [panel (a)], the superfluid fraction ρs /ρ [panel (b)
left ordinate axis], and the ratio between the superfluid
responses ρx /ρy [panel (b) right ordinate axis] are plotted

The numerical results presented in [S1] are obtained
for a specific choice of density ρ = 5/36 and for√a softshoulder interaction potential with range rc = 2 2. Below we show that the main quantum phases and phase
transitions found in [S1] are robust for density variations
within the range 1/9 < ρ ≤ 1/6, where clusters of type II
and III (in addition to type I) fully determine the crystalline structure for large interaction strengths V /t, consistent with the discussion in the main text. This is explicitly shown below for the limiting case ρ = 1/6.
Variations of Hamiltonian terms such as the interaction range rc or shape can in principle lead to different
crystalline phases at strong coupling with respect to the
stripe crystal found in the main text. Below we discuss
the crystalline phases occurring by increasing rc or by
considering a smooth interaction potential instead of the
step-like potential of the main text.

For large enough interaction strengths V /t > 3.9, we
find a stripe crystal (SC) with no superfluidity, similar to
the case treated in the main text. However, the peaks in
S(k) occur here for k = (0, ±ks ) and k = (ksc , 0), with
ks = 2π/3 and ksc = 2π/4, respectively. The crystalline
order appearing on the x-axis is thus slightly different
from that of the SC phase in [S1] (ksc 6= kc = 2π × 7/24).
Similarly to the main text, by decreasing the interaction strengths we first find an anisotropic stripe
supersolid (SS) and then an isotropic supersolid (IS)
phase. The latter phases occur for interaction strengths

to the occupation number of the corresponding lattice site.

k = (±kc , 0) and k = (0, ±kc ), identical to the case
ρ = 5/36 discussed in the main text.
Further insight can be obtained from the density maps
in Fig. S2. In particular, panel (c) shows that for large
V /t in the classical regime the ground state corresponds
to a perfect crystalline tiling of the surface with just one
single kind of clusters (i.e., cluster II in the x−direction
in the figure). This results in a SC that is qualitatively
similar to the one of [S1], albeit with a slightly different
periodicity in the x-direction, as discussed above. By
decreasing V /t, a melting of this crystalline phase gives
way to the SS and then IS phases.
In conclusion, we find that the main results discussed
in [S1], namely the appearance of an anisotropic (stripe)
supersolid and a transition between two different supersolids (IS and SS), are robust against different choices of
density in the range 1/9 < ρ ≤ 1/6, as long as the strongcoupling low-energy physics is dominated by clusters of
the type II and III in Fig. 1, as expected. Further increasing densities with ρ > 1/6 introduces different kinds of
clusters in the classical ground state that alter both the
strong-coupling stripe crystalline structure, and the ensuing supersolid phases for intermediate values of V /t.
The corresponding quantum phases have then to be investigated on a case-by-case basis, for each density.

EFFECTS OF THE INTERACTION RANGE AND
SHAPE ON THE CRYSTAL PHASES OF EQ. (1)

Varying the interaction range rc in Eq. (1) can change
the number and shape of relevant clusters in the large
V /t limit. As a consequence, the many-body ground
state can change from the predictions of [S1]. As an

FIG. S3. Panel (a): Interaction volume corresponding to the
model Eq. (1) with the cutoff radius of the interaction being rc = 3.0. Panel (b): Side-density map of a system with
N = 28 × 28 showing a possible anisotropic crystalline structure forming for the choice rc = 3.0. The size of the dots is
proportional to the occupation number of the corresponding
lattice site. The data is taken from calculations at T /t = 1/20
and V /t = 6.0 at the fixed density ρ = 1/7.

example, Fig. S3(b) shows a site-density map of a normal
(not superfluid) crystalline phase appearing at V /t = 6
for a choice of interaction range rc = 3.0 and density
ρ = 1/7. The stripe crystal structure is now found
to point in a diagonal direction. Further increasing
rc to large values rc /a  1 progressively reduces the
stripe anisotropy, in favor of a triangular cluster crystal,
similar to the continuous case [S2].
Similar effects can be obtained by considering a
smoother potential, instead of the stepwise potential
of Eq. (1). As an example, Fig. S4 shows results for
a potential of the type V /[1 + (r/rc )α ], for different
values of α and V /t  1. For α → ∞ the shape of
this interaction approximates well the one in Eq. (1).
We find that for α >
∼ 10 stripe order is favoured along
the x-direction (y-direction) for V /t  1, similar to the
discussion for Eq. (1). For α <
∼ 10, however, the stripes
progressively give way to a more isotropic, triangular
crystalline structure. In particular, for α = 6 (relevant
for Rydberg dressed atoms) the density map [panel (c)]
and structure factor [panel (f)] indicate a triangular
crystal structure that is essentially isotropic in the x
and y directions. This can be qualitatively explained
by considering that lower values of α effectively include
more sites to the edges of the interaction volume for
each particle, different from the case of [S1]. [S3]
We find that strong metastable effects are often obtained in the numerical simulations for the situations discussed above in the intermediate regime of interactions
V /t >
∼ 1. The phase diagram has to be investigated on a
case-by-case basis.
