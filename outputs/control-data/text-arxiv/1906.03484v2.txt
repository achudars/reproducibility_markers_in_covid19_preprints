Critical phenomena of a second-order percolation transition are known to be independent of
cluster merging or pruning process. However, those of a hybrid percolation transition (HPT), mixed
properties of both first-order and second-order transitions, depend on the processes. The HPT
induced by cluster merging is more intrigue and little understood than the other. Here, we construct
a theoretical framework using the so-called restricted percolation model. In this model, clusters are
ranked by size and partitioned into small- and large-cluster sets. As the cluster rankings are updated
by cluster coalescence, clusters may move back and forth across the set boundary. The inter-event
time (IET) between two consecutive crossing times have two distributions with power-law decays,
which in turn characterize the criticality of the HPT. A burst of such crossing events occurs and
signals the upcoming transition. We discuss a related phenomenon to this critical dynamics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Complex systems composed of a large number of interacting components are constantly adapting to the changing environment and sometimes reach critical states [1, 2].
In these states, complex systems may be statistically
characterized by power-law distributions [3]. Examples
include the number of aftershocks per time step after
the main earthquake [4], nonstationary relaxation after
a financial crash [5], the number of fires with a certain
area per time step as a function of the area in forest
fires [6, 7], and the interevent time (IET) distribution in
human activities [8]. Such critical phenomena occur in
a self-organized manner, but a single framework describing their underlying mechanisms has not yet been established [3, 9, 10]. In contrast, in critical states of complex
systems, a small external perturbation imposed on a system can lead to widespread failure of the system through
avalanche dynamics [11]. Examples include blackouts in
electric power-grid systems [12–14] and firing in neuronal
networks [15, 16] in real-world systems, and k-core percolation [17–19] and disease contagion models [20–22] in
artificial model systems. In such cascade dynamics, the
avalanche sizes of different events form a power-law distribution. These behaviors have been explained by a universal mechanism (the critical branching process), which
was also observed in self-organized criticality in the Bak,
Tang, and Wiesenfeld (BTW) model [23, 24].
Avalanche dynamics can be clearly observed in k-core
percolation. The k core of a network is a subgraph,
in which degree of each node is at least k. To obtain
a k-core subgraph, once an Erdős–Rényi (ER) random
network composed of N nodes having links between two
nodes with probability p is generated in the supercritical regime, all nodes with degrees less than k are deleted
consecutively until no more nodes with degrees less than
k remain in the system. The number of nodes deleted

during these consecutive pruning processes is considered
as the avalanche size. The fraction of nodes remaining
in the largest k-core subgraph is defined as the order parameter m, which decreases continuously with decreasing
p at criticality. When p is chosen as a transition point
pc , the deletion of a node from an ER network can lead
to collapse of the giant k-core subgraph. Thus, a hybrid
percolation transition (HPT) occurs, which exhibits features of first-order and second-order phase transitions.
The avalanche size distribution shows power-law decay
as Pa (s) ∼ s−τa , where τa = 3/2 at pc , similar to that
in the BTW model. Furthermore, there exists a critical avalanche of size O(N ), which may correspond to the
dragon king often noted in complex systems [3, 25].
In contrast to the HPTs induced by cascading dynamics, HPTs in cluster merging dynamics (CMD) have received little attention. In this paper, we aim to investigate the underlying mechanism of the HPT on a microscopic scale using the so-called restricted Erdős–Rényi
(r-ER) network [26, 27]. Then, we set up a theory of the
HPT. The model contains a factor that suppresses the
growth of large clusters. Accordingly, the type of percolation transition is changed to a discontinuous transition [28], similar to the case in which the 1/r2 -type
long-range interaction changes the transition type to the
first-order type in the one-dimensional Ising model [29].
However, this factor does not guarantee the occurrence of
critical behavior. Here, we uncover a underlying mechanism and find another factor that governs the critical
behavior of the HPT induced by the CMD.
This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we recall a r-ER model for the HPT. In Sec. III, we exmaine
the cluster evolution of the r-ER model macroscopically
and microscopically. Then we characterize the size distribution of finite clusters by constucting a theoretical
framework analogous to that of the conventional percolation theory. In Sec. IV, we introduce inter-event times
and their distribution, and then show that the inter-event
time distribution exhibit two power-law decays depending on time windows. We obtain the two exponents of the
IET distribution analytically and numerically and then

2
show that these exponents are related to the exponents
characterizing the HPT. In Sec. V, we introduce unconventional patterns that emerge together with the HPT
such as a burst and the Devil’s staircase and discuss an
application of the model. A summary is presented in
Sec. VI.

II.

r-ER MODEL

The CMD of the r-ER model proceeds in a dichotomous and asymmetric way. Initially, there are N isolated
nodes. Clusters are formed as links are connected oneby-one between pairs of unconnected nodes under the
rule given below. Clusters are ranked by size and classified into two sets, A and B, which contain a portion
gN (0 < g ≤ 1) of nodes of the smallest clusters and the
remaining large clusters, respectively. Two nodes are selected for connection as follows. One node is chosen randomly from set A, and the other is chosen from among
all the nodes. They are connected by a link unless they
are already connected. Then the classification is updated
as the cluster rankings are changed. Time is defined as
t = L/N , where L is the number of occupied links, and it
is the control parameter of the r-ER model. This quantity differs from p in k-core percolation in the point that
the CMD at a certain time t1 successively follows the
dynamics of previous times, whereas the avalanche dynamics at a certain p1 may be independent of those at
any previous p > p1 .
The nodes in set A have twice the opportunity to be
linked compared to the nodes in set B; small clusters
in set A grow rapidly, and the resulting large clusters
may move to B, whereas the smallest clusters among the
clusters in set B that have never grown or are growing
slowly are evicted to A. Accordingly, cluster coalescence
occurs in a dichotomous way, and the growth of large
clusters is practically suppressed. The effective suppression becomes global as the portion of the smallest clusters
is selected from among clusters of all sizes. This factor
leads to a discontinuous percolation transition.

III.

CLUSTER EVOLUTION TO HPT

We first consider cluster evolution on a macroscopic
scale. In the early time regime, the order parameter
m(t) (the fraction of nodes belonging to the giant cluster) is o(N ), and the cluster size distribution ns (t) exhibits power-law decay in the small-cluster region, but
exponential decay in the large-cluster region. As time
proceeds, medium-size clusters accumulate and form a
bump in the cluster size distribution ns (t), as shown in
Fig. 1(a) and Appendix B. Technically, we trace m instead of t in simulations to reduce large sample fluctuations arising around the transition point of the HPT. We
estimate a characteristic time ta , around which a giant
cluster of size ma N ∼ O(N ) emerges and the bump size

becomes maximum. ma denotes m(ta ). Soon after that,
m(t) increases rapidly, as shown in Fig. 2(a). ta is estimated numerically as explained in Appendix A. At tg ,
the order parameter m(tg ) (denoted as mg ) is equal to
1 − g. This means that set B is occupied by the giant
cluster alone. Beyond tg , the giant cluster size exceeds
the capacity of set B. In this case, the giant cluster is
regarded as belonging to set A, along with all the other
clusters [27]. The boundary between the two sets is eliminated. Note that this rule was not clearly specified in
the original half-restricted model [26]; however, this rule
is necessary to reach a critical state at tc . Therefore, the
r-ER model reduces to the original ER model but with
the ns (tg ) of finite clusters and the giant cluster [27].
As time proceeds further to a transition point tc , the
bump disappears completely, and the size distribution of
finite clusters ns exhibits power-law decay, ns (tc ) ∼ s−τ
(Fig. 2(a)), where τ (g) varies continuously with the parameter g [27]. The order parameter at tc is denoted as
mc . The interval [ta , tc ] has been revealed to be o(1) [26].
Therefore, the order parameter is regarded as discontinuous at tc in the limit N → ∞. For t > tc , the order
parameter increases continuously with the critical behavior, m(t) − mc ∼ (t − tc )β . A hybrid transition occurs in
the order parameter. We divide the time interval [0, tg ]
into two windows. In [0, ta ], ns exhibits power-law decay
with an extra bump, whereas during [ta , tg ], the bump
shrinks, and the giant cluster grows dramatically. These
behaviors clearly indicate that these two intervals need
to be considered separately.
Next, we consider cluster evolution microscopically.
We check the evolution of the largest cluster size among
all the clusters in set A, denoted as sA (t). We find empir0
ically that sA ∼ (tg − t)−1/σ for t ∈ [0, ta ], which is analogous to the relationship used in conventional percolation theory. We measure the exponent σ 0 directly
in Ap0
pendix B and using the relation ṡA /sA ∼ sσA (Fig. 1(c)),
where the dot over sA represents the time derivative. The
exponent σ 0 (g) is almost one for g = 0.2 but decreases
slowly with increasing g, as shown in Appendix B. Note
that the value of σ 0 differs from σ that is conventionally
defined for the characteristic cluster size in the supercritical regime, where σ = 1 independent of g [27]. Interestingly, sA (t) is located around the peak position of the
bump in ns (t) for different t but is implemented using
the corresponding m value, as shown in Fig. 1(a). This
behavior appears for different system sizes, as shown in
Fig. 1(b). The peak at sA implies that clusters with sizes
similar to sA (t) are abundant in the system even though
the bump shrinks as t increases beyond ta .
More specifically, we consider how a cluster ci of size
si evolves during the bump formation period [0, ta ]. A
schematic illustration is presented in Fig. 3.
i) Suppose that a cluster c0 is evicted from set B to
A at time t0 . If t0 = 1, cluster c0 has size s0 = 1 in
set A. Next, c0 is merged with other clusters and
grows, but it is still small enough that it does not
move to B.

FIG. 2. Evolution of the giant cluster, IET, and burst: (a) Typical staircase growth of the largest cluster size per node
m(t) for g = 0.2. The giant cluster of size O(N ) forms at time ta and grows rapidly. Soon afterwards, at tg , it completely fills
set B. Subsequently, the system follows ER dynamics and reaches a transition point tc , at which ns (tc ) ∼ s−τ (right inset)
for finite clusters. The IET distributions Pd (z) are accumulated in the intervals [0, ta ] (left) and [ta , tg ] (middle), respectively.
They exhibit power-law decays with the exponents α ≈ 1.03 and 1.87, respectively. (b) A succession of inter-set A (colored) ↔
B (white) switching events demonstrate the bursty nature of this heavy-tailed process.

ii) Until time t1 , cluster c0 grows and has size s0 (t1 ).
At time t1 , cluster coalescence occurs as c0 + cj →
ck , and the cluster size changes as sk = s0 (t1 ) + sj ,
where cluster cj is in either set A or set B. We
consider the case that the cluster size sk becomes
larger than sA (t1 ), and thus cluster ck moves to B.
iii) Cluster ck grows slowly to the size sk0 in set B until
time t2 . If the size sk0 becomes smaller than sA (t2 )
for the first time, then cluster ck is evicted to A.
Then the evolution returns to step i).
This cycle is a prototypical pattern of cluster evolution
up to the time ta . During this cycle, small clusters (e.g.,
c0 ) in set A have more opportunities to grow, whereas the

growth of large clusters in set B (e.g., ck ) is suppressed.
Accordingly, clusters of medium size become abundant
and form a bump around sA (t), as shown in Fig. 1(a).
During the interval ta < t < tg , a non-negligible
amount of cluster coalescence occurs between a large cluster in set A and another large cluster in set A or the giant
cluster in set B. In this case, step iii) must also include
the following event.

iii0 ) Cluster ck of size sk0 grows further by merging with
clusters in set A, and sk0 (t) ≤ sA (t) never occurs
through tg .

FIG. 3. Schematic diagram of a typical cluster lifecycle: A cluster is born with size s0 and grows through coalescence. Each constituent node of a cluster may have a different
age (time since its birth). After sufficient growth in set A, a
cluster is transferred to set B, where its growth is limited.

IV.

INTER-EVENT TIME DISTRIBUTION

The cycle of steps i)–iii) is analyzed in terms of the duration time [8], which indicates how long a node remains
in one set before switching to the other. Whenever a node
i switches from one set to the other, the duration time is
reset to zero. The update process of the duration time is
described in detail in Appendix C. In Fig. 2(b), the horizontal axis denotes time, and the boundary between two
domains (indicated by alternating use of color) represents
an event in which a cluster of a given node i moves from
one set to the other set. The interval between two consecutive boundaries is called the duration time (or IET
of node i) and is denoted as zi . For each node i, there

where q1 (s0 ; t0 ) is the probability that a cluster of size s0
in set B is evicted to set A at t0 by an event in which a
cluster larger than s0 moves from A to B at t0 . Further,
q(st0 +t ; t0 +t) is the probability that cluster c0 remains in
set A with size st0 +t at time t0 + t. Next, we use the rela0

for s ≤ sA . Then we obtain Pd (z) ∼ z −(4−τ −σ ) . A
detailed derivation of the above equation is presented in
Appendix C.
We also obtain the above result using simple dimensional analysis [23]. We calculate the average waiting
time of a cluster to be selected randomly for cluster merging, which is found to be inversely proportional to the
cluster size s, as explained in Appendix. Thus, the expected duration time of a node belonging to a cluster of
size s is hzs i ∼ 1/s. The IET distribution is related to

can exist many duration times generated by those setcrossing events. The IET distribution Pd (z) can be constructed by accumulating these duration times over all
nodes during a given time interval, for instance, [0, tg ].
We find that the IET distribution exhibits power-law decay as Pd (z) ∼ z −α (inset of Fig. 2(a)). The exponent α
depends on the time window. For [0, ta ], α is measured
to be approximately one for g = 0.2, being insensitive to
g as long as g is not close to one. This exponent value
is also insensitive to the set-crossing type (either from
A to B or from B to A). During the window [ta , tg ],
the exponent α, alternatively denoted as α0 , is found to
be α0 = 4 − τ for the type A → B, and is less than two.
However, for the type B → A, we obtain α0 > 2. We note
that in the latter case, the duration times that were reset
to zero before ta remain, even though they are measured
during the window [ta , tg ]. Because the IET distribution
for the window [ta , tg ] decays rapidly, the exponent α
measured during the entire period [0, tg ] is governed by
the values measured during the window [0, ta ], and thus,
the exponent α is close to one.
We obtain the IET distribution analytically. Let us
consider the case in which a cluster c0 of size s0 is evicted
from B to A at time t0 > 0. A node belonging to cluster
c0 has more opportunity to be selected. Thus, cluster
c0 grows rapidly in set A, and it returns to B for the
first time at a time t1 = t0 + z, at which its size becomes
larger than sA (t1 ). Then all s0 nodes that belonged to the
original cluster c0 at time t0 have duration time z, which
is accumulated in the IET distribution. The probability
PdA→B (z) that such events happen during the interval
[0, tg ] is calculated as

Next, we check the age distribution of bank mergers and

since the year 1900. It shows a power-law decay with
a different exponent. The details are presented in Appendix E.

Interestingly, even though the exponents τ and σ 0 depend
on the control parameter g, the exponent α = 1, independent of g and universally. We note that the susceptibility
exponent, γ = (3 − τ )/σ 0 = 1, is obtained from set A.
However, we remark that the limiting case g → 1 of the
restricted model reduces to an ordinary ER model, in
which τ = 5/2 and σ 0 = 1/2. Thus, τ + σ 0 = 3 holds. For

this case, we find that hns (t)it ≡ t1c 0 c ns (t)dt ∼ s−τ −σ ,
and Pd (z) ∼ z −1 . In the ER model, z may be interpreted
as the age in the birth-to-death process. We confirm the
result numerically, as shown in Appendix E.
Next, we calculate the IET distribution Pd (z) in
[ta , tg ], which is composed of duration times that terminate in the interval [ta , tg ]. During this short interval, the probability of selecting a cluster
of size s may
∗
be regarded as sns (tg ) ∝ s1−τ e−s/s (tg ) , where s∗ (tg )
is constant, and thus σ 0 = 0. In this case, Pd (z) =
s · sns |∂s/∂hzi| ∼ z −(4−τ ) . The exponent α0 = 4 − τ
is in reasonable agreement with numerical results for the
process A → B, as shown in Appendix C. Note that the
two relations, α = 4−(τ +σ 0 ) = 1 for [0, ta ] (and even for
[0, tg ]) and α0 = 4 − τ for [ta , tg ], enable us to determine
the static exponents τ and σ 0 for the cluster size distribution, once we have measured the dynamic exponents
α and α0 . Furthermore, the exponent τ determines the
critical exponents β and γ associated with the order parameter and the susceptibility as β = τ −2 and γ = 3−τ ,
respectively [27]. Therefore, the IET exponents α and α0
characterize the critical behavior of the HPT induced by
cluster coalescence. We summarize these relationships in
Fig. 4.

V.

DISCUSSIONS

We remark that the exponent α is closely related to
the exponent of the age distribution of the birth-to-death
process in cluster merging kinetics. This age is defined
as the interval between two consecutive cluster mergings.
The reason is as follows: the exponent α is determined in
the early time regime, in which clusters are overall small
and thus when a cluster in set A is merged with another
cluster regardless of from set A or B, it is likely to move to

Overall, we find that cluster inter-set crossing events
occur more frequently as time passes, as shown in
Fig. 2(b). We examine the number of crossing events,
denoted as Nevent (t), as a function of time by counting
the number of nodes that switch from one set to the other
at a given time t. We argue that Nevent (t) ∼ 1/hzis ∼
s∗ (t) ∼ (tg − t)−1 with some cutoff. Thus, a burst occurs in the inter-set crossing as the time approaches tg .
Numerical data are presented in Appendix F. The burst
may signal the upcoming HPT.
We note that the dynamic critical features of Pd (z)
and Nevent (t) are not limited to the r-ER model. Rather,
we find similar behaviors in the CMD of the ER model.
However, whereas the IET distribution in the r-ER model
has two distinct power laws in two different time windows, as shown in the insets of Fig. 2, the behavior in the
second regime, [ta , tg ], does not occur in the ER model
because the transition is continuous. The details are presented in Appendix D.
Owing to the suppression effect, medium-sized clusters
are accumulated and form a bump in the cluster size distribution. As more time passes, clusters in the bump are
merged with each other (or with other small clusters),
and then a giant cluster emerges and grows in a Devil’s
staircase pattern in a short time period, [ta , tc ] [31]. The
Devil’s staircase pattern shows a power-law jump distribution, Pm (∆m) ∼ (∆m)−δ ; the exponent δ exhibits
crossover behavior from δ1 = τ − 1 to δ2 = (1 + η)/ζ,
where η and ζ are the phenomenological exponents associated with the order parameter. More details are presented in Appendix G.

CONCLUSION

We have investigated the underlying mechanism of the
HPT induced by cluster merging dynamics using the rER model, finding that the IETs between two consecutive
set-crossing times have two distributions with power-law
decays. This impiies that there exists a self-organized
critical (SOC) behavior previously unrecognized in the
HPT. We established a theoretical framework for the
HPT, analogous to the conventional percolation theory,
and showed that the exponents of the IET distributions
determine the critical behavior of the HPT. This SOC
behavior is comparative to the critical branching process
governing the avalanche dynamics of the HPT in pruning
process.

POPULAR SUMMARY

Percolation has long served as a paradigm for diverse
phenomena in multidisciplinary area such as network resilience, socio-community formation, and disease contagion. Percolation transition (PT) is known as one of
the most robust second-order (continuous) transitions.
However, PTs that occur in complex systems often appear in diverse types including first-order (discontinuous) and hybrid transitions. Hybrid percolation transitions (HPTs) exhibit mixed properties of first-order and
second-order transitions.

Appendix B: Development of power law region in
the cluster size distribution ns (t) and maximal bump
height at ta

A power law slope of ns is slowly developed as the rER dynamics proceeds. Around the time ta , the height
of bump becomes maximum as shown in Fig. 6(d)−(i),
and a giant cluster of size ma N ∼ O(N ) begins to grow
as in the explosive percolation [30]. From then the giant
cluster size rapidly increases during the interval [ta , tc ]
of o(N ), which signifies a discontinuous transition in the
thermodynamic limit. At the same time bump erodes
away and a pure power-law cluster size distribution is
formed at tc .

HPTs can occur through pruning and cluster merging
processes (CMD). The HPT induced by CMD, denoted
as HPT-CMD, is more intrigue and little understood,
compared to the HPT in pruning process which is driven
by critical branching processes. In this paper, we uncovered the critical behavior underlying the HPT-CMD
and established a theory for the HPT-CMD using the socalled restricted percolation model. In this model, clusters are ranked by size and partitioned into small- and
large-cluster sets. As the cluster rankings are updated as
clusters are merged, clusters may move back and forth
across the set boundary. The inter-event times (IETs)
between two consecutive crossing times have two distributions with power-law decays, implying a new type of
self-organized critical (SOC) behavior. Those are related
to the formation and elimination of a bump in the size
distribution of finite clusters.

We assign a duration time z` to each node `. Initially,
at t = 0, z` = 0 for each node `. The duration time
of each node ` is updated at each time step as follows:
Suppose two nodes i and j are selected from the system
under the given rule at a given time t. Here unit time is
taken as 1/N .

We showed that this SOC behavior characterizes the
criticality of the HPT. Moreover, a burst of such crossing
events occurs and signals the upcoming transition. We
hope this uncovered mechanism can be used for understanding other dynamic critical phenomena with dragon
kings.

ii) If the two nodes belong to two distinct clusters ci
and cj of sizes si and sj , respectively, in set A, then
they are connected. Accordingly, the two clusters
are merged into a new cluster ck of size sk = si +sj .

Appendix A: Determination of ma

First, we determine ta as the intercept with the t axis
of the tangential line of m(t) at the inflection point of
m(t) in the region 0 < t < tc . Then ma = m(ta ) (Fig. 5).

Appendix C: The inter-event time distribution

i) If the two selected nodes belong to the same cluster in set A, they are connected unless there is already a link. The duration times of all nodes in
the system ` ∈ A, B are increased by a unit time
z` → z` + 1/N . The constituent nodes and cluster
sets of the system remain the same.

ii-1) If sk ≤ sA , then cluster ck remains in set A.
The duration times of each node ` in both sets
are updated as z` → z` +1/N . The constituent
nodes of both sets remain the same. Note that
as a result of this coalescence process, nodes
in the same cluster ck have different duration
times.
ii-2) If sk > sA , cluster ck is moved to B, and an
approximately same mass of clusters is transferred from B to A, in order to retain the mass
restrictions of sets A and B. Consequently,
one or two of the smallest clusters in set B are
ejected to A. The duration times of all the
emigrant nodes are accumulated in the IET
distribution Pd (z) and then reset to zero. The
duration times of all the other nodes are updated as z` → z` +1/N . sA may or may not be
increased depending on the sizes of the ejected
clusters.
iii) If the two selected nodes belong to clusters ci ∈ A
and cj ∈ B of sizes si and sj , respectively, the duration times zi of each node i ∈ ci are accumulated

7
in the IET distribution Pd (z), and then those duration times are reset to zero (zi = 0). The duration
times of each node j in cluster cj are updated as
zj → zj + 1/N . The two clusters are merged, generating a cluster ck of size si + sj in B. One of the
smallest cluster in B, denoted as c` , is ejected to
A, and the duration times of each node in c` are
accumulated in Pd (z). Then they are reset to zero.
The IET distribution can be constructed by collecting
these duration times over all nodes during a given time
interval, for instance, [0, tg ]. We find that the IET distribution exhibits power-law decay as Pd (z) ∼ z −α . The
exponent α is close to unity for g = 0.2 and 0.5; for such
small values of g, the exponent appears to be insensitive
to changes in g. However, the exponent α is sensitive
to the time interval in which the IET distribution is accumulated. When we accumulate the IET distribution
during the interval [0, ta ], α ≈ 1, but for the interval
[ta , tg ], α0 ≈ 4 − τ . The reason is the different dynamics
during each interval. Because the IET distribution decays rapidly in the interval [ta , tg ], the exponent α for the
distribution accumulated in the interval [0, tg ] is close to
one.
We consider in detail the behavior of the IET distribution for the duration in set A, which is denoted as
PdA→B (z). Let us consider the case in which a cluster c0
of size s0 moves from B to A at time t0 > 0. Cluster
c0 grows in A as it is subsequently merged with other
clusters, and then it returns to B at time t1 = t0 + z,
because its size becomes larger than sA (t1 ). sA (t) is the
maximum size of the clusters in set A at time t, which
divides the system into the two sets A and B. It increases
with time. Then s0 nodes that belonged to the original
cluster c0 at time t0 have duration time z in set A. The
evolution of cluster c0 is depicted schematically in Fig. 3
of the main text. Each constituent node of a cluster may
have a different IET. After sufficient growth in set A, a
cluster is transferred to set B, where its growth is limited. We measure the duration time a node spends in
one set before it moves to the other set. The probability PdA→B (z) that such events happen is calculated as
Eq. (1), where q1 (s0 ; t0 ) is the probability that a cluster
of size s0 in B makes a room for some other immigrant
cluster from A and is ejected to A at time t0 . The probability q1 is given as
q1 (s0 ; t0 ) = 1 −

X ini (t0 )jnj (t0 )

(C1)

i+j≤s0

Further, q(st0 +t ; t0 + t) is the probability that cluster c0
remains in set A with size st0 +t at time t0 + t. For it
to remain in set A, it is necessary that u < t, st0 +u ≤
sA (t0 + u). q(st ; t0 + t) is calculated as follows:
(i) Let the size of cluster c0 at t0 + t − 1 be denoted as
st0 +t−1 . A node in this cluster is selected at t0 +t−1 from
among all nodes in set A with probability st0 +t−1 /gN .
Next, a node is selected from a cluster of size j in the
entire system, which occurs with probability jnj (t0 + t −

1). At time t0 + t, the two nodes are linked, generating
a cluster of size st0 +t = st0 +t−1 + j. This size needs to
be less than or equal to sA (t0 + t). This occurs with

(C4)
Qz−1
The product t=1 q(st0 +t ; t0 + t) depends on the full
history of the size evolution of a cluster that was born
with size s0 at time t0 and grew during the duration time
z.
To calculate Eq. (1), we consider the largest cluster
size sA (t) at time t averaged over different realizations.

To calculate q1 and q, we need the explicit form of
the cluster size distribution ns (t). Even though the cluster size distribution includes a bump in the medium-size
region centered at sA (t), we ignore the contribution of
the bump to the probabilities q and q1 without losing
the essence. Moreover, we take the power-law region up
to sA (t). That is, ns (t) ∼ s−τ for s ≤ sA (t), where τ
dependsPon g (Fig. 6(a)−(c)). Then, from the normalsA

and (C16). Then it is noticed that the (C18) corresponds
to an integral representation of incomplete beta function.
This integral can asymptotically evaluated as in (C19) for
sufficiently large upperbound of the integral sA (tg )  1.
Moreover, in the limit of large interval z we have the
asymptotic expression (C20). Therefore, we finally obtain the relation

In the main text, we argue that τ + σ 0 = 3. Thus, α = 1.

In Fig. 8, we show that this analytic result is consistent
with numerical data.

Appendix D: Waiting time distribution

Here we calculate the IET distribution Pd (z) by an
alternative method. We consider the mean waiting time

s−τ −σ as shown in the Fig. 9(a). In the ER cluster aggregation process, waiting time roughly corresponds to
the birth-to-death age. We find instead of (C21) that
the age distribution of nodes follows a heavy tailed distribution P (a) ∼ a−(4−τ −σ) ∼ a−1 . The age distribution was accumulated during the whole subcritical regime
t ∈ [0, 0.5], selectively for those nodes in the merging
clusters (Fig. 9(b)). The waiting time z of r-ER model
is absent in the ER model, but the waiting time can be
conceptually extrapolated to the age a in the limit g → 1.
Actually, the age distribution can be also measured for
the r-ER model. It reveals that the distribution has the
same exponent value, as shown in the Fig. 9(c). We remark that the exponent α is determined in the early time
regime, in which clusters are overall small and thus when
a cluster in set A is merged with another cluster regardless of from set A or B, it is likely to move to set B.
Thus, the age distribution in ER and r-ER models and
the IET distributions in r-ER model behave similarly.
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) of corporations is a
birth-death process which we view as a cluster merging
process. Even though M&A of corporations are caused
by many different reasons such as economic shocks and
manager’s overconfidence, here we apply the random selection rule as used in ER and r-ER models as a minimal
model. Moreover, we argue that r-ER model is more
appropriate than ER model, because two big banks are
hardly merged. For simplicity, we regard the size of a
merged entity as the number of original and acquired corporations. This point may be also inappropriate to reality. Nevertheless, we obtain a heavy-tailed distribution:
Fig. 10(a) shows the chart of major banking company
mergers in the United States since the year 1900 [32].
Each link represents a merging event and the roots of the
trees represent current major banks in the United States.
In Fig. 10(b), we analyzed the distribution of the interval between two consecutive mergings, i.e. age a, which
indicates how long the bank has been sustained without
M&A. As in the birth-to-death age distributions of r-ER
and ER networks, the distibution is accumulated on a
node base. Each leaf node is regarded as a unit size. The
size of an intermediary node is defined as the number of
leaf nodes that it has acquired. We present an accumulated histogram in the direction of right to left. The distribution is heavy tailed and has an exponent near unity.
This result implies that the inter-merging age distribution of the major bank company mergers has a power-law
exponent near two.

birth-death process of ER and r-ER networks

Appendix F: Burst

Finally, we remark that in the limit g → 1, the rER model reduces to an ordinary ER model with τ =
5/2, σ = σ 0 = 1/2. So it is easily checked that the universal relation τ + σ = 3 is also satisfied in this limited case.

The number of nodes that inter-cross from one set to
the other increases as time proceeds. We denote it as
Nevent (t). Fig. 11(a) shows an intermediate range of time
where the ensemble averaged number of events follows a

10
power law in time, hNevent iens ∼ (tc − t)−1 . Fig. 11(b)
shows a corresponding power law observed in the ER
model in a range of subcritical time, where in the ER
model Nevent (t) is defined as total number of nodes in
the two clusters that merge at time t. Such a power law
behavior can be understood as follows.

Appendix G: Crackling noise

In this section, we consider the evolution of the largest
cluster in the system. At each time t, we measure m(t).
For a single configuration, it increases discontinuously
like a staircase with irregular steps. We are interested
in the distributions of the jump sizes and widths of the
staircase. To calculate these distributions, we consider
the continuous order parameter m(t) after taking the ensemble average and find the following empirical scaling
relation in the intermediate range of m.
m(t) ∼ (tc − t)−1/η ,

where q(mt ) denotes the probability that a giant cluster

the index t in the product should be increased by 1/N ,
and the size of the giant cluster at tc is N mtc ∼ O(N ) →
∞ in the thermodynamic limit. Numerically, we obtain
η ≈ 1, and thus Pw (∆t) ∼ 1/∆t, which is in agreement
with the simulation result in Fig. 13(d)−(f).
Next, we consider the portion of accumulation in
Pw (∆t) that is contributed during some limited time window [ta , tc ]. This marginal distribution decays exponentially, in agreement with the simulation results presented

Moreover, we also consider the jump distribution of the
staircase. For intermediate values of ∆m after ta , the
stair heights correspond to the giant cluster size increment. We find that the distribution of the giant cluster
size increment ∆m exhibits crossover behavior. Specifically, it has a power-law tail with an exponent of approximately 1.42 to 1.54 (Fig. 13(a)−(c)). The bump around
∆m ≈ 10−2 corresponds to the abundance of clusters of
size SA (ta ) at time ta .
From Eq. (G1), ṁ ∼ η −1 m1+η . From Fig. 13(d)−(f)
(orange data points), we find that P∆t decays exponentially. Thus, we regard P∆t as a constant and obtain
P∆m =

It is worth noting previous results: In an avalanche process such as k-core, and the Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld model
on ER networks, the duration of the avalanche P` ∼ `−1 ,
and the size of the avalanche scales as Ps ∼ s−3/2 . From
our result, we find that this is also the case. In fractional
percolation, multiplicative growth of the jump size has
induced Ps ∼ s−1 , and this was interpreted as indicating

during the avalanche process is not applicable to our

processes.

FIG. 5. Determination of ma for different g values. First, we determine ta as the intercept with the t axis of the tangential
line of m(t) at the inflection point of m(t). Then ma = m(ta ).

FIG. 6. Plot of ns and sτ ns versus s at various values of m. (a)−(c) Cluster size distribution ns (t) for g = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8
at t = ta and t = tc , which correspond to m = ma and mc , respectively. (d)−(f) A power-law behavior of ns is developed in
small-s region before ta and the region is elongated as time proceeds. Bump height seems to be maximum around ma , and as
time proceeds further, the right side of the bump is eroded as shown in zoom-in figures (g)−(i).

TABLE I. g is the control parameter representing the fraction of nodes contained in set A. τ ∗ and τ are the exponents of
the cluster size distribution at tc obtained from an analytic formula [27] and simulations, respectively. σ 0 is the exponent of
the characteristic cluster size sA . α and α0 are the exponents of the IET distribution in the time windows [0, tg ] and [ta , tg ],
respectively. δ1 and δ2 are the exponents of the jump size distribution for small and large ∆m, respectively. The exponents η
and ζ are associated with growth of the largest cluster.

FIG. 8. IET distributions accumulated in the time windows (a)−(f) [0, ta ] and (g)−(L) [ta , tg ] versus duration time z. The
exponent α is modified only slightly, depending on the direction of switching: (a)−(c), (g)−(i) PdA→B (z) and (d)−(f), (J)−(L)
PdA←B (z)

FIG. 9. In the g → 1 limit, the r-ER model reduces to the ER model which has ns (tc ) ∼ s−τ with τ = R5/2 at tc =
t
0.5 and σ = σ 0 = 1/2. By solving Smoluchowski equation of the ER model we find that (a) hns (t)it = t1c 0 c ns (t)dt ∼

is satisfied. Furthermore, regarding cluster merging of the ER model as a birthtc 0
death process we find that (b) the age distribution P (a) exhibits power-law decay with exponent close to 1. In the limit g → 1,
waiting time z can be interpreted as age a. In (b) we accumulate the age distribution of nodes in the merging clusters during
[0, tc ] and averaged over 104 independent configurations of finite size N = 105 of ER networks. (c) Distribution of merging
intervals P (a) in the r-ER model. g = 0.2 and N = 104 are taken. Data are collected during the time window [0, tg ] and from
103 samples.

FIG. 10. (a) Chart of major bank company mergers in the United states since 1900 [32]. (b) Accumulated histogram of the
weighted number of bank mergers Nacc versus age a in the unit of a year. Age is the length of an inter-merging period. Ages
of the merger and acquirer are collected after each mergers and acqusitions (M&A) event, and their occurences are weighted
by a representative size, defined as the number of leaf banks under each entity.

FIG. 11. Plots of nevents (t) ≡ Nevents (t)/N vs. tg − t for (a) the r-ER model with g = 0.2 and (b) the ER model. Each figure
shows an ensemble averaged curve over 103 samples. Both cases show a power-law behavior with exponent one.

FIG. 12. (a)−(c) Plot of m(t) versus tc − t to check m(t) ∼ (tc − t)−1/η . (d)−(f) Plot of ṁ/m versus m. (g)−(i) Plot of ∆m
versus m. The curves were averaged over 105 configurations. m(t) appears to follow a power law as m(t) ∼ (tc − t)−1/η in
the intermediate range of m, which corresponds to the jump region. The slope in (d)−(f) corresponds to the exponent η. In
(g)−(i), the data points averaged over 105 configurations are log-binned. The exponent ζ is measured in the intermediate range
of m, in which the order parameter increases dramatically. (a) ζ = 1.36, (b) ζ = 1.34, and (c) ζ = 1.30 for g = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8,
respectively.
