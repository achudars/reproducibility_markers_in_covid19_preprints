In ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, enormous magnetic fields are generated because of fastmoving charged particles. In the presence of these magnetic fields, the spin of particles is aligned
either in the parallel or in the antiparallel direction with respect to the direction of the magnetic
field. A finite magnetization is thus produced. It is known that a finite magnetic susceptibility, χm ,
changes the evolution of the energy density of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is believed
to be created in these collisions. Depending on whether the system under consideration is a
paramagnetic (χm > 0) or diamagnetic (χm < 0) fluid, it slows down or speeds up the decay of
the energy density, and affect other thermodynamic quantities. In general, one expects that the
magnetic susceptibility depends on the magnetic field and temperature. Bearing in mind that
these parameters evolve with the evolution of the fluid, a nonuniform magnetic susceptibility in
this system is thus expected. In this work, we first determine χm by using a certain analogy to the
standard anisotropic kinetic theory, where the one-particle distribution function is replaced by the
corresponding anisotropic distribution function. We then determine the proper time dependence
of the magnetic susceptibility in the framework of the ideal transverse magnetohydrodynamics.
We also study the effect of dissipation on the evolution of χm .

Proper time evolution of magnetic susceptibility in a magnetized quark-gluon plasma

S.M.A. Tabatabaee

1. Introduction
The recently observed polarization of Λ-particles at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
is related to the coupling of the spin of the constituent particles to the angular momentum of the
fluid [1]. This is, however, not the only source for the spin polarization. In these kinds of collisions,
extremely large magnetic fields are believed to be generated [2]. It is thus possible that the interaction of these fields with the spin of particles has an imprint on the polarization of particles. To study
the effect of magnetic field on this polarization, the anisotropy caused by a finite magnetization and
its evolution during the hydrodynamical stage are to be taken into account. In what follows, after
briefly introducing the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) setup, we use an analogy to anisotropic hydrodynamics, and determine, in particular, the proper time evolution of the magnetic susceptibility
by making use of a modified anisotropic one-particle distribution function in the framework of the
kinetic theory.

2. MHD setup
In the presence of external magnetic fields, an ideal magnetized fluid is described by a total
energy-momentum tensor [3]

(2.1)

where the fluid and electromagnetic energy-momentum tensors, T f

µ
= F λ F λ ν + gµν Fαβ F αβ .

(2.2)

Here, uµ , ε and p are the fluid four velocity, energy density, and pressure, Fµν and Mµν are
the field strength and magnetization tensors. Moreover, the auxiliary vector Πµ is defined by
[µ
Πµ ≡ 2uλ F ν M λ ]ν . For the sake of brevity, we use the symmetrization and antisymmetrization


symbols, A(µν ) ≡ 12 Aµν + Aν µ and A[µν ] ≡ 12 Aµν − Aν µ . Assuming an ideal fluid with infinite
conductivity, we neglect, in what follows, the electric field. In this case, the field strength tensor
and magnetization are expressed in terms of the magnetic field as
F µν = −Bbµν ,

M µν = −Mbµν ,

(2.3)

µ

with bµν ≡ ε µναβ bα uβ and bµ ≡ BB . The magnetic four-vector is thus given by Bµ ≡ 12 ε µναβ Fνα uβ ,
and is normalized as Bµ Bµ = −B2 . Once the electric field is assumed to be infinitely small, Πµ
µν
from (2.2) vanishes. In the absence of the auxiliary vector, T f is expressed as
µν

= (ε + p⊥ )uµ uν − p⊥ gµν + (pk − p⊥ )bµ bν ,

with p⊥ = p − BM and pk = p. In this forms, T f

(2.5)

that is introduced in the context of anisotropic hydrodynamics [4]. The only difference is that in
(2.5), the subscripts T and L correspond to transverse and longitudinal direction with respect to
the anisotropy direction êz , while in (2.4), the subscripts ⊥ and k correspond to transverse and
longitudinal directions with respect to the direction of the magnetic field. Moreover, whereas the
anisotropy in (2.5) arises due to viscous effects, in (2.4) anisotropies originate from the magnetization of fluid.
In the ideal MHD, the dynamics of the fluid and electromagnetic field is solely described by
the energy-momentum conservation, ∂µ T µν = 0, supplemented with the Maxwell equations,

∂µ F̃ µν = 0,

and

∂µ F µν = J ν .

(2.6)

Here, the dual field strength tensor is given by
F̃ µν = Bµ uν − Bν uµ .

(2.7)

Assuming the magnetic field to be initially aligned in the z-direction, and neglecting the transverse
expansion of the fluid, the homogeneous Maxwell equation leads to the proper time evolution of
the magnitude of the magnetic field [5, 6]
τ 
(2.8)
B = B0 0 ,
τ

with the proper time τ ≡ (t 2 − y2 )1/2 . Here, B0 = B(τ0 ) is the magnetic field at the initial time τ0 .
To derive (2.8), the Bjorken flow uµ = γ (1, 0, vy , 0) with vy = y/t is used. As it is shown in [5, 6],
(2.8) is a manifestation of the frozen flux theorem in the assumed ideal transverse MHD setup,
which also guarantees that the direction of the magnetic field is frozen, and does not evolve with
the expansion of the fluid.

3. Anisotropic MHD description of a nondissipative fluid
µν

To construct an energy-momentum tensor T0 = d k̃ k µ kν f0 which incorporates the magnetization, we introduce the one-particle distribution function [7]
 q

µ (0) ν
f0 = exp − k Ξµν k /λ0 .
(3.1)
Here, d k̃ ≡

R

and k µ and λ0 are the four-momentum of particles and the effective temperature,
(0)

respectively. Moreover, the anisotropic tensor Ξµν is given by
(0)

Ξµν ≡ uµ uν + ξ0 bµ bν ,

(3.2)

where ξ0 is the dynamical anisotropy parameter, induced by the magnetization of the fluid. In the
ideal transverse MHD, λ0 and ξ0 depend, in general, on the proper time τ and rapidity η defined
t+y
in transverse MHD. However, by the assumption of boost invariance, they become
by η ≡ 12 ln t−y
η independent. In the presence of an external magnetic field, f0 satisfies the Boltzmann equation
k µ ∂µ f0 + q f eF µν kν

∂ f0

∂ kµ

(3.3)

with q f e being the charge of various flavors f . Using the relaxation time approximation (RTA), we
set, as in [8],


f0 − feq
C[ f0 ] = −(k · u)
,
(3.4)
τr,0
with the equilibrium one-particle distribution function given by
feq = exp (−(k · u)/T ) ,

(3.5)

and the relaxation time τr,0 . In [8], the relaxation time is brought in connection with the shear
viscosity over the entropy density ratio. In ideal MHD discussed here, however, the fluid is dissipationless. The relaxation time τr,0 is thus only related to the magnetization of the fluid, that, because
of the induced anisotropy, affects feq .
Evolution of ξ0 and λ0
To obtain the evolution equation for ξ0 and λ0 , we use the method of moments of Boltzmann
equation (3.3). The zeroth and first moment of the Boltzmann equation lead to two coupled differential equation for ξ0 and λ0 ,

4. Anisotropic MHD description of a dissipative fluid
Determination of the dissipative part of the one-particle distribution function, shear, and
bulk viscosities
To determine the dissipative part of the one-particle distribution function, we start by plugging
f = fb + δ fd , including the nondissipative and dissipative one-particle partition functions, fb and
δ fd , into the Boltzmann equation
k µ ∂µ f + q f eF µν kν

with Ξµν = uµ uν + ξ bµ bν . Moreover, λ and ξ are the effective temperature and anisotropy parameters, that are, in contrast to λ0 and ξ0 from previous section, affected by the dissipation of the
fluid. To determine δ fd , we follow the method that has been used in [9]. We use rank-two tensors

Figure 1: (a) The τ dependence of the anisotropy function ξ0 (nondissipative case) and ξ (dissipative case)
is plotted for relaxation times τr,0 (blue solid curves) and τr (black dashed curves) equal to 0.3 fm/c. The
anisotropy parameter decreases in the early stage, and rises slowly after few fm/c. This qualitative behavior
does not change once the fluid is assumed to be dissipative. (b) The τ dependence of the effective temperature
λ0 (nondissipative case) and λ (dissipative case) is plotted for relaxation times τr,0 (blue solid curves) and τr
(black dashed curves) equal to 0.5 fm/c. The effective temperature decreases, and a finite dissipation does
not affect its qualitative behavior too much.

and using M0 = χm0 B. The same method is used to determine χm from ξ and λ , arising from
(4.15), in the dissipative case. According to the results from Fig. 1, finite dissipation strongly
affects the anisotropy parameter, while the effective temperature remains almost unaffected by
the inclusion of dissipation. As concerns the τ dependence of the magnetic susceptibility in Fig.
2, it increases in the early stages after the collision, for 0.2 < τ < 1.5 fm/c [see Fig. 2(a)], or
equivalently at temperature 400 > T > 180 MeV [see Fig. 2(b)], and then decreases with increasing
τ , or equivalently with decreasing temperature. The qualitative T dependence of χm in the range
T ∈ [100, 200] MeV is comparable with the lattice QCD results [11], where, in contrast to our
result, χm continues to increase with increasing temperature. The fact that χm increases from a
zero initial value at T = 400 MeV to a maximum at T ∼ 200 MeV is related to the creation of
large magnetic fields in the early stages of the collision in this temperature regime. Let us notice
that, in contrast to lattice results, the magnetic field considered in the present work is dynamical.
Assuming, that in the most simplest case B decays as B ∼ τ −1 , the decay of χm after reaching the
maximum at T ∼ 200 MeV becomes understandable.

Figure 2: (a) The τ dependence of the magnetic susceptibility χm,0 (nondissipative case) and χm (dissipative
case) is plotted for the initial magnetic field eB̄ = 5m2π and relaxation times τr,0 (red solid curves) and τr
(black dashed curves) equal to 0.3 fm/c. (b) Using T = T0 (τ0 /τ )1/3 , arising from the Bjorken solution,
with the initial temperature T0 = 400 MeV and the initial time τ0 = 0.5 fm/c, the τ dependence of χm is
converted into its T dependence. The red solid and black dashed curves demonstrate the T dependence of
χm,0 (nondissipative case) and χm (dissipative case) for the initial magnetic field eB̄ = 15mπ2 and relaxation
times τr,0 (red solid curves) and τr (black dashed curves) equal to 0.5 fm/c, respectively. Here, mπ = 140
MeV. In the regime T ∈ [100 − 200], the T dependence of the magnetic susceptibility coincides qualitatively
with lattice QCD results [11]. The qualitative behavior of χm,0 as well as χm at T ∈ [200, 400] MeV can be
brought in relation to the creation and the fast decay of the magnetic field at the early stages of the collision
with T ≈ 400 MeV.
