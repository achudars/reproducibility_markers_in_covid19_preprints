MAGIC is a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes located on the Canary
Island of La Palma and dedicated to the study of very high energy gamma rays above 30 GeV.
MAGIC has recently demonstrated its capability as a neutrino detector, by exploiting the Earthskimming technique. The neutrino-event selection has been studied by pointing the telescopes
towards the sea a few degrees below the horizon, with no pre-defined source direction. An upper
limit to the ντ flux was set. In this work, a follow-up strategy of given source directions is presented. This new approach is characterised by pointing to targets passing through the sea window
observable with MAGIC and for which a trigger from dedicated neutrino observatories is issued
with large significance. Above a few tens of PeV, the acceptance of MAGIC to ντ is considerably large and compelling results can be obtained for transient events of short duration. The
performance of this new method is tested on a sample of data collected by pointing MAGIC for
a few days from March to May 2016 towards the direction of a multi-PeV neutrino that IceCube
detected on June 11th 2014 (reconstructed direction (J2000.0) RA: 110.34◦ and Dec.: 11.48◦ ). A
selection cut is studied in order to discriminate τ-lepton-induced air showers from the background
of very inclined cosmic-ray-induced air showers. An upper limit on the neutrino flux from the
above given neutrino direction is presented.

MAGIC as a high-energy tau-neutrino detector

1. Introduction
High-energy and ultra-high energy neutrinos are unique cosmic messengers: they are a probe
of hadronic mechanisms at work in cosmic-ray sources and they do not suffer magnetic deflections,
pointing to their production site. Neutrinos are expected to be produced by astrophysical accelerators mostly through the charged pion decay. In a low density environment, the flavour ratio at the
source is therefore (νe :νµ ντ )∼(1:2:0). Because of neutrino oscillations and according to standard
production scenarios, an equal flavour ratio is expected at Earth .
The IceCube experiment provided the first strong evidence for the existence of a flux of astrophysical neutrinos of energies between about 100 TeV and 1 PeV [1]. In addition, its measurements are
consistent with equal fractions of all flavours [2, 3]. However, up to now astrophysical ντ have not
been unambiguously tagged. The detection of neutrinos of this flavour would be of fundamental
importance from both the astrophysics and particle physics point of view, being an additional proof
of the cosmic origin of these particles and a clear sign of neutrino oscillations, which can shed light
on physics beyond the standard model.
Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) are able to detect ντ , by using the so-called Earthskimming method [4]. Up-going neutrinos interacting close to the Earth surface can produce
charged leptons. A τ-lepton arising from a ντ propagates through the Earth. If it emerges and
decays in the atmosphere, it induces an air shower that can be measured through IACTs [5].
MAGIC is a stereoscopic IACT system focused on the study of the gamma-ray universe between
about 50 GeV up to 50 TeV [6]. Even if not designed nor optimised for measuring in Earthskimming mode, MAGIC set an upper limit on the ντ flux in the PeV-EeV energy range by pointing
the telescopes to fixed azimuth and zenith (Az -30◦ , Zd 92.5◦ ) [7].
In this work, we present the analysis of the data collected by pointing MAGIC in Earth-skimming
mode towards a multi-PeV IceCube event detected on June 11th 2014 (reconstructed direction
(J2000.0) RA: 110.34◦ and Dec: 11.48◦ )[8, 9], called: IceCube-140611A. In Section 2, the strategy for analysing candidate neutrino sources with MAGIC is presented: the cuts for selecting the
ντ -signal are discussed, and the acceptance and the expected event neutrino rate are calculated. In
Section 3, we apply our analysis on IceCube-140611A data, setting an upper limit on the flux of ντ
from this direction. The aim of this work is to implement a tool that can be used for following-up
transient events in Earth-skimming mode, in case of alerts issued with a large significance from
dedicated neutrino observatories.

2. Search for Earth-skimming neutrinos from transient events with MAGIC
The MAGIC telescopes are able to point down to 6◦ below the horizontal plane and, thanks
to their location, have the right distance from the Atlantic Ocean for potentially observing a full
development of τ-lepton-induced air showers emerging from the sea [5]. The τ decay length is
about 0.5 (50) km, for an energy of 1 (1000) PeV. Fig. 1 (left panel) shows a sketch of an up-going
τ-lepton-induced air shower produced by a ντ . The horizon seen by MAGIC is reported in Fig. 1
(right panel): in particular, the region highlighted by the red rectangle is considered optimal for the
observations in Earth-skimming mode. The zenith and azimuth ranges are respectively [90◦ - 95◦ ]
and [-100◦ -20◦ ].

Figure 1: Left panel: sketch of ντ -detection in Earth-skimming mode. Right panel: horizon seen by the
MAGIC telescopes. The rectangle highlights the optimal neutrino visibility window. The azimuth range
between 0 and -20◦ is excluded because of the shadowing from the telescope access tower (see text for more
details).

The effective area of MAGIC for this kind of observations was calculated analytically. For an
observation angle of 1.5◦ below the horizon, it ranges from ∼103 m2 at 100 TeV to 6×104 m2 at
300 PeV, reaching 5×105 m2 at 100 EeV [10].
A search for neutrinos in Earth-skimming mode has been already carried out with MAGIC. It was
performed with about 30 h of data collected by pointing the telescopes below the horizon towards
a fixed position (Az -30◦ , Zd 92.5◦ ). A 90% C.L. upper limit on a hypothetic ντ point-source flux
of E 2 Φ(E)<2.0×10−4 GeV cm−2 s−1 was obtained in the PeV-EeV energy range [7].
The predicted emission of neutrinos above PeV from candidate astrophysical sources is quite low
(see e.g. [11]). The MAGIC sensitivity in Earth-skimming mode is limited mainly by the available
observation time. However, the perspectives become appealing in case of short bursting episodes
with high luminosities extending to the highest energies, like in case of flaring Active Galactic
Nuclei or Gamma-ray Bursts. These objects can exhibit electromagnetic outbursts of duration
significantly shorter than months [12]. For this reason, pointing MAGIC to potential sources of
neutrinos in case of triggers from dedicated observatories like IceCube can significantly improve
the probability of detecting ντ .
2.1 Monte Carlo simulations
In order to study the signal expected from an up-going ντ , a full Monte Carlo simulation chain
was set up in [5, 7], based on a modified version of ANIS [13], CORSIKA (6.99)[14] and the simulation of the response of MAGIC. The simulations have been performed from 1 PeV to 1000 PeV
in steps of 0.33 PeV, and for a zenith angle of 87◦ . Even if this analysis is focused on events with
zenith angles larger than 90◦ , this is not a major issue: a previous work demonstrated the universal
behaviour of the parameters used for identifying τ-lepton-induced air showers at large zenith angles above 80◦ [5, 7].
The expected signature in the MAGIC camera depends on the different decay channels of the τlepton, that mainly decays to hadrons, pions and kaons and in 35% of the cases to electrons and

muons. In this work, the simulations are used for defining the selection parameters of τ-leptoninduced air showers, for studying the identification efficiency (Sec. 2.3) and for evaluating the
acceptance of MAGIC (Sec. 2.4). Mainly because of the camera FoV (3.5◦ ×3.5◦ ), MAGIC observes a portion of the atmosphere even when it points below the horizon. The main background
to a possible neutrino signal is therefore due to very inclined cosmic rays. In the PeV-EeV energy range, these are especially protons. A comparison between τ-lepton-induced air showers and
proton-induced air showers has been carried out at MC-level [5]. In general, a τ-lepton-induced air
shower will contain many more Cherenkov photons with respect to a proton-induced air shower of
same energy, mainly because its decay vertex is closer to the detector.
2.2 MAGIC observations
Two main datasets were collected between 2015 and 2016 in Earth-skimming mode, i.e. by
pointing MAGIC towards the window highlighted by the rectangle in Fig. 1 (right panel). They are
shown in Table 1. The sample called SeaON was mainly taken during nights characterised by high
cumulus clouds, preventing normal gamma-ray observations. SeaON data have been analysed, but
no neutrinos have been identified [7]. For this reason, in this work, these data are used as a background sample for the optimisation of the selection cuts for short-time observations, as described in
more detail in Sec. 2.3. The data named IceCube-140611A were instead collected for a few days in
2016, by pointing MAGIC towards the direction of a multi-PeV IceCube neutrino detected on June
11th 2014 [8], and tracking it when it was passing through the ντ visibility window. The effective
duration of the observations was 1.34 h.
2.3 Optimisation of the selection cuts and trigger efficiency study
It is possible to discriminate τ-lepton-induced air showers from the background of very inclined cosmic ray-induced air showers by considering two Hillas parameters of the cleaned camera
image: the Size and the Length [15]. The first one expresses the total amount of light in the camera, measured in photoelectrons, and it is correlated with the primary energy; the second quantity
describes the lateral development of a shower and it is measured in degrees. Fig. 2 (left panel)
shows a scatter plot of Size and Length: black points are SeaON data, whereas blue points are from
MC simulations of τ-lepton-induced air showers at 1 PeV. Only showers with impact distances d <
300 m have been selected, for a better reconstruction of the camera image. The figure shows that
a region in the 2D Length-Size plane can be defined that is strongly signal-dominated. The region
can be separated by a single cut, by projecting the plane along the direction:
log10 Y = log10 (Size) × cos α − log10 (Length) × sin α

with α = 63◦ . The corresponding projected distributions are shown in Fig. 2 (right panel). In [7], a
cut at log10Y =2.35 was set, shown by the red line in Fig. 2. In case of short-duration observations
(one-hour time scale), as those here proposed, we expect a smaller background contamination,
therefore a reduced cut strength [16]. In particular, the cut has been optimised by studying a Model
Rejection Factor (MRF) defined as:
MRF =

hµ 90 (nb )i
ns

(2.2)

where hµ 90 (nb )i is the average 90% C.L. upper limit [18], nb is the number of SeaON data re-scaled
to one hour observation time and surviving to log10 Y cut, ns is the number of MC τ-lepton-induced
air showers after the cut. nb and ns are shown in Fig. 3 (left panel) as a function of the log10 Y cut.
The MRF is shown in Fig. 3 (right panel) for different MC energies. A method for reconstructing
the primary energy of up-going τ-lepton showers has not been implemented yet, however, the figure
shows that the cut does not depend on it. This is due to the fact that the log10 Y distributions exhibit
a universal behaviour, with a negligible dependence on energy and also zenith angle [7]. The
log10 Y cut value has been chosen to minimise the ratio between the upper limit setting capability
and the expected neutrino signal after the cut. In particular, we set the cut at log10Y =2.1. The cut
has been studied also for larger d and we found that it can be relaxed, down to log10Y =1.9, because
of a further reduction of the background.
The MC signal efficiency is around 80%, this value is however largely reduced when one considers
the trigger efficiency. We estimated it on MC simulations, including the MAGIC response. It is
defined as the ratio between the number of simulated showers with positive trigger decision and
the total number of showers at generation level. It depends on the energy Eτ of the τ-lepton, on the
distance r between the τ decay vertex and the detector, and on the impact distance d. The latter
has been randomised in CORSIKA and also over the MAGIC camera FoV [7]. The total efficiency
(trigger+log10Y cut) ranges between 5% and 20%, depending on Eτ and on r: in particular, it is
larger for larger energies and smaller r. The identification efficiency should depend also on the
zenith angle of the shower, but this dependence is negligible for θ >83◦ , as demonstrated in [13].

2.4 Acceptance and event rate calculation
In order to estimate the neutrino flux from a given source, it is necessary to know the detector
acceptance, i.e. the ratio between the number of reconstructed events Nrec and the number of generated events Ngen . In particular, the point-source acceptance APS for MAGIC has been evaluated
as follows:
N
∑ FoV cut Pi (Eντ , Eτ , θ ) × σi (θ ) × εeff,i (Eτ , r, d)
APS (Eντ , θ , φ ) = i=1
.
(2.3)
Ngen
Pi (Eντ , Eτ , θ ) is the probability that a neutrino of given energy Eντ and zenith θ produces a τ-lepton
of energy Eτ . σi (θ ) is the cross-section evaluated for an interaction volume given by a cylinder of
radius 50 km and height 10 km. The calculation takes into account the density profile of the Earth
and a water layer of thickness of 3 km (for more details see [13]). εeff,i (Eτ , r, d) is the trigger+cut
efficiency described above. NFoV cut is the number of τ-leptons with decay vertex inside the MAGIC
FoV. The acceptance of MAGIC is shown in Fig. 4 between 1 PeV and 100 EeV. The dashed line
corresponds to the acceptance evaluated with the cuts adopted in [7], whereas the solid line is the
acceptance evaluated in this work, showing an improvement by a factor ranging between 1.8 and

2, depending on the energy. The performance of MAGIC is compared to IceCube. The points in
Fig. 4 show the effective area of IceCube evaluated for the online through-going track (”EHE”)
selection at the most favourable conditions (in energy and direction) [17]. The total number of
expected signal events has been finally evaluated by considering the flux prediction evaluated for
the AGN PKS 2155-304 in high-state activity as a benchmark flux [19], and the acceptance shown
in Fig. 2.4 (solid line). The resulting expected event rate is ns =1.4×10−4 /3h. The systematic
uncertainties of the event rate are related to the neutrino-nucleon cross section and to the τ-lepton
energy loss. They range between 10% and 40% as shown in [7].

3. Analysis of IceCube-140611A with MAGIC
The analysis described above has been applied on IceCube-140611A observations. About 1.34
hours of data were collected by following the source when it was passing in the optimal neutrino
visibility window. The observations have been performed in standard observation mode, usually
adopted for gamma-ray sources. The number of reconstructed stereo events with MAGIC pointing
below the horizon (Zd>90◦ ) and here selected is 3643. The Size- and the Length-parameters of

those data are shown in Fig. 5 (left panel). The corresponding log10 Y distribution are reported in

The neutrino flux upper limit has been calculated at 90 % C.L. as follows:

µ 90 C.L. (nb , nobs )
× Φ(Eντ ),
ns

(3.1)

where µ 90 C.L. (nb , nobs )=2.44, as no candidate neutrino events are observed and Φ(Eντ ) is a reference spectrum. We assume Φ(Eντ )=10−8 E−2 GeV−1 cm−2 s−1 . Since ∆T=1.34 h, the 90% C.L flux
limit on IceCube-140611A is therefore:
E 2 Φ90 C.L. < 4 × 10−4 GeV cm−2 s−1 .

4. Conclusions
In this work, we have investigated the capabilities of MAGIC as a high-energy neutrino detector. MAGIC can observe neutrinos in the PeV-EeV energy range, through the Earth-skimming
channel, by discriminating the τ-lepton signal from the background of very inclined cosmic rays.
An upper limit on the flux of neutrinos from the direction of IceCube-140611A has been calculated.
Even if the sensitivity of MAGIC is limited by the short observation time, we have demonstrated
that for energies above ' PeV its acceptance is comparable to (or larger than) IceCube effective
area (the latter being evaluated in the most favourable conditions [12]). For neutrino sources with
hard spectra and short outbursts (up to week time scales), MAGIC data-taking in Earth-skimming
mode can therefore potentially complement the observations by conventional neutrino telescopes,
especially if the observations are performed following a trigger issued by dedicated experiments
like IceCube.
