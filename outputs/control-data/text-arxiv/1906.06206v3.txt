Quantum devices, such as quantum simulators, quantum annealers, and quantum computers, may be exploited to solve
problems beyond what is tractable with
classical computers. This may be achieved
as the Hilbert space available to perform
such ‘calculations’ is far larger than that
which may be classically simulated. In
practice, however, quantum devices have
imperfections, which may limit the accessibility to the whole Hilbert space. We thus
determine that the dimension of the space
of quantum states that are available to a
quantum device is a meaningful measure of
its functionality, though unfortunately this
quantity cannot be directly experimentally
determined. Here we outline an experimentally realisable approach to obtaining
the required Hilbert space dimension of
such a device to compute its time evolution, by exploiting the thermalization dynamics of a probe qubit. This is achieved
by obtaining a fluctuation-dissipation theorem for high-temperature chaotic quantum systems, which facilitates the extraction of information on the Hilbert space
dimension via measurements of the decay
rate, and time-fluctuations.

1 Introduction
The ability to control and manipulate microscopic systems at the single particle level is an essential requirement for many quantum technologies. Experimental setups where atoms or qubits
can be arranged in ordered structures and studied
in quantum non-equilibrium states include neutral atoms in optical lattices [1–3], trapped ions

[4–7], Rydberg atoms [8, 9], and superconducting
circuits[10, 11]. These systems can be used for
the quantum simulation of many-body models,
or different forms of digital or adiabatic quantum
computing. Most of these physical setups have
limitations in the accessibility to certain observables. Thus, having extra tools to characterize
quantum systems in a simple and efficient way
can be useful in the diagnosis and certification of
quantum devices.
One of the most prominent properties of a
quantum device is its size in terms of the dimension of the associated Hilbert space. The
size of a quantum computer or simulator is often given in terms of number of qubits, such that
the Hilbert space dimension is 2N for N qubits.
This is a measure that ignores the effect of disorder or the possible lack of connectivity between
different zones in the device.
A more useful quantity would be the number
of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian that take part
in the quantum dynamics, which is bounded in
this case by 2N , but would exclude the degrees of
freedom that do not contribute to the evolution of
the initial state. Thereby establishing an effective
Hilbert space dimension that more accurately describes the complexity of the system, in terms of
some effective fully connected Hamiltonian. This
Hilbert space dimension is, however, an elusive
measure in realistic experimental situations.
In this work we show that the equilibration dynamics [12–18] of a quantum system can be used
to extract such information on the dimension of
the Hilbert space of a quantum device, in terms
of the effective number of states that contribute
to the dynamics of a local observable. Indeed,
advancements in quantum technologies described
above have inspired a bounty of theoretical work
in the field of quantum thermalization [19–30]. In
the following, we aim to help ‘bridge the gap’ between theoretical and experimental work in this

field [31].
We assume a quantum quench scenario [8, 21,
28, 32] in which a quantum system is initialized
in a fully-decohered, infinite temperature state,
except for a subsystem that acts as a sensor and
is prepared in a pure state. For simplicity, we assume that this subsystem is a single qubit, which
we refer to as the ‘probe’ qubit. The relaxation
dynamics of the probe qubit depends on the details of the underlying structure of the Hamiltonian, however, in the most generic case of nonintegrable systems, an appropriate description
can be given in terms of random matrix theory
(RMT) [25, 30, 33–38]. We show that the timefluctuations of the probe in the long-time limit
contain information about the Hilbert space dimension of the device.
Our article is structured as follows. Firstly,
in Section 2 we present the basic scheme and
summarize our main result, which relies on an
infinite-temperature fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT) [39] for the dynamics of the probe
qubit in order to extract information on the scaling of the effective Hilbert space of a quantum device. We continue, presenting numerical calculations that validate our predictions via exact diagonalization of a spin chain Hamiltonian in Section
3. We then outline in more detail our RMT model
in Section 4. In Section 5 we derive an expression
for the time dependence of generic observables in
chaotic quantum systems, and discuss how this
can be exploited for our measurements. We then
derive the FDT, and extensions from the RMT
model, and to finite temperatures, in Section 6.
Finally, we summarise our findings in Section 7.
Further details and proofs are included in Appendices. We note that this is arranged such that
our key findings can be understood from sections
2 and 3, with the detailed calculations presented
later in the text.

2 Setup and main results
2.1 Proposed setup
We assume that we have a quantum system (from
here on, ‘quantum device’) made up of a single
‘probe’ qubit, initialized in a pure state, which at
t = 0 is coupled to the rest of the quantum device
(referred to as the ‘bath’). We initialize the bath
in an infinite temperature state. This is sketched
in Figure 1. This can be routinely achieved, for

Figure 1: Illustration of our proposed setup (quantum
device). A single qubit, labelled ‘Probe’, is coupled locally to a part of a larger non-integrable bath, initialized
in an infinite temperature state ρB ∼ Iˆ (this restriction
is removed below). Experimentally, for our protocol, one
needs access only to an observable of the Probe qubit.

example, in a quantum computer device that has
not been properly initialized. Since quantum devices always suffer from some kind of decoherence, creating an infinite temperature (or fully
decohered) state is typically a simple task. We
then let this qubit evolve in time and reach an
equilibrium state. The initial state is thus,
ρ(t = 0) = | ↑ih↑ | ⊗ ρB .

(1)

ρB is the density matrix of the bath in the fully
decohered state,
ρB =

(2)

where |φB,αB i is a set of orthonormal wave functions in the bath, which we take as the eigenstates
of the bath Hamiltonian HB . NB is the Hilbert
space dimension of the bath, and is the parameter on which we wish to infer information via
measurements of the probe qubit. Later on the
fully decohered state condition will be relaxed,
allowing for finite temperatures.
The system evolves under the interacting
Hamiltonian,
H = H0 + V,
(3)
where H0 = 1̂ ⊗ HB is the Hamiltonian of the
uncoupled probe + bath device, and we assume
that the probe qubit does not evolve at all in the
absence of coupling to the bath, which is given by
the operator V . A prominent role in the following
discussions will be played by the eigensystems of

H|ψµ i = Eµ |ψµ i,

(4)

and the eigensystem of the uncoupled probe-bath
system
H0 |φα i = Eα(0) |φα i.
(5)
All throughout this work we will use the convention that indices µ, ν refer to summations over
eigenstates of H, whereas α, β refer to eigenstates
of H0 .
We focus on the quantum dynamics of the expectation value of a probe observable, which we
take for concreteness to be hσz (t)i = Tr(ρ(t)σz ).
Note that, however, the results should not depend on the particular choice for the probe observable, since H0 has no probe energy term. The
probe-bath coupling V , may introduce a dependence on the chosen observable, but the results
below should hold in the general case of quantum
chaotic or non-integrable systems.
The quantity under study, the time-averaged
fluctuations of the probe observable, is defined

where µσz (T ) = T1 0T dthσz (t)i.
Assuming
only that the many-body eigenenergies are nondegenerate, and that also their energy gaps are
non-degenerate, we may express the time fluctuations in terms of matrix elements between eigenstates of the coupled probe-bath system [25],

2.2 Summary of main results of this work
In many practical situations the quantum device
is a non-integrable, quantum chaotic system. We
expect that in such cases a qualitative description
can be obtained by assuming that V is a random
matrix. This assumption leads to a statistical
theory for the many body wave functions in Eqs.

of the device. We will refer to cµ (α) as quantum chaotic or random wave functions. We assume that V belongs to the Gaussian Orthogonal
Ensemble (GOE), appropriately scaled by a coupling strength g. In Ref. [40] we showed that this
model can be solved and it allows us to calculate
matrix elements in the interacting basis.
Special care must be taken to translate the
probe initial state defined in Eq. (1) in the random matrix formalism. Without loss of generality we can assume that non-interacting eigenfunctions are ordered such that odd (even) values of α
correspond to the probe qubit in state | ↑i (| ↓i).
This leads to the initial condition
ρ(t = 0) =

(9)

In the following sections we prove that random matrix theory leads to a relation between
the time-fluctuations and the typical decay rate
of the probe qubit. This relation is the main result of this work:
δσ2z (∞) = χ(N )Γ−1 ,

(10)

inverse decay rate of the qubit. This average is
an unbiased average over all initially populated
initial state energies, which spans the entire energy range ∆E of the device due to the initial
infinite temperature bath state. We will see that
this unbiased average originates from the decay
to equilibrium of each state |φα i contributing to
the initial state (9). In Sections 5 and 6 we will
see that this can be related to the decay rate obtained from a fit to the decay to equilibrium of a
local probe observable in our current set up. This
quantity is thus simply an average of the decay
rates experienced by the probe qubit.
The quantity χ(N ), with N the total number
of qubits, depends on the size of the system in
the following way,

(11)

D(E) is the average density of states (DOS) of
the system, defined analogously to the average
decay rate above (see also Eq. (61)). NB is the
bath Hilbert space dimension, and finally, C is
a constant of order one that does not depend on
the size of the system or coupling strength.

Eq. (10) can be understood as a fluctuationdissipation relation, which relates the timefluctuations in the steady-state with the decay
rate after a quantum quench. The ratio between
fluctuations and average decay time allows us to
quantify the dimension of the Hilbert space over
which the ergodic quantum dynamics takes place.
In a physical system if V couples the probe qubit
to the whole spectrum of the quantum device, we
expect that the function χ ∝ ecNB , where NB is
the number of qubits in the part of the device
that acts as a bath.
Our main result, Eq. (11), can be obtained by
following these steps:
(i) We consider the random matrix model with
an homogeneous coupling matrix V , and calcu2 (∞) by extending the formalism developed
late δO
in [40, 41] to mixed states (see Section 6.1). To
carry out this calculation we assume a constant
DOS, D(E) = 1/ω0 , with ω0 the mean energy
separation.
This calculation allows us to predict an exponential decay for a probe observable of the form:
hO(t)i = (hO(t)i0 − ODE )e−2Γt + ODE ,

(12)

where ODE is the diagonal ensemble of the observable O, which we find to be equal to the long-time
average of O as required, and hO(t)i0 refers to
the free evolution of the observable O under the
Hamiltonian H0 . This result is derived in Section
5. This is analogous to the result in Reference [41]
for pure-states. We note that the same Equation
has similarly been obtained in Ref. [35], which
allows also for the perturbation matrix V to be
inhomogeneous. In the specific case of interest
here, Eq. (12) becomes,
hσz (t)i = e−2Γt ,

(13)

as hσz (t)i0 = 1 and hσz iDE = 0.
Using this random matrix model we also obtain
a preliminary version of the infinite temperature
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, Eq. (11), with
χ(N ) = Cω0 /NB .
(ii) In a realistic system both the DOS and
the coupling strength will depend on the energy.
This leads to energy-dependent qubit decay rates,
Γ(E), and DOS, D(E). Due to the infinitetemperature initial condition, it is not possible
a priori to approximate those quantities to any
single value, since the quantum dynamics of the
Accepted in

probe qubit result from contributions from all
possible initial states. It is thus necessary to extend the RMT formalism to allow for variations
in both the DOS and the decay rate in energy
over the width of the initial mixed state.
It is also important to note that when applied
to a realistic system NB should be thought of as
the number of eigenstates that may contribute to
the dynamics of a local observable - it is thus a
measure of the effective Hilbert space dimension
in the sense of the number of degrees of freedom
that may be explored from a given initial state.
This measure accounts for effects such as locality
of interactions, and disorder, which will reduce
the Hilbert space available for evolution of the
system. As such, NB will in general be bounded
by the total Hilbert space dimension, but is a
more realistic measure of the size of the explored
Hilbert space in the thermalization dynamics of
the device.
In Section 5 we show that the decay rate observed from such an initial state, defined with an
energy dependent coupling strength, is the thermal average decay rate over the energy width defined by the initial state.
We formulate the generalization of the FDT in
Section 6.2, however a brief summary of the approach is as follows: To account for the energy
variation of the DOS and decay rate we instead
make the assumption that both change slowly in
energy with respect to the energy width of a single eigenstate. In this case, one can reformulate
the theory such that the random wave functions
have a smoothly varying width. In effect this is
the statement that a given random wave function contributes as if it was the eigenstate of a
random matrix model with a constant DOS and
decay rate, as over the width of the wave function
itself these parameters do not change appreciably.
In this case, we see that the average DOS
and decay rate over the initially populated initial
states contributes to the FDT, as in Eq. (10).
This is extended to finite temperature systems,
where instead a thermal average can be seen to
contribute, in Section 6.3.
Finally, we may relate the two decay rate averages, as the thermal average observed from the
decay differs slightly from that appearing in Eq.
(10). These can be seen to be related by a constant factor that does not depend on the coupling
strength, or bath size, and thus scaling informa-

tion of the Hilbert space dimension may be recovered. This is shown in Section 6.3, and Appendix
E, where the FDT is recast in terms of thermal
averages.
In Section 5 we show that when an exponential
decay of the form Eq. (12) is observed, this indicates that Γ(E) is approximately constant over
the bulk of the initially populated states. In this
case we are able to extract the numerical value
of the Hilbert space dimension directly, as the
averages ove Γ(E) occurring in the FDT, and observed from the decay, are equal.
In summary, we observe the emergence of a
classical fluctuation-dissipation theorem, relating
the time-fluctuations and decay rate of our probe
observable σz . The susceptibility χ(N ) in Eq.
(11) can be seen to be related to the Hilbert
space dimension of the bath, NB , and thus measurements of the decay rate, Γ, and fluctuations
δσ2z (∞), which are both obtainable from the time
evolution, can be exploited to obtain information
on the device Hilbert space dimension, NB .

3 Numerical Experiments
Before going into the technical details of our
derivation, we present numerical evidence that
confirms the validity of the random matrix approach and our main results. In this section, we
show the application to a spin-chain system using exact diagonalization [42, 43]. From this, we
observe the FDT numerically using a realistic experimentally observable model.
In Fig. 2, we show the manifestation of Eq.
(10) in a spin-chain system described by the
Hamiltonian H = HS +HB +HSB , where HS = 0
is the system Hamiltonian (acting as our probe),
HB is our bath Hamiltonian, given by

which acts on sites with index > 1, which is the
probe index. The probe and bath are coupled by

coupling strength, for many bath sizes N − 1 (labelled
on plot). Fits (blue dashed lines) shown for each value
of N , are linear fits to obtain χ(N ) for each individual

Here Nm is the device site where the probe is
coupled, which we set as 2 throughout. This spinchain model may be related to the random matrix
toy model, H = H0 + V , via the prescription
H0 ⇔ HS + HB , and V ⇔ HSB . In particular,
δ 2 (∞)
we see that, as χ(N ) = O −1 ∝ NB−1 , we expect
Γ
that if all of the available Hilbert space is being
utilized in the unitary dynamics we will observe
the following scaling:
χ(N ) ∝ e−cNB .

(16)

This is the relation that we test in Fig. 3.
It is important to note that this exponential
scaling of χ(N ), Eq. (16), is expected from not
only the contribution of NB , but also from the
average DOS, D(E). This average is often trivially obtained, as for example, forR an ensemble of
∆E

dED(E) =

∆E , where ∆E is the range of energies available Emax − Emin (which may itself change
with N ), regardless of the microscopic properties of the DOS. We thus also study the quantity
χ(N )D(E), as this quantity has no dependence
on the DOS, and an observation of the exponential scaling in system size is confirmation that,
indeed, NB ∝ ecN . This is shown in Fig. 4,
where we observe an exponential scaling of the
Hilbert space dimension, with c ≈ 0.62, compared

infinite temperature case, β = 0, and thus confirms the
exponential scaling of χ(N ). In this case, we observe an
exponential scaling for all temperatures, as the average
DOS also scales exponentially with N . Note that here

explored in the dynamics.
We further observe in Figs. 3 and 4, that
the FDT similarly applies at finite temperatures
β = kB1T > 0. The extension of our theoretical
approach to this case is discussed below, with additional details given in Appendix E. Indeed, we
can show that for high temperatures, such that
β −1  Γ, we obtain an FDT of the same form
as Eq. (10), by employing a high energy cut-off
(ρB )αα ∼ e−βEα to the bath state occupation.
For finite temperatures we show below that the
FDT depends on the partition function Zβ itself,
rather than the Hilbert space dimension. Indeed,
one can see that in the infinite temperature limit
P
Z0 = limβ→0 α e−βEα δα,odd = NB .
Finally, we see that when the observable is
found to decay exponentially to its equilibrium
value, this indicates that the decay rate is approximately constant over the bulk of the initially occupied states. This is shown in Section
5. Exploiting this observation, we are able to directly obtain the Hilbert space dimension, as for
an infinite temperature initial bath state the average Γ−1 is equal to the measured decay rate.
The bath Hilbert space dimension NB , as calculated from Eq. (10), is plotted for varying deAccepted in

(yellow dashed line) is performed to the function ae N0
for the infinite temperature case, β = 0, and thus confirms the exponential scaling of χ(N )D(E) ∼ N1B . In
this case, we observe an exponential scaling for only
high temperatures, and confirm that for low temperatures χ(N )D(E) is independent of N . Note that here
we have Γ ∼ 0.2 so the high temperature limit is defined

vice sizes in Fig. 5. Here we observe that NB
indeed increases exponentially with systems size,
yet is somewhat smaller than its maximum possible value 2N −1 , which is expected to the locality
of interactions within the chain.
We again note that in Fig. 5 the measurement
of NB is a measurement of the explored Hilbert
space, or the total number of eigenstates that contribute to the evolution of the initial state. Thus,
for a maximally connected device this would be
2N −1 , whereas locality of interactions in this case
restricts some areas of the Hilbert space.
We note that for models where Γ(E) is not approximately constant in energy, which would be
marked by a deviation from the exponential decay in Eq. (12), one would still have access to
Figs. 2-4, and thus scaling information of the
Hilbert space dimension, yet the numerical value
NB would be obscured. This is explained in more
detail in Section 5, where we see how information
on Γ(E) is extracted from the decay, and in Section 6 and Appendix E, where we see how this
relates to the observed FDT. The key detail is
that when the FDT is expressed in terms of the
same value measured from the decay it differs by
a constant, thereby leaving the scaling of NB with

Our approach relies on the calculation of correlation functions from a statistical theory of random
wave functions cµ (α). Here we summarize the essential ingredients to our model, and give details
on the calculations in the sections below.
Our theory, developed in Ref. [40] by extending Deutch’s RMT model [44–46], can be
used to obtain arbitrary correlation functions
hcµ (α)cν (α) · · · iV , where h· · · iV denotes the ensemble average over an ensemble of random matrix perturbations, V , for a N × N Hamiltonian
of the form (3), with (H0 )αβ = αω0 δαβ , with
ω0 = N1 and V a random matrix selected from the

2 i =
. In practice, those
GOE, with hVαβ

correlations allow us to calculate any dynamical
quantity of interest within the RMT formalism.
To illustrate the use of such correlation functions we briefly consider the simple example of
the diagonal observable matrix elements Oµµ .
These can be written as

Oµµ =

X

cµ (α)cµ (β)Oαβ .

(17)

Now, using the self-averaging property of random
matrices, which we prove for this model in Appendix C, we see that
Oµµ =
system size or decay rate accessible, yet obscuring
the numerical value.

We note that in Ref. [41], the current authors
obtained a FDT for pure states, which can be
seen to be recovered in the low temperature limit,
β −1  Γ, for which χ(N ) does not depend explicitly on the Hilbert space dimension NB . This can
also be analytically seen to be the same as the low
temperature limit of our treatment below, which
indicates that there is a smooth transition between these two cases. This is indeed observed in
the numerics of Figs 3 and 4.

hcµ (α)cµ (β)iV Oαβ .

(18)

αβ

Note that only the random wave functions cµ (α)
remain inside the ensemble average, as all other
factors are in the non-interacting basis and thus
do not depend on V . We thus observe that the diagonal observable matrix elements depend on the
correlation function hcµ (α)cµ (β)iV (note that we
will see how to deal with the summation and noninteracting observable elements in Section 4.3 below).
More generally, when calculating more complicated quantities, we have that there is also a nontrivial contribution of a four-point correlation
function of the form hcµ (α)cν (β)cµ (α0 )cν (β 0 )i
which is given by (for µ 6= ν),

with Γ = Nπgω0 . Λ(2) (µ, ν) is defined similarly to
Eq. (20b), with Γ → 2Γ. The Lorentzian form
of Eq. (20) is found for a homogeneous perturbation V [40, 45], selected from the GOE. We obtain that the four-point correlation function, Eq.
(19), can be described in terms of product of twopoint correlators Λ(µ, α), as if the random wave
function distribution was purely Gaussian, plus a
correction term originating from the effective interaction due to the mutual orthogonality of random wave functions. We will see below that an
approach in terms of Gaussian and non-Gaussian
contractions can be formulated to describe more
general correlation functions.
We note that our theory can be extended to account for different forms of the quantum chaotic
wave function Λ(µ, α). This may appear, for example, for non-homogeneous V . In this case, the
form of the function Λ would change, however the
algebraic structure of our theory would remain.
In order to evaluate Eq. (7), we thus use
2 (∞) in terms of the ranEq. (8) to write δO
dom wave functions cµ (α), and non-interacting
matrix elements ραβ and (σz2 )αβ . We then use
the self-averaging property of random matrices
(which we discuss in A, and prove in Appendix
C), and obtain the relevant correlation functions
hcµ (α)cν (β) · · · iV .

4.2 Computing Correlation Functions
As we have seen, it is important to have a systematic approach to obtaining correlation functions for this model. This is a non-trivial task
as the random wave functions of our theory are
not Gaussian independent variables, but include
an effective interaction due to the orthogonality
condition hψµ |ψν i = δµν [40]. Our approach to
the statistical theory of random wave functions is
summarized in Appendix A.
Below, we present such a systematic approach
to obtaining arbitrary correlation functions in

terms of contractions representing the Gaussian
and non-Gaussian terms in the four-point correlator (which is the largest non-factorizable correlation function of our theory).
The four-point correlation function of Eq.
(19) may be understood in terms of the contractions of non-interacting indices, indeed
it can be seen to be the sum of a Gaussian

We reserve the double line contraction notation
of Eq. (21) for the non-Gaussian case. Note that
these must occur in pairs of contractions between
different interacting indices µ 6= ν.
Now, we can see from Eq. (21) that each contracted pair of indices contributes a Kroneckerδ symbol, and thus, when the correlation function is summed over its non-interacting indices,
the number of summations is reduced. We see
that as each Λ contributes a factor on the order O( ωΓ0 ), and a summation on the order O( ωΓ0 ),
a reduced summation will act to render a term
negligible in comparison to a term with no such
reduction. Further, we see that the contribution of the non-Gaussian term Eq. (22) is of orω3
der O( Γ03 ), whereas that of the Gaussian term is
ω2

∼ Λ2 , and thus O( Γ02 ), and as such, one can see
that for the non-Gaussian contractions to contribute, they must be acted on my an extra summation. Indeed, one can see that this occurs for
one of the two non-Gaussian terms when one has
repeated summations, i.e. α0 , β 0 → α, β in Eq.
(21).

For further details we refer the reader to Ref.
[41], and the calculations in Appendices B and
C. Here we have seen the key intuition, however: that repeated indices in correlation functions leads to the dominant contribution of contractions that would otherwise have contracted
the pair of equal indices.

4.3 Assumptions on Observables
After obtaining the relevant correlation function,
one needs to perform the summations over remaining indices. See, for example, the simple
case of Eq. (18) above. To perform the summations, certain assumptions on the form of observable matrix elements in the non-interacting
basis must be made. We note that in this basis,
local system observables are usually of a known
form.
Our theory relies on assumptions that we expect to be satisfied for such local observables.
The key assumption is related to the behaviour of
matrix elements, which must have a well defined
average, that does not vary pathologically with
energy. A more formal definition of our assumption can be written in terms of the function Λ,
as,
X

Λ(µ, α)Λ(ν, α)Oαα = [Oαα ]µ Λ(2) (µ, ν), (23)

α

with Eµ :=

Eµ +Eν
,
2

and

[Oαα ]µ =

X

Λ(µ, α)Oαα .

(24)

α

We will see that this assumption will be necessary
in order to compute summations over the noninteracting indices. In this section we explain in
more detail the requirements on the form of Oαα
for Eq. (23) to be valid, as well as the physical
interpretation of the assumption.
The essential assumption here, which we label
smoothness of Oαα , as in Ref. [41], is that the microcanonical average [Oαα ]µ changes slowly over
the width Γ of the function Λ(µ, α)Λ(ν, α). We
showed in Ref. [41] that this is the case under the
assumptions,
Γ
 1,
ω0
d2
Γ2 2 [Oα,α ]µ  1,
dEµ

2. The microcanonical average changes slowly
over the width Γ.
We note that the latter condition, combined with
the fact that the microcanonical average and time
average are equal (which is shown below), is
equivalent to the statement that the time-average
of the observable is not sensitive to the particular
initial state (microstate), rather, it’s macroscopic
energy. In fact, one can see that the conditions
(25) are precisely those required in order to define a microcanonical average that does not vary
pathologically with small changes in the energy
window. In this sense, this assumption is the minimal assumption one would expect to require for
thermalization to a microcanonical average that
changes smoothly with initial state energy to occur.
We further note that in the consideration of
time evolution below, we will consider more general observables that are not necessarily diagonal
in the non-interacting basis, but fulfil a sparsity
P
condition. This can be written as αβ Oαβ =
P PNO
n Oα,α+n δβ,α+n , where for a given obα
servable there is a non-extensive number NO of
groups of non-zero matrix elements at given energy widths, such that after the course graining procedure the observable matrix elements are
non-zero for energy gaps Eα −Eβ that are the possible energy gaps of HS . This form can be seen
[41] to be reasonable for local observables. We
note that it is of course possible to find observables that do not fulfil this assumption, although
it is easily seen to be true for e.g. local Pauli
operator observables. We will see below that our
treatment of time evolution could potentially also
capture a wider range of observables as well, if
the form in the non-interacting basis is known.
In the following we refer to observables fulfilling
the above assumptions as ‘generic’ observables.

This is the same as that obtained in Reference

The approach outlined above is valid assuming
that the decay rate Γ is constant in energy. In
fact, for the system under consideration, we have
to allow Γ to change with the initial state energy,
such that Γ → Γα (note that here the change in
DOS does not affect the calculation). Accounting
for this, rather than Eq. (34), we obtain

where we have used in the second line that ODE =

inverse temperature β, and we have defined Γα as
the decay rate of the initial state |φα i. We thus
see that it is the thermal average of the inverse
decay rate that is measured by a fit to the time
dependence of an observable.
The integral form of the thermal average of a
function A(E), is given by,

α

Now, for our system we have that, as HS = 0,
the microcanonical average [Oαα ]µ = 0 for all µ
in the bulk of the spectrum. Also, using that
for our proposed experimental protocol, both the
initial state and observable are diagonal in the
non-interacting basis, we have

with Zβ0 := 0∆E dED(E)e−β(E−E0 ) . We will see
below that the FDT will be initially expressed in
terms of a different average over the values Γ(E).
This difference is resolved in Appendix E, where
we re-express our FDT in terms of the thermal
average above. We show that the form differs
only by a constant that is independent of N and
the coupling strength, and thus the scaling with
Hilbert space dimension remains the same, and
this difference is not important for our application.
Finally, we note that when Γα ≈ Γ is approximately constant across the bulk of the initially populated initial states, the thermal average above is approximately equal to the unbiased
average appearing in (10). We also see that in
this case, from Eq. (40), one expects to observe
an exponential decay at the rate Γ, as in Eq. (13).
Indeed, this is what we observe in our numerical
example in Section 3 above, and thus we are able
to recover the Hilbert space dimension directly
in Fig. 5. If a non-exponential decay is observed,
then the average hhΓ(E)−1 iiβ is obtainable via integration as above, and the scaling of the Hilbert
space dimension is still obtainable as in Fig. 4.

We begin be writing the initial density operator
matrix elements as,

6.1 Derivation from RMT

ρµν =

Here we perform the full derivation of the FDT
for the random matrix model described above.
We initially focus on the case of a diagonal initial bath state ραβ = wα δαβ . We then restrict
the treatment to the specific protocol outlined in
Section 2, where the initial state is the product of
a single probe qubit in a pure state, and a bath
in an infinite temperature state, see Eq. (9). We
will follow a very similar steps as those outlined
in the previous section, however we will see here
that the correlation function calculation is somewhat more complicated.
The RMT model here is limited to the case of
constant decay rate and DOS, we will thus extend
the treatment to more realistic cases in the next
section.
We are interested in the calculation of the longtime fluctuations, defined by the diagonal ensemble result,

where coefficients of the initial state are labelled
as unprimed indices α, β, and coefficients of the
observable are labelled by primed indices.
Using the self-averaging property of random
matrices (see Appendices A and C), we may replace the product of coefficients cµ (α)cν (α) · · ·
by their ensemble average hcµ (α)cν (α) · · · iV ; the
above expression may then be written in terms
of a sum over 8-point correlation functions,
weighted by the initial state and observable coefficients wα and Oαα :

that there are three dominating contributions to
the fluctuations, given by,

and for finite temperatures.

6.2 Extension to Realistic Systems
The key issue with directly applying the RMT
results to realistic models is that in general the
DOS, and decay rate, are energy dependent, and
thus change over the width of the initial state
distribution (this is especially important for the
high/infinite temperatures considered here). In
order to account for this, we must then go back
to the evaluation of the integrals over energy,
in Eq. (55), and substitute Γ → Γ(E), and
ω0−1 → D(E). This is justified under the assumption that neither Γ(E), nor D(E), vary appreciably over the width Γ. i.e. Γ(E)−Γ(E+Γ(E))
 1,
Γ(E)
and D(E)−D(E+Γ(E))
 1.
D(E)

hold, that is, as long as they change sufficiently
slowly over the energy width Γ. The contribution
of each eigenstate Λ(µ, α) to the fluctuations at
a given energy is then that of a local (in energy)
random matrix model, with a constant DOS and
decay rate. D(E) and Γ(E) can then be allowed
to change over an energy much wider than a the
width of Λ(µ, α), as over such energy widths the
contributions of relevant eigenstates are independent.
Now, we further define ω = Eµ − Eν , and make
the change of variables Eµ , Eν → ω, E, and thus

constant that depends on the functional form of

Γ(E) is approximately constant over the width of
the DOS, which is often the case in such systems
(in fact from Eq. (40) this can be seen to be the

observed), then the biased and unbiased thermal
averages of Γ(E)−1 are approximately equal for

that obtained from a fit to the decay. We may
fix this problem directly, as we do in the last section, where we see that the unbiased thermal averages may be replaced by regular thermal averages weighted by the DOS at the expense of a

Therefore, we can directly relate the measured inverse decay rate hhΓ(E)−1 ii0 to the time-averaged
fluctuations, and from measurement of each for
changing device size or coupling strength, as
shown in the numerical experiments of Section
3, yields information on the scaling of the Hilbert
space dimension. We finally note that it is simply the lack of direct knowledge of the constant
Cβ0 which prevents measurements where there is
a non-negligible change in the decay rate with
energy (a non-exponential decay to equilibrium)
from constituting a direct measurement of the
value of the Hilbert space dimension. This constant depends on the functional form D(E) and
Γ(E), and thus, if these are known, inference of
the Hilbert space dimension itself is thus obtainable.
Finally, we note that the finite temperature approach above can be extended to the low temperature regime, as shown in Appendix E, from
which we can recover the pure state FDT found
in Ref. [41] in the low temperature limit.

7 Discussion
The results shown above demonstrate how the
chaotic dynamics of thermalization may be exploited in order to gain information on the complexity of the unitary quantum dynamics of a system. We have proposed an experimentally viable
protocol, by which measurements of a local observable of a probe qubit may be exploited to
measure the Hilbert space dimension of an ergodic quantum device, initialized in an infinite
temperature state. We note that this measures
the dimension of the states directly involved in
dynamics only, and thus provides a more accurate
measure of the complexity of the dynamics than
a simple estimate of the Hilbert space dimension
from the number of qubits. In this sense, such a
measurement of a large enough quantum device,
if shown to be ergodic in the sense outlined above,
would be a convincing indicator of the so called
‘quantum supremacy’ of the quantum device.

For cases where an exponential decay to equilibrium is observed, which we show implies that
the decay rate is constant over a large range of
energies, our method allows the experimenter to
access the numerical value of the Hilbert space
dimension itself, not simply its scaling with size
or coupling strength. This can be obtained from
a single time trace of the decay to equilibrium
of the observable, from the measurement of the
decay rate, and fluctuations around equilibrium.

On a practical level, for a generic nonintegrable Hamiltonian, our results may be observed in two ways: measurement of a probe
observable for (i) changing the number of
qubits/ions/... in the quantum device (as in Figs.
3 and 4) , or (ii) changing the probe-bath coupling
(as in Fig. 2). The latter is perhaps the simplest
experimental methodology, which we show can
confirm the ergodic behaviour of a system, that
is, that the unitary dynamics requires an extensive proportion of the Hilbert space, by showing a
linear relationship between the long-time fluctuations and decay rate. For a model where the device size may be altered, our FDT provides even
deeper insight, allowing also for the experimental observation of the scaling of the Hilbert space
dimension with system size.

A Summary of RMT Approach
A.1 Random Matrix Model
The random matrix model under study may be expressed by a non-interacting part
(H0 )αβ = Eα δαβ

(75)

where Eα = αω0 , and ω0 = 1/N is the spacing between energy levels, and perturbation term, modelled
by a random matrix,
Vαβ = hαβ ,

(76)

where hαβ are independent random numbers selected from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE),
and rescaled by a coupling strength g, such that the matrix h has the probability distribution,

giving hhαβ i = 0, and hh2αβ i = g 2 /N for α 6= β, and otherwise hh2αα i = 2g 2 /N .

where the δ-function term explicitly accounts for the orthogonality of the many-body eigenstates (which

where in the second line we have re-expressed the δ-functions in their Fourier form. The superscript

discussed below. The correlation functions may then be calculated by performing successive derivatives
with respect to the force terms ξ via

We stress here that the generating function Eq. (79) explicitly requires µ 6= ν, as it models the
interactions due to mutual orthogonality of two random wave functions. For the diagonal part, we
have the much simpler generating function,

Figure 6: (a) Numerical confirmation of the random matrix FDT for an infinite temperature initial state, Eq. (118)
for observables Oodd and Osym . (b) Shows the random matrix FDT for a high temperature initial state β = 100, and
(c) for a low temperature (β = 500). Here g = 0.04, so Γ ∼ 0.007, and thus the high temperature limit β  Γ−1 is
approximately β  125. We thus observe that the finite temperature result Eqs. (62) and (115) (which we note are
equivalent, the latter is used here), is fulfilled for all temperatures. We note that the low temperature limit above
uses ρB ∼ e−β(E−E0 ) , with E0 = Emax
2 , to ensure that the initial state is not simply the ground state. For this limit
we also use WO = [∆O2 ], as discussed in the final section. Simulations are performed with a single realization of
the random matrix V , and thus we observe directly the self-averaging property.

A.2 Self-Averaging
A final property we exploit is that of the self-averaging of random matrices, specifically, in summations
we make the assumption that the observable time dependence and fluctuations are equal to the ensemble
average over perturbations V , such that hO(t)i ≈ hhO(t)iiV . This has been previously checked for
this model numerically in Refs. [40, 41], and can also be seen to be valid numerically in this case
from Figs. 6 and 7, which compare our analytical calculations to single realizations of the random
matrix Hamiltonian. Self-averaging is a common tool in RMT [47], and whilst examples of behaviour
that violates a self-averaging assumption indeed exist [48, 49], these are generally due to additional
constraints preventing such statistical behaviour, for global observables such as the survival probability,
or in more exotic regimes e.g. close to critical points [50, 51].
A recent and timely study [48] has looked in detail at the self-averaging behaviour of multiple
quantities for both a full GOE, and a realistic spin chain, finding that in general one should be wary
of simply applying self-averaging. It is shown, for example, that the survival probability is not selfaveraging at any timescale. Indeed, the current authors have recently shown that this quantity cannot
be expected to behave ergodically, and thus RMT should not apply to the survival probability [49].
In the light of such studies, as well as such counterexamples to self-averaging outlined above, it is
important to further justify the use of this property in more detail.
The definition for self-averaging used in [48] is that the vanishing of the quantity
RO (t) =

hhO(t)i2 iV − hhO(t)ii2V
,
hhO(t)ii2V

(85)

as the system size increases. Indeed, a very similar quantity was bounded for this RMT model in Ref.
[35]. In Appendix C, we will show that self-averaging in the sense of the vanishing of Eq. (85) indeed
occurs for our model using the assumptions on observables outlined above.
We further note that as the realistic Hamiltonians of interest are not necessarily disordered, in
the sense that they themselves may have no random component, we do not require that they be
self-averaging themselves (indeed this has no real meaning in this case). Rather, the assumption in
our case is that when expressed in that non-interacting basis, a chaotic interaction Hamiltonian is
suitably ‘random’, such that it resembles a single realization of the ensemble we describe above, which
itself is self-averaging. In fact, it is not important that the entire interaction Hamiltonian resembles

an element of this ensemble, we require instead that locally, for any energy E within the bulk, the
interaction Hamiltonian resembles an element of the random matrix ensemble within a width ∼ Γ from
E.

A.3 RMT Numerics
Here we confirm our analytical results with numerical calculations with the random matrix Hamiltonian. In particular, we show in Fig. 6a, that the infinite temperature fluctuation-dissipation theorem
(FDT),

(86)

is satisfied in this model. This is shown for two ‘observables’ of the RMT model, Oodd and Osym , which
are chosen to be diagonal in the non-interacting basis, with diagonal elements given by,
(

(Oodd )αα =
for Oodd , and

0 otherwise,
(

(Osym )αα =

1 if α = odd

−1 otherwise,

(87)

(88)

for Osym . These observables are chosen, as in Refs. [40, 41], as they resemble realistic observables,
such as local Pauli operators, in the sense that they are well defined, sparse, and highly degenerate
[29] in the non-interacting basis. For our RMT numerical calculations, we define the initial state as
ραβ = e−β(Eα −E0 ) δαβ δα,odd ,

(89)

such that hO(0)i = 1. The energy shift E0 is simply to avoid edge effects at lower temperatures, where
a large fraction of the initial state population would otherwise be in the ground state.
In Fig. 7 we plot the time dependence of the above observables for an infinite temperature initial
state, and compare these to the observable time dependence of Eq. (37), derived below.
The high temperature limit, in which our FDT is derived, is defined by β −1  Γ. In the numerics,
we use g = 0.05, and thus Γ ∼ 0.007, so the high temperature limit requires β . 125. We show plots
for β = 100 and β = 500 in Figs. 6b and 6c, respectively. For the parameters used these correspond
to a high temperature, near the edge of the expected limit, and a low temperature initial state. We
observe that the finite temperature form in fact works well for all β values. This is further discussed
analytically in the final section below, where we see that the low temperature limit of our current
approach is equal to the pure state result previously obtained in Ref. [41].

B Gaussian, Non-Gaussian, and Mixed Contractions
Here we calculate the contributions to the long-time fluctuations of Eq. (47). We see that the relevant
correlation function is an 8-point correlation function, which we will show below may be split into
three groups: products of Gaussian contractions, products of non-Gaussian contractions, and mixed
products of two Gaussian and one non-Gaussian contraction.
An example of the first form, Gaussian contractions only, is
hcµ (α)cν (α)cµ (β)cν (β)cµ (α0 )cν (α0 )cµ (β 0 )cν (β 0 )iV = Λ(µ, α)Λ(ν, α)Λ(µ, α0 )Λ(ν, α0 )δαβ δα0 β 0 .

(90)

Indeed, there are three such contractions, occurring each time between pairs of indices, that only
contribute two kronecker-δ factors - ∼ δαβ δα0 β 0 , δαα0 δββ 0 , δαβ 0 δβα0 . Other Gaussian contractions may
be defined, but may be ignored due to a reduction in the number of summations.

lines) show time evolutions for a single realization of the random matrix perturbation V . RMT calculation (dashed
lines), show Eq. (37), with hO(t)i0 = 1, and hOiM C = [Oαα ] = 0(0.5) for O = Osym (Oodd ). Parameters used are
N = 500, g = 0.05, β = 0, 100.

In a similar manner, we may define non-Gaussian contractions that do not reduce the number of
summations at all, such that they contribute on the same order as the Gaussian contractions above.
An example is,

It can be easily seen that there are three non-Gaussian contractions of this form, with the other two
being defined by swapping pairs of primed and unprimed indices in turn.

C Proof of Self-Averaging
In addition to the numerical demonstration in Figs. 6 and 7, we are now able to analytically demonstrate that self-averaging, in the sense of Eq. (85), occurs for this model. We have already obtained
hhO(t)iiV in Section 5 (note that here we assumed self-averaging, and thus simply used the notation
hO(t)i, in the current section we require the self-averaging step to be explicit, so use the angle brackets
h· · · iV whenever self-averaging is performed), and thus, what remains is a calculation of hhO(t)i2 iV .
We can do this by writing,
∆O(t)2 =

from which, we see that the relevant correlation function after self-averaging is hcµ (α)cν (β)cµ (α0 )cν (α0 +
n)cµ0 (α1 )cν 0 (β1 )cµ0 (α10 )cν 0 (α10 + n1 )iV . Indeed, the contribution from Gaussian contractions can easily
be seen to be identical to that of h∆O(t)i2V , as these correlators only contract identical interacting
indices µ, ν. Furthermore, we see that when non-Gaussian contractions are defined between primed
and unprimed interacting indices, µ, ν, there is a reduction in the number of summations. For example,
we compare the contribution

and observe that the latter contribution is negligible, due to the extra reduced summation, as there are
no repeated non-interacting indices within the non-Gaussian contraction. We note that the dominating
contribution from non-Gaussian contractions is inevitably from the n, n1 = 0 term shown above (as
this reduced summation does not change the order of the contribution as NO  N ). Thus we have
a single dominating contribution given by the 4-point correlation functions defined with primed, or
unprimed, interaction indices only:

where we see once more that the n, n0 = 0 terms dominate, and that contractions between the primed
and unprimed indices induce additional kronecker-delta factors, and thus are negligible.
Thus, we have that R = 0 (see Eq. (85)), and we analytically observe self-averaging in this model.
We note here that in the derivation of the 4-point correlator, we assume that the only ‘interactions’
between the eigenstates themselves are those enforced due to the mutual orthogonality of eigenstates
P
via the condition α cµ (α)cν (α) = δµν [40]. As these interactions occur pairwise between eigenstates,
correlation functions with more than two interacting indices µ, ν contribute an additional δµν .

we proceed by defining,

similarly, this is the case for our application studied in the main text, where Oαβ ∼ δαβ . We note that
the condition of diagonal wαβ correspond to a reasonable initial state in many experimental situations,
since thermalization takes place typically by incoherent exchange of energy in the basis of eigenstates
of H0 . For states with coherences, to bound this quantity we require that the coherences are not large

In this sense, ‘special’ initial states may be chosen that do not satisfy this bound, but they are highly

that is that we may write αβ Oαβ = α N
n Oα,α+n δβ,α+n , is only used above in bounding |A(t)|,
the other terms are more general. As noted above, whilst this form is reasonable for generic local
variables [41], one may of course be able to build observables that do not match this form, in which
case, one may either have an additional contribution due to A(t), or be able to arrive at a similar
bound.

E FDT in terms of Thermal Averages
In this section, we show that the FDT may be recast in terms of the thermal averages hh· · · iiβ , obtained
from the a fit to the decay, shown in Sec 5. We begin by re-expressing our finite temperature FDT in
terms of the thermal averages,

hhA(E)iiβ := 0

Z ∆E

(113)

with Zβ0 := 0∆E dED(E)e−β(E−E0 ) , where we have introduced the low-energy cut-off E0 , which is the
energy of our zero temperature pure state. The addition of this cut-off ensures that, for non-zero E0 ,
the initial state is not the ground state of the bath at zero temperature.
To include this thermal average, we return to Eq. (70), and note that,

We finally note here that it is the measurement of a thermal average of the decay rate, and not the
unbiased average, that obscures the direct measurement of NB , such that in general a FDT of the
form of Eq. (120) would be observed experimentally. We thus limit our claim in cases where the
energy dependence of the decay rate is important (which, as can be seen from Eq. (40), is implied by
a non-exponential decay to equilibrium, due to multiple contributing decay rates) to the experimental
verification of the finite size scaling of the Hilbert space dimension, rather than the particular value of
NB , without additional assumptions or the numerical calculation of Cβ0 .

E.1 Low Temperature FDT

We see that in the zero temperature limit wα ∼ δαα0 , and thus, the averages in Eq. (97) contribute
to a lower order as the number of summations is reduced for terms with, e.g. wα wβ , over terms with,
2

e.g. wα2 . This can be seen to lead to [wα ]µ  [wα2 ]µ . Similarly, both terms above with mixed averages

[wα Oαα ]µ contribute on the order [wα ]µ , as [wα Oαα ]µ = [wα ]µ O↑ . Using only the remaining terms, we
have that,

so,
as required.
We recall that until Eq. (67), no assumptions on the initial state or observable are made other than
the ability to define the required microcanonical averages. As such, taking the low temperature limit
at this point, as we have done above, does not contradict any assumptions made.
