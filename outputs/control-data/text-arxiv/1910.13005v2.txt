Abstract. We introduce twisted Steinberg algebras over a commutative unital ring R.
These generalise Steinberg algebras and are a purely algebraic analogue of Renault’s twisted
groupoid C∗ -algebras. In particular, for each ample Hausdorff groupoid G and each locally
constant 2-cocycle σ on G taking values in the units R× , we study the algebra AR (G, σ)
consisting of locally constant compactly supported R-valued functions on G, with convolution and involution “twisted” by σ. We also introduce a “discretised” analogue of a twist Σ
over a Hausdorff étale groupoid G, and we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between locally constant 2-cocycles on G and discrete twists over G admitting a continuous global section. Given a discrete twist Σ arising from a locally constant 2-cocycle σ
on an ample Hausdorff groupoid G, we construct an associated twisted Steinberg algebra
AR (G; Σ), and we show that it coincides with AR (G, σ −1 ). Given any discrete field Fd ,
we prove a graded uniqueness theorem for AFd (G, σ), and under the additional hypothesis
that G is effective, we prove a Cuntz–Krieger uniqueness theorem and show that simplicity
of AFd (G, σ) is equivalent to minimality of G.

1. Introduction
Steinberg algebras have become a topic of great interest for algebraists and analysts
alike since their independent introduction in [34] and [10]. Before Steinberg algebras were
specified by name, they appeared in the details of many groupoid C∗ -algebra constructions,
such as those in [14, 19, 20, 28]. Not only have these algebras provided useful insight into
the analytic theory of groupoid C∗ -algebras, they give rise to interesting examples of ∗algebras; for example, all Leavitt path algebras and Kumjian–Pask algebras can be realised
as Steinberg algebras. Moreover, Steinberg algebras have served as a bridge to facilitate
the transfer of concepts and techniques between the algebraic and analytic settings; see [5]
for one such case.
Thirty years prior to the introduction of Steinberg algebras, Renault [30] initiated the
study of twisted groupoid C∗ -algebras. These are a generalisation of groupoid C∗ -algebras
in which multiplication and involution are twisted by a T-valued 2-cocycle on the groupoid.
Twisted groupoid C∗ -algebras have since proved extremely valuable in the study of structural properties for large classes of C∗ -algebras. In particular, work of Renault [31], Tu [35],
and Barlak and Li [3] has revealed deep connections between twisted groupoid C∗ -algebras
and the UCT problem from the classification program for C∗ -algebras. For more work on
twisted C∗ -algebras associated to graphs and groupoids, see [2, 4, 11, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 33].
Given the success of non-twisted Steinberg algebras and the far-reaching significance
of C∗ -algebraic results relating to twisted groupoid C∗ -algebras, we expect that a purely
algebraic analogue of twisted groupoid C∗ -algebras will supply several versatile classes of
∗-algebras to the literature, as well as a new avenue to approach important problems in
C∗ -algebras.

Throughout, let R be a discrete commutative unital ring with units R× . Let Cd denote the
ring of complex numbers endowed with the discrete topology, and let Td denote the complex
unit circle endowed with the discrete topology. In this article, we introduce the notion of
a twisted Steinberg algebra AR (G, σ) constructed from an ample Hausdorff groupoid G and
a locally constant R× -valued 2-cocycle σ on G. Our construction generalises the Steinberg
algebra AR (G), and provides a purely algebraic analogue of the twisted groupoid C∗ -algebra
C ∗ (G, σ) in the case where R = Cd .
In the non-twisted setting, the complex Steinberg algebra and the C∗ -algebra associated
to an ample Hausdorff groupoid G are both built from the convolution algebra Cc (G) of
continuous compactly supported complex-valued functions on G. The complex Steinberg
algebra A(G) is the ∗-subalgebra of Cc (G) consisting of locally constant functions, and the
full (or reduced) groupoid C∗ -algebra C ∗ (G) (or Cr∗ (G)) is the closure of Cc (G) with respect
to the full (or reduced) C∗ -norm (see [32, Chapter 9]). It turns out (see [10, Proposition 4.2])
that A(G) sits densely inside of both the full and the reduced C∗ -algebras. Therefore, the
definition of a twisted complex Steinberg algebra should result in the same inclusions; that
is, the twisted complex involutive Steinberg algebra should sit ∗-algebraically and densely
inside the twisted groupoid C∗ -algebra. However, to even make sense of that goal, one must
first choose between two methods of constructing a twisted groupoid C∗ -algebra. The first
involves twisting the multiplication on C ∗ (G) by a continuous T-valued 2-cocycle σ, and
was introduced by Renault in [30].
In [30], Renault also observed that the structure of a twisted groupoid C∗ -algebra with
multiplication incorporating a 2-cocycle σ could be realised instead by first twisting the
groupoid itself, and then constructing an associated C∗ -algebra. This is achieved by forming
a split groupoid extension
G(0) × T ,→ G ×σ T  G,
where multiplication and inversion on the groupoid G ×σ T both incorporate a T-valued
2-cocycle σ on G, and then defining the twisted groupoid C∗ -algebra to be the completion
of the algebra of T-equivariant functions on Cc (G × T) under a C∗ -norm. A few years later,
while developing a C∗ -analogue of Feldman–Moore theory, Kumjian [18] observed the need
for a more general construction arising from a locally split groupoid extension
G(0) × T ,→ Σ  G,
where Σ is not necessarily homeomorphic to G × T. It turns out that when G is a secondcountable ample Hausdorff groupoid, a folklore result (Theorem 4.10) tells us that every
twist over G does arise from a T-valued 2-cocycle on G.
Therefore, our first task is to define twisted Steinberg algebras with respect to both
notions of a twist. This is the focus of Sections 3 and 4. In Section 3, we define the twisted
Steinberg algebra AR (G, σ) by taking an ample Hausdorff groupoid G and twisting the
multiplication of the classical Steinberg algebra AR (G) using a locally constant R× -valued
2-cocycle σ on G. We then show that ACd (G, σ) sits densely inside the twisted groupoid C∗ algebra C ∗ (G, σ). In Section 4.3, we give an alternative construction of a twisted Steinberg
algebra built using a twist Σ over G, and then verify that these two definitions of twisted
Steinberg algebras agree when the twist over G arises from a 2-cocycle.
In order to construct a twisted complex Steinberg algebra using a twist over a groupoid,
we are forced to first “discretise” our groupoid extension by replacing the standard topology
on T with the discrete topology. Though this may seem a little artificial to a C∗ -algebraist,
this change is indeed necessary, as we explain in Remarks 4.20. (Nonetheless, this should
not come as too much of a surprise, given the purely algebraic nature of Steinberg algebras.) Thus, Section 4.1 is dedicated to introducing these discretised groupoid twists and
establishing in this setting the aforementioned folklore result for an arbitrary commutative

unital ring R (Theorem 4.10). Then in Section 4.2, we flesh out the relationships between
these twists over groupoids and the cohomology theory of groupoids.
Section 5 provides several examples of twisted Steinberg algebras, including a notion of
twisted Kumjian–Pask algebras. The final two sections of the paper are devoted to proving
several important results in Steinberg algebras in the twisted setting, when R is a (discrete)
field. In Section 6 we prove a twisted version of the Cuntz–Krieger uniqueness theorem for
effective groupoids (Theorem 6.1), and we show that when R is a discrete field and G is
effective, simplicity of AR (G, σ) is equivalent to minimality of G (Theorem 6.2). Finally,
in Section 7, we show that twisted Steinberg algebras inherit a graded structure from the
underlying groupoid, and we prove a graded uniqueness theorem for twisted Steinberg
algebras (Theorem 7.2).
2. Preliminaries
In this section we introduce some notation, and we recall relevant background information on topological groupoids, continuous 2-cocycles, and twisted groupoid C∗ -algebras.
Throughout this article, G will always be a locally compact Hausdorff topological groupoid
with composable pairs G(2) ⊆ G × G, range and source maps r, s : G → G, and unit space
G(0) := r(G) = s(G). We will refer to such groupoids as Hausdorff groupoids. For all γ ∈ G,
we have r(γ) = γγ −1 and s(γ) = γ −1 γ, where multiplication (or composition) of groupoid
elements is evaluated from right to left. We write G(3) for the set of composable triples in
G; that is,
G(3) := {(α, β, γ) : (α, β), (β, γ) ∈ G(2) }.
For each x ∈ G(0) , we define
Gx := s−1 (x),

Gx := r−1 (x),

and

Gxx := Gx ∩ Gx .

For any two subsets U and V of a groupoid G, we define
U s ×r V := (U × V ) ∩ G(2) , U V := {αβ : (α, β) ∈ U s ×r V }, and U −1 := {α−1 : α ∈ U }.
We call a subset B of G a bisection if there exists an open subset U of G containing B
such that r|U and s|U are homeomorphisms onto open subsets of G. We say that G is étale
if r (or, equivalently, s) is a local homeomorphism. If G is étale, then G(0) is open in G,
and both Gx and Gx are discrete in the subspace topology for any x ∈ G(0) . The range
and source maps of an étale groupoid are both open, and hence so is the multiplication
map (see [32, Lemma 8.4.11]1). Moreover, G is étale if and only if G has a basis of open
bisections (see [32, Lemma 8.4.9]). We say that G is ample if it has a basis of compact
open bisections. If G is étale, then G is ample if and only if its unit space G(0) is totally
disconnected (see [15, Proposition 4.1]).
If B and D are compact open bisections of an ample Hausdorff groupoid, then B −1 and
BD are also compact open bisections. In fact, the collection of compact open bisections
forms an inverse semigroup under these operations (see [28, Proposition 2.2.4]).
The isotropy of a groupoid G is the set
[
Iso(G) := {γ ∈ G : r(γ) = s(γ)} =
Gxx .
x∈G(0)

We say that G is principal if Iso(G) = G(0) , and that G is effective if the topological
interior of Iso(G) is equal to G(0) . We say that G is topologically principal if the set
{x ∈ G(0) : Gxx = {x}} is dense in G(0) . Every principal étale groupoid is effective and
topologically principal. If G is a Hausdorff étale groupoid, then G is effective if it is
1Although

the argument given in [32, Lemma 8.4.11] is for second-countable groupoids, it can be adapted
to work without the second-countability hypothesis by replacing sequences with nets.

4

ARMSTRONG, CLARK, COURTNEY, LIN, MCCORMICK, AND RAMAGGE

topologically principal, and the converse holds if G is additionally second-countable (see
[5, Lemma 3.1]). We will often work with Hausdorff groupoids that are étale, ample, or
second-countable, but we will explicitly state these assumptions.
Before we describe algebras of functions defined on a groupoid, a few remarks on preliminary point-set topology and notation are in order. Given topological spaces X and Y , a
function f : X → Y is said to be locally constant if every element of X has an open neighbourhood U such that f |U is constant. Every locally constant function is continuous, and if
Y has the discrete topology, then every continuous function f : X → Y is locally constant.
Throughout, let R be a commutative unital ring endowed with the discrete topology, and
write R× for the subgroup of units in R.
Given a topological space X and a topological ring Z, we define the support of a function
f : X → Z to be the set
supp(f ) := {x ∈ X : f (x) 6= 0} = f −1 (Z\{0}).
If f is continuous, then its support is open, and if f is locally constant, then its support is
clopen. We say that f is compactly supported if supp(f ) is compact.
As motivation for our definition of a twisted Steinberg algebra, it will be helpful to briefly
recall the construction of groupoid C∗ -algebras and Steinberg algebras, and to describe the
ways in which twisted groupoid C∗ -algebras have been defined in the literature.
We begin by describing groupoid C∗ -algebras, which were introduced by Renault in [30].
In the discussion that follows, it will suffice to restrict our attention to the setting in
which the underlying Hausdorff groupoid G is second-countable and étale. Although the
étale assumption is not required, this setting is general enough to include a plethora of
examples, including the Cuntz–Krieger algebras of all compactly aligned topological higherrank graphs (see [36, Theorem 3.16]).
Given a second-countable Hausdorff étale groupoid G, the convolution algebra Cc (G) is
the complex ∗-algebra
Cc (G) := {f : G → C : f is continuous and supp(f ) is compact},
equipped with multiplication given by the convolution product

and involution given by f ∗ (γ) := f (γ −1 ). The full groupoid C ∗ -algebra C ∗ (G) is defined
to be the completion of Cc (G) in the full C ∗ -norm, and the reduced groupoid C ∗ -algebra
Cr∗ (G) is defined to be the completion of Cc (G) in the reduced C ∗ -norm (see [32, Chapter 9]
for the details).
The first conception of a twisted groupoid C∗ -algebra was also introduced by Renault
in [30]. In this setting, the “twist” refers to a continuous T-valued 2-cocycle on G, which
is incorporated into the definitions of the multiplication and involution of the convolution
algebra Cc (G). Given an arbitrary commutative unital topological ring R, a (continuous)
2-cocycle is a continuous function σ : G(2) → R× that satisfies the 2-cocycle identity:
σ(α, β) σ(αβ, γ) = σ(α, βγ) σ(β, γ),
for all (α, β, γ) ∈ G(3) , and is normalised , in the sense that
σ(r(γ), γ) = 1 = σ(γ, s(γ)),
for all γ ∈ G. We say that the 2-cocycles σ, τ : G(2) → R× are cohomologous if there is a
continuous function b : G → R× satisfying b(x) = 1 for all x ∈ G(0) , and
σ(α, β) τ (α, β)−1 = b(α) b(β) b(αβ)−1

TWISTED STEINBERG ALGEBRAS

for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) . We may also define 2-cocycles taking values in a particular subgroup
T of R× , and in this case two 2-cocycles are cohomologous if there is a function b taking
values in T and satisfying the condition above. Cohomology of continuous 2-cocycles on
G is an equivalence relation. The equivalence class of a continuous 2-cocycle σ under this
relation is called its cohomology class. Note that if we omit the requirement that a 2-cocycle
be normalised, it turns out that every 2-cocycle that is not normalised is cohomologous to
one that is normalised (see, for example, [6, Footnote 1, Page 1262]). Thus, since we show
in Lemma 3.5 that cohomologous 2-cocycles give isomorphic twisted Steinberg algebras, it
makes sense for us to just assume that all 2-cocycles are normalised.
Given a 2-cocycle σ : G(2) → T, the twisted convolution algebra Cc (G, σ) is the complex
∗-algebra that is equal as a vector space to Cc (G), but has multiplication given by the
twisted convolution product

(α,β)∈G(2) ,
αβ=γ

η∈Gs(γ)

and involution given by
f ∗ (γ) := σ(γ, γ −1 ) f (γ −1 ).
The 2-cocycle identity guarantees that the multiplication is associative, and the assumption
that the 2-cocycle is normalised implies that the twist is trivial when either multiplying
or applying the involution to functions supported on G(0) . The full twisted groupoid C ∗ algebra C ∗ (G, σ) is defined to be the completion of Cc (G, σ) in the full C ∗ -norm, and the
reduced twisted groupoid C ∗ -algebra Cr∗ (G, σ) is defined to be the completion of Cc (G, σ) in
the reduced C ∗ -norm (see [30, Chapter II.1] for the details). There is also a ∗-algebra norm
on Cc (G, σ), called the I-norm, which is given by

for all f ∈ Cc (G, σ). The I-norm dominates the full norm on Cc (G, σ).
Renault [30] also introduced an alternative construction of these twisted groupoid C∗ algebras involving twisting the groupoid itself, via a split groupoid extension
G(0) × T ,→ G ×σ T  G,
called a twist over G. In 1986, Kumjian generalised this construction to give twisted
groupoid C∗ -algebras whose twists are not induced by T-valued 2-cocycles. In particular,
the extension Σ of G by G(0) × T need not admit a continuous global section P : G → Σ.
In Section 4.1 we develop a “discretised” version of this more general notion of a twist,
whose definition is in line with [7] when G is a discrete group. Since our definition is almost
identical to Kumjian’s (with the difference being the choice of topology on T ≤ C× ), we
refer the reader to Definition 4.1 for a more precise definition of a twist over a Hausdorff
étale groupoid. Given a twist
G(0) × T ,→ Σ  G,
over a Hausdorff étale groupoid G, one constructs a ∗-algebra by defining an (untwisted)
convolution and involution on the subspace of Cc (Σ) consisting of T-equivariant functions.
Completing this ∗-algebra with respect to the full (or reduced) C∗ -norm yields the full (or
reduced) twisted groupoid C∗ -algebra C ∗ (G, Σ) (or Cr∗ (G, Σ)). (See [31] or [32, Chapter 11]
for more details.)
We conclude this section with the definition of Steinberg algebras, which were originally
introduced in [34, 10], and are a purely algebraic analogue of groupoid C∗ -algebras. Let G

6

be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let 1B denote the characteristic function of B from
G to R. The Steinberg algebra associated to G is
AR (G) := span{1B : G → R : B is a compact open bisection of G}
= {f : G → R : f is continuous and supp(f ) is compact},
equipped with multiplication given by the convolution product

The complex Steinberg algebra A(G) := ACd (G) is a ∗-algebra with involution given by
f ∗ (γ) := f (γ −1 ). It is shown in shown in [34, 10] that A(G) is dense in Cc (G) with respect
to both the full and reduced C∗ -norms.
3. Twisted Steinberg algebras arising from locally constant 2-cocycles
In this section we introduce the twisted Steinberg algebra AR (G, σ) over a discrete commutative unital ring R (or A(G, σ) when R = Cd ) associated to an ample Hausdorff groupoid
G and a continuous 2-cocycle σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× . As an R-module, the twisted Steinberg
algebra is identical to the untwisted version defined in Section 2. That is,
AR (G, σ) := span{1B : G → R : B is a compact open bisection of G};
we now emphasise that we are viewing R with the discrete topology.
Lemma 3.1. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let Cc (G, R) denote the collection
of continuous compactly supported functions f : G → R. For any continuous 2-cocycle
σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× , we have the following:
(a) AR (G, σ) = Cc (G, R) = {f ∈ Cc (G) : f is locally constant} as R-modules; and
(b) for any f ∈ AR (G, σ), there exist λ1 , . . . , λn ∈ R\{0}
Pn and mutually disjoint compact
open bisections B1 , . . . , Bn ⊆ G such that f = i=1 λi 1Bi .
Proof. Part (a) follows from the characterisations of the Steinberg algebra AR (G) given
in [34, Definition 4.1 and Remark 4.2], because AR (G, σ) and AR (G) agree as R-modules.
Similarly, part (b) follows from [8, Lemma 2.2].

From now on, we will use the characterisations of AR (G, σ) as an R-module given in
Lemma 3.1(a) interchangeably with the definition.
We equip AR (G, σ) with a multiplication that incorporates the 2-cocycle σ into its definition, thereby distinguishing AR (G, σ) from AR (G). If we additionally assume that there
is an involution r 7→ r on the ring R, and that T is a subgroup of R× such that z = z −1
for each z ∈ T and the 2-cocycle σ is T -valued, then we may also define an involution ∗
on AR (G, σ) that will make AR (G, σ) into a ∗-algebra. We call such an involution on R a
T -inverse involution.
Proposition 3.2. Let R be a commutative unital ring, let G be an ample Hausdorff
groupoid, and let σ : G(2) → R× be a continuous 2-cocycle. There is a multiplication (called
(twisted) convolution) on the R-module AR (G, σ), given by

(f ∗σ g)(γ) :=
σ(α, β) f (α) g(β) =
σ(γη, η −1 ) f (γη) g(η −1 ),

under which AR (G, σ) is an R-algebra. Suppose additionally that R has a T -inverse involution r 7→ r for some T ≤ R× and that σ is T -valued. Then there is an involution on

TWISTED STEINBERG ALGEBRAS

AR (G, σ), given by
f ∗ (γ) := σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 f (γ −1 ),
under which AR (G, σ) is a ∗-algebra over R. We call AR (G, σ) the twisted Steinberg algebra
over R associated to the pair (G, σ).
The complex twisted Steinberg algebra A(G, σ) := ACd (G, σ) is a dense ∗-subalgebra of
the complex twisted convolution algebra Cc (G, σ) with respect to the I-norm and the full and
reduced C ∗ -norms.
Remarks 3.3.

(1) If the 2-cocycle σ is trivial (in the sense that σ G(2) = {1}), then AR (G, σ) is
identical to AR (G) as an R-algebra.
(2) We often write f ∗ g or f g to denote the convolution product f ∗σ g of functions
f, g ∈ AR (G, σ) if the intended meaning is clear.
(3) If f, g ∈ AR (G, σ), then supp(f g) ⊆ supp(f ) supp(g). If B and D are compact open
bisections of G such that supp(f ) = B and supp(g) = D, then supp(f g) = BD,
and when AR (G, σ) is a ∗-algebra, supp(f ∗ ) = B −1 .
(4) From the 2-cocycle identity, one can readily verify that σ(γ, γ −1 ) = σ(γ −1 , γ) for
any γ ∈ G.
Proof of Proposition 3.2. As R-modules, AR (G, σ) ∼
= AR (G). We first show that AR (G, σ)
is closed under the twisted convolution. Fix f, g ∈ AR (G, σ). By Lemma 3.1(b), there
exist mutually disjoint compact open bisections B1 , . . . , Bm , C1 , . . . , Cn ⊆ G and scalars
λ1 , . . . , λm , µ1 , . . . , µn ∈ R\{0} such that

We claim that f g ∈ AR (G, σ). Since G is étale and f and g have compact support, for each
γ ∈ G, the set

(α, β) ∈ G(2) : αβ = γ and σ(α, β) f (α) g(β) 6= 0
is finite (see [32, Proposition 9.1.1]). Since σ is locally constant, we can assume that for
all i ∈ {1, . . . , m} and j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, there exists νi,j ∈ R× such that σ(α, β) = νi,j for all
(α, β) ∈ (Bi )s ×r (Cj ) (because otherwise we can further refine the bisections to ensure that
this is true). Thus, for all γ ∈ G, we have

Hence f ∗σ g ∈ AR (G, σ). The remainder of the verification that AR (G, σ) is an R-algebra
is similar to [30, Proposition II.1.1].
Suppose now that R has a T -inverse involution r 7→ r for some T ≤ R× . We show that
∗
f ∈ AR (G, σ). Since σ is locally constant, we can assume that for all i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, there

exists κi ∈ T such that σ(γ, γ −1 ) = κi for all γ ∈ Bi (because otherwise we can further
refine the bisections to ensure that this is true). Thus, for all γ ∈ G, we have

Hence f ∈ AR (G, σ).
Clearly the proposed involution distributes across sums, and (λf )∗ = λf ∗ for all λ ∈ R.
Fix γ ∈ G. Since the involution on R restricts to inversion on T , we see that
(f ∗ )∗ (γ) = σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 f ∗ (γ −1 ) = σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 σ(γ −1 , γ)−1 f (γ) = f (γ).
Furthermore, we have
(f ∗σ g)∗ (γ) = σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 (f ∗σ g)(γ −1 )

Using several applications of the 2-cocycle identity and that σ is normalised, we see that

= σ(α, α−1 ) σ(β, β −1 ) σ(ββ −1 , α−1 ) σ(β −1 , α−1 )−1
= σ(α−1 , α) σ(β −1 , β) σ(β −1 , α−1 )−1 .

(3.3)

Thus, we deduce from equations (3.1), (3.2), and (3.3) that (f ∗σ g)∗ = g ∗ ∗σ f ∗ , and so
AR (G, σ) is a ∗-algebra over R.
Finally, since ACd (G, σ) and ACd (G) agree as vector spaces, it follows from [28, Proposition 2.2.7] that ACd (G, σ) is dense in Cc (G, σ) with respect to the I-norm, and hence
also with respect to the full and reduced C∗ -norms, since they are both dominated by the
I-norm.

Note that we used that σ is locally constant in order to show that AR (G, σ) is closed
under the twisted convolution and involution.
In the untwisted Steinberg algebra setting, given compact open bisections B and D of G,
we have 1B 1D = 1BD . This is not the case in the twisted setting, due to the presence of the
2-cocycle in the convolution formula. Instead, we have the following properties concerning
the generators 1B of the twisted Steinberg algebra AR (G, σ).
Lemma 3.4. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let σ : G(2) → R× be a continuous
2-cocycle. Suppose that B and D are compact open bisections of G.
(a) For all (α, β) ∈ B s ×r D, we have
(1B 1D )(αβ) = σ(α, β) 1B (α) 1D (β) = σ(α, β) 1BD (αβ) = σ(α, β).
(b) If B ⊆ G(0) or D ⊆ G(0) , then 1B 1D = 1BD .

Suppose that R has a T -inverse involution r 7→ r for some T ≤ R× and that σ is T -valued.
(c) For all γ ∈ G, we have 1∗B (γ) = σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 1B −1 (γ).
(d) We have 1B 1∗B = 1r(B) and 1∗B 1B = 1s(B) .
(e) We have 1B 1∗B 1B = 1B and 1∗B 1B 1∗B = 1∗B .
Proof.

(a) This follows immediately from the definition of the twisted convolution product because B and D are bisections.
(b) Suppose that B ⊆ G(0) or D ⊆ G(0) , and fix γ ∈ G. If γ ∈ BD, then γ = αβ for
some pair (α, β) ∈ B s ×r D. Since σ is normalised, we have σ(α, β) = 1, and so
(1B 1D )(γ) = σ(α, β) 1B (α) 1D (β) = 1B (α) 1D (β) = 1BD (γ).
If γ ∈
/ BD, then (1B 1D )(γ) = 0 = 1BD (γ). Thus 1B 1D = 1BD .
(c) If γ ∈ B −1 , then we have
1∗B (γ) = σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 1B (γ −1 ) = σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 1B −1 (γ).
If γ ∈
/ B −1 = supp(1∗B ), then
1∗B (γ) = 0 = 1B −1 (γ) = σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 1B −1 (γ).

(d) We know that supp(1B 1∗B ) = BB −1 = r(B), and for all γ ∈ B, we have
(1B 1∗B )(r(γ)) = (1B 1∗B )(γγ −1 )
= σ(γ, γ −1 ) 1B (γ) 1∗B (γ −1 )
= σ(γ, γ −1 ) 1B (γ) σ(γ −1 , γ)−1 1B −1 (γ −1 )
=1

(using part (c))

= 1r(B) (r(γ)).
Similarly, we have supp(1∗B 1B ) = B −1 B = s(B), and so for all γ ∈ B, we have
(1∗B 1B )(s(γ)) = (1∗B 1B )(γ −1 γ)
= σ(γ −1 , γ) 1∗B (γ −1 ) 1B (γ)
= σ(γ −1 , γ) σ(γ −1 , γ)−1 1B −1 (γ −1 ) 1B (γ)
=1

(using part (c))

= 1s(B) (s(γ)).
(e) Parts (b) and (d) imply that
1B 1∗B 1B = 1r(B) 1B = 1r(B)B = 1B ,

and

1∗B 1B 1∗B = 1s(B) 1∗B .

Hence supp(1∗B 1B 1∗B ) = s(B)B −1 = B −1 . For all γ ∈ B, we have
(1∗B 1B 1∗B )(γ −1 ) = σ(s(γ), γ −1 ) 1s(B) (s(γ)) 1∗B (γ −1 ) = 1∗B (γ −1 ),
and so 1∗B 1B 1∗B = 1∗B .

The proof of the following result is inspired by the proof of [30, Proposition II.1.2].
Lemma 3.5. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let σ, τ : G(2) → T ≤ R× be two
continuous 2-cocycles whose cohomology classes coincide. Then AR (G, σ) is isomorphic to
AR (G, τ ). If R has a T -inverse involution, then AR (G, σ) is ∗-isomorphic to AR (G, τ ).
Proof. For this proof, we will use ∗ to denote convolution, in order to distinguish it from
the pointwise product.
Since σ is cohomologous to τ , there is a continuous function b : G → T satisfying b(x) = 1
for all x ∈ G(0) , and
σ(α, β) τ (α, β)−1 = b(α) b(β) b(αβ)−1 ,
(3.4)
(2)
for all (α, β) ∈ G .

For each f ∈ AR (G, σ) = Cc (G, R), let θ(f ) denote the pointwise product bf . Since
bf : G → R is continuous and satisfies supp(bf ) = supp(f ), we have bf ∈ Cc (G, R) =
AR (G, τ ). We claim that θ : AR (G, σ) → AR (G, τ ) is an R-algebra isomorphism. It is clear
that θ is R-linear. We must show that θ respects the twisted convolution operation, and
that it respects the involution in the case where R has a T -inverse involution.
For all (α, β) ∈ G(2) , equation (3.4) implies that
σ(α, β) b(αβ) = τ (α, β) b(α) b(β).

(3.5)

Hence, for all f, g ∈ AR (G, σ) and γ ∈ G, we have
X

= θ(f ∗σ g)(γ).
Therefore, θ is an R-algebra homomorphism.
We now show that θ is a bijection. Define b−1 : G → T by b−1 (γ) := b(γ)−1 . For
each h ∈ AR (G, τ ), we have b−1 h ∈ AR (G, σ), and so θ(b−1 h) = bb−1 h = h. Hence θ is
surjective. To see that θ is injective, suppose that f, g ∈ AR (G, σ) satisfy θ(f ) = θ(g). Then
f = b−1 bf = b−1 θ(f ) = b−1 θ(g) = b−1 bg = g. Therefore, θ is an R-algebra isomorphism.
Now suppose that R has a T -inverse involution r 7→ r. For all γ ∈ G, letting α = γ and
β = γ −1 in equation (3.4) gives
σ(γ, γ −1 ) τ (γ, γ −1 )−1 = b(γ) b(γ −1 ) b(γγ −1 )−1 = b(γ) b(γ −1 ),
and hence
b(γ) σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 = τ (γ, γ −1 )−1 b(γ −1 ).

(3.6)

Thus, for all f ∈ AR (G, σ) and γ ∈ G, we have
θ(f ∗ )(γ) = b(γ) f ∗ (γ)
= b(γ) σ(γ, γ −1 )−1 f (γ −1 )
= τ (γ, γ −1 )−1 b(γ −1 ) f (γ −1 )

(using equation (3.6))

and so θ is a ∗-isomorphism.

Proposition 3.6. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× be a

forms a local unit for AR (G, σ). That is, for any finite collection f1 , . . . , fn ∈ AR (G, σ),
there exists a compact open subset E of G(0) such that
1E fi = fi = fi 1E ,
for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
Proof. Since multiplication by 1E for E ⊆ G(0) is not affected by the 2-cocycle, this follows
from the analogous non-twisted result [9, Lemma 2.6].

4. Twisted Steinberg algebras arising from discrete twists
There is another (often more general) notion of a twisted groupoid C∗ -algebra which is
constructed from a “twist” over the groupoid itself; that is, from a locally split groupoid
extension of a Hausdorff étale groupoid G by G(0) ×T. In this section, we define a discretised
algebraic analogue of this twist and its associated twisted Steinberg algebra. The primary
modification is to replace the topological group T with a discrete subgroup T of R× . Many
of the results in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 have roots or inspiration in Kumjian’s study of groupoid
C∗ -algebras built from groupoid extensions in [18].
The results in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 also hold in the classical setting with the same proofs.
If one is interested in T-valued 2-cocycles, replacing T with T (endowed with the standard
topology) will not change any of the algebraic arguments therein, and the topological arguments carry through mutatis mutandis. As our ultimate focus is algebraic, we present
all of our results in terms of T .
4.1. Discrete twists over Hausdorff étale groupoids. The definition of a twist over
a Hausdorff étale groupoid, which we refer to as a classical twist, can be found in [32,
Definition 11.1.1]. The following is our discretised version.
Definition 4.1. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, let R be a commutative unital ring,
and let T ≤ R× . A discrete twist by T over G is a sequence
i

q

G(0) × T ,→ Σ  G,
where the groupoid G(0) × T is regarded as a trivial
group bundle with fibres T , Σ is

a Hausdorff groupoid with Σ(0) = i G(0) × {1} , and i and q are continuous groupoid
homomorphisms that restrict to homeomorphisms of unit spaces, such that the following
conditions hold.
(a) The sequence is exact, in the sense that i({x} × T ) = q −1 (x) for every x ∈ G(0) , i is
injective, and q is a quotient map.2
(b) The groupoid Σ is a locally trivial G-bundle, in the sense that for each α ∈ G, there
is an open bisection Bα of G containing α, and a continuous map Pα : Bα → Σ such
that
(i) q ◦ Pα = idBα ; and
(ii) the map (β, z) 7→ i(r(β), z) Pα (β) is a homeomorphism from Bα ×T to q −1 (Bα ).
(c) The image of i is central in Σ, in the sense that i(r(ε), z) ε = ε i(s(ε), z) for all ε ∈ Σ
and z ∈ T .
We denote a discrete twist over G either by (Σ, i, q), or simply by Σ. We identify Σ(0) with
G(0) via q|Σ(0) . A continuous map Pα : Bα → Σ is called a (continuous) local section if it
satisfies condition (b)(i). A (classical) twist over G has the same definition as above, with
the exception that T is replaced by T.
2Although

it is not explicitly stated in [32, Definition 11.1.1] that the groupoid homomorphism q : Σ → G
is a quotient map and satisfies q(i(x, z)) = x for every (x, z) ∈ G(0) × T, it follows from the definition.

12

ARMSTRONG, CLARK, COURTNEY, LIN, MCCORMICK, AND RAMAGGE

In brief, we think of a discrete twist by T over G as a locally split extension Σ of G by
G(0) × T , where the image of G(0) × T under i is central in Σ.
Example 4.2. If G is a discrete group, then a discrete twist over G as defined above is a
central extension of G.
The following result contains several additional properties of discrete twists, which are
consequences of Definition 4.1.
Lemma 4.3. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let (Σ, i, q) be a discrete twist by
T ≤ R× over G. Then the following conditions hold.
(a) The groupoid Σ is étale.
(b) The map i is a homeomorphism onto an open subset of Σ.
(c) The open bisections and continuous local sections in Definition 4.1(b) can be chosen
so that Pα (G(0) ∩ Bα ) ⊆ Σ(0) for each α ∈ G.
(d) If G is ample, then the open bisections in Definition 4.1(b) can be chosen to be
compact.
Proof. For part (a), we will show that the range map on Σ is a local homeomorphism.
For this, fix ε ∈ Σ. It suffices to find an open neighbourhood Uε ⊆ Σ of ε such that r|Uε
is a homeomorphism onto an open subset of Σ. By Definition 4.1(b) there exist an open
bisection Bq(ε) of G containing q(ε), and a continuous local section Pq(ε) : Bq(ε) → Σ, such
that the map φq(ε) : Bq(ε) × T → q −1 (Bq(ε) ) given by φq(ε) (β, z) := i(r(β),
z) Pq(ε) (β)

 is a
homeomorphism. For each (β, z) ∈ Bq(ε) × T , we have q φq(ε) (β, z) = q Pq(ε) (β) = β.
Since ε ∈ q −1 (Bq(ε)
 ), there is a unique zε ∈ T such that φq(ε) (q(ε), zε ) = ε. Define Uε :=
φq(ε) Bq(ε) × {zε } . Then ε ∈ Uε , and since T has the discrete topology and φq(ε) is an
open map onto an open subset of Σ,
subset of Σ. Since q(Uε ) = Bq(ε) ,
 Uε is an open
−1
−1
we have r(Uε ) = (q|Σ(0) ) r(q(Uε )) = (q|Σ(0) ) (r(Bq(ε) )). Thus r(Uε ) is open in Σ,
because the range map in G is open and q|Σ(0) is continuous. To see that r|Uε is injective,
suppose that r(ζ) = r(η) for some ζ, η ∈ Uε . Then q(ζ), q(η) ∈ Bq(ε) and r(q(ζ)) =
q(r(ζ)) = q(r(η)) = r(q(η)), and so q(ζ) = q(η) since r|Bq(ε) is injective. Thus, we have
ζ = φq(ε) (q(ζ), zε ) = φq(ε) (q(η), zε ) = η, and so r|Uε is injective. Therefore, Σ is étale.
For part (b), note that the image of i is q −1 (G(0) ), which is open in Σ because q is
continuous and G(0) is an open subset of G. Since i is injective and continuous by definition,
we need only show that i is an open map. Fix z ∈ T and an open set U ⊆ G(0) . Then U is
open in G because G(0) is open in G. Since T has the discrete topology, it suffices to show
that i(U × {z}) is open in Σ. Fix x ∈ U . By Definition 4.1(b) there exist an open bisection
Bx of G containing x, and a continuous local section Px : Bx → Σ, such that the map
φx : Bx × T → q −1 (Bx ) given by φx (γ, w) := i(r(γ), w) Px (γ) is a homeomorphism. Since
φx |(Bx ∩U )×T is a homeomorphism onto q −1 (Bx ∩U ), we may assume that Bx ⊆ U ⊆ G(0) . For
each y ∈ Bx , we have φx (y, 1) = i(y, 1) Px (y) = Px (y), and so Px (Bx ) = φx (Bx ×{1}). Since
T has the discrete topology and φx is an open map onto an open subset of Σ, we deduce that
Px (Bx ) is an open subset of Σ. For each y ∈ Bx ⊆ G(0) , we have φx (y, z) = i(y, z) Px (y),
and hence
i(Bx × {z}) = φx (Bx × {z}) Px (Bx )−1 .
Since φx and inversion in Σ are homeomorphisms and part (a) implies that multiplication
in Σ is an open map, we deduce that i(Bx × {z}) is an open subset of Σ. Therefore,
[
i(U × {z}) =
i(Bx × {z})
x∈U

is an open subset of Σ, and hence i is a homeomorphism.

For part (c), fix α ∈ G. By Definition 4.1(b) there exist an open bisection Dα of G
containing α, and a continuous local section Sα : Dα → Σ, such that the map φSα : (β, z) 7→
i(r(β), z) Sα (β) is a homeomorphism from Dα × T to q −1 (Dα ).
There are two cases to consider. First, suppose that α ∈ G\G(0) . Define Bα := Dα \G(0)
and Pα := Sα |Bα . Since G is Hausdorff, G(0) is closed, and hence Bα is open. It follows
from the definitions of Dα and Sα that Bα is a bisection of G containing α, and that Pα
is a continuous map satisfying q ◦ Pα = idBα . Since G(0) ∩ Bα = ∅, we trivially have
Pα (G(0) ∩ Bα ) ⊆ Σ(0) . Alternatively, suppose that α ∈ G(0) . Define Bα := G(0) ∩ Dα and
Pα := (q|Σ(0) )−1 |Bα . Since G is étale, G(0) is open, and hence Bα is open. It follows from the
definition of Dα that Bα is a bisection of G containing α. Since Bα ⊆ G(0) and q restricts
to a homeomorphism of unit spaces, Pα is a continuous map satisfying q ◦ Pα = idBα and
Pα (G(0) ∩ Bα ) = (q|Σ(0) )−1 (Bα ) ⊆ Σ(0) .
We now show that condition (b)(ii) is still satisfied in both cases. Define φPα (β, z) :=
i(r(β), z) Pα (β) for all (β, z) ∈ Bα ×T . To see that φPα is injective, suppose that φPα (β, z) =
φPα (γ, w) for some (β, z), (γ, w) ∈ Bα × T . Since i(G(0) × T ) = q −1 (G(0) ) and q ◦ Pα = idBα ,
we have β = q φPα (β, z) = q φPα (γ, w) = γ, and hence
i(r(β), z) = φPα (β, z) Pα (β)−1 = φPα (γ, w) Pα (β)−1 = i(r(γ), w) = i(r(β), w).
It follows from the injectivity of i that z = w, and hence φPα is injective.
To see that φPα

is surjective, fix ε ∈ q −1 (Bα ), and let β := q(ε). Then q ε Pα (β)−1 = q(ε)β −1 = r(β), and
so ε Pα (β)−1 ∈ q −1 (r(β)). Hence Definition 4.1(a) implies that there exists z ∈ T such that
ε Pα (β)−1 = i(r(β), z). Thus φPα (β, z) = i(r(β), z) Pα (β) = ε, and so φPα is surjective.
If α ∈ G\G(0) , then φPα = φSα |Bα ×T , and it follows that φPα is open and continuous.
If α ∈ G(0) , then Bα ⊆ G(0) , and φPα (y, z) = i(y, z) (q|Σ(0) )−1 (y) for all (y, z) ∈ Bα × T .
Part (a) implies that multiplication in Σ is open, and it follows from the fact that the maps
i and (q|Σ(0) )−1 and multiplication in Σ are all open and continuous that φPα is also open
and continuous. Therefore, in either case, φPα : Bα × T → q −1 (Bα ) is a homeomorphism.
Part (d) is immediate, because every ample groupoid has a basis of compact open bisections.

We define a notion of an isomorphism of discrete twists in an analogous way to the
classical version.
Definition 4.4. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid. We say that two discrete twists
(Σ, i, q) and (Σ0 , i0 , q 0 ) by T ≤ R× over G are isomorphic if there exists a groupoid isomorphism3 ψ : Σ → Σ0 such that the following diagram commutes.

It is natural to ask whether there is a correspondence between discrete twists over a
groupoid and locally constant 2-cocycles which can be used to “twist” the multiplication in
Steinberg algebras, given the shared terminology. As one familiar with the literature would
expect, we can readily build a twist over a Hausdorff étale groupoid from a locally constant
2-cocycle. To demonstrate this, we adapt the construction outlined in [32, Example 11.1.5]
to the setting where the continuous 2-cocycle maps into a discrete group T ≤ R× (rather
than T).
3We

say that ψ : Σ → Σ0 is a groupoid isomorphism if it is a homeomorphism such that ψ(δε) = ψ(δ)ψ(ε)
for all (δ, ε) ∈ Σ(2) .

14

ARMSTRONG, CLARK, COURTNEY, LIN, MCCORMICK, AND RAMAGGE

Example 4.5. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× be a
continuous 2-cocycle. Let G ×σ T be the set G × T endowed with the product topology,
with multiplication given by
(α, z)(β, w) := (αβ, σ(α, β) zw),
and inversion given by
(α, z)−1 := (α−1 , σ(α, α−1 )−1 z −1 ) = (α−1 , σ(α−1 , α)−1 z −1 ),
for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) and z, w ∈ T . Then G ×σ T is a Hausdorff groupoid. In fact, unlike in
the classical setting, G being étale implies that G ×σ T is étale, because for each z ∈ T and
bisection U of G, r|U ×{z} is a homeomorphism onto r(U )×{1}. Define i : G(0) ×T → G×σ T
by i(x, z) := (x, z), and q : G ×σ T → G by q(γ, z) := γ. Then q is easily verified to be a
quotient map, and since σ is normalised, i is an injective groupoid homomorphism. Just as
in [32, Example 11.1.5], it is routine to then check that (G ×σ T, i, q) is a discrete twist by
T over G.
Example 4.5 shows that any locally constant 2-cocycle on a Hausdorff étale groupoid G
gives rise to a discrete twist over G; the converse is true when G is additionally secondcountable and ample. The proof of this fact and its consequences will be the focus of the
remainder of this subsection.
Before we proceed, we need two technical results regarding the left and right group actions
of T on Σ that are induced by the map i : G(0) × T → Σ. Identifying Σ(0) with G(0) , these
actions are given by
z · ε := i(r(ε), z) ε

and

ε · z := ε i(s(ε), z),

for each z ∈ T and ε ∈ Σ. Since the image of i is central in Σ, we have z · ε = ε · z, and
(z · ε)(w · δ) = (zw) · (εδ) for all (ε, δ) ∈ Σ(2) and z, w ∈ T .
Lemma 4.6. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid. Suppose that (Σ1 , i1 , q1 ) and (Σ2 , i2 , q2 )
are discrete twists by T ≤ R× over G, and that ψ : Σ1 → Σ2 is an isomorphism of twists, as
defined in Definition 4.4. Then ψ respects the action of T , in the sense that ψ(z·ε) = z·ψ(ε)
for all z ∈ T and ε ∈ Σ1 .
Proof. Since ψ : Σ1 → Σ2 is an isomorphism of twists,
 we have i2 = ψ ◦ i1 . Thus, for all
z ∈ T and ε ∈ Σ1 , we have ψ(z · ε) = ψ i1 (r(ε), z) ε = i2 (r(ε), z) ψ(ε) = z · ψ(ε).

The following result is inspired by [32, Lemma 11.1.3].
Lemma 4.7. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let (Σ, i, q) be a discrete twist by
T ≤ R× over G. Suppose that δ, ε ∈ Σ satisfy q(δ) = q(ε). Then r(δ) = r(ε), and there is
a unique z ∈ T such that ε = z · δ.
Proof. Fix δ, ε ∈ Σ such that q(δ) = q(ε). Then q(r(δ)) = r(q(δ)) = r(q(ε)) = q(r(ε)),
and hence r(δ) = r(ε), because q restricts to a homeomorphism of unit spaces. Thus
(0)
q(εδ −1 ) = q(ε)q(ε)−1
and hence there is a unique element z ∈ T such that
 = r(q(ε)) ∈ G ,(0)
−1
εδ = i r(q(ε)), z . By identifying Σ with G(0) , we obtain ε = i(r(ε), z) δ = z · δ.

Notice that in the case where Σ is the twist G ×σ T described in Example 4.5, we can
check Lemma 4.7 directly. Identifying Σ(0) = G(0) × {1} with G(0) , we have
z · (α, w) = i(r(α), z)(α, w) = (r(α), z)(α, w) = (α, zw),
for all z ∈ T and (α, w) ∈ Σ. If q(δ) = q(ε) for some δ, ε ∈ Σ, then δ = (α, w1 ) and
ε = (α, w2 ) for some α ∈ G and unique w1 , w2 ∈ T . Since T is a group, there is a unique
z ∈ T such that zw1 = w2 , and hence z · δ = (α, zw1 ) = ε.
Our key tool in what follows will be a (continuous) global section; that is, a continuous
map P : G → Σ satisfying q ◦ P = idG and P (G(0) ) ⊆ Σ(0) = i(G(0) × {1}). Our next

result shows that every discrete twist admitting a continuous global section is isomorphic
to a discrete twist coming from a locally constant 2-cocycle, as described in Example 4.5.
Parts of this result are inspired by the analogous classical versions in [18, Section 4] and
[32, Chapter 11].
Proposition 4.8. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let (Σ, i, q) be a discrete twist
by T ≤ R× over G. Suppose that Σ is topologically trivial, in the sense that it admits a
continuous global section P : G → Σ. Then the following conditions hold.
(a) The continuous global section P preserves composability, and induces a continuous
2-cocycle σ : G(2) → T satisfying

P (α)P (β)P (αβ)−1 = i r(α), σ(α, β) ,
for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) .
(b) For all (α, β) ∈ G(2) , we have
P (α)P (β) = σ(α, β) · P (αβ)

and

P (α)−1 = σ(α, α−1 )−1 · P (α−1 ).

(c) Let (G×σ T, iσ , qσ ) be the discrete twist from Example 4.5. The map φP : G×σ T → Σ
defined by φP (α, z) := z · P (α) gives an isomorphism of the twists G ×σ T and Σ.
Proof. For (a), fix (α, β) ∈ G(2) . Since q ◦ P = idG and q is a groupoid homomorphism that
restricts to a homeomorphism of unit spaces, we have
q(s(P (α))) = s(q(P (α))) = s(α) = r(β) = r(q(P (β))) = q(r(P (β))),
and hence (P (α), P (β)) ∈ Σ(2) . We have


q P (α)P (β)P (αβ)−1 = q(P (α)) q(P (β)) q(P (αβ))−1 = αβ(αβ)−1 = r(α) = q P (r(α)) ,
and so Lemma 4.7 implies that there is a unique element σ(α, β) ∈ T such that

P (α)P (β)P (αβ)−1 = σ(α, β) · P (r(α)) = i r(α), σ(α, β) .
(4.1)

Therefore, σ(α, β) = (π2 ◦ i−1 ) P (α)P (β)P (αβ)−1 , where π2 is the projection of G(0) × T
onto the second coordinate. Since i is a homeomorphism onto its image by Lemma 4.3(b),
we deduce that σ is continuous because it is a composition of continuous functions.
To check that σ satisfies the 2-cocycle identity, we fix (α, β, γ) ∈ G(3) and show that
σ(β, γ) = σ(α, β) σ(αβ, γ) σ(α, βγ)−1 .
Since the image of i is central in Σ, we have



i r(α), σ(β, γ) P (α) = P (α) i s(α), σ(β, γ) = P (α) i r(β), σ(β, γ) .

(4.2)

Using equation (4.2) for the first equality below and equation (4.1) for the second and
fourth equalities, we obtain


i r(α), σ(β, γ) = P (α) i r(β), σ(β, γ) P (α)−1
= P (α)P (β)P (γ)P (βγ)−1 P (α)−1



= P (α)P (β)P (αβ)−1 P (αβ)P (γ)P (αβγ)−1 P (αβγ)P (βγ)−1 P (α)−1

−1
= i r(α), σ(α, β) i r(αβ), σ(αβ, γ) i r(α), σ(α, βγ)

= i r(α), σ(α, β) σ(αβ, γ) σ(α, βγ)−1 .
Thus, by the injectivity of i, we deduce that σ satisfies the 2-cocycle identity.
To see that σ is normalised, first note that for all α in G,



q i r(α), σ(r(α), α) = q i r(α), σ(α, s(α)) = q i(r(α), 1) = r(α),
and i(r(α), 1) ∈ Σ(0) . Moreover, by equation (4.1), we have

i r(α), σ(r(α), α) = P (r(α))P (α)P (r(α)α)−1 = P (r(α)) ∈ Σ(0) ,

(4.3)

16

and, since P (s(α)) ∈ Σ(0) ,

i r(α), σ(α, s(α)) = P (α)P (s(α))P (αs(α))−1 = P (α)P (α)−1 = r(P (α)) ∈ Σ(0) .
Since q restricts to a homeomorphism of unit spaces and i is injective, we deduce from
equation (4.3) that for all α ∈ G,
σ(r(α), α) = σ(α, s(α)) = 1.
(2)

For (b), fix (α, β) ∈ G . Then equation (4.1) implies that

P (α)P (β) = i r(αβ), σ(α, β) P (αβ) = σ(α, β) · P (αβ),
and also that

P (α)P (α−1 )P (αα−1 )−1 = i r(α), σ(α, α−1 ) .
Since P (αα−1 )−1 = P (r(α)) ∈ Σ(0) , we deduce that
−1
P (α)−1 = P (α−1 ) i r(α), σ(α, α−1 )
= P (α−1 ) · σ(α, α−1 )−1 = σ(α, α−1 )−1 · P (α−1 ).
For (c), define φP : G ×σ T → Σ by φP (α, z) := z · P (α) = i(r(α), z) P (α). Then φP
is continuous, because it is the pointwise product of the continuous maps i ◦ (r × id) and
P ◦ π1 from G ×σ T to Σ, where π1 is the projection of G ×σ T onto the first coordinate.
To see that φP is injective, suppose that (α, z), (β, w) ∈ G(2) satisfy φP (α, z) = φP (β, w).
Then
α = q(i(r(α), z)) q(P (α)) = q(φP (α, z)) = q(φP (β, w)) = q(i(r(β), w)) q(P (β)) = β.
Therefore,
i(r(α), z) = φP (α, z) P (α)−1 = φP (β, w) P (β)−1 = i(r(β), w) = i(r(α), w),
and since i is injective, we have z= w. Thus φP is injective. To see that φP is surjective,
fix ε ∈ Σ. Since q(ε) = q P (q(ε)) , Lemma 4.7 implies that there exists a unique element
zε ∈ T such that

φP P (q(ε)), zε = zε · P (q(ε)) = i(r(ε), zε ) P (q(ε)) = ε.

Thus φP is surjective, and we have zε = π2 i−1 ε P (q(ε))−1 , where π2 is the projection
of G(0) × T onto the second coordinate. Since φ−1
P (ε) = P (q(ε)), zε and Lemma 4.3(b)
−1
implies that i is continuous on the image of i, we deduce that φ−1
P is continuous, because
it is a composition of continuous maps. Hence φP is a homeomorphism.
To see that φP is also a groupoid homomorphism, fix (α, β) ∈ G(2) and z, w ∈ T . Then,
using part (b) for the third equality, we have
φP (α, z) φP (β, w) = (z · P (α))(w · P (β))
= (zw) · (P (α)P (β))

= (zw) · σ(α, β) · P (αβ)

= σ(α, β)zw · P (αβ)

= φP αβ, σ(α, β)zw

= φP (α, z)(β, w) .
Hence φP is a groupoid isomorphism.
We conclude by showing that φP ◦ iσ = i and q ◦ φP = qσ . Recall from Example 4.5 that
iσ : G(0) × T → G ×σ T is the inclusion map and qσ : G ×σ T → G is the projection onto
the first coordinate. Fix α ∈ G and w ∈ T . Since P (r(α)) ∈ Σ(0) , we have
(φP ◦ iσ )(r(α), w) = φP (r(α), w) = i(r(α), w) P (r(α)) = i(r(α), w),
and

(q ◦ φP )(α, w) = q i(r(α), w) P (α) = r(α)α = α = qσ (α, w).

Therefore, Σ and G ×σ T are isomorphic as twists over G.



As one might expect, all discrete twists constructed from locally constant 2-cocycles (as
in Example 4.5) are topologically trivial, as we now prove.
Lemma 4.9. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× be a continuous 2-cocycle. The twist (G ×σ T, i, q) described in Example 4.5 is topologically trivial,
and the map S : γ 7→ (γ, 1) is a continuous global section from G to G ×σ T that induces σ.
Proof. It is clear that S : G → G ×σ T is a continuous global section, and so G ×σ T is
topologically trivial. By Proposition 4.8(a), S induces a continuous 2-cocycle ω : G(2) → T
satisfying S(α)S(β)S(αβ)−1 = i r(α), ω(α, β) = (r(α), ω(α, β)), for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) . To
see that S induces σ, fix (α, β) ∈ G(2) . Then
(r(α), ω(α, β)) = S(α)S(β)S(αβ)−1
= (α, 1)(β, 1)(αβ, 1)−1
= (αβ, σ(α, β)) (αβ)−1 , σ(αβ, (αβ)−1 )−1

Therefore, σ = ω, and so S induces σ.

Together, Proposition 4.8 and Lemma 4.9 give us a one-to-one correspondence between
discrete twists over a Hausdorff étale groupoid G that admit a continuous global section
and discrete twists over G arising from locally constant 2-cocycles on G.
As we shall see in Theorem 4.10, it turns out that all discrete twists over a secondcountable ample Hausdorff groupoid G admit a continuous global section. We are grateful
to Elizabeth Gillaspy for alerting us to this folklore fact for T = Td , citing conversations
with Alex Kumjian. Because we know of no proofs in the literature, we give a detailed
proof here in the discrete setting.
Theorem 4.10. Let G be a second-countable ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let (Σ, i, q) be
a discrete twist by T ≤ R× over G. Then Σ is topologically trivial.
In order to prove Theorem 4.10, we need the following lemma.
Lemma 4.11. Let G be a second-countable ample Hausdorff groupoid, and suppose that U
is an open cover of G. Then U has a countable refinement {Bj }∞
j=1 of mutually disjoint
compact open bisections that form a cover of G.
Proof. Let U be an open cover of G. By possibly passing to a refinement, we may assume
that U consists of compact open bisections. Since G is second-countable, it is Lindelöf, and
so we may assume that U = {Dj }∞
j=1 , where each Dj is a compact open bisection of G.
n−1

Bi . Then each Bj is a compact
Define B1
D1 , and for each n ≥ 2, define Bn := Dn \ ∪i=1
open bisection contained in Dj , and {Bj }∞
forms
a
disjoint
cover of G.

i=j
Proof of Theorem 4.10. Recall from Definition 4.1(b) that for each α ∈ G, there exists an
open bisection Dα ⊆ G containing α, and a continuous local section Pα : Dα → Σ such
that the map φα : Dα × T → q −1 (Dα ) given by φα (β, z) := i(r(β), z) Pα (β) = z · Pα (β)
is a homeomorphism. Since G is ample, we may assume that each Dα is compact, by
Lemma 4.3(d). By Lemma 4.3(c), we may assume that Pα (G(0) ∩ Dα ) ⊆ Σ(0) for each
α ∈ G. By Lemma 4.11, {Dα }α∈G has a countable refinement {Bj }∞
j=1 consisting of mutually
disjoint compact open bisections that form a cover of G. For each j ≥ 1, choose αj ∈ G
such that Bj ⊆ Dαj , and define Pj := Pαj |Bj . For each β ∈ G, there is a unique jβ ≥ 1
such that β ∈ Bjβ , and hence the map P : G → Σ given by P (β) := Pjβ (β) is well-defined.

Since q(P (β)) = q(Pjβ (β)) = β = idG (β) for all β ∈ G, and Pj (G(0) ∩ Bj ) ⊆ Σ(0) for each
j ≥ 1, P is a global section. To see that P is continuous,
let U be an open subset of Σ.

Then P (U ) = ∪j=1 Pj (U ) = ∪j=1 Pαj (U ) ∩ Bj . Since each Pαj is continuous and
each Bj is open, P −1 (U ) is open in G. Hence P is a continuous global section, and Σ is
topologically trivial.

4.2. Twists and 2-cocycles. In this section we restrict our attention to discrete twists
arising from locally constant 2-cocycles, and we investigate the relationships between such
twists. In particular, we prove the following theorem.
Theorem 4.12. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let σ, τ : G(2) → T ≤ R× be
continuous 2-cocycles. The following are equivalent:
(1) G ×σ T ∼
= G ×τ T ;
(2) σ is cohomologous to τ ; and
(3) σ is induced by a continuous global section P : G → G ×τ T .
We will split the proof of this theorem into three lemmas. This proof has notable overlap
with [18, Section 4] for the case where R = Cd and T = Td , particularly for the equivalence of (2) and (3). However, the two formulations are sufficiently different to warrant
independent treatment here.
The following lemma expands on an argument given in [32, Remark 11.1.6] showing that
the cohomology class of a continuous 2-cocycle σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× can always be recovered
from the discrete twist G ×σ T .
Lemma 4.13. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let τ : G(2) → T ≤ R× be a
continuous 2-cocycle. Suppose that P : G → G ×τ T is a continuous global section, and that
σ : G(2) → T is the induced continuous 2-cocycle satisfying

i r(α), σ(α, β) = P (α)P (β)P (αβ)−1
for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) , as in Proposition 4.8. Then σ is cohomologous to τ .
Proof. To see that σ is cohomologous to τ , we will find a continuous function b : G → T
satisfying b(x) = 1 for all x ∈ G(0) , and
σ(α, β) = τ (α, β) b(α) b(β) b(αβ)−1
for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) . For each γ ∈ G, let b(γ) be the unique element of T such that
P (γ) = (γ, b(γ)). Since P (G(0) ) ⊆ G(0) × {1}, we have b(x) = 1 for all x ∈ G(0) . Since
b = π2 ◦ P , where π2 is the projection of G ×τ T onto the second coordinate, b is continuous.
For all (α, β) ∈ G(2) , we have

i r(α), σ(α, β) = P (α)P (β)P (αβ)−1
= (α, b(α)) (β, b(β)) (αβ, b(αβ))−1


= αβ, τ (α, β) b(α) b(β) (αβ)−1 , τ (αβ, (αβ)−1 )−1 b(αβ)−1
= αβ(αβ)−1 , τ (αβ, (αβ)−1 ) τ (α, β) b(α) b(β) τ (αβ, (αβ)−1 )−1 b(αβ)−1

= r(α), τ (α, β) b(α) b(β) b(αβ)−1 .



Thus, noting that i : G(0) × T → G ×σ T is the inclusion map, we deduce that
σ(α, β) = τ (α, β) b(α) b(β) b(αβ)−1
for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) , as required.



We now show that cohomologous locally constant 2-cocycles give rise to isomorphic twists.

Lemma 4.14. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let σ, τ : G(2) → T ≤ R× be
continuous 2-cocycles. If σ is cohomologous to τ , then the discrete twists G ×σ T and
G ×τ T are isomorphic.
Proof. Suppose that σ is cohomologous to τ . Then there is a continuous function b : G → T
satisfying b(x) = 1 for all x ∈ G(0) , and
b(αβ) σ(α, β) = τ (α, β) b(α) b(β)

for all (α, β) ∈ G . Define ψ : G ×σ T → G ×τ T by ψ(α, z) := (α, b(α)z). Then ψ is
bijective, with inverse given by ψ −1 (α, z) := (α, b(α)−1 z). Since ψ(α, z) = (r(α), b(α))(α, z),
ψ is continuous, because it is the pointwise product of the continuous map (r × b) ◦ π1 and
the identity map, where π1 is the projection of G ×σ T onto the first coordinate. A similar
argument shows that ψ −1 is continuous, and thus ψ is a homeomorphism.
To see that ψ is a groupoid homomorphism, fix (α, β) ∈ G(2) and z, w ∈ T . Using
equation (4.4) for the third equality, we obtain
ψ((α, z)(β, w)) = ψ(αβ, σ(α, β) zw)
= (αβ, b(αβ) σ(α, β) zw)
= (αβ, τ (α, β) b(α) b(β) zw)
= (α, b(α)z) (β, b(β)w)
= ψ(α, z) ψ(β, w),
as required.
We have now shown that G ×σ T and G ×τ T are isomorphic as groupoids. To see that
they are isomorphic as discrete twists, let iσ : G(0) × T → G ×σ T and iτ : G(0) × T → G ×τ T
be the inclusion maps, and let qσ : G ×σ T → G and qτ : G ×τ T → G be the projections
onto the first coordinate. Since b(x) = 1 for all x ∈ G(0) , we have
ψ(iσ (x, z)) = (x, b(x)z) = (x, z) = iτ (x, z),
and
qτ (ψ(α, z)) = qτ (α, b(α)z) = α = qσ (α),
for all x ∈ G , α ∈ G, and z ∈ T . Therefore, ψ is an isomorphism of the twists G ×σ T
and G ×τ T .


Finally, we show that if σ and τ are locally constant 2-cocycles on G giving rise to
isomorphic discrete twists G ×σ T and G ×τ T , then G ×τ T admits a continuous global
section that induces σ.
Lemma 4.15. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let σ, τ : G(2) → T ≤ R× be
continuous 2-cocycles. If (G ×σ T, iσ , qσ ) and (G ×τ T, iτ , qτ ) are isomorphic as twists, then
σ is induced by a continuous global section P : G → G ×τ T .
Proof. Suppose that ψ : G ×σ T → G ×τ T is an isomorphism of twists. By Lemma 4.9, the
map S : γ 7→ (γ, 1) is a continuous global section from G to G ×σ T that induces σ, in the
sense that

S(α)S(β)S(αβ)−1 = iσ r(α), σ(α, β)
(4.5)
for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) .
Define P := ψ ◦ S : G → G ×τ T . We claim that P is a continuous global section. Since
S is a continuous global section and ψ is a groupoid isomorphism, P is continuous and
P (G(0) ) ⊆ G(0) × {1}. Recall from Example 4.5 that qσ : G ×σ T → G and qτ : G ×τ T → G
are the projections onto the first coordinate. Since ψ is an isomorphism of twists, we have
qτ ◦ P = qτ ◦ (ψ ◦ S) = (qτ ◦ ψ) ◦ S = qσ ◦ S = idG ,

and hence P is a continuous global section.
We now show that P induces σ. By Proposition 4.8(a), P induces a continuous 2-cocycle
ω : G(2) → T satisfying

P (α)P (β)P (αβ)−1 = iτ r(α), ω(α, β)
(4.6)
for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) . Together, equations (4.6) and (4.5) imply that

for all (α, β) ∈ G(2) . Since iσ and iτ are both injective, we deduce that σ = ω, and hence
σ is induced by P .

We now combine these three lemmas to prove our main theorem for this section.
Proof of Theorem 4.12. Lemma 4.15 gives (1) =⇒ (3), Lemma 4.13 gives (3) =⇒ (2), and
Lemma 4.14 gives (2) =⇒ (1).

We conclude this section with a corollary of Theorem 4.12.
Corollary 4.16. Let G be a Hausdorff étale groupoid, and let Σ be a topologically trivial
discrete twist by T ≤ R× over G. Suppose that σ, τ : G(2) → T are continuous 2-cocycles
that are induced by continuous global sections Pσ , Pτ : G → Σ, as in Proposition 4.8(a).
Then σ is cohomologous to τ .
Proof. By Proposition 4.8(c), we have G ×σ T ∼
= Σ∼
= G ×τ T , and hence Theorem 4.12
implies that σ is cohomologous to τ .

4.3. Twisted Steinberg algebras arising from discrete twists. In this section we give
a construction of a twisted Steinberg algebra AR (G; Σ) coming from a topologically trivial
discrete twist Σ over an ample Hausdorff groupoid G. We prove that if two such twists are
isomorphic, then they give rise to isomorphic twisted Steinberg algebras. We also prove
that if Σ ∼
= G ×σ T for some continuous 2-cocycle σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× , then the twisted
Steinberg algebras AR (G; Σ) and AR (G, σ −1 ) are R-algebraically isomorphic, where σ −1 is
the continuous T -valued 2-cocycle (α, β) 7→ σ(α, β)−1 .
Definition 4.17. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let (Σ, i, q) be a topologically
trivial discrete twist by T ≤ R× over G. We say that f ∈ C(Σ, R) is T -equivariant if
f (z · ε) = z f (ε) for all z ∈ T and ε ∈ Σ, and we define
AR (G; Σ) := {f ∈ C(Σ, R) : f is T -equivariant and q(supp(f )) is compact}.
We first show that AR (G; Σ) is an R-module under the pointwise operations inherited
from C(Σ, R).
Lemma 4.18. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let (Σ, i, q) be a topologically
trivial discrete twist by T ≤ R× over G. Then AR (G; Σ) is an R-submodule of C(Σ, R).
Proof. Fix f, g ∈
 AR (G; Σ) and λ ∈ R. Then λf + g is continuous and T -equivariant. Since
q supp(λf + g) is contained in the compact set q(supp(f )) ∪ q(supp(g)), we deduce that
q supp(λf + g) has compact closure. Hence λf + g ∈ AR (G; Σ).

Since we are assuming that the twist Σ is topologically trivial, it necessarily admits a
continuous global section P : G → Σ. We now show that Definition 4.17 can be rephrased
in terms of any such P .

Lemma 4.19. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let (Σ, i, q) be a topologically
trivial discrete twist by T ≤ R× over G. Let P : G → Σ be any continuous global section.
Then
AR (G; Σ) = {f ∈ C(Σ, R) : f is T -equivariant and f ◦ P ∈ Cc (G, R)}.
Proof. Fix f ∈ C(Σ, R). Then f ◦ P is continuous. It suffices to show that q(supp(f )) =
supp(f ◦ P ), because then q(supp(f )) is compact if and only if f ◦ P ∈ Cc (G, R). By
Proposition 4.8(c), we know that Σ = {z · P (α) : (α, z) ∈ G × T }. Therefore, we have
q(supp(f )) = {q(ε) : ε ∈ Σ, f (ε) 6= 0}
= {q(z · P (α)) : (α, z) ∈ G × T, f (z · P (α)) 6= 0}
= {α : (α, z) ∈ G × T, z f (P (α)) 6= 0}
= {α ∈ G : (f ◦ P )(α) 6= 0}
= supp(f ◦ P ),

Remarks 4.20 (On the relationship with the classical setting).
(1) It is crucial here that we are dealing with discrete twists. Suppose that σ is a Tvalued 2-cocycle on an ample Hausdorff groupoid G that is continuous with respect
to the standard topology on T, and consider the classical twist G ×σ T over G.
Suppose that f ∈ C(G ×σ T) is a T-equivariant function that is locally constant.
Then, for any α ∈ G, there is an open subset V of G containing α and an open
subset W of T containing 1 such that f is constant on V × W . Since W is open in
the standard topology on T, we have W 6= {1}. For each z ∈ W \{1}, we have
f (α, 1) = f (α, z) = f (z · (α, 1)) = z f (α, 1),
and hence f |G×{1} ≡ 0. But this implies that f (β, w) = 0 for all (β, w) ∈ G ×σ T,
because f is T-equivariant. In other words, if singleton sets are not open in T, then
the only locally constant T-equivariant function on G ×σ T is the zero function.
(2) It is also crucial that Definition 4.17 differs from the C∗ -algebraic analogue defined
in [32, Definition 11.1.7 and Theorem 11.1.11], which is a C∗ -completion of the subalgebra of continuous compactly supported T-equivariant functions on a (classical)
twist over G. To see why the compact-support condition would not be appropriate in the discrete setting, suppose that G is an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and
that σ : G(2) → Td is a continuous 2-cocycle. Since Td has the discrete topology,
nonzero functions in ACd (G; G ×σ Td ) are not compactly supported. To see this, fix
f ∈ ACd (G; G ×σ Td ) such that f (α, w) 6= 0 for some (α, w) ∈ G ×σ Td . Then, for
all z ∈ Td , we have

f (α, z) = f (α, z w w) = f (z w) · (α, w) = z w f (α, w) 6= 0.
Thus {α} × Td is a closed subset of supp(f ) which is not compact (because Td is
not compact), and hence f is not compactly supported.
Proposition 4.21. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let (Σ, i, q) be a topologically
trivial discrete twist by T ≤ R× over G. Let P : G → Σ be any continuous global section.
There is a multiplication (called convolution) on the R-module AR (G; Σ), given by
X
(f ∗Σ g)(ε) :=
f (εP (γ)) g(P (γ)−1 ),
(4.7)
γ∈Gs(q(ε))

under which AR (G; Σ) is an R-algebra. We call AR (G; Σ) the twisted Steinberg algebra
associated to the pair (G, Σ). If R has a T -inverse involution r 7→ r, then there is also an

22

ARMSTRONG, CLARK, COURTNEY, LIN, MCCORMICK, AND RAMAGGE

involution on AR (G; Σ), given by
f ∗ (ε) := f (ε−1 ),
under which AR (G; Σ) is a ∗-algebra over R.
Proof. By Lemma 4.18, AR (G; Σ) is an R-module. We first show that the multiplication
formula given in equation (4.7) is well-defined. To see this, fix f, g ∈ AR (G; Σ), and
suppose that P, S : G → Σ are continuous global sections. For each γ ∈ G, we have
q(P (γ)) = γ = q(S(γ)), and hence by Lemma 4.7, there exists a unique zγ ∈ T such that
P (γ) = zγ · S(γ). Fix ε ∈ Σ and γ ∈ Gs(q(ε)) . Since f and g are T -equivariant, we have


f (εP (γ)) g(P (γ)−1 ) = f zγ · (εS(γ)) g zγ−1 · S(γ)−1
= zγ f (εS(γ)) zγ−1 g(S(γ)−1 )
= f (εS(γ)) g(S(γ)−1 ),
and so the sum defining f ∗Σ g is independent of the choice of continuous global section. To
see that the sum in equation (4.7) is finite, observe that since f and g are T -equivariant,
Lemma 4.7 implies that εP (γ) ∈ supp(f ) if and only if q(ε)γ ∈ q(supp(f )), and P (γ)−1 ∈
supp(g) if and only if γ −1 ∈ q(supp(g)). Since q(supp(f )) and q(supp(g)) are compact and
Gs(q(ε)) is discrete, it follows that the set

γ ∈ Gs(q(ε)) : f (εP (γ)) g(P (γ)−1 ) 6= 0 ⊆ Gs(q(ε)) ∩ q(ε)−1 q(supp(f )) ∩ q(supp(g))−1
is finite, and hence f ∗Σ g is well-defined.
To see that AR (G; Σ) is an R-algebra, we will just show that it is closed under the
multiplication, as it is routine to check that the multiplication satisfies all of the other
necessary properties. Recall that by Proposition 4.8, P induces a continuous 2-cocycle
σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× such that the map φP : G ×σ T → Σ given by φP (α, z) := z · P (α) is
an isomorphism of twists. Fix f, g ∈ AR (G; Σ), and define fP := f ◦ P and gP := g ◦ P .
By Lemma 4.19, fP and gP are elements of Cc (G, R), which is equal (as an R-module) to
AR (G, σ −1 ), by Lemma 3.1(a). We will express the product f ∗Σ g in terms of fP ∗σ−1 gP ,
which we know is an element of AR (G, σ −1 ), by Proposition 3.2. Fix (α, z) ∈ G ×σ T .
Using T -equivariance for the second and fourth equalities and Proposition 4.8(b) for the
third equality below, we obtain

Since σ is normalised and satisfies the 2-cocycle identity, we have
σ(α, β) σ(αβ, β −1 ) = σ(α, ββ −1 ) σ(β, β −1 ) = σ(β, β −1 ),
and hence
σ(α, β) σ(β, β −1 )−1 = σ(αβ, β −1 )−1 = σ −1 (αβ, β −1 ),

for each β ∈ Gs(α) . Together, equations (4.8), (4.9), and (4.10) imply that
(f ∗Σ g)(φP (α, z)) = (f ∗Σ g)(z · P (α)) = z (fP ∗σ−1 gP )(α).

(4.11)

Define ψPf,g : G ×σ T → R by ψPf,g (α, z) := z (fP ∗σ−1 gP )(α). Since fP , gP ∈ AR (G, σ −1 ),
we have fP ∗σ−1 gP ∈ AR (G, σ −1 ) ⊆ C(G, R). Thus ψPf,g is continuous. Since φP is a
homeomorphism and f ∗Σ g = ψPf,g ◦ φ−1
P , we deduce that f ∗Σ g ∈ C(Σ, R). Taking z = 1 in
equation (4.11) shows that (f ∗Σ g) ◦ P = fP ∗σ−1 gP ∈ Cc (G, R), and Lemma 4.19 implies
that this is equivalent to showing that q(supp(f ∗Σ g)) is compact. Finally, to see that f ∗Σ g
is T -equivariant, fix z ∈ T and ε ∈ Σ. Then ε = w · P (β) for a unique pair (β, w) ∈ G ×σ T .
Thus, equation (4.11) implies that (f ∗Σ g)(ε) = w (fP ∗σ−1 gP )(β), and hence

(f ∗Σ g)(z · ε) = (f ∗Σ g) (zw) · P (β) = z w (fP ∗σ−1 gP )(β) = z (f ∗Σ g)(ε).
Therefore, f ∗Σ g ∈ AR (G; Σ), and so AR (G; Σ) is an R-algebra.
Suppose now that R has a T -inverse involution r 7→ r. We show that f ∗ ∈ AR (G; Σ).
Since f is continuous, f ∗ is a composition of continuous maps, and so f ∗ ∈ C(Σ, R). For
all z ∈ T and ε ∈ Σ, we have

f ∗ (z · ε) = f ((z · ε)−1 ) = f (z −1 ) · (ε−1 ) = z −1 f (ε−1 ) = z f ∗ (ε),
and so f ∗ is T -equivariant. Since supp(f ∗ ) = (supp(f ))−1 and q is a continuous homomor−1
phism, we have q(supp(f ∗ )) ⊆ q(supp(f )) , and hence q(supp(f ∗ )) is compact because
it is a closed subset of a compact set. Thus f ∗ ∈ AR (G; Σ). Routine calculations show that
the map ∗ : f 7→ f ∗ satisfies all of the properties of an involution on AR (G; Σ), since r 7→ r
is an involution on R. Therefore, AR (G; Σ) is a ∗-algebra over R.

We now show that isomorphic twists give rise to isomorphic twisted Steinberg algebras.
Proposition 4.22. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid. Suppose that (Σ1 , i1 , q1 ) and
(Σ2 , i2 , q2 ) are topologically trivial discrete twists by T ≤ R× over G. If ψ : Σ1 → Σ2 is an
isomorphism of twists, then the map Φ : f 7→ f ◦ ψ is an isomorphism from AR (G; Σ2 ) to
AR (G; Σ1 ). If R has a T -inverse involution, then Φ is a ∗-isomorphism.
Proof. We first show that f ◦ ψ ∈ AR (G; Σ1 ) for each f ∈ AR (G; Σ2 ). Let P1 : G → Σ1
be a continuous global
section, and define P2 := ψ ◦ P1 : G → Σ2 . Then P2 is continuous,
(0) 
(0)
(0)
P2 (G ) ⊆ ψ Σ1 = Σ2 , and since q2 ◦ ψ = q1 ,
q2 ◦ P2 = q2 ◦ (ψ ◦ P1 ) = (q2 ◦ ψ) ◦ P1 = q1 ◦ P1 = idG .
Hence P2 is a continuous global section. Fix f ∈ AR (G; Σ2 ) ⊆ C(Σ2 , R). Since ψ is
continuous, f ◦ ψ ∈ C(Σ1 , R). By Lemma 4.6, ψ respects the action of T , and hence the
T -equivariance of f implies that f ◦ ψ is T -equivariant. Moreover, Lemma 4.19 implies that
f ◦ ψ ◦ P1 = f ◦ P2 ∈ Cc (G, R), and thus f ◦ ψ ∈ AR (G; Σ1 ).
Therefore, there is a map Φ : AR (G; Σ2 ) → AR (G; Σ1 ) given by Φ(f ) := f ◦ ψ. Routine
calculations show that Φ is a homomorphism, and that if R has a T -inverse involution, then
Φ is a ∗-homomorphism. Furthermore, Φ is bijective with inverse given by Φ−1 (g) = g ◦ψ −1 ,
and hence Φ is an isomorphism (or a ∗-isomorphism).

By Proposition 4.8, we know that for every topologically trivial discrete twist Σ over an
ample Hausdorff groupoid G, there is a continuous 2-cocycle σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× such that
Σ∼
= G ×σ T . Hence AR (G; Σ) is isomorphic to AR (G; G ×σ T ), by Proposition 4.22. We
now prove that AR (G; Σ) is also isomorphic to AR (G, σ −1 ).
Theorem 4.23. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let Σ be a topologically trivial
discrete twist by T ≤ R× over G. Let P : G → Σ be a continuous global section, and let
σ : G(2) → T be the continuous 2-cocycle induced by P , as in Proposition 4.8(a). The map

24

ARMSTRONG, CLARK, COURTNEY, LIN, MCCORMICK, AND RAMAGGE

Ψ : f 7→ f ◦ P is an isomorphism from AR (G; Σ) to AR (G, σ −1 ). If R has a T -inverse
involution, then Ψ is a ∗-isomorphism.
Remark 4.24. In the C∗ -setting, some authors (for example, [6]) define the twisted groupoid
C∗ -algebra C ∗ (G; Σ) to be a C∗ -completion of the set of T-contravariant functions in Cc (Σ),
rather than T-equivariant functions; that is,
{f ∈ Cc (Σ) : f (z · ε) = z f (ε) for all z ∈ T, ε ∈ Σ},
rather than
{f ∈ Cc (Σ) : f (z · ε) = z f (ε) for all z ∈ T, ε ∈ Σ}.
As a consequence of this definition, the C∗ -analogue of Theorem 4.23 gives an isomorphism
between C ∗ (G; Σ) and C ∗ (G, σ), rather than C ∗ (G; Σ) and C ∗ (G, σ −1 ). Similarly, an alternate definition of AR (G; Σ) consisting of T -contravariant functions would result in AR (G; Σ)
being isomorphic to AR (G, σ).
Proof of Theorem 4.23. By Lemma 3.1(a), AR (G, σ −1 ) and Cc (G, R) agree as R-modules,
and hence Lemma 4.19 implies that
AR (G; Σ) = {f ∈ C(Σ, R) : f is T -equivariant and f ◦ P ∈ AR (G, σ −1 )}.

(4.12)

Therefore, there is a map Ψ : AR (G; Σ) → AR (G, σ −1 ) given by Ψ(f ) := f ◦ P .
To see that Ψ is injective, suppose that Ψ(f ) = Ψ(g) for some f, g ∈ AR (G; Σ). Fix
(α, z) ∈ G ×σ T . Since f and g are T -equivariant, we have
f (z · P (α)) = z f (P (α)) = z Ψ(f )(α) = z Ψ(g)(α) = z g(P (α)) = g(z · P (α)).

(4.13)

By Proposition 4.8(c), we have Σ = {z · P (α) : (α, z) ∈ G ×σ T }, and so equation (4.13)
implies that f = g, and hence Ψ is injective.
To see that Ψ is surjective, fix h ∈ AR (G, σ −1 ), and recall from Proposition 4.8(c) that
the map φP : G ×σ T → Σ given by φP (α, z) := z · P (α) is an isomorphism of twists. Define
f : Σ → R by f (z · P (α)) := z h(α), and fe: G ×σ T → R by fe(α, z) := z h(α). Since
−1
h ∈ C(G, R), we have fe ∈ C(G ×σ T, R), and hence f = fe ◦ φ−1
P ∈ C(Σ, R) because φP is
continuous. For all α ∈ G and z, w ∈ T , we have


f z · (w · P (α)) = f (zw) · P (α) = z w h(α) = z f (w · P (α)),
and so f is T -equivariant. We also have f ◦ P = h ∈ AR (G, σ −1 ), and thus equation (4.12)
implies that f ∈ AR (G; Σ). Since Ψ(f ) = f ◦ P = h, Ψ is surjective.
It is clear that Ψ is R-linear. We claim that Ψ is an R-algebra isomorphism. Fix
f, g ∈ AR (G; Σ). In the notation introduced in the proof of Proposition 4.21, we have
Ψ(f ) = fP and Ψ(g) = gP , and hence equation (4.11) implies that for all α ∈ G, we have
Ψ(f ∗Σ g)(α) = (f ∗Σ g)(P (α)) = (Ψ(f ) ∗σ−1 Ψ(g))(α).
So Ψ(f ∗Σ g) = Ψ(f ) ∗σ−1 Ψ(g), and thus Ψ is an isomorphism.
Suppose now that R has a T -inverse involution r 7→ r. To see that Ψ is a ∗-isomorphism,
we must show that Ψ(f ∗ ) = Ψ(f )∗ . Fix α ∈ G. By Proposition 4.8(b), we have
P (α)−1 = σ −1 (α, α−1 ) · P (α−1 ),
and hence


Ψ(f ∗ )(α) = f ∗ (P (α)) = f P (α)−1 = f σ −1 (α, α−1 ) · P (α−1 ) .

(4.14)

We also have
−1
Ψ(f )∗ (α) = σ −1 (α, α−1 )
Ψ(f )(α−1 )
= σ −1 (α, α−1 ) f (P (α−1 ))

= f σ −1 (α, α−1 ) · P (α−1 ) .

(4.15)

Together, equations (4.14) and (4.15) imply that Ψ(f ∗ ) = Ψ(f )∗ .

Corollary 4.25. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let σ : G(2) → T ≤ R× be a
continuous 2-cocycle. There is an isomorphism Ψ : AR (G; G ×σ T ) → AR (G, σ −1 ) such that
Ψ(f )(γ) = f (γ, 1) for all f ∈ AR (G; G ×σ T ) and γ ∈ G. If R has a T -inverse involution,
then Ψ is a ∗-isomorphism.
Proof. By Lemma 4.9, the map S : γ 7→ (γ, 1) is a continuous global section from G to
G ×σ T that induces σ, and so the result follows from Theorem 4.23.

Remark 4.26. If G is an ample Hausdorff groupoid, then G ×σ Td is also an ample Hausdorff groupoid for any continuous 2-cocycle σ : G(2) → Td , and hence there is an associated
(untwisted) complex Steinberg algebra A(G ×σ Td ). As a vector space, A(G ×σ Td ) is equal
to Cc (G ×σ Td , Cd ) and is dense in Cr∗ (G ×σ Td ), by [10, Proposition 4.2] and [34, Proposition 5.7]. Moreover, by Theorem 4.23, we have A(G; G ×σ Td ) ∼
= A(G, σ −1 ), and we know
−1
∗
−1
from Proposition 3.2 that A(G, σ ) is dense in Cr (G, σ ). We saw in Remarks 4.20(2)
that the only compactly supported function in A(G; G ×σ Td ) ⊆ C(G ×σ Td , Cd ) is the zero
function, and hence
A(G; G ×σ Td ) ∩ A(G ×σ Td ) = {0}.
However, this does not preclude Cr∗ (G, σ −1 ) from embedding into Cr∗ (G ×σ Td ). It would
be interesting to know how these two C∗ -algebras are related.
5. Examples of twisted Steinberg algebras
In this section we discuss two important classes of examples of twisted Steinberg algebras:
twisted group algebras and twisted Kumjian–Pask algebras.
5.1. Twisted discrete group algebras. Suppose that R is a discrete commutative unital
ring and that G is a topological group (that is, G is a group endowed with a topology with
respect to which multiplication and inversion are continuous.) Then G is an ample groupoid
if and only if G has the discrete topology, in which case, any R× -valued 2-cocycle on G is
locally constant. One defines a twist over a discrete group G via a split extension by an
abelian group A, as in [7, Chapter IV.3]. When A = R× , the twist gives rise to an R× valued 2-cocycle on G, with which one can define a twisted group R-algebra. The twisted
convolution and involution defined in Proposition 3.2 generalise those of classical twisted
group algebras over R× , and hence our twisted Steinberg algebras generalise these twisted
(discrete) group algebras. Interesting open questions about this class of algebras still exist,
even for finite groups. (See, for example, [26].) Moreover, twisted group C∗ -algebras (as
studied in [27]) have featured prominently in the study of C∗ -algebras associated with groups
and group actions; in particular, they have proved essential in establishing superrigidity
results for certain nilpotent groups (see [13]).
5.2. Twisted Kumjian–Pask algebras. For each finitely-aligned higher-rank graph (or
k-graph) Λ, there is both a C∗ -algebra C ∗ (Λ) called the Cuntz–Krieger algebra (see [29])
and a dense subalgebra KP(Λ) called the Kumjian–Pask algebra (see [1, 12]) encoding
the structure of the graph. Letting GΛ denote the boundary-path groupoid defined in
[19, 16, 36], we have
C ∗ (Λ) ∼
= A(GΛ ).
= C ∗ (GΛ ) and KP(Λ) ∼
Twisted higher-rank graph C∗ -algebras were introduced and studied in a series of papers by
Kumjian, Pask, and Sims [21, 22, 23, 24], and they provide a class of (somewhat) tractable
examples that can be used to demonstrate more general C∗ -algebraic phenomena. (See also

26

ARMSTRONG, CLARK, COURTNEY, LIN, MCCORMICK, AND RAMAGGE

[2, 17, 33].) We introduce twisted Kumjian–Pask algebras for row-finite higher-rank graphs
with no sources using a twisted Steinberg algebra approach.
Let Λ be a row-finite higher-rank graph with no sources, and let c be a continuous Tvalued 2-cocycle on Λ, as defined in [23, Definition 3.5]. Then C ∗ (Λ, c) is the C∗ -algebra
generated by a universal Cuntz–Krieger (Λ, c)-family, as defined in [23, Definition 5.2]. In
(2)
[23, Theorem 6.3(iii)], the authors describe how Λ and c give rise to a 2-cocycle σc : GΛ → T
such that
C ∗ (Λ, c) ∼
= C ∗ (GΛ , σc ).
By the last two sentences of the proof of [23, Lemma 6.3], the 2-cocycle σc is normalised
and locally constant. We define
KP(Λ, c) := A(GΛ , σc ),
and call this the (complex) twisted Kumjian–Pask algebra associated to the pair (Λ, c). By
Proposition 3.2, KP(Λ, c) is dense in C ∗ (Λ, c).
In [23, Definition 5.2], Kumjian, Pask, and Sims construct C ∗ (Λ, c) using a generatorsand-relations model involving the same generating partial isometries {tλ : λ ∈ Λ} as C ∗ (Λ),
but with the relation tµ tν = tµν replaced by tµ tν = c(µ, ν) tµν . We expect that there is a
similar construction of KP(Λ, c) using these generators and relations, but we do not pursue
this here.
6. A Cuntz–Krieger uniqueness theorem and simplicity of twisted
Steinberg algebras of effective groupoids
In this section we extend the Cuntz–Krieger uniqueness theorem and a part of the simplicity characterisation for Steinberg algebras from [5] to the twisted Steinberg algebra
setting. Throughout this section, we will assume that G is an effective ample Hausdorff
groupoid, and that R = Fd is a field endowed with the discrete topology.
Theorem 6.1 (Cuntz–Krieger uniqueness theorem). Let Fd be a discrete field, let G be
an effective ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let σ : G(2) → F×
d be a continuous 2-cocycle.
Suppose that Q is a ring and that π : AFd (G, σ) → Q is a ring homomorphism. Then π is
injective if and only if π(1V ) 6= 0 for every nonempty compact open subset V of G(0) .
Proof. It is clear that if π is injective, then π(1V ) 6= 0 for every nonempty compact open
subset V of G(0) . Suppose that π is not injective. Then there exists f ∈ AFd (G, σ) such that
(0)
f 6= 0 and π(f ) = 0. We aim to find a nonempty compact open subset V of GP
such that
π(1V ) = 0. Since σ is locally constant, we can use Lemma 3.1(b) to write f = D∈F aD 1D ,
where F is a finite collection of disjoint nonempty compact open bisections of G such that
σ(α−1 , α) is constant for all α ∈ D, and aD ∈ Fd \{0}, for each D ∈ F . Let g := 1D0−1 f for
some D0 ∈ F . Then g ∈ ker(π), because π is a homomorphism. Fix α ∈ D0 , and define
cD0 := σ(α−1 , α) aD0 6= 0. Then
g(s(α)) = g(α−1 α) = σ(α−1 , α) 1D0−1 (α−1 ) f (α) = σ(α−1 , α) aD0 = cD0 6= 0.

(6.1)

Define g0 : G → Fd by
(
g(γ)
g0 (γ) :=
0

if γ ∈ G(0)
if γ ∈ G\G(0) .

Then g0 ∈ Cc (G, Fd ) = AFd (G, σ) by Lemma 3.1(a), and supp(g0 ) = G(0) ∩ supp(g). Define
H := supp(g − g0 ) ⊆ G\G(0) . Equation (6.1) implies that s(α) ∈ supp(g0 ). Since G is
ample and effective, [5, Lemma 3.1] implies that there is a nonempty compact open subset

TWISTED STEINBERG ALGEBRAS

27

V of supp(g0 ) ∩ s(D0 ) such that V HV = ∅. Therefore, since supp(1V (g − g0 )1V ) ⊆ V HV ,
we have 1V (g − g0 )1V = 0, and hence equation (6.1) implies that
1V g 1V = 1V g0 1V = cD0 1V .

(6.2)

Thus, using that π(g) = 0, we deduce from equation (6.2) that
−1
π(1V ) = c−1
D0 π(cD0 1V ) = cD0 π(1V ) π(g) π(1V ) = 0,

as required.



Given a groupoid G, we call a subset U ⊆ G(0) invariant if, for any γ ∈ G, we have
s(γ) ∈ U ⇐⇒ r(γ) ∈ U.
We say that a topological groupoid G is minimal if G(0) has no nontrivial open invariant
subsets. Equivalently, G is minimal if and only if s(r−1 (x)) = G(0) for every x ∈ G(0) .
Theorem 6.2. Let Fd be a discrete field, let G be an effective ample Hausdorff groupoid,
and let σ : G(2) → F×
d be a continuous 2-cocycle. Then G is minimal if and only if AFd (G, σ)
is simple.
Proof. Suppose that G is minimal, and let I be a nonzero ideal of AFd (G, σ). Then I
is the kernel of some noninjective ring homomorphism of AFd (G, σ), and so Theorem 6.1
implies that there is a compact open subset V ⊆ G(0) such that 1V ∈ I. We claim that the
ideal generated by 1V is the whole of AFd (G, σ). Since the twisted convolution product of
characteristic functions on the unit space is the same as the untwisted convolution product,
the proof follows directly from the arguments used in the proof of [8, Theorem 4.1].
For the converse, suppose that G is not minimal. Then there exists a nonempty open
invariant subset U ( G(0) . The set
GU := s−1 (U ) = {γ ∈ G : s(γ) ∈ U } = {γ ∈ G : r(γ) ∈ U }

is a proper open subgroupoid of G, and so we can view I := AFd GU , σ|G(2) as a proper
U
subset of AFd (G, σ). Since U is a nonempty open set and G is ample, we can find a nonempty
compact open bisection B of G contained in U , and thus I 6= {0}, because 1B ∈ I. We claim
that I is an ideal of AFd (G, σ). Since the vector-space operations are defined pointwise, it
is straightforward to check that I is a subspace. To see that I is an ideal, fix f ∈ I and
g ∈ AFd (G, σ). Since U is invariant, we have
supp(f g) ⊆ supp(f ) supp(g) ⊆ GU G ⊆ GU ,
and so f g ∈ I. Similarly, gf ∈ I, and thus I is an ideal. (In fact, if AFd (G, σ) is a ∗-algebra,
then I is a ∗-ideal.)

Remark 6.3. By [5, Theorem 4.1], the untwisted complex Steinberg algebra A(G) is simple
if and only if G is minimal and effective. Note that Theorem 6.2 does not give necessary
and sufficient conditions on G and σ for simplicity of twisted Steinberg algebras. This is a
hard problem. We expect, as in the C∗ -setting of [23, Remark 8.3], that there exist simple
twisted Steinberg algebras for which the groupoid G is not effective.
7. Gradings and a graded uniqueness theorem
In this section we describe the graded structure that twisted Steinberg algebras inherit
from the underlying groupoid, and we prove a graded uniqueness theorem. The arguments
are similar to those used in the untwisted setting (see [8]). Let Γ be a discrete group, and
suppose that c : G → Γ is a continuous groupoid homomorphism (or 1-cocycle). Then we

28

ARMSTRONG, CLARK, COURTNEY, LIN, MCCORMICK, AND RAMAGGE

call G a Γ-graded groupoid , and we define Gγ := c−1 (γ) for each γ ∈ Γ. Since c is continuous
and Γ is discrete, each Gγ is clopen. Since c is a homomorphism, we have
G−1
γ = Gγ −1

and

Gζ Gη ⊆ Gζη

for all γ, ζ, η ∈ Γ. Note that all groupoids are graded with respect to the groupoid homomorphism into the trivial group.
Proposition 7.1. Let G be an ample Hausdorff groupoid, and let σ : G(2) → R× be a
continuous 2-cocycle. Suppose that Γ is a discrete group and c : G → Γ is a continuous
groupoid homomorphism. For each γ ∈ Γ, define the set of homogeneous elements of
degree γ by
AR (G, σ)γ := {f ∈ AR (G, σ) : supp(f ) ⊆ Gγ }.
Then AR (G, σ) is a Γ-graded algebra.
Proof. It is clear that AR (G, σ)γ is an R-submodule of AR (G, σ), for each γ ∈ Γ. Since
AR (G, σ) and AR (G) agree as R-modules, the argument used in the proof of [8, Lemma 2.2]
can be used to show that every f ∈ AR (G, σ) can be expressed as an R-linear combination
of homogeneous elements. Thus, to see that
M
AR (G, σ) =
AR (G, σ)γ ,
γ∈Γ

it suffices to show that any finite collection
{fi ∈ AR (G, σ)γi : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and each γi is distinct from the others}
is linearly independent. But this is clear, because supp(fi ) ∩ supp(fj ) = ∅ when i 6= j. Fix
ζ, η ∈ Γ. For all f ∈ AR (G, σ)ζ and g ∈ AR (G, σ)η , we have
supp(f g) ⊆ supp(f ) supp(g) ⊆ Gζ Gη ⊆ Gζη ,
and hence
AR (G, σ)ζ AR (G, σ)η ⊆ AR (G, σ)ζη .

As in the untwisted setting [8, Theorem 3.4], the graded uniqueness theorem follows from
the Cuntz–Krieger uniqueness theorem. Note that if e is the identity of Γ, then Ge is a
clopen subgroupoid of G, and so we can identify AR (G, σ)e with AR (Ge , σ), just as we can
identify AR (Ge ) with AR (G)e .
Theorem 7.2 (Graded uniqueness theorem). Let Fd be a discrete field, let G be an ample
Hausdorff groupoid, and let σ : G(2) → F×
d be a continuous 2-cocycle. Let Γ be a discrete
group with identity e, and suppose that c : G → Γ is a continuous groupoid homomorphism
such that the subgroupoid Ge is effective. Suppose that Q is a Γ-graded ring and that
π : AFd (G, σ) → Q is a graded ring homomorphism. Then π is injective if and only if
π(1K ) 6= 0 for every nonempty compact open subset K of G(0) .
Proof. It is clear that if π is injective, then π(1K ) 6= 0 for every nonempty compact open
subset K of G(0) . Suppose that π is not injective. We claim that there exists f ∈ AFd (Ge , σ)
such that f 6= 0 and π(f ) = 0. To see this, fix g ∈ ker(π) such that g 6= 0. By the proof
of Proposition
7.1, g can be expressed as a finite sum of homogeneous elements; that is,
P
g = γ∈F gγ , where F is a finite subset of Γ, and gγ ∈ AFd (G, σ)γ for each γ ∈ F . Thus,

Since π is graded, we have π(gγ ) ∈ Qγ for each γ ∈ Γ. Thus π(gγ ) = 0 for each γ ∈
Γ, because elements of different graded subspaces of Q are linearly independent. Since
g 6= 0, we can choose γ ∈ F such that gγ 6= 0. Since gγ is locally constant and Gγ is

open, there exists a compact open bisection B ⊆ Gγ such that gγ (B) = {k}, for some
k ∈ Fd \{0}. Define f := 1B −1 gγ . Since π is a homomorphism and G is graded, we have
f ∈ AFd (Ge , σ) ∩ ker(π). For all α ∈ B, we have
f (s(α)) = f (α−1 α) = σ(α−1 , α) 1B −1 (α−1 ) gγ (α) = σ(α, α−1 ) k 6= 0,
and hence f 6= 0. Thus the restriction πe of π to AFd (Ge , σ) is not injective.
Since G(0) ⊆ Ge and we have assumed that the groupoid Ge is effective, we can apply
Theorem 6.1 to the restricted homomorphism πe to obtain a nonempty compact open subset
K ⊆ G(0) such that π(1K ) = 0, as required.
