Abstract. In this paper we present a comprehensive mechanism for the emergence of
strange attractors in a two-parametric family of differential equations acting on a threedimensional sphere. When both parameters are zero, its flow exhibits an attracting heteroclinic network (Bykov network) made by two 1-dimensional connections and one 2-dimensional
separatrix between two hyperbolic saddles-foci with different Morse indices. After slightly
increasing both parameters, while keeping the one-dimensional connections unaltered, we focus our attention in the case where the two-dimensional invariant manifolds of the equilibria
do not intersect.
Under some conditions on the parameters and on the eigenvalues of the linearisation of
the vector field at the saddle-foci, we prove the existence of many complicated dynamical
objects, ranging from an attracting quasi-periodic torus to Hénon-like strange attractors, as
a consequence of the Torus-Breakdown Theory. The mechanism for the creation of horseshoes and strange attractors is also discussed. Theoretical results are applied to show the
occurrence of strange attractors in some analytic unfoldings of a Hopf-zero singularity.

1. Introduction
1.1. Strange attractors. Many aspects contribute to the richness and complexity of a dynamical system. One of them is the existence of strange attractors. Before going further, we
introduce the following notion (adapted to the situation under consideration):
Definition 1. A (Hénon type) strange attractor of a two-dimensional dissipative diffeomorphism R defined in a Riemannian manifold, is a compact invariant set Λ with the following
properties:
• Λ equals the closure of the unstable manifold of a hyperbolic periodic point;
• the basin of attraction of Λ contains an open set (and thus has positive Lebesgue
measure);
• there is a dense orbit in Λ with a positive Lyapounov exponent (exponential growth
of the derivative along its orbit);
• Λ is not hyperbolic.

A vector field possesses a strange attractor if the first return map to a cross section does.

ALEXANDRE RODRIGUES

The rigorous proof of the strange character of an invariant set is a great challenge and the
proof of the persistence (in measure) of such attractors is a very involving task. Based on [12],
Mora and Viana [38] proved the emergence of strange attractors in the process of creation
or destruction of the Smale horseshoes that appear through a bifurcation of a tangential
homoclinic point. In the present paper, rather than exhibit the existence of strange attractors,
we explore a mechanism to guarantee the existence of such complex dynamics in the unfolding
of a Bykov attractor, an expected phenomenon close to a SO(2)-equivariant system. In the
present paper, the abundance of strange attractors is a consequence of the Torus-breakdown
Theory developed in [1, 3, 4, 8]. See also [53].
1.2. The object of study. Our starting point is a two-parametric differential equation
ẋ = f(A,λ) (x) defined in the three-dimensional sphere S3 with two saddle-foci sharing all
the invariant manifolds of dimensions one and two for A = λ = 0, forming an attracting
heteroclinic network Γ with a non-empty basin of attraction U . We study the global transition
of the dynamics from ẋ = f(0,0) (x) to a smooth two-parameter family ẋ = f(A,λ) (x) that breaks
the network (or part of it). Note that, for small perturbations, the set U is still positively
invariant. When A, λ 6= 0, we assume that the one-dimensional connections persist, and the
two dimensional invariant manifolds are generically transverse (either intersecting or not).
When λ > A ≥ 0, the two-dimensional invariant manifolds meet transversely, giving rise to
a complex network, that consists of a union of Bykov cycles [17]. The dynamics in the maximal
invariant set contained in U , contains, but does not coincide with, the suspension of horseshoes
accumulating on the heteroclinic network described in [6, 31, 34, 44, 45]. In addition, close to
the organising center, the flow contains infinitely many heteroclinic tangencies and attracting
limit cycles with long periods, coexisting with sets with positive entropy, giving rise the
so called quasi-stochastic attractors. All dynamical models with quasi-stochastic attractors
were found, either analytically or by computer simulations, to have tangencies of invariant
manifolds [24]. Recently, there has been a renewal of interest of this type of heteroclinic
bifurcation in the reversible [21, 31, 37], equivariant [34, 44, 45] and conservative [13] contexts.
The novelty: The case A > λ ≥ 0 corresponds to the situation where the two-dimensional
invariant manifolds do not intersect, which has not been yet studied. Although the network
Γ associated to the equilibria is destroyed, complex dynamics appears near the ghost of it. In
the present article, it is shown that the perturbed system may manifest regular behavior corresponding to the existence of a smooth invariant torus, and may also have chaotic regimes.
In the region of transition from regular behavior (attracting torus) to chaotic dynamics (suspended horseshoes), using known results about Arnold tongues, we prove the existence of
lines with homoclinic tangencies to dissipative periodic solutions, responsible for the existence of persistent strange attractors nearby. This phenomenon has already been observed
by [52, 53] in the context of non-autonomous differential equations. Our theoretical results
may be applied in specific unfoldings of the Hopf-zero singularity (Case III of [25]).
1.3. This article. We study the dynamics arising near a differential equation with a specific
attracting heteroclinic network (Bykov attractor). We show that, when a two-dimensional
connection is broken with a prescribed configuration, the dynamics undergoes a global transition from regular to chaotic dynamics.
We discuss the global bifurcations that occur as the parameters (A, λ) vary. We complete
our results by reducing our problem to that of a first return map having an attracting (noncontractible) curve and we study its generic bifurcations. As we will see in Section 9, the

FROM AN ATTRACTING TORUS TO STRANGE ATTRACTORS

3

mechanism of the transition from regular dynamics to chaotic dynamics is not so standard
as in [42, 55], where just saddle-node, periodic doubling and Newhouse bifurcations were
involved in the the annihilation of hyperbolic horseshoes.
This article is organised as follows. In Section 2, after some basic definitions, we describe
precisely our object of study and in Section 3 we review some literature related to it. In
Section 4 we state the main results of the article. The coordinates and other notation used
in the rest of the article are presented in Section 5. In Sections 6, 7 and 8, we prove the
main results of the manuscript. In Section 9, we describe generic ways to break an attracting
two-dimensional torus, which involve homoclinic tangencies produced by the stable and unstable manifolds of a dissipative saddle. These tangencies are the origin of persistent strange
attractors. This mechanism is discussed in Section 10 for generic unfoldings of the Hopf-zero
singularity (Case III of [25]). For the reader’s convenience, we have compiled at the end of
the paper a list of definitions in a short glossary.
Throughout this paper, we have endeavoured to make a self contained exposition bringing
together all topics related to the proofs. We have stated short lemmas and we have drawn
illustrative figures to make the paper easily readable.
2. Setting
We will enumerate the main assumptions concerning the configuration of the network and
the intersection of the invariant manifolds of the equilibria. We refer the reader to Appendix
A for precise definitions.
2.1. The organising center. For ε > 0 small, consider the two-parameter family of C 3 smooth differential equations
ẋ = f(A,λ) (x)

x ∈ S3

A, λ ∈ [0, ε]

(2.1)

where S3 denotes the unit three-sphere, endowed with the usual topology. Denote by ϕ(A,λ) (t, x),
t ∈ R, the associated flow1, satisfying the following hypotheses for A = λ = 0:
(P1) There are two different equilibria, say O1 and O2 .
(P2) The spectrum of dfx is:
(P2a) E1 and −C1 ± ω1 i where C1 > E1 > 0,

ω1 > 0,

for x = O1 ;

(P2b) −C2 and E2 ± ω2 i where C2 > E2 > 0,

ω2 > 0,

for x = O2 .

Thus the equilibrium O1 possesses a 2-dimensional stable and 1-dimensional unstable manifold and the equilibrium O2 possesses a 1-dimensional stable and 2-dimensional unstable
manifold. For M ⊂ S3 , denoting by M the topological closure of M , we also assume that:
(P3) The manifolds W u (O2 ) and W s (O1 ) coincide and W u (O2 ) ∩ W s (O1 ) consists of a
two-sphere (also called the 2D-connection).
and
1Since S3 is a compact set without boundary, the local solutions of (2.1) could be extended to R.

4

ALEXANDRE RODRIGUES

(P4) There are two trajectories, say γ1 , γ2 , contained in W u (O1 ) ∩ W s (O2 ), one in each
connected component of S3 \W u (O2 ) (also called the 1D-connections).

Figure 1. Sketch of the Bykov attractor Γ satisfying (P1)–(P4).

The two equilibria O1 and O2 , the two-dimensional heteroclinic connection from O2 to O1
refered in (P3) and the two trajectories listed in (P4) build a heteroclinic network we will
denote hereafter by Γ. This network has two cycles and is illustrated in Figure 1. This set
has an attracting character [35], this is why it will be called a Bykov2 attractor.
Lemma 2.1 ([35]). The set Γ is asymptotically stable.
Therefore, we may find an open neighborhood U of the heteroclinic network Γ having its
boundary transverse to the flow of ẋ = f(0,0) (x) and such that every solution starting in U
remains in it for all positive time and is forward asymptotic to Γ.
2.2. Chirality. There are two different possibilities for the geometry of the flow around Γ,
depending on the direction in which trajectories turn around the one-dimensional heteroclinic
connection from O1 to O2 . To make this rigorous, we need some new concepts.
Let V1 and V2 be small disjoint neighborhoods of O1 and O2 with disjoint boundaries ∂V1
and ∂V2 , respectively. These neighborhoods will be constructed with detail in Section 5.
Trajectories starting at ∂V1 \W s (O1 ) near W s (O1 ) go into the interior of V1 in positive time,
then follow the connection from O1 to O2 , go inside V2 , and then come out at ∂V2 as in
Figure 2. Let Q be a piece of trajectory like the one which has been constructed from ∂V1 to
∂V2 . Now join its starting point to its end point by a line segment as in Figure 2, forming a
closed curve, that we call the loop of Q. The loop of Q and the network Γ are disjoint closed
sets.
2The terminology Bykov is a tribute to V. Bykov who has dedicated his latest research activity to heteroclinic
cycles with similar properties to those of Γ.

Definition 2. ([35]) We say that the two saddle-foci O1 and O2 in Γ have the same chirality if
the loop of every trajectory (starting near O1 ) is linked to Γ in the sense that the two closed
sets cannot be disconnected by an isotopy. Otherwise, we say that O1 and O2 have different
chirality.
Our next assumption is topological and may be written as:
(P5) The saddle-foci O1 and O2 have the same chirality.

For r ≥ 3, denote by Xr (S3 ), the set of C r two-parameter family of vector fields on S3
satisfying Properties (P1)–(P5), endowed with the C r -topology.
2.3. Perturbing terms. With respect to the effect of the two parameters A and λ on the
dynamics, we assume that:
(P6) For A > λ ≥ 0, the two trajectories within W u (O1 ) ∩ W s (O2 ) persist.

By Kupka-Smale Theorem, generically the invariant two-dimensional manifolds W u (O2 )
and W s (O1 ) are transverse (intersecting or not). Throughout this article, we assume that:
(P7a) For A > λ ≥ 0, the two-dimensional manifolds W u (O2 ) and W s (O1 ) do not intersect.
and

(P8) The transitions along the connections [O1 → O2 ] and [O2 → O1 ] are given, in local
coordinates, by the Identity map and by
(x, y) 7→ (x, y + A + λΦ(x))

respectively, where Φ : S1 → S1 is a Morse function with at least two non-degenerate
critical points (S1 = R (mod 2π)). This assumption will be detailed later in Section 5.

For the moment, without loss of generality, let us also assume that Φ(x) = sin x, x ∈ S1 ,
which has exactly two critical points.

3. Overview
In this section, we review some known results about the bifurcation of codimension 2 under
consideration, which are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 3.
3.1. Case 1: A = λ = 0. The network Γ is asymptotically stable (see Lemma 2.1). The
two-dimensional manifolds W u (O2 ) and W s (O1 ) coincide and the global attractor of f(0,0) is
made of the equilibria O1 , O2 , and the two trajectories of [O1 → O2 ] together with a sphere
which is both the stable manifold of O1 and the unstable manifold of O2 . See Figure 1.
This attractor, the so called Bykov attractor, has a finite number of moduli of stability and
the points of its proper basin of attraction have historic behavior [18]. The coincidence of the
two-dimensional invariant manifolds of O1 and O2 prevents visits to both cycles.

3.2. Case 2: A = 0 and λ > 0. Let f(A,λ) ∈ Xr (S3 ) be a two-parameter family of vector
fields satisfying (P1)–(P6) and for which Property (P7a) does not hold. Trajectories within
W u (O1 ) ∩ W s (O2 ) are kept but the manifolds W u (O2 ) and W s (O1 ) rearrange themselves,
creating either transversal or tangential intersections. This upheaval causes an explosion of the
non-wandering set of the flow, bringing forth a countable union of suspended horseshoes inside
the set of trajectories that remain for all positive times in U . These horseshoes accumulate at

the stable/unstable manifolds of the equilibria (cf. [17, 34]). Furthermore, for a sequence of
positive parameters arbitrarily close to zero, say (λj )j , the flow associated to f(0,λj ) exhibits
homo and heteroclinic tangencies, sinks with long periods and strange attractors (cf. [36, 38,
39]).

graph of Φ(x) representing W u (O2 ) ∩ Σ; the grey line is W s (O1 ) ∩ Σ; the double bars
mean that the sides are identified.

3.3. Case 3: λ > A > 0. In this case, the manifolds W u (O2 ) and W s (O1 ) still meet transversely along at least two connections and thus the results of [34, 36, 45] still hold. The
transverse intersection of the two-dimensional invariant manifolds of the two equilibria implies that the set of trajectories that remain for all time in a small neighborhood of the Bykov
cycle contains a locally-maximal hyperbolic set admitting a complete description in terms of
symbolic dynamics, reminiscent of the results of [24, 48]. An obstacle to the global symbolic
description of these trajectories is the existence of tangencies that lead to the birth of stable
periodic solutions, as described in [23, 24, 40].
3.4. Case 4: A > λ ≥ 0. As far as we know, the cases A > λ = 0 and A > λ > 0 have
not been studied. The goal of this article is to explore these cases where there are no cycles
associated to O1 and O2 . In contrast to Cases 2 and 3, where the involved bifurcations are
related to horseshoe destruction, tangencies and Newhouse phenomena [36, 42], in Case 4 the
bifurcations are connected with the Torus-Breakdown Theory [1, 3, 4, 8]. Hence, hereafter,
we also assume that:
(P7b) A > λ ≥ 0 (or, equivalently, a =

λ
A

∈ [ 0, 1 [ ).

ALEXANDRE RODRIGUES

Under hypothesis (P8), one has (P7a) ⇔ (P7b), as noticed in Remark 5.2. When we
refer to (P7) we refer one of the above.
For r ≥ 3, we denote by XrByk (S3 ) ⊂ Xr (S3 ), the set of C r two-parameter families of vector
fields on S3 satisfying conditions (P1)–(P8). An explicit example with a two parameter
polynomial differential equation satisfying (P1)–(P7) has been given in §4.1.3.2 of [5].
Digestive remark. Constants A and λ may be interpreted as follows: as depicted in Figure
3, the first hit of W u (O2 ) and W s (O1 ) to Σ are two closed curves. In Case 4, according to
our model, the distance between the two curves can be written as A + λΦ(x), x ∈ S1 , which
may be seen as an approximation of the Melnikov function associated to the two-dimensional
invariant manifolds [25, §4.5]. The constant A gives the averaged distance between the first
hit of W u (O2 ) and W s (O1 ) in Σ; the parameter λ describes fluctuations of W u (O2 ) in Σ.
4. Main results
Let T be a neighborhood
of the Bykov attractor Γ, which exists for A = λ = 0. For ε > 0

small, let f(A,λ) (A,λ)∈[0,ε]2 be a two-parameter family of vector fields in X3Byk (S3 ) satisfying
conditions (P1)–(P8).
Theorem A. Let f(A,λ) ∈ X3Byk (S3 ). Then, there is ε̃ > 0 (small) such that the first return
map to a given cross section to Γ may be written (in local coordinates) by:
h
i
F(A,λ) (x, y) = x − Kω ln(y + A + λ sin x) (mod 2π), (y + A + λ sin x)δ + . . .

where

(x, y) ∈ D = {x ∈ R (mod 2π),

y/ε̃ ∈ [−1, 1]

and

y + A + λ sin x > 0}

and the ellipsis stand for asymptotically small terms depending on x and y which converge to
zero along their derivatives.
The proof of Theorem A is done in Section 6 by composing local and transition maps.
Since δ > 1, for A small enough, the second component of F(A,λ) is contracting and, under
an additional hypothesis, the dynamics of F(A,λ) is dominated by the family of circle maps.
Theorem B. Let f(A,λ) ∈ X3Byk (S3 ). For A > 0 small enough, if

then there is

an invariant closed curve C ⊂ D as the maximal attractor for F(A,λ) . This closed curve is not
contractible on D.
The proof of Theorem is performed in Section 7 using the Afraimovich’s Annulus Principle [3]. The curve C is globally attracting in the sense that, for every p ∈ D, there exist a
point p0 ∈ C such that

The attracting invariant curve for F(A,λ) is the graph of a smooth map and corresponds to
an attracting two-torus for the flow of (2.1). Thus, in particular:

Corollary C. Let f(A,λ) ∈ X3Byk (S3 ). For A > 0 small enough, if either Kω > 0 or λ > 0 are
sufficiently small, then:
(a) there is a persistent two-dimensional torus which is globally attracting.
(b) the dynamics of F(A,λ) induces on C a circle map. In this case, for any given interval
of unit length I, there is a positive measure set ∆ ⊂ I so that the rotation number of
F(A,λ) |C is irrational if and only if a = λ/A ∈ ∆.
Proof.

(a) The existence of an invariant torus is a direct corollary of Theorem B. Since
the torus is normally hyperbolic, its persistence follows from the theory for normally
hyperbolic manifolds developed by Hirsch et al [28].

(b) The first part of this item follows from (a); the second part, concerning the rotation
number on circle maps, may be found in Boyland [15] and Herman [27].

The previous result implies the existence of a set of positive Lebesgue measure (in the
bifurcation parameter (A, λ)) for which the torus has a dense orbit, i.e. the whole torus is a
minimal attractor.

Remark 4.1. Under a stronger hypothesis, the conclusion of Theorem D may be rephrased
as: F(A,λ) |Λ is topologically conjugate to the Bernoulli shift of m symbols, with 2 ≤ m ∈ N,
giving rise to rotational horseshoes, a particular type of horseshoes characterized by Passegi
et al [43] – see Lemma 8.2.

The proof of Theorem E is a consequence of the Torus-Breakdown Theory [1, 3, 4, 8]
combined with the results by Mora and Viana [38]. A discussion of these results will be
performed in Section 9.
An application: strange attractors in the unfolding of a Hopf-zero singularity. By
applying the previous theory, we may show the occurrence of strange attractors in a specific
case of unfoldings of a Hopf-zero singularity (Type I of [11], Case III of [25]3). Since the
hypotheses are very technical, we decide to postpone the precise result to Section 10.
5. Local and transition maps
In this section we will analyze the dynamics near the Bykov attractor Γ through local
maps, after selecting appropriate coordinates in neighborhoods of the saddle-foci O1 and O2
(see Figure 5), as done in [41].
3Care is needed to compare both works because the constants choice and signs are different.

5.1. Local coordinates. In order to describe the dynamics around the cycles of Γ, we use
the local coordinates near the equilibria O1 and O2 introduced in [36]. See also Ovsyannikov
and Shilnikov [41].
In these coordinates, we consider cylindrical neighborhoods V1 and V2 in R3 of O1 and O2 ,
respectively, of radius ρ = ε̃ > 0 and height z = 2ε̃ — see Figure 5. After a linear rescaling of
the variables, we may also assume that ε̃ = 1. Their boundaries consist of three components:
the cylinder wall parametrised by x ∈ R (mod 2π) and |y| ≤ 1 with the usual cover
(x, y) 7→ (1, x, y) = (ρ, θ, z)

and two discs, the top and bottom of the cylinder. We take polar coverings of these disks

We denote by In+ (O1 ) the upper part of the cylinder, parametrised by (x, y), y ∈ ] 0, 1] and
by In− (O1 ) its lower part.

with the direction induced by the angular coordinate in O1 .

Hypothesis (P4). Using a more general form for Ψ1→2 would complicate the computations

Remark 5.1. Our study is based on a model satisfying Hypothesis (P8). It governs the transition maps along the heteroclinic connections, being necessary to make precise computations in
(A,λ)
Sections 6, 7 and 8. The part concerning the transition along [O2 → O1 ], Ψ2→1 , corresponds
to the expected unfolding from the coincidence of the two-dimensional invariant manifolds at
f(0,0) ; this is also suggested in Figure 4 of [22].
Remark 5.2. We are now in conditions to explain why, under (P8), the hypotheses (P7a)
u (O ) ∩ Out(O )
and (P7b) are equivalent. Indeed, as suggested by Figure 6, the sets Wloc

To simplify the notation, in what follows we will sometimes drop the subscript (A, λ),
unless there is some risk of misunderstanding.

7. Proof of Theorem B

To prove the existence of an invariant and attracting smooth closed curve for F(A,λ) , we
make use if the Afraimovich Annulus Principle [3, 4]. We start by proving the existence of a
flow-invariant annulus in Out+ (O2 ) in Subsection 7.1, then we check the conditions required
by the Annulus Principle (one by one) in Subsection 7.2.

kFk = sup kF(x, y)k,
(x,y)∈ B

where k ⋆ k is the standard Euclidian norm.

Theorem 7.2 ([4]). Let G(x, y) = (x + g1 (x, y), g2 (x, y)) be a C 1 map, with x ∈ R (mod 2π),
defined on the annulus
B = {(x, y) : a ≤ y ≤ b and x ∈ R

implies that the image of the annulus B

under F(A,λ) is also an annulus bounded by two curves without folds. The subsequent image
of this annulus is self-alike too, and so on. As a result, we obtain a sequence of embedded
annuli; the contraction in the y-variable (Lemma 6.1) guarantees that these annuli intersect
in a single and smooth attracting closed curve.
8. Proof of Theorem D
In this section, under an appropriate hypothesis, we prove the existence of two rectangles
whose image under F(A,λ) overlaps with Out(O2 ) at least twice. Therefore, we obtain a
construction similar to the hyperbolic Smale horseshoe: a small tubular neighborhood of
y = 0 (in Out(O2 )) is folded and mapped into itself.

y ∈ [w1 , w2 ]}

where u1 , u2 : [w1 , w2 ] → [z1 , z2 ] are Lipschitz functions such that u1 (y) < u2 (y). The horizontal boundaries of a horizontal strip are the graphs of the maps ui ; the vertical boundaries
are the lines {wi } × [u1 (wi ), u2 (wi )]. In an analogous way, we define a vertical strip across
Out(O2 ), a vertical rectangle, with the roles of x and y reversed.
We may deduce (by construction) that:
(1) For i = 1, 2, as suggested in Figure 9, the horizontal strip
Hi = {(y, x) ∈ D : x ∈ Ii }.

is mapped (homeomorphically) by F(A,λ) into a vertical strip across R ⊂ Out(O2 ).
(2) F(A,λ) (H1 ) ∩ F(A,λ) (H2 ) = ∅ because F(A,λ) is a diffeomorphism, where it is well
defined.

In what follows, we describe generic mechanisms to break an attracting two-dimensional
torus which involves the onset of homoclinic tangencies produced by the stable and unstable
manifolds of a dissipative saddle4. These tangencies are the source of strange attractors.
We address the reader to [1, 3, 4, 8] for more information on the subject. A comprehensive
description of these phenomena has been given by Shilnikov et al [50].

ALEXANDRE RODRIGUES

Within the region above, for eack k ∈ N, we may define an Arnold tongue (or resonance
wedge), denoted by Tk , adjoining the horizontal axis at a point Ak = (exp(−2πk), 0). Parameters within this wedge correspond to Poincaré maps with at least a pair of fixed points; one
of the fixed points is always of saddle-type (say Qk ); the other point is a sink (say Pk ). We
suppose just one pair of fixed points for the following analysis (as shown in Figure 11).
The borders of the Arnold tongue Tk are the bifurcation curves B1k and B2k on which the
fixed points merge to a saddle-node. The curve B2k continue up to the line λ/A = 1, while
the curve B1k bends to the left staying below λ/A = 1. Eventually these curves may touch
the corresponding curves of other tongue, meaning that there are parameter values for which
the periodic points of periods k and m coexist, m, k ∈ N.
The points M1k and M2k correspond to pre-wiggles: below these points, in B1k and B2k , the
limit set of W u (Qk ) is the saddle-node itself and is homeomorphic to a circle. Above this
point, the maximal invariant set is not homeomorphic to a circle. There is also a curve, say
D k , above which the invariant torus (or the curve C) no longer exists due to period doubling
bifurcation process [7].
In the next subsection we will emphasise the role played by the lines Homk1 , Homk2 and S k ,
also depicted in Figure 11.
9.2. Strange attractors. Continuing the process of dissecting an Arnold tongue, the authors
of [1, 7] describe generic mechanisms by which the invariant and attracting torus is destroyed.
Two of them are revived in the next result and involve homoclinic tangencies – routes [PA]
and [PB] of [7].

λ
,
Theorem 9.1 ([1, 7], adapted). For Kω0 > 0 fixed, in the bifurcation diagram − ln A, A
within Tk :
(1) there are two curves Homk1 and Homk2 corresponding to a homoclinic tangency associated to a dissipative periodic point of the first return map F(A,λ) .
(2) there is one curve S k corresponding to a homoclinic tangency (of third class) associated
to a dissipative periodic point of the first return map F(A,λ) .
Along the bifurcation curves Homk1 and Homk2 , one observes a homoclinic contact of the
components W s (Qk ) and W u (Qk ), where Qk is a dissipative saddle, as illustrated in Figure
11(right). The curves Homk1 and Homk2 divide the region above D k into two regions with
simple and complex dynamics. In the zone above the curves Homk1 and Homk2 , there is a fixed
point Qk exhibiting a transverse homoclinic intersection, and thus the corresponding map
F(A,λ) exhibits nontrivial hyperbolic chaotic sets. Other stable points of large period exist in
the region above the curves Homk1 and Homk2 since the homoclinic tangencies arising in these
lines are generic [19, 40]. The curve S k corresponds to a homoclinic tangency of third class
meaning that there are tangencies associated to the fixed points which have emerged from the
period-doubling bifurcation at D k (see the meaning of D k in Subsection 9.1). Again, above
λ
these curves, in the parameter space (− ln A, A
), there is a dense set of parameters for which
the map F(A,λ) has infinitely many sinks.
The next result will be used to finish the proof of Theorem E:

Theorem 9.2 ([38]). Let (fµ )µ a one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms on a surface S and
suppose that for fµ0 has a homoclinic tangency associated to a dissipative periodic point q ∈ S.

FROM AN ATTRACTING TORUS TO STRANGE ATTRACTORS

27

Then, under generic conditions, there is a positive Lebesgue measure set E of parameter values
near µ0 such that for all µ ∈ E, the diffeomorphism fµ exhibits a Hénon-like strange attractor
near the orbit of tangency (with an ergodic SRB measure).
By Theorem 9.1, the existence
of Homk1 , Homk2 and S k shows that there are curves in

λ
the space of parameters A, A for which the corresponding first return map has a quadratic
(generic) homoclinic tangency associated to a dissipative periodic point of the first return map
F(A,λ) . Using now Theorem 9.2, there exists a positive measure set ∆ of parameter values, so
that for every a ∈ ∆, F(A,λ) admits a strange attractor of Hénon-type with an ergodic SRB
measure. This completes the proof of Theorem E.
Remark 9.3. In this type of result, the number of connected components with which the
strange attractors intersect the section Out(O2 ) is not specified nor is the size of their basins
of attraction.
Remark 9.4. In (P4) we have asked for the existence of two 1D-connections. Nevertheless
the statements of Theorems B, D and E still hold if (P4) is replaced by:
(P4a) There is one trajectory contained in W u (O1 ) ∩ W s (O2 ),
(A,λ)

in Section 10.

10. An application: Hopf-zero singularity unfolds strange attractors
In this section, we prove the existence of strange attractors in particular analytic unfoldings
of a Hopf-zero singularity. In order to improve the readability of the paper, we recall to the
reader the most important steps about unfoldings of a Hopf-zero singularity.
f∗

From now on, we consider Hopf-Zero singularities, that is, three-dimensional vector fields
in R3 such that:
• O ≡ (0, 0, 0) is an equilibrium of f ⋆ ;
• the spectrum of df ∗ (0, 0, 0) is {±iω, 0}, with ω > 0.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that:


Observe that the lowest codimension singularities in R3 with a three-dimensional center
manifold are the ones whose linear part is linearly conjugated to (10.1).

Takens [51] proved that there are six topological types for the normal form (10.4), but
from now on, we are only interested in the one characterized by the conditions b = −1 and
a > 0 (Type I of [11]; Case III of [25]). The line defined by r = 0 (z-axis) is flow-invariant.

meaning that there is a family of non-trivial periodic solutions limiting the inner part
of the planar heteroclinic cycle associated to p1 and p2 . This cycle is Lyapunov stable
– see Figure 12(b).
The truncated normal form of order 2 is not enough to our purposes because the heteroclinic
cycle is not asymptotically stable.
10.2. Truncating at order 3. Truncating at third order any generic unfolding of (10.4)
with a > 0 and b = −1, we obtain:

10.3. General perturbations. Adding the angular coordinate θ to equation (10.6), we define a SO(2)-equivariant vector field, say f(µ1 ,µ2 ) . Its flow has cycle associated to the lift of
p̃1 and p̃2 , say O1 and O2 with non-empty basin of attraction. This cycle is made by one 1D
and one 2D heteroclinic connections associated to two hyperbolic saddles-foci with different
Morse indices. The coincidence of the invariant manifolds of the hyperbolic saddle-foci is
exceptional and they are expected to split.
Generic analytic unfoldings of the Hopf-zero singularities were considered in [21]; the au√
thors introduced an extra parameter ε = µ2 and obtained a singular perturbation problem
with a pure rotation when ε = 0 or a family with rotation speed tending to +∞ as ε → 0.
Since the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the vector field at the equilibria has the form
O(1/ε), this means that Kω → 0; details in Section 3 of [21]. In the present work, we are
interested in particular unfoldings of a Hopf-zero singularity.

Definition 3. A Gaspard-type unfolding of a Hopf-zero singularity f ⋆ (with a > 0 and b = −1
in (10.4)) has the form:







ż = µ2 − r 2 − z 2 + er 2 z + f z 3 + O(ε)H3 (r, z)
where H1 , H2 , H3 are arbitrary smooth functions of degree greater than three in the variables
r and z (i.e. they have the form of equations (2.15) and (2.16) of Gaspard [22]).

Proposition 10.1. Let f ⋆ be a Hopf-zero singularity (with a > 0 and b = −1 in (10.4)). Then
there exists an analytic curve S in the parameter space (µ1 , µ2 ) and a domain W contained in
a wedge shaped neighborhood of S such that: if (µ1 , µ2 ) ∈ W then any Gaspard-type unfolding
of f ⋆ contains strange attractors (of Hénon-type) with an ergodic SRB measure.
In the following proof, Hypothesis (P8) is implicit; it corresponds to the expected unfolding from the coincidence of the two-dimensional invariant manifolds of the equilibria; see
Remark 5.1.
Proof. We apply Theorem E to prove Proposition 10.1. Indeed, if (µ1 , µ2 ) ∈ AHC =: S, then
the flow of f(µ1 ,µ2 ) satisfies:
• there are two hyperbolic saddle-foci O1 and O2 satisfying (P1)–(P2);

• the manifolds W u (O2 ) and W s (O1 ) coincide and one branch of W u (O1 ) coincide with
W s (O2 ) – see Remark 9.4. In particular, there is a heteroclinic cycle associated to O1
and O2 with non-empty basin of attraction, meaning that (P3)–(P4a) are satisfied;

• by construction on the way the angular coordinate is acting on (10.6), the saddle-foci
have the same chirality – (P5) is valid;
• by hypothesis, we perturb f(µ1 ,µ2 ) in such a way that the manifolds W u (O2 ) and
W s (O1 ) do not intersect and the one-dimensional manifolds are preserved, emerging
an attracting 2-torus. The dynamics on it exhibits intervals of frequency locking
and irrational flow as the rotation number varies. This perturbation correspond to
(P6)–(P7).
Adding the O(ε)-terms will correspond to generic perturbations (without symmetry) that
break the attracting two-dimensional torus [25]. Observe that limε→0 Kω = +∞ since the
imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the vector field at the equilibria has the form O(1/ε) (cf.
pp. 4444 of [21]). By Theorem E, the result follows, where the parameter ε plays the role of
λ.

Remark 10.2. Besides the break of the two-dimensional attracting torus, adding generic O(ε)terms to f(µ1 ,µ2 ) may imply that the 1D-connection is also broken. This does not affect the
proof of Proposition 10.1 since the existence of strange attractors has been obtained via
Torus-breakdown phenomena, which occur even when the 1D-connection is broken.
Theorem E cannot be applied directly for generic unfoldings of the Hopf-zero singularity
because there is no chance to express a generic Hopf-zero singularities as perturbations of a
vector field whose flow has an attracting heteroclinic cycle.

32

ALEXANDRE RODRIGUES

10.4. Discussion and conjecture. Following Bonckaert and Fontich [14], when the scaling
parameters defined in [21] tend to 0, the invariant manifolds have a limit position given by
the invariant manifolds of the equilibria at the 2-jet of the singularity when z > 0. Therefore,
for any generic unfolding of the Hopf-zero singularity (Type I of [11]), the splitting distance is
well defined for the 1D and 2D-connections. The first case was obtained in [9] – the distance
S 1 between the 1D invariant manifolds is exponentially small with respect to ε > 0 and
the coefficient in front of the dominant term depends on the full jet of the singularity. The
splitting function for the 2D invariant manifolds, say S 2 , has been obtained in [10].
When the manifolds W u (O2 ) and W s (O1 ) intersect transversely, conclusive results are
given in [11]: any generic analytic unfolding of a Hopf-zero singularity exhibits Shilnikov
bifurcations and strange attractors [16, 29].
When the two-dimensional manifolds of the saddle-foci do not intersect (see [10] and case
σ ≫ O(ε) of [11]6), there exist trapping regions which prevent the existence of Shilnikov
homoclinic cycles. In particular, the route Shilnikov bifurcations ⇒ Strange attractors is
not possible. With that configuration (the invariant manifolds of the saddle-foci do not
intersect), the existence of suspended horseshoes may be ensured by our Theorem D provided
its hypotheses are satisfied – see Remark 9.4. Distances S 1 ([9]) and S 2 ([10]) have to be
introduced in the definition of the transition maps. We conjecture that generic analytic
unfoldings of a Hopf-zero singularity also include strange attractors created by the Torusbreakdown mechanism. We defer this task for a future work.

Appendix A. Glossary
For ε > 0 small, consider the two-parameter family of C 3 -smooth autonomous differential
equations
ẋ = f(A,λ) (x)
x ∈ S3
A, λ ∈ [0, ε]
(A.1)
Denote by ϕ(A,λ) (t, x), t ∈ R, the associated flow.
A.1. Symmetry. Given a group G of endomorphisms of S3 , we will consider two-parameter
families of vector fields (f(A,λ) ) under the equivariance assumption f(A,λ) (γx) = γf(A,λ) (x)
for all x ∈ S3 , γ ∈ G and (A, λ) ∈ [0, ε]2 . For an isotropy subgroup Ge < G, we will write
e for the vector subspace of points that are fixed by the elements of G.
e Observe that,
Fix(G)
e is flow-invariant.
for G−equivariant differential equations, the subspace Fix(G)

A.2. Attracting set. A subset Ω of a topological space MTfor which there exists a neighborhood U ⊂ M satisfying ϕ(t, U ) ⊂ U for all t ≥ 0 and t ∈ R+ ϕ(t, U ) = Ω is called an
attracting set by the flow ϕ, not necessarily connected. Its basin of attraction, denoted by
B(Ω) is the set of points in M whose orbits have ω−limit in Ω. We say that Ω is asymptotically stable (or that Ω is a global attractor ) if B(Ω) = M. An attracting set is said to

be quasi-stochastic if it encloses periodic solutions with different Morse indices, structurally
unstable cycles, sinks and saddle-type invariant sets.
A.3. Heteroclinic structures. Suppose that O1 and O2 are two hyperbolic saddle-foci of
f(A,λ) with different Morse indices (dimension of the unstable manifold). There is a heteroclinic
cycle associated to O1 and O2 if W u (O1 ) ∩ W s (O2 ) 6= ∅ and W u (O2 ) ∩ W s (O1 ) 6= ∅. For
i, j ∈ {1, 2}, the non-empty intersection of W u (Oi ) with W s (Oj ) is called a heteroclinic
connection between Oi and Oj , and will be denoted by [Oi → Oj ]. Although heteroclinic
cycles involving equilibria are not a generic feature within differential equations, they may
be structurally stable within families of systems which are equivariant under the action of a
compact Lie group G ⊂ O(n), due to the existence of flow-invariant subspaces [25].
A.4. Bykov cycle. A heteroclinic cycle between two hyperbolic saddle-foci of different Morse
indices, where one of the connections is transverse (and so stable under small perturbations)
while the other is structurally unstable, is called a Bykov cycle. A Bykov network is a
connected union of heteroclinic cycles, not necessarily in finite number. We refer to [30] for
an overview of heteroclinic bifurcations and substantial information on the dynamics near
different kinds of heteroclinic cycles and networks.
A.5. Suspended horseshoe. Given (A, λ) ∈ [0, ε]2 , suppose that there is a cross-section Sλ
to the flow ϕ(A,λ) such that S(A,λ) contains a compact set K(A,λ) invariant by the first return
map F(A,λ) to S(A,λ) . Assume also that F(A,λ) restricted to K(A,λ) is conjugate to a full shift
on a finite alphabet. Then the suspended horseshoe associated to K(A,λ) is the flow-invariant
^
set K
(A,λ) = {ϕλ (t, x) : t ∈ R, x ∈ K(A,λ) }.
A.6. SRB measure. Given an attracting set Ω for a continuous map R : M → M of a
compact manifold M, consider the Birkhoff average with respect to the continuous function
T : M → R on the R-orbit starting at x ∈ M:
n−1

L(T, x) = lim

n∈N

1X
T ◦ Ri (x).
n

(A.2)

i=0

Suppose that, for Lebesgue almost all points x ∈ B(Ω), the limit (A.2) exists and is
independent on x. Then L is a continuous linear functional in the set of continuos maps from
M to R (denoted by C(M, R)). By the Riesz Representation Theorem, it defines a unique
probability measure µ such that:
Z
n−1
1X
i
T dµ
(A.3)
T ◦ R (x) =
lim
n∈N
n
Ω
i=0

for all T ∈ C(M, R) and for Lebesgue almost all points x ∈ B(Ω). If there exists an ergodic
measure µ supported in Ω such that (A.3) is satisfied for all continuous maps T ∈ C(M, R)
for Lebesgue almost all points x ∈ B(Ω), where B(Ω) has positive Lebesgue measure, then µ
is called a SRB measure and Ω is a SRB attractor.
