We consider a mathematical model for a two-particle system driven by the spatial gradient of
a concentration field of chemicals with conservative attractive interactions in one dimension. This
setup corresponds to an experimental system with floating camphor particles at a water surface.
Repulsive interaction is introduced, as well as self-propelling force, through the concentration field
of camphor molecules at the water surface. Here we newly adopt the attractive lateral capillary
force due to the deformation of the water surface. The particles experience competing dissipative
repulsion and conservative attraction. We numerically investigated the mathematical model, and
found six different modes of motion. The theoretical approach revealed that some of such mode
transitions can be understood in terms of bifurcation.

INTRODUCTION

Active matter is already a wide-spread concept, which
treats a group of motile elements[1, 2] as a novel type
of matter[3]. Active matter includes a group of biological objects, such as a school of fish, a flock of birds, and
a colony of cells[4]. Therefore, it attracts interest even
from non-physicists. Motility induced phase separation
is one of the concepts found in active matter[5]. The
active Brownian particles[6, 7], particles self-propelled
with a finite speed under external noise, show phase
separation[5, 8, 9] only with local repulsive interaction.
The system shows dynamic spatio-temporal patterns due
to the competition of conservative local repulsion and
dissipative driving force, which violates momentum conservation. It is notable that such competition is peculiar
to active matter where far-from-equilibrium condition is
imposed.
Dissipative effects can induce particle-particle interaction, as well as self-propulsion. Here, we focus our attention to the interaction through concentration fields.
One of the examples is an interaction between cells[10–12]
through diffused molecules. These cells release molecules
to their environment, and each cell reacts to the concentration fields of the released molecules. The reaction includes the change of their self-propulsion, and additional
release and/or consumption of the molecules. Finally,
these cells spontaneously form a macroscopic bacterial

colony with well-organized structures[13–16].
Apart from biological systems, a camphor-water system is a well-studied self-propelled system where the particle can interact through a concentration field[17–19].
Camphor is a surface active chemical with sublimability. When a camphor particle is put at a water surface,
camphor molecules are released from the particle, and
reduce the surface tension of the water surface. Sublimation of camphor prevents the saturation of the water
surface with the camphor molecules. When a symmetrically shaped camphor particle, e.g. a circular-shaped
particle, is at rest, the surface tension balances around
the particle. Thus the rest state of a symmetric camphor
particle can exist. By perturbating the resting camphor
particle, the concentration field of camphor molecules becomes asymmetric. Such an asymmetric profile of the
concentration field can drive the particle through the
surface tension. A positive feedback loop between the
motion and the asymmetry in the concentration profile leads to continuous motion when the resistant force
is small enough. These processes are described with a
simple mathematical model based on a reaction-diffusion
equation[20–25]. The same type of model can be applied
for other self-propelling chemical systems[26–29] driven
by the imbalance of surface tension. The model can
also be regarded as a model for a chemotactic motion,
in which a particle moves in the direction of the gradient
of chemical concentration, and thus it is not only a model
for the camphor-water system, but also a generic model
for the system in which the particles move depending on
the concentration field around them[30].
When multiple camphor particles are placed on a water

surface, they interact through the concentration field of
camphor molecules[31–38]. The interaction is essentially
repulsive, since they are driven in the direction with a
lower concentration of camphor molecules. In this case,
the repulsive interaction is effective in the range of the
diffusion length `D , determined by the diffusion coefficient D, and sublimation rate α, as `D = (D/α)1/2 [22].
It should be noted that the concentration gradient of the
surface active chemical component induces Marangoni
convection[39], and it transports the chemical component
itself. Due to this effect, the transport of the chemical component is enhanced. This effect can be included
in the “effective” diffusion term under the assumption
that the system is close to the steady state[40, 41], and
D in the present paper is the effective diffusion coefficient including the Marangoni effect. This mathematical model is commonly used to describe self-propulsion
in the camphor-water system. Many characteristic collective behaviors of multiple camphor particles can be
described with the same type of mathematical model including the effective diffusion coefficient[42–45].
Interestingly, any particles floating at a surface show
conservative interaction due to the deformation of the
surface; so-called lateral capillary force[46, 47]. The lateral capillary force appears to minimize the surface energy of water, and its direction is determined by the types
of meniscus: convex and concave. The lateral capillary
force is attractive (repulsive) for the same (different) type
of meniscus. The lateral capillary force is effective in the
range of the capillary length q −1 , determined by surface

tension γ, density ρ, and gravitational acceleration g, as
1/2
q −1 = (γ/(ρg))
[48]. Particles with similar physical
characteristics, such as wettability and density, have the
same type of meniscus and, hence, the interaction is attractive.
Overall, the conservative attractive and dissipative repulsive forces can compete in the camphor-water systems. As mentioned, such competition can be relevant
to active matter system, but overlooked up to now. In
this study, we consider the modes of motion for two camphor particles in a one-dimensional system. To clarify the
competition between the attractive and repulsive forces,
we adopt the theoretical approach, where the balance of
forces is easy to change. The present paper starts from
the introduction of the mathematical model for the motion of camphor particles. Then, the modes of motion
depending on the balance between attractive and repulsive forces are numerically investigated. Finally, some
aspects of numerical results are explained by theoretical
analysis.

II.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL

We introduce a one-dimensional system with two camphor particles floating at a water surface based on the
previous work [20–23]. The particles interact with each
other through the camphor concentration field and the
lateral capillary force. In this model, the time development of the camphor particle positions xi (t) (i = 1, 2)
and the camphor surface concentration field c(x, t) are
considered.
The dynamics for the i-th camphor particle xi (t) (x1 <
x2 ) is described as below:

−Fint (l).

where l denotes the distance between the two particles
l = x2 − x1 .

(3)

Here, m, η, and r are the mass, friction coefficient, and
radius of a camphor particle[41]. In order to compromise
dimensionality of the equation, here we introduce w as
a length scale. This w corresponds to the width, the
dimension perpendicular to the considered direction x
and the direction of the gravitational acceleration in a
three-dimensional system. In the above equations, we
assume the linear relation between the surface tension γ
and the camphor surface concentration c as
γ = γ0 − Γc,

(4)

3
where γ0 is the surface tension of pure water and Γ is a
positive constant.
Fint (l) reflects the lateral capillary force[46, 47] between two camphor particles:


(9)

Here, ψ is the contact angle of the water surface around
the camphor disk, and q is the inverse of the capillary
length. We assume the surface tension modulation by
the camphor concentration, Γ, is sufficiently small, and
we do not consider the dependence of the camphor surface concentration in the calculation of the lateral capillary force. A short-range excluding volume effect of the
particle is included when l ≤ 2r. We define that Fint is
continuous at l = 2r.  is a small parameter, and the 1/
controls the strength of the repulsive force. We define
the characteristic intensity of the lateral capillary force
as ξ = 2wγ0 eqr sin2 ψ.

NUMERICAL RESULTS

The numerical calculation was performed to overview
the behavior of a two-particle system. We adopted a onedimensional system with a periodic boundary condition
to investigate the long-term behavior without the effect
of the system boundary. The system size was set as L.
Some equations should be modified to reflect the periodic
boundary condition. We introduce a function mod(z) for
a simple representation:
z = kL + mod(z),

where β is a supply rate of camphor particles per unit

the periodic boundary condition, i.e., xi (t) is replaced
with mod(xi (t)) if xi (t) < 0 or xi (t) ≥ L. It should be
noted that x1 can be greater than x2 , different from the
original model, reflecting a periodic boundary condition.
In the numerical calculation, the definition of l is also
modified to be
l = min(mod(x1 − x2 ), mod(x2 − x1 )).

FIG. 2. (a) Phase diagram for stable modes numerically obtained. We observed six characteristic modes. Each mode was
labeled as i isolated translational motion, ii clustered translational motion, iii inchworm motion, iv head-on-collision, v
standing oscillation, and vi standing cluster. Several stable
modes can be observed with the same parameters (denoted by
the sign “+”). Controlled parameters were η and ξ. The other
parameters were fixed as q = 0.4, w = 1.0, r = 0.3, Γ = 5.0,
 = 0.001, and L = 40.0. (b) Typical spatio-temporal plots for
modes in (a). Red and blue lines represent the positions of the
two particles. The values of η and ξ for the spatio-temporal
plots are (η, ξ) = i:(0.30, 0.20), ii:(0.40, 0.20), iii:(0.40, 0.44),
iv:(0.50, 0.20), v:(0.55, 0.40), and vi:(0.60, 0.40).

In addition, xi (t) (i = 1, 2) is modified by adding or subtracting L to be in the range of 0 ≤ xi (t) < L reflecting

The Crank-Nicolson scheme was used for Eqs. (11) and
(17), while the Euler method was used for Eqs. (15) and
(16). Time step and spatial mesh size were set to be 10−3
and 10−2 , respectively. Fixed parameters were q = 0.4,
w = 1.0, r = 0.3, Γ = 5.0,  = 0.001, and L = 40.0. In
this study, we fixed q < 1 so that the competition between conservative and dissipative interactions could be
observed. We fixed Γ and varied ξ and η as parameters,
since Γ represents the amplitude of the force and the ratio between η and Γ is important. The values of the other
parameters w, , L, and r do not affect the bifurcation
structure; we set   r < 1  L, where the diffusion
length is set to be unity.
We numerically investigated the dependence of the
modes on the friction coefficient η and the intensity of
the lateral capillary force ξ to observe the stable modes
of camphor particle motion. We obtained the largest parameter region for each mode of motion in the following
two manners: The one was to scan ξ with an interval of
0.02 in both (increasing and decreasing) directions while
η was fixed, and the other was to scan η in both directions with an interval of 0.01 while ξ was fixed. The
initial values of x1 , x2 , v1 , and v2 before scanning were
set to be x1 = 0, x2 = 5.0 or 20.0, v1 = v2 = 0, and
c(x) ≡ 0. When the parameter values were changed during the scanning, we did not change the values of x1 , x2 ,
v1 , and v2 , but we added a spatially-incoherent noise to
the concentration field c(x) in order to make easier to
escape from the unstable steady state. After the change
in the parameters, we ran simulation long enough to be
converged into characteristic modes.
The obtained phase diagram is shown in Fig. 2. There
are characteristic modes of camphor particles motion,
which are labeled by i isolated translational motion, ii
clustered translational motion, iii inchworm motion, iv
head-on-collision, v standing oscillation, and vi standing
cluster. The modes i and iv are characteristic to a finitesized system and should not be present in an infinite
system.
The modes i and ii are the translational motions of
two camphor particles in the same direction. The distance between the particles is L/2 and is smaller than
L/2 for modes i isolated translational motion and ii clustered translational motion, respectively. The mode iii is
the combination of translation and oscillation; so-called
inchworm motion. The modes iv and v are the oscillatory
motion. In the case of iv head-on-collision, the amplitude
of the oscillation is close to L/2, whereas the amplitude
is smaller than L/2 in the case of v standing oscillation.
Thus, the particles repeat head-on collisions twice in a

period in the case of mode iv. The mode vi is the stationary state. The particles are localized such that the
distance between particles is smaller than L/2. There
are bistable regions where several modes can be realized
with different initial conditions as shown in Fig. 2(a).
We used three order parameters to classify the modes
of motion: the difference between the distance of two
particles lmax − lmin , the average speed |v1 + v2 |/2, and
the period T . lmax and lmin are the maximum and the
minimum values of l in appropriate time span after the
sufficiently long annealing time. We denote T = 0 for the
modes without oscillation. The dependence of the order
parameters on the friction coefficient η is shown in Figs.
3 and 4, where ξ = 0.4 and 0.9, respectively.
For ξ = 0.4 (Fig. 3), three different modes can be stable
at η ≤ 0.25. Circles indicate i isolated translational motion, where lmax −lmin = 0 and average speed |v1 + v2 | /2
is finite. These order parameters indicate that the two
particles travel with a fixed distance at a finite speed. We
confirmed the distance is fixed as 20, which corresponds
to the half size of the system size L/2. Triangles, indicating ii clustered translational motion, also show a similar
behavior, while the average speed is slightly larger than
the one for circles (i). We also confirmed the distance is
kept as smaller than L/2. Crosses (iv head-on-collision)
show lmax − lmin ' L/2 = 20 and |v1 + v2 | /2 = 0. Here,
the particles show the oscillatory motion whose amplitude is approximately L/2.
For 0.26 ≤ η ≤ 0.35, triangles (ii) and crosses (iv)

can be observed. By increasing η further, squares (iii
inchworm motion) appear, instead of triangles (ii); for
0.36 ≤ η ≤ 0.46. These squares (iii) are characterized by
finite amplitude lmax − lmin together with a finite average
speed |v1 + v2 | /2. When 0.47 ≤ η, squares (iii) disappear. Close to this transition line, we observed a long
oscillation period T , which indicates the appearance of
complex oscillation discussed later (Fig. 5).
For 0.47 ≤ η ≤ 0.52, only crosses (iv) can be observed.
Crosses (iv) disappear for 0.53 ≤ η. Instead, pentagons
(v standing oscillation), or diamonds (vi standing cluster) appear in the case for 0.53 ≤ η ≤ 0.58 and 0.59 ≤ η,
respectively. Pentagons (v) are characterized by average
speed |v1 + v2 | /2 = 0, and a finite oscillation amplitude
lmax −lmin . Here, lmax −lmin < L/2, different from crosses
(iv). Diamonds (vi) are characterized by |v1 + v2 | /2 = 0
and lmax − lmin = 0, while the distance between the particles was confirmed to be smaller than L/2, indicating
the particles are clustered.
For ξ = 0.9 (Fig. 4), the behavior of the system is qualitatively similar to the one shown in Fig. 3. Triangles (ii)
and crosses (iv) were observed for η ≤ 0.49. Only triangles (ii) appear for 0.5 ≤ η ≤ 0.55. With the coexistence
at η = 0.56, there are only diamonds (vi) in η ≤ 0.57.
In the case of squares (iii), a period-doubling behavior
was observed (Fig. 5). The data shown correspond to
ξ = 0.4; the same parameters with Fig. 3. At 0.434 < η <
0.436, period-doubling bifurcation is suggested to occur.
For 0.436 ≤ η ≤ 0.446, the oscillation has two peaks in

First, we assume that the relaxation of the concentration field is much faster than the acceleration and deceleration of the particles. We construct a concentration field

The eigenvalues of the matrix appeared in Eq. (31), λ,
are obtained as
λ = σ1 (η, ξ), σ2 (η, ξ) ± iω2 (η, ξ),

where
σ1 = −η +

and σ2 are negative, the standing cluster (vi) is linearly
stable. When the sign of σ1 changes to positive, a pitchfork bifurcation occurs and a solution corresponding to
the clustered translational motion can emerge. On the
other hand, when the sign of σ2 changes to positive, a
Hopf bifurcation occurs and a solution corresponding to
the standing oscillation can emerge. Figure 6(a) shows
the phase diagram obtained by the linear stability analysis. The curves σ1 = 0 and σ2 = 0 intersect at (ηc , ξc )
as shown in Fig. 6(a). It suggests that the standing
cluster is destabilized through a pitchfork bifurcation for
ξ > ξc ' 0.818, while it is destabilized through Hopf bifurcation for ξ < ξc . Comparing Fig. 6(a) with Fig. 2, it
is said that the mode transition from the standing cluster
(vi) to the clustered translational motion (ii) and standing oscillation (v) is well reproduced.
Next, we also investigate the linear stability of the solution corresponding to the clustered translational motion.
In the same way as in the case of the standing cluster,
we set v1 = v2 = v > 0 and calculate the stationary
solution (v1 , v2 , l) = (v, v, l1 ). Unfortunately, l1 cannot
be explicitly described as an analytic function of v, and
thus we obtain a set of (v, l1 ) numerically. It should be
noted that one set of (v, l1 ) is obtained for each set of
(η, ξ) when σ1 > 0, and the values of (v, l1 ) are continuously connected to (v, l0 ) on a curve with σ1 = 0, which
means the pitchfork bifurcation at σ1 = 0 is supercritical.
Obviously, (v1 , v2 , l) = (−v, −v, l1 ) is also another solution corresponding to the clustered translational motion.
Hereafter, we only focus on the solutions which appear
through the supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at σ1 = 0,
though there may be other solutions.
In order to investigate the linear stability of the solution corresponding to the clustered translational motion,

are calculated numerically, and evaluated whether they
are real or complex and the signs of their real parts. One
of the three eigenvalues always has negative real value,
while the others are complex conjugates and the signs
change depending on the parameters. The results of the
linear stability analysis is shown in Fig. 6(b). In the case
that the standing cluster solution is firstly destabilized
through pitchfork bifurcation, i.e., ξ > ξc , the sign of
the complex eigenvalues is negative, and a stable translational cluster motion occurs. In contrast, in the case
that the standing cluster solution is firstly destabilized
through Hopf bifurcation, i.e., ξ < ξc , the sign of the real
part of the complex eigenvalues is negative for smaller
η, while it is positive for greater η, and Hopf bifurcation
occurs between them. This Hopf bifurcation corresponds

FIG. 6. Phase diagram obtained from the theoretical analysis. (a) Phase diagram obtained from the linear stability
analysis of the standing cluster (vi). The standing cluster
state (Eq. (30)) is linearly stable in the orange-colored parameter region, where both σ1 and σ2 are negative. The
crossing point of the two curves σ1 = 0 and σ2 = 0 is set
as (ηc , ξc ). For ξ > ξc , the standing cluster is destabilized
through a pitchfork bifurcation at the thick corresponding to
σ1 = 0. For 0 < ξ < ξc , it is destabilized through a Hopf bifurcation at the thin line corresponding to σ2 = 0. (b) Phase
diagram obtained from the linear stability analysis of the clustered translational state (ii). The green-colored region shows
the region where the mode (ii) exists but it is destabilized.
The left-side curve corresponds to a Hopf bifurcation from
clustered translational motion (ii) to inchworm motion (iii),
whereas the right-side curve corresponds to the boundary of
the existence of the clustered translational motion (ii).

to the transition from the clustered translational motion
(ii) for smaller η to the inchworm motion (iii) for greater
η, which is also observed in numerical results.
It is noted that there are qualitative differences between phase diagrams obtained numerically and theoretically. This discrepancy should reflect that the numerical
calculation is performed in a finite-sized system with a
periodic boundary condition.

phor molecules. A single camphor particle at a water
surface shows self-propulsion by the spontaneous symmetry breaking. In addition, the concentration fields result
in effective repulsion between particles. In this study, we
newly adopted the lateral capillary force that act as a
conservative attractive force between camphor particles.
Our numerical results revealed that two particles in
one-diemsional system show six different modes, some of
which are bistable with the same parameter for different
initial conditions. Notably, we newly found inchworm
like motion where the distance between particles oscillates while the center of mass of these particles shows a
translational motion.
The natural extension of the present study is the
Maranogoni-driven multiple-particle system with conservative attractive interactions in two dimension. Indeed, experimental study shows dynamic clustering of
Marangoni-driven agents floating at a solution surface [32–34, 50]. The extension of our model into multiple
particles in two dimension is left for the future study.
A concentration field is often used to transmit signals between actively moving elements. Bacteria release
signaling molecules, which can be detected by bacteria
themselves. They can move in response to the gradient of
the signaling molecule; so-called chemotaxis. Our model,
describing floating camphor particles, can be recognized
as the model for such chemotactic behavior with conservative long-range attraction. We believe that a group
of the diffusion-driven agents whose motion is stabilized
due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, like the present
model, should be recognized as a novel class of active
matter.

In the present paper, we considered a mathematical
model of camphor particles floating at a water surface
as a system where conservative and dissipative driving
force competes. A floating camphor particle experiences
the force directing lower surface concentration of cam-
