How far can we use multi-wavelength cross-identifications to deconvolve far-infrared images? In this short research
note I explore a test case of CLEAN deconvolutions of simulated confused 850 µm SCUBA-2 data, and explore the
possible scientific applications of combining this data with ostensibly deeper TolTEC Large Scale Structure (LSS)
survey1 1.1 mm−2 mm data. I show that the SCUBA-2 can be reconstructed to the 1.1mm LMT resolution and
achieve an 850 µm deconvolved sensitivity of 0.7 mJy RMS, an improvement of at least ∼ 1.5× over naive point source
filtered images. The TolTEC/SCUBA-2 combination can constrain cold (< 10K) observed-frame colour temperatures,
where TolTEC alone cannot.
TolTEC and SCUBA-2 images were simulated using the Cai et al. (2013) model. I used the 1.1 mm dN /dz for
> 2.1 mJy, since this is the faintest tabulation2 available, but the high-redshift tail is not strongly dependent on flux
limit. I created 850 µm [1.1 mm] zerofootprint maps (in the terminology of Serjeant et al. (2003)) and Gaussian noise
to reproduce an RMS of 0.5 mJy [0.2 mJy] once the point source filter is applied. This creates heavily confusion limited
SCUBA-2 data, but TolTEC is not confused. See Serjeant et al. (2003) for the point source filtering procedure. The
images were (159500 )2 with 100 pixels. This approximates a SCUBA-2 PONG1800 area. A starburst template SED
was used to translate 1.1 mm fluxes and redshifts to 850 µm fluxes. Fig. 1 shows extracts from the 850 µm and 1.1 mm
maps. I extracted a point source catalogue from the simulated 1.1 mm image, to a 5σ limit of 1 mJy.
I used a simple CLEAN deconvolution of the 850 µm map but with source positions pre-determined (see e.g. Hughes
et al. (1998) for CLEANing terminology), iteratively extracting best-fit fluxes at source positions from the zerofootprint map and subtracting gain times the flux of the brightest source from the zerofootprint map. I tried (0)
measuring 850 µm fluxes naively from the point-source-filtered map; (1) CLEANing using extracted 1.1 mm source
positions; (2) CLEANing using exact 1.1 mm source positions, i.e. imagining they have been cross-matched with
MIPS, AKARI, JVLA etc; (3) CLEANing using the entire catalogue of simulated source positions, i.e. a proxy for the
entire MIPS/AKARI/JVLA underlying source catalogue. The results were not sensitive to the CLEAN gain, perhaps
because the positions are fixed, so I typically used gain=0.5 and 10k-50k iterations. The results from options (1) and
(2) were intermediate between those of (0) and (3). This makes sense, in that feeding in more information gives better
results. I will only show (0) and (3) here.
The 850 µm truth image is largely empty apart from a series of delta functions, so I convolved the truth image with
the 1.1 mm TolTEC beam, and compared it to the CLEAN reconstruction at the same resolution. This is shown in the
lower-left of Fig. 1. The correspondence between the TolTEC-resolution images is very encouraging, in fact so strong
that one might question whether this is realistic.
It is helpful to recall the famous deconvolution of the Cloverleaf quasar by Magain et al. (1998) (see their Fig. 2).
As in our case, the quasar image positions have been input as a prior. This makes the deconvolution possible and
the flux measurements reliable. This method is well-tested by simulations. However, the information content is not

constant across the image. The spaces between the quasar images do not have anything like as much information
content as the modelled sources. It is only by adding extra positional information that the reconstruction is possible,
and the reconstructed images have “hidden” areas where there is little or no information.
Fig. 1 then compares the truth fluxes to extracted fluxes. The upper panel is the result of naively reading off the
850 µm fluxes from the point-source-filtered map. There is a strong Eddington bias at the faint end. The right hand
panel shows the comparison between the truth fluxes and the 850 µm TolTEC-resolution reconstructed map, using the
entire catalogue of simulated sources as prior positions. Reassuringly, the Eddington bias is alleviated. The scatter is
' 1.5× smaller than that of the point-source filtered map, despite the latter being formally optimal for isolated sources.
It seems likely that further improvements can be made using physical models of the underlying source populations and
more multi-wavelength data.
Finally, Fig. 1 compares observed colour temperatures for simulated galaxies at the sensitivities of the TolTEC LSS
survey (upper panel), and with the addition of the deconvolved SCUBA-2 fluxes (lower panel). A grey-body index
of β = 2 was assumed; different indices introduce systematics to the temperatures but do not add random noise.
In conclusion, a great deal of information on the point source population is recoverable below the formal confusion
limit, and deconvolution of ultra-deep SCUBA-2 data can be usefully synergistic with the next generation of mm-wave
continuum cameras.

Figure 1. Starting from the Cai et al. (2013) model, I simulate galaxies in a PONG1800 area, (25000 )2 segments of which
are shown. Blue circles mark the locations of 1.1mm sources extracted from simulated TolTEC LSS survey point-source-filtered
images. The point-source filtered image (top row) leads to a strong Eddington bias. Deconvolving the simulated JCMT image
leads to a striking visual correspondence with the underlying truth image (bottom left images). Fluxes measured from the
CLEANed map have ∼ ×1.5 less uncertainty than the simple PSF-convolved map, and Eddington bias is mitigated. Red lines
show the 1:1 relations. Finally, I show that the combination of TolTEC LSS data with SCUBA-2 can constrain cold colour
temperatures, while TolTEC on its own has no discriminatory power.
