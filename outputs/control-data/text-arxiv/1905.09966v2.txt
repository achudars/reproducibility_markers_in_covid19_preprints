NEW EXAMPLES OF BERNOULLI ALGEBRAIC ACTIONS
DOUGLAS LIND AND KLAUS SCHMIDT
Abstract. We give an example of a principal algebraic action of the noncommutative free group F of rank two by automorphisms of a connected compact
abelian group for which there is an explicit measurable isomorphism with the full
Bernoulli 3-shift action of F. The isomorphism is defined using homoclinic points,
a method that has been used earlier to construct symbolic covers of algebraic actions. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a Bernoulli algebraic action
of F without an obvious independent generator. Our methods can be generalized
to a large class of acting groups.

1. Introduction
Halmos [8] first observed that an continuous automorphism of a compact group
automatically preserves Haar measure, providing a rich class of examples in ergodic
theory. Using Pontryagin duality theory, it is possible to obtain explicit and concrete answers to dynamical questions. In particular, a series of papers in the 1970s
culminated in the definitive result that every ergodic automorphism of a compact
abelian group is measurably isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift [15, 19].
The study of the joint action of several commuting automorphisms of a compact
abelian group was initiated by Bruce Kitchens and the second author [14]. This
has ultimately led to a detailed understanding of such actions, called algebraic Zd actions, as described in [24]. Here there is a natural necessary condition for such
actions to be measurably isomorphic to Bernoulli shifts, namely having completely
positive entropy, and this condition can be checked using commutative algebra [16,
Thm. 6.5]. The second author and Dan Rudolph showed in [23] that this condition
is also sufficient.
For acting groups that are not commutative, much less is known. See for example
our recent survey [18] of algebraic actions of the discrete Heisenberg group. Even
for this group we do not know a general method to decide whether or not a given
algebraic action is measurably isomorphic to a Bernoulli action.
The study of actions of general countable groups, even beyond amenable groups,
has been revolutionized by Lewis Bowen’s introduction of new ideas about entropy
and independence. The recent book of Kerr and Li [13] gives a comprehensive account of these developments, in particular of how entropy can be defined for actions
of sofic groups. Algebraic actions supply a large class of interesting examples for this
theory. The study of entropy for algebraic actions of noncommutative groups was
initiated by Christopher Deninger [5], who showed that entropy could be computed
for many amenable groups using the Fuglede-Kadison determinant of an associated

operator in a von Neumann algebra. This insight was developed in a series of papers
by several authors, leading to a definitive form for algebraic actions of general sofic
groups by Hayes [9].
However, little is known about when algebraic actions of sofic groups are measurably isomorphic to Bernoulli actions. The reason for this ignorance is that many of
the essential results for the Bernoulli theory of amenable group actions due to Ornstein and Weiss [20] fail for sofic groups. For instance, factors of Bernoulli actions
may fail to be Bernoulli. A striking example of this is due to Popa [21, 22]: the
algebraic action of a countable group Γ having property (T) on the quotient of TΓ
by the subgroup of constant points is not Bernoulli (see [3, Thm. 7.2] for a succinct
explanation).
In this paper we construct an explicit measurable isomorphism between an algebraic action of the (noncommutative) free group F of rank two on a connected
compact abelian group and the full 3-shift action of F which preserves the respective
measures. We believe that this is the first nontrivial example of this sort, where there
is no obvious independent generator. Our proof uses symbolic covers, homoclinic
points, and a percolation argument from [7, Prop. 5.1]. That argument relies on
the fact that for expansive algebraic Zd -actions Haar measure is the unique measure
of maximal entropy. However it an open question whether this remains true for F.
Here we give an alternative argument, showing that the image of the 3-shift measure
is invariant under translations by all elements in the dense homoclinic group, and
hence it must be Haar measure.
Our methods can be generalized to the class of so-called indicable groups, namely
those groups for which there is a surjective homomorphism to Z. In this setting,
recent work of Hayes [11] provides a systematic way for proving an image measure
is Haar using Fourier coefficients. We use this alternative to the homoclinic group
argument while extending our results to indicable groups and other algebraic actions.
By a result of David Kerr [12], these algebraic actions have completely positive
entropy.
2. Algebraic actions
Let Γ be a countable discrete group with identity element 1Γ . An algebraic Γaction on a compact abelian group X is a homomorphism α : Γ → aut(X) from Γ
to the group of (continuous) algebraic automorphisms of X. We denote the image
of s ∈ Γ under α by αs , so that αst = αs ◦ αt and α1Γ = IdX .
Let
P ZΓ denote the integral group ring of Γ, consisting of all sums of the form
g = s∈Γ gs s, where gs ∈ Z for every s ∈ Γ and only finitely many gs are nonzero.
The (additive) Pontryagin
dual of ZΓ is TΓ , where T = R/Z and the dual pairing
P
is given by hx, gi = s∈Γ xs gs for x ∈ TΓ and g ∈ ZΓ. Left multiplication by Γ
on ZΓ defines a Γ-action that dualizes to the algebraic Γ-action σ on TΓ given by
σ s (x)t = xs−1 t .
Fix an f ∈ ZΓ, and let ZΓf denote the left principal ideal in ZΓ generated by f .
The compact dual group of ZΓ/ZΓf is then a subgroup of TΓ denoted by Xf , and
the restriction of σ to Xf is an algebraic Γ-action denoted by αf . We call (Xf , αf )

the principal algebraic Γ-action defined by f . This action automatically preserves
Haar measure µf on Xf .
A convenient concrete
P description of principal actions uses formal sums. Identify
Γ
x ∈ T with the sum t∈Γ xt t, where xt ∈ T for every t ∈ Γ. Then Γ acts on TΓ by

so that

right by expanding out and collecting terms, with the resultP
denoted by x · g. We
can express the dual pairing by hx, gi = (x · g ∗ )1Γ . Let f ∗ = s∈Γ fs s−1 . Then Xf
is the subgroup
of TΓ consisting of all x for which x · f ∗ = 0. Thus x ∈ Xf if and
P
only if s∈Γ fs xts = 0 for every t ∈ Γ, a finite integral condition on the coordinates
of x.
We will use a similar convention for other spaces as well, for instance ℓ∞ (Γ, R)
and ℓ∞ (Γ, Z).
3. The homoclinic map
Our focus will be on algebraic actions of the free group F of rank two generated
by a and b. We let S = {a, b, a−1 , b−1 } be the standard generating set, and use S
to define the word metric | · |S on F. Our main example is the principal algebraic
F-action defined by f = 3 − a − b ∈ ZF.
First observe that f ∗ = 3 − a−1 − b−1 is invertible in ℓ1 (F, R) by using geometric
series. Specifically, ifPN denotes the set of all words in a−1 and b−1 (including 1F ),
then (f ∗ )−1 = (1/3) s∈N 3−|s| s, which we denote by w∆ .
Note that 0 6 ws∆ 6 1/3 for every s ∈ F. Hence by putting a = b = 1, we see
that
X
ws∆ = kw∆ k1 ,
1 = f ∗ (1, 1)−1 =
s∈F

w∆

and hence P is a probability distribution on F. For every d ∈ ℓ∞ (F, Z) we define
(d · w∆ )s = t∈F dt wt∆−1 s . Clearly |(d · w∆ )s | 6 kdk∞ kw∆ k1 for every s ∈ F. Hence
we can define Φ : ℓ∞ (F, Z) → ℓ∞ (F, R) by Φ(d) = d · w∆ .
Let π : ℓ∞ (F, R) → TF be the projection map defined by reducing each coordinate (mod 1). Clearly π is continuous and equivariant. The composition
φ = π ◦ Φ : ℓ∞ (F, Z) → TF is called the homoclinic map. Since w∆ · f ∗ = 1Γ , if
d ∈ ℓ∞ (F, Z) then

φ(d) · f ∗ = π Φ(d) · f ∗ = π(d · w∆ ) · f ∗ = π(d · w∆ · f ∗ ) = π(d) = 0,

and hence the image of φ is contained in Xf .
A point x ∈ Xf is homoclinic if lim|s|→∞ xs = 0. The subset ∆f of all homoclinic
points is clearly a subgroup of Xf , called the homoclinic group of αf .
Considering 1F ∈ ZF as an element of ℓ∞ (F, Z), we put x∆ = φ(1Γ ) = π(w∆ ).
Since F is residually finite, the results of [6, §4] apply to show that αf is expansive,

4

that ∆f = φ(ZF) consists of all finite integral combinations of shifts of x∆ , and that
∆f is dense in Xf . This density plays a key role in §6.
Let Y = {0, 1, 2}F ⊂ ℓ∞ (F, Z), and let ν denote product measure on Y with each
symbol having measure 1/3. Then the standard shift-action σ of F on Y preserves
ν, and is called the full 3-shift action of F.
Theorem 3.1. Let (Y, σ, ν) be the full 3-shift action of F and (Xf , αf , µf ) be the
principal algebraic F-action defined by f = 3−a−b. The homoclinic map φ : Y → Xf
given by φ(d) = π(d · w∆ ) = d · x∆ is continuous, equivariant, surjective, one-toone off a ν-null set, and φ∗ ν = µf . Thus φ is a measurable isomorphism between
(Xf , αf , µf ) and a Bernoulli shift.
4. Symbolic covers
In this section we find bounded subsets of ℓ∞ (F, Z) that are mapped onto Xf by
the homoclinic map φ, i.e., symbolic covers of (Xf , αf ).

Lemma 4.1. φ {0, 1, 2, 3}F = Xf .
Proof. Let x ∈ Xf . There is a unique v ∈ [0, 1)F with π(v) = x. Since
0Xf = x · f ∗ = π(v) · f ∗ = π(v · f ∗ ),

it follows that v · f ∗ ∈ ℓ∞
−1 6 v · f ∗ 6 2
P(F, Z). Simple inequalities∆ imply that ∆
coordinate-wise. Let 1 = s∈F s, so that Φ(1) = 1·w = 1 since w is a probability
distribution. Then d := v ·f ∗ + 1 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}F , and since f ∗ · w∆ = 1, we have that
φ(d) = π (v · f ∗ + 1) · w∆ = π(v + 1) = π(v) = x.


Let C = [F, F] be the commutator subgroup of F, so that F/C ∼
= Z2 with commuting generators aC and bC. Define a homomorphism F/C → Z by mapping both aC
and bC to 1 ∈ Z. For s ∈ F let [s] denote the image of sC in Z. Then [ · ] : F → Z is
a surjective homomorphism with [sa] = [sb] = [s] + 1 for every s ∈ F. For example,
[a2 b−3 a−1 b] = 2 − 3 − 1 + 1 = −1. Clearly [s] 6 |s|S for all s ∈ F.
We will use [ · ] to improve the previous result to obtain an optimal symbolic cover
of Xf .

Lemma 4.2. φ {0, 1, 2}F = Xf .

Proof. Let x ∈ Xf . By Lemma 4.1, there is a d ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}F with φ(d) = x. Using d
we inductively construct a sequence of points in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}F all of which map to
x under φ, and such that any limit point e of this sequence is contained in {0, 1, 2}F .
Then φ(e) = x by continuity of φ.
Let Bn = {s ∈ F : |s|S 6 n}. Fix n > 1. We inductively construct d(n) , d(n−1) ,
. . ., d(−n−1) in ℓ∞ (F, Z) with the following properties:

(5) φ d(k) = x.

The element d(n) = d trivially satisfies (1)–(5). Suppose we have found d(k)
satisfying (1)–(5) for some k with −n 6 k 6 n. Construct d(k−1) as follows. If
(k−1)
(k)
(k)
[s] 6= k − 1 or k, put ds

(k−1)
(k)
ds
= ds , otherwise put ds
= ds − 3 and add 1 to the coordinates at sa−1
and at sb−1 . Let d(k−1) denote the result after all these operations are carried out.
We claim that d(k−1) satisfies (1)–(5) with k replaced by k − 1. By construction,
(k−1)
(k)
ds
= ds whenever [s] is not k − 1 or k, verifying (3). If s ∈ Bn and [s] = k, then

0 6 ds 6 5 and so ds

(k)
(k−1)

(k)
ds
is either ds , ds + 1, or ds + 2, depending on the coordinates at sa and
(n)
at sb, verifying (2). If s ∈
/ Bn , then 0 6 ds = ds 6 3. When constructing the d(k)
the coordinate at s can change at most once, when k = [s] + 1, and in this case can
increase only by 0, 1, or 2, depending on the coordinates at sa and sa, verifying (4).
Finally, the construction of d(k−1) shows that d(k−1) = d(k) − g · f ∗ for some g ∈ ZF.
Hence

φ d(k−1) = π d(k) · w∆ − g · f ∗ · w∆ = φ d(k) − π(g) = φ d(k) ,

verifying (5) by induction.
By compactness of {0, 1, ..., 5}F , the sequence {d(−n−1) } has a convergent subsequence, say with limit e. Then e ∈ {0, 1, 2}F by (1), and φ(e) = x by (5) and
continuity of φ.

5. Injectivity of the homoclinic map
Here we show that the homoclinic map φ : Y → Xf is one-to-one off a ν-null
subset of Y . The proof uses a modification of the percolation argument in [7, Prop.
5.1].
Proposition 5.1. Let φ : (Y, σ, ν) → (Xf , αf , µf ) be the homoclinic map. Then
there is a σ-invariant subset E ⊂ Y with ν(E) = 0 and such that φ is one-to-one
on Y \ E.
Proof. Let d ∈ Y . Suppose that there is an e ∈ Y such that e 6= d and φ(e) = φ(d).
Then (e − d) · x∆ = 0, so that c := (e − d) · w∆ ∈ ℓ∞ (F, Z). Since −2 6 e − d 6 2 and
w∆ is a probability distribution, it follows that −2 6 c 6 2. Furthermore, c · f ∗ =
(e − d) · w∆ · f ∗ = e − d, and so −2 6 c · f ∗ 6 2. This condition defines a shift of finite
type Σ ⊂ {−2, . . . , 2}F consisting of all c for which −2 6 3cs − csa − csb 6 2 for every
s ∈ F. A direct calculation shows that there are 41 triples (k, l, m) ∈ {−2, . . . , 2}3
with −2 6 3k − l − m 6 2, and these are the allowed patterns for (cs , csa , csb ) that
define Σ.
First suppose that c ∈ Σ has cs = 2 for some s ∈ F. The only allowed pattern of
the form (2, l, m) is (2, 2, 2), showing that csa = 2 and csb = 2 as well. Repeating
this argument shows that (csan , csan+1 , csan b ) = (2, 2, 2) for every n > 0. Hence
(c · f ∗ )san = 2 for every n > 0. Since 0 6 e, d 6 2 and esan − dsan = (c · f ∗ )san = 2,

(s) .
n = 0 for every n > 0. Hence d is contained in a ν-null set E
we conclude that
S dsa (s)
Letting E1 = s∈F E , we see that ν(E1 ) = 0 and that if cs = 2 for some s ∈ F
then d ∈ E1 .
The case cs = −2 for some s ∈ F is similar, resulting in another ν-null set E2 .
Thus we are reduced to the case −1 6 c 6 1 and the corresponding shift of finite
type Σ′ ⊂ {−1, 0, 1}F defined by the same finite-type condition −2 6 3cs −csa −csb 6
2 for every s ∈ F. Another direct calculation shows that there are 15 allowed patterns
in {−1, 0, 1}3 , a subset of the 41 patterns above.
Let c ∈ Σ′ with cs = 1 for some s ∈ F. The only allowed patterns of the form
(1, l, m) are (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), and (1, 1, 1). Fix n > 1. From c we construct a word
p = p1 p2 . . . pn with pj = a or b inductively as follows. Denote p1 p2 . . . pk by sk for
1 6 k 6 n, and define s0 = 1, so that css0 = 1. Suppose that p1 , . . . , pk have been
found so that cssk = 1. If cssk a = 1, then put pk+1 = a, otherwise put pk+1 = b.
This process guarantees that cssk = 1 for every 0 6 k 6 n, but also provides more
information about other coordinates of c which we use to constrain the coordinates
of d.
If pk+1 = b, then (cssk , cssk a , cssk b ) = (1, 0, 1), so that (c · f ∗ )ssk = 2, forcing
dssk = 0 as before.
If pk+1 = a, there are two cases for (cssk , cssk a , cssk b ), either (1, 1, 0) or (1, 1, 1). In
the first case, (c · f ∗ )ssk = 2, and again dssk = 0. In the second case, (c · f ∗ )ssk = 1,
and so (essk , dssk ) is either (1, 0) or (2, 1). But this also means that cssk b = 1, and
so essk b − dssk b = (c · f ∗ )ssk b = 1 or 2, and in either case dssk b = 0 or 1. Hence
(dssk , dssk b ) can be only one of five out of nine possible pairs, namely (0, 0), (0, 1),
(0, 2), (1, 0), or (1, 1). Observe that since [ssj ] = [s] + j and b 6= a, it follows that
ssk b cannot occur among the ssj for 0 6 j 6 n.
Let m be the number of a’s appearing in p = p1 p2 . . . pn . Then d is contained in
a subset of Y of measure (5/9)m (1/3)n−m , one factor of 5/9 for each a in p and one
factor of 1/3 for each b. Thus summing over all possible words p, we see that any d
in this case must lie in a set E (s,n) ⊂ Y with

ν(E ) = 0. Hence E3 := s∈F E is also ν-null. This shows that if e − d = c · f ∗

resulting in a further ν-null set E4 .
S
Thus if d is not in the σ-invariant ν-null set 4j=1 Ej , then there is no e 6= d with
φ(e) = φ(d), concluding the proof.

We remark that although φ is one-to-one ν-almost everywhere, there are subsets
of Y of large cardinality that map to a common point. For example, the equation
φ(d) = 0 leads to an uncountable shift of finite type in {0, 1, 2}F whose image under
the map c 7→ c · f ∗ is the set of solutions.

6. Isomorphism
To show that the homoclinic map φ : (Y, σ, ν) → (Xf , αf , µf ) is a measurable
isomorphism of F-actions, it only remains to show that φ∗ ν = µf . The sofic entropy
of αf with respect to µf equals log 3 by [2, Thm. 1.2]. Furthermore, the sofic
entropy of αf with respect to φ∗ ν is also log 3 by [1, Prop. 2.2] using the homoclinic
isomorphism with the full 3-shift. If we knew that Haar measure were the unique
αf -invariant measure of maximal entropy, we would be done. This is indeed the
case for expansive algebraic actions of amenable groups with completely positive
entropy [4, Thm. 8.6], but remains open for actions of general sofic groups, and
in particular for free groups. Bowen [3, Thm. 8.2] has constructed a cautionary
example of a transitive shift of finite type over F with (at least) two measures of
maximal entropy.
Thus a different proof that φ∗ ν = µf is necessary. Our proof creates enough
group-like structure in Y to show that φ∗ ν is invariant under translation by every
element in the homoclinic group ∆f . Then density of ∆f in Xf implies that φ∗ ν
is a translation-invariant probability measure on Xf , and hence must coincide with
Haar measure µf .
Proposition 6.1. Let δ ∈ Y be the element given by δ1F = 1 and δs = 0 for every
s 6= 1F . Define a map τ : Y → Y by τ (d) = ρ(d + δ), where ρ denotes the reduction
process from the proof of Lemma 4.2. Then τ is well-defined and one-to-one off a
ν-null set, τ∗ ν = ν, and φ(τ (d)) = φ(d) for every d ∈ Y .
Proof. We decompose Y into a countable collection of disjoint cylinder sets whose
union has full measure, and such that τ has the required properties on each cylinder
set. To do this, we introduce a tree structure that reflects coordinates affected by
the reduction process applied to d + δ.
For notational simplicity, let A = a−1 and B = b−1 . Denote the set of all words
in A and B (including 1) by N . If s = s1 ss . . . sn ∈ N , an initial subword of s is
one of the form s1 s2 . . . sk for some 0 6 k 6 n, where by convention this product
is 1 if k = 0. A tree is a finite subset of N that is closed under taking initial
subwords. If T is a tree, we define T = T ∪ T A ∪ T B, where T A = {tA : t ∈ T } and
T B = {tB : t ∈ T }, and ∂T = T r T . For example, if T = {1, A, B, AB, BA, BB},
then T = {1, A, AA, AB, ABA, ABB, B, BA, BAA, BAB, BBA, BBB} and ∂T =
{AA, ABA, ABB, BAA, BAB, BBA, BBB}.
Each tree corresponds to an ordered binary tree, and conversely. From basic
and well-known properties of such trees we know that |T | = 2|T | + 1 and that
|∂T | = |T | + 1.
Let T be a tree and ω ∈ {0, 1}∂T . Define the cylinder set ET, ω ⊂ Y by ET, ω fb
ET, ω = {d ∈ Y : dt = 2 for every t ∈ T and ds = ωs for every s ∈ ∂T }.

By convention, we allow T = ∅ and in this case define T = {1Γ } and ∂T = {1Γ }.
Observe that if d ∈ ET, ω , then the reduction process resulting in ρ(d + δ) will halt

Clearly τ is one-to-one on ET, ω , and ν τ (ET, ω ) = ν(ET, ω ) = (1/3)|T | .

proving that τ is well-defined and one-to-one off a ν-null set, and that τ∗ ν = ν. The
reduction process ρ does not affect the image under φ, and so φ(τ (d)) = φ(ρ(d+δ)) =
φ(d + δ) = φ(d) + x∆ .

Proof of Theorem 3.1. If τ : Y → Y is the map defined in Proposition 6.1, then for
every s ∈ F we have that (σs ◦ τ ◦ σs−1 )(d) = ρ(d + s · δ). Since both σs and τ
preserve ν, and since


φ (σs ◦ τ ◦ σs−1 )(d) = φ ρ(d + s · δ) = φ(d + s · δ) = φ(d) + s · x∆ ,

it follows that for every s ∈ F and every Borel set E ⊂ Xf we have that

(φ∗ ν)(E + s · x∆ ) = ν(φ−1 (E + s · x∆ )) = ν((σs ◦ τ ◦ σs−1 )(φ−1 (E))
= ν(φ−1 E) = (φ∗ ν)(E).

Hence φ∗ ν is invariant under translation by all integral combinations of shifts of x∆ ,
i.e., under translation by all elements in ∆f . Then density of ∆f implies that φ∗ ν
is translation-invariant, and so φ∗ ν = µf .

7. Generalizations
In this section we generalize Theorem 3.1 to a larger class of acting groups and
also to more principal actions.
A countable group Γ is called indicable if there is a surjective homomorphism
[ · ] : Γ → Z. Many of our earlier arguments extend to indicable acting groups. An
exception is the combinatorial proof of Proposition 6.1, from which we deduced
that φ∗ ν = µf . However, we can substitute an analytic alternative due to Hayes
[10, Thm. 3.6] which is both more general and in addition establishes the surjectivity
of the homoclinic map without resorting to the reduction process in Lemma 4.2.

We can also adapt our arguments to elements of the form M − a − b ∈ ZΓ where
M > 3. The main issue here is extending Proposition 5.1 to prove injectivity. One
might expect that the shift of finite type within {−M + 1, . . . , M − 1}Γ analogous
to Σ′ ⊂ {−1, 0, 1}F would be significantly more complicated. However, it turns
out that these coincide for all M > 3, and so the argument can be applied almost
verbatim.
Theorem 7.1. Let Γ be a countable group equipped with a homomorphism [ · ] : Γ →
Z. Suppose that a and b are distinct elements of Γ with [a] = [b] = 1, and that
M > 3 is an integer. Let f = M − a − b ∈ ZΓ. Then the principal algebraic Γ-action
(Xf , αf ) is measurably isomorphic to the Bernoulli Γ-action on {0, 1, . . . , M − 1}Γ
with the uniform base probability measure.
We start by describing some routine extensions needed. As before, put f ∗ =
M − a−1 − b−1 , and let w∆ = (f ∗ )−1 ∈ ℓ1 (Γ, R). Then ws∆ > 0 for every s ∈ Γ, and
kw∆ k1 = 1/(M − 2). Let x∆ = π(w∆ ) ∈ TΓ .
Let Y0 = {0, 1, . . . , M − 1} and ν0 be the uniform probability measure on Y0 . The
P −1 2πikξ
Fourier transform of ν0 is given by νb0 (ξ) = (1/M ) M
. Let Y = Y0Γ and
k=0 e
ν = ν0⊗Γ be product measure on Y . The homoclinic map φ : Y → Xf defined by
φ(d) = d · x∆ = d · π(w∆ ) is continuous.
Since f −1 ∈ ℓ1 (Γ, R), again by geometric series, it follows that g · f −1 ∈ ℓ1 (Γ, R)
for every g ∈ ZΓ. We abbreviate g · f −1 to g/f . We caution the reader that points
of the form π(g/f ) are not in Xf , but rather in Xf ∗ , which can be rather different.
The following is a special case of a result by Hayes [10, Thm. 3.6]. Our case
relatively easy, and for the convenience of the reader we give a direct proof.
Proposition 7.2. With the above notations, let µ = φ∗ ν, considered as a measure
on TΓ . For every g ∈ ZΓ we have that

Since νb0 is smooth with νb0 (0) = 1, and since g/f ∈ ℓ1 (Γ, R), the last product is

The preceding result is valid in great generality, for example for all polynomials
with a summable inverse. However, for our purposes we need more information
about the coordinates of g/f .
Lemma 7.3. Under the hypotheses
of Theorem 7.1, for every g ∈ ZΓ \ ZΓf there

is an s ∈ Γ such that π (g/f )s = k/M for some 1 6 k 6 M − 1.

Proof. If g ∈
/ ZΓf then π(g/f ) 6= 0 in TΓ . Since (1/f )s = 0 for every s ∈ Γ with
[s] < 0, it follows that {[s] : π((g/f ))s 6= 0} is bounded below. Choose s0 that
attains this minimum. Since π(g/f ) · f = π((g/f ) · f ) = π(g) = 0, we obtain that
M π(g/f )s0 − π(g/f )s0 a−1 − π(g/f )s0 b−1 = 0.

But the second and third terms vanish by minimality of [s0 ], showing that π(g/f )s0
has the required form.

Proof of Theorem 7.1. First observe
that νb0 (k/M
 ) = 0 for 1 6 k 6 M − 1, while
Q
νb0 |Z ≡ 1. Furthermore, µ
b(g) = s∈Γ νb0 (g/f )s for every g ∈ ZΓ by Proposition 7.2
and Lemma 7.3. If g ∈ ZΓf , then g/f has integral coordinates and hence µ
b(g) = 1. If
g ∈ ZΓ\ZΓf , then there is an s for which π((g/f )s ) = k/M for some 1 6 k 6 M −1.
Then νb0 ((g/f )s ) = 0 and so µ
b(g) = 0. Hence µ
b and µ
bf both equal the indicator
function of ZΓf , and so µ = µf .
Since φ is continuous and φ∗ ν = µf has full support, it follows that φ is surjective.
Finally, consider the proof for injectivity in Proposition 5.1. Suppose that e, d ∈ Y
with φ(e) = φ(d). Then e · w∆ − d · w∆ = c ∈ ℓ∞ (Γ, Z). But
M −1

ke · w∆ − d · w∆ k∞ 6 ke − dk∞ kw∆ k1 6
M −2
If M > 4, then (M − 1)/(M − 2) < 2, and so −1 6 c 6 1. Furthermore, the allowed
blocks in defining the shift of finite type Σ over F are exactly those in the proof that
remain after the possibility that cs = 2 or cs = −2 have been dealt with. Explicitly,
{(k, l, m) ∈ {−1, 0, 1}3 : −M + 1 6 3k − l − m 6 M − 1} is the same set of 15
patterns. The proof now proceeds as before, with the bound of (8/9)n replaced by
[(2M + 2)/M 2 ]n .

8. Remarks and questions
Suppose that Γ is a countable group
P and that [ · ] : Γ → Z is a homomorphism.
Let f ∈ ZΓ have the form f = MP− s∈I fs s, where both [s] > 1 and fs > 0 hold
for every s ∈ I, and where M > s∈I fs . Using the same notation as in §7, we see
that w∆ = (f ∗ )−1 ∈ ℓ1 (Γ, R) defines the continuous homoclinic map φ : Y → Xf .
Proposition 7.2 and Lemma 7.3 easily extend to show that φ is surjective and maps
the Bernoulli measure νb0⊗Γ to Haar measure µf . What is not obvious is whether φ
is essentially one-to-one, although this seems to us likely.
Conjecture 8.1. Let ΓP
be a countable group and
P [ · ] : Γ → Z be a homomorphism.
Suppose that f = M − s∈I fs s, where M > s∈I fs and [s] > 1 and fs > 0 for
every s ∈ I. Then the homoclinic map φ : Y → Xf is a measurable isomorphism.
The condition that the large coefficient of f occur at an extreme coordinate
with respect to [ · ] is certainly necessary. Take√for example Γ = Z = hai and
f = 3 − a − a−1 . Then αf has entropy log[(3 + 5)/2] < log 3. Here Lemma 7.3
breaks down, since the coordinates of 1/f are irrational. Indeed, it is even possible
for these coordinates to be transcendental [17, Example 5.8]. Einsiedler and the
second author constructed an explicit sofic shift and a continuous map from it to Xf
that is essentially one-to-one [7, Example 4.1]. The extent to which algebraic actions
have such “good” symbolic covers has been extensively studied for Γ = Zd , and now
presents new possibilities for general Γ.
As observed in [7, Cor. 5.1] in the case Γ = Z2 , by varying [ · ] we can conclude
that each of the four elements 3 − a±1 − b±1 give an algebraic Γ-action isomorphic
to the same Bernoulli Γ-action, and hence are isomorphic to each other. However,
changing the coefficient signs can seriously impede our analysis. For instance, using
the notation in Conjecture 8.1, does f = 3 + a + b define an algebraic Γ-action that
is Bernoulli?
P
An element f ∈ ZΓ is lopsided if there is an s0 ∈ Γ such that |fs0 | > s6=s0 |fs |.
For an arbitrary countable group Γ, is every principal algebraic Γ-action defined by
a lopsided polynomial measurably isomorphic to a Bernoulli Γ-action? Hayes [11]
showed that every such action is a factor of a Bernoulli action under some mild
orderability assumptions on Γ. It follows that if Γ is amenable, then the action itself
is Bernoulli by the results of Ornstein and Weiss [20]. However, to our knowledge
this remains open for nonamenable groups, and even for free groups.
Next, consider the case Γ = F and f = 2 − a − b. If we attempt to mimic earlier
constructions, we immediately hit a roadblock that although 1/f ∗ is well-defined, it
is no longer in ℓ1 (F, R), and so the convolution operator used to define the homoclinic
map has no clear meaning. However, here 1/f ∗ ∈ ℓ2 (F, R), and recent work of Hayes
[10] shows that convolution can be extended to square summable elements, using
convergence in measure. As a consequence, he obtains a well-defined measurable
homoclinic map φ : {0, 1}F → Xf , and his more general version of Proposition 7.2
shows that φ maps the Bernoulli measure to Haar measure. However, this leaves
open the enticing problem of whether this explicit map is essentially one-to-one.

Finally, let Γ = F and f = 1+a+b. Historically, it was the careful computation of
the entropy of the commutative version of this example that was the key to unlocking the connection between entropy for algebraic actions and Mahler measure [16].
There are tantalizing clues √that the sofic entropy of αf is not only positive, but
has the precise value log(3/ 2). Essentially nothing is known about the dynamical
properties of αf . Is it mixing? Does it have completely positive entropy (with respect to every sofic approximation to F)? Is it measurably isomorphic to a Bernoulli
F-action?
