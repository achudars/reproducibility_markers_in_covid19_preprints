We report the nonlocal spin Seebeck effect (nlSSE) in a lateral configuration of Pt/Y3 Fe5 O12 (YIG)/Pt systems as a
function of the magnetic field B (up to 10 T) at various temperatures T (3 K < T < 300 K). The nlSSE voltage
decreases with increasing B in a linear regime with respect to the input power (the applied charge-current squared I 2 ).
The reduction of the nlSSE becomes substantial when the Zeeman energy exceeds thermal energy at low temperatures,
which can be interpreted as freeze-out of magnons relevant for the nlSSE. Furthermore, we found the non-linear power
dependence of the nlSSE with increasing I at low temperatures (T < 20 K), at which the B-induced signal reduction
becomes less visible. Our experimental results suggest that in the non-linear regime high-energy magnons are over
populated than those expected from the thermal energy. We also estimate the magnon spin diffusion length as functions
of B and T .
Spin caloritronics1 is an emerging field to study the interconversion between spin and heat currents. The spin Seebeck
effect (SSE) is one of the fundamental phenomena in this field,
referring to the spin-current generation from a heat current.
The SSE is well studied in a longitudinal configuration2,3 ,
which consists of a heavy metal(HM)/ferromagnet(FM) bilayer system, typically Pt/Y3 Fe5 O12 (YIG) junction. When a
thermal gradient is applied perpendicular to the interface, a
magnon spin current is generated in FM and converted into
a conduction-electron spin current in HM via the interfacial
exchange interaction4, which is subsequently detected as a
transverse electric voltage via the inverse spin Hall effect
(ISHE)5,6 . Recent studies of the longitudinal SSE (LSSE)7–9
suggest that magnon transport in FM plays a key role in SSEs.
Nonlocal experiment is a powerful tool to investigate the
transport of spin currents in various magnetic insulators10–20 .
Especially, when a spin current is excited via a thermal gradient, it is called the nonlocal SSE (nlSSE)10,11 . A typical nonlocal device consists of two HM wires on top of a magnetic
insulator, which are electrically separated with the distance
d. In nlSSE measurements, one of the HM wires is used as a
heater; the Joule heating of an applied charge current (I) drives
magnon spin currents in the magnetic insulator. Some of the
magnons reach the other HM wire and inject a spin current,
which is converted into a voltage via the ISHE. By changing
the injector-detector separation distance d, we can address the
transport property of magnon spin currents.
In this paper, we report the high magnetic field (B) dependence of the nlSSE in lateral Pt/YIG/Pt systems at various
temperatures from T = 300 K to 3 K and up to |B| = 10 T. We
observed that the nlSSE signal V2ω decreases with increasing
B, but the feature turns out to depend on the amplitude of the
applied I. In a linear regime (V2ω ∝ I 2 ), substantial B-induced

suppression of the nlSSE was observed below 10 K, which is
consistent with the previous LSSE results in Pt/YIG8,21 . In a
non-linear regime (V2ω 6∝ I 2 ), however, the nlSSE signal remains almost unchanged under high B at low T s. By measuring the d dependence, we estimate the magnon diffusion
length λ as functions of T and B.
We prepared series of nonlocal Pt/YIG/Pt devices, schematically shown in Fig. 1(a). A 2.5-µ m-thick YIG film
was grown by liquid phase epitaxy on a Gd3 Ga5 O12 (111)
substrate22 . On top of the YIG film, we fabricated two Pt
wires using e-beam lithography and the lift-off process19. The
dimension of the Pt wires is 200 µ m length, 100 nm width,
and 10 nm thickness. The Pt wires were deposited by magnetron sputtering in Ar+ atmosphere. We investigated four
batches of samples (S1-S4) cut from the same YIG wafer.
The d dependence was studied in S1 (d = 5, 6, 8, 13, 15,
and 20 µ m) and S2 (d = 9 µ m), while the I dependence at
low T s in S3 (d = 2 µ m) and S4 (d = 8 µ m). We measured a
nonlocal voltage using a lock-in detection technique; we applied an a.c. charge current, I, of 13.423 Hz in frequency to
the injector Pt wire and measured a second harmonic nonlocal
voltage V2ω across the detector Pt wire11 .
First, we confirmed that the obtained nonlocal voltage satisfies the features of the nlSSE at room temperature. Figure
1(b) shows typical V2ω as a function of in-plane B (θ = 90◦)
at 300 K in the d = 9 µ m sample. A clear V2ω appears,
whose sign changes with respect to the B direction. V2ω disappears when B is applied perpendicular to the plane (θ = 0).
This symmetry is consistent with that of the SSE3 . We define the low-field amplitude of the voltage signal as VnlSSE =
[V2ω (0.18 T) − V2ω (−0.18 T)]/2, at which the magnetization
of YIG is fully saturated along B. As shown in Fig. 1(c),
VnlSSE is proportional to I 2 , indicating that VnlSSE appears due
to the Joule heating. With increasing B, V2ω gradually decreases, and at around ±2.2 T, sharp dip structures show up,
which are induced by magnon polarons due to magnon−TA-

By changing the injector-detector separation distance d, we
estimate the length scale of the magnon spin current25. As
shown in Fig. 1(d), VnlSSE decreases with increasing d. A
one-dimensional spin diffusion model11,26 describes the decay, which reads

where λ is the magnon spin diffusion length and C is the dindependent constant. We fit Eq. (1) to the d dependence of
VnlSSE and obtain λ = 6.76 ± 0.16 µ m at 300 K. Similar values
are reported in previous studies in both thin (200 nm)11 , and
thick (50 µ m)27 YIG films.
Next, we measured the T dependence of V2ω with I =
100 µ A. As shown in Fig. 2(a), at 300 K negative voltages
are observed for the d = 0.5 and 1.5 µ m samples, while the
positive ones show up for the d = 8 and 15 µ m samples. With
decreasing T , the d = 8 and 15 µ m samples exhibit a monotonic increase of VnlSSE . On the other hand, with decreasing T
the negative voltages observed for the d = 0.5 and 1.5 µ m
samples at 300 K change their sign at several tens Kelvin.
The sign change of VnlSSE with changing d and T has been
observed in previous nlSSE experiments and explained as a
result of a spatial profile of the magnon chemical potential
µm that governs the sign and amplitude of VnlSSE ; a negative

fitting to the d dependence of VnlSSE . (c) V2ω (B) in the d = 1.5 µ m
sample with I = 100 µ A at 300 K. (d) δ (T ) for different d. δ is
defined by Eq. (2).

µm created beneath the Pt injector exponentially decays apart
from the injector and above a certain distance a positive one
manifests due to the presence of YIG/GGG interface. The
overall µm profile varies with T 14–16,25–27 . Furthermore, we
found a second sign change for the d = 0.5 µ m sample at 3 K,
which is unclear at this moment.
We now focus on the magnetic field B dependent features of
V2ω . Figure 2(b) shows the B dependence of λ at various T s
obtained by fitting Eq. (1) to VnlSSE (d). At 300 K, λ decreases
with increasing B by 30 % up to 3 T [from λ = 6.8 µ m at
B = 0.18 T to 4 µ m at 3 T, see blue filled circles in Fig. 2(b)].
A similar field-induced decrease of λ has been observed in
the time-resolved LSSE28 , nlSSE29 , and electrically excited
magnon transport experiment29 at room temperature. On the
other hand, at lower T s, λ was found to be less sensitive to B
[see Fig. 2(b)].
To further investigate the effect of high B on the nlSSE, we
applied larger magnetic fields up to 10 T. Figure 2(c) shows a
typical V2ω − B result for |B| < 10 T in the d = 1.5 µ m sample
with I = 100 µ A at 300 K. High B-induced suppression of
V2ω is clearly observed. In Fig. 2(d) we plot the degree of
B-induced V2ω suppression up to 8 T, defined as

as a function of T for the d = 0.5, 1.5, 8.0, and 15 µ m samples. At 300 K, all the samples show the substantial high Binduced V2ω reduction; 65 % < δ < 75 % for the d = 1.5, 8.0,
and 15 µ m samples and δ = 39 % for the d = 0.5 µ m sample. For the d = 8.0 and 15 µ m samples, with decreasing T ,
δ gradually decreases in the range of 20 K < T < 300 K and
slightly increases below 20 K. For the d = 0.5 and 1.5 µ m
samples, more complicated T dependences were observed,
which may be related to the non-monotonic T responses of

V2ω as shown in Fig. 2(a). The T − δ behavior above 20 K for
the d = 8.0 and 15 µ m samples qualitatively agrees with the
previous LSSE result in Pt/YIG-bulk systems8,30 . However,
below 20 K, the present nlSSE and previous LSSE results are
totally different; δ of the LSSE becomes more outstanding
with decreasing T and reaches δ ∼ 100% at ∼ 3 K21 , much
greater than the present nlSSE results.
Significantly, we found that the disagreement at low temperatures is relevant to the applied current intensity I. So far,
the nlSSE experiments were carried out with I = 100 µ A. Below 20 K, however, V2ω turned out to deviate from the I 2 scaling in this I range. To see this, we introduce the normalization
factor,
S=

V2ω
.

If V2ω is proportional to I 2 , S keeps a constant with I, which
was indeed confirmed above 20 K for I < 100 µ A. Figure 3(a)
shows the I dependence of S at 3 K at the low B of 0.18 T for
the d = 2, 8, and 9 µ m samples. S takes almost the same
value for I . 5 µ A [see the gray colored area in Fig. 3(a)],
but for I & 5 µ A, S decreases with increasing I. We refer the
former region to the linear regime (V2ω ∝ I 2 ), while the latter to the non-linear regime (V2ω 6∝ I 2 ). In Fig. 3(b), we plot
the T dependence of S in the linear and non-linear regimes at
B = 0.5 T for the d = 8 µ m sample. The difference in S between the linear and non-linear regimes becomes significant
with decreasing T , and at 3 K S in the linear regime is about 4
times greater than that in the non-linear regime. Importantly,
the B dependence of V2ω and δ also vary between the linear
and non-linear regimes. In Fig. 3(c), we show representative
results on V2ω versus B with several I values at 3 K for the
d = 2.0 µ m sample. In the linear regime (for I = 3 µ A), clear
B-induced V2ω suppression was observed (δ = 78 %). By increasing I and entering into the non-linear regime, however,
the B-induced V2ω reduction becomes less visible and, when
I = 100 µ A, V2ω is almost flat against B (δ = −0.1 %). In Fig.
3(d), we summarize the δ values as a function of T obtained
in the linear (red filled circles) and non-linear (blue filled circles) regimes for the d = 8.0 µ m sample and compare them
to the previous LSSE result (gray filled triangles)21. Interestingly, the T dependence of δ for the nlSSE agrees well with

that for the LSSE.
The matching of the T − δ results in the low-T range between the nlSSE in the linear regime and the LSSE indicates
that the same mechanism governs the B-induced suppression.
In Ref. 8 and 21, the T dependence of δ for the LSSE at
low T s was well reproduced based on a conventional LSSE
theory in which the effect of the Zeeman-gap opening in a
magnon dispersion (∝ gµB B, where g is the g-factor and µB is
the Bohr magneton) was taken into account; the competition
between thermal occupation of the magnon mode relevant for
the LSSE (whose energy is of the order of kB T ) and the Zeeman gap (g µB B) dominates the B-induced LSSE reduction.
When kB T ≪ gµB B (≈ 10 K at 8 T), magnons cannot be thermally excited, leading to the suppression of the LSSE (see
Fig. 3(d)). Our results indicate that the same scenario is valid
also for the nlSSE in the linear regime.
Finally, we discuss the non-linear feature of the nlSSE.
Both the S and δ values of the nlSSE in the non-linear regime
gradually increase with decreasing T [see Figs. 3(b) and 3(d)].
However, their increasing rates are much smaller than those
for the linear regime; both S and δ at 3 K in the non-linear
regime are ∼ 4 times smaller than those at the same T for
the linear regime and also comparable to those at 12 K for
the linear regime. These results suggest that the energy scale
of magnons driving the nlSSE in the non-linear regime at 3
K may be much higher than the thermal energy kB T at 3 K
and the Zeeman energy gµB B at 8 T. We note that, in the
non-linear regime, the system temperature at least remains unchanged during the measurements, indicting that temperature
rise due to the Joule heating is negligible. Furthermore, we
found that, in the non-linear regime of I = 100 µ A, the intensity of magnon-polaron dips at 3 K at B = 2.5 T (9.2 T) is
smaller (larger) than that in the linear regime of I = 3 µ A at
the same T [see the dip structures marked by blue (red) triangles in Fig. 3(c)]. Here, the dip at the low B (high B) originates
from the spin currents carried by hybridized magnon−TAphonon (magnon−LA-phonon) modes with the fixed energy
of EMTA ≈ 6 K (EMLA ≈ 26 K). The dip intensity should
thereby be maximized when the magnon mode at the energy
of EMTA (EMLA ) is most significantly occupied under the condition of kB T ≈ 6 K (26 K), and apart from this temperature
the intensity of magnon-polaron dip decreases. Therefore,

4
the small (large) magnon-polaron dip at B = 2.5 T (9.2 T)
at 3 K in the non-linear regime also indicates the over occupation of high-energy magnons than that expected from the
thermal energy kB T at 3 K, as with the S and δ results discussed above. Future work should address the origin of such
high-nonequilibrium state realized in this regime.
In summary, we systematically investigated the nonlocal
spin Seebeck effect (nlSSE) in the lateral Pt/YIG/Pt systems
as functions of separation distance (d), magnetic field (B),
temperature (T ), and excitation current (I). We found that
below 20 K, the nlSSE voltage V2ω deviates from the conventional I 2 scaling for I & 5 µ A. In this non-linear regime, the
amplitudes of V2ω and B-induced signal reduction δ become
smaller than those in the linear regime, where V2ω ∝ I 2 and
I < 5 µ A. In the linear regime, the T dependence of δ of the
nlSSE agrees well with that of the longitudinal SSE (LSSE),
which can be attributed to the suppression of magnon excitation by the Zeeman effect. Our results provide an important
clue in unraveling the B-induced suppression of the nlSSE and
useful information on the non-linear effect in nonlocal spin
transport at low temperatures.
