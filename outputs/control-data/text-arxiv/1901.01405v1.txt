Abstract:
The object of this work is to study the magnetic properties of the Lieb structure based on
magnetic particles with «core-shell» nano-structure. This system is consisting of a
ferromagnetic 2D Ising model formed with spins: σ = 1/2, S = 1 and q = 3/2. Firstly, we
examine the magnetic properties of this nanostructure. On the other hand, we study the effect
of the coupling exchange interactions and the crystal field. We use the Monte Carlo
simulations to investigate also the behavior of the Lieb nano-structure. Finally, we study the
influence of the temperature on the critical and compensation behaviors of the studied system.
The obtained results are summarized in the phase diagrams.

1- Introduction :
Nowadays, the various nano-structures have become important elements of the science and
industrial research. Geometry, whether on the atomic or nano-scale, is a key factor for the
electronic band structure of materials. Some specific geometry gives rise to novel and
potentially useful electronic bands. For example, a honeycomb lattice leads to Dirac type
bands where the charge carriers behave as mass-less particles [1]. A significant advantage of
the scientific research is the full control of a wide range of system parameters as, for example,
lattice geometry, interaction, and disorder. The design of the molecular Lieb lattice is not
trivial for several reasons. When, the Lieb lattice has four-fold rotational symmetry.
Theoretical predictions are triggering the exploration of novel two-dimensional (2D)
geometries [2-10], such as graphynes and the kagomé and Lieb lattices. The Lieb lattice is the
2D analogue of the 3D lattice exhibited by perovskites [2]; it is a square-depleted lattice,
which is characterized by a band structure featuring Dirac cones intersected by a flat band.
Whereas photonic and cold-atom Lieb lattices have been demonstrated [11-17], an electronic
equivalent in 2D is difficult to realize in an existing material. On the other hand, the heat
capacity of the magnetic susceptibility reduces with increasing the magnetic field strength in
the high temperature region of the spin Lieb nano-lattice [18].
Since a 2D electronic Lieb lattice has not been realized, lithography could be used to impose a
Lieb pattern on a 2D electron gas [7, 19]. Alternatively, a similar strategy is envisaged to the
one employed for generating artificial grapheme and could be used for the assembling a
molecular lattice on a substrate featuring a surface state to force the electrons into the desired
geometry [20].
The aim of this paper is to examine the magnetic properties of the Lieb magnetic composites
based on magnetic particles with «core-shell» nano-structure consisting of a ferromagnetic
in 2D Ising model. We study the effect of the coupling exchange interactions and the crystal
field. Indeed, we analyze the influence of the temperature on the critical and compensation
behaviors of the studied system by using the Monte Carlo method [21-24].
The outline of this paper is as follows: We describe the model and the formulations used and
method in section 2. Section 3 is dedicated to results and discussions. A conclusion is in given
in section 4.

2- Model and method:
In this section, we study the magnetic properties of a Lieb nano-structure compound based on
magnetic spins: σ = 1/2, S = 1 and q = 3/2. Such structure consists of a ferromagnetic 2D
Ising model. We examine the influence of the critical and compensation temperature
behaviors under a uniform magnetic field. We examine also the effect of the crystal field and
the coupling exchange interactions. The corresponding geometry of the studied system is
given in Fig. 1.
The Hamiltonian controlling the studied Lieb nano-structure is given by:

will limit our study to the special case: D = D = D .

The crystal field D is applied on the S-spins and q-spins. Where: D = D = D .

The number of spins of the studied system is: N = 5, N = 4 and N = 12. The total
number spins is N = N + N + N = 21, see Fig. 1.
We apply the Monte Carlo under the Metropolis algorithm [25-29] to inspect the magnetic
behavior of the studied Lieb magnetic «core-shell» nano-structure. The system is formed with
the spins (1/2, 1, 3/2). During the calculations we generate a random initial configuration.
This method has been performed to investigate the equilibrium nanosystem [30]. We perform
10 MC steps per spin by visiting the sites of the system.

The steps per spin MCS reaches the equilibrium system for 10 Monte Carlo steps, for a fixed
temperature. We eliminate the first 10 configurations for each initial condition. The error
bars were calculated with a Jackknife method [31].

3- Results and discussion:
3-1- Ground state phase diagrams:

Starting from the Hamiltonian (1) describing the studied system, we inspect the possible
stable configurations in different phase planes of the physical system. By computing and
comparing the all possible configurations 2 × 3 × 5 = 30, we provide the corresponding
phase diagrams in different planes. Indeed, we combine the different configurations of the
spins σ = 1/2, S = 1 and q = 3/2. The corresponding ground state phase diagrams are
presented in Figs. 2(a)-(k).
In the plane (H, D), we illustrate in Fig. 2a, the stable phases for the exchange coupling
interactions values∶ J

=J

=J

=J

=J

= 1. We found that six stable configurations

are present in this figure, for the negative values of the crystal field D. While, only two
configurations are found to be stable for the positive values of this parameter, see the Fig. 2a.
To inspect the stable configurations, we illustrate in Fig. 2b, corresponding to the plane
(H, J ), the stable phases, for the exchange coupling interactions values∶ J
J

=J

=J

=

= 1. From this figure, a perfect symmetry is found, regarding the external magnetic

field H for (D = 0), see the Fig. 2b. We found that four stable configurations are present, for
the negative values of the coupling exchange interaction J . Only two configurations are
found to be stable for the positive values of this parameter.
A perfect symmetry is found, in Fig. 2c, regarding the external magnetic field H in the plane
(H, J ) for the exchange coupling interactions fixed to the values: J

=J

=J

=J

= 1.

In the absence of the crystal field (D = 0), we found that four stable configurations,
corresponding to negative values of the coupling exchange interaction J . In fact, only two
configurations are found to be stable for the positive values of this parameter.
In the plane (D, J ), corresponding to Fig. 2d, we provide the stable configurations for fixed
values of the exchange coupling interactions constant : J

=J

=J

=J

= 1. From this

figure, we found that four configurations are stable for negative values of both the crystal
field D and the coupling exchange interaction J . Nevertheless, only two configurations are
stable for the positive values of the crystal field D. In addition, three configurations are found
to be stable for the positive values of the coupling exchange interaction J

in the absence of

the external magnetic field (H = 0), see the Fig. 2d.
In the absence of the external magnetic field (H = 0) in the plane (D, J ), we found Fig. 2e
that five configurations stable for negative values of both the crystal field D and the coupling

exchange interaction J . The other exchange coupling interactions are kept constant, in this
figure: J

=J

=J

=J

= 1. Indeed, only two configurations are found to be stable for

the positive values of the crystal field D and three configurations are found to be stable for the
positive values of the coupling exchange interaction J . This is due to the competition
between the crystal field and the exchange coupling interactions effect.
To inspect the stable configurations, in the plane (D, J ) we provide the obtained results in
the Fig. 2f, for fixed values of the coupling exchange interactions constant: J
J

=J

=J

=

= 1. We found that five configurations are stable, for the negative values of both the

crystal field D and the coupling exchange interaction J . From this figure, two configurations
are found to be stable for the positive values of the crystal field D and three configurations are
found to be stable for the positive values of the coupling exchange interaction J

in the

absence of the external magnetic field (H = 0).
In Fig. 2g, we present the five stable configurations in the plane (J , J ), in the absence of
the external magnetic and the crystal fields (H = D = 0), for the negative values of the
coupling exchange interactions J
interactions∶ J

=J

and J

and fixed values of the exchange coupling

stable for the positive values of the coupling exchange interactions J

and J , see Fig. 2g.

We found that three configurations are stable for the negative values of the coupling exchange
interactions J
interactions: J

and J , in the plane (J , J ) for fixed values of the coupling exchange

=J

= 1, in the absence of both the external magnetic and the crystal

fields (H = D = 0). Two configurations are found to be stable for the positive values of the
coupling exchange interactions J

and J , see the Fig. 2h.

In the absence of the external magnetic and the crystal fields (H = D = 0), we found that four
stable configurations are present in the plane (J , J ), for the negative values of the coupling
exchange interactions J
J

=J

=J

and J

for the fixed values of the coupling exchange interactions∶

= 1 . Moreover, only two configurations are found to be stable for the

positive values of the coupling exchange interactions J

and J , see the Fig. 2i.

In the plane (J , J ) we found that four stable configurations are present for the negative
values of the coupling exchange interactions J

and J

in the absence of both the external

magnetic and the crystal fields (H = D = 0). While, only two configurations are found to be
stable for the positive values of the coupling exchange interactions J

and J , see the Fig. 2j.

In the absence of both the external magnetic and the crystal fields (H = D = 0) in the plane
(J , J ), we found that only four configurations are stable for the negative values of the

3-2- Monte Carlo study:
In this part, we use the Monte Carlo simulations to study the magnetizations and the
susceptibilities as a function of both of the external magnetic and the crystal fields. We will
also examine the effect of the coupling exchange interactions for fixed values of the
temperature. The corresponding phase diagrams are plotted in Figs. 3(a)-(d) for a fixed
temperature value: T = 0.5 K.
The Fig. 3a presents the behavior of the magnetizations as a function of the external magnetic
field in the absence of the crystal field (D = 0) and fixed values of the coupling exchange
interactions: J

=J

=J

= 1 and J

=J

= −0.1. The magnetization m is of second

order transition type; while the magnetizations m , m and m are of first order transition
type. Indeed, in the corresponding hysteresis cycles we found a double loop for the total
magnetization m . This behavior can be explained by the anti-ferromagnetism introduced by
the negative values of the coupling exchange interactions (J

=J

= −0.1).

In order to investigate the behavior of the susceptibilities as a function of the external
magnetic field in the absence of the crystal field (D = 0) we plot in Fig. 3b the obtained
results. This figure is plotted for fixed values of the coupling exchange interactions: J
J

=J

= 1 and J

=J

=

= −0.1. In fact, the susceptibilities χ , χ and χ present a peak

surrounding the critical temperature value.
Following the same motivation, we illustrate in Fig. 3c the behavior of the magnetizations as a
function of the crystal field for (H = 0) and fixed values of the coupling exchange
interactions: J

=J

=J

= 1 and J

=J

= −0.1. The magnetization m is found to be

of second order transition type. While the magnetizations m , m and m are of first order

transition type. These behaviors are started from the negative values to the positive ones. In
fact, we found a double transition for the total magnetization m . This behavior is due to the
anti-ferromagnetic behavior introduced by negative values of the coupling exchange
interactions (J

=J

= −0.1).

In Fig. 3d, we present the susceptibilities as a function of the crystal field in the absence of the
external magnetic field (H = 0) and fixed values of the coupling exchange interactions:
J

=J

=J

= 1 and J

=J

= −0.1. Indeed, only one peak is found for the

susceptibilities χ and χ . This peak corresponds exactly to the critical temperature of the
system.
In order to show the effect of the behavior of the magnetizations as a function of the
temperature, we plot in Figs. 4a and 4b the thermal magnetizations and susceptibilities
profiles, respectively. This figure is plotted for the external magnetic field (H = 0), fixed
values of the coupling exchange interactions J

=J

=J

= 1, J

=J

= −0.1 and D =

−1. Indeed, we found three compensation temperature points for T < 2.5. While, the all
magnetizations stabilize for T > 3,

Fig. 4a. In Fig. 4b, we provide the corresponding

susceptibilities as a function of the temperature for (H = 0), fixed values of the coupling
exchange interactions J

=J

=J

= 1, J

=J

= −0.1 and the crystal field value D =

−1. All these susceptibilities show a peak, not only for the critical temperature Tc, but also at
the temperature value corresponding to the compensation value, see Fig. 4b.
4- Conclusion:
In this work, we have studied the magnetic properties and phase diagrams of a Lieb nanostructure based on magnetic particles with «core-shell» consisting of ferromagnetic spins. We
have examined the effect of the coupling exchange interactions and the crystal field. We also
envisaged the stable configurations in different planes and found a perfect symmetry
regarding the external magnetic field H . Some new phases are arising with large regions in
the absence of the external magnetic field (H = 0). We applied the Monte Carlo simulations
to study the behavior of this Lieb nano-structure for non null temperature values. On the other
hand, we presented and discussed the hysteresis loops. We have also analyzed the effect of
different physical parameters on the behavior of the partial and total magnetizations,
susceptibilities, the compensation and critical temperatures. For specific values of the physical
parameters, three compensation points are found for this Lieb nano-structure system.
