Abstract Representation formulas for faces and support functions of the values of maximal monotone
operators are established in two cases: either the operators are defined on uniformly Banach spaces with
uniformly convex duals, or their domains have nonempty interiors on reflexive real Banach spaces. Faces
and support functions are characterized by the limit values of the minimal-norm selections of maximal
monotone operators in the first case while in the second case they are represented by the limit values of any
selection of maximal monotone operators. These obtained formulas are applied to study the structure of
maximal monotone operators: the local unique determination from their minimal-norm selections, the local
and global decompositions, and the unique determination on dense subsets of their domains.

1 Introduction
Faces and support functions are important tools in representation and analysis of closed convex sets (see [11,
Chapter V]). For a closed convex set, a face is the set of points on the given set which maximizes some
(nonzero) linear form while the support function is the signed distance from the origin point to the supporting
planes of that set. The face associated with a given direction can be defined via the value of the support

function at this direction [10, Definition 3.1.3, p. 220]. Recently, this notion has been defined and studied
for the values of maximal monotone operators in [10, Sect. 3]. In this paper, the authors provided some
characterizations for the boundary and faces of the values of maximal monotones operators in Hilbert spaces.
Their work is motivated by the applications of these characterizations to the stability issues of semi-infinite
linear programming problems.
Motivated by the study of the structure of maximal monotone operators, our paper will investigate
the faces and support functions for the values of maximal monotone operators in reflexive real Banach
spaces. We aim to establish some representation formulas for the faces and support functions in two cases
regarding the uniform convexity of the given spaces and theirs duals, and the nonemptiness of the domains of
maximal monotone operators. For the first case, we will extend the characterizations of faces associated with
directions in [10, Theorem 3.2] from Hilbert spaces to uniformly convex ones with uniformly convex duals. In
comparison with previous work, where the authors used the properties of solutions of differential inclusions
governed by maximal monotone operators, the proof here is new, simpler and more directed since we only
use some basic properties of the Yosida approximation of maximal monotone operators. We formulate in
the context of uniformly convex spaces since our proof strongly depends on the single-valuedness the duality
mapping and its inverse, and the strong convergence of the trajectories generated by Yosida approximation.
The obtained characterizations and the graphical density of points of subdifferentiability of convex functions
allow us to get the representation formulas for support functions in uniformly convex spaces with uniformly
convex duals. For the second case, we will work with maximal monotone operators whose domains have
nonempty interiors in reflexive Banach spaces. Under the assumption that the domains of operators have
nonempty interiors and the local boundedness of maximal monotone operators we could refine the formulas
obtained in the first case. We show that the faces and support functions can be represented by the limit
values of any selection of maximal monotone operators.
Characterizations for faces and support functions allow us to investigate the structure of maximal monotone operators. On uniformly convex spaces with uniformly convex duals, we show the local unique determination of maximal monotone operators from their minimal-norm selections, and their local decompositions
when their minimal-norm selections are locally bounded. On reflexive Banach spaces, we get some global
decompositions of maximal monotone operators when their domains have nonempty interiors. The global
decompositions allow us to prove the unique determination of maximal monotone operators on dense subset
of their domains.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we recall some basic notations of geometry
of reflexive real Banach spaces and monotone operator theory. We also collect preliminary results in this
section for the reader’s convenience. In Sect. 3, representation formulas for faces and support functions are
established in uniformly convex spaces with uniformly convex duals. Theses formulas help us to show the
local unique determination and to get the local decomposition of a maximal monotone operator provided that

its minimal-norm selection is locally bounded. In Sect. 4, we will work with maximal monotone operators
whose domains have nonempty interiors in reflexive real Banach spaces. Under our assumptions, we could
refine the formulas for faces and support functions obtained in Sect. 3. The refined formulas allow us to
find some global decompositions of maximal monotone operators and to show their unique determination
on dense subsets of their domains.

2 Basic Definitions and Preliminaries
Let X be a real reflexive Banach space with norm k · k and X ∗ its continuous dual. The value of a functional
x∗ ∈ X ∗ at x ∈ X is denoted by hx∗ , xi. The open unit balls on X and X ∗ are denoted, respectively, by
B and B∗ . For x ∈ X and r > 0, the open ball centered at x with radius r is denoted by B(x; r). We use
the symbol lim or → to indicate the strong convergence in X, and ⇀ for weak convergence in X and X ∗ .
Denote on X the set-valued mapping J : X ⇒ X ∗
J (x) := {x∗ ∈ X ∗ : hx∗ , xi = kxk2 = kx∗ k2 },

∀x ∈ X.

The mapping J is called the duality mapping of the space X. The inverse mapping J −1 : X ∗ ⇒ X defined
by J −1 (x∗ ) := {x ∈ X : x∗ ∈ J (x)} also satisfies
J −1 (x∗ ) = {x ∈ X : hx∗ , xi = kxk2 = kx∗ k2 }.
Since X is reflexive, X = X ∗∗ and so J −1 is the duality mapping of X ∗ . The properties of J are closely
related to the geometry of the spaces X and X ∗ . Recall that a real Banach space is uniformly convex iff
for every 0 < ε < 2 there is some δ > 0 so that for any two vectors with kxk = 1 and kyk = 1, the
condition kx − yk ≥ ε implies that kx + yk ≤ 2(1 − δ). Clearly, uniformly convex Banach space is also strictly
convex, i.e., for any two distinct vectors with kxk = 1 and kyk = 1 we have kx + yk < 2. Moreover, the
Milman–Pettis theorem states that every uniformly convex Banach space is reflexive, while the converse is
not true.
Proposition 2.1 (see [2, Theorem 1.2]) If the dual space X ∗ is strictly convex, then the duality mapping
J : X → X ∗ is single-valued and demicontinuous. If the space X ∗ is uniformly convex, then J is uniformly
continuous on every bounded subset of X.
The effective domain dom f of an extended real-valued function f : X → R := R ∪ {+∞} is the set of
points x where f (x) ∈ R. The function f is proper if domf 6= ∅. It is lower semicontinuous if
f (x) ≤ lim inf f (y)
y→x

for all x ∈ X. The epigraph of f is defined by
epi f := {(x, r) : x ∈ domf, r ≥ f (x)}.

Suppose now that f is a convex lower semicontinuous function, i.e. epi f is convex and closed in X × R. A
functional x∗ ∈ X ∗ is said to be a subgradient of f at x ∈ X, if f (x) is finite and
f (y) − f (x) ≥ hx∗ , y − xi,

∀y ∈ X.

The collection of all subgradients of f at x is called the subdifferential of f at x, that is,
∂f (x) := {x∗ ∈ X ∗ : f (y) − f (x) ≥ hx∗ , y − xi, ∀y ∈ X}.
The function f is said to be subdifferentiable at x if f (x) is finite and ∂f (x) 6= ∅. Clearly, ∂f (x) is convex and
weakly closed in X ∗ . The following result represents the graphical density of points of subdifferentiability
of f (see [4] and [9]).
Proposition 2.2 Let f be a proper lower semicontinuous convex function from X into R. Then for any
x̄ ∈ dom f and any ε > 0 there exists x ∈ X such that ∂f (x) 6= ∅ and
kx − x̄k + |f (x) − f (x̄)| < ε.
Given a nonempty set S ⊂ X, int S is the interior of S, S is the closure of S and bd(S) is the boundary
of S with respect to strong topology on X. Suppose now that S is nonempty closed and convex. For every
x ∈ S, the tangent cone and the normal cone of S at x (see [3, Section 2.2.4] or [1, Section 4.2]) are defined
respectively as
T (x; S) :=

[

t−1 (S − x),

N (x; S) := {x∗ ∈ X ∗ : sup hx∗ , y − xi ≤ 0}.

(1)

y∈S

t>0

The tangent cone can be expressed in terms of sequences [1, Proposition 4.2.1] as
T (x; S) = {v ∈ X : ∃ sequences tn ↓ 0, vn → v with x + tn vn ∈ S for all n ∈ N} .

(2)

By the bipolar theorem [3, Proposition 2.40] we have the following dual relationships
T (x; S) = {v ∈ X :

sup

hx∗ , vi ≤ 0},

x∗ ∈N (x;S)

N (x; S) = {x∗ ∈ X ∗ :

sup

hx∗ , vi ≤ 0}.

v∈T (x;S)

The function IS : X → R defined by

if x ∈ S,

otherwise,

is called the indicator function of S and its dual function σS : X ∗ → R,
σS (x∗ ) := sup{hx∗ , si : s ∈ S},

∀x∗ ∈ X ∗ ,

(4)

is called the support function of S (see [17, p. 79]).
Similarly, for a nonempty closed and convex set K ⊂ X ∗ and x∗ ∈ K, we can define the normal cone
N (x∗ ; K) ⊂ X and the tangent cone T (x∗ ; K) ⊂ X ∗ of K at x∗ as (1). The indicator function IK : X ∗ → R

and the support function σK : X → R are also defined similarly as (3) and (4) respectively. Since X is
reflexive, both σS and σK are lower semicontinuous and convex.
For the set-valued operator A : X ⇒ X ∗ , the domain of A is D(A) := {x ∈ X : Ax 6= ∅} and
G(A) := {(x, x∗ ) ∈ X×X ∗ : x∗ ∈ Ax} is the graph of A. Recall that A is monotone, iff for all (x, x∗ ), (y, y ∗ ) ∈
G(A), one has hx∗ − y ∗ , x − yi ≥ 0, and maximally monotone iff A is monotone and A has no proper
monotone extension (in the sense of graph inclusion). The duality mapping, the subdifferential of a lower
semicontinuous proper convex function, the normal cone to a closed convex set are examples of maximal
monotone operators (see [16, Theorem A]). The maximal monotone operator A has closed convex values
and is demiclosed [2, Proposition 2.1], i.e., A satisfies


x∗n ∈ Axn (∀n ∈ N), x∗n → x∗ , xn ⇀ x =⇒ x∗ ∈ Ax ,



x∗n ∈ Axn (∀n ∈ N), x∗n ⇀ x∗ , xn → x =⇒ x∗ ∈ Ax .

Since X is reflexive, D(A) is nearly convex (see [6, Corollary 3.4]), i.e., D(A) is convex. Moreover, if
int D(A) 6= ∅ then int D(A) = int D(A) (see [14, Theorem 27.1 and Theorem 27.3]) and A is locally bounded
at every x ∈ int D(A) (see [12, Theorem 2.28] or [15, Theorem 1]), i.e., there exist r > 0 and M > 0 such
that x + rB ⊂ D(A) and
sup ky ∗ k ≤ M,

∀y ∈ x + rB.

y ∗ ∈Ay

Conversely, if x ∈ D(A) and A is locally bounded at x, then x ∈ int D(A) (see [13, Theorem 1.14] or [17,
Theorem 3.11.15]).
If X ∗ is uniformly convex then for every x ∈ D(A), since Ax is nonempty closed and convex, there exists a
unique point x∗min ∈ Ax such that
kx∗min k = min{kx∗ k : x∗ ∈ Ax}
(see [8, Exercise 3.32]). Therefore, the single-valued nonlinear operator
A◦ : D(A) ⊂ X → X ∗ ,

A◦ x := x∗min

is well-defined; it is called the minimal-norm selection of A. Let us end this section by recalling some results
related to the Yosida approximation of a maximal monotone operator (see [2, Proposition 2.2]).
Proposition 2.3 Suppose that both X and X ∗ are reflexive and strictly convex, and A : X ⇒ X ∗ is a
maximal monotone operator. For every x ∈ X and λ > 0, there exists a unique xλ ∈ X such that
0 ∈ J (xλ − x) + λA(xλ ).
If x ∈ D(A) then xλ → x and λ−1 J (x − xλ ) ⇀ A◦ (x) as λ → 0. Moreover, if X ∗ is uniformly convex, then
λ−1 J (x − xλ ) → A◦ (x) as λ → 0 for every x ∈ D(A).

3 Representation Formulas in Uniformly Convex Spaces
In this section, we will establish representation formulas for faces and supports functions in uniformly convex
spaces with uniformly convex duals. First, we recall the notion of the face associated with direction of the
values of a maximal monotone operator.
Definition 3.1 Let X be a real reflexive Banach space and A : X ⇒ X ∗ a maximal monotone operator.
For x ∈ D(A) and v ∈ X, we define the set
A(x; v) := {x∗ ∈ Ax : hx∗ , vi = σAx (v)}.
If v 6= 0 then A(x; v) is called the face associated with direction v of the value Ax.
Remark 3.1 By the definition of the support function, x∗ ∈ A(x; v) if and only if v ∈ NAx (x∗ ), i.e., x∗ ∈ Ax
and
hy ∗ − x∗ , vi ≤ 0,

∀y ∗ ∈ Ax.

Moreover, A(x; v) is the subdifferential of the convex function σAx at v (see [3, Proposition 2.121]) and so
it is closed and convex.
We give two examples of faces associated with directions of values of maximal monotone operators.
Example 3.1

A(0; v) =

If x ∈ B then A(x; v) = Ax = {0X ∗ } for all v ∈ X. If x ∈ bd(B), i.e., kxk = 1, then

A(x; v) =

if

σJ(x) (v) < 0,

if

σJ(x) (v) > 0,

where S := {ξ ∈ X ∗ : ξ ∈ J (x), hξ, vi = 0}.

Definition 3.2 Let X be a real reflexive Banach space and A : X ⇒ X ∗ a maximal monotone operator.
For every x ∈ D(A) and v ∈ X we define the following sets
n

Lim sup A(x + tw) := x∗ ∈ X ∗ | ∃ sequences wn → v, tn ↓ 0 and x∗n → x∗
w→v,t↓0

o

with x∗n ∈ A(x + tn wn ) for all n ∈ N ,
n

w − Lim sup A(x + tw) := x∗ ∈ X ∗ | ∃ sequences wn → v, tn ↓ 0 and x∗n ⇀ x∗
w→v,t↓0

o

with x∗n ∈ A(x + tn wn ) for all n ∈ N .

Remark 3.2 Observe that we have the following inclusions
Lim sup A(x + tw) ⊂ w − Lim sup A(x + tw) ⊂ A(x; v).
w→v,t↓0

(5)

w→v,t↓0

The first inclusion follows from Definition 3.2 while the second one is proved similarly as in the proof
of [10, Theorem 3.2].
When the operator A is defined on a uniformly convex space with uniformly convex dual we obtain the
equalities in (5).
Theorem 3.1 Let X be a real Banach space such that X and X ∗ are uniformly convex. Let A : X ⇒ X ∗
be a maximal monotone operator. For every x ∈ D(A) and v ∈ X \ {0} we have
A(x; v) = Lim sup A(x + tw) = w − Lim sup A(x + tw).
w→v,t↓0

(6)

w→v,t↓0

Proof From (5), to get (6) it suffices to check
A(x; v) ⊂ Limsup A(x + tw).

(7)

w→v,t↓0

Suppose that x∗ ∈ A(x; v). Let J be the duality mapping on X. Since X and X ∗ are uniformly convex, by
Proposition 2.1, both J and J −1 are single-valued and continuous with respect to strong topology on X
and X ∗ . Consider the operator B : X ⇒ X ∗ given by
By := Ay − J (v) − x∗ ,

∀y ∈ X.

Clearly, B is maximal monotone and dom B = dom A. We first show that B ◦ x = −J (v). Indeed, since
x∗ ∈ A(x; v) we have x∗ ∈ Ax and so
−J (v) = x∗ − J (v) − x∗ ∈ Ax − J (v) − x∗ = Bx.

Moreover, for every y ∗ ∈ Ax we have hx∗ − y ∗ , vi ≥ 0 and
k − J (v)k = kvk−1 hJ (v), vi
≤ kvk−1 hJ (v) + x∗ − y ∗ , vi
≤ kvk−1 ky ∗ − J (v) − x∗ kkvk
= ky ∗ − J (v) − x∗ k.
Applying Proposition 2.3 for the maximal monotone operator B and x ∈ domB, we can construct a sequence
{xn } ⊂ X such that
0 ∈ J (xn − x) +
lim xn = x,

and

n→∞

B(xn ),
n

(8)

lim [nJ (x − xn )] = −J (v).

(9)

n→∞

Consider the sequence {wn } ⊂ X given by wn := n(xn − x) for every n ∈ N. Then, by (8) and (9), we have
−J (wn ) + J (v) + x∗ ∈ B(xn ) + J (v) + x∗ = A(xn ) = A(x + (1/n)wn ),
lim wn = lim [J −1J (n(xn − x))] = J −1 [J (v)] = v,

n→∞

n→∞

lim [−J (wn ) + J (v) + x∗ ] = x∗ .

n→∞

It follows that x∗ ∈ Limsup A(x + tw) and so (7) holds.

Remark 3.3
– Theorem 3.1 generalizes [10, Theorem 3.2] from Hilbert spaces to uniformly convex Banach spaces
having uniformly convex duals. Our proof is based on the properties of Yosida approximation of maximal
monotone operators and it is simpler than the proof of [10, Theorem 3.2] where the authors used the
properties of solutions of differential inclusions governed by maximal monotone operators.
– We formulate in the context of uniformly convex spaces since our proof strongly depends on the singlevaluedness and the strong continuity of the duality mapping and its inverse.

The formulas in (6) allow us to characterize the boundaries of the values of maximal monotone operators,
by means only of the values at nearby points, which are close enough to the reference point but distinct of
it (see [10, Theorem 3.1] in Hilbert setting).
Corollary 3.1 Let X be a real Banach space such that X and X ∗ are uniformly convex. Let A : X ⇒ X ∗
be a maximal monotone operator. Then, for every x ∈ D(A), we have
n

∗
→ x∗ with
bd(Ax) = Lim sup A(y) := x∗ ∈ X ∗ | ∃ sequences yn → x and yn
y→x,y6=x

Proof Let x ∈ D(A). Observe that Ax can be represented by its faces in the directions as


bd(Ax) = 

[

v6=0



A(x; v).

(11)

Indeed, by the closeness of bd(Ax), the set on the right hand side of (11) is the subset of bd(Ax). Hence, we
only need to check the reverse inclusion in (11). If x∗ ∈ bd(Ax), since Ax = dom IAx , then x∗ ∈ dom IAx
and x∗ ∈
/ int(dom IAx ). Therefore, by the maximal monotonicity of the subdifferential mapping, ∂IAx is not
locally bounded at x∗ [13, Theorem 1.14], i.e., we can find a sequence {x∗n } ⊂ Ax such that x∗n → x∗ and
N (x∗n ; Ax) = ∂IAx (x∗n ) is not bounded for every n ∈ N. Let {vn } ⊂ X be such that vn ∈ N (x∗n ; Ax) \ {0}
for every n ∈ N. Then, x∗n ∈ A(x; vn ) with vn 6= 0 for every n ∈ N and so x∗ belongs the set on the right
hand side of (11).
Now we use (6) and (11) to get (10). We have,


bd(Ax) = 

[



Limsup A(x + tw) ⊂ Lim sup A(y) = Lim sup A(y).

v6=0 w→v,t↓0

y→x,y6=x

y→x,y6=x

Suppose that x∗ ∈ Lim sup A(y). Then, there exist sequences {xn } ⊂ X and {x∗n } ⊂ X ∗ such that xn →
y→x,y6=x

x, x∗n → x∗ and xn 6= x, x∗n ∈ Axn for every n ∈ N. By the maximal monotonicity of A, we have x∗ ∈ Ax.
We will show that x∗ ∈ bd(Ax). Suppose on the contrary that x∗ ∈ int(Ax). Then, for sufficiently large n,
we have x∗n ∈ int(Ax) ⊂ Ax and so x∗n ∈ A(x; xn − x) with xn − x 6= 0. By (11), for sufficiently large n,
x∗n ∈ bd(Ax) which is a contradiction.

✷

Now, we use Theorem 3.1 to obtain a representation for the support function of the values of A via its
minimal-norm selection A◦ . First, we consider a relationship of A(x; v) and A◦ when A(x; v) is nonempty.
Lemma 3.1 Suppose that X and X ∗ are uniformly convex Banach spaces. Let A : X ⇒ X ∗ be a maximal
monotone operator. If x ∈ D(A) and v ∈ X \ {0} such that A(x; v) 6= ∅ then
n

w − Limsup A◦ (x + tw) := x∗ ∈ X ∗ | ∃ sequences wn → v, tn ↓ 0 such that A◦ (x + tn wn ) ⇀ x∗
w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D(A)

(12)
o

and x + tn wn ∈ D(A) for all n ∈ N .
is a nonempty subset of A(x; v).
Proof By Theorem 3.1, the set in (12) is a subset of A(x; v) and since A(x; v) 6= ∅ we have
w − Lim sup A(x + tw) 6= ∅.
w→v,t↓0

Let x∗ belong to this set. Then, there exist sequences tn ↓ 0, wn → v, x∗n ⇀ x∗ with x∗n ∈ A(x + tn wn )
for every n ∈ N. It follows that x + tn wn ∈ D(A) for every n ∈ N and {x∗n } is bounded in X ∗ . Since
kA◦ (x + tn wn )k ≤ kx∗n k , {A◦ (x + tn wn )} is also bounded in X ∗ . Since X ∗ is reflexive, the sequence
{A◦ (x + tn wn )} has a subsequence converging weakly to some x̄ ∈ X ∗ and it belongs to the set in (12). ✷

The next example shows that the following inclusion
w − Limsup A◦ (x + tw) ⊂ A(x; v)
w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D(A)

may be strict.
Example 3.2 Let X be a real Hilbert space and Ax = N (x; B). Let x0 , v0 ∈ H be such that
kx0 k = kv0 k = 1
It is clear that w −

and

hx0 , v0 i = 0.

A◦ (x0 + tw) = {0} (since A◦ x = 0 for all x ∈ B) while

w→v0 ,t↓0
x0 +tw∈D(A)

A(x0 ; v0 ) = Ax0 = R+ x0
(since hv0 , x∗ i = 0 for all x∗ ∈ Ax0 ).
Theorem 3.2 Suppose that X and X ∗ are uniformly convex Banach spaces. Let A : X ⇒ X ∗ be a maximal
monotone operator. For every x ∈ D(A) and v ∈ X \ {0}, we have

σAx (v) =

hA◦ (x + tw), wi

if v ∈ T (x; D(A)),

+∞

otherwise.

Proof If v ∈
/ T (x; D(A)) then there exists x∗ ∈ N (x; D(A)) such that hx∗ , vi > 0. Then, for every y ∗ ∈ Ax
and t > 0, we have y ∗ + tx∗ ∈ Ax + N (x; D(A)) = Ax by the maximal monotonicity of A. It follows that
σAx (v) ≥ hy ∗ , vi + thx∗ , vi. Taking t → +∞ in the latter inequality, we get σAx (v) = +∞.
Suppose now that v ∈ T (x; D(A)). It follows from (2) that there exist sequences tn ↓ 0, wn → v with
x + tn wn ∈ D(A) for all n ∈ N. Let (tn ) and (wn ) be any such sequences. Then, we have
σAx (wn ) ≤ hA◦ (x + tn wn ), wn i.

(14)

Indeed, by the monotonicity of A, for every x∗ ∈ Ax, we have
hA◦ (x + tn wn ) − x∗ , wi = t−1 hA◦ (x + tn wn ) − x∗ , x + tn wn − xi ≥ 0.
Hence, hA◦ (x + tn wn ), wn i ≥ hx∗ , wn i for every x∗ ∈ Ax and so (14) holds. Taking n → ∞ in (14), by the
lower semicontinuity of σAx , we get
σAx (v) ≤ lim inf hA◦ (x + tn wn ), wn i.
n→∞

Hence,
σAx (v) ≤

Now we establish the reverse inequality when σAx (v) < +∞. To do this, we only need to point out the
existence of the sequences tn ↓ 0, wn → v with x + tn wn ∈ D(A) for every n ∈ N such that
hA◦ (x + tn wn ), wn i → σAx (v).

Applying Proposition 2.2 for the proper lower semicontinuous convex function σAx and v ∈ dom σAx , we
can find a sequence (vn ) ⊂ X such that vn → v, σAx (vn ) → σAx (v) and A(x; vn ) = ∂σAx (vn ) 6= ∅. By

and setting tn := tn
m , wn := wm . Then, tn ↓ 0, wn → v with x + tn wn ∈ D(A) for every n ∈ N and

hA◦ (x + tn wn ), wn i → σAx (v). Hence, we have the equality in (15).

✷

Remark 3.4 It follows from (13) that (x, x∗ ) ∈ G(A) if and only if x ∈ D(A) and the following inequality
hx∗ − A◦ y, x − yi ≥ 0

(17)

holds for all y in some neighborhood of x. Indeed, by Theorem 3.2, if v ∈ T (x; D(A)) then
σAx (v) =

Therefore, σAx (v) ≥ hx∗ , vi for all v ∈ X and so (x, x∗ ) ∈ G(A).
The formula (13) helps us to establish a local reconstruction of a maximal monotone operator from its
minimal-norm selection.
Corollary 3.2 Suppose that X and X ∗ are uniformly convex Banach spaces. Let A1 and A2 be maximal
monotone operators from X to X ∗ . If there exist x0 ∈ D(A1 )∩D(A2) and r > 0 such that D(A1 )∩B(x0 ; r) =
D(A2 ) ∩ B(x0 ; r) and A◦1 = A◦2 on D(A1 ) ∩ B(x0 ; r) then A1 = A2 on D(A1 ) ∩ B(x0 ; r). In particular, if
D(A1 ) = D(A2 ) and A◦1 = A◦2 then A1 = A2 .
Proof Let x0 ∈ D(A1 )∩D(A2 ) and r > 0 be such that D(A1 )∩B(x0 ; r) = D(A2 )∩B(x0 ; r) and A◦1 = A◦2 on
D(A1 ) ∩ B(x0 ; r). Let x ∈ D(A1 ) ∩ B(x0 ; r). By Theorem 3.2 and our assumptions, we obtain σA1 x = σA2 x .
Hence, we have
A1 x = A1 (x; 0) = ∂σA1 x (0)
= ∂σA2 x (0) = A2 (x; 0) = A2 x.
✷
The next corollary presents a local decomposition of maximal monotone operator provided that its
minimal-norm selection is locally bounded. As a consequence, if the minimal-norm selection of a maximal
monotone operator is bounded with some modulus around some interior point of the domain then the whole
values of the maximal monotone operator are also bounded with the same modulus around that point.

Corollary 3.3 Let A be a maximal monotone operator from X to X ∗ and x ∈ D(A). Suppose that there
exist r > 0 and ρ > 0 such that
kA◦ yk ≤ ρ,

∀y ∈ B(x; r) ∩ D(A).

(18)

Then, for every y ∈ B(x; r) ∩ D(A), we have
Ay ⊂ N (y; D(A)) + ρB∗ .

(19)

In particular, if B(x; r) ⊂ D(A) then Ay ⊂ ρB∗ for every y ∈ B(x; r).
Proof Let y ∈ B(x; r) ∩ D(A) and y ∗ ∈ Ay. We first show that
hy ∗ , z − yi ≤ ρkz − yk,

∀z ∈ D(A).

(20)

Indeed, for every z ∈ D(A) \ {y}, z − y ∈ T (y; D(A)) \ {0}, and by Theorem 3.2 and (18)
hy ∗ , z − yi ≤ σAy (z − y)

Hence, (20) holds and so y ∗ ∈ N (y; D(A)) + ρB∗ . Therefore, (19) is satisfied.
If B(x; r) ⊂ D(A) then N (y; D(A)) = {0} for every y ∈ B(x; r). By (19) we have Ay ⊂ ρB∗ for all y in
this set.

4 Representation Formulas in Reflexive Spaces
In this section, we will work with maximal monotone operators having their domains with nonempty interiors
in reflexive Banach spaces. Under these assumptions, we could refine the formulas obtained in the previous
section. First, we show that the faces can be represented via the limit values of any selection of maximal
monotone operators.
Lemma 4.1 Let X be a reflexive real Banach space and A : X ⇒ X ∗ a maximal monotone operator such
that int(D(A)) 6= ∅. Let D be dense subset of D(A) and Ã be a selection of A. For every x ∈ D(A), v ∈
int(D(A) − x), the following set
n

w − Limsup Ã(x + tw) := x∗ ∈ X ∗ | ∃ sequences wn → v, tn ↓ 0 such that Ã(x + tn wn ) ⇀ x∗
w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D

(21)
o

and x + tn wn ∈ D for all n ∈ N .
is a nonempty subset of A(x; v).

Faces and Support Functions for the Values of Maximal Monotone Operators

13

Proof Let x ∈ D(A) and v ∈ int(D(A) − x). From (5), we have
ω − Limsup Ã(x + tw) ⊂ ω − Limsup A(x + tw) ⊂ A(x; v).
w→v,t↓0

w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D

Since x + v ∈ int(D(A)), A is locally bounded around x + v , i.e., there exist r, M > 0 such that Ay 6= ∅
and Ay ⊂ M B for all y ∈ x + v + 4rB. According to [5, Lemma 4.1], there exists K > 0 such that
∅ 6= Az ⊂ KB, ∀z ∈ (x, x + v + 2rB],

(22)

where
(x, x + v + 2rB] := {λx + (1 − λ)z : λ ∈]0, 1], z ∈ x + v + 2rB}.
Picking any sequences {tn } ⊂ R+ and {wn } ⊂ X converging to 0 and v, respectively, and satisfying
x + tn wn ∈ (x, x + v + rB] for all n ∈ N. Since D is dense on D(A), for each n ∈ N, we can find νn such
that x + tn (wn + νn ) ∈ D and
kνn k ≤

1
,
n

wn + νn ∈ v + 2rB.

(23)

Combining (22) and (23), we arrive at wn + νn → v as n → +∞ and
Ã(x + tn (wn + νn )) ∈ A(x + tn (wn + νn )) ⊂ KB,

∀n ∈ N.

Since X ∗ is reflexive, without loss of generality, we can assume that Ã(x + tn (wn + νn )) ⇀ ξ as n → +∞
and so ξ ∈ w − Limsup Ã(x + tw).

✷

w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D

Second, we use Lemma 4.1 to improve the representation formula (13) in Theorem 3.2.
Theorem 4.1 Let X be a reflexive real Banach space and A : X ⇒ X ∗ a maximal monotone operator such
that int(D(A)) 6= ∅. Let D be dense subset of D(A) and Ã be a selection of A. For every x ∈ D(A) and
v ∈ X \ {0}

otherwise,

w→v,t↓0

Proof Since D(A) has nonempty interior, D(A) is convex and int(D(A)) = int(D(A)) (see [14, Theorem 27.1
and Theorem 27.3]). Let x ∈ D(A) and v ∈ X \ {0}. We consider three cases of v.
Case 1.

v∈
/ T (x; D(A))

Repeating the first part of the proof of Theorem 3.2 we get σAx (v) = +∞.
Case 2.

v ∈ int T (x; D(A))

By [1, Proposition 4.2.3], the interior of the tangent cone can be expressed as

Hence, there exists h > 0 such that hv ∈ int(D(A) − x). Applying Lemma 4.1, the following sets are
nonempty and
w − Limsup Ã(x + tw) = w − Limsup Ã(x + tw) ⊂ A(x; hv) = A(x; v).
w→hv,t↓0
x+tw∈D

w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D

Then, for every ξ ∈ w − Limsup Ã(x + tw), we have σAx (v) = hξ, vi.
w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D

Case 3.



v ∈ bd T (x; D(A))



Since A is monotone, for every w ∈ X and t > 0 such that x + tw ∈ D ⊂ D(A), we have
hx∗ , wi ≤ hÃ(x + tw), wi,

∀x∗ ∈ Ax.

This yields that
σAx (v) ≤ lim inf hÃ(x + tw), wi.

(25)

w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D

Picking v0 ∈ int T (x; D(A)) . From Case 2., we have σAx (v0 ) < +∞. Consider the sequence {vn } given
by

vn :=

n−1

v0 +
v,
n
n

∀n ∈ N.

On one hand, since σAx is convex, we have
σAx (vn ) ≤

n−1
1
σAx (v0 ) +
σAx (v)
n
n

Taking the superior limit both sides of the above inequality we get
lim sup σAx (vn ) ≤ σAx (v).
n→∞

Then, the lower semicontinuity of σAx implies that
lim σAx (vn ) = σAx (v).

(26)

n→∞



On the other hand, the convexity of T (x; D(A)) implies that vn ∈ int T (x; D(A)) for all n ∈ N. As in the
proof of Case 2., for every n ∈ N

∅ 6= w − Limsup Ã(x + tw) ⊂ A(x; vn ).
w→vn ,t↓0

Then, there exist sequences {tn } ⊂ R+ , {wn } ⊂ X such that

for every n ∈ N . Clearly, tn ↓ 0, wn → v and by (26)
lim hÃ(x + tn wn ), wn i = σAx (v).

n→∞

Combining this and (25) we get
σAx (v) = lim inf hÃ(x + tw), wi.
w→v,t↓0

✷
Finally, we employ Theorem 4.1 and [5, Proposition 5.1] to get the global decompositions for maximal
monotone operators. Our proof follows the technique of [5, Theorem 5.2].
Corollary 4.1 Let X be a reflexive real Banach space and A : X ⇒ X ∗ a maximal monotone operator such
that int(D(A)) 6= ∅. Let D be dense subset of D(A) and Ã be a selection of A. Then, for every x ∈ X,



It is clear that K ⊂ Ax. When x ∈
/ D(A), both side of (29) are empty sets, hence we can assume that
x ∈ D(A). We will use Theorem 4.1 to show that
σAx (v) ≤ σK (v),

∀v ∈ int(TD(A) )(x).

(30)

Let v ∈ int(TD(A) )(x) \ {0}. By Theorem 4.1, there exist ξ ∈ w − Limsup Ã(x + tw) such that σAx (v) =
w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D

hξ, vi. On the other hand, by the formula for the interior of tangent cone, there exist h > 0 such that
hv ∈ int(D(A) − x). This implies that ξ ∈ K since
w − Limsup Ã(x + tw) = w − Limsup Ã(x + tw).
w→v,t↓0
x+tw∈D

w→hv,t↓0

Hence, (30) is satisfied. According to [5, Proposition 5.1], we get
Ax ⊂ K + N(x; D(A)).
Now we show that
K + N(x; D(A)) = K + N(x; D(A)).
Let x∗ ∈ K + N (x; D(A)). There exist {s∗n } ⊂ K, {νn∗ } ⊂ N (x; D(A)) such that s∗n + νn∗ → x∗ . We will
show that both {s∗n } and {νn∗ } are bounded. Suppose on the contrary that {νn∗ } has a subsequence {νn∗k }
such that kνn∗k k → ∞. Without loss of generality, we assume that
νn∗k
s∗nk
∗
⇀
ξ
and
⇀ −ξ ∗ .
kνn∗k k
kνn∗k k
Let x0 ∈ int(D(A)) and r > 0 be such that x0 + rB ⊂ int(D(A)). Then,


νn∗k
, x − x0
kνn∗k k



≥ r,

∀k ∈ N.

Taking the limit both sides of the latter inequality, we get hξ ∗ , x − x0 i ≥ r. On the other hand, for some
x∗0 ∈ Ax0 , since s∗nk ∈ K ⊂ Ax, we have by the monotonicity of A that


s∗nk
, x − x0
kνn∗k k



≥

hx∗0 , x − x0 i
,
kνn∗k k

∀k ∈ N.

Again, taking the limit both sides of the latter inequality we also get h−ξ ∗ , x − x0 i ≥ 0 which is a contradiction. Therefore, both {νn∗ } and {s∗n } are bounded. Since X is reflexive, there exist subsequences {νn∗k }, {s∗nk }
of {νn∗ } and {s∗n } respectively such that νn∗k ⇀ ν ∗ ∈ K and s∗nk ⇀ s∗ ∈ N (x; D(A)). Hence, we have that
x∗ = ν ∗ + s∗ ∈ K + N (x; D(A)).
✷
Remark 4.1 The formula (28) has a similar form to the representation formula in [5, Theorem 5.2]. The first
term on the right hand-side of the representation in [5, Theorem 5.2] is the closure convex hull of the limit
values of the given maximal monotone operator on a dense subset of its domain while the first term on the
right hand-side of (28) is only represented by the closure convex hull of the limit values of any selection of
that maximal monotone operator. One of the usefulness of this representation is to allow us to prove the
unique determination of maximal monotone operators on dense subsets of their domains and characterize
the Lipschitz continuity of a convex function.
Corollary 4.2 Let X be a reflexive real Banach space and A, B : X ⇒ X ∗ be two maximal monotone
operator such that int(D(A)) = int(D(B)) 6= ∅. If there exists a dense subset D of D(A) such that
Ax ∩ Bx 6= ∅
then A = B.

∀x ∈ D,

(31)

Faces and Support Functions for the Values of Maximal Monotone Operators

17

Proof Since int(D(A)) = int(D(B)), we have

D(A) = int(D(A)) = int(D(B)) = D(B).

From (31), we can find selections Ã of A and B̃ of B such that Ã = B̃ on D. Applying Corollary 4.1, for
every x ∈ X, we have

Ax = co

✷

We end this section by the following example.
Example 4.1 Let X be a reflexive real Banach space and f : X → R a lower semicontinuous convex function.
Suppose that there exist a dense subset D of X and ℓ ≥ 0 such that

∂f (x) ∩ ℓB∗ 6= ∅,

∀x ∈ D.

Then, f is ℓ−Lipschitz continuous on X, i.e.,

|f (x) − f (y)| ≤ ℓkx − yk,

∀x, y ∈ X.

Indeed, under our assumptions, it follows from (28) that

∂f (x) ⊂ ℓB∗ ,

∀x ∈ X,

which implies that f is ℓ−Lipschitz continuous on X.

5 Conclusions
We have provided representation formulas for faces and support functions for the values of maximal monotone operators in reflexive Banach spaces. The obtained representation formulas help us to prove the local
unique determination of a maximal monotone operator from its minimal-norm selection or on a dense subset
of its domain. Some local and global decompositions for maximal monotone operators are also established.
Further developments will be devoted to extending our results to arbitrary Banach spaces.
