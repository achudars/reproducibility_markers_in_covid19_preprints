Abstract
Photodisintegration of polarized 3 He by linearly or circularily polarized photons oﬀers a rich
choice of observables which can be calculated with high precision using a rigorous scheme of threenucleon Faddeev equations. Using the (semi)phenomenological AV18 nucleon-nucleon potential
combined with the Urbana IX three-nucleon force we investigate sensitivity of 3 He photodisintegration observables to underlying currents taken in the form of a single-nucleon current supplemented by two-body contributions for π- and ρ-meson exchanges or incorporated by the Siegert
theorem. Promising observables to be measured for two- and three-body fragmentation of 3 He
are identiﬁed. These observables form a challenging test ground for consistent forces and currents
being under derivation within the framework of chiral perturbation theory. For thre-body 3 He
photodisintegration several kinematicaly complete conﬁgurations, including SST and FSI, are also
discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Application of eﬀective ﬁeld theoretical methods in the form of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) puts investigation of properties of nuclear systems and their reactions on a
new qualitative and quantitative level. Derivation of consistent two- and many-body internucleonic forces, and particularly the construction of nucleon-nucleon (NN) [1–5] and
three-nucleon (3N) [6–8] interactions up to a fourth (N4 LO) order of the chiral expansion,
provided a well grounded nuclear Hamiltonian, allowing for investigations of the importance
of a three-nucleon force on a much more solid theoretical basis [9–12].
Progress in the development of numerical methods for nuclear structure calculations
together with the availability of rigorous treatments of few-nucleon reactions within the
Faddeev scheme made it possible to apply chiral two- and three-nucleon forces in nuclear
structure and 3N reaction calculations, and, by comparison of theoretical predictions to
data, to test the underlying dynamics. In this respect, the 3N system for which a large data
base of high precision cross sections and spin observables is available ([13–23] and references

therein) for elastic nucleon-deuteron (Nd) scattering and the deuteron breakup reaction is
especially important.
For the electromagnetic sector an additional ingredient, the electromagnetic current has
to be included. Investigations of its structure are less advanced due to experimental diﬃculties as well as due to the lack of a consistent treatment of forces and currents [24]. This
situation has changed with the recent derivations of electro-weak currents within ChPT [25–
30], which are, at least partly, consistent up to a given order of the chiral expansion to the
corresponding chiral nuclear interaction 1 . With the advent of consistent forces and currents
the number of reactions in which details of chiral dynamics can be studied will increase
signiﬁcantly. One of such reactions is photodisintegration of 3 He which can lead to two- and
three-body fragmentation in the ﬁnal state. For energies of the incoming photons below the
π-production threshold the Faddeev scheme allows one to get numerically exact predictions.
This, together with the fact, that photodisintegration of 3 He oﬀers numerous observables,
seems to predispose these reactions to become a valuable tool to test the dynamics with its
electromagnetic current operator ingredient.
With the availability of low energy high intensity polarized photon beams [31, 32] and
polarized 3 He targets [33, 34] a set of observables oﬀered by two- and three-body photodisintegration of 3 He, which could be measured with suﬃcient precision, is substantially extended
and includes, in addition to the unpolarized cross section, also analyzing powers and spin
correlation coeﬃcients.
It is the aim of the present study to investigate the sensitivity of observables in low
~ photodisintegration to underlying currents. In anticipation of application
energy ~γ + 3 He
of consistent chiral interactions and currents we use the (semi)phenomenological AV18 [35]
nucleon-nucleon potential combined with the Urbana IX [36] three-nucleon force and the
current operator taken in the form of a single nucleon current supplemented by two-body
contributions either in the form of explicit π- and ρ-meson exchanges or incorporated by the
Siegert theorem [37]. We solve the 3N Faddeev equations for 3 He photodisintegration [37]
with such dynamics and calculate all possible observables for two- and three-body fragmentation of polarized 3 He induced with linearly or circularily polarized photons, investigating
their sensitivity to the underlying current.

Note that despite the fact that the operator form of chiral currents is known at the lowest orders, applications of chiral many-nucleon forces and currents in practical 3N calculations is presently questionable
due to the lack of their consistent regularization.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we brieﬂy describe the theoretical formalism
and derive expressions for polarization observables in 3 He photodisintegration induced by
circularily or linearly polarized photons interacting with a polarized 3 He. We present and
discuss results for two- and three-body fragmentation of 3 He in Sec. III and summarize and
conclude in Sec. IV.

II.

THEORETICAL FORMALISM

In the following we present brieﬂy our treatment of 3 He photodisintegration within the
Faddeev scheme. For details of the theoretical formalism and numerical performance we
refer the reader to [37, 38].
The basic quantities from which all observables for photodisintegration of 3 He can be

of the 3 He current operator ~jλ (λ = ±1) between the initial 3 He state |ΨmHe > with the

spin projection m onto the z-axis deﬁned by the momentum of the incoming photon, and
(−)

the ﬁnal 3N scattering state |Ψf,{µi } >, which is either two-body proton-deuteron (pd) or
three-body proton-proton-neutron (ppn) fragmentation, with corresponding spin projections
of the outgoing particles {µi }.
Assuming that three nucleons interact with two- and three-nucleon forces, and writing
down 3N Faddeev equations for the Faddeev components of 3N scattering states, allows us
to express the nuclear matrix elements for two- and three-body fragmentation of 3 He in
terms of an auxiliary state |Ũ >, which fulﬁlls the following Faddeev-like equation [37]:

|Ũ > = [tG0 + (1 + P )V (1) G0 (1 + tG0 )](1 + P )~jλ |ΨmHe >

The permutation operator P ≡ P12 P23 +P13 P23 is given by interchanges Pij of nucleons i and
j and the NN t-operator t results from the employed NN potential through the two-body
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. V (1) is a part of a 3N force operator V123 = V (1) +V (2) +V (3) ,
which is symmetrical under exchange of nucleons 2 and 3.

with |φq >≡ |ϕd µd > |~qp µp >, where |ϕd > is the internal deuteron state, µd and µp are
the deuteron and proton spin projections, respectively, and ~qp is a relative proton-deuteron
momentum.
For three-body breakup the nuclear matrix element is given by [37]:

and p~, q~ are standard Jacobi momenta.

Some of these observables vanish for two- as well as for three-body in plane photodisintegration of 3 He. Namely, assuming that outgoing particles move in a plane, which contains

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To investigate the sensitivity of low energy 3 He photodisintegration observables to the
underlying current operator we solved Faddeev-like Eq. (2) for the state |Ũ > at three
energies of the incoming photons: Eγ = 15, 20, and 30 MeV, using our standard approach
based on momentum space partial wave decomposition [13, 37, 40, 41]. The high precision
(semi)phenomenological nucleon-nucleon potential AV18 [35] together with the Urbana IX
[36] three-nucleon force was used. Including this 3N force reproduces the experimental 3 He
binding energy. The AV18 potential contains electromagnetic parts [35]. They are all kept in
our treatment of the 3 He bound state [42] but for the 3N continuum we keep only the strong
forces. We solve the set of coupled integral equations in the two Jacobi variables by iteration,
generating the multiple scattering series separately for each ﬁxed total 3N system angular
momentum J and parity. We neglect the coupling of states with total isospin T =
8

1
2

and

T = 32 , which is due to charge independence breaking for neutron-proton (np) and protonproton (pp) forces but keep both isospins T. The diﬀerence between pp and np forces is,
however, taken into account by applying the “ 23 − 13 ” rule [43, 44].
The single nucleon current was augmented by explicit π- and ρ-like two-body currents
which fulﬁll the current continuity equation together with the corresponding parts of the
AV18 potential [37]. As an alternative to explicit two-body contributions we employed the
Siegert theorem [37], which induces many-body contributions to the current operator.
In Figs. 1-3 we show results for two-body photodisintegration of 3 He. As shown in
~ →

and photon analyzing power Aγx show

only small sensitivity to the treatment of the two-body contributions to the current operator,
and predictions obtained with meson exchanges and Siegert theorem are close to each other.
Changing the photon energy from Eγ = 15 MeV to 30 MeV diminishes the cross section by
a factor of ≈ 3. The analyzing power Aγx is, especially at the lower energy Eγ = 15 MeV,
large and approaches a value close to 1 in a wide range of proton angles. The 3 He analyzing
3

power AyHe reaches at Eγ = 30 MeV the value of ≈ 0.2 and reveals at both energies a similar
and large sensitivity to the current operator.

by a ﬁnal state interaction in the state 1 S0 of the undetected proton-neutron pair. The
cross section drops with increasing photon energy, being reduced by a factor of ≈ 4 when

photon analyzing power Aγx shows only small sensitivity to the current, contrary to the spin

correlation coeﬃcients, which exhibit, with exceptions of Cx,y
and Cy,x
at Eγ =15 MeV,

quite large diﬀerences along the outgoing proton energy when changing the type of two-body
contributions to the current operator. For most of the presented observables that sensitivity
seems to be similar at both photons energies.
Three-body fragmentation of 3 He caused by the interaction with incoming photon oﬀers
a unique possibility to reach a speciﬁc kinematically complete geometries of three outgoing
nucleons identical to those populated in a kinematically complete nucleon-deuteron (Nd)
breakup. Comparison of data in such kinematically complete conﬁgurations, reached either
by pure hadronic interactions in Nd breakup or by electromagnetic and hadronic interactions
in three-body fragmentation of 3 He, would be very interesting due to unresolved problems
found for some kinematically complete measurements e.g. in the symmetric space-star (SST)
geometry [45]. Data for such geometries gained from complimentary Nd and three-body 3 He
photodisintegration and their comparison to theory could shed some light on the existing
discrepancies. In Tab. I we compare the incoming photon laboratory energy Eγ of the 3 He
photodisintegration with the laboratory kinetic energy E lab of the incoming nucleon in the
corresponding proton-induced deuteron breakup reaction, both processes having the same
3N system center-of-mass kinetic energy E c.m. .
The kinematically complete geometries of three outgoing nucleons can be deﬁned for
three-body photodisintegration of 3 He analogously to their Nd breakup counterparts. For
example for the ﬁnal state conﬁguration (FSI) the condition is the equality of momenta of
two interacting nucleons in the ﬁnal scattering state. For the SST three outgoing nucleons
must move in their c.m. system with equal momentum magnitudes in a plane perpendicular
to the incoming photon momentum and the relative angle between momenta is 120◦ like in
the “Mercedes star” logo.
In the case of the ﬁnal state interaction the condition of momentum equality of two nucleons permits ﬁnding, at each laboratory direction of outgoing nucleon, such a FSI geometry
in which one from remaining two nucleons have the same momentum. In Figs. 7-9 we show
~ γ , pp)n,
nonvanishing observables for exclusive three-body photodisintegration of 3 He: 3 He(~
leading to a kinematically complete ﬁnal state interaction conﬁguration in which nucleons
1 and 3 (in this case proton and neutron, respectively) have the same momenta p~1 = p~3 .

for FSI(1-3) conﬁgurations produced at angles around θ1lab ≈ 100o . Similarly to inclusive
breakup, increasing the photon energy from 15 to 30 MeV diminishes the cross section by
a factor of ≈ 2. The FSI cross section at both energies is quite sensitive to the underlying
current.

The FSI analyzing powers Aγx and AyHe show some slight sensitivity to the current operator only at the higher energy Eγ = 30 MeV. Interestingly enough, they are quite large in

large values in quite large regions of the FSI production angles.
Among numerous kinematically complete conﬁgurations of the Nd breakup reaction the
SST conﬁguration has attracted a special attention. The cross section for that geometry
is very stable with respect to the underlying dynamics and dominated by the S-waves [45].
At low energies theoretical predictions deviate signiﬁcantly from the available SST data
[46–48]. The possibility to reach that geometry through 3 He three-body photodisintegration
3

He(γ,pp)n would help to shed some light on this problem.
In Fig. 10 we show the SST cross section

the kinematically allowed events. The SST condition is exactly fulﬁlled at a central part
11

of the S-curve at each photon energy. The SST cross section observed along the S-curve
reveals only a weak sensitivity to the underlying current and the cross section drops quite
rapidly with increasing photon energy, changing from

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Recent advances in high intensity polarized photon beams and polarized 3 He targets
increased the number of observables to be measured in two- and three-body photodisintegration of 3 He. In addition to the unpolarized cross section also measurements of photon and
3

He analyzing powers as well as spin correlation coeﬃcients are feasible. That possibility to-

gether with promising results achieved in derivation, in the framework of chiral perturbation
theory, of consistent two- and three-nucleon forces as well as electro-weak currents, allows
for comprehensive testing the chiral dynamics not only in pure hadronic systems but also in
processes induced by the interaction of external electro-weak probes with nuclear systems.
Photodisintegration of polarized 3 He by polarized photon not only provides a rich choice
of observables to be measured but, due to the availability of rigorous Faddeev techniques for
solving the corresponding equations, allows one to compare such data with exact theoretical
predictions for spin-dependent observables, thus extending the testing ground for nuclear
dynamics.
We investigated the observables in two- and three-body fragmentation of 3 He with respect to their sensitivity to the underlying current by comparing results with two diﬀerent
treatments of two-body contributions, namely by taking them as direct meson exchanges or
treating them by using Siegert theorem.
For two-body fragmentation we found that the unpolarized cross section and the photon
analyzing power Aγx are practically insensitive to the underlying current. Large values of
Aγx point to the feasibility of its measurement. Both these observables would be valuable
for future testing of chiral dynamics. The sensitivity to the current operator of the 3 He
3

analyzing power AyHe and the spin correlation coeﬃcients predisposes them to test the
current operator.
For semi-inclusive three-body fragmentation we found a similar behavior. While the
unpolarized cross section and photon analyzing power Aγx show only a slight sensitivity to
12

the current, the 3 He analyzing power and spin correlation coeﬃcients reveal sensitivity to
the current practically at all the energies of the detected nucleon.
From the rich phase-space of the exclusive three-body 3 He fragmentation we investigated
only the geometry of the ﬁnal-state interaction and the symmetric space-star conﬁguration.
For FSI we found a sensitivity of the cross section to the underlying current while the
analyzing powers show only very slight sensitivity. Among spin correlation coeﬃcients the
3

γ, He
largest sensitivity is visible in Cc,x
. The sensitivity of the unpolarized SST cross section

to the underlying current gets reduced with the increasing photon energy.
~ + ~γ observables for both two- and three-body 3 He
Summarizing, measurements of 3 He
fragmentation seem feasible and such data would provide a valuable test for our understanding of electromagnetic processes, especially in the context of expected results based on chiral
dynamics. We hope this work will guide preparations of new generation precise experiments
on 3 He photodisintegration.
