Abstract. Let (X, d) be a compact metric space and f ∶ X → X be a self-map. The
compact dynamical system (X, f ) is called sensitive or sensitivity depends on initial conditions, if there is a positive constant δ such that in each non-empty open subset there are
distinct points whose iterates will be δ−apart at same instance. This dynamical property,
though being a very weak one, brings in the essence of unpredictability in the system. In
this article, we survey various sensitivities and some properties implied by and implying
such sensitivities.

1. Introduction
Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions is widely understood as being the central idea
of “chaos” and was popularized by the meteorologist Edward Lorenz through the so-called
“butterfly effect”(1963). The word “sensitive dependence on initial conditions” was first used
by D. Ruelle in 1977.
The foundational contributions to the general theory of “chaos” can be credited to Poincare,
Birkhoff, Landau, Ruelle, Takens, Lorenz, Rossler, Bowen, May, Liapunov, Sinai,
Sharkovsky and many others who have not been named here.
The systematization of the mathematical theory and many initial mathematical definitions
of “Chaos” can be credited to James Yorke [14]. Another important concept has been the
virtue of systems with every orbit dense in the space. This notion of “minimality” has had
its widest exploration by Joseph Auslander [4].
We look into the concept of “sensitivity” which largely combines the view of “chaotic sets”
due to Yorke combined with the notion of “minimality” due to Auslander.
We note here that at the same time as when Auslander and Yorke were into publishing their work on sensitivity, there was defined a parallel definition of sensitivity by John
Guckenheimer in a very restricted sense. His approach was mainly restricted to special
kind of interval maps [10]. We follow the general definition due to Auslander and
Yorke.

2. Compact Dynamical Systems
Definition 2.1. A pair (X, f ) is called a compact dynamical system, where (X, d) is a
compact metric space and f ∶ X → X is a continuous surjection.
Here O(x) = {f n (x) ∶ n ∈ N} is called the orbit of the point x.
Definition 2.2. For a system (X, f ), a point x0 ∈ X is called a fixed point if f (x0 ) = x0 .
And y0 ∈ X is called a periodic point if there exists n ∈ N such that f n (y0 ) = y0 . The
smallest such n is called the period of y0 .
Definition 2.3. The ω-limit set of a point x ∈ X under f , denoted as ω(x), is the set of
all limit points of O(x).
Definition 2.4. A point x ∈ X is said to be non-wandering if for every neighbourhood U
of x there is a n ∈ N such that f n (U) ∩ U ≠ ∅. The set of all non-wandering points of f is
denoted as Ω(f ).
Definition 2.5. For a system (X, f ), a point x ∈ X is called recurrent when x ∈ ω(x), i.
e. for every open set U containing x there exist j ∈ N such that f j (x) ∈ U. Equivalently there
is a sequence nk ↗ ∞ such that f nk (x) → x.
Definition 2.6. A subset E ⊂ X is called f -invariant if f (E) ⊆ E.
Note that ω(x) is a closed, non-empty, f -invariant set with f (ω(x)) = ω(x).
Definition 2.7. A minimal set is a non-empty closed invariant set, which contains no
proper non-empty closed invariant subsets.
Equivalently, a nonempty set M ⊂ X is minimal if, for each x ∈ M, the orbit closure
O(x) = M.
Fixed points and periodic orbits are minimal sets. Zorn’s lemma shows that in a compact
dynamical system (X, f ) any nonempty closed f -invariant subsets of X contain minimal
subsets.
Definition 2.8. A point x ∈ X is called an almost periodic point if its orbit closure O(x)
is a minimal set.
Note that an almost periodic point is always recurrent, and periodic points are always
almost periodic.
Definition 2.9. A compact system (X, f ) is called topologically transitive if for every
pair of nonempty open sets U, V in X, there is a n ∈ N such that f n (U)∩V ≠ ∅ [Equivalently,
U ∩ f −n (V ) ≠ ∅].
Proposition 2.1. For the compact system (X, f ), the following are equivalent:
( i ) (X, f ) is topologically transitive.
(ii) There is an x ∈ X with a dense orbit.
(iii) There is an x ∈ X with ω(x) = X.

RENDEZVOUS WITH SENSITIVITY

A point with a dense orbit is called a transitive point.
Note that a compact system is minimal when each of its points is a transitive point.
Definition 2.10. Let (X, f ) and (Y, g) be compact systems. A continuous surjective map
φ∶ X → Y is called a equivariant map if φ(f x) = gφ(x) for all x ∈ X.
In addition if φ is a homeomorphism, we call φ a conjugacy and say that (X, f ) and
(Y, g) are conjugate systems.
Note that
(1) If x ∈ X is a periodic point, then φ(x) is a periodic point in Y .
(2) If x ∈ X is a transitive point, then φ(x) is a transitive point in Y .
(3) If y ∈ Y is a periodic point and φ is a conjugacy then φ−1 (y) is a periodic point in X.
(4) If y ∈ Y is a transitive point and φ is a conjugacy then φ−1 (y) is a transitive point in
X.
Note that for a periodic point y ∈ Y , and an equivariant map φ∶ X → Y , φ−1 (y) need not
contain any periodic point in X. Same holds for transitive points. A simple example can be
a union of minimal systems collapsing to a point, however we can say something concrete
for almost periodic points.
Proposition 2.2. Let φ∶ X → Y be a continuous surjection where (X, f ) and (Y, g) are
compact systems. If y0 ∈ Y is almost periodic then φ−1 (y0 ) ⊂ X contains an almost periodic
point in X.
Proof. Let y0 ∈ Y is almost periodic. Then M0 = O(y0 ) ⊂ Y is minimal. φ−1 (M0 ) is a closed
nonempty f -invariant subset of X and so contains a minimal subset N0 . Now φ(N0 ) = M0
and so there exists x0 ∈ N0 such that φ(x0 ) = y0 . Thus φ−1 (y0 ) ⊂ X contains an almost
periodic point.

3. Equicontinuity and Sensitivity
Definition 3.1. Let (X, f ) be a compact dynamical system. A point x ∈ X is said to be
equicontinuous(stable) if, for any ǫ > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that d(x, x′ ) < δ implies
d(T n (x), T n (x′ )) < ǫ, for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
If all x ∈ X are equicontinuous, then the system (X, f ) is called equicontinuous.
Definition 3.2. Thus x ∈ X is sensitive(not stable / unstable) if and only if there
is a δ > 0 such that there is a sequence {xj } in X and n ∈ N such that xj → x and
d(f n (x), f n (xj )) > δ.
Equivalently, (X, f ) is sensitive at x ∈ X if there is a δ > 0 such that for any ǫ > 0 there
exists y ∈ X with d(x, y) < ǫ and n ∈ N with d(f n (x), f n (y)) > δ.
And if all x ∈ X are sensitive, then the system (X, f ) is called sensitive or sensitively
dependent on initial conditions.
Remark 3.1. Note that the uniform δ will follow due to compactness.
We note that if x ∈ X is sensitive then there will be infinitely many such n ∈ N for which
the above holds.

ANIMA NAGAR

Proposition 3.1. [5] Let (X, f ) be a compact system.
( i ) If x ∈ X is ǫ−sensitive, then every point of O(x) is ǫ/2 sensitive.
(ii) If (X, f ) is minimal and contains a sensitive point, then there is an ǫ > 0 such that
every point is ǫ−sensitive.
We note that this follows easily by triangular inequality and the fact that points in the
orbit of sensitive points are sensitive.
Remark 3.2. The above gives a nice dichotomy result - all minimal systems are either
equicontinuous or sensitive [5]. This is generally called the Auslander-Yorke dichotomy.
We look into some examples:

Example 3.1. Let X = [0, 1], the unit interval. Define f ∶ X → X as
f (x) = {

2x,
0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2;
2(1 − x), 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1.

Then for the system (X, f ), if ∣x − y∣ <
sensitive system.

then ∣f n (x) − f n (y)∣ = 2n ∣x − y∣ <

giving a

Example 3.2. Let A be a finite set and define X = AN . Equip X with product topology.
Then X is a compact metrizable space. One of the compatible metrics on X is:
1
∣ x(n) = y(n) for ∣n∣ < k}.
k+1
Define σ ∶ X → X by σ(x)(n) = x(n + 1). Then σ is a continuous self map of X - giving a
compact system (X, σ).
For any configuration x = x0 x1 x2 . . . ∈ X, and ǫ > 0 there exists a configuration y =
y0 y1 y2 . . . ∈ X such that d(x, y) < ǫ but there is an n ∈ N for which d(σ n (x), σ n (y)) > 1/2 giving a sensitive system.
d(x, y) = inf{

Example 3.3. We recall Example 3.2. Let Λ = {0, 1} and define X = ΛZ . We consider the
shift map σ ∶ X → X.
We obtain a minimal subset of X, by constructing an almost periodic point p ∈ X since
then O(p) will be minimal. We take the classical construction due to Marston Morse and
Axel Thue, giving the Morse-Thue sequence.
This construction is done using substitution: 0 → 01, 1 → 10. Hence,
0 → 01 → 0110 → 01101001 → 0110100110010110 → ⋯

This will finally converge to some x ∈ {0, 1}N . This construction indicates that every finite
x(n),
n ≥ 1;
word in x occurs syndetically often. Extend x to p ∈ X by defining p(n) = {
x(−n − 1), n < 0.
Every word in p occurs syndetically and p is symmetric at the mid point, and so p is almost
periodic. Thus (O(p), σ) is a minimal dynamical system.
It is easy to note that the system (O(p), σ) is sensitive.
Example 3.4. Let X = T = {z ∈ C ∶ ∣z∣ = 1} be the unit circle. And let g ∶ X → X be defined
as g(θ) = θ + 2πα( mod 2π), where α is an irrational number. Then g is an isometry and
(X, g) is a minimal equicontinuous system.

4. Sensitivity and Chaos
As discussed earlier, sensitivity plays an important role in “Chaos”. The (possibly)second
mathematical definition of chaos is given as,
Definition 4.1. [5][Auslander and Yorke Chaos] The compact system (X, f ) is said to
be chaotic if it is “topological transitive” and “pointwise sensitive”.
Since “pointwise sensitive” is equivalent to “sensitivity” and “topological transitivity” is
equivalent to the “existence of dense orbit”, for a compact system Auslander-Yorke Chaos
can be defined as a sensitive system with a dense orbit.
Remark 4.1. We note that this definition of Chaos makes sense even for non-compact
systems.
Historically, this definition of Chaos did not catch any attention. It was a modification
of this definition given a few years later that caught the fancy of the entire mathematical
fraternity.
Definition 4.2. [7] [Devaney Chaos] A compact system (X, f ) is called Devaney Chaotic
if:
1. (X, f ) is topologically transitive.
2. (X, f ) is sensitive.
3. (X, f ) admits a dense set of periodic points.
Thus by adding the condition of dense set of periodic points, Auslander-Yorke Chaos
became Devaney Chaos and a well accepted definition too. But all this came with a price.
Since a few years later a redundancy was reported in this definition. It was deduced that
transitivity along with the denseness of periodic orbits actually implies sensitivity, giving
a redundancy proved in [6, 18, 9] - where in [6, 18] the space is not even assumed to be
compact.
Infact, there are various conditions under which transitivity implies sensitivity. We refer
to [17] for a survey on this.
Despite this redundancy, sensitivity continues to be an integral part of chaos. Proving a
system to be sensitive is much easier than proving it to be Devaney Chaotic.
It becomes meaningful at this juncture to talk about the first mathematical definition
of Chaos given by Li and Yorke [14], which did generate a lot of excitement among the
mathematical fraternity.
Definition 4.3. For the system (X, f ), the pair (x, y) ∈ X × X is called proximal if
lim inf d(f n (x), f n (y)) = 0, asymptotic if lim d(f n (x), f n (y)) = 0, not δ−asymptotic if
n
n
lim sup d(f n (x), f n (y)) > δ, Li-Yorke if (x, y) is proximal but not asymptotic and δ−LiYorke if (x, y) is proximal but not δ−asymptotic.
n

Definition 4.4. [14] A set S ⊆ X containing at least two points is called a scrambled set
if for any x, y ∈ S with x ≠ y, the pair (x, y) is Li-Yorke.

6

ANIMA NAGAR

This means that for any two distinct x, y ∈ S, the orbits of x and y get arbitrarily close to
each other but infinitely many times they are at a positive distance.
Definition 4.5. [14] [Li-Yorke Chaos] The system (X, f ) is called Li-Yorke chaotic if
it has an uncountable scrambled set.
Later it was proved in [13] that Devaney chaos implies Li-Yorke chaos. Actually Li-Yorke
chaos follows from transitivity and the existence of just one periodic orbit.
5. Different Versions of Sensitivity

For any nonempty, open U ⊂ X for the system (X, f ) we define the seperating
times:
Nδ (U) = {n ∈ N ∶ diam(f n (U)) > δ}.
(X, f ) is sensitive if and only if there exists δ > 0 such that Nδ (U) ≠ ∅, for each
nonempty, open U ⊂ X.
Recall that S ⊆ N is called thick if for each k ∈ N there exists nk ∈ N such that {nk , nk +
1, ..., nk +k} ⊂ S, is called cofinite if it the complement of a finite set in N, is called syndetic
if there exists M ∈ N such that S ∩{n, n+1, ..., n+M} ≠ ∅ for each n ∈ N, piecewise syndetic
if it is the intersection of a syndetic set with a thick set, thickly syndetic if it has nonempty
intersection with every piecewise syndetic set and is an IP-set if it contains the finite sum
of its elements.
Stronger forms of sensitivity have been mainly studied by Christophe Abraham, Gerard Biau and Benoyt Cadre [1], Ethan Akin and Sergiy Kolyada [3], T. K. Subrahmonian
Moothathu [16], Heng Liu, Li Liao, and Lidong Wang [15], Xiangdong Ye and Tao Yu [19],
Wen Huang, Sergiy Kolyada, and Guohua Zhang [12].
Definition 5.1. The compact system (X, f ) is called
(1) strongly sensitive if there exists δ > 0 such that Nδ (U) is cofinite for any nonempty,
open U ⊂ X [1].
(2) Li-Yorke sensitive if there exists δ > 0 such that every x ∈ X is a limit of points
y ∈ X such that the pair (x, y) is proximal but not δ−asymptotic [3].
(3) thickly sensitive if there exists δ > 0 such that Nδ (U) is thick for any nonempty,
open U ⊂ X [16].
(4) syndetically sensitive if there exists δ > 0 such that Nδ (U) is syndetic for some
m ∈ N and any nonempty, open U ⊂ X [16].
(5) piecewise syndetically sensitive if there exists δ > 0 such that Nδ (U) is piecewise
syndetic for any nonempty, open U ⊂ X [11, 12, 19].
(6) thickly syndetically sensitive if there exists δ > 0 such that Nδ (U) is thickly
syndetic for any nonempty, open U ⊂ X [11, 12, 15, 19].
(7) multi-sensitive if there exists δ > 0 such that Nδ (Ui ) ≠ ∅ for any finite collection
U1 , . . . , Uk of nonempty, open subsets of X [16].

RENDEZVOUS WITH SENSITIVITY

(8) IP sensitive if there exists δ > 0 such that Nδ (U) is IP for any nonempty, open
U ⊂ X [12, 19].
Example 5.1. Recall Example 3.1. Here for any open U ⊂ [0, 1], there exists an n ∈ N such
that f n (U) = [0, 1]. Hence, it is easy to see that this system is strongly sensitive.
Example 5.2. Recall Example 3.2. Here for any pair of open U, V ⊂ X, there exists an
N ∈ N such that σ n (U) ∩ V ≠ ∅ for all n ≥ N. Thus it is easy to see that this system is thick
sensitive and multi-sensitive.
Example 5.3. Recall Example 3.3. This system is sensitive and minimal. It is easy to see
that it is syndetically sensitive.
From the definition, it follows that
cofinite sensitivity ⇒ thickly syndetical sensitivity ⇒

thick sensitivity
⇒ sensitivity.
syndetical sensitivity

and
thickly syndetical sensitivity ⇒ multi-sensitivity ⇒ thick sensitivity ⇒ sensitivity ⇐ Li-Yorke sensitivity.

We refer to [3, 12, 15, 16, 19] for more examples on different kinds of sensitivity.
Infact, more can be said
Theorem 5.1. [3] Let (X, f ) be Li–Yorke sensitive then it is sensitive. If (X, f ) is sensitive
and has a fixed point which is its unique minimal subset then it is Li–Yorke sensitive.
Theorem 5.2. [16] For interval systems and subshifts of finite type the notions of sensitivity
and strong sensitivity are equivalent.
Theorem 5.3. [12, 16] A multi-sensitive system is also thickly sensitive. Moreover if the
system is transitive, then the converse also holds.
Theorem 5.4. [19] For minimal systems the notions of thick sensitivity, thickly syndetic
sensitivity, multi-sensitivity and IP sensitivity are all equivalent.
This is also equivalent to the fact that the system is not an almost one-to-one extension
of its maximal equicontinuous factor.
Remark 5.1. Example 3.2 is thickly sensitive, thickly syndetic sensitive, multi-sensitive and
IP sensitive.
This leads to considering sensitivity for different families of subsets of Z+ .
Let P = P(Z+ ) be the collection of all subsets of Z+ . F ⊂ P is called a family if it is
hereditary upwards, i.e. if F1 ⊂ F2 and F1 ∈ F implies F2 ∈ F. A family F is proper if it is
a proper subset of P, i.e. it is neither empty nor whole of P. If a proper family F is closed
under finite intersection, then F is called a filter. We refer to [8] for more details on this.
Definition 5.2. Let F be a family. (X, f ) is F−sensitive if there is δ > 0 such that for any
nonempty, open U ⊂ X, Nδ (U) ∈ F.

8

ANIMA NAGAR

Proposition 5.1. [19] Let π ∶ (X, f ) → (Y, g) be an almost-open factor map between two
compact systems, and let F be a family. If (Y, g) is F−sensitive then so is (X, f ).
F−sensitivity for various families F have been studied in [19].
6. Auslander-Yorke Dichotomy
Recall the Auslander-Yorke dichotomy and note the following:

Proposition 6.1. [5] If the compact system (X, f ) is equicontinuous and topologically transitive, then (X, f ) is minimal, and T is a homeomorphism.
Thus topologically transitive systems if equicontinuous are minimal and the dichotomy
applies. However, not all topologically transitive systems are equicontinuous. These systems
are then non minimal. But, a very natural question can be if we can derive Auslander-Yorke
dichotomy kind of results for systems not minimal or a stronger version of such a dichotomy.

Recall that if the compact system (X, f ) is transitive but not minimal then the set of
non-transitive points is dense.
Definition 6.1. A topologically transitive system is called almost equicontinuous if there
is at least one equicontinuity point.
We note this dichotomy due to Akin, Auslander and Berg,
Proposition 6.2. [3] A transitive system is either sensitive or almost equicontinuous.
Definition 6.2. A system (X, f ) is called uniformly rigid if there exists a sequence {nk }
in N such that the sequence f nk tends uniformly to the identity map on X.
We note this dichotomy due to Glasner and Weiss,
Proposition 6.3. [9] A topologically transitive system without isolated points which is not
sensitive is uniformly rigid.
Definition 6.3. [11, 12] The point x ∈ X is called syndetically equicontinuous for the
system (X, f ), if there exists a neighborhood U ∋ x such that {n ∈ N ∶ {f n } is equicontinuous
at x} is a syndetic set.
Note that the set of syndetically equicontinuous points for (X, f ) is a superset of the set of
equicontinuity points of (X, f ) and that if (X, f ) is thickly sensitive then it cannot contain
any syndetically equicontinuous points.

Definition 6.4. [11, 12] The system (X, f ) is syndetically equicontinuous if every x ∈ X
is syndetically equicontinuous.

Example 6.1. Recall Example 3.4. This system is equicontinuous and minimal. It is easy
to see that it is syndetically equicontinuous.

Proposition 6.4. [11, 12] If (X, f ) is an almost one-to-one extension of a minimal equicontinuous system, then it is syndetically equicontinuous.

Proposition 6.5. [12] Let π ∶ (X, f ) → (Y, g) be an almost one-to-one factor map between
minimal systems. Then (X, f ) is syndetically equicontinuous if and only if (Y, g) is also.
We note this dichotomy due to Huang, Kolyada and Zhang,

Theorem 6.1. [12] Let (X, f ) be a transitive system. Then either (X, f ) is thickly sensitive,
or every transitive point is syndetically equicontinuous. In particular, if (X, f ) is minimal,
then it is either thickly sensitive or syndetically equicontinuous.
Remark 6.1. Note that in the absence of transitivity the above need not hold. Refer to [12]
for a counterexample.
Some more Auslander-Yorke dichotomy type theorems are obtained in [19] involving
F−sensitivity for various families F.
The world awaits more such dichotomies!
