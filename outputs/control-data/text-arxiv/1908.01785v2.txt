Abstract: We describe the back-reaction of gaugino condensates in supersymmetric AdS4
Type II String Theory compactifications with fluxes. We use generalized complex geometry to capture the modification of the ten-dimensional supersymmetry equations and show
that the cosmological constant prevents the cycle wrapped by the branes with gaugino condensation from shrinking to zero size. Thus, unlike in ordinary geometric transitions in
flat space, the volume of this cycle remains finite. For D7 branes with gaugino condensation, this gives a ten-dimensional account of Kähler moduli stabilization. Furthermore, by
matching the ten-dimensional supergravity solutions near and far from the cycle wrapped
by the D7 branes, we find a relation between the size of this cycle and the cosmological
constant. This relation agrees with the supersymmetric AdS vacuum condition obtained
by KKLT using effective field theory.

Introduction

Non-perturbative contributions to a Lagrangian can typically be safely ignored in the weakly
coupled regime, as they are completely sub-leading with respect to tree-level and perturbative terms. However, whenever a given coupling is absent at the perturbative level, the nonperturbative terms are no longer a correction and can completely change the physics. This
is what happens for compactifications of type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau manifolds
with fluxes, where the fluxes do not couple to the moduli parametrizing the deformations of
the Kähler form of the manifold. This is particularly problematic since the overall volume
of the manifold is a combination of Kähler moduli (or is the Kähler modulus if there is only
one), and thus the absence of couplings implies that any volume is allowed.
Kachru, Kallosh, Linde and Trivedi (KKLT) [1] realized that non-perturbative effects,
arising either from gaugino condensation on D7-branes or from Euclidean D3-brane instantons, can give rise to the desired couplings, generating a potential that stabilizes these
moduli and giving rise to a supersymmetric AdS4 warped compactification. Furthermore,
they proposed a mechanism to uplift the negative cosmological constant of these compactifications to positive values, making them interesting for explaining the current accelerated
expansion of our Universe.
In the KKLT proposal, the important physics happens at three well-separated scales,
which allows one to split the construction into three steps. Each step addresses one concrete
physical phenomenon while using an effective field theory that captures the main features
of the previous step:
• The starting point is a Type IIB solution à la Giddings-Kachru-Polchinski [2, 3],
with imaginary self-dual 3-form fluxes on an conformally-Calabi-Yau internal manifold
and a vanishing four-dimensional cosmological constant. At this stage, the complex
structure moduli and the dilaton get fixed by the 3-form fluxes. However, this kind
of no-scale compactification leaves the Kähler moduli unfixed.

–1–

• One then includes non-perturbative (NP) effects, coming either from gaugino condensation on D7-branes or from Euclidean D3-branes instantons wrapping four-cycles
of the internal manifold. Such effects generate a NP contribution to the 4D superpotential that depends on the Kähler moduli, and in the effective field theory for
these moduli one finds a supersymmetric AdS4 solution whose negative cosmological
constant comes from the non-zero on-shell value of the superpotential, W 1 .
• One finally adds a small number of anti D3-branes at the tip of a long warped throat.
These must be located far from the D7-branes, and the redshift is argued to guarantee
a negligible effect on bulk physics, providing control on the backreaction on moduli
stabilization2 . These break supersymmetry and induce an energy contribution suitable for uplifting the cosmological constant to values even above zero. In principle,
this has the advantage of producing a parametrically small Λ.
Although very appealing, up to date there is an on-going debate on whether this proposal is consistent. While the first step is well understood3 , it is not clear if the other two
steps involved in this construction stand on firm ground. In this paper we focus on the first
and second steps, making only some brief comments on the third one.
While the first step is done at the 10D level, to account for NP effects one needs to resort
to an effective 4D theory. Integrating out the complex-structure moduli and dilaton which
are supposed to be fixed at a higher energy4 , one gets a non-perturbative superpotential for
the Kähler moduli, whose imaginary parts are the volumes of 4-cycles. This is based on the
relation of these moduli with the (imaginary part of the holomorphic) gauge coupling on
−2
= g1s σ, where σ is the size of the 4-cycle in string units. If the chiral
the D7-branes, 4πgYM
fields on the D7-branes are massive, the low-energy physics on the world-volume theory, as
seen from four-dimensions, is described by a pure N = 1 Super Yang-Mills theory, which
undergoes gaugino condensation. The associated non-perturbative superpotential and the
strength of the condensate are related to σ = Im T by
WNP ∼ hλλi = A exp (iaT ) ,

(1.1)

Another proposal to stabilize Kähler moduli is to use NP effects together with the first α0 correction
[4]. Unlike in KKLT, this mechanism leads to non-supersymmetric AdS vacua. In this paper we use the
supersymmetry conditions and stay at leading order in α0 , so we do not consider this type of vacua.
2
In this paper we restrict ourselves to supersymmetric configurations. Nevertheless, there have been
concerns regarding the uplifting mechanism [5–10]. Moreover, the difficulties in obtaining solutions with a
positive cosmological constant have led to the conjecture that all de Sitter constructions in string theory
that can be described using effective field theory are not stable. This is known as the de Sitter Swampland
Conjecture [11].
3
Though already at the first step, there are questions regarding the validity of the supersymmetrybreaking Minkowski solution with non-zero W [12].
4
The use of effective field theory including warped modes was recently shown to be much more subtle than
it appears, as the complex-structure modulus corresponding to the size of the S 3 has also an exponentially
small mass [10, 13].

tions with a single Kähler modulus (and hence a single NP term), the Kähler potential is
K(T ) = −3 log(−i(T − T̄ )) = −3 log(2σ). The non-perturbative effect balances against
some classical and, in principle, tunable contribution W0 coming from the fluxes, leading
to the following F-term condition on the supersymmetric solution7 :

(1.2)

When the non-perturbative effects come from Euclidean D3-branes wrapping the same 4cycle Σ4 , the analogous F-term condition is obtained by replacing ND7 → 1 [14].
Even if this second step involves reasonably well-known ingredients in string theory, the
existence and main features of the supersymmetric vacuum solution were obtained using
4D supergravity. This raises the question of whether the effective field theory approach
captures the relevant physics (namely, the vacuum solution as well as its deformations), or
if the higher dimensional analysis may reveal new features of the compatification that the
effective field theory misses. In particular, the inclusion of NP effects leads to a small 4D
(negative) cosmological constant, resulting in an AdS scale much larger than the KK scale,
a feature that has recently been conjectured not to be possible in the landscape [9, 15].
On the other hand, the AdS background is the seed solution to ultimately obtain de Sitter
compactifications, and in this process the NP effects are key in evading classical no-go
theorems [16, 17]. Recent results revealed that in order to properly address whether the
KKLT uplifting mechanism can work or not using a Maldacena-Núñez-like approach, it is
crucial to understand what is the effect of NP physics on the geometry [8, 9, 18–22].
With all these motivations in mind, our purpose is to present the main features of the
supersymmetric AdS vacuum and the non-perturbative effects that give rise to it, directly
in the ten-dimensional geometry. Let us first comment on some crucial issues: first, it is not
clear that gaugino condensation actually happens when the extended part of the D7 brane
worldvolume is not flat. Here we will assume it does, without studying the whole dynamical
process leading to the condensate developing a vev8 . A second non-trivial issue is whether
these effects can be captured by ten-dimensional supergravity. Based on previous work,
and on the results of this paper, we will argue they can. Hence, the main questions about
the 10D description of the supersymmetric N = 1 AdS4 vacua are:
• How do we include the NP effects in the 10D supersymmetry conditions?
5

More precisely, A depends on the complex-structure and open-string moduli, but at this stage these
are taken to be fixed.
6
The functional dependence of this constant is different for other gauge groups, such as SO/U Sp (which
arise when the branes are on top of orientifold planes).
7
Note that W0 has to be very small in order to compete with the NP effect and stabilize the Kähler
modulus. This smallness and the exponential dependence of the NP effect on the modulus lead to a large
cycle size, which allows one to control higher-order NP corrections. Nevertheless, it is still not clear that
the fluxes can be tuned to make W0 so small.
8
Alternatively, we could consider NP contributions sourced by Euclidean D3-brane instantons wrapped
on the internal space.

• How do these effects back-react on the internal geometry and fluxes?
The first step towards answering the first of these questions was beautifully addressed
by Koerber and Martucci in [23, 24], using the framework of Generalized Complex Geometry
(GCG; for a review, see [25]), which we shall use. They first showed (see also [26]) that the
conditions for N = 1 supersymmetry (in the absence of condensates) [27] are equivalent to
the F- and D-flatness conditions for the 10D off-shell superpotential [28–30] that generalizes
the Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential [31] for 3-form fluxes on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Then
they were able to identify how some of these conditions are modified in the presence of nonperturbative contributions from space-filling D7 branes wrapping four-cycles on the internal
manifold. One of the most important observations is that the back-reaction modifies the
structure of the manifold. Thus, even if one started from a flux compactification on a CalabiYau manifold, or more generally on a manifold of SU(3) structure (but not necessarily of
SU(3) holonomy), the gaugino condensate on the D7 branes deforms the structure into a
more general (pair of) generalized complex structures.
The second question was studied later in several papers, from different points of view.
A computation of the first-order back-reaction felt by probe D3-branes was presented in
[32] in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, giving a geometrization of the nonperturbative effects in terms of imaginary anti-self-dual (IASD) fluxes. These fluxes were
proposed to be sourced via a coupling (first studied by [33] for other purposes) in the
fermionic D7-brane action between the gaugino mass term and the IASD fluxes. A more
precise analysis of the back-reaction was later performed in [34] for a non-compact transverse
manifold. Finally, a detailed study of one particular example was carried out in [35], which
proposed to use a dynamic SU (2) structure to characterize the generalized deformation.
This paper has three purposes. The first is to connect the approaches above. The second
is to find the 10D mechanism by which the Kähler moduli are stabilized. We show that
in the presence of a 4D cosmological constant, one of the supersymmetry equations, (3.5),
implies that the four-cycle wrapped by D7 branes with a non-trivial gaugino condensate
cannot collapse. Hence these D7 branes do not undergo the usual geometric transition. The
third purpose is to use this 10D description to obtain a relation between the parameters
of the vacuum solution and see if it can match the EFT results. We find that the size of
the four-cycle is determined by matching the solution near the D7 branes (in the region
where the non-perturbative effects sourced by the gaugino condensate dominate over the 4D
cosmological constant), and the solution far from them (where the cosmological constant
dominates). This gives us equation (4.24), which confirms the validity of the KKLT relation
(1.2) obtained using four-dimensional EFT.
As we will explain in section 3, our results also imply that a 4D cosmological constant
is incompatible with D5-brane Killing spinors, even in the presence of non-perturbative
effects. In particular, backgrounds that contain geometrically-transitioned D5 branes and
have D5 brane Killing spinors, such as the Maldacena-Núñez throat [36, 37] or the BaryonicBranch throat [38] cannot be part of a supersymmetric AdS compactification. Note that
this is a local constraint, and hence it is much more powerful than the global arguments
that have been used in the past against the presence of baryonic-branch throats in flux

compactifications.
The paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section 2 by very briefly reviewing
compactifications in the language of GCG, including some simple examples. In Section 3
we review previous results on the 10 dimensional description of non perturbative effects in
the framework of GCG, and combine them to show how moduli stabilization happens from
a 10D point of view. Then, in Section 4 we focus on the solution in [35] and describe how the
matching of the near- and far-brane behaviors determines the 10D equation governing the
volume stabilization and the vacuum KKLT solution. Finally, we discuss the consequences
of our results and the possibilities for future lines of work in Section 5.

Generalized geometry language for type II compactifications

Consider type II superstring theory on a warped product of a four-dimensional Mink4 or
AdS4 manifold, and a compact internal six-dimensional manifold M6 :
ds210 = e2A(y) gµν (x)dxµ dxν + hmn (y)dy m dy n ,

(2.1)

where xµ , µ = 0, ..3 are coordinates on Mink4 or AdS4 , and y m , m = 1, ..6 are coordinates
on M6 . The most general 10D Majorana-Weyl supersymmetry spinors of solutions that
preserve N = 1 supersymmetry in four dimensions split as

type IIB string theory, some results apply equally well to type IIA compactifications, so
we will use conventions in which the upper (lower) sign corresponds to type IIA (IIB). The
four-dimensional spinors satisfy

with µ the value of the on-shell superpotential, such that the 4D cosmological constant is

Λ = −3|µ|2 . The internal spinors η+
Using these spinors one can build two polyforms or pure spinors which characterize the

These spinors define an SU (3) × SU (3) ⊂ Spin(6, 6) structure, and contain all the information about the internal metric.
We introduce for later use the Mukai pairing, which is the form version of the inner
product between Spin(6,6) spinors

Ψ2 = Ψ±

(2.7)

and we have used the H-twisted exterior derivative dH ≡ d + H3 ∧. Of course, for µ nonzero (2.6b) is a consequence of (2.6a). For µ = 0 the first two of these equations are
twisted integrability conditions. Once an internal generalized geometry satisfying these
equations is specified, one can use the last equation to fix the RR fluxes necessary to build
a consistent supersymmetric ten-dimensional supergravity background. The equations of
motion (EOMs) of these fluxes are automatic, but one still has to impose by hand the EOM
of the NSNS flux H3 and all the Bianchi identities; the latter can be written schematically
as
dH F = sources .
(2.8)
We quickly review the familiar type IIB compactifications on SU (3) structure manifolds
with µ = 0. These only have one well-defined spinor on the internal space and therefore
the two spinors on the decomposition of 10D supersymmetry parameters differ at most by
2 = −ieiθ η 1 , such that θ = 0 for D3/D7-type supersymmetry,
a relative phase. We take η+
+
while θ = π/2 for D5-type supersymmetry. The pure spinors are
Ψ2 = Ψ− = ie−iθ Ω , Ψ1 = Ψ+ = e−iθ exp(−iJ),

(2.9)

where J and Ω are the real (1,1)-form and holomorphic (3,0) form defining the SU(3)
structure. For D3/D7-type supersymmetry, θ = 0, and the conditions (2.6b), (2.6a) imply respectively that e2A−φ J (the 2-form in Im Ψ1 ) and e3A−φ Ω are closed. For constant
dilaton9 , these imply that the metric e2A hmn is Calabi-Yau. Eq. (2.6c), the six-form in
(2.6a) and the five-form in (2.6b) say respectively that e−φ H3 = − ∗6 F3 , H3 ∧ Ω = 0 and
J ∧ H3 = 0. Equivalently, the complex 3-form flux
G3 ≡ F3 + ie−φ H3

(2.10)

is imaginary self-dual (ISD), primitive and has no (0,3) component (in other words, it is
(2,1)). The one-form component of (2.6c) relates the warp factor and F5 by d(4A − φ) =
eφ ∗6 F5 . For backgrounds with calibrated D5-branes θ = π/2 and the real and imaginary
parts of Ψ1 get switched, which implies, among other things, that F3 is related to dJ
(instead of H3 ) through an ISD condition (we expand on this later, in (4.26))
The equations impose the axion-dilaton τ ≡ C0 + ie−φ to be holomorphic, allowing for D7-brane
configurations. Constant dilaton is a particular subcase.

In type IIA, with the supersymmetry of D6-branes, one sees that the two pure spinors
exchange roles. This is nothing but the mirror-symmetric picture of the type IIB construction.
We will see that SU (3) structure is too restrictive to account for the back-reaction
of D7-branes with gaugino condensates, where the angle between the two supersymmetry
spinors depends on the distance to the brane (this is not the phase of spinors of solutions
with an SU(3)-structure, but an angle between the two well defined spinors of these more
general solutions). In terms of a structure group on the internal manifold, this is called
“dynamic SU(2) structure” (as opposed to a “rigid SU(2)” where the two spinors are always
orthogonal); however, as a structure group on the tangent bundle it is not well defined since
the spinors become parallel at some points, this SU (2) structure is not globally defined.
This is where GCG comes at play: all of these structures become the same from the point
of view of the generalized tangent bundle, they are all SU (3) × SU (3) structures, fully
encoded in the pure spinors Ψ+ , Ψ− in (2.4). We will come back to this point in section
4, where we will give the polyform expression for the pure spinors for a dynamic SU(2)
structure.
Ten-dimensional perspective
One can show that eqs. (2.6) can be derived from a superpotential. Going back to the
CY example, we know that some of these equations, more precisely those related with the
3-form flux G3 in (2.10), can be understood by looking at the Gukov-Vafa-Witten (GVW)
superpotential [31] (we work with ls = 1)

which was obtained by studying domain-wall tensions in the four-dimensional effective
theory. In this truncated effective theory the fluctuations only include the massless modes
on the CY, and there is no warping. Thus, this is not suited for deriving the complete ten
dimensional supersymmetry conditions in more general compactifications.
This puzzle was beautifully solved in a series of papers [23, 24, 28–30]. Keeping in mind

Note that in the last equality in (2.13) we switched from the twisted exterior derivative to the ordinary
one, and twisted the pure spinors instead by eB . Both formulations are equivalent but the latter is necessary
to define the proper holomorphic fields which include the B-field.

–7–

Given this superpotential, Refs [23, 24] and [26] showed that the F-flatness and Dflatness conditions amount to the full supersymmetry conditions (2.6). For that, one has to
perform a dimensional reduction, using the (string-frame) metric Ansatz (2.1). Crucially,
the reduction is done without the need to specify a particular set of modes to expand the
fields into (such as the harmonic forms used in CY compactifications). The first supersymmetry equation, (2.6a), which is the one we will focus on, was shown to be equivalent to the
F-flatness condition for the modulus T . This is not hard to see for µ = 0, by integrating
W10D in (2.13) by parts. When the cosmological constant is not zero, one has to take the
covariant derivative of the superpotential, and the extra term of this covariant derivative
(involving the superpotential times the derivative of the Kähler potential) gives precisely
the right-hand side of (2.6a).

Gaugino condensation

As discussed in the introduction, one of the necessary ingredients of the KKLT proposal
is the inclusion of NP effects. We want to see how to include the NP effects in the supersymmetry conditions, and how they backreact on the internal geometry and fluxes. We
concentrate on the situation where the NP contribution is coming from gaugino condensation induced by strong-coupling physics of the N = 1 SYM theory on ND7 > 1 space-time
filling D7-branes wrapping an internal four-cycle Σ4 .
Before trying to answer this question, let us make a few remarks. First, if one wants M6
to be compact it is mandatory to ensure that all p-form charges add-up to zero. This implies
that one must also have O7-planes in the background. In what follows, we do not need to
assume anything about the location of O7-planes, they could be on top of the D7-branes
(changing the gauge group from SU (ND7 ) to SO(2ND7 )) or further apart. Second, it is
important to recall that supersymmetry forces Σ4 to be a generalized calibrated manifold11
[39, 40]. In the absence of world-volume fluxes F and for a Calabi-Yau manifold (or, more
generally, a manifold with an SU(3) structure) this implies that Σ4 has to be a complex
sub-manifold, whose volume form is given by 1/2 J 2 |Σ4 .
For more general solutions (with an SU(3)×SU(3) structure and/or world-volume fluxes),
the (algebraic part of the) calibration condition for a supersymmetric space-filling Dp-brane
in a type II vacuum can be written in the GCG language as the algebraic condition12
e4A−φ

p

det [(g + B)|Σ + F]dξ 1 ∧ ...dξ p−3 = e4A−φ Re Ψ1 |Σ ∧ eF |p−3

(3.1)

where ξ are the world-volume coordinates. It can be seen [39, 41] that the differential condition leading to the volume minimization of the cycle is nothing else but the supersymmetry
equation (2.6c). Interestingly, the rest of the conditions (2.6) can also be interpreted in a
similar way. Indeed, e3A−φ Ψ2 and e2A−φ Im Ψ1 constitute the calibration forms corresponding to domain walls and string-like objects, respectively.

An analogous statement can be derived for Euclidean branes wrapping Σ, see Appendix D of [23] or
[24].

Going back to the condensate, we need to calculate how its presence affects the geometry
and the fluxes. In particular, it is crucial to understand the modifications it induces on the
supersymmetry conditions (2.6). Here we follow an instructive argument presented in [34].
We are looking for the modification of the 10D supersymmetry equations associated to the
NP contribution (1.1) in the superpotential13 . As described above, this term depends on
the gauge coupling that in the 10D picture is given by the volume of the 4-cycle Σ, hence
the dependence of (1.1) on the imaginary part of the Kähler modulus T . The F 2 part of
the DBI action for the Dp-branes is

from where we one can read off the effective SYM coupling constant. Furthermore, we can
easily guess the holomorphic completion of this coupling: e−φ Re Ψ1 will be replaced by the
(untwisted) variable T defined in (2.14). Indeed, the effective SYM θ term comes from the
Wess-Zumino term in SDp , where the world-volume fluxes are coupled to the RR potentials.
Finally, note that if we define δ 9−p [Σ] as the (9 − p)-form Poincaré dual to the (p − 3)-cycle

with δα9−p [Σ] ≡ α(δ 9−p [Σ]) and α defined in (2.5). We are now ready to present how the
non-perturbative effects modify the first supersymmetry equation (2.6a) which, we recall,
is equivalent to the F-flatness condition for the modulus T . Taking the covariant variation
of the full superpotential (namely the sum of the non-perturbative piece (1.1) and the
perturbative one (2.13)) with respect to the 10D holomorphic variable T one concludes
that (2.6a) gets an additional non-perturbative term. The exponential dependence of the
NP term on T makes this new 10D contribution proportional to the 4D vev. Moreover,
since the gauge kinetic function (3.4) is localized, this new term is localized. Hence, the
quantum corrected version of (2.6a) is

Finally, µ is still related to the on-shell value of the superpotential, which is also modified
in order to include the NP term: W10D → W10D + WNP .

This contribution can be computed explicitly in Heterotic theory, where the four-fermion terms in the
10D action are known. Intriguingly, it was found in [42] that there is no fermion bilinear contribution to
the 4d superpotential. Here we follow KKLT and assume that such a contribution does exist. It would be
interesting to understand the relation between the Heterotic and the Type II results.

Interpretation
Now that we know how (2.6a) is modified, we would like to understand its implications,
focusing on some examples. We are interested in the local features of the geometry driven by
the new term in (3.5), so we will leave aside extra constraints arising in compactifications,
such as tadpole cancellation, and make our conclusions based on results obtained in noncompact geometries.
For µ = 0, equation (3.5) implies that dH Z ∼ hSiδ 9−p [Σ]. This has a very simple
geometrical interpretation [43, 44]: it tells us that δ 9−p [Σ] is trivial in the cohomological
sense14 . Stokes’ theorem then implies that integrating any closed (p − 3)−form on Σ will
give zero. In other words, the cycle itself shrinks and becomes trivial in homology. This is
familiar in the context of geometric transitions. For example, for D5 branes wrapping the
holomorphic 2-cycle of at the tip of a resolved conifold, (3.5) implies that dΩ3 ∼ hSiδ 4 [Σ2 ].
The strong-coupling dynamics make Σ2 shrink, while the 3-cycle blows up and becomes
topologically non-trivial, regularizing the geometry into a deformed conifold. The D5branes disappear and the final solution has no localized sources. Furthermore, it can still
be described as a manifold with SU (3)-structure. By using the AdS/CFT correspondence,
this transition admits a very nice interpretation from the CFT point of view: it encodes
the chiral symmetry breaking that takes place in the IR of the theory. Of course, a mirror
picture works for D6 branes, where one has15 dJ ∼ hSiδ 3 [Σ3 ]. This was first studied in [45]
(see also [46]).
Now, as emphasized in [34], the situation with D7-branes is very different from the
previous examples. First, a gauge theory dual for D7-branes wrapping holomorphic 4-cycles
is difficult to find. In particular one cannot take ND7 large. Concerning the supergravity
solution we are analyzing, there are two fundamental differences for D7-branes:
• For p = 7 the cycle Σ4 is a holomorphic 4-cycle and the localized delta function is

a 2-form. Thus, Eq.(3.5) has a term d e3A−φ Ψ2 ∼ hSiδ 2 [Σ] and so Ψ2 necessarily
contains a 1-form. As a consequence, it is impossible to satisfy the supersymmetry
condition while staying within the realm of ordinary complex geometry [34]. We are
forced to consider manifolds with more general structure groups than SU(3). The
generic structure group is the so-called dynamical SU (2) structure.
• Moreover, something very interesting happens if we consider an AdS4 compactification. For p = 7 and µ 6= 0 Eq. (3.5) takes the form


dH e3A−φ Ψ2 = 2iµe2A−φ Im Ψ1 − 2ihSiδ 2 [Σ4 ].
(3.7)
The first observation we make is that, since µ is nonzero, δ 2 [Σ4 ] is not exact anymore.
Following the logic in the above arguments, this means that the cycle wrapped by
14

Note that the differential operator is the twisted exterior derivative, and thus the dual cycles are trivial
in twisted cohomology. However, for D7-branes the right hand side is a two-form, and therefore the twisting
by H3 plays no role and the dual four-cycle would be trivial in ordinary cohomology.
15
Here Σ3 needs to be a special Lagrangian cycle for the D6-branes to be calibrated. Moreover, the H3
twist on the exterior derivative is irrelevant for us in this class of Type IIA solutions because Re Ψ2 has a
2-form component but no 0-form component.

– 10 –

the D7-branes is not trivialized anymore! The situation is different from the usual
geometric transitions. Moreover, it is consistent with the interpretation we would
like to give to this configuration in the context of the KKLT scenario. Indeed, the
stabilization of the volume modulus can be understood from (3.7) in terms of Σ4
staying at a definite, finite size16 and the presence of a negative cosmological constant
in four dimensions constitutes a necessary condition. To the best of our knowledge,
this interpretation has not been given in the literature before.
Because we were interested in local features, we decided to leave aside global constrains.
Nevertheless, note that in a global compactification, (3.5) provides a relation between the
amplitudes of all NP effects and the 4D CC in the form of a tadpole-cancellation condition.
We would also like to point out that a connection between the non-perturbatively
modified supersymmetry equation (3.7) and a would-be ten-dimensional description of the
supersymmetric AdS4 solution of [1] was attempted in [23, 24]. However, this was done by
using smeared instatons, that is, roughly speaking, by replacing the NP current δ 2 [Σ4 ] in
(3.4) by a suitably normalized two-form proportional to Im Ψ1 ∼ J, allowing the authors
to keep the original SU (3) structure. In the rest of the paper, we will pursue the same goal
without relying on any smearing process (and thus going beyond SU (3) structure).
Equation (3.5) also has intriguing implications for the geometric transition of D5 branes
in supersymmetric AdS compactifications. This equation implies that the product of µ and
the imaginary part of the zero-form component of Ψ1 is zero. For D5-brane-type Killing
spinors, this rules out AdS solutions, except for rigid SU(2) structure [47]. Our results
imply that this happens even in the presence of non-perturbative effects. In particular, this
rules out the possibility of constructing supersymmetric AdS solutions whose internal space
contains a Maldacena-Núñez throat [36, 37], or other throats with D5-brane-type Killing
spinors such as the baryonic branch [38].
Moreover, for throats with D3-type supersymmetry and NP effects on D5-branes wrapping a collapsed 2-cycle, such as [48], supersymmetry requires to keep the cycle at zero size.
For AdS compactifications, the four-form component of (3.5) implies that the only way of
keeping the 2-cycle trivial is to have an H3 flux and an SU(2) structure. The resulting
geometry would not have an SU(3) structure, so it would be different from the one in [48].

KKLT and dynamic SU (2) structure

4

In the most common N = 1 compactifications of type II string theory, the structure group
of the internal manifold is taken to be SU (3). Then there exists a single globally defined
spinor, and the geometry is characterized by J and Ω. However, according to the discussion
of the previous section, this is too restrictive when NP contributions coming from D7-branes
gaugino condensation are included.
As briefly discussed in section 2, the most general solution has a so-called dynamic
SU (2) structure determined by two chiral spinors η 1,2 , whose relative orientation is char16

Note that in order for the gauge coupling to still be large such that the gauginos get a vev it is necessary
that the cycle is stabilized at a small size.

The geometry is then characterized as a mixture between the two SU (3) structures associated to each of the spinors18 . The invariant forms are the 1-form Θ and a real and a
complex 2-form J2 and Ω2 satisfying

J2 ∧ Ω2 = Ω2 ∧ Ω2 = 0 , J2 ∧ J2 = Ω2 ∧ Ω2 , ıΘ Ω2 = ıΘ J2 = 0.

(4.2)

Schematically, we can think about this in the following way: the 2-forms play the role of
the Kähler and holomorphic forms on four-dimensional subspaces, while Θ points holomorphically in the normal direction. This appears to be perfectly suited for our goal, as we will
identify the sub-manifold corresponding to this four-dimensional subspace (at a particular
point in the normal direction) with the 4-cycle Σ4 wrapped by the D7-branes. The pure
spinors are given by19

with J1 ≡ 2i Θ ∧ Θ. In our conventions the 1-form is normalized such that h−1 (Θ, Θ̄) = 2.
We immediately see that the four-form component of Re Ψ+ has the right form to be the
calibration for Σ4 .
The P2 example
An interesting solution with this structure group was found in [35]. The solution describes
a configuration of D7-branes on top of O7-planes such that the D7 charge cancels locally.
All of them wrap the P2 on the resolution of C3 /Z3 . Here we provide the elements of their
calculations relevant for our purposes, and refer the reader interested in further details to
the original paper. The orbifold action is given by the identification
z i ∼ e2πi/3 z i ,

(4.5)

so this (non-compact) manifold can be described locally in terms of Z3 -invariant coordinates
z and u1,2 , where

In principle there could be an extra phase in (4.1) distinguishing between D3/D7 type supersymmetry
or D5 type but, as already argued, an AdS4 vacuum rules out the latter option.
18
Note that if there are points where sin ϕ = 0, the two SU(3) structures coincide at those points, and
thus one cannot define a global SU (2) structure on the tangent bundle. In that sense, the terminology
“dynamic SU(2)” structure is not the most accurate, but we stick to it as it is more intuitive than the
precise terminology: SU(3)× SU(3) ⊂ O(6, 6) structure.
19
There is a choice involved in righting down these expressions related to an SO(3) rotation in the space
of the real 2-forms {J2 , Re Ω2 , Im Ω2 } [49].

on the final geometry that contains all the desired ingredients.

The coordinate choice introduced above is particularly useful in describing the region

with a = 1, 2. Crucially, all functions depend only on r, which parametrizes the distance to

implies d(e2A−φ J2 ) = 0, or equivalently 2A − φ + 2L2 ≡ 2l2 is constant. Implementing
this in (4.11) we find that µ ≈ 0 in the vicinity of Σ4 . This means that in this region the
cosmological constant is only relevant at higher order. Thus, Eq. (4.9) (which contains the
NP contribution) is satisfied in this regime if and only if21

We do not expect this equation to get modified by the gaugino condensate, as it does not contain any
contribution related to the cosmological constant term or to the fluxes. This is consistent with the analysis
of [34].
21
This clarifies the relation between [35], where this constant was named c1 , and [34] (see also section 6.2
of [23, 24]). Indeed, c1 is seen as the on-shell value for WNP , in other words, the gaugino condensate.

The KKLT AdS vacuum from 10D solution matching
The matching condition (4.17) is a crucial relation that encodes the stabilization of moduli
from the 10D perspective. Let us consider its implications carefully.
First, recall that the volume of the wrapped cycle Σ4 is given by the (imaginary part
of the) Kähler modulus σ
Vol(Σ4 ) = σ.
(4.18)
On one hand, µ is, by definition, related to the on-shell value of the full superpotential by
µ = eK/2 WKKLT =

W0 + WNP
(2σ)3/2

(4.19)

where we have used the expression for the Kähler potential K = −3 log(2σ) and, as explained before, W0 is the flux contribution to the superpotential, given by the GCG generalization of the GVW superpotential which depends on the complex structure and axiondilaton moduli, evaluated at the minimum. Moreover, the non-perturbative superpotential
is proportional to the condensate:
WNP = Nc hSi =

2π
hSi,
a

(4.20)

where a is defined in (1.1). This expression is valid for a pure-glue gauge theory, otherwise
the overall constant would be different.
On the other hand, e2l2 is not just any integration constant: it is related to the volume
of the base of the resolved cone (the four-cycle Σ4 ). More precisely, it is easy to see that

This is the ten-dimensional equation that is necessary in order to solve the supersymmetry
condition (4.9). Up to a numerical factor, this equation agrees with the bottom-up EFT
relation that was used in the KKLT construction, (1.2), thus confirming the validity of the
latter.
To recap, equation (4.24) arises as a requirement for matching the supergravity solution in the region very close the D7-branes, where the source term hSiδ 2 [Σ4 ] dominates
over the cosmological constant contribution, with the solution in the region away from the
D7 branes, where the latter dominates over the former. The highly non-trivial matching
between the 10D calculation performed here and the EFT F-flatness condition (1.2) provides support for the validity of the supersymmetric AdS vacuum: on one hand, the EFT
appears indeed to capture the key features of the 10D physics properly and, on the other
hand, an internal manifold with dynamical SU(2) structure appears to have the correct
geometric properties to describe the supersymmetric AdS4 solution induced by fluxes and
non-perturbative contributions coming from gaugino condensates.
Further comments
• Here we focused only on a subset of the supersymmetry conditions but, of course, all
of them need to be satisfied. In [35], a solution to the full system was obtained only in
the region close to the D7-branes (but for |z| > 0), where the effect of the curvature
term can safely be ignored. The solution involves several integration constants, whose
connection with clear physical boundary conditions is hard to obtain. Furthermore,
it is worth pointing out that some issues arise when analyzing the behavior very close
to the D7-branes.

The precise expression is

In the last equality we have used the fact that, within our Ansatz, all scalar functions are constant along
the cycle.

– 15 –

• As discussed above, the angle ϕ is a function of the distance to the branes, and
the structure is of the dynamic SU (2) type. However, as one goes away from the
branes, ϕ approaches zero asymptotically. Thus, at large distances the structure is
approximately SU (3), but the presence of a small cosmological constant remains. This
indicates that the description proposed in [23, 24] in terms of smeared instantons can
capture the important physics as seen from a distant observer. Also, the fact that µ
and the deformation parameter ϕ are small far away from the region where NP effects
are large could allow for a perturbative treatment.
• It has been pointed out that the localized gaugino condensate acts as a source for
the IASD components of the 3-form flux G3 [32, 34, 35]. The existence of this flux is
related to the stabilized cycle being kept at finite size, as we now explain: we start
by recalling that in the well known Klebanov-Strassler solution [48] the allowed fluxes
are ISD. This is a consequence of (2.6c), whose 3-form component in a conformal-CY
compactification with µ = 0 is nothing else but the ISD condition
∗6 G3 = iG3

where

G3 = F3 + ie−φ H3 .

(4.25)

In an AdS compactification, µ 6= 0, and the self-duality condition no longer holds;
the solution must contain IASD fluxes whose strength is proportional to the new
contribution in (2.6c). Therefore, both the finiteness of the cycle and the presence of
IASD flux are consequences of having an AdS compactification.
We can also generalize the previous argument to more general solutions. Again, we
start from (2.6c) with µ = 0, which can be recast as an ISD condition for the more
general complex “flux” polyform [50]


∗6 G = iG , where G = F + ie−4A dH e4A−φ Re Ψ1 , ˜∗6 ≡ − ∗6 α
(4.26)
and α is defined in (2.5). Note that this equation describes the Maldacena-Núñez
[36, 37] and baryonic-branch [38] solutions. Turning on a cosmological constant,
(2.6c) is modified to
(1 + i˜∗6 )G = 3ie−A−φ µ̄Ψ2 .
(4.27)
Following the same logic, we see that the finite stabilization of cycles by NP effects
will always come together with generalized IASD fluxes G, whose amplitude is tied
to µ.
• Furthermore, note that Eq. (2.6a) might not be the only supersymmetry condition
modified by the backreaction of the localized strong-coupling effects. It is known that
RR (and NSNS) background fluxes can generically produce a mass for the gaugino
on the branes. Flipping this argument around, one finds that the gaugino condensate
should also act as a source for the fluxes [32], which would generate a new localized
contribution to (2.6c). So far, the exact form of this new term has only been worked
out for D7-branes in an SU(3)-structure background with a constant warp factor [34].
This was seen to produce an additional localized ISD piece of type (0,3) in G3 . The
general form of this new contribution in the GCG language will be addressed in detail
in a more technical companion paper [51].

Discussion

We have analyzed the backreacted geometry of NP effects, based on the quantum corrected
supersymmetry equation (3.5). We have shown that for supersymmetric AdS4 vacua with
D7-branes undergoing gaugino condensation, this equation implies that the cycle wrapped
by the branes stays at a finite size, in contrast with the usual geometric transition that takes
place in Minkowski space. Our approach should be applicable to any AdS compactification
involving stacks of Dp-branes undergoing gaugino condensation.
This is the ten dimensional description of Kähler moduli stabilization in type IIB string
compactifications à la KKLT. Furthermore, this works at the quantitative level. Indeed, we
have found that the matching of the supergravity solution near the D7-branes (where the
fields sourced by the gaugino condensate, found from equation (3.7), are stronger than the
cosmological constant) with the solution far from these branes produces a relation, (4.24),
between the size of the four-cycle and the cosmological constant. This top-down result
matches the bottom-up relation obtained by an EFT analysis in [1].
All our analysis is based on the supersymmetry equation (3.5). It is worth pointing
out that [34] argued that the third susy equation (2.6c) should be modified as well by the
addition of a localized term. We leave the full set of modified equations, as well as a more
detailed analysis of the background, for a future publication.
Note that in this paper we have only matched certain limits of the full solution describing D7 branes with gaugino condensation. It would be very interesting to find the full
solution. In particular, it would help to understand whether the naked singularity close
to the D7-branes found in [35] is unavoidable and, if so, how it can be resolved in string
theory.
One of our assumptions has been that D7-brane gaugino condensation happens and
that it gives rise to a supersymmetric AdS4 vacuum. It would be very interesting to obtain
a deeper field-theoretical understanding of this process, and establish whether and under
what circumstances this happens when the worldvolume of the D7 branes has an AdS4
factor.
Our top-down result matches the main features of the KKLT AdS vacuum obtained
from the effective field theory of the Kähler moduli. However, this does not necessarily mean
that this effective field theory is the appropriate one, and/or whether there are missing light
modes, as suggested both by swampland arguments [15], and by an explicit computation
of the Laplacian in the warped throat [13]. Furthermore, taking into account the warp
factor in the EFT for the complex structure moduli was shown to lead to a potential with
a very different behavior than the constant-warp-factor potential [10]. The minima of the
two potentials are the same, but their behaviors near the origin are completely different. In
particular, the naive constant-warp-factor potential fails to capture the runaway behavior
that is produced by the addition of anti-D3-branes.
Furthermore, as highlighted in [8, 9, 18–22], any attempt to uplift the cosmological
constant via the inclusion of some localized objects (such as anti-D3 branes) is highly
dependent on the details of the gaugino condensation. Now that we understand (albeit by
patches) the features of the 10D solution sourced by D7 branes with a condensate, it would

– 17 –

be very interesting to construct a more general 10D geometry (and possibly an effective 4D
EFT) where one takes into account also the effects of the anti-D3 branes.
We also argued that the AdS4 supersymmetry equations rule out D5-brane-type supersymmetry (except for rigid SU(2) structure), even in the presence of non-perturbative
effects. As we have explained, this rules out supersymmetric AdS compactifications with
Maldacena-Núñez or baryonic-branch throats. Throats with D3-brane-type supersymmetry, instead, can be embedded in AdS compactifications only if the D5-brane developing a
gaugino condensate wraps a collapsed cycle. This can only be achieved if the internal manifold has SU(2) structure, so solutions such as the Klebanov-Strassler throat would have to
be modified into a manifold with this structure group.
We would also like to stress that the procedure we used to match the near- and far-D7
brane regions and to obtain the 10D version of moduli stabilization appears to be more
general and can also be applied to other D-branes wrapping calibrated cycles. For type
IIB compactifications the only such branes are D5 branes wrapping two-cycles but, as we
have seen above, these are already ruled out in AdS compactifications. However, in type
IIA compactifications our procedure could in principle be used to study the backreaction of
D-branes with gaugino condensation and to obtain similar top-down equations governing
the moduli of supersymmetric AdS vacua.
