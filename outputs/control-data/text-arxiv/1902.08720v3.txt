INNER HORNS FOR 2-QUASI-CATEGORIES
YUKI MAEHARA
Abstract. Dimitri Ara’s 2-quasi-categories, which are certain presheaves over
André Joyal’s 2-cell category Θ2 , are an example of a concrete model that
realises the abstract notion of (∞, 2)-category. In this paper, we prove that
the 2-quasi-categories and the fibrations into them can be characterised using
the inner horn inclusions and the equivalence extensions introduced by David
Oury. These maps are more tractable than the maps that Ara originally used
and therefore our result can serve as a combinatorial foundation for the study
of 2-quasi-categories.

1. Introduction
There are several different models for (∞, 1)-categories, e.g. quasi-categories,
complete Segal spaces, simplicial categories, etc. Amongst these the most prominent
is the presentation of (∞, 1)-categories as quasi-categories. In addition to their
being the most economical model among the geometric ones, many authors, most
notably André Joyal [7, 8] and Jacob Lurie [11, 10], have shown that one can “do
category theory” in quasi-categories. In a similar vein, our ultimate goal is to “do
2-category theory” in 2-quasi-categories.
As their name suggests, 2-quasi-categories are an (∞, 2)-analogue to the (∞, 1)notion of quasi-categories. In [1], Dimitri Ara constructed for each n ≥ 1 a model
cn which presents (∞, n)-categories. The n-quasi-categories are the
structure on Θ
cn with respect to this structure. In the case n = 1 Ara’s
fibrant objects in Θ
model structure coincides with Joyal’s. The fibrant objects of the case n = 2, the
2-quasi-categories, are the subject of this work.
We originally wanted to understand the Θ2 -version of the (lax ) Gray tensor
product, and the main result of this paper was developed as a combinatorial tool
for proving that tensor product to be left Quillen (which will be done in a future
paper). In [1], Ara characterised not only the 2-quasi-categories, but also the
fibrations into them. More precisely, he proved them to be exactly those maps with
the right lifting property with respect to a set JA of monomorphisms. Thus to
prove the tensor product is left Quillen, it would suffice to check that it interacts
nicely with the maps in JA . However, the definition of JA is complicated and not
very easy to deal with. The purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative set
which is combinatorially more tractable.
More specifically, we show the set JO of inner horn inclusions and equivalence
extensions, introduced by David Oury in his PhD thesis [12], can be used in place
of JA . These maps are constructed from their simplicial counterparts using the
2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 18G55, 55U35, 55U40; Secondary 18D05,

precise construction and other background material will be reviewed in Section 2.
The most technical (and also the longest) section of this paper is Section 3
where we compare the sets JA and JO and the class of trivial cofibrations. In
Section 4 we consider a different notion of inner horn, namely the sub-Θ2 -sets
of the representables generated by all but one codimension-one faces. Section 5 is
very short and devoted to proving that the infinite family of horizontal equivalences
(contained in both JA and JO ) can in fact be replaced by a single map as long as we
keep the inner horn inclusions in the defining set of monomorphisms. In Section 6
we prove the main theorem of the work (Theorem 6.1). Section 7 illustrates how
this theorem will be used in our future paper to prove that the Gray tensor product
is left Quillen.
2. Background
2.1. Simplicial sets and shuffles. As usual, we denote by ∆ the category of nondef
empty finite ordinals [n] = {0, . . . , n} and order-preserving maps. The morphisms
in ∆ will be called simplicial operators. We often denote a simplicial operator
α : [m] → [n] by its “image” {α(0), . . . , α(m)}; e.g. {0, 2} = δ 1 : [1] → [2] is the 1st
elementary face operator.
b for the category [∆op , Set] of simplicial sets, and write ∆[n] for
We will write ∆
b is a simplicial set, x ∈ Xn and
the presheaf represented by [n] ∈ ∆. If X ∈ ∆
α : [m] → [n] is a simplicial operator, then we will write x · α for the image of x
under X(α).
Definition 2.1. An (m, n)-shuffle is a non-degenerate (m + n)-simplex in the
product ∆[m] × ∆[n].
Equivalently, an (m, n)-shuffle hα, α′ i consists of two surjections
α : [m + n] → [m],
α′ : [m + n] → [n]
in ∆ such that α(i) + α′ (i) = i for all i ∈ [m + n]. We write Shfl(m, n) for the set
of (m, n)-shuffles. Note that an (m, n)-shuffle hα, α′ i is uniquely determined by the
surjection α : [m + n] → [m] since α′ can be recovered as α′ (i) = i − α(i). Thus
the pointwise order on ∆([m + n], [m]) induces a partial order ≤ on Shfl(m, n). We
have drawn in Fig. 1 two copies of Shfl(2, 2), where each vertex hα, α′ i is labelled
with α (left) or the corresponding grid-path (right) which we describe now.
We can visualise (m, n)-shuffles as paths on the m × n grid from the lower-left
corner to the upper-right corner. For example, the path in Fig. 2 corresponds to
the (3, 2)-shuffle h{0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3}, {0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2}i. (If either m = 0 or n = 0 then
the “grid” becomes a line segment. In this case we have a unique path connecting
the two endpoints, which corresponds to having a unique (m, n)-shuffle.) This
motivates the following notation.
Definition 2.2. Given an (m, n)-shuffle hα, α′ i, we will write:
• yhα, α′ i for the set of all 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n − 1 such that
α(i + 1) = α(i) = α(i − 1) + 1
′

(or equivalently α (i + 1) = α′ (i) + 1 = α′ (i − 1) + 1) holds; and

α(i + 1) = α(i) + 1 = α(i − 1) + 1
(or equivalently α′ (i + 1) = α′ (i) = α′ (i − 1) + 1) holds.
For example, if hα, α′ i is the (3, 2)-shuffle depicted in Fig. 2, then yhα, α′ i = {3}
and phα, α′ i = {1, 4}. The following propositions are straightforward to prove.
Proposition 2.3. Let hα, α′ i, hβ, β ′ i be (m, n)-shuffles. Suppose α(i) = β(i) (and
so α′ (i) = β ′ (i)) for each i ∈yhα, α′ i. Then hα, α′ i ≤ hβ, β ′ i.
Proposition 2.4. Let hα, α′ i be an (m, n)-shuffle and suppose i ∈yhα, α′ i. Then
hα, α′ i has an immediate predecessor hβ, β ′ i such that hα, α′ i ◦ δ i = hβ, β ′ i ◦ δ i .
Moreover, this condition determines hβ, β ′ i uniquely and induces a bijection between yhα, α′ i and the set of immediate predecessors of hα, α′ i. Similarly, there is
a bijection between phα, α′ i and the set of immediate successors of hα, α′ i.
For 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n − 1, the grid-path corresponding to hα, α′ i ∈ Shfl(m, n)
locally looks like:

This observation can be formalised as follows.
Proposition 2.5. Let hα, α′ i be an (m, n)-shuffle. Then for any 1 ≤ i ≤ m+ n− 1,
precisely one of the following holds:

hom(k, ℓ) =

if k > ℓ.
More precisely, Θ2 has objects [n; q] = [n; q1 , . . . , qn ] where n, qk ∈ N for each k.
A morphism [α; α] = [α; αα(0)+1 , . . . , αα(m) ] : [m; p] → [n; q] consists of simplicial
operators α : [m] → [n] and αk : [pℓ ] → [qk ] for each k ∈ [n] such that there exists
(necessarily unique) ℓ ∈ [m] with α(ℓ − 1) < k ≤ α(ℓ). By a cellular operator we
mean a morphism in Θ2 . Clearly [0] is a terminal object in Θ2 , and we will write
! : [n; q] → [0] for any cellular operator into [0].
Remark. Here we are describing Θ2 = ∆ ≀ ∆ as an instance of Berger’s wreath
product construction. For any given category C , the wreath product ∆ ≀ C may
be thought of as the category of free C -enriched (or more accurately Cb-enriched)
categories generated by linear C -enriched graphs. The precise definition can be
found in [3, Definition 3.1].
Remark. The notation for objects (and maps) in Θ2 varies from author to author.
(This is partly because some authors introduce a notation for objects in a general
wreath product category which can be specialised to Θ2 = ∆ ≀ ∆ while others are
interested in the particular category Θ2 and hence able to adopt a more economical
notation.) For example, the object we denote by [n; q] = [n; q1 , . . . , qn ] would be
denoted as:
• ([q1 ], . . . , [qn ]) in [3];
• [n; q] = ([n], [−1], [q1 ], . . . , [qn ], [−1]) in [12];
• ([n], [q1 ], . . . , [qn ]) in [13]; and
• hq1 , . . . , qn i in [17].
In [1] an object in Θ2 (or more generally in Θn ) is specified using the table of
dimensions; see loc. cit. for details.
The category ∆ has an automorphism (−)op which is the identity on objects and
sends α : [m] → [n] to αop : [m] → [n] given by αop (i) = n − α(m − i). This induces
two automorphisms on Θ2 , namely:

[α; αop
α(0)+1 , . . . , αα(m) ] : [m; p] → [n; q];

and
• (−)op : Θ2 → Θ2 , which sends [α; α] : [m; p] → [n; q] to
[αop ; αα(m) , . . . , αα(0)+1 ] : [m; pm , . . . , p1 ] → [n; qn , . . . , q1 ].
2.3. Face maps in Θ2 . There is a Reedy category structure on Θ2 defined as
follows; see [4, Proposition 2.11] or [2, Lemma 2.4] for a proof.
Pn

Definition 2.6. The dimension of [n; q] is dim [n; q] = n + k=1 qk . A cellular
operator [α; α] : [m; p] → [n; q] is a face operator if α is monic and {αk : α(ℓ − 1) <
k ≤ α(ℓ)} is jointly monic for each 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ m. It is a degeneracy operator if α and
all αk are surjective.
Definition 2.7. A simplicial operator α : [m] → [n] is inert if it is a subinterval
inclusion, that is, if α(i + 1) = α(i) + 1 for 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1.
Definition 2.8. We say a face map [α; α] : [m; p] → [n; q] is:
• inner if α and all αk preserve the top and bottom elements, and otherwise
outer ;
• horizontal if each αk is surjective;
• vertical if α = id; and
• inert if α and all αk are inert.
(Examples of each kind can be found in Table 1.) A horizontal face map of the
form [δ k ; α] will be called a k-th horizontal face.
By the codimension of a face map [α; α] : [m; p] → [n; q], we mean the difference
dim [n; q] − dim [m; p]. We will in particular be interested in the face maps of
codimension 1, which we call hyperfaces. Such a map [α; α] has precisely one of the
following forms:
• for n ≥ 1, [n; q] always has a unique 0-th horizontal face
def

δh0 = [δ 0 ; id] : [n − 1; q2 , . . . , qn ] → [n; q]
which has codimension 1 if and only if q1 = 0;
• similarly, if qn = 0 then the unique n-th horizontal face
def

δhn = [δ n ; id] : [n − 1; q1 , . . . , qn−1 ] → [n; q]
has codimension 1;
• for each 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, there is a family of k-th horizontal hyperfaces

Table 1. Some faces of [2; 0, 2]

Convention. Strictly speaking, we are giving the same name to different cellular
operators, and this can lead to confusion. So in the rest of this paper, we will assume
the codomain of any cellular operator denoted by δ (with some decoration) is always
whatever is called [n; q] at that point (or some cellular subset of Θ2 [n; q] as described
in Section 2.4). When this is not the case, we will indicate the codomain [m; p] either
by writing δ[m; p] instead of δ, or by drawing δ as an arrow [m′ ; p′ ]

δ

[m; p].

In Table 1, we have listed various faces of [2; 0, 2]. We will briefly describe how
to read the pictures. In the first row is the “standard picture” of [2; 0, 2], in which
we have nicely placed its objects ( ), generating 1-cells ( ) and generating 2-cells
(
). In the rest of the table, a face operator [α; α] : [m; p] → [2; 0, 2] is illustrated
as the standard picture of [m; p] appropriately distorted so that the ℓ-th object
appears in the α(ℓ)-th position and each generating 1-cell lies roughly where the
factors of its image used to. In the third row (where α1 is not injective), we have
left small gaps between the generating 1-cells so that they do not intersect with
each other.
The hyperfaces of [n; q] are precisely the maximal faces of [n; q] in the following
sense.
Proposition 2.9 ([17, Proposition 6.2.4]). Any face map [α; α] : [m; p] → [n; q] of
positive codimension factors through a hyperface of [n; q].

We will also need the following outer version of this proposition.
Proposition 2.10. Any outer face map [α; α] : [m; p] → [n; q] factors through an
outer hyperface of [n; q].
Proof. Recall that [α; α] is inner (= non-outer) if and only if α and all αk preserve
the top and bottom elements. We will consider the cases where either α or some
αk does not preserve the top elements; the other cases can be treated dually.

Since the “length” of [n; q] is n, the horizontal component of Θ2 [n; q] should
be ∆[n]. The description of the hom-categories of [n; q] tells us that the vertical
component of Θ2 [n; q] should assign the product ∆[qk+1 ] × · · · × ∆[qℓ ] to each 1b (where ∆[n]m is the
simplex {k, ℓ} in ∆[n]. The resulting functor χ1 : ∆[n]1 → ∆

for each α ∈ ∆[n]m compatible with the simplicial structure of ∆[n], and one can
check that the canonical isomorphisms indeed form such a compatible family. As
we mentioned above for the case m = 2, this isomorphism can be thought of as
witnessing the m-ary horizontal composition. The invertibility of this map says
that [n; q] is horizontally free, and the compatibility with the simplicial structure
says that the horizontal composition is coherent in the sense that it is associative,
the witnesses to associativity satisfy the pentagon law, and so on.
This “decomposition” provides a motivation for thinking of the objects in the

2.7. Oury’s elementary anodyne extensions. Joyal’s model structure for quasib can be characterised using:
categories on ∆
• the boundary inclusions ∂∆[n] ֒→ ∆[n];
• the (inner ) horn inclusions Λk [n] ֒→ ∆[n]; and
• the equivalence extension e : ∆[0] ֒→ J which is the nerve of the inclusion
{♦} ֒→ {♦ ∼

Oury constructs the Θ2 -version of those morphisms using the Leibniz box product
ˆ n as follows.

First, we describe the Leibniz construction. Suppose F : C1 × · · · × Cn → D is
a functor and D has finite colimits. Then the (n-ary) Leibniz construction
F̂ : C12 × · · · × Cn2 → D 2
of F , where 2 = {0 → 1} is the “walking arrow” category, is defined as follows. Let
fi : Xi0 → Xi1 be an object in Ci2 for each i. Then the assignment (ǫ1 , . . . , ǫn ) 7→

F (X1ǫ1 , . . . , Xnǫn ) defines a functor G : 2n → D. Denote by I the inclusion of
the full subcategory of 2n spanned by all non-terminal objects. Then G defines
a cone under the diagram GI, so we obtain an induced morphism colim GI →
F (X11 , . . . , Xn1 ). Sending (f1 , . . . , fn ) to this morphism defines the object part of
F̂ , and the morphism part is defined in the obvious way by the universal property.
Definition 2.21. The boundary inclusion ∂Θ2 [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is defined by the

where the first argument ∂∆[n] ֒→ ∆[n] is regarded as a map over ∆[n] in the
obvious way.
As its name suggests, this map is the “usual” boundary inclusion.
Proposition 2.22 ([12, Observation 3.84]). The map ∂Θ2 [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is
(isomorphic to) the inclusion of the cellular subset consisting precisely of those
maps into [n; q] that factor through objects of lower dimension.
Proposition 2.23. The cellular subset ∂Θ2 [n; q] ⊂ Θ2 [n; q] is generated by the
hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q].
Proof. This follows from Propositions 2.9 and 2.22.



For example, when [n; q] = [2; 0, 2] (see Table 1):

• 2 ∆[2]; ∆[0], ∂∆[2] is generated by δv2;0 , δv2;1 and δv2;2 .
It can be seen from the defining colimit diagram that ∂Θ2 [2; 0, 2] is the union of
these three cellular subsets. Thus ∂Θ2 [2; 0, 2] is indeed generated by the hyperfaces
of Θ2 [2; 0, 2].

Proposition 2.25. The map Λkh [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is (isomorphic to) the inclusion
of the cellular subset generated by all hyperfaces except for the k-th horizontal ones.
Proof. It follows from Proposition 2.22 and [12, Lemma 3.11] that this map is a
monomorphism. Thus it suffices to check that it has the correct image, which can
be done by considering the defining colimit diagram for Λkh [n; q].

For example, when [n; q] = [2; 0, 2] and k = 1:

Remark. The faces [α; α] : Θ2 [m; p] → Θ2 [n; q] not contained in the horizontal
horn Λkh [n; q] are precisely the k-th horizontal ones. In particular, Λkh [n; q] may be
missing faces of Θ2 [n; q] that have codimension greater than 1. For example, one
can check that Λ1h [2; 1, 1] is generated by the vertical hyperfaces

the position of the double arrow has no significance.) This differs from the more
commonly found definition of a horn (e.g. [2, 17]) as “boundary with one hyperface
removed”. In Section 4, we show that for our purposes such alternative horns may
be used in place of Oury’s ones.
Definition 2.26. The (k; i)-th vertical horn inclusion Λk;i

0 ≤ k ≤ n satisfies qk ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ i ≤ qk , is

if f ∈ JO .

2.8. Vertebrae and spines. Here we introduce the notions of vertebra and of
spine. The only vertebra of Θ2 [0] is the identity map. For [n; q] ∈ Θ2 with n ≥ 1:
• if 1 ≤ k ≤ n and qk = 0, then
[{k − 1, k}; id] : Θ2 [1; 0] → Θ2 [n; q]
is a vertebra; and
• if 1 ≤ k ≤ n and qk ≥ 1, then for each 1 ≤ i ≤ qk ,
[{k − 1, k}; {i − 1, i}] : Θ2 [1; 1] → Θ2 [n; q]
is a vertebra.
For example, Θ2 [2; 0, 2] has three vertebrae

Let Ξ[n; q] ⊂ Θ2 [n; q] denote the cellular subset generated by the vertebrae of
Θ2 [n; q], and call it the spine of Θ2 [n; q].
If [n; q] is [0], [1; 0] or [1; 1], then Θ2 [n; q] has a unique vertebra and Ξ[n; q] =
Θ2 [n; q]. We will call these cells mono-vertebral ; otherwise [n; q] is poly-vertebral.
Note that if [α; α] : [m; p] → [n; q] is inert then it restricts to a map between
the spines as in

terised by the following properties:

• a map f : X → Y into a fibrant cellular set Y is a fibration if and only if
it has the right lifting property with respect to all maps in JA .

In particular, the fibrant objects, called 2-quasi-categories, are precisely those
objects with the right lifting property with respect to all elementary A-anodyne
extensions.

We prove the results of the first kind by directly expressing each map in J as a
transfinite composite of pushouts of maps in cell(J ′ ). For those of the second kind,
we make use of the right cancellation property, i.e. we show that f and gf are
trivial cofibrations and then deduce that the cofibration g must also be trivial. In
each case, the proof reduces to checking the existence of certain gluing squares, as
defined below.
Suppose we have a pullback square

c2 such that Z = f (X) ∪ Y , and f is injective on f −1 (Z \ Y ) = X \ W . Then
in Θ
the square is also a pushout, and we will say Z is obtained from Y by gluing X
along W . Note that if Y is generated by a set S of cells in Z, then W is generated
by the pullbacks of Θ2 [n; q] s Z along f for all s ∈ S.
3. O-anodyne extensions and Ara’s model structure
c2 , which was characterised using the
Here we show Ara’s model structure on Θ
spine inclusions Ξ[n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q], can be alternatively characterised using the
inner horn inclusions. More precisely, we prove that elementary A-anodyne extensions are O-anodyne extensions, and also (elementary) O-anodyne extensions are
trivial cofibrations.
3.1. Elementary A-anodyne extensions are O-anodyne extensions. In this
subsection, we prove the following lemma.
Lemma 3.1. Every map in JA is an O-anodyne extension.
Since the O-anodyne extensions are closed under taking Leibniz products with
arbitrary monomorphisms (Theorem 2.32), and [id; e] : Θ2 [1; 0] → Θ2 [1; J] is isomorphic to the elementary O-anodyne extension Ψ1 [1; 0] ֒→ Φ1 [1; 0], it suffices to
show that the spine inclusions Ξ[n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] (which are the remaining “generating” elements of JA ) are O-anodyne extensions.
The corresponding result for quasi-categories has been proved by Joyal [8, Proposition 2.13]. Our proof presented below is essentially Joyal’s proof repeated twice,
first in the vertical direction and then in the horizontal direction. In each step, we
decompose the spine inclusion Ξ[n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] into three inclusions which, when
[n; q] = [3; 0], look like
(

.

In general, the first two maps glue the outer faces along lower dimensional spine(like) inclusions. The remaining non-degenerate cells are precisely those containing
both of the “endpoints” (i.e. 0, qk ∈ [qk ] in the vertical case and 0, n ∈ [n] in the
horizontal case). We can group such cells into pairs {x, y} so that the only difference
between x and y is whether they contain 1 (meaning 1 ∈ [qk ] in the vertical case

18

and 1 ∈ [n] in the horizontal case). Such a pair necessarily satisfies y = x · δ 1 (up
to interchanging x and y), e.g.

Thus the last inclusion can be obtained by gluing the x’s along Λ1 .
Definition 3.2. If S is any set of faces of Θ2 [n; q], we will write ΞS [n; q] ⊂ Θ2 [n; q]
for the cellular subset generated by Ξ[n; q] and S.
Proof of Lemma 3.1. Recall that Ξ[n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] for mono-vertebral [n; q] (i.e. for
[n; q] = [0], [1; 0] or [1; 1]) is the identity and hence trivially O-anodyne. These serve
as the base cases for our induction.
1;q
We first consider the case where n = 1. For any q ≥ 1, let Ξ† [1; q] = Ξ{δv } [1; q]
1;0 1;q
and let Ξ‡ [1; q] = Ξ{δv ,δv } [1; q]. We prove by induction on q that each of the
inclusions
Ξ[1; q] ֒→ Ξ† [1; q] ֒→ Ξ‡ [1; q] ֒→ Θ2 [1; q]
is an O-anodyne extension.
Assuming q ≥ 2, the first inclusion fits into the gluing square

Θ2 [1; q − 1]

Ξ† [1; q − 1]
y

⊂

Θ2 [1; q − 1]
δv1;0

Ξ† [1; q]

Ξ‡ [1; q]

Then a face map [id; α] : [1; p] → [1; q] corresponds to a cell in Θ2 [1; q] \ Ξ‡ [1; q] if
and only if 0, q ∈ im α. Thus the last inclusion can be obtained by gluing the faces
corresponding to those α with 0, 1, q ∈ im α along Λ1;1
v [1; p] in increasing order of
p. This completes the proof for the special case n = 1.
n
Now consider the general case. For any [n; q] ∈ Θ2 , let Ξ′ [n; q] = Ξ{δh } [n; q]
0 n
and let Ξ′′ [n; q] = Ξ{δh ,δh } [n; q]. We prove by induction on dim [n; q] that each of
the inclusions
Ξ[n; q] ֒→ Ξ′ [n; q] ֒→ Ξ′′ [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q]
is an O-anodyne extension.
If n = 1 then the first two inclusions are the identity and the last inclusion was
treated above. So we may assume n ≥ 2, in which case the first inclusion fits into

if and only if 0, n ∈ im α. Thus the last inclusion Ξ′′ [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] can be
obtained by gluing the faces corresponding to those [α; α] with 0, 1, n ∈ im α along
Λ1h [m; p] in increasing order of dim [m; p]. This completes the proof for the general
case.

3.2. Oury’s inner horn inclusions are trivial cofibrations. The aim of this
subsection is to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 3.3. Every map in Hh ∪ Hv is a trivial cofibration.
In fact, we will prove a wider class of “generalised inner horn inclusions” is
contained in the trivial cofibrations. These horns are constructed from the spines
by filling lower dimensional horns. Then the right cancellation property applied
to Ξ[n; q] ֒→ Λ[n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] implies the second factor is a trivial cofibration.
This general strategy is the same as that adopted by Joyal and Tierney to prove the
corresponding result for quasi-categories [9, Lemma 3.5] although the combinatorics
here is much more involved.
We start by gluing the outer hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] to Ξ[n; q] according to the
following total order ≺:
δv1;0 ≺ δv2;0 ≺ · · · ≺ δvn;0 ≺ δh0 ≺ δhn ≺ δv1;q1 ≺ δv2;q2 ≺ · · · ≺ δvn;qn .
(Note that not all of these hyperfaces may exist. The face δh0 (respectively δhn ) is
a hyperface only if q0 = 0 (resp. if qn = 0), and the hyperfaces δvk;0 and δvk;qk exist
only if qk ≥ 1.)
Lemma 3.4. The inclusion ΞS [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is a trivial cofibration for any
[n; q] ∈ Θ2 and for any set S of outer hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] that is downward
closed with respect to ≺.
Proof. We proceed by induction on |S|. Fix [n; q] ∈ Θ2 and a downward closed
set S of outer hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q]. If S is empty then ΞS [n; q] = Ξ[n; q] and
so the result follows trivially. So suppose |S| ≥ 1. Let δ : Θ2 [m; p] → Θ2 [n; q] be
′
the ≺-maximum element in S and let S ′ = S \ {δ}. Then ΞS [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q]
is a trivial cofibration by the inductive hypothesis, and hence it suffices to show

ΞS [n; q] ֒→ ΞS [n; q] is also a trivial cofibration. Since ΞS [n; q] can be obtained by

this reduces to showing we have X = ΞT [m; p] for some downward closed set T of
outer hyperfaces of [m; p] with |T | < |S|. Since δ is an outer hyperface and hence
inert, pulling back Ξ[n; q] along δ yields Ξ[m; p]. To describe the remaining cells
in X, we have to consider the following cases separately.
(1) δ = δvk;0 : In this case S ′ = {δvℓ;0 : ℓ < k, qℓ ≥ 1}. Thus X is generated by
Ξ[n; p] (where p = (q1 , . . . , qk − 1, . . . , qn )) and the pullbacks of these faces
δvℓ;0 ∈ S ′ along δvk;0 . For any ℓ < k with qℓ ≥ 1, the pullback of δvℓ;0 along
δvk;0 is δvℓ;0 [n; p], i.e. the square



T = δvℓ;0 [n; p] : ℓ < k, qℓ ≥ 1 = δvℓ;0 [n; p] : ℓ < k, pℓ ≥ 1 .

(2) δ = δh0 : In this case S ′ = {δvk;0 : qk ≥ 1}. Note that since δh0 is a hyperface,
we must have q1 = 0 and hence k 6= 1 for all δvk;0 ∈ S ′ . It then follows
that the pullback of δvk;0 along δh0 is δvk−1;0 [n − 1; p] where p = (q2 , . . . , qn ),


T = δvk−1;0 [n − 1; p] : qk ≥ 1 = δvk;0 [n − 1; p] : pk ≥ 1 .

(The second equality holds because pk−1 = qk .)
(3) δ = δhn : This case can be treated similarly to the previous one except
we may have δh0 ∈ S ′ . If this is the case, the pullback of δh0 along δhn is
δh0 [n − 1; p] where p = (q1 , . . . , qn−1 ), hence X = ΞT [n − 1; p] where


T = δvk;0 [n − 1; p] : pk ≥ 1 ∪ δh0 [n − 1; p] .

Since p1 = q1 = 0 (where the second equality follows from our assumption
that δh0 ∈ S ′ ), δh0 [n − 1; p] is indeed a hyperface of Θ2 [n − 1; p].

INNER HORNS FOR 2-QUASI-CATEGORIES

21

(4a) δ = δvk;qk and qk ≥ 2: The pullback of δvℓ;0 along δvk;qk is δvℓ;0 [n; p] (where
p = (q1 , . . . , qk − 1, . . . , qn )) for all ℓ, and similarly for δvℓ;qℓ . If q1 = 0, then
we know k 6= 1 and the pullback of δh0 ∈ S ′ along δvk;qk is δh0 [n; p]. Note in
this case δh0 [n; p] is a hyperface of Θ2 [n; p] since p1 = q1 = 0. Conversely,
if p1 = 0 then we must have q1 = 0 and so δh0 ∈ S ′ . Similarly, pn = 0 if
and only if qn = 0, in which case the pullback of δhn ∈ S ′ along δvk;qk is the
hyperface δhn [n; p]. Therefore X = ΞT [n; p] where:
– δvℓ;0 [n; p] ∈ T iff pℓ ≥ 1;
– δvℓ;qℓ [n; p] = δvℓ;pℓ [n; p] ∈ T iff ℓ < k and pℓ ≥ 1;
– δh0 [n; p] ∈ T iff p1 = 0; and
– δhn [n; p] ∈ T iff pn = 0.
(4b) δ = δv1;q1 and q1 = 1: The difference between this case and the previous one
is that the pullback of δv1;0 along δv1;q1 = δv1;1 is generated by the horizontal
hyperface δh0 [n; p] of Θ2 [n; p] = Θ2 [n; 0, q2 , . . . , qn ] and the point [{0}].
(This is essentially the intersection of two semicircles

horizontally composed with [n − 1; q2 , . . . , qn ].) Hence X = ΞT [n; p] where:
– δvℓ;0 [n; p] ∈ T iff pℓ ≥ 1;
– δh0 [n; p] ∈ T ; and
– δhn [n; p] ∈ T iff pn = 0.
(4c) δ = δvn;qn and qn = 1: This case is similar to the previous one, and we can
deduce X = ΞT [n; p] where p = (q1 , . . . , qn−1 , 0) and:
– δvℓ;0 [n; p] ∈ T iff pℓ ≥ 1;
– δvℓ;qℓ [n; p] = δvℓ;pℓ [n; p] ∈ T iff ℓ < n and pℓ ≥ 1;
– δh0 [n; p] ∈ T iff p1 = 0; and
– δhn [n; p] ∈ T .
(4d) δ = δvk;qk for some 2 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 and qk = 1: In this case, we have
p = (q1 , . . . , qk − 1, . . . , qn ) and the pullback of δvk;0 along δvk;qk is generated
by
[{0, . . . , k − 1}; id] : Θ2 [k − 1; p1 , . . . , pk−1 ] → Θ2 [n; p]
and
[{k, . . . , n}; id] : Θ2 [n − k; pk+1 , . . . , pn ] → Θ2 [n; p].
Observe that [{0, . . . , k − 1}; id] is contained in the hyperface δhn [n; p] if
pn = 0, and in the hyperface δvn;0 [n; p] if pn ≥ 1. Similarly, [{k, . . . , n}; id]
is contained in δh0 [n; p] or δv1;0 [n; p]. Therefore X = ΞT [n; p] where:
– δvℓ;0 [n; p] ∈ T iff ℓ 6= k and pℓ ≥ 1;
– δvℓ;qℓ [n; p] = δvℓ;pℓ [n; p] ∈ T iff ℓ < k and pℓ ≥ 1;
– δh0 [n; p] ∈ T iff p1 = 0; and
– δhn [n; p] ∈ T iff pn = 0.
In each of these cases, it is straightforward to check that T is a downward closed
set of outer hyperfaces of Θ2 [m; p]. Moreover, since the elements of T are obtained
by pulling back the elements in S ′ , we have |T | ≤ |S ′ | < |S|. This completes the

proof of Lemma 3.4.

We are particularly interested in the instance of Lemma 3.4 where S is the set
of all outer hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q]. Note that if [n; q] is poly-vertebral (i.e. [n; q] is
not [0], [1; 0] or [1; 1]) then each vertebra of [n; q] is an outer face. Thus in this case
it follows from Proposition 2.10 that ΞS [n; q] is generated by the outer hyperfaces
of Θ2 [n; q] alone. This is why the following definition does not mention the spine.
Definition 3.5. For any set S of faces of Θ2 [n; q], let ΥS [n; q] ⊂ Θ2 [n; q] denote
the cellular subset generated by all outer hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] and the faces in S.
We first consider the case where S is some set of inner vertical hyperfaces.
Definition 3.6. A set S of inner vertical hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] is called admissible
if it is not the set of all inner hyperfaces.
Note that if S is a non-admissible set of inner vertical hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q],
then all inner hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] must be vertical. Therefore we must have
n = 1 and S = {δv1;k : 1 ≤ k ≤ q1 − 1}.
Lemma 3.7. The inclusion ΥS [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is a trivial cofibration for any
poly-vertebral [n; q] ∈ Θ2 and for any admissible set S of inner vertical hyperfaces
of Θ2 [n; q].
Proof. Again, we proceed by induction on |S|. If S = ∅ then the lemma follows
from Lemma 3.4. So we may assume |S| ≥ 1. Choose an element δvk;i ∈ S, which
then necessarily satisfies 1 ≤ k ≤ n and 1 ≤ i ≤ qk − 1. Let S ′ = S \ {δvk;i }. By
a similar argument to that presented above for Lemma 3.4, what we must prove
reduces to showing that X in the gluing square
X

Θ2 [n; p]

ΥS [n; q]

is of the form X = ΥT [n; p] (where p = (q1 , . . . , qk − 1, . . . , qn )) for some admissible
set T of inner vertical hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; p] with |T | < |S|. Note that [n; p] must
be poly-vertebral as the only cell with an inner vertical hyperface of mono-vertebral
shape is Θ2 [1; 2], and for [n; q] = [1; 2] the only admissible S is the empty set.
We first show that the square
Υ∅ [n; p]

⊂

Θ2 [n; p]
δvk;i

Υ∅ [n; q]

⊂

ΥS [n; q]

is a pullback. Since qk ≥ 2 and pℓ = qℓ for ℓ 6= k, we have p1 = 0 if and only
if q1 = 0. Moreover, if p1 = q1 = 0 then the pullback of δh0 along δvk;i is δh0 [n; p].
Similarly, pn = 0 if and only if qn = 0, in which case the pullback of δhn along δvk;i
is δhn [n; p]. For the outer vertical hyperfaces, if qℓ ≥ 1 and either j = 0 or j = qℓ
then the pullback of δvℓ;j along δvk;i is δvℓ;j [n; p] except when (ℓ, j) = (k, qk ), in which
case the pullback is δvk;qk −1 [m; p] = δvk;pk [m; p]. Thus the above square is indeed a
pullback.

INNER HORNS FOR 2-QUASI-CATEGORIES

23

It then follows that X = ΥT [n; p] where T consists of the pullbacks of elements of
S along δvk;i . Similarly to the outer case considered above, the pullback of δvℓ;j ∈ S ′
along δvk;i is δvℓ;j [n; p] except when ℓ = k and j > i, in which case the pullback
is δvk;j−1 [n; p]. Hence T is a set of inner vertical hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; p]. Moreover
pulling back along δvk;i gives a bijection between S ′ and T and hence |T | = |S| − 1.
Thus it remains to show that T is admissible. Suppose otherwise, then as we
mentioned before the statement of Lemma 3.7, we must have [n; p] = [1; p1 ] and
′

|T | = {δv1;ℓ [1; p1 ] : 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ p1 − 1} = p1 − 1.
This implies |S| = |T | + 1 = p1 = q1 − 1. But then S contains all of the inner
hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] = Θ2 [1; q1 ], which contradicts our assumption that S is
admissible. This completes the proof of Lemma 3.7.

Now we consider the inner horizontal hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q]. Recall that for each
k;hα,α′ i
1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, we have a family of k-th horizontal hyperfaces δh
indexed by
hα, α′ i ∈ Shfl(qk , qk+1 ).
Definition 3.8. If S is a set of faces of Θ2 [n; q], we define
n
o
def
k;hα,α′ i
ShflS (qk , qk+1 ) = hα, α′ i ∈ Shfl(qk , qk+1 ) : δh
∈S .

Definition 3.9. A set S of inner hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] is called admissible if:
(i) S is not the set of all inner hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q];
(ii) there is at most one 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 such that
∅ 6= ShflS (qk , qk+1 ) 6= Shfl(qk , qk+1 )
(we will write kS for such k if it exists); and
(iii) if kS exists, then ShflS (qkS , qkS +1 ) is downward closed with respect to the
order described in Section 2.1.
Note that Definition 3.9 reduces to Definition 3.6 if S contains no horizontal
hyperfaces.
Remark. The role of Definition 3.9(iii) is to ensure that the intersections (meaning
pullbacks) of the hyperfaces in S are well-behaved so that we do not have to worry
about faces of Θ2 [n; q] of codimension larger than 2. For example, consider the
case [n; q] = [2; 2, 1]. There are three inner horizontal hyperfaces in this case,
corresponding to the three (2, 1)-shuffles hα, α′ i < hβ, β ′ i < hγ, γ ′ i; graphically, the
shuffles

of codimension 3, which is “too small”. If S is an admissible set containing δh
1;hγ,γ ′ i

, then (iii) implies that S also contains δh

1;hγ,γ ′ i
1;hβ,β ′ i
face is contained in the intersection of δh
(or δh
) and δh
, we may
essentially disregard it.
There are two obviously downward closed subsets of Shfl(qk , qk+1 ), namely ∅
and Shfl(qk , qk+1 ). Definition 3.9(ii) asks that we always have one of these two
subsets for any value of k, with a possible exception of k = kS . This simplifies the
proof and in particular the descriptions of the sets T1 and T1′ defined below, but it
is not essential. Indeed, it seems possible to prove a variant of Lemma 3.10 where
(ii) is removed from Definition 3.9 and (iii) is replaced by:
(iii’) ShflS (qk , qk+1 ) is downward closed for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.
Although this modification makes Lemma 3.10 slightly more general, we see no use
in this extra generality.
Lemma 3.10. The inclusion ΥS [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is a trivial cofibration for any
poly-vertebral [n; q] ∈ Θ2 and for any admissible set S of inner hyperfaces of
Θ2 [n; q].
Proof. Let Sh ⊂ S denote the set of horizontal hyperfaces in S. We proceed by
induction on dim [n; q] and |Sh |. If Sh = ∅ then the result follows from Lemma 3.7,
so we may assume |Sh | ≥ 1. Choose 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 so that S contains a k-th
horizontal hyperface, where we take k = kS if the latter exists. Let hα, α′ i ∈
 k;hα,α′ i
is admissible, and so
ShflS (qk , qk+1 ) be a maximal one. Then S ′ = S \ δh
once again it suffices to prove that X in the gluing square

(where p = (q1 , . . . , qk−1 , qk + qk+1 , qk+2 , . . . , qn )) is of the form X = ΥT [n − 1; p]
for some admissible T . By a similar argument to that presented in the proof of
Lemma 3.7, [n − 1; p] must be poly-vertebral.
Claim 0. Let Y ⊂ Θ2 [n − 1; p] be the cellular subset defined by the following
pullback square:

Then Y is generated by the outer hyperfaces of Θ2 [n − 1; p], i.e. Y = Υ∅ [n − 1; p].
Proof. We first show the containment Y ⊂ Υ∅ [n−1; p]. If q1 = 0, then the pullback
k;hα,α′ i
of the hyperface δh0 along δh
is δh0 [n − 1; p]. Since δh0 [n − 1; p] is an outer face
of Θ2 [n − 1; p] (of codimension q2 + 1 if k = 1 and of codimension 1 otherwise), it
is contained in Υ∅ [n − 1; p] by Proposition 2.10. The hyperface δhn (if it exists) can
be treated dually.

25

Next we consider the vertical hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q]. Fix 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n with qℓ ≥ 1.
k;hα,α′ i
Then the pullback of δvℓ;0 along δh
is:
• δvℓ;0 [n − 1; p] if ℓ < k;
• δvℓ−1;0 [n − 1; p] if ℓ > k + 1; and
• contained in δvk;0 [n − 1; p] if ℓ = k or ℓ = k + 1.
The hyperfaces δvℓ;qℓ can be treated dually. This proves Y ⊂ Υ∅ [n − 1; p].
For the other containment Υ∅ [n − 1; p] ⊂ Y , we must show that any outer
hyperface of Θ2 [n − 1; p] can be obtained by pulling back some outer hyperface
k;hα,α′ i
of Θ2 [n; q] along δh
. If p1 = 0, then q1 = 0 (because p1 = q1 if k 6= 1 and
p1 = q1 + q2 if k = 1) and the hyperface δh0 [n − 1; p] is precisely the pullback of δh0
k;hα,α′ i
along δh
. The other horizontal hyperface δhn−1 [n − 1; p] (if it exists) can be
treated dually.
Now we consider the vertical hyperfaces of Θ2 [n − 1; p]. Fix 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ m = n − 1
k;hα,α′ i
with pℓ ≥ 1. Then the hyperface δvℓ;0 [n − 1; p] is the pullback (along δv
) of:
ℓ;0
• δv if ℓ < k;
• δvℓ+1;0 if ℓ > k;
• δvk;0 if ℓ = k and α(1) = 1; and
• δvk+1;0 if ℓ = k and α′ (1) = 1.
Note that if δvk;0 [n − 1; p] exists then pk ≥ 1 so α(1) ∈ [qk ] and α′ (1) ∈ [qk+1 ] are
well-defined. Moreover, hα, α′ i ∈ Shfl(qk , qk+1 ) implies that we must have either
α(1) = 1 or α′ (1) = 1. Thus the above list indeed covers all possible cases.
The remaining hyperfaces δvℓ;pℓ [n−1; p] can be treated dually, and this completes

the proof of Claim 0.
It now follows from the following claims that X = ΥT [n − 1; p] holds for

The dual version of this claim relates, for k + 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n, the ℓ-th horizontal
hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] to the (ℓ − 1)-th horizontal hyperfaces of Θ2 [n − 1; p].
Proof. If 1 ≤ ℓ < k − 1 (note the strict inequality) then both (i) and (ii) are
straightforward since
Shfl(pℓ , pℓ+1 ) = Shfl(qℓ , qℓ+1 )

we are given a commutative square

k−1;hγ,γ ′ i
for all v, and in either case [ζ; ζ] obviously factors through δh
[n − 1; p] for
any hγ, γ ′ i ∈ Shfl(pk−1 , pk ).) Since the (pk−1 , pk )-shuffles are the maximal nondegenerate simplices in ∆[pk−1 ] × ∆[pk ], the map hζk−1 , ζk i admits a factorisation

such that hγ, γ ′ i is a (pk−1 , pk )-shuffle. Then [ζ; ζ] clearly factors through the

k;hβ,β ′ i

k;hα,α′ i

along δh

for some hβ, β ′ i ∈ Shfl(qk , qk+1 ) with hβ, β ′ i < hα, α′ i.

Proof. For (i), suppose hβ, β ′ i is a (qk , qk+1 )-shuffle with hβ, β ′ i  hα, α′ i. Then by
Proposition 2.3, we can choose j ∈yhα, α′ i such that (α(j), α′ (j)) 6= (β(j), β ′ (j)).

The pullback of δh

To prove (ii), suppose j ∈yhα, α i. Then the hyperface δvk;j [n − 1; p] is the pullk;hβ,β ′ i
k;hα,α′ i
back of δh
along δh
where hβ, β ′ i is the (qk , qk+1 )-shuffle corresponding
to j under Proposition 2.4. Note that hβ, β ′ i is an immediate predecessor of hα, α′ i
and so in particular hβ, β ′ i < hα, α′ i.

Claim 3. For any 1 ≤ ℓ < k (respectively k + 1 < ℓ ≤ n) and 1 ≤ i ≤ qℓ − 1, the
k;hα,α′ i
pullback of δvℓ;i along δh
is δvℓ;i [n − 1; p] (resp. δvℓ−1;i [n − 1; p]).
Proof. This is straightforward to check.



Claim 4. Fix 1 ≤ i ≤ qk − 1 (respectively 1 ≤ i ≤ qk+1 − 1). Then the pullback of
k;hα,α′ i
δvk;i (resp. δvk+1;i ) along δh
is:
• precisely δvk;j [n − 1; p] if α−1 (i) = {j} (resp. (α′ )−1 (i) = {j}) for some
1 ≤ j ≤ pk − 1; and
• contained in δvk;j [n − 1; p] for some j ∈yhα, α′ i otherwise.
Proof. We will only consider the hyperfaces δvk;i as δvk+1;i can be treated dually.
The first case is straightforward to check. In the second case, let j = min(α−1 (i)).
k;hα,α′ i
Then clearly the pullback of δvk;i along δh
is contained in δvk;j [n − 1; p], and
′
so it remains to show that j ∈yhα, α i. Note that 1 ≤ i ≤ qk − 1 and α(j) = i
imply 1 ≤ j ≤ pk − 1. Moreover, α(j − 1) = α(j) − 1 by our choice of j, and
α(j + 1) = i = α(j) since |α−1 (i)| ≥ 2. Therefore j ∈yhα, α′ i.

Now we go back to the proof of Lemma 3.10. We can deduce from Claims 1 to 4
that X = ΥT [n − 1; p]. It thus remains to prove that T is an admissible set of inner
hyperfaces of Θ2 [n − 1; p]. It is clear from our definitions of T1 and T1′ that, for any
1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n − 2, either ShflT (pℓ , pℓ+1 ) = ∅ or ShflT (pℓ , pℓ+1 ) = Shfl(pℓ , pℓ+1 ). Thus
T satisfies Definition 3.9(ii) and (iii). To prove T also satisfies (i), we will assume
otherwise (i.e. T contains all of the inner hyperfaces of Θ2 [n − 1; p]) and deduce
then S does not satisfy (i), which is a contradiction.
For any 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k − 1, we have ShflT (pℓ , pℓ+1 ) = Shfl(pℓ , pℓ+1 ) and so
our definition of T1 implies ShflS (qℓ , qℓ+1 ) = Shfl(qℓ , qℓ+1 ). Dually, we have
ShflS (qℓ , qℓ+1 ) = Shfl(qℓ , qℓ+1 ) for all k + 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n. Thus S contains all of
the ℓ-th horizontal hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] for all 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n − 1 with ℓ 6= k.
Next we consider the k-th horizontal hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q]. Note that since S
is admissible, S contains all of the k-th horizontal hyperfaces if and only if hα, α′ i
is the maximum (qk , qk+1 )-shuffle. We will prove this latter statement. For any
1 ≤ j ≤ pk − 1, T contains δvk;j [n − 1; p] and so our definitions of T2 , T4 and T4′
imply that one of the following must hold:
• j ∈yhα, α′ i;
• α(j ′ ) 6= α(j) for all j ′ ∈ [pk ] with j ′ 6= j; or
• α′ (j ′ ) 6= α′ (j) for all j ′ ∈ [pk ] with j ′ 6= j.
Therefore phα, α′ i = ∅, or equivalently, hα, α′ i is the maximum (qk , qk+1 )-shuffle
(by Proposition 2.4).
Lastly, we consider the inner vertical hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q]. For any 1 ≤ ℓ < k
and for any 1 ≤ i ≤ qℓ − 1, T contains δvℓ;j [n − 1; p] and so our definition of T3
implies that δvℓ;j ∈ S. Dually, δvℓ;j ∈ S for all k +1 < ℓ ≤ n and for all 1 ≤ j ≤ qℓ −1.
Note that hα, α′ i ∈ Shfl(qk , qk+1 ) is the maximum one and so we have
α = {0, 1, . . . , qk , qk , . . . , qk },
| {z }
qk+1 times

′

α = {0, . . . , 0, 0, 1, . . . , qk+1 }.
| {z }
qk times

Thus for each 1 ≤ i ≤ qk − 1, δvk;i [n − 1; p] ∈ T and our definition of T4 imply that
δvk;i ∈ S. Similarly, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ qk+1 − 1, δvk;qk +i ∈ T and our definition of T4′
imply that δvk+1;i ∈ S. This completes the proof of Lemma 3.10.

Proof of Lemma 3.3. The desired result follows from Lemma 3.10 since setting

S = all inner hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] except for δvk;i
yields ΥS [n; q] = Λk;i
v [n; q] by Proposition 2.27 and setting

S = {all inner hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] except for the k-th horizontal ones}
yields ΥS [n; q] = Λkh [n; q] by Proposition 2.25 for the appropriate ranges of k and
i.

Θ2 [n; q] ∼

In this subsection, we regard Θ2 [n; q] as a cellular subset of Ψk [n; q] via this map.

∼

Proof. We will prove Lemma 3.11 by induction on dim [n; q]. Note that the base
case is trivial since Ψ1 [1; 0] ֒→ Φ1 [1; 0] is isomorphic to the elementary A-anodyne
extension [id; e] : Θ2 [1; 0] ֒→ Θ2 [1; J]; indeed, both of these maps are isomorphic to
the nerve of the 2-functor that looks like:

For the inductive step, it suffices to show that both Θ2 [n; q] ֒→ Ψk [n; q] and
Θ2 [n; q] ֒→ Φk [n; q] are trivial cofibrations. These facts follow from Lemmas 3.12

We may assume k ≤ n − 1 since the dual argument covers the case k ≥ 2 and our

Let X1 ⊂ Φk [n; q] be the cellular subset generated by X0 and those (m; p)cells [α; α] satisfying α(m) = k. Since we are assuming k ≤ n − 1, this condition

k () = {j}; and

(By the trivial degeneracy of a cell, we mean the cell itself. Also, the codomain of
any δ appearing in the form [α; α] · δ in this proof is assumed to be [m; p] so that
[α; α] · δ is well-defined.) This completes the proof.

Next, let X2 ⊂ Φk [n; q] be the cellular subset generated by X1 and those cells

Applying the box product functor  to this lift yields a map

[δ k ; id, . . . , !, . . . , id] : Φk [n − 1; p] → Φk [n; q]

where p = (q1 , . . . , qk−1 , 0, qk+2 , . . . , qn ). This map factors through Ψk [n; q] because its image is generated by the cells of the form [δ k ; α]. Moreover, one can
check by comparing (4a-d) and (∗∗) (the latter of which appeared in the second

This completes the proof for the first case.
Next consider the case qk+1 ≥ 2. The discussion before Lemma 3.16 shows that
the set of non-degenerate cells in Ψk [n; q] \ X3 can be partitioned into subsets of
the form
 k
[δ ; α], [δ k ; α] · δvk;jα
where [δ k ; α] is an (n − 1; p)-cell satisfying (4a-e). We prove that Ψk [n; q] may
α

be obtained from X3 by gluing such [δ k α] along the vertical horn Λk;j
v

in lexicographically increasing order of dim[n − 1; p] and |αk ()|. Note that this
horn is inner by the definition of jα .
Fix a non-degenerate (n − 1; p)-cell [δ k ; α] satisfying (4a-e). We must check that
the appropriate faces of [δ k ; α] are contained either in X3 or in some (n − 1; p′ )-cell
[δ k ; β] satisfying (4a-e) such that:
• dim[n − 1; p′ ] < dim[n − 1; p]; or
• dim[n − 1; p′ ] ≤ dim[n − 1; p] and |βk−1 ()| < |α−1
k ()|.
If iα ≥ 1:
• any horizontal hyperface of [δ k ; α] is contained in X2 ;
• [δ k ; α] · δvℓ;j is contained in X3 for any ℓ 6= k and for any j ∈ [pℓ ];
• [δ k ; α] · δvk;j , where jα 6= j 6= jα + 1, is:
– contained in X3 if αk+1 · δ j is not surjective; and
– a (possibly trivial) degeneracy of some cell that satisfies (4a-e) otherwise; and
• [δ k ; α] · δvk;jα +1 is:
– contained in Θ2 [n; q] if αk (j) = ♦ for all j 6= jα + 1; and
– a (possibly trivial) degeneracy of some (n − 1; p′ )-cell [δ k ; β] that satisfies (4a-d) otherwise.
Note in the last clause, the cell [δ k ; β] may not satisfy (4e). However, at least we
k
know dim[n − 1; p′ ] < dim[n − 1; p] and |βk−1 ()| < |α−1
k ()|. Hence if [δ ; γ] is an

and
|γk−1 ()| = |βk−1 ()| < |α−1
k ()|.
A similar analysis can be done for the case iα = 0 too, and this completes the
proof.

4. Alternative horizontal horns
We now consider a slightly different set of horn inclusions.
Definition 4.1. Given [n; q] ∈ Θ2 , 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 and a (qk , qk+1 )-shuffle hα, α′ i,
k;hα,α′ i
let Λh
[n; q] ⊂ Θ2 [n; q] denote the cellular subset generated by all hyperfaces
k;hα,α′ i

of Θ2 [n; q] except for δh

.

We write Hh′ for the set of all such alternative inner horizontal horn inclusions
k;hα,α′ i
Λh
[n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q]. We prove Hh ⊂ cell(Hh′ ∪ Hv ) and that Hh′ is contained
in the trivial cofibrations.

4.1. Oury’s horn inclusions can be obtained from the alternative ones.
The purpose of this subsection is to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 4.2. Every map in Hh is contained in cell(Hh′ ∪ Hv ).
Similarly to the proof of Lemma 3.3, we must consider a wider class of horn
inclusions.
Definition 4.3. Given a set S of hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q], let ΛS [n; q] ⊂ Θ2 [n; q]
denote the cellular subset generated by all hyperfaces except for those in S.
Proposition 4.4. For any set S of inner hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q], the cellular subset
ΛS [n; q] ⊂ Θ2 [n; q] is equal to ΥT [n; q] where T is the set of all inner hyperfaces
of Θ2 [n; q] that are not in S.
Proof. Compare Definitions 3.5 and 4.3.



Recall that if S is a set of faces of Θ2 [n; q] and 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 then we write
n
o
k;hα,α′ i
ShflS (qk , qk+1 ) = hα, α′ i ∈ (qk , qk+1 ) : δh
∈S .

Lemma 4.5. The inclusion ΛS [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is contained in:
(i) cell(Hv ) if S is a non-empty set of k-th vertical hyperfaces for some 1 ≤
k ≤ n; and
(ii) cell(Hh′ ∪ Hv ) if S is a non-empty set of k-th horizontal hyperfaces for some
1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 and ShflS (qk , qk+1 ) is upward closed.
Note that Lemma 4.2 follows from Lemma 4.5(ii) by setting S to be the set of
all k-th horizontal hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q].
Proof. We will prove (i) by induction on |S|. By assumption, we can write S as

S = δvk;i : i ∈ IS

for some 1 ≤ k ≤ n and ∅ 6= IS ⊂ {1, . . . , qk − 1}. If IS = {i} is a singleton,
then ΛS [n; q] = Λk;i
So assume |S| ≥ 2.
v [n; q] and
 hence the result follows trivially.
′
Choose i ∈ IS and let S ′ = δvk;j : j ∈ IS \ {i} . Then ΛS [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is in
cell(Hv ) by the inductive hypothesis. Therefore it suffices to prove that the upper

X = ΛT [n; p] where


T = δvk;j : j ∈ IS , j < i ∪ δvk;j−1 : j ∈ IS , j > i .

Since |T | = |S| − 1, the desired inclusion is in cell(Hv ) by the inductive hypothesis.
 k;hα,α′ i
Now we prove (ii) by induction on |S|. If S = δh
is a singleton then
k;hα,α′ i

ΛS [n; q] = Λh

[n; q] and hence the result follows trivially. So assume |S| ≥ 2.

Then by the inductive hypothesis, Λ [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is in cell(Hh ∪ Hv ). Thus

it suffices to prove that ΛS [n; q] ֒→ ΛS [n; q] too is in cell(Hh′ ∪ Hv ). Indeed, it
follows from Claims 0 to 4 in the proof of Lemma 3.10 that we have a gluing square

square is essentially the first square that appears in the proof of Lemma 3.10.)
Note that phα, α′ i = ∅ if and only if hα, α′ i is the maximum (qk , qk+1 )-shuffle,
but the latter is impossible since |S| ≥ 2 and hα, α′ i is minimal in S. Hence
ΛT [n − 1; p] ֒→ Θ2 [n − 1; p] is in cell(Hv ) by (i).

4.2. Alternative horn inclusions are trivial cofibrations. The purpose of this
subsection is to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 4.6. Every map in Hh′ is a trivial cofibration.
Once again, we consider a wider class of horn inclusions. Suppose we have fixed
[n; q] ∈ Θ2 , 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 and a (qk , qk+1 )-shuffle hζ, ζ ′ i. (Note that the inequality
1 ≤ n − 1 in particular implies that [n; q] is poly-vertebral.) Let

I = hα, α′ i ∈ Shfl(qk , qk+1 ) : hα, α′ i ≤ hζ, ζ ′ i .
Lemma 4.7. If U is a set of the form

 k;hα,α′ i
U = δh
: hα, α′ i ∈ IU

for some non-empty, upward closed subset IU ⊂ I, then the inclusion ΛU [n; q] ֒→
Θ2 [n; q] is a trivial cofibration.
Here IU is upward closed in I but not necessarily in Shfl(qk , qk+1 ). Thus in
general Shfl(qk , qk+1 ) \ IU is not downward closed, and this is why Lemma 4.7 does
not follow directly from Proposition 4.4 and Lemma 3.10.
Note that since hζ, ζ ′ i is the maximum element in I, any non-empty, upward
closed IU ⊂ I will always have hζ, ζ ′ i ∈ IU . Also observe that Lemma 4.6 follows
 k;hζ,ζ ′ i
from Lemma 4.7 by setting U = δh
.

Proof. We prove Lemma 4.7 by induction on |I \ IU | (so we start with the case
IU = I and progressively make IU smaller). For the base case, observe that

hα, α′ i ∈ Shfl(qk , qk+1 ) : hα, α′ i  hζ, ζ ′ i

is an upward closed, proper subset of Shfl(qk , qk+1 ). Thus, when IU = I the
inclusion ΛU [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is a trivial cofibration by Proposition 4.4 and the
dual of Lemma 3.10.
For the inductive step, assume IU 6= I. Choose a maximal element hα, α′ i ∈ I \IU
′
and let IU ′ = IU ∪ {hα, α′ i}. Then ΛU [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] is a trivial cofibration by

(where p = (q1 , . . . , qk + qk+1 , . . . , qn )) is a trivial cofibration. We again use
Lemma 3.10. More precisely, we claim that X has the form X = ΥT [n − 1; p]
for
T = T1 ∪ T2 ∪ T3 ∪ T4 ∪ T4′ ∪ T5
where
 ℓ;hγ,γ ′i
T 1 = δh
[n − 1; p] : 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n − 1, hγ, γ ′ i ∈ Shfl(pℓ , pℓ+1 ) ,

T2 = δvk;j [n − 1; p] : j ∈yhα, α′ i ,

T3 = δvℓ;j [n − 1; p] : ℓ 6= k, 1 ≤ j ≤ qℓ − 1 ,


T5 = δvk;j [n − 1; p] : j ∈ phα, α′ i, α(j) = ζ(j) .

Aside from T5 , these sets are essentially special cases of the sets with the same
names in the proof of Lemma 3.10. More precisely, we have set S ′ to be the set
of inner hyperfaces of Θ2 [n; q] that are not in U ′ , then merged T1 and T1′ into a
single set and similarly for T3 , and unwound the conditions involving S ′ . Thus for
much of the proof that X = ΥT [n − 1; p] holds, we can reuse Claims 0 to 4 from
the proof of Lemma 3.10.
k;hβ,β ′ i
The following claim relates the hyperfaces δh
of Θ2 [n; q] with hβ, β ′ i ∈

the elements of T5 . Note that if 1 ≤ j ≤ pk −1 and j ∈

implies that δvk;j [n − 1; p] is contained in T2 , T4 or T4′ .
Claim 5.

k;hβ,β ′ i

k;hα,α′ i

is contained in δvk;j [n − 1; p] for some 1 ≤ j ≤ pk − 1
such that either j ∈

pullback of δh

hβ, β i  hζ, ζ i.
Proof. For (i), fix hβ, β ′ i ∈ Shfl(qk , qk+1 ) with hβ, β ′ i  hζ, ζ ′ i. Note that if β(j) 6=
k;hβ,β ′ i
k;hα,α′ i
α(j) for some j ∈ [qk +qk+1 ], then the pullback of δh
along δh
is contained
in δvk;j [n − 1; p]. Thus it suffices to prove that there exists some j ∈ [qk + qk+1 ] such
that β(j) 6= α(j) and either j ∈
/ phα, α′ i or α(j) = ζ(j).
Suppose otherwise. Then in particular β(j) = α(j) for all j ∈ [qk +qk+1 ]\phα, α′ i.
Since phα, α′ i contains no two consecutive integers, it follows that β(j) 6= α(j)
implies β(j) = α(j) + 1 for any j ∈ [qk + qk+1 ]. Now for each j ∈ [qk + qk+1 ]:
• if β(j) = α(j) then β(j) ≤ ζ(j) because hα, α′ i < hζ, ζ ′ i; and

• if β(j) 6= α(j), then α(j) < ζ(j) by assumption and hence β(j) = α(j)+1 ≤
ζ(j).
Therefore we have hβ, β ′ i ≤ hζ, ζ ′ i, which is the desired contradiction.
To prove (ii), let j ∈ phα, α′ i and suppose α(j) = ζ(j). Then hβ, β ′ i  hζ, ζ ′ i for
the immediate successor hβ, β ′ i of hα, α′ i corresponding to j, and δvk;j [n − 1; p] is

We can deduce X = ΥT [n − 1; p] from Claims 0 to 5, and it remains to check
that T is admissible, i.e. T satisfies Definition 3.9(i-iii). Since it contains all of the
inner horizontal hyperfaces of Θ2 [n − 1; p], T clearly satisfies (ii) and (iii). For (i),
observe that hα, α′ i < hζ, ζ ′ i implies there exists an immediate successor hβ, β ′ i
of hα, α′ i such that hβ, β ′ i ≤ hζ, ζ ′ i. If j ∈ phα, α′ i is the element corresponding
to hβ, β ′ i, then α(j) = β(j) − 1 < ζ(j) and so T does not contain δvk;j [n − 1; p].
Therefore T is not the set of all inner hyperfaces of Θ2 [n − 1; p].

5. Most horizontal equivalence extensions are redundant
The aim of this very short section is to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1. For any [0] 6= [n; q] ∈ Θ2 , the horizontal equivalence extension
e

ˆ
(Θ2 [0] ֒→ J)×(∂Θ
2 [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q])
is contained in cell(Hh ).
ˆ
Proof. Fix [0] 6= [n; q] ∈ Θ2 and consider e×(∂Θ
2 [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q]), whose domain
we denote by X. Let Y ⊂ J × Θ2 [n; q] be the cellular subset generated by X
and all cells that do not contain the vertex (, n). Then for any non-degenerate
φ : Θ2 [m; p] → Y that does not factor through X, there is unique 1 ≤ kφ ≤ m
such that π1 ◦ φ(kφ − 1) =  and π1 ◦ φ(k) = ♦ for all kφ ≤ k ≤ m, where
π1 : J × Θ2 [n; q] → J is the projection. Observe that for any non-degenerate φ in
Y \ X, either φ satisfies
(†) π2 ◦ φ(kφ ) = π2 ◦ φ(kφ − 1)
or there is a unique non-degenerate cell ψ in Y \ X satisfying (†) such that φ is
a (unique) kψ -th horizontal hyperface of ψ. Therefore the non-degenerate cells in
Y \ X can be partitioned into pairs of the form

k ;h!,idi
φ, φ · δhα

where φ is an (m; p)-cell satisfying (†) (which necessarily has pkφ = 0). We prove
k
that Y may be obtained from X by gluing such φ along the horn Λhφ [m; p] in
lexicographically increasing order of dim [m; p] and (π1 ◦ φ)−1 () . (Here | − |
counts the number of objects.)
Fix an (m; p)-cell φ in Y \ X satisfying (†). We must check that all hyperfaces
of φ except for the (unique) kα -th horizontal one are contained either in X or in
some (m′ ; p′ )-cell ψ satisfying (†) such that either:
• dim[m′ ; p′ ] < dim [m; p]; or
• dim[m′ ; p′ ] = dim [m; p] and (π1 ◦ ψ)−1 () < (π1 ◦ φ)−1 () .
Indeed:
k −1;hid,!i
• φ · δhφ
may or may not satisfy (†), but we know

π1 ◦ (φ · δ kφ −1 )
() = (π1 ◦ φ)−1 () − 1;

• for any 0 ≤ k < kφ − 1 with
(π2 ◦ φ)−1 (π2 ◦ φ(k)) ≥ 2,
any k-th horizontal hyperface of φ is a (possibly trivial) degeneracy of some
cell satisfying (†) with dimension strictly lower than dim [m; p]; and
• any other hyperface of φ (excluding the kα -th horizontal one) is contained
in X.
Moreover φ(kφ − 1) = (, π2 ◦ φ(kφ )) and hence π2 ◦ φ(kφ ) 6= n. This implies kφ 6= m
k
and it follows that the horn Λhφ [m; p] is inner. Thus the inclusion X ֒→ Y is in
cell(Hh ).
Now consider the remaining non-degenerate cells φ : Θ2 [m; p] → J × Θ2 [n; q]
that are not in Y . Let kφ ∈ [m] be the smallest such that π2 ◦ φ(kφ ) = n. Note
that [n; q] 6= [0] implies kφ 6= 0. Observe that for any non-degenerate cell φ in
(J × Θ2 [n; q]) \ Y , either φ satisfies
(‡) π1 ◦ φ(kφ ) = ♦
or there is a unique non-degenerate cell ψ in (J × Θ2 [n; q]) \ Y satisfying (‡) such
that φ is a (unique) kψ -th horizontal hyperface of ψ. Therefore the non-degenerate
cells in (J × Θ2 [n; q]) \ Y can be partitioned into pairs of the form

k ;hid,!i
φ, φ · δhφ

where φ is an (m; p)-cell satisfying (‡) (which necessarily has pkφ +1 = 0). We prove
k
that J ×Θ2[n; q] may be obtained from Y by gluing such φ along the horn Λhφ [m; p]
in increasing order of dim [m; p].
Fix an (m; p)-cell φ in (J × Θ2 [n; q]) \ Y satisfying (‡). We must check that
all hyperfaces of φ except for the (unique) kα -th one are contained either in Y or
in some cell that satisfies (‡) and has dimension strictly smaller than dim [m; p].
Indeed:
• the unique (kφ + 1)-th horizontal hyperface of φ (which may be inner or
outer depending on whether kφ + 1 = m) is:
– a degeneracy of some non-degenerate cell in (J × Θ2 [n; q]) \ Y satisfying (‡) of dimension dim [m; p] − 2 if kφ + 3 ≤ m (in which case we
necessarily have φ(kφ + 3) = (, n)); and
– contained in Y otherwise;
• for any kφ + 1 < k ≤ m, the unique k-th horizontal hyperface of φ is a
(possibly trivial) degeneracy of some cell satisfying (‡) of dimension strictly
lower than dim [m; p];
• for any 0 ≤ k < kφ with
(π2 ◦ φ)−1 (π2 ◦ φ(k)) ≥ 2,
any k-th horizontal hyperface of φ is a (possibly trivial) degeneracy of some
cell satisfying (‡) of dimension strictly lower than dim [m; p]; and
• any other hyperface of φ (excluding the kα -th horizontal one) is contained
in Y .
Moreover, the horn Λkhα [m; p] is inner since (‡) implies kφ 6= m. This completes the
proof.

6. Characterisation of fibrations into 2-quasi-categories
Recall the sets Hh , Hv , Ev defined in Section 2.7, the set JA defined in Section 2.9
and the set Hh′ defined in Section 4. By combining Theorem 2.33 and all of the
results we have proved, we obtain the following theorem.
c2 and suppose that Y is a 2-quasiTheorem 6.1. Let f : X → Y be a map in Θ
category. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) f is a fibration with respect to Ara’s model structure;
(ii) f has the right lifting property with respect to all maps in JA ;
(iii) f has the right lifting property with respect to all maps in Hh ∪Hv ∪Ev ∪{e};
and
(iv) f has the right lifting property with respect to all maps in Hh′ ∪Hv ∪Ev ∪{e}.
Proof. (i) ⇔ (ii): This equivalence is part of Theorem 2.33.
(i) ⇒ (iii): The elements of Hh and Hv are trivial cofibrations by Lemma 3.3,
and similarly for Ev by Lemma 3.11. The horizontal equivalence extension e is also
a trivial cofibration since e ∈ Eh ⊂ JA .
(iii) ⇒ (ii): We have the containment JA ⊂ cell(JO ) = cell(Hh ∪ Hv ∪ Eh ∪ Ev )
by Lemma 3.1. But Eh ⊂ {e} ∪ cell(Hh ) holds by Lemma 5.1 and so cell(JO ) =
cell(Hh ∪ Hv ∪ Ev ∪ {e}).
(i) ⇒ (iv): The elements of Hh′ are trivial cofibrations by Lemma 4.6.
(iv) ⇒ (iii): This follows from the containment Hh ⊂ cell(Hh′ ∪ Hv ), which is

precisely Lemma 4.2.
Since e admits a retraction, we obtain the following corollary by setting Y to be
the terminal cellular set Θ2 [0].
c2 be a cellular set. Then the following are equivalent:
Corollary 6.2. Let X ∈ Θ
(i) X is a 2-quasi-category;
(ii) X has the right lifting property with respect to all maps in JA ;
(iii) X has the right lifting property with respect to all maps in Hh ∪ Hv ∪ Ev ;
and
(iv) X has the right lifting property with respect to all maps in Hh′ ∪ Hv ∪ Ev .
c2 ,
The following corollary says that, when detecting left Quillen functors out of Θ
we may replace the infinite family Ev by a single map [id; e] : Θ2 [1; 0] → Θ2 [1; J].
Note that Theorem 2.11 implies cell(I) is precisely the set of monomorphisms in
c2 where

I = ∂Θ2 [n; q] ֒→ Θ2 [n; q] : [n; q] ∈ Θ2 .

c2 → M be a left adjoint functor into a model category
Corollary 6.3. Let F : Θ
M . Then the following are equivalent:
(i) F is a left Quillen functor;

(ii) F sends each map in I to a cofibration and each map in Hh ∪Hv ∪ e, [id; e]
to a trivial cofibration; and

(iii) F sends each map in I to a cofibration and each map in Hh′ ∪Hv ∪ e, [id; e]
to a trivial cofibration

Proof. (i) ⇒ (iii) follows from Lemmas 3.3 and 4.6, and (iii) ⇒ (ii) follows from
Lemma 4.2.

For (ii) ⇒ (i), suppose that F satisfies (ii). Recall that for any [1; 0] 6= [n; q] ∈ Θ2
and any 1 ≤ k ≤ n satisfying qk = 0, both of Θ2 [n; q] ֒→ Ψk [n; q] and Θ2 [n; q] ֒→
Φk [n; q] are in


cell Hh ∪ Hv ∪ Ψℓ [m; p] ֒→ Φℓ [m; p] : dim [m; p] < dim [n; q]

by Lemmas 3.12 to 3.16. It follows by induction on dim [n; q] that F additionally
sends all vertical equivalence extensions to trivial cofibrations. Thus Theorem 6.1
(and Corollary 6.2) implies that the right adjoint to F preserves fibrant objects and
fibrations between them.
c2 . Since F sends each map in I to a
Now let f be a trivial cofibration in Θ
cofibration, F (f ) is a cofibration. Hence by [9, Lemma 7.14], F (f ) is trivial if and
only if it has the left lifting property with respect to all fibrations between fibrant
objects. The latter follows from the conclusion of the previous paragraph by taking
the adjoint transpose.

7. Teaser: lax Gray tensor product
This section provides a peek into how the combinatorics developed in this paper
will be used in our future work.
In (ordinary) 2-category theory, one can study various lax notions where certain
diagrams are required to commute not on the nose but up to appropriately coherent
comparison 2-cells. An example of such a notion is the (lax ) Gray tensor product
[6, Theorem I.4.9]
⊠ : 2-Cat × 2-Cat → 2-Cat.
If f : a → a′ and g : b → b′ are 1-cells in 2-categories A and B respectively, then
in A ⊠ B the square
(a, b)
(a, g)

(a, b′ )

(f, b)

γf,g

(f, b′ )

(a′ , b)
(a′ , g)

(a′ , b′ )

admits a (not necessarily invertible) comparison 2-cell γf,g , and these γ’s are compatible with the 2-category structures of A and B in an appropriate sense.
The Gray tensor product is an indispensable tool in 2-category theory, and it
is desirable to have an analogous construction in the (∞, 2)-context. For instance,
in their book on derived algebraic geometry [5], Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum listed
and exploited various properties such a tensor product of (∞, 2)-categories should
have (but they did not prove their construction indeed yields a tensor product with
those properties). As we mentioned in the introduction, the content of this paper
was originally developed as a tool for proving the following theorem.
Theorem 7.1. The 2-quasi-categorical Gray tensor product

(defined below) is left Quillen.

This theorem corresponds to Proposition 3.2.6 in [5, Chapter 10], an unproven
result in that book. More precisely, the proposition states that their Gray tensor
product preserves ∞-categorical colimits in each variable. Our Gray tensor product
preserves (1-categorical) colimits in each variable by construction, and Theorem 7.1
allows us to upgrade this preservation property to a homotopical version.
By (the binary version of) Corollary 6.3, this theorem follows if we can prove
that:
ˆ is a cofibration for any f, g ∈ I; and
(i) f ⊗g
ˆ is a trivial cofibration whenever one of f and g is in I and the other
(ii) f ⊗g

is in Hh ∪ Hv ∪ e, [id; e] .
A general proof of these facts will be given in our future paper. In this section, we
sketch the proof for a particular instance of (ii) in order to illustrate the role that
the inner horns will play in that paper.

Remark. For complicial sets (which model (∞, ∞)-categories), a relatively simple
definition of the Gray tensor product was given by Verity in [15, 16], where he also
proved the complicial counterpart of Theorem 7.1 (and much more). One drawback
of complicial sets is that there is only one obvious duality operation, namely the odd
dual induced by the automorphism (−)op on ∆, although one would expect to be
able to reverse the n-cells for any n ≥ 1. On the other hand, for 2-quasi-categories
both the horizontal and vertical duals are easy to describe, but the Gray tensor
product does not admit a concrete description.

this map is at least a cofibration (= monomorphism).
By construction of the Gray tensor product, the codomain Θ2 [2; 0, 0] ⊗ Θ2 [1; 0]
of this map is the nerve of the 2-category that looks like

of Θ2 [2; 0, 0] ⊗ Θ2 [1; 0]. The first part, the cellular subset Λ1h [2; 0, 0] ⊗ Θ2 [1; 0], is
generated by the nerves of the sub-2-categories

We wish to show that X ֒→ Θ2 [2; 0, 0]⊗Θ2 [1; 0] is a trivial cofibration. We separate
the non-degenerate cells in (Θ2 [2; 0, 0] ⊗ Θ2 [1; 0]) \ X into six kinds according to
their “silhouette”. The cells

and

have the same silhouette “ ”, and similarly each of the silhouettes “
“ ” has four cells. There are two cells

and
of silhouette “

and

have silhouette “ ”. We can associate a cut-point (= a point that disconnects
the shape if removed) to each silhouette except for the last one as follows:
,

,

,

and

Observe that the set of non-degenerate cells of these silhouettes can then be parti
k
tioned into pairs of the form φ, φ·δhφ where the kφ -th vertex of φ is the cut-point
k
associated to its silhouette. We can glue such φ to X along Λhφ in increasing order
of dim φ, and then glue the above (1; 2)-cell of silhouette “ ” along Λ1;1
v [1; 2].
This exhibits the inclusion X ֒→ Θ2 [2; 0, 0] ⊗ Θ2 [1; 0] as a member of cell(Hh ∪ Hv )
and hence as a trivial cofibration by Lemma 3.3.
