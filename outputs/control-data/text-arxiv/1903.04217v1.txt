ABSTRACT: The formation of self‐organized laser induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS)
in metals, semiconductors and dielectrics upon pulsed laser irradiation is a well‐known
phenomenon, receiving increased attention due to its huge technological potential. For the
case of metals, a major role in this process is played by surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)
propagating at the interface of the metal with the medium of incidence. Yet, simple and
advanced models based on SPP propagation sometimes fail to explain experimental results,
even of basic features as the LIPSS period. We experimentally demonstrate, for the particular
case of LIPSS on Cu, that significant deviations of the structure period from the predictions of
the standard model are observed, which are very pronounced for elevated angles of laser
incidence. In order to explain this deviation, we introduce a model based on the propagation
of a SPP on a rough surface that takes into account the influence of the specific roughness
properties on the SPP wave vector. Good agreement of the modelling results with the
experimental data is observed, which highlights the potential of this model for the general
understanding of LIPSS in other metals.

INTRODUCTION:
Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) are formed when a material is exposed to
multiple laser pulses at energies above the modification threshold.1–4 The predominant
mechanism giving rise to LIPSS formation is related to the interference of incident laser light
with a wave propagating at the surface, leading to a periodic intensity modulation that is
imprinted into the material.5 LIPSS manifest in metals,6–8 semiconductors9–11 and dielectrics,12–
16
, both organic and inorganic, and can feature different sizes, shapes and orientations that are
determined by a complex interplay of laser irradiation and material parameters. The enormous
richness of structures that can be fabricated in that way in viturally all materials with countless
applications, combined with the inherent simplicity offered by a single‐beam laser fabriaction
approach based on self‐organization, have triggered intense research over the past decades3,17–
21
Amongst the irradiation parameters, the angle of incidence  of the laser beam occupies a
prominent role, since it directly influences the period of the so‐called Low Spatial Frequency
(LSF) LIPSS, consisting of parallel ripples aligned perpendicular to the laser polarization.
Despite the importance of , there are surprisingly few works on systematic studies of this
parameter, and these works are limited to a very narrow selection of materials.2,22–25
For the specific case of metals, the wave propagating at the surface that contributes to ripple
formation is generally identified as a surface plasmon polariton26–29 coupled in from the
incident light with help from a non‐negligible surface roughness. The role of surface roughness
is thus to impart momentum to the incident wave, bridging the momentum mismatch between
the parallel component of the wavevector of such incident wave with that of the SPP, which lies
beyond the light cone.30,31 In fact, the surface roughness parameters play a crucial role in
determining the light‐SPP coupling efficiency.32,33 The emergence of LIPSS is associated to the
formation of a surface wave as a result of the interference between the incident field and the
excited SPP, yielding the well‐known expression of the LIPSS period.34 In general, though, the
role of surface roughness is assumed to be only to allow SPP excitation, and the calculated SPP
wavevector used corresponds to that at a planar dielectric‐metal interface. This approach does
reproduce the general tendency of the LIPPS period as a function of angle of incidence, but
fails to predict correctly the period values.22
In this regard, it should be recalled that SPP propagating along a rough surface can also
couple into outgoing waves.35 More importantly for LIPSS formation, and often overlooked, is
the fact that the SPP itself senses the surface roughness along its propagation. Attempts to
account for this discrepancy have been carried out by considering the rough metal surface in
form of an additional thin layer composed of air and metal, whose dielectric function is
modelled by Maxwell‐Garnett theory of effective media, slightly improving the agreement with
experimental results.22,29 Nonetheless, the surface roughness appears in this model as the metal
filling fraction of such intermediate air‐metal interface, without including in detail surface
roughness statistical parameters.
Here, we report a strong deviation of the angle dependence of the LIPSS period on Cu from
the predictions of all existing models based on SPP propagation. In order to explain the
observed differences, we introduce a model based on the modification of the propagation of
surface plasmon polaritons on a rough surface that incorporates the strong dependence of the
SPP wavevector on surface roughness parameters.36,37 Upon introducing such specific
roughness parameters determined experimentally into the rough‐SPP model, we show that the
experimental LIPSS periods can be properly obtained by the model.

RESULTS:
Laser irradiation experiments have been performed by exposing the Cu sample to a train of
focused ultrashort laser pulses while moving the sample at different speeds. Given the
numerous experimental parameters that influence the formation of LIPSS in metals even for
constant laser pulse properties (800
wavelength, 100
pulse duration, p‐polarization,
100
repetition rate), we have performed several independent irradiation experiments in
order to narrow down the global parameter space. First, we have explored the parameter space
in order to identify the
given by the laser fluence and the effective pulse number
optimum conditions for the formation of LIPSS for a constant angle of incidence ( 0°). We
found that the minimum pulse number necessary for the appearance of reasonably well‐
1000 (cf. experimental section for the
pronounced and aligned LIPSS in Cu was

constant.
In a second step, we varied the angle of incidence while keeping
Figure 1(a‐f ) shows SEM images of the resulting LIPSS for three angles of incidence  0°, 30°
and 52° . Several observations can be made: First, the periodic structures are aligned
perpendicularly to the laser polarization and their period  increases with the angle of
incidence, as expected for low spatial frequency (LSF) LIPSS (so‐called ripples) in metals.
Second, for a given angle, two different ripple periods are observed in different regions of the
laser‐written track. This is particularly evident for the results shown for  52° (cf. Figure
1c,f ), featuring a shorter period towards the center of the track (inner LIPSS) and a longer one
at the border (outer LIPSS). It should be reminded that under the present laser excitation
conditions with a Gaussian‐shaped intensity profile, the center of the track has experienced a
higher local fluence than the border. This position‐dependent, and thus fluence‐dependent
period is astonishing and will be one of the main foci of interest in the present paper.

the result of the simple plasmonic model (see text).
Indeed, it is well known that a change of fluence can lead to different classes of LIPSS in
metals, ranging from high spatial frequency (HSF)‐LIPSS and LSF‐LIPSS at low and moderate
fluence, to so‐called grooves and spikes at high fluence.39 These LIPSS classes differ strongly
from each other in terms of their spatial features, with HSF‐LIPSS having a period of less than
half the laser wavelength and being aligned parallel to the laser polarization, LSF‐LIPSS having
a period similar to the laser wavelength at normal incidence and being aligned perpendicular
to the polarization. Grooves and spikes have both a size much larger than the laser wavelength.
Comparing these known LIPSS classes to our case of two types of ripples sharing the same
orientation (Figure 1a‐f ) leads us to the conclusion that both belong to the same LIPSS class,
namely LSF‐LIPSS. We attribute the absence of other experimental works (to the best of our
knowledge) reporting two types of LSF‐LIPSS to the fact that only few studies at all have
explored the angle dependence of LIPSS. For zero angle the difference in period is small and
close to the experimental resolution, as opposed to elevated angles, where the two types can
clearly be distinguished.
In order to investigate the origin of the two types of LIPSS in more detail we have extended
the study of the angle dependence to cover a range from 0° to 60°. The results are plotted in
Figure 1(g). The most striking observation is that two different periods are present for a single
angle, confirming the observations made in Figure 1(a‐b). While it can be argued that for small
angles the difference in period is negligible, at larger angles the difference is considerable. We
have included in Figure 1(c) data for a period  calculated from simple plasmonic theory,34,40

being the dielectric functions of air and the metal. It can be seen that the
general trend of both periods as a function of  does indeed follow the theory, but the absolute
values differ considerably for both types of LIPSS observed experimentally, being
systematically lower in both cases. It should be noted here that an additional subwavelength
period Λ is predicted by a variation of Eq. (1), in which the minus sign is replaced by a plus
sign. However, in the present case of Cu, we have not found experimental evidence for this
period, whereas we did observe it in our recent work on silicon.24,25
A deviation of experimentally observed period values from values predicted by the simple
plasmonic model as observed in Figure 1(g) is often reported in literature and several
modifications to the model have been proposed. The most widely accepted one is based on a
transient change of the dielectric function of the material during laser irradiation, leading to a
transient increase in the free electron density.27 While this correction is vital for explaining the

4

behavior in semiconductors and dielectrics, for the case of metals with already a high density
of free electrons the expected change is only minor. Another addition to the plasmonic model
is based on taking into account the hydrodynamics taking place after laser‐induced melting.9
Whilst this modification does explain the additional formation of the so‐called groove
structures, with larger size and parallel orientation to the laser polarization, it does not yield a
significant change of the period of the LSF‐LIPSS with respect to the other theories. A further
modification to the simple plasmonic model is based on the fact that LSF‐LIPSS often feature
a nanostructure superimposed to them, in form of randomly distributed nanoparticles. Hwang
et al.22 argue that this fine structure leads to an effective change of the dielectric constant ϵ
and directly influences SPP propagation. The authors introduce this concept in their model in
form of an air‐nanostructure composite layer of a certain thickness and fill factor, which is then
described by the Maxwell–Garnett theory of effective media. They implement this concept by
assigning an effective dielectric function ϵ to the air‐nanostructure composite, replacing ϵ
used in the expression for calculating n. Using this approach, the authors were able to fit their
experimental data by adjusting the volume fraction of the metal inclusions in the composite
“air layer”. In a recent work the same group were able to determine the volume fraction of the
metal inclusions by means of AFM measurements.29
An important point that had been neglected in Refs.22,29 is the fact that the nanostructure
features used for the model input were those of the final structures. However, the relevant
nanostructure for surface plasmon propagation to occur is the one present at the threshold of
LIPSS formation. The formation of LIPSS is based on multiple pulse irradiation during which
the surface topography and morphology evolves as the pulse number increases. During the first
few pulses the surface roughness increases homogeneously, until from a certain pulse number
onwards LIPSS begin to form. Thus, it is the surface roughness at this moment, which is
relevant for calculation of SPP coupling and propagation.
A simple way to investigate the progressive formation of the two types of ripples observed as
the pulse number increases is to write single tracks at different values of

100, the characteristic periodic structures of both, the inner and
outer ripples already begin to emerge. From these results we conclude that an appropriate pulse

Since SEM data provide only access to morphological information, AFM measurements need
to be performed in order to obtain a quantitative study of the surface roughness, which is
required for the model here proposed. Representative AFM maps recorded with a step size

Figure 3(e) shows AFM cross sections of tracks written at different pulse numbers. The region
in which the inner ripples are formed (between the dashed vertical lines in Figure 3(e), as
determined from the SEM images shown in Figure 2) corresponds to the region of strong
ablation with a maximum crater depth of ~1.3  at
1000. In contrast, the outer
ripples are formed in a region of weak ablation. It is worth noting that the AFM measurement
of the track cross section in Figure 3(e) was performed over a 100  scale at a much larger

step size (

) than the one shown in Figure 3(a‐d) (5  scale with
comparison of both types of AFM measurements, of a small area with high resolution versus a
large area with low resolution, reveals that the laser‐induced surface roughness combines
coarse structures superimposed with a fine structure, both for
50 and
1000.
While the strongly hierarchical/multiscale morphology of LIPSS is well‐known and opens
interesting possibilities of fabricating novel surface structures with new funcionalities,17,41 it
poses an enormous challenge for our attempt to understand SPP propagation on such
multiscale surfaces.
MODELLING:
We modeled our system based on the fact that the emergence of LIPSS is associated to the
electromagnetic field modulations resulting from the interference between the incident field
and the excited SPP. Then, the LIPSS period  ‐ dependence on the incident angle can be
obtained from this well‐known expression34,40 shown by Eq. (1) above. In our model, we will
assume that the SPP itself is perturbed by the presence of surface roughness; as a result, its
can be modified, on average, with respect to that for a planar surface k .
wavevector
Bearing in mind that surface roughness is not deterministic, accounting theoretically for the
average dispersion relation of SPP on a randomly rough surface is a complex task. We will take
advantage of the fact that surface roughness precursor of LIPSS is normally much smaller than
the incoming wavelength, so that perturbation theories may hold.36,37 In particular, we will
make use of the expression Eq. (A42) derived in Ref.37 for the roughness‐induced modification
of the SPP wavevector.

correlation length is more subtle, since it accounts for the lateral dimensions of roughness,
which are in turn inversely proportional to the imparted transverse momentum; thus
correlation lengths smaller than the SPP wavelength are usually required to affect more
strongly the SPP wavevector. A sketch of the excitation scenario is shown in Figure 4.

As discussed before (cf. Figure 2), we now consider
formation (
). Without the presence of the additional coarse microstructure, the
,
roughness parameters of the nanostructure listed in Table 1 should be appropriate as the
relevant input parameter for our model. Yet in view of the existence of additional microscale
structures, in particular the ablation crater in the region of the inner ripples, the values listed
in the table are most likely underestimated. Because of this we have preferred to calculate the

8

ripple periods by leaving the surface roughness parameter as fit parameter rather than to use
the
values listed in Table 1. However, we do use the
listed in Table 1, since the lateral
dimensions at the nanoscale are well accounted for through AFM. As mentioned above, finer
lateral dimensions result in higher momentum imparted into SPPs, thus having more impact
than coarser lateral dimensions on the roughness‐induced modification of the SPP wavevector
[see Eq. 3 ]. Figure 5 displays a plot of the period of the two types of ripples, combining the
experimental data already shown in Figure 1 with the results of our model. It can be seen that
the model fits the experimental data very well for all angles, much better than the simple
plasmonic model not taking into account the surface roughness.

The fitted roughness parameters used in these calculations are

(
the nanoscale roughness parameters (

for the outer ripples
and

for the inner ripples) shows that a relatively good
agreement is obtained for the outer ripples whereas a clear underestimation is obtained for the
inner ripples. As explained before, we attribute this poor match to the contribution of
microscale roughness, which is particularly important for the inner ripples due to the presence
of an ablation trench.
In order to visualize in two dimensions the importance of the local surface roughness on the
wavevector of the SPP we show in Figure 5(b,c) a direct comparison of experimental and
modelling results for a fixed angle of incidence,  52°. For the model we have calculated the
instantaneous field intensity distribution of SPPs propagating on a surface with a
heterogeneous roughness, the central stripe having a higher roughness and the outer regions
a lower roughness. This is done in practice by assuming that the SPP wavevector, given by Eqs.
3 and 4 , is different in the inner and outer regions, as obtained with the different surface

9

roughness parameters mentioned above; such SPP wavevectors are thus identical to those used
to fit the LIPSS periods in Figure 5(a). Apart from the inherent local randomness observed in
the real ripples, the agreement in Figure 5(b,c) is remarkable, giving further support to the
assumptions made in our theoretical model.
CONCLUSIONS:
From an experimental point of view, we have observed the co‐existence of two types of
periodic surface structures in copper upon scanning the sample while exposing it to a pulse
train of ultrashort laser pulses at an elevated angle of incidence. The structures can be
distinguished by their relative position and period, with the longer period being located at the
track border and the shorter period being in the track center. Our model based on the
propagation of surface plasmon polarizations on rough surfaces demonstrates that the surface
roughness strongly influences the period of the structures formed. The periods predicted by
the model are consistent with the experimental results for roughness values observed
experimentally, although the hierarchical/multiscale morphology of LIPSS would need to be
taken into account in order to achieve a perfect match.

a half‐waveplate and a polarizing beam splitter cube. A second half‐waveplate is used to set the
polarization of the pulse to p‐polarized at the sample plane. The beam passes through a beam

translation stage to position the sample or move it at a user‐defined constant speed. Since the
laser was operated at a constant pulse repetition rate, the setting of the speed effectively
controlled the effective pulse number per unit area incident on the sample. The effective pulse
