ABSTRACT

MUSE observations of the cluster of galaxies CGr32 (M200 ' 2 × 1014 M ) at z = 0.73 reveal the presence of two massive star
forming galaxies with extended tails of diffuse gas detected in the [O ii]λλ3727-3729Å emission-line doublet. The tails, which have
a cometary shape with a typical surface brightness of a few 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2 , extend up to ' 100 kpc (projected distance)
from the galaxy discs and are not associated to any stellar component. All this observational evidence suggests that the gas has
been removed during a ram-pressure stripping event. This observation is thus the first evidence that dynamical interactions with the
intracluster medium were active when the Universe had only half of its present age. The density of the gas derived using the observed
[O ii]λ3729/[O ii]λ3726 line ratio implies a very short recombination time, suggesting that a source of ionisation is necessary to keep
the gas ionised within the tail.

1. Introduction
Since the seminal work of Dressler (1980) it became evident
that the environment plays a major role in shaping galaxy evolution. High density regions such as rich clusters of galaxies are
mainly composed of early-type objects (ellipticals and lenticulars) while the field is dominated by late-type, star-forming systems. In these dense regions the fraction of quiescent galaxies
increases with decreasing redshift (e.g. Dressler et al. 1997). It
is still unclear which, among the different mechanisms proposed
in the literature - gravitational interactions (Merritt 1983; Byrd &
Valtonen 1990; Moore et al. 1998) or hydrodynamic interactions
with the hot (T ' 107 -108 K) and dense (ρICM ' 10−3 cm−3 , e.g.
Sarazin 1986) intracluster medium (ICM; Gunn & Gott 1972;
Cowie & Songaila 1977; Nulsen 1982; Larson et al. 1980) whose contribution might change at different cosmic epochs, is
at the origin of these observed differences (Boselli & Gavazzi
2006, 2014).
In the local Universe, where high sensitivity multi-frequency
observations are available, allowing the detection of the different stellar components and gas phases (cold, ionised, hot) with a
spectacular angular resolution, it is becoming evident that within
structures as massive as M200 ≥ 1014 M ram pressure stripping
is the dominant process responsible for the quenching of the star
formation activity of disc galaxies (Boselli & Gavazzi 2006).
?
Based on observations made with ESO telescopes at the Paranal
Observatory under programs 097.A-0254, 100.A-0607, 101.A-0282.

The most convincing evidence comes from the recent very deep
observations of nearby clusters using narrow-band filters centred on the Hα Balmer recombination line which revealed the
presence of extended (up to ' 100 kpc) low surface brightness
(Σ(Hα) ' 10−18 erg s−1 cm−1 arcsec−2 ) tails of ionised gas. The
cometary shape of the tails and the lack of any associated diffuse tidal structure rule out any gravitational perturbation which
would affect at the same time the gaseous and the stellar component. This undoubtedly states that the ionised gas tail formed
after the interaction of the galaxy interstellar medium (ISM) with
the ICM. The most striking examples have been found first in the
nearby cluster A1367 by Gavazzi et al. (2001) (see also Boselli
& Gavazzi 2014; Gavazzi et al. 2017; Consolandi et al. 2017)
and are now becoming common in other clusters such as Norma
(Zhang et al. 2013), Coma (Yagi et al. 2007, 2010, 2017; Fossati
et al. 2012; Gavazzi et al. 2018) and Virgo (Yoshida et al. 2002;
Kenney et al. 2008; Boselli et al. 2016a, 2018b,a; Fossati et al.
2018). Tails of stripped material have been observed also in H i
(Chung et al. 2007; Scott et al. 2012), in CO (Jáchym et al. 2013,
2014, 2017), and in X-rays (Sun et al. 2006, 2007, 2010), indicating that the other gas phases can also be perturbed during the
interaction. Ram pressure stripping as the dominant mechanism
is also suggested by the relative distribution in clusters of gas
deficient and star forming galaxies (Gavazzi et al. 2013; Boselli
et al. 2014b), by the outside-in radial truncation of the different
components of the ISM (Cayatte et al. 1990, 1994; Cortese et al.
2010, 2012; Boselli et al. 2014a) and of the star forming disc

(Koopmann et al. 2001; Boselli & Gavazzi 2006; Boselli et al.
2006, 2015; Fossati et al. 2013), and by the abrupt truncation
of the star formation activity of cluster galaxies (Boselli et al.
2016b; Fossati et al. 2018).
The statistical importance of ram pressure stripping, which
is proportional to ρICM V 2 (where V is the velocity of the galaxy
within the cluster and ρICM is the density of the ICM), is expected to reduce at earlier epochs, when clusters of galaxies were
first assembling through the accretion of smaller groups (Gnedin
2003; De Lucia et al. 2012). Here the reduced density of the
ICM and lower velocity dispersion typical of lower mass dark
matter halos would rather have favoured gravitational interactions able to modify the structural properties of the perturbed
galaxies. These gravitationally perturbed objects are probably
the progenitors of massive lenticulars observed in nearby clusters (e.g. Boselli & Gavazzi 2006). The transformation of galaxies at higher redshift via gravitational perturbations in lower density structures before their accretion into massive clusters (preprocessing) is also corroborated by the typical age of the stellar
populations of lenticulars, by their perturbed star formation history, and by their distribution in high-density regions at different epochs (Dressler et al. 1997; Dressler 2004; Poggianti et al.
1999, 2006).
Despite the aforementioned evolutionary picture is now becoming clearer, we still do not know at which epoch and under
which conditions gravitational perturbations are superseded by
hydrodynamic interactions of galaxies with the ICM. Although
massive clusters were significantly less numerous in the past, the
physical conditions encountered by infalling systems were similar to those present in local clusters, characterised by similar
ρICM gas densities (Giodini et al. 2013; McDonald et al. 2017).
It is thus conceivable that ram pressure episodes were already
present at early epochs. Because of obvious observational limits,
direct evidence for ongoing ram pressure stripping at higher redshift is still lacking. Cortese et al. (2007) discovered two galaxies in two clusters at z ' 0.2 with extended tails of star forming
regions, now generally referred to as jellyfish galaxies (e.g. Poggianti et al. 2017). Since then, another ∼ fifty objects with similar
characteristics have been found in deep HST images of clusters
at 0.3 ≤ z ≤ 0.7 (Owers et al. 2012; Ebeling et al. 2014; McPartland et al. 2016). Since selected in the optical bands, however,
where the emission is dominated by stars of intermediate age,
a jellyfish morphology is not a direct proof of an ongoing ram
pressure stripping episode (Cortese et al. 2007). Indeed, in ram
pressure stripped galaxies star formation in the tail is not ubiquitous (e.g. Boselli et al. 2016a), and whenever observed, it is generally localised in very compact H ii regions dominated by young
stellar populations emitting mainly in the UV bands. Extended
and asymmetric low surface brightness structures in the optical
bands are due to tidal tails. The only clear example of galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping at intermediate redshift
comes from deep Subaru narrow-band imaging observations of
the cluster Abell 851 at z=0.4 (Yagi et al. 2015). Indirect evidences at z=0.7 comes from the reduced gas content (Betti et al.
2019) and from the extended Hα ionised gas emission (Vulcani
et al. 2016) observed in galaxies located in high-density regions.
The search for galaxies undergoing a ram pressure stripping
event in high-z clusters is now possible thanks to the advent
of new generation instruments in the radio millimetric and in
the optical domain. The extraordinary sensitivity of ALMA allows the detection of low column density tails of molecular gas
stripped from perturbed cluster galaxies. The results obtained
in the local Universe, however, suggest that the cold gas, once
stripped and in contact with the hot surrounding ICM, rapidly

changes phase becoming ionised via different possible mechanisms such as heat conduction, shocks, or magneto hydrodynamic waves (Tonnesen & Bryan 2010, 2012; Boselli et al.
2016a; Gavazzi et al. 2018). The ionised gas phase can be detected by IFU spectrographs provided that their sensitivity is sufficient to reach surface brightnesses as low as ∼ 10−18 erg s−1
cm−1 arcsec−2 , the typical limiting surface brightness of MUSE
after ∼ 1 h of exposure.
As part of the MUSE Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO),
we have recently undertaken a spectroscopic survey of intermediate redshift (0.25 < z < 0.85) groups and clusters (MAGIC:
MUSE-gAlaxy Groups In Cosmos, Epinat et al. in prep). During
this survey we detected two star forming galaxies in the COSMOS cluster 32 (Knobel et al. 2012) at z=0.73 with extended
(up to ' 100 kpc in projected distance) tails of ionised gas without any stellar counterpart in the deep optical images. This observation is thus the first evidence of an ongoing ram pressure
stripping event at z > 0.5. This paper is structured as follows:
in Sect. 2 we briefly describe the cluster, in Sect. 3 the observations and the data reduction. The analysis of the MUSE data
is given in Sect. 4, and the results are discussed in Sect. 5 and
summarised in the conclusions. We assume a ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 , Ω M = 0.7, and ΩΛ = 0.3.

CGr32
Initially identified as a group, the COSMOS cluster 32 (CGr32;
Knobel et al. 2012) shows properties typical of cluster of galaxies. CGr32 is located at a redshift of z=0.73 and is part of the
COSMOS Wall described by Iovino et al. (2016) (see Fig. 1).
Thanks to the new MUSE observations 105 galaxies have been
identified as cluster members. We determined cluster membership based on the spatial and redshift distributions thanks to a
friends-of-friends algorithm using a linking length of 450 kpc
and a velocity separation of 500 km s−1 (Epinat et al., in prep.).
The cluster has a velocity dispersion of ' 930 km s−1 using all
galaxies detected with MUSE, a radius R200 ' 1.0 Mpc, and a
dynamical mass M200 ' 2.3 × 1014 M inferred from X-rays observations (ID 10220 in Gozaliasl et al. 2019) and is thus comparable to a fairly massive cluster such as Virgo in the local Universe. The fraction of star forming galaxies (∼ 50 %)1 is close
to the typical fraction observed in similar clusters at that redshift
(Dressler et al. 1997) and to that of the spiral-rich Virgo cluster
(48%, Boselli et al. 2014b). The galaxies studied in this work
(ID345 and ID473) are two edge-on spirals located at ' 200-220
kpc from the cluster centre (see Table 2) coherently identified
as the peak of galaxy and of hot gas density in both the MUSE
data (Epinat et al., in prep.) and in the XMM-Newton/Chandra
X-rays data (Finoguenov et al. 2007; George et al. 2011; Gozaliasl et al. 2019, and this work – see Table 1 and Sec 3.2). The
asymmetric velocity distribution of galaxy members and a significantly larger velocity dispersion of the star forming galaxies
(σSF = 1085 km s−1 ) with respect to the quiescent objects (σQ
= 697 km s−1 ) suggest infall into the cluster (Colless & Dunn
1996), as indeed expected for a cluster still in formation (Fig. 2).
The galaxies ID345 and ID473 (Fig. 3) have a relative line-ofsight velocity with respect to the cluster of ∆VID345 = −824 km

The distinction between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is performed from their distribution in the main sequence diagram as suggested by Barro et al. (2017), and consistently with Boselli et al.
(2014b). Stellar masses and star formation rates have been derived as
described in Sect. (3.2).

3.2. Other data

CGr32 is inside the COSMOS field (Scoville et al. 2007) and
has therefore been observed in many bands. We used the HSTACS image of the field observed with the F814W filter for a
morphological analysis of the two galaxies with Galfit (Peng
et al. 2002), while the Subprime/Subaru camera image in the i0 band (Taniguchi et al. 2007), the deepest available for this field
with a limiting surface brightness of 28 mag arcsec−2 , was used
to search for any possible red stellar population counterpart in
the galaxy tails. We also used the XMM-Newton data for the

(2018) for a similar dataset in the COSMOS field with deep imaging data from the UV to the nearIR. Stellar masses and SFR are calculated assuming a Chabrier
(2003) IMF. The spectrum of ID345 exhibits asymmetric shapes
of the emission lines [O iii]λλ4959,5007 and Hβ which could be
explained by a contribution from an AGN. The presence of an
AGN is also suggested by its strong observed radio emission at
1.4 GHz (0.115 mJy - Schinnerer et al. 2010 - corresponding
to a rest frame luminosity L(1.4 GHz) = 4 × 1023 W Hz−1 derived assuming a nonthermal spectral index α = 0.8 - Condon
1992). Should such an AGN indeed be present, this could bias
the SFR derived from SED fitting. For the galaxy ID473, where
the photometry is highly contaminated from a nearby star, the
stellar mass is just a rough estimate. For this galaxy the SFR is
determined using two different methods, the first one from the
Hβ emission line corrected for dust attenuation using the Balmer
decrement, the second one from the observed [O ii] line using the
calibration of Moustakas et al. (2006).

4. Analysis
4.1. Physical properties

The MUSE observations of the cluster reveal the presence of an
extended tail of ionised gas detected in the [O ii] line associated
to the two galaxies ID345 and ID473, as depicted in Fig. 3. The
two tails, which extend from the galaxy discs in the south-east
direction, are 13.400 (97 kpc) and 4.700 (34 kpc) long (projected
distance) and 2.900 (21 kpc) and 2.100 (15 kpc) wide (see Table
2). The deep optical images of the cluster do not show any stellar
counterpart associated to the extended ionised gas tail (Fig. 3)
down to a surface brightness limit of ' 28 mag arcsec−2 in the i0 band. The orientation of the tails, which in both cases is parallel

to the stellar disc major axis, also indicates that the gas stripping
is occurring edge-on. Figure 5 shows the spectra of the galaxies
and of their tails.
We can compare the properties of the tails to those observed
in local galaxies. Unfortunately, at this redshift, the Hα line is
outside the spectral domain of MUSE while Hβ is only barely
detected (1.5-σ detection) in the tail of ID345 and undetected in
ID473, we thus have to derive the intensity of the [O ii] line and
convert it into Hα assuming a standard [O ii]/Hα ratio. Spectroscopic observations of the tails of ionised gas in ram pressure
stripped galaxies of the local Universe are limited to the spectral
domain λ ≥ 4000-9000 Å (Yoshida et al. 2004, 2012; Fossati
et al. 2016; Poggianti et al. 2017), preventing any estimate of
this ratio from local measurement. The only direct measurement
of the [O ii]/Hα ratio in the stripped material of local galaxies is
the value derived by Cortese et al. (2006) around some gravitationally perturbed galaxies in the cluster A1367 ([O ii]/Hα ' 2).
We do not expect that the physical properties of the stripped gas,
which is not associated to any stellar component and is probably
embedded in a similarly hot and dense ICM, differ significantly
from those observed in A1367. This value is consistent with the
value derived using the 1.5-σ detection of Hβ in the tail of ID345
([O ii]/Hβ = 14.6) and the 3-σ upper limit in ID473 ([O ii]/Hβ ≥
4.6) and adopting Hα/Hβ = 2.86 if we make the reasonable assumption that the dust attenuation is negligible. We thus derive
the Hα luminosity assuming [O ii]/Hα = 2 (L(Hα) = 1.3 × 1041
erg s−1 for ID345 and L(Hα) = 2.5 × 1040 erg s−1 for ID473) and
the mean surface brightness of the tails (Σ(Hα) = 1.5 × 10−18 erg
s−1 arcsec−2 for ID345 and Σ(Hα) = 1.3 × 10−18 erg s−1 arcsec−2
for ID473). These numbers, which are close to the detection limits of modern instrumentation, are comparable to those observed
in the nearby Universe. Due to cosmological surface brightness
dimming, however, when transformed to physical units both Hα
luminosities and surface brightnesses are a factor of ∼ 10 higher
than those measured in local systems.
We can also use the [O ii]λ3729/[O ii]λ3726 line ratio to
derive the gas density within the tails. For a mean value of
[O ii]λ3729/[O ii]λ3726 = 1.15 ± 0.06 measured on the integrated spectrum of the tail of ID345, the corresponding electron
density is ne ' 200 cm−3 . As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, however,
this is a light-weighted mean, and is thus probably biased towards the brightest and highest density regions, unresolved in
the MUSE data. Indeed, this gas density perfectly matches that
observed in star forming regions of galaxies at z ' 2 (Sanders
et al. 2016). The typical line ratio measured pixel per pixel in the
diffuse tail is rather [O ii]λ3729/[O ii]λ3726 ' 1.5, corresponding to a gas density ne . 10 cm−3 (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).
This upper limit is consistent with the gas density derived from
the [S ii]λ6716/[S ii]λ6731 line ratio measured in the diffuse tails
of local galaxies, or independently with geometrical considerations (e.g. Fossati et al. 2016; Boselli et al. 2016a). As in Boselli
et al. (2016a) and Fossati et al. (2016), we can also estimate the
typical recombination time of the ionised gas,
τrec =

1
ne αA

(1)

where αA is the total recombination coefficient (αA = 4.2 × 10−13
cm3 s−1 ; Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). For ne = 10 cm−3 , τrec '
104 yr, a very short time compared to the travel time of the tail
(τtravel ' 108 yr).
This very short recombination time suggests that, as in local galaxies, a source of gas excitation within the tail must
be present. In the lack of photoionisation, which requires the

presence of star forming regions within the tail, other ionising
mechanisms can be thermal conduction, magneto hydrodynamics waves, and shocks (Fossati et al. 2016; Boselli et al. 2016a).
The presence of shock-ionised gas is suggested by the high
[O ii]/[O iii]λ5007 ratio observed in the tails ([O ii]/[O iii]λ5007
& 7 and 4.5 in ID345 and ID473, respectively; Dopita & Sutherland 1995). Part of the stripped gas might still be in other phases
such as cold H i or hot gas emitting in X-rays, as indeed suggested by simulations (Tonnesen & Bryan 2010, 2012).

4.2. Kinematical properties

Figure 4 shows the velocity field and the velocity dispersion map
of the ionised gas over the two perturbed galaxies and along the
tails. The velocity field of both galaxies is very symmetric and
the difference between the receding and approaching sides of
both almost edge-on rotating (> 70◦ ) discs is ∼ 300 km s−1 . In
addition, the size of the two galaxies is quite similar, which suggests that they have a comparable dynamical mass (cf. Table 2).
The velocity of the gas is fairly constant along the tails and is
a bit higher than that of the associated galaxies, which means
that the gas is decelerated in the tail, confirming its stripped gas
origin. This difference is higher for the northern galaxy ID473
(∆V ∼ 100 km s−1 ). The low velocities (in blue) associated to a
higher velocity dispersion in the southern tail are due to the overlap of the tail with a galaxy of the cluster with a lower velocity
than the tail (cf. Fig. 3). The velocity dispersion of the gas is high
in the southern galaxy ID345 (∼ 131 km s−1 ) which seems to
host an active galactic nucleus (based on broad lines and a high
[O iii]λ5007/Hβ ratio around 3.5 on the integrated spectrum). It

is lower (∼ 75 km s−1 ) in the northern galaxy ID473, while the
velocity dispersion of the gas along both tails is fairly high (∼
80 km s−1 ). We recall, however, that this is a light-weighted estimate of the velocity dispersion of the gas within the tails. It is
comparable to the median dispersion along tails (∼ 90 km s−1 )
determined on the velocity dispersion map (see Fig. 4), but much
more uncertain due to the low signal-to-noise. Similar velocity
dispersions are observed within the tail of local galaxies (e.g.
ESO 137-001, Fumagalli et al. 2014).

5. Discussion
The presence of long tails of ionised gas without any old stellar
counterpart suggests that the two galaxies are now undergoing a
ram pressure stripping episode. The derived density, mass, and
recombination time of ionised gas stripped during the interaction, as well as the shape and size of the tail associated to the
two galaxies ID345 and ID473, are very similar to those observed in the massive spiral NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster or
ESO 137-001 in the Norma (A3627) cluster. The conditions for
gas stripping via ram pressure, ρICM V 2 > 2πGΣgas Σstar (Gunn &
Gott 1972), where Σgas and Σstar are the density of gas and stars
over the disc of the galaxy, can be compared to those encountered in these nearby counterparts. Indeed, the velocity dispersion of the cluster CGr32 (< Vcluster > ' 930 km s−1 ) is close to
that of Virgo (< Vcluster > ' 800 km s−1 , Boselli et al. 2014b) and
Norma (< Vcluster > ' 925 km s−1 , Sun et al. 2010), where ram
pressure stripping is active.
We use the radial profile of the intracluster electron density,
ne , derived from XMM-Newton data (see Sec.3.2) to estimate ne
at the position of the two target galaxies (Fig. 6). The azimuthal
mean density of the hot intracluster gas at the position of the two
galaxies ID345 and ID473 is ne = 1.7 × 10−3 and ne = 1.6 ×
10−3 cm−3 , respectively. These densities are comparable to those
encountered in similar clusters in the redshift range z=0.7 to z=0
(Giodini et al. 2013; McDonald et al. 2017).
Article number, page 8 of 10

These electron densities can also be compared to that measured in the Virgo cluster at a similar radial distance from the
cluster core (ne ' 2 × 10−3 cm−3 at 100 kpc, ne ' 10−3 cm−3
at 200 kpc), or at the distance of NGC 4569 (ne ' 2 × 10−4
cm−3 at 500 kpc)4 as derived from Suzaku and Planck data by
Simionescu et al. (2017). It can also be compared to that in the
Norma cluster at the distance of ESO 137-001 (ne ' 10−3 cm−3
at 180 kpc, Sun et al. 2010). The conditions encountered by the
galaxies ID345 and ID473 in the cluster CGr32, very similar to
those observed in similar objects in the local Universe, are optimal for an efficient ram pressure stripping event. The gas column
density over the disc of the two galaxies is probably higher than
those present in ESO 137-001 and NGC 4569 , while the stellar density is probably lower just because they are observed at
much earlier epochs (z = 0.7). In particular we recall that NGC
4569 is a bulge dominated Sa galaxy. The relative absolute lineof-sight velocity with respect to the mean velocity of the cluster
are VID345 − < VCGr32 > = −824 km s−1 and VID473 − < VCGr32 >
= −1903 km s−1 . The projected extension of the ionised gas tails
suggests that the galaxies are also moving on the plane of the sky,
thus these values should be considered as lower limits. These
numbers can also be compared to the relative line-of-sight velocity of NGC 4569 with respect to Virgo, VNGC 4569 - < VVirgo > =
1176 km s−1 , ESO 137-001 with respect to Norma, VESO 137−001 < VNorma > = 191 km s−1 , and UGC 6697 with respect to A1367,
VUGC 6697 - < VA1367 > = 132 km s−1 . This simple comparison
suggests that, as in their local counterparts, ID345 and ID473 are
suffering a ram pressure stripping event. It is also worth mentioning that one of the two galaxies, ID345, shows prominent
Balmer absorption lines (see Fig. 5), typical in objects suffering an abrupt variation of the star formation activity. Its position
above the main sequence (at z = 0.7 main sequence galaxies of
M star ∼ 1010 M have star formation rates S FR ∼ 10 M yr−1 ,
Whitaker et al. 2014) suggests that this galaxy might have undergone a moderate starburst phase induced by the compression
of the gas along the disc (e.g. Bekki 2014). The decrease of activity indicated by the prominent Balmer absorption lines might
result after gas ablation, which in a ram pressure stripping event
occurs outside-in and reduce the activity of star formation in the
outer disc, as indeed observed in local galaxies (e.g. Boselli et al.
2006, 2016b; Fossati et al. 2018). We can also mention that the
edge-on orientation of the galaxies on the plane of the sky and
in the direction of the stripping favours the detection of the optically thin ablated gas just for projection effects.
The parallel orientation of the tails of the two galaxies is,
however, striking. It is very unlikely that these two objects are
members of a group and are thus gravitationally interacting
while infalling into the cluster. Indeed, their relative velocity is
very high (VID473 - VID345 = 1079 km s−1 ), thus the duration of
the tidal encounter is too short to induce important modifications
(Boselli & Gavazzi 2006). Furthermore, if both galaxies were
members of the same infalling group, they should be spiralling
around the centre of gravity, producing twisted tails as indeed
observed in the blue infalling group in A1367 (Cortese et al.
2006; Fossati et al. 2019). We remark that both tails are oriented
from the galaxies to the south-east, the same direction of the filamentary structure joining the cluster CGr32 to the COSMOS
Wall (Iovino et al. 2016). This might indicate that both galaxies have been accreted from this structure and have just crossed
the cluster. Their difference in velocity might just indicate that
4

The electron density of the ICM at the distance of NGC 4569 is significantly different than the one reported in Boselli et al. (2016a) which
was based on old ROSAT data.

A. Boselli et al.: Evidence for ram pressure stripping in a cluster of galaxies at z = 0.73

they come from a different region of the COSMOS Wall, which
seems extended several Mpc along the line-of-sight (Iovino et al.
2016).
If the gas keeps the dynamical imprint of the region from
where it has been stripped and is decelerated by the interaction
with the hot ICM, as indeed observed in local edge-on galaxy
UGC 6697 in A1367 (Consolandi et al. 2017), Fig. 4 can be interpreted as follows: in the northern galaxy ID473 the gas is decelerated in the tail with respect to the galaxy, which means that
the trajectory of the galaxy within the cluster is not on the plane
of the sky but it is rather on the line of sight, thus the galaxy
is crossing the cluster from the background. This could explain
why the tail is relatively short compared to that of ID345. Indeed,
in the southern galaxy ID345, the less pronounced velocity offset
between the galaxy and the tail, and the extension of the tail, suggest that the trajectory of the galaxy within the cluster is mainly
on the plane of the sky. The observed large velocities along the
tail may be a due to a combination of gas in the tail being decelerated and gas being stripped from the receding side of the
galaxy. The two galaxies show a relatively high velocity dispersion of the gas both in their discs and in the tails (∼ 100 km s−1 ).
Given their almost edge-on trajectories, this could result from the
contribution of the gas stripped from both the approaching and
receding sides of the rotating disc, whose contribution cannot be
resolved because of beam smearing, as indeed observed in the
edge-on galaxy UGC 6697 in A1367 (Consolandi et al. 2017).
We notice, however, that the velocity dispersion of the gas in the
tail is smaller than the maximal rotational difference between
the two sides of both galaxies (∼ 150-200 km s−1 ). To conclude,
ID345 has probably already passed pericentre, while ID473 is
a fresh infaller as suggested by its position in the phase-space
diagram. Galaxies with properties similar to ID345 (eccentric
position in the phase-space and tails oriented toward the cluster
centre), although unusual, are also present in local clusters (e.g.
NGC 4569, Boselli et al. 2014b, 2016a).
We can also compare the properties of the two galaxies to
the most recent results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and in particular to the predictions of IllustrisTNG (Yun
et al. 2019) which are perfectly tuned for a comparison with our
target since done for galaxies (Mstar ≥ 109.5 M ) and clusters
(1013 M ≤ M200 ≤ 1014.6 M ) of similar mass. These simulations indicate that galaxies with tails of stripped gas due to ram
pressure stripping are frequent in clusters with a redshift z <0.6.
About 30% of the disc galaxies have such a cometary shape in
the gaseous component5 , with a very week dependence on redshift. They also show that these objects are more frequent at intermediate to large clustercentric radii (r/R200 ≥ 0.25, that for the
cluster CGr32 corresponds to ' 250-400 kpc), in galaxies with
a high velocity with respect to the mean velocity of the cluster,
and in more massive clusters. The simulations also show that the
orientation of the tail, which generally traces the trajectory of
the galaxy within the high-density region, does not depend on
the relative position of the galaxy with respect to the cluster centre. We recall that ID345 and ID473 are located at ' 200 kpc in
projection from the cluster core, have the tails oriented almost
towards the cluster centre, and have a high velocity along the
line of sight with respect to that of the cluster, and thus match all
the properties of perturbed galaxies in the simulations.

5

Since these simulations do not discriminate between the different gas
phases, it is not astonishing that the fraction of galaxies with observed
tails in the ionised gas is significantly lower than 30%.

6. Conclusion
As part of the MUSE-gAlaxy Groups In Cosmos (MAGIC) GTO
program we observed the cluster of galaxies CGr32 (M200 ' 2 ×
1014 M ) at z=0.73. The MUSE observations reveal the presence of two massive (Mstar ' 1010 M ) galaxies with extended
low-surface brightness tails of diffuse gas detected in the [O ii]
emission-line doublet. The cometary shape of the tails and the
lack of any diffuse stellar counterpart in the very deep Subaru
images clearly indicate that the two galaxies are undergoing a
ram-pressure stripping event. This result is thus the first evidence
that the dynamical interaction between the cold galaxy ISM with
the hot and dense ICM, which is probably the dominant perturbing mechanism in high density environments in the local Universe, was also active at earlier epochs, when the Universe had
only half of its present age. This result is consistent with the predictions of the most recent cosmological simulations of galaxy
evolution.
The density of the gas within the tail derived using the
[O ii]λ3729/[O ii]λ3726 line ratio indicates that the recombination time, τrec ' 104 yr, is very short compared to the travel time
of the tail, τtravel ' 108 yr, as often observed in local galaxies.
This suggests that a source of gas excitation must be present
within the tail. To conclude, this work is a further confirmation
that the extraordinary IFU capabilities of MUSE in terms of field
of view and sensitivity can be successfully used to extend local
studies to the high redshift Universe, thus opening a new era in
the study of the role of the environment on galaxy evolution.
