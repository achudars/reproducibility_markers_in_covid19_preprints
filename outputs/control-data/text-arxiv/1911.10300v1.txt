Breaking the time-reversal symmetry of light is of great importance for fundamental physics,
and also have attracted increasing interests in the study of non-reciprocal photonics for applications. The optical non-reciprocity has been realized by engineering the susceptibility of dielectric,
through either magneto-optics effect with bias magnetic field or directional coherent nonlinear optical effects stimulated by external drives. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an inherently
non-reciprocal quasiparticle, i.e. the cavity polariton, in a strongly coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics system. Through carefully manipulating the internal quantum state of atoms to break
the time-reversal symmetry, the polariton shows non-reciprocal photon emission without bias field.
Such non-reciprocal polariton state leads to optical isolation exceeds 30dB on single-quanta level
(∼ 0.1 photon), and also produces non-reciprocal non-classical statistics with coherent probe lights,
manifesting the quantum nature of the non-reciprocal polaritons. Such new quasiparticle demonstrated in this work holds great potential for exploring the quantum non-reciprocity in photonics
and quantum network applications, and also new topological phases in many-body physics.

Optical non-reciprocal devices, in which the light propagates asymmetrically when the propagation direction
is reversed, play important roles in photonic information processing [1]. They also allows the realization of
artificial gauge fields for photon, and the simulation of
interesting effects that previously only available for electrons [2, 3]. The non-reciprocity intrinsically relies on the
time-reversal (T) symmetry breaking for photon, which
was traditionally realized via magneto-optics effects by
an external bias DC-magnetic field [4]. However, its application is greatly limited by the material, the precondition of a strong magnetic field, and non-switchable functionality [5]. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted
to the magnetic-field-free optical non-reciprocity [6–15].
One most adopted approach utilizes the coherent nonlinear optical effects, by which the direction-dependent
transmission of the probe light is realized with a coherent external drive from a certain direction or a refractive index modulation with an effective momentum
(p) [6, 10]. The T-symmetry is broken as T pT −1 = −p
with T is the time-reversal operator. The principle of
such mechanism of all-optical non-reciprocity has been
experimentally verified in optomechanics and nonlinear
microresonator platforms [7, 8, 16], requiring milliwatt
bias AC-driving fields.
Alternatively, since T ST −1 = −S for the spin operator S 6= 0, the T-symmetry is naturally broken by preparing spin state of photons with S 6= −S (circular polarization). Therefore, when the photon interacts with the
atom, assisted with the selection rules, the non-reciprocal
transmission of a photon propagating along z-direction
could be realized by preparing the atom to a ground
state with biased spin state Sz , where the external bias
field is not necessary. Very recently, such bias-field-free

non-reciprocal atom-photon interaction has been studied
experimentally with nano-photonic structures, where the
isolation [17] and circulation [18, 19] for single photons
have been demonstrated. However, due to the limited
coupling strength for single atom, the performances of
these devices (∼ 10 dB isolation, saturated for single photons) are greatly limited compared to their commercial
counterparts.
Here, we report the realization of non-reciprocal cavity
polaritons, where the non-reciprocal vacuum Rabi spectra are observed in a cavity quantum electrodynamics
(QED) system with a few atoms strongly coupled to
a micro-sized Fabry-Pérot (FP) cavity. Distinct from

conventional optical non-reciprocity that arises from the
modification of optical susceptibility, the polariton is a
quasi-particle of hybridized light-matter that inherently
breaks the T-reversal symmetry. By optically probing the non-reciprocal polariton, a real sense of singlequanta-level optical diode with isolation over 30 dB and
bandwidth exceeding 10 MHz is realized. Additionally,
the quantum nonlinearity of the polaritons provides the
non-reciprocal quantum statistics, for example, the subPoissonian versus the super-Poissonian photon statistics,
or the bunching versus the antibunching effects, when
probing the system from different directions. Our work
initiates the exploration on the concept of quantum nonreciprocity with conventional quantum optics systems
from two perspectives: preparing the atomic systems
with the quantum superpositions of biased spin states
and utilizing the intrinsic quantum nonlinear effects of
non-reciprocal polaritons.
Figure 1 schematically illustrates the experimental
setup to realize the non-reciprocal cavity polariton. The
kernel is a cavity QED setup with neutral atoms strongly
coupled to an FP cavity [20–22], in which the collective
atom-cavity coupling cooperativity can greatly exceeding
unity. The cavity supports degenerated circularly polarized (σ± ) optical modes. In an ideal case, by preparing the atom on the ground spin state with Sz = −S
and S 6= 0, its couplings to the two circularly polarized photons are maximally unbalanced. As shown in
Fig. 1a, the σ+ -polarized vacuum strongly couples with
the atoms and constitutes the vacuum polaritons, as the
quasi-particles √12 (a+ ± b+ ), whose eigenfrequency is detuned from the bare cavity by ±geff . Here, a+ and b+
denote the bosonic operator of σ+ -polarized cavity mode
and the corresponding collective psudo-spin operator for
atomic transition, respectively, and geff is the effective
coupling strength. Hence, the system shows two polariton states in the spectra (Fig. 1c), and both emit only
σ+ -polarized photons. In contrast, the atoms are transparent to the σ− -polarized photons due to the lacking of
the atomic transitions (Fig. 1b), thus the mode remains
as the bare cavity mode (Fig. 1d). Comparing the two
cases, the T-symmetry is broken for the polariton states.
The T-symmtry breaking of polaritons would break the
Lorentz reciprocity of forward (+z) and backward (−z)
propagating probe lights with polarizations of σ+ and
σ− , respectively. Under the linear approximation [23],

estimate the collective cooperativity C+ = 33.8(0.2) and the

C+ 6= C− , manifesting non-reciprocity of the polaritons.
Our experiments are performed on a cavity QED system by trapping multiple cesium-atom in a micro-sized
high-finesse FP cavity [23]. The intracavity atoms are
prepared into the ground state |6S1/2 , F = 4, mF = −4i,
i.e. the maximally biased spin-state with Sz = −4,
through optical pumping. In order to demonstrate the
non-reciprocal devices, the cavity modes are tuned to
be resonant to atomic transition |6S1/2 , F = 4, mF =
−4i ↔ |6P3/2 , F 0 = 3, mF 0 = −3i. We realized the ideal
case shown in Fig. 1a and1b as only σ+ -mode couples
to the atoms owing to the absence of excited state for
σ− -transition (C− = 0). By probing the system from the
forward and the backward directions with σ+ and σ− po-

larizations, we obtain the typical non-reciprocal vacuum
Rabi splitting spectra, as shown in Fig. 2a. There are two
peaks for polaritons in the forward spectrum, while only
one peak of the bare cavity mode is shown in the backward spectra, which agree with theoretical predictions
(Fig. 1c and 1d). The non-reciprocal polariton is further
verified by the two dimensional spectra (Fig. 2b and 2c)
with atom-cavity detuning ∆ac swept, where the characteristic avoid-crossing spectra for polariton can only be
accessed on +z-direction.
If we focus on the frequency region around the atomic
(or cavity) resonance in Fig. 2a, the probe is blocked forwardly but is transmited through the system backwardly,
thus exhibits the functions of an optical diode. By intro-

4
ducing the optical spin-momentum locking apparatuses,
which consists of polarization beam splitter (PBS) and
quarter wave plate (QWP), the linearly polarized light
would be converted to circularly polarized light with its
spin (σ± ) depending on its propagation direction (±z),
i.e. the probe beam can only be in either (+z, σ+ ) or
(−z, σ− ) states. A reliable optical isolator will be implemented by placing the non-reciprocal cavity polariton
system between them (Fig. 3a). It’s worth to note that
the device is actually a four-port circulator, here we only
use it as an isolator by neglecting the reflection ports of
the two PBSs. The isolation is defined by the transmission ratio I = T− /T+ . Figure 3b presents the measured I
versus the probe detuning (∆) for ∆ac = 0, which shows
both theoretical and experimental isolation over 25 dB at
∆ ∼ 0. Interestingly, isolation of about −10 dB can also
be obtained for probe resonant with the polaritons. The
large I around zero detuning confirms the high performance of the optical isolator based on the non-reciprocal
polariton in our scheme.
From Eq. (1), when ∆ac = ∆ = 0, the ideal isolation
Imax = (1 + 2C+ )2

(2)

would be achieved. Imax quadratically increases with the
cooperativity C+ , and a 30-dB isolation can be achieved
with C+ ≥ 15.3. We comprehensively investigate the performance of the isolator by varying the intracavity atom
number and probe light intensity, and summarized the
results of I in Fig. 3c. For very weak probe power, I increases with C+ as expected. The measured I is slightly
lower than the Imax because of experimental imperfections as well as the background stray light. The measured
isolation can achieve 30 dB in a strongly coupled system
with C+ ∼ 35. At a given C+ , along with the increase of
the probe power, I goes up a little at first due to the improvement of signal-to-noise ratios, but decreases significantly at higher probe power due to the saturation of the
polaritons. These behavior can be clearly observed in the
detailed response of the diode as shown in Fig. 3d and 3e:
The output power linearly increases with the probe power
on −z-direction because of the bare cavity mode; The polaritons blockade the transmission of the weak probe on
+z-direction, and get saturated with stronger probe due
to the anharmonicity of polariton with the finite atom
number [23].
The non-reciprocal polariton is then studied in more
general cases, since the maximally biased spin-state
might not be available in experiments. For example,
as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4a, both the σ+ and σ− -modes of the cavity could strongly couple to
the atomic transition with unequal strengths (C±  0
and C− 6= C+ ). We tune the cavity to be resonant
with |6S1/2 , F = 4i ↔ |6P3/2 , F 0 = 5i and slightly
polarize the atoms so that the atomic populations on
Zeeman sublevels of |6S1/2 , F = 4i state slanted from
mF = −4 to mF = 4. The spectra of the weak probe

is shown in Fig. 4b, where we found that the spectra for σ− - and σ+ -polarized polariton are different not
only with the splitting, but also the spectra of two σ+ polaritons are asymmetric. The asymmetry arises from
the off-resonant coupling between the bare cavity modes
and other hyperfine energy levels (|6P3/2 , F 0 = 4i) of
the atom, which induces an 6 MHz difference of effective mode frequency shifts. Particularly, such dispersive effect is also non-reciprocal and is similar to the
avoid-crossing results for large atom-cavity detuning in
Fig. 2b. In addition to the non-reciprocity of the energy flow, the quantum statistics of the light fields is also
non-reciprocal in the nonlinear regime [23]. The theoretical second-order correlations g (2) (0) of the transmitted
lights are displayed in Fig. 4b. When the probe is nearresonant with the polariton states the emissions of both
σ± -polaritons show similar super-Poissonian distribution
(2)
(2)
(g (2) (0) > 1) with gσ+ (0) 6= gσ− (0). This is because
that the probe only excites one polariton state for both
cases, and the bunching effect is observed due to anharmonicity of polariton on weak excitation. However, more
pronouced non-reciprocity of the quantum statistics occurs around ∆ = 0, where the super-Poissonian distribu(2)
tion (gσ+ (0) > 1) versus the sub-Poissonian distribution
(2)
(gσ− (0) < 1) are expected. The temporal second-order
correlation functions g (2) (τ ) for the σ± -modes at ∆ = 0
are experimentally measured and shown in Fig. 4c. Here,
due to the equivalence between the forward and backward probes and the σ± probe on the same direction,
we investigate the non-classical statistics of cavity polariton by a forwarding probe beam with fixed power.
For the σ+ -polariton, the probe frequency is actually
more close to one polariton state and showing superPoissonian distribution (g (2) (0) ∼ 1.5) and bunching effect (g (2) (0) > g (2) (τ )). On the contrary, the probe is
equally off-resonant with both σ− -polaritons and showing super-Poissonian distribution (g (2) (0) ∼ 0.8) and
anti-bunching effect (g (2) (0) < g (2) (τ )). Additionally,
there are substantial oscillations of the temporal correlation function for both σ± -polaritons. Detailed theoretical analysis reveals the underlying mechanism of the
non-reciprocal quantum statistic of polaritons [23], which
is mainly attributed to the nonlinear coupling between
polariton states and the interplay between the induced
quantum interferences and the intrinsic anharmonicity
of polaritons. These results suggesting that the anharmonicity of polaritons would bring non-reciprocal quantum features, which would extend the concept of nonreciprocal devices to the quantum regime [24].
Our demonstration of non-reciprocal polariton in a
strongly coupled atoms and cavity system opens up a
new perspective for the researches on cavity QED as well
as novel non-reciprocal devices for photonics. At the linear limit, the polaritons as a hybridization of light and
matter can only be accessible optically from certain di-

5
rections, allowing the magnetic-free isolation for photons
with an isolation ratio exceeding 30 dB. The non-classical
properties of non-reciprocal polariton were revealed by
measuring the statistics of the emitted photons, with the
direction-dependent bunching and anti-bunching properties of polariton being observed for the first time, showing
the potential for realizing non-reciprocal nonlinear optics
effects at the single-quanta level. Our demonstration of
a non-reciprocal polariton is inherently a hybrid quantum state of photon and atom, so that superpositions
of reciprocal and non-reciprocal polariton state worth
further investigation. Such quantum non-reciprocal polariton states can also be extended to phonons [25] and
microwave photons [26, 27] by harnessing their coupling
with electron spin ensembles, and could find applications as quantum routers and isolators for quantum networks [28]. Moreover, the system is potential for studying
many-body physics and non-trivial topological phases of
interacting non-reciprocal polaritons [28–30].

correlation function g (2) (τ ) by detecting the emitted photons
from the system, with the probe detuning fixed at 0 MHz. The
error bars correspond to one standard deviation of multiple
repeated measurements.
