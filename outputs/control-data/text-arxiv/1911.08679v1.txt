Differential subalgebras and norm-controlled inversion

In memory of Ronald G. Douglas

Abstract. In this paper, we consider the norm-controlled inversion for differential ∗-subalgebras of
a symmetric ∗-algebra with common identity and involution.

1. Introduction
In [49, Lemma IIe], it states that “If f (x) is a function with an absolutely convergent Fourier series,
which nowhere vanishes for real arguments, 1/f (x) has an absolutely convergent Fourier series.” The
above statement is now known as the classical Wiener’s lemma.
We say that a Banach space A with norm k · kA is a Banach algebra if it has operation of
multiplications possessing the usual algebraic properties, and
kABkA ≤ KkAkA kBkA for all A, B ∈ A,

(1.1)

where K is a positive constant. Given two Banach algebras A and B such that A is a Banach subalgebra
of B, we say that A is inverse-closed in B if A ∈ A and A−1 ∈ B implies A−1 ∈ A. Inverse-closedness
is also known as spectral invariance, Wiener pair, local subalgebra, etc [13, 16, 30, 46]. Let C be the
algebra of all periodic continuous functions under multiplication, and W be its Banach subalgebra of
all periodic functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series,

Then the classical Wiener’s lemma can be reformulated as that W is an inverse-closed subalgebra of C.
Due to the above interpretation, we also call the inverse-closed property for a Banach subalgebra A as
Wiener’s lemma for that subalgebra. Wiener’s lemma for Banach algebras of infinite matrices and integral operators with certain off-diagonal decay can be informally interpreted as localization preservation
under inversion. Such a localization preservation is of great importance in applied harmonic analysis,
numerical analysis, optimization and many mathematical and engineering fields [2, 10, 11, 23, 28, 44].
The readers may refer to the survey papers [18, 27, 37], the recent papers [14, 34, 36] and references
therein for historical remarks and recent advances.
Given an element A in a Banach algebra A with the identity I, we define its spectral set σA (A)
and spectral radius ρA (A) by

σA (A) := λ ∈ C : λI − A is not invertible in A
and


ρA (A) := max |λ| : λ ∈ σA (A)

respectively. Let A and B be Banach algebras with common identity I and A be a Banach subalgebra
of B. Then an equivalent condition for the inverse-closedness of A in B is that the spectral set of any
A ∈ A in Banach algebras A and B are the same, i.e.,
σA (A) = σB (A).
By the above equivalence, a necessary condition for the inverse-closedness of A in B is that the spectral
radius of any A ∈ A in the Banach algebras A and B are the same, i.e.,
ρA (A) = ρB (A).

(1.3)

The above necessary condition is shown by Hulanicki [24] to be sufficient if we further assume that A
and B are ∗-algebras with common identity and involution, and that B is symmetric. Here we say that
a Banach algebra B is a ∗-algebra if there is a continuous linear involution ∗ on B with the properties
that
(AB)∗ = B ∗ A∗ and A∗∗ = A for all A, B ∈ B,
and that a ∗-algebra B is symmetric if
σA (A∗ A) ⊂ [0, ∞) for all A ∈ B.
The spectral radii approach (1.3), known as the Hulanicki’s spectral method, has been used to establish
the inverse-closedness of symmetric ∗-algebras [9, 20, 21, 41, 43, 45], however the above approach does
not provide a norm estimate for the inversion, which is crucial for many mathematical and engineering
applications.
To consider norm estimate for the inversion, we recall the concept of norm-controlled inversion
of a Banach subalgebra A of a symmetric ∗-algebra B, which was initiated by Nikolski [31] and coined
by Gröchenig and Klotz [20]. Here we say that a Banach subalgebra A of B admits norm-controlled
inversion in B if there exists a continuous function h from [0, ∞) × [0, ∞) to [0, ∞) such that

(1.4)
kA−1 kA ≤ h kAkA , kA−1 kB
for all A ∈ A being invertible in B [19, 20, 34, 36].
The norm-controlled inversion is a strong version of Wiener’s lemma. The classical Banach algebra
W in (1.2) is inverse-closed in the algebra C of all periodic continuous functions [49], however it does not
have norm-controlled inversion in C [5, 31]. To establish Wiener’s lemma, there are several methods,
including the Wiener’s localization [49], the Gelfand’s technique [16], the Brandenburg’s trick [9], the
Hulanicki’s spectral method [24], the Jaffard’s boot-strap argument [25], the derivation technique [21],
and the Sjöstrand’s commutator estimates [36, 39]. In this paper, we will use the Brandenburg’s trick
to establish norm-controlled inversion of a differential ∗-subalgebra A of a symmetric ∗-algebra B.
This introduction article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall the concept of differential
subalgebras and present some differential subalgebras of infinite matrices with polynomial off-diagonal
decay. In Section 3, we introduce the concept of generalized differential subalgebras and present some
generalized differential subalgebras of integral operators with kernels being Hölder continuous and
having polynomial off-diagonal decay. In Section 4, we use the Brandenburg’s trick to establish normcontrolled inversion of a differential ∗-subalgebra of a symmetric ∗-algebra, and we conclude the
section with two remarks on the norm-controlled inversion with the norm control function bounded
by a polynomial and the norm-controlled inversion of nonsymmetric Banach algebras.

2. Differential Subalgebras
Let A and B be Banach algebras such that A is a Banach subalgebra of B. We say that A is a
differential subalgebra of order θ ∈ (0, 1] in B if there exists a positive constant D0 := D0 (A, B, θ) such
that

The concept of differential subalgebras of order θ was introduced in [7, 26, 32] for θ = 1 and [12, 20, 36]
for θ ∈ (0, 1). We also refer the reader to [3, 15, 19, 20, 21, 25, 33, 34, 41, 42, 43, 45] for various
differential subalgebras of infinite matrices, convolution operators, and integral operators with certain
off-diagonal decay.
For θ = 1, the requirement (2.1) can be reformulated as
kABkA ≤ D0 kAkA kBkB + D0 kAkB kBkA

for all A, B ∈ A.

(2.2)

So the norm k · kA satisfying (2.1) is also referred as a Leibniz norm on A.
Let C[a, b] be the space of all continuous functions on the interval [a, b] with its norm defined by
kf kC[a,b] = sup |f (t)|, f ∈ C[a, b],
t∈[a,b]
k

and C [a, b], k ≥ 1, be the space of all continuously differentiable functions on the interval [a, b] up to
order k with its norm defined by
khkC k [a,b] =

k
X

kh(j) kC[a,b] for h ∈ C k [a, b].

k

Clearly, C[a, b] and C [a, b] are Banach algebras under function multiplication. Moreover
kh1 h2 kC 1 [a,b]

= k(h1 h2 )′ kC[a,b] + kh1 h2 kC[a,b]
≤ kh′1 kC[a,b] kh2 kC[a,b] + kh1 kC[a,b] kh′2 kC[a,b] + kh1 kC[a,b] kh2 kC[a,b]
≤ kh1 kC 1 [a,b] kh2 kC[a,b] + kh1 kC[a,b] kh2 kC 1 [a,b] for all h1 , h2 ∈ C 1 [a, b],

(2.3)

where the second inequality follows from the Leibniz rule. Therefore we have
Theorem 2.1. C 1 [a, b] is a differential subalgebra of order one in C[a, b].
Due to the above illustrative example of differential subalgebras of order one, the norm k · kA
satisfying (2.1) is also used to describe smoothness in abstract Banach algebra [7].
Let W 1 be the Banach algebra of all periodic functions such that both f and its derivative f ′
belong to the Wiener algebra W, and define the norm on W 1 by

n∈Z f (n)e

Theorem 2.2. W 1 is a differential subalgebra of order one in W.
Recall from the classical Wiener’s lemma that W is an inverse-closed subalgebra of C, the algebra
of all periodic continuous functions under multiplication. This leads to the following natural question:
Question 2.3. Is W 1 a differential subalgebra of C?
Let ℓp , 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, be the space of all p-summable sequences on Z with norm denoted by k · kp .
To answer the above question, we consider Banach algebras C, W and W 1 in the “frequency domain”.
Let B(ℓp ) be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on ℓp , 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, and let

k∈Z

be Banach algebras of Laurent matrices with symbols in W and W 1 respectively. Then the classical
Wiener’s lemma can be reformulated as that W̃ is an inverse-closed subalgebra of B(ℓ2 ), and an
equivalent statement of Theorem 2.2 is that W̃ 1 is a differential subalgebra of order one in W̃. Due to
the above equivalence, Question 2.3 in the “frequency domain” becomes whether W 1 is a differential
3

subalgebra of order θ ∈ (0, 1] in C. In [45], the first example of differential subalgebra of infinite
matrices with order θ ∈ (0, 1) was discovered.
Theorem 2.4. W 1 is a differential subalgebra of C with order 2/3.
To consider differential subalgebras of infinite matrices in the noncommutative setting, we introduce three noncommutative Banach algebras of infinite matrices with certain off-diagonal decay.
Given 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and α ≥ 0, we define the Gröchenig-Schur family of infinite matrices by

Observe that kAkAp,α = kAkCp,α for a Laurent matrix A = (a(i − j))i,j∈Z . Then Banach algebras
W̃ and W̃ 1 in (2.5) and (2.6) are the commutative subalgebra of the Gröchenig-Schur algebra A1,α
and the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sjöstrand algebra C1,α for α = 0, 1 respectively,
W̃ = A1,0 ∩ L = C1,0 ∩ L

(2.16)

and
W̃ 1 = A1,1 ∩ L = C1,1 ∩ L,
(2.17)
where L is the set of all Laurent matrices A = (a(i − j))i,j∈Z . The sets Ap,α , Cp,α , Bp,α with p = 1
and α = 0 are noncommutative Banach algebras under matrix multiplication, the Baskakov-GohbergSjöstrand algebra C1,0 and the Beurling algebra B1,0 are inverse-closed subalgebras of B(ℓ2 ) [4, 8,
17, 39, 41], however the Schur algebra A1,0 is not inverse-closed in B(ℓ2 ) [47]. We remark that the
inverse-closedness of the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sjöstrand algebra C1,0 in B(ℓ2 ) can be understood as a
noncommutative extension of the classical Wiener’s lemma for the commutative subalgebra W̃ of
Laurent matrices in B(ℓ2 ).
For 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and α > 1 − 1/p, one may verify that the Gröchenig-Schur family Ap,α ,
the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sjöstrand family Cp,α and the Beurling family Bp,α of infinite matrices form
Banach algebras under matrix multiplication and they are inverse-closed subalgebras of B(ℓ2 ) [22, 25,
41, 43, 45]. In [41, 43, 45], their differentiability in B(ℓ2 ) is established.

Theorem 2.5. Let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and α > 1 − 1/p. Then Ap,α , Cp,α and Bp,α are differential subalgebras
of order θ0 = (α + 1/p − 1)/(α + 1/p − 1/2) ∈ (0, 1) in B(ℓ2 ).
Proof. The following argument about differential subalgebra property for the Gröchenig-Schur algebra
Ap,α , 1 < p < ∞, is adapted from [45]. The reader may refer to [41, 43, 45] for the detailed proof to the
differential subalgebra property for the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sjöstrand algebra Cp,α and the Beurling
algebra Bp,α . Take A = (a(i, j))i,j∈Z and B = (b(i, j))i,j∈Z ∈ Ap,α , and write C = AB = (c(i, j))i,j∈Z .

The argument used in the proof of Theorem 2.5 involves a triplet of Banach algebras Ap,α , A1,0

general Banach algebra triplets (A, M, B).
Theorem 2.6. Let A, M and B be Banach algebras such that A is a Banach subalgebra of M and M
is a Banach subalgebra of B. If there exist positive exponents θ0 , θ1 ∈ (0, 1] and absolute constants

Following the argument used in (2.3), we can show that C 2 [a, b] is a differential subalgebra of
C 1 [a, b]. For any distinct x, y ∈ [a, b] and f ∈ C 2 [a, b], observe that
|f ′ (x)| =

in C[a, b].
We finish the section with the proof of Theorem 2.4.
Proof of Theorem 2.4. The conclusion follows from (2.17) and Theorem 2.5 with p = 1 and α = 1. 

3. Generalized differential subalgebras
By (2.1), a differential subalgebra A satisfies the Brandenburg’s requirement:
θ
kA2 kA ≤ 2D0 kAk2−θ
A kAkB , A ∈ A.

(3.1)

To consider the norm-controlled inversion of a Banach subalgebra A of B, the above requirement (3.1)
could be relaxed to the existence of an integer m ≥ 2 such that the m-th power of elements in A
satisfies
kAm kA ≤ DkAkm−θ
kAkθB , A ∈ A,
(3.2)
A
where θ ∈ (0, m − 1] and D = D(A, B, m, θ) is an absolute positive constant, see Theorem 4.1 in the
next section. For h ∈ C 1 [a, b] and m ≥ 2, we have
khm kC 1 [a,b] = mkhm−1 h′ kC[a,b] + khm kC[a,b] ≤ mkhkC 1 [a,b] khkm−1
C[a,b] ,
and hence the differential subalgebra C 1 [a, b] of C[a, b] satisfies (3.2) with θ = m − 1. In this section,
we introduce some sufficient conditions so that (3.2) holds for some integer m ≥ 2.
Theorem 3.1. Let A, M and B be Banach algebras such that A is a Banach subalgebra of M and M
is a Banach subalgebra of B. If there exist an integer k ≥ 2, positive exponents θ0 , θ1 , and absolute

Therefore the assumptions (3.3) and (3.4) in Theorem 3.1 are satisfied for the Banach algebra triplet
(A, M, B) in Theorem 2.6.
For a differential subalgebra A of order θ0 in B, we observe that the requirements (3.3) and (3.4)
with M = B, k = 2 and θ1 = 2 are met, and hence (3.2) holds for m = 4 and θ = 2θ0 . Recall that B
is a trivial differential subalgebra of B. In the following corollary, we can extend the above conclusion
to arbitrary differential subalgebras M of B.
Corollary 3.2. Let A, M and B be Banach algebras such that A is a differential subalgebra of order θ0
in M and M is a differential subalgebra of order θ1 in B. Then (3.2) holds for m = 4 and θ = θ0 θ1 .
Following the argument used in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we can show that (3.2) holds for m = 4

4. Brandenburg trick and norm-controlled inversion
Let A and B are ∗-algebras with common identity and involution, and let B be symmetric. In this
section, we show that A has norm-controlled inversion in B if it meets the Brandenburg requirement
(3.2).
Theorem 4.1. Let B be a symmetric ∗-algebra with its norm k · kB being normalized in the sense that
(1.1) holds with K = 1,
kÃB̃kB ≤ kÃkB kB̃kB , Ã, B̃ ∈ B,
(4.1)
and A be a ∗-algebra with its norm k · kA being normalized too,
kABkA ≤ kAkA kBkA , A, B ∈ A.

(4.2)

If A is a ∗-subalgebra of B with common identity I and involution ∗, and the pair (A, B) satisfies the
Brandenburg requirement (3.2), then A has norm-controlled inversion in B. Moreover, for any A ∈ A
being invertible in B we have

For m = 2, the estimate (4.3) to the inverse A−1 ∈ A is essentially established in [19, 20]
for θ = 1 and [36, 40] for θ ∈ (0, 1), and a similar estimate is given in [34]. The reader may refer
to [15, 21, 42, 43, 45] for norm estimation of the inverse of elements in Banach algebras of infinite
matrices and integral operators with certain off-diagonal decay.
Remark 4.2. A good estimate for the norm control function h in the norm-controlled inversion (1.4) is
important for some mathematical and engineering applications. For an element A ∈ A with A−1 ∈ B,
we obtain the following estimate from Theorem 4.1:

ab
exp C ln a ln ln a
where C is an absolute constant independent of A and

t1 = (ln b)ln m/(ln m−ln(m−θ)) (ln a)− ln(m−θ)/(ln m−ln(m−θ)) .
We remark that the above norm estimate to the inversion is far away from the optimal estimation for
our illustrative differential subalgebra C 1 [a, b]. In fact, give any f ∈ C 1 [a, b] being invertible in C[a, b],
we have
k1/f kC 1[a,b] ≤ kf ′ kC[a,b] kf −1 k2C[a,b] + k1/f kC[a,b] ≤ k1/f k2C[a,b]kf kC 1 [a,b] .
Therefore C 1 [a, b] has norm-controlled inversion in C[a, b] with the norm control function h(s, t) in
(1.4) being h(s, t) = st2 . Gröchenig and Klotz first considered norm-controlled inversion with the norm
control function h having polynomial growth, and they show in [19] that the Baskakov-GohbergSjöstrand algebra C1,α , α > 0 and the Jaffard algebra Jα , α > 1 have norm-controlled inversion in
B(ℓ2 ) with the norm control function h bounded by a polynomial. In [36], we proved that the Beurling
algebras Bp,α with 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and α > 1−1/p admit norm-controlled inversion in B(ℓ2 ) with the norm
control function bounded by some polynomials. Following the commutator technique used in [36, 39],
we can establish a similar result for the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sjöstrand algebras Cp,α with 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞
and α > 1 − 1/p.
Theorem 4.3. Let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and α > 1 − 1/p. Then the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sjöstrand algebra Cp,α
and the Beurling algebra Bp,α admit norm-controlled inversion in B(ℓ2 ) with the norm control function
bounded by a polynomial.
It is still unknown whether Gröchenig-Schur algebras Ap,α , 1 ≤ p < ∞, α > 1 − 1/p, admit normcontrolled inversion in B(ℓq ), 1 ≤ q < ∞, with the norm control function bounded by a polynomial. In
[19], Gröchenig and Klotz introduce a differential operator D on a Banach algebra and use it to define
a differential ∗-algebra A of a symmetric ∗-algebra B, which admits norm-controlled inversion with
the norm control function bounded by a polynomial. However, the differential algebra in [19] does
not include the Gröchenig-Schur algebras Ap,α , the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sjöstrand algebra Cp,α and the
Beurling algebra Bp,α with 1 ≤ p < ∞ and α > 1 − 1/p. It could be an interesting problem to extend
the conclusions in Theorem 4.3 to general Banach algebras such that the norm control functions in
the norm-controlled inversion have polynomial growth.
∗
Remark 4.4. A crucial step in the proof of Theorem 4.1 is to introduce B := I − kA∗ Ak−1
B A A ∈ A,
whose spectrum is contained in an interval on the positive real axis. The above reduction depends on
the requirements that B is symmetric and both A and B are ∗-algebras with common identity and
involution. For the applications to some mathematical and engineering fields, the widely-used algebras
B of infinite matrices and integral operators are the operator algebras B(ℓp ) and B(Lp ), 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞,
which are symmetric only when p = 2. In [1, 15, 36, 38, 42, 48], inverse-closedness of localized matrices
and integral operators in B(ℓp ) and B(Lp ), 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, are discussed, and in [14], Beurling algebras
Bp,α with 1 ≤ p < ∞ and α > d(1 − 1/p) are shown to admit polynomial norm-controlled inversion
in nonsymmetric algebras B(ℓp ), 1 ≤ p < ∞. It is still widely open to discuss Wiener’s lemma and
norm-controlled inversion when B and A are not ∗-algebras and B is not a symmetric algebra.
