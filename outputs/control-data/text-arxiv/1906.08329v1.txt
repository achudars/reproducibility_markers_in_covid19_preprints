Abstract. We study the semigroup extension Iλn (S) of a semigroup S by symmetric inverse semigroups of a
bounded finite rank. We describe idempotents and regular elements of the semigroups Iλn (S) and Iλn (S) show that
the semigroup Iλn (S) (Iλn (S)) is regular, orthodox, inverse or stable if and only if so is S. Green’s relations are
described on the semigroup Iλn (S) for an arbitrary monoid S. We introduce the conception of a semigroup with
strongly tight ideal series, and proved that for any infinite cardinal λ and any positive integer n the semigroup
Iλn (S) has a strongly tight ideal series provides so has S. At the finish we show that for every compact Hausdorff
c
semitopological monoid (S, τS ) there exists a unique its compact topological extension (Iλn (S), τI
) in the class of
Haudorff semitopological semigroups.

1. Introduction, motivation and main definitions
In this paper we shall follow the terminology of [11, 31].
If S is a semigroup, then by E(S) we denote the subset of all idempotents of S. On the set of idempotents
E(S) there exists the natural partial order: e 6 f if and only if ef = f e = e.
A semigroup S is called:
• regular, if for every a ∈ S there exists an element b in S such that a = aba;
• orthodox, if S is regular and E(S) is a subsemigroup of S;
• inverse if every a in S possesses an unique inverse, i.e. if there exists an unique element a−1 in S such
that
aa−1 a = a
and
a−1 aa−1 = a−1 .
It is obvious that every inverse semigroup is orthodox and every orthodox semigroup is regular. A map which
associates to any element of an inverse semigroup its inverse is called the inversion.
Let λ be an arbitrary non-zero cardinal. A map α from a subset D of λ into λ is called a partial transformation
of X. In this case the set D is called the domain of α and is denoted by dom α. Also, the set {x ∈ X : yα =
x for some y ∈ Y } is called the range of α and is denoted by ran α. The cardinality of ran α is called the rank of
α and denoted by rank α. For convenience we denote by ∅ the empty transformation, that is a partial mapping
with dom ∅ = ran ∅ = ∅.
Let Iλ denote the set of all partial one-to-one transformations of λ together with the following semigroup
operation:
x(αβ) = (xα)β

if

x ∈ dom(αβ) = {y ∈ dom α : yα ∈ dom β},

for

α, β ∈ Iλ .

The semigroup Iλ is called the symmetric inverse semigroup over the cardinal λ (see [11]). The symmetric inverse
semigroup was introduced by V. V. Wagner [33] and it plays a major role in the theory of semigroups.
Put
Iλ∞ = {α ∈ Iλ : rank α is finite} and Iλn = {α ∈ Iλ : rank α 6 n},
for n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Obviously, Iλ∞ and Iλn (n = 1, 2, 3, . . .) are inverse semigroups, Iλ∞ is an ideal of Iλ , and
Iλn is an ideal of Iλ∞ , for each n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Further, we shall call the semigroup Iλ∞ the symmetric inverse
semigroup of finite transformations and Iλn the symmetric inverse semigroup of finite transformations of the rank
6 n. The elements of semigroups Iλ∞ and Iλn are called finite one-to-one transformations (partial bijections) of
the cardinal λ. By

we denote a partial one-to-one transformation which maps x1 onto y1 , . . ., xn onto yn , and by 0 the empty
transformation. Obviously, in such case we have xi 6= xj and yi 6= yj for i 6= j (i, j = 1, . . . , n). The empty partial
map ∅ : λ ⇀ λ we denote by 0. It is obvious that 0 is zero of the semigroup Iλn .
Let λ be a non-zero cardinal. On the set Bλ = (λ × λ) ∪ {0}, where 0 ∈
/ λ × λ, we define the semigroup operation
“ · ” as follows

(a, d), if b = c;
(a, b) · (c, d) =
0,
if b 6= c,
and (a, b) · 0 = 0 · (a, b) = 0 · 0 = 0 for a, b, c, d ∈ λ. The semigroup Bλ is called the semigroup of λ × λ-matrix
units (see [11]). Obviously, for any cardinal λ > 0, the semigroup of λ × λ-matrix units Bλ is isomorphic to Iλ1 .
Let S be a semigroup with zero and λ be a non-zero cardinal. We define the semigroup operation on the set
Bλ (S) = (λ × S × λ) ∪ {0} as follows:

(α, ab, δ), if β = γ;
(α, a, β) · (γ, b, δ) =
0,
if β 6= γ,

and (α, a, β) · 0 = 0 · (α, a, β) = 0 · 0 = 0, for all α, β, γ, δ ∈ λ and a, b ∈ S. If S = S 1 then the semigroup Bλ (S) is
called the Brandt λ-extension of the semigroup S [15, 19]. Obviously, if S has zero then J = {0} ∪ {(α, 0S , β) : 0S
is the zero of S} is an ideal of Bλ (S). We put Bλ0 (S) = Bλ (S)/J and the semigroup Bλ0 (S) is called the Brandt
λ0 -extension of the semigroup S with zero [22].
A topological (inverse) semigroup is a Hausdorff topological space together with a continuous semigroup operation (and an inversion, respectively). A semitopological semigroup is a Hausdorff topological space together with
a separately continuous semigroup operation.
The Brandt λ-extension Bλ (S) (or the Brandt λ0 -extension Bλ0 (S)) of a semigroup S we may to consider as
a some semigroup extension of the semigroup S by the semigroup λ × λ-matrix units Bλ . An analogue of so
extension gives the following definition.
2. The construction of of the semigroup extension Iλn (S)
In this paper using the semigroup Iλn we propose the following semigroup extension.
Construction 2.1. Let S be a semigroup, λ be a non-zero cardinal, n and k be a positive integers such that
k 6 n 6 λ. We identify every element α ∈ Iλn with its graph Gr(α) ⊂ λ × λ and put
Iλn (S) = {αS : Gr(α) → S : α ∈ Iλn }
and every map from the empty map 0 into S we identify with the empty map ∅ : λ × λ ⇀ S and denote its by 0.
An arbitrary element 0 6= rank α 6 n we denote by

, and ((x1 , y1 )) α = s1 , . . . , ((xk , yk )) α = sk . Also for αS ∈ Iλn (S) such that

αS =

we denote d(αS ) = {x1 , . . . , xk } and r(αS ) = {y1 , . . . , yk }.
Now, we define a binary operation “·” on the set Iλn (S) in the following way:
(i) αS · 0 = 0 · αS = 0 · 0 = 0 for every αS ∈ Iλn (S);
(ii) if α · β = 0 in Iλn then αS · βS = 0 for any αS , βS ∈ Iλn (S);

Simple verifications show that so defines binary operation on Iλn (S) is associative and hence Iλn (S) is a
semigroup. It is obvious that Iλ1 (S) is isomorphic to the Brandt λ-extension Bλ (S) of the semigroup S.
We remark that if the semigroup S contains a zero 0S then

is an ideal of Iλn (S).
Also, we define a binary relation ≡0 on the semigroup Iλn (S) in the following way. For αS , βS ∈ Iλn (S) we put
αS ≡0 βS if and only if at least one of the following conditions holds:
(1) αS = βS ;
(2) αS , βS ∈ J0 ;
(3) αS , βS ∈
/ J0 and each of conditions
(i) (x, y)αS is determined and (x, y)αS 6= 0S ; and
(ii) (x, y)βS is determined and (x, y)βS 6= 0S
implies the equality (x, y)αS = (x, y)βS .
It is obvious that ≡0 is an equivalence relation on the semigroup Iλn (S).
The following proposition prove by usual verifications.
Proposition 2.2. The relation ≡0 is a congruence on the semigroup Iλn (S).
We define Iλn (S) = Iλn (S)/≡0 .
In this paper we study algebraic properties of the semigroups Iλn (S) and Iλn (S). We describe idempotents
and regular elements of the semigroups Iλn (S) and Iλn (S) show that the semigroup Iλn (S) (Iλn (S)) is regular,
orthodox, inverse or stable if and only if so is S. Green’s relations are described in the semigroup Iλn (S) for an
arbitrary monoid S. We introduce the conception of a semigroup with strongly tight ideal series, and proved that
for any infinite cardinal λ and any positive integer n the semigroup Iλn (S) has a strongly tight ideal series provides
so has S. At the finish we show that for every compact
 Hausdorff semitopological monoid (S, τS ) there exists a
unique its compact topological extension Iλn (S), τIc in the class of Haudorff semitopological semigroups.
3. Algebraic properties of the semigroup extensions Iλn (S) and Iλn (S)

The following proposition describes the subset of idempotents of the semigroup Iλn (S).

Proposition 3.1. For every positive integer i 6 n a non-zero element αS =

of the semigroup

Iλn (S) is an idempotent if and only if a1 = b1 , . . . , ai = bi and s1 , . . . , si ∈ E(S).
Proof. The implication (⇐) is trivial.
(⇒) Suppose that αS ·αS = αS . Then the definition of the semigroup Iλn (S) implies that the symbols a1 , . . . , ai
are distinct. Similar we get that the symbols b1 , . . . , bi are distinct, too. The above arguments and the equality
αS · αS = αS imply that {a1 , . . . , ai } = {b1 , . . . , bi }. Assume that ak 6= bk = al for some integers k, l ∈ {1, . . . , i},
k 6= l. Then we have that al 6= bl 6= bk , which contradicts the equality αS · αS = αS . The obtained contradiction
implies the equalities a1 = b1 , . . . , ai = bi . Now, we get that

and hence s1 s1 = s1 , . . . , si si = si . This completes the proof if the proposition.
Proposition 3.2. For every positive integer i 6 n a non-zero element αS =
Iλn (S) is regular if and only if so are s1 , . . . , si in S.
Proof. The implication (⇐) is trivial. Indeed, αS = αS βS αS for βS =

{b1 , . . . , bi } ⊆ {c1 , . . . , ck } and hence k > i. Without loss of generality we may assume that b1 = c1 , . . . , bi = ci .
Then the equality αS = αS · βS · αS and the semigroup operation of Iλn (S) imply that d1 = a1 , . . . , di = ai and
hence we have that

Two elements a and b of a semigroup S are said to be inverses of each other if
aba = a

and

bab = b.

The definition of the semigroup operation in Iλn (S) implies the following proposition.
Proposition 3.3. Let λ be a non-zero cardinal, n and i be any positive integers such that i 6 n 6 λ. Let S be a
semigroup and a1 , . . . , ai , b1 , . . . , bi ∈ λ.

For arbitrary semigroup S, every positive integer i 6 n, any collection non-empty subsets A1 , . . . , Ai of S, and
any two collections of distinct elements {a1 , . . . , ai } and {b1 , . . . , bi } of the cardinal λ we denote a subset

for every subset A of the semigroup S and any permutation σ : {1, . . . , i} → {1, . . . , i} we have that

Proposition 3.4. Let λ be a non-zero cardinal and n be any positive integer 6 λ. Then for arbitrary semigroup

Proposition 3.5. For every semigroup S, any non-zero cardinal λ and any positive integer n 6 λ the following
statements hold:
(i) Iλn (S) is regular if and only if so is S;
(ii) Iλn (S) is orthodox if and only if so is S;
(iii) Iλn (S) is inverse if and only if so is S.

Proof. Statement (i) follows from Proposition 3.2.
(ii) (⇐) Suppose that S is an orthodox semigroup. Then statement (i) implies that the semigroup Iλn (S) is
!

regular. By Proposition 3.1 every non-zero idempotent of the semigroup Iλn (S) has the form

···
···
···

ai
ei

,

where 0 < i 6 n and e1 , . . . , ei are idempotents of S. This implies that the product of two idempotents of Iλn (S)
is again an idempotent, and hence the semigroup Iλn (S) is orthodox.
(a)
(⇒) Suppose that Iλn (S) is an orthodox semigroup. By Proposition 3.4, S(a) is a subsemigroup of Iλn (S) for
(a)

every a ∈ λ and hence S(a) is orthodox. Then Proposition 3.4 implies the semigroup S is orthodox, too.
(iii) (⇐) Suppose that S is an inverse semigroup. By statement (i) the semigroup Iλn (S) is regular. Then
using Proposition 3.1 we get that idempotents commute in Iλn (S) and hence by Theorem 1.17 of [11], Iλn (S) is
an inverse semigroup.
(a)
(⇒) Suppose that Iλn (S) is an inverse semigroup. By Proposition 3.4, S(a) is a subsemigroup of Iλn (S) for
every a ∈ λ, and by Proposition 3.3 it is an inverse subsemigroup. Hence by Proposition 3.4, S is an inverse
semigroup.

Since any homomorphic image of a regular (resp., orthodox, inverse) semigroup is a regular (resp., orthodox,
inverse) semigroup (see [11, Section 7.4] and [29, Lemma 2.2]), Proposition 3.5 implies the following corollary.
Corollary 3.6. For every semigroup S, any non-zero cardinal λ and any positive integer n 6 λ the following
statements hold:
(i) Iλn (S) is regular if and only if so is S;
(ii) Iλn (S) is orthodox if and only if so is S;
(iii) Iλn (S) is inverse if and only if so is S.
If S is a semigroup, then we shall denote by R, L , J , D and H the Green relations on S (see [13] or [11,
Section 2.1]):

if and only if

Remark 3.9. Proposition 3.8(iv) implies that if if there exists a permutation σ : {1, . . . , i} → {1, . . . , i} such that
s1 H t(1)σ , . . . , si H t(i)σ in S then αS H βS in Iλn (S). But Example 3.10 implies that converse statement is not
true.
Example 3.10. Let λ be any cardinal > 2 and C (p, q) be the bicyclic monoid. The bicyclic monoid C (p, q) is
the semigroup with the identity 1 generated by two elements p and q subjected only to the condition pq = 1. The
distinct elements of C (p, q) are exhibited in the following useful array

and the semigroup operation on C (p, q) is determined as follows:
q k pl · q m pn = q k+m−min{l,m} pl+n−min{l,m} .
We fix arbitrary distinct elements a1 and a1 of λ and put

and hence αL β in Iλn (S). Thus αH β in Iλn (S), but the elements qp and q 2 p2 are not pairwise H -equivalent
to qp2 and q 2 p for any permutation σ : {1, 2} → {1, 2}.
Recall [28], a semigroup S is said to be:
(a) left stable if for a, b ∈ S, Sa ⊆ Sab implies Sa = Sab;
(b) right stable if for c, d ∈ S, cS ⊆ dcS implies cS = dcS;
(b) stable if it is both left and right stable.
We observe that in the book [11] there given other definition of a stable semigroup, and these two notion are
distinct. A semigroup stable in the sense of Koch and Wallace is always stable in the sense of the book [11],
but not conversely (see: [30]). For semigroups with an identity element and for regular semigroups these two
definitions of stability coincide.
The following proposition states that the construction of the semigroup Iλn (S) preserves left an right stabilities.
Proposition 3.11. For every semigroup S, any non-zero cardinal λ and any positive integer n 6 λ the following
statements hold:
(i) Iλn (S) is right stable if and only if so is S;
(ii) Iλn (S) is left stable if and only if so is S;
(iii) Iλn (S) is stable if and only if so is S.

holds
{a1 , . . . , ai } ⊆ {c1 , . . . , ck } ∩ {d1 , . . . , dk }.
Without loss of generality we may assume that d1 = a1 , . . . , di = ai . Then the inclusion αS Iλn (S) ⊆ βS αS Iλn (S)
implies that there exists a permutation σ : {1, . . . , i} → {1, . . . , i} such that c1 = a(1)σ , . . . , ci = a(i)σ . Hence by

t(l)σ−1 s(l)σ−1 S, for every l ∈ {1, . . . , i}. Since the semigroup of all permutations of a finite set is finite, we conclude
that there exists a positive integer j such that σ j : {1, . . . , i} → {1, . . . , i} is an identity map and therefore we get
that σ j−1 = σ. This implies that for every l ∈ {1, . . . , i} we have that
sl S ⊆ t(l)σ−1 s(l)σ−1 S ⊆ t(l)σ−1 t(l)σ−2 s(l)σ−2 S ⊆ · · · ⊆ t(l)σ−1 t(l)σ−2 · · · t(l)σ−j+1 s(l)σ−j+1 S =
= t(l)σ−1 t(l)σ−2 · · · tl sl S.
Then the right stability of the semigroup S implies the equality sl S = t(l)σ−1 t(l)σ−2 · · · tl sl S and hence we have that
sl S = t(l)σ−1 s(l)σ−1 S, for every l ∈ {1, . . . , i}. Then the inclusion αS Iλn (S) ⊆ βS αS Iλn (S) and above formulae
imply the following equality αS Iλn (S) = βS αS Iλn (S), and hence the semigroup Iλn (S) is right stable.

The proof of statement (ii) is dual to statement (i).

4. On semigroups with a tight ideal series
Fix an arbitrary positive integer m and any p ∈ {0, . . . , m}. Let A be a non-empty set and let B be a non-empty
m
proper subset of A. By [B ⊂ A]m
p we denote all elements (x1 , . . . , xm ) of the power A which satisfy the following
m
property: at most p coordinates of (x1 , . . . , xm ) belong to A \ B. It is obvious that [B ⊂ A]m
m = A any positive
integer m, any non-empty set A and any non-empty proper subset B of A.
The above definition implies the following two lemmas.
Lemma 4.1. Let m be an arbitrary positive integer and p ∈ {1, . . . , m}. Let A be a non-empty set and let B be
m
a non-empty proper subset of A. Then the set [B ⊂ A]m
p \ [B ⊂ A]p−1 consists of all elements (x1 , . . . , xm ) of the
power Am such that exactly p coordinates of (x1 , . . . , xm ) belong to A \ B.
Lemma 4.2. Let m be an arbitrary positive integer and p ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m}. Let S be a semigroup, A and B be
m
ideals in S such that B ⊂ A. Then [B ⊂ A]m
p is an ideal of the direct power S .
An subset D of a semigroup S is said to be ω-unstable if D is infinite and aB ∪ Ba * D for any a ∈ D and any
infinite subset B ⊆ D.
Definition 4.3 ([18]). An ideal series (see, for example, [11]) for a semigroup S is a chain of ideals
I0 ⊆ I1 ⊆ I2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ In = S.
We call the ideal series tight if I0 is a finite set and Dk = Ik \ Ik−1 is an ω-unstable subset for each k = 1, . . . , n.
It is obvious that for every infinite cardinal λ and any positive integer n the semigroup Iλn has a tight ideal
series. A finite direct product of semigroups with tight ideal series is a semigroup with a tight ideal series and
a homomorphic image of a semigroup with a tight ideal series with finite preimages is a semigroup with a tight
ideal series too [18].
A subset D of a semigroup S is said to be strongly ω-unstable if D is infinite and aB ∪ Bb * D for any a, b ∈ D
and any infinite subset B ⊆ D. It is obvious that a subset D of a semigroup S is strongly ω-unstable then D is
ω-unstable.

Definition 4.4. We call the ideal series I0 ⊆ I1 ⊆ I2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ In = S strongly tight if I0 is a finite set and
Dk = Ik \ Ik−1 is a strongly ω-unstable subset for each k = 1, . . . , n.
An example of a semigroup with a strongly tight ideal series gives the following proposition.
Proposition 4.5. Let λ be any infinite cardinal and n be any positive integer. Then
I0 = {0} ⊆ I1 = Iλ1 ⊆ I2 = Iλ2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ In = Iλn ,
is the strongly tight ideal series in the semigroup Iλn .
Proof. The definition of the semigroup Iλn implies that I0 ⊆ I1 ⊆ I2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ In is an ideal series in Iλn .
Fix an arbitrary integer i = 1, . . . , n. For any infinite subset B of Iλi \Iλi−1 at least one of the following families
of sets
d(B) = {dom γ : γ ∈ B}
or
r(B) = {ran γ : γ ∈ B}
is infinite. Then the definition of the semigroup operation in Iλn implies that αB * Iλi \ Iλi−1 in the case when
the set d(B) is infinite, and Bβ * Iλi \ Iλi−1 in the case when the set r(B) is infinite, for any α, β ∈ Iλi \ Iλi−1 . 
Later for an arbitrary non-empty set A, any positive integer n and any i ∈ {1, . . . , n} by πi : An → A,
(a1 , . . . , an ) 7→ ai we shall denote the projection on i-th factor of the power An .
Proposition 4.6. Let n be a positive integer > 2 and let I0 ⊆ I1 ⊆ I2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Im = S be the strongly tight ideal
series for a semigroup S. Then the following series
I0n ⊆ [I0 ⊂ I1 ]n1 ⊆ [I0 ⊂ I1 ]n2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ [I0 ⊂ I1 ]nn−1 ⊆ [I0 ⊂ I1 ]nn = I1n ⊆

= Sn

is a strongly tight ideal series for the direct power S n .
Proof. It is obvious that I0n is a finite ideal of S n . Also by Lemma 4.2 all subsets in series (2) are ideals in S n .
Fix any k ∈ {1, . . . , m} and any p ∈ {1, . . . , n}. We claim that the sets
[Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np \ [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np−1

and

n
[Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]n1 \ Ik−1

are strongly ω-unstable in S n . Indeed, fix an arbitrary infinite subset B ⊆ [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np \ [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np−1 and
any points a = (a1 , . . . , an ), b = (b1 , . . . , bn ) ∈ [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np \ [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np−1 . Then there exists a coordinate
i ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that the set πi (B) ⊆ Ik \ Ik−1 is infinite. If ai ∈
/ Ik \ Ik−1 or bi ∈
/ Ik \ Ik−1 then (ai ·
πi (B) ∪ πi (B) · bi ) ∩ Ik \ Ik−1 = ∅, and hence aB ∪ Bb * [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np \ [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np−1 . If ai , bi ∈ Ik \ Ik−1 then
(ai · πi (B) ∪ πi (B) · bi ) * Ik \ Ik−1 , because the set Ik \ Ik−1 is strongly ω-unstable in S, and hence aB ∪ Bb *
n
is strongly ω-unstable in
[Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np \ [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np−1 . The proof of the statement that the set [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]n1 \ Ik−1
n
S is similar.

Later we fix an arbitrary positive integer n. Then for any semigroup S and any positive integer k 6 n since
Iλk (S) is a subsemigroup of Iλn (S) by ι : Iλk (S) → Iλn (S) we denote this natural embedding. Similar arguments
imply that, without loss of generality for any subsemigroup T of S and any positive integer k 6 n since Iλk (T ) is
a subsemigroup of Iλn (S) by ι : Iλk (T ) → Iλn (S) we denote this natural embedding.
Let A 6= ∅ and k be any positive integer. Asubset B ⊆ Ak is said to be k-symmetric if the following condition
holds: (b1 , . . . , bk ) ∈ B implies b(1)σ , . . . , b(k)σ ∈ B for every permutation σ : {1, . . . , k} → {1, . . . , k}.
Remark 4.7. We observe that every element of the tight ideal series (2) is m-symmetric in S n , and moreover the
n
is m-symmetric in S n , too, for all k ∈ {1, . . . , m} and
sets [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np \ [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]np−1 and [Ik−1 ⊂ Ik ]n1 \ Ik−1
p ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
We need the following construction.
Construction 4.8. Let λ be cardinal > 1, n be any positive integer, k be any positive integer 6 min{n, λ} and
S be a semigroup. For any ordered collections of k distinct elements (a1 , . . . , ak ) and (b1 , . . . , bk ) of λk we define
(a ,...,a )
(a ,...,a )
a map f(b11,...,bkk) : S k → S(b11,...,bkk) by the formula

Theorem 4.10. Let λ be an infinite cardinal and n be a positive integer. If S is a finite semigroup then

I0 = {0} ⊆ I1 = Iλ1 (S) ⊆ I2 = Iλ2 (S) ⊆ · · · ⊆ In = Iλn (S)

is the strongly tight ideal series for the semigroup Iλn (S).
Proof. It is obvious that for every i = 0, 1, . . . , n the set Ii is an ideal in Iλn (S) and moreover the set I0 is finite.
Fix an arbitrary i = 1, . . . , n and any infinite subset B ⊆ Ii \ Ii−1 . Since the semigroup S is finite, every infinite
(a ,...,a )
subset X of Ii \ Ii−1 intersects infinitely many sets of the form S(b11,...,bii) . Then the definition of the semigroup
Iλn (S) implies that at least one of the following families of sets

Theorem 4.11 implies the following

Corollary 4.12. Let λ be an infinite cardinal, n be a positive integer and let I0 ⊆ I1 ⊆ I2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Im = S be the

Theorem 4.13 implies the following

Corollary 4.14. Let λ be a finite cardinal, n be a positive integer 6 λ and let I0 ⊆ I1 ⊆ I2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Im = S be
the strongly tight ideal series for a semigroup S. Then the ideal series (3) is tight for the semigroup Iλn (S).
Let S be a class of semitopological semigroups. A semigroup S ∈ S is called H-closed in S, if S is a
closed subsemigroup of any semitopological semigroup T ∈ S which contains S both as a subsemigroup and
as a topological space. The H-closed topological semigroups were introduced by Stepp in [32], and there they
were called maximal semigroups. An algebraic semigroup S is called:algebraically complete in S, if S with any
Hausdorff topology τ such that (S, τ ) ∈ S is H-closed in S. We observe that many distinct types of H-closedness
of topological and semitopological semigroups studied in [1]–[10], [16]–[21], [24], [26].
By Proposition 10 from [18] every inverse semigroup S with a tight ideal series is algebraically complete in
the class of Hausdorff semitopological inverse semigroups with continuous inversion. Hence Proposition 3.5 and
Theorems 4.11, 4.13 imply the following
Theorem 4.15. Let S be an inverse semigroup which admits a strongly tight ideal series. Then for every non-zero
cardinal λ and any positive integer n 6 λ the semigroup Iλn (S) is algebraically complete in the class of Hausdorff
semitopological inverse semigroups with continuous inversion.
We remark that in the case when n = 1 the construction of Iλ1 (S) preserves the property to be a semigroup
with a tight ideal series, and this follows from the following theorem.

Proof. We consider the case when cardinal λ is infinite. In the other case the proof is similar.
The semigroup operation of Iλ1 (S) implies that the the set Jk is ideal in Iλ1 (S) for an arbitrary integer
k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m + 1}.

Fix an arbitrary k ∈ {1, . . . , m + 1}. Then for any infinite subset B of Jk \ Jk−1 and any α =  s  ∈ Jk \ Jk−1

(1) If B ∩ S(i) is infinite for some i ∈ λ then B ∩ S(i) ⊆ [Ik−1 \ Ik2 ](i) . Hence, the semigroup operation of Iλ1 (S)
implies that αB ∪ Bα * Jk \ Jk−1 in the case when a = b = i, because the set Ik−1 \ Ik2 is ω-unstable in
S. Otherwise 0 ∈ αB ∪ Bα * Jk \ Jk−1 .
(2) In the other case the semigroup operation of Iλ1 (S) implies that 0 ∈ αB ∪ Bα * Jk \ Jk−1 .
Both above statements imply that the set Jk \ Jk−1 is ω-unstable in Iλ1 (S), which completes the proof of the
theorem.

separate continuity of the semigroup operation on Iλn (S) implies that there exist an open neighbourhood U (αS )
of αS such that ε1 [1S ] · U (αS ) · ε2 [1S ] ⊆ W (αS ). The neighbourhood U (αS ) is requested. Indeed, if there exists

with the following property ε1 [1S ] · U (αS ) · ε2 [1S ] ⊆ S(b11,...,bkk) .
Proposition 5.3. Let S be a monoid, λ be any non-zero cardinal, n be an arbitrary positive integer 6 λ, 0 <

We recall that a topological space X is said to be
• compact if each open cover of X has a finite subcover;
• H-closed if X is a closed subspace of every Hausdorff topological space in which it contained.
It is well known that every Hausdorff compact space is H-closed, and every regular H-closed topological space is
compact (see [12, 3.12.5]).

Definition 5.7. Let S be a class of semitopological semigroups. Let λ > 1 be a cardinal, n be a positive integer

Proposition 5.1 and Theorem 5.9 imply the following corollary.
Corollary 5.10. Let (S, τ ) be a Hausdorff compact semitopological monoid, λ be any non-zero cardinal, n be an
arbitrary positive integer 6 λ, 0 < k 6 n and (Iλn (S), τI ) be a compact topological Iλn -extension of (S, τ ) in the
(a ,...,a )
class of Hausdorff semitopological semigroups. Then S(b11,...,bkk) is an open-and-closed subset of (Iλn (S), τI ) for
any ordered collections of k distinct elements (a1 , . . . , ak ) and (b1 , . . . , bk ) of λk , and the space (Iλn (S), τI ) is the
topological sum of such sets with isolated zero.
Remark 5.11. Since by Theorem of [21] an infinite semigroup of matrix units and hence an infinite semigroup
Iλn do not embed into compact Hausdorff topological semigroups, Corollary 5.10 describes compact topological
Iλn -extensions of compact semigroups (S, τ ) in the class of Hausdorff topological semigroups.

is compact implies Iλk (S), τIc is compact, too, for k = 2, . . . , n. Without loss of generality we my assume that
k = n.

Let U be an arbitrary open cover of Iλn (S), τIc which consists of elements of the subbase P c . The assumption
of induction implies that there exists a finite subfamily Un−1 of U which is a subcover of Iλn−1 (S). Fix an arbitrary
(a ,...,a )

element V0 = Iλn (S) \ ⇑S(b11,...,bpp) ∈ Un−1 which contains the zero 0 of Iλn (S). Then p ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

(a ,...,a )

We observe that an arbitrary element U0 of the family {Pkc (0) : k = 1, . . . , n} contains the set S(b11,...,bpp) if and
(a ,...,a )

only if U0 ∩ S(b11,...,bpp) 6= ∅. This implies that only one of the following conditions holds:
(1) there does not exist an element of Un−1 from the family {Pkc (0) : k = 1, . . . , n} which contains the set
(a ,...,a )
S(b11,...,bpp) ;
(a ,...,a )

(2) there exists W0 ∈ Un−1 ∩ {Pkc (0) : k = 1, . . . , n} such that S(b11,...,bpp) ⊆ W0 .
(a ,...,a )

Suppose that condition (1) holds. First we consider the case when p < n. By Theorem 5.9, S(b11,...,bpp) is compact,
(c )

in Un−1 ∩P c \{Pkc (0) : k = 1, . . . , n}
and hence there exists finitely many elements ⇑ [U (s1 )](d11 ) , . . . , ⇑ [U (sm )](dm

such that S(b1 ,...,bp ) ⊆ ⇑ [U (s1 )](d1 ) ∪ · · · ∪ ⇑ [U (sm )](dm ) . It is obvious that U0 , ⇑ [U (s1 )](d1 ) , . . . , ⇑ [U (sm )](dm )

is a finite cover of Iλn (S), τIc .
(a ,...,a )

Next, we consider case p = n. We identify the set S(b11,...,bnn) and the power S n by the mapping
(a ,...,a )

H : S(b11,...,bnn)

The semigroup operation of Iλn (S) implies that ⇑ [U (s)](d) ∩ S(b11,...,bnn) 6= ∅ if and only if c = ai and d = bi for
some i = 1, . . . , n. Then by (8) for every i = 1, . . . , n we have that

Then the subbase P c on Iλn (S) and the map (8) determine the product topology on S n from the space S, and
hence the space S n is compact.
(a ,...,a )
(a ,...,a )
Suppose that S(b11,...,bnn) is not compact. Then S(b11,...,bnn) has a cover W which consists of the open sets of the
(c)

form ⇑ [U (s)](d) and W does not have a finite subcover. Then the cover WS n of S n which determines by formula
(9) from the family W has no finite subcover, too. This contradicts the compactness of S n .
Hence in case (1) the cover U of Iλn (S) has a finite subcover.
(c ,...,c )
(c ,...,c )
(a ,...,a )
Suppose that condition (2) holds. Then W0 = Iλn (S)\⇑S(d11 ,...,dqq ) with q 6 n. If ⇑S(d11 ,...,dqq ) ∩⇑S(b11,...,bpp) = ∅ then
{V0 , W0 } is a cover of Iλn (S). In the other case there exists a smallest positive integer p1 such that max{p+1, q} 6
p1 6 n and two ordered p1 -collections of distinct elements (e1 , . . . , ep1 ) and (f1 , . . . , fp1 ) of the power λp1 such

(e ,...,ep )

that ⇑S(d11 ,...,dqq ) ∩ ⇑S(b11,...,bpp) = ⇑S(f11,...,fp 1 ) . Then for the open set U1 = U0 ∪ W0 = Iλn (S) \ ⇑S(f11,...,fp 1 ) either
1

condition (1) or condition (2) holds.

Since p + 1 6 p1 6 n, we repeating finitely many items the above procedure we get that the space Iλn (S), τIc
is compact.

Next we shall show that the topology τIc is shift-continuous on Iλn (S), τIc . We consider all possible cases.
(i) 0 · 0 = 0. Then for any open neighbourhood U0 of zero in Iλn (S), τIc we have that
U0 · 0 = 0 · U0 = {0} ⊆ U0 .


(ii) α · 0 = 0. Then for any open neighbourhoods U0 and Uα of zero and α in Iλn (S), τIc , respectively, we
have that
Uα · 0 = {0} ⊆ U0 .
