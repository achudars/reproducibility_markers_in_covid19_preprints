Abstract: Superconducting proximity pairing in helical edge modes, such as those of topological
insulators (TI), is predicted to provide a unique platform for realizing Majorana zero modes
(MZMs). We use scanning tunneling microscopy measurements to probe the influence of
proximity induced superconductivity and magnetism on the helical hinge states of Bi(111) films,
grown on a superconducting Nb substrate and decorated with magnetic Fe clusters. Consistent
with model calculations, our measurements reveal the emergence of a localized MZM at the
interface between the superconducting helical edge channel and the Fe clusters with strong
magnetization component along the edge. Our experiments also resolve the MZM’s spin signature
that distinguishes it from trivial in-gap states that may accidently occur at zero energy in a
superconductor.

Main Text: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are non-Abelian quasi-particles that can emerge at the
ends of one-dimensional (1D) topological superconductors (1,2). They may one day provide an
experimental setting for topologically protected qubits. To date, strong evidence for the existence
of MZMs has come from systems in which the proximity effect from a conventional
superconductor is used in concert with strong spin-orbit, Zeeman or ferromagnetic exchange
interaction to engineer a system with topological superconductivity. In particular, experiments on
semiconducting nanowires and magnetic atomic chains have provided key signatures of MZMs
(3-5) and of their unique charge and spin spectroscopic properties (6-8). The presence of MZMs
in these platforms however does not rely on intrinsically topological electronic states but rather on
engineering 1D band structures with properties suitable for an “effective” p-wave order parameter
to emerge when in contact with a conventional s-wave superconductor (9-14). The strength of the
induced pairing in these systems, which is the key parameter for the protection of a MZM from
quasi-particle poisoning, is also reliant on the strength of spin-orbit interaction. As an alternative
to these systems, one might consider topological insulators (TIs), the helical edge modes of which
intrinsically exhibit large (essentially infinite at low energies in the bulk gap) spin-orbit interaction.
Crucially, TIs provide a platform where topological superconductivity can be realized in channels
that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, allowing for material imperfections (15) in the
absence of a magnetic field. Because this concept does not rely on band engineering, and the
presence of a magnetic field is not necessary in the superconducting coupled part of the helical
edge mode to induce MZMs, the strength of the induced pairing on such channels could also be
large. Thus this potential MZM platform could provide better protection than existing schemes
from both disorder and thermal excitation of quasi-particles (16).

Hinge states as an MZM platform
To realize topological superconductivity and MZMs in a time-reversal-protected helical
channel, we utilize the topological edge and hinge states of bismuth (Bi). Although it has long
been recognized that a Bi bilayer in isolation is a two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator with
1D helical edge modes (17), recent efforts have argued that bulk Bi is an example of a higher order
topological insulator (18-22), which hosts topologically protected 1D helical states along its hinges
(23). Consistent with this new perspective, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies on the
Bi(111) surface have shown that on the perimeter of a hexagonally shaped bilayer island, every
other edge shows signatures of 1D topological boundary mode (24). This experimental observation
can be understood in terms of the hinge modes being hybridized with the surface state of Bi(111)
along half of the edges of the hexagonal island (Fig. 1A). Other measurements have also probed
Josephson coupling through the Bi hinge states in a nanowire geometry, demonstrating ballistic
transport consistent with their topological nature (25). Here, we induce superconductivity in these
topological hinge states (26-28) and terminate them using a ferromagnetic cluster, which breaks
local time-reversal symmetry. The superconductor-ferromagnetic-cluster interface represents a
domain wall where the gap changes its character and where we expect a MZM to emerge (Fig 1A).
We theoretically consider this MZM platform using a tight-binding model to capture the
1D topological edge states of a bilayer island on a Bi(111) surface and a proximity induced pairing
on such edge channels via coupling to a conventional bulk superconductor (29); we also account
for their hybridization with both the electronic states of a ferromagnetic cluster and those of the
underlying Bi bulk, which leads to the hinge-like behavior of these states (see Sec. 1 of (30)). The
results of our theoretical modeling confirm our expectation for the existence of a MZM in the

3

superconducting topological edge states of Bi (Fig.1). They also show additional features that have
not been considered in previous proposals (15, 26) involving topological edge modes, which,
however, are important to the experimental implementation. As expected, we find a proximityinduced superconducting gap in the local density of states (LDOS) along the hinge state and a
MZM that emerges from this edge channel at the boundary between the regions of dominant
induced pairing and magnetic gaps (Fig. 1, A to C). We also find that the hybridization of the hinge
states with the Bi bulk states along half of the bilayer edges (Fig. 1A) renders the wavefunction of
the second MZM at the interface with the magnetic cluster highly delocalized with weak
contributions to the LDOS at such locations (See Sec. 1 of (30)). Our calculation also highlights
the presence of in-gap Shiba states, which can occur near magnetic impurities in a superconductor
and appear on the magnetic cluster in the LDOS at finite energy (Fig. 1, B and C) (31, 32). These
trivial states require a finite magnetic polarization regardless of its spatial orientation. In contrast,
as discussed below, the appearance of an MZM is in addition sensitive to the orientation of the
magnetism of the cluster. This difference as well as distinctions in the spin properties of the MZM
from those of Shiba states can be used to distinguish an MZM from a trivial zero energy Shiba
state.
Previous proposals considered a local Zeeman interaction for the opening of magnetic gap
at the time-reversal invariant points of the topological edge state band structure (15). In our
platform, the hybridization of the Bi edge channels with the electronic states of a ferromagnetic
cluster (such as iron (Fe) in our experiments) results in an additional magnetic hybridization gap
∆H in the topological edge state band structure ( Fig. 1D). Thanks to the direct coupling between
the cluster and the edge, a magnetic hybridization gap can have a much larger magnitude than a
Zeeman-induced magnetic gap, which enters as a second order effect in terms of the same

4

coupling. Therefore, in our platform we can circumvent the need for fine tuning the chemical
potential into the magnetic gap for an MZM to emerge. Additional calculations also reveal that the
opening of such magnetic hybridization gaps in the proximitized topological band structure is
indeed accompanied by a change of the system’s topological invariant, as is required for the
topological protection of the localized MZM (see Sec. 2 of (30)). However, as shown in Fig. 1, D
to E, the appearance of such a magnetic hybridization gap by coupling the edge mode to the
magnetic cluster not only depends on the strength of the coupling but also on the cluster’s magnetic
exchange energy scale and the orientation of its magnetization. Although the exact spin
polarization of our Bi helical edge mode is not known, similar to other spin-momentum-locked
topological edge modes, we expect the spin polarization to point along some direction orthogonal
to momentum of these 1D states along the edge. Therefore, a cluster with a magnetization pointing
along the edge is most favorable for opening of a gap in the edge state’s band structure so as to
localize a MZM (Fig. 1D). Additional magnetization components of such clusters modify the band
structure in more complex ways and are usually detrimental to opening up a gap at the Fermi level
(Fig. 1E). This sensitivity to the cluster’s magnetization shows that MZMs can only emerge for
clusters with properly oriented magnetization and ultimately provides the potential ability to tune
MZMs on and off on this platform, by reorienting the magnetization.

Realization of the platform
To realize our proposed platform, we grow thin films of Bi(111) on a (110) oriented single
crystal of niobium (Nb) (sputtered and annealed first for cleaning) and use in-situ low temperature
STM imaging and spectroscopy at 1.4 K to confirm the presence of topological hinge states on
their surface (see Materials and Methods in (30)). As shown in Fig. 2, these states can be identified
5

on the surface of 30 Å thick Bi(111) thin films by van Hove singularity in their LDOS, as detected
by STM spectroscopy (Fig. 2B) and its mapping (Fig. 2D). They appear on edges we label as type
A, where they are not hybridized with the bulk or surface state of Bi crystals. Spectroscopic
mapping along finite segments of these edge channels near the Fermi energy shows standing wave
patterns in their LDOS (Fig. 2 E), the Fourier transform of which reveals the dispersion of a 1D
band near the Fermi energy (see Sec. 3 & 4 of (30)). A previous analysis of these standing wave
pattern shows that the observed wavelengths are determined by the scattering between nonorthogonal spin states of the edge state band structure within one half of the Brillouin zone (24).
Scattering and interference between time-reversed pairs of states in the edge band structure is not
observed in such measurements—a behavior consistent with the absence of backscattering in such
topological states.
Owing to the proximity effect from the underlying Nb substrate, superconductivity opens
a gap in the 1D band structure at the Fermi energy that can be distinguished from the gap found
on the bilayer surface (Fig. 2E). We can separate the gap measured on the A edge into two
contributions coming from the surface state and the topological edge state, of which the latter
yields a topological gap that can be fitted using BCS theory (see Sec. 5 of (30)). Following this
analysis, we find the gap of the topological edge state (∆T=1.50 ± 0.01 meV) to have approximately
the same size (slightly lower, a point which will be later used) as that measured on the bare Nb(110)
substrate surface (∆S=1.52 ± 0.01 meV). Given that such superconducting gaps in topologically
protected helical channels are intrinsically non-trivial, this system has, by far, the largest gap
magnitude as compared to other 1D MZM proximity platforms, such as atomic chains or
semiconductor nanowires reported to date, which have ∆ T≤200 µeV (4,5). The application of
magnetic field or presence of ferromagnetism reduces the p-wave gap considerably in these

6

systems as compared to that of conventional superconductor used for proximity. One other
example of intrinsic topological superconductivity with large gaps (2meV) has been reported in
the Fe-based superconductors, where signatures of MZMs within the vortex cores of their 2D
topological surface states have been recently observed (33, 34).
To introduce a local magnetic perturbation that results in the emergence of MZMs along
the proximitized Bi hinge states, we deposit Fe atoms on the Bi(111) surface and anneal the surface
(to 373 K) after which we find clusters of Fe nucleated at the bilayer step edges of our sample. The
most common location for the nucleation of such clusters is between A and B edges as shown in
Fig. 3. While we find some clusters at the center of a B edge (see Sec. 10 and Fig. S14 & S15 of
(30)), we never find clusters at the center of an A edge. The clusters appear with different lengths
with a height 2-3 Å (as measured from the top bilayer) in the STM topographies. The magnetic
properties of such clusters and their influence on the electronic properties of the topological edge
state are characterized by means of spin-polarized STM (see Sec. 6 of (30)) (35). In such
measurements, we record the spin-polarized tunnel conductance dI/dV at low bias voltage between
the sample and an Fe-coated Cr STM tip as a function of the applied magnetic field. The dI/dV
measurement on the Fe cluster, hereafter labelled #1, displays a step-like change of the
conductance, ΔG, near zero field, which is characteristic of tunneling between a ferromagnetic
cluster and a superparamagnetic tip (Fig. 3B). The small hysteric behavior in these conductance
measurements confirms the weak magnetic anisotropy of our tip’s magnetization and its
superparamagnetic behavior. Spin-polarized measurements performed with such tips away from
the magnetic cluster along the bilayer A edge also show similar step-like features in dI/dV.
Characterizing these measurements by plotting the relative change of the conductance ΔG with
respect to the conductance at small positive magnetic field as a function of the tip distance from

7

the cluster along the A edge (Fig. 3C), we find a behavior indicative of a decaying oscillatory
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida-interaction-induced polarization of the one-dimensional edge
state by the Fe cluster (36, 37). The coupling of the Fe clusters to the Bi electronic states appears
to also influence the clusters’ LDOS—leaving spectroscopic features that can be captured by our
model and used to extract the strength of the magnetic hybridization gap in the Bi-edge modes
caused by the Fe clusters (see Sec. 7 of (30)). Together, these measurements demonstrate the
ferromagnetic nature of the Fe clusters, their ability to induce magnetism into the topological edge
state of Bi, and indications of the clusters introducing a sizable magnetic hybridization gap on the
Bi-edge modes (~80meV, see Sec. 7 of (30)).
Examining different Fe clusters, we observe a similar behavior; however, we also find
evidence for variations in the magnetization axis of different clusters. Characterizing STM
topographies measured with the superparamagnetic tips that are polarized using our in-situ vectormagnetic field, we can reconstruct the effective magnetization vector of the clusters (see Sec. 8 of
(30)). Our results for clusters labeled #1-#6 are summarized in Fig. 3D, showing that these clusters
can be separated into two groups (orange and blue) by the amplitude of their magnetization
component perpendicular to the edge. Such different cluster magnetizations may impact the 1D
edge modes band structure in multiple ways, as anticipated by our model calculations shown in
Fig.1 (see Sec. 1 of (30))

Observation of MZMs
Having established the presence of both superconducting pairing and ferromagnetism in
our samples, we use high-resolution STM spectroscopy to probe the low energy properties and to
search for localized MZMs in this system. In Fig. 4, we show a typical example of such an
8

experiment on cluster #2 that shows the emergence of a sharp zero bias peak (ZBP) within the
pairing gap along the Bi bilayer A edge (peak width ∆E ≤ 400 µeV, Fig. 1, B-D) as the tip
approaches the hinge-cluster interface. Spectroscopy on top of the cluster, away from the interface,
shows Shiba states at finite positive and negative energies that are separated by a suppression of
the tunnel conductance at zero energy (Fig. 1, B-C). A detailed analysis of the spatial profile of
the ZBP in Fig. 4D demonstrates that it is strongest in magnitude on the superconducting 1D
channel, precisely at the interface of the channel with the Fe cluster. The tail of the ZBP extends
along the channel and as shown in Fig 4D can still be detected at about half of its peak value 2 nm
away from the interface. This length scale is consistent with the theoretical expectation of the
spatial decay of the MZM wavefunction in our system, when we crucially take into account the
renormalization of the edge mode Fermi velocity caused by the proximity effect with the Nb
substrate (see Sec. 9 of (30)) (38-40). We also observe the presence of such a ZBP localized at the
hinge-cluster interface for clusters #1, #3 & #4 (see Sec. 8 and Fig. S11 of (30)). Overall, our
experimental observation of a localized ZBP in these experiments is consistent with our model
calculations described in Fig. 1, and its interpretation as a spectroscopic signature of an MZM.
Examining other clusters under varying experimental conditions, we obtain further
observations that corroborate the interpretation of the ZBP as due to the presence of an MZM (see
Sec. 10 of (30)). We find that the ZBP is absent when the application of a magnetic field suppresses
superconductivity in our hybrid system, thereby excluding the Kondo effect as the origin of the
ZBP (Fig. S13 of (30)). We also find that Fe clusters on top of B edges, where the edge modes are
strongly hybridized with the bulk states, do not show ZBPs, suggesting that the presence of an
isolated helical edge mode is required for the ZBP to appear (Fig. S14 of (30)). The data on these
edges also demonstrate that the Fe clusters, even those as long as 80Å, are not the source of the

9

ZBP themselves (Fig. S15 of (30)). This is in contrast to other magnetic atomic chain systems on
the surface of a superconductor (4), for which a non-trivial bulk topology of the chain itself can
induce topological superconductivity and localize MZMs. Our theoretical modeling also predicts
a second weakly localized MZM at the interface between an Fe cluster and a B edge owing to the
hybridization of the topological edge state with the underlying bulk states on the B edge.
Spectroscopic measurements near the B-edge find signatures of an LDOS enhancement near zero
energy consistent with this prediction (see Sec. 9 of (30)). More importantly, although our
observation of a ZBP has been reproduced for many superconducting A edge-Fe cluster interfaces
(see Sec. 8 of (30)), we do find that a fraction of these systems does not show a ZBP. When
comparing with the reconstructed magnetization vectors of the different Fe clusters shown in Fig.
3D, we observe a clear correlation between the observation of a ZBP and the type of cluster
magnetization. Clusters #1-4 have a weak magnetization component perpendicular to the edge and
show a ZBP, whereas clusters #5-6 have a sizable magnetization component perpendicular to the
edge and do not show a ZBP. Such a behavior is consistent with our model calculations (Fig. 1E
and Sec.1 of (30)), which show that a magnetization component perpendicular to the edge is
detrimental to inducing the magnetic hybridization gap in the topological edge state necessary to
localize an MZM.
Spin polarization of MZMs
Finally, we use energy-resolved spin-polarized spectroscopic measurements with the STM
to demonstrate that we can distinguish the presence of an MZM from that of a trivial zero mode,
which might form accidentally in our system. Previous studies have shown that trivial in-gap states
appear with an energy asymmetric characteristic in the extracted spin-polarization P(E) from spinresolved STM spectroscopic measurements under constant current conditions (6, 40). We have

10

carried out such measurements on the Fe clusters, where we find the predicted behavior of P(E)
for the Shiba states induced at low energies by these clusters (Fig. 5A). This asymmetric behavior
of trivial states in P(E) results in their lacking spin contrast in this measurement at zero energy,
and thereby can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish MZMs. As shown in Fig. 5B, the ZBP
at the A-edge-Fe cluster interface shows a strong spin contrast at zero energy hence confirming
that it does not arise from a trivial zero energy mode. Besides this important distinction between
the MZM and trivial Shiba states, fundamentally in our platform the magnetization of these two
different states are expected to point along different orientations. The spin orientation of the Shiba
states is dictated by the orientation of the magnetic cluster, whereas the MZM occurring in the
topological channel generically has a different spin orientation, which can be even perpendicular
to the Shiba state. (see Sec. 11 of (30)). The differing sign of the spin polarization P(E) of the
MZM and the positive energy Shiba state is consistent with this expectation and adds yet another
unique feature of the MZM formed at the interface between superconductivity and magnetism on
a topological edge mode. (see Sec. 11 of (30))
Looking ahead, our demonstration of MZMs within the topological edge states of Bi can
be extended to Bi nanowires (25) and similar realization in other 2D or 3D higher order topological
insulators by using magnetic clusters as a way of localizing MZMs in the presence of proximityinduced superconductivity. The Bi nanowires also provide a viable approach to create devices
based on this platform. Clusters with weak magnetic anisotropy could be used to turn on and off
the MZMs with in-plane magnetic fields reliably. If such fields are low enough, they might not
disrupt the superconductivity of the edge but switch the magnetic state of the clusters. Employing
spin-torque tunneling effects can present a viable alternative to switch the cluster magnetization,
providing an approach to manipulate the presence of MZMs. In view of the recent progress in the

11

field of 2D materials (41-43), we anticipate that this approach of localizing MZMs in topologically
protected helical edge channels may also be realized using van-der-Waals heterostructures.
