The self-assembly of submonolayer amounts of Au on the densely stepped Si(553) surface creates
an array of closely spaced “atomic wires” separated by 1.5 nm. At low temperature, charge transfer
between the terraces and the row of silicon dangling bonds at the step edges leads to a charge-ordered
state within the row of dangling bonds with ×3 periodicity. Interactions between the dangling bonds
lead to their ordering into a fully two-dimensional (2D) array with centered registry between adjacent
steps. We show that as the temperature is raised, soliton defects are created within each step edge.
The concentration of solitons rises with increasing temperature and eventually destroys the 2D
order by decoupling the step edges, reducing the effective dimensionality of the system to 1D. This
crossover from higher to lower dimensionality is unexpected and, indeed, opposite to the behavior
in other systems.

Physical phenomena associated with low dimensionality are suppressed when the temperature is raised. For
example, the 2D fractional quantum Hall effect [1, 2]
and the 1D Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid [3–5] are only observed at low temperature. In 1D atomic wire systems
at low temperatures, Peierls distortions or more general
symmetry breakings can open a gap at the Fermi level
and lower the total energy by forming a charge density
wave (CDW) [6–8] or spin-density wave (SDW) [9–12].
Excitations generally wash out the effects of this
anisotropy and hence suppress low-dimensional behavior.
The resulting crossover to higher dimensionality at increased temperatures is exhibited by many systems. Recent examples include the atomic wire systems Pt(110)Br and Si(557)-Pb. In these systems, structural changes
are accompanied by a delicate interplay between CDW
correlations and short-range interactions of the adsorbate
atoms [13] and by correlated spin-orbit order that triggers a metal-to-insulator transition, respectively [14–17].
The resulting dimensional crossover from 1D to 2D is
typical for atomic wire systems.
In this Letter we demonstrate the opposite case: a system of coupled atomic wires exhibiting 2D order at low
temperatures in which thermal excitations at higher temperatures induce a dimensional crossover to 1D behavior.
We identify the mechanism driving this crossover to be
the creation of phase solitons and antisolitons [18, 19],
which leads to an reversible order-disorder transition at
higher temperatures [20]. We track the crossover across
its characteristic temperature (approximately 100 K) using a combination of a quantitative high resolution spot
profile analyzing-low energy electron diffraction (SPALEED) study, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, Monte Carlo statistical simulations, and an exactly

solvable analytical model.
We studied the self-organized Si(553)-Au atomic wire
surface consisting of Au double-atom rows on (111)oriented Si terraces separated by bilayer steps [Fig. 1].
Charge transfer from the terraces leads to incomplete
filling of the dangling sp3 orbitals at the Si step edge
[20–22]. The low-temperature ground state consists of
a charge-ordered state with ×3 periodicity along the
step edges, which is observed in scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) [20, 22–29] and LEED experiments
[20, 28–30]. The ×3 periodicity along the wires represents the simplest way to distribute the available electrons among the row of dangling bonds while maximizing the number of fully saturated dangling bonds (electron lone pairs) [31]. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements [21, 24, 30, 32] and DFT calculations [24, 32–34] reveal that the dangling-bond states do
not cross the Fermi level. Hence, all the dangling-bond
orbitals have integer electron occupancies of 0, 1, or 2.
We will refer to orbitals with occupancy 2 as saturated
dangling bonds (SDBs) and to those less than 2 as unsaturated dangling bonds (UDBs). Figure 1 depicts the
arrangement of UDBs and SDBs schematically. The ordering of the Si dangling bond structure is mediated by
Coulomb interaction of the UDBs (large spheres) with
approximately equal spacing within and across the rows.
The SDBs merely provide a compensating background
charge to balance the reduced electron occupancy of the
UDBs.
The actual number of electrons in the UDBs has been
previously investigated using DFT. The result is sensitive to the choice of the exchange-correlation functional.
The original prediction [33], which used the functional
of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [35], was that

2
five electrons are shared among three dangling bonds
with an electron configuration (2,2,1) having ×3 periodicity and one unpaired spin [28]. More recent work
[36], based on the revised PBEsol functional [37], predicted that only four electrons are shared among three
dangling bonds, implying the configuration (2,2,0) with
no unpaired spins. At present it is not possible to distinguish between these scenarios on the basis of experimental data. Here we consider both possibilities and show
that they lead to very different estimates of the orderdisorder transition temperature.
The experiment was performed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions at a base pressure lower than
1 × 10−10 mbar. The Si substrate was cut from an ntype Si(553) wafer (phosphorus doped, 0.01 Ω cm). Prior
to Au deposition, the sample was cleaned in several
short flash-anneal cycles by heating via direct current
to 1250 ◦ C. Next, 0.48 ML (monolayer, referred to the
atomic density of a Si(111) surface, i. e. 1 ML = 7.83 ×
1014 atoms per cm2 ) Au was deposited from an electronbeam-heated graphite crucible [38] at a substrate temperature of 650 ◦ C, followed by a post-annealing step at
850 ◦ C for several seconds [25] and subsequent cooling to
60 K on a liquid helium cryostat. The temperature was
measured by an ohmic sensor (Pt100) directly clamped
to the back of the sample.

Figure 1: Ground state structure and low-energy excitation
of the Si(553)-Au atomic wire system. The underlying substrate consists of Si(111) terraces separated by steps. Each
terrace contains a dimerized double row of Au atoms (gold)
and a row of Si dangling bonds (gray spheres) at the step
edge. The electron occupancy of these dangling bonds creates a ground state with tripled periodicity: for every two
saturated dangling bonds (SDBs, small spheres) there is a
third, unsaturated dangling bond (UDB, large spheres). At
finite temperatures, some of these UDBs (blue) become mobile and hop to adjacent sites (red). This excitation creates a
soliton-antisoliton pair that can subsequently dissociate.

At 60 K, the SPA-LEED pattern [Fig. 2(a)] reveals
spots

at ×3 positions and streaks at ×2 positions in the
1 1 0 direction. The latter indicates the formation of Au
atomic wires. The spacing of the ×1 spots corresponds
to the reciprocal lattice constant a∗k = 2π/(3.84 Å) of the
Si substrate along the steps. The ×3 spots arise from
ordering of the UDBs within the rows; hence, the UDBs
have an intra-row separation of 3 × ak = 11.5 Å. The
UDBs in different rows are in registry: recent investigations by SPA-LEED and STM reveal a centered
 p(1 × 3)

arrangement [Figs. 2(a,c)] [28]. In the 3 3 10 direction
the reciprocal step-to-step distance is a∗⊥ = 2π/(14.8 Å)
[21] and thus the separation between the UDB rows is
14.8 Å. Hence, at low temperatures the UDBs in Si(553)Au are arranged in rows in a fully ordered 2D array with
approximately equal spacing within (11.5 Å) and across
(14.8 Å) the rows. The ×2 streaks are attributed to the
dimerized double row of Au atoms on the (111) terrace
of the surface [gold spheres in Fig. 2(c); the unit cell is
shown by the blue-shaded areas in Figs. 2(a,c)] [34,39].
We did not detect any ×6 periodicity in the 1 1 0 direction, indicating that the Au atoms and Si step-edge
atoms are structurally decoupled [27, 28, 36].

energy of 150 eV and temperatures (a) 60 K and (b) 180 K.
The ×2 streaks between the rows of sharp integer-order spots
arise from dimerized Au double rows on the (111)-oriented
terraces. The rows of elongated spots at ×3 positions indicate
the tripled periodicity and long-range order of the UDBs at
the Si step edge. The intensity of the ×2 streak is nearly
unaffected at higher temperature, while the ×3 features fade
away. In (a) the unit cells of the Au (blue) and Si (green)

and LP⊥ (Fig. 3) are indicated (for more details see [28]). (c)

Carlo simulations based on DFT interactions are shown in

FWHM in (a) indicates loss of inter-wire correlation, while
in (b) it indicates a decreasing correlation length along
 the
steps. At low temperatures the FWHM is constant in 3 3 10
direction up to ∼90 K. Insets in (a,b): Line profiles for both
directions at various temperatures (shifted for better visibility). (c) Structural model of creation and separation of a
soliton-antisoliton pair. Charge is transferred from an SDB
to a UDB, generating a hop of the UDB to a neighboring site
and creating a soliton-antisoliton pair. If this pair separates
then a phase-shifted domain with ×3 periodicity is formed.

At 180 K, the intensity of the ×3 spots fades markedly
[Fig. 2(b)], in agreement with an earlier study [20], while
the intensity of the ×2 streaks is nearly unaffected. To
analyze the evolution of the diffraction pattern between
60 K to 190 K (heating rate 0.13 K/s), we recorded a
series of line profiles [Fig. 3(a,b)] through the ×3 spots,



in two orthogonal

 directions: 3 3 10 (LP⊥ , across the
steps) and 1 1 0 (LPk , along the steps). The ×3 diffraction spots [insets of Fig. 3(a,b)] of each of the line profiles
were best fitted by a series of equidistant Lorentzian functions. No Gaussian-like central spike is found and the
positions of the ×3 diffraction spots do not shift with
temperature. Across the steps, the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) κ⊥ steadily increases as the temperature is raised from 60 K to 130 K. Eventually, the spots
merge into streaks, consistent with the vanishing of the
×3 periodicity reported earlier [20].
Along the steps, the FWHM κk is relatively constant
up to about 100 K and then steadily increases as the
temperature is raised further. This broadening of the
×3 diffraction spots is due to increasing disorder in the
arrangement of UDBs. This type of disorder originates
from a simple microscopic process in which an electron
(or two electrons, for the (2,2,0) configuration) hops
from an SDB onto a neighboring UDB [middle panel of
Fig. 3(c)]. As long as these electron hops do not bring
neighboring UDBs closer than 2ak , the configuration is
metastable.
We used DFT to determine the formation energy E0
of this elementary excitation, which can be viewed as
a soliton-antisoliton bound pair. The calculations were
performed in a 1×6 cell of Si(553)Au with four silicon double layers plus the reconstructed surface layer
and a vacuum region of 10 Å. All atomic positions were
relaxed except the hydrogen-passivated bottom double
layer. Total energies and forces were calculated using the
generalized-gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke,
and Ernzerhof (PBE) for the (2,2,1) configuration and
the PBEsol revision of that functional for the (2,2,0) configuration, with projector-augmented wave potentials as
implemented in VASP [37, 40, 41]. The plane-wave cutoff was 250 eV and the sampling of the surface Brillouin
zone was 6 × 6.
For the (2,2,1) ground-state configuration we find E0 =
30 meV, suggesting these defects will be numerous at
temperatures above ∼300 K, which is consistent with our
experimental data. For the (2,2,0) configuration we find
E0 = 85 meV, implying a much higher temperature scale
of ∼1000 K.
To investigate the concentration and distribution of defects as a function of temperature, we used the Metropolis
Monte Carlo method to sample the steady-state arrangement of UDBs in an infinite array of dangling-bond wires
with the Si(553)-Au geometry. We performed 107 trial
hops at each temperature and computed the diffraction
intensity from the positions of the UDBs. The spectra
were convolved with a Gaussian to account for instrumental broadening in the experimental data. For the
(2,2,1) configuration, the resulting FWHM of the ×3
peaks is constant up to ∼100 K and then increases gradually with temperature, in agreement with experiment
but with smaller values [blue squares in Fig. 3(b)]. For

4
the (2,2,0) configuration the FWHM is flat up to temperatures about three times higher (blue triangles), as
expected from the q 2 scaling of the Coulomb energy. See
Supplementary Material for additional details.
Even though the geometry of our model is 2D, the
energy scale of Coulomb interactions across the wires is
only 0.1 meV, three orders of magnitude smaller than E0 .
Hence, the interactions in the Monte Carlo simulations
are essentially 1D. Our DFT calculations, however, reveal
a much stronger interaction across the wires of order 1
meV. These may arise from the interaction of strain fields
from the UDBs but other sources may contribute as well.
Regardless of their origin, we turn now to investigating
their role in the order-disorder transition. We show next
that by including these 2D interactions, the FWHM at
all temperatures is brought into quantitatively excellent
agreement with experiment.
We constructed an exactly solvable Potts model Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of coupled wires and the
resulting steady-state FWHM of the ×3 peaks as a function of temperature:

where δi,j denotes the Kronecker delta. A single UDB can
take three positions within each unit cell i: left, center
and right, ui = {l, c, r}. The first term, with parameter b, describes the energy needed to displace neighbouring UDBs relative to each other: specifically, the energy
needed to create a soliton-antisoliton pair within one wire
is 2b. The second term, with parameter a, favors the
occupation of the central position and arises from the
coupling of the wire to neighboring wires. See Supplementary Material for additional details.
The model fits best to our experimental data for a =
2.1 meV and b = 21 meV. These fitted values are also
consistent with our DFT results: a should be equal to
the calculated energy difference per UDB, 2.1 meV, between (2,2,1) configurations in staggered and centered
alignments, and b corresponds to E0 /2 = 15 meV. In the
Supplementary Material, we derive analytical expressions
for the profiles and FWHM of the ×3 peaks as a function of temperature. The resulting FWHM, convolved
as above with a Gaussian, is now in excellent agreement
with our experimental results [black curve in Fig. 2(b)].
This improved agreement demonstrates that 2D coupling
between neighboring wires indeed plays an important,
central role in the order-disorder transition.
We turn now to the crossover from 2D to 1D behavior.
At temperatures above ∼120 K, the ×3 diffraction spots
are well described by a standard Lorentzian. At temperatures below ∼90 K, the 2D character of the diffraction
is more pronounced and hence the spot profiles are described by a Lorentzian to the power 3/2 [42]. To characterize the transition between these two limits, we fit the

where kk is the reciprocal space coordinate in the 1 1 0
direction, k0 is the position of the ×3 diffraction spot,
and Γ(x) is the Gamma function. The parameter ν =
(d+1)/2 characterizes the dimensionality d of the system:
ν = 3/2 describes 2D systems while ν = 1 describes 1D
systems [42–44]; we constrained ν to lie in this range.
We find that ν exhibits a well-defined transition from
1.5 to 1.0 between T− = 93 K and T+ = 128 K (Fig. 4).
The transition begins at about the temperature for
which the FWHM κk along the steps begins to increase
[Fig. 2(b)]. Fitting the spot profiles without allowing ν
to vary leads to significantly worse fits (insets to Fig. 4).
The transition is completed at T+ , where the FWHM κ⊥
across the wires exceeds the size of the surface Brillouin
zone [Fig. 2(a)], reflecting the complete loss of long-range
order across the wires. The underlying origin of this dimensional crossover is subtle but simple: the approximate geometrical isotropy of the 2D array of UDBs is
broken by the strong anisotropy of the energy scales for
creating disorder across and within the UDB wires. At
temperatures above T− soliton defects are still rare, but a
rapidly growing fraction of the wire rows undergoes registry shifts with respect to each other and hence the 2D
low-temperature state begins to behave like a collection
of uncoupled 1D wires. As the temperature approaches
T+ this crossover becomes nearly complete. See the Supplementary Material for additional discussion, modeling,
and analysis.
To summarize, we have shown that silicon dangling-

5
bond solitons in Si(553)-Au are created by thermal excitation. These defects interact via Coulomb forces within
each step-edge atomic wire and via another mechanism,
probably strain, across the wires. As the temperature is
raised, the resulting disorder destroys the ×3 positional
long-range order of the UDBs within each wire and their
registry across the wires. The nature of the interactions
and their respective energy scales create a dimensional
crossover of the order-disorder transition from 2D at low
temperature to 1D at high temperature. The generality
of this crossover can readily be investigated—both experimentally and using our theoretical methods—in other
atomic wire systems in the Ge/Si(hhk)-Au family, where
differences in the surface morphology and ground-state
electron configuration may lead to further expanding our
understanding of low-dimensional systems.
