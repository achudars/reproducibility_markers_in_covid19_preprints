Introduction

Nearrings are a generalization of associative rings in the sense that with the
respect to addition they need not be commutative and only one distributive
law is assumed. In this paper the concept “nearring” means a left distributive
nearring with a multiplicative identity. The reader is referred to the books by
Meldrum [6] or Pilz [8] for terminology, definitions and basic facts concerning
nearrings.

2
Following [3], the nearring with identity will be called local, if the set of
all non-invertible elements forms a subgroup of its additive group. The main
results concerning local nearrings are summarized in [11].
In [4] it is shown that every non-cyclic abelian p -group of order pn > 4 is
the additive group of a zero-symmetric local nearring which is not a ring. As
it was noted in [5], neither a generalized quaternion group nor a non-abelian
group of order 8 can be the additive group of a local nearring.
Therefore the structure of the non-abelian finite p -groups which are the
additive groups of local nearrings is an open problem [2].
It was proved that every non-metacyclic Miller–Moreno p -group of order
n
p > 8 is the additive group of a local nearring and the multiplicative group
of such a nearring is the group of order pn−1 (p − 1) [9]. In this paper finite
non-abelian non-metacyclic 2 -generated p -groups ( p > 2 ) of nilpotency
class 2 with cyclic commutator subgroup are studied.

Preliminaries

Let G be a finite non-abelian non-metacyclic 2 -generated p -group ( p > 2 )
of nilpotency class 2 with cyclic commutator subgroup.
Denote by G′ and Z(G) the commutator subgroup and the centre of G ,
respectively.
Let a and b be generators for G such that G/G′ = haG′ i × hbG′ i , aG′
has order pm and bG′ has order pn . Then c = [a, b] generates G′ , c has
n
m
order pd with 1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ m , and c ∈ Z(G) = hap , bp , ci .
Suppose that hai ∩ G′ = hbi ∩ G′ = 1 . Then
m

d

G = ha, b, c|ap = bp = cp = 1, ab = ac, ca = cb = ci
and each element of G can be uniquely written in the form ax1 bx2 cx3 , x1 ∈
Cpm , x2 ∈ Cpn , x3 ∈ Cpd . Therefore the group G with p > 2 will be
denoted by G(pm , pn , pd ) .
Lemma 1. For any natural numbers k and l the equality [ak , bl ] = ckl
holds.
Proof. Since b−1 ab = ac , it follows that b−l abl = acl . Therefore, b−l ak bl =
(acl )k = ak ckl , thus a−k b−l ak bl = ckl .

3
Corollary 1. Let the group G(pm , pn , pd ) be additively written. Then for
any natural numbers k and l the equalities −ak − bl + ak + bl = c(kl) and
bl + ak = −c(kl) + ak + bl hold.
Lemma 2. For any natural numbers k , l and r the equality
(ak bl )r = akr blr c−kl(2)
r

(∗)
holds.

Proof. For r = 1 , there is nothing to prove. By induction on r , we derive
(ak bl )r = akr blr c−kl(2) .
r

Replacing r by r + 1 in equality (∗) , we have
r
r
(ak bl )(r+1) = akr blr ak bl c−kl(2) = ak(r+1) bl(r+1) c−klr c−kl(2)

= ak(r+1) bl(r+1) c−kl(r+(2)) = ak(r+1) bl(r+1) ckl(
r

).

r+1

Thus, equality (∗) holds for an arbitrary r .
Corollary 2. Let the group G(pm , pn , pd ) be additively written. Then for
any natural numbers k , l and r the equality (ak + bl)r = akr + blr − ckl r2
holds.
Obviously, the exponent of G(pm , pn , pd ) is equal to pm for 1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ m .
Lemma 3. If x is an element of order pm of G(pm , pn , pd ) , then there exist
m
n
d
generators a , b , c of this group such that a = x and ap = bp = cp = 1 ,
ab = ac , ca = cb = c .
Proof. Indeed, for each x ∈ G(pm , pn , pd ) there exist positive integers α , β
and γ such that x = aα bβ cγ . Thus, we have

by Lemma 2. Since |a| = pm and 1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ m , where m > 1 and p > 2 ,
it follows that the exponent of G(pm , pn , pd ) equals pm .

then either (α, p) = 1 , or (β, p) = 1 for m = n , or (γ, p) = 1 for m = n =
d . So, without loss of generality, we can assume that (α, p) = 1 . Then
hx, bi = haα bβ cγ , bi = haα , bi = ha, bi = G
and
b−1 xb = b−1 (aα bβ cγ )b = (ac)α bβ cγ = (aα bβ cγ )cα = xcα .
Furthermore, substituting cα instead of c for generators x and b of G(pm , pn , pd ) ,
we have similar expressions as for generators a and b , thus replacing the
element a by x .
The following assertion concerning the automorphisms group of G(pm , pn , pd )
is a direct consequence of statement (B1) [7].
Lemma 4. Let G = G(pm , pn , pd ) and let Aut(G) be the automorphism
group of G . Then the following statements hold:
1) if m = n , then |Aut(G)| = p2d+4m−5 (p2 − 1)(p − 1) ;
2) if m > n , then |Aut(G)| = p2d+3n+m−2 (p − 1)2 .
An information about a group of automorphisms of G(pm , pm , pd ) is given
by the following lemma.
Lemma 5. Let G = G(pm , pm , pd ) and let there exist a subgroup A of AutG
of order p2m+d−2 (p2 − 1) , where m, d > 1 with odd p . If an element g ∈ G
of order pm and A contains Sylow normal p -subgroup, then G 6= g A ∪Φ(G) .
Proof. Assume that G = g A ∪ Φ(G) . Then G = (hai × hci) ⋊ hbi with
generators a , b of order pm and a central commutator c = [a, b] of order
pd by the definition. Hence
Φ(G) = (hap i × hci) ⋊ hbp i,
and thus all elements of order pm are contained in g A . Furthermore, a = g u
for some u ∈ A , hence g A = aA , i. e. G = aA ∪ Φ(G) . Since |G| = p2m+d
and Φ(G) = p2m+d−2 , it follows that
|aA | = |G| − |Φ(G)| = p2m+d−2 (p2 − 1),

5
and so the centralizer CA (a) of a in A equals 1 . In particular, (ahcp i)A =
(ahcp i)B = ahcp i for the normal subgroup B = CA (ahcp i) of order pd−1 in
A.
Considering the factor-group Ḡ = G/hcp i and Ā = A/B . Taking into
consideration, that |āĀ | = p2m−1 (p2 − 1) , we have Ḡ = āĀ ∪ Φ(Ḡ) . Since
|Φ(Ḡ)| = |Z(Ḡ)| and xy = yx for all x ∈ Φ(Ḡ) , y ∈ Ḡ , we have Φ(Ḡ) =
Z(Ḡ) . Therefore, Ḡ is a Miller–Moreno group. Since Ḡ = āĀ ∪ Z(Ḡ) , the
latter equality is impossible by [9, Lemma 7]. This contradiction completes
the proof.

Nearrings with identity on G(pm, pn, pd)

First recall some basic concepts of the theory of nearrings.
Definition 1. A set R with two binary operations “ +” and “ ·” is called a
(left) nearring if the following statements hold:
(1) (R, +) = R+ is a (not necessarily abelian) group with neutral element 0 ;
(2) (R, ·) is a semigroup;
(3) x(y + z) = xy + xz for all x , y , z ∈ R .
If R is a nearring, then the group R+ is called the additive group of R .
If in addition 0 · x = 0 , then the nearring R is called zero-symmetric and if
the semigroup (R, ·) is a monoid, i.e. it has an identity element i , then R
is a nearring with identity i . In the latter case the group R∗ of all invertible
elements of the monoid (R, ·) is called the multiplicative group of R .
The following assertion is well-known.
Lemma 6. Let R be a finite nearring with identity i . Then the exponent
of R+ is equal to the additive order of i which coincides with additive order
of every element of R∗ .
As a direct consequence of Lemmas 3 and 6 we have the following corollary.
Corollary 3. Let R be a nearring with identity i whose group R+ is isomorphic to a group G(pm , pn , pd ) . Then R+ = hai + hbi + hci with elements
a , b and c , satisfying relations apm = bpn = cpd = 0 , −b + a + b = a + c
and −a + c + a = −b + c + b = c with 1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ m , where a = i .

6
The following statement [10, Lemma 1] establishes the connection between the automorphism group of the additive group of the nearring with
identity and its multiplicative group.
Lemma 7. Let R be a nearring with identity i . Then there exists a subgroup A of the automorphism group AutR+ which is isomorphic to R∗ and
satisfying the condition iA = {ia | a ∈ A} = R∗ .
The subgroup A defined in Lemma 7 is called the automorphism group
of the group R+ associated with the group R∗ .
The following statement [11, Theorem 54] concerns the structure of L
which is the subgroup of all non-invertible elements of finite local nearring
R . Let Φ(G) denote the Frattini subgroup of G .
Theorem 1. Let R be a local nearring of order pn and let G(R) = R+ ⋊R∗
be a group associated with R . Then H = R+ ⋊ (i + L) is a Sylow normal
p -subgroup of G(R) and L = R+ ∩Φ(H) . In particular, if L is non-abelian,
then its center is non-cyclic.
Considering Φ(R+ ) ≤ Φ(H) , we have the following corollary.
Corollary 4. Φ(R+ ) ≤ L = Φ(H) ∩ R+ .
Let R be a nearring with identity i whose group R+ is isomorphic to a
group G(pm , pn , pd ) . Thus it follows from Corollary 3 that R+ = hai + hbi + hci
with elements a , b and c , satisfying relations apm = bpn = cpd = 0 ,
−b + a + b = a + c and −a + c + a = −b + c + b = c with 1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ m ,
where a = i and each element x ∈ R is uniquely written in the form
x = ax1 + bx2 + cx3 with coefficients 0 ≤ x1 < pm , 0 ≤ x2 < pn and
0 ≤ x3 < pd .
Furthermore, we can assume xa = ax = x for each x ∈ R and there
exist uniquely defined mappings α : R → Zpm , β : R → Zpn and γ : R → Zpd
such that
(∗∗)

xb = aα(x) + bβ(x) + cγ(x).

elements of R , then

and only if the nearring R is zero-symmetric;
(1) α(xy) ≡ x1 α(y) + α(x)β(y) ( mod pm ) ;

Proof. If R is a zero-symmetric nearring, then
0 = 0 · b = aα(0) + bβ(0) + cγ(0),
thus α(0) ≡ 0 ( mod pm ) , β(0) ≡ 0 ( mod pn ) and γ(0) ≡ 0 ( mod pd ) . On
the other hand, if the last congruences hold, then 0 · b = a · 0 + b · 0 + c · 0 = 0 .
Since a is the multiplicative identity in R , we have 0 · a = a · 0 = 0 .
Moreover, from the equality c = −a − b + a + b and the left distributive law
it follows that 0 · c = −0 · a − 0 · b + 0 · a + 0 · b = 0 , hence
0 · x = 0 · (ax1 + bx2 + cx3 ) = (0 · a)x1 + (0 · b)x2 + (0 · c)x3 = 0.
This proves statement (0).
Next, using (**) and Corollary 1, we obtain
xc = −xa − xb + xa + xb = −cx3 − bx2 − ax1 − cγ(x) − bβ(x) − aα(x)
+ax1 + bx2 + cx3 + aα(x) + bβ(x) + cγ(x)
= −bx2 − ax1 − bβ(x) − aα(x) + ax1 + bx2 + aα(x) + bβ(x)
= −bx2 + cx1 β(x) − bβ(x) − ax1 − a(α(x) − x1 ) + bx2 + aα(x) + bβ(x)
= cx1 β(x) − b(x2 + β(x)) − aα(x) + bx2 + aα(x) + bβ(x)
= cx1 β(x) − b(x2 + β(x)) − aα(x) − cx2 α(x) + aα(x) + bx2 + bβ(x)

8
= c(x1 β(x) − x2 α(x)) − b(x2 + β(x)) + bx2 + bβ(x) = c(x1 β(x) − x2 α(x)).
Therefore
xy = (ax1 + bx2 + cx3 )y1 + (aα(x) + bβ(x) + cγ(x))y2
+(cx1 β(x) − x2 α(x))y3 .
Corollary 2 implies that

Finally, the associativity of multiplication for all x , y ∈ R implies that

(xy)b = x(yb).
Thus

2)

(xy)b = aα(xy) + bβ(xy) + cγ(xy)

and yb = aα(y) + bβ(y) + cγ(y) by formula (**). Substituting the last
expression in the right part of equality 1), we get

Local nearrings on G(pm, pn, pd )

Let R be a local nearring with identity i whose group R+ is isomorphic
to the group G(pm , pn , pd ) . Then R+ = hai + hbi + hci with elements a , b
and c , satisfying relations apm = bpn = cpd = 0 , −b + a + b = a + c and
−a + c + a = −b + c + b = c with 1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ m , where a = i and each
element x ∈ R is uniquely written in the form x = ax1 + bx2 + cx3 with
coefficients 0 ≤ x1 < pm , 0 ≤ x2 < pn and 0 ≤ x3 < pd .
We show that the set L of all non-invertible elements of R is a subgroup
of index p in R+ .
Theorem 2. The following statements hold:
1. L = ha · pi + hbi + hci and, in particular, the subgroup L is of index
p in R+ and |R∗ | = pm+n+d−1 (p − 1) ;
2. x = ax1 +bx2 +cx3 is an invertible element if and only if x1 6≡ 0 ( mod p ) .
Proof. Assume that |R+ : L| = pt , t > 1 . Since R = R∗ ∪ L , it follows that
|R∗ | = |R| − |L| = pm+n+d − pm+n+d−t = pm+n+d−t (pt − 1).
According to Lemma 7, the group R∗ is isomorphic to the subgroup A of
the automorphism group of R+ and so |R∗ | divides |AutR+ | . According to
statement 1) of Lemma 4 it is possible only if t = 2 and m = n .
Assume that |R+ : L| = p2 and m = n . If d = 1 , then it is impossible
because of [9, Theorem 2]. Now let d > 1 . Since |R+ : Φ(R+ )| = p2
and Corollary 4, we have L = Φ(R+ ) . Hence by Lemma 7, we get R+ =
aA ∪ Φ(R+ ) , which is impossible by Lemma 5. This contradiction shows that
our assumption is false and so |R+ : L| = p .
It is clear that R/L is a nearfield and so the factor-group R+ /L+ is
an elementary abelian p -group. Thus for a ∈
/ L we have ap ∈ L and so
∗
L = ha · pi + hbi + hci . Therefore R = R \ L and hence
R∗ = {ax1 + bx2 + cx3 | x1 6≡ 0 ( mod p )}.

Applying statement (1) of Theorem 2 to Lemma 8, we get the following
formula for multiplying elements x = ax1 + bx2 + cx3 and y = ay1 + by2 + cy3
in the local nearring R .

Corollary 5. If x , y ∈ R with 1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ m and xb = aα(x) + bβ(x) +

and only if the nearring R is zero-symmetric;
(1) α(x) ≡ 0 ( mod p) ;
(2) if β(x) ≡ 0 ( mod p) , then x1 ≡ 0 ( mod p) ;
(3) α(xy) ≡ x1 α(y) + α(x)β(y) ( mod pm ) ;
(4) β(xy) ≡ x2 α(y) + β(x)β(y) ( mod pn ) ;

+x3 α(y) + γ(x)β(y) + x1 β(x)γ(y) − x2 α(x)γ(y) ( mod pd ).

Proof. Indeed, statements (0), (3)–(5) repeat statements (0)–(4) of Lemma 8.
Since L = ha · pi + hbi + hci by Theorem 2 and L is an (R, R) -subgroup
in R by statement 2) [1, Lemma 3.2], it follows that xb ∈ L and hence
α(x) ≡ 0 ( mod p) , proving statement (1). Taking y = c , we have xc =
c(x1 β(x)−x2 α(x)) . Thus, if β(x) ≡ 0 ( mod p) , then xc = 0 ( mod p ) , and
so x ∈ L . Thus x1 ≡ 0 ( mod p) by Theorem 2, proving statement (2).
The following theorem shows that conditions given in Theorem 2 are
sufficient for existing of finite local nearrings on G(pm , pn , pd ) . Moreover,
each group G(pm , pn , pd ) is the additive group of a nearring with identity.
Theorem 3. For each prime p and positive integers m , n and d with
1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ m there exists a local nearring R whose additive group R+ is
isomorphic to the group G(pm , pn , pd ) .

11
Proof. Let R be an additively written group G(pm , pn , pd ) with generators
a , b and c satisfying the relations |a| = pm , |b| = pn , |c| = pd , b−1 ab = ac
and a−1 ca = b−1 cb = c . Then G = hai + hbi + hci and each element x ∈ R
is uniquely written in the form x = ax1 + bx2 + cx3 with coefficients 0 ≤
x1 < pm , 0 ≤ x2 < pn and 0 ≤ x3 < pd . In order to define a multiplication
“ · ” on R in such a manner that (R, +, ·) is a local nearring.
Assume that 1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ m and let the mappings from Corollary 5 be
defined by the congruences α(x) ≡ 0 ( mod pm ) , β(x) ≡ x1 ( mod pn ) and
γ(x) ≡ 0 ( mod pd ) for each x ∈ G . Then
 
y1
+ x3 y1 + x21 y3 ).
x · y = ax1 y1 + b(x2 y1 + x1 y2 ) + c(−x1 x2
2
It suffices to show that the mappings α : G → Zpm , β : G → Zpn and
γ : G → Zpd with respect to the multiplication “ · ” satisfy statements (0)–(5)
of Corollary 5.
Indeed, α(0) ≡ 0 ( mod pm ) , β(0) ≡ 0 ( mod pn ) and γ(0) ≡ 0 ( mod pd )
by the definition. Since 0 · y = a · 0 + b · 0 + c · 0 = 0 for each y ∈ G ,
this implies that a multiplication “ · ” is zero-symmetric and so, proving
statement (0) of Corollary 5. Indeed, we have α(x) ≡ 0 ( mod p) and
x1 ≡ 0 ( mod p) , if β(x) ≡ 0 ( mod p) , so that statements (1) and (2) of
Corollary 5 hold. Clearly, we derive statements (3)–(5) of Corollary 5.
As corollary we have the following assertion.
Corollary 6. Each group G(pm , pn , pd ) is the additive group of a nearring
with identity.
