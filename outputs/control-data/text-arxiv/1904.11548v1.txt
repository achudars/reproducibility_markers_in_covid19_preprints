ABSTRACT

Through high-precision radio timing observations, we show that five recycled pulsars in
the direction of the Galactic Centre (GC) have anomalous spin period time derivative
(Ṗ ) measurements – PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819, J1757−2745, and J1804−2858
show negative values of Ṗ and PSR J1801−3210 is found to have an exceptionally
small value of Ṗ . We attribute these observed Ṗ measurements to acceleration of
these pulsars along their lines-of-sight (LOSs) due to the Galactic gravitational field.
Using models of the Galactic mass distribution and pulsar velocities, we constrain the
distances to these pulsars, placing them on the far-side of the Galaxy, providing the
first accurate distance measurements to pulsars located in this region and allowing us
to consider the electron density along these LOSs. We find the new electron density
model YMW16 to be more consistent with these observations than the previous model
NE2001. The LOS dynamics further constrain the model-dependent intrinsic Ṗ values
for these pulsars and they are consistent with measurements for other known pulsars.
In the future, the independent distance measurements to these and other pulsars
near the GC would allow us to constrain the Galactic gravitational potential more
accurately.

INTRODUCTION

Pulsars are among the most reliable macroscopic periodic
sources in the universe and their long-term stability is comparable to that of atomic clocks (e.g. Petit & Tavella 1996;
Hobbs et al. 2012). This allows the parameters of pulsars to
be measured to exquisite precision through measuring and
modelling the arrival times of their pulses (e.g. Kaspi et al.
1994). These measurements are sensitive to any dynami⋆

cal changes caused by external forces on the pulsar such
as the gravitational forces exerted by other masses (e.g.
Freire et al. 2017; Perera et al. 2017).
Pulsars are thought to be powered by the loss of rotational kinetic energy and thus, gradually spin down over
time, leading to positive values of Ṗ . The current pulsar
population strongly supports this hypothesis with measured
positive Ṗ values for the vast majority of pulsars1 (see

Perera et al.

Manchester et al. 2005). However, some pulsars, located in
globular clusters, show significant negative Ṗ measurements
(e.g Wolszczan et al. 1989; Freire et al. 2017; Jacoby et al.
2006; Corongiu et al. 2006; Lynch et al. 2012). These Ṗ values are not entirely intrinsic, but induced by the dynamics
due to the LOS component of the acceleration of the pulsar, mainly in the gravitational potential of the cluster itself, locating them on the far-side of the cluster (see, e.g.,
Freire et al. 2003, 2017).
Similar to the globular clusters, the Galaxy has a
strong gravitational potential within the central regions
due to the high stellar and gas densities. We therefore expect negative Ṗ measurements from pulsars that
are located near the Galactic centre (GC) on the farside of the Galaxy (see § 5.1 for details). However,
prior to this work, there was no conclusive evidence for
this. As we show below using our timing observations,
PSRs J1748−3009 (Knispel et al. 2013), J1753−2819 (originally announced by Mickaliger 2013), J1757−2745 (Ng et al.
2015), and J1804−2858 (Morello et al. 2019, Barr et al., in
prep) all show significant negative Ṗ measurements, and
PSR J1801−3210 (Ng et al. 2014) shows a remarkably small
but positive Ṗ measurement when compared to the known
pulsar population.
In addition to the pulsars listed above, we note that
our timing of PSR J1746−2758 (Ng et al. 2015) does not
show an unusual Ṗ measurement, however, its location in
the Galaxy and some measured properties have similarities
to those of above mentioned pulsars, making it useful to
consider in this work. The previously reported rotational,
and some other measured and derived parameters, for these
pulsars are given in Table 1, noting that four of them had
no previous Ṗ measurements. All six pulsars considered here
are located along LOSs which pass near the GC with an
angular separation of < 5◦ . With their comparably large
dispersion measure (DM – which accounts for the frequencydependent time delay of the radio pulses due to electrons in
the inter-stellar medium along the LOS) values, it is likely
that these pulsars are located within the inner regions of
the Galaxy around the GC (Cordes & Lazio 2002; Yao et al.
2017). Given the special locations of these pulsars, it is likely
that their unusual observed Ṗ measurements are not entirely
intrinsic, but rather induced by the pulsar acceleration in the
Galactic gravitational potential. We further note that these
pulsars are useful in studying the DM environment of the
inner region of the Galaxy.
The paper is organized as follows. In § 2, we describe
the discovery observations of PSR J1753−2819. In § 3, we
present our observations and data processing of all six pulsars. We then discuss the timing analysis of these pulsars
in § 4 and report their negative/small observed Ṗ measurements. We analyse their dynamics in § 5, including the LOS
accelerations combining the Galactic mass distribution and
pulsar velocity models (§ 5.1 and 5.2), leading to limits on
their intrinsic Ṗ values (§ 5.3) and their possible distances
(§ 5.4). We compare our dynamically-derived distances with
DM-derived distances obtained using electron density models in § 5.5. Finally in § 6, we discuss our results and present
conclusions.

DISCOVERY OF PSR J1753−2819

The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey (PMPS –
Manchester et al. 2001) has significantly expanded the
known pulsar population, resulting in over 800 new pulsar
discoveries to-date (Morris et al. 2002; Kramer et al. 2003;
Hobbs et al. 2004a; Faulkner et al. 2004; Lorimer et al.
2006; Eatough et al. 2009, 2010, 2013; Keith et al. 2009;
Mickaliger et al. 2012; Knispel et al. 2013), including 21
millisecond pulsars and 30 rotating radio transients. The
PMPS was carried out as a blind pulsar survey along the
Galactic plane with |b| < 5◦ using the 13-beam multibeam
receiver (with a centre frequency of 1374 MHz and a
bandwidth of 288 MHz) on the Parkes radio telescope
(PKS) in Australia. Due to advanced and improved pulsar
search pipelines being applied to the archival PMPS data,
and independent visual inspection of the candidate output
plots, five new millisecond pulsars were discovered and
reported by Mickaliger et al. (2012).
These methods also resulted in the discovery of
PSR J1753−2819 (originally announced by Mickaliger 2013).
As described by Mickaliger et al. (2012), the PMPS data
were initially dedispersed using dedisperse all2 , a multithreaded dedisperser compatible with the sigproc software package (Lorimer 2011). The resulting time series were
then searched using seek3 . For statistically significant candidates, the raw data were folded at the candidate period using prepfold from the presto software package4
(Ransom 2011). The number of candidates was reduced by
selecting those within a parameter space from which pulsars were likely to have been previously missed, i.e. spin
period P < 50 ms, DM > 10 pc cm−3 . The resulting folded
candidates were viewed by eye and confirmation observations were performed and were reported by Mickaliger et al.
(2012). This search was undertaken as part of a larger
search for fast radio bursts, which classified single pulses
from known pulsars detected in the PMPS (Mickaliger et al.
2018). Like the five pulsars reported in Mickaliger et al.
(2012), PSR J1753−2819 was probably missed in earlier
searches of the PMPS due to its high DM, short spin period,
and binary nature, as well as the large number of candidates
present in those searches. Further details of the search are
reported in Mickaliger et al. (2012).

OBSERVATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING

We observed PSRs J1748−3009, J1746−2758, J1757−2745,
J1801−3210, and J1804−2858 using the Lovell Telescope
(LT) at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in the UK approximately monthly or semi-monthly since their discoveries. After confirming the discovery of PSR J1753−2819, it was
observed using the LT approximately every 17 days. All
these observations were carried out at ‘L band’ at a centre frequency of 1532 MHz and a bandwidth of 400 MHz.
The data were recorded using the ‘ROACH’ pulsar backend
(Bassa et al. 2016a). The observation details are given in Table 2. In addition to the ROACH data sets, PSR J1801−3210

was observed using the LT with the ‘DFB’ backend between February 2010 and April 2011. The ‘DFB’ observations were carried out at a slightly different centre frequency
of 1520 MHz and a bandwidth of 384 MHz. We used both
data sets of this pulsar in the analysis to extend its time
baseline.
In addition to the LT observations, PSRs J1801−3210
and J1804−2858 were observed using the Parkes radio telescope since their discoveries. These observations were also
taken at ‘L band’ with a centre frequency of 1369 MHz and
a bandwidth of 400 MHz and recorded with the CASPSR
backend (see Table 2). We noticed that some of the calibration observations obtained from PKS as a part of PMPS in
the period between December 1998 and August 2001 happened to overlap with the position of PSR J1748−3009, that
is, prior to its discovery. Therefore, we used these data and
folded them using the pulsar ephemeris and included the
resultant detections in our timing analysis. These observations were carried out at 1374 MHz with a bandwidth
of 288 MHz and recorded using the ‘analogue filter bank’
(AFB) backend. When combined with the existing data set
this extended the observation baseline of PSR J1748−3009
by more than 13 years, we were able to significantly improve
the timing measurements while fitting for new timing model
parameters (see § 4).
We processed these data using the pulsar analysis software package psrchive5 (Hotan et al. 2004;
van Straten et al. 2012, 2011). We folded each observation for its entire length and summed all the frequency
channels together to form the integrated pulse profile. A
time-of-arrival (TOA) was generated by cross-correlating
each of the integrated pulse profiles with a noise-free
profile template (Taylor 1992) using pat6 in psrchive.
This resulted in 83, 169, 98, 75, 187, and 101 TOAs for

Fig. 1 shows the integrated pulse profile of
PSR J1753−2819 as it was not published in the original announcement (Mickaliger 2013). We estimate the flux
density of the pulsar using the radiometer equation (see
Lorimer & Kramer 2005), with the system temperature
of Tsys = 42 K (i.e. Tsky = 12 K in the direction of the
pulsar according to Haslam et al. (1982) with a spectral
index of −2.6 and Trec + Tspill = 30 K) and the telescope
gain of 0.9 K/Jy, and scale the profile accordingly. These
calculations estimate the mean flux density of the pulsar
to be 0.14 mJy. We further measure the pulse width,
at 50% and 10% of the peak to be W50 = 1.51 ms and
W10 = 3.98 ms, respectively.

TIMING PULSARS

We fit timing models including astrometric and rotational
frequency parameters for PSRs J1746−2758, J1748−3009,
J1753−2819, J1757−2745, J1801−3210, and J1804−2858 to
the TOAs. The timing solutions are improved by minimising the χ2 value of the timing residuals between the observed and model-predicted TOAs using the pulsar timing software tempo2 (Edwards et al. 2006; Hobbs et al.
2006; Hobbs & Edwards 2012). Since we do not have multifrequency observations, we keep the DM of the pulsar fixed
at its previously published value (see Table 1). Note that
PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819, and J1801−3210 are in binary orbits and thus, we include Keplerian parameters in
their timing models (see Lorimer & Kramer 2005) using the
binary model ‘BT’ (Blandford & Teukolsky 1976). When
TOAs from different telescopes/backends are available (see
Table 2), we combined them by fitting for a time offset
(‘JUMP’) in the timing model of the pulsar to take into
account any systematic delays between the data sets. During the fitting process, the topocentric TOAs are converted
to the Solar-system barycentric coordinate time (TCB) using the DE4367 ephemeris (Folkner et al. 2009) and placed
on the Terrestrial Time standard BIPM20158 . The resultant
timing parameters of our pulsars are given in Table 3 and 4.

4.1

PSR J1748−3009

This binary millisecond pulsar has a spin period of 9.7 ms
and is located with an angular separation of 1.◦ 36 from the
GC (see Table 5). Based on about 20 years of our timing
data, by combining the early PKS observations with LT observations, the timing parameters of the pulsar improved significantly. The timing model constrains the Ṗ measurement
of the pulsar for the first time to be −3.580(2) × 10−20 s/s.
This negative value indicates that the measured Ṗ is not
entirely intrinsic, rather induced by the acceleration of the
pulsar due to the Galactic potential, and we constrain the
limit on the intrinsic value based on dynamics in § 5.3. We

Folkner et al. (2014).
8 This time standard has been obtained according to principles
given in Guinot (1988) and Petit (2003).

further find that the timing solution of the pulsar requires a
second time derivative of the rotational frequency (f¨), with
an approximately 7σ significance (see Table 3), to achieve
white residuals. Our timing analysis also places a limit on
the orbital period time derivative Ṗb of the pulsar with a
significance of 2.6σ. We use this limit independently to further constrain the intrinsic period derivative of the pulsar
in § 5.3.

4.2

PSR J1753−2819

The newly discovered PSR J1753−2819 (Mickaliger 2013) is
a 18.6 ms mildly-recycled pulsar in a 9.3-hr binary orbit (see
Table 3) with a DM of 298 cm−3 pc. It is located at an angular separation of 1.◦ 92 from the GC, resulting in a projected
separation of 275 pc in the sky-plane at the distance of the
GC (see Table 5). Initial timing observations during the discovery showed a mild evidence for a negative Ṗ , and the
current value is measured to be −4.94(2) × 10−20 s/s based
on our 6 years of LT observations. This negative Ṗ value indicates that this measurement is also affected by the pulsar
dynamics in the Galactic potential (see § 5.3).

4.3

PSR J1757−2745

PSR J1757−2745 is an isolated mildly-recycled pulsar with
a spin period of 17.7 ms and located at an angular separation of 2.◦ 95 from the GC (see Table 5). Our 4.5 years of
observations improved its timing solution, updating the Ṗ
measurement to be −1.30(2) × 10−20 s/s (see Table 4). This
negative value indicates that this Ṗ measurement is also affected by the pulsar dynamics in the Galactic potential, and
we study this in detail (see § 5.3). The timing analysis also
places a limit on the proper motion, particularly in Right
Ascension (see Table 4).
The previous timing analysis of this pulsar reported a
Ṗ measurement of 2.1(2) × 10−19 s/s (Ng et al. 2015) based
on a short time span of 206 days. However, we now confirm
that this value is not correct due to the short data span
and resultant large covariance between the rotational and
astrometric parameters.

PSR J1801−3210

PSR J1801−3210 has a spin period of 7.45 ms and is located
at an angular separation of 4.◦ 7 from the GC (see Table 5).
As shown in Table 4 based on our 9 yr data set, we find
improved timing parameters of the pulsar, indicating that Ṗ
measurement is constrained to be a positive value of 7.4(8)×
10−23 s/s. This measurement is still smaller than the lowest
positive Ṗ measured to-date for any known pulsar9 .
The previous timing analysis of this pulsar showed a
low-significance Ṗ measurement of −4(4) × 10−23 s/s based
on a 4 yr long data set (Ng et al. 2014). They argued that the
pulsar is possibly located behind the sky-plane which passes
through the GC along the LOS. In that case the negative
Galactic acceleration affects the positive intrinsic spin-down
of the pulsar and results in an extremely low measured Ṗ
value (see § 5.1 for details). Although the DM-derived distance from the NE2001 electron density model places the
pulsar in front of the sky-plane (see Table 1), they argued
that the electron density models can contain large uncertainties. Therefore, our exceptionally small Ṗ measurement
indicates the scenario of the pulsar being located behind the
sky-plane through the GC proposed by Ng et al. (2014) is
still valid (which we will show independently in § 5.4).

PSR J1804−2858

PSR J1804−2858 is a solitary millisecond pulsar and has
the third lowest spin period known to-date, a spin period
of 1.49 ms (Morello et al. 2019, Barr et al., in prep). It is
located at an angular radius of 4◦ from the GC (Table 5)
and the DM is 232 cm−3 pc, which places the pulsar at a
distance of 8.2 kpc from the Earth based on the YMW16
electron density model (see Table 1). The discovery analysis
of the pulsar did not have a Ṗ measurement, however our
4.3 years of timing data measures a significant Ṗ value of
−7.57(2) × 10−22 s/s (see Table 4). As mentioned above for
other pulsars, this measured Ṗ value is not entirely intrinsic,
rather induced by the acceleration of the pulsar along its
LOS due to the Galactic potential. We study its dynamics
in detail combining with the Galactic mass distribution and
constrain the intrinsic Ṗ value in § 5.3.

PSR J1746−2758

This isolated 0.49-s spin period pulsar has an angular separation of just 0.◦ 96 from the GC (see Table 5). Our updated
timing solution based on more than four years of observations indicates a Ṗ measurement for the first time to be
4.42(5) × 10−18 s/s (see Table 3). Comparing this measurement with Ṗ values of known pulsars that have a similar

is calculated based on the Galactocentric coordinates (l, b). The uncertainties of l, b, and θ are estimated based on the uncertainties
of pulsar positions measured from timing (Table 3 and 4). The projected separation r⊥ of the pulsar from the GC in the sky plane
is calculated based on a GC distance of 8.2 ± 0.1 kpc from the Sun (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2019). Note that the uncertainty in r⊥ is
dominated by the uncertainty in the GC distance.

pulse period, it is evident that this value is slightly smaller
than the majority, but within the distribution. On the other
hand, one can imagine, given the pulsar’s location, that it
is closer to the GC than the DM-derived distance (see Table 1) and thus, the measured Ṗ is not entirely intrinsic, but
rather induced by the Galactic potential. However, such a
claim is not likely to be straightforward. Further note that
the maximum Galactic acceleration in the direction of the
pulsar is greater than the measured Ṗ /P and thus, we study
its dynamics due to the Galactic potential in § 5.3 in detail.

DYNAMICS OF PULSARS

The timing models for PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819,
J1757−2745, and J1804−2858 show negative observed Ṗ
measurements (see § 4), indicating that these values are not
entirely intrinsic and have a dynamic contribution. We also
note that the observed Ṗ of PSR J1801−3210 is extremely
small, so that it is also likely to be affected by dynamics
(see § 4.4). In this section, we model the observed unusual
Ṗ measurements as being due to acceleration of these pulsars along their LOSs, and then constrain their intrinsic Ṗ
values and possible distances.

where, Ṗobs and Ṗint are the observed and intrinsic spin
period derivatives, respectively, a is the LOS acceleration of the pulsar with respect to the Sun due to the 3dimensional Galactic potential, aµ is the acceleration due
to transverse motion of the pulsar (i.e. the Shklovskii effect – Shklovskii 1970), and c is the speed of light. In
previous studies, a/c is computed as two separate components, namely the parallel component in the Galactic plane
and the vertical component towards the Galactic plane (see
Damour & Taylor 1991; Nice & Taylor 1995; Bassa et al.
2016b; Desvignes et al. 2016; Lazaridis et al. 2009). These
components were estimated separately based on Galactic rotation curve models and Galactic vertical acceleration models for a given (l, b) of a pulsar using the Galactocentric distance of the solar system R⊙ , the circular rotational speed
of the Galaxy at R⊙ , and the pulsar distance. Since the location of the Sun is only 25 ± 5 pc above the Galactic plane
(Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard 2016; Bland-Hawthorn et al.
2019), its vertical acceleration towards the plane is very
small and neglected in general (e.g. Damour & Taylor 1991).
In contrast, we directly use 3-dimensional Galactic mass
distribution models (see § 5.2) and thus, estimate the 3dimensional acceleration of the pulsar and the Sun separately at their locations in the Galaxy. We then use these
acceleration terms to compute the relative acceleration a/c
of the pulsar along its LOS with respect to the Sun. We note
that the acceleration of the Sun is insignificant compared to
that of the pulsar when the pulsar is located near the GC.
We describe the Galactic mass distribution models used in
this study and the estimation of a/c in § 5.2.
The Shklovskii effect can be written as aµ /c = vT2 /cd
(≡ µ2 d/c), where vT and µ are the transverse velocity and
the proper motions of the pulsar with respect to the Sun,
respectively, and d is the pulsar distance (Shklovskii 1970).
Our timing solutions do not measure significant proper motions of the pulsars considered here, rather place limits (see
Table 3 and 4). Thus, we assume typical pulsar properties
to estimate this term. We note that the velocity of a pulsar
is an intrinsic property of the source and the proper motion is an observed measurement that depends on the pulsar distance and the relative motion of the pulsar and the
Sun. Therefore, we use typical pulsar 3-dimensional peculiar
velocities and then estimate the expected aµ /c. In general,
young pulsars have higher 3-dimensional velocities compared
to millisecond pulsars (Lyne et al. 1998). Therefore, we assume a typical value of 100 km/s, which is consistent with
the millisecond pulsar population (e.g. Gonzalez et al. 2011;
Matthews et al. 2016), and 320 km/s, which is consistent
with the ordinary pulsar population (e.g. Hobbs et al. 2005;
Verbunt et al. 2017), in this study. We describe our calculation of aµ /c in Appendix A in detail. We note that if the
actual velocity of the pulsar is small, then the aµ /c contriMNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

as r⊥ tan(θ).

vice-versa (see Eq. 1).
The Galactic term a/c has both positive and negative
signs depending on the source location along the LOS in
the Galaxy. When the source is located behind (or in front
of) the sky-plane which passes through the GC, then a/c
becomes negative (or positive). We note that the Shklovskii
term aµ /c is always positive. Given that the intrinsic Ṗ is
positive, the pulsar must be located behind the sky-plane in
order to explain any observed negative Ṗ , and the observed
Ṗ /P should be dominated by the Galactic contribution (see
Eq. 1). A schematic diagram of the geometry used in this
study and the definitions are given in Fig. 2.

Galactic mass distribution models and pulsar
line-of-sight acceleration

We use the Galactic mass distribution model proposed in
Sofue (2013, 2017) in our analysis to estimate a/c. They
analysed high-resolution longitude-velocity diagrams of the
Galaxy and constructed the rotation curve including the
central black hole. Then they deconvolved the rotation curve
and fit several components to the observed velocities across
the Galaxy, resulting in two exponential-spherical bulges
(i.e. inner and main bulges), an exponential flat disk, and
a Navarro-Frenk-White (Navarro et al. 1996) dark halo. Using this information, Sofue (2013) modelled the volume mass
density of each component and then the mass distribution

8

Perera et al.

of the Galaxy (see Table 6 in Sofue 2017, for updated values). This study used observations covering the inner region
(from ∼1 pc) of the Galaxy and thus, required several bulge
components to appropriately model the data.
For comparison, we also use the Galactic mass distribution model proposed by McMillan (2017). This model uses
a main bulge, two stellar discs, two gas discs, and a dark
halo. The McMillan (2017) model is an improved version of
their previous model (McMillan 2011) which now includes
gas discs and uses new observations of maser sources in the
Galaxy. We note that these models mainly focus on the region beyond the bulge (where r⊥ > 1 kpc) in the Galaxy.
Since our pulsars are likely located around the central region
of the Galaxy (within a r⊥ < 1 kpc, see Table 5), we use the
Sofue (2013) model with updated parameters given in Sofue
(2017) as our main Galactic mass distribution model in the
analysis.
Throughout the analysis, we assume the Galactocentric distance of the solar system to be R⊙ = 8.2 ±
0.1 kpc and the central black hole mass to be (4.2 ±
0.2) × 106 M⊙ (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2019; Vasiliev
2019; Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard 2016; Sofue 2013, 2017;
McMillan 2017). These values are consistent with those derived in previous studies within their uncertainties (e.g.
Genzel et al. 2000; Ghez et al. 2005, 2008; Gillessen et al.
2009; Reid et al. 2009; Honma et al. 2012; Schönrich 2012;
Brunthaler et al. 2011; Reid et al. 2014). We further note
that this R⊙ is broadly consistent with the recently measured GC distance, which has an uncertainty of only 0.3%
(Abuter et al. 2019).
To be consistent with the above Galactic models (Sofue
2013; McMillan 2017), we define the volume mass density
of the bulge component in cylindrical Galactocentric coordinates
ρ0,b
ρb (R, z) =
exp[−(r/rcut )ζ ],

two bulges with ζ = 1, α = 0, r0 = 1 kpc, and q = 1
(i.e. spherically symmetric assumption), while McMillan
(2017) includes a single bulge with ζ = 2, α = 1.8, r0 =
0.075 kpc, and q = 0.5 (i.e. an axially symmetric assumption). All best-fit parameter values in their models are given

best-fit values for the above parameters are given in Sofue
(2017) and McMillan (2017), and also in Table 6 of this
study.
Using the above components and the central BH, we
estimate the total volume mass density of the Galaxy as a
function of radius R (see the top panel in Fig. 3). Based
on mass density, we then estimate the mass distribution
(i.e. the total mass interior to a given radius R) of the
Galaxy (see the bottom panel in Fig. 3). For further comparison, we also use previously published Galactic mass
distribution models (Piffl et al. 2014; Binney & Tremaine
2008; Dehnen & Binney 1998) with their best fit parameters and calculate the volume mass density and the mass
distribution as a function of radius (see Fig. 3). It can be
seen that all these additional models were focused on the
regions beyond the bulge and thus, derive similar variations in their density and mass curves to those derived from
McMillan (2017) model. We note that the Galactic models
in Dehnen & Binney (1998) are derived for the outer Galaxy
and thus, its density and mass estimates are not meaningful
at radii R . 8 kpc. As shown in Fig. 3, the model derived in
Sofue (2013) provides more features and better constraints
within the inner region of the Galaxy, particularly in the
bulges where our pulsars are likely to be located.
We further note that some Galactic mass models suggest that there is a need for a “barred bulge” component in
the central region of the Galaxy (e.g., McWilliam & Zoccali
2010; Nataf et al. 2010; Gardner & Flynn 2010; Ness et al.
2012). These models are non-axisymmetric and are typically computationally expensive to implement. By comparMNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

Dynamics of Galactic centre pulsars

Figure 3. The volume mass density (top) and the mass distribution (bottom – i.e. the mass interior to radius R) of the Galaxy as a
function of radius R measured from the GC. The different colours
show the different Galactic models used. Note that the Sofue
(2013) model with updated values given in Sofue (2017) provides
better constraints within the inner Galaxy, in particular in the
bulge regions. Other models mainly focus on the regions beyond
the bulge and follow similar constraints. The Dehnen & Binney
(1998) models were derived for the outer Galaxy and thus, they do
not provide meaningful results when R .8 kpc. Since the Galactic central BH is included in all models, their mass distributions
converge to the BH mass of 4.2 × 106 M⊙ when R → 0. We use
Sofue (2013) as our main model to constrain the properties of our
pulsars.

ing the Sofue (2013) model and the bar/bulge model given in
Portail et al. (2017), we noticed that the mass distribution
at a given radius of the two models are consistent with each
other. Compared to an axially symmetric model, a bar/bulge
model can cause a slight difference in the Galactic gravitational potential along the LOS of the pulsar depending on
the orientation of the bar component, leading to a slight
change in our results. However, this change is within the uncertainties of our estimated Ṗint values and pulsar distances.
Therefore, we simply use the above mentioned axially symmetric Galactic mass models in this study.
We first calculate the gravitational potential Φ at the
pulsar location (R, z) due to the Galactic mass distribution,
and then estimate the Galactic acceleration in R and z directions, namely −dΦ/dR and −dΦ/dz. To do this, we use the
computer software GalPot10 (McMillan 2017, 2016), which
computes the Galactic potential and the acceleration for any
given Galactic mass distribution model. This software was
based on Dehnen & Binney (1998) and the details of the
computation are given in McMillan (2017). We note that
10

since all these Galactic mass models are axially symmetric
(see Eq. 2 – 5), the acceleration does not depend on the
azimuthal angle. Once the acceleration components of the
pulsar and the Sun at their given locations in the Galaxy in
R and z directions are computed, we can estimate the relative LOS acceleration a/c of the pulsar with respect to the
Sun (see § 5.1). The acceleration a/c varies with the distance
to the pulsar, providing a negative (or positive) value when
the pulsar is located behind (or in front of) the sky-plane.
We estimate the maximum possible LOS acceleration curves amax /c due to the Galactic potential as
a function of Galactic longitude for a given Galactic
latitude (see Fig. 4). We plot the absolute values of
|Ṗobs /P | of PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819, J1757−2745,
and J1804−2858 in the figure. Due to the axially symmetric
mass distribution and the acceleration, we map the pulsars
that are located in the fourth quadrant of the Galaxy in the
first quadrant and include their Ṗobs /P in the figure. It is evident that, as shown in Fig. 4, all our six PSRs J1746−2758,
J1748−3009, J1753−2819, J1757−2745, J1801−3210, and
J1804−2858 have much lower |Ṗobs /P | than the maximum
Galactic accelerations along their LOSs obtained from our
main Galactic model (Sofue 2013). Therefore, we cannot
simply neglect the Galactic contribution in their observed
Ṗ . We investigate the LOS accelerations of these pulsars
in detail in § 5.3, leading to limits on their intrinsic Ṗ
values. Fig. 4 also shows that most of the known pulsars
that are located within the same field of view have much
larger Ṗobs /P compared to their Galactic maximum accelerations. If their Shklovskii terms are small, we can simply assume that the observed Ṗ measurements of these
pulsars are approximately equal to their intrinsic values.
In addition, PSRs J1723−2837, J1727−2946, J1751−2857,
and J1804−2717 have observed Ṗobs /P that are comparable to the maximum Galactic accelerations along their
LOSs (see black dots in Fig. 4). We note that the DM
measurements of these pulsars are relatively small (between 19 − 60 cm−3 pc; Hobbs et al. 2004b; Crawford et al.
2013; Lorimer et al. 2015; Desvignes et al. 2016) compared
to those of our pulsars in the analysis (see Table 1). The DMderived distances (using YMW16 model) to these pulsars are
in the range of 0.72 − 1.9 kpc (note that the NE2001 model
derived distances are also in a similar range). This indicates
that they are located close to the Sun and thus, the Galactic contributions in their observed Ṗ values are insignificant,
which means that the observed Ṗ values are approximately
equal to their intrinsic values.

Constraining the intrinsic period derivatives
of pulsars

We know that Ṗint and thus, Ṗint /P , of a non-accreting
pulsar is positive. As described before, aµ /c is a positive
contribution and thus, the measured negative Ṗobs measurements of PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819, J1757−2745,
and J1804−2858 can only be explained with a negative a/c
Galactic contribution (see Eq. 1). Using a Galactic model
as shown in § 5.2, we can compute the minimum possible
Galactic acceleration (amin /c) along a given LOS. Therefore, we can write the upper limit of the intrinsic period

The minimum Galactic acceleration amin /c is obtained from the
Galactic model given in Sofue (2013). The model-dependent upper limit on the intrinsic Ṗ is derived using Eq. 6 (see § 5.3).
The last column represents the model-dependent distance to the
pulsar determined through dynamics as described in § 5.4. Note

pulsars (grey dots), and marked them with black dots and include
their names in black if they are comparable (less than a factor of
four) to the model-dependent maximum acceleration. Note that if
the pulsar is located in the fourth quadrant of l, then we plotted

given in McMillan (2017).

using Eq. 1. We first estimate the Galactic acceleration
curves of these pulsars along their LOSs and plot in Fig. 5.
We then estimate aµ /c assuming the pulsar moves with
a space velocity of either 100 km/s (black dashed line) or
320 km/s (black dotted line) and over-plot in the same figure. For clarity, the x-axis in Fig. 5 represents the distance
L measured from the sky-plane (see Fig. 2 for definitions).
Appendix A describes the calculation of aµ /c in detail. We
then estimate the model-dependent upper limit on the intrinsic Ṗ of PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819, J1757−2745,
and J1804−2858 using Eq. 6 with the Galactic accelerations
shown in Fig. 5. The estimated limits are given in Table 7.
PSRs J1757−2745 and J1804−2858 have measured values
on their proper motions (see Table 4). For comparison, we
estimate the Shklovskii contribution based on these measured proper motions in Right Ascension and over-plot in
Fig. 5 (see the orange curves).
In addition to the observed Ṗ , the timing solution of
PSR J1748−3009 places a limit on its orbital period derivative Ṗb (see Table 3). The timing parameters indicate that
the pulsar is in a compact binary system with a period of
2.9-d and possibly in orbit with a white draft (the mass of
the companion is 0.08 − 0.20 M⊙ with a median of 0.1 M⊙ ).
Therefore, we can assume that the observed Ṗb includes contributions from both dynamics and the emission of gravitational waves (see Taylor & Weisberg 1989; Stairs et al. 2002;
Kramer et al. 2006). Thus, the observed Ṗb provides important information to estimate the intrinsic period derivative
of the pulsar independently. This approach has been used
previously in several studies (e.g., Matthews et al. 2016;
Freire et al. 2017; Prager et al. 2017). Similar to Eq. 1, we
can express the pulsar LOS acceleration in terms of observed
Ṗb as follows:

itational wave emission. Assuming General Relativity, the
expected (Ṗb )GR is −4.3 × 10−16 s/s (using Eq. 8.52 in
Lorimer & Kramer 2005, assuming a pulsar mass of 1.4 M⊙
and cos(i) = 0.5, resulting in a companion mass of 0.1 M⊙ ),
which is significantly smaller than the observed Ṗb limit of
−2.6(10) × 10−11 s/s. This indicates that the origin of the
observed Ṗb is most likely induced by the dynamical acceleration component of the pulsar along the LOS, similar to
the observed Ṗ measurement discussed earlier. Therefore,
we can simply assume that (a/c + aµ /c) ≈ Ṗb /Pb from Eq. 7
and then substitute that in to Eq. 1 to deduce Ṗint independently, and it is calculated to be (9.7 ± 8.0) × 10−19 s/s,
where the uncertainty is 2σ. Note that this measurement
is greater than the upper limit constrained above using the
Galactic mass model (see Table 7). The reason for this discrepancy could be that we only have a limit on Ṗb through
timing, so that the above estimated Ṗint from Eq. 7 is not
well constrained.
As given in Table 4, the timing model of
PSR J1801−3210 shows a positive, but extremely small
Ṗ . Given that PSR J1801−3210 is located towards the
GC (with an angular separation of 4.◦ 7 – see Table 5) and
has a large DM, it is probable that the measured Ṗ is
dominated by the acceleration of the pulsar due to the
Galactic potential. If Ṗobs < Ṗint , the contribution a/c
must be negative (see Eq. 1). We plot the acceleration
components given in Eq. 1 for this pulsar along its LOS in
Fig. 6. Following the same method as above, we can then
estimate the model-dependent upper limit on its intrinsic
Ṗ using Eq. 6, leading to a value of 3.5 × 10−20 s/s (see
Table 5). This limit is broadly consistent with the measured
Ṗ values of unaccelerated millisecond pulsars with a similar
period and we suspect that it is closer to the intrinsic Ṗ
value of the pulsar.
PSR J1746−2758 has a positive Ṗ measurement of
4.42(5) × 10−18 s/s, but this value is slightly smaller than
that of the majority of other known pulsars that have a

similar period (§ 4.6). Given that it is located towards the
GC, with an angular separation of 0.◦ 96, and also has a large
DM, it is possible that the observed Ṗ of PSR J1746−2752
is also influenced by its LOS acceleration. Therefore, we estimate the acceleration curves of this pulsar following the
same procedure as described above (see Fig. 6). Using Eq. 6,
we then estimate the upper limit on its intrinsic Ṗ to be
1.48 × 10−17 s/s, which is approximately a factor of 3 larger
than the measured value.
We finally plot the dynamically-derived modeldependent intrinsic Ṗ limits of all our pulsars with their
measured P values together with those of other known pulsars in Fig. 7. It is clear that the dynamically-derived Ṗ
limits of our pulsars are broadyly consistent with those of
other pulsars. Using these upper limits on Ṗ values, we estimate and present the lower limits on characteristic ages
and upper limits on surface magnetic fields in Table 3 and 4
(using Eq. 3.12 and 3.15 given in Lorimer & Kramer 2005).
5.4

Dynamical constraints on pulsar distances

Using the LOS acceleration values shown in Figures 5
and 6, we can simply estimate the intrinsic period derivatives Ṗint of PSRs J1746−2758, J1748−3009, J1753−2819,
J1757−2745, J1801−3210, and J1804−2858 as a function
of distance using Eq. 1 (see Fig. 8 and 9). By definition we
know that Ṗint is positive and thus, these curves can be used
to constrain the model-dependent distances to these pulsars.
Using the known pulsar population, we can impose possible
lower limits on their Ṗint values. To do that, we select known
pulsars within a 50 per cent window around the period of

a given pulsar in our sample, and then obtain the lowest
observed Ṗ in that population. This lowest Ṗ is used as the
minimum possible Ṗint for that given pulsar and it is plotted
in Fig. 8 and 9 with horizontal dashed lines. Assuming that
Ṗint should be greater than this minimum limit, we constrain
the distances to be (8.24 − 8.99), (8.24 − 9.08), (8.22 − 9.65),
(8.25 − 9.64), and (8.40 − 8.90) kpc for PSRs J1748−3009,
J1753−2819, J1757−2745, J1801−3210, and J1804−2858,
respectively (see Table 5). We notice that the lower limits of these distances are beyond the distances to the plane
which passes through the GC perpendicular to the line joining the Sun and the GC along their LOSs, placing all these
five pulsars on the far-side of the Galaxy. The distance to
PSR J1746−2758 is not well constrained (see Fig. 9), although, it is likely to be located at a distance of either
<7.5 kpc or >8.16 kpc. In all the above distance estimates,
we assume Sofue (2013) as our main Galactic model and the
peculiar velocity of the pulsar to be 100 km/s when calculating the Shklovskii contribution. If the velocity is larger
than this assumed value, then Ṗint decreases (i.e. the intrinsic curve shifts downward along y-axis) and thus, constrains the distance to a smaller range. Moreover, using the
timing-measured proper motion limits of PSRs J1757−2745,
J1801−3210, and J1804−2825, we estimate the Shklovskii
contribution and then derive Ṗint as before (see orange
curves in Fig. 8 and 9), leading to more conservative pulsar
distances of (8.27−9.40), (8.20−15.50), and (8.32−9.40) kpc,
respectively.
Note that, as we mentioned in § 5.2, the McMillan
(2017) model mainly focuses beyond the bulge regions and
thus, it cannot be used accurately to constrain the distances
to these pulsars. This can be seen in Fig. 8 and 9 as the
model-derived Ṗint values (grey solid curves) are potentially
smaller than the minimum possible Ṗint values (dashed black
horizontal lines).

5.5

The thermal free electron density model NE200113
(Cordes & Lazio 2002) is widely used to estimate the
distances to pulsars based on their measured DM obtained through timing. More recently, Yao et al. (2017)
(YMW1614 ) re-evaluated the electron density model by
using more recent independent pulsar distance observations. We compare our dynamically-estimated distances for
PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819, J1757−2745, J1801−3210,
and J1804−2825 given in § 5.4 with their DM-derived distances obtained from these electron density models. Note
that we do not use PSR J1746−2758 in this comparison since
its distance is not well constrained. We first use the YMW16
and NE2001 models separately to estimate the DM along the
LOS of these pulsars (see Fig. 10). Note that we take account
of a typical 20 per cent error on these DM values and indicate it with the shaded region in the figure. Based on the
measured DM values, we find that the DM-derived distances
obtained from the YMW16 model for PSRs J1748−3009,
J1757−2745, J1801−3210, and J1804−2825 are consistent

in the estimation of Ṗint /P . The blue dotted line represents the

the distance measured from the sky plane along the LOS. To get
the pulsar distance, the distance to the sky plane from the Sun
along the LOS (i.e. R⊙ cos(θ), where R⊙ = 8.2 kpc and θ is the
angular separation of the pulsar – see Table 5) should be added to
L (see Fig. 2). The orange lines present the derived Ṗint /P curve

proper motion limits of PSRs J1757−2745 and J1804−2858.

with our dynamics-derived distances within their uncertainties. For PSR J1753−2819, the DM-derived distance from
YMW16 is small compared to its dynamics-derived distance. This indicates that the electron density predicted
from YMW16 along the LOS of PSR J1753−2819 is overestimated, resulting in underestimated distance. As shown in
the figure, the DM-derived distances obtained from NE2001
model for all of these pulsars are underestimated compared
to their dynamics-estimated distances. By comparing the
two models, it is seen that in general the distances estimated
by the NE2001 model are underestimated (as reported before, see, e.g., Kramer et al. 2003) compared to those estimated by the YMW16 model at a given DM along the LOSs
of these pulsars.
We consider all known pulsars that are located within
an angular radius of 5◦ from the GC (i.e. θ < 5◦ ) and plot
their projected distances in the Galactic plane (see Fig. 11).
Note that, we use DM-derived distances for these pulsars
using the YMW16 model and assume a typical 20% uncertainty. We also plot our dynamically-derived distances for
PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819, J1757−2745, J1801−3210,
and J1804−2858 in the same figure. As can be seen, our distance estimates have much smaller uncertainties compared
to the DM-derived distances, and these five pulsars are located on the far-side of the Galaxy.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We report on the timing of recently discovered
PSR J1753−2819, a 18.6 ms pulsar in a 9.3-hr binary orbit.
We included this pulsar along with PSRs J1746−2758,
J1748−3009, J1757−2745, J1801−3210, and J1804−2858
using LT and PKS observations to understand their Ṗ
measurements. The improved timing baselines indicate
significant negative Ṗ measurements for PSRs J1748−3009,
J1753−2819, J1757−2745, and J1804−2858 (see Table 3

and 4). This is the first non-globular cluster pulsar sample
that has observed negative Ṗ measurements in their timing
solutions, and they all lie within a few degrees of the GC.
In addition, the timing of PSR J1801−3210 confirmed that
it has an extremely low positive Ṗ measurement, which
provides the lowest measured value for a pulsar to date.

Since pulsars are powered by the loss of rotational
kinetic energy, they spin-down gradually with a positive intrinsic Ṗ . Therefore, the negative Ṗ measurements of PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819, J1757−2745,
J1804−2858 and the extremely small Ṗ measurement of
PSR J1801−3210 are not intrinsic, but induced by dynamics. We modelled the observed Ṗ values of these pulsars as
being due to dynamical acceleration in the Galactic potential along their LOSs. The analysis constrained the modeldependent upper limits on the intrinsic Ṗ of these pulsars
and they are broadly consistent with those of known pulsars (see Fig. 7 and Table 7). Using these model-dependent
intrinsic Ṗ values, we then constrained possible pulsar
distances, indicating that PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819,
J1757−2745, J1801−3210, and J1804−2858 are located on
the far-side of the Galaxy (see Fig. 11 and Table 7). This is
the first time that dynamics have been used to measure the
distances to pulsars that are located in the far-side of the
Galaxy.
The timing solutions of three pulsars in our sample measured limits on their proper motions (see Table 4). Assuming
the Galactic model (Sofue 2013) is correct and Ṗint > 0, we
can determine the maximum possible total proper motion
for PSRs J1757−2745, J1801−3210, and J1804−2858 and
they are estimated to be 19.2, 12.6, and 13 mas/yr (using
Eq. 1). These maximum possible total proper motions are
consistent with our timing-measured limits given in Table 4.
If the high-significance timing-measured proper motions in
the future for these pulsars are greater than the above mentioned values, we can validate the Galactic model and also
include any required additional features in the model to explain the observed pulsar motions.
As shown in Fig. 10, our dynamics-derived distances
and the DM-derived distances from the YMW16 electron
density model for these pulsars are consistent with each
other in general within their uncertainties. However, the
NE2001 model-derived distances are inconsistent with the
MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

Dynamics of Galactic centre pulsars
dynamics-derived distance. This could be due to difficulties
in modelling the electron densities in the inner regions of
the Galaxy with high stellar densities and large gas and
dust contents towards the centre. Therefore, the independent distance measurements obtained to the pulsars in this
study can be used to further improve electron density models.
PSRs J1748−3009, J1753−2819, and J1801−3210 are
in binary systems and the timing results indicate that their
companions are likely to be white dwarfs. Using the measured Ṗb limit of PSR J1748−3009, we derived an independent limit on its intrinsic Ṗ . Following a similar method,
we will be able to measure Ṗb values of these binary pulsars in the future with more observations and thus, derive
their intrinsic Ṗ values independently with better accuracy
(see Smits et al. 2011). These estimates then can be used to
improve their distance measurements.
Most of the Galactic models assume that the mass distribution in the Galaxy is either axially or spherically symmetric for simplicity, in particular within the bulge region.
Having more pulsars in the Galactic centre region, we can
use their observations to derive dynamics independently to
study the Galactic potential, and then update and validate
Galactic models including clumpiness in the mass distribution. We can also obtain independent distances to these GC
pulsars in the future through parallax measurements using
interferometers such as VLBI and then use them in deriving the Galactic potential. The next generation telescopes,
such as the Square Kilometre Array, are useful with their
outstanding capabilities to discover more pulsars in the GC
region and to allow a comprehensive study to constrain the
Galactic potential in the central region using pulsar timing
in the future.

to the Galactic plane, respectively. Then the total velocity
of the Sun
~v⊙ = [U, V + vR (R⊙ ), W ],

(A1)

where vR (R⊙ ) is the velocity of the local standard of rest
for the Sun, or the circular Galactic rotational velocity
at the radius of Sun R⊙ . For our calculation, we assume
[U, V, W ] = [11.1, 12.24, 7.25] km/s (Schönrich et al. 2010)
and obtain the Galactic rotation vR from Galactic mass distribution models given in § 5.2. The main Galactic model
we use in this study (Sofue 2017) results in vR (R⊙ ) =
238 km/s, which is the value they adopted in their model
from Honma et al. (2012). Then the peculiar velocity, or
the 3-dimensional space velocity, of the pulsar is defined
as ~vp,pec = [Up , Vp , Wp ] in the same coordinate system as
before. The total velocity of the pulsar including its local
standard of rest,
~vpsr = [Up + vR (Rp ) sin θ′ , Vp + vR (Rp ) cos θ′ , Wp ],

(A2)

where vR (Rp ) is the Galactic rotational velocity of the pulsar
at its projected radial distance Rp on to the Galactic plane
and θ′ is the angle subtended at the GC between the position
of the Sun and the projected position of the pulsar on the
Galactic plane (see Fig. B.1 in Verbunt et al. 2017, for a
schematic diagram). The angle θ′ can be expressed as
tan(θ′ + l) =

R⊙ sin l
.
R⊙ cos l − d cos b

(A3)

Using the above coordinate system, the relative velocity
of the pulsar with respect to the Sun
~vpsr − ~v⊙ = [Up + vR (Rp ) sin θ′ − U,

Vp + vR (Rp ) cos θ′ − V − vR (R⊙ ), Wp − W ].
(A4)

To express the relative velocity in the Galactic coordinate
system (l, b), we write the unit vectors (l̂, b̂) in above coordinate system as
l̂ = [− sin l, cos l, 0]
b̂ = [− cos l sin b, − sin l sin b, cos b].

(A5)

We then write the relative velocity of the pulsar for its given
(l, b) with respect to the Sun in Galactic coordinates as
vl = l̂ · (~vpsr − ~v⊙ )

= − (Up + vR (Rp ) sin θ′ − U ) sin l

(A6)

′

+ (Vp + vR (Rp ) cos θ − V − vR (R⊙ )) cos l

and
vb = b̂ · (~vpsr − ~v⊙ )

= − (Up + vR (Rp ) sin θ′ − U ) cos l sin b

− (Vp + vR (Rp ) cos θ′ − V − vR (R⊙ )) sin l sin b

APPENDIX A: TRANSVERSE VELOCITY OF
THE PULSAR AND THE SHKLOVSKII
CONTRIBUTION
We denote the peculiar velocity of the Sun as ~v⊙ ,pec =
[U, V, W ], where the unit vectors of the components are in
the direction from the Sun towards the GC, in the direction
of the Galactic rotation, and in the direction perpendicular

respectively. We finally calculate
the transverse velocity of
p 2
the pulsar to be vT =
(vl + vb2 ). The derivation of the
above expressions are given in Verbunt et al. (2017) in detail.
In § 5, for a given 3-dimensional pulsar space velocity of |~vp,pec
p |, we randomly calculate [Up , Vp , Wp ] (where
|~vp,pec | = Up2 + Vp2 + Wp2 ), leading to a transverse velocity of vT using Eq. A6 and A7. We perform 1000 trials for
MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

Dynamics of Galactic centre pulsars
a given |~vp,pec | and then obtain the average vT , and then
calculate the Shklovskii effect aµ /c = vT2 /cd. We note that
vT is a function of Rp and thus, it varies along the LOS of
the pulsar for a given ~vp,pec , and then aµ /c. For instance,
this variation in aµ /c can be seen in Fig. 5.
