Abstract
Inertial particles in 2D driven by a Gaussian white noise forcing are considered. For two examples of
the forcing (compressible and incompressible) upper and lower bounds are found for the mean number of
caustics as a function of Stokes number. Efficiency of the bounds is verified by numerical methods.
Keywords: Inertial particles, Caustics, Lagrangian stochastic models

Introduction
In compressible fluid flows the density of Lagrangian particles finite at an initial moment can go to
infinity in finite time as a flow is evolving. Such density explosions are related to occurence of caustics in
the underlying velocity field. One of the most important such phenomena is motion of inertial particles in
turbulence ( a comprehensive review can be found in [1]).
In this work we address the mean frequency (intensity) of caustic occurence ν in the framework of a
stochastic flow modeling Lagrangian motion in a turbulent velocity field. The stochastic flow concept allows
one for describing joint statistics of several particles or even a particle continuum at any moment.
The main goal is to introduce two particular models in two dimensions, very simple but not trivial, for
which the dependence of ν on Stokes number s (the ratio of Lagrangian and Eulerian time scales, [2]) can
be analytically investigated to a certain extent. Namely, first, lower and upper bounds for ν(s) are provided
yielding an exact asymptotic as s → 0 and, second, ν(s) is accurately evaluated for a wide range of s by
solving a 1D parabolic equation numerically.
A general version of a stochastic flow addressed here has been introduced in [3] and assumes finite particle
velocities and a white noise type of accelerations. Thus, it is not a Kraicnan model of turbulence widely
used in physics of fluids [2]. More exactly, assume that the position r(t, a) of a particle at time t with the
initial position a and its velocity v(t, a) are described by the following Ito equations
dr = vdt, dv = −(v/τ )dt + dw(t, r),

r(0, a) = a, v(0, a) = u0 (a)

(1)

where u0 (x) is an initial (Eulerian) velocity field, w(t, r) is a random forcing with zero mean which is a
Brownian motion in time and a statistically homogeneous random field in space , i.e.
Ew(t1 , r1 )dw(t2 , r2 )T = min(t1 , t2 )B(r1 − r2 )
where B(r) is its space covariance matrix, all the vectors are two-dimensional, and finally τ is the Lagrangian
correlation time scale.
In particular, the motion of a single particle in the framework (1) is covered by a Langevin equation for
the velocity
dv = −(v/τ )dt + B(0)1/2 dw(t)
where w(t) is a standard Brownian motion in 2D, thereby the Lagrangian velocity of the particle is simply
a well known (two-dimensional) Ornstein-Uhlenback process and its position is an integrated OrnsteinUhlenback process.

In general the motion of any number n of the particles is described by a diffusion process in R2n for the
vector of positions/velocities (r1 , v1 , ..., rn , vn ) with a drift and diffusivity matrix expressed in terms of τ
and B, [3].
In this work we mostly address the Jacobian

which depends on the direction of a for anisotropic flows.
A consideration of two-particle motion suffices for studying both characteristics .
An important physical meaning of the Jacobian can be seen from the following. Let the initial position a
be a random variable independent of the flow with pdf π0 (a), then for the conditional pdf π(t, r) conditioned
on the flow is given by
π(t, r(t, a)) = π0 (r(t, a))/J(t, a)
Hence, if for some t0 the Jacobian takes zero value, the density becomes infinite at the point r(t0 , a) what
we will call an occurrence of a caustic at this point.
We show that for a certain class of forcings caustics arise with probability one, they form a stationary
process in time and sensible bounds for the mean number of caustics are given.
In Eulerian terms equations (1) cover Lagrangian motion in the Eulerian velocity field u(t, x) satisfying
the following equation
∂w
∂u
+ u · ∇u + u/τ =
,
u|t=0 = u0 (x)
(4)
∂t
∂t
By the method of characteristics one can find that for some short interval (0, t) the solution of this equation
exists and unique since at the initial moment J(0, a) = 1. However after some time the uniqueness is lost
(the Jacobian takes a zero value) due to a very weak dissipation modeled by the last term on the left hand
side (LHS). Thus, estimates of the mean of the first moment when J(t, a) hits zero would provide us with
an idea when (4) looses uniqueness. In terms of the non-linear wave theory, one can treat that as the first
moment of wave breaking.
Some of our results can be predicted by simply procceding to dimensionless variables in (4). Let U and
L be some typical velocity and length scales respectively. Changing u, w, x, t to u/U, w/U, x/L, t/τ one gets
from (4)
∂u
∂w
+ su · ∇u + u =
∂t
∂t
where the dimensionless parameter
Uτ
s=
(5)
L
is called Stokes number.
Thus, if s → 0 then the underlying Eulerian velocity field satisfies a linear equation and hence the
intensity of caustics should tend to zero. In the opposite case s → ∞ the non-linear term dominates and
one may expect that the number of caustics per time grows indefinitely.
The paper is organized as follows. A similar one-dimensional problem is exactly solved in Section 1. The
solution is essentially used in investigating 2D phenomena. A deterministic case (w = 0) is briefly discussed
in Section 2. In Section 3 we derive a system of equations containing J in the general case of an arbitrary
homogeneous forcing. For particular forms of the forcing rigorous estimates for the mean number of caustics
ν(s) are found in Section 4. Also ν(s) is computed by solving a simple 1D parabolic equation. The case
of an isotropic forcing (unsolved yet) is mentioned in Section 5. Conclusions are gathered in Section 6 and
some details are brought to Appendix.

1. One-dimensional case
A part of results from this section is well known from physical literature, [1]. We formulate them in
rigorous form and give more details.
Consider
dx = udt, du = −(u/τ )dt + dw(t, x), x(0) = a, u(0) = u0 (a)
(6)
with Ew(t, x) = 0 and
Ew(t1 , x1 )dw(t2 , x2 ) = min(t1 , t2 ))b(x1 − x2 )
For
J(t, a) =

∂x
∂a

one can get by direct differentiation (6) in a
dJ = J1 dt, dJ1 = −(J1 /τ )dt + Jdw̃(t)
where

∂u
,
E w̃(t) = 0, E w̃(t)2 = −b′′ (0)t
∂a
By setting p = τ J1 /J, introducing dimensionless time t = t/τ , and using Ito formula obtain
√
dp = (−p − p2 )dt + 2sdw
J1 (t, a) =

(7)

where w is a standard Wiener process and
p
−b′′ (0)τ 3

(8)
p
. Worth noting that if the velocity and length scales of the flow are chosen as U = b(0)τ and L =
p
−b(0)/b′′ (0) respectively, then (8) coincides with the earlier introduced Stokes number (5).
Assume that zeros of J(t) are prime that is typical for stationary processes, then they can be identified
with moments of explosion of p(t).
Proposition 1.
Process p is explosive(e.g. [4]), more exactly
s=

lim p(t) = −∞,

t→S−0

where the explosion time S is finite
P (S < ∞) = 1
and its expectation can be explicitly computed
√
E(S) = 2π 2 zM (z)2 , z = s−4/3 /4
where
M (z) =

p
Ai(z)2 + Bi(z)2 ,

Ai(z), Bi(z) are the Airy functions and M (z) their modulus.

Explosiveness of p(t) follows from the Feller’s criteria, [4].
To prove (9) introduce µ(x) as the mean time to explosion under condition p(0) = x, then solve
Lµ(x) = −1,

µ(−∞) = 0

and set
E(S) = µ(∞).

(9)

where

∂2
∂

is the generator of (7). Details of computations can be found in [5].
For the purpose of studying 2D models the knowledge of the mean explosion time is not enough. Introduce
L = (−x − x2 )

F̄ (t) = P (S > t)
and let u(t, x) be the same probability under condition p(0) = x, then
F̄ (t) = u(t, ∞)
In [6] it is shown that u(t, x) satisfies the initial value problem
∂u(t, x)
= Lx u(t, x), u(0, x) = 1
∂t

(10)

To ensure uniqueness of solution of (10) we add the natural boundary conditions assuming that the limit
u(t, ∞) exists similarly to m(∞).
u(t, −∞) = 0, ux (t, ∞) = 0
A simplest Euler scheme was used for solving (10) numerically. Some details and validation of the choice
of the scheme parameters are given in Appendix. Notice that our goal is not to evaluate and minimize the
error of the numerical computations, but rather to illustrate that (10) can be solved quite accurately and
efficiently with very simple tools.
Graphs of F̄ (t) for few values of s are shown in Fig.1

After explosion process p(t) can be continued by starting over, i.e. by solving same eq. (7) with the
initial condition
lim p(t) = ∞
t→S+0

The positive sign follows from relation J1 = dJ/dt and the fact that zeros of J(t) are prime. Thus p(t) takes
different signs on different sides of a zero of J(t).

Proposition 2.
The ergodic mean of p is given by
M ′ (z)
p̄ = −1 + √
2 zM (z)

(11)

The statement is proven in Appendix and here we just make some comments. Notice that the density of
the stationary distribution π(p) of p(t) does exist and is given by

where C is a normalized constant.
One can find the following asymptotic
π(p) ∼ |p|−2 ,

p → ∞.

Thus, the integral for the invariant mean
Ep =

is formally divergent, however if the integral is meant as a Cauchy principal value then it coincides with the
RHS of (11).
For bounded functions of p the ergodicity holds true with a conventional interpretation of the integral
over the invariant density.

2. Deterministic 2D Case
Let us assume w = 0 in (1) and proceed to dimensionless variables as described in Introduction before
eq. (5). As a result the expression for the Jacobian (2) is found in the explicit form
J(t) = P s2 1 − e−t
where s is Stokes number defined in (5)
P =

and (a, b), / / (u0 , v0 ) are the initial position and velocity respectively related by u0 = u0 (a, b), v0 = v0 (a, b).
Let
\
G = {(P, Q)| Q2 > 4P } {(P, Q)| P < 0 or Q < 0}

and S be the first time when J(S) = 0. Easy to find that

In particular if Q = 0 and P < 0 do not depend on (a, b) at all, then G = R2 and S , defined for all s > 0,
does not depend on the initial point as well. Thus, the equation
∂u
+ su · ∇u + u = 0,
∂t

u(0, x) = u0 (x)

(13)

looses uniqueness exactly at moment t = S. If one defines u(t, x) after t > S as a solution of (13) with the
initial condition
u(S+, x) = u0 (x)
then ν = 1/S could be interpreted as the intensity of caustics in time. In Figure 2 we show few curves ν(s)
for different s0 in order to compare them visually with a stochastic case addressed in the next sections.

If S depends on the initial point, then its interpretation in terms of Eulerian set up (13) is not that
simple and will not be discussed here.

3. System of Equations for Jacobian in general 2D Case
Now we return to the stochastic model (1). In few works it was pointed out that there is a closed equation
for the matrix



An analysis of that equation led to some general important conclusions, but it is of little help for our purposes
because in general it cannot be reduced to efficiently handled scalar equations.
Let us first rewrite (1) in the coordinate wise form with r = (x, y), a = (a, b)
du = −(u/τ )dt + dw(1) (t, x, y),
x(0) = a, y(0) = b,

dv = −(v/τ )dt + dw(2) (t, x, y),

dx = udt,

dy = vdt
(14)

u(0) = u0 (a, b), v(0) = v0 (a, b)

where
Edw(i) (t, 0, 0)dw(j) (t, x, y) = bij (x, y)dt
and bij are entries of B The goal is to investigate time behavior of the Jacobian
J(t) ≡

∂x ∂y ∂x ∂y
−
∂a ∂b
∂b ∂a

It is not possible to obtain a closed equation for J(t), but it can be included in a system of four equation as
it is shown in Appendix. Namely, for dimensionless time t = t/τ denoted by the same letter, Jacobian can
be represented as

s is Stokes number defined similarly to (8) and an exact expression for it is given in Appendix.
To define processes ηi (t) we nondimensionalize w(i) (t) and set
η1 = wy(2) − wx(1) , η2 = wy(2) + wx(1) , η3 = wx(2) − wy1 , η4 = wx(2) + wy(1) ,

4. Two special cases
Under certain conditions imposed on the forcing in (14) the first moment S of J(t) to hit zero turns out
to be the minimum from the first explosion moments for two independent 1D processes described by (7).

Eη1 η2 = 0 and hence
w1 = (η1 + η2 )/2, w2 = (η1 − η2 )/2

By adding and subtracting first two equations in (15) we get two separated equations
dp = (−p − p2 )dt + sdw1 , dq = (−q − q 2 )dt + sdw2

(20)

for independent identically distributed processes p(t) and q(t)
Model 2
In this model we assume
w(1) (t, x, y) = U (t, x + y) + V (t, x − y), w(2) (t, x, y) = −U (t, x + y) + V (t, x − y)
with independent U and V such that

2

E (U ′ ) = E (V ′ )

(21)

(22)

From (16, 17, 21, 22) it follows that
η2 = 0, η4 = 0
and
w1 = (η1 + η3 )/2, w2 = (η1 − η3 )/2

are independent identically distributed Wiener processes since η1 = −2(U ′ + V ′ ) and η3 = −2(U ′ − V ′ )
Thus m2 = m4 ≡ 0 and introducing
p=

arrive at the same equations (20).

Let S1 and S2 be the first explosion moments for p(t) and q(t) respectively, then
S = min(S1 , S2 )
Certainly the knowledge of ESi is not enough to find E(S), but the latter can be expressed in terms of
F̄ (t) = P (S1 > t) as

Manipulating with this formula it is not difficult to present an example where the expected value of the
minimum of two independent identically distributed random variables X, Y is finite while the expectation
of each variable is infinite due to heavy tails of X, Y distribution. So, theoretically speaking ESi and E(S)
may differ in an order. Fortunately it is not the case here since the tail of distribution of S1 is exponential
and can be evaluated [5].

while for large s the corresponding asymptotics differ just by a constant
0.4s2/3 < ν(s) < 1.25s2/3
Approximation (25) is quite speculative and indeed it greatly overestimates ν(s). It can be seen by comparing
the bounds with exact curve ν(s) obtained from solving the corresponding PDE for F̄ (t) (Section 1). The
upper and lower bounds for ν(s) are shown in Figure 4 as well as its numerical version.
Finally, notice that LE in Model 1 is given by the same expression (11) as in 1D case. Indeed, in this case
each component of the separation process ∆r = r(t, a) − r(t, 0) is the separation process for one dimensional
flow (6). Hence |∆r| ≈ |a exp (λt) for small |a| and large t, where λ is LE for (6). Then our claim follows
from definition (3).
In Model 2 LE cannot be found by such simple tools because the equations for x and y components are
not split.

(−m1 m4 − m4 )dt + sN dw4 ,

here wj , j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are independent standard Wiener processes.
No essential progress is made in analyzing this system yet because none of variables can be eliminated.
The only reason for presenting it here is a great importance of the isotropic case for applications.

6. Conclusion and Discussion
While one dimensional stochastic models for inertial particles have been comprehensively studied, [1,8]
there was a lack of 2D examples with a significant analytical advances. Here we suggested two such examples,
where the mean time to explosion in the particle density , µ(s), can be analytically estimated for the full
range of Stokes number s and can be accurately evaluated by solving an initial/boundary problem for a
one dimensional parabolic equation. The reported advance in the proposed models is due to reduction in
the number of unknowns in the system (15) from four to two. Alas, for the most interesting isotropic case
such a reduction is not possible, but a hope for finding asymptotics of ν(s) still remain. For both models
the reciprocal ν(s) = 1/µ(s), interpreted as the intensity of caustics, increases monotonically from zero to
infinity that is not a surprise at all.
Regarding to a Riemann type equation for the underlying velocity field (4), µ(s) can be viewed as a time
scale on which a solution remains unique. It should be recognized that the interpretation of µ and ν in terms
of the Eulerian velocity field is not clear enough except the deterministic case with the initial velocity field
u0 (x) for which |∂u0 ∂x/| and ∇ · u0 do not depend on x at all.

Appendix
A1. Proof of Proposition 2
The proof is based on the following statement
Lemma . If there exist real m and smooth bounded function V (x) such that
V (∞) = V (−∞) = 0

(A1)

LV (x) = x − m,

(A2)

and
then with probability one
p̄ = m
Proof . From (A2) and Ito formula it follows that V (p(t)) satisfies
dV = (p − m)dt + sV ′ dw.
By integrating both sides we get

The second term on the right hand side goes to zero as T → ∞ due to the large numbers law. The difference
on the left hand side (LHS) of (A4) also converges to zero because of the boundness of V and condition
(A1). Lemma is proven.

Notice importance of (A1). If V (∞) 6= V (−∞) then the jumps of V at explosion moments can
accumulate leading to a non-zero limit of LHS.
Now we directly construct such a function V (x) and determine m.
First, we take a bounded solution of (A2)

The integral for M is meant as Cauchy principal value. That allows for changing the order of integration

To complete the proof one should account for, [5],
g(x) = π −1 M (x)2 .
This relation also can be derived from the fact that the both sides satisfy the same differential equation and
same initial conditions, [9].
Finally, notice that the expression for m after changing the order of integration in (A4) turns to the mean
of p(t) with respect to the invariant measure π(p) given in (12)
Proposition 2 is proven. Proposition 3 can be proven by the same arguments.
A2. Details of the computational algorithm for solving (10)
Let h and ∆t be space and time respectively, X > 0 a big enough number, xi = −X + (i − 1)h, n =
(n − 1)∆t the corresponding space/time grid, i = 1, ..., M, n = 1, ..., N where h = 2X/M, ∆t = t/N . Set
bi = ∆t(xi + x2i + s2 /h), a = ∆ts2 /h. Then a standard Eulerian scheme for (23) is written as
ui+1 (n) = ui (n) + hyi (n)
(A5)
ui+1 (n + 1) − ui+1 (n) = ayi+1 (n) − bi yi (n)
Notice that (A5) is well posed because ui (1) = 1, i = 1, ..., M, u1 (n) = 0, yM (n) = 0, n = 1, ..., N
The choice of parameters X, h, ∆t was dictated by standard conditions on ratio ∆t/h and constraints

where µ(s) = E(S) is the exact value of the expectation of S found from (9). In particular µ(1/ 2 =8.7735

A3. Derivation of (15)
For the purpose of nondimensionalizing let us redenote the forcing on RHS of (14) by capital letters
W (i) (t, x, y), i = 1, 2. Then by differentiating (14) in a and b we get
dua = −(ua /τ )dt + xa dξ1 + ya dξ2 ,
dub = −(ub /τ )dt + xb dξ1 + yb dξ2 ,

dva = −(va /τ )dt + xa dξ1 + ya dξ4 ,

dxa = ua dt,

dya = va dt

dvb = −(vb /τ )dt + xb dξ1 + yb dξ4 ,

dxb = ua dt,

dyb = vb dt

where
ξ1 = ∂W (1) /∂x,

ξ2 = ∂W (1) /∂y,

To proceed to dimensionless variables assume
W (i) (t, x, y) = στ 1/2 w(i) (t/τ, x/L, y/L), i = 1, 2
where w(i) are dimensionless Wiener processes, thereby in dimensionless variables
Edw(i) (t, 0, 0)dw(j) (t, x, y) = bij (x, y)dt
with
B ij (x, y) = σ 2 bij (x/L, y/L)

h = στ 1/2

We do not need a stochastic equation for J5 since it can be found from the following equation
I22 − I12 − I42 + I32 = −4JJ5 ,

(A6)

which follows from
J1 J2 + JJ5 = J3 J4 .
We can reduce the number of freedom degrees by introducing mk = Ik /J,
eliminated by means of (A6). The result is system (15)

k = 1, ..., 5 where m5 is
