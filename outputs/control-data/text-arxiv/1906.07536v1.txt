Higgs boson production in partonic and electromagnetic (photon-photon) interactions of lightand heavy-ions (A-A) at the LHC and future colliders is summarized. Parton-induced cross
sections –including gluon-gluon, vector-boson fusion, and associated W, Z, t processes– are
computed at NNLO with mcfm 8.0 using nuclear parton distribution functions. Photonphoton cross sections are computed with madgraph 5.0 for ultraperipheral A-A interactions
√
with both ions surviving the collision. In the center-of-mass energy range sNN ≈ 5–100 TeV,
the ratio of electromagnetic-to-partonic Higgs cross sections is Re.m./parton ≈ 10−5 –10−4 . At
FCC energies, this ratio is 10–100 times larger in A-A than in p-p thanks to the strong
nuclear coherent γ fluxes. The feasibility of Higgs boson measurements at LHC, HE-LHC,
and FCC, in the most-favourable H → γγ, bb decay channels in partonic and e.m. interactions
respectively, is determined taking into account standard acceptance and efficiency losses, plus
selection criteria to minimize the respective continuum backgrounds. Whereas 3σ evidence
for partonic and e.m. Higgs production requires about ×35 and ×200 (×7 and ×30) larger
integrated luminosities than those expected for a nominal 1-month run at the LHC (HE-LHC),
a 5σ observation of both production modes is warranted in just one FCC month.

Introduction

The Higgs boson remains unobserved in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC due to the lower nucleon√
nucleon c.m. energies ( sNN ), as well as integrated luminosities (Lint ), in A-A compared to p-p
collisions. Three planned or proposed CERN future hadron colliders: the high-luminosity LHC
(HL-LHC) 1 , high-energy LHC (HE-LHC) 1,2 , and Future Circular Collider (FCC) 3 , will noticeably increase the available c.m. energies and Lint values, thereby making the observation of the
scalar boson potentially feasible in nuclear collisions. The motivations for such a measurement
are twofold. First, when produced in standard parton-induced processes, the H boson can be
used to probe the properties of the quark-gluon plasma produced in A-A collisions 4 (although
this possibility has been challenged in Ref. 5 ). Secondly, the Higgs boson can also be exclusively
γγ
produced via A-A−→(A)H(A) in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) where the ions
survive their electromagnetic (e.m.) interaction. This latter unique production mode exploits
the huge e.m. fields generated by the collective action of Z individual proton charges, leading
to photon-photon cross sections enhanced by up to factors Z 4 ≈ 5 · 107 , for Pb-Pb, compared to
proton or e± beams 6 . The UPC production provides an independent measurement of the H-γ
coupling not based on Higgs decays but on s-channel production, and of the total Higgs width by
7
combining it with the LHC diphoton decay branching ratio, via Γtot
H = Γ(H → γγ)/B(H → γγ) .
The parton-initiated cross sections –including gluon-gluon, vector-boson fusion, and associated W, Z, t processes– have been studied for A-A collisions at the LHC and FCC in Ref. 8 ,
including their expected yields after analysis cuts in the cleanest H → γγ decay. The Higgs UPCproduction was first considered 30 years ago 9 , and detailed studies of the dominant H → bb
decay channel, including realistic acceptance and efficiencies for signal and γγ → bb continuum
background presented in Refs. 10 for LHC, HE-LHC, and FCC. This work here extends previous
studies by including also light-ion collisions, and compares the results of both production modes.

Higgs boson in partonic A-A collisions

√
The Higgs cross sections in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions over sNN ≈ 3–100 TeV have been
computed at NNLO accuracy in Ref. 8 with mcfm (v.8.0) 11 , using the CT10 proton PDFs 12
and EPS09 nuclear PDFs (nPDFs, including its 30 eigenvalues sets) 13 , and fixing the default
renormalization and factorization scales at µR = µF = mH /2. The PDF uncertainties, obtained
adding in quadrature the CT10 and EPS09 uncertainties, are ∼10%. The computed nucleonnucleon cross sections are scaled by the mass number A or A2 to obtain the corresponding p-A or
A-A cross sections respectively, including those for future runs with lighter-ions (Xe-Xe, Kr-Kr,
Ar-Ar, and O-O), not considered so far. Compared to the corresponding p-p results at a given
c.m. energy, antishadowing nPDF modifications slightly enhance (deplete) the nucleon-nucleon
yields by ∼3% at the LHC (FCC). The O (5 − 10%) theoretical µR,F scale uncertainties cancel
out in the ratios of (p-Pb,Pb-Pb)/(p-p) cross sections at the same colliding energy. The collision
energy dependence of the parton-induced Higgs cross sections for all colliding systems is shown
Fig. 1 (left, solid curves). The cross sections increase by about a factor of ×4 and ×20 between
LHC (σPbPb→H+X ≈ 500 nb), and HE-LHC (∼2 µb) and FCC (∼11.5 µb) respectively.
A first Higgs measurement in nuclear collisions will use the clean diphoton and 4-lepton finalstate channels as done in p-p 14 , with very low branching ratios but small and/or controllable
backgrounds. After branching ratios (B = 0.23% for γγ, 0.012% for 4 `), and taking into account
typical ATLAS/CMS analysis cutsa , which result in ∼50% acceptance and efficiency signal losses,
one expects about 10, 50, and 1 500 Higgs bosons per month in Pb-Pb at the LHC (5.5 TeV),
HE-LHC (10.6 TeV), and FCC (39 TeV) with Lint = 10, 10, and 110 nb−1 respectively, on top of
the corresponding γγ and 4` non-resonant backgrounds. In the γγ case, the backgrounds include
the irreducible QCD diphoton continuum plus 30% of events coming from misidentified γ-jet
and jet-jet processes. For the nominal HL-LHC and HE-LHC luminosities,
the significances of
√
the diphoton signal (S) over the background (B), computed via S/ B at the Higgs peak, are
0.5 and 1.2σ, and thus one would need a factor of ×35 and ×7 larger integrated luminosities
to reach 3σ evidence at both machines. A straightforward way to gain a factor of ∼10 in Lint
would be to run one full-year, instead of one heavy-ion month, but even in this case evidence at
the HL-LHC would require an extra ×3 increase in the instantaneous luminosity. The situation
is much more favourable at HE-LHC and FCC. Figure 2 shows the expected diphoton invariant
mass distributions for Pb-Pb at HE-LHC (×7 the nominal 1-month luminosity, left) and FCC
(nominal luminosity, right). The significances of the H(γγ) peaks are 3σ and 5.5σ respectively.

Higgs boson in electromagnetic A-A collisions

The madgraph 5 (v.2.6.5) Monte Carlo event generator 15 is employed to compute the UPC
cross sections for Higgs boson and diquark continuum (bb, as well as misidentified cc and lightquark qq, pairs) 10 , by convolving the Weizsäcker-Williams equivalent γ fluxes of the ions (as a
function of impact parameter b) 16 and/or protons 17 with the elementary γγ → H cross section
(with H-γ coupling parametrized in the Higgs effective field theory). We exclude nuclear overlap
by imposing b1 > RA1 and b2 > RA2 for each γ flux (where RA is the radius of nucleus A), and
applying a correcting factor 18 on the final cross section that depends on the ratio of Higgs mass
√
over sγγ . The computed exclusive γγ → Higgs cross sections are shown in Fig. 1 (left, dashed
√
curves) as a function of sNN for all colliding systems. The larger the charge of the ions, the
larger the UPC cross sections. In the Pb-Pb case, the Higgs cross sections increase by about
a factor of ×10 and ×100 between LHC (σγγ→ H ≈ 15 pb), and HE-LHC (∼150 pb) and FCC
√
(∼1.8 nb) respectively. Note that, below sNN ≈ 5 TeV, the e.m. production cross section in
Pb-Pb is larger than the partonic one in p-p collisions. The ratio of e.m.-to-partonic Higgs cross
sections is shown in Fig. 1 (right). For A-A collisions, one finds Re.m./parton ≈ 10−5 –10−4 due to
the strong nuclear coherent γ fluxes. This ratio in practice amounts to Re.m./parton ≈ 0.01–0.03
when one further accounts for the B = 0.27%, 56% of the most-favourable H → γγ, bb decay
channels for a measurement in partonic and e.m. interactions respectively. As a function of c.m.
energy, Re.m./parton decreases for p-p (as the partonic cross sections increase faster than the e.m.
ones) but increases for A-A (as the energy of the coherent γ fluxes rise) up to a point where it
levels off and starts to drop. At FCC energies, the ratio is 10–100 larger in A-A than in p-p.
The feasibility of measuring e.m. exclusive Higgs production is studied in its dominant H → bb
decay. Taking into account the expected beam luminosities, the most competitive system to try
a measurement is Ar-Ar (Kr-Kr) at the HL-LHC (HE-LHC). At the FCC, the combination of
×100 larger cross sections and ×10 larger Lint yield ∼200 Higgs produced per month (∼110 in
the bb channel). The following acceptance and reconstruction performances are assumed: jet
reconstruction over |η| < 2 (5 for FCC), 7% b-jet energy resolution (resulting in ∼6 GeV dijet
mass resolution at the Higgs peak), 70% b-jet tagging efficiency, and 5% (1.5%) b-jet mistagging
probability for a c (q) quark. These selection criteria lead to a ∼50% signal loss, and a total
reduction of the misidentified cc and qq non-resonant backgrounds by factors of ∼400 and ∼4500
respectively. The remaining irreducible bb continuum is further suppressed through kinematical
cuts on the jet pjet
T ≈ 55–67 GeV, invariant dijet mass mbb ≈ 116–134 GeV, and dijet angular
distribution | cos θj1 j2 | < 0.5. The final signal significance is derived from the number of counts
around the Gaussian Higgs peak over the dijet continuum. Evidence for UPC Higgs at the
HL-LHC
requires
√
√ ×200 times larger-than-nominal Lint values in Ar-Ar(6.3 TeV), so as to reach
S/ B ≈ 10/ 12 ≈ 3 (Fig. 3, left). The same analysis for Kr-Kr(12.5 TeV) at the HE-LHC

16

indicates that ×30 larger Lint values are needed than currently designed. On the other hand,
√
Pb-Pb collisions at sNN = 39 GeV with the FCC nominal Lint = 110 nb−1 per month, yield
∼20 signal counts over about the same number for the sum of backgrounds. Reaching a 5σ
statistical significance would just require to combine the measurements of the first run from two
different experiments or accumulating two 1-month runs in a single one (Fig. 3, right).

Conclusions

The expected Higgs production cross sections and yields from parton-induced and exclusive
photon-photon processes in heavy- and light-ion collisions have been studied in the diphoton
and bb final states respectively at the HL-LHC, HE-LHC, and FCC. Evidence for the scalar
boson, over the expected continuum backgrounds, seems out of reach at the HL-LHC with the
currently expected integrated luminosities, but can be possible in the partonic mode at HE-LHC.
Full observation in both production modes requires a future hadron collider such as the FCC.
