ON EXPANDER CAYLEY GRAPHS FROM GALOIS RINGS
SHOHEI SATAKE

Abstract. In this paper, we study new Cayley graphs over the additive group of Galois rings. First we prove that they are expander
graphs by using a Weil-Carlitz-Uchiyama type estimation of character
sums for Galois rings. We also show that Cayley graphs from Galois
rings of characteristic 4 form a new infinite family of Ramanujan graphs
by an elementary eigenvalue estimation. Moreover some other spectral
properties of our graphs are also discussed.

1. Introduction
For a group Γ and a subset S ⊂ Γ \ {0} such that S = −S, the Cayley
graph Cay(Γ, S) over Γ defined by S is the graph on the vertex set Γ such
that two vertices x and y are adjacent if x − y ∈ S. Here we denote the
operation of Γ additively and −S is the set of inverses of elements in S. In
this paper we deal with Cayley graphs over the additive group of certain
finite commutative rings called Galois rings; see Section 2.
First, we show that they are expander graphs whose degrees are small
powers of the number of vertices. Especially Cayley graphs constructed from
Galois rings of characteristic 4 form a new infinite family of Ramanujan
graphs. To explain expander graphs and Ramanujan graphs, we need to
explain the adjacency matrix of graphs. The adjacency matrix of a graph
G is the 0-1 matrix whose rows and columns are indexed by its vertices
such that the (u, v)-entry is 1 if and only if u and v are adjacent. For
simplicity, let eigenvalues of G denote eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix
of G. If G is a d-regular graph, by the Perron-Frobenius theorem (e.g.
[11, Chapter 31]), the largest eigenvalue is d and all eigenvalues of G are
in the interval [−d, d]. And −d is an eigenvalue of G if and only if G is
bipartite. Now we are ready to explain expander graphs. A d-regular graph
G is called an expander graph if its second largest eigenvalue is smaller than
the largest eigenvalue d (see e.g. [7]). Let λ(G) be the largest absolute
value of eigenvalues of G other than ±d.
√ Then a d-regular graph G is
called a Ramanujan graph if λ(G) ≤ 2 d − 1 (see [14]). By the AlonBoppana bound (see e.g. [14]), Ramanujan graphs can be regarded as the

best possible expander graphs. Expander graphs have wide applications (for
details, see e.g. [7]) and explicit constructions of expander graphs are very
important and interesting from the view of mathematics and applications.
In these three decades, many constructions are found in various areas of
mathematics. Especially, as pointed out by Chee-Ling [4], expander graphs
with symmetry are important in applications. So constructions based on
Cayley graphs are preferable since Cayley graphs have vertex-transitivity.
For constructions based on Cayley graphs, see e.g. [12].
We note that our expander Cayley graphs have the similar sparseness to
those of the Chung’s graphs [5] and some generalized graphs in [8], [13], [15]
and [16]. And it is worth noting that our construction of Ramanujan graphs
from Galois rings of characteristic 4 uses only elementary discussions and
fundamental facts of Galois rings. We remark that known constructions of
Ramanujan graphs are usually based on deep results or methods in number
theory and related algebraic areas.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the
definition of Galois rings and some known basic facts. Section 3, 4 and 5
are the main part of this paper. In Section 3, we construct Cayley graphs
from Galois rings and show that they are expander graphs by a Weil-CarlitzUchiyama type estimation for Galois rings ([9]). We also discuss the girth
for some cases. In Section 4, we focus on Cayley graphs from Galois rings of
characteristic 4 and show that they are Ramanujan graphs by an elementary
character sum estimation based on [3]. In Section 5, we also prove some other
interesting spectral property of our Ramanujan graphs in Section 4. At last,
in Section 6, we give a concluding remark.
2. Galois rings
For details of Galois rings, see the textbook [17, Chapter 14]. We will
also refer some facts denoted in [3, Section III, IV] and [6, Section III].
Let p be a prime and e be a positive integer. Let Zpe be the residue ring
Z/pe Z and Zpe [x] the polynomial ring over Zpe . Define ρ : Zpe → Zp as the
reduction map. For a polynomial f (x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + ak xk ∈ Zpe [x],
let ρ(f (x)) := ρ(a0 ) + ρ(a1 )x + · · · + ρ(ak )xk ∈ Zp [x]. Then f (x) ∈ Zpe [x]
is called monic basic irreducible if ρ(f (x)) ∈ Zp [x] is a monic irreducible
polynomial. For each r ≥ 1, the Galois ring of characteristic pe and order
per is defined as follows.
Definition 2.1. Let f (x) ∈ Zpe [x] be a monic basic irreducible polynomial
of degree r. Then the Galois ring GR(pe , per ) of characteristic pe and order
per is defined as follows:
GR(pe , per ) := Zpe [x]/(f (x))
Here (f (x)) is the principle ideal of Zpe [x] generated by f (x) and order and
characteristic are defined in the same manner as the case of finite fields.

Let GR+ (pe , per ) and GR∗ (pe , per ) be the additive and multiplicative
group of GR(pe , per ), respectively. The group structures of GR+ (pe , per ) and
GR∗ (pe , per ) were completely determined [17, Section 14.1, 14.4]. GR(pe , per )
is a free Zpe -module of rank r. And GR∗ (pe , per ) contains the cyclic group,
say G1 , of order pr − 1. Let ξ be a generator of G1 . Then the following
theorem is known.
Theorem 2.2 (Theorem 14.8 in [17]). For the Galois ring GR(pe , per ), the
following statements hold.
(1) Each element of GR(pe , per ) can be uniquely expressed by the form
a0 + a1 ξ + · · · + ar−1 ξ r−1 where a0 , a1 , . . . , ar−1 ∈ Zpe .
(2) Each element of GR(pe , per ) can be uniquely expressed by the form
b0 + b1 p + · · · + be−1 pe−1 where b0 , b1 , . . . , be−1 ∈ G1 ∪ {0}. Moreover,
b0 + b1 p + · · · + be−1 pe−1 is invertible if and only if b0 6= 0.

We can also define the trace function from GR(pe , per ) to Zpe . Let
φ : GR(pe , per ) → GR(pe , per ) be the map such that a0 +a1 ξ +· · ·+ar−1 ξ r−1
is mapped to a0 + a1 ξ p + · · · + ar−1 ξ p(r−1) . The map φ is actually a ring
automorphism of GR(pe , per ) and it is called the generalized Frobenius automorphism. Then the trace function T from GR+ (pe , per ) to Zpe is defined
by T (x) = x + φ(x) + · · · + φr−1 (x) for each x ∈ GR(pe , per ). Actually T is
a surjective linear map.
Let µ : GR(pe , per ) → GR(pe , per )/pGR(pe , per ) be the natural projection
map which is a ring homomorphism. Since pGR(pe , per ) is the unique maximal ideal of GR(pe , per ), the residue ring GR(pe , per )/pGR(pe , per ) is a finite
field isomorphic to Fpr . And θ := µ(ξ) is a primitive element of Fpr .
3. Cayley graphs from Galois rings
In this section, we define the following Cayley graph over GR+ (pe , per ).
Definition 3.1. Let e, r ≥ 2. For the prime p = 2, we define the Cayley
graph H2e ,2er := Cay(GR+ (2e , 2er ), G1 ∪ −G1 ). And for odd primes p ≥ 3,
we also define the Cayley graph Hpe ,per := Cay(GR+ (pe , per ), G1 ).
Note that for odd primes p, Hpe ,per is well-defined since G1 = −G1 . In
r
r
r
fact, since p is odd and ξ p −1 = 1, we see that (ξ (p −1)/2 −1)(ξ (p −1)/2 +1) = 1
r
r
and thus −1 = ξ (p −1)/2 because ξ (p −1)/2 − 1 is invertible by the following
lemma.
Lemma 3.2. Let p be a prime and e ≥ 2 an integer. Then for each 0 ≤ i 6=
j ≤ pr − 2, ξ i − ξ j is invertible.

Proof. It suffices to prove that 1 − ξ i is invertible for every 1 ≤ i ≤ pr − 2.
Suppose that 1 − ξ i ∈ pGR(pe , per ) for some 1 ≤ i ≤ pr − 2. Then θ i = 1,
which contradicts the fact that θ is a primitive element of Fpr .

From Definition 3, we can easily get the following proposition.

4

SHOHEI SATAKE

Proposition 3.3.
(1) H2e ,2er is a (2r+1 − 2)-regular graph with 2er vertices.
(2) Hpe ,per is a (pr − 1)-regular graph with per vertices.
Proof. Since (2) is obvious from the definition, we prove (1). Now we know
the size of H2e ,2er . The degree is equal to the size of G1 ∪ −G1 . Since
|G1 | = 2r − 1, we shall prove that G1 and −G1 are disjoint. If ξ k = −ξ l for
some 0 ≤ k, l ≤ 2r − 2, then ξ k−l = −1. When k = l, this contradicts the
fact that the characteristic of GR(2e , 2er ) is 2e > 2. When k 6= l, we see that
−1 ∈ G1 and it generates the cyclic subgroup of order 2, which contradicts
the fact that the order of G1 is odd.

Now we get the following theorem.
Theorem 3.4.
(1) All eigenvalues of the graph H2e ,2er except for the
r
r
r
r
r+1
degree 2 −2 are in the interval [−2e+ 2 +2 2 +1 −2, 2e+ 2 −2 2 +1 +2].
(2) For every odd prime p ≥ 3, all eigenvalues of the graph Hpe,per except
r
r
r
for the degree pr − 1 are in the interval [−pe+ 2 −1 + p 2 − 1, pe+ 2 −1 −
r
p 2 + 1].
This theorem can be proved by the following result which is an analogue
of a Weil-Carlitz-Uchiyama type estimation of character sums over finite
fields. The following estimation is a special case of the result proved by
Kumar-Helleseth-Calderbank [9].
Lemma 3.5 (Kumar-Helleseth-Calderbank [9]). For α = b0 + b1 p + · · · +
be−1 pe−1 where b0 , b1 , . . . , be−1 ∈ G1 ∪ {0}, let iα := min{i | bi 6= 0, 0 ≤
i ≤ e − 1} and Nα := pe−1−iα . Then, for every non-trivial character ψ of
GR+ (pe , per ) and α 6= 0,
X
√
ψ(αs) ≤ (Nα − 1) pr + 1.
(3.1)
s∈G1

Especially, maxα6=0 Nα = pe−1 .
Proof of Theorem 3.4. It is known that if Γ is an abelian group, the following
set is the multi-set of |Γ| eigenvalues of Cay(Γ, S):
nX
o
ψ(s) | ψ is a character of Γ .
s∈S

P
Thus each eigenvalue of H2e ,2er is expressed by s∈G1 ∪−G1 ψ(s) for a char+ (2e , 2er ). Similarly, for p ≥ 3, each eigenvalue of H e er is
acter ψ of GRP
p ,p
expressed by s∈G1 ψ(s) for a character ψ of GR+ (pe , per ). (2) is a direct
consequence of Lemma 3.5. And since G1 and −G1 are disjoint when p = 2,
(1) is also proved by Lemma 3.5.

By Theorem 3.4, we get the following condition for connectivity.
Corollary 3.6. For each p, H2e ,2er and Hpe,per are connected if e < r/2+ 1.

Proof. The diameter of a graph G is the maximal length of the shortest
paths in G. If G is disconnected, the diameter is defined as ∞. Then it is
not so difficult to show that G is connected if its diameter is finite. For a
d-regular graph of G on n vertices whose eigenvalues other than d are in the
interval [−λ, λ], Chung [5] showed that
(3.2)

(the diameter of G) ≤

log(n − 1)
.
log( λd )

This bound implies that G is connected if λ < d. By Theorem 3.4, this is
ensured when e < r/2 + 1 for both graphs.

By Theorem 3.4, we get many expander graphs which have the sparseness
similar to those of the Chung’s graphs [5] and its generalizations in [8], [13],
[15] and [16]. For example, for each fixed e and p, they form the infinite
families {H2e ,2er }r≥1 and {Hpe ,per }r≥1 of expander graphs whose degrees are
the 1/e-th power of the sizes. Moreover the following corollary gives sparser
expander graphs. Constructions of graphs which have the similar sparseness
are also considered in Alon-Roichman [1].
Corollary 3.7. For each rational number 0 < δ ≤ 1/2 and for all r ≥ 1
such that δr is an integer, the following statements hold.
2
(1) The graph H2δr ,2δr2 is a connected (2r+1 − 2)-regular graph with 2δr
r

vertices such that λ(H2δr ,2δr2 ) ≤ 2(1/2+δ)r − 2 2 +1 + 2.
(2) For every odd prime p, the graph Hpδr ,pδr2 is a connected (pr − 1)2

regular graph with pδr vertices such that λ(Hpδr ,pδr2 ) ≤ p(1/2+δ)r−1 −
r

p 2 + 1.

Moreover, for the graph H2e ,2er , we get the following theorem on girth of
the graphs which is defined as the length of the shortest cycle.
Theorem 3.8. If r is odd and e ≥ 2, the graph H2e ,2er is triangle-free, that
is, the girth of H2e ,2er is more than 4. Moreover if r is odd and e = 2, the
girth of H4,4r is 4.
Proof. The second statement follows from the first statement and Theorem
4.2 in [11]. We prove the first statement.
In general, Cay(Γ, S) is triangle-free if the equation x + y + z = 0 has
no solutions in S. So we shall prove that for every 0 ≤ j, k, l ≤ 2r − 2, the
equation ξ j ± ξ k ± ξ l = 0 does not hold. We may assume that j, k, l are
distinct since if not, the above inequality does not hold because ξ j , ξ k and
ξ l are invertible. Without loss of generality, we may consider the following
three cases. The proof below is very similar to the discussion in [6, Section
III. C].
Case 1. When ξ j − ξ k ± ξ l = 0, then we get 1 + ξ a = ξ b for some 0 ≤ a 6=
b ≤ 2r − 2. By squaring the both sides, we obtain 1 + 2ξ a + ξ 2a = ξ 2b . On
the other hand, we also obtain 1 + ξ 2a = ξ 2b since φ(1 + ξ a ) = φ(ξ b ) and

6

SHOHEI SATAKE

φ is a ring automorphism. So 2ξ a = 0, which contradicts the fact that the
characteristic of GR(2e , 2er ) is 2e > 2.
Case 2. When ξ j + ξ k + ξ l = 0, then we get 1 + ξ a = −ξ b for some
0 ≤ a 6= b ≤ 2r − 2. Assume that a 6= 2b. Similarly for Case 1, by
squaring the both sides, we obtain 1 + 2ξ a + ξ 2a = ξ 2b . On the other hand,
we also obtain 1 + ξ 2a = −ξ 2b by φ. So 2(ξ a − ξ 2b ) = 0, which contradicts
by Lemma 3.2.
Case 3. Assume that a = 2b in Case 2. Then 1 + ξ b + ξ 2b = 0. Let
θ := µ(ξ) ∈ F2r (recall the definition of µ in Section 2). By applying µ for
the above equality, we get θ 2b + θ b + 1 = 0. Thus θ b is a zero of the equation
x2 + x + 1 = 0 in F2r . It contradicts the fact that this quadratic equation
has no solutions in F2r when r is odd. In fact, tr(x2 + x + 1) = r 6= 0 for all
x ∈ F2r when r is odd. Here tr is the field trace from F2r to F2 .

Remark 3.9. It seems to be interesting to investigate the girth of Hpe,per
and H2e ,2er in general cases. At this point, we did not obtain any result
except for the case of H2e ,2er when r is odd.
4. Ramanujan graphs from Galois rings of characteristic 4
Here we consider the Cayley graph H4,4r = Cay(GR+ (4, 4r ), G1 ∪ −G1 ).
The following theorem shows that {H4,4r }r≥4 is an infinite family of Ramanujan graphs.
Theorem 4.1. H4,4r is a Ramanujan graph of degree 2r+1 − 2 with 4r
vertices for all r ≥ 4. Moreover all eigenvalues except for the degree are
in the interval [−2r/2+1 − 2, 2r/2+1 + 2].
We can prove it by using Lemma 3.5, but here we prove by an elementary
eigenvalue estimation based on the discussion in [3]. Since G1 and −G1 are
P
disjoint, it suffices to evaluate ζγ := s∈G1 ω T (γs) for each γ ∈ GR(4, 4r )
√
where ω := −1, a primitive 4th root of unity. It is easy to see that ζ0 = 2r −
1. Boztas-Hammons-Kumar [3, Theorem 4] gave the following evaluation of
this sum by using only elementary calculation and an observation based on
fundamental facts of GR(4, 4r ).
Lemma 4.2 (Boztas-Hammons-Kumar [3]). If γ ∈ GR∗ (4, 4r ), then
(4.1)

2r/2 − 1 ≤ |ζγ | ≤ 2r/2 + 1.

If γ ∈ GR(4, 4r ) \ GR∗ (4, 4r ) and γ 6= 0 then

(4.2)

ζγ = −1.

Proof. First for each γ ∈ GR∗ (4, 4r ), the residue classes of G1 in GR∗ (4, 4r )
can be expressed as follows:
(4.3)

r −2

γG1 , −γG1 , (1 − ξ)γG1 , (1 − ξ 2 )γG1 , . . . , (1 − ξ 2

)γG1 .

and under the above partition, one can also see that
GR(4, 4r ) \ GR∗ (4, 4r ) = 2γG1 ∪ {0}.

(4.4)

This is a consequence of Lemma 1 in [3] (see also the equation (4.4) in [3]).
Next when γ ∈ GR∗ (4, 4r ),

because ω = ω −1 = ω 3 , ω 0 = ω −0 = 1 and ω 2 = ω −2 = −1. Now, since in
the 0-2 sequence (T (s))s∈2GR(4,4r ) , the frequency of 0 is equal to the number
of occurrences of 2, we get
X
ω T (s) = 0.
(4.7)
s∈2GR(4,4r )

In fact, let K := {s ∈ 2GR(4, 4r ) | T (s) = 0}. It is easy to see that there
exists α ∈ 2GR(4, 4r ) such that T (α) = 2. If α ∈ 2GR(4, 4r ) and T (α) = 2,
then T (α + β) = 2 for all β ∈ K. Conversely, if α′ ∈ 2GR(4, 4r ) such that
T (α′ ) = 2, T (α + (α′ − α)) = 2 and α′ − α ∈ K since 2GR(4, 4r ) is an ideal.
Thus |{s ∈ 2GR(4, 4r ) | T (α) = 2}| = |{α + β | β ∈ K}| = |K|. Thus by the

Thus by (4.9), (4.10) and (4.11), we get |1 + ζγ |2 = 0, proving the second
statement.

Remark 4.3. The proofs of (4.8) and (4.11) are obtained by a slight modification of the original proof in [3, p.1105]. By our proof, we can reduce the
facts of Galois rings which we need to use.
Now we are ready to prove the Theorem 4.1.
Proof of Theorem 4.1. By Lemma 4.2 we see that
(4.12)

λ(H4,4r ) ≤ 2r/2+1 + 2.

Thus by Proposition 3.3 and (4.12), H4r is a Ramanujan graph for r ≥ 4.
The second statement can also be obtained from Lemma 4.2.

5. Other spectral properties of H4,4r
In this section, we show some interesting spectral properties of the graphs
H4r . At first, we review some definitions. A graphPG is called integral if
every eigenvalue of G is an integer. Let E(G) :=
λ |λ| where λ moves
over all eigenvalues of G. E(G) is called the energy of G. Moreover G is
called hyperenergetic if G has n vertices and E(G) > 2(n − 1). Integral
graphs and the energy of graphs have been investigated in graph theory and

other various areas such as mathematical chemistry and number theory. For
details and related works, see [2], [10] and [12].
Now we get the following results.
Theorem 5.1. For r ≥ 2, H4,4r is integral.
Proof. Since the real part and imaginary part of ζγ are integers and all
eigenvalue of H4,4r must be real, the theorem is proved.

Theorem 5.2. For r ≥ 2, H4,4r is hyperenergetic.
Proof. Let nr be the number of vertices of H4,4r . By Lemma 4.2, there are
|GR∗ (4, 4r )| = 4r − 2r eigenvalues such that their absolute values are more
than 2r/2+1 − 1. And there are 2r − 1 eigenvalues which is equal to −2 and
one eigenvalue 2r − 1. Thus,
r

(5.1)

E(H4r ) ≥ |2 2 +1 − 1| · (4r − 2r ) + | − 2| · (2r − 1) + |2r − 1| · 1

= 2(nr ) 4 − nr − 2(nr ) 4 + 4(nr ) 2 − 3

So H4,4r is hyperenergetic if r ≥ 2.

6. Concluding remark
At last, we remark that for each invertible element γ ∈ GR∗ (pe , per ), we
can define two Cayley graphs H2γe ,2er := Cay(GR+ (2e , 2er ), γG1 ∪ −γG1 )
and Hpγe ,per := Cay(GR+ (pe , per ), γG1 ). For these graphs, we can obtain
the same results as Theorem 3.4, 3.8., 4.1. Especially, we can prove the
same statements as Theorem 5.1 and 5.2. On the other hand, for each
γ ∈ pGR(pe , per ), we can define Cayley digraphs as above. However, they
are not strongly-connected since the multiplicity of the largest eigenvalue is
more than 2 and by the Perron-Frobenius theorem.
