The recently-introduced concept of “synthetic dimensions” allows for the realization of higherdimensional topological phenomena in lower-dimensional systems. In this work we study the complementary aspect that synthetic dimensions provide a natural route to topological states in mesoscopic hybrid devices. We demonstrate this for the current induced into a closed one-dimensional
Aharonov-Bohm ring by the interaction with a dynamic mesoscopic magnet. The quantization of
the magnetic moment provides a synthetic dimension that complements the charge motion around
the ring. We present a direct mapping that places the combined ring-magnet system into the class
of quantum Hall models, and demonstrate that topological features, combined with the magnet’s
anisotropy, can lead to clear signatures in the persistent current of the single-particle ground state.

The recent approach of “synthetic dimensions” has
been opening up new routes to realising topological
energy bands in engineered systems of atoms or photons [1, 2]. This idea exploits the internal degrees of
freedom in a system by reinterpreting, for example, N
distinct internal states as a set of N lattice sites along
an extra synthetic spatial dimension [3]. Similar to earlier proposals for simulating higher-dimensional models
by increasing lattice connectivity [4, 5], this provides a
way to effectively increase spatial dimensionality. This
means that a system with one real spatial and one synthetic dimension can access two-dimensional topological
phenomena, such as quantum Hall models with topological energy bands and corresponding robust chiral edge
modes that propagate one-way around the system [1].
Since the first theoretical works in cold atoms [1, 3],
there has been a rapid development of both proposals
and experiments to realize different implementations of
a synthetic dimension [2, 6–24]. However, so far, this
activity has primarily focused on photonic or atomic setups, instead of on solid-state electronic systems. In this
paper, we show that the concept of a synthetic dimension,
in fact, emerges naturally also in the solid-state context
of a mesoscopic ring coupled to a nanomagnet.
The induction of a current around a closed ring by a
magnetic flux is an archetypical mesoscopic effect [25].
Such a current can flow even in equilibrium, where the
persistent current is a property of the ground state. This
bears some analogies to the dc Josephson current that
flows across a weak link between two superconductors
with different phases of the superconducting order parameter, which can for instance be induced by a magnetic
flux through a superconducting ring. In normal rings, the
current occurs as a mesoscopic effect at very low temperatures, and when measured precisely agrees with the
predictions of a simple single-particle picture [26, 27].
In this paper, we study the case where the magnetic
flux through the ring is created by a dynamical mesoscopic nanomagnet. After introducing the set-up, we

closed ring. The current is the response to the magnetic flux
Φ induced by the field B, which couples to the momentum
pϕ of a charge moving around the ring. (b) The situation described in (a) can be mapped to an artificial two-dimensional
(cylindrical) lattice indexed by the angular coordinate ϕ of
the particle on the ring and the spin quantum number, m of
the nanomagnet. The former corresponds to a continuous and
periodic (real) spatial dimension, while the latter is a discrete
(synthetic) dimension with 2s + 1 sites.

show that this hybrid system can be understood in a
single-particle picture as a synthetic two-dimensional lattice spanned by the position of the electron around the
mesoscopic ring together with the magnetic spin states,
which serve as a discrete synthetic dimension. The
coupling of the electron to the nanomagnet can be reinterpreted as an artificial magnetic field in this synthetic two-dimensional lattice, mapping the model to a
two-dimensional quantum Hall system. As we show, the
mesoscopic ring-magnet system is characterised by topological energy bands and topological “edge” modes, corresponding to spin-polarized chiral currents around the
ring. These topological modes can lead to characteristic
spin-switching jumps in the ground-state persistent current. These results show that synthetic dimensions are
relevant also in the solid state, providing a useful viewpoint for revealing topological effects in a setting with
potential electronic applications.
Setup: In our hybrid system, a magnetic flux passing

2
through a mesoscopic ring is created by a nanomagnet,
represented by a total spin S with spin quantum number s, as shown schematically in Fig. 1(a). The total
magnetic flux piercing the ring depends on the magnet’s spin state, as labelled by the quantum number
m = −s, −s + 1, · · · , s. The presence of the flux induces
electrons to move around the ring, such that the system
is characterised by the spin state, m, together with the
angular coordinate, ϕ, of the moving (spinless) charge.
The key concept of our proposal is to map this hybrid
set-up to a two-dimensional quantum Hall system on a
cylinder, by re-interpreting each spin state m as a different lattice site along a synthetic dimension, as sketched
in Fig. 1(b). As we will show, this analogy goes far.
The combined magneto-electronic states form flattenedout bands with nonzero Chern numbers and chiral edge
states according to the bulk-boundary correspondence.
These chiral edge states have a simple interpretation in
terms of a robust mesoscopic spin-orbit locking. As we
furthermore show, this effect leaves direct signatures in
the persistent current in the ground state of the combined
system.
Hamiltonian of the hybrid system: Before illustrating
the mapping to a synthetic dimension, we introduce the
Hamiltonian of the hybrid ring-magnet system [Fig. 1(a)].
We shall assume that the magnetic moment of the nanomagnet is aligned with its spin so that the flux induced
into the ring is proportional to the spin operator Sz ,
which at the same time is taken to align with one of
the principal axes of the magnet’s matrix of inertia. The
spin quantum numbers m introduced above then correspond to the eigenvalues of Sz . In a suitable gauge, the
vector potential felt by a charged particle on the ring has
a component Aϕ ∝ ρSz where ρ is the ring radius. In
appropriate units, the Hamiltonian for a single electron
then takes the simple form
H=

1
2
(−i∇ϕ − γSz ) + αSx2 + βSy ,
2M ρ2

(1)

where the kinetic-energy term includes the effect of the
magnetic flux via minimal coupling with strength γ. The
remaining terms describe the dynamics of the magnet as
a rigid body, where αSx2 determines its anisotropy while
additional quadratic terms can be partially eliminated
using the fact that Sx2 + Sy2 + Sz2 is a c-number (thus
absorbing a constant into the energy). The term βSy inducing a preferred orientation is included for completeness, while additional linear terms do not further affect
the robust aspects on which we concentrate here.
Mapping to a synthetic dimension: We map the
Hamiltonian (1) to a 2D quantum Hall system, by reinterpreting the eigenstates |mi of Sz as different lattice
sites along a synthetic dimension [Fig. 1(b)]. In this language, the Sx and Sy operators lead to “hoppings” along
the synthetic dimension, as they can be expressed by ladder operators as Sx = (S+ + S− )/2 and Sy = (S+ − S− )/2i

with
S+ |mi =

p

s(s + 1) − m(m + 1)|m + 1i ≡ 2tm |m + 1i

S− |mi =

p

s(s + 1) − m(m − 1)|m − 1i = 2tm−1 |m − 1i.

Using these relations, the Hamiltonian (1) can be cast
into a second-quantized form,

where ĉ†ϕ,m (ĉϕ,m ) creates (annihilates) an excitation in
the state indexed by ϕ and m. Note that, as this is
a hybrid system, these excitations physically correspond
to the occupation of a composite state |ϕ, mi, with the
electron at angular position ϕ on the ring and the nanomagnet in the spin state m.
Reinterpreting both m and ϕ as spatial coordinates,
the Hamiltonian (2) is analogous to that of a single particle on a 2D cylinder [Fig. 1(b)]. The dimension spanned
by ϕ is continuous and periodic (ϕ + 2π = ϕ), while that
spanned by m is discrete with a finite number of lattice sites, N = 2s + 1. Under this mapping, the first
line in the Hamiltonian (2) describes the kinetic energy
along the ϕ direction, whereas the second and third lines
provide the on-site potential energy as well as hoppings
(kinetic energy) along the spin (m) direction. Furthermore, the factor of −γm appearing in the kinetic energy
in the ϕ direction can be recognised as a vector potential
in the Landau gauge, corresponding to a uniform synthetic magnetic field through the ϕ–m plane. Thus this
hybrid system mimics a particle moving on a cylinder in
the presence of a uniform magnetic field.
Relationship to standard quantum Hall systems: As we
verify below, our model (2) therefore belongs to the class
of 2D quantum Hall systems, with energy bands characterised by nontrivial topological Chern numbers. However, unlike most standard quantum Hall Hamiltonians,
our system is continuous in one direction and discrete in
the other. This is known as a “coupled wire” configuration, as was first introduced theoretically as a tool for
constructing fractional quantum Hall states [28]. At a
single-particle level, such coupled wire models have also
recently become of interest due to experimental proposals
for ultracold atoms [29], and, in the context of synthetic
dimensions, for coupled optical cavities [19].
Compared to previously-studied coupled wire models, however, our system (2) has unusual nearest- and
next-nearest-neighbour hoppings along the spin direction. For example, these hopping amplitudes are nonuniform, meaning that translational invariance is broken
even away from the synthetic “edges” of the system at

3
m = ±s. Such hopping anisotropy is often a feature of
synthetic dimensions [1, 10], and topological properties,
such as the existence of chiral edge states, are expected
to be robust provided that the anisotropy is sufficiently
weak [1, 10], as we now also demonstrate here.
Topological properties: To calculate the bulk topological properties and anticipate the key signatures of the
synthetic magnetic field, we first assume that the hopping along the spin direction is uniform, in order to make
analytical arguments. Afterwards, we will revisit this assumption and verify that non-uniformity does not significantly modify the topological states. To proceed, we
introduce the angular momentum quantum number lϕ
around the ring, which is constrained to take only integer values due to the periodicity of ϕ. Assuming uniform
hopping, tm ≈ t, the Hamiltonian is

(3)
where ĉ†lϕ ,m is the Fourier transform of ĉ†ϕ,m along the ϕ
direction, and we have omitted a constant energy offset
term. This Hamiltonian does not couple operators with
different lϕ . We thus have, for a given value of lϕ , a one
dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian along the spin direction, where the first term in (3) is a harmonic trapping
potential centered at m = lϕ /γ and the other terms are
hopping terms. This is reminiscent of the ordinary Landau level problem, except that the spin direction, m, and
the momentum, lϕ , are both discrete. Note that, in general, lϕ /γ is not an integer, and thus the center of the
trapping potential falls between lattice sites in spin direction. Due to the discreteness of the spin direction, the
energy levels are not completely flat, although, practically, as we see below, we observe very flat energy levels
for low-lying states in the bulk of the synthetic 2D system. The emergence of these flat Landau levels is a key
signature of the synthetic magnetic field.
If we regard the energy levels as a function of lϕ as
energy bands, we can calculate their topological Chern
numbers analytically, finding that the Chern number of
every band is always equal to one regardless of the values of α and β [34]. This behaviour agrees with previous studies of coupled wire models [19, 28, 29], where
α = 0. The non-zero value of the Chern number implies
that, from the bulk-boundary correspondence, between
the nth and (n+1)th bulk energy levels there are n chiral
edge modes at each boundary m = ±s. Physically, these
edge modes correspond to spin-dependent chiral currents
flowing around the ring; as the largest and smallest spin
states serve as the edges of the synthetic spin dimension,
the edge-mode chirality means that there are currents
mainly involving spin states m = s flowing in one direction around the ring, and currents with m = −s flowing

spin of the corresponding states. We observe that states corresponding to dispersive regions have spins concentrated around
the edge of the synthetic dimension (m = ±s), whereas lowlying nondispersive regions have spin concentrated away from
the edge in the synthetic dimension. This spin dependence of
the energy dispersion shows that we have chiral edge states
in the synthetic two-dimensional lattice.

in the opposite direction. This is the second key signature of the synthetic magnetic field.
While we arrived at these expectations assuming uniform hopping tm = t, the result is more general. In the
original Hamiltonian (2), the momentum lϕ is also a good
quantum number. As we introduce back non-uniformity
of the hoppings, the bands as a function of lϕ can become
deformed, but as long as band gaps do not close, topological properties, such as the number of chiral edge modes
which appear at m = ±s, do not change. Nonetheless,
the anisotropy of the full model leaves characteristic fingerprints, as we demonstrate below.
Energy spectrum: To illustrate the topological robustness of the edge states in the full anisotropic model (2)
we plot the energy spectrum in Fig. 2. Panel (a) shows
the energy spectrum as a function of lϕ , normalized by
the total spin s = 10 with α = 1.5/(2M ρ2 ), β = 0, and
γ = 1.2. The low-lying levels with small |lϕ | show weak
dispersion; these are almost-flat Landau levels. Since
β = 0, states with even m and odd m do not couple, so
that these levels are nearly two-fold degenerate. Plotted
in dashed lines are ideal bulk Landau level energies calculated from Eq. (3), assuming tm to be equal to t0 and
lϕ = 0. They agree well with the energy spectrum for
low-lying states, verifying that the introduction of nonuniform hopping tm does not alter the basic phenomenon
of bulk Landau levels.
Away from the central region, we see that Landau levels split into two and eventually move up in energy, corresponding to chiral edge states, with states concentrated
around m = s propagating in one direction and those
concentrated around m = −s propagating in the opposite direction. To clearly see the nature of these chiral
edge states, we plot the spin expectation value of these

4
eigenstates in color in Fig. 2(b). States in red are concentrated on the edge at m = s, and states in blue are
on the other edge at m = −s, showing that the propagating states are edge states in the synthetic dimension.
Since each bulk Landau level eventually moves up in energy and becomes an edge state as |lϕ | increases, the net
number of chiral edge modes propagating in the same direction is equal to the number of bands below the energy.
This observation is in agreement with the fact introduced
above that each Landau level has a Chern number of one.
Including a nonzero β splits the nearly two-fold degeneracy of the Landau levels, but otherwise does not significantly alter the energy spectrum [34]. In particular,
the bulk levels remain flat, and each bulk level still leads
to one chiral edge mode. The robustness of these edge
modes in the energy spectrum reflects their topological
nature.
Persistent currents of the single-particle ground state:
As established on general grounds above, a key hallmark
of our model is the appearance of localised edge modes
with respect to the synthetic dimension of spin states.
Importantly, the interplay of this physics with the magnet’s anisotropy also leads to clear signatures in the persistent current of the single-particle ground state of the
combined system. To illustrate this, we now pierce the
ring with an extra externally-controlled flux Φext , so that
Hamiltonian (1) becomes

where the expectation values are taken with respect to

is shown in Fig. 3(a), for the parameters of Fig. 2, where
the colors denote the mean spin of the magnet, indicating that the ground-state persistent current is associated
with large spin-polarizations. This can be understood by
noting that the lowest energy states in Fig. 2 are modes
localised at edges of the spin synthetic dimension. Although the existence of edge modes is a general characteristic of quantum Hall systems, their dominance in
the ground state is a new feature due to the magnetic
anisotropy; for α > 0, as in Fig. 3(a), the anisotropy
favours extremal spin values, as it generates an inverted
harmonic trap α(t2m + t2m−1 ) = α[s(s + 1) − m2 ] in the
synthetic dimension (2) as well as non-uniform hopping
terms. Instead, if α < 0, the ground state and hence the
persistent current are localised around the middle of the
synthetic dimension, as is shown in Fig. 3(b).

state as a function of the externally-controlled flux Φext , for
(a) α = 1.5/(2M ρ2 ) and (b) α = −1.5/(2M ρ2 ), with other
parameters as in Fig. 2, where the colors represent the average
spin, hSz i/s. For both (a) and (b), the persistent current
jumps when there is a transition in the lowest energy state as
shown in panels (c) and (d) respectively. Notably, when α > 0
in (a) and (c), the ground state is dominated by the edge
modes, and the persistent current exhibits characteristic spinswitching jumps whenever the magnetic flux is increased by a
half flux quantum. On the other hand, when α < 0 in (b) and
(d), the ground state is localised in the middle of the synthetic
dimension with |hSz i/s| < 0.1, and the persistent current only
jumps if the magnetic flux is increased by a flux quantum, as
is typical also in a quantum ring without a nanomagnet.

Another clear and unusual signature of the edge modes
is in the spin-switching jumps of the persistent current in
Fig. 3(a), occuring whenever Φext /Φ0 = n/2, with n being any integer; in Fig. 3(b), by contrast, the persistent
current only jumps when n is an odd integer. Physically,
these jumps correspond to parameters where the ground
state becomes doubly-degenerate and then switches between different values of lϕ , as shown in Fig. 3(c) and
(d), where we plot the lowest energy states for panels (a)
and (b) respectively.
Analytically, we can easily understand the groundstate transitions in the limit α = β = 0, as then the
Hamiltonian (S13) predicts possible degeneracies between states with quantum numbers (lϕ , m) and (−lϕ +
2Φext /Φ0 , −m) [34]. As lϕ is an integer, this implies
transitions between states with opposite spins when
Φext /Φ0 = n/2. However, if m = 0 as in the usual quantum ring without a magnet, half of these degeneracies are
not real as (lϕ , 0) and (−lϕ + 2Φext /Φ0 , 0) can indicate
the same ground state [34]. Numerically, we find that this
distinction persists as we turn on the other parameters
as shown in Fig. 3, leading to twice as many transitions
in the ground state when it is localised at the edges of
the synthetic dimension as compared to the center.
Conclusion: In conclusion, we have demonstrated that

5
hybrid nanomagnetic-electronic mesoscopic systems can
display topological effects based on the interpretation of
the nanomagnet spin as a synthetic dimension. The key
signatures are flat Landau-level bands and spin-polarized
chiral currents. In the presence of an additional external magnetic flux, the magnet’s anisotropy leads to spinswitching behavior in the persistent current of the singleparticle ground state. While we have focussed on the
mesoscopic interpretation of the system it is worthwhile
mentioning that the components are generic and can be
realized in other ways, in particular using synthetic quantum engineering. For instance, we can envisage quantumoptical realizations in which the large spin arises from the
collective interactions of two-level systems as in a Dicke
model [30] and the flux is induced via an artificial gauge
field [31], and similar atom-optical realizations in which
the described effects may serve as robust tools for quantum control [32, 33].

in which the hopping along spin direction is assumed to be uniform (tm = t). We also assume there is no edge along
the m direction so that we can look at the bulk properties of the Hamiltonian.
The Chern number can be calculated by first obtaining the Berry curvature and then integrating the Berry curvature
over momentum space. The Berry curvature should thus be a function of momenta along two directions. One tricky
aspect of calculating the Berry curvature for our model is that, although the angular momentum lϕ is a good quantum
number, the momentum along the spin direction is not a good quantum number. This is a common problem which
one encounters if one wants to calculate the Chern number of Landau levels in a continuous space. A way to go around
this problem is to use magnetic translational symmetry instead of translational symmetry to construct momenta in
two directions. This defines a magnetic unit cell, which is a unit cell in which one encloses a magnetic flux of 2π.
For this, we consider a segment of length aϕ along ϕ direction and am lattice sites along m direction. Since γ is the
strength of the magnetic field penetrating through the synthetic two-dimensional space, aϕ and am should satisfy
aϕ am γ = 2π.
We will consider the magnetic Brillouin zone in quasimomentum space spanned by lϕ - pm , assuming that the
segment spanned by aφ - am is a magnetic unit cell in real space, and calculate the topological properties. We
assume that γ = P/Q where P and Q are mutually prime integers. The magnetic Brillouin zone has the size of
2π/aϕ along lϕ direction and 2π/am along pm direction. Rewriting the kinetic energy term along ϕ direction as
(lϕ − γm)2 = γ(m − lϕ /γ)2 , we see that the Hamiltonian has the periodicity of lϕ → lϕ + P . Since the magnetic
Brillouin zone should be periodic with periodicity of lϕ → lϕ + 2π/aϕ , we see that 2π/aϕ should be an integer multiple
of P . Let us write that 2π/aϕ = P Z where Z is an integer. Then, from aϕ am γ = 2π, we see that am = QZ. Therefore,
aϕ = 2π/P Z and am = QZ; for a given γ = P/Q, we have the freedom of choosing Z when choosing a magnetic unit
cell in real space.
Let us take a particular lϕ component of the Hamiltonian (S1) and define

We label the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian by n, where n = 1 is the ground state, and express the n-th eigenstate as flϕ ,n (m). The eigenstate of the original Hamiltonian (before Fourier transformation along ϕ, but with the
simplification that tm = t) can be written as
ψlϕ ,n (ϕ, m) = eilϕ ϕ flϕ ,n (m).

(S3)

The function flϕ ,n (m) satisfies the periodicity flϕ +P,n (m + Q) = flϕ ,n (m), which we use frequently in the calculation
below.
The wavefunction ψlϕ ,n (ϕ, m) contains momentum along only one direction. In order to obtain momenta in two
directions, we now construct a linear superposition of states with different lϕ values: lϕ , lϕ ± 2π/aϕ , lϕ ± 4π/aϕ ,
lϕ ± 6π/aϕ , . . ., given by

This is a superposition of states with the same energy, and so this state is also an energy eigenstate of the original
Hamiltonian. The parameters (lϕ , pm ) can now be regarded as quasi-momenta defined within the Brillouin zone:
−π/aϕ ≤ lϕ ≤ π/aϕ and −π/am ≤ pm ≤ π/am . From this, we can finally define the magnetic Bloch states as

un,(lϕ ,pm ) (ϕ, m) ≡ e−i(lϕ ϕ+pm m) φn,(lϕ ,pm ) (ϕ, m) =

e−ipm (m−am l) eiϕ2πl/aϕ flϕ +2πl/aϕ ,n (m).

(S5)

These magnetic Bloch states fulfill the following unit-cell periodicity:
un,(lϕ ,pm ) (ϕ + aϕ , m) = un,(lϕ ,pm ) (ϕ, m)
un,(lϕ ,pm ) (ϕ, m + am ) = eiϕ2π/aϕ un,(lϕ ,pm ) (ϕ, m) = eiγam ϕ un,(lϕ ,pm ) (ϕ, m).

(S6)

This is exactly the periodicity that magnetic Bloch states should obey under the Landau gauge.
Now that we have the magnetic Bloch states, we can calculate the Berry connection, Berry curvature, and the
Chern number. First, let us check the normalization of our Bloch states

Therefore, regardless of the details of the hopping along m, which means that regardless of the details of α and β,
the Chern number of each band is always 1.

EFFECT OF A LINEAR TERM IN SPIN

Here we discuss in more detail the effect of including nonzero values of β, which is to include a linear term in spin
operator in the Hamiltonian. As discussed in the main text, when β = 0, odd sites and even sites along the spin
direction are decoupled, and thus the bulk spectrum is doubly degenerate. When nonzero β is present, this degeneracy
is lifted. In Fig. S1, we plot the energy spectra and their spin expectation values for various values of β, with all the
other parameters fixed to a common value. For β = 0, the spectrum is the same as the one plotted in Fig. 2 of the
main text. We can see that as β is increased from zero, the double degeneracy present for β = 0 is gradually lifted by
an almost-rigid shift. When β = 1.5/2M ρ2 , the lifted levels become again almost degenerate with the higher levels,
with the lowest level remaining nondegenerate. An important feature here is that, apart from this energy shift, the
main features, such as the flatness of the Landau levels in the bulk and the spin-polarization of the chiral edge states,
are unchanged. This robustness of the topological features is a consequence of the result of the previous section that
the Chern number of each band is one regardless of the values of α and β.

FIG. S1. Energy spectrum (black-and-white) and spin expectation values (color) for various values of β, which is given in units
of 1/2M ρ2 . Other parameters are the same as in Fig. 2 of the main text, i.e., s = 10, α = 1.5/(2M ρ2 ), and γ = 1.2.

GROUND-STATE TRANSITIONS

In this section, we provide more detail concerning the ground-state transitions for the persistent current shown
in the main text. As mentioned there, we can gain analytical insight into the transitions by starting from the limit
α = β = 0, in which the Hamiltonian is simply
H=

(S13)

As this Hamiltonian is diagonal with respect to both the angular momentum and the magnet polarisation, each
eigenstate can be labeled by the two integer quantum numbers (lϕ , m). It can then be immediately seen from
inspection of Eq. (S13) that an eigenstate labelled by (lϕ , m) can be degenerate with eigenstates labelled by: (i)
(−lϕ + 2Φext /Φ0 , −m), (ii) (−lϕ + 2Φext /Φ0 + 2γm, m), and (iii) (−lϕ + 2γm, −m).
Remembering that the angular momentum quantum number must be an integer then leads to the conditions that
respectively (i) Φext /Φ0 = n/2, (ii) Φext /Φ0 + γm = n/2, (iii) γm = n/2, where n is any integer. As can be seen,
the conditions (ii) and (iii) are not generic as they require fine-tuning of parameters to ensure that the spin quantum
number m is an integer in the range (−s, ..., s) as required, and hence the occurrence of these degeneracies is highly
sensitive to the value of γ. Hereafter, we therefore focus on (i) which is generic and only depends on the external flux.
As we are interested in the ground state, we can ask what value of the angular momentum, lϕ , in (S13) will lead to
the lowest energy for a given m, finding that

lϕ =
lϕ =

for Φext /Φ0 = n/2 when n is even,
for Φext /Φ0 = n/2 when n is odd.

(S14)

This suggests that the lower-energy states will include degeneracies between states labelled by
( n2
n−1
( 2

+ bγmc, m)

and

( n2 − bγmc, −m)

for Φext /Φ0 = n/2 when n is even,

+ bγmc, m)

and

( n+1
2 − bγmc, −m)

for Φext /Φ0 = n/2 when n is odd.

(S15)

Importantly, we note that for m = 0, the former trivialises when n is even as these are in fact the same state; this
is the well-known result that the persistent current of a single particle in a quantum ring jumps only at values of
Φext /Φ0 = n/2, where n is an odd integer.
So far, the above argument was based on assuming a given spin, m. However, the ground state will be the lowest
energy state over all allowed values of this spin. From the Hamiltonian (S13) it can be seen immediately that m = 0
will have zero energy whenever Φext /Φ0 = n/2, with n being even. As the energy from Eq. S13 is always positive,
there can be no states that are lower than zero energy, and so m = 0 will always contribute to the ground state.
(Other spin states will also be at zero energy if γm is an integer, and then the ground state is a superposition of
states.)
To go beyond this, we need to re-introduce terms such as those relating to the anisotropy and preferred orientation
of the magnet. As we see from the full Hamiltonian presented in the main text, these additional terms are diagonal in
the angular momentum and so lϕ remains a good quantum number. In general, the eigenstates and eigenspectrum of
this Hamiltonian are found numerically, as has been presented in the main text. Then, as shown in the main text, the
transitions predicted by Eq. (S15) can persist for the full Hamiltonian, leading to the spin-switching jumps observed
whenever Φext /Φ0 = n/2, with n being any integer.
This is possible because, for positive α, the ground state is no longer necessarily associated with m = 0, but can be
localised at the edges of the system. This can be intuitively understood by noting that α contributes both non-uniform
hopping terms as well as an inverted harmonic trapping potential, α(t2m +t2m−1 ) = α(s(s+1)−m2 ) along the synthetic
dimension, which, in particular, favours sites at the edges of the synthetic dimension.
Inspired by this, we consider only the effects of this inverted harmonic trap, so that we still have m as a good
quantum number. For this simplified situation, the ground-state, e.g. at Φext /Φ0 = n/2, will be determined by a
Hamiltonian
Hsimplified =

(bγmc − γm) − αm2 ,
2M ρ2

(S16)

where we have neglected an overall energy shift, and used the results obtained in Eq. (S15). From this we can
anticipate that the ground state will shifted from m = 0 as long as there is at least one non-zero allowed spin value,

5
2

m0 , for which αm20 > 2M1ρ2 (bγm0 c − γm0 ) . This is generically possible provided that α2M ρ2 , γ and s are large
enough.
As a final comment, we also observe numerically that increasing β serves to flatten out the dispersion, as shown
above. While this is an advantage for drawing the analogy with Landau levels, this may be a disadvantage if we want
to isolate only the edge modes in the ground state. Nevertheless, the predicted spin-switching jumps in the persistent
current should be observable provided that β is sufficiently small.
