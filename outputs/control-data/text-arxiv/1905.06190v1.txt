The recently discovered Fe-based superconductor (FeBS) LaFe2 As2 seems to break away from
an established pattern that doping FeBS beyond 0.2e/Fe destroys superconductivity. LaFe2 As2
has an apparent doping of 0.5e, yet superconducts at 12.1 K. Its Fermi surface bears no visual
resemblance with the canonical FeBS Fermiology. It also exhibits two phases, none magnetic and
only one superconducting. We show that the difference between them has nonetheless magnetic
origin, the one featuring disordered moments, and the other locally nonmagnetic. We find that
La there assumes an unusual valence of +2.6 to +2.7, so that the effective doping is reduced to
0.30-0.35e. A closer look reveals the same key elements: hole Fermi surfaces near Γ-Z and electron
ones near the X-P lines, with the corresponding peak in susceptibility, and a strong tendency to
stripe magnetism. The physics of LaFe2 As2 is thus more similar to the FeBS paradigm than hitherto
appreciated.

For more than a decade after the discovery of Fe-based
superconducting pnictides1 it seemed that superconductivity existed in a relatively narrow range of dopings away
from the nominal Fe2+ valency, between −0.2e and 0.15e,
and disappeared or was rapidly suppressed after that2 . It
was rationalized in terms of the Cooper pair scattering
between the hole pockets of the Fermi surface near the
zone center and electron pockets near its corner3 . One
of the few examples of strongly overdoped (up to Fe1.5+
valency) pnictides was provided by Hosono’s group4–6 ,
namely the 1111 material LaFeOAs, with up to 50% of
O2− replaced by H− . Intriguingly, they observed two
superconducting domes, possibly with different pairing
symmetries and/or mechanisms. Unfortunately, further
study of this material, both theoretical and experimental, has been hindered by the volatility of hydrogen and
natural disorder.
Recently, another compound with formally Fe1.5+
has been synthesized7 , LaFe2 As2 (La122), stoichiometric and isostructural with the arguably best studied
iron pnictide, BaFe2 As2 . It was found experimentally
that the material can exist in two distinctly different
crystallographic phases: as-prepared samples exhibit a
6.5% shorter crystallographic c-parameter and a 1.6%
shorter a-parameter than the same sample, annealed. In
Ref. 7 they were named “collapsed-tetragonal” (CT) and
“uncollapsed-tetragonal” (UT). The latter, but not the
former, was exhibiting superconductivity at 12.1 K. A
similar c parameter collapse had been observed in the
CaFe2 As2 (Ca122) compound, where it is triggered by
pressure and is accompanied by the formation of As-As
dimers8,9 , and by reduction of c and small increases of
a and b. The formation of the As-As bond was initially
considered to be the driving force for the collapse10 , but
a later investigation of Ca1−x Srx Fe2 As2 suggested11 that
what drives the collapse is the loss of magnetism, while
the As dimerization is a byproduct. At first glance, neither idea is applicable to La122, because the As-As bond
in the CT phase is considerably longer than in Ca122

(3.18 Å vs. 2.84 Å), and the experiment does not show
any ordered magnetism in the UT phase. Furthermore,
the Fermi surface calculated in Ref. 7, on the first glance,
bears no resemblance with that of the traditional iron
pnictides; especially the ubiquitous hole pockets near the
zone center seem to be absent.
In this contribution, we will address structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of La122, and will show
that the UT phase, as opposed to the CT one, carries a
strong short-range magnetism of the stripe type driven by
the next-nearest-neighbor exchange, with, however, different subdominant interactions. The structural changes
are driven by the magnetic collapse, as in Ca122. The
orbitals relevant for the low-energy physics are not the
usual dxz and dyz (these are nearly completely filled) but
dxy and dz2 instead. The former forms a quasi-2D cylinder at the zone center, which, contrary to the initial assertion, is quite similar to the hole pocket in traditional
iron pnictides. This fact was overlooked because a very
3D dz2 band forms a Fermi surface sheet that crosses
the dxy cylinder and hybridizes with it, hiding it from
view if every sheet is plotted separately. Most importantly, La in this compound assumes a non-integer valence closer to 2.7+ than to 3+, corresponding to doping
of ∼ 0.35e, rather than 0.5e; it is thus overdoped, but
not dramatically. The overextended electron pockets do
not exclude the usual spin-fluctuation driven mechanism
with an overall s symmetry. However, in such a scenario
the order parameter will nearly necessarily be nodal.
Methods.- We use density functional theory (DFT)
with a projector augmented wave basis as implemented
in VASP12 for structure prediction. All calculations employ a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange correlation functional13 . We use the all electron
full potential local orbital (FPLO) basis14 for electronic
structure analysis15 and energy mapping of magnetic
states16,17 . Based on a tight-binding model from projective Wannier functions18 , we determine a non-interacting
susceptibility19,20 .

TABLE I. Structural parameters of LaFe2 As2 as determined
experimentally (Ref. 7) and obtained by full structural relaxation.

First, we address the structural properties, using density functional theory (DFT) as a tool. In a similar compound, LaFe2 P2 , DFT was shown to reproduce the experiment in much detail, arguably better that in Fe2+
pnictides21,22 . We have performed the full optimization
of the crystal structure, using two approaches: one spinunrestricted, and the other enforcing a nonmagnetic Fe
state. In the former we have found the same stripeorder ground state as in BaFe2 As2 , with sizable magnetic
moments of 1.8 µB inside the Fe PAW sphere, slightly
smaller than in BaFe2 As2 . The structural parameters,
listed in Table I, were extremely close to those experimentally determined for the UT phase. In contrast, the
nonmagnetic calculations converged to a structure nearly
identical with the experimental CT structure. It had
been already well established (see, for instance, Ref. 23)
that in order to reproduce the crystal structure of paramagnetic iron pnictides one needs to account for the fluctuating local magnetic moments by allowing an appropriate
magnetic order. Otherwise, the Fe2+ ionic radius is too
small, the Fe-As bond too short, and c/a too small as
well. The only material where nonmagnetic calculations
generate a correct structure is the CT phase of Ca122.
In pure Ca122 one cannot disentangle the effect of magnetism and the effect of As-As bonding; it had been generally believed that both contribute to the collapse,and
one piece of evidence of the contrary11 has not been universally accepted. Our result clearly shows magnetism in
the driver seat. Experimentally and theoretically, As-As
bonding is much weaker in CT La122 than in CT Ca122,
yet their structural characteristics are amazingly similar.
Having established this fact, we have analyzed the
magnetic interaction by fitting the calculated total energies in the UT phase onto the four nearest neighbor
couplings of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian (the paths are
shown in Fig. 1 (a)). The results are presented in Table II. Similar to other pnictides, the next nearest neighbor interaction J2 (the one supporting the s± pairing24 )
dominates. Unlike those other materials, J1 is not only
smaller than 2J2 , assuring the stripe order, but is negligible. Furthermore, the third neighbor interaction, responsible for the double-stripe order in FeTe, is also quite
sizable in La122, but is ferro- rather than antiferromagnetic. It remains to be seen whether such an unusual
behavior would follow from the standard low-energy itinerant model25 and what particular effect it may have on
the pairing symmetry, but it is likely to modify the pair-

ing interaction in a substantial and interesting way.
To this end, let us now present a detailed description of
the electronic structure in the paramagnetic UT phase.
As usual, the calculations are performed in the nonmagnetic case, deemed to be a good approximation to the
paramagnetic state.
Fig. 2 shows the calculated band structure with the La
5d character highlighted, and Fig. 3 shows the bands and
Fermi surface cuts with Fe 3d characters.
First and foremost, we see that one of the two La-5d

has a huge dispersion, from its bottom at the Γ point at
−1.5 eV, to the top at X at +5 eV (Fig. 2). Because
of that, it becomes partially occupied, and, even though
there are no pure La bands at the Fermi level, it absorbs
some number of electrons, noticeably reducing the effective doping. Because of strong hybridization between this
band and Fe orbitals,there is no rigorous way to assess
this reduction. We have used two methods, one of which
is supposed to give a lower bound, and the other the up-

per bound. In both cases we started from a tight-binding
fit with all orbitals but Fe 3d and La 5d integrated out.
The fit is not perfect around the X point, but pretty good
closer to Γ and Z 0 . Then we zero non-diagonal elements
between La and Fe and calculate the number of electrons
in the (now pure) La 5d band. This gives us 0.22e per
La. Next, we take the original fit, with Fe-La hybridization, and integrate the La 5dxy partial density of states.
This gives 0.47e per La. We consider these two numbers

4

to be the lower and the upper bound, with 0.3-0.4e the
most likely number. Note that this corresponds to the
actual Fe doping of 0.30-0.35e/Fe, which is, of course,
past optimal, but not nearly as heavy as 0.5e.
Next, let us take a closer look at the Fe bands near
the Γ point. We see that the dxz /dyz bands that play
the leading role in the Fe2+ pnictides are now nearly entirely below the Fermi level in the vicinity of the Γ point
(they do form a tiny 3D hole pocket around Z, which
is basically irrelevant). This does not mean that the essential hole cylinder around Γ-Z is gone; the dxy band,
which appears in many, albeit not all Fe2+ pnictides, is
well visible near Γ, and the two cuts showing the vertical Γ-Z direction (Figures 3 (b) and (c)) show it to
be nearly 2D. This band is a perfect candidate for the
standard s± scenario. The reason that it was missed in
Ref. 7 is that at kz ∼ (Γ-Z)/2 it is cut across by another,
complicated Fermi surface, formed mostly by the dz2 orbital, which gets gradually mixed with other orbitals as
kx , ky increase. Note that this orbital extends along z
and is thus more dispersive along kz than in the kx -ky
plane. The corresponding Fermi surface is therefore very
three-dimensional. The dz2 sheet hybridizes with the dxy
cylinder, creating a visually complicated topology, which,
however, can be readily traced down to these two elements.
Having established the existence of a sizable quasi-2D
hole pocket near the Γ-Z line, let us see whether we can
reveal electron states sufficiently close to the X point to
recover the standard pairing scenario27 (note that because of the 3D character of the electronic structure we
are using the standard notations for the body-centered
tetragonal symmetry; point X in this notation corresponds to the M point in the often-used 2D nomenclature).
Again, let us begin with the dxz /dyz bands. At X they
sit at respectable 220 meV below the Fermi level, and
disperse upward pretty much in the same way as they do
in other iron pnictides. They strive to form a large Fermi
surface cylinder (kF ∼ π/2a), but this is interrupted by
hybridization with other bands, dxy and dz2 . Right in the
middle between Γ and Z, this hybridization is absent and
the Fermi surface cut at this kz looks amazingly similar
to the Fermi surface topology in typical iron pnictide
superconductors (Figure 3 (e)). Given that the usual
dxz /dyz hole pockets are absent, these states are unlikely
to play a leading role in superconductivity.
Interestingly, the dxy band also shows up near X.
While at X it is located deep below the Fermi level (∼ 0.8
eV), it disperses upward extremely rapidly, and along ΓX, where it cannot hybridize with the dxz /dyz bands by
symmetry, it crosses the Fermi level already at 0.2 of the
distance between Γ and X. Again, this simple Fermiology
is disrupted by hybridization with other states, except
along Γ-Z. However, it does not nullify the fact that
there are plenty of dxy states in the electronic pockets
around the X-P -X vertical line, which share the character with zone-center hole states, and can lead to the

same s± superconductivity as in Fe2+ pnictides, despite
a different doping level and visually extremely different
Fermi surface.
This description is very reminiscent of the well-known
scenario for superconductivity in optimally doped iron
pnictides, except that instead of the dxz /dyz band showing up in both hole and electron pockets, we have dxy .
With this in mind, we have calculated the noninteracting susceptibility, including the orbital-defined matrix elements. It is displayed in Figure 4. As expected, there is
a large peak near Q = (π/a, π/a, qz ), both at qz = 0 and
even stronger at qz = π/c. Together with the fact that
the calculated mean-field ground state is strongly stripetype antiferromagnetic, it convincingly suggests that the
dominant spin fluctuation has a (π/a, π/a) wave vector.
Note that the calculations provide a sizable antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, conforming to a global susceptibility maximum at Q = (π/a, π/a, π/c).
To summarize, we find that while LaFe2 As2 is unquestionably a unique, unusual and highly interesting material, many of its apparent mysteries may have simple
resolutions. First, the strange coexistence of two structurally different phases finds explanation in different local magnetic states of Fe ions – despite the absence of a
long range order in either. Second, the real doping level
of Fe bands is considerably smaller than the one derived
from a purely ionic picture. Third, the Fermi surface
of LaFe2 As2 is indeed very complex, but this complexity
hides the same basic motif as in traditional iron based superconductors: a hole pocket near Γ and electron pockets
near X. Fourth, spin fluctuations are also peaked near
Q = (π/a, π/a, qz ), potentially providing the necessary
superconducting “glue”.
