Unidirectional radiation is important for a variety of optoelectronic applications. Many unidirectional emitters exist, but they all rely on the use of materials or structures that forbid
outgoing waves, i.e. mirrors. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a class of resonances in photonic crystal slabs, which only radiate towards a single side
with no mirror placed on the other side — we call them “unidirectional bound states in the
continuum”. These resonances are found to emerge when a pair of half-integer topological
charges in the polarization field bounce into each other in the momentum space. We experimentally demonstrate such resonances in the telecommunication regime, where we achieve
single-sided quality factor as high as 1.6 × 105 , equivalent to a radiation asymmetry ratio of
27.7 dB. Our work represents a vivid example of applying topological principles to improve
optoelectronic devices. Possible applications of our work include grating couplers, photoniccrystal surface-emitting lasers, and antennas for light detection and ranging.
Topological defects1 , characterized by quantized invariants, offer a general picture to un1

derstand many exotic phenomena in the real space such as quantum vortices in superfluids and
singular optical beams2 . It has been recently found that topological defects can also emerge in the
momentum space, giving rise to interesting consequences. One such example are the bound states
in the continuum3 (BICs) in photonic crystal (PhC) slabs: these special resonances reside inside
the continuous spectrum of extended radiating modes, yet, counter-intuitively, remain spatially
confined and maintain infinitely long lifetimes.

Since initially proposed3 , BICs have been found in a variety of wave systems4–17 and have
been widely used in various applications18–20 . Although seemingly unconventional, BICs in PhC
slabs are fundamentally vortices in the momentum space, characterized by quantized integer topological charges21, 22 . The lack of a continuous definition of polarization at the vortex center forbids
far-field radiation from this resonance, in the presence of radiation channels, resulting in a BIC.
So far, most BICs realized in PhC slabs rely on spatial symmetries to reduce the number of independent radiation channels. For example, many BICs are found in up-down mirror symmetric
systems8, 21, 23, 24 , where no upward radiation necessarily implies no downward radiation. On the
other hand, whether or not unidirectional BICs — resonances that only radiate towards a single
side with no mirror placed on the other side25 — can exist has remained an open question.

Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate unidirectional BICs enabled
by topological charges in the polarization field of PhC slab resonances. Specifically, we first split
the integer topological charge carried by a BIC, by breaking certain spatial symmetries, into a pair
of half-integer topological charges: they each correspond to a circularly-polarized resonance in the

2

downward far-field radiation. As the structure is continuously varied, the two half-integer topological charges keep evolving in the momentum space until they bounce into each other and, again,
act like an integer charge. At this point, downward radiation from this resonance is disallowed
as its far-field polarization is undefined — this is the topological nature of unidirectional BICs.
We further fabricate PhC samples and experimentally demonstrate unidirectional BICs by directly
proving the vanishing of their downward far-field radiation.

We start by showing that unidirectional BICs can be achieved by first splitting and then
merging a pair of half-integer topological charges of polarization long axes in the momentum
space. As a specific example, we consider a 1D-periodic PhC slab where infinitely long bars with
gaps of w = 358 nm are defined in a 500 nm-thick silicon layer with refractive index of n = 3.48 at
a periodicity of a = 772 nm (Fig. 1a-d). Both the top and bottom silica cladding layers (n = 1.46)
are assumed to be semi-infinitely thick. When the sidewalls of the bars are vertical (θ = 90◦ ,
Fig. 1b), the PhC slab is up-down and left-right symmetric, and a BIC is found on a TE-like band
(TE1) along the kx axis off the normal direction at kx a/2π = 0.176. In this up-down symmetric
structure, the radiative decay rate of a mode towards the top (γt , orange) is always the same as
that towards the bottom (γb , blue), both of which reduce to 0 at the BIC (middle panels, Fig. 1b).
Fundamentally, this BIC can be understood as a topological defect in the far-field polarization long
axes that carries an integer topological charge of q = +1, as the polarization long axis winds
around the BIC by 2π in the counter-clockwise (CCW) direction (yellow arrows, bottom panel,
Fig. 1b).

3

As one of the sidewalls is tilted away from being vertical (θ = 81◦ , Fig. 1c), the PhC slab
is no longer up-down symmetric, so γt and γb are no longer simply related. Importantly, no BIC
exists in this structure any more: the radiative decay rate towards either the top or bottom, γt,b ,
never reaches 0 (middle panels, Fig. 1c). The integer charge of the BIC has now split into a pair of
half-integer charges q = +1/2, each being a circularly-polarized resonance (bottom panel, Fig. 1c).
The two half-integer charges are related to each other by the y-mirror symmetry of the structure,
which also guarantees these two circularly polarized resonances to be opposite in helicity: CCW
for one (red) and clockwise (CW) for the other (green).

As the sidewalls are further tilted, the two circularly-polarized resonances in downward radiation keep moving in the momentum space following trajectories shown in Fig. 1e: red for CCW
and green for CW. There are no unidirectional BICs in the system until θ is decreased to 75◦
(Fig. 1d) and the CW and CCW trajectories meet on the kx axis. At this point, any downward
radiation needs to be both CW- and CCW-circularly polarized at the same time, which can never
be satisfied as the two polarization states are orthogonal to each other. As a result, this mode
cannot have any downward radiation even though no mirror is placed on the bottom and the radiation channel is open to it. This interpretation agrees with numerical simulation results, where
γb reaches 0 while γt remains finite — we name such resonances “unidirectional BICs” (middle
panels, Fig. 1d). From the viewpoint of topology, unidirectional BICs can be understood as the
merging point between two half-integer charges, where they act like an integer charge, forbidding
any radiative loss. See Supplementary Information Section I- III for more details.

4

Following our interpretation, unidirectional BICs can be designed by bouncing two halfinteger topological charges into each other while each representing a circularly-polarized resonance with opposite helicities. This mechanism does not depend on any structural symmetry and
can occur when the top and bottom cladding materials are different. Next, we present our unidirectional BIC design with air on the top and SiO2 on the bottom, which we fabricate and experimentally characterize later. The PhC slab consists of a periodic array of one-dimensional bars
defined in a 500 nm-thick silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer at the periodicity of a = 825 nm (left
panel, Fig. 2a). The sidewalls are tilted to specific angles, θL = 79◦ and θR = 75◦ , to achieve a
unidirectional BIC: as shown its mode profile of Ey component, downward radiation γb is significantly lower, by over 70 dB, than its upward radiation γt (right panel, Fig. 2a). The asymmetry
ratio between up- and downward radiation intensity, η = γt /γb , is calculated for different k-points
(color map, Fig. 2b), where the extremely bright spot marks the location of the unidirectional BIC
at kx a/2π = 0.0854. A line-cut of the color map along the kx axis shows the asymmetry ratio η
diverging into infinity, which is the characteristic feature of unidirectional BICs (Fig. 2c). Overlaid
on the color map in Fig. 2b is the polarization long axes plot for the downward far-field radiation
from nearby resonances; indeed, an integer winding of the polarization long axes, q = +1, is observed around the unidirectional BIC, which is consistent with our interpretation presented in Fig.
1d.

To verify our theoretical findings, we fabricate PhC samples with unidirectional BICs using
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, e-beam lithography, and reactive ion etching (RIE)
processes. The scanning electron microscope images are shown in Fig. 3a,b. Briefly, a thermal
5

SiO2 layer with thickness of approximately 110 nm is first deposited on the wafer as the hard
mask. Different from standard RIE processes that use horizontal substrates, our sample is placed
on a wedged substrate that allows us to etch the silicon layer at a slanted angle; as a result, highquality air gaps with tilted sidewalls are achieved (Fig. 3b). Because of the shadowing effect, the
angles of the left and right sidewalls are not identical: θL = 79◦ and θR = 75◦ . The width of the air
gaps w is swept from 340 to 360 nm, at the step of 2.5 nm to best capture the unidirectional BIC
design at w =352 nm. See Methods and Supplementary Information Section IV for more details
about the fabrication.

To demonstrate the existence of unidirectional BICs, up- and downward radiative decay
rates from our fabricated samples are independently characterized using the experimental setup26
schematically shown in Fig. 3c. A tunable telecommunication laser in the C+L-band is first sent
through a polarizer in the x-direction (POL) before it is focused by a lens (L1) onto the rear focal
plane (RFP) of an infinity-corrected objective lens. To achieve on-resonance coupling condition,
for each excitation wavelength λ, the incident angle is tuned, by moving L1 in the x − y plane,
to excite a resonance of the sample. Each excited resonance radiates towards the top and bottom
according to its radiative decay rate into each channel respectively. Upward (downward) far-field
radiation from this resonance is then collected by the con-focal setup shown on the right (left),
marked with a orange (blue) dashed box, where the beam is shrunk by 0.67 times through a 4f
system to best fit the camera. Our on-resonance excitation scheme here is similar to previously
reported results27–29 . See Methods and Supplementary Information Section V for more details.

6

As an example, the experimental comparison between up- and downward radiation from a
resonance at λ = 1551 nm is presented in Fig. 4a. Here, the excitation laser is on resonance
with a mode on the kx axis at ky a/2π = 0.01. Labeling of the momentum spaces is calibrated
with respect to the known numerical aperture of the objectives (NA=0.26), shown as white circles.
The characteristic feature of the unidirectional BIC — marked by a white arrow on the kx axis
— is qualitatively shown in the comparison between the two figures: for resonances near the

unidirectional BIC, downward radiation (X , Y , Z ) is always much weaker than upward radiation
(X, Y, Z). On the other hand, for resonances on the left half of the momentum space that are far
away from the unidirectional BIC, their up- and downward radiations are comparable.

A more quantitative demonstration of the unidirectional BIC is achieved by measuring the
asymmetry ratio of the resonances. Two movable pinholes (not shown in Fig. 3c) with diameters
of 300 µm are placed at the image planes of the objectives’ RFPs to select specific k points. Three

examples are shown in Fig. 4b, where upward (X, Y, Z) and downward (X , Y , Z ) radiation intensities are measured as the excitation wavelength scans through the three resonances. As expected,
all reflection and transmission spectra exhibit symmetric Lorentzian features27 : the excitation efficiency reaches its maximum when the excitation is on resonance, which happens at λ = 1553.7,
1551.2, and 1549.4 nm respectively. Accordingly, both central wavelengths λ and quality factors
Qtot of the resonances can be extracted by fitting the experimental results to Lorentzian functions.
Repeating this procedure for all resonances along the X-Z line, we achieve a good agreement
between experimentally-extracted resonance wavelengths (red crosses) and numerical simulation
results (blue line, Fig. 4c).
7

To demonstrate the existence of unidirectional BICs, we further experimentally extract the
downward radiative decay rate of the resonances γb = ω/Qb and show it reduces to 0 at certain
k points. Here, ω is the resonance frequency and Qb is the radiative quality factor that only accounts for the downward radiation. In practice, the observed total loss ω/Qtot is composed of
non-radiative loss due to absorption, scattering, lateral leakage30, 31 , and radiative losses towards
the top and bottom. As these resonances are close in the momentum space and share similar mode
profiles, it is reasonable to assume they share a similar non-radiative decay rate, which is found
to be Qnon−rad = 2080 through numerical fitting (see Supplementary Information Section VI for
details). Up- and downward radiative decay rates can be separated based on measured asymmetry
ratio η. Our experimentally extracted Qb are presented in Fig. 4c as red crosses, which show a good
agreement with the numerical simulation results (blue line). In particular, the fact that the bottom
radiation γb reduces to almost 0 as Qb diverges at kx a/2π = 0.088 proves our demonstration of
the unidirectional BIC.

At the unidirectional BIC (Y, Y ), the experimentally measured asymmetry ratio between
up- and downward radiation reaches a maximum of 27.7 dB, meaning over 99.8% of light radiates towards the top (Fig. 5a). Such highly directional radiation is essential and desirable in
many optoelectronic devices. For example, grating couplers32–36 , which couple light between the
nanophotonic waveguides and fibers, are among the most important elements in photonic integrated circuits. While having been studied extensively, the performance of grating couplers is
still far from optimal: one of the major challenges is the insertion loss that is now mainly limited
by unwanted downward radiation losses36 . Accordingly, the unidirectional BICs we demonstrate
8

here provide a practical and effective method to solve this problem by naturally eliminating the
downward radiative loss. Near unidirectional BICs, strong suppression of downward radiation is
achieved across a broad bandwidth: over 90% of the radiation energy is maintained towards the
top within a 26 nm bandwidth from 1536 to 1562 nm (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, we achieve robust
suppression of downward radiation at different out-coupling angles between 5◦ and 11◦ (Fig. 5b).
Finally, our design is found to have good tolerance to fabrication errors. See Supplementary Information Section VI and VII for details.

To summarize, we propose and demonstrate a type of resonances, named “unidirectional
BICs”, which only radiate towards a single side even though no mirror is placed on the other
side. From the viewpoint of topology, such resonances are induced by first splitting and then
merging two half-integer topological charges of polarization long axes. We fabricate PhC samples
on SOI wafers using a modified RIE process, and measure the upward and downward radiation
intensity directly. By showing the downward radiation vanishes, we demonstrate the existence of
unidirectional BICs, which are potentially useful for many applications including grating couplers,
photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers, and antennas for light detection and ranging.

continuum (BIC) is found on the TE1 band, marked with a red circle, at which point the quality
factor Qr diverges to infinity. b, Due to up-down symmetry, radiative losses from resonances

with red and green circles. d, As θ is further tuned to 75◦ , the two +1/2 charges bounce into each
other on the kx axis. At this point, the radiation loss towards the bottom is eliminated (γb = 0,

a “unidirectional BIC”. e, The trajectories traced by the two +1/2 topological charges (red and

Fig. 5 | Projected performance of unidirectional BICs as grating couplers. a, Asymmetry
ratio η between up- and downward radiation intensities for a fixed out-coupling angle of 9◦ . The
maximum reaches 27.7 dB near the unidirectional BIC and remains above 10 dB over a bandwidth
of 26 nm. b, Highly directional emission is observed over a wide range of excitation wavelengths
and for different out-coupling angles
