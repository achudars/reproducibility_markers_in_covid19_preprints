Abstract
We study infrared effects in perturbation theory for large-scale structure coupled to the
effective field theory of dark energy, focusing on, in particular, Degenerate Higher-Order ScalarTensor (DHOST) theories. In the subhorizon, Newtonian limit, DHOST theories introduce an
extra large-scale velocity vπi which is in general different from the matter velocity v i . Contrary
to the case in Horndeski theories, the presence of this extra large-scale velocity means that
one cannot eliminate the long-wavelength effects of both v i and vπi with a single coordinate
transformation, and thus the standard ΛCDM consistency relations for large-scale structure
are violated by terms proportional to the relative velocity v i − vπi . We show, however, that in
non-linear quantities this violation is determined by the linear equations and the symmetries of
the fluid system. We find that the size of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the squeezed limit of
the bispectrum is modified, that the bias expansion contains extra terms which contribute to the
squeezed limit of the galaxy bispectrum, that infrared modes in the one-loop power spectrum
no longer cancel, and that the equal-time double soft limit of the tree-level trispectrum is nonvanishing. We also show how one can resum the effects of one of the large-scale velocities on the
power spectrum, and how to include the relative velocity perturbatively in the resummation.
This result is also applicable to other theories with a large-scale relative velocity, such as dark
matter and baryons. Many of our computations are also relevant for perturbation theory in
ΛCDM with exact time dependence.

Introduction

Large-scale structure (LSS) surveys, which measure the positions and redshifts of galaxies to
provide a three-dimensional map of the galaxy density field, could very well be the next leading
sources of cosmological information. These surveys provide a rich picture of our cosmology. What
we see is the final state of the evolution of initial conditions, set by inflation, through the history of
the universe: from the radiation dominated early stages to the matter and cosmological-constant
dominated current era. In that time, perturbations in the curvature of space-time get imprinted
on the densities of the particle species present in the universe. The initial seeds of curvature
fluctuations imprint perturbations on, among other species, the cold dark-matter (CDM) density
field, whose evolution quickly becomes dominated by gravity. As the dark matter clumps, galaxies
tend to form in the regions of high density, so by measuring the properties of the distribution
of galaxies, we can learn about both the initial conditions of the universe and their subsequent
evolution. All of this has occurred in the background of an expanding universe, which has only
recently changed from being matter dominated to being dominated by the cosmological constant
Λ. This standard picture of the history of the universe is called ΛCDM.
Precisely connecting the galaxy-density map to fundamental cosmological information is no
small theoretical challenge, though. One must understand, at the percent level, non-linear darkmatter clustering, the effects of sub-dominant species like baryons and massive neutrinos, the nonlinear evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), redshift-space distortions, and galaxy
biasing. This tremendous task has been undertaken with standard techniques (see for example
[1–3] and references therein) but as improved surveys provide unprecedented, percent-level data, a
robust and theoretically controllable framework must be used (see for example [4–6] and references
therein). The latter framework, called the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFT of
LSS) [7, 8], was developed to provide a well-defined perturbative expansion of clustering statistics
to access short scale, mildly non-linear modes in galaxy surveys. Only after all of this is understood
can one can begin to probe new physics such as non-Gaussianity and dark energy. For the EFT
of LSS treatment of the above issues, see for example [7–19].
Complementing precision perturbation theory for LSS, we have another important tool for
understanding cosmological perturbations, namely the consistency relations for LSS in ΛCDM
[20–22], which relate soft (i.e. small momenta) limits of (n + 1)-point correlation functions to nor lower-point correlation functions (see [23] for an extension to multiple soft limits and redshift
space, and [24] for a verification of the consistency relations in N -body simulations). This kind of
consistency relation was first pointed out in the context of single-field inflation [25]. These relations
are generally non-perturbative and can be derived using a coordinate transformation and shift of
the fields [25, 26] based on the equivalence principle [22]. The form of the transformation in the
non-relativistic limit is that of a Galilean transformation, i.e. a boost into a frame with a given
velocity. By boosting to the frame comoving with the dark matter, one eliminates the effect of
the large-scale velocity (i.e. gradient of the metric): this is the basis of the consistency relations.
Crucial to this construction is that the velocities of all species can be eliminated in this way, i.e.
that there is a dominant adiabatic mode [27, 28].
In this paper, we study the effects of dark energy on the consistency relations for LSS, naturally
extending the work of [29] to the BAO, bias expansion, one-loop matter power spectrum, and treelevel trispectrum. The presence of dark energy (a light scalar field π), can violate the consistency
relations by introducing a second large-scale velocity, vπi ∝ ∂i π, in addition to the matter velocity
v i . As long as the relative velocity v i − vπi 6= 0, one cannot eliminate both long-wavelength velocity
3

fields with a single Galilean transformation. Thus we expect (and indeed confirm), that the
consistency relations will be violated by terms proportional to the relative velocity. To be precise,
by violation of the consistency relations, we simply mean that the standard ΛCDM consistency
relations are no longer true, because one cannot construct a physical adiabatic mode.
The situation here is similar to the case of multiple fluids, like CDM and baryons [30–32, 23, 12],
where the presence of a relative velocity also violates the consistency relations. In that case,
however, the relative velocity decays as a−1 (a is the scale factor of the metric, see eq. (1.1)), and
so is negligibly small at late times, but not necessarily so at early times [33]. The difference, though,
is that the dark-energy field π is not dynamical in the Newtonian limit (it is a constraint field like
the gravitational potential Φ), and so there are not really two fluids (see [34] for an example of a
dynamical dark energy, clustering quintessence, which preserves the consistency relations). What
happens is that the equations of motion, written in terms of only the dark-matter overdensity,
get modified by the π field to essentially contain two different convective derivatives. This means
that one cannot generally construct a physical adiabatic mode. Although the consistency relations
are violated, we find that the leading effects in the infrared (IR) can be determined by the linear
equations and the symmetries of the fluid system. This allows us to study the leading IR effects,
in particular those that violate the consistency relations, without having to solve the full equations
of motion. Because our results are determined by the symmetries in the IR, it would also be fair
to call them modified consistency relations.
In this work, we describe the dark-matter fluid by the overdensity δ ≡ (ρ − ρ̄)/ρ, where ρ is
the mass density of the fluid and ρ̄ is the time-dependent background value, and the velocity field
v i . The fluid moves under the forces of the Newtonian gravitational potential Φ, which appears in
the Newtonian gauge metric (considering only scalar perturbations),
ds2 = −(1 + 2Φ)dt2 + a(t)2 (1 − 2Ψ)d~x2 .

(1.1)

The fluid equations for the dark matter field are (valid in the non-relativistic, Newtonian limit
v/c  1 and ck/H  1, where k is the wavenumber),

δ̇ + a−1 ∂i (1 + δ)v i = 0 ,
(1.2)
v̇ i + Hv i + a−1 v j ∂j v i + a−1 ∂i Φ = −(aρ)−1 ∂j τ ij ,
where H = ȧ/a is the Hubble rate (a dot denotes a derivative with respect to t), and τ ij is the
stress tensor generated by short-scale non-linearities (i.e. counterterms) [7, 8]. In this work we set
the speed of light to unity c = 1, so that all velocities are measured with respect to c. To complete
the fluid equations eq. (1.2), one needs to relate the gravitational potential Φ to the dark-matter
density. In ΛCDM, this comes through the Poisson equation,

a−2 ∂ 2 Φ = H 2 Ωm δ ,

(1.3)

2 H 2 ) is the time-dependent matter fraction, and M
where Ωm = ρ̄/(3MPl
Pl is the Planck mass.
However, in theories with dark energy, this relationship is modified.
One way to study possible deviations from general relativity on cosmological scales is to consider
theories which break time diffeomorphisms. In order to avoid unstable Ostrogradsky modes [35],
it is common to focus on theories which propagate a single scalar degree of freedom. These include
Horndeski theories [36, 37], where the equations of motion are at most second order in the metric
and scalar field. This class of theories can be further extended to include equations of motion

4

with more than two derivatives, but which still propagate a single scalar mode. This class is
known as Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories [38–40], a subset of which
are the theories beyond Horndeski, such as Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV) theories [41]
(see also [42] for examples beyond Horndeski). In particular, in this work, we consider non-linear
DHOST theories within the EFT of dark energy [43, 44] (see [45] for the linear theory). Using
the ADM decomposition of the metric ds2 = −N 2 dt2 + hij (dxi + N i dt)(dxj + N j dt), and choosing
time to coincide with the uniform scalar-field hypersurfaces, this is given by
Z
√ M2 

+ (1 + αH ) RδN + 4β1 δKV + β2 V + β3 ai a + αV δN δK2 ,
where we have only included operators with the highest number of spatial derivatives, which are
the dominant terms in the Newtonian limit. Here δN ≡ N −1, δKij ≡ Kij −Hδij is the perturbation
of the extrinsic curvature of the time hypersurfaces, δK its trace, and (3)R is the 3D Ricci scalar
of these hypersurfaces. Moreover, δK2 ≡ δK 2 − δKij δKji , V ≡ (Ṅ − N i ∂i N )/N , and ai ≡ ∂i N/N .
In the action eq. (1.4), Horndeski theories have αH = β1 = β2 = β3 = 0, in which case
there are four free time-dependent functions: αK , αB , c2T and αM ≡ d log M 2 /d log a [46]. In the
Newtonian limit, the function αK only appears in the expression for the speed of sound of the
scalar field. Beyond Horndeski theories have αH 6= 0, and DHOST theories have β1 6= 0, while
the functions
conditions [45] β2 = −6β12 ,
 β2 and β3 are2 given in terms of β1 by the degeneracy

β3 = −2β1 2(1 + αH ) + β1 cT , which we will always impose. Furthermore, for simplicity, for the
rest of this work we will assume that c2T = 1. For the same reason, we have left off some cubic
operators in the action eq. (1.4) which would generically renormalize c2T and push it away from
unity (see for example [48]). We also assume that matter is minimally coupled to the gravitational
metric gµν , i.e.
Z
Sm = −

d3 x dt a3 ρ̄ (1 + δ)Φ

(1.5)

in the Newtonian limit, and that all species couple universally.
The action eq. (1.4) is in the unitary gauge, so the new scalar field is contained in the metric
(there is an extra scalar degree of freedom in the metric because the action breaks time diffeomorphisms). One can then explicitly introduce the scalar mode by using the Stückelberg trick
(essentially by performing a time diffeomorphism t → t + π(~x, t), exactly as in the EFT of inflation
[62]). After this, the action eq. (1.4) depends on the three fields Φ, Ψ, and π. After canonically
normalizing the π field, one can see that the unitarity cutoff for the π interactions in eq. (1.4), for
O(1) dimensionless couplings, is around Λ3 ∼ (MPl H02 )1/3 ≈ 1/(1000 km), where H0 is the Hubble
rate today. This means that the scales relevant for LSS are well within the EFT description of
dark energy.

Many of the parameters of these theories are constrained by observations. The measurement of the relative
light and gravitational-wave speeds [47] places significant constraints [48–51]. The breaking of Vainshtein screening
inside of astrophysical sources [52] places further constraints [53, 54, 43] (see [55] for a recent improvement). More
constraints can be placed by suppressing gravitational-wave decay into dark energy [56, 57] (which forces αH = −2β1 )
and instabilities induced by gravitational waves [58]. Vainshtein screening for theories evading the above constraints
was studied in [59, 44]. Finally, theoretical arguments using positivity have dramatically reduced the cutoff for some
EFTs of scalars coupled to gravity [60], for example the cubic galileon [61]. If this is the case, then constraints from
LSS, which would be within the regime of validity of the EFT, may be more relevant than constraints coming from
smaller scales, as in Vainshtein screening, which may be outside of the regime of validity of the EFT.

5

In the Newtonian limit that we consider in this paper, time derivatives of the gravitational
fields Φ, Ψ, and π, which are of order the Hubble scale H, are suppressed with respect to spatial
derivatives, so the equations of motion become constraint equations. By solving the constraint
equations for these fields and perturbatively including the coupling to matter, we obtain a modified
Poisson equation of the form
a−2 ∂ 2 Φ = N [δ] ,
(1.6)
where N is some non-linear functional of the matter density that depends on the EFT action
eq. (1.4). This completes the system of equations for δ, which we can then solve perturbatively.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, we review perturbation theory in ΛCDM.
In Sec. 3 we review the standard consistency relations in ΛCDM and also show how they can
be proven in perturbation theory with exact time dependence (i.e. using the Green’s function).
In Sec. 4 we present the gravitational field equations for DHOST theories, discuss their leading
IR properties, and solve for the leading IR contributions to the second and third order matter
overdensity. Contrary to the case in Horndeski theories, we find that the leading IR solutions
in DHOST theories deviate from the standard ΛCDM solutions. In Sec. 5, we discuss how these
solutions violate the consistency relations, in particular focusing on the BAO oscillations in the
squeezed limit of the bispectrum, the bias expansion, the one-loop power spectrum, and the treelevel trispectrum. Furthermore, we discuss the IR-resummation, which is necessary to correctly
describe the BAO in correlation functions, in this context. We show that one can resum the effects
of one of the large-scale velocities, but that the effect of the relative velocity must be treated
perturbatively. Our results are also applicable to correctly performing the IR-resummation with
multiple fluids, such as with dark matter and baryons. In Sec. 6, we conclude. We have reserved
the Appendix for additional details and discussion: in App. A we present the background wave
argument proof of the standard consistency relations, in App. B we provide details of the Green’s
function manipulations used in the main text, in App. C we provide the relationships between the
coefficients in the dark-energy action eq. (1.4) and the equations of motion, and in App. D we give
details related to the IR-resummation with a large-scale relative velocity.
We use Latin indices like i, j, k, . . . to denote spatial components, and we do not distinguish
P3
between upper and lower spatial indices. We denote the spatial laplacian by ∂ 2 ≡
i=1 ∂i ∂i ,
and use the three-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol εijk , normalized so that ε123 = 1, and with no
factors of the metric. For numerical computations, we use the ΛCDM cosmological parameters
Ωm,0 = 0.281, Ωb,0 = 0.046, h = 0.697, ∆ζ 2 = 2.37 × 10−9 , and ns = 0.971.

Perturbation theory in ΛCDM

The dark-matter fluid system is roughly linear on large scales and becomes non-linear on smaller
scales. Thus, it is common to solve the dark-matter system perturbatively. To do that, one expands
the overdensity like
δ = δ (1) + δ (2) + δ (3) + . . . ,
(2.1)
where δ (1) solves the linear equations of motion, and δ (n) ∼ [δ (1) ]n are iterative non-linear corrections. In particular, we assume the growing mode solution

In terms of two linearly independent solutions D+ and D− of eq. (2.3), the retarded Green’s function, which
satisfies the boundary conditions G(t1 , t1 ) = 0 and ∂t G(t, t1 )|t=t1 + = 1 as  → 0+ , is explicitly given by
G(t, t1 ) = W (t1 )−1 (D− (t)D+ (t1 ) − D+ (t)D− (t1 )) ΘH (t − t1 ) ,

(2.8)

where ΘH is the Heaviside step function and the Wronskian is given by
W (t) = D+ (t)Ḋ− (t) − D− (t)Ḋ+ (t) .

We will often use the notation Ḡ(t, t1 ) ≡ W (t1 ) (D− (t)D+ (t1 ) − D+ (t)D− (t1 )) to refer to the part of the Green’s

As we will discuss later, the coefficient in front of αs is fixed to be Aα (t) = 1 by the IR
symmetries of the fluid system, which means that the integral over the Green’s function in eq. (2.18)
must non-trivially simplify. The reason that this term is special is because it is the dominant term
in F2 when either k1 → 0 or k2 → 0, i.e. in the IR limit. We will have much more to say about
this in the coming sections. The coefficient Aγ , on the other hand, is not fixed by any symmetries,
and its value is not restricted in ΛCDM. In the EdS cosmology (i.e. with Ωm (t) = 1), we have
AEdS
γ (t) = −2/7, while for the cosmology given in the Introduction, we have Aγ (t0 ) = −0.284,
where t0 is the current time.
Generally, we are interested in the statistics of the density field in Fourier space, the most
relevant of which, for this work, are the power spectrum P , the bispectrum B, and the trispectrum
T . These are defined by the correlation functions
hδ~k1 (t1 )δ~k2 (t2 )i = (2π)3 δD (~k1 + ~k2 )P (k1 ; t1 , t2 ) ,

Translation invariance forces the delta-function structure on the right-hand side of the these expressions. Rotation invariance makes the power spectrum P (k1 ) a function of only the magnitude
k1 , and in general eliminates three parameters in the dependence of higher point statistics. For
example, it is customary to describe the bispectrum by either the three magnitudes (k1 , k2 , k3 ), or
by two magnitudes and a dot product (k1 , k2 , k̂1 · k̂2 ). However, for the purposes of this work, we
choose to write the functional dependence of the statistics as in eq. (2.20).

where the prime on a correlation function means that we strip off the (2π)3 and Dirac delta

corrections, called loop corrections, to the linear power spectrum P11 . Assuming Gaussian initial
conditions, which we assume throughout this work, the expression for the power spectrum up to
one loop is

Consistency relations for dark matter in ΛCDM

As a setup for our main discussion, we review the arguments leading to the standard consistency
relations for dark matter in ΛCDM. In this work, we are interested in correlations of the darkmatter overdensity, so we focus on the implications of the consistency relations for these objects
below.

3.1

Review of non-perturbative statements

The consistency relations are a set of non-perturbative relationships between soft limits of (n +
1)-point correlation functions and n- or lower-point correlation functions. They are a result of
residual large gauge symmetries7 in the Newtonian gauge. The Newtonian-gauge metric eq. (1.1)
is invariant under spatial dilations and special conformal transformations [64–66, 22, 28]. These
symmetries are relevant for a full relativistic treatment, but in large-scale structure, we deal mostly
with the non-relativistic, Newtonian limit, where velocities are much smaller than the speed of light,
and typical wavenumbers k are much larger than the Hubble scale. Then, in the Newtonian limit
one is left with two relevant symmetries for the fluid system eq. (1.2).
The first (which comes from the dilation symmetry) is a shift of the gravitational potential by
a time-dependent function,
Φ(~x, t) → Φ(~x, t) + cΦ (t) ,
(3.1)
which is unaccompanied by a coordinate change. This symmetry implies the consistency relation
[28]
lim q 2

hδq~(τ ) δ~k1 (t1 ) · · · δ~kn (tn )i0

q→0

P11 (q; τ )

=0,

(3.2)

where here and elsewhere τ is a time coordinate, but we use a different symbol because it is related
to the soft mode. The second symmetry (which comes from the special conformal symmetry) is a
combination of a time-dependent coordinate change and shifts of the fields:
x̃i = xi + ni (t) ,

t̃ = t ,

ṽ i (x̃j , t) = v i (xj , t) + aṅi (t) ,

Φ̃(x̃j , t) = Φ(xj , t) − a2 (n̈i (t) + 2H ṅi (t))x̃i ,

δ̃(x̃j , t) = δ(xj , t) ,

(3.3)

for generic ni (t). Equivalently, the transformation eq. (3.3) acts directly on the equations of motion
eq. (1.2) by making the replacements
∂i → ∂i ,

∂t → ∂t − ṅi (t)∂i ,

v i (xj , t) → v i (xj , t) + aṅi (t) ,

Φ(xj , t) → Φ(xj , t) − a2 (n̈i (t) + 2H ṅi (t))xi ,

δ(xj , t) → δ(xj , t) .

(3.4)

Although the above is a symmetry for any ni (t), it will generate a physical solution if the time
dependence of the transformation matches the time dependence of the q → 0 limit of a physical
solution [27]. This amounts to ni (t) solving the linear equation for D+ (t), i.e. [22, 28, 67, 68]
n̈i + 2H ṅi −

Large gauge transformations are those that do not vanish at spatial infinity.

Thus, we see that, as q → 0, terms that grow like O(k/q)2 (in this work, ~ki is always a short
mode, and ~qj is always a soft mode), or faster are in general not allowed, and that for equal-time
correlators, terms that grow like O(k/q) or faster are not allowed.
Similar kinds of arguments can be used to derive consistency relations when multiple external
momenta are taken to be soft [23, 69]. For example, the double soft-limit consistency relation
reads,

Finally, the same arguments can tell us about loop corrections when the loop momentum is in
the deep IR. We have [23] (see also [70, 71, 31, 32, 72, 10]),

By expanding the exponential to N -th order, we find the effect of N soft loops on the correlation
function.
We would like to stress that these relationships are non-perturbative, and in fact have an even
broader applicability than for only the dark-matter density. We present a derivation of these
results using the background wave argument in App. A. Strictly speaking, these results are only
correct when q is taken much smaller than all energy scales in the linear power spectrum, of which
the most relevant in our universe is the BAO scale [73, 74]. In the correlation function,8 the
BAO show up as a peak near `BAO ≈ 110 h−1 Mpc of width σ ≈ 10 h−1 Mpc (this means that in
the power spectrum, there is an oscillatory feature with frequency ∆kosc ∼ 2π`−1
BAO and support
∆kwidth ∼ 1/σ, see Fig. 3). Thus, the consistency relations are valid for q  2π`−1
BAO . We discuss
this further in Sec. 5.1.

3.2

Perturbative argument for the IR with exact time dependence

In this section, we show how to derive the above relations in perturbation theory, since this method
will ultimately be used later when we study DHOST theories. Additionally, we work with the full
Green’s function to compute the time dependence of the fields, as opposed to the commonly

employed EdS approximation, since this approach will be relevant for our later discussion. As we
will see, our approach will not depend on the solution δ (1) being a growing mode.
We would like to solve eq. (1.2) for δ (n) at leading order for q/k → 0. To proceed, we could
simply iteratively solve eq. (1.2) as normal, and then take the IR limit. However, we can use our
knowledge of the symmetries of the system to simplify the job (again, this point of view will be
more helpful later).
First, we notice that invariance of the equations of motion under eq. (3.4) implies a relationship
between terms with time derivatives and certain non-linear terms involving the velocity. For
example, a time derivative on δ must occur in the combination, commonly known as the convective
derivative,
δ̇ + a−1 v i ∂i δ ,
(3.10)
to be invariant. The same goes for two derivatives on δ, which must occur in the combination
δ̈ + a−1 (v̇ i ∂i δ + 2v i ∂i δ̇ − Hv i ∂i δ) + a−2 v i v j ∂i ∂j δ .

(3.11)

These are the leading IR terms that appear in the equation of motion. This can be seen because
they have no spatial derivatives on the velocity (which is necessary because of the symmetry
eq. (3.4)), and the long-wavelength velocity eq. (2.4) is the only object in the equations of motion
that can introduce inverse powers of q. This means that we can directly write the leading IR
contributions to the equation of motion as
δ̈ + 2H δ̇ − a−2 ∂ 2 Φ ≈ −a−1 (v̇ i ∂i δ + 2v i ∂i δ̇ + Hv i ∂i δ) − a−2 v i v j ∂i ∂j δ ,

(3.12)

where here and in the rest of this work, the symbol ≈ means that the relationship is valid to
leading order as q/k → 0. We have shown, given the left-hand side of eq. (3.12), that the terms
on the right-hand side must be present in order for the equation to be Galilean invariant. But are
these the only terms allowed? We could imagine adding other Galilean invariant non-linear terms,
such as δ(δ̇ + a−1 v i ∂i δ), to the right-hand side. However, one can quickly see that these will be
sub-dominant in the IR limit because they do not have enough powers of v i . Thus, the form of
eq. (3.12) in the IR limit is in this sense unique.
This equation can then be solved directly using the Green’s function eq. (2.8), which gives the
formal solution

for q1,2  k. Notice, crucially, that the Green’s function from eq. (3.13) has dropped out of the
solution eq. (3.14). The way that this happens is quite non-trivial, so we present the proof in
App. B.
The form of the solution eq. (3.14) is not an accident, and in fact could have been derived in
a much more straightforward way, avoiding the Green’s function altogether. The invariance of the
equations of motion under eq. (3.3) for a time-dependent ni (t) tells us that if we give ni (t) a weak
spatial dependence, the solution for δ, at the lowest order in derivatives, is given by a coordinate
transformation. Promoting ni (t) → niL (~x, t) (here and elsewhere the subscript L is to remind us
that the function is a long-wavelength field), we choose
i
(~x, t) .
aṅiL (~x, t) = −v(1)

(3.17)

Then, by construction, the equation of motion for δ̃ in the tilde coordinates does not contain the
leading IR non-linear terms, i.e. the terms on the right-hand side of eq. (3.12), and so δ̃ satisfies
the linear equations to leading order in the IR. Taking the field in the tilde coordinates to be the
linear solution δ̃(x̃i , t) = δ (1) (x̃i , t), we have, to leading order in derivatives,
δ(~x, t) ≈ δ (1) (~x + ~nL (~x, t), t) .

Expanding the exponential that contains δq~ then gives the solution eq. (3.14), which we refer
to as the standard ΛCDM solution. This derivation makes it clear that the Green’s function in
eq. (3.13) has to cancel, which we show explicitly in App. B. This form of the leading IR solution
is the basis of the consistency relations.

Gravitational equations and linear solutions

To find the equations in the gravitational sector for DHOST, we expand the action eq. (1.4) in
terms of the metric and scalar field perturbations π and keep only terms with the highest number
13

of derivatives per field, which are those relevant in the Newtonian limit. After doing that and
varying the action with respect to the fields, we obtain [43–45],

and C1 , . . . , C4 , c1 , . . . , c9 , and b1 , b2 , b3 are time-dependent coefficients that depend on the parameters of the action, reported in App. C.1. Although we focus on the leading IR terms in the coming
sections, we have presented the full equations of motion above for completeness.9
We seek a perturbative solution to eqs. (4.1 - 4.3) in powers of δ. Thus, we will expand the
fields ϕa as

ϕa = ϕ(1)

where each perturbative piece is proportional to the relevant number of powers of δ (1) , i.e. ϕa ∼
[δ (1) ]n . In this work, we will solve up to third order, and we start with the linear solutions.
As discussed in [44] (see also [76–78, 59]), the linear solutions have the following form
(1)
a−2 ∂ 2 ϕ(1)
+ νϕa δ̇ (1) + σϕa δ̈ (1) .
a = µϕa δ

(4.7)

We have supplied the expressions for the time dependent µϕa , νϕa , and σϕa functions in terms of
the parameters in the field equations in App. C.2, but we note, however, that
σπ = 0 .

(4.8)

2 ) = 3Ω H 2 /2.
Horndeski theories have σϕa = νϕa = 0, and ΛCDM has µΦ = µΨ = ρ̄/(2MPl
m
Combining eq. (4.7) with the fluid equations eq. (1.2), we have the linear evolution equation
for δ (1) ,
δ̈ (1) + ν̄Φ δ̇ (1) − µ̄Φ δ (1) = 0 ,
(4.9)

While we focus on the IR structure of the above equations, we note that [75] found that the UV contribution
from loops does not satisfy momentum conservation.

The linear equation eq. (4.9) has two solutions, one growing, D+ (t), and one decaying, D− (t).
We focus on the growing mode solution so we write the solution for δ (1) as eq. (2.2). Looking at
eq. (1.2), this means that the linear solution for the velocity can be written as in eq. (2.4).
Once we have the linear solution D+ , this allows us to write the linear solutions eq. (4.7) as

Symmetries and leading IR terms

To start, we note that the constant shift symmetry eq. (3.1) and associated consistency relation
eq. (3.2) remain in the DHOST system. The symmetry under Φ(~x, t) → Φ(~x, t) + cΦ (t) means that
the correlation of short modes δ~kn in the background of a long wavelength ΦL does not depend on
the value of ΦL , i.e.
(4.13)
hδ~k1 · · · δ~kn iΦL = hδ~k1 · · · δ~kn iΦL +cΦ .
In particular, we can expand the dependence of the correlation function on derivatives of ΦL as
(for q  ki ),
Z δhδ · · · δ i

where the term proportional to the derivative with respect to Φq~ is absent because of eq. (4.13).
Assuming that there is a well defined derivative expansion of hδ~k1 · · · δ~kn iΦL with respect to ΦL ,
the functional derivative shown above is finite. Then, taking the correlation with another long
wavelength Φq~, we find

which confirms that eq. (3.2) is valid in DHOST theories.
Next, we consider the Galilean transformations. The equations in the gravitational sector
eqs. (4.1 - 4.3) are invariant under the following coordinate change and shifts of the fields:
x̃i = xi + ξ i (t) ,

t̃ = t ,

δ̃(x̃j , t̃) = δ(xj , t) ,

10

ϕ̃a (x̃j , t̃) = ϕa (xj , t) + biϕa (t)x̃i .

Note that the functional derivative δhδ~k1 · · · δ~kn iΦL /δ(q i Φq~ )|0 is proportional to δD (
functions work out in eq. (4.15).

ϕa (xj , t) → ϕa (xj , t) + biϕa (t)xi ,

δ(xj , t) → δ(xj , t) . (4.18)

In Horndeski theories, which have αH = β1 = 0, this transformation is a symmetry for arbitrary
functions ξ i (t), biΦ (t), biΨ (t), and biπ (t), as can be easily verified, since we have c6 = c7 = c8 = c9 =
C4 = 0 and all fields have at least two spatial derivatives in eqs. (4.1 - 4.3).
In DHOST theories, on the other hand, when αH 6= 0 or β1 6= 0, the equations eqs. (4.1 - 4.3)
are only invariant under eq. (4.17) if
biπ (t) = −a2 ξ˙i (t) ,

i.e. if the transformation of π is fixed by the coordinate transformation. This is because the equations contain terms with time derivatives and less than two spatial derivatives. Under eq. (4.18), a
time derivative of a field generates a term involving that field and ξ˙i , which can only be canceled
by a higher order term involving ∂i π if eq. (4.19) holds.
As discussed in [29], when combined with the fluid equations eq. (1.2), the system has an overall
Galilean invariance, i.e. when setting ξ i (t) = ni (t), and biΦ (t) = −a2 (n̈i (t) + 2H ṅi (t)). Defining
the scalar field velocity
vπi ≡ −a−1 ∂i π ,
(4.20)
we see that the transformations of v i and vπi are the same under this transformation. This means
that the relative velocity, defined by
∆v i ≡ v i − vπi ,
(4.21)
is invariant under the Galilean transformation, which in turn means that we cannot use the Galilean
transformation to eliminate the effect of the long-wavelength relative velocity, i.e. we cannot construct a physical adiabatic mode. Thus, the consistency relations are violated by terms proportional
to the relative velocity. Incidentally, this means that DHOST theories that have ∆v i = 0 do not
violate the consistency relations (see eq. (4.35) for the explicit condition). In Horndeski theories,
on the other hand, biπ (t) is not fixed to be related to the transformation of v i , and so one can
construct the physical adiabatic mode, and therefore the consistency relations are satisfied [29]
(see also [15] for a proof that the one-loop power spectrum is IR safe).
Although the consistency relations are generically violated in DHOST theories, we can use the
symmetries eq. (3.4) and eq. (4.18) to compute this violation in terms of the parameters in the
linear equations of motion, and explicitly show how they are proportional to the relative velocity
∆v i .
In particular, the symmetry eq. (4.17) means that in the solution to eqs. (4.1 - 4.3), i.e. for
the scalar potentials Φ, Ψ, and π in terms of the overdensity δ, time derivatives of fields must be
accompanied by non-linear terms containing the velocity vπi . For example, a time derivative on δ
must occur in the combination
δ̇ + a−1 vπi ∂i δ
(4.22)
to be invariant. The same goes for two derivatives on δ, which must occur in the combination
δ̈ + a−1 (v̇πi ∂i δ + 2vπi ∂i δ̇ − Hvπi ∂i δ) + a−2 vπi vπj ∂i ∂j δ .

We stress here that we did not have to solve the full non-linear equations: along with the linear
equations, the symmetry eq. (4.17) determines the leading non-linear expressions in the IR. In
the same way as discussed below eq. (3.12) for the fluid equations, the form of the IR solution
eq. (4.25) is unique in the sense that, given the linear part of the solution in eq. (4.24), eq. (4.25)
gives the unique non-linear extension which is invariant under eq. (4.17).

4.3

Perturbative solutions in the IR

As discussed in [29], we can use the symmetries eq. (3.3) and eq. (4.17) to easily compute the
leading IR contributions to the perturbative solutions δ (2) and δ (3) . Plugging the IR expression
for ∂ 2 Φ from eq. (4.24) into the IR expression for the fluid from eq. (3.12), we have, after some
rearranging,


δ̈ + ν̄Φ δ̇ − µ̄Φ δ ≈ − a−1 2v i ∂i δ̇ + v̇ i ∂i δ − Hv i ∂i δ − a−2 v i v j ∂i ∂j δ − ν̄Φ a−1 v i ∂i δ

As discussed above, the IR non-linear extensions of the fluid equations eq. (3.12) and the gravitational fields eq. (4.25) are each unique, determined by the respective symmetries eq. (3.3) and
eq. (4.17). Thus, the final expression eq. (4.26) is unique given the way that the gravitational
potential ∂ 2 Φ enters eq. (3.12); if the coupling of the gravitational potentials to matter changes,
eq. (4.26) could change as well. That said, given our assumption of minimal coupling, eq. (4.26) is
the unique IR non-linear extension of the linear equations that preserves the symmetries eq. (3.3)
and eq. (4.17).
As we show in App. B, if we set ∆v i = 0, the solution to the above equation is eq. (B.15), which
is the same as the ΛCDM solution eq. (3.21). This makes sense, since when ∆v i = 0, the leading
IR solution is given simply by the coordinate transformation eq. (3.18). As we will show in Sec. 5,
the presence of the terms proportional to ∆v i in eq. (4.26) violates the consistency relations.
First, we find δ (2) , which solves

Applying the Green’s function, we see from App. B that the first line above gives the standard
ΛCDM contribution. The second line cannot be further simplified, so it gives a generic contribution
which is proportional to the linear relative velocity. Using eq. (4.20) and eq. (4.11), the linear

background evolution has been chosen to be the one of ΛCDM, i.e. the Hubble rate is given
by H(a) = H0 a−3 Ωm,0 + 1 − Ωm,0 , the matter evolution is given by Ωm (a) = Ωm,0 /(Ωm,0 + a3 (1 − Ωm,0 )),
and we have taken Ωm,0 = 0.281 as the current value of the fractional matter density. (In the numerical
calculation, the Hubble rate always appears in the combination H/H0 so that the curves are independent
of the value of H0 .) We parametrize the time dependence of the EFT of dark energy parameters as
αB (a) = ᾱB (1 − Ωm (a)) and β1 (a) = β̄1 (1 − Ωm (a)), where ᾱB and β̄1 are constants. The other EFT
parameters, for simplicity, are chosen such that the model leaves the gravitational wave speed, amplitude,
and decay unaffected (see e.g. [44] for a discussion), i.e. αT = αM = 0 and αH = −2β1 . Moreover, we only
plot values of ᾱB and β̄1 for which αc2s > 0, as required by the absence of ghost and gradient instability
(see e.g. [79]).

and ∆Aα ≡ Aα − 1. This is the most straightforward way to obtain the solution, but as we show
later in Sec. 5.3, the result can be further simplified by first changing coordinates in the equation
of motion. We show various functions related to the violation of the consistency relations in Fig. 2.
We would like to stress here how, after knowing the manipulation of the Green’s function which
gives the standard ΛCDM result, we are able to easily determine the solutions in the IR without
going through the full equations of motion. As a final note, we point out that a subset of DHOST
theories, those with L∆v = 0, i.e.
Hf − µπ − Hf νπ = 0 ,

(4.35)

do not violate the consistency relations. However, it appears quite difficult to satisfy this condition,
since it would mean that the DHOST parameters are functionally dependent on the background
evolution Ωm (t) and the linear growth rate f .

Bispectrum

We first look at the squeezed limit of the equal-time matter bispectrum. Using eq. (4.29), we have

~q · (~k + ~k1 )
≈ −Aα
P11 (k) ,
q→0
P11 (q)

lim

(5.1)

which starts at O((k/q)0 ) because ~k + ~k1 = −~q. Therefore, there is no k/q enhancement of the
full bispectrum in the squeezed limit q `BAO  1. However, the vanishing of the right-hand side
of eq. (5.1) is not a consequence of the consistency relations but simply of the symmetry of the
bispectrum under exchange of the two arguments ~k and ~k1 (and translation invariance, i.e. that
~k + ~k1 + ~q = 0). As discussed in [29], though, there will generically be an enhancement in the
squeezed limit of the bispectrum of different species (for example, different types of galaxies).
In order to find an effect in the bispectrum of all the same species, we have to go to the next
order in q/k. Using eq. (4.29) and expanding to the next order, we find,
Bt (~q, ~k − ~q/2, −~k − ~q/2)
~q · ~k ~q · ~k ∂P11 (k)
≈ 0 − Aα 2

(5.2)

The zero above comes from eq. (5.1), which is valid at O(k/q). The next term shown is naively of
order (k/q)0 , and so would be of the same order as other terms that have been neglected. However,
if the term shown in eq. (5.2) is large compared to the neglected terms for other reasons, it can
dominate, giving again a contribution which is computable using only IR properties (i.e. depends
only on Aα ). This is precisely what happens in the presence of the BAO, where the term shown
in eq. (5.2) can be the dominant contribution to the oscillatory part of the bispectrum (see for
example [74] for a discussion in ΛCDM). In Fig. 3, we show the BAO feature for linear theory.
20

To see how the term in eq. (5.2) can be the dominant contribution to oscillatory features,
it is useful to consider computing the smooth part of the power spectrum separately from the
oscillatory part (see, for example, [74, 80]). To do that, we split the linear power spectrum into a
s and an oscillatory part P osc , as in Fig. 3,11
smooth part P11

see is osc ∼ 0.06. For the smooth part, which is approximately scale free, we have

and matching the first power of osc in eq. (5.2), we have

Now, because of eq. (5.5), the term that we have included in eq. (5.7) will dominate over the terms
that we have neglected if
k `BAO  1 ,
(5.8)
which is satisfied for typical wavenumbers of interest. In ΛCDM, we have Aα = 1, and so this
contribution to the oscillatory part of the bispectrum is universal, fixed by the equivalence principle.
However, we see that DHOST theories change this contribution.
In Fig. 4, we show how this term enters the bispectrum. We write the full bispectrum as in
[29],
Bt (~q, ~k1 , ~k2 ) = 2F2 (~q, ~k1 )P11 (q)P11 (k1 ) + 2 perms. ,
(5.9)
where
F2 (~q, ~k) = Aα αs (~q, ~k) + Aγ γ(~q, ~k) .

(5.10)

To describe the deviations from ΛCDM, we write
Aα = 1 + ∆Aα ,

and Aγ = AΛCDM
+ ∆Aγ ,
γ

(5.11)

where for the cosmology used in this paper, we have AΛCDM
= −0.284.
γ
In Fig. 4, we plot the full bispectrum eq. (5.9) and the dominant oscillatory part eq. (5.7)
for various choices of ∆Aα and ∆Aγ . We see that the oscillatory parts of the full bispectra all
approach the dominant oscillatory contribution eq. (5.7) for k/q  1, and that this limit depends
on Aα , but not Aγ . Thus, the measurement of a different size of the oscillations in the squeezed
limit would be a clear signal for the violation of the consistency relations, which could have its
origin in DHOST theories with Aα 6= 1. Of course, to actually measure this effect, one needs to
compute the galaxy or halo bispectrum, which we turn to next.
11

In this work, we ignore any ambiguity in splitting the linear power spectrum (see for example [81]).

21

Figure 4: We plot various bispectra in the configuration (~q, ~k − ~q/2, −~k − ~q/2) for q = 0.01 h Mpc−1 and
q̂· k̂ = 0.9, for various values of ∆Aα and ∆Aγ . Solid lines are the full bispectrum eq. (5.9), while dashed lines
are the dominant oscillatory contributions eq. (5.7). We have also plotted the associated smooth bispectra
with thin lines. In the bottom panel, we plot the residual osc Btosc = Bt − Bts . In the bottom panel, we see
that there are two different limiting behaviors, the purple and grey dashed lines, corresponding to Aα = 0
and Aα = 0.5 respectively. The red and blue solid curves have different values of Aγ , but they have the
same limiting behavior (the purple dashed line) because they have the same value of Aα . In all cases, the
full bispectra approach the correct limiting behavior eq. (5.7) for k/q  1. We note that the large value of
∆Aγ needed to produce a visible difference between the red and blue curves in the plot is due to the fact
that the contribution is proportional to Aγ (1 − (q̂ · k̂)2 ), and we have chosen q̂ · k̂ = 0.9 so that eq. (5.7)
would be the dominant contribution.

5.2

Bias expansion

In this section, we are interested in the bias expansion relevant for computing the galaxy bispectrum, so we consider terms up to second order. Following [82], we write the overdensity of galaxies
(or any other tracer) δ g as a derivative expansion of the underlying dark-matter field. Since δ g is
a scalar under the overall Galilean transformation (i.e. eq. (3.3) and eq. (4.17) with ξ i = ni and
biΦ = −a2 (n̈i + 2H ṅi )), we write the bias expansion in terms of Galilean scalars. As discussed, ∆v i
is a scalar, and so it should be included in the bias expansion. This means that the new terms that
can be added are proportional to, at first order, ∂i ∆v i , and at second order, ∆v i ∂i δ, δ∂i ∆v i , and
∆v i ∆v i . However, the terms containing ∂i ∆v i are already allowed in the ΛCDM bias expansion,
so they do not provide new terms here. Thus, we have, up to second order,
δ g = bg,1 δ + bg,2 δ 2 + bg,3

where all fields above are evaluated at the same coordinates (~x, t), and the bg,i are time-dependent
dimensionless coefficients.12 Since the new terms must vanish in Horndeski, we must have that

For the sake of brevity, we are ignoring the stochastic bias and subtleties related to non-locality in time [16].
Similar terms regarding the relative velocity have appeared in the context of baryons (see for example [83]).

22

bg,4 = 0 and bg,5 = 0 when νΦ = σΦ = 0.
Relative to the size of the other contributions, we expect the (∆v)2 term to be a relativistic
correction, since in momentum space it scales as an extra factor of H 2 /k 2 with respect to, for
example, the δ 2 term. In any case, we are interested in the squeezed limit, and the new term
which is relevant in that regime is the one proportional to bg,5 , which is absent in ΛCDM. As
mentioned above, if we correlate different tracers, there can be an enhanced effect in the squeezed
limit of the bispectrum, proportional to the difference in the bias coefficients. For this discussion,
though, we are interested in the signal in the bispectrum of a single tracer. Following the discussion
in the previous section, there will be no enhancement in the broadband of the bispectrum, so we
will look at the BAO. Defining

In theories that satisfy the consistency relations, we have Agα = 1/bg,1 , and so measuring the
size of the oscillations in the squeezed limit, as in Fig. 4, is a direct measurement of the linear bias
bg,1 (see [84] for a confirmation in simulations). Unfortunately, this means that the contribution
to eq. (5.14) from DHOST appears degenerate with the linear bias, and that only a more thorough
analysis of multiple observables, so that one can independently determine bg,1 , will be able to
disentangle the DHOST contribution from the bias contribution. We leave this kind of study for
future work.

5.3

Power spectrum and trispectrum

The violation of the consistency relations also has consequences for the IR contribution to the
one-loop power spectrum. Using eq. (4.29) and eq. (4.32) in eq. (2.23), we have,

This contribution is absent in ΛCDM due to the equivalence principle [70, 71, 20, 10], but is present
here in DHOST because of the non-zero large-scale relative velocity.13
To see how this new term affects perturbation theory, we first introduce the expansion parameters of the Eulerian loop expansion. These are given by [73, 74, 85],

We note that, for late-time dark-energy models (which is what we are mostly concerned with in this paper), the
linear power spectrum goes as P11 (q) ∼ q ns in the IR, where ns ≈ 0.971 is the tilt of the primordial power spectrum.
This ensures that the integral in eq. (5.16) is convergent, and that perturbation theory can be well-defined.

to s< cancel between P22 and P13 because of the equivalence principle, and so the Eulerian
expansion is in powers of δ< , which is indeed much smaller on the scales of interest.14 Thus,
the presence of eq. (5.18) can affect the validity of the perturbative expansion, which can now be
controlled by the IR displacements.
In order to describe the new terms in the loop expansion, we introduce two expansion parameters. The first are the DHOST parameters νΦ /H and σΦ , which are both proportional to αH or β1 .
When these parameters are non-zero, we have terms in the gravitational field equations eqs. (4.1 4.3) that have one and three spatial derivatives, which is the hallmark of DHOST theories. In what
follows, in order to count the order of perturbations, we use λD to stand for νΦ /H and σΦ . The
other expansion parameter, which we denote as λ∆v , is the relative velocity, i.e. λ∆v ∼ L∆v /H.
The violation of the consistency relations is proportional to both of these parameters, so that both
have to be non-zero in order to have an effect. This makes sense, since even in Horndeski theories
we generically have λ∆v 6= 0, but there is no violation of the consistency relations because λD = 0.
On the other hand, we can have DHOST theories, λD 6= 0, that do not violate the consistency
relations if λ∆v = 0, see eq. (4.35).
As written in eq. (4.30), eq. (4.33), and eq. (4.34), it appears that A2α − Bα ∼ O(λD λ∆v ) (we
will momentarily show that this is in fact not true, but it is instructional to consider for now),
since ∆Aα and ∆Bα ≡ Bα − 1 contain terms linear in λD λ∆v . This appears to be the case because,
for example, one can insert a ΛCDM solution into a vertex proportional to ∆v i in eq. (4.26), so
14

The large IR displacements do, however, have an effect on the computation of the BAO, which we describe in
more detail in Sec. 5.4. In order to correctly describe the BAO in perturbation theory one must resum the effects of
the long-wavelength displacements (see for example [73, 86, 18, 87, 81, 74, 88, 80, 89–91]). Being an IR effect, this
does not change the broadband convergence properties of the perturbative expansion.

that the whole vertex is only proportional to one power of λ∆v . Continuing in this way to higher
loops, one would obtain
PNIR-loop (k) ∼ P11 (k) λD λ∆v s< (k)N .
(5.19)
This should to be contrasted with the situation in ΛCDM, where the higher order corrections are,
roughly,
N
PNΛCDM
(5.20)
-loop (k) ∼ P11 (k) δ< (k) .
It is important to note that the corrections in eq. (5.19) are generically proportional to λ∆v , and
not λN
∆v , so that it really is s< that controls the expansion, and not λ∆v s< . What this means is
that even if λ∆v s< (k)  1, corrections higher than one loop will contribute powers of s< (k), and
so one must be in a regime where s< (k) . 1 for the perturbative series to be sensible. Looking
at Fig. 5, this would mean that we would only be able to trust our perturbative calculations well
below k ≈ 0.1 h Mpc−1 .
Luckily, this is not the case, and we will show that in general, for small λD ,

(5.21)
To see this, we will solve eq. (4.26) in a more illuminating way, by first changing coordinates to
the frame comoving with the dark matter, perturbatively solving the equations in that frame, and
then changing coordinates back. Consider the coordinate transformation (note that we are not
also shifting the fields),
x̃i = xi + niL (~x, t) ,

δ(xi , t) = δ̃(x̃i , t)

i
and ṅiL (~x, t) = −a−1 v(1)

To find the expression at leading order in k/q, we can expand ei~q·~xb ≈ 1 + i~q · ~xb + . . . inside of the
exponential, and then expand the exponential itself. At each order in δ, we want the most factors
of k/q (and therefore the least number of factors of q in the numerator), so we see that we can
actually set ei~q·~xb → 1 to compute the leading contribution. In this case, the integrals over d3 x1
and d3 x2 are trivial, and one ends up with
hδ~k1 δ~k2 i ≈ hδ̃~k1 δ̃~k2 i .
15

(5.25)

Notice that, since our change of coordinates does not break translation invariance or isotropy, we still have the
general form hδ̃~k δ̃~k0 i = (2π)3 δD (~k + ~k0 )P̃ (k). This is to be contrasted with, for example, redshift space distortions,
which are based on a similar change of coordinates, namely ~
x→~
x − x̂[~v (~
x, t) · x̂]/(aH). Since this transformation
breaks translation invariance by defining a center point, the power spectrum is a general function of ~k and ~k0 [92, 93].
In the more commonly used plane-parallel approximation, redshift space distortions are based on the transformation
~x → ~x − ẑ[~v (~x, t) · ẑ]/(aH) which does not break translations, but does break isotropy. Thus the power spectrum in
that case is diagonal in ~k and ~k0 , but depends on ~k (as opposed to just k).

Now, since we are in the frame of the dark matter, the only velocity that appears is the relative

which is the promised simplification of the solution eq. (4.33). Looking at the expressions in
eq. (4.30) and eq. (5.31), we see that ∆Aα ∼ O(λD λ∆v ), and that ∆B̃α ∼ O(λ2D λ2∆v ) + O(λD λ2∆v ).

the LSS counterterm is similar to the IR contribution eq. (5.32), i.e. both are proportional to k 2 P11 (k). In
particular, we see that the effect of the IR contribution with ∆Ã2α − ∆B̃α = −0.045 is very similar to the
effect of the counterterm with c̄2s = 0.1( h−1 Mpc)2 , which is a typical value (see for example [94]).

where we have included the one-loop counterterm contribution, proportional to c̄2s , from the effective field theory of large-scale structure [7, 8]. As we can see from eq. (5.32), the effect of the IR
contribution is of the same form, proportional to k 2 P11 (k), as the EFT counterterm. Although
these effects are the same in the one-loop power spectrum (unfortunately making it difficult to
measure the violation of the consistency relations in this way), we stress that the origins of these
terms are very different. The EFT counterterm arises from uncomputable UV physics, and the
coefficient c̄2s is a free parameter which should be matched to data in order to consistently incorporate the UV in the perturbative calculation. Different values of c̄2s do not correspond to different
IR theories. The IR contribution, on the other hand, is computable within the theory, since it
16

With the benefit of the simplified solution eq. (5.33), we were able to check it directly. To do so, start with
eq. (4.34), replace f = Ḋ+ /(HD+ ), and plug in the definition of ∆Aα eq. (4.30). Then, use the identity

only depends on IR modes: different values of ∆Ã2α − ∆B̃α correspond to physically different IR
theories. That said, we can place a loose bound on the size of the IR contribution by saying
that it should not be much larger than the typical size of the counterterms measured from galaxy
clustering data [4, 5], which is approximately c̄2s ≈ 0.1( h−1 Mpc)2 . From Fig. 6, we see that this
means that, assuming no large cancellations between contributions,
|∆Ã2α − ∆B̃α | . 0.045 .

(5.38)

After assuming constraints imposed by avoiding gravitational wave decay [56, 57] and instabilities
induced by gravitational waves [58], eq. (5.38) is essentially constraining the size of β1 . However,
connecting this to a rigid constraint on the DHOST parameters would require a fairly involved
analysis, so we leave a detailed study for future work.
As our next example, we look at the tree-level trispectrum. With the solution for δ (3) , we can
also compute the violation of the consistency relations in the double soft limit of the four-point
function. We obtain, after setting ~k1 ≈ −~k2 ,

(5.39)

For theories that satisfy the consistency relations, eq. (3.7) says that this term is zero. However,
we see that because the different diagrams have different coefficients, the cancellation no longer
happens in DHOST theories. This result is intimately connected to the one-loop power spectrum
result, and the two are essentially two sides of the same coin: the IR contribution in the one-loop
power spectrum can be computed by connecting the two soft legs of the trispectrum with a linear
power spectrum and integrating over the intermediate momentum.

5.4

IR-resummation

Finally, we discuss how the violation of the consistency relations affects the evolution of the BAO
signal in the matter power spectrum. In ΛCDM, the consistency relations are satisfied and one
can resum the effects of the long-wavelength velocity on the BAO signal. The reasons for this are
similar to those presented in Sec. 5.1, namely, that the leading IR contributions are fixed by the
effect of the coordinate transformation eq. (3.21). Even though the leading IR contributions cancel
in the extreme IR limit of the equal-time power spectrum (see eq. (3.8)), the effects on oscillatory
features can be large and are computable with eq. (3.21), as in eq. (5.7) for the bispectrum. This
procedure is called the IR-resummation and has been considered for a single species in ΛCDM in,
for example, [73, 86, 18, 87, 81, 74, 88, 80, 89–91].
The situation is different for theories with a large-scale relative velocity which cannot be eliminated by a coordinate transformation, though. This includes the DHOST theories studied in this
paper, and also theories with multiple species, such as dark matter and baryons (see [32] for a
treatment using the eikonal approximation, and [12] using the IR-resummation). Basically, as we
will show below, one can boost to the frame of one of the species, and that large-scale velocity
can be resummed. However, there are perturbative effects of the large-scale relative velocity which
cannot be resummed, and so must continue to be treated perturbatively.
In this work, we focus on the DHOST theories described in Sec. 4, although we expect our results
to be straightforwardly applicable to the two-fluid case. Since we cannot eliminate both velocities
with a single coordinate transformation, we have to choose one to resum. For concreteness, we
28

choose the dark-matter velocity and consider the coordinate transformation defined in eq. (5.22).
In these coordinates, the equation of motion for δ̃ is given by eq. (5.26), plus a series of other
non-linear terms coming from the full DHOST theory (i.e. the terms that are not the leading IR
terms and therefore we did not consider in this work) and from the coordinate transformation,
which can be expanded to the desired order in perturbation theory. Then, the power spectrum
in the original, non-tilde coordinates is given by eq. (5.24), where the δ̃ fields can be expanded
perturbatively, and the large-scale dark-matter velocity is resummed in the exponential. In this
section, we consider the effects only of soft loops, we will work explicitly up to one loop in the
relative velocity, and we will resum to all orders the leading IR terms of the dark-matter velocity.
To organize our calculation, we can write the solutions in the new coordinate system as

Again, to the order that we work, we can take P∆δ̃ (k 0 ) → P11 (k 0 ), and the first line above is of the
same form as the single-fluid ΛCDM resummation eq. (5.42). This is because, after the coordinate
transformation, P∆δ̃ does not contain any long modes, which is analogous to what happens in
ΛCDM for the full power spectrum P̃ Λ . However, the remaining lines above are perturbative
corrections proportional to powers of the large-scale relative velocity. In all terms, though, the
large-scale dark matter velocity has been fully resummed.
As a check, we can compare the above to the one-loop result from perturbation theory. Using
eq. (4.29) and eq. (4.32) , we have

effects of eq. (5.46) on the BAO for future work.

Conclusions

In this work, we have investigated the consequences of the violation of the consistency relations in
theories with dark energy. The gravitational field equations for DHOST theories eqs. (4.1 - 4.3)
contain terms with time derivatives and single spatial derivatives. The structure of these terms
is fixed by the symmetry eq. (4.17), and in particular, the transformation of π is fixed by the
associated coordinate change, see eq. (4.19). This means that in the combined fluid and gravitational field equations eq. (4.26), although invariant under an overall Galilean transformation, the
long-wavelength effects of both v i and ∂i π cannot be eliminated with a single coordinate transformation (i.e. one cannot construct a physical adiabatic mode), contrary to the case in Horndeski
theories. Thus, the standard ΛCDM consistency relations are violated by terms proportional to
the large-scale relative velocity ∆v i ≡ v i + a−1 ∂i π (see also [29]).
Although the consistency relations are violated, we show that the leading effects in the IR are
determined by the linear equations and the symmetries of the fluid system. In this way, we have
computed the effects of the violation on the BAO, the bias expansion, the one-loop power spectrum,
and the tree-level trispectrum, explicitly showing how these effects depend on the relative velocity
∆v i . Specifically, in Sec. 5.1, we showed that the size of the BAO oscillations in the squeezed
limit of the bispectrum can be modified. In Sec. 5.2 we showed how the bias expansion contains
terms proportional to the relative velocity which contribute to the squeezed limit of the galaxy
bispectrum. In Sec. 5.3, we computed the contribution from IR modes to the one-loop power
spectrum and discussed how the perturbative expansion is altered and can depend more strongly
on the IR displacements. We also computed the effect of the violation of the consistency relations
on the double soft limit of the tree-level trispectrum. Finally, in Sec. 5.4, we showed how one can
resum the effects of one of the large-scale velocities in the power spectrum to correctly describe
the BAO. After doing that, the effect of the relative velocity must be included perturbatively. Our
IR-resummation results are also applicable to other systems with a large-scale relative velocity, for
example, dark matter and baryons.
The effects that we have computed are proportional to two separate parameters, λD and λ∆v .
The parameter λD stands for the DHOST parameters, αH and β1 (which enter the linear equation
for δ through νΦ /H and σΦ ), and λ∆v ∼ L∆v /H measures the relative velocity. Both of these
parameters have to be non-zero to see violations of the consistency relations in the ways that we
have discussed. Horndeski theories, for example, have λ∆v ∼ O(1) but λD = 0, and do satisfy the
consistency relations [29]. Similarly, we can have DHOST theories with λD 6= 0, but if λ∆v = 0,
they will still satisfy the consistency relations as well.
In our calculations, because there is not generally an EdS-type approximation for the time
dependence in modified gravity theories, we have considered the exact time dependence of the
linear equations, i.e. we have used the full Green’s function. Thus, our results are also relevant
for perturbation theory in ΛCDM with exact time dependence.
The parameter space of dark-energy theories, including DHOST theories, is already well constrained by observations dealing with, for example, properties of gravitational-wave propagation,
instabilities in the dark energy sector induced by gravitational waves, and Vainshtein screening.

31

However, it could be the case that the UV cutoff of the EFT of dark energy is much smaller than
previously thought [60], in which case some of the constraints placed on the EFT parameters from
small scales (for example in the Vainshtein regime) may not be valid. If this is the case, LSS
effects, such as the ones we have discussed in this work, will be more relevant because they happen
well within the regime of validity of the EFT of dark energy. We leave a detailed study of the
parameter constraints for future work.

A

Review of derivations of the consistency relations

In this Appendix, we present one method of deriving the consistency relations in ΛCDM, called
the background wave argument, and we mostly follow [23]. First, we would like to compute the
leading terms of
hδq~1 (τ1 )δ~k1 (t1 ) · · · δ~kn (tn )i
(A.1)
and
hδq~1 (τ1 )δq~2 (τ2 )δ~k1 (t1 ) · · · δ~kn (tn )i

(A.2)

in the limit qi  kj . Using the definition of conditional probability, we have the following expressions
hδq~1 (τ1 )δ~k1 (t1 ) · · · δ~kn (tn )i = hδq~1 (τ1 )hδ~k1 (t1 ) · · · δ~kn (tn )ivi i ,
L

(A.3)

hδq~1 (τ1 )δq~2 (τ2 )δ~k1 (t1 ) · · · δ~kn (tn )i = hδq~1 (τ1 )δq~2 (τ2 )hδ~k1 (t1 ) · · · δ~kn (tn )ivi i ,
L

where the notation h · ivi means that we only average over configurations which at some fixed
L
time have the large-scale velocity vLi . From the expressions eq. (A.3), we see that we first need to
compute the correlation function of the short modes given the large-scale velocity.
The symmetry eq. (3.3) tells us that
hδ(xi1 , t1 ) · · · δ(xin , tn )ivi = hδ(x̃i1 , t1 ) · · · δ(x̃in , tn )ivi +aṅi
L

(A.4)

L

so that we can relate a correlation function with a large-scale velocity vLi to a correlation function
with a large-scale velocity vLi + aṅi . This is only strictly true if ni has no spatial dependence, so
that we only change the zero mode of the background velocity. However, if we give ni a weak
spatial dependence, eq. (A.4) will capture the leading effects, but of course will be corrected by
higher derivative terms. Thus, we have
hδ(xi1 , t1 ) · · · δ(xin , tn )ivi ≈ hδ(xi1 + niL (~x1 , t1 ), t1 ) · · · δ(xin + niL (~xn , tn ), tn )ivi +aṅi
L

L

L

(A.5)

so we see that if we choose aṅiL = −vLi , we can relate a correlation function with a large scale
velocity vLi to a correlation function with zero large-scale velocity. Choosing niL as in eq. (3.20)

32

means that we are are considering a physical solution. Because this relationship does not depend on
δ (1) being a growing mode, we can consider generic Gaussian initial conditions and time dependence
(1)

δq~ (t) = (T+ (q)D+ (t) + T− (q)D− (t)) ξq~ ≡ T (q, t)ξq~ ,

(A.6)

where ξq~ is a Gaussian field and T± (q) are transfer functions for the growing and decaying modes.

Perturbative correlation functions in the IR limit

For illustration, in this section, we use the solutions from Sec. 3.2 to confirm some examples of the
consistency relations perturbatively. We start with the squeezed limit of the tree-level bispectrum,

where we have used that δq~ is always in the linear regime, is a growing mode solution eq. (2.2),
and that long modes do not correlate with short modes. This indeed matches the expression given
in the non-perturbative consistency relation eq. (3.6).
The calculation for the double soft limit of the tree-level four point function follows in an
analogous manner. This time, the fact that we end up with the form eq. (3.7) is slightly less
trivial, since there are two types of diagrams which have to add together with the correct relative
coefficient. We have (working in the limit q1 , q2  k1 , k2 )

Green’s function manipulations

In this Appendix, we show how to derive the IR solutions for Galilean invariant equations of motion
in perturbation theory with exact time dependence presented in Sec. 3.2. We start with generic
linear equations of the form
δ̈ + ν̄Φ δ̇ − µ̄Φ δ = 0 ,
(B.1)
and then introduce the non-linear terms as in eq. (3.12), which gives the leading IR equations of
motion


δ̈ + ν̄Φ δ̇ − µ̄Φ δ ≈ − a−1 2v i ∂i δ̇ + v̇ i ∂i δ − Hv i ∂i δ − a−2 v i v j ∂i ∂j δ − ν̄Φ a−1 v i ∂i δ .
(B.2)
Notice that these are the same equations as eq. (4.26) if the relative velocity is set to zero there.
We will find the solution to eq. (B.2) by directly using the Green’s function, which satisfies
∂t2 G(t, t̃) + ν̄Φ (t)∂t G(t, t̃) − µ̄Φ (t)G(t, t̃) = δD (t − t̃) ,

(B.3)

and has the usual representation in terms of the linear solutions D± (t) which solve
D̈± + ν̄Φ Ḋ± − µ̄Φ D± = 0 .

(B.4)

The retarded Green’s function is then given by

G(t, t̃) = W (t̃)−1 D− (t)D+ (t̃) − D+ (t)D− (t̃) ΘH (t − t̃) ,

(B.5)

where the Wronskian is given by
W (t) = D+ (t)Ḋ− (t) − D− (t)Ḋ+ (t) .

(B.6)

As a warm up, let us find the solution for δ (2) . We have, valid at leading order in k/q,

(B.8)

Next, we need an identity for the Green’s function. First of all, using eq. (B.4) to replace D̈± , we
have
Ẇ = −ν̄Φ W .
(B.9)
Using this, we find that

ν̄Φ (t̃)Ḡ(t, t̃) − ∂t̃ Ḡ(t, t̃) δ(t̃) + Ḡ(t, t̃)δ̇(t̃) = δ(t)

Linear solutions

Here, we focus on the linear equations of motion to give explicit expressions for the coefficients
appearing in eq. (4.7). As usual, we solve eqs. (4.1 - 4.2) for ∂ 2 Φ and ∂ 2 Ψ in terms of ∂ 2 π, ∂ 2 π̇,
and δ. This has the form

to ∂ 2 π̇ and ∂ 2 π̈ drop out, and we are left with an expression as in eq. (4.7) with
µπ = −

c1 ω3Φ + c2 ω3Ψ + c8 ω̇3Φ + c7 ω̇3Ψ
,
a 2 Cπ

and νπ = −

c8 ω3Φ + c7 ω3Ψ
,
a 2 Cπ

(C.6)

where we have defined
Cπ = 4C3 + c1 ω1Φ + c2 ω1Ψ + c8 ω̇1Φ + c7 ω̇1Ψ .

(C.7)

Next, we plug the solution for ∂ 2 π into eqs. (4.1 - 4.2) to get the solutions for ∂ 2 Φ and ∂ 2 Ψ in
the form eq. (4.7) with
µχN = µπ (ω1χN + 2Hω2χN ) + µ̇π ω2χN + a−2 ω3χN ,
νχN = µπ ω2χN + νπ (ω1χN + 2Hω2χN ) + ν̇π ω2χN ,
σχN =

νπ ω2χN

(C.8)

.

Note that these equations are general: no degeneracy conditions or observational constraints have
been assumed, except to say that the terms proportional to ∂ 2 π̇ and ∂ 2 π̈ drop out of the solution
for ∂ 2 π.
Now, as an example, we specialize to the case where we impose the degeneracy conditions
discussed in the Introduction, along with αH = −2β1 (which imposes that gravitational waves do

Details for IR-resummation

Here we collect some results leading to the power spectrum with the long-wavelength dark-matter
velocity resummed in eq. (5.46). The first term in eq. (5.44) is the same as the ΛCDM case, since
∆δ̃~k does not depend on the long modes, so we have

This will lead to a contribution analogous to the ΛCDM case given in eq. (5.42).
(2)
In the second line of eq. (5.44), however, there is a long mode in δ̃ ~ 0 that correlates with
IR,k

E[δ (1) ], and in the third line of eq. (5.44) there are two long modes that correlate with E[δ (1) ].
Thus, overall, we have to compute

Terms of this form can be straightforwardly computed using the cumulant theorem and relevant
functional derivatives [23], which we review here.
First, it is convenient to define

so that

Now, since in the computation eq. (5.24) we always work to leading order in k/q, we can set
~k 0 ≈ −~k 0 in the factors of J(~q). This gives
