Dedicated to Christian Krattenthaler on the occasion of his 60th birthday

Abstract
We introduce and study a generalization of Schur’s P -/Q-functions associated
to a polynomial sequence, which can be viewed as “Macdonald’s ninth variation”
for P -/Q-functions. This variation includes as special cases Schur’s P -/Q-functions,
Ivanov’s factorial P -/Q-functions and the t = −1 specialization of Hall–Littlewood
functions associated to the classical root systems. We establish several identities and
properties such as generalizations of Schur’s original definition of Schur’s Q-functions,
Cauchy-type identity, Józefiak–Pragacz–Nimmo formula for skew Q-functions, and
Pieri-type rule for multiplication.

Introduction

Schur (S-)functions and Schur P -/Q-functions are two important families of symmetric
functions, and they appear in several parallel situations. For example, in the representation theory of the symmetric groups, Schur functions describe the characters of irreducible
linear representations, while Schur Q-functions describe the characters of irreducible projective representations (see [21]). In the cohomology theory, Schur functions represent the
Schubert classes of Grassmannians, while Schur Q-functions represent the Schubert classes
of Lagrangian Grassmannians (see [19]). Also some identities for Schur functions have their
counterparts for Schur P -/Q-functions.
There are several generalizations, variations or deformations of Schur functions, such
as Hall–Littlewood functions, Macdonald functions and factorial Schur functions. The
generalization relevant to this paper is Macdonald’s ninth variation ([10], see also [15])
associated to a polynomial sequence, which is deﬁned as follows.
Let F = {fd }∞
d=0 be a sequence of polynomials fd (u) ∈ K[u], where K is a ground ﬁeld
of characteristic 0, such that deg fd = d for d ≥ 0. Given a partition λ of length l ≤ n, we
deﬁne the generalized Schur function sF
λ (x1 , . . . , xn ) as the ratio of two alternants:

det
f
λj +n−j (xi ) 1≤i,j≤n

,
(1.1)
sF
λ (x1 , . . . , xn ) =
det fn−j (xi ) 1≤i,j≤n
where λl+1 = · · · = λn = 0. The original Schur functions sλ (x) are recovered by setting
fd (u) = ud for d ≥ 0. And the factorial Schur functions sQ
λ (x|a) with factorial parameters
d
a = (a0 , a1 , . . . ) are obtained by taking fd (u) = (u|a) = d−1
i=0 (u − ai ). Moreover, classical
group characters are special cases of generalized Schur functions. For example, if the
polynomial sequence F = {fd }∞
d=0 is deﬁned by
fd (x + x−1 ) =

xd+1 − x−d−1
x − x−1

(d ≥ 0),

−1
−1
then it is not diﬃcult to see that the generalized Schur function sF
λ (x1 + x1 , . . . , xn + xn )
equals to the irreducible character of the symplectic group Sp2n (C) with highest weight λ.
Generalized Schur functions share many of the same properties as the original Schur
functions. For example, they satisfy the modiﬁed Jacobi–Trudi identity and the Giambelli
identity:

F
sF
λ (x1 , . . . , xn ) = det s(λi −i+j) (xj , . . . , xn ) 1≤i,j≤l

= det sF
(αi |βj ) (x1 , . . . , xn ) 1≤i,j≤r ,

where λ is a partition of length l ≤ n and λ = (α1 , . . . , αr |β1 , . . . , βr ) in the Frobenius
notation.
The aim of this paper is to introduce and study the “ninth variation” of Schur P /Q-functions, which we call generalized P -functions associated to polynomial sequences.
2

We deﬁne generalized P -functions in terms of Nimmo-type formula and derive Pfaﬃan
identities and basic properties by following a linear algebraic approach similar to [18].
We use the following terminologies on polynomial sequences.
Definition 1.1. Let F = {fd }∞
d=0 be a sequence of polynomials fd (u) ∈ K[u]. We say that
F is admissible if it satisﬁes the conditions
f0 (t) = 1,

deg fd = d (d ≥ 1).

(1.2)

And an admissible sequence F is called constant-term free if fd (0) = 0 for any d ≥ 1.
In this article, a partition of length l is a weakly
Pl decreasing sequence λ = (λ1 , . . . , λl ) of
positive integers. We write l = l(λ) and |λ| = i=1 λi . A partition λ of length l is called
strict if λ1 > · · · > λl . The empty sequence ∅ is the unique strict partition of length 0.
For a sequence x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) of n indeterminates, we put


Y xj − xi
xj − xi
A(x) =
, ∆(x) =
.
(1.3)
xj + xi 1≤i,j≤n
x + xi
1≤i<j≤n j
Now we give a deﬁnition of generalized Schur P -functions associated to polynomial sequences in terms of Nimmo-type formula (see [17, (A13)]).
Definition 1.2. For an admissible sequence F = {fd }∞
d=0 of polynomials and a sequence
α = (α1 , . . . , αr ) of nonnegative integers, let VαF (x) be the n × r matrix given by

VαF (x) = fαj (xi ) 1≤i≤n,1≤j≤r .

Given a strict partition λ of length l, we deﬁne the corresponding generalized P -function
PλF (x) associated to F by putting


if n + l is odd,

 ∆(x) Pf −tV F (x)

where λ0 = (λ1 , . . . , λl , 0). We simply write Vα (x) and Pλ (x) for VαF (x) and PλF (x) if there
is no confusion, e.g., in the proofs.
Note that (see Proposition A.1)


Pf A(x)
! if n is even,
∆(x) =
A(x) 1

if n is odd,
Pf

where 1 is the all-one column vector of appropriate size. Hence our deﬁnition (1.4) can be
regarded as a counterpart of the deﬁnition (1.1) of generalized Schur functions.

Example 1.3. (1) It follows from Nimmo’s formula [17, (A13)] that we recover the
original Schur P -function Pλ (x) and Schur Q-function Qλ (x) by setting fd (u) = ud
and fd (u) = 2ud respectively.
(2) It follows from Nimmo-type formula [6, Theorem 3.2] that Ivanov’s factorial P function Pλ (x|a) and Q-function Qλ (x|a) are obtained by taking fd (u) = (u|a)d
and fd (u) = 2(u|a)d respectively.
(3) As we will see in Section 7, our generalized P -functions include the t = −1 specializations of Hall–Littlewood functions associated to the root system of type B, C and
D.
Ikeda–Naruse [3] and Nakagawa–Naruse [16] introduced other generalizations of factorial P - and Q-functions from the viewpoint of Schubert calculus.
The organization and main results of this paper are as follows. In Section 2, we relate our deﬁnition of generalized P -functions (Deﬁnition 1.2) with generalizations of two
other deﬁnitions of Schur P -/Q-functions. Namely we prove that PλF (x) is also obtained
by setting t = −1 in the generalized Hall–Littlewood function associated to a polynomial
sequence (see Theorem 2.3), and that PλF (x) is expressed as the Pfaﬃan of the skewF
symmetric matrix with entries P(λ
(x) (see Theorem 2.6). In Section 3, we introduce
i ,λj )
the notion of generalized dual P -functions PbλF (x) and prove the Cauchy-type identity. In
F
(x) in terms of Józeﬁak–Pragacz–
Section 4, we deﬁne generalized skew P -functions Pλ/µ,p
F
Nimmo tpye Pfaﬃan and prove that Pλ/µ,p (x) appears as the coeﬃcient of PµF (y) in the
expansion of PλF (x, y) (see Theorem 4.2). In Section 5, we consider the modiﬁed Pieri
coeﬃcients in the expansion of the product PµF (x) · Q(r) (x) and obtain a determinant
formula for the generating function of modiﬁed Pieri coeﬃcients (see Theorem 5.3). Section 6 focuses on Ivanov’s factorial P -/Q-functions. We derive a determinant formula of
the factorial skew P -function in one variable (see Theorem 6.5), and an explicit product
formula for the generating function of modiﬁed Pieri coeﬃcients (see Theorem 6.6). In
Section 7, we show that the Hall–Littlewood functions at t = −1 associated to the classical
root systems can be written as generalized P -functions associated to certain polynomial
sequences (see Theorem 7.2). Appendix A collects some Schur-type Pfaﬃan evaluations
and useful formulas.

Several expressions of generalized P -functions

In this section, we give several expressions of generalized P -functions associated to an
admissible polynomial sequence, and study their basic properties.

2.1

Hall–Littlewood-type expression

In this subsection we prove that our generalized P -functions are obtained as the t = −1
specialization of Hall–Littlewood-type functions.

We begin with the following proposition.
Proposition 2.1. Let F be an admissible sequence of polynomials and x = (x1 , . . . , xn ).
Then we have
(1) For the empty partition ∅, we have P∅F (x) = 1.
(2) If λ is a strict partition of length > n, then we have PλF (x) = 0.
Proof. By using the deﬁnition of (1.4), we can derive (1) from the Pfaﬃan evaluations
(A.3) and (A.4), and (2) from Proposition A.5.
We deﬁne a generalization of Hall–Littlewood polynomials associated to an admissible
polynomial sequence.
Definition 2.2. Let n be a positive integer and x = (x1 , . . . , xn ). Given a partition λ
of length l ≤ n, we regard λ as a sequence (λ1 , . . . , λl , 0, . . . , 0) of length n, and deﬁne a
(n)
polynomial vλ (t) by putting

vλ (t) =

j
where mk = {i : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, λi = k} and [m]t ! = m
j=1 (1 − t )/(1 − t). For an admissible
polynomial sequence F and a partition λ of length ≤ n, we deﬁne the generalized Hall–

where Sn is the symmetric group acting on K(t)[x1 , . . . , xn ] by permuting variables.
Setting fd (u) = ud for d ≥ 0, we recover the original Hall–Littlewood polynomials. The
following is the main theorem of this subsection.
Theorem 2.3. For an admissible sequence F and a strict partition λ of length l ≤ n, we
have
(2.2)
PλF (x) = PF
λ (x; −1).
Note that Equation (2.2) with fd (u) = ud is the deﬁnition of Schur P -function adopted
in [11, III.8]. For the sake of completeness and the later use, we give a proof of this theorem,
which follows the argument in [17, Appendix]. As a ﬁrst step, we show the following lemma:

Schur-type Pfaffian formula

In this subsection we use the deﬁnition (1.4) and a Pfaﬃan version of Sylvester formula
(Proposition A.4) to derive the Schur-type Pfaﬃan formula for PλF (x), which generalizes
(a part of) Schur’s original deﬁnition of Schur Q-functions [21, § 35] and a similar formula
for factorial Q-functions [6, Theorem 9.1]. We use the following conventions:

(2.10)

where λ = (λ1 , . . . , λl ) and λ0 = (λ1 , . . . , λl , 0).
In order to prove this theorem, we can use the same argument as in [18, Theorem 4.1
(3) and Remark 4.3]. As we will see in Proposition 2.7, the generalized P -functions do not
have the stability property, so we cannot reduce the proof to the case where n is even.

If n is odd and l is even, then by permuting rows/columns, we see that
Pf X
= Pλ (x),
Pf X([n + 1])

Pf X([n + 1] ∪ {n + 1 + i, n + 1 + j})
= P(λi ,λj ) (x).
Pf X([n + 1])

If n is odd and l is odd, then by expanding the Pfaﬃans along the last row/column, we
have
Pf X
= Pλ (x),
Pf X([n + 1])

Pf X([n + 1] ∪ {n + 1 + i, n + 1 + (l + 1)})
= P(λi ) (x),
Pf X([n + 1])

and by permuting rows/columns we see that
Pf X([n + 1] ∪ {n + 1 + i, n + 1 + j})
= P(λi ,λj ) (x).
Pf X([n + 1])
Now Theorem 2.6 follows immediately from Proposition A.4.

2.3

Stability

The Schur P -functions have the stability property (see [11, III, (2.5)])
Pλ (x1 , . . . , xn , 0) = Pλ (x1 , . . . , xn ).
Our generalizations PλF (x) do not have the stability property in general. For example we
can show that
F
F
P(r)
(x1 , . . . , xn , 0) = P(r)
(x1 , . . . , xn ) + (−1)n fr (0)
for r ≥ 1. The following “mod 2 stability property” was given by [2, Proposition 8.1] for
factorial P -functions.
Proposition 2.7. Let F be an admissible sequence, and λ a strict partition.
(1) In general, we have
PλF (x1 , . . . , xn , 0, 0) = PλF (x1 , . . . , xn ).
(2) If F is constant-term free, then we have
PλF (x1 , . . . , xn , 0) = PλF (x1 , . . . , xn ).

Pfaﬃan along the last row/column, we see that Pλ (x, 0) = Pλ (x). If n + l is odd, then by
permuting rows/columns, we obtain Pλ (x, 0) = Pλ (x).

Relation with generalized Schur functions

We conclude this section by proving a relation between generalized P -functions and generalized Schur functions.
Proposition 2.8. Let F be an admissible sequence and x = (x1 , . . . , xn ). For a partition
µ of length m ≤ n, let µ + δn be the strict partition obtained from (µ1 + n − 1, µ2 + n −
2, . . . , µn−1 + 1, µn ) by removing 0s, where µm+1 = · · · = µn = 0. Then we have

Dual P -functions and Cauchy-type identity

In this section, we introduce the dual of generalized P -functions and prove the Cauchy-type
identity for generalized P -functions.

3.1

Dual sequences

P
i
For a nonzero formal power series g(v) = ∞
i=0 bi v ∈ K[[v]], the order ord g of g is deﬁned
to be the minimum integer k such that bk 6= 0. Let h , i : K[u] × K[[v]] → K be the
non-degenerate bilinear pairing deﬁned by


if i = j = 0,
1
i j
hu , v i = 1/2 if i = j > 0,


0
if i 6= j.
Lemma 3.1. Let F = {fd }∞
d=0 be an admissible sequence of polynomials.

b
(1) Let Fb = {fbd }∞
d=0 be a sequence of formal power series fd (v) ∈ K[[v]] satisfying
ord fbd = d for d ≥ 0. Then hfk , fbl i = δk,l for any k, l ≥ 0 if and only if
∞
X
k=0

fk (u)fbk (v) =

1 + uv
.
1 − uv

(3.1)

b
(2) There exists a unique sequence Fb = {fbd }∞
d=0 satisfying ord fd = d for d ≥ 0 and the
equivalent conditions in (1). We call such a sequence Fb the dual of F .

b
(3) If Fb = {fbd }∞
d=0 is the dual of F , then F is constant-term free if and only if f0 = 1.
12

P
P
Proof. (1), (2) We write fd (u) = i≥0 ad,i ui and fbd (v) = i≥0 bd,i v i . Since deg fd = d and
ord fbd = d, we have ad,i = 0 for i ≥ d + 1 and bd,i = 0 for i ≤ d − 1. We deﬁne b′d,i by
putting
(
bd,0
if i = 0,
b′d,i =
bd,i /2 if i > 0.
Fix a nonnegative integer N and consider two (N +1)×(N +1) matrices A = (ai,j )0≤i,j≤N
and B ′ = (b′i,j )0≤i,j≤N . Then it is easy to see that
(a) hfk , fbl i = δk,l for all 0 ≤ k, l ≤ N if and only if A · tB ′ = IN +1 .

,v
) if
k≥0 fk (u)fk (v) = (1 + uv)/(1 − uv) in the quotient ring K[[u, v]]/(u
t
′
and only if A · B = IN +1 .

The claims (1) and (2) follow from this observation.
(3) If fd (0) = 0 for any d ≥ 1, then by substituting u = 0 in (3.1) we obtain fb0 (v) = 1.
Conversely, if fb0 = 1, then hfd , fb0 i = δd,0 is equal to the constant term of fd .
For example, if fd (u) = ud for d ≥ 0, then the dual of F is given by
(
1
if d = 0,
fbd (v) =
d
2v if d ≥ 1.

See Lemma 6.1 for the dual of the sequence {(u|a)d }∞
d=0 of factorial monomials.

Πz (x) =

n
Y

.

(3.2)

Then the generating functions of Schur Q-functions Q(r) (x) and Q(r,s) (x) are expressed as

functions in terms of the dual sequence Fb.

Lemma 6.1 that the formulas (3.5) and (3.6) reduce to the formulas given in [6, Theorem 8.2] and [6, Theorem 8.4] for factorial P -functions respectively.
Proof. The idea of the proof is similar to that of [18, Theorem 4.1 (1) and (2)]. Let Bz (x)
be the column vector with ith entry (1 + xi z)/(1 − xi z). By (3.1) we have

Generalized skew P -functions

Q
Proof. The coeﬃcient of z r in Πz (x, y) = ni=1 (1 + xi z)/(1 − xi z) · (1 + yz)/(1 − yz)

This lemma can be used to prove the following vanishing property of generalized skew
P -functions. For a strict partition λ, we deﬁne its shifted diagram S(λ) by putting
S(λ) = {(i, j) ∈ Z2 : i ≤ j ≤ λi + i − 1}.
For two strict partitions λ and µ, we write λ ⊃ µ if S(λ) ⊃ S(µ).
Proposition 4.4. Let F be an admissible sequence. For two strict partitions λ and µ, we
F
have Pλ/µ,p
(x) = 0 unless λ ⊃ µ.
Proof. Suppose that there exists an index k such that λk < µk . Then we have, if i ≥ k and
j ≤ k, then λi ≤ λk < µk ≤ µj and Rλi /µj (x) = 0 Lemma 4.3. Hence the skew-symmetric

matrices X appearing in the deﬁnition (4.3) of Pλ/µ,p
(x) are of the form

where W has k columns and at most (k − 1) nonzero rows. Since all the k × k minors of W
F
vanish, it follows from the Laplace expansion (Proposition A.5) that Pλ/µ,p
(x) = Pf X = 0.
F
If the polynomial sequence F is constant-term free, then the skew P -function Pλ/µ,p
is
independent of p and some formulas have simple forms.

Proof of Theorem 4.2

We give a proof of Theorem 4.2 by using the same idea as in the proof of [18, Theorem 6.1]
for Schur Q-functions. A key is played by the following proposition, which interpolates the
Nimmo-type formula (1.4) (n = 0 case) and the Schur-type formula (2.10) (p = 0 case).
Proposition 4.7. Let F be an admissible polynomial sequence and x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and
y = (y1 , . . . , yp ) two sequence of indeterminates. For a non-negative integer sequence
α = (α1 , . . . , αr ), let NαF (x|y) be the r × p matrix deﬁned by

NαF (x|y) = PαFi (x, yj ) 1≤i≤r,1≤j≤p

where λ0 = (λ1 , . . . , λl , 0), and SαF (x) and A(y) are given by (2.9) and (1.3) respectively.

We denote by Pλ′ (x|y) the right hand side of (4.6). First we prove that Pλ′ (x|y) satisfy
the Schur-type Pfaﬃan formula:
Lemma 4.8. For a strict partition λ of length l, we have

Pieri-type rule

In this section we give a Pieri-type rule for the product of any generalized P -function
PλF (x) with Schur Q-function Q(r) (x) corresponding to a one-row partition.

5.1

The ring of Schur P - and Q-functions

Let Γ(n) be the subring of the ring of symmetric polynomials Λ(n) = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]Sn deﬁned
by
Γ(n) = {f ∈ K[x1 , . . . , xn ]Sn : f (t, −t, x3 , . . . , xn ) is independent of t}
Then it is known that Schur P -functions {Pλ (x) : λ ∈ S (n) } form a basis of Γ(n) , where
S (n) is the set of all strict partitions of length ≤ n (see [19, Theorem 2.11]).
We give a relation between two families of generalized P -functions associated to diﬀerent
admissible sequences.
∞
Proposition 5.1. Let F = {fd }∞
d=0 and G = {gd }d=0 be two admissible sequences. For a
strict partition λ of length l ≤ n, the generalized P -function PλF (x) associated to F can
be written as a K-linear combination of the generalized P -functions PµG (x) associated to
G in the following form:
X
aλ,µ PµG (x),
PλF (x) = aλ,λ PλG (x) +
µ(λ

where aλ,λ 6= 0, and µ runs over all strict partitions satisfying µ ( λ.
P
Proof. We write fk = ∞
i=0 ak,l gl for k ≥ 0. Then by the assumption (1.2) we have ak,l = 0
for k < l, ak,k 6= 0, and a0,0 = 1.
If n + l is even, then by using the multilinear and alternating property of Pfaﬃans we
have

or l, we put

aλ,µ = det aλi ,µj 1≤i,j≤l ,
27

where µl = 0 if l(µ) = l − 1. We prove that aλ,λ 6= 0 and aλ,µ = 0 unless λ ⊃ µ. Since

Q
the matrix aλi ,λj 1≤i,j≤l is upper-triangular, we have aλ,λ = li=1 aλi ,λi 6= 0. If there is an
index k such that λk < µk , then we have λi ≤ λk < µk ≤ µj and aλi ,µj = 0 for i ≥ k and
j ≤ k and thus aλ,µ = 0. Hence we obtain the desired result.
Corollary 5.2. The generalized P -functions {PλF (x) : λ ∈ S (n) } associated to a ﬁxed
sequence F form a basis of Γ(n) .

5.2

Pieri-type rule

Let qr (x) = Q(r) (x) be the Schur Q-function corresponding to a one-row partition (r), and
set q0 (x) = 1. It is known (see [11, III.(8.5)]) that Γ(n) is generated by qr (x) (r ≥ 1). Thus
the algebra structure of Γ(n) is governed by the multiplication rule for qr (x)s.
Theorem 5.3. Let F = {fd }∞
d=0 be an admissible sequence. We deﬁne formal power series
bsr (z) by the relation

Applications to Factorial P - and Q-functions

In this section we focus on Ivanov’s factorial P - and Q-functions.

6.1

Factorial P - and Q-functions

Recall the deﬁnition of Ivanov’s factorial P - and Q-functions. Let a = (a0 , a1 , . . . ) be
parameters, called factorial parameters. We deﬁne the factorial monomial (u|a)d by putting
d

(u|a) =

d−1
Y

(u − ai ).

i=0

Then the factorial P -function Pλ (x|a) is deﬁned to be the generalized P -function PλF (x)
associated to F = {(u|a)d }∞
d=0 (see Deﬁnition 1.2). And the factorial Q-function Qλ (x|a)
is deﬁned by
Qλ (x|a) = 2l(λ) Pλ (x|a).
The factorial Q-function Qλ (x|a) is also the generalized P -function PλF (x) associated to
the sequence F ′ = {fd′ }∞
d=0 given by
(
1
if d = 0,
fd′ (u) =
2(u|a)d if d ≥ 1.
′

Note that the sequence F = {(u|a)d }∞
d=0 is constant-term free if and only if a0 = 0.
Since the factorial P - and Q-functions are the special cases of our generalized P functions, we can recover some formulas in [5] and [6] from the results of Section 2. For
example, we recover [6, Theorem 9.1] without assumption a0 = 0:

Qλ (x|a) = Pf Q(λi ,λj ) (x|a) 1≤i,j≤r ,
where r = l(λ) if l(λ) is even and l(λ) + 1 if l(λ) is odd, and λl(λ)+1 = 0. (We use the
convention (2.8).)
Next we compute explicitly the dual of F = {(t|a)d }∞
d=0 introduced in Section 3.
d ∞
Lemma 6.1. Let Fb = {fbd }∞
d=0 be the dual of F = {(u|a) }d=0 . Then we have

31

Proof. Put fd (u) = (u|a)d . The sequence {fbd }∞
d=0 is uniquely determined by the relation
b
(3.1). Since f0 = 1, we see that f0 (v) is determined by substituting u = a0 in (3.1), and
obtain fb0 (v) = (1 + a0 v)/(1 − a0 v). Let r > 0. Since fk (ar ) = 0 for k > r and fr (ar ) 6= 0,
we see that fbr (t) is determined inductively by the relation
Hence it is enough to show

1 − ar v 1 − a0 v

by the induction hypothesis with factorial parameters (a2 , . . . , ar ), we have

Factorial skew P -functions

For two strict partitions λ and µ and a positive integer p, we denote by Pλ/µ,p (x|a) the
F
generalized skew P -functions Pλ/µ,p
(x) associated to F = {(u|a)d }∞
d=0 , and call it the
r
factorial skew P -function (see Deﬁnition 4.1). Since (u|a) depends only on a0 , a1 , . . . , ar−1 ,
it follows from the deﬁnition (1.4) that P(r) (x|a) also depends only on a0 , a1 , . . . , ar−1 . So
we write P(r) (x|a0 , a1 , . . . , ar−1 ) for P(r) (x|a).
Proposition 6.2. We deﬁne Rr/k (x|a) by the relation
P(r) (x, y|a) =

Rr/k (x|a)(y|a)k .

(6.4)

If x = (x) consists of a single variable, then P(r) (x|a) = (x|a)r . Hence we obtain

By a similar argument to the proof of Proposition 4.6, we can derive the determinant
formula for Pλ/µ,p (x|a) for a single variable x.
Theorem 6.5. Let a = (a0 , a1 , . . . ) be factorial parameters. For two strict partitions λ of
lenth l and µ of length m, the factorial skew P -function Pλ/µ,p (x|a) in a single variable x
is given as follows:
(1) We have Pλ/µ,p (x|a) = 0 unless λ ⊃ µ and m = l or l − 1.
(2) If λ ⊃ µ and m = l or l − 1, then we have
Pλ/µ,p (x|a) = det Rλi /µj (x|a)



1≤i,j≤l

.

Proof. It follows from Proposition 4.4 that Pλ/µ,p (x|a) = 0 unless λ ⊃ µ. By a similar
argument to the proof of Proposition 4.5, we can show the following:
(a) if l ≡ p and m ≡ p mod 2, then

It remains to consider the case where l 6≡ p and m 6≡ p mod 2. By the deﬁnition (4.3) and

We can use this theorem to provide a lattice path proof to the tableau description of

a0 = 0).

6.3

Modified Pieri coefficients

In this subsection, we give a combinatorial description to the modiﬁed Pieri coeﬃcients for
factorial P -functions. Recall that the skew shifted diagram S(λ/µ) = S(λ) \ S(µ) is called
a border strip if it is connected and contains no 2 × 2 block of cells.
37

Theorem 6.6. Let a = (a0 , a1 , . . . ) be factorial parameters. We deﬁne the modiﬁed Pieri
coeﬃcient cλµ,r (a) by the relation
Pµ (x|a) · qr (x) =

X

cλµ,r (a)Pλ (x|a),

(6.8)

λ

where qr (x) = Q(r) (x) is Schur’s Q-function, and λ runs over all strict partitions. For two
strict partitions λ and µ, we consider the generating function of modiﬁed Pieri coeﬃcients
cλµ (z|a) =

∞
X

cλµ,r (a)z r .

r=0

Then we have
(1) If the skew shifted diagram S(λ/µ) contains a 2 × 2 block of cells, then we have
cλµ (z|a) = 0.
(2) Suppose that S(λ/µ) contains no 2 × 2 block of cells. Let
S(λ/µ) =

r
G

S((λm(i) , . . . , λM (i) )/(µm(i) , . . . , µM (i) ))

be the decomposition of S(λ)/S(µ) into a disjoint union of border strips, where
m(1) ≤ M(1) < m(2) ≤ M(2) < · · · < m(r) ≤ M(r). Then we have
cλµ (z|a)

if n + l(µ) is even,
K=
{k : 1 ≤ k ≤ l(µ) + 1, λk = µk } if n + l(µ) is odd.

(3) In particular, the modiﬁed Pieri coeﬃcient cλµ,r (a) is a polynomial in the factorial
parameters a0 , a1 , . . . with nonnegative integer coeﬃcients.
Example 6.7. Let λ = (8, 6, 4, 3, 2) and µ = (6, 5, 4, 2, 1). Then the skew shifted Young
diagram S(λ/µ) is decomposed into a disjoint union of border strips as follows:

S(λ/µ) =
= S((8, 6)/(6, 5)) ⊔ S((3, 2)/(2, 1)).
38

Setting a0 = a1 = · · · = 0, we recover the Pieri rule for Schur P -functions.

k, we have
X
Pµ (x) · qr (x) =
2a(λ,µ) Pλ (x),
λ

where λ runs over all strict partitions such that |λ| − |µ| = r and S(λ/µ) contains no 2 × 2
block and a(λ, µ) is the number of connected components of S(λ/µ).

Now we use Theorem 5.3 to give a proof of Theorem 6.6. Let bsr (z|a) be the coeﬃcient
in the expansion
1 + uz X s
=
br (z|a)(u|a)s .

Qr−1
By dividing the both sides of (6.11) by i=0
(u − ai ) and then by shifting the indices of
factorial parameters, we may assume r = 0. This case follows from Lemma 6.1.
We prove Theorem 6.6 by computing the determinant given in (5.3) of Theorem 5.3.
39

Proof of Theorem 6.6. By (5.3), we see that nonzero cλµ (z|a) is equal to the determinant
whose (i, j) entry is equal to bλµij = bλµij (z|a).
Claim 6.10. We have cλµ (z|a) = 0 unless S(λ) ⊃ S(µ).
Proof. If then there exists an index k such that λk < µk , then we have λi < λk < µk < µj
for i ≥ k and j ≤ k. By Lemma 6.9, we have bλµij = 0 for i ≥ k and j ≤ k, thus cλµ = 0.
In what follows we assume that S(λ) ⊃ S(µ). In this case, by Theorem 5.3, we have

if n + l(µ) is even and l(λ) = l(µ),
if n + l(µ) is odd and l(λ) = l(µ),
if l(λ) = l(µ) + 1,
otherwise.

If n + l(µ) is odd and l(λ) = l(µ) = l, then b0µj = 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ l by Lemma 6.9. By
expanding the determinant along the last row, we have
0

det Bµλ0 = b00 · det Bµλ .
Hence it is enough to compute the determinant det Bµλ∗ , where µ∗ = µ or µ0 . By abuse of
the notation, we write simply Bµλ for Bµλ and Bµλ0 in the following.
First we consider the case S(λ/µ) is not connected. In this case, there exists an index
k such that λk+1 < µk or λk = µk .
Claim 6.11. Suppose that S(λ) ⊃ S(µ).
(1) If there exists an index k such that λk+1 < µk , then we have

′′

det Bµλ = det Bµλ′ · det Bµλ′′ ,
where
λ′ = (λ1 , . . . , λk ),
λ′′ = (λk+1, . . . , λl ),

µ′ = (µ1 , . . . , µk ),
µ′′ = (µk+1 , . . . , µl ).

(2) If there exists an index k such that λk = µk > 0, then we have

det Bµλ = det Bµλ′ · bλµkk · det Bµλ′′ ,
where
λ′ = (λ1 , . . . , λk−1 ),
λ′′ = (λk+1, . . . , λl ),
40

µ′ = (µ1 , . . . , µk−1),
µ′′ = (µk+1 , . . . , µl ).

Proof. (1) If i ≥ k + 1 and j ≤ k, then we have λi ≤ λk+1 < µk ≤ µj and bλµij = 0, thus

Now we consider the case where S(λ/µ) is connected.
Claim 6.12. Suppose that S(λ) ⊃ S(µ) and S(λ/µ) is connected. If S(λ/µ) contains a
2 × 2 block of cells, then we have det Bµλ = 0.
Proof. If S(λ/µ) contains a 2 × 2 square, then there exists an index k such that λk+1 > µk .
We take the minimum such index k. Then we have
λ1 > µ1 = λ2 > µ2 = λ3 > · · · > µk−1 = λk > λk+1 > µk .
(Since S(λ/µ) is connected, we have λi+1 ≥ µi if λi+1 > 0.) It follows from Lemma 6.9
that, if t > s > r, then
z t−s
btr = bsr ·
.
(6.12)
(1 − as+1 z) · · · (1 − at z)
We proceed by induction on k. If k = 1, then the ﬁrst row of Bµλ is a scalar multiple of
the second row by (6.12), and det Bµλ = 0. If k > 1, then by subtracting the (k + 1)st row
multiplied by z λk −λk+1 /(1 − aλk+1 +1 z) · · · (1 − aλk z) from the kth row in det Bµλ , and then
by expanding the resulting determinant along the kth row, we have
′

det Bµλ = (−1)k+(k−1) bλµkk−1 det Bµλ′ ,
where λ′ (resp. µ′ ) is the strict partition obtained from λ (resp. µ) by removing λk (resp.
µk−1 ), i.e.,
λ′ = (λ1 , . . . , λk−1, λk+1 , . . . , λl ),

µ′ = (µ1 , . . . , µk−2, µk , . . . , µl ).

′

Since det Bµλ′ = 0 by the induction hypothesis, we obtain det Bµλ = 0.
Now it remains to compute det Bµλ when S(λ/µ) is a border strip.
Claim 6.13. If S(λ/µ) is a border strip, i.e.,
λ1 > µ1 = λ2 > µ2 = λ3 > · · · > µl−1 = λl > µl ,
then we have

2z λ1 −µl
.
det Bµλ = Qλ1
i=µl (1 − ai z)
41

Proof. We proceed by induction on l. A direct computation shows the cases l = 1 and
l = 2. So we assume l ≥ 3. By Lemma 6.9, we have
z µl−1 −µl
bλµil = Qµl−1 −1

then subtract the lth column from the (l − 1)st column. Since we have

1 − aλl µl−1

we expand the resulting determinant along the (l − 1)st column to see

det Bµλ = Qµl−1 −1

j=µl (1 − aj z)

where λ′ = (λ1 , . . . , λl−1 ) and µ′ = (µ1 , . . . , µl−1 ). Using the induction hypothesis, we
obtain Claim 6.13.
Combining the above claims together completes the proof.
Based on Theorem 6.6 (3) and some experimental evidence, we propose the following
conjecture.

Then Molev–Sagan [13, Theorem 3.1] gave a combinatorial formula for the coeﬃcient
mλµ,ν (a, b), which implies that mλµ,ν (a, b) is a polynomial in a and b with nonnegative
integer coeﬃcients.

P -functions associated to classical root systems

In this section we show that the Hall–Littlewood functions at t = −1 associated to the
classical root systems can be written as generalized P -functions associated to certain polynomial sequences.

Hall–Littlewood function associated root systems

Macdonald [12] generalized the deﬁnition of Hall–Littlewood functions to any root system.
Let Φ be a root system in a Euclidean vector space V and ﬁx a positive system Φ+ .
We denote by Λ and Λ+ the weight lattice and the set of dominant weights respectively.
Let K = Q(t) be the rational function ﬁeld in an indeterminate t and K[Λ] the group
algebra of Λ with basis {eλ : λ ∈ Λ} over K. Let W be the Weyl group of Φ. Then the
Hall–Littlewood functions associated to the root system Φ are deﬁned as follows:

In this section we consider the root systems of types Xn = Bn , Cn and Dn . Let V
be the n-dimensional Euclidean vector space with orthonormal basis ε1 , . . . , εn . We put

xi = eεi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and write PΦ
λ = Pλ (x; t). Let Φ(Xn ) ⊂ V be the root system of type

In order to prove Theorem 7.2, we recall the structure of the Weyl group of type Bn ,
Cn and Dn . Let Tn be the abelian group of order 2n generated by t1 , . . . , tn subject to
the relations t2i = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and ti tj = tj ti (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n), and Wn = Tn ⋊ Sn the
semidirect product of Tn with the P
symmetric group Sn , where Sn acts on Tn by permuting

un
′
t1 , . . . , tn . Put Tn = {t1 . . . tn : ni=1 ui ≡ 0 mod 2} and Wn′ = Tn′ ⋊ Sn the semidirect
product of Tn′ with Sn . Then Wn is isomorphic to the Weyl group of type Bn and Cn ,
and Wn′ is isomorphic to the Weyl group of type Dn . The natural action of Sn on V and
K[x1±1 , . . . , x±1

Generating functions

Since the Q-functions QX
λ (x) of type X are special cases of generalized P -functions, we
have the Schur-type Pfaﬃan formula:
Proposition 7.5. For a strict partition λ of length l, we have

Qλ (x) = Pf Q(λi ,λj ) (x)

where r = l or l + 1 according whether l is even or odd, and we use the convention (2.8).
Hence, in order to obtain QX
λ (x) for a general strict partition λ, we need to know
and QX
(x).
We
compute
the generating functions for them. To state formulas,

by using the Pfaﬃan evaluations in Proposition A.3. The details are left to the readers.

A

Pfaffian formulas

In this appendix, we collect several useful Pfaﬃan identities.
48

A.1

Pfaffians

Recall the deﬁnition and some properties of Pfaﬃans (see [4] for some expositions). Let
X = xij 1≤i,j≤2m be a skew-symmetric matrix of order 2m. The Pfaffian of X, denoted
by Pf(X), is deﬁned by
Pf(X) =

X

sgn(σ)

m
Y

xσ(2i−1),σ(2i) ,

(A.1)

i=1

σ∈F2m

where F2m is the set of permutations σ ∈ S2m satisfying σ(1) < σ(3) < · · · < σ(2m − 1)
and σ(2i − 1) < σ(2i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.

Pfaﬃans are multilinear and alternating in the following sense. Let X = xij 1≤i,j≤n
be a skew-symmetric matrix and ﬁx a row/column index k. If the entries of the kth row
and kth column of X are written as xi,j = αx′i,j + βx′′i,j for i = k or j = k, then
Pf X = α Pf X ′ + β Pf X ′′ ,
where X ′ (resp. X ′′ ) is the skew-symmetric matrix obtained from X by replacing the
entries xij for i = k or j = k with x′ij (resp. x′′ij ). And, for a permutation σ ∈ Sn , we have


Pf xσ(i),σ(j) 1≤i,j≤n = sgn(σ) Pf xi,j 1≤i,j≤n .

It follows that, if Y is the skew-symmetric matrix obtained from X by adding the kth row
multiplied by a scalar α to the lth row and then adding the kth column multiplied by α
to the lth column, the we have Pf Y = Pf X.
We use the following notations for submatrices. For a P
positive integer n, we put [n] =
{1, 2, . . . , n}.
i∈I i. For an M × N matrix
 Given a subset I ⊂ [n], we put Σ(I) =
X = xi,j 1≤i≤M,1≤j≤N and subsets I ⊂ [M] and J ⊂ [N], we denote by X(I; J) the
submatrix of X obtained by picking up rows indexed by I and columns indexed by J. If X
is a skew-symmetric matrix, then we write X(I) for X(I; I). We use the convention that
det X(∅; ∅) = 1 and Pf X(∅) = 1.

For an n × n skew-symmetric matrix X = xi,j 1≤i,j≤n , we have the following expansion
formula along the kth row/column:
Pf X =

(−1)k+i−1 xi,k Pf X([n] \ {i, k}) +

derived from (A.3) by specializing the last indeterminate to 0.

Πz (x) = Π(x; (z)) = ni=1 (1 + xi z)/(1 − xi z). Then we have the following variations of

Useful formulas for Pfaffians

The following propositions are Pfaﬃan analogues of the Sylvester identity, the Laplace
expansion formula, and the Cauchy–Binet formula for determinants.
