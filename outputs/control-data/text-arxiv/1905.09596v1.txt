Abstract. This paper proposes a market consistent valuation framework for variable
annuities with guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit, death benefit and surrender
benefit features. The setup is based on a hybrid model for the financial market and uses
time-inhomogeneous Lévy processes as risk drivers. Further, we allow for dependence
between financial and surrender risks. Our model leads to explicit analytical formulas
for the quantities of interest, and practical and efficient numerical procedures for the
evaluation of these formulas. We illustrate the tractability of this approach by means of a
detailed sensitivity analysis of the price of the variable annuity and its components with
respect to the model parameters. The results highlight the role played by the surrender
behaviour and the importance of its appropriate modelling.

1. Introduction
Variables Annuities (VAs) are unit-linked investment policies providing a post-retirement
income, which is generated by the returns on a suitably managed financial portfolio. Various guarantees are applied with the aim of providing protection of the policyholders’ saving
accounts. VAs are popular insurance products in the US, Japan, the UK, and are increasingly present in the other European markets as well. According to the Life Insurance and
Market Research Association (LIMRA) Secure Retirement Institute and the Insured Retirement Institute (IRI), VAs sales for 2018 in the US were more than $100 billion - a 2%
increase compared to 2017.
Common types of guarantees offered by variable annuity contracts are the so-called Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (GMAB), the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit
(henceforth DB) - which applies in case of early death - the Guaranteed Minimum Income
Benefit and the Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit. The former two offer protection
during the accumulation period, i.e. up to the expiration of the contract, whilst the latter
two provide payouts after expiration, during the so-called ‘annuitization’ period. For an
extensive overview and classification of these products we refer to Bacinello et al. (2011)
and references therein.

Due to the construction of these contracts, the underwriting insurance companies are
exposed to financial and mortality risk, as well as surrender risk originated by the policyholder behaviour. Indeed, the option to leave the contract prior to maturity is a common
additional feature of insurance contracts, which might cause significant cash outflows for the
insurer, and negatively impact on the market growth of VAs (LIMRA Secure Retirement
Institute).
The study of the pricing of life insurance contracts in presence of financial risk has been
pioneered by Brennan and Schwartz (1976) and Boyle and Schwartz (1977); an extensive
literature has developed since, from the seminal contributions of Albizzati and Geman
(1994), Bacinello and Ortu (1996) and Grosen and Jørgensen (2002), to the more recent
ones of Bacinello et al. (2011), Deelstra and Rayée (2013), Giacinto et al. (2014) and Gudkov
et al. (2018), to mention a few. These contributions distinguish themselves in terms of
the specific product under consideration, although they are all based on diffusion-driven
market models. Extensions to financial dynamics driven by Lévy processes are considered
in Ballotta (2005, 2009), although in these papers the focus is primarily on equity markets
as the rate of interest is assumed constant and the possibility of surrender is not considered.
In light of the above, the aim of this paper is to provide a realistic framework for the
modelling of these risks and the market consistent pricing of variable annuity contracts.
We focus specifically on the pricing of the GMAB, the DB and the quantification of the
surrender risk by means of the so-called Surrender Benefit (SB), contributing to the current
state of the literature in a number of ways. Firstly, contrary to the literature mentioned
above, we propose a general joint model for financial and insurance risks, which is driven by
time-inhomogeneous Lévy processes. Our choice is motivated by the increased distributional
flexibility offered by these stochastic processes in portraying observed market trends (see, for
example, Eberlein and Keller, 1995, for an extensive empirical analysis of equity markets).
In more details, for the financial market we adopt the hybrid construction of Eberlein
and Rudmann (2018) in which the stochastic dependence between interest rate markets
and stock markets is taken into account explicitly. This feature is an important aspect in
this context given the typically long maturity of insurance contracts.
Further, we subdivide insurance risk into surrender risk and mortality risk. For the surrender risk, we follow market practice by considering two components: one capturing the
baseline surrender behaviour due to non-economic factors and personal contingencies, and
the second one which instead is responsive to changes in the conditions of the financial
markets (see Kolkiewicz and Tan, 2006, Le Courtois and Nakagawa, 2011, Ducuroir et al.,
2016, for example). This component in particular includes a function of the spread between
the rate of the contract and the rate offered on the market for equivalent products, and
therefore incorporates the stochastic inputs from the financial market model. The function
of choice is designed as to suitably accommodate for surrender triggering arguments based
on the moneyness hypothesis (see Knoller et al., 2016, for example), the interest rate hypothesis and the emergency fund hypothesis (see, for example, Nolte and Schneider, 2017,
and references therein).
For mortality risk, we adopt an extended Gompertz-Makeham model with stochastic
mortality improvement ratio as in Krayzler et al. (2016) and Escobar et al. (2016); however

3

we make the natural assumption of stochastic independence between the demographic and
the financial risks.
Secondly, through the proposed general framework we obtain closed analytical formulas
(up to a multidimensional integral) for the price of the guarantees and the SB. The dimensionality of these integrals is dictated by the frequency with which the policyholder is
allowed to terminate the contract.
Finally, we also develop a practical and efficient numerical scheme for the evaluation of
these formulas by means of Monte Carlo integration with importance sampling, and we
illustrate its applicability by performing a sensitivity analysis of the contract’s value with
respect to the model parameters. The results from this analysis underline the importance
of a correct calibration of the model to the observed surrender rates.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the model for the financial
market; the contract features of the VAs are introduced in section 3 together with the additional modelling assumptions regarding mortality and surrender risk. The closed analytical
pricing formulas are derived in section 4; the corresponding numerical scheme is offered in
section 5. We present the results of the sensitivity analysis in section 6, whilst section 7
concludes.
Additional material, including some of the proofs, is provided in the appendix.
2. The interest rate and equity market
The aim of this section is to introduce a joint model for the interest rate and the equity
markets used to develop the pricing framework for variable annuities. Specifically, we
follow Eberlein and Rudmann (2018) and build this joint model on time-inhomogenous
Lévy processes. Thus we first offer some necessary preliminary results with the pricing
application in view.
2.1. Time-inhomogenous Lévy process and pricing. Given a finite time horizon
T ∗ > 0, consider a stochastic basis (Ω, F , F, Q) with a filtration F = (Ft )t∈[0,T ∗ ] satisfying
the usual conditions. Due to our focus on pricing, the probability measure Q represents a
risk-neutral martingale measure. Let L1 and L2 be two independent time-inhomogeneous
Lévy processes, i.e. continuous-time processes with independent increments, and with characteristic function

We note that a financial market built on (exponential) Lévy processes is in general
incomplete, and consequently the risk neutral martingale measure is not unique. Standard
practice in this case is to fix the pricing measure via calibration, using market quotes for
traded derivatives contracts written on the quantities of interest, i.e. bonds and stocks in
the specific case of our application. As model calibration is not in the scope of this paper, we

4

refer to Eberlein and Rudmann (2018) for a detailed illustration of the calibration procedure
for the adopted joint model. Nevertheless, for any risk neutral martingale measure to be
well defined, we require that the exponential moments of a certain order exist. To this
purpose, the following assumption holds throughout the rest of this paper.
Assumption 2.1 (Exponential moments). For j = 1, 2, there exist positive constants Mj
and j such that for each u ∈ [−(1 + j )Mj , (1 + j )Mj ]

All standard processes used in mathematical finance such as hyperbolic, normal Inverse
Gaussian, Variance Gamma and CGMY processes satisfy the above condition. Assumption
2.1 implies the existence of the first moment of the process; this allows us to rewrite (1) as

where the integrals are defined component-wise for the real and imaginary part (see Eberlein
and Raible, 1999, for full details).
2.2. The fixed income market. For the modelling of the fixed income market we follow the approach in Eberlein et al. (2005) (see also Eberlein and Raible, 1999), so that
the starting point is the definition of the dynamics of the instantaneous forward rates
(f (t, T )0≤t≤T ≤T ∗ ). Let us assume that

for a deterministic and bounded function f (0, T ). The drift function α(·) and the volatility
function σ1 (·) are assumed to satisfy the usual conditions of measurability and boundedness
(see Eberlein et al., 2005, (2.5)). The price of a zero coupon bond at time t with maturity

We remind that the short rate rt is implicitly given by the forward rate dynamics in
equation (3) by setting T = t. Finally, we assume that
M1

where M1 is the constant from Assumption 2.1; this guarantees that the exponential of the
stochastic integral has finite expectation.
For the market to be arbitrage free, we require that (Bt−1 B(t, T ))0≤t≤T , with Bt =

Rt
exp 0 r(s)ds , is a martingale; it follows from (2) that Q is a martingale measure if
Σ(s, T ) ≤

A(s, T ) = θs1 (Σ(s, T )), 0 ≤ s ≤ T.

(5)

In the following we will always assume that the drift condition (5) holds.

2.3. The stock market. For the modelling of the equity market, we consider the case of
a single asset, be it a single stock or a stock index. More general settings can be obtained
in a straightforward manner.
It is well known from a number of empirical studies that equity and fixed income markets
influence each other; this interaction is of particular importance in the context of long-dated
insurance contracts. Thus, following Eberlein and Rudmann (2018) we choose an approach
which allows for stochastic dependence between the two markets. Consequently, we model
the price process of the asset as

In this hybrid approach, the driver of the interest rate dynamics affects explicitly the
Rt
stock price in reason of β(·) through the term 0 β(s)dL1s . Further dependence is originated
Rt
endogenously by the (integrated) short rate, i.e. the classical risk neutral term 0 r(s)ds.
σ2 (·) is a positive function and denotes the volatility of the stock price. Both, σ2 (·) and
β(·), could be chosen as random processes, but having numerical aspects in mind, in the
following we consider deterministic functions σ2 (·) and β(·). To ensure the existence of
exponential moments we require
M2
M1
,
|β(s)| ≤

(7)

with M1 , M2 the constants from Assumption 2.1. The drift term ω(t) in (6) is chosen such
that the discounted stock price (Bt−1 St )t∈[0,T ∗ ] is a Q-martingale. Equation (2) and the
independence of the two driving processes L1 and L2 imply that
Z t
ω(t) =
[θs2 (σ2 (s)) + θs1 (β(s))]ds.
(8)
σ2 (s) ≤

Hence, under (5) and (8) the joint market model for bonds and security S is free of arbitrage.

3. The variable annuity contract
A variable annuity (VA) is an insurance contract which gives the holder a variety of
benefits depending on the notional I in exchange for an initial premium which we will
determine in the following. This premium is paid once at inception of the VA contract.
The maturity T of the contract is assumed to satisfy 0 < T ≤ T ∗ . In the specification
considered here, the VA includes three features: a Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation
Benefit (GMAB), a Surrender Benefit (SB), and a Death Benefit (DB).
In details, at maturity T the GMAB pays to the policyholder
max(IST , G(T )),
with G(T ) = I exp(δT ), δ > 0. In other words, the GMAB offers the best of the investment
of an amount I in either the asset S or in a risk-free account with guaranteed rate δ. Note
that, in order to simplify the notation, in the following we assume that the price process
of the asset is normalized so that S0 = 1. This payoff, however, can only be claimed if the
policyholder is still alive at time T and did not exercise the surrender option before.
In case of early surrender, the right of refund is restricted to the current value of the
fund reduced by a compulsory surrender penalty. Let the penalty P : [0, T ] → (0, 1] be an
increasing function with P (T ) = 1, and define t := (t0 , t1 , . . . , tK )> with 0 = t0 < t1 <
. . . < tK < T . We assume that premature surrender is possible at any time point ti ∈ t
with i = 1, . . . , K − 1, in which case the policyholder would receive the amount
ISti P (ti ),
Small values of the penalty P at early dates would allow the insurer to recover any expenses
related to the writing of the contract even in case of early surrender. The penalty could
also serve to the insurer to hedge against a significant rise in the fund value.
Finally, in case of death before maturity T , the death benefit pays (to the beneficiaries)
max(ISt̄i , G(t̄i )),
for t̄i ∈ t̄, i = 1, . . . , N , and t̄ := (t̄0 , t̄1 , . . . , t̄N )> with 0 = t̄0 < t̄1 < . . . < t̄N = T . The
time points t¯i denote the frequency with which mortality is monitored by the insurer over
the lifetime of the contract.
In principle, the time scales t and t̄ could be arbitrary, but in typical cases they are not:
we assume that t ⊂ t̄ in the sense that any surrender time ti is contained in {t̄1 , . . . , t̄N }.
This is a very natural assumption since death of the policyholder might be monitored by
the insurer at the end of every month or every quarter, whereas surrender of the contract
might be allowed only at the end of each year during the life of the contract, or at the
policy anniversary.
The description of the contract benefits given above highlights the need for an accurate
financial model, but also an appropriate modelling for mortality risk and surrender risk.
This is offered in the rest of this section, which we conclude with the discussion of the
market consistent valuation of the VA.

7

3.1. Mortality model. For the modelling of mortality risk, we follow standard literature
in the field and adopt a stochastic intensity-based approach. Pioneered by Milevsky and
Promislow (2001), further developed by Dahl (2004), Dahl and Møller (2006), and more recently generalized by Li and Szimayer (2011), this framework builds on a given initial curve
for mortality rates by superimposing a stochastic process capturing random improvements
and fluctuations.
In details. Let τ m (x) be a random time capturing the remaining lifetime of a x years old
individual. The corresponding survival probability with respect to the given probability
measure is

 Rt m
Q (τ m (x) > t) = EQ e− 0 λu (x+u)du ,
where λm
t (x + t), t > 0, is the stochastic mortality intensity for an individual aged x + t at
time t. This intensity process is modelled as
m,0
λm
(x + t)ξt ,
t (x + t) = λ

(9)

for an initial curve of the mortality intensity, λm,0 , and a strictly positive process ξt such
that ξ0 = 1, capturing the mortality improvements from time 0 to time t for a person aged
m,0 (x) (see Dahl
x + t. Finally, the mortality intensity satisfies the property that λm
0 (x) = λ
and Møller, 2006 and references therein for full details).
A popular choice for the initial mortality curve is represented by the Gompertz-Makeham
model (Dahl, 2004, Dahl and Møller, 2006, for example). An alternative specification corresponding to the structure for the UK standard tables for annuitant and pension population
is adopted in Ballotta and Haberman (2006). Numerous choices for the process of the
mortality improvement ratio, ξt , have been put forward as well: Dahl (2004), Biffis (2005),
Dahl and Møller (2006) for example focus on affine diffusion specifications with particular
emphasis on time-inhomogeneous CIR processes; Ballotta and Haberman (2006) instead
extend the generalized linear model by superimposing a standard mean reverting OrnsteinUhlenbeck process and suitably accommodating longevity effects.
In light of the above, in the following we choose the standard Gompertz-Makeham model
for the initial curve, so that
1 x+t−z
λm,0 (x + t) = e( b ) ,
b
and an extended Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with mean reversion level e−λt for the mortality improvement ratio as in Krayzler et al. (2016), i.e.
dξ(t) = κ(exp(−λt) − ξ(t))dt + σdWt .
We assume that W is a Brownian motion independent of (L1 , L2 ), z, κ and σ are nonnegative, b is positive and λ ∈ R. This implies that the mortality intensity is independent
of the financial market.

8

A few considerations are in order. Firstly, as ξ is modelled as a Gaussian OrnsteinUhlenbeck process, the mortality intensity can become negative with positive probability.
However, this probability is negligible (less than 10−5 ) as shown in Appendix A.2. in
Escobar et al. (2016). For the occurring difficulties with negative values in the intensity,
see for example Bielecki and Rutkowski (2002), Lemma 9.1.4 and the related remarks.
Secondly, the above assumption of independence between the mortality risk driver, W , and
the financial risk drivers, L1 and L2 , is plausible from the perspective of the insurer: precise
modelling would be highly client-specific, and would require information rarely accessible
by insurance companies. Moreover, the independence assumption implies a high degree of
tractability which is important for complex products such as VAs considered here.
Finally, as a consequence of the independence between demographic and financial risks,
the computation of the survival probability is carried out under the risk neutral measure Q.
For specific considerations about the interaction between mortality risk and market risk,
we refer the interested reader to Dahl and Møller (2006) and references therein.
3.2. Surrender model. Surrender risk is notoriously difficult to assess and model due to
the nature of the decisions leading to it. Policyholders can indeed surrender both because
of rising alternative financial opportunities, and apparently non rational (in the financial
sense) behaviours due to personal considerations and contingencies. Nevertheless, surrender
represents one of the main risks faced by life insurance companies due to the liquidity issues
it can generate, with potential loss of market share (see, for example, Loisel and Milhaud,
2011, and references therein).
A common market and academic practice to surrender modelling (see Kolkiewicz and
Tan, 2006, Le Courtois and Nakagawa, 2011, Ducuroir et al., 2016, for example) is to
consider two components: a deterministic baseline hazard rate function capturing lapses1
due to non-economic factors, and a stochastic process representing additional shocks to the
baseline due to changes in the market.
This random component is usually linked to the spread between the return offered by the
contract and the one offered on the market for equivalent products. Indeed, dependence
of the surrender on interest rates is relatively intuitive: higher interest rates are strong
incentives for the policyholder to switch to higher yield investments, whilst very low interest rates - such as the ones currently observed in all major economies - could represent
advantageous opportunities for refinancing. The random component should also be linked
to the change in value of the underlying asset, as it directly impacts on the amount received
in case of surrender.
Thus, following this line of reasoning, let τ s denote the random time of the policyholder decision to surrender. As specified above, surrender is allowed at time points ti ,
i = 1, . . . , K − 1; by convention {τ s = ∞} corresponds to no surrender. Let λs denote the
corresponding intensity of surrender; then λs (t) = 0 for t ∈ [0, t1 ) ∪ [tK , T ]. Further, we
model the baseline surrender behaviour due to non-economic factors and personal contingencies by a non-negative constant C.
1‘Lapse’ was originally used to denote termination of an insurance policy and loss of coverage because the

policyholder had failed to pay premia, whilst ‘surrender’ denotes termination accompanied by the payout of
a surrender benefit. Nowadays ‘lapse’ often denotes both situations.

9

Let D(t) be the process driving the dynamic lapse component; consistently with the
considerations offered above, we build this process on the spread between the return offered
by the surrender benefit (net of any penalty charge) plus the market rates at which this
amount can be invested, and the total yield of the policy represented by the value at
maturity of the guaranteed amount. Thus, let Yt = log St , and p(t) = − log P (t). Then
Z T
f (t, s)ds − δT, 0 ≤ t ≤ T.
(11)
D(t) = Yt − p(t) +
t

The overall surrender intensity consequently is defined as
λs (t) = βD2 (ti ) + C,

ti ≤ t < ti+1 ,

(12)

so that it is piecewise constant on the interval [ti , ti+1 ) for i = 1, . . . , K − 1.
The non-negative constant β captures the dependence between the surrender intensity
and the market and is a measure of the investors’ rationality (in the pure economic sense),
and their response to personal financial motivations. Equation (12) uses the square of
the spread function D(t) in order to capture both situations of favourable market conditions offering more remunerative investment opportunities, and financial market turmoils
in which policyholders might lack sufficient resources to finance their expenses (emergency
fund hypothesis).
Although in spirit similar to others in the literature (see for example Le Courtois and
Nakagawa, 2011 and Escobar et al., 2016), our construction distinguishes itself also for the
non-Gaussian dynamics of the underpinning risk drivers L1 and L2 .
The resulting probability of no surrender is given by

can be obtained in a doubly-stochastic model or in a model where immersion holds, see
Aksamit and Jeanblanc (2017) for a comprehensive treatment in this regard. An alternative
form of the intensity is investigated in the Appendix A.
Finally, we observe that the intensity functions λs and λm are independent due to the
assumed independence between demographic and financial risks.

3.3. The price of the variable annuity. Using the notation introduced above, we can
now formulate the actual cash-flows associated with the considered variable annuity. Firstly,
recall that the GMAB provides a payoff only at the maturity time T if the policyholder
is alive (i.e., {τ m (x) > T }) and if there was no surrender until this time (i.e., {τ s > T }).
Consequently, the associated cash-flow at maturity T is
GMAB(T ) = 1{τ m (x)>T } 1{τ s >T } max(IST , G(T )).

(15)

10

Secondly, the surrender option can be exercised only once if the policyholder is still alive
(i.e., {τ s < τ m (x)}). Therefore, should surrender occur, the surrender benefit at time ti
pays
SB(ti ) = 1{τ s =ti } 1{τ s <τ m (x)} ISti P (ti ),
(16)
where ti is one of the possible premature surrender dates. Finally, the death benefit provides
a payoff only in case of no early surrender, and is quantified as
DB(t̄i ) = 1{t̄i−1 ≤τ m (x)<t̄i } 1{τ m (x)<τ s } max(IS(t̄i ), G(t̄i )),

(17)

where t̄i is one of the possible payoff dates of the death benefit.
The price PVA of the variable annuity at time t = 0 is equal to the sum of the prices of
its constituents, i.e.
PVA = PGMAB + PSB + PDB ,

To ensure integrability, we define g(x1 , . . . , xK ) := F (x1 , . . . , xK )e−rxK , with 1 < r < 2.
Further, let

Then, gK ∈ L1 (R), such that g ∈ L1 (RK ). Moreover, elementary integration shows that

Observe that |ĝK (y)|C = (((1 − r)2 + y 2 )(r2 + y 2 ))−1/2 , thus, ĝK ∈ L1 (R). Therefore,

5. Numerical implementation and testing
This section discusses the numerical computation of the pricing equations in Theorems
4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, based on the model features introduced in section 2. For the purpose of
the numerical analysis, we choose as a relevant Lévy process the Normal Inverse Gaussian
(NIG) process introduced by Barndorff-Nielsen (1997) with cumulant function

p
p
θ(u) = µu + δ
α2 − β 2 − α2 − (β + u)2 , −α − β < u < α − β,
for µ ∈ R, δ > 0, 0 ≤ |β| < α. The parameter α controls the steepness of the density
(and therefore its tail behaviour), β primarily controls the (sign of the) skewness of the
distribution, whilst δ is the scale parameter; the location parameter µ is instead set to zero,
without loss of generality.
Further, we assume a simplified Vasiček structure for the function σ1 (s, T ) so that for
a>0
(
ae−a(T −s) , s ≤ T
σ1 (s, T ) =
0,
s>T
and

(
Σ(s, T ) =

1 − e−a(T −s) , s ≤ T
.
0,
s>T

For the equity part, we assume σ2 (s) = σ2 > 0 and β(s) = b ∈ R. All numerical experiments refer to contracts with a parameter setting as in Table 1; the parameters of the
financial model are taken from the calibration exercise of Eberlein and Rudmann (2018).

Figure 1. N (u, T ), T = 3 years (K = 2). Left panel: real part of the function
N (u, T ). Right panel: imaginary part of N (u, T ). Parameters: Table 1.

The short maturity contracts are used for benchmarking purposes, whilst the 10 year maturity contract represents a realistic specification for practical purposes. Concerning the
possible termination dates, for illustration purposes we use a 1 year frequency, i.e. ∆tl = 1,
whilst the time grid for mortality, which is assumed to have finer granularity, is built with a
frequency of 6 months. We note though that the results obtained in Theorems 4.1, 4.2 and
4.3 hold for any choice of the relevant time steps. The numerical schemes are implemented
in Matlab R2018a and run on a computer with an Intel i5-6500, 3.20 gigahertz CPU,
and 8 gigabytes of RAM.
5.1. Implementation. The multidimensional integrals in Theorems 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 are
computed by means of Monte Carlo integration (see for example Pharr and Humphreys,
2010, and references therein). Thus, the Monte Carlo estimate of a high-dimensional integral
over the domain Ω
Z
I=
f (x)dx

is obtained by evaluating the function f (x) at M points x, drawn randomly in Ω with a
given probability density p(x), so that

as in standard Monte Carlo simulation; this point shows that the rate of convergence
is independent of the dimensionality of the integrand, which is the advantage of Monte
Carlo integration compared to standard numerical quadrature techniques in computing
high-dimensional integrals.
Classical Monte Carlo integration uses the uniform probability density. However, visual
inspection of the integrand functions M (u, T ) and N (u, T ) of Theorem 4.1 reveals that
M (u, T ) is strongly peaked around the origin, whilst N (u, T ) is characterised by alternations

of peaks and troughs of significant magnitude - as shown in Figure 1 for T = 3 (K = 2).
Similar considerations hold for the integrand functions in Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, due to
the similarities between the corresponding payoff functions. These features, in general, can
induce large variances in the Monte Carlo estimate of the corresponding integral.
Consequently, for variance reduction purposes and in order to speed up convergence, we
implement importance sampling; in details, given that the integrand functions are strongly
peaked around the origin, the importance distribution of choice is the multivariate Gaussian
distribution with zero mean (i.e. centered around the peak), independent components, and
a given variance matrix, which is treated as a parameter. Full deployment of the pricing
algorithm in the setting of VEGAS and MISER Monte Carlo integration is left to future
research.
5.2. Benchmarking and Testing. Numerical results for the pricing functions considered
in this paper are reported in Table 2 and 3. In order to provide a reliable benchmark
for the Monte Carlo integration procedure introduced above, we consider first some simple
examples for which the relevant multidimensional integrals can be tackled with standard
quadrature packages. We illustrate the results obtained for the case of the GMAB. Similar
performances are obtained for the DB and the SB as well, and we refer the interested reader
to the Appendix D for more details.
In details. Table 2 reports values obtained with deterministic quadrature methods, the
corresponding estimate from Monte Carlo integration, and the CPU time. Together with
the Monte Carlo estimate, IM C , we also report measures of its accuracy in terms of the
absolute value of the bias of the estimator expressed as percentage of the value obtained
by quadrature IQ , i.e.
|IM C − IQ |

For increased reliability of the estimate of the CPU time, we base the numerical experiment
on 100 repetitions of the Monte Carlo algorithm with sample size 106 .
We consider two examples for a contract with maturity T = 3 years (i.e. K = 2) and
T = 4 years (i.e. K = 3) respectively. With annually spaced termination dates ti , these
choices imply that A1 and A2 are respectively one- and two-dimensional integrals in the
first case, and two- and three-dimensional integrals in the second case, which can also be
computed using packages for deterministic quadrature methods.
For importance sampling, numerical experiments show that relatively small biases and
standard errors can be obtained by using the same variance fixed at 0.25 for the first K − 1
dimensions, and increasing this value to 1 for the last K th dimension, as to cater for the
higher variability of the integrand function N (u, T ). The results in Table 2 confirm the
quality of the estimates as all biases and standard errors are below 0.5%.
The value of the VA together with its components are reported in Table 3. We observe
that the GMAB value decreases with increasing maturities, due to the larger number of
dates at which the contract can be terminated by either death or surrender of the policyholder. Consistently with these findings, we also observe the increase in the value of
both the DB and the SB for contracts with longer maturities. The overall value of the VA
increases as well with longer maturities, denoting the dominant impact of the DB and the
SB components.
Finally, we observe the higher computational cost of the DB and SB parts of the full
variable annuity; this is due to the large number of integrals of the cumulant functions of
interest (see definitions (34) and (35)) be computed. This number depends on the granularity of both the t and t̄ grids: the finer these grids, the more computational demanding
these components of the contract become.

left-hand-side - GMAB; right-hand-side: SB. Bottom panels: left-hand-side - DB;
right-hand-side - VA. Maturity: T = 10 years. Other parameters: Table 1.

6. Results: Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity analysis is carried out by perturbing the parameters of interest one at
a time, ceteris paribus. The benchmark case is given by a 10 years contract with the
parameters set as in Table 1.
In Figure 2 we show the sensitivity of the VA and its components to the parameters
β and C, controlling the surrender intensity. Consistently with intuition, the higher the
value of β, the stronger the influence of the financial market on the policyholder decision to
surrender. This is captured in particular by the value of the surrender benefit, SB, which
increases with β. Due to the higher surrender probability, the values of the GMAB and the
DB reduce, and so does the resulting value of the VA.
The impact of the parameter β though becomes less relevant in correspondence of higher
values of the constant C which represents the baseline surrender behaviour. In this case,
the non-economic factors leading to the decision of surrender dominate the influence of the
financial market to the point that the VA as well as its components are almost insensitive
to β.
These results highlight that a correct quantification of the baseline surrender parameter
C is of paramount importance given the significant impact on the value of the VA and
its components. In this respect, it is crucial for insurance companies to correctly calibrate
the surrender model to the information that they could collect regarding the policyholder
behaviour towards lapses.

panels: left-hand-side - GMAB; right-hand-side: SB. Bottom panels: left-hand-side
- DB; right-hand-side - VA. Maturity: T = 10 years. Other parameters: Table 1.

26

Figure 3 shows that the impact of the parameter β is also affected by the dependence
between the equity and the fixed income markets, here captured by the parameter b. Indeed,
in presence of explicit dependence between the financial markets (i.e. b 6= 0), the behaviour
of the policyholders becomes more responsive to changes in the market conditions. This is
reflected in the rate of change of the contract’s value.
Finally, in Figure 4 we illustrate the behaviour of the contract with respect to the guaranteed rate δ. A higher value of this rate corresponds to a more valuable VA, as one would
expect; the SB though is relatively insensitive to δ, also due to the low values of the latter
used in this analysis.
7. Conclusion
We proposed a general framework for the valuation of a number of guarantees commonly
included in variable annuity products, such as guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit,
death benefit and surrender benefit, in the setting of a hybrid model based on multivariate
Lévy processes, with surrender risk captured endogenously.
This framework proves to be tractable, and allows for the deployment of efficient numerical schemes based on Monte Carlo integration. We used this setting to gain insights
into the contract sensitivity with respect to the model parameters, with special focus on
surrender risk. The emphasis on surrender in particular finds its motivation in the large
percentage of early terminations experienced by the insurance companies issuing variable
annuities, and the resulting net cash outflow they sustain as a consequence (as also pointed
out by LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute and IRI). The results obtained in our analysis
confirm the importance of the surrender behaviour and its appropriate modelling.
We envisage the applicability of the model setup offered in this paper, and the proposed numerical scheme, also for other benefits offered by VAs, such as the post-retirement
guaranteed minimum income benefit. This would represent a promising route for further
research.

Appendix A. An alternative specification for the surrender intensity
The surrender intensity λs is defined in (12) by
λs (t) = βD2 (ti ) + C = W1 (D(ti )), ti ≤ t < ti+1

(43)

where W1 (x) := βx2 + C. Consequently W1 (x) → ∞ as |x| → ∞. One might be interested
in the behaviour of the contract price for a surrender intensity whose values do not become
arbitrarily large. Therefore, in the following we study the valuation of the variable annuity’s
components under an alternative specification which keeps the surrender intensity bounded.

27

We start with an observation concerning the behaviour of D(ti ), i = 1, . . . , K − 1. The
following lemma shows that these quantities stay in a bounded interval with high probability. Based on this fact, Proposition A.2 and its corollary show that the contract values
obtained with the alternative surrender intensity approximate the values under the original
assumption.

where the last quantities are finite due to (4) and (7). Therefore, Ci := E T (eD(ti ) ) is finite,

i=1 (Ci + Ci )),
S
QT ( K−1

By similar arguments, we can prove that for any j ∈ {1, . . . , K − 1}, there exists L̂j > 0,
S
such that QS,j ( ji=1 {|D(ti )| > L̂j }) ≤ . We can prove also that for j ∈ {1, . . . , K − 2} and

28

any i such that tj < t̄i ≤ tj+1 , and for j = K − 1 and any i such that tK−1 < t̄i ≤ T , there
S
exists Li,j such that Qt̄i ( jl=1 {|D(tl )| > Li,j }) ≤ . Therefore, by defining L̄ := max(i,j) Li,j
and L := max(L1 , L̂1 , . . . , L̂K−1 , L̄), we deduce that (44) holds true.


Remark A.1. The constant L in Lemma A.1 depends on  and should be denoted L but
we omit this notation for simplicity.

Based on the above, let us replace W1 by another positive and continuous function W2
which coincides with W1 on [−L, L], L as in Lemma A.1, is constant outside this compact
set on the positive half line and converges to 0 as x → −∞. Specifically, we define W2 as

with the constants β and C as in (12). The new surrender intensity λ̄s is defined as
λ̄s (t) = W2 (D(ti )), ti ≤ t < ti+1 ,

(46)

for i ∈ {1, . . . K − 1}, and λ̄s (t) = 0 for t ∈ [0, t1 ) ∪ [tK , T ]. Then, as we will see in Corollary
A.3, the corresponding prices, denoted by P̄GMAB , P̄DB and P̄SB , approximate PGMAB , PDB

,
where in (3) and (4) we have either j ∈ {1, . . . , K −2} and i such that tj < t̄i ≤ tj+1 ,
or j = K − 1 and i such that tK−1 < t̄i ≤ T ,
(5) |B̄j1 − Bj1 | ≤ 2, for j ∈ {2, . . . , K − 1},
(6) |B̄j2 − Bj2 | ≤ 2, for j ∈ {1, . . . , K − 1}.
A1 , A2 are given in (21), A1j,i , A2j,i in (52), and Bj1 , Bj2 are given in (38) and (39).
Proof. It suffices to prove (2) which is representative for the degree of sophistication. The
proofs of (1), (3), (4), (5) and (6) follow mutatis mutandis. From the definition of W1 given

(ex+p(t̄i ) − 1)+ e−rx . By Theorem 3.2 in Eberlein et al. (2010), we get

Appendix D. Further numerical results: benchmarking
In this Appendix, we provide full results from the benchmarking exercise of the Monte
Carlo integration pricing procedure.
From section 5, we recall that we consider contracts with short maturity, and surrender
frequency ∆tl = 1 year. In addition, we assume half-annually spaced t̄i for the mortality
monitoring.
Consequently, a sensible benchmarking exercise for the value of both the DB and the SB
with deterministic quadrature methods can be achieved by considering the 4 year maturity
contract, i.e. K = 3.
Starting with the value of the DB, the term A0,i in Theorem 4.2 is a 1-dimensional
integral for i = 1, . . . , N , which can be obtained by direct quadrature, and therefore is not
considered by this benchmarking exercise.
Monte Carlo integration is instead used to compute the remaining terms appearing in
Theorem 4.2, i.e. A11,i , A21,i , A12,i , which are two-dimensional integrals, and A22,i which is a
three-dimensional integral, for all i = 1, . . . , N . These are benchmarked against the values
obtained by deterministic quadrature procedures in Matlab.
For importance sampling, we choose the same values of the variance of the importance
sampling distribution as in the GMAB case, i.e. 0.25 for the first K − 1 dimensions and 1
for the final K th dimension. The quality of the estimate is confirmed by the negligible bias
and standard errors reported in Table 4.
Concerning the value of the SB, we notice that the first term in the sum defining P SB in
Theorem 4.3 is composed by a constant (B11 ) and a one-dimensional integral (B12 ), which
is obtained by deterministic quadrature; similarly to the previous case this term is not
considered in this analysis. The second term in this sum is instead formed by a one- and
a two-dimensional integral (B21 and B22 respectively) for which we deploy Monte Carlo
integration. Benchmarking is performed against the corresponding quadrature routines in
Matlab.
For importance sampling, given the relatively simple forms of the integrand functions,
we use the same variance fixed at 0.16 across all the K dimensions. The goodness of the
estimate is confirmed by the negligible bias and standard errors shown in Table 4.
