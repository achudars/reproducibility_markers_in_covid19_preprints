Abstract
Starting with the seminal work of Arkani-Hamed et al [1], in [2], the “Amplituhedron program”
was extended to analyzing (planar) amplitudes in massless φ4 theory. In this paper we show that the
program can be further extended to include φp (p > 4) interactions. We show that tree-level planar
amplitudes in these theories can be obtained from geometry of polytopes called accordiohedron which
naturally sits inside kinematic space. As in the case of quartic interactions the accordiohedron of a
given dimension is not unique, and we show that a weighted sum of residues of the canonical form
on these polytopes can be used to compute scattering amplitudes. We finally provide a prescription
to compute the weights and demonstrate how it works in various examples.

Introduction

In [1,3] a space-time independent formulation for scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM was proposed.
A key feature of this formulation was that scattering amplitudes were to be thought of as differential
forms rather than functions and it was shown that there is a precise connection between an object
called the amplituhedron living in an auxiliary space and planar scattering amplitudes in N =
4 SYM. It was further shown that unitarity and locality emerge quite naturally from geometric
properties of the amplituhedron. Understanding scattering amplitudes in terms on canonical form on
the amplituhedron makes the dual conformal symmetry manifest and has already produced striking
results regarding positivity properties of the amplitudes as well as computational simplification for
higher loop amplitudes [4, 5].
Recently Arkani-Hamed et al [1] extended this formulation to non-supersymmetric domain by
analysing tree-level amplitudes of bi-adjoint scalar φ3 theory. A precise connection was established
between a polytope called the associahedron and scattering amplitude of the theory. It was shown
that associahedron (which is a combinatorial polytope) can be embedded as a convex polytope in the
kinematic space and the canonical form associated to it is the scattering form for φ3 theory. It was
also shown that various properties like soft limits and recursion relations of scattering amplitudes
could be obtained from geometric properties of the associahedron. This formulation was further
extended to include 1-loop amplitudes in bi-adjoint φ3 theory [6, 7].
A natural question to ask is for what class of theories such a formulation exists. In particular for theories containing independent quartic and higher order vertices, does this picture relating
scattering amplitudes to differential forms and convex polytopes continues to hold. First step in
this direction was taken in [2] where it was shown that for tree-level planar amplitudes in φ4 theory
such a formulation does indeed exist. It was established in [2] that there is a relationship between
the scattering amplitude, scattering forms and objects called Stokes polytope. There were however
important structural differences between the amplituhedron/associahedron picture and the picture
that emerged in the case of quartic interactions. Namely, for an n-particle scattering, the corresponding geometry was a union of many polytopes of a given dimension and one had to account for
all of them to capture complete tree-level planar scattering amplitude.
In this paper, we extend these ideas to all φp theories by establishing a connection between
unique planar scattering forms and convex polytopes called accordiohedron. We also show that
(just as in the case of cubic and quartic interactions), geometric realisation of accordiohedron inside
the kinematic space leads one to identify scattering amplitudes in such theories with canonical top

forms of the accordiohedron.
One of the key motivations for our work (apart from it’s intrinsic interest in developing the
Amplituhedron program further) was already outlined in [2] and arises from trying to better understand the CHY formulation for φp theories [8, 9]. Unlike bi-adjoint scalar field theory, or Yang-Mills
theory the CHY integrands associated to φp theories are not d-log forms and hence do not seem to
have a clear geometric meaning in terms of forms on the moduli space. Our hope is that by first
understanding the structure of such forms in kinematic space, we may be able to better understand
CHY formula for such theories.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In section (2) we define the notion Q-Compatibility
and use it to define the accordiohedron for φp interactions. In section (3) we explain how to embed
the accordiohedron in kinematic space and how to obtain the scattering amplitude from the accordiohedron by intorducing primitives and weights to simplify our computations. In section(4) we
derive a formula for the number of primitves of a given dimension n and provide a classification all
primitves up to n ≤ 3, we also provide general prescription for determining the weights. In section
(5) we prove factorization for accordiohedra and also discuss the role of factorisation in determining
the weights. We finally end with some conclusions and future directions.

Amplitudes and Accordiohedron

We shall begin by defining an object called the accordiohedron [10, 11] associated with general dissections of polygons. We shall then show how this reduces to the associahedron and Stokes polytopes [1, 2] for cubic and quartic interactions respectively. We shall then argue that the accordiohedron is thus the natural candidate for the positive geometry of all φp interactions with p ≥ 3.

2.1

Accordion lattices and Accordiohedra

Let A be a convex polygon. Let us consider the division of A into identical p-gons which we call
p-angulation of A. We can represent A as a set of points on the unit circle oriented clockwise where
the arcs represent edges of A and chords represent diagonals of A. The simplest example is the case
where we divide (2p−2)-gon A into two p-gons (see figure (1)). There are p−1 possible p-angulations
which correspond to having the diagonals {(1, p), (2, p + 1), · · · , (p − 1, 2p − 2)}. We define a notion

(i, j) → (M od(i + p − 2, 2p − 2), M od(j + p − 2, 2p − 2))

(1)

We can use this rule to define accordion lattices ALPp,n of dimension n associated with a reference
p -angulation P

2

as follows:

• We can start with any p-angulation P of a convex polygon with n diagonals.
• In the first step for each of the n diagonals, we go to the unique (2p − 2)-gon which contains
it and replace it with its Q-compatible diagonal.
• In the second step for each of the n p-angulations at the end of step one we choose one of the
original n − 1 diagonals and replace it with its Q-compatible diagonal as in step one.
• We repeat this till none of the original n diagonals remain in step n.
This generates a graph3 which is the 1-skeleton of a convex polytope called the Accordiohedron [10,11],
P 4
which we shall also call ACp,n
.
1

In [10, 11] there is different definition of compatability, but these two definitions can be shown to be equivalent
to each other and we shall use the definition (1) as its most suited for our purposes. We thank Alok Laddha for
explaining this fact to us.
2
We consider only the case where we divide the polygon into p-gons in this paper, but accordion lattices are defined
for arbitrary dissections.
3
More precisely one can define a partial order on the the set of all p-angulations that can be obtained from a
particular p-angulation P, which has a maximal and a minimal element (P itself) thus making it lattice and this
procedure generates the Hasse diagram of the lattice
4
Interestingly enough, there is yet another, “complimentary” family of polytopes known as graph associahedra [12]
which also had deep connections with geometry of scattering amplitudes. In contrast to accordiohedron, graph associahedra can not always be obtained by considering dissections of polygons. graph associahedra is a set of polytopes
which includes, associahedron, permutahedron, halohedron etc. Many of these members, e.g. permutahedron and
halohedron are associated to amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory with non-planar [13] and 1-loop amplitudes [7]
respectively. It is intriguing that one class of polytopes helps one to move beyond tree-level and planarity in bi-adjoint
φ3 theories and the other class helps one move beyond cubic vertices.

Figure 2: accordiohedra for the n=2 case. The red circles indicate the reference p-angulations.
In the case of cubic interactions (p = 3), (1) reduces to (i, j) → (M od(i + 1, 4), M od(j + 1, 4))
P
which is the usual mutation rule and the resulting accordiohedron AC3,n
is the associahedron [1].

In the case of quartic interactions (p = 4), (1) reduces to (i, j) → (M od(i + 2, 6), M od(j + 2, 6))
P
which was the Q compatibility rule defined in [14] and the accordiohedron AC4,n
was shown to be
the Stokes polytope [2].
P
Thus the Accordiohedra ACp,n
are a general class of polytopes which contain both associahedron

and Stokes polytopes as special cases when the p-angulations corresponds to triangulations and
P
quadrangulations respectively. The accordiohedra ACp,n
with p > 4 also retains many of the features
of the Stokes polytopes we had discussed earlier in [2] including the fact that the accordiohedron
P
ACp,n
of a given dimension n is not unique and depends on the reference p-angulation P, which is

6

due to the fact that (1) is not an equivalence relation as (1, p) → (p − 1, 2p − 2), but (p − 1, 2p − 2) →
(p − 2, 2p − 3) 6= (1, p) except when p = 3.
P
is independent of P , as every diagonal is
The case p = 3 is special in this sense as for AC3,n
Q-compatible with every other diagonal and thus we could start with any triangulation P and we

would generate all possible triangulations.
The accordiohedron obtained by starting with a particular p-angulation is also completely determined by the relative configuration of diagonals.5
(i,p+i)
The n = 1 accordiohedron ACp,1
are lines with vertices (i, p + i) and (M od(i + p − 2, 2p −
2), M od(i + 2p − 2, 2p − 2)) for i = 1, ..., p − 1.
The n = 2 case the accordiohedron can be either pentagons or squares depending on whether
the two diagonals meet or don’t meet respectively (see fig(2)) just as in the case of Stokes polytopes.
(Q)
(P )
In other words ACp,2 ≡ AC4,2 for all p provided both P and Q have the same configuration of
diagonals, we shall prove this in a later section (4.3) by establishing the precise maps between vertices
of the Stokes polytope and that of the accordiohedron.
The n = 3 case the accordiohedra continue to be one of the four n = 3 Stokes polytopes with
(Q)
(P )
different multiplicities, i.e., ACp,3 ≡ AC4,3 for all p provided P and Q have the same configuration
of diagonals. We elaborate on this in section (4.4). We expect that at higher n new polytopes which
are not one of the Stokes polytopes will be eventually generated.

Positive geometry for φp interactions

3

(P )

We would like to show that the accordiohedron ACp,n is the positive geometry associated to φp
interactions. We shall do this by first embedding the accordiohedron into kinematic space and then
showing that the canonical form of the accordiohedron when pulled back gives the right planar
scattering amplitude for φp interactions. We start by noting the following facts:
• The only tree level amplitudes consistent with φp interactions have p + (p − 2)n external legs
for n + 1 vertices.
• Analogously to the cubic and quartic cases there is a 1-1 correspondence between planar tree
level Feynman graphs and dissections of p + (p − 2)n- gon into p-gons.
5

From the perspective of Feynman graphs this is equivalent to saying that there is an accordiohedron for each
topological class of graphs.

7

(P )

• We also require the accordiohedron ACp,n to have dimension n, which is the number of propagators.6
We shall first introduce some notations and variables that we shall use to describe the kinematic
space.

3.1

Kinematic space

We shall primarily follow the conventions of [1] which we briefly summarise here.
The kinematic space Kn of n massless momenta in d dimensions (with n < d − 1) is spanned by
the Mandelstram variables:
sij = (pi + pj )2 ,

with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

that satisfy momentum conservation
n
X

sij = 0

j=1
j6=i

For any set of particle labels I ⊂ {1, 2, ..., n} we can define generalised Mandelstram variables as:
!2
sI =

X

pi

i∈I

=

X

sij

i,j∈I
i<j

A more convenient basis for the kinematic Kn for our purposes are the planar kinematic variables,
with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

Xij = si,i+1,...,j−1 ,
It is clear that Xi

i+1

= 0 and X1n = 0 due to masslessness and momentum conservation respectively.

The mandelstram variables sij can be written interns of planar variables Xij as
sij = Xi

j+1

+ Xi+1 j − Xi j − Xi+1

j+1

(2)

The planar variables Xij can be interpreted as the the length of a diagonal between vertices i and j
of an n-gon which has the momenta pi as sides.
6

This is because we require the top-form on the positive geometry, once embedded in kinematic space to produce
the right scattering amplitude.

8

3.2

Planar scattering form for φp interactions

We would like to define a planar scattering form for φp interactions. We can associate to each planar
graph g with propagators Xi1 j1 , Xi2 j2 · · · Xin jn a scattering form:
σ(g)
Qn
dXi1 j1 ∧ dXi2 j2 ∧ · · · ∧ dXin jn
k=1 Xik jk
where, σ(g) = ±1.
Thus, when we sum over all planar graphs g we have several possible scattering forms. Since we
do not have a notion of projectivity except in the case of p = 3 which helps us fix a unique scattering
form [1]. We can choose a particular reference graph g (equivalently a p-angulation P ) and look at
only those subset of graphs which are related to this graph by a sequence of Q-flips namely all the
vertices of the accordiohedron. If a graph g 0 is related to g by an odd (even) number of Q-flips we
can associate −(+) sign to it. Thus, we can define a p-angulation P dependent planar scattering
form ΩPn :
ΩPn =

X (−1)σ(f lip)
Qn
dXi1 j1 ∧ dXi2 j2 ∧ · · · ∧ dXin jn
k=1 Xik jk
f lips

Since, the Q-compatible p-angulations corresponding to any reference p-angulation P does not exhaust all the p-angulations, we need to define such a planar scattering form for each P .
In the n = 1 case the set of Q-compatible p-angulations are {(1 p; +), (p − 1 2p − 2; −)}, {(2 p +
1; +), (p 2p − 1; −)}, · · · , {(p − 1 2p − 2; +), (p − 2 2p − 3; −)}7 the planar scattering forms for which
are:
(ij)

Ω2p−2 = d ln Xi j − d ln Xi+p−2

j+p−2

where, i, j = 1, ..., p − 1 modulo (2p − 2) with |i − j| = p − 1.
We now turn to embedding the accordiohedron in kinematic space and showing that when the
planar scattering form is pulled back onto the accordiohedron it gives the canonical form of the
accordiohedron.

3.3

Locating the accordiohedron inside kinematic space
(P )

We now define the kinematic accordiohedron ACp,n . We locate the accordiohedron inside the positive
region of kinematic space Xij > 0 for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ p + (p − 2)n by imposing the following
Here the signs denote (−1)σ(f lip) , when we have multiple diagonals we need to carefully maintain the order of
diagonals when we flip as it contibutes to the sign.

constraints:
sij = − cij ;

f or 1 ≤ i < j ≤ p − 1 + (p − 2)n, |i − j| ≥ 2

Xri si = dri si ; s.t. P ∪ni=1 {(ri , si )} is a complete triangulation

(3)

where cij , dri si are positive constants.8
Physically we choose the above set of constraints as they do not appear as propagators of any
φp graph. The first constraint above is the famous associahedron embedding [1]. We have thus
embedded the accordiohedron inside the associahedron. The positivity of Xij ’s, the above constraints
along with the equation (2) are a set of inequalities satisfied by the Xij which makes the convexity
of the accodiohedron manifest.
We first consider the n = 1 case with the reference p-angulation to be P = {(1, p)} for p = 5, 6.
For p = 5, 6 we can choose ∪i {ri si } to be {24, 25, 17, 57} and {35, 36, 26, 17, 19, 79} respectively.
The above constraints then translate to:

In the case when p = 4 that is when the Accordiohedron is a Stokes polytope, there is a canonical choice for the
additional constraints if the Stokes polytope is itself not an Associahedron [2]. However for p > 4 we do not have
any canonical choice of these constraints. As we show in this section, there is at least one choice which consistently
embeds the Accordiohedron in the Kinematic space.
9
Since we are slicing the associahedron using some hyperplanes Xri si = dri si to get the accordiohedron these
constraints tell us how the slicing should be made. For higher n we shall not state these constraints for brevity but
we shall assume that they are satisfied.

10

The above equations define lines with Q-compatible vertices {15, 48} and {16, 510} for p = 5 and
p = 6 respectively. We can trivially repeat this exercise for any other reference p-angulation P =
{i, i + p}, the results of which can be obtained by taking k → k + i − 1 in the above equations. We
P
can now pull back the scattering form onto the accordiohedron ACp,n
as:

Thus, we can simplify our computation by considering a subset of p-angulations {P1 , . . . , PI }
called primitive p-angulations for which:
(a) no two members of the set are related to each other by cyclic permutations and
(b) all the other p-angulations can be obtained by a (sequence of ) cyclic permutations of one of
the P s belonging to the set.
The primitives are the class of rotationally inequivalent diagrams. Since, a rotation does not
change the relative configuration of diagonals it is clear that accodiohedra remain the same for all
the diagrams that belong to a primitive class and that the weights depend only on primitives. We
shall say more about primitives in section (4).

For now let us look at a couple of examples to see how finding primitive accordiohedra and their

In the n = 1 case above there was only one primitive P = {(1, p)}.
We consider the n = 2 case for p = 5, 6 for which we now have the set of primitives as (see figure(2)) {(15, 610), (15, 18)} and {(16, 914), (16, 110), (16, 813)} respectively. The set of Q-compatible

p-angulations for these are:
p = 5 : S51 = {(15, 711; +), (411, 711; −), (15, 610; −), (411, 610; +)},
S52 = {(15, 18; +), (18, 48; −), (15, 711; −), (411, 711; +), (411, 48; +)}

Analysing the combinatorics of Accordiohedra

Both in [2] and in the present case, a complete computation of the amplitude from the geometry of
the polytope requires determination of all the primitives of a given dimension n and computation
of the corresponding weights. We shall address the problem in this section. We emphasise that
this a purely combinatorial problem and hence does not depend on the construction of kinematic
space accordiohedron. In sections (4.1) ,(4.2) we shall first derive formulae to count the number of
primitive accordiohedra of a given dimension n. Then in sections (4.3) ,(4.4) we provide a complete
classification of primitive accordiohedra for n ≤ 3 and compute the corresponding weights for any
φp interactions. Let us first consider the quartic case.

4.1

Counting primitives for the quartic case

In this section we shall address the quartic case first and provide a formula for the number of
primitive Stokes polytopes pn of a given dimension n. The main result of this section is:

1
1
, n = 2k + 1

 2n+4 Fn+1 + 2 F n+1

Fn+1 + 14 F̃ n2 , n = 2k with k odd

 1
F
+ 12 F n4 , n = 4k
2n+4 n+1
We shall now prove this result.
2πi
We shall consider a (4 + 2n)-gon as equally spaced points ai on the circle i.e. ai = exp 4+2n
with
i = 0, ..., 2n + 3. The edges of the polygon correspond to arcs ai ai+1 on the circle and the diagonals
of a quadrangulation correspond to chords.
There is a natural action of the dihedral group D2n+4 on any given quadrangulation which
is generated by rotation and reflections about a given diagonal. We are interested in counting
primitive quadrangulations, no two of which are related to each other by a cyclic permutation, which
corresponds to a rotation on the circle. Thus, it is sufficient to consider only the cyclic group Z2n+4
for our purposes. The problem of counting primitive quadrangulations is thus equivalent to finding
the number orbits of the set of all quadrangulations of a (4 + 2n)-gon under the action of the cyclic
group Z2n+4 .
We shall do this by using the celebrated Burnside’s lemma, which is the standard way to count
the number of orbits G/GX for the action of any finite group G on a set X. It states that the
number of orbits is equal to the average number of points that remain invariant when acted on by

14

elements of G.
|G/GX | =

1 X
|{e ∈ X| g.e = e}|
|G| g ∈ G

(6)

Thus, to count the number of primitive quadrangulations we just need to find the subset of
quadrangulations that are invariant under some rotation. This problem has been addressed by [15]
using the method of generating functions, but we shall take a simpler approach here following [16].
We can consider the division of (2n + 4)-gon into n + 1 quadrilaterals. We first note that the
A

centre of the circle is left invariant by the action of the cyclic group Z2n+4 . The centre of the circle
can lie on:
A
(1) A diameter. This can only happen when n is odd since, the relative angle between the end
points ai , aj of this diameter has to π.

A

(2) The midpoint of an invariant cell i.e. on the point of intersection of the diagonals of a centre
square which remains invariant.
In case (1) the diameter forms an axis of symmetry and has to be left invariant by rotations and
it is clear that the only possible rotation which does this is by π and the quadrangulation Q consists
of a left and a right part where the left part is a rotation of the right one.( see figure(3) ).
A
In case (2) the diagonals can either be rotated to themselves
or into each other. This Acan only be
π
accomplished by rotations of π, ± 2 and the corresponding quadrangulations are shown in the figure

(3).

correspond to Fk1 and Fk−k1 respectively. The total number of such quadrangulations would then be

k1 =0 Fk1 Fk−k1 and since there are 2 ways we can relabel the invariant square. Using the following

When n = 4k we have F n4 subquadrangulations A as shown in figure (3). There are also (n + 2)
ways to relabel the invariant cell and thus there are a total of (n + 2)F n4 quadrangulations that are
invariant under a rotation by ± π2 . Thus, after also including the identity rotation which leaves all
the elements invariant we get the total number of primitive quadrangulations pn is given by:

1, 2, 7, 30 for n = 1, 2, 3, 4. The set of invariant quadrangulations is shown in the figure (4) below.

counting primitives for φp case

We shall now extend our analysis for the quartic case to any general p and provide a formula for the
number of primitive accordiohedra of dimension n. The number of primitives p-angulations of an
(p − 2)n + p-gon is the same as the number of orbits of the cyclic group Z(p−2)n+p when it acts on
the set of all p-angulations. There number of such orbits can be straightforwardly computed from
Burnside’s lemma just as we had done in (4.1). We proceed analogously to the quartic case (4.1)
by noting that the centre of the circle is invariant under any rotation and can lie:
(1) On a diameter, this happens only when n is odd and leaves the p-angulation invariant under
a rotation by π (see figure (5)).
(2) Inside an invariant cell, in this case we have p-angulations for every d | Gcd(p, n) which is
invariant under rotation by

2π
d

(see figure (5) ).

The total number of p-angulations
of an (p − 2)n + p-gon into (n + 1) p-gons is given by the Fuss

To determine the weights we would need to actually identify the primitive accordiohedra, then
we need to find all the vertices of the accordiohedra starting with these primitives as the reference
p-angulations. There is no general classification for primitives of an arbitrary dimension n to our
knowledge since they grow as pn . We provide a complete classification for n ≤ 3 and give the
compute the corresponding weights.

4.3

primitives and weights for n = 2 case

We would like to provide the details of the primitives and weights for φp interactions for the n = 2
( 2d case). In this case there are 3 vertices with 3p − 4 legs. We could try to recursively construct
these graphs from the n = 1 graphs. So without loss of generality we consider only Feynman graphs
in which two of the vertices lie in a line as shown in the figure(6). The 3rd vertex can then be made
to lie on the central line connecting the first two vertices and it can be either above or below this
line. These graphs can be denoted as (k1 , k2 ) such that k1 + k2 = p − 2, where the 3rd vertex has k1
legs above and k2 legs below the central line.
Since, we are only interested in primitives the graphs for which 3rd vertices are (k1 , k2 ) and
(k2 , k1 ) correspond to the same primitive graph. Thus, without loss of generality we can choose
the diagrams in which the 3rd vertex has more legs above the central vertex than below it to be
   p−2 
primitive graphs namely (p − 2, 0), (p − 3, 1),..., ( p−2
, 2 ). We shall call them [1],[2],...,[k],
2
p
where k = 2 .
The primitives are all shown in the above figure(6). We shall now show that these are the only
primitives. It is clear that all the graphs above are inequivalent under cyclic permutations. As
explained earlier the total number of such graphs is given by the Fuss-Catalan number

3(p − 1)
(p − 1)(3p − 4)

We shall show that if we perform the channel sum starting with these primitives we generate all
the graphs. A cyclic permutation corresponds to a clockwise rotation of the labels and every graph
returns to itself after a rotation of period 3p − 4 but a graph for which the 3rd vertex is symmetric
about the central line returns to itself after only half a rotation i.e has a period

3p−4
.

The only such

graph is the last graph in the case when p = 2k. Thus, the total number of graphs generated by

which agrees with our results from (7). As

explained in the previous subsection the accordiohedra generated by starting with a particular graph
(or p-angulation ) depends only on the relative configuration of the diagonals and in this case since
there are 2 diagonals the only possibilities are:
1. The diagonals meet as in [1], in this case the accordiohedron is an associahedron An .(see (2))
2. The diagonals do not meet as in [2],... ,[k], in all these other cases the accordiohedron turns
out to be a square.
P

We can provide a mapping between the vertices of the Stokes polytope AC4,2
and ACp,2
for the

n = 2 case as follows:
20

1. When the two diagonals meet then P = {i p + i, i i + 2p − 2} with i = 1, ..., 3p − 4 and we
could map the vertices of the Stokes polytope which is a pentagon in case with the pentagon
corresponding to the accordiohedra once we notice that the all i = 1, ..., 8 which is part of
some diagonal ij do not appear in a vertex of the Stokes polytope. For example in the case of
P = {(1 4, 1 6} only i = 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 appear and similarly in the case of the accordiohedron
exactly 6 i = 1, p − 1, p, 2p − 3, 2p − 4, 3p − 4 out of a possible 3p − 4 appear thus we could
trivially define a map between the two as follows:
i → i + f (i)

1,
if i = 1



(p − 4), if i = 3, 4,
with f (i) =

2(p − 4), if i = 5, 6



3(p − 4), if i = 8
2. When the two diagonals do not meet then we notice that there are several possible choices of
the diagonals for p > 5, but we notice that the maximum number of i’s which can appear for
any choice of P is 8, since each diagonal appears twice thus there are only 4 possible ij’s. We
can thus identify these i’s with i = 1, ..., 8 and define a mapping.
For example we provide such a mapping between the Stokes polytope corresponding to Q =
{(14, 58)} and the accordiohedra corresponding to p = 5, 6 (see (2) )below:
p=5: With P = {(15, 610)}

1
f (i) = (p − 3), if i = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6


2(p − 3), if i = 7, 8
It is straightforward to find such a mapping for general p > 4 and a general choice of P .
10

10

It is a well known fact that there is a unique 2d convex polytope with a given number of vertices, so the above
mapping is not really needed here but in the case of 3 and higher dimensional polytopes ,there could be several
polytopes with same f -vector, thus we would need such a mapping to be sure that the polytopes are isomorphic.

primitives for n = 3 case

We would now try to find all primitive graphs for the n = 3 case. In this case there are 4 vertices
with 4p − 6 legs. As before we can try to recursively construct primitive graphs from n = 2 case.

There are two possible ways we add the 4th vertex which could be any of the k =

types in

the n = 2 case :
1. We can add another central vertex either above or below the central line to a n = 2 graph.
We call these graphs [i, i] and [i, j]. ( see figures (7), (9)).
2. We can add the vertex to any one of the external legs of the 3rd vertex. We denote these
graphs by (k1 , k2 , k3 ), where k1 + k2 + k3 = p − 3.
There are 3 primitives of the type [i, i] for each i = 1, · · · , k since the graphs where both vertices
are down are just cyclic permutations of the graph with both vertices up. In case where p is even
you also have a vertex with equal number of legs above and below the central line, thus there is only
one such primitive corresponding to this case. The graphs with one central vertex up and the other
22

down (the 2nd and 3rd graphs for each [i, i] ) have half periods i.e. under cyclic permutations they
go back to themselves after 2p − 3 operations. The same is also true for the symmetric vertex when
p is even. All other graphs have full period of 4p − 6.

[1,i]

[i,j]

Figure 8: The primitive graphs of the type [i, j].
There are 4 primitives for each [i, j] since now the graphs with both vertices down are inequivalent
to the ones with both vertices up under cyclic permutations. When p is even we have only 2 primitives
of the type [i, k] since [k] is symmetric. All these graphs all have a period of 4p − 6.

Since there are 3 diagonals now the relative configuration of diagonals can be of one of the

k1 , k3 6= 0.
3. All three diagonals meet at a vertex or form zig-zag configuration in this case the corresponding
accordiohedron is an associahedron. There are 3 graphs of this type namely [1, 1].
4. All three diagonals meet and form an inverted U configuration in this case the corresponding
accordiohedron is of the Lucas type. There is exactly one graph of this type which is (0, 0, p−3).

The accordiohedra for n = 3 we get continue to be one of the four kinds of Stokes polytopes. We
could define a function from vertices of the Stokes polytopes to that of the accordiohedra as we had
done in the n = 2 case to establish that this is indeed the case. We can thus continue to use the
same names Lucas, Mixed etc for the n = 3 Stokes polytopes for accordiohedra as well. We expect
that at sufficiently higher n, accordiohedra will be generated which do not correspond to any Stokes
polytope.

Determination of the weights

In this section we shall provide a simple method to determine the weights for the general case and
demonstrate the method in a few examples. We recall that we had the reduced amplitude M̃n which

26

is a weighted sum of canonical forms of all the primitive accordiohedra of a given dimension n. We
would like to determine the weights such that this gives the full amplitude i.e. M̃n = Mn .
The full amplitude Mn is given by :
n
X Y

Mn =

all ik jk k=1

1
Xik jk

where, the sum is over all (i1 j1 , ..., in jn ) that form a complete p-angulation.
Thus, to get the full amplitude from the partial amplitude we need to impose the constraint that
Q
each nk=1 Xi1 j appears exactly once.
k k

But as we had emphasised before the accordiohedron depends only on the relative configuration
of diagonals of the reference p-angulation which does not change under rotations and thus it is
sufficient to impose these constraints for the primitive p-angulations.
l
X

nip αpi = 1 for each primitive 1 ≤ i ≤ l

i=1

where, nip is number of times primitive i appears in the vertices of all accodiohedra, αpi are the
corresponding weights.
Since, we have managed to classify all the primitives unto n = 3 we should be able to implement
this straightforward procedure to get all the weights and we shall now discuss our results.
We shall first see what these conditions are for n = 2 in the p = 5, 6 cases.
p = 5 : In this case there are two primitives as we had explained in the section (4.3) and we get:

3α51 + α52 = 1
α51 + 4α52 = 1
which can be solved to give:
α51 =

3
,
11

α52 =

2
11

p = 6 : In this case there are 3 primitives and we get:
2α61 + α62 + 2α63 = 1
α61 + 4α62 = 1
α61 + 2α63 = 1
27

which can be solved to give:
α61 =

1
3

α62 =

, α63 =

We can similarly do this for any p with n = 2 and the results are the following :
For p = 2k
(

α(p−2−i,i) = 61
, i odd
3
and For p = 2k + 1
k+1+i
3p − 4

α(p−2−i,i) =
with i = 0, ..., k − 1.

The α’s for n = 3 case with p ≤ 12 are given below (for the sake of brevity we shall call α’s
corresponding to [i, j], (k1 , k2 , k3 ) as [i, j], (k1 , k2 , k3 )):
If p is even then :

Factorization

One of the remarkable consequences of relating tree level scattering amplitudes to positive geometries like associahedron, Stokes polytope is the fact that geometric factorization implied physical
factorization of scattering amplitude. This in turn implied that tree-level unitarity and locality are
emergent properties of the positive geometry [1, 2]. In this section we will try to argue that this
is indeed the case even for planar amplitudes in massless φp theory. We shall first argue that the
geometric factorisation of accordiohedron holds and then show how this leads to the factorisation of
the amplitude.
In [2] it was shown how the factorization of Stokes polytope leads to a recursions relation on
α’s. We shall see that even for more general Accordiohedra α’s are required to satisfy analogous
recursion relations.
Our first assertion is the following. Given any diagonal (ij), consider all P which contains ij
and the consider all the corresponding kinematic accordiohedron AC Pp,n . We contend that for each
accordiohedron, the corresponding facet Xij = 0 is a product of lower dimensional accordiohedra.
P2
P1
≡ AC p,m
× AC p,n+2−m

AC Pp,n

(9)

Xij = 0

where P1 and P2 are such that P1 ∪ P2 ∪ (ij) = P .
P1 is the p-angulation of the polygon {i, i + 1, . . . , j} and P2 is the p-angulation of {j, j +
1, . . . , n, . . . , i}. Now we know that, on AC Pp,n any planar scattering variable Xkl is a linear combination of Xij and remaining X’s which constitute P . Hence in order to prove this assertion we
need to show that any Xkl with i ≤ k < l ≤ j can be written as a linear combination of Xij and
elements of P1 and similarly any variable in the complimentary set can be written in terms of Xij
and elements of P2 .
However this is immediate since we know from the factorization property of associahedron proven
X
in [1] that any Xkl = Xij +
Xmn , some of these Xmn ∈ P1 and the others are constrained
i<m<n<j

via Xmn = dmn . This proves our assertion. Thus Xij = 0 facet factorizes into two lower dimensional
accordiohedra.
Our second assertion is that the geometric factorization implies amplitude factorization of φp
theory. This assertion is based on the following two facts (For details, we refer the reader to
appendix A of [1] and [4]).
(1) As the accordiohedra is a positive geometry, we know that it’s canonical form satisfies the
29

following properties satisfed by canonical form on any positive geometry A
ResH ωA = ωB

(10)

where we think of ωA as defined on the embedding space and H is any subspace in the embedding
space which contains the face B.
(2) It is also known that if B = B1 × B2 then
ω(B) = ω(B1 ) ∧ ω(B2 )

(11)

Thus we immediately see that
ResXij

= 0

P2
P1
ω(AC Pp,n ) = ωm
∧ ωn+2−m
∀ P.

(12)

where m = j − i + 1.
We thus see that residue over each accordiohedron which contains a boundary Xij → 0 factorizes
into residues over lower dimensional accordiohedra. This factorization property naturally implies
factorization of amplitudes as follows. Consider the n-gon with a diagonal (ij) (with i, j such that this
diagonal can be part of a p-angulation). This diagonal subdivides the n-gon into a two polygons with
vertices {i, . . . , j} and {j, . . . , n, 1, . . . i} respectively. By considering all the kinematic accordiohedra
f|j−i+1| , M
fn+2−(|j−i+1|) which correspond to left and
associated to these polygons, we can evaluate M
right sub-amplitudes respectively. This immediately implies that
fn |X
M
ij

= 0

fL 1 M
fR
= M
Xij

(13)

This proves physical factorization. We also note that, eqns. (9) and (13) imply following constraints on α’s.
X

αP =

X

αPL αPR

(14)

PL ,PR

P containing(ij)

The left hand side of the above equation involves sum over all accordiohedra AC Pp,n for which (ij) ∈ P
and the right hand side involves sum over PL and PR which range over all the p-angulations of the
two polygons to the left and right of the diagonal (ij) respectively.
It can be verified that in all the examples up to p = 12 and n = 3 the αP ’s do indeed satisfy
these constraints.
30

For n = 1 there is only one diagonal which we can to be (1, p). The accordiohedra is always a
line as we had emphasised in section (3.3) and (1, p) appears in the vertex of exactly two of these
lattices namely {1 p, p − 1 2p − 2} and {p + 1 2p + 1, 1 p}. There is only way to divide P into PL
and PR and both these are trivial have α = 1. Thus, the above equation (14) gives :

2αP = 1
1
αP =
for all P
2
We could expect that the set of equations (14) would help in determining all the weights [2].
But, as we shall now show this is not the case as (14) provides too few equations. In other words
the set of equations (14) provide a set of necessary but not sufficient conditions.
Let, us consider the case n = 2 for p = 5 and the diagonal (15), in this case the 11-gon gets
divided into a 5-gon and 8-gon and we have weights αPL = 12 and αPR = 1. There are exactly 4
squares and 5 pentagons which contain the diagonal (15) in their vertices. Thus, we have
4α51 + 5α52 = 2

(15)

We can check that for any other choice of diagonal (ij) we get the same equation. It is clear that this
is not sufficient to solve for α51 , α52 . The solution we had obtained using our prescription in section
3
2
(4.5) namely α51 = 11
, α52 = 11
does indeed satisfy (15).

Conclusions and Future work

Re-formulating scattering amplitudes as differential forms on positive geometries (succinctly called
the Amplituhedron program) has had profound impact on how we understand Quantum field theories
and how properties like unitarity and locality are a natural consequence of the positive geometries.
In theories like N = 4 Super Yang Mills theory, the Amplituhedron program offers conceptual as
well as striking technical advancements in the understanding of planar S-matrix. In the non supersymmetric world, these ideas were extended to bi-adjoint scalar theory in [1] where it was shown
that the corresponding amplituhedron is an associahedron in Kinematic space and the canonical
form on this associahedron was proportional to the scattering amplitude.
These ideas were extended from cubic to quartic interactions in [2] where the underlying positive geometry was Stokes polytope. However unlike Associahedron, which is unique (in a given
dimension), there are several Stokes polytopes in any given dimension and it was shown that one
31

had to sum over canonical forms of all such polytopes to obtain scattering amplitude of φ4 theory.
Not all Stokes polytopes contributed equally but one had to assign different weights to each Stokes
polytope. In [2] it was argued that these weights were not assigned to a given Stokes polytope but
to an equivalence class of such polytopes which were related to each other by cyclic permutations
and that in each such class, one could choose a representative that we called primitive. Whence
the computation of scattering amplitude reduced to the problem of finding all the primitives and
assigning weights to them.
In this paper, continuing along the lines of [1, 2] we extend the Amplituhedron program to (treelevel) planar amplitudes for massless scalar field theories with φp interactions. We have shown that
the positive geometry underlying scattering amplitudes in this theory is a class of polytopes called
accordiohedron. Accordiahedron is a family of polytopes whose members include associahedron and
Stokes Polytope.11
Just as in the case of quartic interactions there exists no single accordiohedron of a given dimension n and a weighted sum of canonical forms of all the accordiohedra of a given dimension n does
indeed produce the full planar amplitude. This re-affirms and generalises the result we had obtained
in in the case of quartic interactions.
In [2] the problem of counting all primitives (corresponding to Stokes polytopes) of a given
dimension had remained open. In this paper we fill this gap and in fact extend this notion to
primitive accordioheron. We give an enumeration of the number of primitives at arbitrary dimension
n and a complete classification of primitive diagrams for n ≤ 3.
We then gave a prescription to compute the weights and provided the results for the weights
obtained by using our prescription for all p > 4 in n = 1, 2 dimensions and p ≤ 12 for n = 3.
Accordioheron is a very general polytope and one may wonder if they can be used to extend the
Amplituhedron program to Scalar theories with mixed-vertices (e.g. theories with cubic as well as
quartic interactions). It turns out that this is indeed the case. [17]
There are several outstanding questions that arise out of our analysis. In [6] it was shown that
the 1-loop integrand of φ3 theory also corresponds to canonical form on a polytope which is well
known in mathematical literature called Halohedron. Whether this idea can be extended to 1-loop
integrand of φp theories remains to be seen.
One of the most striking results obtained in [1] was the derivation of CHY formula for biadjoint scalar φ3 interactions from the canonical form on kinematic space associahedron. More
11

Our work thus shows that the positive geometry underlying planar amplitudes in any scalar field theory is an
Accordioheron

32

in detail, it was shown that the (tree-level) moduli space of CHY scattering equations admits a
compactification which is nothing but an Associahedron (called worldsheet Associahedron) and the
Scattering equations can be understood as diffeomorphisms between the world-sheet Associahedron
and the Associahedron in Kinematic space. It was also shown that the canonical form on Kinematic
space Associahedron is nothing but a push-forward of the so-called Park Taylor form which is the
canonical form on world-sheet associahedron. Although CHY integrands exist for φp interactions
for p > 3 they do not admit any such geometric interactions. Our hope is that understanding of
kinematic space Accordiohedron is the first step in “geometrizing" the CHY formula for φp theories.

A

Counting planar diagrams

In this appendix we want to derive an explicit formula for the number an of planar tree level Feynman
diagrams with n vertices and arbitrary interactions. We begin by considering the “toy" equations of
motion which are equations of motion with a source where we set the d’Alembertian and couplings
to one [18]. In other words this is equivalent to setting all propagators and vertices to one. Since, the
perturbative solutions to equations of motion with a source are in 1-1 correspondence with connected
tree amplitudes, the solutions of these equations gives us the generating functional for the number
of Feynman diagrams.
Planar diagrams in φp theory: The toy equations for this case are
φ = J + φp−1

(16)

We want to φ(J) from above which would be the generating function of Planar diagrams. Note that
we have φp−1 instead of

φp−1
(p−1)!

since we only want to count planar diagrams which correspond to

33

diagrams that have a fixed ordering. We can invert (16) by treating it as a formal power series and
using the Lagrange series inversion formula.
If z = f (w) which is analytic about w = 0 and f 0 (0) 6= 0 then w = g(z) in the neighbourhood of
z = 0 with g(z) given by the power series:
g(z) =
