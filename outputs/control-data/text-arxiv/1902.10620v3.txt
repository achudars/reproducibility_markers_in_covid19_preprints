Abstract. In this paper we introduce Calderón–Zygmund theory for
singular stochastic integrals with operator-valued kernel. In particular,
we prove Lp -extrapolation results under a Hörmander condition on the
kernel. Sparse domination and sharp weighted bounds are obtained
under a Dini condition on the kernel, leading to a stochastic version of
the solution to the A2 -conjecture. The results are applied to obtain pindependence and weighted bounds for stochastic maximal Lp -regularity
both in the complex and real interpolation scale. As a consequence we
obtain several new regularity results for the stochastic heat equation on
Rd and smooth and angular domains.

1. Introduction
In the study of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), one often needs sharp regularity results for the linear equations. This together
with fixed point arguments can be used to obtain existence, uniqueness and
regularity for the solution to nonlinear SPDEs. During the last decades
so-called maximal regularity results for SPDEs have been obtained in many
papers. We refer to [DZ14, Section 6.3] for an overview on the subject in the
Hilbert space setting. In the Lq -setting sharp regularity results have been

obtained in [Kry99] by real analysis and PDE methods, and in [NVW12b]
by functional calculus techniques.
In the above approaches one needs to prove sharp regularity estimates for
singular stochastic integral operator of the form
Z ∞
(1.1)
SK G(s) :=
K(s, t)G(t) dWH (t),
s ∈ R+ ,
0

where G is an adapted process and WH is a cylindrical Brownian motion (see
Section 3) and K is a given operator-valued kernel K : R+ × R+ → L(X, Y ).
An important example of a kernel K is
(1.2)

K(s, t) = e−(s−t)A 1t<s

where −A is the generator of an analytic semigroup and and Y is either
the real interpolation space (X, D(A))1/2,2 , the complex interpolation space
[X, D(A)]1/2 or the fractional domain space D((λ+A1/2 )), where λ ∈ ρ(−A).
This kernel has a singularity of the form kK(s, t)k ≤ C(s−t)−1/2 for |s−t| <
1. The Lp -boundedness of singular stochastic integrals with this kernel leads
to stochastic maximal Lp -regularity.
Unlike in the deterministic setting, there is no general theory for the Lp boundedness of singular stochastic integral operators. The aim of this paper
is to provide a version of this theory and to use it to obtain new regularity
results for abstract classes of SPDEs and more concrete examples such as
the heat equation.
1.1. Deterministic singular integrals. Before Calderón-Zygmund theory [CZ52] was developed, the Lp -boundedness of singular integral operators
Z
K(s, t)f (t) dt
T f :=
Rd

was considered on a case by case basis. Typically the singularity of the
kernel K is of the form |K(s, t)| ≤ C(s − t)−1 . Important examples are the
Hilbert transform (for d = 1), and the Riesz transforms (for d ≥ 2) in which
case the integral has to be interpreted as a principal value. Positive kernels
are usually easier to deal with as in this case there is absolute convergence
and one can apply Schur’s lemma (see [Gra14b, Appendix A]).
In the convolution setting, i.e. K(s, t) = k(s − t), the Marcinkiewicz–
Mihlin multiplier theorem gives simple sufficient conditions on b
k (the Fourier
transform of k) under which TK is a bounded operator on Lp (Rd ) for all
p ∈ (1, ∞). For detailed expositions on Calderón–Zygmund operators and
beyond, we refer to [Gra14a, Gra14b, Ste93] and references therein.
The above results have been partially extended to the case were K is
scalar valued and f takes values in a Banach space (see the monograph
[GR85]). A breakthrough result by [Bur83] and [Bou83] was that the Hilbert
transform is bounded on Lp (R; X) with p ∈ (1, ∞) if and only if X is a socalled UMD space (see [HNVW16, Chapter 4 and 5] for details). Another
major breakthrough was given in [McC84], [Bou86] and [Zim89] where the
Marcinkiewicz–Mihlin multiplier theorem and Littlewood–Paley decomposition were obtained for the class of UMD spaces.

For a long time the operator-valued extension of the latter results were unavailable outside Hilbert spaces. In [Wei01] the notion of R-boundedness was
used to obtain an Marcinkiewicz–Mihlin multiplier theorem in the operatorvalued setting for d = 1. This result was motivated by its applications
to maximal Lp -regularity for parabolic PDEs, which were also discussed in
[Wei01]. In this context the kernel K : R2+ → L(X, D(A)) is given by
K(s, t) = e−(s−t)A 1t<s ,
where −A is the generator of an analytic semigroup. This kernel satisfies
kK(s, t)k ≤ C(s − t)−1 for |t − s| < 1. Using Calderón–Zygmund theory
one can therefore easily deduce that the Lp -boundedness of the associated
singular integral operator for some p0 ∈ [1, ∞] implies Lp -boundedness for all
p ∈ (1, ∞) (see [Dor00, Theorem 7.1]). We refer to [DHP03, KW04, PS16]
for a detailed discussion on the history of maximal Lp -regularity and to
[KPW10, PSW18, PW17] for applications to nonlinear PDEs.
1.2. Singular stochastic integrals. A Calderón–Zygmund theory for stochastic integral operators as in (1.1) is not available. The behavior of stochastic singular integral operators (1.1) differs a lot from the deterministic
setting. Due to the Itô L2 -isometry the integrals convergence absolutely and
thus no principal values are needed. As a consequence, in contrast with the
deterministic setting, the scalar-valued setting can easily be characterized,
see Section 3.4. In the operator-valued setting cancellation can for example
occur in the following form:
Z
1/2
kK(s, t)xk2Y dt
(1.3)
≤ CkxkX ,
s ∈ R+ , x ∈ X,
R+

where X and Y are a Banach spaces. If the kernel is of this form, then using
a simple Fubini argument one can check that SK is L2 -bounded (see Propositions 3.4 and 3.10(i)). In particular, this method was used for the kernel
in (1.2) in the classical monograph [DZ14, Section 6.3]. A sophisticated extension of this type of argument was used in [Brz95], [BH09] and [DL98] to
cover Lp -boundedness in the scale of real interpolation spaces (X, D(A))θ,p .
The complex interpolation scale is more complicated. In particular, for
X = Lp (Rd ) (1.3) is often not true. For example it fails for A = −∆. To
obtain Lp -estimates in this case, [Kry94, Kry99, Kry08] use sharp estimates
for stochastic integrals and sophisticated real analysis arguments. Moreover,
by using PDE arguments the operator A can be replaced by a second order
elliptic operator with coefficients depending on (t, ω, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × Ω × Rd ,
where some regularity in x is assumed, but only progressive measurability
is assumed in (t, ω). By an elaborate trick in [Kry00] the estimates were
extended to an Lp (Lq )-setting with p ≥ q ≥ 2. There are many sophisticated
variations of the above methods in the literature in which different operators
than ∆ are considered and equations on different domains D ⊆ Rd are
treated (see e.g. [CKLL18, CKL19, Du20, Kim05, KK18, Kry09, Lin14] and
references therein).
On the scale of tent spaces stochastic maximal regularity for elliptic operators in divergence form is shown in [ANP14]. This is done through extrapolation using off-diagonal estimates, which are substitutes for the classical

pointwise kernel estimates of Calderón-Zygmund theory. See also [AKMP12]
for the more general harmonic analysis framework developed to analyse this
scale.
In [NVW12b, NVW15b] the Lp -boundedness of stochastic singular integrals with kernel (1.2) was obtained using the boundedness of the H ∞ functional calculus together with the sharp two-sided estimates for stochastic
integrals in UMD spaces developed in [NVW07]. One of the advantages of
this approach is that it can be used for an abstract operator A as long as
it has an H ∞ -calculus. Secondly, the stochastic integral operator is automatically Lp -bounded for any p ∈ (2, ∞). Some geometric restrictions on X
are required, but these are fulfilled for Lq , W s,q , etc. as long as q ∈ [2, ∞)
(see Section 9). In particular, mixed Lp (Lq )-regularity can be obtained for
all q ∈ [2, ∞) and p ∈ (2, ∞), where p = q = 2 is allowed as well. The
results of [NVW12b, NVW15b] have been applied to semilinear equations
in [NVW12a], to quasilinear equations in [Hor19] and to fully nonlinear
equations in [Agr18].
Recently, in [PV19] the framework of [NVW12b, NVW15b] has been
extended to cover the case where A depends on time and Ω, as long as
D(A(t, ω)) is constant. The method is based on a reduction to the time and
Ω-independent setting and gives a new approach to [Kry99], which additionally includes new optimal space-time regularity estimates and is applicable
to a large class of SPDEs.
A large part of the theory of maximal Lp -regularity for deterministic PDEs
was developed after the Calderón-Zygmund theory for operator-valued kernels was founded. In the stochastic case such a Calderón–Zygmund theory
is not available yet, and our main motivation is to build such a theory and
discover its potential for stochastic maximal Lp -regularity (see Subsection
1.4). Our first main theorem in this direction is as follows:
Theorem 1.1 (Lp -boundedness of stochastic Calderón-Zygmund operators). Let X and Y be Banach spaces with type 2 and assume Y is a UMD
space. Let K : R+ × R+ → L(X, Y ) be strongly measurable and assume that
for every ball B ⊂ R+ we have the following Hörmander condition

for some constant C > 0 independent of B. Fix p ∈ [2, ∞) and suppose that
the mapping SK as defined in (1.1) is bounded from LpF (Ω × R+ ; γ(H, Y ))
into Lp (Ω × R+ ; Y ). Then for all q ∈ (2, ∞) the mapping SK is bounded
from LqF (Ω × R+ ; γ(H, Y )) into Lq (Ω × R+ ; Y ).

The above theorem follows from Proposition 3.4, Theorem 5.2 and Theorem 5.4 in the homogenous setting (see Section 7). In Theorems 5.2 and
5.4 we prove a general extrapolation result for singular γ-kernels. In this
setting we also obtain the end point estimates L2 → L2,∞ and L∞ →
BMO. The results are a stochastic version of the classical extrapolation
results for Calderón–Zygmund operators (see [Hör60] for the scalar case and
[BCP62, GR85] for the vector-valued case).

The conditions (1.4) and (1.5) are L2 -variants of what is usually called the
Hörmander condition. The Lr -variant for r ∈ [1, ∞] also appears in [Hör60,
Definition 2.1] in the scalar case and in [RV17, Section 5.1] in the vectorvalued case, where it was used to extrapolate (deterministic) boundedness
of operators from Lp into Lq with p1 − 1q = 1r to other pairs (u, v) satisfying
1 < u ≤ v < ∞ and u1 − v1 = 1r .
1.3. Weighted boundedness. Next we will state a result on weighted
boundedness of stochastic singular integral operators. For deterministic
Calderón-Zygmund operators satisfying the standard conditions, this result
was obtained in [Hyt12]. It settles the so-called A2 -conjecture for standard
Calderón-Zygmund operators and states that under standard assumptions
on the kernel K one has for all p ∈ (1, ∞) that

The bound (1.6) with a non-optimal dependence on the weight characteristic
is known for a much longer time (see [GR85] and references therein). Originally the A2 -conjecture was formulated for the Beurling–Ahlfords transform
in [AIS01] where it is shown to imply quasiregularity of certain complex
functions. Shortly afterwards it was settled for this operator in [PV02] and
subsequently many other operators were treated, which eventually led to
[Hyt12].
A new proof was obtained in [Ler13] where it was shown that any standard Calderon-Zygmund operator can be pointwise dominated by a positive sparse operator. A further extension to Calderón-Zygmund operators
satisfying a weaker regularity condition (the so-called Dini condition) was
obtained in [Lac17]. During the last few years simplified proofs have been
obtained by several authors. For our purposes the method in [LO19], generalized to our setting in [Lor19], is the most suitable and it can be used to
obtain the following stochastic version of the A2 -theorem:

Theorem 1.2 (Sharp weighted bounds). Let X and Y be Banach spaces
with type 2 and assume Y is a UMD space. Let K : R+ × R+ → L(X, Y ) be
strongly measurable and assume that

Suppose SK as defined in (1.1) is bounded from LpF (Ω × R+ ; γ(H, Y )) into

R+ , w; γ(H, Y )) into Lq (Ω × R+ , w; Y ) for all q ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ Aq/2 (R+ ),
and the following weighted bound on the operator norm holds

The above result follows from Theorem 6.3 in the homogenous setting (see
Section 7), which is deduced from a sparse domination result. Furthermore
we prove that the above estimate is sharp in terms of the dependence on the
weight characteristic. Note that the difference with (1.6) occurs because the
Lp -norm of (1.1) is equivalent to a certain generalized square function. The
conditions (4.3) and (4.4) together with the integrability condition on ω are
L2 -versions of the so-called Dini condition. The integrability condition on
ω holds in particular if ω(t) = Ctǫ for some C > 0 and ǫ ∈ (0, 1/2].
1.4. Consequences for stochastic maximal Lp -regularity. From Theorem 1.1 we find that in many instances stochastic maximal Lp -regularity for
some p ∈ [2, ∞) implies stochastic maximal Lq -regularity for all q ∈ (2, ∞)
(see Section 8). In order to state a particular result here consider the following stochastic evolution equation on a Banach space X:
(1.7)

du(t) + Au(t) dt = G(t)dWH (t),

u(0) = 0.

If −A generates a C0 -semigroup (e−tA )t≥0 on X, then the solution u is given
by
Z t
e−(t−s)A G(s) dWH (s).
u(t) =
0

Theorem 1.3. Assume −A is the generator of a bounded C0 -semigroup on
a UMD Banach space X with type 2. Let p ∈ [2, ∞) and I = (0, T ) with
T ∈ (0, ∞]. Suppose that for all G ∈ LpF (Ω × (0, T ); γ(H, X)) the solution
u to (1.7) satisfies
1

kA 2 ukLp (Ω×I;X) . kGkLp

F (Ω×I;γ(H,X))

.

Then for all q ∈ (2, ∞), w ∈ Aq/2 (I) and G ∈ LqF (Ω × (0, T ), w; γ(H, X))
the solution to (1.7) satisfies
1

kA 2 ukLq (Ω×I,w;X) . kGkLq

F (Ω×I,w;γ(H,X))

.

The boundedness of the semigroup is only needed if T = ∞. A more general result is contained in Theorem 8.2 below. For this we should note that
the above Lp -estimate implies sectoriality of angle < π/2 (see [AV20, Theorem 4.1]). Theorem 1.3 can be seen as the stochastic analogue of [Dor00,
Theorem 7.1]. Moreover, the weighted estimates are a stochastic version of
[CF14, Corollary 4] and [CK18, Theorem 5.1].
For many differential operators A one can directly apply the results in
[NVW12b, NVW15b] to obtain stochastic maximal Lp -regularity. However,
there are numerous situations where this is not the case, for example if:
(i) A does not have a bounded H ∞ -calculus;
(ii) There is no explicit characterization of D(A1/2 ) known;
(iii) A(t) and its domain D(A(t)) are time-dependent;
(iv) X does not satisfy the R-boundedness condition of [NVW12b, NVW15b].
In Corollary 8.4 and Remark 8.5 we give a situation where (i) occurs, i.e.
we give an example of an operator A without a bounded H ∞ -calculus which
has stochastic maximal Lp -regularity. In Example 8.12 it seems unknown
if (i) holds and (ii) seems unavailable as well. In Subsection 8.6 we present

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

7

applications to certain non-autonomous problems where (iii) occurs and in
Theorem 8.6 we have avoided the geometric restriction mentioned in (iv).
Another, important novelty is that it is possible to deduce mixed Lp (Lq )bounded from L2 (L2 )-boundedness by combining our extrapolation result
with the stochastic-deterministic extrapolation result of [KK16]. This reduces the study of stochastic maximal Lp -regularity problem on Lq to the
study of maximal L2 -regularity problem on L2 and Green’s function estimates (see Remark 5.9 and Examples 8.9 and 8.17).
The use of temporal Ap/2 (R+ )-weights in stochastic maximal Lp -regularity
is new. In most of the results in [NVW12b, NVW15b] such weights can
also be added without causing major difficulties, but it is very natural
to deduce this from extrapolation theory. Moreover with our method we
actually obtain a sharp dependence on the Ap/2 -characteristic. Weights
of the form tα have already been considered before in [AV20, PV19] and
can be used to allow rough initial data in stochastic evolution equations.
This has become a central tool in deterministic evolution equations (see e.g.
[KPW10, MS12, PS04] and references therein). General Ap -weights in parabolic PDEs have used in [DK18, DK19, GLV16, GV17b, GV17a] to derive
mixed Lp (Lq )-regularity estimates by Rubio de Francia’s weighted extrapolation theorem [GR85, CMP11].
In Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 one always starts from an Lp -bounded
stochastic integral operator. It would be interesting to find general sufficient
conditions from which boundedness can be derived. In the deterministic
case this can be done using T (1) and T (b)-theorems (see e.g. [HW06, Hyt06,
HH16] for the vector-valued case). At least in the Hilbert space setting
in the convolution case we obtain a full characterization in Corollary 5.10
and Corollary 6.5 assuming a Hörmander and Dini condition, respectively.
Finally we mention that it would be interesting to develop a stochastic
Calderón–Zygmund theory for other noises than cylindrical Brownian motion.
This paper is organized as follows:
• In Section 2 give some preliminaries on Banach space geometry, γradonifying operators, Lorentz spaces, maximal operators and Muckenhoupt weights.
• In Section 3 we introduce the stochastic integral operators and establish
a connection with γ-integral operators.
• In Section 4 we give the definitions of 2-Hörmander kernels and (ω, 2)Dini kernels and provide some classes of examples.
• In Section 5 we prove the extrapolation results for γ-integral operators
under a Hörmander condition.
• In Section 6 we obtain sparse domination under a Dini condition and
use this to prove sharp weighted bounds.
• In Section 7 we explain how the results of Sections 5 and 6 can be
extended to spaces of homogeneous type. Motivated by the application
to stochastic integral operators our main example here is the time
interval (0, T ) with T ∈ (0, ∞].
• In Section 8 we will apply the results of the previous sections to study
the p-independence of stochastic maximal Lp -regularity. Here we cover

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

8

both the time-independent setting and the time-dependent setting using the conditions of Acquistapace and Terreni. Moreover, applications
to the (time-dependent) heat equation are given, leading to regularity
results in both the complex and real interpolation scale.
• In Section 9 we prove a p-independence result on the R-boundedness
of stochastic convolutions.
• Finally in Appendix A we prove some technical kernel estimates.

a sequence of independent Rademacher variables, i.e. uniformly distributed
random variables taking values in {z ∈ K : |z| ≤ 1}. We say that X has
type p ∈ [1, 2] is there exists a constant C ≥ 0 such that for all n ∈ N and

with the usual modification if q = ∞. The least admissible constants C
will be denoted by τp,X and cq,X respectively. Note that by randomization
equations (2.1) and (2.2) imply the same estimates with the Rademacher
sequence replaced by a Gaussian sequence, i.e. a sequence of independent
standard Gaussian random variables.
All Banach spaces have type 1 and cotype ∞. We say that X has nontrivial type if X has type p ∈ (1, 2] and finite cotype if X has cotype q ∈ [2, ∞).
As example we note that the Lebesgue spaces Lp (Rd ) and Sobolev spaces

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

W k,p(Rd ) have type p ∧ 2 and cotype p ∨ 2. For more details and examples
we refer to [HNVW17, Chapter 7].
We say that a Banach space X has the UMD property if the martingale
difference sequence of any finite martingale in Lp (Ω; X) is unconditional for
some (equivalently all) p ∈ (1, ∞). That is, if there exists a constant C > 0
such that for all finite martingales (fk )nk=1 in Lp (Ω; X) and scalars |ǫk | = 1,

The least admissible constant C in (2.3) will be denoted by βp,X . Standard
examples of Banach spaces with the UMD property include reflexive Lp spaces, Lorentz spaces, Sobolev spaces and Besov spaces. For a thorough
introduction to the theory of UMD spaces we refer the reader to [Pis16] and
[HNVW16, Chapter 4].
2.2. γ-radonifying operators. We recall the definition and some basic
properties of γ-radonifying operators, for details we refer to [HNVW17,
Chapter 9].
Let X be a Banach space and H be a Hilbert space. For x ∈ X and e ∈ H
we let e⊗x be the rank-one operator from H to X given by h 7→
Phh, eix. The
γ-radonifying norm of a finite-rank operator of the form T = nk=1 ek ⊗ xk ,
with e1 , · · · , en ∈ H orthonormal and x1 , · · · , xn ∈ X, is defined by
n
X
,
kT kγ(H;X) :=
γk xk 2
k=1

L (Ω;X)

where (γk )nk=1 is a Gaussian sequence on a probability space (Ω, P). By
the invariance of Gaussians in Rd under orthogonal transformations (see
[HNVW16, Proposition 6.1.23]), this norm is well-defined. The completion
of all finite rank operators from H into X with respect to k·kγ(H;X) is denoted
by γ(H, X). Note that in particular γ(H, X) ֒→ L(H, X).
For a measure space (S, µ), we write γ(S; H, X) := γ(L2 (S; H), X) and
in particular γ(S; X) := γ(L2 (S), X). Any strongly measurable f : S → X,
for which hf, x∗ i ∈ L2 (S) for all x∗ ∈ X ∗ , defines a bounded linear operator
Tf : L2 (S) → X by
Z
f ϕ dµ,
ϕ ∈ L2 (S),
Tf ϕ :=
S

where the integral is well-defined in the Pettis sense (see [HNVW16, Theorem 1.2.37]). If Tf ∈ γ(S; X) we say that f represents Tf and write
f ∈ γ(S; X).
If the Banach space X has type 2 we have the following embedding properties for the γ-spaces, which follow directly from [HNVW17, Theorem 9.2.10
and Proposition 7.1.20]. See [AV20, Proposition 2.5] for the details.
Lemma 2.1. Let X be a Banach space with type 2, H a Hilbert space and
(S, µ) a σ-finite measure space. Then we have the following embeddings

Finally, for our γ-version of the A2 -theorem in Section 6 we will need the
following lemma, which follows directly from [HNVW17, Proposition 9.4.13].
Lemma 2.2. Let X be a Banach space with type 2 and let f1 , · · · , fn ∈
γ(S; X) be disjointly supported. Then we have

2.3. Lorentz spaces. We recall the definition and some elementary properties of Lorentz spaces, for details we refer to [Gra14a, Tri78]. For a Banach
space X a σ-finite measure space (S, µ), p ∈ (1, ∞) and q ∈ [1, ∞] let
Lp,q (S; X) = (L1 (S; X), L∞ (S; X))θ,q ,

θ=

1
p′ .

The space Lp,q (S; X) is called the X-valued Lorentz space. An equivalent
quasi-norm is given by (see [Gra14a, Proposition 1.4.9] and [Tri78, Theorem
1.18.6]):
|||f |||Lp,q (S;X) := kt 7→ t1/p f ∗ (t)kLq (R+ , dt )

1/p

Lq (R+ , dt

,

where f ∗ denotes the decreasing rearrangement of kf kX (see [Gra14a, Section 1.4]). An equivalent norm can be extracted from [Gra14a, Exercise
1.4.3]. For p ∈ (1, ∞) one has Lp,p(S; X) = Lp (S; X). In the scalar case
Lp,q (S) is a Banach function space.
If p ∈ (1, ∞) and q ∈ [1, ∞), then the simple functions are dense in
Lp,q (S; X). Indeed, this follows from [Tri78, Theorems 1.6.2 and 1.18.6.2])
and the density of the simple functions in Lr (S; X) for r ∈ [1, ∞).
If p ∈ (1, ∞) and q ∈ [1, ∞] and µ(S) < ∞ we have Lp,∞ (S) ֒→ L1 (S)
with
(2.4)

′

kf kL1 (S) ≤ µ(S)1/p kf kLp,∞ (S) ,

f ∈ Lp,∞ (S),

which follows directly from the definition and the embedding L∞ (S) ֒→
L1 (S) with constant µ(S).
In the next result we extend the γ-Fubini theorem of [HNVW17, Theorem
9.4.8] to Lorentz spaces.
Proposition 2.3 (γ-Fubini). Let X be a Banach space and let (S, µ) be a
measure space. Then the following assertions hold:
(i) For all p ∈ (1, ∞],
γ(H, Lp,∞ (S; X)) ֒→ Lp,∞ (S; γ(H, X))

(ii) For all p ∈ (1, ∞) and q ∈ [1, ∞),

γ(H, Lp,q (S; X)) = Lp,q (S; γ(H, X))

isomorphically.
Proof. Let E = Lp,q (S) and for a Banach space Y we write E(Y ) for the
space of strongly measurable functions f : S → Y such that kf kE(Y ) :=
kf kY E < ∞.

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

We make two preliminary observations. Since E is a Banach space the
triangle inequality in E implies that for all simple functions ξ : Ω → E,
(2.5)

kξkE(L1 (Ω)) ≤ kξkL1 (Ω;E) .

By density this extends to a contractive embedding L1 (Ω; E) ֒→ E(L1 (Ω)).
The second observation is a certain converse estimate to the above. If
p ≤ q < ∞, we set r = q and if q ≤ p < ∞ we set r = p + 1. Then E
is r-concave (see [Mal04, Theorems 4.6 and 5.1]). This implies that for all
simple functions ξ : S → Lr (Ω),
(2.6)

kξkLr (Ω;E) ≤ Cp,q kξkE(Lr (Ω)) .

By density this can be extended to a contractive embedding E(Lr (Ω)) ֒→
Lr (Ω; E).
P
Let (hj )nj=1 be an orthonormal system in H and let f = nj=1 hj ⊗ ξj with
Pn
n
ξj ∈ E(X). Now setting ξ =
j=1 γj ξj X , where (γj )j=1 is a Gaussian
sequence, we can write
kf kγ(H,E(X)) =
kf kE(γ(H,X)) =

n

n
X

γj ξj

j=1

L2 (Ω;E(Y ))

= kξkL2 (Ω;E) ,

E(L2 (Ω;X))

= kξkE(L2 (Ω))

By the Kahane–Khintchine inequalities replacing the L2 (Ω)-norm on the
right-hand sides of the above identities with Lr (Ω) with r ∈ [1, ∞) leads to
an equivalent norm. Taking r = 1 we have by (2.5) that
kf kE(γ(H,X)) ≤ C kf kγ(H,E(X)) ,
which by density proves γ(H, E(X)) ֒→ E(γ(H, X)) and this proves (i) and
one of the embeddings in (ii).
To prove (ii) note that by the above with r = p + 1 we find by (2.6) that
kf kγ(H,E(X)) ≤ Cp,q kf kE(γ(H,X)) .
Again by density this gives E(γ(H, X)) ֒→ γ(H, E(X)).



Remark 2.4. Actually in Proposition 2.3(i) the Lorentz space can be replaced
by any Banach function space E. Moreover, the extension of (ii) to this
setting holds if E is r-concave for some r < ∞.
The result of Proposition 2.3 can also be extended to quasi-Banach function spaces which are p-convex and q-concave. For the definition of γ(H, Y )
for quasi-Banach spaces we refer to [CCV18]. In particular, by [Mal04, Theorems 4.6 and 5.1] and [Kal80, Section 6] it follows that Proposition 2.3(ii)
holds for Lp,q (S; X) for all p, q ∈ (0, ∞).
2.4. Maximal operators. We define the Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator M for an f ∈ L1loc (Rd ) by
Z
s ∈ Rd ,
M f (s) := sup |f |,
Q∋s

Q

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

12

where the supremum is taken over all cubes Q ⊆ Rd containing s. For
r ∈ (0, ∞) and f ∈ Lrloc (Rd ) we define Mr f = M (|f |r )1/r . These operators
satisfy the following bounds:
Lemma 2.5. Let 0 < r < p < ∞, then

f ∈ Lp (Rd ),

kMr f kLp (Rd ) ≤ Cp,r,d kf kLp (Rd ) ,

f ∈ Lp,∞ (Rd ),

kMr f kLp,∞ (Rd ) ≤ Cp,r,d kf kLp,∞ (Rd ) ,

f ∈ Lp (Rd ).

kMp f kLp,∞ (Rd ) ≤ Cd kf kLp (Rd ) ,

The case r = 1 in the first two inequalities and the case p = 1 in the
third inequality follow for example from Doob’s maximal inequalities and a
covering argument (see [HNVW16, Theorem 3.2.3 and Lemma 3.2.26]). The
general cases follow from a simple rescaling argument.
Let X be a Banach space. We define the sharp maximal operator for an
f ∈ L1loc (Rd ; X) by
Z
Z
#
f (t′ ) dt′
dt,
s ∈ Rd ,
f (t) −
M f (s) := sup
Q∋s

Q

X

Q

where the supremum is again taken over all cubes Q ⊆ Rd containing s.
Note that it is immediate from this definition that M # f ≤ 2M (kf kX ), so
by Lemma 2.5 we have in particular that M # f ∈ Lp (Rd ) if f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X).
The converse is also true, which is the content of the next lemma. The proof
for the case X = C can be found in [Gra14b, Corollary 3.4.6], the general
case follows analogously replacing absolute values by norms.
Lemma 2.6 (Fefferman-Stein). Let X be a Banach space, 1 < r ≤ p < ∞
and f ∈ Lr (Rd ; X). Then f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) if and only if M # f ∈ Lp (Rd ) and
−1
Cp,d
M #f

.

Lemma 2.6 is not valid for p = ∞. In this case the space of all f ∈
L1loc (Rd ; X) such that M # f ∈ L∞ (Rd ; X) is strictly larger than L∞ (Rd ; X).
We let BMO(Rd ; X) be the space of all f ∈ L1loc (Rd ; X) such that
Z
kf (s) − ckX ds < ∞
kf kBMO(Rd ;X) := sup inf
Q c∈X

Q

where the supremum is taken over all cubes Q ⊆ Rd . In analogy with Lemma
2.6 we have
1
kM # f kL∞ (Rd ) ≤ kf kBMO(Rd ;X) ≤ kM # f kL∞ (Rd ) .
2
Note that k·kBMO(Rd ;X) is not a norm, since kc 1Rd kBMO(Rd ;X) = 0 for any
c ∈ X.
2.5. Muckenhoupt weights. We recall the basic properties of Muckenhoupt weights on Rd , for a general overview see [Gra14a, Chapter 7]. Analogous definitions can be given for weights on (0, T ) for T ∈ (0, ∞].
A weight is a locally integrable function w : Rd → (0, ∞). For p ∈ [1, ∞)
and a weight w and a Banach space X we let Lp (Rd , w; X) be the subspace

and let Lp,∞(Rd , w; X) be defined as in Section 2.3. We will say that a

3. Stochastic integral operators
For details of the introduced notions in this section we refer to [NVW07,
NVW15b]. Let X be a Banach space and H be a Hilbert space. Let (Ω, A, P)
be a probability space with filtration (Ft )t≥0 .
Let W ∈ L(L2 (R+ ; H), L2 (Ω)) denote an isonormal mapping (see [Kal02])
such that Wf is Ft -measurable if f = 0 on [t, ∞). Define a cylindrical
Brownian motion (WH (t))t≥0 by WH (t)h := W(1[0,t] h).
For f = 1(a,b] ⊗h ⊗ ξ, where 0 ≤ a < b < ∞ and ξ ∈ L∞ (Ω; X) is strongly
Fa -measurable, define
Z s
f (t) dWH (t) := (WH (b ∧ s) − WH (a ∧ s))h ⊗ ξ ∈ Lp (Ω; X).
0

for each s ≥ 0. The functions in the linear span of such f are called the
finite rank adapted step processes. We extend the definition of the stochastic
integral by linearity.
For T ∈ (0, ∞] and p ∈ [1, ∞), we let LpF (Ω; γ(0, T ; H, X)) denote the
closure of all finite rank adapted step functions in Lp (Ω; γ(0, T ; H, X)). One
RT
has that f ∈ LpF (Ω; γ(0, T ; H, X)) if and only if 0 f 1[0,s] ⊗h dt is strongly
Fs -measurable and f ∈ Lp (Ω; γ(0, T ; H, X)) for all s ∈ (0, T ) and h ∈ H.
The following result provides two-sided estimates for the stochastic integral
with respect to a H-cylindrical Brownian motion (WH (t))t≥0 .

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

Theorem 3.1 (Itô isomorphism). Let X be a UMD Banach space, let p ∈
(1, ∞) and T ∈ (0, ∞]. For every adapted finite rank step process f : (0, T )×
Ω → L(H, X), one has
Z T
hp,X kf kLp (Ω;γ(0,T ;H,X)) .
f (t) dWH (t) p

RT
In particular, the mapping f 7→ 0 f (t) dW (t) extends to an isomorphism
from LpF (Ω; γ(0, T ; H, X)) to Lp (Ω; X).

3.1. Stochastic integral operators. For p ∈ [2, ∞), T ∈ (0, ∞] and a
weight w on (0, T ), let LpF (Ω × (0, T ), w; γ(H, X)) denote the closure of all
adapted step functions in Lp (Ω × (0, T ), w; γ(H, X)), where we omit the
weight if w ≡ 1. The reason we consider p ∈ [2, ∞) will become clear in
Subsection 3.4. Although we will not assume type 2 for the moment, it
follows from [NVW15a, Proposition 6.2] that already for very easy kernels
K in order to have boundedness of SK a type 2 condition on Y is necessary.
Definition 3.2 (Stochastic integral operator). Let X be a Banach space
and Y a UMD Banach space. Let p ∈ [2, ∞), T ∈ (0, ∞], w be a weight on
(0, T ) and let
K : (0, T ) × (0, T ) → L(X, Y )
H (Lp ((0, T ), w)) if for f ∈
be strongly measurable. We say that K ∈ KW
p
LF (Ω × (0, T ), w; γ(H, X)) and a.e. s ∈ (0, T ) the mapping t 7→ K(s, t)f (t)
is in LpF (Ω; γ(0, T ; H, Y )) and the operator SK given by
Z T
K(s, t)f (t) dWH (t),
s ∈ (0, T )
SK f (s) :=
0

is bounded from LpF (Ω × (0, T ), w; γ(H, X)) into Lp (Ω × (0, T ), w; Y ). We

norm KW
kKkKH (Lp ((0,T ),w)) := kSK kLp

F (Ω×(0,T ),w;γ(H,X))→L

We omit the weight if w ≡ 1 and we omit the Hilbert space if H = R.
We want to study the boundedness properties of SK . In the next results
we will reformulate this problem by reducing to the deterministic setting
using square functions (γ-norms in time) and reduce considerations to the
case H = R.
Definition 3.3 (γ-integral operator). Let X and Y be a Banach spaces.
Let p ∈ [2, ∞), w be a weight on Rd and let
K : Rd × Rd → L(X, Y )

be strongly measurable. We say that K ∈ KγH (Lp (Rd , w)) (resp. K ∈
KγH (Lp,∞ (Rd , w))) if for f ∈ Lp (Rd , w; γ(H, X)) and a.e s ∈ Rd the mapping
t 7→ K(s, t)f (t) is in γ(Rd ; H, Y ) and the operator TK given by
TK f (s) := K(s, ·)f (·),

s ∈ Rd

is bounded from Lp (Rd , w; γ(H, X)) into Lp (Rd , w; γ(Rd ; H, Y )) (resp. from
Lp into Lp,∞ ). We norm these spaces by

We omit the weight if w ≡ 1 and we omit the Hilbert space if H = R. We
make the same definitions for Rd replaced by any measure space (S, µ) in
the obvious way.
We start by connecting the definitions of stochastic and γ-integral operators.
Proposition 3.4 (Deterministic characterization). Let X be a Banach space
and Y a UMD Banach space. Let p ∈ [2, ∞), T ∈ (0, ∞] and let w be a
weight on (0, T ). Then
isomorphically.

H
KW
(Lp ((0, T ), w)) = KγH (Lp ((0, T ), w))

Proof. The proof is completely straightforward from Theorem 3.1. Indeed
if K ∈ KγH (Lp ((0, T ), w)), then for f ∈ LpF (Ω × (0, T ), w; γ(H, X)) one has
kSK f (s)kLp (Ω;Y ) hp,Y kTK f (s)kLp (Ω;γ(0,T ;H,Y )) .

Therefore by Fubini’s theorem we have
(3.1)

kSK f kLp (Ω×(0,T ),w;Y )) hp,Y kTK f kLp (Ω;Lp (w;γ(0,T ;H,Y )))

≤ kKkKH

Conversely, taking f independent of Ω, a similar argument yields that K ∈
H (Lp ((0, T ), w)) implies K ∈ KH (Lp ((0, T ), w)).

In the next result we show that one can take H = R. The result extends
[AV20, Theorem 5.4] where a particular kernel was considered.
Proposition 3.5 (Independence of H). Let X and Y be a Banach spaces
and (S, µ) a measure space. Assume Y has type 2, let p ∈ [2, ∞) and let w
be a weight on S. Then
KγH (Lp (S, w)) = Kγ (Lp (S, w))

isomorphically.

KγH (Lp,∞ (S, w)) = Kγ (Lp,∞ (S, w))

Proof. By considering a 1-dimensional subspace of H, we immediately see
H and T R be the γ-integral operators
that ⊆ holds. For the converse let TK
K

follows analogously using Proposition 2.3(i) instead.

3.2. Truncations. We will now illustrate a major difference between stochastic and deterministic integral operators. Indeed, we will show that even
when the kernel K has a singularity, the “γ-integrals” converge absolutely.
In particular, we show that if we truncate the singularity of K, then the
operators associated to these truncations converge back to the operator associated to K without any regularity assumptions on K. This in contrast
to the deterministic setting (cf. [Gra14a, Section 5.3]). For this let X and
Y be Banach spaces and suppose that K : Rd × Rd → L(X, Y ) is strongly
measurable. We define for ε > 0
s, t ∈ Rd .

Kε (s, t) := K(s, t) 1B(0,1/ε)\B(0,ε) (s − t),

Let p ∈ [2, ∞) and w a weight on Rd . If Kε ∈ Kγ (Lp (Rd , w)) for all ε > 0
we define for f ∈ Lp (Rd , w; X) the maximal truncation operator
⋆
TK
f (s) := sup kTKε f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y )
ε>0

s ∈ Rd .

Proposition 3.6 (Truncations). Let X and Y Banach spaces and assume
that Y has type 2. Let p ∈ [2, ∞) and let w be a weight on Rd . Let
K : Rd × Rd → L(X, Y )

be strongly measurable such that Kε ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd , w)) for all ε > 0. Then
for f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) we have
⋆
TK
f (s) = kTK f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) ,

then TKε → TK in the strong operator

Proof. Fix f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) and s ∈ Rd . Assume that kTK f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) < ∞
and take ε > 0. Then by domination (see [HNVW17, Theorem 9.4.1])
(3.2)

kTKε f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) ≤ kTK f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y )

⋆ f (s) ≤ kT f (s)k
which yields TK

operator from L2 (Rd ) into Y . Moreover, for all ϕ ∈ L2 (Rd ) and y ∗ ∈ Y ∗ ,
the dominated convergence theorem yields that
hTK f (s)ϕ, y ∗ i = lim hTKε f (s)ϕ, y ∗ i.

Now the γ-Fatou lemma (See [HNVW17, Proposition 9.4.6]) yields
kTK f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) ≤ lim kTKε f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) = sup kTKε f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) .
ε→0

ε>0

where the equality follows again by domination. This concludes the proof
of the equality
⋆
TK
f (s) = kTK f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) .
By taking Lp -norms and using the density of Lp (Rd ; X) in Lp (Rd , w; X)
(see [Gra14a, Exercise 7.4.1]), we directly obtain
⋆
kKkK(Lp (Rd ,w)) = kTK
kLp (Rd ,w) ≤ sup kKε kK(Lp (Rd ,w)) ,
ε>0

and the converse inequality follows from (3.2). The estimate for Lp,∞ follows analogously. Finally, the strong convergence follows from (3.2), the
dominated convergence theorem and the γ-dominated convergence theorem
(see [HNVW17, Theorem 9.4.2]).

Next we prove a version of the above result for stochastic integral operators. For this let X and Y be Banach spaces, p ∈ [2, ∞) and w a

For the strong convergence note that by the proof of Proposition 3.4 we
have

Here the right-hand side for fixed ω ∈ Ω is independent of H by Proposition
3.5, so the strong convergence follows by Proposition 3.6 and the dominated
convergence theorem.

3.3. Necessary and sufficient conditions. Before we turn to more involved results in the subsequent sections, we first analyse the boundedness
of γ-integral operators in a few special cases. We start with a necessary
condition for TK to be bounded if K is of convolution type.
Proposition 3.8 (Necessary condition for convolution type). Let X and
Y be Banach spaces, assume that Y has type 2 and let p ∈ [2, ∞). Let
k : Rd → L(X, Y ) be strongly measurable and set K(s, t) := k(s − t). If
K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )), then for all x ∈ X
kt 7→ k(t)xkγ(Rd ;Y ) ≤ Cd kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) kxkX .
The same holds for R+ instead of Rd , where we set K(s, t) = 0 if s ≤ t.
Proof. Let r > 0, x ∈ X and set f = 1B(0,2r) ⊗x. Then for all s ∈ B(0, r),
Lr := kt 7→ k(t)xkγ(B(0,r);Y ) = kt 7→ k(s − t)xkγ(B(s,r);Y )

= kTK f (s)kγ(B(s,r);Y ) ≤ kTK f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) .

Therefore, for any 0 < λ < Lr we find that
λ ≤ λ |B(0, r)|−1/p {s ∈ B(0, r) : kT f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) > λ}

1/p

≤ |B(0, r)|−1/p kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) kf kLp (Rd ;X)
= Cd kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) kxkX .

Taking λ = 21 Lr , we find that Lr ≤ Cd kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) kxk. Now the
proposition follows by letting r → ∞ and applying the γ-Fatou lemma
(see [HNVW17, Proposition 9.4.6]). The proof for R+ is analogous, taking
s ∈ (r, 2r) instead.

Remark 3.9. If we replace Rd by (0, T ) with T ∈ (0, ∞) in Proposition 3.8,
we can deduce that
kt 7→ k(t)xkγ((0, 1 T );Y ) ≤ Cd kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (0,T )) kxkX .
2

For specific kernels one can stretch this estimate to the whole interval (0, T )
with a constant dependent on T , see [AV20, Lemma 4.2].
Next we provide some simple sufficient conditions on K for TK to be
bounded using Fubini’s theorem and Young’s inequality:
Proposition 3.10 (Simple sufficient conditions). Let X and Y be Banach
spaces, assume that Y has type 2 and suppose that K : Rd × Rd → L(X, Y )
is strongly measurable. Then the following hold:

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

19

(i) If there is an A0 > 0 such that
ks 7→ K(s, t)xkL2 (Rd ;Y ) ≤ A0 kxkX ,

t ∈ Rd ,

x ∈ X,

then K ∈ Kγ (L2 (Rd )) with kKkKγ (L2 (Rd )) ≤ τ2,Y A0 .
(ii) If kK(s, t)k ≤ k(s − t) for some k ∈ L2 (Rd ), then K ∈ Kγ (Lp (Rd )) for
all p ∈ [2, ∞) with kKkKγ (Lp (Rd )) ≤ τ2,Y kkkL2 (Rd ) .

The same holds for (0, T ) with T ∈ (0, ∞] instead of Rd , where K(s, t) = 0
if s ≤ t.
Proof. For (i) we have by Lemma 2.1 that

Z

kTK f (s)kγ(Rd ;Y ) ≤ τ2,Y

Taking L2 -norms on both sides and applying Fubini’s theorem we obtain

ks 7→ K(s, t)f (t)k2L2 (Rd ;Y ) dt
kTK f kL2 (Rd ;γ(Rd ;Y )) ≤ τ2,Y

s ∈ Rd .

Taking Lp -norms on both sides and applying Young’s inequality we obtain
kTK f kLp (Rd ;γ(Rd ;Y )) ≤ τ2,Y kkkL2 (Rd ) kf kLp (Rd ;X) .
The (0, T ) case follows similarly, where we extend K and f by 0 outside

(0, T ) to apply Young’s inequality for (ii).

If Y is a Hilbert space and K is of convolution type, we can actually characterize the boundedness of TK , since in this case γ(Rd ; Y ) = L2 (Rd ; Y ). In
Corollaries 5.10 and 6.5 the following result will be improved under regularity conditions on K.
Corollary 3.11. Let X be a Banach space and Y be a Hilbert space. Let
k : Rd → L(X, Y ) be strongly measurable and set K(s, t) := k(s − t). Then
the following hold:
(i) K ∈ Kγ (L2 (Rd )) if and only if kt 7→ k(t)xkL2 (Rd ;Y ) . kxkX .
(ii) If K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) for some p ∈ [2, ∞), then K ∈ Kγ (Lq (Rd )) for
all q ∈ [2, p).

The same hold for (0, T ) with T ∈ (0, ∞] instead of Rd , where we set
K(s, t) = 0 if s ≤ t.
Proof. By [HNVW17, Proposition 9.2.9] one has for all t ∈ Rd that
ks 7→ K(s, t)xkL2 (Rd ;Y ) = ks 7→ k(s)xkL2 (Rd ;Y ) = ks 7→ k(s)xkγ(Rd ;Y ) ,
from which (i) follows using by Proposition 3.8 and 3.10(i). Part (ii) follows
by combining Proposition 3.8, part (i) and the Marcinkiewicz interpolation
theorem (see [HNVW16, Theorem 2.23]).

3.4. Scalar kernels. If we allow X to be any Banach space with type 2, but
restrict K to be scalar-valued, we can easily characterize the boundedness
of TK if K is of convolution type. This explains why we study the more
interesting operator-valued case.
Proposition 3.12. Let X be a Banach space with type 2, let p ∈ [2, ∞), let
k : Rd → K be measurable and set K(s, t) := k(s − t). Then TK is bounded
from Lp (Rd ; X) to Lp (Rd ; γ(Rd ; X)) if and only if k ∈ L2 (Rd ). Moreover,
in this case kKkKγ (Lp (Rd )) ≤ τ2,X kkkL2 (Rd ) .
Proof. Since k is scalar-valued, we have for x ∈ X
ks 7→ k(s)xkγ(Rd ;X) = kxkX kkkL2 (Rd ) .
Therefore the result follows from Proposition 3.8 and Proposition 3.10(ii).

In the scalar case, i.e. X = Y = K, the Lp -boundedness of TK can also be
well-understood from existing theory for non-convolution kernels. Indeed,
in this case K ∈ Kγ (Lp (Rd )) is equivalent to

ds ≤ C p kgkpLp/2 (Rd ) ,

where we have set g(t) = |f (t)|2 . The validity of the above estimate is
completely characterized by the optimality of Schur’s lemma (see [Gra14b,
Appendix A.2]) applied to the positive kernel |K(s, t)|2 . Moreover, in this
case TK is also bounded in the vector-valued setting where X = Y has type
2, since by Lemma 2.1

where g(t) =
Conversely, by considering a one-dimensional subspace of X, one obtains that (3.3) is also necessary.

Example 3.13.
1
(i) Let d = 1 and K(s, t) = (s+t)
1/2 1s,t>0 . Then by [Gar07, Theorem
5.10.1] we know that K ∈ Kγ (Lp (R)) if and only if p ∈ (2, ∞). More
generally for 1 ≤ j ≤ d set
Kj (s, t) :=

(sj + tj )1/2

s+t

(d+1)/2

1sj ,tj >0 ,

s, t ∈ Rd .

Then we know by [Osȩ17, Theorem 1] that Kj ∈ Kγ (Lp (Rd )) if and
only if p ∈ (2, ∞).
1
(ii) If K(s, t) = |s−t|
/ Kγ (Lp (R)), which is
1/2 , then for all p ∈ [2, ∞), K ∈
immediate from Proposition 3.8.
Example 3.13(ii) can be seen as the analog of the Hilbert transform. It is
not bounded for any p ∈ [2, ∞) due to the lack of cancellation in the stochastic, scalar-valued setting. This further exemplifies the difference between the
deterministic and the stochastic theory.

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

21

Remark 3.14. The scalar case also shows why we only consider p ∈ [2, ∞).
Boundedness for p < 2 holds if and only if K ≡ 0 (see [Kal78]). This
also holds for the operator-valued case since Lp -boundedness with p < 2
would imply that hK(t, s)x, y ∗ i = 0 a.e. for all x ∈ X and y ∗ ∈ Y ∗ . By
strong measurability of (t, s) 7→ K(t, s)x this implies that for all x ∈ X,
K(t, s)x ≡ 0. Thus by density of Lp (Rd ) ⊗ X in Lp (Rd ; X), we find that
K(s, t)f (t) = 0.
4. Singular γ-kernels of Hörmander and Dini type
Motivated by the connection between stochastic integral operators and γintegral operators proven in Proposition 3.4 and Proposition 3.5, we will now
start the systematic study of the Kγ -classes for more involved kernels than
treated in Subsection 3.3. In particular, we will develop a γ-version of the
Calderón–Zygmund theory for (deterministic) singular integral operators.
This will first be done on Rd and afterwards in Section 7 we will point
out how our arguments carry over to the more general setting of spaces of
homogeneous type, which for example includes the (0, T )-case for T ∈ (0, ∞].
Let us first define our assumptions on the γ-kernels K:
Definition 4.1. Let X, Y be a Banach spaces and let K : Rd ×Rd → L(X, Y )
be strongly measurable.
• We say that K is a 2-Hörmander kernel if for every ball B ⊆ Rd we
have
1/2
Z

kK(s, t) − K(s′ , t)k2 dt

(4.2)
kK(s, t) − K(s, t′ )k2 ds
≤C
t, t′ ∈ B
2
Rd \B
for some constant C > 0 independent of B. The least admissible C
will be denoted by kKk2 -Hörm .
• We say that K is an (ω, 2)-Dini kernel if
 |s − s′ | 
1
1
(4.3) kK(s, t) − K(s′ , t)k ≤ ω
|s − s′ | ≤ |s − t|,
|s − t| |s − t|d/2

|t − t′ | ≤ |s − t|,
(4.4) kK(s, t) − K(s, t′ )k ≤ ω
|s − t| |s − t|d/2
2
where ω : [0, 1] → [0, ∞) is increasing, subadditive, ω(0) = 0 and
Z 1
dr 1/2
< ∞.
kKk(ω,2) -Dini :=
ω(r)2
r
0

• We say that K is an (ǫ, 2)-standard kernel if K is an (ω, 2)-Dini kernel
with ω(r) = Cr ǫ for some ǫ ∈ (0, 1] and we set
kKk(ǫ,2) -std := kKk(ω,2) -Dini .
If K is of convolution type, i.e. if K(s, t) = k(s − t) for some k : Rd →
L(X, Y ), the Hörmander and Dini conditions in Definition 4.1 can be reformulated using a change of variables. Indeed, (4.1) and (4.2) both simplify

An Lr -variant of (4.5) already appeared in [Hör60].
By definition an (ǫ, 2)-standard kernel is also an (ω, 2)-Dini kernel. As in
the deterministic setting an (ω, 2)-Dini kernel is also an 2-Hörmander kernel.
The proof is a straightforward adaptation of the proof in the deteministic
setting. For convenience of the reader we include the details.
Lemma 4.2. Let X, Y be a Banach spaces and suppose that K : Rd × Rd →
L(X, Y ) is an (ω, 2)-Dini kernel. Then K is a 2-Hörmander kernel with
kKk2 -Hörm ≤ Cd kKk(ω,2) -Dini .
Proof. We will only show (4.1), as (4.2) follows analogously. Let B =
B(s, r) ⊆ Rd be a ball and take s1 , s2 ∈ 12 B. Then |s − sj | ≤ 21 r ≤ 12 |s − t|
for any t ∈ Rd \ B, so

If K is differentiable, we can check the standard kernel conditions in terms
of the derivatives of the kernel.
Lemma 4.3. Let X and Y be a Banach spaces and let


K ∈ C 1 Rd × Rd \ {(s, s) : s ∈ Rd }; L(X, Y ) .

Suppose that there is a constant A0 > 0 such that
∂sα K(s, t) ≤ A0 · |s − t|−d/2−1

∂tα K(s, t) ≤ A0 · |s − t|−d/2−1

|α| = 1, s 6= t,
|α| = 1, s 6= t.

Then K is a (1, 2)-standard kernel with kKk(1,2) -std ≤ Cd A0 .

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

23

Proof. We will prove (4.3), the proof of (4.4) is analogous. Take s, s′ , t ∈ Rd
such that 0 < |s − s′ | ≤ 12 |s − t|. Then we have for all λ ∈ [0, 1]
|s − t − λ(s − s′ )| ≥ |s − t| − |λ(s − s′ )| ≥ |s − t| − |s − s′ | ≥

If K is of convolution type, a sufficient condition for (4.1), (4.2), (4.3) and
(4.4) can also be formulated in terms of smoothness of the Fourier transform
of k. For the usual Hörmander and Dini kernels this is classical. The L2 variants (or even the Lr -variants) in Definition 4.1 can be treated by similar
methods (see e.g. [RV17, Section 5.1]).
We end this section with a sufficient condition for the standard kernel
conditions in terms of fractional smoothness on R.
Lemma 4.4. Let Φ : R+ → L(X, Y ) be strongly measurable and suppose
there exists a constant A0 > 0 and an ǫ ∈ (0, 21 ) such that
1

5. Extrapolation for γ-integral operators
In this section we will prove the first results regarding the extrapolation
of the Lp -boundedness of an γ-integral operator TK to the Lq -boundedness
of TK for all q ∈ (2, ∞) under a 2-Hörmander assumption on K. We will
also obtain a weak L2 -endpoint and a BMO-endpoint result.
5.1. Extrapolation for 2 < q < p. Let us start our analysis with an
extrapolation result downwards. We will show that if K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd ))
satisfies the 2-Hörmander condition, then also K ∈ Kγ (Lq (Rd )) for all q ∈
(2, p) and K ∈ Kγ (L2,∞ (Rd )). For this we will adapt the Calderón-Zygmund
decomposition technique for singular integral operators to the γ-case. Our
main tool will be the following L2 -Calderón–Zygmund decomposition.
Proposition 5.1 (L2 -Calderón–Zygmund decomposition). Let X be a Banach space. For every f ∈ L2 (Rd ; X) and λ > 0 there exists a decomposition
f = g + b with
kgkL∞ (Rd ;X) ≤ 2d/2 λ,
P
and b = j bj with
supp bj ⊆ Qj

kbj k2L2 (Rd ;X) ≤ 2d+2 kf k2L2 (Rd ;X)

For the proof in the case X = C we refer to [Gra14a, Exercise 5.3.8], where
the more general Lq -Calderón–Zygmund decomposition for any q ∈ [1, ∞)
is shown. The proof carries over verbatim to the vector-valued setting,
replacing absolute values by norms.
Note that in the deterministic setting the functions bRj in a Calderón–
Zygmund decomposition are usually also taken such that Qk bj = 0, but we
will not be able to use this property for γ-integral operators. Instead we
use the L2 -Calderón–Zygmund decomposition in a way that is inspired by
[DM99], which builds upon ideas developed in [DR96, Fef70, Heb90].
Theorem 5.2 (Extrapolation downwards). Let X and Y be Banach spaces
with type 2, let p ∈ [2, ∞) and suppose that K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) satisfies the
2-Hörmander condition. Then
(i) K ∈ Kγ (Lq (Rd )) for all q ∈ (2, p) with


kKkKγ (Lq (Rd )) ≤ Cp,q,d τ2,X τ2,Y kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + τ2,Y kKk2 -Hörm .
(ii) K ∈ Kγ (L2,∞ (Rd )) with


kKkKγ (L2,∞ (Rd )) ≤ Cp,d τ2,X τ2,Y kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + τ2,Y kKk2 -Hörm .

Proof. It suffices to show (ii), as (i) then follows directly from the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem, see e.g. [HNVW16, Theorem 2.2.3].
Let f ∈ L2 (Rd ; X) ∩ Lp (Rd ; X) be compactly supported, λ > 0 and set
A0 := kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) . Let f = g + b be the L2 -Calderón–Zygmund decomposition of f at level µλ for some µ > 0 to be chosen later. Then we
have

(5.1) kgkLp (Rd ;X) ≤ kgkL∞ (Rd ;X) kgkL2 (Rd ;X) ≤ 2 µλ
kf k2L2 (Rd ;X) ,

so in particular g ∈ Lp (Rd ; X). It follows that b = f − g ∈ Lp (Rd ; X), and
thus
TK f = TK g + TK b
is well-defined.
To estimate the L2,∞ (Rd ; γ(Rd ; Y ))-norm of TK f we need to analyse the
size of {kTK f kγ(Rd ;Y ) > λ}. We split as follows:
(5.2)



kTK f kγ(Rd ;Y ) > λ ≤ kTK gkγ(Rd ;Y ) > λ2 + kTK bkγ(Rd ;Y ) > λ2 .

For the term with the “good” part g we have by our assumption on TK and
(5.1) that

For the term with the “bad” part b, let Qj be the cube corresponding to
bj with center sj and diameter 2rj . SetSBj := B(sj , rj ), then Qj ⊆ Bj and
|Bj | ≤ Cd |Qj |. Set Bj′ = 4Bj and O := j Bj′ .
As a preparation for our estimates we will define some auxiliary operators.
For r > 0 define
1
ψr (s, t) :=
1B(t,r) (s),
s, t ∈ Rd .
|B(t, r)|1/2
Note that kψr (·, t)kL2 (Rd ) = 1 for all t ∈ Rd and

Tψ h(s) := (t, t′ ) 7→ K(s, t)ψ(t′ , t)h(t) .

Note that since TK h(s) ∈ γ(Rd ; Y ) by assumption, we also have Tψ h(s) ∈
L(L2 (Rd × Rd ), Y ). Moreover since kψ(·, t)kL2 (Rd ) = 1 we have

Finally let
TeK : γ(Rd ; Lp (Rd ; X)) → γ(Rd ; Lp,∞ (Rd ; γ(Rd ; Y )))

be the canonical extension of TK , which is trivially bounded with norm A0 .

bounded as an operator

weak L2 -endpoint.

Remark 5.3. In general one can not expect TK ∈ Kγ (L2 (Rd )) in Theorem
5.2 , which is already clear from the scalar case. For instance the kernel
1
K(s, t) = (s+t)
1/2 1s,t>0 of Example 3.13 is a 2-Hörmander kernel. However,
p
L -boundedness holds only for p ∈ (2, ∞).
5.2. Extrapolation for p < q < ∞. We now turn our attention to extrapolation upwards for γ-integral operator. We will show that if K ∈
Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) satisfies the 2-Hörmander condition, then also K ∈ Kγ (Lq (Rd ))
for all q ∈ (p, ∞) and we will prove a BMO-endpoint result.
Theorem 5.4 (Extrapolation upwards). Let X and Y be Banach spaces and
assume that Y has type 2. Let p ∈ [2, ∞) and suppose K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd ))
satisfies the 2-Hörmander condition. Then
(i) K ∈ Kγ (Lq (Rd )) for all q ∈ (p, ∞) with


kKkKγ (Lq (Rd )) ≤ Cp,q,d kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + τ2,Y kKk2 -Hörm .
(ii) There exists a TeK ∈ L(L∞ (Rd ; X), BMO(Rd ; γ(Rd ; Y ))) such that


TeK L∞ →BMO ≤ Cp,d kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + τ2,Y kKk2 -Hörm .
and TeK f − TK f is constant for all f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) ∩ L∞ (Rd ; X).

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

Remark 5.5. The extension of TK to all f ∈ L∞ (Rd ; X) in Theorem 5.4(ii)
is not in the traditional sense, as even for f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) ∩ L∞ (Rd ; X) the
extension TeK f may not coincide with TK f . However, as TeK f and TK f only
differ by a constant in this case, they represent the same function in the
Banach space
BMO(Rd ; γ(Rd ; Y ))/γ(Rd ; Y ).
Furthermore we can not claim uniqueness, as Lp (Rd ; X) ∩ L∞ (Rd ; X) is not
dense in L∞ (Rd ; X)
In order to prove Theorem 5.4, we need to introduce local versions of the
operator TK . For any cube Q ⊆ Rd we define the local operator
Q
: L∞ (Rd ; X) → Lp (Q; γ(Rd ; Y ))
TK

for s ∈ Q and ϕ ∈ L2 (Rd ) by

These operators satisfy the following properties:

Lemma 5.6. Let X and Y and be Banach spaces and assume that Y has type
2. Let p ∈ [2, ∞) and suppose K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) satisfies the 2-Hörmander

(i) for all f ∈ L∞ (Rd ; X) we have

we have that

Using the properties of these local operators TK
we can prove an L∞ estimate of TK involving the sharp maximal operator.

Proposition 5.7. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and assume that Y has
type 2. Let p ∈ [2, ∞) and suppose K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) satisfies the 2Hörmander condition. Then for all f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) ∩ L∞ (Rd ; X) we have

M # TK f L∞ (Rd ) ≤ Cd kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + τ2,Y kKk2 -Hörm kf kL∞ (Rd ;X) .

M # TK f L∞ (Rd ) ≤ Cd (kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + τ2,Y kKk2 -Hörm )kf kL∞ (Rd ;X) ,
which proves the proposition.



Using Proposition 5.7, the proof of Theorem 5.4(i) is now a straightforward application of Stampacchia interpolation (see e.g. [GR85, Theorem
II.3.7]).
Proof of Theorem 5.4(i). Let f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) ∩ L∞ (Rd ; X). Note that trivially M # f ≤ 2 M (kf kγ(Rd ;Y ) ), so by Lemma 2.5 we know that M # is
bounded from Lp,∞ (Rd ; γ(Rd ; Y )) to Lp,∞(Rd ). Thus
M # (TK f )

Lp,∞ (Rd )

≤ Cp,d TK f

Lp,∞ (Rd ;γ(Rd ;Y ))

≤ Cp,d kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) kf kLp (Rd ;X) .
Moreover by Proposition 5.7 we know that


M # TK f L∞ (Rd ) ≤ Cp,d kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + τ2,Y kKk2 -Hörm kf kL∞ (Rd ;X) ,

We can therefore apply the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem (see e.g.
[HNVW16, Theorem 2.2.3]), to conclude that for all f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) ∩
Lq (Rd ; X) we have

M # (TK f ) Lq (Rd ) ≤ Cp,q,d kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + τ2,Y kKk2 -Hörm kf kLq (Rd ;X) .
By Lemma 2.6 we deduce

kTK f kLq (Rd ;γ(Rd ;Y )) ≤ Cq,d M # (TK f )

Lq (Rd )


≤ Cp,q,d kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + τ2,Y kKk2 -Hörm kf kLq (Rd ;X) .

for all f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) ∩ Lq (Rd ; X). As this is a dense subspace of Lq (Rd ; X),
assertion (i) of Theorem 5.4 follows.

Assertion (ii) of Theorem 5.4 does not follow directly from Proposition
5.7, since Lp (Rd ; X) ∩ L∞ (Rd ; X) is not dense in L∞ (Rd ; X) and therefore
the extension of TK to all functions in L∞ (Rd ; X) is a nontrivial matter.
Proof of Theorem 5.4(ii). Let (Qk )∞
k=1 be an increasing sequence of cubes
S∞

such that k=1 Qk = R . For f ∈ L∞ (Rd ; X) define
Z
Qk

Then TeK f ∈ L1loc (Rd ; γ(Rd ; Y )) is well-defined. Indeed, by Lemma 5.6(ii) we
Qk
f ∈ L1 (Qk ; γ(Rd ; Y )), so in particular the average over Q1 is wellhave TK
defined. Moreover if j > k, then by Lemma 5.6(iii) there is a c ∈ γ(Rd ; Y )

thus the definition of TeK f (s) is independent of the choice of Qk ∋ s.
If f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) ∩ L∞ (Rd ; X), then for any k ∈ N there exist c1 , c2 ∈
γ(Rd ; Y ) such that for a.e. s ∈ Qk
Qk
f (s) − TK f (s) = c1 ,

f (s) − TeK f (s) = c2

It remains to show that TeK f ∈ BMO(Rd ; X) with the claimed norm
estimate. Let Q ⊆ Rd be any cube and fix k ∈ N such that Q ⊆ Qk . By
Lemma 5.6(iii) there exists a c3 ∈ γ(Rd ; Y ) such that for a.e. s ∈ Q

Remark 5.8. By inspection of the proof it can easily be seen that for the
extrapolation down in Theorem 5.2 one only needs

which is implied by (4.2) of the 2-Hörmander condition. For the extrapolation up in Theorem 5.4 one only needs the left hand side of (5.5) to be
bounded, which is implied by (4.1) of the 2-Hörmander condition.
Remark 5.9.
• In [KK16] a real-valued extrapolation result was proved under a parabolic Hörmander condition which allows one to extend L2 (Ω×R+ ×D)boundedness to Lp (Ω × R+ × D)-boundedness. In applications to
SPDEs this result can be combined with ours to extrapolate L2 (Ω ×
R+ × D)-boundedness to Lp (Ω × R+ ; Lq (D))-boundedness for all p ∈
(2, ∞) and q ∈ [2, ∞) (see Examples 8.9 and 8.17).
• Another type of BMO end-point estimate was obtained in [Kim15], but
the result seems incomparable with ours.
Corollary 5.10 (γ-convolution operator with values in a Hilbert space). Let
X be a Banach space and Y be a Hilbert space. Suppose k : Rd → L(X, Y )
is strongly measurable and satisfies the 2-Hörmander condition in (4.5). Let
K(s, t) = k(s − t). Then the following are equivalent:
(i) kt 7→ k(t)xkL2 (Rd ;Y ) ≤ A0 kxk for some A0 > 0;
(ii) K ∈ Kγ (Lp (Rd )) for all p ∈ [2, ∞).
(iii) K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) for some p ∈ [2, ∞);

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

33

In particular we have for all p ∈ [2, ∞) and A0 as in (i):

kKkKγ (Lp (Rd )) ≤ Cp,d (A0 + kKk2 -Hörm ).

Proof. The implication (i) ⇒ (ii) for p = 2 follows from Propostion 3.10(i)
and for p ∈ (2, ∞) we can apply Theorem 5.4. The implication (ii) ⇒ (iii)
is trivial and (iii) ⇒ (i) follows from Proposition 3.8.

6. Sparse domination for γ-integral operators
In this section we will obtain weighted bounds for a γ-integral operator
TK under an (ω, 2)-Dini condition on K. We will deduce these weighted
bounds by estimating the operator TK pointwise by a much simpler operator.
These simpler operators satisfy weighted bounds, which then imply weighted
bounds for TK .
Let us start by defining these simpler operators. We say that a collection
of cubes S in Rd is η-sparse for some η ∈ (0, 1) if for every Q ∈ S there exists
an EQ ⊆ Q such that |ES | ≥ η|S| and such that the collection {EQ : Q ∈ S}
is pairwise disjoint. Typically η will only depend on the dimension d. We
will dominate the γ-integral operators by operators of the form
 1/2
 X Z
kf k2X 1Q
f 7→
Q∈S

Q

for some η-sparse collection of cubes S. These sparse operators are wellknown to satisfy weighted bounds, see [Lor19, Proposition 4.1].
The sparse domination approach was developed in order to prove the
so called A2 -conjecture, first solved by Hytönen in [Hyt12]. The particular
result we need stems from Lacey’s simple proof of the A2 -conjecture [Lac17],
further clarified and simplified by Lerner [Ler16] and later by Lerner and
Ombrosi [LO19]. We will use a version of this result by the first author
[Lor19], which is adapted to our stochastic vector-valued setting. In order
to use this result we need to study a grand maximal truncation operator
associated to the operator that we wish to dominate by a sparse operator.
Let X and Y be Banach spaces, p ∈ [1, ∞) and let T be a bounded
operator from Lp (Rd ; X) to Lp,∞(Rd ; Y ). Define for f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X), α ≥ 1
and s ∈ Rd

where the first supremum is taken over all balls B ⊆ Rd containing s and
αB is the dilation of B by a factor α. The following theorem is a special
case of [Lor19, Theorem 1.1].
Theorem 6.1 (Abstract sparse domination). Let X and Y be a Banach
spaces, p, r ∈ [1, ∞) and α ≥ 6. Assume the following conditions:
• T is a bounded linear operator from Lp (Rd ; X) to Lp,∞ (Rd ; Y ).

In order to apply this theorem on a K ∈ Kγ (Lp (Rd )) we need to check
weak L2 -boundedness of TK and M#
TK ,α and we need to check equation (6.1)

with r = 2. For a (ω, 2)-Dini kernel the boundedness of M#
TK ,α is quite easy
to check for α = 6:

Lemma 6.2 (Boundedness of grand maximal truncation operator). Let X
and Y be a Banach spaces and assume that Y has type 2. Let p ∈ [2, ∞)
and suppose K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) satisfies the (ω, 2)-Dini condition. Then for
any f ∈ Lp (Rd ; X) we have

s′ , s′′ ∈ B and let ε = 4ρ. Then |s′ − s′′ | ≤ 21 ε and for any t ∈ Rd \ 6B we
have |s′ − t| > ε. Therefore applying Lemma 2.1 and using the (ω, 2)-Dini
condition we obtain that

We can now prove sparse domination, and thus also weighted boundedness, for the γ-integral operators
Theorem 6.3 (Sparse domination for γ-integral operators). Let X and
Y be Banach spaces with type 2. Let p ∈ [2, ∞) and and suppose K ∈
Kγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) satisfies the (ω, 2)-Dini condition. Then there is an η ∈ (0, 1)
such that for every compactly supported f ∈ L2 (Rd ; X) there exists a η-sparse
collection of cubes S such that

with cK := kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (Rd )) + kKk(ω,2) -Dini . In particular:

(i) K ∈ Kγ (Lq (Rd , w)) for all q ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ Aq/2 with

Proof. Since K is an (ω, 2)-Dini kernel, it is also a 2-Hörmander kernel by
Lemma 4.2 with
kKk2 -Hörm ≤ Cp,d kKk(ω,2) -Dini .
Therefore by Theorem 5.2 we know that T is bounded from L2 (Rd ; X) to
L2,∞ (Rd ; γ(Rd ; Y )) with norm

Moreover for f1 , · · · , fn ∈ L2 (Rd ; X) with disjoint support we have for a.e.

(6.1) with r = 2 follows from Lemma 2.2. The sparse domination therefore
follows by applying Theorem 6.1 to TK . The weighted bounds follow directly
from [Lor19, Proposition 4.1] and the density of compactly supported L2 functions in Lq (Rd , w; X) for all q ∈ [2, ∞).

(ii) Ap/2 is the largest class of weights one can expect in Theorem 6.3, since
in the case that X = Y = K and K(s, t) = k(s − t), Theorem 6.3 can
be reduced to a statement about deterministic convolution operators
with positive kernel (see Subsection 3.4). It is standard to check that
the weighted boundedness of for example
Z

λd e−λ|s−t| f (t) dt,
s ∈ Rd ,
T f (s)
Rd

for all λ ∈ R+ implies the Ap -condition, see e.g. [Gra14a, Section
7.1.1]. Also the dependence on the weight characteristic is sharp, see
Proposition 6.6 below

Under a Dini type condition we obtain the following further characterization if Y is a Hilbert space. The proof is immediate from Corollary 5.10,
Theorem 6.3 and Remark 6.4(i).
Corollary 6.5. Let X be a Banach space and Y be a Hilbert space. Suppose
k : Rd → L(X, Y ) is strongly measurable and satisfies the (ω, 2)-Dini condition in (4.6). Let K(s, t) := k(s − t). Then statements (i)–(iii) in Corollary
5.10 are equivalent to
(iv) K ∈ Kγ (Lp (Rd , w)) for all p ∈ (2, ∞) and all w ∈ Ap/2 .

In particular we have for all p ∈ (2, ∞), w ∈ Ap/2 and A0 as in (i) of
Corollary 5.10:

We will show next that the dependence on the weight characteristic
[w]Ap/2 in the bounds for TK in Theorem 6.3 is actually optimal. Therefore Theorem 6.3 can be thought of as a γ-analog of the A2 -theorem in the
deterministic setting.
Proposition 6.6. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and p ∈ (2, ∞) and
β ≥ 0. There exists a kernel K : Rd → L(X, Y ) satisfying the assumptions
of Theorem 6.3 such that if for all w ∈ Ap/2 we have

7. Extension to spaces of homogeneous type
In this section we will describe how Sections 4-6 can be generalized from
to a space of homogeneous type (S, d, µ). This will be quite useful in our
applications, as we will often want to take S = R+ or S = (0, T ) with the
Euclidean metric and the Lebesgue measure. While these examples are in a
sense trivial spaces of homogeneous type, they do not follow directly from
our theory on Rd .
A space of homogeneous type (S, d, µ), originally introduced by Coifman
and Weiss in [CW71], is a set S equipped with a quasimetric d, i.e. a metric
which satisfies

s, t, u ∈ S
d(s, t) ≤ cd d(s, u) + d(u, t) ,
Rd

for some cd ≥ 1 instead of the triangle inequality, and a Borel measure µ
that satisfies the doubling property, i.e.


µ B(s, 2r) ≤ cµ µ B(s, r) ,
s ∈ S, r > 0

for some cµ ≥ 1. In addition we assume that all balls B ⊆ S are Borel sets
and that we have 0 < µ(B) < ∞. As µ is a Borel measure the Lebesgue
differentiation theorem holds and Cc (S) is dense in Lp (S) for all p ∈ [1, ∞),
see [AM15, Theorem 3.14] for the details.

We will now describe how Sections 4-6 can be adapted to spaces of homogeneous type. When we say that a result remains valid when we replace
Rd with a space of homogeneous type (S, d, µ), we mean implicitly that all

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

38

cubes are replaced by balls with the same center and diameter and that
the dependence on the dimension d of the involved constants is replaced by
dependence on the quasimetric constant cd and the doubling constant cµ .
• The weighted bounds for the Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator in
Lemma 2.5 are still valid, since we can do a similar covering lemma
argument as we did for Rd , see [HK12, Theorem 4.1].
• The definition of the 2-Hörmander condition carries over directly to
spaces of homogeneous type. For the (ω, 2)-Dini we replace |s − t|d by
µ(B(s, d(s, t))) in (4.3) and by µ(B(t, d(t, s))) in (4.4).
• Lemma 4.2 remains valid in general spaces of homogeneous type and
Lemma 4.3 as well if S is a convex subset of Rd with the Euclidean
distance and the Lebesgue measure. More generally, Lemma 4.3 also
remains valid if S is a smooth domain in Rd , as one can then locally
reduce to the Rd+ case. Lemma 4.4 remains true for (0, T ) with T ∈
(0, ∞].
• Theorem 5.2 remains valid. The main part of the proof that should be
adapted, is the L2 -Calderón–Zygmund decomposition. This decomposition in spaces of homogeneous type can be found in [BK03, Theorem
3.1] in the case X = C and the proof again carries over verbatim to
the vector-valued setting. Note that this decomposition at level λ > 0
holds only when
1/2

where the right hand side is of course zero if µ(S) = ∞. So if µ(S) < ∞
we need another argument in the proof of Theorem 5.2 in the case

But this case is trivial, since

The other difference in this decomposition is that we do not obtain a
disjoint decomposition of the “bad” part b, but a decomposition with
bounded overlap. One can easily check that this does not cause any
problems in our proof. For instance in the inequality

1/p

one needs to add a constant depending on the amount of overlap.
• Theorem 5.4 also remains valid. The main difficulty here is the FeffermannStein theorem (Lemma 2.6) in spaces of homogeneous type, which can
be found in [Mar04, Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 4.2] or [DK18, Theorem 2.4]. When µ(S) < ∞, this requires some extra care, since we
then have

′
kf kLq (Rd ) .q,cd ,cµ kM # f kLq (Rd ) + µ(S)−1/q kf kL1 (Rd ) .
In the proof of Theorem 5.4 this means that we also need to estimate
′
µ(S)−1/q kTK f kL1 (S) in terms of kf kLq (Rd ;X) . By the assumption that

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

K ∈ Kγ (Lp,∞ (S)), Hölder’s inequality and (2.4) we have

≤ Cp µ(S)1/p −1/q kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (S;X)) kf kLp (S;X)

≤ Cp kKkKγ (Lp,∞ (S)) kf kLq (S;X) ,

which is exactly the required estimate.
• The proof of Theorem 6.3 relies completely on the results in [Lor19],
which are proven in a space of homogeneous type. Therefore Theorem
6.3 remains valid.
• Corollary 5.10 and Corollary 6.5 remain valid on R+ .
8. Applications to stochastic maximal regularity
We will now apply our results from Sections 5-7 to obtain stochastic
maximal regularity of various SPDE’s. For this we will first need some
background on sectorial operators.
8.1. Sectorial operators. Let X be a Banach space and define
Σϕ = {z ∈ C \ {0} : | arg(z)| < ϕ}.

A closed operator (A, D(A)) on X will be called sectorial if there is a ϕ ∈
[0, π) such that C \ Σϕ ⊆ ρ(A) and there is a constant A0 > 0 such that
k(λ − A)−1 k ≤ A0 /|λ|, λ ∈ C \ Σϕ .

The infimum over all such ϕ is called the angle of sectoriality of A. For details on sectorial operators we refer to [EN00, Haa06, Yag10]. In particular,
recall that for a sectorial operator one can define the fractional powers Aα
for α ∈ R. For θ > 0 and p ∈ [1, ∞], the spaces DA (θ, p) are defined by
DA (θ, p) = (X, D(An ))θ/n,p ,

where n ∈ N is the least integer larger than θ. In the above we used the
real interpolation method. The complex interpolation method will be used
as well, and our notation for this will be [X, D(A)]θ . For details on interpolation we refer to [Tri78, Haa06, Lun95].
8.2. Setting. Many stochastic PDEs can be analysed as stochastic evolution equations by using functional analytic tools. We refer to the monograph
[DZ14] and the papers [Brz97, NVW08].
Consider the following linear stochastic evolution equation on a Banach
space X:
(
du + Au dt = G dWH
on R+ ,
(8.1)
u(0) = 0.
Here (A(t))t∈R+ is a family of closed operators on X, WH is H-cylindrical
Brownian motion and G : R+ × Ω → γ(H, X) is adapted to F . In this paper we will focus on linear equations. Nonlinear stochastic evolution equations can be studied by using suitable estimates for the linear case (see
[Brz97, DZ14]). In particular, stochastic maximal regularity estimates have
been applied to nonlinear SPDEs in [Agr18, Brz95, Hor19, KK18, Kry99,
NVW12a, PV19].

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

The mild solution to (8.1) is given by
Z s
S(t, s)G(s) dWH (s),
u(t) = S ⋄ G(t) :=
0

40

t ∈ R+ .

Here we have assumed that −A generates the strongly continuous evolution family (S(t, s))0≤s≤t . In the case A does not depend on time, one has
that S(t, s) = e−(t−s)A is a strongly continuous semigroup. For details and
unexplained terminology on semigroups and evolution families we refer to
[EN00, Lun95, Paz83, Tan79, Yag10].
Definition 8.1 (Stochastic maximal regularity). Let X be a UMD Banach
space with type 2, p ∈ [2, ∞) and let w be a weight on R+ . Let Y ֒→ X.
We say that A has stochastic maximal Lp (w; Y )-regularity and write A ∈
SMR(Lp (w; Y )) if for all G ∈ LpF (Ω × R+ , w; γ(H, X)) the mild solution u
to (8.1) satisfies
(8.2)

kukLp (Ω×R+ ,w;Y ) ≤ C kGkLp (Ω×R+ ,w;γ(H,X)) .

We omit the weight if w ≡ 1.

Written out explicitly the estimate (8.2) becomes

Y = [X, D(A)] 1

and

Y = (X, D(A)) 1 ,r , r ∈ [2, ∞),

λ)1/2 )

and the fractional domain spaces Y = D((A +
for λ such that A + λ
is sectorial. In several places we will use the homogenous fractional domain
space Ḋ((A + λ)1/2 ) with norm
kxkḊ((A+λ)1/2 ) = k(A + λ)1/2 xkX .
Note that if A + λ is invertible, then Ḋ((A + λ)1/2 ) = D((A + λ)1/2 ).
In [NVW12b] it has been shown that under certain geometric restrictions
on X, the boundedness of the H ∞ -calculus of angle < π/2 of A (see [Haa06,
HNVW17]) implies
1
A ∈ SMR(Lp (Ḋ(A 2 ))).
Extensions to the case of time-dependent A have been obtained in [PV19].
Abstract properties of stochastic maximal regularity have been studied in
[AV20], where in particular it was shown that if A is time-independent and
1
A ∈ SMR(Lp (D(A 2 ))), then −A generates an exponentially stable analytic
semigroup. In case A has a bounded H ∞ -calculus of some angle, then one
1
has [X, D(A)] 1 = D(A 2 ) (see [Haa06, Theorem 6.6.9]).
2
Stochastic maximal regularity can equivalently be formulated using the
stochastic integral operators of Definition 3.2. In this case the kernel is given
by
K(t, s) := S(t, s) 10≤s<t ∈ L(X, Y ).
Here we implicitly assume that S(t, s) maps X into Y . Below we will apply
the extrapolation theory of Section 5 to study independence of p and the
weight for Definition 8.1.

8.3. Semigroup case. We first turn to the time independent case.
Theorem 8.2 (Extrapolation in the semigroups case). Suppose X is a UMD
Banach space with type 2. Let A be sectorial of angle < π/2. Take r ∈ [2, ∞)
and assume that Y is one of the following spaces
(8.3)

D(A1/2 ),

Ḋ(A1/2 ),

[X, D(A)] 1 ,

or

Suppose A ∈
)) for some p ∈ [2, ∞). Then for all q ∈ (2, ∞) and
w ∈ Aq/2 one has A ∈ SMR(Lq (w; Y )). In particular, the mild solution u
to (8.1) satisfies
1
max{ 21 , q−2
}

kukLq (Ω×R+ ,w;Y ) ≤ C [w]Aq/2

kGkLq (Ω×R+ ,w;γ(H,X)) ,

where C only depends on X, A, p, q.
Proof. The space Y has type 2 with τ2,Y ≤ τ2,X , which is trivial for D(A1/2 )
and Ḋ(A1/2 ), follows from [HNVW17, Proposition 7.1.3] for [X, D(A)] 1 and
2
follows from [Cob83, Corollary 1] for (X, D(A)) 1 ,r .
2

In all cases except for Ḋ(A1/2 ) it follows from the proof of [AV20, Proposition 4.8] that A is invertible. We claim that in all cases

Indeed, this standard interpolation estimate follows from [Lun95, Corollary
1.2.7 and Proposition 2.2.15], [Tri78, Theorem 1.10.3] and [Haa06, Proposition 6.6.4]. Since tkAe−tA kL(X,Y ) ≤ M for t ≥ 0 and some M > 0 (see
[EN00, Theorem II.4.6]), the above interpolation estimates implies that

obtain that K ∈ Kγ (L (R+ )). Next we will check the conditions of Theorem
6.3 for the homogenous space R+ (see Section 7).
Let k(t) = e−tA . By the analyticity of the semigroup and the above
estimate, we find that for t > 0 and
3

kk′ (t)kL(X,Y ) = kAetA kL(X,Y ) ≤ C M t− 2 .
Therefore, by Lemma 4.3 we know that K is a (1, 2)-standard kernel with
kKk(1,2)−Std ≤ C M.
Now Theorem 6.3 gives that K ∈ Kγ (Lq (R+ , w)). Propositions 3.4 and 3.5
H (Lq (R , w)) with the claimed estimate.
then imply that K ∈ KW

Remark 8.3.
(i) Combining Theorem 8.2 with [AV20, Section 5], similar results as in
Theorem 8.2 hold on finite time intervals (0, T ). Alternatively, this can
be deduced by applying Theorem 6.3 on (0, T ) (see also Section 7)
(ii) In general the result of Theorem 8.2 does not hold in the endpoint
q = 2. A counterexample can be found in [NVW12b, Section 6].

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

42

(iii) Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 8.2 but with
1

K(t, s) = (t − s)−θ A 2 −θ e−(t−s)A ,

it follows that for any θ ∈ (0, 12 ) the property A ∈ SMRθ (p, ∞) introduced in [AV20] is p-independent.
(iv) From the proof it is clear that Theorem 8.2 holds for any space Y ֒→ X
such that e−tA : X → Y with
1

ke−tA kL(X,Y ) ≤ Ct− 2 ,

t > 0.

Corollary 8.4. Let X be a Hilbert space and let Y be any of the spaces in
(8.3) with r = 2. Suppose that A is sectorial of angle < π/2 on X. Then
the following are equivalent:
(i) There exists a constant C > 0 such that
kt 7→ e−tA xkL2 (R+ ;Y ) ≤ C kxkX ,

x ∈ X;

(ii) For all p ∈ (2, ∞) and all w ∈ Ap/2 (and p = 2, w ≡ 1) we have
A ∈ SMR(Lp (w; Y )).
(iii) A ∈ SMR(Lp (Y )) for some p ∈ [2, ∞).
Proof. Note that Y is a Hilbert space. For (i)⇒(ii) define K(t, s) ∈ L(X, Y )
by
K(t, s) = e−(t−s)A 1s<t .
From Proposition 3.10(i) we obtain K ∈ Kγ (L2 (R+ )). Therefore K ∈
H (L2 (R )) by Propositions 3.4 and 3.5, so the result follows from Theorem
KW
+
8.2. (ii)⇒(iii) is trivial and (iii)⇒(i) follows from Proposition 3.8 combined
with Propositions 3.4 and 3.5.

Remark 8.5.
(i) Corollary 8.4(i) is equivalent to the admissability of A1/2 and is connected to the Weiss conjecture, which was solved negatively (See [JZ04],
[LM03, Theorem 5.5] and references therein).
(ii) It is well-known that there exist operators A on a Hilbert space X such
that −A generates an analytic semigroup which is exponentially stable
and
1

but

kt 7→ A 2 e−tA xkL2 (R+ ;X) ≤ CkxkX ,
1

ckxkX  kt 7→ A 2 e−tA xkL2 (R+ ;X) .

Such A can be constructed as in [LM03, Theorem 5.5] (see [AV20,
Section 5.2] for details), and does not have a bounded H ∞ -calculus.
On the other hand, Corollary 8.4 implies A ∈ SMR(Lp (w; D(A1/2 )))
for all p ∈ [2, ∞) and w ∈ Ap/2 (with w = 1 if p = 2), which shows that
having a bounded H ∞ -calculus is not necessary for stochastic maximal
regularity.
Theorem 8.6 (Real interpolation scale). Let E be a UMD Banach space
with type 2, let A be sectorial of angle < π/2 and assume 0 ∈ ρ(A). Let
θ ∈ (0, 1) and q ∈ [2, ∞). Define X = DA (θ, q) and Y = DA (θ + 12 , q). Then
for all p ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ Ap/2 , one has A ∈ SMR(Lp (w, Y )) (the case

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

43

p = 2 and w = 1 is allowed as well if q = 2). In particular, the solution u
to (8.1) satisfies

kGkLp (Ω×R+ ,w;γ(H,DA (θ,q))) ,

where the implicit constant only depends on E, A, θ, p, q.
First proof. Note that X is a UMD Banach space with type 2 by [HNVW16,
Proposition 4.2.17] and −A is the generator of an exponentially stable analytic semigroup on X with domain DA (θ+1, q) by [Lun95, Proposition 2.2.7].
Moreover, we have Y = (X, DA (θ + 1, q)) 1 ,q . It follows from [DL98] (see
2
also [BH09, Theorem 5.1]) and [AV20, Theorem 5.2] that A ∈ SMR(Lq (Y )).
Therefore, the required result follows from Theorem 8.2. The claimed norm
estimate follows since A1/2 maps DA (θ + 12 , q) isomorphically to DA (θ, q)

(see [Tri78, Theorem 1.15.2]).
Next we give a self-contained proof.
Second proof. First consider the case p = q = 2. By Propositions 3.10(i),
3.4 and 3.5 and [Tri78, Theorem 1.15.2] it suffices to show

which gives the required estimate (8.5).
From the previous case and Theorem 8.2 we obtain stochastic maximal
Lp -regularity for p ∈ [2, ∞) in the case q = 2. Thus using Propositions 3.4
and 3.5 to take H = R, the mapping

is bounded from Lp (R+ ; DA (θ, 2)) to Lp (R+ × Ω; DA (θ, 2)) for all θ ∈ (0, 1)
and p ∈ [2, ∞). By [Tri78, 1.10 and 1.18.4] one has
(Lq (R+ ; DA (θ − ε, 2)), Lq (R+ ; DA (θ + ε, 2))) 1 ,q = Lq (R+ ; DA (θ, q))
2

for ε ∈ (0, min{θ, 1− θ}) and the same holds with R+ replaced by R+ × Ω. It
follows from [Tri78, Theorem 1.3.3] that S is bounded from Lq (R+ ; DA (θ, q))
into Lq (R+ × Ω; DA (θ, q)). Applying Propositions 3.4 and 3.5 once more to
recover a general cylindrical Brownian motion WH , we obtain the stochastic
maximal regularity for p = q ∈ [2, ∞). Now another application of Theorem
8.2 gives the result for all required p, q and weights w ∈ Ap/2 . The claimed

norm estimate again follows since A1/2 maps DA (θ + 12 , q) isomorphically to
DA (θ, q) (see [Tri78, Theorem 1.15.2]).

Remark 8.7.
(i) By carefully checking the proofs of Theorems 8.2 and 8.6 (and in particular Proposition 3.4) one sees that Theorem 8.6 actually holds for all
martingale type 2 spaces E. As mentioned in Remark 8.3(i), Theorem
8.6 holds on finite time intervals as well and in this case we only need
that A + λ is sectorial of angle < π/2 for some λ ∈ R.
(ii) Theorem 8.6 extends [BH09, Theorem 5.1] and [DL98] to the case
where p 6= q and to the weighted setting. Note that even for w = 1 one
cannot obtain Theorem 8.6 from the case p = q and a real interpolation
argument. Indeed, in general for an interpolation couple (X0 , X1 ) one
has (see [Cwi74])
(Lp0 (Ω × R+ ; X0 ), Lp1 (S; X1 ))θ,q 6= Lpθ (Ω × R+ ; (X0 , X1 )θ,q ),
θ
with p1θ = 1−θ
p0 + p1 . The equality does hold if q = pθ .
(iii) The assumption 0 ∈ ρ(A) in Theorem 8.6 is needed in general. Indeed,
there exists a bounded sectorial operator A on a Hilbert space E such
that (8.5) does not hold (see [HNVW16, Corollary 10.2.29 and Theorem
10.4.21]). Since in this case DA (θ, p) = E for all θ ∈ (0, 2) and p ∈
[1, ∞], Propositions 3.4, 3.5 and 3.8 imply that (8.4) cannot hold.

We end this subsection with another result for real interpolation spaces.
It extends [Brz95, (4.10)] to the case p ∈ (2, ∞) and to the setting of infinite
time intervals.
Theorem 8.8. Let E be a UMD Banach space with type 2 and let A be
sectorial of angle < π/2 on E. Let X = DA ( 12 , 2) and Y = Ḋ(A). Then for
all p ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ Ap/2 , one has A ∈ SMR(Lp (w, Y )) (the case p = 2
and w = 1 is allowed as well). In particular, the solution u to (8.1) satisfies
1
max{ 21 , p−2
}

kAukLp (Ω×R+ ,w;E) ≤ C [w]Ap/2

kGkLp (Ω×R+ ,w;γ(H,DA ( 1 ,2))) ,
2

where C only depends on E, A, p.
Proof. Note that as in the first proof of Theorem 8.6, A is sectorial of angle
< π/2 on the space X. For p = 2, as in the second proof of Theorem 8.6, it
suffices to prove the following variant of (8.5)

kAe−tA xk2E dt ≤ CkxkDA ( 1 ,2) .

The latter estimate is immediate from the definition of DA ( 21 , 2). It remains

8.4. Stochastic heat equation on Rd . Next we continue with the stochastic heat equation. We will show that using only extrapolation results for
stochastic singular integrals one can deduce the stochastic maximal Lp (Lq )regularity results in [Kry00] and [NVW12b]. Moreover we actually obtain
results with weights in time. One can check that the proof of [NVW12b]
based on the boundedness H ∞ -calculus of −∆ actually also gives the result
with weights in time, and moreover Aq -weights in spaces could be added
as well. Still we find it illustrative to show in the example below that the
L2 (L2 )-case can be combined with extrapolation arguments to deduce the
weighted Lp (Lq )-case for all p ∈ (2, ∞) and q ∈ [2, ∞). For details on Bessel
potential spaces we refer to [Tri78].
Example 8.9 (Stochastic heat equation in Bessel-potential spaces). Let m ∈
N, s ∈ R, p, q ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ Ap/2 (or p = q = 2, w ≡ 1). On Rd consider
(
du + (−∆)m u dt = G dWH , on R+ ,
(8.6)
u(0) = 0,
where G ∈ LpF (Ω × R+ , w; H s,q (Rd ; H)). Then the mild solution u to (8.6)
satisfies

kGkLp (Ω×R+ ,w;H s,q (Rd ;H)) ,

where C only depends on p, q, d.
Proof. By lifting we may assume s = 0 (see [Tri78, Theorems 2.3.2-2.3.4]).
First suppose q = 2. It suffices to check Corollary 8.4(i). Note for any
f ∈ L2 (Rd ) by Plancherel’s theorem

Therefore by Corollary 8.4 we find the desired result for q = 2.
From the extrapolation theorem [KK16, Theorem 5.2 and Example 5.4] we
obtain the result for w = 1 and p = q ∈ (2, ∞). An application of Theorem
8.2 gives the required estimate for all p, q ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ Ap/2 .

Next we prove a similar result on Besov spaces. For details on Besov
space we refer to [Tri78].

Example 8.10 (Stochastic heat equation in Besov spaces). Let m ∈ N, r ∈
[2, ∞), s ∈ R, p, q ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ Ap/2 (or p = q = 2, w ≡ 1). On Rd
consider

kGkLp (Ω×R+ ,w;Br,q

where C only depends on p, q, r, s, d.
Proof. Again by lifting (see [Tri78, Theorem 2.3.4]) we may assume s :=
2mθ ∈ (0, 2m). Let E = Lr (Rd ) and define
(A, D(A)) := ((1 − ∆)m , W 2m,r (Rd )).

s
Then A is sectorial of angle 0 and 0 ∈ ρ(A) on E. Since DA (θ, q) = Br,q

(see [Tri78, Remark 2.4.2.4]) the result follows from Theorem 8.6.

Remark 8.11.
(i) There is an inconsistency between the equations (8.6) and (8.7) (−∆
vs. 1 − ∆). The reason to consider 1 − ∆ is that one has the restriction
0 ∈ ρ(A) in Theorem 8.6. With a different proof one can also consider
Example 8.10 with 1 − ∆ replaced by −∆. For example one can obtain
this by a real interpolation argument in Example 8.9. To avoid adaptedness problems in the interpolation argument one can first consider
deterministic G and afterwards apply Proposition 3.4.
(ii) The results of Examples 8.9 and 8.10 are incomparable except if r =
q = 2 (see [Tri83, Theorem 2.3.9]). A similar example could be proved
for Triebel–Lizorkin spaces, by using [NVW12b] and the boundedness
s (Rd ), which can be proved as in
of the H ∞ -calculus of 1 − ∆ on Fr,q
[HNVW17] with the Mihlin multiplier theorem [Tri83, Theorem 2.3.7].
We do not see a way to prove this using just extrapolation.
8.5. Stochastic heat equation on a wedge. Our next application is an
Lp (Lq )-version of the stochastic maximal regularity result in [CKLL18] for
the stochastic heat equation on an angular domain. The deterministic setting was considered in [Sol01, Theorem 1.1] and later improved in [Naz01,
Theorem 1.1] and [PS07, Corollary 5.2]. At the moment it is unclear whether
the Dirichlet Laplacian −∆ on an angular domain has a bounded H ∞ calculus, and how to characterize D((−∆)1/2 ) in terms of weighted Sobolev
spaces. Therefore, we can not apply [NVW12b] and instead we will use
[CKLL18] and extrapolation theory to derive Lp (Lq )-regularity results.
Example 8.12. Let κ ∈ (0, 2π). On the wedge

D := {x ∈ R2 : x = (r cos(ϕ), r sin(ϕ)), r > 0, ϕ ∈ (0, κ)}

consider the stochastic heat equation:
(
du − ∆u dt = G dWH , on R+ ,
(8.8)
u(0) = 0.
Let q ∈ [2, ∞) and assume θ is such that

Then for all p ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ Ap/2 (where p = 2 and w = 1 if q = 2 is
allowed as well) the mild solution u to (8.8) satisfies
(8.10)

kukLp (Ω×R+ ,w;Ẇ 1,q (D,|·|θ−2 )) ≤ CkGkLp (Ω×R+ ,w;Lq (D,|·|θ−2 ;H))

kukLp (Ω×R+ ,w;Lq (D,|·|θ−2−q )) ≤ CkGkLp (Ω×R+ ,w;Lq (D,|·|θ−2 ;H)) ,

where C only depends on d, p, q, [w]Ap/2 , θ and κ. Here Ẇ 1,q (D, |·|θ−2 ) denotes the usual homogenous Sobolev space of distributions u such that
∂j u ∈ Lq (D, |·|θ−2 ).
Proof. In [CKLL18] (8.10) was proved for p = q and w = 1, where it was
stated for bounded intervals (0, T ). Since it holds with T -independent constants one can let T → ∞ to find the result on R+ . In order to prove the
result for p 6= q we will use Theorem 8.2 with
X := Lq (D, |·|θ−2 ))

Y := Ẇ 1,q (D, |·|θ−2 ) ∩ Lq (D, |·|θ−2−q ).

By Proposition A.2 −∆ is sectorial of angle < π/2 and ket∆ kL(X,Y ) ≤ Ct−1/2
for t > 0, so that Y is allowed in Theorem 8.2 (see Remark 8.3(iv)), and
hence the result follows.

8.6. Non-autonomous case with time-dependent domains. In this
subsection we prove extrapolation results under the conditions introduced
by Acquistapace and Terreni [AT87] (see also [Acq88, AT92, Ama95, Sch04,
Tan97] and references therein). In the deterministic case extrapolation of
maximal Lp -regularity was proved in [CF14, CK18] under the Acquistapace–
Terreni conditions and the Kato–Tanabe condition. Here the authors consider maximal Lp -regularity on R and R+ respectively. Below we prefer to
consider maximal regularity results on finite intervals (0, T ) in order to avoid
exponential stability assumptions. This is possible due to Section 7 and a
version of this theory could also be applied in the deterministic setting.
Fix T ∈ (0, ∞). Next we introduce the (AT)-conditions due to Acquistapace and Terreni on a family of closed operators (A(t))t∈[0,T ] on a
Banach space X. Let us write Aw (t) = A(t) + w. We start with a uniform
sectoriality condition:
(AT1) There exists a ϑ ∈ (0, π/2), w ≥ 0 and M > 0 such that for every
t ∈ [0, T ], one has σ(Aw (t)) ⊆ Σϑ and
kR(λ, Aw (t))kL(X) ≤
where

M
, λ ∈ Σcϑ ,
|λ| + 1


Σϑ := λ ∈ C \ {0} : |arg λ| < ϑ .

The next condition is a Hölder continuity assumption, which depends on the
change of the domains D(A(t)).
(AT2) There exist 0 < µ, ν ≤ 1 with µ + ν > 1 and M ≥ 0 such that for
all s, t ∈ [0, ∞) and λ ∈ Σcϑ ,
|λ|ν Aw (t)R(λ, Aw (t))(Aw (t)−1 − Aw (s)−1 )

L(X)

≤ M |t − s|µ .

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

48

When (A(t))t∈[0,T ] satisfies both (AT1) and (AT2) we say that it satisfies
(AT).
If the domains D(A(t)) all equal a fixed Banach space X1 and
kA(t) − A(s)kL(X1 ,X) ≤ C |t − s|µ
for some µ > 0, then (A(t))t∈[0,T ] satisfies (AT2) with ν = 1. Indeed, this
follows directly from the equation Aw (t)−1 − Aw (s)−1 = Aw (t)−1 (Aw (s) −
Aw (t))Aw (s)−1 .
The following generation result is due to Acquistapace and Terreni (see
[Acq88, AT92, Sch04] for details). We denote D := {(t, s) ∈ [0, T ] × [0, T ] :
t ≥ s}.
Proposition 8.13 (Evolution family). Assume (AT) for (A(t))t∈[0,T ] . There
exists a unique strongly continuous map S : D → L(X) such that
S(t, t) = I,

t ∈ [0, T ],

S(t, s)S(s, r) = S(t, r),
d
dt S(t, s)

t ≥ s ≥ r,

t > s.

Moreover for all 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 there exists a constant C > 0 such that
kAw (t)α S(t, s)kL(X) ≤ C (t − s)−α ,

(t, s) ∈ D.

Given S as in Proposition 8.13, we call (S(t, s))t≥s the evolution family
generated by (A(t))t∈[0,T ] . In order to state our extrapolation result we will
need some notation. For 0 < α ≤ 1 and t ∈ R define
Xαt := D(Aw (t)α ).

endowed with the graph norm. Moreover set X0t = D(Aw (t))
since −w ∈ ρ(A(t)) we have

x ∈ D(Aw (t)α ).

Proof. The result for β = α is clear from the assumption and [Sch04, (2.19)].
For β = 0, the result follows from [Sch04, (2.16)]. The result for 0 < α < β
follows by interpolation.

We can now prove our extrapolation theorem for (A(t))t∈[0,T ] in the setting
of Acquistapace and Terreni:

K(t, s) = S(t, s) 1t>s .

Then by our assumptions, Propositions 8.13, 3.4 and 3.5 we know that
K ∈ Kγ (Lp (0, T )). Therefore by Theorem 6.3 it suffices to check the (ǫ, 2)standard kernel conditions for K.
To do so take t > s and note that by Proposition 8.13 for 0 ≤ s < t ≤ T ,
1

kK(t, s)kL(X,Y ) ≤ C kA(t) 2 S(t, s)kL(X) ≤ C(t − s)−1/2 .

To check (4.3) on [0, T ] let α ∈ ( 12 , 1] be such that the conclusion of
Lemma 8.14 holds and take |t − t′ | ≤ 12 |t − s|. If t < s, then also t′ < s and
there is nothing to prove. Thus it suffices to consider the case t, t′ > s. If
t′ > t, then
kK(t′ , s) − K(t, s)kL(X,Y ) = kK(t′ , t) − IkL(Xαt ,Y ) kK(t, s)kL(X,Xαt )

same estimate holds with t and t′ interchanged. Since t′ − s ≥ 12 (t − s), (4.3)
also follows in this case.
Next we check (4.4). By [AT92, Theorem 6.4] we have for 0 ≤ s < t ≤ T
that
=C

kS(t, s)A(s)kL(X) ≤ C(t − s)−1 .

As in the proof of Lemma 4.3 we obtain that (4.4) holds with ω(r) = Cr.
We can therefore conclude that K is an (α − 12 , 2)-standard kernel, which
finishes the proof.

As an application we deduce stochastic maximal Lp -regularity for an operator family which was previously considered in [Acq88, Sch04, Yag91] in
the deterministic setting and in [SV03] and [Ver10, Example 8.2] in the
stochastic setting. In particular, stochastic maximal L2 (L2 )-regularity was
derived in the latter. Below we extend this to an Lp (Lq )-setting.
Example 8.17 (Stochastic heat equation on domains with time-dependent
Neumann boundary condition). Let ǫ ∈ (0, 21 ) and T ∈ (0, ∞). On a
bounded C 3+ǫ -domain D ⊆ Rd consider

Here the differential operator A and boundary operator are given by

∂i aij (t, x)∂j u,

where for x ∈ ∂D, n(x) ∈ Rd denotes the outer normal of D. Assume that
the coefficient are real-valued and satisfy
ǫ

aij ∈ C 1+ 2 ,2+ǫ ([0, T ] × D),

for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , d}.
We further assume (aij ) is symmetric and that there exists a κ > 0 such
that
n
X
aij (t, x)ξi ξj ≥ κ|ξ|2 , x ∈ D, t ∈ [0, T ], ξ ∈ Rd .
i,j=1

Then for all p, q ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ Ap/2 (where p = q = 2 and w = 1 is
allowed as well) the mild solution u to (8.13) satisfies
kukLp (Ω×(0,T ),w;W 1,q (D)) ≤ CkGkLp (Ω×(0,T ),w;Lq (Rd ;H)) ,

where C does not depend on G.

Remark 8.18. Example 8.17 for p = q = 2 and w ≡ 1 has been shown in
[Ver10, Example 8.2] assuming only a C 2 domain and
aij ∈ C 1/2+ǫ ([0, T ]; C(D)),

aij (t, ·) ∈ C 1 (D),

∂k aij ∈ C([0, T ] × D)

for all i, j, k ∈ {1, . . . , d} and t ∈ [0, T ] and some µ ∈ ( 12 , 1]. This in turn
can be extrapolated to p ∈ [2, ∞), q = 2 and w ∈ Ap/2 as in Step 2 of the
following proof. However, in this situation the kernel estimates in [EI70,
Theorem 1.1] are not strong enough to check the parabolic Hörmander condition needed in Step 1 of the following proof. Therefore only Lp (L2 ) theory
can be obtained in this setting using the kernel estimates available in literature.

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

Proof of Example 8.17. In [Ver10, Example 8.2] the result has been shown
for p = q = 2 and w ≡ 1, we will use extrapolation techniques to deduce the
general case. For this note that in [Acq88, Sch04, Yag91] it is shown that
for q ∈ (1, ∞) the realization of (A(t))t∈[0,T ] on Lq (D) with domain

D(A(t)) := u ∈ W 2,q (D) : Tr∂D (C(t, ·)u) = 0

satisfies (AT).
Step 1: We will first use [KK16, Theorem 2.5] to deduce the result for
p = q and w ≡ 1. For this let Γ denote the Green kernel of the evolution
family associated to the realization of A on L2 (D), which exists by [EI70,
Theorem 1.1]. Then the mild solution u to (8.13) is given by
Z tZ
Γ(t, s, x, y)G(s, y) dy dWH (s),
(t, x) ∈ (0, T ) × D,

For |α| = 1 define

Kα (t, s, x, y) = ∂xα Γ(t, s, x, y),

t, s ∈ (0, T ),

x, y ∈ D.

Then by [EI70, Theorem 1.1] we have for all |β| = 1, t > s and x, y ∈ D

from which the assumption, and therefore the conclusion of Lemma A.4
follows using Lemma A.3. If we extend Kα by zero for t, s ≥ T the same
conclusion holds on R+ × D, which has infinite measure. Combined with the
case p = q = 2 from [Ver10, Example 8.2] we have checked the assumptions
of [KK16, Theorem 2.5] for the operators
given by

Tα : L2 (Ω × R+ ; L2 (Rd ; H)) → L2 (Ω × R+ ; W 1,2 (D))

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

where Sαβ is the so-called resolvent associated with A, α and β. The maximal regularity result in [DL13, Theorem 3.1] gives Lp -estimates for Aθ ∂tη U in
terms of G, where β −αθ −η = 21 with θ ∈ [0, 1) and η ∈ (−1, 1). In this case
one has to estimate a stochastic convolution with kernel k(t) = Aθ ∂tη Sαβ (t).
We will not go into details on Volterra equations further now, but restrict
ourselves to checking that K(s, t) := k(s − t) is an (ǫ, 2)-standard kernel for
suitable ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ). Consequently our extrapolation theorem can be applied
to this setting as well.
First consider η ∈ (− 21 , 1). Choose ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ) such that η + ǫ ∈ (0, 1), then
there is an M > 0 such that (see [DL13, Remark 2.4])
1

k∂ ǫ k(t)k ≤ M t−ǫ− 2 .

(8.14)

Writing K(t) = ∂ −ǫ ∂ ǫ k(t), it follows from Lemma 4.4 that K is an (ǫ, 2)standard kernel.
If η ∈ (−1, − 21 ), we let ǫ = −η. Then k(t) = ∂t−ǫ Aθ Sαβ (t) and there is an
M > 0 such that since (see [DL13, Remark 2.4])
1

kAθ Sαβ (t)k ≤ M t− 2 −ǫ
Therefore, K is an (ǫ, 2)-standard kernel.
9. p-Independence of the R-boundedness of convolutions
In this final section we prove the p-independence of a Banach space property which was introduced in [NVW15a]. In order to state the condition we
need to introduce the notion R-boundedness of a family of operators.
For details on R-boundedness we refer to [HNVW17, Chapter 8]. For us
it will be enough to recall the definition. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and
let (εj )j≥1 be a Rademacher sequence on a probability sequence (Ω, A, P).
A family of operators T ⊆ L(X, Y ) is called R-bounded if there exists a
constant C such that for all T1 , . . . , Tn ∈ T and x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X one has

Let X be a Banach space with type 2. For λ ∈ C with Re(λ) > 0 let
kλ : R+ → C be given by
kλ (s) = λ1/2 e−λs ,

and define Tλ :

The following p-dependent condition was introduced in [NVW15a, NVW15b].
(Cp ) For each θ ∈ [0, π/2) the family T = {Tλ : | arg(λ)| ≤ θ} is Rbounded from Lp (R+ ; X) into Lp (R+ ; γ(R+ ; X)).

SINGULAR STOCHASTIC INTEGRAL OPERATORS

53

Note that (9.1) implies that T is uniformly bounded. In [NVW15b] the
condition (Cp ) was combined with the boundedness of the H ∞ -calculus in
order to derive stochastic maximal Lp -regularity (see Definition 8.1).
From [NVW15a, Theorems 4.7 and 7.1] it can be seen that in the following
case the condition (Cp ) holds for all p ∈ (2, ∞):
• X is a 2-convex Banach function space and the dual of its concavification X 2 is a HL-space, i.e. the lattice Hardy–Littlewood maximal
operator is bounded on Lp (Rd ; (X 2 )∗ ) for some (all) p ∈ (1, ∞).

In particular, UMD Banach function spaces are HL-spaces, but also L∞ is
an HL-space. In particular, the space Lq satisfies (Cp ) for any q ∈ [2, ∞)
and p ∈ (2, ∞). In the case q = 2 one can additionally allow p = 2. On
the other hand, Lq for q > 2 fails (C2 ) (see [NVW12b, Theorem 6.1] and
the proof of [NVW15b, Theorem 7.1]). A Banach function space with UMD
and type 2 for which we do not know whether (Cp ) holds for p ∈ (2, ∞) is
for instance ℓ2 (ℓ4 ). Some evidence against this can be found in [NVW15a,
Theorem 8.2].
It was an open problem whether (Cp ) is p-independent. Below we settle
this issue. In the special case of Banach function spaces one could also derive
this by rewriting (Cp ) as a square function result (cf. [NVW15a, Theorem
7.1]) and using operator-valued Calderón–Zygmund theory (see [GR85]).
Theorem 9.1. Let X be Banach space with type 2 and let p ∈ [2, ∞). If
(Cp ) holds, then for all θ ∈ [0, π/2), q ∈ (2, ∞) and w ∈ A q (R+ ) the family
2

T = {Tλ : | arg(λ)| ≤ θ}
is R-bounded from Lq (R+ , w; X) into Lq (R+ , w; γ(R+ ; X)). In particular
(Cq ) holds for all q ∈ (2, ∞).
Proof. Fix n ∈ N. Let λ1 , . . . , λn ∈ Σθ , f1 , . . . , fn ∈ Lq (R+ , w; γ(R+ ; X)).
Let Radn (X) be the space X n endowed with the norm
k(xj )nj=1 kRadn (X) :=

n
X

εj xj

j=1

L2 (Ω;X)

,

where (εj )nj=1 is a Rademacher sequence. Replacing the L2 (Ω; X)-norm
by Lr (Ω; X) with r ∈ [1, ∞) leads to an equivalent norm by the Kahane–
Khintchine inequalities (see [HNVW17, Theorem 6.2.4]). Define a diagonal
operator k : R+ → L(Radn (X)) by
(k(s)x)j = kλj (s)xj ,

j ∈ {1, . . . , n},

x ∈ Radn (X),

and set K(s, t) := k(s − t). To prove the required R-boundedness of T , by
the Kahane–Khintchine inequalities, Fubini’s theorem and Proposition 2.3
it suffices to prove that kKkKγ (Lq (R+ ,w)) ≤ C where C is independent of n.
Now by (Cp ) we know the latter is true for w = 1 and q = p. Therefore,
by Theorem 6.3 (see also Section 7) it suffices to check that K satisfies the
required Dini condition with constants only depending on θ. For this we
check the condition of Lemma 4.3. Moreover, since K is of convolution type
it suffices to check that kk(s)k ≤ C0 s−1/2 and kk′ (s)k ≤ C1 s−3/2 . Since k(s)

Remark 9.2. One could replace kλ by a class of functions which satisfies the

result holds on other spaces of homogenous type.

µ = πκ ∈ ( 12 , ∞). For j ∈ {0, 1, 2} let ktj : R2 → [0, ∞) be defined by

Proof. By a substitution replacing x and y by x t and y t, one can check
that it suffices to consider t = 1, and we set kj (x, y) = k1j (x, y). It suffices
to consider σ ∈ (0, 1]. Moreover, since ζ(1, x) ≤ ζ(1, x/σ) ≤ σ1 ζ(1, x), by a
substitution one can reduce to σ = 1. Let a = µ + 2 − θq . Then a > 0 by the

In the next proposition we collect some properties of the heat semigroup on
the wedge D.
Proposition A.2. Assume κ ∈ (0, 2π), q ∈ (1, ∞), θ ∈ R and set
X = Lq (D, |·|θ−2 ),

Y = Ẇ 1,q (D, |·|θ−2 ) ∩ Lq (D, |·|θ−2−q )

The following assertions hold:
(i) If − πκ < qθ < 2 + πκ , then −∆ is a sectorial operator of angle < π/2
on X. In particular, (et∆ )t≥0 is a bounded analytic semigroup on
Lq (D, |·|θ−2 );
1
(ii) If 1 − πκ < qθ < 2 + πκ , then supt>0 t 2 ket∆ kL(X,Y ) < ∞.
Although −∆ is sectorial of angle < π/2 for a large range of values of θ,
we do not know its domain on the full range. Although we do not need it
we note that if 2 − πκ < qθ < 2 + πκ , then (see [PS07, Corollary 5.2])

D(∆) = u : u, u/|·|2 , ∂ α u ∈ Lq (D, |·|θ−2 ) for |α| = 2 .
The domain for other values of θ seems more difficult to characterize.

Proof. Let µ = π/κ ∈ (1/2, ∞). For (i) by [EN00, Theorem II.4.6] it suffices
to show for all t ∈ R+ that ket∆ kL(X) ≤ M and tk∆et∆ kL(X) ≤ M for some
M > 0. We use the following estimates for Γ (see [KN14, Theorem 3.10]):

Let D ⊆ Rd be a smooth bounded domain and fix T ∈ (0, ∞]. We equip

If s < t′ < t we first consider the case that |x − y| ≤ (t − s)1/2 . Then by
(A.5) and the fundamental theorem of calculus we have
A .

(t − t′ )

(t′ − s)(d+3)/2

≤2

|(t − t′ , x − x′ )|2(2,1)
|t − s, x − y|d+3
(2,1)

,

since in this case
(A.6)

|t′ − s| ≥ |t − s| − |t − t′ | ≥ 12 |t − s|.

Next if (t−s)1/2 ≤ |x−y|, then again by (A.5) and the fundamental theorem
of calculus we have
A .

|t − t′ |

|x − y|d+3

≤

|(t − t′ , x − x′ )|2(2,1)
|t − s, x − y|d+3
(2,1)

The cases t < s < t′ and s < t < t′ are treated similarly with the roles of t
and t′ interchanged.
Now for B suppose that t′ > s. Let γ : [0, 1] → D be a smooth curve
from x to x′ such that
sup γ ′ (r) . |x − x′ |

r∈[0,1]


inf |γ(r) − y| & min |x − y|, |x′ − y| ,

r∈[0,1]

which exists since D is smooth and bounded. We first consider the case that
|x − y| ≤ |t − s|1/2 . Then by (A.4) and the fundamental theorem of calculus
we have

since (A.6) is valid in this case. Similarly if |t − s|1/2 ≤ |x − y| we have

Now we give an analog of Lemma 4.2 in the parabolic setting:
Lemma A.4. Fix T ∈ (0, ∞], let K : (0, T ) × (0, T ) × D × D → C be
measurable and take ǫ ∈ (0, 1]. Suppose there is an A0 > 0 such that

(2,1)

for all |(t − t′ , x − x′ )|(2,1) ≤ 12 |(t − s, x − y)|(2,1) . Then for all (t, x), (t′ , x′ ) ∈
(0, T ) × D we have

where

I(s) := y ∈ D : |(t − t′ , x − x′ )|(2,1) ≤ 21 |(t − s, x − y)|(2,1) .

Proof. Take (t, x), (t′ , x′ ) ∈ (0, T ) × D and define ρ = |(t − t′ , x − x′ )|(2,1) .
