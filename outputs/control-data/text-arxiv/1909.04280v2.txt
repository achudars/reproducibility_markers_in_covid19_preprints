We develop a fully self-consistent model to describe scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements of Bernalstacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and we compare the results of our model to experimental measurements. Our results
show that the STS tip acts as a top gate that changes the BLG bandstructure and Fermi level, while simultaneously
probing the voltage-dependent tunneling density of states (TDOS). These effects lead to differences between the TDOS
and the local density of states (LDOS); in particular, we show that the bandgap of the BLG appears larger than expected
in STS measurements, that an additional feature appears in the TDOS that is an artifact of the STS measurement, and
that asymmetric charge distribution effects between the individual graphene layers are observable via STS.
Bilayer graphene (BLG) has been shown to display a rich
electronic structure that is strongly dependent on both the
electrostatic environment and the relative layer orientation.
For example, transverse electric fields in Bernal-stacked BLG
can induce a continuously tunable bandgap,1 while introducing a relative twist angle between the individual graphene
sheets has been shown to promote correlated electron behavior such as superconductivity and Mott-like insulation.2–6 Furthermore, at certain temperatures and carrier densities, electrons in BLG exhibit hydrodynamic flow.7–9 These effects are,
however, often sensitive to local perturbations which can alter the nature of novel electronic states, and obfuscate them
in spatially averaged measurements; a complete understanding of BLG behavior, therefore, requires the development of
local probes that can correlate electronic structure with crystal
orientation, atomic defects, and charged impurities.
Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) provides a promising pathway for understanding the role of disorder in BLG
at atomic length scales. STS measurements of BLG on
SiO2 and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have already been
used to probe a range of properties including quasiparticle dispersion,10 gate-induced gap formation,10–12 localized
bound or scattering states,11,13 and Landau level splittings that
indicate correlated electron behavior.11 The dynamic electronic structure of BLG, however, complicates the STS data.
In particular, the BLG bandstructure is sensitive to electric
fields applied perpendicular to the sample, which can both
open a bandgap and change the carrier density.1,14–17 In STS
measurements, the perpendicular fields change as the tip voltage is varied, leading to differences between the local density
of states (LDOS) and the tunneling density of states (TDOS).
Understanding how to reconcile those differences in STS measurements is important when extracting physical BLG parameters such as bandgap, carrier density, or signatures of correlated electron behavior.

In previous STS measurements, the effect of the changing
electric field from the tip has been observed as instantaneous
charging events where either a localized state13 or Landau
level11 of the BLG was pushed across the Fermi level due to
tip-induced doping. In those results, and in other reports,12
the effect of tip induced changes in carrier density, and the effect of the back gate on the BLG band gap were considered.
However, a full description requires a model that includes the
tip’s effect on the transverse field as well. In this study, we
apply techniques from previously developed theoretical models of BLG in an electric field18–20 to calculate how the electronic structure of the BLG changes with tip voltage, and how
those changes affect the TDOS. We find that STS measurements of the BLG gap are expected to overestimate the width
of the bandgap, and that an extra feature is introduced in the
TDOS that is related to the BLG bandgap crossing the Fermi
energy. These calculations also show how interlayer capacitance phenomena can be observed in STS measurements, and
that – due to offsetting effects – the dependence of the charge
neutral point on back gate voltage is not significantly altered
by tip gating. We compare those calculations to experimental
STS spectra taken from a BLG/hBN device at 4.5K and find
good quantitative agreement.
A schematic of an STS measurement of BLG is shown in
Fig. 1(a). We assume the radius of curvature of the STM tip
(> 100 nm) is much larger than the tip-sample distance (. 1
nm), so that the tip can be modeled as a flat plate.21 In this
geometry, the tip acts as a top gate with voltage set to −VS
(VS is the sample bias) while a back gate voltage VB is also
applied to the doped silicon under the hBN/SiO2 layer. These
gates induce a potential V1 (V2 ) on the top (bottom) layer of
the BLG which may be combined into a symmetric and antisymmetric combination, V± = (V1 ± V2 )/2. Physically, V+
represents the local electrostatic potential of the BLG patch
under the STM tip, and V− is half of the electrostatic potential
difference between the layers. Since the sample is grounded,
the electrochemical potential is zero, Φ = εF − eV+ = 0, with
εF denoting the local Fermi level. For εF 6= 0, the sample may
be doped to a carrier density n+ = n1 + n2 , where ni is the carrier density on layer i. In general, n1 6= n2 , and we denote the

When the sample is undoped – that is, εF lies within the
bandgap – the BLG is insulating and the system can be described by two gate electrodes filled with dielectric media. If
the BLG is doped, however, the accumulated charge will establish equilibrium with the applied voltages to create an intersheet polarization field that partially offsets the applied field.

V−ext is the unscreened interlayer potential difference, and εee ff ff
is the prefactor of Eq. 4. This gives the carrier density and
bandstructure of the BLG as a function of VS , allowing us
to compute the tunneling spectra dI/dVS (see Supplementary Online Materials). The free parameters used in our selfconsistent model are the tip height d1 , the tip-sample work
function difference ∆Wt−s , and the back gate voltage offset
due to substrate-induced doping VB,0 . We note that while it is
justified to model the tip as a parallel plate in the electrostatic
equations, d1 is not necessarily equal to the true tunneling distance, since sharp protrusions may have a negligible contribution to the tip capacitance.
Figures 1(b-e) illustrate how the bandstructure of intrinsic
BLG changes with varying V(S,B) , and how those changes result in several key features in the TDOS. When the applied
voltages are zero (Fig. 1(b)), the BLG is charge neutral and
the Fermi levels of the tip and sample align. For the case when
VB > 0 (Fig. 1(c)), the BLG becomes n-doped and a bandgap
opens due to a transverse electric field from the back gate.
If a positive tip bias is also applied (−VS > 0) while keeping
the same VB > 0 (Fig. 1(d)), an opposing electric field from
the tip further dopes the BLG, and also partially closes the
bandgap by reducing the transverse electric field. Changes
in the tip voltage lead to changes in the states available for
tunneling, yielding a nonzero dI/dVS signal. We identify contributions from both the tip and sample Fermi levels – with
the latter being caused by tip-induced band bending. If the tip
Fermi level aligns with the BLG bandgap, no additional states
are available at the lowest energies, which creates a minimum
in the TDOS which we call the conventional gap (CG) feature. Meanwhile, a negative tip bias (−VS < 0, Fig. 1(e))
will both widen the bandgap and decrease the carrier density
of the BLG. In certain cases, the sample Fermi level can be
pushed into the bandgap, again reducing the number of tunnel-

ing states and creating another minimum in the TDOS which
we call the tunneling anomaly (TA).
For a fixed back gate voltage of VB = 20 V, this behavior is shown quantitatively in Fig. 2(a), where we plot the
band minima/maxima as a function of sample bias. The CG
is observed when the tip Fermi level aligns with the bandgap
of BLG, while the TA is attributed to the sample Fermi level
moving through the bandgap due to tip gating. We note that
the underlying cause of the TA is similar to the mechanism of
negative differential resistance (NDR) in other spectroscopic
studies of atoms and molecules on insulating or semiconducting surfaces, as well as 2D materials.23–33 In those studies,
the tip-induced band bending pushes the Fermi level through
a molecular resonance, leading to charge-induced changes in
the conductivity, while in this work the band bending pushes
the BLG into an insulating state underneath the STM tip.
The gate-dependent dI/dVS spectra calculated using our
full self-consistent model are shown in Fig. 2(b-d) for different choices of tip height and work function, and geometri-

cal parameters consistent with a typical hBN/SiO2 substrate.
These results show that when fully accounting for the capacitive effects of the tip, the spectra exhibit several key features.
First, the TA appears in the spectrum as a local minimum that
disperses with VB having slope opposite to the CG. The TA is
visible for small tip-sample distances (Fig. 2(b,c)), but disappears when the tip is far from the sample (Fig. 2(d)), demonstrating that this feature is due to the electrostatic influence of
the tip. Second, the CG appears as a narrow dip that occurs
between two sharp peaks that are due to the van Hove singularities (vHs) at the conduction and valence band edges of the
BLG (inset Fig. 2(b)). Our calculation shows asymmetry in
the vHs peaks due to the broken layer symmetry in the presence of an electric field as well as preferential tunneling into
the top layer of the BLG.19 These predictions are consistent
with previous STS measurements of Bernal stacked BLG,11
as well as recent measurements performed on twisted bilayer
samples.5,6,34,35 Third, as shown in Fig. 2(e), the apparent energy width of the CG is tip height dependent, such that for VB

= 50 V, it appears as a 65, 55, and 51 meV gap for tip heights
of 0.5, 1, and 2 nm, respectively. Fourth, there is an asymmetric increase in the dI/dVS signal on either side of the TA
due to vHs on the band edge. As described above, this effect
is stronger on one side due to the asymmetric occupation of
charge on the layers, a phenomenon related to near-layer capacitance enhancement (NLCE), which has previously been
observed in transport measurements.14,20
To compare our predictions to experimental measurements,
we took STS measurements on exfoliated BLG samples at
4.5K and at < 10−11 mbar. Six separate experiments were
performed on four BLG/hBN samples and two BLG/SiO2
samples, all of which showed results consistent with the data
shown here, with some variation attributed to microscopic
changes in the STM tip and charge puddles in the SiO2 (see
Supplementary Online Materials). The thickness of the hBN
layers in all devices were optically estimated to be around 100
nm (on 285 nm SiO2 ) through comparison with samples measured by atomic force microscopy. Measurements were carried out with chemically etched STM tips made of Pt/Ir alloy. The differential conductance signal was obtained using a
lock-in amplifier with a modulation amplitude of 0.25-7 mV
and frequency of 200-700 Hz. Before taking data on the BLG,
the spectroscopic integrity of the STM tip was verified by acquiring dI/dVS spectra on an Au(111) surface.36
Figure 3(a) shows a topographic image of the BLG surface.
Point spectroscopy measurements using the same STM tip are
given in Fig. 3(b) for a few gate voltages, alongside simulated spectra calculated with our self-consistent model for
d1 = 5.5 nm, Wt = 4.45 eV, and VB,0 = −12 V. The calculated spectra also include the effects of the known inelastic
tunneling channel due to a phonon mode with energy Eph = 63
meV (see Supplementary Online Materials).37 For gate voltages −50 ≤ VB ≤ 50 V, the experimentally measured and calculated dI/dVS spectra are shown side-by-side in Fig. 3(d,e).
These results show strong quantitative agreement. We observe
a narrow CG within the elastic signal (the central dark blue
region where |VS | < Eph ) and a broadened inelastic CG signal that is shifted in energy by the phonon. Furthermore, we
identify the TA as a narrow feature that has a strong dependence on the applied gate voltage and the NLCE asymmetry
predicted in the model. A highly resolved spectroscopic measurement of the elastic CG is shown in Fig. 3(c) for two different tunneling setpoints of 5 nA and 200 pA, representing a tip

height change of 1.5 Å. These data show two peaks of differing heights which we attribute to the vHs on the band edges.
We measure a decrease in the peak spacing of 1±1 meV as the
tip retracts, which is consistent with Fig. 2(e), where we show
that increases in tip height should decrease the bandgap. For
a change in tip height of only 1.5 Å, the change in observed
bandgap is expected to be small for large (>2 nm) electrostatic
distances, and is thus at the edge of our detection limit.
Unlike the CG, the energetic position of the TA is not
shifted by inelastic tunneling, which is consistent with the
predicted spectra. Within our model and fitting procedure, the
CG and TA slopes are able to be simultaneously matched with
the data, however, the theory predicts a more pronounced,
gap-like TA. This discrepancy may be experimental in nature, due to thermal broadening in our 4.5 K STM, and broadening due to the lock-in modulation voltage. Another possibility is the breakdown of Eq. 2 near the TA, where the
sample approaches charge-neutrality and one can no longer
safely assume kB T  εF . Measurements of the TA obtained
with smaller modulation voltages and different tip heights are
shown in Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Online Materials.
We plot in Fig. 4 the CG and TA positions as a function
of applied gate voltage, as well as the CG width. The CG
position (ED ) and width (∆g ) were obtained by fitting points
around the minimum in each spectrum to a piece-wise fit (see
Supplementary Online Materials). The TA, meanwhile, appears as a discontinuity in our sample bias-dependent line
cuts, and its position (ETA ) was determined based on the location of this discontinuity. These experimentally extracted
parameters are compared to theoretical values from the results
of Fig. 3(e). Interestingly, the experimentally measured CG
width ∆g never drops to zero, hovering around 10-25 meV.
This result is in disagreement with our model – which predicts the CG gap to close regardless of the fitting parameters – but is consistent with previous STS measurements of
BLG.10,11 This discrepancy offers evidence for the appearance of gapped broken symmetry states when the applied electric field approaches zero, which are predicted to have an energy gap ranging from a few meV up to 30 meV.38–40 However, it is also possible that this gap is caused by substrate
interactions. In particular, the underlying hBN may apply a
periodic potential to the BLG, which can create a persistent
bandgap.41–43 Finally, we note that our model uses a flat-plate
capacitor model for the STM tip, while in reality it has some

5
finite curvature which can create a localized potential well that
confines the quasiparticles in the BLG such that a quantum dot
is formed underneath the tip.13,44 This quantization effect can
also create persistent energy gaps in the STS spectrum.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a fully selfconsistent electrostatic model for STS measurements of BLG
is required to replicate many features of the dI/dVS spectrum.
In particular, we show that the STM tip can act as a top gate
which simultaneously modifies the carrier density and bandstructure of BLG. These effects are observable as a tunneling anomaly in the spectrum that has a gate-dependent slope
that is opposite to that of the conventional band gap in BLG,
and an overestimation of the BLG bandgap in TDOS measurements. Furthermore, the spectrum contains features related to
the unique capacitative behavior of BLG, which can be understood through our electrostatic model. More generally, this
work demonstrates the importance of considering tip-gating
effects in STS experiments of 2D materials that are known to
have electronic properties that depend on an applied perpendicular electric field, including twisted bilayer graphene45,46
and some transition metal dichalcogenides.47–49 These results
show that electrostatic models that include the effect of the
varying tip voltage are necessary to relate the dI/dVS spectrum to the electronic structure of such materials.
