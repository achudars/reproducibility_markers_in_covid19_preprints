Odd-frequency superconductivity is an exotic phase of matter in which Cooper pairing between
electrons is entirely dynamical in nature. Majorana zero modes exhibit pure odd-frequency superconducting correlations due to their specific properties. Thus, by tunnel-coupling an array of
Majorana zero modes to a spin-polarized wire, it is in principle possible to engineer a bulk onedimensional odd-frequency spinless s-wave superconductor. We here point out that each tunnel
coupling element, being dependent on a large number of material-specific parameters, is generically
complex with sample variability in both its magnitude and phase. Using this, we demonstrate that,
upon averaging over phase-disorder, the induced superconducting, including odd-frequency, correlations in the spin-polarized wire are significantly suppressed. We perform both a rigorous analytical
evaluation of the disorder-averaged T -matrix in the wire, as well as numerical calculations based
on a tight-binding model, and find that the anomalous, i.e. superconducting, part of the T -matrix
is highly suppressed with phase disorder. We also demonstrate that this suppression is concurrent
with the filling of the single-particle excitation gap by smearing the near-zero frequency peaks, due
to formation of bound states that satisfy phase-matching conditions between spatially separated
Majorana zero modes. Our results convey important constraints on the parameter control needed
in practical realizations of Majorana zero mode structures and suggest that the achievement of a
bulk 1D odd-ω superconductivity from MZMs demand full control of the system parameters.

INTRODUCTION

As was originally demonstrated by Berezinskii,1 the
superconducting pair amplitude of fermions may also
be odd under exchange of time coordinates, or, equivalently, frequency ω, which extends the usual classification of superconducting (SC) pair symmetries at
equal times.2,3 Part of the importance of odd-frequency
(odd-ω) pairing is based on it allowing for highly unconventional SC dynamical correlations, even suggested
to be an instance of hidden order.4 Examples of oddfrequency pairing include long-range proximity effect in
superconductor-ferromagnet junctions,5,6 paramagnetic
Meissner effect,7,8 and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in
topological SCs.9,10
MZMs are their own antiparticles and emerge isolated as end states in certain topological SCs.11 They
currently hold particular relevance for potential applications in topological quantum computation.11–14 Remarkably, MZMs are also a clear example of states that
carry pure odd-ω spin-polarized correlations. This is due
to their intrinsic nature of being their own antiparticles that implies that their particle-hole propagator is
at the same time a particle-particle propagator, which
for a zero-energy state automatically acquire an odd-ω
dependence.9,10,15,16
A promising experimentally feasible platform for topological SC, and therefore for MZMs, is based on combining nanowires (NWs) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling,
a strong magnetic field, and proximity induced s-wave
SC.17–20 Other proposals for MZMs include magnetic
atoms on spin-orbit coupled SCs,21,22 and proximitycoupled SC on metallic edge states of topological insula-

tors.23,24 These physical realizations have motivated an
enormous interest since the initial experiments.25–29
Due to the vast experimental progress on MZMs, a
promising direction to realize odd-ω SC is using MZMs.
In fact, it was recently proposed how to engineer a
bulk one-dimensional (1D) odd-ω spinless s-wave SC by
coupling an array of MZMs to a spin-polarized wire
(SPW).30 The setup was also shown to exhibit a paramagnetic Meissner effect, whereby an applied magnetic flux
is enhanced rather than screened by the induced supercurrent. Additionally, the induced pure odd-ω SC state
was demonstrated to be robust against disorder in the
coupling coefficients, which, nonetheless, were assumed
to be real. However, under more realistic conditions any
couplings to MZMs can easily become complex.31–34 In
fact, in an array of MZMs, it is very unlikely to have equal
or even real valued couplings due to the large amount of
parameters possible to tune in topological SC wires.25–29
This then implies that it is crucial to analyze the robustness of the induced odd-ω pairing also under complex
and different couplings, and in particular disorder with
respect to the complex phase of the coupling terms.
In this work, we consider an array of MZMs coupled to
a SPW through generalized complex couplings. In particular, we focus on the role of disorder in the phases
of the complex couplings. We find that, apart from local odd-ω pairing, there generically also exist non-local
odd- and even-ω correlations. All these amplitudes correspond to the equal-spin triplet (spin-polarized) symmetry
as they arise as an induced effect due to MZMs. Most
importantly, based on both analytical and numerical approaches, we demonstrate that even moderate phase disorder in the couplings drastically suppresses the induced

SC in the SPW, in stark contrast to the effect of real
disorder where even large variations of the couplings has
been shown to only produce very small changes.30 Furthermore, we show that the suppression of the induced
pair correlations is accompanied by the filling of the energy gap in the density of states (DOS) due to formation of bound states in the SPW. As a consequence, our
work shows that experimental realizations of a 1D odd-ω
superconductor from an array of MZMs must have full
control of the phases of the couplings.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In
Sec. II we present the model, introduce the distribution
of complex couplings, and discuss the Green’s function
approach for the pair correlations as well as a numerical
tight-binding setup. In Sec. III we analytically calculate
the pair amplitudes for one and two MZMs coupled to
the SPW, and also perform a perturbative analysis for
an array of MZMs. Complementary to this, in Sec. IV
we carry out a tight-binding numerical study in order to
support our analytical findings. Finally, we summarize
our work in Sec. V. For completeness, we also provide
additional supporting details in four Appendices.

II.

MODEL AND METHOD

To create a 1D odd-ω superconductor we consider an
SPW that is tunnel coupled to an array of MZMs. The
MZMs are modeled as end modes of semiconducting NWs
that are in a topologically non-trivial state, similar to
Ref. 31. Each NW carries one MZMs at each of its two
ends, but only one of them is coupled to the SPW, as
illustrated in Fig. 1. The Hamiltonian H of the whole
system is therefore composed of three parts H = Hw +
HΓ + Hδ , where
Z
Hw =

ˆ cx ,
dx c†x ξ(x)

(1)

where Γn represents the coupling strength between the
MZM γn and the fermionic mode in the SPW cx at position xn = n b, where b is the separation between two
neighboring MZMs. The MZM γn = fn + fn† = γn† is one
of the two MZM formed from a zero-energy Bogoliubov
excitation fn† of the topological NW. For topological NWs
of finite length the two MZMs split from zero-energy due
to hybridization,35–38 which is commonly described by:11
Hδ =


1X  †
δn fn fn − fn fn† ,
2 n

(3)

where δn is the energy splitting in the n-th NW.39
We consider a general situation in which the coupling strengths Γn are allowed to be all different from
each other and also complex quantities, which describe
a realistic situation for an array of MZMs coupled to a
SPW.31–33 Here, the SC phases in the topological NWs
can easily be one of the sources for the complex Γ.
Moreover, under realistic conditions, complex couplings
Γ might also appear just due to different parameters in
the topological NWs. For example, recent studies in systems with spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, have
demonstrated that the coupling between a MZM and
normal systems (quantum dots) gives rise to a tunneling element that is both spin-dependent and complex.34
Thus, since the couplings depend on the parameters of
each NW and it is very hard to the imagine the NWs
in an array all having exactly the same parameters, the
couplings will generically be complex and vary randomly.
We are therefore interested in analyzing the robustness
of the induced SC correlations into the SPW against disorder in the couplings, and particularly phase disorder,
not previously considered. For real and equal Γn , Eq. (2)
reduces to the model used in Ref. 30, where real disorder
was also studied.
More specifically, we model the complex couplings
Γn = |Γn | ei θn as random variables with the logarithm of
the magnitude ln(|Γn |/Γ0 ) being uniformly distributed
and the scaled phase θn /π being independently distributed according to a weighted uniform distribution
around 0 with weight (1 + s)/2 and around 1 and −1
with weight (1 − s)/4, with in total the width Dφ of the
2π phase interval covered. We thus characterize phase
disorder by Dφ , where Dφ = 1 means full phase disorder.
Physically, a finite value of Dφ indicates the lack of control over the phases in the complex couplings, an issue

3
impossible to avoid experimentally. We also introduce a
sign bias, i.e. weight of positive values minus weight of
negative values, equal to s, −1 ≤ s ≤ 1. There is nothing
fundamental in this choice of distribution, and, in fact,
other distributions that model phase disorder would produce similar conclusions. However, this choice has the adq
vantage of allowing the moments h |Γ|2 − h|Γ|2 i i, and
q
hΓ i to be expressed analytically, exhibiting also a high
suppression with increase in the power q and width of
the phase distribution Dφ . In particular, the expectation value:

Dyson’s equation for the SPW

The focus of this work is on the pair correlations induced in the SPW, and thus it is convenient to work with
a Nambu-Gor’kov Green’s function in imaginary time:
Ĝ(x, τ ; x0 , τ 0 ) = − Tτ ψ(x, τ ) ⊗ ψ̄(x0 , τ 0 ) ,

ψ̄(x0 , τ 0 ) = eτ H ψ † (x0 ) e−τ H . With only the relative
time τ − τ 0 being relevant we perform a Fourier series expansion with respect to the relative time into Matsubara
frequencies ωm = (2n + 1) π T . In this way, the Green’s
function is a 2 × 2 matrix in particle-hole space:

2 m (µw + i ωm ) and the second term to the hole propagator in the SPW gh (x − x0 ; i ωm ) = −ge (x0 − x; −i ωm ).
An equation for V̂n · Ĝ(n b, x0 ) is obtained by multiplying Eq. (7) by V̂n from the left, and setting x = n b. The
solution of this equation is then expressed as:
V̂n (i ωm ) · Ĝ(n b, x0 ; i ωm ) =
P

(10)

(6)

The equation of motion for Ĝ(x, x0 ; i ωm ) requires the
evaluation of the commutator of H = Hw +HΓ +Hδ , given
by Eqs. (1)-(3), with cx (and c†x ). When this is evaluated,
terms proportional to cx (or c†x ) and γn = fn + fn† are
obtained. Thus, the equation of motion for G contains
the correlators hhfn |c†x iiω , hhfn |cx iiω , hhfn† |c†x iiω , and
hhfn† |cx iiω . In order to eliminate these cross-correlators,
another set of commutators, of H with fn (or fn† ), is
used, which generates
terms proportional

and 2 δ(x − n b) Γn cx + Γn cx . In this way eliminating
the cross-correlators, while using the Green’s function for

T̂lm (i ωm ) = V̂n (i ωm ) δnm .

(11)

Here we introduce the shorthand notation (ĝ0 )nl (i ωm ),
which is the Green’s function for a bare SPW evaluated
at the discrete subset of positions of the MZMs, i.e.:
(ĝ0 )mn (i ωm ) = (ĝ0 )m−n (i ωm ),
(ĝ0 )n (i ωm ) = Ĝ0 (n b; i ωm ).

(12)

Finally, the solution of Eq. (7), given Eqs. (10) and
(11), may be written as:
Ĝ(x, x0 ; i ωm ) = Ĝ0 (x − x0 ; i ωm )
X

Ĝ0 (x − n b; i ωm ) ×

4
making it clear that T̂nm (i ωm ) plays the role of a T matrix for the SPW with respect to the effect of the MZM
array. The Green’s function given by Eq. (13) allows the
calculation of the induced pair correlations in the SPW
and is used for the analytical calculations in Sec. III.
B.

Numerical tight-binding setup

Beyond studying the MZM array using Green’s functions we also adopt a tight-binding version of the model
described by Eqs. (1)-(3) to facilitate numerical results going beyond the perturbative analytical treatment.
Here we place M MZMs on a ring with z − 1 lattice sites
of the SPW inbetween two MZMs and one SPW site at
each MZM site, with the periodic boundary conditions
cn+z M = cn for the SPW modes and fn+M = fn for the
Bogoliubov modes in the n-th NW through which the
MZM is expressed. The tight-binding version of Eq. (1)
is then given by:

For the clean, non-disordered system we can further impose periodic boundary conditions with period z, corresponding to a lattice constant equal to the MZM distance
b. This leads to folding of the original SPW dispersion
relation ξ(p) = −2t cos(p/z) − µ, z times as p goes over
from −z π to z π onto the new unit cell with Brillouin
zone from −π to π. Thus, specifying the band index
l (0 ≤ l ≤ z − 1) of the conduction band cut by the
chemical potential, as well as the (dimensionless) Fermi
wavevector −π < pF ≤ π, fixes the chemical potential µ

correlators are then in principle calculable. In particular, the tight-binding version of Eq. (6) is the upper left

ANALYTICAL RESULTS

In this part we demonstrate that disorder in the phases
of the complex couplings are detrimental for the induced
pair amplitudes. Moreover, we show that when there is a
finite relative phase between the couplings of at least two
MZMs, bound states are induced in the SPW. In order
to show these arguments, we consider three simple, yet
useful, cases that provide a clear visualization of the role
of complex couplings on the pair amplitudes.

5
A.

SPW coupled to a single MZM

We start by considering the simplest case, a single
MZM coupled to the SPW. In this case the system of
equations Eq. (11) is actually a single equation involving
2 × 2 matrices in Nambu space, which is readily solved:


i ωm
|Γ|2 Γ2
T̂ (i ωm ) = −

(19)

2 D (Γ∗ ) |Γ|2
2
where D = ωm
+ δ 2 + i ωm [ge (0;i ωm2)+gh (0;i ωm )] |Γ|2 is an
even function of frequency ωm . The only difference between Eq. (19) and Eq. (8) is thus the substitution of
the denominator D. This clarifies the meaning of the T matrix as involving a series of coherent events between
the MZM and the SPW of scattering as an electron and
back-scattering as a hole. Then, by using Eq. (13), the
Green’s function for the SPW is easily obtained, with the
entries specified in Eq. Eq. (6) given by:

Gee (x, x0 , i ωm ) = ge (x − x0 , i ωm )
+ ge (x, 0, i ωm ) Tee ge (0, x0 , i ωm ),
Geh (x, x0 , i ωm ) = ge (x, 0, i ωm ) Teh gh (0, x0 , i ωm ),
(20)
Ghe (x, x0 , i ωm ) = gh (x, 0, i ωm ) The ge (0, x0 , i ωm ),
Ghh (x, x0 , i ωm ) = gh (x − x0 , i ωm )
+ gh (x, 0, i ωm ) Thh gh (0, x0 , iωm ) ,
where Tij are the elements of the T̂ matrix given by
Eq. (19).
The diagonal (normal) elements of the Green’s function allow the calculation of the LDOS, while from the
off-diagonal (anomalous) terms we extract information
about the pair correlations induced in the SPW. Since
we are interested in the induced pair correlations, we now
discuss Geh which written out is:
Geh (x, x0 , i ωm ) = −

m2 Teh i sgn(ωm ) [k0 |x|−k0∗ |x0 |]
e
, (21)
|k0 |2

where we have used the expressions for the free particle propagators in the SPW given in Eq. (9), Teh =
−(i ωm /D)Γ2 , and k0 is the electron wave vector defined
after Eq. 9. The pair amplitude Geh thus exhibits translational invariance breaking through the exponent k0 |x| −
k0∗ |x0 |, which mixes electron (k0 ) and hole (k0∗ ) wavevectors with different spatial coordinates. This is similar to
the breaking of spatial parity in other superconducting
junctions.40–42 In order to visualize this point it is useful
to write the wave vector k0 , defined after Eq. (9), in the

limit |ωm |  µ, where k0 ≈ kF + i κ. Rearranging the ex0
0
ponent of Eq. (21), results in kF (|x|−|x
√ |)+i κ (|x|+|x |)
with κ = (ωm kF )/(2µ) and kF = 2m µ (we choose a
system of units in which ~ = 1). Plugging this expression into Eq. (21), leads to an exponential decay term
with decay length given by the inverse of κ and an oscillatory term governed by the Fermi wave-vector. This
oscillatory term can further be written in terms of cosines
and sines, which are even and odd-functions in space, respectively, and thus leads to the coexistence of even- and
odd-ω components of the pair amplitude.41,42 Interestingly, locally in space, i.e. x = x0 , Geh is purely odd in
frequency, an induced effect that comes directly from the
MZM. The odd-ω dependence is here captured in the element Teh , since its denominator D is an even function of
ωm . We therefore conclude that the induced local pairing
due to a single MZM is odd in frequency, in agreement
with previously reported the odd-ω nature of Majorana
pair amplitudes.9,15,30,41,43–46
Furthermore, from Eqs. (20) we observe that the
anomalous elements are proportional to Γ2 . This stems
from Eq. (19), where the diagonal elements Tee,hh are
proportional to |Γ|2 , while the off-diagonal Teh is proportional to Γ2 . This is in notable contrast to the findings
of Ref. 30, where the pair amplitude was assumed to always be proportional to real couplings. If Γ is real, it
does not present any issues for the pair amplitudes, however, it does when Γ is complex. In fact, by performing
a disorder average over the phase of Γ, the expression for
Geh might give zero or be exponentially suppressed, depending on the disorder distribution. Of course, there is
no physical meaning of performing disorder average over
the phase of Γ when only a single MZM is coupled to the
SPW. However, this simple example still clearly shows
the potentially detrimental effect of disorder averaging
over the phases of Γ on the pairing amplitudes. As we
will see in the following subsections, this seemingly innocent effect at this level has profound consequences when
considering more MZMs coupled to the SPW.

B.

SPW coupled to two MZMs

The simplest system where the relative phase of the
coupling strengths Γ has a physical manifestation is a
SPW coupled to 2 MZMs with distance b and complex
couplings Γ1,2 . Then, Eq. (11) is a 4×4 matrix in site and
Nambu spaces, but still analytically solvable. Following
the same method as for a single MZM we obtain the evenand odd-ω pair amplitudes

K(i ωm ) K̃(i ωm ), where Di (i ωm ) correspond to the
denominator of the expression in Eq. (19) but for

− i ω2m [Γ1 Γ∗2 gh (−b; i ωm ) + Γ∗1 Γ2 ge (−b; i ωm )] .
Based on these results we first conclude from Eqs. (22)
that both even- and odd-ω pair correlations are induced
in the SPW due to its coupling to MZMs. Both pair amplitudes also acquire a dependence on the phases of the
complex couplings Γ1,2 , as evident in Eqs. (23). Moreover, since these amplitudes correspond to equal-spin
spin-triplet pairing, the even-frequency component is finite non-locally but vanishes locally, which is similar to
the even-ω pairing discussed for the single MZM in the
previous subsection. On the other hand, we find that
odd-ω pairing exists both locally and non-locally. Both
even-ω and odd-ω pair amplitudes exponentially decay
from the position of the MZMs with a decay length determined by the inverse of κ, specified in the previous
subsection. Second, we conclude that the pair amplitudes given by Eqs. (22) emerge proportional to Γ21(2) or
eh
Γ1 Γ2 through the numerator of the Tij , Nij
, given by
Eqs. (23). This, therefore, implies that any average over
the complex phases of Γ1,2 leads to a suppression of the
induced pair correlations in the SPW, demonstrating a
detrimental role of complex couplings.
Before concluding this part, we explicitly demonstrate
the effect of a finite relative phase θ between the couplings
of the two MZMs Γ1,2 . This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where

(23c)
(23d)

we plot the LDOS in the SPW as a function of frequency
for nine values of the phase θ uniformly distributed on the
segment [0, 2π]. We calculate the LDOS from the standard expression LDOS(x, ω) = (−1/π)ImGee (x, x; ω +
iη), with ω real frequency, η an infinitesimal positive
number, and Gee the electron-electron Green’s function
obtained after solving Eq. (13). The system is symmetric
with respect to the midpoint x = b/2 between the two
MZMs and we therefore plot the LDOS at three representative points on the side closer to the first MZM, where

FIG. 3. LDOS (in arbitraty units) in the SPW for two MZMs
as a function of energy. Each curve is shifted vertically for
illustrative purposes and corresponds to an equidistant value
of the relative phase θ (denoted only for θ = 0, π and 2π
in panel (a) for orientation) of the coupling to two MZMs
between 0 and 2π and obtained under the first MZM (a), at
1/4 (b), and 1/2 (c) of the MZM distance b from the first
MZM. Here, coupling strength for both MZMs is Γ0 = 0.4 εF ,
b = λF , and the hybridization δ = 0.4 Γ0 for both MZMs. The
smearing factor is set to η = 0.5 × 10−4 Γ0 .

7
we measure the MZM distance b in units of the Fermi
wavelength λF = 2π/kF in the SPW.
The most prominent feature in Fig. 3 is the presence of
resonance-like peaks at ±δ, corresponding to the leaking
of the MZM states into the SPW. The weight of these
peaks is highly dependent on position, having the highest weight (anti node) at b/4, while the lowest weight
(node) is directly under the MZM and also in the middle
between the two MZMs at b/2. These correspond to delocalized states in the SPW with a half-wavelength (nodeto-node distance) b/2, i.e. a wavelength equal to b. Since
in this plot we have chosen b = λF , it is not clear from
these results which of these length scales determines the
wavelength of the bound state like feature. We therefore
investigate other MZM separations in App. B and find
that the wavelength is determined by λF . In addition,
it is clear that the spectrum is symmetric in θ relative
to θ = π. The peaks are sharpest for θ = 0, π, and 2π,
and have the largest smearing for θ = π/2, 3π/2. The
smearing, associated with a finite lifetime of these resonance states, is highly phase-dependent, which is reminiscent of the conditions for constructive and destructive
interference. To summarize, these results suggest that
delocalized bound states appear naturally systems with
multiple MZMs due to the complex couplings, but that
their behavior is also naturally expected to be less controllable as the number of Majorana NWs increases.

C.

SPW coupled to a MZM array

Having studied one and two MZM coupled to the SPW,
we finally turn to the case of an infinite array of MZMs
and for this system calculate the induced pair amplitudes
in the SPW using disorder-averaging to capture the intrinsic variability in the complex phases of the MZM couplings.
For an infinite array, it is convenient to express Eq. (11)
in terms of the Fourier series coefficients:
T̃ˆ(p, p0 ; i ωm ) =
0

T̂nm (i ωm ) e−i (p n−p m) ,

(24a)
(24b)
(24c)

where p, p0 are continuous variables on the interval
(−π, π]. The functions defined in Eqs. (24) are all periodic in each p with a period 2π. With this Eq. (11)
acquires the form:
T̃ˆ(p, p0 ; i ωm ) = Ṽˆ (p − p0 ; i ωm )

(25)

This is an integral equation for T̃ˆ(p, p0 ; i ωm ) as a function
of continuous variables, which reflects the now infinite

dimension of the matrix equation Eq. (11). Nevertheless,
it is a convenient formulation for three reasons.
First, the periodicity with a lattice constant b imposed
on the continuum wire by the MZM array is reflected in
the folded g̃ˆ0 (p; i ωm ). Expressing it in terms of the conˆ (k, i ω ), the following relatinuum Green’s function G̃

Second, the Fourier-transformed vertex coefficients
ˆ
Ṽ (p − p0 ; i ωm ) become approximately normally distributed when disorder is taken into account, regardless
of the exact distribution of the real-space V̂n (i ωm ) according to the Central Limit Theorem. This allows us
to apply Wick’s theorem for an average of a product of
several such terms in an expansion.
Third, after disorder averaging, the T -matrix recovers invariance

Eq. (24) becomes diagonal in p, p0 :
D E
D E
T̃ˆ (p, p0 ; i ωm ) = 2π δ(p − p0 ) T̃ˆ (p; i ωm ).

(28)

Using the Fourier series formulation we can now, from
Eqs. (13), (24a), (24c), and (28), express the disorderaveraged Green’s function for the SPW as:
D E
R ∞ dk ˆ

D E
× g̃ˆ0 (p; i ωm ) · T̃ˆ (p; i ωm ) · g̃ˆ0 (p; i ωm ).
(29)
Here we note that the second term incorporates the effects of BZ folding through the matrices g̃ˆ0 (p; i ωm ), with
integration over p only in the interval from −π to π.
As a direct consequence, the effects of disorder averaging are now
encompassed within the disorderD completely
E
averaged T̃ˆ -matrix. Finding a general expression for
D E
the disorder-averaged T̃ˆ -matrix is straightforward but

8
lengthy and we therefore provide the details as Appendix
C.
We are here primarily interested in the induced anomalous correlations in the SPW, characterized by the
electron-hole component of the Green’s function. To
obtain them, according to Eq. (29) and the fact that
ˆ (k; i ω ) and g̃ˆ (p; i ω ) are diagonal in Nambu

expressions for T̃ˆ within the second Born approximation (i.e. keeping only the n = 1 term in Eq. (C8), which
is of second order in δ Ṽˆ ) are provided in Appendix D, and
here we produce schematic, but, nevertheless sufficiently
detailed expressions to draw the most important conclusions. In particular, for the electron-hole component we
obtain

T̃ eh (p; i ωm ) =

where g̃e,h are given by Eqs. (27). The denominator DT is
here an even function of ωm , but its explicit form is not
necessary for our discussion. Similarly, the exact form
of φ1 (i ωm ), given by Eq. (D2b), and ĝ1 (i ωm ), given by
Eqs. (C4b), (D3), is not important for our discussion.
Although the expression for the disorder-averaged pair
amplitude Geh that follows from combining Eqs. (29)
and (30) is not simple, some conclusions can
D be Edrawn
already from analyzing the components of

T̃ eh . For

example, we obtain that A2 = |Γ|4 , B2 = |Γ|2 Γ2 ,
and C2 = Γ4 , while A1 = |Γ|2 and B1 = Γ2 , see
Appendix D for details on their evaluation. In the generic
situation, we expect Dφ to be close to 1. Phase disorderaveraging thus forces C2  B2  A2 . This directly
results in the A2 -term being the dominant term in the
square brackets expression in Eq. (30). However, this
term also contains a factor of g1eh that, according to
Eqs. (C4b) and (D2) is also proportional to B1 . Thus,
even this dominating term is in fact highly suppressed
after phase-disorder averaging, because B1  A1 . As
a consequence, the disorder-averaged pair amplitude in
Eq. (30) is small, and we can conclude that both the evenand odd-ω induced pair correlations is highly suppressed
in an MZM array.
Additionally, we have verified that the formation of
bound states due to the coupling between the SPW and
the array of MZMs follows the case discussed in previous section for two MZMs. In fact, we find bound states
emerging at energies around the Majorana splittings δn .
However, unlike the case of two MZMs, where the two
isolated modes are not able to open a gap in the continuum of the SPW spectrum, in the case of an array such a
gap is opened, and the in-gap states also do not acquire
smearing, but, are shifted in energy instead. We briefly
discuss this feature in the following section.
We conclude this analytical part of our work by sum-

(30)

marizing our findings: A MZM coupled to a SPW induces
even- and odd-ω correlations in the SPW, whose amplitude is proportional to Γ2 . Locally in space only oddω pairing exists. When two MZMs are coupled to the
SPW with different complex couplings, delocalized bound
states emerge in the SPW between the two MZMs, and
both pair amplitudes become dependent on the phase difference and proportional to Γ21(2) or Γ1 Γ2 . This already
on the level of two MZMs indicate a suppression of the
induced pairing in the presence of phase disorder in couplings Γi . Finally, for an infinite array, we verify that the
induced pair amplitudes in the SPW are necessarily considerably suppressed under disorder-averaging over the
phases of the complex couplings.

IV.

NUMERICAL RESULTS

In order to demonstrate the effects of phase-disorder,
without relying on the approximations that were essential in obtaining closed-form expressions in the analytical
approach in Sec. III C, such as the Born approximation
for the infinite array, and also going beyond a qualitative interpretation of disorder effects, we next perform
a numerical diagonalization of a tight-binding model described in Sec. II B and add disorder explicitly.
We choose a ring of M = 40 MZMs, with z = 10 atomic
sites between two neighboring MZMs. Since the folded
bands alternate from electron-like to hole-like around momentum p = 0, we center the chemical potential to cut
the third band (l = 2), as it is the first higher electronlike band, and choose a kF = 0.2 π. We then also scan
six equidistant values of the chemical potential, ranging
from the third to the fifth band with the same kF , whose
numerical values are given in Fig. 4(d). This assures that
our results are not fine-tuned but can be interpreted as
general. As the band index increases, the bandwidth also

increases (see e.g. Fig. 2). We therefore choose Γ0 to be
equal to 0.4 of the smaller of the distances from the Fermi
level to the band edge for the lowest scanned band, which
turns out to be Γ0 = 0.0815 t. Since the effects of disorder in the coupling coefficients are investigated, we fix
the energy splitting in each NW to a small finite value
δ = 0.1 Γ0 .
First of all, we verify that keeping the disorder real
(Dφ = 0) reproduces the robustness of the induced SC
correlations, as also found in Ref. 30, and that regardless
of the value of s (the sign bias of the disorder), and also
for relatively large magnitude disorder, up to Dr = 1.
Then, with the value of Γ0 fixed, we generate 20 different
random disorder configurations according to the distribution described in the introduction of Sec. II, using the
parameters s = 1, Dr = 0, and with Dφ ranging through
the values listed in Fig. 4. Here Dr is a dimensionless
measure of the disorder in the coupling given by the relative error of |Γ|2 (see Appendix A). The results of these
calculations are summarized in Figs. 4 and 5.
In Fig. 4 we plot the magnitude of on-site, and thus
dominating, odd-ω component
 of the sample-averaged
anomalous Green’s function GO
eh i,i (i ωm ) as a function
of Matsubara frequency ωm , site location i, and Dφ .
The overall ωm -dependence exhibits a drastic suppression
with phase-disorder strength Dφ , as evident in the logscale plot in Fig. 4(a). We stress that this behavior is thus
very different for the effect of real disorder, where the

pair amplitudes are robust.30 The data in Fig. 4(a) are
the odd-ω component directly under one of the MZMs.
In Figs. 4(b) and (c), we plot the site dependence over
6 out of the 40 periods for both the lowest positive and
a high frequency component. For low frequencies we see
very little site variations. This can be understood from
our analytical results for the single MZM, Eq. (21), where
the decay length is ∼ 1/ωm .30,47 At higher frequencies,
here represented by Fig. 4(c) evaluated at half the bulk
gap Γ0 /2, we find more variations

 with position. The
anomalous Green’s function GO
eh i,i (i Γ0 /2) actually has
peaks (approximately) at a quarter distance from a MZM
with dips both under a MZM, as well as at a mid-point
between them.48
Finally, in the last panel Fig. 4(d) we show how the
low-frequency on-site component is suppressed with disorder for several different values of the chemical potential. Despite the doping-dependence of the DOS, we
find a very similar monotonic suppression with phasedisorder strength, which shows that our results are not
sensitive to the specifics of the model situation. Beyond
the dominant on-site odd-ω contribution to the anomalous Green’s function plotted in Fig. 4, there are also
sub-dominant non-local contributions, in analogy to the
analytical results in Sec. III B, which have both evenω, and odd-ω dependence and are peaked at different
positions along the chain depending on the particular
choice of model parameters. However, they are equiva-

disorder Dφ for µ/t = −1.54 for a 40-unit chain of MZM.

lently suppressed with the dominant on-site contribution
as the phase disorder increases.
In Fig. 5 we focus on the DOS in the SPW and plot
the the site-averaged DOS for several values of the phase
disorder Dφ , for the same parameters as in Fig. 4(a-c).
With increasing disorder we see that the near-zero-energy
peaks (split off zero energy because a finite δ) is diminishing but most notable is that the filling of the energy gap
at finite energies. A crucial difference here compared to
conventional effects of pair-breaking disorder is that the
gap gets filled by smearing of the near-zero-energy peaks
and by states near the gap edge. Thus the in-gap states
are naturally associated with the MZMs, and we interpret
their shift in energy as the formation of non-local bound
states corresponding to phase-matching conditions, similarly to the simplest example of two MZMs considered
in Sec. III B.
Another feature that is prominent in Fig. 5 is the large
peak that occurs near −Γ0 . This peak is more robust to
the disorder than the energy gap. By carefully inspecting
the site-resolved LDOS, we identify this as a contribution
coming from sites that are at a quarter of the MZM distance from a particular MZM. Under an MZM, and at
the midpoint between two MZMs, this peak has actually
the smallest weight. Note here that we plot the electron
DOS thus the DOS is not needed to be symmetric around
zero energy. The missing DOS for creating a symmetric
spectrum are hole-like quasiparticles.

modes (MZMs) when the couplings between these two
systems are complex and acquire different phases. This
corresponds to a realistic situation, as complex couplings
generically appear for varying system parameters and disorder in the phases of the complex couplings is experimentally unavoidable.
First, we have demonstrated that, in general, the pair
correlations induced into the SPW exhibit both even- and
odd-frequency (ω) dependence, which exponentially decay from the position of the MZMs. We have shown this
effect for a single MZM, a pair of MZMs, and for an array
of MZMs. Interestingly, we find that the phases of the
complex couplings get transferred to the pair amplitudes.
Second, we have shown that the induced pair correlations, including the odd-ω component, suffer a considerable suppression due to phase-disorder averaging, exactly
as a consequence of the transferred complex phases. This
is in stark contrast to the effect of real disorder where
the pair amplitudes remain robust.30 We have found this
strong disorder dependence both by analytically evaluating the T -matrix within the second Born approximation
and performing numerical tight-binding calculations for
an array of MZMs.
Third, we find that the suppression of the pair correlations in the SPW occurs concurrently with the filling of the energy gap by in-gap bound states appearing
between spatially-separated MZMs. Carefully analyzing
the situation of a pair of MZM coupled to a SPW, we
have found bound states between the two MZMs that
are highly sensitive to the relative complex phase between the two couplings. We can thus conclude that it is
the complex phases and their disorder that is also causing
the filling of the energy gap.
In summary, our work demonstrates that the conditions favorable for practical realization of a bulk 1D oddω superconductivity from MZMs requires full control of
the system parameters.

CONCLUSIONS
Appendix A: Distribution of coupling coefficients

In this work we have investigated the robustness of the
superconducting pair correlations induced into a spinpolarized wire (SPW) from an array of Majorana zero

In this Appendix we give more details on the distribution used to generate the random coupling strengths. We

11
treat the magnitude and phase of Γ as independent. As
for |Γ|, being a non-negative quantity, it is convenient to
use the (natural) logarithm ln(|Γ|/Γ0 ), which spans the
whole real line. We choose the distribution of the logarithm to be uniform U(fmin , fmax ), with the bounds fmin
and fmax chosen such that:

Because b = λF /2 in this case, λs = λF . On the other
hand, in Fig. 7 it there are nodes on all panels x = 0,
x = b/4, x = b/2 (and, by symmetry at x = 3b/4 and
x = b as well). This implies 2 λs = b, or λs = b/2. Because b = 2 λF in this case, λs = λF . This shows how
the periodicity is set by the Fermi wavelength as stated
in the main text.

Here, Γ0 is to be considered as a constant effective coupling that would reproduce the same T -matrix in Eqs. (8)
and (11), Dr is a dimensionless measure of the disorder
in the coupling given by the relative error of |Γ|2 . In the
case of real couplings, the signs of Γ do not enter Eq. (8),
and, thus, play no effect on the SPW. Nevertheless, we
model a sign bias by a parameter s, −1 ≤ s ≤ 1, being
the difference in the weight of positive and negative signs.
For creating a distribution of complex couplings Γ =
|Γ| ei θ , we choose, strictly by convenience, that the phase
follows a weighted uniform distribution around 0 with
weight (1 + s)/2, and symmetrically around π and −π
with weight (1 − s)/4:

the couplings in Section IV of the main text.

Appendix B: Bound states for two MZMs

In this Appendix we present complementary information for the delocalized bound states in the case of 2
MZMs coupled to a SPW, originally discussed in Fig. 3.
In Figs. 6 and 7 we present the same spectrum as Fig. 3,
but now for b = 0.5 λF , and b = 2 λF . Clearly, the relative position of the nodes and antinodes changes with this
change of MZM-MZM distance. In Fig. 6, the nodes occur at x = 0 (and x = b), while there are peaks or antinodes both at x = b/2 and at x = b/4 (and x = 3b/4), but
clearly highest at x = b/2. This suggests that the wavelength of the standing wave, λs , is λs /2 = b, or λs = 2 b.

T̃ (p; i ωm ), the disordered-average of the matrix T
acting as an impurity T -matrix. The starting point is
Eq. (25) in the main text, which acquires the shorthand
form:

Here, every symbol is a matrix in Nambu and momentum
space, and matrix multiplication involves an integration

an identity matrix in both Nambu and momentum space,
with the Dirac delta in momentum space containing an
extra factor of 2π (1 → 2π δ(p − p00 ) 1̂). With this, all the
rules of matrix algebra are readily applicable to Eq. (C1).

where we have also used Eq. (C5). Summing
P∞ from n = 0
to ∞ in Eq. (C6), and defining Π∗ = n=1 Π∗n , we get
the following equation for X0 :

Then, taking the expectation value, and keeping in mind
that hδV i = hδT i = 0 by definition, we arrive at the
following equation for the expectation value:
hT i = hV i + hV i · g0 · hT i + hδV · g0 · δT i .

(C2)

Subtracting this equation from the full equation, we arrive at the equation for the deviations:
δT = δV + δV · g0 hT i + hV i · g0 · δT +
+ δV · g0 · δT − hδV · g0 · δT i .

(C4a)
(C4b)

The newly introduced matrix g1 incorporates the averaged out effects of the MZM array and is diagonal in
momentum space. Using Eq. (C4b), Eq. (C2) may be
rewritten as:
g0 · hT i = g1 · [hV i + hδV · g0 · δT i] .

X0 = hδV · g0 · δT i
= Π∗ + Π∗ · g1 · hV i .
Plugging this equation into Eq. (C5), and keeping in
mind that g1 · hV i equals g1 · g0−1 − 1 according to
Eq. (C4b), we have:
g0 · hT i = g1 · g0−1 − 1 + g1 · Π∗ +
+ g1 · Π∗ · g1 · g0−1 − g1 · Π∗ ,

(C3)

We see here that to find hT i we need to evaluate the
higher moment hδV · g0 · δT i in Eq. (C2). To calculate
that average, we reformulate Eq. (C3) in a more convenient form in terms of g0 · δT as:
g0 · δT = g1 · [δV + δV · g0 · hT i +
+δV · g0 · δT − hδV · g0 · δT i] ,
g1−1 = g0−1 − hV i .

(C6)

(C5)

Now by multiplying Eq. (C4a) by δV from the left
and taking an average, we see that hδV · g0 · δT i is expressed in terms of the new averages hδV · g1 · δV i, and
h(δV · g1 ) · δV · g0 · δT i:
hδV · g0 · δT i = hδV · g1 · δV i +
+ hδV · g1 · δV i · g0 · hT i +
+ h(δV · g1 ) · δV · g0 · δT i .
Repeating the same procedure by multiplying Eq. (C4a)
by (δV · g1 ) · δV and taking an average, we see that the
average h(δV · g1 )D· δV · g0 · δT i is expressed
E in terms of
2

hgi = g1 + g1 · Π∗ · g1 = g0 + g0 · hT i · g0 .

Eq. (C7) simultaneously defines a “dirty” discrete
Green’s function hgi for the SPW, incorporating the effects of any disorder in the matrices Vn on top of an
averaged-out homogeneous coupling hV i, as well as an
implicit equation for the “dirty” discrete T -matrix hT i.
At this point it is customary to introduce the oneparticle-irreducible self-energies:
Π=

∞ D
E
X
2n−1
(δV · g1 )
· δV
n=1

Π∗ = Π + Π · g1 · Π∗ ,

As a consequence it means that the following recursive relation for the averages Xn
=

(C8)

(C9)

which implies a Dyson equation for hgi:
hgi = g1 + g1 · Π · hgi ⇔ hgi

−1

= g1−1 − Π.

(C10)

By using Eqs. (C4b) and (C10) we may write:
−1

hgi

= g0−1 − Σ, Σ = hV i + Π,

(C11)

which defines the self-energy. Then, using the second
equality in Eq. (C7) for hT i, after some algebra, we obtain:
hT i

− hδV · g1 · δV i · g1 · hδV · g0 · δT i .

,
1PI

where with the Wick contractions we retain only the ones
that cannot be disconnected by “cutting” a g1 line. It is
obvious that this self energy satisfies:

the new average (δV · g1 ) · δV · g0 · δT :

D
E
2
h(δV · g1 ) · δV · g0 · δT i = (δV · g1 ) · δV · g0 · δT −

(C7)

−1

= Σ−1 − g0 .

(C12)

If this equation is compared with an alternative form of
Eq. (C1), namely T −1 = V −1 − g0 , we see that the role
of V −1 after averaging over disorder is played by Σ−1 , or
equivalently, the inverse of the self-energy is the inverse
of V .

1. Calculate hV i from Eq. (24b) and Eq. (8). This
already involves evaluating the first moment, so retaining only this expectation value amounts to the
first Born approximation;
2. Calculate g1 from Eq. (C4b) and from the obtained
result for hV i;
3. Calculate Π by truncating the sum in Eq. (C8) and
from the obtained result for g1 . Retaining only the
first term involves calculating the second moment,
so it amounts to the second Born approximation;
4. Calculate Σ1 to within the same approximation
from Eq. (C11) and using Π1 and hV i;
5. Finally, use Eq. (C12) to calculate hT1 i within the
same approximation.
We now go ahead and follow each of the above steps, but
also reinstate the explicit p and ωm dependence and the
matrix structure in Nambu space.

where the subscript in the averages denotes over which
disordered variable (the coupling coefficients Γ or the energy splitting δ in the NW) the average is taken.
We notice that the electron-hole (and hole-electron)
matrix elements are proportional to an average B1 that
is significantly suppressed under phase averaging because
it carries a phase factor e2iθ as opposed to the average
A1 which is phase independent. Furthermore, if any offdiagonal matrix-element is still non-zero after averaging,
it is odd in frequency because the average Eq. (D2b) is
odd in frequency.
Next, we evaluate g1 . Since both g0 and hV i are proportional to 2π δ(p − p0 ), it follows that ĝ1 (p, p0 ; i ωm ) =
ĝ1 (p; i ωm ) 2π δ(p − p0 ), where:

MZMs always appear in pairs, one at each end of a topological SC wire. If the length of this wire is less than twice
the Majorana localization length, then the Majorana wavefunctions overlap, leading to a finite energy splitting δ.
Here, we couple only one these MZMs to the SPW but
still consider finite δ.
