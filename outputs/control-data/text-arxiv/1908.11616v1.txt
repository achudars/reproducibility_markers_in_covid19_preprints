Isometric immersions of Riemannian manifolds in
k-codimensional Euclidean space
Dan Gregorian Fodor

Abstract
We use a new method to give conditions for the existence of a local
isometric immersion of a Riemannian n-manifold M in Rn+k , for a
given n and k. These equate to the (local) existence of a k-tuple of
scalar fields on the manifold, satisfying a certain non-linear equation
involving the Riemannian curvature tensor of M . Setting k = 1, we
proceed to recover the fundamental theorem of hypersurfaces. In the
case of manifolds of positive sectional curvature and n ≥ 3, we reduce
the solvability of the Gauss and Codazzi equations to the cancelation of
a set of obstructions involving the logarithm of the Riemann curvature
operator. The resulting theorem has a structural similarity to the
Weyl-Schouten theorem, suggesting a parallelism between conformally
flat n-manifolds and those that admit an isometric immersion in Rn+1 .

Introduction
The problem of immersions of manifolds into Euclidean space is well studied.
The Stiefel-Whitney classes [4], Whitney and Nash embedding theorems [5],
and the Cartan-Janet theorem [5] give us lower bounds on the number of
dimensions required to embed various classes of manifolds into Euclidean
space. Here we look into the inverse problem: if we fix the dimension m of
the Euclidean ambient space in which a (local) isometric embedding exists,
what can that tell us about the metric of our manifold? This acts as a sort
of measure for the complexity of the metric, with the simplest metric the
lowest number of dimensions: an n-manifold admits an isometric immersion
in Rn if and only if its metric is flat.

In section 2 we rewrite the (local) immersion of an n-manifold (M, g)
in Rn+k as a section of the Rk bundle over a flat n-manifold (M, f ). Thus,
the existence of a local immersion becomes equivalent to the existence of
a k-tuple of scalar fields hτ , τ ∈ {1..k} such that fab = gab − hτ ;a hτ ;b is a
positive-definite flat metric.
The flatness of f is characterised by the vanishing of its curvature. We
next apply formulas connecting the curvatures of 2 metrics, from [1, Theorem 4.1], to explicitly write the curvature of f in terms of g′ s existing
connection and curvature. Thus we rewrite the existence of a local immersion in Rn+k as the existence of a k-tuple of scalars hτ , satisfying a certain
nonlinear equation involving g ′ s connection and curvature:
(hα;pj hβ ;ik − hα;pk hβ ;ij )(δαβ − hα;a hβ ;b gab )−1 = Rpijk ,
with f positive definite (Theorem 2.3). This is derived by setting the formula
for f ′ s curvature to 0.
In section 3 we study the previous equation for k=1, obtaining:
h;pj h;ik − h;pk h;ij
= Rpijk ,
1 − gab h;a h;b
with positive definitness of f becoming g ab h;a h;b < 1. Thus we characterize
the local existence of an immersion of (M, g) in Rn+1 as the existence of a
scalar field h satisfying the above conditions. This h is basically a height
function lifting the flat manifold (M, f ) into Rn+1 . We show the equivalence of the above criteria to the Gauss and Codazzi equations, setting
Πab = h;ab /(1 − g ab h;a h;b )1/2 . The Codazzi equation Πa[b;c] = 0 becomes an
integrability condition allowing us to recover h form Πab satisfying the Gauss
equation and a set of initial conditions. We then recover the fundamental
theorem of hypersurfaces (Theorem 3.2).
In section 4 we rewrite the Gauss and Codazzi equations in a new form
for manifolds of positive curvature. Considering Rab cd as an operator on the
space of 2-forms, we show there exists Πab satisfying
Πac Πbd − Πad Πbc = Rabcd
∗
if and only if the Weil component of Rabcd
vanishes, with R∗ab cd = ln(Rab cd )
(the logarithm of the curvature operator). Due to positive curvature, Πab
∗
∗ is the Schouten
turns out to be uniquely defined as Πab = ±ePab , where Pab
cd
component of R∗ab (Theorem 4.4). We strengthen these results and rewrite
the fundamental theorem of hypersurfaces (which characterises immersability in an Euclidian subspace of codimension 1) in a form analogous to the

3

Weyl-Schouten theorem (which characterises conformal flatness). This is
done in section 5 as Theorem 5.1.
In section 6 we study submanifolds of (M, g) immersed in Rn+1 obtained
by intersecting the immersion of M with an n-plane. These are just the areas of constant h for particular h. We obtain a formula for the Riemannian
curvature of these manifolds and find it equal to the curvature of the ambient manifold multiplied by a scaling factor greater than or equal 1. Thus, if
we study the cross-sections of the immersion (in Rn+1 ) of an n-sphere with
hyperplanes, they will be (n−1)-spheres with greater (or equal) positive curvature. If we immerse manifolds of negative curvature, the cross-sections will
be manifolds with greater or equal negative curvature. The cross-sections of
immersions of flat manifolds will be flat manifolds.

Notational conventions

Since we use m-tuples of scalars, (or sections of an Rm bundle over the
n-manifold), we need a way to index their elements. In addition to lower
indices Va , signifying covariant tensors, and upper indices V a , signifying contravariant tensors, we shall also use middle indices V α to signify m-tuples,
or sections of the Rm bundle. That is, V α = (V 1, V 2, ...V m). This gives
us two additional rules: just as lower indices contract only with upper indices and vice-versa, so do middle indices contract only with middle indices,
contraction signifying
the ordinary cartesian product over m-vectors in Rm .
Pm
Eg. V ηK η = η=1 V ηK η. Additionally, if a tensor has only middle indices,
then its covariant derivative coincides with its ordinary derivative (this is a
generalisation of the same rule for scalars, as such tensors can be seen as
groupings of scalar-fields).

Conditions for local immersions

If we have an immersion h : M → Rm , of an n-manifold M into Rm , we can
consider it to induce a metric on the manifold, namely the pull-back of the
Euclidean metric along h∗ . Associating to every point of the manifold the
coordinate field hτ , with τ ∈ {1, 2, ...m}, the induced metric is gab = hτ ,a hτ ,b .
Therefore, we have the following:
Definition 2.1. A Riemannian n-manifold M admits a (local) isometric
immersion in Rm if there exists (locally) on the manifold an m-tuple of
scalar fields, hτ , satisfying hτ ,a hτ ,b = gab .

4

The above formulation does not tell us very much about the relationships
between the scalar fields and the intrinsic invariants of M . On the other
hand, we know that an n-manifold admits a local immersion into Rn if and
only if its curvature tensor vanishes. We would like a theorem that appears
as a generalization of this particular case. The remainder of this section will
be devoted to proving such a theorem.
Lemma 2.2. A Riemannian n-manifold (M, g) admits a local isometric
immersion in Rn+k if and only if there exists locally a k-tuple of scalars hτ ,
such that fab = gab − hτ ;a hτ ;b is a flat Riemannian metric.
Proof. Assume there exists locally a k-tuple hτ such that fab = gab −hτ ;a hτ ;b
is a flat metric. We can find a faithful (isometric) coordinate chart m from
(M, fab ) to an open subset Mf of Rn . Consider the Rk -bundle over Mf , and
let hτ be a section of that bundle. The metric associated to (m(p), hτ (p)),
taken as a subset of Mf × Rk , is fab + hτ ,a hτ ,b = fab + hτ ;a hτ ;b = gab .
However, since Mf is a subset of Rn , Mf × Rk can be taken as a subset of
Rn × Rk = Rn+k . In conclusion, (m, hτ ) is a local, isometric immersion of
(M, g) in Rn+k .
Conversely, assume a local isometric immersion i : Mi → Rn+k exists,
with Mi ⊂ M . Select a point q ∈ Mi and choose normal coordinates at
q. Let pT : Mi → (Tq ∼
= Rn ) be defined such that pT (r) is the orthogonal
projection of i(r) onto the tangent bundle of i(Mi ) at i(q). Also, define
pN : Mi → (Nq ∼
= Rk ), such that pN (r) is the orthogonal projection of i(r)
onto the normal bundle of i(Mi ) at i(q).
The identification of the tangent bundle with Rn and normal bundle with
k
R can be made using a standard choice of normal coordinates. Since the
differential of pT at q is the linear isomorphism δab , due to the inverse function
theorem, there exists an open set Mq ⊂ Mi on which pT is a bijection. The
pullback metric induced by pT on Mq is the metric fab of Tq , which is flat.
By setting hτ (r) = pN (r) for r ∈ Mq , the metric obeys the required
equation: gab = fab + hτ ;a hτ ;b for a flat fab , thus completing the proof.

Equation for local immersions

Theorem 2.3. A Riemannian n-manifold (M, g) admits a local isometric
immersion in Rn+k if and only if there exists locally a k-tuple of scalars hα,
satisfying the following equation:
(hm;pj hn;ik − hm;pk hn;ij )((δmn − hm;a hn;b g ab )−1 ) = Rpijk ,
with fab = gab − hk;a hk;b positive definite.

Proof. Lemma 2.2 says the immersion exists if and only if there exists a
k-tuple hτ such that fab = gab − hτ ;a hτ ;b is a flat Euclidean metric.

Now we prove (hτ ;a hp;b (f −1 )ab + δτ p) = (δτ p − hτ ;a hp;b gab )−1 :
(hτ ;a hp;b (f −1 )ab + δτ p)(δpq − hp;a hq;b g ab ) =

Combining with (2), we get:
Rnijk = (hτ ;nj hp;ik − hτ ;nk hp;ij )(δτ p − hτ ;a hp;b gab )−1 ,
thus completing the proof.
The algebraic relationships of [1, Theorem 4.3] suffice to determine whether
the curvature of a metric is 0. However, in cases where the metric can be
pseudo-Euclidean, they do not distinguish between Euclidean and pseudoEuclidean (eg. Minkowski) flat metrics. We construct our immersion as
a section of the Rk bundle over a flat manifold (M, f ). The additional
condition that f be positive definite ensures that M is Euclidean and not
pseudo-Euclidean. Also, it is sufficient to check the condition at a single
point. As f is invertible, no changes of signature occur on its domain of
definition. If we change the signature of f in our theorem from (k, 0) to
(k − p, p), the existence of the hα, α ∈ {1, ..., k}, scalar fields become instead
conditions for the local immersion of our n-manifold in a pseudo-Euclidean
space of signature (n + k − p, p). Many metrics which do not admit local
immersions in an Euclidean space Rn+k may instead admit immersions in a
pseudo-Euclidean space of the same dimension.

Immersion of n-manifolds in Rn+1

Due to its non-linear terms, obstructions to the solvability of (1) appear
difficult to calculate. Here we will study the case when k = 1, that is,
we are immersing an n-manifold into Rn+1 . The k-tuples become singular
scalars, and the equation simplifies to:
h;pj h;ik − h;pk h;ij
= Rpijk .
1 − gab h;a h;b

(3)

The condition that fab is positive-definite becomes gab h;a h;b < 1.
Theorem 3.1. A Riemannian n-manifold M admits a local isometric immersion in Rn+1 if and only if there exists a local scalar field h, satisfying
(3), and gab h;a h;b < 1.

Recovering the fundamental theorem of hypersurfaces

Lemma 3.2. Assume a Riemannian n-manifold (M, g) has a local scalar

field h satisfying Rpijk = ;pj1−g;ikab h;a;pk
. Then Πab = (1−gab h;abh )1/2 sath

isfies Rpijk = Πpj Πik − Πpk Πij (Gauss equation), and Πa[b;c] = 0 (Codazzi
equation).
h

Proof. By substituting Πab = (1−gab h;abh )1/2 into the Gauss and Codazzi
;a ;b
equations, we check they are satisfied.
Lemma 3.3. Assume a Riemannian manifold M has on an open contractible subset N , a symmetric bilinear form Πab satisfying Rpijk = Πpj Πik −
Πpk Πij and Πa[b;c] = 0. Then, for any point p ∈ N , and any initial conditions h, and h;a at p, with h;a h;b gab < 1, there is a maximal open connected
h
set S ⊂ N , p ∈ S, on which there exists h satisfying Πab = (1−gab h;abh )1/2 ,
;a ;b
and the initial conditions at p. The field h is unique.
Proof. The existence of a field of real symmetric bilinear forms Πab satisfying Rpijk = Πpj Πik − Πpk Πij gives the first obstruction to the existence of
h
a height function h, satisfying Πab = (1−gab h;abh )1/2 . Its existence also guar;a ;b

antees that gab h;a h;b < 1 is automatically satisfied, as having gab h;a h;b ≥ 1
would introduce imaginary factors in Π. The form Πab will be shown to be
the second fundamental form of Gauss.
Given the existence of such a form, can we always locally construct h
h
satisfying (1−gab h;abh )1/2 = Πab ? The case of 3-manifolds provides a coun;a ;b
terexample, as 3-manifolds with a given Πab satisfying the Gauss equation
can always be found, yet not all such manifolds admit immersion into R4 .
There exists an additional obstruction, which turns out to be the Codazzi
equation.
We now shall study the obstructions to recovering h from Π. Consider
a path cn : [0, 1] → M from a point p to q, parameterized by natural
parameter t, and fix h;a at p, as an initial condition with gab h;a h;b < 1.
h
Knowing Πab = (1−gab h;abh )1/2 , we can recover h;ab at 0. Thus, we recover
;a ;b
the h;a along the path by integrating the equation:
Dh;a

gab h;a h;b < 1.

This gives us the maximal domain S ⊂ N and the initial conditions for h,
and h;a at p guarantee uniqueness.

The Ricci identity for ha holds if and only if Πa[b;c] = 0. Thus, ha exists
if and only if Πa[b;c] = 0. Or, Πab is a Codazzi tensor. This is the second
obstruction to the local existence of h. However, since Πab is symmetric, so
is h;ab . Therefore, if h;a exists, so does h.

Notes on the extensibility of solutions

Setting initial conditions h and h;a at a given point, we can define and extend
the h field satisfying the above equations in any direction on a contractible
set, until h;a h;b gab = 1. If we take h;a (p) = 0 as initial condition on a point
p, and set |v a Πab v b | ≤ r for v a gab v b = 1, then we can define the h-field on
π
around p. The equation

obtained by maximising (4), for a geodesic ca , gives |h;a | = sin(rd) at a
distance of d from p.
Given a resulting immersion, this is also a lower bound for the injectivity
radius of its projection to the hyperplane tangent to p. As we shall see in the
following theorem, different initial conditions for h at a point result in different immersions that are rigid transformations of one another, and are defined
on different subdomains of m . We can glue them together (applying transformations to their immersion coordinates to make them match) to extend
a solution past the injectivity radius. Note that the resulting h of the exh
tended solution might not always satisfy Πab = (1−gab h;abh )1/2 : there may be

regions past the injectivity radius where it satisfies Πab = − (1−gab h;abh

(see Theorem 3.1). To understand this phenomenon, we shall see how h
behaves on the simple example of the circle immersed in R2 . We have
f : [−π, π] → R2 , f (x) = (cos(x), − sin(x)), giving us h(x) = − sin(x).
The circle has a constant principal curvature of 1, giving us the equations:
1
h′′ = ±(1 − h′ h′ ) 2 . We see that h(x) = − sin(x) satisfies the positive-signed
equation on [0, π2 ] and the negative-signed equation on [− π2 , 0]. At 0 we have
a region on which |h′ | = 1. By reversing the choice of sign of our second
fundamental form, we either reverse the sign of h, or swap the domains on
which these two variants of the equation are satisfied.
Next we present a new proof for the fundamental theorem of hypersurfaces,
[3, Theorem 7.1].
Theorem 3.4. Fundamental theorem of hypersurfaces:
A Riemannian n-manifold M admits a local isometric immersion in Rn+1 if
and only if there exists locally a symmetric Πab satisfying Rabcd = Πac Πbd −
Πad Πbc and Πa[b;c] = 0. For any given Πab satisfying these equations, there
exists a local immersion, unique up to rigid transformations, such that Πab
acts as the second fundamental form of said immersion.
Proof. By choosing a point p ∈ M and setting h;a (p) and h(p) as initial
conditions, the given Πac satisfying the Gauss and Codazzi equations allows us to construct a unique h-field in a neighborhood Mp of p, satisfying
h;ab
= Πab , as shown if Theorem 3.1. The resulting immersion
(1−g ab h h )1/2
;a ;b

will have the form i : Mp → Rn+1 , i(x) = (f τ (x), h(x)), with τ ∈ {1, 2, ..n},
where f τ : Mp → Rn is a local isometric immersion of (Mp , fab ) into Rn , with
fab being the flat metric fab = gab − h;a h;b = f τ ;a f τ ;b , and associated unit1
normal field (1 − gab h;a h;b ) 2 (−f τ;p (f −1 )pk h;k , 1). The proof consists of two
steps: first we show that for an immersion of the form i(x) = (f τ (x), h(x)),
h
the second fundamental form satisfies Πab = (1−gab h;abh )1/2 , then we show
;a ;b

that ”fixing” an immersion of Mp with given Πab , in Rn+1 using a rigid
transformations that identifies the point p with a point i(p) ∈ Rn+1 and
a normal and n-frame at p with an (n + 1)-frame at i(p) is equivalent to
picking the initial conditions of h(p), h;k (p) and f τ : (Mp , fab ) → Rn that
uniquely determine the solution to the equation. As such, all local isometric
immersions of (Mp , g) in Rn+1 with a the same given (scalar-valued) fundamental form Πab are rigid-transformations of one-another.
Lemma 3.5. For a given isometric immersion I υ : (M, g) → Rn+k with

10

υ ∈ {1, 2..n + k}, the second fundamental form (taken as a vector-valued
form with values in the normal-bundle as sub-bundle of Rn+k ) takes the
form Πυ ab = I υ ;ab .
Proof. Let V a be a vector-field and V υ = V a I υ ;a be its pushforward in the
ambient-bundle of the immersion. We have V υ;b = V;ba I υ ;a +V a I υ ;ab . As I υ ;a
acts as a pushforward from the tangent bundle of the manifold to the tangent
bundle of the immersion, using the Gauss formula, we identify Va;b I υ ;a as
the push-forward of the Levi-Civita connection applied to V a , and I υ ;ab as
the second fundamental form, with values in the normal bundle.
Applying to our iǫ : Mp → Rn+1 , i(x) = (f τ (x), h(x)), ǫ ∈ {1, 2, ....n + 1} we
get Πǫab = (f τ ;ab , h;ab ), τ ∈ {1, 2, ....n} as vector-valued second fundamental
form.
1
It can be checked that V ǫ = (1−gab h;a h;b ) 2 (−f τ;p (f −1 )pk h;k , 1) is a valid
choice of unit-normal field , as V ǫV ǫ = 1 (unit) and (V ǫ)(iǫ;p ) = 0 (normal).
We recover our scalar-valued second-fundamental form as Πab = Πǫab V ǫ.
1
This gives Πab = (h;ab − (f τ ;ab f τ;p )(f −1 )pk h;k )(1 − g ab h;a h;b ) 2 . (3)
We have f τ ;ab f τ;p = 21 ((f τ ;a f τ ;p );b + (f τ ;b f τ ;p );a − (f τ ;a f τ ;b );p ) =
= − 12 ((gap − h;a h;p );b + (gbp − h;b h;p );a − (gab − h;a h;b );p ) =
= 12 ((h;a h;p );b + (h;b h;p );a − (h;a h;b );p ) = (−h;ab h;p ) (4)
Substituting (4) in (3) gives:
1
Πab = (h;ab + h;ab h;p (f −1 )pk h;k )(1 − g ab h;a h;b ) 2 =
1
= h;ab (1 + h;p h;k (f −1 )pk )(1 − g ab h;a h;b ) 2 (5)
Equation (2) from the proof of theorem 2.3 gives:
(1 + h;p h;k (f −1 )pk ) = (1 − g ab h;a h;b )−1 .
Substituting in (5) gives:
h
Πab = (1−gab h;abh )1/2 , as expected. This completes the first part of the proof.
;a ;b

Consider an immersion i : Mp → Rn+1 , split as i(x) = (f τ (x), h(x)).
Let (v 1 , v 2 , v 3 ...v n ) be an orthonormal frame at p ∈ Mp , and require that
i(p) = (0, 0...0), ∇i(v k ) = ek , the standard basis at p, and en+1 be the
unit-normal vector of the immersion at i(p). Knowing that en+1 = (0τ , 1)
is the unit-normal at i(p) gives h;k (p) = 0. Additionally, i(p) = (0, 0...0)
gives h(p) = 0. As Πab is given, this determines a unique h-field. We have
gab (p) = fab (p) and iǫ;k (p) = (f τ ;k (p), h;k (p)) = (f τ ;k (p), 0;k ). The immersion f τ : (Mp , fab ) → Rn is required to take p to (0, 0...0) and the frame
(v 1 , v 2 , v 3 ...v n ) ∈ Tp M to (e1 , e2 , e3 ...en ) ∈ T0 Rn . As such, it is uniquely
determined, and so is iǫ for the given Πab satisfying the Gauss and Codazzi
equations. This completes the proof.

Reducing the equation to obstruction-form

In this section we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
of Πab satisfying the Gauss and Codazzi equations (hence the existence of
local immersions) as the vanishing of certain obstructions, in manifolds of
positive-sectional curvature and n ≥ 3.
Proposition 4.1. For a given tensor Rpijk , possessing the symmetries of
the curvature tensor, there exists an n-manifold M immersed in Rn+1 , such
that Rpijk is equal to the Riemannian curvature field of M at a given point, if
and only if there exists a symmetric tensor Πab such that our tensor satisfies:
Πpj Πik − Πpk Πij = Rpijk .
Proof. The fact that an immersion requires the existence of a Πab tensor
was proven above. For the converse, use the Πab tensor to construct the
a b
immersion given by: f : Rn → Rn+1 , f (v n ) = (v n , Πab2v v ). The induced
metric will have the required curvature tensor Rpijk = Πpj Πik − Πpk Πij at
coordinates v n = 0.
Lemma 4.2. A sectionally-positive tensor Rpijk admitting a form Rpijk =
Πpj Πik −Πpk Πij is positive-definite (as an operator on the space of 2-forms).
Proof. Let (v 1 , v 2 , ....v n ) be an orthonormal basis that diagonalizes Πab , with
eigenvalues (λ1 , λ2 , ....λn ). Then the eigenvectors of Rpijk can be written as
{wkp = v k ∧ v p | k, p ∈ {1, 2...n}, k < p}, with eigenvalues λk λp for wkp .
All the eigenvectors are decomposable 2-forms, therefore positive sectional
curvature implies positive-definite curvature.
Corollary 4.3. A sectionally positive curvature tensor that is not positivedefinite requires an Euclidean space of dimension at least n + 2 for the existence of an isometric immersion.
Proof. Assume dimension n + 1 is sufficient for an isometric immersion.
Then, according to Proposition 4.1, there exists a symmetric tensor Πab satisfying Πpj Πik − Πpk Πij = Rpijk . According to Lemma 4.2, a sectionally
positive curvature tensor admiting such a form is positive definite, contradicting our hypothesis. This completes the proof.
Decomposition of the curvature tensor
Given a curvature tensor Rpijk and a fixed metric tensor gab , we recall and
make use of the following standard definitions:

12

The Ricci tensor as Rij = Rk ikj , and the scalar curvature as R = Ra a .
R
(gpj gik − gpk gij ).
The scalar part as Spijk = n(n−1)
The traceless Ricci tensor as Sab = Rab − R

The semi-traceless part as Eabcd = n−2

R
The Schouten tensor as Pab = n−2
(Rab − 2(n−1)
gab ).
The Weyl tensor, or fully-traceless part as
Cabcd = Rabcd − (Eabcd + Spijk ) = Rabcd − (gac Pbd + Pac gbd − Pad gbc − gad Pbc ).
These formulas are usually derived with respect to the Riemann tensor as
base-component, but they can be applied to any (4, 0) symmetric operator on
the space of 2-forms. Let Rab cd be a positive definite Riemann tensor, taken
as an operator on the space of 2-forms. We define R∗ab cd = ln(Rab cd ). Using
this, we can construct a new set of operators from R∗ab cd , analogous to those

as the Weyl-component of Rabcd
defined from Rab cd . For example, Wabcd
Theorem 4.4. Let Rabcd be a positive-definite Riemann tensor and n ≥ 3.
Then Rpijk admits a writing of the form Rpijk = Πpj Πik − Πpk Πij , for a
symmetric Πpk , if and only if the Weyl-component of R∗ab cd = ln(Rab cd ) is

0. Furthermore, the (only) resulting solutions are Πab = ±ePab , where Pab
is the Schouten component of R∗ab cd .
Proof. Assume Rabcd can be written as Πpj Πik − Πpk Πij . Select a basis
(v 1 , v 2 , ....v n ) that diagonalizes Πpk with eigenvalues (λ1 , λ2 , ..., λn ). The
eigenvectors of Rpijk can be written as {wkp = v k ∧ v p | k, p ∈ {1, 2...n}, k <
p}, with eigenvalues λk λp for wkp . Since the eigen-values of Rpijk are all
positive and take the form λk λp , then the eigen-values of any Πij are either
all positive or all negative. If they are all positive, then Πik is uniquely

Rpi kj = e(Rpi ) satisfies Rpijk = Πpj Πik − Πpk Πij , for Πab = ePab , by verifying the two sides have the same eigen-vectors with the same corresponding
eigen-values.
Due to the previous sections, ±Πab are the only solutions.
The uniqueness of Πab implies that for n ≥ 3 and positive sectional
curvature an isometric immersion, if it exists, it is rigid, [2, page 4].
Attempting to extend the procedure to arbitrary curvature runs into
problems, as the logarithm function is not uniquely defined on negativevalued operators. If n ≥ 3 and Rabcd is of rank greater than one, then
it is still true that Rabcd = Πpj Πik − Πpk Πij has either 0 or 2 solutions,
with Π1 = −Π2 . In the case of n = 2, there are an infinite number of
solutions. They satisfy det(Π) = R. Negative curvature operators Rabcd for
n ≥ 3 do not have (real) solutions, as they take the form iΠpj , with Πpj
being a solution for the positive operator −Rabcd . Although manifolds of
negative curvature and dimension greater than 2 do not admit local isometric
immersions in Rn+1 , they may admit immersions in a pseudo-Euclidean
space of signature (n, 1) (see end of Section 2).
Theorem 4.5. For n ≥ 3, a Riemannian n-manifold M of positive sectional curvature admits a local isometric immersion in Rn+1 if and only if
it is of positive curvature operator and the following conditions are satisfied:

Proof. Combine the fundamental theorem of hypersurfaces (Theorem 3.2)
with Lemma 4.2 and Theorem 4.4: The fundamental theorem of hypersurfaces states that for M to admit an isometric immersion in Rn+1 is equivalent
to the existence of Π satisfying the Gauss and Codazzi equations. Lemma
4.2 states that manifolds of sectionally positive curvature satisfying Gauss
equation have positive curvature operators. Theorem 4.4 (applied for manifolds of positive curvature) allows us to rewrite the Gauss and Codazzi
equations in the forms stated above: the existence of Π satisfying the Gauss
∗

equation becomes Cabcd
= 0, with Πab uniquely determined as ±ePab .
For the case of n = 3, this recovers [2, Theorem 7].
Lemma 4.6. For n > 3 and M a Riemannian manifold of positive sectional

∗
curvature, Cabcd
= 0 implies ePa[b;c] = 0. That is, for a manifold of positive
sectional curvature and n > 3, the existence of Πab satisfying the Gauss
equation implies Πab also satisfies the Codazzi equation.

Proof. From Theorem 4.4 we know that Cabcd
∗
a tensor Πab such that Rabcd = Πac Πbd − Πad Πbc , and Πab = ePab . Note that
Π is invertible. Our aim is to prove that Πa[b;c] = 0.
The second Bianchi identity says: Rabcd;e + Rabde;c + Rabec;d = 0;
Denote Tabcde = Rabcd;e + Rabde;c + Rabec;d and Yabc = Πa[b;c] .
Substituting Rabcd = Πac Πbd − Πad Πbc in Tabcde and grouping, we obtain:
Tabcde = 4(Πd[b Ya]ce + Πc[b Ya]ed + Πe[b Ya]dc ).
Let Tbde = Tabcde (Π−1 )ac and Te = Tbde (Π−1 )bd . We have:
Tbde = Tabcde (Π−1 )ac = (n − 3)Ybde + 2Yac[e Πd]b (Π−1 )ac
Te = Tbde (Π−1 )bd = 2(n − 2)Yace (Π−1 )ac .
(n − 2)(n − 3)Ybde = (n − 2)Tbde − T[e Πd]b .
(n − 2)(n − 3)Πb[d;e] = (n − 2)Tbde − T[e Πd]b .
Since Tabcde , Tbde and Te are 0, we know Ybde = Πa[b;c] = 0 for n > 3, thus
completing our proof.

Similarities to the Weyl-Schouten theorem and
conformally flat manifolds

Combining Theorem 4.5 and Lemma 4.6, we obtain the following theorem:
Theorem 5.1. For n ≥ 3, a Riemannian n-manifold M of positive curvature operator admits a local isometric immersion in Rn+1 if and only if,
∗
when n = 3, ePa[b;c] = 0, and
∗
= 0,
when n > 3, Cabcd
∗
∗
where Cabcd and Pab are the Weyl and Schouten tensors of R∗ab cd = ln(R∗ab cd ).
Compare this to the Weyl-Schouten theorem:
Theorem 5.2 (Weyl-Schouten). For n ≥ 3, a Riemannian n-manifold is
conformally flat if and only if,
when n = 3, Pa[b;c] = 0, and
when n > 3, Cabcd = 0,
where Cabcd and Pab are the Weyl and Schouten tensors of Rabcd .
Note that when n = 2, every Riemannian manifold is conformally flat.
Analogously, when n = 2, every Riemannian manifold admits a local isometric immersion in R3 (Cartan-Janet theorem).

Cross-sections and new structures resulting from
immersions

The existence of immersions of an n-manifold M in Rn+k allows for the
study of new geometric structures. We can associate to M a new notion of
distance, the Euclidean distance of the immersed points in Rn+k . When a
global immersion exists, this distance is smooth globally, unlike the intrinsic
distance which is not smooth near its cut locus. Additionally we can study
a new class of p-submanifolds of M , those that appear as the intersection of
M ’s immersion with various (n + p)-hyperplanes of Rn+k .
For our particular approach when k = 1, the (n − 1)-manifolds that
are the cross-sections of M by n-planes are the equipotential lines of h. If
two points have the same h, the Euclidean distance between them is the
distance measured along the resulting flat metric fab = gab − h;a h;b . For any
two points a b, there exists a choice of h such that h(a) = h(b).
We shall calculate the curvature tensor of cross-section (n−1)-submanifolds,
or the manifolds for which h is constant, for a particular h. Let N be such
a submanifold, and RN be its curvature tensor. We shall use a, b, c, d ∈
{1, 2..n} as to index over T M , and i, j, k, l ∈ {1, 2..n − 1} to index over T N .
We know that
(RN )ijkl = (RM )ijkl + (Kik Kjl − Kil Kjk )
where K is the second fundamental form of N as a submanifold on M , RM
is the curvature tensor of M .
We may compute, Kij as the restriction of na;b to T N , where na is a
field of unit co-vectors normal to N . Since h is constant on N , h;a is already
a field of normal vectors. We shall denote Pia to be the linear map from T N
to T M over N , ie. the differential of N ’s immersion map.

(RN )ijkl = (RM )ijkl +(Kik Kjl −Kil Kjk ), we get: (RN )ijkl = gmn h1;m h;n (RM )ijkl .
The curvature tensor of the cross-section manifold, (RN )ijkl , is simply
the restriction/pullback of the curvature tensor of our ambient manifold,
(RM )abcd , with a scaling factor of gmn h1;mh;n .

Conclusion

We have calculated the obstructions to the existence of local isometric immersions in Rn+1 of n-manifolds having positive-sectional curvature. The
resulting theorem has a structural similarity to Weyl-Schouten theorem,
hinting at a relationship between the two classes of manifolds: conformally
flat and locally-hypersurfaces of Rn+1 . Potential further areas of study are
finding links that make this relationship explicit or derive it as a consequence of some more general principle, reductions to obstruction-form of
immersion equations when codimension is higher than 1, and immersions in
various non-Euclidean spaces or with various structures (eq: immersions in
pseudo-Euclidean spaces, complex spaces, immersions of Kähler manifolds,
etc.)
