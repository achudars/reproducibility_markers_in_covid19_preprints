ABSTRACT
Thermally emitting X-ray isolated neutron stars represent excellent targets for testing cooling surface emission
and atmosphere models, which are used to infer physical parameters of the neutron star. Among the seven known
members of this class, RX J1605.3+3249 is the only one that still lacks confirmation of its spin period. Here we
analyze NICER and XMM-Newton observations of RX J1605.3+3249, in order to address its timing and spectral
behavior. Contrary to a previous tentative detection, but in agreement with the recent work by Pires et al. (2019),
we find no significant pulsation with pulsed fraction higher than 1.3% (3σ) for periods above 150 ms. We also
find a limit of 2.6% for periods above 2 ms, despite searches in different energy bands. The X-ray spectrum
can be fit by either a double-blackbody model or by a single-temperature magnetized atmosphere model, both
modified by a Gaussian absorption line at ∼ 0.44 keV. The origin of the absorption feature as a proton cyclotron
line or as an atomic transition in the neutron star atmosphere is discussed. The predictions of the best-fit X-ray
models extended to IR, optical and UV bands are compared with archival data. Our results are interpreted in the
framework of a fallback disk scenario.

1. INTRODUCTION

Isolated Neutron Stars (INSs) are a class of neutron stars
(NSs) with no evidence for any stellar companion and an
undetected or extremely weak radio counterpart (Kaspi et al.
2006). Among these is the group of thermally emitting INSs
discovered by the ROSAT satellite, seven in number, and
hence dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” (M7, Haberl 2007;
Kaplan 2008; Turolla 2009), otherwise called thermally
emitting X-ray Isolated Neutron Stars (XINS, Potekhin et al.
2015).

XINSs are thought to be members of the nearby OB
associations of the Gould Belt (Walter 2001; Popov et al.
2003; Motch et al. 2003, 2005, 2009), located within a
few hundreds of pc from the Sun (Posselt et al. 2007;
van Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2007). Their relatively low X-ray
luminosity (∼ 1031−32 erg s−1 ) is consistent with cooling NSs
of age ∼ 0.5 Myr (Page et al. 2004), in rough agreement
with estimates from their kinematic ages (Page et al. 2006;
Haberl 2007; Motch et al. 2009). Their X-ray spectra are
soft, thermal in nature, and usually fitted by blackbody components with temperatures in the range kT∼ 40 − 100 eV
(e.g., van Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2007; Haberl 2007). Atmospheric emission models have also been proposed to fit

2

M ALACARIA

the thermal emission from INSs (see Potekhin et al. 2016
and references therein). However, low-magnetic-field atmosphere models (Gänsicke et al. 2002; Zavlin & Pavlov
2002) fail to reproduce the spectra of M7 members. On the
other hand, for the highly-magnetized atmosphere models,
high-metallicity (e.g., iron) models predict a large number
of absorption lines that are not observed, while pure hydrogen models reproduce spectral continua that are similar
overall to the observed ones, and imply an effective temperature considerably lower than that suggested by blackbody
models (Pavlov et al. 1996; Ho et al. 2007). Finally, while
blackbody models underachieve the observed flux at optical
wavelengths (Pavlov et al. 1996; Burwitz et al. 2003), atmospheric models overestimate it in some cases.
Timing studies of the M7 members in X-rays reveal
spin periods in the range 3 − 17 s and relatively high
magnetic fields, B∼1013 G (Kaplan et al. 2011; Haberl
2007; Hambaryan et al. 2017). Further commonality is
observed among most M7 members, whose X-ray spectra show broad absorption features at energies ∼ 0.2 −
0.8 keV (Haberl et al. 2003; Zane et al. 2005; Haberl 2007;
van Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2007; Schwope et al. 2007). Such
features are usually attributed either to electron/proton cyclotron resonant scattering features (eCRSF), proton cyclotron absorption features (pCF), or to bound-bound/boundfree transitions in atoms of strongly magnetized NS hydrogen
atmospheres (Zavlin & Pavlov 2002; van Kerkwijk & Kaplan
2007).
The only member of the M7 group that still lacks a coherent timing solution is RX J1605.3+3249 (J1605 hereafter, Schwope et al. 1999). A possible candidate spin period of 6.9 s was tentatively proposed by Haberl (2007) but
not confirmed in later observations. Another possible candidate spin period of 3.4 s (and a spin period derivative of
Ṗ ∼ 1.6 × 10−12 s s−1 ) was proposed for J1605 by Pires et al.
(2014), which however was significant only at a low confidence level (∼ 4σ).
The source distance has been analyzed in several works.
Posselt et al. (2007) find two solutions for the distance,
namely 390 or 325 pc. On the other hand, Motch et al.
(1999) consider closer distance values, as low as ∼ 100 pc,
while Motch et al. (2005) link the source with the Sco OB2
association within the Gould Belt, at a mean distance of
120 − 140 pc. Tetzlaff et al. (2012a) argue that J1605 was
probably born in the Octans association from a supernova
at ≈ 100 pc and calculates the current distance of the NS as
300 − 400 pc.
A spectral feature at ∼ 0.45 keV was first discovered by
van Kerkwijk et al. (2004). Haberl (2007) found two additional absorption lines in the spectrum of J1605 obtained with
XMM-Newton, at energies of 0.59 and 0.78 keV, and consistent with energies in a 2:3:4 ratio. A narrow absorption fea-

ture at 0.58 keV is also found by van Kerkwijk et al. (2004)
and Hohle et al. (2012) using the high energy-resolution instrument (RGS) on-board XMM-Newton, with a width of
3.3 eV. Further analysis of XMM-Newton data by Pires et al.
(2014) also finds significant absorption lines in J1605 at
slightly different energies than previous works, that is 0.44,
0.58, and 0.83 keV, while Pires et al. (2019) find no evidence
of other absorption features than that at ∼ 0.4 eV.
In this work we report the results of recent observations
of J1605 performed with XMM-Newton (XMM) plus unpublished observations performed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We perform timing and
spectral analysis in order to address open questions about
J1605’s main properties. Combining both NICER and XMM,
our observations do not show evidence of pulsations in the
X-ray light curve of J1605. Moreover, our long NICER exposures allow to perform the most sensitive pulse search down
to 2 ms to date. The measured spectra are well fitted by a
double-blackbody model or by a magnetized hydrogen atmospheric emission model, and we also confirm the presence
of a broad absorption feature at ∼ 0.45 keV. Our timing and
spectral results are consistent with the most recent work by
Pires et al. (2019). We integrate archival IR/Optical/UV data
in our study, and interpret our findings in the context of the
most recent XINS emission scenarios and the incidence of
emission and absorption of their surrounding medium.
2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

In this work, we analyzed available NICER data for J1605,
and only the most recent XMM data. The NICER and XMM
observation log is reported in Table 1.
2.1. NICER
The NICER X-ray Timing Instrument (XTI, Gendreau et al.
2016) is an array of 56 co-aligned X-ray concentrator optics,
each associated with a silicon drift detector sensitive in the
0.2 − 12 keV band (Prigozhin et al. 2012). A single concentrator consists of 24 nested grazing-incidence gold-coated
aluminum foil mirrors, parabolically shaped with a common
focal length. To date, 52 detectors are operating, providing a
peak effective area of 1900 cm2 at ∼ 1.5 keV, with an energy
resolution of ∼ 100 eV and a photon time-tagging resolution of ∼ 100 ns. With an effective area at 1 keV of about
2000 cm2 (that is about 2 times that of XMM-pn and several
times that of Chandra/ACIS), NICER perfectly matches the
needs to analyze soft, thermal emission from NSs.
NICER observed J1605 for a total of 32 segments between 2017 July 19 (Obs ID: 1032020101) and 2018 April
8 (Obs ID: 103202032), collecting a total of ∼ 165 ks of unfiltered exposure. The data were reduced using the software
HEASOFT version 6.23 and NICERDAS version 2018-03-

01_V0041. Because of the low intrinsic source flux and the
relatively high spectroscopic sensitivity needed for the purposes of the present work, accurate background removal is
important. Good Time Intervals (GTIs) were first created
applying standard filtering (e.g., removing events detected
during South Atlantic Anomaly passages). Then, further
filtering was applied to remove high particle-radiation intervals associated with the Earth’s auroral zones, i.e., “the
polar horns”, by applying a cut on the cutoff rigidity with
COR_SAX>4.0. In addition, detectors flagged as “hot” by
the data analysis software were removed for each observation. Then, GTIs were separated into times when NICER
was exposed to direct sunlight (orbit day), and times when
the satellite was within the Earth shadow (orbit night). This
procedure deals with different background components separately, such as the optical loading prominent only during day
orbits at energies below ∼ 0.35 keV. In this way low energy
data are free from artificial structures, although at the expense of a considerable amount of exposure time. This does
not represent the standard procedure for NICER data analysis but ensures a low background level in the energy range
∼ 0.3 − 0.5 keV, where an absorption feature is expected (see
Section 1). Finally, a flat count rate cut (at ∼ 10 c/s) to the resulting 0.25−12 keV light curve was applied to remove possible remaining background flaring events. The resulting final
exposures are 58 ks and 16 ks for day and night orbits, respectively. The source spectra were grouped using the GRPPHA
tool to have a minimum of 25 counts per bin. The most recent response files provided by the NICER instrumental calibration team were used2 .
Background spectra were created from data acquired from
one of seven “blank sky” targets based on the Rossi X-Ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE) background fields (Jahoda et al.
2006). Among the seven available fields, we selected the target with the smallest angular separation from J1605 (BKGD
#8, ∆θ ∼ 45◦ ). All observations of the background field
were reduced as described above. The resulting final exposures are 10 ks and 15 ks for day and night background
spectra, respectively.
Source counts are 1.5 × 105 and 2.2 × 105, corresponding
to a mean count rate of 5.9 and 3.6 s−1 for night and day
spectra, respectively, and accounting for about 94% of the
total.
2.2. XMM-Newton
XMM observed J1605 a total of four times between 2015
July 21 (Obs ID: 0764460201) and 2016 February 10 (Obs
ID: 0764460501). In this work, we only use data from the
XMM European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) cameras—

a Unfiltered times.

i.e., the PN CCD (Strüder et al. 2001) and the MOS CCDs
(Turner et al. 2001)—both sensitive in the 0.15 − 12 keV
range and offering spectral resolution E/∆ E ∼ 20 − 50 at
6.5 keV (see Pires et al. 2019, for analysis of RGS data).
However, as J1605 has a soft spectrum, to avoid background contamination we restricted our analysis to the range
0.2 − 1.2 keV. The PN and MOS cameras were set in Full
and Large Window modes with thin filters, respectively. The
total unfiltered exposure was ∼ 325 ks. Data reduction was
performed using the Science Analysis System (SAS) software xmmsas_20170719_1539-16.1.0, with the latest available calibration files. Step-by-step reduction was

4

M ALACARIA

performed following the official SAS Science Threads3 . To
remove high background flaring activity for EPIC cameras,
single event (PATTERN==0), high energy light curves were
extracted for each camera; then, a count-rate threshold was
chosen corresponding to the low and steady background.
Applying such a threshold to the light curves resulted in the
selection of Good Time Intervals. For the pn-camera, single
and double events were selected (pattern≤4), while single, double, triple, and quadruple events were accepted for
the MOS cameras (pattern≤12). Background circular
′′
′′
regions of size 60 to 100 were defined off-source, on the
same chip as the target for the PN camera, while on a different yet close and largely source-free chip for MOS, and used
to generate background spectra. PN and MOS spectra were
extracted separately for each observation.
Because of the relatively high source flux, the thin filter,
and the Full/Large Window observing mode, the observations are affected by pile-up at a few percent level in both PN
and MOS cameras. Even though the observed count rate is
within “tolerant” levels according to Jethwa et al. (2015), we
opted for a conservative approach in order to ensure a confident energy redistribution of the recorded events, thus helping in constraining spectral parameters and spectral features.
To minimize the resulting spectral distortion, we excised the
core of the Point Spread Function (PSF) in each observation
and extracted counts in an annulus centered on the source,
retaining only the lower count-rate wings of the PSF. To optimize the excising radius, we excluded progressively larger
radii of the PSF core (up to a radius of about 15′′ ), testing
their impact on the pile-up reduction using the epatplot
task4 until pile-up effects were negligible. This resulted in a
loss of about 10 and 20% of the original MOS and PN camera
exposures, respectively.
We then used the SAS task epicspeccombine to combine spectra in order to improve statistics. However, we notice that according to the SAS team the task can be used only
to merge spectra and response files that have been generated
in the same PI channel interval, but also that selecting a spectrum with a non-standard PI range results in wrong response
matrices and therefore unreliable spectra5 . For this reason,
we merged all the different cameras’ spectra separately, ending up with one merged PN spectrum and one merged MOS
spectrum. The resulting final exposures are 285 and 280 ks
for MOS2 and MOS1 and 225 ks for PN. Spectral bins have
been grouped to have a minimum of 25 counts per spectral
bin while the maximum oversample of the instrumental energy resolution was fixed to a factor of 3.

3. ANALYSIS

3.1. Pulsation Searches
To search for a periodic pulsed signal associated with the
rotation of the NS, the event detection times were first translated to the Solar System barycenter with the barycorr
tool in HEASOFT for NICER and the barycen task in SAS
for XMM. For this purpose we adopted the DE405 Solar System ephemeris and the position of J1605 derived from the
XMM EPIC pn imaging data from the longest exposure (Obs
ID 0764460201), RA=16:05:18.48, Dec=+32:49:21.0.
The periodicity searches were conducted using the PRESTO
Fourier-domain pulsar search software package (Ransom et al.
2002). The acceleration search technique implemented in
PRESTO allowed us to coherently search long time series
(up to several months) by considering a wide range of frequency drifts caused by a range of possible rotational spindown values of the neutron star. For XMM, only the EPIC
PN data were used for this analysis, due to the significantly
greater sensitivity and better time resolution (∆t = 73.4 ms)
of this instrument compared to the MOS cameras (∆t = 0.9
s). In addition, just a subset of the NICER observations were
used for the pulsation search—in particular, the observations
taken in 2017 July 19–24 (22.4 ks of unfiltered exposure),
2017 October 25–30 (42.4 ks unfiltered exposure), and 2017
December 1–27 (82.7 ks unfiltered exposure), as they provide the most compact set of deep exposures, which is desirable for sensitive coherent pulsation searches. These NICER
subsets from July, October, and December data was first
searched separately and also combined to perform a coherent
search.
The XMM events were binned at the intrinsic EPIC pn 73.4
ms detector time resolution, while the events from NICER
(which has an absolute time resolution of ∼100 ns) were
binned at a time resolution of 0.977 ms (1024 Hz) for the
separate searches of the 2017 July, October, and December
subsets. To coherently search the combined October and December NICER event lists, we used a 0.0625 s binning, and
to search the July–December data set, we used a time binning
of 0.25 s.
We first conducted periodicity searches over the 0.3–1.2
keV band. However, since J1605 may exhibit a multitemperature thermal spectrum as suggested in previous
works (e.g., Pires et al. 2014) and shown in Section 3.2, it
is possible that pulsations may only arise from the hotter
and smaller regions on the stellar surface. Alternatively,
the pulsations of the cool and hot emission regions may be
significantly out of phase such that pulsations are strongly
suppressed when integrated over the full 0.3–1.2 keV band
(see, e.g., Gotthelf & Halpern 2009, for the curious case of
the Puppis A pulsar). To account for this scenario, we conducted additional searches for periodicity restricted to events

NICER AND XMM

OBSERVATION OF

in the 0.3–0.5 keV and 0.8–1.2 keV bands, where the cool
and hot components dominate, respectively.
The XINS RX J0720.4−3125 (Borghese et al. 2015) and
RX J1308.6+2127 (Borghese et al. 2017) are known to exhibit narrow absorption features that only appear over a fraction of their rotation periods. In principle, the same could
be the case for J1605 such that pronounced pulsations at
the neutron star rotation period only occur in the absorption
line. Motivated by this prospect, we conducted searches using only events in the energy range around the absorption
feature apparent in the X-ray spectrum, 0.4–0.5 keV.
No statistically significant (≥ 4σ, as determined by the Zn2
test; see Buccheri et al. 1983) periodic signals are found in
either the NICER or XMM data sets for any choice of energy band. From the XMM data we can set a 3σ upper limit
of 1.3% on the pulsed fraction over the 0.3–1.2 keV band,
assuming a sinusoidal pulse, for spin periods greater than
0.1468 s, comparable to what Pires et al. (2019) find. For the
NICER data in the 0.3–1.2 keV band, after accounting for
the additional number of trials from the acceleration search,
we obtain a pulsed fraction limit of <2.6% for spin periods
greater than 1.95 ms from the 2017 December observations,
a <1.6% limit for periods greater than 0.125 s by combining
the 2017 October and December observations. Including the
NICER exposures from 2017 July 19–24 data does not result
in a significant improvement in sensitivity to pulsations due
to the 3 month gap and shorter exposure relative to the October and December data, yielding a <1.6% limit for periods
>0.5 s. The <2.6% limit (at 3σ) for short periods (>2 ms) is
significantly stronger than the 3.2–5.0% limits (at 2σ) for periods >1.2 ms obtained by van Kerkwijk et al. (2004) using
XMM pn fast timing data (see in particular their Table 3).
The absence of pulsations in substantially deeper exposures indicates that the period reported in Pires et al. (2014)
based on a 60 ks XMM exposure was spurious, in agreement

3.2. Spectral analysis
Spectra were fitted using the XSPEC 12.10.0 package
(Arnaud 1996). We fitted NICER (day and night) and XMM
(pn and MOS) spectra simultaneously, allowing for a crossnormalization factor among the different spectra. The energy
band for fitting was limited to 0.2 − 1.2 keV, above which the
background dominates.
Photoelectric absorption model and elemental abundances
were set according to Wilms et al. (2000) (tbabs in XSPEC)
to account for photoelectric absorption by neutral interstellar
matter (or column density NH ), and assuming model-relative
(wilm) solar abundances. During our spectral analysis we
allowed the column density parameter to vary (although we
also explored the case where the absorption column density
was kept fixed to the Galactic value, 2.4 × 1020 cm−2 ). This

resulted in values larger than the Galactic NH value to the
source (∼ 3 − 5 × 1020 cm−2 ), as well as larger than the value
found in previous works (e.g., van Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2007;
Pires et al. 2014). This is similar to what Pires et al. (2019)
also found, i.e. nominal values of the NH parameter generally higher than Galactic (that is, in the range 2.5 − 5.3 ×
1020 cm−2 ). Moreover, as discussed in Viganò et al. (2014),
the single-blackbody model used in previous works to fit the
X-ray data of J1605 (see Section 1) tends to underestimate
NH by 20 − 30% with respect to the actual value. However,
the higher than Galactic NH value in the case of J1605 is related to the co-variance with the parameters of the broad absorption line at ∼ 0.4 keV and to our ignorance of the true
continuum spectral shape. We also verified that employing different absorption models (e.g., wabs in XSPEC, see
Morrison & McCammon 1983) and abundances (e.g., angr
in XSPEC, see Anders & Grevesse 1989) returns consistent
NH values to those obtained using the tbabs model.

fied by at least one Gaussian absorption line at 0.45 keV
(van Kerkwijk et al. 2004; Pires et al. 2014) and we tested
both models to fit our data. We used the bbodyrad model
(instead of the simpler bbody) from XSPEC because it allows to link the normalization K of the blackbody component to the emitting surface area through the relation
K = R2km /D210 kpc , where Rkm is the radius of the emitting
surface in units of km and D10 kpc is the distance from the
source in units of 10 kpc. A single-blackbody model returns
a reduced χ2 > 5 (for 488 d.o.f.). Our data are best fit by an
absorbed double-blackbody model with an absorption feature at ∼ 0.43 keV (see Table 2). The absorption feature
has been modeled with a Gaussian profile (the multiplicative
gabs component in XSPEC):

where Eabs is the line centroid energy, τabs and σabs are
the optical depth and the width of the line, respectively.
The second blackbody component and the absorption feature
improve the reduced χ2 to a value of 2.4 and 1.1, respectively. The blackbody temperatures and absorption line energy are in general agreement with findings from Pires et al.
(2019). On the contrary, previous works (e.g., Haberl 2007;
Pires et al. 2014) require additional absorption features at
∼ 0.58 and 0.8 keV. However, we note that the observation
of spectral features in the spectra of XINS can be modeldependent, and can also depend on the exact details of the
analysis. Moreover, previous results based on XMM observations of J1605 are now superseded by Pires et al. (2019) analysis and data set. On the other hand, we notice that results
from Haberl (2007) are obtained using a single-temperature
blackbody model and can not therefore be compared to that
used in the present work. Moreover, the fit obtained by
Haberl (2007) is only marginally acceptable, with a reduced
χ2red ∼ 1.4, and structured residuals resulting from the best-fit
model.
The absorption feature found in previous works at
∼ 0.58 keV (van Kerkwijk et al. 2004; Hohle et al. 2012;
Pires et al. 2014) is narrow (Gaussian width in the range
∼ 3 − 16 eV) and needs the resolution power of instruments
like RGS on board XMM to be resolved, which is beyond the
scope of the present work. However, we note that Pires et al.
(2019) also found no evidence of the narrow absorption feature at ∼ 0.58 keV in the most recent XMM-RGS observations.
Finally, we note that Schwope et al. (2007) find that the
energy of the two absorption features observed in the XINS
RBS 1223 spectrum considerably changes among different observations, with the lowest energy absorption feature
changing from 0.39 keV in 2003 to 0.20 keV in 2005 and the

higher energy absorption feature going from undetected to
0.73 keV, respectively (while roughly harmonic in the rest
of the observations). Therefore, the centroid energy of the
detected features may vary on time scales of years (a somewhat analogous phenomenon is observed in accreting NSs,
e.g. Her X-1 Staubert et al. 2016, although the accretion process in those sources is likely responsible for the long-term
variation of the cyclotron line energy). More recent works
(Hambaryan et al. 2011; Borghese et al. 2017) also find inconsistent line energies for RBS 1223, although the inconsistency might be due to the difference in the analysis approach.
More complex, physical models have also been tested,
such as those representing the X-ray spectrum emitted from
the atmosphere of a NS. Various NS atmospheric models have been proposed in the literature, and tested in the
present work, e.g., the magnetic/non-magnetic versions
of the fully ionized hydrogen atmosphere model (NSA in
XSPEC, Zavlin et al. 1996; Pavlov et al. 1995), the nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere model with variable surface
gravitational acceleration (NSAGRAV in XSPEC, Zavlin et al.
1996), and the weakly/strongly magnetized versions of the
partially ionized atmospheric model that allows for variable
surface gravitational acceleration and is composed of hydrogen (H) or heavier elements (e.g., carbon, oxygen, iron,
NSX and NSMAXG model in XSPEC, Ho & Heinke 2009; Ho
2014). Among all tested atmospheric models, the only ones
that returned an acceptable fit were (1) the NSA model in the
magnetic case (B=1013 G); and (2) the NSMAXG model with
B=1013 G, the latter with the distance and normalization values kept fixed (see Table 2). None of the other tested combinations of the above mentioned atmospheric models returned
a statistically acceptable fit or physically meaningful values of the model parameters, and will not be discussed further. Moreover, we stress that the source distance commonly
adopted in the literature (∼ 350 pc; see, e.g., Posselt et al.
2007) is nonetheless uncertain and cannot be readily accommodated by our data, while a possible distance of ∼ 150 pc
(see Section 1) is consistent with our data.
Similarly to the double-blackbody model, the atmospheric model fits also require a Gaussian absorption line at
∼ 0.45 keV. Finally, because the NSA model is developed for
a standard gravitational acceleration g = 2.43 × 1014 cm s−2 ,
corresponding to standard NS mass MNS = 1.4 M⊙ and radius
RNS = 10 km, these two parameters were kept fixed during the
fitting procedure6.
Analogous spectral continuum models and spectral features have been employed by Pires et al. (2019) to fit XMM
data of J1605. Their spectral results are overall consistent
with those found in the present work. However, their best6

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. A double-blackbody model for the continuum emission
The spectral continuum of XINS is broadly consistent
with a single-temperature blackbody component (kTbb ∼ 40 −
100 eV) slightly modified by interstellar absorption (NH ∼
1020 cm−2 ). This result is generally interpreted as thermal
emission from the NS surface. However, with the availability of high signal-to-noise spectra, deviations from that
simple model emerge (see, e.g., Zane et al. 2011 and references therein). Phase-averaged as well as phase-resolved
spectra from XINS generally are better fitted by a combination of two or three blackbody components, physically interpreted as coming from different regions of the star surface.
Such deviations from a purely single-temperature component
are expected as the result of an inhomogeneous temperature
distribution across the NS surface, expected from theoretical arguments and stemming from the presence of strong
magnetic fields causing, e.g., anisotropic thermal conductivity and non-spherically symmetric magnetic field dissipation, leading to the presence of hot spots (Page et al. 2007;
Pons et al. 2009). In particular, the origin of the doubleblackbody continuum is generally attributed to two thermally
emitting spots: a smaller hot spot, usually associated with the

magnetic poles, and a larger cool spot as wide as the NS itself
and due to the cooling surface.
Our analysis finds that a double-blackbody model fits well
the continuum emission from J1605 (see Figure 1). The
temperatures of the cold and hot regions are 63 and 119 eV,
respectively, in general agreement with previous work on
J1605 and other XINS. Assuming a 10 km-radius NS for
the cold component (see Section 4.3) we get a distance of
∼ 174+127
−80 pc, while the normalization of the hot component,
given a nominal distance of 174 pc returns a radius of the
emitting hot spot equal to ∼ 0.76+0.18
−0.18 km. The case of the
double-blackbody model with the column density value fixed
to the Galactic value (NH = 2.4 × 1020 cm−2 ) has also been investigated. This model fits well the X-ray data (χ2red /d.o. f . =
1.14/484) and returns a distance of 393 ± 18 pc, more in line
with previous works (Tetzlaff et al. 2012b, and references
therein, see also Sect. 1), while both the hot and cold blackbody components show about 10 eV hotter temperature values.
Finally, to investigate deviations from a pure, singleblackbody continuum as found in Motch et al. (2005) for
J1605, we compared that with the broadband spectral energy
distribution obtained from our double-blackbody model. Our
results are presented in Fig. 3. Below ∼ 0.5 keV, the flux predicted by the double-blackbody model is about 10 times
higher than that predicted by the single-blackbody, while
the hot blackbody component returns a spectrum that is
roughly comparable to that of the single-blackbody model of
Motch et al. (2005), considering the relatively small difference between the temperature values (119 and 99 eV, respec-

tively). However, the cold component brings an important
contribution to the soft X-ray band (. 0.5 keV), modifying
the emerging spectrum at softer X-ray energies.
An important consequence deriving from the inclusion of
a cold component is the model prediction at lower wavelengths, namely in the IR/optical/UV band. Fig. 3 compares
the prediction of our model with Hubble Space Telescope
(HST)/Subaru optical/UV data from Kaplan et al. (2003);
Motch et al. (2005); Kaplan et al. (2011) as well as WISE
and Spitzer IR data (Posselt et al. 2014). Optical/UV magnitudes have been converted to flux according to the standard
STDMAG conversion (Kaplan et al. 2003, 2011), and corrected to account for optical extinction following the empirical relation described in Foight et al. (2016), NH = (2.87 ±
0.12) × 1021 AV cm−2 (which, however, suffers from considerable scatter at low NH values such as those derived for
J1605). The model can fit optical data from the B to the R
band without requiring additional components or conditions,
such as a power law component or a thin hydrogen atmosphere (Motch et al. 2003, 2005; Ho et al. 2007). This is a
direct result of the inclusion of a second, colder blackbody

component in the fit. However, as illustrated by Kaplan et al.
(2011), J1605’s optical/UV data show a trend that is less
steep than a ∝ λ−4 , blackbody-like function. As a result, the
nominal double-blackbody model fits the optical data but results in an overestimation of the UV flux, consistent with it
only within the large uncertainty (see Figure 3).
4.2. The fallback disk scenario
As outlined in Sect. 4.1 and Fig. 3, the best-fit doubleblackbody model is subject to further considerations. If
the physical interpretation of the double-blackbody model is
plausible, and only the nominal predicted values are considered, then a mechanism must be at work to suppress the inferred flux in the UV band. A possible mechanism responsible for the suppression of the UV flux in XINS is due to
potential fallback disks or dusty belts surrounding the compact object which are, at least in some cases, indicated as
a distinct possibility (Perna et al. 2000; Posselt et al. 2014,
2018). When present, dust grains around the NS are heated
by the UV radiation, for which the grains behave as nearly
perfect absorbers, thus reradiating the absorbed flux in the

NICER AND XMM

OBSERVATION OF

infrared band. However, the double-blackbody model predicts a flux that is ∼3 times larger than that observed in UV
(see Fig. 3), which requires absorption values of a few times
1021 cm−2 , that is about 10 times the Galactic value to the
source, and many times the amount observed in our best-fit
model (see Table 2). Assuming that the fallback disk is distributed as a torus with inner and outer radii of 1010 and 1016
cm, respectively (see Posselt et al. 2014), a column density
of 3 × 1021 cm−2 corresponds to a torus mass of about 30 M⊕ .
The IR emission from such a massive torus would therefore
be intense, e.g. according to Eq. 1 in Posselt et al. (2014),
of the order of 102 mJy at 160µm and for a source distance
of 173 pc. However, Posselt et al. (2014) found no significant infrared counterpart at the position of J1605, a result that
puts upper limits on the IR emission from this source, < 12.2
mJy at 160 µm (that is, approximately 18 keV s−1 cm−2 keV−1
at 8 × 10−6 keV, see Fig. 3 for comparison) and on the possible disk mass, < 2.2 M⊕ . Therefore, a dusty fallback disk
surrounding the NS seems unsuitable to explain the UV suppression implied by the double-blackbody model. Alternatively, the best-fit double blackbody model with the column
density value fixed to the Galactic value can be considered.
Fig. 3 shows that this model is consistent with the UV data
point (at ∼ 10−2 keV), but not with the optical data. This result can be interpreted in terms of the model employed by
Ertan et al. (2017), where the optical flux is emitted mainly
from the inner rim of the fallback disk in the form of a blackbody spectrum. In Fig. 3 we show a blackbody model with
kTeff ∼ 1.3 keV and optical flux Fopt ∼ 10−3 FX , where FX is
the X-ray flux. These values are typical of XINS (Ertan et al.
2017) and result to fit well the optical data leaving the UV
flux almost unaffected.
4.3. An atmospheric model for the continuum emission
Besides the double-blackbody model, X-ray spectra from
J1605 analyzed in this work are equally well fit by specific
configurations of the atmospheric NSA and NSMAXG models
(see Table 2). In our analysis, both models assume constant
magnetic field strength and temperature across the NS surface. While one could expect magnetic field (and temperature) variation across the emission region, the non-detection
of pulsations (see Section 3.1) supports our assumption.
The NSA model provides the effective unredshifted temperature of the NS surface and can be fitted for a few (fixed)
values of the magnetic field, while providing the source distance as a free parameter. Our data are well fitted by the
NSA model with B= 1013 G. Similar to the double-blackbody
model employed in Section 4.1, the normalization factor
Katmos of the NSA model is linked to the distance d (in
units of parsec) through the relation KNSA = 1/d 2 , thus resulting in a distance of 92+5
−5 pc, consistent with the results
from Section 4.1 and those hinted by Motch et al. (1999,

RX J1605.3+3249

2005). The surface temperature returned by this model is
log Teff = 5.737 ± 0.005 K (47.0 ± 0.5 eV).
A constrained configuration of the NSMAXG model has also
been found to fit the data. The best-fit NSMAXG model consists of a magnetized (B= 1013 G) NS at a fixed distance
of 100 pc and a normalization value, equal to the ratio of
the emitting region compared to the NS radius (Rem /RNS )2
fixed to unity. This model returns a similar surface temperature as that of the NSA model, log Teff = 5.729+0.016

(46.2+1.7
eV),
and

version
of
the

NS,
−2.3
with MNS = 2.04 M⊙ and RNS = 15.6 km (corresponding to a
gravitational redshift of zg = 0.28).
In analogy with Section 4.1, the NSA and NSMAXG models also have been tested with the absorption column density fixed to the Galactic value. However, these models do
not fit the data well, leaving enhanced wave-like residuals
(χ2red = 1.4), especially in the softest (< 0.35 keV) part of the
spectrum, and will not be further discussed.
Although atmospheric models have been found to satisfactorily fit the X-ray emission of XINS in previous work
as well, the temperature values so obtained generally overestimate the observed optical flux by a factor of ∼ 10 − 100
(see, e.g., Pavlov et al. 1996; Pons et al. 2009; Motch et al.
2003; Burwitz et al. 2003). For this, we compare the NSA
model predictions with the optical/UV data provided in
Motch et al. (2005); Kaplan et al. (2003, 2011), as well as
with the double-blackbody model (see Section 4.1). In fact,
at energies softer than the X-ray domain, the blackbody
and the NSA models both follow a power-law, F(λ) ∝ λ−4
(see also Ho et al. 2008). However, the NSA model spectra
implemented in XSPEC only extends down to 0.05 keV. Furthermore, at B = 1013 G, the proton cyclotron spectral feature
occurs at 0.063 keV and significantly distorts the continuum
spectrum near this energy (see Figure 3). This prevents extending the NSA model to optical wavelengths in the form
of a power-law. Thus, in order to illustrate a fully ionized
hydrogen atmosphere spectrum at optical wavelengths, we
compute and show an analogous spectrum (i.e., a NSA-like
model) using the method described in Ho & Lai (2001) and
values obtained from the NSA best-fit (see Table 2). As
shown in Fig. 3, the NSA-like model is consistent at optical
wavelengths with the double-blackbody model within its relatively large uncertainty. This is still noticeable, since other
XINS show high discrepancy between the two models (as reported above). On the other hand, the best-fit NSMAXG model
shows a discrepancy from the nominal double-blackbody at
optical wavelengths by a factor of almost 5. Note that the
NSMAXG spectrum shown in Figure 3 takes into account the
dense-plasma effect described by Ho et al. (2003), which
occurs when photons of frequency below the local plasma
frequency have their propagation hindered; this effect causes
the spectrum to deviate from a λ−4 behavior but the pre-

10

M ALACARIA

cise nature of the deviation is uncertain, and therefore the
spectrum shown here is not definitive.
Finally, in Figure 3 we also show the low-energy tail predicted by the NSA model (∝ λ−4 ) approximated as a blackbody spectrum (dashed yellow line) whose temperature is
equal to that found by the best-fit model of the NSA component (log Teff = 5.737 K, see Table 2) and corrected by a
color factor of 2.57 . Despite the fact that color factors found
by those authors and employed here are computed for nonmagnetic models, it is remarkable how well the resulting
spectrum meets the double-blackbody model at optical/UV
wavelengths. The NSA model so obtained, similarly to the
nominal double-blackbody model, is consistent with the optical data but not with the UV data, leading to a possible similar interpretation (see Section 4.1).
4.4. A pCF origin for the absorption feature
Spectral absorption features are commonly observed
among XINS. These features are usually attributed to electron or proton cyclotron interactions, and/or to electronic
transitions in partially ionized or condensed atmospheres (see
Section 4.5). However, absorption features have been also
shown to result spuriously as a consequence of fitting, e.g.,
multi-temperature blackbody emission models (Viganò et al.
2014).
A cyclotron resonant feature is expected in NSs with high
(B ≥ 1012 G) magnetic fields, where the electron/proton motion perpendicular to the magnetic field lines is quantized in
discrete Landau levels, and so are the energies corresponding
to those levels, thus resulting in resonant scattering of photons at those energies. The energy of the fundamental line
is
ECRSF ≈

11.6 me
B12 keV
(1 + zg) mx

(2)

where B12 is the magnetic field in units of 1012 G, me and mx
are the mass of the electron and that of the particle responsible for the photon scattering, respectively, and zg the gravitational redshift (∼ 0.3 for standard NS mass and radius).
In our analysis, the absorption feature in the spectrum of
J1605 is found at a nominal energy of 0.432 − 0.451 keV
(depending on the best-fit model, see Table 2). Assuming
canonical values for the NS mass and radius (M = 1.4 M⊙
and R = 10 km) and an average value of the absorption line
of 0.44 keV, the resulting magnetic field is 9.0 × 1013 and
4.9×1010 G for the proton and electron features, respectively.
Timing studies point out that all other pulsating XINS harbor a magnetic field of the order of 1013 G, an order of mag7 This value of the color factor is obtained by Zavlin et al. (1996) for

hydrogen) of the NSA model considered here (see Figure 5 of their work).

nitude that is consistent with the results from our fit of the
atmospheric model and that inferred by the pCF (see Table 2
and Section 4.3). Moreover, we notice that in the case of pCF,
the feature is expected to be narrower, with line widths of
the order of hundreds of eV (Nishimura 2003, and references
therein), contrary to widths of the order of keV for eCRSF,
although line strength suppression by vacuum polarization in
high magnetic fields plays a role in both features (see, e.g.,
Ho & Lai 2003). We observe a line width of ∼ 110 eV, in
agreement with expectations for a pCF and comparable to
the width of Gaussian absorption lines in other XINS whose
independent measurements of the magnetic field favor the
pCF interpretation (see, e.g., Cropper et al. 2004). Therefore, if the origin of the absorption feature is to be ascribed
to cyclotron resonance, our analysis tends to favor the proton rather than the electron as the particle responsible for the
scattering/absorption process.
Previous work claimed other absorption features in the
spectrum of J1605 that have not been detected in the present
work (Haberl 2007; Pires et al. 2014). These features had
centroid energies with a 2:3:4 ratio, and were therefore interpreted as the result of harmonic cyclotron features. In Section 3.2 we gave technical reasons that might explain the different results presented in this work. Here we point out a further physical reason that highlights the difficulty to observe
proton harmonic cyclotron resonant features in the spectra
of highly-magnetic, thermally-emitting INSs. In fact, in such
physical conditions the strength of each pCF harmonic would
scale with the feature centroid energy E as ∼ E/mx c2 with
respect to the fundamental (where mx is the mass of the particle responsible for the scattering). Accordingly, pCFs would
result in progressively weaker lines (van Kerkwijk & Kaplan
2007; Schwope et al. 2007; Potekhin 2010), contrary to the
observations. However, we note that quantum effects can
make electron cyclotron harmonics stronger than the simple ∼ E/mx c2 scaling (Suleimanov et al. 2010, 2012), and
therefore make them possible to be observed. Furthermore,
Pires et al. (2019) also found no evidence of the previously
reported absorption features.
Finally, as noted by Viganò et al. (2014), surface temperature inhomogeneities can mimic absorption lines, at least
in the spectra of some XINS. Those authors find that a pure
blackbody model can result in a spurious absorption feature
at ∼ 0.45 keV which, instead, can be accounted for by a synthetic model composed of several surface temperature distributions. However, the employment of a double-blackbody
model should ensure our analysis to be free from spurious detections at ∼ 0.45 keV because this energy value lies close to
the Wien peak of one of the blackbody components, thus enhancing the robustness of our results. Nonetheless, a doubleblackbody model also can result in spurious absorption features around the energy where the flux from the cold and hot

NICER AND XMM

components is comparable. For J1605, our analysis reveals
that comparable flux contributions in the double-blackbody
model are found between 0.7 − 0.8 keV (see Figure 1), consistent with the centroid energy of the broad absorption line
reported in previous works on J1605 (see Section 1). Therefore, we conclude that the claimed broad absorption line at
∼ 0.8 keV in J1605 is most likely model-dependent.
4.5. An atmospheric origin for the absorption feature
An alternative explanation for the absorption features observed among XINS spectra considers atomic transitions
in a hydrogen atmosphere (Lai 2001; Medin & Lai 2006;
van Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2007; Medin et al. 2008; Potekhin
2014). Absorption features resulting from magnetized atmospheres have been considered in, e.g., Sanwal et al. (2002);
van Kerkwijk et al. (2004); Suleimanov et al. (2012). With
a gravitational redshift of zg = 0.3 (see Section 4.3), and
for a mean value of the absorption feature of 0.44 keV, the
unredshifted energy of the feature goes up to 0.57 keV. Considering a partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere (see Section 4.3), such a value does not correspond to expected
energies except possibly a transition from ground state to
first excited tightly bound state (ν = 0, s = 0 → 1, where
ν, s are the principal and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively) and only if B > 1013 G (see e.g., Lai 2001;
Medin & Lai 2006; van Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2007; Ho et al.
2008). Such a high magnetic field is also required for the
observed feature to be associated with spectral features due
to a condensed surface spectrum (see e.g., Potekhin et al.
2012; Hambaryan et al. 2017). However, for a magnetic field
strength as high as that implied by the pCF (9.0 × 1013 G,
see Section 4.4), absorption features may be washed out due
to the vacuum resonance mode conversion (Lai & Ho 2003;
Ho & Lai 2003; Potekhin et al. 2004; van Adelsberg & Lai
2006; van Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2007; Potekhin et al. 2012;
Potekhin 2014).
Even though our best-fit atmosphere models are composed
of hydrogen, we notice that in Medin et al. (2008) there is an
expected bound-free transition at 564.9 eV in a helium atmosphere with a magnetic field of 1013 G. This energy is consistent with the unredshifted feature’s nominal energy found by
the best-fit double-blackbody model, that is 0.565 keV.
4.6. Lack of pulsations
A periodic X-ray signal associated with the rotation period of J1605 remains undetected. Non-detection of pulsation for this source is also reported by Pires et al. (2019).
The upper limit on the pulsed fraction of ∼1.3% we have
derived is comparable to the very low modulation fraction
of 1.2% observed for another XINS, RX J1856.5−3754
(Tiengo & Mereghetti 2007). Such a low level of pulsations indicates that the variations of the apparent thermal

RX J1605.3+3249

11

flux caused by the changing view of the surface of the neutron star as it rotates are modest. This could be a consequence of a close alignment between the observer’s line of
sight and the spin axis of the NS. However, for the case of
double-blackbody emission, Pires et al. (2019) argue that the
likelihood that we do not see pulsations from the source due
to the particularly unfavorable viewing geometry is small,
∼2%.
Moreover, or alternatively, the temperature contrast across
the stellar surface may be low, or the heat distribution may
be approximately symmetric about the rotation axis, which
when combined with relativistic light bending (which acts to
suppress the amplitude of thermal pulsations) can result in
a low pulsed fraction. At least in the case of the doubleblackbody model (see Section 4.1), the temperature contrast
between the hot spot and the cooling NS is large, favoring the
symmetrical heat distribution interpretation.
On the other hand, the fit of atmospheric models hints to
a uniform temperature across the entire surface of the NS
(see Section 4.3), which would lead to isotropic emission,
thus to the observed lack of pulsation. Although the above
represents a tempting scenario, we note that an inhomogeneous temperature distribution is expected across the NS surface due to the presence of strong magnetic fields (see Ho
2007; Page et al. 2007; Pons et al. 2009; Hambaryan et al.
2017, and present work). Nonetheless, other theoretical
works (e.g., Potekhin et al. 2003; Kaminker et al. 2006) do
not expect strong deviations of the temperature distribution
from spherical symmetry, even in the case of strong magnetic fields, e.g., if a “patched” multipole geometry of the
magnetic field is present (see Pérez-Azorín et al. 2006).
5. SUMMARY

We have performed X-ray spectral and timing analyses
of the XINS RX J1605.3+3249 observed with NICER and
XMM. Our main results can be summarized as follows:
• In agreement with Pires et al. (2019), we found no
evidence of pulsation for J1605 with pulsed fraction
greater than 1.3% (3σ) for periods above 0.15 s. With
NICER, we find no pulsations with pulsed fraction
greater than 2.6% for periods above 2 ms. As such,
J1605 remains the only XINS member that exhibits no
pulsation. This may be due to either geometrical effects or to isotropic atmospheric emission.
• The X-ray spectrum of J1605 is equally well fitted
by a double-blackbody model and by two magnetic
atmospheric models: the NSA/NSA-like model and
the NSMAXG model. Double-blackbody and NSA-like
models predict consistent flux values at optical wavelengths. The former also fits optical archival data. A

12

M ALACARIA
color-corrected version of the NSA model also fits the
optical data.
• Those models that fit optical data show a UV excess
that, if due to absorption by material surrounding the
NS, would require a column density of a few times
1021 cm−2 . However IR archival data are difficult to
reconcile with this scenario. If the best-fit doubleblackbody model with Galactic NH is considered, UV
data are also well fitted, while optical data can be accounted as blackbody emission at kTeff = 1 keV from
a fallback disk.
• The X-ray spectrum of J1605 shows an absorption feature at ∼ 0.44 keV, consistent with prior analyses but
without the harmonically related features previously
claimed. Our analysis favors the interpretation of this
feature as a proton cyclotron resonant feature, implying a magnetic field strength of 9 × 1013 G. Contribution to this feature may come from atomic hydrogen transition from the ground state to the first excited
tightly bound state.

The lack of a well established value of the distance to
J1605 prevents us from inferring additional physical characteristics of this source. It is therefore of key importance

to perform further observations in order to measure J1605’s
distance conclusively.
