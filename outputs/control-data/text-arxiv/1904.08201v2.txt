Abstract
We introduce a new approach to find the Tomita-Takesaki modular flow for
multi-component regions in general chiral conformal field theory. Our method is
based on locality and analyticity of primary fields as well as the so-called KuboMartin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. These features can be used to transform the
problem to a Riemann-Hilbert problem on a covering of the complex plane cut along
the regions, which is equivalent to an integral equation for the matrix elements of
the modular Hamiltonian. Examples are considered.

Introduction

The reduced density matrix of a subsystem induces an intrinsic internal dynamics called
the “modular flow”. The flow is non-trivial only for non-commuting observable algebras
– i.e., in quantum theory – and depends on both the subsystem and the given state
of the total system. It has been subject to much attention in theoretical physics in
recent times because it is closely related to information theoretic concepts. As examples
for some topics such as Bekenstein bounds, Quantum Focussing Conjecture, c-theorems,
holography we mention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In mathematics, the modular flow has played an
important role in the study of operator algebras through the work of Connes, Takesaki
and others, see [6] for an encyclopedic account.
It has been known almost from the beginning that the modular flow has a geometric
nature in local quantum field theory when the subsystem is defined by a spacetime region
of a simple shape such as an interval in chiral conformal field theory (CFT) [7, 8, 9]: it
is the 1-parameter group of Möbius transformations leaving the interval fixed. For more
complicated regions, important progress was made only much later in a pioneering work
by Casini et al. [10], who were able to determine the flow for multi-component regions

for a chiral half of free massless fermions in two dimensions. Recently in [11] they have
generalized their method to the conformal theory of a chiral Up1q-current. Unfortunately,
the method by [10, 11], as well as all other concrete methods known to the author, is based
in an essential way on special properties of free quantum field theories. The purpose of
this paper is to develop methods that could give a handle on the problem in general chiral
CFTs, i.e. the left-moving half of a CFT on a (compactified) lightray in 1+1 dimensional
Minkowski spacetime, and to make some of the constructions in the literature rigorous
by our alternative method.
Consider a (possibly mixed) state in the chiral CFT, described by a density matrix
ρ. Typical states of interest are the vacuum ρ “ |Ω0 yxΩ0 |, or a thermal state ρ “
e´βL0 { Tr e´βL0 . Given a union A “ Yj paj , bj q of intervals of the (compactified) lightray,
we can consider its reduced density matrix TrA1 ρ “ ρA , where A1 is the complement of A.
For the purposes of this discussion, we restrict to the vacuum state, although in the main
part, thermal states will play a major role as well. If φpxq is a primary field localized
at x P A, the “modular flow” is the Heisenberg time evolution ρitA φpxqρ´it
A . The object
ρA is not actually well-defined in quantum field theory, but the modular flow is. Below
we will use the rigorous framework of Tomita-Takesaki theory in our construction, but
for pedagogical purposes, we here pretend that ρA exists. Formally, the Hilbert space H
splits as HA b HA1 and if ρ is pure, then ρA is formally a density matrix on HA . Its –
equally formal – logarithm HA “ ln ρA is called the modular Hamiltonian in the physics
literature.
In mathematical terms, the quantity which is well defined is the operator ∆ “ ρA bρ´1
A1 .

For x P A, we can then also write ρA φpxqρA “ ∆ φpxq∆ and ln ∆ “ HA b 1A1 ´ 1A b
HA1 . Furthermore, one can write
1´it
TrpφpxqρitA φpyqρA
q “ xΩ0 |φpxq∆it φpyqΩ0 y.

(1)

and since the conformal primaries generate the full Hilbert space (mathematically, the
Reeh-Schlieder theorem), we see that we knowledge of this quantity for all primaries φ
suffices, in principle, to determine all matrix elements of ∆it , hence the operator itself,
hence the flow. Alternatively, to know the generator of the flow, it suffices to know
xΩ0 |φpxqpln ∆qφpyqΩ0 y. It is those types of quantities which we will study in this paper.
Our main trick is the following observation and it variants. For s ą 0 and fixed y P A,
define a function of x on the complex plane cut along the intervals A,
#
xΩ0 |φpxqr1 ´ es p1 ´ ∆q´1 s´1 φpyqΩ0 y
if ℑpxq ă 0,
F ps, x, yq “
(2)
xΩ0 |φpyqr1 ´ es p1 ´ ∆´1 q´1 s´1 φpxqΩ0 y if ℑpxq ą 0.
Then not only do the usual properties of CFTs imply that this function is holomorphic
on the mutliply cut plane, but we also know its jumps across the cuts, given by the
functional equation
p1 ´ es qF ps, x ´ i0, yq ´ F ps, x ` i0, yq “ xΩ0 |rφpxq, φpyqsΩ0y.

(3)

The commutator on the right side is given by a sum of δ-functions and their derivatives
by locality. We also prove certain further general properties of this function such as
the degree of divergences as x approaches y or any boundary of a cut which depend on
2

the conformal dimension of φ. Using this functional equation and a standard contour
argument appearing frequently in the study of Riemann-Hilbert type problems, we then
obtain a linear integral equation for F of Cauchy-type, see cor. 2 (in the case of bosonic
fields). The desired matrix elements of the modular Hamiltonian are related by the
integral

ds F ps, x, yq.

(4)

A variant of this method also works for fermionic fields and for thermal states where
the corresponding function F lives on a torus cut along A and satisfies a corresponding
integral equation, see cor. 1.
The basis of our method is in some sense an old trick in quantum statistical mechanics.
Consider a statistical operator ρ. The expectation functional acting an observable X
is ωpXq “ TrpXρq and the modular flow acting on an observable X is, by definition,
σ t pXq “ ρit Xρ´it . For observables X, Y , consider the function ϕX,Y ptq “ ωpXσ tpY qq “
TrpXρit Y ρ1´it q. Since ρ is a positive operator, one expects this function to be analytic
inside the strip tt P C| ´ 1 ă ℑptq ă 0u. The values at the two boundaries of the strip
are evidently related by the functional equation
ϕX,Y pt ´ iq “ ϕY,X p´tq.

(5)

This functional equation is called the “KMS-condition.” Its fundamental importance was
first understood in [12].
Note that on the right side, X, Y appear in opposite order. Thus, if we have information about their commutator, we can sometimes get a closed equation for ϕX,Y ptq or
related quantities. This is for ř
instance the case for the ideal quantum Bose or Fermi
´1 ´βH
gas, where ρ “ Z e
, H “ Ek a˚k ak , the modular flow is just the Heisenberg time
evolution with ‘time’ parameter ´βt, and where one takes Y “ ak , X “ a˚p . Using the
commutators and ϕp,k ptq “ e´itβEk ϕp,k p0q, the KMS condition is thereby equivalent in
the case of bosons to the condition
p1 ´ e´βEk qϕp,k p0q “ e´βEk δ 3 pk ´ pq.

(6)

In this way, one can easily derive the standard Bose-Einstein (or Fermi-Dirac-) formula
for the 2-point function. In our problem, these ideas are modified and applied to the
reduced density matrix ρA of a CFT.
This paper is organized as follows. In secs. 2, 3, we review basic notions from
operator algebras, Tomita-Takesaki theory, and the operator algebraic approach to CFT
(conformal nets) in order to make the paper self-contained. In secs. 4, 5 we introduce
our method and study several examples. We conclude in sec. 6. Some conventions for
elliptic functions are described in the appendix.

Review of modular theory

2.1

Modular flow

For the convenience of the unfamiliar reader we review the basic elements of modular
(“ Tomita-Takesaki-) theory; detailed references are [6, 13]. Connections to quantum
information theory are described in [14]. An exposition directed towards a theoretical
physics audience is [15].
The notion of modular flow is embedded into the theory of v. Neumann algebras.
Such an algebra, M, can be defined as a complex linear space of bounded operators on
some Hilbert space1 H that is closed under taking products, adjoints (denoted by ˚).
Such limits are understood in the so called “weak” topology, i.e. convergence of matrix
elements. It is common to denote by M1 the commutant, defined as the set of all bounded
operators on H commuting with all operators in M.
To define the objects of main interest of the theory, one has to assume that M is in
“standard form”, meaing: H contains a “cyclic and separating” vector for M, that is, a unit
vector |Ωy such that the set consisting of X|Ωy, X P M is a dense subspace of H, and such
that X|Ωy “ 0 implies X “ 0 for any X P M. The point is that one can then consistently
define the anti-linear Tomita operator S on the domain DpSq “ tX|Ωy | X P Mu by the
formula
SX|Ωy “ X ˚ |Ωy.
(7)
The cyclic property is needed in order that S is densely defined, whereas without the
separating property the definition would not be self-consistent. One can show that S is a
closable operator. This technical property guarantees that S has a polar decomposition.
1
It is customarily denoted by S “ J∆ 2 , where J anti-linear and unitary and ∆ self-adjoint
and non-negative. Tomita-Takesaki theory is about the interplay between the operators
∆, J and the algebras M, M1. The basic theorem is:
(i) J exchanges M with the commutant in the sense that JMJ “ M1 . Furthermore,
J 2 “ 1, J∆J “ ∆´1 .
(ii) The modular flow σ t pXq “ ∆it X∆´it leaves M and M1 invariant for all t P R.
(iii) From the vector |Ωy, one can define the state functional ωpXq “ xΩ|XΩy, ω :
M Ñ C. It is positive and normalized (meaning ωpX ˚Xq ě 0 @X P M, ωp1q “ 1),
and invariant under the modular flow in the sense that ω ˝ σ t “ ω for all t P R. The
KMS-condition holds: for all X, Y P M, the bounded function
t ÞÑ ϕX,Y ptq “ ωpXσ t pY qq ” xΩ|X∆it Y Ωy

We always assume that H is separable.

has an analytic continuation to the strip tz P C | ´1 ă ℑz ă 0u with the property
that its boundary value for ℑz Ñ ´1` exists and is equal to
ϕX,Y pt ´ iq “ ωpσ t pY qXq.

(9)

A partial converse to (iii) is: If ω 1 is a normal (i.e. continuous in the weak˚ -topology)
positive linear functional on M, then it has a unique vector representative |Ω1 y in the
natural cone P 7 :“ tXjpXq|Ωy | X P Mu, where jpXq “ JXJ; in other words ω 1 pXq “
xΩ1 |XΩ1 y for all X P M.
The objects J, ∆, P 7 depend on the algebra M and the state |Ωy.
Example 0: Even tough Tomita-Takesaki theory is most interesting in the case of infinite
dimensional v. Neumann algebras of types II, III, it helps with intuition to have in
mind the finite dimensional case, i.e. the type In ’ (algebra of n by n matrices). In this
case, M “ Mn pCq b 1n , which acts on the Hilbert space H “ Cn b Cn . Evidently, the
1
commutant

if |Ωy “ j“1 pj |jy b |jy in some ON basis t|jyu and iff all pj ą 0, nj“1 pj “ 1. The
state functional ω can be written in this example in terms of the “reduced density matrix”

(10)

In fact, any positive normalized state functional ω 1 arises from a unique reduced density
matrix ρω1 in this way. It is easy to go through the definition of ∆, J via S giving for
instance that

∆ 2 “ ρω2 b ρω 2 .
(11)

Therefore, the modular flow is σ t pXq “ ρitω Xρω´it . The “modular Hamiltonian” is defined
as the self-adjoint operator ln ∆. In our example, therefore, ln ∆ “ ln ρω b 1n ´ 1n b ln ρω ,
where the first term belongs to M and the second to M1 . It is important to stress that the
split of ln ∆ into a part from M and one from M1 is impossible for general v. Neumann
algebras, in particular for the type III1 -factors appearing in quantum field theories2 .
Therefore, apart from trivial cases, the object ln ρω , hence the reduced density operator
ρω itself, does not exist. On the other and, ln ∆ and ω always exist. We will make sure
to work with these well-defined objects in our setting.
Sometimes, a state ω is only given as an abstract (weakly continuous) expectation
functional on an abstract3 v. Neumann algebra M. Then one can perform the basic but
very important GNS construction in order to obtain a Hilbert space in which the state
is represented by a vector.
The starting point of this construction is the simple observation that the algebra
M itself, as a linear space, always forms a representation π by left multiplication, i.e.
πpXqY ” XY . To equip this representation with a Hilbert space structure, it is natural
2
The possibility of making the split implies that σ t is inner, i.e. can be written as σ t pXq “ U ptqXU ptq˚
for unitaries U ptq in M. One characterization of type III v. Neumann algebras is that σ t precisely cannot
be inner for any normal state ω.

We mean a C ˚ -algebra with a preferred “folium” of normal states, see [6]. In particular, it is not
assumed that M is a priori represented by bounded linear operators on some Hilbert space.

to define xX|Y y “ ωpX ˚Y q, but this will in general lead to non-zero vectors with vanishing
norm, unless ω is separating. Introduce Jω “ tX P M | ωpX ˚Xq “ 0u. By the CauchySchwarz inequality, |ωpX ˚Y q| ď ωpX ˚Xq1{2 ωpY ˚ Y q1{2 , we have Jω “ tX P M | @Y P
M, ωpY ˚ Xq “ 0u, so it is a closed linear subspace and a left ideal of M containing precisely
the null vectors. We can then define Hω “ M{Jω and complete it in the induced inner
product. The left representation induces a representation on Hω which is called πω . It
is the desired GNS-representation. The vector |Ωω y P Hω representing ω is simply the
equivalence class of the unit operator, 1. It is by construction “cyclic” in the sense that
the set πω pMq|Ωω y is dense in Hω . The vector is standard if ωpX ˚ Xq implies X “ 0
(meaning Jω “ t0u), in which case we say that it is faithful.

Review of chiral CFTs
Conformal nets on the real line (lightray)

One way to formalize the structure of chiral conformal quantum field theories (CFTs)
is via nets of operator algebras. A chiral conformal field theory is associated with one
lightray. It is given abstractly by an assignment of an algebra of operators ApIq with
each open interval I “ pa, bq Ă R of the this lightray.
This assignment is called a conformal net if it obeys the following rules (see [18] for
a general introdution to algebraic quantum field theory and e.g. [19, 20] for conformal
nets):
a1) (Isotony) The algebras ApIq are v. Neumann algebras acting on a common Hilbert
space H. If I Ă J are intervals, then ApIq Ă ApJq.
a2) (Causality) Setting I 1 “ Rzra, bs if I “ pa, bq, we have ApI 1 q Ă ApIq1 , i.e. observables
from disjoint intervals commute.
a3) (Covariance) On H, there is a unitaryˆrepresentation
g ÞÑ Upgq of the group
˙

SLp2, Rq{t˘1u. If we let elements g “
of this group act locally on R by

a4) (Spectrum) The representation g ÞÑ Upgq is strongly continuous. The infinitesimal

generator P of translations trat pxq “ x ` t, i.e. P “ ´i dt

a5) (Vacuum) There is a unique (unit) vector |Ω0 y P H such that Upgq|Ω0 y “ |Ω0 y.
The corresponding state functional
Žwill be called ω0 pXq “ xΩ0 |XΩ0 y throughout.
The vacuum should be cyclic for I ApIq, the v. Neumann algebra generated by
all intervals.

Conformal nets on the circle (compactified lightray)

If we want to insist on a global action of the Möbuis group SLp2, Rq{t˘1u on the net, we
must pass from the light ray to a compactified lightray, i.e. the circle. The compactification proceeds via the Caley transformation C : Szt`1u Ñ R, Cpxq “ ´ipx`1q{px´1q, and
under this transformation intervals get mapped to arcs of the circle. The Caley transform
intertwines the action of SLp2, Rq{t˘1u on the lightray with the action z ÞÑ gpzq “ αz`β

of SUp1, 1q{t˘1u on the circle, where g now corresponds to the matrix
P SUp1, 1q
β̄ ᾱ
under the standard isomorphism between the groups SLp2, Rq and SUp1, 1q.
The axioms for a conformal field theory, i.e. net of operator algebras, on the circle are
completely analogous to those for the lightray. In the circle picture, it is more standard
and natural to use the generators of SUp1, 1q called L0 , L˘1 , where L0 is the generator
of rotations z Ñ eit z, t P R. The requirement a4) is equivalent to the requirement
that L0 has non-negative spectrum. From a net on the circle, we may via the Caley
transform always get a net on the lightray such that P has non-negative spectrum, but
not necessarily vice versa since the point at infinity is missing from the lightray. For the
rest of the paper, we will assume the axioms on the circle. In sec. 5, we will also need:
a6) (Finite trace) Tr e´βL0 ă 8 for β ą 0.
The above axioms (including the trace condition just mentioned) have a number of
well-known consequences which are of interest for this paper:
1. For each interval ApIq1 “ ApI 1 q (Haag duality [9]).
2. For each interval, the linear subspace ApIq|Ω0 y is dense in H (Reeh-Schlieder theorem). As a consequence, the vector |Ω0 y is cyclic and separating for each local
algebra ApIq, and we can apply Tomita-Takesaki theory to the pair pApIq, |Ω0 yq.
3. The modular operator ∆ associated with an open arc I “ pa, bq acts geometrically
in the sense that
∆it “ Upgt q,

5. I ApIq “ BpHq (irreducibility [23]).

Most of these axioms and results have a more or less obvious counterpart for graded
local, i.e. “fermionic”, theories, see e.g. [24].

tLn , κunPZ obeying

rLn , Lm s “ pn ´ mqLn`m ` npn2 ´ 1qδn,´m , rLn , κs “ 0.
12
A positive energy representation on a Hilbert space H is a representation such that (i)
L˚n “ L´n (unitarity), (ii) L0 is diagonalizable with non-negative eigenvalues, and (iii)
the central element is represented by κ “ c1. From now, we assume a positive energy
representation. We assume that H contains a vacuum vector |Ω0 y which is annihilated
by L´1 , L0 , L1 , (slp2, Rq-invariance) and which is a highest weight vector (of weight 0),
i.e. Ln |Ω0 y “ 0 for all n ą 0. One has the bound [20, 25, 26, 27]

for |Ψy P V ” kě0 DpLk0 q Ă H and any natural number k.
One next defines from the Virasoro algebra the stress tensor on the unit circle S,
identified with points z “ e2πiu , u P R in C. The stress tensor is an operator valued

can be shown to be a common core for the operators T pf q) and the assignment f ÞÑ

Letting Γ be the anti-linear involution
Γf pzq “ ´z 2 f pzq,

(20)

the smeared stress tensor is a self-adjoint operator on DpL0 q for f obeying the reality
condition Γf “ f , and one has T pf q˚ “ T pΓf q in general. It can be shown that the
operators eiT pf q for real f form a unitary projective representation of the (covering of
the) group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms (whose generators are the vector
fields f pzqd{dz) on the circle. The Virasoro net is then defined by
AVir pIq “ teiT pf q | f P C 8 pIq, Γf “ f u2

(21)

where the double prime means the v. Neumann closure. The generators of this algebra
hence correspond to diffeomorphisms acting trivially outside the arc I Ă S.

Pointlike fields

The standard setup of CFT commonly used in the physics literature is based on the use of
pointlike fields rather than nets of algebras of bounded operators. Here we will sketch the
connection. In fact, the full mathematical details of this connection are not understood
in general, although in many important classes of examples, see [20].
On the circle, one typically postulates the existence of local fields having the “mode
expansions”
1 ÿ
φn z ´n´h .
(22)
φpzq “ ?
2π nPZ

h ą 0 is called the conformal dimension of the field. The field is typically “energy
bounded” i.e. that the modes φn , n P Z of the field are linear operators on H0 , which
satisfy:
Assumption 1. The local fields have a mode expansion (22) such that:
1

1. an energy bound of the type }p1 ` L0 qk φn Ψ} ď Cp1 ` |n|qk`h´ 2 }p1 ` L0 qk`h´1Ψ} for
all n P N0 , |Ψy P H0 , and for some k ě 0, satisfying
2. the commutation relations rLm , φn s “ pph ´ 1qm ´ nqφn`m for |m| ď 1 where
L´1 , L0 , L1 are the generators of the action of SUp1, 1q on H0 and where h P R
is called the conformal spin, satisfying
3. if |Ω0 y P H0 is the vacuum vector, then φn |Ω0 y “ 0 for n ą ´h, and satisfying
4. φ˚n “ φ´n for a self-adjoint local field.
5. The fields φpf q, supppf q Ă I should be affiliated with ApIq, i.e. there exists a
sequence Bn such that limn Bn |Ψy “ φpf q|Ψy for all Ψ P V “ Xk DpLk0 q.
These properties imply that the smeared fields are operator valued tempered distributions
on the domain V “ Xk DpLk0 q: Let |Ψy P V. Then 1) gives, with φpf q :“

because |fp´n´h | goes to zero for |n| Ñ 8 faster than any inverse power. Thus, φpf q
is an operator valued distribution on the dense invariant domain V, which is in fact a
common core for the operators φpf q. By the same type of estimate the properties 1) and 2)
imply furthermore that φpzq|Ω0 y can be analytically continued to a H-valued holomorphic
function on D` with vector valued distributional boundary value on S. It follows from
the commutation relations 2) that H carries a strongly continuous unitary representation
U of SUp1, 1q generated by L0 , L˘1 , and this representation satisfies transformation law

Č1q is in the covering group of the Möbius group, and gpzq its action on

points z of the circle. For integer h P N0 , we get a representation of SUp1, 1q{t˘1u. The
9

restriction of U to the invariant subspace spantφn |Ω0 y “ 0 | n ď ´hu is a discrete series
representation (see e.g. IX, para. 3 of [28]). It also follows that primary fields can and
will be normalized so that

(25)

In particular, we see that the field can be local only if the dimension h is a natural
number. Fermionic fields are not local but satisfy a graded locality. In that case h P 12 N0 .

Example 5: (Stress tensor) The stress tensor T pzq affiliated with the Virasoro net
of central charge c ą 0 is a pointlike field of dimension h “ 2 satisfying the above
assumptions.

Example 6: (Up1q-current, see e.g. [25, 24]) The net of the free Up1q current on the
circle can be defined e.g. starting from the Lie-algebra generated by a central element 1
and the “modes” jn , n P Z defined by rjn , jm s “ inδn,´m 1 with *-operation jn˚ “ j´n . The
Hilbert space H is the closure of the linear span of jn1 . . . jnk |Ω0 y, n1 ď ¨ ¨ ¨ ď nk ď ´1 on

Modular operators for conformal nets on S

In this section we give a first prescription for computing modular operators of chiral conformal nets on S satisfying some natural extra conditions. It is related naturally to the
matrix elements xΩ0 |φpxq∆it φpyq|Ω0 y, but leaves in general certain ambiguities that preclude so far their explicit calculation. This difficulty can be overcome to a certain extent
by our second method, presented in sec. 5, more directly related to the matrix element
xΩ|φpxqpln ∆qφpyq|Ωy. Since the material here will form the basis of our discussion in sec.
5, and since the arguments are also of independent interest, we nevertheless present this
approach first.

4.1

General results

Quite generally, if M is a v. Neumann algebra in standard form with cyclic and separating
vector Ω, then if X, Y P M, the Fourier transform
ż
dt
ΓX,Y psq ” xΩ|X∆it Y Ωy eits
(34)
2π
R
11

is well-defined in the sense of a tempered distribution in the variable s – in fact for
Y “ X ˚ , ΓX,X ˚ psqds is a positive Radon measure on R, see sec. 5.3 of [13]. By the
Fourier inversion theorem, the operator ∆it is hence fully characterized provided we know
ΓX,Y psq for all X, Y P M and all s, i.e. as a distribution in s.
Using the KMS condition (9) after shifting the integration contour from the real axis
R to the line R ´ i parallel to the real axis immediately gives
ΓX,Y psq “ es ΓY,X p´sq.

(35)

ΓX,Y psq “ ΓY,X p´sq

(36)

On the other hand, for X P M, Y P M1 or vice versa, we get
using that the modular flow σ t pXq “ ∆it X∆´it preserves M, M1.
We now want to describe how the extra structure of chiral conformal field theory can
help to characterize ΓX,Y psq. The case we want to consider is the v. Neumann algebra
M “ ApAq, associated with a region A consisting of p open arcs. The vector under
consideration is the vacuum, |Ωy “ |Ω0 y. It seems that the information is most easily
retrieved if instead of bounded operators X, Y , we work with point-like unbounded field
operators as described in the previous section. We define for a generic primary field φ:
ż
dt
(37)
Γps; x, yq ” xΩ0 |φpxq∆it φpyq|Ω0 y eits .
2π
R

Here, x, y P S are to be smeared with test functions on A or A1 , and ∆ ” ∆A is the
modular operator in the vacuum state for the multi-interval/arc A. The quantity Γ
should be considered as analogous to (34).
Example 8: For one arc, A “ pa, bq, the modular flow of a local primary field of
dimension h is given by the Hislop-Longo theorem [8, 9] as
∆it φpxq∆´it “ rgt1 pxqsh φpgt pxqq,

gt pxq “

Therefore Γ can be found from (37) and (25), giving for x, y P pa, bq

The example suggests that the behavior of Γps, x, yq near a boundary point qi of a
multi-interval could be px ´ qi q´h . This is supported by the following lemma, formulated
in the circle picture.
Lemma 1. Under the assumptions on the CFT given in the previous subsections:
ş
1. If f P C08 pRq and Γpf ; x, yq ” Γps; x, yqf psqds, then Gpf ; x, yq is smooth in x, y P
S away from the 2p end-points of the p intervals Ij . Moreover, for any 0 ă ε ď 21 ,

for some constant C only depending on the end-points. Here, σ “ `1 if both x, y
are in A, σ “ ´1 if x, y are in A1 “ SzĀ.
2. We have the KMS condition
Γps; x, yq “ es Γp´s; y, xq

(41)

in the sense of distributions for x, y P A. When x P A, y P A1 (or vice versa), we
have instead
Γps; x, yq “ Γp´s; y, xq.
(42)
Proof. 1) We will compare the quantity Γ of an arbitrary multi-arc A to that corresponding to a single arc. First we assume x, y P A. Let I be the largest arc contained in A
that is symmetric around x, and J the largest interval contained in A symmetric around
2
y. If, for example, cj resp. ck are to the left of x resp. y, then I “ pcj , c´1
j x q resp.
2
J “ pck , c´1
k y q. We let ∆A , ∆J , ∆I be the modular operators for the corresponding local
algebras. Then we use the well-known operator inequality ∆αI ě ∆αA for 0 ď α ď 1. This
follows from the fact that ApAq Ą ApIq, which is exploited as follows. Quite generally,
let Mi be two v. Neumann algebras on the same Hilbert space with common cyclic and
separating vector |Ωy. We let Si be the Tomita operators for Mi with polar decompo1{2
sitions Si “ Ji ∆i . Note that, if M2 Ă M1 , then DpS2 q Ă DpS1q. The set DpS1 q is a
Hilbert space called H1 with respect to the inner product (graph norm)
pΦ, Ψq “ xΦ|Ψy ` eu xS1 Ψ|S1 Φy “ xΦ|p1 ` eu ∆1 qΨy.

(43)

Letting I : H1 Ñ DpS1 q be the identification map, one shows that I ´1 DpS2 q is a closed
subspace H2 Ă H1 with associated orthogonal projection P2 . The operators Vj “ I ´1 p1 `
eu ∆j q´1{2 are isometries from H to Hj (j “ 1, 2) and their adjoints are Vj˚ “ p1 `
eu ∆j q1{2 IPj (with P1 “ 1). There follow the relations

which can already be found in [21].
We multiply the first relation from the right with X P M2 and from the left with
Y ˚ P M2 and take the expectation value in the state |Ωy. Then we use the second
equation and obtain
xΩ|Y ˚ p1 ` eu ∆1 q´1 X|Ωy ´ xΩ|Y ˚ p1 ` eu ∆2 q´1 X|Ωy

(46)

The fact that the right side is manifestly non-negative for X “ Y implies p1 ` eu ∆2 q´1 ď

Since φpxq|Ω0 y can be analytically continued to a H0 -valued holomorphic function inside
the unit disk D` (by the mode expansion of φ, see the previous subsection), the HislopLongo theorem applied to the modular flow σIt of I can similarly be continued to imaginary

Now we split the testfunction f “ f` ` f´ , where the testfunction f´ has support in
p´8, cs, and the testfunction f` has support in r´c, 8q. Then, for the contribution from
f´ , we choose α “ 1 ´ ε, whereas for the contribution from f` , we choose α “ ε. As a
consequence, we find that (40) holds.
This shows in particular boundedness in x, y of Γpf, x, yq away from the endpoints.
A similar estimation can be made for descendant fields, i.e. the derivatives of the fields
φpxq, φpyq, and this shows smoothness. This finishes the proof of 1) when x, y P A.
To cover the other case, we note that the modular operator for ApAq1 Ą ApA1 q is
related to that of M1 by ∆11 “ ∆´1
1 . Then the other case of 1) follow by the same
argument, namely, x, y P A1 we take I 1 be the largest interval contained in A1 that is
symmetric around x, and J 1 the largest interval contained in A1 symmetric around y and
proceed in the same way as before.
14

2) Eq. (41) follows from the KMS condition (9) for bounded operators X, Y P
π0 pApAqq2 because we are assuming about the local fields that for test-functions f, g supported in A there exist Xn , Yn P π0 pApAqq2 with the property that limn Xn |Ω0 y “ φpf q|Ω0 y
and limn Yn |Ω0 y “ φpgq|Ω0 y in the strong topology. A similar remark applies to (42).
We next make analytic continuations in the variables x, y. This gives us the following:
For fixed x P A, and fixed test-function f psq, the function y ÞÑ Γpf ; x, yq has an analytic
extension to a holomorphic function of y inside the unit disk D` “ tz P C | |z| ă 1u, by
the mode expansion of φ. Similarly, for fixed y P A, the function x ÞÑ Γps; x, yq has an
analytic extension to x outside the unit disk D´ “ tz P C | |z| ą 1u. How to extend to
y P D´ or x P D` ? The idea is that Γpf, y, xq is analytic in this domain, so we try to
paste Γps; x, yq and Γpf, y, xq together across the boundary of the disk and hope that we
get an analytic function that way. This will turn out to be the case on account of the
KMS condition which relates the two quantities in precisely the right way.
To this end, we define the following auxiliary quantity for fixed x P A, s P R:
#
Γp`s, x, yq if y P D` ,
Kpyq ”
(52)
Γp´s, y, xq if y P D´ .
We similarly define, for fixed y P A, s P R:
#
Γp`s, x, yq if x P D´ ,
Hpxq ”
Γp´s, y, xq if x P D` .

(53)

Note that H implicitly also depends on the choice of y, s and K on the choice of x, s,
but we suppress this since we are, for the moment, only interested in the dependence of
H on x and of K on y. Furthermore, note that H and K are, a priori defined only as
holomorphic functions on the union D` Y D´ “ CzS, i.e. the complex plane minus the
circle. On the circle, we define the boundary values from the inside resp. the outside of
the disk (˘):
H ˘ pxq “

lim

zÑx,zPD˘

Hpzq,

K ˘ pyq “

lim

Kpzq,

Then the “jump conditions” (41), (42) imply that

K ´ pyq

`
`
H pxq “
K pyq “
e´s H ´ pxq if x P A,
e`s K ´ pxq if y P A.

(54)

(55)

Thus, both H resp. K are solutions to a Riemann-Hilbert-problem (across the contour
S). These problems are essentially completely understood, see e.g. [31, 32]. The number
and type of solutions depends in general on the specification of the behavior of H resp.
K near the boundary points tqj u of the multi-arc A “ Yj paj , bj q and at infinity, see e.g.
[31] (para. 79, pp 230) or [32] (para. 42, pp 420). In the case at hand, this behavior is
restricted by (40) and by the mode expansions of the fields.
A minor technical complication arises at this stage due to the fact that, as functions of
s, both H resp. K are only defined in the distributional sense, and our bound (40) likewise
also involves a test-function in s. This complication would make the direct application
15

of the results in [32, 31] somewhat cumbersome, so we give an explicit analysis of the
implications imposed by the Riemann-Hilbert problem in the case at hand taking into
account this complication.

Lemma 2. Kpyq

pyq
r
Proof. We first consider Kpyq.
The function ln ΠΠab pyq
“ 2πZ` pyq jumps by `2πi as
y crosses A from the inside of the unit disk to the outside. That jump compensates
r
precisely the jump (41) implied by the KMS condition, so that Kpyq
is continuous across
r
A. Similarly, (42) implies that Kpyq is continuous across the complement A1 as a function
r is an analytic function of y
of y, too. Therefore, by the edge-of-the-wedge theorem, K
r is a
in the entire complex plane minus the boundary points of the intervals. Since K
tempered distribution on S which away from the boundary points is the boundary value
r
of an analytic function (from either inside or outside the unit disk), it follows that K
cannot have any essential singularities at the boundary points y P tqj u. Indeed, at any
given boundary point, say aj , since we have a tempered distribution, there exists a natural
r
number N, such that, if we multiply Kpyq
by py ´ aj qN , we get a continuous function
near aj in y P S. By the edge of the wedge theorem, this function, being a boundary
value from both inside and outside the disk, must be holomorphic near aj . Actually, by
(40) we know the factor pΠa pyqΠb pyqqh cancels the potential blow up near aj when y P A,
and therefore we can actually choose N “ 0. Since this argument can be repeated for
r
any other boundary point, we learn that the function Kpyq
is analytic in y throughout
the entire complex plane. A similar statement holds for x and y interchanged and with
r and H
r interchanged.
K
r
We now establish a bound on the modulus of Kpyq
for |y| Ñ 8. We learn from the
´2ph`2h r
mode expansions and properties of the fields that y
Kpyq remains bounded. Thus,
r
we conclude that |Kpyq|
À |y|2hp´2h throughout the entire complex plane for some new
r
constant possibly depending on x P A and on the test-function f . Therefore, Kpyq
must

16

for fixed x P A be a polynomial in y of degree at most 2ph ´ 2h. We may repeat the
r and H
r reversed, and this finishes the
same argument with the roles of x and y and of K
proof.
The next lemma is a straightforward consequence of the preceding two lemmas.

Lemma 3. As a distribution on px, yq P S ˆ S (and s P R), we have (for Z´ , see (57)):

Proof. We consider the distributional boundary values for x Ñ A from within D´ and
for y Ñ A from within D` , respectively in the following expression

(60)

This boundary value prescription coincides with that for Γps, x, yq and thus the right side
is well-defined as a distribution in on A ˆ A (after smearing in s against a testfunction
f psq), by elementary results on products of distributions that are boundary values of

on this polynomial for all x, y P A. Since the coefficients, amn pf q, of this polynomial can
r xα , yβ q for 2hpp ´ 1q interpolation
be reconstructed by interpolation from the values Γpf,
points xα and 2hpp ´ 1q interpolation points yβ from A, this upper bound also holds
for amn pf q. By the well-known duality between the Banach spaces L1 pRq and L8 pRq
1
1
we can interpret this as saying that amn psqep 2 ´εq|s|` 2 s is a function in L1 pRq with norm
bounded from above by Cε´2h . Now set cnm psq “ anm psqes and use the relationship
Z` pxp1 ¯ εqq “ Z´ pxp1 ¯ εqq ¯ i{2 when ε Ñ 0` . Then the proposition follows after

If we wish, we can at this stage take an inverse Fourier transform of G in s to get a

Proof. 1) The formula (63) follows directly from lemma 3. In particular, the claimed
analyticity and bound (64) follow from the corresponding bounds on cmn psq. The formula
(65) follows from the KMS-condition. 2) For t “ 0 we evidently have ∆it “ 1. This

Remark 1. The domain of analyticity of p

|y| Ñ 8 or |x| Ñ 0. The constraint then confirms that p
cmn ptq “ 0 when m, n ą 2hpp ´ 1q.
As we will see, in certain special cases eq. (66) and the properties given in proposition
1 suffice to determine p
cmn uniquely. For instance we will see in subsec. 4.2 that for a
free fermion, the information we have obtained uniquely fixes the modular flow. For the
Up1q-current, the proposition is however already less restrictive, although we are still
able to get some results in subsec. 4.3. This is mainly because the polynomial Q is of
increasing degree and thus contains more free parameters for fields of higher dimension.
Also for this reason, we will introduce in sec. 5 another method.

Example: Modular flow of free Fermi field in vacuum (NS)state

As an application of these general results, we find the action of the modular flow of a
multi-arc A for the net AFermi in the vacuum state (Neveu-Schwarz sector), see example
7. Even though the free Fermi net is not local but graded local (the free Fermi field ψ
has h “ 21 ) we can easily adapt, in this simple case, our arguments leading to proposition
1 to fields obeying Fermi-statistics, i.e. fields of dimension h P 12 N. The main change
appears in (42), where there is now a pre-factor ´1 on the right side when φ “ ψ
obeys Fermi-statistics. This change propagates to eqs. (52) and (53), where there now
appears a pre-factor ´1 on the second line on the right sides in both equations. Following
through this sign change one sees that proposition 1 still holds if we replace (65) by
p
cmn pt ´ iq “ ´p
cnm p´tq.
To determine these functions, we may, in this simple case, test the relation (66) with
p points (and with h “ 21 ). We pick ζ, η P R not equal, and we let xl , yl P A Ă S, k, l “
1, . . . , p be the pre-images of ζ “ Zpxl q ‰ η “ Zpyk q, where Z “ Z´ is the function
defined by (57), and where A is the union of p open disjoint arcs in S as in (13). Testing
the constraint (66) with these points we get for the free Fermi field ψ

do not vanish since all the points xl , l “ 1, . . . , p are from disjoint intervals in A. Thus,
the Vandermonde matrices in (68) may be inverted and therefore p
cmn
ptq is uniquely
řp´1
determined. However, rather than finding the coefficients Qpx, yq “ m,n“0 Qnm xn y m
from (67) and inserting the inverses of the Vandermondians directly, we may observe
that one solution to the constraint (68) is of the form
p
cnm ptq “ ´

i Qnm
4π sinh πt

(70)

and this must hence be the unique solution. It is a good check that this solution is also
consistent with the general properties of proposition 1 (for h “ 21 ). Substituting the
solution into proposition 1 (for h “ 21 ) then gives:
Theorem 1. For the free massless real Fermi field on S and a multi-arc A “ Ypj“1paj , bj q Ă
S, the associated modular flow of the Neveu-Schwarz state is

D` , x approached from within D´ ) understood.

Since the action of the modular flow σ t is of second quantized form on the vacuum
Hilbert space, it follows that modular flow is uniquely determined by (71). We now obtain
the generator if the flow, thereby making contact with the original analysis due to [10]
based on eigenfunctions of the Cauchy kernel.
First, we transform our result from the circle to the lightray via the Caley transformation C : Szt`1u Ñ R, Cpxq
a “ ´ipx ` 1q{px ´ 1q. The lightray fields are then related to
the circle fields by ψS pxq “ C 1 pxqψR pCpxqq. In terms of the lightray fields, eq. (71) is
seen to retain its form, where the arcs of the circle paj , bj q become intervals pCpaj q, Cpbj qq
of the lightray. By abuse of notation, we can thus work with (71) and pretend that all
quantities, such as x, aj , bj , ψ, A (see (13)) refer to the lightray. Next, we go back from
(71) to the Fourier transform (37) using (105). This gives us for x, y P A Ă R,

As shown by [11] (eq. 2.11), we have GA Uk,s “ p1 ` e´s q´1 uk,s , and the functions Usk
in fact give
a spectral resolution of the operator GA . We can consequently write, with

In order to re-interpret this result on Fock space, it is convenient to give a slightly
different, but fully equivalent description of the theory tAFermi pIqu on the lightray. The

and where G is the operator defined by the Cauchy kernel. This operator is a projection which in momentum space corresponds to the multiplication with the characteristic

1-particle space K “ tf P L2 pRq | fˆpkq “ 0, @k ď 0u of square integrable functions f pxq
whose Fourier transform fˆpkq is non-zero only for k ě 0. In terms of this Fock-space, the
representation of the light ray fields can be written as
ψpf q “ a˚ pGf q ` apGf¯q,

(78)

where a˚ pgq, g P K are smeared creation operators defined as a˚ pgq|Ψy “ |g ^ Ψy on any
n-particle state |Ψy “ |Ψ1 ^ ¨ ¨ ¨ ^ Ψn y P ^n K Ă H.
The 1-particle version of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem implies that it is consistent to
introduce on the dense domain DphA q “ tGf | f P C08 pA, Cqu Ă K the “1-particle”
modular Hamiltonian hA as
hA : DphA q Ñ K,

hA pGf q :“ GkA f,

(79)

and as a consequence of (90), we can then write the modular flow of AFermi pAq for a

(81)

where HA “ 21 AˆA kA px, yqψpxqψpyqdxdy and kA the kernel of the operator on the right

for the modular flow found previously by [10]. Our arguments therefore in particular
provide a rigorous proof of the result by [10]. A rigorous proof in the case that A is a
symmetric p-interval was previously given by [33, 34] using different methods. They also
give a (slightly) corrected way to write this equation in exponentiated form, see eq. 4.3
of [33].

In the literature [40], such formulas have previously been proven for finite-dimensional fermion algebras.

4.3

Example: Modular flow of U p1q-current on S

The conformal net AU p1q for the free Up1q current algebra on the circle was defined in
example 6. Via the Caley transform C : Szt`1u Ñ R, Cpxq “ ´ipx ` 1q{px ´ 1q, one
obtains a corresponding net indexed by open intervals I Ă R of the real line (lightray)
or a union thereof. The circle and lightray currents are related by jS pxq “ C 1 pxqjR pCpxqq
and thus jR pxq˚ “ jR pxq. The corresponding lightray Weyl operators satisfy the same
relations as on the circle. The two-point function on the lightray is
xΩ0 |jpxqjpyq|Ω0 y “ ´

1
,
2π px ´ y ´ i0q2

(82)

and thus takes the same form as on the circle (25) up to the precise form of the boundary
value prescription.
We would next like to understand better the modular flow of the net AU p1q of the
free Up1q current algebra. In so far as proposition 1 is concerned, the discussion is
actually identical for any bosonic field φ of dimension d “ 1. First we note that for local
fields of conformal dimension h “ 1, 2, 3, . . . the method used for the free massless Fermi
field to determine p
cmn is inapplicable since the analog of the Vandermonde matrices,
n
n
Vl “ pxl q , l “ 1, . . . , p, n “ 1, . . . , 2hpp ´ 1q, that now appear in the analogue of (68)
for general h are no longer square matrices and hence not invertible as the sum over n, m
would now go up to 2hpp ´ 1q according to (66).
But we can obtain a weaker result for h “ 1 which will follow instantly from the
following two lemmas. The first lemma is taken from [11].
Lemma 4. Let xl P A Ă S, l “ 1, . . . , p (A the union of p open disjoint arcs as in (13))
be the pre-images of ζ “ Z´ pxl q as in (57). Then

Now let φ be a bosonic field of dimension d “ 1. For fixed ζ, consider the pre-images
xl P A, l “ 1, . . . , p of ζ “ Z´ pxl q inside the p open disjoint arcs (13). We can view the
xl “ xl pζq as functions of ζ and form the operator-valued distribution on R given by

Remark 2. As is well-known, the Up1q current can be represented on the Fock space
of two independent free real Fermion fields ψ1 , ψ2 by jpxq “ i : ψ1 ψ2 : pxq. In operator
algebraic terms, the Up1q-net is a subnet of two copies of the free Fermi net, see [24].
If one could show that there was a unit norm vacuum preserving conditional expectation
value from the Fermi algebra for region A to the current algebra of A (as follows from
the work by [24] when A is an interval by Haag duality), then the modular flow on the
current algebra AU p1q pAq would be that induced by the flow for the Fermi net (thm. 1),
by Takesaki’s theorem, see e.g. sec. 5 of [35]. At present, however, we do not know that
such a conditional expectation exists for multi-component regions A.
As a test, Thm. 1, eq. (71), can then be applied to r
jpζq defined as in (88). Alternatively, we my compute the left side of (71) using the modular flow of the free Fermi field(s)
given explicitly in [10, 33]. One sees after a computation that either results are consistent
with thm. 2. In the next section, we will again discuss the modular Hamiltonian for the
Up1q-current from a different perspective.

5

Thermal states

It is possible to analyse the modular flow of a thermal state in a similar manner as for
the vacuum state. However, we find it useful to use a variation of the method described
in the previous section which, in essence, corresponds to replacing the matrix elements of
the function ∆it with functions closely related to the resolvent, p∆ ´ λq´1 . Such matrix
elements will have certain analogous jump properties as the functions K, H introduced
above, but their exact form depends on the statistics (i.e. conformal dimension h) of the
field φpxq. The cases of fermionic5 and bosonic fields are treated separately in subsecs.
5.1, 5.3, respectively.
We will use the parametrization x “ e2πiu of the circle. Under this map A consists of
intervals Ypi“1 pai , bi q Ă p0, 1q. A1 is as before the interior of the complement. We define,
by a slight abuse of notations,
φpuq ” e2πihu φpe2πiu q.
5

(92)

In the case of fermionic fields, we have graded locality as in the example of the free Fermi field.

(93)

where the trace is taken in the vacuum (i.e. the defining) representation pπ0 , H0 q of the
net. We shall mostly take β to be real and positive, and occasionally use τ “ iβ{2π, which
is the periodicity of the correlation functions in imaginary direction in the coordinate u.
The general case can be obtained usually by analytic continuation in the end. Then it
follows immediately that ωβ is a β-KMS-state on A “ BpH0 q relative to the 1-parameter
automorphism group of rotations of the circle, i.e. translations in u. By the ReehSchlieder theorem, the GNS-vector |Ωβ y corresponding to ωβ is (cyclic and) separating
for ApAq “ _pi“1 ApIi q, and we can define a corresponding modular operator ∆ ” ∆β,A as
in the vacuum situation.

5.1

Fermionic fields

We begin by introducing a variant of the construction in the previous section involving
resolvents. For |Ωy ” |Ωβ y and ∆ ” ∆β,A , we set6
#
xΩ|φpuqrp∆ ` 1q´1 ` ξ ´ 21 s´1 φpvqΩy

The resolvents in these expressions are well defined if ξ P p 21 , 8q Y p´ 12 , ´8q in view
of ∆ ą 0, and the analytic continuations in u are justified by the KMS property for
the Gibbs state, because φpuq|Ωy is a vector-valued holomorphic function on the strip
tu P C | 0 ă ℑpuq ă β{2πu. φ is assumed to be a hermitian field of conformal dimension
h satisfying our assumptions 1. The relation to the modular Hamiltonian follows from
the formula

where u has a small negative imaginary part. Thus we should try to find F . Our first
lemma is the crucial tool expressing the analyticity/jump properties across the real u-axis.
Lemma 6. Let v P A be fixed. If u P A1 , then
F pξ, u ´ i0, vq “ F pξ, u ` i0, vq.

If u P A, then

in the sense of distributions. Here tφpuq, φpvqu “ φpuqφpvq ` φpvqφpuq is the anticommutator.
6

Here and in the following, we write φpuq for πω pφpuqq, where πω is the GNS representation of ω ” ωβ .

25

ş
Proof. We may formally write F pξ, u, vq “ R rpe´s ` 1q´1 ` ξ ´ 12 s´1 Hps, u, vqds, with
Hps, u, vq defined by analogy with (53), with “´” in the second line for fermionic fields.
Then the statement of the lemma the formally follows from the properties analogous to
(55). This argument is formal because Hpsq is defined a priori only after smearing with
test functions falling off exponentially, see lemma 1. However, we may also argue directly
in the following manner. First we let u, v P A and compute, with λ “ 21 ´ ξ

On the other hand, we also have

Here, we used the relations φpuq|Ωy “ φpuq˚ |Ωy “ Sφpuq|Ωy “ J∆ 2 φpuqΩy, the antiunitary property of J, and the property J∆´1 J “ ∆, which follow from Tomita-Takesaki
theory. Adding up these relations imply
pλ ´ 1qF pξ, u ` i0, vq ´ λF pξ, u ´ i0, vq “ ´xΩ|tφpuq, φpvquΩy,

(101)

which is equivalent to the statement of the lemma when u, v P A.
In the other case, when u P A1 , v P A, we use the formula (116). On this formula, we
act from the left with φpvq and from the left with φpuq and take the expectation value in
|Ω. Then we obtain a formula for F . Since u P A1 , v P A, we have r∆´it φpvq∆it , φpuqs “ 0
by Tomita-Takesaki theory, and using this formula to commute the operators inside the
expectation values, we get the claim of the lemma when u P A1 , v P A.
As in the previous section, the lemma shows that F pξ, u, vq defines a function of u for
fixed v P A that is analytic in the cut strip tu P C | |ℑpuq| ă β{2π, u R Au. Furthermore,
by the KMS condition, it can be checked that Hps, u ´ ipβ ´ 0q, vq “ ´Hps, u ` i0, vq,
which is also “ ´Hps, u ` 1 ` i0, vq by construction. Thus, F pξ, u, vq has the same
periodicity as the 2-point function xΩ|φpuqφpvqΩy, that is
F pξ, u ` 1, vq “ F pξ, u ` τ, vq “ ´F pξ, u, vq.

(102)

This allows us to define F as a function of u on the entire complex plane cut by A`Z`τ Z.
The limits from below the real axis define hermitian distributional kernels F pξ, u ´ i0, vq
that are of positive/negative type for ξ ą 21 resp. ξ ă ´ 21 , which follows from ∆ ą 0;
similarly for the limit from above the real axis. Similar statements hold when fixing u P A
and viewing F pξ, u, vq as a function of v.
26

As in the vacuum case studied in sec. 4.1, we would next like to have a result like
(40) of lemma 1 about the potential singularities of F at the end points of the intervals.
Unfortunately, the proof strategy of lemma 1 does not hold in the present case since we
have no analogue of the Hislop-Longo theorem for thermal states.
Instead, we will prove first a result comparing the modular operator of a thermal state
ωβ for the full algebra A “ BpH0 q to the modular operator for the partial algebra ApAq.
The point is that the former corresponds to rotations of the circle (i.e. translations of the
coordinate u) and is thus known. The idea is more precisely to apply eq. (46) to the case
M1 “ A, M2 “ ApAq (viewed as operator algebras on the GNS-Hilbert space Hβ ” H of
the thermal state ωβ ” ω), so we can define the modular operators ∆i of Mi on H with
respect to the cyclic and separating vector |Ωy ” |Ωω y.

The key idea is now the following. Suppose that, for |t| ă t0 and some t0 ą 0, we knew
that σ1t pXq is in M2 , so ∆it1 X|Ωy “ σ1t pXq|Ωy is in the domain DpS2 q, so I ´1 ∆it1 X|Ωy is in
H2 , so p1 ´ P2 qI ´1 ∆it1 X|Ωy “ 0. Then we can effectively restrict the range in the integral
to |t| ě t0 and drop the i0-prescription, and this is the moral reason for the existence of
our bound.
An even better estimate is obtained if instead we choose a, say even, real-valued
smooth function hptq ě 0 such that hptq “ 0 for |t| ă 12 and hptq “ 1 for |t| ě 1, say, and

Now we take a test function f compactly supported inside A and we denote the distance
of the support of f to the boundary of A by δ “ distpBA, supppf qq; of course δ ą 0.
Furthermore, we let tXn u be a sequence in M2 converging strongly to φpf q. Such a
27

sequence exists since we assume that the local fields are affiliated. Then (107) also holds
for X “ φpf q. We next wish to use the mode expansion (22) inside (107). Because
ω ” ωβ is a β-KMS state on M1 with respect to the automorphic actions of rotations
αt “ αgt , gt pzq “ e´iβt z, the modular flow ∆it1 corresponds to rotations in the sense that
∆it1 φpzq∆´it

In particular, since the modular flow preserves the state, we must have xφm Ω|φn Ωy “

Here, – denotes a regulated version of the integral described in the following remark.
ş
Remark/Definition: The meaning of the regularized integral operation– A is somewhat
subtle because because F ˘ pξ, u, vq “ F pξ, u ˘ i0, vq are distributions of u P R for fixed
ş
v P A. As such, there is no obvious meaning to the integral in cor. 1. To define – A ,
we must remember the origin of the formula from an integration along a contour fitting
tightly around A, see fig. 1. We consider tempered distributions Fr˘ pξ, u, vq of u P R
with the property that
(a) Fr` pξ, u, vq ´ Fr ´ pξ, u, vq “ F ` pξ, u, vq ´ F ´ pξ, u, vq,

(b) Fr˘ pξ, u, vq|A1 “ 0, as a distribution tested with functions of u having compact
support in A1 (thus away from any boundary point), and
31

(c) Fr˘ pξ, u, vq|A “ 0 satisfies the jump condition (119) of thm. 3 as a distribution tested
with functions of u having compact support in A (thus away from any boundary
point).
We then define the regulated integral by replacing F ´ with Fr´ , now integrated over all
u, which is now well-defined. Cor. 1 holds with this prescription, since (a), (b), (c) are
all that is used about F in the vicinity of the real axis in the above proof.
The existence of Fr˘ can be seen as follows. In A, it is defined to be equal to F ˘ . In
1
A , it is defined to zero. This defines distributions for all u P R, except for the boundary
points qi . We wish to define Fr˘ by a suitable distributional extension. At the boundary
points the unextended distributions have “scaling degree” at most ´h (by thm. 3), i.e.
finite. Therefore,
results (see e.g. [36]), an extension exists and is unique up
ř by
ř standard
˘ k pkq
to addition of qj kďh´1 Aj δ pu ´ qj q. The free parameters must be adjusted in such
a way that (c) holds for all u P R, not just inside A away from the boundary points, and
ş
such that paq still holds. This uniquely determines Fr˘ , and hence our prescription – A .7
The corollary imposes on F an integral equation at which we will look at in more detail
in the following example. The example also suggests that corollary 1 can be used to find
the modular operator in the case of a general fermionic primary field of dimension h.

Example: Modular Hamiltonian for thermal state of free
Fermi field

Now we analyze what we can learn from thm. 3 and cor. 1 for the free Fermi field, where
h “ 21 and tψpuq, ψpvqu “ δpu ´ vq1. For this theory, we can actually prescribe thermal
states (93) using either the Neveu-Schwarz or the Ramond representations. For the
Neveu-Schwarz (vacuum) sector, the representation is the half-integer moded expansion
(30), now denoted as ψNS pzq. For the Ramond-sector, the representation corresponds to
an integer moded expansion given in (33) now denoted as ψR pzq. The Gibbs states (93)
in the Neveu-Schwarz/Ramond representation correspond, accordingly, to the thermal
state vectors |ΩNS,β y and |ΩR,β y, respectively. The thermal 2-point functions are [37]:
xΩX,β |ψX puqψX pvqΩX,β y “ GX pu ´ v ´ i0q

(124)

where the subscript X P tR, NSu indicates the choice of boundary conditions (sector).
For NS, the definition was already given above in (125), whereas for R, we set
GR pu ´ vq “

ϑ11 pτ q ϑ2 pu ´ v; τ q
2πiϑ2 pτ q ϑ1 pu ´ v; τ q

(125)

Next we define FX as in (94). By thm. 3 we know its properties, with the only trivial
difference that FR ps, u ` 1, vq “ FR pξ, u, vq in the Ramond sector, where the subscript
X P tR, NSu indicates the choice of boundary conditions. These properties uniquely

etc.
By the well-known periodicity properties and pole/zero structure of the ϑ-functions, it
is easy to check that the above formula indeed satisfies the the properties known to hold
by thm. 3. For instance, the role of the second line is to give the required jump across
A, and the role of the pole at u “ v in the first line gives the delta-function in (116), also
consistent with (141). To show that F as given is the only solution to the properties in
thm. 3, we multiply any solution F with the inverse of the second line. This will cancel
the jump of F except for the delta function in (116). Thus, the multiplied F can have a
first order pole at u “ v mod Z with residue 1{pξ ´ 12 q, by (116). It cannot have poles,
however, at the end-points qi of the intervals, since thm. 3 tells us that |F | À |qi ´ u|´1{2 .
Thus, the multiplied function F is meromorphic with a single pole in the fundamental
parallelogram, with the same residue and periodicity properties as the first line. There
can only be one such function, by well-known results on elliptic functions.
Knowing F , we get the kernel of the modular hamiltonian xΩX,β |ψX puqpln ∆qψX pvqΩX,β y
by integrating up (96). Thus, we have, in principle, found this kernel. The (non-trivial)
integration over ξ in (96) has recently performed by [39, 38], who have independently
arrived at an analogous formula as for F for a closely related quantity, by a different
method based on resolvents. It is instructive to see more precisely how this method is
related to ours, as it may also shed light on how to proceed in the case of fields with
general conformal dimension h.
For this purpose, let us set GX pu ´ vq be the thermal 2-point function given by (124),
with X P tNS, Ru. By thm. 3, FX has the same periodicity as GX , so the combination
GX pu ´ v 1 qFX pξ, u, vq is doubly periodic in u for any fixed v P A. Thus, integrating again
around a contour γ˝ surrounding the fundamental parallelogram as in fig. 1, we get zero
as in (122), with G “ GX now in that equation. Such an identity also derived by [38]
via a different argument using the special properties of the free Fermi field. By contrast,
we have so far only used general properties and thm. 3, so our argument works for any
CFT.
Now, we deform again the contour γ˝ to a contour tightly surrounding the cuts A
inside the fundamental parallelogram, see fig. 1, use the jump properties and bounds on
F as given in thm. 3 and collect the residue. While these steps can still be performed
33

in any CFT according to thm. 3, the free Fermi case is especially simple because the
1

poles of F near the end-points qi of the intervals are of the order |u ´ qi | 2 , and hence
integrable. Thereby, we immediately get the integral equation

without any need for a regulator in the integral as in cor. 1. Dropping the subscript “ X ”
for ease of notation and indicating by GA ” G|A the restriction of the kernels (124) to
A ˆ A, we may view GA as an operator L2 pAq Ñ L2 pAq. In fact, the anti-commutation
relations and the positive nature of the Hilbert space inner product in (124) imply the
operator inequalities 0 ď GA ď 1. Now we define FA˘ pξq the operator defined by the
restriction F pξ, u ˘ i0, vq to A in kernel notation, i.e. when u, v P A. We can then also
write the above integral equation in operator notation as GA “ pGA ` ξ ´ 21 qFA´ pξq and
solve it as
FA´ pξq “ pGA ` ξ ´ 21 q´1 GA
(130)

when ξ P p 12 , 8qYp´ 12 , ´8q. In view of (96), we should then further calculate, in operator

Formally, this may also be expressed as saying HA “ 12 AˆA kA px, yqψpxqψpyqdxdy and
kA “ lnpG´1
A ´ 1q is the hamiltonian appearing in eq. (81). This is in accord with a
well known formula [41] for the modular Hamiltonian of the free Fermi field in terms
the restricted 2-point function GA , which can be derived using the Fock-space structure
of theory. In the present case, however, our derivation was rather different and can be
paralleled for fermionic fields in general CFTs which are not necessarily equivalent to free
field theories. As derived here, our formula holds for thermal states in either the NS or
the R sector, choosing for G either one of the 2-point functions (124). Thus, apart from
confirming our method, this relation to integral equations might also be useful in the case
of more general CFTs where one does not have a priori relations like (132).

5.3

Bosonic fields

We now repeat a similar analysis for a bosonic field φ of dimension h P N, satisfying our
standing assumptions 1. In fact, most results in sec. 5.1 for fermions hold just as well for
bosons, with nearly identical proof. A difference, however, arises in the jump condition
(98), which involves the anti-commutator of φ, whereas for bosons, we would like to have
the commutator. This means that we should work with a different definition of F , (94).
In the bosonic case, we instead define using the shorthands |Ωy ” |Ωβ y and ∆ ” ∆β,A

Since ∆ ą 0, F is well defined, in the distributional sense if s ą 0, and we refrain from
using a different symbol for F even though it is a different quantity compared to sec. 5.1.
The connection to the modular Hamiltonian now follows from the elementary formula

Thus, we should determine F . Again, the key result is a lemma expressing a jump

Altogether, this gives the following variant of thm. 3 for bosonic fields:
Theorem 4.
• For fixed v P A and s ą 0, F ps, u, vq is a holomorphic function
of u on the periodically cut complex plane CzpA ` Z ` τ Zq with the periodicity

• Analogous properties hold true for u Ø v.

Remark 3. We will see below that the theorem, or alternatively the following cor. 2,
may be used to find F , and thereby the modular Hamiltonian in view of (135). See sec.
5.4 for examples.
In the case of bosonic fields, it is apparently not straightforward to get an analog of
the integral equation in cor. 1. The problem is that G, the analogue of (125) should
have a simple pole at u “ v and be such that Gpu ´ u1 qF ps, u1, vq is doubly periodic
in u1 for fixed v P A. Since, by contrast to fermionic fields, F ps, u, vq is itself doubly
periodic in u, the simplest choice – in the absence of any other structural properties of
F , would be to choose G as doubly periodic, too. However, as is well known there is no
such meromorphic function with only one simple pole in the fundamental parallelogram.
We will, however, be able to make a similar construction below in the case of the Up1q
current, where F has an additional property.
In the general case, we can nevertheless still find an integral equation in the vacuum
case, where we can simply set Gpx´yq “ p2πiq´1 px´yq´1 . Here, we go back to the real line
picture in which the theory is living on R parameterized by x, y, and we correspondingly
write F ps, x, yq, etc. Thm. 4 still applies to the vacuum case: By inspection of the proof,
we can take in the end the limit β Ñ 8. A similar type of argument as for cor. 1 now
leads to (using xOn y “ 0 except when On “ 1 in the vacuum state):
Corollary 2. F defined as in (133) (for a bosonic primary field φ of dimension h in
standard nomalization (25)) satisfies for the vacuum state |Ωy ” |Ω0 y:
xΩ0 |φpxqφpyqΩ0y “F ps, x, y ` i0q

– dy 1 F ps, x, y 1 ` i0qpy 1 ´ y ´ i0q´1 .
2πi A

(142)

for x, y P A Ă R (lightray picture).

Proof. For the proof, we first work in the circle picture where x, y P S. For our assumptions about the fields, we have for z P D` “ tz : |z| ă 1u that φpzq|Ω0 y “
ř
n´h
φn |Ω0 y ř
which is holomorphic in D` . Likewise, for z P D´ “ tz : |z| ą 1u
něh z
that xΩ0 |φpzq “ něh z ´n´h xφn Ω0 | which is holomorphic in D´ and goes as |z|´2h for
|z| Ñ 8. This implies that, for fixed x P A, F ps, x, yq is a holomorphic function in CzA
decaying like |y|´2h for |y| Ñ 8. Now we consider y P D` , a small contour γ0 around
y 1 “ 0, and the identity
¿

dy 1 F ps, x, y 1qpy 1 ´ yq´1 “ 0.
(143)

γ0

We then move the contour γ0 across the cuts A as in fig. 2, deform it to a very large circle
γ8 , use the decay of F ps, x, y 1q as well as the jump conditions (140) across the cuts A and
collect the residue. The statement then follows after transforming back to the lightray
picture.

Example: Modular Hamiltonian of free U p1q-current

The Up1q current, j, was introduced in example 6 above. It has dimension h “ 1 and

(144)

Here, η1 , η2 are the constants appearing in connection with the Weierstrass ℘-function,
see appendix.
Guessing a – hopefully unique – answer for F just from the properties given in thm. 4
as in the case of the free Fermi field does not seem as straightforward for the current, so we
proceed by the more deductive method of integral equations. We have already mentioned
that for thermal states, we have not found a general way to obtain an analogue of cor.
1 for bosons. However, for the case of the U(1)-current, there is an additional structural
property which helps.
Consider the Weierstrass ζ-function satisfying ζ 1 “ ´℘, see appendix. It has a single
simple pole at u “ 0 in the fundamental parallelogram but is only quasi-periodic, ζpu `
1q “ ζpuq ` η1 , ζpu ` τ q “ ζpu; τ q ` η2 . As a consequence, the function ζpuq ´ η1 u is
periodic under u Ñ u ` 1, and changes by η2 ´ η1 τ “ ´2πi under u Ñ u ` τ . The
combination tζpv 1 ´ vq ´ pv 1 ´ vqη1 uF pξ, u, v 1q is also not doubly periodic in v 1 for any
fixed u P A. However, integrating around a contour γ˝ surrounding the fundamental
parallelogram as in fig. 1,

for all g, h P C08 pA, Rq. We then use the positive definite R-bi-linear form S to define
on C08 pA, Rq an inner product, which we then extend to a hermitian inner product by
complex anti-linearity in the first entry. Let this hermitian positive definite sesqui-linear
form be called p , qS . Its completion defines a Hilbert space, KA , which is contained in
1{2,2
the Sobolev space W0 pAq. It is the 1-particle space of the GNS-Fock space built on
|Ωy ” |Ωβ y. It follows from the definitions that KA Q f ÞÑ φpf q|Ωy P H is an isometry.
Furthermore, since r1 ´ es p1 ´ ∆˘1 q´1 s´1 is a bounded, self-adjoint operator on H for
s ą 0, it follows from (133) that the kernel F ˘ ps, x, yq “ F ps, x ˘ i0, yq extends to
a bounded quadratic form on KA , and hence can be identified with a bounded linear
operator on KA .
By Riesz’ theorem, there is a self-adjoint operator on this Hilbert space, ΣA , such that

Note that the terms in r. . . s do not depend on u, and therefore could be added in the
integral (145) in view of (146). Therefore, we can write our integral equation (147) in
operator form also as:

where FA` psq is the bounded operator on KA corresponding to the kernel F ps, u, v ` i0q.

This formula is sometimes quoted in the literature [40] for the matrix elements of the
modular Hamiltonian of a free boson field, and should be thought of as analogous to
(132) for the fermion field. A similar derivation also goes through if A “ Yi pai , bi q
consists of an arbitrary number of intervals. By contrast to the results in the literature,
our derivation is based on the rigorously derived integral equations, rather than a formal
analog with finite-dimensional quantum systems.
We now sketch how to find an explicit expression for the matrix element (156) of the
modular Hamiltonian in the case of one interval. To calculate the logarithm of operators,
we need the spectral decomposition of the self-adjoint operator Σ´1
A , which we write as

can see that (qi ranging over the endpoints a, b of the interval)

with boundary value prescription u ` i0 understood, is such a generalized eigenfunction.
This eigenfunction is constructed in such a way that is has a multiplicative jump by es
across the interval pa, bq (from the last term), and such that it is doubly periodic in u (cf.
table 1). Furthermore, near any one qi of the endpoints a, b, it is bounded by À |u ´ qi |´1
in accordance with thm. 4. The constants cqi psq are at first adjusted so that
ż1
– Vs pu ´ i0q du “ 0.

(159)

Then, we have again the relation (145) with Vs in place of F , and evaluating this contour integral by deforming the contour around the fundamental parallelogram to a tight
contour around pa, bq as in fig. 1 then gives the desired eigenvalue equation. That (159)
impose no actual loss of generality is demonstrated in the end.
Property (159) is evidently equivalent to

sec. 3 of [11] for further discussion of this point. The δ-function in this expression can
only come from the the contribution of the integrals near the boundary points qi , which
gives a practical way of evaluating these constraints.

Of these, only p ´ 1 are independent because (159) and the periodicity of Vs puq can be

A priori, (165), (165) are again a restriction on the possible set of eigenfunctions. But in
the end one shows that, in fact, all eigenfunctions of Σ´1

are equivalent to

ş near the

Conclusion

In this work we have studied the modular flows of multi-component regions in chiral
CFTs using methods from complex analysis. Our main tool was the KMS-condition built
into modular theory, which we have combined with input from CFT such as locality and
analyticity. The main general results concern matrix elements of the modular operator of
the general type xΩ|φpxqf p∆qφpyqΩy, where f are various functions such as ln, resolvents,
complex powers, and φ a primary field. The states |Ωy studied in this work were the
vacuum and Gibbs (thermal) states. In some cases, our results for the matrix elements
can be expressed in terms of integral equations of Cauchy-type [32, 31], see e.g. cor. 1,
2.
Solving these types of equations was possible in a number of examples, such as free
fermions and the Up1q-current. To keep the paper at a reasonable length, we have not
carried out in this work all the resulting integrations, which would be needed if one is
interested in more explicit answers. This would be possible. In the examples considered,
we were also able to explain the relationship with known results in the literature [10, 11,
39, 38], and also with certain general, but formal (in the QFT context), methods known
specifically for such free field theories, see [40, 41]. In this sense, our methods also serve
to make these formal approaches rigorous.
Our analysis is, in principle, not limited to such free CFTs, and in fact e.g., cor. 1, 2,
refer to general primary fields in an arbitrary chiral CFT, subject only to certain standard
assumptions. It would be interesting to study the implications of these general results
further, which we leave for future work [42].
