Abstract. We study actions of bosonizations of quantum linear spaces on quantum algebras. Under mild
conditions, we classify actions on quantum affine spaces and quantum matrix algebras. In the former case,
it is shown that all actions of generalized Taft algebras are trivial extensions of actions on quantum planes.
In both cases we achieve bounds on the rank of the bosonization acting on the algebra.

1. Introduction
Due to the principle of quantum rigidity, quantum algebras exhibit few classical symmetries, i.e., linear
group actions. For example, the automorphism group of the quantum plane kq [u, v] with q 2 6= 1 is isomorphic
to (k× )2 [1]. Here quantum algebras will not take on a specific meaning, but will generally be understood to
represent some algebra whose relations depend on parameters in k. This includes quantum affine spaces and
quantum matrix algebras, both of which are fundamental objects in the study of noncommutative algebra
and noncommutative algebraic geometry.
In many cases, the (graded/filtered) automorphism group for quantum algebras are known, see, e.g.,
[1, 7, 27]. The natural next step, then, is to study quantum symmetries, or actions by Hopf algebras.
Semisimple Hopf actions on quantum planes and quantum Weyl algebras are well-understood [8, 9]. Our
goal is to better understand non-semisimple Hopf actions, specifically actions by pointed Hopf algebras,
which themselves have attracted much recent interest [11, 17].
The impetus for this work was a classification by Won, Yee, and the second-named author of Taft algebra
actions on quantum planes and quantum Weyl algebras [14]. Here we ask how much this classification can
be extended. We do this in several ways. First, we look at actions of generalized Taft algebras and find that
the classification problem is not significantly different. Secondly, we consider actions on higher-dimensional
algebras, specifically quantum affine spaces and quantum matrix algebras. Finally, we study actions of
bosonizations of quantum linear spaces (see [3, 13]).
Bosonizations of quantum linear spaces form an important subclass within the classification of finitedimensional pointed Hopf algebras of Andruskiewitsch and Schneider [4]. In some sense, they may be
thought of as higher rank generalized Taft algebras. Under mild hypotheses — in particular, we require all
parameters have order greater than 2 — we classify actions of generalized Taft algebras on quantum affine
spaces and quantum matrix algebras. This is then extended to determine all actions of bosonizations of
quantum linear spaces, again under mild hypotheses. Specifically, we achieve bounds on the rank of these
bosonizations. It is our hope that our methods may be applied for further classifications and a long term
goal is to understand the classification of all finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras on these algebras.
2. Preliminaries
Throughout, k is an algebraically closed, characteristic zero field and all algebras are associative k-algebras.
All unadorned tensor products should be regarded as over k. For a Hopf algebra H, and grouplike elements
g, h ∈ G(H), we denote by Pg,h the (g, h)-skew-primitive elements, i.e. all x ∈ H so thatL
∆(x) = g ⊗x+x⊗h.
An algebra A is (N)-graded if there exists a vector space decomposition A =
i∈N A(i) such that
A(i) · A(j) ⊂ A(i+j) . Further, A is connected if A(0) = k, affine if A(k) is finite-dimensional as a k-vector
space for all k, and generated in degree one if A(1) generates A as an algebra. With the exception of one
family in Section 5, all algebras considered in this work are affine connected graded and generated in degree
one.

2.1. Quantum algebras. Here we define more formally our algebras of interest. Our standard reference is
[5].
A matrix p = (pij ) ∈ Mt (k× ) is multiplicatively antisymmetric if pii = 1 and pij = p−1
ji for all i, j. Given a
multiplicatively antisymmetric matrix p, the quantum affine space, denoted A = kp [u1 , . . . , ut ], is generated
by u1 , . . . , ut subject to the relations ui uj = pij uj ui . If I ⊂ {1, . . . , t}, then we denote by AI the subalgebra
of A generated by the ui , i ∈ I. If I = {i, j}, then we simply write Aij for the quantum plane kpij [ui , uj ].
Let q ∈ k× . We denote by Oq (Mn (k)) the single parameter quantum n × n matrix algebra. It is generated
by Yij for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n with relations


Yℓm Yij + (q − q )Yim Yℓj , (i < ℓ, j < m).
For Oq (M2 (k)), we will use the traditional notation A = Y1,1 , B = Y1,2 , C = Y2,1 , D = Y2,2 . Thus,
Oq (M2 (k)) has relations
AB = qBA,

AC = qCA,

BD = qDB,

CD = qDC,

BC = CB,

AD = DA + (q − q −1 )BC.

By [12, Theorem 5.2], under certain conditions on p, the action of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra on
kp [u1 , . . . , ut ] factors through a group action. In particular, this holds when pij = q ∈ k× for all i > j (the
single parameter case) and q is not a root of unity. That is, these algebras possess no true finite-dimensional
quantum symmetry. Similarly, since Frac(Oq (MN (k))) is isomorphic to a kp [u1 , . . . , uN 2 ] for suitable p [10],
then a similar result holds in this setting. Part of the current work is to better understand the quantum
symmetries when the parameters fall outside of these conditions.
2.2. Quantum linear spaces. Let θ ∈ N, G a finite abelian group, g = g1 , . . . , gθ ∈ G, and χ =
b = Hom(Groups) (G, k× ) such that χi (gj ) = χj (gi )−1 for i 6= j and mi := ord(χi (gi )) ≥ 2.
χ1 , . . . , χθ ∈ G
Let R(g1 , . . . , gθ , χ1 , . . . , χθ ) be a quantum linear space over G, that is, the braided Hopf algebra in kG
kG YD,
generated by x1 , . . . , xθ , with relations
i
= 0,
xm
i

xi xj = χj (gi )xj xi (i 6= j).

The coalgebra structure is determined by xi ∈ P1,1 . The comodule and module structure are determined by
δ(xi ) = gi ⊗ xi ,

h · xi = χi (h)xi

(h ∈ G).

For g ∈ G, let νg = #{i | gi = g}.
The bosonization H := R#kG is the Hopf algebra (over k) generated by G, x1 , . . . , xθ , with the relations
of G as well as
i
= 0, xi xj = χj (gi )xj xi (i 6= j), hxi = χi (h)xi h (h ∈ G),
xm
i
with G = G(H) and xi ∈ Pgi ,1 (H). Throughout, we denote H by B(G, g, χ) and refer to θ as its rank. We
will primarily in this paper be concerned with actions of B(G, g, χ) on various families of algebras.
Example 2.1. Let G = Z9 = hgi and let ω be a primitive 9th root of unity. Set g1 = g and g2 = g 4 and
b by χ1 (g) = ω 3 and χ2 (g) = ω 6 . Then
define χ1 , χ2 ∈ G
χ1 (g1 ) = ω 3 ,

χ1 (g2 ) = ω 3 ,

χ2 (g2 ) = ω 6 ,

χ2 (g1 ) = ω 6 .

It now follows that all of the compatibility criteria are met. In particular,
χ1 (g2 )χ2 (g1 ) = 1,

ord(χ1 (g1 )), ord(χ2 (g2 )) ≥ 2.

Thus, B(G, {g1 , g2 }, {χ1 , χ2 }) is a rank 2 bosonization of a quantum linear space.
Let γ ∈ k, let n, m ∈ N such that m | n, and let λ ∈ k be a primitive mth root of unity. The generalized
Taft algebra Tn (λ, m, γ) is generated by a grouplike element g and a (g, 1)-skew primitive element x subject
to the relations
g n = 1, xm = γ(g m − 1), gx = λxg.
2

c is chosen such that χ(g) = λ, then Tn (λ, m, 0) = B(hgi, g, χ) and Tn (λ, n, 0) is the nth Taft algebra
If χ ∈ hgi
[26]. Given B(G, g, χ), we denote by Bi the subalgebra of B generated by {gi , xi }. Then Bi ∼
= Tni (λi , mi , 0)
as Hopf algebras. Here, ni denotes ord(gi ), λi := χi (gi ), and mi = ord(λi ).
In the B(G, g, χ), the xi are all nilpotent. However, we may occasionally drop the nilpotency requirement
when considering general pointed Hopf algebras of rank one. We do not define rank here, but use the
following classification of rank one pointed Hopf algebras in characteristic zero, due to Krop and Radford.
Theorem 1 ([20, Theorem 1]). Let G be a finite group with character map χ : G → k× , and take g ∈ Z(G)
and γ ∈ k. Set m = ord(χ(g)). Let H(G, g, χ, γ) denote the Hopf algebra generated by G and a (g, 1)-skewprimitive element x subject to the group of relations of G and the relations
xm = γ(g m − 1)

and

ax = χ(a)xa

for all a ∈ G. Every finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebra of rank one is isomorphic to H(G, g, χ, γ) for
some G, g, χ, and γ.
2.3. Hopf actions. We say that a Hopf algebra H acts on an algebra A if A is a left H-module algebra.
That is, A is a left H-module with action h ⊗ a 7→ h · a such that
X
h · 1A = ε(h)1A and h · (aa′ ) =
(h1 · a)(h2 · a′ ) (for all h ∈ H and a, a′ ∈ A).

The action is said to be inner faithful if there is no nonzero Hopf ideal that annihilates A. For Taft algebras,
this is equivalent to the existence of an element a ∈ A such that x · a 6= 0 [17, Lemma 2.5]. We now explore
the question of inner faithfulness for actions of the B(G, g, χ).
If V denotes the k-span of x1 , . . . , xθ , then the action of G on V given by h · xi = χi (h)xi is faithful if
and only if for each h 6= 1 in G, there exists i such that χi (h) 6= 1. Let N = {h ∈ G | χi (h) = 1 for all i}
denote the kernel of the action. Note that the induced action of G/N on V is faithful, and that we can
realize R(g1 , . . . , gθ , χ1 , . . . , χθ ) as a quantum linear space over G/N .
Definition 2.2. We say that R(g1 , . . . , gθ , χ1 , . . . , χθ ) is a faithful quantum linear space over G if the action
of G on V is faithful.
Example 2.3. (1) Let T = Tn (λ, m, 0). Note that T is the bosonization R(g, χ)#kG where G is the cyclic
group of order n with generator g, λ is a primitive mth root of unity, and χ is defined by χ(g) = λ. Thus,
R(g, χ) in this case is a faithful quantum linear space over hgi if and only if χ(g ℓ ) 6= 1 whenever 0 < ℓ < n.
Equivalently, λℓ 6= 1 for 0 < ℓ < n. Since m = ord(λ) divides n, it follows that the action is faithful if and
only if m = n, whence T is a Taft algebra.
(2) More generally, if G is a finite abelian group and R(g, χ) is a quantum linear space over G of rank
one, then it is easy to show that R(g, χ) is faithful over G if and only if G is cyclic and χ is a generator of
b
G.
The inner faithfulness of actions of bosonizations of faithful quantum linear spaces depends only on the
actions of the xi . To show this, we require the following facts.
Lemma 2.4 ([11, Lemma 1.2]). Let H be a pointed Hopf algebra and I a nonzero Hopf ideal of H. Then I
contains a nonzero element of Pg,1 (H) for some g ∈ G(H).

Lemma 2.5 ([3, Corollary 5.3]). In the Hopf algebra R(g1 , . . . , gθ , χ1 , . . . , χθ )#kG, we have



Proposition 2.6. Let R(g1 , . . . , gθ , χ1 , . . . , χθ ) be a faithful quantum linear space over a finite abelian group
G. Also, assume that for any g ∈ G satisfying νg ≥ 2, we have mi 6= 2 (i.e. χi (gi ) 6= −1) for all i such that
gi = g. Then an action of H := R#kG on some algebra A is inner faithful if and only if each xi acts by
nonzero.
Proof. First, if some xi acts by zero, then the (Hopf) ideal generated by xi gives a nonzero Hopf ideal which
acts by zero, so the action is not inner faithful.
3

On the other hand, suppose the action is not inner faithful, and let I denote a nonzero Hopf ideal which
acts by zero. Let g and xi denote the generators of H/I. By Lemma 2.4, there is some nonzero a ∈ Pg,1 (H)∩I
for some g ∈ G(H). Suppose a ∈ k(1 − g), so g = 1 in H/I. Then for each xi , we have
xi = gxi = χi (g)xi g = χi (g)xi .
Since R is a faithful quantum linear space over G, we must have that χi (g) 6= 1 for some i, and thus, xi ∈ I.
Hence, xi acts by zero.
Now P
suppose that a ∈
/ k(1
P − g), so νg ≥ 1. Then by Lemma 2.5, we have two cases to check: a =
1 − g + i:gi =g αi xi or a = i:gi =g αi xi . We assume the former first. Since νg ≥ 1, we have αi 6= 0 for at
P
least one i; without loss of generality, this is 1. Thus, in I, we have g = 1 + i:gi =g αi xi . Therefore, we have
gx1 = χ1 (g)x1 g, i.e. that

Using the fact that xi x1 = χ1 (g)x1 xi for all i 6= 1 such that gi = g, we have
x1 + α1 x21 = χ1 (g)x1 + χ1 (g)α1 x21 .

−1 m−1
m
x1 . Hence, x1 = 0, or x1 ∈ I.
Since χ1 (g) 6= 1, we have x21 = −α−1
1 x1 . Inductively, x1 = (−α1 )
For the second case, we note first that νg ≤ 2. Otherwise, we have χ1 (g1 ) = χ1 (g2 ) = χ2 (g1 )−1 = χ2 (g2 )−1 ,
and similarly that χ2 (g2 ) = χ3 (g3 )−1 and χ3 (g3 ) = χ1 (g1 )−1 . Therefore, for each gi = g, we have χi (gi ) = −1,
contrary to our hypothesis. Thus, we may assume x1 − αx2 ∈ I with g1 = g2 and α 6= 0. In H/I, we have
x1 = αx2 . For every h ∈ G, the relation hx1 = χ1 (h)x1 h yields

χ2 (h)αx2 h = αhx2 = χ1 (h)αx2 h.
If χ1 = χ2 , then χ1 (g1 ) = χ2 (g2 ) = χ1 (g1 )−1 , so χ1 (g1 ) = −1, contrary to our hypothesis. Therefore, for

some h ∈ G, χ1 (h) 6= χ2 (h), and so x2 h = 0. Since h is a unit, x2 = 0, or x2 ∈ I.
By the above, we can always replace G by a quotient so that R is faithful, in which case Proposition 2.6
applies. For this reason, when dealing with actions of B(G, g, χ), we often assume merely that each xi acts
by nonzero, rather than the more strict assumption that the action be inner faithful.
Whenever some B(G, g, χ) acts on an affine connected graded algebra A that is generated in degree 1, we
assume that actions are linear, that is gi · A(1) , xi · A(1) ⊂ A(1) . This means that, by an abuse of notation, we
can represent the gi and xi as matrices, which we do throughout. We say that gi acts diagonally on A if gi is
represented by a diagonal matrix. As each gi is a grouplike in B, then it necessarily acts as an automorphism
on A.
The next result, though simple, will be of great assistance in all of our classifications.
Lemma 2.7. Suppose H(G, g, χ, γ) acts linearly and inner faithfully on a connected graded affine algebra
A, which is generated by A(1) = Spank {u1 , . . . , ut }. Assume that g acts diagonally on A(1) and m ≥ 3. Also,
assume the action of x is linear with the action on the basis (u1 , . . . , ut ) of A(1) given by the matrix (ηij ).
Then for all i, j, ηij ηji = 0. In particular, for all k, ηkk = 0.
Proof. Set λ = χ(g). Let αi ∈ k× be defined by g · ui = αi ui . A computation shows that the coefficient for
ui in (gx − λxg) · uk is
(2.8)

ηik (αi − λαk ).

It follows that 0 = ηkk αk (1 − λ), so ηkk = 0. Furthermore, if for some i 6= j, ηij and ηji are nonzero, then
we have αi = λαj = λ2 αi , implying ord(λ) ≤ 2, contradicting our standing hypotheses.

2.4. Results. Suppose a generalized Taft algebra T = Tn (λ, m, 0) acts on a quantum affine space A =
kp [u1 , . . . , ut ], t ≥ 3. We say the action of T is a trivial extension of the action on AI if x · uj = 0 for all
j∈
/ I. We show in Theorem 3.9 that every action of a generalized Taft algebra on a quantum affine space is a
trivial extension of an action on a quantum plane subalgebra, given in Proposition 3.1, or a certain quantum
3-space subalgebra. This is then applied to prove the following.

Theorem (Theorem 3.13). Suppose B = B(G, g, χ) has rank θ, and that B acts linearly and inner faithfully
on A = kp [u1 , . . . , ut ], t ≥ 2. Assume mi for all i and ord(pij ) for all i 6= j are at least 3. Then θ ≤ 2(t − 1).
In Propositions 4.4 and 4.11, we completely classify actions of generalized Taft algebras on quantum
matrix algebras under mild hypotheses. In general, the action of x in this case corresponds to shifting a row
or column. From this, we achieve the following result.
Theorem (Theorems 4.8 and 4.18). Let q ∈ k× with q 6= ±1. Also, let B(G, g, χ) be a bosonization of
rank θ with mi ≥ 3 for all i. Suppose B(G, g, χ) acts on Oq (MN (k)) with each gi acting as an element of
(k× )2n−1 ⋊ hτ i and each xi acting linearly and nonzero. Then,

2(N − 1) if N ≥ 3.
In Section 5, we consider some peripheral results. First, we consider invariants of generalized Taft actions
on quantum planes. Results for actions on kp [u1 , . . . , ut ] and Oq (MN (k)) are used to study actions and
obtain bounds on quantum exterior algebras (Proposition 5.8), quantum Weyl algebras (Proposition 5.9), as
well as Oq (GLN (k)) and Oq (SLN (k)) (Proposition 5.11). We propose a number of extensions to this work
and additional questions in Section 6.
3. Quantum affine spaces
In this section, we primarily consider actions on quantum affine spaces, and discuss the first quantum
Weyl algebra. As a warm-up, we consider the algebra A = khu, v | uv − µvu − κi and ord(µ) = k > 1.
µ
Then A = kµ [u, v] when κ = 0. When κ 6= 0, A ∼
= A1 (k), a quantum Weyl algebra. The following result is a
generalization of [14, Proposition 2.1] to the case of generalized Taft algebra actions on quantum planes and
quantum Weyl algebras.
Proposition 3.1. Let A = kµ [u, v] or Aµ1 (k), and let ord(µ) = k > 1. Then T = Tn (λ, m, 0) acts linearly
and inner faithfully on A if and only if n = lcm(k, m) and the action is given by one of the following:
(a) g · u = µu, g · v = λ−1 µv, x · u = 0, x · v = ηu for some η ∈ k× , and if A = Aµ1 (k) then λ = µ2 ; or
(b) g · u = λ−1 µ−1 u, g · v = µ−1 v, x · u = ηv for some η ∈ k× , x · v = 0, and if A = Aµ1 (k) then λ = µ−2 .
Proof. By [1, 2], either g acts diagonally or anti-diagonally with respect to the given generators. There are
no linear actions with g acting non-diagonally on the given generators when x · A 6= 0 and the proof of this
follows similarly to [14, Proposition 2.1]. Thus, we will assume that g acts diagonally with respect to the
given generators.
With respect to the basis {u, v} for A1 , let x = (ηij ) and g = diag(α1 , α2 ) where αi ∈ k× are nth
roots of unity. In the case A = Aµ1 (k) we have the additional restriction that α2 = α−1
1 . By Lemma 2.7,
η11 = η22 = 0. Moreover, η12 = 0 or η21 = 0, but not both.
If η21 = 0, then x · u = 0 and x · v = η12 u. Furthermore,
0 = x · (uv − µvu − κ) = (α1 − µ)η12 u2 .
Thus, α1 = µ and so by (2.8), α2 = λ−1 µ. In the case of Aµ1 (k), this implies λ = µ2 . Similarly, if η12 = 0,
then x · u = η21 v, x · v = 0 and (1 − µα2 )η21 v 2 = 0 so α2 = µ−1 wherein α1 = λ−1 µ−1 . In the case of Aµ1 (k),
this implies λ = µ−2 . In either case, to satisfy g n = 1, we must have k | n.
Suppose the action of T on A is given as above. Then x 6= 0 and so T acts inner faithfully if g
acts faithfully on A. The result then follows because the order of the (matrix representation) of g is
lcm(ord(µ), ord(λ−1 µ)) = lcm(ord(µ), ord(λ)) = lcm(k, m).

One of our goals will be to approach a classification along the lines of Proposition 3.1 for quantum affine
spaces. Though we do not state our classification so explicitly, we do characterize all actions on quantum
affine spaces in a way that we detail below.
By [18, Lemma 3.5(e)] and under our hypotheses, namely pij 6= 1, any automorphism on a quantum affine
space A = kp [u1 , . . . , ut ] may be represented by a monomial matrix. That is, if g ∈ Aut(A), then there exists
σg ∈ St such that for all k, g · uk = αk uσg (k) for some αk ∈ k× . We will show that under certain conditions
we are able to limit the permutations associated to g.
5

Pt
Suppose A is an algebra generated by u1 , . . . , ut . Under the linearity hypothesis, x · uk = i=1 ηik ui for
all k. We say ui is a summand of x · uk if ηik 6= 0. Alternatively, we say that x · uk contains ui as a summand.
Lemma 3.2. Suppose H(G, g, χ, γ) acts linearly and inner faithfully on A = kp [u1 , . . . , ut ], t, ord(pij ) ≥ 3.
If x is nilpotent or m > t, then g acts diagonally on A.
Proof. Our goal is to show that ord(σg ) = 1. Note that
(3.3)

0 = g · (ui uj − pij uj ui ) = αi αj (uσg (i) uσg (j) − pij uσg (j) uσg (i) ) = αi αj (pσg (i)σg (j) − pij )uσg (j) uσg (i) .

First suppose that σg is a t-cycle. After possibly renumbering the generators of A, we may assume that
the action of g on A is defined by g · ui = αi+1 ui+1 for 1 ≤ i < t and g · ut = α1 u1 . Set λ = χ(g). Then for
k < t,
(gx−λxg) · uk = g · (η1k u1 + · · · + ηtk ut ) − λx · (αk+1 uk+1 )

= η1k (α2 u2 ) + · · · + η(t−1)k (αt ut ) + ηtk (α1 u1 ) − λαk+1 (η1(k+1) u1 + · · · + ηt(k+1) ut )

= (ηtk α1 − λαk+1 η1(k+1) )u1 + (η1k α2 − λαk+1 η2(k+1) )u2 + · · · + (η(t−1)k αt − λαk+1 ηt(k+1) )ut .

A similar computation with ut now shows that for any k,
αk+1

(3.4)
η1k = λ
η2,k+1 = λ2
η3,k+2 = . . .

α2 α3
where subscripts are understood (mod t) + 1. Thus, entries along skew diagonals of x are either all zero or
all nonzero. For 1 < j < n,
x · (u1 uj − p1j uj u1 ) = [(α2 u2 )(x · uj ) + (x · u1 )uj ] − p1j [(αj+1 uj+1 )(x · u1 ) + (x · uj )u1 ] .
When j = n the same computation holds but αj+1 uj+1 is replaced by α1 u1 . Since by (2.8) u1 is not a
summand of x · u1 , then it is clear that u21 appears as a summand only in the product (x · uj )u1 . As
p1j 6= 0, it must be that η1j = 0. It follows from (3.4) that x is represented by the diagonal matrix
diag(a, λ−1 a, · · · , λ−(t−1) a) with ord(λ) ≤ t. Such a matrix is nilpotent if and only if x = 0.
Next assume that σg = (1 2 · · · k) for some 1 < k < t. If k = 2, then by (3.3), p12 = p21 = p−1
12 , contradicting our hypothesis on the pij . Hence, we may assume that k > 2 and also that t > 2. The proof above
shows that the upper-left k × k block of x will be a diagonal matrix of the form diag(a, λ−1 a, · · · , λ−(k−1) a)
with ord(λ) ≤ k < t. Let i ≤ k and k + 1 ≤ j ≤ t. Then
(3.5)

x · (ui uj − pij uj ui ) = ((g · ui )(x · uj ) + (x · ui )uj ) − pij ((g · uj )(x · ui ) + (x · uj )ui ).

Since ui is not a summand of g · ui or g · uj it follows that the coefficient of u2i is −pij ηij , so ηij = 0. Now x
is represented by a block lower-triangular matrix where the upper left block is the stated diagonal matrix,
whence x is not nilpotent.
Finally, we assume that σg = τ1 · · · τℓ for disjoint nontrivial cycles τi . After possibly renumbering the
generators, write τ1 = (1 2 · · · k), τ2 = (k + 1 k + 2 · · · k + k ′ ), and so on. We partition x into blocks (Xij )
where Xii is a ord(τi ) × ord(τi ) matrix. The arguments above show that Xii will be diagonal matrices and
that ord(λ) ≤ ord(τi ) for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ. Moreover, the argument following (3.5) shows that Xij = 0 for
i < j. But then x is not nilpotent.

In light of Lemma 3.2, we assume
P henceforth that g acts diagonally on a quantum affine space, so g · ui =
αi ui for some αi ∈ k and x · uj = ηij ui . The next lemma shows that the possible actions of x are limited.

Lemma 3.6. Suppose H(G, g, χ, γ) acts linearly and inner faithfully on A = kp [u1 , . . . , ut ]. Assume m, t,
and ord(pij ) for i 6= j are all at least 3, and that g acts diagonally on A.

For all i, j, ηij ηji = 0. In particular, for all k, ηkk = 0.
There is at most one nonzero entry in each column of x.
There is at most one nonzero entry in each row of x.
If t > 3 and i, j, k, ℓ are all distinct, then ηij ηkℓ = 0.
If m 6= 3, then the matrix x is nilpotent.
If ord(g) = m or t ≤ m 6= 3, then γ = 0.

Proof. (1) This is Lemma 2.7.
(2) Suppose that ηrk , ηsk 6= 0, with r < s. By (1), r, s 6= k. Then
0 = x · (ur uk − prk uk ur )


i6=r

+ ηsk (αr prs − prk )us ur + (terms not involving

j6=k

u2r

and us ur ).

Thus, αr prs = prk = αr , so prs = 1, a contradiction.
(3) Suppose ηrℓ , ηrk 6= 0 with ℓ < k. Again by (1), ℓ, k 6= r. By (2), we have x · uℓ = ηrℓ ur and
x · uk = ηrk ur . A computation as above shows that the u2r coefficient in x · (ur uℓ − prℓ uℓ ur ) is ηrℓ (αr − prℓ )
and in x · (ur uk − prk uk ur ) is ηrk (αr − prk ). Now
0 = x · (uℓ uk − pℓk uk uℓ )
= (αℓ uℓ (ηrk ur ) + (ηrℓ ur ) uk ) − pℓk (αk uk (ηrℓ ur ) + (ηrk ur ) uℓ )
= ηrk (αℓ − pℓk prℓ )uℓ ur + ηrℓ (prk − pℓk αk )uk ur .
By (2.8), αr = λαℓ = λαk , so αℓ = αk . Then
2
2
αℓ = pℓk prℓ = αk−1 prk prℓ = α−1
k αr = αℓ λ .

Thus λ2 = 1, a contradiction.
(4) Assume i, j, k, ℓ are all distinct and ηij , ηkℓ 6= 0, so necessarily t > 3. Also, by (2) and (3), these are the
distinct nonzero elements in their respective row and column. The coefficient of uk ui in x · (ui uℓ − piℓ uℓ ui )
is ηkℓ (αi pik − piℓ ) and in x · (uj uk − pjk uk uj ) it is ηij (pik − αk pjk ). Moreover,
x · (uj uℓ − pjℓ uℓ uj ) = ηij (piℓ − αℓ pjℓ )uℓ ui − ηkℓ (αj pjk − pjℓ )uk uj .
Because ηij , ηkℓ 6= 0, then by (2.8), αi = λαj and αk = λαℓ . Hence,
−1
−1
−2
α−1
αi α−1
ℓ αi pik = αℓ piℓ = pjℓ = αj pjk = αj αk pik = λ
ℓ pik .

It follows that λ2 = 1, a contradiction.
(5) When t = 2, the matrix x is nilpotent by (1). Let ηij be a nonzero entry in x. After possibly
renumbering generators, we may assume that j > i. By (2) and (3), ηij is the only nonzero entry in its row
and column. Moreover, by (4), the only other possible nonzero entries are of the form ηℓi or ηjk for some
ℓ 6= i and k 6= j. Suppose both are nonzero. By (1), we also have ℓ 6= j and k 6= i. If ℓ 6= k, then ηℓi ηjk = 0
by (4), so ℓ = k. But then by (2.8), we have αk = λαi = λ2 αj = λ3 αk , so λ3 = 1, a contradiction. Thus, at
most one of ηℓi or ηjk is nonzero and it is clear that x is nilpotent.
(6) If ord(g) = m, then the result is clear. Assume ord(g) 6= m and t ≤ m 6= 3. By (5), x is nilpotent so
g acts diagonally by Lemma 3.2. Since x acts linearly, then xk = 0 for some k ≤ t, so 0 = xm = γ(g m − 1).
Thus, either γ = 0 or g m acts trivially. In the latter case, ord(g) = m by the inner faithful hypothesis, but
this contradicts our hypotheses, so γ = 0.

Without the hypothesis that m 6= 3, it is possible to have actions of rank one pointed Hopf algebras in
which x is not nilpotent.
Example 3.7. Suppose m = 3 and, for simplicity, assume t = 3. Let λ be a primitive third root of unity.
We will consider a generalized Taft algebra action on kp [u1 , u2 , u3 ]. Let g = diag(α1 , α2 , α3 ) and assume the
nonzero entries in x are η12 , η23 , η31 . Observe that x is not nilpotent. We have
x · (u1 u2 − p12 u2 u1 ) = η12 (α1 − p12 )u21 + η31 (1 − α2 p12 p23 )u3 u2 ,
x · (u2 u3 − p23 u3 u2 ) = η23 (α2 − p23 )u22 + η12 (1 − α3 p23 p31 )u3 u1 ,
x · (u3 u1 − p31 u1 u3 ) = η31 (α3 − p31 )u23 + η23 (1 − α1 p31 p12 )u2 u1 .
Let α be a primitive ninth root of unity such that λ = α−3 . Set α3 = α, α2 = λα, and α1 = λ2 α. Hence, by
(2.8), (gx − λxg) · ui = 0 for all i. Set p12 = λ2 α, p23 = λα and p31 = α. It now follows that
α2 p12 p23 = (λα)(λ2 α)(λα) = λα3 = 1,
7

and so the first equation above vanishes. One verifies similarly that the remaining equations vanish. Now
we see that (g 3 − 1) · ui = (α3 − 1)ui and x3 · ui = ui . Since α3 = λ−1 6= 1, then we set γ = (α3 − 1)−1 6= 0
and so the above defines an action of Tn (λ, 3, γ) on kp [u1 , u2 , u3 ].
Proposition 3.1 and Lemma 3.6 give some insight into the actions of rank 1 pointed Hopf algebras on
A = kµ [u, v] or Aµ1 (k). Let H = H(G, g, χ, γ) and assume x is nilpotent (for example, when the hypotheses
of Lemma 3.6 (6) are satisfied). We know by [20] that G must be finite and because the elements of G
act diagonally as automorphisms on A, we have that G is abelian. The distinguished element g ∈ G acts
according to Proposition 3.1. Let a ∈ G and assume that η12 6= 0 in x. Then a and x satisfy (2.8) but for
the corresponding χ(a) in place of λ. Then, when a is considered as an element of Aut(A) it takes the form


χ(a)β 0
a=
, β ∈ k× .

We now restrict our study to the subalgebra of H(G, g, χ, 0) that is generated by g and x. Recall that this
is a generalized Taft algebra. We remark that, by Proposition 3.1, an action of Type (a) on kµ [u, v] is the
same as an action of Type (b) on kµ−1 [v, u]. Thus, we will henceforth assume that all actions on a quantum
plane are of Type (a) but will differentiate between the two algebras even though they are isomorphic.
We will assume throughout that all parameters are roots of unity of order at least three. The reason for
this restriction is to avoid getting bogged down in special cases. We will show that there are only two types
of actions. The first is just trivial extensions of actions on quantum planes. In certain cases, there are trivial
extensions of actions on quantum 3-spaces as described below.
Example 3.8. This is a generalization of [14, Example 2.1]. Let A = kp [u1 , u2 , u3 ] such that ord(pij ) > 2
for all i 6= j. Define a linear action of Tn (λ, m, 0), m > 2, on A such that g acts diagonally and the only
nonzero elements of x are η12 , η23 . By (2.8), α1 = λα2 = λ2 α3 . We borrow computations from Example 3.7,
but here η31 = 0. Hence, α1 = p12 and α2 = p23 . Furthermore,
α21 p31 = α1 p31 p12 = 1 = α3 p23 p31 = (λ−2 α1 )(λ−1 α1 )p31 .
This implies that λ3 = 1 and that p13 = α21 .
Given a quantum affine space A = kp [u1 , . . . , ut ], we say T = Tn (λ, m, 0) acts as a trivial extension of an
action on the quantum affine 3-space subalgebra Aijk if the action is as given in Example 3.8. That is, g
acts diagonally on A, x · uj = ηij ui , x · uk = ηjk uj , and x · uℓ = 0 for all ℓ 6= j, k.
We remark briefly that Example 3.8 does not extend beyond the t = 3 case. For example, suppose
Tn (λ, m, 0), m > 2, acts on A = kp [u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 ], ord(pij ) > 2 for all i 6= j. If g acts diagonally and x acts
by
x · u1 = 0, x · u2 = η12 u1 , x · u3 = η23 u2 , x · u4 = η34 u4 ,
then η12 η34 = 0 by Lemma 3.6 (4).
Theorem 3.9. Suppose Tn (λ, m, 0) acts linearly and inner faithfully on A = kp [u1 , u2 , · · · , ut ]. Assume m,
t, and ord(pij ) for i 6= j are all at least 3. Then every action is a trivial extension of an action on some Aij
or Aijk .
Proof. By Lemma 3.2, g acts diagonally on A. If x 6= 0, then after a change of variable we may assume that
η12 6= 0. By Lemma 3.6, this implies that the only other possible nonzero entries may be η23 and η31 . If
they are all nonzero then we are in the situation of Example 3.7, whence x is not nilpotent, a contradiction.
On the other hand, if η23 = η31 = 0, then the action is a trivial extension of an action on a quantum plane.
Finally, if exactly one of η23 or η31 is nonzero, then we are in the setting of Example 3.8.

Next we aim to understand actions of B(G, g, χ) on quantum affine spaces. Our primary goal will be to
determine the maximum rank of such a B and we do this by determining how to “patch” together actions
of generalized Taft algebras.
By Lemma 3.2, we may assume that all of the gi act diagonally. In light of Theorem 3.9, we may assume
that x1 = (ηij ) has nonzero entry η12 and at most one other nonzero entry, either η23 or η31 . After a change
of variable, we may assume in either of the latter cases that η12 , η23 6= 0.
We begin by considering the above question for actions on quantum planes and quantum Weyl algebras.
8

Lemma 3.10. Suppose B(G, g, χ) has rank θ, and that B acts linearly and inner faithfully on A = kµ [u, v]
or Aµ1 (k). Assume ord(µ) and mi for all i are at least 3. Then
(1) ord(µ) | ni and Bi acts on A according to Proposition 3.1 for each i = 1, . . . , θ;
(2) either all Bi act according to Proposition 3.1 (a) or all act according to Proposition 3.1 (b);
(3) for all i 6= j, we have λi = χj (gi ).
Proof. Suppose B acts linearly on A such that xi · A 6= 0. Since Bi ∼
= Tni (λi , mi , 0) as Hopf algebras, then
Bi acts linearly on A and xi · A 6= 0. Thus, the conditions in Proposition 3.1 are necessary and the action is
the one given in that result. It follows that ord(µ) | ni for each i. We will show that all the Bi act according
to (a) or (b).
Without loss of generality, suppose x1 acts on A according to (a) and x2 acts according to (b), then
(x1 x2 − χ2 (g1 )x2 x1 ) · v = 0 − χ2 (g1 )(x2 · (η1 u)) = −η1 η2 χ2 (g1 )v 6= 0,
a contradiction. Hence, after a linear change of variable we may assume that each Bi acts according to (a).
For j = 1, 2, we write xj · v = ηj u, ηj ∈ k× . If i 6= j, then
−1
(gi xj − χj (gi )xj gi ) · v = gi · (ηj u) − χj (gi )(xj · (λ−1
i µv)) = ηj µ(1 − χj (gi )λi )u.

Thus, λi = χj (gi ).



We now proceed to study quantum affine spaces in general.
Lemma 3.11. Suppose B(G, g, χ) has rank θ, and that B acts linearly and inner faithfully on A = kµ [u, v]
or Aµ1 (k). Assume ord(µ) and mi for all i are at least 3. Then θ ≤ 2, and if θ = 2, then there exists a
primitive mth root of unity ω such that χ1 (g1 ) = χ2 (g1 ) = ω and χ1 (g2 ) = χ2 (g2 ) = ω −1 .
Proof. The case θ = 1 is handled by Proposition 3.1. Suppose θ = 2 and set λ1 = χ1 (g1 ) = ω. By Lemma
3.10 (3), χ2 (g1 ) = λ1 = ω. Moreover, the relations of B imply that χ1 (g2 ) = χ2 (g1 )−1 = ω −1 . Applying
Lemma 3.10 (3) again, we have λ2 = χ2 (g2 ) = χ2 (g1 )−1 = ω −1 .
Now suppose θ ≥ 3. Using the same logic as above we have χ2 (g3 ) = χ3 (g2 )−1 = ω. But then
ω = χ2 (g3 ) = χ1 (g3 ) = χ3 (g1 )−1 = χ1 (g1 )−1 = ω −1 .
Thus, 2 ≥ ord(ω) = ord(λ1 ), contradicting our hypothesis.



Lemma 3.12. Suppose B(G, g, χ) has rank θ ≥ 2, and that B acts linearly and inner faithfully on A =
kp [u1 , . . . , ut ]. Assume t, mi for all i, and ord(pij ) for all i 6= j are at least 3. Write x1 = (ηij ) and
x2 = (µij ).
(1) If ηij , µjk 6= 0, then k 6= i and both B1 and B2 act as trivial extensions of an action on Aijk .
(2) If ηij , µkj 6= 0, then λ1 = λ−1
2 .
(3) There may be at most two xi with nonzero entries in the same column.
Proof. (1) Assume ηij , µjk 6= 0.
First, suppose k = i. If x1 · ui = 0, then 0 = (x1 x2 − χ2 (g1 )x2 x1 ) · ui = µji ηij ui , a contradiction. By
Lemma 3.6 (1, 2), there is some ℓ 6= i, j such that x1 · ui = ηℓi uℓ . Similarly, we must have x2 · uℓ 6= 0, so by
Lemma 3.6 (1, 3), there is some m such that x2 · uℓ = µmℓ um . From this, and through similar computations
for the second, we have
0 = (x1 x2 − χ2 (g1 )x2 x1 ) · ui = µji ηij ui − χ2 (g1 )ηℓi µmℓ um ,
0 = (x1 x2 − χ2 (g1 )x2 x1 ) · uj = µℓ′ j ηm′ ℓ′ um′ − χ2 (g1 )ηij µji uj .
By the assumption that µji ηij 6= 0, we must have that m = i and m′ = j. Since ηℓi , ηjℓ′ 6= 0, we cannot
have i, j, ℓ, ℓ′ all distinct by Lemma 3.6 (4). This forces ℓ = ℓ′ , but then x1 is not nilpotent. We conclude
that k 6= i.
In general, for k 6= i, the same argument shows that there exists ℓ 6= i, k such that ηℓk , µiℓ 6= 0 and by
Lemma 3.6 (4), we cannot have i, j, k, ℓ all distinct, so ℓ = j.
(2) Assume ηij , µkj 6= 0. We write g1 · ui = αi ui and g2 · ui = βi ui for all i. If k = i, then
0 = (g2 x1 − χ1 (g2 )x1 g2 ) · uj = ηij (βi − χ1 (g2 )βj )ui ,
0 = (g1 x2 − χ2 (g1 )x2 g1 ) · uj = µij (αi − χ2 (g1 )αj )ui .
9

By (2.8), αi = λ1 αj and βi = λ2 βj . Hence, λ1 = χ2 (g1 ) and λ2 = χ1 (g2 ), and the result follows.
Next suppose that k 6= i. Then the coefficient of uk ui in x1 · (uj uk − pjk uk uj ) is ηij (pik − pjk αk ) and in
x2 · (ui uj − pij uj ui ) it is µkj (βi pik − pij ). Thus, αk = pik pkj and βi = pij pki . Now
(g2 x1 − χ1 (g2 )x1 g2 ) · uj = ηij (βi − χ1 (g2 )βj )ui ,
(g1 x2 − χ2 (g1 )x2 g1 ) · uj = µjk (αk − χ2 (g1 )αj )uk .
−1
By Proposition 3.1, αj = λ−1
1 pij and βj = λ2 pkj , so χ1 (g2 ) = λ2 βi pjk and χ2 (g1 ) = λ1 αk pji . Now

1 = χ2 (g1 )χ1 (g2 ) = λ2 βi pjk λ1 αk pji = λ1 λ2 (pij pki )(pik pkj )(pjk pji ) = λ1 λ2 ,
as claimed.
(3) Suppose three xi , say i = 1, 2, 3, have nonzero entries in the same column. Then by (2), we would

2
have λ1 = λ−1

2 , λ1 = λ3 , and λ2 = λ3 , whence λ3 = 1, a contradiction.
The following result is proved for t = 2 in Lemma 3.11.
Theorem 3.13. Suppose B = B(G, g, χ) has rank θ, and that B acts linearly and inner faithfully on
A = kp [u1 , . . . , ut ], t ≥ 2. Assume mi for all i and ord(pij ) for all i 6= j are at least 3. Then θ ≤ 2(t − 1).
Proof. Let Γ be a directed graph with t vertices v1 , . . . , vt corresponding to the generators of A. We draw
an arrow from vj to vi if the (i, j) entry of some xk is nonzero. Let Γ1 denote the number of arrows in Γ. It
is clear that θ ≤ Γ1 .
By Lemma 3.12 (3), a vertex may not be the source of more than two arrows, and so Γ1 ≤ 2t. Lemma
3.12 (1) implies that Γ contains no two cycles, and if there is a path of length two, then some Bℓ acts as a
trivial extension of some Aijk . That is, two arrows correspond to the same action. Now if Γ1 ≤ 2t − 2, we
are done, since θ ≤ Γ1 . If Γ1 = 2t − 1, then the target of any arrow is the source of at least one other, giving
a path of length 2. Hence, θ ≤ Γ1 − 1 = 2t − 2. If Γ1 = 2t, then the target of any arrow is the source of two
others, giving two paths of length 2. Hence, θ ≤ Γ1 − 2 = 2t − 2.

Lemma 3.11 shows that the bound in Theorem 3.13 is sharp when t = 2. The next example shows this
for t > 2.
Example 3.14. Let A = kp [u1 , . . . , ut ], with t and ord(pij ) for i 6= j all at least 3. We will construct an
action of some B(G, g, χ) of rank 2(t − 1) on A.
First, let Bk ∼
= Tnk (λk , mk ), k = 1, . . . , t − 1, have canonical generators {gk , xk }. We will assume Bk acts
as a trivial extension of an action on A1(k+1) with gk · ui = αki ui for some αki ∈ k× and xk · uk+1 = u1 . By
definition, xk · ui = 0 for all i 6= k + 1. By Proposition 3.1 we must have αi1 = p1(i+1) . Furthermore, for
i 6= j,
(3.15)

xi · (ui+1 uj+1 − p(i+1)(j+1) uj+1 ui+1 ) = (p1(j+1) − p(i+1)(j+1) αi(j+1) )uj+1 u1 ,
(gi xj − χj (gi )xj gi ) · uj+1 = (αi1 − χj (gi )αi(j+1) )u1 .

Hence, we have
−1
−1
−1
χj (gi )χi (gj ) = (αi1 α−1
p1(j+1) (p1(i+1) p(i+1)(j+1) )−1 = 1.
i(j+1) )(αj1 αj(i+1) ) = p1(i+1) (p1(j+1) p(i+1)(j+1) )

It follows that all compatibility conditions are met amongst the {gk , xk }.
′
In a similar way, set Bk−t+1
= Bk ∼
= Tnk (λ−1
k , mk ), k = t, . . . , 2t − 2 and denote the canonical generators
′
′
′
by {gk , xk }. We will assume Bk acts as a trivial extension of an action on A1(k+1) with gk′ · ui = βki ui for
some βki ∈ k× and x′k · uk+1 = u1 with x′k · ui = 0 for all i 6= k + 1. The argument above shows that the
compatibility conditions amongst the Bk′ are met. It remains to show that the Bk and the Bk′ are pairwise
compatible. We have
(gi x′j − χ′j (gi )x′j gi ) · uj+1 = (αi1 − χ′j (gi )αi(j+1) )u1
(gj′ xi − χi (gj′ )xi gj′ ) · ui+1 = (βj1 − χi (gj′ )βj(i+1) )u1 .
A computation as in (3.15) shows that βij = αij for all i, j. Thus, we have
−1
−1
−1
χ′j (gi )χi (gj′ ) = αi1 α−1
i(j+1) βj1 βj(i+1) = αi1 αi(j+1) αj1 αj(i+1) = 1.

4. Quantum Matrix Algebras
We want to classify actions of Tn (λ, m, 0) on Oq (M2 (k)) with x acting linearly and nonzero. To do this,
we first note some automorphisms of Oq (MN (k)). First, let H denote the group (k× )2N −1 . Each element
(a1 , . . . , aN , b1 , . . . , bN −1 ) of H gives a unique automorphism of Oq (MN (k)) by
(
ai bj Yij , (j < N )
Yij 7→
ai Yij ,
(j = N ).
Equivalently, if αij ∈ k is defined by g · Yij = αij Yij , then the matrix (αij ) forms an N × N matrix of rank
1 with no zero entries. For example, if N = 2 and g ∈ H, then
g · A = α11 A

g · B = α12 B

g · C = α21 C

g · D = α22 D,

for αij ∈ k× .
The transposition map, τ , given by Yij 7→ Yji , gives another automorphism of Oq (MN (k)). It was
conjectured in [21] that if q is not a root of unity, then Aut(Oq (MN (k))) ∼
= H ⋊ hτ i, and this conjecture was
proven in its entirety in [27].
Remark 4.1. Note that if h · a denotes an action of a Hopf algebra H on an associative k-algebra A,
and φ : A −→ B is a k-algebra isomorphism, then h ◦ b := φ(h · φ−1 (b)) gives an action of H on B.
We will use this fact frequently, with either φ = τ or φ : Oq (MN (k)) −→ Oq−1 (MN (k)) being the map
Yij 7→ Y(N +1−i)(N +1−j) .
Lemma 4.2. Let q 6= ±1 and assume m ≥ 3. If Tn (λ, m, 0) acts on Oq (M2 (k)) with x acting linearly and
nonzero, and g acting as an element of H ⋊ hτ i, then g must act as an element of H, i.e. diagonally on the
basis (A, B, C, D) of Oq (M2 (k))(1) .
Proof. Let (ηij ) give the action of x on the generators, i.e. (ηij ) is the matrix representing the action of x
on the basis (A, B, C, D) of the 1-graded piece.
Suppose g does not act as an element of H, so by the assumption that g ∈ H ⋊ hτ i,
g · A = α11 A

g · B = α21 C

g · C = α12 B

g · D = α22 D,

for (αij )i,j a rank one matrix with no zero entries. On the ordered basis (A, B, C, D), we have that gx − λxg
is given by


η11 α11 (1 − λ)
(η12 α11 − λη13 α21 ) η13 α11 − λη12 α12 η14 (α11 − λα22 )
 η31 α12 − λη21 α11 η32 α12 − λη23 α21
α12 (η33 − λη22 ) η34 α12 − λη24 α22 

.
 η21 α21 − λη31 α11

η41 (α22 − λα11 )
η42 α22 − λη43 α21 η43 α22 − λη42 α12
η44 α22 (1 − λ)

Since this must be the zero matrix, we have that η11 = η44 = 0. Moreover, the following pairs are either
both zero or both nonzero:
(η12 , η13 ),

(η21 , η31 ),

(η22 , η33 ),

(η23 , η32 ),

(η24 , η34 ),

(η42 , η43 ).

If η23 6= 0, then η32 = λα
α12 η23 and η23 = α21 η32 . Therefore, λ = 1, a contradiction to m 6= 2. Hence,
η23 = η32 = 0. Similarly, we have η22 = η33 = 0. Now note that (A2 , AB, AC, AD, B 2 , BC, BD, C 2 , CD, D2 )
is a basis for Oq (M2 (k))2 . The B 2 coefficient of x · (AB − qBA) is η21 . Thus, η21 = η31 = 0. The BD
coefficient is η41 q −1 , so η41 = 0 as well, giving x · A = 0. The BC coefficient is now (q 2 − 1)η42 . Since q 2 6= 1,
we have η42 = η43 = 0. The coefficients of AB, B 2 , and BC in x · (BD − qDB) are, respectively, −qη14 ,
−qη24 , and α12 η24 + (q 2 − 1)α22 η12 − qη34 . Thus, as above, we get that η14 = η24 = η34 = η12 = η13 = 0.
Therefore, x acts by zero, a contradiction.

Before classifying linear actions of Tn (λ, m, 0) on Oq (M2 (k)) in general, we consider a special case.
Example 4.3. Let q ∈ k with ord(q) = 3. Also assume that m ≥ 3. The following give actions of Tn (λ, m, 0)
on Oq (M2 (k)). (The action of g is specified as an element of H, i.e. a matrix of rank one (αij )i,j so that

Proposition 4.4. Let q 6= ±1 and assume m ≥ 3. Then Tn (λ, m, 0) acts on Oq (M2 (k)) with x acting
linearly and nonzero, and g acting as an element of H ⋊ hτ i, if and only if
• λ = q ±2 and ord(q)|n, or
• λ = q ±4 and ord(q 2 )|n.
The actions are given as in Example 4.3 (with γ, δ, ǫ not all zero) and Table 4.1.
Noting that Oq (M2 (k)) ∼
= Oq−1 (M2 (k)) via A 7→ D, B 7→ C, C 7→ B, D 7→ A, we see that by changing
q, we can assume that λ = q 2 or λ = q 4 , with the action coming from the corresponding list.
Table 4.1. Actions of Tn (λ, m, 0) on Oq (M2 (k)). The second column lists the value of λ
in terms of q while the third indicates the action of g as an element of H, i.e. a matrix of
rank one (αij )i,j so that g · Yij = αij Yij . The fourth column indicates how x acts on the
generators with δ, ǫ ∈ k. We assume the action is trivial if not listed and the last column
lists any restrictions on δ and ǫ.

Proof of Proposition 4.4. It is straightforward to check that each item in Table 4.1 indeed gives an action of
Tn (λ, m, 0) on Oq (M2 (k)). Now assume we have an action with g and x acting according to the hypotheses.
We show that this action is one of those listed above. Let (ηij ) give the action of x on the generators, i.e.
(ηij ) is the matrix representing the action of x on the basis (A, B, C, D) of the 1-graded piece.
By Lemma 4.2, we have that g must act as an element of H, i.e. diagonally. Thus, by Lemma 2.7, we
have ηij ηji = 0 for all i, j, and in particular, each ηii = 0. Moreover, the coefficients of B 2 and C 2 in
x · (AD − DA − (q − q −1 )BC) are, respectively, (q −1 − q)α12 η23 and (q −1 − q)η32 . Hence, η23 = η32 = 0.
By Remark 4.1, we can assume x · A 6= 0 or x · B 6= 0: If x · C 6= 0, we can consider instead the action on
Oq (M2 (k)) from Remark 4.1 with φ = τ , in which x · B 6= 0. If, on the other hand, x · D 6= 0, we can consider
the action on Oq−1 (M2 (k)) with φ = A 7→ D, B 7→ C, C 7→ B, D 7→ A, in which x · A 6= 0. First, suppose
α11
. Also,
x · B 6= 0, so η12 6= 0 or η42 6= 0. By Remark 4.1 again, we can assume η12 6= 0. Then by (2.8), λ = α
12
2
since the coefficient of A in x · (AB − qBA) is η12 (α11 − q), we get that α11 = q. Similarly, the coefficient
of AC in x · (BC − CB) is η12 (1 − q −1 α21 ), so α21 = q. Finally, the coefficient of AD in x · (BD − qDB) is
12

2
11
η12 (1 − qα22 ), so α22 = q −1 . Using the fact that g has rank one, we have α12 = q −1 as well and λ = α
α12 = q .
2
2
Since we also assume λ 6= 1, by (2.8), we have η13 = η21 = η24 = η31 = η41 = η42 = η43 = 0. The A and AC
coefficients of x · (AD − DA − (q − q −1 )BC) are, respectively, η14 (α11 − 1) and η34 (α11 − q −1 ) − (q − q −1 )η12 .
This yields η14 = 0 and η34 = η12 . Thus, g and x act according to the first case of λ = q 2 in Table 4.1.
Without loss of generality, we can now assume x · B = x · C = 0 and x · A 6= 0, so at least one of
2
22
η21 , η31 , and η41 must be nonzero. Suppose that η41 6= 0. Then by (2.8), λ = α
α11 . The coefficients of D
in x · (AD − DA − (q − q −1 )BC), CD in x · (AC − qCA), and BD in x · (AB − qBA) are, respectively,
η41 (1 − α22 ), η41 (q −1 − qα21 ) and η41 (q −1 − qα12 ). Thus, we have α12 = α21 = q −2 , α22 = 1, and by the fact
that g has rank one as a matrix in H, we have α11 = q −4 and λ = q 4 . From (2.8) and our assumptions that
q 2 6= 1 and λ2 6= 1, we then know η21 = η31 = η14 = 0. The B 2 coefficient of x · (BD − qDB) and the C 2
coefficient of x · (CD − qDC) are respectively η24 (q −2 − q) and η34 (q −2 − q). If q 3 6= 1, we have η24 = η34 = 0,
in which case x · D = 0 and x · A = η41 D, so g and x act according to the case λ = q 4 in Table 4.1. If on the
other hand, q 3 = 1, then g and x act according to Example 4.3 (2).
Now assume x · B = x · C = 0, and x · A = η21 B + η31 C 6= 0. Moreover, by the above paragraph and
α12
Remark 4.1, we can assume η14 = 0. In the case η21 6= 0, by (2.8), λ = α
. Also, the B 2 coefficient of
11
x · (AB − qBA), the BC coefficient of x · (AC − qCA), and the BD coefficient of x · (AD − DA − (q − q −1)BC)
are, respectively, η21 (1 − qα12 ), η21 (1 − qα21 ), and η21 (1 − q −1 α22 ). Hence, we have α12 = α21 = q −1 and
α22 = q. By the fact that g has rank 1, we also have α11 = q −3 and hence that λ = q 2 . We obtain the same
result in the case η31 6= 0. Also, in either case, (2.8) yields η24 = η34 = 0, so g and x act according to the
final case of λ = q 2 in Table 4.1.


Corollary 4.5. Let q 6= ±1 and assume m ≥ 3. Then Tn (λ, m, 0) acts inner faithfully on Oq (M2 (k)) with
x acting linearly and nonzero, and g acting as an element of H ⋊ hτ i, if and only if
• λ = q ±2 and ord(q) = n, or
• λ = q ±4 and ord(q 2 ) = n.
It is possible to “patch” the actions of Proposition 4.4 together to get actions of bosonizations of higher
rank quantum linear spaces.
Example 4.6. Let q ∈ k be a fifth root of unity and let G = (Z5 )3 with generators g1 , g2 , g3 . Also, let
b be defined by
χ1 , χ2 , χ3 ∈ G
(4.7)

χ1 (g1 ) = q 2 , χ1 (g2 ) = 1, χ1 (g3 ) = q −2 ,
χ2 (g1 ) = 1, χ2 (g2 ) = q 2 , χ2 (g3 ) = q −2 ,
χ3 (g1 ) = q 2 , χ3 (g2 ) = q 2 , χ3 (g3 ) = q −4 .

Note that χ and g satisfy the necessary conditions to form a quantum linear space R(g, χ). The bosonization
of this quantum linear space with the group algebra kG, namely B(G, g, χ), is generated by grouplike elements
{g1 , g2 , g3 } and (gi , 1)-skew primitive elements xi subject to the relations of G and
gi xj = χj (gi )xj gi ,

xi xj = χj (g1 )xj xi .

There is an action of B(G, g, χ) on Oq (M2 (k)) specified by
(1) B1 ∼
= T5 (q 2 , 5, 0) acts as in Table 4.1 (1) with δ1 ∈ k× arbitrary,
(2) B2 ∼
= T5 (q 2 , 5, 0) acts as in Table 4.1 (2) with δ2 ∈ k× arbitrary, and
(3) B3 ∼
= T5 (q 4 , 5, 0) acts as in Table 4.1 (8) with δ3 ∈ k× arbitrary.
To see that this indeed defines an action, we need only verify that gi xj − χj (gi )xj gi and xi xj − χj (g1 )xj xi
act by zero for i 6= j. Representing these elements as matrices on the basis (A, B, C, D) of Oq (M2 (k))1 , one
easily verifies that these matrices satisfy the necessary relations.
We show in the next theorem that this is the most “patching” that can be done for such actions.
Theorem 4.8. Let q 6= ±1. Also, let B(G, g, χ) be a bosonization of rank θ with mi 6= 2 for all i. Suppose
B(G, g, χ) acts on Oq (M2 (k)) with each gi acting as an element of H ⋊ hτ i and each xi acting linearly and
nonzero. Then, θ ≤ 3.

Proof. By Proposition 4.4, each Bi must act by one of the eight actions of Table 4.1 (or the two actions of
Example 4.3 in the case that ord(q) = 3). Conditions for compatibility of the actions from Table 4.1 are
specified in Table 4.2, the contents of which follow from basic computations. The table must be symmetric
of course (after switching i ↔ j). Also, Remark 4.1 minimizes the calculations needed.
For the actions of Example 4.3, note that if γ = 0 or δ = ǫ = 0, the action reduces to one of those in
Table 4.1. Thus, for the sake of finding compatibility of actions, we can assume for each of those that γ 6= 0
and at least one of δ, ǫ is nonzero. Simple calculations show that the first is compatible only with action (6)
from the table, while the second action is only compatible with (3). Thus, since we want to show θ ≤ 3, we
need not consider these cases any longer and focus solely on those actions in Table 4.1.
We now use Table 4.2 to show that θ ≤ 3. We construct an undirected graph with eight vertices corresponding to the action “types” in Table 4.2 and exactly one edge between vertices if there is a compatible
action between those two types. If there is no compatible action, we draw no edge between those two vertices.
This gives the following.

An action of rank 1 corresponds to a vertex. A possible action of rank 2 corresponds to an edge (assuming
the compatibility conditions of Table 4.2 are satisfied). A possible action of rank 3 corresponds to a triangle,
but not all triangles are valid. A possible action of rank 4 corresponds to a K4 subgraph and there are only
two of these in the graph. One has vertices (1), (2), (6), (8) and the other has vertices (3), (4), (5), (7). We
note that ruling out just one of these cases will suffice by Remark 4.1.

Suppose a rank 4 bosonization B acts on Oq (M2 (k)) with B1 , B2 , B3 , and B4 acting as (1), (2), (6), and
(8) respectively. Then using Table 4.2, we must have δ3 = ǫ3 = 0, since the action of B3 must be compatible
with both the action of B1 and B2 . In that case, x3 acts by zero, a contradiction. This shows there are no
rank 4 actions and hence the highest rank of B is 3.

We now turn our attention to the more difficult case of Oq (MN (k)) with N ≥ 3.
Lemma 4.9. Let q 6= ±1 and N, m ≥ 3. If Tn (λ, m, 0) acts on Oq (MN (k)) with x acting linearly and
nonzero, and g acting as an element of H ⋊ hτ i, then g must act as an element of H, i.e. diagonally on the
basis (Yi,j ) of Oq (MN (k)).

Yij coefficient of a term using this basis. Suppose g does not act as an element of H, so it must act as
g · Yij = αij Yji for αij ∈ k× . We will show that x must act by zero. We have that

Proposition 4.11. Let q 6= ±1 and N, m ≥ 3. Then Tn (λ, m, 0) acts on Oq (MN (k)) with x acting linearly
and nonzero, and g acting as an element of H ⋊ hτ i, if and only if λ = q ±2 and ord(q) | n. The actions are
given by Table 4.3.
Proof. Again, it is straightforward to check that each of the rows in Table 4.3 defines an action on Oq (MN (k)).
By Lemma 4.9, we have that g must act diagonally. For convenience, we

will often refer to the Yij coefficient of a term using this basis.
We will say Yab and Yij form an AD pair if a < i and b < j. We say that Yab and Yij form a BC pair if
a < i and b > j, and similarly for other pairs of generators from Oq (M2 (k)).
Fix a BC pair, (i, j) and (k, ℓ). Then the coefficient of Yij2 in x · (Yiℓ Ykj − Ykj Yiℓ − (q − q −1 )Yij Ykℓ ) is

Assume ηab
6= 0 for some (a, b) 6= (c, d) ∈ N 2 . Choose (i, j) such that

• (a, b) and (i, j) form any pair besides AD or DA, so Yab Yij = γYij Yab for γ ∈ k× , and
• (c, d) and (i, j) form any pair besides BC or CB, or altenatively, (c, d) = (i, j).
Then the coefficient of Ycd Yij

in x · (Yab Yij − γYij Yab ) is ηab
(1 − γαij qb), where

(c, d) and (i, j) form an AD or DA pair, or (c, d) = (i, j)
(c, d) and (i, j) form a BA or CA pair
(c, d) and (i, j) form an AB or AC pair,
(a, b) and (i, j) form a BC or CB pair
(a, b) and (i, j) form an AB or AC pair
(a, b) and (i, j) form a BA or CA pair.

cd
Thus, since ηab
6= 0, we have

αij = (γb
q )−1 .

(4.15)

On the other hand, if (i, j) is selected so that it forms the same pair with both (a, b) and (c, d), an AD, DA,
ij
BC, or CB pair, then the coefficient of Yij Ycd in x · (Yij Yab − Yab Yij − γYib Yaj ) is ηab
(αij − 1). Thus, in this
case,
(4.16)

αij = 1.

Now suppose x · Yab 6= 0 for some 1 < a, b < N . By Remark 4.1, we can assume without loss of generality
a,b−1
that ηab
6= 0. By (4.12), (4.15), (4.16), and the fact that g has rank one, we get that g is as in the first
case of λ = q 2 with b < N . To see that x must act as specified, first consider c < a. The coefficient of
a(b−1)
c(b−1)
Yc(b−1) Ya(b−1) in x · (Yc(b−1) Yab − Yab Yc(b−1) − (q − q −1 )Ycb Ya(b−1) ) is (αc(b−1) − q −1 )ηab
− (q − q −1 )ηcb
.
c(b−1)
a(b−1)
Thus, since αc(b−1) = q, we have ηcb

x · (Yab Ycb − qYcb Yab ) is (q −1 − q)(ηcb
− ηab
). Thus, in this case also, ηcb
= ηab
. That all other
η coefficients must be zero follows from Figure 4.4, (4.12), and our knowledge of g.
From now on, we assume x · Yab = 0 for all 1 < a, b < n. We proceed by assuming that x · Yab 6= 0 for some
(a, b) matching the red square in the remaining three cases of Figure 4.4 By Remark 4.1, this is sufficient.

Fix 1 < b < N and suppose x·Y1b 6= 0. Since η2b

−1
2d
x · (Y1b Y1d − qY1d Y1b ) is η1b (1 − qα1d ), giving that α1d = q . Also, since η2b = 0, the coefficient of
1d
Y1d Y2b in x · (Y1b Y2b − qY2b Y1b ) is η1b
(1 − qα2b ), so α2b = q −1 . By (4.15) and (4.16) respectively, we know
1d
α11 = α21 = 1. Thus, since g has rank one, we have α1b = q −1 . But then, by (4.12), since η1b
6= 0, we
1d
have λ = 1, a contradiction. Thus, η1b = 0 for all d > b. By the second case of Figure 4.4, we must have
x · Y1b = δY2b for some nonzero δ ∈ k. By (4.15), (4.16), and the fact that g has rank one, we get that g is
as in the second case of λ = q −2 with a = 1. To see that x must act as specified, first consider d < b. The

η1N

x · Yab = 0 for all (a, b) ∈
/ {(1, 1), (N, N )}.
Assume x · Y11 6= 0. Since N > 2, the coefficient of Y2N YN 2 in x · (Y11 YN N − YN N Y11 − (q − q −1 )Y1N YN 1 )

Suppose η11 6= 0. Then for 1 < a, the coefficient of Y1N YaN in x · (Y11 YaN − YaN Y11 − (q − q −1 )Y1N Ya1 ) is
1N
(1 − αaN q −1 ). Thus, αaN = q for 1 < a. Similarly, we see that αa1 = q −1 for 1 < a. From the above
η11
calculations, as well as (4.15), we see that g is as in the third case of λ = q 2 . The coefficient of Y21 YN 1 in

x · (Y11 Y21 − qY21 Y11 ) is η11
(q − 1), so η11

If instead of η11 6= 0, we have η11 6= 0, this case reduces to the above by Remark 4.1. This exhausts all
possibilities of nonzero actions of x.

As in the case N = 2, it is possible to “patch” the actions of Proposition 4.11 together to get actions of
bosonizations of higher rank quantum linear spaces.

Note that χ and g satisfy the necessary conditions to form a quantum linear space R(g, χ). Let B(G, g, χ)
be the bosonization R#kG. If N is odd, there is an action of B(G, g, χ) on Oq (MN (k)) specified by
(a) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N 2−1 , we have Bi ∼

arbitrary,

(b) for N 2−1 < i ≤ N −1, we have Bi ∼

and δi ∈ k× arbitrary,
(c) for N − 1 < i ≤ 3(N2−1) , we have Bi ∼
= T5 (q −2 , 5, 0) acts as in (5) of Proposition 4.11 with bi =

2(i − N + 1) and δi ∈ k arbitrary, and

= T5 (q −2 , 5, 0) acts as in (6) of Proposition 4.11 with
ai = 2(i − 3(N2−1) ) and δi ∈ k× arbitrary.

On the other hand, if N is even, the action is specified by
(a) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N2 , we have Bi ∼
= T5 (q 2 , 5, 0) acts as in (1) of Proposition 4.11 with bi = 2i and δi ∈ k×
arbitrary,

(b) for N2 < i ≤ N , we have Bi ∼

δi ∈ k× arbitrary,
18

(c) for N < i ≤ N + N2−2 , we have Bi ∼

N −2
×
ai = 2(i − N − 2 ) and δi ∈ k arbitrary.
In either case, to see that this indeed defines an action, we need only verify that gi xj − χj (gi )xj gi and
xi xj − χj (gi )xj xi act by zero for i 6= j.
As for the case N = 2 (Theorem 4.8), the above examples give the most “patching” that can be done for
such actions.
Theorem 4.18. Let q 6= ±1. Also, let B(G, g, χ) be a bosonization of rank θ with mi 6= 2 for all i. Suppose
B(G, g, χ) acts on Oq (MN (k)) for N ≥ 3 with each gi acting as an element of H ⋊ hτ i and each xi acting
linearly and nonzero. Then, θ ≤ 2N − 2.
Proof. By Proposition 4.11, each Bi must act by one of the eight actions specified therein. Conditions for
compatibility of actions of Bi and Bj (i 6= j) are specified in Table 4.5, the contents of which follow from
basic computations. The table must be symmetric of course (after switching i ↔ j and ζ ↔ ζ −1 ). Also,
Remark 4.1 minimizes the calculations needed.
We now use Table 4.5 to show that θ ≤ 2N − 2. First, note that if more than one Bi act as (1) (or (2), (5),
or (6)), then the b-values (or a-values for (2) and (6)) of the corresponding actions must be at least 2 apart.
Second, note that if a Bi acts as (1) and another acts as (5), then the b-value for (1) cannot be exactly one
more than the b-value for (5). Similarly, the a-value for any (2) cannot be one more than the a-value for
any (6). Finally, note that if one of the Bi acts as (3), (4), (7), or (8), then without loss of generality, using
Remark 4.1, we can assume i = 1 and it acts as (3). By Table 4.5, no other Bi can act as (3) or (4). Also,
one of the Bi could act as (7) or (8), but not both. Thus, we consider four cases: B1 acts as (3) and B2 acts
as (7), B1 acts as (3) and B2 acts as (8), B1 acts as (3) with none of the Bi acting as (7) or (8), and none
of the Bi act as (3), (4), (7), or (8).
Case 1: B1 acts as (3) and B2 acts as (7): In this case, any Bi acting as (1), (2), (5), or (6) must satisfy
the following, respectively:
3 ≤ b ≤ N − 1,

3 ≤ a ≤ N,

1 ≤ b ≤ N − 2,

2 ≤ a ≤ N − 2.

If N is even, we can have Bi acting as
(1) with b = 3, 5, . . . , N − 1,
(5) with b = 1, 3, . . . , N − 3,

(2) with a = 4, 6, . . . , N,
(6) with a = 2, 4, . . . , N − 2.

Thus, including the actions of B1 as (3) and B2 as (7), the largest θ could be is 2 + 4

5. Additional results
In this section, we consider invariants of actions on quantum planes, and actions on further families of
algebras related to quantum affine spaces and quantum matrix algebras.
5.1. Invariants. We study invariants of some of the actions explored above. Recall that for a Hopf algebra
H and an H-module algebra A, the ring of invariants is defined as AH = {a ∈ A | h · a = ε(h)a}. It is clear
that for a generalized Taft algebra T = Tn (λ, m, 0), AT = Ahgi ∩ Ahxi and for B = B(G, g, χ) of rank θ,
AB = ∩θi=1 ABi .
A connected (N)-graded algebra A is said to be Artin-Schelter (AS) regular if it has finite Gelfand-Kirillov
dimension, finite global dimension d, ExtdA (k) ∼
= k, and ExtiA (k) = 0 for i 6= d. Furthermore, a noetherian,
regular graded domain A of dimension d with Hilbert series HA (t) = (1 − t)−n is a quantum polynomial ring.
It is well-known that the algebras Oq (MN (k)) and kq [u1 , . . . , uN ] are quantum polynomial rings.
Lemma 5.1. Assume T = Tn (λ, m, 0), m > 2, acts linearly and inner faithfully on A = kp [u1 , u2 , · · · , ut ]
such that ord(pij ) > 2 for all i 6= j and x · A 6= 0. If T acts as a trivial extension of A12 , then Ahxi =
′
m
′
m
′
kp′ [u1 , um
2 , u3 , . . . , ut ] where pi2 = pi2 (so p2i = p2i also) and pij = pij when i 6= 2 and j 6= 2.
Proof. By [14, Lemma 2.1] and Proposition 3.1 we have
x · (ui11 ui22 · · · uitt ) = (x · (ui11 ui22 ))ui33 · · · uitt = η12 [i2 ]λ−1 αi11 ui11 +1 ui22 −1 ui33 · · · uitt .
Thus, x · (ui11 ui22 · · · uitt ) = 0 if and only if i2 ∼
= 0 mod m and Ahxi is as claimed.



It is clear that be above lemma generalizes to T acting as a trivial extension of any Aij by a simple change
of variable.
Let A be a connected graded algebra and G a finite subgroup of finite automorphisms. The trace series
of g ∈ G is defined as
X

TrA (g, t) =
trace g|Ai ti .

The trace series was defined by Jing and Zhang [15, 16]. For our purposes, it suffices to recall the following.
Let (x1 , . . . , xn ) be a normal regular sequence in A such that A/(x1 , . . . , xn ) = k and g · xi = λi xi for all
i = 1, . . . , n. By [19, Lemma 1.7],

ord(G)

A reflection of a quantum polynomial ring A is a graded automorphism ρ such that
TrA (ρ, t) = (1 − t)−n (1 − ξt)−1 .
such that ξ 6= 1. If A is a quantum polynomial ring, then AG has finite global dimension if and only if G is
generated by reflections [18, Theorem 1.1]. The following is a sort of Shephard-Todd-Chevalley Theorem for
generalized Taft actions on kµ [u, v].
Theorem 5.3. Let T = Tn (λ, m, 0) act on A = kµ [u, v], ord(µ) = k, according to Proposition 3.1 (a). Then
AT is commutative. Moreover, gldim AT < ∞ if and only if µm = 1.
Proof. As is our convention, we assume g = diag(µ, λ−1 µ), x · u = 0, and x · v = ηu. By Proposition 3.1,
k | n, and by Lemma 5.1, Ahxi = kµm [u, v m ]. For any monomial in Ahxi we have
(5.4)

g · (ui v mj ) = µi (λ−1 µ)mj ui v mj = µi+mj ui v mj .

Hence, uα v β ∈ AT if and only if m | β and k | α + β, and all such monomials form a basis for AT . To see
that AT is always commutative, note that uα v β ua v b = µαb−βa ua v b uα v β . Thus, if uα v β , ua v b ∈ AT , then
since k | α + β and k | a + b, we have k | b(α + β) − β(a + b).
By [18, Theorem 1.1], if AT = (Ahxi )hgi has finite global dimension, then hgi must be a reflection. Note
that g · u = µu and g · v m = (λ−1 µ)m v m = µm v m . Hence, by [19, Lemma 1.7],
TrAhxi (g, t) = (1 − µt)−1 (1 − µm t)−1 .
Since µ 6= 1, then g is a reflection if and only if µm = 1.

Corollary 5.5. Suppose B(G, g, χ) has rank θ and that B acts linearly and inner faithfully on A =
kp [u1 , . . . , ut ]. Assume t, mi for all i, and ord(pij ) for all i 6= j are at least 3. Suppose, for each i, Bi
acts as a trivial extension of an action on A1i . Then u1 belongs to the center of AB .
Proof. Using the argument in Theorem 5.3, u1 and ui commute in ABi . Since AB = ∩i ABi then the result
follows.

Next we determine explicitly the presentation of the fixed ring AT in certain cases. Recall that for a
graded ring R, the m-Veronese subring is defined as
R(m) = R0 ⊕ Rm ⊕ R2m ⊕ · · · .
Proposition 5.6. Let T = Tn (λ, m, 0) act on A = kµ [u, v], ord(µ) = k, according to Proposition 3.1 (a).
(1) If k | m, then AT = k[uk , v m ].
(2) If m | k, then AT = k[uk , uk−m v m , uk−2m v 2m , . . . , v k ] ∼
= k[a, b]( k )
m

k
km
(3) If k > m and k − m | k, then AT = k[uk , uk−m v m , v k−m ] ∼
= k[a, b, c]/(ab − c k−m )

Proof. By (5.4), we have that AT has basis {uα v β | m | β, k | α + β}.
(1) Suppose k | m. Then, assuming m | β, we have k | α + β if and only if k | α. Thus, AT = k[uk , v m ].
This recovers [14, Lemma 2.1] in the case that m = n (when T is a Taft algebra).
(2) Since m | k, we have that m | α for any basis element as well. Thus, in this case, k | α + β if and only
if k/m | α/m + β/m. The basis elements commute, and the isomorphism is given by um 7→ a and v m 7→ b.
km
(3) We first show that AT is generated by uk , uk−m v m , v k−m . Let uα v β ∈ AT . Without loss of generality,
km
0 ≤ α < k and 0 ≤ β < k−m
. Since m | β, let ℓ = β/m. Since k|α + β, we have that α is the unique integer
with 0 ≤ α < k satisfying α ≡ −ℓm mod k. However, (k−m)ℓ is a solution, and 0 ≤ (k−m)ℓ = (k−m)β
< k.

Thus, α = (k − m)ℓ, so u v = u

. Therefore, the generators are as claimed. Now, by mapping

a 7→ uk , b 7→ v k−m , and c 7→ uk−m v m , we get a surjective homomorphism k[a, b, c]/(ab − c k−m ) −→ AT .

We show that this is an isomorphism by considering the Hilbert series. Note that k−m − 1 = k−m

5.2. Quantum exteriorV algebras. The Koszul dual of the quantum affine space kp [u1 , . . . , ut ] is the
quantum exterior algebra, p (u∗1 , . . . , u∗t ), generated by u∗1 , . . . , u∗t subject to the relations u∗i u∗j + pji u∗j u∗i = 0
V
and (u∗i )2 = 0. In the case t = 2, we represent this algebra simply as µ (u∗ , v ∗ ) where µ = p12 .
Suppose T =
V Tn (λ, m, 0) acts linearly and inner faithfully on A = kµ [u, v] according to Proposition 3.1
(a). Let A! = µ (u∗ , v ∗ ) be the Koszul dual of A. Let S = Tn (λ−1 , m, 0) and set the canonical generators
to be h and y. There is an action of S on A! given by
h · u∗ = µu∗ ,

h · v ∗ = λ−1 µv ∗ ,

y · u∗ = ηv ∗ ,

y · v ∗ = 0.

It is clear that h is an automorphism of B. We verify below that y acts on A! ,
y · (u∗ )2 = (h · u∗ )(y · u∗ ) + (y · u∗ )u∗ = (µu∗ )(ηv ∗ ) + (ηv ∗ )u∗ = 0,
y · (v ∗ )2 = (h · v ∗ )(y · v ∗ ) + (y · v ∗ )v ∗ = 0,
y · (u∗ v ∗ + µ−1 v ∗ u∗ ) = [(h · u∗ )(y · v ∗ ) + (y · u∗ )v ∗ ] + µ−1 [(h · v ∗ )(y · u∗ ) + (y · v ∗ )u∗ ]
= (ηv ∗ )v ∗ + µ−1 (λ−1 µv ∗ )(ηv ∗ ) = 0
Lemma 5.7. Suppose T = Tn (λ, m, 0) acts linearly and inner faithfully on A = kp [u1 , . . . , ut ]. Then there
is an action of S = Tn (λ−1 , m, 0) on A! = Λp (u∗1 , . . . , u∗t ) where, as matrices, h = g and y = xT .
Proof. Assume that T acts on A as a trivial extension of an action on A12 . The proof for arbitrary Aij is
similar. First note that
0 = (gx − λxg)T = xT g T − λg T xT = yh − λhy.
It remains to show that A! is an S-module algebra. By the above argument, S acts on (A! )12 . Suppose
j, k > 2. Then clearly y · (u∗k )2 = 0, y · (u∗2 u∗k + pk2 u∗k u∗2 ) = 0, and y · (u∗j u∗k + pkj u∗k u∗j ) = 0. It remains to
check that y · (u∗1 u∗k + pk1 u∗k u∗1 ) = 0. Note that
0 = x · (u2 uk − p2k uk u2 ) = u1 uk − p2k αk uk u1 = (p1k − p2k αk )uk u1 .
Hence, αk = p1k pk2 . Now
y · (u∗1 u∗k + pk1 u∗k u∗1 ) = (y · u∗1 )u∗k + pk1 (h · u∗k )(y · u∗1 )
= (η12 u∗2 )(u∗k ) + pk1 (αk u∗k )(η12 u∗2 )
= η12 (−pk2 + pk1 αk ) u∗k u∗2 = 0.
It follows that A! is an S-module algebra.



The above proposition extends in a natural way to higher rank actions. Given some g = {g1 , . . . , gθ } ⊂ G,
set gT = {g1T , . . . , gθT } and similarly for χ.
23

Proposition 5.8. Suppose B(G, g, χ) has rank θ, and that B acts linearly and inner faithfully on A =
kp [u1 , . . . , ut ]. Assume t, mi for all i, and ord(pij ) for all i 6= j are at least 3. Then there is an action of
B ′ (G, g T , χT ) on A! = Λp (u∗1 , . . . , u∗t ).
Proof. Lemma 5.7 implies that each Bi acts on A! as a trivial extension of some (A! )ij or (A! )ijk . That B
acts on A implies that B ′ satisfies the necessary compatibility conditions to define an action on A! .

5.3. Quantized Weyl algebras. Let p be a multiplicatively antisymmetric (t×t)-matrix and γ = (γ1 , . . . , γt ) ∈
(k× )t . Then Ap,γ
t (k) is the algebra with basis {ui , vi }, 1 ≤ i ≤ t, subject to the relations
vi vj = pij vj vi
ui uj = γi pij uj ui
uj vj = 1 + γj vj uj +

(all j).

ℓ<j

The (multiparameter) quantized Weyl algebra may be regarded as γ-difference operators on kp [u1 , . . . , ut ].
We study generalized Taft actions on multiparameter quantum Weyl algebras that are related to the
actions for quantum affines spaces studied previously. Recall that from Proposition 3.1 we understand rank
one actions on the first quantum Weyl algebra.
Suppose either the center of Ap,γ
t (k) is trivial or is a polynomial ring. By [2, Proposition 1.5] (t = 1), [25,
Theorem 4.2.5] (trivial center), and [22, Corollary 6.5] (polynomial ring center), φ ∈ Aut(Ap,γ
t (k)) has one
of two forms
(1) For all j ∈ 1, . . . , t, φ(uj ) = αj uj and φ(vj ) = αj−1 vj for some scalars αj ∈ k× .
(2) Fix k ∈ 1, . . . , t, then
• φ(uk ) = αk vk and φ(vk ) = −αk−1 uk for some scalar αk ∈ k× ;
×
• for j 6= k, φ(uj ) = αj uj and φ(vj ) = α−1
j vj for some scalars αj ∈ k ;
The second type only occurs under specific conditions on the parameters in the nontrivial center case that we
may safely ignore by our hypotheses. The automorphism group in cases not considered above is unknown.
There is a filtration F on Ap,γ
t (k) defined by setting deg(u
S i ) = deg(vi ) = i. That is, F = {Fi } where
p,γ
F and Fi Fj ⊂ Fi+j . The associated graded
Fk = Spank {a ∈ Ap,γ

deg(a)

so
that
A
(k)
=

t
i≥0
L i
p,γ
graded ring with respect to this filtration, grF (At (k)) =
i≥0 Fi /Fi−1 , is a quantum affine space. An
action of a Hopf algebra H respects the filtration F if h · Fk ⊂ Fk for all k and all h ∈ H.
Proposition 5.9. Suppose B(G, g, χ) has rank θ, and that B acts inner faithfully on A = Ap,γ
t (k) respecting
the filtration F . Assume the parameters for B and grF A are all roots of unity of order at least 3. Then
rank B ≤ 2(2t − 1).
Proof. Because B respects the filtration on A, then the action of B descends to an inner faithful, linear
action on grF A [8, Lemma 3.1]. The result now follows from Theorem 3.13.

It is not true that every action preserves F , as illustrated by the next example.
Example 5.10. Consider A = Ap,γ
and let T = Tn (λ, m, 0). Set γ1 = γ2 = λ, α1 = λα2 , and α2 = p12 .
2
−1
We define a diagonal action of g on A as above by setting g = diag(α1 , α−1
1 , α2 , α2 ). Suppose x · u2 = u1
−1
and x · v1 = −α2 v2 , and that x acts as zero on all other generators. It is left to check that x · r = 0 for all
relations r. We do the one check below and leave the rest to the reader.
−1
x · (u2 v1 − γ1 p12 v1 u2 ) = (u1 v1 − γ1 p12 α−1
1 v1 u1 ) − α2 (α2 u2 v2 − γ1 p12 v2 u2 )

= (1 + γ1 v1 u1 − v1 u1 ) − (1 + γ2 v2 u2 + (γ1 − 1)v1 u1 ) + α−1
2 γ1 p12 v2 u2
= (1 + (γ1 − 1)v1 u1 ) − (1 + (γ1 − 1)v1 u1 ) + (−γ2 + γ1 )v2 u2 = 0.
5.4. Quantum general and special linear groups. The quantum determinant of Oq (MN (k)) is the central
element
X
detq =
(−q)ℓ(π) Y1,π(1) Y2,π(2) · · · Yn,π(n) ,
π∈SN

24

where ℓ(π) denotes the length of the permutation π. In the case n = 2, this is the element AD − qBC.
The quantum determinant can then be used to define the corresponding quantum general linear group
Oq (GLN (k)) = Oq (MN (k))[detq−1 ] and quantum special linear group Oq (SLN (k)) = Oq (MN (k))/(detq −1).
Proposition 5.11. Suppose Tn (λ, m, 0) acts on Oq (MN (k)) according to
• rows 1,2,4, or 5 of Table 4.1 in the case N = 2, or
• rows 1,2,5, or 6 of Table 4.3 in the case N > 2.
Then the action descends to an action on Oq (SLN (k)) and lifts to an action on Oq (GLN (k)).
Proof. We claim in the cases listed above that both (detq −1) and (detq ) are T -stable ideals. Hence, the
action descends to an action on Oq (MN (k))/(detq −1) and lifts to an action on Oq (MN (k))[det−1
q ] [23,
Corollary 3.14]. Since detq is central, it suffices to prove for both cases that g · detq = detq and x · detq = 0.
Fix b > 1 and suppose δ 6= 0. We prove this for the case that g · Ya,b = q −1 Ya,b , g · Ya,b−1 = qYa,b−1 ,
x · Ya,b = δYa,b−1 and x · Yr,s = 0 for all a and for all r, s with s 6= b, b − 1. This corresponds to row 1 in
either Table 4.1 or 4.3. A similar argument applies to the other cases.
It is clear that g · detq = detq . We will prove the result for x using induction and the quantum Laplace
expansion [24, Corollary 4.4.4]. First suppose that N = 2 and consider the action defined in the first row
of Table 4.1, which corresponds to the action above. Recall that the quantum determinant in the case of
Oq (M2 (k)) is detq = AD − qBC. Hence,
x · detq = [(qA)(δC) + 0] − q [0 + (δA)C] = 0.
Now suppose N ≥ 3 and fix i 6= b, b − 1. Expanding along the ith column, we have
detq =

N
X

(−q)i−k Aki Yki ,

k=1

where Aki is the (k, i)-quantum minor of Oq (MN (k)). By induction, x · Aki = 0, and since x · Yki = 0, then
it follows that x · detq = 0.

6. Questions and remarks
Bosonizations of quantum linear spaces are important examples of finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras, however the full classification is much more robust [4]. Moreover, we placed restrictions on our
parameters that may ultimately be artificial. (See Proposition 3.1.) It would be interesting to know how the
bounds presented in this paper fit into the story of more general actions.
Question 6.1. Let H be a finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebra acting linearly and inner faithfully on
a quantum affine space or quantum matrix algebra. Does rank(H) satisfy the same bounds as in Theorems
3.13, 4.8, or 4.18?
On the other side, there are many important families of quantum algebras for which we have not or have
only partially considered the problem of classifying actions. In Section 5, we classified induced actions on
certain families of algebras. This leads naturally to a question of whether a more full classification is possible.
Of these, actions on quantum exterior algebras and quantized Weyl algebras seem the most within reach.
Question 6.2. Do the bounds in Theorems 3.13, 4.8, or 4.18 apply also to the “related” algebras considered
in Section 5?
The quantum matrix algebras considered in this paper are the single-parameter versions of a larger class
of multiparameter quantized matrix algebras (see [5]). It was clear to us that the classification problem for
generalized Taft algebras in this case is substantially more difficult. Nevertheless, under suitable restrictions,
it seems reasonable that one could attack this problem with some level of success.
Question 6.3. Does the classification of generalized Taft algebra actions on multiparameter quantized
matrix algebras align with the single-parameter versions given in Propositions 4.4 and 4.11? Do the bounds
given in Theorems 4.8 and 4.18 still apply?
More generally, we wonder whether there are methods that can simplify or consolidate some of the
computations above.
25

Question 6.4. Are there algebra invariants that control actions of pointed Hopf algebras? Locally nilpotent
derivations are controlled by the (noncommutative) discriminant [6]. Is there an analogue for skew derivations
associated to generalized Taft algebras?
In Section 5 we studied invariants of actions under generalized Taft actions. However, we were only able
to determine properties and the form of the fixed ring in certain cases.
Question 6.5. In general, is there is a nice presentation of the fixed ring kµ [u, v] under a generalized
Taft action? When does the fixed ring of kp [u1 , . . . , ut ] under a generalized Taft action have finite global
dimension?
