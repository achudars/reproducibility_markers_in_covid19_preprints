REGULAR BERNSTEIN BLOCKS
JEFFREY D. ADLER AND MANISH MISHRA
Abstract. For a connected reductive group G defined over a non-archimedean
local field F , we consider the Bernstein blocks in the category of smooth representations of G(F ). Bernstein blocks whose cuspidal support involves a regular
supercuspidal representation are called regular Bernstein blocks. Most Bernstein blocks are regular when the residual characteristic of F is not too small.
Under mild hypotheses on the residual characteristic, we show that the Bernstein center of a regular Bernstein block of G(F ) is isomorphic to the Bernstein
center of a regular depth-zero Bernstein block of G0 (F ), where G0 is a certain
twisted Levi subgroup of G. In some cases, we show that the blocks themselves
are equivalent, and as a consequence we prove the ABPS Conjecture in some
new cases.

1. Introduction
1.1. The problem. Let F be a nonarchimedean local field of residual characteristic p, and G a connected reductive F -group. One wants to understand the category
R(G(F )) of smooth, complex representations of G(F ). The
Q Bernstein decomposition [5] allows us to decompose this category into a product {[M,σ]G } R[M,σ]G (G(F ))
of full subcategories R[M,σ]G (G(F )), called Bernstein blocks, so it is in some sense
enough to understand each block. (Here, [M, σ]G ranges over the set of inertial
classes of G(F ). Such a class is represented by an F -Levi subgroup M of G and
an irreducible, supercuspidal representation σ of M (F ), and consists of the set
of all pairs (M ′ (F ), σ ′ ) that are equivalent to (M (F ), σ) under twisting by unramified characters of M (F ) and conjugation by elements of G(F ).) Each block
R[M,σ]G (G(F )) is a module category over an algebra, and one can construct an appropriate Hecke algebra in a more-or-less explicit way if [M, σ]G has an associated
Bushnell-Kutzko type [7]. In particular, if σ has depth zero, then the structure of
the Hecke algebra is given by Morris [19]. Thus, in principle, one way to understand
the category R(G(F )) would be to show that for each block R[M,σ]G (G(F )), there
is another connected reductive F -group G0 and a depth-zero block [M 0 , σ 0 ]G0 for
G0 (F ) such that the blocks are equivalent as categories.
Our aim in this paper is to study the structure of Bernstein blocks using the
above approach in many cases.
Let us remark that Kim and Yu [17] give a construction of types (see [17, §7.4]
for more details), and Fintzen [9] has recently shown that if G splits over a tame
extension of F and p does not divide the order of the Weyl group of G, then
every Bernstein block for G(F ) admits a type arising from this construction. The
Kim-Yu construction starts with a certain datum Σ, out of which it produces a

~ = (G0 ( . . . (
sequence of types (K i , ρi ) for groups Gi (F ), 0 ≤ i ≤ d, where G
d
G = G) is a tower of twisted Levi subgroups of G and which is part of the datum
Σ. Write (K, ρ) for (K d , ρd ) and write H(G, ρ∨ ) (resp. H(G0 , ρ∨
0 )) for the Hecke
algebra associated to the type (K, ρ) (resp. (K 0 , ρ0 )). Denote by Rf (G, ρ) (resp.
Rf (G0 , ρ0 )), the category of finite-length modules over H(G, ρ∨ ) (resp. H(G0 , ρ∨
0 )).
Existing results [12, 14, 16, 20, 21], together with a conjecture of Yu [26, Conjecture
0.2]) on supercuspidal blocks, suggest a more general conjecture:
Conjecture 1.1. There exists a bijection, determined by the choice of Σ, between
the simple modules of H(G, ρ∨ ) and those of H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ).
While the Hecke algebra H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ) is determined up to isomorphism, it (and thus
the bijection of the Conjecture) depends on Σ, which is not uniquely determined.
Remark 1.2. In many cases, something stronger than Conjecture 1.1 holds. Namely,
the datum Σ determines an isomorphism of Hecke algebras
(1.3)

∼

H(G, ρ∨ ) −→ H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ).

This is however not true in general. In many cases where the isomorphism of Hecke
algebras fails, it may still be true that there exists an equivalence of categories
(1.4)
Rf (G, ρ) ∼
= Rf (G0 , ρ0 ),
determined by the choice of Σ.
1.2. Bernstein center. In [15], Kaletha studies a large class of superpercuspidal
representations which he calls regular. Most supercuspidal representations are of
this kind when p is not too small (see the paragraph following [15, Definition 3.7.3]
to understand what is meant by “most”). We call a Bernstein block R[M,σ]G (G(F ))
regular if σ is a regular supercuspidal representation. Under certain restrictions on
p, we show in Theorem 7.4 that
Theorem 1.5. The Bernstein center of a regular Bernstein block R[M,σ]G (G(F ))
is isomorphic to the Bernstein center of a depth-zero regular Bernstein block
0
R[M ,σ0 ]G0 (G0 (F )) of a twisted Levi subgroup G0 of G.
When M = G, this result is covered by [18, Theorem 6.1] which proves such an
isomorphism for tame supercuspidal blocks. Thus, Theorem 1.5 is a generalization
for regular Bernstein blocks of the main result of [18].
1.3. Hecke algebra isomorphism. Suppose M = G. Then Conjecture 1.1 would
follow from [26, Conjecture 0.2], which appears here as Conjecture 6.3. We show
(Corollary 6.4) that the conjecture is true if the F -split rank of the center of G
is at most 1; or if σ is generic; or if p satisfies some mild hypotheses, and the
restriction of σ to the derived group of G decomposes into regular supercuspidal
representations.
Now let us consider the case where M is not necessarily equal to G. Let (K, ρ)
be the [M, σ]G -type obtained out of the datum Σ by the Kim-Yu construction.
~ of twisted Levi subgroups contained in the datum Σ
Assume that the tower G
consists of F -Levi subgroups. Then we show (in Corollary 8.6) that Equation (1.3)
and consequently Conjecture 1.1 holds. This follows as an easy consequence of the
~ consists of F -Levi subgroups holds
results in [17]. The condition that the tower G

particular, it holds when G is split and M is a maximal split torus in G. Thus,
as a very special case, one obtains Equation (1.3) (and consequently Conjecture
1.1) for principal series blocks of split groups, recovering the result of Roche [22].
We also prove Equation (1.3) for certain principal series blocks of non-split groups
(Proposition 8.4) for suitably large p.
We prove weaker versions of Equation (1.3) for more general situations in §10.
1.4. Consequences for the ABPS Conjecture. Aubert, Baum, Plymen, and
Solleveld [3] conjecture that the set of irreducible objects in a Bernstein block has
the structure of a particular twisted extended quotient. This “ABPS Conjecture”
holds for depth-zero Bernstein blocks due to the work of Solleveld [25]. We show,
using this result of Solleveld, that under certain restrictions on p, Conjecture 1.1 for
a regular Bernstein block implies ABPS Conjecture for that block. Consequently,
we obtain the ABPS Conjecture for many new cases (Theorem 9.5), namely those
mentioned in the previous section. In particular, as the simplest case, we obtain
ABPS Conjecture for principal series blocks of split groups. This reproves a part
of the main result in [4] in a much shorter way. However, unlike Theorem 9.5, the
proof in loc. cit. is independent of the main result of [25].
Solleveld has, in a recent preprint, given a complete proof of the ABPS Conjecture [24, Theorem D]. His proof bypasses the type-theoretic approach and builds
instead on the ideas of Bernstein [5] and Heiermann [13]. Moreover, under certain
technical hypotheses (the existence and compatibility of certain co-cycles), he also
shows [24, Theorem B] that the category Rf (G, ρ) is equivalent to the finite-length
module category of a twisted affine Hecke algebra. Under the same hypothesis
and some additional residue characteristic hypotheses (Hypothesis 5.1), his results
may be used to establish Equation (1.4) for regular Bernstein blocks provided one
shows that the isomorphisms of Theorems 7.1 and 7.3 respect a certain finer structure dictated by Harish-Chandra µ-function. We plan to pursue these matters in a
subsequent work.
1.5. Acknowledgments. It is a pleasure for the authors to thank the following.
Maarten Solleveld clarified for us the definition of the twisted extended quotient and
pointed out an error in a previous draft. Anne-Marie Aubert pointed out that the
isomorphism of Hecke algebras in Remark 1.2 is false in general for tame Bernstein
blocks. Adéle Bourgeois pointed out a typographical error in Definition 5.2. An
anonymous referee provided comments that helped us to improve the exposition of
this work.
2. Notation
Throughout this article, F denotes a non-archimedean local field of residue characteristic p. If G is a reductive F -group and K is a subgroup of G(F ), we will denote
gKg −1 by g K for g ∈ G(F ). If ρ is a representation of K, then g ρ will denote the
representation x 7→ ρ(g −1 xg) of g K. If H is a subgroup of a group G, then NG (H)
denotes the normalizer of H in G.
Write B(G, F ) for the Bruhat-Tits building of G(F ). For any point x ∈ B(G, F ),
we write G(F )x,0 for the parahoric subgroup of G(F ) associated to x, and we let
G(F )x:0:0+ denote the quotient of G(F )x,0 by its maximal pro-p subgroup. If G
is a torus, then we omit x from the notation and just write G(F )0 for the unique

4

JEFFREY D. ADLER AND MANISH MISHRA

parahoric subgroup of G(F ), and we also let G(F )b denote the unique maximal
bounded subgroup.
For an F -group A whose connected part is a torus, let As and Aan denote the
maximal F -split and F -anisotropic subtori in A, respectively.
3. Review of the Bernstein center
Throughout, G denotes a connected reductive F -group. We quickly review general theory and fix some notation.
3.1. Bernstein decomposition. Let ◦ G(F ) denote the subgroup
{g ∈ G(F ) : |ν(g)| = 1 for every character ν ∈ HomF (G, Gm )},
and let Xnr (G(F )) = Hom(G(F )/◦ G(F ), C× ). The group Xnr (G(F )) is called the
group of unramified characters of G(F ). Consider the pairs (L(F ), σ) where L is an
F -Levi subgroup of G and σ is an irreducible supercuspidal representation of L(F ).
Denote by [L, σ]G its inertial equivalence class: the set of pairs (L′ , σ ′ ), such that
L′ is an F -Levi subgroup of G, σ ′ is an irreducible, supercuspidal representation of
L(F ), and (L′ , σ ′ ) = (g L, g σ ⊗ ν) for some g ∈ G(F ) and ν ∈ Xnr (L(F )). The set
of inertial equivalence classes is called the Bernstein spectrum of G(F ), which we
denote by B(G, F ). Let R(G(F )) denote the category of smooth representations
of G(F ). We say that a smooth irreducible representation π has inertial support
s = [L, σ]G if π appears as a subquotient of a representation parabolically induced
from some element of the class s. Define a full subcategory Rs (G(F )) of R(G(F ))
as follows: π ∈ R(G(F )) belongs to Rs (G(F )) if each irreducible subquotient of π
has inertial support s. We will denote the class of irreducible objects in Rs (G(F ))
by Irrs (G(F )).
Theorem 3.1 (Bernstein). We have a decomposition
Y
Rs (G(F )).
R(G(F )) =
s∈B(G,F )

3.2. Hecke algebra. Let (τ, W ) be an irreducible representation of a compact
open subgroup J of G(F ). The Hecke algebra H(G, τ ) is the space of compactly
supported functions f : G(F ) −→ EndC (τ ) satisfying
f (j1 gj2 ) = τ (j1 )f (g)τ (j2 ).
The standard convolution algebra gives H(G, τ ) the structure of an associative
C-algebra with identity.
We say that (J, τ ) is an s-type if Rs (G(F )) is precisely the subcategory of
R(G(F )) consisting of smooth representations which are generated by their τ isotypic component. In that case, Rs (G(F )) is equivalent to the category of nondegenerate modules of H(G, τ ∨ ), where τ ∨ is the dual of τ ([7]).
3.3. Bernstein center. Let s = [L, σ]G ∈ B(G, F ) and set t = [L, σ]L ∈ B(L, F ).
The center Z(G(F )) (resp. Zs (G(F )), resp. Zt (L(F ))) of the category R(G(F ))
(resp. Rs (G(F )), resp. Rt (L(F ))) is called its Bernstein center. Recall here that
the center of an abelian category is the endomorphism ring of the identity functor.
Let
N s = {n ∈ NG (L)(F ) | n σ ∼
= σν for some ν ∈ Xnr (L(F ))},

and write W s = N s /L(F ). The set Irrt (L(F )) of irreducible objects of Rt (L(F ))
has the structure of a complex affine variety, on which the group W s acts algebraically. (The variety Irrt (L(F )) is (non-canonically) isomorphic to the quotient
Xnr (L(F ))/{χ ∈ Xnr (L(F )) | σχ = σ}.)
Theorem 3.2 (Bernstein). [5] The Bernstein center of Rs (G(F )) can be viewed
as the ring of regular functions on the quotient variety Irrt (L(F ))/W s .

4. Review of tame and regular supercuspidal representations
4.1. Tame supercuspidal representations. Assume that G splits over the maximal tamely ramified extension F t of F . A tamely twisted Levi subgroup of G′ of
G is a reductive F -subgroup such that G′ ⊗ F t is an F t -Levi subgroup of G ⊗ F t .
~ where G
~ π0 , φ),
~ = (G0 , . . . , Gd ) is a tower of algebraic
Let Σ denote the datum (G,
subgroups of G,
G0 ( . . . ( Gd = G,
such that Z(G0 )/Z(G) is anisotropic and each Gi is a tamely twisted Levi subgroup
~ = (φ0 , . . . , φd )
of G, π0 is a depth-zero supercuspidal representation of G0 (F ) and φ
i
×
is such that φi : G (F ) −→ C is a smooth character of depth ri > 0. We require
the datum Σ to satisfy several technical conditions. (See [11, §3.1] for a precise
list. Note that this source and others, e.g., [15], use the notation π−1 for the
representation that we are calling π0 .)
Yu’s construction [26] produces a supercuspidal representation π out of the datum Σ. Recently, Fintzen [10] has shown that if the residue characteristic p does
not divide the order of the Weyl group, this construction yields all supercuspidal
representations of G(F ).
4.2. Regular supercuspidal representations. Let (S, θ) be a pair consisting of
tame maximal F -torus S in G and a character θ : S(F ) −→ C× . A Kaletha-Howe
~ where G
~ φ),
~ = (S = G−1 ⊂ G0 ( . . . ( Gd = G)

and some additional technical conditions (see [15, Definition 3.6.2]).
If the datum (S, θ) is a tame regular elliptic pair, i.e., it satisfies the conditions in
[15, Definition 3.7.5], then the pair (S, φ−1 ) determines a depth-zero supercuspidal
representation π0 of G0 (F ) and the datum

Σ = (G0 ( . . . ( Gd = G), π0 , (φ0 , . . . , φd )

is a Yu datum and therefore produces a supercuspidal representation π(S, θ) of
G(F ). These representations are called regular supercuspidal representations.
If (S, θ) and (S ′ , θ′ ) are tame regular elliptic pairs in G, then π(S, θ) and π(S ′ , θ′ )
are equivalent if and only if (S, θ) and (S ′ , θ′ ) are conjugate in G(F ).

5. A result on multiplicity one upon restriction
In this section, we will assume the following.
Hypothesis 5.1. The residue characteristic p of F is not a bad prime for G (see
[15, §2.1]) and does not divide the order of the fundamental group of the derived
group Gder of G.
Let (S, θ) be a tame regular elliptic pair in G and π(S, θ) the associated regular
supercuspidal representation. Let G′ be an F -subgroup of G such that Gder ⊂
G′ ⊂ G. Write S ′ = S ∩ G′ and θ′ = θ|S ′ (F ) . Let NG(F ) (S ′ , θ′ |S ′ (F )0 ) denote the
stabilizer of θ′ |S ′ (F )0 in NG (S ′ )(F ).
Definition 5.2. The pair (S, θ) is regular in G′ if NG(F ) (S ′ , θ′ |S ′ (F )0 ) = S(F ).
Theorem 5.3. If (S, θ) is a tame regular elliptic pair in G which is regular in G′ ,
then π(S, θ)|G′ (F ) is multiplicity free.
We observe that (S, θ) is regular in G′ if and only if the components of π|G′ (F )
are regular supercuspidals. If (S, θ) is not regular in G′ , then higher multiplicities
can occur, even though (S, θ) is regular in G. See [2, §7] for an example.
Looking at general irreducible representations of G(F ), there are many situations
where one can prove that the restriction to G′ (F ) is multiplicity free. See [8]
for a conjecture, together with a proof for tempered representation under some
assumptions about the local Langlands correspondence. See [2] for a conjecture,
reduction to the tempered case, examples, and an announcement of Theorem 5.3.
Proof of Theorem 5.3. Since (S, θ) is regular in G′ , it follows from [15, Definition
3.7.5 and Lemma 3.6.5] that (S ′ , θ′ ) is a tame regular elliptic pair in G′ . Let V ′
(resp. V ) be the space realizing the representation π(S ′ , θ′ ) (resp. π(S, θ)). One can
describe these spaces explicitly, since each regular supercuspidal representation is
induced from a representation of a compact open subgroup. We now describe an
embedding of V ′ in V .
From Yu’s construction [26], we see that
• π(S, θ) is induced from a smooth irreducible representation ρ of an open
subgroup K of G(F ) that is compact modulo the center of G(F );
• π(S ′ , θ′ ) is similarly induced from (K ′ , ρ′ ); and
• we can realize ρ′ as an irreducible subrepresentation of ρ|K ′ .
Let W and W ′ be the spaces realizing ρ and ρ′ . Thus, W ′ is a subspace of W . We
have
M
k
W ′.
W =
k∈K/ StabK (W ′ )

Pick coset representatives k1 , . . . , kn of K/ StabK W ′ . Let
ι : End(W ′ ) −→ End(W )
be given by
ι : λ′ 7→

Then for all k ′ ∈ K ′ , ι(ρ′ (k ′ )) = ρ(k ′ ). Define an embedding ι : V ′ −→ V by
setting, for f ′ ∈ V ′ , ι(f ′ ) to be the function f ∈ V given by
(

if g ∈
/ G′ (F )K,
f (g) =
.
′ ′
ι(f (g ))ρ(k) if f = g ′ k, where g ′ ∈ G′ (F ), k ∈ K
To see that the function f = ι(f ′ ) is well defined, let g1′ k1 = g2′ k2 , where g1′ , g2′ ∈
G′ (F ) and k1 , k2 ∈ K. Then g1′−1 g2′ = k1 k2−1 ∈ G′ (F ) ∩ K = K ′ . We have
ι(f ′ (g2′ )ρ(k2 ) = ι(f ′ (g1′ g1′−1 g2′ )ρ(k2 )
= ι(f ′ (g1′ ))ρ(k1 k2−1 )ρ(k2 )
= ι(f ′ (g1′ ))ρ(k1 ).
This proves that f is well defined. Now since S(F ) ⊂ K, it follows that S(F )
preserves ι(V ′ ). Thus
StabG(F ) ι(V ′ ) ⊇ S(F )G′ (F ).
By Clifford theory
M
g
π(S ′ , θ′ ).
π(S, θ) =
g∈G(F )/StabG(F ) ι(V ′ )

We claim that for g ∈
/ StabG(F ) ι(V ′ ), g π(S ′ , θ′ ) ≇ π(S ′ , θ′ ). For suppose that
g
′ ′ ∼
′ ′
π(S , θ ) = π(S , θ ) for some g ∈ G(F ). Equivalently, (g S ′ , g θ′ ) is G′ (F )-conjugate
to (S ′ , θ′ ). So there exists a g ′ ∈ G′ (F ) such that g ′ g stabilizes (S ′ , θ′ ). So g ∈
G′ (F )NG(F ) (S ′ , θ′ ). But by hypothesis, NG(F ) (S ′ , θ′ |S ′ (F )0 ) ⊂ S(F ). It follows
that g ∈ StabG(F ) ι(V ′ ). This proves the claim.
Thus the summands g π(S ′ , θ′ ) for g ∈ G(F )/ StabG(F ) ι(V ′ ) are non-isomorphic
and consequently, π(S, θ)|G′ (F ) is multiplicity free.

6. Hecke algebra for supercuspidal blocks
Let (π, V ) denote a supercuspidal representation of G(F ). Then π|◦ G(F ) is a
finite direct sum of finite representations of ◦ G(F ), all of which are G(F )-conjugate
up to isomorphism. Fix an irreducible component (◦ π, ◦ V ) of π|◦ G(F ) . Then
G(F )

EndG(F ) (ind◦ G(F ) ◦ π) is canonically isomorphic to the convolution algebra H(G, ◦ π)
of ◦ π-spherical functions ([23, §1.1.2]) and the Bernstein component Rs (G(F )) is
canonically equivalent to the module category of H(G, ◦ π ∨ ), where s = [G, π]G .
Theorem 6.1. [23, Prop. 1.6.1.2] The Hecke algebra H(G, ◦ π) is commutative if
and only if π|◦ G(F ) is multiplicity free.
Proposition 6.2. The restriction π|◦ G(F ) is multiplicity free if the split rank of
the identity component of the center of G is 0 or 1.
Proof. Let Z denote the center of G. Then in this situation, G(F )/(Z(F ) · ◦ G(F ))
is cyclic. The result then follows from [23, Remark 1.6.1.3].

Now let π be a tame supercuspidal representation of G(F ). Then by Yu’s construction, π is compactly induced from a representation ρ of an open, compact
mod center subgroup K of G(F ). Let ◦ K denote the maximal compact subgroup
K ∩ ◦ G(F ) of K, and let ◦ ρ be any irreducible component of ρ|◦ K . Then (◦ K, ◦ ρ)
is an s-type where s = [G, π]G ([7, Prop. 5.4]). The representation π is constructed
out of a depth-zero representation π0 of a twisted Levi subgroup G0 of G together

8

with additional data. The representation π0 is compactly induced from a representation ρ0 of a compact mod center subgroup K 0 of G0 (F ). Define an s0 -type
(◦ K 0 , ◦ ρ0 ) analogously, where s0 = [G0 (F ), π0 ]G0 (F ) .
Jiu-Kang Yu makes the following conjecture [26, Conjecture 0.2].
Conjecture 6.3 (Yu’s conjecture). There is an algebra isomorphism
H(G,◦ ρ) ∼
= H(G0 , ◦ ρ0 ).
Corollary 6.4. Yu’s conjecture holds if any of the following conditions hold:
(a) The split rank of the identity component of the center of G is 0 or 1.
(b) Hypothesis 5.1 holds, and the irreducible components of π|Gder (F ) are regular.
(c) π is generic.
Proof. By [18, Cor. 6.3], the centers of H(G,◦ ρ) and H(G0 , ◦ ρ0 ) are isomorphic.
Thus, the conjecture is true if both of these Hecke algebras are commutative. From
Theorem 6.1 it will be enough to show that π and π0 restrict without multiplicity to
◦
G(F ) and ◦ G0 (F ), respectively. Suppose condition (a) holds. Then our restrictions
are multiplicity free from Proposition 6.2, together with the fact that the centers of
G and G0 have the same split rank. Suppose condition (b) holds. By [15, Lemma
3.6.5], the components of π0 |(G0 ∩Gder )(F ) are regular. Thus our restrictions are
multiplicity free from Theorem 5.3. Suppose condition (c) holds. From a result of
Stephen DeBacker and Cheng-Chiang Tsai, π0 is also generic, and so our restrictions
are multiplicity free from [23, Remark 1.6.1.3].

Note that in proving that Yu’s conjecture holds under condition (c), we have
used a result that is not yet in the literature. Readers who are unhappy about this
can strengthen condition (c) to assert that both π and π0 are generic.
7. Bernstein center of regular blocks
Assume Hypothesis 5.1.
Let L be an F -Levi subgroup of G and let (S, θ) be a tame regular elliptic pair
in L. Write π = π(S, θ) for the associated regular supercuspidal representation of
L(F ). The pair (S, θ) produces a chain (S = G−1 ⊆ G0 . . . Gd = G) of twisted
Levi subgroups of G. Write L0 = L ∩ G0 . Let φi : Gi (F ) −→ C× , −1 ≤ i ≤ d,
be the sequence of characters obtained from a Howe factorization of (S, θ). Then
Qd
θ = θ− θ+ , where θ− = φ−1 |S(F ) and θ+ = i=0 φi |S(F ) . It follows from [15, Lemma
3.6.5] that (S, θ− ) is a depth-zero tame regular elliptic pair for L0 . Let π0 (S, θ− )
denote the associated depth-zero regular supercuspidal representation of L0 (F ).
Write t = [L, π]L and t0 = [L0 , π0 ]L0 .
Theorem 7.1. [18, Theorem 6.1]The map
f : π ⊗ ν ∈ Irrt (L(F )) 7→ π0 ⊗ (ν|L0 (F ) ) ∈ Irrt0 (L0 (F )),

ν ∈ Xnr (L(F )),

is an isomorphism of varieties.
For s = [L, π]G , recall that we denote by W s the stabilizer of s in (NG L)(F )/L(F ),
i.e., W s = N s /L(F ), where
N s = {n ∈ NG (L)(F ) | n π ∼
= πν, for some ν ∈ Xnr (L(F ))}.
Similarly define s0 , N s0 and W s0 by replacing L, π and G in the above definition
by L0 , π0 and G0 .

Lemma 7.2. The stabilizer of θ|S(F )b in NG (S)(F ) lies in NG0 (S)(F ) and equals
the stabilizer of θ− |S(F )b there.
Proof. The proof is identical to the proof of [15, Lemma 3.6.5] when we replace
S(F )r there with S(F )b .

We observe here that θ+ is invariant under NG (S)(F ). This follows from the
observation in the first paragraph of the proof of [15, Lemma 3.6.5] that for 0 ≤
i ≤ d, φi |S(F ) is invariant under NG (S)(F ).
Theorem 7.3. There is a group isomorphism
ιπ : W s ∼
= W s0 .
Moreover, the isomorphism f is equivariant with respect to the isomorphism ιπ .
We remark here that since G0 depends on the choice of (S, θ), so does the isomorphism ιπ .
Proof. Take n ∈ N s . So n ∈ NG (L)(F ) and n (S, θ) is L(F )-conjugate to (S, θλ)
for some λ ∈ Xnr (S). This implies that there exists an l ∈ L(F ) such that l−1 n ∈
StabNG (L)(F ) (θ|S(F )b ). By Lemma 7.2, l−1 n ∈ StabNG0 (L0 )(F ) (θ− |S(F )b ). Thus
l−1 n

(S, θ− ) = (S, θ− λ) and hence get a map W s −→ W s0 induced by the map
n ∈ N s −→ l−1 n ∈ N s0 . We claim that this map is an isomorphism. Suppose
−1
n0 ∈ N s0 . Then n0 ∈ NG0 (L0 )(F ) such that l0 n0 (S, θ− ) = (S, θ− λ− ) for some
−1
0
l0 ∈ L (F ) and some λ− ∈ Xnr (S). Thus l0 n0 ∈ StabNG0 (S)(F ) (θ− |S(F )b ). By
Lemma 7.2, l0−1 n0 ∈ StabNG (S)(F ) (θ|S(F )b ). We now show that l0−1 n0 ∈ NG (L)(F ).
Recall that Z(L0 )/Z(L) is F -anisotropic. That is,
Z(L)◦s = Z(L0 )◦s .
Let n = l0−1 n0 . Since n ∈ NG0 (L0 )(F ), n preserves Z(L0 ) and since n is rational, n preserves Z(L0 )◦s . Thus n preserves Z(L)◦s and therefore also preserves
ZG (Z(L)◦s ) = L.
−1
Finally since θ+ is invariant under l0−1 n0 , l0 n0 (S, θ) = (S, θλ− ). This completes
the proof.

Theorem 7.4. There is an algebra isomorphism
Zs (G(F )) ∼
= Zs0 (G0 (F )).
Proof. By Theorem 7.1, the map
f : π ⊗ ν ∈ Irrt (L(F )) 7→ π0 ⊗ (ν|L0 (F ) ) ∈ Irrt0 (L0 (F )), ν ∈ Xnr (L(F ))
is an isomorphism of varieties and by Theorem 7.3, it is equivariant with respect to
the isomorphism ιπ . Consequently, there is an isomorphism of quotient varieties,
Irrt (L(F ))/W s ∼
= Irrt0 (L(F ))/W s0 .
Since Zs (G(F )) (resp. Zs0 (G0 (F ))) is the ring of regular functions on the Bernstein
variety Irrt (L(F ))/W s (resp. Irrt0 (L(F ))/W s0 ), the result follows.

8. Hecke algebra of tame types

Σ = ((G,

as in [17, §7.2]. So G
0
G, M is a Levi subgroup of G0 , ~r = (r0 , . . . , rd ) is a sequence of real numbers, y
is a point in B(M 0 , F ), {ι} is a commutative diagram

where M i is the centralizer in Gi of Z(M 0 )s . The diagram {ι} is required to be
~s-generic relative to y (see [17, §3.5, Definition]), where ~s = (0, r0 /2, . . . , rd−1 /2).
The group KM 0 is a compact open subgroup of M 0 (F ) containing the parahoric
M 0 (F )y,0 as a normal subgroup, and ρM 0 is an irreducible smooth representation
of KM 0 such that ρM 0 |M 0 (F )y,0 contains a cuspidal representation of the finite
~ = (φ0 , . . . , φd ), where each φi is a character of
quotient M 0 (F )y,0:0+ . Finally, φ

G (F ). The datum Σ is constrained by several conditions (loc. cit.).
From the datum Σ, Kim and Yu’s construction produces a sequence of BushnellKutzko types (K i , ρi ) for Gi (F ). Write K = K d and ρ = ρd .
Theorem 8.2. Let Σ be the datum as above. Assume that for 0 ≤ i ≤ d, Gi is
the Levi factor of a rational parabolic subgroup of G. Moreover, in the commutative
diagram {ι}, choose B(Gi , F ) ֒→ B(Gi+1 , F ) to be ri /2-generic. Then Σ determines
an isomorphism
∼
H(G, ρ∨ ) −→ H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ).
Proof. Let P = Gd−1 U be a parabolic subgroup of G with Levi factor Gd−1 and
P̄ = Gd−1 Ū the opposite parabolic. Then by [17, Lemma 6.2(a)], K is decomposed
d
with respect to (U, Gd−1 , Ū ). Let K+ = K+
be as defined in [17, §7.4]. Then since
K ∩ U = K+ ∩ U and K ∩ Ū = K+ ∩ Ū by the genericity of {ι}, it follows that
K ∩ U , K ∩ Ū ⊂ ker(ρd ). By [17, Theorem 8.1], the support of the Hecke algebra
H(G, ρ∨ ) is contained in KGd−1 (F )K. Thus, by [7, Theorem 7.2(ii)],
∼

H(G, ρ∨ ) −→ H(Gd−1 , ρ∨
d−1 ).
The result follows by induction.



Corollary 8.3. Let Σ be as in equation (8.1). In the commutative diagram {ι},
choose B(Gi , F ) ֒→ B(Gi+1 , F ) to be ri /2-generic. Assume moreover that the connected center of G0 is split modulo the center of G. Then Σ determines an isomorphism
∼
H(G, ρ∨ ) −→ H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ).
Proof. Let Z i denote the connected center of Gi , 0 ≤ i ≤ d. Then Gi is the
i

centralizer of Z i in G. Since by assumption, Zan
i
i
it follows that G is the centralizer of Zs in G. Therefore all Gi are in fact F -Levi
subgroups. The result then follows from Theorem 8.2.

Assume G is quasi-split and let T be a maximal torus contained in an F -Borel
subgroup. Write T der for the preimage of T in Gder . Assume Hypothesis 5.1. Let θ
~ denote the Kaletha-Howe factorization of (T, θ)
~ φ)
be a character of T (F ). Let (G,
and let ri denote the depth of φi . Put M 0 = T , KM 0 = T (F )0 and ρM 0 = θ|T (F )0 .
Since T is contained in a Borel subgroup, M i = T for 0 ≤ i ≤ d. Choose any point
y ∈ B(M 0 , F ) and choose {ι} such that B(Gi , F ) ֒→ B(Gi+1 , F ) is ri /2-generic. Let
Σ be the datum consisting of these choices and let (K i , ρi ) be the Bushnell-Kutzko
types for Gi constructed out of Σ by Kim and Yu’s construction. Then (K, ρ) is a
[T, θ]G -type and (K 0 , ρ0 ) is a [T, θ0 ]G0 -type for a depth-zero character θ0 of T (F ).
Proposition 8.4. Assume that p is co-prime to the order of Tan ∩ Ts and to the
order of the component group π0 (Tan ∩ T der). Suppose θ is a character of T (F ) that
is trivial on Tan (F )0+ . Let Σ be a datum as in the previous paragraph. Then Σ can
be chosen suitably so that there is an isomorphism
∼

H(G, ρ∨ ) −→ H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ),
determined by this choice.
Proof. From Theorem 8.2, it will be enough to show that the groups Gi appearing
in the datum Σ are all Levi factors of parabolic F -subgroups of G. Equivalently,
each Gi is the centralizer in G of an F -split torus.
We will see from Lemma 8.5 that θ has a Howe factorization (φ−1 , φ0 , . . . , φd )
where each character φi , i ≥ 0, is trivial on Tan (F ).
Choose an additive character Λ of F that is nontrivial on the ring of integers in
F , but trivial on the prime ideal.
For 0 ≤ i < d, let ri denote the depth of φi . Composing each φi |T (F )ri with
the isomorphism ei : Lie(T )(F )ri / Lie(T )(F )ri + −→ T (F )ri /T (F )ri + , we obtain
a character of Lie(T )(F )ri / Lie(T )(F )ri + . Such a character must have the form
X 7→ Λ(Y (X)), where Y ∈ Lie∗ (T )(F )−ri / Lie∗ (T )(F )−ri + . We can choose a good
coset representative ai in Y so that Gi is the centraliser CG (ai )(F ) of ai in G. By
our assumption on p, we can in fact choose ai to be in Lie(Ts )(F ). Then it follows
that Gi is in fact an F -Levi subgroup. Indeed, CG (ai )(F ) = CG (Tai )(F ), where
Tai is the F -split subtorus of T corresponding to the Galois fixed co-torsion-free
submodule Xai of the character lattice X of T , where Xai = {x ∈ X | (dx)(ai ) = 0}
where dx denotes the derivative of x.

We take care of some unfinished business from the previous proof. Let S ⊆ G be
a tame maximal F -torus, and S ′ ⊂ S an F -subtorus. Denote by S der the preimage
of S in Gder . Assume that p satisfies Hypothesis 5.1 and is co-prime to the order
of the component group π0 (S ′ ∩ S der ).
Lemma 8.5. Let θ : S(F ) −→ C× be a character of depth r > 0 that is trivial on
S ′ (F )0+ . Then the pair (S, θ) has a Howe factorization (φ−1 , φ0 , . . . , φd ), where
each character φi , i ≥ 0, is also trivial on S ′ (F ).
Proof. The existence of a Howe factorization is [15, Proposition 3.6.7]. For us, the
key step is Lemma 3.6.9 loc. cit., which shows that if θ is G-generic, then there is a
character φ of G(F ) such that φ and θ agree on S(F )r . It will be enough to show
that φ can be chosen to be trivial on S ′ (F ).
The first part of the proof of Lemma 3.6.9 loc. cit. shows that θ is trivial on
S der (F )r . Write D′ = G/S ′ Gder = S/S ′ S der . From Lemma 3.1.3 loc. cit., it

12

JEFFREY D. ADLER AND MANISH MISHRA

follows that D′ (F )r = S(F )r /(S ′ S der )(F )r . Now again by Lemma 3.1.3 loc. cit.,
(S ′ /(S ′ ∩ S der ))(F )r ∼
= (S ′ /(S ′ ∩ S der )◦ )(F )r = S ′ (F )r /(S ′ ∩ S der )◦ (F )r . Thus θ
′
is trivial on S (F )r and on (S ′ /(S ′ ∩ S der ))(F )r = (S ′ S der /S ′ )(F )r and therefore
on (S ′ S der )(F )r . Consequently, θ descends to a character of D′ (F )r . This character
can be extended to a character D′ (F ) → C× , trivial on D′ (F )r+ , which can then
be pulled back to give a character φ of G(F ) that is trivial on S ′ (F ), and whose
restriction to S(F )r is equal to that of θ.

Proposition 8.4 implies the following.
Corollary 8.6. Suppose the derived group Gder is F -split, and p satisfies Hypothesis 5.1. Then the Hecke algebra of every principal series block of G(F ) is isomorphic
to the Hecke algebra of a depth-zero principal series block of a Levi subgroup G0 (F )
of G(F ):
∼
H(G, ρ∨ ) −→ H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ).
Remark 8.7. The Hecke algebras of depth-zero Bernstein blocks are known due to
the work of Morris [19]. Therefore Corollary 8.6 can be used to produce generators
and relations for the Hecke algebras of principal series blocks of split groups. This
was worked out by Roche [22]. Note that Proposition 8.4 also applies to some
principal-series blocks of non-split groups.
9. Consequences for ABPS
9.1. Twisted extended quotient. We recall here the notion of twisted extended
quotients as given in [3, §2.1]. Let Γ be a group acting on a topological space X
and let Γx denote the stabilizer in Γ of x ∈ X. Let ♮ denote a family of 2-cocycles
♮x : Γx × Γx −→ C× .
Define
e♮ = {(x, ρ) | x ∈ X, ρ ∈ Irr C[Γx , ♮x ]},
X

e♮
where C[Γx , ♮x ] denotes the group algebra of Γx twisted by ♮x . Topologize X
e♮ is open if and only if its projection to the first
by requiring that a subset of X
coordinate is open in X. Let {φγ,x | (γ, x) ∈ Γ × X}, denote a family of algebra
isomorphisms
φγ,x : C[Γx , ♮x ] −→ C[Γγx , ♮γx ]
satisfying the conditions:
(a) if γx = x, then φγ,x is conjugation by an element of C[Γx , ♮x ]× .
(b) φγ ′ ,γx φγ,x = φγ ′ γ,x for all γ ′ , γ ∈ Γ and x ∈ X.
e♮ by
Define a Γ-action on X
γ · (x, ρ) = (γx, ρ ◦ φ−1
γ,x ).

Then the twisted extended quotient of X by Γ is defined to be:
e♮ //Γ.
(X//Γ)♮ := X

Remark 9.1. The twisted extended quotient depends on the choices of the algebra
isomorphisms φγ,x . If ♮x is trivial for all x ∈ X, then there is a canonical choice.
Namely, φγ,x is conjugation by γ (see [3, §2.1]).

9.2. ABPS Conjecture. Write s = [L, π]G , t = [L, π]L and let W s,t denote the
stabilizer in W s of a point t in Irrt (L(F )).
The ABPS conjecture [3, §2.3] asserts that there exists a family of 2-cocycles
♮t : W s,t × W s,t −→ C× , t ∈ Irrt (L(F ))
such that there is a natural bijection
Irrs (G(F )) ←→ (Irrt (L(F ))//W s )♮ .

(9.2)

This bijection is expected to be compatible with the local Langlands correspondence
(loc. cit.). If G is quasi-split, the cocycles in the family ♮ are expected to be trivial.
9.3. An isomorphism for extended quotients. Let s0 and t0 be as in §7. Let
ιπ be as in Theorem 7.3 and f as in Theorem 7.1. Then for t ∈ Irrt (L(F )), since f
is equivariant with respect to ιπ by Theorem 7.3, we have
∼

ιπ |W s,t : W s,t −→ W s0 ,f(t) .
Each 2-cocycle ♮t , t ∈ Irrt (L(F )), therefore defines a 2-cocycle
♮0f(t) : W s0 ,f(t) × W s0 ,f(t) −→ C× .
The following theorem is then immediate from Theorem 7.3 and [18, Theorem 6.1].
Theorem 9.3. Suppose Hypothesis 5.1. Then there is an isomorphism
∼

lπ : (Irrt (L(F ))//W s )♮ −→ (Irrt0 (L0 (F ))//W s0 )♮0
determined by the choice of (S, θ).
Let (K, ρ) (resp. (K 0 , ρ0 ) be the type constructed by Kim and Yu for Rs (G(F ))
(resp. Rs0 (G0 (F ))). We have equivalences of categories:
∼

Rs (G(F )) −→ H(G, ρ∨ )−Mod,

∼

Rs0 (G0 (F )) −→ H(G0 , ρ∨
0 )−Mod.

Corollary 9.4. Suppose Hypothesis 5.1. Then for regular Bernstein blocks, Conjecture 1.1 implies the ABPS Conjecture.
Proof. For depth-zero Bernstein blocks, the ABPS conjecture holds by [25] and
Morris’s presentation of Hecke algebras of depth-zero blocks [19]. The result then
follows from Theorem 9.3.

Theorem 9.5. Assume Hypothesis 5.1. Assume that the twisted Levi subgroups
G0 ( . . . ( Gd = G obtained in the Howe factorization of (S, θ) in G are F -Levi
subgroups of G. Then the ABPS conjecture holds for the Bernstein block Rs (G(F )).
In particular, if the connected center of G0 is split modulo the center of G, then the
ABPS Conjecture holds. Therefore it also holds for principal series blocks of split
groups.
Proof. The first claim follows from Theorem 8.2 and Corollary 9.4. The last two
claims follow from Corollaries 8.3, 8.6 and 9.4.

Remark 9.6. When G is a classical group, Equation (1.3) for certain Bernstein
blocks can be observed from results of Kim [16]. More generally, for classical groups,
Heiermann [12] has established certain equivalences of categories in the spirit of
Equation (1.4). It would be worthwhile to understand the equivalence in terms of
Kim-Yu data.

10. Partial results toward further Hecke algebra isomorphisms
We prove weaker versions of the Hecke algebra isomorphism of Equation (1.3).
Let the notation be as in §7 and §9.3.
The equivalence
∼
Rs (G(F )) −→ H(G, ρ∨ )−Mod,
induces an isomorphism of Zs with the center of H(G, ρ∨ ). View H(G, ρ∨ ) as a
Zs -algebra. It is then finitely generated as a Zs -module. Similarly, H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ) is a
finitely generated module over its center Zs0 .
Write S = Zs \0 (resp. S0 = Zs0 \0) and let ks := S −1 Zs (resp. ks0 := S0−1 Zs0 )
denote the field of fractions of Zs (resp. Zs0 ). Write
H(G, ρ∨ ) := S −1 H(G, ρ∨ ).
Similarly,
−1
0 ∨
H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ) := S0 H(G , ρ0 ).
In [6, §4.3], Bushnell and Henniart define the notions of generic and simply
generic, which are generalizations of the generic representations in quasi-split groups.

Theorem 10.1. Assume Hypothesis 5.1. Assume that π|◦ L(F ) and π0 |◦ L0 (F ) are
multiplicity free. Then there is a vector-space isomorphism
∼

H(G, ρ∨ ) −→ H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ).
If s and s0 are simply generic, then there is a C-algebra isomorphism
∼

H(G, ρ∨ ) −→ H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ).
Proof. By [23, Prop. 1.8.4.1], H(G, ρ∨ ) (resp. H(G0 , ρ∨
0 )) is a free right-module
over Zt (resp. Zt0 ) of rank |W s | (resp. |W s0 |). By [18, Theorem 6.1], Zt ∼
= Zt0 and
s0
s ∼
by Theorem 7.3, W = W . The first claim is then immediate.
By [6, Theorem 5.2],
H(G, ρ∨ ) ∼
= Mn (ks ),
for some integer n. Similarly
∼ Mn (ks ),
H(G0 , ρ∨ ) =
0

0

0

∼
for some integer n0 . Since ks ∼
= ks0 by Theorem 7.4, to prove H(G, ρ∨ ) → H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ),
it suffices to prove
dimks H(G, ρ∨ ) = dimks0 H(G0 , ρ∨
0 ).
−1 t0
−1 t ∼
Now S Z = S0 Z by Theorem 7.4 and [18, Theorem 6.1]. The claim then
follows from [23, Prop. 1.8.4.1] .
