Within the framework of the Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics (LQMD) transport model,
the isospin effect in peripheral heavy-ion collisions has been investigated thoroughly. A coalescence approach is used for recognizing the primary fragments formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions.
The secondary decay process of the fragments is described by the statistical code, GEMINI. Production mechanism and isospin effect of the projectile-like and target-like fragments are analyzed
with the combined approach. It is found that the isospin migration from the high-isospin density to the low-density matter takes place in the neutron-rich nuclear reactions, i.e., 48 Ca+208 Pb,
86
Kr+48 Ca/208 Pb/124 Sn, 136 Xe+208 Pb, 124 Sn+124 Sn and 136 Xe+136 Xe. A hard symmetry energy
is available for creating the neutron-rich fragments, in particular in the medium-mass region. The
isospin effect of the neutron to proton (n/p) ratio of the complex fragments is reduced once including
the secondary decay process. However, a soft symmetry energy enhances the n/p ratio of the light
particles, in particular at the kinetic energies above 15 MeV/nucleon.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over past several decades, the quasi-fission or fast
fission dynamics in massive nuclear reactions attracted
much attention both in experiments and in theories [1–
4]. The characteristics of the quasi-fission reactions has
been extensively studied, in particular for understanding the formation mechanism of superheavy nuclei. The
composite system in the quasi-fission reactions persists
a long time scale of the relative energy dissipation and
nucleon transfer, in which the isospin dependent nucleonnucleon potential dominates the fragment formation. It
is well known the nuclear equation of state (EOS) is a
basic quantity for describing the nuclear matter with
the density and temperature. The cold EOS in the
isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is usually expressed
with the energy per nucleon as E(ρ, δ) = E(ρ, δ =
0) + Esym (ρ)δ 2 + O(δ 2 ) in terms of baryon density ρ and
isospin asymmetry δ = (ρn − ρp )/(ρn + ρp ). The symmetry energy Esym at the subsaturation densities is a
key ingredient in understanding the structure of weakly
bound nucleus, nuclear liquid-gas phase transition, nuclear boundary of the neutron-rich nuclide etc [5–8]. A
soft symmetry energy in the domain of subsaturation
densities has been extracted from the different observables in Fermi-energy (10-100 MeV/nucleon) heavy-ion
collisions [9–13]. Different mechanisms might coexist and
be correlated in heavy-ion collisions at the Fermi energies,
such as projectile or target fragmentation, neck dynamics
and fragment formation, preequilibrium emission of light
clusters (complex particles), fission of heavy fragments,
multifragmentation etc, in which the isospin dependent
nucleon-nucleon potential dominates the dynamical processes. Recently, the isospin effects of the intermediate
mass fragments (IMFs) from the neck fragmentation were

investigated thoroughly [14–16].
The observables in the quasi-fission or fast fission reactions are related to the isospin dependent mean-field
potential and have the long isospin relaxation time. As
a typical quantity, the neutron-to-proton ratios (N/Z) of
the fragments reflects the isospin diffusion in nucleusnucleus collisions. In this work, we investigate the
isospin dynamics of the fragment formation and decay
modes within the Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics (LQMD) transport model. In Sec. II we give a brief
description of the LQMD model. The isospin dissipation
dynamics and the symmetry energy effect are discussed
in Sec. III. Summary and perspective on the possible
measurements are presented in Sec. IV.

II. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE LQMD
MODEL

To understand the isospin dynamics in the medium
and high energy heavy-ion collisions, the LQMD transport model is developed on the issues of symmetry energy
at subnormal and suprasaturation densities, in-medium
nucleon-nucleon (NN) cross sections, isospin and momentum dependent NN potential, isospin effects on particle
production and transportation etc [17–20]. All possible reaction channels of the charge-exchange, elastic and
inelastic scatterings by distinguishing isospin effects in
hadron-hadron collisions were implemented in the model.
The temporal evolutions of the baryons (nucleons and
resonances) and mesons in the colliding system under
the self-consistently generated mean-field are described
by Hamilton’s equations of motion. The Hamiltonian
is constructed with the Skyrme-type interaction, which
consists of the relativistic energy and the effective in-

2
teraction potential. We do not take into account the
momentum-dependent potential in the Fermi-energy and
near barrier nuclear collisions for stabilizing the initial
nucleus. However, the momentum-dependent interaction
has to be included in the high-energy heavy-ion collisions, which reduces the effective nucleon mass in nuclear
medium.
The local potential can beR written with the energydensity functional as Uloc = Vloc (ρ(r))dr. The energydensity functional is expressed by

where ρn , ρp and ρ = ρn +ρp are the neutron, proton and
total densities, respectively, and δ = (ρn − ρp )/(ρn + ρp )

and ρ0 are taken to be -226.5 MeV, 173.7 MeV,
1.309, 23 MeV fm2 , -2.7 MeV fm2 and 0.16 fm−3 , respectively. These parameters lead to the compression modulus of K=230 MeV for isospin symmetric nuclear matter

where the coefficients γs =0.5, 1 and 2 correspond to the
soft, linear and hard symmetry energies, respectively.
The value of Csym =38 MeV results in the symmetry energy of 31.5 MeV at the normal nuclear density.
In the low-energy heavy-ion collisions, the fermionic
nature of nucleons and NN elastic scattering dominate
the nuclear dynamics and the fragment formation. The
treatment of the Pauli blocking in NN collisions is different in various transport models [21]. The purpose is
to reduce the collision probability for the quantal manybody system. In the LQMD model, the Pauli blocking
in NN collisions is embodied by the blocking probability
bij = 1 − (1 − fi )(1 − fj ) in two colliding nucleons i and
j compared with a random number. The isospin effect is
included in evaluation of the occupation probability by
fi =

The nuclear dynamics in the Fermi-energy heavy-ion
collisions is described by the LQMD model. The primary fragments are constructed in phase space with a
coalescence model, in which nucleons at freeze-out are
considered to belong to one cluster with the relative momentum smaller than P0 and with the relative distance
smaller than R0 (here P0 = 200 MeV/c and R0 = 3 fm)
[16]. The primary fragments are highly excited. The deexcitation of the fragments is described within the GEMINI code [23].

(3)

The rik = |ri − rk | and pik = |pi − pk | are the relative
distance of two nucleons in coordinate and momentum
spaces, respectively. The sum is satisfied to the conditions of rik < 2R0 and pik < 2P0 with R0 = 3.367fm and
P0 = 112.5 MeV/c. It is noticed that the overlap of hard
sphere in phase space is assumed by 16π 2 R03 P03 /9 = h3 /2.
The cross section of the NN elastic scattering is obtained
by fitting the available experimental data in the wide energy region [22].

The phase-space structure of fragments produced in
heavy-ion collisions provides the correlation and fluctuation of nuclear dynamics in the dissipation of relative
motion energy, nucleon transfer and isospin density. The
yields of the primary fragments in the peripheral HICs
almost exhibit a symmetric distribution in the projectilelike fragments (PLFs) or target-like fragments (TLFs)
owing to the same stripping and pick-up reaction rates.
The fragment spectra are influenced by both the dynamics mechanism and structure quantities. The proton and
neutron drifts in the different density region are driven
by the mean-field potential in nuclear medium. Shown
in Fig. 1 is the fragment distributions in the reactions
of 86 Kr+48 Ca/208 Pb and 136 Xe+136 Xe at the incident
energy of 20 MeV/nucleon in the peripheral collisions.
The parallel velocity VP AR is evaluated along the beam
direction in the center of mass frame and the positive
(negative) values corresponds to the PLFs (TLFs). It is
obvious that a number of fragments are created in the
vicinity of projectile or target velocity. The intermediate mass fragments (IMFs) are mainly produced in the
fragmentation reactions. The N/Z ratio of IMFs from
the neck fragmentation in Fermi-energy heavy-ion collisions was investigated for extracting the density dependent symmetry energy [14–16]. Shown in Fig. 2 is the
total kinetic energy (TKE) distribution of the primary
fragments in the reaction of 48 Ca+208 Pb within the collision centrality of 8-10 fm. The primary fragments are
constructed in phase space with a coalescence model, in
which nucleons at freeze-out are considered to belong to
one cluster with the relative momentum smaller than P0
and with the relative distance smaller than R0 (here P0
= 200 MeV/c and R0 = 3 fm) [16]. It is obvious that
the TKE spectra exhibit a symmetric structure. The
multinucleon transfer mechanism is available for creating
the medium-mass fragments with the charged numbers of
Z=30-60. The dissipation of relative motion energy and
nucleon transfer is more pronounced with decreasing the
incident energy.
The isospin dynamics of fast nucleons and light complex particles produced in Fermi-energy heavy-ion collisions has been investigated for extracting the symmetry

energy at subsaturation densities and the isospin splitting of nucleon effective mass in nuclear matter [24].
The pre-equilibrium nucleon emission in isotopic reaction
systems was measured at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (Michigan State University,
East Lansing, MI, USA) [25]. The production of fragments is calculated within the combined approach of the
LQMD transport model for the primary fragments and
the GEMINI statistical decay code for the de-excitation
process [23]. The de-excitation of fragments with the
charge number Z>6 is considered. The light fragments
are only counted from the preequilibrium emission in nuclear collisions. The excitation energy with Z>6 is evaluated from the binding energy difference of the primary
fragment and the ground state evaluated from the liquid
drop model. Shown in Fig. 3 is the total multiplicities
and neutron/proton ratios of heavy fragments produced
in the peripheral collisions of 78,86 Kr + 208 Pb at the beam
energy of 20 MeV/nucleon. The isospin effect is weakened via the decay process, in particular in the heavy
mass domain owing to larger excitation energy. It is

pronounced a hard symmetry energy is favorable for the
formation of neutron-rich isotopes. However, the yields
are weakly influenced the stiffness of symmetry energy.
The de-excitation of primary fragments moves the spectra to the light mass region. It has been investigated that
the peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions have the advantage for creating the neutron-rich isotopes [26]. Shown
in Fig. 4 is a comparison of different symmetry energy
on the fragment distribution in the symmetric reaction
136
Xe+136 Xe at the incident energy of 20 MeV/nucleon.
The ’inverse quasi-fission process’ leads to the one-bump
structure. Moreover, the fragment yields are almost independent the stiffness of symmetry energy. However,
the average neutron/proton ratios of isotopic fragments
exhibit an obvious isospin effect in the wide mass region.
The conclusions are helpful for extracting the symmetry
energy from the quasi-fission fragments at INFN-LNS Superconducting Cyclotron of Catania (Italy) [27].
Systematic comparison of the n/p ratios of the primary and secondary fragments from different reaction
systems is shown in Fig. 5. The isospin effect is obvi-

ous in the spectra of primary fragments, which directly
brings the mean-field information. The hard symmetry
energy results in the larger n/p ratio in the fragment
formation because of the weaker repulsive force for neutrons in the neutron-rich matter, which is available for
the neutron-rich isotope formation in peripheral heavyion collisions. To realize the cold fragments observed in
experiments, we implemented the GEMINI code into the
primary fragments. The isospin effect is weakened via
the de-excitation process, in particular in the heavy-mass
domain. The neutron-rich isotopes have smaller neutron
separation energies. The statistical decay reduces the
hN/Zi with the hard symmetry energy. However, the
primary proton-rich fragments formed with the soft symmetry energy might be decayed via the proton or neutron
emission. Shown in Fig. 6 is the kinetic energy spectra of
the neutron/proton ratios from the ’gas-phase’ fragments
(nucleons, hydrogen and helium isotopes) produced in
collisions of 136 Xe+208 Pb, 86 Kr+124 Sn and 124 Sn+124 Sn
at the energy of 20 MeV/nucleon, respectively. The symmetry energy effect is more pronounced for the neutronrich system. The bump structure of the primary fragments around the energy of 15 MeV/nucleon is caused
from the competition of free nucleons and light fragments
to the n/p ratios. The light fragments with Z≤2 are
mainly produced at the low kinetic energy and have the

smaller n/p ratios in comparison to the free nucleons. At
the kinetic energies above 30 MeV/nucleon, the n/p ratios are mainly contributed from the free nucleons. The
difference of the hard (γs =2) and soft (γs =0.5) symmetry
energies is obvious in the whole energy range. Opposite
trend to the hN/Zi ratio of IMFs and heavy fragments,
the soft symmetry energy enhances the yield ratios because of more repulsive force for neutrons in dynamical
evolution.
The isospin dissipation in peripheral heavy-ion collisions is related to the incident energy. The composite
system maintains more temporal relaxation with decreasing the energy, in which the isospin-dependent singleparticle potential impacts the nucleon dynamics and the
fragment formation. Shown in Fig. 7 is a comparison
of different energy on the hN/Zi ratios of fragments produced in the 136 Xe + 136 Xe reaction. A large hN/Zi
value is obtained with the hard symmetry energy at 15
MeV/nucleon. The isospin effect is still pronounced after including the statistical decay. The dependence of
the kinetic energy spectra of ’gas-phase’ n/p ratio on
the incident energy is small as shown in Fig. 8. The
correlation measurement of the hN/Zi ratios from the
heavy fragments and the n/p yield ratios from the ’gasphase’ particles is helpful in constraining the symmetry
energy at subsaturation densities and the synthesis of

5
densities. Further experiments are expected for extracting the subnormal symmetry energy from the medium
fragments.

the low-energy nuclear collisions [28].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Within the LQMD transport model, we have investigated the isospin dynamics in the peripheral heavy-ion
collisions at Fermi energies. The n/p spectra from the
gas-phase particles and from the PLFs and TLFs are analyzed thoroughly. The average n/p ratios of the IMFs
and heavy fragments are sensitive to the stiffness of symmetry energy because of the existence of isospin density
gradient in dissipative collisions. The hard symmetry
energy is available for producing the neutron-rich fragments. However, the isospin effect is reduced after implementing the statistical decay owing to the binary fission
and the light particle evaporation. The larger n/p yield
ratios of the ’gas phase’ particles are obtained with the
soft symmetry energy because of the repulsive interaction enforced on neutrons in the region of sub-saturation
