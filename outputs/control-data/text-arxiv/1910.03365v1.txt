Abstract—A well-known challenge in beamforming is how to
optimally utilize the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the array to
design a robust beamformer, especially when the array DoF is
smaller than the number of sources in the environment. In this
paper, we leverage the tool of constrained convex optimization
and propose a penalized inequality-constrained minimum variance (P-ICMV) beamformer to address this challenge. Specifically, we propose a beamformer with a well-targeted objective
function and inequality constraints to achieve the design goals.
The constraints on interferences penalize the maximum gain of
the beamformer at any interfering directions. This can efficiently
mitigate the total interference power regardless of whether
the number of interfering sources is less than the array DoF
or not. Multiple robust constraints on the target protection
and interference suppression can be introduced to increase the
robustness of the beamformer against steering vector mismatch.
By integrating the noise reduction, interference suppression, and
target protection, the proposed formulation can efficiently obtain
a robust beamformer design while optimally trade off various
design goals. When the array DoF is fewer than the number
of interferences, the proposed formulation can effectively align
the limited DoF to all of the sources to obtain the best overall
interference suppression. To numerically solve this problem, we
formulate the P-ICMV beamformer design as a convex secondorder cone program (SOCP) and propose a low complexity
iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM). Three applications are simulated to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Beamforming is a fundamental technique in array signal
processing, which exploits the spatial degrees of freedom
(DoF) to enhance the desired signal and suppress undesired
interferences and noise. The beamforming technique has been
widely used in many multi-channel signal processing areas,
i.e., wireless communication [3], microphone array speech

processing [4], radar [5], sonar [6], medical imaging [7], and
etc. The key procedure in beamforming is specifying the so
called beamformer, which serves as a complex coefficient
vector to linearly combine signals received by array elements.
In the past decades, various beamformer design criteria has
been extensively studied, these criteria can be divided into
two types: data-independent and data-dependent criteria. The
performance of data-independent beamformers [8]–[10] is limited due to the missing knowledge of the signal environment.
Instead, the data-dependent beamformers can deliver optimal
performance due to their adaptivity to the signal environment
statistics and, as such, they are also referred as adaptive
beamformers. One representative adaptive beamformer is the
minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer [11], which has been widely used in applications
due to its convenience of practical implementation as well
as its theoretical guarantee to maximize the output signal-tointerference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) .
However, the performance of the MVDR beamformer suffers a degradation due to the imperfect knowledge of practical environment, i.e., imprecise steering vectors (SV), finite
number of snapshots, direction-of-arrival (DoA) errors, etc.
Generally speaking, these imperfections lead to two types of
model uncertainties of the MVDR beamformer. One uncertainty is the mismatch of SV of the target signal due to array
calibration error and DoA error of the target signal. This can
lead to inevitable distortion of the target signal. The other
uncertainty lies in the estimation error of the covariance matrix
of interference plus noise, which is often caused by the finite
number of data samples, the presence of the target signal in
the training samples, and the non-stationarity of signals. Such
uncertainty can not only lead to a degradation on suppressing
interference and noise, but also distort the target signal if it is
present in the training data samples. Facing with the above two
types of uncertainties, various robustness beamformers were
proposed and studied in the past four decades, to mitigate the
negative effects of one or both of the uncertainties.
A comprehensive review of the principles for minimum
variance robust adaptive beamforming technique was reported
in [12]. Here after, we briefly review several representative
robust beamforming techniques. To handle the uncertainty
of SV, the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV)
beamformer [13] enforces multiple distortionless constraints
on possible DoAs of the target signal. Though the LCMV
beamformer stabilizes the mainlobe response for possible
target DoAs, it does use up the DoF resource that could

2

be otherwise used for suppressing interference and noise.
Instead of enforcing multiple equality constraints, uncertainty
set based beamformers [14]–[17] model the mismatch part of
the SV lies in a bounded spherical or ellipsoidal, where the
mainlobe is stabilized by a worst-case optimization criterion
[14]–[16] or by iteratively estimating the SV [17] from the
uncertainty set. Another way for mitigating the uncertainty
of SV is the eigenspace based beamformers [18]–[20], which
modify the SV by projecting it onto the estimated signal-plusinterference subspace. The eigenspace based beamformers
suffer from noise corrosion when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
is low.
To handle the uncertainty of the covariance matrix, several
robust techniques are proposed by reconstructing the sample
covariance matrix. The well known one is the diagonal loading
(DL) based beamformer [21]–[23], which modify the sample
covariance matrix by adding a diagonal matrix. As the DL
beamformer though only modifies the covariance matrix, it
also enable to mitigate the impact of SV mismatch [15]. However, its performance may degrade in high SINR situation if the
target signal is presented in training data samples. Recently,
several covariance matrix reconstruction based beamformers
were proposed [24]–[26], these beamformers exploit the a
priori knowledge of the array manifold to reconstruct the
interference-plus-noise covariance matrix and estimate the SV
of the target signal. But the covariance matrix reconstruction
procedure are based on integration operation over specified angle regions, which requires a large computation cost especially
for large size array and 2-dimensional angle space.
In this paper, we utilize the convex optimization technique
to revisit the robust beamformer design problem. We propose a
penalized inequality-constraint minimum variance (P-ICMV)
beamformer based on the min-max criteria and also develop
an efficient optimization algorithm for solving the problem.
We summarize our contributions as follows:
(1) Various robustness considerations: The P-ICMV beamformer is robust against three kinds of errors caused by
different uncertainties in practice, including the DoA error, the
SV mismatch error, and the covariance matrix estimation error.
Precisely, two types of inequality constraints (one for preserving target signal and the other for suppressing interferences)
for controlling spatial responses around different directions
are introduced to provide robustness against DoA error. In
the presence of SV mismatch, these inequality constraints
also imply bounded spatial responses, and the impact of SV
mismatch is controlled by controlling the `2 norm of beamfomer. In addition, those inequality constraints for interference
suppression further provide an efficient suppression guarantee
when the covariance matrix of interference-plus-noise are
badly estimated or even unavailable.
(2) Intelligent DoF allocation: To allow a feasible beamformer
design under various robustness considerations, the P-ICMV
beamformer utilizes a penalization strategy to intelligently
allocate the limited array DoF. By penalizing different terms
in the objective of the P-ICMV formulation, the limited
array DoF can be intelligently allocated for achieving noise
reduction, interference suppression and target protection with
robustness. Specifically, the spatial responses on all possible

directions of interferences are penalized, enabling the PICMV beamformer to handle any number of interferences with
robustness. In particular, the number of inequality constraints
for suppressing interferences is no longer limited by the array
DoF. In addition, the worst-case distortion of the target signal
is bounded by the proposed inequality constraints. By aligning different values of the pre-defined parameters, different
priorities among noise reduction, interference suppression and
target protection can be achieved.
(3) Flexible robustness adjustment: From the point of dealing
with different kinds of robustness situations, the P-ICMV
beamformer contains a set of user-specified parameters which
allow a flexible robust beamformer design. Specifically, different levels of DoA errors can be handled by specifying the sizes
of angle regions covered by inequality constraints, different
allowable target signal distortions can be controlled by the
parameters in target protection inequality constraints, different
suppressing preferences among interferences can be achieved
by adjusting parameters involved in the min-max criterion,
and different levels of array calibration errors can be dealt by
controlling the `2 norm of beamformer.
(4) An efficient optimization algorithm: From the optimization
point of view, the P-ICMV formulation is a convex second
order cone programing (SOCP), which can be solved by the
well known interior point method [27]. However, facing with
the rapid progress of digital technique, beamforming with a
large-size array or limited computation capacity arise in lots of
applications and computationally more efficient optimization
algorithm is necessary. Hence, we also develop a low complexity iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving the PICMV formulation. Compared to the interior point method
which has a computation complexity in the a polynomial
order of array size, the developed algorithm only requires a
computation complexity of quadratic order per iteration.
We adopt the following notations in this paper. Lower and
upper case letters in bold are used for vectors and matrices
respectively. For a given matrix X, we denote its transpose
and Hermitian transpose by XT and XH respectively. If X
is a square matrix, we use λmin (X) and λmax (X) to denote
its smallest and largest eigenvalue respectively, use X  0
(X  0) to denote that it is a positive definite (semi-definite)
matrix, and use X−1 to denote its inverse (if exists). For a
given complex number c, we use Re{c} and Im{c} to denote
its real part and imaginary part respectively, and use ∠c to
denote the angle of c. We use kxk to denote Euclidean (`2 )
norm of the vector x. E [·] is used to represent the expectation
operation. The notation I represents the identity matrix with
an appropriate size, and the M -dimensional real (complex)
vector space is denoted by RM (CM ).

II. S IGNAL M ODEL
Consider an array with M omni-directional array elements.
There are K + 1 statistically independent narrow-band signal
sources at different directions θk , k = 0, 1, . . . , K (θk 6=

3

θk0 , ∀k 6= k 0 ). The signals received by the array at time n =
1, 2, . . . , can be modeled as,
x(n) = s0 (n)aθ0 +

K
X

sk (n)aθk + v(n) ∈ CM ,

(1)

k=1

where sk (n) ∈ C is the k-th source signal at discrete time
instance n, aθk ∈ CM is the SV associating with direction
θk , and v(n) ∈ CM is the noise. Suppose s0 (n) is the target
signal and others are unwanted signal, (1) can be simplified
as
x(n) = s0 (n)aθ0 + u(n) ∈ CM ,
(2)
PK
where u(n) = k=1 sk (n)aθk + v(n) is the unwanted signal.
The beamforming technique linearly combines x(n) by a socalled beamformer w ∈ CM such that the beamforming output
signal
z(n) = wH x(n)
(3)
satisfies a specified requirement, e.g., maximize the signal-tointerference plus noise ratio (SINR) of z(n).
With the a priori knowledge of the target signal’s SV aθ0 ,
the well-known MVDR beamformer attempts to minimize the
undesired signal power at beamforming output subject to a
distortionless constraint on the array response at direction θ0 .
The MVDR beamformer formulation is


min E |wH u(n)|2
(4a)
w

s.t. wH aθ0 = 1.

(4b)

Linear constraint (4b) guarantees s0 (n) being preserved in
z(n) without any distortion and the objective function in (4a)
can be further expressed as


E |wH u(n)|2 = wH Ru w,
(5)


where Ru , E u(n)uH (n) is the covariance matrix of u(n).
By the Lagrange multiplier method [28], the optimal solution
of problem (4) is
w∗ =

R−1
u aθ0
.
H
aθ0 R−1
u aθ0

(6)

Though the MVDR beamformer w∗ theoretically guarantees
a maximal SINR at the beamforming output [29], its performance could degrade significantly in practice due to:
(1) Inaccuracy of Ru : The exact covariance matrix Ru is
usually unavailable in most applications and it usually requires
to be estimated from finite N training data samples. Several
covariance matrix estimation approaches [21]–[26] were proposed to reduce the estimation error or improve the robustness
against the imprecise knowledge of the statistic property of the
undesired signal u(n).
(2) Mismatch of aθ0 : Linear constraint (4b) is motivated by
the array signal model (2) to preserve s0 (n) in z(n) without
distortion. In practice, aθ0 needs to be estimated and can be
inaccurate. The mismatch of aθ0 would lead to undesirable
target signal distortion. Further, together with the appearance
of target signal in the training data samples, signal cancellation
phenomenon [30] would bring a heavy target signal distortion.

Generally speaking, robustness against the mismatch of
aθ0 has been widely studied in the past decades, which
can be achieved by exploiting the a priori knowledge of
aθ0 . However, robustness against the inaccuracy of Ru is
usually considered in an estimation or reconstruction manner
[21]–[26], which relies on the interference-plus-noise data
samples. Instead, the possibility and advantages of enforcing additional constraints for interference suppression with
robustness require to be further explored. Suppressing interferences by proper inequality constraints not only provides
robustness against the inaccuracy of Ru , but also enables to
design robust beamformers in sample-free situations where
the estimation/reconstruction based beamformers are unable
to handle. For example, interference suppression with only
noise samples being available, or synthesizing beam pattern
with prescribed nulls [31]. However, the major challenge
for enforcing interference suppression constraints lies in the
limitation of DoF provided by the array. For the LCMV
beamfomer or other linear constraints based beamformers [32],
[33], the number of linear constraints in general should no
more than the number of array elements; otherwise it render
the optimization problem infeasible. Such limitation on the
number of linear constraints blocks the further exploration
of using linear constraints for interference suppression with
robustness.
On the other hand, recent research [34], [35] in speech
enhancement applications introduced the approach to relax
the equality constraints into inequality ones, and proposed a
so-named inequality constrained minimum variance (ICMV)
beamformer. Although the ICMV beamformer may also be
limited by the number of constraints, the flexibility of inequality constraints provides a potential way for overcoming
limitation on the number of constraints. In the next section, we
will present our proposed P-ICMV beamformer formulation,
which includes two types of inequality constraints and a
penalized objective function. A key advantage of P-ICMV
beamformer is its ability to effectively handle arbitrary number
of interferences with robustness on the best effort basis regardless of array DoF. Further, it also provides a flexible robustness
adjustment to design beamformers for different situations.
III. P ROPOSED P-ICMV B EAMFORMER D ESIGN
To address the mismatch of SVs and inaccuracy of covariance matrix, we firstly introduce two types of inequality
constraints in subsections III-A and III-B respectively. Then
we propose a min-max criterion to deal with the limitation of
DoF in subsection III-C, and the final P-ICMV beamformer
formulation is given in subsection III-D.
A. Robustness against Steering Vector Mismatch
To handle the SV mismatch, we relax equality constraint
(4b) into inequality version and control distortion within a
certain level. Specifically, for a given direction θ, equality
constraint wH aθ = 1 is relaxed to
|wH aθ − 1| + δkwk ≤ cθ ,

(7)

4

where cθ ≥ 0 is a user-defined tolerable distortion threshold
with respect to θ and δ ≥ 0 is a pre-defined parameter
for controlling the true spatial response. Notice that in the
presence of SV mismatch,
aθ = āθ + ∆aθ ,
where āθ is the true SV and ∆aθ is the perturbation vector,
precisely specifying the true spatial response wH āθ is a
difficult task as ∆aθ is unknown. Unlike the worst-case
optimization [14]–[16] or steering vector re-estimation [17]
approaches where the true spatial response wH āθ is uncontrollable. Inequality (7) implies a controllable target signal
distortion, under a general assumption that the `2 norm of
∆aθ is bounded, i.e., k∆aθ k ≤ δ with δ > 0. The target
distortion is represented in terms of |wH āθ − 1| and its bound
implied from (7) is given in Proposition 1.
Proposition 1. Suppose aθ = āθ + ∆aθ , k∆aθ k ≤ δ, and
|wH aθ − 1| + δkwk ≤ cθ , then |wH āθ − 1| ≤ cθ .
Proof. By applying the triangle and the Cauchy−Schwarz
inequalities, we can proof Proposition 1. We first apply the
triangle inequality,
|wH aθ − 1| = |wH (āθ + ∆aθ ) − 1|
≥ |wH āθ − 1| − |wH ∆aθ |.

(8)

Then, together with (8) and Cauchy−Schwarz inequality for
|wH ∆aθ | ≤ δkwk, we have
|wH āθ − 1| ≤ |wH aθ − 1| + δkwk ≤ cθ

(9)

This completes the proof.
Since the DoA θ0 contains estimation error, we propose to
introduce multiple inequality constraints at nearby angles of θ0
to improve robustness. Let Θ be a pre-specified discrete angle
set, which specifies a desired angle aperture around the target
to handle the DoA error, i.e., Θ = θ0 + {−5◦ , 0◦ , 5◦ }. Finally,
we propose robust constraints for protecting target signal as
follows:
|wH aθ − 1| + δkwk ≤ cθ , ∀θ ∈ Θ,

(10)

Inequality constraints (10) try to form a wide aperture beam
around θ0 to robustly protect the target signal, and the true
spatial response for each θ ∈ Θ is bounded (Proposition 1).
B. Robustness against Inaccurate Estimation of Ru
There are two ways to improve the robustness to the
inaccurate estimation of Ru . One is to exploit the inherent
structure of Ru and develop an efficient estimator for Ru
from finite samples, like covariance matrix reconstruction
approaches [24]–[26]. The other approach is to exploit the a
priori knowledge of the presumed steering vectors for interferences and impose robust constraints to suppress interferences
even without Ru . Following the second way, we propose to
impose the following inequality constraints for interference
suppression,
|wH aφ | + δkwk ≤ cφ , ∀φ ∈ Φk , ∀k,

(11)

where Φk is a pre-defined discrete angle set for the interference k based on the corresponding DoA estimation θk , i.e.,
Φk = θk + {−5◦ , 0◦ , 5◦ }, and cφ ≥ 0 specifies an allowable
amplification for angle φ. Similar to Proposition 1, constraints
(11) implies an upper bound for the true spatial response
wH āφ given in Proposition 2.
Proposition 2. Suppose aφ = āφ + ∆aφ (k∆aφ k ≤ δ) and
|wH aφ | + δkwk ≤ cφ , then |wH āφ | ≤ cφ .
Proof. Similar to the proof for Proposition 1, applying the
triangle and Cauchy−Schwarz inequalities can complete this
proof.
Intuitively, constraints (11) try to form a sufficiently wide
and bounded null at nearby angles of φk , which can suppress interferences with robustly regardless the estimation
quality of Ru . The MVDR formulation (4) can be modified
by replacing constraint (4b) with constraints (10) and (11),
leading to a robust beamformer design. Such beamformer
(with δ = 0) was recently proposed and studied in [2], [34],
named as ICMV beamformer in short. However, the ICMV
beamformer also suffers from a design feasibility issue, i.e.,
the ICMV formulation may not be feasible when the number
of constraints is larger than the number of array elements. In
fact, the design of beamformer under limited DoF condition
is not just a challenge for the ICMV, but also for other
multiple constraints based beamformer design like the LCMV
beamformer or other linear constraints based beamformers
[32], [33]. The key question is whether there is a feasible
way to impose arbitrary number of robust constraints when
the number of array elements is fixed? In what follows, we
provide a positive answer affirmatively by proposing a minmax
robust beamforming formulation.
C. Limited DoF
In this subsection, we introduce a penalization criterion
for constraints (11). The proposed design criterion always
enables a feasible beamformer design (under mild conditions,
see Proposition 3) while suppressing multiple interferences
robustly. From the physical meaning of constraints (11), we
know they attempt to bound the spatial responses at several
potential angles of interferences. Instead of specifying fixed
levels cφ which could cause a design feasibility issue, we introduce an extra optimization variable  = [1 , 2 , . . . , K ]T ∈
RK on the right hand sides of constraints (11) to control the
levels of spatial responses. We propose the following min-max
optimization criterion for suppressing multiple interferences in
a robust manner:
min max{γk k } + Other objectives
w,

k
H

s.t. |w aφ | + δkwk ≤ k cφ , ∀φ ∈ Φk , ∀k,

(12)

Other feasible constraints.
In (12), {γk } are user-specified interference suppression parameters, interference with larger γk has higher priority to
be suppressed. Suppose cφ > 0, ∀φ ∈ Φk , ∀k, criterion (12)
always enables a feasible design for w by setting the values
of {k } large enough.

5

D. Proposed P-ICMV Beamformer
Finally, combine the discussions in Subsections III-A, III-B,
and III-C, the proposed P-ICMV formulation is
min wH Rw + µ max{γk k }
w,

k

(13)

s.t. |wH aθ − 1| + δkwk ≤ cθ , ∀θ ∈ Θ,
H

|w aφ | + δkwk ≤ k cφ , ∀φ ∈ Φk , ∀k.
In (13), R can be the estimated noise-only covariance matrix
or the estimated noise-plus-interference correlation matrix, and
µ ≥ 0 is a trade-off parameter for noise and interference
suppression. The P-ICMV formulation (13) has an extra
optimization variable  which makes the upper bound on
|wH aφ | adjustable. The number of constraints for interference
suppression is no longer limited by the DoF. The feasibility
can be achieved by setting  large enough. Thus if constraints
for angle θ ∈ Θ are nonempty, the P-ICMV beamformer is
able to generate a feasible design with bounded distortion for
arbitrary number of interferences. To strictly ensure P-ICMV
formulation (13) being able to handle arbitrary number of interferences with bounded distortion, we provide the following
sufficient condition in Proposition 3.
Proposition 3. Let A ∈ CM ×|Θ| be the matrix stacked by
aθ , ∀θ ∈ Θ, suppose rank(A) = |Θ| and δ ≤ √ HminHθ cθ −1 .

Then problem (13) is always feasible.
Proof. Consider the value of kwk subject to AH w = b,
where b ∈ C|Θ| is a complex vector. By the method of LaH

the proof.

beamformer with different considerations. In addition, several
existing beamformers, i.e., MVDR, LCMV and DL beamformers, can be regarded as special cases of the P-ICMV
formulation, with proper settings for these model parameters.
Furthermore, though the P-ICMV formulation is proposed for
adaptive beamforming purpose, it can also be used to design
a specified static beam pattern by setting R = 0. We illustrate
several static beam pattern designs by the P-ICMV formulation
in Subsection V-C.

IV. ADMM A LGORITHM FOR P-ICMV B EAMFORMER
Problem (13) is actually a convex second-order cone program (SOCP), and the well-studied interior point method [27]
can be used to solve it. However, the computational efficiency
of the interior point method is too high in many adaptive
beamforming applications such as in an embedded system
with limited processing [4], [34], [35]. Recent theoretical
progress on the convergence and convergence analysis [36]
for the ADMM algorithm provides an alternative way to solve
problem (13) in an efficient manner. In this section, we first
reformulate (13) as a convex SOCP with smooth objective
function and then develop a low computational complexity
algorithm to solve it using the ADMM algorithm.
By introducing extra optimization variables t ∈ R and y ∈
R, problem (13) is equivalently reformulated as
min wH Rw + µt

w,t,y

s.t. |wH aθ − 1| + δy ≤ cθ , ∀θ ∈ Θ,
|wH aφ | + δy ≤ tcφ /γk , ∀φ ∈ Φk , ∀k,

In short, we summarize several interesting properties of the
P-ICMV formulation (13) in the following Remarks.
Remark 1 (Bounded Spatial Responses). By Propositions 1
and 2, if k∆aθ k ≤ δ, then any feasible solution (w, ) of
problem (13) has a bounded signal distortion, 1 − cθ ≤
|wH āθ | ≤ 1 + cθ , ∀θ ∈ Θ. Similarly, spatial response for each
interference is softly bounded by an adjustable parameter k ,
|wH āφ | ≤ k cφ , ∀φ ∈ Φk .
Remark 2 (DoF Allocation). Penalty function µ maxk {γk k }
enables P-ICMV beamformer to intelligently allocate DoF
to suppress the intended interference with larger weight γk .
This allows selective interference suppression, i.e., larger
weight can be applied on interferences with higher degree of
annoyance.
In practice, the level of robustness can differ in situations,
e.g., more robustness on DoA errors should be introduced
if DoA estimations are bad, more robustness on SD are
necessary if preserving target signal is the central task. Hence,
an appropriate robust beamformer should enable different
robustness preferences in different situations. Recall the PICMV formulation (13), it has several model parameters to
be specified, i.e., Θ, {Φk }, {cθ }, {cφ }, {γk }, µ, δ, these parameters provide a wide range for users to design a robust

(14)

kwk ≤ y.
Notice that problems (13) and (14) have the same optimal
w∗ , and the optimal ∗k , ∀k for problem (13) can be extracted
from the optimal (w∗ , y ∗ , t∗ ) for problem (14), given as
∗
∗
∗
∗
maxφ∈Φk {(|aH
φ w | + δy )/cφ } ≤ k ≤ t /γk . To derive
the ADMM algorithm for problem (14), we first introduce
auxiliary variables {yθ , zθ } and {yφ , zφ } as
yθ = y, zθ = wH aθ , ∀θ ∈ Θ,
H

yφ = y, zφ = w aφ , ∀φ ∈ Φk , ∀k.

(15a)
(15b)

Then, problem (14) can be equivalently reformulated as
min wH Rw + µt
s.t.

|zθ − 1| + δyθ ≤ cθ , ∀θ ∈ Θ,

(16a)

|zφ | + δyφ ≤ tcφ /γk , ∀φ ∈ Φk , ∀k,

(16b)

kwk ≤ y,

The convergence behavior of the above ADMM iterations is

Proposition 4. Suppose Proposition 3 holds, then iterates

Next, we derive closed-form solutions for subproblems
(17a), (17b) and (17c) at each iteration r. We drop the iteration

the solutions for subproblems (17b) and (17c), we first give
Lemma 1, which provides a closed-form solution for a special
type of complex SOCP problem.

Subproblem (17b) is separable over each (yθ , zθ ), θ ∈ Θ.
Thus each optimal (yθ∗ , zθ∗ ), θ ∈ Θ can be obtained by
individually solving the following problem, given as

where aθ , bθ , αθ , and βθ are
ρ
aθ = αθ = , bθ = −λθ − ρwH aθ , βθ = −ηθ − ρy.

Problem (22) is a complex SOCP with respect to (yθ , zθ ).
It has the same mathematical form as the SOCP studied in

7

Lemma 1. Specify a = aθ , b = bθ , c = cθ , α = αθ , β = βθ ,
ψθ = ∠(2aθ + bθ ), and d = 1, we can obtain the closed-form

(yθ , zθ ) which has a complexity of O(1). The overall complexity, for all θ ∈ Θ, is O((M + 1)|Θ|) per iteration.

2
Problem (24) is a convex SOCP with respect to t and all
(yφ , zφ ). By exploiting its special problem structure, we can
also solve it in closed-form. In what follows, we will present
the way to exploit problem structure to obtain the closed-form
solution. For any fixed t̄ ∈ R, problem (24) is separable over
each (yφ , zφ ), ∀φ ∈ Φk , ∀k, given as

s.t. |zφ | + δyφ ≤ t̄cφ /γk .
According Lemma 1, the closed-form for optimal (yφ∗ , zφ∗ ) can
be obtained by specifying b = bφ , c = t̄cφ /γk , α = αφ ,
β = βφ , ψφ = ∠bφ , and d = 0, ∀φ ∈ Φk , ∀k, given as

Notice (yφ∗ , zφ∗ ) is a function of t̄, which implies problem (25)
can be reduced to an optimization problem with respect to
a single variable t. Hence, the question becomes how to find
optimal t∗ for the reduced problem. In Lemma 3, we first give
the equivalent optimization problem with respect to t, and then
in Proposition 5, we show that the optimal t∗ can be obtained
by sorting a set of real numbers.

by solving the following unconstrained convex problem (27)

Further, f (t) is a smooth convex function.
Proof. Substituting (26) into (25) can complete the proof.
Proposition 5. Let {t̃` } be an increasing sequence consisted
by all {t̄φ,1 } and {t̄φ,2 }, denote ∂f (t) as the derivative of

Proof. By Lemma 3, ∂f (t) can be rewritten as
X X
∂f (t) =
min{2aφ,1 t + bφ,1 , 2aφ,2 t + bφ,2 , 0}. (31)

By (29) and (31), we know ∂f (t) is a strictly increasing
and continuous function for t ≤ maxφ {t̄φ,2 } , tmax and
∂f (t) = 0 for t ≥ tmax . By the first order optimality condition
(the optimal t∗ has gradient −µ), problem (27) must have a
unique optimal solution t∗ ≤ tmax such that ∂f (t∗ ) = −µ.
Notice ∂f (t) is a piecewise linear function, the optimal t∗
lies on some region with ∂f (t) = 2at + b and 2at∗ + b = −µ,
where a > 0, b ∈ R are coefficients to be determined. By
(31), if ∂f (tmin ) > −µ, tmin , minφ {t̄P

sequence {t̃` } and by the strictly increasing property of ∂f (t),
the region for ∂f (t∗ ) = −µ must be t̃` ≤ t∗ ≤ t̃`+1 , where
∂f (t̃` ) ≤ −µ and ∂f (t̃`+1 ) ≥ −µ. In such a case, we have

Combining the two cases and setting t∗ = − b+µ

the proof.

Output: The P-ICMV beamformer w∗ .

V. N UMERICAL S IMULATION
In this section, we consider the application of the proposed
P-ICMV beamformer in three different scenarios in order to
demonstrate its effectiveness. The first is robust adaptive beamforming with antenna array, which is widely used in radar and
wireless communication systems. The major challenge for this
application is how to robustly handle various errors, including
DoA error, SV mismatch error, and covariance estimation
error. The robustness of the P-ICMV beamformer against
these errors is demonstrated. The second scenario is speech
enhancement with microphone array in hearing aids, where the
major difficulty is handling multiple interfering speakers with
limited number of microphones. The efficiency of suppressing
multiple interferences with few number of microphones is
verified. The third scenario is beam pattern synthesis for large
size array. A specified beam pattern for a 30 × 30 antenna
array is synthesized, where tens of thousands of constraints
are needed to achieve the desired beam pattern. The ability of

the P-ICMV formulation to synthesize a desired beam pattern
and the efficiency of the proposed ADMM algorithm have
been confirmed. For all simulations, the ADMM algorithm
stops when both the primal-dual feasibility gap and residual
[37] less than 10−5 or the number of iterations exceed 103 .
A. Robust Adaptive Beamforming with Antenna Array
We consider a uniform linear antenna array of M = 20
elements with half wave length spacing. The desired signal is
at θ0 = −5◦ , and three interfering signals are at θ1 = −60◦ ,
θ2 = −20◦ and θ3 = 45◦ respectively. For each interfering
signal, the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) is fixed at 30
dB. The covariance matrix R is estimated by averaging a
finite number of training snapshots, and the desired signal
is always present in the snapshots. In all simulations, both
the DoA error and the array calibration error are present.
Specifically, we assume the estimated DoA θ̂k for each source
k is uniformly drawn from U(θk −2◦ , θk +2◦ ). The calibration
error is caused by gain and phase perturbation. For each
antenna element, the gain and phase perturbation is randomly
generated from N (1, 0.022 ) and N (0, (0.01π)2 ) respectively.
The beamforming output SINR is used as performance metric
and we study the output SINR under different input SNR
and number of snapshots conditions. For each simulation
condition, the output SINR is averaged by 100 independent
Monte Carlo runs.
Four representative robust beamformers in the literature
are selected for comparison. One beamformer is the loading
sample matrix inversion (LSMI) beamformer [23], with the
loading factor set as 10λmin (R). The second beamformer is
the worst-case beamformer [14] and the robust parameter  in
[14] is set to be 3. The third beamformer is the eigenspace
beamformer [19] where the number of interferences is assumed to be exactly known. The last beamformer is the SV
estimation beamformer [38], whereby parameter of desired
signal region is specified as [θ̂0 − 8◦ , θ̂0 + 8◦ ]. For the PICMV beamformer, the discrete angle set Θ is specified as
Θ = θ̂0 +{−2◦ , −1◦ , 0◦ , 1◦ , 2◦ }. The corresponding parameter
cΘ is cΘ = {6, 4, 2, 4, 6} × 10−1 . In such a case, the
sufficient condition in Proposition 3 for δ is about δ ≤ 0.24.
Similarly, the angle set Φk for each interfering signal k is
selected from the region [−4◦ , 4◦ ], for a total of nine angles
centered symmetrically at θ̂k with 1◦ separations. To further
capture the environment information for adaptive interference
suppression, we use R and the presumed SVs {aφ } to specify
parameters {cφ }, {γk }. Precisely, for each Φk , cφ is set as
cφ = σ̂φ−1 / maxφ∈Φk {σ̂φ−1 }, where σ̂φ2 is the estimation of the
−1
so-called Capon spectrum [11], defined as σ̂φ2 = 1/aH
aφ .
φR
For {γP
k }, we specify them as γk = βk / maxk0 {βk0 }, where
βk = φ∈Φk σ̂φ2 .
In Figs. 1 and 2, the output SINRs of the P-ICMV beamformer are compared with other four beamformers. Parameter
µ and δ of the P-ICMV beamformer are set as µ = 10λmax (R)
and δ = 10−2 respectively, while the parameter ρ in the
ADMM algorithm is ρ = 10µ. Fig. 1 plots the output SINRs
under different SNR condition with 40 snapshots. It can
be observed that the P-ICMV beamformer achieves a stable

9

SNR: 15dB

30

Output SINR [dB]

output SINR and there is about 3dB performance degradation
from the optimal SINR among all SNR conditions. However,
the other beamformers suffer more performance degradation
as SNR increases. Notice the other four beamformers focus
on developing robustness against the desired signal’s SV
mismatch, they perform a little better than the P-ICMV beamformer in low SNR conditions where the estimation error of R
is small. In Fig. 2, the output SINRs under different number of
snapshots are compared while the input SNR is fixed at 15dB.
The P-ICMV beamformer does not show obvious performance
degradation as the number of snapshots decreases while the
other beamformers do.

In this subsection, we consider a hearing aids application
for speech enhancement with microphone array in a babble
noise environment. Similar to the evaluation in [1], [2], two
minimum variance-based beamformers: the LCMV and ICMV
beamformers are selected for comparison. A rectangular room
of size 12.7m×10m with height 3.6m is used for simulating
the acoustic environment and the reverberation time is set to be
0.6 second. The room impulse responses (RIRs) is generated
by the so-called image method [39]. We specify the hearing
aids wearer located at the center of the room, each hearing aid
has 2 microphones with 7.5mm spacing. The front microphone
of the left is set as the reference microphone. The head shadow
effect of the listener is also taken into account through using
the measurement of the head-related relative transfer functions
of the hearings aids on a mannequin. The simulated acoustic
environment is illustrated in Fig. 4.

The impact of the two trade-off parameters µ and δ are
studied in Fig. 3. As δ increases, the output SINR slightly
increases due to the true spatial response for the target signal
direction is bounded with more allowable SV mismatch.
However, as δ continues to increase, more DoFs are utilized
to guarantee the bounded true spatial responses, and hence the
output SINRs deteriorate.

Fig. 4: Simulated acoustic environment.
In the room, there are one target source and four interference
sources. The target and interference sources are represented by
speakers 1m away from the listener. The target is at 0◦ and
interferences are at ±70◦ and ±150◦ (corresponds to No. 1

10

to 4 in Fig. 4). The background babble noise is simulated
using 24 speakers at different locations. All speakers and
hearings aids microphones are in the same horizontal plane
at a height of 1.2m. All speakers’ speech signals are taken
from the TIMIT database [40]. For each speaker, there is 0.5
second silence between each sentence and the speech lasts
25 seconds. In the beginning 3 seconds, only those babble
speakers are active and such time segment is utilized for
estimating the noise correlation matrix R by sample averaging.
The input signal-to-noise (SNR) at the reference microphone
is set at 10dB and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for each
interference is set at −3dB. The audio signals are sampled
at 16kHz and a 1024-point FFT with 50% overlap is used
to transform the signals into the time-frequency domain. In
the simulation, anechoic ATFs and DoAs of each sources are
assumed known.
Since there are in total 5 sources but only 4 microphones,
the LCMV and ICMV beamformers can only have constraints
on 3 interferences besides the target. We use “Setup i,
i = 1, 2, 3, 4” to denote the setting in which interferer i is
ignored and other remaining interferences are suppressed with
the corresponding constraints. Specifically, define index set
Ti = {1, 2, 3, 4}/i, the LCMV beamformer formulation with
setup i is

I. In all 4 setups, the P-ICMV beamformer achieves more
interference and noise suppression than the LCMV and ICMV
beamformers in terms of the IW-SINRI metric. Also all three
beamformers have similar speech distortion in terms of IWSD scores. It can be observed that for the LCMV and ICMV
beamformers in setups 1 and 4 when one front interference
is ignored, the beamformer achieves reasonable interference
suppression. However, in setups 2 and 3 when one interference
in the rear one is ignored, the beamformer has a poor IWSINRI. This can be explained from the individual interference
suppression levels (ISL) and the corresponding snapshots of
the beam patterns. Fig. 5 plots the ISL for the 4 setups. The
ISL is defined as

We can see that the P-ICMV beamformers achieves around
10dB ISL for all interferences, while for the LCMV and

beamformer has low gain in the spatial responses at all 4
interferences’ direction. For LCMV and ICMV beamformers,
the ignored interference direction (±70◦ ) has reasonable gain
control due to the target constraint, but in setups 2 and 3, the
ignored interference direction (±150◦ ) remains high spatial responses which are even larger than 0dB. In short, when the Dof
is limited, the P-ICMV beamformer can automatically handle
the target source and all 4 interferences by intelligently allocating the DoF, while the LCMV and ICMV beamformers face a

At last, the performance of the P-ICMV beamformer with
different values of µ and δ (with the other one been fixed) are
studied in Figs. 9 and 10. To clearly understand the impact of
these two parameters, we separately plot IW-SIRI (signal to
interference ratio improvement), IW-SNRI (signal to noise ratio improvement), and IW-SD. In Fig. 9 (δ = 0.01), increasing
µ gives more priority to interferences suppression. Hence we
observe IW-SIRI improves, while IW-SNRI decreases. For a
fixed µ = λmax (R) with different δ (Fig. 10), we can observe
that increasing δ can reduce IW-SD, since spatial response for
the target signal are always bounded by the level cθ with more
allowable SV mismatch. On the other hand, allocating more
DoF to handle SV mismatch would sacrifice the interference
and noise suppression performance and hence we observe large
IW-SIRI and IW-SNRI decreases as δ increases.

C. Beam Pattern Synthesis
We consider a 30 × 30 planar antenna array with half wave
length spacing. A specified beam pattern with a large region
of low side lobes is to be synthesized. Specifically, we use
ϑ ∈ [0◦ , 180◦ ] and ψ ∈ [−90◦ , 90◦ ] to denote the azimuth and
elevation angles. The main lobe of the specified beam pattern
is pointed at θ0 = (ϑ0 , ψ0 ) = (90◦ , 15◦ ), and the side lobes
(SL) within region Φ = {(ϑ, ψ)|0◦ ≤ ϑ ≤ 180◦ , −90◦ ≤ ψ ≤
−10◦ } are expected to be as low as possible. Such kind of
beam pattern is desired in the ground-based radar applications
where clutters from low elevation angles are expected to
be suppressed as much as possible. To achieve such design
requirement, we specify the P-ICMV formulation as follows,
min kwk2 + µ max{φ }

w,{φ }

φ∈Φ

H

(32a)

H

(32b)

s.t. |w aθ − 1| + δkwk ≤ cθ , ∀θ ∈ Θ,
|w aφ | + δkwk ≤ φ cφ , ∀φ ∈ Φ,

where Θ = {(ϑ, ψ)|ϑ0 − 1◦ ≤ ϑ ≤ ϑ0 + 1◦ , ψ0 − 1◦ ≤ ψ ≤
ψ0 + 1◦ } and angle sets Θ and Φ are sampled every 1◦ for
both azimuth and elevation angles.
In the simulation, parameter cθ is specified as cθ =
0.3 × (dϑ − ϑ0 e + dψ − ψ0 e + 1), θ = (ϑ, ψ) ∈ Θ, where
d·e denotes the operation for counting angles difference by
unit degree, i.e., d±1◦ e = 1. The sufficient condition in
Proposition 3 gives the bound δ ≤ 1.15. The value of cφ
is fixed the same for all φ = (ϑ, ψ) ∈ Φ as 0.1. To study
the impact of parameters µ and δ, we fix µ = 10 and
evaluate the synthesized beam patterns with different choice of
δ (δ = 10−3 , 10−2 , 10−1 , 10−0.5 ). Notice that there are totally
14670 constraints for the specified P-ICMV formulation (32),
i.e., 3 × 3 = 9 constraints for Θ and 181 × 81 = 14661
constraints for Φ. Parameter ρ in ADMM algorithm is set
102 , and it only takes few tens of seconds for the ADMM
algorithm numerically converge.

SL (ASL) within region Φ with different δ are quite different.
Small δ allows more DoF for achieving smaller side lobes
but at the cost of increasing kwk. For large value of δ, more
DoF is allocated to counter the SV mismatch, and hence large
MSL and ASL are observed. Furthermore, in the presence
of SV mismatch, the levels of true SL are affected by SV
mismatch level. To evaluate the impact of δ on the levels
of true SL, we assume the SV perturbation consists of gain
and phase perturbations, which are randomly generated from
N (1, κ2 ) and N (0, (κπ/2)2 ) respectively and κ > 0 controls
the level of SV perturbation. The MSL and ASL with respect
to δ = 10−3 , 10−0.5 and different κ are compared in Fig.
12, where the MSL and ASL are calculated by averaging
100 independent simulation runs by randomly generating the
mismatched SVs. It can be observed that small δ gives lower
MSL and ASL when κ is small (κ = 10−4 ). As κ increases,
large δ achieves lower MSL and ASL since it handles a larger
SV mismatch. By Proposition 2, we know constraints (32b)
imply that the true spatial response |wH āφ | ≤ φ cφ , ∀φ ∈ Φ
for all perturbation satisfy k∆aφ k ≤ δ. In the case of
k∆aφ k = δ 0 > δ, the true spatial response is actually bounded
by φ cφ and kwk,
|wH āφ | ≤ |wH aφ | + δ 0 kwk ≤ φ cφ + (δ 0 − δ)kwk.
Hence, we observe that a large δ (which has a smaller kwk)
achieves a smaller MSL/ASL when κ is large (corresponds to
large δ 0 ).

Robust beamformer design always tries to seek a balance
among robustness and beamforming performance, where the
central issue lies in how to strike an appropriate balance automatically with limited array DoF. In this paper, we propose a

13

design of robust beamformer based on convex optimization to
address this issue, where a penalization criterion is utilized for
intelligently allocate the limited DoF. The proposed P-ICMV
formulation makes use of two types of inequality constraints to
introduce robustness against various uncertainties and a minmax penalization criterion for handling an arbitrary number
of interferences without DoF limitation. Several user-specified
parameters are also used in the formulation, which provide a
flexible mechanism to achieve different levels of robustness.
In addition, a low-complexity iterative algorithm is designed,
which can compute the P-ICMV beamformer efficiently even
for a large-size array. The P-ICMV beamformer can provide
an effective robust solution for challenging applications where
DoF is limited and model parameters are inaccurate. The
ability to achieve different robustness levels is demonstrated
in the simulations.

This completes the first part of the proof.
Now we prove the optimal y ∗ for problem (18) also has a
closed-form based on (37). Substitute (37) into problem (18)
and ignore some constant terms, problem (18) becomes

In the next, we replace conditions (34a) by (35) and study

(34d)). If λ > 0, then conditions (34b) and (34c) hold only

Notice max{c − r, δy} is a piecewise linear convex function

continuous and strongly convex. Then the optimal y ∗ for (38)
must satisfy ∂f (y ∗ ) = 0 or y ∗ = c/δ, where ∂f (y) is the

We first transform problem (20) into an equivalent form,
and then prove Lemma 2 by studying KKT conditions of the
transformed problem. Let the eigenvalue decomposition with
respect to A  0 as A = UΛUH , where U is a unitary
matrix stacked by eigenvectors and Λ is a diagonal matrix with
diagonal elements corresponding to eigenvalues λi > 0, i =
1, 2, . . . , M . Since for any w ∈ CM , kUH wk = kwk always

where b̄ = Ub. If (w̄∗ , y ∗ ) is optimal for problem (42),
then (UH w̄∗ , y ∗ ) is optimal for problem (20). The Lagrangian
function for problem (42) is
L(w̄, y, λ) = w̄H Λw̄ + Re{b̄H w̄} + αy 2 + βy + λ(kw̄k − y),
where λ ≥ 0 is the Lagrangian multiplier associated with the

w̄ = 0. To study the case for w̄∗ 6= 0, we consider β < kb̄k,

The unique y ∗ must lie in [ymin , ymax ], and can be obtained by
bisection search via (45).

Suppose (w̄∗ , y ∗ ) = (0, 0) is optimal for problem (42) and
β < kb̄k. Then, define a feasible solution (−b̄/kb̄k, ) with

Since β < kb̄k implies (−kb̄k + β) < 0. For sufficiently
