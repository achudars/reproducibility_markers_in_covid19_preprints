ABSTRACT
As progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), core collapse of massive stars and coalescence of compact object binaries are believed to be powerful sources of gravitational waves (GWs). In the collapsar
scenario, a rotating stellar-mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk might be running
in the center of a massive collapsar, which is one of the plausible central engines of long GRBs. Such
a BH hyperaccretion disk would be in a state of a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) at the
initial stage of the accretion process; meanwhile, the jets attempt to break out from the envelope and
circumstellar medium to power GRBs. In addition to collapsars, the BH hyperaccretion systems are
important sources of neutrinos and GWs. In this paper, we investigated the GW emission generated
by the anisotropic neutrino emission from NDAFs in the collapsar scenarios. As the results indicate,
the typical frequency of GWs is ∼ 1-100 Hz, and the masses and metallicities of the progenitor stars
have slight effects on the GW strains. The GWs from NDAFs might be detected by operational or
planned detectors at the distance of 10 kpc. Moreover, comparisons of the detectable GWs from collapsars, NDAFs, and GRB jets (internal shocks) are displayed. By combining the electromagnetic
counterparts, neutrinos, and GWs, one may constrain the characteristics of collapsars and central BH
accretion systems.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detection of gravitational waves (GWs)
from the binary black hole (BH) merger GW150914
marked that we entered an era of GW astronomy
(Abbott et al. 2016). The detection of GW event from
a binary neutron star (NS) merger system GW170817
(Abbott et al. 2016) that was associated with electromagnetic signals marked the beginning of multimessenger astronomy with GWs.
In the future,
astrophysical source including massive star collapse,
rapidly rotating NSs, and other violent events in the
Universe might be detected by GW detectors (e.g.,
Cutler & Thorne 2002). Especially for massive star colCorresponding author: Tong Liu

lapse, such an event is a promising multi-messenger transient source.
Observation evidences have indicated that core collapse massive stars are the progenitors of longduration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs, see the review
by Woosley & Bloom 2006; Kumar & Zhang 2015).
The majority of LGRB host galaxies are irregular,
star-forming galaxies (e.g., Fruchter et al. 2006). A
handful of LGRBs are associated with core collapse
supernovae (CCSNe, see, e.g., Galama et al. 1998;
Hjorth et al. 2003; Stanek et al. 2003; Malesani et al.
Note
2004; Modjaz et al. 2006; Pian et al. 2006).

line) events (e.g., Maurer et al. 2010; van Putten et al.

lined and bright type Ib/c SNe are accompanied
by LGRBs. In the collapsar model (e.g., Woosley
1993; MacFadyen & Woosley 1999; Woosley et al. 2002;

2

Wei & Liu

Zhang et al. 2004; Woosley & Heger 2012), the core of
the massive star will collapse; then a few M⊙ BH surrounded by a temporary disk with a very high accretion
rate might be formed. As a plausible central engine of
LGRBs, this accretion process can launch powerful jets.
If the activity of the central engine lasts long enough
to allow the jets to break out from the envelope and
circumstellar medium, an energetic LGRB will be triggered.
Generally, a BH hyperaccretion system can launch
GRB jets via two well-known mechanisms: the neutrinoantineutrino annihilation process and the BlandfordZnajek (BZ, Blandford & Znajek 1977) mechanism. If
the accretion rate is very high (∼ 0.001 − 10 M⊙ s−1 ),
then the photons are trapped in the disk, and generous neutrinos are produced. Neutrino pairs are emitted from the disk surface and annihilate above the
disk to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Such an accretion disk is called a neutrino-dominated accretion
flow (NDAF), whose properties have been widely investigated over the past decades (e.g., Popham et al.
1999; Narayan et al. 2001; Kohri & Mineshige 2002;
Lee et al. 2005; Gu et al. 2006; Chen & Beloborodov
2007; Janiuk et al. 2007; Kawanaka & Mineshige 2007;
Liu et al. 2007, 2015, 2017a; Lei et al. 2009; Xue et al.
2013; Song et al. 2016; Nagataki 2018). In the BZ mechanism, the magnetic lines tied on the disk will fall
into the BH, followed by the accretion materials; then,
Poynting jets would be launched via extraction of the
spin energy of the BH to power GRBs (e.g., Lee et al.
2000a,b; Mizuno et al. 2004; McKinney & Gammie
2004; Barkov & Komissarov 2008; Nagataki 2009;
Lei et al. 2013, 2017; Wu et al. 2013).
Nevertheless, for the very rapidly rotating BHs surrounded by the magnetized disks or toruses, the
temporal evolution of the accretion onto the BHs
may subject to the large-scale magnetic torques
(van Putten & Ostriker 2001). Thus the accretion mode
will be changed. The additional spin-up torque from
the BH may arrest the inflow for the duration of the
BH spin-down lifetime. Therefore, the activity duration of the central engine can derive from both the
timescale of accretion flow and the lifetime of the BH
spin, which are well-known also in the active galactic
nuclei community (O’Dea 2002). van Putten (2001) suggested that LGRBs arise with the rapidly spinning BHs
in the suspended accretion, while short GRBs arise with
the slowly spinning BHs.
Multimessenger observations are essential to constrain
the characteristics of collapsars, especially for the central BH accretion systems. It is difficult to extract
the information of the central engine from electromag-

netic signals, as the most observed electromagnetic signals from GRBs are produced in the regions far from
the central engines (Cutler & Thorne 2002). Neutrinos
and gravitational waves (GWs) can provide us with the
information hidden deep inside the stellar cores. The
detectable MeV neutrinos from NDAFs have been discussed in Liu et al. (2016). These neutrinos can reach a
luminosity of 1050 − 1051 erg s−1 , peaking at ∼ 10 MeV,
and might be observed by the next generation MeV neutrino detectors, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, when the
events are close enough to Earth. GW emission from
GRB central engines has been investigated in many previous works. Sun et al. (2012) studied the GWs from
jet precession driven by an NDAF around a spinning
BH. GWs generated by the anisotropic neutrino emission from NDAFs have been discussed in some studies
(e.g., Suwa & Murase 2009; Liu et al. 2017b). Liu et al.
(2017b) calculated the dependence of the GW strains
from NDAFs on both the BH spin and accretion rate.
They demonstrated that GWs from NDAFs might be
detected at a distance of ∼ 100 kpc/∼1Mpc by the
advanced LIGO/Einstein Telescope (ET) with a typical frequency of ∼10-100 Hz. They made a comparison of GWs from different central engines of GRBs:
NDAFs, BZ mechanisms (no GW emission), and millisecond magnetars. GWs from the central engines of
adjacent GRBs might be used to determine whether
there is an NDAF, BZ jets, or a magnetar. Furthermore, van Putten & Levinson (2003) studied the GWs
from a magnetized torus around a rapidly rotating
BH. They pointed out that the configuration of the
accretion torus itself might develop to the large nonaxisymmetries. The torus converts ∼ 10% BH spin
energy into the gravitational radiation through a finite number of the multipole mass moments and, to
less degree, into MeV neutrinos and winds. As demonstrated in van Putten et al. (2019a), they estimated total GW energy EGW ≃ (3.5 ± 1)%M⊙ c2 from BH spindown after post-merger in GW170817. GWs from the
suspended accretion are expected to be detected by
LIGO-Virgo up to the distances of about 100 Mpc (e.g.,
van Putten et al. 2019b).
This paper is the second work in a series on the BH hyperaccretion in collapsars. In Wei et al. (2019, hereafter
Paper I), we investigated the MeV neutrino emission
from NDAFs in the collapsar scenarios. In the initial
hundreds of seconds of the accretion process, the mass
supply rate of the massive progenitor is generally higher
than the ignition rate of NDAFs, but the jets are generally choked in the envelope. Thus, only neutrinos can be
emitted from the center of a collapsar. We studied the
effects of the masses and metallicities of the progenitor

Gravitational waves from hyperaccretion in collapsars
stars on the time-integrated spectra of electron neutrinos from NDAFs. The masses of collapsars have little
influence on the neutrino spectrum, and the low metallicities are beneficial for the production of low-energy
(. 1 MeV) neutrinos. We also studied the differences
in the electron neutrino spectra between NDAFs and
proto-NSs (PNSs), which may help one verify the possible remnants of the core collapse of massive stars with
future neutrino detectors.
In this paper, we focus on the GW emission from
NDAFs in the collapsar scenarios and study the effects
of the masses and metallicities of the progenitor stars
on the GW emission from NDAFs. Meanwhile, a comparison of GW signals from NDAFs, jets, and collapsars
is displayed. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the progenitor model and show the
method to calculate the GWs emitted by anisotropic
neutrino emission. Based on the time evolution of the
mass accretion of progenitors with different masses and
metallicities, the GW emission of NDAFs in the collapsars scenarios is studied. In addition, the detection
of GW signals is discussed. In section 3, we compare
the GW emission from different phases of collapsars. A
summary is presented in section 4.
2. GWS FROM NDAFS IN COLLAPSARS

2.1. Progenitor model
We adopt the pre-supernova (pre-SN) model (see,
e.g., Woosley et al. 2002; Woosley & Heger 2007;
Heger & Woosley 2010) in this work. After a massive
star collapses, a rotating stellar-mass BH surrounded
by a hyperaccretion disk might form. Using the density profiles of the pre-SN model (for details, see Paper
I), we can calculate the mass supply rate of the progenitors (see, e.g., Suwa & Ioka 2011; Woosley & Heger
2012; Matsumoto et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2018, 2019), i.e.,
Ṁpro =

dMr
dMr /dr
ρ
2Mr
=

dtff
dtff /dt
tff ρ̄ − ρ

(1)

where Mr is the mass coordinate, ρ is the mass density
of the progenitor star, and ρ̄ = 3Mr /(4πr3 ) is the mean
density within r. Here, we roughly set the accretion rate
Ṁ equal to the mass supply rate (e.g., Kashiyama et al.
2013; Nakauchi et al. 2013). The accretion timescale of
each mass shell at radius r is roughly equal to the freefall timescale:

2 2GMr
In the collapsar scenarios, the duration of the central engine can be related to the fallback accretion of

3

a progenitor envelope. For the suspended accretion
(van Putten & Ostriker 2001), the activity duration of
the central engine is expected to depend on the lifetime of the BH spin. Such case is not considered in
this work. In the initial hundreds of seconds of the
accretion process, the jets are generally choked in the
envelope of a collapsar, so no electromagnetic counterparts of the central engine can be observed (see, e.g.,
Kashiyama et al. 2013; Nakauchi et al. 2013; Liu et al.
2018, 2019; Song & Liu 2019). Whether the jets can
breakout out depends on the activity timescale of the
central engine, the scale and density of the dense circumstellar medium (CSM) and the properties of the jets. If
the activity of the central engine lasts long enough to
allow the jets to break out of the envelope and CSM, an
energetic LGRB will be triggered (e.g., Liu et al. 2018,
2019).
2.2. GWs from NDAFs
For NDAFs, there are some characteristic radii (e.g.,
Chen & Beloborodov 2007; Zalamea & Beloborodov
2011; Liu et al. 2017a, 2018; Zhang 2018), such as the
ignition radius rign , which can be defined as the radius
−
such that Q−
ν /Qvis = 1/2, where Qν and Qvis are the
neutrino cooling rate and the viscous heating rate, respectively (e.g., Chen & Beloborodov 2007; Liu et al.
2017a). Inside the region of . rign , one can say that
neutrino cooling processes are dominant. Therefore,
an NDAF is ignited only when rign is larger than the
inner radius of the disk. The corresponding mass accretion rate is Ṁign , which is mainly related to the
BH spin and the viscous parameter of the disk. If
Ṁ < Ṁign ∼ 0.001 M⊙ s−1 , the neutrino emission can
be ignored, and the disk is no longer called an NDAF.
In the collapsar scenarios, the mass accretion onto the
BH decreases over time, and the typical duration of the
NDAF in the collapsar is hundreds of seconds.
Xue et al. (2013) investigated one-dimensional global
solutions of NDAFs in the Kerr metric, taking into account the detailed neutrino physics, chemical potential equilibrium, neutrino trapping and nucleosynthesis.
They calculated 16 solutions with different characterized accretion rates and BH spins. Based on the results,
they fitted time-independent analytical formulas, and
the neutrino luminosity Lν is given by
log Lν (erg s−1 ) ≈ 52.5 + 1.17a∗ + 1.17 log ṁ,

(3)

where a∗ (0 < a∗ < 1) is the mean dimensionless BH
spin parameter, and ṁ = Ṁ /M⊙ s−1 is the dimensionless accretion rate. We adopt a∗ = 0.9 in our calculations.
According to the above formulas, we can roughly obtain the time evolution of the neutrino luminosity Lν (t).

respectively.

The GW emission from NDAFs depends on the neutrino
luminosity, and the typical GW frequency is related to
the variabilities and duration of neutrino emission.
The GWs from anisotropic neutrino radiation were
first analyzed by Epstein (1978). We adopt the methods applied to CCSNe (e.g., Burrows & Hayes 1996;
Müller & Janka 1997; Kotake et al. 2006, 2007) to calculate the GWs from NDAFs in the collapsar scenarios.
With the angles θ′ and φ′ defining the radiation direction in the source coordinate frame, the GW amplitude
is given by (e.g., Müller & Janka 1997; Suwa & Murase
2009)
h+ (t, ϑ) =

where ϑ is the viewing angle, R is the distance from the
observer to the source, dLν /dΩ′ represents the directiondependent neutrino luminosity per unit of solid angle in
the direction of Ω′ , and Ψ(θ′ , φ′ , ϑ) denotes the angle

dependent factor,
Ψ(θ′ , φ′ , ϑ) = (1 + cosθ′ cosϑ + sinθ′ cosφ′ sinϑ)
×

(sinθ′ cosφ′ cosϑ − cosθ′ sinϑ)2 − sin2 θ′ sin2 φ′
. (5)
(sinθ′ cosφ′ cosϑ − cosθ′ sinϑ)2 + sin2 θ′ sin2 φ′

When dLν /dΩ′ is axisymmetric, the counterpart
of the amplitude, hT×T , vanishes (for details, see
Suwa & Murase 2009). In this work, we suppose the
NDAF as a geometrically infinitely thin disk and assume that the emission of neutrinos is isotropic at any
point of the disk surface. The neutrino luminosity per
solid angle can be written as dLν /dθ′ = Lν |cosθ′ | /2π.
Then, Equation (4) is integrated analytically as

Here, we can see the dependence of the GW amplitude
on the viewing angle ϑ. For ϑ = π/2, the observer is

located in the equatorial plane of the disk, and the GW
amplitude is the largest.
The local energy flux of GWs is given by (e.g.,

2.3. Results
We selected progenitor metallicities of Z/Z⊙ =1, 0.1,
0.01, and 10−4 and masses of Mpro /M⊙ =20, 30, 40, and
60, where Z⊙ is the metallicity of the Sun, to investigate
the effects of the mass and metallicity on the GW emission of NDAFs. Based on the density profiles of the progenitor stars with different masses and metallicities (for
details, see Paper I), we can calculate the time evolution
of the mass accretion rate of progenitor stars, as shown

5

in Figure 1. The blue, red, green, and black curves correspond to progenitor masses of Mpro /M⊙ =20, 30, 40,
and 60, respectively. The different density profiles of the
progenitor stars cause the difference in Ṁ . In the initial
accretion stage, the mass accretion rates are all approximately 1 M⊙ s−1 , which are typical mass accretion rates
of NDAFs. The metallicities can affect the duration of
the neutrino emission in collapsars, while the progenitor
mass plays an important role in the time evolution of
the mass accretion rate.
Figure 2 shows the strains of the GWs from NDAFs
in the center of collapsars at the distance of 10 kpc.
The blue, red, green, and black curves correspond to
the progenitor masses of Mpro /M⊙ =20, 30, 40, and 60,
respectively. Sensitivity lines (the noise amplitudes hn )
of aLIGO, ET, LISA, DECIGO/BBO, and ultimateDECIGO are shown in these figures. As the progenitor mass increases, the mass accretion rate onto the BH
tends to slightly rise in the initial accretion phase, as
shown in Figure 1, so the GW strains increase within an
order of magnitude. Meanwhile, the progenitor metallicities also have little influence on the GW strains, as
the accretion rates in the initial accretion stage show little difference for the different metallicities and the same
mass. Although the lower metallicities correspond to a
longer duration of neutrino emission, the neutrino cooling is invalid in the late accretion stage. Overall, the
GW signals from NDAFs in the center of the massive
progenitor stars are more likely to be detected at the
distance of 10 kpc.
The effects of the distance on the detection of GW signals from NDAFs are clearly displayed in Figure 3. At a
distance of ∼ 10 kpc, the GWs from NDAFs in the center of the very massive progenitors might be detected by
DECIGO/BBO and ultimate-DECIGO and by ET and
aLIGO in the detectable frequency range of ∼ 10-100 Hz.
Even so, it is difficult to distinguish the characteristics of
the progenitor stars from the GW detection, as shown in
Figure 2. Multimessenger observations, including electromagnetic and neutrino emissions, are indispensable
for constraining the nature of the progenitor stars, as
well as that of the central BH hyperaccretion systems.
Moreover, one can see that the GW signals of NDAFs
at the distance of 1 Mpc are almost impossible to detect
by the operational or planned detectors.
Note that the star rotation was neglected in the above
pre-SN model. For the moderately rotating stars, the
rotation has limited effects on the neutrino emission
from NDAFs. However, as shown in Janiuk & Proga
(2008), the various rotation profiles imposed on the collapsing stars may significantly change the evolution of
GRBs. Thus, for fast-rotating progenitor stars, the ro-

NDAFs.
3. GW EMISSION IN MASSIVE COLLAPSARS

GW emission from collapsars has been investigated
for approximately four decades. Numerous numerical
simulations predicted that GWs from various phenomena associated with gravitational collapse could be detected by ground-based and space-based interferometric
GW detectors (see the review by Fryer & New 2011).
For most of the massive stars, the GW signals from
core collapsars will be similar to those from normal
CCSNe, whose GW signals have been widely investigated (see the review by Ott 2009; Kotake 2013).
If the core collapsars and/or the resulting supernova
(SN) explosions are nonspherical such that the third
time derivative of the quadrupole moment of the massenergy distribution is nonzero, part of the liberated
gravitational binding energy will be emitted in the
form of GWs. Such nonsphericities can be caused
by the effects of rotation, convection and anisotropic

neutrino emission. These effects lead either to smallscale statistical mass-energy fluctuations or large-scale
asphericities (e.g., Müller 1982; Moenchmeyer et al.
Yamada & Sato
1995;
Zwerger & Müller
1991;
1997; Rampp et al. 1998; Dimmelmeier et al. 2002;

Epstein 1978; Burrows & Hayes 1996; Müller & Janka
1997; Müller et al. 2004). In the collapsar scenarios, a
massive star will go through the collapse, bounce, and
postbounce phase, then BH formation, the hyperaccretion phase, and the GRB jet phase (e.g., Kotake et al.
2012; Ott et al. 2011). From the perspective of detecting GWs, we divide this evolutionary process into three
periods: the collapsar phase (from collapse and bounce
to BH formation), central engine phase (hyperaccretion phase) and GRB jet phase. We study the typical
frequencies and amplitudes of GW signals from these
three different phases and plot the results in Figure
4. The blue, purple, and orange shaded regions represent the collapsar phase, NDAFs and GRB jet phase,
respectively. The detection distance is 10 kpc. The

characteristic amplitude of GWs from the suspend accretion is not include is Figure 4. The GWs from the
non-axisymmetric accretion flow around a rapidly rotating BH are expected to detected up to distance of about
100 Mpc (van Putten et al. 2019b). At the distance of
10 kpc, the characteristic amplitude of the GWs from
the suspend accretion is much larger than that from
NDAFs.
In the collapsar phase, the primary GW signals are
unlikely to be different from normal CCSNe. Most of
the original studies paid attention to the strong GW signals produced at the rotating collapse and core bounce
phase due to the large-scale aspherical motion of matter. The peak amplitude is roughly proportional to the
collapsar spin. The typical frequency is expected to be
100-1000 Hz (see, e.g., Kotake et al. 2006; Kotake 2013;
Ott 2009).
In the postbounce phase, the anisotropic matter
motions associated with the convection, anisotropic
neutrino radiation, and standing-accretion-shock instability (SASI, e.g., Scheck et al. 2008; Burrows et al.
2006; Foglizzo et al. 2007; Blondin et al. 2003;
Blondin & Mezzacappa 2006; Kotake et al. 2007) are
expected to be the primary sources for GWs. Convective instability is an important feature of the postbounce evolution of massive stars (see, e.g., Janka et al.
2007; Buras et al. 2006; Burrows et al. 2006, 2007;
Janka & Müller 1996). The convective overturn is
expected as the entropy- and lepton-gradient-driven
prompt convection that may occur immediately after bounce, lepton-gradient driven PNS convection,
and neutrino-driven convection in the post-shock heating region (e.g., Ott et al. 2008; Fryer & Heger 2000;

7

Burrows & Lattimer 1983). The SASI caused by either
an advective acoustic or a purely acoustic feedback cycle
would lead to the growth of perturbations in the stalled
shock (e.g., Scheck et al. 2008; Foglizzo et al. 2007;
Blondin et al. 2003; Blondin & Mezzacappa 2006).
When the SASI enters a nonlinear phase, it would
heavily distort the post-shock region and affect convection. Both the convection and SASI would lead to
time-varying mass-quadrupole moments giving rise to a
long-duration stage of large amplitude GW emission. A
semiquantitative summary of the GW emission by the
aspherical fluid motions associated with the convection
and SASI is given by Ott (2009). Based on numerous
previous simulations (e.g., Ott et al. 2006; Müller et al.
2004; Marek et al. 2009), they provided estimations for
the typical GW strains at 10 kpc, with the typical emission frequency f approximately in the range of 100-1000
Hz.
For core collapse of massive stars, anisotropic neutrino emission may arise (a) from the global asymmetries in the (precollapse) matter distribution (see,
e.g., Burrows & Hayes 1996; Fryer et al. 2004a), (b)
from the convective overturn and SASI (see, e.g.,
Ott et al. 2006; Kotake et al. 2007; Marek et al. 2009),
and (c) from the rotationally deformed PNSs (e.g.,
Kotake et al. 2006; Müller et al. 2004). In contrast to
the rapidly varying GW waveforms from matter motion, the GW waveforms from the anisotropic neutrino emission show a long-timescale variability. Hence,
the anisotropic neutrino emission dominates the GW
spectrum at low frequencies (below ∼ 100 Hz) (e.g.,
Burrows & Hayes 1996; Müller et al. 2004; Kotake et al.
2006). In addition, the precollapse density inhomogeneities (e.g., Burrows & Hayes 1996; Müller & Janka
1997; Fryer 2004), nonaxisymmetric rotational instabilities (e.g., Rampp et al. 1998; Ott et al. 2007), g-mode
(e.g., Ott et al. 2006) and r-mode pulsations of PNSs
(e.g., Andersson et al. 2011), and aspherical mass ejection may contribute to the overall GW signature.
In the later BH formation phase, the typical frequency of GW signals is relatively high (e.g., Pan et al.
2018). GW emission at BH formation in the collapsar scenario has been studied by some previous
works (e.g., Sekiguchi & Shibata 2005; Ott et al. 2011;
Cerdá-Durán et al. 2013; Pan et al. 2018). These works
showed that the peak frequency from g-mode PNS oscillations at BH formation is expected to be above 2 kHz.
However, such GW signals are very close to the limit
of the current GW detectors and are difficult to detect.
Overall, according to the GW emission mechanisms and
current GW detectors, the most promising detectable
frequency is at 100-1000 Hz in the collapsar phase. For

As shown in Figure 4, the GW signals from collapsars
are likely to be detected by aLIGO and ET.
In the central engine phase (hyperaccretion phase),
GWs are expected to be from the BH-inner-disk precession system (e.g., Sun et al. 2012) and the anisotropic
neutrino emission from NDAFs (e.g., Suwa & Murase
2009; Liu et al. 2017a). In Sun et al. (2012), they studied the GWs of the jet precession based on NDAFs
around spinning BHs. They argued that disk-driven
jet precession may be common in a BH accretion system since the only necessary condition is that the angular momentum of the initial accretion flow is misaligned with the BH spinning axis. The GW signals
from such systems are expected to be detectable at the
frequency of tens of Hz and have comparable amplitudes
to GW signals from the anisotropic neutrino emission.
For GWs from the anisotropic neutrino emission, the
detectable frequency is at 1-100 Hz, as shown in Figure 2. As discussed in section 2.3, the progenitor mass
and metallicity have little influence on GW signals. The
maximum amplitude of GWs from NDAFs is roughly
hmax = 5 × 10−22 .
In the GRB jet phase, the relativistic jets are expected to be GW sources and have been studied by
some previous works (see, e.g., Segalis & Ori 2001;

Sago et al. 2004; Birnholtz & Piran 2013; Akiba et al.
2013). Sago et al. (2004) analyzed the GWs from the
accelerating phase of GRB jets based on the internal
shock model. The ultrarelativistic nonspherically symmetrical acceleration of energetic jets is expected to emit
GWs. For such GW signals, the maximum amplitude is
∼ 10−22 at the frequency of ∼ 0.1 Hz at 10 kpc. Meanwhile, GW emission is also expected to be produced in
the decelerating phase of GRB jets (e.g., Akiba et al.
2013). The GW amplitude is approximately ∼ 10−24
Hz at the frequency of 10-100 Hz, which is too low to
be detected. Therefore, in such a phase, the GW signals are more likely to be detected at 0.1-10 Hz by DECIGO/BBO and ultimate-DECIGO.
As the above discussion indicates, the GW signals related to the various mechanisms from the three phases
have different characteristic frequencies. The collapsar
phase occurs earlier than the central engine phase and
GRB jet phase. From the perspective of detection, one
would receive the high-frequency GW signals from collapsars first and then the low-frequency GW signals from
later phases.
4. SUMMARY

In this work, we employed the pre-SN model and studied the GWs generated by the anisotropic neutrino emission from NDAFs in the center of collapsars. We found
that the progenitor mass and metallicity have little influence on the GW emission. The GW signals from NDAFs
in the center of the massive progenitor stars are more
likely to be detected by GW detectors at the distance
of 10 kpc. Then, we briefly summarized the GW emission in the different phases of collapsars. The primary
detectable frequencies and strains in the three phases
(the collapsar, central engine, and GRB jet phases) are
different. Considering that the three phases occur in a
time sequence, one may distinguish the detectable GWs
from the different phases, which can partly verify the
collapsar model and BH hyperaccretion solution.
Furthermore, it is inadequate to constrain the nature
of the progenitors solely according to the GW detection. By combining the electromagnetic counterparts,
neutrinos, and GWs, we might obtain the accurate and
authentic properties of the progenitor stars and central
BH accretion systems. In Song & Liu (2019), they constrained the characteristics of the progenitor stars of the
GRB-SN case by LGRB-SN data. In Paper I, we have
investigated the effects of the mass and metallicity of
progenitor stars on the time-integrated spectrum of electron neutrinos from NDAFs. The detection of sub-MeV
neutrinos may help us limit the metallicities of the progenitor stars.
