Abstract
Metal-mediated exfoliation has been demonstrated as a promising approach for obtaining largearea flakes of 2D materials to fabricate prototypical nanoelectronics. However, several
processing challenges related to organic contamination at the interfaces of the 2D material and
the gate oxide must be overcome to realize robust devices with high yield. Here, we demonstrate
an optimized process to realize high-performance field-effect transistor (FET) arrays from largearea (» 5000 μm2) monolayer MoS2 with a yield of 85 %. A central element of this process is an
exposed material forming gas anneal (EM-FGA) that results in uniform FET performance
metrics (i.e., field-effect mobilities, threshold voltages, and contact performance).
Complementary analytical measurements show that the EM-FGA process reduces deleterious
channel doping effects by decreasing organic contamination, while also reducing the prevalence
of insulating molybdenum oxide, effectively improving the MoS2-gate oxide interface. The
uniform FET performance metrics and high device yield achieved by applying the EM-FGA
technique on large-area 2D material flakes will help advance the fabrication of complex 2D
nanoelectronics devices and demonstrates the need for improved engineering of the 2D materialgate oxide interface.

1. Introduction
With the scaling of silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) field-effect
transistor (FET) technology approaching fundamental limits of device dimensions, power
consumption, and heat dissipation,1-2 an intense effort is underway to develop the next generation
of switching devices for use in efficient computation and other low power applications.3-5 Over
the last decade, progress in the use of two-dimensional (2D) materials for numerous applications
in the field of nanoelectronics has demonstrated the potential for these materials to transform the
semiconductor industry.6-8 Two-dimensional materials have diverse electronic properties,
ranging from semi-metals (e.g., graphene) to semiconductors (e.g., MoS2, WSe2, etc.) to
insulators (e.g., hexagonal boron nitride).9-12 Furthermore, even when these materials are made
atomically thin (i.e., a single monolayer), they exhibit good electrical and mechanical
properties13-15 making them ideal candidates for next generation electronics. A broad range of
high-performance electronic devices such as FETs,16-17 light-emitting diodes (LED),11,

18

photodetectors,19-20 and biosesnors21-22 have been realized from 2D materials showcasing their
utility in applications where high sensitivity and low power operation are required. However,
while the diversity of electronic properties and devices that can be obtained by using 2D
materials is virtually limitless, their practical realization is hampered by device fabrication
challenges, such as contamination at the interface of the material and gate oxide,23-25 poor
channel doping control,26-29 and high contact resistance,26,

30-31

resulting in unreliable device

performance.
2D materials can be obtained from either geological sources or through chemical synthesis.
Mechanical exfoliation32 has been traditionally used to obtain 2D materials from geological
sources, allowing the fabrication of prototype devices that demonstrate their remarkable
properties. However, it is difficult to obtain 2D material flakes with areas large enough to
2

fabricate arrays of nanoelectronics devices or logic circuits using this technique. To overcome
this challenge, methods including chemical vapor deposition (CVD)33-35 and physical vapor
deposition (PVD)36 are being developed to synthesize 2D material flakes with sufficiently large
areas. Despite rapid progress in recent years, the performance of devices fabricated from 2D
materials generated with these deposition methods have lagged behind the performance of those
fabricated from geologically sourced 2D materials.34,

37-41

In the interim, metal-mediated

exfoliation techniques that yield millimeter scale 2D materials42-44 can permit the realization of
large arrays of devices and complex logic circuits. However, 2D material flakes obtained through
metal-mediated exfoliation can suffer from both organic and metal contamination originating
from multiple adhesive transfer steps, which can degrade device performance through
uncontrolled channel doping and charge traps at the 2D material-gate oxide interfaces, making
the fabrication of devices with these 2D material flakes difficult.42, 45-46 Therefore, new processes
informed by better characterization of the interface between a 2D material and the gate oxide are
needed to improve the performance and reliability of devices fabricated from metal-mediated
sourced 2D materials.
We demonstrate a process that improves the performance and reliability of FETs fabricated
from MoS2 monolayers obtained by gold-mediated exfoliation.42 To date, techniques such as
ultra-high vacuum (UHV) annealing47-49 and UV ozone (UV-O3)48,

50-52

have been applied to

multilayer MoS2 flakes obtained with traditional mechanical exfoliation to remove organic
contamination. However, their use with monolayers has thus far been avoided because of the risk
of destroying the material or generating insulating molybdenum oxide (MoOx). Similarly,
forming gas annealing (FGA) has been applied to MoS2 FETs to improve metal-MoS2 contact
resistance and also remove organic contamination,48, 53 but such anneals are usually performed at
temperatures between 200°C and 300°C, for short durations (2 – 4 hours), and after the

3

deposition of a top-gate oxide to minimize the risk of material damage and mitigate the creation
of sulfur vacancies.53-54 Forming gas annealing for longer temperature and durations on exposed
MoS2 is thought to damage or destroy the material,54 but we demonstrate it does not.
The processing techniques developed as part of this work, namely an exposed material
forming gas anneal (EM-FGA), allow high performance FET arrays to be reliably fabricated
from MoS2 obtained from metal-mediated exfoliation. FET performance improvements are a
direct result of the EM-FGA improving the 2D material-gate oxide interfaces, which decreases
deleterious channel doping without damaging the material, and eliminates the presence of
insulating molybdenum oxide MoOx. We show the physical and chemical basis for improved
FET performance with complementary analytical measurements using Raman spectroscopy, Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the EM-FGA and its reliability for the fabrication of FETs and potentially other
devices fabricated from 2D materials.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1 Monolayer MoS2 Field-Effect Transistor Fabrication
To realize monolayer MoS2 FETs, MoS2 was first transferred onto an oxidized Si substrate
with an oxide (SiO2) thickness of 70 nm using the gold-mediated exfoliation technique described
in the Methods.42 Numerous flakes of the transferred material were measured using Raman
spectroscopy to have monolayer thickness with an average area between 1000 μm2 and 5000 μm2
as seen from Figure 1a. The Raman peaks corresponding to the E12g phonon mode (in-plane
vibration for Mo and S at ≈ 386 cm−1) and the A1g mode (out-of-plane vibration for Mo and S at
≈ 403 cm−1) were found to be in good agreement with the expected shift55 for monolayer MoS2
(thickness ≈ 0.7 nm) and yielded a frequency difference of 16.6 cm−1 (Figure 1b, orange).
4

Furthermore, the frequency difference between the A1g and E12g peaks increased to 22.4 cm−1 for
a bilayer and to 24.8 cm−1 for bulk MoS2 flakes (Figure S1) in agreement with literature values.55

contact). (d) Optical image of a representative array of FETs prior to deposition of the top-gate dielectric

A schematic of a monolayer MoS2 FET is depicted in Figure 1c (see Methods for fabrication
details). Briefly, the source (S) and drain (D) contacts (2 nm Ti/80 nm Au) were patterned by
using optical lithography and electron-beam metal deposition after gold-mediated transfer of
monolayers. For each FET, a 5 μm ´ 5 μm channel was lithographically defined and
5

subsequently etched. Figure 1d shows an optical image of an array of three FETs with a global
back-gate (BG) and back-gate dielectric (gray, SiO2). Next, the top-gate (TG) dielectric (blue,
Al2O3) was deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and the top-gate metal (10 nm Ti/100
nm Au) was patterned using optical lithography and electron-beam metal deposition. The large
areas and relative abundance of exfoliated monolayers on the substrate allowed for batch
fabrication of numerous monolayer FET arrays on a 4-inch wafer.

steps (on the left) highlight the newly developed exposed material forming gas anneal (EM-FGA)
sequence while the green steps (on the right) represent a conventional sequence for FET fabrication from
2D materials. The blue steps (top and bottom) are common to both processes.

2.2 Forming Gas Anneal Effects on FET Performance
Two sets of FETs were fabricated by using the process flow described in section 2.1 and
shown in Figure 2. A control set (n=5) was processed using the steps shown in Figure 2 on the
right in green, in which a conventional annealing process was used, i.e. the entire set of five
control FETs underwent a forming gas anneal (FGA) immediately after deposition of a top-gate
oxide.48,

54

The second set of FETs (n=20) was fabricated with our new EM-FGA process as

illustrated in Figure 2 on the left in orange. We varied the anneal time and gas flow rate (Figure
S2) and determined that an anneal temperature of 400 °C with 100 cm3/min forming gas for 24
hours at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 0 °C and 101 kPa, respectively (100 sccm),
yielded an optimum improvement in performance. The back-gate performance of both the
control and EM-FGA FETs was characterized after deposition of the top-gate oxides, but without
the top-gate metals. Next, top-gate metals were deposited onto both sets of FETs followed by a
second shorter FGA (Figure 2). Finally, the top-gate performance of all devices was measured
while the back-gate was connected to ground.
Both the EM-FGA and control FETs demonstrated measurable improvement in back-gate
performance compared to as-exfoliated (before FGA or top-gate oxide deposition) back-gate
performance (Figure S3; blue). On average, 85 % (n=17/20) of EM-FGA FETs showed
consistent and improved performance relative to the control samples. Next, we discuss the
electrical characteristics of the EM-FGA FETs compared to the control set.
Back-gate Performance
EM-FGA FET back-gate performance after top-gate oxide deposition and prior to top-gate
metal deposition is shown by the representative orange transfer curve in Figure 3a for
VDS = 1.05 V (all transfer curves can be seen in Figure S4). The measurements were repeated for

8

multiple (stepped) VDS as seen in Figure 3b, where minimal hysteresis was observed. Average
electrical performance parameters for all the measured devices are reported in Table 1. All
devices demonstrated n-type behavior, consistent with previous observations for MoS2 FETs.16, 56
Unless otherwise noted, error bars reported in this work represent the standard error.
Table 1. Performance parameters for EM-FGA and control FETs reported as means and standard errors.
Several of these metrics are labeled as “N/A” because the large flat band shift in VT for the control FETs
precluded an accurate estimation of these metrics without inducing dielectric breakdown in the back-gate
or top-gate oxide.

On average, we observed an Ion/Ioff ratio of ≈ 105, and a subthreshold swing of

an Ion of at least 10 μA/μm and a field-effect mobility (μFE), not correcting for source and drain

and Cox is the oxide capacitance per unit area, determined to be 49.3 nF/cm2 for the 70 nm SiO2
back-gate dielectric.57 To prevent the risk of dielectric breakdown, we limited the range of VBG to
±25 V. The threshold voltage (VT), estimated by extrapolating the point of maximum slope on the

transfer curve to the x-axis, was found to be (2.4 ± 0.9) V for the EM-FGA FETs. In contrast, the
control set exhibited a large and negative shift in VT of (−21.1 ± 2.2) V, as shown by the
10

representative green transfer curve in Figure 3a (all transfer curves can be seen in Figure S5).
This shift in VT is the key improvement in performance for the EM-FGA FETs that separates
them from the control FETs.
Notably, a negative shift in VT of the control set is consistent with previous observations of
MoS2 FETs after top-gate oxide deposition.48, 58 This shift could be explained by the presence of
large trapped charges at the MoS2-top gate oxide interfaces that dopes the channel and induces a
flatband voltage (VFB) shift. To quantify this behavior, we define 𝑉"3 = 𝜑56 −

is the difference in the workfunction between the back-gate and the semiconducting MoS2, Qi is
the density of fixed oxide and channel-contaminating charges, and Cox is the back-gate oxide

and control FETs with respect to the ideal case by setting VG = VT, and assuming several other

assume Qi = 0 yielding ∆𝑉A(CDECFGHCIJKLMGNCKL) =

.

For a monolayer MoS2 FET, ideal VT is defined as the VG at which the quantum capacitance
of the channel equals Cox.60 This definition must be used instead of the standard definition of VT,
which is only applicable to bulk FETs.59 Using equations (1) – (3) outlined in Methods, the
theoretical value of VT was calculated to be +0.7 V for a FET for a monolayer MoS2 channel on a
70 nm SiO2 oxide. Therefore, the experimentally observed VT of (2.4 ± 0.9) V for the EM-FGA
case compares favorably to the theoretical value. On the other hand, for the control FETs, we

11

measured VT = (−21.1 ± 2.2) V, which represents a large and negative shift from ideal VT (Table
1), indicating the presence of substantial positive contamination that dopes the channel. The
preceding results allowed us to estimate Qi for both the EM-FGA and the control FETs. The
estimated value of Qi is closer to ideal for the EM-FGA FETs (≈ −4.5 × 1011 q/cm2) than for the
control FETs (≈ 6.7 × 1012 q/cm2). The order of magnitude reduction in charge, due to the
removal of positive contamination, strongly shifts VT of the EM-FGA FETs in the positive
direction and closer to the ideal value of +0.7 V. Furthermore, the estimated value of VT for the
EM-FGA devices is statistically consistent with the ideal value with 95 % confidence. This
highlights the importance of the sequence of processing steps developed in this study (see Figure
2) with respect to improving the quality of a 2D material-gate oxide interface.
The benefits of the EM-FGA also extend to improved contact performance in the EM-FGA
devices relative to the control set. After the EM-FGA, the IDS-VDS response of the FETs as a
function of VBG was found to be Ohmic as seen in Figure 3c (all EM-FGA FET IDS-VDS
responses can be seen in Figure S6 and 2-point resistances can be seen in Table S1). In contrast,
Figure 3d demonstrates that the control devices exhibited rectifying characteristics indicating the
presence of a Schottky barrier at those contacts (all control FET IDS-VDS responses can be seen in
Figure S7). We quantified the difference in contact resistance (RC) between the EM-FGA and
control FETs using a four-point probe measurement technique (Figure S8) as described in
Methods. From these measurements, RC was estimated to be (35 ± 3) kΩ-μm for the EM-FGA
FETs and (785 ± 32) kΩ-μm for the control FETs, where RC for the EM-FGA FETs is ten-fold
lower than previously reported for monolayer MoS2 FETs.63
Forming gas annealing improves contact resistance (RC) between metal source/drain contacts
and MoS2 through two mechanisms: 1) by removing organic contamination in the vicinity of the
metal contacts, which generates a physical barrier between the metal contacts49, 53-54 and 2) by
12

locally doping the MoS2 under the source and drain contacts with metal atoms.63-64 The EM-FGA
FETs demonstrate lower RC compared to the control FETs because the first mechanism is more
effective without a top-gate oxide acting as a physical barrier to the removal of organic
contamination by hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the second mechanism is more readily permitted in
the EM-FGA FETs because organic contamination does not serve as a physical barrier to the
doping of MoS2 under the metal contacts with metal atoms. In contrast, the control FETs were
annealed after the deposition of the top-gate dielectric, which shields the MoS2-contact metal
interface from hydrogen gas penetration, decreasing the effectiveness of organic contamination
removal and subsequent doping of MoS2 with metal atoms.
Many of the improvements displayed by the EM-FGA FETs were also observed for the
control FETs. For example, we observed minimal hysteresis, while the drive current was found
to be at least 10 μA/μm at large positive VBG and μFE was (13.5 ± 3.5) cm2/V·s prior to correcting
for the contact resistance (Table 1). However, the large shift in VT for the control FETs precluded
an accurate estimation of the Ion/Ioff ratio and the subthreshold swing without inducing dielectric
breakdown in the back-gate dielectric.
Top-gate Performance. One goal of our approach is to make top-gated monolayer MoS2 FETs
for switching or sensing applications. Therefore, after back-gate characterization, the top-gate
metal was deposited onto both the EM-FGA and control FETs followed by a second, shorter
FGA, to improve top-gate performance. EM-FGA FET top-gate performance is shown by the
representative orange transfer curve in Figure 4a and reported for all measured devices in
Table 1 (all transfer curves can be seen in Figure S9). On average, and similarly to the back-gate
results, we measured minimal hysteresis, an Ion/Ioff ratio of ≈ 106, and a subthreshold swing of
(650 ± 24) mV/dec. At large and positive VTG, we measured a drive current of at least 10 μA/μm
and μFE of (2.8 ± 0.5) cm2/V·s before correcting for the contact resistance (and assuming Cox to
13

be 398 nF/cm2 for the top-gate oxide). VT was found to be (−1.8 ± 0.3) V, estimated by
extrapolating the point of maximum slope on the transfer curve to the x-axis.
To compare our experimental top-gate VT of (−1.8 ± 0.3) V to the ideal value, we again used
equations (1) – (3) to calculate ideal VT for a top-gate FET with a monolayer MoS2 channel
under a 20 nm Al2O3 oxide. This value was found to be +0.8 V. In contrast to the back-gate
performance, the experimentally determined value of VT does not compare favorably to ideality,
indicating that the contaminants doping the channel affect top-gate performance more than backgate performance. This may be, in part, due to trapping of these fixed charges at the interface
degrading gate control. EM-FGA parameters will be further optimized in future work with the
aim of reducing Qi at the MoS2-top-gate oxide interface and to shift top-gate VT closer to ideality.

curves for an EM-FGA FET at varied VTG demonstrating improvement to contact resistance. (c)
Representative IDSVDS curves for a control FET at varied VTG. All measurements were made with
VBG = 0 V.

Finally, Figure 4b demonstrates that the device IDS-VDS characteristics were found to be
Ohmic for the EM-FGA FETs (all IDS-VDS curves can be seen in Figure S10 and 2-point
resistances can be seen in Table S1), in contrast to Figure 4c that demonstrates the rectifying
behavior observed for the control FETs (all IDS-VDS curves can be seen in Figure S11), similar to
the rectifying behavior observed for the control back-gates.
Similarly to the back-gate, some aspects of top-gate performance for the control set were
comparable to those of the EM-FGA set. Drive currents approached 10 μA/μm at large and
positive VTG, and μFE was found to be (4.1 ± 0.3) cm2/V·s prior to correcting for the contact
resistance (Table 1). However, also similar to the back-gate, a large and negative shift in VT
(Figure 4a, green) was observed in the top-gate for the control set, which again precluded an
accurate estimation of the Ion/Ioff ratio, the subthreshold swing, and VT for the control FETs
without inducing dielectric breakdown in the gate dielectric (all transfer curves can be seen in
Figure S12). We also note that the large and negative shift in VT for the control top-gates
permitted a more accurate estimate of gm,max than the EM-FGA top-gates where gm,max is likely
underestimated because IDS is still increasing at 4 V, which was the maximum VTG that could be
applied without inducing dielectric breakdown (Figure 4a). This results in underestimations of
gm,max and μFE for the EM-FGA FETs relative to the control FETs..
In summary, the observed performance benefits of the EM-FGA process are threefold: i) by
drastically reducing the interface contamination and trap charges, a controlled VT shift on both
the back-gate and top-gate closer to the ideal value was achieved, which in turn improves
performance and reproducibility of FETs fabricated using this approach closer to the level
16

needed for integration in logic circuits,58,

65

ii) Ohmic metal-MoS2 contacts were achieved,

evident by the linear IDS-VDS characteristics, with a low contact resistance, and iii) important FET
characteristics including μFE, subthreshold swing, and Ion/Ioff ratio were maintained at values
previously reported for FETs fabricated from MoS2 sourced from traditional mechanical
exfoliation. Furthermore, the benefits of EM-FGA were achieved using only a tube furnace
operating at relatively high pressures, i.e., 350 Pa (2.6 Torr), which makes the technique
straightforward to implement without the need for highly specialized equipment.48-50, 52, 56 The
EM-FGA process is gentle and minimizes damage to the large monolayers obtained through
metal-mediated exfoliation, unlike other commonly used cleaning techniques that utilize UVozone which has been shown to create disadvantageous MoOx or even eliminate transistor
behavior in FETs.48,

51, 66

We expect EM-FGA to be a critical component of the streamlined

processing of 2D materials obtained using increasingly widespread metal-mediated exfoliation
techniques.43,

46, 67-68

Finally, to better describe the mechanism underlying improved FET

performance in this work, we performed several complimentary measurements on the
monolayers from which the FETs were fabricated, as described next.
2.3 Monolayer Characterization with Raman, XPS and AFM
Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and AFM were used to quantify the effects of the EM-FGA on
the morphology and chemical composition of MoS2 monolayers obtained from metal-mediated
exfoliation. All monolayers analyzed here were prepared using the process steps outlined in
Methods, identical to the monolayers used to fabricate the FETs, up to the deposition of the topgate oxide.
Raman Spectroscopy: Raman spectra of monolayer MoS2 are shown in Figure 1b. As discussed
earlier, the separation between the E12g and A1g peaks in the spectrum were in agreement with the
expected shift55 for monolayer MoS2 with a thickness of ≈ 0.7 nm and yielded a frequency
17

difference of 16.6 cm−1. The EM-FGA process increased the peak separation frequency
to 19.4 cm−1, within the range observed for monolayer MoS2.55 On the other hand, as seen from
Figure 1b, samples processed with the EM-FGA demonstrated a dramatic overall increase in the
peak intensity (blue) relative to the as-exfoliated sample (orange), and narrower E2g peak widths
(4.9 cm−1 compared to 7.3 cm−1) suggesting the EM-FGA results in lower contamination and
reduces defects in the MoS2 crystal structure. A similar improvement to the material composition
was previously observed for multilayer MoS2 annealed with elemental sulfur.69

material forming gas annealing (EM-FGA). (a) XPS spectra for Mo, S, and C before the EM-FGA and (b)
after the EM-FGA illustrating the elimination of MoO2 and species containing C=O bonds, and a
reduction of species containing C-O bonds while the presence of Mo4+ and S2- were constant.

18

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): XPS spectra for three elements, Mo, S, and C,
obtained from a MoS2 monolayer before and after EM-FGA is illustrated in Figure 5. All spectral
data are calibrated with the C 1s peak at a constant binding energy of » 284.6 eV. Both before
and after the EM-FGA, the Mo 3d shows two main peaks at 229.8 eV and 232.9 eV which are
attributed to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, confirming the existence of Mo4+. The S XPS
spectrum displays peaks at 162.7 eV and 163.81 eV that can be attributed to the doublet S 2p3/2
and S 2p1/2, respectively, corresponding to the divalent sulfur ion (S2−) of MoS2. However, the
sample measured before the EM-FGA displays » 5 % of MoO2 on the channel, as evidenced by
the two peaks at 231.0 eV (Mo 3d5/2) and 234.0 eV (Mo 3d3/2). These peaks are not observed
after the EM-FGA, indicating that EM-FGA removes insulating and disadvantageous MoO2 that
forms on the surface of the monolayer.
Figure 5 also demonstrates changes in the C 1s peaks, which illuminate changes in organic
contamination. The deconvolution of these peak illustrates the existence of organic compounds
before EM-FGA due to the presence of C-C, C-O, and C=O bonds. After the EM-FGA, the
intensity of C=O is not detectable and the intensity of C-O decreases, strongly indicating the
removal of surface organic contamination. Furthermore, the C content was reduced by more than
90% after the EM-FGA, indicating that the EM-FGA method effectively reduces organic surface
contamination.
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM): MoS2 monolayers were also characterized using AFM
imaging before and after the EM-FGA to assess changes in surface morphology as illustrated in
Figure 6. The topography of the underlying SiO2 substrate changed visibly after the EM-FGA
procedure (Figure 6a and 6b), but changes in the MoS2 monolayer were more subtle. The
average surface roughness measured on the SiO2 substrate from the topography image reduced
19

» 40 % after the EM-FGA process from 892 pm to 510 pm. On the other hand, surface roughness
appeared virtually unchanged for MoS2. Complementary information was obtained by a careful
analysis of the phase image of the same sample as seen in Figures 6c and 6d. In those images, we
observed distinct and visible changes to both the SiO2 and MoS2 surfaces following EM-FGA.
Prior to EM-FGA, the distribution of phase angles (Figure 6c, inset) on both the SiO2 and MoS2
surfaces was long-tailed indicating phase non-uniformity. This behavior was consistent with
previous observations of contamination in graphene.70 Following EM-FGA, the phase angle
distributions were considerably more uniform and followed a Gaussian distribution suggesting
removal of surface contamination. The result agrees with the XPS measurements that show both
removal of organic contamination and improvement to the stoichiometry of the MoS2.

3. Conclusion
We demonstrate a new process that markedly improved reproducibility and performance of
FETs fabricated from MoS2 monolayers sourced from metal-mediated exfoliation. The EM-FGA
process demonstrated in this work improved both the top and back-gate performance of the
FETs, as quantified by nearly ideal and reproducible threshold voltages, and Ohmic behavior of
the source and drain contacts. Furthermore, common device metrics to estimate performance
such as subthreshold slope, drive current, and field-effect mobility of the semiconducting MoS2
were found to be comparable to previous reports of state-of-the-art FETs fabricated by
mechanical exfoliation of MoS2. These improvements demonstrate that the EM-FGA remarkably
improve the MoS2-gate oxide interfaces by removing trapped charges that can degrade electrical
performance. As large area 2D material flakes become more commonplace due to continued
interest in the metal-mediated exfoliation method,42,

67

the improved processing techniques

reported here will be critical to enable the fabrication of components from 2D materials in logic
circuits for numerous applications.
The combination of the Raman, XPS, and AFM results support the conclusion that the EMFGA improves the quality and composition of the MoS2 monolayer resulting in improved FET
performance. The improvements were found to be two-fold; (i) the EM-FGA process drastically
decreased organic contaminants on the semiconducting material and surrounding back-gate
dielectric, which can dope the channel and lead to an uncontrolled flatband voltage shift, and (ii)
the EM-FGA process eliminated the presence of MoO2 species which can be disadvantageously
insulating. Lastly, the increase of anneal time performed on the exposed MoS2 resulted in no
observable detrimental effects on FET performance or destruction of the MoS2.
The methods detailed in this work will have an immediate impact when realizing devices that
use 2D materials sourced from metal-mediated exfoliation and could help in the development of
22

2D heterostructure devices where there is a stringent requirement for interface cleanliness and
material quality. Finally, EM-FGA can potentially be applied to CVD or PVD grown material to
improve material composition. We will extend our processing approach to improve the yield and
reproducibility for synthesized 2D materials in future works.
4. Methods
FET Fabrication: Low resistivity (R < 0.005 Ω-cm) Si wafers with 70 nm SiO2 were cleaned
for 15 minutes at 75 °C in an agitated bath of 5:1:1 DI water/ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen
peroxide. MoS2 was prepared by gold-mediated exfoliation as described previously42: MoS2 was
exfoliated from a bulk source onto adhesive tape which was then coated with 110 nm gold Au
using electron beam deposition. Thermal-release tape was then used to transfer the gold-coated
MoS2 onto the wafers which were subsequently treated with oxygen plasma at 150 W and 30
cm3/min at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 0 °C and 101 kPa, respectively (30 sccm),
and 4 Pa (30 mTorr) for 4 minutes to remove residual contamination from the tape while the Au
protected the MoS2. The Au was finally removed with Au etchant TFA (8 wt % Iodine, 21 wt %
Potassium Iodide, 71 wt % water; Transene Inc., Danvers, MA) for 4 minutes and then cleaned
with distilled (DI) water for 10 minutes, acetone for 30 minutes at 45 °C, and then rinsed with DI
water and gently blown dry with N2.
After the transfer was complete, the presence of monolayers was confirmed with Raman
spectroscopy. Source and drain contacts were patterned onto the entire wafer (i.e., not targeting
specific monolayers) by using optical lithography with a stepper. The source and drain contacts
were metallized with electron beam deposition of 2 nm Ti and 80 nm Au. Arrays were inspected
for source and drain contact overlap of monolayers using optical microscopy and targeted for
channel patterning. 5 μm ´ 5 μm MoS2 channels were patterned using optical lithography and
then etched into the monolayer with XeF2 at 100 Pa (1 Torr) and 3 second pulses. For most
23

monolayers, between 10 and 14 pulses were used to fully etch the monolayer. For Raman, XPS,
and AFM analysis, samples were processed identically (except for electron beam metal
deposition) to mimic processing conditions prior to the EM-FGA.
The EM-FGA was performed on the FETs for 24 hours in a tube furnace at 350 Pa (2.6 Torr)
and 400 °C with 100 cm3/min forming gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 0 °C and
101 kPa, respectively (100 sccm) of 95:5 N2/H2. EM-FGA FETs were immediately transferred to
a reactor for atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 as opposed to control FETs where the FGA
was performed after Al2O3 deposition. For ALD, saturating doses of trimethylaluminum and
water vapor were alternately injected into a custom, warm-walled ALD reactor with a constant
flow of ultra-high purity N2 serving as a carrier gas for the reactants and as a purge gas between
injections. The substrate was heated to 210 °C while the walls and gas lines were maintained at
110 °C. Under similar conditions, the deposition rate of Al2O3 was previously found using
spectroscopic ellipsometry to be (0.103 ± 0.007) nm per cycle on SiO2. A total of 200 cycles
were performed to deposit ≈ 20 nm of top-gate Al2O3.
Finally, top-gates were patterned onto both sets of FETs using optical lithography and
electron beam deposition to deposit 10 nm Ti and 100 nm Au. A second FGA was then
performed for 4 hours in a tube furnace at 350 Pa (2.6 Torr) and 400 °C using 100 sccm of 95:5
N2/H2.
FET Performance Characterization: I-V characterization was performed during processing
using a probe station and parameter analyzer. FETs were tested using standard IDSVDS and IDSVG
measurement protocols for the back-gate where for IDSVDS, VDS was swept from 0 V to 1 V and
VG was stepped three times from −10 V, 0 V, and 10 V, and for IDSVG, VDS was stepped six times
(0.05, 0.25, 0.45, 0.65, 0.85, 1.05) V and VG was swept between −30 V to 25 V. A similar
protocol was used for the top-gate, but for IDSVDS, VG was set to either −4 V, 0 V, and 4 V, and
24

for IDSVG, VG was swept from either −6 V to 5 V. All back-gate measurements were made before
deposition of the top-gate metal and all top-gate measurements were made with VBG grounded.
The ideal VT for a monolayer FET was calculated using the method outlined by Ma, et al.60
where the local channel electrostatic potential (Vch) and channel electron density (nch) must
satisfy

(1) – (3) were solved numerically to obtain the ideal VT for both a back-gate and top-gate

Contact resistance was obtained using 4-point and 2-point probe measurements with the
back-gate and top-gates floating. For the 4-point measurement, a constant VDS = 1 V was applied
to the first contact, V was measured across the second and third contacts where I was kept
constant at zero, and the fourth contact was grounded to yield 𝑅lw,Yx =

the best fit lines to the I-V data as shown in Figure S8.
Raman Spectroscopy: Raman spectra were acquired in a Renishaw InVia microscope
spectrometer with laser excitation at 514 nm. All Raman peaks were calibrated based on the Si
peak (520.7 cm−1) and fitted with Gaussian-Lorentzian line shapes to determine the peak
position, the line width, and the intensity of different components.
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy: XPS Spectra were acquired on a Kratos Axis UltraDLD
XPS/UPS system, under a base pressure of 0.135 μPa (10−9 Torr), using the monochromatic Al
Kα line. The XPS spectra were calibrated using adventitious carbon at » 284.8 eV.
Atomic Force Microscopy: AFM images were acquired on an Asylum AFM with the tip in
tapping mode to acquire both topographical and phase changes of the MoS2 and the surrounding
SiO2 substrate. Scanning was performed at room temperature with settings optimized for 2D
materials.
