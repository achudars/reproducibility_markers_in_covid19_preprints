Abstract. We investigate the geometry of étale 4 : 1 coverings of smooth complex genus 2 curves
with the monodromy group isomorphic to the Klein four-group. There are two cases, isotropic and
non-isotropic depending on the values of the Weil pairing restricted to the group defining the covering.
We recall from our previous work [4] the results concerning the non-isotropic case and fully describe the
isotropic case. We show that the necessary information to construct the Klein coverings is encoded in
the 6 points on P1 defining the genus 2 curve. The main result of the paper is the fact that, in both cases
the Prym map associated to these coverings is injective. Additionally, we provide a concrete description
of the closure of the image of the Prym map inside the corresponding moduli space of polarised abelian
varieties.

1. Introduction
Classically, Prym varieties are principally polarized abelian varieties arising from étale double coverings
f : C 0 → C between smooth curves. The Prym variety of such a covering is the complementary abelian
subvariety to the image of f ∗ (JC) inside the Jacobian JC 0 . By extending this to the moduli space of
coverings one can define the Prym map to the moduli space Ag of principally polarised abelian varieties
(ppav). It is known that the Prym map is dominant for g ≤ 5 ([21]), so the general ppav of dimension
≤ 5 is a Prym variety. Mumford revived the theory of Prym varieties by investigating in [16] the relations
between the Jacobian of C 0 and the Prym variety P (C 0 /C), which are known as the Schottky-Jung
relations. For g ≥ 7 the Prym map is generically injective but never injective ([5], [6], [8], [20]). The
study of the the Prym map for étale double coverings of genus 6 curves led to the result that A5 is
unirational ([19]). These results inspired the research of Pryms for other coverings, which are no longer
principally polarised. The Torelli problem in the case of Pryms of ramified double coverings has been
fully solved in a series of recent papers [17, 14, 15] and the case of étale cyclic coverings has been covered
in [12].
The main aim of this paper is to go a step further and study the most basic non-cyclic coverings,
namely étale 4 : 1 coverings of genus 2 curves with monodromy group isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
These are examples of bidouble coverings but in the case curves we call them Klein coverings. Since the
group is non-cyclic, it turns out that the space of such coverings have two disjoint components depending
on the values of the Weil pairing restricted to the group defining the covering, called isotropic and nonisotropic. The non-isotropic case has appeared naturally in the investigation of smooth hyperelliptic
curves that can be embedded into abelian surfaces ([4]). One of the results of [4] is that such curves are
non-isotropic Klein coverings of genus 2 curves. In this paper we show that the corresponding Prym map
for non-isotropic Klein coverings over genus 2 curves is injective (see Theorem 3.8).
The isotropic case is quite different from the non-isotropic case since the covering is not longer hyperelliptic. The good side of the story is that we get more non-trivial quotient curves and in particular we
have been able to show that the Prym variety of the covering is the image of the Jacobian of one of them.
This allows us to show that in this case, the Prym map is also injective (see Theorem 4.11).
Putting the two theorems together we get the main result of the paper as follows.

Theorem 1.1. Let H be a smooth complex genus 2 curve and V4 be a Klein four-subgroup of the group
of two torsion points on the Jacobian JH. The space of Klein coverings is the disjoint union R2iso ∪ R2ni
depending on whether V4 is isotropic or non-isotropic with respect to the Weil pairing. Moreover, the
Prym maps
(1,2,2)
Priso : Riso
2 −→ A3
(1,1,4)

Prni : Rni

are both injective onto their images.

The idea of the proof is that the Klein covering provides a tower of curves in which one can find elliptic
curves that generate the Prym variety. Then we show that all the information is actually contained in
the division of 6 points on P1 into 3 pairs in the isotropic case and 2 triples in the non-isotropic case.
This in particular shows that R2iso and R2ni are irreducible.
The paper is structured as follows. In the Preliminaries we collect the necessary results on curves with
involutions. An interesting result on its own is the characterisation of non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 3
admitting 2 commuting involutions (see Lemma 2.15) and their Jacobians, (see Proposition 2.16). Such
curves will play crucial role in the isotropic Klein coverings.
Section 3 is devoted to non-isotropic Klein coverings. It consists of a summary of results from [4] and
Theorem 3.8 that states that the Prym map in this case is injective. Section 4 explains the construction
of isotropic Klein coverings. Here, we characterise the curves that appear as quotient curves and the
covering maps between them. The conclusion is Theorem 4.11 that states that the Prym map is injective
also in this case. In Section 5 we give a precise description, in terms of period matrices, of the image of
the Prym map in both cases.

2. Preliminaries
In the paper we deal with elliptic curves, i.e. genus 1 curve with a chosen point. In this way, an elliptic
curve is a one dimensional abelian variety. Thus, the involution −1 becomes a (hyper)elliptic involution
and we define the Weierstrass points on an elliptic curve as the 2-torsion points, i.e. the fixed points of
the involution.
A double covering f : C 0 → C can be defined from upstairs as the quotient of C 0 by an involution σ so
that C = C 0 /σ, or from downstairs by fixing a branching divisor B on C and a line bundle L such that
L⊗2 = OC (B). In the paper we use both perspectives. If σ is the involution that exchanges the sheets of
the covering, then we denote by Cσ the quotient curve. Sometimes, to stress that the quotient curve is
elliptic, we write Eσ = C/σ instead of Cσ .
As in [4], we define Klein coverings as follows:
e → C with monodromy group
Definition 2.1. A Klein covering of a curve C is a 4:1 étale covering f : C
isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4 = Z2 × Z2 . In particular, it is defined by a Klein four-subgroup G
of the set of 2-torsion points on the Jacobian JC, denoted by JC[2].
In [4] we have shown that there are two disjoint cases of Klein coverings that depends on the values
of the Weil pairing restricted to G.

3

Definition 2.2. We call a Klein covering isotropic if the group G ⊂ JC[2] defining the covering is
isotropic with respect to the Weil pairing. In the other case, we call the covering non-isotropic.
Remark 2.3. Let H be a hyperelliptic curve of genus g. Recall from [4, 7] that every 2-torsion point
on JH can be written uniquely as a sum of an even number of at most g Weierstrass points, so the Weil
paring of η1 , η2 ∈ JH[2] can be computed as the parity of the number of common Weierstrass points in
the presentations of η1 , η2 .
Through the paper the involution ι will always denote the hyperelliptic involution. We recall the basic
facts about involutions and their lifts.
Lemma 2.4. Let f : C → Cτ be the double covering given by the fixed point free involution τ . Let ρ be
an involution on Cτ and denote Fix(ρ) the set of fixed points. Let r, rτ be the lifts of ρ. Then Fix(r) and
Fix(rτ ) are disjoint, their cardinalities are divisible by 4 and f −1 (Fix(ρ)) = Fix(r) ∪ Fix(rτ ) is twice the
cardinality of Fix(ρ).
Proof. Let Cτ be of genus g. Then C is of genus 2g + 1. Using Hurwitz formula, for any involution, say
α on C we have
2(2g + 1) − 2 = 2(2gα − 2) + | Fix(α)|.
hence Fix(α) has cardinality divisible by 4.
If x ∈ Fix(ρ) and f −1 (x) = {P, Q} then either r(P ) = P and r(Q) = Q or r(P ) = Q and r(Q) = P .
In the former case, rτ exchange points in the fibre and in the latter case rτ fixes them. Hence every
preimage of a fixed point of ρ belongs to exactly one fixed point set.

As an easy, yet important consequence of the proof, we get the following corollary.
Corollary 2.5. Let f : C → Cτ be a double covering. Then any lift of an involution with at least one
fixed point that is not a branch point of f is again an involution.
All the involutions in the paper whose lift is considered satisfy the condition of Corollary 2.5, so in
the sequel the lift of an involution under a double covering is again an involution.
Lemma 2.6. Let W = {w1 , . . . , w2g+2 } be the set of Weierstrass points on a hyperelliptic curve H of
genus g. Then for any subset A of size g + 1 we have the following equality in Picg+1 (H)
X
X
wi =
wj
wi ∈A

wj ∈W \A

Proof. When one considers an equation of a hyperelliptic curve, then all Weierstrass points become roots
of a polynomial. This means in particular that the sum of all Weierstrass points is linear equivalent to
(2g + 2)P where P is the preimage of the infinity. Hence
X
X
X
wi ∼ (2g + 2)P ⇒
wi − (g + 1)P ∼ (g + 1)P −
wi
wi ∈W

wi ∈A

wi ∈W \A

Since Weierstrass points are 2-torsion points in the Jacobian of H, one gets the result.



Corollary 2.7. For an elliptic curve E one has w1 + w2 = w3 + w4 for wi ∈ E[2].
For a genus 2 curve H one has w1 − w2 + w3 − w4 = w5 − w6 .
Recall the following conditions of a double covering to be hyperelliptic:
Proposition 2.8 ([4]). Let H be a hyperelliptic curve of genus g and h : C → H an étale double covering
defined by η ∈ JH[2] \ {0}. Then C is hyperelliptic if and only if η = OH (w1 − w2 ), where w1 , w2 ∈ H
are Weierstrass points.

Lemma 2.9. A double cover π : C → E of an elliptic curve branched along 4 points of the form
x, ιE x, y, ιE y is hyperelliptic of genus 3 if and only if the line bundle defining the covering is the hyperelliptic bundle.
Proof. Let B = x + ιE x + y + ιE y be the branch divisor of the covering π : C → E and η ∈ Pic2 (E) be
the line bundle defining π, so η 2 ' OE (B) = OE (2HE ), where HE denotes the (hyper)elliptic divisor.
Suppose that C is hyperelliptic with hyperelliptic divisor HC . Then π ∗ HE = π ∗ (2w1 ) = 2HC
By the projection formula
H 0 (C, OC (2HC ))

= H 0 (C, π ∗ OE (HE ))
= H 0 (E, OE (HE ) ⊗ π∗ (OC ))
= H 0 (E, OE (HE )) ⊕ H 0 (E, OE (HE )) ⊗ η −1 ).

Since h0 (C, OC (2HC )) = h0 (C, ωC ) = 3, necessarily h0 (E, OE (HE )) ⊗ η −1 ) = 1, hence η ' OE (HE )).
Conversely, if η = OE (HE )) then, again by the projection formula, one computes
h0 (C, π ∗ OE (HE )) = h0 (E, OE (HE )) + h0 (E, OE (HE ) ⊗ η −1 ) = 3.
According to Clifford’s theorem C is hyperelliptic and π ∗ OE (HE ) a multiple of the hyperelliptic bundle.

2.1. Curves with a Z22 group of involutions. We start by considering involutions on hyperelliptic
curves.
Lemma 2.10. Let X be a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus g = 2k + 1. with ι the hyperelliptic
involution. For any τ ∈ Aut(X), τ 2 = id, τ 6= ι we have
Fix(τ ) = ∅, | Fix(ιτ )| = 4,

or

| Fix(τ )| = 4, Fix(ιτ ) = ∅.

Proof. According to Accola’s Theorem ([1, Theorem 5.9]) applied to the group G0 = hι, τ i we have
(2.1)

2(2k + 1) = 2g(X/τ ) + 2g(X/ιτ ).

By Hurwitz formula one deduces that g(X/τ ) ≤ k + 1 and g(X/ιτ ) ≤ k + 1. Together with (2.1) this
implies g(X/τ ) = k + 1 and g(X/ιτ ) = k or vice versa.

Remark 2.11. Geometrically, Lemma 2.10 means that if a hyperelliptic curve of genus g = 2k + 1 is a
double covering then the covering is étale or branched in 4 points. Moreover, if one case occurs then the
other, too.
Lemma 2.12. Let C be a genus 3 curve with two involutions. Then C is hyperelliptic if and only if C
is an étale double cover of a genus 2 curve H.
Proof. One implication is the case k = 1 of Lemma 2.10. The other follows from Proposition 2.8.



Lemma 2.13. With the assumptions of Lemma 2.10 and σ, τ fix-point free involutions, then στ is also
a fix-point-free involution for k an even number.
Proof. Set g0 = g(X/hτ, στ i) and gα = g(X/α), for α ∈ Aut(X). We apply Accola’s theorem ([1]) to the
group G0 = hτ, στ i to obtain
2(2k + 1) + 4g0
2k + 1 + 2g0

=

2gσ + 2gτ + 2gστ

= gσ + gτ + gστ
=

2k + 2 + gστ .

Since the left hand side is odd we conclude that gστ is odd. By Lemma 2.10 applied to στ we get that
gστ = k + 1 or gστ = k. Thus, if k is even gστ = k + 1 and στ is fix-point-free.


Remark 2.14. The fact that X is hyperelliptic in Lemma 2.13 is crucial. Proposition 4.1 shows an
example when involutions σ, j are fixed point free on a non-hyperelliptic genus 5 curve and jσ has 8 fixed
points.
For non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 3, we get the following results.
Lemma 2.15. Let σ, τ ∈ Aut(C) be two commuting involutions on a non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curve C.
Then C is a double covering of three elliptic curves, i.e. all 3 involutions are bielliptic. In this case the
sum of points in Fix(σ) (respectively in Fix(τ ) and Fix(στ )) form a divisor linearly equivalent to KC .
Moreover, C is a 4 : 1 covering of P1 with the monodromy group isomorphic to the Klein four-group and
the branching divisor being 6 points (images of 12 fixed points).
Proof. By Lemma 2.12 the quotient curves cannot be of genus 2 and by assumption cannot be of genus
0, so all involutions are bielliptic. The second part follows from the fact that the canonical divisor of an
elliptic curve is trivial, so the canonical divisor of a curve equals the ramification divisor of an elliptic
covering, that is the fixed points divisor of an involution. By the commutativity of the three involutions,
the actions on Fix(σ) of τ and στ have to be equal to each other and equal to the pair of transpositions.
In particular, the covering C → C/hσ, τ i has branching divisor at least as stated. Hurwitz formula gives
2 · 3 − 2 = 4 · (2 · 0 − 2) + deg(R),
hence deg(R) = 12 and the branching divisor is exactly as stated.



Consider the elliptic curves Eσ , Eτ and Eστ as subvarieties of JC as follows
Eσ = Im(1 + σ) = Fix(σ),

Eτ = Im(1 + τ ) = Fix(τ ),

Eστ = Im(1 + στ ) = Fix(στ ).

Here, we abuse the notation by writing the same letter for the automorphism of a curve and its extension
to the Jacobian. We denote by P (C/E) the Prym variety of the covering, for definition see Section 2.2.
Proposition 2.16. The map ϕ : Eσ × Eτ × Eστ → JC is an isogeny of degree 8.
Proof. Since the varieties are of the same dimension it is enough to show that the kernel of ϕ is finite
and in fact of cardinality 8. First, we consider the addition map
ϕστ : Eσ × Eτ → P (C/Eστ ),

(a, b) 7→ a + b,

where P (C/Eστ ) denotes the Prym variety of the map C → Eστ . Let aα : C → Eα and bα : Eα → P1
be the quotient maps with α ∈ {σ, τ, στ }. Notice that the maps a∗α : Eα → JC are injective. Using the
results in [18, Appendix] we have that
ker ϕστ = a∗σ (Eσ [2]) ∩ a∗τ (Eτ [2]).
We shall give a precise description of this kernel. Let
Fix(σ)

=

{S1 , S2 , τ (S1 ), τ (S2 )}

Fix(τ )

=

{T1 , T2 , σ(T1 ), σ(T2 )}

Fix(στ )

=

{R1 , R2 , τ (R1 ), τ (R2 )}

be the sets of fixed points in C of the automorphisms σ, τ, στ respectively. Then for i = 1, 2
{aσ (Ti ), aσ (Ri )},

{aτ (Ri ), aτ (Si )},

{aστ (Ti ), aστ (Si )}

are the ramification points of bσ , bτ , bστ respectively. Thus
Eσ [2]

= {0, [aσ (R1 ) − aσ (T1 )], [aσ (R1 ) − aσ (T2 )], [aσ (R1 ) − aσ (R2 )]}

Eτ [2]

= {0, [aτ (R1 ) − aτ (S1 )], [aτ (R1 ) − aτ (S2 )], [aτ (R1 ) − aτ (R2 )]}

and analogously, one can describe the 2-torsion points of Eστ . From this we clearly have
a∗σ (Eσ [2]) ∩ a∗τ (Eτ [2]) = {0, [R1 + σ(R1 ) − (R2 + σ(R2 ))]},

6

by observing that τ (Ri ) = σRi , i = 1, 2. Therefore | ker ϕστ | = 2.
On the other hand, the kernel of the addition map
ψ : P (C/Eστ ) × Eστ → JC
is given by the set {(c, c) | c ∈ Eστ [2]}, since P (C/Eστ ) ∩ Eστ = ker(1 + στ ) ∩ Eστ = Eστ [2]. It follows
that the kernel of the composition map
ϕστ ×id

ψ

Eσ × Eτ × Eστ −→ P (C/Eστ ) × Eστ −→ JC
has cardinality equal to | ker ϕστ | · |Eστ [2]| = 8.



If ΘC denotes the principal polarisation on JC, one can check that ϕ∗ (ΘC ) is algebraically equivalent
to twice the principal product polarisation on Eσ × Eτ × Eστ . Using the fact that an embedding of an
elliptic curve E in a Jacobian JC is equivalent to having a covering C → E, we get the inverse statement:
Corollary 2.17. If the Jacobian of a non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curve C is polarised isogenous to the
product of three elliptic curves with twice the principal polarisation, then Aut(C) contains a Z22 group of
involutions.
Remark 2.18. Note that to write the proof of Proposition 2.16 we broke the natural symmetry. It is
easy to see that Si + τ (Si ), Ti + σ(Ti ) and Ri + τ (Ri ) are divisors fixed by all three involutions. Since
the intersection of three the elliptic curves in JC consists of 0 and a 2-torsion point, one sees that all the
respective differences are actually equal to each other.
We summarise the description of genus 3 curves with the following corollary.
Corollary 2.19. Let C be a non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curve admitting a Z32 subgroup of automorphisms.
Then, its Jacobian contains a distinguished (non-zero) 2-torsion point lying in the intersection of three
elliptic curves.
2.2. Some results concerning abelian varieties. We start by recalling the definition of a Prym
variety. A finite morphism f : C 0 → C between smooth curves induces a homomorphism of groups
Nmf : JC 0 → JC between the Jacobians, called the norm map defined by pushing down divisors of
degree zero:
X
X
Nmf : [
ni pi ] → [
ni f (pi )].
i

When f is étale the kernel of Nmf consists of several connected components, so the Prym variety of f is
the defined as the connected component of ker Nmf containing the zero element:
P = P (C 0 /C) := (ker Nmf )0 .
It is of dimension dim P = g(C 0 ) − g(C) (the difference of the genera of the curves) and as an abelian
subvariety of JC 0 has a natural polarization Ξ, induced by the restriction of the principal polarization of
JC 0 . In particular, the Prym variety can be seen as a complementary abelian subvariety to the image of
f ∗ (JC) inside JC 0 . It is well-known that Ξ is principal if f is of degree 2, étale or ramified at 2 points1.
The Prym map given by [f : C 0 → C] 7→ (P, Ξ) is defined from a suitable moduli space of coverings of
smooth curves to the moduli space of D-polarised abelian varieties AD
dim P .
The Prym maps considered here have their image in a special loci of the moduli of D-polarised abelian
threefolds AD
3 . Consider the space
3
B D = {A ∈ AD
3 : Z2 ⊂ Aut(A)}.
1 The are only two other cases where the P gets a principal polarisation: (1) g(C) = 1 and g(C 0 ) = 2; and (2) g(C) = 2
and f is non-cyclic of degree 3.

7

Lemma 2.20. The locus B D is of dimension 3 and is contained in the set of abelian varieties that are
isogenous to the product of elliptic curves.
Proof. This fact is a consequence of the representation theory of finite abelian groups. The group algebra
Q[Z32 ] has 3 central orthogonal idempotents, hence every abelian threefold in B D has to be isogenous to
the product of 3 elliptic curves. This lemma can be seen as a special case of [13, Prop 1.1].

Remark 2.21. Note that in general B D is not irreducible. For any D, one of the irreducible components
is the locus of products of 3 elliptic curves. Consider the locus of smooth non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves
with a Z22 subgroup of automorphisms (see Lemma 2.15). Their Jacobians are principally polarised
abelian threefolds that are not polarised products and their group of automorphisms is Z32 (because -1
does not come from automorphisms of a curve), so they form another component of B (1,1,1) .
3. Klein coverings: Non-isotropic case
Let H be a curve of genus 2 and h : C → H an étale double covering, so C is of genus 3. Let σ denote
the automorphism exchanging two sheets of the covering and j a lift of the hyperelliptic involution of H.
Let W = {w1 , . . . , w6 } ⊂ H be the set of Weierstrass points. The curve C has the action of the Klein
group Z2 × Z2 = hj, σ : j 2 = σ 2 = 1, jσ = σji. So the curve C is hyperelliptic (cf. Lemma 2.12).
e → C, where C
e is of genus 5 and let τ denote the
We consider now an étale double covering of C, f : C
e which
involution exchanging the sheets of the covering. Suppose that j and σ lift to involutions on C,
we shall denote with the same letters, in a such way that
Z32 = hj, σ, τ : j 2 = σ 2 = τ 2 = 1, jσ = σj, τ σ = στ, τ j = jτ i.
Let η ∈ JH[2] \ {0} be the 2-torsion point defining the covering h and ξ ∈ JH[2] \ {0} such that
h∗ ξ ∈ JC[2] \ {0} defines the double covering f . Assume that the group G = hη, ξi is non-isotropic. The
following theorem summarises the results from [4] in the non-isotropic case.
Theorem 3.1. The following data are equivalent:
(1) a general (1, 4)-polarised abelian surface A;
(2) a triple (H, η, ξ), with H a genus 2 curve and η, ξ generators of a non-isotropic Klein subgroup
of JH[2];
e a hyperelliptic curve of genus 5 with Z3 ⊂ Aut(C);
e
(3) C
2
(4) a genus 2 curve H together with the choice of 3 points of the ramification locus of the double
covering H → P1 ;
(5) the set of 6 points on P1 with a chosen triple of them, up to projective equivalence (respecting the
triple).
Remark 3.2. There is a unique line bundle of characteristic 0 associated to the (1, 4)-polarisation, such
that the (−1)-action split its space of sections in symmetric and anti-symmetric theta functions. The
anti-symmetric subspace is one-dimensional. In the first statement of Theorem 3.1 a surface is general if
the zero-set of the unique anti-symmetric theta function is a smooth curve of genus 5 (see [4] for details).
Proof. The equivalence (1) ⇔ (2) follows from [4, Theorem 4.12]. The equivalence (4) ⇔ (5) follows
from the construction of genus 2 curves. The implication (2) ⇒ (3) is clear from the construction of
e and [4, Theorem 4.7]. The equivalence (2) ⇔ (4) follows from the fact that any non-trivial 2-torsion
C
point of H can be written as the difference of two (distinct) Weierstrass points. Moreover, η1 = wi − wj ,
η2 = wk − wl generate a non-isotropic subgroup of JH[2] if and only if they share a Weierstrass point,
i.e. |{wi , wj } ∩ {wk , wl }| = 1, see Remark 2.3.
It remains to show the implication (3) ⇒ (2). By Lemma 2.10 (with k = 2) one can assume that τ and
σ are fix-point-free involutions. So, by Lemma 2.13, στ is also fix-point-free involution. In conclusion, in

Remark 3.4. As pointed out in [4], the conditions of Theorem 3.1 carry natural ’dualisations’. In the
first condition one can take the dual surface. In the fourth and fifth condition one can take the remaining
triple. In the second condition one takes the orthogonal complement to the Klein subgroup with respect
to the Weil pairing.

Remark 3.5. Figure 1 shows how to construct all the curves in the covering starting from 6 points in
P1 . In particular if H is branched at 0, 1, ∞, b1 , b2 , b3 then the elliptic curves Eσ , Eτ , Eστ are branched
at 0, 1, ∞ and bi .
In order to show injectivity of the Prym map, we start with some results concerning the Prym variety.

(a, b, c) 7→ a + b + c,

defines an isogeny of degree 16. Moreover, there is a polarisation Ξ of type (1, 1, 4) on P , such that ϕ∗ Ξ
is algebraically equivalent to four times the principal polarisation on Eσ × Eτ × Eστ .
Proof. The fact that ϕ is an isogeny and the restriction of the principal polarisation Ξ := ΘJ Ce |P is of
type (1, 1, 4) is proven in [4, Theorem 5.5]. Consider the following commutative diagram.

Clearly, ker ϕ ⊂ ker λϕ∗ Ξ and since Ξ is of type (1, 1, 4), deg λΞ = 16. In order to compute the degree of
e
ϕ we consider the description of the elliptic curves as fixed loci inside of the Jacobian of C:
Eσ = Fix(σ, ιτ ),

Eτ = Fix(τ, ισ) Eστ = Fix(ιτ, ισ).

Let (a, b, c) ∈ ker ϕ, then c = −a − b. Applying ισ and ιτ to −a − b we get
ισ(−a − b) = −ιa − b = −a − b

and

ιτ (−a − b) = −a − ιb = −a − b,

so ιa = a and ιb = b, that is, a, b and c are 2-torsion points in their respective elliptic curves. This implies
(3.2)

ker ϕ = {(a, b, −a − b) | a ∈ Eσ [2], b ∈ Eτ [2]},

in particular that | ker ϕ| = 16. Since deg ϕ̂ = deg ϕ = 16, we have deg λϕ∗ Ξ = 163 = 46 . This together
with the fact ker λϕ∗ Ξ ⊂ Eσ [4] × Eτ [4] × Eστ [4], implies that λϕ∗ Ξ is four times the principal polarisation.
One can also argue that since the elliptic curves are quotients by subgroups of order 4, the respective
coverings have to be 4 : 1 and hence the restricted polarisations have to be of type (4). Then ϕ, as an
addition map, becomes a polarised isogeny.

Denote by Z the set of 2-torsion points on Eσ × Eτ × Eστ . Let GP = ϕ(Z) ⊂ P [2]. Consider the
quotient map πP : P −→ P/GP .
Lemma 3.7. There exists an isomorphism P/GP = Eσ × Eτ × Eστ , such that the composition πP ◦ ϕ :
Eσ × Eτ × Eστ −→ P/GP becomes the multiplication by 2. In particular, GP ' Z2 × Z2 is the set of
2-torsion points that lie in the kernel of λΞ : P → Pb.
Proof. Since |Z| = 64 and | ker ϕ| = 16 are 2-groups, we get that GP ' Z2 ×Z2 . Observe that ker(πP ◦ϕ) =

Theorem 3.8. The Prym map Prni : Rni
is injective.
2 →B

Proof. We show the statement by explicitly constructing the inverse map.
Let (P, Ξ) be a (1, 1, 4) polarised abelian threefold that is in the image of the Prym map. Note that
GP is uniquely defined as the set of 2-torsion points that are in ker λΞ and it is of cardinality 4. Consider
the quotient map π to a principally polarised threefold P/GP . Since P is in the image of the Prym map,
by Lemma 3.7, P/GP = Eσ × Eτ × Eστ with principal product polarisation so, up to permutation, the
elliptic curves are uniquely defined. For j ∈ {σ, τ, στ }, let Ej0 be the preimage of Ej via πP . Note that
Ej0 ∼
= Ej with π|Ej0 being multiplication by two.
Denote the elements of GP by 0, G0 , G1 , G∞ . Note that for each j we have that ker π = GP ⊂ Ej0 , so
GP = Ej0 [2]. Hence, there exists a unique map Ej0 −→ P1 , such that G0 , G1 , G∞ are preimages of the
branch points 0, 1, ∞ respectively and 0 is the ramification point of some bj ∈ P1 \ {0, 1, ∞}.
By Figure 1, the points bj are pairwise different from each other, so we have constructed the set of
six points in P1 with a distinguished triple. Note that renaming the points of GP gives precisely the
projective equivalence that respect the triple.
By Theorem 3.1, Lemmas 3.6 and 3.7, and Remark 3.5, it is obvious that the constructed map is the
inverse of the Prym map.

Now, we would like to understand the Prym map in terms of abelian varieties. Such characterisation
will be needed in Section 5. Let us introduce the space A1 [2](3) of non-ordered triples
((E1 , λ1 ), (E2 , λ2 ), (E3 , λ3 )),
∼

where Ei is an elliptic curve and λi : Ei [2] → V4 is an isomorphism onto the Klein group V4 , called a
level 2-structure, see [2, Section 8.3.1]. Two pairs (E1 , λ1 ) and (E2 , λ2 ) are isomorphic if there exists an
ρ
isomorphism E1 −→ E2 such that λ1 = λ2 ◦ ρ|E1 [2] . Let
D := {(E1 , λ1 ), (E2 , λ2 ), (E3 , λ3 ) | (Ei , λi ) ' (Ej , λj ), i 6= j}
and U := A1 [2](3) \ D.

Proof. Note that for every couple (Ei , λi ) ∈ A1 [2] one has a well defined map Ei → P1 ramified at the

λ−1
i (1, 1) 7→ 1

λ−1
i (1, 0) 7→ ∞,

λ−1
i (0, 0) 7→ bi .

In this way, the cross-ratio bi is uniquely determined by (Ei , λi ) and the construction gives six points
0, 1, ∞, b1 , b2 , b3 ∈ P1 with a distinguished triple. Hence, we have constructed a map Ψ : U −→ Rni
2 .
In order to define Φ, let
K := {(x, y, z) ∈ E1 [2] × E2 [2] × E3 [2] | λ1 (x) + λ2 (y) + λ3 (z) = (0, 0)}
be a subgroup and πK : E1 × E2 × E3 → E1 × E2 × E3 /K the canonical projection. Note that K is the
kernel of a surjective group homomorphism E1 [2]×E2 [2]×E3 [2] → V4 , so it has cardinality 16. Moreover,
K being contained in the set of 2-torsion points is isotropic with respect to the four times the product
polarisation. We define
Φ((E1 , λ1 ), (E2 , λ2 ), (E3 , λ3 )) = ((E1 × E2 × E3 )/K, Ξ)
where the polarisation Ξ is of type (1, 1, 4) such that ϕ∗ (Ξ) is four times the principal product polarisation
on E1 × E2 × E3 .
Observe that the group of automorphisms fv : V4 → V4 , acts on the triples {λi }i=1,2,3 by {fv ◦λi }i=1,2,3 .
This action induces projective equivalences of P1 respecting the distinguished triple and also it clearly
preserves K. Therefore, deg Ψ = deg Φ = | Aut(V4 )| = 6. The commutativity of Diagram 3.4 is a
straightforward computation.

4. Klein coverings: Isotropic case
Unlike the non-isotropic case, the lift of the hyperelliptic involution to an isotropic Klein covering
e → H is not hyperelliptic. This means that we have a few more quotient curves that are not rational.

We will use them to show that the Prym map is injective.

Proof. Let i be the hyperelliptic involution on Cτ . Since the lifts of i are either j, jτ or jσ, jστ without loss
of generality we denote them by jσ and jστ . Since | Fix(i)| = 8, we have that | Fix(jσ)|+| Fix(jστ )| = 16.
e is not hyperelliptic, we get that for any involution
Since the covering is isotropic and hence the curve C
α, | Fix(α)| < 12. Using Lemma 2.4 for jσ and jστ , we get that 4 < | Fix(jσ)| < 12 is divisible by 4 and
therefore | Fix(jσ)| = | Fix(jστ )| = 8.
Now, consider the lifts of the hyperelliptic involution ι of Cσ . By construction, again the lifts of ι are
either a pair j, jσ or jτ, jστ . Since jσ and jστ are indistinguishable, without loss of generality, we denote
the lifts from Cσ to be jτ, jστ . Repeating the argument above, we get that | Fix(jσ)| = | Fix(jστ )| =
| Fix(jτ )| = 8.

Since the fixed point sets are mutually disjoint (as different lifts of ι) and |f −1 (Fix(ι))| = 4 · 6 = 24
we get that the fourth lift, denoted by j, is fixed point free.

Remark 4.2. In the non-isotropic case, we have lifted the hyperelliptic involution from H to three
e is the unique simultaneous
hyperelliptic involutions on Cσ , Cτ , Cστ and the hyperelliptic involution on C

hyperelliptic involution from H to be three elliptic involutions on Cσ , Cτ , Cστ . Then the involution j is
the unique simultaneous lift of these three involutions.

Proposition 4.4. The curves Cσ and Cj are double coverings of Eσ branched along the same divisor.
Moreover, the curve Cj is non-hyperelliptic.
e
Proof. The first part follows from the fact that Eσ = C/hj,
σi is a quotient of both Cj and Cσ by
e
e
respective involutions, and the fact that C → Cσ and C → Cj are étale.
One can check that the double covering Cj → Eσ is defined by the line bundle OEτ σ (w1 + w2 ) ∈
Pic2 (Eσ ), where w1 , w2 are two Weierstrass points with respect to the involution τ on Eσ (like oo or zz
in Figure 2). Then, by Lemma 2.9, Cj can not be hyperelliptic.

Theorem 4.5. Every of the following data are equivalent:
(1) 3 pairs of points in P1 up to projective equivalence (respecting the pairs);
(2) a genus 2 curve H with an isotropic Klein subgroup of JH[2];
(3) a non-hyperelliptic genus 5 curve with a Klein subgroup of fixed point free involutions;
(4) a non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curve with a Z22 subgroup of automorphisms.
Proof. (1) ⇔ (2) Let (P1 , P2 ), (P3 , P4 ), (P5 , P6 ) ∈ P1 be three pairs of points in P1 . Consider the double
cover π : H −→ P1 branched in these points and let w1 , . . . , w6 , with π(wi ) = pi be the Weierstrass points
of H. By Corollary 2.7 the elements {0, w1 − w2 , w3 − w4 , w5 − w6 } ⊆ JH[2] form a Klein subgroup
and, by Remark 2.3, this subgroup is isotropic. Conversely, every genus 2 curve with an isotropic Klein
subgroup of JH[2] arises in this way.

13

(1) ⇔ (4) For each pair of points (Pi , Pj ) one can construct the elliptic curve that is a double covering of P1 branched in Pk with k ∈ {1, . . . , 6} \ {i, j}. The preimage of the pair (Pi , Pj ) becomes the
branching divisor of two double coverings, giving rise to two genus 3 curves, one hyperelliptic and one
non-hyperelliptic. These coverings are illustrated in Figure 2, by Cσ → Eσ and Cj → Eσ respectively.
By Proposition 4.4, Cj is non-hyperelliptic and it admits two commuting involutions, one arising from
the double covering Cj → Eσ and the other as the lift of the hyperelliptic involution. Conversely, by
Lemma 2.15, any non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curve Cj with a Z22 group of automorphisms is constructed as
the 4 : 1 covering of P1 with the monodromy being the Klein group, and the branching divisor are three
pairs of points, which are images of the fixed points of the three involutions.
(2) ⇔ (3) This equivalence follows from the equivalence (2) ⇔ (3) in Theorem 3.1.

Proof. The set in statement (1) can be described as the quotient of (P1 )(2) ×(P1 )(2) ×(P1 )(2) \{diagonals}
by the diagonal action of PGL(2), which is an irreducible set.

Remark 4.8. One finds a similar result to the equivalence of conditions (3) and (4) of Theorem 4.5
in [10, Proposition 3.1]. There the authors proved a bijection between some genus 5 curves with three
bielliptic involutions and genus 3 curves with three bielliptic involutions with product 1.

the curve Ejσ and the quotient map C
2(1 + jτ ) = 1 + j + τ + jτ and 2(1 + jστ ) = 1 + j + στ + jστ . Adding the equations together and having

2(1 + jσ + 1 + jτ + 1 + jστ ) = 1 + j + σ + jσ + 1 + j + τ + jτ + 1 + j + στ + jστ = 2 + 2j.

Proof. Since the restricted polarisation to the Prym variety is of type (1, 2, 2) and to the elliptic curves
is of type (2), the kernel is of cardinality 2. By definition, the restriction of ϕ to each elliptic curve is
an embedding, hence at least two of xi ’s are non-zero. Assume by contradiction (and without loss of
generality) that x1 = 0, x2 6= 0, x3 6= 0. Then ϕ(0, x2 , 0) = ϕ(0, 0, −x3 ) and hence Ejτ ∩ Ejστ 6= {0}, so
e σ ) is not an isomorphism. But Cσ is hyperelliptic, so by [16, p.
the addition map Ejτ × Ejστ −→ P (C/C
e
346] P (C/Cσ ) is polarised isogenous to the product Ejτ × Ejστ , a contradiction.

Remark 4.14. Theorem 4.12 is a more detailed version of [18, Theorem 6.3.iv] in the particular case,
when the base curve has genus 2, the coverings are étale and defined by an isotropic Klein group. This
result can also be deduced from the Kani-Rose decomposition theorem [11].
5. Characterisation of Prym varieties
In order to characterise the image of the Prym map, we need to introduce period matrices. Following
the notation in [2, 3], we denote the Siegel space hg = {Z ∈ M (g, g, C) : Z = t Z, Im Z > 0}. We denote
the imaginary part of z ∈ C by z 0 = Im(z) and by Z[i], respectively Z 0 [i], the i-th column vector of
a matrix Z, respectively its imaginary part. Let D = diag(d1 , d2 , d3 ) be a possible polarisation type2,
i.e. d1 , d2 , d3 are positive integers with d1 |d2 , d2 |d3 . If Λ is a lattice generated by the column vectors of
Z ∈ h3 and D, then we denote by AZ,D = C3 /Λ the corresponding D-polarised abelian threefold. The
D
canonical projection map from the Siegel space to the moduli space AD
g will be denoted by πD : hg → Ag .
0
If we define the alternating bilinear form on the column vectors by ω(Z [i], D[i]) = di , i = 1, 2, 3 (and
zero otherwise), then ω is the imaginary part of the hermitian form defining a polarisation of type D on
AZ,D , see [2, Section 8.1] for details. Finally, for a homomorphism f of abelian varieties we denote its
analytic representation by F .
4
We shall describe the periods matrices of the Prym varieties in Im(P ni ) ⊂ B ni ⊂ AD
with D4 =
3
ni
diag(1, 1, 4). Recall from Proposition 3.9 that the map Φ : U −→ B is given by:
Φ((E1 , λ1 ), (E2 , λ2 ), (E3 , λ3 )) = ((E1 × E2 × E3 )/K, Ξ) =: (P, Ξ),
hence it can be seen as a rational map from A1 [2](3) defined in the complement of the diagonals in
A1 [2](3) . Moreover, for each Prym variety P in the image of Prni there is an isogeny
ϕ : E1 × E2 × E3 −→ P.
Consider the following set in h3

representations of fi are given by:
ΛE1 generated by [z1 4], F1 (x) = (0, − x2 , x) ∈ C3 ,
ΛE2 generated by [z2 4], F2 (x) = ( x2 , x2 , −x) ∈ C3 ,
ΛE3 generated by [z3 4], F3 (x) = (− x2 , 0, x) ∈ C3 .
In particular, there exists a polarised isogeny f1 + f2 + f3 : E1 × E2 × E3 −→ AZ,D4 .
Proof. Since det(Z 0 ) = 41 z10 z20 z30 , we see that the imaginary parts of zi are non-zero, hence Ei are welldefined elliptic curves.
Since F1 (z1 ) = 2Z[1] + Z[3] and F1 (4) = −2D4 [2] + D4 [3] are independent primitive vectors in Λ,
we see that f1 is an embedding. Moreover, ω(2Z 0 [1] + Z 0 [3], −2D4 [2] + D4 [3]) = 4, hence the restricted
polarisation is of type (4).
Similarly, F2 (z2 ) = 2Z[1] + 2Z[2] + Z[3] and F2 (4) = 2D4 [1] + 2D4 [2] − D4 [3] shows that f2 is an
embedding and since ω(2Z 0 [1] + 2Z 0 [2] + Z 0 [3], 2D4 [1] + 2D4 [2] − D4 [3]) = 4 the restricted polarisation is
also of type (4).
Lastly, since F3 (z3 ) = 2Z[2] + Z[3] and F3 (4) = −2D4 [1] + D4 [3] are linearly independent f3 is an
embedding and one checks that the restricted polarisation is of type (4).

Lemma 5.2. Let Z ∈ Z4 be a period matrix as in Lemma 5.1. The kernel of the addition map
f1 + f2 + f3 : E1 × E2 × E3 −→ AZ,D4
is given by sixteen 2-torsion points generated by the images of the following points
{( z21 , z22 , 0), (0, z22 , z23 ), (2, 2, 0), (0, 2, 2)}.
Proof. Since some linear combinations of Fi (xi ) give the basis vectors of C3 we get that the addition
map is an isogeny. By construction, it is a polarised isogeny between a (4, 4, 4) and a (1, 1, 4) polarised
threefold, hence its degree equals 16. Now, it is enough to show that the following 2-torsion points lie
in the kernel, but this is a straightforward computation. In particular, one checks that F1 (2) + F2 (2) =
(0, 1, 0) = D4 [2] ∈ Λ, F2 (2) + F3 (2) = D4 [1] ∈ Λ and F1 ( z21 ) + F2 ( z22 ) = 2Z[1] + Z[2] + Z[3] ∈ Λ,
F2 ( z22 ) + F3 ( z23 ) = Z[1] + 2Z[2] + Z[3] ∈ Λ.

is irreducible of dimension 3. The image of the map πD4 |Z4 is the closure of the image of Prni . In
particular, we have found period matrices for the threefolds in the image of Prni .
Proof. Since the equations defining Z4 are linear and independent, Z4 is irreducible of dimension 3 and
one can choose coordinates, such that each Z ∈ Z4 is of the form satisfying Lemma 5.1.
The result follows from the commutativity of Diagram 5.1.

The isotropic case is quite similar. Let D2 = diag(1, 2, 2) and consider the locus
Z2 = {Z = (zij ) ∈ h3 : z33 = 2z31 , z32 = 0, z22 = 2z21 }.

where the first three vectors form a matrix Z ∈ Z2 . Then the abelian threefold AZ,D4 contains three
embedded elliptic curves E1 , E2 , E3 given by the following lattices and analytic representations:
ΛE1 generated by [z1 2], FE1 (x) = ( x2 , 0, 0) ∈ C3 ,
ΛE2 generated by [z2 2], FE2 (x) = ( x2 , x, 0) ∈ C3 ,
ΛE3 generated by [z3 2], FE3 (x) = ( x2 , 0, x) ∈ C3 .
Proof. Firstly, det(Z 0 ) = 21 z10 z20 z30 shows that elliptic curves are well defined. Since FE1 (z1 ) = 2Z[1] −
Z[2]−Z[3] and FE1 (2) = D2 [1] are primitive independent vectors in Λ, and ω(2Z 0 [1]−Z 0 [2]−Z 0 [3], D2 [1]) =
2, E1 is embedded in A[Z,D2 ] and the restricted polarisation is of type (2). Analogously, FE2 (z2 ) = Z[2]
and FE2 (2) = D2 [1] + D2 [2] are linearly independent in Λ as well as FE3 (z3 ) = Z[3] and FE3 (2) =
D2 [1] + D2 [3]. Then E2 are E3 are embedded in AZ,D4 and it is no difficult to check that the restricted
polarisations are both of type (2).

Lemma 5.6. The kernel of the addition map is given by {(0, 0, 0), ( z21 , z22 , z23 )}.
Proof. The analytic representation of the addition map is surjective, hence the map is an isogeny. By
construction, it is a polarised isogeny between a (2, 2, 2) and a (1, 2, 2) polarised threefold, hence it is of
degree 2. Clearly, FE1 ( z21 ) + FE2 ( z22 ) + FE3 ( z23 ) = Z[1] ∈ Λ, which proves the lemma.

In order to make computations straightforward, we do not use the characterisation of Prym as the

quotient of the Jacobian JCj , but the fact that P (C/H)
= Ejσ Ejτ Ejστ , for some elliptic curves. Let
A1,Z2 denote the moduli space of elliptic curves with a chosen non-zero 2-torsion point. Using Lemma
4.13, we define Φ : A31,Z2 −→ Priso (Riso ), by
Φ((E1 , x1 ), (E2 , x2 ), (E3 , x3 )) = E1 × E2 × E3 /{(0, 0, 0), (x1 , x2 , x3 )}

Theorem 5.8. The image of the Prym map Priso is dense in the image of the map πD2 (Z2 ).
Proof. The locus Z2 is irreducible of dimension 3 and obviously contains the image of the Prym map by
the comutativity of Diagram 5.2.

Remark 5.9. One could have defined the closure of the image of the Prym map in a different and more
ni
adapted subspace of AD
and B iso but Remark 2.21 shows that they

are reducible. Another way could be to fix the restricted polarisation types to the elliptic curves in the
following way
EbD = {(A, Ξ) ∈ AD
3 : A = E1  E2  E3 , Ξ|Ei is of type (b), for i = 1, 2, 3},
where D = (d1 , d2 , d3 ) is the polarization type and d3 |b. Unfortunately, this locus is reducible even in the
‘easiest’ case E2D2 . To see this, consider a (1, 2)-polarised abelian surface S that contains elliptic curves
E1 , E2 with restricted polarisation of type (2). Then S × E3 with a (1, 2, 2) product polarisation is an
element of E2D2 and there is a 3-dimensional family of such products. They are clearly different from
Pryms of isotropic Klein coverings.
The discrete invariant that distinguishes products from Pryms are the projections of ker(f1 +f2 +f3 ) ⊂
E1 × E2 × E3 to each elliptic curve Ei . In the Prym case, all the projections pi (ker(f1 + f2 + f3 ) ⊂ Ei
consists of two points, whereas in the product case, p3 (ker(f1 + f2 + f3 )) = {0}. The necessity of this
additional invariant also follows from [9, Section 6].
