ON THE COHOMOLOGY OF RANK TWO VECTOR BUNDLES ON P2
AND A THEOREM OF CHIANTINI AND VALABREGA.
PH. ELLIA

Abstract. We show that a normalized rank two vector bundle, E, on P2 splits if and
only if h1 (E(−1)) = 0. Using this fact we give another proof of a theorem of Chiantini
and Valabrega. Finally we describe the normalized bundles with h1 (E(−1)) ≤ 4.

1. Introduction.
We work over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. It follows from a famous
theorem of Horrocks ([9]) that a rank two vector bundle E on Pn , n ≥ 2, splits if and only
L
if H∗i (E) := k∈Z H i (E(k)) = 0, for 0 < i < n. This has been improved: as a consequence
of another famous theorem by Evans-Griffith, under the same assumptions, E splits if and
only if H∗1 (E) = 0 (see [5]). Along these lines, on P3 , there is a remarkable result:
Theorem 1. (Chiantini-Valabrega [3])
Let F be a rank two vector bundle on P3 .
(1) If c1 (F ) = 0, then F splits if and only if h1 (F (−1)) = 0.
(2) If c1 (F ) = −1, then F splits if and only if h1 (F (−1)) = 0 or h1 (F ) = 0 or h1 (F (1)) = 0.
It is natural to ask if there is a similar result on P2 and indeed there is: let E be a
normalized (i.e. −1 ≤ c1 (E) ≤ 0) rank two vector bundle on P2 , then E splits if and only
if h1 (E(−1)) = 0. Furthermore this is the best possible result. Indeed if E = Ω(1), then
h1 (E(m)) = 0, ∀m 6= −1, but E is indecomposable. Actually this result follows from a more
general fact: with notations as above, we have h1 (E(k)) ≤ h1 (E(−1)), ∀k ∈ Z (see Theorem
2). The proof of Theorem 2 is quite easy using standard vector bundles techniques. This
statement has certainly been (unconsciously) known since a long time but, as far as I know,
hasn’t been put in evidence. That’s a pity because it has some interesting consequences.
For example we show how to recover Theorem 1 from it. (For another application see [6].)
In the last section, after some general considerations, we describe rank two vector bundles
on P2 with h1 (E(−1)) ≤ 4.
2. Variations on a theorem of Chiantini and Valabrega.
Let us take some notations and recall some basic facts.

If F is a rank two vector bundle on Pn , n ≥ 2, then c1 (F (m)) = c1 (F ) + 2m and
c2 (F (m)) = c1 (F )m + c2 (F ) + m2 . A rank two vector bundle E is normalized if −1 ≤
c1 (E) ≤ 0. In this case we will denote by c1 , c2 its Chern classes.
In the sequel E will always denote a normalized rank two vector bundle with Chern classes
c1 , c2 .
The integer rE (or just r if no confusion can arise) is defined as follows r = min{k ∈ Z |
0
h (E(k)) 6= 0}. In other words r is the least twist of E having a section. Let s ∈ H 0 (E(r)).
If s does not vanish, then E ≃ O(−r) ⊕ O(r + c1 ). If s vanishes, by minimality, its zero
locus (s)0 = Z, has codimension two and we have an exact sequence: 0 → O → E(r) →
IZ (2r + c1 ) → 0. The subscheme Z is l.c.i. and deg(Z) = c2 (E(r)).
The bundle E is said to be stable if r > 0. If r ≤ 0 we will say that E is not stable (it
can be semi-stable if c1 = 0).
If E is not stable and indecomposable, then h0 (E(r)) = 1, hence Z is uniquely defined.
Finally we recall Riemann-Roch theorem: If F is a rank two vector bundle on P2 with
Chern classes c1 , c2 , then
c1 (c1 + 3)
− c2 .
χ(F ) = 2 +
2
In particular if E is a normalized rank two vector bundle on P2 with Chern classes ci , then:
(1)

χ(E(k)) =

c1
(c1 + 2k + 3) + (k + 1)(k + 2) − c2 .
2

If F is a rank two normalized vector bundle on P3 with Chern classes ci , then:

If c1 = 0 : χ(F (k)) = −c2 (k + 2) + (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)

If c1 = −1 : χ(F (k)) = (k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3) − (2k + 3)

Now we can prove the main result of this section:
Theorem 2. Let E be a rank two normalized vector bundle on P2 . Then:
(1) h1 (E(k)) ≤ h1 (E(−1)), ∀k ∈ Z.
(2) E splits if and only if h1 (E(−1)) = 0.
Proof. (1) We may assume E indecomposable. If E is not stable we have an exact sequence:
0 → O → E(r) → IZ (2r + c1 ) → 0, with r ≤ 0 and Z ⊂ P2 a non-empty zero-dimensional
subscheme. Twisting by O(−r − 1) and taking cohomology we get: h1 (E(−1)) = h1 (IZ (r −
1+c1 ). Since r−1+c1 < 0, h1 (IZ (r−1+c1 )) = h0 (OZ ) =: deg(Z). Now for any k, the exact
sequence above shows that h1 (E(k)) ≤ h1 (IZ (k + r + c1 )). Since h1 (IZ (m)) ≤ h0 (OZ ), ∀m
(consider 0 → IZ (m) → O(m) → OZ → 0), we are done.
Now assume E is stable. Let L ⊂ P2 be a general line and consider the exact sequence
0 → E(m − 1) → E(m) → EL (m) → 0. Since EL = OL ⊕ OL (c1 ) (Grauert-M´’ulich
theorem, see [9]), if m ≤ −1, h0 (EL (m)) = 0 and h1 (E(m − 1)) ≤ h1 (E(m)). It follows that
h1 (E(m)) ≤ h1 (E(−1)) if m ≤ −1. If m ≥ 0, by Serre duality h1 (E(m)) = h1 (E ∗ (−m −
3)) = h1 (E(−m − 3 − c1 )) and again h1 (E(m)) ≤ h1 (E(−1)).

(2) Of course (2) follows from (1) and Horrocks’ theorem, but let us give a simpler
argument. If E is not stable arguing as in (1), we get deg Z = 0, hence Z = ∅ and E splits.
It remains to show that h1 (E(−1)) > 0 if E is stable. By stability χ(E(−1)) = −h1 (E(−1)).
By Riemann-Roch, if h1 (E(−1)) = 0, we get c2 = 0. Now χ(E) = 2 if c1 = 0 (resp. 1 if
c1 = −1). It follows that h2 (E) > 0. But h2 (E) = h0 (E ∗ (−3)) = h0 (E(−c1 − 3)) = 0, by
stability. Hence h1 (E(−1)) 6= 0.

Remark 3. This is the best possible result in the sense that for any m 6= −1, there exists
an indecomposable rank two vector bundle, E, with h1 (E(m)) = 0: just take E = Ω(1).
Remark 4. Let’s consider an unstable rank two vector bundle, E, with c1 (E) = −1.
Arguing as above we see that h1 (E) = 0 implies that E splits.
Assume now h1 (E(1)) = 0. We have 0 → O → E(r) → IZ (2r − 1) → 0. Twisting by
O(−r + 1) we get: 0 → O(−r + 1) → E(1) → IZ (r) → 0 it follows that h1 (IZ (r)) = 0.
Now consider 0 → IZ (r) → O(r) → OZ → 0. Since r ≤ 0, the only possibility is r = 0 and
deg Z = 1. In conclusion, if E doesn’t split, we have: 0 → O → E → IP (−1) → 0, where P
is a point. Such bundles do exist.
Remark 5. One can show the following: let E be a stable, rank two vector bundle on
P2 , with c1 (E) = −1.
If h1 (E) = 0 then there exists an exact sequence: 0 → O → E(1) → IZ (1) → 0, where Z
is a set of three non collinear points. We have c2 (E) = 3.
If h1 (E(1)) = 0 then there exists an exact sequence: 0 → O → E(2) → IZ (3) → 0, where
Z is a set of six points not lying on a conic. We have c2 (E) = 4.
Let us recover Theorem 1.
Lemma 6. (1) Let F be a stable, normalized, rank two vector bundle on P3 . Then
h1 (F (−1)) 6= 0.
(2) Moreover if c1 (F ) = −1, we have h1 (F ).h1 (F (1)) 6= 0.
Proof. (1) Let H ⊂ P3 be a general plane and consider the exact sequence 0 → F (−2) →
F (−1) → FH (−1) → 0. Assume h1 (F (−1)) = 0. By Barth’s restriction theorem ([1])
h0 (FH (−1)) = 0. It follows that h1 (F (−2)) = 0 and then h1 (F (−m)) = 0, m ≥ 1. Now we
have h2 (F (−2)) = h1 (F (−c1 − 2)) = 0. This implies h1 (FH (−1)) = 0 and by Theorem 2,
FH splits. This implies that F also splits (see [9]), a contradiction. Hence h1 (F (−1)) 6= 0.
(2) Assume h1 (F ) = 0. By stability we have h3 (F ) = h0 (F (−3)) = 0. It follows that
χ(F ) = h2 (F ) ≥ 0. By Riemann-Roch we get 1 − 3c2 /2 ≥ 0. This is impossible since c2 > 0
and c2 is even.
Assume h1 (F (1)) = 0. We have h3 (F (1)) = h0 (F (−4)) = 0. It follows that χ(F (1)) ≥ 0.
By Riemann-Roch this yields: 5 − 5c2 /2 ≥ 0. Since c2 is even and c2 > 0, it follows that

c2 = 2. Stable rank two vector bundles on P3 with c1 = −1, c2 = 2 have been classified ([7])
and they all have h1 (F (1)) = 1.

Lemma 7. Let F be a non-stable, normalized, rank two vector bundle on P3 . If
h1 (F (−1)) = 0, then F splits.
Proof. Since F is not stable we have an exact sequence: 0 → O → F (r) → IC (2r +
c1 ) → 0 (∗), where r ≤ 0 and where C is either empty or a l.c.i. curve with ωC (4 −
2r − c1 ) ≃ OC (∗∗). Assume h1 (F (−1)) = 0 and C non empty. Twisting by O(−r − 1)
and taking cohomology, we get h1 (IC (r − 1 + c1 )) = 0. Since r − 1 + c1 < 0 this implies
h0 (OC (r − 1 + c1 )) = 0. It follows from (∗∗) that h0 (ωC (−r + 3)) = 0. Now consider
the exact sequence: 0 → IC (r − 2 + c1 ) → IC (r − 1 + c1 ) → IC∩H (r − 1 + c1 ) → 0,
where H is a general plane. If h2 (IC (r − 2 + c1 )) = 0, then h1 (IC∩H (r − 1 + c1 )) = 0.
Restricting (∗) to H and twisting by −r − 1, we get h1 (FH (−1)) = 0. By Theorem 2,
FH splits, hence F also splits, which contradicts the minimality of the twist r (C should
be empty). So h2 (IC (r − 2 + c1 )) = h1 (OC (r − 2 + c1 )) 6= 0. By Serre duality on C:
h1 (OC (r − 2 + c1 )) = h0 (ωC (−r + 2 − c1 )) 6= 0. But this contradicts h0 (ωC (−r + 3)) = 0.
We conclude that C is empty and that F splits.

Lemma 8. Let F be a non stable rank two vector bundle on P3 , with Chern classes
c1 = −1, c2 . If h1 (F ) = 0 or h1 (F (1)) = 0, then F splits.
Proof. Since F is not stable we have an exact sequence: 0 → O → F (r) → IC (2r − 1) → 0,
with r ≤ 0. Twisting by O(m) and taking cohomology, we see that h0 (F (m+r)) = h0 (O(m))
as long as m ≤ −2r + 1 (since then h0 (IC (m + 2r − 1)) = 0). Twisting by OH , H a general
plane, we get 0 → OH → FH (r) → IC∩H (2r − 1) → 0. Arguing as above we get that
h0 (FH (m + r)) = h0 (OH (m)) if m ≤ −2r + 1. We conclude that the exact sequence
0 → F (k − 1) → F (k) → FH (k) → 0 is exact on H 0 if k ≤ −r + 1. In particular we
have 0 → H 1 (F (k − 1)) → H 1 (F (k)), if k ≤ −r + 1. If h1 (F (t0 )) = 0 with t0 ≤ −r + 1,
then h1 (F (m)) = 0 for m ≤ t0 . So if h1 (F ).h1 (F (1)) = 0, then h1 (F (−1)) = 0. Since
h2 (F (−2)) = h1 (F (−1)), we get h1 (FH (−1)) = 0. By Theorem 2 we conclude that FH
splits, hence F also splits.


Putting every thing together we get:
Proposition 9. Theorem 2 implies Theorem 1.
Remark 10. The original proof in [3] has been worked out in the framework of subcanonical space curves.
Let us conclude this section with a last remark:

ON THE COHOMOLOGY OF RANK TWO VECTOR BUNDLES

Proposition 11. Let E be an indecomposable rank two vector bundle on P2 . Then
the module H∗1 (E) is connected (i.e. if h1 (E(t)) 6= 0 and h1 (E(m)) 6= 0 with t < m, then
h1 (E(k)) 6= 0 for t < k < m).
According to Theorem 2 this is equivalent to the following: (a) if h1 (E(−t)) = 0 for some
t ≥ 2, then h1 (E(−m)) = 0, ∀m ≥ t, and (b) if h1 (E(t)) = 0 for some t ≥ 0, then
h1 (E(m)) = 0, ∀m ≥ t.
Proof. (1) First assume E stable. Using the exact sequence 0 → E(−t − 1) → E(−t) →
EL (−t) → 0 (L ⊂ P2 a general line) and the fact that h0 (EL (−t)) = 0 if t ≥ 2 (because
EL ≃ OL ⊕ OL (c1 ), by stability), condition (a) follows immediately.
Now (b) follows from (a) by duality, indeed h1 (E(t)) = h1 (E(−t−c1 −3)) and t+3+c1 ≥ 2.
(2) Assume E non stable. Then we have an exact sequence 0 → O → E(r) → IZ (2r +
c1 ) → 0, with r ≤ 0, Z ⊂ P2 zero-dimensional. If h1 (E(t)) = 0, t ≥ 0, then h1 (IZ (2r +
c1 + t)) = 0. Since Z is zero-dimensional we have h1 (IZ (k)) = 0, ∀k ≥ 2r + c1 + t, hence
h1 (E(m)) = 0, ∀m ≥ t. This proves (b). Now (a) follows by duality: by assumption
0 = h1 (E(−t)) = h1 (E(t − c1 − 3)). Since t ≥ 2, t − c1 − 3 ≥ 0, except if c1 = 0, t = 2 but
this case cannot occur since h1 (E(−1)) = h1 (E(−2)) 6= 0 by Theorem 2. So if c1 = 0, we
may assume t ≥ 3.

Remark 12. (i) This improves Castelnuovo-Mumford’s lemma at least for the vanishing
part.
(ii) It can be shown that the H 1 -module of an indecomposable rank two vector bundle on
P3 is connected, but the proof is much more difficult, see [2].
3. Rank two vector bundles on P2 with h1 (E(−1)) ≤ 4 .
In this section we will investigate bundles with h1 (E(−1)) =: u small, say u ≤ 4. Let us
start with a useful remark:
Remark 13. Assume E indecomposable, r as usual and consider 0 → O → E(r) →
IZ (2r + c1 ) → 0, where Z ⊂ P2 , is zero-dimensional. Let 0 → L1 → L0 → IZ → 0 be the
minimal free resolution of IZ . Then we can lift the morphism L0 (2r + c1 ) → IZ (2r + c1 ) to
a morphism L0 (2r + c1 ) → E(r) and then get (after a twist) an exact sequence:
(3)

0 → L1 (r + c1 ) → O(−r) ⊕ L0 (r + c1 ) → E → 0

This gives the minimal free resolution of H∗0 (E). Now by dualizing and taking into account
that E ∗ = E(−c1 ) we get:
(4)

0 → E → O(r + c1 ) ⊕ L∗0 (−r) → L∗1 (−r) → 0

Taking cohomology we get the beginning of the minimal free resolution of the S := k[x, y, z]
module H∗1 (E):
0 → H∗0 (E) → S(r + c1 ) ⊕ L∗0 (−r) → L∗1 (−r) → H∗1 (E) → 0

6

PH. ELLIA

Then combining with (3) we get the whole resolution. By the way we notice a curious fact:
rk(S(r + c1 ) ⊕ L∗0 (−r)) = rk(L∗1 (−r)) + 2. So for a finite length graded module M , to
be the H 1 -module of a rank two vector bundle on P2 , the number of relations among its
generators must be the number of generators plus two. In fact this is not only necessary but
also sufficient (see [10] for details).
Lemma 14. Let E be a normalized rank two vector bundle on P2 . Assume E indecomposable, with h1 (E(−1)) =: u. Let r be the minimal twist of E having a section. If E
is not stable, then E(r) has a section vanishing on a zero-dimensional subscheme, Z, with
deg(Z) = u.
Proof. We have an exact sequence 0 → O → E(r) → IZ (2r + c1 ) → 0, with r ≤ 0 since
E is not stable. Twisting by O(−r + 1) and taking cohomology we get: h1 (E(−1)) =
h1 (IZ (r + c − 1 − 1) = h0 (OZ ), because r + c1 − 1 < 0 (notice that −r − 1 ≥ −1, hence
h2 (O(−r − 1)) = 0). It follows that deg(Z) = u.

Remark 15. (1) In view of this lemma and on Remark 13 if we know all the possible
minimal free resolutions of u points we get all possible resolutions of H∗0 (E). Observe that the
minimal free resolution of H∗0 (E) determines the whole cohomology of E. Indeed if we know
h0 (E(k)), ∀k ∈ Z, then by duality we know h2 (E(k)), ∀k ∈ Z. Knowing h0 (E(k)), h2 (E(k)),
we get h1 (E(k)) by Riemann-Roch.
(2) If E is non stable, indecomposable, then h0 (E(r)) = 1, hence Z = (s)0 is uniquely
defined. So we can define a map, γ, from the set of non stable bundles with h1 (E(−1)) = u
to Hilbu (P2 ), by γ(E) = Z.
Lemma 16. Let E be a stable, normalized, rank two vector bundle on P2 . We have
u := h1 (E(−1)) = c2 .
Proof. Since h0 (E(−1)) = 0 = h2 (E(−1)) = h0 (E(−c − 1 − 2)), we have χ(E(−1)) =
−h1 (E(−1)). By Riemann-Roch χ(E(−1)) = −c2 and the result follows.

Remark 17. At this point the classification, or better the description, of rank two
vector bundles E with h1 (E(−1)) = u can be split into two parts:
(1) for non stable bundles: it is enough to determine all the minimal free resolutions of l.c.i.,
zero-dimensional subschemes of degree u.
(2) classification of stables vector bundles of Chern classes −1 ≤ c1 ≤ 0 and c2 = u. In
particular we want to know the least twist having a section.
Observe that the set of non stable bundles with h1 (E(−1)) = u is some kind of counterpart
to the moduli space M(c1 , c2 ) (c2 = u) in the stable case.
Let us start with non stable bundles. To make things manageable we will assume u ≤ 4.

ON THE COHOMOLOGY OF RANK TWO VECTOR BUNDLES

Lemma 18. Let Z ⊂ P2 be a closed subscheme of codimension two, with deg(Z) = u ≤
5. There are ten possible minimal free resolutions for the ideal of Z, namely:
(a) Z is contained in a line, in this case Z is a complete intersection (1, u)
(b1) u = 3 and Z is not contained in a line, in this case:
0 → 2.O(−3) → 3.O(−2) → IZ → 0.
(b2) u = 4, h0 (IZ (1)) = 0, but Z has a subscheme of length three contained in a line. In
this case: 0 → O(−3) ⊕ O(−4) → 2.O(−2) ⊕ O(−3) → IZ → 0
(b3) u = 4 and Z is a complete intersection (2, 2).
(b4) u = 5, h0 (IZ (1)) = 0 but Z has a subscheme of length 4 contained in a line. In this
case: 0 → O(−3) ⊕ O(−5) → 2.O(−2) ⊕ O(−4) → IZ → 0
(b5) u = 5, h0 (IZ (2)) = 1. In this case:
0 → 2.O(−4) → 2.O(−3) ⊕ O(−2) → IZ → 0

Proof. Well known.



As explained before this gives us all the possible resolutions (hence all the possible cohomologies) of non stable, indecomposable bundles with h1 (E(−1)) ≤ 4. We need u = 5 for
the stable case:
Proposition 19. Let E be a stable, normalized, rank two vector bundle on P2 , with
h (E(−1)) = u ≤ 4. As usual let r denote the minimal twist of E having a section. Then
r = 1 or r = 2, c1 = −1, u = 4. Moreover:
(1) If c1 = 0 we have u ≥ 2 and E(1) has a section vanishing on a subscheme of degree u + 1
which is not contained in a line.
(2) If c1 = −1 and r = 1, we have u ≥ 1 and E(1) has a section vanishing on a subscheme
of length u. If r = 2, u = 4, then E(2) has a section vanishing on a degree 6 subscheme, Z,
with h0 (IZ (2)) = 0.
1

Proof. In any case h2 (E(1)) = h0 (E(−c1 − 4)) = 0 by stability. Since χ(E(1)) = 6 − c2 if
c1 = 0 (resp. 4 − c2 if c1 = −1) and since c2 = u (Lemma 16), we get χ(E(1)) > 0, except
if c1 = −1, u = 4. In this case we have h0 (E(1)) = h1 (E(1)). Assume h0 (E(1)) = 0. Since
χ(E(2)) = 9−c2, we have h0 (E(2)) > 0 and an exact sequence 0 → O → E(2) → IZ (3) → 0,
where deg(Z) = c2 (E(2)) = 6. We have h0 (E(1)) = 0 = h0 (IZ (2)). This proves the first
claim.
(1) Assume c1 = 0. We have 0 → O → E(1) → IZ (2) → 0. By stability h0 (IZ (1)) = 0. In
particular degZ = c2 + 1 ≥ 3, i.e. u = c2 ≥ 2.
(2) Assume now c1 = −1. Since c2 (E(1)) = c2 = u, if r = 1, we have 0 → O → E(1) →
IZ (1) → 0, with Z of degree u. If u = 4 and h0 (E(1)) = 0, a section of E(2) vanishes along
Z of degree 6 with h0 (E(1)) = 0 = h0 (IZ (2)).

Remark 20. (1) By Serre’s construction for any k ≤ 2 and any locally complete
intersection, zero-dimensional subscheme Z ⊂ P2 there exists a rank two vector bundle, F ,

8

with c1 (F ) = k, and an exact sequence 0 → O → F → IZ (k) → 0. If k ≤ 0 this is the
least twist of F having a section and F is not stable. In particular all the bundles we have
considered in Proposition 19 do really exist !
(2) We have the list of all possible resolutions for H∗0 (E), where E is a normalized bundle with
h1 (E(−1)) ≤ 4. Indeed the only case not covered by Lemma is when r = 2, but a subscheme,
Z, of degree 6, not on a conic has a resolution like: 0 → 3.O(−4) → 4.O(−3) → IZ → 0.
(2) We observe that if u = 1 we always have that E(r) has a section vanishing at one
point. More precisely:
Corollary 21. Let E be a normalized, indecomposable, rank two vector bundle on P2 .
Let r denote the minimal twist of E having a section.
(1) The following are equivalent:
(i) h1 (E(m)) ≤ 1, ∀m ∈ Z
(ii) h1 (E(−1)) = 1
(iii) E(r) has a section vanishing at one point
(iv) there is an exact sequence:
0 → O(−b − 1) → O(−a) ⊕ 2.O(−b) → E → 0
with a ≤ b (in particular a = r, b = −r − c1 + 1).
(2) A bundle like in (1) is stable if and only if a = b, if and only if E = Ω(1).
Proof. (i) ⇔ (ii), since E is indecomposable, this follows from Theorem 2.
(ii) ⇒ (iii): If E is non stable this follows from Lemma 14. If E is stable this follows from
Proposition 19. More precisely we have c2 = 1 (Lemma 16) and r = 1, c1 = −1 (Proposition
19).
(iii) ⇒ (iv): This follows from Remark 13.
(iv) ⇒ (i): Since a ≤ b, r = a, hence a section of E(a) will vanish in codimension two. Since
c1 = −r − b + 1, we get b = −r − c1 + 1, c1 (E(a)) = a − b + 1. We get a commutative
diagram:

0 →
0 →

O(a − b − 1) →

So we get 0 → O(−2) → 2.O(−1) → IZ → 0 and we conclude that Z is a point p. Since
h1 (Ip (m)) is 0 if m ≥ 0 and 1 if m < 0, we conclude that h1 (E(k)) ≤ 1, ∀k ∈ Z.
(2) We have already seen ((ii) ⇒ (iii)) that E is stable if and only if c2 = r = 1, c1 = −1.

Hence we have 0 → O(−1) → 3.O → E(1) → 0. It follows that E(1) = T (−1) = Ω(2). On
the other hand if r = a = b = −r − c1 + 1, then c1 = −1 and r = 1, in particular E is
stable.

Remark 22. This result is known in the context of logarithmic bundles, see [4], [8]
In the same vein we have:
Corollary 23. Let E be a normalized, indecomposable, rank two vector bundle on P2 .
Let r denote the minimal twist of E having a section. The following are equivalent:
(i) h1 (E(−1)) = 2
(ii) E(r) has a section vanishing along a subscheme of degree two, or E is stable with
c1 = 0, c2 = 2, r = 1 and E(1) has a section vanishing along a subscheme of degree three
not contained in a line.
(iii) there is an exact sequence:
0 → O(−b − 2) → O(−b − 1) ⊕ O(−b) ⊕ O(−a) → E → 0
with a ≤ b (in particular a = r, b = −r − c1 + 1), or:
0 → 2.O(−2) → 4.O(−1) → E → 0.
Proof. It is similar to the previous one, so we omit it.
