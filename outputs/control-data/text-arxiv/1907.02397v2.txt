Abstract
In this work, we reported the observation of a novel planar topological Hall effect (PTHE) in
single crystal of Fe3GeTe2, a paradigmatic two-dimensional ferromagnet with strong uniaxial
anisotropy. The Hall effect and magnetoresistance varied periodically when the external magnetic
field rotated in the ac (or bc) plane, while the PTHE emerged and maintained robust with field
swept across the hard-magnetized ab plane. The PTHE covers the whole temperature region below
Tc (~150 K) and a comparatively large value of 2.04  cm is observed at 100 K. Emergence of
an internal gauge field was proposed to explain the origin of this large PTHE, which is either
generated by the possible topological domain structure of uniaxial Fe3GeTe2 or the non-coplanar
spin structure formed during the in-plane magnetization. Our results promisingly provide an
alternative detection method to the in-plane skyrmion formation and may bring brand-new
prospective to magneto-transport studies in condensed matter physics.

Emergent electromagnetism1 induced by the internal gauge field has triggered many novel
and interesting transport phenomena, for instance, the unusual large anomalous Hall effect (AHE)
in non-collinear antiferromagnets2-4 or contributed by topological Weyl or nodal line band
structure5,6. On the other hand, topological Hall effect (THE) is also uncovered in systems with
scalar spin chirality7,8 or topological-nontrivial spin texture9-11 (skyrmions, typically). These
Berry-phase driven phenomena have deeply enriched our understanding of the fundamental
physics of magneto transport, especially the Hall effect, as well as offer versatile options to
spintronic applications3,6.
A regular Hall effect is measured during the applied magnetic field (H), the electrical current
(I) and the measured voltage (V) are mutually vertical. There exists a so-called planar Hall effect
(PHE)12, where the Hall signal is otherwise obtained in the plane parallel to H. PHE is resulted by
neither of the mechanism account for AHE, but actually relates to the anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR)13,14. Giant PHE has been reported in the ferromagnetic semiconductor
films15 and recently in the topological Weyl semimetal that correlates with chiral-anomaly16,17.
However, the nature of PHE makes it exhibit symmetric curves while sweeping H, as observed in
most cases15,18, rather than antisymmetric one like a normal Hall effect. In addition, the transverse
voltage will vanish when I is perpendicular or parallel to H according to its phenomenological
expression (will be discussed later). But there are several works reported the AHE-like signal in a
PHE configuration19,20, which are currently explained by either a high-order contribution or
non-collinear spin structure.
Here we identified a novel planar topological Hall effect (PTHE) in a quasi-two-dimensional
van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe221. The signal of THE gradually emerges when H rotated
away from its usual perpendicular direction, and reaches the maximum when H located in the
same ab plane where the Hall signal is measured. So, we named it as PTHE, to distinguish from
the existed THE observed in a normal three-axis configuration. It should be noted that Yihao
Wang et al22 have already reported similar-shape THE in Fe3GeTe2, but the conventional
configuration is applied there, making it distinct from the phenomenon observed here. The PTHE
was proposed to be originated from the emergent gauge field that associate with the possible
topological or chiral spin texture of Fe3GeTe2. Our results can potentially provide an effective
method to detect the in-plane topological spin texture, particular in 2D system and thin films, and

further extend the understanding of the Hall effect and may bring new prospective to
magneto-transport studies in condensed matter physics.
High-quality single crystal samples were grown through the self-flux method from a mixture of
pure elements Fe (99.8%), Ge (99.9999%) and Te (99.99%) with a composition of Fe2GeTe423. The
mixture was then sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and heated to 960 . The melt was held at
960

for 12h, then cooled slowly to 675

with a rate of 3 /h, and finally cooled down to room

temperature. Typical size of the single crystals is ~ 2  2 0.1mm, with cleavable layer in the ab
plane. The crystal structure was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Brucker D8 Advance) with
Cu-K radiation. Element composition and atomic configuration were examined by
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in the scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta 250F)
and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, JEOL ARM200F),
respectively. The atomic ratio determined by EDS is ~ 3: 1: 2.2, exhibiting slightly
off-stoichiometric, which may account for the lowering Curie temperature of our samples
comparing to the ones grown by the chemical vapor transport (CVT)24-26. Magnetization and
transport properties were measured in the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
and physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design) respectively. For transport
measurements, the samples were cut into regular rectangle shape and a six-probe method is
applied to simultaneously measure the magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall resistivity. The final MR
and Hall data were symmetrized to exclude the misalignment of the electrode.
Fe3GeTe2 is a van der Waals ferromagnet that crystallizes in space group P63/mmc with a
layered Fe3Ge substructure sandwiched by two Te layers21. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the Fe3Ge
substructure contains two inequivalent FeI and FeII atoms, contributing to a FeII-Ge hexagonal
atomic ring layer and two separated triangular lattice FeI-FeI layer. The hexagonal ring was clearly
resolved in the high-resolution STEM image in Fig. 1(b), which also confirmed the stacked
structure and high quality of our samples. Typical XRD pattern of the as-grown sample in Fig. 1(c)
verified the expected single-crystalline nature, with all the reflections along the crystallographic
orientation [001].
The temperature dependence of magnetization under zero-field-cooled (ZFC), field-cooled
(FC) and field-warming (FW) are measured with

to the c axis, as seen in Fig. 1(d). A ferromagnetic transition is observed at approximately 150K

and the difference in magnitude for the two directions indicates the anisotropic character of the
low temperature magnetic phase. A slight kink at about 125K below

was also observed,

consistent with the possible two-stage magnetic ordering transition26. The magnetization curve at
5K for both H//c and H//ab direction distinctly demonstrates the strong magneto-crystalline
anisotropy in Fe3GeTe2 with the easy axis along the c direction. The saturated magnetic moment
for H//c, also consistent with the reported values21-23.

The magneto-transport properties for H perpendicular to the current plane have been
previously investigated6,22, and a large anomalous Hall current has been identified in the ab plane
owing to the topological nodal line band structure6. In this work, firstly we measured

c-axis to the ab plane, as shown in the middle scheme of Fig. 2. We define the angle between the
external magnetic field and the normal of the sample plane as

shown in Fig. 2(a). It becomes most distinct for

name of PTHE is given. At this configuration, the contribution of the AHE is almost completely
excluded. Simultaneously, clear bend at the same filed where PTHE emerges is observed in the
MR curves in Fig. 2(b). We proposed that this in-plane Hall and MR anomaly could be resulted by
an internal field the pointed in the perpendicular direction, which will be elaborated later.

component at

which are caused by the misalignment error. It is noted here only at

as observed in several other samples (supplementary Fig. S231). The MR showed two-fold pattern
peaking around 90 (270), with anisotropy of ~ -0.5% (

Furthermore, to establish a clearer picture of this abnormal PTHE, we measured the in-plane

Figs. 3(a, b). The cusp in

instead of antisymmetric one like a conventional Hall effect15,18. There are some examples where
small AHE-like signal is observed19,20, which are currently explained by a high-order contribution
or non-collinear spin structure. But the large presence of PTHE is a phenomenon that first
identified. Since there is no external perpendicular component of magnetic field in this
configuration, we refer to possible the internal gauge field that account for the extra enhancement
of

. On one hand, we notice that the topological (bubble-like) domain structure in the ab plane

of Fe3GeTe2 has been suspected by the previous MFM and STM measurements36,37. The possible
in-plane topological spin-texture can give rise to a so-called emergent field38, which is represented
with h in the schematic inset of Fig. 3(a). The h behaves just like the real magnetic field to deflect
the electrons, thus resulting in the observed Hall signal. Notably, the almost completely exclusion
of AHE in the original PTHE makes it an efficient detection method of in-plane skyrmion
formation39. On the other hand, non-vanishing spin chirality associated with non-coplanar spin
structure can induce similar gauge field [1, 22]. As proved by our experiments as well as the
literatures [22,24], Fe3GeTe2 is a strong uniaxial magnet with easy axis along the c direction
(out-of-plane), and meanwhile the Fe atom form a rather frustrated triangular structure (as seen in
Fig. 1). Hence during the in-plane magnetization process, the spins of Fe atoms could form a
non-coplanar structure that contribute to the h (also schematically shown in inset of Fig. 3(a)),
where further evidence is still needed. These are the two possibilities that can generate an internal
field to arouse PTHE in our sample.
In summary, by three-dimensional rotation of the magnetic field with respect to the sample
6

plane, we have observed a large planar topological Hall effect in the hard-magnetized but
easily-cleavable ab plane in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. Systematic studies on the
angular dependence revealed the dynamical evolution of the Hall resistivity and MR which are
invariantly measured in the ab plane. The PTHE exists in the whole temperature region below
and reaches the maximum value of 2.04

at 1.2T at 100K, which is much larger than

those observed in most skyrmion systems. We attribute the origin of this large PTHE to the
emergence of a gauge field, which is either generated by the possible topological domain structure
of uniaxial Fe3GeTe2 or the non-coplanar spin structure formed in the process of in-plane
magnetization. It should be mentioned that, during the submission of this manuscript, the
observation of the topological skyrmion crystal in the ab plane has just beenis reported on the
arXiv by T. E. Park et al40, which strongly support one of our presumptions. Therefore, PTHE can
be a prominent sensitive way method to detect in-plane skyrmion formation, practically in the
natural two-dimensional system and thin films, where the Hall effect on other sides are hardly
accessible.
