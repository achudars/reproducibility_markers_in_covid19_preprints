ORBITAL STABILITY OF STANDING WAVES FOR
FRACTIONAL HARTREE EQUATION WITH UNBOUNDED
POTENTIALS
JIAN ZHANG, SHIJUN ZHENG, AND SHIHUI ZHU
Abstract. We prove theR existence of the set of ground states in a suitable
energy space Σs = {u : RN ū(−∆ + m2 )s u + V |u|2 < ∞}, s ∈ (0, N
) for
2
the mass-subcritical nonlinear fractional Hartree equation with unbounded
potentials. As a consequence we obtain, as a priori result, the orbital stability
of the set of standing waves. The main ingredient is the observation that Σs
is compactly embedded in L2 . This enables us to apply the concentration
compactness argument in the works of Cazenave-Lions and Zhang, namely,
relative compactness for any minimizing sequence in the energy space.

1. Introduction
Consider the nonlinear fractional Hartree equation with an unbounded potential
in the following form: For 0 < s < N/2 and (t, x) ∈ R1+N

iut = (−∆ + m2 )s u + V (x)u − ( γ ∗ |u|2 )u
(1.1)
|x|
(1.2)
u(0, x) = u0 ∈ Σs ,

where u = u(t, x): R × RN → C is a complex
valued function and the convolution

∗ is defined by W ∗ |u| := |·|γ ∗ |u| (x) = |x−y|γ dy with 0 < γ < min{4s, N }.
The operator (−∆ + m2 )s is defined by

(−∆ + m2 )s u = F −1 [(|ξ|2 + m2 )s F [u](ξ)],

where m ≥ 0, F and F −1 are the Fourier transform and the inverse in RN , respectively. Here the potential function V ∈ C ∞ (RN ) is bounded from below V (x) ≥ −c0
for some c0 > 0 and satisfies
(1.3)

V (x) → ∞ as |x| → ∞.

Such class of V includes unbounded potentials arising in physics, for instance, the
harmonic potential V (x) = |x|2 , and more generally, polynomial functions that are
bounded from below. Then Hs,V := (−∆ + m2 )s + V is essentially self-adjoint in
the Hilbert space Σs := {v ∈ L2 : (−∆ + m2 )s/2 v ∈ L2 and |V |1/2 v ∈ L2 }, as is
given in Section 2.
The Hartree equation is non-integrable analog of the NLS system, which arises
naturally in large quantum systems that describe the wave motion for the bosonic
or fermionic particles. When s = 1, it can be derived from the mean-field limit of
N -body GPE hierarchy, where W (x) = |x|−γ represents the long-range two-body

interaction potential. A special feature of the Hartree equation lies in the convolution kernel W that preserves the fine structure of micro two-body interactions
of particles. This is in contrast to the NLS, which can be viewed as the limiting
case W → δ and where the two-body interactions are modeled from the scattering
length. When s = 12 , (1.1) arises as an effective description of pseudo-relativistic
boson stars in the mean field limit, where u(t, x) is a complex-valued wave field.
The study of such a perturbed system in the presence of external potential V is
both physically and mathematically very important.
When V is zero or bounded, the dynamical properties of solutions for the fractional Hartree equation (1.1) have been considered in e.g., [16, 8, 13, 1, 24, 7, 12, 25].
In [24, 7], the authors studied the orbital stability for standing wave solutions,
that is, ground states (the set of minimizers) for (1.1) with zero potential by profile decomposition method. Furthermore, [24] showed the strong instability in the
mass-critical case. The analogous results on orbital stability for nonlinear fractional
Schrödinger equation (FNLS) were obtained in [5, 11, 26]. The paper [5] studied
the FNLS with power nonlinearity and a decaying potential, while [11, 26] studied
FNLS with power nonlinearity in the form |u|p−1 u + |u|q−1 u.
In this paper, we are concerned with the orbital stability of standing wave solutions for (1.1) in the mass-subcritical regime γ < 2s. Note that when V = 0, γ = 2s
corresponds to the mass-critical case and γ = 4s corresponds to the energy-critical
case by scaling invariance argument. The presence of an unbounded V brings in
technical difficulties and the methods in [5, 11, 24] do not directly apply to (1.1).
Motivated by the treatment for the classical NLS in [22, 23], we prove a new compactness lemma in Section 3, adapted to the energy space for (1.1), which leads
to the solution to the variational problem 4.1 in Proposition 4.1. Thus follows the
main result Theorem 4.3. The proof in Section 4 can be viewed as an adaption to
the potential case, also see [3, 2] for the original treatment of NLS type equations
via variational method.
2. Preliminaries
q

We will use the notations L := Lq (RN ), k · kq := k · kLq (RN ) , H s := H s (RN ) and
Ḣ s := Ḣ s (RN ), the latter two denoting the usual Sobolev space and its homogeneous version. The various positive constants will be simply denoted by C. From
now on throughout the paper, without loss of generality we may assume there is
some positive constant c1 such that for all x,
(2.1)

V (x) ≥ c1 > 0 and

V (x) → ∞ as |x| → ∞.

If otherwise, the lower bound of V is −c0 < 0, then one can always apply the
substitution u → eitC u for any C ≥ c0 + c1 to convert equation (1.1) into one with
V bounded from below by a positive constant; see also Remark 4.4.
For V satisfying (2.1) define the energy space Σs as

From the Hardy inequality (3.1), the functional E(v) is well-defined in Σs . Note
that if V = 0 and m = 0, γ = 4s < N corresponds to the energy-critical case due to
1
u( λt2s , λx ) leaves invariant the energy and the solution
that the scaling u 7→ λ(N −2s)/2

1
u( λt2s , λx ) leaves invariant the mass M (u) := |u|2 and (1.1).
the scaling u 7→ λN/2
In this paper, we assume that the Cauchy problem (1.1)-(1.2) is well-posed in Σs ,
namely, the following global in time existence, uniqueness and conservation laws
hold in the mass-subcritical regime γ < 2s.
Hypothesis 1. Let N ≥ 1 and γ2 < s < N/2. If the initial data u0 ∈ Σs , then there
exists a unique
T solution u(t, x) of the Cauchy problem (1.1)-(1.2) on R such that
u ∈ C(R; Σs ) C 1 (R; H −s ). Moreover, for all t ∈ R, u(t, x) satisfies the following
conservation laws:
(i) (mass)
M (u(t)) = M (u0 ).
(ii) (energy)
E(u(t)) = E(u0 ).
Remark 2.1. For local well-posedness in the above conjectured proposition, so far
we only know about numerical result on cubic FNLS with a quadratic potential by
Zhang and Kirkpatrick [15], where is suggested the long-time existence along with
its dynamics for some special initial data. The theoretical proof has remained an
open question concerning FNLS and Hartree equations with harmonic potentials.
The main difficulty is the lack of proper dispersive or Strichartz estimates because
the fractional Laplacian for 0 < s < 1 does not hold a control over the harmonic
potential, which is shown in the deformed trajectories for the associated hamiltonian, see [15] and [19]. This is in sharp contrast to the classical NLS (s = 1) with
a harmonic potential, where the existence and stability problem has been studied
quite extensively [9, 10, 18, 22, 23, 14, 6].
Heuristically the Laplacian −∆ and V = |x|2 have balanced strength or effect so
the L1 → L∞ time decay t−N/2 holds locally for eit(∆−V ) . However, for 0 < s < 1,
in the phase space the bound energy for fractional laplacian (−∆ + m2 )s is less
than |x|2 , or, Hs,0 relative to V is like the laplacian vs. anharmonic potential of
higher order. It falls within the quantum situation “a particle at a higher altitude

falls down to the bottom of the potential in a shorter time than one at a lower
altitude”, which obstructs Fujiwara’s theorem, cf. [17].
3. Proof of main result
For estimating the Hartree nonlinearity we will need Hardy’s inequality, see e.g,
[20]: If s ∈ (0, N/2)

In the last step of the above, we have employed (3.1). Thus, (3.2) follows from (3.3)
and (3.4).

Lemma 3.2. Let 0 < γ < 2s, 0 < s < N/2 and V satisfy (2.1). Suppose {vn }∞
n=1
converges weakly to U in Σs . Then there exists a subsequence (still denoted by
{vn }) such that
kvn k22 → kU k22

n → ∞.

Remark 3.3. Equation (3.5) indeed implies that for s > 0, Σs is compactly embedded in L2 .
Proof. Since Σs ⊂ L2 , it is easy to see that for U ∈ Σs ∩ L2 , vn ⇀ U weakly in Σs
and
(3.7)

vn ⇀ U weakly in

L2

as n → ∞. For an elementary proof of (3.7), see Proposition 5.1 in the Appendix.
Since {vn } is weakly convergent in Σs , kvn kΣs is uniformly bounded. So there
is a positive constant K such that
Z
(3.8)
sup V (x)|vn (x)|2 dx ≤ sup kvn k2Σs < K.

Furthermore, we will show that there is a subsequence of {vn } that strongly converges in L2 and satisfies (3.6).
(1) First, we consider the case where U = 0. From (3.8) with V satisfying (2.1),
we have for arbitray ǫ > 0, there exists a constant B = Bǫ > 0 (large enough) such
1
that V (x)
≤ ǫ when |x| > B. We see that
Z

|x|>B

|vn |2 dx =

For the fixed B, compact embedding property for Sobolev space on bounded domain
gives that one can extract a subsequence (still denoted by {vn }) such that
strongly in L2 ({|x| ≤ B}).
R
Hence, there exists L = Lǫ such that for all n > L, |x|≤B |vn |2 dx ≤ ǫ. Thus, we
have, if n > L,

|x|>B

Now, taking ǫ = ǫk → 0 as k → ∞, a standard diagonal argument shows that there
exists a subsequence of {vn }, still denoted by {vn }, such that (3.5) is true in the
case U = 0. Then, it follows from (3.2) in Lemma 3.1 that

|vn (x)|2 |vn (y)|2

kvn k2 s → 0 as n → ∞.
dxdy ≤ Ckvn kḢ

This proves (3.6) when U = 0.
(2) Secondly, we consider the case U 6= 0. Take wn = vn − U . We have wn ⇀ 0
weakly in Σs and in L2 as n → ∞. Then, from the above discussion, we see that
there is a subsequence (still denoted by {wn }) such that wn → 0 strongly in L2 . In
other words, we have
(3.11)

kvn − U k2 → 0 as n → ∞.

To prove (3.6), we will apply (3.4). Indeed, if 0 < γ < 2s, we deduce that

Therefore, (3.6) is true for U 6= 0, which completes the proof.

4. Orbital stability of standing waves
Given 0 < γ < 2s, s ∈ (0, N/2), N ≥ 1, let m ≥ 0 and M > 0. Consider the
following variational problem
(4.1)

dM :=

inf

E(v),

{v∈Σs kvk22 =M}

RR |v(x)|2 |v(y)|2
dxdy, as defined in (2.4). The following
where E(v) = 12 kvk2Σs − 14
|x−y|γ
proposition constructs a minimizer, called ground state, to the problem (4.1).
Proposition 4.1. Let M > 0. Suppose 0 < γ < 2s and V satisfies (2.1), then the
infimum in the variational problem can be attained. That is, there exists U ∈ Σs
such that
(4.2)

E(U ) = dM =

min
{v∈Σs

E(v).

kvk22 =M}

Moreover, any minimizing sequence to (4.1) must be relatively compact in Σs .
Proof. Firstly, we prove the variational problem (4.1) is well-defined. That is, E(v)
has a lower bound in {v ∈ Σs kvk22 = M }. From Lemma 3.1, we deduce that

′
In the last step, we have used the elementary inequality 21 X − CM
X γ/2s ≥ −CM
′
for all X > 0 and some constants CM , CM > 0. Thus, E(v) is bounded from below
and the infimum dM exists.
Secondly, take any minimizing sequence {vn } of Problem (4.1) satisfying

(4.4)

E(vn ) → dM

and kvn k22 → M,

as n → ∞.

We see that there exists an L such that for all n ≥ L,
(4.5)

E(vn ) < dM + 1.

This, together with (4.3) implies for all n ≥ L,

1
γ/s
kvn k2Σs ≤ CM kvn kḢ s + dM + 1.
2
Hence, {vn } must be bounded in Σs by virtue of the condition γs < 2.
Thirdly, from the boundedness of {vn }, we know there exists a subsequence (still
denoted by {vn }) and U ∈ Σs such that
(4.6)

(4.7)

vn (x) ⇀ U (x) weakly in

Σs .

By the lower semi-continuity of norm Σs , we have
(4.8)

kU k2Σs ≤ lim inf kvn k2Σs .
n→∞

Combining (4.8), Lemma 3.2 and (4.4) we obtain that kvn k22 → kU k22 = M and
E(U ) ≤ lim inf E(vn ) = dM .
n→∞

ORBITAL STABILITY FOR FRACTIONAL HARTREE EQUATION

7

But from the definition of dM , we must have E(U ) = dM . That is, U is a minimizer
of (4.1). To prove the statement on relative compactness, observe that the last
argument shows
E(U ) = lim E(vn ).
n→∞

This, along with Lemma 3.2 implies there exists a subsequence {vnk } such that
limk→∞ kvnk kΣs = kU kΣs . Therefore, in view of (4.7), the strong convergence
vnk → U in Σs follows.

Remark 4.2. The existence of ground states for FNLS with unbounded V was
obtained in [4] via Nehari’s manifold approach. The existence and symmetry of
ground state solutions were studied in [21] for Hartree equation with zero potential.
Define the set
(4.9)

SM := {v ∈ Σs v is the minimizer of Problem (4.1) }.

From the Euler-Lagrange Theorem (see [2]), for any v ∈ SM ⊂ Σs , there exists
ω ∈ R such that
1
(4.10)
(−△ + m2 )s v + V (x)v + ωv − ( γ ∗ |v|2 )v = 0.
|x|

Moreover, u(t, x) = eiωt v(x) is a standing wave solution for (1.1). Thus, each
v in SM is called an orbit. It is easy to check that for any t > 0, if v ∈ SM ,
then eiωt v(x) ∈ SM . Applying Proposition 4.1, we now prove the following orbital
stability for (1.1). More precisely, assuming Hypothesis 1, we show that if the initial
data is close to an orbit v ∈ SM , then the solution of evolution system (1.1)-(1.2)
remains close to SM , the set of ground states, for all time.

Theorem 4.3 (orbital stability of standing waves). Let M > 0 and V satisfy (2.1).
Let 0 < s < N/2 and 0 < γ < 2s. Then, for arbitrary ε > 0, there exists δ > 0
such that if the initial data u0 in Σs satisfies
(4.11)

inf ku0 − vkΣs < δ,

v∈SM

it holds for the solution u of the Cauchy problem (1.1)-(1.2),
(4.12)

inf ku(t, x) − v(x)kΣs < ε

v∈SM

for all t, where SM is defined in (4.9).
Proof. We prove the theorem by contradiction following the standard method for
NLS (see [2, 22, 23]). Let u0 ∈ Σs and u be the unique solution for (1.1). From the
proof of Proposition 4.1 and the conservation laws in Hypothesis 1, we obtain that
for all t,
1
γ/s
ku(t, ·)k2Σs ≤ E(u0 ) + C(ku0 k2 )ku(t, ·)kΣs .
2
This suggests that the Σs -norm of u is uniformly bounded for all t.
Assume that the conclusion in the theorem is false, then there exist ε0 > 0 and
a sequence of initial data {u0,n }∞
n=1 such that
(4.13)

inf ku0,n − vkΣs <

v∈SM

1
,
n

8

JIAN ZHANG, SHIJUN ZHENG, AND SHIHUI ZHU

and there exists a sequence of time {tn }∞
n=1 such that for all n,
(4.14)

inf kun (tn , x) − vkΣs ≥ ε0 .

v∈SM

But from (4.13), the conservation laws and Lemma 3.2, it follows that there exist
w ∈ Σs and a subsequence of {un } (still denoted by {un }) such that as n → ∞
kun (tn , x)k22 = ku0,n k22 → kwk22 = M
and
{un (tn , ·)}∞
n=1

E(un (tn , x)) = E(u0,n ) → E(w) = dM .

Hence,
is a minimizing sequence of (4.1). According to Proposition
4.1, w ∈ SM is a minimizer such that, when passing to a subsequence if necessary,
(4.15)

kun (tn , x) − w(x)kΣs → 0 as n → ∞.

This contradicts (4.14), which proves the theorem.



Remark 4.4. The results in Theorem 4.3 and Proposition 4.1 continue to hold if V
satisfies the slightly more general condition (1.3). To see this, it suffices to observe
RR |u(x)|2 |u(y)|2
dxdy be
the following properties. Let EV (u) := E(u) = 12 kuk2Σs − 41
|x−y|γ
given as in (2.4) and ΣsV := Σs as in (2.2). Let C ≥ c0 + c1 be a fixed constant.
Then we have:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)

M (eiθ u) = M (u)
EV (eiθ u) = EV (u)
eiθ SM = SM
EV +C (u) = EV (u) + C2 M (u)
The set of minimizers SM is independent of V + C
Denote by uV the solution of (1.1)-(1.2), then we have uV +C (t, x) = e−itC uV (t, x).

Remark 4.5. The case s = 1, γ = 2 (mass-critical) was studied in [14], where the
threshold for the stability of standing waves for (1.1) are obtained. Earlier result
on the l.w.p. and mass and energy conservation laws for (1.1) can be found in [2]
for s = 1, and γ ≤ 2. Let Q0 be the unique radial positive ground state solution
of (4.1), where V = 0. The paper [14, Theorem 4.1] followed a quite standard
variational approach and proved that if s = 1, γ = 2 and M < kQ0 k22 , then there
exist ground state solutions of the minimization problem (4.1), where V = |x|2 .
Moreover, these ground state solutions are orbitally stable.
In the absence of V , when γ = 2s (0 < s < 1 and N ≥ 2), Zhang and Zhu [24]
proved the orbital stability via profile decomposition method. They also showed
strong instability of (1.1) by constructing blowup solutions with initial data arbitrarily close to Q0 in H s .
5. Appendix: Uniqueness of weak convergence
For the proof of Lemma 3.2 we need the following.
Proposition 5.1. Let s > 0 and Σs ⊂ L2 be defined as in (2.2) with V satisfying
(2.1). Let {vn } be a sequence in Σs . If {vn } converges weakly to f in Σs and {vn }
converges weakly to g in L2 . Then f is identical to g in Σs ∩ L2 .

The domain of H = Hs,V is given by
D(H) = {φ ∈ L2 : (−∆ + m2 )s φ ∈ L2 , V φ ∈ L2 }.
It is easy to verify that D(H) is a complete Hilbert subspace of L2 with respect to
the norm
1/2
.
kφkD(H) := k(−∆ + m2 )s φk22 + kV φk22
The form domain of H is defined as: v ∈ Q(H) ⇐⇒ v ∈ L2 (RN ) and
(−∆ + m2 )s/2 v ∈ L2

and V 1/2 v ∈ L2 ,
p
which is complete with respect to the norm q(v, v) = kvkΣs given in (2.3). We
have D(H) ⊂ Q(H). The form definition for H is equivalent to the following weak
form definition.
√
Definition 5.2. A function f ∈ Σs = H s ∩ D( V ) is in Q(H) if and only if for
all φ ∈ H s (RN ), there exists an h ∈ L2 ∩ H −s s.t.

We see that Q(H) = D(H) = H 2s ∩ D(V ). Since on D(H) it holds
h(−∆ + m2 )s φ, φi + hV φ, φi ≥ (m2s + c1 )hφ, φi,
we obtain that the spectrum σ(H) ⊂ [c1 , ∞), which implies 0 is in the resolvent
set for H. Hence H −1 = (H − 0)−1 : L2 → D(H) ⊂ Σs exists and is a continuous
mapping.
Proof of Proposition 5.1. For all φ ∈ D(H) ⊂ Σs ⊂ L2 , s > 0, the inner product
on Σs
hf, φiΣs = limhvn , φiΣs
n

= limh(−∆ + m2 )s/2 vn , (−∆ + m2 )s/2 φiL2 + hV 1/2 vn , V 1/2 φiL2
n

= lim q(vn , φ) = limhvn , HφiL2 = hg, Hφi2 ,

where H = Hs,V is a positive self-adjoint operator in L2 , cf. (2.3) and the quadratic
form defined there. On the other hand, observe that
hf, φiΣs = h(−∆ + m2 )s/2 f, (−∆ + m2 )s/2 φiL2 + hV 1/2 vn , V 1/2 φiL2

=hf, Hφi2 .

Now as functions (or distributions) it follows that f = g in L2 by taking φ = H −1 ϕ
for all ϕ ∈ L2 . This proves Proposition 5.1.

Remark 5.3. The proof here relies on the fact that the spectrum of Hs,V is bounded
below by zero, whence one sees that HV = (−∆ + m2 )s + V has an inverse that
continuously maps L2 onto D(H).
