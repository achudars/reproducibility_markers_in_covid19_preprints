The IceCube neutrino observatory is a 3D array of photodetectors installed in the Antarctic
ice. It consists of 5,160 photomultiplier-tubes spread among 86 vertical strings making a total
detector volume of more than a cubic kilometer. It detects neutrinos via Cherenkov light of
charged relativistic particles from neutrino interactions with the detector volume. IceCube is,
due to its size and photosensor spacing, particularly sensitive to high-energy neutrinos. In this
analysis we search for dark matter that annihilates into a metastable mediator that subsequently
decays into Standard Model particles. These models yield an enhanced high-energy neutrino flux
from dark matter annihilation inside the Sun compared to models without a mediator. Neutrino
signals that are produced directly inside the Sun are strongly attenuated at higher energies due
to interactions with the solar plasma. In the models considered here, the mediator can escape
the Sun before producing any neutrinos, thereby avoiding attenuation. IceCube is ideal to search
for this enhanced high-energy neutrino signal. We present the sensitivities of an analysis of six
years of IceCube data looking for dark matter in the Sun considering mediator lifetimes between
1 ms to 10 s and dark matter masses between 200 GeV and 10 TeV. We show that IceCube
is sensitive to spin–dependent cross–sections of 3.45×10−34 cm2 for dark matter masses of 1 TeV.

1. IceCube
The IceCube Neutrino Observatory [1] is to date the largest neutrino telescope. Located at the
geographic South Pole, the observatory consists of one cubic kilometer–scale Cherenkov radiation
detector built in ice. IceCube has a cubic kilometre of instrumented volume at depths between
1.450 km and 2.450 km, as well as a square kilometer large cosmic–ray air–shower detector at
the surface of the ice. The primary scientific goals of the detector are to measure high-energy
astrophysical neutrinos and to identify their sources. The IceCube collaboration reported the first
observation of an astrophysical neutrino flux [2] in 2013, and in 2018, the detector found evidence
of a flaring blazar as a source of the astrophysical neutrinos [3]. Other scientific goals of the detector include measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters, cosmic–ray flux, and search for dark
matter and other exotic particles.

2. Secluded dark matter
Secluded dark matter is a particular model of dark matter where the dark matter particle decays
or annihilates into a metastable mediator particle before yielding any matter particles [4]. There
are a variety of different scenarios for dark matter with such a mediator. Various supersymmetric
models of dark matter exist where some superpartner particle is a mediator [5]. Alternatively there
are models where the mediator is a dark photon [6] or a dark higgs particle [7].
These mediators are assumed to have only negligible interactions with standard model particles and would be able to propagate through the solar plasma without any significant amount of
scattering or absorption. If the mediator is much lighter than the dark matter particle it will move
at a highly relativistic speed and escape the Sun after RSun
c ∼ 2.3 s and produce standard model
particles outside of the plasma. Standard model signals from these mediators are, therefore, not
affected by absorption in the Sun. For neutrino signals this would particularly enhance the high
energy spectrum of neutrinos, above 1 TeV, since as the Sun becomes opaque to neutrinos of these
energies. A diagram of this process is shown in figure 1.
The effect of this lack of absorption can be seen in figures 2 and 3. The neutrino spectra
shown there display a reduced number of high energy neutrinos for shorter mediator lifetimes,
particularly at higher dark matter particle masses one can see an effective cutoff of the signal at
energies above 1 TeV due to neutrino absorption. At lower energies more neutrinos can be found
for shorter lifetimes, as neutrinos that merely scatter in the solar plasma can lose energy while still
contributing to the total neutrino flux.
This amplified high energy neutrino flux makes neutrino telescopes such as IceCube especially
sensitive to secluded dark matter. A previous external study using IceCube public sensitivities [4],
was published using sensitivities for 317 live–days of data showing the potential of IceCube to
search for secluded dark matter. In this analysis we use 1058 live–days of data and simulation
estimates of IceCube.

a substantial background of atmospheric muons. This sample has been previously used in other
analyses [8].
In this search a wide range of model parameters was considered. Dark matter masses ranging from
200 GeV to 10 TeV and mediator lifetimes of 0.0001 s to 10 s were considered. The mediator mass
is assumed to be much smaller than the dark matter particle mass. Sensitivities were computed for
mediators decaying into muon neutrinos directly.

The analysis method employed here is a likelihood based analysis. To distinguish signal from
background, a region of interest around the position of the Sun is used. The region of interest
is defined as events with an angular separation with respect to the Sun direction, θ , such that
θ < 11.5◦ . Then the likelihood function used in this analysis is defined as
Ntot

L (ns ) = ∏ (ns S(ψi , Ei ) + Ntot B(ψi , Ei )) e−(ns +Ntot ) ,

(3.1)

i=1

where ns is the supposed number of signal events, Ntot is the total number of events in the
sample and S and B are probability density functions (pdfs) describing the likelihood of the event
with an angular separation to the Sun ψi and reconstructed energy Ei for the event number i. To
generate the signal pdf S the expected neutrino signal was taken from [9]. The background pdf B is
estimated using real data and scrambling the right ascension direction of the events. The likelihood
is then optimized with respect to ns and a test statistic value (TS) is calculated as

L (nopt )
T S = −2 log
,
L (0)


(3.2)

where nopt is the value of ns where the likelihood is maximal. To study the effectiveness of
the likelihood function pseudo experiments (PEs) with varying amounts of inserted signal events
were generated and from these TS distributions were calculated. Using the Feldman–Cousins
method [10] confidence intervals at a confidence level (CL) of 90% are calculated for fixed simulated values of signal strength. Sensitivities are set at a signal strength for which the corresponding
confidence interval lies entirely above the median of the TS distribution for PEs with no inserted
signal. The initial sensitivities are set on average numbers of detected events. These have to be

sensitivities is done using the detector acceptance Acc, which is defined by:

Acc
with the 90% CL sensitivity to the total neutrino flux Φ90% and the 90% CL sensitivity in
term of average detected signal neutrino events µ90% . The acceptance is calculated using the same
neutrino spectra used to calculate the function S and the IceCube detector simulation. In the next
step conversion factors calculated from the DarkSUSY simulation package [11] are used to convert
these into sensitivities to spin dependent and spin independent dark matter-nucleon scattering. In
the conversion factor an equilibrium between annihilation and gravitational capture is assumed
such that
Φ90% =

With an age of the Sun of 4.7 × 109 years this is generally the case for this type of search.

4. Sensitivities
Sensitivities to the signal neutrino flux are shown in figure 4. Here the dependency of the
sensitivity on the mediator lifetime is visible. Sensitivities significantly improve at higher mediator
lifetimes, especially at high dark matter particle masses. The final sensitivities to the spin dependent
scattering cross section are shown in figure 5. The sensitivities are compared to previous results
from an analysis using IceCube public data and to recent results from the HAWC experiment [12].
In the previous analysis using IceCube data mediator lifetimes long enough to avoid interactions
with the Sun were used. Consequently the sensitivities for a mediator lifetime of 10 s provide the
most accurate comparison. It can seen that this analysis presents a significant improvement. This
can be attributed to the use of a larger dataset, a more sophisticated analysis method and the use of
the neutrino event energy.
For the HAWC limits a mediator decaying purely into pairs of photons and tau leptons was
assumed. The comparison to the limits for decays into photons of is disfavourable, while the limits
for decays into tau leptons are surpassed. Neither channel allows a good comparison of the detectors themselves and given the very different decay channels IceCube results are complementary to

IceCube detector. Such sensitivities are currently in preparation.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion this analysis shows a significant improvement over previous analyses and will
be the first analysis of this kind performed by the IceCube collaboration. The expected sensitivities
are highly complimentary to the results of other experiments and are the best sensitivities for this
type of dark matter model from neutrino experiments for dark matter particles of masses between
200 GeV and 10 TeV. We show that IceCube is sensitive to spin–dependent dark matter–nucleon
scattering cross–sections of 3.45 · 10−34 cm2 for dark matter masses of 1 TeV. The analysis is close
to be finished and the final results of this search are to be published in the future.
