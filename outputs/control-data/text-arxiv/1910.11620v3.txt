A BSTRACT. We generalize the Van Kampen theorem for unions of non-connected spaces, due
to R. Brown and A. R. Salleh, to the context where families of subspaces of the base space B are
replaced with a ‘large’ space E equipped with a locally sectionable continuous map p : E → B.

1. Introduction
The most general purely topological version of the 1-dimensional theorem of Van Kampen
seems to be the following, which involves the fundamental groupoid π1 (B, S) on a set S of
base points, cf. [Brown, 1987, Brown, 2006, Brown, 2018]. Here we write also π1 (B, S) for
π1 (B, B ∩ S), so that if U is a subspace of B then π1 (U, S) is π1 (U, U ∩ S).
1.1. T HEOREM . [Brown-Salleh, 1984] Let (Bλ )λ∈Λ be a family of subspaces of B such that
the interiors of the sets Bλ (λ ∈ Λ) cover B, and let S be a subset of B. Suppose S meets each
path-component of each one-fold, two-fold, and each three-fold intersection of distinct members
of the family (Bλ )λ∈Λ . Then there is a coequalizer diagram in the category of groupoids:

in which stands for the coproduct in the category of groupoids, and α, β, and γ are determined by the inclusion maps Bλ ∩ Bµ → Bλ , Bλ ∩ Bµ → Bµ , and Bλ → B, respectively.
The idea for using more than one base point arose in the writing of the first version of
[Brown, 2006] in order to give a Van Kampen Theorem general enough to compute the fundamental group of the circle S 1 , which after all is the basic example in algebraic topology; of
course the “canonical” method for the circle is to use the covering map R → S 1 , but Theorem
1.1 deals also with a myriad of other cases.1
The use of many base points has been supported by Grothendieck in his 1984 “Esquisse
d’un Programme”, [Grothendieck, 1984, Section 2]:
Ceci est lié notamment au fait que les gens s’obstinent encore, en calculant avec
des groupes fondamentaux, a fixer un seul point base, plûtot que d’en choisir astucieusement tout un paquet qui soit invariant par les symetries de la situation,

lesquelles sont donc perdues en route. Dans certaines situations (comme des théorèmes
de descente à la Van Kampen pour les groupes fondamentaux) il est bien plus
élégant, voire indispensable pour y comprendre quelque chose, de travailler avec
des groupoı̈des fondamentaux par rapport à un paquet de points base convenable,....
And indeed, restricting to a single base point omits a vast range of other spaces available
in a local-to-global way, that might require even a large number of base points, and new methods for analyzing the colimits involved. It is unreasonable to suggest that “the answer has to be a
group”, or some form of presentation of a group; cf for example [Gill-Gillespie-Semeraro, 2018].
The use of groupoids also allows for the applications of Higgins’ “universal morphisms”, see
[Higgins, 2005] and the Appendix B5 Groupoids bifibered over Sets of [Brown-Higgins-Sivera, 2011]
; the fundamental group of the circle may be obtained from the groupoid I = π1 ([0, 1], {0, 1})
by identifying 0 and 1, as there is such a “universal morphism” from I to the group of integers. Applications of groupoid notions to orbit spaces are given in the (current) version of
[Brown, 2006, Chapter 11].
There are also accounts of the Van Kampen theorem for the fundamental group related to
universal covers and Galois theory, [Douady-Douady, 1979, Brown-Janelidze, 1997]; [Brown-Janelidze, 1997]
uses Galois theory of [Janelidze, 1991]. In this paper we return to the classical approach, but
replace families of subspaces of the base space B with a ‘large’ space E equipped with a locally sectionable continuous map p : E → B; this makes our Main Theorem 2.2, more general
than Theorem 1.1. In Section 2 we prove Theorem 2.2 directly, and then, after making various
additional remarks in Section 3, briefly discuss a possibility of deducing it from Theorem 1.1 in
Section 4; for instance such deduction is obviously possible when all points of B are taken as
base points.

2. Locally Sectionable Maps and the Main Theorem
A continuous map p : E → B of topological spaces is said to be locally sectionable if for every
b ∈ B there exist an open subset U of B such that b ∈ U and the map p−1 (U) → U induced by
p has a continuous section. We are interested in such maps for two reasons:
• Let (Bλ )λ∈Λ be a family of subspaces of B, let E be their coproduct, and suppose that the
interiors of the sets Bλ (λ ∈ Λ) cover B. Then the canonical map p : E → B is locally
sectionable, and such a family of subspaces is used in the Brown–Salleh version of van
Kampen Theorem [Brown-Salleh, 1984], recalled above as Theorem 1.1; we are going to
extend that theorem to arbitrary locally sectionable maps. For convenience, for any map
p : E → B and subset S of B we write π1 (E, S) and π1 (E ×B E, S) for π1 (E, E ×B S)
and π1 (E ×B E, E ×B E ×B S), respectively.
• As shown in [Janelidze-Tholen, 1991], every locally sectionable map is an effective descent morphism in the category of topological spaces.
Such maps also occur as surjective submersions in the context of [Nikolaus-Schweigert, 2011].

2.1. R EMARK . (a) Let us remove the word “distinct” from our requirement on S in Theorem
1.1. This will:
• also remove “one-fold, two-fold and”, since it will make one-fold and two-fold intersections special cases of three-fold intersections;
• make so modified Theorem 1.1 formally weaker by forcing each Uλ to become pathconnected.
However, this formally weaker version of Theorem 2.2 is actually easily equivalent to it.
(b) Consider the above-mentioned coproduct E of the family (Bλ )λ∈Λ and the associated function
F p : E → B. Since the fundamental groupoid functor π1 preserves coproducts, we can write
λ∈Λ π1 (Bλ , S) = π1 (E, S) and
G

π1 (Bλ ∩ Bµ , S) = π1 (E ×B E, S)

λ,µ∈Λ

which immediately suggests the formulation of the following Main Theorem 2.2. The proof,
as in [Brown-Salleh, 1984], is by verification of the universal property; for this purpose, we
do not even need to know that coequalisers exist in the category of groupoids, nor how to
construct them. However the details of the construction may be found in [Higgins, 2005,
Brown-Higgins-Sivera, 2011].
2.2. T HEOREM . Let p : E → B be a locally sectionable continuous map of topological spaces,
and S a subset of B such that the inverse image E ×B E ×B E ×B S of S under the canonical
map E ×B E ×B E → B meets every path-component of E ×B E ×B E. Then there is a
coequalizer diagram in the category of groupoids

in which the functor γ is induced by p : E → B and the functors α, β are induced respectively
by the first and the second projections p1 , p2 : E ×B E → E.
Note that our assumption on path-components of E ×B E ×B E implies similar assumptions
on path-connected components of E and of E ×B E.
The rest of this section, where we will use notation and assumptions of Theorem 2.2, will
be devoted to its proof.
Let U be the set of all open subsets U of B such that the map p−1 (U) → U induced by p
has a continuous section, and let us fix a U-indexed family
(sU : U → p−1 (U))U ∈U
of such sections. After that we introduce

2.3. D EFINITION . A weighted path (in (B, S)) is a system (f, n, t, U , g), in which:
• f : [0, 1] → B is a path in B with f (0) and f (1) in S;
• n is a (non-zero) natural number;
• t = (t0 , . . . , tn ) is a sequence of n + 1 real numbers with 0 = t0 < t1 < . . . < tn = 1;
• U = (U1 , . . . , Un ) is a sequence of n open sets from U with f ([ti−1 , ti ]) ⊆ Ui , or, equivalently [ti−1 , ti ] ⊆ f −1 (Ui ), for each i = 1, . . . , n; the map [ti−1 , ti ] → Ui induced by f
will be denoted by fU,i , or simply by fi , if there is no danger of confusion;
• g = (g1 , . . . , gn−1 ) is a sequence of n − 1 paths [0, 1] → E ×B E with
gi (0) = (sUi f (ti ), sUi+1 f (ti ))
and gi (1) in the inverse image (E×B E)×B S of S under the canonical map E×B E → B,
for each i = 1, . . . , n − 1.
We will also say that (n, t, U, g) is a weight of f .
From the definition of U, the fact that the inverse image E ×B E ×B S of S under the
canonical map E ×B E → B meets every path-component of E ×B E, and the fact that [0, 1] is
a compact space, we obtain:
2.4. L EMMA . Every path f : [0, 1] → B in B, with f (0) and f (1) in S, has a weight. Moreover,
for every non-zero natural number n and every sequence of n + 1 real numbers with 0 = t0 <
t1 < . . . < tn = 1 and each f ([ti−1 , ti ]) (i = 1 . . . n) in some U ∈ U, a weight (n, t, U , g) for f
can be chosen with the same n and t = (t0 , . . . , tn ), and even with each Ui chosen in advance.
Our next definition and the following lemmas show why weights are useful. Here and below,
the morphism (in a suitable fundamental groupoid) determined by a path f will be denoted by
[f ] (not to be confused with, say, [0, 1] or [ti−1 , ti ]). Moreover, we will do same when the domain
of f is not just [0, 1] but any [t, t′ ] with t < t′ .
2.5. D EFINITION . For a weighted path (f, n, t, U , g), the associated sequence of morphisms
in π1 (E, S) is the sequence (hn , . . . , h1 ) in which:
• h1 = [p1 g1 ][sU1 f1 ];
• hi = [p1 gi ][sUi fi ][p2 gi−1 ]−1 , if 2 6 i 6 n − 1;
• hn = [sUn fn ][p2 gn−1 ]−1 .
Here we use composition of maps inside square brackets and composition of morphisms in
π1 (E) outside them (in the order used in category theory).
The following diagrams in the groupoid π1 (E) (which are not diagrams in π1 (E, S)) help
to understand this definition:

Let G be an arbitrary groupoid and δ : π1 (E, S) → G an arbitrary functor with δα = δβ.
2.6. L EMMA . Let (hn , . . . , h1 ) be as in Definition 2.5. Then:
(a) The sequence (δ(hn ), . . . , δ(h1 )) of morphisms in G is composable; in particular this
applies to δ = γ, making (γ(hn ), . . . , γ(h1 )) a composable sequence of morphisms in
π1 (B, S).
(b) γ(hn ) . . . γ(h1 ) = [f ].
P ROOF. (a): We need to show that the domain of δ(hi+1 ) is the same as the codomain of δ(hi ),
for every i = 1, . . . , n − 1. Writing dom and cod for domain and codomain, respectively, we
have:
dom(δ(hi+1 )) = δ(dom(hi+1 ))
= δ(dom([p1 gi+1 ][sUi+1 fi+1 ][p2 gi ]−1 ))
(i)

= δ(cod([p2 gi ]))
(ii)

= δ(p2 gi (1)) = δ(p1 gi (1))
= δ(cod([p1 gi ])) = δ(cod([p1 gi ][sUi fi ][p2 gi−1 ]−1 )) = δ(cod(hi )) ,

where equality (i) holds because all calculations inside π1 (E, S) can equivalently be made inside π1 (E); and equality (ii) holds since (p1 gi (1), p2 gi (1)) = gi (1) belongs to E ×B E and
δα = δβ.
(b): Here we in fact need a calculation in π1 (B, S), in which we can replace γ : π1 (E, S) →
π1 (B, S) with π1 (p) : π1 (E) → π1 (B). This allows us to present γ(hn ) . . . γ(h1 ) as the composite of
f (0) = f (t0 )

where we use the fact that, for each i = 1, . . . , n, the image of [sUi fi ] : sUi f (ti−1 ) → sUi f (ti )
under π1 (p) is [fi ] : f (ti−1 ) → f (ti ) (since sU (U ∈ U) are local sections of p). After that, note
also that [pp1 gi ] = [pp2 gi ], and makes the composite above equal to [fn ] . . . [f1 ] = [f ].

2.7. L EMMA . Let (f, n, t, U, g) and (f, n, t, U, g ′) be weighted paths and (hn , . . . , h1 ) and
(h′n , . . . , h′1 ) their associated sequences of morphisms in π1 (E, S). Then
δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ) = δ(h′n ) . . . δ(h′1 ) .
P ROOF. We can assume, without loss of generality, gi = gi′ for all i = 1, . . . , n−1 except i = k,
for some k. Assuming that we only need to prove the equality δ(hk+1 )δ(hk ) = δ(h′k+1 )δ(h′k ).
There are three cases to consider, k = 1, 2 6 k 6 n − 2, and k = n − 1, but we will consider
only second case (since two other cases can obviously be treated similarly). We have:
(a) δ([p1 gk ][p1 gk′ ]−1 ) = δα([gk ][gk′ ]−1 ) : δα(gk′ (1)) → δα(gk (1)) in G, where, although we
compose morphisms in π1 (E) and π1 (E ×B E), the results [p1 gk ][p1 gk′ ]−1 and [gk ][gk′ ]−1
belong to π1 (E, S) and π1 (E ×B E, S), respectively;
(b) similarly, δ([p2 gk ][p2 gk′ ]−1 ) = δβ([gk ][gk′ ]−1 ) : δβ(gk′ (1)) → δβ(gk (1)) in G;
(c) since δα = δβ, (a) and (b) imply δ([p1 gk ][p1 gk′ ]−1 ) = δ([p2 gk ][p2 gk′ ]−1 );
(d) In G we compute:
δ([p2 gk ][p2 gk′ ]−1 )δ([p1 gk′ ][p1 gk ]−1 ) = δ([p2 gk ][p2 gk′ ]−1 )(δ([p1 gk ][p1 gk′ ]−1 ))−1 = 1δα(gk (1)) = 1δβ(gk (1))

Using (d) we calculate:
δ(hk+1)δ(hk ) =

δ([p1 gk+1 ][sUk+1 fk+1 ][p2 gk ]−1 )δ([p1 gk ][sUk fk ][p2 gk−1 ]−1 )

δ(hk+1 )δ(hk ).

This completes the proof.
The following lemma is stronger, but it uses Lemma 2.7 in its proof.
2.8. L EMMA . Let (f, n, t, U, g) and (f, n′ , t′ , U ′ , g ′) be weighted paths and (hn , . . . , h1 ) and
(h′n′ , . . . , h′1 ) their associated sequences of morphisms in π1 (E, S). Then
δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ) = δ(h′n′ ) . . . δ(h′1 ) .
P ROOF. We can assume, without loss of generality, that {t0 . . . tn } ∩ {t′0 . . . t′n′ } = {0, 1}.
Indeed, using the second assertion of Lemma 2.4, we can choose a weight (n′′ , t′′ , U ′′ , g ′′)
for f with {t0 . . . tn } ∩ {t′′0 . . . t′′n′′ } = {0, 1} and {t′0 . . . t′n′ } ∩ {t′′0 . . . t′′n′′ } = {0, 1}, and
then δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ) = δ(h′′n′′ ) . . . δ(h′′1 ) and δ(h′n′ ) . . . δ(h′1 ) = δ(h′′n′′ ) . . . δ(h′′1 ) would imply
δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ) = δ(h′n′ ) . . . δ(h′1 ) (in obvious notation).
After that let us introduce the following notation:
• ñ = n + n′ − 1.

Here we omitted routine calculations to show that the composites involved are well defined in
π1 (E ×B E), and similar routine calculations show that
(δα(h̃ñ ), . . . , δα(h̃1 )) = (δβ(h̃ñ ), . . . , δβ(h̃1 ))
is a composable sequences of morphisms in G.
Our aim is to prove that

but since the middle equality is trivial, while the first and third one are similar to each other, it
suffices to prove the first equality.
Let χ : {0, . . . , n} → {0, . . . , ñ} be the map defined by χ(j) = i ⇔ tj = t̃i . We have
δα(h̃ñ ) . . . δα(h̃1 ) = δα(h̃χ(n) ) . . . δα(h̃χ(n−1)+1 ) . . . δα(h̃χ1 ) . . . δα(h̃1 ),
and so to prove the desired first equality above it suffices to prove the equality
δ(hj ) = δα(h̃χ(j) ) . . . δα(h̃χ(j−1)+1 ),

(1)

for every j = 1, . . . , n. Let us do it assuming 1 < j < n (since in the cases j = 1 and j = n it
can be done similarly, but with a bit shorter calculation). For, putting χ(j) = i, we observe:
(a) If χ(j) = χ(j − 1) + 1, we have
δα(h̃χ(j) ) . . . δα(h̃χ(j−1)+1 ) = δα(h̃χ(j) )

where the second equality follows from the third line in the definition of h̃i .
(b) If χ(j) = χ(j − 1) + 2, which gives
t̃χ(j)−2 = t̃χ(j−1) = tj−1

and then

t̃χ(j)−1 = t′ϕ(j−1) = t′ϕ(j)−1 ,

we have
δα(h̃χ(j) ) . . . δα(h̃χ(j−1)+1 ) = δα(h̃χ(j) )δα(h̃χ(j)−1 )

where:

with i − 1;
− the sixth equality follows from the equation ϕ′ (ϕ(j) − 1) = j, while this equation
is easy to check having in mind that t′ϕ(j)−1 = t̃χ(j)−1 and tj = t̃χ(j) ;
− the last equation follows from the fact that
([q1 ri ][sUj fi ][q2 ri−1 ]−1 , [q2 ri−1 ][sUj fi−1 ][q3 ri−2 ]−1 )
is a composable pair of morphisms in π1 (E, S).

(c) Similarly, whenever χ(j) > χ(j − 1) + 2, one can show that δα(h̃χ(j) ) . . . δα(h̃χ(j−1)+1 )
is given by
δ([q1 rχ(j) ][sUj fχ(j) ][sUj fχ(j)−1 ] . . . [sUj fχ(j)+2 ][sUj fχ(j)+1 ][q3 rχ(j) ]−1 ).
Now, since (inside π1 (E)) we have [sUj fχ(j) ] . . . [sUj fχ(j)+1 ] = [sUj fU,j ], to prove (1) it
would suffice to prove the equality
[p1 gj ][sUj fU,j ][p2 gj−1 ]−1 = [q1 rχ(j) ][sUj fU ,j ][q3 rχ(j) ]−1 .

(2)

Moreover, thanks to Lemma 2.7, in proving (2) we are allowed to change the component g of
the weighted path (f, n, t, U, g). But this makes the equality (2) trivial, since we can define g
by gj = hq1 rχ(j) , q3 rχ(j) i, which makes p1 gj = q1 rχ(j) and p2 gj−1 = q3 rχ(j) .
2.9. D EFINITION . Let P = (f, n, t, U, g) and P ′ = (f ′ , n′ , t′ , U ′ , g ′) be weighted paths with
f (0) = f ′ (0), f (1) = f ′ (1), n = n′ , t = t′ , and U = U ′ . A homotopy H : P → P ′ is a
continuous map H : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → B with
(a) H(t, 0) = f (t), H(t, 1) = f ′ (t), H(0, t) = f (0), H(0, t) = f (0) for every t ∈ [0, 1];
(b) H([ti−1 , ti ] × [0, 1]) ⊆ Ui , for each i = 1, . . . , n.
We will say that P and P ′ are homotopic when such a homotopy H : P → P ′ does exist.
2.10. L EMMA . Let (f, n, t, U, g) and (f ′ , n′ , t′ , U ′ , g ′) be homotopic weighted paths, and let
(hn , . . . , h1 ) and (h′n , . . . , h′1 ) be their associated sequences of morphisms in π1 (E, S). Then
δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ) = δ(h′n′ ) . . . δ(h′1 ).
P ROOF. Thanks to Lemma 2.7, we can change g and g ′ as it will be suitable for our argument.
We will not change g ′ , but, given a homotopy H : P → P ′ , assume that [gi ] (i = 1, . . . , n − 1)
is the composite
(sUi f (ti ), sUi+1 f (ti ))

in π1 (E). Since its square part represents (up to ordinary homotopy) the boundary of the sUi Himage of the rectangle [ti−1 , ti ] × [0, 1], we obtain
[sUi fi′ ] = [p1 Hi ][sUi fi ][p2 Hi−1 ]−1 ,
which gives hi = h′i , according to the second formula in Definition 2.5 and our choice of g.
Proving that hi = h′i for i = 1 and i = n is similar (and a bit shorter). Hence δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ) =
δ(h′n′ ) . . . δ(h′1 ), as desired.

2.11. L EMMA . Let f and f ′ be paths in B with endpoints in S and [f ] = [f ′ ] in π1 (B, S).
There exists natural numbers m and n, weighted paths P i = (f i , n, t, U i , g i ) (i = 1, . . . , m)
and P ′i = (f i , n, t, U ′i , g ′i ) (i = 0, . . . , m − 1) with f 0 = f , f 1 = f ′ , U ′i−1 = U i , and
homotopies H i : P ′i−1 → P i (i = 1, . . . , m).
P ROOF. [f ] = [f ′ ] means that there exists H : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → B satisfying condition (a) of
Definition 2.9. Then, according to Lemma 6.8.5 in [Borceux-Janelidze, 2001], there exist finite
sequences x0 , . . . , xm and y0 , . . . , ym of real numbers with
• 0 = x0 < . . . < xm = 1 and 0 = y0 < . . . < yn = 1,
• for every (i, j) ∈ {1, . . . , m} × {1, . . . , n}, there exist U(i,j) ∈ U with
H([yj−1, yj ] × [xi−1 , xi ]) ⊆ U(i,j) .
Using these sequences we can define
• f i by f i (y) = H(y, xi ) (i = 0, . . . , m),
• t by tj = yj (j = 0, . . . , n),
• U i by U i j = U(i,j) (i = 1, . . . , m and j = 1, . . . , n),
• U ′i by U ′i j = U(i+1,j) (i = 0, . . . , m − 1 and j = 1, . . . , n),
and choose g 0 , . . . , g m and g ′0 , . . . , g ′m arbitrarily (see the last part of Lemma 2.4). It remains
to note that H induces homotopies H i : P ′i−1 → P i (i = 1, . . . , m) via [xi−1 , xi ] ≈ [0, 1].
Now, following Lemmas 2.7 and 2.8, we make their strongest version:
2.12. L EMMA . Let (f, n, t, U , g) and (f ′ , n′ , t′ , U ′ , g ′) be weighted paths with [f ] = [f ′ ] in
π1 (B, S), and (hn , . . . , h1 ) and (h′n′ , . . . , h′1 ) their associated sequences of morphisms in π1 (E, S).
Then δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ) = δ(h′n′ ) . . . δ(h′1 ).
P ROOF. Let us write P = (f, n, t, U , g), δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ) = δ[P ], and use similar notation for
other weighted paths. Using weighted paths P i (i = 1, . . . , m) and P ′i (i = 0, . . . , m − 1) from
Lemma 2.11, we see that
• δ[P ] = δ[P ′0 ] by Lemma 2.8;
• δ[P ′0 ] = δ[P 1 ] by Lemma 2.10;
• δ[P 1 ] = δ[P ′1 ] by Lemma 2.8 again, and so on.
This gives δ[P ] = δ[P ′ ], as desired.

VAN KAMPEN’S THEOREM FOR LOCALLY SECTIONABLE MAPS

Lemma 2.12 easily implies that sending [f ] to δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ), where (hn , . . . , h1 ) is as in
Definition 2.5, determines a functor ε : π1 (B, S) → G, and, to prove Theorem 2.2, it remains
to prove that it is the unique functor with εγ = δ.
To prove the equality εγ = δ, we chose:
• any path e in E with endpoints in E ×B S = p−1 (S);
• a triple (n, t, U) as in Definition 2.3 with f = p(e), ei denoting the restriction of e on
[ti−1 , ti ], and fi denoting the map [ti−1 , ti ] → Ui induced by f ;
• paths ri : [0, 1] → E×B E×B E (i = 1, . . . , n−1) with ri (0) = (sUi f (ti ), e(ti ), sUi+1 f (ti ))
and ri (1) in the inverse image (E ×B E ×B E) ×B S of S under the canonical map
E ×B E ×B E → B,
for each i = 0, . . . , n (again, such choices are possible by our assumption on pathcomponents of E ×B E ×B E in Theorem 2.2).
Then, using the weighted path (f, n, t, U , g), in which gi = hq1 ri , q3 ri i, and its associated
sequence hn , . . . , h1 , we can write:
εγ([e]) = ε([f ]) = δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 )
= δ([sUn fn ][p2 gn−1 ]−1 ) . . . δ([p1 gi ][sUi fi ][p2 gi−1 ]−1 ) . . . δ([p1 g1 ][sU1 f1 ])
= δ([sUn fn ][q3 rn−1 ]−1 ) . . . δ([q1 ri ][sUi fi ][q3 ri−1 ]−1 ) . . . δ([q1 r1 ][sU1 f1 ]).
In order to complete this calculation, note that:
(a) psUi fi = pei , pq3 ri = pq2 ri , and pq1 ri = pq2 ri ;
(b) as follows from (a), hsUi fi , ei i, hq3 ri , q2 ri i, and hq1 ri , q2 ri i are paths in E;
(c) thanks to (b), we can write:
δ([sUn fn ][q3 rn−1 ]−1 ) =
=
δ([q1 ri ][sUi fi ][q3 ri−1 ]−1 ) =
=
δ([q1 r1 ][sU1 f1 ]) =
=

δα([hsUn fn , en i][hq3 rn−1 , q2 rn−1 i]−1 )
δβ([hsUn fn , en i][hq3 rn−1 , q2 rn−1 i]−1 ) = δ([en ][q2 rn−1 ]−1 ),
δα([hq1 ri , q2 ri i][hsUi fi , ei i][hq3 ri−1 , q2 ri−1 i]−1 )
δβ([hq1 ri , q2 ri i][hsUi fi , ei i][hq3 ri−1 , q2 ri−1 i]−1 ) = δ([q2 ri ][ei ][q2 ri−1 ]−1 ),
δα([hq1 r1 , q2 r1 i][hsU1 f1 , e1 i])
δβ([hq1 r1 , q2 r1 i][hsU1 f1 , e1 i]) = δ([q2 r1 ][e1 ]);

(d) the sequence [en ][q2 rn−1 ]−1 , . . . , [q2 ri ][ei ][q2 ri ]−1 , . . . , [q2 r1 ][e1 ] is a composable sequence
of morphisms in π1 (E, S), and so
δ([en ][q2 rn−1 ]−1 ) . . . δ([q2 ri ][ei ][q2 ri ]−1 ) . . . δ([q2 r1 ][e1 ])
= δ([en ][q2 rn−1 ]−1 . . . [q2 ri ][ei ][q2 ri ]−1 . . . [q2 r1 ][e1 ]) = δ([en ] . . . [e1 ]) = δ([e]).

12

RONALD BROWN, GEORGE JANELIDZE, AND GEORGE PESCHKE

That is,
εγ([e]) = δ([sUn fn ][q3 rn−1 ]−1 ) . . . δ([q1 ri ][sUi fi ][q3 ri−1 ]−1 ) . . . δ([q1 r1 ][sU1 f1 ])
= δ([en ][q2 rn−1 ]−1 ) . . . δ([q2 ri ][ei ][q2 ri ]−1 ) . . . δ([q2 r1 ][e1 ]) = δ([e])
(where the second equality follows from (c)), which proves that ε satisfies the equality εγ = δ.
The uniqueness is easy: for any functor ε : π1 (B, S) → G with ε′ γ = δ, and any path f in
π1 (B, S), we have:
ε′ ([f ]) = ε′ (γ(hn ) . . . γ(h1 )) = ε′ γ(hn ) . . . ε′ γ(h1 )) = δ(hn ) . . . δ(h1 ) = ε([f ]),
where:
• (hn , . . . , h1 ) is the sequence of morphisms in π1 (E, S) associated with any weighted path
constructed for f , which does exist by Lemma 2.4.
• the first equality follows from Lemma 2.6(b).
This completes our proof of Theorem 2.2.

3. Additional remarks
In what follows, Set, Top, and Grpd denote the categories of sets, of topological spaces, and
op
of groupoids, respectively; ∆ denotes the simplicial category, and, accordingly, Set∆ denotes
the category of simplicial sets.
Taking S = B in Theorem 2.2 we obtain:
3.1. C OROLLARY. Let p : E → B be a locally sectionable continuous map of topological
spaces. There is a coequalizer diagram
π1 (E ×B E)

α
β

/
/

π1 (E)

γ

/

π1 (B) ,

in Grpd, in which the functors α, β, and γ are induced respectively by the first and the second
projection E ×B E → E, and by p.
3.2. R EMARK . Let us mention a couple of much easier counterparts of Corollary 3.1:
(a) Suppose p : E → B itself is sectionable, that is, p is a split epimorphism in Top. Then
the diagram
/
/B,
/E
E ×B E
becomes an absolute coequalizer diagram, that is, it is preserved not just by π1 , but by
every functor defined on Top. In particular, this is the case when p is a trivial fibre bundle.

VAN KAMPEN’S THEOREM FOR LOCALLY SECTIONABLE MAPS

13

(b) More generally, suppose the image S ∆ (p) of p : E → B under the singular complex
op
functor S ∆ : Top → Set∆ is an epimorphism. Then the diagram of Corollary 3.1
is again a coequalizer diagram since: (i) the functor S ∆ being a right adjoint preserves
pullbacks, and so
/
/ S ∆ (E) ,
S ∆ (E ×B E)
op

is the kernel pair of S ∆ (p); (ii) every epimorphism in Set∆ is a coequalizer of its kerop
nel pair; (iii) the fundamental groupoid functor Set∆ → Grpd being a left adjoint
preserves coequalizers, and, composed with S ∆ , gives the fundamental groupoid functor Top → Grpd. Moreover, our assumption here can be weakened by using certain
truncated simplicial sets instead of all simplicial sets.
Corollary 3.1 could be called the ‘absolute case’ of Theorem 2.2. The ‘opposite extreme
case’, which seems to be a new simple way of calculating the fundamental groups of some
topological spaces is:
3.3. C OROLLARY. Let p : E → B be a locally sectionable continuous map of topological
spaces, and x an element of B such that the inverse image (E ×B E ×B E) ×B {x} of x under
the canonical map E ×B E ×B E → B meets every path-component of E ×B E ×B E. Then
the diagram
π1 (E ×B E, {x})

α
β

/
/

π1 (E, {x})

γ

/

π1 (B, x),

in which the functors α, β, and γ are induced by the first and the second projection E ×B E →
E, and by p, respectively, is a coequalizer diagram in Grpd.
3.4. R EMARK . When B is a ‘good’ space admitting a universal covering map p : E → B, the
groupoids π1 (E ×B E) and π1 (E) are coproducts of indiscrete groupoids. Therefore Theorem
2.2 and Corollaries 3.1 and 3.3 present π1 (B, S), π1 (B), and π1 (B, x), respectively, as colimits
of indiscrete groupoids.
3.5. R EMARK . Since the fundamental group(oid) of a space B does not in general classify covering spaces over B, one cannot deduce Theorem 1.1 from the results of [Brown-Janelidze, 1997]
based on categorical Galois theory [Janelidze, 1991]. Nevertheless, a detailed comparison of
the two approaches would be desirable, especially since all locally sectionable continuous maps
are effective descent morphisms in Top. In particular, it would be interesting to answer the
following questions:
(a) What is a necessary and sufficient condition on p : E → B under which the diagram
considered in Corollary 3.1 is a coequalizer diagram in Grpd?
(b) Compare the diagrams considered in Theorem 2.2 and in Corollary 3.1. In general there
is no way to conclude that the first of them is a coequalizer diagram whenever the second
one is. What are reasonable conditions on p : E → B under which such conclusion can
be made?

4. Theorem 1.1 almost implies Theorem 2.2
Let Top2 be the category of pairs (X, A), where X is a topological space and A is a subset of
X. In the notation of Section 2, consider the diagram
(E ×B E ×B E ′ ×B E ′ , S)

in Top2 , in which:
• E ′ is the coproduct of all elements of U, and p′ is induced by all the coproduct injections;
• presenting pairs we use the same convention as for the fundamental groupoids, that is, we
write (E, S) instead of (E, E ×B S), etc.
• the bottom right-hand square is a pullback and all unlabeled arrows are obviously defined
canonical morphisms.
We observe:
(a) Once the columns of this diagram satisfy the triple intersection assumption of Theorem
1.1, each of them is carried to a coequalizer diagram by the fundamental groupoid functor
Top2 → Grpd.
(b) The first two rows of this diagram are absolute coequalizer diagrams (for the same reason
as in Remark 3.2(a)).
(c) As follows from (b), the first two rows of this diagram are also carried to a coequalizer
diagram by the fundamental groupoid functor Top2 → Grpd.
(d) Under the assumption made in (a), Theorem 2.2 follows from (a) and (c).
That is, under a mild additional condition, Theorem 2.2 can be deduced from 1.1 using the
pullback of p and p′ above and simple purely-categorical arguments. In particular, this mild
additional condition obviously holds when S = B.
