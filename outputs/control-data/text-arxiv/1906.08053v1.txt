Abstract
We present a short review of the evolution of the methodology of
the Method of simplest equation for obtaining exact particular solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (NPDEs) and the recent extension of a version of this methodology called Modified method
of simplest equation. This extension makes the methodology capable
to lead to solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations that are
more complicated than a single solitary wave.

Introduction

Differential equations occur frequently in the mathematical modeling of many
problems from natural and social sciences, e.g., fluid mechanics, plasma
physics, atmospheric and ocean sciences, chemistry, materials science, biology, economics, social dynamics, etc. [1] - [19]. Often the model equations are
nonlinear partial differential equations and by means of the exact solutions
of these equations one : (i) can understand complex nonlinear phenomena
such as existence and change of different regimes of functioning of complex
systems, transfer processes, etc. or (ii) can test computer programs for numerical simulations by comparison of the obtained numerical results to the
corresponding exact solutions. Because of the above the exact solutions of
NPDEs are studied very intensively [20] - [28].
The research on the methodology for obtaining exact solutions of NPDEs
started by search for transformations that transform the solved nonlinear
partial differential equation to a linear differential equation. The Hopf-Cole
1

transformation [29], [30] transforms the nonlinear Burgers equation to the
linear heat equation and the numerous attempts for obtaining such transformations led to the Method of Inverse Scattering Transform [20], [23]. Almost
parallel to this Hirota developed a direct method for obtaining of exact solutions of NPDEs - Hirota method [1], [31] that is based on bilinearization
of the solved nonlinear partial differential equation by means of appropriate
transformations. Truncated Painleve expansions may lead to many of these
appropriate transformations [28], [32] - [35]. The line of research of interest
for us below emerged when Kudryashov [36] studied the possibility for obtaining exact solutions of NPDEs by a truncated Painleve expansion where
the truncation happens after the ”constant term” (i.e., the constant term
is kept in the expansion). Kudryashov formulated the Method of Simplest
Equation (MSE) [37] based on determination of singularity order n of the
solved NPDE and searching of particular solution of this equation as series
containing powers of solutions of a simpler equation called simplest equation.
Kudryashov and Loguinova [38] extended the methodology and applied it for
obtaining traveling wave solutions of NPDEs. ( for several examples see [39]
- [45]).
Below we shall review the results of our contribution to the method of
simplest equation from our first research on the use of the ordinary differential equation of Bernoulli as simplest equation [46] and by application of
the method to ecology and population dynamics [47] where we have used the
concept of the balance equation to our last version of the method based on
more than one simplest equations and eventually to more than one balance
equation. We note that the version called called Modified Method of Simplest Equation - MMSE [48], [49] based on determination of the kind of the
simplest equation and truncation of the series of solutions of the simplest
equation by means of application of a balance equation is equivalent of the
Method of simplest equation. Up to now our contributions to the methodology and its application are connected to the MMSE [50] - [56]. We note
especially the article [57] where we have extended the methodology of the
MMSE to simplest equations of the class

Figure 1: Versions on the MMSE. MMSE1 is based on 1 simplest equation
and 1 balance equation. MMSEn is based on n simplest equations (n ≥ 1)
and on one or more than one balance equation. Note that in the two versions
of the method the relationship between the solution of the solved NPDE and
the simplest equation(s) is different.
The methodology of MMSE1 is as follows. Let us consider a nonlinear
partial differential equation
(2.1)

N (u, . . . ) = 0

where N (u, . . . ) depends on the function u(x, t) and some of its derivatives
participate in (u can be a function of more than 1 spatial coordinate). The
steps of the methodology of the modified method of simplest equation for
obtaining particular traveling wave solutions of a NPDE are:
3

1. By means of the traveling wave ansatz ξ = αx + betat (α and β are
parameters) u(x, t) is transformed to u(ξ) which is represented as a
function of other function f that is solution of some ordinary differential
equation (the simplest equation). The form of the function F (f ) is can
be different. One example is
(2.2)

N
X

u=

µn f n

i=−M

µ is a parameter. In the most cases one uses M = 0.
2. The application of Eq.(2.2) to Eq.(2.1) transforms the left-hand side of
this equation. Let the result of this transformation be a function that
is a sum of terms where each term contains some function multiplied
by a coefficient. This coefficient contains some of the parameters of the
solved equation and some of the parameters of the solution. In the most
cases a balance procedure must be applied in order to ensure that the
above-mentioned relationships for the coefficients contain more than
one term ( e.g., if the result of the transformation is a polynomial then
the balance procedure has to ensure that the coefficient of each term of
the polynomial is a relationship that contains at least two terms). This
balance procedure leads to one relationship among the parameters of
the solved equation and parameters of the solution. The relationship
is called balance equation.
3. We may obtain a nontrivial solution of Eq. (2.1) if all coefficients mentioned above are set to 0. This condition usually leads to a system of
nonlinear algebraic equations for the coefficients of the solved nonlinear
PDE and for the coefficients of the solution. Any nontrivial solution of
this algebraic system leads to a solution the studied nonlinear partial
differential equation. Usually the above system of algebraic equations
contains many equations that have to be solved with the help of a
computer algebra system.
One can mention use of elements of MMSE1 in some of our first publications [58] - [62]. Our interest in the research on the exact solutions of
nonlinear PDEs was revived when we have encountered such an equation
as model of traveling waves in population dynamics [6]. We analyzed the
equation

where D, E, F, G, H are parameters. In order to obtain the exact traveling
wave solution of this equation we have used representation of the solution as
finite series of power of solutions of Bernoulli equation and the concept of
balance equation. The methodology used in [6] was used in [7] for the case
of traveling waves in a system of two interacting populations. The next step
was to search for exact solutions of more complicated equations. This was
made for the class of equations [46]

where αp , βq and µm are parameters. Bernoulli and Riccati equations are
used as simplest equations and the balance equation connected to the class
of equations (2.4) is obtained. The developed theory is used for obtaining
exact solutions of equations of Ablowitz and Zepetella, Huxley equation for
gene propagation, equation connected to biological invasions, and more complicated equations.
Further application of the methodology was to the equations of the reactiondiffusion class [47]

Above α, β, γ are parameters and D and F depend on the population density

As first result here the corresponding balance equations for (2.5) and (2.6)
are obtained. Then numerous solutions are obtained for the two classes of
studied equations (2.5) and (2.6).

(2.10)

The MMSE1 was applied to Eqs.(2.9) and (2.10) and the balance equations
are obtained for the case when the solution is searched as power series constructed by solutions of a simplest equation. As illustration of the methodology exact solutions of the b-equations and of the generalized Degasperis Processi equations are obtained.
The role of the simplest equation in the methodology of the MMSE1
is discussed in [51]. As examples of simplest equations are discussed the
6

equations of Bernoulli, Riccati and the differential equation for the elliptic
functions of Jacobi. It is shown how the choice of the simplest equation influences the balance equation as well as the system of algebraic equations that
is obtained by the application of the methodology of the modified method of
simplest equation. It is shown that any nontrivial solution of certain system
of nonlinear algebraic equations leads to exact traveling wave solution of a
nonlinear partial differential equation. As examples for obtaining exact solutions on the basis of Riccati equation as simplest equation one discussed the
nonlinear partial differential equations of Newell - Whitehead and FitzHugh
- Nagumo. The general algorithm for obtaining differential equations that
have exact traveling wave solutions constructed as power series of solutions of
selected simplest equation is presented. The case of use of differential equations for the Jacobi elliptic functions as simplest equations was discussed
further in [52]. Special attention to the exact traveling wave solutions of
the nonlinear equations that are models for nonlinear water waves is given
in [53] where exact traveling wave solutions are obtained for the extended
Korteweg-de Vries equation

for the case when the equation of Bernoulli and Riccati are used for simplest
equations and for several forms of the polynomial g(u).
Several interesting theorems have been proved in connection with the
application of the Modified method of simplest equation. In [55] the following
theorem was proved:
Theorem: Let P be a polynomial of the function u(x, t) and its derivatives. u(x, t) belongs to the differentiability class C k , where k is the highest
order of derivative participating in P. P can contain some or all of the following parts: (A) polynomial of u; (B) monomials that contain derivatives
of u with respect to x and/or products of such derivatives. Each such monomial can be multiplied by a polynomial of u; (C) monomials that contain
derivatives of u with respect to t and/or products of such derivatives. Each
such monomial can be multiplied by a polynomial of u; (D) monomials that
contain mixed derivatives of u with respect to x and t and/or products of
such derivatives. Each such monomial can be multiplied by a polynomial of
7

u; (E) monomials that contain products of derivatives of u with respect to x
and derivatives of u with respect to t. Each such monomial can be multiplied
by a polynomial of u; (F) monomials that contain products of derivatives of
u with respect to x and mixed derivatives of u with respect to x and t. Each
such monomial can be multiplied by a polynomial of u; (G) monomials that
contain products of derivatives of u with respect to t and mixed derivatives of
u with respect to x and t. Each such monomial can be multiplied by a polynomial of u; (H) monomials that contain products of derivatives of u with
respect to x, derivatives of u with respect to t and mixed derivatives of u with
respect to x and t. Each such monomial can be multiplied by a polynomial of
u.
Let us consider the nonlinear partial differential equation
P = 0.

(2.13)

We search for solutions of this equation of the kind u(ξ) = u(αx + βt) =
u(ξ) = γf (ξ), where γ is a parameter and f (ξ) is solution of the simplest
equation fξ2 = 4(f 2 − f 3 ). The substitution of this solution in Eq.(2.13) leads
to a relationship R of the kind

where N and M are natural numbers depending on the form of the polynomial
P . The coefficients Ci and Dj depend on the parameters of Eq.(2.13) and on
α, β and γ. Then each nontrivial solution of the nonlinear algebraic system
(2.15)

Ci = 0, i = 1, . . . , N;

Dj = 0, j = 1, . . . , M

leads to solitary wave solution of the nonlinear partial differential equation
(2.13).
We note hat the simplest equation from the above theorem, namely fξ2 =
4(f 2 − f 3 ) has the solution f (ξ) = cosh12 (ξ) where ξ = αx + βt. In other
words the theorem gives us an information about the solitary wave solutions
of large class of nonlinear partial differential equations.
An extension of the methodology with respect to more general simplest
equation was made in [57]. There was proposed the use of the simplest
equation with polynomial nonlinearity (1.1). For the particular case k = 2 in
(1.1) and for a large class of nonlinear PDE with polynomial nonlinearity the
Modified method of simplest equation is formulated in terms of calculation
of sequences of polynomials. The methodology is applied to the generalized
8

Kortweg-de Vries equation and to second order Korteweg - de Vries equation
(called also Olver equation).
In [56] the research presented in [55] was extended for the case of simplest
equation fξ2 = n2 (f 2 − f ( 2n + 2)/n) which has the solution f (ξ) = cosh1n (ξ)
where ξ = αx + βt.
The methodology of the modified method of simplest equation based on
one simplest equation was applied in the last years for studying propagation
of waves in artery with aneurism [63] - [66].
The last modification of the modified method of simplest equation is
connected to the possibility of use of more than one simplest equation that
was applied in [67]. This modification (MMSEn - Fig. 1) is as follows. Let
us consider a nonlinear partial differential equation (2.1) where N (u, . . . )
depends on the function u(x, ..., t) and some of its derivatives participate in
(u can be a function of more than 1 spatial coordinate). The 7 steps of the
methodology of the modified method of simplest equation are as follows.
1.) We perform a transformation
(2.16)

u(x, . . . , t) = G(F (x, . . . , t))

where G(F ) is some function of another function F . In general F (x, . . . , t)
is a function of the spatial variables as well as of the time. The transformation G(F ) may be the Painleve expansion [1], [25], [36] or another
transformation, e.g., u(x, t) = 4 tan−1 [F (x, t)] for the case of the sine
- Gordon equation or u(x, t) = 4 tanh−1 [F (x, t)] for the case of shGordon (Poisson-Boltzmann equation) (for applications of the last two
transformations see, e.g. [58] - [62]). In many particular cases one
may skip this step (then we have just u(x, . . . , t) = F (x, . . . , t)) but
in numerous cases the step is necessary for obtaining a solution of the
studied nonlinear PDE. The application of Eq.(2.16) to Eq.(2.1) leads
to a nonlinear PDE for the function F (x, . . . , t).
2.) The function F (x, . . . , t) is represented as a function of other functions
f1 , . . . , fN that are connected to solutions of some differential equations
(these equations can be partial or ordinary differential equations) that
are more simple than Eq.(2.1). We note that the possible values of N
are N = 1, 2, . . . (there may be infinite number of functions f too).
The forms of the function F (f1 , . . . , fN ) can be different. One example

F = α+

where α, βi1 , γi1 ,i2 , σi1 ,...,iN . . . are parameters. We shall use Eq.(2.17)
below. Note that the relationship (2.17) contains as particular case
N
P
the relationship used by Hirota [1]. The power series
µn f n (where
i=0

µ is a parameter) used in the previous versions of the methodology of
the modified method of simplest equation are a particular case of the
relationship (2.17) too.

3.) In general the functions f1 , . . . , fN are solutions of partial differential
equations. By means of appropriate ansätze (e.g., traveling-wave ansätze
such as ξ = α̂x + β̂t; ζ = γ̂x + δ̂t, η = µ̂y + ν̂t . . . ) the solved differential equations for f1 , . . . , fN may be reduced to differential equations
El , containing derivatives of one or several functions
(2.18)

El [a(ξ), aξ , aξξ , . . . , b(ζ), bζ , bζζ , . . . ] = 0; l = 1, . . . , N

In many cases (e.g, if the equations for the functions f1 , . . . are ordinary
differential equations) one may skip this step but the step may be
necessary if the equations for f1 , . . . are partial differential equations.
4.) We assume that the functions a(ξ), b(ζ), etc., are functions of other
functions, e.g., v(ξ), w(ζ), etc., i.e.
(2.19)

a(ξ) = A[v(ξ)]; b(ζ) = B[w(ζ)]; . . .

Note that the kinds of the functions A , B, . . . are not prescribed.
Often one uses a finite-series relationship, e.g.,
(2.20)

a(ξ) =

ν2
X

qµ1 [v(ξ)]µ1 ;

b(ζ) =

ν4
X

rµ2 [w(ζ)]µ2 , . . .

µ2 =−ν3

µ1 =−ν1

where qµ1 , rµ2 , . . . are coefficients. However other kinds of relationships
may be used too.

10

5.) The functions v(ξ), w(ζ), . . . are solutions of simpler ordinary differential
equations called simplest equations. For several years the methodology
of the modified method of simplest equation was based on use of one
simplest equation. This version of the methodology allows for the use
of more than one simplest equation.
6.) The application of the steps 1.) - 5.) to Eq.(2.1) transforms the lefthand side of this equation. Let the result of this transformation be a
function that is a sum of terms where each term contains some function multiplied by a coefficient. This coefficient contains some of the
parameters of the solved equation and some of the parameters of the
solution. In the most cases a balance procedure must be applied in order to ensure that the above-mentioned relationships for the coefficients
contain more than one term ( e.g., if the result of the transformation is
a polynomial then the balance procedure has to ensure that the coefficient of each term of the polynomial is a relationship that contains at
least two terms). This balance procedure may lead to one or more additional relationships among the parameters of the solved equation and
parameters of the solution. The last relationships are called balance
equations.
7.) We may obtain a nontrivial solution of Eq. (2.1) if all coefficients mentioned in Step 6.) are set to 0. This condition usually leads to a system
of nonlinear algebraic equations for the coefficients of the solved nonlinear PDE and for the coefficients of the solution. Any nontrivial solution
of this algebraic system leads to a solution the studied nonlinear partial
differential equation. Usually the above system of algebraic equations
contains many equations that have to be solved with the help of a
computer algebra system.
The above steps of the methodology are generalization of what was used in
[67] to obtain exact traveling wave solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger
equation. We note Eq.(2.17) that represents the relationship among the
solution of the solved NPFE and the solutions of the corresponding simplest
equations. This relationship from MMSEn contains as particular case the
corresponding relationship from MMSE1 as well as the relationship used in
[1].

Concluding remarks

There exists also research on the relation between the MMSE1 and other
methods fro obtaining exact solutions of NPDEs. Results of this research
11

can be found in [68] -[71]. This research shows that MMSE1 is powerful
method for obtaining exact particular solutions of many NPDEs. The extension to MMSEn makes the methodology even more useful as it becomes
capable to obtain solutions that are more complicated in comparison to solitary waves (if such solutions do exist). The main characteristic of MMSEn is
the possibility of use of more than one simplest equation. MMSEn includes
also a possibility for a transformation connected to the searched solution. In
such a way the possibility for use of a Painleve expansion or other transformations is presented in the methodology of MMSEn. This possibility in
combination with the possibility of use of more than one simplest equation
adds the capability for obtaining multisolitons by the discussed version of
the methodology of the modified method of simplest equation. In addition
we consider the relationship (2.17) that is used to connect the solution of
the solved nonlinear partial differential equation to solutions of more simple
differential equations. The discussed version of the methodology allows for
the use of more than one balance equation too. All above opens new horizons for application of MMSEn for obtaining exact solutions of complicated
nonlinear partial differential equations.
