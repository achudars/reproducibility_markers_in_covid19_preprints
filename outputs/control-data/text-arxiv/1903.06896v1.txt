(Dated: March 19, 2019)
We present a model compound for the S=1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain composed of the
verdazyl-based complex [Zn(hfac)2 ][4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4-F)2 ]. Ab initio MO calculations indicate a predominant ferromagnetic interaction forming an S=1/2 ferromagnetic chain. The magnetic susceptibility and specific heat indicate a phase transition to an AF order owing to the finite interchain
couplings. We explain the magnetic susceptibility and magnetization curve above the phase transition temperature based on the S=1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. The magnetization curve
in the ordered phase is described by a conventional AF two-sublattice model. Furthermore, the
obtained magnetic specific heat reproduces the almost temperature-independent behavior of the
S=1/2 ferromagnetic
Heisenberg chain. In the low-temperature region, the magnetic specific heat
√
exhibits T dependence, which is attributed to the energy dispersion in the ferromagnetic chain.

INTRODUCTION

One-dimensional (1D) spin systems have been intensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically,
over the last several decades. In particular, the S = 1/2
antiferromagnetic (AF) Heisenberg chain is of fundamental importance in strongly correlated quantum manybody systems, because it is one of the few systems for
which a nontrivial ground state is precisely known. The
ground state of the S = 1/2 AF Heisenberg chain is
described by a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, which is a
quantum critical state with a k-linear energy dispersion [1]. Such linear dispersion results in the well-known
T -linear behavior of the low-temperature specific heat.
Although many examples of the S = 1/2 AF Heisenberg
chain have been reported so far, the number of examples of S = 1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain is much
smaller. Nevertheless, theoretical investigation of the S
= 1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain have been performed over many decades. The ground state is a ferromagnetic order, but there is no ordered state at any
finite temperature. Bethe demonstrated that the exact
many-body wave function of such a system can be expressed analytically [2], and Bonner and Fisher studied
the thermodynamic properties [3]. Takahashi explained
the low-temperature thermodynamic properties by using
the modified spin-wave approximation [4]. It is confirmed
that the magnetic susceptibility diverges as T −2 with decreasing temperature√and that the low-temperature specific heat exhibits a T dependence associated with the
k 2 dependence of the energy dispersion [5–8]. In the case
of an actual quasi-1D ferromagnetic system, theoretical
study suggests that predominant 1D ferromagnetic inter-

actions realize a dimensional crossover of Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) [9].
From the experimental point of view, several Cu complexes have been actively investigated as the best realizations of the S = 1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain
mainly in the 1980s [10–12]. In (C6 H11 NH3 )CuX3 (X=Cl
and Br), the almost temperature-independent specific
heats are well explained by using
√ ferromagnetic chain
models, while low-temperature T dependence is not
observed due to the appearance of large peaks associated with the phase transition to long-range-order
(LRO) [12]. Neutron scattering studies on these Cu
complexes demonstrated the k 2 dependence of the spinwave dispersion in the chain direction [13, 14]. Although
these Cu complexes have strong ferromagnetic chain
interactions, their magnetic properties exhibit slightly
anisotropic behavior. Thus, organic radical compounds
with isotropic nature owing to orbital quenching have
attracted interest as a model system of ferromagnetic
Heisenberg chain. From the 1990s, several organic radical compounds, e.g. β-p-NPNN, γ-p-NPNN, BImNN,
F4BImNN, and β-BBDTA-GaBr4 , have been reported
to form the S = 1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain [15–
22]. Their magnetic properties in the ordered phase and
vicinity of the phase transition temperature are examined
in connection with the pursuit for organic magnet.
In order to design Heisenberg spin systems, we have
also focused on organic radical compounds. One of the
suitable candidates is verdazyl radical, which can exhibit a delocalized π-electron spin density in nonplanar
molecular structures. The flexibility of the molecular orbitals in the verdazyl radical offers tunability of the intermolecular magnetic interactions by molecular design.
Recently, we demonstrated that the verdazyl radical can

2
form a variety of unconventional S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin
systems, such as the quantum pentagon, random honeycomb, and fully-frustrated square lattice, which have not
been realized in conventional inorganic materials [23–25].
Furthermore, in contrast to conventional organic radical
systems, the verdazyl radical facilitates the formation of
ferromagnetic interactions, and thus we have realized a
variety of S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin systems with 1D ferromagnetic interactions [26–28]. For instance, antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic chains form a twodimensional honeycomb lattice in 2-Cl-6-F-V [27], and
the frustrated square lattice in (o-MePy-V)PF6 contains
alternating ferromagnetic chains [28]. In 3-I-V, which
forms a spin ladder with a predominant ferromagneticleg interaction, quasi-1D BEC was actually observed near
the saturation field [29].
In this paper, we present a new verdazyl-based
complex. We successfully synthesized single crystals
of [Zn(hfac)2 ][4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4-F)2 ] [hfac = 1,1,1,5,5,5hexafluoroacetylacetonate, 4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4-F)2 = 3-(4Cl-2-pyridyl)-1,5-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-diphenylverdazyl].
Ab initio molecular orbital (MO) calculations indicate
that a predominant ferromagnetic interaction forms an
S=1/2 ferromagnetic chain. The magnetic susceptibility
and specific heat show a phase transition to an AF order
owing to the finite AF interchain couplings. We explain
the magnetic susceptibility, magnetization curve, and
magnetic specific heat above the phase transition temperature based on the S=1/2 ferromagnetic
Heisenberg
√
chain. Furthermore, we observe T dependence of the
magnetic specific heat in the low-temperature region.

were measured using a commercial SQUID magnetometer (MPMS-XL, Quantum Design) above 1.8 K and a
capacitive Faraday magnetometer with a dilution refrigerator down to 80 mK. The experimental results were corrected for the diamagnetic contribution of −1.65×10−4
emu mol−1 , which is determined based on the QMC analysis to be described and close to that calculated by Pascalfs method. The specific heat was measured with a
commercial calorimeter (PPMS, Quantum Design) using a thermal relaxation method above 1.9 K and a
handmade apparatus by a standard adiabatic heat-pulse
method with a dilution refrigerator down to about ∼70
mK. There is no significant difference in magnetic properties between the field directions owing to the isotropic
g value of ∼2.00 in verdazyl radical systems. Therefore,
all experiments were performed using small randomly oriented single crystals.
Ab initio MO calculations were performed using the
UB3LYP method with the basis set 6-31G in the Gaussian 09 program package. The convergence criterion was
set at 10−8 hartree. For the estimation of intermolecular
magnetic interaction, we applied our evaluation scheme
that have been studied previously [32].
The QMC code is based on the directed loop algorithm
in the stochastic series expansion representation [33].
The calculations for the S = 1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain was performed for N = 1024 under the periodic boundary condition, where N denotes the system
size. It was confirmed that there is no significant sizedependent effect. All calculations were carried out using
the ALPS application [34, 35].

EXPERIMENTAL AND NUMERICAL
METHOD
A.

We synthesized 4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4-F)2 through a conventional procedure for verdazyl radical [30]. A solution of
[Zn(hfac)2 ]·2H2 O (510 mg, 0.99 mmol) in 15 ml of heptane was refluxed at 60◦ C. A solution of 4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4F)2 (380 mg, 0.99 mmol) in 2 ml of CH2 Cl2 was slowly
added, and stirring was continued for 1 h. After the
mixed solution cooled to room temperature, a dark-green
crystalline solid of [Zn(hfac)2 ][4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4-F)2 ] was
separated by filtration and washed with heptane. The
dark-green residue was recrystallized using acetonitrile
at 10◦ C.
Single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment
was performed by using a diffractometer with an imaging plate (R-AXIS RAPID, Rigaku) with graphitemonochromated Mo-Kα radiation at room temperature.
The single crystal XRD data are refined by using the
SHELX software [31]. The structural refinement was carried out using anisotropic and isotropic thermal parameters for the nonhydrogen atoms and the hydrogen atoms,
respectively. All the hydrogen atoms were placed at the
calculated ideal positions
The magnetic susceptibility and magnetization curves

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Crystal structure and magnetic model

The crystallographic data for the synthesized
[Zn(hfac)2 ][4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4-F)2 ] are summarized in Table
I, and the molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). The
verdazyl ring (which includes four N atoms), the upper
two phenyl rings, and the bottom pyridine ring are
labeled R1 , R2 , R3 , and R4 , respectively. The dihedral
angles of R1 -R2 , R1 -R3 , R1 -R4 are approximately
9◦ , 51◦ , and 9◦ , respectively. Each molecule has a
delocalized S=1/2. The result of the MO calculation
for [Zn(hfac)2 ][4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4-F)2 ] molecule indicate
that approximately 61 % of the total spin density is
present on R1 . Further, while R2 and R3 each account
for approximately 14 % and 18 % of the relatively large
total spin density, R4 accounts for less than 7 % of
the total spin density. Therefore, the intermolecular
interactions are caused by the short contacts related to
the R1 , R2 , and R3 rings. Since Zn(hfac)2 has a low spin
density less than 1 % of the total spin density, it works
as a spacer between verdazyl radicals, resulting in the
low dimensionality of the spin model. We focus on the
structural features related to the 4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4-F)2 to

consider intermolecular interactions.
We evaluated the intermolecular exchange interactions
of all molecular pairs within 4.0 Å through the ab initio
MO calculations and found one predominant ferromagnetic interaction. Its value was evaluated as J/kB =
−10.7 K, which is defined
P in the Heisenberg
Pspin Hamiltonian given by H = J <i,j> S i ·S j , where <i,j> denotes
the sum over the neighboring spin pairs. The molecular
pair associated with this interaction is related by an aglide reflection symmetry and has N-C short contact of
3.51 Å, as shown in Figs. 1(b) and (c). Accordingly, a
uniform S = 1/2 ferromagnetic chain is formed by the
expected interaction J along the a-axis, as shown in Fig.
1(d). The Zn(hfac)2 acts as a spacer between the 1D
chains, as shown in Fig. 1(e). The other intermolecular interactions associated with interchain couplings are
evaluated to be less than approximately 1/100 of J in
absolute values, which enhances the 1D character of the
present spin model. Considering strong dependence on
the calculation method and basis set in the MO calculation, such small interchain couplings do not have enough
reliability [36], and thus we evaluate the effective interchain couplings through a mean-field analysis of the experimental results, as discussed later.

is followed, χ = C/(T − θW ). The estimated Curie constant is about C = 0.373 emu· K/mol, which is close to
the expected value for noninteracting S = 1/2 spins, and
the Weiss temperature is estimated to be θW = 3.2 K.
Below 0.7 K, χT decreases with decreasing temperature,
indicating the existence of additional weak AF interactions. Furthermore, we observe a discontinuous change
in χ at 0.31 K, which indicates a phase transition to a
three-dimensional LRO. In the ordered phase, χ becomes
almost temperature independent, which suggests that a
spin-flop transition field is lower than 0.05 T as will be
discussed later. As shown in the lower inset of Fig. 2,
the discontinuous change shifts to a lower temperature at
a higher field of 0.1 T, which indicates that the ordered
state is an AF ordering of the ferromagnetic chains.
The MO calculations show the formation of the S =
1/2 ferromagnetic chain, and the one-dimensionality is
enhanced owing to the almost nonmagnetic Zn(hfac)2
between the chain structures. Accordingly, we calculated the magnetic susceptibility χQMC for the S =
1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain by using the QMC
method. Given the radical-based compound, we assume
the isotropic g-value of 2.00. The experimental result
exhibits the contribution of weak AF interchain interactions as represented by the broad peak of χT , and thus
we consider an AF mean field to reproduce the observed
behavior. The mean-field approximation is represented
as:
χQMC
χ=
(1)
1 + (zJ 0 /N g 2 µ2B )χQMC
where z is the number of nearest-neighbor spins, J 0 is
the interchain exchange interaction, N is the number
of spins, and µB is the Bohr magneton. We obtained
good agreement between the experimental and calculated
resluts above the phase transition temperature, including
the broad peak of χT , by using the parameters J/kB =
−8.8 K and zJ 0 /kB = 0.32 K, as shown in Fig. 2 and its
upper inset. A clear AF contribution can be confirmed
by comparing the calculated results of the isolated ferromagnetic chain and the ferromagnetic chain with the
AF mean field, as shown in Fig. 2 and its upper inset.
The Weiss temperature for the 1D chain is given by θW
= −2JS(S + 1)/3kB from the mean-field approximation,
and we obtaine θW = 4.4 K, which is close to the evaluation from the Curie-Weiss fitting.

Magnetic susceptibility

@ Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the
magnetic susceptibility (χ = M/H) at 0.05 T. The contribution of JF appears in the temperature dependence of
χT , which increases with decreasing temperatures down
to approximately 0.7 K, as shown in the upper inset of
Fig. 2. At temperature above 2 K, the Curie-Weiss law

Magnetization curve

Figure 3(a) shows the magnetization curve at 1.8 K
above the phase transition temperature. The saturation
value of 0.96 µB /f.u. indicates that the purity of the radicals is approximately 96 %. The dominant ferromagnetic
contribution can be confirmed by comparing the observed
result and the Brillouin function for free S = 1/2 spins,
and the experimental result is well explained by the S =
1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with J/kB = −8.8 K,

as shown in Fig. 3(a). The slight deviation is considered
to originate from the contribution of weak AF interchain
interactions as in the case of the magnetic susceptibility.
Figure 3(b) shows the magnetization curve at 0.08 K.
The samples used are the same as those for the magnetic
susceptibility, and the experimental result corresponds to
the magnetization in the AF ordered phase. We observe
an almost linear increase with increasing fields up to approximately 0.15 T. The observed linear increase at 0.08
K indicates that the magnetic behavior in the ordered
phase can be described by a classical AF two-sublattice
model, in which the spins on each ferromagnetic chain
form one sublattice moment. The colinear two-sublattice
is aligned along the easy-axis under zero-field conditions.
For the external field parallel to the the easy-axis, the discontinuous spin-flop phase transition occurs at a certain
field. Above the spin-flop transition field, two sublattices
are tilted to the field direction with equivalent angles. For
the external field perpendicular to the easy-axis, two sublattices are tilted from the easy-axis with equivalent. In
the present case, we have not observed anomalous behavior associated with the spin-flop transition in the magnetization curve of randomly oriented single crystals. Thus,
the transition field can be evaluated to be less than 0.01
T, which is consistent with the small magnetic anisotropy
in the organic radical systems. The magnetization curve

becomes almost identical for any field direction above the
spin-flop phase transition, yielding the almost temperature independent behavior of the magnetic susceptibility
at 0.05 T in the ordered phase. Accordingly, we can consider an isotropic spin system for the analysis even in
the ordered phase. Two sublattices are coupled by the
AF interchain interactions, and a mean-field approximation gives the magnetization curve at T = 0, expressed as:
Mmean = g 2 µB H/2zJ 0 , where H is the external magnetic
field. We obtained good agreement between the experimental and calculated results by using zJ 0 /kB = 0.21 K
(as shown in Fig. 3(b)), which is close to the value obtained from the analysis of the magnetic susceptibility.

D.

Specific heat

The experimental results for the specific heat Cp at
zero-field clearly exhibit a λ-type sharp peak, which is
associated with the phase transition to the AF LRO, as
shown in Fig. 4(a). Because we used different samples
from those used for the magnetization measurements, the
phase transition slightly shifts to a lower temperature.
We ascribe this disparity to a high sensitivity of the interchain couplings to the purity of the radicals and/or
slight impurities. We evaluated the magnetic specific

of χT . The solid lines with open circles and open squares

chain and the ferromagnetic chain with the AF mean field,

heat Cm by subtracting the lattice contribution Cl and
assumed Cl in the low-temperature region approximated
as: Cl = a1 T 3 + a2 T 5 + a3 T 7 . The constants a1 − a3
are determined to reproduce the following magnetic specific heat calculated by the QMC method. As a result,
Cl with the constants a1 = 0.12, a2 = −3.6 × 10−3 , and
a3 = 5.7 × 10−5 was evaluated. The value of a1 corresponds to a Debye temperature of 25 K, which is not
very different from those for other verdazyl radical compounds, but is a slightly smaller value [26, 27]. This
small Debye temperature reduces the applicable temperature region of the Debye’s T 3 law, and thus we had to
also consider T 5 and T 7 terms to evaluate the magnetic
specific heat up to approximately 5 K. The smaller value
of Debye temperature is consistent with the molecular
arrangement of the present compound, in which there
is no large overlap of molecular orbitals causing strong
AF coupling. We calculated the magnetic specific heat
for the S = 1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with
J/kB = −8.8 K by using the QMC method and obtained
good agreement between the experiment and calculation
above the phase transition temperature, as shown in Fig.
4(a). Here, we confirm that the calculated specific heat
is consistent with those reported in previous theoretical
works [3, 6–8].
The phase transition temperature decreases with increasing field, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Such field depen-

dence of the phase transition temperature is consistent
with that for χ and also indicates the AF LRO. At 0.03
and 0.1 T, the phase transition temperature becomes
lower than the experimental temperature, but the magnetization curve indicates that the spins are not fully polarized yet. Thus, we expect that the low-temperature specific heat above 0.03 T arises from the gapless 1D ferromagnetic dispersion. As shown in the inset of Fig.4(a), in
the low-temperature region, the magnetic
specific heats
√
at 0.03 T and 0.1 T actually show T behavior, which
clearly demonstrates the contribution of k 2 dispersion in
1D ferromagnetic chain [3, 6–8].

SUMMARY

We successfully synthesized single crystals of the
verdazyl-based complex [Zn(hfac)2 ][4-Cl-o-Py-V-(4-F)2 ].
Ab initio MO calculations indicated the formation of
an S=1/2 ferromagnetic chain. The magnetic susceptibility and specific heat indicated a phase transition to
an AF order owing to weak interchain interactions, and
the low-temperature magnetization curve exhibited a lin-

6
ear increase. We explained the magnetic susceptibility
above the phase transition temperature on the basis of
the S=1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with an AF
mean field by combining the QMC method and meanfield approximation. The magnetization curve in the ordered phase was described by the conventional AF twosublattice model considering the AF interchain couplings.
Furthermore, we reproduced the almost temperatureindependent magnetic specific heat for the S=1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg
√ chain. In the low-temperature
region, we observed T dependence of the magnetic specific heat, which indicates the contribution of k 2 dispersion in the 1D ferromagnetic chain.
