Multimode entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information in continuous-variable
systems. Light-based quantum technologies will arguably not be built upon table-top bulk setups,
but will presumably rather resort to integrated optics. Sequential bulk optics-like proposals based
on cascaded integrated interferometers are not scalable with the current state-of-the-art low-loss materials used for continuous variables. We analyze the multimode continuous-variable entanglement
capabilities of a compact currently-available integrated device without bulk-optics analog: the array
of nonlinear waveguides. We theoretically demonstrate that this simple and compact structure,
together with a reconfigurable input pump distribution and multimode coherent detection of the
output modes, is a versatile entanglement synthesizer in the spatial domain. We exhibit this versatility through analytical and numerically optimized multimode squeezing, entanglement, and cluster
state generation in different encodings. Our results re-establish spatial encoding as a contender in
the game of continuous-variable quantum information processing.

INTRODUCTION

Two key phenomena underpin current quantum technologies: quantum superposition and quantum correlations –entanglement– [1]. The paradigmatic example of
entanglement is the case of two spatially separated quantum particles that have both maximally correlated momenta and maximally anticorrelated positions [2]. Position and momentum are continuous variables (CV), i.e.
variables that take a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues.
In the optical domain CV-based quantum information
can be encoded in the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field quadratures [3]. Features like deterministic
resources, unconditional operations and near-unity efficiency homodyne detectors make CV a powerful framework for the development of quantum technologies [4].
Remarkably, entanglement between more than two parties is also useful. Large-scale CV entangled states are
the resources of a promising class of quantum computing:
measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) [5, 6].
A recent breakthrough generating large two-dimensional
cylindrical-array clusters positions CV as a frontrunner
in the race after a photonic quantum computer [7, 8].
Multipartite entangled states are up to now produced
in table-top experiments with specific designs generating
only specific entanglement geometries or quantum networks: recent demonstration of large-scale entanglement
include frequency [9], temporal [10] and spatial [11–13]
encoding of squeezed light.

glement synthesizer– is a challenging task. Entanglement synthesizers are key for applications in quantum
computing and quantum simulation [14, 15]. Transverse
laser modes and frequency modes entanglement synthesizers based respectively on postprocessing measurement
results and on measurement basis shaping have been introduced in [16–18]. These supermode-based approaches
are interesting for engineering quantum states and simulating complex quantum systems. They are however not
fully equivalent to a quantum network, since the quantum information can only be processed locally, but not
in a distributed way. Recently, an entanglement synthesizer with the possibility to distribute the nodes has
been introduced in the time domain [19]. A versatile
entanglement synthesizer in the spatial domain is nevertheless still missing. Specifically, spatial distribution
of signal in networks is naturally accomplished in this
domain and this is highly desirable for applications in
secure communications via quantum secret sharing [20]
or in distributed quantum sensing [21]. In this work we
introduce the monolithic array of waveguides with builtin nonlinearity as a versatile spatial-mode squeezing and
entanglement synthesizer.
We propose to take advantage of integrated optics, a
solution for the blooming of market-scalable quantumoptics technologies [22]. Spatial encoding is a natural
framework in integrated optics where the information is
encoded in the propagating waveguided modes and transmitted by optical fibers. A source of CV entangled states
fully on-chip has been introduced recently [23]. However,
the extension of that scheme of sequential squeezing and
entanglement –via nonlinear waveguides and directional
couplers, respectively– to a number of modes N > 2 is
very demanding with current technology. We establish
here that the array of nonlinear waveguides (ANW) –
that interlaces nonlinearity and evanescent coupling, i.e.

FIG. 1. Sketch of our versatile entanglement synthesizer based on an array of nonlinear waveguides (ANW) made up of five
PPLN waveguides working in a SPDC configuration (not at scale). A single laser with a second harmonic generation stage
outputs coherent pump and local oscillator (LO) beams. A reconfigurable multimode shaper composed by a 1 × N fiber beam
~ in the array through
splitter (f-bs), attenuators (Attj ) and phase shifters (φj ) at pump frequency inputs the desired profile (~
η , φ)
a V-groove array. Bent waveguides conduct the pump modes to the periodically poled ANW (dashed box) where signal modes
are generated and evanescently coupled. The coupling profile f~, wavevector phasematching and coupling phasematching can be
suitably engineered for a specific operation mode. The output light is collected by V-groove arrays and directed to a multimode
balanced homodyne detector (BHD). The multimode LO shaper is composed by attenuators (Attj ) and phase shifters (θj ).
Each independent BHD mixes LO and SPDC light in a balanced f-bs and the result is measured by a pair of photodiodes.
The currents yielded by photodiodes are subtracted two by two and the generated electric signals are then electronically mixed
(postprocessed) if necessary. Access to the individual mode basis is achieved simply using independent LOs. Access to the
~ and amplitude profiles (see sections
supermode bases involves shaping the LO in every single supermode through LO phase (θ)
III B and V B).

interlaces squeezing and entanglement, in a monolithic
way (Figure 1)– is a good contender for versatile and
scalable generation of entanglement. CV entanglement
generation in monolithic ANW is thus paradigmatically
different from the current sequential bulk-optics-inspired
schemes [11–13]. Nonclassical biphoton states for applications in the discrete-variable (DV) regime have been
demonstrated in such waveguide arrays [24, 25]. On-chip
DV cluster states have been recently demonstrated and
proposed in a bulk-optics-inspired scheme and the ANW,
respectively [26, 27]. Bipartite and tripartite CV entanglement have been predicted in arrays of nonlinear waveguides in the spontaneous (SPDC) and stimulated parametric downconversion regime [28]. Nevertheless, tripartite entanglement was only predicted there for critical
values of the involved parameters. We have proposed recently a scalable approach to generate multipartite entanglement in arrays of nonlinear waveguides in the second
harmonic generation regime [29]. We show here that,
in the experimentally relevant regime of SPDC, reconfigurable multimode pump and measurement, and freedom of choice of basis encoding enable on-demand programmability of entanglement. We theoretically demonstrate the versatility of our approach in the production of multimode squeezing, multipartite entanglement
and cluster states, through analytical and numerical so-

lutions, applying optimization strategies. Remarkably,
since the encoding of quantum information is mode basisdependent, we present two cluster-state-generation procedures: i) entanglement generation among individual
modes of the waveguides, and ii) entanglement generation among the elements of optimized nonlocal bases of
the array. We thus demonstrate that our photonic entanglement synthesizer can operate in the two regimes
pioneered in free space CV respectively in i) [11–13] and
ii) [16–18]. We review the possible applications in each
case.
The article is organized as follows: in section II we
introduce the theoretical model for the ANW. In section III we develop and solve the propagation equations
in three relevant encoding bases: individual modes, linear and nonlinear supermodes. We propose methods of
detection in each basis. We then exhibit in all bases unoptimized generation of multimode squeezing using one
analytical solution related to a specific pumping profile.
We conclude summarizing the main features of each encoding basis. In section IV we analyze the optimized
generation of multipartite entanglement in the individual mode basis. In section V we focus on the versatile
generation of cluster states both in terms of their geometry and encoding. Finally, in section VI we discuss on the
different mode-basis encoding and point at applications,

3
we present future research directions for our synthesizer,
and we analyze the feasibility of our approach.
II.

THE ARRAY OF NONLINEAR
WAVEGUIDES

The array of nonlinear waveguides consists of N identical single-mode χ(2) waveguides in which degenerate
SPDC and nearest-neighbor evanescent coupling between
the generated fields take place. The array can be made
up of, for instance, periodically poled lithium niobate
(PPLN) waveguides as sketched in Figure 1 (dashed box).
In each waveguide, an input harmonic field at frequency
ωh is type-0 downconverted (same polarization modes)
into a signal field at frequency ωs [30]. We consider
pump undepletion with αh,j a strong coherent pump field
propagating in the jth waveguide. We consider that the
phase matching condition ∆β ≡ β(ωh ) − 2β(ωs ) = 0,
with β(ωh,s ) the propagation constant at frequency ωh,s ,
is fulfilled only in the coupling zone. The energy of
the signal modes propagating in each waveguide is exchanged between the coupled waveguides through evanescent waves, whereas the interplay of the second harmonic
waves is negligible for the considered propagation lengths
due to their high confinement into the guiding region. We
consider a general inhomogeneous array of N identical
waveguides and continuous-wave propagating fields. The
physical processes involved are described by the following
system of equations [28, 31]
dÂj
= iC0 (fj−1 Âj−1 + fj Âj+1 ) + 2iηj Â†j ,
dz

(1)

where Â0 = 0 and ÂN +1 = 0, f0 = fN = 0 and
j = 1, . . . , N is the individual mode index. Âj ≡
Âj (z, ωs ) are monochromatic slowly-varying amplitude
annihilation operators of signal (s) photons corresponding to the jth waveguide where [Âj (z, ω), Â†j 0 (z, ω 0 )] =
δ(ω − ω 0 )δj,j 0 . Âj are thus the annihilation operators
in the individual mode basis. ηj = g αh,j ≡ |ηj | eiφj is
the effective nonlinear coupling constant corresponding
to the jth waveguide, with g the nonlinear constant proportional to χ(2) and the spatial overlap of the signal and
harmonic fields in each waveguide. Cj = C0 fj is the linear coupling constant between modes j and j + 1, and
z is the coordinate along the direction of propagation.
Both the coupling and nonlinear constants depend on
the signal frequency, C0 ≡ C0 (ωs ) and g ≡ g(ωs ). In the
following, we set them as real without loss of generality.
The ANW presents a large number of governing parameters that can be engineered to fit a desired operation and application. There are two types of parameters according to our ability to reconfigure them: i)
the evanescent coupling profile f~ = (f1 , . . . , fN −1 ) [32–
35], the length of the sample L, the number of waveguides N –and notably its parity–, and the wavevector
and coupling periodical inversion periods (Λ∆β , ΛC ) in

quasi-phase matched structures [36, 37] which can not
be tuned once the sample is fabricated. In contrast with
ii) the power and phase pump profile, given respectively
~ = (arg (η1 ), . . . , arg (ηN )),
by ~η = (|η1 |, . . . , |ηN |) and φ
the coupling strength C0 (ωs ) [38] and the basis of detection [18] which can be set according to a required operation and encoding of information. The large number of
degrees of freedom available in a compact device is the
main advantage of the ANW with respect to other approaches in the generation of multimode entangled states
[12, 13]. We demonstrate in this paper how to use these
tunable parameters to generate CV multipartite entanglement and cluster states.
To that end, we first need to solve the propagation in
the ANW. Equation (1) can be solved numerically for a
specific set of parameters Cj , ηj and N , or even analytically if N is small. However, it is difficult to gain physical
insight from numerical or low-dimension analytical solutions due to the increasing complexity of the system with
the number of waveguides. The problem of propagation
in ANW is simplified by using the eigenmodes of the corresponding linear array of waveguides –the linear or propagation supermodes [39]. These linear supermodes are especially useful as an intermediate step to diagonalize the
evolution of the system and they are used throughout
section III. These supermodes are coupled through the
nonlinearity. We find a further simplification by using the
eigenmodes of the full nonlinear system –the nonlinear or
squeezing supermodes [40]–, which are squeezed and fully
decoupled but local (z-dependent). Thus, we use three
complementary and useful bases in ANW: the individual
mode A, the linear supermode B and the nonlinear supermode C bases. Quantum information can be naturally
encoded in any of the three bases. A suitable implementation of the detection provides access to a given encoding
[41]. Below we give general solutions to the propagation
problem in the three bases, discuss the methods of detection suitable for each basis/encoding, present an example
with an analytical solution and summarize the main features of the three encoding strategies.

A.

GENERATION AND DETECTION OF
MULTIMODE SQUEEZED STATES

Propagation solution in the individual mode
and supermode bases

We derive below the general solutions to the propagation in ANW and present the different available detection
methods depending on the encoding strategy. Considering coupling only between nearest-neighbour waveguides,
a linear waveguide array (Equation (1) with ηj = 0)
presents supermodes B, i.e. propagation eigenmodes. In
general, any linear waveguide array is represented by a
Hermitian tridiagonal matrix –Jacobi matrix– with nonnegative entries and thus by a set of non-degenerate
eigenvalues and eigenvectors given in terms of orthogonal

4
polynomials [39, 42, 43]. These eigenvectors (linear supermodes) form a basis and are represented by an orthogonal matrix M ≡ M (f~) with real elements Mk,j . The
individual mode and linear supermode bases are related
PN
by B̂k = j=1 Mk,j Âj . The supermodes are orthonorPN
mal j=1 Mk,j Mk0 ,j = δk,k0 , and the spectrum of eigenvalues is λk ≡ λk (C0 , f~). We label the supermodes in
a descending order with respect to their eigenvalue. We
focus on the relevant case of homogeneous coupling along
propagation, i.e. Cj does not depend on z. Using slowlyvarying supermode amplitudes B̂k = B̂k e−iλk z and the
orthonormality property, the following equation for the
linear propagation supermodes is obtained

Υ(z) [ 0 L(z 0 )dz 0 ] ΥT (z) = Λ(z), with Λ(z) a real diagonal matrix with non-negative entries [49]. Equation (4)
in terms of nonlinear supermodes is thus simply given by
†
Cˆm (z) = cosh[rm (z)] Cˆm (0) + sinh[rm (z)] Cˆm
(0),

(5)

where rm (z) = Λm,m (z) are the downconversion gains at
a propagation distance z. Each local nonlinear supermode thus appears as a single-mode squeezed state. The
z-dependence of the nonlinear supermodes is a trademark
of the ANW. The evanescent coupling indeed produces
a phase mismatch between the pump and the generated
signal waves which results in a z-dependent interaction.
This coupling-based phase mismatch affects the amount
of squeezing and entanglement generated in the ANW.
The relation between the nonlinear supermodes and the
individual modes is the following

L(z) is a complex symmetric matrix which gathers the
information about the spatial shape of the pump, i.e.
amplitudes and phases in each waveguide, and the propagation supermodes coupling.
Equation (2) is ubiquitous in the context of multimode
squeezing [40, 41]. In other approaches the coupling matrix is however constant along propagation, i.e. L does
not depend on z [44]. z-dependence is a unique feature of
the ANW. The general solution to Equation (2) has thus
to take into account space-ordering effects when necessary [45]. For instance, in single-pass z-dependent PDC,
for gains generating squeezing above 12 dB [46]. However, space-ordering effects can be neglected here since i)
a low-gain regime –small |ηj |– is crucial for individualmode entanglement, indeed the light generated in each
waveguide remains guided without coupling if |ηj | > C0
[47], ii) our starting point Equation (1) is correct for
small values of C0 since next-to-nearest neighbor evanescent coupling should be included for large values of C0
[39], and iii) we study SPDC generated from vacuum
where space-ordering corrections start at the third order
–roughly as O(|ηj |3 )[48]. The formal solution to Equation (2) in this regime can thus be written as

This expression encapsulates the mechanisms at play in
the ANW: the evanescent coupling generates the linear supermodes (Mk,j ) which get a phase due to propagation (λk z) and the nonlinearity couples them locally
(Υ†m,k (z)). In terms of the individual modes, the solution
to the nonlinear system is thus

Equations (4), (5) and (7) are the general solutions to
the propagation problem in ANW in the linear supermodes, nonlinear supermodes and individual mode bases,
respectively. These three solutions represent a resource
for encoding quantum information. Our results generalize those previously obtained in driven quantum walks in
ANW [24, 25, 50].
Since we are interested in CV squeezing and entanglement, we will also use along the paper the field quadratures x̂j , ŷj , where x̂j = (Âj + Â†j ) and ŷj = i(Â†j − Âj )
are, respectively, the amplitude and phase quadratures
corresponding to a signal optical mode in the individual mode basis A. Field quadratures for the linear B
and nonlinear C supermodes are defined in a similar
way. In the basis of individual modes, with quadratures ξˆ = (x̂1 , . . . , x̂N , ŷ1 , . . . , ŷN )T , the general solution
ˆ = S(z) ξ(0),
ˆ
of Equation (7) can be written as ξ(z)
with
S(z) a symplectic matrix which contains all the information about the propagation of the quantum state of
the system. The quantum states generated in ANW are
Gaussian. The most interesting observables in Gaussian
CV are the second-order moments of the quadrature operators, properly arranged in the covariance matrix V
[51]. For a quantum state initially in vacuum, the covariance matrix at any plane z is given by V (z) = S(z) S T (z),

5
with 1 the value of the shot noise related to each quadrature in our notation. Evolution of variances V (ξi , ξi ) and
quantum correlations V (ξi , ξj ) can be obtained at any
length from the elements of this matrix. The covariance
matrix can be written in the following way
V (z) = R1 (z)K 2 (z)R1T (z),

Detection schemes

The measurement of quantum noise variances and correlations is carried out by multimode balanced homodyne
detection (BHD) and access to the quantum information
encoded in the individual or any of the supermode bases
depends on a suitable BHD realization [41]. Our photonic
entanglement synthesizer is certainly compatible with a
fully fibered implementation of detection via off-the-shelf
telecom components as shown in Figure 1 [53].
The three different bases where quantum information
can be naturally encoded in the ANW correspond to different choice and engineering of LOs in multimode BHD:
i) In the individual mode basis each LO is independent.
Only two detectors are necessary in order to completely
characterize any multimode quantum state. The variance measured in each mode and the quantum correlations between any pair of modes allow to reconstruct the
full covariance matrix associated to the generated quantum state. Beyond quantum state tomography, to perform a quantum information protocol, it is necessary to
use the same number of LOs and detectors in the multimode BHD as the number of modes involved in the protocol. ii) The detection in an arbitrary supermode basis
is based on the combination of the SPDC output fields
with a spatially reconfigurable multimode local oscillator (LO shaper in Figure 1), a spatial analogue to what
has been pioneered in the spectral domain in [18]. The
LO shaper sets the relative amplitudes and phases of the
multimode LO to select a given supermode, and a controllable global phase (θ0 in Figure 1) selects the quadrature to be measured [54, 55]. This shaped LO can indeed
be set successively as the elements of a supermode basis
enabling the measurement of the full covariance matrix
in that basis. This measurement method can be implemented in fibered or in bulk optics through respectively
fibered multimode BHD or bulk-optics single-mode BHD

with a spatially shaped LO. We outline that every pump
configuration and length of the sample L produces a different nonlinear supermode basis as stated by Equation
(6). Thus, the detection basis has to be reconfigured for
every pump distribution when this encoding strategy is
selected. Our theoretical model is hence crucial to decide operation and fabrication parameters of the ANW
so that it provides a sought-after operation.

C.

Example: squeezing in the three mode bases for
a flat pump profile

Suitable manipulation of individual power and phase
pump fields by means of off-the-shelf elements as fiber
attenuators and phase shifters, and V-groove arrays linking the fiber-optics elements to the ANW enable an ondemand pump distribution engineering (Figure 1). The
pump profile couples the propagation supermodes generating the joint-spatial supermode distribution given by
Equation (3). In general, this generates complicated connections between the linear supermodes. However, the
orthogonality and symmetry properties of the linear supermodes lead to analytical solutions in some cases. An
outstanding simplification of the system is obtained when
pumping all the waveguides with the same power and
phase, which we refer to as the flat pump profile. We
show below the features of this configuration in the three
bases:
a. Linear supermode basis. When all waveguides are
equally pumped such that ηj = η, the Equation (3) is
notably simplified to Lk,k0 (z) = 2i η δk,k0 exp{−i(λk +
λk0 )z}, where we have used the orthonormality of the
linear supermodes. This pump configuration diagonalizes
the joint-spatial distribution making every linear supermode independently squeezed. The solution of Equation
(2) in terms of linear supermodes Bk can then be written
as
sin(Fk z)
[λk B̂k (0) + 2η B̂k† (0)],
Fk
(9)
p
with Fk = λ2k − 4|η|2 . This solution is exact for any
gain regime [45]. It generalizes the solution found for the
nonlinear directional coupler (N = 2) in ref. [56] and remains valid for any number of waveguides N , evanescent
coupling profile f~, and propagation distance z. Note that
Equation (9) for |λk | > 2|η| and |λk | < 2|η| are, respectively, the solutions of a non-phase-matched and phasematched degenerate parametric amplifiers [57]. For typical evanescent coupling, nonlinearities and pump powers found in quadratic ANW, Fk is real for the majority of supermodes. In this case, the kth propagation
supermode periodically oscillates between a maximum
and zero with oscillation periods Lk = π/(2Fk ). The
period Lk depends on the pump power and, markedly,
on the evanescent coupling profile f~ through λk . Interestingly, waveguide arrays with odd number of identical
B̂k (z) = cos(Fk z)B̂k (0) + i

6
waveguides N exhibit a propagation eigenmode with zero
eigenvalue λ(N +1)/2 = 0 [42]. This supermode is phasematched all along the propagation and its squeezing is
maximum [58].
We exhibit the features discussed above with a specific example in an array with N = 5 waveguides. Figure
2a shows the evolution of maximum linear supermode
squeezing [V (yk (θk ), y(θk )) < 1] over a generalized phase
quadrature yk (θk ) [59]. We set the kth LO phase as θk (z)
maximizing the kth linear supermode squeezing [45]. We
set |η| = 0.015 mm−1 , a realistic value comparable with
that obtained in ref. [23]. We choose a homogeneous
coupling profile fj = 1. The propagation constants related to each propagation supermode with this coupling
profile are λk = 2C0 cos[kπ/(N + 1)] [39]. We show the
effect of the coupling strength C0 on the squeezing with
three different cases: 0.08 mm−1 (dashed), 0.24 mm−1
(solid), and 0.72 mm−1 (dotted). The k = 3 supermode
is the only nondegenerate one (green). It is independent
of the value of C0 , builds up continuously and is efficiently
squeezed. The amount of squeezing is degenerate two by
two for the other supermodes. The maximum squeezing
in these supermodes (k = 1, 5 in blue, k = 2, 4 in orange)
decreases as the coupling strength C0 increases.
The properties of the linear supermodes thus give insight about the properties of the squeezed light generated
in the array in this pump configuration. We have found
and analyzed similar analytical solutions for other pump
configurations in this basis [45].
b. Nonlinear supermode basis. The flat pump configuration diagonalizes directly the system in the linear
supermode basis. After an appropriate phase-space rotation, carried out by the LO in the multimode BHD, the
system is fully diagonal in the phase space and thus linear
and nonlinear supermodes are degenerate. Note that for
the example presented above, the nonlinear supermodes
obtained via Autonne-Takagi (or Bloch-Messiah) diago2
nalization exhibit the same levels of squeezing KN
+m (z)
(not shown) as those shown in Figure 2a for linear supermodes, but a different spatial profile at each propagation
length z [45].
c. Individual mode basis. The solution in the individual mode basis is straightforwardly obtained from
PN
Equation (9) with the basis change Âj = k=1 Mk,j B̂k .
Note that this is analogous to input a set of N independently squeezed states in an N × N interferometer
given by the orthogonal matrix M ≡ M (f~). This configuration can thus produce entanglement in the individual
mode basis as we will show in the next section.
Figure 2b shows the evolution of maximum individual
mode Aj squeezing [V (yj (θj ), yj (θj )) < 1] over a generalized phase quadrature yj (θj ) [59] for the same configuration and coupling strengths than Figure 2a. In this
case we set independently the LO phase of each BHD
as θj (z) to maximize the squeezing of the jth individual
mode. Note that there are distances where the individual
mode squeezing for modes j = 2, 4 (orange) is over the
shot noise. In contrast to the linear supermode case, the

evolution of squeezing is complex in the individual mode
basis and it is difficult to obtain physical insight directly
from it. Moreover, this configuration presents quantum
correlations (not shown) that can lead to entanglement.
The possibilities of our concept go nonetheless considerably beyond the flat pump profile. The ANW presents
a large number of degrees of freedom that can be suitably tuned in order to yield a desired mode of operation.
We tackle this question in depth and exhibit the versatility of the ANW addressing a crucial and fundamental
issue in quantum information processing: the generation
of multipartite entanglement. We showcase two remarkable axes in the most appropriate encoding: i) in section
IV, partial numerical optimization on the pump phase
profile in the individual mode basis, and ii) in section V,
full numerical optimization on all available parameters to
demonstrate versatility in the individual mode basis and
in optimized nonlocal bases built from nonlinear supermodes.

D.

Encoding strategies summary

To end this section, we sketch an informal practical
landscape of the introduced bases in the ANW: i) the
elements of the individual mode basis A are modes associated with a single waveguide, they can be distributed
to spatially distant locations. All elements of this basis can be jointly measured and the detection basis is
fixed. Squeezing is not optimal in this basis. It is directly
connected to applications in quantum networks and can
be used in existing communication, sensing and computing protocols (see section VI and especially table II); ii)
the elements of the linear supermode basis B are collective modes. Only one mode can be measured at a time
and the detection basis is fixed (pump profile and device
length independent). Squeezing is in general not optimal.
B is useful to derive trends analytically [45] as in Figure
2a that can be applied to the other encodings (A, C) and
this basis is well suited to quantum simulation; iii) the elements of the nonlinear supermode basis C are collective
modes. Only one mode can be measured at a time and
the detection basis is variable (pump profile and device
length dependent). Squeezing is optimal in this basis.
Entanglement is engineered in the measurement stage.
It is close to a rich niche in the spectral domain [16–18]
and is well suited to engineer quantum states and study
their features.

of application through all-photonic quantum repeaters
[60, 61]. Measuring multipartite full inseparability in CV
systems requires the simultaneous fulfillment of a set of
conditions which leads to genuine multipartite entanglement when pure states are involved [62]. This criterion,
known as van Loock - Furusawa inequalities (VLF), can
be easily calculated from the elements of the covariance
matrix V in a given basis. Full N -partite inseparability
is guaranteed if the following N − 1 inequalities are simultaneously violated in a basis with modes labelled by

elements of the nonlinear supermode basis are not entangled – i.e. are independent–, but they can be used
as a starting point to engineer entangled states through
suitable transformations. More details are presented in
sections V and VI.
Firstly, as an example of a non-optimal procedure we
focus on the cases shown in Figure 3: N = 5 ANW with
a homogeneous coupling profile fj = 1 and a flat pump
power distribution (|ηj | = |η|, ∆φ = φj+1 − φj = 0).
We analyze the impact of the coupling strength C0 on
the multipartite entanglement as we noticed in Figures

coupling strength C0 : 0.08 mm−1 (dashed), 0.24 mm−1
(solid), and 0.72 mm−1 (dotted). The three cases present
regions where fully multipartite entanglement is achieved
(ρj < 4). The lower the value of C0 , the larger the violation of the inequalities as expected from Figure 2a.

power per waveguide |η|, among them |η| = 0.015 mm−1 ,
the case shown in Figure 3. Genuine multipartite entanglement is obtained for any value of |η| shown. Remarkably, the simultaneous violation of the four inequalities at
|η| = 0.015 mm−1 by only optimizing the pump phases
exhibits the versatility of our approach. Note that the
above optimization procedure represents a lower bound
on the violations based on the fitness function we have
chosen and our optimization algorithm. Hence, there can
be other sets of parameters which present larger violations of the VLF inequalities.
In the next section we broaden the spectrum of applications of the ANW to the optimized generation of
multipartite states with a specific geometry: the cluster
states. The interest in these states lies in that they are
the essential resource of MBQC and one of the main actors in the quest for a photonic quantum computer [65].
V.

OPTIMIZATION FOR CLUSTER STATES

MBQC relies on the availability of a large multimode
entangled state on which a specific sequence of measurements is performed. The choice of natural or exotic bases
widens the range of application in MBQC [66]. In our
case the cluster states can be encoded in the individual
mode basis or any other basis of the array.
An ideal CV cluster state is a simultaneous eigenstate
of specific quadrature combinations called nullifiers [5, 6].
Cluster states are associated with a graph or adjacency
matrix J reflecting those nullifiers. The nodes of the
graph represent the modes of the cluster state in a given
basis, and the edges the entanglement connections among
the modes. Moreover, the labelling of the nodes can be
suitably set to maximize the entanglement. The nullifiers
are given by
δ̂i ≡ x̂i (θi +π/2)−

N
X

Ji,i0 x̂i0 (θi0 ) ∀i = 1, . . . , N, (11)

i0 =1

where J is the adjacency matrix and x̂i (θi ) is the ith
generalized quadrature in a given basis [59]. We consider
unit-weight cluster states with Ji,i0 = 1 for modes i and
i0 being nearest neighbors in the graph and all the other
entries of J are zero. The variances of the nullifiers tend
to zero in the limit of infinite squeezing. Experimentally,
a cluster state can be certified if two conditions are satisfied: i) the noise of a set of normalized nullifiers lies
below shot noise
V (δ̄i ) < 1 ∀i = 1, . . . , N,
(12)
p
where δ̄i ≡ δi / 1 + n(i) is the normalized nullifier and
n(i) is the number of nearest neighbours to the ith node

9
of the cluster, and ii) the cluster state is fully inseparable,
i.e. it violates a set of VLF inequalities [11, 62].
As the encoding of quantum information is mode basisdependent, building on the formalism and measurement
possibilities of section III we demonstrate the versatility
of our platform by presenting two strategies for clusterstate generation: one where the individual modes are set
as the nodes of the cluster, and another based on nonlinear supermodes. We exhibit below how optimized configurations can produce different types of clusters shown
in Figure 5 focusing on the individual mode basis, and
discuss applications of both encoding schemes in section
VI.

A.

Individual modes as nodes of the cluster

In the individual mode basis, we set the simplest labelling: the ith node of the graph corresponds to the
jth mode. The large size of the parameter space corresponding to the ANW enables the optimized generation
of different classes of cluster states. WePuse the sum of
~ θ)
~ = 5 V (δ̄i ) with
the five nullifier variances FC (~η , φ,
i=1
15 free parameters as the fitness function to minimize.
For the sake of comparison, we use the same parameters
as in the previous section, i.e. a homogeneous coupling
profile fj = 1 with coupling strength C0 = 0.24 mm−1
and a fixed length z = 30 mm. Table I details the optimized nullifier variances obtained for the N = 5 nodes
cluster states shown in Figure 5. Remarkably, we have
~ θ}
~ to generate the
found realistic sets of parameters {~η , φ,
clusters in the five analyzed cases. In particular, the linear cluster is optimized with a pump profile very close to
the flat one that we introduced in section III. We have
used here the same set of pump parameters for optimizing star-shaped and GHZ clusters, since both are related
by only local oscillator phase shifts [67]. Full inseparability of the generated states is ensured using the variances
of the nullifiers exhibited in Table I in the expressions
shown in appendix A. We have checked this approach
on cluster state generation with up to N = 15 modes
obtaining similar values of nullifier variances for realistic
parameters (not shown). Note that the use of a different
fitness function or node labelling can lead to different
values of nullifier variances. Therefore, the generation
of cluster states in a fixed detection basis is possible in
ANWs. Enough degrees of freedom in the pump and the
detection are available to compensate for the monolithic
coupling structure of the array and yield significant entanglement.

B.

Cluster states based on nonlinear supermodes

Lower nullifier variances and hence closer-to-ideal cluster states can be obtained using a non-fixed custom detection basis. As introduced in section III, the covariance
matrix measured at the output of the ANW can indeed be

diagonalized by a Bloch-Messiah decomposition through
Equation (8) leading to nonlinear supermodes. Likewise,
the covariance matrix associated to a given N -mode cluster VC can be constructed from N phase squeezed inT
put states. We write VC = SC K̄ 2 (~r) SC
, where SC is
the symplectic and orthogonal transformation –a change
of mode basis– which produces the cluster associated
with J, and K̄ 2 (~r) is a symplectic diagonal matrix which
stands for phase-squeezed states. The elements of ~r are
the squeezing parameters corresponding to each mode of
encoding. Thus, setting the nonlinear supermodes as the
~ z) = K̄ 2 (~r),
basis the cluster is built from, i.e. K 2 (~η , φ,
the cluster and the ANW covariance matrices are related
by
T
~ ϕ
~ ϕ
VC = SLO (~η , φ,
~ , z)V (z)SLO
(~η , φ,
~ , z),

(13)

~ ϕ
~ z) is a symplecwhere SLO (~η , φ,
~ , z) = SC Ō(~
ϕ)R1T (~η , φ,
tic and orthogonal matrix, and Ō(~
ϕ) is an orthogonal
matrix related to the freedom of distributing the degree
of squeezing among the cluster nodes (see appendix B).
Then, the covariance matrix associated to the cluster
state can be retrieved from the one related to the ANW
via SLO . Below we show two different ways to access
cluster states with this encoding.
The first approach is to use a LO with a spatial profile given by the complex representation of SLO . As discussed at section III B, this can be carried out by means
of a single-mode free space BHD or via a multimode
fibered BHD analogously to what was done in the spectral domain [18]. In the present case any cluster is reachable through suitable shaping of a multimode LO with
common phase and amplitude references (see Figure 1).
Thus, what is to optimize is the distribution of squeezing among the different nonlinear supermodes, i.e. the
~ z) [44]. Once the squeezing is optielements of K 2 (~η , φ,
mized, the multimode LO is shaped using the profile of
~ ϕ
SLO (~η , φ,
~ , z) to measure each nullifier.
The second approach is based on the emulation of the
statistics of a given cluster state. This is carried out
with a multimode fibered BHD with independent singlemode LOs and postprocessing the photocurrents coming
from every detector [16, 66]. In this case the transforma~ LO (θ),
~
tion SLO can be decomposed as SLO = Ōpost (ϑ)D
~
~
where DLO (θ) and Ōpost (ϑ) are transformations associated to the LO phase profile and to the postprocessing
gains, respectively (see appendix B). Note that emulation
and LO shaping are not conceptually different, but related to the BHD detection scheme experimentally available. We show a detailed example of this approach with
the cluster states of Figure 5 in the appendix B.
Thus, the nullifiers associated to any N-dimensional
cluster state can be directly measured with a suitable
shaped LO via Equation (13), or approximately emulated
by postprocessing. Moreover, a large class of Gaussian
0
computations can be performed replacing SC by SC =
Ucomp SC , with Ucomp the orthogonal matrix associated
to the required computation [66, 68].

DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES

We finish first discussing on the encoding and processing of information in different mode bases. We then give
perspective on the range of application of ANW-based
quantum information processing, and we finally discuss
on the feasibility of our approach.
The individual mode basis is a natural basis to implement cluster states in the spatial domain due to a simple
detection scheme [11]. This basis is however harder to
implement in other domains, for instance in the spectral
domain [44]. As we have demonstrated above, the ANW
is a versatile source of cluster states with this straightforward encoding. The nonlinear supermode basis offers an
even higher flexibility through postprocessing or shaping
the basis of detection at the cost of an increased complexity in the detection setup.
Let us compare both the encoding schemes of quantum information we have introduced above, the individual mode basis and the nonlinear supermode basis, in
terms of their respective abilities in quantum information
processing and quantum networks –or quantum graphs
[69]–. In the individual mode basis the measurement basis is fixed. The quantum network is physically yielded
by the array with spatially distant nodes, which allows
simultaneous access to all the nodes of the network and
the detection is addressed by independent BHDs. See
Table II for a summary of possible applications of the
cluster states shown in Figure 5 or similar. In contrast,
any other basis based on nonlinear supermodes does not

have a fixed measurement basis as the supermodes change
at every propagation distance. The quantum graph is
produced by LO shaping or emulated by postprocessing.
Each node is encoded in the whole profile of the output SPDC light, allowing access only to one node of the
network at a time. The resource of both quantum networks and graphs is entanglement. However, multimode
entanglement relies on both the quantum state and measurement process [18]. Thus, even single-mode squeezed
states in the individual mode basis encoding can produce quantum graphs in the nonlinear supermode-based
encoding with a suitable detection. This basis has been
used to for instance simulate a quantum secret sharing
protocol [18].
We assess now the usefulness of both approaches in
terms of a specific quantum protocol like MBQC. The
individual mode basis enables sequential or one-shot
MBQC. Remarkably, universal single-mode Gaussian operations are possible using linear cluster states, homodyne detection and classical postprocessing [12, 70]. It is
particularly easy in this basis to couple the state to be
computed to the cluster by means of a 3 dB fibered beam
splitter. Thus the individual mode basis is a convenient
basis for traditional MBQC. Direct Gaussian MBQC is
possible in the nonlinear-supermode postprocessing approach, however it is not universal in general [68]. Twodimension cluster states are required for the most general universal MBQC [6]. Recently, the generation of
this class of states has been demonstrated by spatial and
time-domain multiplexing [7, 8]. The level of squeezing
necessary to implement fault-tolerant MBQC is neverthe-

less far from technologically available [73]. Fault-tolerant
MBQC is potentially realizable with lower squeezing
thresholds by using cluster states of higher dimension
[74]. It is then foreseeable that future MBQC will be
based on multiplexing the CV modes in space, time, frequency or angular momentum, and on integration on chip
[75]. The ANW represents a potential platform to implement that technology as the spatial encoding can be
multiplexed in frequency and time in the pulsed regime.
We would now like to disclose some possible research
directions which follow from this work. The first is emulation of quantum complex networks [14]. The dynamics
of an ensemble of quantum harmonic oscillators linked according to a specific topology can be mapped to our multimode platform through the symplectic propagator S(z)
of section III. The temporal evolution of a quantum network Snet (t) is directly mapped to our propagator S(z),
which can be experimentally realized by adequate pump
profile optimization and multimode BHD. The tunability our approach enables the study of different network
topologies with a single setup.
Another interesting feature of integrated ANW is the
possibility to include non-Gaussian operations on the
quantum state, cornerstone of quantum advantage in CVMBQC. Single-photon subtraction can be indeed implemented by means of introducing defects in the array, i.e.
a weakly coupled single waveguide in between two ANW
in such a way that the detection of a single photon deGaussifies and entangles the propagating quantum states
related to each array [76, 77].
Additionally, besides the practical applications in CV
previously discussed such as quantum secret sharing and
MBQC, an appealing exploitation of the ANW in DV is
Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) [78]. As every N -mode
Gaussian state generated in the array can be decomposed
by Autonne-Takagi (Bloch-Messiah) into N single-mode
squeezers in between two linear interferometers, the sampled photon pattern at the output of the ANW enables
the computation of the hafnian of the matrix which characterizes the quantum state. Moreover, the ANW operating in the SPDC or optical parametric amplification

regimes can be a suitable platform for the simulation of
molecular vibronic spectra through GBS [79–81].
Finally, we discuss the feasibility of our approach with
respect to the state of the art in integrated CV. The
pump coherence along its profile and with the local oscillator is crucial to the generation and appropriate detection of the generated states. Mechanical and thermal
stabilities similar to the ones currently achieved in single
PPLN waveguides are expected to be achieved in the experimental implementation of our multiport scheme [23].
Both pump and detection schemes are suitable to be integrated on chip limiting issues associated with pump
phase noise [82, 83]. Waveguides few microns wide and
waveguide spacing on the order of tens of microns are
within the scope of standard technology [30]. The required homogeneity in nonlinearity and coupling is well
within what is routinely achieved by current technology
and one of the strengths of our proposal is that many
external parameters (pump and LO profile, postprocessing) can compensate for imperfections. Current 127 µmspacing commercial V-groove arrays limit the maximum
number of waveguides of the ANW. The larger the number of waveguides the longer the chip in order to avoid
the losses related to the bends in the input-ouput waveguiding region. With proton-exchange technology we estimate N ≈ 8-16 waveguides as reasonable [30, 83]. The
limiting factor of integration density can be overcome
with nanophotonic nonlinear technologies [84, 85]. The
influence of losses on the CV entanglement can be included in our analysis by standard methods [37]. Propagation losses have a small impact on squeezing and entanglement assuming typical values in PPLN waveguides
(≈ 0.14 dB cm−1 ) and sample lengths (2-3 cm) [23, 83].
Nonlinearities as high as g = 24 × 10−4 mm−1 mW−1/2 ,
and coupled cw pump powers ranging from tens to few
hundreds milliwatts, have been recently shown in soft
proton exchange and ridge PPLN waveguides [83, 86].
A squeezing level as high as -6.3 dB in cw has been recently demonstrated int a PPLN chip [86]. Furthermore,
nanophotonic PPLN waveguides promise to increase the
nonlinear efficiency one order of magnitude [84, 85]. The
pump profile engineering can be realized by means of
telecom off-the-shelf elements such as fiber attenuators,
phase shifters and V-groove arrays, or by means of active
elements in electrooptics materials such as LN [23]. An
overall squeezing detection efficiency of 94% has been recently reported using anti-reflection coating on the chip
output facet and balanced-homodyne-detector photodiodes with 99 % quantum efficiency [86]. The use of Vgroove arrays to fiber the output light can also lead to
balanced-homodyne-detector spatial mode-matching visibilities of 99%.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the array
of nonlinear waveguides is a versatile synthesizer of spatial multimode squeezing and multipartite entanglement.
The tuning knobs available in the array of nonlinear
waveguides enable a formidable degree of reconfigurability in a compact device. We have in particular intro-

12
duced a general formalism to analyze the generation of
quantum states in nonlinear waveguide arrays. We have
shown versatile and significant multipartite entanglement
in the experimentally most convenient basis –the individual mode basis–. We have theoretically demonstrated
that various cluster states appropriate for quantum networks and measurement-based quantum computing can
be generated in arrays of nonlinear waveguides with the
same optical setup, using pump and measurement shaping. Features such as scalability, reconfigurability, subwavelength stability, reproducibility and low cost make
this platform an appealing quantum technology in the
spatial encoding domain with respect to previous bulkoptics-based multipartite-entanglement approaches. The
analysis carried out here demonstrates that the array
of nonlinear waveguides is a competitive contender for
quantum communication, quantum computing and quantum simulation.

VLF inequalities corresponding to the 5-nodes cluster
states exhibited in Figure 5. Table I encodes node i in
the individual mode j, (i = j = 1, . . . , 5). Table III of
appendix B encodes node i in the nonlinear supermode
m (i = m = 1, . . . , 5). The upper bounds for complete
inseparability are slightly different from the usual ones
because of the use of normalized nullifiers [7, 19].

We have used here the fact that linear combinations of
nullifiers are also nullifiers in order to define δ̄4,5 . Due to
the symmetry of the cluster, the four VLF inequalities
are degenerate two by two.
e) GHZ
The GHZ cluster state is equivalent to the star cluster
by means of a π/2 LO rotation for all modes i 6= 3 as

into N (N − 1)/2 rotation matrices parametrized for instance by generalized Euler angles [87]. In our simulations of 5-node cluster states we have used 10 generalized Euler angles to parametrize each matrix: ϕ

(ϕ1 , . . . , ϕ10 ), ϑ
into account all possible rotations in a 5-dimensional
space.

Thus, a GHZ cluster state is generated using the same
set of parameters as that obtained for the star cluster
with a π/2 LO rotation in all the modes except the mode
3.

Appendix B

In this appendix we derive Equation (13), introduce
some definitions used in section V and show an example
of emulation of the statistics associated to the 5-nodes
linear cluster state of Figure 5 using nonlinear supermodes.
SC is a symplectic and orthogonal transformation
which produces the cluster Equation (11) from N phase
(ŷ)-squeezed input states given by a diagonal matrix with
positive entries K̄ 2 (~r). The cluster has thus an associT
ated covariance matrix VC = SC K̄ 2 (~r) SC
. A symmetric
cluster transformation SC can be obtained from the adjacency matrix J as follows [66]
!
Xs −Ys
SC =
,
Ys Xs
with Xs = (J 2 +I)−1/2 , Ys = JXs and I the identity matrix. The transformation related to the cluster shape SC
is defined up to a transformation S̄C (~
ϕ) = SC Ō(~
ϕ), with
Ō(~
ϕ) = diag{O(~
ϕ), O(~
ϕ)} and O(~
ϕ) is an N-dimensional
orthogonal matrix. This degree of freedom is related to
the freedom of distributing the degree of squeezing among
the cluster modes K̃ 2 (~r, ϕ
~ ) = Ō(~
ϕ)K̄ 2 (~r)Ō(~
ϕ)T . Thus,
setting the nonlinear supermodes as the basis the cluster
~ z) = K̃ 2 (~r), the cluster
is built from, i.e. taking K 2 (~η , φ,
VC and the ANW V (z) covariance matrices are related
through Equation (8) by

VC = SLO (~η , φ,

ϕ)R1T (~η , φ,

~
we have used here K (z) ≡ K (~η , φ, z) and R1 (z) ≡
~ z) in order to emphasize the dependence of the
R1 (~η , φ,
Bloch-Messiah decomposition with the pump parameters.
The postprocessing matrix Ōpost (ϑ) is an orthogonal
matrix given by Ōpost (ϑ) = diag{Opost (ϑ), Opost (ϑ)}.
Both matrices O(ϕ) and Opost (ϑ) can be decomposed

and sin (θ) is defined equally. We have used 5 local oscillator phases θ~ = (θ1 , . . . , θ5 ) in our simulations.
We show an example of the method ii) introduced in
section V B with the cluster states of Figure 5. The
nodes of a given graph are obtained applying the corresponding transformations S̄C (~
ϕ) to the nonlinear supermodes. We choose to minimize the following fit~ ϕ

Frobenius norm kAk = i,j |Ai,j |2 . The optimization

the N = 5 nodes cluster states shown in Figure 5. We
use the same working point as for Table I above: homogeneous coupling profile fj = 1 with coupling strength

xi (θi ) = xi cos (θi ) + yi sin (θi ) and yi (θi ) = −xi sin (θi ) +
yi cos (θi ).
