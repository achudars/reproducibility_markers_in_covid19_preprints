Abstract.

In the same way ecosystems tend to increase maturity by decreasing the flow
of energy per unit biomass, we should move towards a more mature science by
publishing less but high-quality papers and getting away from joining large teams
in small roles. That is, we should decrease our scientific productivity for good.

The number of scientific journals listed in the Journal of Citation Reports has
increased during the last decade from 6, 443 to 8, 860 (Table 1), and hence, the
world’s scientific production (i.e., number of papers published by the scientific community per year) has grown from 905, 349 to 1, 398, 003 in that period (Fig. 1a).
Journals act like fertilizers for the soil, opening up new opportunities for scientists
to publish the results of their research. Consolidated scientists can increase their
scientific productivity (i.e., number of papers published per scientist and year).
On the other hand, novel scientists—who did not publish before because of the
fierce competition for space in journals—can enter into the scientific publication
system. Disentangling the detrimental consequences of the never-ending increase
of the number of journals (i.e., higher scientific productivity) from its advantageous
effects (i.e., recruiting novel scientists) is of paramount importance to support or
discourage the proliferation of new scientific journals.
Since the number of authors has increased (from 3, 052, 068 to 5, 318, 208) faster
than the number of papers published during the last decade (75% and 50%, respectively), adding more journals into the publication system seems to have reduced
scientific productivity. Note, however, that using the ratio

#papers
#authors

(i.e,. scientific

production over the number of authors) as a proxy of scientific productivity (Fig.
1b) assumes single-authored papers. This negative linear relationship still holds
for multiple-author papers if we assume that the average number of authors signing
a research paper has not changed over time. Yet, the only way to keep scientific
productivity constant over time when the number of authors increases faster than
the number of papers is by increasing the number of authors signing a paper. This
suggests that, even when the number of papers grows at a lower pace than the
number of authors, the higher the frequency of papers signed by many authors is,
2

the higher might be scientific productivity.
The relative frequency of papers signed by five or more authors has increased
during the last decade from 40% to 53% (Fig. 1c). Single-author papers, papers
signed by two, three and four authors—but not by five or more authors—have
decreased over time (shown by negative and statistically significant correlations;
see Table 2). This resulting increase in the average number of authors per paper
over time must be incorporated in any measure of scientific productivity.
One way to measure scientific productivity per year taking into account the
increase of the frequency of papers signed by many authors is the following:
20 
P

scientific productivity =


#papers(i) ∗ i

i=1

#authors

,

where #papers(i) is the number of papers signed by i authors and #authors is
the total number of authors of all the papers published that year. Note that we
did not consider papers signed by more than 20 authors because the percentage of
those papers was lower than 0.5%. This measure shows that scientific productivity
has increased over time (5% during the last decade; Fig. 1d) as a consequence of
the proliferation of new journals.
While it is true that having more journals has allowed novel scientists to enter
into the scientific publication system, most of them are just part of multi-authored
papers. In the same way ecosystems tend to increase maturity by decreasing the
flow of energy per unit biomass (Margalef, The American Naturalist, 97 (1963):
357-374), we need to move towards a more mature science where we should publish
less but high-quality papers (i.e., trend towards decreasing scientific productivity).
It’s time to face the conflict between the strategies of science and publishers.

Methods.
Data were obtained from inCites (https://incites.thomsonreuters.com/#/analytics;
“Journals” and “People”), an integrated web-based platform based on the data
from the Web of Science by Clarivate Analytics (provided by the University of
Zurich). We focused on the journals included in the Science Citation Index Expanded which covers 177 subject areas out of the 252 subject categories comprised
by the Web of Science schema (i.e., “Filters: Research Area”; we selected the areas
from http://mjl.clarivate.com/scope/scope_scie/). We count as papers only regular scientific articles that report original research, not books, reviews, editorials,
letters to the editor and the like (i.e., “Filters: Document type”; we selected “Article”). We restrict our search to the journals listed in the Journal Citation Reports
(i.e., “Thresholds: JIF Quatile”; we selected Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4). The number of papers published by i = 1, 2, ...n authors was obtained using an additional threshold
(i.e., “Thresholds: Authors per Document”; we selected Min=1 and Max=1 for
single-authored papers, ...).
