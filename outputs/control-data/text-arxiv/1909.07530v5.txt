Abstract Quantum Counterfactual Communication is the recently-proposed
idea of using quantum physics to send messages between two parties, without any matter/energy transfer associated with the bits sent. While this has
excited massive interest, both for potential ‘unhackable’ communication, and
insight into the foundations of quantum mechanics, it has been asked whether
this process is essentially quantum, or could be performed classically. We examine counterfactual communication, both classical and quantum, and show
that the protocols proposed so far for sending signals that don’t involve matter/energy transfer associated with the bits sent must be quantum, insofar as
they require wave-particle duality.

1 Introduction
Quantum Counterfactual Communication is the combination of counterfactual
circumstances (where “things... might have happened, although they did not
in fact happen” [1]) with quantum physics, to send information between two
parties without any matter/energy transfer associated with the bits sent (although in any practical implementation of it there is matter/energy transfer
in the protocol as a whole). Given its interesting foundational implications,
and potential for ‘unhackable’ communication, it has excited massive interest
in recent years [2–65].
What, if anything, makes these protocols essentially quantum [14]? To
answer this, we need to determine the underlying structure of classical counJonte R. Hance · John Rarity

terfactual communication for comparison (Section 2), and give a sufficient
condition for a protocol to be quantum (Section 3).
Section 4 then examines the quantum counterfactual communication protocols proposed so far, to assess their non-classicality. We show what separates
them from classical counterfactual communication protocols and how they
meet the condition for being quantum.
We identify two essential differences between classical and quantum counterfactual communication. The first is that only one bit-value (e.g. ‘0’) can be
sent in a classical protocol without matter or energy transfer associated with
the bit being sent. The second is that the two-value quantum protocols require
wave-particle duality to be able to send either bit value of each bit sent.

2 Classical Counterfactuality
Counterfactual communication long predates quantum mechanics. For instance,
in the Sherlock Holmes story, Silver Blaze, Holmes infers a racehorse was abducted by its own trainer, as the stable dog didn’t bark. As Holmes puts it,
“the curious incident of the dog in the night-time” was that the dog did nothing [66]. A more recent fictional example is the Bat-Signal. If there were a
major crime being committed the Bat-Signal would appear in the sky, and so
the Bat-Signal’s absence counterfactually communicates to Bruce Wayne that
all is well. Whenever we receive information from a sign’s absence we are being
signalled to counterfactually (e.g. the signal that an engine’s components are
functioning as they should is that the warning light is off).
Obviously in each of these cases a single bit is transmitted, and the bit
value is signalled without the transfer of matter or energy. However, only one
bit-value can be communicated by an absence in this way. Had a stranger
kidnapped the racehorse, the dog would have barked, and energy would have
have been transferred through the communication channel; correspondingly
of course the Bat-Signal and other warning lights involve the transmission of
energy when they are on. A sign’s absence can transmit one value of a bit,
only if the sign always occurs for the other bit value [67]. This is counterfactual
communication based on counterfactual inference.1 Counterfactual inference
is not rare but ubiquitous in everyday life and in science. For example, if there
was an ether then the Michelson-Morley experiment would not have a null
result.
The structure of classical counterfactual communication as above is as
follows. Were A to happen, B would happen. B did not happen. Therefore
A did not happen. B not happening is a signal that A did not happen, only
because B happening signals that A happened.
Formally,
1 It is not required that the signalled event’s non-occurrence directly causes the the sign’s
absence, as there could be other common causal factors. Also a channel may be more reliable
for signalling one bit value than for another.

Any instance of this structure in which B doesn’t happen can be thought
of as counterfactual communication of A’s not happening. However, typically,
we want a one-to-one correspondence between the signalling event A and the
inferred event B, so we always recognise the inferred event’s absence. For this,
we need the further condition that, were A not to happen, B would not happen
(¬A ⊃ ¬B).

3 Quantum as Non-Classical
Next, to evaluate the proposed protocols we need a sufficient condition for
something being quantum. There are many differences between classical and
quantum physics. For optics (which all protocols so far have used), classical
physics is everything up to and including Maxwell’s equations. These formulate
light as the evolution of waves whose intensity can be split continuously [68].
In contrast to this, in the quantum optics needed for many situations, we must
consider light as photons [69], which are quanta of the electromagnetic field
that are detected as discrete packets of absorbed energy. Despite this discrete
particle-like behaviour, in propagation photons retain wave-like properties such
as interference. Therefore, in the context of optics it is appropriate to take a
protocol to be quantum if it requires using both wave- and particle-like features
by combining interference with single photon detection. The latter nullifies the
splitting of light intensity across different detectors, and forces it to end in a
single location.

4 Protocol Evaluation
4.1 Salih et al’s Protocol
Of the protocols proposed so far, only one has been shown counterfactual by
both Weak Trace and Consistent Histories - Salih et al’s [34][41]. We show
this protocol in Fig.1 and give a detailed description in the associated caption.
Above we argued that a sufficient condition for a protocol to be quantum is
that it requires both discreteness and path-interference - which, for light, only
single photons can do. We now consider whether this protocol has to meet this
condition in order to be counterfactual.
While the limit of many single photons may generate the same results as
coherent states, the way in which they produce them differs. This is due to
the discreteness discussed, which is not considered when using coherent states,
but is when using Fock states (i.e. single photons).

Fig. 1 A schematic diagram of Salih et al’s protocol for counterfactual communication,
where, for every bit communicated, provably no photons have been to Bob. This version
shows for one outer interferometer cycle (M = 1), and multiple (N ) inner interferometer
cycles. The region of Alice is shown in pink, and the region of Bob in blue. Each Polarising Beamsplitter (PBS) reflects any vertically-polarised (V ) light, and transmits any
horizontally-polarised (H) light. The Half-Wave Plates (HWPs) rotate polarisation between
horizontal and vertical polarisation unitarily, by an angle of either π/2M (the HWPs before each outer interferometer) or π/2N (the HWPs before each inner interferometer). This
means, when Alice injects a horizontally-polarised photon from the source into her apparatus, the outer (left) path contains only horizontally-polarised light (labelled H), while a
small amount of V -polarised light is created by the first HWP, and injected into the inner interferometer chain. In each inner interferometer, the left (Alice) path contains only
V -polarised light, and the right (at Bob) only H-polarised light. If Bob does not block his
paths, the chain of N ‘π/N ’ rotations turn the V -polarised component in the inner interferometer chain to H, and so anything in the inner chain is sent to a loss channel D3 . This
means Alice can only receive the photon if it went via her outer path, and so arrived at
her D0 . If Bob blocks his paths, he absorbs this inner-chain H-polarised light, so the light
is continually reset to V -polarised at the end of each inner interferometer, which stays on
Alice’s side, and reaches her D1 as a V -polarised photon, having never travelled to Bob. A
small number of photons are absorbed at Bob, reducing the efficiency. The probability of
this happening decreases as M and N increase. Here, M is 1, but in general M ≥ 2, N ≥ 2.
The only way Alice’s D1 can click is if Bob blocks; and in the infinite limit of chained outer
cycles, the only way her D0 can click is if he doesn’t. Unlike the classical case, both the ‘0’
and ‘1’ bit-values are received without energy transfer across the channel, and so both are
sent counterfactually [34, 41].

In the quantum case, beamsplitters split a photon’s probability amplitude
between the two eigenstates that correspond to the photon going in each direction; in the classical case, they split the beam intensity (and field). As
interference still occurs, when Bob does not block, waves on both sides still
destructively interfere, so the light never returns to Alice. However, Bob’s D3
and Alice’s D0 both detect light simultaneously. Similarly, when he blocks,
light goes to his blockers and Alice’s D1 simultaneously. Therefore, in both
cases, as light goes between Alice and Bob, it is not counterfactual. While
the amount of light going to Bob’s D3 may be infinitesimal for an infinite
number of outer cycles, and that going to his blockers infinitesimal for infinite
inner cycles, this is not the same as no light going there in either case - so,
regardless the number of cycles, with classical light, the protocol isn’t counterfactual. This may seem obvious, but many have not realised this and claimed
this protocol could be performed classically (e.g. [14]).
The only way to avoid this is to force the light to end at only one point
- to postselect, with information only travelling when nothing goes between
Alice and Bob. Only single photons can do this. Therefore, the only way to
make the protocol counterfactual is to use these, and so make the protocol
quantum.
4.2 Vaidman’s Protocol
Alongside the proven protocol of Salih et al, Vaidman recently proposed one
[54] which, while not yet proven valid by Consistent Histories, has been shown
to be valid by the Weak Trace criterion. We show this protocol in Fig.1 and
give a detailed description in the associated caption. Similarly to Salih et
al’s, it relies on both interference and single-photon detection - without the
use of single photons, when Bob blocks the paths on his side of the inner
interferometers, light could reach both Bob’s blocker and Alice’s detector D1 .
Further, when Bob doesn’t block, light could reach both the loss channels
(marked ‘DL ’ in Fig. 2) and Alice’s D0 - in both these cases, the protocol
would definitely not be counterfactual.
Extrapolating from these protocols, any counterfactual protocol (valid or
not) whereby the interference from Bob blocking or not blocking his side
of an interferometer affects the destination of light on Alice’s side, without them both simultaneously detecting that light, relies on both wave-like
and particle-like properties. This means, all these protocols, from the ElitzurVaidman Bomb Detector, to Noh’s counterfactual cryptography scheme, to
even Arvidsson-Shukur et al’s proposal (despite only sending one bit-value
counterfactually), are essentially quantum by our definition above.
5 Conclusion
We have shown Quantum Counterfactual Communication is essentially quantum. This confirms that both particle-like behaviour and path interference

[54]. The region of Alice is shown in pink, and the region of Bob in blue. Unlike Salih et al’s,
it doesn’t use polarised light, instead making use of ordinary (non-polarising) beamsplitters.
By their design, when Bob doesn’t block his side of the channel, each inner interferometer
outputs into loss channels (here, the DL s). This means (unless the photon is lost) the interferometer on the outer arm (starting with the red beamsplitter) always outputs at D0 .
However, when Bob blocks, waves coming out of the inner interferometer chain negatively
interfere at the final beamsplitter, causing the photon (if it stays at Alice) to go to D1 . The
beam-splitting values given in this example make the losses equal, for two inner interferometers, regardless of whether or not Bob blocks his path (sends 1 or 0). We discuss this
further in Appendix B.4.2.

are necessary for schemes where both bit-values are sent counterfactually. In
all schemes demonstrated so far, this is the only way it is quantum (though
protocols which send quantum information have been proposed theoretically
[37, 38, 40, 70, 71]). Quantum Counterfactual Communication allows us to
look at principles at the heart of the foundations of quantum physics - selfinterference and counterfactual non-definiteness [72] - in a new and exciting

A Path of a Quantum Particle
To investigate Quantum Counterfactual Communication we need a criterion for a quantum
particle being/not being somewhere. This will allow us to establish if a protocol is actually
counterfactual.

A.1 Classical Approach
When considering where a quantum particle has been, our first instinct is to treat it as
spatially local. However, as quantum phenomena are not solely particle-like, but as also
have wave-like properties (as the Two-Slit Experiment shows [73]), this is not necessarily
the case. Therefore, we need a criterion for counterfactuality that takes into account quantum
phenomena.

A.2 No-Signal Approach
Based on this need for a stronger criterion, a common view posed (typically on initially
hearing of quantum counterfactual communication), is denying counterfactual communication is possible, by saying something can only be counterfactual if no information can pass
between A and B. However, as we showed above, there are many classical protocols which
are considered counterfactual communication, despite not fulfilling this criterion. Based on
counterfactuality referring to something which “might have happened, although they did not
in fact happen”, there is no reason to only call something counterfactual if no information
can be transferred. Counterfactual communication is demonstrably possible - we just look
at an extension of it.

A.3 Density Matrix Approach
Our first non-classical approach to a particle’s location is using the entire quantum mechanical description of the system. We can do this by looking at the density matrix, which shows
the whole of a state - it provides all the information that exists about a particle at a given
moment. By associating them with physical positions, we can see the spread of the particle’s
possible locations.
However, some parts of the density matrix correspond to paths lost when the wavefunction is collapsed at the protocol’s end, and so information not being sent. We need some
way to sort these possible paths into those where information is sent (that the particle could
have been on when counterfactual communication occurred) and those where it is not. This
requires post-selection (selection based on the final state they lead to), rather than just
pre-selection from an initial state.

A.4 Consistent Histories
To resolve this, we could use the Consistent Histories approach [74]. This involves creating
histories (tensored chains of projectors, each a way the system could evolve). A family is
a set of these histories, that form a projective decomposition of the identity operator over
the whole evolution time. By refining certain projectors (replacing them with projectors
summing to them), we can model a situation. These histories are consistent if they all
mutually commute - if they do not, it is meaningless to ask which history was the ‘correct’
model for the system’s evolution, as we cannot assign positive relative probabilities [75].
Therefore, we can say a particle has not gone between Alice and Bob when all histories
where it travels between the two (where information is sent), have probability zero. This

Fig. 3 The Two-State Vector Formalism applied to a nested interferometer. Forwardstravelling paths are marked by thin black lines, and backwards-travelling paths by thick
orange lines. Though no forward or backwards travelling path goes from the source, to Bob
(along path C) and into D2, they do overlap over C, meaning there is a weak trace at Bob.
This illustrates the peculiar property of the TSVF where particles can jump between regions
(e.g. between the inner interferometer and the outer arm) [51].

requires us to analyse all histories in this family, as Griffiths does for several protocols [15].
In essence, if a particle can go between Alice and Bob when information is transmitted,
by Consistent Histories it is not counterfactual; if not all the histories in the family are
consistent with one another, it is meaningless to talk about the counterfactuality of the
situation.

A.5 Weak Trace
Next, we consider weak measurement [76], which examines the state between measurements,
without collapsing it. Weak measurement involves lightly coupling a system to a measuring
device, so while little information is gathered over one run of the system, over many runs a
probability distribution is obtained. This contrasts with Von Neumann measurements, which
cause a system to collapse into an eigenstate of the measured operator. Weak measurement
allows us to collect information that would be lost were the system strongly measured [77].
To do this we apply the expectation value of the evolution operator to the initial state,
which we can interpret as evaluating all forward-evolving paths from that state.
However, rather than working forwards, can also work back from a given result (postselect), to investigate the paths the system may have evolved through. If we pre- and postselect like this, we say a particle leaves a weak trace (indicating possible presence) wherever
this weak measurement value is non-zero. To approximate this trace, we can trace the initial
vector forward, and the final vector backward, in time, and see where they overlap. If we
represent the evolution of the state by operator Ô, we get this approximate value as

14

Jonte R. Hance et al.

Ow =

ψf Ô |ψi i
hψf |ψi i

(2)

where |ψi i is the initial state of the particle, and ψf the final. This approximation of
the weak value (to the first order in trace size, O()) is the Two-State Vector Formalism
(TSVF), as it goes from/to two states - that at the beginning of the protocol, and that at
the end. This gives both pre- and post-selection needed.
If an operator returns a non-zero TSVF value, there is to O() a weak trace along the
path it describes. If we trace the paths a quantum particle could evolve along from its initial,
and those it could have come from to get to its final, state, there is a weak trace where they
overlap - so we cannot say the particle was not there [51].
However, this has unintuitive results. While, with Consistent Histories, a path needs
to link the initial and final states, here, it only requires paths from the initial and final
states overlap at some point. This means Bob can have a weak trace on his side of the
transmission channel, without any in the channel itself. This was demonstrated using weak
measurements in nested Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) by Danan et al [78]. If one
accepts the weak trace as a valid indicator of a particle’s path, this leads to peculiarities such as particles jumping discontinuously between locations [79]. This caused Sokolovski to
doubt the formalism, in favour of continuous paths. [80–82]. However, these peculiar results
don’t contradict standard quantum theory [83].
A more compelling counterargument is that the TSVF ignores the non-O() weak trace,
and so does not give the particle’s entire path. Vaidman admits this, saying the TSVF only
gives the weak trace to O(). Further, analysis of Danan et al’s data shows smaller, O(2 )
peaks not visible in their original presentation [84]. Vaidman explains this by saying the
non-local trace on any particle is also of O(2 ), and so this applies in any set-up, even if
objects are physically separated. Further, as there are no non-local interactions in nature,
this non-local weak trace cannot be strong enough to mediate any effects, so neither can a
local second-order weak trace [51]. Despite this, Vaidman still claims this constitutes a weak
trace for Salih et al’s one-outer-cycle protocol [54].

B Quantum Counterfactual Communication Protocols
In this Appendix, we look at Quantum Counterfactual Communication protocols proposed so
far. Since Elitzur and Vaidman first discovered quantum counterfactuality [85], and Kwiat
et al allowed loss to be made effectively nil [86], researchers have tried to exploit it for
communication. Despite this, all protocols until recently fell into three broad categories:
where communication is counterfactual only for one bit-value; where photons travel between
Alice and Bob, but in the opposite direction to the information passed between them; and
where no photons pass between Alice and Bob when information flows, but the error/loss
rates vary with the bit-value Bob sends.

B.1 Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester
All quantum counterfactual communication protocols stem from the Elitzur-Vaidman BombDetector [85]. Here (Fig.4), an MZI has a potentially faulty bomb along one of its paths,
which can only be detonated by a non-demolition single-photon detection.
If the photon goes along the bomb’s side of the MZI (and the bomb works), it detonates,
and the photon (and everything else) is destroyed; if the bomb is faulty, the photon travels to
the merging beamsplitter normally. However, if the photon traverses the other side, the bomb
working changes the interference pattern, making it able to go to a detector it previously
couldn’t access. This allows us to test if the bomb would have worked, without detonating
it, by putting it on the path the photon could have, but did not, travel down. Unlike
classical counterfactual communication, both options are transmitted counterfactually - the
photon’s path is from the source to the detectors without going via the object (bomb) under

Fig. 4 The Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester. A photon is emitted from the source (top-left),
enters the balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and is spread across both paths equally.
If the bomb is faulty, the photon recombines at the second beam-splitter, and always enters
D1 . If the bomb works, and is activated, it destroys the set-up. If the bomb would work,
but the photon went down the bomb-free path, the photon has a 50:50 chance of going to
either detector.

evaluation. However, it is not necessarily always counterfactual. This is as, while the photon
can carry the information without going via the bomb, it does not necessarily have to. This
means the Bomb-Tester is not fully counterfactual.

B.2 Counterfactual only for One Bit
Here, the protocol is counterfactual for one bit-value, but the photon goes between Alice
and Bob for the other.
The first of this type of protocol, and indeed the first Quantum Counterfactual Communication protocol proposed was Noh’s (Fig.5) [31], (barring Guo’s E-V Bomb Detector
adaption, where photons travel between Alice and Bob for both bit-values [18]). For matched
polarisations, if Alice gets a click, the photon has remained on her side. However, for orthogonal polarisations, it has both been to, and returned from, Bob - so is not counterfactual.
Despite this, the work generated a lot of interest [50, 57, 25, 32, 7, 28, 58, 60, 61, 44, 45, 26,
62, 27, 29, 46, 47, 55, 56, 49, 43]. While plenty of these focus on reducing loss by reducing
the proportion of the photon sent to Bob [50], this must be non-zero for the protocol to
function. Therefore, the system will never be fully counterfactual.

16

Jonte R. Hance et al.

Fig. 5 Noh’s counterfactual cryptography protocol - Alice randomly polarises a photon,
which passes through a beam-splitter, with one of the outputs going to Bob. Bob uses a
PBS and delay to time-separate possible polarisations arriving it him, and picks one to
reflect and one to absorb. If the photon is Bob’s reflect-polarisation, it reflects back, and
interferes into Alice’s D2 . However, if the photon is his absorb-polarisation, it is sent into
his detector. If this clicks, the protocol is aborted; if not, the photon goes into D1 [31].

B.3 Information and Photon Travel in Opposite Directions
In the next category, the photon can cross the channel, but in the opposite direction to the
information being sent. Here, for one bit-position the photon destructively interferes across
the quantum channel, keeping it at Alice, and for the other, it constructively interferes,
allowing it through to Bob. Based on if she detects a photon, Alice can determine which bit
Bob sent.
The only protocol of this sort is Arvidsson-Shukur et al’s. They propose a device formed
of chained MZIs, which use the Quantum Zeno effect to (for many MZIs) keep the photon
at Alice if Bob blocks, and force it to go to Bob if he does not [4] - identically to Kwiat et
al’s Interaction Free Measurement protocol [86]. Ignoring the high chance of Alice wrongly
believing Bob did not block (due to the necessarily finite number of MZIs causing some
chance of Bob’s blocker absorbing the photon), the photon still travels at the same time as
the information. Waves carrying information in the opposite direction to travel is a wellknown classical phenomenon [54]. Therefore, this protocol only seems quantum when you
consider light as local - where, for one possibility, the photon travels from Alice to Bob. This
obviously creates a weak trace at Bob, and so is not counterfactual. Arvidsson-Shukur et al
attempt to advocate their protocol by saying it tolerates error better than others [6], and
by calling other protocols classical using a classical model with Alice and Bob having extra,
non-trivial resources (e.g. a shared clock) [5]. However, they give no reason to view their
protocol as true Quantum Counterfactual Communication, and so their work with Calafell
et al [8] just demonstrates classical counterfactuality.

B.4 Photon only Travels Erroneously
The next set of protocols have Alice receiving a photon for both bit values, which has never
been to Bob. This means the photon cannot go to Bob when Alice gains information, as
then Alice would be unable to see what was sent. Therefore, when photons go to Bob, the
protocol is aborted and retried, creating a source of loss.

B.4.1 Unequal Losses
For these protocols, this loss varies with the bit-value sent. This leads us to ask if Alice can,
by knowing loss probabilities, guess the bit Bob sends solely based on if any of her detectors
light up. This would make the same as the last category. We can also ask if this post-selection
is to blame for any peculiar effects observed, even with this loss enforced according to the
protocol.
Salih et al’s 2013 protocol was the first claiming to be fully counterfactual for both bit
values [33, 34]. It is formed of a chain of outer interferometers, each containing a chain of
inner interferometers (see Fig.1). However, Vaidman claimed this was not counterfactual,
when assessed by the Weak Trace criterion (see Fig.3) [51]. The TSVF gives a weak trace
on Bob’s side of the channel when Bob does not block this, meaning we cannot say the
photon was not there [52, 53]. However, this is only for the simplest (polarisation-free) form
of the protocol. Using polarisation (as shown in Fig.1 and [41]) avoids a weak trace on Bob’s
side by ensuring the only waves that go to Bob are H-polarised, which are lost via D3 on
Bob’s side, restarting the protocol [36]. Then, when Bob does not block, the differences
in polarisation between the forward- and backward-travelling states keep them separate
on Bob’s side - giving no Weak Trace there. This was tested practically through weak
measurement, using Danan et al’s method [78] and shown to have no weak trace from Bob’s
side visible at Alice’s detectors. Griffiths also claimed it is not counterfactual by Consistent
Histories, as a history with a non-zero probability could be traced to Bob’s side and back
when Bob does not block [15, 74, 16]. However, again, Griffiths only considered physical
paths, rather than polarisations, which provide an extra degree of freedom [39]. Griffith
later showed, when using more than one outer cycle, the family became inconsistent, and so
calling the protocol counterfactual was meaningless [17]. However, Salih notes the final outer
cycle is counterfactual, while identical earlier ones are meaningless, which seems paradoxical
[40]. Once Salih et al published their protocol, various implementations began to appear
[9, 20, 19, 35, 63, 48, 65, 11, 12, 21, 47, 3, 13, 37, 38, 10, 22, 23, 42, 30, 59, 40, 24, 87, 70, 71].
While many of these don’t make use of polarisation, some do.
Zhang et al proposed a protocol, based on Salih et al’s, for probabilistic counterfactual
communication. Their protocol isn’t always counterfactual, but they claim the chance of the
photon being at Bob can be reduced to nil, and losses (from noise/blocking) are lower [64].
However, they assume photons only trace one path, which isn’t always true - so it is not
counterfactual.
Despite originally claiming counterfactual communication of both bit-values was impossible, at roughly the same time as Salih et al defended their protocol using polarisation,
Vaidman, alongside Aharonov, released a protocol allowing just this [2]. This method is effectively the same as in Salih et al’s original protocol - however, to avoid a weak trace in this
set-up, where there is no polarisation degree of separation, at least two inner interferometers
are needed. Alongside this, Aharonov and Vaidman make repeated reference to a doublesided mirror in the protocol; but all this does is connect the two inner interferometers, and
fold the outer path to reduce physical space used, and so it is irrelevant to the protocol’s
counterfactuality. Also, unlike Salih et al’s, this protocol is not counterfactual by Consistent
Histories [40].

B.4.2 Equal Losses
Shortly after publishing with Aharonov, Vaidman created another weak trace-free counterfactual communication protocol. For one outer cycle, this protocol avoids the risk of an

18

Jonte R. Hance et al.

erroneous reading that Salih et al’s, and their earlier, protocol has [54]. It is again based
on a chained MZI set-up, but uses interference from light passing through the inner interferometer chain to alter which detector the photon ends up at when Bob blocks (see
Section 4.2). This allows Alice, when she receives a bit, to be certain it is the same value
Bob sent. Another benefit of the protocol is that, for certain beam-splitter values, losses
were the same whether or not Bob blocked. This means Alice cannot infer if Bob blocked,
just based on if she receives a photon. Therefore, the protocol cannot be reduced to the
information and photon travelling simultaneously, in opposite directions, and so it seems
counterfactual. However, it remains to be seen if it is fully counterfactual by the Consistent
Histories criterion.
