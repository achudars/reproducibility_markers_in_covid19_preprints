Abstract. CYGNO is a project realising a cubic meter demonstrator to study the scalability
of the performance of the optical approach for the readout of large-volume, GEM-equipped
TPC. This is part of the CYGNUS proto-collaboration which aims at constructing a network
of underground observatories for directional Dark Matter search. The combined use of highgranularity sCMOS and fast sensors for reading out the light produced in GEM channels during
the multiplication processes was shown to allow on one hand to reconstruct 3D direction of
the tracks, offering accurate energy measurements and sensitivity to the source directionality
and, on the other hand, a high particle identification capability very useful to distinguish nuclear
recoils. Results of the performed R&D and future steps toward a 30-100 cubic meter experiment
will be presented.

1. Introduction
This paper summarises the work performed by the CYGNO collaboration in developing a Time
Projection Chamber with an electron multiplication stage based on triple-GEM with an optical
readout.
This activity is carried out in the framework of the CYGNUS-TPC project [12] that aims
at building a multi-ton gas target distributed in underground labs using TPC techniques or
Directional Dark Matter search.
Time projection chambers provide very useful information:
‚Ä¢ it is possible to make a 3D reconstruction of the tracks in sensitive volume;

‚Ä¢ it can evaluate not only the total amount of released energy, but also its profile along the
particle trajectory allowing to reconstruct the dE/dx, very helpful for particle identification
and track head-tail discrimination;
‚Ä¢ large volumes can be acquired with small amount of readout channels.
For equipping large surfaces, the use of Micro Pattern Gas Detectors is a very simple solution
ensuring high space and time resolution. In particular Gas Electron Multipliers are able to
suppress the Ion Back Flow inside the sensitive volume.
During the multiplication processes, photons are produced along with electrons by the gas
through atomic and molecular de-excitation.
Optical readout of the light produced by GEM was already studied in the past [1‚Äì4, 11] and
showed several advantages:
‚Ä¢ optical sensors offer higher granularities with respect to electron sensitive devices;
‚Ä¢ optical coupling allows to keep sensor out of the sensitive volume reducing the interference
with high voltage operation and lowering the gas contamination;
‚Ä¢ the use of suitable lens allows to acquire large surfaces with small sensors;
A gas represents an interesting target: nuclei free paths can be long enough to be
reconstructed. In particular,  the maximum fraction of the energy that can be transferred
to the nucleus of mass mN by a Dark Matter particle of mass mœá is given by:

1.1. LEMON detector
In order to test the performance of the optical approach, several prototypes were tested, and,
in particular, all measurements described in this work were carried out on the Large Elliptical
MOdule (LEMON, Fig. 1) which is described in details in refs. [13‚Äì15].

Figure 1. Drawing of the experimental setup. In particular, the elliptical field cage close on
one side by the triple-GEM structure and on the other side by the semitransparent cathode (A),
the PMT (B), the adaptable bellow (C) and the CMOS camera with its lens (D) are visible.
The baseline gas mixture is an He/CF4 60/40 that showed to provide very clear optical
signals [?, 5, 6]. According to eq. 1, the use of He allows an efficient momentum transfer from
Dark Matter (DM) particles of 1 GeV mass (He ' 60%, Ar ' 10% and Xe ' 3%).

2. Operative threshold evaluation
To get an indication of the reliable detection threshold, the sensor noise level was studied and
compared to the detector response to 5.9 keV photons provided by a 55 Fe source.
2.1. Measurements with a 55 Fe source
Figure 2 shows an example of an image of two light spots due the interaction of the 55 Fe photons
in the gas.

Figure 2. Example of two clusters due to X-ray interaction in gas.
The spectrum of the total light in clusters reconstructed within the sensitive area and the
distribution of their size (i.e. the number of over-threshold pixels) are studied. Figure 3 shows
an example of these distributions for a run taken with VGEM = 450 V, Ed = 600 V/cm and Et
= 2 kV/cm.

Figure 3. Distribution of total light (left) and number of illuminated pixels (right) for a run
taken with VGEM = 450 V, Ed = 600 V/cm and Et = 2 kV/cm.
In order not to slow down the analysis procedure, only clusters with at least 30 pixels overthreshold were considered. The distribution is fitted with the sum of an exponential function to
model the background due to natural radioactivity , and a Polya function, expressed by Eq. 2,
often used to describe the response spectrum of MPGD [18]:
P (n) =

1 1
bn k!



n

¬∑ e‚àín/bn

(2)

where b is a free parameter and k = 1/b ‚àí 1. The distribution has n as expected value, while
the variance is governed by its mean and the parameter b: œÉ 2 = n(1 + bn). From the result of
the fits it is possible to evaluate:
‚Ä¢ the expected value of the distribution n and its variance œÉ 2 . These parameters, when
fitted on the light distributions, give the detector response in terms of number of photons
and the energy resolution. When fitting the number of illuminated pixels distribution, the
average size of the clusters can be evaluated by taking into account the effective area of
130 √ó 130 ¬µm2 seen by each single pixel.
‚Ä¢ the integral of the Polya component, that is proportional to the total number of
reconstructed clusters and that can be used to evaluate the detection efficiency;
Since, as it is shown on the left of Fig. 3, in this configuration 1169 ¬± 223 photons are collected
per cluster (i.e. each 5.9 keV released), a threshold of 400 photons corresponds to about 2 keV
released in the sensitive volume. The average cluster size was found to be 149 pixels (Fig. 3,
right).
2.2. Sensor electronic noise
The CMOS sensor used for the measurements has two main sources of noise:
‚Ä¢ a dark current of about 0.06 electrons per second per pixel;
‚Ä¢ a readout noise of about 1.4 electrons rms (in our set-up it was found to be slightly larger
probably due to an effect of ageing of the sensor built more than 5 years ago);
The sensor electronic noise represents a possible unavoidable instrumental background and
it can generate ghost-clusters. The distribution of the light in each ghost-cluster found in the
blind run is shown in Fig. 4. It shows a baseline component due to positively-definite counts of

photons and to the minimal number of two macro-pixels requested to form a cluster. In order
to define an operative threshold that allows to suppress fake signals due to sensor noise, the tail
of this distribution is studied. In particular, it is fitted with an exponential function:

p(L) = A0 e‚àí Œõ

where L is the number of photons collected in the cluster.

From the fitted parameters, A0 = (5.5 ¬± 0.1) √ó 104 and Œõ = 15.7 ¬± 0.4 photons, and by
taking into account that a run lasts 10 s, it is possible to extrapolate the probability of having a
ghost-clusters with an amount of light larger than a given threshold. Results for three threshold
values are shown in Table 1.

More detailed analysis (e.g. topological light distribution) can be further exploited to
discriminate clusters induced by signals from ghost-clusters. This information has not been used
in the data analysis presented in this paper, but it will provide additional handle to suppress
the backgrounds in the future.
3. Combined Optical Read-out
To overcome the poor timing information provided by the CMOS, a combined light readout with
a fast PMT was tested.
In Fig. 5, the PMT signal is shown for an inclined electron crossing the 1 cm drift gap at an
angle of 0.1 rad (almost 6‚ó¶ ) with respect to the GEM foils.
The arrival time of the main clusters is clearly visible, allowing an independent reconstruction
of their absolute position in z. Taking into account the gap width (1 cm) and the width of the
signal (about 135 ns), an electron drift velocity of 72 ¬µm/ns is found in agreement with the
value evaluated with Garfield.
Figure 6 shows an example of the lateral profile of the detected light as seen by the CMOS
camera for a track together with the corresponding PMT waveform.
In both cases, with a simple peak finding algorithm, the position of the main peaks was
evaluated. The tracks in the ten analysed events have an average length of almost 60 mm and

clusters found in a single track. Right: Distribution of the residuals of the reconstructed to the
linear fit z for ten tracks with a superimposed gaussian fit.
54 peaks were found in total. Therefore, the algorithm is able to identify one peak per track
centimetre on average.
By assuming these peaks as due to ionization clusters along the tracks, their x and z
coordinates can be evaluated. Their correlation is shown on the left of Fig. 7 while the
distribution of the reconstructed z residuals to a linear fit for a set of ten tracks (used as
an example) is shown on the right.
From the superimposed fit, it is possible to evaluate a resolution on the reconstructed z
coordinate of about 100 ¬µm.
4. Operation Stability
The stability of the operation of the prototype was tested in laboratory. High voltage values in
the detector were set to working conditions. For 13 days the detector was kept operative while the

currents and environmental parameters were continuously monitored by an automated system
and images due to natural radioactivity were recorded. From time to time, some hot-spots,
due to micro-discharges in imperfect channel, appear on the GEM surface. Usually they do not
involve large currents, but they can grow up making the detector drawing a sizable current. An
automatic recovery procedure was implemented able to turn OFF these hot-spots by lowering
and gradually restoring the HV conditions in few minutes. Together with these slow phenomena,
the detector had some sudden jump in current rapidly reset due to discharge.
Figure 8 shows an example of the behavior of the detector current.

Figure 8. Plot of the currents drawn by the third GEM (see text for details).
In total 28 discharges (3/day) and 72 hot spots (8/day) are visible during the acquisition
period. Apart from these events, the current does not show any instabilities and detector
operation was rather stable. The recovery procedure lasted for a total of 15 hours making the
detector live-time 94%.
5. The CYGNO project
This technology showed to be really promising to develop a detector for Directional Light Dark
Matter search. The drafting of a Technical Design Report was funded to describe a 3/4 year
project leading to construction of CYGNO, a 1 m3 TPC based on optical readout (shown in 9).

Figure 9. Drawing of the 1 cubic meter CYGNO apparatus.

One m3 of He/CF4 60/40 (1.6 kg) at atmospheric pressure subdivided in two 50 cm long
parts by the cathode with a drift field of about 1 kV/cm. Each gas volume is equipped by a
3√ó3 matrix with triple-GEM structure readout by:
‚Ä¢ a sCMOS sensor 65 cm away from a transparent window;
‚Ä¢ a fast light detector (PMT or SiPM).
The active apparatus will be contained in shields for gamma ray and neutrons.
CYGNO will behave as a demonstrator of the technology performance in order to prepare a
proposal for a 30-100 m3 experiment for Directional Dark Matter search in the low mass region
that can represent the first module of a World Wide Network of underground observatories in
the CYGNUS-TPC framework [12].
