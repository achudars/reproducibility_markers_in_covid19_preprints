Abstract
We consider a second order, two-point, singularly perturbed boundary value
problem, of reaction-convection-diffusion type with two small parameters, and we
obtain regularity results for its solution. First we establish classical differentiability
bounds that are explicit in the order of differentiation and the singular perturbation
parameters. Next, for small values of these parameters we show that the solution
can be decomposed into a smooth part, boundary layers at the two endpoints and
a negligible remainder. Derivative estimates are obtained for each component of
the solution, which again are explicit in the differentiation order and the singular
perturbation parameters.

Introduction

Singularly perturbed problems, and the numerical approximation of their solution, have
been studied extensively over the last few decades (see, e.g., the books [11], [12], [14]
and the references therein). As is well known, a main difficulty in these problems is the
presence of boundary layers in the solution, which appear due to fact that the limiting
problem (i.e. when the singular perturbation parameter(s) tend to 0), is of different order
than the original one, and the (‘extra’) boundary conditions can only be satisfied if the
solution varies rapidly in the vicinity of the boundary – hence the name boundary layers.
In most numerical methods, high order derivatives of the exact solution appear in the
error estimates, hence one should have a clear picture of how these derivatives grow with
respect to the singular perturbation parameter(s). For low order numerical methods,
such as Finite Differences (FD) or the h version of the Finite Element Method (FEM),
derivatives up to order 3 are usually sufficient. For high order methods such as the hp
version of the FEM, derivatives of arbitrary order are needed, thus knowing how these
behave with respect to the singular perturbation parameter(s) as well as the differentiation order, is necessary. Usually, problems of convection-diffusion or reaction-diffusion
type are studied separately and several researchers have proposed and analyzed numerical
schemes for the robust approximation of their solution (see, e.g., [14] and the references
therein). When there are two singular perturbation parameters present in the differential equation, the problem becomes reaction-convection-diffusion and the relationship
between the parameters determines the ‘regime’ we are in (as shown in Table 1 ahead).
In [3], the numerical solution to this problem was addressed, using the h version of the
FEM as well as appropriate finite differences (see also [1], [2], [4], [13], [15], [18], [19]).
Our interest is in high order hp FEM, hence we require information on all derivatives
of the solution. In the present article we obtain information about the regularity of the
solution, using the method of asymptotic expansions (see, e.g., [5]), thus taking the first
step towards an hp FEM for the approximation of such problems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we present the model
problem and its regularity in terms of classical differentiability. Section 3 contains the
asymptotic expansion for the solution, under the assumption that the singular perturbation parameters are small enough. We consider all possible relationships between the
singular perturbation parameters, and in Section 4 we establish derivative bounds which
are explicit in the differentiation order as well as the singular perturbation parameters,
for one case. Finally, in Section 5 we summarize our conclusions.
With I ⊂ R an interval with boundary ∂I and measure |I|, we will denote by C k (I)
the space of continuous functions on I with continuous derivatives up to order k. We
will use the usual Sobolev spaces W k,m (I) of functions on Ω with 0, 1, 2, ..., k generalized derivatives in Lm (I), equipped with the norm and seminorm k·kk,m,I and |·|k,m,I ,
respectively. When m = 2, we will write H k (I) instead of W k,2 (I), and for the norm
and seminorm, we will write k·kk,I and |·|k,I , respectively. The usual L2 (I) inner product
2

will be denoted by h·, ·iI , with the subscript omitted when there is no confusion. We will
also use the space

H01 (I) = u ∈ H 1 (I) : u|∂Ω = 0 .

The norm of the space L∞ (I) of essentially bounded functions is denoted by k · k∞,I .
Finally, the notation “a . b” means “a ≤ Cb” with C being a generic positive constant,
independent of any discretization or singular perturbation parameters. In fact, C will be
used throughout the manuscript to denote such a generic constant.

The model problem and its regularity

We consider the following model problem (cf. [10]): Find u such that
−ε1 u′′ (x) + ε2 b(x)u′ (x) + c(x)u(x) = f (x) , x ∈ I = (0, 1) ,
u(0) = u(1) = 0 ,

(1)
(2)

where 0 < ε1 , ε2 ≤ 1 are given parameters that can approach zero and the functions
b, c, f are given and sufficiently smooth. In particular, we assume that they are analytic
functions satisfying, for some positive constants γ f , γ c , γ b , independent of ε1 , ε2 ,
f (n)

. n!γ nf ,

c(n)

∞,I

. n!γ nc ,

b(n)

. n!γ nb ∀ n = 0, 1, 2, ... .

(3)

We also assume, as usual, that there exist constants β, γ, ρ, independent of ε1 , ε2 , such
that ∀ x ∈ I there holds
ε2
b(x) ≥ β > 0 , c(x) ≥ γ > 0 , c(x) − b′ (x) ≥ ρ > 0.
(4)

Assumption (4) ensures the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution. The solution
to (1), (2) satisfies (see, e.g., [3])
kuk∞,I . 1.
(5)
We would like to obtain a similar estimate for u′ . This is achieved in the following.

Lemma 1. Let u be the solution of (1), (2) and assume (3), (4) hold. Then

Using an inductive argument we are able to prove the following.
Theorem 2. Let u be the solution of (1), (2). Then there exist positive constants C, K,
independent of ε1 , ε2 , such that for n = 0, 1, 2, ...

Proof. The proof is by induction on n and follows [5]. Equation (5) and Lemma 1 give
the result for n = 0, 1, so we assume it holds for 0 ≤ ν ≤ n + 1 and show that it holds
for n + 2. Differentiating (1) n times gives

More details arise if one studies the structure of the solution to (1), which depends
on the roots of the characteristic equation associated with the differential operator. For
this reason, we let λ0 (x), λ1 (x) be the solutions of the characteristic equation (thinking
of the coefficients as constant) and set
µ0 = − max λ0 (x) , µ1 = min λ1 (x),
x∈[0,1]

The values of µ0 , µ1 determine the strength of the boundary layers and since |λ0 (x)| <
|λ1 (x)| the layer at x = 1 is stronger than the layer at x = 0. Essentially, there are three
regimes [3]:

convection-diffusion

It was shown in [3] (see also [15]) that under the assumptions b, c, f ∈ C q (I) for some
q ≥ 1 and ε2 q kb′ k∞,I . (1 − ℓ) for some ℓ ∈ (0, 1), the solution u to (1), (2) can be
decomposed into a smooth part S, a boundary layer part at the left endpoint E0 , and a
boundary layer part at the right endpoint E1 , viz.
u = S + E0 + E1 ,

for all x ∈ I and for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., q. This regularity result is sufficient for proving
convergence of a fixed order h FEM, but not for an hp FEM – a more refined regularity
6

result is needed for the smooth part that shows how the derivatives grow, with respect
to the differentiation order (cf. eq. (32) ahead).
The above considerations suggest the following two cases:
1. ε1 is large compared to ε2 : this is similar to a ‘typical perturbation’ of reactiondiffusion type. If one considers the limiting case ε2 = 0, then
 sees that there
 one
1/2
are two boundary layers, one at each endpoint, of width O ε1 . This situation
has been studied in the literature (see, e.g., [5]) and will not be considered further
in this article.
2. ε1 is small compared to ε2 : before discussing the different regimes, it is instructive to
consider the limiting case ε1 = 0. Then there is an exponential layer (of length scale
O(ε2 )) at the left endpoint. The homogeneous equation (with constant coefficients)
suggests that the different regimes are ε1 << ε22 , ε1 ≈ ε22 , ε1 >> ε22 .
−1
(a) In the regime ε1 << ε22 we have µ0 = O(ε−1
2 ) and µ1 = O(ε2 ε1 ). Hence
µ1 is much larger than µ0 and the boundary layer in the vicinity of x = 1 is
stronger. Consequently, there is a layer of width O(ε2 ) at the left endpoint
(the one that arose from the analysis of the case ε1 = 0) and additionally,
there is another layer at the right endpoint, of width O(ε1 /ε2 ).

(b) In the regime
ε1 ≈ ε22 there are layers at both endpoints of width O(ε2 ) =

1/2
O ε1 .
(c) In the regime
ε22 << ε1 << 1, there are layers at both endpoints of width

1/2
O ε1 .

The above information will be utilized in obtaining regularity estimates for the solution in all regimes. We close this section by presenting the variational (weak) formulation
of (1), (2), which follows after we multiply (1) by a test function v and integrate by parts
over I, taking advantage of the boundary conditions. We have the following problem:
Find u ∈ H01 (I) such that
B(u, v) = F (v) ∀ v ∈ H01 (I),
where the bilinear form B : H01 (I) × H01 (I) → R, is given by
Z
B(u, v) = {ε1 u′ (x)v ′ (x) + ε2 b(x)u′ (x)v(x) + c(x)u(x)v(x)} dx,
I

and the linear functional F : H01 (I) → R, by
Z
F (v) = f (x)v(x)dx.
I

7

(16)

(17)

Problem (16) has a unique solution for all f ∈ L2 (I), by the Lax-Milgram lemma.
Associated with the bilinear form (17) is the so-called energy norm
2

kwk2E = ε1 kw ′ k0,I + kwk21,I , w ∈ H01 (I),
and it is in this norm that numerical methods (e.g. FEM) achieve convergence. For this
reason, some estimates in Theorem 3 ahead are given in this norm.

The asymptotic expansion

3.1

The regime ε1 << ε22 << 1

In this case we anticipate a layer of width O(ε2 ) at the left endpoint and a layer of
width O (ε1 /ε2 ) at the right endpoint. To deal with this we define the stretched variables
x̃ = x/ε2 and x̂ = (1 − x)ε2 /ε1 , in order for the differentiation operator to produce the
necessary powers of ε1 , ε2 , that yield a balanced (in ε1 , ε2 ) equation.
Since we wish to improve upon (14), we want the solution to be comprised of a smooth
part (in the slow variable x), and two boundary layers (in the fast variables x̃, x̂). Hence,
we make the formal ansatz

Now there are layers at both endpoints of width O(ε2 ) and the BVP becomes reactiondiffusion as studied in [6]. So with x̃ = x/ε2 , x = (1 − x)/ε2 , we make, analogously as in

Regularity

In this section we formulate a result that gives explicit bounds on the derivatives of each
term in the decompositions (27), (29), and (31), respectively. We will only prove the case
of Regime 1, noting that the proofs for Regime 3 are almost identical, and Regime 2 has
been shown in [6].
Theorem 3. Assume (3), (4) hold. Then there exist positive constants K, K2 , K̃, K̂,

solution u of (1)–(2) can be decomposed as in (27), (29), (31), with the following bounds

Before we present the proof of the theorem (for Regime 1), we make some comments:
the estimates on the smooth part uM , explicitly show the dependence on the differentiation order; usually in the literature one only finds that the derivatives are simply bounded
[4]. Moreover, (32) shows that the smooth part is (real) analytic, hence a high order numerical method, e.g. the hp FEM, could yield exponential rates of convergence – the
estimate obtained is necessary for the proof. Finally, the bounds on the boundary layers
tell us how to design the mesh for the approximation, so that the negative powers of
ε1 , ε2 are eliminated. In fact, Theorem 3 allows for the proof of exponential convergence
(independently of ε1 , ε2 ) of hp FEM, as was done in [5] for reaction-diffusion BVPs.
We first present some auxiliary lemmas.
Lemma 4. Let ui,j be defined by (19) and assume (3) holds. Then there exist positive
constants C, K and a complex neighborhood G of I, such that the complex extension of u
(denoted again by u) satisfies
|ui,j (z)| ≤ Cδ −i K i ii ∀ z ∈ Gδ = {z ∈ G : dist(z, ∂G) > δ} .
Proof. The proof is by induction on i. The case i = 0 holds trivially, so assume the
result holds for
 i and establish it for i + 1. Let κ ∈ (0, 1) and let K > 0 be a constant so
2
1
that K 2 + K ≤ 1. We have by (19), the induction hypothesis with G(1−κ)δ ⊃ Gδ , and
Cauchy’s Integral Theorem,


Conclusions

We considered a two-point, singularly perturbed, reaction-convection-diffusion problem
with analytic data, and we derived analytic regularity results for its solution. Based
on the relationship between the singular perturbation parameters, the problem becomes
convection-diffusion, reaction-diffusion or reaction-convection-diffusion, as shown in Table 1. We provided estimates for all three cases (regimes), which reveal the analytic
nature of the solution and derived derivative bounds which are explicit in the differentiation order as well as the singular perturbation parameters. Such estimates are necessary
for the construction and analysis of high order numerical methods (e.g. hp FEM [17] ,
Isogeometric Analysis [20]).
