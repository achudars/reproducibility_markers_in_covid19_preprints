We investigate weak lensing effect on cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the presence
of dipole anisotropy. The approach of flat-sky approximation is considered. We determine the
functions σ02 and σ22 that appear in expressions of the lensed CMB power spectrum in the presence
of a dipole anisotropy. We determine the correction to B-mode power spectrum which is found to
be appreciable at low multipoles (l). However, the temperature and E-mode power spectrum are
not altered significantly.

INTRODUCTION

In unveiling the dynamics and contents of the universe, cosmic microwave background radiation has been one
of the essential tools. CMB constrains cosmological parameters, and it provides a path in developing modern
cosmology. The precision level of the experiments for the CMB spectrum and hence the accuracy of prediction of
a theoretical model have been increasing year by year. The CMB anisotropy can be determined by the Physics of
last scattering surface (LSS) and the medium effects due to the propagation of photons from LSS to the observer.
The primary contribution to the anisotropy is due to the strength of the metric perturbations at LSS. Some other
effects such as ISW effect, reionization, quadrupole distributions give additional modifications. Lensing is an effect
which is associated with the geodesics of photons from LSS to us. It can be considered as a secondary contribution
in modifying CMB anisotropy, and it must be taken into account to reliably predict the CMB signal. The lensing
gives a very small contribution on the reionization and the ISW signal as these are associated with the large scale.
However, on degree-scale of primary acoustic peaks, weak lensing effect is expected at the order of arc minute on the
CMB spectrum [1].
In this paper, we are interested in the weak lensing effect on the CMB spectrum arising due to a dipole distribution
in the Newtonian potential. The unexpected observation of anisotropy at large scale leads us to study the implications
of such model. In WMAP data, some of the anomalies were discovered [2]. These anomalies include the alignment
between low multipoles [3–5], large cold spot in the southern hemisphere [6–8], hemisphere power asymmetry [9].
The Planck data has further confirmed the existence of such anomalies [10]. According to Planck data, the dipole
modulation of power lies in the range l = 2 − 600 at 1.1 − 3.5σ. In addition, it confirmed octopole-quadrupole
alignment at 98% level and a power deficit below l = 40. Other observables, such as, radio polarization from radio
galaxies and optical polarization of quasars also indicate anisotropy at the large scale. Remarkably, orientations of
dipole axis of radio polarization [11], dipole, quadrupole and octopole axes of the CMB [13] and the direction of
alignment of the pattern of two-point correlation in the optical polarization [12] all point towards the Virgo direction.
The model with dipole anisotropy we study in this paper is proposed by Gordon [14]. It has also been studied in Refs.
[15–17]. Furthermore, the CMB spectrum have been investigated in Refs. [18–20] in this model. In this paper, we
study weak lensing effect on the CMB spectrum with the flat-sky approximation [21]. In Sec. (II), we generalize the

two-point correction function due to the weak lensing with the dipole anisotropy. In this section, we also calculate
the expectation value of a term which arises due to the isotropic part of lensing potential. In Sec. (III), we estimate
the modification to this term in presence of the dipole anisotropy. In Sec. (IV), we obtain expressions for CMB power
spectrum. In Sec. (V), we conclude.

GRAVITATIONAL LENSING EFFECT ON TWO-POINT CORRELATION FUNCTIONS IN THE
PRESENCE OF DIPOLE ANISOTROPY

The observed CMB spectrum is different from that produced at LSS due to the lensing effect. These are related as
[21]
X(θ) = X̃(θ + δθ)

where, X(θ) is the observed physical quantity such as the temperature T (θ), the stokes parameters Q(θ) and U (θ)
etc., whereas X̃(θ + δθ) is the corresponding physical quantity produced at LSS. Writing these variables in the explicit
form, we have,
T (θ) = T̃ (θ + δθ)

where, the standard definitions of Q(l) and U (l) are used. Using above Eqs. (2), (3) and (4), we can compute
correlation function of such quantities at two points θ1 and θ2 . In general, these two points can be anywhere on the
two dimensional plane in small scale limit formalism. However for simplicity, we rotate our frame such that these two
points fall on x−axis. We can also shift θ1 at θ1 = 0 or θ2 at θ2 = 0 keeping other point at the separation of θ. Now,
the correlation function corresponding to the temperature is given by,
CT (θ) = < T (θ1 )T (θ2 ) >
= < T̃ (θ 1 + δθ1 )T̃ (θ2 + δθ2 ) >

where, we have used
< Ỹ (l)Ỹ (l′ ) >= (2π)2 C̃Y l δ 2 (l − l′ ).

(6)

The vector quantity l which is conjugate to θ makes the angle φl with the x−axis. In the similar way, we obtain the
following relation for CQ (θ) and CU (θ),
Z
d2 l ilθ cos φl il·(δθ 1 −δθ2 )

The quantity heil·(δθ1 −δθ2 ) i is important since the weak lensing effect with the dipole anisotropy is involved here.
We compute this quantity following Ref. [21] by adding the dipole matter distribution. Let us define the deflection
angles as α = δθ1 and α′ = δθ2 . The deflection angle is given by,
α = ∇n̂ ψ(n̂),

(8)

where, ∇n̂ is angular derivative, n̂ is direction of observation and ψ(n̂) is lensing potential and it is connected to
gravitational potential ψ(χn̂, η0 − χ) via,

ψ(η̂) ≡ −2

Z

fK (χ∗ − χ)
ψ(χn̂, η0 − χ),

(9)

where, χ∗ is conformal distance of LSS from us. In our case, the gravitational potential has two parts, the homogeneous
part ψ h and part ψ d corresponding to dipole distribution:
ψ = ψh + ψd .

(10)

Expanding ψ h by Fourier expansion, we have

ψ(θ) =

Z

d2 leil·θ ψ hl + ψ d .

(11)

Now we calculate the correlation tensor,
hαi α′j i = h∇i ψ∇j ψ ′ i.

(12)

Using above Eq. (12), we obtain
hαi α′j i = h∇i ψ∇j ψ ′ i,
= h∇i ψ h ∇j ψ ′h i + h∇i ψ d ∇j ψ ′d i,

j i. The correlation function hαi αj i should be proportional to δij and the trace-free tensor given by

Now we come to the term heil·(α−α ) i in which we are interested in order to understand the lensing effects including
dipole matter distribution. It can be shown that [1]

heil·(α−α ) i = e− 2 h[l·(α−α )] i .

h[l · (α − α′ )]2 i = li lj h(α − α′ )i (α − α′ )j i

(18)

4
We obtain the terms due to homogeneous part as well as dipole part, since hαi αj i, hα′i α′j i and hαi α′j i all have two
parts as in Eq. (13). Homogeneous part becomes
h

h[l · (α − α′ )]2 ih = l2 Cgl (0) − Cgl (θ) + cos(2φl )Cgl,2 (θ) ,
h

(19)
= l2 σ02 (θ) + σ22 (θ) cos(2φl ) ,
where, we define σ02 (θ) = Cgl (0) − Cgl (θ) and σ22 (θ) = Cgl,2 . These notations, σ02 (θ) and σ22 (θ), have been used in the
literature [21].

DIPOLE ANISOTROPY CORRECTION

In this section, we estimate first the correction to h[l · (α − α′ )]2 i due to the dipole distribution. In Eq. (13), the
additional second term is due to the dipole. To calculate it, we expand ψ d in 3-dimensional Fourier space as follows

Here, η is the conformal time at the point of observation. ∇i has two components corresponding to the directions

respectively. Summing all the terms, we obtain the total contribution, which is given by,
β 2 ω1 ω2 κ2 δix δjx cos (κω1 sin θ1 ) cos (κω2 sin θ2 )

(30)

As already mentioned, we may shift one point to the pole. Here we shift the one point to the pole by making θ2 → 0.
We can also now redefine θ1 as only θ, therefore, above term can be written as,
β 2 ω1 ω2 κ2 δix δjx cos (κω1 sin θ).
Now we integrate this term with respect to conformal time by recalling ω =

We observe that the dipole anisotropy modifies the quantities Cgl (0) − Cgl (θ) (≡ σ02 ) and Cgl,2 (≡ σ22 ) with equal

In Eq. (36), we note that the term is similar as we get in the standard lensing. The only difference here is that all

the effects of anisotropy are absorbed in σ0T

. In Fig. (1), on the left panel, we plot σ02 , σ22 which are due to standard weak lensing. The function σd2 due to
dipole distribution is also plotted. We considered β = 1 and κ = 0.046 satisfying the constraint |κ3s β| ≤ 1.26 × 10−5H03
or |κ3 β| ≤ 10−4 [17], where, H0 is Hubble constant. This provides with an estimate of maximum possible change that
can arise due to the dipole. We observe a reasonable value of σd2 comparable to σ02 . The contribution of σd2 appears in
l′
l′
the B-mode spectrum. Dipole distribution marginally decreases its value due to the presence of function W11
− W11
.
In the right panel of Fig. (1), we plot the B-mode power spectrum including the dipole contribution. The standard
weak lensing result is shown for comparison. In plotting the lensed CBl , we use unlensed C̃Bl = 0 and C̃El from
CAMB package. We restrict this curve for l > 10 for which the Flat sky approximation is expected to be reliable [23].
We find that the dipole contribution leads to a small downward shift of the spectrum at low values of l. The shift is
large at low l and roughly 1% at l of order 40. Hence it is small but not negligible. Some of the numerical values

is oscillatory as well as symmetric. Therefore, we do not get any contribution to the CEl due to the dipole
l′
distribution. Similarly, W11
forms a nearly symmetric pattern (see Fig. (3)) and it does not give any change to CT l
in the standard weak lensing modification due to dipole anisotropy.

CONCLUSIONS

We generalized the formalism of weak lensing by adding dipole anisotropy in the Newtonian potential. We estimated
the effect of lensing on the CMB power spectrum in this model. We followed the approach of the flat sky approximation.
Weak lensing mixes E and B mode and hence we necessarily find some contribution to CBl due to weak lensing. The
correction to CBl is proportional to C̃El . We observed that adding dipole anisotropy changes CBl for the lower range
of l. However, dipole anisotropy does not lead to an appreciable change in CEl , since the correction is much smaller
than the leading order term C̃El . ′We did′ not even observe any change in the standard weak lensing modification due
l
l
to the dipole anisotropy, since W11
+ W11
has a symmetric pattern. The same argument applies to CT l . In the case of
l′
l′
CBl we obtain a correction since in this case the leading order C̃Bl is zero and W11
− W11
are not symmetric. For this
case we computed the maximum possible correction to CBl by fixing the direction of dipole to be same as the direction
of observation. A more reliable calculation would use the spherical harmonics approach. Flat sky approximation and
the spherical harmonics approach deviate below l = 10 [23]. Thus, our calculation is reliable for l > 10, where we still
find a small correction to CBl .
