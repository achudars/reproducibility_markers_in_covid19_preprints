To account for the dark matter content in our Universe, post-inflationary scenarios predict for the
QCD axion a mass in the range (10 − 103 ) µeV. Searches with haloscope experiments in this mass
range require the monitoring of resonant cavity modes with frequency above 5 GHz, where several
experimental limitations occur due to linear amplifiers, small volumes, and low quality factors of
Cu resonant cavities. In this paper we deal with the last issue, presenting the result of a search
for galactic axions using a haloscope based on a 36 cm3 NbTi superconducting cavity. The cavity
worked at T = 4 K in a 2 T magnetic field and exhibited a quality factor Q0 = 4.5 × 105 for the
TM010 mode at 9 GHz. With such values of Q the axion signal is significantly increased with respect
to copper cavity haloscopes. Operating this setup we set the limit gaγγ < 1.03 × 10−12 GeV−1 on
the axion photon coupling for a mass of about 37 µeV. A comprehensive study of the NbTi cavity
at different magnetic fields, temperatures, and frequencies is also presented.

INTRODUCTION

The axion is a pseudoscalar particle predicted by
S. Weinberg [1] and F. Wilczek [2] as a consequence of the
mechanism introduced by R.D. Peccei and H. Quinn [3]
to solve the “strong CP problem”. Axions are also
well motivated dark-matter (DM) candidates with expected mass laying in a broad range from peV to few
meV [4]. Post-inflationary scenarios restrict this range
to (10 − 103 ) µeV [4], where a rich experimental program
will probe the axion existence in the next decade. Among
the experiments, ADMX [5], HAYSTAC [6], ORGAN [7],
CULTASK [8] and KLASH [9] will use a haloscope, i.e.
a detector composed of a resonant cavity immersed in
a strong magnetic field as proposed by P. Sikivie [10].
When the resonant frequency of the cavity νc is tuned

where ρa = 0.45 GeV/cm3 is the local DM density, α is
the fine-structure constant, Λ = 78 MeV is a scale parameter related to hadronic physics, and gγ is a model
dependent parameter equal to −0.97 (0.36) in the KSVZ
(DFSZ) axion model [11, 12]. It is related to the coupling appearing in the Lagrangian gaγγ = (gγ α/πΛ2 )ma .

QL = Q0 /(1 + β), where Q0 is the unloaded quality factor; here Cmnl ' O(1) is a geometrical factor depending
on the cavity mode.
The axion mass range studied by haloscopes up to now
is limited to few µeV. Exploring larger ranges at higher
values requires the excitation of modes with frequency
above a few GHz where several experimental limitations
occur: (i ) the technology of linear amplifier limits the
sensitivity [13]; (ii ) conversion volumes are smaller since
the normal modes resonant frequencies are inversely proportional to the cavity radius; and (iii ) the anomalous
skin effect reduces the copper cavities quality factor at

2
high frequencies. Solutions to the first two issues are
proposed for instance in [14] and [15], respectively.
The optimum value of Q-factor for haloscopes is ∼ 106 ,
as estimated by the coherence time of DM axions [16]. A
10 GHz copper cavity, cooled at cryogenic temperature,
barely reaches Q ∼ 105 , a value that rapidly decreases
with increasing frequency. In this paper we present a
substantial improvement obtained for the quality factor
with a “superconducting haloscope” composed of a superconducting cavity (SCC) operated in high magnetic
fields. This activity has been done within the QUAX
experiment, which searches DM axions using a ferromagnetic haloscope [16, 17]. The same experimental apparatus can be used as a Sikivie’s haloscope [10] exploiting
the TM010 mode of the cylindrical cavity. In this work
we substitute the copper cavity with a superconducting
one, to increase the quality factor and thus the measurement sensitivity. We refer to the Primakoff haloscope of
the QUAX collaboration as “QUAX−aγ”.
In Sec. II we describe the characterization of the SCC
and the measurement setup, while in Sec. III we present
the results of the axion search done by operating the SCC
in magnetic field and the corresponding exclusion limit
on the coupling gaγγ . Finally, in Sec. IV we discuss the
future prospects of the QUAX−aγ experiment for the
Primakoff axion search.

EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS
A.

Superconducting cavity

To increase the quality factor and match the optimal
condition for the coupling to cosmological axions, it is
natural to consider SCCs as they were widely studied
in accelerator physics. However, in axion searches these
are operated in strong magnetic fields that, on the one
hand, weaken superconductivity and, on the other, are
screened by the superconducting material. To overcome
both these limitations we designed a cavity divided in
two halves, each composed by a Type II superconducting
body and copper endcaps. Type II superconductors are
infact known to have a reduced sensitivity to the applied
magnetic field. Moreover, magnetic field penetration in
the inner cavity volume may be facilitated by interrupting the screening supercurrents with the insertion of a
thin (30 µm) copper layer between the two halves.
The cavity layout is shown in the upper part of Fig. 1,
featuring two identical copper semi-cells with cylindrical body and conical endcaps to reduce current dissipation at interfaces. The cylindrical body is 50 mm long
with diameter 26.1 mm, while the cones are 19.5 mm long.
For the detection of axions through its interaction with
the electron spin [17], part of the cylinder was flattened
to break the angular symmetry and prevent the degeneration of mode TM110. A finite element calculation
performed with ANSYS HFSS [18] of the TM010 mode
used for Primakoff axion detection gives a frequency

9.08 GHz TM010 mode in arbitary amplitude units, while the
lower photo is one of the two halves of the superconducting
cavity.

νcsim = 9.08 GHz and a coefficient Cmnl = 0.589 in a
volume V = 36.43 cm3 . The calculated field profile of
this mode is shown in Fig. 1. Because of this hybrid geometry, the quality factor is expressed as

where Rs are the surface resistances. The simulation
yields Gcones = 6270.11 Ω and Gcyl = 482.10 Ω. At
9 GHz and 4 K temperature the surface resistance for Cu
is RsCu = 4.9 mΩ [19]. A pure Cu cavity with this geom4
etry would have QCu

with copper cones and no losses on the cylindrical surface
would have Qmax
= Gcones /RsCu ' 1.3 × 106 .

To test this promising simulation results, a prototype
of the cavity was fabricated as shown in the lower part
of Fig. 1. The inner cylindrical part of the cavity was
coated by means of a 10 cm planar magnetron equipped
with a NbTi target. The estimated coating thickness
ranges between 3 to 4 µm. To minimize the losses due to
the interaction of fluxons [20] with the superconducting
microwave-current, only the cylindrical body, where the
currents of the mode TM010 are parallel to the applied
field, were coated as evidenced by the different colors of
the lower picture of Fig. 1.
We characterized the cavity in a thermally controlled
gas-flow cryostat equipped with an 8 T superconducting magnet located at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati
(LNF). No copper layer was inserted between the two
halves. Two tunable antennas were coupled to the cavity mode and connected through coax cables to a Vector
Network Analyzer for the measurement of the reflection
and transmission waveforms, S11 (ν) and S12 (ν). The unloaded quality factor Q0 was extracted from a simultaneous fit of the two waveforms. An expected system-

tribution within the Gittleman and Rosenblum (GR)
model [23, 24]. In particular, the depinning frequency [23]
was estimated to be about 44 GHz. Below this frequency,
losses due to vortex motion are suppressed, while they
are maximal at higher frequency where the flux-flow resistivity reaches the value ρff = cff ρn B/Bc2 . Here, B
is the applied DC field, cff = 0.044 is a correction taking into account mutual orientation of fluxons and microwave currents, ρn = 7.0 × 10−7 Ωm is NbTi resistivity

in the normal state and Bc2 = 13 T × 1 − (T /Tc )2 is
the temperature dependent critical field [22]. Comparing
the surface resistance derived from the GR model with
these parameters and the anomalous surface resistance of
Cu we estimated, for different values of the applied field,
the crossing frequency for which the losses in NbTi are
equal to the losses in Cu. The result is shown in Fig. 3.
At T = 4.2 K the NbTi cavity is expected to show lower
losses up to an applied field of about 4.5 T. For higher
fields the crossing frequency rapidly decreases down to
45 GHz for B = 6 T. By lowering the temperature down
to 100 mK we expect a 20% improvement of the Q0 and
larger values for the crossing frequency. In fact, at this
temperature the critical field Bc2 reaches its maximum
value, 13 T, reducing the flux-flow resistivity.

atic error of ±5% follows from the fit procedure. At
4.2 K and no applied external magnetic field we measured Q0 = 1.2 × 106 in agreement with the maximal
expected value Qmax
and corresponding to a surface re0
sistance of the NbTi RsNbTi = (20 ± 20) µΩ. We repeated
the measurement for different values of the applied magnetic field in the range 0 − 5 T both in zero-field cooling
(ZFC) and field cooling (FC), thus reducing the temperature of the cavity without or with external magnetic
field, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 2. For
B = 2 T, the nominal field used in our axion search, we
measured Q20 T = 4.5 × 105 , a factor ∼ 5 better than a
bulk Cu cavity; at 5 T we measured Q50 T = 2.95 × 105 ,
a factor ∼ 3.3 better than a Cu cavity. Comparing FC
and ZFC measurements, we observe a systematic difference below about 0.5 T due to magnetic field trapping
in the superconducting material. For higher values the
measurements agree within the errors showing that the
magnetic field is able to penetrate the cavity walls and
that the superconductor is in the flux flow state [21].
In a recent analysis [22], the variation of the surface
resistance of this cavity with the magnetic field was
interpreted taking into account the vortex-motion con-

Magnet and readout electronics

A replica of the cavity described in Sec. II A was
mounted in the experimental site at Laboratori Nazionali
di Legnaro (LNL), which hosts an apparatus capable to
search for galactic axions [17]. The scheme of the appara-

4
tus is shown in Fig. 4. The SCC is inside a vacuum chamber inserted in a superconducting magnet. The magnet
is a NbTi compensated solenoid, 15 cm bore and 50 cm
height, generating a central field of 2 T with homogeneity better than 20 ppm on a 20 mm-long line along the
central axis. A superconducting switch is installed to
perform measurements also in persistent current mode.
The bias current of 50 A is supplied by a high-stability
current generator. The magnet and the vacuum chamber
are immersed in a LHe bath at the temperature of 4.2 K.
The cavity is instrumented with two antennas, a weakly
coupled one was used to inject probe signals in the cavity
with a source oscillator (SO). The second antenna, with
a variable coupling, is connected through a coax cable
to a low noise cryogenic HEMT amplifier (A1) with gain
G1 ' 40 dB. Before reaching the amplifier the coax cable
is connected to a cryogenic switch and then to an isolator. The switch, used for calibration purposes, allows the
replacement of the cavity output with the output of a resistor (RJ ). The temperature of the resistor is kept constant by a heater and read by a thermometer. The setup
is completed by a second FET amplifier (A2) at room
temperature with gain G2 ' 39 dB and a down-converter
mixer referenced to a local oscillator (LO). The in-phase

are further magnified by two identical room temperature
amplifiers (A3I,Q ) with G3 ' 50 dB each and acquired
by a 16 bit ADC sampling at 2 MHz. The acquisition
program controls both the oscillators, the ADC and the
applied magnetic field. Three thermometers monitor the
temperature of the cavity, of the resistance RJ and of the
amplifier A1, with typical temperatures of Tc = 4.3 K,
TJ = 4.5 K and Ta = 5.1 K, respectively.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

With the LNL setup described in Sec. II we performed
the first search for galactic axions using a SCC. The
frequency of the TM010 cavity mode, νc = 9.07 GHz,
was in good agreement with the simulated value νcsim =
9.08 GHz. A copper layer was used to interrupt circular
screening-supercurrents and allow magnetic field penetration. No impact was observed on the quality factor,
since the longitudinal microwave currents of the TM010
mode are unaffected by the interposed mask. The penetration of the magnetic field in the cavity volume was
verified by means of a 1 mm YIG sphere positioned on
the cavity axis with a teflon holder. Hybridization of the
sphere ferromagnetic-resonance with the TM110 mode
at 14 GHz occurs with a field of 0.5 T, showing a typical double resonance curve whose Lorentzian peaks have
linewidths equal to the average of the YIG and cavity
linewidths. The observation of this effect confirmed that
the field distortotion were at the level of 100 ppm or lower
over the sphere volume. Measurements in the dispersive
regime, i. e. with ferromagnetic resonance frequency different from the cavity one, also gave similar results.
To down-convert and acquire the signal, the frequency
of the local oscillator fed to the mixer was set to νLO =
νc −500 kHz, and the I and Q components were combined
to extract the right part of the down-converted spectra,
where the cavity resonance lies. We determined the total
gain G and the noise temperature Tn of the amplification
chain by heating the resistor RJ from about 4.5 to 8.5 K
and by measuring the temperature and the corresponding
Johnson noise [25]. The resulting values are
Tn = (11.0 ± 0.1) K,
G = (1.96 ± 0.01) × 1012 .

We set the magnetic field to 2 T and measured the
cavity quality factor Q0 = 4.02 × 105 , compatible within
the errors with our previous measurment. Finally, we
critically coupled the tunable antenna and measured the
loaded quality factor QL = 2.01 × 105 . With high quality
factors the temperature stability of the system is a critical
issue: in fact we observed a drift of the cavity resonance
frequency of the order of the linewidth in the timescale
of an hour. Thus the integration time was limited to
∆t = 20 min. The collected data were analyzed with a
FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) with a resolution bandwidth of ∆ν = 7812.5 Hz close to the axion linewidth,

to maximize the SNR in a single bin. The resulting
9375000 FFTs were RMS averaged, and the bins with
disturbances introduced by the low-frequency electronics
were excluded from the analysis. The power spectrum
was fit using a degree 5 polynomial to account for the
off-resonance part of the spectra, which are due to the
non-uniform gain of ADC and amplifiers. We modeled
the on resonance spectrum with the absorption profile of
a Lorentzian curve. Since the temperature of the cavity was lower than the one of the isolator, the spectrum
of power reflected by the cavity shows a minimum at
the resonance frequency. The measured spectrum with
fit and residuals are shown in Fig. 5. The residuals are
distributed according to a Gaussian probability √
density
function and their standard deviation scales as ∆t as
expected. To get the equivalent power at the cavity output we divide the power measured at the ADC input by
the total measured gain G in Eq. 3. Its standard deviation is σP = 6.19 × 10−22 W. This value is compatible

CONCLUSIONS

SCCs appear as a natural choice for high frequency
haloscopes as their quality factor matches the one of
cosmological axions. In this work, we characterized a
SCC by testing it under a high magnetic field at cryogenic temperature. After successful tests, we performed
a single-mass axion search, extracting an upper limit on
gaγγ for a narrow frequency band. This result is limited
by the low magnetic field, the high system temperature
and the small cavity volume. A new experimental setup
is now in preparation consisting of a dilution refrigerator, a quantum limited Josephson Parametric Amplifier
(JPA) and an 8 T superconducting magnet. At 50 mK
with a quantum limited amplifier, such as a JPA, the
system temperature is reduced to about 400 mK. Operating a 20 cm long NbTi-cavity in a 5 T magnetic
field, we expect, from our measurements, a quality factor
Q50 T,50 mK = 2.95 × 1.2 × 105 = 3.54 × 105 , a factor 4 better than a copper cavity. With this setup, the expected
95% exclusion limit would be gaγγ < 4×10−14 GeV−1 for
ma ' 37.5 µeV a value that touches the region expected
for KSVZ axions.
