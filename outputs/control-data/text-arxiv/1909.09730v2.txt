ABSTRACT

We present results from a full general relativistic three-dimensional hydrodynamics
simulation of rapidly rotating core-collapse of a 70 M star with three-flavor spectral
neutrino transport. We find a strong gravitational wave (GW) emission that originates
from the growth of the one- and two-armed spiral waves extending from the nascent
proto-neutron star (PNS). The GW spectrogram shows several unique features that
are produced by the non-axisymmetric instabilities. After bounce, the spectrogram
first shows a transient quasi-periodic time modulation at ∼ 450 Hz. In the second
active phase, it again shows the quasi-periodic modulation but with the peak frequency
increasing with time, which continues until the final simulation time. From our detailed
analysis, such features can be well explained by a combination of the so-called lowT/|W | instability and the PNS core contraction.

INTRODUCTION

The LIGO and Virgo collaborations have opened a new window on the gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. The detailed analyses of the GW signal from compact binary coalescences have constrained not only the binary parameters
but also physical quantities related to the neutron star (NS)
physics such as the radii and nuclear equation of state (EOS)
(Abbott et al. 2019).
Some of the binary black holes (BHs) detected by GWs
have their masses of ∼30-50 M , indicating their formation
in low metalicity environments (e.g., Abbott et al. 2016).
Recently, an astronomical observation of Liu et al. (2019)
reported the detection of a ∼70M BH in a binary system
(“LB-1”) with its companion being an ∼8 M solar metalicity
B star. These findings motivate not only theoretical studies
on the formation channels of these massive BHs (e.g., Belczynski et al. 2019, see, however, Abdul-Masih et al. 2019;
Eldridge et al. 2019; El-Badry & Quataert 2019) , but also
numerical simulation studies clarifying the hydrodynamics
processes of the massive BH formation (e.g., Chan et al.
2018; Kuroda et al. 2018).
Next to the compact binary coalescence, core collapse
(CC) of massive stars and the subsequent explosions have
been considered one of the most promising GW sources. Extensive studies have revealed that the candidate ingredients
of GW emission from stellar CC include prompt convection,

neutrino-driven convection, proto-neutron star (PNS) convection, g/ f -mode oscillation of the PNS, the standing accretion shock instability, rotational flattening of the bouncing core, and non-axisymmetric rotational instabilities (for
reviews, see Fryer & New 2011; Kotake & Kuroda 2016).
Among these multiple physical elements, progenitor rotation has been long considered the primary ingredient that
leads to the sizable GWs (Müller 1982).
In three-dimensional (3D) simulations of rapidly rotating CC, the growth of non-axisymmetric rotational instabilities that develop later in the postbounce phase has been
reported (Ott et al. 2005, 2007; Scheidegger et al. 2008b,
2010; Kuroda et al. 2014; Takiwaki et al. 2016; Takiwaki &
Kotake 2018). These studies have shown that the so-called
low-T/|W | instability (Watts et al. 2005; Saijo & Yoshida
2006), where T/|W | is the ratio of the rotational to gravitational potential energy, plays a key role for the growth
of the non-axisymmetric flows that extend outward in the
vicinity of the PNS. Since the stability criterion depends on
the compactness of the PNS, it is important to include general relativity (GR) and self-consistent neutrino transport
in 3D rapidly rotating CC simulations. This was already
pointed out by Ott et al. (2007, 2012); Kuroda et al. (2014)
with different levels of sophistication for neutrino treatment.
So far 3D simulations of rapidly rotating collapse that followed a long-term postbounce evolution with spectral neu-

trino transport have been reported in Takiwaki et al. (2016)
and Obergaulinger & Aloy (2019), but with the assumption
of Newtonian and post-Newtonian gravity, respectively.
In this Letter, we present a first 3D full-GR hydrodynamics simulation of rapidly rotating CC of a 70 M
star with spectral neutrino transport, where we follow the
longest postbounce evolution (∼ 270 ms after bounce) in this
context. Our results confirm that the growth of the nonaxisymmetric instability leads to long-lasting quasi-periodic
GW emission. As a new intriguing result, the characteristic
GW frequency increases with time. Such a ramp-up feature
of the GW frequency may look similar to that from the g/ f mode oscillation of the non-rotating PNS (Murphy et al.
2009; Müller et al. 2013; Vartanyan et al. 2019). However,
in rapidly rotating CC, we show that the ramp-up feature
(with much bigger GW amplitudes) is produced predominantly because of the growth of the low-T/|W | instability
and the PNS contraction.

NUMERICAL METHOD AND SETUP

The numerical schemes of our 3D-GR simulation are essentially the same as those in Kuroda et al. (2016), except the
update where we adopt the directionally unsplit predictorcorrector scheme instead of the use of Strang splitting. Based
on the BSSN formalism, we solve the metric evolution in
fourth-order accuracy by a finite-difference scheme in space
and with a Runge-Kutta method in time . We consider
three-flavor of neutrinos (ν ∈ νe, ν̄e, νx ) with νx denoting
heavy-lepton neutrinos. Employing an M1 analytical closure scheme (Shibata et al. 2011), we solve spectral neutrino
transport of the radiation energy and momentum including
all the gravitational red- and Doppler-shift terms using 12
energy bins from 1 to 300 MeV. Regarding neutrino opacities, the standard weak interaction set in Bruenn (1985) plus
nucleon-nucleon Bremsstrahlung is taken into account (see
Kuroda et al. (2016) for more detail).
We use a 70 M zero-metallicity star of Takahashi et al.
(2014). At the precollapse phase, the mass of the central iron
core is ∼ 4.6 M and the enclosed mass up to the helium
layer is ∼ 34 M . The central density profile of this progenitor is similar to that of 75 M ultra metal-poor progenitor
model of Woosley et al. (2002) that is used as a collapsar
model in Ott et al. (2011). The central angular frequency
of the original progenitor model is ∼ 0.03 rad s−1 , by which
one can roughly estimate the T/|W | at bounce as ∼ 10−5
due to the angular momentum conservation. For such slow
rotation, it is very unlikely to produce non-axisymmetric
rotational instabilities, and the GW signature would not be
significantly deviated from those from a non-rotating model.
Therefore, to explore the impact of rotation, we assume a
rapidly rotating iron core with the central angular velocity
being 2 rad s−1 (e.g., as taken in Scheidegger et al. 2008a;
Ott et al. 2011). For reference, the initial rotational energy
and T/|W | are ∼ 1.3 × 1045 ergs and ∼ 2 × 10−7 for the original
progenitor model and are ∼ 2.6 × 1049 ergs and ∼ 3 × 10−3
for the rapidly rotating model explored in this work, respectively.
We use the EOS by Lattimer & Swesty (1991) with
a bulk incompressibility modulus of K = 220 MeV (LS220).
The 3D computational domain is a cubic box with 15,000 km

width, and nested boxes with nine refinement levels are embedded in the Cartesian coordinates. Each box contains 643
cells and the minimum grid size near the origin is ∆x = 458m.
The PNS core surface (∼ 10 km) and stalled shock (∼ 110300km)are resolved by ∆x = 458m and 7.3 km, respectively.
In the numerical analysis below, we extract GWs with a
standard quadrupole formula including GR corrections (Shibata & Sekiguchi 2003; Kuroda et al. 2014). The GW spectrograms are obtained using short-term Fourier transformation with a Hann window, whose width is set as 20 ms. tpb
represents the time measured after core bounce.

RESULT

We begin with a brief description of the post-bounce dynamical evolution in our simulation. The central density reaches
∼ 3.6×1014 g cm−3 at core bounce. After core bounce and the
subsequent ring-down oscillation, the central density monotonically increases up to ∼5×1014 g cm−3 at the end of the
simulation (tpb = 270 ms). The bounce shock propagates
outward to reach ∼ 200 km at tpb ∼ 70 ms. As we will see
later, the low-T/|W | instability takes place at this time and
temporally accelerates the shock. But once the instability
ceases, the shock propagation decelerates and stagnates at
∼ 300 km at tpb ∼ 85 ms. Afterward the shock surface starts
shrinking. The shrink stops at tpb ∼ 100 ms, and later the
average shock radius keeps ∼ 200 km until the end of our
simulation.
Fig. 1 shows the GW strain h (top panels) and the spectrograms of the characteristic strain (hchar , bottom panels,
see the definition of equation (44) in Kuroda et al. 2014)
for a source distance of D =10 kpc. For convenience, we
denote h+ (red solid line) and h× (blue dashed line) with
subscripts I and I I, corresponding to the (reference) viewing direction either along the rotational axis (the positive
z-axis, right panels) or equatorial plane (the positive x-axis,
left panels), respectively. After core bounce and the subsequent ring-down phase, the waveforms show a quasi-periodic
time modulation around tpb ∼ 70 ms. This can be seen as a
clear excess in the spectrograms with the peak frequency of
f ∼ 450 Hz. The GW amplitude is more strongly emitted
toward the pole than the equator. The waveforms show that
this lasts only for the duration of ∼ 20 ms followed by a
quiescent phase until tpb ∼ 110 ms, after which the quasiperiodic GW emission becomes active again.
In the second active phase, the GW emission does not
subside quickly as seen in the first phase. The spectrograms
clearly show that the peak GW frequency, either seen from
the equator or pole, increases with time from f ∼ 450 Hz
at tpb ∼ 120 ms to ∼ 800 Hz at the end of our simulation
time (tpb ∼ 270 ms). Seen from the pole, the phase difference between h+ and h× is π/2. Furthermore, the GW
amplitudes seen from the pole are approximately two times
bigger than those from the equator, i.e., h+/×, I ∼ 2h+,I I , and
the cross mode of the GWs seen from the equator (h×, I I )
is significantly smaller than the plus mode (h+,I I ) . These
GW features are consistent with previous 3D studies where
the growth of non-axisymmetric instabilities were observed
(Ott et al. 2005; Scheidegger et al. 2008b, 2010; Kuroda
et al. 2014; Takiwaki & Kotake 2018). We note that the
GW amplitudes are bigger than those from a 75 M model

in Ott et al. (2011) with the same initial angular momentum, where the growth of the low-T/|W | instability was not
fully captured by enforcing the octant symmetry in their
simulation.
Now we move on to investigate the emission mechanism
of the quasi-periodic GW signal seen after tpb ∼ 60 ms in our
model. In the top panels of Fig. 2, we show the snapshots
of the normalized density deviation from the angle averaged
value, (ρ − hρi)/hρi, where hi represents an angular average
at a certain radius on the equatorial plane, at tpb = 70 ms
(left) and 140 ms (right). During the first phase of the quasiperiodic GW emission (60 . tpb . 80 ms), this one-armed
flow is actually kept visible, whereas the two-armed spiral
arms develop in the second active phase (tpb & 120 ms) as
seen in the top panels of Fig. 2. In both of the phases, T/|W |
reaches ∼ 5 %. Indeed, this value is close to the onset condition of the low-T/|W | instability as previously identified
in the literature (Ott et al. 2005; Scheidegger et al. 2010;
Takiwaki et al. 2016).
In order to clarify how the growth of the one- and twoarmed spiral flows lead to the quasi-periodic GW emission,
we perform an azimuthal Fourier decomposition of the density on the equatorial plane (at a radius of $ ≡ (x 2 + y 2 )1/2 =
∫ 2π
∫ 2π
100 km) as Cm (t) = 0 ρ eimφ dφ/ 0 ρ dφ, and obtain the
spectrograms of C̃m (t, f ) (using the real part). In the bottom panels of Fig. 2, we show C̃m (t, f ) for m = 1 (left panel)
and m = 2 mode (right panel), respectively. In the first active phase (60 . tpb .80 ms), one can see that both the
m = 1 and 2 modes grow, but the m = 1 mode amplitude
is bigger than the m = 2 mode. In the second active phase
(tpb & 110 ms), the dominant mode is m = 2 as clearly seen
from the bottom right panel of Fig. 2. Note that likewise
the GW spectrogram (bottom right panel of Fig. 1), the
peak frequency of C̃2 (t, f ) (bottom right panel of Fig. 2) also
increases with time.
One can determine the eigenfrequency of the spiral-wave
pattern (namely, the m-th mode of fmode,m ) from the peak
frequency of C̃m (t, f ). Note that the frequency with respect
to the pattern speed of the m−th mode is determined by

in the equatorial plane tpb = 70 ms (top left) and tpb = 140 ms (top
right) and spectrograms of m = 1 (bottom left) and m = 2 (bottom
right) mode amplitudes for the p
density. The average is taken over
a circular ring of radius $ = x 2 + y 2 in the equatorial plane.
The mode amplitude of Cm is computed through the azimuthal
Fourier decomposition of the density at $ = 100 km and z = 0
km and its spectrogram C̃m (t, f ) is shown in the bottom panels
for m = 1, 2.

fpat,m = fmode,m /m (Watts et al. 2005). So fmode,1 and fpat,1
are identical for m = 1. In the first active phase (60 . tpb .80
ms), the m = 1 eigenfrequency is fmode,1 = fpat,1 ∼ 200 Hz
(bottom left panel of Fig. 2). Similarly, in the second active
phase, the m = 2 eigenfrequency at fmode,2 ∼ 400 Hz (bottom
right panel of Fig. 2) is, for instance, translated into fpat,2 ∼
200 Hz.
In both the first and second active phases, it is a natural

consequence that the m = 2 mode frequency of fmode,2 (=
2 fpat,2 ) (i.e., bar-mode deformation of the spiral flows) leads
to the dominant quadrupole GW emission with the same
frequency. In fact, one can see a nice match of the ramp-up
frequency feature between the bar-mode amplitude (C̃2 (t, f ))
of the spiral flows (bottom right panel of Fig. 2) and the GW
spectrogram (seen as a red band from ∼ 400 to 800 Hz in
the bottom right panel of Fig. 1).
Fig. 3 shows contribution of different spherical shells
to the GW spectrogram (seen from the pole). One can see
that the ramp-up signature is generated almost all in the
layers between 10 . r . 100 km, whereas the dominant
contribution from each shell differs with time. Note that
there is also a contribution from behind the shock (100 <
r < 200 km). Our results clearly show that both the nonaxisymmetric flows that develop in the vicinity of the PNS
core surface (r ∼ 10 km) and the spiral arms extending above
coordinately give rise to the ramp-up GW emission.
Watts et al. (2005) firstly suggested that a necessary
condition for the low-T/|W | instability is the existence of

the corotation radius where the angular velocity is equal to
the pattern speed of an unstable mode (Saijo & Yoshida
2006). Following this idea, we attempt to interpret how the
ramp-up feature seen in the second active phase (tpb & 110
ms) is produced. In order to clarify how the development of
the m = 2 unstable mode is related to the corotation radius,
we show in Fig. 4 the time evolution of spatial profile of
normalized amplitude of the density perturbation with m = 2
mode |C2 (t, $)| and the corotation radius ($cor ). Note that
there is a finite-width range (∼ 10% level) in estimating the
pattern speed (corresponding to the vertical width of the
green stripe in the bottom right panel of Fig. 2). Given this,
the location of the corotation radius is also defined with a
10 % error bar as (1.0 ± 0.1) $cor , which is shown by the
red hatched regions in Fig. 4. As one can see from Fig. 4
and Fig. 3, the region above the corotation radius (20 km
. r . 100 km) contributes to the GW spectrogram more
largely than the corotation radius (10 km . r . 20 km) does.
One of the reasons is that the highly deformed region (the
reddish region in Fig. 4), leading to stronger GW emission,
locates above the corotation radius. Seen from the hatched
region of Fig.4, the corotation radius gradually shrinks from
∼ 22 km (tpb ∼ 110 ms) to ∼ 16 km at the final simulation
time. This closely coincides with the PNS core contraction.
As being dragged by the shrink of the corotation region,
the inner edge of the highly deformed region with m = 2
mode also moves inward. This also supports the idea that
the m = 2 PNS distortion may be generated via resonance at
the corotation radius, leading to the formation of the twoarmed spiral waves. The gradual recession of the corotation
point leads to the spinning up the two-armed spiral waves
(bottom right panel of Fig. 2), which is reconciled with the
ramp-up GW feature as seen in the bottom right panel of
Fig. 1.
In the end, we discuss detectability and observational

rate of the GW signals. Fig. 5 shows the GW spectral amplitudes seen from the polar (red lines) and the equatorial
(blue lines) observer at a distance of 10 kpc (solid lines) and
1 Mpc (dotted lines) relative to the sensitivity curves of the
advanced LIGO, advanced VIRGO, and KAGRA (Abbott
et al. 2018); and the third-generation GW detectors of Einstein Telescope (Hild et al. 2011) and Cosmic Explorer (Abbott et al. 2017). The peak GW spectral amplitudes of our
model are much larger than the non-rotating one of Kuroda
et al. (2018, thin gray line). In accordance with the spectrogram analysis of Fig. 1 and 2, the peaks of the GW spectra
are located around 400 . f . 900 Hz, with the GW emission stronger toward the rotational axis (red line). These
GW signals can be a target of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA
for a Galactic event. But more interestingly, these signals,
the peak frequency of which is close to the best sensitivity
range (. 1kHz) of ET and CE, could be detectable out to
Mpc distance scale by the third-generation detectors.
To roughly estimate the observational rate of this kind
of events, we make a bold assumption that a rapidly rotating massive star considered in this work would be associated with long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs). About 1%
of massive stars would rotate at sufficient speeds for lGRB
(Woosley & Heger 2006; de Mink et al. 2013). Among these
stars, a fraction of . 15% would finally form BHs based on
the assumption that all ultra metal-poor stars become BHs
(O’Connor & Ott 2011). The CC rate in the Local Group
(several Mpc) is estimated as 0.2 - 0.8 events yr−1 (Nakamura et al. 2016). Therefore the rate for CC events like our
model in the Local group would be estimated to be ∼ 0.0012
yr−1 . Admitting that this event rate is an order of magnitude
lower than the Galactic supernova event rate (0.019±0.011
yr−1 from Diehl et al. 2006), our results demonstrate that
detection of the strongest GW signals (so far predicted in the
context of full GR neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations) could provide a unique opportunity to probe into
rapid rotation and the associated non-axisymmetric instabilities, otherwise obscured deep inside the massive stellar
core.

DISCUSSIONS

Finally we shall discuss several limitations in this work. First
our simulation does not take into account magnetic fields.
If magnetorotational instability (MRI) (e.g., Akiyama et al.
2003; Obergaulinger et al. 2009; Masada et al. 2012; Rembiasz et al. 2016a,b) develops in a sufficiently short timescale,
MRI could transfer angular momentum of the PNS outward
(e.g., Mösta et al. 2015; Masada et al. 2015) and may prevent the growth of the non-axisymmetric instabilities. We
have to tackle with this by developing full 3D GR-MHD
code with spectral neutrino transport, however, this is beyond the scope of this work. Second, Saijo (2018) recently
pointed out (in the context of the isolated NSs) that the use
of different EOSs significantly impact the growth of the lowT/|W | instability (e.g., Scheidegger et al. (2010)). Not only
the impact of EOS but also of updating the neutrino opacities (e.g., Bollig et al. 2017) both of which could significantly
affect the explodability and the PNS contraction remain to
be investigated. Our full GR simulations can follow evolution in the vicinity of rapidly rotating PNSs more properly

than simplified GR treatments like effective GR potentials
(e.g. Marek et al. 2006), which is often constructed on the
basis of a spherically symmetric space. We thus believe that
our full GR treatment exerts its potential to derive quantitatively, or perhaps even qualitatively, correct GWs as they
can be sensitive to the connection between the PNS core
contraction and the low T/|W | instability. Finally a major
limitation is that we have shown results of only one simulation sample. Systematic study changing the progenitor
mass, metallicity, rotation and magnetic fields is mandatory
in order to draw a robust conclusion to clarify under which
condition the strong GW emission found in this work can
be obtained. In the decade to come, we speculate that these
issues are going to be tackled by utilizing next-generation
(Exa-scale) supercomputing resources.
