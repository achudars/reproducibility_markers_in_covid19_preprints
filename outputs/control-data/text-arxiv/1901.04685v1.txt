Abstract. In this article, we study short exact sequences of finitary 2representations of a weakly fiat 2-category. We provide a correspondence between
such short exact sequences with fixed middle term and coidempotent subcoalgebras of a coalgebra 1-morphism defining this middle term. We additionally relate
these to recollements of the underlying abelian 2-representations.

Introduction
The subject of 2-representation theory originated from [CR, KL, Ro] and is the higher
categorical analogue of the classical representation theory of algebras. The articles
[MM1]–[MM6] develop the 2-categorical analogue of finite-dimensional algebras and
their finite-dimensional modules, by defining and studying finitary 2-categories and
their finitary 2-representations. One of the fundamental questions in representation
theory is to find the simple representations of a given algebra. The question of how to
define the 2-categorical analogue of these was answered in [MM5] where the notion of
simple transitive 2-representations was defined and a Jordan-Hölder theory for finitary
2-categories is provided. Since then, there has been considerable effort to classify simple
transitive 2-representations for certain classes of finitary 2-categories.
Most of the 2-categories appearing in the categorification of Lie theoretic objects are
examples of the so-called weakly fiat 2-categories. An important defining property
of weakly fiat 2-categories is that, roughly speaking, all 1-morphisms have adjoints
(often called duals for monoidal categories, which, after strictification, can be viewed
as 2-categories with a single object). The article [MMMT] shows that every finitary 2representation over a weakly fiat 2-category can be realised as the category of injective
right comodules over a coalgebra 1-morphism. This gives a new approach to studying
finitary 2-representations. It is shown in [MMMZ] that a coalgebra 1-morphism is
cosimple if and only if the corresponding 2-representation is simple transitive. In other
words, classifying simple transitive 2-representations is equivalent to classifying cosimple
coalgebra 1-morphisms (up to Morita–Takeuchi equivalences).
This article takes a slightly different direction. After all, another important aspect
of the theory of modules over algebras is homological algebra, i.e. how to build all
representations from simple ones. The 2-analogue for homological theory associated to
finitary 2-categories has so far only been studied in [CM], where an analogue of Extgroups are introduced and studied. In this article, instead, we look back at the definition
of short exact sequence of (finitary) 2-representations used in [CM] (originally from
[SVV]), and relate them to comodules categories over coalgebra 1-morphisms. The
questions we ask are the following.
• How do we realise a finitary sub-2-representation in the language of comodule
theory over coalgebra 1-morphisms?
• When can we fit the quotient morphism of 2-representations induced by a
subcoalgebra into a short exact sequence of 2-representation?

• What is the relation between the coalgebra 1-morphisms generating the
three finitary 2-representations appearing in a short exact sequence of 2representations?
It turns out that the answer is closely related to coidempotent subcoalgebras (see
Definition 10) and recollements of abelian categories. More precisely, our main theorem
(Theorem 20) states that
• given a coidempotent subcoalgebra D of a coalgebra 1-morphism C, we can
construct a coalgebra 1-morphism A from a certain injective C-comodule I
such that there is a short exact sequence

→ injC (C) −−−C−→ injC (D) −→ 0

of 2-representations, where −Y X denotes the cotensor product functor;
• given a short exact sequence of 2-representations
0 −→ N −→ M −→ K −→ 0
and choosing a coalgebra 1-morphism C with M ∼
= injC (C), there exists a
subcoalgebra D of C, unique up to isomorphism and necessarily coidempotent,
such that injC (D) is equivalent to the quotient 2-representation K.
Moreover, passing to the abelianised 2-representations, in the above situation, we have
a recollement of abelian categories

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 1, we provide a summary of the setup
and results from previous articles on the subject which we need for our purposes. In
Section 2, we discuss some preliminary results about recollements and functors between
comodules categories. We also provide a correspondence between subcoalgebras of
a given coalgebra and subcategories of its comodule categories that are closed under
subobjects, quotients and closed under the action by the 2-category, generalising results
in [NT]. In Section 3, we define coidempotent subcoalgebras, show that they correspond
to Serre subcategories of the category of comodules, and discuss their relationship with
recollements. This then leads to the statement and the proof of the main theorem in
the final subsection. Finally, we provide some examples in Section 4.

Let k be an algebraically closed field.
1.1. 2-categories and 2-representations. We start by recalling some terminology on
finitary categories and 2-categories. We refer to reader to [Le, McL] for more detail on
general 2-categories and to [MM1, MM2, MM3, MM4, MM5, MM6] for more detail on
2-representations of finitary 2-categories.
A k-linear category is called finitary if it is idempotent complete, has only finitely
many isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects and all morphism spaces are finite

dimensional. The collection of finitary k-linear categories, together with additive klinear functors and all natural transformations between such functors, forms a 2-category
denoted by Afk .
In [MM1], a finitary 2-category C was defined to be a 2-category such that
• C has finitely many objects;
• each morphism category C (i, j) is in Afk ;
• horizontal composition is biadditive and bilinear;
• for each i ∈ C, the identity 1-morphism 1i is indecomposable.
We denote by ◦0 and ◦1 the horizontal and vertical compositions in C, respectively.
A finitary 2-category C is called weakly fiat if it has a weak anti-equivalence (−)∗
reversing the direction of both 1- and 2-morphisms, such that, for a 1-morphism F,
the pair (F, F∗ ) is an adjoint pair, see [MM1, Subsection 2.4]. It is called fiat if (−)∗
is weakly involutive. We denote the weak inverse of (−)∗ by ∗ (−), obtaining another
adjoint pair (∗ F, F).
A finitary 2-representation of C is a 2-functor from C to Afk . An important example
of a finitary 2-representation is, for each i ∈ C , the principal 2-representation Pi :=
C (i, − ).
We can (injectively)
Q abelianise both the 2-category C and, for a 2-representation M, the
category M := i∈C M(i) and use the notation (−) for the injective abelianisation
(2)-functor. For the 2-category, this needs to be done in a rather technical way, see
[MMMT, Section 3.2] to preserve strictness of horizontal composition. Note that,
provided that C is weakly fiat, composition in C is left exact in both variables. Indeed,
left and right multiplication by 1-morphisms in C is exact thanks to the existence
of adjoints, and all 1-morphisms of C can be regarded as kernels of 2-morphisms in
C , whence application of the snake lemma yields the claim, cf. [MMMZ, Subsection
3.1].
For M, it is equivalently possible to use the classical diagrammatic abelianisation, see
[Fr], or [MMMT, Section 3.1] for a presentation adapted to our notation. This induces
an abelian 2-representation M on M.
Both finitary and abelian 2-representations of C form 2-categories, denoted C -afmod
and C -mod, respectively, in which 1-morphisms are strong 2-natural transformations,
which we also simply call morphisms of 2-represenations, and 2-morphisms are modifications, see [MM3, Section 2] for details.
In slight abuse of notation, we will, for any 2-representation M, write F X rather than
M(F)(X).
A 2-representation M ∈ C-afmod is said to be transitive, cf. [MM5, Subsection
3.1], if, for any indecomposable objects X, Y ∈ M, there exists a 1-morphism F in C
such that Y is isomorphic to a direct summand of F X. We say that a transitive 2representation M is simple transitive, cf. [MM5, Subsection 3.5], if M has no proper
C -invariant ideals. In [MM5, Section 4], it was proved that every M ∈ C -afmod has a
weak Jordan-Hölder series with transitive subquotients, and the list of their respective
simple transitive quotients is unique up to permutation and equivalence.

1.2. Coalgebra 1-morphisms and their `comodule categories. A coalgebra 1morphism in `
C is a coalgebra object in i∈C C (i, i), i.e. a direct sum C of 1morphisms in i∈C C (i, i)equipped with 2-morphisms µC : C → CC and εC : C →

i∈C 1i , called comultiplication and counit respectively, satisfying coassociativity (µC ◦0 idC ) ◦1 µC = (idC ◦0 µC ) ◦1 µC and counitality (idC ◦0 εC ) ◦1 µC = idC =
(εC ◦0 idC ) ◦1 µC .

A right (resp. left) comodule over C is a 1-morphism M in C together with a coaction
ρM : M → MC (resp. λC : M → CM) such that (idM ◦0 µC ) ◦1 ρM = (ρM ◦0 idC ) ◦1 ρM
and (idM ◦0 εC ) ◦1 ρM = idM (resp. (µC ◦0 idM ) ◦1 ρM = (idC ◦0 λM ) ◦1 ρM and
(εC ◦0 idM ) ◦1 ρ = idM ). Note that the last condition implies that all coaction maps
are monomorphisms in C .
The cotensor product over C of a right C-comodule M with a left C-comodule N is
the kernel of the map
ρM ◦0 idN −idM ◦0 λN

MN −−−−−−−−−−−−→ MCN.
1.3. Internal homs and 2-representations. Let C be a weakly fiat 2-category. This
subsection is essentially a summary of [MMMT, Sections 4]. Note that results there
were stated for a fiat 2-category, but none of the proofs use involutivity of (−)∗ , hence
all proofs go through verbatim for the weakly fiat case.
Let M be a finitary 2-representation of C and N ∈ M. Recall the internal hom functor
[N, −] : M → C , which is defined as the left adjoint to the evaluation of the action on
N , i.e.
HomM (−, FN ) ∼
= HomC ([N, −], F)
for all F ∈ C . The internal hom [N, N ] has the structure of a coalgebra 1-morphism and
for any M ∈ M, [N, M ] has the structure of a right [N, N ]-comodule in C. The category consisting of such right [N, N ]-comodule in C carries the structure of an abelian
2-representation of C, denoted by comodC [N, N ], and the finitary 2-representation on
the subcategory of injective right [N, N ]-comodules is denoted by injC [N, N ]. The latter is equivalent to the additive closure in comodC [N, N ] of {F[N, N ] | F ∈ C}. Note
that, as shown in [MMMT, Proof of Lemma 6], F[X, Y ] ∼
= [X, FY ] for all X, Y ∈ M
and all F ∈ C; the same holds also for X, Y ∈ M by the same proof. Note also that
comodC [N, N ] is equivalent to injC [N, N ].
In [MMMT, Section 4], it was shown that when M is transitive, then the realisation morphism [N, −] defines an equivalence of abelian 2-representations between M
and comodC [N, N ], and also restricts to an equivalence of finitary 2-representations
between M and injC [N, N ]. In fact, the same proof works for any GM (N ), i.e.
for arbitrary N ∈ M, the realisation morphism induces an equivalence of finitary 2representations between GM (N ) and injC [N, N ]. In particular, one can always realise
a finitary 2-representation as injC [N, N ] by taking N as the direct sum of all indecomposable objects (up to isomorphisms). As such, from now on, we do not distinguish
between comodules (resp. injective comodules) over a coalgebra 1-morphism and objects of an abstract abelian (respectively, finitary) 2-representation.

2. Preliminary results
In this section, we collect some preliminary results leading towards our main theorem.
2.1. Recollements of abelian categories. Recall that a diagram

of abelian categories is a recollement provided that
• (q, i, p) and (l, e, r) are adjoint triples;
• the functors l, r and i are fully faithful;
• the image of i is a Serre subcategory, which is the kernel of e.
Lemma 1. Let

between the full subcategories of injective objects.
Proof. The sequence restricts since both r and p are right adjoints to exact functors
and hence preserve injectives.
By the definition of recollement, r is fully faithful. Since pi is naturally isomorphic to
the identity functor on A (see e.g.[PV, Proposition 2.7(ii)]), p is necessarily full and
dense.
It remains to show that the kernel of p coincides with the ideal I in Inj B generated
by (the full subcategory given by) the essential image of r restricted to Inj C. It is
well-known that pr = 0 (see e.g.[PV, Proposition 2.7(ii)]), so it immediately follows
that, considering the restricted sequence (2), I is contained in the kernel of p. For
simplicity, we say that an object is in I if its identity morphism is in I.
Assume that Q1 , Q2 ∈ Inj B are both not annihilated by p, and hence are not objects
in I. We claim that if f : Q1 → Q2 is annihilated by p, it factors over some I ∈ I.
Indeed, as ip(M ) is the maximal subobject of M with composition factors belonging to
i(A) for any M ∈ B, ip is a subfunctor of IdB . Thus, we have a commutative diagram

meaning that f factors over Q1 /ip(Q1 ) as indicated by the dashed arrow f¯.
Considering the exact sequence
0 → ip(Q1 ) → Q1 → re(Q1 )
(cf. [FP, Proposition 4.2], [Ps, Proposition 2.6(ii)]) and letting I ′ be the injective hull
of e(Q1 ) ∈ C, we obtain a monomorphism Q1 /ip(Q1 ) ֒→ r(I ′ ), and hence the injective
hull I of Q1 /ip(Q1 ), which is a direct summand of r(I ′ ), is in I. By injectivity of Q2 ,
f¯ now factors over I, so f factors over I ∈ I, as claimed.

2.2. Functors between comodule categories. From now on, C will denote a weakly
fiat 2-category.
Lemma 2. Let C, C′ be coalgebra 1-morphisms in C and Y a C, C′ -bicomodule.
(i) For any M ∈ comodC (C′ ), the internal hom [Y, M ] is a right C-comodule in C .
(ii) [Y, −] : comodC (C′ ) → comodC (C) is left adjoint to −C Y .
Proof. Both statements are proved in exactly the same way as in the classical case of
coalgebras over a field, see [BW, 12.6, 12.7].

Lemma 3. Let C, C′ be coalgebra 1-morphisms in C and Y a C, C′ -bicomodule. The
following statements are equivalent:
(a) Y ∈ injC (C′ ).
(b) [Y, −] is exact.
If either condition is satisfied, we have [Y, −] ∼
= −C′ [Y, C′ ] as functors from
comodC (C′ ) to comodC (C)
Proof. The same proof as in [BW, 12.8, 23.7] shows that [Y, −] : comodC (C′ ) →
comodC (C) is exact if and only if IC Y is injective for all injective C-comodules I. In
our setting, since every injective I is direct summand in comodC (C) of FC for some
1-morphism F, this is equivalent to CC Y ∈ injC (C′ ), but CC Y ∼
= Y. The last
statement is proved in the same way as in loc. cit.

Since [C, C] ∼
= C by the definition of realisation morphism, an immediate consequence
of Lemma 3 is the following result.
Corollary 4. For a coalgebra 1-morphism C in C , we have an isomorphism between
[C, −] and the identity functor on comodC (C).
Lemma 5. Let C be a coalgebra 1-morphism in C, I ∈ injC (C). Then
IC [M, C] ∼
= [M, I]
for all M ∈ comodC (C).

Proof. Any I ∈ injC (C) is a direct summand in comodC (C) of FC for some 1-morphism
F ∈ C. Since all functors are additive, the claim follows from
FCC [M, C] ∼
= [M, FC].

2.3. The comodule category of a subcoalgebra and related functors. Let C =
(C, µC , ǫC ) be a coalgebra 1-morphism. By a subcoalgebra D of C, we mean a
coalgebra 1-morphism D = (D, µD , ǫD ) together with a monomorphism ι : D ֒→ C in
C satisfying µD ◦1 ι = (ι ◦0 ι) ◦1 µD and ǫD = ǫC ◦1 ι.
Note that for any right D-comodule N with coaction map ρD
N : N → ND, one naturally
obtains a right C-comodule by post-composing ρD
N with idN ◦0 ι. This construction
give rise to a functor −D DC (see the lemma below and [MMMZ, Section 3.4]). In
particular, a right C-comodule is in the essential image of −D DC if its coaction map
ρC
M : M → MC factors through idM ◦0 ι. This fact will be used throughout the rest of
the article.

Lemma 6. Let C be a coalgebra 1-morphism in C and D ֒→ C be a subcoalgebra
π
with cokernel C ։ J. The natural morphism of 2-representations comodC (D) →
comodC (C) given by −D DC is fully faithful, exact, and the subcategory it defines is
closed under quotients and subobjects.
Proof. The fact that −D DC is faithful is obvious from the definition. By injectivity
of D D, it follows from Lemma 3 that [D, −] : comodC (D) → comodC (C) is exact and
[D, −] ∼
= −D DC , hence −D DC is exact.
= −D [D, D]C ∼
To see that it is full consider a morphism f : M → N between two objects isomorphic
to M′ D DC and N′ D DC respectively, i.e. both coaction ρM and ρN factor over
D

M : M → MD and ρN : N → ND respectively. Consider the diagram

Since (idM ◦0 π) ◦1 ρM = (idM ◦0 π) ◦1 (idM ◦0 ι) ◦1 ρD
M = (idM ◦0 (π ◦1 ι)) ◦1 ρM = 0,
we have (idN ◦0 π) ◦1 ρN ◦1 f = (f ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 (idM ◦0 π) ◦1 ρM = 0 and, since f is
epi, (idN ◦0 π) ◦1 ρN = 0. Hence ρN factors over the kernel of idN ◦0 π, which, by left
exactness of horizontal composition with idN is idN ◦0 ι. This yields the dashed arrow
σ. Now we have

(idN ◦0 ι) ◦1 σ ◦1 f = ρN ◦1 f = (f ◦0 idC ) ◦1 ρM
= (f ◦0 idC ) ◦1 (idM ◦0 ι) ◦1 ρD
M
= (idN ◦0 ι) ◦1 (f ◦0 idD ) ◦1 ρD
M.
As (idN ◦0 ι) is mono, it follows that σ ◦1 f = (f ◦0 idD ) ◦1 ρD
M , so the coaction on N
indeed factors over ND as claimed.
To show closure under subobjects, let f : N ֒→ M be a monomorphism. Consider the

As before, (idM ◦0 π)◦1 ρM = 0, so (idM ◦0 π)◦1 ρM ◦1 f = (f ◦0 idJ )◦1 (idN ◦0 π)◦1 ρN = 0
and since f ◦0 idJ is a monomorphism (using left exactness of horizontal composition
with idJ ), furthermore, (idN ◦0 π) ◦1 ρN = 0. Hence, as above, ρN factors over ND,
giving the dashed arrow σ. Similarly to before,
(idM ◦0 ι) ◦1 (f ◦0 idD ) ◦1 σ = (f ◦0 idC ) ◦1 (idN ◦0 ι) ◦1 σ
= (f ◦0 idC ) ◦1 ρN = ρM ◦1 f
= (idM ◦0 ι) ◦1 ρD
M ◦1 f
and thanks to monicity of idM ◦0 ι, we conclude (f ◦0 idD ) ◦1 σ = ρD
M ◦1 f .
It is immediate that in both cases that σ defines a right coaction on N. Indeed, in
general, if a right C-coaction ρN : N → NC factors over the inclusion idN ◦0 ι : ND →

= (idN ◦0 ι ◦0 ι) ◦1 (idN ◦0 µD ) ◦1 σ
where the first equality uses the interchange law twice, the second and fourth equalities
are the definition of σ , the third equality comes from ρN being a coaction, and the
last equality from ι being a coalgebra map. Cancelling the monomorphism idN ◦0 ι ◦0 ι
implies the first comodule axiom. For the second, we compute
(idN ◦0 εD ) ◦1 σ = (idN ◦0 εC ) ◦1 (idN ◦0 ι) ◦1 σ(idN ◦0 εC ) ◦1 ρN = idN .

Lemma 7. Let C be a coalgebra 1-morphism in in C , and D ֒→ C a subcoalgebra.
(i) −D DC D is naturally isomorphic to the identity morphism on comodC (D).
(ii) There is a monic natural transformation from −C DD DC to the identity morphism on comodC (C).
Proof. Denote by Ψ the morphism (−D DC ) : comodC (D) → comodC (C) and by Φ
the morphism −C D : comodC (C) → comodC (D). Note that Ψ ∼
= [D, −] as argued
in the proof of Lemma 6, and (Ψ ∼
= [D, −], Φ = −C D) is an adjoint pair by Lemma
2. Now (i) and (ii) are exactly the same as [MMMZ, Corollary 7] and [MMMZ, Lemma
8] respectively.

Lemma 8. Suppose S is a full subcategory of comodC (C) that is C -stable, subobjectclosed, and quotient-closed. Let i be the (fully faithful exact) embedding of S into
comodC (C) and p be its right adjoint. Then D := [ip(C), ip(C)] is a subcoalgebra
of C so that −D DC : comodC (D) → comodC (C) induces an equivalence between
comodC (D) and S.
Proof. Consider the right C-comodule B given by the sum of all images of right Ccomodule morphisms of the form f : M → C with M ∈ S. Since S is quotient-closed,
we have B ∈ S. In particular, B coincides with ip(C) (which is the sum of all subobjects
of C in S), and the counit of the adjoint pair (i, p) therefore defines a monomorphism
ι′ : B → C.

from an object of S to C factors through ι′ , so the morphism in the above exact
sequence is surjective and hence an isomorphism. Using the adjoint pairs ([B, −], − · B)

Showing that D ֒→ C is a subcoalgebra is equivalent to showing that [B, B] ֒→ [C, C]
is a subcoalgebra, where θ := [C, ι′ ] ◦ α. For simplicity, let us denote by µC , ǫC the
comultiplication and counit of [C, C] throughout the rest of the proof.
We first verify the compatibility of the counit maps of D and C, i.e. ǫD = ǫC ◦ θ. Using
the definition θ = [C, ι′ ] ◦ α and that α is the inverse of ([ι′ , B])−1 , this is equivalent
to showing that ǫC ◦1 [C, ι′ ] = ǫD ◦1 [ι′ , B]. Recall that, for any X ∈ comodC (C), the
counit of [X, X] is the map in C corresponding to idX under the adjunction isomorphism

where the second is obtained from combining the natural transformation [ι′ , −] :

To show compatibility of the comultiplications, let us start by recalling some essential
facts. For any X, Y ∈ comodC (C), the coevaluation map coevX,Y : Y → [X, Y]X
is the map corresponding to id[X,Y] under the adjunction HomC ([X, Y], [X, Y]) ∼
=
HomcomodC (C) (Y, [X, Y]X). The comultiplication of the coalgebra [X, X] is given by
the map in C corresponding to (id[X,X] ◦0 coevX,X ) ◦1 coevX,X .

Indeed, commutativity of the top left square is trivial; that of the bottom right square is
easy, since both maps are just [C, ι′ ]◦0 coevC,C . It is also easy to see that commutativity
of the top (resp. middle) right square follows immediately from that of the middle (resp.
bottom) left square as the former are obtained from the latter by horizontally composing
with identity maps.
To see that the middle left square commutes (i.e. coevC,B = (α ◦0 ι′ ) ◦1 coevB,B ), we
use the commutative diagrams

θ = [C, ι′ ] ◦1 ([ι′ , B])−1 , we obtain that µC ◦1 θ = (θ ◦0 θ) ◦1 µD . This completes the
proof of the compatibility between comultiplications of D and [C, C] ∼
= C under θ.
It remains to show the equivalence −D DC : comodC (D) → S. For a D-comodule
M, we have an exact sequence 0 → M → FD in comodC (D) for some F ∈ C. Recall
that ip(C) = B ∼
= [C, B] ∼
= [B, B], so we have isomorphisms of right C-comodules
∼
∼
ip(C) = DC = CC DD DC . In particular, we have DC ∈ S. Since S is C -stable,
we have (FD)D DC ∼
= FDC ∈ S, so it follows from the assumption of S being closed
under subobjects that MD DC ∈ S. Hence, −D DC induces a well-defined functor
from comodC (D) to S.
Recall from Lemma 6 that −D DC is fully faithful. It remains to show that it is dense.
Indeed, if M ∈ S, then we have an exact sequence 0 → M → FC in comodC (C) for
some F ∈ C , which induces an exact sequence 0 → ip(M) → ip(FC). By assumption,

COIDEMPOTENT SUBCOALGEBRAS AND SHORT EXACT SEQUENCES OF 2-REPRESENTATIONS 13

we have ip(M) = M. Since by assumption i(FM) ∼
= Fi(M) for all M ∈ S, we also have
p(FN) ∼
= Fp(N) for all N ∈ comodC (C), as can be seen from the chain of isomorphisms
HomS (M, p(FN)) ∼
= HomcomodC (C) (i(M), FN)

∼
= HomcomodC (C) (i(∗ FM), N)
∼
= HomS (∗ FM, p(N))
∼
= HomS (M, Fp(N)),
which holds for any M ∈ S. We thus have ip(FC) ∼
= F(ip(C)) ∼
= FD, which is in
the essential image of −D DC . Thus, as comodC (D) is closed under subobjects by
Lemma 6 and −D DC is exact, M is also in the essential image of −D DC .

This leads us to the following proposition, which generalises [NT, Theorem 4.2(iii)].
Proposition 9. The construction in Lemma 8 induces a bijection between the set
of C-stable subobject-closed quotient-closed full subcategories of comodC (C) up to
equivalence and the set of subcoalgebras of C up to isomorphism.
Proof. Let Ω be the set of C -stable subobject-closed quotient-closed full subcategories
of comodC (C) up to equivalence, and Φ be the set of subcoalgebras of C up isomorphism. By Lemma 8, assigning S 7→ [ip(C), ip(C)], where i is the inclusion of S into
comodC (C) and p is the right adjoint of i, defines a map f : Ω → Φ.
On the other hand, for a subcoalgebra D, it follows from Lemma 6 that comodC (D) is
equivalent to a subobject-closed quotient-closed full subcategory of comodC (C). Note
that this subcategory is also C -stable as D is a coalgebra 1-morphism in C . Clearly,
isomorphic subcoalgebras define the same full subcategory up to equivalence. Hence,
we have a map g : Φ → Ω.
Starting with S ∈ Ω, we have gf (S) = comodC (f (S)), which is equivalent to S by
Lemma 8; this means that gf = idΩ . For D ∈ Φ, Lemma 7 says that the inclusion of
comodC (D) into comodC (C) and its right adjoint are given by −D DC and −C D
respectively. Since CC DD DC ∼
= DC , the subcoalgebra f g(D) is given [DC , DC ].
By the same argument as in the first two paragraphs in the proof of Lemma 8, we
have [DC , DC ] ∼
= [C, D] ∼
= D. Therefore, we have f g(D) ∼
= D, i.e. f g = idΦ as
required.

3. Coidempotent subalgebras and extensions
3.1. Coidempotent subcoalgebras. Following [NT], we define the following notion,
which, in the classical setting, is dual to idempotent quotient algebras A/AeA.
Definition 10. Let C be a coalgebra 1-morphism in C and D a subcoalgebra of C. We
say that D an coidempotent subcoalgebra of C if µ−1
C (CD+DC) = D or, equivalently,
for J = C/D, the map µJ := (idJ ◦0 πJ ) ◦1 ρJ : J → JJ is a monomorphism in C, where
πJ : C → J is the natural projection and ρJ is the right C-coaction map of J.
Lemma 11. Let C be a coalgebra 1-morphism in C and D a subcoalgebra. Set J = C/D
and let I be the injective hull of J in comodC (C).
(i) D is coidempotent if and only if JC D = 0.
(ii) For Q ∈ injC (C), if QC D = 0, then Q ∈ addinjC (C) {FI | F ∈ C }. Moreover,
the converse holds when D is coidempotent.

where λJ is the left C-coaction map of J. Using the interchange law and the induced

so that the right-hand square commutes. This implies that JC D ∼
= ker µJ . The claim
follows.
(ii) Realise Q ∈ injC (C) as a direct summand (inside injC (C)) of GC, for some 1morphism G ∈ C, with complement Q′ . Let −D DC : comodC (D) ֒→ comodC (C)
be the morphism from Lemma 6 given by extending the coaction from D to C.
Consider the exact sequence
0 → GD → Q ⊕ Q′ → GJ
in comodC (C). We claim that if the induced morphism α : GD → Q is nonzero, then
QC D 6= 0. Indeed, as GD is in the essential image of −D DC , the nonzero image Z
of α, as a quotient of GD, is also in the essential image of −D DC by Lemma 6, and
isomorphic to Z′ D DC for some Z′ ∈ comodC (D). On the one hand, applying −C D
to the monomorphism Z ֒→ Q yields a monomorphism ZC D ֒→ QC D. On the other
hand, it follows from Lemma 7(i) that ZC D ∼
= Z ′ D DC D ∼
= Z ′ is nonzero. Thus
we obtain that QC D is also nonzero, as claimed.
Therefore, if QC D = 0, then Q is not in the coimage of the first map of the exact
sequence above. This implies that Q is isomorphic to a subobject of GJ, which in turn
is a subobject of GI. Injectivity of Q implies that it is in fact isomorphic to a direct
summand of GI.
Let us now assume D is coidempotent and show the converse. Let F0 be the injective
hull of J in C and ϑ : J ֒→ F0 the canonical embedding. Since the induced comultiplication on J is, by assumption, a monomorphism in C and composition in C is left exact,
we have monomorphisms J ֒→ JJ ֒→ F0 J in comodC (C). We obtain a commutative

Lemma 12. Suppose D ֒→ C is a coidempotent subcoalgebra. Let I be the injective
hull of the cokernel of ι and M be a simple C-comodule with injective hull Q. Then
the following are equivalent.
(i) MC D = 0.
(ii) QC D = 0.
(iii) Q ∈ add{FI | F ∈ C }.
Proof. (ii)⇔(iii): This is Lemma 11 (ii).
(ii)⇒(i): Clear by left exactness of −C D.
(i)⇒(ii): By Lemma 7 (ii), QC DD DC is a subcomodule of Q, which has simple
socle M in the case when it is non-zero. Since the smallest non-trivial subcomodule M
of Q is annihilated by −C D, it follows that QC DD DC = 0. But −D DC is fully
faithful, so QC D = 0.

we provide a correspondence between coidempotent subcoalgebras of a coalgebra 1morphism C and Serre subcategories of comodC (C). Throughout this subsection, we

Lemma 13. If D ֒→ C is a coidempotent subcolagebra, then the fully faithful exact
embedding −D DC sends comodC (D) to a Serre subcategory of comodC (C).
Proof. By Lemma 6, it remains to show closure under extensions.
For any M ∈ comodC (C), we denote by σM the composition (idM ◦0 πJ ) ◦1 ρM ,
where ρM is the coaction map. Then M being in the essential image of comodC (C) is

in C with exact rows.
This induces a commutative diagram where all C’s and ρ’s above are replaced by J
and σ respectively. Hence we have (g ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 σY = σZ ◦1 g = 0, which means that
the image of σY is in the kernel of g ◦0 idJ . Exactness of the top row of the diagram
implies that there is φ : Y → XJ so that (f ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 φ = σY . Thus, we have
(σY ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 σY = (σY ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 (f ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 φ
= ((σY ◦1 f ) ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 φ
= (((f ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 σX ) ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 φ

On the other hand, (Y −−→ Y C −−−−−→ Y CC) = (Y −−→ Y C −−−−−→ Y CC) and
this induces (σY ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 σY = (idY ◦0 µJ ) ◦1 σY . Combining this with the argument
in the previous paragraph, we see that (idY ◦0 µJ ) ◦1 σY = 0. Since D is coidempotent
(i.e. µJ is mono) and horizontal left composition with idY preserves monicity, we obtain
that idY ◦0 µJ is mono, which implies σY = 0 as required.

Lemma 14. Let K be the kernel of µJ . Then there is a short exact sequence
0 → D → µ−1
C (CD + DC) → K → 0
of right C-comodules, and K is also a D-comodule.

in comodC (C). This yields
(ιK ◦0 idJ ) ◦1 (idK ◦0 πJ ) ◦1 ρK = (idJ ◦0 πJ ) ◦1 ρJ ◦1 ιK = µJ ◦1 ιK = 0.
In particular, since ιK ◦0 idJ is mono (as, again, horizontal composition inherits monicity
of ιK ), we deduce that (idK ◦0 πJ ) ◦1 ρK = 0, as required to show that K is indeed a
right D-comodule.

Remark 15. All maps in the above proof are in fact morphisms of C-C-bicomodules,
so the exact sequence in the statement of the lemma can be interpreted as an exact
sequence of C-C-bicomodules. A similar proof shows that K is also a D-D bicomodule.

Proposition 16. Suppose D ֒→ C is a subcoalgebra. Then the fully faithful embedding
−D DC sends comodC (D) to a Serre subcategory of comodC (C) if, and only if, D is
coidempotent.
Proof. If D is coidempotent, we have already shown in Lemma 13 that comodC (D)
embeds as a Serre subcategory. It remains to show the converse.
Recall from Lemma 14 that we have a short exact sequence of right C-comodules
0 → D → D2 → K → 0,
with D2 = µ−1
C (CD + DC). Furthermore, D and K are both right D-comodules,
meaning their C-coaction map factors through id ◦0 ι, that is, D, K are in the essential
image of −D DC .
Since a Serre subcategory is extension-closed, we obtain that D2 is in the essential image
of −D DC . Note that CC DD DC = DC is the maximal subobject of C that belongs
to the essential image of −D DC . However, D2 is a subobject of C (the cokernel being

the image of µJ ), so we deduce that D2 ∼
= D, i.e. D is coidempotent.
3.3. Coidempotent subcoalgebras and recollements. We have now shown C -stable
Serre subcategories of comodC (C) can be associated to a coidempotent subcoalgebra
of D. It is natural to ask what the quotient comodC (C)/ comodC (D) is, or how the

Proof. (i): By the defining property of internal homs, [I, M] = 0 is equivalent to
HomcomodC (C) (M, FI) ∼
= HomC ([I, M], F) = 0 for all F ∈ C. This is the same as
saying that M is not in the socle of any of the object in add{FI | F ∈ C }.
(ii): Let A be the coalgebra 1-morphism given by [I, I]. Then [I, −] : comodC (C) →
comodC (A) is exact by Lemma 3. The full subcategory in the claim is then the kernel
of an exact functor, hence a Serre subcategory. This subcategory is clearly C -stable
as [I, −] is a morphism of 2-representations. Now it follows from Lemma 8 that this
category is equivalent to comodC (D) for some subcoalgebra D of C, and D being
coidempotent follows from Lemma 16.
(iii): Since comodC (D) embeds (via −D DC ) as a Serre subcategory of comodC (C),
MD DC is a simple C-comodule. By the defining property of this Serre subcategory,
[I, MD DC ] = 0, and the claim follows from (i).

For a subcoalgebra D of C, Lemma 2 tells us that there is an adjoint triple
([D DC , −], −D DC ∼
= [C DD , −], −C D)
between the comodule categories of these two coalgebras. It follows from Lemma 6
that −D DC is fully faithful.
On the other hand, if we pick an injective C-comodule I and let A to be the coalgebra
1-morphism given by [I, I], then we obtain another adjoint triple
∼ [I, −], −A I)
([[I, C], −], −C [I, C] =
between the comodule categories of C and A. Note that the middle isomorphisms
follow from Lemma 3. Moreover, −A I is fully faithful; one can see this by showing
[I, −]◦(−A I) is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on comodC (A). Indeed, as
[I, −] ∼
= −C [I, C], the functor is naturally isomorphic to −A IC [I, C] ∼
= −A [I, I] =
−A A ∼
= IdcomodC (A) , where the first isomorphism uses Lemma 5.
Similarly, we show that [I, [[I, C], −]] ∼
= Idcomod (A) to demonstrate that [[I, C], −] is
C

fully faithful. To this end, we compute, for all M, M′ ∈ comodC (A), that
Homcomod (A) ([I, [[I, C], M]], M′ ) ∼
= Homcomod (C) ([[I, C], M]], M′ A I)
C

ι

Proposition 18. Suppose D ֒→ C is a coidempotent subcoalgebra, and I the injective
hull in comodC (C) of the cokernel of ι. Then we have a recollement of the form (4).
Proof. We already know from Proposition 16 that the essential image of comodC (D)
under −D DC is a Serre subcategory of comodC (C). It remains to show that this
coincides with the full subcategory consisting of M ∈ comodC (C) such that [I, M] = 0.

∼ MC DD DC .
It suffices to check that [I, M] = 0 ∈ comodC (A) if and only if M =
Furthermore, it suffices to check that these conditions are equivalent for simple objects
M.
Let Q be the injective hull of M. It follows from Lemma 17(i) that [I, M] = 0 is
equivalent to Q not being in add{FI | F ∈ C }. By Lemma 12 this is then equivalent
to MC D 6= 0.
As MC DD DC is a subcomodule of M, the assumption of M being simple means
that MC D 6= 0 is equivalent to MC DD DC ∼

= M.
Proposition 19. Let C be a coalgebra 1-morphism, and I an injective C-comodule.
There exists a subcoalgebra D of C, unique up to isomorphism, which is maximal
with respect to IC D = 0, and such that injC (D) is equivalent to the quotient 2representation injC (C)/GinjC (C) (I). Furthermore, D is coidempotent.
Proof. Consider the exact sequence of 2-representations
π

0 → GinjC (C) (I) → injC (C) → K → 0.
The construction in [MMMZ, Section 3.2] produces, for any full and dense morphism
of 2-representations, an embedding of a subcoalgebra, and this embedding is strict if
and only if the full and dense morphism is not an equivalence.
Explicitly, in our situation, this construction defines the coalgebra 1-morphism D via
HomK (C, FC) ∼
= HomC (D, F)
for all 1-morphisms F in C and produces an embedding ι : D ֒→ C.
Furthermore, K is equivalent to injC (D) and the full and dense morphism of 2representations injC (C) ։ injC (D) corresponding to π is given by −C D by [MMMZ,
Proposition 11].
We assert that D is maximal among subcoalgebras B of C with IC B = 0. Firstly,
note that we indeed have IC D = 0 by exactness of
− D

0 → GinjC (C) (I) → injC (C) −−−C−→ injC (D) → 0.

(5)

Secondly, if B is another subcoalgebra of C, strictly containing D, then we obtain
a full and dense morphism of 2-representations injC (B) ։ injC (D) that is not an
equivalence. Hence the kernel of −C B would be strictly contained in the kernel of
−C D. By exactness of (5), the latter ideal (of injC (C)) is the same as the ideal
generated by GinjC (C) (I), so there must be some Q ∈ GinjC (C) (I) so that QC B 6= 0.
But QC B is a direct summand of FIC B, so we deduce that IC B 6= 0.
It remains to show that D is coidempotent. We first claim that the essential image in comodC (D) of the fully faithful functor −D DC is closed under extensions.
Indeed, assume M1 , M2 are in the full subcategory given by the essential image of
−D DC . In particular, for i = 1, 2, we have Mi ∼
= Mi C DD DC , which implies
that no composition factor of Mi is annihilated by −C D. Consider an extension
0 → M1 → M → M2 → 0 in comodC (C). Then also no composition factor of M
is annihilated by −C D, which implies that there is no map from M to any injective
Q ∈ GinjC (C) (I).
We obtain a commutative diagram with exact rows

in be a lift of q to an injective presentation. Since q is annihilated by −C D, the
map q1 C D factors over gC D. By fullness of −C D, this implies that there already
is a map h : Q2 → Q′1 such that setting q1′ = q1 − hg, we have q1′ C D = 0. Note
that replacing q1 by q1′ and q2 by q2 − g ′ h defines another lift of q to a map between
injective presentations, so without loss of generality, we may assume that we already
had q1 C D = 0 by choosing q1 appropriately. By exactness of (5), this implies that q1
factors over an object FI in GinjC (C) (I) and the first two columns of the diagram give
rise to a commutative diagram

Now the fact that there is no nonzero map from M to any object in GinjC (C) (I) implies
that j ′ q = q1 j = 0 and by monicity of j ′ , we conclude that q = 0. Therefore, the
embedding MC DD DC ֒→ M is an isomorphism, meaning that M is in the essential
image of −D DC . This finishes the proof for the claim that the essential image of
−D DC is extension-closed.
By Lemma 6, we already know that −D DC embeds comodC (D) as a full subcategory
of comodC (C) that is closed under subobjects and quotients. So the essential image
of −D DC being also closed under extensions implies that it is a Serre subcategory.
Now the statement that D is coidempotent follows from Proposition 16, whereas the
uniqueness of D follows from Proposition 9.

3.4. The main result.
Theorem 20. (i) Let C be a coalgebra 1-morphism in C and suppose D is a coidempotent subcoalgebra of C. Set J := C/D. Let I be the injective hull of J
inside comodC (C) and set A = [I, I].Then we have a short exact sequence of
2-representations

(ii) Suppose
0 −→ N −→ M −→ K −→ 0
is a short exact sequence of 2-representations. Then, choosing a coalgebra 1morphism C with M ∼
= injC (C), there exists a subcoalgebra D of C, unique

that

Proof. (i) The assumption is precisely that of Proposition 18, so we obtain a recollement
of the form (4). Now the claim follows from Lemma 1.
(ii) Choose I such that, under the equivalence M ∼

corresponds to GinjC (C) (I). Then, for a subcoalgebra D of C, we have XC D = 0 for

all X ∈ i∈C N(i) if and only if IC D = 0. The claim now follows from Proposition
19.

4. Examples
4.1. Projective functors over dual numbers. Let R = k[x]/(x2 ) be the ring of dual
numbers. Consider the 2-category C R of projective functors on R-mod, see e.g. [MM1,
Example 2]. More precisely, this is the 2-category with one object i, which we identify
with a small category R equivalent to R-mod, and C R (i, i) is the full subcategory
of all endofunctors of R given by functors isomorphic to tensoring over R with an
R-R-bimodule in add(R ⊕ R ⊗k R).
The 2-category C R has two indecomposable 1-morphisms 1 and F corresponding to
the identity functor and to tensoring with R ⊗ R, respectively.
Since the principal 2-representation P = C R (i, −) is generated by 1, we have a coalgebra 1-morphism CP corresponding to P given by [1, 1]. Using the fact that the
underlying category of P is precisely C R , one can see that [1, 1] ∼
= 1 as an object in
C R (i, i) and comultiplication and counit are both the identity map. Note that this
argument applies for any principal 2-representation of a finitary 2-category.
There are two simple transitive 2-representations, denoted by CL , C1 , up to equivalence
(see [MM5] for details). Here C1 is the trivial 2-representation, whose underlying
category is equivalent to k-mod, where F acts by annihilating everything. On the other
hand, CL is the natural 2-representation, whose underlying category is equivalent to
R-proj, where F acts as R ⊗k R ⊗R −.
It follows from [MMMT, Theorem 22] that the as an object of C R (i, i), the coalgebra
1-morphism CL := [R, R] is isomorphic to F. For C1 , the corresponding coalgebra
1-morphism C1 := [k, k] can be calculated via the defining adjunction isomorphisms
HomC R (C1 , G) ∼
= HomC1 (i) (k, Gk) for all indecomposable 1-morphisms G, which
yield that it is is isomorphic to the simple socle L1 of 1 in C R (i, i). In fact, C1 is a
quotient 2-representation of P, so C1 is a subcoalgebra of CP , which implies that the
counit and comultiplication maps defining C1 are both the identity map on L1 .
There is a short exact sequence of finitary 2-representations
0 → CL ⊠ A → P → C1 → 0,
where CL ⊠ A is the inflation of CL by A := R-proj (see [MM6] for details about
inflations). Computing coalgebra 1-morphism corresponding to CL ⊠ A via the defining
adjunction isomorphism HomC ([R ⊗ R, R ⊗ R], F) ∼
= HomCL ⊠A (R ⊗ R, F(R ⊗ R))
shows that its underlying object in C R (i, i) is isomorphic to F⊕F. Thus, the coalgebra
1-morphisms D, C in Theorem 20 corresponding to the above short exact sequence are
C1 , CP . Since the quotient of 1 by L1 has simple socle LF , the coalgebra 1-morphism
is A = [F, F] and it has underlying object in C R (i, i) given by F ⊕ F.
Let us look at another finitary 2-representation M, whose underlying category is equivalent to Λ-proj, where Λ := EndR (R ⊕ k) (the action of C R is naturally induced by
that on the natural 2-representation CL ). There is a short exact sequence of
0 → CL → M → C1 → 0.

22

AARON CHAN AND VANESSA MIEMIETZ

We already explained that the coalgebra 1-morphisms A, D corresponding to the first
and last term, respectively, are F and L1 . It is possible to calculate the object in
C R (i, i) underlying the coalgebra 1-morphism CM corresponding to M as follows.
First note that there is a quotient morphism P → M, so we can take CM is to
be the subcoalgebra of CP given by [M, M ] with M being the underlying object of
CM in C = P(i). Note that the internal Hom used here is taken in P (instead
of M). The underlying object of CP is the injective object 1 of C R (i, i), and 1
turns out to be uniserial with four composition factor, LF , L1 , LF , L1 from top to
socle, where LF is the simple socle of F. By the above short exact sequence, C1 is
coidempotent subcoalgebra of CM and C1 ≇ CM , so the underlying object is not L1 .
Since CP ≇ CM , the underlying object M of CM can only be either the length 2 or
the length 3 subobject of 1. These two objects can be distinguished by the dimension
of the Hom-space of maps to 1 in C - they are of dimension 1 and 2 respectively.
By construction, M ∼
= [M, M ] = CM as objects in P(i) (c.f. Proof of Lemma 8)
and HomC (CM , 1) ∼
= HomP (M, M ). Note that HomP (M, M ) ∼
= HomM (M, M ) as
M(i) → P(i) is a fully faithful embedding.
We claim that HomM (M, M ) ∼
= k; in which case, we can conclude that M is the
subobject of 1 of length 2. Indeed, under the equivalence between the underlying
category of M and Λ-proj, M corresponds to the indecomposable projective Λ-module
P such that F(P ) ∈
/ add(P ). By the construction of 2-representation structure on
Λ-proj, F(P ′ ) ∈ add(P ′ ) for an indecomposable projective Λ-module P ′ if and only
if P ′ ∼
= HomR (R ⊕ k, R). So we have P ∼
= HomR (R ⊕ k, k), which is a uniserial
module with a 1-dimensional endomorphism ring; this means that HomM (M, M ) = k,
as claimed.
Note that the comultiplication and counit maps defining CM are both identity, since
CM is a subcoalgebra of CP .
Let us summarise, for clarity, the object underlying each coalgebra 1-morphism corresponding to the 2-representations mentioned, in the table below.

4.2. Triangular coalgebras. In this section, we provide a more general class of examples. Let C be a weakly fiat 2-category, A and D coalgebra 1-morphisms in C with
comultiplications and counits given by µA , ǫA and µD , ǫD , respectively, and A MD a
A-D-bicomodule with left and right coactions λ respectively ρ. We define a coalgebra
structure µC , ǫC on C := A ⊕ D ⊕ M by specifying that
• the restriction of µC to X is µX for X ∈ {C, D},
• the restriction of ǫC to X is ǫX for X ∈ {C, D},


λ
• the restriction of µC to M is
: M → AM ⊕ MD, and
µ
• the restriction of ǫC to M is zero.
It is straightforward to check that this indeed defines a coalgebra structure on C.
We claim that D is a coidempotent subcoalgebra. It is a subcoalgebra by definition, so
we need to check that µ−1
C (CD + DC) = D. Now we have
CD + DC ∼
= AD ⊕ DD ⊕ MD + DA ⊕ DM ⊕ DD.
−1
As none of AD, DA, DM is in the range of µC , we have µ−1
C (CD + DC) = µC (DD ⊕
MD). Since µC sends M to AM ⊕ MD, but only MD is a direct summand of CD + DC,

we get that

−1
µ−1
(0) ∩ ρ−1 (MD) .
C (DD ⊕ MD) = µD (DD) ⊕ λ

−1
It follows from the construction that µ−1
(0) = 0 due to λ
D (DD) = D, whereas λ
−1
being mono, so we obtain µC (CD + DC) = D, i.e. D is coidempotent as claimed.
