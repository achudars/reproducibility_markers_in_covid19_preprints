The Commensal Radio Astronomy Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) Survey (CRAFTS) utilizes the
novel drift-scan commensal survey mode of FAST and can generate billions of pulsar candidate signals. The human experts are
not likely to thoroughly examine these signals, and various machine sorting methods are used to aid the classification of the FAST
candidates. In this study, we propose a new ensemble classification system for pulsar candidates. This system denotes the further
development of the pulsar image-based classification system (PICS), which was used in the Arecibo Telescope pulsar survey, and
has been retrained and customized for the FAST drift-scan survey. In this study, we designed a residual network model comprising
15 layers to replace the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PICS. The results of this study demonstrate that the new model
can sort >96% of real pulsars to belong the top 1% of all candidates and classify > 1.6 million candidates per day using a dual–
GPU and 24–core computer. This increased speed and efficiency can help to facilitate real-time or quasi-real-time processing of the
pulsar-search data stream obtained from CRAFTS. In addition, we have published the labeled FAST data used in this study online,
which can aid in the development of new deep learning techniques for performing pulsar searches.

1 Introduction
Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit radio wave
pulses via their strong magnetic fields. They serve as extraordinary astrophysical laboratories for studying both nu-

clear physics and strong gravitation. Thus far, less than 2,700
pulsars have been discovered throughout the galaxy, and
the majority of these pulsars have been discovered through
pulsar surveys using radio telescopes. A large number of
pulsars have been discovered in modern pulsar surveys, in-

cluding the Parkes multi-beam pulsar survey (PMPS; [1]),
the high time resolution universe (HTRU) survey [2], the
pulsar Arecibo L-band feed array (PALFA) survey [3], the
Green Bank Telescope (GBT) drift-scan pulsar survey [4],
the Green Bank North Celestial Cap (GBNCC) survey [5],
and the low-frequency array (LOFAR) tied-array all-sky survey (LOTAAS; [6]). Modern pulsar surveys often produce a
large number of potential candidates; however, only a small
fraction of these candidates are actual pulsars. For example,
the HTRU survey produced several million pulsar candidates,
and the GBT drift-scan pulsar observation project produced
more than 1.2 million pulsar candidates [4, 7]. The Fivehundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST)
was installed on September 25, 2016, and is currently being
commissioned [8]. The FAST science team used a single–
pixel feed and conducted an initial drift-scan pulsar survey,
producing more than 10 million candidates before May 2018.
Since then, a FAST 19–beam receiver has been installed, generating more than one million pulsar candidates per night. It
is infeasible for such a large number of candidates to be individually examined by several experts; therefore, we propose a
deep-learning–based pulsar candidate selection system. This
system has been modified based on the pulsar image-based
classification system (PICS) and customized for conducting
the FAST drift-scan survey. We have designed a ResNet
model comprising 15 layers to replace the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PICS. The resulting model can run
on both the CPU and GPU platforms and surpasses PICS in
terms of both effectiveness and runtime.
The Commensal Radio Astronomy FasT Survey
(CRAFTS; [9]) is a multi-objective drift-scan survey that
has been conducted based on the FAST. We intend to use
the FAST 19–beam L-band receiver in drift mode to observe
the visible sky of the FAST for HI emission and new pulsars. The drift-scan mode survey produces a large number
of pulsar candidates because of the large survey time and
small integration time (∼12s); additionally, it generates pulsar candidates that emerge and subsequently disappear as
the pulsars drift away. These candidates may differ from the
canonical pulsar candidates that are often used for training
previous pulsar classification systems. The radio frequency
interference (RFI) environment of the FAST also differs from
that of other telescopes. Therefore, it is crucial to train a new
pulsar classifier for conducting this new large-scale survey.
This study utilizes the pulsar and RFI data obtained from a
previous work and other telescopes and combines them with
the new data obtained from the FAST survey. This serves to
produce a novel system that is intend to be more generalized
than the PICS, which is its predecessor.
In Section 2, we describe the pipeline of the pulsar candidates and review various types of automatic pulsar candidate selection. We further introduce the ResNet model,
which is our method. In Section 3, we introduce the FAST,
PALFA, and HTRU pulsar datasets and describe the manner
in which we conducted the experiments using the data ob-

tained from the GBNCC and FAST. Our experimental results
denote that the proposed pulsar candidate selection method
runs efficiently and exhibits high recognition accuracy. Finally, Section 4 presents the discussions and conclusions.

2 Machine learning method for pulsar candidate selection
In this section, we explain the generation of pulsar candidates, summarize a previous study related to automatic pulsar candidate selection, and discuss the design of our 15-layer
ResNet model.
2.1 Pulsar candidates and selection methods
In their study, Lyon et al. (2016) [10] described a general
procedure for detecting pulsars. A telescope system collects radio signals over a large number of frequency channels at a high time resolution (usually < 1 ms of the sample
time). The RFI–contaminated frequency channels are eliminated, and the signals are further de-dispersion to form the
time series for several different dispersion trails. Dispersion
refers to the transmission of radio signals having different
frequencies through the interstellar medium while encountering various delays. These delays, if not accounted for,
can reduce the signal–to–noise ratio (S/N) of the pulsar signal. For an unknown pulsar, the exact dispersion value is unknown [11]. Therefore, several different dispersion measures
(DMs) should be considered. The subsequent step involves
searching for the periodic signals in the time series of different DMs using Fourier analysis. Further, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the time series data can be obtained, and the
results can be examined for the presence of significant power
peaks. Some pulsars have considerably narrow pulses. The
FFT of narrow pulses tends to spread to multiple harmonic
frequencies, and this problem can be addressed by harmonic
summing, which is the subsequent step during pulsar search.
A maximum of 32 harmonics are often summed to produce
the highest signal peaks. The signals that are detected with
sufficiently large Fourier power are considered to be the candidate signals. Majority of these candidates are related to an
RFI or known periodicity and can be referred to as birdies.
The signals that are related to these birdies or that have RFIlike distributions are discarded during this stage. Finally, a
large number of remaining candidates are retained for performing further analysis. Further, the diagnostic plots and
summary statistics are calculated for these candidate signals
by folding the original data using each signal’s DM and period. The diagnostic plots contain a small set of features that
include the signal’s S/N, DM, period, pulse width, integrated
pulse profile, and two-dimensional (2D) plots that display the
signals’ variance with respect to time, frequency, and DM.
We used the PulsaR Exploration and Search TOolkit
(presto) pipeline software for implementing the aforementioned steps. This software generates candidate diagnostic

plots. Figure 1 presents an example of a pulsar candidate plot
based on the FAST drift-scan survey. Further, we can examine the candidates using the following four important subplots: the summed profile plot, the phase versus time plot, the
phase versus frequency plot, and the DM curve plot. These
plots are the four fundamental features that are considered by
the human experts to classify the candidates. The positive
(pulsar, Figure 1) and negative (non-pulsar, Figure 2) candidates exhibit different characteristics.

Figure 1 Real pulsar candidate obtained from the FAST drift-scan survey.
The time domain displays an intermittent signal caused by the pulsar drifting in and out of the beam. The phase versus time plot reveals a significant
subpulse drift in the pulsar.

Figure 2 The example of a non-pulsar candidate obtained from the FAST
data. The frequency versus phase plot contains features that resemble the
pulsar signals. However, upon close examination, these features become entirely vertical when the plot is refolded with DM set to zero, demonstrating
that the signal is not dispersed. Thus, this candidate is most likely to have
originated from the ground interference.

Recently, there has been an increase in the usage of computational intelligence and machine learning technology in
various fields of astronomy [12]. Several researchers have
successfully applied machine learning, which has significantly improved the efficiency of the pulsar searches, to
perform pulsar candidate selection. Eatough et al. (2010)
[13] extracted 12 features of pulsar candidates and trained
a single-hidden-layer artificial neural network, discovering
a new pulsar in their PMPS data. Lee et al. (2013) [14]
proposed a pulsar scoring method that can be referred to
as the pulsar evaluation algorithm for candidate extraction
(PEACE), which focuses on the quantitative evaluation of six
features of a candidate and determines whether this candidate is a pulsar. Bates et al. (2012) [15] adopted 22 features
and trained a single-hidden-layer artificial neural network.
Morello et al. (2014) [16] proposed straightforward pulsar
identification using neural networks (SPINN), whose design
contained six artificial features in the input layer, eight neurons in the hidden layers, and one neuron in the output layer.
Lyon et al. (2016) [10] proposed a pulsar candidate selection method based on a decision tree, which can be referred
to as the Gaussian Hellinger very fast decision tree (GHVFDT) and contains eight features obtained from the diagnostic histograms to describe a pulsar candidate. This model
has been successfully applied in LOTAAS. For improving
the pulsar recognition accuracy, Guo et al. (2017) [17] proposed DCGAN + L2-SVM to address the class imbalance
problem. They used DCGAN to learn features and trained
an L2-support vector machine (L2-SVM) model to predict
the results. The FRB search method is similar to the pulsar
search method; Connor et al. (2018) [18] applied a tree-like
deep neural network (DNN) to the FRB searches. Zhang et
al. (2018) [19] were the first to utilize the ResNet architecture for detecting fast radio bursts, and they detected 72 new
pulses from FRB 121102 that had not been identified by the
S/N-based methods in previous searches [20].
Artificial neural networks, especially CNNs, have played
an important role in earlier pulsar candidate selection. For instance, Zhu et al. (2014) [21] proposed a pulsar image-based
classification system. In accordance with the four important
features of a pulsar candidate (the summed profile, time versus phase plot, frequency versus phase plot, and DM curve),
they developed the design of an ensemble network combined
with a single-hidden-layer network, an SVM, and a CNN.
Among these, CNNs have demonstrated good classification
performance for 2D diagnostic plots. For example, a CNN is
a typical end-to-end model when compared to other methods.
In constrast, other methods require hand-crafted features for
performing automatic pulsar candidate selection. Therefore,
it is necessary for a pulsar expert to design artificial features,
which may decrease the efficiency of pulsar candidate selection. However, the objective of this study is to replace the
CNN with ResNet in PICS, which is developed using a TensorFlow framework for classifying the efficiency.

2.2 Residual network design
A CNN is an excellent feature extractor because it performs
end-to-end learning of the raw image data to be classified.
In PICS, the CNN model is relatively slow in training and
classification because it is not optimized to run on either a
CPU or a GPU. In addition, for legitimate pulsar candidates,
there are one or more vertical lines in the 2D subplot (time
versus phase and frequency versus phase); these features are
usually captured in the early layers of the neural network.
However, CRAFTS generates a wide range of pulsar candidates, especially those exhibiting sub-pulse drift. Deep networks must be designed to recognize these complex features.
Therefore, we have adopted a residual network model [22]
based on GPU acceleration for performing 2D subplot classification.

A residual network can be considered to be a typical CNN.
Deep networks tend to have a low back propagation error owing to gradient degradation; this problem arises during the
deep network training process. The error term gradually decreases during the process of backward propagation, reducing the learning effectiveness in the top layers of the network.
He et al. [22] proposed a residual learning framework (Figure 3) to address this degradation problem. The principle of
this approach involves an "identity-connection" that connects
the blocks of the convolutional layers and computes the shallow and deep features. The identity connections are shortcuts
preventing the gradients from vanishing too rapidly. Thus,
multiple residual networks can be stacked together to form
deep networks without suffering from gradient degradation.
In practice, this type of deep residual network can improve
the classification accuracy. Hardt et al. (2016) [23], Du et
al. (2018) [24] have also proposed theories for ensuring the
effectiveness of the ResNet method.
We designed the ResNet architecture according to the characteristics of the 2D subplots of pulsar candidates and the experimentation performed using various combinations of hyperparameters. We varied the network depth, feature map
numbers, and kernel size and observed the changes in classification accuracy. Further, we determined the network structure and hyperparameters based on multiple factors, includ-

ing the computation time, classification accuracy, and performance convergence. We conducted an experiment using networks of different depths and discovered that both a shallow
9-layer ResNet and a deep 39-layer ResNet exhibited lower
accuracy than that exhibited by a 15-layer ResNet. Thus, our
ResNet model comprises 15 layers (Figure 4). The network
layers include one input convolutional layer, two output layers, and 12 convolutional layers. The 12 convolutional layers are divided into three groups, each group containing two
residual blocks and each residual block containing two convolutional layers. Figure 3 displays the structure of a residual
block; in each residual block, the parameters of the two convolutional layers are identical, and two residual blocks in the
same group are observed to be identical to each other. After
the residual blocks is the 14 th layer, which is a global average pooling layer that is connected to the 15 th layer, a fully
connected softmax output layer.
While using this model to classify the pulsar candidates,
we preprocessed the feature data before feeding them to the
neural network. This procedure involved re-scaling the data
to the zero mean and unit variance and shifting the peak to a
phase of 0.5 for both the pulsar profile and 2D plots; however,
we did not shift the peak of the DM curve.
Figure 4 presents the design of the ResNet model used for
classifying the 2D images. We extracted four main features
plots of a candidate from the pfd files; these plots included
one-dimensional (1D) data arrays (summed profile and DM
curve) and 2D data arrays (time versus phase and frequency
versus phase subplots). Further, the original size of the feature data varied among various candidates. However, because our machine learning models functioned only using input data of identical size, we downsampled or interpolated
the data to a uniform size before feeding them to our model.
For a 1D subplot, we applied an SVM model in which the
size of the input array was 64 × 1. In contrast, for the 2D
subplot, we used the ResNet model in which the size of the
input array was 64 × 64.

3 Results
In this section, we present the training and validation of
PICS–ResNet, which is our new model and compare it with
its predecessor, which is a generic PICS model. The generic
PICS model used in this study exhibits the same architecture as that exhibited by the model described by Zhu et al.
(2014) [21] but with several differences. The original PICS
model used a Bayesian prior to reject RFIs based on the frequency population of all the candidates (Lee et al. 2013 [14];
Zhu et al. 2014 [21]). The PICS model in this study is trained
with a larger amount of data than that used to train the original model; however, it does not reject RFIs based on their
periods. Further, the results of the following three experiments designed to test robustness of the models are presented:
1. training both the models using an old dataset and testing
them using the GBNCC dataset; 2. training both the mod-

els using a new dataset, including the FAST data, and testing
them using the GBNCC dataset; 3. testing the models trained
with the FAST data using a small set of reserved FAST test
data. The results demonstrate that the PICS–ResNet model
converges better in training and outperforms the PICS model
in testing. Both the models display improvement after being
trained with new data obtained from the FAST, exhibiting a
recall rate of more than 90% .
3.1 Datasets and evaluation metrics
The pulsar candidate datasets that were used included the
PALFA, HTRU, GBNCC, and FAST datasets (Table 1).
Some of the datasets, such as the PALFA and GBNCC
datasets, were used and presented in a previous study [21].
The HTRU dataset was obtained via private communication
with C. Ng, while the FAST data was collected in this study.
Similar to Zhu et al. (2014) [21], we used the GBNCC dataset
as an independent test dataset to verify the generalization of
the models. Table 1 displays the number of positive and
negative examples in each dataset. In the GBNCC dataset,
the positive candidates contained two types of labels, among
which one indicated the fundamental signals of the pulsars,
whereas the other indicated the harmonic signals of the pulsars.

3.2 Model training
In this subsection, we describe the training process of the
15-layer ResNet and PICS–ResNet models and observe the
manner in which the models can converge. We used the
same dataset, which included the PALFA, HTRU, and FAST
dataset (Table 1) for training. There were a total of 13,632
labeled candidates in this dataset, among which 5,692 were
pulsars (and their harmonic signals) and 7,940 were nonpulsars.
We used grid search to fine-tune the hyperparameters of
the ResNet and selected the set of parameters leading to
the optimal cross-validation F 1 score and as well as a wellconverging model. For the cross-validation tests, we randomly select 80% of the entire dataset for training and the
remaining 20% for performing validation. Figure 6 illustrates
the convergence of the 15 layers of the ResNet over the training process. The hyperparameters of the ResNet model were
set to an initial learning rate of 0.01, a batch size of 32, a
weight decay rate of 0.002, a ReLU leakiness of 0.1, and a
training epoch of 80.

We generally consider pulsar candidate selection to be a

occasionally contain more than two labels. In our dataset,

examples, while all the RFIs are considered to be negative
examples. The evaluation metrics that are adopted for performing pulsar candidate classification are precision, recall

The training and validation tests were performed to determine the manner in which the models converged and to
identify the signs of overfitting. In the training process, we

We first used 2,000 samples to train the model, followed by
the usage of 1,363 samples for validation. Next, we increased
the training set size to 12,000. In each step, we randomly selected 1,363 samples as validation data; these data did not
contain the training data. We performed five independent
cross-validation tests to evaluate the reliability of the training process, with each test exhibiting a different random split

Figure 7 demonstrates that the training and validation
scores of both the PICS and PICS–ResNet models improve
as the size of the training set increases and that the PICS–
ResNet model converges better than the PICS model. The results indicate that the training size remains insufficient for the
training and validation curve to completely converge and that
some degree of overfitting still exists in the models. However, the PICS–ResNet demonstrates slightly superior performance and convergence when compared to those exhibited
by the PICS. The mean validation F 1 score is 0.92 for PICS
and 0.92 for PICS–ResNet.

3.3 Generalization test using the GBNCC dataset
To independently validate our model, we applied it to a large
set of GBNCC candidates that were excluded while training
the model. Similar to the FAST, PALFA, and HTRU, the GBNCC survey used the presto search pipeline to generate candidates in the pfd file format; however, it used a low observing frequency (∼300 MHz). Thus, the RFI environments are
unique to the Green Bank telescope. All the candidates in the
GBNCC dataset were verified and labeled by unprejudiced

human experts; therefore, this dataset represents a realistic
survey. However, similar to any genuine survey candidate
pool, the dataset is considerably imbalanced. There are 56
pulsars, 221 harmonics, and 89,731 RFI candidates (Table 1).
The result of the GBNCC dataset serve to measure the performance of our model in a realistic pulsar survey and to test its
generalizability with respect to a different telescope, different
observing frequency, and different RFI environment.
To determine whether the inclusion of new data improves
the performance and generalization of the models, we conducted experiments using the GBNCC test data using the following two steps: 1. we trained our models using an old
dataset that excluded the FAST data, and 2. we further trained
the models using a large dataset that included FAST data. In
training the PICS–ResNet model, we collected 11,797 training samples from the PALFA and the HTRU South survey
(Table 1). The model ran for 80 epochs, usually with an iterative process and a checkpoint being saved after each epoch.
In addition, we used a standard momentum optimizer as the
learning algorithm for training in which the initial learning
rate was set to 0.01, the weight decay was set to 0.002, and
the batch size set to 32. We used the same training set to train
the PICS model; the results are presented in Table 4. PICS
sorted 52 pulsar fundamental signals and 194 harmonics into
the top 1% of 90,008 candidates, while PICS–ResNet sorted
51 fundamental signals and 190 harmonics into the top 1%.
The recall curves of the two models are denoted in Figure 8.
The total number of pulsar fundamental signals is 56, and
the number of harmonics is 221. Table 4 reveals that when
trained with the old dataset, both PICS and PICS–ResNet
reach a ∼90% recall rate for the GBNCC test by considering only the top 1% of the candidates.
Table 4 Classification results of the PICS and PICS–ResNet models using the GBNCC dataset when the models were trained with the PALFA and
HTRU data but not the FAST data. Only the candidates who were ranked
in the top 1% of the dataset were selected, and the recall rates of the pulsars
and their harmonics were calculated.

total of 13,632 samples (see Table 1) were used from the
PALFA, HTRU, and FAST. The test results are presented in
Table 5. PICS–Resnet sorted 54 fundamental pulsars and 211
harmonics. Among the results, the top 210 candidates were
all pulsars, with the first non-pulsar being the 211th candidate. There were 254 pulsars among the top 290 candidates.
We used the same training data to train the PICS, and the
resulting model sorted 52 fundamental pulsars and 201 of
their harmonics into the top 1% of all the candidates. Table 5 demonstrate that when trained with the FAST data, both
PICS and PICS–ResNet exhibited superior performance, and
PICS–ResNet reached a ∼96% recall rate in the GBNCC test
by considering only the top 1% of all the candidates. Figure 8 displays the recall curves for the two models trained
using FAST data. The results reveal that the inclusion of new
data obtained from the FAST significantly improved the models’ recall rates with respect to the harmonic signals of pulsars. We conclude that increasing the size and diversity of the
training data can increase the generalization of the models.
Table 5 Classification results of the PICS and PICS–ResNet models using the GBNCC dataset. The models were trained with datasets from the
PALFA, HTRU, and FAST. Only the candidates ranked in the top 1% of the
dataset were selected, and the recall rates of the pulsars and their harmonics
were calculated.

and two 1080Ti GPUs. In contrast, it took the CNN model of
the PICS system ∼7.2 ms to process one 2D plot. It should
be noted that our method ran efficiently because the CPU and
GPU were running concurrently. It took PICS–ResNet 61 s
and PICS 95 s to predict 10,000 candidates. Overall, it took
∼79 minutes for PICS–ResNet and ∼90 minutes for PICS to
complete the classification of 90,008 candidates. The PICS–
ResNet model exhibits a slightly faster performance than that
exhibited by the PICS model.
3.4 Testing using the FAST data
We used new data collected from the FAST drift–scan survey to further verify the robustness of our model. We collected 317,018 candidates from the survey; 15,542 were labeled by human experts, among which 1,163 were pulsars
or their harmonics (hereafter simply referred to as pulsars).
Both the PICS and PICS–ResNet models were trained with
13,632 samples (Table 1), including 1,835 samples obtained
from the FAST data. An additional 326 pulsar samples and
13,321 RFI samples from the FAST data were reserved for
testing. Table 6 reveals that PICS–ResNet identified 320 pulsars and missed six, while PICS identified 310 pulsars and
missed 16. This demonstrates that when the FAST data is
used, PICS can achieve a recall rate of 95%, whereas PICS–
ResNet can achieve a recall rate of 98%. In this experiment,
the recall rate was calculated using a score threshold of 0.5.
This was because the FAST test data was not as imbalanced
as the GBNCC data, and there would have been considerably
few candidates in the top 1% to include all the true positive
samples. Therefore, the recall numbers in Tables 6 and 5
should not be directly compared.

fraction of the candidates examined, whereas the y-axis represents the recall
rate of the examined candidates. Here, the recall rate is calculated based
on the fraction of pulsar signals (including 56 fundamental signals and 221
harmonic signals) ranked in the top X fraction of the candidates.

While testing using the GBNCC dataset, we also evaluated
the runtime of the models. It took the ResNet model ∼0.22 ms
to process one 2D plot using a cluster of 24 2.7–GHz CPUs

In this study, we propose PICS–ResNet, which is a new ensemble model for pulsar candidate selection. This model inherits a two-layer structure from PICS [21] and replaces the
lower-layer CNN classifier with a ResNet-based model for
performing 2D data classification. The PICS–ResNet model
uses 15 layers of a deep neural network to identify 2D subplots and utilizes SVM to identify a 1D subplot. Our experimental results demonstrate that the PICS–ResNet model
converges better than the PICS model during training and
performs better than the PICS model when trained with the
FAST data. In addition, when the FAST data is considered in
training, the resulting models exhibit improved preformance
in a test using the GBNCC data and a test using the FAST
data. When trained with the FAST data and tested with the

GBNCC data, PICS–ResNet sorts 96% pulsars into the top
1% of all the candidates. In addition, an experiment using
FAST pulsar survey data demonstrates that PICS–ResNet can
identify 98% of pulsars with a score threshold of 0.5.
Our experiments demonstrate that the ResNet model itself
does not display significant signs of overfitting while classifying the 2D image features (Figure 6); however, the ensemble
model appears to display slight overfitting, as illustrated by
the learning curve (Figure 7). This remains a caveat because
it is helpful in practice to exhibit a considerable separation
in final scores while applying this model to data. In addition, our experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion
of the data obtained from the FAST enhances the recall rate
of the models with respect to the pulsar (harmonic) signals.
Therefore, we can conclude that the training data exhibit insufficient diversity and that gathering additional data is an effective method for improving the pulsar candidate selection
accuracy. Further, the simulated data can also be used as a
supplement to the real data obtained from various surveys.
The PICS–ResNet model was developed using the TensorFlow platform, and our experiments revealed that it can classify more than 1.6 million candidates per day using a dual
GPU 24-core desktop computer (see Section 3.3 for more
details). The development code of the PICS–ResNet model
can be found at https://github.com/dzuwhf/PICS-ResNet. In
addition, our labeled FAST data has been made public on
https://github.com/dzuwhf/FAST_label_data.
