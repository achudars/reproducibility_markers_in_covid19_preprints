Abstract: Safe theories are quantum field theories whose continuum limit is defined by a
non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point when the ultraviolet cutoff is removed. They constitute an important set in the space of quantum field theories. Here we develop the ‘safe’
gauge-string correspondence program according to which d-dimensional safe gauge theories,
admitting the ‘t Hooft-Veneziano limit, are holographically dual to (d + 1)-dimensional safe
noncritical string theories on asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. We provide evidences for
this correspondence on a class of safe templates that engage fermion and scalar matter fields
into gauge, Yukawa and Higgs self-interactions. Safe theories can feature in the infrared both
a weak coupling phase and a strong coupling phase on either side of the ultraviolet fixed point.
They correspond respectively to dilaton and warp factors taking domain-wall or Liouville-wall
profiles on asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. We argue that four-dimensional N = 4 super
Yang-Mills theories and all known interacting (super)conformal field theories are nonperturbative limit situations of safe gauge theories. The weak coupling phase provides a solvable
holographic renormalization group flow while the strong coupling infrared phase provides a
runaway-free alternative to holographic QCD.

Introduction

The anti-de Sitter / conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence [1] asserts the existence of a weak-strong duality between conformal field theories in d-dimensional spacetime
and string theory in (d + 1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. The correspondence have
been explored for various conformal field theories up to d = 6 dimensions, predominantly with
supersymmetry to attain better analytic control. Among the most studied models, is N = 4
super Yang-Mills theory [2] in four dimensions which is dual to the N = 4 anti-de Sitter string
theory in five dimensions. The N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory is known as the simplest quantum field theory. With the beta function vanishing exactly [3–7]), this theory is conformally
invariant and its gauge coupling parameter takes an arbitrary value. An outstanding question is whether the AdS/CFT correspondence extends to the more intricate class of gauge
and string theories. For example, the Standard Model [8, 9] of the real world1 consisting of
chiral fermions and Higgs scalar interact through chiral gauge, Yukawa and Higgs couplings
and these couplings all run with energy scales. With three generations, the strong and weak
sectors become asymptotically free in the ultraviolet while the hypercharge and Higgs sectors
hit Landau poles toward the ultraviolet.
It is widely viewed that the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, which describes the lowenergy dynamics (below the string scale Ms ) of stacked D3-branes, is a limit situation2 of

quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [10], the strong sector of the Standard Model. Modulo
differences that the gauge group SU (3) is enlarged to SU (Nc ) and the quarks transforming
as the fundamental representation of SU (3) are now fermions and scalars transforming as the
adjoint representation of SU (Nc ) (these matter fields combine with gluons to form the N = 4
supermultiplet), in essence, both theories are vectorial and non-abelian gauge theories. As
such, one might hope to better understand nonperturbative aspects of the QCD from the
simpler, N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory by itself and from its AdS/CFT correspondence.
Variants of this view were further put forward by coupling the N = 4 super YangMills theory (starting with D3-branes) to matter fields in fundamental representation (which
amounts to introducing D7 and anti-D7-branes) [11] or by embedding the N = 4 super
Yang-Mills theory into five dimensions (now starting with D4-branes), then compactified
on a circle with thermal boundary conditions [12] and also by further adding quarks in
the fundamental and anti-fundamental representations (which amounts to introducing D8
and anti-D8 branes) [13]. It was found that these setups captured numerous low-energy
manifestations of non-abelian Yang-Mills theories and, in particular of QCD, yet because of
the dramatic differences in their ultraviolet completion, they are left unsolved with multitudes
of technical and conceptual difficulties and puzzles.
For instance, what sets the N = 4 super Yang-Mills dynamics apart from the asymptotically free QCD [14, 15] is that its coupling is fixed and finite at all scales. Because of this
conformal invariance, it is impossible to develop a mass gap in the infrared (even if the couplings are sent to infinity). While the conformal invariance may be softly broken by fermion
and scalar masses (and decouple them from the infrared dynamics), it is also impossible to
develop partons exhibiting the Bjorken scaling in the ultraviolet (unless the coupling is tuned
to zero)3 . This casts doubts to the aforementioned connection and poses an interesting question as to what class of gauge theories the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory can be more closely
be seen as a limit situation.
In this paper, we assert that the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory is better interpreted as
a limit situation of safe gauge theories than of asymptotically free ones. By the same token,
we also assert that all known interacting conformal field theories in various dimensions and
with various amount of supersymmetries, are also better interpreted as a limit situation of
safe gauge theories than of asymptotically free ones. Moreover, we develop a safe gaugestring correspondence for a class of safe gauge theories4 . By safe gauge theory, we refer
to interacting gauge theory whose existence in the infinite cutoff limit is defined by a nonGaussian ultraviolet stable fixed point. The theory may flow out toward the infrared to a
weak coupling phase of either Gaussian (like QED) or non-Gaussian (viz. interacting) fixed
point. Alternately the theory may flow toward the infrared to a strong coupling phase of color
confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. According to our assertion the N = 4
3

We recall that the notion of parton is well defined only when the quantum field theory is non-interacting
or super-renormalizable. Whether partons are well defined in the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory at strong
coupling was explored in [16] by utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence. The answer is, as expected, negative.

A natural limit of the safe gauge-string correspondence is the conventional AdS/CFT correspondence.

super Yang-Mills theory is the simplest, featureless situation that starting from an ultraviolet
fixed point the theory does not flow to the infrared. Stating our assertion differently, safe
gauge theories better match their dynamics with the dynamics of N = 4 super Yang-Mills
theory5 .

Figure 1. Coupling constant running is illustrated for N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory (blue), safe
gauge theory (orange), and asymptotically free gauge theory (green). The ultraviolet fixed point is
non-Gaussian for safe theories and Gaussian for asymptotically free theories, respectively. It displays
that the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory is more a limit situation of the safe gauge theories than of
the asymptotically free gauge theories. The scales are arbitrary.

Intuitively, we can motivate our assertion by comparing characteristic running of gauge
coupling constants in asymptotically free gauge theory, N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory (as
a representative of interacting conformal field theories), and safe gauge theory, respectively.
When all matter fields (by these, we mean fields other than the gauge fields) are massless,
the gauge coupling constant of each theory runs from asymptotic zero to infinity toward the
infrared, sits at a fixed value, or interpolates from an interacting ultraviolet fixed point to
an infrared fixed point, respectively. Their behavior, illustrated in Fig.1, suggests that the
N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory would dynamically behave more like safe gauge theories than
asymptotically free gauge theories.
The similarity extends if the matter fields are made massive. Below the mass scale, all
three theories behave effectively as pure Yang-Mills theory and their coupling constants runs
to infinity toward the scale of dynamically generated mass gap. Above the mass scale, the
running coupling constant of respective theory approaches the massless counterpart in the
ultraviolet. Their behavior, illustrated in Figure 2, again points to the suggestion that the
N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory behaves more like safe gauge theories than asymptotically
free gauge theories.
Turning our proposal around, the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory furnishes non-perturbative
data points in the space of safe gauge theories, as its ultraviolet fixed point is exact and forms
5

Another simplest safe (gauge) theory is the free field theory. Its beta function is trivially zero, and its
coupling vanishes. It is the theory defined by an isolated Gaussian fixed point. In all known cases, a safe gauge
theory would flow between two interacting fixed points or between an ultraviolet interacting fixed point and
an infrared QCD-like, mass-gapped dynamics.

a line of stable fixed points (the C1 conformal manifold) to an arbitrarily strong coupling. The
same also holds for all known interacting conformal field theories in various dimensions and
with various supersymmetries, either isolated at a fixed coupling or varying over a conformal
manifold. By the AdS/CFT correspondence, these theories in the strong coupling regime are
most effectively described in terms of the anti-de Sitter string theories in the weak curvature
regime. With this paper, we extend this holographic description to more structured safe gauge
theories. In four dimensions, a class of safe gauge theories was constructed in [17, 18]. These
theories are akin to the Standard Model and involve gauge, Yukawa and scalar couplings
and interpolate between a free or interacting fixed point in the infrared and an interacting
fixed point in the ultraviolet. Taking them as a template, we develop the ‘safe’ gauge-string
correspondence.
An important aspect of safe gauge theories is the existence of, at least, two possible
infrared dynamics; relative to the ultraviolet fixed point, there can be a weak infrared coupling
phase and a strong interacting coupling phase, respectively. While the weak coupling phase is
analytically more amenable, the strong coupling phase is also of equal interest, as it exhibits
essentially the same infrared dynamics as the QCD and so rightfully referred to as safe QCD.
In this paper, we will study both phases; accordingly, we will show that the holographic dual
of this safe template is given by either domain wall (as illustrated in Figure 3) or Liouville
(confining) wall background in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space.
We organize this paper as follows. In Section 2, we review a class of safe gauge theories
constructed in [17], which we refer to as the safe template, and collect its salient features to
be compared with those of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. The idea is to bring to light as
many similarities between these two theories as possible and to lend support of our assertion
that the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory is a time honored, limit of safe gauge theories. We
do so first for the weak coupling phase mainly as it is amenable within analytically controlled
perturbative methods, and then for the strong coupling phase. We also summarize known

These observations allow us, in Section 3, to develop the safe gauge-string correspondence
that, as for the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, safe gauge theories admit holographic duals
for both weak and strong coupling phases. Built upon this result, we propose that safe ddimensional quantum field theories admitting ‘t Hooft [19] or ’t Hooft -Veneziano [20] limits
are holographically dual to (d + 1)-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter string theories
with domain wall or Liouville wall deformations for both the dilaton and the warp factor 6 .
In Section 4, we summarize our proposal and discuss various future directions to advance the
proposed program.

The Safe Gauge Theory

In this section, we present a template of the safe gauge theory and discuss its variants. The
template is the gauge-Yukawa-scalar theory, first constructed in [17]. We highlight salient
aspects of the template and note that they strikingly resemble characteristics of the N = 4
super Yang-Mills theory. We claim that these features are universal to all safe gauge theories
in four dimensions and that the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory is nothing but a subclass of
the safe gauge theories at strong couplings. In the next section, we will draw support to our
claims from holographic dual description by establishing the gauge-string correspondence.
2.1

Safe Template

The safe template of [17] contains (Nc2 −1) non-Abelian gauge fields, Aiµ , Nc Nf massless Dirac
fermions, Ψ = (ψL , ψR ), and Nf2 massless complex-valued scalars, H. The theory is symmetric

flavor transformations. At quantum level, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw axial anomaly reduces the
classical global symmetry to the quantum one, Gf = SU (Nf )L × SU (Nf )R × U (1)V . The leftand right-handed Weyl fermions transform, respectively, in (Nf , 0) and (0, Nf ) representations

the minimal contents. One may introduce multiple (but finite) copies of these matter fields.
In that case, a residual global symmetry Gr may further arise that rotates the matter field
multiplets among themselves. Hereafter, we limit ourselves to the minimal contents but we
will keep the option in mind in foregoing discussions.

Here, g is the gauge coupling constant of the non-Abelian gauge sector and ti , i = 1, . . . , Nc2 −
1, are the generators of SU (Nc ) in the fundamental representation. Tr refers to the trace over
the Gf global symmetry. We define the safe theory as the one with exact Gf flavor symmetry
(which includes single and double trace interactions) and so do not allow any deformations
that breaks Gf flavor symmetry. As such, the four marginal couplings (g, y, u, v) are all there
are for spanning the theory space and they are all singlets under the Gf .
The theory is spanned by, in addition to Nc and Nf , the aforementioned four marginal
couplings: the gauge coupling g, the Yukawa coupling y, the quartic scalar coupling u, and
the double-trace scalar coupling v. Altogether, there are six parameters that are needed for
specifying the safe theory 7 . We will explore the theory in the Veneziano limit 8 :

For brevity, we omit the flavor-diagonal CP violating θ angle parameter. It is just the real part of the

We stress that the exact Gf symmetry is imperative for defining the Veneziano limit unambiguously. In this
regard, the theory space we defined by limiting to the four aforementioned marginal couplings is self-consistent.

as a continuous parameter. Thus, at each fixed value of , we see that in the Veneziano limit
the number of flavors Nf is interlocked to the number of colors Nc . Accordingly, at each fixed
value of , the flavor symmetry Gf is also interlocked to the gauge symmetry Gc .
Safe 1: In safe theories, the flavor global symmetry Gf defined by fermion and scalar
fields is interlocked to the gauge symmetry Gc . The residual global symmetry Gr may
remain independent.
In the Veneziano limit, the topological loop expansion is set by 1/Nc2 . For a fixed Nc ,
the remaining five coupling parameters are the parameter  and the four marginal couplings.
To further study them, we now examine the renormalization group flows of the theory. The
relevant beta functions of the theory was obtained in Ref. [22] in dimensional regularisation.
We use the short-hand notation βi ≡ ∂t αi , with i = (g, y, h, v) and t the logarithm of energy
scale, for the beta functions of the respective couplings (2.5).
Restricted to the gauge sector, viz. in the subspace of the coupling αg , the theory is
asymptotically free for  < 0, while it is infrared free for  > 0 at which the asymptotic
freedom is lost and the gauge dynamics behaves like non-abelian QED. Intriguingly, charted
to the full sector, viz. in the full space of the four couplings αg , αy , αh , αv , it was discovered in
[17] that the theory exhibits an interacting ultraviolet fixed point. It turns out that, provided
0 <   1, this fixed point can be controlled within perturbation theory.
After a careful study of the zeros of the beta functions and taking account of the stability
of the quantum potential [17, 18], one arrives at the unique mathematically and physically
acceptable fixed point accessible within perturbation theory:

We expressed the fixed point in the analytic expansion of the parameter . We see that,
remarkably, the parameter  is interlaced to the fixed point values of the four coupling parameters. We expect the latter to be a robust feature of the safe theory.
Safe 2: In safe theories, the ratio Nf /Nc is intertwined to the values of the couplings
at the non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point.
The existence of such fixed point ensures that the theory is ultraviolet complete, and
so the theory is valid at arbitrarily short distance scales. In particular, scalar interactions
are indispensable while remaining free of the triviality problem because of the presence of an
interacting ultraviolet fixed point. This is a feature shared by the scalar interactions in the
N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, but attained without the help of supersymmetry.
Safe 3: In safe theories, the scalar fields self-interact while avoiding the triviality
problem. Moreover, this property holds without supersymmetry.
The template is also infrared free, since at low energies it is governed by the Gaussian
fixed point:
αg∗ = αy∗ = αh∗ = αv∗ = 0.

The renormalization group flow connecting the Gaussian infrared fixed point and the nonGaussian ultraviolet fixed point is the ultraviolet-complete trajectory, characterising a line
of physics. The latter is also known as separatrix, as it separates different physical regions
of the theory in the space of renormalization group flows. Along the line of physics, the
theory is non-interacting in the infrared and hits the above interacting fixed point in the
ultraviolet. The region of the renormalization group phase diagram emanating from the
ultraviolet-stable fixed point and leading to stable trajectories is known as the ultraviolet
critical surface. Remarkably this critical surface is one-dimensional [17] and it has, clearly, a
dynamical nature. This is so in every known safe theories, and so we promote it as a universal
feature10 .
Safe 4: In safe theories, the couplings flow in scale over a finite but arbitrary interval
set by Nf /Nc . We focus on proper safe theories in which the critical surface is onedimensional.
As elaborated above, the separatrix connects the non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point
with the Gaussian infrared fixed point and it coincides with the critical surface near the
ultraviolet fixed point [17]. Anticipating a holographic dual description, it is illuminating to
consider an analytical approximation that is accurate in the limit of vanishing , yielding the

We are not considering theories in which some of the couplings become free in the ultraviolet and, in any
event, we can always consider safe theories with one dimensional critical surfaces.

The one-dimensional nature of the line of physics is encoded into the fact that in order to
determine the running of all three other couplings it is sufficient to specify the running of the
gauge coupling. Moreover, according to Safe 4, the Veneziano ratio  is completely subsumed
in the specification of the critical surface, so the separatrix is the complete specification of
the line of physics at each order in the 1/Nc2 expansion.

Here, αg0 is the gauge coupling at an arbitrary reference scale µ0 , with µ/µ0 ranging between
0 and ∞ and the gauge coupling ranging between 0 < αg0 < αg∗ . Inserting Eq. (2.9) into Eq.
(2.8), we obtain an analytic description of the renormalization group evolution of all couplings
along the separatrix.
At asymptotically high energies W (µ) vanishes; towards the infrared, it grows. It is
convenient to fix αg0 as a sequence of fraction αg0 ≡ αg∗ /(1 + k) with k ∈ R+ , which in practice
amounts to fixing the arbitrary renormalization reference scale µ0 along the renormalization
group flow. As pointed out in Ref. [18], the value k = 1/2, viz. αg0 = 2αg∗ /3, corresponds
to the exact critical transition scale µ0 = Λcr above which the physics is dominated by the
ultraviolet fixed point and below which it is governed by the infrared fixed point.
Safe 5: In safe theories, the gauge coupling interpolates sharply between the infrared
fixed point behavior and the ultraviolet fixed point behavior across the exact critical
transition scale Λcr .
The interacting nature of the ultraviolet fixed point is expressed by the behavior that it

Safe 6: In safe theories, the scaling violation near the ultraviolet fixed point exhibits
power-law behavior, approaching the fixed point faster than in the asymptotically free
case.
This power-law scaling violation (which is on top of the running of the coupling constant) was
previously known in the context of parton model description of the deeply inelastic scattering
[23]. We refer to Eq.(2.11) as Kogut-Susskind scaling. In the left panel of Fig. 4, we display

the beta function of the gauge coupling along the separatrix. In the right panel of Fig. 4, using
Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9), we also display the running of the four couplings along the separatrix.
The complete asymptotically safe nature of the theory should now be clear: each of the
four coupling parameters approach the nontrivial fixed point value toward the ultraviolet.
We stress that the scalar sector, through its Yukawa interactions, was indispensable for the
existence of the non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point, at least within the perturbative regime
we examined.

Safe Template II: Safe QCD

The phase diagram of the theory was established in Ref. [17] at next-to-next-leading order
accuracy and extended to the next-to-next-to-leading order in Ref. [18], where the effects
from the running scalar couplings were considered. For the sake of being self-contained, we
summarise in Fig. 5 the phase diagram of the theory shown in Ref. [18]. In the left panel, we

also indicated in the left panel the relevant and irrelevant directions dictated by the signs of

details, we refer to Ref. [17, 18].

There are several nice and distinctive features of the analytically controllable and completely asymptotically safe dynamics summarised above. Collecting the features Safe 1
through Safe 5, we find that the safe template considered above constitutes an ideal ground
for investigating properties of the safe theories that for certain aspects resembles N = 4
super Yang-Mills theory. One of the similarities is the fact that along the line of physics
all couplings are related. This is also a fundamental feature of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills
theory due, however, to the high degree of supersymmetry. In the non-supersymmetric case
the relations among the couplings are dynamical in nature being dictated by the dimension
of the critical surface. One may access the non-perturbative regime of the theory by dialing
 large. We expect a critical value of  above which the safety is lost.
There is more physics to explore out of the safe gauge theory. In the phase diagram,
emanating from the ultraviolet fixed point (marked UV in Figure 4), there are two relevant
flows to the infrared, marked as weak and strong, respectively, in Figure 4. So far, we focused
on the weak coupling phase of the flows. The strong coupling phase of the flow is also of
interest, since the safe gauge theory in this region (which we label as safe-QCD hereafter)

In this phase, the ‘t Hooft coupling flows out of the ultraviolet fixed point at a finite
value (of order the Veneziano ratio ) but eventually runs to infinite coupling in the infrared.
This follows from the perturbative beta function shown in the left panel of Figure 4 (along
the line of physics). We deduce that the ‘t Hooft coupling runs in the ultraviolet towards the
interacting fixed point following a power law rather than displaying the asymptotically free
logarithmic behavior. However it runs similarly to QCD in the infrared.
We therefore expect that the safe-QCD theory develops spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking associated to the flavor symmetry Gf = SU (Nf )L × SU (Nf )R and also confines the
color charges. We know from QCD that both phenomena generate dynamical mass scales.
In fact, this strong coupling phase is the non-abelian realization of the scenario put forward
by Bardeen, Leung and Love [24]. Their idea was that, while the Gc = U (1) gauge theory
with Nf massless fermions (QED) suffers of the zero charge problem or the triviality problem
related to the existence of a Landau pole, once the theory is deformed by the introduction
of four-fermion interactions, the resulting dynamics could develop a stable non-Gaussian
ultraviolet fixed point. These authors noted that such deformation leads to the emergence of
two physical phases. In one phase, the gauge coupling vanishes toward the infrared and chiral
symmetry remains intact. In the other phase, the gauge coupling grows toward the infrared
and chiral symmetry is dynamically broken. With a one-dimensional critical surface (defining
the line of physics), the flows out of the ultraviolet fixed point of our safe theory agree with
the ones envisioned by Bardeen, Leung and Love. In our template, QED is replaced by its
non-abelian version and the four-fermi interaction is replaced by the Yukawa coupling whose
scalar field is dynamical and self-interacts quartically. The safe template is theoretically more
manageable because, in the ‘t Hooft-Veneziano limit, the Yukawa and scalar couplings trigger
the ultraviolet fixed point to emerge and drive its position within a controllable, weak coupling
regime.
While safe QCD behaves in the infrared in a manner that mimics QCD, there are several
important differences. Firstly, the number of fermions (the size of the flavor group) is larger
than the critical value for which asymptotic freedom is lost in the asymptotically free QCD.
Secondly, in safe QCD, the fermions interact not only through gauge interactions but also
through scalar interactions. Thirdly, the safe QCD, the number of fermions are larger than
the critical number for the asymptotic freedom. Yet another, the scaling violations at short
distances are not of the Bjorken type (as in asymptotically free QCD) but of the KogutSusskind type.
Putting together, we claim that the strongly coupled region of safe QCD behaves as a nonabelian interacting plasma of massless fermions, scalars and gauge bosons in the ultraviolet
(where the coupling is perturbatively weak) and as a confined theory of hadrons with massive
11

This safe-QCD scenario is complementary to the scenario in which one adds novel matter and interactions
that modify the ultraviolet dynamics of QCD to allow for an interacting fixed point at short distances. This
last scenario was first proposed in [25] and then realised in [26–28].

Supersymmetric Safe Templates

Let us summarise the status of supersymmetric safe gauge theories. A safe theory (more
precisely a weakly safe theory in the classification of Section 2.2) out of the ultraviolet fixed
point can, in principle, flow to either a Gaussian infrared fixed point or to an interacting
infrared fixed point. Above in Section 2.1, we discussed the first type of the renormalization group flow because it is both theoretically and phenomenologically important to assess
whether non-asymptotically free theories can be ultraviolet complete, modulo the quantum
gravity. As it should be clear by now, we just provided an affirmative answer to gauge-Yukawa
theories that are remarkably similar in structure to the Standard Model in [17] 12 .
Generalising and improving previous results of [30], the general conditions that must be
(non-perturbatively) abided by non-asymptotically free supersymmetric theories to achieve
safety were put forward in [31]. At least one chiral superfield must achieve a large R charge
at the safe fixed point to ensure that the variation of the a-function between the safe and
gaussian fixed points is positive as better elucidated in [32]. Models of this type were shown
to exist in [30, 32, 33]. Another possible way to elude the constraints [31, 32] is to consider
ultraviolet fixed points flowing to IR interacting fixed points. Within perturbation theory
non-supersymmetric theories of this type were discovered in [34] and for supersymmetric
theories in [33, 35].
Summarising the status for supersymmetric safety, we can say that theories abiding the
constraints of [31] exist. Nevertheless specialising [31] to the case in which asymptotic freedom
is lost (Nf ≥ 3Nc ) for super QCD with(out) a meson [30, 31] one can show that these theories
are unsafe for any number of matter fields. This is in agreement with the 1/Nf studies of the
supersymmetric beta functions [30, 36, 36] as explained in [67]. The lack of safety of super
QCD with(out) a meson should be contrasted with QCD at large number of flavors for which
safety may be possible [38] and QCD with a meson for which safety is a fact [17].

Holography and Safe String Theory

A safe theory asymptotes in the ultraviolet to a conformal field theory defined by an interacting fixed point, so it is natural to expect a holographically dual string theory. In this
section, we shall work this out for the safe template of Section 2 in parallel to the N = 4
super Yang-Mills theory. The safe template of Section 2 was defined in the ‘t Hooft-Veneziano
limit. Specifically, the way we formulated the template was within the perturbative regime
of the Veneziano ratio , 0 <   1 such that the running couplings excurse within O().
According to the dictionary of the AdS/CFT correspondence, this would be in the regime
12

To establish the existence of the safe theory nonperturbatively, lattice simulation of the safe theory and
continuum limit at the ultraviolet fixed point are imperative. For the pioneering work in this direction, see
[29].

– 13 –

where the string theory dual to the template lives in a highly curved background (though it
asymptotically approaches the anti-de Sitter space). To effectively establish the safe gaugestring correspondence, we add to the safe template the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. We
argued previously that this theory constitutes the simplest safe theory (as the beta function
vanishes for any value of the coupling constant).
3.1

AdS/CFT Correspondence Revisited

We recall that the AdS/CFT correspondence is definable for theories with a well-defined
semiclassical limit. In the anti-de Sitter critical string theory, the limit is provided by weakly
interacting strings. In the conformal field theory, it is provided by the planar fishnet expansion
of Feynman diagrams. To pave our path toward the holography of safe gauge theories, we first
recall the rationale behind for the correspondence between critical string theory in AdS5 × S 5
space and four-dimensional N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. In the four-dimensional N = 4
super Yang-Mills theory, ‘t Hooft’s large Nc limit [19] reorganizes the gauge interactions in
power expansion of 1/Nc2 of punctured Feynman diagrams 13 . In the AdS5 × S 5 critical string
theory, the weak coupling limit organizes the string interaction in the genus expansion of the
punctured Riemann surfaces.
The four-dimensional N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory has an additional parameter; suitably rescaled, it is the ‘t Hooft coupling λ = g 2 N . Therefore, in the semiclassical limit, a
physical observable A(Nc , g 2 ) of the Yang-Mills theory is organized as


h=0

Here, h denotes the genus of Riemann surface formed by a fishnet of Feynman diagrams with
punctures specified by the Yang-Mills physical observables under consideration. The genus-h
contribution Ah sums up all Yang-Mills interactions at a fixed genus h, so it depends on the
‘t Hooft coupling λ. For a fixed value of λ, the Nc → ∞ limit is semiclassical, and so the
Yang-Mills topological expansion Eq.(3.1) is asymptotic with vanishing radius of convergence.
The ‘t Hooft coupling parameter λ takes an arbitrary non-negative fixed value, irrespective of the scale the dynamics is probed. So, the genus-h contribution Ah (λ) may be further
expanded. This allows one to define the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory in perturbation
expansions of both 1/Nc2 and λ. For physical observables, one obtains

At fixed genus h, the perturbation series in λ is known to be convergent with a finite radius

theory, the radius of converges is π.

In all known conformal field theories that admit a holographic dual, it still is either the ‘t Hooft loop
expansion parameter or the like.

topological expansion Eq.(3.3) is an asymptotic series with vanishing radius of convergence
[40].
The (dimensionless) curvature invariant 1/R2 takes an arbitrary non-negative fixed value,

The strong-weak duality is facilitated by the analyticity. As recalled above, the perturbative expansion of the genus-h Yang-Mills contribution Ah (λ) is convergent within a finite

analytic continuation in the complexified λ plane, the contribution Ah (λ) can be defined for
arbitrarily large value of λ. We see that the perturbative series Eq.(3.7) for the genus-h string
eh ought to be an asymptotic expansion around λ = ∞. The non-analyticity of
contribution A
square-root branch cut around λ = ∞ was first discovered for the Wilson loop observable in
[41–43], but it must occur for any physical observable. For Wilson loop observables, this was
checked via explicit Feynman diagram computations in references [44] and [45].
3.2

Safe String Theory I: Weak Coupling Phase

It should be possible to extend the AdS/CFT correspondence above to theories that contain
multiple parameters. This is what we need for the safe gauge theories described above as
they generically feature multiple coupling constants. Certainly, the safe template in Section
2 contained 6 parameters altogether; the number of colors Nc , the number of flavors Nf for a
given color, the Yukawa coupling y, the Higgs quartic couplings of single and double traces,
h and v, respectively. Both Nc and Nf can take arbitrarily large values, while the Higgs
couplings are constrained by the classical stability of the ground state. By the AdS/CFT
correspondence, our goal is to match the safe gauge theory defined at the ultraviolet fixed
point with a string theory in a background that involves the anti-de Sitter space. We will
do this by mimicking, as much as possible, the logical steps for the N = 4 super Yang-Mills
theory elucidated above.
If the holographic picture holds, the dual string theory must display a well-defined semiclassical limit, gst → 0. We must then also have a single parameter in the safe gauge theory
that facilitates the semiclassical limit. This immediately leads us to take the limit according to
which both Nc and Nf approach infinity in a manner that keeps the ratio Nf /Nc fixed. Only
in this limit we achieve an 1/Nc2 counting. This is nothing but the ’t Hooft-Veneziano limit
we studied in Section 2, which intertwine the gauge symmetry Gc with the flavor symmetry
Gf .
^1: To have a safe string theory dual, the flavor symmetry Gf of the fermion

and scalar fields is interlocked with the gauge symmetry Gc . This is facilitated by the
’t Hooft-Veneziano limit. There may still survive an Nc independent residual global
symmetry Gr in this limit.

Here, α denotes the collection of other defining parameters of the safe gauge theory beyond
Nc and Nf . For our safe template these are α = (αg , αy , αh , αv ) in Eq.(2.5) and  is the
Veneziano ratio defined in Eq.(2.6). For fixed  and α, the Nc → ∞ is a semiclassical limit,
so the safe topological expansion is an asymptotic series of vanishing radius of convergence.

As in the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, we may define the safe gauge theory as
perturbative series in  and α. Any safe physical observable can then be expressed via the

(3.9)
By the same reasoning as for the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, for a fixed genus h and
a fixed value of , the series expansion in each of the parameters α must have a finite radius
convergence. On the other hand, at a fixed genus h and a fixed value of α, the nature of the
series expansion in  is not known. If the series were asymptotic, the safe gauge theory would
contain two – not one – expansion parameters whose perturbative expansion is asymptotic.
Such a theory would not admit a string theory (which has just one semiclassical limit of
gst → 0) as its holographic dual.
The safe gauge theory presented in Section 2 nicely gets around this issue. Recall that
the safe template features the ultraviolet fixed point of the Banks-Zaks type, where the values
of the couplings α, at the non-Gaussian fixed point, are now functions of the Veneziano ratio
. We conclude that
^2: To have a safe string theory dual, the ratio Nf /Nc ought to be intertwined to
Safe
the values of the couplings α at the non-Gaussian fixed point.
The asymptotic symmetry of the safe gauge theory at the ultraviolet fixed point constrains
the structure of the multiple expansion Eq.(3.9). It includes the SO(4, 2) conformal symmetry
group and, if present, the Gr global symmetry group. The coupling parameters  and α are
all singlets under the SO(3, 1) Lorentz transformation and the Gr global transformation. If
the holography were to hold, there must be a massless scalar field dual to each of these
parameters. By the SO(4, 2) × Gr isometry, however, there is no such scalar field except the
warp factor of the anti-de Sitter space. This means that the safe gauge theory must have the
structure that all coupling parameters are proportional to one another near the ultraviolet
fixed point. In particular, if the fixed point is at a finite coupling value, the scalar interactions
should never hit the Landau pole. We thus have
^3: To have a safe string theory dual, the bulk scalar fields dual to the scalar
Safe
quartic couplings must asymptotically range over a finite value. This property may
hold without supersymmetry.
We already argued that the Veneziano ratio  must be proportional to the coupling
parameters, all through the renormalization group flow. This means that the critical surface
near the ultraviolet critical point is 1-dimensional.

– 17 –

^4: To have a safe string theory dual, the couplings must flow over a finite but
Safe
arbitrary interval set by the Veneziano ratio  and the safe theories need to feature a
one-dimensional ultraviolet critical surface.
We already claimed that the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory is the simplest safe gauge
theory, whose gauge coupling does not run with energy scale. Its string theory dual lives in
globally AdS5 ×S 5 spacetime, where the curvature invariant 1/R2 is the same everywhere. For
safe theories of the type presented in Section 2, the couplings run with the energy scale over a
range set by the Veneziano ratio . Accordingly, the string theory dual lives in asymptotically
AdS5 × X spacetime where the curvature invariant 1/R2 varies radially and asymptotes to a
constant value set by the ultraviolet fixed point. Therefore, we have that
^5: A holographic dual of the safe gauge theory is a string theory living in an
Safe
asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime whose curvature invariant 1/R2 varies along
the Liouville direction, forming a domain wall located at a critical scale. The infrared
physics is encapsulated inside the wall while the ultraviolet physics is mapped to the
region outside of the wall.
We now demonstrate this. We expect that the holographic dual of the safe template in
Section 2 is a 5-dimensional Type-0 non-critical string theory in the background of metric
gmn , dilaton φ of the NS-NS sector and volume-form G5 of the R-R sector, all in the string
frame [46]. The 4-dimensional Poincaré invariance puts the background to depend only on

Here, Rcr is a reference length scale, which we set equal to the inverse of the critical transition
scale 1/Λcr . We would like to see if a background (gmn , φ, G5 ) that encodes all the features
of the safe theory can be constructed15 .
The non-critical string theory of this sort was extensively studied in the context of holographic QCD [48, 49]. In 5-dimensional spacetime, the 5-form G5 is non-dynamical and its
first integral defines a conserved charge, which can be identified with the number of color Nc
of the safe gauge theory. As argued above, a physical observable is evaluated by derivative
expansion and the characteristic size is set by the reference length scale, ∂5d ' 1/Rcr . In this
14

The non-critical string theory lives in the 5-dimensional spacetime but it may also live in an internal
manifold X (of dimension less than 5) whose isometries encode the global symmetry Gr of the safe gauge
theory. Even in such situations, invariance under the spacetime Poincare and internal isometry transformations
is sufficient to put the background in this form.
15
A bottom-up approach of safe holography on a rigid AdS background was studied in [47].

expansion, the 5-form G5 is the field originating from the R-R sector and so it contributes in
powers of ||eφ G5 ||2 . In the ‘t Hooft limit gst Nc fixed, this is (gst Nc `st /Rcr )2 of order unity 16 ,
and so its contributions must be summed to all orders. A nontrivial dilaton potential would
be generated from the resummation, but determining ab initio its precise form is not feasible.
Therefore, as in [48, 49], we will assume that, after a resummation of the 5-form G5 contributions, the dynamics of the NS-NS sector is governed by a 5-dimensional dilaton gravity with
a nontrivial dilaton potential, whose dynamics is described by the effective action

The normalization factor W0 is arbitrary and can be absorbed by shifting the integration
domain; it should not affect physical observables. We can then obtain the profile of the
dilaton Φ(u) by solving for the first equation of Eq.(3.13) and finally obtain the profile of the
warp factor A(u) by substituting Φ(u) into the second equation of Eq.(3.13). The upshot is
that, given the beta function β(λ) of the safe gauge theory as an input, we can holographically
completely encode the renormalization group flow within the framework of Type-0 noncritical
string theory.
We now solve for these profiles and demonstrate that the dilaton Φ background forms
a domain-wall, interpolating between the two minima of V (Φ) representing the ultraviolet
and the infrared fixed points and that the dilaton approaches these fixed points with the
Kogut-Susskind power-law scaling. We start with the perturbative beta function of the safe
gauge theory, shown in the left of Figure 5
β(λ) = bλ(λ − λir )(λuv − λ)

(b > 0).

(3.16)

Here, for generality, we split the double zero at λ = 0 into two single zeros; physically, this can
be done by defining the safe gauge theory in a spacetime away from 4 dimensions [47, 58] or in
certain supersymmetric safe theories [33, 35]. For the safe template in Section 2, λuv = O()
and λir = 0. We will explore this template by taking the limit λir → 0 in the end.
One might be concerned with the truncation of the safe beta function at two loop order.
Moreover, the beta function is scheme-dependent starting from three loops. We claim that
the only physically relevant information is the existence of the fixed points as well as C 1
differentiability at the fixed points17 . Additionally the domain-wall is a topological configuration and so it is stable against any continuous deformation of parameters in the on-shell
dynamics.

 is scheme independent and converges rapidly [59].

λuv ) > λuv , we see that the Coleman-DeLuccia contribution |W |2 of the dynamical gravity
has the effect of lifting the otherwise degenerate extrema at λ = λuv , λir to V (λuv ) < V (λir ).

according to power-laws. This is in part because the dilaton flows between two extrema
of the potential and in part because the two extrema sit inside an infinite barrier. This
power-law behavior is the holographic realization of the Kogut-Susskind scaling.
This is in sharp contrast to the holographic dual of QCD or asymptotically free gauge theories.
In the latter cases, to encode the logarithmic behavior and so the Bjorken scaling, the dilaton
potential ought to be bottomless so that the dilaton Φ indefinitely runs away to −∞ 18

On the other hand, we will meet the similarity in the strong coupling phase in the next Section.
Note that the anomalous dimension is expressed in terms of g, not g 2 . This error [55] propagated boundlessly in holographic QCD literatures. This is not in contradiction with the fact that peturbation theory is in

Safe 6 in Section 2. We take this as convincing evidence for the existence of holographic duals
of safe theories. Though the data points of the safe gauge theory in Section 2 were limited to
weak coupling regime they can be extended to the non-perturbative regime for large ’t-HooftVeneziano parameter , additionally we stress that N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory (which is
the simplest safe gauge theory) 20 and varieties of interacting conformal field theories with
relevant flow to the infrared add data points for the non-perturbative regime. The geometry
of the holographic dual is an interpolating domain wall between two anti-de Sitter spaces of
different scalar curvature. The global anti-de Sitter space, dual to the N = 4 super Yang-Mills
theory, is the limit in which the domain wall flattens out. Additionally, varieties of known
conformal field theories with a built-in ‘t Hooft-Veneziano limit may provide additional (albeit
isolated) data points of non-perturbative safe gauge theories. We thus conjecture that
Conjecture: Safe Holography
A safe d-dimensional gauge theory that admit ‘t Hooft-Veneziano limits is holographically dual to a (d + 1)-dimensional safe noncritical string theory. The background of
the holographic dual is a gravitational domain-wall, interpolating between two asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces of different radius of curvature.

3.3

Safe String Theory II: Strong Coupling Phase

In Section 2.2, we argued that the safe template also has the strong coupling phase, which
we referred to as the safe QCD. Here we construct its holographic dual. We claim that the
dual is the safe noncritical string theory of Section 2.2, except that the on-shell background
of warp factor and dilaton field obey different boundary conditions. As the analysis is nearly
identical to Section 3.2, we shall be brief in details and focus on the relevant differences.
For the safe template of Section 2.1, the ultraviolet fixed point is located at αguv = O().
We still can make perturbative analysis reliably above (but not too far) the fixed point. Along
the strong coupling line of physics, the safe beta function is essentially the same as the beta
function of asymptotically free QCD. Therefore, in the deep infrared, the dilaton and warp
factor would grow indefinitely and the chiral symmetry breaking and the color confinement
should be probed via suitable physical observables.
What distinguishes the safe QCD from the asymptotically free QCD is the way the
ultraviolet fixed point is approached. While the asymptotically free dilaton potential runs
monotonic with no maximum anywhere near Φ ∼ −∞, the safe dilaton potential has a local
maximum and is well behaved everywhere. Many difficulties for constructing the holographic
QCD occurred because of the pathological profile with logarithmic runaway of the dilaton
field. The safe dilaton Φ starts off the ultraviolet fixed point and grows large. Close to the
20

That the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory in the ultraviolet can flow to less supersymmetric conformal field
theory in the infrared [56] furnishes further credibility to this viewpoint.

but with opposite sign of the model-specific parameters a. Such scaling makes the partons
in a safe gauge theory behave very differently from partons in an asymptotically free gauge
theory.
We claim that, as the dilaton and warp factor flow away from the u ∼ 0 asymptotic
anti-de Sitter space (the holographic dual of the ultraviolet fixed point), their profile would
evolve practically in the same way as holographic QCD. Intuitively, we can understand this
from the behavior of the perturbative beta function of the safe gauge theory. Recall that the
input for constructing the holographic dual background is the gauge theory beta function,
see Eq.(3.14). Up to two loops (which are renormalization scheme independent), the beta
function of the ‘t Hooft coupling λ is given in Eq.(3.16). See the left panel of Figure 4. Recall
that λir , λuv are infrared and ultraviolet fixed points of the ‘t Hooft gauge coupling λ, and
the safe template of Section 2.1 corresponds to the limit λir sent to 0. The safe theory in
the strong coupling phase is defined by taking λ slightly larger than λuv and approaching
it as the ultraviolet cutoff is removed. The running of the Safe QCD ‘t Hooft coupling, in
the strong coupling phase, mimics the one of the pure Yang-Mills theory or ordinary QCD
with sufficiently small number of fermions. We can see this by shifting the ‘t Hooft coupling
constant as λ = λuv + λ̂, where λ̂ is a positive definite, shifted coupling constant. The safe
beta function is then reduced to
β(λ̂) ≡

dλ̂(µ)
= −bo λ̂ − b1 λ̂2 − b2 λ̂3 ,
d log µ

(3.28)

where (with overall minus sign pulled out) the coefficients
b0 = bλuv (λuv − λir ),

b1 = b(2λuv − λir ),

b2 = b

(3.29)

are all positive. The signs of the beta function coefficients match the ones of the pure YangMills theory or QCD with sufficiently small number of fermions 21 .
As the beta functions of respectively safe and asymptotically free QCD are similar at
low energies it is natural to expect that the gauge-string correspondence of both QCDs is
also similar in so far as the infrared dynamics is concerned; as much as we have the chiral
symmetry breaking and the confinement in asymptotically free QCD, so do we in safe QCD.

Further Discussions

In this paper, we developed a program that aims at establishing a correspondence between
safe quantum field theories and safe string theories. In order to achieve this safe gauge-string
correspondence we started with introducing a safe template made by a gauge-Yukawa theory
featuring fermion matter and scalar fields. We then argued for the existence of a (d + 1)dimensional safe noncritical string theory dual for a given d-dimensional safe gauge theory
admitting the ’t Hooft-Veneziano limit. The string theory dual leaves on an asymptotically
anti-de Sitter space with nontrivial dilaton and warp factor flows. The safe gauge theory
template leads to two infrared phases, one flowing to weak coupling and another to strong
coupling, respectively. This feature is shared by a wider class of safe quantum field theories.
We study the holographic dual for both phases. We further argued that the strong coupling
phase, that we dubbed safe QCD, possesses a holographic dual that is better controlled than
the one for ordinary asymptotically free QCD.
We pointed out evidences that the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory and associated
AdS/CFT correspondence are a limit situation of the safe gauge theories and their safe gaugestring correspondence; flow of the ‘t Hooft coupling is frozen to the value at the ultraviolet
fixed point. We emphasized their importance in the space of safe quantum field theories, as
the theory along its line of fixed points provide data points of strongly coupled safe theories
that are solvable through the AdS/CFT correspondence. We also mention that our argument
is not limited to N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory and all known conformal field theories of
varying degrees of supersymmetry and spacetime dimensions are a limit situation of the safe
gauge theories. We emphasize that this interpretation is irrespective of whether the conformal
field theory is isolated or equipped with a conformal manifold.
We emphasized that safe theories greatly expand the space of quantum field theories.
The development is in its infancy and so it would be helpful to corner the theory into various
analytically controllable regimes. Two corners merit special mention.
• The first example concerns a large flavor charge limit of the safe template [60]. In this
limit, the flavor symmetry is spontaneously broken; the symmetry breaking pattern
and the spectroscopy of ground state energy were understood. At low energy, the
theory features a decoupled confining Yang–Mills theory and a characteristic spectrum
of type I (relativistic) and type II (non-relativistic) Goldstone bosons. The knowledge
of the spectrum in the broken phase and the perturbative analysis at the safe fixed
point allowed to establish scaling dimensions of operators in the broken phase as a triple
expansion in the inverse of the charge, the inverse of Nf and the gauge coupling constant
at the ultraviolet fixed point. The results further unveiled a number of noteworthy
properties of the low-energy spectrum, vacuum energy and conformal properties of the
theory, including the derivation of a new consistency condition for the relative sizes of
the couplings at the fixed point. This method is amenable to generalizations to other
safe templates.

– 26 –

• The second example regards the relevant complementary limit of finite Nc and large
Nf for gauge-fermion theories. We recall that these theories (such as QCD) cannot be
perturbatively safe when Nf is just above the critical value associated to the loss of
asymptotic freedom [61]. The beta function at leading order in the 1/Nf expansion
was computed and investigated in [62–65]. To this order one observes tantalising hints
of the existence of an interacting ultraviolet fixed point [38, 62, 63]. Related physical
properties, including the scaling dimensions near the leading 1/Nf fixed point, were
studied in Ref. [17] from which one can derive the glueball anomalous dimension [66].
However, because the fixed point occurs by a delicate cancellation that might not be
supported in the full theory it is crucial to study the analytic properties of the theory
[67] as well as sub-leading corrections in 1/Nf2 . At large but finite Nf lattice simulations
are the only way to address the ultraviolet dynamics of these theories. Pioneering lattice
simulations for SU(2) gauge theories with 24 and 48 Dirac fermions in the fundamental
representation were performed in [29] while earlier studied appeared in [68]. These
lattice simulations constitute also the stepping stone towards analyzing the safe template
dynamics used for non-perturbative values of the Veneziano parameter . This will
allow, de facto, to test the safe gauge-string correspondence which is notoriously hard
to do in the supersymmetric case because the lattice regularization explicitly breaks
supersymmetry.
These developments are interesting also in view of our work. The large charge limit, for
example, offers an exciting playground for developing the associated holographic dual within
our proposed safe gauge-string correspondence. Further, the finite number of colors and large
number of matter fields limit helps shaping the boundary of the safe quantum field theories
that can be further explored via holography [69].
Our template’s renormalization group fixed point structure and phases thereof are general
enough that our safe holographic constructions should work for other safe quantum field
theories. Many of these safe theories might not be all gauge theories but still possess a largeNf limit of flavor or global symmetries. It would be interesting to study them in the future
as well.
