In this paper we study the increment of the entanglement entropy and of the (replica)
logarithmic negativity in a zero-density excited state of a free massive bosonic theory, compared
to the ground state. This extends the work of two previous publications by the same authors.
We consider the case of two disconnected regions and find that the change in the entanglement
entropy depends only on the combined size of the regions and is independent of their connectivity.
We subsequently generalize this result to any number of disconnected regions. For the replica
negativity we find that its increment is a polynomial with integer coefficients depending only on
the sizes of the two regions. The logarithmic negativity turns out to have a more complicated
functional structure than its replica version, typically involving roots of polynomials on the
sizes of the regions. We obtain our results by two methods already employed in previous work:
from a qubit picture and by computing four-point functions of branch point twist fields in finite
volume. We test our results against numerical simulations on a harmonic chain and find excellent
agreement.

Introduction

In recent years there has been much progress in the understanding of entanglement measures in
one-dimensional many body quantum systems (see e.g. the review articles in [1, 2, 3]). These
include critical systems, such as conformal field theories (CFTs) and critical quantum spin
chains [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], as well as gapped systems such as massive quantum field theories (QFTs)
(integrable or not) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], gapped quantum spin chains [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23] and lattice models [24, 25, 26]. Much of this work has focussed on one particular measure
of entanglement, the entanglement entropy [27] and on a particular state, the ground state.
More recently, the entanglement of different classes of excited states [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33], as
measured by the entanglement entropy and other measures of entanglement [34, 35, 36, 37, 39],
has been studied.
In two recent works [32, 33] we have investigated the entanglement entropy of gapped systems in zero-density excited states, where excitations have a (quasi-)particle interpretation. We
found a very intuitive mathematical structure
for the entropy differences between the ground
state and such excited states. This structure
allowed for simple closed formulae in particular
limits. At the basis of our results laid the observation that the additional entanglement entropy
due to such excitations is equal to the entanglement entropy of very simple states, involving a
small number of qubits with amplitudes which

represent the probabilities of finding particles in

various system’s regions. This idea of localized
excitations and their one-to-one correspondence
with increased entanglement has turned out to
be surprisingly general. So far it has been shown to work for systems without interactions and
in some instances of interacting models and particular excited states. We also found numerical
evidence of the validity of our results for the harmonic chain and lattice (2 dimensions) and
beyond the universal quantum field theory regime. In the present work we extend this intuition,
with precise results for the free boson theory, to the entanglement entropy of disconnected regions and the (replica) logarithmic negativity. In one dimension, the configuration that we will
be considering throughout this manuscript is illustrated by Fig. 1. Here L is the full length
of the system and `1 , `3 are the lengths of subsystems A and B respectively. The length of
subsystem C is then L ´ `1 ´ `3 , which includes the mid-region of length `2 .
The von Neumann and Rényi entanglement entropies are measures of the amount of quantum
entanglement, in a pure quantum state, between the degrees of freedom associated to two sets
of independent observables whose union is complete on the Hilbert space. For a subsystem
consisting of two disconnected regions as in Fig. 1, the Hilbert space may be seen as having the
structure

Consider a bipartition where the two sets of observables correspond to the local observables in
Ť
the two finite-size complementary regions, A B and C. Let the system be in a state |ΨyL . Then
Ť
the von Neumann entropy associated to region A B is
S1Ψ p`1 , `3 , Lq “ ´TrAŤB pρAŤB log ρAŤB q ,

(1.2)

where ρAŤB “ TrC p|ΨyLL xΨ|q is the reduced density matrix associated to subsystem A B. One
may obtain the von Neumann entropy S1Ψ p`1 , `3 , Lq as a limiting case of the sequence of nth
Rényi entropies defined as

The logarithmic negativity of the same state |ΨyL [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45] is defined as:

E Ψ “ log TrAŤB ˇρTABŤB ˇ .

(1.5)

The geometry is the same as in Fig. 1 but the density matrix ρTABŤB differs from ρAŤB , thanks to
the operation TB , which represents partial transposition on subsystem B. Crucially, after such
transposition, the matrix ρTABŤB is no longer guaranteed to be positive-definite: specifically, it
may have positive and negative eigenvalues. The operation TrAŤB | ¨ | involved in (1.5) represents
the “trace norm” of ρTABŤB , namely the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues.
Similarly as for the von Neumann entropy, it is possible to define the logarithmic negativity
as a limit of a more general set of quantities depending on an additional parameter n as:
´
¯n
EnΨ p`1 , `3 , Lq :“ log TrAŤB ρTABŤB
.
(1.6)
such that
E Ψ p`1 , `3 , Lq :“ lim EnΨ p`1 , `3 , Lq,

(1.7)

The meaning of the last equation is that one sets n “ 2m for m P N, and then analytically
continues in m towards m “ 1{2 (under appropriate conditions in the complex m plane making
this analytic continuation unique). This definition was first proposed in [36, 37]. From now on
we will call these functions replica logarithmic negativities.
Note that the (replica) logarithmic negativity is a measure of the entanglement between the
non-complementary regions A and B whereas the von Neumann and Rényi entropies defined
Ť
earlier are measures of the entanglement between the two complementary regions A B and C.
Therefore they are distinct measures capturing different information about the state.
From the definitions above it is clear that in order to compute these measures of entanglement
we need to have access to the reduced density matrix ρAŤB and its partially transposed version,
or at least to their eigenvalues. This may be achieved numerically for some systems, but if
the system admits a quantum field theory description, then is also accessible analytically by
relating the nth powers ρnAŤB and pρTABŤB qn to specific correlators of local fields in quantum field
theory [8, 9, 12]. In [12] these fields were termed branch point twist fields and characterized as
2

symmetry fields in an n-copy version of the model under study. Branch point twist fields have
since been systematically employed in the computation of measures of entanglement in massive
QFTs and also in CFT. The entanglement measures considered in this paper, in the setup of
Fig. 1, were studied systematically in the ground state of CFT in [34, 35, 36, 37, 46] and also
partially in massive integrable QFT [47, 48].
In the present work we want to extend our study to zero-density excited states. More
precisely, we want to study the increment of the entanglement entropies of two disconnected
regions and of the replica logarithmic negativities in a zero-density excited state, compared to
the ground state. We define the new variables,
ri :“

`i
,
L

for i “ 1, 2, 3,

and r :“ 1 ´ r1 ´ r3 .

(1.8)

In this paper we will consider the scaling limit, defined as
L, `1 , `2 , `3 Ñ 8 ,

with

r, r1 , r2 , r3

finite,

and

0 ď r, r1 , r2 , r3 ď 1 .

(1.9)

In terms of branch point twist field correlators, the increment of the Rényi entropies of two
disconnected regions is given by:

where Sn0 pr1 , r3 q are the entropies in the ground state. As the notation suggests, we will see
later that ∆SnΨ prq is a function of r only. The increments of the replica logarithmic negativities
are given by:

and are functions of r1 and r3 only. As standard, T is the branch point twist field, T̃ is its
hermitian conjugate and |0yL is the ground state in the compactified space of Fig. 1. As is wellknown [12] the branch point twist fields are symmetry fields associated with cyclic permutation
symmetry in an n-copy version of the theory under consideration. From this definition it follows
that T “ T̃ if n “ 2, and we will see later that, indeed, the results for the replica logarithmic
negativity equal those for the Rényi entropy (up to a sign) for n “ 2.
When employing the branch point twist field technique, we will therefore be computing ratios
of four-point functions in the infinite volume limit. Exact explicit formulae for the four-point
functions above are generally inaccessible even in the ground state and/or CFT. Remarkably
though, the increments computed here, in this particular scaling limit, turn out to be the
logarithms of order k ˆ n polynomials (where k is the number of excitations) in the parameters
r1 , r3 (or just in r for the entanglement entropy) with positive, integer coefficients.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we summarize the main results of the paper.
In section 3 we show how these results may be obtained from a qubit interpretation. That is,
we show that the formulae for the increment of entropies (negativities) in excited states of QFT
equal the entropies (negativities) of a very special class of states involving a finite number of
qubits. In section 4 we obtain the same results from a branch point twist field computation in the
massive free boson theory. In section 5 we present some numerical results for the harmonic chain.
We conclude in section 6. In Appendix A we summarize some formulae for the Rényi entropies
and replica negativities for particular values of n and k. In Appendix B we derive the logarithmic
negativities of states of two and three identical excitations from the exact diagonalization of the
reduced and partially transposed density matrix. In Appendix C we extend our qubit results
for the Rényi entropies of two disconnected regions to the case of any number of disconnected
regions. In Appendix D we summarize some useful results for the residua of certain types of
first, second and third order poles which play a role in our branch point twist field computation.

Summary of the Main Results

Consider a state consisting of a single particle excitation. Let us denote the entropy increments
of such a state by ∆Sn1 prq with r as defined earlier (1.8). We find that
∆Sn1 prq “

logprn ` p1 ´ rqn q
.
1´n

(2.1)

This is identical to the result found in [32, 33] for a connected region of length r and indeed,
further results for the von Neumann and other types of entropy, for excited states consisting of a
higher number of excitations, identical or not, also take the same form as found in [32, 33]. We
will not report all of these here again. We report however the formula for a k-particle excited
state consisting of identical excitations, as it will feature later on. This is given by

This means that the entanglement entropy increase due to the presence of a discrete number
of excitations depends only upon the size of the regions A and B relative to that of the whole
system, and not on their connectivity. Indeed, in Appendix C we show that the same conclusion
can be drawn for a subsystem consisting of any number of disconnected regions.
Results are more interesting for the (replica) logarithmic negativity. First, we find that it
is a function of r1 , r3 , where each parameter now enters independently. For a state consisting
of a single particle excitation the increment of the replica logarithmic negativity is given by the
simple expression:

For a state consisting of k distinct excitations (particles with distinct momenta), the result is
simply k times the above, just as for the Rényi entropies. The case of identical excitations

of p and q. As should be, formula (2.3) is the k “ 1 case of (2.6). Indeed the coefficients inside
the sum (2.3) are nothing but the number of partitions of p into n parts, p of which are 1 and
n ´ p of which are 0, with the constraint that there are no consecutive 1s.
Since the coefficients Ap,q are rather non-trivial, it is not easy to perform the sums in (2.6)
explicitly and the analytic continuation leading to the logarithmic negativity is rather involved.

Note that the functions (2.5), (2.8) give nice simple illustrations of the non-trivial nature of
the analytic continuation from n even to n “ 1. Although for integer n the functions (2.3) and
(2.6) are simple polynomials in r1 , r3 , the logarithmic negativity involves roots which appear
to be of increasing order as k is increased. As explained in Appendix B, we have obtained the
analytic continuation of (2.6), for k “ 2 giving (2.8) and for k “ 3 giving (B.34), by explicitly
computing the eigenvalues of the partially transposed reduced density matrix obtained from a
qubit interpretation.
The marked difference between functions (2.5), (2.8) and (2.3), (2.6) can also be seen in
Figs. 2 and 3 where they are shown to exhibit opposite sign and curvature. The gradual change
in curvature as n is reduced is particularly clear from the cross-section views given in Fig. 4.
The expression (2.6) with (2.7) suggests a combinatorial interpretation for our results and
indeed such interpretation can be made concrete. A one-to-one relationship between (2.6) and
the generating function of the number of simply-connected graphs with 2nk nodes, nk edges
and certain connectivity conditions will be proven in [38].
Let us for now present two approaches whereby these results can be derived: from an interpretation in terms of qubits, and from a direct calculation within massive QFT.

Qubit Interpretation

It was shown in [32, 33] that exact expressions for the increment of entanglement entropy in a
zero-density excited state and a bipartition involving only simply-connected domains could be
derived from a so-called “qubit interpretation”. This interpretation was first suggested by the
result (2.1) and the realization
that it is identical to the Rényi entropy of a two-qubit state of the
?
?
form |Ψqb y “ r|01y ` 1 ´ r|10y: the entanglement entropy increase depends only on whether
Ť
the particle is localized in region A B with probability r, or on region C, with probability
1 ´ r. The strength of this picture lays on the fact that it can be extended naturally to states
consisting of multiple excitations. Their increase of entanglement entropy is also the entropy of
multi-qubit states, with coefficients which also have a simple probabilistic interpretation. For
a single connected region, this interpretation has been numerically shown to hold even in the
two-dimensional harmonic lattice [33].
This interpretation worked so well for the entanglement entropy of simply-connected domains
and appears so natural that one may expect it to still hold for disconnected regions and for the
logarithmic negativity. Clearly, it suggests that results should be independent of the topology
of the regions. This is in agreement with our first main formula (2.1) (and its multiple-particle
generalisation) and holds as well in the case of a region composed of any number of disconnected
parts (see Appendix C). As we see below, this interpretation also allows us to obtain the result
(2.6) for the the replica logarithmic negativities.

3.1

Single Particle Excitation

Let us consider the simplest case, that of an excited state of a single excitation. We can simply
write the following three qubit state:

r|010y ` r3 |001y .

(3.1)

where the first qubit represents the presence (1) or not (0) of a particle in region A, the second
qubit represents the same for region C, and the final qubit likewise for region B. Tracing over
the mid-qubit we have that

Interestingly, for n integer, even or odd, there is no square-root dependence of the polynomial
above (the square-roots always cancel). Indeed, it can be equivalently written as given in (2.3).
However, the logarithmic negativity itself involves the square root in (3.8). From the eigenvalues

different functions. However, it is easy to show that the polynomials inside the logarithm coincide
for n “ 2.

3.2

Multiple Particle Excitations

The approach developed above, where we compute the eigenvalues of the reduced (partially
transposed) density matrix, has been applied also to the cases of two and three identical excitations, leading to the results (2.8) and (B.34). The explicit computation is reported in Appendix
B. For higher number of excitations, this exact diagonalization approach becomes quickly intractable. Here, we instead present an approach based on evaluating the replica trace more
generally. It directly leads to the results (2.1) and (2.6). However, in the latter case, we do not
know in general how to extract the analytic continuation to n “ 1 from even values, necessary
for the logarithmic negativity.
3.2.1

Distinct Excitations

Having considered the particular case above, it is worth noting that the qubit states associated
with multiple distinct excitations are by construction factorized states. For instance for two

where the first two qubits live in region A, the next two in region C and the final two in region

(3.11)

From this factorization it is easy to see that both the Rényi entropies and the logarithmic
negativity will be twice their value for a single excitation. This generalizes to k-particle states
consisting of distinct excitations.
3.2.2

Identical Excitations

Consider instead a k-particle state consisting of k identical excitations. Its associated qubit
state can be written as:
ÿ
pkq
|Ψqb y “
ck1 ,k2 ,k3 |k1 k2 k3 y ,
(3.12)
tk1 ,k2 ,k3 uPσ03 pkq

where σ03 pkq represents the set of integer partitions of k into three non-negative parts,
d
k!r1k1 rk2 r3k3
ck1 ,k2 ,k3 :“
δk `k `k ,k ,
k1 !k2 !k3 ! 1 2 3

(3.13)

and we recall once more the definitions (1.8).
The state may be interpreted as follows: each state |k1 k2 k3 y is a state of k1 excitations
in region A, k2 excitations in region C and k3 excitations in region B. The square of the
corresponding coefficient c2k1 ,k2 ,k3 is the associated probability that this configuration occurs if
we were to place randomly and independently, with uniform distribution, k particles on the
interval r0, 1s covered by three non-intersecting subintervals of lengths r1 , r and r3 .
pkq
Provided that all vectors |k1 k2 k3 y are normalized to one, then the vector |Ψqb y is also a unit
vector,

(3.14)

From this expression it is then possible to explicitly construct the reduced density matrix and
its partially transposed version as:

xk1 k3 |ρAŤB |k11 k31 y “

ck1 k2 k31 ck11 k2 k3 .

(3.16)

Here the sums run over all non-negative integers, and whenever the constraint k1 ` k2 ` k3 “ k
is violated, the corresponding coefficient ck1 ,k2 ,k3 is zero by definition. From this constraint we
know in fact that 0 ď k2 ď k so we could have restricted the summation range k2 P N0 much
more. However we will write it like this for now, for simplicity, and discuss the summation
ranges more precisely at the end of our calculation. With these results we can now evaluate the
matrix elements of the n-th powers of the reduced density matrices above. These are given by:

Results for Rényi Entropies

We can now eliminate the delta-functions by implementing their constraints. Let us start with
the Rényi entropies. We can substitute:
k1j “ k ´ k2j´1 ´ k3j ,

@j ,

(3.23)

and this will eliminate the sums over k1j with j “ 1, . . . , n. We then have sums over k2j and k3j
left but we can also eliminate one of these by implementing the second set of delta-functions
together with the conditions above. This gives the constraints,

and σ0n pqq represents the set of integer partitions of q into n non-negative parts. We have
relabelled k3j :“ kj , and the range of the sums in p and q is determined by the condition of
Zp,q ‰ 0. From the definition (3.24), 0 ď p ď k. Regarding the values of q, we know that q can
not be negative (by definition) so q ě 0. Its maximum value is obtained if k ´ p ´ kj “ 0 for all
j. This corresponds to q “ npk ´ pq. In fact the sum over q can be rewritten as

as reported in (2.2). Therefore, the entanglement entropy depends only on the parameter r and
is given by exactly the same expression as found in [32, 33]. In other words, in the qubit picture,
the entanglement entropy depends only on the overall size of regions and not on whether or
not they are connected. This implies that the same result should also hold for more than two
disconnected regions. Indeed this can be shown by similar methods. The proof is presented in
Appendix C.
3.2.4

Results for Replica Logarithmic Negativity

A similar analysis can be carried out for the replica logarithmic negativity. Starting with (3.22)
the second delta function gives the condition:
k1j “ k ´ k2j´1 ´ k3j´1 ,

@j ,

(3.30)

and this eliminates the sums over k1j with j “ 1, . . . , n. We then have sums over k2j and k3j
left but we can also eliminate one of these by implementing the second set of delta-functions
together with the conditions above. This gives the constraints,
k2j ´ k2j´1 “ k3j´1 ´ k3j`1 ,
12

@j .

(3.31)

We may regard this equation as a first order difference equation for the sequence k2j . The solution
to such an equation is the sum of the solution to its homogenous version (a constant) and a
particular solution of the full equation which can be worked out by inspection to be ´k3j ´ k3j`1 .
The general solution is then
k2j “ γ ´ k3j ´ k3j´1 ,
(3.32)
where γ is an arbitrary constant. With this we also have that k1j “ k ´ γ ` k3j . We can now
evaluate the product

as given in (2.6) and (2.7). The range of sums in p and q is fixed by selecting out those contributions for which Ap,q ‰ 0. This requires that the arguments of the factorials in the denominator
remain non-negative, which in turn restricts the type of partitions that can contribute to the
sum over k1 , . . . , kn .
Consider the sum in p. The range of this sum can be determined easily from the relation
(3.32). This implies that 0 ď γ ď 2k. Together with the definition of p this gives ´k ď p ď k.
This guarantees that all arguments of the factorials in the denominator remain non-negative.
The range of values of q can also be determined as follows. The lower limit is easy to
establish as whenever p ă 0 the partitions contributing to Ap,q must have kj ě ´p. Thus, the
smallest value of q giving a non-vanishing contribution corresponds to taking all kj “ ´p for
all j which gives q “ ´np. On the other hand, if p ě 0 then the smallest value q can take
is zero corresponding to all kj “ 0. This fixes the lower bound to maxp0, ´npq. Let us now
consider the upper bound. Given a certain p, the largest value q can take corresponds to having
k ´ p ´ kj ´ kj`1 “ 0 for all j, or kj ` kj`1 “ k ´ p. Writing

Computation from Branch Point Twist Fields

In this section we evaluate the leading volume contribution to the increment of Rényi entropies
of two disconnected regions and the increment of the replica logarithmic negativity using branch
point twist field methods in the free massive boson theory. This provides a formal derivation,
from QFT methods, of the results presented in the previous sections, which were argued for
based on the qubit picture. We follow the same strategy as for the computation presented
in [33], generalized to the study of the four-point functions entering the definitions (1.10) and
(1.11). All the techniques that we use in this section (branch point twist fields, finite volume
form factors, doubling trick) have been exhaustively reviewed in [33] and we refer the reader
to this paper for further details. Here we will just enumerate the main ideas and techniques
needed.

4.1

Techniques and Main Formulae

As usual in the context of branch point twist fields we will be working with a replica free boson
theory, consisting of n copies of the original model. We then first implement the doubling trick
[49] on the replica free boson theory to construct a replica free massive complex boson theory.
The doubling introduces a new U p1q internal symmetry on each replica. This makes it possible
to diagonalize the action of the branch point twist fields on asymptotic states. Associated to
these new U p1q symmetries there are n twist fields Tp with p “ 1, . . . , n in terms of which the
branch point twist field can be expressed as:
T “

n
ź

Tp ,

(4.1)

p“1

where p labels the U p1q sectors. The form factors of the U p1q twist fields will constitute the
building blocks of all our computations so we will recall the main formulae here. They can be
computed by the standard techniques [50, 51, 52] and have been known for a long time [53, 54].
The formulae that we will need here are:

p x0|Tp |0yp

p

πp ep n ´ 2 qθ12
“ ´ sin

n cosh θ212

(4.2)

where θ12 :“ θ1 ´θ2 . This is the normalized (by the vacuum expectation value) matrix element of
a sector-p U p1q twist field between the vacuum in that sector and a two-particle state. The state
consists of a complex free boson (with creation operator a:p pθ1 q and rapidity θ1 ) and its chargeconjugate boson (with creation operator b:p pθ2 q and rapidity θ2 ). The dependence on the sector
is determined by the form factor equations, in particular the crossing relation fpn pθ ` 2πiq “
2πip

e n fpn pθq. Since the theory is free, higher particle form factors can be obtained by simply
employing Wick’s theorem. For the complex free boson they have the structure
F p,n pθ1 , . . . , θm ; β1 , . . . , βm q :“

fpn pθσp1q ´ β1 q ¨ ¨ ¨ fpn pθσpmq ´ βm q ,

(4.3)

where σ are all elements of the permutation group Sm of m symbols and each two-particle
form factor can be associated with a particle-antiparticle contraction. Note that any other form
factors are zero (e.g. if the numbers of particles and antiparticles are different).
The second important ingredient in our calculation is understanding the structure of the
Hilbert space of the theory in the replica doubled theory. That is, the description of the asymptotic states in each sector of the theory in a basis upon which the U p1q twist fields act diagonally.
The solution to this problem was discussed at length in [33] and can be schematically presented
as follows. First,
1

a:j pθq ÞÑ ? ppa`
q: pθq ` pa´
j “ 1, . . . , n
(4.4)
j q pθqq,
2 j
that is, the creation operator of a real boson on copy j is mapped after doubling into a linear
combination of creation operators on copy j associated with a complex free boson (+) and its
charge conjugate (-). As expected, the branch point twist field action on these operators is such
that they are mapped to operators on copy j ` 1 of the theory. However, there exists a new
basis ta:p pθq, b:p pθqu with p “ 1, . . . , n on which the branch point twist field acts diagonally, with
each U p1q field (4.1) acting on a particular sector. For example, in can be shown
n
1 ÿ ´ 2πijp :
:
?
e n ap pθq ,
pa`
q
pθq
“
j
n p“1

(4.5)

where the operators a:p pθq, b:p pθq satisfy also a complex boson algebra. We will from now on
perform computations on this basis, where we can employ the matrix elements of U p1q twist
fields seen above. Although this simplifies the computation of form factors enormously, the price
to pay is a more complicated structure for the excited states which must now be also expressed
in this new basis (see e.g. (4.16) for an example).
The third and final issue to consider is the finite volume extension of the above. In particular,
rapidities will be quantized in finite volume and the quantization conditions will depend upon
the sector p the corresponding creation/anhilation operator is acting on, and upon an index α
that parametrizes the periodicity conditions for the fields Φj px ` Lq “ Φj`α pxq, where Φj pxq
is the complex bosonic field with associated creation operators in (4.4). A set of (generalized)
Bethe-Yang equations [55, 56] can be written as

The branch point twist fields intertwine between the different quantization sectors. Denoting
the corresponding Hilbert space by Hα we can write
T : Hα Ñ Hα´1 ,

T̃ : Hα Ñ Hα`1 .

(4.10)

The excited states |ΨyL we consider in this calculation are elements of the trivial quantization
sector H0 ” Hn . This, combined with the properties of the branch point twist fields means that
the four point functions of interest may be spanned as
L xΨ| T

where x1,2,3 denote the positions of the branch point twist fields which is related to the original
lengths in Fig. 1 as
x1 :“ `1 ,

x2 :“ `1 ` `2 ,

and x3 :“ `1 ` `2 ` `3 .

(4.13)

Employing (4.1) the four-point functions then factorize into products of contributions from every
sector, involving the finite volume matrix elements of U p1q twist fields. These matrix elements
are related to infinite volume form factors (4.3) in a simple well-known fashion [57, 58] which
involves dividing each infinite volume form factor by the square root of the product of the
associated particle energies (in general, for interacting theories, this would be the density of
states) of the excitations involved, and employing the crossing property of form factors. This

The strategy of the calculation from this point on is to evaluate the matrix elements of the
twist fields using the finite volume form factor formula (4.14), turn the summation for quantum
numbers into contour integrals, and by contour manipulation extract the leading volume contribution. First, we focus on the increment of the Rényi entropy of two disconnected regions. We
will later see that the logarithmic negativity can be computed in a very similar way.

Entanglement Entropy of two Disconnected Regions

Let us compute the ratio of correlators (1.10) for a single-particle excited state. We need to
evaluate (4.19) with (4.21). We will start by focussing on the evaluation of (4.21) through the
introduction of the complete sums Ip0 and Ip1 . We first introduce some notations. We denote
the rapidities of the complete sets of states, starting from left to right, by βi , αi , β̃i and their
numbers by m , k  , m̃ , respectively. As usual  “ ˘. The rapidities satisfy the following BetheYang quantization conditions (4.6)

where P pθq “ m sinh θ are the particle momenta. We have also used the symmetry property
of the form factors (since we are dealing with free bosons, the form factors are symmetric in
all rapidities). We stress that at this stage all the rapidities in the formula are solutions of
the appropriate Bethe-Yang equations. This will not be the case anymore when we rewrite our
formulae in terms of contour integrals. We will start by transforming the tβ  u set by writing

where we now consider the function hp,

that the integrand has a pole exactly when the Bethe-Yang equation is satisfied. The function

We deform the contour into a contour encircling the real axis with positive orientation CÔ and
subtract the residua of the form factors’ kinematic poles. The form factors (4.3) have kinematic
poles, when either βi “ θ in the first form factor or βi “ αj for some j, in the second form
factor. However, if the quantum number Ij “ I 0 , the quantum number of the excited state, then
αj “ θ and a second order pole can result from the combination of the kinematic singularities
of the two form factors. This leads to a different residue, hence we should proceed with care.
In order to correctly account for the different contributions, we separate the quantum number
sums into a group that coincide with I 0 and the rest

We can expand the integration multi-contour by substituting (4.32) into (4.33) and employing

which is the subset of tα uk , itself being involved in a particular term of the expansion (4.31).
The nonnegative integer summation indices are constrained by
m “ mÔ ` mθ ` mα ,

(4.35)

Note that although, in general, the order in which the integrals over the various contours are
performed matters, in the expansion (4.34) we can obviate this by employing the fact that
all such orderings are equivalent under relabeling of rapidities and that in this case all such
relabelings are equivalent due to the symmetries of the free boson form factors.
Let us focus on the residua of the contour Cθ (that is the poles with βi “ θ). As mentioned
before, if M  ‰ 0, the product of the two first form factors produces both second and first oder
poles. We denote by mθ,1{2 the number of first order poles arising from the first/second form
factor, and by mθ,d the number of second order poles. They satisfy the condition
mθ “ mθ,1 ` mθ,2 ` mθ,d .

(4.36)

Evaluating the residua of these poles produces several types of factors. In the phase factors,
the rapidity is trivially replaced by θ or γi (recall that the rapidities tγ  umα are a subset of
tα uk as defined in (4.34)). There are constant factors coming from the combination of the
form factor residua and the denominators, simplified by using the Bethe-Yang equations (4.24)
and (4.25). These factors contain derivatives in the case of higher order poles. Moreover, in case
of first order poles, the contracted rapidity θ or γj appears in the non-singular form factor. In
the case of Cθ , this also means taking the regular part of that form factor, defined as the part
that does not contain any two-particle form factors depending on βi ´ θ. The singular terms
thus omitted are already accounted for in the double order pole residua. The form factors minus
such omitted terms are what we later denote by an additional subscript “reg” (see Eq. (4.43)).
There are combinatorial factors coming from counting all possible contractions of βi with θ or γj
rapidities inside a given form factor, that we discuss in detail later. The residua of the singular
two-particle form factor(s) are given by

the number of second order poles. The residua of the singular two-particle form factor(s) are

not included in the original contour. That is

(4.51)

It is important to note that C˜Ô must be chosen such as to run closer to the real axis than the

at this point. Since any given αij
can have first, second, and third order poles. Using the residue formulae in Appendix D, it is
clear that only third order poles can generate contributions that are proportional to mL. This
is the reason why we will only need to consider third order poles in order to obtain the largevolume leading contribution to the entanglement entropies. To find the leading contribution,
let us denote by sij the number of third order poles evaluated by rapidities belonging to the set

Note that, from (4.63) we see that the dependence on the parameter r2 drops out. Thus the
results do not depend on the distance between regions A and B as long as 0 ď r2 ď 1 in the

Recall that this is exactly the same result as for the single region entanglement entropy [33] with
region length r1 ` r3 . Therefore, as observed earlier for the qubit states, the increment of the
entanglement entropy due to the presence of one excitation is independent of the connectivity
of the region under consideration. This can be shown more generally both with qubits (see
Appendix C) and using form factors.

Replica Logarithmic Negativity

To calculate the leading order large-volume contribution to (4.22) we have to go through exactly
same steps as presented in the previous section. For the logarithmic negativity the last two form
factors are “exchanged” hence the quantization condition in the complete set of states inserted
between the last two fields is now different. This only affects the values of some residua. The
changed residua are

Numerical Results

In this section we present some numerical results for the Rényi entropies and replica logarithmic
negativities of a harmonic chain. Recall that this is a discrete theory whose continuum limit is
27

the massive free boson. Therefore we expect that for appropriate parameter choices we should
find agreement with our predictions of the previous sections. The dispersion relation is
c
∆x p
Eppq “ m2 ` 4∆x´2 sin2
,
(5.1)
2
where ∆x is the lattice spacing, m is the mass and p is the momentum of the excitation. The
QFT regime corresponds to ∆x ¨ p ! 1 where we recover the relativistic dispersion relation.
The numerical procedure was explained in detail in Appendix A of [33] and is based on exact
diagonalization. In all the plots we have chosen:
∆x “ 0.02,

m “ 1,

and L “ 20 .

(5.2)

As explained in [32], the analytical predictions are expected to be valid in the “quasiparticle
regime”, where the lengths of all connected regions (the regions A and B, and the connected
components of C) are large as compared to either the correlation length m´1 , or the De Broglie
wavelengths 2π
p of all excitations (where p is the momentum). Below, all momenta are chosen
to be well within the QFT regime.

B “ rL{2, L{2 ` RL{2s, and the values of R are taken from 0 to 1 by increments of 0.1. The
total subsystem’s length is therefore `1 ` `3 “ RL, ranging from 0 to L.

Numerical values of the 2nd Rényi entropy of a state of two identical excitations (circles) and
two distinct excitation (triangles). The momenta are p1 “ p2 “ 4π for identical excitations
(k “ 2) and p1 “ 3π, p2 “ 4π for two distinct excitations. In all cases agreement with the
analytic results (continuous curves) is excellent.
In Fig. 5 we present results for the Rényi entropies of one excitation. The figure on the
left explores the dependence on the momentum of the excitation; this dependence is shown to
be very small, and the numerical results to agree very well with the analytical prediction. At
p “ 0 the disagreement is slightly larger because in this case only the correlation length m´1 “ 1
controls the accuracy. The relative disagreement is however higher for the small value R “ 0.1
(omitting the trivial value R “ 0) than it is at R “ 0.5, where correlation length effects should
be smallest. The entanglement is higher than predicted at the small value R “ 0.1, where the
regions A and B are small, presumably because one observes additional entanglement due to
the correlations within distances comparable to the correlation length; while it is smaller at
R “ 0.5, presumably because one looses entanglement due to correlations between the regions
A and B which are now adjacent. We observe that the numerical results for p “ π (which is
equal to 10 ¨ 2π{L, giving a De Broglie’s wavelength of 2), 2π (De Broglie’s wavelength of 1)
and 4π (De Broglie’s wavelength of 0.5) are virtually indistinguishable from each other and from
the analytic curve (2.1) here presented as the solid curve. The figure on the right in Fig. 5
shows very good agreement with the analytic predictions for three values of n and relatively
high momentum (De Broglie’s wavelength of 0.5). Similarly good agreement is found for states
consisting of two identical (or not) excitations, whose Rényi entropies are presented in Fig. 6.

5.2

Replica Logarithmic Negativity

We have evaluated numerically the replica logarithmic negativity between regions A and B with
various ratios of lengths. We have chosen A “ r0, f RLs and B “ rf L, f L`p1´f qRLs, where the
ratio of lengths |A|{|B| “ f {p1 ´ f q is controlled by the parameter f taking values 1{2, 2{5 and
29

1{3, giving r1 “ r3 “ R{2 (f “ 1{2), r1 “ 2R{5, r3 “ 3R{5 (f “ 2{5), and r1 “ R{3, r3 “ 2R{3
(f “ 1{3) respectively. The overall scale is again R, ranging from 0 to 1 by increments of 0.1.

The regions’ lengths are therefore `1 “ f RL and `3 “ p1 ´ f qRL, whose sum is RL ranging
from 0 to L. We have used different values of n and different types of excited state (with distinct
and equal excitations). Here we concentrate on higher momenta, which are still well within the
QFT regime but also well within the quasiparticle regime, indeed finding excellent agreement
with our analytic predictions. In Figs. 7 and 8 (left) we present results for k “ 1 and n “ 2, 3
and 4 and different ratios r1 {r3 . Fig. 8 (right) and Fig. 9 explore some configurations for states
with k “ 2, 3 and states of equal/distinct excitations. In particular we find confirmation of the
statement (2.12) that the replica logarithmic negativity of a state of k distinct excitations is k
times the replica logarithmic negativity of the state of one excitation.

Conclusion

In two previous publications [32, 33] we developed a methodology for the evaluation of the Rényi
entropies (and related quantities) in zero-density excited states of one-dimensional free massive
quantum field theory. Three methods were used: a finite-volume form factor approach based
on the use of branch point twist fields and U p1q twist fields, a qubit picture showing that the
same excess entanglement can be obtained from simple qubit states, and, finally, a numerical
approach based on exact diagonalization for a harmonic chain.
These methods have been employed again in the current work to extend results to the Rényi
entropies of any number of disconnected regions and to the replica logarithmic negativity, a
measure of entanglement for non-complementary regions. Our results demonstrate that all three
approaches can still be successfully employed to evaluate the increment experienced by these
more mathematically complex quantities in zero-density excited states. In the current paper we

31

have focussed on the case of the free boson. It would be interesting to extend our results to the
massive Majorana fermion.
We find that the increment of the Rényi, von Neumann, and single copy entropies of multiple
disconnected regions of lengths `i takes exactly
the same form as for a single connected region
ř
of length `, up to the replacement ` ÞÑ i `i . More precisely, in the scaling limit (1.9) the
increment of the Rényi and related entropies is independent of the connectivity of the regions.
It depends only upon their overall length.
For the replica logarithmic negativities we find that their increment is the logarithm of a
symmetric polynomial of the variables r1 and r3 . By employing a qubit picture we have obtained
closed formulae for all such polynomials (2.6). The numerical coefficients involved are given by
(2.7) and point towards a combinatorial interpretation of the result. Indeed, we show in [38] that
such polynomials are partitions functions for counting of particular families of graphs. This is
also true for the Rényi entropies which may be recovered from the replica logarithmic negativity
by taking either r1 or r3 to zero.
From the qubit interpretation of our results we are also able to generalize our conclusions to
any number of disconnected regions and find that both the increments of Rényi entropies and
logarithmic negativities do not depend on the connectivity of the regions, just on the overall
size of each subsystem.
This work, together with [32, 33] and the follow up paper [38], provides a complete understanding of the most popular measures of entanglement in zero-density excited states of free
one-dimensional massive quantum field theory. Some of the results have also been shown to
hold for interacting models [33], and all results hold as well in free higher dimensional theories
[32, 38], the most general proof being given in [38]. The main challenge now is to consider
interacting models more generally and to show under which conditions (if any) these results still
are valid in the presence of interactions. We expect to study this problem in a future work.

Logarithmic Negativity for Identical Particles

The tables below give examples of the sort of polynomials that are obtained for the replica
logarithmic negativities Enk pr1 , r3 q for a state of k identical particles. Recall that, as previously,
r :“ 1 ´ r1 ´ r3 and r1 , r3 are the scaled versions of regions A and B sizes in Fig. 1. As indicated,
the polynomials for n “ 2 can be rewritten entirely in terms of r only. They are the same as
those entering the expressions for the second Rényi entropies ∆S2k prq obtained in [32, 33]. This
is because for n “ 2 we have T “ T̃ and so the two ratios of four-point functions in (1.10) and
(1.11) are identical.

The matrix ρA

B

has non-vanishing eigenvalues
λ1 “ r2 ,

λ2 “ 2rp1 ´ rq and λ3 “ p1 ´ rq2 .

34

(B.6)

Thus, the Rényi entropies are given by
Sn2 pr1 , r3 q “

logpr2n ` p1 ´ rq2n ` p2rp1 ´ rqqn q
,
1´n

(B.7)

and this is the expected formula found in [32, 33]. The matrix ρTABŤ B has non-vanishing eigenvalues given by
a

λt1 “ r12 , λt2 “ r32 , λt3 “ rr1 ` r1 r2 ` 2r1 r3 , λt4 “ rr1 ´ r1 r2 ` 2r1 r3 ,
a
a
λt5 “ rr3 ` r3 r2 ` 2r1 r3 , λt6 “ rr3 ´ r3 r2 ` 2r1 r3 , λt7 , λt8 , λt9 ,
(B.8)
where λt7,8,9 are the roots of the cubic equation:
2r13 r33 ´ r1 r3 p2r2 ` r1 r3 qx ´ pr2 ` 2r1 r3 qx2 ` x3 “ 0 .

(B.9)

Let us consider a generic equation of the form x3 ` bx2 ` cx ` d “ 0. The roots of such an
equation may be written in closed form as:
ˆ
˙
2πi
∆0

k˜

(B.11)

and
∆0 “ b2 ´ 3c,

∆1 “ 2b3 ´ 9bc ` 27d.

(B.12)

The roots of the polynomial (B.9) correspond to the identifications λt7 :“ x0 , λt8 :“ x1 and
λt9 :“ x2 as well as
b “ ´r2 ´ 2r1 r3 ,

c “ ´r1 r3 p2r2 ` r1 r3 q ,

and d “ 2r13 r33 .

(B.13)

With these identifications we obtain the values of ∆0 and ∆1 reported in (2.10) and in (2.9).
Although there are now 9 non-vanishing eigenvalues and the expressions are much more
complicated than for ρAŤB , it is easy to deduce that the sum of the n-th powers of the first six
non-vanishing eigenvalues is the polynomial:
σ1 pnq :“

˙
2n´p rn´2p r1p r3p .

(B.14)

Comparing to the general formula (2.6) we have that the term r12n corresponds to taking p “ 2,
in which case, for k “ 2, the only possible value of q is 0 with coefficient A2,0 “ 1. The term r32n
is generated from (2.6) as well for p “ ´2, in which case the only possible value of q is q “ 2n.
This gives coefficient A´2,2n “ 1. The remaining terms above correspond to the values p “ ˘1
in (2.6) in which case we get two sums, one proportional to pr1 rqn and the other to pr3 rqn as
35

above. In this contribution the coefficients A˘1,q once again are related to counting partitions
into 0s and 1s with no consecutive 1s.
The sum pλt7 qn ` pλt8 qn ` pλt9 qn is found (by inspection) to have the following structure:

which corresponds to the p “ 0 contribution in (2.6). The coefficients are positive and integer
and they can be systematically computed from the explicit formulae for the eigenvalues λt7 , λt8
and λt9 , and/or by employing some useful properties of roots of third order polynomials as
described for instance in [59]. The first few coefficients are given by

(B.17)

Interestingly, all the coefficients above are positive integers for n integer and they can be shown
to agree with the formula (2.7), even though showing this analytically is relatively involved as
there is a sum over partitions to perform. The replica logarithmic negativities are then given by
En2 pr1 , r3 q “ logpσ1 pnq ` σ2 pnqq,

(B.18)

As usual, we are interested in the analytic continuation of this result to n “ 1. In this case, as
we know all roots explicitly we can simply compute the logarithmic negativity using its formal
definition as the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of the partially transposed, reduced
density matrix. We have that

However, once more, closed formulae for the sum of powers of the remaining eigenvalues are
less straightforward to obtain. It is however possible to obtain an expression for the logarithmic
negativity by employing general properties of the roots of cubic and quartic equations. We find
that the contribution to the negativity from the first six eigenvalues is simply:

Entanglement Measures for an Arbitrary Number of Disconnected Regions from Qubits

It is possible to extend the calculations of subsection 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 to a situation where regions
A and B are not simply connected. Here we will present the detailed computation for the
Rényi entropies and later comment on how a similar generalization may work for the replica
logarithmic negativities.

C.1

Rényi Entropies of α Disconnected Regions

Let us consider the case when one of our subsystems is composed of α disconnected regions
Ť
Rm with m “ 1, . . . , α. Let R0 be the rest of the system and R1 :“ m Rm . In this case the
Ť 1
whole bipartite system is composed by R0 R and described by a Hilbert space H “ H0 b H1
38

where now H1 “ H1 b ¨ ¨ ¨ b Hα . Again, we can define an orthonormal basis t|kyřP H : k “
pk0 , . . . , kα q P Nα`1
u such that km is the number of excitations in region Rm and αm“1 km “ k
0
for a state of k identical excitations. Let
r1 “

α
ÿ

rm “ 1 ´ r0

(C.1)

m“1

where rm is the scaled length of region Rm . We define the qubit state:

(C.2)

where σ0α`1 pkq represents the set of integer partitions of k into α ` 1 non-negative parts. It
is easy to extend (1.2) to the case of α disconnected regions. Indeed, if we now introduce
Snk pr1 , . . . , rα q :“ exp tp1 ´ nqSnk pr1 , . . . , rα qu where Snk pr1 , . . . , rα q is the Rényi entropy for the
state (C.2) it is easy to see that this can be written as:
¨

and k0i “ k ´ γ “: q

for i “ 1, . . . , n.

(C.6)

As in the two region case k0i does not depend on any km

(C.7)
Again the multinomial coefficients constrain the sums. The presence of q! in the denominator
i must be non-negative for all i “ 1, . . . , n and m “
means that q ě 0. We know also that km
ř
i
1, . . . , α ´ 1. Furthermore the only non-zero terms in the sums are given by k ´ q ´ α´1
m“1 km ě 0
39

and thus q ď k. In summary, for the same reasons as in the two region case 0 ď q ď k.
We can re-write (C.7) as:
Snk pr1 , . . . , rα q

(C.12)

notice it takes the same form as (2.2) (with r replaced by r0 ). Therefore, the Rényi (and related)
entropies of this particular class of qubit states depend only on the relative size of the two parts
in the bipartition and not on whether or not they are connected.

C.2

Replica Logarithmic Negativities of Disconnected Regions

A very similar computation can be performed for the replica logarithmic negativities. The
starting point is the assumption that regions A and B are now disconnected, namely
A“

α
Ť

Ai

and

i“1

B“

β
Ť

Bi ,

(C.13)

i“1

so that A consists of a number α and B of a number β of disconnected regions. Let regions Ai
and Bi have scaled lengths given by r1i and r3i , respectively. Then our results for the (replica)
40

logarithmic negativities will still hold up to the identifications:
α
ÿ

r1 “

r1i ,

r3 “

β
ÿ

r3i ,

and

r “ 1 ´ r1 ´ r3 .

(C.14)

i“1

i“1

In the qubit picture this can be shown in a very similar way as for the Rényi entropies in the
previous section, so we do not present the computation here.

Form Factors and Residue Formulae

Let upβq and vpβq be generic functions of β such that vpβq has a single zero at β “ θ. The
corresponding residua of the following first, second, and third order poles are given by
u pβq

(D.1)
(D.2)

(D.3)

These generic formulae have been employed in order to obtain (4.57). In particular, the function
g̃prq defined in (4.58) results from the evaluation of residua of third order poles of the type

with r :“ Lx and where P pθq, Epθq are the momentum and energy. Lower order poles of a similar
type give the following residua

These results justify the claim that only third order poles produce contributions that are proportional to the volume.

and the denominator factors are cancelled by the form factor residues in the calculation.
