The prominent Dicke superradiant phase arises from coupling an ensemble of atoms to cavity
optical field when external optical pumping exceeds a threshold strength. Here we report a prediction
of the superrandiant instability driven by Anderson localization, realized with a hybrid system of
Dicke and Aubry-André (DAA) model for bosons trapped in a one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic
optical lattice and coupled to a cavity. Our central finding is that for bosons condensed in localized
phase given by the DAA model, the resonant superradiant scattering is induced, for which the critical
optical pumping of superradiant phase transition approaches zero, giving an instability driven by
Anderson localization. The superradiant phase for the DAA model with or without a mobility edge
is investigated, showing that the localization driven superradiant instability is in sharp contrast
to the superradiance as widely observed for Bose condensate in extended states, and should be
insensitive to temperature of the system. This study unveils an insightful effect of localization on
the Dicke superradiance, and is well accessible based on the current experiments.

Combining cold atomic gases with cavity quantum
electrodynamics [1–9] has provided a unique platform to
explore exotic quantum states in atom-cavity coupling
systems [10–21]. In particular, the cavity field mediates
an effective long-range interaction between all atoms,
and a prominent superradiant phase with the atoms absorbing and emitting the photons collectively was predicted in the notable Dicke model [22, 23]. Such superradiance transition has been achieved dynamically with
a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled to a transversely pumped optical cavity [24–28]. Furthermore, for
degenerate Fermi gases inside a cavity, the superradiance
with enhancement by the Fermi surface nesting was predicted [29–31], and further the topological superradiant
phases were also proposed [32, 33]. These studies reveal
the strong correlations between cavity photons and external center-of-mass (COM) motion of atomic assembles
in the dispersive coupling regime [8], with many exotic
nonequilibrium quantum behaviors having been uncovered in these open systems [34–36].
The emergence of superradiance for BECs in a cavity is typically associated with the formation of a selforganized supersolid [24, 25]. The disordered potential,
if applied to the atoms, is expected to have significant effect on superradiance. In particular, the cavity-induced
incommensurate lattice can induce the Bose-glass phases
in Bose-Hubbard system as the optical pumping is strong
enough [37], affect localization transition of the atomic
COM motion [38, 39], and lead to anomalous diffusion of
the atomic wavepackets [40]. In these studies, the atoms
are in ordered or extended states before the superradiance occurs. A question is, what happens if considering

the coupling of an initially localized phase to cavity?
In this letter, we investigate a BEC in a localized phase
given by a one-dimensional quasi-periodical superlattice
potential and coupled to a transversely-pumped optical
cavity, the latter providing an effective long range interaction between the atoms. The incommensurate quasiperiodical potential can lead to the Anderson localization [41–52] and many-body localization which has attracted a considerable amount of interest recently [53–
56]. In the extended regime, increasing the strength of
the incommensurate potential can facilitate the tendency
to the superradiant phase. Surprisingly, when the atoms
enter the localized phase, we show that an unprecedented
superradiant instability is driven by the resonant superradiant scatterings, for which the superradiance occurs
at arbitrarily small optical pumping strength.
We consider a BEC inside a high-finesse optical cavity along the x-direction (Fig. 1). The atoms experience
a one-dimensional (1D) static bichromatic incommensurate potential Vstatic (x) = V1 cos2 (k1 x) + V2 cos2 (k2 x + φ)
obtained by superimposing two optical lattices, with φ
a tunable relative phase, and are also illuminated by
a standing-wave pumping laser with the frequency ωp
in the z-direction. The transverse confinement is sufficiently large so that the transverse motion of atoms
is suppressed.R In the rotating frame, the Hamiltonian
reads Ĥ = dxψ̂ † (x)Ĥ ψ̂(x) − ~∆c â† â, where ∆c =
ωp − ωc is the detuning between the pump laser and
the cavity field, ψ̂(x) and â are the annihilation operators of the atom and cavity photon respectively. The full
atomic Hamiltonian reads Ĥ = Ĥ0 + Vdynamic (x), with

The atoms are subjected to a 1D static bichromatic potential

suppressed by a large transverse confinement.

the transverse pumping via atoms, with η0 = gΩ/∆a being the strength of the interference between the pump

atom-cavity coupling strength, ∆a = ωp − ωa denotes the
detuning between the pumping laser and atomic transition frequency ωa , Ω is the strength (Rabi frequency) of

To better understand the model, we analyze first the
situation without the pumping laser and the cavity field.
We choose V1 cos2 (k1 x) (V1 > V2 ) as the prime lattice, and the secondary lattice V2 cos2 (k2 x) is relatively
weaker. In the tight-binding limit, the atomic Hamiltonian Ĥ0 for the bichromatic potential can be cast in the

Anderson transition from extended to localized states

Such Anderson transition has been well observed for noninteracting BECs [42, 43] and photonic crystals [44]. Beyond the tight-binding limit, corrections are added to

amplitude, J 0 and χ0 are the correction parameters to the
tunneling parameter J and disorder strength χ, respectively. Unlike the AA model, the GAA model may have
an intermediate phase, where the localized and extended
eigenstates can coexist and separated by a single-particle
mobility edge (SPME) [56].
Our whole system is a hybrid Dicke and Aubry-André
(DAA) model, characterizing BEC in the quasi-periodic
lattice and coupled to the cavity. The dynamics of the
BEC and the cavity field can be captured by the master equation ρ̇ = −i[Ĥ, ρ] + Lρ on the density matrix ρ,
where Lρ = κ(2âρâ† − â† âρ − ρâ† â) is a Lindblad term to
describe the cavity loss with a decay rate κ. Replacing
the field operator by the c-number a ≡ hâi yields i∂t a =

Note that hĉ†j ĉj i itself depends on the cavity-assisted potential, and should be determined self-consistently. In
general, one can expect a transition from a “normal”
state with a = 0 to a “superradiant” state with a 6= 0 by
tuning e.g. the optical pumping strength η.
Figure 2 shows the numerical results of the critical pumping strength ηc versus the energy of the BEC
state for the GAA/AA model. For χ/J = 2.1, the
GAA model gives an intermediate phase with a SPME
around the energy c /J ' 0.44. As depicted in the inset of Fig. 2, the inverse participation ratio IPR(α) ≡

j | /(
j |φj | ) vanishes for extended states and
becomes finite for localized states across the SPME. For
the AA model, as χ/J > 2, the system is in the localization phase with all the eigenstates being localized.
Our key observation is that an unprecedented localization driven superradiant instability of the cavity field
is obtained, i.e. the cavity field emerges spontaneously
for an arbitrarily small pumping strength. More exactly,
whenever the BEC is in a localized state, no matter the
ground state or an excited one, the superradiance can
take place at a vanishing critical pumping strength. This
is in sharp contrast to the extended state, where a finite
pumping strength is generally required [24–28] (see also
the blue-dotted line of the GAA model in Fig. 2). Since
all the states in AA model with χ/J > 2 are localized
and not thermalizable, the superradiant instability can
be obtained for the BEC with any energy within the localized band, implying that this result is insensitive to
the temperature.
To gain a deeper insight to the underlying physics, we
analyze the superradiant behaviour as the atomic wavefunction undergoes delocalization-to-localization transition. We take the AA model for illustration.

β denote the scatterings between α and β states. For the superradiant transition,
we take that the atoms are condensed in the lowest state
α = 0, and weakly scattered to other states when cavity field emerges. In this case only the scattering terms
s0α and h0α are relevant. We define for convenience
sα ≡ s0α = s∗α0 and hα ≡ hα0 = h∗α0 . The case for
atoms initially condensed in other states is similar.
Now we examine the superradiance phase transition.
For the case χ < 2, the wavefunctions of the states are
extended, resembling the quasi-momentum states. One
can find that the cavity field cannot induce self-scattering

within the ground state and so s0 = 0. The critical value

with f1 =

h0 = 1/2 gives a constant shift of cavity detuning. In
the extended regime, the susceptibility f1 is finite and
the critical value of the pumping strength determined
by Eq. (7) is also finite. On the other hand, Fig. 3(a)
shows that as the disorder strength increases, the value
f1 increases rapidly (red curve), and the superradiance
tendency is strongly enhanced, with the critical pumping field strength ηc (blue curve) decreasing significantly
with increasing the disorder lattice potential. When increasing χ to the delocalization-to-localization transition
point with χ = 2, the susceptibility f1 diverges and the
superradiance threshold becomes zero.
The unique role played by incommensurate lattice potential on the superradiance enhancement becomes more
transparent in the momentum space. For the limit case
with χ = 0 (no secondary disorder lattice), the momentum distribution of the ground state, P (k/k1 ) =

and 2k1 (equivalent to −2k1 ) in the first Brillouin zone
[43–47]. The momentum peaks of the α-th excited state
are found to appear at ±αk1 /L and ±(2 − α/L)k1 , which
are shifted from the primary peaks of the ground state
by ±αk1 /L, with α being integers, as shown in Fig. 3(b).
Note that the pumping laser and cavity field excite the
atoms from the ground state to the excited states. The
scattering to the α-th state contributes to the susceptibility f1α ≡ |sα |2 /ε0α . A cavity photon carries a momentum
kc , so only the α0 -th state with α0 = 2L(1 − γc ) that
matches the cavity mode can be excited, giving a lattice
version of Dicke model for noninteracting Bose gas.
When the secondary lattice is added, the momentum
distributions of the eigenstates are modified with the
appearance of new peaks. For the ground state, additional peaks ±2(k1 − k2 ), ±2k2 occur between the primary peaks. Accordingly, we show that new momentum
peaks of the excited states appear around the peaks of
the ground state by the distance αk1 /L, see the dashed
lines in Fig. 3(c). In this case, besides the α0 -th state,
we find two new excited states that take part in the
atom-light scattering process, with α1 = 2L(γc − γ) and
α2 = 2L(γc + 2γ − 2), see Fig. 3(d). Compared to the α1 th state, which is a higher-excited state near the α0 -th
state, the α2 -th state is located near the low-energy excitation regime, and can dominate the contribution to the
susceptibility. As the incommensurate lattice potential
increases, more and more peaks arise in the momentum
distributions of the ground and excited states, enhancing
the contribution to the susceptibility and decreasing the
critical pumping of the superradiant transition.
The nontrivial transition is obtained as the disorder
strength χ approaches 2, beyond which the eigenstates
become localized in real space, but extended in the momentum space, namely, the momentum distribution of
each state span the whole momentum space (see the inset of Fig. 3e for a reference). In such a situation, each
localized state, including the ground state with energy
ε0 , can be scattered to itself by the cavity field via inducing transition between different momentum components
within the localized state. This gives rise to the resonant

the resonant self-scattering term f10 , for which superradiant instability is induced and the threshold pumping
strength vanishes, as shown in Fig. 3(a).
We can find that ηc ≡ 0 in the whole localized regime.
The direct calculation shows that sαα is finite for any localized state as χ > 2 and approaches cos(2πγc jl ) in the
deep localized regime, where jl is the central site of the
localized wavefunction. For a localized state distributing over a few neighboring sites, the coherence of the
light scattering by the atoms in such different sites can
survive. The backaction of the cavity makes the wavefunction of each state be more localized, giving rise to the

self-organization at arbitrarily small pumping strength.
Finally we present in Fig. 4 the dependence of critical
pumping field strength ηc on the wave vector of cavity
field, as characterized by γc , with different disordered
potential strengths. When γc matches with the disorder
potential, i.e. γc ∼ nγ or n(1 − γ) mod 1, with n being
a positive integer (see the arrows in Fig. 4), the critical
pumping strength drops more quickly with the disorder
potential. This is because the cavity field enhances the
disorder potential. Furthermore, by analyzing carefully
the size effect from L = 300 to L = 10000 sites, we find
that the results are size-independent. Note that in real
experiment, a weak harmonic potential is needed to trap
BEC, which however cannot affect the localization properties substantially [43]. With the Gauss approximation
p
of the Wannier state, J ∼p(V1 /ER )0.75 exp(− V1 /ER )
and χ ∼ (V2 /ER ) exp(−1/ V1 /ER ) with the recoil energy of the prime lattice ER = ~2 k12 /(2m) [46], one can
tune χ and J by varying V2 /V1 .
In conclusion, we have predicted theoretically a novel
superradiant instability by coupling the BEC in a localized phase to the cavity, in which the optical pumping threshold for the superradiance vanishes. The localization drives resonant superradiant scattering, in sharp
contrast to the extended phases, for which the superradiance phase can occur at a vanishing pumping strength.
The prediction is well accessible in the current experiments, and is expected to be valid in the many-body
localization regime [53–56] which is achieved once interaction between atoms is included to the present DAA
model. This works can open up an intriguing avenue in
bridging the studies on the Dicke superradiance and the
Anderson localization or many-body localization.
