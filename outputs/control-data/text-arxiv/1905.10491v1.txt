Abstract. In this paper we prove the existence of finite traveling-wave type solutions to the nonlinear double degenerate parabolic equation of turbulent filtration with absorption.

1. Introduction
In this paper we consider the nonlinear double degenerate parabolic equation of turbulent filtration with absorption

x

with mp > 1, (m, p > 0), 0 < β < 1, and b > 0. The condition that mp > 1 implies that the solutions of
(1) travel with a finite speed of propagation (slow diffusion case). We are interested in finding finite
traveling-wave solutions to (1): u(x, t) = ϕ(kt − x), where the function ϕ is such that: ϕ(z) ≥ 0, ϕ . 0,
ϕ(z) → 0+ as z → −∞, and ϕ(0) = 0.
Equation (1) admits a finite traveling-wave solution if there exists ϕ ∈ R+ that satisfies the following initial-value-problem (IVP)

The existence of traveling-wave solutions with interfaces for the nonlinear reaction-diffusion
equation ((1) with p = 1) is pursued in [34]. Existence of traveling-wave type solutions to (1) for
the parabolic p-Laplacian equation is considered in [45].
It is of note that currently there is a well established general theory of nonlinear degenerate
parabolic equations, beginning with [46]; see also [52, 22, 51, 26, 4, 9, 8, 10, 11, 12, 7, 6, 3, 1, 20,
19, 33, 34, 41, 38, 43, 50, 29, 21, 18, 2, 18, 23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 32, 42, 44, 48]). Boundary value
problems for (1) have been investigated in [40, 39, 28, 49, 35, 25, 37, 36, 47].
Let
(3)

u(x, 0) = u0 (x), x ∈ R.

The solution of the Cauchy problem (CP) (1), (3) is understood in the weak sense (see Definition 1
from [13]). The full classification of the interfaces
η(t) := sup{x : u(x, t) > 0}, η(0) = 0,
and local solutions near the interfaces for the Cauchy problem (1), (3) is established in [13] in the
slow diffusion case (mp > 1) and in [17] for the fast diffusion case (0 < mp < 1). This classification
is done for the nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation ((1) with p = 1) in [16] for the slow diffusion
case and in [5] for the fast diffusion case; and for the parabolic p-Laplacian diffusion-reaction
equation ((1) with m = 1) in [15] for the slow diffusion case and in [14] for the fast diffusion case.
The use of finite traveling-wave solutions was essential to prove asymtotic results for the interface
and the local solution near the interface in the cases where diffusion and reaction forces are in
balance.
The organization of the paper is as follows: in Section 2 we formulate and prove some preliminary results which are necessary for the proof of main result and in Section 3 we prove the main
result, Theorem 1.

2. Traveling-Wave Solutions and Phase-Space Analysis
In this section we’ll apply phase-space analysis to find finite traveling-wave solutions for (1). We
aim to analyze the phase portrait for problem (2). We establish an essential monotinicity property
of ϕ.
Lemma 1. If ϕ is a positive solution to (2), then ϕ is increasing on (0,+∞).
Proof of Lemma 1. If k < 0, the result easily follows since the solution to(2) cannot obtain a local
maximum. For k > 0, the result follows as in the analogous proof for the p-Laplacian equation in
[45] by choosing

Now, we want to show that there exists such a ϕ(z) > 0. We introduce the following change of
variable
Θ = ϕ and Υ = ((ϕm )0 ) p ,
it follows that

where (Θ, Υ) starts from (0,0) at z = 0, exists for any z ∈ R+ , and are contained in the first quadrant:
Q1 = {(Θ, Υ) : Θ, Υ > 0} for z > 0. We claim that there exists a unique solution, or trajectory, Υ(Θ).

As done in [45] for the analogous problem for the p-Laplacian equation, we find the nontrivial
trajectories, Υ(Θ), to (4), in two steps. First we prove the global existence of the solution of the
following perturbed IVP


= f (Θ, Υ) = k + bmΘm+β−1 Υ− p ,
 dΘ
(5)


Υ(0) = ε, ε > 0.
Since f (Θ, Υ) is locally Lipshitz continuous in R+ × (ε, +∞), there exists a unique local solution
to (5), Υε . For k > 0 and for k < 0 with p(m + β) > 1 + p, the proof of the existence of a global
solution to (5) follows as in the proof of the existence of a global solution to the analgous IVP for
the p-Laplacian equation in [45].
f (Θ, Υ) is strictly increasing and satisfies the following inequality

so it follows that

hence, Υε is a global solution. Let k > 0 and p(m + β) > 1 + p. Let p(m + β) > 1 + p. For k < 0,

then we have f (Θ, Υ) = 0 on C and C divides the first quadrant, Ω1 , into two regions: Rl = {(Θ, Υ) :
f (Θ, Υ) < 0} and Rr = {(Θ, Υ) : f (Θ, Υ) > 0}, see Fig. 1a. Υε starts in region Rl , then Υε must cross

Since the right hand side of (7) is Lipshitz continuous, there exists a local solution, vε , to the CP
(7). For k > 0 and for k < 0 with p(m + β) > 1 + p, as for (5), the proof of the existence of a global
solution to (6) follows as in the proof of the existence of a global solution to the analgous IVP for
the p-Laplacian equation in [45]. We have the following inequality

lim vε (t) = +∞.

t→+∞

Hence, vε is one-to-one from [0, +∞) to [ε, +∞). Now, let wε denote the inverse function of vε ,
defined from [ε, +∞) to [0, +∞). Clearly, wε satisfies the following CP

Therefore, the CP (6) has a unique global solution for any ε > 0. Now, let k < 0 with p(m+β) < 1+ p.

e as
As before, we define the curve where f (v, t) = 0 by C.

Lemma 2. The problem (4) has a unique global solution.
The proof of Lemma 2 follows as in the proof of existence and uniqueness of solution for the
analogous problem for the p-Laplacian equation in [45].

Proof of Lemma 3. We begin by proving formulas (1) and (2). We apply nonlinear scaling as follows: we choose Υl (Θ) = lΥ(lγ Θ), with l > 0 and γ to be determined.
Υl (Θ) = lΥ(lγ Θ) ⇐⇒ Υ(Θ) = l−1 Υl (l−γ Θ).
We set Z = lγ Θ. It follows from (4) that

To prove formulas (3) and (4) we let k > 0 and proceed as in the proof of formulas (1) and (2). We

To prove the existence of this limit, let 0 ≤ Γ < ∆ < +∞. We show
(1) {Υl } is uniformly bounded, i.e., |Υl (Θ)| ≤ C, for all Θ ∈ [Γ, ∆] and l, where C is independent
of l.
(2) {Υl } is equicontinuous, i.e., for any ε > 0, there exists δ = δε > 0 such that for all Θ, Θ0 ∈
[Γ, ∆] we have
|Θ − Θ0 | < δ =⇒ |Υl (Θ) − Υl (Θ0 )| < ε, ∀ l.
First we prove that {Υl } is uniformly bounded. Since we want to pass l to zero, we fix l ∈ (0, 1]. So

0 ≤ Υl (Θ) ≤ Υ1 (Θ), ∀ Θ ∈ [0, ∆], ∀ l ∈ (0, 1].
It remains to show that

dΥl

is uniformly bounded. Let Θ ∈ [Γ, ∆]. Since k > 0 we have that

This holds for all l ∈ (0, 1]. Since dΥ
dΘ is uniformly bounded on [Γ, ∆] it follows that Υl (Θ) is
uniformly bounded on [Γ, ∆]. Now we need to show that {Υl } is equicontinuous on [Γ, ∆]. Let
Θ, Θ0 ∈ [Γ, ∆]. We need to show that for any ε > 0, there exists δ = δε > 0 such that

|Θ − Θ0 | < δ =⇒ |Υl (Θ) − Υl (Θ0 )| < ε, ∀ l.
By Lagrange’s mean value theorem, for all θ ∈ [0, 1], we have
|Υl (Θ) − Υl (Θ0 )| =

dΥl (Θ0 + θ(Θ − Θ0 ))
(Θ − Θ0 ) ≤ C|Θ − Θ0 | < Cδ.
dΘ

Choosing δ = Cε ensures that |Υl (Θ) − Υl (Θ0 )| < ε, ∀ l. So {Υl } is equicontinuous on [Γ, ∆]. Since {Υl }
is both uniformly bounded and equicontinuous on [Γ, ∆], and since [Γ, ∆] is an arbitrary compact

3. Proof of the Main Result
Using the results above, we prove Theorem 1.
Proof of Theorem 1. As long as ϕ(z) , 0 (Υ(ϕ(z)) , 0), we can rewrite (10) in the following way
1

mϕm−1 Υ− p (ϕ(z))dϕ(z) = dz.

(22)

We will prove formula (2), the proof of formula (1) and formulas (3)-(6) follows in a similar way
by choosing the appropriate asymptotic formula for Υ(Θ) from Lemma 3.
Since p(m + β) > 1 + p, from Lemma 3 we know that
p
