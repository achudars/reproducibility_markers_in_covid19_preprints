Abstract We design and analyze a posteriori error estimators for the Stokes
system with singular sources in suitable W1,p ×Lp spaces. We consider classical
low-order inf-sup stable and stabilized finite element discretizations. We prove,
in two and three dimensional Lipschitz, but not necessarily convex polytopal
domains, that the devised error estimators are reliable and locally efficient. On
the basis of the devised error estimators, we design a simple adaptive strategy that yields optimal experimental rates of convergence for the numerical
examples that we perform.

1 Introduction
For d ∈ {2, 3}, we let Ω be an open and bounded polytopal domain in Rd with
Lipschitz boundary ∂Ω. The purpose of this work is the design and analysis of
a posteriori error estimators for classical low-order inf-sup stable and stabilized
finite element approximations of the Stokes problem

where δx0 corresponds to the Dirac delta supported at the interior point x0 ∈ Ω
and f ∈ Rd . As it is customary in fluid mechanics, u represents the velocity of
the fluid, π the pressure and f δx0 is an externally applied force. Notice that,
for simplicity, we have taken the viscosity to be equal to one. An instance
of (1) appears in the modeling of active thin structures [18, 25]; there the
right hand side is a linear combination of Dirac deltas supported at interior
points of Ω. We also mention other applications such as the use of flagella by
sessile organisms to generate feeding currents [22], modeling the flow of a fluid
through structures with singular sources [21, 27], slender body theories [14],
improved models for the movement by cilia [10], and optimal control of fluid
flows [2, 17].
When the body force acting on the fluid and the mass production rate are
smooth, the study of solution techniques for the Stokes and related models
within a standard Hilbert space–based setting is well understood [16, 20].
However, recent models have emerged where the motion of an incompressible
fluid is described by problem (1) or a small variation of it. Due to the singular
nature of the body force f δx0 , the problem must be understood in a completely
different setting where the analysis of approximation techniques is scarce. Since
Ω is a Lipschitz polytope, the fact that δx0 ∈ W−1,p (Ω), with p ∈ (1, d/(d−1)),
yields the existence of a unique solution (u, π) ∈ W1,p (Ω) × Lp (Ω)/R with
p ∈ (2d/(d + 1) − ε, d/(d − 1)) [13, 26, 28]. Here, ε denotes a positive constant
that depends on Ω. For a complete treatment of boundary value problems for
the Stokes system on Lipschitz domains we refer the reader to [28], where the
authors prove optimal well–posedness results in all space dimensions and for
all major types of boundary conditions.
Regarding the design and analysis of solution techniques for problem (1),
and to the best of our knowledge, the first work that proposed an scheme is
[25]. Later, the authors of [9] derived quasi–optimal local convergence results
in H1 × L2 . The authors operated under the assumption that the underlying
domain Ω ⊂ R2 is an open and bounded C ∞ domain, or a square, and considered finite element discretizations based on the mini element and Taylor–Hood
approximations. The error is analyzed on a subdomain which does not contain
the singularity of the involved solution. On the other hand, in view of the
fact that there is a Muckenhoupt weight ω related to the distance to x0 such
that δx0 ∈ H−1 (ω, Ω), the authors of [3, 15] have operated within a weighted

Sobolev space setting and derived a priori and a posteriori error estimates for
classical low–order inf–sup stable finite element approximations.
Since δx0 is very singular, it is not expected for the pair (u, π), solution to
(1), to have any global regularity properties beyond those inherited from the
well–posedness of the problem. As a consequence, optimal error estimates for
classical low–order inf–sup stable finite element approximations, such as the
mini element and the lowest order Taylor–Hood element, cannot be expected.
This motivates the design and analysis of adaptive finite element methods
(AFEMs) for the efficient resolution of problem (1) since they are known to
outperform classical FEM in practice and deliver optimal convergence rates
when FEM cannot. AFEMs are a fundamental numerical tool in science and
engineering that allow for the resolution of PDEs with relatively modest computational resources. An essential ingredient of an AFEM is an a posteriori
error estimator. This is a computable quantity that depends on the discrete
solution and data, and provides information about the local quality of the
approximate solution. Therefore, it can be used for adaptive mesh refinement
and coarsening, error control, and equidistribution of the computational effort.
The a posteriori error analysis for linear second-order elliptic boundary value
problems has attained a mature understanding [1, 29, 33].
In contrast to the well-established theory for linear elliptic PDEs with
smooth data, the a posteriori error analysis for finite element approximations
of problems with singular forcing has not yet been fully understood. The main
source of difficulty is the reduced regularity properties exhibited by the underlying solution. Within this context, the first work that provides an a posteriori
error analysis for a finite element approximation of a Poisson problem with
a Dirac delta as a forcing term is [7]. The authors of this work utilize suitable W1,p –norms and design, on a two dimensional setting, residual–type a
posteriori error estimators. The devised estimators are proven to be reliable
and locally efficient. We would like to also mention reference [4] where the authors consider a posteriori error estimates for an electrostatics problem with a
current dipole source and extend some of the results of [7] to the three dimensional case. This is a singular problem, since the current dipole model involves
first–order derivatives of a Dirac delta measure.
To the best of our knowledge, the only work that provides an advance
concerning the a posteriori error analysis for the Stokes system (1) is [3]. In
such a work, the authors propose a posteriori error estimators for classical low–
order inf–sup stable and stabilized finite element approximations of the Stokes
problem (1) in two and three dimensional Lipschitz polytopal domains. The
authors operate within the setting of Muckenhoupt weighted Sobolev spaces
and prove that the devised error estimators are reliable and locally efficient. In
contrast, in this work we operate under a complete different setting; we make
use of the fact that, since Ω ⊂ Rd is Lipschitz (d ∈ {2, 3}), there exists ε > 0
such that (u, π) ∈ W1,p (Ω) × Lp (Ω)/R with p ∈ (2d/(d + 1) − ε, d/(d − 1))
and devise a posteriori error estimator based on Lp –norms. We consider the
classical saddle point formulation of (1) and propose approximations based
on popular low–order inf–sup stable and stabilized finite elements. For all

4

these schemes, we devise a posteriori error estimators that are proven to be
globally reliable and locally efficient when the approximation error is measured
in suitable W1,p (Ω)×Lp (Ω)–norms. With the proposed estimators at hand, we
also design simple adaptive strategies that yield optimal rates of convergence
for the numerical examples that we perform.
The outline of this manuscript is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce
the notation and functional framework we shall work with. In Section 3 we
present a saddle point formulation for the Stokes system (1). We also review
the well–posedness of the system and state regularity properties of its solution. In Section 4 we introduce classical low–order inf–sup stable finite element
approximations of (1). The core of our work is Section 5, where we design a
posteriori error estimators and obtain global reliability and local efficiency results. We extend, in Section 6, the results obtained in Section 5 to the case
when stabilized finite element approximations are considered. Finally, in Section 7, we report numerical tests, in two and three dimensions, that illustrate
the theory and exhibit the performance of the devised estimators.

2 Notation and preliminaries
Let us set notation and describe the setting we shall operate with.
Throughout this work, d ∈ {2, 3} and Ω is an open and bounded polytopal
domain of Rd with Lipschitz boundary ∂Ω. If X and Y are normed vector
spaces, we write X ֒→ Y to denote that X is continuously embedded in Y .
We denote by X ′ and k · kX the dual and the norm of X , respectively.
Given p ∈ (1, ∞), we denote by p′ the real number such that 1/p+1/p′ = 1,
i.e., p′ = p/(p − 1).
The relation a . b indicates that a ≤ Cb, with a positive constant C which
is independent of a, b, and the size of the elements in the mesh. The value of
C might change at each occurrence.

3 The model problem
We begin with a motivation for the use of the spaces W1,p (Ω) × Lp (Ω) with
p < d/(d − 1).

3.1 Motivation
Let us assume that Ω = Rd . If this is the case, the results of [19, Section
IV.2] yield the following asymptotic behavior, near the point x0 ∈ Ω, for the
solution (u, π) to problem (1):
|∇u(x)| ≈ |x − x0 |1−d ,

|π(x)| ≈ |x − x0 |1−d .

(2)

This immediately implies that (u, π) ∈
/ H10 (Ω) × L2 (Ω). More precisely, a
simple computation based on (2) suggests that |∇u| ∈ Lp (Ω) and π ∈ Lp (Ω)
provided p < d/(d − 1).
3.2 Saddle point formulation
The motivation presented in Section 3.1 suggests to consider the following
saddle point formulation for problem (1): Find (u, π) ∈ W01,p (Ω) × Lp (Ω)/R,
with p < d/(d − 1), such that
a(u, v) + b(v, π) = hf δx0 , vi
b(u, q) = 0

∀ v ∈ W01,p′ (Ω),
∀ q ∈ Lp′ (Ω)/R,

(3)

where h·, ·i denotes the duality pairing between the spaces W−1,p (Ω) :=
W01,p′ (Ω)′ and W01,p′ (Ω). The bilinear forms a(·, ·) and b(·, ·) are defined, respectively, by

∇w : ∇v,
b(v, q) := −
a(w, v) :=

3.3 Well–posedness
Our heuristic argument suggests that the well–posedness of problem (3) is
conditioned to p < d/(d − 1). To make matters precise, we introduce GD
as the Green operator for the inhomogeneous problem for the incompressible
Stokes system with vanishing Dirichlet boundary conditions. That is, if (ϕ, ξ)
solves
−∆ϕ + ∇ξ = F in Ω, divϕ = 0 in Ω, ϕ = 0 on ∂Ω,
then GD F := ϕ. The regularity results of [28, Corollary 1.7] (with α = −1 and
q = 2) guarantee that the operator GD : W−1,p (Ω) → W1,p (Ω) is bounded if

(4)

for some ε = ε(Ω) > 0. As a consequence, for every bounded and Lipschitz
domain Ω ⊂ R3 , there exist p = p(Ω) > 3 such that GD is well–defined
and bounded. When Ω ⊂ R2 is a bounded and Lipschitz domain, the same
conclusion holds for some p = p(Ω) > 4.
We present the following result.
Theorem 1 (well–posedness) Let d ∈ {2, 3} and Ω ⊂ Rd be an open
and bounded Lipschitz polytope. There exists ε = ε(Ω) > 0 such that, if
p ∈ (2d/(d + 1) − ε, d/(d − 1)), then, problem (3) is well–posed. In addition,
k∇ukLp (Ω) + kπkLp (Ω) . |f |kδx0 kW−1,p (Ω) ,
where the hidden constant is independent of the solution and data.

Proof We proceed on the basis of two cases.
i) d = 2. Since p′ > 2, the Sobolev embedding W01,p′ (Ω) ֒→ C(Ω) guarantees
that the forcing term hf δx0 , vi = f · v(x0 ) is well–defined and that δx0 ∈
W−1,p (Ω). Since GD is bounded when p is restricted to (4), we conclude
that problem (3) is well–posed for p ∈ (4/3 − ε, 2).
ii) d = 3. Notice that p′ > 3. Analogous arguments to the ones presented
in the previous case allow us to conclude that (3) is well–posed for p ∈
(3/2 − ε, 3/2).
⊓
⊔

This concludes the proof.

3.4 Inf–sup condition
Let us introduce the product spaces
X := W01,p (Ω) × Lp (Ω)/R,

Y := W01,p′ (Ω) × Lp′ (Ω)/R.

With these spaces at hand, we define the bilinear form c : X × Y → R by
c((w, r), (v, q)) := a(w, v) + b(v, r) − b(w, q),

k(w, r)kX k(v, q)kY

(6)

We introduce the following alternative weak formulation for problem (1):
Find (u, π) ∈ X such that
c((u, π), (v, q)) = hf δx0 , vi

∀(v, q) ∈ Y.

With the well–posedness of system (3) for p ∈ (2d/(d + 1) − ε, d/(d − 1)) at
hand, we conclude the existence of a constant β > 0 such that bilinear form
c(·, ·) satisfies the following inf–sup condition [8, Theorem 2.1 and Remark 2.1]

4 Finite element approximation
We now introduce the discrete setting in which we will operate. We first introduce some terminology and a few basic ingredients and assumptions that
will be common to all our methods.

4.1 Triangulation and finite element spaces
We consider T = {T } to be a conforming partition of Ω into closed simplices
T with size hT = diam(T ). Define hT := maxT ∈T hT . We denote by T the
collection of conforming and shape regular meshes that are refinements of an
initial mesh T0 .
Let S be the set of internal (d − 1)−dimensional interelement boundaries
S of T . For S ∈ S , we denote by hS the diameter of S. For T ∈ T , let ST
denote the subset of S which contains the sides in S which are sides of T .
We also denote by NS the subset of T that contains the two elements that
have S as a side, in other words, NS = {T + , T − }, where T + , T − ∈ T are such
that S = T + ∩ T − . For T ∈ T , we define the stars or patches associated with
an element T as
NT :=

[

T ′,

NT∗ :=

T ′ ∈T :T ∩T ′ 6=∅

[

T ′.

(8)

T ′ ∈T :ST ∩ST ′ 6=∅

For a discrete tensor valued function WT , we define the jump or interelement residual on the internal side S ∈ S , shared by the distinct elements
T + , T − ∈ NS , by JWT · νK = WT |T + · ν + + WT |T − · ν − . Here, ν + and ν −
are unit normal on S pointing towards T + and T − , respectively.

4.2 Inf–sup stable finite element spaces
We now introduce the inf–sup stable finite element spaces that will be considered in our work. Given a mesh T ∈ T, we denote by V(T ) and P(T )
the finite element spaces that approximate the velocity field and the pressure,
respectively. The following elections are popular:
(a) The mini element [16, Section 4.2.4]: Here,
V(T ) = {v T ∈ C(Ω) : v T |T ∈ [P1 (T ) ⊕ B(T )]d ∀ T ∈ T } ∩ W01,p′ (Ω),
P(T ) = {qT ∈ C(Ω) : qT |T ∈ P1 (T ) ∀ T ∈ T } ∩ Lp′ (Ω)/R,
where B(T ) denotes the space spanned by local bubble functions.
(b) The lowest order Taylor–Hood element [16, Section 4.2.5]: In this case,
V(T ) = {vT ∈ C(Ω) : v T |T ∈ [P2 (T )]d ∀ T ∈ T } ∩ W01,p′ (Ω),
p′

P(T ) = {qT ∈ C(Ω) : qT |T ∈ P1 (T ) ∀ T ∈ T } ∩ L (Ω)/R.

(9)
(10)

We observe that, for the values of p provided in the statement of Theorem 1,
we have V(T ) ⊂ W1,p′ (Ω) ⊂ W1,p (Ω) and P(T ) ⊂ Lp′ (Ω)/R ⊂ Lp (Ω)/R.
In the analysis that follows, the pair (V(T ), P(T )) will represent indistinctly both the mini element and the lowest order Taylor–Hood element. An

8

Francisco Fuica et al.

important property that these pairs of finite element spaces satisfy is the following compatibility condition: Let 1 < p < ∞ and let p′ be the conjugate of
p. Then, there exists γ > 0, independent of hT , such that
inf

sup

06=qT ∈P(T ) 06=v T ∈V(T )

b(v T , qT )
≥ γ.
k∇v T kLp (Ω) kqT kLp′ (Ω)

(11)

We refer the reader to [16, Lemma 4.20 and Lemma 4.24] for a proof.
We consider the following finite element approximation of problem (3):
Find (uT , πT ) ∈ V(T ) × P(T ) such that
a(uT , v T ) + b(v T , πT ) = hf δx0 , v T i
b(uT , qT ) = 0

∀ v T ∈ V(T ),
∀ qT ∈ P(T ).

(12)

Notice that, since V(T ) ֒→ C(Ω̄), the term hf δx0 , v T i is well–defined. In
fact hf δx0 , v T i = f · v T (x0 ). We thus conclude, in view of the compatibility
condition (11), the existence and uniqueness of a discrete solution; see [8,
Corollary 2.2].

4.3 Interpolation error estimates
For T ∈ T and v ∈ W01,p′ (Ω), with p′ > d, we define IT v as the Lagrange interpolation operator onto continuous piecewise polynomials of degree k ∈ {1, 2}
over T , that vanish on ∂Ω. We will consider k = 1 for approximation based on
mini element and k = 2 for Taylor–Hood approximation. For v ∈ W01,p′ (Ω),
we set IT v to be the Lagrange interpolation operator applied componentwise.
The following result provides interpolation error estimates.
Lemma 1 (interpolation error estimates) Let T ∈ T . If v ∈ W1,p′ (T ),
with p′ > d, then
kv − IT vkLp′ (T ) . hT k∇vkLp′ (T ) .

(13)

Let T ∈ T and S ⊂ ST . If v ∈ W1,p′ (NS ), with p′ > d, then
1−1/p′

kv − IT vkLp′ (S) . hT

k∇vkLp′ (NS ) .

(14)

Proof The estimate (13) is standard; see, for instance, [16, Theorem 1.103].
The estimate (14) follows from the scaled–trace inequality
−1/p′

kwkLp′ (S) . hT

1−1/p′

kwkLp′ (T ) + hT

k∇wkLp′ (T )

∀ w ∈ W1,p′ (T ),

which follows, for instance, from the trace identity in [29, Lemma 6.2] and
standard interpolation error estimates for the Lagrange interpolation operator
[16, Theorem 1.103]. This concludes the proof.

5 A posteriori error estimates
We begin our analysis by introducing the so–called residual. Let (u, π) ∈ X
and (uT , πT ) ∈ V(T ) × P(T ) be the solutions to problems (3) and (12),
respectively. We define the residual R := R(uT , πT , f δx0 ) ∈ Y ′ as follows:
hR, (v, q)iY ′ ×Y := hf δx0 , vi − c((uT , πT ), (v, q))

∀ (v, q) ∈ Y.

(15)

Notice that the residual depends on the approximated solution (uT , πT ) ∈
V(T ) × P(T ) and the data f and δx0 .

5.1 Error and residual
Let us define the error (eu , eπ ) := (u − uT , π − πT ). The residual and the
error are related by the following identity:
hR, (v, q)iY ′ ×Y = c((eu , eπ ), (v, q))

∀ (v, q) ∈ Y.

(16)

The next result guarantees that the residual and the error are equivalent.
Lemma 2 (equivalence result) Let (u, π) and (uT , πT ) be the solutions
to (3) and (12), respectively. If p ∈ (2d/(d + 1) − ε, d/(d − 1)), then
βk(eu , eπ )kX ≤ kRkY ′ ≤ kckk(eu , eπ )kX ,
where β > 0 is the inf–sup constant associated to the bilinear form c(·, ·), given
in (7), and kck ≥ β corresponds to the norm of c(·, ·), which is defined in (6).
Proof In view of the inf–sup condition (7) and the relation (16), we immediately arrive at
βk(eu , eπ )kX ≤

sup
(0,0)6=(v,q)∈Y

c((eu , eπ ), (v, q))
= kRkY ′ .
k(v, q)kY

On the other hand, invoking again (16), and then (6), we conclude that
kRkY ′ =

sup
(0,0)6=(v,q)∈Y

This concludes the proof.

c((eu , eπ ), (v, q))
≤ kckk(eu, eπ )kX .

5.2 A posteriori error estimators
We now introduce a posteriori error estimators for the finite element approximation (12) on the basis of the low–order inf–sup stable finite element pairs
introduced in Section 4.2.
Let T ∈ T . If x0 ∈ T is such that
(i) x0 is not a vertex of T or a midpoint of a side of T , when Taylor–Hood
approximation is considered, or
(ii) x0 is not a vertex of T , when the approximation based on the mini element
is considered, then
we define the element error indicators

ηp,T := hpT k∆uT − ∇πT kpLp (T ) + hT kJ(∇uT − Id πT ) · νKkpLp (∂T \∂Ω)
 p1
d−p(d−1)
+ kdivuT kpLp (T ) + hT
|f |p . (17)

If x0 ∈ T and (i) or (ii) do not hold, then


ηp,T := hpT k∆uT − ∇πT kpLp (T ) + hT kJ(∇uT − Id πT ) · νKkpLp (∂T \∂Ω)
 p1
+ kdivuT kpLp (T ) . (18)

If x0 ∈
/ T , then the indicator ηp,T is defined as in (18). Here, (uT , πT ) denotes
the solution to the discrete problem (12) and Id denotes the identity matrix in
Rd×d . We recall that we consider our elements T to be closed sets. Notice that,
when Taylor–Hood approximation is considered, for functions v ∈ W1,p′ (Ω),
with p′ > d, we have that (v − IT v)(x0 ) vanishes when x0 is a vertex of T or
a midpoint of a side of T . This motivates (i). Similar arguments motivate (ii);
see also the proof of Theorem 2 below.
The a posteriori error estimators are thus defined by
ηp :=

5.3 Reliability
The main objective of this section is to obtain a global reliability property for
the a posteriori error estimators ηp .
Theorem 2 (global reliability) Let p ∈ (2d/(d + 1) − ε, d/(d − 1)). Let
(u, π) ∈ W1,p (Ω) × Lp (Ω)/R be the solution to (3) and (uT , πT ) ∈ V(T ) ×
P(T ) its finite element approximation obtained as the solution to (12). Then
k(eu , eπ )kX . ηp ,

where ηp is defined as in (19). The hidden constant is independent of the solution (u, π), its finite element approximation (uT , πT ), the size of the elements
in the mesh T , and #T .
Proof We begin the proof by invoking the basic estimate βk(eu , eπ )kX ≤
kRkY ′ , which follows immediately from Lemma 2. It thus suffices to bound
kRkY ′ . To accomplish this task, we notice that, in view of definitions (15) and
(5), we have for (v, q) ∈ Y arbitrary,
hR, (v, q)iY ′ ×Y = hf δx0 , vi − a(uT , v) − b(v, πT ) + b(uT , q).
Next, we write a(uT , v), b(v, πT ), and b(uT , q) as integrals over elements
T ∈ T and utilize elementwise integration by parts to arrive at

Here, IT denotes the Lagrange interpolation operator; see Section 4.3 for
details. We must immediately mention that, since v ∈ W1,p′ (Ω), with p′ > d,
we have that W1,p′ (Ω) ֒→ C(Ω̄). Consequently, IT v is well–defined. We now
bound each term on the right–hand side of (21) separately.
We estimate I. Let T ∈ T such that x0 ∈ T . Notice that, if conditions (i)
or (ii) do not hold, then I = hf δx0 , v − IT vi = f · (v − IT v)(x0 ) vanishes.
Assume that x0 ∈ T and conditions (i) or (ii) hold. If this is the case, standard

The control of the term IIT follows from Hölder’s inequality and (13). In
fact, for T ∈ T , we have
IIT . hT k∆uT − ∇πT kLp (T ) k∇vkLp′ (T ) .
The control of the term IIIT follows from a basic application of Hölder’s
inequality: If T ∈ T , then
IIIT ≤ kdivuT kLp (T ) kqkLp′ (T ) .

We now estimate the term IVS . To accomplish this task, we first apply
Hölder’s inequality and then the estimate (14). These arguments yield, for

5.4 Efficiency
In this section we study the efficiency properties of the a posteriori error estimators ηp , defined in (19), by examining each of their contributions separately.
To accomplish this task, we will invoke standard residual estimation techniques
based in suitable bubble functions. Before proceeding with such analysis, we
introduce the following notation: for an edge/face or triangle/tetrahedron G,
let V(G) be the set of vertices of G. With this notation at hand, we define, for
T ∈ T and S ∈ S , the standard element and edge bubble functions [1, 31, 33]

v∈V(S)

respectively, where λv are the barycentric coordinates of T . We recall that NS
corresponds to the patch composed of the two elements of T sharing S.
We also introduce, inspired in [7, Section 3] and [4, Section 3], the following
bubble functions. Given T ∈ T , we define φT as

where N̊S denotes the interior of NS . We recall that the Dirac measure δx0 is
supported at x0 ∈ Ω: it can thus be supported on the interior, an edge, or a
vertex of an element T of the triangulation T .
Given S ∈ S , we introduce the continuation operator Π : L∞ (S) →
∞
L (NS ) as defined in [32, Section 3]. This operator maps polynomials onto
piecewise polynomials of the same degree. With this operator at hand, we
provide the following result.
Lemma 3 (bubble function properties) Let T ∈ T , S ∈ S , m ∈ N, and
r ∈ (1, ∞). Then, the bubble functions φT and φS introduced in (22) and (23),
respectively, satisfy

from standard arguments. If x0 ∈ T , then it follows from [12, Lemma 4.5.3]
that
kφT kWm,r (T ) . h−m

In view of the definition of φT , we invoke properties of the standard bubble
function ϕT to conclude that

⊓
⊔
We now provide local efficiency estimates for the indicator ηp,T defined in
(17)–(18).
Theorem 3 (local efficiency) Let p ∈ (2d/(d+1)−ε, d/(d−1)). Let (u, π) ∈
W1,p (Ω) × Lp (Ω)/R be the solution to (3) and (uT , πT ) ∈ V(T ) × P(T )
its finite element approximation obtained as the solution to (12). Then, for
T ∈ T , the local error indicator ηp,T , defined in (17)–(18), satisfies that

where NT is defined in (8). The hidden constant is independent of the solution
(u, π), its approximation (uT , πT ), the size of the elements in the mesh T ,
and #T .
Proof We proceed in five steps.
Step 1. Let T ∈ T . In this step we bound the term hpT k∆uT − ∇πT kLp (T )
in (17)–(18). To accomplish this task and also to simplify the presentation of
the material, we define RT := (∆uT − ∇πT )|T and ΦT := φT RT . We recall
that φT is given as in (22). Now, set v = ΦT and q = 0 in (20). This yields

|hR, (ΦT , 0)iY ′ ×Y | =
(∆uT − ∇πT ) · ΦT = kRT φT2 k2L2 (T ) .

Observe that hf δx0 , ΦT i = 0. Now, set v = ΦT and q = 0 in (16) and conclude
that hR, (ΦT , 0)iY ′ ×Y = c((eu , eπ ), (ΦT , 0)). We thus use (25) to derive
1

kRT k2L2 (T ) . kRT φT2 k2L2 (T ) . |a(eu , ΦT ) + b(ΦT , eπ )|
≤ k∇eu kLp (T ) k∇ΦT kLp′ (T ) + kdiv ΦT kLp′ (T ) keπ kLp (T ) ,

(29)

where, to obtain the last inequality, we have used Hölder’s inequality.
On the other hand, notice that
⊺

∇ΦT = ∇φT R1,T + φT ∇R1,T , . . . , ∇φT Rd,T + φT ∇Rd,T ,

where ⊺ denotes the transpose operator. We invoke the properties that φT
satisfies, which are stated in Lemma 3, and standard inverse inequalities [12,
Lemma 4.5.3] to arrive at
k∇ΦT kLp′ (T ) . k∇φT RT kLp′ (T ) + kφT ∇RT kLp′ (T )

This allows us to conclude that

(32)

Step 2. Let T ∈ T . The control of the term kdiv uT kLp (T ) in (17)–(18)
follows from the incompressibility condition div u = 0. In fact,
kdiv uT kpLp (T ) = kdiv eu kpLp (T ) . k∇eu kpLp (T ) .

Step 4. Let T ∈ T . In this step we bound the remaining term hT

in (17). If T ∩ {x0 } = ∅, then the desired estimate (28) follows directly from
(32), (33), and (35). If T ∩ {x0 } =
6 ∅, and (i) and (ii) hold, the indicator ηp,T
contains the term hTd−p(d−1) |f |p . To control this term, we invoke the smooth
function µ, whose construction we owe to [7, Section 3] and is such that
Sµ := supp(µ) ⊂ NT ,

6 A stabilized scheme
In Section 5 we have designed and analyzed a posteriori error estimators for
classical low–order inf–sup stable finite element approximations of problem (3);
the involved pairs of finite elements satisfy the compatibility condition (11),
which comes with a cost. This condition requires to increase the polynomial
degree of the discrete spaces beyond what is required for conformity. If lowest
order possible is desired, it is thus necessary to modify the discrete problem to
circumvent the need of satisfying condition (11). This gives rise to the so–called
stabilized finite element methods. Several stabilized techniques are available

Error estimates for the Stokes system with Dirac measures

17

in the literature. For an extensive review of different stabilized finite element
methods we refer the reader to [30, Part IV, Section 3], [11, Chapter 7] and
[23, Chapter 4].
We now describe the low–order stabilized schemes that we will consider in
our work. To present them, we introduce the finite element spaces
Vstab (T ) = {v T ∈ C(Ω) : v T |T ∈ P1 (T )d ∀ T ∈ T } ∩ W01,p′ (Ω),

(38)

and
Pℓ,stab (T ) = {qT ∈ Lp′ (Ω)/R : qT |T ∈ Pℓ (T ) ∀ T ∈ T },

(39)

where ℓ ∈ {0, 1}. With these spaces at hand, we propose the following stabilized finite element method: Find (uT , πT ) ∈ Vstab (T ) × Pℓ,stab (T ) such
that
a(uT , v T ) + b(v T , πT ) + s(uT , v T ) = hf δx0 , v T i ∀ v T ∈ Vstab (T ),
(40)
−b(uT , qT ) + m(πT , qT ) = 0
∀ qT ∈ Pℓ,stab (T ),
where s : Vstab (T ) × Vstab (T ) → R and m : Pℓ,stab (T ) × Pℓ,stab (T ) → R
are defined by

respectively. Here, τdiv ≥ 0, τT ≥ 0, and τS > 0 correspond to stabilization
parameters. The well–posedness of problem (40) follows from [30, Lemma 3.4,
Section 3.1], when τT > 0, and [24, Section 2.1], when τT = 0 and ℓ = 0, in
conjunction with the equivalence of norms on discrete spaces.
We must immediately notice that, in view of the stabilization terms s(·, ·)
and m(·, ·) in problem (40), the Galerkin orthogonality is no longer valid.
Instead, we have the following relation for (v T , qT ) ∈ Vstab (T ) × Pℓ,stab (T ):
hR, (v T , qT )iY ′×Y = s(uT , v T ) + m(πT , qT ).
We recall that R denotes the residual and is defined in (16). For (v T , qT ) ∈
Vstab (T ) × Pℓ,stab (T ), the previous relation can be rewritten as
0 = hf δx0 , v T i − c((uT , πT ), (v T , qT )) − s(uT , v T ) − m(πT , qT ).

(41)

We now introduce local error indicators and a posteriori error estimators.
Let T ∈ T . If x0 ∈ T is such that x0 is not a vertex of T , we define the element

1)). Let (u, π) ∈ W01,p (Ω) × Lp (Ω)/R be the solution to (3) and (uT , πT ) ∈
Vstab (T ) × Pℓ,stab (T ) its stabilized finite element approximation obtained as
the solution to (40). Then

Proof We first derive the reliability estimate (45). To accomplish this task, we
first observe, from (41), that

7 Numerical Experiments
We conduct a series of numerical examples that illustrate the performance of
the devised a posteriori error estimators. To explore the performance of the
estimators ηp , defined in (19), we consider the discrete system (12) with the
discrete spaces (9) and (10). This setting will be referred to as Taylor–Hood
approximation. The performance of the error estimators ηstab,p , defined in (44),
is explored by solving the stabilized discrete system (40) with the following
finite element setting: the discrete spaces are (38) and (39), with ℓ = 0, and
the stabilization parameters are τdiv = 0, τT = 0, and τS = 1/12. This setting
will be referred to as low–order stabilized approximation.
7.1 Implementation
All the experiments have been carried out with the help of a code that we
implemented using C++. All matrices have been assembled exactly. The right
hand sides of the assembled systems, the local indicators, and the approximation errors, are computed by a quadrature formula which is exact for polynomials of degree 19 for two dimensional domains and degree 14 for three
dimensional domains. The linear systems were solved using the multifrontal
massively parallel sparse direct solver (MUMPS) [5, 6].
For a given partition T we seek (uT , πT ) that solves the discrete system (12) or the stabilized discrete scheme (40). We thus compute the local
error indicators ηp,T or ηstab,p,T to drive the adaptive procedure described in
Algorithm 1 and compute the global error estimators ηp or ηstab,p in order
to assess the accuracy of the approximation. A sequence of adaptively refined meshes is thus generated from the initial meshes shown in Figure 1. For
Taylor–Hood approximation, the total number of degrees of freedom is Ndof :=
dim(V(T ))+dim(P(T )), where (V(T ), P(T )) is given by (9)–(10). For low–
order stabilized approximation, Ndof := dim(Vstab (T )) + dim(Pℓ,stab (T )),
where (Vstab (T ), Pℓ,stab (T )) is given by (38)–(39) with ℓ = 0. The error is
measured in the norm k(eu , eπ )kX .
In the experiments that we perform we go beyond the presented theory and
include a series of Dirac delta sources on the right–hand side of the momentum

We consider problems with homogeneous boundary conditions whose exact solutions are not known. We also consider problems with inhomogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions whose exact solutions are known. Notice that
this violates the assumption of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions
which is needed for the analysis that we have performed. In this case, we write

7.2 Taylor–Hood approximation
We perform two and three dimensional examples on convex and nonconvex
domains and with different number of source points.
Example 1 (Convex domain). We consider Ω = (0, 1)2 and
D = {(0.25, 0.25), (0.25, 0.75), (0.75, 0.25), (0.75, 0.75).
The solution (u, π) is given as in (51).
In this example we investigate the effect of varying the integrability index
p. Notice that, since problem (3) is well–posed for p ∈ (4/3 − ε, 2), the solution
(u, π) belongs to W1,p (Ω)× Lp (Ω)/R for every p < 2. In the particular setting
of Example 1, we will thus consider p ∈ {1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8}. Finally, for each
integrability index p, we compute the effectivity index Ip := ζp /k(eu , eπ )kX .
In Figures 2 and 3 we present the results obtained for Example 1. In particular, Figure 2 presents, for different values of the integrability index p ∈
{1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8}, experimental rates of convergence for ζp and k(eu , eπ )kX ,
effectivity indices Ip , and adaptively refined meshes. We observe, in subfigures
(A.1)–(D.1), optimal experimental rates of convergence for the error estimators
ζp and the total error k(eu , eπ )kX . In subfigures (A.3)–(D.3), we appreciate
the effect of varying the integrability index p on the adaptively refined meshes.
In particular, we observe that the adaptive refinement is mostly concentrated
on the points t ∈ D where the Dirac measures are supported. We also observe
that the effectivity indices Ip decrease as the index p increases; see subfigures
(A.2)–(D.2). Finally, all the effectivity indices are stabilized around values between 6 and 13. This shows the accuracy of the proposed a posteriori error
estimators ζp when used in the adaptive loop described in Algorithm 1. In
Figure 3 we present experimental rates of convergence for k(eu , eπ )kX and ζp
for uniform and adaptive refinement when p = 1.05. From subfigures (A)–(B)
we observe that the devised adaptive loop outperforms uniform refinement.
Moreover, adaptive refinement exhibits an optimal experimental rate of convergence.
Example 2 (L-shaped domain). We let Ω = (0, 1)2 \ [0.5, 1) × (0, 0.5],
p ∈ {1.05, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8}, D = {(0.25, 0.25), (0.25, 0.75), (0.75, 0.75)}, and
f (0.25,0.25) = (4, 4),

f (0.25,0.75) = (6, 6),

f (0.75,0.75) = (−4, −4).

Error estimates for the Stokes system with Dirac measures

23

In Figure 4 we report the results obtained for Example 2. We present the
finite element approximations of |uT | and πT , experimental rates of convergence for the error estimators ζp , and adaptively refined meshes. We observe,
in subfigure (A), that, for all the values of p ∈ {1.05, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8}, optimal experimental rates of convergence for the total error estimators ζp are
attained. We also observe, in the adaptively refined meshes (D)–(F), that the
refinement is being concentrated around the re–entrant corner and the source
points (p = 1.4).
Remark 1 (Influence of p on Ndof) In Figure 2, we present experimental rates
of convergence for the estimators ζp and the total error k(eu , eπ )kX for different values of the integrability index p. Notice that, each plot involves a
different range of numbers of degrees of freedom. The reported numerical results suggest that this may be due to the fact that the adaptive refinement
depends on the value of p: as p increases, the refinement is mostly performed
on the elements that are close to the Dirac measure points; see Figure 2 (A.3)–
(D.3). When p gets close to 2, after a certain number of adaptive iterations,
there are elements T ∈ T , around the singular points, such that hT ≈ 10−16 .
As a consequence, the assembly calculations reach machine precision numbers
and thus make impossible more computations within the adaptive procedure.
The same behavior is observed in Figure 4 (A), where for each value of p the
estimator ζp involves a different range of numbers of degrees of freedom.
We now present a three dimensional example with inhomogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions.
Example 3 (Convex domain). In this case we consider Ω = (0, 1)3 and
D = {(0.25, 0.25, 0.25), (0.25, 0.25, 0.75), (0.75, 0.75, 0.25), (0.75, 0.75, 0.75)}.
The solution for this example corresponds to the one described in (51).
In Figure 5 we report the results obtained for Example 3. We present, for
different values of the integrability index p ∈ {1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4}, experimental
rates of convergence for ζp and k(eu , eπ )kX and adaptively refined meshes.
We observe in subfigures (A.1)–(D.1), optimal experimental rates of convergence for the error estimators ζp and the total error k(eu , eπ )kX . In subfigures
(A.2)–(D.2), we observe the effect of varying the integrability index p on the
adaptively refined meshes. In particular, we appreciate that the adaptive refinement is mostly concentrated on the points t ∈ D where the Dirac measures
are supported.

7.3 A stabilized scheme
We perform numerical experiments for low–order stabilized approximation with
the discrete spaces (38) and (39), taking ℓ = 0, and the stabilization parameters τdiv = 0, τT = 0, and τS = 1/12.

error estimator ζstab,p is attained. On the other hand, it is clear in the adaptively refined mesh (B), that the adaptive refinement is mostly concentrated
on the points t ∈ D where the Dirac measures are supported.

7.4 Conclusions.
We present the following conclusions.
• Most of the refinement occurs near to where the Dirac measures are located. This attests to the efficiency of the devised estimators. When the
domain involves geometric singularities, refinement is also being performed
in regions that are close to them. This shows a competitive performance
of the a posteriori error estimators.
• The numerical experiments suggest that a small value of p delivers the best
results.

• In spite of the very singular nature of the problem (1), our proposed estimators are able to deliver optimal experimental rates of convergence within
an adaptive loop.
