Abstract
The breakup dynamics of a capillary bridge on a hydrophobic stripe between two hydrophilic
stripes is studied experimentally and numerically using direct numerical simulations. The capillary
bridge is formed from an evaporating water droplet wetting three neighboring stripes of a chemically
patterned surface. By considering the breakup process in a phase space representation, the breakup
dynamics can be evaluated without the uncertainty in determining the precise breakup time. The
simulations are based on the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method implemented in Free Surface 3D (FS3D).
In order to construct physically realistic initial data for the VOF simulation, Surface Evolver is
employed to calculate an initial configuration consistent with experiments. Numerical instabilities
at the contact line are reduced by a novel discretization of the Navier-slip boundary condition on
staggered grids. The breakup of the capillary bridge cannot be characterized by a unique scaling
relationship. Instead, at different stages of the breakup process different scaling exponents apply, and
the structure of the bridge undergoes a qualitative change. In the final stage of breakup, the capillary
bridge forms a liquid thread that breaks up consistently with the Rayleigh-Plateau instability.

Introduction

Wetting of patterned surfaces is omni-present in nature. The Lotus effect [3] or the fog harvesting of the
Stenocara desert beetle in the Namib Desert [45] are only two examples. Also when it comes to engineering
applications like ink-jet printing [58] or water harvesting [61], the understanding of wetting behavior on
(chemically) patterned surfaces is of crucial importance.
In the present study, the focus lies on chemically patterned striped surfaces that are wetted by water
droplets with radii of the order of magnitude of the stripe width. For such kind of systems, static
wetting behavior has been studied by using energy minimization techniques [12, 32, 42], lattice Boltzmann
simulations [34, 35] and experiments [4]. Also inertia-driven spreading [35] and the splitting [38, 51, 62]
of impinging droplets on such kind of surfaces have been investigated in some detail. When it comes to
evaporation, simulations using the phase field [59] method have been performed more recently. Hartmann
and Hardt [30] showed that an evaporating droplet wetting two hydrophilic stripes, with a hydrophobic
one in between them, is stable as long as the pressure inside the liquid forming the capillary bridge above
the hydrophobic stripe can be balanced in the liquid above the two hydrophilic stripes. This is the case
until a certain width of the capillary bridge is reached. When the width of the bridge decreases further due
to evaporation, it breaks up. While in the latter publication the focus is on the statics of an evaporating
droplet, the subject of the present article is the dynamics of the breakup process itself.

Qualitatively, this process shows similarities to the collapse of a soap film between two circular rings, as it
was investigated by Chen and Steen [11] using numerical calculations. The authors found two breakup
regimes, a d ∼ τ 2/3 -, and a d ∼ τ 2/5 -regime (with d the minimum bridge width and τ the time before
breakup), which are both dominated by the balance between capillary and inertial forces. The change in
regime is due to a geometric transition during breakup. The d ∼ τ 2/3 -scaling is a classical result for the
evolution of the minimum width d of a “free liquid bridge” (i.e. without contact to a substrate) obtained
from dimensional analysis [36]

where σ is the surface tension, ρ is the fluid density and τ = t0 − t is the time t before the bridge breaks up
at t0 . The prefactor C has been believed to be a universal constant with a value close to 1.4 for quite some
time (see, e.g., Eggers and Fontelos [19]). Assuming the prefactor to be universal with C = 0.9 ± 0.01,
Hauner et al. [31] concluded that water exhibits a dynamic surface tension, characterizing freshly created
surface sections, of σ ≈ 90 mN/m, which is significantly larger than the equilibrium value of 72 mN/m.
However, more recent studies show that C is indeed not universal. Instead, the experimentally observable
value of the prefactor may depend on the fluid and system parameters [14].
According to Li & Sprittles [40], the appropriate dimensionless number characterizing the breakup
of a free capillary bridge of a liquid is the Ohnesorge number
Oh = √

η
,
ρσR

(2)

which is the square root of the ratio of the viscous length scale η 2 /(ρσ) (with η being the dynamic
viscosity) and a characteristic length scale R. We choose the width of the hydrophobic stripe 250 µm ≤
wphob ≤ 750 µm as the characteristic length scale i.e., R = wphob . With this definition, the Ohnesorge
number for water in air for the relevant hydrophobic stripe widths lies within the range
4.3 · 10−3 ≤ Oh ≤ 7.5 · 10−3 .

(3)

Clearly, the limiting cases Oh → 0 and Oh → ∞ characterize the inviscid and viscous breakup regime,
respectively. The inviscid breakup regime is already mentioned above for the soap film. Within the
viscous regime, viscous forces play the dominant role and d scales linearly with time τ , d ∼ Kτ , with
K being a constant. In the same publication [40], a phase diagram is presented, in which, besides the
above-mentioned two regimes, also a third regime, the viscous inertial regime for intermediate values
of Oh, can be identified in the parameter space that is spanned by d and Oh. Here, as well as in the
viscous regime, d ∼ Kτ is valid but with a different constant K. Li and Sprittles [40] performed numerical
simulations for a free capillary bridge with a similar value of Oh compared to equation (3) and observed
dynamic transitions into the inviscid regime and from the inviscid into the viscous regime as the minimum
diameter of the bridge decreases approaching breakup.
Note that Chen and Steen [11] as well as Li and Sprittles [40] deal with a free capillary bridge without
substrate contact. This is not the case in the present investigation, where the capillary bridge is in
contact with the substrate. For liquids in contact with a substrate, Bostwick and Steen [5] provided a
review, where the focus lies on the stability of constrained capillary surfaces in general. The same authors
theoretically investigated the instability of static rivulets [6] and considered varicose (symmetric) and
sinuous (anti-symmetric) modes for pinned and free contact lines. For symmetric modes, they confirmed
the results by Davis [13]: For all contact angles, breakup can happen in the case of a free, i.e. unpinned,
contact line, while for pinned contact lines, contact angles must be greater than 90◦ . Other studies exist
for unpinned [9, 16] and pinned [52] contact lines, as well. In the case of anti-symmetric modes, a static
rivulet is always stable in the case of a pinned contact line and unstable only for contact angles larger
than 90◦ .
The above-mentioned articles deal with the stability of rivulets. To the best knowledge of the authors, no investigations of the breakup and dynamics of capillary bridges in contact with surfaces have
been published so far. The aim of this study is to examine the corresponding breakup dynamics and to
2

compare it to a “free” liquid bridge. A collection of the reported data is published in an open research
data repository [29].

Experimental Methods

Substrates are prepared by creating a stripe pattern of a positive photo resist (AZ 9260, MicroChemicals GmbH, Germany) on a borofloat33 glass wafer (Siegert Wafer GmbH, Germany) using standard
photolithography steps. This allows to produce covered and uncovered glass areas. After oxygen plasma
treatment, these wafers are silanized in a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition process, for which
1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (PFDTS, CAS: 78560-44-8, abcr GmbH, Germany) is used.
In the following step, the photo resist is rinsed off using acetone and isopropanol. Subsequently, the
substrate is dried in a nitrogen stream. This leads to a pattern of hydrophilic and hydrophobic stripes.
The substrates are then stored until experiments are performed. Different hydrophilic stripe widths wphil
and different ratios α of hydrophobic and hydrophilic stripe widths are used, where
α = wphob /wphil .
Experiments are performed by placing de-ionized water droplets (Milli-Q device; specific resistance 18.2
MΩ·cm at 25 ◦ C) with a pipette onto the stripe pattern. The volume is chosen in a way that two
hydrophilic stripes with one hydrophobic stripe in between them are wetted. The water then evaporates
in the lab environment (temperature ∼25 ◦ C) until a critical width of the bridge on the hydrophobic
stripe is reached. The critical width marks the transition to a configuration beyond which no stationary
wetting state of the droplet exists (see Hartmann and Hardt [30] for a discussion of the stability of the
liquid bridge). We did not control the lab humidity since the final breakup process occurs at a small time
scale which we expect to be of the order of the capillary time scale. It can be shown that the capillary
time scale is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the evaporation time scale that therefore can be
neglected in the present case (see Appendix C for more details).
The final time span (∼ 0.13 s) before breakup, i.e. the time span in which the capillary bridge on the
hydrophobic stripe decays, is recorded with a high-speed camera (Photron FASTCAM SA-1.1) in top view
mode. In order to obtain the values necessary for fixing the initial condition for the numerical simulations,
e.g. the wetted length and the contact angle on the hydrophilic stripe in the moment of breakup, a second
high-speed camera (Photron FASTCAM SA-X2) is used, which records the droplet from one side. The
cameras are synchronized via dedicated software (Photron FASTCAM Viewer) and triggered externally.
A frame rate of 75,000 frames per second (fps) is used. Each camera is connected to a macro objective
(Navitar-12X). Illumination is performed via backlight in side view and co-axially in top view using two
cold-light sources (VOLPI intra LED 5). A silicon wafer that acts as a mirror is placed below the glass
substrate in order to achieve good illumination conditions and record the breakup process at a sufficient
frame rate and magnification. We will also report results on the very last stages of bridge breakup. In
these cases, the capillary bridge is recorded in bottom view mode with the Photron camera attached to a
microscopy body. A more detailed description of this experimental setup, used materials and substrate
preparation steps can be found in a previously published article [30]. Contact angles on the silanized glass
wafers are measured using the evaporation method, in which the receding contact angle can be measured
in the constant-contact angle mode during evaporation [44].

Numerical Methods
Stationary States from Energy Minimization

To be able to simulate the process of droplet breakup, a precise geometric description of the liquid
distribution at the beginning of the simulation is indispensable. Hence, the interface geometry has to
be extracted from the experimental observations and transformed into a phase fraction field that can be
processed by Free Surface 3D (FS3D). For this purpose, a triangulated surface is produced using Surface
Evolver [8], a tool for calculating minimal surfaces by minimizing the free energy functional that, in the
present case, can be written as

FIG. 1: Initial geometry for the numerical simulations obtained from Surface Evolver (blue). Due to symmetry,
only 1/4th of the droplet is calculated. Red areas denote hydrophobic, green areas hydrophilic stripes. The wetted
length lphil , the contact angle on the hydrophilic stripe Θphil , the hydrophilic stripe width wphil and α, the ratio
between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic stripe width, are held constant during the calculation. Used values
can be found in Table 1.

subject to a prescribed volume V , contact angle Θ and wetted length on the hydrophilic stripe lphil . In
the present case, the interfacial tension between liquid and gas σlg is constant, while the specific interfacial
areas |Aj,i | can change to minimize the free energy F. The subscripts sl, sg, and lg denote solid-liquid,
solid-gas and gas-liquid, respectively. Since the droplet wets alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic
(abbreviated with phil and phob) stripes, both must be taken into account for calculating F. Note that
σsl,i − σsg,i can be substituted by Young’s equation, which is useful in the present case, because the contact
angles on i ∈ {phil, phob} can be determined experimentally.
As input data, the wetted length of the hydrophilic stripe lphil as well as the contact angle Θphil on it, as
observed in the experiments, are used. These values are summarized in Table 1. Furthermore, the contact
angle on the hydrophobic stripe Θphob is assumed to be the receding contact angle on a silanized glass
wafer. The corresponding experimental value is 102◦ . All of these three parameters are kept constant
during the whole minimization procedure. Note that at the boundary between the hydrophilic and the
hydrophobic stripe, the contact angle may lie between Θphil and Θphob . Due to symmetry considerations
and to reduce calculation time, only a quarter of a droplet is calculated, as it is indicated with blue color
in Fig. 1. For that purpose, two mirror planes are considered. Both are oriented perpendicular to each
other and to the surface itself. While one mirror plane is located parallel to the stripes in the middle of the
hydrophobic one, the other plane is oriented perpendicular to the stripes, cutting the hydrophobic bridge
in the middle along its axis. At these mirror planes, the contact angle is set to 90◦ . This means that the
liquid–gas interface meets the symmetry plane at an angle of 90◦ , which is a symmetry boundary condition.
The goal of the Surface Evolver calculations is to find the equilibrium solution of the capillary surface
that obeys the above described boundary conditions (i.e. wets both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic
stripes) and belongs to the smallest volume of liquid, which corresponds to the minimum stable liquid
bridge configuration. For that purpose an algorithm is implemented as described in the following:
1. Start calculation with a certain volume V . If this is the initial step of the droplet evolution, the
volume is V = V0 .

present work n = 7.
3. Calculate bridge width d.
4. Check for convergence. Convergence is reached when cv,7 < 10−7 . If the calculation has converged,
save V as Vstable , and decrease volume by ∆V = V0 /2 if convergence has been reached for the first
time, or by ∆V = ∆V /2 if convergence has been reached at least once, so that V = V − ∆V . Then
check if the criterion of step 6 is fulfilled. If not, continue with step 5.
5. Check for breakup. The capillary bridge is considered to be broken up if d < 0.1 · wphil . This value
is well below the critical bridge width according to Hartmann and Hardt [30]. If this criterion is
fulfilled, increase volume by ∆V = ∆V /2 so that V = V + ∆V , and check if the criterion of step 6
is fulfilled. If not, repeat steps 1 - 5.
6. Check if ∆V is smaller than 0.5 % of the last stable volume Vstable . If yes, stop the iteration.
During the evolution of the surface, the mesh is successively refined until the maximum length of each cell
edge is smaller than 1/100 · (wphil + wphob ). Convergence can only be achieved if this is true. The overall
procedure of volume variation, as described above, follows the principle of nested intervals and is similar
to a binary search algorithm. From the stopping criterion ∆V = 0.005 · Vstable it is expected that the last
found critical volume is close enough to the real value. Note that it is impossible to calculate arbitrarily
close to the real critical volume. The result of the algorithm is the triangulated surface mesh with the
smallest stable volume. This geometry is exported as a triangulated surface mesh in STL (Standard
Triangulation Language) format and subsequently transformed into a volume-fraction field for FS3D (see
Section 3.3). Note that Surface Evolver is a tool that is usually used to calculate stable minimal surfaces.
In the present case, it is used to calculate an equilibrium shape close to the onset of instability. Moreover,
from experiments it is known that before the capillary bridge becomes unstable (during evaporation),
the contact angle on the hydrophobic stripe changes within the range that is given by the advancing
and receding contact angle. In Surface Evolver, the contact angles are set to fixed values, i.e. contact
angle hysteresis is not accounted for, although it is observed in the experiments. Therefore, the initial
configuration differs from the one observed in the experiments (see Fig. 19 in Appendix B).

Continuum Mechanical Model

The continuum mechanical model is based on the incompressible two-phase Navier Stokes equations in the
sharp interface formulation. The conservation equations for momentum and mass in the bulk phases read

acceleration and the Lagrangian time-derivative is defined as
D
= ∂t + ~v · ∇ .
Dt
To simplify the model, it is assumed that no mass is transferred across the gas-liquid interface. This can
be expected to be a good approximation on the timescale of the breakup process, which is much smaller
than the evaporation timescale (see estimation in Appendix C). Together with the assumption of no slip
at the gas-liquid interface, we obtain continuity of the velocity field v, i.e.
J~v K = 0

on Σ(t),

(7)

where JψK (t, x) = limh→0+ ψ(t, x + hnΣ ) − ψ(t, x − hnΣ ) denotes the jump of a given (discontinuous)
quantity across the interface. The interfacial transmission condition for momentum in case of constant
surface tension reads
Jp1 − SK nΣ = σκnΣ

on Σ(t).

(8)

The right-hand side is the surface tension force with σ > 0 the surface tension and κ = − divΣ nΣ the
mean curvature. The motion of the interface is coupled to the bulk flow through the kinematic boundary
condition
VΣ = ~v · nΣ

on Σ(t),

where VΣ is the interface normal velocity. Formally, the latter condition can be reformulated as the
advection equation

(9)

where
(

χ(t, x) =

is the indicator function for the liquid phase. The transport equation (9) forms the basis for the Volumeof-Fluid interface capturing method (see Section 3.3). In order to regularize the moving contact line
singularity [33], the Navier slip boundary condition is applied for the velocity at the solid wall, i.e.
~v · n∂Ω = 0,

β~vk + (Sn∂Ω )k = 0

on ∂Ω \ Γ(t),

(10)

where L = η/β > 0 is the so-called slip length. For simplicity, we assume that the slip length is the same
in the liquid and in the gas phase, i.e. L = L± . The wettability of the solid is modeled through the contact
angle boundary condition
nΣ · n∂Ω = − cos θ

on Γ(t),

(11)

where the contact angle may be a function of position, modeling regions of different wettability. Here, for
simplicity, we apply a fixed contact angle in both the hydrophilic part of the boundary ∂Ωphil and the
hydrophobic part of the boundary ∂Ωphob , i.e.
(
− cos θphil on Γ(t) ∩ ∂Ωphil
nΣ · n∂Ω =
,
− cos θphob on Γ(t) ∩ ∂Ωphob
where 0 < θphil < θphob < π are constants. Note that this is a simplified model, neglecting, e.g., contact
angle hysteresis.
Note that the Navier slip condition with L > 0 modifies the singularity at the moving contact line such that it becomes
integrable and the viscous dissipation rate becomes finite. On the other hand, it has been shown mathematically that the
solution cannot be completely regular if the slip length is finite at the contact line [23].

Volume-of-Fluid Discretization

In the present study, the two-phase flow solver Free Surface 3D (FS3D), originally developed by Rieber
and Frohn [49, 50], is employed to solve the incompressible two-phase Navier Stokes equations. Here we
only discuss the most important aspects of the discretization and refer to the literature [20, 22, 24, 41, 49]
for details.
The two-phase Navier Stokes equations in the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) formulation [7] are
discretized using the finite volume approach on a fixed Cartesian grid. Within the CSF formulation, the
effect of surface tension is modeled as a singular source term in the Navier Stokes equations and the
equations (6) and (8) are replaced by

Within the geometrical Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method, the flux on the right-hand-side of (14) is approximated by means of geometrical methods. Based on a reconstructed interface geometry, the numerical
fluxes for the volume fraction are computed using an operator-splitting method [54], which decomposes
the transport problem in a series of one-dimensional transport problems along the coordinate axes. The
interface is locally reconstructed as a plane in each cell (also known as piecewise linear interface calculation
- PLIC) [48], where the Youngs method [60] is used to estimate the interface normal vector based on the
volume fraction field. At the contact line, we employ a three-dimensional variant of the Boundary Youngs
reconstruction method [24].
Within the CSF formulation, the two-phase flow is treated as a single fluid where the density ρ is
volume averaged according to
ρ = f ρl + (1 − f )ρg .
Here the subscripts l and g refer to the liquid and gas phases, respectively. The averaging of the viscosity
in interface cells involves both arithmetic and harmonic averaging [21, 56].
The time integration is based on an explicit Euler method, where the pressure-velocity coupling is
realized by Chorin’s projection method which leads to an elliptic equation for the pressure to perform a
projection onto the space of solenoidal velocity fields. Note that the grids for velocity and pressure are
staggered to enhance the stability of the method [28].
The surface tension force is discretized with the balanced CSF method introduced by Popinet [46].
A height-function representation of the interface is constructed in order to approximate the mean curvature. It has been demonstrated that this method is able to significantly reduce spurious currents at
the interface away from the boundary. Following the approach by Afkhami and Bussmann [1, 2], the
height function is also used to indirectly enforce the contact angle boundary condition. The idea is to
linearly extrapolate the height function at the contact line into a ghost cell layer, where the slope of the
extrapolated interface is determined by the prescribed contact angle. As a result, the approximated value
of the mean curvature is altered, leading to a “numerical force” that drives the interface towards the
desired contact angle. A drawback of this method is that it may create spurious currents at the contact line.

In order to ensure the stability of the numerical method, the time step is chosen according to the
stability criterion

No-slip and Navier Slip boundary conditions: To allow for a motion of the contact line, one can
either make use of the numerical slip inherent to the method or prescribe the (staggered) Navier slip
condition. The numerical slip is a property of the advection algorithm since the latter uses face-centered
values to transport the volume fraction field. In fact, the velocity boundary condition is indirectly enforced
within the finite volume method using the concept of “ghost cells”.

FIG. 3: Ghost-cell based numerical realization of the no-slip, Navier slip and staggered Navier slip boundary
conditions in FS3D (for (a) and (b) see also Gründing et al. [26]).

(i) In the classical approach, the no-slip boundary condition is enforced by extrapolating the tangential
velocity field into the layer of ghost cells next to the physical boundary, such that the tangential
velocity interpolates to zero exactly at the boundary (see Fig. 3(a)), i.e.
vghost = −v.
The velocity in the ghost cells modifies the discrete viscous forces at the solid boundary such that
the motion of the contact line is inhibited. This approach enforces the no-slip condition only in
the limit of the mesh size going to zero. Therefore, the face-centered velocity at the boundary cell
layer may be non-zero leading to a motion of the contact line. However, the extent of numerical
slip decreases with increasing mesh resolution, typically leading to a significant mesh dependence of
the solution (see, e.g, [26]). This numerical effect has been first described in the context of VOF
methods by Renardy et al. [47].
(ii) The Navier slip boundary condition is implemented following the same approach by setting a different
velocity in the ghost-cell layer, such that the tangential velocity interpolates to zero at a fixed
distance L > 0 from the physical boundary (see Fig. 3(b)), i.e.
vghost = v

2L − ∆x
.
2L + ∆x

(15)

It has been demonstrated in the literature [26, 53] that this may lead to mesh-convergent results if
the resolution of the computational mesh is well below the slip length L. However, the physically
expected slip length is on the scale of nanometers [43]. Since the macroscopic length scale of the
problem is one the mm scale, we cannot resolve the nanometer scale with the present numerical
method without massive computational costs. Moreover, note that for L > 0 the magnitude of the
“counter velocity” vghost in the ghost cell is always less than or equal to |vghost | in the case of no-slip.

8

“Staggered” slip: The goal of the “staggered slip” boundary condition, which is introduced below, is to
reduce the amount of artificial numerical slip compared to the standard implementation of the Navier slip
condition. The idea is to apply a given slip length with respect to a virtual “staggered” boundary located
in between the physical boundary and the location of the face-centered velocity nodes (see Fig. 3(c)).
Mathematically, the distance L̃ to the virtual boundary can be expressed as
L̃ = L +

ω∆x
,
2

(16)

where L is the distance to the physical boundary. Consequently, the applied ghost velocity is
vghost = v

2L̃ − ∆x(1 + ω)
,
2L̃ + ∆x(1 − ω)

ω ∈ [0, 1].

(17)

Note that here we keep L̃ fixed at the (physically) prescribed value when refining the mesh. The virtual
boundary allows to apply larger “counter velocities” in the ghost cell layer than the standard Navier slip
or no-slip conditions. Through (discrete) viscous forces this leads to a stronger damping or numerical
dissipation. The quantity ω ∈ [0, 1] is an empirical parameter that allows to control the amount of
damping (see Appendix A). For a staggered slip length L̃ smaller than ω∆x/2, the staggered slip can be
interpreted as standard Navier slip with a negative slip length, while L̃ = ω∆x/2 corresponds to L = 0
(numerical slip). Note that a small staggered slip length may lead to very small numerical timesteps since
the velocity vghost in the ghost cells may become very large. Therefore, one cannot choose arbitrary small
L̃ in practice.
In the numerical simulations of the breakup process, we observed spurious velocities at the contact
line on the hydrophilic stripe leading to capillary waves propagating along the droplet. The staggered slip
condition allows to significantly dampen these unphysical velocities at the contact line. Moreover, it is
found that the breakup dynamics of the capillary bridge is unaffected by the choice of ω; see Appendix A
for more details. Hence, the staggered slip condition only serves as a stabilization method in the present
study. Unless stated otherwise, we choose ω = 2/3 and L̃ = 500 nm in the numerical simulations. See
Appendix A and [22] for more information on the staggered slip condition and its effect on dynamic
wetting simulations.

Computing volume fractions from the surface mesh given by Surface Evolver As described
in Section 3.1, the gas-liquid interface as shown in Figure 1 has been computed as a minimal surface using
9

Surface Evolver. This tool provides the interface in the form of a triangulated surface (an STL-file) such
as the blue triangulated surface shown in Figure 4(a). The dynamic breakup simulation using the VOF
method requires the initial condition for the volume fraction defined in (13). The computation of the initial
volume fraction field f uses the triangulated surface generated by Surface Evolver as indicated by the
greyscale in the Figure 4(a). Detailed information on the algorithm used for initializing volume fractions
from surface meshes is available in [55], here we only briefly outline the algorithm. The calculation of
volume fractions from a surface mesh relies on the intersection of the surface mesh with each cell of
the background mesh, as illustrated for the 2D case in Figure 4(b). Here, the background mesh points
are indicated by circles, while squares indicate the mesh points of the STL surface. Arrows indicate
the orientation of the STL surface. Each intersected cell is decomposed into tetrahedra to simplify the
geometrical intersection, shown as triangles in Figure 4(b) in the cell with the phase-specific volume
indicated with a darker gray color. A sphere is defined for every tetrahedron in an intersected cell that
encompasses the tetrahedron, schematically shown with the dashed line. The tetrahedron centroid is its
center, and the maximal Euclidean distance from the tetrahedron centroid to its corner points is the
sphere radius. The tetrahedron sphere identifies a subset of triangles from the surface that intersects the
tetrahedron. The phase-specific volume contained within the tetrahedron (black triangle in Figure 4(b)),
for which χ = 1, is found by geometrically intersecting the tetrahedron with the triangulated surface
subset. Therefore, the total phase-specific volume of a cell is the sum of the phase-specific volumes from
all the tetrahedrons of the cell (total shaded volume in the cell in Figure 4(b)). The volume fraction is
then the ratio of the total phase-specific volume in the cell and the total cell volume. This algorithm
returns a highly accurate geometrical value of 0 < χ < 1 for the intersected cells and its accuracy depends
on the resolution of the surface mesh generated by the Surface Evolver.

FIG. 5: Setup for FS3D using symmetry conditions.

Numerical setup for FS3D: The setup for FS3D is shown in Figure 5. In order to save computational
resources, we make use of the symmetry of the problem and simulate only a quarter of the droplet, while
applying symmetry boundary conditions at the respective symmetry boundaries (x = 0 and y = 0). At
the outer boundaries of the domain (i.e., x = xmax , y = ymax and z = zmax ), we apply no-slip for the
velocity, which turns out to be irrelevant for the breakup dynamics (compared to, e.g., fixed pressure
outflow boundary conditions). The staggered Navier slip condition is applied at the solid boundary (z = 0).
The computational domain has a size of 1000 µm ×2000 µm ×500 µm in the x-, y- and z-direction and
is subdivided into an equidistant mesh of 2N × 4N × N cells, where N is varied between 48 and 128.
Therefore, the maximum resolution of the mesh is 500 µm /128 ≈ 3.9 µm in each direction. Unfortunately,
adaptive mesh-refinement is currently not available for our version of FS3D. The physical parameters
used in the numerical simulation are listed in Table 2.

Results and Discussion
Qualitative Comparison between Experiments and Numerics

Since the focus of the present study is on the dynamics of the capillary bridge on the hydrophobic stripe,
this part of the droplet is shown in more detail in Fig. 6. It shows the bridge at three different instants
in time τ before the breakup event, i.e. τ = t0 − t, where t0 is the breakup time, for both, experiment
and simulation. The geometrical parameters are wphil = 500 µm and α = 1. In the top row, the black
and dark gray regions represent the liquid (with a reflection of the light in the middle of the capillary
bridge), while the liquid is white in the bottom row. The images in both rows also show some liquid that
is wetting the hydrophilic stripes in the top and bottom part of each frame.

Qualitatively, in both experiments and simulations, the capillary bridge develops from a catenoid type to a
narrower shape. Then a liquid thread is formed that is getting constricted at two points. At τ = 0.4267 ms,
which is close to the initial condition for the simulations, the minimal width d of the capillary bridge in
both simulation and experiment is approximately the same. This is also true for smaller τ until a liquid
thread forms in the final instants before breakup at τ = 0.02667 ms, when the minimum width of the
bridge, as well as the bulge that forms in the middle, is larger in the simulations. Note that d is initially
located in the middle of the capillary bridge. After the elongated thread has formed, the position of the
minimum width moves away from the center, as indicated at τ = 0.02667 ms in Fig. 6. Below we will show
that this is the starting point of a second dynamic regime. Besides the bulge and the minimal width d,
also the length of the thread differs between experiment and simulation. The width of the capillary bridge
at the instance when it becomes unstable is of the order of 200 µm. On this length scale, unavoidable
contaminations can lead to significantly smaller contact angles than the measured receding contact angle
(see e.g. Park et al. [44] and the supplementary material of Hartmann and Hardt [30]). These phenomena
can neither be captured in the simulations nor in the calculation of the initial droplet configuration with
Surface Evolver. This might explain the deviations in the initial configuration between experiments and
simulations, for example, the slightly bigger curvature of the capillary bridge in the plane parallel to the
surface which is obvious at τ = 0.4267 ms. Also the absolute value of the parameter R, which is the
maximum width of the capillary bridge at the boundary between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic
stripe, differs slightly between experiment and simulation, though it stays constant in both.
Because not all of the influencing factors relevant in the experiments could be incorporated in the
simulations, quantitative agreement between experiments and simulations is not expected in all aspects of
the static and dynamic wetting phenomena observed. For quantitative comparison, the focus, therefore,
lies on one specific aspect, namely the breakup dynamics of the liquid bridge, i.e. the time evolution of
the narrowest section of the bridge.

4.2

Phase Space Representation of the Breakup Dynamics

Following the literature, the breakup dynamics is usually described via the minimum width d as a function
of the time τ before the breakup event, i.e. τ = t0 − t, where t0 is the breakup time. For the inviscid
breakup of a free capillary bridge, it can be shown by means of an asymptotic analysis that this function
11

follows the power law (1). However, the precise time of the breakup event is hard to determine both in
experiments (due to finite spatial and temporal resolution) and in the simulation. Note that the choice of
t0 can have a large effect on the effective exponent that is extracted from the data. It has been reported
that the same set of data appears to be represented by power laws d(τ ) ∝ τ ν with an exponent ν ranging
from 0.6 to 0.8 depending on the choice of t0 [10]. Both Li and Sprittles [40] and Deblais et al. [14]
eliminated the dependency on the breakup time by rewriting the power law (1) according to

Hence, relation (1) holds if and only if the quantity d3/2 is linear in time and, in this case, the value of C
can be found from the slope (i.e. the time derivative) of d3/2 .

FIG. 7: Breakup dynamics for different choices of the breakup time t0 for the numerical data.

In the Volume-of-Fluid simulation, the actual breakup is usually mesh-dependent since it is ultimately
performed by the interface reconstruction algorithm. Moreover, since the breakup process involves very
small length scales, it cannot be fully resolved by the numerics. Therefore, the numerical results can
only be considered meaningful down to a certain length scale determined by the computational mesh. In
the present study, this length scale is approximately 20 µm. Consequently, the breakup time cannot be
extracted from the numerics in a meaningful way without extrapolating the data.
The experimental value of the breakup time is determined from the pictures taken by the high-speed
camera. The first image where the capillary bridge is pinched off defines the time t? which is always
larger than the real breakup time t0 . Clearly, the breakup must occur between t? and the time associated
with the previous image. We estimate the breakup time to be t0 = t? − ∆t/2, where ∆t = 1.33 · 10−2 ms
follows from the frame rate of the high-speed camera which is 75,000 fps. To account for the uncertainty
in breakup time in the case of experiments, horizontal error bars with a total length of ∆t are drawn. In
the vertical direction, the error bar represents the standard deviation obtained from 5 experiments.
A concrete example for the sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to the choice of the breakup
time is given in Fig. 7. Besides the experimental results, Fig. 7(a) shows the simulation data for the
choice t0 = 0.632 ms. The latter value is found by fitting the data in the final regime d . 50 µm with
the exponent ν = 2/3. Fig. 7(b) shows the same numerical data set for a slightly smaller breakup time
t0 = 0.622 ms. In this case, the numerical data agrees well with a power law with a smaller exponent
ν ≈ 0.48, which has been obtained from the systematic phase space analysis described below. Note that
the difference between the two choices ∆t0 = 10 µs is smaller than the inverse frame rate of the high-speed
camera which is approximately ∆t = 13 µs. This example clearly shows the need for a systematic method
that does not rely on the breakup time.
Phase space representation. We apply a different approach to describe the breakup dynamics which
is independent of the choice of the breakup time and allows to identify different dynamic regimes in a
12

˙ rather than (τ, d) to describe the evolution
systematic way. The basic idea is to use the variables (d, −d)
of the minimum width. This approach was first applied by Li and Sprittles [40] and is systematically
elaborated in the following.
Given the minimum width of the capillary bridge as a function of physical time t, we consider the
breakup speed, i.e. the time derivative
V = −d˙
as a function of the minimum width itself, i.e. we formally define
˜ := −d(
˙ t̃),
V (d)

˜
t̃ := d−1 (d).

where

(19)

The latter quantity is well-defined since the minimum width d is a monotonically decreasing function
(over the time scale of the breakup process). Obviously, the function V (d) is invariant with respect to
shifts in the time coordinate. Moreover, it can be shown mathematically that the remaining information
of the function d(τ ) is still contained in V (d). Indeed, the function d(τ ) can be reconstructed from V (d)
up to a shift in time; see [22] for details.

For the material parameters of water in air (temperature T = 298 K, pressure p = 100 kPa, see Table 2),
the relations (1) and (20) for a free liquid bridge take the form

where τ = τ̂ ms and d = dˆµm. In the present paper, these relations will be referred to as “inviscid theory”.
Note that the above method requires to differentiate potentially noisy data with respect to time. This
issue has been addressed via filtering out high-frequency oscillations in the experimental values of V (d) by
locally fitting a straight line to the data (using six neighboring points). Despite this difficulty, the method
allows studying the breakup dynamics in detail without the uncertainty in choosing t0 . In the following,
we will report both V (d) and d(t0 − t) for completeness.

Quantitative Comparison between Experiments and Simulations
The case α = 1:

We first consider the case α = 1. Figure 8 compares the experimental data with numerical simulations for
θphob = 102◦ and θphil = 28◦ . Before the onset of breakup process (d & 180 µm), the bridge width in the
experiments is decreasing due to evaporation. This continues until the critical width is reached, indicated
by the starting point of the simulation curve in Fig. 8 corresponding to the configuration computed by

In the region between about 100 µm and 180 µm, the numerical results are in good quantitative agreement
with the experimental data and the inviscid theory for C ≈ 0.75. However, a careful inspection shows
that the data in this region do not exactly lie on a straight line in the double logarithmic diagram. Indeed
there is a non-vanishing curvature visible. Below approximately 100 µm, there is a transition to a second
dynamic regime that follows a power law with an exponent ν close to 0.5. This value is significantly
smaller than the one for a free capillary bridge in the inviscid regime. Note that the exponent is obtained
from fitting the numerical data in the phase space diagram, see below.

Phase space representation: Figure 9 shows the same data set in the phase space diagram. This
representation of the data allows a much more detailed study of the breakup process independent of the
breakup time. Note that the experimental data refer to three individual repetitions of the same experiment.
By considering individual experiments rather than averaged quantities, we are able to visualize detailed
features of the dynamics that might otherwise be averaged out. Moreover, note that the noise in the
experimental data for the bridge width translates to a noise in the calculated breakup speed. This explains
the oscillations in the experimental data which are not present in the numerical data.
The phase space diagram in Fig. 9 shows that the dynamics in the region 100 µm and 180 µm agrees

with the inviscid theory for C ≈ 0.75 only in an average sense. In fact, there is no clear scaling relation
in the latter region. At approximately 70 µm, the speed in the experiment reaches a local maximum of
approximately 570 µm /ms on average (indicated by the dashed horizontal line in Fig. 9) before it starts
to decrease further towards a local minimum. This behavior is also clearly visible in the numerical data.
We note that the position of the local minimum differs for different repetitions of the experiment (see
Fig. 9). Note that the simulation predicts a smaller local maximum of approximately 500 µm /ms.
Moreover, the analysis of the numerical data shows that the local minimum in the breakup speed
corresponds to the time instant in the process when the liquid filament has formed and the position
of the minimum width xmin starts to move symmetrically from the middle of the liquid bridge (x = 0)
towards the points of the final pinch-off; see Fig. 10. So, in fact, this can be understood as the starting
point of a second dynamic regime. In the experiments, this final breakup behaves slightly differently.
Though a filament has formed at the time when the breakup speed reaches a local minimum, the width
of this filament first further decreases, while the filament has approximately the same width along its
axis without any constriction point. Compared to the simulations, the location where the bridge has its
minimum starts to move in a symmetrical manner to the constriction points at a later instance in time,
i.e. for a smaller value of τ .
As can be seen from both the experimental and the numerical data in Fig. 9, the second dynamic process
is not consistent with the inviscid theory for a free capillary bridge (1). In fact, by fitting the numerical
data, the breakup velocity in the second breakup regime follows the power law

see Fig. 8. Note that the last data point (d ≈ 21 µm) from the numerical simulation in Fig. 9 has been
excluded from the fit since the breakup speed appears to reach another local maximum in this region.
Hence, the numerical data suggest that another regime transition may happen at smaller scales that
cannot be resolved with the current approach. We attribute the observed discrepancy to the inviscid
scaling law to the complex geometric configurations found in the second dynamic regime. A simple scaling
law such as (1) is only expected to work if the configuration of a system is essentially rescaled during its
time evolution. We do not expect that the scaling law to capture more complex scenarios such as a shift
of the position of the minimum width of the filament. In fact, the self-similarity of the interface shape,
which is an essential assumption for the derivation of (1) (see [36]), is lost due to the presence of the solid
substrate. Moreover, as it has been pointed out by Deblais et al., “the approach to asymptotic power
laws can be slow and may pass through one or several transient regimes before the final universal regime
is reached” [14]. Hence the exponent ν may change on smaller length scales below the resolution of the
present experiments and simulations.

The symmetry is enforced explicitly in the simulation but also observed in the experiment; see Fig. 6.

Influence of inertial forces: We vary both the liquid density ρl and the gas density ρg in the simulation
to study how inertial forces modify the breakup dynamics. Fig. 11(a) shows the breakup speed in the
phase space diagram for four different values of the liquid and gas densities, i.e.
ρl = K · 997.05 kg/m3 ,

ρg = K · 1.17 kg/m3

where

K ∈ {0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5}.

As expected, the breakup speed decreases with increasing density. Remarkably, the data can be collapsed
onto a single master curve by an appropriate nondimensionalization. Fixing a length scale L in (1) yields

Indeed, plotting the non-dimensional breakup speed V̂ = V /Vscale for

collapses the data onto a single curve; see Fig. 11(b). This indicates that the observed process is indeed
dominated by a balance of inertial and capillary forces despite the fact that the dynamics does not simply
follow the power law (1).
Mesh study: To quantify the influence of the numerical discretization, Fig. 12(a) shows numerical data
at the breakup speed for different mesh resolutions (8N 3 computational cells where N ∈ {64, 96, 128}).
Besides some oscillations in the breakup speed on the coarse mesh, the results appear to be reasonably
mesh-independent for d larger than approximately 40 µm, whereas the simulation on the coarsest mesh
(N = 48, ∆x ≈ 10.4 µm) appears to be under-resolved. The finest mesh (N = 128, ∆x ≈ 3.9 µm) delivers
reasonable results for d & 10 µm. This corresponds to only 2.5 computational cells within the bridge
width. Since mesh convergence cannot be assured on this scale, the numerical data below approximately
20 µm should not be used to draw a quantitative conclusion.

FIG. 12: Mesh and slip-length dependence study for α = 1, θphob = 102◦ and θphil = 28◦ .

Influence of slip and viscous effects: As shown in Fig. 12(b), where the staggered slip length L̃ for
ω = 2/3 is varied from 100 nm to 500 nm, the choice of the (staggered) slip length shows only a minor
influence on the breakup dynamics. This behavior is to be expected in the inviscid regime (low Oh,
here Oh = 4.7 · 10−3 ), where viscous dissipation due to slip is irrelevant for the breakup process. A
slight monotonic decrease of the breakup speed with the slip length is visible when the breakup speed
approaches the local minimum at approximately 45 µm. In all subsequent numerical simulations, we apply
a staggered slip length of 500 nm and ω = 2/3. In Appendix A it is shown that the choice of ω has no
relevant influence on the breakup dynamics. The influence of the dynamic viscosity on the dynamics in
the simulation is studied in Fig. 13(a). The green curve is computed with an 50% increased dynamic
viscosity in both the liquid and the gas phase. Despite this large increase in the viscosity, there is only a
small decrease in the breakup speed of approximately 4%. In particular, the overall shape is unchanged
including the position of the local minimum and the dynamic exponents. From this, we conclude that
viscous effects including boundary slip (see Fig. 12(b)) play no significant role in the considered range of
parameters. Instead, the process is controlled mainly by a balance of inertial and capillary forces (see also
Fig. 11).

FIG. 13: Influence of the dynamic viscosity and the hydrophobic contact angle.

Influence of the wetting conditions: The influence of the wetting conditions through the contact
angle θphob ∈ {90◦ , 102◦ , 110◦ } on the hydrophobic stripe is studied in Fig. 13(b). Note that we employed
Surface Evolver to compute individual initial liquid surfaces for each case. The results show that the
dynamics stays qualitatively similar, while the whole graph is shifted to the right with decreasing θphob .
The colored lines show fits to the second dynamic regime. Note that the difference in the exponents is
very small. The numerical values for the exponent ν and the constant c obtained from the phase space

analysis are given by
θphob = 90◦ : ν = 0.47596,

c = 179.3147 µm

θphob = 102◦ : ν = 0.47553,

c = 171.9538 µm

θphob = 110◦ : ν = 0.47623,

c = 162.5795 µm .

These values have been obtained from a least-squares fit of the data starting from the local minimum
in the breakup speed. Note that the last data point in Fig. 13(b) has been excluded from the fit for
θphob = 102◦ and θphob = 110◦ . Similarly, the last two data points have been excluded from the fit for
θphob = 90◦ . In summary, it can be concluded that the wetting condition, i.e. the contact angle on the
hydrophobic stripe, has no major influence on the breakup dynamics in the second dynamic regime.

FIG. 14: Breakup dynamics for α = 0.5. Left: Minimum bridge width as a function of time. Right: Breakup
speed as a function of the bridge width.

The breakup dynamics for α = 0.5 is shown in Fig. 14. The overall dynamics is qualitatively similar to
the case α = 1. After a short initial phase, a good quantitative agreement between the experimental data
and the numerical data is found. In the region 90 µm . d . 160 µm, the dynamics is consistent to the
prediction of the inviscid theory with C ≈ 0.77 in an averaged sense. At a bridge width of about 60 µm,
the experimental breakup speed reaches a maximum at approximately 630 µm /ms, which is captured
accurately by the numerics. For smaller bridge widths the velocity decreases until a local minimum is
reached. In the numerical data, the local minimum lies at approximately 32 µm, while the minimum in
the experiment is shifted to smaller widths (except for Exp3). After the minimum is reached, a second
dynamic regime is initiated which is similar to the one obtained for α = 1. A least-squares fit of the numerical data in the phase space representation yields the exponent ν ≈ 0.48 for the second dynamic regime.

4.3.3

The case α = 1.5

The results for α = 1.5 are displayed in Fig. 15. The dynamics of the breakup process in the simulation
is qualitatively similar to the cases α = 1 and α = 0.5. Shortly after the onset of the instability at
approximately 280 µm, the dynamics in the numerics is (on average) consistent with the inviscid theory
for C ≈ 0.75. At approximately 90 µm the breakup speed reaches a maximum before it decreases toward
a local minimum at approximately 56 µm. Below this length scale, a second dynamic regime occurs. The
observed exponent ν ≈ 0.47 is very close to the values observed for α = 1 and α = 0.5. Interestingly, the
numerical data for the breakup speed show another local maximum at d ≈ 30 µm.
In contrast to the cases α = 1 and α = 0.5, there is a significant discrepancy between experiment
and simulation at the onset of the breakup process. While the breakup process in the simulation starts
at approximately 280 µm, the onset of instability in the experiments occurs at a width of the capillary
bridge of approximately 200 µm. It appears that the whole process is shifted towards smaller values of

the bridge width compared to the numerical data. In particular, in the simulation the position of the
local minimum is significantly shifted towards larger values of the minimum width. In fact, the initial
shape of the droplet delivered by Surface Evolver shows a significant deviation from the experimentally
observed shape. Notably, there is a different curvature of the interface in the plane of the substrate for
all investigated values of α; see Fig.19 in Appendix B. In the experiments, the volume decreases due to
evaporation before the critical bridge width is reached. Consequently, the minimum width decreases and
the pressure within the capillary bridge increases. Shortly before the point of instability is reached, the
capillary system responds to the increased pressure within the bridge by increasing the curvature, and
therefore the pressure, above the hydrophilic stripes. As a consequence, the contact angle Θphil increases,
since liquid is pumped from the region of highest pressure (location of minimum bridge width) towards
the liquid reservoirs above the hydrophilic stripes (see [30]). This process cannot be captured by the
Surface Evolver simulations and, as a consequence, the initial curvature in the numerical simulations
deviates from the one in the experiments when the capillary structure reaches the point of instability.
This deviation might explain the shift in the dynamics.

4.4

Rayleigh-Plateau Instability

In Fig. 16a, the final moments of bridge breakup are shown for wphil = 500 µm and α = 1. Emerging from
a catenoid type structure, as already shown in Fig. 6, a liquid thread (a cylinder cut by a plane) with
diameter D is formed between the tips of two cones with opening angle β (τ = 0.04 ms). The thread then
gets pinched at the tips of the cones (τ = 0.013 ms) and finally breaks up, leaving a primary droplet
in the middle of the hydrophobic stripe (τ = −0.013 ms). Besides the primary droplet, some smaller
secondary droplets can be seen in the experiments. These droplets have their origin in a self-similar
breakup process. This phenomenon is also found in the breakup of a soap film that is spanned between
two circular rings [11], or in the breakup of a liquid jet [17, 37].
The described breakup process exhibits two correlated features: First of all, cones, which in the twodimensional projection appear as triangles, are formed in each experiment (at all observed values of α)
at a certain point in time. This is close to the point where a liquid thread is formed. As can be seen in
Fig. 16b, these cones have unique opening angles β for each α. Their structure is independent of the
hydrophilic stripe width. The value of β is highly reproducible between different experiments.
The liquid thread breaks up in a self-similar process. Fig. 16c shows all data of experiments performed
with a hydrophilic stripe width of 500 µm for α = 0.5 − 1.5. The diameter D of the cylindrical thread is
plotted versus the parameter λ, which is the distance between the two pinch-off points and simultaneously
the distance between the two cone tips in Fig. 16a. Note that these data points, as well as the ones
depicted in figure 16b, originate from different experiments that were performed using a microscope. This
setup has the advantage of a higher optical resolution. As a drawback, it does not allow side view imaging
of the droplet. However, the side view data is needed for the comparison of the experiments with the
simulations. Different colors are used for different α’s, and the mean values and standard deviations
for each α are represented by ellipses around black crosses. The values are compared with the classical

(27)

From Fig. 16c it can be seen that, within the experimental error, the final breakup process on the substrate
follows the classical Rayleigh-Plateau instability. The measured receding contact angle is 102◦ , which is
slightly higher than 90◦ . For the case of 90◦ a liquid jet with unpinned contact lines becomes unstable
following the classical Rayleigh-Plateau result (see, e.g., Bostwick and Steen [5, 6]). This also follows
from symmetry considerations. Remarkably, the wavelength of the fastest growing mode corresponds
to the distance between the tips of the cones and the distance between the secondary satellite droplets.
The reasonable agreement with the classical Rayleigh-Plateau theory, which is based on an inviscid fluid,
also indicates that the influence of viscous stresses that shows up in the final stages of breakup, is not
significant for the decay of the thread. The scattering of the data points of each experiment might be due
to the uncertainty in the receding contact angle. This is already discussed in Section 4.1. Furthermore, a
part of the data scatter visible in Fig. 16c is due to the spatial resolution of the camera. Since the final
breakup process occurs at a relatively small time scale (≈0.04 ms in case of wphil =500 µm and α = 1, see
Fig. 16a), a high frame rate is needed for image acquisition. Additionally, the region of interest is smaller
than 1 mm. In order to achieve a good image quality with the given light source, image acquisition is
limited to the given pixel resolution.

Conclusion

The breakup dynamics of a capillary bridge on a hydrophobic stripe, which forms during evaporation
of a droplet, was studied experimentally and numerically. The droplet wets two hydrophilic stripes,
separated by a hydrophobic stripe. Different ratios of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic stripe width
20

α were considered. By performing experiments with two synchronized high-speed cameras for α =
0.5, 1 and 1.5, the breakup dynamics of the capillary bridge could be observed simultaneously to the
contact angle change on the hydrophilic stripe. Consequently, the contact angle data could be used to calculate physically realistic initial conditions for the continuum mechanical simulations using Surface Evolver.
The data import into the numerical simulation tool Free Surface 3D (FS3D) was achieved using an
algorithm within OpenFOAM that converts the surface mesh from Surface Evolver into a volume fraction
field. The geometric Volume-of-Fluid method was employed to solve the three-dimensional two-phase
Navier Stokes equations. In order to dampen spurious currents at the contact line, the Boundary Youngs
interface reconstruction algorithm [24] was adapted to three dimensions and a modification of the Navier
Slip boundary condition was introduced (“staggered slip”).
The phase space picture of the breakup dynamics, that allows for a detailed and systematic study
of the dynamics of the process, is employed. In particular, the ambiguity related to the choice of the
breakup time t0 is removed. Two distinct regimes were observed both in the experiments and the numerical
simulations which are connected by a transition region. The initial regime follows approximately (in
an average sense) the well-known inviscid relation for a free capillary bridge, i.e. d(τ ) ∝ C(στ 2 /ρ)1/3 ,
where C is found to be 0.75 − 0.77 in both experiments and simulations. The regime transition is
characterized by a maximum in the breakup speed followed by a local minimum which corresponds
to the onset of the second dynamic regime. Within the second regime, a different exponent ν can be
determined ranging from 0.47 to 0.48 in the investigated range of scales and parameters. The latter
values differ significantly from those obtained from dimensional analysis for a free capillary bridge in the
inviscid regime. This means that either the presence of the moving contact line affects the exponent or
that the final universal regime is not yet reached. Nevertheless, it is shown that the complex dynamics
is governed by a balance of inertial and capillary forces. Viscous forces and boundary slip show only
a minor influence on the time evolution of the minimum width. Experiments and simulations show a
good quantitative agreement in terms of the breakup speed down to a bridge width of approximately 20 µm.
In both experiments and simulations, a liquid thread (a cylinder cut by a plane) is formed between two
cones. These have a well-defined opening angle that decreases with increasing α. From the experiments, it
could be inferred that the final liquid thread breaks up in a Rayleigh-Plateau type instability. Remarkably,
the wavelength of the breakup belonging to the fastest growing mode corresponds to the distance between
the tips of the cones.

A

On the Staggered Slip Boundary Condition

The staggered slip condition introduced in Section 3.3 reduces the amount of artificial numerical slip
and, thereby, is able to reduce spurious velocities at the domain boundary and at the contact line.
The method is conceptually simple, can be implemented in a single line of code and is surprisingly
effective (see below). The purpose of this section is to give some more details on the approach and its
effect on dynamic wetting simulations. A more comprehensive discussion can be found in Chapter 11 of [22].
The motivation for the adaptation of the Navier slip condition is the observation that the contact
line speed is usually over-predicted on coarse meshes. There are (at least) two reasons for this numerical
phenomenon: The first reason is that the interface in a cell located at the boundary is advected by a
face-centered velocity located at a distance ∆x/2 above the physical boundary. The latter velocity is
typically much larger than the expected velocity right at the boundary leading to an over-prediction of
the contact line speed. The second reason is that the loss of energy due to dissipation in the region close

21

to the contact line is not properly resolved on coarse meshes. This “missing dissipation” is mimicked by
the increased discrete viscous dissipation in a boundary cell caused by the increased opposite velocity in
the ghost cell resulting from the staggered slip condition. Clearly, the proposed method is somewhat ad
hoc and the results could probably be further improved by a more sophisticated numerical modeling of
the missing viscous dissipation. Nevertheless, the method is able to improve the convergence in a dynamic
wetting simulation on coarse meshes when the slip length is not resolved by the computational mesh (see
below).

Capillary rise benchmark: We examine the effect of the staggered slip boundary condition for the
numerical simulation of wetting flows based on the capillary rise problem as described in detail by Gründing
et al. [26, 27]. The latter study provides a comprehensive numerical dataset on the dynamics of the
two-dimensional capillary rise in different regimes ranging from a highly oscillatory behavior to a purely
monotonic rise towards the stationary state. Following the work by Fries and Dreyer [25] and Gründing et
al. [26], the physical parameters of the systems are varied such that different values of the non-dimensional
parameter (with R the radius of the capillary)
s

are realized. The numerical results for different values of ω and the reference data [27] in terms of the rise
height over time for the setup and parameters specified by Gründing et al. [26] for a slip length L = R/50
and Ω = 1 are shown in Fig. 17. The reference data are computed on a fine mesh resolving the slip length
and are confirmed by four different numerical methods including the present implementation of FS3D
The rise height is defined as the height of the meniscus relative to the liquid bath.
The study [26] compares the present geometrical VOF method FS3D with the algebraic VOF method interFoam, the
Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian method interTrackFoam and the level-set based extended discontinuous Galerkin method

with the standard Navier slip condition (15). For the standard Navier slip condition (ω = 0) it is found
that the reference solution is approached from above, i.e. the contact line velocity is over-estimated on
coarse grids. Conversely, the reference solution is approached from below for ω = 1, i.e. the contact line
velocity is under-estimated on coarse meshes. The error in terms of the maximum deviation of the rise
height over time is similar for ω = 0 and ω = 1; see Fig. 17(d). The error is reduced by approximately one
order of magnitude for the choice ω = 1/2.
Single-phase channel flow: Another instructive example for the validation of the boundary condition
is a single-phase flow in a two-dimensional channel driven by a prescribed pressure gradient G = −∂x p.
An analytical solution for the Navier Stokes equations with the Navier slip boundary condition is available
in this case serving as a reference for validation. In particular, one can show that the mass transport
rate across the channel is proportional to 1 + 6L/H, where H is the height of the channel. The channel
flow problem is studied with the staggered slip implementation in [22, p. 156]. It is found that the order
of convergence for the mass transport rate drops from two to one when the staggered slip condition is
applied (unless ω is chosen to be very small). Hence, the standard Navier slip condition is more accurate
in the single-phase case; see [22] for more details.
Effect on the break dynamics: It is important to note that in the present study of the breakup
dynamics of a liquid bridge, the staggered slip condition only serves the purpose of damping spurious
currents at the contact line. The choice of ω shows only a weak influence of the breakup dynamics in the
simulation; see Fig. 18. The dynamic exponents remain unchanged and a difference is visible only when
the local minimum in the velocity is approached. This behavior is consistent with the observation that
viscous effects show only a minor influence on the breakup process on the considered length scales.

In summary, the staggered slip condition is easy to implement and appears to effectively model the missing
viscous dissipation in the contact line region which is not resolved by the grid. However, the optimal value
for the free parameter ω cannot be estimated a priori. Further research is necessary to understand the
underlying mechanisms at the moving contact line more quantitatively.

Initial Condition

Figure 19 shows the initial condition for the numerical simulations generated with Surface Evolver
compared to the corresponding state of three different experiments for different α. The experimental
images shown are chosen such that the minimum width d of the capillary bridge matches the initial
condition. Obviously, the curvatures in the plane parallel to the substrate deviate between the experiments
and the deviation increases for increasing α. This is especially obvious in the quantitative comparison
between experiment and simulation for α = 1.5. In the experiments, the capillary surface adopts its shape
shortly before the final point of instability. However, Surface Evolver is not able to calculate this transient
process, since it can only be used to calculate equilibrium shapes. This final time span in the experiments,
even though it is very short, might lead to these small deviations. Nevertheless, employing Surface Evolver
appears to be the only method to compute the initial condition with reasonable effort.

being the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air and ∆cw ≈ 1 · 10−2 kg/m3 being the concentration
difference of a saturated atmosphere to the surrounding air [39]. For typical widths of the capillary bridge,

which are in the order of 100 µm, evap
≈ 105 and therefore evaporation can be neglected during breakup.
