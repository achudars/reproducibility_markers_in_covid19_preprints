Abstract
In 1973, Gauger proposed a generator-relation method and a duality theory
for two-step nilpotent Lie algebras. Based upon these, he classified two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 8. In 1999, Galitski and Timashev continued
this approach to classify two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 9. Their
results were partially improved by Ren and Zhu in 2011, Yan and Deng in 2013.
Some decomposable two-step nilpotent Lie algebras were excluded in the case
of dimension 8. In this paper, we define generating hypergraph for a two-step
nilpotent Lie algebra. The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra is decomposable if and
only if its generating hypergraph is not connected under certain bases. Using
this result, we identify some decomposable two-step nilpotent Lie algebras in
dimension 9. We give a direct proof that the five two-step nilpotent Lie algebras
for dimension 8, classified by Ren and Zhu in 2011, are all indecomposable. We
also introduce a conventional nomenclature for two-step nilpotent Lie algebras
of dimension n = 8, 9, classified by Ren, Zhu, Yan and Deng, etc.
Key words. Two-step algebras, hypergraphs, decomposable Lie algebras, indecomposable algebras, classification.

Introduction

In Lie algebra, the classification theory of semisimple Lie algebras are well-established
by Cartan, Killing and some others. On the other hand, the classification theory of
solvable or nilpotent Lie algebras are much less developed. For nilpotent Lie algebras,
there are only very few non-isomorphic nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension n ≤ 6.
Seeley [16] and Gong [6] classified nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 7. According to
[6], there are 119 classes of indecomposable nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 7 over
complex numbers, and 24 additional classes over real numbers. There are some partial
results for dimension 8. The task for classifying all nilpotent Lie algebras becomes
unrealistic when the dimension n reaches 9. For instance, according to [18], there are
24, 168 non-isomorphic 9-dimensional Lie algebras with a maximal Abelian ideal of
dimension 7. Thus, for dimension n ≥ 8, people turn their efforts to classify some
special classes of nilpotent Lie algebras.
An important class of nilpotent Lie algebras is the class of two-step nilpotent Lie
algebras. The structure of Heisenberg algebras, a special class of two-step nilpotent Lie
algebras, is well-known and simple. As Heisenberg algebras are two-step nilpotent Lie
algebras with centers of dimension 1, people considered two-step nilpotent Lie algebras
with centers of dimension p ≥ 2.
In 1973, Gauger [5] studied two-step nilpotent Lie algebras. He called them metabelian
Lie algebras, and proposed a generator-relation method and a duality theory for twostep nilpotent Lie algebras. By these, he classified two-step nilpotent Lie algebras for
n = 8, and proved that for each n ≥ 9, there are infinitely many non-isomorphic twostep nilpotent Lie algebras. In 1999, Galitski and Timashev [4] continued this approach
and classified two-step nilpotent Lie algebras for n = 9.
In 2011, Ren and Zhu [12] adopted a different approach to attack this problem. In
1971, Leger and Luks [9] showed that the related sequences of a maximal torus minimal system of generators of a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra is an invariant of that
algebra if the dimensions of the root spaces of the maximal torus are all 1. Using this
result, Ren and Zhu [12] classified 8-dimensional two-step nilpotent Lie algebras with
a 2-dimensional center. They showed that there are at most five non-isomorphic indecomposable two-step nilpotent Lie algebras in this case. On the other hand, Theorem
7.14 of [5] indicated that in the same case there are eleven non-isomorphic two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras. The difference is: Ren and Zhu [12] excluded six decomposable
two-step nilpotent Lie algebras. See Example 1 in Section 3 of this paper. It is also an
important issue to identify a given Lie algebra being decomposable or indecomposable
[17]. Hence, in a certain sense, Ren and Zhu [12] improved the result of Gauger [5] in
this case.
Yan and Deng [21], Xia and Ren [20], Wang and Ren [19], Ren and Zhu [13, 14]
2

continued the approach of Ren and Zhu [12], and classified 8-dimensional and some
9-dimensional two-step nilpotent Lie algebras. Theorem 7.22 of [5] estimated that
there are at most 42 8-dimensional non-isomorphic two-step nilpotent Lie algebras
with a 3-dimensional center. Galitski and Timashev [4] indicated there are twelve nonisomorphic two-step nilpotent Lie algebras in this case, while Yan and Deng [21] showed
that there are at most eleven non-isomorphic indecomposable two-step nilpotent Lie
algebras in this case. Yan and Deng [21] further excluded one decomposable algebra
in this case. Thus, Yan and Deng [21] also improved the results of Gauger [5], Galitski
and Timashev [4], in this case. See Example 4 in Section 3 of this paper.
In the next section, we briefly describe Gauger’s approach by the notion of free
two-step nilpotent Lie algebras [2, 8].
In Section 3, we define generating hypergraph for a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra is decomposable if and only if its generating hypergraph is not connected under certain bases. We use this property to identify some
two-step nilpotent Lie algebras being decomposable or indecomposable.
In [12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21], a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension 8 or 9 is
denoted as Nin,p , where n is the dimension of the two-step nilpotent Lie algebra, p is
the dimension of its center, i is an auxiliary index without special meanings. This
causes some confusion and is not convenient for readers. For instance, both [21] and
[14] classified two-step nilpotent Lie algebra of n = 8 and p = 3 with different methods,
and claimed that there are eleven non-isomorphic two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of
n = 8 and p = 3, and denoted them as Ni8,3 for i = 1, · · · 11. However, the two
algebras denoted as Ni8,3 for the same i in [21] and [14] are not the same. As the bases
given in [21] and [14] are also different, it is not easy for readers to identify which two
algebras in [21] and [14] are the same. Hence, in Section 4, we introduce a conventional
nomenclature for two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension n = 8, 9, classified in
[12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21]. We denote such two-step nilpotent Lie algebras as Trn,p , where
r is the rank of the two-step nilpotent Lie algebra, if there is only one non-isomorphic
two-step nilpotent Lie algebra for such a value of n, p and r. Otherwise, we denote
n,p
them as Tr,i
. In this way, the third index r has a concrete meaning as the rank is the
most important variant of a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra after n and p. The fourth
index i takes a larger value if the dimensions of some root spaces are greater than one.
When the root spaces are all of dimension one, the value of i follows the lexicographic
order of H-msg related sequences.
In doing this, we found that in several cases of [12, 13, 14, 21], where there are no
detailed proofs of the non-isomorphic property of those two-step nilpotent Lie algebras,
when their dimensions, the dimensions of their centers, their ranks, and their H-msg
related sequences are all the same. In Section 5, beside the generating hypergraph,
we define generator graph for a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra, and introduce several
3

new invariants associated with these two graphs. By using these new invariants, we
determine the values of the fourth index i when the root spaces are all of dimension
one, and the lexicographic order of H-msg related sequences is the same.
Ren and Zhu [12] showed that any indecomposable two-step nilpotent Lie algebra
of n = 8 and p = 2 is isomorphic to one of the five two-step nilpotent Lie algebras.
In Section 6, by using the tool of generating hypergraphs, we give a direct proof that
these five two-step nilpotent Lie algebras are all indecomposable. Our method can be
extended to the other cases.
Furthermore, by using the tool of generating hypergraphs, we identify some decomposable two-step nilpotent Lie algebras in dimension 9 in Section 7.
The Lie algebras studied in this paper are over the complex number field.

Free Two-Step Nilpotent Lie Algebras and Duality

As in [5], the notation A ∼
= B is for isomorphic algebras A and B. We briefly describe
Gauger’s approach by the notion of free two-step nilpotent Lie algebras [2, 8].
Suppose that {u1 , · · · , uq } is a set of generators, where q ≥ 2. Let U be the space
spanned by {u1 , · · · , uq }. Let V = Span{(ui , uj ) : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ q}. Then V is a space
of dimension q(q − 1)/2. Let N q = U ⊕ V . For any ui , uj with 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, and
vr , vs ∈ V , define
1) [ui , uj ] = (ui , uj ) = −[uj , ui ];
2) [ui , vr ] = 0 and [vr , vs ] = 0.
Then N q is a free two-step nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension q(q + 1)/2 [2, 8].
Suppose that I is a subspace of V , with dimension p. By the above properties of N q ,
I is an ideal of N q . Let N = N q /I. Then N is a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra with q
generators {xi = ui + I : 1 ≤ i ≤ q}. Denote D(N) = [N, N]. Then D(N) = C(N) is
the center of N, with dimension p̄ = q(q−1)/2−p. The dimension of N is q(q+1)/2−p.
Gauger [5] called I the relation set of N.
The following proposition is a simple form of Proposition 1.6 of [5].
Proposition 2.1 Let I, J ⊂ V . Then N q /I ∼
= N q /J if and only if there is an automorphism θ of N q such that θ(I) = J.
On the other hand, by Theorem 2.1 of [5], every two-step nilpotent Lie algebra
with q-generators is of the type N q /I, where I is a proper subspace of V . In this way,
the classification of two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of q-generators and a p̄-dimensional
center is equivalent to classification of all factor algebras N q /I with a p-dimensional
relation set I.
4

We now describe the duality theory of Gauger. Suppose that there is an inner
product defined on V . For a subspace I of V , there is an orthogonal complement
subspace I ⊥ of I in V . Let N ⊥ = N q /I ⊥ . We call N ⊥ the dual of N. By Theorem 3.2
of [5], we have the following theorem.
Theorem 2.2 (i) N ∼
= (N ⊥ )⊥ ;
(ii) N1 ∼
= N2⊥ ;
= N2 if and only if N1⊥ ∼
(iii) if dim N = q + p̄, then dim N ⊥ = q + p.
By this duality theory, the classification of two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of qgenerators and a p-dimensional center is equivalent to classification of all factor algebras
N q /I with a p-dimensional relation set I.
Hence, q and p are two most important invariants of N ⊥ , while n = q + p is the
dimension of N ⊥ . In [4], (q, p) is called the signature of N ⊥ .
For each n, the value of p has an upper limit.
Proposition 2.3 Let N be an indecomposable n-dimensional two-step nilpotent Lie
algebra, and its center have dimension p. Then

Generating Hypergraph and Decomposability of
Two-Step Nilpotent Lie Algebras

Suppose that we have a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N with q-generators X̂ =
{x1 , · · · , xq }, and a center I, with a basis Iˆ = {y1 , · · · , yp }. Let X = Span X̂. Then
N = X ⊕ I. Assume that q, p ≥ 2. The dimension of N is n = q + p.
We now define generating hypergraph G for N. The generating hypergraph G
is a bipartite hypergraph. For basic knowledge of hypergraphs, see [1]. The bipartite

[xi , xj ] =

where not all αk are zero, then G has a multi-vertex hyper-edge (xi , xj ; yk : αk 6= 0).
For each k = 1, · · · , q, we assume that there is at least one three-vertex hyper-edge
(xi , xj , yk ). Otherwise, we may always make a linear transformation of the basis of I
to reach this assumption.
Proposition 3.1 The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N is decomposable if and only if
there are bases X̂ and Iˆ such that the generating hypergraph G is not connected.
Proof Suppose that there are bases X̂ and Iˆ such that the generating hypergraph G is
not connected. Then the vertex set of G can be partitioned to two nonempty subsets
{x1 , · · · , xk , y1 , · · · , yl } and {xk+1 , · · · , xq , yl+1 , · · · , yp } such that these two vertex
sets are not connected in G. We see that N is the direct sum of two two-step nilpotent
Lie algebras N1 and N2 , where {x1 , · · · , xk } is the generator set of N1 , {y1 , · · · , yl } is
a base of the center of N1 , {xk+1 , · · · , xq } is the generator set of N2 , {yl+1 , · · · , yp } is
a base of the center of N2 .
On the other hand, suppose that N is the direct sum of two two-step nilpotent Lie
algebras N1 and N2 . Take the generator sets, and bases of the centers of N1 and N2 ,
we may have bases X̂ and Iˆ such that the generating hypergraph G formed from these
bases is not connected.

However, this property is basis-dependent. Let N be defined by [x1 , x2 ] = y1 and
[x3 , x4 ] = y2 . Then N is decomposable by this proposition. Now let x̄2 = x2 + x3 ,
x̄3 = x2 −x3 , and use x̄2 and x̄3 to replace x2 and x3 . Then N is defined by [x1 , x̄2 ] = y1 ,
[x1 , x̄3 ] = y1 , [x̄2 , x4 ] = y2 and [x4 , x̄3 ] = y2 . The resulted generating hypergraph is
connected.
This proposition provides us a tool to exclude decomposable two-step nilpotent Lie
algebras from the classification. For more knowledge about connectivity of a hypergraph, the related quantities such as algebraic connectivity and analytical connectivity,
and their computational methods, see [11].
Example 1 Theorem 7.14 of [5] claimed that every 6-generator and 2-relation twostep nilpotent Lie algebra N is isomorphic to exactly one of N 6 /Ij for j = 1, · · · , 11:
I1 = Span{[u1 , u2 ] + [u5 , u6 ], [u3 , u4 ] + [u5 , u6 ]},
I2 = Span{[u1 , u2 ] + [u3 , u4 ], [u5 , u6 ]},
I3 = Span{[u1 , u4 ] + [u2 , u3 ], [u2 , u4 ] + [u5 , u6 ]},
I4 = Span{[u1 , u4 ] + [u2 , u3 ] + [u5 , u6 ], [u2 , u4 ]},
I5 = Span{[u1 , u6 ] + [u2 , u5 ] + [u3 , u4 ], [u2 , u6 ] + [u3 , u5 ]},
I6 = Span{[u1 , u2 ], [u3 , u4 ]},
6

I7 = Span{[u1 , u4 ] + [u2 , u3 ], [u2 , u4 ]},
I8 = Span{[u1 , u2 ] + [u5 , u6 ], [u4 , u6 ]},
I9 = Span{[u5 , u6 ], [u4 , u6 ]},
I10 = Span{[u1 , u3 ] + [u4 , u6 ], [u2 , u3 ] + [u5 , u6 ]},
I11 = Span{[u2 , u6 ] + [u3 , u5 ], [u3 , u6 ] + [u4 , u5 ]}.
Here, U = {u1 , · · · , u6 } for N 6 . Now, we check I6 . Then
I6⊥ = Span{[ui , uj ] : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 6, (1, 2) 6= (i, j) 6= (3, 4)},
and
N 6 /I6⊥ = Span{x1 , · · · , x6 , y1 = [x1 , x2 ], y2 = [x3 , x4 ]}.
By Proposition 3.1, we see that N 6 /I6⊥ is decomposable. Similarly, we may conclude
that N 6 /Ij⊥ are decomposable for j = 2, 7, 8, 9, 11. By the discussion in the last section,
⊥
we see that N 6 /I10
= N28,2 and N 6 /Ij⊥ = Nj8,2 for j = 1, 3, 4, 5, where Nj8,2 for j =
1, · · · , 5, are five non-isomorphic two-step nilpotent Lie algebras given by Ren and Zhu
in [12]. In the next section, we will express Nj8,2 for j = 1, · · · , 5, explicitly. We will
make a conventional nomenclature for them in the next two sections.
Example 2 Theorem 7.12 of [5] claimed that every 4-generator and 2-relation
two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N is isomorphic to exactly one of N 4 /Ij for j = 1, 2, 3:
I1 = Span{[u1 , u2 ], [u3 , u4 ]},
I2 = Span{[u1 , u4 ] + [u2 , u3 ], [u2 , u4 ]},
I3 = Span{[u2 , u4 ], [u3 , u4 ]}.
Here, U = {u1 , · · · , u4 } for N 4 . By the discussion in the last section, we see that
N 4 /I1 = N18,4 and N 4 /I2 = N38,4 and N 4 /I3 = N28,4 , where Nj8,4 for j = 1, 2, 3, are three
non-isomorphic two-step nilpotent Lie algebras given by Yan and Deng for n = 8, p = 4
in [21]. Also see [20]. In the next section, we will express Nj8,4 for j = 1, 2, 3, explicitly,
and will make a conventional nomenclature for them.
Example 3 Theorem 5.2 of [5] claimed that every 4-generator and 1-relation twostep nilpotent Lie algebra N is isomorphic to exactly one of N 4 /Ij for j = 1, 2:
I1 = Span{[u1 , u2 ]},
I2 = Span{[u1 , u2 ] + [u3 , u4 ]}.
Here, U = {u1 , · · · , u4 } for N 4 . By the discussion in the last section, we see that
N 4 /I1 = N19,5 and N 4 /I2 = N29,5 , where Nj9,5 for j = 1, 2, are two non-isomorphic
two-step nilpotent Lie algebras given by Wang and Ren for n = 9, p = 5 in [19]. In the
7

next section, we will express Nj9,5 for j = 1, 2, explicitly, and will make a conventional
nomenclature for them.
Example 4 Theorem 7.22 of [5] said that there are at most 42 non-isomorphic nonisomorphic 5-generator, 3-relation two-step nilpotent Lie algebras. This corresponds
to the case that n = 8 and p = 3. In Tables 2 and 6 of [4], Galitski and Timashev
indicated there are only twelve non-isomorphic two-step nilpotent Lie algebras in this
case. The No. 91 algebra of Table 2 of [4] is defined by
[x1 , x4 ] = y2 , [x1 , x5 ] = y3 , [x2 , x3 ] = y1 .
Consider the generating hypergraph G of this two-step nilpotent Lie algebra. Then
the vertex set of G can be partitioned to two sets {x1 , x4 , x5 , y2 , y3 } and {x2 , x3 , y1 }.
These two vertex sets are not connected in G. Thus, by Proposition 3.1, this two-step
nilpotent Lie algebra is decomposable. Otherwise, the No. 87, 90, 78, 80, 92, 88, 75,
72, 84, 68, 62 algebras of Table 2 of [4] correspond Nj8,3 in [14] for j = 1, · · · , 11,
respectively. In the next section, we will express Nj8,3 for j = 1, · · · , 11, explicitly. We
will make a conventional nomenclature for them in the next two sections. Note that
the eleven two-step nilpotent Lie algebras in [14] are the same as the eleven two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras in [21], with different orders and expressions.

Rank, Dimension of Root Space, and H-msg Related Sequence

Assume that p ≥ 2. By (2.1), for n = 8, p = 2, 3 and 4; for n = 9, p = 2, 3, 4 and 5.
Ren and Zhu [12, 14], Xia and Ren [20], and Yan and Deng [21] made the classification
of two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 8. Wang and Ren [19], and Ren and
Zhu [13] made the classification of two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 9 with
center dimension 5 and 2.
Let N be a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra, I be its center, n, p and q be as defined
above. Assume that n ≥ 8 and p ≥ 2. Suppose that {x1 , · · · , xq } is a minimal system
of generators of N. By [12, 13, 21], the related set of xi is defined to be the set
G(xi ) = {xj : [xi , xj ] 6= 0}, the number pi = |G(xi )| is called related number of xi , the
q-tuple of integers (p1 , · · · , pq ) is called the related sequence of {x1 , · · · , xq } [3]. We
will order x1 , · · · , xq such that pi ≤ pi+1 .
Denote the set of all derivations of N by Der(N). A maximal torus H of N is a maximal Abelian subalgebra of Der(N), which consists of semi-simple linear transformation.
P
Then N can be decomposed into a direct sum of root spaces for H: N = β∈H ∗ Nβ ,
where H ∗ is the dual space of H, and
Nβ = {x ∈ N : h(x) = β(h)x, ∀h ∈ H}.
8

If H is a maximal torus on N, let ∆ = {β ∈ H ∗ : Nβ 6= 0} be the root system of N
associated with H.
For a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N, a maximal torus always exists [12]. By
Mostow’s theorem [10, Theorem 4.1], all maximal tori of a nilpotent Lie algebra have
the same dimension r. Hence, this dimension r is an invariant of the nilpotent Lie
algebra N, called the rank of N, and denoted as r = Rank(N) [7].
Let H be a maximum torus of N. A minimal system of generators consisting of
root vectors for H is called an H-msg of N [15].
A minimal system of generators is called a (p1 , · · · , pq )-msg if its related sequence
is (p1 , · · · , pq ). It is called a (p1 , · · · , pq )-H-msg if it is also an H-msg [12].
A key lemma used in [12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21] was originally from [9], see [21]. By
[9], a nilpotent Lie algebra N is called quasi-cyclic if N has a subspace U such that
N = U ⊕ U 1 ⊕ · · · , ⊕U k , where U 0 = U, U i = [U, U i−1 ]. Then a two-step Nilpotent Lie
algebra, is quasi-cyclic.
Lemma 4.1 [9] Let N be a quasi-cyclic nilpotent Lie algebra, and {x1 , · · · , xq } an
H1 -msg of N, {z1 , · · · , zq } an H2 -msg of N. Then there exists an automorphism θ of
N such that
(z1 , · · · , zq )⊤ = A (θ(x1 ), · · · , θ(yq ))⊤ ,
where (z1 , · · · , zq )⊤ is the transpose of the matrix (z1 , · · · , zq ), and A is a q × q matrix.
In particular, if for any i, the dimension of the root space associated with xi is 1, then
A is a monomial matrix (i.e., each row or each column of A has exactly one nonzero
entry).
In general, the related sequence of an H-msg is not necessarily an invariant [12].
For a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N, the related sequence (p1 , · · · , pq ) of an H-msg
is an invariant if the dimensions of all the root spaces of H are of dimension 1 by
Lemma 4.1.
We denote such two-step nilpotent Lie algebras as Trn,p, where r is the rank of the
two-step nilpotent Lie algebra, if there is only one non-isomorphic two-step nilpotent
n,p
Lie algebra for such a value of n, p and r. Otherwise, we denote them as Tr,i
. The
fourth index i takes a larger value if the dimensions of some root spaces are greater
than one. When the root spaces are all of dimension one, the value of i follows the
lexicographic order of H-msg related sequences. When the root spaces are all of dimension one, and the lexicographic order of H-msg related sequences is the same, the
value of i will be determined in the next section.
We now consider the case that n = 8.
By [12, 21], for n = 8 and p = 2, there are five possibly non-isomorphic two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras Ni8,2 for i = 1, · · · , 5.
9

The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N18,2 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = y1 , [x3 , x4 ] = y2 , [x5 , x6 ] = y1 + y2 .
It has an H-msg related sequence (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1). Its rank r is 4.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N28,2 is defined by
[x5 , x2 ] = [x6 , x1 ] = y1 , [x5 , x3 ] = [x6 , x4 ] = y2 .
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N38,2 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = [x6 , x5 ] = y1 , [x3 , x6 ] = [x5 , x4 ] = y2 .
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N48,2 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = [x3 , x6 ] = [x5 , x4 ] = y1 , [x6 , x5 ] = y2 .
Then the two-step nilpotent Lie algebras Ni8,2 for i = 2, 3, 4 have an H-msg related
sequence (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2). They also have r = 4.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N58,2 is defined by
[x1 , x6 ] = [x3 , x4 ] = [x5 , x2 ] = y1 , [x6 , x3 ] = [x4 , x5 ] = y2 .
It has an H-msg related sequence (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2). Its rank r is 3. This shows that N58,2
is not isomorphic from Ni8,2 with i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Then we denote it as T38,2 .
The dimensions of the root spaces of Ni8,2 with i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are of 1. Under
this condition, their H-msg related sequences are invariants. Since (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) ≺
(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2), N18,2 is not isomorphic from Ni8,2 with i = 2, 3, 4, and we denote it as
8,2
8,2

with i = 2, 3, 4, and do not

specify the exact value of i for each of them at this moment. In the next section, we
will show that Ni8,2 with i = 2, 3, 4 are mutually non-isomorphic and determine the
8,2
exact value of i in T4,i
with i = 2, 3, 4 for these three two-step nilpotent Lie algebras.
By [14], for n = 8 and p = 3, there are eleven possibly non-isomorphic two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras Ni8,3 for i = 1, · · · , 11.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N18,3 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = [x3 , x4 ] = y1 , [x3 , x5 ] = y2 , [x4 , x5 ] = y3 .
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N28,3 is defined by
[x1 , x5 ] = [x4 , x2 ] = y1 , [x5 , x3 ] = y2 , [x3 , x4 ] = y3 .
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N38,3 is defined by
[x5 , x3 ] = [x3 , x4 ] = y1 , [x1 , x5 ] = y2 , [x2 , x4 ] = y3 .

The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N48,3 is defined by
[x1 , x5 ] = [x3 , x4 ] = y1 , [x5 , x3 ] = y2 , [x2 , x4 ] = y3 .
Then the two-step nilpotent Lie algebras Ni8,3 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 have an H-msg related
sequence (1, 1, 2, 2, 2). By [14], they have r = 4.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N58,3 is defined by
[x1 , x4 ] = [x5 , x2 ] = y1 , [x3 , x5 ] = y2 , [x4 , x5 ] = y3 .
Then it has an H-msg related sequence (1, 1, 1, 2, 3). By [14], it has r = 4.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N88,3 is defined by
[x1 , x5 ] = [x3 , x4 ] = y1 , [x3 , x5 ] = [x2 , x4 ] = y2 , [x4 , x5 ] = y3 .
Thus it has an H-msg related sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 3). By [14], it has r = 3.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N68,3 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = [x5 , x4 ] = y1 , [x2 , x5 ] = [x4 , x3 ] = y2 , [x3 , x5 ] = y3 .
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N78,3 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = [x5 , x3 ] = y1 , [x2 , x5 ] = [x5 , x4 ] = y2 , [x3 , x4 ] = y3 .
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N98,3 is defined by
[x1 , x5 ] = [x3 , x2 ] = y1 , [x3 , x5 ] = [x2 , x4 ] = y2 , [x4 , x5 ] = y3 .
Then the two-step nilpotent Lie algebras Ni8,3 for i = 6, 7, 9 have an H-msg related
sequence (1, 2, 2, 2, 3). By [14], they also have r = 3.
8,3
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N10
is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = [x3 , x5 ] = y1 , [x2 , x3 ] = [x4 , x5 ] = y2 , [x1 , x5 ] = y3 .
Then it has an H-msg related sequence (2, 2, 2, 2, 2). By [14], it also has r = 3.
8,3
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N11
is defined by
[x1 , x5 ] = [x4 , x2 ] = y1 , [x1 , x4 ] = [x5 , x3 ] = y2 , [x4 , x5 ] = [x2 , x3 ] = y3 .
Thus it has an H-msg related sequence (2, 2, 2, 3, 3). By [14], it has r = 2. Since it is
the only one among these eleven two-step nilpotent Lie algebras with r = 2, it is not
isomorphic from Ni8,3 with i = 1, · · · , 10. Then, we denote it as T28,3 .
In [14], in the proof of Theorem 1, it was said that the dimension of the maximal
torus of N78,3 , i.e., the rank of N78,3 , is 4. This should be a typo. In fact, in the latter
11

part of the proof of Theorem 1 of [14], it was said that the dimensions of the maximal
toruses of Ni8,3 with i = 6, · · · , 10 are the same. Dr. Zaili Yan, the first author of [21],
8,3
8,3
also showed us that N78,3 of [14] is isomorphic with N11
of [21], while the rank of N11
of [21] is 3. See Section 6 for details.
The ranks of Ni8,3 for i = 1, · · · , 5 are all 4. The ranks of Nj8,3 for j = 6, · · · , 10 are
all 3. This shows that Ni8,3 and Nj8,3 are not isomorphic for any i = 1, · · · , 5 and any
j = 6, · · · , 10.
The ranks of Ni8,3 for i = 1, · · · , 5 are all 4. However, the root space of N38,3 ,
related with x3 , has dimension 2, while all the root spaces of Ni8,3 with i = 1, 2, 4, 5,
have dimension 1. This implies that N38,3 is not isomorphic from Ni8,3 with i = 1, 2, 4, 5,
8,3
and its structure is more complicated. Thus, we denote N38,3 as T4,5
.
8,3
Since all the root spaces of Ni with i = 1, 2, 4, 5, have dimension 1, their H-msg
related sequences are invariants. The H-msg related sequence of N58,3 is (1, 1, 1, 2, 3);
while the H-msg related sequence of Ni8,3 with i = 1, 2, 4 is (1, 1, 2, 2, 2). This shows
that N58,3 is not isomorphic from Ni8,3 with i = 1, 2, 4. Since (1, 1, 1, 2, 3) ≺ (1, 1, 2, 2, 2),
8,3
we denote N58,3 as T4,1
. We will show that Ni8,3 with i = 1, 2, 4 are mutually non8,3
isomorphic, and determine the value of i in T4,i
with i = 2, 3, 4 for each of them, in
the next section.
The ranks of Nj8,3 for j = 6, · · · , 10 are all 3. However, the root space of N78,3 , related
with x5 , has dimension 2, while all the root spaces of Ni8,3 with i = 6, 8, 9, 10, have
dimension 1. This implies that N78,3 is not isomorphic from Ni8,3 with i = 6, 8, 9, 10,
8,3
and its structure is more complicated. Thus, we denote N78,3 as T3,5
.
8,3
Since all the root spaces of Ni with i = 6, 8, 9, 10, have dimension 1, their H-msg
related sequences are invariants. The H-msg related sequence of N88,3 is (1, 1, 2, 3, 3).
The H-msg related sequences of Ni8,3 with i = 6, 9 are (1, 2, 2, 2, 3). The H-msg related
8,3
8,3
and any
is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2). They are different. This shows that N88,3 , N10
sequence of N10
8,3
of Ni with i = 6, 9 are mutually non-isomorphic. Since (1, 1, 2, 3, 3) ≺ (1, 2, 2, 2, 3) ≺
8,3
8,3
8,3
(2, 2, 2, 2, 2), we denote N88,3 as T3,1
, N10
as T3,4
, respectively. We will show that Ni8,3
8,3
with i = 6, 9 are mutually non-isomorphic, and determine the value of i in T3,i
with
i = 2, 3 for each of them, in the next section.
By [21], for n = 8 and p = 4, there are three possible non-isomorphic two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras Ni8,4 for i = 1, 2, 3.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N18,4 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = y1 , [x2 , x3 ] = y2 , [x3 , x4 ] = y3 , [x4 , x1 ] = y5 .
Thus it has an H-msg related sequence (2, 2, 2, 2). By [21], it has r = 4.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N28,4 is defined by
[x2 , x4 ] = y1 , [x3 , x4 ] = y2 , [x2 , x3 ] = y3 , [x1 , x4 ] = y5 .
12

Thus it has an H-msg related sequence (1, 2, 2, 3). By [21], it also has r = 4.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N38,4 is defined by
[x3 , x4 ] = y1 , [x1 , x3 ] = y2 , [x2 , x4 ] = y2 , [x1 , x4 ] = y3 , [x2 , x3 ] = y4 .
Thus it has an H-msg related sequence (2, 2, 3, 3). By [21], it has r = 3. This shows
that it is not isomorphic from N18,4 and N28,4 . We thus denote it as T38,4 .
The ranks of N18,4 and N28,4 are the same. Their root spaces are all of dimension 1.
Thus their H-msg related sequences are invariants. Since their H-msg related sequences
are different, they are not isomorphic. Since (1, 2, 2, 3) ≺ (2, 2, 2, 2), we denote N28,4 as
8,4
8,4
, respectively.
T4,1
, and N18,4 as T4,2
We now consider the case that n = 9. In the literature, for n = 9 and p ≥ 2, the
cases p = 2 and 5 are known [13, 19].
By [13], for n = 9 and p = 2, there are five possible non-isomorphic two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras Ni9,2 for i = 1, · · · , 5.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N19,2 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = [x4 , x5 ] = [x6 , x7 ] = y1 , [x3 , x7 ] = y2 .
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N29,2 is defined
[x2 , x7 ] = [x4 , x5 ] = y1 , [x1 , x3 ] = [x6 , x7 ] = y2 .
Then they have an H-msg related sequence (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2). Their rank r = 5.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N39,2 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = [x3 , x7 ] = [x5 , x6 ] = y1 , [x4 , x6 ] = [x5 , x7 ] = y2 .
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N49,2 is defined by
[x7 , x2 ] = [x4 , x5 ] = [x6 , x1 ] = y1 , [x7 , x3 ] = [x5 , x6 ] = y2 .
Thus they have an H-msg related sequence (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2). Their rank r = 4
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N59,2 is defined by
[x1 , x7 ] = [x3 , x4 ] = [x5 , x6 ] = y1 , [x7 , x3 ] = [x4 , x5 ] = [x6 , x2 ] = y2 .
Thus it has an H-msg related sequence (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1). It has rank r = 3.
Because of the difference of their ranks, N59,2 , any one of N39,2 and N49,2 , and any one
of N19,2 and N29,2 , are mutually non-isomorphic. In particular, N59,2 is not isomorphic
from the other four two-step nilpotent Lie algebras. Hence, we denote N59,2 as T39,2 .
However, the ranks and H-msg related sequences of N19,2 and N29,2 are the same,
and the ranks and H-msg related sequences of N39,2 and N49,2 are the same. Thus, we
13

cannot further distinguish them at this moment. In the next section, we will show that
N19,2 and N29,2 are not isomorphic, N39,2 and N49,2 are not isomorphic, and determine
9,2
4,2
the value of i = 1, 2 in T5,i
for N19,2 and N29,2 , and the value of i = 1, 2 in T5,i
for N39,2
and N49,2 .
By [19], for n = 9 and p = 5, there are two possible non-isomorphic two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras N19,5 and N29,5 .
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N19,5 is defined by
[x1 , x3 ] = y1 , [x1 , x4 ] = y2 , [x2 , x3 ] = y3 , [x2 , x4 ] = y4 , [x3 , x4 ] = y5 .
Then it has an H-msg related sequence (2, 2, 3, 3). We may check that its rank r = 4.
The two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N29,5 is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = y1 , [x1 , x3 ] = [x2 , x4 ] = y2 , [x1 , x4 ] = y3 , [x2 , x3 ] = y4 , [x3 , x4 ] = y5 .
Then it has an H-msg related sequence (3, 3, 3, 3). We may check that its rank r = 4
too.
The ranks of these two two-step nilpotent Lie algebras are all 4. We also see that
the dimensions of their root spaces are all 1. Thus, their H-msg related sequences are
invariants. Since (2, 2, 3, 3) ≺ (3, 3, 3, 3), they are not isomorphic. We denote denoted
9,5
9,5
N19,5 as T4,1
, and N29,5 as T4,2
, respectively.

Generator Graph and Some New Invariants

In the last section, there are five cases, where the non-isomorphic property is not
established and the value of the fourth index i is undetermined. In this section, by
introducing more new invariants, we complete the non-isomorphic property proof, and
determine the values of the fourth index i in our nomenclature.
Recall the generating hypergraph G for a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N, defined
in Section 3. We assume that the basis of I is chosen such that the sum of the sizes of the
hyper-edges of G is minimized. This assumption is important, otherwise center related
sequence and weighted center related sequence introduced below may not be invariants.
In the following cases, the generating graphs involved are all 3-uniform hypergraphs,
i.e., each hyper-edge has exactly three vertices xi , xj , yk . Then this assumption is
satisfied.
From G, we further define an ordinary graph Ĝ, called the generator graph of N,
The vertex set of Ĝ is X̂. If the Lie bracket operation [xi , xj ] is defined, then (xi , xj )
is an edge of Ĝ. The generating graph G and the generator graph Ĝ will be helpful
to calculate the related sequence, the related index, and some new invariants we will
introduce below.
14

We now study the case that n = 8 and p = 2. In that case, the value of the fourth
8,2
index i in our nomenclature is undetermined for T4,i
with i = 1, 2, 3, where the H-msg
related sequences are the same. By our discussion in the last section, the candidates
8,2
for T4,i
with i = 1, 2, 3 are Ni8,2 with i = 2, 3, 4 in [12].
In [12], the five two-step nilpotent Lie algebras Ni8,2 with i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are claimed
to be mutually non-isomorphic by citing a lemma (Lemma 5 of [12]) that if the dimensions of all the root spaces are 1, then the Lie bracket relations are reserved except
some index exchanges and scalings. This implies that the H-msg related sequences
are invariants under this condition. However, for Ni8,2 with i = 2, 3, 4, the H-msg
related sequences are the same. How can we distinguish them quantitatively? We now
introduce two more new invariants.
First, we put the dimensions of the components of the generator graph Ĝ in the
nondecreasing order to make a sequence, and call it the generator relation sequence.
Under the condition of Lemma 5 of [12], this sequence is clearly an invariant. Now, the
generator relation sequences of Ni8,2 with i = 2, 3, 4 in [12] are (3, 3), (2, 4) and (2, 4),
respectively. This shows that N28,2 are non-isomorphic from Ni8,2 with i = 3, 4.
Second, for each element of the center I, we count the number of its related Lie
bracket operations, and put them in the nondecreasing order. We call this sequence
the center related sequence. By definition, we may use the generating graph G to
calculate this sequence. Under the condition of Lemma 4.1 and the condition that G
is a 3-uniform hypergraph, this sequence is also an invariant. Now, the center related
sequences of Ni8,2 with i = 2, 3, 4 in [12] are (2, 2), (2, 2) and (1, 3), respectively. This
shows that N48,2 are non-isomorphic from Ni8,2 with i = 2, 3.
Then we have the following theorem.
Theorem 5.1 The five two-step nilpotent Lie algebras Ni8,2 for i = 1, · · · , 5 in the last
section, are mutually non-isomorphic.
This proves the corresponding result of [12], quantitatively.
8,2
Now, we determine which of Ni8,2 for i = 2, 3, 4 should be assigned as T4,i
for
i = 2, 3, 4, respectively. Since their H-msg related sequences are the same, we now
follow the lexicographic order of their generator relation sequence first, then follow
the lexicographic order of their center related sequence. Hence, we denote Ti8,2 for
8,2
i = 4, 3, 2, as N4,i
for i = 2, 3, 4, respectively. This totally solves the nomenclature
problem for n = 8 and p = 2.
The case that n = 9 and p = 2 can be treated similarly.
Theorem 5.2 The five two-step nilpotent Lie algebras Ni9,2 for i = 1, · · · , 5 in the last
section, are mutually non-isomorphic.
15

Proof They all satisfies the condition of Lemma 4.1, i.e., Lemma 2.3 of [12]. The H-msg
related sequences of Ni9,2 for i = 1, 2 are (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2). The center related sequence
for N19,2 is (1, 3). The center related sequence for N29,2 is (2, 2). The H-msg related
sequences of Ni9,2 for i = 3, 4, are (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2). The generator relation sequence
of N39,2 is (2, 5). The generator relation sequence of N49,2 is (3, 4). The H-msg related
sequence of N59,2 is (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2). The invariants of any two of them are different.
Hence, these five two-step nilpotent Lie algebras are mutually non-isomorphic.

The generator relation sequences of Ni9,2 for i = 1, 2 are the same as (2, 2, 3).
The center related sequence for N19,2 is (1, 3), which precedes (2, 2), the center related
9,2
9,2
. The generator relation
and N29,2 as T5,2
sequence for N29,2 . Thus we denote N19,2 as T5,1
9,2
sequence for N3 is (2, 5), which precedes (3, 4), the generator relation sequence for
9,2
9,2
. This completes the nomenclature
and N49,2 as T4,2
N49,2 . Thus we denote N39,2 as T4,1
task for n = 9 and p = 2.
We now study the case that n = 8 and p = 3.
In the last section, we see that for Ni8,3 with i = 1, 2, 4, their ranks are all 4, all
the root spaces have dimension 1, and their H-msg related sequences are all the same.
We now need to show that Ni8,3 with i = 1, 2, 4 are mutually non-isomorphic, and
8,3
determine the values of i precisely in T4,i
with i = 2, 3, 4 for them. The generator
relation sequence of N18,3 is (2, 3), while the generator relation sequence of N28,3 and
N48,3 are (5). Thus, N18,3 is not isomorphic from N28,3 and N48,3 , and we may denote it
8,3
as T4,2
, as (2, 5) ≺ (5).
However, the center related sequences of N28,3 and N48,3 are the same as (1, 1, 2).
Hence, a new invariant is needed to distinguish them. Hence, we now define weighted
center related sequence for a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra N, Assume that the generating graph G is a 3-uniform hypergraph, i.e., the Lie bracket operations which define
N all have the form [xi , xj ] = yk . This assumption is satisfied by Ni8,3 for i = 1, · · · , 11.
For each i = 1, · · · , q, xi is a vertex of the generator graph Ĝ. Denote the degree of xi
as a vertex in Ĝ as d(xj ). For each k = 1, · · · , p, let
w(yk ) =

X

{dxi : (xi , xj , yk ) is a hyper-edge of G} .

We put these numbers in the nondecreasing order as a sequence, and call them the
weighted center related sequence of N. Under the condition of Lemma 5 of [12],
i.e., Lemma 3 of [14], and the 3-uniform hypergraph assumption, this sequence is also
an invariant of N, and we may use its lexicographic order to determine the value i in
n,p
Tr,i
, if the generator relation sequence and center related sequence have already been
used. Now the weighted center related sequence of N28,3 is (4, 4, 6), while the weighted
center related sequence of N48,3 is (3, 4, 7). Thus, N28,3 and N48,3 are not isomorphic.
8,3
8,3
Since (3, 4, 7) ≺ (4, 4, 6), we denote N48,3 as T4,3
, and N28,3 as T4,4
.
16

Finally, we study the case of Ni8,3 with i = 6, 9. We found that the generator
relation sequences, the center related sequences, the weighted center related sequences
of these two two-step nilpotent Lie algebras are all the same. However, the generator
graph Ĝ of N68,3 has a cycle of three, while the generator graph Ĝ of N98,3 has a cycle of
four. Thus, they are not isomorphic, and N98,3 is more complicated in a certain sense.
8,3
8,3
Thus, we may denote N68,3 as T3,2
, and N98,3 as T3,3
. This completes our nomenclature,
and we have the following theorem.
Theorem 5.3 The eleven two-step nilpotent Lie algebras Ni8,3 for i = 1, · · · , 11 in the
last section, are mutually non-isomorphic.

Identifying Some Indecomposable Two-Step Nilpotent Lie Algebras in Dimension 8

In this section, we identify some two-step nilpotent Lie algebras in dimension 8 being
indecomposable. The tool of generating hypergraphs is used in the proof of Lemma
6.3.
Given a two-step Lie algebra N with q-generators and a center of dimension p,
and a corresponding basis (X, I) with X = {x1 , . . . , xq } and I = {y1 , . . . , yp }, we can
associate it a third order tensor A(X, I) = (aijk ) of dimension q × q × p with the entries

basis (X, I).
Given a triple of matrices (A, B, C) ∈ Cp×q × Cr×s × Cu×v , we have an action of
(A, B, C) on a given tensor A ∈ Cq×s×v defined entry-wisely by

Proof Let ti be the i-th column of T . We have

Thus, with E being the identity matrix of appropriate dimension,
(T T , T T , E) · A(Ẑ) = (E, E, T ) · A(Z).
By the nonsingularity of the matrix T and the associativity of the action on the tensors
defined above, we have that

A(Ẑ) = (T −T , T −T, E) · (T T , T T, E) · A(Ẑ)

= (T −T , T −T, E) · (E, E, T ) · A(Z)
= (T −T , T −T, T ) · A(Z).

The conclusion then follows.

{1, . . . , q} and T ⊆ {1, . . . , p} if the only possible nonzero entries of A occur at
(i, j, k) ∈ S × S × T ∪ S ∁ × S ∁ × T ∁ .
Lemma 6.3 Let all notation be as above. Then the Lie algebra N is decomposable
if and only if there is a basis (X, I) such that the representation tensor A(X, I) is in
block diagonal format (S, T ) for some nonempty proper subset S ⊂ {1, . . . , q}.
Proof In this case, the generating hypergraph of N has two disconnected parts, induced
by the vertex sets S ∪ T and S ∁ ∪ T ∁ . Thus, by Proposition 3.1, the conclusion follows.

The decomposable case with a nonempty proper subset S ⊂ {1, . . . , q} and T =
{1, . . . , p} can be identified easily.
Let Ai := (a··i ) ∈ Cq×q be the i-th slice matrix of the tensor A(X, I) for all i ∈
{1, . . . , q}. The rank of the matrix [A1 , . . . , Ap ] ∈ Cq×pq is called the marginal rank of
N. Since the representation tensor is changed along the bases change by the rule in
Lemma 6.2, obviously, the marginal rank is an intrinsic quantity which is independent
of bases.
Lemma 6.4 Let all notation be as above. There is a basis (X, I) such that the representation tensor A(X, I) is in block diagonal format (S, T ) for some nonempty proper
subset S ⊂ {1, . . . , q} and T = {1, . . . , p} if and only if the marginal rank of N is
strictly smaller than q. In this case, the Lie algebra N is a direct sum of N s+p,p and
q − s copies of N 1 , and hence decomposable.
Proof For the necessity, under this basis, the matrix [A1 , . . . , Ap ] has only nonzero
entries in the rows indexed by the set S. Thus, the marginal rank is obviously not
greater than |S| < q.
For the sufficiency, if the marginal rank is not greater than a positive number s < q,
there is an invertible matrix Q such that Q[A1 , . . . , Ap ] has only nonzero entries in the
rows indexed by a proper nonempty subset S of {1, . . . , q} with cardinality |S| ≤ s.
Also note that each Ai is skew-symmetric by the skew-symmetry of the Lie bracket.
19

Therefore, QAi QT is also skew-symmetric. Since QAi has zero rows indexed by S ∁ ,
we have that QAi QT also has zero columns indexed by S ∁ . On the other hand, the
i-th slice of the tensor (Q, Q, E) · A(X, I) is exactly QAi QT for all i ∈ {1, . . . , p}.
Consequently, the tensor (Q, Q, E) · A(X, I) has the desired block diagonal format. 
Block diagonal formats as in Lemma 6.4 are called trivial. The block diagonal
formats with nonempty proper subsets T ⊂ {1, . . . , p} are nontrivial.
Lemma 6.5 Let p = 2 and the marginal rank of N be q. Let A··i ∈ Cq×q be the matrix
slice of A by fixing the third index to i for i = 1, 2. Then, if
rank(A··1) + rank(A··2) > q,

(6.3)

then A cannot be block diagonal format (S, T ) for any nonempty proper subset S ⊂
{1, . . . , q}. Therefore, if (6.3) is satisfied for all the representation tensor of the Lie
algebra N, then N is indecomposable.
Proof By Lemma 6.4, only nontrivial block diagonal format with nonempty proper
subset T ⊂ {1, 2} is possible. The rest follows from the definitions.

Lemma 6.6 Let p = 2 and the marginal rank of N be q, A = A··1 and B = A··2 for a
representation tensor. If
rank(c11 A + c12 B) + rank(c21 A + c22 B) > q

(6.4)

for all nonsingular matrix C ∈ C2×2 , then the Lie algebra N is indecomposable.
ˆ be another basis of N. Let S ∈ Cq×q be the basis change matrix
Proof Let (X̂, I)
ˆ It follows from Lemma 6.2 that
from X to X̂, and C be that from I to I.
ˆ = (S −T , S −T, C) · A(X, I).
A(X̂, I)
ˆ We have that
Let Â, B̂ be the slice matrices of A(X̂, I).
Â = S −T (c11 A + c12 B)S −1 and B̂ = S −T (c21 A + c22 B)S −1 .
Since S is nonsingular, we have that
rank(Â) = rank(c11 A + c12 B) and rank(B̂) = rank(c21 A + c22 B).


The result then follows from Lemma 6.5.

It is easy to see that the marginal rank is q = 6. Then by Lemma 6.4, it cannot be
written as a direct sum of N s,2 and 8 − s copies of N 1 . In the following, we consider
nontrivial block diagonal formats. Obviously, rank(A) = 4 and rank(B) = 4. Moreover,
rank(A + γB) ≥ 6 and rank(τ A + B) ≥ 6
for any nonzero γ and τ . By Lemma 6.6, N18,2 is indecomposable.

Identifying Some Decomposable Two-Step Nilpotent Lie Algebras in Dimension 9

For n = 9 and p = 4, Table 2 of Galitski and Timashev [4] listed 35 non-isomorphic
two-step nilpotent Lie algebras. The No. 82 algebra is defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = y2 , [x1 , x3 ] = y3 , [x2 , x3 ] = y4 , [x4 , x5 ] = y1 .
The vertex set of the generating hypergraph G of this two-step nilpotent Lie algebra
can be partitioned into two parts {x1 , x2 , x3 , y2 , y3 , y4 } and {x4 , x5 , y1 }, which are not
connected. By Proposition 3.1, this two-step nilpotent Lie algebra is decomposable.
Galitski and Timashev [4] indicated that for n = 9 and p = 4, there are seven
families of non-isomorphic two-step nilpotent Lie algebras. Each of the first three
families depends on two parameters. The fourth, fifth and sixth families contain 6, 6
and 15 algebras respectively. In Table 8 of [4], 44 non-isomorphic two-step nilpotent
Lie algebras of n = 9 and p = 4 were listed. The No. 44 algebra of Table 8 of [4], is
defined by
[x1 , x2 ] = y3 , [x1 , x5 ] = y1 , [x2 , x6 ] = y1 , [x3 , x4 ] = y2 .
The vertex set of the generating hypergraph G of this two-step nilpotent Lie algebra
can be partitioned into two parts {x1 , x2 , x5 , x6 , y1 , y3 } and {x3 , x4 , y2 }, which are not
connected. By Proposition 3.1, this two-step nilpotent Lie algebra is decomposable.
It will be a challenging work to identify which of the remaining two-step nilpotent
Lie algebras in these two cases are indecomposable.
