Abstract
The radicals HCO and CH3 on carbon monoxide ice surfaces were simulated using
density functional theory. Their binding energy on amorphous CO ice shows broad distributions, with approximative average values of 500 K for HCO and 200 K for CH3 .
If they are located on the surface close to each other (3 to 4 Å), molecular dynamics
calculations based on density functional theory show that they can form acetaldehyde
(CH3 CHO) or CH4 + CO in barrier-less reactions, depending on the initial orientation
of the molecules with respect to each other. In some orientations, no spontaneous
reactions were found, the products remained bound to the surface. Sufficient configurational sampling, inclusion of the vibrational zero point energy, and a thorough
benchmark of the applied electronic structure method are important to predict reliable
binding energies for such weakly interacting systems. From these results it is clear
that complex organic molecules, like acetaldehyde, can be formed by recombination
reactions of radicals on CO surfaces.

Introduction
Acetaldehyde is a major precursor for several complex organic molecules (COMs) in astrochemical surface reactions. It has first been detected in the interstellar medium in the 70’s
of the previous century 1–3 and thereafter it has also been detected in other cold clouds,
TMC-1 and L134N, 4 translucent clouds 5–7 and pre-stellar cores. 8,9 In CO rich ices on the
surfaces of dust grains, the direct hydrogenation of CO leads to the closed-shell molecules
formaldehyde and methanol. En route to these, radicals such as HCO are formed. Larger
molecules that exhibit an additional C–C bond are believed to be formed, at least partially,
by radical-radical recombination reactions at low temperatures. 10,11 In other words, when
two radicals find each other it is often assumed that a barrier-less reaction can take place
leading to the formation of larger closed-shell molecules. Radicals can encounter each other
either via creation in the ice next to each other, 12 via thermally induced diffusion 10 or via
hot diffusion following reaction. 13 The radical-radical recombination of HCO and CH3 can
lead to acetaldehyde, but can also lead to CH4 + CO, i.e., no formation of a new C–C bond.
For the similar reaction HCO + NH2 on a water ice surface it was recently shown that the
outcome depends on the orientation of the radicals with respect to each other. 14
The solid-state formation of acetaldehyde has experimentally been confirmed following
UV-irradiation of methanol ices, 15,16 albeit in low quantities. One possible reaction mechanism is through the C–C bond formation via a reaction between CH3 and HCO radicals. This
reaction, however, can also take place without additional energetic input of UV-irradiation,
as long as both radicals are available. This may indeed be the case during the later stages
of the cold dense clouds, when more CO is available and hydrogenation of carbon monoxide
results in HCO formation. In either case, methanol photodissociation or non-energetic pro-

2

cessing, such a reaction is expected to take place in an ice matrix that is no longer water
dominated. 17
In this work we show that in a CO-rich environment indeed the formation of acetaldehyde
from HCO and CH3 is possible. However, when these radicals meet, another product channel
leading to CH4 + CO is also open. Furthermore, we show that the outcome depends on the
relative orientation of the two radicals with respect to each other. This is the first ab initio
computational study of a radical-radical reaction on a CO ice cluster. As such this is also a
comment on the importance of taking into account other ice constituents than only H2 O.

Methodology
The methods to simulate the radical-radical reaction are comprised of three steps: 1) the
construction of a CO cluster, 2) the determination of HCO and CH3 binding sites and corresponding binding energies, and 3) the direct simulation of the radical-radical surface reactions
HCO + CH3 . For all calculations density functional theory (DFT) has been used within the
program ChemShell. 18,19 Both molecular dynamics (MD) runs and geometry optimizations
were carried out within this framework. Geometry optimizations were performed with the
DL-find library. 20 The PBEh-3c functional in combination with the def2-mSVP basis set 21 in
turbomole 22 are used for all MD runs as well as for the geometry optimizations. Refinements
of the binding sites and binding energies are also calculated with the M06-2X functional 23
and def2-TZVPD basis set 24,25 including a Grimme’s D3 correction. 26 Finally we provide a
small benchmark study at the CCSD(T)-F12/VTZ-F12 level of theory 27–31 using molpro 32
to get a feeling for the error bar on the binding energies.

Construction of the CO cluster
A cluster consisting of 17 CO molecules was prepared using Avogadro 33 and subsequently
relaxed via a short ab initio MD run at the PBEh-3c/mSVP level of theory, followed by

geometry optimization. In this way, an amorphous ellipsoidal structure of approximately
12 × 8 × 8 Å3 is obtained, allowing for a variety of binding sites that is used throughout the
calculations. The geometry of the resulting cluster is shown in Figure 1.

HCO and CH3 binding sites
For each radical, HCO and CH3 , the binding site distribution was probed by generating
60 different positions of the radical arranged symmetrically at the vertices of a truncated
icosahedron at a distance of approximately 3–4 Å above the surface around the entire cluster.
Geometry optimization at the PBEh-3c/mSVP level of theory was then performed resulting
in 60 binding sites. Binding energies were determined via the difference in energy between
the adsorbed species on the cluster and the separated radical and cluster. In other words,
the relaxation of the surface is included in the binding energy. We used the convention that
positive binding energies refer to exothermic binding. Subsequently, binding energies at the
M06-2X/TZVPD+D3 level of theory were calculated of the previously optimized structures.
Various different binding modes for both radicals were found. Three representative geometries were selected for HCO and two for CH3 for which the harmonic zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE) correction to the binding energy was calculated with PBEh-3c/mSVP.
The coordinates of these representative structures are provided in the Supporting Informa-

4

tion. These specific five geometries were then further refined through a reoptimization with
M06-2X/TZVPD+D3. During this reoptimization, to reduce the computational cost, all but
the four CO molecules closest to the adsorbant were kept frozen.

Surface reaction of HCO + CH3
The surface reaction of HCO with CH3 was studied through MD simulations in the microcanonical ensemble (NVE). Low random initial velocities, corresponding to a temperature
of 10 K, were assigned to restrict the study to barrier-less processes. A small time step of
0.2 fs was used. Overall, 56 trajectories were run, for 150 steps each (another 150 steps if
no reaction was found within the first 150 steps). The electronic structure of the biradical at the PBEh-3c/mSVP level was an unrestricted broken symmetry wave function that
showed clear separation of the spin densities between the radicals, positive spin density on
one radical and negative spin density on the other one. The five previously selected adsorbed
radical geometries were chosen as starting points and for each of these the other radical was
placed as relaxed structure in close proximity, 3–5 Å in various starting geometries. Because
the interaction between the radicals and the surface is rather weak, we assume that these
represent structures accessible by diffusion. In very few cases, non-physical structures were
obtained, in which the reactant turned out to be too close to the CO cluster initially. In
these cases it flew away rather than reacting. These were not considered in the following.
Here, we show that for each binding site both product channels are available, i.e., CH3 CHO
and CH4 + CO can be formed. Additionally an outcome of the simulation can also be that
no reaction takes place.
In principle it is possible to obtain a branching ratio for the two different product channels
by sampling sufficient binding sites per binding mode of the first adsorbed radical and running
MD simulations for multiple starting geometries with the second radical in close proximity.
However, this falls beyond the scope of this work as too many simulations would be necessary
to yield a statistically relevant result.

Benchmark of the level of theory
Given the total system size, between 34 and 41 atoms, we are restricted to using mainly the
PBEh-3c/mSVP level of theory. Often the M06-2X functional is seen as a more accurate
choice when higher levels of theory, such as CCSD(T)-F12, are not available. 34,35 In Table 1
the interaction energies of several smaller models, CH3 –CO and HCO–CO dimers and CH3 –
(CO)2 and HCO–(CO)2 trimers, are presented to estimate the accuracy for the larger cluster
used in the rest of this work. The values for PBEh-3c and M06-2X calculations are obtained
following a full optimization routine, whilst the values at the CCSD(T)-F12 level of theory
refer to energies calculated at the geometries optimized with PBEh-3c and M06-2X. All
values are given without zero-point energy correction.
It is immediately clear from the comparison between the DFT and CCSD(T)-F12 values
that both functionals tend to overestimate the interaction energy, predict too strong binding.
This increases with the number of CO molecules in the cluster and is largest for the CH3 (CO)n systems. In other words, the binding energy distributions obtained should be shifted
somewhat to lower binding energies.

Results and Discussion
HCO and CH3 binding sites
Binding energies for 60 binding sites for HCO and CH3 on the CO cluster were calculated.
The average potential energy for binding was 1050 K for HCO and 1150 K for CH3 , both
obtained with M06-2X+D3, see Table 2. With PBEh-3c/mSVP the binding is predicted
somewhat stronger for HCO and somewhat weaker for CH3 , see also Table 2. Depending on
the binding sites, the binding energies are rather broadly distributed, as indicated in Table 2.
This is consistent with findings for other adsorbates on amorphous surfaces. 37–39 Histograms
of the binding energy distributions are provided in the Supporting Information.
These values are compared to the binding energies to water calculated by Sameera et al. 34
for the same radicals on a crystalline water surface, to the results by Wakelam et al. 35
obtained from interaction with a single water molecule, and to the results by Enrique-Romero
et al. 36 on an amorphous water cluster in Table 2. The interaction of both radicals with a
H2 O surface is clearly stronger than with a CO surface, as expected.
Five representative binding modes were analyzed in more detail. The ZPE was calculated on the PBEh-3c/mSVP level. Subsequently, the geometry was refined at the M062X/TZVPD+D3 level. The resulting binding energies are listed in Table 3. The ZPE
correction is on average around 360 K for both radicals, but varies a bit between the binding
sites. The structures are shown in Figure 2, and non-bonded interatomic distances between

the adsorbates and the CO cluster are given in Table 4. All of the values are distances
between the adsorbate and the nearest CO molecules of the cluster. The label O–C refers to
distances from O of HCO to C of the nearest CO molecules, C–C refers to the distance of C
of CH3 to C of CO. It is clear from the rather large distances, that the adsorbates interact
rather weakly with the cluster. The full coordinates of these representative structures are
provided in the Supporting Information.
To estimate total binding energies for HCO and CH3 , the average binding energy on
the M06-2X+D3 level, the ZPE correction and the shift between M06-2X and CCSD(T)F12 should be taken into account. These result in very rough estimates of average binding
energies of 500 K for HCO and 200 K for CH3 on a CO surface. It should be noted that we
find a significant variation between our levels of theory, but even stronger variations between
the different binding sites. However, it can be concluded that the interaction of CO with
adsorbed HCO or CH3 is so weak that diffusion might actually be easy on CO-rich surfaces as
our binding energies are in the same range as the diffusion barriers obtained experimentally
for H on CO. 40

Surface reaction of HCO + CH3
For each of the five representative geometries depicted in Figure 2 between 4 and 6 different
placements of the second radical were used as initial geometries for MD simulation runs. For
each of these sets, we observed both reactive channels, to CH4 + CO as well as to CH3 CHO.
These are indeed barrier-less. The channel observed depends on the orientation of the two
radicals with respect to each other. In some cases, no reaction was found. The chosen
starting geometries probably lead to small barriers in these cases.
Figure 3 shows the initial geometries (left) and a representative snapshot after the reaction
(right) of the MD runs. The CO molecules are shown as sticks, the reactive radicals and
their products as balls and sticks. These three trajectories were obtained from the same
initial binding mode of HCO bound flat on the surface. The CH3 moiety was placed at

different positions, leading to different products. Note that given the low binding energies
of the radicals with the cluster, the initial geometries, for which the second reactant seems
to be somewhat distant from the cluster, are actually realistic. Here we do not consider the
reaction of one adsorbed radical with another radical from the gas phase.
For each of the five selected geometries (Figure 2) both CH4 + CO and CH3 CHO can be
formed. In several cases, the reactants stayed associated with the CO cluster, but did not
react.

Conclusions
We have studied the chemistry of HCO and CH3 radicals on an amorphous CO ice surface.
The binding energies of both radicals are low, which is understandable given their low dipole
moments and the inert character of the CO surface. The binding energies of approximately
500 K for HCO and 200 K for CH3 are comparable to those of hydrogen atoms on the CO
surface. As found for other adsorption processes on amorphous surfaces, a broad distribution
of the binding energies of HCO and CH3 was obtained. The comparison of the levels of theory
demonstrated that a thorough benchmarking, the inclusion of vibrational zero point energy,
as well as sufficient configurational sampling are necessary for reliable prediction of binding
energies. When both radicals are placed close to each other (3 to 4 Å), the relative orientation
of the reactants with respect to each other determines which of the products is formed: (a)
CH4 + CO, (b) CH3 CHO, or (c) no reaction. Thus, we have clearly shown that the formation
of complex organic molecules, like acetaldehyde, is possible from simpler radical species like
HCO and CH3 on a CO surface. We also found that some reaction products can desorb
from the surface. This will, however, depend strongly on the morphology of the ice. On
a rougher surface, the molecules are more likely to thermalize and stay bound to the ice.
Overall, this study should serve as a proof of principle that radical-radical recombinations
can lead to the buildup of complex organic molecules rather than as a quantitative study,

11

which would require much more configurational sampling. We hope that this will inspire
other theoretical chemists to investigate further similar combinations, which may explain
the buildup of larger, more complex organic species in interstellar environments.
