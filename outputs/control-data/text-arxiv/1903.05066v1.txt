Abstract—Age of Information (AoI) is a newly appeared
concept and metric to characterize the freshness of data. In this
work, we study the delay and AoI in a multiple access channel
(MAC) with two source nodes transmitting different types of data
to a common destination. The first node is grid-connected and
its data packets arrive in a bursty manner, and at each time slot
it transmits one packet with some probability. Another energy
harvesting (EH) sensor node generates a new status update with
a certain probability whenever it is charged. We derive the delay
of the grid-connected node and the AoI of the EH sensor as
functions of different parameters in the system. The results show
that the mutual interference has a non-trivial impact on the delay
and age performance of the two nodes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The Age of Information (AoI) has attracted increasing
attention as a new metric and tool to capture the timeliness of
reception and freshness of data [1]. This concept first appeared
in [2]–[4].
Consider a monitored source node which generates timestamped status updates, and transmits them through a wireless
channel or through a network to a destination. The age of
information that the destination has for the source, or more
simply the AoI, is the elapsed time from the generation of
the last received status update. Keeping the average AoI small
corresponds to having fresh information. This notion has been
extended to other metrics such as the value of information, cost
of update delay, and non-linear AoI [5], [6]. The deployment
of energy harvesting (EH) sensor networks is becoming an
important aspect of the future wireless networks, especially in
the Internet of Things (IoT) networks where devices opportunistically transmit small amounts of data with low power.
Sensors with EH capabilities can convert ambient energy (e.g.,
solar power, thermal energy, etc.) into electrical energy, which
allows for green and self-sustainable communication.
A. Related Works
Recently, several works have considered the AoI analysis
and optimization in a network with an EH source node.
This work was supported in part by ELLIIT, CENIIT, and the Swedish
Foundation for Strategic Research.

In [7], the authors consider the problem of optimizing the
process of sending updates from an EH source to a receiver
to minimize the time average age of updates. Similar system
and analysis can be found in [8]–[15]. In [16], an erasure
channel is considered between the EH-enabled transmitter and
the destination. The transmitter sends coded status updates
to the receiver in order to minimize the AoI. In [17], the
authors consider the scenario where the timings of the status
updates also carry an independent message. This information
is transmitted through a receiver with EH capabilities and the
trade-off between AoI and the information rate is studied.
The age-energy tradeoff is explored in [18], where a finitebattery source is charged intermittently by Poisson energy
arrivals. In [19], the optimal status updating policy for an
EH source with a noisy channel was investigated. In [20], the
authors consider the case with update failures as the updates
can be corrupted by noise. An optimal online updating policy
is proposed to minimize the average AoI, subject to an energy
causality constraint at the sensor.
Except the case with EH nodes harvesting ambient energy,
some other works have considered wireless power transfer
(WPT) to convert the received radio frequency signals to electric power [21]. In [22], the performance of a WPT-powered
sensor network in terms of the average AoI was studied. The
work in [23] considers freshness-aware IoT networks with EHenabled IoT devices. More specifically, the optimal sampling
policy for IoT devices that minimizes the long-term weighted
sum-AoI is investigated.
Since the status updates and regular information packets are
associated with difference performance metrics, e.g., one with
smallest AoI and the other with smallest delay, the impact
of heterogeneous traffic on the AoI and the optimal update
policy has been investigated in [24], [25]. The work in [26]
investigates Nash and Stackelberg equilibrium strategies for
DSRC and WiFi coexisting networks, where DSRC and WiFi
nodes are age and throughput oriented, respectively.
B. Contribution
Most of the existing works on AoI in EH-enabled networks
consider a single transmitting node. When there is more

than one node in the network with heterogeneous traffic and
different types of power supplies, the effect of random data
and energy arrivals on the performance of a multiple access
channel (MAC) has not been studied.
In this work, we study the MAC where one node connected
to the power grid has bursty arrivals of regular data packets,
and another EH sensor sends status update when its battery
is non-empty. We derive the data delay of the throughputoriented node and the AoI of the EH sensor, which are given
as functions of their transmission probabilities, the data arrival
rate at the source node and the energy arrival rate at the sensor,
which can be further used to optimize the operating parameters
of such systems.
II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a time-slotted MAC where two source nodes
with heterogeneous traffic intend to transmit to a common
destination D, as shown in Fig. 1. The first node S1 is
connected to the power grid, thus it is not power-limited. Note
that S1 is a throughput-oriented node, which intends to achieve
as high throughput as possible. The data packets arrives at S1
following a Bernoulli process with probability λ. We consider
an early departure late arrival model for the queue. When
the data queue of S1 is not empty, it transmits a packet to
the destination with probability q1 . The second node S2 is
not connected to a dedicated power source, but it can harvest
energy from its environment, such as wind or solar energy. We
assume that the battery charging process follows a Bernoulli
process with probability δ, with B denoting the number of
energy units in the energy source (battery) at node S2 . The
capacity of the battery is assumed to be infinite. When S2 has a
non-empty battery, it generates a status update with probability
q2 and transmits it to the destination.1 The transmission of one
status update consumes one energy unit from the battery.

energy-harvesting (EH) device share the same wireless channel to a common
destination. The EH device is generating status updates to transmit to the
destination.

We assume multi-packet reception (MPR) capabilities at the
destination node D, which means that D can decode multiple
messages simultaneously with a certain probability. MPR is a
generalized form of the packet erasure model, and it captures

in [27].

better the wireless nature of the channel since a packet can
be decoded correctly by a receiver that treats interference
as noise if the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) exceeds a certain threshold. We consider equal-size
data packets and the transmission of one packet occupies one
timeslot.
For the notational convenience, we define the following
successful transmission/reception probabilities, depending on
whether one or both source nodes are transmitting in a given
timeslot:
• pi/i : success probability of Si, i ∈ {1, 2} when only Si is
transmitting;
• pi/i, j : success probability of Si when both Si and S j are
transmitting;
In the case of an unsuccessful transmission from S1 , the
packet has to be re-transmitted in a future timeslot. We
assume that the receiver gives an instantaneous error-free
acknowledgment (ACK) feedback of all the packets that were
successful in a slot at the end of the slot. Then, S1 removes
the successfully transmitted packets from its buffer. In case of
an unsuccessful packet transmission from S2 , since it contains
a previously generated status update, that packet is dropped
without waiting to receive an ACK, and a new status update
will be generated for its next attempted transmission.

channel fading from the transmitter i to the destination, which
follows CN (0, 1) (Rayleigh fading); βi denotes the large-scale
fading coefficient of the link i; σ 2 denotes the thermal noise
power.
Denote by θ i , i = {1, 2}, the SINR thresholds for having
successful transmission. By utilizing the small-scale fading

In this section, we study the performance of node S1
regarding (stable) throughput and the average delay per packet
needed to reach the destination. The service probability of S1
is given by

In this work, we mainly focus on the case where S2 relies
on energy harvesting to operate, but for comparison purposes
we also consider the case that S2 is connected to the power
grid, thus does not have energy limitations.

where M is a random variable that represents the number
of attempted transmissions between two successfully received
status updates. Note that Xk is a stationary random process,
in the following we use E[X] as the expected value of Xk for
an arbitrary k.
Recall that one energy chunk is consumed to transmit one
status update. For a period of N time slots where K successful
updates occur, the average AoI can be computed as

A. When S2 relies on EH
When node S2 relies on EH to operate, recall that the
energy arrivals at the EH node S2 follows a Bernoulli process
with probability δ. The evolution of the energy queue can be
modeled as a Discrete Time Markov Chain. Denote by B the
energy queue size, we have Pr(B , 0) = qδ2 when δ < q2 ,
which will be the case we consider in the remainder of this
paper.2 Plugging it in (3), we obtain
µ = q1 p1/1 (1 − δ) + q1 δp1/1,2 .

(4)

The queue of S1 is stable if and only if λ < µ, which
λ
corresponds to q1 > p1/1 (1−δ)+δ
p1/1,2 . When the queue is stable,
the probability that the queue is non-empty is P[Q , 0] = µλ .

Since lim

µ = q1 (1 − q2 )p1/1 + q1 q2 p1/1,2 .

The queue is stable if and only if q1 > 1−q2 p1/1λ+q2 p1/1,2 .
The throughput of node S1 is T = min{λ, µ}. When the
queue is stable, the delay of S1 , which consists of queueing
delay and transmission delay, is given by [28]

When the queue is unstable, the delay is infinite due to the
infinite queueing delay.

The probability that the information queue of S1 is non-empty
depends on the average service rate of S1 , which is affected
by the activity of the EH sensor because of the interference.

V. N UMERICAL E VALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the delay of node S1 and the
average AoI of node S2 to illustrate the relation between these
two metrics and the impact of different system parameters on
these two performance metrics.
Since our analytical results of the delay and AoI do not
require any specific channel model, the parameters we use in
this section are: Pσ1 β2 1 = 11 dB, Pσ2 β2 2 = 13 dB.
A. Delay of Node S1
In Figs. 3 and 4, we plot the delay per packet for node S1 as
functions of the data arrival rate λ and the energy arrival rate
δ of the EH node, respectively. It is obvious that the delay
increases with λ and q2 , as we can see from (6). Note that
for Fig. 3 we only present the values of D for λ ∈ [0, 0.4],
because when λ is too large, the queue of S1 becomes unstable
and the delay is infinite.

D

B. AoI of Node S2
In Figs. 5 and 6, we plot the AoI of the node S2 as
a function of the transmission probability q2 , for the cases
when S2 relies on EH and when it is connected to a power
grid, respectively. First, from both figures we observe that
when θ is higher, the AoI is larger. This is expected since
a higher SINR threshold gives a lower transmission success
probability, which consequently increases the AoI. Second,
the most noticeable difference between these two figures is
that, in Fig. 5 for the case with q1 = 0.6 and θ = 5 dB, the
AoI first decreases then increases with q2 , while in the other
cases AoI monotonically decreases with q2 . This is because the
AoI can be interference-limited or battery-limited depending
on whether it relies on EH or not. In Fig. 5, S2 only relies
on harvested energy and the energy arrival rate is relatively
small (δ = 0.3). When q2 increases to the a certain level,
keep increasing the transmission probability q2 might not help
reducing the AoI because the collision probability increases,
and the energy chunks might be wasted when S2 attempts to
transmit too often.
In Fig. 7, we show the AoI of S2 as a function of the energy
arrival rate δ. In all cases, the AoI decreases with δ, since δ
increases the probability that S2 is charged.
In Figs. 8 and 9, we plot the AoI of node S2 as a function
of the data arrival rate λ of node S1 , for the cases when S2
relies on EH and when it is connected to the power grid,
respectively. For all the cases, the AoI first increases with λ,
and then saturates. This is because the throughput of node S1
is min{λ, µ}. When the throughput is limited by the arrival
rate λ, increasing λ means higher probability P[Q , 0], thus
higher interference to the transmission of status updates from
S2 . When the throughput is limited by the service rate µ,
increasing λ will not change the interference because the queue
of S1 is always saturated, and the AoI will remain the same.
