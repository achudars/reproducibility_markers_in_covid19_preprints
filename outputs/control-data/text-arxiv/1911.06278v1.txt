Abstract
Neuroimaging studies based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically
employ rigorous forms of preprocessing. Images are spatially normalized to
a standard template using linear and non-linear transformations. Thus, one can
assume that a patch at location (x, y, height, width) contains the same brain region
across the entire data set. Most analyses applied on brain MRI using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) ignore this distinction from natural images. Here, we
suggest a new layer type called patch individual filter (PIF) layer, which trains
higher-level filters locally as we assume that more abstract features are locally
specific after spatial normalization. We evaluate PIF layers on three different tasks,
namely sex classification as well as either Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or multiple
sclerosis (MS) detection. We demonstrate that CNNs using PIF layers outperform
their counterparts in several, especially low sample size settings.

Introduction

CNNs have been successfully applied on neuroimaging data [1, 2]. However, several challenges have
been discussed: First, sample sizes are low and public data sets typically contain no more than 1,000
patients of a specific disease. Second, MR sequences are three dimensional and can contain up to 1
million non-zero voxels, making the number of features much greater than the number of samples.
Lastly, many features of the brain and neurological or psychiatric diseases are not fully understood.
Even though there are guidelines for neurological assessment of diseases, these change over time (e.g.
the McDonald criteria [3, 4]) and only represent our current understanding of a disease.
Previous approaches using CNNs in neuroimaging tend to convert architectures which are successful
on natural images to 3D MRI classifiers [5] by replacing 2D with 3D operations. In those, the special
features of MRI data are typically ignored. Here, we specifically make use of the spatial homogeneity
of brain MRI data. Through linear and non-linear transformations, MR images are normalized to a
shared template within the MNI space such as the ICBM 152 atlas [6–8]. This ensures that a voxel
at location L contains more or less the same brain region in every image and allows researchers to
investigate a specific region (e.g. the hippocampus) across subjects. We suggest to address the spatial
homogeneity by training within patches of the image and evaluate this approach in three different
tasks: sex classification, AD and MS detection. Unlike patch-based approaches (see Section Related
Work) we only intend to train patch-wise in higher layers. This is motivated by the idea of abstraction:
whereas lower level features such as edge detectors might be globally relevant, some higher level
features might be more locally relevant. Because higher level filters in the PIF setting train on patches

which contain less information and noise than the entire image, we show here that they require fewer
iterations over the training set as well as fewer samples to converge as compared to vanilla CNNs.

Related Work

PIF layers are different from patch-based training. In patch-based training [9–11], multiple patches
are sampled from the dataset and fed into the same classifier regardless of the position of each patch.
Therefore, the classifier’s filters share weights between different patches. Conversely, within PIF
layers, weights are only shared within a spatially restricted patch. PatchGANs [12, 13] use Markovian
patches as input for a discriminator network in order to focus penalization on high-frequency structure.
PIF layers are a generalization of local convolutions as implemented in Lasagne1 and Keras2 . Local
convolutions are similar to regular convolutions but do not share weights. Local convolutions are a
special case of PIF layers where s + p = k, where s is the patch size, p is the padding size and k is
the kernel size. Thus, the convolution kernel does not slide over the selected patch (because they are
congruent).

Methods

The heterogeneity of natural images depicting the same object requires filters to be convolved with
the entire image. In a cat detection model, for example, we would expect that some higher level
filters detect cat ears. In this case, it is necessary to convolve those cat ear filters with the entire
image, because cat ears might be located anywhere in the image. However, when all images are
spatially standardized, e.g. objects are in the same angle, viewpoint and distance and all major
facial features of the cats are at the same location in each image, it would suffice if the cat ear filter
searches around a small subspace of the image. This drastic form of spatial normalization is unlikely
to achieve in natural images, but in neuroimaging it is the de facto standard and a major requirement
for mass-univariate and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA).
For the analysis of spatially normalized MRI data, we suggest a new CNN architecture relying on PIF
layers. PIF layers consist of 3 stages: (i) split, (ii) process and (iii) reassemble. Each output feature
map of the previous layer is first split (i) into patches of size (s × s). Next, the patches pij at row
i and column j of all feature maps are processed (ii) with a series of local convolutions of kernel
size (k × k). This is repeated for all patches. When s > k, weights are shared within each patch pij
but not across patches. Lastly, all patches are reassembled (iii) in the same order as they were split.

Experiments

We evaluated PIF layers on three different datasets/tasks: 1) sex classification on a subset of the
UK Biobank (F=1005, M=849), 2) AD detection on data of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI; AD=475, HC=494) and 3) MS detection on a small private data set (MS=76,
HC=71). We evaluate the performance in terms of balanced accuracy, iterations until early stopping
and performance on a smaller subset. The subset contains 20% of randomly drawn samples from
the full data set. As the number of samples for the MS data set is already small, we did not use
a subset here. We compare results to a simple 5-layer CNN architecture that has shown good
results on the ADNI data set and is adjusted slightly for each task. For UK Biobank and ADNI the
number of parameters is smaller in the PIF architecture, whereas in MS it is larger. After finding
suitable hyperparameters (learning rate, weight decay, number of filters, dropout) for each task, all
experiments were repeated 10 times and averages over all repetitions are reported. Data for baseline
model training was augmented using horizontal flips and translation, whereas for PIF model training
only horizontal flips were used to avoid misaligned images.

Results

Table 1 shows the balanced accuracy and iteration in which training finished using early stopping. On
the sex classification task (UK Biobank), the PIF model works almost identical on the full data set
with an accuracy of almost 90%. When using the small subset of only 20% from the original data set,
the balanced accuracy of the PIF model increased from 64.47% to 78.11%. On the full data set, the
required iterations until early stopping almost halve, whereas on the subset they increase from 40.7 to
69.5 iterations. This is the only case where the PIF architecture has a higher number of iterations
and might be due to the task-specific PIF model having a higher amount of parameters than on the
other data sets. On the AD classification task (ADNI), both baseline and PIF model perform similarly
with a balanced accuracy of around 84.5% but with a reduced set of required iterations in case of the
PIF model (31.8 to 22.3). On the ADNI subset, the baseline outperformed the PIF architecture with
an accuracy of 81.09% over 76.65% but early stopping with the PIF model occurred on average in
iteration 71.9 compared to iteration 106.4 in the baseline model. Lastly, for MS detection balanced
accuracy increased from 75.04% to 80.92% when using the PIF architecture and the required number
of iterations decreased on average from 83.7 to 53.5.

Discussion

In this work, we have introduced a new CNN architecture relying on PIF layers to harness the
established techniques of spatial normalization in neuroimaging. In multiple experiments, we have
shown that PIF layers can outperform simple CNNs, especially in low sample scenarios. Further
experiments are required to investigate whether the success of PIF layers is task-specific, such as the
learning of regional differences in MS lesions in comparison to global atrophy in AD.
