ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present Breadcrumbs, a mobility dataset collected
in the city of Lausanne (Switzerland) from multiple mobile phone
sensors (GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth) from 81 users for a duration of 12
weeks. Currently available mobility datasets are restricted to geospatial information obtained through a single sensor at low spatiotemporal granularities. Furthermore, this passively collected data lacks
ground-truth information regarding points of interest and their semantic labels. These features are critical in order to push the possibilities of geospatial data analysis towards analyzing mobility
behaviors and movement patterns at a fine-grained scale. To this
end, Breadcrumbs provides ground-truth and semantic labels for
the points of interest of all the participants. The dataset also contains fine-grained demographic attributes, contact records, calendar
events and social relationship tags between the participants. In
order to demonstrate the significance of the ground-truth annotations, we discuss several use cases of this dataset. Furthermore,
we compare four contrasting and widely used unsupervised clustering approaches for point of interest extraction from geolocation
trajectories. Using the ground-truth information, we perform a detailed performance validation of these techniques and highlight their
strengths and weaknesses. Given that mobility data is derived from
an individuals inherent need of participating in activities, narrowing
the gap between raw trajectory data points and complete trip annotation in essential. We thus make Breadcrumbs accessible to the
research community in order to facilitate research in the direction of
supervised human mobility learning schemes.

INTRODUCTION

The proliferation of GPS equipped smartphones and Internet connectivity has simplified the process of collecting positional data
generated by moving entities. Spatiotemporal data streams (trajectories) generated by using people centric sensing technologies [7]
can be stored and made available as mobility datasets. Modeling
human mobility using such datasets is increasingly gaining importance as cities are experiencing rapid transformation and growth,
which demands a good understanding of individual mobility behavior. Mobility datasets are therefore fundamental for designing
and evaluating algorithms pertaining to Geographic Information

Systems (GIS) and to facilitate experimental reproducibility. More
specifically, the advancement of techniques addressing spatiotemporal data-based problems such as predictive queries [16], object
tracking [47], trajectory indexing [8], mobility modeling [3] and
location privacy [39] have transpired due to availability of several
geospatial mobility datasets [55, 50, 37, 51, 33, 27].
While the publicly available mobility datasets have been widely
used in GIS research to answer classical GIS research questions
(movement analysis, trajectory indexing and queries), we highlight
four critical limitations that stifle pushing the possibilities of geospatial data analysis further. These include: (1) lack of positioning
information from multiple sensors, (2) unavailability of geolocation
points at a high spatiotemporal granularity throughout the span of
data collection duration, (3) lack of ground truth information regarding participant points of interest (POI), and (4) unavailability
of semantic information regarding the POI. Datasets such as [52,
37, 51] are restricted to traces derived from a single sensor; either
GPS, GSM, WiFi or Bluetooth. Having access to high granularity
multi-sensor positioning data can lead complex and richer comparative and compositional studies [33]. Furthermore, since mobility
data is derived from an individual’s inherent need of participating in
activities, lack of ground truth and semantic information is a critical
limitation of available passively collected datasets. Currently, large
amount of trajectory data is captured, but the associated activity
information is poor, which is crucial for research domains such as
social network pattern mining [18, 14], behavioral regularities [6],
and behavioral entropy [28].
In this paper, we present a methodological description of geospatial data collection process to avail a dataset capturing multiple
aspects of human mobility behavior. We present Breadcrumbs, a
mobility dataset containing high granularity geolocation data points
from GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth and accelerometer sensors from 81 individuals in Switzerland for a period of 12 weeks. We further enrich
this dataset with point of interest (POI) ground-truth annotation
and semantic labels along with demographic attributes, social relationships, calendar events and contact records. This information is
especially important given that the last decade has seen an increasing
demand of understanding the semantic behavior of moving objects
in multiple sectors [32]. This refers to semantic abstractions of the
raw mobility trajectories annotated with the knowledge extracted
from the participants. Having access to the ground-truth, regarding
the places where an individual actually spent time and has a meaningful accord with, is also crucial for corroborating the performance
of data mining algorithms.
Along with the dataset description, we frame a research question
that highlights the importance of a unique feature of Breadcrumbs,
i.e., ground-truth information. Our research question is thus: Given

the ground-truth information, which clustering approach and parameter settings provides the best sensitivity and specificity results? We
perform a systematic comparison of four widely used spatiotemporal clustering approaches: (1) k-means, (1) DBSCAN, (2) DJ Cluster, and (4) DT Cluster. We also present our approach to perform
accurate validation over the POI ground-truth labels and clusters extracted by different algorithms. We experimentally demonstrate how
the ground-truth information can be used as labels to aid computing
the ROC characteristics.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We present
a brief review of the existing mobility datasets and a summary of
popular POI extraction techniques in Section 2. This Section also
presents some use cases facilitated by the Breadcrumbs dataset. The
data collection process is presented in Section 3 followed by the
quantitative analysis in Section 4. Then, we present a comparison
of four clustering algorithms and precisely describe the way we
evaluate them in an evaluation framework in Section 5. We finally
conclude the paper in Section 6.

RELATED WORK & USE CASES

In this section, we review the existing mobility datasets and list
their features. We also present and summarize the spatiotemporal
clustering techniques used to extract POIs from the geospatial mobility datasets. Finally, we highlight some of use cases and fields of
research that could benefit from the Breadcrumbs dataset.

2.1

Mobility Datasets and Applications

Geolocation mobility datasets mainly contain passively collected
positioning data points that form a trajectory [38, 22, 4, 55, 33].
Such datasets focussing explicitly on geo-positioning information
have been extensively used in several research domains such as
discovery of points of interests [46], computing trajectory similarity [31] and designing frameworks for processing trajectory queries
[53]. Another domain of geospatial data research studies the interaction between human mobility behaviors and social relationships.
This was driven by several datasets that provide annotated social
relationships with spatiotemporal data points [27, 51, 13]. Such
annotated datasets have been used to estimate similarity between
users based on their location histories and infer potential social ties.
The performance of the framework was validated against the groundtruth about social relationship collected from the participants.
The above trends have led to a new domain in location privacy,
that focusses on inferring social relationships from mobility datasets.
This task also involves formulating novel inference attacks and improved threat models [2]. Mobility datasets containing demographic
information [51, 13, 12] have also contributed to location privacy

research, wherein these datasets have been used to construct attacks
to infer sensitive demographic attributes [56]. Furthermore, call
detail record datasets with home and work place labels have been
used to construct attacks against aggregated mobility datasets [49].
In Table 1, we present a summary of currently available mobility
datasets along with the associated features and the data types. We
observe that majority of the datasets are restricted to positioning data
from either one or two sensors and does not provide demographic
attributes or ground-truth information. MDC dataset offers basic
demographic information including the participants sex, age group
and gender. However this information is not available for all the
users of the dataset. Contrary to the existing datasets, we ensure
collection of equivalent data points for each participant, ensuring a
satisfactory users to data points ratio. Breadcrumbs also provides
ground-truth annotations and exhaustive demographic attributes as
compared to existing mobility datasets as highlighted in Table 1,
necessary to push the boundaries of current research. This information is critical in order to identify attack vectors and proactively
fix the vulnerabilities before releasing user information. These efforts by the research community have resulted in devising improved
strategies for anonymizing and aggregation of user location data [2].
Such efforts are also necessary to offer a satisfactory trade-off between utility and privacy of trajectory data [54]. Along these lines,
we argue that the annotations provided by the Breadcrumbs dataset
with regards to POI ground truth and semantic labelling will foster
improvement in constructing such utility/privacy measures. For
instance, formulating a probabilistic model for obfuscation mechanisms, where only the actual points of interests are obfuscated to to
maintain a satisfactory trade-off [19].

2.2

Point of Interest Extraction

The seminal work in adopting data mining and clustering techniques for spatiotemporal POI extracting was proposed by Ashbrook et al. [1], where they presented an iterative approach to
extract clusters while imposing spatiotemporal bounds. Then, a
two-level clustering approach was proposed by Montoliu et al. [34]
wherein the spatiotemporal trajectories are first clustered in the
time domain and then in the spatial domain to detect stay-points
and successively extract stay-regions. Several density based clustering approaches were later proposed such as Density-Joinable
clustering [58], Density-Time clustering [25], Time-Density Clustering [23] and ZOI detect [30]. These approaches use several
parameters to perform clustering in order to extract the POIs. These
parameters include maximum/minimum distance/time between the
trajectory data points, cluster shape, maximum number of data
points per cluster among others. Kulkarni et al. [29] proposed a

parameter-less technique for extracting POIs from spatiotemporal
trajectories without any a-priori assumptions. In this paper, we
use a clustering algorithm based on Density-Time clustering (see
Section 3.2) to identify hotspots in the dataset participants trajectories. We then validated these hotspots through the participants to
construct the ground-truth. Using this ground-truth information, we
compare the performance of clustering technique described in this
section.

2.3

Research Areas

In this section, we provide a non-exhaustive list of the research
areas and application domains that might benefit from the features
provided by Breadcrumbs.
Next-place Prediction. Given the current location of a user, nextplace prediction aims at forecasting the place where the user will
head next. POIs used in conjunction with statistical models, such
as Markov chains, are known to address this problem reasonably
well [23, 24]. Other approaches focused on Bayesian networks,
neural networks and decision trees as detailed in [45, 20]. However
a lot of research recently focused on leveraging recent findings in
machine learning to improve next-place predictions. In this regard,
the need to qualitatively compare prediction methods with each
other, requires the access to the clusters extracted from the data and
the ground truth associated with these clusters.
Trajectory Prediction. Given the current location of a user, trajectory prediction aims at forecasting the trajectory or path that the user
will follow while heading to his next POI. More complex statistical
models are required to perform such prediction and the historical
GPS traces collected by the user are needed to create more accurate
predictions [10]. In a way which is similar to next-place prediction,
the ground-truth is needed to qualitatively assess the forecasts.
Trajectory Indexing. The indexing and retrieval of trajectories and
sub-trajectories is a central problem for a wide range of applications,
such as car sharing, ride hailing, traffic forecasting, etc. Recent
retrieval techniques focus on the ability to query by trajectories, i.e.,
the query itself is in the form of a trajectory and the result contain
the most relevant matching trajectories of the dataset [42, 9]. As
trajectory indexing can be affected by factors such as the quality
of the GPS signal and its sampling rate, a realistic dataset is often
necessary to test indexing mechanisms.
Synthetic Trajectory Generation. Location data is often considered as being sensitive. As a result, sharing them publicly comes
with privacy implication and it is difficult to release large and dense
datasets made of real trajectories. Therefore, a common practice
consists in creating synthetic but realistic trajectories. Some models,

such as BerlinMod [17], aim at generating trajectories for benchmarking spatiotemporal databases. More recently, machine learning
as been used extensively to generate synthetic trajectories. In this
regard, having access to sensor data, such as the accelerometer, can
help at generating more realistic trajectories.
Privacy Preserving LBS. As mentioned, sharing location data is
often associated with privacy concerns. For instance, can the demographic group to which a user belong be guessed on the basis of the
data recoded by the sensors of his mobile phones? Having access
to a dataset that gathers both location data and demographic data is
key to devise and mitigate such inference attacks. Some research
have been designed in this domain in order to infer demographics
data by using the entropy level of an individual [36]. Other research
works also tried to infer demographics information based on other
types of data such as access points and location check-ins [57, 48].
Our dataset is clearly an added value because of the richness of the
demographics information.
Health and Mobility Behavior. Several research studies have been
done in the domain of health related to mobility behavior. For example, some researchers studies the mobility of senior individuals [21]
and derived indicators based on GPS sensor data. Other researchers
studied the influence of having a dog on the mobility of senior individuals [44]. Finally, [40] presented an analysis related to mobility
behaviors in the context of cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer.
With the locations of individuals and the additional data captured
with the survey, it is possible to conduct health analysis combined
with mobility patterns. Figures 12, 13, 14 and 15 illustrate four
examples of research topics related to sport exercise frequency, seasonal allergies, smokers and diet respectively.
Supervised POI detection. User points of interest are currently
extracted from mobility trajectories using clustering approaches
that are unsupervised in nature. We propose a supervised POI
detection approach, where the ground truth annotations serve as
labels. In order to formalize the POI classification problem, the raw
latitude, longitude and timestamps and passed through a time-series
featurizer. The featurizer calculates a large number of trajectory
characteristics/features such as autocorrelation, entropy, wavelet
transform coefficients, number of peaks and crossings among others.
This set of featurized trajectories can be trained on a binary classifier
using the ground truth labels or the semantic labels to predict the
next semantic place. Such a classifier can be used to asses the feature
relevance contributing to a mobility trajectory terminating with a
valid POI with a given semantic label.

The data collection campaign was designed to address the limitations of the currently available spatiotemporal mobility datasets.
In this Section, we describe the design framework adopted to meet
each of the limitation and the resulting tradeoffs. We group the
limitations in two categories: (1) collecting high-granularity data
points from multiple sensors, and (2) collecting ground-truth information about participant mobility. In order to address these limitations, Breadcrumbs data collection campaign aimed at collecting
positioning data from GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth and accelerometer sensors, demographic information, calendar events and contact records,
ground truth information labelled by the participants at the end of
the campaign. The dataset contains the above information for 81
individuals, collected mainly in the city of Lausanne (Switzerland)
for a period of 12 weeks. The participants include students from 5
different faculties from universities located in Switzerland and some
of their relatives. Geolocation information is classified under Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by the EU privacy regulations
(GDPR) 1 . The system architecture adopted for the Breadcrumbs
data collection campaign is presented in Figure 2.

3.1

High Granularity of Multi-Sensor Data

The data was collected through a mobile application installed
on participants’ smartphones. The application was designed with
an objective to be non-intrusive to the participant activity, while
optimizing the data collection to power consumption tradeoff. The
sampling rate was calibrated to meet the operational requirements
for one day’s smartphone usage and obtain a satisfactory granularity
in the geolocation data points. To this end, we limited the sampling
of GPS location and accelerometer reading only when the distance
between the two location instances is five meters or greater. The
Service Set Identifier (SSID) of the WiFi access point/s and device
UUIDs of Bluetooth device/s scan was recorded instantaneously or
through the periodic scans by the smartphones The data was stored
locally, anonymized, encrypted and uploaded to the server when the
device is connected to a known WLAN access point.
The server consisted of a PostgreSQL database, a participant
notification delivery engine, maintenance and data mirroring frameworks. The complete database schema is shown in Figure 1. The
periodic analysis based on this data was used to send the participation status notifications to the respective individual. This system
was also used to recommend data collection and power usage improvement strategies to ensure an uninterrupted data stream.

Figure 4: Geolife Dataset

The socio-demographic information collected from the participants include age group, employment/marital status, mode of transportation during the week/week-end, field of study, level of education, frequency of participation in sport activities, allergies, smoking
habits among several others. In order to obtain the ground-truth
regarding the points of interest, we first computed all the spatiotemporal clusters present in an individual’s trajectories throughout the
data collection period. In order to select the appropriate technique,
we first compared several spatiotemporal clustering approaches. Our
objective was to select the approach that computes all the relevant
clusters relying on minimal a-priori parameters while minimizing
duplicate/redundant zones. We focus on verifying that the approach
does not eliminate any true positives while allowing for the presence
of false positives under a satisfactory threshold. It is crucial to have
approximately equal distribution between true positives and false
positives in order to train supervised machine learning approaches.
In order to analyze the sensitivity thresholds of the clustering
algorithms in extracting POISs , we benchmark the performance
of commonly used spatiotemporal clustering approaches on the
MDC dataset [27] (same region as Breadcrumbs) and the Geolife
dataset [55] to assess the number of clusters extracted. In order to inform the sensitivity analysis, we leverage a large number of existing
works that have benchmarked the mobility behavior of individuals
in these datasets [43]. We compared the approaches specified by
Gambs et al. [23], (1) DJ Cluster [58], (2) DT Cluster [11], (3) TD
Cluster [23] and a parameter-less approach (4) Capstone [29]. In
order to perform this analysis, we select users with distinct activity
areas captured with respect to the radius of gyration of movement
to include distinct mobility behaviors. As shown in Figures 3 and 4
DJ Cluster [58] detects a significantly high number of POIs, not
typical for an average user based on the mobility behavioral studies
by Thamason et al. [43]. The parameter-less approach [29] and TD
Cluster (a variant of DT-clustering) on the other hand detects fewer
POIs and could potentially lead to elimination of true positives.
We therefore used a clustering approach based on DT Cluster [11]
to compute all the clusters in an individual’s trajectories which offers
an optimal tradeoff between potentially displaying two or more
clusters at a single location and omitting true POIs. We considered
that a cluster is defined by a centroid and a radius, the latter is
computed using all the points contained in a cluster. Here, we modify
the original DT-clustering approach, where we merge two clusters if
they overlap with one another, by accounting for the centroids of the
clusters as well as their radius. Furthermore, we add a filter on the
number of visits to a cluster and select the ones where a participant
visited least 3 times during the 12 weeks of the data collection
timeframe. These clusters were then displayed to each respective
participants along with the validation option to annotate each of the
clusters and further provide semantic labels using our application
at the end of the collection campaign. The labels span 9 categories
(transport, study, residency, work, sustenance, shopping, sports,
leisure and other (free-text)). Additionally, each participant tagged
their relationship with other individuals participating in the data
collection campaign. This information along with the demographic

information, geolocation points forming trajectories was aggregated
upon removing all the participant identifiers to assemble the dataset.
The preprocessing involved removal of the duplicate points and
merging all the records sequentially.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

Figure 6: POI clusters and horizontal accuracy of the GPS locations.

The WiFi SSIDs are not mapped to the GPS locations, instead
a unique identifier corresponding to the MAC address of the WiFi
access point is stored. These identifiers act as a spatial indicator of
the participant location. The recurrent WiFi connections along with
the respective participant is shown in Figure 7.

In this Section we perform quantitative analysis of the Breadcrumbs data and present the different feature sets along with the
descriptive statistics. Breadcrumbs dataset contains 46,380,042
records gathering GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth and accelerometer data
points. The dataset was collected for a period of 12 weeks from
March-May 2018, retrieving geolocation data of 81 individuals at
a sampling rate of 60 sec. The aggregate distance traversed by the
participants amount to 548,210 km and the average distance covered per participant is approximately 6,768 km. Figure 5 shows the
spatial extent traversed by the participants. The largest age groups
present in the campaign were 18-21 and 22-27, with 53% and 44%
of the sample falling to these age ranges respectively. 57% of the
participants identified as females and 73% participants were in a
bachelors degree program and 25% in a masters program. The participants span the faculty of law, medicine, business, economics,
literature, physics, biology, chemistry and computer science.

Geolocation Data

The summary of the GPS data points are presented in Table 2.
Here, the horizontal accuracy indicates a radius about a 2-dimensional
point, implying that the true unknown location is within the circle.
Vertical accuracy gives the altitude correctness of a 1-dimensional
location within the region defined by the radius. The median horizontal and vertical accuracy of the GPS data points is less than 10
meters or less. Table 3 shows the number of records collected by
the different sensors. The distribution of the POIs in the city and the
horizontal accuracy of the GPS coordinates is shown in Figure 6.

Points of Interest

In this Section, we summarize the point of interest information
extracted form the raw trajectories and present the descriptive statistics regarding the following aspects: (1) distribution of semantic
labels, (2) connectivity graph of POI sharing, and (3) geographical
overview of the POIs. We find that a majority of the POIs are located at transport hubs, university area and leisure places as shown
in Figure 8. We also observe the distinct POI clusters shared by a
different user groups along with several isolated POIs in Figure 9.
A nodes in the figure denotes a unique POI and an edge signifies a
user connectivity to that POI.

4.3

Demographic attributes

In this section, we present the descriptive statistics pertaining to
the demographics information collected using survey questionnaires.
This information includes transportation mode preference of the
participants, health related information and information such as
parents’ home region and high school location.
From this survey, we have highlighted mobility trends related
to transportation modes preferences and patterns as preliminary
results. Figure 10 shows the transportation mode preferences during
weekday and weekend. We observe an increased usage of private

related to some particular transportation modes preferences. For
example, the majority of the Breadcrumbs’ participants who eat
a diversified food and most of the time organic seem not use cars
during the week in Figure 15.

CLUSTERING COMPARISON & VALIDATION

In this section, we perform a comparative analysis of four clustering approaches that aim at extracting POIs belonging to all the
participants of the Breadcrumbs project. We also focus on describing
the usage of the ground-truth information to validate and compare
the performance of different clustering algorithms.

5.1

Clustering Algorithm Descriptions

K-means and DBSCAN only account for the spatial dimension
of the locations, while DJ Cluster and DT Cluster utilize both, the
spatial and temporal dimensions of the locations.
k-means. k-means is a widely used spatiotemporal clustering algorithm. Amongst the different versions of k-means, we rely on the
one proposed by Hartigan and Wong [26]. The algorithm takes two
input values: k, indicating the number of clusters to be obtained, and
the set of data-points to be be grouped in to k clusters. The output
is k clusters representing the user points of interest. The algorithm
operates as follows:

transport (cars) during the week-end compared to the weekdays
where the participants rely on public transportation, including trams,
bus and trains. The usage of bikes and walking preference is similar
during the weekdays and the weekend. Figure 11 presents the
weekly mobility pattern choices according to the parents’ home
region. We observe that the most represented patterns are Public
Transportation + Bike/Walking and Car + Public Transportation
+ Bike/Walking. Secondly, the figure also highlights that the least
represented is the individuals who only use cars on a weekly basis.
The most represented parents’ home regions of the individuals who
follow the first pattern are located in France and Another Swiss state.
The most represented parents’ home region of the individuals who
follow the second pattern is located in Canton de Vaud (this Swiss
district includes the Lausanne region). This finding indicates that
most of the individuals of the second pattern study very close to
their parent’s home region.
In Figures 12, 13, 14 and 15, we superimposed health characteristics on weekly transportation mode preferences. Health characteristics are the following: frequency of sport exercise of the
Breadcrumbs’ participants, if they have seasonal allergies or not,
if they smoke or not and the type of diet of the participants. The
figures highlight that some specific health characteristics may be

• k points are randomly chosen in the initial set of points and
considered as the initial centroids of the k clusters;
• All the points of the initial set of points are then assigned
with their closest centroid based on the Euclidean distance
between points and the centroids;
• All the centroids of the k clusters are then updated by calculating the mean of all points being associated to a cluster;
• Finally the algorithm iterates until converging into a stable
state in which there is no more additional way to minimize
the total sum of squared Euclidean distances between points
and their related centroid.
DBSCAN. DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm based on the density
of the points linked to clusters. Unlike k-means, we do not need to
specify the number clusters a priori and is not known beforehand.
The algorithm takes three input values: eps, which is the maximum
radius of the neighborhood of a point, minPts, which indicates the
minimum number of points that must be in the neighborhood of
a point, and the initial set of points (i.e., locations) that must be
grouped in several clusters. These clusters represent the user POIs.
DBSCAN operates as follows:

• The algorithm starts evaluating each data-point of the initial
by computing the density with respect to all the other points
using the eps value and the minPts. This step associates a
category to each point between the core, border and noise
points. Noise points are later deleted;
• Neighborhood core points, which are density-reachable, are
then associated with the same cluster;
• Finally, border points are associated to the nearest cluster.
DJ Cluster. DJ Cluster is a clustering algorithm that takes into
account spatiotemporal dimensions [58]. The algorithm takes four
input parameters: minPts, which is minimum of points located in
a candidate cluster, r, which is the radius of a candidate cluster,
speed-threshold, which is maximum speed we will use to extract the
meaningful points from which the candidate clusters are built, and
the initial set of points (i.e., locations).

• The algorithm initiates by deleting all moving points (a moving point is deleted if the time difference with the previous
point is greater than speed-threshold);
• Then, we compute the neighborhood density of each remaining point and only keep the points that have at least minPts
points in a specific r. The remaining points of this step are
the candidate clusters;
• Finally, a merging step is realized. The algorithm merges the
candidates clusters that share at least one common point.
DT Cluster. DT Cluster is a spatiotemporal clustering algorithm [11].
The algorithm takes three input parameters: d, which is the radius
of the candidate clusters created at the beginning of the process, t,
which is minimum time period spent in the candidate clusters also
created at the beginning of the algorithm, and the initial set of points
(i.e., locations).

• The algorithm starts by evaluating the full set of points (i.e.,
locations) like a time series. It extracts all candidate clusters
by gathering the successive points that are located in the same
d for a duration greater than t;

Evaluation Framework and Parameters

In this section, we present the performance evaluation framework.
The evaluation is based on two steps that will be described hereafter.
For sake of simplicity, we will take the example of one single Breadcrumbs participant. However, the evaluation in the results section
considers all the 81 participants. The evaluation takes as input the
ground-truth information labelled by the user and a clustering algorithm Figure 16 presents the ground-truth of the participant as well
as the annotations (i.e., yes or no) linked to every points. The valid
POIs are therefore the points labelled as yes by the participant. The
points labeled no are as well crucial to the evaluation framework.

The second step aims at extracting the number of true positives,
false positives, true negatives and false negatives that will enable us
to compute the true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate
(1 - specificity) in order to formulate the ROC (Receiver Operating
Characteristic) curve. In order to perform this step, we will use a
parameter d that will help to determine if a cluster is located in a
validation zone around a point of the ground-truth. The validation
results are described in the column Distance Validation in Figure 18.
The true positives (TP) have a ground-truth validation and a distance
validation that correspond to Yes, while the true negatives (TN) have
a ground-truth validation and a distance validation that are equal
to No. The false positives have a ground-truth validation value that
is equal to No and a distance validation value to Yes. Similarly the
false negatives posses contrary labels to the above.
The ROC curve is computed with the true positive rate, indicated
on the y-axis, and true negative rate, indicated on the x-axis.

The first step consists in linking each point of the ground-truth
with a corresponding cluster, which was extracted by the clustering
algorithm. To do so, we will find the closest cluster to each point of
the ground-truth by computing the euclidian distance between them.
The output of step one is illustrated in Figure 17.

research works in the same area [35, 30] and the more plausible

Results

The results of our comparative analysis are shown in Figures 19,
20, 21 and 22 for k-means, DBSCAN, DJ Cluster and DT Cluster
respectively. It is crucial to notice that the diagonal (the light gray
dotted line from the bottom left corner to the top right corner) on
each graph represents the worst case situation in which the algorithm
has no discrimination capability to identify a cluster as a POI. Regarding k-means in Figure 19, increasing the k marginally increases
the performance until reaching a limit whereafter the performance
gain halts. As observed in Figure 20, DBSCAN depicts a better performance as compared to k-means. DBSCAN introduces the notion
of density of the neighborhood of each point evaluated, which increases the accuracy compared to the k-means The lower the epsilon

algorithmic performance. We also observe that DJ cluster performs
better as compared to both DBSCAN and k-means (see Figure 21).
Furthermore, the parameter minPts when set to the least number
provides the best results This can be justified based on the lower values of the radius r (i.e., 60 meters) in addition to deletion of all the
moving points. DT Cluster provides the best overall performance
as observed in Figure 22 We also notice that the highest value of
parameter d (i.e., 300 meters) is not necessarily correlated with the
best performance Based on these results we can conclude that the
clustering approaches account for the spatiotemporal parameters are
comparatively better adapt to extract POIs.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we introduce a feature rich geolocation mobility
dataset Breadcrumbs. In addition to fine-grained demographic attributes, contact and calendar records, social relationships we also
provide ground truth and semantic labels for the points of interest.
We describe the complete data collection process and our methodology to collect ground-truth information in GIS domain. Our
qualitative analysis has shed light on several aspects of this dataset
including the POI connectivity, WiFI connection recurrence, POI
distribution. We specify the use cases, applicable research domains
and validation methodologies using the unique features of Breadcrumbs. In addition, we have also highlighted the utility of health
related information and transportation modes preferences. To showcase a use case of our dataset, we have performed a comparative
study of four clustering approaches to extract POI cluster from GPS
trajectories. We have proposed a validation methodology while using the ground-truth labels illustrated the obtained results. We learn
that DT Clustering outperforms DJ cluster, DBSCAN and k-means
and we discuss its implication. We make Breadcrumbs accessible to
the research community in order to facilitate and advance the GIS
research.
