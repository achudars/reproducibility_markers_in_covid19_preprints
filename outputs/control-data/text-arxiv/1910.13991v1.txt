Quantum states can acquire a phase called the Berry phase after adiabatically traversing a closed
loop in parameter space. This phase is geometric – dependent on the path – not the rate of motion.
Wilczek and Zee extended this concept to include non-Abelian phases that can be characterized the
Wilson loop, a gauge independent quantity. Here we quantum-engineer a non-Abelian SU(2) gauge
field for an atomic Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), in a 5-dimensional “synthetic” parameter space
derived from internal atomic degrees of freedom. By slowly encircling a topological monopole, we
observed the adiabatic Wilczek-Zee phase that we characterize in terms of the Wilson loop.

The seemingly abstract geometry of a quantum system’s eigenstates now finds application in fields ranging
from condensed-matter and high-energy physics to quantum information science. For example, the topological
classification of crystalline materials derives from such
geometric quantities (Berry curvature) integrated over
a closed manifold such as a crystal’s Brillouin zone [1].
The Berry phase – a geometric phase acquired as a single (non-degenerate) quantum state follows a closed loop
(i.e. cyclic motion) in any parameter space [2] – provides a prime observable associated with this geometry.
It has been measured in a variety of physical systems,
and the concept, including extensions to non-adiabatic
and non-cyclic motion, as well as to mixed states appears
throughout physics and chemistry [3–7].
In 1984, Wilczek and Zee [8] extended Berry’s idea
to include non-Abelian geometric phases by considering cyclic evolution of states within a degenerate manifold. Following the initial nuclear magnetic resonance
experiments [9, 10], the non-Abelian geometric phase
inspired holonomic quantum computation that utilizes
the operator-valued Wilczek-Zee (W.-Z.) phase to affect
noise-resistant geometric quantum gates [11]. Holonomic
quantum gates have been demonstrated both in the adiabatic limit [12] and in the diabatic limit [13–15]. However, despite the universality of Wilczek and Zee’s concept, there were only a few observations [12, 16, 17] of
adiabatic W.-Z. phase in any physical system, and even
with many proposals [18–24] this phase has not been observed for ultracold atoms.

In this Article, we observed and characterized the W.Z. phase in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. This
phase was acquired from near-adiabatic evolution of
the quantum state within a degenerate manifold, built
in the synthetic dimensional parameter space derived
from rf and microwave coupled atomic hyperfine states.

Time evolution in the degenerate manifold was governed
by a non-Abelian SU(2) gauge field. Our scheme utilized a degenerate subspace (DS) of the system’s Hilbert
space, that was insensitive to noise, including environmental magnetic field fluctuation. We confirmed the nonAbelian operator character of the W.-Z. phase factor using quantum process tomography, and characterized it
in terms of the gauge-independent Wilson loop. The
Wilson loop is not uniquely defined: in the condensedmatter literature the non-Abelian holonomy Û is used
synonymously with the Wilson loop, whereas in other
contexts such as high-energy physics, tr(Û ) is associated
with the Wilson loop. Both conventions are present in
the quantum-gas literature, and we have adopted the latter definition. We further show that even for the same
path, these geometric properties depend on the direction
the path is followed.
Berry showed that, for a single non-degenerate energy
state, the Abelian Berry connection (gauge field) is gauge
dependent [2], but both the Berry phase and Berry curvatures are gauge independent. These quantities are invariant under gauge transformation by unitary operation
U = eiΦ(q) that depends on position-dependent phase
Φ(q) in the parameter space. In a degenerate manifold,
where the gauge field is generally non-Abelian, the nonAbelian extensions of Berry’s phase and curvatures are
no longer gauge invariant. The Wilson loop, defined as
trace of the W.-Z. phase factor (non-Abelian holonomy)
is an important non-local gauge-independent geometric
quantity. It was originally considered for the problem of
quark-confinement [25, 26] and has been often used in formulating gauge theories. In topological quantum computation, Wilson loop describes braiding evolution of nonAbelian anyons [27, 28]. Moreover, in crystalline systems
– including both conventional materials and synthetic
quantum matter – the eigenspectrum of the Wilson loop
can characterize the topology of the Bloch bands [29, 30].
Ultracold atoms subject to non-Abelian gauge potentials
enable well-controlled experiments exploring a range of

quantum state is adiabatically changed along a path C in the base space, the parallel transport condition sets vertical lift along
the fiber. The final state |Ψf i after closing the path is different from the initial state |Ψi i by a factor of the holonomy UC due
to the acquisition of W.-Z. phase. This state evolution in our degenerate subspace can be represented by the trajectory of the
Bloch vector.

geometric and topological phenomena [31–34] for application in quantum simulation. In this present work we use
this control to present the first measurement of the Wilson loop for adiabatic motion within a degenerate manifold.
In the framework of differential geometry [35], adiabatic motion is described in terms of fiber bundles, where
the fibers represent the gauge degree of freedom. As the
state adiabatically evolves, the parallel transport condition sets the choice of basis state, which leads to vertical
lift along the fiber (Fig. 1c). After tracing out a closed
loop C in space, the state will have evolved according to
the unitary transformation

which is the W.-Z. geometric phase factor, i.e., the nonAbelian holonomy. Here P indicates that the exponential should be evaluated in a path-ordered manner and
Âq is the non-Abelian gauge field (non-Abelian Berry
connection). The Wilson loop W = tr(Û ) is manifestly
gauge independent, and for a single non-degenerate en-

ergy level, it reduces to Berry’s phase factor.
Our experiments began with an optically trapped 87 Rb
BEC, from which we engineered a non-Abelian SU(2)
gauge field by cyclically coupling four hyperfine ground
states [34]. The four spin states – |F, mF i = |1, 0i(≡
|1i), |1, −1i(≡ |2i), |2, 1i(≡ |3i) and |2, 0i(≡ |4i) – were
coupled with rf and microwave fields parameterized by
two Rabi frequencies ΩA and ΩB with phases φA and φB
[See Fig. 1b]. The system then evolved according to the
Hamiltonian

expressed in terms of the five Dirac gamma matrices
Γ̂i , where the vector q = (q1 , q2 , q3 , q4 , q5 ) defines coordinates in a five-dimensional parameter space and ~ is
the reduced Plank constant. Here the five-dimensional
control vector q is determined by laboratory parameters
q1 = −ΩB cos φB , q2 = −ΩA cos φA , q3 = −ΩA sin φA ,
q4 = 0, and q5 = −ΩB sin φB .
We focused on the near-adiabatic control of the rf
phase φA for a range of coupling ratios (ΩB /ΩA = tan θ2 )

at fixed microwave phase φB = 0. The energy spectrum always consisted of a pair of two-fold degenerate
energy manifolds with eigenstates {| ↑− (q)i, | ↓− (q)i}
for the ground state manifold and {| ↑+ (q)i, | ↓+ (q)i}
for the excited state manifold. The energy gap was measured by inducing coherent Rabi-like oscillations between
the eigenstates.
p Throughout this manuscript, the gap
(∆E(q) = ~ Ω2A + Ω2B ) is h × 2.0 kHz. Due to the twofold DS, the underlying gauge field Â is non-Abelian and
has SU(2) symmetry. When q is adiabatically changed
along a closed path, the quantum state evolves within
the subspace and acquires W.-Z. phases. This geometric
process can be viewed as a hypothetical particle moving acquired around the non-Abelian Yang monopole,
which can be regarded as a source of the SU(2) gauge
field [34, 36].

The consequence of the acquired W.-Z. phase can be
experimentally captured by explicitly following an initial state as it evolves within the DS as a result of adiabatically moving q in parameter space. To this end,
we√first prepared one of the eigenstates (| ↑− (q0 )i =
1/ 2|1i − 1/2|2i + 1/2|4i) at q0 = (−ΩB , −ΩA , 0, 0, 0)
in the ground state manifold. After the state preparation, we linearly ramped the rf phase (φA (t) = 2πt/T ,
where T = 2 ms), tracing out the closed loop C+ shown
in the left panel of Fig. 2a. We perform state tomography within the DS to compare the final state with the
initial state (See Methods).
The state within the DS is captured by the Bloch vector in a Bloch sphere. The states before and after the
control sequence are shown in the right panel of Fig. 2a.
It can be clearly seen that the Bloch vector is rotated
even though the final control parameters are the same
as the initial ones, manifesting the matrix nature of the
W.-Z. phase factor’s representation. This is striking in
contrast with the Abelian Berry phase, which would leave
the orientation on the Bloch sphere unchanged.
The consequence of the geometric phase acquisition
also depends on the direction of the ramp. For the
Abelian case, a reversed ramp along the same loop results in the same phase with its sign flipped. However,
for the non-Abelian case, this relation does not hold. Figure 2b shows the experimental result for reversed phase
ramp along the same path, where the final state is rotated in a different way. We denote the motion along the
same path in different directions by C+ for the phaseincreasing ramp and C− for the reversed ramp. In the
following sections, we will see that the seemingly unrelated results between the opposite ramps can be captured
by process tomography and Wilson loop measurement.

FIG. 2.
Acquisition of W.-Z. phase within the degenerate subspace. a (Left panel) Schematic of the control sequence for observing W.-Z phase for the path C+ . A
microwave and rf pulse rotate the control field from qN k
(0, 0, 0, 1, 0) to q0 to prepare the eigenstate at q0 (red curve).
The control vector q traces out a closed loop C by linearly ramping the rf phase for time duration T , such that
q(t) = (−ΩB , −ΩA cos(2πt/T ), −ΩA sin(2πt/T ), 0, 0) (blue
curve). The state is mapped to qN for state read-out by
applying another pulse (green curve). The preparation and
mapping pulse give one-to-one correspondence between the
state within the DS at q0 and qN . For illustrative purpose, only three dimensions in the control field space are
shown. (Right panel) Bloch vector within the DS measured after the control sequence for the path C+ is compared
with the initial one hσ̂i = (0, 0, 1) (blue arrows). The final Bloch vector was hσ̂i = (−0.62(3), −0.70(5), 0.47(2)) (red
arrows). b (Left panel) The control sequence for observing W.-Z phase for the path C− , which takes the opposite
ramp direction for tracing out the loop C. (Right panel)
The initial hσ̂i = (0, 0, 1) (blue arrow) and the final Bloch
vectors hσ̂i = (−0.68(1), 0.59(5), 0.40(5)) (red arrows) after
tracing out a loop are shown. The laboratory parameters are
ΩA = ΩB = h × 1.4kHz.

To fully characterize the process accompanying the W.Z. phase acquisition, we perform quantum process tomography [37, 38] within the ground state DS. An arbitrary
transformation (operation) on a quantum system with
initial density operator ρ̂ini can P
be described by the action
of Kraus operators K̂k : ρ̂fin = k K̂k ρ̂ini K̂k† . The Kraus
operators K̂k completely describe the whole process,
and can
P be expanded by a basis for operators {Êi } as
K̂k = i cki Êi , where cki (∈ C) is the coefficient. Thus,
the density operator encoding the state within the DS

transforms as ρ̂fin = i,j Êi ρ̂P
ini Êj χij , with weights given
by the process matrix χij = k cki c∗kj . In the following,
we take {Êi } = {Iˆ0 , σ̂x , σ̂y , σ̂z } as the basis. The process
matrix χ completely and uniquely represents our experimental W.-Z. phase acquisition process. In theory, its element χij is analytically obtained from the non-Abelian
W.-Z. phase factor Û as χij = tr(Û Êi )tr(Û Êj )∗ /4.
We experimentally obtain the process matrix χ by repeating the measurement illustrated in Fig. 2 for fourindependent initial states
√ (|Ai = | ↑− (q0 )i, |Bi√= | ↓−
(q0 )i, |Ci = (|Ai + |Bi) 2, |Di = (|Ai + i|Bi) 2) and
applying maximum likelihood estimation to obtain physical χ, which is positive semi-definite and Hermite (See
Methods).
Figure 3a, b illustrate the reconstructed process matrices of the non-Abelian W.-Z. phase obtained for the
forward and the reverse ramps at θ2 = π/4. The two re-

sults for opposite ramps along the same path show that
the real part of χ takes almost the same values, whereas
the imaginary parts of χ have the opposite sign. This
trend can be explained from the definition of the W.-Z.
phase (Eq. (1)) satisfying the relation ÛC+ = ÛC†− and
thus χij (C+ ) = χ∗ij (C− ) for the process matrices of the
non-Abelian W.-Z. phase. The above behavior of the
process matrix elements holds for different coupling ratios (i.e. θ2 ) as shown in Fig. 3c, where different kinds
of non-Abelian W.-Z. phases are realized. The result,
which is in stark contrast to the Abelian Berry phase, is
in excellent agreement with the generalized relation for
holonomy.
The process matrix allows us to evaluate the fidelity
of our holonomic control within the DS. Using the analytical expression for the non-Abelian holonomy ÛC , the
fidelity of the process shown in Fig. 3 a, b reached as high
as FC + = 0.98 for forward ramp and FC − = 0.96 for reverse ramp even for finite ramp time. Here the fidelity is
defined as F = tr(χth χ), where χth is theoretical process
matrix assuming adiabaticity. The high fidelity, which is
realized by focusing on the DS, enabled us to characterize
the W.-Z. phase with high accuracy. It has been argued
that the non-adiabatic effect does not contribute to the
state evolution in the DS up to first order, even though
the state deflects from the adiabatic limit [34, 39].

All the above measurements depend on the choice of
the basis, i.e. gauge, whereas the Wilson loop does not.
From the process matrix components measured in Fig. 3,
√
the absolute value of the Wilson loop is |WC | = 2 χ11 .
Figure 4 shows |WC | for forward (C+ ) and reverse ramp
(C− ) as the path C is varied by changing coupling ratio (ΩA /ΩB ). The theoretical relation for the opposite
ramp on the same path (|WC+ | = |WC− |) can be clearly
observed in experimental data, which also shows good
agreement with the analytical curve for adiabatic control.
At θ2 = 0, the geometric phase is simply ÛC = −Iˆ0 and
WC± = −2 resulting from simultaneous control of twolevel systems, acquiring the Berry phase of ±π. The experimental result shows the maximum change of the possible |WC | (i.e from 0 to 2), manifesting the non-Abelian
nature of the geometric property. Since the system is
time-reversal invariant, the global phase factor should be
±nπ (n is an integer) and the Wilson loop’s value is real.
The Wilson loop is robust against some perturbation.
Although circular paths is chosen here, the Wilson loop
is unchanged as long as the path in the polar coordinate
(Ω, φA ) encloses the topological Yang monopole.
The eigenvalues of the W.-Z. phase factor can be
also evaluated from our measurement. Since holonomy
is a unitary operator, the magnitude of its eigenvalues is always one. By defining λ1 and λ2 as the argument of the complex eigenvalues, the relation WC =

FIG. 4. Measurement of Wilson loop and eigenvalues
of W.-Z phase factor. a Absolute values of the Wilson
loop along the closed path C are measured for forward (WC+ ,
blue diamonds) and reverse ramps (WC− , red circles). At
θ2 = π/2, the circular paths converge to a point, where we
also measure with T =0 (a green diamond). Theory curves
for |WC± | (solid line) are also shown. b The phase difference
of the eigenvalues of W.-Z phase factor |δλC± | obtained from
the Wilson loop measurement in a. The phases for forward
(|δλC+ |, blue diamonds) and reverse ramps (|δλC− |, red circles) are shown with theory curves for |δλC± | (solid line). The
reference point at π/2 is also shown (a green diamond). The
eigenvalues satisfy WC = exp(iλ1 ) + exp(iλ2 ) as graphically
illustrated in the inset. In the complex plane, the eigenvalues
appear on the unit circle (pink and green points), and the
sum gives the Wilson loop (red arrow). As our system has
time-reversal symmetry, λ1 = −λ2 is met. The pair of phases
are determined up to phase uncertainty in nπ, where n is an
integer. At θ2 = π/6, the phases are λ1 = −λ2 = π/2 + nπ,
where the pair of eigenvalues are determined to be {−i, i}.

exp(iλ1 ) + exp(iλ2 ) is met. Thus, the Wilson loop is
a measure of the phase difference of these eigenvalues,
which is also gauge-independent. We extract the phase
difference δλ = |λ1 − λ2 | ∈ [0, π] from the Wilson loop
measurement, showing good agreement with the theory
(see Fig. 4 b). By noting that our system is time-reversal
invariant (TRI), Wilson loop is real and λ1 = −λ2 is satisfied. Thus, eigenvalues of W.-Z. phase factor can be
measured from Wilson loop for TRI system.
Finally, we show measurement on the Wilson line
on open paths by observing non-cyclic W.-Z. phases.
The non-cyclic W.-Z. phases is defined by simply re-

placing the closed path for the integral in Eq. (1)
with an open path C. The Wilson line, defined as
the trace of the non-cyclic W.-Z. phase factor, is not
gauge-independent, and thus it depends on the choice
of the basis at both ends of the path. The experimental procedure is the same as the Wilson loop measurement, except the rf phase ramp is halted at variable
phase φA = φ ranging from 0 to 2π. After preparing the eigenstates at q0 , we ramp the control vector
as q(t) = (−ΩB , −ΩA cos(2πt/T ), −ΩA sin(2πt/T ), 0, 0)
for t = [0, φT /2π] until the control vector reaches qf =
(−ΩB , −ΩA cos φ, −ΩA sin φ, 0, 0). The final state within
the DS at qf is always mapped to the DS at q = q0
for the state tomography. By performing the process
tomography for the four-independent initial eigenstates,
the process matrix of the non-cyclic non-Abelian geometric phase is reconstructed in the same manner as in Fig. 3
for each phase. Figure 5 shows the obtained Wilson lines
from the reconstructed process matrices for a choice of
the basis states based on our experimental procedure (See
Method). The Wilson line is trivially WC = 2 at φ = 0
and becomes gauge-independent at φ = 2π where the
trajectory is closed.
The whole unitary process including the state preparation and the state mapping processes can be viewed as
a local gauge transformation of the W.-Z phase: ÛC →
V (qf )ÛC V † (q0 ) = −Ûmap (φ)ÛC Ûprep , where V (q) is a
position-dependent unitary operator, and Ûprep (Ûmap )
is a unitary operator that represents the pulse that maps
the state within the DS at qN (qf ) to the state within the
DS at q0 . This clearly illustrates that the Wilson line is
gauge-independent only when qf = q0 , where it becomes
equivalent to the Wilson loop.

In conclusion, we observed cyclic and non-cyclic W.Z phases acquired from a non-Abelian gauge field, the
source of which is a Yang monopole located at q = 0.
Due to the high SO(5) symmetry around the monopole in
five-dimensional space, the Wilson loop is robust against
some deformation of the path. By varying the closed
path, we explored the whole range of the Wilson loop,
showing essentially the full set of the SU(2) holonomic
control. Additional Ramsey interference measurements
will allow for determination of the sign of the Wilson
loop. Moreover, the combination of rf and microwave
phase control will enable us to verify the non-commuting
nature of W.-Z. phases. The rf and microwave coupling
used here can be replaced with a set of Raman lasers to
realize non-Abelian SU(2) gauge field, where various exotic many-body phenomena are accessible using ultracold
atoms [40]. Our coupling and measurement scheme can
be broadly extended to other quantum systems including
trapped ions, superconducting qubits, NV centers and
other solid-state spins, where equivalent coupling is possible. Therefore, our present work may pave the way

Observation and characterization of a non-Abelian gauge field’s Wilczek-Zee phase by
the Wilson loop

Atom preparation and atom number counting
Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of rubidium-87 of ≈ 1 × 105 were prepared in a crossed optical dipole trap
formed by two horizontal 1064 nm optical trapping beams with the trapping frequencies (fx , fy , fz ) ≈ (50, 110, 70)
Hz, where the y-axis is along the direction of gravity. Initially, the BECs were prepared in the |1, −1i state. Atoms
were then transferred to prepare a superposition state of |1, 0i and |2, 0i by rf and microwave pulses, which is the
ground state of our Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) at qN . The bias magnetic field of 19.8 G pointing along the z-axis was
stabilized for long term drift at 2.5 ppm.
We performed an absorption imaging and Stern-Gerlach measurements to resolve the atoms in the hyperfine ground
states. After the rf and microwave control was finished, we abruptly turned off the optical dipole trap beams for timeof-flight (TOF). During the TOF, a magnetic field gradient pulse was applied to perform Stern-Gerlach measurement,
which separated atoms in |1, 0i and |2, 0i from those in |1, 1i and |2, −1i in space. We imaged the atoms in F = 2
manifold by illuminating a probe pulse resonant to 5S1/2 , F = 2 → 5P3/2 , F = 3 transition after TOF of 23.2 ms. A
short repump laser pulse resonant wit the 5S1/2 , F = 1 → 5P3/2 , F = 2 transition was applied before the probe pulse
in order to image atoms in F = 1 and F = 2 manifolds. When we focused on the state in ground DS, we apply a
π-pulse resonant with the microwave transition |1, 0i ↔ |2, 1i to swap the population between the two states right
before the TOF and only measure atoms in the F = 2 manifold. This allowed us to measure the relative population
(N↑ − N↓ )/(N↑ + N↓ ) with a single shot image. Here N↑ (N↓ ) is the atom number in | ↑i = |1, 0i(| ↓i = |2, 0i) state
before the microwave π-pulse was applied.

The Dirac matrices
As the representation of the Dirac matrices, we take Γˆ1 = σ̂2 ⊗ σ̂2 , Γˆ2 = Iˆ0 ⊗ σ̂1 , Γˆ3 = σ̂3 ⊗ σ̂2 , Γˆ4 = Iˆ0 ⊗ σ̂3
and Γˆ5 = σ̂1 ⊗ σ̂2 . Here σ̂i , (i = x, y, z) are the Pauli operators, Iˆ0 is the identity operator, and ⊗ is the Kronecker
product. Each Dirac matrix has eigenvalues of ±1, each of which is two-fold degenerate.

Pulse control for state preparation and state mapping
The unitary operator corresponding to the rf and microwave pulse used for the state preparation and the state
mapping is govern by the following time-independent Hamiltonian that describes the cyclic coupling with π/2 different
choice of the rf and microwave phases.
~
Ĥmap (q) = − (q1 γˆ1 + q2 γˆ2 + q3 γˆ3 + q5 γˆ4 ),
2

(S1)

Here γˆ1 = σ̂2 ⊗ σ̂1 , γˆ2 = −Iˆ0 ⊗ σ̂2 , γˆ3 = −σ̂3 ⊗ σ̂1 , γˆ4 = σ̂1 ⊗ σ̂1 . The unitary evolution during the pulsing is then
Ûtrans (t, q) = exp (−iĤmap (q)t),

(S2)

where
pt is the pulse duration, and the state oscillates at a period determined by the energy gap (∆E). For tprep =
π/(2 Ω2A + Ω2B ), the basis states at qN , which are
p | ↑i = |1i and | ↓i = |3i, are mapped to | ↑ (q0 )i and | ↓ (q0 )i
at φA = φB = 0, respectively. For tmap = 3π/(2 Ω2A + Ω2B ), the basis states at q along C, which are | ↑ (q)i and
| ↑ (q))i, are mapped back to | ↑i and | ↓i, respectively. The former pulse operation (Ûtrans (tprep , q0 ) = Ûprep ) is
applied for preparing the eigenstates at q0 before the phase ramp, whereas the latter (Ûtrans (tmap , q) = Ûmap ) is
applied after the phase ramp along the loop C to read out the state.

3
The basis states for the degenerate subspace
We take the following eigenstates for the basis of the ground DS at q for the region in the parameter space we have
experimentally explored (δ = 0, φB = 0, φA ∈ [0, 2π], θ2 ∈ [0, π/2]),
√
| ↑− (q)i = (|1i − e−iφA cos θ2 |2i + sin θ2 |4i)/ 2
(S3)
√
| ↓− (q)i = (− sin θ2 |2i + |3i − eiφA cos θ2 |4i)/ 2
Using the basis states, the pure state within the DS at q is described by
|Ψ(q)i = c↑ | ↑− (q)i + c↓ | ↓− (q)i,

(S4)

which can be represented by a two-component spinor Ψ = (c↑ , c↓ )T , where |c↑ |2 + |c↓ |2 = 1 is met.
Each eigenstate can be prepared by applying the cyclic coupling pulse as described above to one of the bare spin
states.
| ↑− (q)i = Ûtrans (tprep , q)| ↑i,

(S5)

| ↓− (q)i = Ûtrans (tprep , q)| ↓i,

where | ↑i = |1i and | ↓i = |3i is the basis state of the ground DS at qN . Therefore, the four initial eigenstates (|Ai,
|Bi, |Ci and |Di) at q0 can be prepared
by applying the
√ pulse for the duration tprep with the parameter vector q0 to
√
the states | ↑i, | ↓i, (| ↑i + | ↓i)/ 2, and (| ↑i + i| ↓)/ 2, respectively. For the state mapping, the basis states of the
DS at q can be mapped to the bare spin states.
| ↑i = −Ûtrans (tmap , q)| ↑− (q)i,

(S6)

| ↓i = −Ûtrans (tmap , q)| ↓− (q)i,
Quantum state tomography

After the state acquired the W.-Z phase, we measured the final state within the DS by evaluating the Bloch vector
(hσ̂x (q)i, hσ̂y (q)i, hσ̂z (q)i). Here the Pauli operators are defined from the basis states of the DS at q.
Using the state mapping procedure described above, the target Bloch vector is obtained by performing state
tomography for the superposition states in the microwave clock transition (|1, 0i ↔ |2, 0i). The z-component was
obtained from the population imbalance (N↑ − N↓ )/(N↑ + N↓ ). The x or y-component was obtained by rotating the
Bloch vector with a π/2-pulse with an appropriate microwave phase before measuring the population imbalance.
Quantum process tomography using maximum likelihood estimation
In order to the find physical process matrix χ that represents the W.-Z. phase from our measurement, we adopted
maximum likelihood estimation in the quantum process tomography. For the process matrix to be physical, we define
χ as
χ = T † T /tr(T † T ),
where T is the lower triangular matrix of the form

measurements was used for each ρ̂fin,j . We numerically minimize f (t) for the parameter vector t to obtain optimum
T and the process matrix χ.
Synthetic non-Abelian SU(2) gauge field and Wilson loop
Consider a quantum system with a Hamiltonian Ĥ(q) that depends continuously on the position vector q =
(q1 , q2 , . . . ). The system is described by eigenstates and eigenenergies
Ĥ(q)|Ψnα (q)i = En (q)|Ψnα (q)i,

(S10)

where |Ψnα (q)i (α = 1, 2, , Nα ) is Nα -fold degenerate eigenstate with energy En forming an Nα -fold degenerate
subspace. For quantum states in a single energy level En , a gauge potential called the Berry connection
Aαβ
qm (q) = ihΨα (q)|∂/∂qm |Ψβ (q)i,

(S11)

is encoded in the systemsEeigenstates, where Aαβ
qm is the m-th component of the vector gauge field A represented as
Nα -by-Nα matrix. Here, we omitted n in the l.h.s. for simplicity, and the matrix indices take α, β ∈ {1, 2, · · · , Nα }.
The gauge field (Berry connection) is non-Abelian when two components of the gauge field do not commute with each
other.
Now, we consider the gauge field for the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2). We focus on the parameters relevant to the
experiment (ΩA = Ω cos θ2 , ΩB = sin θ2 , δ = 0, and φB = 0). The non-Abelian SU(2) Berry connection for the
two-fold degenerate ground states is

The dependence on the ramp direction for the W.-Z. phase factors (ÛC+ = ÛC†− ), and the Wilson loops (WC+ = WC∗− )
can be clearly seen. Both the W.-Z. phases factor and the Wilson loop do not depend on Ω, thus they are robust
against fluctuation in the coupling strength. By varying the rf phase φA , the SU(2) Wilson loop covers the full range
(−2 ≤ WC ≤ 2), realizing various non-Abelian SU(2) holonomic controls.
Wilson line for an open path
In the following we give an argument on non-cyclic W.-Z. phase and Wilson line for an open path. The definition
for non-cyclic W.-Z. phase and Wilson line are essentially the same as the cyclic case, except the integral is taken
over for an open path C.

where V̂ (q) is a position-dependent unitary operator. This can be regard as a change in the basis states for the DS.
Accordingly, the non-cyclic W.-Z. phase factor transforms as

(S17)

where q0 and qf are the start point and end point of the open path C, respectively. Manifestly, the r.h.s depends
on the unitary operators, V̂ (q0 ) and V̂ (qf ). When the trace is closed (q0 = qf ), the Wilson line is equivalent to the
Wilson loop and is gauge-independent.

Non-adiabatic effect due to finite ramp time

Although we have focused on evolution within the ground-state manifold, a small fraction of atoms can be populated
to the excited state manifold due to the finite ramp time. We experimentally confirmed this by measuring the fraction
of atoms in the excited state manifold. After the state mapping, we evaluated the fraction Ne /(Ne + Ng ), where
Ne = N|2i + N|4i is the atom number in the excited state manifold, Ng = N|1i + N|3i is the atom number in the
ground state manifold, and N|ii is the atom number in the bare spin state |ii, (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). The observed fraction
of atoms, which depends on the initial state is negligibly small, and consistent with the numerical simulation (See
Fig. S1a). Longer ramp time led to a smaller fraction in the excited state manifold as confirmed by the numerical
simulation [Fig. S1qb]. Experimentally, the fidelity of the our holonomic control is expected to be degraded for longer
ramp time due to the small but finite energy gap opening in the nearly-degenerate levels, which we assume to be
about 1% of the energy gap of the system.

time T for tracing out the loop, the non-adiabatic effect is non-negligible when the ramp rate becomes comparable to the scale
of the energy gap (∆E = h × 2 kHz).

6
Surprisingly, the fidelity in the W.-Z. phase measurement within the DS is robust against small non-adiabatic effect.
Fig. S2 shows the numerically obtained fidelity of the W.-Z. phase by varying the ramp time. For our experimental
parameters with θ2 = π/4, the fidelity reaches 0.998% at T =2 ms.

Measurement of the energy gap

Population imbalance

The energy gap can be clearly measured by inducing coherent Rabi-like oscillations between the eigenstates. Figure S3 shows that the time evolution of the population imbalance (Ne − Ng )/(Ne + Ng ) after abruptly turning on
the cyclic coupling described by the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2). Since the system has only two eigenenergies, the state
oscillates between the ground and excited eigenstates at the frequency determined by the energy gap.
