ABSTRACT

A minority of the optically selected quasar population are red at optical wavelengths
due to the presence of dust along the line-of-sight. A key focus of many red quasar
studies is to understand their relationship with the overall quasar population: are they
blue quasars observed at a (slight) inclination angle or do they represent a transitional
phase in the evolution of quasars? Identifying fundamental differences between red and
blue quasars is key to discriminate between these two paradigms. To robustly explore
this, we have uniformly selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with midinfrared counterparts, carefully controlling for luminosity and redshift effects. We take
a novel approach to distinguish between colour-selected quasars in the redshift range of
0.2 < z < 2.4 by constructing redshift-sensitive g ∗ −i ∗ colour cuts. From cross-matching
this sample to the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST)
survey, we have found a factor ≈ 3 larger fraction of radio-detected red quasars with
respect to that of blue quasars. Through a visual inspection of the FIRST images
and an assessment of the radio luminosities (rest-frame L1.4 GHz and L1.4 GHz /L6µm )
we find that the radio-detection excess for red quasars is primarily due to compact
and radio-faint systems (around the radio quiet–radio loud threshold). We show that
our results rule out orientation as the origin for the differences between red and blue
quasars and argue that they provide broad agreement with an evolutionary model.

INTRODUCTION

Quasars, often referred to as Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs),
represent the most luminous subset of the overall population
of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Their prodigious output
(bolometric luminosities up to 1047 erg s−1 ) is indicative of
rapid accretion, at or near the Eddington limit, onto a supermassive black hole (BH; 109 M ) that resides at the heart
of the host galaxy. Quasars radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to X-rays. The primary emission
comes from the accretion onto the BH (in the form of an
accretion disc) which produces thermal emission at ultraviolet (UV)–optical wavelengths. Surrounding the accretion
disc is a geometrically and optically thick structure of cold
molecular gas and dust (commonly referred to as the dusty
“torus”) which obscures a direct view of the accretion disc
from some viewing angles. The dust in the “torus” is heated
by the accretion disc and emits thermally at mid-infrared
wavelengths (MIR; 5 – 40 µm), dropping off steeply to the

far-infrared band (FIR; 40 – 500 µm; e.g. Elvis et al. 1994;
Richards et al. 2006b; Netzer et al. 2007; Mullaney et al.
2011). In the radio waveband (>1 cm) emission produced
by relativistic jets emerging from the vicinity of the black
hole (BH) is sometimes detected; overall ≈ 5–10% of optically selected quasars are powerful in the radio waveband
(e.g. Condon et al. 2013).
A standard spectroscopic signature of a quasar is the
presence of broad emission lines superimposed onto a blue
power-law continuum. However, the discovery of a subset of
quasars with redder continuum emission (i.e., red optical/IR
colours) has challenged the conventional view. Despite many
studies in the literature (e.g. Rieke et al. 1982; Webster et al.
1995; Benn et al. 1998; Kim & Elvis 1999; Francis et al. 2000;
Richards et al. 2003; Glikman et al. 2004, 2007, 2012; Urrutia
et al. 2009; Banerji et al. 2012; Stern et al. 2012; Assef et al.
2013; Ross et al. 2015; LaMassa et al. 2016; Tsai & Hwang
2017; Kim & Im 2018), the nature of red quasars remains
uncertain. The majority of studies ascribe the red colours
as due to dust-reddening of the accretion-disc emission (e.g.
Webster et al. 1995; Wilkes et al. 2002; Glikman et al. 2004,

2

L. Klindt

2007; Rose et al. 2013; Kim & Im 2018). Nonetheless, depending on the selection and luminosity of the quasar, the
red colours can also be due to (1) an excess of flux at longer
wavelengths either from a red synchrotron component or
the “contamination” of starlight from the host galaxy (e.g.
Serjeant 1996; Benn et al. 1998; Francis et al. 2000; Whiting et al. 2001), or (2) an intrinsically red continuum due
to differences in the accretion disc and/or Eddington ratio
when compared to normal quasars (e.g. Richards et al. 2003;
Young et al. 2008).
Ever since the first focused studies of red quasars over
20 years ago there has been debate over the relationship
between red and blue quasars. If the red-blue quasar dichotomy is equivalent to that between nearby obscured and
unobscured AGN then the different optical colours will be
largely due to the orientation of an anisotropic obscuring
structure (i.e., the dusty “torus”; e.g., Antonucci 1993; Urry
& Padovani 1995). In this scenario red quasars will be more
obscured by dust since they are viewed at inclinations closer
to the equatorial plane of the dusty “torus” than blue quasars
(i.e., a red quasar is simply an inclined blue quasar whereby
the observed viewing angle intersects a larger column of
dust).
Alternatively, a competing paradigm postulates that
red and blue quasars are related within an evolutionary sequence that connects dust-obscured star formation
(SF) with quasar activity through gas inflow and outflow/feedback (e.g., Sanders et al. 1988; Hopkins et al.
2008; Alexander & Hickox 2012). With this model the rare
red quasar population represents a brief transitional phase
(a few tens of Myr; Hopkins et al. 2008) between the
dust-obscured SF and the blue quasar phase during which
winds/jets drive away the obscuring dust, ultimately shutting down the SF and revealing an unobscured blue quasar.
Distinguishing between these competing scenarios is a
major focus of red quasar studies. On the basis of emission line kinematics and X-ray analysis, some studies favour
the orientation scenario to explain the nature of red quasars
(e.g., Wilkes et al. 2002; Rose et al. 2013). Conversely,
through a slew of different selection approaches (e.g., optical; near-infrared (NIR); radio) and multi-wavelength analyses, other studies have presented evidence that many red
quasars show the properties expected for the brief evolutionary phase (e.g., Urrutia et al. 2008; Banerji et al. 2012, 2017;
Glikman et al. 2012, 2015): major-merger driven gas inflows,
dust-obscured SF, and energetic outflows. Irregardless of the
fundamental nature of red quasars, all of these studies agree
that the origin of the red quasar colours is due to the obscuration of a blue quasar continuum by dust; however, the
location of the obscuring dust (i.e., in the nucleus versus the
host galaxy) and its origin (i.e., a consequence of the inclination of the dusty “torus” versus the aftermath of a galaxy
major merger event) remains uncertain.
A major challenge in comparing between different red
quasar studies is the broad range of selection approaches
adopted (e.g. Webster et al. 1995; Cutri et al. 2001; Gregg
et al. 2002; Glikman et al. 2007; Banerji et al. 2012; Tsai &
Hwang 2017); e.g., optical–NIR–MIR colour criteria; pointsource morphologies; bright radio emission. Furthermore,
most red quasar studies do not uniformly select a normal
blue quasar sample to provide a reliable “control” to demonstrate that any observed differences (e.g., in redshift, lu-

minosity, BH mass, Eddington ratio) are specific to the
red quasar population rather than being a consequence of
the different selection approaches. To robustly demonstrate
that there are fundamental differences between red and blue
quasars which cannot be attributed just to orientation, the
quasar samples must be selected in a uniform manner, carefully controlling for any additional selection effects.
In this work we have used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS; York et al. 2000) to undertake a uniform selection of
red and blue quasars to search for fundamental differences,
and to hence distinguish between the evolutionary and orientation scenarios. In §2 we outline the multi-wavelength
data we used to construct a quasar parent sample which is
uniform in selection and unbiased in the radio waveband. We
also define our red and blue quasar samples and constrain
the amount of dust obscuration required to produce the optical colours of the red quasars. Based on our findings we
construct luminosity-redshift matched subsamples which we
use throughout the paper as a comparison to the full colourselected quasar subsamples. In §3.1 we explore the radio
properties of red and blue quasars and find that red quasars
show an enhanced radio-detection fraction in comparison to
blue quasars across all redshifts. In §3.2 we investigate the
radio morphologies to determine which morphological structures are associated with the surfeit of radio-detected red
quasars, and in §3.3 we explore the relation between the
radio-detection fraction and the radio luminosity (L1.4 GHz
and L1.4 GHz /L6µm ) of red quasars. Overall we find a significant enhancement in the detection of compact and faint
radio sources in the red quasar population, a result that becomes stronger towards radio-quiet quasars. These results
strongly argue against a simple orientation model but are
in broad agreement with an evolutionary model, which we
discuss in §4. In this work we adopted a concordance flat
Λ-cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 , Ω M = 0.3, and
ΩΛ = 0.7.

DATA SETS AND QUASAR SAMPLE
DEFINITION

In this study we explore the physical properties of red
quasars at 0.2 < z < 2.4 to understand whether they are
intrinsically different to the overall quasar population at the
same epochs. The multi-wavelength data and catalogues we
used to select red and blue quasars are highlighted in §2.1
and the details of our careful selection criteria are described
in §2.2; Figure 1 presents a flowchart that summarizes the
different steps that are taken in defining our full colourselected subsamples. In §2.3 we utilise the MIR emission as
a robust tracer of the nuclear power of quasars and define a
L6µm −z matched sample to minimise luminosity and redshift
effects on our results.
2.1

Multi-wavelength data and catalogues

Our quasar selection is based on the SDSS DR7 Quasar
Catalogue (Schneider et al. 2010). We utilise this catalogue in combination with MIR data from the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010) and radio data from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at TwentyCentimeters (FIRST; Becker et al. 1995, 2012; Helfand et al.

Figure 1. A schematic diagram of our selection process. We started with quasars from Schneider et al. (2010) and selected those with
the uniform selection flag and excluded sources which were solely targeted for spectroscopic followup due to their FIRST pre-selection;
i.e., sources which were selected only due to having a FIRST counterpart and did not satisfy any of the other selection criteria outlined
in Richards et al. (2002). To construct a parent sample we included sources at redshifts of 0.2 < z < 2.4 with WISE detections in bands
W 1, W 2 and W 3 (SNR > 2), and with bolometric luminosity and BH mass measurements in Shen et al. (2011). The parent sample
was then equally subdivided into the bottom, middle and top 10% of the redshift dependent g∗ − i ∗ distributions representing our full
colour-selected samples termed as bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs, respectively (see Figure 2). Additionally, the bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs
were matched in 6 µm luminosity and redshift to construct L6µm − z matched colour-selected subsamples. Following the colour selection
and luminosity-redshift matching, we searched for FIRST radio counterparts within a 1000 search radius; these samples represent FIRSTdetected quasars termed as FbQSO, FcQSOs and FrQSOs for the FIRST-detected bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs, respectively. The source
statistics for the different subsamples split into redshift bins are tabulated in Table 1.

2.1.1

Optical data: the SDSS DR7 Quasar Catalogue

The SDSS DR7 Quasar Catalogue (Schneider et al. 2010,
hereafter S10) consists of 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with luminosities of Mi < −22.0 out to
z = 5.48 which exhibit at least one emission line with a

hibit broad absorption line features. We briefly describe the
construction of the quasar catalogue below.
The quasar selection algorithm described in Richards
et al. (2002) was used to select primary candidate quasars
for spectroscopic followup (see also Richards et al. 2001;
Stoughton et al. 2002; Schneider et al. 2005; Vanden Berk
et al. 2005). This algorithm distinguishes between quasars
and the much more numerous stars and galaxies by (1) using their nonstellar colours obtained from the u∗ (3543 Å),
g ∗ (4770 Å), r ∗ (6231 Å), i ∗ (7625 Å) and z∗ (9134 Å) broadband photometry and (2) searching for counterparts in the

=
19.1.1 The target colour selection is sensitive to red quasars
(e.g., quasars with E(B − V) = 0.1 have a high probability of being selected; see §2.2 of Richards et al. 2003), although the most reddened quasars will be missed. In addition, non-quasar selection algorithms were used to supplement the primary quasar selection, including (1) objects
with ROSAT All-sky Survey (RASS, Voges et al. 1999, 2000)
counterparts, (2) objects targeted as members of certain
stellar populations (e.g., F stars and Main-sequence turnoff
stars) but whose spectra showed them to be quasars, and
(3) serendipitous objects (FIRST matches or objects with
peculiar colours; see Stoughton et al. 2002; Anderson et al.
2003; Vanden Berk et al. 2005; Richards et al. 2006a; Shen
et al. 2007; Schneider et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2011, for further
details on the SDSS selection algorithms). These candidates
were only assigned fibres once the main samples of galaxies, Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and quasars were tiled.
Hence, these samples are incomplete and in combination
with the inclusion of the “Special Plates” in the Galactic cap
(e.g., Stripe 82 Stoughton et al. 2002; Adelman-McCarthy
et al. 2006), were designed to explore the limits of the primary selection algorithm, to go deeper and to target objects
with atypical colours.
The selection of quasars via earlier versions of the
algorithm or from the Special Plates introduced a nonuniformity in the selection of the S10 quasar sample and,
therefore, approximately half of these objects are not suitable for statistical analyses (Shen et al. 2011; Kratzer &
Richards 2015; Park et al. 2015). However, S10 identify
targets that satisfy a posteriori the Richards et al. (2002)
selection algorithm, indicated with the uniform flag (uniform target = 1; see Shen et al. 2011; Park et al. 2015;
Kratzer & Richards 2015), which provides a statistically reliable sample of 59,514 quasars up to z = 5.48. Of these, only
259 quasars were targeted uniquely by FIRST pre-selection.

2.1.2

Radio data: searching for FIRST counterparts

The VLA Faint Images of the Radio Sky at TwentyCentimeters (FIRST; Becker et al. 1995, 2012; Helfand et al.
2015) is a 1.4 GHz radio survey that observed ≈ 10,000 deg2
of the SDSS region at a spatial resolution of 5 00 . The 5 σ
source detection threshold of 1 mJy makes it beneficial to
detect quasars down to low radio luminosities; i.e., including
even radio-quiet AGN. The FIRST survey comprises 946,432

radio sources of which 30% have a spectroscopic SDSS counterpart (e.g., Ivezić et al. 2002).
When cross-matching between different surveys there is
a trade-off between completeness and the number of false associations. Since the majority of the SDSS quasars are likely
to be unresolved in FIRST, a high completeness and low random association can be achieved even when adopting a small
search radius. Based on the analysis of Lu et al. (2007), we
adopted a 10 00 cross-matching radius. They showed that the
false association rate within 10 00 of the QSO position is only
0.2%, with just 2% of radio quasars in SDSS having radio
structures that extend beyond 10 00 and have an undetected
radio core in FIRST. Therefore, we consider all FIRST radio
sources with centroidal positions within 10 00 of the quasar to
be directly associated, and summed their integrated flux. In
practice only 6% of all our radio-detected quasars have multiple FIRST counterparts treated in this fashion (see §3.2).
To explore our incompleteness to large radio sources we used
additional data from the NVSS (Condon et al. 1998) which
has a beam size of 45 00 , significantly larger than FIRST and
our cross-match radius (§3.2).
We calculated the 1.4 GHz luminosities using the
methodology described in Alexander et al. (2003), assuming a uniform radio spectral index of α = 0.5 to compute a
K-correction (which is the division between steep and flat
radio spectrum quasars; e.g., Wall 1975; Kimball & Ivezić
2008).2 In this work we used the FIRST integrated flux
(Fint ) to compute the radio luminosities and the FIRST peak
flux (Fpeak ) to establish whether a source is radio faint (i.e.,
Fpeak < 3 mJy).

2.1.3

Infrared data: searching for WISE counterparts

To explore the dust properties of red quasars in comparison to blue quasars, we searched for MIR counterparts from
the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright
et al. 2010) which mapped the entire sky in four bands: W1
(λ = 3.4 µm; PSF = 6.1 00 ), W2 (λ = 4.6 µm; PSF = 6.4 00 ), W3
(λ = 12 µm; PSF = 6.5 00 ) and W4 (λ = 22 µm; PSF = 12.0 00 ).
Using the Query Engine from the Infrared Science Archive at
NASA/IPAC we matched the uniformly selected S10 quasars
to the All-Sky WISE Source Catalogue (ALLWISE) within
a 2.7 00 radius. This ensured a 99.5% certainty that the optical source is matched to the correct MIR counterpart (Lake
et al. 2012). We found a WISE counterpart for 58,137 uniformly selected S10 quasars.
Since the MIR emission is a robust tracer of the reprocessed accretion disc emission from dust that is free of the
effects of extinction, we determined the intrinsic luminosities
of the quasars on the basis of the MIR fluxes after ensuring that the MIR emission is not significantly contaminated
by non-AGN processes (see §2.3.1). We computed the restframe 6µm luminosity (L6µm ) by log-linear interpolation or
extrapolation of the fluxes in the W2 and W3 bands, assuming that they are equivalent to monochromatic fluxes at the
effective wavelength of the filters.

et al. (2011).

Fundamental differences between red and blue quasars
2.2

Distinguishing between red and blue quasars:
full colour-selected samples

A variety of different approaches have been adopted in the
literature to select red quasars which makes it difficult to
draw conclusions about their properties with respect to blue
quasars. Our main aim is to construct a carefully controlled
and redshift-sensitive experiment in which both red and blue
quasars are drawn from the same parent sample to allow for
a systematic exploration of their multi-wavelength properties. In §2.2.1 we construct a parent sample using the aforementioned catalogues/surveys and in §2.2.2 we define our
red and blue quasar samples, referred to here as our full
colour-selected samples.
2.2.1

Defining the quasar parent sample

As mentioned in §2.1.1, the SDSS quasar selection approach
is complex which introduces some non-uniformity in the
overall quasar sample. We therefore sought a selection approach which is uniform and minimises radio biases introduced by the FIRST pre-selection of SDSS quasars.
Figure 1 shows a flowchart that summarizes the different
steps we took in defining our parent sample to then select red
and blue quasars (§2.2.2); the source statistics in each sample are reported in Table 1. To construct a uniform parent
sample we, firstly, selected S10 quasars with the uniform flag
and then, using the hexadecimal bit value of the ‘BEST’ flag
(see Stoughton et al. 2002; Schneider et al. 2010), we identified and removed sources pre-selected solely on the basis
of their FIRST detection (bestflag = 0 × 8 for sources at
high Galactic latitude and bestflag = 0 × 10 for sources at
low Galactic latitude).
In addition to uniform selection, our sample is restricted
to the redshift range 0.2 < z < 2.4 and required a SNR > 2 in
the W ISE W1, W2, and W3 bands to allow the estimation of
L6µm . We excluded 70 sources of the uniform sample which
lacked bolometric luminosity measurements. This yielded a
final parent sample of 48,964 quasars that are uniform in
selection and unbiased in the radio waveband within our
selected redshift range.
2.2.2

Defining the full colour-selected samples

To distinguish between red and blue quasars we produced
g ∗ − i ∗ colour distributions of our uniformly selected parent sample (§2.1.3) as a function of redshift. We define red
quasars (rQSOs) and blue quasars (bQSOs) by selecting the
respective reddest 10% and the bluest 10% of the colour
distribution. Additionally we selected the 10% of quasars
around the median of the g ∗ − i ∗ distribution to construct
a control sample (cQSOs). Hereafter we refer to all non-red
quasars (including the bQSO and cQSO subsamples) as blue
quasars.
In Figure 2 we illustrate the selection of the three
colour-selected quasar samples. In order to construct a rQSO
selection which is sensitive to the redshift evolution of quasar
SEDs we sorted the quasars by redshift and constructed the
g ∗ − i ∗ distributions in contiguous redshift bins consisting
of 1000 sources as shown in the zoom-in panel in Figure 2.
We restricted our analysis to z ≤ 2.4 due to the low optical
completeness of quasars in S10 at 2.5 < z < 3.0. This is a

Notes. (1): Target samples used in this study: Parent QSOs represents the uniformly selected S10 quasars with W 1 − W 3 detections, b-, c-, rQSOs are the g∗ − i ∗ colour-selected samples and
F-b-, c-, rQSOs are the radio-bright quasars matched to FIRST
(see Figure 2). (2)–(6): Source statistics for each sample within the
respective redshift bins; i.e., across the full z range in our study,

consequence of the crossing between the stellar and quasar
loci in the SDSS multicolour space (see e.g., Richards et al.
2002). Even though the u∗ − z ∗ colour provides the broadest
wavelength baseline for colour separation, the SDSS photometry in both of these bands is shallow and is more affected by atmospheric attenuation (e.g., Ivezić et al. 2002).
Furthermore, the u∗ -band is heavily affected by the Lyman
break at z ≥ 1.9 which motivates our use of the g ∗ -band
(only influenced at higher redshifts, i.e., z ≥ 2.5).
Therefore, the g ∗ − i ∗ colour was used to select red and
blue quasars with the broadest possible wavelength range
while optimising photometric depth (see e.g., Richards et al.
2003). To verify that our colour selection does indeed reliably identify quasars with red and blue colours, and is not
strongly influenced by broad emission line contamination in
the g ∗ or i ∗ bands, we compared the g ∗ −i ∗ to u∗ −r ∗ colours of
the bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs as shown in Figure 3. We note
that the rQSOs selected using g ∗ − i ∗ are also red in u∗ − r ∗
when comparing to the bQSOs and cQSOs. Approximately
2% of the cQSOs have g ∗ − i ∗ > 0.5 (all of these sources are

at z < 0.3; see Figure 2). However, this is not a failure of
our quasar selection approach and is a natural consequence
of our redshift-sensitive selection technique. Overall, within
the full colour-selected sample there are ≈ 4900 quasars in
each of the bQSO, cQSO, and rQSO sub samples, of which
348, 318, and 821 are radio detected, respectively.

2.2.3

Dust extinction in red quasars

The most common explanation for the optical colours of red
quasars is dust extinction, whether due to the inclination
of a dusty torus resulting from an increase in dust along
the line-of-sight or an obscuring dust envelope in which the
young red quasar is embedded. We note that, due to the optical selection criteria, the SDSS will miss the most reddened
quasars both because of their colours (red quasars overlay
the stellar locus in most SDSS colour-colour diagrams) and
because of the optical survey flux limit (e.g., Glikman et al.
2004; Banerji et al. 2012, use NIR data and select SDSS
optical drop outs to define their red quasar samples).
In Figure 4 we visually examine the amount of dust reddening implied by our selection technique by plotting the
∆(g ∗ − i ∗ ) colour as a function of redshift for the bQSOs,
cQSOs and rQSOs. The dashed lines denote the effect of
SMC-type extinction (Prevot et al. 1984) as a function of
redshift with E(B − V) = 0.04, 0.12 and 0.2 (e.g., Richards
et al. 2003) on the emission of a typical quasar. Our selection
of red quasars is broadly consistent with E(B − V) > 0.04 at
z > 0.8 for a blue quasar SED. This corresponds to an equivalent hydrogen column density of NH > 2.8 × 1020 cm−2 assuming an SMC-like dust-to-gas (E(B − V)/NH ) ratio, comparable to that found towards the HII-regions in normal

galaxies (Buchner et al. 2017); we note that LaMassa et al.
(2016) and Glikman et al. (2017) find that radio-selected
red quasars have dust-to-gas ratios up-to an order of magnitude below the Galactic value, which would lead to higher
hydrogen column densities by up-to an order of magnitude.
The range in ∆(g ∗ − i ∗ ) colours suggest that the majority of
our rQSOs require AV ∼ 0.1 − 0.5 mag to produce the observed optical colours. By comparison, NIR based selection
techniques are sensitive to selecting red quasars with a dust
extinction of up to AV ∼ 1 − 6 mag (e.g. Glikman et al. 2004;
Banerji et al. 2012), hence the rQSOs in our study represent
less extreme dust-reddened red quasars.

2.3

Defining the AGN power at rest-frame 6 µm:
luminosity-redshift matched samples

To reliably infer any fundamental differences in the properties of the rQSOs from blue quasars (i.e., the bQSOs and
cQSOs) we must ensure that our results are not driven by
differences in the bolometric luminosities of the quasars.
Shen et al. (2011) provide bolometric luminosities (Lbol )
for the S10 quasar sample, however, they are inferred from
rest-frame UV-optical continuum measurements and have
not been corrected for dust extinction. Consequently, the
Lbol values are likely to be significantly underestimated in
the rQSOs, which will also lead to unreliable BH masses
and Eddington ratios. We therefore calculate the bolometric luminosities for our quasar subsamples using the MIR
WISE data, as described below, and utilise these to create
luminosity-redshift matched samples.

Fundamental differences between red and blue quasars

for the full colour-selected samples; the bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs are indicated using the colour scheme in Figure 2 for redshifts
in the range 0.2 < z < 2.4. It is evident that the colours of red
quasars are more broadly distributed in the colour-colour parameter space than more blue quasars, even in bands unrelated to our
red quasar selection approach. Furthermore, our g∗ − i ∗ colour selection appears to be broadly consistent with other optical colours
in selecting quasars, e.g., u ∗ − r ∗ . A minority of the cQSOs have
g∗ − i ∗ > 0.5 which is not a failure of our approach but a normal
consequence of our redshift-sensitive selection technique; see also
Figure 2 where this is evident for quasars at z < 0.3.

2.3.1

MIR measurements: a more robust approach

In order to accurately quantify the MIR emission from the
quasar, it is imperative to verify that it is not contaminated
by the host galaxy. Since the dusty AGN torus radiates predominantly at MIR wavelengths while star formation from
the host galaxy peaks at FIR wavelengths, we would expect
the MIR emission from our quasars to be dominated by the
AGN. To verify this, we make use of the diagnostic W ISE
three-band colour-colour diagram on which Mateos et al.
(2012) define a region (called the “AGN wedge”; Figure 5)
which identifies AGN with red MIR power-law SEDs with
a spectral index α ≤ −0.3. Host star-formation with a MIR
luminosity > 10% of that of the AGN would systematically
move QSOs out of the lower right of the wedge; however, this
requires high star formation rate (SFR) levels (e.g., > 100
M /yr at z > 1).
In Figure 5 we plot the WISE colours (W1 − W2 vs
W2 − W3) of our colour-selected quasars and indicate the
AGN wedge to show where AGN are expected to lie. The
bulk (∼95-99%) of the quasars lie within the wedge; however, a small fraction lie outside as reported in Table 2. Most
of the bQSO and cQSO outliers are higher redshift sources
(z > 1.5), while the majority of the rQSO outliers tend to
be at lower redshifts (z < 1.5); the same result is found
for the FIRST-detected samples. The colours of the sources
outside of the wedge at low redshifts can potentially be attributed to dominant host galaxy emission in low-luminosity

The dashed lines are the dust-reddening for E(B −V ) = 0.04, 0.12

0.3, and 0.5 mags for a typical quasar SED. The range in the
relative colours of the rQSOs suggests that the majority require
AV ∼ 0.1 − 0.5 mag to produce the observed optical colours.

lie outside of the AGN wedge we can confidently assert that
> 90% of the MIR light in most of our quasars come from
an AGN, and for these, we can reliably estimate their MIR
AGN luminosities (L6µm ; see §2.1.3 for the details of the
luminosity calculation).
In Figure 6 we plot the L6 µm as a function of redshift.
The median log(L6µm ) of the colour-selected (square) and
FIRST-detected (cross) quasars are also plotted in the respective z-bins. We find lower median log(L6µm ) values for
the rQSOs than the bQSOs at low redshifts (z < 0.8). This is
also mirrored in the higher fraction of rQSO outliers in the
AGN wedge at these redshifts and may be the consequence
of host-galaxy dilution affecting the colours of the lower luminosity quasars at lower redshifts. However, at higher red-

shifts (0.8 < z < 2.4) the opposite trend is seen where the
rQSOs peak at higher 6 µm luminosities in comparison to
the bQSOs and cQSOs (both in terms of higher median luminosities and larger maximum values). These effects could
be a consequence of the optical selection of SDSS quasars
which would mean that rQSOs that are obscured in the optical/UV by dust will only satisfy the SDSS quasar selection
if they are intrinsically more luminous.
If the rQSOs are more subject to dust extinction, then

we would expect the optical AGN emission to be relatively
weaker when compared to the L6µm than the bQSOs and cQSOs. In Figure 7 this is demonstrated by a comparison between the inferred bolometric luminosities from Shen et al.
(2011) (Lbol,Shen ) to those derived from the 6 µm luminosity:
Lbol,6µm = BC6µm × L6µm , where we adopted BC6µm = 8
from Stanley et al. (2015). The continuum luminosities at

provided in Shen et al. (2011) were used as the optical boloMNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

metric luminosity. The median luminosity ratios (vertical
dash-dot lines) computed from the 5100 Å luminosity are relatively consistent for the bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs. Contrariwise, as we approach shorter wavelengths, going from
3000 Å to 1350 Å luminosities, the median luminosity ratios
of the red quasars decrease with respect to that of the blue
quasars. This is the signature that we would expect for dust
reddening as the shorter wavelength emission will be more
suppressed for a fixed amount of obscuration than longer
wavelength emission. Conversely to the underestimated luminosities, a few red quasars have notable overestimated optical bolometric luminosities (lower tail) which may be due
to host contamination in lower luminosity quasars at low
redshifts. At z < 0.5 the ∆(g ∗ − i ∗ ) values of the blue and red
quasars are seen to deviate from the overall population (see
Figure 4); the blue quasars have bluer colours than the median quasar at the specific redshift, whereas the red quasars
have redder colours. A possible explanation for the change in
the apparent shape of the distribution is likely host galaxy
contamination at lower redshifts.

2.3.2

Defining the luminosity-redshift matched
colour-selected quasar samples

The different optical and MIR luminosity distributions between the bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs shown in §2.3.1 could
skew any differences in the intrinsic properties between red
and blue quasars. We have therefore adopted a luminosity
and redshift matching approach to refine our quasar samples
and exclude any biases in our results introduced by luminosity differences.
We luminosity matched the bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs
in rest-frame 6 µm luminosity and redshift using tolerances
of 0.2 dex and 0.05, respectively, with the following procedure (see Figure 1 and Table 1): (1) we used the the 2-d
Cartesian Anisotropic algorithm from the ‘Triple Match’
function in topcat (Taylor 2005, 2006) keeping the best
symmetric matches of the bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs in

quasars in each of the bQSO, cQSO, and rQSO sub samples,
of which 129, 113, and 323 are radio detected, respectively.

RESULTS

In this section we use our two defined samples (the full
colour-selected sample and the L6µm − z matched colourselected sample) to search for fundamental differences between the radio properties of red and blue quasars. We
explore the radio-detection rates in §3.1, the radio morphologies in §3.2, and the radio luminosities (L1.4GHz and
L1.4GHz /L6µm ) in §3.3.

FIRST detection rates of red versus blue
quasars

The FIRST radio-detection rate as a function of the median redshift in each of the four redshift bins for the colourselected samples is presented in Figure 8. We used the
Bayesian binomial confidence interval technique discussed in
Cameron (2011) to calculate 1σ uncertainties on the radiodetection fractions for both the full and L6µm − z matched
colour-selected samples. In Table 3 we show the source
statistics for the different samples.
The bQSOs and cQSOs have similar radio-detection
fractions of ≈ 5% – 10% across all redshifts. However, it is
apparent that rQSOs always exhibit a significantly higher
FIRST detection rate (≈ 15% – 20%) relative to non-red
quasars; i.e., the radio-detection fraction of red quasars is
a factor of ≈ 2 – 3 times larger than blue quasars. This
enhancement is also apparent if we compute the radiodetection fraction for non-red quasars in our sample; i.e., all
quasars in the g ∗ − i ∗ colour distribution excluding the reddest 10%. The FIRST detection rates for these quasars are
consistent with those of the bQSOs and cQSOs and, hence,
they represent the typical quasar population of which only
5–10% are radio bright. Our results are consistent between
the full and L6µm − z matched colour-selected samples.
In our colour sample definitions we have taken the top
10% to define rQSOs (see §2.2). In Figure 9 we show how the
radio-detection fraction changes from the bluest to reddest
quasars: the top 10% of the reddest SDSS quasars always
show the largest radio-detection fraction; however, we note
that a more refined colour-based selection of red quasars
could result in even more significant differences from blue
quasars.

Radio morphologies of red versus blue quasars

Given the differences in the radio-detection fractions of red
and blue quasars it is useful to determine whether there
are associated differences in the radio morphologies; i.e.,
whether red quasars favour a specific radio morphological
class above another. Radio-detected quasars often exhibit
large scale radio jets and lobes which extend to tens of kpc,
and in extreme cases can reach up to several Mpc (e.g.,
Muxlow & Garrington 1991). Their radio morphologies are

luminosity with a bolometric correction of BC = 8. The vertical dash-dot lines illustrate the median luminosity ratio for the respective
radio-detected quasar subsamples.

diverse but can be broadly characterised into two groups:
core and extended radio sources (e.g., Peterson 1997; Lu
et al. 2007). Core radio sources are spatially unresolved at
resolutions similar to FIRST and tend to have flat radio
spectra (α < 0.5). In contrast, quasars with extended radio
morphologies have radio spectra that are steep (α > 0.5) and
generally have the signature of two symmetric lobes (spatially resolved), although they can exhibit asymmetric lobes,
jet-tail structures and other extended features. Extended radio sources are further differentiated into two main classes
based on the surface brightness of the core to lobes, i.e.,
Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I and II (Fanaroff & Riley 1974),
where the former are core-dominated systems and the latter are lobe-dominated systems (e.g., Fanaroff & Riley 1974;
Bicknell 1995).
With the modest resolution of FIRST we can explore
radio morphologies for sources that extend beyond the 5 00
beam size of the survey (this corresponds to projected sizes
in the range 17–41 kpc at z = 0.2 − 2.4 for our assumed
cosmology). However, given the diverse range of radio morphologies of quasars, some will be too extended to be picked
up by FIRST. Given these challenges we developed a comprehensive strategy to identify potentially extended radio
sources, which we then visually classify using a simple approach that captures the morphological diversity of radiodetected quasars. Our approach to identify and classify potentially extended sources is illustrated in Figure 10 and is
described below.
The FIRST survey decomposes radio sources into multiple gaussian components and reports size measurements for
these components (White et al. 1997). Therefore the simplest approach in identifying extended sources is to search
for cases where the gaussian sizes are larger than the FIRST
beam size (5 00 ) or with multiple radio counterparts within
our cross-match radius of 10 00 .3 This approach will identify

3

Most of these FIRST-detected colour-selected quasars are associated with single radio counterparts within 1000 of the optical

the vast majority of extended sources but will miss the most
extended systems that lack bright radio cores; i.e., sources
with very large lobe structures that lie beyond our 10 00 crossmatch radius and remain undetected by FIRST due to a
faint radio core. To overcome this limitation we employed
the 1.4 GHz NVSS survey which overlaps with the FIRST
and SDSS footprint, but has a beam size of 45 00 , significantly
larger than FIRST. This allows for the inclusion of largescale radio structures beyond 10 00 . Using the methodology
given in Lu et al. (2007), we estimate that only ≈ 0.2% will
have spurious matches or unassociated sources for r = 10 00
(this increases to ≈ 4% for r = 45 00 ). We note that since NVSS
is 2.5 times less sensitive than FIRST, faint diffuse extended
sources will be missed in this analysis.
Figure 11 shows the NVSS versus FIRST fluxes for
the FbQSOs, FcQSOs and FrQSOs. The majority of the
sources follow a 1:1 trend. In this figure sources indicated
with crosses have NVSS fluxes that are at least twice their
FIRST fluxes: 12%, 10% and 7% of the FbQSOs, FcQSOs
and FrQSOs are highlighted. For these sources FIRST may
have underestimated their extended emission and they were
visually assessed (see Figure 10). While radio variability may
also explain these single component outliers (e.g., Heeschen
et al. 1987; Kraus et al. 2003; Barvainis et al. 2005; Czerny
et al. 2008), we nevertheless include them as potential extended sources.
All potentially extended sources highlighted by the process illustrated in Figure 10 were visually classified by three
people (LK, DMA, DJR) using cutout images at 1.4 GHz extracted from the VLA FIRST server. Overall we inspected
396 FIRST cutouts of 2 0 × 2 0 fields centred on the S10 QSO
positions. This field size is sufficient since all but 7 of our
radio-detected quasars have smaller angular sizes than 2 0
(see e.g., de Vries et al. 2006), which corresponds to pro-

position. Only 4% of the FrQSOs have multiple radio components,
whilst 8% of the FbQSOs and 10% of the FcQSOs have multiple
radio components.

jected sizes of < 0.4–1.0 Mpc at z = 0.2−2.4. In our visual assessment we employed a simplified classification scheme that
captures the main morphological classes of radio-detected
quasars and minimises redshift- and resolution-dependent
effects: (1) faint, (2) compact, (3) extended, (4) FR II-like
and (5) compact FR II; see Table 4 for a more detailed description. Of all the FIRST-detected quasars in our study,
27% required visual assessment according to our approach
with the remaining 73% of radio-detected quasars categorized either as compact (non-extended; single components
with fitted major axes less than 5 00 ) or faint (Fpeak < 3 mJy)
radio sources. Although the compact and faint radio sources
are not expected to be extended, for completeness we performed a visual check of their morphologies: we found 5% of
the faint and compact samples to have either extended or
FR II-like morphologies and we reclassified these systems.
Figure 12 summarizes the results of our morphological analysis by showing the percentages of the bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs in each of the morphology classes; see also
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

Table 5. We calculated the 1σ binomial uncertainties on
our percentages for both the full and L6µm − z matched
colour-selected samples following Cameron (2011). This figure shows that rQSOs have a different radio morphological
mix to blue quasars. There are no significant differences in
the fraction of rQSOs and blue quasars with extended radio morphologies, such as the classical FRII-type systems.
However, a factor 2–6 more rQSOs have either compact radio
emission or are radio faint, in comparison to blue quasars, a
result that is consistent between both the full and L6µm − z
matched colour-selected samples. It is these compact and
faint radio sources that are responsible for the increase in
the overall radio-detection fraction between rQSOs and blue
quasars in Figure 8.

Classification

Description

Faint

Sources detected close to the FIRST detection threshold with peak fluxes of Fpeak < 3 mJy.

Compact

Sources that are point-like with non-extended emission (fitted major axes < 500 ).

Extended

Single radio sources that are extended.
This class includes FR I-like systems where both lobes are fainter than the core; Flobe < Fpeak .

FR II-like

Double lobed systems with approximately the same brightness and offset from QSO position.
At least one lobe should be brighter than than QSO core (Flobe > Fpeak ).

Compact FR II

FR II-like systems on small scales, i.e within the 1000 radius circle (which corresponds to a
projected size of ∼ 85 kpc at z = 1.5).

FrQSOs have low radio luminosities. In addition to the radio morphologies we therefore also explored the radio luminosities (L1.4GHz ) and “radio-loudness” (here defined as
L1.4GHz /L6µm ) of the FIRST-detected quasars. For consistency, in these analyses we used the total FIRST fluxes of
all radio-detected components within 10 00 to calculate the
1.4 GHz luminosities, even if their NVSS fluxes differed from
FIRST (see §2.1.2).
In Figure 13 we plot L1.4GHz vs. redshift for the FbQSOs, FcQSOs and FrQSOs. The radio luminosity distribu-

tions of all three samples changes with redshift due to the
flux limit of the FIRST survey. Beyond z > 0.5, L1.4GHz is
higher than that of the strongest star-forming galaxies, indicating that the radio emission must be dominated by the
AGN in almost all cases (e.g., Arp 220 is the most powerful nearby starburst with log(L1.4GHz /W Hz−1 ) = 23.4; Condon et al. 2013). Noticeably, as indicated by our morphology
analysis, there is a strong concentration of FrQSOs close to
the FIRST detection limit.
An alternative way to investigate the radio power is to

explore the relative ratio of the quasar in the radio band to
the overall accretion power. This is effectively a measure of
the “radio loudness”, which we define here as R. Many studies use the 5 GHz-to-2500 Å flux ratio to define radio-loud
quasars as objects with R > 10 (e.g., Kellermann et al. 1989;
Stocke et al. 1992; Urry & Padovani 1995; Ivezić et al. 2002;
Glikman et al. 2004; Zakamska & Greene 2014; Mehdipour
& Costantini 2019). The transition between the radio-quiet
and radio-loud regime is not definite and often quasars with
3 < R < 100 are considered to be radio-intermediate. Using
the R-values provided in Shen et al. (2011) and the standard
definition of radio loudness, we find that 81%, 78% and 83%
of the FbQSOs, FcQSOs and FrQSOs are radio-loud quasars
with R > 10.
To reliably constrain the radio loudness in our analyses here we use the rest-frame 1.4 GHz – 6 µm luminosity
ratio (L1.4GHz /L6µm ), which will be less affected by dust
extinction and redshift effects. In Figure 14 we plot the
relative fraction of FrQSOs and FbQSOs compared to FcQSOs as a function of R for both the full (filled markers) and L6µm –z matched (shaded regions) colour-selected
samples. We estimate the transition between radio-quiet
and radio-loud quasars by requiring that 90% of the Shen
et al. (2011) identified radio-loud FcQSOs satisfies our radio
loudness definition: log10 (L1.4GHz /L6µm ) ≈ −4.2 (dot-dashed
line); we used the FcQSOs since they will have typical optical quasar colours unaffected by dust reddening. This figure shows a factor ≈ 3–4 enhancement in the fraction of
FrQSOs with respect to both FbQSOs and FcQSOs towards lower values of R, indicating that the enhanced radiodetection fraction for the FrQSOs is from systems around the
radio-loud–radio-quiet threshold; we quantified this threshold (log10 (L1.4GHz /L6µm ) ≈ −4.2) in terms of the mechanicalto-radiative power to be Pmech,sync /Prad,L6µm ≈ 0.001.4 As
may be expected, given our earlier radio-morphology results,
the enhancement in the fraction of rQSOs at low R values
comes from systems with either faint or compact radio morphologies; the number of sources in each bin are indicated
in Figure 14 and tabulated in Table 6. No significant differences are found between red and blue quasars within the
classical extended radio-loud systems.

DISCUSSION

We have analysed the SDSS DR7 Quasar Catalogue from
S10 to look for fundamental differences in the radio properties between red and blue quasars. By carefully selecting
rQSOs, cQSOs and bQSOs from the top, middle and bottom 10% of the observed g ∗ − i ∗ colour distributions we have
generated uniformly selected samples unbiased in their radio
properties. Overall, we have found that rQSOs have a FIRST
radio-detection fraction of ≈ 15 − 20%, which is a factor of
4

On the basis of the methodology given in Willott et al. (1999),
we calculate the mechanical power from the jet and find that for
our assumed radio quiet-radio loud threshold the mechanical-toradiative power (Pmech,sync /Prad,L6µm ) corresponds to ∼ 0.1%. In
this calculation we assume a normalization factor zW = 5 (see
Daly et al. 2012); the normalization factor ranges between 1 – 20,
and combines several factors such as the lobe filling factor and
the amount of energy from non-radiating particles.

≈ 2 − 3 times larger than that of blue quasars (cQSOs and
bQSOs). Through a visual inspection of the FIRST images
and an assessment of the radio luminosities (L1.4 GHz and
L1.4 GHz /L6µm ) we find that the radio-detection excess for
rQSOs is primarily due to compact and radio-faint quasars
(those around the radio quiet-radio loud threshold). No significant differences are found between rQSOs, cQSOs, and
bQSOs within the classical extended radio-loud systems. We
find consistent results between our full and L6µm –z matched
colour-selected samples. Given that the radio luminosities of
the quasars are at least an order of magnitude above those
expected from star-formation (e.g., L1.4GHz > 1025 W Hz−1
at z > 1.5), the differences in the radio properties will be
driven by AGN-related processes (e.g., radio core, jets, lobes,
winds).

Many previous studies have explored the optical
properties of radio-detected quasars, finding that they
tend to have redder optical colours than radio-undetected
quasars (e.g., Ivezić et al. 2002; White et al. 2003). While
other studies have explored the radio morphologies of
radio-detected quasars and found that the quasars with unresolved radio emission tend to have redder optical colours
than the quasars with extended radio emission (e.g., Lu
et al. 2007; Kimball et al. 2011). However, fewer studies have
explored the radio properties of carefully selected red and
blue quasars. Tsai & Hwang (2017) distinguished between
red and blue quasars based on their spectral colours (flux
ratio of the rest frame 4000Å to 3000Å continuum emission)
and, similarly to our work, found a larger number of red
quasars to be detected with FIRST; however, their analysis
was restricted to low redshifts (0.3 < z < 1.2). Similarly,
Richards et al. (2003) reported that dust-reddened SDSS
quasars have average FIRST detection-fractions ≈ 2 × larger
than intrinsically blue quasars while White et al. (2007)
stacked the FIRST data of SDSS quasars as a function
of g ∗ − r ∗ colour and found an increase in the radio-flux
density towards redder optical colours. We also note that
Georgakakis et al. (2009) tentatively found that a higher
fraction of 2MASS NIR selected quasars are associated with
radio emission than optically selected SDSS quasars.
However, our study is the first to systematically explore
the optical colour dependence on the radio-detection fraction
as a function of radio morphology, luminosity, and “radioloudness”. A strength of our approach is that we have carefully selected comparison samples (rQSO, cQSO, and bQSO)
from the same quasar population, allowing us to rule out significant selection and luminosity effects in our analyses.
Overall, given the connection between the rQSOs and
radio emission it is natural to ask whether they are produced by the same physical process. The only process likely
to contribute to both the optical and radio wavebands is
synchrotron radiation, which is the dominant physical mechanism in the radio waveband. Qualitatively, it appears unMNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

the sensitivity limit (Fpeak < 3 mJy), bright compact radio sources, bright extended radio sources, FR II-like systems and compact FR IIs
(small scale lobe-systems); see Table 4 for more details. The errorbars correspond to the 1σ binomial uncertainties and the vertical dash
lines separate the different categories. Example 20 × 20 FIRST images of each morphological class are illustrated in the top panel. The
white circle represents our cross-matching radius of 1000 . Extended radio emission is found among a similar fraction of all quasars, but
red quasars show a surfeit of compact and faint systems.

likely that synchrotron radiation can explain the enhanced
radio emission in rQSOs since the significant difference between rQSOs and blue quasars occurs in comparatively
radio-weak systems. Indeed, from a more quantitative analysis, where we scale a synchrotron-dominated SED to the
radio flux, we predict that only ≈ 6% of the FbQSOs and
FcQSOs and ≈ 8% of FrQSOs are likely to suffer from significant contamination of the optical emission from synchrotron
processes; see appendix A for more details. Our results are
qualitatively similar to those of Glikman et al. (2007) who
undertook a similar analysis but for a brighter NIR selected
red-quasar sample. We therefore conclude that dust extinction is the most plausible explanation for the optical colours
of the majority of red quasars, in agreement with previous
works (e.g., Webster et al. 1995; Gregg et al. 2002; Richards
et al. 2003; Glikman et al. 2004, 2007, 2012; Kim & Im 2018),
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

particularly at z > 0.5 where dilution from the host galaxy
is likely to be weak (see §2.3.1).
On the basis of our results how can we explain the connection between the red colours and different radio properties of the rQSOs when compared to blue quasars? Below we
discuss our results within the context of the two competing
models for red quasars, the orientation model (§4.1) and the
evolutionary model (§4.2).

4.1

Evidence against a simple
orientation-dependent model

In a simple orientation-dependent model we would not expect physical differences between red and blue quasars; in
this model any observed differences would merely be a consequence of more dust along the line-of-sight. Since radio

The FIRST fluxes of quasars with multiple radio counterparts within 1000 have been added to compute the total luminosity. The median
log(L1.4GHz ) in each of the 4 redshift bins are indicated with crosses. The dash-dot lines indicate radio luminosities corresponding to star
formation rates (SFRs) of 100 and 1000 M yr−1 (see Hopkins et al. 2001, for details on the SFR calculations).

emission is not affected by dust, we would therefore expect
no significant differences in the radio-detection fraction between different quasar sub populations, in stark contrast to
our result (factor ≈ 3 times more radio-detected rQSOs when
compared to bQSOs and cQSOs, even when controlling for
luminosity and redshift effects). In fact, since blue quasars
would be more face on than the red quasars, on the basis of
the orientation model, we would actually expect the opposite result (i.e., a relatively larger fraction of radio-detected
bQSOs and cQSOs than rQSOs).
The differences in the radio morphologies and the radio luminosities of the rQSOs and blue quasars also argue
against the orientation model. In the orientation model the
rQSOs are more inclined than blue quasars and so the radio emission would be more extended (on average) while
we find an excess of compact radio morphologies for the
rQSOs, again the opposite to what we would expect. The
larger fraction of rQSOs with low radio luminosities (i.e., either L1.4 GHz or L1.4 GHz /L6µm ) is also inconsistent with the
orientation model which would predict no significant differences in the radio luminosities of the different quasar sub
populations.

4.2

Empirical constraints for an evolutionary
model

Since our radio results cannot be explained (solely) by orientation, they must imply fundamental differences between
red and blue quasars. These differences could be driven by
changes in the physical properties of the quasars themselves
(e.g., the BH accretion disc) or they could be related to the
larger-scale “environment”; we use the term “environment”
here to describe a broad range of potential physical phenomena over a wide range of size scales (e.g., pc–Mpc scales). We
briefly discuss the empirical constraints that our study can
place on these scenarios below.
Several studies have found that a small number of Xray, optical, and NIR selected quasars are characterized by

intrinsically red continua, potentially related to different accretion rates in the red quasars compared to blue quasars
(Puchnarewicz & Mason 1998; Richards et al. 2003; Young
et al. 2008; Ruiz et al. 2014; Kim & Im 2018). Since it has
also been noted that radio emission is enhanced in low Eddington rate AGN (e.g. Heckman et al. 2004; Kauffmann
et al. 2008), it is therefore reasonable to consider whether the
rQSOs have lower accretion rates in comparison to bQSOs
and cQSOs due to their enhanced radio-detection fractions.
We test this here by estimating the range in Eddington ratios between the L6µm − z matched colour samples using the
bolometric luminosities (estimated from L6µm ; see §2.3.1)
and the FWHM of the broad lines as a proxy of the BH
masses (i.e., based on virial BH masses).
In Figure 15 we show the estimated bolometric luminosL
ity (Lbol,6µm ) as a function of FWHM for the b,c,rQSOz 6µm
quasars. The median values for the different broad lines (different z-bins) are overlaid and we calculated the median
absolute deviation (MAD) as the uncertainty on the median. Eddington ratio tracks ranging from 0.01 < λEdd < 1
are also plotted, calibrated against values from Shen et al.
(2011) for the cQSOs. A large scatter in the FWHMs is
observed, especially for the rQSOs which often have larger
associated uncertainties due to lower SNR spectra. Nevertheless, from the median values it is clear that there are
no statistically significant differences in the FWHM values
L
between the b,c,rQSOz 6µm quasars. These results would appear to be in disagreement with Richards et al. (2003) who
found a trend of narrower Balmer lines towards redder optical colours; however, we note that this result is based on
composite quasar spectra with higher SNR allowing them
to see more subtle trends than in our analysis. Using the
bolometric and BH mass relation for the Eddington ratio,
we estimated the median Eddington ratio for each bin of
the bQSOs, cQSOs, and rQSOs: all are broadly consistent
with an increase from low-to-high redshift of λEdd ≈ 0.1 –
0.5. Since the quasars are matched in luminosity we therefore argue that there are no strong differences in the average

transition between radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars, quantified in terms of the mechanical-to-radiative power (see footnote 4 and §3.3).
The number of sources in each R-bin is subdivided into faint and compact morphologies (F+C) and extended (E; including extended,
FR IIs and compact FR IIs) morphologies. The enhanced radio-detection fraction for the rQSOs is predominantly from systems around

accretion rates between red and blue quasars. This result
appears to be in disagreement with some previous studies
which have found that radio-selected red quasars have higher
accretion rates than blue quasars (e.g., Urrutia et al. 2012;
Kim et al. 2015), on the basis of optical–NIR spectra of small
quasar samples. However, our current analysis is limited by
the large uncertainties in individual FWHM measurements
from Shen et al. (2011). We aim to clarify the connection
between red quasars and accretion properties in upcoming
work using a matched sample of rQSOs and cQSOs with
high-quality VLT-XSHOOTER optical–NIR spectroscopy.
While our analyses of the accretion properties do not
show significant differences between the red and blue quasars
on average, the enhancement in the fraction of rQSOs with
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

compact or faint radio emission suggest fundamental differences between these sub populations. The radio compactness
indicates that the source of the differences in the radio properties emerges on nuclear or galaxy scales (< 40 kpc). Within
the context of the evolutionary model, this could imply that
the red quasars are in a younger transitional phase with
small, but expanding, radio jets (such as Compact Steep
Spectrum (CSS) and gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS); see
also e.g., O’Dea & Baum 1997; Murgia et al. 1999; Rossetti
et al. 2006; Randall et al. 2011; Dallacasa et al. 2013; Orienti 2016); indeed, Georgakakis et al. (2012) has argued a
similar interpretation for a small sample of FIRST-detected
dust-reddened quasars. In this model red quasars represent
an early obscured phase during which energetic winds drive

away the obscuring dust and gas revealing an unobscured
view of the accretion disc (i.e., a blue quasar). As the dust
cocoon expands it confines a young radio source which remains compact on galaxy scales. Strong shocks associated
with these interactions could sustain their radio synchrotron
emission (e.g., Hwang et al. 2018), leading to the enhanced
radio-detection fractions which we observe.
A prediction of the evolutionary model is that red
quasars will host more powerful winds than blue quasars. Interestingly, Mehdipour & Costantini (2019) recently showed
an anti-correlation between the column density of ionised
winds in quasars and the “radio-loudness”, whereby the systems with the weaker radio emission have stronger winds.
The enhancement in the fraction of rQSOs with low R =
L1.4 GHz /L6µm values therefore indirectly suggests that they
will host stronger winds than bQSOs. On the basis of the
current data, we are unable to test whether the rQSOs have
stronger winds than the bQSOs. However, we can use the
sub population of broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs;
Foltz et al. 1987; Weymann et al. 1991), which are known
to host powerful winds, to see whether they are preferentially radio weak and to therefore provide an indirect test
of this relationship. In Figure 14 we plot the relative fraction of FIRST-detected BALQSOs compared to FcQSOs as
a function of R; we identified BALQSOs as systems with
C iv (1.5 < z < 2.4) broad absorption lines from our parent
sample (see Figure 1) using the data provided in Shen et al.
(2011) (bal flag = 1 or bal flag = 3). We find an enhancement of BALQSOs at low values of R and a deficiency
at high values of R, results which are in general agreement
with those obtained by Morabito et al. (2019) for deeper
low-frequency LOFAR radio data. The behaviour at high
values of R is strikingly similar to that found for the rQSOs, suggesting that rQSOs may also host powerful winds,
in good agreement with the evolutionary model; see also Urrutia et al. (2009) for evidence of an enhancement of BALQSOs in the red-quasar population. We will more directly test
this hypothesis in a future VLT-XSHOOTER spectroscopic

study and also determine whether the red quasars from our
sample host more powerful winds than the blue quasars.

CONCLUSIONS

We have taken a novel approach to search for fundamental
differences between red and blue quasars at 0.2 < z < 2.4 to
allow us to test between the two main competing models: the
unified orientation model and an evolutionary model. Our
quasar selection is based on the SDSS survey and is uniformly selected and unbiased in the radio. We distinguished
between red (rQSOs), control (cQSOs) and blue (bQSOs)
quasars using carefully constructed g ∗ − i ∗ colour distributions as a function of redshift. Our rQSO selection is therefore sensitive to the redshift evolution of quasar SEDs. We
found that the red colours of the rQSOs suggest that the
majority require AV ∼ 0.1 − 0.5 mag of dust reddening to the
median cQSO to produce the observed optical colours.
From a systematic comparison of the radio properties
of the rQSOs, cQSOs and bQSOs, we have identified fundamental differences that cannot be attributed to just the
orientation model. Our results are consistent between our
full and L6µm − z matched colour-selected samples:
• Enhanced radio emission from the AGN in rQSOs (see Figure 8): a larger fraction of rQSOs (by a factor
of 2–3) are detected in the 1.4 GHz FIRST survey when compared to cQSOs and bQSOs. The average FIRST detection
rate across 0.2 < z < 2.4 are 5%–10% for the cQSOs and
bQSOs and 15%–20% for the rQSOs. The radio luminosities are at least an order of magnitude above those expected
from SF (e.g., L1.4GHz > 1025 W Hz−1 at z > 1.5), indicating
that they are driven by AGN-related processes. See §3.1.
• rQSOs have differences in their arcsecond-scale
radio morphologies (see Figure 12): from a visual assessment of the FIRST cutouts we have found that the incidence of systems with extended and FR II-like radio morMNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

Fundamental differences between red and blue quasars
phologies among the rQSOs is the same as among the cQSOs/bQSOs, but they have a much higher incidence of faint
and compact radio counterparts (by a factor of 2–6). The
radio-detection enhancement of the rQSOs therefore occurs
in the compact and faint radio sources rather than the classical extended radio-loud systems. See §3.2.
• rQSOs have lower radio–MIR luminosity ratios
(L1.4 GHz /L6µm ; see Figure 14): we found a factor ≈ 3–4
enhancement of rQSOs at low L1.4 GHz /L6µm values, around
the radio quiet-radio loud threshold, when compared to cQSOs and bQSOs. These differences are dominated by the
compact and faint radio sources that are responsible for the
enhanced radio-detection fraction of rQSOs. We see no significant differences in the classical extended radio-loud systems. See §3.3.
By linking the enhanced radio-detection rates and dust
extinction of rQSOs we conclude that these sources are not
blue quasars with additional dust along the line-of-sight due
to a larger viewing angle as a simple orientation model would
predict. By comparison we argue that the radio properties
of the rQSOs are consistent with the evolutionary paradigm
where rQSOs contain younger, more compact radio sources,
possibly in a brief transitional phase where powerful winds
are driving away the obscuring gas and dust.
In future work we will investigate radio spectral indices
with multi-frequency radio data, which provide a more comprehensive understanding of the radio properties of the rQSOs. We will also further explore the origin of redness in
the rQSOs from optical–NIR spectral analysis, constrain the
star-formation rates from the host galaxy using Herschel–
ALMA far-IR and mm imaging, and search for mergerdriven signatures from high spatial resolution optical–NIR
imaging.

APPENDIX A: CONTRIBUTION OF
SYNCHROTRON RADIATION TO THE
OPTICAL EMISSION
Here we estimate the contamination of the optical emission
from synchrotron radiation for the radio-detected quasars
to assess whether this can explain the enhancement in
the radio-detection of rQSOs. The SEDs of compact radio sources such as FSRQs (which forms part of the blazar
AGN subclass) are well known for their “double-humped”
shape with a low-energy component extending from radio to
UV/X-rays, and a high-energy component that extends from
X-rays to GeV/TeV γ-rays. The synchrotron nature of the
low-energy component is well established: FSRQs, for example, are well known for their low-synchrotron peaked SEDs
with the peak frequency in the infrared regime (< 1014 Hz
or wavelengths > 3µm). Therefore, to investigate whether a
red synchrotron component can explain the reddening of the
rQSOs, we employed a model in which all the radio−optical
power can be attributed to synchrotron emission, as in the
case of FSRQs. If the rQSOs are reddened by dominant synchrotron emission beamed along our line-of-sight, we would
expect the optical synchrotron fluxes to be in agreement
with the observed optical fluxes.
The approach we have followed is to fit a synchrotron
emission model (e.g., Finke et al. 2008; Dermer et al. 2009)
to the radio−optical data of 3FGL J0045.2-3704 (see Klindt
et al. 2017) to generate a prototypical template. We adopted
the SED of 3FGL J0045.2-3704 because it has a blue quasar
spectrum in the optical band, but also has a flat MIRoptical SED that is consistent with the observed properties of our quasars. We subsequently scaled this template to
the 1.4 GHz flux of our radio-detected quasars to estimate
their expected i-band flux from a synchrotron component.
The ratios between the i-band fluxes estimated using the
FSRQ synchrotron template (Fi,synch ) and the observed iband SDSS fluxes (Fi,SDSS ) are shown in Figure A1 for the
FIRST-detected bQSOs, cQSOs and rQSOs (FbQSOs, FcQSOs and FrQSOs, respectively).
For the majority of the quasars in all three samples
a synchrotron model underpredicts the i-band fluxes by at
least an order of magnitude. Only 6% of FbQSOs and FcQSOs and 8% of FrQSOs have Fi,synch greater than Fi,SDSS .
This suggests that the optical bands are not contaminated
by synchrotron emission from the radio jet for the majority
of the radio-detected quasars in our sample and, hence, this
cannot be the primary source of reddening of the rQSOs.
Indeed, as can be seen in Figure A1, the majority of the rQSOs will have an extremely small synchrotron contribution
to the optical emission, which is a direct consequence of the
pre-ponderance of low radio luminosities from the rQSOs.
Consequently, the majority of rQSOs are expected to have a

Figure A1. The ratio between the estimated synchrotron iband flux and the observed SDSS i-band flux for the FbQSOs,
FcQSOs and FrQSOs. The synchrotron i-band fluxes were estimated from the 1.4 GHz flux using a synchrotron model of an
FSRQ, 3FGL J0045.2-3704. The dashed lines indicate the median
for each distribution, and the grey shaded area indicates where
Fi,synch > Fi,synch . Based on this it is evident that synchrotron
emission is not the main source of reddening of the rQSOs.

lower synchrotron contribution in the optical band than the
bQSOs and cQSOs.
