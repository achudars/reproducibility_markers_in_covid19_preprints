ABSTRACT

The dissipation of turbulent magnetic fields is an appealing scenario to explain the origin
of non-thermal particles in high-energy astrophysical sources. However, it has been suggested
that the particle distribution may effectively thermalise when the radiative (synchrotron and/or
Inverse Compton) losses are severe. Inspired by recent PIC simulations of relativistic turbulence, which show that electrons are impulsively heated in intermittent current sheets by a
strong electric field aligned with the local magnetic field, we instead argue that in plasmas
where the particle number density is dominated by the pairs (electron-positron and electronpositron-ion plasmas): (i) as an effect of fast cooling and of different injection times, the
electron energy distribution is dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 for γ . γheat (the Lorentz factor γheat being close
to the equipartition value), while the distribution steepens at higher energies; (ii) since the time
scales for the turbulent fields to decay and for the photons to escape are of the same order, the
magnetic and the radiation energy densities in the dissipation region are comparable; (iii) if
the mass energy of the plasma is dominated by the ion component, the pairs with a Lorentz
factor smaller than a critical one (of the order of the proton-to-electron mass ratio) become
isotropic, while the pitch angle remains small otherwise. The outlined scenario is consistent
with the typical conditions required to reproduce the Spectral Energy Distribution of blazars,
and allows one to estimate the magnetisation of the emission site. Finally, we show that turbulence within the Crab Nebula may power the observed gamma-ray flares if the pulsar wind
is nearly charge-separated at high latitudes.

INTRODUCTION

In the most extreme astrophysical environments (e.g. in the vicinity of black holes and pulsars), plasmas are expected to be in a
regime where the electromagnetic energy largely exceeds the particles mass energy. Though it has long been clear from observations that these plasmas must emit non-thermal radiation copiously,
the physical mechanism responsible for the dissipation of the electromagnetic energy and the consequent heating/acceleration of the
non-thermal particles is far less understood.
Since shocks are inefficient in highly magnetised flows
(e.g. Kennel & Coroniti 1984), turbulence is a natural candidate to dissipate the electromagnetic energy and consequently
to heat/accelerate the particles. Turbulence in relativistic magnetised plasmas has long been studied from a fluid perspective (e.g.
Thompson & Blaes 1998; Cho 2005; Zrake & MacFadyen 2012,
2013; Zrake 2014; Cho & Lazarian 2014; Zrake & East 2016;

Takamoto & Lazarian 2016, 2017). However, investigating the
kinetic aspects of the problem has been hampered by the enormous required computational effort, and the actual mechanism that
heats/accelerates the particles has therefore remained obscure.
Only recently, Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations are beginning to investigate the acceleration of particles in relativistic magnetised turbulence. Comisso & Sironi (2018, 2019) studied the case
of spontaneously decaying turbulence (namely, without any external driver continuously injecting energy into the system) in pair
plasmas. In our opinion, some of the most remarkable results of
these studies are:
(i) Most of the electrons from the thermal background are impulsively heated up to a Lorentz factor γheat ∼ B2 /8πne me c2 by a
strong electric field aligned with the local magnetic field in intermittently formed, large-scale current sheets.
(ii) Electrons are subsequently accelerated into a non-thermal
distribution extending up to γ  γheat by the stochastic interactions with the turbulent fluctuations. The electron energy spectrum
observed in the simulations depends on the detailed properties of

2

Sobacchi & Lyubarsky

the plasma (e.g. magnetisation and amplitude of the magnetic field
fluctuations compared to the background).
(iii) The typical pitch angle increases with the electron energy. The electrons with γ ∼ γheat (primarily heated by the parallel electric field) have a small pitch angle, while the electrons with
γ  γheat (primarily accelerated by the turbulent scattering) have a
larger pitch angle.
Zhdankin et al. (2017, 2018a,b) and Wong et al. (2019) studied the
case of externally driven turbulence (namely, with a continuous energy injection into the system). They found the acceleration phase
(item ii) to be similar to the studies of Comisso & Sironi (2018,
2019), while they did not find any clear evidence of an injection
phase (item i). It is possible that the impact of the parallel electric
field during the injection phase increases with the initial magnetisation of the plasma, which was indeed systematically higher in the
studies of Comisso & Sironi (2018, 2019) with respect to the studies of Zhdankin et al. (2017, 2018a,b) (for a more extended discussion on the dependence of the work done by the parallel electric
field on the magnetisation, see also Section 4.8 of Zhdankin et al.
2019). Being interested in the case of strongly magnetised plasmas,
one should therefore consider the impulsive electron heating during
injection phase as discussed by Comisso & Sironi (2018, 2019).
The studies of Comisso & Sironi (2018, 2019) and Zhdankin
et al. (2017, 2018a,b) have drawn attention to the role of turbulence
in the heating/acceleration of non-thermal particles. However, it is
not clear whether a population of non-thermal particles may survive
in the common case when the radiative losses are severe. The effect of a fast (synchrotron and Inverse Compton) cooling has been
included in an analytical model of turbulent plasmas by Uzdensky (2018). Assuming that the turbulent heating rate of individual
electrons remains approximately constant over the entire dynamical time, and therefore neglecting the role of the impulsive electron
heating during the injection phase, a steady state is reached where
heating and cooling balance for any individual electron. As a consequence of this, a quasi-thermal electron energy distribution forms
√
at a Lorentz factor γ ∼ 1/ τT , where τT  1 is the Thompson’s
optical depth of the system. Including the effect of Inverse Compton cooling in their PIC simulation of driven turbulence, Zhdankin
et al. (2019) have recently confirmed that a quasi-thermal electron
distribution may be produced. However, observations of relativistic astrophysical plasmas usually show power-law photon spectra,
indicating that the electron distribution has a similar scaling.
Here we show that the impulsive electron heating in intermittent, large-scale current sheets may be a key element to produce a
non-thermal electron population even when the radiative losses are
severe. Motivated by the results of the PIC simulations of Comisso
& Sironi (2018, 2019), we discuss the scenario where most of the
pairs are impulsively heated up to equipartition (γ ∼ γheat ) while entering a current sheet, after which they cool down for the rest of the
dynamical time. As an effect of cooling and of different injection
times, the electron energy distribution at γ . γheat is a power-law
of the form dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 , which is consistent with blazar observations. Since most of the work during the injection phase is done
by a parallel electric field, the momentum distribution is (at least
initially) strongly elongated in the direction of the magnetic field.
This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we discuss
the injection phase. In Section 3, we show how radiative cooling
shapes the electron energy distribution. In Section 4, we discuss
the astrophysical applications of the outlined scenario, focusing on
the modelling of the non-thermal emission from galactic jets and

of the gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula. Finally, in Section
5 we summarise our conclusions.

ELECTRON HEATING IN TURBULENT PLASMAS

We consider a plasma where the particle number density is dominated by the pairs (electron-positron or electron-positron-ion
plasma), characterised by a pair number density ne ≡ ne− + ne+
and a proton number density n p ≡ ne− − ne+  ne . As explained
in more detail in Section 4, astrophysical plasmas are expected to
be significantly loaded by pairs in different environments, including
galactic jets and Pulsar Wind Nebulae. We assume that the plasma
is threaded by a magnetic field B. We are interested in the case
when the turbulence is strong, in the sense that the amplitude of
the turbulent fluctuations is δB ∼ B. It is well known that the turbulent component of the magnetic field is dissipated on a typical time
scale tdyn ∼ L/vA , where L is the scale of the largest turbulent eddy
and vA is the Alfvén velocity (e.g. Biskamp 2003). In the following
we assume that L is comparable to the size of the system, and that
vA ∼ c as appropriate in the relativistic limit.
We assume the kinetic energy of the particles prior to dissipation to be at most mildly relativistic (γin βin . 1). We consider the
case when the initial magnetisation of the pairs,
B2
,
(1)
8πne me c2
is much larger than unity (σ0e  1). If the ions are present, the
initial magnetisation of the plasma is
σ0e ∼

Note that σ0 may be significantly smaller than σ0e if the ions dominate the mass density of the system, namely n p m p & ne me . In this
case, we assume that σ0 & 1, always keeping σ0e  1.
2.1

Lorentz factor of the heated electrons

After the turbulent component of the magnetic field has been dissipated, electrons and positrons are heated up to a typical Lorentz
factor γheat  γin , which can be estimated from the principle of
energy conservation. The energy density of the heated pairs, Ue ∼
γheat ne me c2 , is equal to a fraction εe < 1 of the available magnetic
energy density, UB ∼ B2 /8π (the remaining fraction ε p = 1 − εe
heats the protons). This gives
B2
∼ εe σ0e .
(3)
8πne me c2
In the case of a pair plasma, one has γheat ∼ σ0e since there are no
protons and therefore εe = 1. In the following we argue that the
efficiency εe is of order unity, and therefore γheat ∼ σ0e , also in
electron-positron-ion plasmas.
As discussed in the Introduction, recent PIC simulations suggest that electrons are heated from their initial γin up to γheat in the
course of one single event, while passing through a large-scale current sheet where the anti-parallel component δB ∼ B of the magnetic field reconnects (Comisso & Sironi 2018, 2019). Recently,
Petropoulou et al. (2019) have studied reconnection in electronpositron-ion plasmas, showing that the post-reconnection energy is
shared roughly equally between magnetic fields, pairs, and protons
(more specifically, they found that εe ∼ 1/3 if σ0e & 3). Hence, we
expect the efficiency εe to be of order unity in the regime σ0e  1
that we are interested in.

In the model of Uzdensky (2018) the heating is instead slow, in
the sense that the heating rate per electron remains approximately
constant over the entire dynamical time. Hence, from Eq. (4) one
finds that Pheat ∼ γheat me c2 /tdyn .

COOLING AND ELECTRON ENERGY DISTRIBUTION
Radiative cooling prescription

Besides being heated due to the turbulent energy dissipation, electrons cool down due to synchrotron and Inverse Compton emission.
We parametrise the radiated power per electron as
Pcool ∼

γ2 me c2
,
γcool tdyn

(7)

where γcool is defined as the Lorentz factor of the electrons that
cool approximately within a dynamical time. The parametrisation
of Eq. (7) is motivated by the well-known scaling Pcool ∝ γ2 (e.g.
Rybicki & Lightman 1979), and by the fact that the cooling time,
tcool ∼ γme c2 /Pcool ∼ tdyn γcool /γ, is indeed equal to the dynamical
time, tdyn , when γ ∼ γcool .

As discussed in the Introduction (for more details, see also Appendix A), pairs are heated by an electric field Ek aligned with
the local magnetic field, arising as the plasma becomes starved
of free charges in intermittently formed current sheets. If the velocity of the plasma flowing into the reconnection layer is at least
mildly relativistic, one expects the electric field to be of the same
order of magnitude of the magnetic field, namely Ek ∼ B (in their
PIC simulations, Comisso & Sironi (2018, 2019) found a typical
Ek ∼ 0.1 × B). Pairs are therefore heated on a time scale

Since the turbulent component of the magnetic field is dissipated
over a dynamical time, tdyn ∼ L/c, the heating rate per electron,

Lorentz factors of the distribution. The Lorentz factor γheat has the same
order of magnitude of the initial magnetisation of the electrons, namely
γheat ∼ σ0e ∼ B2 /8πne me c2  1; γcool is the Lorentz factor of the electrons
radiating most of their energy within one dynamical time; γmax is the maximum electron Lorentz factor allowed by the size of the system. In the fast
cooling regime (γcool . γheat ) the power-law index below the break is p1 = 2.

3.2.1

Ultra fast cooling regime (γcool . γ2heat /γmax )

In this regime the radiative losses in the reconnection layer are important. Indeed, cooling and heating in the reconnection layer bal√
ance each other when γ ∼ γcool γmax (this is obtained from the
√
condition Pheat ∼ Pcool using Eqs. 6 and 7). If γheat & γcool γmax ,
which is equivalent to γcool . γ2heat /γmax , the bulk of the electrons
√
can only be heated up to γb ∼ γcool γmax .
Electrons start cooling down after leaving the reconnection
layer, and their Lorentz factor reaches γmin ∼ γcool within a dynamical time. Due to the difference in the injection times, a nonthermal energy spectrum dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 is produced over the range
of Lorentz factors γmin . γ . γb . The spectrum produced by radiative cooling is a power-law of the form dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 because the
number of electrons per unit energy, γ × dne /dγ, is proportional to
the cooling time at that energy, tcool ∝ γ−1 .
Since the electric field inside the reconnection layer cannot
heat the electrons beyond γ ∼ γb , one generically expects the spectrum to steepen at γ & γb . The shape of the spectrum at γ & γb likely
depends on the detailed properties of the plasma, and its extension
may be severely limited by the effect of cooling (see the discussion
in Appendix B). Finally, note that the condition γcool . γ2heat /γmax
becomes very restrictive if γmax is large.

Electron energy distribution

The electron energy distribution may be approximated as a broken
power-law extending over γ & γmin . Both the minimum Lorentz factor, γmin , and the break Lorentz factor, γb , are determined by the
three fundamental energy scales γheat , γcool , and γmax . The main
results are discussed in the following and summarised in Figure 1.

3.2.2

Moderately fast cooling regime (γ2heat /γmax . γcool . γheat )

In this regime the radiative losses within the reconnection layer can
be neglected, while the remaining physics is similar to the ultra fast
cooling regime discussed above. One finds a energy spectrum of the
form dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 extending over γmin . γ . γb and steepening at

4

Sobacchi & Lyubarsky

γ & γb , with γmin ∼ γcool and γb ∼ γheat . As in the ultra fast cooling
regime, the extension of the distribution at γ & γb may be severely
limited by the effect of cooling.
It is important to realise that in the fast cooling regime the
pairs may retain a significant magnetisation after the turbulent component of the magnetic field has been dissipated.
Indeed the kiR heat
netic energy density of the pairs is Ue ∼ γγcool
dγ γme c2 (dne /dγ) ∼
γcool ne me c2 log(γheat /γcool ) . γheat ne me c2 ∼ UB . Most of the dissipated magnetic energy is therefore converted into radiation within
a dynamical time. Since the escape time of the photons from the
dissipation region is also ∼ tdyn , one expects the magnetic and the
radiation energy density to be comparable (UB ∼ Uγ ) if the external
sources of photons can be neglected.

electrons with γiso . γ . γheat remain anisotropic; (iii) if the jet
composition is dominated by pairs (n p m p . ne me ), the distribution
remains anisotropic for all γ . γheat .
Finally, note that if the protons are heated significantly (see
the discussion in the last paragraph of Section 2.1), after the turbulence has decayed the total magnetisation of the plasma is of order
unity (σ ∼ 1) and the bulk motions of the plasma are therefore only
mildly relativistic. Hence, the anisotropy of the distribution is approximately the same both in the frame of the dissipation region
and in the proper frame of the plasma.

4
3.2.3

Slow cooling regime (γheat . γcool )

In this regime the electrons that are heated up to γ ∼ γheat do not
cool within a dynamical time. Hence, one finds that γmin ∼ γheat . If
turbulence accelerates the electrons in a non-thermal tail extending
up to γ  γheat , one expects a spectral break break to appear at γb ∼
γcool as an effect of cooling. In this regime, the energy spectrum
likely depends on the detailed properties of the plasma.
3.3

Anisotropy of the distribution

In the fast cooling regime, most the electrons are impulsively
heated by a parallel electric field before cooling down for the rest
of the dynamical time. Since the IC scattering does not change the
pitch angle significantly while the electron cools (see Appendix B
of Tavecchio & Sobacchi 2019), the momentum of all the electrons
with γ . γheat may remain aligned with the magnetic field in the
proper frame of the plasma.
A possible exception, which is relevant only for electronpositron-ion plasmas, is the following. Sobacchi & Lyubarsky
(2019) have recently proposed that the pitch angle is gyroresonantly scattered by Alfvén waves (not belonging to the turbulent cascade) that grow unstable if the jet has a proton component that dominates the mass density (n p m p & ne me ).1 This process works only for electrons with a Lorentz factor smaller than a
critical γiso , which is of the order of the proton-to-electron mass
ratio m p /me . Hence, we suggest that (i) if the jet has a significant
proton component (n p m p & ne me ) and the initial magnetisation of
the pairs is smaller than γiso (σ0e . γiso ), the distribution becomes
approximately isotropic; (ii) if the jet has a significant proton component (n p m p & ne me ) and the initial magnetisation of the pairs
is σ0e & γiso , the electrons with γ . γiso are isotropised, while the
1

The electrons pitch angle may also be gyro-resonantly scattered by
the turbulent fluctuations. These fluctuations are characterised by a scaledependent anisotropy, namely l⊥ /lk ∼ (lk /L)α where 1/2 . α . 1 (the exact value of α depends on the model), and l⊥ (lk ) is the the scale of the
fluctuation in the direction perpendicular (parallel) to the magnetic field
(e.g. Goldreich & Sridhar 1995; Thompson & Blaes 1998; Boldyrev 2006).
Gyro-resonant scattering by the turbulent fluctuations requires that (i) the
electron travel a distance comparable to lk in a Larmor time, which gives
the usual resonance condition γme c2 ∼ eBlk ; (ii) the electron Larmor radius
is smaller than l⊥ , which gives γme c2 θ . eBl⊥ where θ is the pitch angle in
the proper frame of the plasma (e.g. Chandran 2000). Putting all together,
one finds that θ . l⊥ /lk ∼ (lk /L)α ∼ (γ/γmax )α , namely θ increases with
the electron energy. If γheat  γmax and gyro-resonant scattering by the turbulent fluctuations is the only relevant process, the pitch angle of the bulk
of the electrons remains small.

4.1

ASTROPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS
Blazar jets

The super massive black holes residing in the centre of galaxies
are able to launch jets that reach relativistic velocities. Blazars are
thought to be galactic jets pointing in the direction of the Earth
(e.g. Urry & Padovani 1995). Since the radiation from the jet is
strongly beamed (and often completely outshines the other components, such as the accretion disc), blazars are ideal natural laboratories to study the extreme energy dissipation regimes occurring in relativistic jets. According to a widely accepted paradigm,
galactic jets are launched hydromagnetically (e.g. Blandford 1976;
Lovelace 1976; Blandford & Znajek 1977), with the jet’s energy
budget being initially dominated by the Poynting flux. Turbulent
dissipation of the magnetic energy is therefore a natural candidate
to explain the blazar emission.
The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of blazars is characterised by two broad non-thermal components, the first one peaking
at IR-optical-UV frequencies, and the second one peaking in the γ
rays. The SED follows a well known sequence (e.g. Fossati et al.
1998; Ghisellini et al. 2017): the SED of the faintest objects peaks
at higher frequencies, and the two components have comparable luminosities; these objects usually show weak emission lines (if any),
and are therefore classified as BL Lacs. The SED of the brightest
objects peaks at lower frequencies, and the high energy component is more luminous; these objects often show strong emission
lines, and are therefore classified as Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars
(FSRQ). The first component of the SED is due to the synchrotron
radiation from a population of non-thermal electrons, while in the
context of leptonic models the second component is usually attributed to the Comptonization of either the synchrotron photons
themselves (in the case of BL Lacs), or of an external photon field
(in the case of FSRQ) (e.g. Sikora et al. 1994, 1997, 2009; Ghisellini et al. 1998, 2010; Tavecchio et al. 1998).
Reproducing the broad SED of blazars requires the nonthermal electron distribution to extend over several orders of magnitude in energy. This might be a serious problem if turbulence
heats the electrons slowly (as in the model of Uzdensky 2018),
since in this case a quasi-thermal electron distribution is expected
when the cooling is fast. If instead the electrons are heated impulsively, a power-law distribution of the form dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 is expected over a broad range of energies (γcool . γ . γheat ) as an effect
of fast cooling (see the discussion in Section 3.2), which is in better
agreement with observations.
In the following we discuss the possible application of our
scenario to the interpretation of the SED of FSRQ and BL Lacs. For
a typical B ∼ 1 G and L ∼ 1015 cm in the energy dissipation region,
one finds that γmax ∼ 1012 . Since in blazars typically γheat . 106
(see below), the system has a huge dynamic range (γheat  γmax ).

Non-thermal spectra in relativistic sources
Since γ2heat /γmax . 1, the system is in the moderately fast or slow
cooling regime (see the discussion in Section 3.2).

4.1.1

Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars

Modelling the SED of FSRQ indicates that (i) the dissipation region is magnetised, with the inferred magnetic and electron energy
density being typically not far from equipartition, namely UB ∼ Ue ;
(ii) in most of the objects the bulk of the electrons cool efficiently,
and are consistently distributed as dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 at the lowest energies (e.g. Celotti & Ghisellini 2008; Ghisellini et al. 2010). Such
conditions may naturally arise in a relativistic turbulent magnetised
plasma in the fast cooling regime (see Section 3.2).
The magnetisation of the plasma can be estimated from the
observed SED. The break Lorentz factor of the electron distribution
is γb ∼ 102 when γcool . 102 , and γb ∼ γcool when γcool & 102 (see
Figure 3 of Ghisellini et al. 2010). This is consistent with our model
(see the bottom panel of our Figure 1), and indicates that γheat ∼
102 . Since γheat can be used as a proxy for the magnetisation of the
pairs in the dissipation region, we expect that σ0e ∼ 102 .
Few attempts have been made to quantify the elusive proton component of the jet. Sikora & Madejski (2000) suggested
that ne /n p ∼ 10-100 in order to produce the observed amount of
soft X-ray radiation. Ghisellini & Tavecchio (2010) argued that
ne /n p . 10, since in the opposite case the jet would decelerate
too much while Compton scattering the external photons. More recently, different groups argued that matching the jet power inferred
from the SED fitting and from radio lobe calorimetry requires that
ne /n p ∼ 10-20 (e.g. Kang et al. 2014; Sikora 2016; Pjanka et al.
2017; Fan et al. 2018). These results suggest that in the dissipation region the magnetisation of the plasma (including the protons)
is of order unity, namely σ0 ∼ (ne me /n p m p )σ0e ∼ 1 for a typical σ0e ∼ 102 and ne /n p ∼ 20. Finally, since n p m p & ne me and
σ0e . m p /me , assuming an isotropic electron distribution may be
acceptable (see Section 3.3).

4.1.2

BL Lacs

In the case of BL Lacs, reproducing the SED also requires a powerlaw electron distribution of the form dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 extending over
γ . γb (e.g. Tavecchio et al. 2010). Moreover, since the synchrotron
and the IC peaks of the SED have comparable luminosities, one
would expect the magnetic and the radiation energy density in the
dissipation region to be comparable, namely UB ∼ Uγ .
Even though both these conditions are naturally expected in
a fast cooling turbulent plasma (see Section 3.2), providing a fully
convincing interpretation remains difficult. Indeed, two main inconsistencies arise: under the assumption that the electron distribution is isotropic, fitting the SED indicates that (i) UB  Ue , so
that the jet should be matter dominated even if the proton component is completely absent; (ii) γcool  γb , so that the role of cooling in shaping the electron energy distribution should be negligible
(Tavecchio & Ghisellini 2016; see also Inoue & Tanaka 2016; Nalewajko & Gupta 2017; Costamante et al. 2018).2
2

Note that, if the non-thermal electrons in BL Lacs are not cooling efficiently (γcool  γb ) and the break is therefore not due to cooling, one
would need an acceleration mechanism that produces (i) an electron energy distribution dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 at low energies; (ii) an energy distribution
dne /dγ ∝ γ−p with p > 2 at high energies. To the best of our knowledge, no
such acceleration mechanism has been proposed so far.

5

As shown by Sobacchi & Lyubarsky (2019) and Tavecchio &
Sobacchi (2019), these inconsistencies may be solved if the momentum of the highest energy electrons remains nearly aligned
with the magnetic field, in which case the SED may be reproduced
under equipartition and fast cooling conditions (namely, UB ∼ Ue
and γcool  γb ). Such a scenario appears possible for BL Lacs,
where the typical break Lorentz factor of the electron distribution,
γb ∼ 103 -106 (e.g. Tavecchio et al. 2010), suggests a high magnetisation of the pairs, σ0e ∼ 103 -106 . As discussed in Section 3.3,
in this case the effect of the anisotropy may be important since
σ0e & m p /me .
Though the presence of ions in BL Lac jets is supported by
the recent detection of a high-energy neutrino associated with the
BL Lac object TXS 0506+056 (IceCube Collaboration et al. 2018),
quantifying the ion number density remains difficult. Madejski
et al. (2016) argued that ne /n p & 30 in the BL Lac object PKS
2155-304 in order to avoid an unreasonably large jet power. Taking
the same fiducial value of n p /ne for all BL Lacs, and using the fact
that σ0e & 103 , we estimate that σ0 ∼ (ne me /n p m p )σ0e & 15. This
suggests a higher magnetisation in the energy dissipation region
with respect to FSRQ.
Nalewajko (2016) considered relativistic magnetic reconnection as the energy dissipation mechanism acting in blazars. He suggested that the blazar sequence might be characterised by a systematic trend in the magnetisation of the jet (with lower σ0 in FSRQ
and higher σ0 in BL Lacs) regulated by the efficiency of pair production. Our conclusions are consistent with this suggestion.
4.2

Crab gamma-ray flares

The rapid variability in the gamma-rays is now a well established
property of the Crab Nebula (e.g. Tavani et al. 2011; Abdo et al.
2011; Buehler et al. 2012). The most spectacular April 2011 flare
(Buehler et al. 2012; Striani et al. 2013; Weisskopf et al. 2013)
showed several puzzling features:
(i) The flare lasted for tflare ∼ 9 days. This corresponds to a typical scale ctflare ∼ 2 × 1016 cm, at least one order of magnitude
smaller than the equatorial size of the wind termination shock,
which is ∼ 0.1 pc. Moreover, variability was observed on a time
scale of ∼ 8 hr during the flare.
(ii) The emitted isotropic power above 100 MeV at the peak of
the flare was L ∼ 4 × 1036 erg s−1 , which is ∼ 1% of the total spindown power of the pulsar.
(iii) The spectrum of the flaring component appeared at the
high-energy end of the persistent synchrotron emission, which cuts
off near the synchrotron burn-off limit, εbo ∼ 160 MeV. The spectral peak was observed up to photon energies of εp ∼ 400 MeV,
which is significantly beyond the classical εbo .
(iv) The spectrum was unusually hard, requiring a power-law
energy distribution dne /dγ ∝ γ−p with p ∼ 1.5, or even a monoenergetic distribution. This is inconsistent with the the steeper
power laws (p & 2) expected in shock acceleration (e.g. Blandford
& Eichler 1987; Spitkovsky 2008; Sironi & Spitkovsky 2009).
(v) The cutoff energy of the flaring component and the luminosity above 100 MeV were correlated, the observed correlation being
described by L ∝ εαp with α = 3.42 ± 0.86.
In order to radiate near the burn-off limit, electrons need to
be accelerated by an electric field comparable to the magnetic field.
This suggests that the flares are produced in the polar region, where
the post-shock flow remains strongly magnetised and the bulk motions of the plasma are therefore relativistic (e.g. Lyubarsky 2012;

6

Sobacchi & Lyubarsky

Komissarov 2013; see however Bykov et al. 2012; Zrake 2016).
The post-shock flow initially expands and decelerates but eventually converges because the magnetic hoop stress is not counterbalanced by either the poloidal field or the plasma pressure. Turbulence may develop as a consequence of the instability of such converging flows (e.g. Sobacchi & Lyubarsky 2018).
In our opinion, it is crucial to understand whether a turbulent
plasma may radiate most of its energy near the burn-off limit εbo .
If this is the case, the appearance of flares peaking a factor of a few
above εbo may be due to the intermittent beaming of the accelerated electrons, which is an expected property of turbulent systems
(e.g. Zhdankin et al. 2019). Variations in the relativistic Doppler
boosting may also be consistent with the observed correlation between the peak frequency and isotropic luminosity of the flare (e.g.
Buehler et al. 2012). Note that a relativistic Doppler boosting has
been invoked in different models for the Crab flares, not necessarily based on turbulence (e.g. Yuan et al. 2011; Bednarek & Idec
2011; Komissarov & Lyutikov 2011; Lyutikov et al. 2012; ClausenBrown & Lyutikov 2012).
In the turbulent scenario, the outer scale may be estimated
from the duration of the flare, which gives

The inferred L is comparable to the distance from the pulsar where
the post-shock flow converges (e.g. Lyubarsky 2012; Lyutikov et al.
2018). Since the total magnetic energy of the dissipation region,
E ∼ (4πL3 /3) × (B2 /8π), is dissipated over a time scale tdyn ∼
L/c, we can estimate the emitted isotropic power as L ∼ E /tdyn ∼

The required B is consistent with the hypothesis that the flares
are generated in the polar region. Indeed, in the polar region the
magnetic field may be a factor of a few higher than the typical
one within the bulk of the Nebula, where the magnetisation drops
slightly below unity and B ∼ 1-3 × 10−4 G (e.g. Hillas et al. 1998;
Meyer et al. 2010).

Since γmax > γbo , in principle it is possible for the system to radiate
photons at the burn-off limit.
Interestingly, for the Crab parameters γbo and γmax are of the
same order. This means that most of the flare energy is radiated
by electrons moving at Lorentz factors close to the maximum allowed by the size of the system. Hence, the turbulent dissipation
of the magnetic energy should heat most of the electrons up to
γmax , which may happen when γheat ∼ γmax .3 This condition can
be expressed more transparently in terms of the pair multiplicity,

Since electrons cannot be accelerated up to energies much larger than
γheat (e.g. Werner et al. 2016; Kagan et al. 2018), models of the Crab flares

κe . Suppose to have a relativistic MHD flow, with electromagnetic
fields E ∼ B varying on a scale L. This requires the charge and current densities to be ρ ∼ j/c ∼ B/L. The number density of the free
charges is ne ∼ κe ρ/e ∼ κe B/eL, which using Eq. (3) gives
γheat ∼ γmax /κe .

(12)

Hence, turbulence may power the Crab flares if the multiplicity in
the dissipation region is extremely low, κe ∼ 1 (for a similar suggestion on the multiplicity, see also Kirk & Giacinti 2017 and Section
4.5 of Lyutikov et al. 2018).4 When κe ∼ 1, the system becomes
starved of free charges immediately after turbulence starts to develop, and electrons may be accelerated up to γheat ∼ γmax .
Finally, note that the persistent spectrum of the Crab Nebula
shows a possibly separate emission component in the gamma-rays,
extending from photon energies of ∼ 1 MeV up to the burn-off limit
(e.g. de Jager et al. 1996; van der Meulen et al. 1998; Kuiper et al.
2001). Lyutikov et al. (2019) suggested that this component is associated with the same emission site of the flares. An interesting possibility is that the entire emission above ∼ 1 MeV is due to the same
electrons, which first produce the flares, and then emit at lower energies while cooling down.

CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a scenario for the dissipation of the magnetic energy in relativistic plasmas with a fast radiative (synchrotron and/or
Inverse Compton) cooling. We have focused on plasmas where
the particle number density is dominated by the pairs (electronpositron and electron-positron-ion plasmas). Inspired by the results
of recent PIC simulations of particle heating in relativistic turbulence, we have suggested that:
• Electrons and positrons from the thermal background are impulsively heated up to γheat ∼ σ0e ∼ B2 /8πne me c2 by the strong
electric field aligned with the local magnetic field that arises in intermittently formed current sheets. As an effect of different plasma
compositions, γheat may change by a factor of a few.
• As an effect of fast radiative cooling and of different injection
times, an electron energy distribution of the form dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 is
produced at γ . γheat , while the distribution steepens and becomes
dependent on the detailed properties of the plasma (e.g. magnetisation and amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuations compared to
the background) at γ & γheat .
• Since in the relativistic regime the Alfvén velocity is close to
the speed of light, turbulence decays on the same time scale that
photons take to escape. Hence, the magnetic and the radiation energy densities in the emission site are comparable.

based on reconnection of a Harris current sheet (e.g. Uzdensky et al. 2011;
Cerutti et al. 2012, 2013, 2014) also require that γheat ∼ γmax . An interesting
alternative possibility is explosive reconnection (Lyutikov et al. 2017a,b). In
this case, acceleration may produce two separate sub-populations of electrons, lowering the required magnetisation.
4 The pair multiplicity may be indeed very low in the polar region of the
Crab Nebula. As shown by recent PIC simulations of pulsar magnetospheres
self-consistently including the process of pair creation, the pairs are created
around the equatorial current sheet, while the solution may remain essentially charge separated at higher latitudes (e.g. Chen & Beloborodov 2014;
Philippov et al. 2015a,b; Philippov & Spitkovsky 2018; see Cerutti & Beloborodov 2017 for a review).

Non-thermal spectra in relativistic sources
• Since most of the injected pairs are heated by a parallel electric
field, their pitch angle is initially small. If the plasma has a significant proton component (n p m p & ne me ), pairs with a Lorentz factor
smaller than γiso ∼ m p /me may be isotropised via gyro-resonant
scattering (Sobacchi & Lyubarsky 2019).
This scenario is very different with respect to the one proposed by
Uzdensky (2018), where the electrons are heated slowly (instead of
impulsively) and a quasi-thermal electron energy distribution forms
as an effect of fast cooling. However, note that a quasi-thermal distribution may hardly be consistent with observations that require
extended power-law electron energy distributions.
We have discussed the implications of the outlined scenario
for blazar jets. Modelling the observed Spectral Energy Distribution indicates that the non-thermal electrons are distributed according a power-law of the form dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 for γ . γb . Using the
break Lorentz factor γb inferred from the SED as a proxy for the
magnetisation of the pairs suggests that σ0e ∼ 102 in FSRQ and
σ0e & 103 in BL Lacs. For a typical ne /n p ∼ 10-30, the total (i.e.
including the proton component) magnetisation of the plasma in the
emission site is σ0 ∼ 1 in FSRQ and σ0 & 15 in BL Lacs. The effect
of the anisotropy of the electron distribution might be important to
model the SED of BL Lacs (Sobacchi & Lyubarsky 2019; Tavecchio & Sobacchi 2019). The expected equipartition between the
magnetic and the radiation energy density in the emission site may
naturally explain why in BL Lacs the synchrotron and the Inverse
Compton components of the SED have comparable luminosities.
Finally, we have examined the possibility that the gamma-ray
flares from the Crab Nebula are powered by relativistic turbulence
characterised by a ∼few light days length scale and a ∼mG magnetic field. During the flares most of the energy is radiated by pairs
with a Lorentz factor close to the maximum allowed by the size of
the system. We have shown that this requires the polar region of the
Nebula, where the flares may be produced, to be characterised by a
high degree of charge separation (equivalently, the pair multiplicity
should be of order unity).

APPENDIX A: RECONNECTION IN CHARGE STARVED
CURRENT SHEETS
Throughout the paper we have assumed that most of the turbulent energy is dissipated through reconnection of the anti-parallel
component of the magnetic field across large-scale current sheets.
Thin current sheets spontaneously form in MHD (e.g. Biskamp
2003): even if the thickness λ of the current sheet is initially large
with respect to the dissipation scale, the plasma inside the sheet is
squeezed out with a velocity comparable to the Alfvén speed, and λ
may therefore reach the dissipation scale within a dynamical time.

The dissipation scale can be estimated as follows. From the
Ampère law, ∂E/∂t = c∇ × B − 4πj, one can estimate the current
density inside the sheet as j ∼ cB/λ, which increases as the current
sheet is squeezing. When
λ . λstarv ≡

B
,
ene

(A1)

the required current density exceeds ene c, which is the maximum
sustainable by the free charges that are present in the plasma.
Since ∇ × B is aligned with B in a force-free plasma, a parallel electric field starts growing once the current sheet becomes
√
starved
pof free charges. Note that λstarv ∼ σ0e de ∼ σ0e ρe , where
de ≡ me c2 /4πe2 ne is the electron skin depth and ρe ≡ me c2 /eB
is the electron Larmor radius. In the relativistic regime σ0e  1,
one finds that λstarv  de  ρe . Since the relativistic collisionless
tearing instability grows on the time scale ttear ∼ (λ/de )2 × (λ/c)
(Zelenyi & Krasnoselskikh 1979), the tearing modes are still growing relatively slowly at the scale λ ∼ λstarv , namely ttear ∼ σ0e ×
(λstarv /c)  λstarv /c. Hence, we argue that the anti-parallel component of the magnetic field across the sheet reconnects when the
current sheet becomes starved of free charges, which happens at the
scale λ ∼ λstarv .
APPENDIX B: ON THE EXTENSION OF THE
ELECTRON ENERGY DISTRIBUTION
As discussed in Section 3, in the fast cooling regime an electron energy distribution dne /dγ ∝ γ−2 is expected for γcool . γ . γheat . The
acceleration of electrons at γ & γheat depends on the ratio between
the cooling time scale, tcool ∼ (γcool /γ) tdyn , and the acceleration
time scale due to the stochastic scattering by the turbulent fluctuations, tacc . Using PIC simulations Comisso & Sironi (2019) (see
also Wong et al. 2019) estimated that tacc ∼ tdyn /σe , from which
we find that
tacc
γ
γ
∼

(B1)

γcool γheat
Acceleration by stochastic scattering becomes inefficient once
tacc /tcool & 1, namely when γ & γcool γheat . Hence, in the presence
of very efficient cooling (very low γcool ), the non-thermal electron
distribution cannot extend up to Lorentz factors much larger than
γheat (for a similar conclusion see also Zhdankin et al. 2019).
