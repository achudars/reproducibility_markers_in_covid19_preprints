In quantum spin systems, a phase transition is studied from the perspective of magnetization
curve and a magnetic susceptibility. We propose a new method for studying the anomaly of magnetic
susceptibility χ that indicates a phase transition. In addition, we introduce the fourth derivative
A of the lowest-energy eigenvalue per site with respect to magnetization, i.e., the second derivative
of χ−1 . To verify the validity of this method, we apply it to an S = 1/2 XXZ antiferromagnetic
chain. The lowest energy of the chain is calculated by numerical diagonalization. As a result, the
anomalies of χ and A exist at zero magnetization. The anomaly of A is easier to observe than that
of χ, indicating that the observation of A is a more efficient method of evaluating an anomaly than
that of χ. The observation of A reveals an anomaly that is different from the Kosterlitz–Thouless
(KT) transition. Our method is useful in analyzing critical phenomena.

INTRODUCTION

In condensed matter physics, phase transitions and
their corresponding energy gaps are an important research subject. Researching these gaps is necessary for
studying the behavior of quantum spin systems. Bethe
showed that an S = 1/2 XXZ chain system had the characteristic of the absence of a gap.1 Later, Haldane argued
that the difference between half-spin and integer spin systems involved the gap.2
Many researchers have observed the energy gap via the
magnetization curve as a function of the magnetic field.
The magnetic field at zero magnetization is equal to the
magnitude of the gap. However, the method of observing
the gap is not appropriate for deciding whether a spin
system is gapless or gapped in numerical calculation; it
is difficult to distinguish a gapless system from one with
a very small energy gap.3
Hence, Sakai and Nakano4–7 proposed a method for
distinguishing a gapless from a gapped system. They introduced the magnetic susceptibility and used numerical
diagonalization. They demonstrated that the susceptibility clearly shows the variation of the energy gap with
changing magnetization, in comparison to the magnetization curve. Subsequently, they found the anomaly of
the magnetic susceptibility. The term ‘anomaly’ refers to
a divergence in the thermodynamic limit. This anomaly
usually exhibits a phase transition.
In this paper, we propose a novel method of evaluating
an anomaly by investigating the magnetic susceptibility
χ and the fourth derivative A of the energy with respect
to magnetization. Few investigations of high-order differentials such as A have been carried out. We show
that our method is appropriate for analysis of the phase
transition, compared with the method using the magnetic susceptibility χ alone. The introduction of A resolves the issue of whether the high-order differential of
energy diverges. As a test case, we apply this method to
the S = 1/2 XXZ antiferromagnetic chain, which shows
ferromagnetic phase for ∆ ≤ −1, Tomonaga–Luttinger
(TL) phase for −1 < ∆ ≤ 1, and antiferromagnetic phase
for ∆ > 1. Here, ∆ denotes an anisotropic parameter

associated with the z component of the XXZ antiferromagnetic chain. The lowest energy up to 26 spins of the
chain is calculated by numerical diagonalization on the
basis of the Lanczos algorithm. Subsequently, we analyze
the anomalies of χ and A to observe the phase transition.
The results demonstrate that an anomaly of χ at zero
magnetization exists under ∆ > 1, while an anomaly of
A at zero magnetization is shown for ∆ > 1/2. Hence,
the anomaly of A is easier to observe than that of χ.
The anomaly of A at 1/2 < ∆ < 1 is different from that
of A at ∆ = 1, indicating a Kosterlitz–Thouless (KT)
transition. It is well established that the −1 < ∆ ≤ 1
region corresponds to the TL phase, in which the scaling
dimensions vary continuously with the parameter ∆.8,9
In the ∆ > 1 region, a Neel state appears in which the
ground state is doubly degenerate with an energy gap.
Under the Hamiltonian of the U(1) symmetry, the change
of scaling dimensions from irrelevant to relevant indicates
a KT transition that corresponds to the phase transition
at ∆ = 1 in the S=1/2 XXZ chain. In contrast, the scaling dimensions influencing high derivatives such as A remain irrelevant for −1 < ∆ ≤ 1.10 Thus, the onset of the
anomaly of A at ∆ = 1/2 is different from the KT point
and does not indicate the phase transition. We refer to
−1 < ∆ < 1/2 as TL phase (I) and 1/2 < ∆ ≤ 1 as TL
phase (II), as the TL phase is divided by the anomaly
of A. The scaling dimensions influence the corrections
for various quantities such as energies, susceptibility, and
high derivatives.10 Thus, the anomalies of χ and A indicate the phase transition and the energy gap.
The starting point of the anomaly of A, i.e., ∆ = 1/2,
corresponds to N = 2 supersymmetry (SUSY) from correspondence between the XXZ chain and the free boson model11 and Ashkin–Teller model.12 Moreover, the
results of our computations agree with the exact solutions under 0 ≤ ∆ < 1. These findings indicate that the
method using A is better than that using χ for analyzing
critical phenomena with phase transitions.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the calculation method of χ and A is introduced. In Sec. III, we
present our numerical results for the S = 1/2 XXZ chain.
In Sec. IV, we compare our results with available exact

2
solutions to investigate the behavior of A. In Sec. V, we
reveal that the anomaly of A is associated with conformal
field theory. The correction term is discussed from the
perspective of the boundary conditions and dimension.
In Sec. VI, the anomaly of χ−1 and A is discussed in detail from the perspective of size dependence. Section VII
is the conclusion.

METHOD: MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY χ
AND FOURTH DERIVATIVE A

In this section, we introduce the physical procedure to
calculate the magnetic susceptibility χ and fourth derivative A of energy as a function of magnetization. First,
we define the total spin operator in the z direction as
ŜTz ≡

N
X

ǫ(4) (N, m)
Ŝjz ,

(1)

j=1

where Ŝjz is the jth site spin operator in the z direction and N is the system size. This operator and a
Hamiltonian Hˆ that shows U (1) symmetry commute:
[Hˆ , ŜTz ] = 0. Therefore, the relation is obtained that
Hˆ |ψi = E(N, M ) |ψi ,
ŜTz

|ψi = M |ψi (M = 0, ±1, ....., ±N/2),

(2)
(3)

where E(N, M ) is the lowest-energy eigenvalue, M is the
magnetization, and |ψi is the simultaneous eigenstate.
The energy of Hˆ per site, ǫ(m), in the thermodynamic
limit is then written13
E(N, M )
= ǫ(m),

(4)

where m = M/N is the magnetization per site. In finite
N cases, it is shown that
E(N, M )
= ǫ(m) + C(N, m),
N

(5)

where C(N, m) is a correction term of a finite size. Generally, ǫ(m) is analytic for m in the thermodynamic
limit. The term ‘analytic’ means that the function and
high-order differential are continuous (our study treats
the high-order differential up to the fourth derivative).
C(N, m) satisfies

in finite systems. E(N, M +1)−2E(N, M )+E(N, M −1)
becomes a nonzero constant at large N when finite energy
gaps exist at m. Similarly, E(N, M + 2) − 4E(N, M +
1) + 6E(N, M ) − 4E(N, M − 1) + E(N, M − 2) becomes
a nonzero constant. For example, we consider the XXZ
model at m = 0 and m = ±1/N . For a large anisotropic
limit ∆ ≫ 1 in the Neel region, there is an energy gap at
m = 0 and the energies are written in the form
E(N, M ) = E(N, 0) + |M |∆E,

(12)

where M is the magnetization and ∆E is an energy gap
for a finite system. For large N , substituting Eq. (12)

This means ǫ(4) (N, m) is N 2 times as large as ǫ′′ (N, m).
This fact shows that the anomaly of A appears stronger
than that of χ−1 in the thermodynamic limit. Thus, we
introduce A for observing an anomaly.
Finally, we consider the case in which ǫ(m) is not analytic. ǫ(m) is not analytic for m when ǫ′′ (N, m) or
ǫ(4) (N, m) diverges. In the thermodynamic limit, it is
given by

The same holds for ǫ(4) (N, m). The divergence of
ǫ′′ (N, m) and ǫ(4) (N, m) is equivalent to the fact that
χ−1 and A diverge.

NUMERICAL RESULTS

We calculate the lowest-energy eigenvalue E(N, M )
to derive the magnetic susceptibility χ and the fourth
derivative A, using numerical diagonalization by TITPACK Ver.214 and Hφ.15 As an example, we treat an
S = 1/2 XXZ antiferromagnetic spin chain

where Ŝjx , Ŝjy , Ŝjz is the jth site spin operator in the x, y, z
direction. ∆ is an anisotropic parameter that takes a 0.1
increment of values from 0 to 2. The phase of the chain
is changed by ∆, which shows ferromagnetic phase for

∆ ≤ −1, Tommonaga–Luttinger phase for −1 < ∆ ≤ 1,
and antiferromagnetic phase for ∆ > 1. N is even from
10 to 26. We then give an exchange interaction J = 1.
The boundary condition of the model is periodic:
ŜN +1 = Ŝ1 .

(20)

In this section, we present our numerical data for ∆ =
0, 1, 2 with several sizes from 10 to 20.

A.

Magnetic susceptibility χ and χ−1

First, we show the magnetization dependence of χ in
Fig. 1. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show smooth curves. Figure 1(c) only shows a sharp cusp at zero magnetization.
However, this cusp does not indicate an anomaly, as an
anomaly must satisfy the following conditions: (1) χ,
χ−1 , and A have a cusp, and (2) the size dependence
of the cusp is large in the thermodynamic limit. Thus,
Fig. 1(c) does not show the anomaly as the size dependence is small. Similarly, neither Fig. 1(a) nor Fig. 1(b)
shows the anomaly. The results demonstrate that the
anomaly of χ is not shown.
Next, the magnetization dependence of χ−1 is shown
in Fig. 2. Figure 2(a) does not show an anomaly because
the graph does not have a cusp. Figures 2(b) and 2(c)
have sharp cusps at zero magnetization, compared with
Fig. 1. Thus, it is clearer to observe the cusp of χ−1 than
of χ. However, Fig. 2(b) does not show an anomaly as
the size dependence is small at zero magnetization. In
contrast, Fig. 2(c) demonstrates the possibility of showing an anomaly because the size dependence is large. The
results indicate a possibility that χ−1 shows an anomaly
for ∆ > 1 in the thermodynamic limit. The details are
discussed in a later section.

at zero magnetization. (c) demonstrates that χ−1 shows a sharp cusp of large positive values and high size dependence at zero
magnetization, compared with (b). Therefore, it is easier to observe the cusp of χ−1 than that of χ in Fig. 1. Moreover, it is
possible for χ−1 to show an anomaly for ∆ > 1 owing to its high size dependence at zero magnetization.

We show the magnetization dependence of A in Fig. 3,
which indicates that A decreases as the magnetization
approaches zero for 0 ≤ ∆ ≤ 1. Figure 3(a) does not
show an anomaly as the graph does not have a cusp. Figures 3(b) and 3(c) have sharp cusps at zero magnetization in comparison to Fig. 2. Furthermore, these graphs
show the possibility that A at zero magnetization indicates an anomaly as its size dependence is large. This
shows that it is easier to observe the possibility that an
anomaly exists for A than for χ−1 . The difference between the graphs is the behavior of A at m = ±1/N .
Figure 3(b) demonstrates that at m = ±1/N , A exhibits
negative values. Although A in Fig. 3(b) appears to be
discontinuous near m = 0.1, this behavior is superficial.
In fact, Fig. 4 shows that near m = 0.1, A is continuous for three system sizes: 10, 14, and 20. Thus, A near
m = 0.1 is continuous for ∆ = 1. In contrast, Fig. 3(c)

demonstrates that A at m = ±1/N shows large positive values, in contrast to the large negative value of A
at zero magnetization. The behavior of A indicates the
possibility of showing an anomaly as its size dependence
is large. This is explained by Eq. (16). However, we do
not understand how the behavior of A for ∆ < 1 changes
in the thermodynamic limit. These details are discussed
in a later section.

COMPARISON WITH EXACT SOLUTIONS

In this section, we compare our numerical data with
exact solutions16–20 to investigate the behavior of A. The
behavior of χ is well established for all ∆. However,
the behavior of A has not previously been studied. The
reliability of the data of A increases when the data of χ
agree with exact solutions. This leads to investigation of
the behavior of A.

Comparison with magnetic susceptibility near
saturation magnetization

For the spin S antiferromagnetic chain, the inverse of
magnetic susceptibility χ−1 is proportional to a magnetization S − m near the saturation magnetization.21 In
our case, it is shown that
χ−1 ∝ 1/2 − m.

(21)

We investigate whether our numerical data are consistent
with Eq. (21). Figure 5 shows a magnetization dependence of χ−1 for ∆ = 1 with a fitting function f that
is described by Eq. (21). The fitting is performed under
0.3 ≤ |m| ≤ 0.4. The graph demonstrates a linear relation between χ−1 and m near m = 1/2 because f is
consistent with our data. However, the relation is not
applied to the points where f is not consistent with our
data. Thus, our data of χ are reliable, and the reliability
of our data of A increases.

We then rewrite Eq. (23) as a function of m as it is difficult to compare our numerical data with Eq. (23):

where c1 and c2 are constants. We perform the fitting
with Eq. (25) under 0 < |m| ≤ 0.1. The result of this
fitting is shown in Fig. 6(a). Figure 6(a) indicates that
our data are consistent with exact solutions near zero
magnetization. Therefore, this consistency increases the
reliability of our numerical data of χ for 0 < ∆ < 1.
Next, we explain the exact solution of χ for ∆ = 1.

In this case, although it appears that h π−γ = h0 from
Eq. (23), there remains a possibility of logarithmic behavior from the solutions of a Hubbard model.22 The
Hubbard model is regarded as an isotropic Heisenberg

Fig. 6(b). Figure 6(b) indicates that our data are consistent with exact solutions near zero magnetization. Thus,
our data are consistent with exact solutions in 0 < ∆ ≤ 1.
This indicates that the reliability of the data of A increases with that of χ. However, for ∆ = 1 the magnetic
susceptibility shows an infinite slope when m approaches
zero from Griffiths’s theory. The cause of the differences
between the theoretical and calculated results is a finite
size effect.

The numerical data of A are shown in Fig. 7. Figure 7(a)
indicates that A becomes finite as m approaches zero because its size dependence is small. In contrast, Fig. 7(b)

indicates that A appears to become infinite as m approaches zero from of its large size dependence. Thus,
our data are explained by the tendency of the exact solutions. ∆=1/2 corresponds to N = 2 supersymmetry

where k is the wavenumber of the spin state that is a parameter obtained from translational symmetry. We focus
on the scaling dimension with the wavenumber k = 0 and
zero magnetization, as it is compatible with the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. For ∆ = 1/2, from Eq. (31),
xT (k = 0)=3. The scaling dimensions xT (k = 0) > 2
have irrelevant characteristics.26 Thus, xT (k = 0) = 3
shows the irrelevant characteristics. S.K. Yang12 demonstrated that xT (k = 0) = 3 corresponds to N = 2 SUSY
from the correspondence between the XXZ chain and
Ashkin–Teller model. Later, P. Ginsparg11 showed the
same correspondence from the relation between the XXZ
chain and free boson model. Therefore, these discussions
show that ∆ = 1/2 corresponds to N = 2 SUSY.

with the exact solution of Eq. (25). The fourth differential of magnetization with respect to energy is then
written in the form

ǫ(4) (N, m) diverges for 2 < xT < 3, i.e., 1/2 < ∆ < 1 in
the thermodynamic limit. ǫ(4) (N, m) = 0 at xT = 5/2 is
a subject of future works as few investigations have been
carried out. In addition, we focus on the size dependence
of ǫ(4) (N, m = 0). Considering the Gaussian model,27,31
we extend Eq. (33) in the form

where |M |≪N . Although few investigations into the extension of Eq. (33) have been carried out, with respect
to |M/N |2(xT −2) , we consider that the average distance
between quasi-particles is |N/M |, which is renormalized
by xT . The relation is applied for the fourth differential
in Eq.(11) in the form
ǫ(4) (N, m = 0)

We demonstrate that the ∆ = 1/2 point corresponds
to the N = 2 SUSY in the CFT. We apply the CFT to
the S = 1/2 XXZ chain. The anisotropic parameter of
the chain ∆ is related to the scaling dimension xT , which
is associated with the critical exponent.26 It is shown for

we consider ǫ(4) (N, m) at xT > 2. Next, considering
1/N ∝ m, Eq. (32) is written as

Anomaly and scaling dimensions

Next, we explain ǫ(4) (N, m) at xT = 2, i.e., ∆ = 1.

scaling dimension and phase transition

We explain that the scaling dimension xT is related
to phase transition. To demonstrate this, Fig. 8 indicates the ∆ dependence of the fourth derivative A at zero
magnetization. It appears that A diverges for ∆ > 1/2
as the size dependence is large. This is as expected by
C.N. Yang and C.P. Yang.8,25 However, the anomaly of
A at ∆ = 1/2 is different from that at ∆ = 1 from the
perspective of the scaling dimension xT . Generally, the
−1 < ∆ ≤ 1 region corresponds to the Tommonaga–
Luttinger (TL) phase, which is controlled by the scaling
dimension xT subject to the parameter ∆.8,9 For ∆ = 1,
the anomaly of A represents the phase transition corresponding to the KT transition when the scaling dimension xT changes from irrelevant to relevant for U(1)
symmetry. In contrast, for ∆ = 1/2, the anomaly of A
does not represent the phase transition as the scaling dimension xT is irrelevant in the −1 < ∆ ≤ 1 region.10
Similarly, the anomaly of A for ∆ = 2 does not represent the phase transition as the scaling dimension xT
is relevant in ∆ > 1. Therefore, the phase transition
is controlled by the scaling dimension xT . These facts
show that the anomalies of χ and A represent the phase
transition through the scaling dimension xT . In addition to this, we name −1 < ∆ < 1/2 TL phase (I) and
1/2 < ∆ ≤ 1 TL phase (II) based on the behavior of A
for ∆ > 1/2.
D.

Correction term and boundary conditions

(42)

Therefore, ǫ(4) (N, m = 0) diverges in the thermodynamic
limit.
These facts indicate that the scaling dimension xT
influences the energy gap, magnetic susceptibility, and
fourth derivative for a finite magnetization. The anomalies of χ and A are subject to the change in scaling dimension that is related to phase transition.

The correction term of Eq. (5) changes in relation to
boundary conditions and dimension. First, we discuss
C(N, m) in one-dimensional systems. Without anomaly,
C(N, m) in a periodic boundary condition is written in
the CFT as32–34

smooth function for m. Thus, ǫ′′ (N, m) and ǫ(4) (N, m)
in Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) converges to 1/N 2 order, which
agrees with our numerical results. In contrast, the correction term for an open boundary is given by32–34

where b(m) is a non-universal boundary term. In general, the convergence of this term is worse than that for
a periodic boundary condition. We do not perform calculations for open boundary conditions herein, and leave
them for future work.
Next, we discuss the correction term in twodimensional systems. The correction term quickly converges, as shown by Nakano and Sakai4 , and thus, has
convergence of at least second order. Unlike in the onedimensional case, the convergence depends on the shape
of the lattice. Figure 4 in Ref.4 is different from Fig. 1(b)
from the perspective of an energy gap, although it resembles Fig. 1(b) from previous research.4 This problem will
be addressed in our future works.
VI.

ANOMALIES OF χ−1 AND A

In this section, we investigate the anomalies of χ−1
and A at zero and m = 1/N for 0 ≤ ∆ ≤ 2 from the
perspective of size dependence. In addition, we reveal
the anomalies of χ−1 and A. The origin of an anomaly
is usually a phase transition or Neel state that indicates
double degeneracy of ground states with an energy gap
for the S = 1/2 XXZ chain.
First, the behaviors of χ and χ−1 are shown at zero
magnetization in Fig. 9. Figure 9(a) shows that χ−1
becomes finite for ∆ = 1 in the thermodynamic limit.
This indicates that the system does not have a finite spin

gap or an anomaly. In contrast, Fig. 9(b) shows that χ−1
becomes infinite, i.e., χ reaches zero for ∆ = 2 in the
thermodynamic limit. However, it is not conclusive that
χ approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit. To solve
this problem, we present Fig. 9(c), which is described as
a semi-log graph of Fig. 9(b). Figure 9(c) shows that the
behavior of log χ is consistent with the Ornstein–Zernike
relation, which explains that ln χ ∝ −N/ξ + ln N , where
ξ is the correlation length. Thus, χ for ∆ = 2 approaches
zero, i.e., χ−1 approaches infinity in the thermodynamic
limit. This indicates that the system has a finite spin gap
and an anomaly for ∆ = 2. The origin of the anomaly
is the Neel state. These facts are consistent with the
results obtained by C.N. Yang and C.P. Yang;8,25 thus,
we observed an anomaly of the magnetic susceptibility
in a one-dimensional system. Moreover, the observation
of the anomaly is useful for distinguishing gapped from
gapless systems.
Next, the behavior of A at zero magnetization is shown
in Fig. 10. Figure 10(a) shows that A becomes finite for
∆ = 0.3 in the thermodynamic limit, whereas Fig. 10(b)
shows that it is negative infinity for ∆ = 0.7 in the thermodynamic limit. For ∆ = 0.7, from Eq. (37), A is proportional to N 6−2xT = N 0.6439 , as the scaling dimension
xT = 2.678003 in Eq. (31). Thus, we plot the horizontal axis in Fig. 10(b) as N −0.644 . The behavior of A for
∆ = 0.7 is consistent with Eq. (37), in terms of both the
power index and sign of the divergence. Both Fig. 10(c)
and Fig. 10(d) show that A is negative infinity in the
thermodynamic limit. For ∆ = 1, from Eq. (42), A is
proportional to N 6−2xT = N 2 , as the scaling dimension
xT = 2.0. Thus, we plot the horizontal axis in Fig. 10(c)
as N −2 . The behavior of A for ∆ = 1 is consistent with
Eq. (42), in terms of both the power index and sign of
the divergence. For ∆ = 2, from Eq. (16), A is proportional to N 3 . Therefore, we plot the horizontal axis in
Fig. 10(d) as N −3 . The behavior of A for ∆ = 2 is con-

that A approaches minus infinity and is consistent with Eq. (37) in the thermodynamic limit. Both (c) and (d) demonstrate
that A is minus infinity in the thermodynamic limit. These numerical data are consistent with Eq. (42) and Eq. (16). Thus,
these graphs show an anomaly that indicates Kosterlitz–Thouless (KT) transition for ∆ = 1 and double degeneracy of ground
states for ∆ = 2.

sistent with Eq. (16), in terms of both the power index
and sign of the divergence. These demonstrate that A
shows an anomaly for ∆ = 0.7, 1.0, 2.0. However, the
origin of the anomaly is different. For ∆ = 0.7, the origin is TL phase (II). The origin of the anomaly for ∆ = 1
is the phase transition, which means the transition from
Tomonaga–Luttinger (TL) liquid phase to antiferromagnetic phase.8,9 In contrast, in the ∆ > 1 region, a Neel
state appears for the S=1/2 XXZ chain. Thus, the origin
of the anomaly for ∆ = 2 is the Neel state. Moreover, A
shows the transition for ∆ = 1, although χ−1 does not
show it from Fig. 9(a). The difference is used to confirm
whether a phase transition happens or not. Therefore,
observing A is helpful for determining the consistency of
phase transition.
Finally, we show A at m = 1/N in Fig. 11, as the behavior of A at m = 1/N differs between Fig. 3(b) and
Fig. 3(c). Figure 11(a) shows that A becomes finite for
∆ = 0.3 in the thermodynamic limit, whereas Fig. 11(b)
shows that it is minus infinity for ∆ = 0.7 in the thermodynamic limit. The behavior of A for ∆ = 0.7 is
consistent with Eq. (35). The origin of the anomaly is
TL phase (II). It appears that A in Fig. 11(c) becomes
finite for ∆ = 1. However, the behavior of A is not con-

sistent with Eq. (40), in which A reaches infinity when
m approaches zero. The disagreement results from the
intermediate region in Eq. (40), in which A exhibits flat
and negative behavior, before reaching a sufficiently small
region |m| ≪ 1. Thus, A becomes infinite as the system size becomes larger in our calculation. The origin of
the anomaly is phase transition. In contrast, Fig. 11(d)
shows that A reaches infinity for ∆ = 2 in the thermodynamic limit. The behavior of A is consistent with
Eq. (16). This indicates that A shows an anomaly for
∆ = 2. The origin of the anomaly is a Neel state. Therefore, the behavior of A at m = 1/N in Fig. 3(b) and
Fig. 3(c) is explained by Eq. (16) and Eq. (40). Observation of the change in behavior at m = 1/N can be
proposed as a new technique to distinguish gapped from
gapless systems. Hence, observing A at m = 1/N allows
us to distinguish gapped from gapless systems. However,
future works must focus on the exact solutions of A at
m = 1/N , as few investigations have focused on this behavior.
These findings indicate that observation of A is more
efficient than that of χ. Thus, we expect this technique
to be used for analysis of spin liquids with spin gap issues
in triangular and Kagome lattices.4–7

CONCLUSION

We investigated anomalies of χ and A for the S = 1/2
XXZ antiferromagnetic chain by numerical diagonalization. At zero magnetization, χ−1 shows an anomaly for
∆ > 1. At zero magnetization, A clearly indicates an
anomaly for ∆ > 1/2. In addition, an anomaly of A at
m = 1/N is shown for ∆ > 1. In contrast, in the ∆ < 0
region, future works are required regarding the anomalies
of χ and A in numerical calculations. The results indicate that χ and A have anomalies, and that observing
the anomaly of A is easier than that of χ for relatively
small system sizes. In other words, the observation of
phase transition is easier by A than by χ. We reveal that
the TL phase can be divided into −1 < ∆ < 1/2 as TL
phase (I) and 1/2 < ∆ ≤ 1 as TL phase (II), from the
perspective of the anomaly of A at ∆ = 1/2. Therefore,
we conclude that observation of A is a useful method of
analyzing critical phenomena, compared with that of χ.
Our study is concerned with one-dimensional systems.
However, our method can be used regardless of dimensions. This method will help investigate quantum spin
systems in two or three dimensions. In addition, this

method can be applied to other systems such as spin liquids. The behavior of spin liquids has been studied for
magnetic susceptibility4,7 and our method using A, compared with that using χ, will be useful for researching the
behavior of a spin liquid that has spin gap issues. The
study of using A for other models and higher dimension
is left for future works.
In particular, A relates to the nonlinear magnetic
susceptibility35 of quantum spin systems and is thus of
direct relevance to experiments. The nonlinear magnetic
susceptibility can be easily calculated with high accuracy using A. The method using A can be a new technique in the study of quantum spin systems and strongly
correlated electron systems. Furthermore, the method
will enable one to discover a magnetization plateau observed in experiments that shows constant magnetization
when a magnetic field changes. The plateau indicates the
anomaly of χ, and that of A should also appear there
from Eq.(15), (16). The observations of χ and A will be
useful for evaluating a magnetization plateau. Numerical
diagonalization calculations of A will provide us with a
new development in theory and experiments for quantum
spin systems.
