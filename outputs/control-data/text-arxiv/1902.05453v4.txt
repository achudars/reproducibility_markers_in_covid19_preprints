A paper by Ye, Berdichevsky and Yu features a set of formulas (cf. formulas (11), (12), (19)
in Ye et al. (2014)) for effective stiffnesses of corrugated plates. Without elaborating on said
authors’ actual approach leading to such formulas, we shall focus on the fact that they can be
brought to a simpler form, especially if the corrugation wave is symmetric.
The most involved expression among (11), (12), (19) is the one for A11 , which is the
effective stiffness of a given corrugated plate in the direction orthogonal to its corrugation profile
(from here on we use the notation from Ye et al. (2014)). The most significant ingredient in
computing A11 is the following functional:

jA =

1/ 2

ò

j (Y ) A(Y )dY ,

(1)

-1/ 2

here j = f ' , while the function Y = f ( X ) determines the corrugation profile in the
dimensionless coordinates ( X , Y ) = e -1 ( x, y ) , with ( x, y ) being the standard Cartesian
coordinates, and e being the length of the corrugation wave projection onto Ox in ( x, y )
coordinates (cf. Fig. 3 in Ye et al. (2014)). The above function A( X ) is defined by formula (13)
in Ye et al. (2014):

A( X ) = - ò a (Y )f (Y )dY + B ò a (Y )dY , B =

.

(2)

(see also formula (5.68) in (Ye, 2013) since formula (12) for B in Ye et al. (2014) has a typo).
We shall use integration by parts in order to transform (1) as shown below:

j (Y ) A(Y )dY =

f (Y ) A '(Y )dY =

(3)

a (Y )f (Y )dY

-1/ 2

In (3) we use the equality A '( X ) = - a ( X )f ( X ) + B a ( X ) , which is obtained by
differentiating the first equality in (2), and the condition f ( ±1/ 2) = 0 , which follows from the
definition of f , c.f. Fig.3 in Ye et al. (2014). Thus

jA =

af

1/ 2

a (Y )f (Y )dY .

(4)

-1/ 2

By plugging (4) into formulas (11), (12), (19) from Ye et al. (2014), the latter can be
significantly simplified. These formulas reduce most when B = 0 , which is the case e.g. if the
corrugation wave is symmetric.

In ( X , Y ) coordinates we use the dimensionless thickness of the corrugation profile t = h / e
instead of its actual thickness h . The quantity t determines if we can use the theory of thin
plates (or beams) in our computations, cf. (Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger, 2017).
We have that
af 2 = I y / he 2 , where I y is the moment of inertia along the corrugation
direction in ( x, y ) coordinates (cf. formula (4) in Ye et al. (2014)), while the dimensionless
functional IY0 =

af 2 , for which ( X , Y ) coordinates are used, depends only on the corrugation

profile. Thus j A = IY0 in the case of B = 0 .
As a result, in the case of a symmetric corrugation wave, when B = 0 , by using the latter
equality for j A we can bring formula (19) for the effective stiffness A11 from Ye et al. (2014)
to the following compact form:

A11 =

Eh

discussion that helped improve the initial draft.
