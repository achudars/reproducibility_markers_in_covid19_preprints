equations
Yanqing Wang∗, Wei Wei† and Huan Yu

‡

Abstract
In this paper, we are concerned with regularity of suitable weak solutions of the 3D
Navier-Stokes equations in Lorentz spaces. We obtain ε-regularity criteria in terms of
either the velocity, the gradient of the velocity, the vorticity, or deformation tensor in
Lorentz spaces. As an application, this allows us to extend the result involving Leray’s
blow up rate in time, and to show that the number of singular points of weak solutions
belonging to Lp,∞ (−1, 0; Lq,l(R3 )) and 2/p + 3/q = 1 with 3 < q < ∞ and q ≤ l < ∞
is finite.

Introduction

We focus our attention on the 3D Navier-Stokes system

where the unknown vector u = u(x, t) describes the flow velocity field, the scalar function
Π represents the pressure. The initial datum u0 is given and satisfies the divergence-free
condition.
The global weak solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations was constructed by Leray
[21] for the Cauchy problem and by Hopf [13] for the Dirichlet problem. However, whether
such a weak solution is unique or regular is still an outstanding open problem. In a pioneering work [31], Serrin presented a regularity criteria to the weak solutions to the 3D

Navier-Stokes equations, namely, the Leray-Hopf weak solutions u is bounded in some
neighbourhood of point (0, 0) if u satisfies
u ∈ Lp (−1, 0; Lq (B(1)))

with

2/p + 3/q < 1, q > 3.

(1.2)

Here and in what follows, B(ρ) denotes the ball of center 0 and radius ρ. The critical case
2/p+3/q = 1 in (1.2) was handled by Struwe in [34]. The limiting case L∞ (−1, 0; L3 (B(1)))
was solved by Escauriaza, Seregin and Šverák in [8]. Note that the norm k · kLpt Lqx with
2/p + 3/q = 1 is scaling invariant for u under the natural scaling of (1.1).
It is well-known that Lorentz spaces Lr,s (Ω) (s ≥ r) are larger than the Lebesgues spaces
A natural question arises whether results similar to (1.2) hold in Lorentz spaces.
Indeed, Takahashi [37] gave the first affirmative answer and improved (1.2) to allow the
time direction to belong to Lorentz spaces, more precisely,
Lr (Ω).

u ∈ Lp,∞(−1, 0; Lq (B(1)))

with

2/p + 3/q = 1, 3 < q < ∞.

(1.3)

Afterwards, it is shown that an alternative assumption of (1.3) is
u ∈ Lp,∞(−1, 0; Lq,∞ (B(1)))

with

2/p + 3/q = 1, 3 < q < ∞,

(1.4)

which is due to Chen and Price [5] and Sohr [36]. The endpoint case q = 3 in (1.4) was
considered by Kozono and his coauthor Kim in [16, 17].
In an interesting work, Gustafson, Kang and Tsai [10] found that all regularity criteria
(1.2)-(1.4) and the results in [16, 17, 34] can be derived from the following ε-regularity
criteria of suitable weak solutions to system (1.1): if there exists an absolute constant ε
such that
lim sup ̺
̺→0

1− p2 − q3

ku − u̺ kLp (−̺2 ,0;Lq (B(̺))) ≤ ε,

1 ≤ 2/p + 3/q ≤ 2, 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞,

(1.5)

then u is bounded in some neighbourhood of point (0, 0). Here, suitable weak solutions of
the 3D Navier-Stokes equations were introduced by Scheffer [32, 33] and Caffarelli, Kohn
and Nirenberg [3] to estimate the size of the singular points in the Navier-Stokes system. A
point (x, t) is said to be regular if u belongs to L∞ in a neighborhood of (x, t). Otherwise,
it is singular. Denote the possible singular points set in system (1.1) by S. Two kinds
of ε-regularity criteria to the suitable weak solutions of (1.1) were derived in [3]: (0, 0) is
a regular point provided that one of the two following conditions holds, for an absolute
positive constant ε,

(1.7)

̺→0

The difference between (1.6) and (1.7) is that the former requires only a radius (one scale)
and the latter needs infinite radii (finitely many scales). Since then, there have been extensive mathematical investigations of regularity of suitable weak solutions and many regularity
conditions are established (see [10, 12, 30, 38, 39, 41] and references therein). However, almost all known results involving ε-regularity criteria are discussed in usual Lebesgues spaces
2

and there is a little literature for investigating ε-regularity criteria in Lorentz spaces. An
objective of this paper is to study the regularity of suitable weak solutions in Lorentz spaces.
Before formulating our results, we recall that the gradient of the velocity field ∇u can
be split into a symmetric part D and an antisymmetric part Ω, that is,
T
1
T

(∇u + ∇u ) + (∇u − ∇u )

=: D(u) + Ω(u).

∇u =

(1.8)

D(u) and Ω(u) are usually called as the deformation tensor or rate-of-strain tensor and the
rotation tensor, respectively. (See eg. [22]). Regularity criteria in terms of deformation
tensor in fluid mechanics can be found in [14, 18, 24, 28, 41]. The first result can be stated
as follows.
Theorem 1.1. Let (u, Π) be a suitable weak solution to (1.1) in Q(̺). Then there exists
a positive constant ε1 such that (0, 0) is regular point provided that, one of the following
four conditions holds
(1) u ∈ Lp (−̺2 , 0; Lq,∞ (B(̺))) and

Remark 1.1. Theorem 1.1 is an improvement of (1.5), (1.7) and corresponding result in
[10, 30, 41].
We present some comments on Theorem 1.1. Thanks to inclusion (2.4) on bounded domain in Lorentz spaces, we observe that (1.11), (1.15), (1.19), (1.23) are just the straightforward consequences of known results in [10, 41]. Here, we give the proof of (1.11) and leave
others to the interested readers. Indeed, for (p, q) satisfying (1.12), there exist δ1 , δ2 > 0
such that

p − δ1 q − δ2
Then, by means of inclusion (2.4), we have

kukLp,∞ (−̺2 ,0;Lq,∞ (B(̺))) .

This together with (1.5) implies the desired result.
The more interesting results in Theorem 1.1 are (1.9), (1.13), (1.17), (1.21). By means
of Poincaré-Sobolev inequality (2.2) in Lorentz spaces, we can prove (1) (2) in Theorem 1.1.
To the knowledge of the authors, this type of inequality and its proof were first mentioned
by Malý in [23, Remark 8.3, p.15]. The proof relies on the concept of a median of function
there. As said by Malý in [23], one can follow the path of the proof of classical PoincaréSobolev inequality in Lebesgue spaces presented in [23] to prove this type of inequality.
Here, we will present a new proof to this type of inequality in Lemma 2.1 via the Young
inequality in Lorentz spaces rather than utilization of a median of function. It seems
that this proof is more elementary, self-contained and short than Malý’s proof. Moreover,
general Poincaré inequality (2.9) in Lorentz spaces are also obtained, which is independent
of interesting. Boundedness of Riesz Transform in Lorentz spaces, (1.13) and Biot-Savart
law for the incompressible flows imply (1.17). Parallelly, the generalized Biot-Savart law
below
∂k ∂k ul = ∂k (∂l uk + ∂k ul ).
(1.25)
yields (1.21).

For the ε-regularity criteria at one scale, Barker [1] obtained the following results by
replacing the Lebesgue spaces with Lorentz spaces in spatial direction and improved (1.6)
to
≤ ε.
(1.26)
kukL3 (−1,0;L3,∞ (B(1))) + kuk 32
3 ,∞

(B(1)))

On the other hand, authors in [12] recently generalized (1.6) to
kukLp (−1,0;Lq (B(1))) + kΠkL1 (−1,0;L1 (B(1))) ≤ ε, 1 ≤ 2/p + 3/q < 2, 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞.

(1.27)

As aforementioned, (1.27) and inclusion (2.4) yield the following results.
Theorem 1.2. Let the pair (u, Π) be a suitable weak solution to the 3D Navier-Stokes
system (1.1) in Q(1). There exists an absolute positive constant ε2 such that if the pair
(u, Π) satisfies, for any l1 , l2 > 1
kukLp,∞ ,Lq,∞ (B(1)) + kΠkLl1 ,∞ Ll2 ,∞ (B(1)) ≤ ε2 , 1 ≤ 2/p + 3/q < 2, 1 < p < ∞,

(1.28)

then, u ∈ L∞ (Q(1/2)).
Remark 1.2. Theorem 1.2 is a generalization of (1.6), (1.26), and (1.27).
We give several applications of the ε-regularity criteria in Lorentz spaces obtained above.
Firstly, as a consequence of Theorem 1.1, we have the following results.
Corollary 1.3. Suppose that (u, Π) is a suitable weak solution to (1.1). Then there exists
a positive constant ε3 such that (0, 0) is a regular point provided that one of the following
four conditions holds
(1) u ∈ Lp,∞(−1, 0; Lq,∞ (B(1))) and
kukLp,∞ (−1,0;Lq,∞ (B(1))) ≤ ε3 ,

with

2/p + 3/q = 1, 2 ≤ p ≤ ∞;

(2) ∇u ∈ Lp,∞ (−1, 0; Lq,∞ (B(1))) and
k∇ukLp,∞ (−1,0;Lq,∞ (B(1))) ≤ ε3 ,

with

2/p + 3/q = 2, 1 < p < ∞;

(3) curl u ∈ Lp,∞ (−1, 0; Lq,∞ (B(1))) and
kcurl ukLp,∞ (−1,0;Lq,∞ (B(1))) ≤ ε3 ,

with

2/p + 3/q = 2, 1 < p < ∞;

with

2/p + 3/q = 2, 1 < p < ∞.

(4) D(u) ∈ Lp,∞ (−1, 0; Lq,∞ (B(1))) and
kD(u)kLp,∞ (−1,0;Lq,∞ (B(1))) ≤ ε3 ,

Remark 1.3. To the knowledge of the authors, regularity criteria in terms of ∇u in Lorentz
spaces to the Leary-Hopf weak solutions is due to He and Wang in [11], where they showed
that k∇ukLp (0,T ;Lq,∞ (R3 )) < ∞ with 2/p + 3/q = 2 ensures that u is regular on (0, T ).
Compared with results in [11], result (2) in this corollary allows both the space and time
directions be in Lorentz spaces. Authors in [15] showed the whole space version of (2) to
the Leray-Hopf weak solutions.

5

Remark 1.4. We point out that (1) in this corollary still holds for the Leary-Hopf weak
solutions. Indeed, a Leary-Hopf weak solution u belonging to Lp,∞ (−1, 0; Lq,∞ (B(1))) with
2/p + 3/q = 1 guarantees that u is a suitable weak solution. This fact has been observed in
[10, 38].
Secondly, we turn our attention to the results involving Leray’s blow up rate in time.
In [21], Leray proved that, for q > 3 and sufficiently small ε, if smooth solution u satisfies
ku(·, t)kLq (R3 ) ≤ ε(−t)

3−q
2q

.

(1.29)

then u is regular at t = 0.
Very recently, Kukavica, Rusin and Ziane [20] improved (1.29) to
k(u1 , u2 )kLq (R3 ) ≤ M (ε)(−t)

3−q
2q

and ku3 kLq (R3 ) ≤ ε(−t)

3−q
2q

.

In the spirit of [20], a generalization of Leray’s blow up result is derived from Theorem 1.2,
that is
Theorem 1.4. For q ≥ 3, there exists an absolute positive constant ε such that if a smooth
solution u(x, t) satisfies
ku(·, t)kLp,∞ (R3 ) ≤ ε(−t)

3−q
2q

.

then the solution u(x, t) is regular at t = 0.
Thirdly, the structure of potential singular set S of solutions in (1.1) attracted extensive
research such as upper bound of box dimension or upper bound for the number of singular
points S( see e.g. [6, 7, 12, 19, 25, 35, 38, 42]). We set S(t) = {(x, t) ∈ S}. N (t) represents
the number of S(t). In particular, Wang and Zhang [38] showed that, for any t ∈ (−1, 0],
N (t) ≤ CkukLp,∞ (−1,0;Lq (R3 )) with 2/p + 3/q = 1, 3 < q < ∞.

(1.30)

Choe, Wolf and Yang [7] proved that
N (t) ≤ CkukL∞ (−1,0;L3,∞ (R3 )) .
Here, the finial result is to improve (1.30).
Theorem 1.5. Let u be a Leray-Hopf weak solution and satisfy u ∈ Lp,∞ (−1, 0; Lq,l (R3 ))
where q ≤ l < ∞. Then, there holds
N (t) ≤ CkukLp,∞ (−1,0;Lq,l (R3 )) ,

(1.31)

where 2/p + 3/q = 1 and 3 < q < ∞.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we collect some materials of Lorentz
spaces. Various Poincaré-Sobolev inequality are dealt with in these space. Then, we establish some dimensionless decay estimates. In section 3, we complete the proof of Theorem
1.1. Section 4 is devoted to proving Theorem 1.3 and 1.4.

Notations and a key auxiliary lemma

First, we introduce some notations used in this paper. Throughout this paper, we denote
B(x, µ) := {y ∈ R3 ||x − y| ≤ µ},

B(µ) := B(0, µ),

Q(z, r) =: B(x, r) × (t − r 2 , t),

Q(µ) := Q(0, µ).

For p ∈ [1, ∞], the notation Lp (0, T ; X) stands for the set of measurable functions f (x, t)
on the interval (0, T ) with values in X and kf (·, t)kX belonging to Lp (0, T ). For simplicity,
we write
k · kLp Lq (Q(r)) := k · kLp (−r2 ,0;Lq (B(r))) and

k · kLp (Q(r)) := k · kLp Lp (Q(r)) .

The classical Sobolev space W k,2 (Ω) is equipped with the norm kf kW k,2 (Ω) =
k
P
kD α f kL2 (Ω) . Let W0k,2 (Ω) be the completion of C0∞ (Ω) in the norm of W k,2 (Ω), where

α=0

the space C0∞ (Ω) is the smooth compactly supported functions on Ω. |E| represents the
n-dimensional Lebesgue measure of a set E ⊂ Rn . We will use the summation convention
on repeated indices. C is an absolute constant which may be different from line to line
unless otherwise stated in this paper.
Definition 2.1. A pair (u, Π) is called a suitable weak solution to the Navier-Stokes equations (1.1) provided the following conditions are satisfied,
(1) u ∈ L∞ (−T, 0; L2 (R3 )) ∩ L2 (−T, 0; Ḣ 1 (R3 )), Π ∈ L3/2 (−T, 0; L3/2 (R3 ));
(2) (u, Π) solves (1.1) in R3 × (−T, 0) in the sense of distributions;
(3) (u, Π) satisfies the following inequality, for a.e. t ∈ [−T, 0],

where non-negative function φ(x, s) ∈ C0∞ (R3 × (−T, 0)).
Next, we present some basic facts on Lorentz spaces. Recall that the distribution function of a measurable function f on Ω is defined by
f∗ (α) = |{x ∈ Ω : |f (x)| > α}|.
The decreasing rearrangement of f is the function f ∗ defined by
f ∗ (t) = inf{α > 0; f∗ (α) ≤ t}.
For p, q ∈ [1, ∞], we define

kf kLp,q (Ω) =

Furthermore,

Lp,q (Ω) = f : f is measurable function on Ω and kf kLp,q (Ω) < ∞ .

Notice that identity definition of Lorentz norm can be found in [9, 23]. Indeed, for 0 < p < ∞
and 0 < q ≤ ∞, there holds

Similarly, one can defined Lorentz spaces Lp,q (0, T ; X) in time for p ≤ q ≤ ∞. f ∈
Lp,q (0, T ; X) means that kf kLp,q (0,T ;X) < ∞, where

(2.6)

Next, we turn our attention to Poincaré-Sobolev inequality in Lorentz spaces. Malý first
mentioned this inequality and its proof in [23]. We will give a new proof here.

Remark 2.1. By localization of (2.5) via usual cut-off function as [39] and a slight variant
of the proof of Lemma 2.3-2.5 below, following the path of [39], one can achieve the proof
of (1) in Theorem 1.1 without the utilization of Poincaré-Sobolev inequality 2.7 in Lorentz
spaces.
Lemma 2.3. Let q ∈ [2, 6] and

(2.10)

Proof. For 2 < q < 6, by the interpolation characteristic (2.2) or the Hölder inequality in
Lorentz spaces, we know that there exists a constant 0 < θ < 1 such that
kf − f ̺ kLq,2 (B(̺)) ≤ Ckf − f ̺ kθL2 (B(̺)) kf − f ̺ k1−θ

kf − f ̺ kLq,2 (B(̺)) ≤ Ckf kL2q2,2 (B(̺)) k∇f kL22q(B(̺)) .
Combining this and

where the pair (p, q) is defined in (1.10).
Proof. To localize the pressure equation, we invoke the usual cut-off function φ ∈ C0∞ (B( ρ2 ))
such that φ ≡ 1 on B( ρ2 ) with 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1, |∇φ| ≤ Cρ−1 and |∇2 φ| ≤ Cρ−2 .
By applying the incompressible condition, the pressure equation can be reformulated as
∂i ∂i (Πφ) = −φ∂i ∂j Ui,j + 2∂i φ∂i Π + Π∂i ∂i φ,
where Ui,j = (uj − ūρ )(ui − ūρ ). Before going further, we denote Φ stands for the standard
normalized fundamental solution of Laplace equation in R3 . Then, there holds, for x ∈
B( 3ρ
3 ),
Π(x) =Φ ∗ {−φ∂i ∂j Ui,j + 2∂i φ∂i Π + Π∂i ∂i φ}

(2.17)

Noting the fact that φ(x) = 1, where x ∈ B(µ) (0 < µ ≤ 4ρ ), we know that
∆(P2 (x) + P3 (x)) = 0.
According to the interior estimate of harmonic function and the Hölder inequality, we thus
have, for every x0 ∈ B( ρ8 ),

ε-regularity criteria in Lorentz spaces

In this section, with the decay estimates in Lemma 2.4 and Lemma 2.5, we begin with the

Proof. We first recall the Biot-Savart law
∆u = −curl w.
In particular, we note that
∆u1 = −(∂2 w3 + ∂3 w2 ).
Direct calculation yields that
∆∂k u1 = −(∂2 ∂k w3 + ∂3 ∂k w2 ).
Arguing as we did in (2.17), we write
∂k u1 = R2 Rk (φw3 ) + R3 Rk (−φw2 ) + H(x),
where H(x) is a harmonic function. A modified version of (2.28), we find that

Proof of (3) and (4) in Theorem 1.1. With Lemma 3.1 in hand, the iterative method and

generalized Biot-Savart law (1.25), along the same line, we can complete the rest proof.

Number of potential singular set in lorentz spaces

In the same way as [20], one can finish the proof of Theorem 1.4. For details we refer the
reader to [20]. Next, we follow the path of [38] to prove Theorem 1.5.

Proof of Theorem 1.5. From remark 1.4, we know that the weak solution u is a suitable
weak solution. We denote S(t0 ) = (x1 , t0 ), (x1 , t0 ), · · · , (xM , t0 ) and Bi (̺) = B(xi , ̺) in
this section. We can choose sufficiently small r0 to make sure that Bi (r) ∩ Bj (r) = ∅ for
i 6= j for all 0 < r ≤ r0 . It suffices to show that
