Abstract
We study two entropies of a system composed of two coupled harmonic oscillators which is
brought to a canonical thermal equilibrium with a heat-bath at temperature T . Using the purity
function, we explicitly determine the Rényi and van Newmon entropies in terms of different physical
parameters. We will numerically analyze these two entropies under suitable conditions and show
their relevance.

Introduction

The study of information carried by signals attracted several researchers because of its relevance
to telecommunications. Historically, the first theory on the subject going back to Shannon [1] who
formulated a mathematical tool based on the probability aspects of events and initiated a new field of
research called actually information theory. Indeed, Shannon showed that the amount of information
P
carried by a sequence of events p1 , p2 , · · · can be described by the entropy S(p) = −K N
i=1 pi ln pi
with K a positive constant. It has to verify three conditions on: (i) S(P ) should be continuous in
pi , (ii) S(p) should be a monotonic increasing function of N when all pi = N1 are equally probably,
(iii) S(p) should be additive. Later on, the Shannon theory has been extended to many measures of
information or entropy. One of them is due to Rényi [2], which he was able to extend the Shannon
Trρq
, with a single parameter q > 1.
entropy to a continuous family of entropies of the forms Sq = ln1−q
The entropies Sq cover also that of the von Neumann S1 , which can be recovered by requiring the
limit q −→ 1.
For a many-body quantum system composed of two subsystems (A, B), the bipartite entanglement
between subsystems is described by a state Ψ of the Hilbert space H = HA ⊗ HB . The corresponding
the reduced density matrix ρA = TrB (ρAB ) is obtained by tracing out the density matrix of the full
system ρAB = |ΨihΨ|. Noting that if ρAB is a pure state then it suffices to use the von Neumann
entropy in order to measure the amount of the entanglement. However, the Rényi entropy has further
importance because it provides complete information about the eigenvalue distribution of the reduced
density matrix ρA and therefore completely characterizes the entanglement in an overall pure, bipartite
state [3,4]. In fact, the entanglement encodes the amount of non-classical information shared between
complementary parts of an extended quantum state. For a pure state described by density matrix, it
can be quantified via the Rényi entanglement entropies.
In studying the entanglement in a quantum system, we have proposed a new approach [5] to
explicitly determine the purity function for the whole energy spectrum rather than the ground state
as mostly used in the literature. This was done by choosing the two coupled harmonic oscillators as
system and using the path integral technique as tools to deal with our issues. Among the obtained
results, we have derived a thermal wavefunction depending on temperature that plied a crucial role in
discussing different properties of our system. To prove the validity of our approach, we have showed
that our results reduce to the standard case describing the quantum system in the ground state at
absolute zero temperature. This result has been obtained in our previous work dealing with the
entanglement in coupled harmonic oscillators studied using a unitary transformation [6].
We deal with other issues related to the thermal wavefunction obtained in our work [5]. More
precisely, we study the two entropies corresponding to two coupled harmonic oscillators, which is
brought to a canonical thermal equilibrium with a heat-bath at temperature T . Indeed, we use
our purity function to explicitly determine the Rényi and von Neumann entropies as function of the
temperature parameter introduced through the path integral method. In fact, we show that the von
Neumann entropy can be derived as limiting case q −→ 1 of that of Rényi of order q. To highlight
our results we present different density plots of both entropies and show their basic properties. These
will be done by choosing different configurations of the coupling parameter η, mixing angle θ and
temperature β = kB1T .

The present paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review our main results [5] needed to
deal with our task, which include the derivation of the reduced density matrix and purity function for
two coupled harmonic oscillators. These will be used in section 3 to determine the Rényi entropies
Sq of all orders q as function of different physical parameters of our theory. We numerically focus on
q = 3 to present some density plots showing the behavior of the entropy S3 . In section 4, we consider
the limit q −→ 1 to end up with the von Neumann entropy S1 as particular case. We give three tables
chowing the particular forms of S1 according to the nature of system at high and low temperature as
well as some plots will be presented. We conclude our results in the final section.

Thermal wavefunction

To do our task we review the main results derived in our previous work [5] by considering a system of
two coupled harmonic oscillators of masses (m1 , m2 ) parameterized by the planar coordinates (x1 , x2 ).
This system is described by the Hamiltonian [7]
Ĥ =

where C1 , C2 and C3 are constant parameters. It is clear that the decoupled harmonic oscillators are
recovered by requiring C3 = 0. In the next, we will adopt the path formalism to explicitly determine
the thermal wavefunction corresponding to the present system and later on derive the corresponding
purity function. In doing so, we proceed by introducing the density matrix and particularly the
reduced density matrix.
For imaginary time, the propagator of a system is equivalent to the density matrix for a particle
that is in a heat bath. Thus, the density matrix of the system can be obtained directly from the
propagator under an unitary transformation of angle

In constructing the the path integral for the propagator corresponding to the Hamiltonian (1), according to [8, 9] we consider the energy shift
Ĥ −→ Ĥ − E0 Î

to ensure that the wavefunction of the system converges to that of the ground state at low temperature
(T −→ 0). Now let us introduce the evolution operator

with TD being chronological Dyson operator. Because of the partition function does not determine
any local thermodynamic quantities, then important local information resides in the thermal analog
of the time evolution amplitude [10]

system, with | x1a , x2a i and | x1b , x2b i are the initial and final states. In the forthcoming analysis,
we consider the shorthand notation ρAB (x1b , x2b , x1a , x2a ; β) = ρAB (b, a; β). Using the path integral
method, we obtain the density matrix elements

the whole energy spectrum. This issue and related matters were discussed in our previous work [5]
dealing with the entanglement of our system.
Now we have obtained all ingredients to do our tasks. Indeed, using the standard definition based

as function of the coupling parameter η, mixing θ and temperature β. Note that the purity function
P is the product of two quantities and they are differentiating by the η sign of the numerator and the
geometric functions in the denominator. Moreover, we notice that the derivation of such P is actually
based on exact calculation without use of approximation and it is corresponding to the whole energy
spectrum.
Right now we have settled the need materials to do our task and next we see how to use them in
order to determine some interesting quantities those measure the amount of information for a given
system. More precisely, because of the purity function is linked to some entropies, then we will show
that two entropies can be derived from our results. These will be analyzed according to choice of
different configurations of the coupling parameter, mixing angle and temperature.

Rényi entropy

The definition of entropy does not in any way require the notion of an observer, but requires one has to
specify the subspace of the system under consideration in order to get the density matrix. An observer
may measure different entropies depending on which aspects of the system is considered. Concretely,
for a system of two entangled particles one will measure different entropies for each of the particles
independently than the full entangled state. In general, the lack of information or the mixedness about
the preparation of a given state, can be quantified by using generalized entropic measures, such as the
Rényi entropy [11]
ln Trρq
(31)
Sq =
1−q
and the Bastiaans-Tsallis entropy [12, 13]
SqBT =

1 − Trρq
q−1

(32)

where the parameter verifies the condition q > 1. It is clearly seen that they have two interesting
limiting cases. Indeed, for q = 2 and from SqBT we recover the well-known linear entropy
S2BT = SL = 1 − Trρ2

(33)

which has range between zero associated to a completely pure state and (1 − 1/d) associated to a
completely mixed state, with d is the dimension of the density matrix ρ. Note that, the linear entropy
is trivially related to the purity function P of a state via SL = 1 − P. For the limit q −→ 1, we end
up with the von Neumann entropy
SV = lim SqBT = lim Sq = −Tr(ρ ln ρ)
q−→1+

q−→1+

(34)

which is additive on tensor product states and provides a further convenient measure of mixedness of
the quantum state.
Having obtained the purity function P , let us show how to drive the Rényi and von Neumann
0
entropies for two coupled harmonic oscillators In doing so, we need first to write ρA

At this stage, we can numerically analyze the Rényi entropies and underline their behaviors by
choosing some configurations of the physical parameters. For numerical difficulties, we restrict ourselves to the entropy S3 , which can be obtained simply by fixing q = 3 in (38)

Figure 1 presents the Rényi entropy S3 versus the coupling parameter η and the mixing angle θ for
fixed values of the temperature β = 1, 2, 5, 10. We observe that the entropy S3 is periodic with respect
to the mixing angle θ = π and increases from minimal to maximal values. Also S3 shows a symmetric
behavior with respect to η = 0 and it is null for a given interval of η independently to the values taken
by θ. This behavior changes as long as the temperature is decreased from β = 1 to β = 10. This
tell us how the temperature can be used to control the behavior of our system and therefore it offers
another way to handle its correlations.

Figure 2 shows the Rényi entropy S3 as function of the temperature β and the mixing angle θ for
four values of the coupling parameter η = 1, 2, 3, 4. We observe that there are periodicity with respect
to θ such that the same behavior repeats in [0, π] and [π, 2π]. It is clearly seen that S3 is maximal at
high temperature while it is minimal for low temperature. As long as η is increased, we notice that S3
increases rapidly to reach the maxima values as shown for the case η = 4. In Figure 3, we present the
Rényi entropy S3 as function of the coupling parameter η and the temperature β for fixed values of
the mixing angle θ = π2 , π3 , π4 , π8 . We observe that S3 shows a symmetric behavior with respect to the
value η = 0 and decreases as long as θ decreased from π2 to π8 . We conclude that the Rényi entropy
can be controlled and adjusted by different parameters to extract some information about our system.
This is clearly seen from different configurations chosen to obtain such plots in many shapes of Figures
1,2,3.

von Neumann entropy

To accomplish our study about some entropies, we establish a relation between the von Neumann
entropy and the purity function (30) of our system. This can be worked out to end up with the

of the temperature β and the mixing angle θ for fixed values of the coupling parameter η = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Figure 6 shows S1 as function of the the coupling parameter η and the temperature β for fixed values
of the mixing angle θ = π2 , π3 , π4 , π8 . Compared to those of the Rényi entropy S3 , such Figures present
some some similarities and differences.
To close our study it is interesting to summarize in three different tables below the most interesting
form can be taken by the von Neumann entropy S1 for particular values of the coupling parameter
and mixing angle as well as low and high temperature regimes. Indeed, we start by analyzing two
situations with respect to the strength of the coupling parameter η, which will allow us to underline
the behavior of our system. We start with the weak coupling that is characterized by taking the limit
C3 −→ 0 where the angle θ −→ θw and the coupling η −→ ηw . In this case, (2) and (13) reduce to
the following quantities

The last situation is related to the nature of our system, which is equivalent to require that both
of harmonic oscillators have the same mass m1 = m2 and frequency C1 = C2 . Thus from (2) and (13),

The corresponding entropies can be summarized as function of the temperature Table 2 and function

have different forms of the von Neumann entropies, which can be simplified by replacing the purity
function by their forms under the conditions taken into consideration.

Conclusion

We have studied two interesting entropies for a system of two coupled harmonic oscillators by using
the path integral mechanism. In doing so, we have involved a global propagator based on temperature
evolution of our system. Considering a unitary transformation we were able to explicitly obtain the
reduced density matrix and therefore the thermal wavefunction describing the whole spectrum of our
system. These allowed us to derive the purity function characterizing the entanglement of our system
in terms of temperature and coupling parameter [5].
We have used our previous results obtained in [5] to build in the first stage the Rényi entropies Sq
for all parameter q > 1. To illustrate such study we have focused on q = 3 and presented different plots
showing the particularities of the entropy S3 . Subsequently, we have determined the von Neumann
entropy S1 , which corresponds to the limiting case q −→ 1 of the Rényi entropies. We numerically
analyzed S1 by offering some plots under some choice of the coupling parameter, rotating angle and
temperature. For its relevance we have considered particular cases and derived the corresponding von
Neumann entropies. For this, we have gave three different tables showing the values can be taken by
S1 according to the nature of our system as well as the temperature regime.
