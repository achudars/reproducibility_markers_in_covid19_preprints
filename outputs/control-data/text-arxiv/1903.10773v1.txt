Based on the scenario that a K̄NN bound state is generated and it eventually decays into Λp, we calculate the cross section of the K −3 He → Λpn reaction, which was recently measured in the J-PARC
E15 experiment. We find that the behavior of the calculated differential cross section d 2 σ/dMΛp dqΛp ,
where MΛp and qΛp are the Λp invariant mass and momentum transfer in the (K − , n) reaction in the
laboratory frame, respectively, is consistent with the experiment. Furthermore, we can reproduce
almost quantitatively the experimental data of the Λp invariant mass spectrum in the momentum
transfer window 350 MeV/c < qΛp < 650 MeV/c. These facts strongly suggest that the K̄NN bound
state was indeed generated in the J-PARC E15 experiment.
KEYWORDS: K̄NN bound state, reaction calculation for the J-PARC E15 experiment

1. Introduction
Because the chiral K̄N interaction is strongly attractive and dynamically generates the Λ(1405) [1–
6], it is natural to extend the idea from the K̄N bound state [Λ(1405)] to the K̄NN bound state. The
K̄NN bound state is a good ground to apply techniques of few-body calculations and to investigate
further properties of the K̄N interaction. Until now a lot of effort has been put into theoretical predictions and experimental searches for the K̄NN bound state (see Ref. [7] for the status up to 2015).
Recently, in the J-PARC E15 experiment the cross section of the K −3 He → Λpn reaction was
measured and a peak structure was found in the Λp invariant mass spectrum around the K − pp threshold [8, 9]. One of the biggest advantages of this reaction is to put K̄ directly into the nucleus to
generate the K̄NN bound state. Thanks to that, we can theoretically trace the behavior of the K̄ in the
K −3 He → Λpn reaction [10]. As a result, the first run data of the J-PARC E15 experiment [8] were
well reproduced in the scenario that the K̄NN bound state is generated.
In this manuscript we perform further theoretical analysis on the K −3 He → Λpn reaction measured in the J-PARC E15 experiment, in particular focusing on its second run data [9].

2. Formulation
We calculate the cross section of the K −3 He → Λpn reaction in the same manner as in our
previous paper [10] except for one thing: the treatment of the K̄N → K̄N scattering amplitude at the

first collision denoted by T 1 . In Ref. [10] we fixed T 1 as a real number by using the experimental
values of the K̄N → K̄N differential cross sections only at an initial kaon momentum 1.0 GeV/c in
the laboratory frame. Namely, we neglected the Fermi motion of the nucleons and fixed the invariant
mass of the first-collision K̄N, w1 , to a unique value. In contrast, now we take into account the Fermi
motion of the nucleons to evaluate w1 and treat T 1 in a 2 × 2 matrix form in terms of the partial waves:
T 1 (w1 , pout , pin ) = g(w1 , pout , pin , x) − ih(w1 , pout , pin , x)

(pout × pin ) · σ

where pout and pin are outgoing and incoming momenta of K̄ in the K̄N rest frame, pout,in ≡ |pout,in |,
x ≡ pout · pin /(pout pin ), σ are the Pauli matrices acting on the baryon spinors, and g and h are expressed
in terms of the partial-wave amplitudes T L± as
g(w, pout , pin , x) =

with the Legendre polynomials PL (x), P′L (x) ≡ dPL /dx, and orbital angular momentum L.
Because the K̄N → K̄N scattering at the first collision takes place with bound nucleons, it is
better to treat the partial-wave amplitudes T L± as functions of three independent variables w1 , pout ,
and pin , i.e., as off-shell amplitudes. We here assume that the partial-wave amplitudes depend on the
momenta minimally required by the kinematics, i.e., they are proportional to (pout pin )L . Under this
assumption, the partial-wave amplitudes can be easily evaluated from the on-shell ones in the formula
on-shell
T L± (w, pout , pin ) = T L±
(w)

(pout pin )L

where pon-shell (w) is the on-shell momentum for the K̄N system with the center-of-mass energy w. In
on-shell (w) of Ref. [11], where the authors
the present study, we utilize the on-shell K̄N amplitudes T L±
calculated K̄N amplitudes up to the F wave (L = 4) based on a dynamical coupled-channels model
with phenomenological SU(3) Lagrangians, to evaluate the amplitudes T L± (w, pout , pin ).

3. Numerical results
We now calculate the differential cross section d2 σ/dMΛp d cos θncm of the K −3 He → Λpn reaction, where MΛp is the Λp invariant mass and θncm is the neutron scattering angle in the global
center-of-mass frame, in the scenario that a K̄NN bound state is formed, decaying eventually into a
Λp pair. The formulation is the same as in the previous calculation [10] except for the K̄N → K̄N
amplitude at the first collision, which now takes the Fermi motion into account. We then multiply
d2 σ/dMΛp d cos θncm by |∂ cos θncm /∂qΛp |, where qΛp is the momentum transfer in the (K − , n) reaction
in the laboratory frame, to obtain the differential cross section d2 σ/dMΛp dqΛp . Note that, for a fixed
MΛp , the momentum transfer reaches its minimum at cos θncm = 1 and increases as cos θncm decreases.
In Fig. 1 we show the numerical result of the differential cross section d2 σ/dMΛp dqΛp in the
K̄NN bound-state scenario. Here we take two options A and B for the evaluation of the energy
carried by the K̄ (for the details see Ref. [10]). From Fig. 1, in both options A and B, we can see that
the structure near the K − pp threshold (2.37 GeV) is generated dominantly in the lower qΛp region,
which corresponds to the condition of forward neutron scattering. In addition, we observe two trends
in d2 σ/dMΛp dqΛp ; one goes from MΛp = 2.35 GeV at qΛp = 0.25 GeV to the upward direction, and
the other goes from the K − pp threshold at qΛp = 0.2 GeV to the upper-right direction. As discussed

in Ref. [10], the former is the signal of the K̄NN bound state, and the latter is the contribution from
the quasi-elastic scattering of the K̄ at the first collision. Interestingly, the behavior of the two trends
in d2 σ/dMΛp dqΛp was indeed observed in the second run data of the J-PARC E15 experiment [9],
and hence our result is consistent with the experimental result.
Next we integrate the differential cross section d2 σ/dMΛp dqΛp to obtain the invariant mass spectrum dσ/dMΛp , which is shown in Fig. 2. When we take into account the whole region of the momentum transfer, we obtain lines “Full” in Fig. 2. In this case, we observe a two-peak structure around
the K − pp threshold as we found in Ref. [10]; the peak below (above) the K − pp threshold originates
from the K̄NN bound state (quasi-elastic scattering of the K̄ at the first collision). Then, we restrict
the momentum transfer to the region 350 MeV < qΛp < 650 MeV, as done in the experimental analysis [9], where they aimed at reducing the kinematic peak above the K − pp threshold corresponding
to the quasi-elastic K̄ scattering. Our mass spectrum with the momentum-transfer cut is plotted as
lines “Cut” in Fig. 2. With this cut, only the peak for the signal of the K̄NN bound state survives. In
this sense, our result supports the validity of the experimental cut of the momentum transfer.
Finally, we compare the calculated invariant mass spectrum dσ/dMΛp in the momentum transfer
window 350 MeV < qΛp < 650 MeV with the experimental one in the same window. The result is
shown in Fig. 3. As for the experimental data, we subtract the background contribution in the analysis
of the experiment [9], because we do not take into account background but rather the generation of the
K̄NN bound state. From Fig. 3, in both options A and B, we can see that our calculation reproduces
almost quantitatively the experimental data of the Λp invariant mass spectrum with the momentum
transfer cut throughout a wide range of the Λp invariant mass. The consistent behavior of the mass

4. Summary
In this manuscript we have investigated the origin of the peak structure of the Λp invariant mass
spectrum near the K − pp threshold in the K −3 He → Λpn reaction, which was recently observed in the
J-PARC E15 experiment. For this purpose, we have calculated the cross section of the K −3 He → Λpn
reaction and Λp invariant mass spectrum based on the scenario that a K̄NN bound state is generated
and it eventually decays into Λp. As a result, we have found that the behavior of the calculated differential cross section d2 σ/dMΛp dqΛp is entirely consistent with the experimental data. In particular,
the peak for the quasi-elastic scattering of the K̄ at the first collision in the Λp invariant mass spectrum, which exists above the K − pp threshold, is highly suppressed when we restrict the momentum
transfer to the region 350 MeV < qΛp < 650 MeV, as done in the experimental analysis [9]; with
this cut only the peak for the K̄NN bound state below the K − pp threshold survives. Furthermore,
throughout a wide range of the Λp invariant mass, our calculation reproduces almost quantitatively
the experimental mass spectrum with the momentum transfer cut. These findings strongly suggest
that the K̄NN bound state was indeed generated in the J-PARC E15 experiment.
