THE CHROMATIC BRAUER CATEGORY AND ITS LINEAR
REPRESENTATIONS
L. FELIPE MÜLLER AND DOMINIK J. WRAZIDLO
Abstract. The Brauer category is a symmetric strict monoidal category that
arises as a (horizontal) categorification of the Brauer algebras in the context
of Banagl’s framework of positive topological field theories (TFTs). We introduce the chromatic Brauer category as an enrichment of the Brauer category
in which the morphisms are component-wise labeled. Linear representations
of the (chromatic) Brauer category are symmetric strict monoidal functors
into the category of real vector spaces and linear maps equipped with the
Schauenburg tensor product. We study representation theory of the (chromatic) Brauer category, and classify all its faithful linear representations. As
an application, we use indices of fold lines to construct a refinement of Banagl’s
concrete positive TFT based on fold maps into the plane.

1. Introduction
The Brauer algebras Dm have first appeared in work of Brauer [6] on representation theory of the orthogonal group Opnq. In view of Schur-Weyl duality, they
replace the role played by the group algebras of symmetric groups in representation
theory of the general linear group. Generators of Dm are the diagrams consisting
of 2m vertices and m edges, where the vertices are arranged in two parallel rows
of m vertices, and each vertex lies in the boundary of exactly one edge. Given
a commutative ground ring k with unit, Dm is the kpxq-algebra freely generated
as kpxq-module by those diagrams. Multiplication is induced by concatenation of
diagrams, where each arising free loop component gives rise to an additional multiplication with the indeterminate x. A signed variant of Brauer algebras has been
studied in [22]. Brauer algebras play an important role in knot theory, where,
for instance, Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras [5, 21, 26], which are the quantized
version of Brauer algebras, have been used to construct generalizations of the Jones
polynomial.
We are concerned with a natural (horizontal) categorification Br of Brauer’s
algebras that has been used by Banagl [3, 4] in search of new topological invariants
in the context of his framework of positive topological field theory (TFT). A similar
category has been considered independently by Lehrer-Zhang [18] in a modern categorical approach to the invariant theory of the orthogonal and symplectic groups.
Roughly speaking, morphisms in the so-called Brauer category Br are represented
by 1-dimensional unoriented tangles in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. In
particular, generators and relations for the strict monoidal category Br have been
listed in [4] (compare also [18]) by adapting the methods that are used by Turaev
[25] for deriving a presentation for the category of tangle diagrams.
Let us discuss the main ideas behind Banagl’s notion of positive TFT, and the
role of the Brauer category Br and its representation theory in this context. By
definition, the axioms for positive TFT [3] differ from Atiyah’s original axioms for
TFT [1] in that they are formulated over semirings instead of rings. Recall that
semirings are not required to have additive inverse (“negative”) elements. In computer science, semirings and related structures have been studied by Eilenberg [7]
in the context of automata theory and formal languages. The essential advantage of
positive TFTs over usual TFTs is that so-called Eilenberg completeness of certain
semirings can be used to give a rigorous construction of positive TFTs of arbitrary dimension. This construction is implemented by Banagl in a process he calls
quantization that requires so-called fields and an action functional as input (see
Section 5.1). Inspiration comes from theoretical quantum physics, where the state
sum is expressed by fields and an action functional via the Feynman path integral.
In [4], Banagl applies his framework of quantization to produce in arbitrary dimension an explicit positive TFT for smooth manifolds. The construction uses
singularity theory of so-called fold maps, and the resulting state sum invariants
can distinguish exotic smooth spheres from the standard sphere. Now, in this concrete setting, the role of fields is played by certain fold maps into the plane, and
the action functional assigns to such fields morphisms in the Brauer category Br
by extracting the 1-dimensional patterns that arise from the singular locus of fold
maps. However, as pointed out in Section 8 of [3], it is desirable to compose such
a category-valued action functional with a symmetric strict monoidal functor from
Br to the category Vect of real vector spaces and linear maps. Note that one

requires the category Vect to be equipped with a symmetric strict monoidal structure, which is provided by using the Schauenburg tensor product [24]. In this way,
the Brauer category serves only as an intermediary structure, and the state sum of
the resulting positive TFT will become accessible through linear algebra. Of course,
the loss of information should be kept at a minimum during this linearization process, which is motivation for studying faithfulness of such linear representations
Br Ñ Vect. This knowledge is required when it comes to the explicit computation
of state sum invariants (compare Section 6.3 and Section 10.5 in [27] as well as
Remark 9.5 in [28]).
In this paper we determine not only the faithful representations of Br, but also
those of the chromatic Brauer category cBr which will be introduced in Section 3.2
as an enrichment of Br in which morphisms are component-wise labeled (“colored”)
by elements of a countable index set. Hence, in contrast to the Brauer category,
isomorphic objects of the chromatic Brauer category need not be equal. Our reason
for considering cBr is that it can be used to construct a refinement of Banagl’s
positive TFT based on fold maps in the following way (see Section 5). In analogy
with the index of non-degenerate critical points in Morse theory, one can associate a
(reduced) index to the singularities of a fold map. Those fold indices are intrinsically
defined, locally constant along the singular set, and carry topological information
about the source manifold. For fold maps from n-dimensional source manifolds into
the plane, the set of possible fold indices is t0, . . . , tpn ´ 1q{2uu. We will modify
Banagl’s original construction by defining a cBr-valued action functional which
additionally remembers indices of fold lines as labels from the set N “ t0, 1, 2, ...u
of natural numbers.
Concerning linear representations of Br, Banagl has shown in Proposition 2.22
of [4] that there exist linear representations that are faithful on loops. This suffices
for his purpose to show that state sum invariants of the positive TFT are able to
detect exotic smooth structures on spheres. As a much more general result, we
have the following
Theorem 1.1 ([20, 27]). Let Y : Br Ñ Vect be a symmetric strict monoidal functor from the Brauer category into the category of real vector spaces and linear maps
(equipped with the Schauenburg tensor product). Then the vector space Y pr1sq has
finite dimension d. Moreover the functor Y is faithful if and only if d ě 2.
What is more, we will show Theorem 1.2 below. Since the Brauer category is
naturally (monochromatically) embedded in the chromatic Brauer category, Theorem 1.1 is implied by Theorem 1.2. (To conclude this, one has to use that any
linear representation of Br can be extended to one of cBr by means of our structure
results Theorem 3.5 and the corresponding result for Br.)
In preparation of the statement of our result on linear representations of cBr,
note that the objects of cBr that are mapped to the object r1s of Br under the
forgetful functor cBr Ñ Br are parametrized by the labels k P N, say pr1s, kq.
Theorem 1.2. Let Y : cBr Ñ Vect be a symmetric strict monoidal functor from
the chromatic Brauer category into the category of real vector spaces and linear
maps (equipped with the Schauenburg tensor product). Then, for each k P N, the
vector space Y ppr1s, kqq is of finite dimension, say dk . Suppose that dk ą 0 for all
k P N. Then, the functor Y is faithful if and only if the sequence d0 , d1 , . . . satisfies

In particular, faithful linear representations of cBr exist because one can take

that implication (1.1) holds for all plk qkPN P k“0 Z is not equivalent to saying that
every finite subset of the sequence d0 , d1 , . . . is relatively prime (e.g., take d0 , d1 , . . .
to be the double 6, 10, 14, . . . of the sequence of odd prime numbers).
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we recall fundamental facts
about monoidal categories in general, and the Schauenburg tensor product in particular. The chromatic Brauer category is introduced in Section 3, where its linear
representations are classified by Theorem 3.5. The proof of our main result Theorem 1.2 will be given in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss our application
to Banagl’s positive TFT based on fold maps.
Notation. Throughout the paper, the natural numbers will be meant to be the
set N “ t0, 1, 2, . . . u (including zero).

2. Preliminaries on strict monoidal categories
In this section, we introduce the definitions and notational conventions on strict
monoidal categories (Section 2.1) and the Schauenburg tensor product (Section 2.2)
that will be used throughout the paper.
2.1. Strict monoidal categories. We refer to Kassel [12] for the basic definitions
that are recalled in this section.
A monoidal category pC, b, I, α, λ, ρq is a category C equipped with a bifunctor
b : CˆC Ñ C, an object I P ObpCq, called unit with respect to the tensor product
b, and three isomorphisms
αX,Y,Z : pX b Y q b Z Ñ X b pY b Zq, λX : I b X Ñ X and ρY : Y b I Ñ Y,
which are functorial in X, Y, Z P ObpCq. Furthermore, α, λ and ρ satisfy the
coherence conditions given by the pentagon axiom and triangle axiom. These are

αW,XbY,Z

pW b pX b Y qq b Z

and
ρY b 1 X

,

for all W, X, Y, Z P ObpCq. Here, α is called associativity constraint, and λ and ρ
are called left and right unit constraints, respectively. A monoidal category C is
called strict if the associativity and unit constraints α, λ, ρ are given by identity
morphisms of the category.
If pC, b, I, α, λ, ρq is a (strict) monoidal category, then we will call the data
pb, I, α, λ, ρq a (strict) monoidal structure on C. In most of the paper, we work
with strict monoidal categories. In that case, we will omit the associativity and
unit constraints in the notation of a monoidal category, i.e. we will write pC, b, Iq
instead of pC, b, I, α, λ, ρq.
Let C and D be monoidal categories. A monoidal functor is a functor F : C Ñ D
which respects the monoidal structure. To be more precise, it is a functor
pF, ξ, ξ0 q : pC, bC , IC , αC , λC , ρC q Ñ pD, bD , ID , αD , λD , ρD q,
with isomorphisms ξX,Y : F pXq bD F pY q Ñ F pX bC Y q for all X, Y P ObpCq,
functorial in X, Y , i. e. for morphisms f : X Ñ X 1 and g : Y Ñ Y 1 the diagram

commute for all X, Y, Z P ObpCq. The monoidal functor pF, ξ, ξ0 q is called strict if
the isomorphisms ξ0 and ξ are identity morphisms of D.
Let pC, b, I, α, λ, ρq be a monoidal category. A symmetric braiding b on C is
a monoidal functorial isomorphism b : b Ñ b ˝ τ , where the map τ : ObpCq ˆ
ObpCq Ñ ObpCq ˆ ObpCq is given by τ pX, Y q “ pY, Xq for any pair pX, Y q of
objects of the category C, satisfying the hexagon axiom, the unity coherence, and
the inverse law which are given by the commutativity of the diagrams

respectively, for all X, Y, Z P ObpCq. A monoidal category C together with a
symmetric braiding b is called symmetric monoidal category.
Let pC, b, IC , bC q and pD, d, ID , bD q be symmetric strict monoidal categories.
A monoidal functor pF, ξ, ξ0 q : C Ñ D is called symmetric if F is compatible with
´1
the symmetric structures, i.e. if F pbC X,Y q “ ξF pY q,F pXq ˝ bD F pXq,F pY q ˝ ξX,Y
for all
X, Y P ObpCq.
2.2. The Schauenburg tensor product. The usual tensor product b in the
category Vect of real vector spaces and linear maps determines a monoidal structure
on Vect (with unit object I “ R) which is certainly not strict. When studying linear
representations of strict monoidal categories, it is appropriate to endow Vect with
a strict monoidal structure. As described in Theorem XI.5.3 in [12, p. 291], there
is a general method for turning any given monoidal category C into a monoidally
equivalent strict monoidal category Cstr . However, this procedure changes the
category even on the object level, which is probably not convenient for studying
properties of linear representations. Banagl employs an explicit strict monoidal
structure on Vect, namely the Schauenburg tensor product d introduced in [24].
The resulting strict monoidal category pVect, d, Iq is monoidally equivalent to the
usual monoidal structure on Vect obtained by b. The advantage of Schauenburg’s
construction is that the monoidal equivalence pF, ξ, ξ0 q can be chosen in such a way

THE CHROMATIC BRAUER CATEGORY AND ITS LINEAR REPRESENTATIONS

that F is the identity on Vect, and ξ0 is the identity on I (see Theorem 4.3 in [24]).
Via the natural isomorphism ξ : b Ñ d we can define elements v d w P V d W ,
vdw :“ ξV,W pvbwq, for v P V and w P W . Given elements u P U , v P V and w P W ,
the identity pu d vq d w “ u d pv d wq holds because of pU d V q d W “ U d pV d W q.
There is a standard symmetric braiding βV,W : V b W Ñ W b V on Vect for
all V, W P ObpVectq (with respect to the standard tensor product b). By defining
´1
bV,W “ ξW,V ˝ βV,W ˝ ξV,W
we obtain a symmetric braiding with respect to d. All
in all, the following proposition holds.
Proposition 2.1. The data pVect, d, R, bq define a symmetric strict monoidal
category.
For the rest of this paper, we will use the Schauenburg tensor product on Vect;
thus, we will from now on write b instead of d.
3. The chromatic Brauer category and its linear representations
In this section, we first provide some background on compact closed categories
(see Section 3.1), and then introduce the chromatic Brauer category as the certain
quotient of a free strict compact closed category (see Section 3.2).
3.1. Compact closed categories. Let pC, b, I, α, λ, ρ, bq be a symmetric monoidal
category. An object X P ObpCq is called dualizable if there exists a triple pX ‹ , iX , eX q
consisting of an object X ‹ P ObpCq, called a dual of X, and morphisms iX : I Ñ
X b X ‹ and eX : X ‹ b X Ñ I, called unit and counit respectively, such that the
“triangular equations”

hold. A compact closed category is a symmetric monoidal category in which every
object is dualizable. We use the notation pC, b, I, α, λ, ρ, b, pq‹ , i, eq to include as
data the assignment pq‹ : X ÞÑ X ‹ , as well as the families i and e of unit morphisms
and counit morphisms, respectively. As explained in Section 6 of [15], the axioms
of a compact closed category determine three canonical isomorphism uX,Y : pX b
Y q‹ Ñ Y ‹ b X ‹ , v : I ‹ Ñ I, and wX : X ‹‹ Ñ X for all objects X, Y in C which are
uniquely determined by certain commutative diagrams. Following Section 9 of [15],
We call a compact closed category monoidally strict if the underlying monoidal
category is strict. Furthermore, we call a compact closed category strict if it is
monoidally strict, and, in addition, the families of isomorphisms u, v, w described
above are all identity morphisms.
In [15], Kelly and Laplaza give an explicit description of the free compact closed
category F A on a given category A, thus solving the coherence problem for this
structure. In Section 9 of [15], they discuss some related structures including the free

8

L.F. MÜLLER AND D.J. WRAZIDLO

monoidally strict compact closed category F 1 A, as well as the free strict compact
closed category F 2 A on A. The latter category is relevant for the present paper,
and has the following description in terms of generators and relations.
Theorem 3.1 ([15]). For any category A, the free strict compact closed category
F 2 A has as objects the tensor products X1 b ¨ ¨ ¨ b Xn , n ě 0, where each Xi is A
or A‹ for some object A of A. Moreover, F 2 A is a strict compact closed category
which is generated (as strict monoidal category) by the families of morphisms of its
symmetric braiding b, its unit i, its counit e, and the morphisms of A (considered
as morphisms in F 2 A), and by the following relations:
(R1) Naturality of b: For all morphisms f : X Ñ Y and all objects Z in F 2 A,
bY,Z ˝ pf b 1Z q “ p1Z b f q ˝ bX,Z ,
bZ,Y ˝ p1Z b f q “ pf b 1Z q ˝ bZ,X .
(R2) Coherence relations for b: For all objects X, Y, Z in F 2 A,

(inverse law).

(R3) Triangular equations for i and e: For all objects X in F 2 A,
p1X ‹ b iX ‹ q ˝ peX ‹ b 1X ‹ q “ 1X ‹ ,
p1X b eX q ˝ piX b 1X q “ 1X .

iI “ 1I

(see diagram (6.3) in [15]),

bX,X ‹ ˝ iX “ iX ‹

(see diagram (6.4) in [15]).

3.2. The chromatic Brauer category. The Brauer category Br is considered in
Section 10 of [3] and Section 2.3 of [4], where Banagl defines it as a natural (horizontal) categorification of Brauer algebras. Roughly speaking, isomorphism classes of
finite sets serve as objects, and morphisms are isotopy classes of unoriented tangles
in Euclidean 4-space. We shall next introduce the chromatic Brauer category cBr
as a certain enrichment of the Brauer category. Namely, we equip the components
of objects and morphisms with colorings using a countable number of colors (see
Remark 3.3). However, we shal first give a more sophisticated definition of cBr in
terms of the free strict compact closed category assigned to the discrete category
N with ObpNq “ tpkq; k P Nu a countable set indexed by the natural numbers.
Definition 3.2 (chromatic Brauer category). The category cBr is the quotient
of the free strict compact closed category F 2 N (see Theorem 3.1) by the relation

and cBr is generated (as strict monoidal category) by the families of morphisms of
its symmetric braiding b, its unit i, and its counit e, and by the following relations:
(C1) Naturality of b: For all morphisms f : X Ñ Y and all objects Z in cBr,
bY,Z ˝ pf b 1Z q “ p1Z b f q ˝ bX,Z ,
bZ,Y ˝ p1Z b f q “ pf b 1Z q ˝ bZ,X .

iXbY “ p1X b iY b 1X ‹ q ˝ iX ,
iI “ 1I ,
bX,X ‹ ˝ iX “ iX ‹ .
For an object in ObpcBrq of the form (3.1), we introduce the alternative notation
prms, cq, where rms denotes the set t1, . . . , mu (with r0s “ H), and c : rms Ñ N is
the map given by cpiq “ ki . If cpiq “ k for all i, then we write c “ k. In later
sections, we will mainly use the notation prms, cq for objects in cBr because of its
consistency with the notation rms used for objects in the Brauer category Br in
[3, 4].
The elementary morphisms bpkq,plq , ipkq , and epkq , k, l P N, play an important role
in the study of cBr, as the following remarks show.
Remark 3.3 (visualizing morphisms of cBr). Similar to the discussion of morphisms
of the Brauer category considered in [3, 4], morphisms of cBr can be thought of as
being ambient isotopy classes of 1-dimensional unoriented tangles in a high dimensional Euclidean space with the novelty that each component is now labeled by an
object of N. By projecting the tangles into a plane, we can visualize morphisms

10

of cBr by deformation classes of diagrams like in Figure 1, where differently structured lines correspond to independent labels. We can use these diagrams to encode
a decomposition of a morphism of cBr into elementary morphisms as follows. Horizontal lines in such a diagram represent identity morphisms, crossings represent
elementary braidings bpkq,plq , and left and right half circles represent elementary
units ipkq and counits epkq , respectively. Moreover, composition of morphisms in
cBr corresponds to horizontal composition of diagrams, and tensor product of
morphisms in cBr is defined by vertical “stacking” of diagrams.
Remark 3.4 (generators and relations of cBr). It follows from the relations bX,Y bZ “
p1Y b bX,Z q ˝ pbX,Y b 1Z q (C2) and iXbY “ p1X b iY b 1X ‹ q ˝ iX (C4) (and the
analogous relation for the counit e) that we can take the elementary morphisms
bpkq,plq , ipkq , and epkq for k, l P N as generators of cBr. Then, it can be shown that
the following relations are sufficient to generate cBr as strict monoidal category
(also compare with Theorem 2.6 in [18]):

3.3. Linear representations of the chromatic Brauer category. For the purpose of constructing symmetric strict monoidal functors Y : cBr Ñ Vect, where
Vect is equipped with the Schauenburg tensor product (see Section 2.2), we use the
notion of a duality structure on a finite dimensional real vector space V . Namely, a
duality structure on V is a pair pi, eq whose components are a symmetric copairing

i : R Ñ V b V and a symmetric pairing e : V b V Ñ R, also called unit and counit,
respectively, satisfying the zig-zag equation pe b 1V q˝ p1V b iq “ 1V . In other words,
V is dualizable with dual V , and is hence self-dual.
Let d be the dimension of V , and let tv1 , ..., vd u be a basis of V . Then, the set
of all duality structures on V is in 1-1 correspondence to the set of symmetric and
invertible pd ˆ dq-matrices Sympd, Rq X GLpd, Rq. Indeed, let ejk “ epvj b vk q, and
set X “ Matpeq “ pejk qdj,k“1 . Then, X is symmetric due to the symmetry of e, and
– by the zig-zag equation – X is invertible with inverse X ´1 “ Matpiq “ pijk qdj,k“1 ,
řd
Conversely,
where the coefficients ijk are given by ip1q “
j,k“1 ijk vj b vk .
let X P Sympd, Rq X GLpd, Rq be symmetric and invertible. Then, the matrices
vecpX ´1 q and vecpXqT define a symmetric copairing and pairing such that the zigzag equation is satisfied, where p´qT denotes the transposition of a matrix, and
vecp´q denotes the vectorization of a matrix formed by stacking the columns of the
matrix into a single column vector.
For a linear representation Y : cBr Ñ Vect of cBr, the pair pY pipkq q, Y pepkq qq
forms a duality structure on Vk . Hence, Y ppkqq “ Vk is for all k P N a finite
dimensional vector space (cf. Proposition 2.7 in [4]). Since Y is symmetric, we also
have Y pbpkq,plq q “ bVk ,Vl , where bVk ,Vl : Vk bVl Ñ Vl bVk is the braiding isomorphism
in Vect, which is induced by vk b vl ÞÑ vl b vk . Conversely, the following result
shows that we may construct symmetric strict monoidal functors Y : cBr Ñ Vect
by choosing duality structures.

Theorem 3.5 (Linear representations of cBr). Let Vk be a finite dimensional real
vector space and let the pair pipkq , epkq q be a duality structure on Vk for all k P N.
Then there exists a unique symmetric strict monoidal functor Y : pcBr, b, I, bq Ñ
pVect, b, R, bq, which satisfies Y ppkqq “ Vk and preserves duality, i.e. Y pipkq q “
ipkq and Y pepkq q “ epkq for all k P N.

Proof. On object level, the values of Y are uniquely and unambiguously determined
by the requirement that Y ppkqq “ Vk for all k P N because the objects of cBr are
just the finite tensor products of objects of the form pkq, and Y has to respect the
monoidal structure. (In particular, we have Y pIq “ R.)
By Remark 3.4, cBr is generated by the elementary morphisms epkq ipkq and
bpkq,plq . Thus, the values of Y on morphisms are uniquely determined by the requirements Y pipkq q “ ipkq and Y pepkq q “ epkq for all k P N, and by the requirement
Y pbpkq,plq q “ bVk ,Vl , k, l P N, of being a symmetric monoidal functor. To show
that Y is unambiguously defined on morphisms, we have to verify that the relations (C1) to (C4) of Definition 3.2 are valid in Vect after applying Y to every
elementary morphism and every identity morphism in these relations. In view of
Remark 3.4, we can instead verify the relations (A1) to (A5) as follows. The zigzag relation (A1) is satisfied by the definition of the duality structure. To verify
plq
pkq

relation (A2), we fix a bases tv1 , ..., vdk u and tv1 , ..., vdl u of the finite dimensional vector spaces Vk and Vl , respectively. Then, the desired relation follows by

Relation (A3) is satisfied because i is a symmetric copairing. Moreover, the transposition b clearly satisfies relation (A4). Finally, b is a well-known solution of the
Yang-Baxter equation so that relation (A5) is satisfied as well.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.2
The proof of Theorem 1.2 presented here is based on the proof of Theorem 1.1
given in Chapter 5 of [20]. It is divided into two parts as follows. The first part
culminates in Corollary 4.4, which states that the given symmetric strict monoidal
functor Y : cBr Ñ Vect is faithful if and only if it is faithful on loops (a notion that
will be defined below). As it turns out, Corollary 4.4 is a consequence of Proposition 4.2, which takes place solely in the chromatic Brauer category. Secondly, we
prove Theorem 4.5 which classifies all symmetric strict monoidal functors Y which
are faithful on loops.
For k P N, we define the k-loop λpkq “ epkq ˝ipkq , which is an endomorphism of the
identity object I P ObpcBrq. We call a morphism ϕ : prms, cq Ñ prm1 s, c1 q in cBr
loop-free if there is no morphism ϕ0 : prms, cq Ñ prm1 s, c1 q such that ϕ “ λpkq b ϕ0
for some k P N. Then, we obtain the following normal form for morphisms in cBr.
Lemma 4.1. Any morphism
ϕ : prms, cq Ñ prm1 s, c1 q in cBr can be written for

cBr, and ϕ0 : prms, c0 q Ñ prm1 s, c10 q is a loop-free
morphism in cBr that can be

and satisfy |c´1

We introduce some operations ϕop , o ϕ and ϕo on morphisms ϕ : prms, cq Ñ
prm1 s, c1 q in cBr as follows. Define ϕop by

(4.1)
eprm1 s,c1 q b 1prms,cq ˝ 1prm1 s,c1 q b ϕ b 1prms,c1 q ˝ 1prm1 s,c1 q b iprms,cq .
Using the triangular equations (C3) one can equivalently define ϕop by
˘

˘ `
`
1prms,cq b eprm1 s,c1 q ˝ 1prms,cq b ϕ b 1prm1 s,c1 q ˝ iprms,cq b 1prm1 s,c1 q .

Intuitively, ϕop can be obtained from ϕ by reflecting a diagram as considered in Remark 3.3 along a vertical axis. Note, that for isomorphisms α : prms, cq Ñ prms, c1 q

and epkq “ ipkq . Furthermore, we define ϕ : prms, cq b prm s, c q Ñ pr0s, cH q and
ϕo : pr0s, cHq Ñ prms, cq b prm1 s, c1 q by o ϕ :“ eprms,cq ˝ p1prms,cq b ϕop q and ϕo :“

Proposition 4.2. Let ϕ, ψ : prms, cq Ñ prm1 s, c1 q be loop-free morphisms in cBr.
Then ϕ “ ψ if and only if

Conversely, let ϕ, ψ : prms, cq Ñ prm1 s, c1 q be two morphisms satisfying (4.2).
Considering o ϕ and ψ o as being represented by embedded tangles in r0, 1s ˆ R3
(compare Remark 3.3) denoted by W po ϕq and W pψ o q, respectively, it suffices to
show that for every component C of W pa ϕ0 q there exists a component C of W pψ0a q
such that C and C have the same endpoints in rm`m1 s. Let P be a point in rm`m1 s
and let Pϕ and Pψ denote the other endpoint of the connected component C and C,
respectively, containing P . Note first, that the number 12 pm ` m1 q is the maximal
number of loops tλpkq | k P Nu which can be contained in a ϕ0 ˝ ψ0a , since W pψ0a q
and W pa ϕ0 q each consist of 12 pm ` m1 q distinguished connected components. This
means that for every component C of W pa ϕ0 q there is a component C of W pψ0a q
such that C and C close up to S 1 . In other words, if P P C and P P C, then
Pϕ “ Pψ .

Let us now consider the given symmetric strict monoidal functor Y : cBr Ñ
Vect. Recall from the discussion in Section 3.3 that Y ppr1s, kqq “ Vk is for all
k P N a finite dimensional vector space, whose dimension will be denoted by dk .
By assumption, dk ą 0 for all k.
Lemma 4.3. For all k P N we have Y pλpkq q “ dk pą 0q.
Proof. By Proposition 2.9 in [4], the “trace formula” e ˝ i “ dk holds for any
duality structure pi, eq on Vk . In particular, this applies to the duality structure
pY pipkq q, Y pepkq qq, and we have Y pλpkq q “ Y pepkq q ˝ Y pipkq q.

The symmetric strict monoidal functor Y : cBr Ñ Vect is called faithful on

As an immediate consequence of Proposition 4.2 we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 4.4. Y : cBr Ñ Vect is faithful on loops if and only if Y is faithful.
Proof. Let ϕ0 , ψ0 : prms, cq Ñ prms, c1 q be loop-free such that Y pϕ0 q “ Y pψ0 q. We
need to show that ϕ “ ψ. Since Y pϕq “ Y pψq, we have Y pϕo0 q “ Y pψ0o q. Therefore,

This completes the proof of Theorem 1.2.
Remark 4.6 (an alternative proof). Based on Section 3.2 in [27], we have an alternative proof of Theorem 4.5 which does not make use of a trace argument, but
exploits the Kronecker product of matrices instead.
5. Positive TFTs, fold maps, and exotic Kervaire spheres
Banagl [3, 4] has employed the Brauer category Br as well as singularity theory of
fold maps to construct a high-dimensional positive TFT which is defined on smooth
cobordisms. As an application, he has shown that the state sum of his theory
can distinguish exotic smooth structures on spheres from the standard smooth
structure. Banagl’s construction is sketched in Section 10 of [3] as an explicit
example of the general framework of positive TFTs, and has been implemented in
full detail in [4]. In the present section, we construct a refinement of Banagl’s theory
in which we replace the Brauer category Br by its chromatic enrichment cBr. Our
Theorem 5.8 will illustrate the power of our state sum invariant by showing that the
associated aggregate invariant can detect exotic Kervaire spheres in infinitely many
dimensions. On the other hand, we point out that the gluing axiom of positive
TFTs ensures that our state sum invariant is computable by chopping cobordisms
into pieces and computing their state sum invariants.

THE CHROMATIC BRAUER CATEGORY AND ITS LINEAR REPRESENTATIONS

17

The present section is structured as follows. In Section 5.1, we outline the features of Banagl’s general framework of positive TFTs, and explain the abstract process of quantization within the framework. Next, Section 5.2 provides the concrete
definitions of fold fields and the cBr-valued action functional. In particular, we
point out the changes that arise from using the chromatic Brauer category instead
of Br. Then, quantization of our data is discussed in Section 5.3, where we indicate
carefully the necessary modifications in the algebraic process of so-called profinite
idempotent completion. Finally, in Section 5.4, we define the aggregate invariant
of homotopy spheres, and sketch our application to exotic Kervaire spheres.
5.1. General framework. In [3], Banagl presents a new approach to the construction of certain TFTs in arbitrary dimension. The basic idea is to modify Atiyah’s
original axioms [1] by formulating them over semirings instead of rings. Compared
to a ring, a semiring is not required to have additive inverses, i.e. “negative” elements. As a result, Banagl coins the notion of positive TFTs. He shows that
any system of so-called fields and action functionals gives rise to a positive TFT
by means of a process he calls quantization in analogy with theoretical physics.
In order to avoid set theoretic difficulties that may arise in the definition of the
Feynman path integral, Banagl employs the concept of complete semirings due to
Eilenberg [7]. The reason is that a complete semiring has a summation law that
allows to sum families of elements indexed by arbitrary index sets. Positive TFTs
can motivate the construction of new invariants for smooth manifolds. For example,
Banagl defines the aggregate invariant of homotopy spheres (see Section 10 in [4]).
In the following, we outline Banagl’s construction of a n-dimensional positive
TFT from given systems of fields and action functionals via the process of quantization (see Sections 4 to 6 in [3]).
By definition, a system F of fields assigns to every closed pn ´ 1q-manifold M
and to every n-cobordism W sets of fields F pM q and F pW q, respectively, such that
certain properties hold. Fields on a cobordism can be restricted to subcobordisms
and to codimension 1 submanifolds. Moreover, fields behave in a desirable way with
respect to the action of homeomorphisms and disjoint union. Last but not least,
fields are requested to glue under the gluing of cobordisms. Next, we consider a
system T of action functionals (or action exponentials) on fields F with values in a
fixed strict monoidal category C. In Section 5.2, we will specifically take C “ cBr.
The notion of action functional is inspired by the exponential of the action that
appears in the integrand of the Feynman path integral, and satisfies the following
axioms. To every n-cobordism W one associates a map TW : F pW q Ñ MorpCq
in such a way that disjoint union of cobordisms is reflected by tensor product of
morphisms in C, and gluing of cobordisms is reflected by composition of morphisms
in C. More precisely, one requires that TW pf q “ TW 1 pf |W 1 q b TW 2 pf |W 2 q for
fields f on the disjoint union W “ W 1 \ W 2 of cobordisms W 1 and W 2 , and
TW pf q “ TV pf |V q ˝ TU pf |U q for fields f on the gluing W “ U YN V along N
of cobordisms U from M to N and V from N to P . Furthermore, the action
functional is invariant under the action of homeomorphisms. Eventually, let us
describe the process of quantization. For this purpose, we fix a system F of fields,
a C-valued system T of action functionals on the fields, and a complete semiring
S. Following Section 4 in [3], one first constructs a complete additive monoid
Q “ QS pCq from the semiring S and the strict monoidal category C. The elements

18

L.F. MÜLLER AND D.J. WRAZIDLO

of Q are just maps MorpCq Ñ S. Then, one exploits the completeness of S to
define two different multiplications on Q. As a result, one obtains a pair pQc , Qm q
of generally non-commutative complete semirings. Multiplication in Qc is based
on the composition of morphisms in C, whereas multiplication in Qm exploits the
monoidal structure of C. Next, as explained in Section 6 of [3], one assigns to every
n-cobordism W the composition TW : F pW q Ñ Q of TW : F pW q Ñ MorpCq with
the map MorpCq Ñ Q that assigns to every morphism γ in C its characteristic
function χγ . Finally, the state sum ZW : F pBW q Ñ Q is defined on a boundary
condition f P F pBW q as
ÿ
ZW pf q “
TW pF q P Q,
F PF pW,f q

where the sum ranges over all fields F on W that extend f , i.e., F |BW “ f . We
note that ZW is well-defined due to the completeness of Q. In analogy with the
quantum Hilbert state from physics, the state module ZpM q of a closed n-manifold
M consists of all maps (“states”) F pM q Ñ Q that satisfy a certain constraint
equation. It can be shown that ZW satisfies the constraint equation and is thus
an element of the state module ZpBW q. Furthermore, the state modules and state
sums thus defined can be shown to satisfy Banagl’s axioms of a positive TFT,
including the essential gluing axiom. For a topologically meaningful choice of fields
and action functionals the state sum ZW provides an invariant of n-cobordisms W
that is interesting for further investigation.
5.2. Fold fields and cBr-valued actions. Fix an integer n ě 2. In this section,
we specify the fields and actions that will determine our modification of the ndimensional positive TFT constructed in [4]. All manifolds considered (with or
without boundary) will be smooth, that is, differentiable of class C 8 .
5.2.1. Cobordisms. We recall from Section 7.1 of [4] the terminology concerning
manifolds and cobordisms.
From now on, we use the notation M , N , P etc. for closed pn ´ 1q-dimensional
manifolds. Fix an integer D ě 2n ` 1. We will always assume that any M is
smoothly embedded in RD , and that every connected component of M is contained
in a hyperplane of the form tku ˆ RD´1 for some k P t0, 1, 2, . . . u.
Definition 5.1. A cobordism from M to N is a compact n-dimensional smoothly
embedded manifold W Ă r0, 1s ˆ RD with the following properties:
(1) the boundary of W is BW “ M \ N , where M Ă RD “ t0u ˆ RD is the
ingoing boundary and N Ă RD “ t1u ˆ RD is the outgoing boundary,
(2) the interior of W satisfies W zBW Ă p0, 1q ˆ RD ,
(3) there exists 0 ă ε ă 12 such that W X r0, εs ˆ RD “ r0, εs ˆ M and W X
r1 ´ ε, 1s ˆ RD “ r1 ´ ε, 1s ˆ N are product embeddings (any such ε is
referred to as a cylinder scale), and
(4) every connected component of W is contained in a set of the form r0, 1s ˆ
tku ˆ RD´1 for some k P t0, 1, 2, . . . u.
The advantage of working with embedded cobordisms W Ă r0, 1s ˆ RD is that
every such cobordism is naturally equipped with a time function ω : W Ñ r0, 1s
given by the restriction of the projection r0, 1s ˆ RD Ñ r0, 1s to W . For every
regular value t P r0, 1s of the time function ω : W Ñ r0, 1s the preimage ω ´1 ptq is a
smoothly embedded codimension 1 submanifold of W .

5.2.2. System of fold fields. Our theory will use exactly the same definition of fold
fields on n-cobordisms that is used by Banagl in the original construction. Thus,
in this section we will outline the content of Section 7.2 of [4]. We also use the
same sets of fields on closed pn ´ 1q-manifolds although their definition relies on
our modified action functional (see the end of Section 5.2.3).
The construction of fold fields on an n-dimensional cobordism W is based on the
notion of fold maps from W into the plane R2 – C. By definition, a fold map of an
n-manifold X without boundary into the plane is a smooth map F : X Ñ R2 such
that for every point x P X there exist coordinate charts centered at x and F pxq in
which F takes one of the following two normal forms:

(regular point of F ),

(fold point of F ).
t, ´x1 ´ ¨ ¨ ¨ ´ xi ` xi`1 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ ` xn´1

Let SpF q denote the set of fold points of a fold map F : X Ñ R2 . It can be shown
that SpF q Ă X is a smoothly embedded 1-dimensional submanifold that is closed
as a subset, and that F restricts to an immersion SpF q Ñ R2 . In analogy with the
Morse index of non-degenerate critical points, there is the following notion of an
(absolute) index for fold points, which is a well-known application of the concept
of intrinsic derivative (see Section VI.3 in [9, p. 149ff]).
Proposition 5.2. To any fold map F : X Ñ R2 one can associate a well-defined
locally constant map
ιF : SpF q Ñ N,

ιF pxq “ minti, n ´ 1 ´ iu,

where i P t0, . . . , n ´ 1u is the number of minus signs that appear in the local normal
form of fold points (5.1).
Let W be an n-dimensional cobordism from M to N in the sense of Definition 5.1.
A smooth map F : W Ñ R2 is called fold map if F has for some ε ą 0 an extension
to a fold map
Fr : pp´ε, 0s ˆ M q Yt0uˆM W Yt1uˆN pr1, 1 ` εq ˆ N q Ñ R2 .

Given a fold map F : W Ñ R2 , the intersection SpFr q X W does not depend on
the choice of the fold map extension Fr , and will in the following be denoted by
SpF q. Furthermore, for an open subset U Ă BW we write SpF q&U if SpF̃ q&U for
some (and hence, any) fold map extension F̃ of F . If SpF q&BW , then SpF q Ă
W is a 1-dimensional smoothly embedded compact submanifold with boundary
BSpF q “ SpF q X BW . In this case, we write ιF : SpF q Ñ N for the restriction of
the absolute index ιFr : SpFr q Ñ N of Proposition 5.2 for some (and hence, any) fold
map extension F̃ of F . (The above notions can be shown to be independent of the
choice of Fr by using the characterization of fold maps in terms of transversality
given in Definition 4.1 in [9, p. 87].)
Let ω : W Ñ r0, 1s denote the time function associated to W (see Section 5.2.1).
Definition 5.3. Given a fold map F : W Ñ C, we set
(
&pF q “ t P r0, 1s ; t is a regular value of ω, and SpF q&ω ´1 ptq

Ă r0, 1s .

20

Definition 5.4. A fold map F : W Ñ C has generic imaginary parts over t P r0, 1s
if the restriction Im ˝F | : SpF q X ω ´1 ptq Ñ R is injective. Let
GenImpF q “ tt P r0, 1s ; F has generic imaginary parts over tu

Ă r0, 1s .

For k P t0, 1, 2, . . . u let F pkq denote the restriction of a fold map F : W Ñ C to
the part of W that lies in r0, 1s ˆ tku ˆ RD´1 (see Definition 5.1(4)):
F pkq “ F | : W X pr0, 1s ˆ tku ˆ RD´1 q Ñ C.
Finally, fields on W are fold maps F : W Ñ C with certain properties concerning
the subsets &pF pkqq and GenImpF pkqq of r0, 1s.
Definition 5.5 (Definition 7.9 in [4]). A fold field on W is a fold map F : W Ñ C
such that for all k P t0, 1, 2, . . . u the following conditions hold:
p1q 0, 1 P &pF pkqq X GenImpF pkqq, and
p2q GenImpF pkqq is residual in r0, 1s. (That is, GenImpF pkqq contains the
intersection of a countable family of dense open subsets of r0, 1s.)
Condition p1q is exploited in the construction of the Br-valued action functional
S in Section 7.3 of [4] (as well as in our modified construction in Section 5.2.3). Condition p2q is crucial for the proof of the indispensable gluing theorem (see Section
7.7 in [4]).
Let F pW q denote the set of all fold fields on W . If W “ H, then one puts
F pW q “ t˚u (set with a single element). Fields on closed pn ´ 1q-dimensional manifolds will be introduced at the end of the following Section 5.2.3, which completes
the definition of the system F of fields.
5.2.3. System of cBr-valued action functionals. Banagl exploits singularity theory
of fold maps into the plane to construct a system S of Br-valued action functionals
(see Section 7.3 in [4]). Namely, for every n-cobordism W he constructs a function
S : F pW q Ñ MorpBrq assigning to every fold field on W a morphism in Br that
encodes the combinatorial information of the 1-dimensional singular set of the fold
map. In the present section, we modify the original construction by replacing the
Brauer category Br with its chromatic enrichment cBr. The idea is to capture
not only the singular patterns provided by the singular sets of fold fields, but also
to remember the indices of fold lines by using labels from the set N. Hence, we
construct a system S of cBr-valued action functionals which is a lift of S under the
forgetful map MorpcBrq Ñ MorpBrq.
Let W be an n-cobordism from M to N . We construct the function S : F pW q Ñ
MorpcBrq as follows. If W is empty, then we set Sp˚q “ idpr0s,cH q . Next suppose
that W is non-empty and entirely contained in a set of the form r0, 1sˆ tku ˆ RD´1 ,
where k P t0, 1, 2, . . . u. Let F p“ F pkqq P F pW q be a field on W . By condition
(1) for fold fields (see Definition 5.5), we have 0, 1 P &pF q, so that the intersections
SpF q X M and SpF q X N are compact manifolds of dimension 0. Furthermore, since
F has generic imaginary parts over 0 and 1 (see Definition 5.4), the composition
Im ˝F : W Ñ R restricts to injective maps on both SpF q X M and SpF q X N . Let
m and m1 denote the number of points in SpF q X M and SpF q X N , respectively.
Then, we obtain orderings SpF q X M “ tp1 , . . . , pm u and SpF q X N “ tq1 , . . . , qm1 u
which are uniquely determined by requiring that pIm ˝F qppi q ă pIm ˝F qppj q if and
only if i ă j, and pIm ˝F qpqi q ă pIm ˝F qpqj q if and only if i ă j. The resulting
bijections SpF q X M – M rms, pi ÞÑ i, and SpF q X N – M rm1 s, qi ÞÑ i, are exactly

THE CHROMATIC BRAUER CATEGORY AND ITS LINEAR REPRESENTATIONS

21

the same as those described in the original construction of S. (Note that the
notation M rms “ rms is used to indicate that rms is considered as a 0-submanifold
of R1 .) We define maps c : rms Ñ N and c1 : rm1 s Ñ N by assigning to each point
x P rms “ M rms – SpF q X M and x1 P rm1 s “ M rm1 s – SpF q X N the index
of the fold map F at x and x1 , respectively (see Proposition 5.2). So far, we
have constructed objects prms , cq and prm1 s , c1 q in cBr. The desired morphism
SpF q : prms , cq Ñ prm1 s , c1 q in cBr is now represented in the sense of Remark 3.3
by the embedded tangle SpF q Ă r0, 1s ˆ R3 that is defined in exactly the same
manner as described in the construction of S, together with the labeling given
by ιF (see Proposition 5.2). That is, every component of SpF q with non-empty
boundary is embedded as a smooth arc that connects the corresponding points in
pt0u ˆ M rmsq Y pt1u ˆ M rm1 sq. (For components of SpF q without boundary one
may choose an arbitrary embedding into p0,Â1q ˆ R3 .) Finally, for an arbitrary
8
non-empty cobordism W , we define SpF q “ k“0 SpF pkqq. (Note that the tensor
product is actually finite because W is compact.) This completes our construction
of a system S of cBr-valued action functionals which lifts S under the forgetful map
MorpcBrq Ñ MorpBrq. Note that Lemma 7.12 in [4] remains valid when replacing
S with S in the formulation. That is, given a fold field F on W and some t P p0, 1q
such that t P &pF pkqq X GenImpF pkqq for all k P t0, 1, . . . u, F restricts to fold
fields Fďt on W X pr0, ts ˆ RD q and Fět on W X pr1 ´ t, 1s ˆ RD q, and we have
SpF q “ SpFďt q ˝ SpFět q in cBr.
Finally, fields on a closed pn ´ 1q-manifold M are defined to be certain fold fields
on the cylinder r0, 1s ˆ M Ă r0, 1s ˆ RD , i.e., the trivial cobordism from M to M .
Namely, when M is non-empty, we put
F pM q “ tf P F pr0, 1s ˆ M q; Spf q “ 1 P MorpcBrqu,
where 1 denotes some identity morphism in cBr. Note that a fold field f P F pr0, 1sˆ
M q satisfies Spf q “ 1 in cBr if and only if Spf q “ 1 in Br. If M “ H, then one
puts F pM q “ t˚u (set with a single element). Hence, the set of fields on closed
pn´1q-manifold remains unchanged when replacing S with S. In particular, Lemma
7.13 and Lemma 7.14 (additivity axiom) in [4] remain valid when replacing S with
our modified cBr-valued action functional S in the formulation.
5.2.4. Linearization. It can be advantageous to linearize a given category-valued
system of action functionals because linear categories are easier to handle as pointed
out in Section 8 of [3]. During the process of quantization in Section 5.3 below,
we will employ a linearization T of our system S of cBr-valued action functionals
from Section 5.2.3. Such a linearization T is a system of Vect-valued action functionals that is defined by means of a fixed linear representation Y : cBr Ñ Vect
by assigning to every n-cobordism W the composition
S

Y

TW : F pW q ÝÑ MorpcBrq ÝÑ MorpVectq.
Since the linear representation Y : cBr Ñ Vect can be chosen to be faithful due to
Theorem 1.2, there is no loss of informational content when working with the corresponding linearization of S. As a result, our theory yields a refinement of Banagl’s
aggregate invariant of homotopy spheres which will be studied in Section 5.4.
5.3. Quantization. The purpose of the present section is to apply the process
of quantization over the Boolean semiring S “ B (see Example 5.6 below) to the

22

L.F. MÜLLER AND D.J. WRAZIDLO

system F of fold fields of Section 5.2.2 and our system T of Vect-valued action
functionals on F (see Section 5.2.4) along Banagl’s general framework of positive
TFTs outlined in Section 5.1. Hence, we obtain a refinement of Banagl’s highdimensional positive TFT defined on smooth cobordisms. In Section 5.4, we will
study the associated aggregate invariant of homotopy spheres.
First of all, Section 5.3.1 below provides the necessary algebraic background
on semirings. In Section 5.3.2, we will modify the algebraic process of profinite
idempotent completion (see Section 6 in [4]) to represent loops of different colors
in cBr by a countable family of loop parameters. Finally, we proceed to define our
positive TFT Z in Section 5.3.3, where we will specify the state modules ZpM q of
closed pn´1q-manifolds M , and define the state sums of n-cobordisms W as certain
elements Z W P ZpBW q.
5.3.1. Semirings and semimodules. We collect here a number of concepts from the
theory of semirings and semimodules that are relevant for the process of quantization. For a detailed background, we refer to [7, 16, 23, 8, 11]. Our summary is
based on the presentations in Section 2 of [3] and Section 4 of [4].
Recall that a (commutative) monoid is a triple M “ pM, ˚, eq, where M is a
set equipped with a (commutative) associative binary operation ˚ and a two-sided
identity element e P M , that is, e ˚ m “ m ˚ e “ m for all m P M . A semiring
is a tuple S “ pS, `, ¨, 0, 1q, where S is a set together with two binary operations
` and ¨ and two elements 0, 1 P S such that pS, `, 0q is a commutative monoid,
pS, ¨, 1q is a monoid, the multiplication ¨ distributes over the addition from either
side, and 0 is absorbing, i.e. 0 ¨ s “ 0 “ s ¨ 0 for every s P S. The semiring S is called
commutative if the monoid pS, ¨, 1q is commutative. A morphism of semirings sends
0 to 0, 1 to 1 and respects addition and multiplication. Fix a semiring S. A (left)
S-semimodule is a commutative monoid M “ pM, `, 0M q together with a scalar
multiplication S ˆ M Ñ M , ps, mq Ñ sm, such that for all r, s P S, m, n P M , we
have prsqm “ rpsmq, rpm ` nq “ rm ` rn, pr ` sqm “ rm ` sm, 1m “ m, and
r0M “ 0M “ 0m. Given a morphism ϕ : S Ñ T of semirings, it is clear that T
becomes a S-semimodule via st “ ϕpsqt.
A monoid pM, ˚, eq is called idempotent if m ˚ m “ m for all elements m P M .
The semiring pS, `, ¨, 0, 1q is idempotent if pS, `, 0q is an idempotent monoid. A
semimodule is called idempotent if its underlying additive monoid is idempotent.
Next, we discuss the important notion of Eilenberg-completeness [7, p. 125] for
semirings and semimodules (see also [11, 16]). A complete monoid is a commutative
monoid pM, `, 0q together with an assignment Σ, called a summation law,
řwhich
assigns to every family pmi qiPI , indexed by an arbitrary set I, an element iPI mi
of M (called the sum of the mi ), such that

holds for every s P S and every family pmi qiPI in M . If ϕ : S Ñ T is a morphism of
semirings and T is complete as a semiring, then T can be easily seen to be complete
as an S-semimodule.
We will also need the following notion of continuity for idempotent complete
semirings (cf. [16, 23, 8, 11]). Here, we only state the definition, and refer to
the summary preceding Proposition 4.2 in [4] for more details. Observe that any
idempotent monoid pM, ˚, eq admits a natural partial order ď given by m ď m1 if
and only if m`m1 “ m1 . An idempotent complete monoidřpM, `, 0, Σq is continuous
if for all familiesřpmi qiPI , mi P M , and for all c P M , iPF mi ď c for all finite
F Ă I implies iPI mi ď c. An idempotent complete semiring (semimodule) is
called continuous if its underlying additive
ś monoid is continuous.
It is useful to note that the product iPI Mi of a family tMi uiPI of continuous
idempotent complete monoids is a continuous idempotent complete monoid.
Example 5.6. The minimal example of a semiring that is not a ring is given by the
Boolean semiring B. This is the set B “ t0, 1u equipped with addition defined by
1 ` 1 “ 1 and multiplication given by 0 ¨ 0 “ 0 (where 0 and 1 serve as identity
elements for addition and multiplication, respectively). Distributivity holds, but in
B there exists no additive inverse for 1. We leave it to the reader to check that the
commutative semiring B is idempotent, complete, and continuous.

5.3.2. Profinite idempotent completion. As mentioned before, our input data for
the process of quantization are the Boolean semiring S “ B (see Example 5.6),
the system F of fold fields (see Section 5.2.2), and our system T of Vect-valued
action functionals on F (see Section 5.2.4). Recall from Section 5.1 that the first
step of quantization consists in the construction of a pair pQc , Qm q of generally
non-commutative complete semirings. In principle, we could follow the general
construction provided in Section 4 of [3]. However, we would like to take care of
the additional structure given by the natural action of the polynomial semiring
of colored loops on the morphism sets of the chromatic Brauer category. As a
consequence, our state sum invariant will take values in power series in several
variables with matrix coefficients. Banagl has implemented this algebraic process
of profinite idempotent completion in Section 6 of [4] for the natural action of the
polynomial semiring of loops on the morphism sets of the Brauer category Br. Since
we work instead with the chromatic Brauer category cBr, we will in the following
discuss the modifications of Banagl’s construction in detail.
First, we give a brief outline of Banagl’s profinite idempotent completion. Note
that the sets HomBr prms, rm1 sq have the special property that they are naturally

24

L.F. MÜLLER AND D.J. WRAZIDLO

equipped with the action τ i ϕ “ ϕ b λbi of the (multiplicatively written) monoid
N “ tτ i ; i P Nu. Fix a linear representation U : Br Ñ Vect and write V “ U pr1sq
p “ U pλq P R. Then, the subset
and λ
Hm,n “ U pHomBr prms, rm1 sqq
1

of the real vector space HomVect pV bm , V bm q inherits an action of the monoid N
pi f . Given a set A, let F M pAq denote the free commutative monoid
via τ i f “ λ
generated by A. In particular, F M pHm,n q has the structure of a Nrτ s-semimodule
by Lemma 4.1 in [4]. A Nrτ s-semimodule is given by the algebraic tensor product
QpHm,n q “ F M pHm,n q bNrτ s Brrqss,
where Brrqss is the semiring of formal power series associated to the Boolean semiring B. In Lemma 6.7 in [4], it is shown that QpHm,n q is isomorphic as a Nrτ ssemimodule to a finite sum of copies of Brrqss, so that its elements consist of a
number of power series in the loop parameter q. (This fact can be derived more abstractly by using the concept of minimal shells of projectively finite subsets of a real
vector space, see Definition 6.1 in [4].) Finally, the profinite idempotent completion
of the set U pMorpBrqq is the Nrτ s-semimodule
ź
Q “ QpU q “
QpHm,n q.
m,m1 PN

Provided that the underlying functor U is chosen to be faithful on loops, the additive monoid pQ, `, 0q can be promoted to idempotent complete semirings Qc (the
composition semiring, see Proposition 6.12 in [4]) and Qm (the monoidal semiring,
see Proposition 6.14 in [4]). It can be shown that the semirings Qc and Qm are
both continuous (see Proposition 6.15 in [4]). Continuity is exploited in [4] to check
several axioms of positive TFTs, namely the behavior of state sums under disjoint
union (Proposition 7.22), and the gluing axiom (Theorem 7.26).

We proceed to explain how the process of profinite idempotent completion applies
to our setting. When using the chromatic Brauer category instead of Br, we need to
replace the semimodule Brrqss over Nrτ s by the semimodule Brrqss “ Brrq0 , q1 , . . . ss
over Nrts “ Nrτ0 , τ1 , . . . s. Here, the different parameters represent loops of different
labels in cBr. LetÀ
us introduce the semirings Nrτ s and Brrqss (compare Section 4
8
in [4]). Set N “
i“0 N, which is a commutative monoid with respect to component wise addition and identity element 0 “ p0, 0, . . . q. In general, a (formal)
power series in a countable number of indeterminates q “ q0 , q1 , . . . and with coefÑ B, written as a formal sum
ficients in the Boolean semiring B is a function a : Nś
ř
8
ν
ν
νs
νPN apνqq , where q denotes the (finite) product
s“0 qs . The element apνq is
ν
referred to as the coefficient of q . Let Brrqss be the set of all power series over
B having a countable number of indeterminates q “ q0 , q1 , . . . . We write 0 for the
power series a with apνq “ 0 for all ν, and 1 for the power series a with ap0q “ 1
and apνq “ 0 for all ν ‰ 0. Define an addition on power series by a ` b “ c, where
cpνq “ apνq ` bpνq for all ν. Define a multiplication
on power series by the Cauchy
ř
product, that is, a ¨ b “ c where cpνq “ µ`κ“ν apµqbpκq. Then, pBrrqss, `, ¨, 0, 1q
is a commutative idempotent semiring, the semiring of power series over B in a
countable number of indeterminates. In a similar way, using finite sums rather
than power series, one defines the polynomial semiring Nrts in a countable number of indeterminates t “ τ0 , τ1 , . . . . Note that Brrqss is a Nrts-semimodule via

THE CHROMATIC BRAUER CATEGORY AND ITS LINEAR REPRESENTATIONS

25

the semiring morphism Nrts Ñ Brrqss that extends the unique semiring morphism
N Ñ B by τk ÞÑ qk , k P N. It can be shown that Brrqss is a complete semiring,
and is hence complete as a Nrts-semimodule. Furthermore, the idempotent complete semiring Brrqss can be shown to be continuous. (Both claims follow easily
from the material of Section
ś5.3.1 by using that the monoidal structure of Brrqss is
isomorphic to the product νPN B.)
Returning to the category cBr, we observe that the k-loops λpkq , k P N, induce
an action of the (multiplicatively written) commutative monoid N “ ttν ; ν P Nu
on the morphism sets

Using the algebraic tensor product of semimodules over the commutative semiring
Nrts (see [13, 14], and compare Section 4 in [4]) we can now define a Nrts-semimodule
by
QpHprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q q “ F M pHprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q q bNrts Brrqss.
Let OPprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q denote the (finite) set of loop-free morphisms prms, cq Ñ
prm1 s, c1 q in cBr. From now on, we suppose that the linear representation Y : cBr Ñ
Vect is chosen to be faithful (see Section 5.2.4). Then, it can be shown that
QpHprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q q is isomorphic in the category of Nrts-semimodules to the product of copies of Brrqss indexed by the elements of OPprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q . In fact, in
analogy to Lemma 6.6 in [4], we have the following
Lemma 5.7. Every element in F M pHprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q q can be written as

and thus F M pHprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q q is a free Nrts-semimodule of rank r.

Finally, the profinite idempotent completion of the set Y pMorpcBrqq is the Nrτ ssemimodule

QpHprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q q.
prms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q

Being the product of copies of Brrqss, each QpHprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q q is a continuous
idempotent complete monoid. We conclude that the additive monoid pQ, `, 0q is
continuous, idempotent and complete as well. Hence, pQ, `, 0q can be advanced
c

to continuous idempotent complete semirings Q and Q in analogy with the construction in Section 6 in [4].
5.3.3. State modules and state sums. Let Q denote the profinite idempotent completion of the set Y pMorpcBrqq associated to a fixed faithful linear representation
Y : cBr Ñ Vect as constructed in Section 5.3.2. We proceed to define our smooth
positive TFT Z. The state module of a closed pn ´ 1q-manifold is defined to be
ZpM q “ tz : F pM q Ñ Qu. By Proposition 3.1 in [3], ZpM q inherits the structure of
c
c
a two-sided Q -semialgebra and a two-sided Q -semialgebra, and ZpM q is complete.
Then, it follows from the corresponding properties of Q that ZpM q is idempotent
and continuous. The construction of a contraction product

Let W n be a cobordism from M to N in the sense of Definition 5.1. The state
p
sum will be defined as an element Z W P ZpM qbZpN
q. Fix a cylinder scale εW for
W . Given a boundary condition pfM , fN q P F pM q ˆ F pN q, we define

F |r0,εpkqs«Mpkq « fM pkq, F |r1´ε1 pkq,1sˆN pkq « fN pkq, @ku,
where the equivalence relation « for fold fields on closed pn ´ 1q-manifolds X is
defined as follows. Two smooth maps f : ra, bsˆX Ñ C and f 1 : ra1 , b1 sˆX Ñ C are
equivalent, f « f 1 , if there exists a diffeomorphism ξ : ra, bs Ñ ra1 , b1 s with ξpaq “ a1
such that f pt, xq “ f 1 pξptq, xq for all pt, xq P ra, bs ˆ X (see Definition 7.18 in [4]).

which is a well-defined element of the complete semiring Q. Note that, when

with the element TW pF q b 1 P QpHprms,cq,prm1 s,c1 q q Ă Q.

In close analogy with the further steps in [4], one can prove that our assignment
Z is in fact a positive topological field theory. Namely, following Section 7.6 in [4],
one checks the correct behavior of our state sum under disjoint union. Moreover, following Section 7.7 in [4], one proves the essential gluing formula Z W “ xZ W 1 , Z W 2 y
(see Theorem 7.26 in [4]), where W is the result of gluing a cobordism W 1 from M
to N with a cobordism W 2 from N to P along N . Note that the preparatory results
Proposition 7.23, Lemma 7.24, and Proposition 7.25 in [4] need only be modified by
replacing the Br-valued action functional S with the cBr-valued action functional S
in the formulation. Diffeomorphism invariance ϕ˚ pZ W q “ Z W 1 (see Theorem 9.16
in [4]) of our state sum under diffeomorphisms ϕ : BW Ñ BW 1 that can be extended
to so-called time consistent diffeomorphisms ϕ : W Ñ W 1 can be shown along the
lines of Section 9 in [4]. In particular, Lemma 9.12 and Lemma 9.14 in [4] remain
valid when replacing S with S in the formulation. The map ϕ˚ : ZpBW q Ñ ZpBW 1 q
can then be defined on a function z : F pBW q Ñ Q and a field g P F pBW 1 q by
ϕ˚ pzqpgq “ zpg ˝ pidr0,1s ˆϕqq P Q.
5.4. The aggregate invariant and exotic Kervaire spheres. Positive TFTs
have been created by Banagl [3] with the intention to provide new topological
invariants for high-dimensional manifolds. In this section, we explain how our
positive TFT Z constructed in the previous section can be used to assign to every
homotopy sphere M its aggregate invariant ApM q, an element of the complete
semiring Q from Section 5.3.2. The construction of A is analogous to that of the
aggregate invariant A studied Section 10 in [4]. While the invariant A is known
to distinguish exotic spheres from the standard sphere (see Corollary 10.4 in [4]),
we will indicate briefly that the invariant A can distinguish exotic Kervaire spheres
from other exotic spheres in infinitely many dimensions.
Fix a closed pn ´ 1q-manifold M which is homeomorphic (but not necessarily
diffeomorphic) to the sphere S n´1 . Without loss of generality, we assume in the
following that S n´1 and M are smoothly embedded in t0u ˆ RD´1 (compare Section 5.2.1). From now on, we suppose that n ´ 1 ě 5. Then, it is well-known that
M admits Morse functions with exactly two non-degenerate critical points, namely
one minimum and one maximum. Given any diffeomorphism ξ : r0, 1s Ñ ra, bs with
ξp0q “ a, and any Morse function fM : M Ñ R with exactly two non-degenerate
critical points, we observe that the map
f M : r0, 1s ˆ M Ñ R2 ,

f M pt, xq “ pξptq, fM pxqq,

is a fold field on M (see Definition 5.5). Let C2 pM q Ă F pM q denote the (nonempty) subset of all such maps f M . Fix an element f S P C2 pS n´1 q of the form
f S “ idr0,1s ˆfS . Let us write CobpS n´1 , M q for the collection of all oriented
cobordisms from S n´1 to M that are embedded in r0, 1s ˆ t0u ˆ RD´1 (compare
property (4) of Definition 5.1). Since M is homeomorphic to S n´1 , it can be shown
that CobpS n´1 , M q is non-empty. (The proof, which exploits the fact that any
such M is parallelizable, is given in Lemma 10.1 in [4].) Now, for any cobordism W P CobpS n´1 , M q and any fold field f M P C2 pM q, the state sum Z W P
p
ZpS n´1 qbZpM
q of Section 5.3.3 can be evaluated at pf S , f M q P F pS n´1 q ˆ F pM q
to yield an element Z W pf S , f M q in the complete semiring Q from Section 5.3.2 that
is associated to a faithful linear representation Y : cBr Ñ Vect. Hence, summation

In conclusion, we outline an application to Kervaire spheres, which are a concrete
family of homotopy spheres that can be obtained from a plumbing construction as
follows (see [17, p. 162]). The unique Kervaire sphere Σn´1
of dimension n ´ 1 “
K
4r ` 1 can be defined as the boundary of the parallelizable p4r ` 2q-manifold given
by plumbing together two copies of the tangent disc bundle of S 2r`1 . According to
the classification theorem of homotopy spheres (see Theorem 6.1 in [19, pp. 123f]),
as well as recent work of Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel [10] on the Kervaire invariant one
problem, it is known that Σn´1
is an exotic sphere, i.e., homeomorphic but not
K
diffeomorphic to S n´1 , except when n ´ 1 P t5, 13, 29, 61, 125u.
Note that, according to Remark 6.3 in [29], there are infinitely many dimensions
of the form n ´ 1 ” 13 pmod 16q in which there exist exotic spheres that are not
diffeomorphic to the Kervaire sphere Σn´1
K . The following result shows that our
aggregate invariant A can distinguish exotic Kervaire spheres from other exotic
spheres in infinitely many dimensions. We give a sketch of the proof by referring
to the results of [27]. A detailed proof is beyond the scope of this paper, and will
appear elsewhere.
Theorem 5.8. Suppose that n ´ 1 ” 13 pmod 16q and n ´ 1 ě 237. Then, an
exotic pn ´ 1q-sphere Σn´1 is diffeomorphic to the Kervaire sphere if and only if
ApΣn´1 q “ ApΣn´1
K q.
Sketch of proof. Recall from Section 5.3.2 that elements of Q are families of power
series in Brrqss which are indexed by the loop-free morphisms of cBr. It follows
from the construction of the state sum Z W (see Section 5.3.3) that non-trivial power
series of the element ApM q P Q can only occur in the factor
QpHpr2s,0q,pr2s,0q q “ Brrqss ‘ Brrqss ‘ Brrqss,
where the three copies of Brrqss correspond to the three possible loop-free morphisms pr2s, 0q Ñ pr2s, 0q in cBr, namely 1pr2s,0q , bp0q,p0q , and ip0q ˝ ep0q . Let
ζpΣn´1 q P Brrqss denote the component of ApΣn´1 q that corresponds to the loopfree morphism ip0q ˝ ep0q Then, for every ν P N the coefficient of qν in ζpΣn´1 q is
nonzero if and
´
¯ only if there exists a fold field F P F pf S , f Σ q such that SpF q “
Â8
νk
k“0 λpkq b pip0q ˝ ep0q q. We choose ν such that νj “ 1 for j “ n{2 and νj “ 0
for j ‰ n{2. Then, it follows from Corollary 10.1.4 and Theorem 3.4.9 in [27] that
the coefficient of qν in ζpΣn´1 q is 1 whenever Σn´1 is diffeomorphic to Σn´1
K . Conversely, if Σn´1 is not diffeomorphic to Σn´1
,
then
Corollary
10.1.4
in
[27]
implies
K
that the coefficient of qν in ζpΣn´1 q is 0.
