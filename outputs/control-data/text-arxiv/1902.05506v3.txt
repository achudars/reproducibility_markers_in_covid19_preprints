Integration of electrical contacts into van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is critical for realizing electronic and
optoelectronic functionalities. However, to date no scalable methodology for gaining electrical access to buried
monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors exists. Here we report viable edge contact formation to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulated monolayer MoS2 . By combining reactive ion etching, in-situ Ar+ sputtering
and annealing, we achieve a relatively low edge contact resistance, high mobility (up to ∼30 cm2 V−1 s−1 ) and
high on-current density (>50 µA/µm at VDS = 3 V), comparable to top contacts. Furthermore, the atomically
smooth hBN environment also preserves the intrinsic MoS2 channel quality during fabrication, leading to a
steep subthreshold swing of 116 mV/dec with a negligible hysteresis. Hence, edge contacts are highly promising
for large-scale practical implementation of encapsulated heterostructure devices, especially those involving air
sensitive materials, and can be arbitrarily narrow, which opens the door to further shrinkage of 2D device footprint.

Two-dimensional electronic devices made from transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained prominence in recent years
for next-generation integrated electronics1 and nanophotonics
applications. In particular, MoS2 combined with other 2D materials
into vdW heterostructures, appears as an attractive candidate for
future transistor architectures2 , atomically thin p-n junctions and
tunnel diodes3 , memristors4 , high-efficiency photodetectors5 ,
light emitting diodes6 and novel valleytronic devices7 . Such
heterostructures are often assembled in a top-down manner by
picking-up discrete 2D material layers with a top hBN flake and
placing the resulting stack on a target substrate. Although the
presence of a top hBN layer on one hand serves to encapsulate the
constituent 2D materials in the heterostructure, at the same time
however, it also hinders the fabrication of direct electrical contacts
to the underlying layers. Despite vdW heterostructures having been
extensively investigated, a practical route for making electrical
contacts to them in a scalable manner is still lacking.

In TMDC heterostructures assembled without any encapsulation
layer, further limitations arise when electrical contacts are made in
a conventional top-contact geometry. In this scenario, the contact
electrodes come in direct physical contact with a TMDC layer
over a finite area. Since such a methodology inherently requires
performing lithography on unprotected TMDC layers, it exposes
them to foreign chemical species which are difficult to remove.
Additionally, bare TMDC surfaces in air are susceptible to O2
and H2 O adsorption8–10 . Owing to their atomically thin nature
however, mono- and few-layer TMDCs are quite sensitive to their
immediate environment which includes both surface adsorbates
from ambient exposure and processing residues. These act as
unintentional dopants leading to a spatially inhomogeneous carrier
density11 , which causes device-to-device variations in threshold
voltage12,13 and Schottky barrier height14 . Besides doping, surface
contaminants also scatter15 and trap charge carriers, thereby
resulting in reduced mobility, low on-current8–10 , increased flicker
noise16,17 , hysteresis18 and compromised optical properties19 .
Although measurements performed under high vacuum after
in-situ annealing have made it possible to observe the intrinsic
electrical transport properties of MoS2 20,21 , unencapsulated
devices measured in air show a drastic reduction in carrier mobility,
implying that even short-term air exposure is detrimental for monoand bi-layer MoS2 devices8,9 .
Therefore, for enabling a viable usage of TMDCs in integrated
electronics, better contact techniques are needed that allow for
encapsulation before contact patterning, in order to preserve the intrinsic material quality and achieve superior performance. Moreover,
encapsulation is also essential for long-term ambient stability since it

is well-known that most TMDCs, including MoS2 , MoSe2 and WS2
undergo gradual oxidation in air at room temperature22 , which leads
to further mobility degradation23 , morphological changes24,25 and
adversely affected photoluminescence26 . In fact, some 2D materials
like MoTe2 , HfSe2 , ZrSe2 , NbSe2 , black phosphorus and InSe, are
so unstable in air that surface deterioration can be detected within
a day25 . This restricts their assembly to an inert atmosphere27
and encapsulation in hBN is commonly employed to limit air
exposure23,27 . With such materials, lithographic contact fabrication prior to encapsulation is not only difficult but also impractical.

In order to circumvent the issue of making electrical contacts
to hBN-TMDC-hBN heterostructures, a common practice is to
embed additional layers of graphene23,28,29 or metallic NbSe2 30,31
within the stack to act as electrodes. Pre-patterning contact vias
into the top hBN before pick-up32,33 or transfer of pre-patterned
metal films onto TMDCs34 (or vice-versa) have also been reported.
However, alignment and transfer of multiple contact layers severely
increases the fabrication complexity, especially in multilayer
heterostructures, and becomes difficult to scale-up for practical
purposes. Moreover, in case of graphene, the contact resistance
(RC ) sensitively depends on the twist angle between the graphene
and TMDC layers which poses further alignment challenges35 .
Even though large-area chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of
lateral graphene-MoS2 heterostructures has made progress in recent
years36–38 , hard to control growth inhomogeneities38,39 as well
as ripples and strain induced by lattice mismatch still exist along
2D-2D edge interfaces40 , which could ultimately hinder fabrication
of very short channel (<100 nm) devices. Another possibility
is to fabricate tunneling contacts on encapsulated TMDCs41–44 .
However, such devices are restricted to very thin hBN (1-4L) or
oxide (∼2 nm)45 encapsulation layers for optimum carrier injection.
A more versatile approach is to etch through the top hBN layer in
order to expose an edge of any buried 2D material of interest and
form a one-dimensional (1D) ‘edge contact’ to it46,47 . Although
such a strategy has been highly successful for graphene46 , similar
attempts to make 1D edge contacts to monolayer (1L) MoS2 48,49
and few-layer WSe2 50 were met with limited success until now.
Here we report reliable edge contact formation to hBN encapsulated 1L-MoS2 . Our devices exhibit very low hysteresis together
with a high mobility and steep subthreshold swing, highlighting the
pristine interface quality achieved. By a systematic optimization
of the fabrication process, we obtain a moderately low contact
resistance and a high on-current (>50 µA/µm) with Ti-Au edge
contacts, despite a vanishingly small contact area. The contact
performance remains unchanged even at low temperatures, making
edge contacts promising for cryogenic experiments and applications.

the devices outlined in red, the MoS2 contact edges were not sputtered with Ar+ , to act as a control. Ar+ treatment results in a lower contact resistance, as
discussed later. The three sets of devices in h were aligned at 60° with respect to each other, in order to exclude any differences arising from the hexagonal
crystal symmetry of hBN and allow for a more accurate comparison. For all devices, L = 1 µm and the contact length Lc = 0.5 µm. Scale bars in c, h: 10 µm.

Thus, our work introduces a universal approach for making efficient
contacts to encapsulated 2D semiconductors, especially those
sensitive to air, and marks an important step towards pristine
devices with homogeneous electrical and optical characteristics on
a macroscopic scale. We believe that with further improvement of
the edge contact interface, by minimizing disorder and passivating
in-gap edge states, as discussed later, even smaller RC is achievable.

Edge contacts fabrication

We will now discuss the fabrication strategy that we developed.
Detailed process parameters can be found in Supporting Section
S1. Bottom hBN flakes were exfoliated directly on p+ Si/SiO2
(100 nm) substrates. 1L-MoS2 and top hBN flakes were separately
exfoliated on GelPak® PDMS (poly-dimethylsiloxane) stamps
and transferred sequentially onto a suitable bottom hBN flake,
as illustrated schematically in Figs. 1a, b. We found that PDMS
can leave substantial residues behind after transfer which we
minimized by pre-cleaning the PDMS surface in ultraviolet-ozone
(UV-O3 ) prior to exfoliation (see Ref. 51 for details). After each
transfer, the resulting stack was annealed at 200 ◦C in high-vacuum
for 3 h to release trapped bubbles, wrinkles and strain (if any)
induced by PDMS during transfer51 . Figure 1c shows the optical
image of a 1L-MoS2 flake transferred onto hBN from PDMS. To
fully encapsulate the MoS2 , another hBN flake was subsequently
transferred on top.

For device fabrication, bubble-free areas were chosen and
patterned into rectangular sections by e-beam lithography (EBL)
with PMMA (poly-methylmethacrylate) and reactive ion etching
(RIE). Contact trenches were defined in a second EBL step and
the exposed hBN-MoS2 -hBN was etched away by RIE to create
MoS2 edges for making contacts, as depicted in Fig. 1d (also see

Supporting Fig. S1). The samples were then loaded into an e-beam
evaporator for metal deposition, which we found to be the most
critical part of the whole fabrication process. An etched MoS2
edge consists of dangling bonds as well as defects like Mo- and
S-vacancies that are much more reactive than the basal plane of
MoS2 52 . During the time elapsed between etching and metal
deposition, O2 and H2 O molecules can not only bind to such edge
sites but also potentially convert unpassivated Mo into MoOx 52 .
However, MoOx , which is often used as a hole transport layer in
solar cells, hinders electron injection into MoS2 due to its high
work-function53 . This scenario is in strong contrast to top contacts
where MoOx formation is unlikely.
Hence, immediately before metal deposition, MoOx and any
adsorbed O2 or H2 O were removed by in-situ Ar+ sputtering at
±15° tilt angle to expose a fresh MoS2 edge (Fig. 1e). Tilting
the sample is necessary to access the etched hBN-MoS2 -hBN
sidewalls shadowed by an overhanging PMMA bilayer with an
inward slope and avoid re-deposition of sputtered PMMA over the
MoS2 edges. Ti-Au (5-40 nm) was then deposited at ±15° tilt under
a base pressure of 1 × 10−7 mbar (Fig. 1f-g). After lift-off, the
devices were annealed in Ar + H2 at 300 ◦C for 3 hrs to improve the
Ti-MoS2 edge interface and reduce contact resistance (Supporting
Section S2). Note that the use of Ti is essential for providing good
adhesion to hBN sidewalls. Without Ti, pure Au tends to reflow
and lose contact during annealing at 300 ◦C (Supporting Section
S4). The final set of devices with edge contacts are shown in Fig. 1h.

at the contacts, as predicted by our quantum transport simulations
(Supporting Section S6) and other computational studies55,56 . The
ID -VGS transfer characteristics of the same device are plotted in
Figs. 2b-c on linear and log scales, respectively. A high current
density reaching 53.5 µA/µm at VDS = 3 V with an on-off ratio
>107 can be observed. This clearly demonstrates that an efficient
carrier injection is achievable via edge contacts, despite the lack
of a 2D overlap between MoS2 and Ti. In Fig. 2c, each curve is
comprised of both forward and backward sweeps which display
a very small hysteresis. A magnified plot of the subthreshold
characteristics is shown in the inset of Fig. 2c and reveals a low
subthreshold swing (SS) of 116 mV/dec maintained up to nearly
4 orders of magnitude. Realization of such a steep slope and low
hysteresis was made possible here by encapsulation in hBN which
not only protects the MoS2 channel from processing residues,
but also provides an atomically smooth dielectric interface free
of dangling bonds and defects. This significantly decreases the
interface trap density in comparison with an exposed MoS2 layer
on a SiO2 substrate. Moreover, the absence of thermally populated
surface optical phonons in hBN at room temperature leads to a
reduced scattering rate and enhanced carrier mobilities in MoS2 57 .

where CG = 27.8 nF cm−2 is the gate capacitance per unit area and
Cit = q2 Dit is the interface capacitance per unit area, we estimated
the density of interface trap states Dit = 1.7 × 1011 eV−1 cm−2 .
This value is at least an order of magnitude lower than for
unencapsulated, lithographically exposed MoS2 on SiO2 59,60
and ZrO2 1 . Note that in this sample, the SS is primarily limited
by the back-gate dielectric thickness (100 nm SiO2 + 24 nm

hBN). From Eq. (1), it is evident that for a larger gate capacitance (thinner dielectric), a smaller SS approaching the room
temperature thermionic limit of ∼ 60 mV/dec is anticipated. The
ID -VGS characteristics of a second device on the same sample are
plotted in Fig. 2d, displaying a current density comparable to Fig. 2b.

To investigate the influence of the metal-MoS2 contact edge
cleanliness on carrier injection, a set of three control devices
that were not Ar+ sputtered, were also fabricated on the same
hBN-MoS2 -hBN stack shown in Fig. 1h (outlined in red). All
control devices conduct a significantly lower ID than in Figs. 2b-d,
indicating that carrier injection can be hindered if the MoS2
edge is not freshly cleaned immediately before metal deposition
(Supporting Section S5). Additionally, it has been reported that Ti
can partially oxidize during evaporation, depending on the vacuum
level inside the deposition chamber, and thereby result in TiOx
formation at the contact interface61 . To inhibit the oxidation of
Ti, we deposited Ti-Au on another set of devices (again without
Ar+ sputtering) at a 10x lower base pressure of ∼1 × 10−8 mbar,
with negligible residual O2 (Supporting Section S5). However, a
low ID is also observed in this case, revealing the existence of an
RC dominated transport. This implies that a better vacuum does
not lead to any appreciable change in the contact properties if Ar+
sputtering is not done. It must be emphasized that an optimum
post-deposition annealing temperature is also crucial for improving
the contact interface (Supporting Section S2). Hence, our key
finding here is that a clean MoS2 edge (before metallization) and
annealing (after metallization) are both essential for forming good
edge contacts, like those demonstrated in Figs. 2b-d. This likely
explains why such a high current density had not been observed
previously48,49 .
Next, we want to characterize the intrinsic carrier mobility
(µ0 ) and contact resistance (RC ) of our devices. For an ideal
long-channel nMOSFET operating in the strong inversion regime, a
linear dependence of ID on VGS is expected, given by
ID = µ0 CG

(V
− VT − VDS,int /2) VDS,int
L GS,int

(2)

where VT is the threshold voltage and the internal drain (VDS,int )
and gate (VGS,int ) voltages are equal to the externally applied
bias. Typically, µ0 is extracted from the slope of linear ID -VGS
characteristics with the help of Eq. (2). However, Fig. 2b shows that
ID grows sub-linearly with VGS for all VDS , which causes the mobility
extracted in this manner to be underestimated. For a more accurate
description of such ID -VGS behavior, the presence of finite contact
resistances RC in series with the MoS2 channel must be considered.
In this scenario, the internal voltages seen by the channel get
reduced to VDS,int = VDS − 2ID RC and VGS,int = VGS − ID RC . Note
that VT also gets modified to VT + δRC VGS but the drain-induced
barrier lowering (DIBL) factor δ is small enough to be neglected in
our long-channel devices. Equation (2) can then be re-written as

By plotting Y vs. VGS and using Eq. (6), the mobility (µ0 )
and threshold voltage (VT ) can be extracted from the slope (S1 )
and x-intercept, respectively13,64 . Figure 3a is a plot of the
Y -function for the data in Fig. 2b. It shows an approximately linear
behaviour in the strong inversion regime from which a value of
√
µ0 = 29.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be derived. Lastly, we plot 1/ gm
vs. VGS (Fig. 3b) and extract the slope (S2 ) of the linear region.
RC can then be determined from the relation RC = S2 VDS /2S1 ,
derived using Eqs. (4)–(6)65 . However, we found that due to
random undulations of the derivative ∂ID /∂VGS , the plots in
Fig. 3b do not always remain linear in the entire VGS − VT > VDS /2
range for every device. As a consequence, the extracted slope
can vary depending on the range chosen for the 1D polynomial
fit. Hence, for a more reliable estimation of device parameters,
we followed a slightly different approach and directly fitted
our ID -VGS curves with Eq. (4), choosing all three unknowns
(VT , θ and µ0 ) as fitting parameters. We found this procedure to
be more straightforward than the commonly used Y -function method.

Figure 3c is a reproduction of the plots in Fig. 2b, fitted with
Eq. (4) in the inversion regime for each VDS . The excellent
quality of the fits indicates that the model in Eq. (4) describes
our ID -VGS characteristics very well. The estimated mobility µ0 =
29.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 is also in good agreement with the value obtained
from the Y -function plots in Fig. 3a. Knowing µ0 and θ from the
fits, the contact resistance could then be deduced using Eq. (4)
to be RC ·W = 27.8, 11.7 and 8.3 kΩ·µm at VDS = 1, 2 and 3 V,
respectively. It was found to decrease with increasing VDS owing
to enhanced Schottky barrier tunneling at higher bias voltages,
as indicated by the non-linear ID -VDS characteristics in Fig. 2a.

Interestingly, these numbers are very similar to room temperature
RC values reported for graphene top contacts on hBN encapsulated
1L-MoS2 devices (20 kΩ·µm)28 as well as CVD grown lateral
graphene - MoS2 contacts (10-50 kΩ·µm)37,38 . But at the same time,
compared to the latter case, we observe a higher mobility owing to
hBN encapsulation. These results unambiguously demonstrate that
edge contacts can replace graphene contacts in encapsulated devices
and achieve better performance with a less restrictive and scalable
fabrication methodology. Moreover, use of graphene with MoS2 is
currently limited to electron injection only, whereas with a proper
choice of edge contact material, hole injection can also be feasible55 .
For completeness, it should be clarified that in our analysis RC is
assumed to be independent of VGS whereas in conventional contacts,
it decreases asymptotically with increasing carrier density for low
VGS near the onset of inversion, and slowly saturates at high VGS .
Such a behavior arises from the fact that in Ti-MoS2 top contacts
with an interfacial oxide (often unintentional), increasing VGS
reduces the sheet resistivity of MoS2 below the contact region and
also lowers the potential barrier for electron injection into MoS2 66 ,
which increases the effective current transfer length LT 67 . Moreover,
at the same time the applied VGS also pushes the conduction band
(CB) minimum closer to the metal Fermi level, thereby bending
the CB more steeply near the contact edge, which narrows the
effective Schottky barrier width67 . This two-fold mechanism leads
to a strong reduction of RC in top contacts as VGS increases68 .
However, in edge contacts where a 2D metal-MoS2 overlap region
is absent (LT ≈ 0), the primary mechanism behind RC reduction
with increasing VGS is Schottky barrier narrowing, being more
pronounced near the subthreshold region and saturating soon after.
This causes RC to show a gate dependence that is weak enough to
be neglected for VGS − VT  VDS /2, as substantiated by the constant
slopes S1 and S2 in Figs. 3a-b for VGS > 5 V, which justifies our
initial assumption. The model in Eq. (4) also fits well only in this
regime. Hence, the RC we estimated is the VGS independent value at
large carrier densities, similar to Ref. 64. The most accurate way
of extracting RC is the transfer length method (TLM). However,

it requires fabrication of several devices with decreasing channel
lengths and only works well when all devices have a very similar RC
and µ0 , such that a plot of total resistance vs. channel length follows
a straight line. This has turned out to be challenging at present for
our devices. Hence, we employed a simpler method, which gives a
reasonable estimate of RC and µ0 for every single device and also
helps in quantifying the device-to-device variability, unlike TLM.
Besides the device in Fig. 3c, we obtained similarly good
fits for ID -VGS curves measured from additional devices, which
further corroborates the model we used (see Supporting Section
S3 for more I-V datasets). From these fits, an average µ0 =
(20.5 ± 5.5) cm2 V−1 s−1 was found, where the error margin
represents one standard deviation. To study the influence of etched
hBN sidewall profiles on edge contacts, we tested two different hBN
etch recipes46,69 . Figures 3d-e are histograms of RC extracted from
devices etched using the two recipes. For SF6 + Ar etched devices,
we estimate an average RC ·W = (64.2 ± 9.6) kΩ·µm at VDS = |1 V|
(blue bars). Since our ID -VDS curves are slightly asymmetric in
general (Fig. 2a), we extracted RC values from ID -VGS fits for both
positive and negative VDS . Some devices were also measured at VDS
= |2 V| (orange bars) with an average RC ·W = (46 ± 10) kΩ·µm. In
contrast to SF6 + Ar etched devices, those etched with CHF3 + O2
show a wider distribution (Fig. 3e) and a higher mean value of
RC ·W = (73.5 ± 23.4) kΩ·µm. We attribute this increased variability
to greater etching inhomogeneity resulting from CHF3 + O2 in
comparison with SF6 + Ar, which we discovered upon scanning
electron microscopy of bare hBN sidewalls (Supporting Fig. S1).
We further characterized another edge contacted 1L-MoS2
device at low temperatures inside a liquid nitrogen filled cryostat
and is presented in Fig. 4. Apart from the expected shift in threshold
voltage VT to higher values58 , we find that the ID -VGS characteristics
as well as the edge contact resistance in Figs. 4a-b remain essentially
unchanged up to 120 K. This observed temperature insensitivity of
RC agrees very well with previous findings on 1D edge contacts
to graphene46 as well as CVD grown graphene edge contacts to
1L-MoS2 37 , and demonstrates that carrier injection into MoS2 via
edge contacts occurs efficiently even under cryogenic conditions.
Moreover, the ID -VDS characteristics at 122 K plotted in Fig. 4c,
behave similar to those at room temperature seen earlier for
the device in Fig. 2a. To shed some light on this behavior, we
performed ab initio quantum transport simulations following the
procedure described in our earlier publication66 and are discussed in
Supporting Section S6. In brief, the majority of the current injected
via Ti edge contacts into MoS2 does not come from thermionic
emission over the contact Schottky barrier, but rather tunneling
across the barrier. Since the electron transmission probability near
the Fermi level remains relatively constant as a function of energy
(Supporting Fig. S10), the tunneling current varies only weakly
with temperature. We found that this tendency persists for a range
of Schottky barrier heights that were evaluated.

Discussion and conclusions
Strictly speaking, the true bandstructure of a semiconductor
is defined for a lattice with an infinitely repeating unit cell. At
MoS2 edges and grain boundaries, dangling bonds and Mo-,
S-vacancies perturb the MoS2 bandstructure and give birth to
additional localized ‘edge states’ within the bandgap, as measured
experimentally11,70 . Such states were also observed in air-exposed
MoS2 11 and WSe2 71 devices, implying that adsorbed O2 and H2 O
do not fully passivate them. Passivation of dangling bonds and edge
states is essential for good edge contacts72 , which may be achieved
by Ti-MoS2 bonding. However, if a van der Waals gap or trapped
air molecules are present between the MoS2 edge and Ti, edge
state passivation could be hindered, resulting in a high density of
in-gap states at each electron injection site. By trapping incoming
electrons, these states can cause a space charge region to build up
which would repel further injected electrons. In this regard, in-situ
Ar+ sputtering plays a key role in producing a clean MoS2 edge
immediately before Ti deposition. Subsequent annealing at 300 ◦C
promotes atomic rearrangement and Ti-MoS2 bonding. The need
for such extra measures does not arise in the case of edge contacts
to graphene, where edge states (if any) are unable to trap carriers
because of the absence of a bandgap. Even O2 incorporation
at the graphene edge was shown to have a negligible effect46 ,
thus greatly simplifying fabrication of edge contacts to graphene.
This scenario is fundamentally different from top contacts where
the injected electrons do not encounter any edge states since the
translational symmetry of the underlying MoS2 lattice is not broken
(in the absence of interfacial reactions and defects) and on the
contrary, a vdW gap is beneficial for avoiding Fermi level pinning34 .
Interactions between the contact metal and MoS2 at the atomic
scale and structural characteristics of the contact interface play
a significant role in governing the performance of any contact.
For edge contacts in particular, where carrier transfer is restricted
to a single atomic edge, an optimum metal-MoS2 interface is
crucial. This makes them more challenging to fabricate compared
to top contacts which impose fewer constraints and can tolerate
local non-idealities to a greater extent due to the availability of a
finite area. Our main achievement here lies in the development of
an optimized process for realizing low resistance edge contacts
with a high density of current injection per atomic site. Further
studies are needed nevertheless to unravel the rich physics and
chemistry occurring at the contact interface. Atomically resolved
cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging
can be performed to gain better insights into the contact morphology,
interface quality and atomic configuration of edge contacts. This
would lead to a deeper understanding of the transport behavior
and provide valuable guidelines for further improvement of
the contact performance. It is possible that unpassivated edge
states at interface voids still undermine the performance of our
devices72 and also cause undesired Fermi level pinning73 . Suitable
chemical termination of dangling bonds could be a promising

6
strategy to passivate edge states, de-pin the metal Fermi level and
reduce RC even further. Apart from MoS2 , air sensitive TMDCs
like HfS2 , ZrS2 , etc. where edge states are expected to lie at
shallow levels close to the band extrema, which makes them more
immune to defects, appear as attractive materials for edge contacts74 .
It should be emphasized that even though ∼µm long Ti-Au54 ,
Ag-Au13 and In-Au75 top contacts on 1L-MoS2 have resulted
in a lower RC than that obtained in this work, in order to be fair,
a comparison should be made with top contacts scaled down to
sub-nm overlap lengths. However, it has been shown that the RC
begins to increase considerably for contact lengths smaller than the
current transfer length in both mono-67 and multi-layer MoS2 76 .
This implies that conventional contacts cannot be scaled down
beyond a certain limit, thereby restricting the minimum achievable
device footprint (gate length + 2 x contact length). To ensure
scaling of TMDC based devices, scalable contact geometries that
work efficiently irrespective of dimensions are necessary. This
bottleneck could be overcome by means of edge contacts, which do
not require a 2D overlap with TMDCs and thus, in principle, can be
made as narrow as possible. Another domain where edge contacts
can outperform top contacts is multilayer TMDCs, in which carrier
injection only via the topmost layer suffers from added interlayer
hopping resistances that limit the current transport to top few
layers77 , whereas with edge contacts, each layer can be individually
contacted for achieving higher current densities78 . In this regard,
1T-phase edge contacts to few layer MoS2 79 and MoTe2 80 also
seem to be an attractive choice, although inducing a 2H → 1T
phase transition under the contact regions after encapsulation can
be problematic.
Lastly, the possibility to encapsulate 2D materials before
processing with chemicals remains the biggest advantage of edge
contacts for building clean devices. Fundamental studies rely on
high interface quality and macroscopic homogeneity for uncovering
new physical phenomena, which can benefit from edge contacts
fabricated after encapsulation. Edge contacts are especially promising for 2D materials unstable in air for which fabrication of top
contacts is challenging due to restrictions imposed by encapsulation
inside an inert atmosphere before being exposed to air. Often
such heterostructures are built in a top-down manner and the need
to make contacts to buried layers demands pick-up of additional

graphene sheets. In such scenarios, edge contacts provide a much
higher flexibility in heterostructure assembly and can be scaled-up
to integrated circuits employing multiple metal layers separated by
insulating dielectric layers. Thus, we envision that edge contacts
will bring devices based on 2D materials one step closer to practical
implementation and open up new pathways in 2D materials research.

Fabrication details

hBN-MoS2 -hBN heterostructure assembly: Bottom hBN flakes were directly exfoliated on O2 plasma cleaned p+ Si/SiO2
(100 nm) substrates using a blue tape (Nitto). Naturally occurring MoS2 crystals (SPI Supplies) were exfoliated on viscoelastic
PDMS stamps (Gel-Film® PF-40-X4 sold by Gel-Pak® ). We found that PDMS often has a significant amount of uncrosslinked
(or ‘loosely bound’) dimethylsiloxane oligomers on its surface1 that can contaminate 2D materials exfoliated on PDMS2 . In
order to achieve high carrier mobilities and avoid unintentional doping, it is crucial to minimize PDMS residues and transfer
MoS2 in a pristine manner. Therefore, prior to MoS2 exfoliation, all PDMS stamps were treated with UV-O3 in a Bioforce
Nanosciences UV-ozone ProCleaner for 30 min (manufacturer specified illumination intensity: 14.76 mW/cm2 ), following the
procedure outlined in ref. 2. UV-O3 exposure breaks down unwanted surface oligomers and forms a residue free, few ∼ nm thin
SiOx layer on the PDMS surface3 . After UV-O3 treatment, PDMS stamps were left in ambient air for 2 h to deactivate the surface
termination and cause a partial hydrophobic recovery of the PDMS surface. This wait interval prevents bonding between PDMS
and the blue tape and helps to increase the yield during exfoliation.
Bulk MoS2 crystals were then exfoliated on the clean PDMS stamps after 2 h and monolayer flakes were identified in an optical
microscope. For transfer, PDMS stamps with MoS2 were placed on a transparent quartz plate and aligned on top of suitable
bottom hBN flakes on SiO2 using a SÜSS MicroTec MJB4 mask aligner. All transfers were carried out in air. Upon coming in
contact, the hBN-MoS2 stacks were heated to ∼65 ◦C for 2 min with a Peltier module kept underneath the Si/SiO2 substrates.
After allowing for a few minutes to cool down, the PDMS stamps were then slowly detached. The transferred MoS2 flakes on hBN
were annealed at 200 ◦C for 3 h in high vacuum (<1 × 10−5 mbar) to remove any remaining PDMS residues and release transfer
induced compressive strain as well as accumulated bubbles/wrinkles in MoS2 2 . The same procedure was followed to transfer the
top hBN flakes onto the MoS2 - (bottom) hBN stacks and the resulting heterostructures were again vacuum annealed at 200 ◦C for
3 h to reduce the density of bubbles.
Electron beam lithography (EBL) and etching: Clean, bubble-free areas in the hBN-MoS2 -hBN heterostructures were
chosen and patterned into well-defined rectangular channels by EBL (RAITH150 Two) with a bilayer of PMMA 50k (4% in
chlorobenzene) and 950k (4.5% in anisole). Each layer was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 45 s and baked at 180 ◦C for 4 min. After
EBL (electron dose: 400 µC/cm2 at 30 kV), PMMA was developed in MIBK:IPA (1:3) for 60 s and the exposed areas were
etched away by reactive ion etching (RIE) in an Oxford Plasmalab 80 Plus system. For making edge contacts into the rectangular
channels, EBL and RIE were repeated again. RIE was performed with either (a) CHF3 + O2 plasma (40 + 4 sccm, 50 W power
and 37.5 mTorr pressure, etch rate: ∼36 nm/min)4 or (b) SF6 + Ar plasma (20 + 20 sccm, 50 W power and 100 mTorr pressure,
etch rate: >90 nm/min)5 . Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the hBN surfaces resulting from the two etching recipes
are shown in Fig. S1 for comparison and reveal some striking differences. Reactive ion etching of hBN with CHF3 + O2 proceeds
primarily via chemical interactions that strongly favor etching along certain in-plane crystal directions. It can be noticed in Fig. S1a
that this highly anisotropic etch rate leaves behind a high density of hBN pyramids in the etched regions and forms sidewalls
with very narrow triangular crevices (red dotted lines). It is reasonable to assume that during metal deposition over such hBN
sidewalls, Ti grains might not fill these fine crevices entirely, resulting in a loss of contact with the MoS2 edge at certain spots.

CHF3 + O2 for 210 s. The etched regions display a very rough bottom surface, with partially etched hBN pyramids, and sidewalls featuring
narrow, vertical crevices with triangular facets, arising from the crystallographic planes of hBN. Two such crevices have been indicated by red
dotted lines. (b) SEM images of a curved trench etched in another (thinner) hBN flake with SF6 + Ar for 20 s. It exhibits a smooth bottom SiO2
surface with a significantly reduced density of unetched hBN pyramids. No triangular crevices like those indicated in a could be resolved in this
flake, although considerable sidewall roughness is still present. All images were taken immediately after etching, without removing PMMA, in
order to avoid deposition of any organic residues that might smear out the sharp hBN features and reduce image contrast. Upon interaction with
the electron beam (5 keV), the PMMA layer retracted away from the sides, allowing hBN to be imaged. Scale bars: 200 nm in all images.

iii
Moreover, within a single device, source and drain contacts formed along parallel etched trenches would have different faceting
due to the 60° rotational symmetry of hBN (and not 90°), giving rise to asymmetric ID -VDS characteristics. In case of SF6 + Ar
(1:1), the introduction of Ar adds a physical sputtering contribution to the etch process. This leads to more isotropic in-plane
etching, resulting in sidewalls devoid of triangular facets, as shown in Fig. S1b and lower contact variability (see Fig. S6).
Metal deposition and annealing: This is the most critical part of our fabrication process. As discussed in the main text, etched
MoS2 edges have a large number of dangling bonds that can host in-gap edge states6 and act as adsorption sites for air molecules
(O2 , H2 O). These adsorbed species could likely hinder covalent bonding between the contact metal (Ti) and MoS2 , leaving edge
states unpassivated, which subsequently act as traps for injected carriers. Moreover, Mo atoms located at the edge can oxidize to
form MoOx which, owing to its high work-function, would pose a further barrier for electron injection7 . Therefore, in order to limit
MoS2 oxidation after RIE, the samples were immediately loaded into an electron beam evaporator (Plassys MEB550S) for metal
deposition, with only a few minutes of air exposure in between. While loading, the etched contact trenches were aligned parallel to
the axis of the tilting motor and thereafter, the samples were not rotated in-plane at any point during sputtering and evaporation. To
remove any MoOx and form a clean MoS2 edge just before metal deposition, the contact edges were sputtered in-situ with an Ar+
ion beam at +15° and -15° tilt (Fig. S2b) for 15 s each (3.5 sccm flow rate, 250 V beam voltage, 50 V acceleration voltage, 10 mA
beam current). Since ion-gun parameters can vary from machine-to-machine, in order to make it easier for others to reproduce
our recipe, we estimated the etch rate of bare MoS2 in our case by comparing the optical images in Fig. S3 before and after sputtering.
Ti (5 nm) was then deposited at 0.2 nm/s rate under a base pressure of 1 × 10−7 mbar, first at +15° tilt and then 5 nm again
at -15° tilt, as depicted in Fig. S2c. Tilting was necessary to avoid shadowing of the MoS2 edge by the overhanging bilayer
PMMA sidewalls. In this manner, a nearly conformal Ti layer could be deposited over the hBN sidewalls despite the rough
topography, as visible in Fig. S2d. Au (40 + 40 nm) was then deposited at 0.2 nm/s in the same way. Note that the choice of
deposition angle was constrained by the PMMA undercut angle in our case. Deposition at 20° caused the PMMA sidewalls
to be also partially coated with Ti-Au, leaving behind vertical ears upon lift-off, while deposition at 30° resulted in no lift-off.
After lift-off in hot acetone, the samples were annealed at 300 ◦C in Ar + H2 (380 + 20 sccm) for 3 h inside a quartz tube
furnace to improve the contacts. Finally, for electrical characterization, wire-bonds were made manually with a 25 µm diameter
tungsten wire and silver epoxy (CircuitWorks® CW2400). The epoxy was cured at 80 ◦C for 30 min in a vacuum oven. Unlike conventional ultrasonic wire-bonding, Ag epoxy helped to prevent shorting with the Si back-gate through the 100 nm SiO2 layer.

Significance of annealing

Post metal-deposition annealing is commonly employed to lower the contact resistance (RC ) in 2D material devices. We
tested several temperatures for this purpose and found that for edge contacts annealed in Ar + H2 (380 + 20 sccm), ID improved
remarkably with increasing temperatures up to 400 ◦C, as shown in Fig. S4a. At the same time, the high interface quality of our
devices remained preserved due to hBN encapsulation, as evidenced by the unchanged steep subthreshold slope and negligible
hysteresis in all ID -VGS plots in Fig. S4b. Besides this, we also varied the annealing time at a fixed temperature but did not notice a
substantial change in ID after a total duration >1.5 h (Fig. S4c). We further extracted the RC and mobility values from the curves
in Fig. S4a and are plotted in Figs. S4d-e, respectively. A reduction in RC and mobility enhancement at higher temperatures clearly
highlight the importance of annealing. However, we also observed that too high temperatures can affect the long-term ambient
stability of our devices to a certain extent. Considering these facts, a temperature of 300 ◦C and time 2-3 h were therefore chosen as
optimum for our fabrication recipe. Lastly, un-annealed devices measured directly after metal deposition and lift-off, can sometimes
exhibit a large hysteresis in the transfer characteristics, as seen in Fig. S5a. Annealing can help to get rid of such hysteresis (Fig. S5b).

Thus, we can conclude that annealing is indispensable for edge contacts. In addition to Ar + H2 , we also tested annealing of
edge contacts in a high vacuum environment (<1 × 10−5 mbar), but the former resulted in a slightly better performance. Several
processes can occur simultaneously during annealing: metal-MoS2 covalent bonding, reduction of interfacial oxides and sulfur
atoms by H2 molecules, inter-diffusion of edge atoms (metal into MoS2 or vice-versa), defect migration and edge reconstruction.
Presently, it is unclear what processes dominate in case of edge contacts and are responsible for the reduction of RC upon annealing,
although Fig. S4c points towards a weaker contribution of diffusion, which is a slow, time-dependent process. Understanding the
various mechanisms at play and developing more effective annealing procedures is a promising subject for future studies.

Figure S4. Contact resistance reduction by annealing. (a) ID -VGS characteristics of a 1L-MoS2 device measured after annealing in Ar + H2
at three different temperatures. It can be seen that the current density increases monotonically with the annealing temperature, implying a
reduction in RC upon annealing. This enhancement can possibly be attributed to improvement of the edge contact interface, leading to reduced
scattering/trapping of electrons and thus, more efficient current injection. (b) ID -VGS data shown in a, plotted on a log-scale, exhibiting a
consistently steep subthreshold slope after each annealing cycle. Moreover, all plots comprise of both forward and backward sweeps that display
very small hysteresis (sweep directions marked by arrows). This indicates that in our devices, the MoS2 crystal quality and the low interface trap
density (∼1011 eV−1 cm−2 ), remain preserved by hBN encapsulation and do not deteriorate, at least up to 400 ◦C. (c) ID -VGS characteristics of

Data from additional devices

Here we show I-V data from devices in which edge contacts were etched with SF6 + Ar. The MoS2 flake shown in Fig. S6a was
exfoliated on PDMS and transferred to hBN (Fig. S6b-c). After encapsulating the MoS2 with another hBN and patterning the
resulting stack into two rectangular segments, edge contacts were fabricated on each (Fig. S6d). The ID -VDS characteristics of one
such device are plotted in Fig. S6e and display a nearly linear behavior without any sign of saturation, at least until 3 V. In Fig. S6f,
the ID -VGS curves of two representative devices are shown and exhibit very similar characteristics, indicating a low-variability in
contacts etched with SF6 + Ar, as discussed in Section S1 above. All ID -VGS curves in Fig. S6f have been fitted with the model
used in the main text. The excellent quality of the fits further corroborates the validity of the model. Log-scale ID -VGS plots are
shown in Fig. S6g, revealing a steep subthreshold slope and high on/off ratio, similar to Fig. 2c of the main text. These measurements, together with those in the main text, demonstrate that with our fabrication procedure, edge contacts can be made reproducibly.

MoS2 FETs with pure Au edge contacts

In addition to Ti-Au, we also fabricated edge contacts with pure Au (i.e. without any Ti adhesion layer), since Au has been
reported to result in low resistance contacts to MoS2 8 . Figure S7 shows the optical images of an hBN encapsulated 1L-MoS2
sample with Au edge contacts, together with the I-V characteristics of one device. However, this sample was among the very
few that were successfully fabricated since, in general, Au was found to often result in devices that did not conduct at all. Upon
closer inspection of failed samples in an SEM, we noticed gaps between Au and hBN in several contacts, as shown in Fig. S8. By
comparing the morphology of Au before and after annealing, we observed that during annealing at 300 ◦C, Au tends to reflow and
lose contact with hBN due to poor adhesion. This occurred despite Au deposition at an angle so as to completely cover the hBN
sidewalls. Therefore, we infer that pure Au in combination with high-temperature annealing, is not suitable for edge contacts.

Edge contacts without Ar+ sputtering

In the most general case, Ti-MoS2 edge contacts can be considered to be composed of Ti-TiOx -(air molecules)-MoOx -MoS2
junctions. For improving the contact performance, it is important to determine the role of each interfacial species. As discussed in
the main text, we fabricated several devices without sputtering the MoS2 contact edges with Ar+ , in order to leave air molecules
and MoOx (if any) intact. The transfer characteristics of three such devices, shown in Fig. S9a, exhibit a substantially lower ID
compared to Ar+ sputtered devices fabricated on the same hBN-MoS2 -hBN stack (see Fig. 1h of the main text). Furthermore, it
has been found previously by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)9 that Ti can oxidize to form TiOx when deposited under
moderately high vacuum conditions (∼1 × 10−6 mbar). To inhibit TiOx formation and study its effect, Ti-Au was deposited at
∼1 × 10−8 mbar on another sample (Fig. S9b), again without Ar+ sputtering. Before metal deposition on the contacts, Ti (80 nm)
was evaporated into the chamber while keeping the sample surface covered by a shutter, to capture residual O2 molecules and
lower the chamber pressure. However, as seen in Fig. S9c, ID still remains <1 µA/µm at VDS = 1 V, irrespective of channel length
L, revealing an RC dominated transport in all devices. Notably, one device displayed random conductance fluctuations (L = 1 µm),
implying an unstable contact while two others didn’t conduct at all (L = 0.5, 1.5 µm). These results underline the importance of
Ar+ sputtering in realizing good edge contacts and without it, the deposition pressure (i.e. the absence or presence of TiOx ), does
not make a significant difference.

in a and c were recorded after annealing in Ar + H2 at 200 ◦C for 3 h. The characteristics of un-sputtered devices did not improve considerably
upon further annealing at higher temperatures.

Quantum transport simulations

To gain further insight into carrier transport through edge contacts, we performed ballistic ab initio quantum transport
simulations based on density functional theory (DFT). The non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) formalism was used for this
purpose, which involves solving the following equation,
RB

R

(1)

[ E − HMLWF (k z ) − Σ (E, k z ) ] · G (E, k z ) = I

for the momentum k z and energy E dependent retarded Green’s function G (E, k z ) and boundary self-energy Σ (E, k z ). The
Hamiltonian matrix HMLWF (k z ) was expressed in a maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF) basis. It was constructed
according to the upscaling technique described in Ref. 10 for the Ti-MoS2 edge contact structure depicted schematically in
Fig. S10a. The size of HMLWF (k z ) is equal to NA × Norb , where NA is the number of atoms in the simulation domain and Norb is
the average number of MLWF per atom. Once Eq. 1 was solved for all energies and momenta of interest, the density-of-states

be computed, from which the charge density and electronic current were derived. Here, G (E, k z ) is the advanced Green’s function
and Γ11/N N is the broadening function corresponding to the first (index 1) and last (index N) unit cell of the contact geometry.

The resulting spatially- and energetically-resolved DOS(E) =
k z DOS(E, k z ) is displayed in Fig. S10b. From this plot,
the Ti-MoS2 band alignment and the resulting Schottky barrier height (φSB ) can be identified. The energy-dependent electron
Í
transmission function T (E) = kz T (E, k z ) is plotted in Fig. S10c. The total injected current density was then determined via
the Landauer-Büttiker formalism by multiplying T (E, k z ) with the difference between the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions
f (E,T) (i.e. the occupation probability at a given temperature) of the right and left contacts and integrating the result over energy
and momentum. Figure S10d shows the simulated current density as a function of temperature. Since in real devices the contact
metal Fermi level is often strongly pinned close to the MoS2 conduction band minimum11,12 and because DFT, in general, does
not accurately estimate the band offset between two materials, the current was calculated for several values of φSB . This was done
by artificially raising the metal Fermi level indicated in Fig. S10b. As evident from Fig. S10d, the injected current density remains
largely independent of temperature, regardless of the barrier height, which corroborates the measured ID -VGS characteristics in Fig.
4a of the main text.
The relative temperature insensitivity of the current can be traced back to the underlying carrier injection mechanism and the
shape of the transmission function T (E). In case of Ti-MoS2 edge contacts, the largest contribution to the current does not come
from thermionic processes but instead from quantum mechanical tunneling through the Schottky barrier, which does not heavily
depend on temperature. Furthermore, the magnitude of the transmission function from Ti to MoS2 does not vary much around the

Fermi energy such that the current ID for large VDS can be approximated as, ID ≈ e~ E C · f (E, EF ,T) dE, where Emin corresponds

to the conduction band minimum of MoS2 far from the interface region, EF is the Fermi level of the metal contact and C is a
constant. It can be shown that such an expression exhibits little to no dependence on the temperature T.

Figure S10. Quantum transport simulations of edge contacts. (a) Schematic cross-section and (b) computed band-diagram of a Ti - monolayer MoS2 edge

contact structure. The color scale in (b) represents the DOS per unit area plotted on a linear scale, the horizontal red dashed line denotes the Fermi level EF
and φSB indicates the Schottky barrier height. The effect of an applied gate bias was incorporated by shifting the MoS2 conduction band minima to 1 eV below
EF . (c) Energy dependent electron transmission probability T(E) for the DOS distribution shown in b. (d) Total current density as a function of temperature,
calculated for three different φSB values. We find that the injected current density depends only weakly on temperature for T<300 K since the transmission function
in c does not change appreciably around the Fermi level.
