ON SINGULAR POINTS AND OSCILLATORY INTEGRALS
TOSHIO NAGANO AND NAOYA MIYAZAKI
Dedicated to Emeritus Professor Hideki Omori on his 80th birthday
Abstract. In this note, we generalize the Fresnel integrals using oscillatory
integral, and then we obtain an extention of the stationary phase method.

1. Introduction
In the present note, we study a method for an asymptotic expansion of the
following integral
Z
eiλφ(x) a(x)dx
I(λ) :=
Rn

as a real positive parameter λ → ∞. For the purpose we first give a summary of
the original method relating to theory of asymptotic expansion in §2. In particular,
the stationary phase method is known as a method for an asymptotic expansion of
an oscillatory integral of a phase function with a non-degenerate critical point.
In §3, we extend the Fresnel integrals by changing of a path for integration in the
well-known proof using Cauchy’s integral theorem. Next, according to oscillatory
integral, we also obtain further generalization of the Fresnel integrals.
Furthermore, in §4, we establish finer generalization of the stationary phase
method.
As mentioned as above, the several proofs of the Fresnel integrals are known ([17]
I p.326, II p.85, 245, etc.). In particular, we are interested in the proof of applying
2
Cauchy’s integral theorem to a function e−iz on the domain surrounded by a fan
with the center at the origin of Gaussian plane ([10]). By changing the fan used in
the proof, we can generalize the Fresnel integrals in the following way:

where χ ∈ S(R) with χ(0) = 1. This equalities hold for p > 0 and q > 0 (Theorem
3.3 (i)). These results can be considered as an extension of the case of λ = q − 1 and
ξ = 1 in the Fourier transform of Gel’fand-Shilov generalized function F [x+ λ ](ξ)
with λ ∈ C \ {−1} ([6] p.170.):

where Reτ > 0. By our results, we can become to treat the oscillatory integrals
for a phase function with a degenerate critical point expressed by positive real
power. And then, using the result obtained as above, we give an extention of the
stationary phase method in one variable (Theorem 4.1 (iv)).
To the end of §1, we remark notation which will be used in this note:

C ∞ (Rn ) is the set of complex-valued C ∞ functions on Rn . C0∞ (Rn ) is the set
of all f ∈ C ∞ (Rn ) with compact support. S(Rn ) is the Schwartz space of rapidly
decreasing C ∞ functions on Rn , that is, the Fréchet space of all f ∈ C ∞ (Rn ) such
that supx∈Rn |xβ ∂xα f (x)| < ∞ for any multi-indecies α, β ∈ (Z≥0 )n .
O means a Landau’s symbol, that is, f (x) = O(g(x)) (x → a) if |f (x)/g(x)| is
bounded as x → a for functions f and g.
2. Preliminary
In this section, we recall the oscillatory integrals and the original stationary
phase method.
Definition 2.1. Let λ ≥ 1 and let φ be a real-valued C ∞ function on Rn and
a ∈ C ∞ (Rn ). If there exists

independent of χ ∈ S(Rn ) with χ(0) = 1 and 0 < ε < 1, then we call I˜φ [a](λ) an
oscillatory integral where we call φ (resp. a) a phase function (resp. an amplitude
function).
If we suppose a certain suitable conditions for φ and a, then we can show I˜φ [a](λ)
exists independent of χ and ε. The fundamental properties are the following (cf.
[13] p.47.):
Proposition 2.2. Assume that χ ∈ S(Rn ) with χ(0) = 1. Then

(i) χ(εx) → 1 uniformly on any compact set in Rn as ε → +0.
(ii) For each multi-index α ∈ (Z≥0 )n , there exists a positive constant Cα independent of 0 < ε < 1 such that for x ∈ Rn
|∂xα (χ(εx))| ≤ Cα (1 + |x|2 )−|α|/2 .

(iii) For any multi-index α ∈ (Z≥0 )n with α 6= 0, ∂xα χ(εx) → 0 uniformly in Rn
as ε → +0.
Next we recall the Fresnel integrals (cf. [10] p.23.).

Next we summarize the Fourier transforms of rapidly decreasing C ∞ functions.
Definition 2.4. Let f ∈ S(Rn ). Then we define by fb = F [f ] the Fourier transform
of f as

where hx, ξi := k=1 xk ξk for x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and ξ = (ξ1 , . . . , ξn ) ∈ Rn .

If A is a real symmetric non-singular n × n matrix, then the Fourier transform
of ei(1/2)hAx,xi is given in the following way (cf. [8], [9], [3], [7], [5]).

Proposition 2.5. Let A be a real symmetric non-singular n × n matrix with “p”
positive and “n − p” negative eigenvalues.

By Propsition 2.5, we can obtain an asymptotic expansion of the oscillatory
integral with a non-degenerate quadratic phase φ(x) = (1/2)hAx, xi in the following
way.
Proposition 2.6. Suppose that λ ≥ 1, a ∈ S(Rn ) and A is a real symmetric nonsingular n × n matrix. Then, there exists a positive constant C such that for any

In order to treat more general cases of the phase function, we prepare the following two lemmas. The first one is the Morse lemma ([14], [3], [7], [5]).

Lemma 2.7. Let φ be a real-valued C ∞ function on a neighborhood of x̄ in Rn such
that x̄ is an only non-degenerate critical point of φ, that is, if and only if ∇φ(x̄) = 0,
and det Hessφ(x̄) 6= 0. Then there exist neighborhoods U of x̄ and V of 0 in Rn and
C ∞ diffeomorphism Φ : V −→ U such that x = Φ(y) for x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ U and
y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) ∈ V and

positive and “n − p” negative eigenvalues.
φ(x) − φ(x̄) =

The second one is for an estimation of the remainder of an asymptotic expansion
for an oscillatory integral ([9], [5]).
Lemma 2.8. Let λ ≥ 1 and a ∈ S(Rn ) and let φ be a real-valued C ∞ function
on Rn with |∇φ(x)| ≥ d > 0 for x ∈ suppa. Then for each N ∈ N, there exists a
positive constant CN such that

We are now in a position to state the stationary phase method ([8], [9], [3], [5]).
Theorem 2.9. Suppose that λ ≥ 1, a ∈ S(Rn ) and φ is a real-valued C ∞ function
on a neighborhood of x̄ in Rn such that x̄ is an only non-degenerate critical point of
φ. Then there exist neighborhoods U of x̄ and V of 0 in Rn and C ∞ diffeomorphism
Φ : V −→ U such that x = Φ(y) for x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ U and y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) ∈ V ,
and for each N ∈ N, there exists a positive constant CN such that

If q ≥ p > 0, we can make a sense of (3.1) as oscillatory integrals. In order to
show this, we prepare the following lemma.
Lemma 3.2. Assume that p > 0 and q > 0. Let χ ∈ S(R) with χ(0) = 1 and
0 < ε < 1. Then we have
(i) For each k ∈ Z≥0 , there exist the following independent of χ and ε

the proof.

By Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, we obtain the following theorem.

with poles of order 1 at p = −q/j for j ∈ N as to p for each q > 0 by
analytic continuation.

Double signs ± in same order. We call I˜p,q
“generalized Fresnel integrals”.
Proof. When p > q, applying Lemma 3.2 (iii) and Lemma 3.1 give (i). When q ≥ p,
repeating use of integration by part combining with Lemma 3.1 show (i). Using
analytic continuation of the Gamma function with (i) proves (ii).

Using the theorem above, we can extend the Euler Beta function as follow.

4. An Extension of the Stationary Phase Method
In this section, we consider an extension of the stationary phase method in one
variable according to the generalized Fresnel integrals developed as above.

Proof. (i) Put f (x) = eiλx xq−1 a(x), then f (x) = O(xα ) (x → +0) when α =
q − 1 > −1 and f (x) = O(xβ ) (x → ∞) when β = q − 1 − (q + 1) < −1. This shows
(i). According to integration by part, we show the second assertion (ii). As to
(iii), first we divide this integral into the principal part and the remainder term by
Taylor expansion of a at 0. And then applying Theorem 3.3 (i) after using change
of variable y = λ1/p x in the former and applying (ii) in the latter completes the
proof. (iv) If the variable is negative, we first change a variable x = −y. Then (iii)
proves (iv).

To the end of the present note, we note that we obtain asymptotic expansion of
oscillatory integral in several variables with not only the Morse type phase function
but also singular types for examples A, E-phase functions. For details, see [15].
