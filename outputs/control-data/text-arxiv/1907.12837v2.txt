In nature, instances of synchronisation abound across a diverse range of environments. In the
quantum regime, however, synchronisation is typically observed by identifying an appropriate parameter regime in a specific system. In this work we show that this need not be the case, identifying conditions which, when satisfied, guarantee that the individual constituents of a generic open
quantum system will undergo completely synchronous limit cycles which are, to first order, robust
to symmetry-breaking perturbations. We then describe how these conditions can be satisfied by
the interplay between several elements: interactions, local dephasing and the presence of a strong
dynamical symmetry - an operator which guarantees long-time non-stationary dynamics. These
elements cause the formation of entanglement and off-diagonal long-range order which drive the
synchronised response of the system. To illustrate these ideas we present two central examples: a
chain of quadratically dephased spin-1s and the many-body charge-dephased Hubbard model. In
both cases perfect phase-locking occurs throughout the system, regardless of the specific microscopic parameters or initial states. Furthermore, when these systems are perturbed, their non-linear
responses elicit long-lived signatures of both phase and frequency-locking.

INTRODUCTION

Synchronization is a fascinating and multi-disciplinary
topic in modern science, focussed on understanding how
a collection of individual bodies adjust their natural
rhythms and phases through their interactions with each
other and the environment [1–5]. In a striking display of
cooperative behaviour, this adjustment can lead to a variety of phenomena such as the ‘winking’ of fireflies, the
behavioural synchrony of groups of strangers or the coupling of a pair of pendulums through a mutual support
[6–8].
The study of synchronisation in quantum systems has
attracted significant attention [9–15]. In this regime, synchronisation takes on a fairly broad definition due to the
variety of cooperative, entangled behaviour that can occur [16]. The formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC), for example, could be considered perfect synchronisation [17] due to the collective condensation of
the atoms in the bosonic gas. In closer analogy to classical systems, models of self-sustained quantum oscillators,
such as quantum Van der Pol oscillators [13, 18, 19] or
pairs of micromasers [20], have been shown to lock phases
and reach coupled limit cycles. Quantum effects play a
decisive role in either enhancing [21, 22] or hindering [23]
this synchronicity. Under the mean-field approximation,
these results have been extended to larger systems of oscillators where the underlying mechanism for synchronisation is a reduction in the uncertainty in the phase distribution at the expense of the certainty in the number
distribution [18].
Recently, there has been a focus on observing synchronisation in the limit cycles of quantum systems which
have no classical analogue [9–11]. The qutrit has been
proposed as a logical candidate for this and recent work
has demonstrated that it can be entrained to an external signal [9, 11] or phase-locked and entangled with a
second spin [10]. In these single or two qutrit systems,

synchronisation emerges due to careful control over the
Hamiltonian and dissipation parameters and is witnessed
through both the phase space portrait and entanglement
profile of the spins.
One of the most remarkable features of synchronisation
in the classical regime, however, is that it occurs in such a
diverse range of systems - with completely different sizes,
structures and microscopic parameters [6–8, 24]. This
diversity, in turn, leads to a rich variety of observable,
complex behaviour. Hence, instead of identifying specific
quantum systems and regions of parameter space where
a synchronised response can be observed, we consider it
pertinent to take a different route and determine, more
generally, conditions which will ensure synchronisation in
a quantum system.
In this work we adopt this approach, identifying these
conditions and uncovering a novel mechanism which
guarantees synchronisation in a generic open quantum
system, independent of its microscopic details. We show
how these conditions can be satisfied via the interplay between several elements: interactions, local dephasing and
the existence of a strong dynamical symmetry (an operator which guarantees non-stationary dynamics in the
long-time limit of the system [25]). The coaction of these
elements underpins the formation of a structure to the
long-time density matrix which ensures limit cycles describing entangled, cooperative behaviour. These cycles
capture the essence of quantum synchronisation, describing oscillations where the constituents of the system are
locked to a common phase and frequency whilst also featuring the off-diagonal long-range order present in states
such as BECs and superconductors [26, 27]. Furthermore, we prove that this mechanism for synchronisation
is, to first order, completely robust to the presence of
symmetry-breaking perturbations.
We then present several physical examples, which have
no classical analogue, where this phenomenon arises - a
chain of interacting spin 1s and the many-body charge-

2
dephased Hubbard model. These systems exhibit perfect
distance-invariant phase synchronisation for a wide range
of parameters and initial states. Moreover, in these examples, we are able to identify analytical expressions for
the long-time density matrix - which is typically an unfeasible task in strongly-correlated many-body systems.
Finally, we peturb these systems away from the dynamical symmetry regime where the non-linear response facilitates the observation of strong, exceptionally long-lived
signatures of both phase and frequency locking.
Quantum synchronisation is sometimes viewed in
terms of a locking in phase space of self-sustained oscillators, measured through the Husimi-Q or Wigner phase
space distributions [9, 10, 19]. In the work and examples in this manuscript we have, instead, opted to focus on the explicit limit cycles of the bodies in the system and plot them alongside the various quantum synchronisation measures we use (such as the entanglement
or off-diagonal coherences). This is in order to reflect
our intuition of quantum synchronisation as an intrinsically rhythmic process underpinned by quantum properties not available in classical systems. Our definition
exposes the presence of quantum properties in the synchronised states which are less easy to see in, for example,
the Husimi-Q distribution.

SYNCHRONISATION IN GENERIC
QUANTUM SYSTEMS
A.

Strong Dynamical Symmetries

Firstly, we introduce the concept of a strong dynamical
symmetry by providing a brief summary of the work in
[25], we restrict ourselves to Markovian dynamics for simplicity. Consider the time evolution of the density matrix
of an open quantum system via the Lindblad equation
(here, and in the remainder of this work, we set ~ = 1)
X

1
∂ρ
= Lρ = −i[H, ρ] +
γj Lj ρL†j − {L†j Lj , ρ}
∂t
2
j
= −i[H, ρ] + D[ρ],

(1)

where H is the Hamiltonian of the system and {Lj } are
a set of ‘jump’ operators which model the interaction between the system and the environment with associated
coupling strengths {γj }. The jump operators are used to
form the dissipator D[ρ] which competes with the coherent evolution due to the Hamiltonian H. We denote the
Liouvillian superoperator with L and the steady state(s)
as ρss , which satisfy Lρss = 0.
If we can identify an operator A which satisfies
[H, A] = ωA,

[Lj , A] = [L†j , A] = 0 ∀j, ω ∈ R

(2)

then we say that the system posseses a ‘strong dynamical symmetry’. The relation [H, A] = ωA describes the
presence of a dynamical symmetry operator. We then

refer to this as a strong dynamical symmetry operator
because it commutes with all the jump operators and
their conjugates [28].
It is then straightforward to prove from these relations
that there exists a series of eigenmodes of L of the form
ρn,m ∝ (A)n ρss (A† )m ,

Lρn,m = iω(m − n)ρn,m , (3)

where the corresponding imaginary eigenvalues indicate
the presence of non-stationary dynamics in the long-time
limit of the system. The operator A acts as a raising/lowering operator, generating a ladder of equidistant
mixed states within the kernel of the Liouvillian. These
results extend beyond that of a decoherence free subspace [29, 30] as the imaginary modes are, in general,
mixed and cannot be written as a convex superposition
of pure states |φi hφ| which are immune to the dissipation
Lj |φi = 0 ∀j.

B.

Quantum Synchronisation via Dynamical
Symmetries, Interactions and Dephasing

We now show how a generic open quantum system
can provide a natural environment for observing quantum synchronisation. Consider an open quantum system
where the Hilbert space is constructed from a series of N
identical, local spaces or ‘bodies’ H = ⊗j Hj .
We now imagine the system has a strong dynamical
symmetry operator satisfying Eq. (2) and assume the
imaginary modes from Eq. (3) form a complete basis for
the long-time density matrix of the system. Conseqently,
we can write this state as

X 
lim ρ(t) = ρ∞ (t) =
Cn,m eiω(m−n)t ρn,m + h.c. ,
t→∞

n,m; n≥m

(4)
where the Cn,m are a set of real coefficients associated
with the overlap between the initial state and the ρn,m .
Now, consider the
Q expectation value of some M -point
observable X = j∈B Xj , where B = {a, b, c, ...} is a
set of M local spaces containing no duplicates and Xj is
some hermitian local operator acting on site j. It follows
from Eq. (4) that
lim hXi(t) =

t→∞

X

Dn,m cos (ω(m − n)t) + const.,

n,m; n>m

(5)
with Dn,m = 2Tr(Xρn,m )Cn,m . Provided that Dn,m 6= 0
for at least one n, m where |n − m| = 0 then Eq. (5)
describes coherent, non-decaying limit cycles in the associated observable. The equidistance of the imaginary
eigenspectrum is crucial and ensures the frequencies involved are commensurate and do not destructively interfere with each other. These limit cycles, along with the
well-defined, coherent phase-evolution described in Eq.
(4) are some of the hallmark features of temporal synchronisation.

3
Importantly, to have full synchronisation we need each
of the bodies to undergo the same coherent phase evolution. Whilst the existence of a strong dynamical symmetry ensures non-stationarity, it does not mean that
the bodies will lock together in phase space and undergo
identical limit cycles. The fundamental requirements for
this to happen are that the steady state and strong dynamical symmetry operator(s) are translationally invariant and, as assumed earlier, form a complete basis for the
long-time density matrix ρ∞ (t) of the system. If these
requirements are met then, through Eq. (3), the ρn,m
and thus ρ∞ (t) will inherit the translational symmetry
of these operators and the limit cycles described in Eq.
(5) will be independent of the specific bodies in the set
B = {a, b, c, ...} (only the cardinality of the set matters).
Consequently, the system will be perfectly synchronised
as all the bodies in the system will be locked to the same
frequency and phase - independent of the specific value
of any microscopic parameters.
Recent work has shown that the interplay between
interactions and local, homogeneous dephasing in an
open quantum system can ‘wash’ out any geometry associated with the system: creating steady states with
off-diagonal long-range order and ensuring they, along
with any strong dynamical symmetry operators, are completely translationally symmetric (see [25, 31]). These
states and operators form a complete basis for the longtime density matrix of the system. Hence, following the
discussion in the previous paragraph, we identify interactions between the bodies in our system as well as local, homogeneous dephasing [? ] as elements which,
when combined with the existence of a strong dynamical
symmetry, can ensure the system reaches a completely
quantum synchronised state: i.e. with locked limit cycles
underpinned by intrinsically quantum properties such as
entanglement and off-diagonal long-range order. We will
illuminate these ideas with a pair of examples in Sec. 3
and explicitly show these fully synchronised cycles alongside their intrinsically quantum behaviour.
We anticipate that for synchronisation to occur in our
framework via homogeneous, local dephasing the local
Hilbert space dimension should satisfy Dim(Hj ) > 2.
This is because there must be local coherences available
in the long-time limit where a valid phase relationship
can be established and the system can undergo long-time
oscillations. Any non-trivial local dephasing in an array
of 2-level systems will destroy the available coherences
and prevent the qubits from undergoing a valid limitcycle, a pre-requisite for synchronisation. This argument
does not apply to arrays of 2-level systems under more
general non-local dissipation.
In this work we consider synchronisation under the
Markov approximation and so are limited to weakly interacting systems. However, in our examples synchronisation occurs for any finite interaction strength – its amplitude only sets the timescale on which a synchronised
state is reached. Hence, even if the interaction strength
is small, the system will eventually reach a synchronised

state (in experimental setups care should also be taken
that the timescale on which synchronisation occurs is
shorter than the coherence time of the system). Moreover, we emphasize that highly controllable quantum systems such as lattices of ultracold atoms immersed in a
Bose-Einstein Condensate [25, 31], can be engineered to
accurately implement dynamics described by local master equations.

C.

Perturbations away from the Dynamical
Symmetry Regime

We now show how the synchronisation discussed in the
previous section is robust to perturbations away from the
dynamical symmetry regime. Typically, we can imagine
that the relation [H, A] = ωA fromPEq. (2) arises due
to some homogeneous field F = ω j fj in the Hamiltonian for which A is a raising/ lowering operator. The
synchronisation described in the previous section is then
a consequence of perfect phase locking of the individual
constituents of the systems, frequency locking will occur
because the individual bodies j share the same natural
frequency ω.
P
If the field is not homogeneous, i.e. F = j ωj fj , then
the Hamiltonian H can be split
Pinto two terms. The first
contains a homogeneous term j ω̄j fj and all other nonfield terms,
the second contains only the inhomogeneous
P
part j δj fj . We have parametrised ωj as ωj = ω̄j +
δj where ω̄j is the average of the set {ωj }. We then,
correspondingly, split the Liouvillian into two parts and
scale by 1/ω̄j :
L(0)

L = L(0) + L(1) ,
P
= − ω̄ij [H − j δj fj , •] + ω̄1j D[•],
i
hP
δj
• ,
L(1) = −i
j δ̄j fj ,

(6)

where  = δ̄j /ω̄j is the, small, perturbation parameter
and δ̄j is the average over the set of detunings {δj }. We
then assume that the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of this
new Liouvillian are perturbations on those for L(0)
ρ = ρ(0) + ρ(1) + 2 ρ(2) + . . . ,
λ = λ(0) + λ(1) + 2 λ(2) + . . . .

(7)

It then follows (see Supplemental Material,
SM) that the
h
i

(1)
(0) † (1) (0)
first order eigenvalue shift is λ = Tr ρ
L ρ
,
which is purely imaginary as it can be rearranged to be
the trace of a skew-hermitian matrix. As a result, to
first order, the eigenvalues of the eigenmodes in Eq. (3)
remain imaginary and thus there is no decay in the system’s long-time dynamics when perturbed away from the
dynamical symmetry regime.
Moreover, if the imaginary eigenmodes are unchanged
under a swap between
h two†bodies ij and l then we have
that λ(1) = 0 as Tr ρ(0) fj ρ(0) is independent of j.

4
As discussed in Sec. II B this symmetry in the imaginary
modes is seen for local, translationally-invariant dephasing in an interacting system [25, 31]. Hence, the system
will undergo completely non-linear response to peturbations away from the dynamical symmetry regime. To first
order, the solutions in Eq. (3) are still eigenmodes and so
will decay with a rate that scales at least quadratically
with the perturbation parameter . Hence they correspond to ‘slow’ modes which will, in general, decay much
slower than rest of the eigenmodes of the Liouvillian.
We can therefore expect to transiently observe the corresponding synchronised features these eigenmodes possess, with a lifetime that scales at least quadratically
with the perturbation parameter . The individual constituents will be locked in both phase and frequency, despite having different natural frequencies.
This appearance of synchronisation due to the formation of ‘slow’ decay modes in the Liouvillian which lock
the system to specific frequencies is consistent with the
mechanism for transient synchronisation discussed in [16]
and observed in [32].

III.

EXAMPLES

We have shown how, in a generic interacting open
quantum system, the combination of interactions, local
dephasing and a strong dynamical symmetry can underpin a coherent, distance-invariant, synchronised structure
to the long-time density matrix. Furthermore, the system is robust to perturbations away from the dynamical
symmetry regime. In order to elucidate these results we
present a pair of paradigmatic examples where they can
be observed.

A.

Synchronisation in a chain of Spin-1s

For our first example, we take a system formed from a
series of spin-1s or qutrits. The local basis for each spin1 is spanned by the three states {|↓i , |0i , |↑i}. The key
operators are Sj+ , Sj− and Sjz which are, respectively, the
spin-1 raising, lowering and magnetisation operators for
spin j. The x and y components of the spin-1 operator
can be formed from the raising and lowering operators:
Sjx = (1/2)(Sj+ +Sj− ), Sjy = (i/2)(Sj− −Sj+ ). By dropping
the local
P subscript we denote the total of an operator, e.g.
S z = j Sjz .
We take a spin-1 anisotropic Heisenberg model in a
chain geometry [33] (see Fig. 1)

where the spins each have natural frequency ωj and

Initially, in order to derive an analytical solution to the
long-time dynamics, we focus on the ‘frequency-matched’
case ωj = ω, ∀j. In the SM we prove that the 2N + 2
steady states alway take the form

The long-time dynamics of L is not, however, solely
governed by this steady state. We identify (see SM) multiple strong dynamical symmetry operators of the form

these operators on the steady state. Explicitly, we have,

the grey colour indicates Abs(ρµν ) = 0 and so the phase is not

Hilbert space in lexicographic order when they are converted
to ternary strings with ↑= 2, 0 = 1, ↓= 0. As an example
when µ = 1 this corresponds to the basis vector |↑↑↑i =
|222i and when µ = 27: |↓↓↓i = |000i. Example element
(ringed in red) has a phase which evolves in time as θ =
2mωt where m is the magnetisation of the corresponding basis
vector |mi i h−m0i |.

which is a non-trivial result as the steady-state ρss is
inherently singular. Further application of Am is redundant as Am Am = 0 and thus, each Am generates a unique
imaginary eigenmode ρm
1,0 via left-multiplication of the
steady-state. Crucially, however, the eigenspectrum is
still equidistant as the eigenvalues of the different modes
form a ladder with a spacing of 2ω. Hence, the structure
of the long-time eigenspace is analogous to a system with
a single strong dynamical symmetry operator.
The steady state and imaginary eigenmodes in Eqs.
(30) and (12) form a complete basis for the long-time
dynamics of Eq. (27) and so, similarly to Eq. (4), the
density matrix can be expressed as a superposition of
these modes in the limit t → ∞. The imaginary modes
describe coherences between sectors of opposite magnetisation, their excitement will ensure the system reaches
a limit cycle in the long-time limit. Moreover, the density matrix is completely translationally invariant; as described in Sec. 2B the dephasing and interactions have
washed out any geometry in the system, which now has
no characteristic length-scale. This invariance can be
seen in the off-diagonal coherences described in Eq. (3),
which occur at all length-scales of the chain and are completely uniform with respect to distance.
In Fig. 2 we visualise the analytical results in Eqs.
(30), (12) and (14). We present a plot of the eigenspec-

trum of L [Fig. 2(a)], the formation of these imaginary
eigenmodes is clear and their spacing is set by the value
of ω. We also show the structure of the density matrix in
the long-time limit of Eq. (27) [Fig. 2(b)]. The system is
in a superposition of the steady state in Eq. (30) and the
imaginary modes in Eq. (12), hence it only has elements
along the diagonal and anti-diagonal in the configuration
basis. The magnitude of each of these matrix elements
is constant in time. The phase of the elements along the
anti-diagonal is well-defined and evolves in time at a frequency f = 2mω for the corresponding matrix element
|mi i h−m0i |.
We can explicitly prove that this coherent density matrix structure leads to observable synchronisation in the
long-time limit Q
of the system. Specifically, consider the
operator X = j∈B (Sjx )2 , where B = {a, b, c, ...} is a
set of M sites containing no duplicates. The operator
is formed from quadratic, local operators which measure
fluctuations in the magnetisation. The quadratic form is
necessary in order to be able to measure the coherences
between the basis states |↓i and |↑i - any operator formed
solely from linear local operators will relax to stationarity. We prove (see SM) that in the limit t → ∞
hXi = D0 Tr(ρss X) +

M
X

Dm cos(2mωt)Tr(ρm
1,0 X),

m=1

(15)
where the real coefficients Dm are those associated with
the overlap between the initial state ρ(0) and either the
imaginary eigenmodes or the steady state. The trace
overlap Tr(ρm
1,0 X) only depends on the cardinality of B,
not the specific sites within the set; a direct consequence
of the complete translational invariance of the modes
spanning the kernel. Consequently hXi is also independent of the specific choice of sites over which we measure the correlator X, only the number of sites matters.
Thus we see that the long-time dynamics will perfectly
synchronise the spin-1s to clean, coherent limit-cycles regardless of the specific values of the initial state or the
Liouvillian parameters.
Moreover, the modes in Eq. (12) are entangled and
cannot be written as a superposition of separable states
- which we explicitly show in the following numerics.
We also demonstrate that the reduced correlator hXi −
Q
j∈B hXj i is distance-invariant and non-zero. Hence, we
consider the synchronisation observed in Eq. (15) to be
inherently quantum - underpinned by long-range correlations, which are a result of entanglement between the
bodies in the system.
z
In Eq. (28), the Siz Si+1
(ZZ) term is an interaction
term and hence the parameter ∆ sets the strength of the
interactions[? ] and plays a critical role in the formation of synchronisation. Specifically, the ZZ interaction
ensures that only translationally invariant strong dynamical symmetries and steady states are present. Therefore,
the asymptotic time-dependent density matrix also possesses this symmetry which, in turn, implies perfect synchronization (see Section 2B). Provided ∆ 6= 0 this will

6
always be case, with the explicit value of ∆ only effecting
the time-scale on which synchronisation occurs. When
∆ = 0 there are additional steady states and strong dynamical symmetries of the Liouvillian (see SM for an example) which are not translationally invariant and interfere with the symmetry of the known solutions described
earlier, disrupting the synchronicity of the system.
All of these results are valid for any arbitrary length
chain of N spin-1s under the Liouvillian in Eq. (27). In
the subsequent numerics we focus on a small series of
spin-1s, i.e. N = 3 or N = 4. This is because as the
system sizes increases, for generic initial states (product
states for example), the diagonal correlations become increasingly dominant in the long-time limit compared to
the off-diagonal coherences (|D0 |  |Dm6=0 |), reducing
the amplitude of the synchronisation measures in the
system (this amplitude will, however, remain finite for
any finite-size system). Consequently, by focussing on a
small chain, we can readily resolve the features of quantum synchronisation and directly witness our analytical
calculations by solving the master equation in Eq. (27)
through numerical exponentiation of the Liouvillian superoperator L. Later in the text we will present our
second example where synchronisation is induced via our
mechanism and is observable even in the thermodynamic
limit. The combination of these two examples emphasizes how this symmetry-induced synchronisation occurs
in systems of varying size and structure.
For the following results, we start in a specified initial
state and then time-evolve it under the Liouvillian in
Eq. (27) measuring various time-dependent quantities in
order to observe the formation of synchronisation. As
a first synchronisation measure for the local observables
in our model we consider the time-dependent Pearsoncorrelation factor [14, 34]. It can be used to measure the
correlation over time for two functions f, g defined on a

In Fig. 3 we set f = h(Sjx )2 i and g = h(Slx )2 i in order
to measure the synchronisation over time between two of
the spin-1s j and l - we start from a completely random
product state. We also include the individual functions
h(Sjx )2 i over time for each spin. In agreement with Eq.
(15), when both the environment and interactions are
present (γ, ∆ 6= 0) the dynamics causes the spins to
synchronise perfectly [Figs. 3(a) and (d)] to the same
frequency and phase, despite being initialised with random phases. The frequency of the oscillations is directly
determined by the equidistant spacing of the imaginary
eigenvalues. For comparison [Fig. 3(b)] we show the case
when the environment is present but there are no interac-

tions (γ 6= 0, ∆ = 0). The presence of dissipation causes
the system to converge to the expected clean coherent
limit cycles [25] but the limit cycles for each spin are out
of phase. Despite the fact the system still has a strong dynamical symmetry, the absence of interactions prevents
synchronisation as the kernel of the Liouvillian still has

7
a memory of the initial geometry of the system. We also
show the closed case when γ = 0 [Figs. 3(c) and (f)],
the dynamics are completely chaotic and unsynchronised
due to the multitude of incommensurate frequencies in
the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian.
Whilst the plots in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the
spins are able to perfecly lock phases they do not capture the collective origin of this synchronisation. In
this vein, in Fig. 4, we plot the reduced correlator
A = h(Sjx )2 (Slx )2 i − h(Sjx )2 ih(Slx )2 i, which is non-zero
and identical for any choice of spins j and l. The observed oscillations contain several frequencies [Fig. 4(b)]
due to the excitement of multiple imaginary modes in
Eq. (12). These imaginary modes all contain coherences
between different spins, the synchronisation observed in
Fig. 3 is dependent on the existence of these inter-spin
coherences and Fig. 4 shows that they give rise to perfect,
distance-invariant correlations throughout the system.
So far we have considered the ‘homogeneous’ case
ωj = ω ∀j. The spins share the same natural frequency
and we have shown how, under dephasing and interactions, their phases will align perfectly. In order to discuss synchronisation in full we now set the frequencies
of the spins to be mismatched. In this case, the imaginary modes in Eq. (3) are no longer exact eigenvectors
of the Liouvillian and, in the long-time limit, the system will decay to an ensemble which is diagonal in the
configuration basis - where no synchronisation can occur.
However, as was shown in Eq. (6), for sufficiently small
values of , the system is only slightly perturbed from a
‘dynamical symmetry’ regime defined by the spins having
a common frequency which is the average of their natural
frequencies. Furthermore due to the translational symmetry of the imaginary eigenmodes, we know the system
is, to first order, completely robust to this kind of perturbation. Hence, it is interesting to observe whether the
spins are able to synchronise to the dynamical symmetry
regime on an intermediate time-scale and, if so, how long
the system takes to desynchronise and reach a diagonal
ensemble.
As measures to track this, and to highlight the quantum nature of the synchronisation in Figs. 3 and 4, we
introduce two common witnesses for quantum synchronisation: the negativity N [35] and off-diagonal coherences

system is synchronised, and due to the off-diagonal, entangled nature of the modes in Eq. (3) quantities such
as these will remain finite indefinitely.
In Fig. 5 we show how these synchronisation witnesses
evolve in time when the system is perturbed from the dynamical symetry regime. We use the detuning strength δ
to characterise the range of the natural frequencies. The
explicit distribution of natural frequencies is not important, the key parameter is its width and in the SM we
obtain similar results when the natural frequencies are
drawn from a uniform random distribution. Initially, the
system is in a product state where N = 0, the transient
dynamics then causes the formation of entanglement and
anti-diagonal coherences which decay away at a rate set
by δ. We show how this entanglement forms [Figs. 5(cd)]: despite having mismatched frequencies and phases
the spins lock to an intermediate limit cycle with identical phase and frequency - which is twice the average
of the natural frequencies ω̄j (due to the factor of 2 in
Eq. (13)). The life-time of this cycle is large and as
δ → 0 diverges to infinity, evidenced by the tongue-like
behaviour seen in Figs. 5(a-b). These figures show how
the corresponding measures act as strong witnessess to
the synchronisation in the system - emphasizing its quantum nature.
The imaginary eigenmodes in Eq.
(3) are
translationally-invariant and hence the robust, synchronised behaviour observed [Fig. 5] is the result of a secondorder response to the detuning. The cross-sections included in Fig. 5b are evidence of this. At a given time
the coherences are well-approximated by a gaussian profile (see SM) as a function of the detuning. Meanwhile
at a given detuning the coherences decay away exponentially as a function of time, the decay rate d is proportional to the square of the detuning (see SM for numerical
evidence of this). Furthermore, we explicitly show this
non-linear scaling in Fig. 6. We calculate the shift in the
imaginary eigenvalues, |λ − λ(0) | (see Sec. (II C)) from
their original value λ(0) at δ = 0 as a function of the
detuning δ. There is no noticeable shift to first order in
δ - the fitted curve is proportional to δ 2 . Notably, the
highest imaginary eigenmode ρN
1,0 = |↑↑ ...i h↓↓ ...| is always unshifted, and remains imaginary regardless of the
distribution of natural frequencies.

Many-body synchronisation in the Hubbard
model

As our second example, we take the 1D N -site Hubbard model [36] in, potentially, disordered magnetic and
chemical fields. We focus on 1D lattices for numerical
tractability, nonetheless it should be emphasized that
these results are solely based on symmetry and thus can
be observed in any bi-partite d-dimensional realisation of

We then couple the system to a bath which induces
spin-agnostic dephasing on each site. Hence, the system’s time evolution can be described by the Lindblad

The case ωj = ω ∀j of this model was originally studied
in Ref. [25], where the existence of a strong dynamical
symmetry was shown to ensure long-time non-stationary
dynamics in this strongly-correlated system. A possible
experimental realisation of the system is also described
in this reference. In this section we show how, further
to this, perfect synchronisation is induced in the longtime dynamics of this model: alongside the strong dynamical symmetry there is an inter-site coupling and homogeneous local dephasing which ensure the long-time

dynamics is completely cooperative and translationally
invariant. Moreover, later in the section we break the
homogeneity of the magnetic field and demonstrate the
robustness of this synchronisation to perturbations away
from the dynamical symmetry regime.
Firstly, when ωj = ω ∀j, the magnetic field in Eq. (41)
breaks the spin SU(2) symmetry of the model: [H, S ± ] =
P †
ωS ± , [Lj , S ± ] = 0 ∀j, where S + =
j cj,↑ cj,↓ is the
global magnetic raising operator. Hence, there is a single
strong dynamical symmetry operator which can be used
to form the set of equidistant imaginary eigenmodes
ρnm ∝ (S + )n ρss (S − )m , Lρnm = iω(m − n)ρnm . (20)
These modes cause the existence of a persistent limit
cycles in the magnetisation (in the x and y directions)
of theQsystem. For example, by defining the operator
X = j∈B Sjx (where B = {a, b, c..} is a set of M sites
containing no duplicates) we can use Eq. (5) to prove
(see SM):
bM/2c

lim hXi(t) =

t→∞

X

Di cos ((2i + d) ωt) , d = M mod 2,

i=0

(21)
where the coefficients Di are set by the initial state of
the system. Due to the inter-site coupling and local dephasing the imaginary modes in Eq. (20) are completely
translationally symmetric (see Ref. [25] for the explicit
form of the steady state) and thus this observable is depent only on the cardinality M of the set B, not the
specific sites within the set.
As a result, even in the presence of disorder in the
chemical potential, the system displays perfectly synchronised magnetic oscillations in the long-time limit. This
will occur for a wide range of specific parameters and
initial states of the system, the only requirements are

that the appropriate coefficients, Di , are finite and the
hopping amplitude τ (which couples the different sites
together) is non-zero. Moreover, in the thermodynamic
limit, initial states which have limN →∞ hS x i/N 6= 0 will
ensure the long-time synchronised oscillations in hSjx i or
x
x
hSjS
Sj+1
i have a finite amplitude [25]. Similarly to the
previous example these oscillations are underpinned by
long-range correlations in the system which arise due to
the entangled nature of the long-time density matrix.
We demonstrate these features in the following numerics,
showing synchronisation in a fully many-body quantum
system.
In order to increase the system size accessible to our
numerical calculations, we have used a ‘quantum trajectories’ approach [37] to perform a stochastic unravelling
of Eq. (19) and simulate the dynamics at the level of an
ensemble of pure wavefunctions. Furthermore in Fig. 7,
as the simulation is only on a short time-scale, we were
able to use the time-evolving block decimation [38] algorithm on a Matrix Product State [39] decomposition
of the trajectory wavefunctions, further increasing the
available system size. These simulations were performed
with the aid of the Tensor Network Theory library [40].
In Fig. 7 we demonstrate the synchronicity which results from the eigenmodes in Eq. (20). We initialise
the system in a product state and, after quenching under the master Equation in Eq. (19) observe how the
x-magnetisation on each site synchronises perfectly, oscillating at the anticipated frequency. The Pearson coefficient for the magnetisation on any two sites saturates
to 1 in the long-time limit [Fig. 7(b)], with the dip at
tτ ≈ 2 being a transient effect which occurs at the first
turning point in the magnetisation.
We now perturb the system from the dynamical symmetry regime by setting the natural frequencies ωj to
be inhomogeneous, here we draw them from an evenly
spaced distribution, i.e. ωj+1 −ωj = const and ωN −ω1 =
2δ. Again, as for the spin-1 case, we choose this distribution for simplicity, our observations are independent
of the explicit distribution - the key parameter is its
width δ. We initialise the system in a specified state
and time-evolve under the Liouvillian in Eq. (19). In
Fig. 8 we show how, similarly to the previous spin-1 example, the system is still attracted to the synchronised
state, in both phase and frequency, on an intermediate
time-scale. There is a significant band of detunings where
the system stays in this long-lived synchronisation phase
(Figs. 8a and b) and the spin on each site locks to the
same phase and frequency (which is set by the average
frequency of the individual sites, see Fig. 8d). Remarkably, this harmonized response is occuring even in the
presence of both magnetic and chemical disorder - emphasizing the robustness of a symmetry-based approach
to observing quantum synchronisation. The imaginary
eigenmodes in Eq. (20) are translationally-invariant and
hence λ(1) evaluates to 0 (see Sec. II C). As with the
previous example, this robust, synchronised behaviour is
a result of a second-order response to the detuning.

The system is initialised in the state |ψ(0)i = |→↑→↑→i, which has no double occupancies, where →, ←, ↑ and ↓ correspond
to each site being polarised in the positive x, negative x, positive z and negative z directions respectively. The system is
then evolved in time with parameters γ = 2.0τ, U = 0.5τ and µj ∈ Rand[0, 0.2]τ where Rand[0, 0.2] is a uniformly-drawn
random number on the specified interval. The magnetic frequencies are uniformly distributed {ω1 , ω2 , ω3 , ω4 , ω5 } = {1.0 −

CONCLUSION

We have provided condtions which, when satisfied,
guarantee synchronisation in a generic qopen quatnum
system. We have then shown how, using a combination
of analytics and numerics, the interplay between interactions, local dephasing and a strong dynamical symmetry
can satisfy these conditions and facilitate the combination of entanglement and perfect phase synchronisation
between the individual constituents of the system. This
is a direct result of the formation, in the long-time limit,
of a well-defined phase relationship in the off-diagonal
coherences of the density matrix, at all length-scales of
the system. Furthermore, when perturbed from the dynamical symmetry regime these systems exhibit a secondorder response which results in both phase and frequency
locking throughout the system.
These observations orginate at the level of the symmetries of the system. Thus, we believe, this work marks
an important step in understanding how fully-quantum
synchronisation can originate in a wide range of generic
physical systems - as opposed to in a single delicately controlled setup. We anticipate further examples of complex
quantum networks where symmetry can guide the individual nodes into an entangled, fully synchronised state.
We highlight the potential role such a harmonised response can play in developing quantum technologies such
as atomic clocks and other metrological instruments which rely on quantum-enhanced synchronicity and cooperative behaviour in order to outperform their classical

counterparts [41, 42].
We also consider it pertinent to explore the role of
dynamical symmetries in synchronising closed, stronglycorrelated systems - where dissipation is absent. Recently, it was shown how the presence of a quasi-local
dynamical symmetry can prevent stationarity and guarantee oscillatory dynamics in the XXZ model [43].
Finally we note that strong dynamical symmetries are
also defined outside of this approximation [25] and so
we anticipate our results to be extendible beyond the
Markov regime. This will be particularly important for
understanding whether our results can be observed for
non-local dissipation: strongly interacting subsystems
are often not described by local master equations [44].

VI. PERTURBATION THEORY ON A
FREQUENCY DETUNED LIOUVILLIAN

We consider a general Liouvillian formed from the
Lindblad equation Lρ = −i[H, ρ] + D[ρ]. The Hamiltonian P
contains, amongst other terms, an inhomogeneous
field j ωj fj where fj is some local field operator. We
can split
Pthe Hamiltonian into two terms, a homogeneous
P
part:
j ω̄j fj and an inhomogeneous part:
j δj fj
where ωj = ω̄j + δj and ω̄j is the average natural frequency. We then, correspondingly, split the Liouvillian
into a perturbed and an unperturbed part, scaling by
1/ω̄j :

If the mode ρi is translationally invariant (i.e. it is

then we notice that the trace

j δj = 0 we then have

with δ̄j is the average over the set of detunings {δj }.
We work in superket and superbra form and assume
that the unperturbed Liouvillian L(0) contains a series of

λi = 0. Hence, for translationally-invariant imaginary
eigenmodes formed from a strong dynamical symmetry
we find that the system exhibits a non-linear response to
perturbations in the homogeneity of the natural frequencies. This underpins the strong-synchronised response of
the two systems considered in the main text.

IMAGINARY MODES AND STEADY

We also know that the orthonormality condition
hhσi |ρj ii = Tr(σi† ρj ) = δi,j must hold ∀ - where we have
defined σi and ρj as the matrix forms of the corresponding superket and superbras. Using this condition, to 0th

We start by proving that any state ρ = i=1
|mi i hmi |,
where |mi i is one of the Gm eigenvectors satisfying
S z |mi i = m |mi i, is a steady state: Lρ = 0. Firstly we
substitute ρss into Eq. (27) where it is easy to show that
z

[Sjz , |mi i hmi |] = [Sjz Sj+1

|mi i hmi |] = 0.

(29)

14
This can be done by considering the two spin-1s on the j
and j + 1 positions for a given |mi i. Then, we have that
−
Sj+ Sj+1
|mi i is a non-zero vector only if the two spin1s are in one of the configurations |0 ↑i , |00i , |↓↑i , |↓ 0i.
Because for these configurations swapping spins j + 1
and j doesn’t change the magnetisation m, we can always find the term |mi0 i hmi0 | in the steady state where
|mi0 i is just |mi i with spins j and j + 1 swapped. Equa−
tion (29) then follows from the fact Sj+ Sj+1
|mi i hmi | −
+ −
|mi0 i hmi0 | Sj Sj+1 = 0, i.e. for every term we can find a
corresponding term to cancel it with.
PGm
|mi i h−m0i | =
We can also show that L i=1
PGm

2imω i=1 |mi i h−mi |, where h−mi | is the ‘spinflipped’ bra for |mi i (i.e.
if |21 i = |0 ↑↑i

then
|−2
i
=
|0

Firstly,
it is clear that
1
P
[ j Sjz , |mi i h−m0i |] = 2m |mi i h−m0i |. Secondly, we also
z
have [Sjz Sj+1
, |mi i h−m0i |] = D[|mi i h−m0i |] = 0 ∀m, i, j.
Finally, by a very similar agument (the term with the
j and j + 1 spins swapped can always be found in
PGm
0
i=1 |mi i h−mi |) to the previous paragraph we find that
PG
m
0
|m i h−mi | satisfies Eq. (29) in the same manner
i=1
PGm i
as i=1 |mi i hmi |.
Hence we have another possible steady state:

L i=1
|0i i h00i | = 0 and so we can write the full steady
state as

Furthermore, the imaginary eigenmodes ρm

PGm

i=1 |mi i h−mi | m 6= 0, m = −N, ..., N , which we

proved satisfy Lρm
1,0 = 2inωρ1,0 , originate as a series of
strong dynamical symmetries [25] of the model because:
m
[H, ρm
1,0 ] = 2ωmρ1,0 ,

†
m
[Lk , ρm
1,0 ] = [Lk , ρ1,0 ] = 0 ∀k, m.
(32)

I.e. for this system the strong dynamical symmetry operators are the imaginary modes because they return themm
selves upon application to the steady state ρm
1,0 ρss ∝ ρ1,0
(the steady state is singular). Further application of the
strong dynamical symmetry operators is redundant as
m
ρm
1,0 ρ1,0 = 0. For the case when N > 2 and ∆ 6= 0 numerical calculations show that these 2N +2 steady states
and 2N imaginary modes completely span the kernel of
L and thus form a complete description of the system’s
dynamics in the limit t → ∞.

Noninteracting Solutions - The steady states and
strong dynamical symmetries described above provide a
complete basis for the long-time density matrix of the
system when ∆ 6= 0. When ∆ = 0 these solutions are
still valid (the derivations of the previous section are true
∀∆), however there exist additional solutions which are
not translationally invariant and therefore disrupt the
synchronicity of the system. This is because the system
z
is no longer interacting due to the absence of the Siz Si+1
+ −
term (in the z-basis the Si Si+1 terms only describe the
exchange of excitations through the lattice and do not
constitute interaction terms).
We now provide an example of one of these translationally invariant solutions. Specifically one can define
the operator
B=

N
X

(−1)i |↑↑ ... ↑i h↑↑ ... ↑| Si+ ,

(33)

i=1

and easily prove that
[H(∆ = 0), B] = 2B,
[Lj , B] = 0 ∀j,

[H(∆ 6= 0), B] 6= λB

λ ∈ R,
(34)

where H(∆) is the Hamiltonian in Eq. (28) as a function
of ∆. The first 2 relations in Eq. (34)
P are zbecause the
interaction term in the Hamiltonian j Siz Si+1
does not
commute with B whilst the hopping term does. Hence B
is only a valid dynamical symmetry operator when ∆ =
0. The operator B is clearly not translationally invariant
(even and odd sites are distinct) and so this interferes
with the perfect translational invariance of the solutions
derived earlier. Moreover, there are additional solutions
which break the translational invariance further. When
these solutions are excited by the initial state then the
synchronicity of the system is disrupted (see Fig. 3 of
the main text).

LONG-TIME DYNAMICS OF THE SPIN 1
CHAIN

As the imaginary modes ρm
1,0 contain coherences between the states |↑i and |↓i then they will only affect
the dynamics of quadratic observables such as (Sjx )2 and
(Sjy )2 . We can always write the long-time density matrix
as

state ρ(t = 0) and either the steady state ρss or the

imaginary modes ρm

consider the expectation value of the operator (Sjx )2 =

|m| ≥ 2 must contain at least two flipped spins between
the states |mi i and h−mi | then we immediately have

+ 2C1 cos(2ωt)Tr(ρ1 (Sjx )2 ),

(36)

where we have used the fact Tr(ρ−1 (Sjx )2 ) = Tr(ρ1 (Sjx )2 ).
Equation (36) proves the formation of clean, single frequency oscillations in the associated observable. Furthermore, the modes ρss and ρm
1,0 are all translationally
invariant and so the oscillations are identical for all spins:
ensuring perfect phase synchronisation.
In order to observe the excitement of higher order
modes we must measure higher order correlators. Specifically consider the operator
X=

(Sjx )2 ,

|{a, b, c, ..., }| = M,

(37)

j∈{a,b,c..}

where the set of M sites {a, b, c, ..., } contains no duplicates. Because we now have Tr(ρm

PARAMETRISING THE CROSS-SECTIONS
OF THE FREQUENCY-DETUNED SPIN-1

In the main text we considered the response of the
system when the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, i.e.
the system’s dynamics is modelled by Eq. (27) with the
Hamiltonian now of the form

where the ωj are a series of natural frequencies associated with each spin j. We then considered how, for a
given range of natural frequencies, synchronisation wit||ρTj ||−1

time. For the example in the main text we considered N = 3 with the natural frequencies equally spaced
{ω1 , ω2 , ω3 } = {1−δ, 1, 1+δ}J, which produced the maps
in Fig. 9(a-b), showing the witnesses as a function of time
and detuning.
We now parametrise the cross-sections in Fig. 9(b).
In Fig. 9(c) we show how, at a given time, and for sufficiently small detunings, the off-diagonal coherences C
are well-described by a Gaussian curve as a function of
the detuning. Furthermore, in Fig. 9(d) we calculate
the decay coefficient (for the exponential decay of the
off-diagonal coherences C versus time) versus δ and show
how, for small detunings, d ∝ δ 2 . In Figs. 9(c-d) the tails
of the distribution aren’t captured by this parametrisation due to numerical precision (both synchronisation
quantities are very close to 0 for large detunings). This
parametrisation also holds for the cross-sections of the
average negativity N̄j in Fig. 9(b).

where [0, δ] is a uniform random distribution over the specified interval. The Synchronisation measures are then averaged over

X. FURTHER PLOTS OF THE
FREQUENCY-DETUNED SPIN-1 CHAIN

In Figure 5 of the main text we showed how, when
the natural frequencies of the spins in the chain are
inhomogeneous, the system still locks to a long-lived,
synchronised cycle with a frequency which is the average of their natural frequencies. This response emerges
as a tongue-like profile in the witnesses C and N̄j as a
function of detuning δ and time. In the main text, for
simplicity, we considered the case where {ω1 , ω2 , ω3 } =
{1.0 − δ, 1.0, 1.0 + δ}, i.e. the natural frequencies form a
uniform sequence. Here, in Fig. 10, we show that this distribution is arbitrary, showing how similar tongues and
cross-sections emerge when the natural frequencies are
drawn from a uniform random distribution of width δ.
The spins are able to lock to an intermediate cycle with
a frequency which is twice the average of the natural frequencies ω̄j .

(42)
where ρss is a grand-canonical-like state containing the
strong-symmetries of the system [25, 28, 31] and ρ†n,m =

can be written as

with Yn,n−1 = Tr Sjx ρn,n−1 = Tr Sjx ρn−1,n . Hence,
we see persistent oscillations in Sjx , which are centred
around the x-axis. The modes ρn,m are completely translationally invariant and thus the spins on each site will
synchronise to limit cycles perfectly in phase, regardless
of the initial state. We can immediately treat higher order modes through the operator
Y
Sjx ,
X=
|{a, b, ...}| = M,

j∈{a,b,..}

where the set of M sites {a, b, c, ..., } contains no duplicates. We can calculate the expectation value of this
operator by expanding it in terms of raising and lowering operators and using the fact the trace of each term
is only non-vanishing if the difference between the number of raising and lowering operators is equal to |m − n|.
Thus, we get
