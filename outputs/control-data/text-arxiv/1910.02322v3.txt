The mass to luminosity ratio of the dwarf satellite galaxies in the Milky Way suggests that these
dwarf galaxies may contain substantial dark matter. The dark matter at the dense region such
as within or at the vicinity of the centres of these dwarf galaxies may undergo the process of self
annihilation and produce γ-rays as the end product. The satellite borne γ-ray telescope such as
Fermi-LAT reported the detection of γ-rays from around 45 Dwarf Spheroidals (dSphs) of Milky
Way. In this work, we consider particle dark matter models described in the literature and after
studying their phenomenologies, we calculate the γ-ray fluxes from the self annihilation of the dark
matter within the framework of these models in case of each of these 45 dSphs. we then compare
the computed results with the observational upper bounds for γ-ray flux reported by Fermi-LAT
and Dark Energy Survey (DES) for each of the 45 dSphs. The fluxes are calculated by adopting
different dark matter density profiles. We then extend similar analysis for the observational upper
bounds given by Fermi-LAT for the continuum γ-ray fluxes originating from extragalactic sources.

I. INTRODUCTION

Although the existence of dark matter (DM) in the Universe is now well established, any direct signature of the
dark matter is still eluding the worldwide endeavours at different direct dark matter search experiments. The indirect
search for dark matter involves detection of the known Standard Model (SM) particles that can be produced by
possible dark matter annihilation (or decay) in cosmos. Although the cosmic relics, the dark matter can undergo
self annihilation if it is accumulated in considerable magnitude by being captured, under the influence of gravity,
inside massive astrophysical bodies. In literature there are indications that the emissions of excess γ-rays from the
Galactic Centre (GC) region (detected by Fermi-LAT satellite borne experiment) could have been originated from
the annihilation of dark matter at GC region. The dwarf spheroidals are the satellite galaxies to the Milky Way and
they fail to grow as matured galaxies. These dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are generally of low luminosities and
contain population of older stars with little dust. The dwarf spheroidals could be very rich in dark matter. These
galaxies would have been tidally disrupted but the presence of dark matter provides the necessary gravitational pull.
The existence of dark matter in dwarf spheroidals can also be realised by studying their mass to luminosity ratios.
From several observations
the estimated mass to luminosity ratios (M/L) are found to be much more than the same

for the sun M
.
The
dark
matter at dSphs can undergo self annihilation and produce γ-rays.
L
The Fermi-LAT satellite borne observations and Dark Energy Survey (DES) have reported the upper bounds of
the γ-ray spectra for several dwarf galaxies [3, 6]. Here in this work, we consider two particle dark matter models
(one is the simple extension of Standard Model and the other is inspired by a Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theory
of particle physics) and for the dark matter candidates in each of these two models, we compute the expected γ-ray
flux from all the 45 dSphs mentioned above by considering the dark matter annihilations at those dSphs. These
computed results are then compared with the observational upper bounds for γ-ray flux for each of the 45 dSphs.
The Fermi-LAT experiment also provides [1, 4] the observational results for extragalactic γ-ray flux. If the γ-rays
(or a component of that) also originate from dark matter annihilation, then this too could be indirect signal of dark
matter. The dark matter annihilation to γ-rays in extragalactic source is considered to add to the extragalactic γ-ray
flux. To this end, we compute the extragalactic γ-ray flux from other possible sources such as GRB, BL Lacs etc. and
add to them the possible contribution to extragalactic γ-rays from dark matter annihilations (within the framework
of the dark matter models considered in this work). We then compare the sum total flux with Fermi-LAT results.
The first (Model I) of the two models are chosen based on the following considerations. It has been shown earlier,
in the context of explaining the observed excess in Galactic Centre γ-ray signal within the energy range of around 2-8
GeV, that this excess can be well explained from the annihilation of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle)
dark matter of mass in the range of tens of GeV [10, 12, 28, 29] which annihilates principally to bb̄ as primary products
with the dark matter annihilation cross-section hσvi (v represents the velocity of dark matter) in the ball park of
10−26 cm3 s−1 . The first model for particle dark matter considered in this word is inspired by Dutta Banik et al. [24].
It has been demonstrated [24] that the WIMP dark matter component of this first model (describe later) satisfies
these criteria along with the criteria for dark matter relic density given by Planck satellite borne experiment [49] based
on the observation and analysis of the anisotropies of Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR). This has
also been shown in Dutta Banik et al. [24] that the WIMP component (of mass ∼ 50 GeV) in their two component
dark matter model (adopted here as Model I) can well explain the observed Galactic Centre γ-ray fluxes observed by
Fermi-LAT from this region. The dark mater candidate in the second model (Model II) adopted here is inspired by
an established beyond Standard Model (BSM) theory namely theory of universal extra dimension [18].This has been
shown by [37, 53], that the dark matter mass in this model should be around 900 GeV in order that calculated relic
density for such a dark matter in this model satisfies Planck relic density results. Being in a mass regime higher than
that for the dark matter candidate in Model I, the γ ray spectrum originated from this dark matter annihilation will
have a wider energy range and thus raises the possibility of exploring the whole energy range given by the Fermi-LAT
observed results for the upper bound of the γ-ray flux from all the 45 dwarf galaxies considered in this work. The
same particle dark matter formalism is then adopted for the extragalactic γ-ray case.
The first (Model I) of the two particle dark matter models mentioned above is a two component dark matter model
(obtained by minimal extension of Standard Model) where one component is a Feebly Interacting Massive particle
or FIMP (we have denoted FIMP as FImP for being less massive) and the other component is a Weakly Interacting
Massive Particle or WIMP. The model is proposed and its phenomenology is elaborately worked out in an earlier
work involving two of the present authors (Ref. [24]). While the FImP component of this two component dark
matter model could explain the phenomena such as dark matter self interactions, the WIMP component was useful in
explaining the excess γ-rays from GC region when they annihilate mainly into bb̄ to finally produce γ-rays. The model
is constructed by minimal extension of Standard Model with a Dirac fermion χ, a real scalar S and a pseudoscalar
φ. While the fermion χ and the scalar S are singlets under SM gauge group, the fermion has an additional U(1)DM
charge. This prevents the fermion χ to interact with SM fermions ensuring stability. A Z2 symmetry is imposed on the
scalar S. The Lagrangian is CP invariant but the CP invariance is broken when the pseudoscalar φ acquires a vacuum

3
expectation value (vev). On the other hand, the scalar develops a vev when the Z2 symmetry is spontaneously broken.
Thus after spontaneous breaking of the symmetries (SU(2)L × U(1)Y , Z2 , CP), the scalars in the theory namely the
Higgs H, S and φ acquire vev and their real components mix together. Three mass eigen states h1 , h2 and h3 are
obtained (small mixing angles, θ12 ∼ 10−2 , θ13 ∼ 10−13 and θ23 ∼ 10−15 ) after diagonalisation of mass matrix while
eigen state h1 is identified with the physical Higgs with mass 125.5 GeV, h2 is identified with the pseudo scalar
considered in the model. Since h1 is identified with SM Higgs, one requires to consider the collider bounds for the
limit on R1 (SM Higgs signal strength) which is expressed as the ratio of total decay width of the SM Higgs and the
1
calculated total decay width of h1 . One also requires to consider invisible decay branching ratio (Brinv
) of SM like
Higgs h1 and this parameter is fixed using collider constrains. The lightest mass eigenstate after diagonalisation (with
small mixing with other scalars) is taken to be the FImP candidate. But in this work, in order to calculate the γ-rays
from the annihilation of dark matter in each of the chosen 45 dwarf galaxies (as also the extragalactic γ-ray case), the
WIMP component which is the Dirac singlet fermion (in this WIMP-FImP model) is useful. The WIMP candidate in
this model interacts with SM sector through Higgs portal. In Ref. Dutta Banik et al. [24], this has been shown that
the excess γ-rays from the Galactic Centre within the energy range 2 GeV - 8 GeV as reported by Fermi-LAT can be
well explained by the WIMP component (fermion χ) of this WIMP-FImP model if the WIMPs (χ) self annihilate to
bb̄ which in turn produces secondary γ-rays. The cross-section for the channel χχ → bb̄ is calculated and computed in
Ref. Dutta Banik et al. [24] for certain model benchmark points. The computations of annihilation cross-section of
the process χχ → bb̄ require the coupling and other factors (the expression for this cross-section is given in Appendix
of Dutta Banik et al. [24]) to be determined by constraining the model interaction lagrangian with theoretical bounds
as well as experimental bounds and collider bounds. The process χχ → bb̄ is mediated by the scalar h1 and h2 and
one needs the coupling ‘g’ of the pseudo scalar (h2 ) with the dark matter fermion χ as also the other couplings of
χ with h1 . The coupling g is a parameter in this model (the expression of the couplings of the fermions with Higgs
are known). Again since Model I is two component dark matter model (the WIMP component of which is considered
here (similar to what is considered in Dutta Banik et al. [24])), the fraction of WIMP component χ that contributes
to generate required Galactic Centre γ-ray excess in Dutta Banik et al. [24] is denoted by fχ . The annihilation
cross-section hσviχχ→bb̄ will also be weighted by this fraction fχ . Thus fχ is also a parameter of the model. The
allowed ranges of all these parameters are obtained by constraining the model interaction lagrangian with theoretical
(unitarity, perturbativity etc.) as well as experimental constraints (e.g. PLANCK relic density results) and collider
constraints. In Ref. Dutta Banik et al. [24] the several benchmark values of model parameters are given for computing
the Galactic Centre γ-ray excess and comparing with the Fermi-LAT results for the same. In the present work, we
adopt one of such benchmark point and compute the γ-ray fluxes for all the 45 dSphs by similar consideration of
annihilation of the WIMP component χ (of the two component model discussed above) to bb̄ and compare them with
upper bounds of all those 45 dSphs given by Fermi-LAT experiment [3, 6]. This benchmark point (set of values of
the parameters) are shown in Table I. The astrophysical J -factor values required to compute the fluxes are obtained
from different observational groups for the dwarf galaxies.
The other particle dark matter candidate considered in this work is from a BSM theory and this candidate is
Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter (Model II) inspired by the theories of extra dimensions [18, 30, 37, 53]. If only one
spatial extra dimension is considered and this extra dimension is compactified over a circle of compactification radius
R, say, then the effective four dimensional theory as obtained by integrating the extra spatial dimension over the
periodic coordinate ((y → y + 2πR), compactification over a circle), gives rise to a tower of Kaluza-Klein modes with
mass of each mode given by mk = k/R, where k is called the Kaluza-Klein number or KK number. As KK number
is associated with the quantized momentum in compactified dimension (E 2 = p2 + m2k ), the KK number is conserved
and hence the Lightest Kaluza-Klein particle or LKP is stable and can be a candidate for dark matter.
In this work, we consider a KK dark matter candidate in an extra dimensional model namely Universal Extra
Dimensional model (UED) [8, 18, 34, 53]. In this model, each of the SM field can propagate in the extra dimension
and every SM particle has a KK tower. But since the SM fermions are chiral, in order to obtain chiral KK counterpart
of the SM fermions in UED model, the compactification of the extra dimension is to be made over a S 1 /Z2 orbifold
(instead of compactifying just over a circle S 1 with compactification radius R) where a reflection symmetry Z2 is
imposed under which the extra coordinate y → −y and the fields are even or odd. Thus the chirality of a fermion
can be identified in the extra dimension. The orbifold has now two boundary points at 0 and πR. But this breaks
translational symmetry in the y direction and the KK momentum is no more conserved. Therefore the KK number
(k) is also not conserved and the LKP is no more stable. But, for the transformation y → y + πR, the KK modes
remain invariant for even KK number but odd KK modes change sign. Thus we have a quantity called (−1)KK - the
KK parity - which is a good symmetry for this transformation and hence conserved. The conservation of KK parity
ensures LKP in UED model is stable. In the present work, the LKP dark matter candidate in UED model is the first
KK partner B 1 of the hypercharge gauge boson.
We have taken a range of masses for the chosen KK dark matter candidate B 1 and demonstrate how well the γ-rays
produced from the annihilation of such a dark matter candidate agrees with the observational results for all the dwarf

galaxies considered. The range of masses for these KK particles are so chosen that the PLANCK limits for the dark
matter relic densities are satisfied. For continuum γ signal from B 1 B 1 annihilation one needs to consider the channel
B 1 B 1 −→ qq (q denotes the quarks). The annihilation cross-sections (hσqq vi) for this channel are calculated following
[18]. It is to be noted that the interaction coupling for the process B 1 B 1 → qq is computable for a given mass of the
dark matter candidate B 1 [18]. The only parameter here is the mass of q 1 which is the first KK partner of quark q
mq1 − mB 1
in the UED model. The parameter is rewritten as r =
, where, mq1 , mB 1 are the masses of q 1 and B 1
mB 1
respectively. In this work, we have varied parameter r in such a way that mB 1 is in the allowed mass range (discussed
earlier) and mq1 > mB 1 is maintained. We do not find any significant changes in the result.
We then extend our analyses for extragalactic γ-rays also. The observed extragalactic γ-ray signal may contain the
component of γ-ray from dark matter annihilations at extragalactic sources ([11, 27, 44, 56, 58, 59]. The extragalactic
γ-rays can have many components other than those possibly from dark matter annihilations. There are attempts to
extract dark matter annihilation signals from the extragalactic γ-ray background or EGB [2, 5, 15, 19, 21, 22, 52, 57].
The possible contribution to the EGB may come from BL Lac objects, millisecond pulsars, radio galaxies etc. More
detailed knowledge and their possible contribution to the EGB not only helps to look for any such dark matter
annihilation signals beyond the EGB but also is useful to put stringent bound on dark matter annihilation crosssections. With both the particle dark matter models considered here, we have made an attempt in this work to
estimate whether any significant signal from the dark matter annihilation can be obtained from extragalactic sources.
For the extragalactic also, the same benchmark points given in Table I and Table III are used.
In an earlier work ([39]), similar analyses have been performed. But in that analyses only 18 dSphs were considered
with inert doublet dark matter but in the preset analyses we take into account as many as 45 dSphs. Also, in this
work, two dark matter models are considered under which one dark matter candidate is the Higgs portal component
of a two component DM ([24]) while the other is a particle dark matter inspired by theories of extra dimensions
([18, 30, 37, 53]).
The paper is organised as follows. In Sect. II we give the formalism to calculate γ-ray flux. Sect. III deals with the
observational data, the calculations and results for the dwarf galaxies and the comparison of the computed results
with observational bounds. The calculational procedures for the estimation of extra galactic γ-ray background and
the contribution from possible dark matter annihilation are given in Sect. IV. Finally in Sect. V we conclude with a
summary and some remarks.

II. FORMALISM FOR γ-RAY FLUX CALCULATIONS IN CASE OF DWARF GALAXIES FROM DARK MATTER
ANNIHILATION

The observed flux from cosmic dark matter source depends significantly on the dark matter annihilation crosssection hσvi [3] as well as the total DM contained within the solid angle subtended by the source at the observer (the
astrophysical J -factor). Analytically the J -factor can be calculated as
Z

ρ(r)2 ds = r ρ2 J.

J =

l.o.s

In the above, ρ (0.3 GeV/cm3 ) is the dark matter density at the distance r (8.33 kpc) from the Galactic Centre
(at the solar system). In the above equation, J represents the dimensionless form of J -factor given by,

and rs is a characteristic scale distance. In this case rs = 20 kpc for dwarf galaxy calculations. The radial distance r

As mentioned earlier, we have considered two particle dark matter models in this work. One is a two component
WIMP-FImP model where the WIMP component χ of mass around 50 GeV (Table I) contributes to γ-rays (Model
I) by their self annihilation (via a Higgs portal) leading primarily to bb̄. The expression of the cross-section for
the process χχ −→ bb̄ is given in the Appendix of [24]. The annihilation cross-section is computed to be hσvi =
1.62×10−26 cm3 sec−1 . The computations of annihilation cross-section require numerical values of the various couplings
involved in different interactions. These couplings are the particle dark matter model parameters and are discussed
in Dutta Banik et al. [24]. In Table I we furnish a set of benchmark values taken from the allowed region of these
parameters discussed in Dutta Banik et al. [24]. The set of values of the couplings is used in present work. It is
to be noted that, these coupling parameters are in agreement with the bounds and the constraints coming from the
theoretical considerations such as vacuum stability conditions, perturbativity and unitarity conditions etc. and they
also satisfy the various bounds given by the experimental observations, e.g., the collider physics bounds (LHC bounds),
the PLANCK observational results for the dark matter relic density and the upper limit on the dark matter - nucleon
scattering cross-section obtained from different dark matter direct detection experiments. All the above mentioned
constraints and bounds imposed on the model parameters (such as various interaction couplings etc.) which are
necessary in order to compute the annihilation cross-section for the channel χχ → bb̄, have been elaborately discussed
in [24]. The parameters in Table I are within the allowed range of model parameter space and they also respect all
the necessary constraints and bounds. Same set of coupling parameter value and the same formalism are adopted for
extragalactic case also.
The other is a KK dark matter (B 1 ) in an extra dimensional model (Model II) having a mass of about 900 GeV
(Table III) which self annihilates to the primary product qq and yields γ-rays as the end product. For the case of B 1
dark matter, the annihilation cross-section B 1 B 1 −→ qq is computed from the expression [18]

mass while θW is the Weinberg angle. The mass mqL1 are fixed by defining a parameter r = (mq1 − mB 1 )/mB 1 ([18])
and then adopting a suitable value for r. It is also to be noted that the LKP dark matter candidate B 1 in this case is
the first KK partner of the hypercharge gauge boson. It is seen that the mass of this dark matter candidate should
be ∼900 GeV for its relic density to satisfy the PLANCK result [49]. In the limit in which electroweak symmetry
breaking (EWSB) is neglected, there will be no channels with vector gauge bosons as primary products and only 2%
of the annihilation goes into Higgs [53]. Moreover [18] shows that the channel B 1 B 1 → e+ e− yields narrow peaks
for positrons and for computation of continuum photon signal the relevant annihilation cross-section is hσqq vi. The
choice of dark matter masses in both the models are shown in Table III. Same formalism of dark matter annihilation
with same dark matter mass is adopted for the extragalactic γ-ray flux calculations.
The γ fluxes are calculated (for the chosen dark matter candidates) by computing the J factor with each of the
three density profiles of Table II. The fluxes are also computed with the J factors estimated and published by other
groups [13, 46]. These density profiles are plotted in Fig. 1.

THE γ-RAY FLUX CALCULATIONS FOR THE DWARF GALAXIES AND THEIR COMPARISON WITH THE
OBSERVATIONS

DM rich dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) have turned out to be important cosmological sites to probe and understand the nature of dark matter and its astrophysical implications. The satellite observations by Fermi-LAT [9] as
well as later Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Fermi-LAT collaboration reveal a sum of 45 dwarf spheroidal galaxies in
the energy range 0.5 ∼ 500 GeV [3]. The details of these dSphs are furnished in Table IV. In Table IV the J factors
and their uncertainties are also given for those 45 dSphs. These Fermi-LAT observations upper bounds are obtained
from [3, 6]. The upper bounds of γ-ray fluxes from those dSphs are given in Fig. 2.
In the present work we have estimated γ-flux for all of those 45 dSphs tabulated in Table IV assuming that the dark
matter in those dSphs annihilate to produce γ. The computations for γ flux for each of the two DM candidates have
been performed following Eqs. (1) - (5). The DM candidates and models as also the chosen DM masses are already
discussed and in Table III the benchmark mass points are given. Note that the cross-section given in Eq. 5 is for KK
dark matter only (Model II).
Figs. 2 and 3 show upper bound of γ-ray flux given by the Fermi-LAT observation as well as the computed γ-ray
flux for the two particle dark matter candidates. In Figs. 2 and 3 the upper bound of the γ-ray flux for all the 45
galaxies (as given by Fermi-LAT collaboration) are shown with green arrows pointing downwards. Integrated J -factor
over a solid angle of ∆Ω = 2.4 × 10−4 sr (field of view of Fermi-LAT ∼ 0.5o ) are measured from stellar kinematics
data. The numerical values of J -factor for all dSphs (obtained from observational data) are tabulated in Table IV.
The computations of flux for the DM candidates in both the models are made as follows. Integrated J -factor over
a solid angle of ∆Ω = 2.4 × 10−4 sr (field of view of Fermi-LAT ∼ 0.5o ) are measured from stellar kinematics data.
The numerical values of J -factor for all dSphs (obtained from observational data) as well as the flux estimations
for the case of both the models I and II using the J -factors are tabulated in Table IV. The flux estimations for the
case of both the Models I and II are first made using the J factors given in Table IV. The spread of each of these
calculated fluxes due to the uncertainties of the J factors (given in Table IV) are also calculated in case of each of the
two dark matter models considered. The fluxes and their spreads thus estimated with both the DM candidates for all
the 45 dSphs are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The γ flux for DM in Model I (WIMP component χ with mass ∼50 GeV
of two component WIMP-FImP model) are shown by a black line (for the central values of J in Table IV) and the
estimated spread of these computed fluxes due to uncertainties in corresponding J values are shown by yellow bands
in each of the 45 plots (for 45 dwarf galaxies) spreaded over Figs. 2 and 3. Similar estimations of the γ flux and their
uncertainties for the DM candidate B 1 (KK dark matter from extra dimensional model with mass ∼900 GeV; Model
II) are shown with blue central lines with uncertainty spreads shown in pink in each of the 45 plots (of Figs. 2 and 3).
The fluxes are also estimated for both the dark matter candidates (Model I and Model II) following Eqs. 1-4 by
explicitly computing the J with each of the three dark matter density profiles given in Table II. These are NFW,
Einasto and Burkert DM density profiles. They are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 in red, black and blue dashed lines
respectively for the WIMP dark matter in Model I and in red, black and blue dotted lines for the KK dark matter of
Model II. It can be seen that for most of the cases, the results using NFW profiles almost coincide with those using
Einasto profile while distinction can be made for the flux results with Burkert profile. This may be understood from
the natures of the profiles (Fig. 1). While both NFW and Einasto profiles are cuspy in nature, the Burkert profile is
flat and isothermal in nature. Also Burkert profile has been used earlier to analyse the dwarf galaxy rotation curves
([17, 35]).
It appears from Figs. 2 and 3 that for Model I (the WIMP component of a WIMP-FImP model) with all the three
density profiles, the fluxes are below the observational upper limits of all the 45 dSphs. Similar results for the KK
dark matter in Model II (the Kaluza-Klein model) are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 with colour codes mentioned above. It
can be seen that KK dark matter also respects the observational upper bounds of all the dSphs γ-fluxes considered
here. Moreover, it can also be seen form Figs. 2 and 3 that wider range (in comparison to what obtained in case of
Model I) of γ-ray flux can be achieved when KK dark matter (Model II) is considered.

IV. EXTRAGALACTIC γ-RAY BACKGROUND AND EXTRAGALACTIC γ-RAYS FROM DARK MATTER
ANNIHILATIONS

In this section, we compute the defused extragalactic γ-ray flux from dark matter annihilation and compared with
different possible backgrounds. Here we like to mention that, the saying models (Model I and Model II as described
earlier) are adopted for particle dark matter candidate and the same set of model parameter values given in Table I and
Table III re used for computing the dark matter annihilation cross-section in extragalactic case also. The γ-ray flux
from dark matter annihilation could have extragalactic origins too and probing such γ-rays could be effective not only
for indirect detection of extragalactic DM but also to understand their origins [7, 11, 27, 44, 45, 48, 56, 58, 59]. But
whether such γ-ray signals can be identified by terrestrial telescopes depend on the background γ-rays from different
other types of extragalactic sources. Therefore, to study the γ-rays from extragalactic dark matter annihilation, one
needs to estimate the flux from other possible sources that can contribute to the backgrounds for such observations.
In order to explore the possibilities that γ-ray signals from the extragalactic dark matter annihilations (indirect DM
signals) could be detected with significance, we also compute the γ-ray signals from other possible non-DM origins of
extragalactic γ-rays. Such non-DM origins include BL Lac objects, quasars, pulsars, Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) etc.
For many of these sources, the natures of spectra are found to follow roughly a power law. A list of such sources and
the corresponding γ-ray flux (power law or other forms) from these sources are furnished later in Table V.
The satellite borne experiment namely Fermi-LAT furnished their observed results for extragalactic γ-ray flux. In
this section, we compute the sum of the γ-rays from extragalactic DM annihilations (for each of the DM candidate in
Model I and Model II) and from other possible non-DM sources. We then compare our results with those observed
by Fermi-LAT [1, 4].
The rate of photons emitted from volume element dV from the sky depends on several factors mainly the halo mass
dN
function dn/dM as a function of mass M and redshift z, the differential photon energy spectrum dEγ (E, M, z), the
−τ
attenuation factor (e ) of the extragalactic γ-rays etc. The rate of photons emitted from volume element dV having

originated as the end product of the dark matter annihilation. Therefore computation of dark matter cross-section
dN
is important for the calculation of dEγ . The extragalactic γ-rays produced at a redshift z suffers attenuation during
its passage through intergalactic medium. This attenuation of extragalactic γ-ray is due to the absorption of high
energy γ-rays by extragalactic background light (EBL). Detailed studies for this attenuation are given in Cirelli et al.
[20] and Fig. 4 is generated following Cirelli et al. [20]. This attenuation can be described by an exponential function
in terms of the optical depth τ as e−τ (z,E0 ) , E0 being the energy at detection at z = 0. The optical depth is related
to the pair production of baryonic matter, photon-photon scattering in ambient photon background radiation (PBR)
and photon-photon pair production [20]. In Fig. 4 we have shown the dependence of the attenuation factor on redshift
(z) and the energy E0 at detection (z = 0).
The PBR depends on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the intergalactic stellar light and the secondary
Infrared (IR) radiation. The Ultraviolet (UV) background can be originated from intergalactic stellar light. These
stellar light may come from the massive and hot stars that were ignited at very low redshift. The two models of UV
background are generally used for the background estimation. One is the “no UV” case where the contribution of the
UV is absent, while the other is “relativistic UV”. The latter has been considered in blazar study and it prescribed a

certain value for the UV background proton density. But this value is lower than the values estimated in many of the
other earlier analyses [26]. In this work, a significant amount of contribution of the UV background has been taken
into account as described in [23, 26]. The diffuse extragalactic γ-ray flux due to DM annihilation is written as,

dn
the density parameter for matter (M ) or dark energy (Λ) or curvature (k). The halo mass function dM
is expressed

in terms of the fluctuation, the overdensity in structure formation etc. Denoting σ (M ) to be the variance of the
linear density field (rms density = σ) the mass function f (σ) extrapolated to redshift z can be written following

This expression arises out of the following assumption. After smoothening the linear density perturbations over a mass
scale M , if in a fraction of space this smooth density field exceeds a threshold δc then this fraction of space collapses
with mass greater than M . This δc is called critical overdensity for collapse 1 . In other word, this is the critical value
of initial overdensity that is required for collapse at z. This mass function f is also written in terms of a quantity ν
where ν (= δc /σ) is the overdensity in units of rms density σ. The ratio ν is related to mean square mass fluctuation
σ 2 (M ) that is also caused by the non-linear growth of fluctuation. The distribution f (ν) is the distribution of mass
dn
in isolated halos at a given epoch and is related to number densities of halos 2 . The mass density function dM
(M, z)
is written as [50],

spectrum is parameterized as P (k) ∝ k n T 2 (k) where n is the spectral index and T is a transfer function related to the
DM and baryon density in the Universe. Cosmic microwave background data will be useful for its computation. In
Fig. 5a we show the variation of P (k) with wave number k for different z values. We also compute how the variance
σ varies with halo mass M . These variations are plotted in Fig. 5b for the same set of z values as in Fig. 5a. The

model [55] with redshift z and the halo mass M . Note that, Fig. 4 is just a demonstrative plot for the variation
of optical depth with energy and redshift. In order to generate this demonstrative plot, all the necessary numerical
calculations have been executed by performing HMFcalc [40] code.
According to the ΛCDM cosmological model, the DM halos are formed in the bottom-up sequence. In this approach,
initially the small clumps of matter forms in the presence of a tiny density fluctuation zones having a very high
gravitational impact. This small scale structures grow into the larger ones, eventually forming the larger scale
structures like the DM halos. The DM density profile of a DM halo as per the suggestion of the N-body simulation
can be written as ρ(r) = ρ(s)g(r/rs ), where rs and ρs indicate the scale radius and the scale density for a particular
halo model respectively. For the halo profile we have chosen NFW halo profile [41, 42] depending on which we can
explain the nature of the function g(r/rs ) (NFW halo profile has been mentioned in Table II). The mass of any DM
halo contained within the radius rh is given as
Mh = 4πρs rh3 f (rs /rh ),

(14)

where f (x) = x3 [ln(1 + x)−1 − (1 + x)−1 ]. The NFW profile has two parameters namely a characteristic inner radius
rs and a characteristic inner density ρs [60]. One of these characteristic parameter can be replaced by virial radius or
virial mass where, virial mass Mvir is
Mh = Mvir =

(15)

where ∆vir ρ̄(z) is the mean density in the virial radius Rvir and ∆vir is the critical over density at virialisation. In
the above, ρ̄(z) is the mean Universal density. For the flat Universe (Ωk = 0), ∆vir (z) takes the form [16]

The γ-ray energy spectrum dN
dE depends on the halo profile which is taken to be NFW profile in the present
calculations. The shape of the profile can be alternatively described in terms of a concentration parameter. As the
name suggests this parameter is about the concentration of matter in the halo at different positions and hence is an
effective alternative for the description of the shape of the halo density profile. In general, the concentration parameter

Two forms for concentration parameter cvir are adopted for the present computation of extragalactic γ-ray flux.
2/3
The first form is cvir (M, z) = k200 (H(zf (M ))/H(z))
from Macciò et al.[36] with k200 ' 3.9, H(z) = H(z)/H0
and zc (M ) is the effective redshift when a halo with mass M is formed. The second form cvir (M, z) = 6.5 H(z)−2/3
(M/M∗ )−0.1 , M∗ = 3.37 × 1012 h−1 M follows from a power law model ( [36, 43]). In what follows we refer this second
form for Cvir as “Power law model for Cvir ” while the former form for Cvir as “Macciò et al. model for Cvir ”. The dark
matter substructure within a halo may form bound subhalos. The minimum mass for such subhalos are denoted by
Mmin . This minimum mass Mmin for such subhalos are determined from the decoupling temperature of dark matter.
Two values of minimum subhalo mass namely Mmin = 10−6 M and 10−9 M [14, 38] are chosen.
We use Eqs. 6-20 to compute the extragalactic γ-ray flux (Eq. 18) induced by annihilation of dark matter. As
mentioned, in order to explore the possibilities that the extragalactic γ-rays could be indirect dark matter signal,
the calculations are performed for each of the two particle dark matter candidates followed from the two particle
dark matter models considered in this work (similar to what has been described in Section III for the case pf dwarf
galaxies). We mention here that for the dark matter models, we adopt exactly the same framework and the numerical
values of the parameters (such as couplings) as used for the computation related to the γ-ray fluxes of the dwarf
galaxies described in Section II. While one is a 50 GeV dark matter − the WIMP component of a two component
WIMP-FImP dark matter model (Model I) the other (Model II) is a 900 GeV Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter inspired
by extra dimensional models (see Section I).
We also estimate the background flux from different possible extragalactic astrophysical sources. The diffuse γ-ray
background may include contributions from BL Lacertea objects (BL Lacs), flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs),
millisecond pulsars (MSPs), star forming galaxy (SFG), Fanarof-Riley (FR) radio galaxies of type I (FRI) and type II
(FRII), ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), γ-ray bursts (GRBs), star burst galaxy (SBG), ultra high energy
protons interacting with the inter-cluster material (UHEp ICM) and gravitationally induced shock waves (IGS). These
along with the nature of their empirical nature (power spectra [57]) are tabulated in Table V.
The sum total of the calculated γ-ray flux and the background in case of two dark matter models considered are
shown in Figs. 6-9. While the computed results with Model I are given in Figs. 6-7, in Figs. 8-9 we plot the results for
Model II. In all the figures, however the extragalactic backgrounds from each of the possible non-DM sources (Table V)
are shown. The results computed with each of the two chosen values of minimum subhalo mass (Mmin = 10−6 M and
Mmin = 10−9 M ) are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 for the case of Model I and in Fig. 8 and Fig.9 when computations
are made for the KK dark matter (Model II).
In all the Figs. 6-9, the sum total of the computed extragalactic γ-ray flux (assumed to have originated from dark
matter annihilation) and the background contributions (Table V) are plotted for DM Model I and DM Model II as be
the case. The observational results of Fermi-LAT [1, 4] experiment is also shown for comparison. It is seen from Figs. 69 that for both Model I and Model II of dark matter, the sum total of calculated flux (both with Mmin = 10−6 M and
Mmin = 10−9 M ) and background is always lower than the Fermi-LAT results for both the chosen values of M when
the “Macciò et al. model for Cvir ” is used for the calculation of γ-ray flux from DM annihilation (Fig. 6 and Fig. 8)
and hence no γ-ray signal from possible extragalactic DM annihilation can be detected above the background. The
fluxes only due to the dark matter annihilation (no background) computed with each of the two chosen values of Mmin
are also shown in Figs. 6-9 by dashed plots. For all the cases considered in Figs. 6-9 for DM candidates in Model I

and Model II, it is observed that the calculated flux with Mmin = 10−9 M always lie above than when computed with
Mmin = 10−6 M . From Fig. 7 and Fig. 9, it is seen that the computed γ-ray flux (added with the background from
non-DM sources) with “Power law model for Cvir ” and Mmin = 10−9 M (solid black line) goes beyond the Fermi-LAT
data upto around Eγ = 10 GeV for Model I (Fig. 7). Even only the computed flux (without the background) with
Mmin = 10−9 M goes beyond the Fermi-LAT data within certain γ-energy range (Fig. 7).
Similar trends are also seen for the case of KK dark matter also (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9). From Fig. 8, one sees that
when “Macciò et al. model for Cvir ” is considered the total computed flux (including non-DM background) always lies
below the observed flux by Fermi-LAT in the considered range for Eγ . But here also the flux with Mmin = 10−9 M
are closer to the observed results than when computed with Mmin = 10−6 M . Interesting results are obtained for
KK dark matter when “Power law model for Cvir ” is used in the calculations (Fig. 9). In Fig. 9 one observes that the

total calculated flux (including the background) with Mmin = 10−6 M agrees very well with the Fermi-LAT results
for almost the whole considered range of Eγ upto the energy ∼ 1 GeV. The total flux, when Mmin = 10−9 M , agrees
with Fermi-LAT in lower energy region (upto ∼ 1 GeV). Comparing with Fig. 7 (similar case for Model I) it appears
that the extragalactic γ-rays from the annihilation of KK dark matter in extra dimensional model better agrees with
experimental results than the WIMP DM of Model I with dark matter mass of 50 GeV. It can also be observed from
Figs. 6-9 that “Power law model for Cvir ”, the concentration parameter, is more suited than the “Macciò et al. model
for Cvir ” in the present calculations.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In this work, we explore the observational upper limits of γ-ray flux from 45 dwarf spheroidal galaxies and relate
these to the γ-rays that could be produced from annihilation of dark matter in dSphs. From the mass to luminosity
ratios, it appears that dSphs could be rich in dark matter and the dark matter can produce γ-rays via the annihilation

process. For our analysis, we consider two dark matter candidates in two particle dark matter models. One is a two
component WIMP-FImP model of which the WIMP component undergoes annihilation to produce the γ-ray flux. The
WIMP component is a Dirac singlet fermion and its additional U(1)DM charge prevents its interaction with Standard
Model (SM) fermions. But the interaction between the WIMP fermion and the SM sector can be occurred via the
higgs portal. The benchmark mass for this dark matter is chosen to be 50 GeV for the present analysis. The other
particle dark matter chosen for the analysis is Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter inspired by models of extra dimensions.
In Universal extra dimensional model B 1 , which we have consider as the KK dark matter candidate in this work,
is the KK partner of hypercharge guage boson. This is stable due to the conservation of KK parity (−1)KK where
KK is the KK number of the Kaluza-Klein tower related to the extra dimensional momentum. The mass of B 1 that
satisfies the dark matter relic density is ∼ 900 GeV. In this work, we have taken the mass of B 1 to be 900 GeV which
is much higher than the Higgs portal fermionic dark matter in Model I. It appears from the analysis that for both the
Higgs portal model and KK model, the dark matter annihilations to γ-rays for 45 dwarf galaxies are well within the
observational upper bounds of the γ-ray flux for all the 45 galaxies considered. While the Higgs portal dark matter
(Model I) covers a shorter range, the Kaluza-Klein dark matter having higher mass range can probe the γ-ray flux at
higher energy range.
We have also extended our analyses for the case of possible extragalactic signature of γ-rays from dark matter
annihilations. If detected, such signals could be the indirect extragalactic dark matter signals. For this extragalactic
case also, we adopt the same dark matter models and the model parameter values given in Tables I and III and
discussed in Sections I and II. But there can be many extragalactic γ-ray sources other than possible dark matter
annihilations. These non-DM sources for extragalactic γ-rays originate the background for the γ-rays produced via
possible extragalactic dark matter annihilations. We have made an estimation of the flux for such extragalactic
sources. The γ-ray flux from dark matter annihilations primarily depends on the annihilation cross-section of the
particle dark matter candidate. In addition to this, the parameters which we need to taken into account for the
γ-ray flux calculation are the dark matter halo mass function, the density fluctuation in the halo, the linear and
non-linear growth of density perturbation and their collapse, the virial radius, the minimum mass Mmin required for
the formation of the subhalo within a DM halo, the γ-ray spectrum ( dN
dE ), the attenuation factor of these γ-rays during
it’s passage towards a terrestrial detector etc. It is also required to use a feasible model for dark matter halo density
profile. In this calculations, NFW density profile has been considered and this NFW density profile is a function of
concentration parameter (cvir ), which plays a major role to compute the extragalactic γ-ray flux originated from the
dark matter annihilation. For the analysis, we adopt two forms for cvir , where one is a power form and the other one
is a form given by [36]. We have considered two distinct values foe minimum mass Mmin , which are Mmin = 10−6 M
and Mmin = 10−9 M . The calculations are performed for the case of the fermionic WIMP dark matter in Model I
and the Kaluza Klein extra dimensional dark matter candidate in Model II. The computed results are then compared
with the observed results for Fermi-LAT satellite borne experiments. Our analyses show that the power law choice
for cvir yields better results in comparison to the other choice. For the case of power law choice for cvir , the γ-ray flux
from the annihilation of fermionic WIMP dark matter of mass 50 GeV in Model I compares well with Fermi-LAT
data at least upto Eγ ∼ 10 GeV when Mmin = 10−6 M and lies above the Fermi-LAT (upto Eγ ∼ 10 GeV) when
Mmin = 10−9 M . Better agreements are obtained for the Kaluza Klein dark matter candidate of Universal Extra
Dimension model (Model II in this work). The KK dark matter candidate is more massive (∼900 GeV) than the

18
WIMP dark matter candidate in Model I (∼50 GeV). The computed flux for this KK DM candidate (for power law
choice of cvir ) agrees satisfactorily with the Fermi-LAT results for Mmin = 10−6 M having a wider energy range than
in case of the former DM candidate.
The present analyses therefore demonstrate the possibilities of detecting indirect signal of dark matter from extragalactic origins as well as from dwarf spheroidals. The results also indicate that the particle nature of dark matter
can be probed from the study of the γ-rays from both dwarf galaxies and extragalactic sources.
