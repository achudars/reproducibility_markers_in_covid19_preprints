UNFOLDING OF ORBIFOLD LG B-MODELS: A CASE STUDY
WEIQIANG HE, SI LI, YIFAN LI

A BSTRACT. In this note we explore the variation of Hodge structures associated to the
orbifold Landau-Ginzburg B-model whose superpotential has two variables. We extend
the Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection to Hochschild chains twisted by group action. As an
application, we provide explicit computations for the Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection
on the universal (noncommutative) unfolding of Z2 -orbifolding of A-type singularities.
The result verifies an example of deformed version of Mckay correspondence.

Introduction
Associated to a triple ( A, W, G ), where A is an associative algebra over C with a

compatible G-action and W is a G-invariant central element of A, we consider a curved
algebra AW [ G ] := A ⋊ C[ G ] with W as a curvature. In this note, we investigate the
deformation theory and Hodge structures for a certain type of such curved algebras.
In [11], we have shown that the compact type Hochschild cohomology
HH•c ( AW , AW [ G ]) G is isomorphic to HH•c ( AW [ G ], AW [ G ]) as Gerstenhaber algebras. As
a consequence, the deformation of AW [ G ] is controlled by the differential graded Lie algebra (dgLa) of the Hochschild cochains (Cc• ( AW , AW [ G ]) G , δb , { , }. In this paper, we
study polynomial algebras in two variables A = C[ x, y]. This includes orbifold ADE singularities as our main interest in this paper. Obstruction theoretical computation shows
that the relevant dgLa is un-obstructed, leading to a smooth formal moduli space M
which is locally parameterized by the Hochschild cohomology HH • ( AW [ G ], AW [ G ]).
Our study of this moduli space M is motivated by Saito’s work [21] on isolated singularities, which is related to so-called Landau-Ginzburg (LG) B-models in modern terminology. In [21], it was shown that the deformation space of an isolated singularity
carries a version of variation of polarized Hodge structures with semi-infinite filtrations. It leads to an integrable structure on the tangent bundle of the moduli, which is
nowadays called Frobenius manifold. This Frobenius manifold structure plays a central role in topological field theories, especially in Gromov-Witten type theories. For
example, the data of Frobenius manifold on the deformation of isolated polynomial singularities is mirror to the data of counting solutions of Witten’s equation on Riemann

1 INTRODUCTION
surfaces, a theory known as Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten (FJRW) theory [7] for LandauGinzburg A-models. However, Saito’s construction only involves ‘un-orbifold’ cases
( A, W, G = h1i), while the full mirror symmetry between Landau-Ginzburg models
asks for all orbifold groups. This requires the construction and computation of Frobenius manifold structure on the aforementioned moduli space M.
Barannikov [1, 2] and Barannikov-Kontsevich [4] introduced the important notion
of (polarized) variation of semi-infinite Hodge structures (VSHS), generalizing Saito’s
framework to many other geometric contexts and non-commutative world [1, 14]. Following this route, we shall consider the period cyclic homology of a deformed algebra
of AW [ G ], with a Hodge filtration induced by the cyclic parameter u and the flat GaussManin connection constructed by Getzler [10]. They give rise to a flat bundle over the
moduli space M, carrying important data of Hodge filtration. In this note, we establish
a version of the Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection via operations of G-twisted cochains
Cc• ( A, A[ G ]) G acting on the G-twisted chains C•c ( A, A[ G ]) G. This encodes the same information as the Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection on the deformation space of the algebra A[ G ], but is easier to compute in practice. As an application, we perform a case
study for orbifold A-type singularity ( A2n−1 , Z2 ). We find (see Theorem 4.1),

Theorem. Consider an orbifold LG B-model ( A, W, G ) with A = C[ x, y], W invertible and
finite G ⊂ SL(2, C) acting diagonally on C2 . The moduli space M of miniversal deformations
of AW [ G ] is smooth, equipped with a variation of semi-infinite Hodge structures (VSHS) given
by a flat vector bundle of period cyclic homologies. In this fashion, there is an isomorphism
between the moduli spaces associated to (C[ x, y], x 2n + y2 , Z2 ) and (C[ z, w], zn + zw2 , h1i),
which is compatible with the VSHS’s on them.

It can be seen as an example of Mckay correspondence for LG models [20], but involves the deformation data. Here, (C[ x, y], x 2n + y2 , Z2 ) is associated to the A2n−1 singularity W = x2n + y2 on an orbifold X = C2 /Z2 and (C[ z, w], zn + zw2 , h1i) is
i

associated to the Dn+1-singularity W̃ = zn + zw2 on C2 ֒→ Y, where π : Y → X is the
minimal resolution (so it is crepant) and W̃ = i ∗ ◦ π ∗ (W ).
There are three directions of generalizations of such a correspondence. One is for
more general triples ( A = O( X ), W, G ) as long as the crepant resolution of X / G exists
and the lifting superpotential W has good Hodge theoretical properties (see [17] for a
recent discussion on this model and references therein). The second is to establish the
correspondence between VSHS’s via crepant resolutions and related mirror symmetry.
This involves a combination of LG/CY correspondence and mirror symmetry. Thirdly,
there is a categorical approach to the orbifold LG models, which is called the equivariant

matrix factorization (see, for example, [6, 19, 23]). It would be very interesting to compare the categorical deformation theory with our calculations. We hope to investigate
these problems in future works.

Preliminary

In this note, C is taken as the base field for convenience. For a Z or Z2 -graded vector
space A, we denote by sA its suspension, where (sA)k := ( A[−1])k = Ak−1 . We use the
Koszul sign convention and regard s as a degree 1 element. Given two graded vector
spaces A and M, the spaces of Hochschild (co)chains and compact type Hochschild
(co)chains are defined as

∏ Hom((sA)⊗ p , sM)[1],

C • ( A, M) :=

Cc• ( A, M) :=

p >0

C• ( A, M) :=

M

Hom ((sA)⊗ p , sM)[1],

p >0

sM ⊗ (sA)

⊗p

[1],

C•c ( A,

∏ sM ⊗ (sA)⊗ p [1].

M) :=

p >0

p >0

We will write [ a1 | · · · | a p ] for an element in (sA)⊗ p , m[ a1 | · · · | a p ] an element in M ⊗

(sA)⊗ p and φ[ a1 | · · · | a p ] the value of φ ∈ C p ( A, M) acting on [ a1 | · · · | a p ].
Remark. For each φ ∈ C p ( A, M), we can associate φ ◦ s⊗ p ∈ Hom ( A⊗ p , M) as
p−1

∑ ( p − k )| a k|

φ ◦ s⊗ p ( a1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ a p ) := (−1) k=1

φ[ a 1 | · · · | a p ] .

This fixes our sign conventions for Hochschild (co)chains.
There are two different gradings for these (co)chains, the tensor grading and the internal grading, which are determined by the grading of A and M. We denote by |·|
the internal grading. For example, for a homogeneous (with respect to both gradings)
cochain φ ∈ C p ( A, M),

(2.1)

|φ| = φ[ a1 | · · · | a p ] − | a1 | − · · · − a p − p.

In [25], Gerstenhaber introduced the brace structure by higher operations, the braces
on (compact type) Hochschild cochians. For homogeneous φ ∈ C p ( A, B) and φk ∈

Notice that there is a one-shifted Lie algebraic structure on (compact type) Hochschild
cochains C • ( A, A) (or Cc• ( A, A)). It is defined [8] as the commutator of Gerstenhaber
product (the brace operation with only one input),

{φ1 , φ2 } := φ1 {φ2 } − (−1)(|φ1 |+1)(|φ2 |+1)φ2 {φ1 }.

(2.3)

In this note, we will work with 2-dimensional orbifold Landau-Ginzburg models
( AW , G ). Here AW is denoted for a curved algebra ( A, W ), where A = C[ x, y] and W is
an invertible polynomial. G with the identity e is a finite group acting diagonally on C2 ,
which can be extended to an equivariant action on A. W is asked to be G-invariant. (See
[15, 7, 11] for details.) We will regard AW as a Z/2Z-graded A∞ -algebra concentrated
in degree zero with b0 = −W, b2 [ a1 | a2 ] = (−1)| a1 | a1 a2 = a1 a2 and bi = 0, ∀i 6= 0, 2.
Similarly, the G-twisted curved algebra AW [ G ] is also regarded as a curved algebra on
A ⊗C C[ G ] with b0 = −We and b2 [ a1 g1 | a2 g2 ] = a1 g1 a2 g1 g2 (Thus, AW [ G ] = A[ G ]W e ).
For an A∞ -algebra A, we can define boundary operators on the (compact type)
Hochschild (co)chains as follows. For a0 [ a1 | · · · | a p ] ∈ C p ( A, A) (or C cp ( A, A)),
∂b ( a0 [ a1 | · · · | a p ]) :=

The (compact type) Hochschild homology and cohomology are defined as the homology and cohomology of the (compact type) chains and cochains with differentials δb and
∂b respectively.
While A is augmented, we may consider the reduced Hochschild (co)chains defined
on Ā = A/C (see [16] for details).

Deformation Theory

As we have shown in [11], we can define higher operations on the G-twisted version
of (compact type) Hochschild cochains. Thus, there is a Gerstenhaber algebra structure
on HH•c ( AW , AW [ G ]) G , which is isomorphic to HH•c ( AW [ G ], AW [ G ]).
Theorem 3.1. Consider orbifold LG B-models ( A, W, G ) with A = C[ x, y], W invertible and
finite G ⊂ SL(2, C) (the Calabi-Yau condition) acting diagonally on C2 . Then the shifted dgLa
(differential graded Lie algebra)

(Cc• ( A, A[ G ]) G , δb , { , })
is homological abelian.
Proof. Use the cochain version of the explicit homotopy retraction constructed in appendix A,

Jac(Wg ) G [−l g ], 0 ,
Cc• ( Ā, Ag) G , δb
where Wg := W |Fix( g) and

lg =

(

0, g = e,
2, g 6= e.

By homotopy transfer theorem, we can define a shifted L∞ -structure on the later, such
that there exists a quasi-isomorphism between shifted L∞ -algebras,


Cc• ( Ā, A[ G ]) G , δb , { , } ≃ Jac(W, G ), 0, ℓ2 + ℓ3 + · · · ,
5

3 DEFORMATION THEORY
where
Jac(W, G ) :=

M

Jac(Wg ) G [−l g ].

g∈ G

Notice that the degrees of ℓk are all odd, while Jac(W, G ) is concentrated in even degrees.

Hence, all of those ℓk ’s are zero and Cc• ( A, A[ G ]) G , δb , { , } is homological abelian. 
We can solve the Maurer-Cartan equation

1
δb (φ) + {φ, φ} = 0,
2
by the quasi-isomorphism defined above with homotopy transfer. With respect to
the tensor grading, the homotopies on Hochschild and Koszul cochains are all of
degree −1 , and the homotopy on polyvector fields shall not give terms of degree
greater than 2. Therefore, Maurer-Cartan elements are in the form of φ = φ0 + φ2 ∈
Cceven ( AW , AW [ G ]) G , where φ0 gives a deformation of b0 and φ2 gives a deformation of
b2 . The miniversal deformation space of AW [ G ] is denoted by Def( AW , G ).
(3.1)

Corollary 3.2. Under the same assumption as Theorem 3.1, a basis of HH•c ( AW , AW [ G ]) G
will give a parametrization of a formal neighbourhood of the origin in Def( AW , G ).
Notice that there is a decomposition,
G
M
HH•c ( AW , AW g) ⊕ HH•c ( AW , AW e) G .
HH•c ( AW , AW [ G ]) G =
g 6 =e

We call the first summand the twisted sector and the second the untwisted sector.
We can identify the formal neighbourhood of the origin in Def( AW , G ) with
Spec(C[[τ , s]]), where variables τ parameterize deformations in the untwisted sector
and s parameterize deformations in the twisted sectors. Let A(τ , s) denote the corresponding deformed curved algebra, with b(τ , s) the deformed A∞ –products. Miniversality says that the following Kodaira-Spencer map is an isomorphism

,
KS : SpanC
→ HH•c ( AW , AW [ G ]) G ,
∂τ ∂s


v
7→ v(b(τ , s))|τ =s=0 .

Also notice that the first order deformation along the untwisted sector deforms the

superpotential, while that along the twisted sector deform the product of the semi-direct
product polynomial ring C[ x, y][ G ].
Remark. In [18], Nadaud introduced three different forms of “q-Moyal products” as
q-deformations of C[ x, y]. By choosing different homotopy retractions between the
Hochschild cochains and Koszul cochains, one can recover these q-Moyal products and
his rigidity indicates that our deformation is in fact somewhat canonical. One should
6

UNFOLDING OF ORBIFOLD LG B-MODELS: A CASE STUDY
also notice that our deformation is equivalent to that constructed by Halbout, Oudom
and Tang in [13]. Especially, their modified superpotential is the same as our deformed
b0 via homotopy transfer.

E. Getzler [10] introduced higher operations b and B on C • ( A, A) with values in
End(C• ( Ā, A)) for any A∞ -algebra A, as extensions of Hochschild differential ∂b and
Connes operator B. Here Ā = C[ x, y]/C. For homogeneous φ1 , · · · , φn ∈ C • ( A, A) and

For n = 0, b{} := ∂b and B{} := B. Using b and B, he defined the Getzler-Gauss-Manin
system for formal deformations of an A∞ -algebra.
We will first extend his constructions to the case of G-twisted chains C•c ( Ā, A[ G ]) G ,
which is much smaller than the space of reduced chains C•c ( A[ G ], A[ G ]). This will
greatly simplify the calculation of the connection in practice.
Consider chain maps Ψ∗ and Γ∗ between C•c ( A, A[ G ]) G and C•c ( A[ G ], A[ G ]) defined as follows. For a0 g0 [ a1 g1 | · · · | a p g p ] ∈ C p ( A[ G ], A[ G ]) and a0 g0 [ a1 | · · · | a p ] ∈

Here, π : C• ( A, A[ G ]) → C• ( A, A[ G ]) G is the natural projection. One can easily check
that Γ∗ is well-defined.
A Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection is a connection defined in terms of the mixed
complex (C• , ∂, B) of a deformed A∞ -algebra, for example, on

C•c (A(τ , s), A(τ , s)), ∂b(τ ,s), B = C•c ( A[ G ], A[ G ])[[τ , s]], ∂b(τ ,s), B .

On twisted chains, we can also define such a mixed complex by defining
(3.7)

∂˜ b(τ ,s) := Ψ∗ ◦ ∂b(τ ,s) ◦ Γ∗ ,

(3.8)

B̃ := Ψ∗ ◦ B ◦ Γ∗ .

b(τ , s) =

Lemma 3.3. ∂˜ b(τ ,s) and B̃ defined above can be extended to higher operations b̃(τ , s) and B̃ on
Cc• ( A, A[ G ]) G [[τ , s]] with values in End(C•c ( Ā, A[ G ]) G [[τ , s]], such that these higher operations are also compatible with Ψ∗ .
Proof. Similar as above, for homogeneous φ1 , · · · , φn ∈ C • ( A, A[ G ]) G, we define

b̃(τ , s){φ1 , · · · , φn } :=Ψ∗ ◦ b(τ , s){Ψ∗ (φ1 ), · · · , Ψ∗ (φn )} ◦ Γ∗ ,

(3.13)

B̃{φ1 , · · · , φn } :=Ψ∗ ◦ B{Ψ∗ (φ1 ), · · · , Ψ∗ (φn )} ◦ Γ∗ .

Here, b(τ , s) and B are the higher operations on Cc• ( A[ G ], A[ G ])[[τ , s]] with values in
End(C•c ( A[ G ], A[ G ])[[τ , s]] extending ∂b(τ ,s) and B and Ψ∗ is the cochain maps we constructed in [11] such that

Ψ∗ (φ)[ a1 g1 | · · · | a p g p ] = φ[ a1 | g1 a2 | · · · | g1 ···g p1 a p ] g1 · · · g p .

One can also directly check that
b̃(τ , s){φ1 , · · · , φn } ◦ Ψ∗ =Ψ∗ ◦ b(τ , s){Ψ∗ (φ1 ), · · · , Ψ∗ (φn )},
B̃{φ1 , · · · , φn } ◦ Φ∗ =Ψ∗ ◦ B{Ψ∗ (φ1 ), · · · , Ψ∗ (φn )}.

By Getzler’s computation [10], there is a connection flat up to homotopy defined as

which induces a flat connection on

HPc• (A(τ , s)) := H• C•c ( A[ G ], A[ G ])[[τ , s]]((u)), ∂b(τ ,s) + uB .

∇ is flat up to homotopy on chain level, which means that ∇ is flat on homologies.
Thus, there is a flat connection

We can give a similar definition for ∇ on G-twisted chains just by replacing b and B
with b̃ and B̃. This will also induce a flat connection on

H• C•c ( Ā, A[ G ]) G [[τ , s]]((u)), ∂˜ b(τ ,s) + u B̃ ,

by the same reason. Lemma 3.3 and the fact that Ψ∗ is a quasi-isomorphism [11] explain why these two constructions define the same flat connection on the periodic cyclic
homology compatible with the Hodge filtration.

An Example: ( A2n−1 , Z2 ) Cases

In this section, we will write down the Getzler-Gauss-Manin system on the miniversal deformation of A2n−1 type orbifold explicitly. Here W = x2n + y2 (n > 2), the
orbifold group is G = Z2 , whose generator σ acts on x, y by σ x = − x, σ y = − y. The
result turns out to coincide with the Gauss-Manin system on the miniversal deformation of Dn+1 singularity. This establishes an example of crepant resolution conjecture
for LG B-models over miniversal deformations. In fact, if we lift the superpotential W
to the crepant resolution of C2 /Z2 , which is the total space of O P 1 (−2), it will have an
isolated singularity of Dn+1 type on the exceptional P 1 .
Computation of A-type orbifolds: W = x2n + y2 , G = Z2
Since Jac(W, G ) = Jac(W ) G e ⊕ Cσ [−2], the formal neighbourhood of the origin in
Def( AW , G ) can be parameterized as Spec(C[[τ0 , τ1 , · · · , τn−1 , s]]) and the deformed
curved algebra A(τ , s) is C[[τ , s]][ x, y] ⊗ C[ G ] with b(τ , s) given by

For G trivial, D. Shklyarov had shown in [22] that the Gauss-Manin system via similar

Theorem 4.1. Viewed as bundles over Spec(C[[τ , s]]), the periodic cyclic homology

(C[ x, y], x2n + y2 , Z2 ) and that of the deformed curved algebra B(τ , s) associated to the LG

this isomorphism is compatible with the Getzler-Gauss-Manin connections on both bundles. To

Appendix

Constructions of the Homotopies

Since we are working on the G-twisted chains, a direct calculation on the ’G-twisted
version’ of periodic homology of those deformed algebras is needed. This can be done
by constructing an explicit special homotopy retraction.
Firstly, consider the Koszul chains,
K• ( A, A[ G ]) :=

M

p >0

14

A [ G ] ⊗ C[ e 1 , e 2 ] ,

with G-action given by

g. ahei1 · · · ei p = g aghg−1g ei1 · · · g ei p .

(A.1)

Here ei are the odd parameters with respect to xi . On Koszul chains, we can define a
differential call a Koszul differential as
p

∂K ( age I ) :=

(A.2)

∑ (−1)k−1 (g xik − xik )age I \{ik} ,

k=1

where I = {i1 < · · · < i p } ⊆ {1, 2}. In [24], Shepler and Witherspoon introduced two
chain maps Φ and Υ and in [11], we construct a homotopy HC such that Φ, Υ are both
G-equivariant and we have a special homotopy retraction

Equivalently, (Φ, Υ, HC ) satisfies that
(
Υ ◦ Φ = id, id − Φ ◦ Υ = [∂˜ b2 , HC ];

HC ◦ HC = 0, HC ◦ Φ = 0, Υ ◦ HC = 0.

Secondly, we can also construct a special homotopy retraction

and HK are all G-equivariant and they give a special homotopy retraction. The former
is obvious and the later is by

CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE HOMOTOPIES

(1) Π ◦ Θ = id,
(2) id − Θ ◦ Π = [HK , ∂K ], because for κ = age I with wt(κ ) 6= 0, we have

[HK , ∂K ](κ ) =

and for κ with wt(κ ) = 0 ⇐⇒ κ = Θ ◦ Π(κ ), we have [HK , ∂K ](κ ) = 0.
(3) HK ◦ HK = 0, HK ◦ Θ = 0 and Π ◦ HK = 0 for obvious reasons.
As a direct corollary, we have the following homotopy retraction,

Ω• (Fix( g)) G , 0 .

By taking the compact type, we can regard ∂˜ b0 as a small perturbation of ∂˜ b2 to get a
perturbed special homotopy retraction. (See for example [5].)
Lemma A.1. The induced differential on Ω• (Fix( g)) G by the perturbation with respect to ∂˜ b0
is given by dWg ∧.

Proof. By definition, the induced differential is given by
ΠΥ ◦ ∂˜ b0 ◦ ΦΘ +

∑ (−1)i ΠΥ ◦ ∂˜ b0

i >1

(HC + ΦHK Υ)∂˜ b0

Notice that

i

◦ ΦΘ.

(A.5)
ΠΥ ◦ ∂˜ b0 ◦ ΦΘ|Ω• ( Fix( g))G = dWg ∧, and ΠΥ ◦ ∂˜ b0 = (dWg ∧) ◦ ΠΥ on Ω• (Fix( g)) G ,
so the higher order terms in the differential on the g-sector Ω• (Fix( g)) G can be written
as

∑ (−1)i ΠΥ ◦ ∂˜ b0

i >1

(HC + ΦHK Υ)∂˜ b0

i

◦ ΦΘ

= ∑ (−1)i (dWg ∧) ◦ ΠΥ (HC + ΦHK Υ)∂˜ b0

=0.

i

The last equality is because ΥHc = 0 and ΠΥΦHK = ΠHK = 0.

In summary, we have the following homotopy retraction,

for g 6= e in 2-dimensional Calabi-Yau cases. Then (A.6) gives a special homotopy
retraction.
Remark. There are many choices for (i, p, HΩ ) and none is canonical. For example, for
W = xn + ym with G trivial on C2 , we can select such an HΩ as


0,
a < n − 1,
HΩ ( x a yb dy) :=0,

(A.10)

with the easiest inclusion i and projection p.
Finally, we can regard the deformed differential ∂˜ b(τ ,s) + u B̃ as a perturbation of ∂˜ b .
Then if G satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition that G ⊂ SL(2, C), we have a special homotopy retraction,
(A.11)
C•c ( Ā, A[ G ]) G [[τ , s]]((u)), ∂˜ b(τ ,s) + u B̃



L

g∈ G


Jac(Wg ) G [2 − Ig ][[τ , s]]((u)), 0 .

The induced differential on the right complex is zero because it is concentrated in
even degrees.
Remark. We only construct the homotopies in two dimensional cases. However, they all
can generalized in any dimensions.
