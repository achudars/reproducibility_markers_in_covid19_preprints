A compact stellar-mass object inspiralling onto a massive black hole deviates from geodesic motion due to
radiation-reaction forces as well as finite-size effects. Such post-geodesic deviations need to be included with
sufficient precision into wave-form models for the upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detector LISA. I
present the formulation and solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of geodesics near Kerr black holes perturbed by the so-called spin-curvature coupling, the leading order finite-size effect. In return, this solution allows to compute a number of observables such as the turning points of the orbits as well as the fundamental
frequencies of motion. This result provides one of the necessary ingredients for waveform models for LISA and
an important contribution useful for the relativistic two-body problem in general.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of an astrophysical object with a background
gravitational field is characterized by its physical size and gravitational radius. If both of these are much smaller than the curvature radius (variability length) of the background, the center of mass of the body will follow an almost geodesic trajectory in the surrounding space-time [1–3]. The post-geodesic
corrections to the motion will then scale with powers of the
ratio of either the physical size or gravitational radius of the
body with respect to the curvature radius. Technically, the
whole object is understood in this approximation as a “particle” carrying mass multipole moments, and the corrections
are expressed as radiation-reaction forces as well as interactions of the multipoles of the body with the background field.
This post-geodesic approach is also often called the “self-force
program”, referring to the fact that the additional forces appear due to the object-specific interaction with the background
rather than only due to the background field itself.
The mentioned post-geodesic expansion is well suited to describe gravitational-wave inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes, which are one of the key sources
of gravitational radiation for the upcoming space-based detector LISA [4, 5]. For these so-called extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), both of the aforementioned expansion parameters become proportional to the ratio q ≡ µ/M ∼ 10−4 −
10−11 , where M, µ are the masses of the primary and secondary of the binary respectively.
EMRI phasing. Assuming that a geodesic in the field of the
primary is fully determined by some set of constants of motion
(orbital parameters) and phase variables, we can sort the postgeodesic deviations into two classes based on their long-term
effects [6]. First, the gravitational radiation will carry away
a part of the constants of motion such as energy and angular
momentum, and will thus lead to a long-term change in their
values. These effects are conventionally called dissipative.
Second, the deviations will cause the constants of motion to
oscillate as well as to change the rates at which the trajectory
goes through its phases. In the long term, this can be characterized as a change of the frequency with which we see the
orbit is passing through its phases or, alternatively, as a secu-

Hamilton-Jacobi equation for spinning particles near black holes
science were investigated in Refs. [36–39]. For the case of
the spin perturbation the spin force could cause resonances of
√
width O( q) and one can also have spin-orbital resonances
corresponding to an integer ratio of frequency of the evolution
of the spin and some of the orbital frequencies.
Hidden symmetry. The Kerr black hole has a “hidden symmetry” (see section 2.1) and it was often investigated whether
this implies new conserved quantities along the motion of spinning particles. Rüdiger [40, 41] found approximate integrals of
motion for spinning particles under the Tulczyjew-Dixon supplementary spin condition in general space-times with hidden
symmetry (see section 4.3), and Apostolatos [42] and Kunst
et al. [43] found such integrals of motion in Schwarzschild
space-time under the Mathisson-Pirani and Newton-Wigner
conditions respectively. Conserved quantities due to the hidden symmetry for the motion of semi-classical spinning particles (particles with supersymmetry on the wordline) were then
studied in Refs. [44–47]. Additionally, it was observed in
the frequency-domain analysis by Ruangsri et al. [48] that the
hidden symmetry seems to “protect” the spin-perturbed orbits
from resonances and chaos.
The purpose of this paper is to present a complete scheme
for the computation of the conservative spin-curvature corrections to geodesic motion. The core of the computational
scheme is an analytical perturbative solution of the HamiltonJacobi equation for the particle with spin orbiting a Kerr black
hole on a generally inclined and eccentric trajectory.
The solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is almost, but
not quite separable in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and it leads
to two separation constants equivalent to those of Rüdiger
[40, 41]. Consequently, the order (or number) of the equations of motion is reduced to half while not yielding them fully
separable. Nevertheless, this still allows to analytically solve
for the turning points, and to obtain actions and shifts of the
fundamental frequencies of motion in terms of simple quadratures. These results resolve the question of the conservative
spin-induced post-geodesic phase shifts in EMRIs (appearing
at O(q) in the equations of motion) and provide interesting
prospects for the computation of the dissipative effects (appearing at O(q 2 ) in the equations of motion).
The paper is organized as follows. I start with stating all
the important relations and definitions for time-like geodesics
in Kerr space-time in Section 2, and I introduce the Hamiltonian formalism for spinning particles along with the set of
coordinates and the adapted tetrad I use in Section 3. Then
I present the perturbative solution to the respective HamiltonJacobi equation along with a discussion of separation constants
in Section 4. Finally, the computation of various properties of
the spin-perturbed orbits such as turning points or frequencies
of motion are discussed in Section 5. Details of the derivations
of Section 5 are discussed in the Appendix.
I use the G = c = 1 geometrized units and the (-+++)
signature of the metric. The ordinary derivative with respect
to xµ is denoted by an index µ preceded by a comma, and a
covariant derivative with an index preceded by a semi-colon.
My convention for the Riemann tensor Rµναβ is such that
aµ;αβ − aµ;βα = Rνµαβ aν for a generic aµ . η µν with any indices is the Minkowski tensor, and δ µ ν denotes the Kronecker

lar accumulation of a set of post-geodesic phase-shifts. This
second type of effects is usually called conservative.1
It is now generally accepted that wave-form models that
will allow LISA to accurately estimate the parameters of the
sources have to include all dissipative post-geodesic corrections to the equations of motion up to O(q 2 ) and conservative
corrections up to O(q) [1, 3, 6]. The only O(q) correction to
the equations of motion due to the finite size of the body is the
so-called spin-curvature coupling and it is entirely conservative.
Spin-curvature coupling. The spin-curvature coupling
arises due to the fact that different parts of a relativistically rotating body interact with the background space-time in a way
that ends up exerting a “spin force” on the center of mass that
is proportional to the angular momentum of the body about its
center and the background curvature. The dissipative O(q 2 )
effects due to the finite size of the body then currently seem to
be only cross-terms of radiation reaction and spin; the gravitational radiation will gradually carry away a part of the internal
angular momentum of the body or irreversibly “steer” its direction, and the fluctuations to the orbit due to the spin force will
slightly modulate the power with which the geodesic constants
of motion are radiated away.
There is a long history of works studying the motion of spinning test bodies in black hole space-times, most of which was
reviewed in Refs. [7, 8]. A subset of these studies then used the
spinning test body motion to generate and study outgoing gravitational waves [9–13]. Yet another thread of research computed the precession of the spin of the particle as a gauge invariant probe of the self-force, which is convenient for comparison with other approaches to the relativistic two-body problem [14–18]. Various perturbative formalisms for the computation of post-geodesic corrections to orbital motion in black
hole space-times due to the spin-curvature coupling were previously formulated [19–22], typically focusing on numerical
solutions of the equations or on special classes of orbits. Finally, concrete computations of EMRIs with spin effects were
carried out in Refs. [23–27].
Resonances. It is routinely observed that perturbationtheory techniques fail in the neighborhood of orbits for which
unperturbed fundamental frequencies reach integer ratios [28].
Generally, the perturbation of order
√ then causes a qualitative
change in the behaviour of an O( ) volume of orbits in the
neighborhood of these so-called resonant orbits. This issue
has also been identified in the case of perturbative expansion
of EMRIs [29], the locations of the orbital resonances were
computed by Brink et al. [30, 31], the physical consequences
of the passage of an EMRI through a resonance were studied in
Refs. [32–35], and consequences of resonant effects for LISA

Note that the “dissipative” effects do not correspond to any transfer of information from the orbit into microscopic degrees of freedom, they correspond
to the transfer of information into macroscopic gravitational-wave degrees
of freedom. On the other hand, the “conservative” effects cannot be completely captured as a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian perturbation to the original
Lagrangian or Hamiltonian, so the dissipative/conservative nomenclature
should be understood exactly as stated in the text.

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation for geodesics in Kerr spacetime is separable in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, which was
shown by Carter [52]. Additionally, if one uses the Mino time

KERR GEODESICS

Geodesics in a given space-time are perhaps the most faithful conveyors of its geometry. Kerr geodesics and their properties will be important in various different ways in the upcoming sections; they will generate the tetrad used in section 3,
and serve as a “zeroth-order” unperturbed or fiducial system
in sections 4 to 5. Hence, I will now briefly summarize the
necessary notation and details about them.

where the factor 1/ sin ϑ in the ϑ equation comes from the fact
that it is often practical to use the variable ζ = cos ϑ in the
integration as well as symbolic manipulation of the equations.
The ϕ, t motion can be integrated once r(λ), ϑ(λ) is known.
Various other formulae and results for the geodesic motion in
Kerr space-time were summarized by Chandrasekhar [54].

Characterization by roots

We saw in the last section that a geodesic in Kerr spacetime is uniquely specified by the set of constants of motion
K, E, L. Nevertheless, it is sometimes useful to instead specify the geodesics by their turning points. The functions R, Θ
can be rewritten as

(1)

R(r) = (1 − E 2 )(r1g − r)(r − r2g )(r − r3g )(r − r4g ) ,

Θ(ϑ) = a2 (1 − E 2 )(z+g − cos2 ϑ)(z−g − cos2 ϑ) ,

where Σ = r + a cos ϑ and ∆ = r − 2M r + a . The Kerr
metric is independent of t, ϕ, which makes specific energy
E ≡ −ut and specific azimuthal angular momentum L ≡ uϕ
constants of geodesic motion, where uµ = dxµ /dτ, uµ uµ =
−1 is the four-velocity.
The Kerr metric possesses a Killing-Yano tensor Yµν =
−Yνµ , Yµν;κ = −Yµκ;ν with the components [50, 51]

where r1g , r2g , r3g , r4g are the roots of the function R(r) ordered by magnitude from largest to smallest, and z±g are the
cos2 ϑ roots of Θ. The geodesic itself will oscillate in the “box”
√

cos ϑ ∈ (− z−g , z−g ) , r ∈ (r2g , r1g ). To obtain an intuitive picture of the orbit, it is useful to parametrize the radial
turning points by eccentricity e and semi-latus rectum p [55]

The set of orbital parameters p, e, z−g specify a geodesic
uniquely, and the relation to the K, E, L specification was
given by Drasco and Hughes [56]. Furthermore, Fujita and
Hikida [57] gave analytical expressions for fundamental frequencies of motion based on this formalism (for similar analytical results in space-times generalizing the Kerr space-time,
see Refs. [58–60]). Many of the aforementioned formulae are
implemented in the KerrGeodesics Mathematica package [61].

Yrt = −Ytr = a cos ϑ ,
Yrϕ = −Yϕr = −a2 cos ϑ sin2 ϑ ,
Yϑϕ = −Yϕϑ = (r2 + a2 )r sin ϑ ,
Yϑt = −Ytϑ = −ar sin ϑ ,
Ytϕ = −Yϕt = Yrϑ = −Yϑr = 0 .

The properties of the Killing-Yano tensor imply parallel transport of a vector lµ = Y µν uν along geodesics, lµ;ν uν = 0.
This also implies the conservation of the square of this vector dK/dτ = 0, K ≡ lµ lµ . It is natural to interpret lµ as
some sort of specific angular momentum vector, and K, also
known as the Carter constant [52], as specific angular momentum squared. The existence of the tensor Yµν in the Kerr metric
is considered to be a “hidden symmetry” of the space-time.

of finite size will, in fact, have an infinite tower of multipoles,
but I neglect the influence of quadrupole and higher order moments since I am concerned here only with the leading-order
finite-size effects on the orbital motion.

The MPD equations require a specification in which frame
V µ the center of mass as well as the multipoles are computed.
Consequently, the electric-type dipole S µν Vν vanishes in this
frame. I choose this frame as parallel to P µ , S µν Pν = 0,
which is known as the Tulczyjew-Dixon or “covariant” supplementary spin condition [65, 66] (see [67] for a review of
other choices of V µ ). A concise summary of the MPD equations under the Tulczyjew-Dixon condition in Kerr space-time
is given in Ref. [7].

Consider a tetrad basis eCµ , C = 0, 1, 2, 3, eCµ eµD = ηCD

I now briefly introduce the Hamiltonian formalism for the
MPD equations, since the knowledge of the Hamiltonian and
canonical coordinates covering the phase space are prerequisites for the formulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in
section 4. An important point is the introduction of a specifically oriented set of coordinates through an adapted tetrad in
section 3.3, the choice of which ultimately allows for the partial separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

The equality ∼

initial data is chosen such that U µ Uµ = −1 and sµν Uν = 0,
and these relations are then also conserved along the motion. An additional quantity that is conserved along the motion
p is the magnitude of the specific angular momentum s =
sµν sµν /2. For more details on the Hamiltonian formalism
for spinning particles see Ref. [68].

The physical ranges of these coordinates are A ∈ [−2(B +

One can notice from the previous section that different
choices of the tetrad eCµ correspond to a different covering
of the phase space of the spinning particle by canonical coordinates. It is well known that choosing the right set of coordinates is often crucial to the analytical solution of a problem.
I now introduce a special “geodesic-adapted” tetrad that will
provide a useful basis for the computations in the next parts of
the paper.
We start with taking a geodesic congruence with constants
of motion Kc , Ec , Lc as the zeroth leg

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is obtained by substituting
canonical momenta in the Hamiltonian by gradients of the action W (t, ϕ, r, ϑ, φ, ψ) with respect to their conjugate coordinates. Specifically, we have Uµ → W,µ , A → W,φ , B →
W,ψ . In the case s = 0 (A = 0, B = 0) the Hamilton-Jacobi

where one should always remember that sCD is given by (10)
and A → W,φ , B → W,ψ .
When we further choose the signature of the background
(0)
tetrad identical to that of W,µ and the tetrad parameters
Kc , Ec , Lc O(s)-close to the constants of motion of W (0) , we
obtain up to higher-order terms

(20)
(21)

It is then easy to verify that the tetrad is orthonormal and normalized, eAµ eµB = ηAB . Note that apart from the parameters
Kc , Ec , Lc the tetrad also needs to be specified by the choices
of the sign of e0r , e0ϑ , and also that it is defined only within
the turning points of the congruence. Finally, when we compare our tetrad with that of Marck [70], we see that they are
identical, even though they have been arrived to by different
procedures.
Thanks to the construction of the tetrad we have eκ3;µ eµ0 = 0
and the only nonzero projection of the zeroth leg into the spin
connection components is eκ1;µ e2κ eµ0 = −eκ2;µ e1κ eµ0 , which
reads

Swing region solution

Let us first assume that we are in the “swing region” of the
tetrad, that is, far away from the turning points of the congruence uµc . Formally the swing region is specified as the range
√
of r, ϑ for which |r − r1,2c |  s and r(|cos ϑ| − z−c )  s,
√
where r1,2c , z−c correspond to the turning points of the
background congruence.
Now we are looking for a swing-region solution to the ac(0)
(1sw)
= W,µ + O(s). The Hamilton-Jacobi equation
tion W,µ
obtained from (7) then reads

(15)

Kµν ≡ Yµκ Yνκ ,

(23)

which is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesic with
the well known solution by Carter [52] (see Section 2).
Now we want to perturb the zeroth-order solution by adding
terms linear in spin to equation (23). However, it turns out that
when we use the adapted tetrad presented in the previous section, the size of the connection terms change as we approach
the turning points of the background congruence. Thus, I construct the solution in two steps that correspond to regions with
different magnitudes of the connection terms.

In other words, e0µ = uµc . Now another leg of the tetrad
can be generated
√ by the antisymmetric Killing-Yano tensor
e3µ = Yµν uνc / Kc . The last two legs are also generated by
the Killing-Yano tensor as

(25)

Now we notice that the only appearing component of spin is
s12 = A + B + s → W,φ + W,ψ + s. The phases φ, ψ are
thus cyclical coordinates and the initial values of A, B integrals of motion. Furthermore, the Tulczyjew-Dixon condition
boils down to sC0 = 0 + O(s2 ) or W,ψ = 0 + O(s2 ) (cf. eq.
(10)). Consequently, the value of the coordinate ψ has no influence on either the spin tensor or the orbital motion at given
order.

(22)

We will see that this separable form of the projections will be
crucial in solving the perturbative Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Turning region corrections

Particular choices of Cy might improve the properties of the
approximation, but I will use here Cy = 0.
Finally, by substituting the action including the turningregion corrections back in the full Hamilton-Jacobi equation
we see that the error terms are O(s2 ) terms in the swing regions, and O(s3/2 ) in the turning regions. Finding necessary
turning-point corrections even for these O(s3/2 ) terms is necessary before terms quadratic in spin can be included. However, I will leave this task for further work.
In summary, the action valid both in the turning and swing
regions up to O(s) terms reads

The swing solution of the perturbative action stays valid
even when we shift Kc , Ec , Lc by an O(s) shift, and we can
assume that we can always choose the congruence constants
so that the motion corresponding to W (1sw) avoids the turning
points (and thus singularities) of the tetrad by an O(s) distance.

The first line in (28) corresponds to the swing-region terms,
but the second line is new and makes W (1sw) an invalid solution for the action already at O(s).
I now use the following Ansatz in order derive turningregion corrections to the action. First, I replace all the instances of sCD with s̃CD ≡ sCD (A → sk − s; B → 0) in the
equations and assume that the solution using this Ansatz will
be valid at least up to O(s). Next, I assume that there exist
corrections of the form δy W (t) such that W (1) = W (1sw) +
√
δr W (t) + δϑ W (t) and δy W (t) ∼ s2 / y − yt . As a result,
these corrections are of higher-order in the swing region and
contribute to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation at O(s) only in
their respective y-turning region. Then the corrections must

interpreted as some sort of “spin-orbital angular momentum
squared”. However, notice that KR is not the square of the
vector lµ + sµ .
Now we can compare with the separation constants such as
sk , Kso . Let us compute

(37)

sk = s̃12 =

Now one can relate the spin-orbital constants of motion
Kso , Eso , Lso to the orbital functions defined above as

In other words, CY = Kc sk + O(s2 , s3/2 ). Notice that it is
exactly this factor that appears in wy0 and we can thus say that
the correction to the action in the swing region is proportional
to lµ sµ . Furthermore, the cases sk = ±s correspond to s̃23 =
s̃31 = 0 and the spin completely aligned or counter-aligned
with the orbital angular momentum respectively.
To compare KR with Kso , one simply needs to substitute
the spin-perturbed four-velocity into (43), and a somewhat involved computation yields

where O(s2 ; s3/2 ) denotes error terms of order O(s2 ) in the
swing regions and O(s3/2 ) in the turning regions. Furthermore, ΓCDκ ≡ Γµνκ eµD eνD are the Christoffel symbols projected into the tetrad (I used the fact that the tetrad is independent of t, ϕ).
Now we see that the left-hand sides of equations (38),
(39) and (40) are constant and the right hand sides contain
Ko , Eo , Lo and fluctuating terms, which makes the orbital energy, angular momentum, and “orbital Carter constant” timevariable. Furthermore, it is easy to see that the spin-orbital
constants of motion are generally not equal even to average values of the orbital functions and that there is a persistent O(s)
shift between the two.
Constants of motion of spinning particles under the
Tulczyjew-Dixon condition were studied by Rüdiger [40, 41].
He found exact integrals of motion in space-times with an explicit symmetry and a corresponding Killing vector ξ µ given
as

is an important consistency check for the solution (33).

ORBITAL MOTION

In many problems in classical mechanics, orbital motion
turns out to be separable and solvable by a finite set of quadratures (closed-form integrals) once the Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been separated. However, we will see that the perturbative construction of the action from the last section does not
allow for such a separation of orbital equations of motion.
Nevertheless, in section 5.2 I will show that it is still possible to analytically determine the corrections to the turning
points of the motion, and, in return, this is used in section 5.4
to determine the corrections to the fundamental frequencies of
motion by a finite set of quadratures.

(41)
5.1.

By comparing these integrals of motion corresponding to the
t and ϕ symmetry of Kerr space-time, we find that they are
exactly equal to the constants −Eso , Lso respectively.
Additionally, Rüdiger found approximately conserved quantities associated with the existence of a Killing-Yano tensor
Yµν , which can be written as

scheme is consistent with the accuracy to which the HamiltonJacobi equation was solved as well as with the goal to acquire
r(λ), ϑ(λ) orbital shape at O(s) precision. We immediately
see that the equations of motion are not separable, since the
connection terms are mixed and since s̃CD involves trigonometric functions of φ.
One interesting feature of the equations of motion is the
change in the symmetries as compared to geodesic motion. For
instance, |dϑ/dλ| is not symmetric with respect to reflections
about the equatorial plane ϑ → π − ϑ; it is only symmetric
with respect to the combined transformation consisting of a
reflection ϑ → π − ϑ coupled with either s̃CD → −s̃CD or
dϑ/dλ → −dϑ/dλ. In other words, when the particle is at a
given distance |ϑ−π/2| from the equatorial plane, it will move
at a slightly different dϑ/dλ when it is moving towards the
equatorial plane than when it is moving away from the equatorial plane.

The condition for the turning points can be written as

(47)

(y)

where the expressions for XκD are evaluated at the respective
y = ygt . Note that I have discarded O(s3/2 ) terms that come
from the fact that the tetrad-congruence constants Kc , Ec , Lc
are generally O(s)-shifted with respect to the fiducial-geodesic
constants K, E, L. In the Appendix I will not discard such
(y)
terms for technical reasons and the term XκC eκD is then simply
replaced by e0y eCκ;y eκD |y=ygt .
To perform a consistency check of the results, I have taken
the effective potentials of spinning particles with aligned spin
in the equatorial plane as given by Tod et al. [71] or Hackmann
et al. [72], and found its turning points to linear order in spin
to obtain the exact same results as in (48).
One should notice that the formulae (48) are finite for motion in the equatorial plane (K = (L − aE)2 ) only thanks
to the choice K = Kso − 2ask sgn(Lso − aEso ). For other
choices of the fiducial mapping, the ϑ turning
√ points of spinperturbed near-equatorial motion will be O( s) far from the
turning points of the fiducial geodesic.
However, the choice of the fiducial geodesics that I give
here does not yet avoid similar singularities in δrt as the motion becomes near-circular. To regularize this case, one must
choose E(Eso , Lso ), L(Eso , Lso ) so that the fiducial geodesic
circularizes at an O(s)-close radius and for the same values of
Eso , Lso as the spin-perturbed orbit itself. Such a construction
is somewhat involved and I leave it for future work.
Let us now shortly discuss the qualitative features of the
spin-perturbed turning points. The first thing to notice is the
fact that the turning points are not separable any more, the connection terms are functions of both r, ϑ, and s̃CD is generally
a function of φ whenever sk 6= ±s. The shape of the “turning
box” in the r, ϑ plane is illustrated in Fig. 1. One last thing
to notice is the fact that in the aligned/counter-aligned case
sk = ±s the spin tensor does not depend on φ and the turning

where again y = r, ϑ. Now it might
√ be tempting to discard the
connection term since e0y ∼ O( s) near the√turning point,
but the eκC;y will counter it by becoming O(1/ s) in the turning region. Thus, the whole connection term stays O(s) and
needs to be included in the computation.
I express the turning points in terms of shifts with respect
to turning points of fiducial geodesics. It is important to note
that these fiducial geodesics will not be the same geodesics
as the ones generating the tetrad congruence. Specifically, I
choose the fiducial geodesic to have constants of motion K =
Kso − 2ask sgn(Lso − aEso ), L = Lso , and E = Eso . Then
I assume that the turning point is O(s)-shifted away from the
turning point of the geodesic, yt = ygt + δyt , δyt ∼ O(s).

(r, ϑ, φ, Ur , Uϑ , A), at least in the case of bound motion that is
of interest here. Whenever such a torus identified in a dynamical system with canonical coordinates pi , q i , it is possible to

This also proves that, to linear order in spin, the spin perturbation will not cause any topological changes in the action foliation of the phase space around resonant orbits (in contrast to
generic perturbed integrable systems). The recent numerical
study of Ref. [73] has examined several resonances caused by
the spin and only found those caused by second order in spin.

where the generalized Stokes theorem implies that this integral is only dependent on the homotopy equivalence class of
the loop (the class of loops that can be deformed into each other
without discontinuing the loop). When, furthermore, the actions are defined over n homotopically inequivalent loops over
an n-torus Tn , they can always be completed into an actionangle system of coordinates [28].

component of spin survives in any geodesic average. In other
words, only the value of sk (and not of s) is important in the
long-term effects of the spin perturbation.
I have computed the relative frequency shifts hδfy /f ig for a
sample of geodesics and plotted them in Fig. 2. There is nothing particularly unexpected about the qualitative behavior of
the shifts; they are a factor of few times the spin and the radial
corrections diverge as the motion becomes radially unstable
near the black hole.
One can also use this formalism to compute the average azimuthal angular frequency Ῡϕ and average rate of coordinate

Hamilton-Jacobi equation for spinning particles near black holes

multipoles of a dynamical black hole the Geroch-Hansen multipoles? Where is the centroid of a spinning black hole moving
in a general background space-time?
Resonances and chaos. The perturbative solution of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equations as presented in this paper does not
rely on the orbits having non-integer ratios between frequencies and, thus, there is no reason to believe the solution is problematic around resonant orbits, as is also indicated in section
5.3.
On the other hand, the action W (1) can be fully valid while
still producing resonant effects on the level of the orbital
shapes generated by the equations of motion (46). For instance, the perturbative computation of the fundamental frequencies in (56) will be ill-defined when the motion is resonant
and δfy /fy has a corresponding non-zero harmonic. Ruangsri
et al. [48] did not observe any resonances under the spin perturbation in their frequency-domain analysis, which they attributed to the existence of the Rüdiger constants (see section
4.3). It seems plausible that the existence of the additional
near-conserved quantities would suppress the resonances, but
I will have to leave the question unanswered for a lack of conclusive arguments.
As for the question of chaos - for weakly perturbed integrable systems it is well known to occur only in a thin layer of
the topological transition between the bulk of the motion and
the resonant layer. The thickness of the chaotic layer caused
by a smooth Hamiltonian perturbation of size ε is even conjectured to scale as ∼ exp(−λ/|ε|) as ε → 0 [28]. Since no
such topological transitions are even present in the foliation of
phase space at given order, we can safely that chaotic motion
caused by linear-in-spin perturbations is negligible.
Generalizations to other space-times. The construction
given in this paper has some obvious mathematical generalizations. It is possible to repeat the separation in an identical manner in the entire class of four-dimensional Kerr-NUT-(A)dS
space-times [80] and for massless spinning particles possibly
even in the entire Plebański-Demiański class of space-times
[81]. Similarly, it seems to be easy to generalize the construction to Kerr-NUT-(A)dS space-times of dimension 5 by using the tetrad found by Connell et al. [82]. However, it has to
be explicitly verified whether the growing number of degrees
of freedom of a classical rotating body in growing dimension
match or outpace the number of integrals of motion provided
by the hidden symmetry (see [47] for a discussion of this issue
for a semi-classical spinning particle).
Implications for self-forced inspirals. The computation of
the shift to fundamental frequencies the way it is presented
here provides almost all the necessary ingredients for the
implementation of the conservative spin-curvature coupling
into EMRI codes based on the two-timescale approximation
scheme [6, 83]. The only issue to resolve is a mapping of the
spin-perturbed orbits to a set of fiducial geodesic that remains
O(s) close to identity even for near-circular and circular orbits.
However, as already discussed in the Introduction, the nonnegligible finite-size effects in EMRIs also include the dissipative decay of spin and a correction to the dissipation rates of
the orbital constants of motion due to the spin perturbation to
the trajectory.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOKS

Hidden symmetry and multipole particles. The separation
of variables of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the swing region is a consequence of the hidden symmetry of the Kerr
space-time and so is the conservation of Kso . However, this
result may be puzzling for the following reason. On one hand,
the pole-dipole MPD equations describe the motion of systems
that are keeping in balance by internal exchange of momentum (e.g. neutron stars), and on the other hand, it was shown
that the conservation of the sum of Carter constants is violated for any system with components that exchange momentum [74, 75].
This apparent discrepancy is easily explained; the poledipole system of equations is universal in the sense that it
represents and evolves any body of the given value of the
mass multipoles in the same way. In other words, an initially compact rotating cloud of non-interacting free test particles can be described in a multipolar expansion, and the equations of motion truncated at the pole-dipole level will be the
same as the ones we use for an astrophysical compact body –
apart from the fact that the cloud will spread and the higherorder multipoles quickly become non-negligible. Since the
free-streaming cloud does conserve the sum of its particles’
Carter constants, an approximate “total Carter constant” such
as KR , Kso must exist for the pole-dipole system of equations.
Nevertheless, the pole-dipole order is the only order where
we can replace an astrophysical body with a cloud of dust
and obtain the same equations of motion; the pole-dipolequadrupole equations are not universal anymore since the
quadrupole dynamics include the composition-specific response of the body [76, 77]. While the cloud of free-streaming
particles should still conserve a total Carter constant in the
multipolar formalism, there is no reason to believe this will
be the case for the astrophysical body described by different
evolution equations. On the contrary, since the quadrupole dynamics of the astrophysical body are governed by momentumexchanging processes in its interior, one should expect no conservation of the sum of Carter constants.
Thus, I believe that the description of general classical bodies to pole-dipole order is precisely the point to which hidden
symmetry is relevant. In other words, I believe it will not be
possible to generalize the construction given in this paper to
higher order multipoles and powers of spin, at least for the motion of objects with sufficiently general tidal response.
On the other hand, one can speculate that special cases of interest might still exhibit a conserved Carter-like constant even
at higher (or even all) multipole orders. Isolated black holes
possess a specific tower of Geroch-Hansen mass multipoles
that are all generated by the black hole spin [78]. However,
a major obstruction in translating this to the MPD equations
is the fact that there is no established dictionary between the
Geroch-Hansen and MPD multipoles on a generally curved
background (on a near-flat background, the case seems reasonably clear [79]). Specifically, if we postulate the multipoles
under one supplementary spin condition and transform to a
different one, the multipoles will transform as well (see, e.g,
Ref. [77]). So the question is: In which frame are the MPD

Hamilton-Jacobi equation for spinning particles near black holes

The two constants of motion in the
√ spin sector are the
aligned component of spin sk = CY / K and the total spin
magnitude s. The evolution of the spin tensor can be viewed
as parallel transport in a certain smooth metric gµν + hR
µν
[2, 84]. Since the magnitude of spin is conserved in any metric, we may deduce the immediate magnitude of spin s2g ≡
sµν sκλ gµκ gνλ /2 from the conserved value of s2h+g = s2g +
sµν sκλ gµκ hR
νλ and the local value of the metric perturbation
hR
.

the orbital parameters due to the spin perturbation of the orbit requires the ability to compute averages hisp of various
functions over the spin-perturbed orbit. However, only averages of functions that are additively separable can be given in
terms of simple geodesic averages such as in equation (60).
In constrast, the mode-sum method of computing the metric
perturbations naturally works with multiplicatively separable
functions. Hence, it seems that one will need to compute a
sufficient number of Fourier coefficients of δfy /fy in order to
construct the shift vector ξ~ (from equation (A21)) and use it
in the hisp averages. However, this will also require a careful treatment of the turning-point singularities that arise in the
formalism.

The expressions Yr , Yϑ expanded to O(s) are now regular and

they will generally have an O(s2 ) term that diverges as 1/ y − yt around
the turning point. I assume that one can always introduce an
O(s) shift to the background congruence constants Kc , Lc , Ec
so as to cancel this term. In practice, I simply expand to linear
order in s as Yy = Yy0 +δYy +O(s2 ) and discard higher-order

the O(s) singular terms in δfy correspond to the regular nonexpanded dχy /dλ receiving a O(1) spin-correction within an

simpler to keep the formulae in expanded form since these singular terms end up averaging out to zero in any expression of
interest (see section 5).

where G, H were defined in (48). Note that I am using the
same fiducial geodesic K = Kso +2ask sgn(Lso −aEso ), E =
Eso , L = Lso as in the computation of the turning-point shifts.
Additionally, one must sew the functions Jy (χr , χϑ ) from
parts where the congruence four-velocity uµc = eµ0 always has
the same signature as the actual four-velocity uµ .
The expressions for δYy avoid 1/ cos(χy )2 singularities by
the numerators of the first terms vanishing at χy = π/2, 3π/2;
this is easily seen by comparing with the turning-point formulae (48a) and (48b). Nevertheless, we must still verify that
the numerator of the first term in δYy has a zero derivative
with respect to χy at χy = π/2, 3π/2, otherwise a 1/ cos(χy )
divergence occurs. It turns out that the derivatives do not
vanish only when Kc , Ec , Lc = K, E, L. I thus choose
the congruence constants so that tetrad turning points occur
outside of the envelope of the spin-perturbed motion (note
that this also requires inserting an accordingly shifted connec(y)
tion into the turning-point formulae (48) so that XκC eκD →
κ
e0y eCκ;y eD |y=ygt ).
Let us now use the transformation (53) to express dy/dλ in
terms of dχr /dλ, dχϑ /dλ, and dφ/dλ, and we finally obtain
the functions fy , δfy so that dχy /dλ = fy + δfy
fy (χy ) = Yy0 ,

shown that no global choice of δy can transform these singularities away without introducing stronger ones. However,
these terms can be eliminated by holding the expressions for
dχy /dλ non-expanded in s. In return, one can then see that

where in the last equality I have used the Change of variables
theorem. One of the consequences of the formula above is the
fact that the only components of spin that end up having any
influence in long-term geodesic averages of quantities linear
in spin are s̃12 = −s̃21 = sk .

One last point to realize is the fact that averaging an O(s)
term over the spin-perturbed trajectory can be replaced by
geodesic averages up to O(s2 ). Consequently, all of the terms
in hn(y)isp are now expressible as closed-form averages over
the geodesics, which can be summarized as

I showed that the shifts to fundamental frequencies are
extracted from the system by computing geodesic averages.
However, I also have to show that the singularities in δfy do
not spoil the finiteness and non-ambiguity of the averages.
All of the averages with δfy we need to compute are of the
type hj(χy )δfy ig . We write

In other words, by using equation (A19) it is possible to
compute the shift to the fundamental frequencies without the
knowledge of a closed-form transformation to either of the an~ or Ψ.

Let us now briefly derive the general formula for averaging
of separable functions over the spin-perturbed trajectory. Assume that we want to compute the average of a quantity n(y),

the convergence of the sums given in (A21). In that case,
it is possible to instead hold dχy /dλ in non-expanded form
