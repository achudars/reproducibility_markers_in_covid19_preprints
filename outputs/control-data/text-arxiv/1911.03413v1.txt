Abstract. We investigate a contribution of the Jeans smoothing to the minimal width of Lyα
forest lines and discuss how the accounting for this additional broadening affects the inferred
parameters of the intergalactic matter equation of state. We estimate a power-law index γ of
the equation of state, a temperature at the mean density T0 and a hydrogen photoionization
rate Γ within 4 redshift bins. Furthermore, in each bin we obtain an upper limit on the scaleparameter fJ , which sets the relation between the Jeans length and the characteristic physical
size of the absorber clouds.

1. Introduction
It is believed that the effective equation of state (EOS) of the low-density intergalactic medium
(IGM) after the H i reionization obeys the power law [1]:
T = T0 ∆γ−1 ,

(1)

where T = T (ρ) is a temperature at a density ρ, T0 ≡ T (ρ̄) is the temperature at the mean
density ρ̄ of the Universe and ∆ ≡ ρ/ρ̄ is an overdensity. Evolution of the EOS, defined by a
dependence of T0 and a power-law parameter, γ, on a redshift, is determined by the dynamics of
the reionization processes. One of the widely used methods to probe the EOS is the statistical
analysis of the parameters of the Lyα forest lines observed in spectra of distant quasars [2–5].
This method exploits an assumption that the minimal broadening of the Lyα lines is due to
thermal motions of the absorbing atoms. However, it was suggested that the Hubble expansion
during the time that light crosses an absorber may result in the minimal line broadening that
depends not only on the thermal velocity distribution within the absorber, but also on its spatial
structure [6–8]. In other words, an observed broadening of the Lyα lines encodes an information
about the physical extent of the absorbers. In the present study we estimate a significance of
the additional broadening related to the Hubble expansion and obtain constraints on the EOS
parameters and the scale parameter between the Jeans length and the characteristic physical
size of low density IGM absorbing clouds from the analysis of the observed joint distribution of
column densities N and Doppler parameters b of Lyα forest absorbers.
2. Data and method
We obtained a large sample of Lyα forest lines in the redshift range z ∼ 2 − 4 in 47 highresolution (R ∼ 36000 − 72000) and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ∼ 20 − 100) quasar spectra
from KODIAQ1 [14] using the original fitting procedure, see [12, 15, 16] for details.

shown by the black open circles. Blue solid and red dashed
curves correspond to two different scenarios of the reionization from [9], namely, with
and without accounting for
the He ii reionization, respectively. We also show measurements from [3] (green triangles), [10] (blue filled squares),
[5] (yellow filled circles), [11]
(the cyan cross), [12] (the

For the analysis of the obtained sample we employed the method developed in our previous
works [12, 15, 16]. The method is based on the approximation of the (N, b) sample by the model

where bmin is the minimal broadening at a given N , badd is an additional broadening, accounting
for the turbulent and peculiar motions, fN (N ) and fadd (badd ) are distribution functions of Lyα
absorbers over N and badd , respectively. It is well established, that fN (N ) has a power-law
shape, fN (N ) ∝ N −β (e.g. [17, 18]). For fadd (badd ) we also assumed a power-law behaviour
∝ bpadd (for the discussion of this choice, see [15, 16]). Usually one suggests that the minimal
broadening of the absorption lines is determined predominantly by the thermal contribution.
Here we investigate the model proposed by Garzilli et al [7, 8], where the minimal broadening

with the parameters of the effective EOS. To construct the model for obtained data sample,
we write the likelihood function based on eq (2) and take into account the presence of outliers
as we did in [15]. The model parameters are γ, T0 , Γ, fJ and nuisance parameters p, β and a

parameter, which characterises a fraction of outliers, thus 7 parameters in total2 . The parameters
γ, T0 , Γ and fJ are strongly correlated [8] which complicates their measurements. To reduce the
uncertainty, we use an additional constraint based on the measurements of the effective optical
depth of the Lyα forest, τeff (z). This quantity is inferred from the mean transmission of the Lyα
forest averaged over many quasars spectra, see [23]. The effective optical depth can be expressed
via the local optical depth τ and the gas probability density distribution P (∆, z) as [19]

τeff (z) = − ln

Following [19], we use the analytical function for the gas probability density distribution, taken
from [24]. In principle, the local optical depth τ (z) depends on the spatial extent of an absorber,
as discussed above [8]. However, when the averaging of the different lines of sight is performed,
the spatial structures are smeared out and the local Gunn-Peterson approximation [19, 25] is
applicable.
In our calculations we assumed a standard ΛCDM cosmology with matter, dark energy
and baryon density parameters Ωm = 0.28, ΩΛ = 0.72 and Ωb = 0.046, respectively, and
H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 [26].

Notice, that in [15] we shared the nuisance parameters between the bins. Further analysis have shown that this
can lead to the systematic shift in the fit results. Therefore in the present work we discard this sharing.

Dark and light filled areas correspond to the 68 and 95 per cent credible regions, respectively.
3. Results
We split our data into 4 redshift bins with nearly the same number of absorption lines (375 lines
in each bin) and estimated parameters in question using the Bayesian framework with the affine
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler emcee [27]. Flat priors on the parameters were
used. The fit summary is given in table 1. Reported uncertainties correspond to the 68 per
cent highest probability density intervals. Dependencies of the γ − 1, T0 and Γ on z are shown
in the upper and bottom panels in figure 1 and in the bottom panel in figure 2, respectively,
and compared with measurements by other authors. For the scale parameter fJ we were able
to estimate only the upper limits as shown in the top panel in figure 2. Estimated cutoffs
bmin (N ) of the (b − N ) distribution are shown for four redshift bins by solid lines in figure 3.
Grey areas correspond to the 68 per cent intervals for bmin (N ) obtained from the MCMC chain.
Contribution of the thermal broadening to the total bmin is indicated by the dashed green line.
By the dotted blue line in figure 3 we show the cutoff of the distribution, as measured neglecting
the Jeans smoothing, i.e. assuming bmin = bth . A comparison between parameters γ in case of
nonzero and zero Jeans smoothing contribution is presented in last two columns in table 1.
4. Discussion and conclusions
Using the technique of the (b − N ) distribution analysis, developed in our previous works
[12, 15, 16], we constrained evolution of the parameters of the IGM EOS taking into account
the Jeans smoothing contribution to the minimal width of an absorption line. To reduce an
impact of the correlations between the parameters, we impose additional constraints based on the
measurements of the effective optical depth from [19]. An example of the marginalized posterior

distributions of the parameters with evident strong correlations between γ −1, T0 and Γ is shown
in figure 4. Although we used additional constraints, the correlations between the parameters are
still sizeable. At present, we can give only the upper limits on the Jeans smoothing parameter fJ ,
which is found to be . 1.7 in all cases. To make more certain conclusions about the significance
of the Jeans smoothing contribution, it is required to impose additional restrictions on the
physical sizes of the absorbers. As seen in figure 3, dashed lines, the thermal contribution in our
model is primarily constrained by high column density regions, where the number of absorbers is
relatively small. This is in contrast with the pure thermal model, bmin = bth , where the densest
regions of the b − N plane (i.e. with small N values, see dotted lines in figure 3) determine bth .
That means that the neglect of the Jeans smoothing contribution may lead to underestimation
of the EOS power-law index γ (table 1, see also bottom left panel in figure 4). Moreover we do
not find a statistically significant evolution of the EOS parameters with z, see figures 1 and 2.
This also differs from the case when the pure thermal broadening is assumed, e.g. [15]. Notably,
we do not obtain inverted EOS (γ < 1), see table 1 and figure 1, top panel. We conclude that
the inference of the EOS parameters from the b − N distribution is influenced by the finitude of
the IGM filament and this needs to be taken into account [7, 8]. Unfortunately, the correlation
between the Jeans smoothing parameter and the parameters of the effective EOS at present do
not allow to track their evolution, although the results are in agreement within uncertainties
with previous studies. One expects much better constraints with an increase of the sample size,
i.e. the number of the lines of sight probed in high resolution spectra of the quasars, especially
in the high-N region.
