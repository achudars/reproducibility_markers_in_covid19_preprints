Abstract: Polymer composite electrolytes of Nafion and phosphotungstic acid (PWA) are
fabricated and analyzed using electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) and conductive atomic
force microscopy (C-AFM) to visualize hydrophilic ion channels near the surface, which are
composed of water and sulfonic acid groups. The results indicate that the fibrillar objects in
ESM image, without significant changes in topography, are hydrophilic ion channels and
additional ion channels formed by interaction between PWA and sulfonic groups in Nafion. In
this study, the buried ion channels lying under the surface are probed as well as the inlet and
outlet of the channels on the surface through combined use of ESM and C-AFM. The results
further enhance the understanding of ionic conduction in composite polymer electrolytes in
various fields.

Nafion membranes, due to high proton conductivity, selective permeability to water, and
excellent chemical stability, have drawn considerable attention as a polymer electrolyte in
various fields from energy applications to bio-inspired and biomedical applications.[1–11]
Nafion membranes show a bi-continuous nanostructure containing a hydrophobic matrix and
hydrophilic water-ion channels that allow transport of ions and water.

[3,6,12–15]

The

nanostructure within the membranes is of significant research interest because it is intimately
related to the ion transport, which consequently affects the functionality for various
applications from fuel cells to artificial muscles. [13]
HPA (Heteropoly acid) is a class of acid made up of a particular combination of
hydrogen and oxygen with certain metals and non-metals and a subset of well-known inorganic
metal oxides. The most thoroughly studied HPAs is H3PW12O3 (PWA; phosphotungstic acid),
which consists of a centrally located, four-coordinate phosphorus linked via oxygen atoms to
12 tungsten-oxygen.[16] Due to high intrinsic proton conductivity and good water retention,
PWA is widely used in hybrid organic-inorganic composite electrolytes for fuel cell
application.[17–21] The addition of PWA redistributes the hydrophilic channels to a more
interconnected morphology due to the interfacial interaction between PWA and side chain of
Nafion. PWA insertion in Nafion membranes increases the number of active sites in the
membrane, as well as the number of water molecules by the addition of sulfonic groups, which
results in the improvement of proton transport through the membrane and the electrochemical
properties of the membrane.[18,22–24]
There have been many research reports on the nanostructures within the membranes
using experimental methods such as X-ray scattering and computer simulation tools.[3,14,25–27]
In these studies, researchers concluded that the long-range nano-channels composed of
aggregated and hydrated ionic groups are embedded in a continuous matrix.[25,28] Atomic force
microscopy (AFM) is a promising strategy for imaging the morphology, mechanical and

2

electrochemical properties at the nanoscale. Especially, conductive AFM has been used to
probe local conductivity and the distribution and density of ionic clusters.[29–33] By applying
bias voltage across the membrane using a conductive AFM tip, the local currents produced by
ionic and electronic currents inside the membranes were measured. However, it is a challenging
task to obtain only ionic transport component from the electrical current signal.
Alternative solution is to use electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) that can
measure the bias-induced strain change on a surface using a conductive AFM tip. ESM has
been used extensively to study lithium ion diffusion in lithium-conducting ceramics for battery
applications.[34–39] Recent investigation demonstrated that the proton distribution and
relaxation behavior in Nafion could be visualized and the local strain caused only by ions could
be measured using ESM techniques.

[40]

Herein, we employ ESM as a tool for imaging

simultaneously the topography and the local strain change caused by the electric field. By
imaging the local strain, we could visualize the ion channels buried beneath the surface, thereby
visualizing the nanostructure of Nafion/PWA composite membrane.
Figure 1 shows the simultaneously obtained topography, ESM amplitude and phase
images of composite membrane of phosphotungstic acid (PWA) and Nafion. At a glance, the
ESM amplitude and phase show similar features when compared with the topography.
However, a careful observation reveals that fibrillar objects with various lengths are found
where there are no significant changes in topography. We speculate that these objects are
hydrophilic ion channels because their shape and size are similar to thin string-like channels in
the free bulk-like water distribution measured by atomic force microscope infraredspectroscopy (AFM-IR) chemical imaging

[41]

. The discrepancies between channel sizes

measured by AFM-IR, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)

and ESM could be due to the

The fibrillar objects clearly show higher amplitude and phase values than those of
matrix as shown in Figure 1(d) and (e), which suggests that more water and protons exist near
the fibrillar objects. [40] There are three major peaks in ESM phase (see blue arrows in Figure
1(e)), which show no significant topography changes. In addition, three amplitude peaks (see
red arrows in Figure 1(d)) were observed at the same location of the phase peaks. Our results
support the claim that these objects are hydrophilic ion channels, which are composed of water
and sulfonic acid groups in Nafion. No topography changes in these regions indicate that these
ion channels are buried below the sample surface. Consequently, we observed the buried
hydrophilic ion channels using ESM.
To confirm that the fibrillar objects in ESM images are hydrophilic ion channels, the
morphology and current images of Nafion/PWA (3 wt%) composite were simultaneously
obtained as shown in Figure 2(a) and (b). The current distribution in Figure 2(b) is spatially
inhomogeneous. The current is associated with an electrochemical reaction at the tip and proton
flow through the membrane as well as the transport of either electrons or holes. First of all, the
current image shows similar features when compared with the topography. To figure out the
relationship between the current and topography, the line profile of height and current at the
same position is presented in Figure 2(c). There is no significant relevance between
topography and current.
The areas with high (> 120 nA) current are presented in Figure 2(d), where no fibrillar
objects were found. Instead, we could find circular bright spots in the current images as shown
in Figure 2(d). The bright spots show the places where the AFM tip directly contacts the ionic
networks. As the C-AFM detects only the currents that flow out of the surface, the bright spots
indicate either the inlet or outlet of the ionic channels if the current comes solely from the
proton transport. It should be noted, however, that the bright spots in the current images could
be due to the electron or hole flow from e.g. impurities at the sample surface. In conductive

4

AFM, it is very difficult to distinguish the ionic and electronic contribution to the current signal,
whereas ESM identifies the motion of ions that contribute to the local strain (see Table 1).
To explain these results, we present a schematic of contrast mechanisms responsible
for the images we obtained in Figure 3 (a) and (b). Nafion consists of hydrophilic water-ion
channels and crystallites in non-crystalline matrix. We simplify the 3D structure near the
membrane surface as schematically illustrated in Figure 3 (c). ESM and C-AFM image could
be obtained by scanning AFM tip with bias voltage. Here, we assumed that AFM tips with bias
voltage scanned the line (d) that shows the cross-sectional image of our membrane containing
buried ion channel near the surface. Figure 3 (e) shows the expected ESM signal, contributed
to by the local strain induced by sub-surface ion. The current signal will be detected by only
direct contact to ionic channels at the surface. Therefore, the expected current signals will show
only inlet and outlet of the channel, which are depicted in Figure 3 (f). Although AFM tips
scan the same area, ESM can probe the whole fibrillar ion channels lying under the surface,
whereas C-AFM detects the inlet of outlet of the channels on the surface due to different
sources of signal. Using ESM and C-AFM altogether, we could visualize the fibrillar ion
channels near Nafion surface as well as those exposed to surface, leading to a complete map of
ionic channels near the surface.
In summary, we demonstrated that ESM is an effective technique for visualizing
hydrophilic ion channels near the surface of membranes. Using ESM, we could visualize the
fibrillar ion channels near the surface, which are composed of water and sulfonic acid groups
in Nafion. Besides these channels, the other ion channels might be formed by the interaction
between phosphotungstic acid and sulfonic groups in Nafion. Overall, these results show that
combined use of ESM and C-AFM can be a powerful in-situ tool for probing spatially
distributed nanoscale ionic channels and further provide insight into improving performance
of these materials in various applications, including fuel cells and artificial muscles.

Experimental Section
We used commercially available 10% Nafion solution (Dupont DE-1021) and
phosphotungstic acid hydrate (PWA; H3PW12O40•xH2O) – (Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were
prepared by recast procedure. The solvents of Nafion solution were exchanged by high boiling
point solvent (DMF; Dimethylformamide). PWA (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 wt% based on solid Nafion) was
dispersed in DMF by stirring to avoid particle aggregation. We added the PWA dispersed
solution to Nafion solution and mixed them for 24 hours. Then the mixed solution was poured
onto a casting mold. The solution in the mold was dried at 80 °C for 12 hours and cured at
120 °C for 6 hours. Fabricated membranes in the mold were peeled off from the mold surface.
To remove their organic and inorganic impurities on the surface, the membranes were
immersed in 2 N HCl (HCl : Hydrochloric acid) for 30 min at 80 °C. We immersed the
membranes in water for 30 min at 80 °C to clean and hydrate them. The hydrated membranes
were dried at 70 °C for 12 hours in vacuum oven.
ESM measurement was performed under ambient conditions using a commercial
atomic force microscopy; AFM (XE-100, Park Systems) equipped with a lock-in amplifier
(SR830, Stanford Research System) using Pt/Ir coated cantilevers (ATEC-CONTPt tip,
NANOSENSORS). To enhance the sensitivity of the measurement, ESM measurements were
conducted at contact resonance frequency. The high frequency ac voltage (0.7 Vpk at 53 ~ 56
KHz) was applied to the samples to measure their electromechanical response. A typical scan
rate used for the measurements was 0.3 Hz. Current imaging under sample bias voltage of -2
V was also performed using commercial AFM (XE-100) using Pt/Ir coated cantilevers with
scan rate of 0.5 Hz.
