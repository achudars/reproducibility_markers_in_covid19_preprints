Noble metal surfaces (Au, Ag and Cu etc.) have been extensively studied for the Shockley type
surface states (SSs). Very recently, some of these Shockley SSs have been understood from the
topological consideration, with the knowledge of global properties of electronic structure. In this
letter, we show the existence of Dirac like excitations in the elemental noble metal Ru, Re and Os
based on symmetry analysis and first principle calculations. The unique SSs driven Fermi arcs have
been investigated in details for these metals. Our calculated SSs and Fermi arcs are consistent with
the previous transport and photo-emission results. We attribute these Dirac excitation mediated
Fermi arc topology to be the possible reasons behind several existing transport anomalies, such
as large non-saturating magneto resistance, anomalous Nernst electromotive force and its giant
oscillations, magnetic breakdown etc. We further show that the Dirac like excitations in these
elemental metal can further be tuned to three component Fermionic excitations, using symmetry
allowed alloy mechanism.

Symmetry protected multi-fold band crossings in momentum space often exhibit strong topological response
in the transport measurement. A four-fold Dirac node1
splits into a pair of two-fold Weyl nodes2 under magnetic field, which in turn shows several anomalous transport signatures; such as anomalous Hall effect (AHE),3–6
anomalous Nernst effect (ANE),7–9 non-saturating large
magneto-resistance (LMR),10–12 chiral anomaly13–16 etc.
A pair of opposite monopole charges are created upon
the separation of Weyl nodes under either inversion or
time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking conditions. Each
of the Weyl nodes are associated with the source or
sink of Berry curvature in momentum space.17,18 While
this fictitious magnetic field like Berry curvature couples to the external magnetic field, it gives rise to such
anomalous response in materials. Several Dirac and Weyl
semi-metals (DSM and WSM) have been proposed and
their topological signatures have been extensively investigated through photo-emission and transport measurements. Another type of quasi-particle excitation, different from DSM and WSM is triple point semi-metal
(TPSM) states.19–25 TPSM is believed to be an intermediate phase of relatively higher symmetric DSM and
lower symmetric WSM. The topological index for TPSM
is still a matter of debate,26,27 hence it has become a fertile ground for the topological study in the recent times.
In the present study, we investigated the topological
electronic structures of hexagonal noble metals ruthenium (Ru), rhenium (Re) and osmium (Os) based on
symmetry analysis and first principle calculations (see
sec. I of supplemental Material (SM)28 for details of computational method). These systems although look simple on the onset, yet some of their properties are quite

puzzling and still leaves proper understanding. One of
the main motivation to choose these systems is to understand the rich physics behind the various anomalous
existing experimental results such as anomalous magneto transport effect,29,30 anomalous Nernst emf (and
their giant quantum oscillation),31 measured Fermi surface (FS),33 etc. Close inspection of these experimental
results made us speculate the topological origin of the
electronic structure of these systems to be responsible
for such anomaly. Indeed, our detailed calculations and
group theoretical analysis strongly indicate the existence
of symmetry protected multiple Dirac Fermionic excitations near the Fermi level (EF ). We choose Ru as a case
study and investigate both the bulk and surface band
topology in details. Our calculated Fermi surfaces (FS)
for Ru matches fairly well with the previously measured
experimental FS.32
Ru has been extensively studied for its unusual
magneto-transport properties under the so called necklens magnetic breakdown.29,30 For instance, it shows nonsaturating LMR in perpendicular magnetic field30 which
is somewhat similar to these in topological semi-metals.
Several theories have been proposed to address the origin
of such LMR. They are−(i) linear band crossing36–38 in
momentum space as in the case of Cd3 As2 , Na3 Bi and so
on, (ii) perfect electron-hole (e-h) compensation39–42 in
WSMs; WTe2 , MoTe2 , PtSn4 and LaSb (although LaSb
has trivial band ordering, multiple Weyl type nodes are
present in its band dispersion43 ), and (iii) Lipschitz transition (LT) of Fermi surface (FS)42 (recently, LT has been
found in several topological materials where the phase
transition does not break any symmetries but can be
described by topological invariants). Apart from afore-

mentioned theories, a topology driven non-trivial origin
for the non-saturating LMR has also been predicted by
Tafti et al.44 Another interesting feature of Ru is that
it shows finite Nernst emf which shows giant oscillation
in high filed regime.31 The characteristic curve and the
oscillation patterns are quite similar to the non-trivial
material Bi2 Se3 and very different from the Drude like
behavior.31,34 Keeping these facts in mind, our study reveals the appearance of Dirac surface states (SSs) mediated Fermi arcs on the surface of noble metals (Ru,
Re and Os) which is found to be the key origin in understanding the existing problem of transport anomalies.
Note that the controversial Shockley type SSs that appear on the surface of noble metals; such as gold (Au),
silver (Ag), copper (Cu), platinum (Pt) and palladium
(Pd), have recently been interpreted as topologically derived surface states.35
Symmetry argument has become a very important tool
to explore the material physics in recent time. The
knowledge of symmetry provides constraint or consent
over the tunability of topological phases. We use the
crystalline symmetry breaking argument to tune the
DSM phase to TPSM phase using alloy mechanism. For
example, both Ru and Os show Dirac nature owing to the
center of inversion (IS) and C6 rotation symmetry. However, the binary alloy RuOs breaks the IS and transforms
the C6 into C3 rotation, which converts the Dirac like excitations to three component Fermionic excitations. The
most important advantages of such symmetry adopted
tunability is that we can shift the nodal points very close
EF depending on the crystal composition. As such, we
have a freedom on the position of the nodal points as well
as tunability of the low energy excitations.
Ru, Re and Os, in their elemental phase, crystallize
in hexagonal-close-packed structure with P63 /mmc space
group and D6h point group. The crystal structure and
Brillouin zones (BZ) are shown in Fig. 1(a,b). The twoatom unit cell with particular uniaxial rotational symmetry results more complex electronic Fermi surface topology than the cubic noble metals (Au, Ag, Pt, etc). The

presence of D6h point group allow a C6v little group along
Γ-A direction in BZ. The symmetry elements that C6v
contain are identity (E) operation, six (C6 ), three (C3 )
& two-fold (C2 ) rotational symmetry about z-axis, three
vertical mirror plane (σv ) and three σd mirror plane (σd
bisect two σv mirror). Under spin-orbit coupling scheme,
π
π
π
C˜6 possess six eigenvalues, namely, e±i 6 , e±i 3 , ei 2 , eiπ .
The corresponding eigen states for the C˜6 rotation operator can be denoted as ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , ψ4 , ψ5 , and ψ6 (see
Fig. S1 of SM28 ). Now, the σ̃v (x-axis mirror) and C˜6 do
not commute and thus cannot be simultaneously diagonalizable in the eigen space of C˜6 operator. The mirror
σ̃v keeps the ψ5 , and ψ6 invariant, i.e, σ̃v ψ5 = ψ5 and
σ̃v ψ6 = ψ6 whereas ψ1 will convert to ψ2 and ψ3 will
convert to ψ4 under the action of σ̃v , i.e, σ̃v ψ1 = ψ2 and
σ̃v ψ3 = ψ4 . As the Γ-A direction is invariant under these
symmetries, the non-commutating condition of σ̃v and C˜6
enforces to form doubly degenerate eigen space by ψ1 +ψ2
π
(Γ7 representation designated by e±i 6 eigenvalues) and
π
ψ3 +ψ4 (Γ8 representation designated by e±i 3 eigenvalues) along Γ-A. Furthermore, ψ5 and ψ6 form a degenπ
erate state (Γ9 representation designated by ei 2 and eiπ
eigenvalues) under the action of time reversal symmetry
(TRS), C2 and σd symmetry. As C˜2 and σ̃d commute,
we can define a new operator, θ=C˜2 σ̃d . In spin rotation
space, θ2 = 1. In the presence of TRS, eventually now
we have, T 2 θ2 = −1. This is the local Kramer’s theorem,
which guaranteed the double degeneracy at every point
along Γ-A direction in BZ as this direction is invariant
under both C˜2 and σ̃d . Now, the two bands having different irreducible representations cross each other along
C6 axis will form a gapless four fold degenerate Dirac
nodes. For Ru, Γ7or9 band intersects with Γ8 band and
form two Dirac nodes on the C6 rotation axis as shown in
Fig. 1(c). Similar observations and mechanisms have also
been observed for Re and Os which will be discussed later
in the manuscript. Furthermore, in addition to the above
C6v symmetry element, the elements Ru, Re and Os also
holds structural inversion. Interplay of inversion symmetry and TRS further ensures Kramer’s double degeneracy
throughout the BZ. Hence, two doubly degenerate bands
belong to different IRs while crossing each other along C6
direction form a Dirac node and hence the hybridization
at the nodal point is prohibited by group orthogonality
relations. As such, presence of inversion center provides
extra crystalline symmetry protection to the Dirac nodes
in addition to C6v . Therefore, the Dirac nodes are stable
against inversion breaking perturbation in the presence
of C6v symmetry.
The origin of the surface states (SSs) in noble metals
(Au, Ag and Cu etc.) can be traced back to Shockley’s
prediction45 of SSs which appear inside an inverted energy gap due to band crossing.46,47 Very recently, some
of these Shockley’s SSs have been understood from the
topological consideration, with the knowledge of global
properties of electronic structure.35 Another type of SSs,
called Rashba SSs, appear due to the absence of transla-

tional symmetry on the surface which is quiet a common
phenomenon on noble metal surfaces. It is to be noted
that these Rashba SSs are unlike the conventional Rashba
states which arises due to the breaking of inversion symmetry (in the presence of spin-orbit coupling) in bulk
systems. Although, these Shockley or Rashba SSs can
be explained from the free electron theory, but a rigorous topological understanding is required to capture various other anomalous surface behaviors. For example, recently, Zak phase driven large surface polarization charge
and flat SSs have been understood from the non-trivial
Berry phase in topological Dirac nodal line fcc alkaline
earth metals; calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr) and ytterbium
(Yb).48 Topological nature of Beryllium (Be) have also
been explored which indeed shed light on the long standing controversial issues of Be, such as strong deviations
from the description of the nearly free-electron theory,
anomalously large electron-phonon coupling effect,49 and
large Friedel oscillations etc.50
In the above context, Ru, Re and Os are unique as
their Dirac like bulk band crossing suggests the appearance of non-trivial surface dispersion and Fermi arc topology onto the surface. Since in DSMs, the main focus is
the surface states and the associated Fermi arcs that link
the Dirac points, we have investigated the FS map for
both (001) and (010) surfaces for Ru as shown in Fig. 2.
Bulk projected SSs on (001) surface is shown in Fig. 2(a).
Bulk electronic structure of Ru suggest the appearance
of a pair of Dirac nodes (crossing point of Γ7or9 , and Γ8
bands as shown in Fig. 1(c)) along Γ-A direction). The
projection of these two Dirac nodes on (001) surface fall

on Γ point in the surface BZ (as shown in Fig. 1(b)).
Moreover, in the energy scale, the positions of two Dirac
nodes are separated by a small value. Projection of one
Dirac node in energy scale is depicted by blue dot in
Fig. 2(a). The Dirac like surface states (DSSs), emerging from the Dirac nodes in (001) surface is shown in
Fig. 2(a). However, the other Dirac node is buried by
the bulk Fermi pockets near the Γ point. Nonetheless,
the Fermi arcs for two Dirac nodes can be clearly encapsulated little far from the Γ point along M (K) direction
(see Fig. 2(a)) as indicated by DSS1 and DSS2.
The FS maps on (001) surface have been investigated
and the evolution of FS topology is observed for three different energy cuts (E1, E2 and E3) as shown in Fig. 2(bd). At energy cut E1, the Dirac SSs, DSS1 and DSS2 are
little immersed by bulk bands near Γ, hence we do not
observe the clear signature of Dirac SSs mediated FS map
at this constant energy cut. However, the signatures and
contour patterns of DSSs mediated FS maps are clearly
observed for other two energy cuts at E2 and E3 as described in Fig. 2(c,d). The two concentric Fermi arcs in
Fig. 2(d) are indicated by arc1 and arc2. A similar pattern for FS have earlier been observed by photo-emission
spectroscopy on the hexagonal surface of MoP,20 MoC,21
LuPtBi,51 etc. Most importantly, the FS for Ru is highly
consistent with the previous experiments both by Angleresolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) and de
Haas−van Alphen (dHV) oscillation.32,33 However, the
explanation based on topological origin of the FS maps
in those experiments is lacking.

Furthermore, the DSSs mediated Fermi arc topology,
can also be observed on the side surface (010 plane) of
Ru. The Γ and A(L) point of bulk BZ fall onto the Γ and
Z point on surface BZ (SBZ) of (010) surface. As such,
the projected Dirac nodes fall on the Γ- Z line segment
in (010) SBZ. A time reversal pair of Dirac nodes is situated on both sides of the Γ point along Γ- Z line. In the
momentum space, a Fermi arc is nested in between this
pair of Dirac nodes as shown in Fig. 2(e-g). Figure 2(e-g)
shows the Fermi arc topology on the side surface of Ru
for three different energy cuts. For the energy cut very
close to Dirac nodes (as shown in Fig. 2(e)), two arcs
originated from two pair of Dirac nodes are almost degenerate (since, two nodal points are situated very closely
in momentum space). As we move away from the Dirac
nodes, the two arcs get resolved (Fig. 2(f), 2(g)). We
have discussed and compared, in detail, our calculated
Fermi arcs with the previously measured ARPES and
transport results in section III of SM28 . The close similarity of calculated Fermi arc topology (in both (001)
and (010) surfaces) with the measured data validate our
theoretical predictions.
We now discuss the origin of these SSs and arcs from
the topological perspective. A DSM phase is the parent
sate of WSM and topological insulator (TI). TI phase can
be achieved by opening up a non-trivial gap at the nodal
points. In such a case, presence of SSs is guaranteed
by topological Z2 index. On the other hand, two Weyl

nodes with opposite chern number sit together to form a
Dirac node in momentum space under the precise symmetry enforcement. Such degeneracies of Weyl nodes form
a ”doubly-degenerate” Fermi arc in DSM phase. However, such type of Fermi arcs may not be protected by
topological index. Nevertheless, a crystalline symmetry
protected three dimensional DSM phase is stable as long
as the symmetries are intact.
Further, the alloy driven crystalline symmetry breaking allows us to realize three component Fermionic excitation near EF , which is different from the Dirac excitation in pure metals Ru, OS and Re. For the binary alloys,
e.g. RuOs, the point group symmetry reduces from D6h
to D3h . D3h allows it’s C3v subgroup symmetry along
Γ-A direction. The symmetry elements that C3v contain
are E, C3 and three σv (see Fig. S3 of SM28 ). Similar
to earlier explained C6v case, the non-commutation relation of C̃3 and σ˜v (say, x-axis mirror) allows two singly
degenerate states (denoted by Γ5 and Γ6 ) and one doubly degenerate state (denoted by Γ4 ) along Γ-A direction in spin-orbit space. The operation of C3 and σv
does not alter momentum co-ordinate along kz -axis. Any
accidental band crossing of Γ5or6 with Γ4 along kz -axis
forms a triply degenerate nodal point (TDNP). In particular, such an alloying, transforms the crystalline symmetry from C6v (elemental metal) to C3v (binary alloy
with space group P6̄m2) and the corresponding band representation changes as; Γ8,7 → Γ4 and Γ9 → Γ5 ⊕ Γ6 .
Further, the strength of Γ5,6 band splitting and the slop
of Γ4 band collectively determine the number of TDNP
(two or four in our binary alloys) on the C3 rotation axis.
Figure 3(a,b) shows a case study on the bulk band structure of RuOs alloy. Four triple points are observed in
RuOs alloy and they are denoted by T1, T2, T3 and T4
in Fig. 3(b). Note that, TDNPs are protected by group
orthogonality relations of different IRs. We have also simulated the Fermi arcs nesting on (010) rectangular surface of RuOs alloy, which host triple point (semi)metallic
state (see Fig. 3(c)). All the TDNPs are projected along
the Γ − Z axis on both sides of Γ point. The Fermi arcs
are originated and nested between the TDNPs as shown
in Fig. 3(c). The existence of such TDNP induced Fermi
arcs on a particular surface is a hallmark of TPSM state
for their experimental detection.
To get the ideal candidates (in terms of the position
of Dirac points (DPs) and TDNPs with respect to EF ),

we have simulated the band structure of other metals
(Os and Re) and their alloys (ReRu and ReOs). The
band structures along the six(three) fold rotation axis
are shown in Fig. 4. In Table I, we have also listed the
compounds with the number of nodal points and their relative position in terms of energy. The spin-orbit coupling
strength of Os is highest among these three pure metals,
hence the splitting between Γ7 and Γ9 is largest which
in turn results in a larger separation of DPs for Os in
momentum space as shown in Fig. 4(b). For ReOs alloy,
the nodal points (TDNPs) lie close to EF as compared to
other two alloys, ReRu and RuOs. Furthermore, ReOs
only has a single pair of TDNPs, as shown in Fig. 4(d).
In order to investigate the possibilities of the experimental synthesis for these binary alloys, we have checked
the chemical and mechanical stability of these compounds. Chemical stability is checked by calculating the
formation energies using the following formula,
∆Ef orm = EComp −

i=1

where EComp is the total energy of the binary alloy, Ei
represents the energy of the constituent elements in their
ground state phase, and xi is the proportion of ith element in the binary compound. The formation energy
∆Ef orm of these three binary alloys is presented in Table II. The negative value of ∆Ef orm confirms the chemical stability of these alloys.
Apart from chemical stability, the elastic behavior of
a lattice is described by its second-order elastic constant

The condition on C66 is redundant for hexagonal systems with the C11 and C12 given by the equation, C66 =
(C11 − C12 )/2.
The values of the elastic constants for the three binary
alloys (Re-Os, Re-Ru and Ru-Os) are listed in Table III.
These values of elastic constants clearly satisfy the conditions, Eq. 1, and hence confirms the mechanical stability
of the three alloys.
The conclusion of this work is mainly three folds; (i)
we predict the existence of symmetry protected Dirac
sates in pure elemental metals Ru, Os and Re. We
find the unique Dirac like Fermi arc topology on the
(001) and (010) surfaces of these metals. Our calculated Fermi surfaces are consistent with the previous
experiments by ARPES and transport measurements.
(ii) The presence of such topologically non-trivial Fermi
arcs can re-evaluate the understanding behind several
anomaly in such metals. We speculate these topological nature of bands in Ru to be responsible for several
puzzling behavior such as magnetic break down, large
magneto-resistance similar to DSM compound Cd3 As2 ,
giant Nernst oscillation (similar to Bi2 Se3 ) and deviations from the description of the Drude theory. (iii) By
precise symmetry breaking alloy engineering, the Dirac
excitations can be tuned to three component fermion excitations. Depending on the combinations, we get two or
four pairs of TDNPs along Γ-A directions. The position
of TDNPs are very closer to EF (for RuRe and ReOs

6
alloy) which definitely enable the strong topological response in transport experiments. Finally, these types of
transition metal alloys are extensively synthesized and
investigated in the field of catalysis, hence our findings
open up a new direction towards that too.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

First principle calculations were carried out using projector augmented wave (PAW) formalism based on Density
Functional Theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).1–3 The generalizedgradient approximation by Perdew-Burke- Ernzerhof (PBE)1 was employed to describe the exchange and correlation.
Force (energy) criterion was set upto 0.01 eV/Å(10−6 eV). An energy cut off of 500 eV is used to truncate the planewave basis sets. The Brillouin zone (BZ) is integrated using 12×12×6 gamma centered k-mesh. Tight-binding (TB)
Hamiltonians were constructed using maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs)4–6 obtained from wannier90
package. The topological properties including surface spectrum and Fermi surface were analyzed based on the iterative
Green’s function method7–10 implemented in Wannier-Tools package.10

II.

FORMATION OF DIRAC STATES UNDER C6v

The presence of D6h point group allow a C6v little group along Γ-A direction in Brillouin zone (BZ). The symmetry
elements that C6v contain are identity (E) operation, six (C6 ), three (C3 ) & two-fold (C2 ) rotational symmetry about
z-axis, three vertical mirror plane (σv ) and three σd mirror plane (σd bisect two σv mirror). In spin-orbit space, C˜6
π

π
possess six eigenvalues, namely, e±i 6 , e±i 3 , ei 2 , eiπ . The corresponding eigenstates for the C˜6 rotation operator, are
ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , ψ4 , ψ5 , and ψ6 as shown in Fig. S1(a). Now, we have the commutation relations, [σ̃v , C˜6 ]6=0 and [σ̃v ,
C˜3 ]6=0. These two commutation relation gives the following relations,

and mirror invariant planes (b) schematic diagram of formation of four-fold band crossings. Bands are represented by their
rotation eigen values.

σ̃v ψ3 = ψ4

Now, Hamiltonian (H) of the system commutes with the mirror σ̃v i.e, [H, σ̃v ] = 0 and H operating on ψ1 (ψ2 ) gives
eigenvalue E1 (E2 ). Further, operation of the commutator on eigenstate ψ1 follows;

H σ̃v ψ1 − σ̃v Hψ1
⇒ Hψ2 − E1 σ˜v ψ1
⇒ E2 ψ2 − E1 σ˜v ψ1
⇒ E2 ψ2 − E1 ψ2

=0
=0
=0
=0

(using

equation 1)

Thus, E1 = E2 . So, the energy eigen value corresponding to C˜6 rotation eigen states (ψ1 and ψ2 ) are same. Hence,
they form a degenerate eigen space (Γ7 representation) under the above symmetry. In the similar way, [σ̃v , C˜3 ]6=0 and
[H, σ̃v ]= 0 together ensure the degenerate eigen state of ψ3 and ψ4 (Γ8 representation). As all the points along Γ-A
direction are invariant under σ̃v , C˜6 and C˜3 , these Γ7 and Γ8 band representations are applicable along this direction
in BZ.
π
Furthermore, ψ5 and ψ6 form a degenerate state (Γ9 representation designated by ei 2 and eiπ eigenvalues) under
the action of TRS, C2 and σd symmetry. As [C˜2 , σ̃d ]= 0, we can define a new operator, θ=C˜2 σ̃d . In spin rotation
space, θ2 = 1. In the presence of TRS, eventually now we have, T 2 θ2 = −1. This is the local Kramer’s theorem, which
guaranteed the double degeneracy at every point along Γ-A direction in BZ as this direction is invariant under both
C˜2 and σ̃d . Now, the two bands having different irreducible representations cross each other along C6 axis, will form
a gap less four fold degenerate Dirac nodes. For Ru, Γ7or9 band intersects with another Γ8 band and form two Dirac
nodes on the C6 rotation axis. The pictorial representation of bands and the formation of Dirac nodes are shown in
Fig. S1(b).

COMPARISON OF THE SIMULATED FERMI ARCS WITH PREVIOUS ARPES RESULTS

In this section, we compare the topology of our simulated Fermi arcs of Ru (001) and (010) surfaces with the
previously measured angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results.11 The topology of our calculated Fermi surface for both surfaces are similar to that was mapped through ARPES measurements and transport
experiments.11,12 Fig. S2(a-d) shows the Fermi arcs of Ru (001) and (010) surface measured by ARPES. The solid
black lines are the calculated Fermi surfaces. The τ γ, and β bands in Fig. S2 are well captured in our calculations as
shown in Fig.2 (b-d) in the main text. The circular/elliptical Fermi surface in (001)/(010) surfaces around the Γ point
(Fig. S2 (a,c)) resemble with the Dirac Fermi arcs as predicted in our calculations. Please note that the calculated
Fermi arcs in Fig. S2 are corresponding to different Γ-A distance as mention in the caption of the Fig. S2.

FIG. S2. (Color online) Experimental Fermi surfaces of Ru (001) surface (a,b) and (010) surface (c,d) measured at 33K using
He Iα for (a,c) and He IIα for (b,d). The solid black lines indicate the calculated Fermi surfaces with K⊥ is equal to 30% and
50 % of Γ-A distance for (a,b) and 0% and 40 % of Γ-A distance for (c,d) respectively. This figure is reprinted from J. Electron

FORMATION OF TRIPLE POINT FERMION STATES UNDER C3v

C3v have identity (E), three-fold (C3 ) rotational symmetry about z-axis, and three vertical mirror plane (σv ) as
shown in Fig. S3(a). Similar to C6v , in case of C3v ,[σ̃v , C˜3 ]6=0 and [H,σ̃v ]= 0 ensure the degenerate eigen space of ψ2
and ψ3 (Γ4 representation). Absence of σd enforce to form non-degenerate representations Γ5 and Γ6 . Any accidental
band crossing Γ4 and Γ5or6 forms a triply degenerate nodal point as shown in Fig. S3(b).
