The temperature (T ) dependence of electrical resistivity in graphene has been experimentally
investigated between 10 and 400 K for samples prepared on various substrates; HfO2 , SiO2 and
h-BN. The resistivity of graphene shows a linear T -dependence at low T and becomes superlinear
above a substrate-dependent transition temperature. The results are explained by remote interfacial
phonon scattering by surface optical phonons at the substrates. The use of an appropriate substrate
can lead to a significant improvement in the charge transport of graphene.

Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon allotrope that
has excellent electrical properties and higher electron mobility compared to silicon1–3 . These properties make
graphene particularly interesting for many applications
in electronic devices4,5 . Understanding how the substrate
affects electron transport is also critical to achieving the
promise of intrinsic graphene. Many experimental studies show the resistivity of graphene is strongly dependent
on temperature above ∼200 K. Chen et al. attributed
this to the extrinsic scattering by surface phonons at the
substrate6 , suggesting the importance of substrate choice
for graphene devices. Recently, I-Tan et al. theoretically
investigated the dependence of the surface optical phonon
scattering in graphene on various substrates7 . For HfO2
substrate with lower surface optical phonon energy of
∼21 meV, the resistivity arising from the surface optical
phonon scattering was calculated to be ∼600 Ω at room
temperature for a Fermi energy EF of 100 meV, much
larger than ∼10 Ω calculated for an h-BN substrate7 .
Here we prepare graphene devices on three different substrates of HfO2 , SiO2 and h-BN, and report experimental
investigations of the effect of remote interfacial phonons
on the resistivity of graphene.
Experiments were performed with exfoliated graphene
on 300 nm-SiO2 /Si substrate8 . Graphene samples were
reliably identified as monolayers by means of Raman
spectroscopy.9,10 Figs. 1(a), (b) and (c) show optical images of graphene devices fabricated on HfO2 , SiO2 , and
h-BN, respectively. For the preparation of graphene on
HfO2 , 30 nm-thick HfO2 was deposited on a SiO2 /Si
substrate by using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and
graphene was transferred to the HfO2 film.11 For the
graphene device on h-BN, a 10 nm-thick flake of h-BN
was first exfoliated on a SiO2 /Si substrate, shown as
green in Fig. 1(c), and then the graphene was transferred
onto the h-BN flake. Electrodes were defined by using a
conventional electron-beam lithography technique, and
Pd(20 nm)/Au(30 nm) electrodes were deposited on top
of the graphene. The temperature T dependence of resistivity ρ was studied between 10 and 400 K in a liquid
helium system (Quantum Design PPMS).

graphene was larger on the HfO2 substrate for all applied
gate voltages. Near the charge neutrality point (CNP),
the resistivity of the graphene on HfO2 was five times
larger than that of the graphene on h-BN. The mobil-

To investigate the role of surface optical phonons in
more detail, we compare only the T -dependent part of
the resistivity, ∆ρ = ρ(T ) − ρ0 , for graphene samples
prepared on the three different substrates. In Fig. 2, we
plot ∆ρ, extracted from Fig. 1 for various T at n = 2 ×
1012 /cm2 . Note ∆ρ is much larger for the graphene on
HfO2 .
We analyze and fit the T -dependent resistivity ∆ρ by
separating into three different contributions to the resistivity as follows.
∆ρ(T, n) = ρac (T ) + ρRIP (T, n) + ρopt (T )

(1)

ρac (T ) is the resistivity due to acoustic phonon scattering, and is linearly proportional to T .18 It is independent
of carrier density n and is given by

ρac (T ) =

fitted by three different contributions to the resistivity; from

phonons (ρopt , green solid line).

ity in graphene, estimated from positive gate voltages at
T = 60 K, was ∼3000, ∼5000 and ∼17000 cm2 /Vs for
HfO2 , SiO2 , and h-BN substrates, respectively. In the
low-T limit, the resistivity saturated at a temperatureindependent value of ρ0 for all three substrates, consistent with previous studies of graphene on SiO2 .6,12,13 .
At n = 2 × 1012 /cm2 , we have ρ0 of 1533, 540, 305 Ω
for HfO2 , SiO2 , and h-BN, respectively. The contact resistance of the Pd electrodes is about 10 to 30 Ω.14–16
The residual resistivity ρ0 mainly originates from electron scattering with static impurities and point defects.
The h-BN substrate has an atomically smooth surface
with less charge traps and dangling bonds,17 and in addition possesses a larger surface optical phonon energy
of ∼101 meV, compared to ∼59 and ∼22 meV of SiO2
and HfO2 , respectively. Therefore, the observed higher
mobility and the smaller resistivity of the graphene on
the h-BN substrate can be expected.

Here kB is Boltzmann’s constant, with e and h being
the elementary charge and Planck constant, respectively.
ρs = 7.6 × 10−7 kg m−2 is the mass density of graphene.
vF = 106 m/s is the Fermi velocity and vs = 2.1×104 m/s
is the speed of sound. Red dotted lines in Fig. 2 indicate the contribution due to the acoustic phonon scattering and the slopes give the acoustic deformation potential DA = 30±3 eV, in good agreement with previous
reports.13,17–19 ∆ρ shows a linear dependence at lower T
and becomes superlinear at higher T , implying scattering with high-energy phonon modes. Note, whereas ∆ρ
follows a linear behavior up to ∼ 200 K for the graphene
on h-BN (Fig. 2(c)), it deviates from the linear dependence already well below 100 K for the graphene on HfO2
(Fig. 2(a)).
The second term, ρRIP (T , n), expresses the resistivity
contribution due to the scattering with remote interfacial
phonons in the substrates, and can be written as6,7,12

parameters B and α.6
In Fig. 3, the resistivity coefficient C is plotted as a
function of the charge carrier density. The dashed lines
represent fits with α = 0.84. The resistivity coefficient decreases as carrier density increases due to the charge carrier screening effect.24,25 The difference in C at the same
carrier density is partly related to the difference in effective distance d between the graphene and the substrate
for each device. Following the approach of Ref.
√ 7, and using the relation, B = 1.84 × 10−9 hF12 /de2 ( 2 + a)2 , we
obtain d ' 4.3, 1.4 and 1.3 Å for the graphene samples on
HfO2 , SiO2 , and h-BN, respectively. Here, F1 is the coupling parameter for the surface optical phonon mode and
a = e2 /(εavg πh̄vF ), with εavg being the average dielectric
permittivity of the air/graphene/substrate.7 Larger effective distance between the graphene and the HfO2 substrate is attributed to the roughness of the HfO2 after the
ALD growth. An atomic force microscope (AFM) study
shows much larger root-mean-square surface roughness
of 10-14 Å for our HfO2 substrates, compared to ∼5 and
1-2 Å for SiO2 , and h-BN, respectively.
The last term, ρopt (T ) is the resistivity component
due to electron scattering with the optical phonons of
graphene. A01 phonon mode at K point, longitudinal
(LO) and transverse optical (TO) phonon modes at Γ
point are considered. The A01 mode has an energy of
∼150 meV, and LO and TO modes have an energy of
∼200 meV. Owing to the relatively large energy, ρopt becomes important only above 300 K (Fig. 2). The resistivity induced by scattering between electrons and phonons
can be expressed as follows.26

of each mode are substituted to calculate the resistivity
component due to optical phonons.
In Fig. 4, we plot ρRIP as a function of temperature
for n = 2 × 1012 /cm2 (EF ∼ 170 meV). The resistivity
arising from the surface phonon scattering is much larger
for graphene on the HfO2 substrate. ρRIP becomes larger
than 10 Ω above 60 K for HfO2 , significantly at lower T ,
compared to 200 and 250 K for SiO2 and h-BN, respectively. At T = 300 K, it reaches ∼450 Ω for graphene
on the HfO2 , whereas it remains below ∼20 Ω for the hBN substrate. Surface optical phonon energies of HfO2 ,
SiO2 and h-BN are 21, 59 and 101 meV, respectively.
The smaller surface phonon energy for HfO2 explains in
general our results, yet larger d ∼ 4.3 Å for graphene on

4
HfO2 leads to the underestimation of ρRIP against values
from other two substrates with d ∼ 1.3 Å. Note ρRIP is
inversely proportional to the effective graphene-substrate
distance.
To compare our data with theoretical values from
Ref. 7, calculated for d = 3.4 Å, we normalize ρRIP to
the effective graphene-substrate distance of 3.4 Å and
display it in Fig. 5 as a function of the Fermi energy at
T = 300 K. ρ̃RIP decreases as the Fermi energy increases
because of the charge carrier screening effect24,25 . Our
data are well matched to the theoretically calculated values, verifying the role of the remote interfacial phonons.
Concerning the slight mismatch between our data and
the theoretical values, we ignored in our discussion the
out-of-plane (ZO) phonon mode in graphene. At ripples
or bubbles, graphene floats locally and the out-of-plane
ZO phonon mode (∼ 100 meV) may play a role.2,27 Also,
we neglected the temperature dependence of contact resistance. A linear T -dependence of contact resistance
was reported for Pd-graphene contact.16 This can result
in the overestimation of the acoustic deformation potential DA by ∼ 3 eV in our previous discussion. On the

other hand, the non-linear T -dependent term for contact
resistance is negligible.
In summary, we have studied the effect of surface optical phonons on the resistivity of graphene, prepared on
three different substrates, HfO2 , SiO2 , and h-BN. For the
h-BN substrate, with the larger surface optical phonon
energy, the acoustic phonon scattering dominates and the
resistivity shows a linear T -dependence up to 200 K and
then becomes superlinear. For the HfO2 substrate, with
the lower surface optical phonon energy, the remote interfacial phonon scattering strongly dominates and results in much larger resistivity at room temperature. Our
study suggests the use of an appropriate substrate can
lead to a significant improvement in the charge transport
of graphene.
