Abstract— Cancer analysis and prediction is the utmost
important research field for well-being of humankind. The
Cancer data are analyzed and predicted using machine
learning algorithms. Most of the researcher claims the accuracy of the predicted results within 99%. However, we show
that machine learning algorithms can easily predict with an
accuracy of 100% on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer
dataset. We show that the method of gaining accuracy is
an unethical approach that we can easily mislead the algorithms. In this paper, we exploit the weakness of Machine
Learning algorithms. We perform extensive experiments for
the correctness of our results to exploit the weakness of
machine learning algorithms. The methods are rigorously
evaluated to validate our claim. In addition, this paper
focuses on correctness of accuracy. This paper report three
key outcomes of the experiments, namely, correctness of accuracies, significance of minimum accuracy, and correctness
of machine learning algorithms.
Keywords: Machine Learning, Cancer, Breast Cancer, Prediction,

1. Introduction
The Cancer, took many lives, and still people are surrendering their lives in front of Cancer. The unpleasant truth
is that there is no permanent solution for Cancer till date.
However, the Scientists are still trying their level best to
save many lives and they are successful too. There are many
controversies on "whether a Cancer is a disease or not".
Many scientists claim that the Cancer is an unwanted cell
behavior due to some mutation. The Scientists believe that
the reason of being a Cancer victim may be a high body
mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical
activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use [1]. The definite reason
for Cancer is yet to be reported. Many cancer victims could
not survive. The cancer mortality is presented in Figure 1.
However, the modern technology is helping in saving lives of
human being from Cancer. For instance, machine learning.
The machine learning algorithm plays a vital role in Cancer
Computing. The machine learning algorithms are used to
analyze the probable presence of Cancer.
The machine learning algorithms are modified to achieve
better accuracy for many purposes, and researchers are
developing modern techniques to analyze the Cancer. Chen
et al. [2] reported accuracy of 83.0% in lung cancer using
Artificial Neural network (ANN) with 440 samples. Xu
et al. [3] reported an accuracy of 97% in breast cancer

using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 295 sample size.
Exarchos et al. [4] reported 100% accuracy in Oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) using their proposed method. Ahmad
et al. [5] compares three machine learning algorithms on
breast cancer, namely, Decision Tree (DT), ANN, and SVM.
DT, ANN, and SVM gives an accuracy of 93.6%, 94.7%, and
95.7% respectively using 547 samples.
From the above research results, some research questions
(RQ) arise which are given belowRQ1: How can we achieve 100% accuracy, using machine learning algorithms in prediction of Cancer?
Is it ethical?
RQ2: Can a machine learning algorithm be misled?
RQ3: Why does researcher emphasize on enhancing the
maximum accuracy? Is it really necessary for Cancer prediction?
RQ4: When can we believe or deploy the proposed
machine learning algorithm of a researcher based
on their research result?
The research questions are really difficult to answer. However, we critically analyze the research result based on our
research questions. RQ1 introduces another dimension to
think on machine learning algorithms. It forces to think on
ethical and unethical way of gaining accuracy. Similarly,
RQ2 also gives indications on the possible misleading of
machine learning algorithm. Most importantly, the RQ3
creates a controversial thoughts on maximum and minimum
accuracy. Interestingly, RQ4 emphasizes to think about the
reliability of the research result with machine learning
algorithms. Thus, these four RQs forces to rethink on the
machine learning algorithms in dangerous diseases, like
Cancer.
We neither present any propose a model nor have any
intention to increase the accuracy of the machine learning
algorithm. On the contrary, we exploit the behavior of
machine learning algorithms and its consequences. In this
paper, we present following key points• Experimentation results using WDBC dataset.
• Experimentation results using doubling the WDBC
dataset.
• Behavior of machine learning algorithms.
• Significance of minimum accuracy in dangerous diseases.
• Discloses unethical way of misleading the algorithms.
The paper is organized as follows- Section 2 discusses
on various machine learning approaches to predict Cancer.

2. Background
With the large amounts of cancer data available to
work with, machine learning methods have become a defacto standard of predicting cancer. Machine learning algorithms uncover and identify patterns and extract relationships
among the complex data. Prediction accuracy depends on
different parameters like patient’s age, stage of cancer,
medical history, lifestyle, food habits, gender, region based
factors, diagnosis histopathology, etc. [7]. The accuracy
of cancer prediction outcome has significantly improved
by 15%-20% in the last years, with the application of
ML techniques [8]. Kourou et al.[8] compares some of
these techniques for breast cancer prediction, namely Neural
Network (NN), Bayesian Network (BN), SVMs and DTs.
Barracliffe et al. [9] achieve of an 83.6% accuracy on breast
cancer using SVM. The age of the female breast cancer
victims are from 28 to 85 years. Surprisingly, Kesler et al.
[10] achieves 100% accuracy using Random Forest model

in breast cancer. In addition, there are numerous research on
various cancer types. Delen et al [11] compares the results
of decision tree and neural networks applied to the SEER
dataset, with the C5 decision tree having a 93.6%accuracy
compared to Neural Networks, with a 91.2%. Hamsagayathri
and Sampath [12] proposed a priority-based decision tree
which achieves 98.5% accuracy. Nguyen et al. [13] have
presented the application of random forest combined with
feature extraction applied to the diagnosis and prognosis of
breast cancer. Their testing accuracy averaged as one of the
highest, around 99.8%. Data set is first N-fold cross validated, estimation of Bayesian probability is done, followed
by estimation of feature ranking and value.

2.1 Importance of accuracy
Figure 4, and 5 shows the accuracy statistics of hundred
rounds on WDBC dataset. The statistics show that accuracy
never remains same for the same input data without changing
anything. Most of the article reports the maximum accuracy
of their algorithm. The maximum accuracy changes time
to time. Early conclusion of maximum accuracy with a few
runs is incorrect. Because, the accuracy always changes with
time. In addition, it is unreliable calculation of the mean
accuracy after 5 or 10 runs of their proposed model. A series

of experiments are conducted to evaluate the algorithms’
performance in terms of mean accuracy. Moreover, the minimum accuracy with two or three experiments to evaluate the
algorithms is incorrect. Because, sometimes the algorithms
give poor performance in minimum accuracy.
2.1.1 Significance of minimum accuracy
It is not required to report the maximum accuracy of a
Cancer prediction using a proposed system. The maximum
accuracy is in the best case scenario and the algorithm cannot
perform beyond that accuracy. It is not so important to
become a successful machine learning algorithm in a Cancer
or other life threatening diseases. The mean accuracy is an
important parameter to report the proposed machine learning
algorithms. It is very useful to study cancer disease and
to benchmark with other existing algorithm. Now, the most
important is the minimum accuracy. The minimum accuracy
is the worst case scenario. The worst case scenario dictates
the strength of the proposed machine learning algorithm. If
people can prove that the proposed system cannot go beyond
the minimum benchmark, then the proposed algorithm is
reliable. We cannot rely on the maximum accuracy report
in life threatening disease. Benchmarking using minimum
accuracy gives us more impact than benchmarking using
maximum accuracy. Let, Method X and Method Y give
result of m% and n% in maximum accuracy respectively
where m > n. Thus, the Method X is better than Method Y.
Let, Method X and Method Y give result of p% and q% in
minimum accuracy where p < q. In this case, the Method
Y is better than Method X. In a life threatening disease, we
cannot rely on Method X, since its minimum accuracy is
lower than Method Y.

We have experimented on a well-known standard dataset,
Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. The
dataset contains malignant and benign patients. The dataset
consists of 569 patients reports. Figure 2 depicts the data of
malignant patients and benign patient. The dataset contains
212 malignant and 357 benign cancers.
The WDBC dataset is used to exploit the machine learning
algorithms. We have conducted this rigorous experiment in
two phases which is listed as follows• Phase I: We input the original WDBC dataset to the
machine learning algorithms for 100 times and results
are plotted in the chart.

Phase II: We double the WDBC dataset by duplicating
the dataset and input to the machine learning algorithms. The outcome of the experiments is plotted in
chart.

4. Experimentations and Results
Figure 4 depicts the 100 rounds prediction accuracy of
Random Forest, SVM, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Neural Networks. Similarly, Figure 5 depicts the 100 rounds prediction
accuracy of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
entropy, and Decision Tree regressor. Overall, the Random
Forest model performs excellent in prediction and Naive
Bayes performs very poorly during the 100 round iterations.
As per our experienced, the Neural Network takes huge time
in training and testing.
Figure 6, 7 and 8 depicts the best, average and worst
case accuracy in prediction of Random Forest, Support
Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree entropy, and Decision Tree regressor. The worst performer is Naive Bayes
algorithm in this dataset. The best, average and worst
case prediction accuracy of Naive Bayes are 92.98245614,
89.28654971, and 84.21052632 respectively. The highest
’Best Case’ is achieved by SVM and Neural Networks
which is 99.41520468 for both. The Random Forest model
consistently predicts with high accuracy on an average
95.5380117. It outperforms SVM and all other learning models as shown in Figure 6, 7 and 8. The Best Case of Random
Forest is slightly lower than SVM and Neural Network.
However, the SVM is the best in Best Case (99.41520468)
and Worst Case (92.39766082). The Neural Network shows
poor performance in Worst case (87.13450292) and average
case (93.32748538). The accuracy of the learning models
fluctuates with the times due to random samples taken from
the input. Therefore, we perform 100 times experiments with
the same dataset to extract the mean value.
The randomness in Machine Learning algorithms makes
difficult to decide the prediction accuracy. As per our
experience, the prediction accuracy always varies. Figure
4, and 5 depicts the randomness of the accuracy during
100 rounds training and testing. We have observed that the

results never remain same as previous result. Therefore, it
is very easy to claim the maximum accuracy with highest
possible results which cannot be validated or believed easily.

Is it wiser way to believe others research results? Or can a
researcher manipulate their results? These questions arrives
in randomness.

4.1 Accuracy measurement with various partition

Fig. 6: Average accuracy calculation of some machine learning algorithms on UCI Breast Cancer dataset. Considering
every possible split as 50-50, 60-40, 70-30, and 80-20.
Figure 6 shows the average accuracy calculation on
various machine learning algorithms. The dataset is split

into 50-50, 60-40, 70-30, and 80-20. In this case, we have
observed that 80-20 accuracy is better than other splitting.
Moreover, most of the article reports 70-30 and it is assumed
as standard practice. The SVM and Random Forest algorithm
excel all the split. Logistic regression outperform Nearest
Neighbor and Neural Network. However, the Logistic regression exhibits its poor performance in 60-40 split.
Figure 7 shows the maximum accuracy in 50-50, 6040, 70-30, and 80-20 split. The SVM achieves highest
accuracy in 80-20 dataset split. The Random Forest performs
better than all other algorithms in 50-50, 60-40, and 70-30
dataset split. However, the maximum does not count in life
threatening diseases.
Figure 6, 7, and 8 shows the mean accuracy, maximum
accuracy, and minimum accuracy respectively. The figures
show the accuracy of Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, Neural
Network, Decision Tree Entropy, Decision Tree Regressor,

Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVM. SVM performs the best in 50-50 and 80-20 split and Random Forest
perform the best in 60-40 and 70-30 split in minimum
accuracy. Nearest Neighbor performs well in 50-50 split
and Logistic regression perform well in 50-50 split in the
case of minimum accuracy. Surprisingly, the Neural Network
performs worst in Minimum accuracy in all split. Therefore,
we cannot rely on Neural Network algorithm, albeit the
algorithm gives the best result in some cases. However,
in this evaluation, the Random forest outperforms all other
algorithms.

4.2 Doubling the dataset

Fig. 11: Number of hundred percent accuracy counts in
machine learning algorithms during 100 runs

A 100% accuracy is unbelievable! It’s surprising! However, we have achieved. The Random Forest shows the
maximum accuracy of 100% in the Wisconsin Breast Cancer
dataset by doubling the input size. The accuracy of Random
Forest, Neural Network, and Decision Tree reached to 100%
in the best case by doubling the input dataset. The Nearest
Neighbor, Naive Bayes, and SVM could not reach to hundred
percent. However, the accuracy also increased in this input.
The total hundred percent accuracy count is maximum in
80-20 partition and the Random Forest exhibit the highest
of 21s hundred count in 100 runs. Moreover, the average
accuracy of all algorithms has raised. Random Forest shows
the best performance in the average case. And, the decision
tree also performs satisfactory in the average case.
The Random Forest excels in prediction in minimum accuracy, however, the all other algorithms also performs well
except Neural Network. The result shows that the accuracy
of a machine learning algorithm can easily be manipulated.
The Random Forest model is more vulnerable to this kind
of malicious result intentionally or unintentionally. However,

significant factor in life threatening diseases. The minimum
accuracy plays utmost important in benchmarking process
and real life scenario in the case of life threatening diseases,
for instance, Cancer. The paper also discusses on how to
achieve 100% accuracy, using machine learning algorithm.
Also, we demonstrated the unethical way of reporting accuracy of machine learning algorithm which can easily mislead
the algorithm intentionally or unintentionally. Enhancing the
maximum accuracy does not impact in Cancer Computing.
On the contrary, most of the researchers interested in the
enhancement of maximum accuracy which does not serve
the purpose of cancer computing.

the SVM is not affected more with the doubling the size, but
we also observed the low rises in accuracy.

Table 2 exposes one of the reasons for increasing accuracy. An increment of input increases the accuracy. The
machine learning algorithm depends on the input size. An
input of 2 and one misclassification causes 50% degradation
of accuracy. While same number of misclassification in 100
inputs causes 99% accuracy. The accuracy also increased
in doubling the data. Moreover, the machine learning algorithms selects a random sample from the input which
is more accurate to predict. Because, the data sample is
duplicated and one of the samples is picked and matched
with a duplicate sample data. Thus, accuracy increases to
100%. However, this practice is unethical. On the contrary,
a large amount of data can be generated using genetic
algorithm. A malignant and a benign dataset can be used
to generate offspring randomly by crossover method. This
is not deployable in real life, however, we can evaluate
experimentally the performance of the machine learning
algorithm by the large set of dataset.
