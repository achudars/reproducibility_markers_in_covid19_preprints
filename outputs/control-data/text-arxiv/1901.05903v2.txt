Abstract. Face recognition is one of the most widely publicized feature in the
devices today and hence represents an important problem that should be studied
with the utmost priority. As per the recent trends, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches are highly successful in many tasks of Computer
Vision including face recognition. The loss function is used on the top of CNN
to judge the goodness of any network. In this paper, we present a performance
comparison of different loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Angular Softmax,
Additive-Margin Softmax, ArcFace and Marginal Loss for face recognition. The
experiments are conducted with two CNN architectures namely, ResNet and MobileNet. Two widely used face datasets namely, CASIA-Webface and MS-Celeb1M are used for the training and benchmark Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)
face dataset is used for the testing.

Introduction

Unconstrained face recognition is one of the most challenging problems of computer vision. With numerous use cases like criminal identification, attendance systems, face-unlock systems, etc., face recognition has become a part of our day to day
lives. The simplicity of using these recognition tools is one of the major reasons for
its widespread adoption in industrial and administrative use. Many scientists and researchers have been working on various techniques to obtain an accurate and robust
face recognition mechanism as its use will increase exponentially in coming years.
In 2012, the revolutionary work presented by Krizhevsky et al. [9] with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) was one of the major breakthroughs in the image
recognition area and won the ImageNet Large Scale Challenge. Various CNN based
approaches have been proposed for the face recognition task in the past few years. Most
of the techniques dealt with including all the complexities and non-linearities needed
for the problem and thus obtaining more generalized features and achieving state-ofthe-art accuracies over major face datasets like LFW [8], etc. Since 2012, many deep
learning based face recognition frameworks like DeepFace [20], DeepID [18], FaceNet
[16], etc. have come up, easily surpassing the performance obtained via hand-crafted
methods with a great margin.

The rise in the performance in image recognition was observed along with the line
of increasing depth of the CNN architectures such as GoogLeNet [19] and ResNet [6].
Whereas, it is found that after certain depth, the performance tends to saturate towards
mean accuracy, i.e., more depth has almost no effect over performance [6]. At the same
time, large scale application of face recognition would be prohibitive due to the need of
high computational resources for deep architectures. Thus, in recent years, researchers
are also working over the other aspects of the CNN model like loss functions, nonlinearities, optimizers, etc. One of the major works done in this field includes the development of suitable loss functions, specifically designed for face recognition. Early works
towards loss functions include Center Loss [23] and Triplet Loss [16] which focused
on reducing the distance between the current sample and positive sample and increase
the distance for the negative ones, thus closely relating to human recognition. Recent
loss functions like Soft-Margin Softmax Loss [10], Congenerous Cosine Loss [13],
Minimum Margin Loss [22], Range Loss [27], L2 -Softmax Loss [15], Large-Margin
Softmax Loss [11], and A-Softmax Loss [12] have shown promising performance over
lighter CNN models and some exceeding results over large CNN models.
Motivated by the recent rise in face recognition performance due to loss functions,
this paper provides an extensive performance comparison of recently proposed loss
functions for deep face recognition. Various experiments are conducted in this study to
judge the performance of different loss functions from different aspects like effect of
architecture such as deep and light weight and effect of training dataset. The results are
analyzed using the training accuracy, test accuracy and rate of convergence. This paper
is divided into following sections. Section 2 gives a comparative overview of the popular
loss functions. Section 3 describes the CNN architectures used. Section 4 discusses the
training and testing setup. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 concludes the paper.

Loss Functions Used

As discussed in the earlier section, loss functions play an important role in CNN
training. In this study, we discuss the widely used loss functions in face recognition. We
have considered five loss functions, namely, Cross-Entropy Loss [18], Angular-Softmax
Loss [12], Additive Margin Softmax Loss [21], ArcFace Loss [2], and Marginal Loss
[3]. Some loss functions like Angular-Softmax Loss and Additive Margin Softmax Loss
etc. are proposed specifically for the face recognition task.
Cross-Entropy Loss: The cross-entropy loss is one of the most widely used loss
functions in deep learning for many applications [4], [9]. It is also known as softmax
loss and has been proven quite effective in eliminating outliers in face recognition task
as well [14], [18]. The cross-entropy loss is given as,
LCE = −

j=1

where W is the weight matrix, b is the bias term, xi is the ith training sample, yi is the
class label for ith training sample, N is the number of samples, Wj and Wyi are the j th
and yith column of W , respectively. The loss function has been used in the initial works

done for face recognition tasks like the DeepID2 [18], which has formed the foundation
for current work in the domain.
Angular-Softmax Loss: Liu et al. in 2017 published one of the many modifications
to softmax function to introduce margin based learning. They proposed the AngularSoftmax (A-Softmax) loss that enables CNNs to learn angularly discriminative features
[12]. It is defined as,
LAS = −

where xi is the ith training sample, ψ(θyi ,i ) = (−1)k cos(mθyi ,i ) − 2k for θyi ,i ∈ [ kπ
m,
m
k ∈ [0, m−1] and m ≥ 1 is an integer that controls the size of angular margin. The performance of this function has been impressive, which has given a base for various margin
based loss functions including CosineFace [21] and ArcFace [2].
Additive-Margin Softmax Loss: Motivated from the improved performance of
SphereFace using Angular-Softmax Loss, Wang et al. have worked on an additive margin for softmax loss and given a general function for large margin property [21], described in following Equation,

ψ(θ) = cosθ − m.

(3)

Using this margin, the authors have proposed the following loss function,
LAM = −

N
es·(cosθyi −m)
1 X
log
Pc
N i=1
es·(cosθyi −m) + j=1,j6=yi es·cosθj

(4)

.
where a hyper-parameter s as suggested in [21] is used to scale up the cosine values.
ArcFace Loss: Based on the above loss functions, Deng et al. have proposed a new
margin cos(θ+m) [2], which they state to be more stringent for classification. The angular margin [2] represents the best geometrical interpretation as compared to SphereFace
and CosineFace. The ArcFace Loss function using angular margin is formulated as,
LAF = −

N
1 X
es·(cos(θyi +m))
,
log s· (cos(θ +m)) Pn
yi
N i=1
e
+ j=1,j6=yi es·cos θj

(5)

where s is the radius of the hypersphere, m is the additive angular margin penalty
between xi and Wyi , and cos(θ + m) is the margin, which makes the class-separations
more stringent. The ArcFace loss function has shown improved performance over the
LFW dataset. Its performance is also very promising over the large-scale MegaFace
dataset for face identification.
Marginal Loss: In 2017, Deng et al. proposed the Marginal Loss function [3] which
works simultaneously to maximize the inter-class distances as well as to minimize the
intra-class variations, both being desired features of a loss function. In order to do so,
the Margin Loss function focuses on the marginal samples. It is given as,

The term yij {±1} indicates whether the faces xi and xj are from the same class or not,
θ is the distance threshold to distinguish whether the faces are from the same person

Marginal Loss function is defined as the joint supervision with regular Cross-Entropy
(Softmax) Loss function and is given as,
LML = LCE + λLM

(7)

where LCE is the cross-entropy (Softmax) Loss (Equation 1). The hyper-parameter λ
is used for balancing the two losses. Usage of cross-entropy loss provides separable
features and prevents the marginal loss from degrading to zeros [3].

Network Architectures

The CNNs have shown great performance for face recognition. We use the ResNet
and MobileNet models to test over high performance and mobile platform scenarios.
ResNet Model:
He et al. proposed a novel ResNet architecture which won the ImageNet challenge in 2015. The ResNet architecture is made with the building blocks
of residual units. The Figure 1(a) demonstrate a residual unit. The ResNet unit learns
a mapping between inputs and outputs using residual connections [17]. This approach
eliminates the problem of vanishing gradient as the identity mapping provides a clear
pathway for the gradients to pass through the network. ResNet has proven to be a quite
effective for a wide variety of vision tasks like image recognition, object detection and
image segmentation. Hence, it makes the architecture one of the pioneer ensembles for
face recognition tasks as visible from its many variants including ResNeXt [24] and
SphereFace [12]. In this paper, ResNet50 is used by keeping in mind the primary objective of evaluating efficiency of loss functions on standard architectures.
MobileNet:
In 2017, Howard et al. presented a class of efficient architectures named
MobileNets. These CNN models were designed with the primary aim of achieving efficient performance for mobile vision applications. This model uses the depth-wise separable convolutions as proposed by Chollet for the Xception architecture [1]. The building blocks for MobileNet are portrayed in Fig 1(b). The MobileNet architecture facilitates to build a light weight deep learning model. This model has shown the promising

results over various vision based applications like object detection, face attributes and
large scale Geo-localization with an efficient trade-off between latency and accuracy.

Experimental Setup

CNN based Face Recognition: The CNN based face recognition approach is illustrated in Fig. 2. In each epoch, the learned weights obtained after training on all batches
of training images are used to obtain the classification scores and accuracy over the
training dataset. After training of each epoch, the trained weights at the moment are
transferred to compute the accuracy over the test dataset.
Training Datasets: The CASIA-WebFace [25] is the most widely used publicly available face dataset. It contains 4,94,414 face images belonging to 10,575 different individuals. The original MS-Celeb-1M dataset [5] consists of 100k face identities with
each identity having approximately 100 images resulting in about 10M images, which
are scraped from public search engines. We have used a refined high-quality subset
based on the clean list released by ArcFace [2] authors. Finally, we obtained the MSCeleb-1M dataset which contains 350k images with 8750 unique identities.
Testing Dataset: Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) images [8] are used as the testing
dataset in this study. The LFW dataset contains 13,233 images of faces collected from
the web. This dataset consists of the 5749 identities with 1680 people with two or more
images. By following the standard LFW evaluation protocol [7], we have reported the
verification accuracies on 6000 face pairs.
Input Data and Network Settings: We have used MTCNN [26] to detect facial landmarks to align the face images, similar to [12], [2], [3]. Each pixel in these images is
normalized by subtracting 127.5 and then being divided by 128. We have set the batch
size as 64 with the initial learning rate as 0.01. The learning rate is divided by 10 at the
8th , 12th and 16th epoch. The model is trained up to 20 epochs. The number of epochs
is less because the number of batches in an epoch is very high. The SGD optimizer with
momentum is used for the optimization. The momentum and weight decay are set at
0.9 and 5e−4 , respectively.

Performance Evaluation and Observations

The loss functions as described in Section 2 are used with ResNet50 and MobileNetv1 CNN architectures to perform the training over MS-Celeb-1M and CASIAWebface datasets and testing over LFW dataset. Here, we give a comparison of results
based on test accuracies, rate of convergence and training and testing results.

Test Accuracy Comparison

The different models have shown diverse performance when evaluated on the LFW
dataset for face recognition. As evident from Figure 3, the two CNN architectures,
ResNet50 and MobileNetv1 when trained on two face datasets, namely MS-Celeb-1M
and CASIA-Webface show a varied performance of face recognition tasks. The best
performing model obtained during the experiments is the ResNet50 model when trained

on CASIA-Webface dataset using the ArcFace loss with an accuracy of 99.35% on
LFW dataset. The observed performance of ArcFace also resonates with its results when
obtained with MobileNet architecture. It can be observed that the highest accuracies of
99.01% and 98.43% using MobileNetv1 are obtained using the ArcFace loss function
when trained over CASIA-Webface and MS-Celeb-1M datasets, respectively. However,
when ArcFace loss is used with ResNet50 and trained with the MS-Celeb-1M dataset,
its accuracy of 99.15% over LFW is slightly edged out by the Additive-Margin Softmax
where we observed an accuracy of 99.30%, the third best performing model obtained
in our experiments.
In view of loss functions, the overall performance observed is in the following decreasing order: ArcFace, Additive Margin Softmax, Angular Softmax, Marginal Loss
and Cross Entropy (Softmax). The Angular Softmax and Marginal loss almost have a
similar performance with the first performing better with ResNet50 model while the

8

latter showing better results with MobileNet model. The performance of Cross-Entropy
Loss is not as good when compared to other losses. It can be justified as other four
losses are proposed as the improvements over the Cross-Entropy Loss. The Additive
Margin softmax Loss performed close to ArcFace Loss when observed with ResNet50
architecture, but lagged behind when MobileNet architecture is used.
The performance difference observed for ArcFace Loss in ResNet and MobileNet
architectures can be attributed to the base architecture itself. The ResNet 50 architecture used in our analysis is deep with 50 convolutional layers and residual modules.
Whereas, the MobileNet architecture, has less number of convolutional layers and uses
Depth Wise Separable Convolutions which tend to increase computation efficiency (for
mobile devices) with certain tradeoffs. Moreover, the performance of other losses such
as Angular Softmax, AM Softmax and Marginal loss is slightly lower than ArcFace due
to the different ways of incorporating the margins.
Now coming to training datasets, we observed a distinct pattern when we evaluated
models on LFW. The results that we obtained on both CNN architectures when trained
on CASIA-Webface were comparatively better as compared to the same architectures
trained on MS-Celeb-1M. One possibility for this observation stems out from the fact
that MS-Celeb-1M contains more variations and even after extensive cleaning of the
dataset as described in Section 4, there might be some existing noise as compared to
CASIA-Webface.
5.2

Convergence Rate Comparison

In this paper, we define convergence rate in terms of the minimum number of epochs
taken for a particular model to achieve it’s highest test accuracy over LFW dataset. As
discussed in the last section, a similar pattern of results is observed when we compare
the convergence rate of loss functions for a same set of CNN architectures and training
datasets. A comparison of convergence rate can be seen in Figure 4. Again, the ArcFace loss has showed the fastest rate of convergence in all the models considered in
this experiment. The ResNet architecture when trained on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset
using ArcFace converged at 13th epoch, the lowest epoch value seen in our tests. The
same result is also observed with ArcFace when using MobileNet with CASIA-Webface
training dataset.
Considering the two CNN architectures, ResNet50 and MobileNet, we observed a
distinct pattern in terms of convergence rate when both the architectures are trained
on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset. The ResNet model converged faster when compared to
the MobileNet model with most of the loss functions, with the exception of Additive
Margin Softmax Loss which converged on the 15th epoch for both the architectures.
On the other hand, when the performance of architectures is observed over CASIAWebface training dataset, a similar rate of convergence was observed for almost all the
models based on ResNet and MobileNet using test dataset.
5.3

Training and Testing Results Comparison

The training and testing accuracies obtained during the experiments are summarized in Table 1. The training accuracies reported in the table are obtained after training

the model till the 20th epoch, that means after complete training of the model with
the specified training dataset. Comparing the training accuracies, the highest accuracy
of 95.12% is obtained with the Additive Margin Softmax Loss when used with MobileNetv1 architecture and trained on CASIA-Webface dataset.
We have also computed the mean and standard deviation of testing accuracies obtained between the 10th and the 20th epoch to obtain the more generic performance of
the loss functions discussed in Section 2. These results also help us to observe the deviations of results between epochs as well as the convergence of the loss functions towards
a saturation point. The highest mean accuracy of 99.01% was observed for the ArcFace
Loss when trained over CASIA-Webface dataset using the ResNet50 architecture with
the standard deviation of 0.305. It is also observed that the above standard deviation is
the lowest obtained over all the models considered in the experiments. Such a low standard deviation reaffirms the better performance of the ArcFace Loss over the epochs
when compared to other loss functions discussed before in this study. The above observation resonates with other results like test accuracies and rate of convergence that we
noticed in the previous sections, hence solidifying our computation of results obtained
during the experiments.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a performance evaluation of recent loss functions
with Convolutional Neural Networks for face recognition tasks. Recent loss functions
like Angular-Softmax, Additive-Margin Softmax, ArcFace and Marginal Loss are compared and evaluated along with Cross-Entropy Loss. The ResNet50 and MobileNetv1
are used in our performance studies. Publicly available datasets like CASIA-Webface
and MS-Celeb-1M are used for training the models. The performance is evaluated on
the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The results are computed in terms of the
training accuracy, test accuracy, and convergence rate. The ArcFace loss emerged as the
best performing loss function with highest accuracy of 99.35% over CASIA-Webface
dataset. We evaluated the state-of-the-art losses for deep face recognition, which can
help to the research community to choose among the different loss functions.
