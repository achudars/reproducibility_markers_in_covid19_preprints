ABSTRACT
We test the use of long-wavelength dust continuum emission as a molecular gas tracer at high redshift, via a
unique sample of 12, z ∼ 2 galaxies with observations of both the dust continuum and CO(1-0) line emission
(obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, respectively). Our
work is motivated by recent, high redshift studies that measure molecular gas masses (Mmol ) via a calibration
of the rest-frame 850µm luminosity (L850µm,rest ) against the CO(1-0)-derived Mmol of star-forming galaxies.
We hereby test whether this method is valid for the types of high-redshift, star-forming galaxies to which it has
been applied. We recover a clear correlation between the rest-frame 850µm luminosity, inferred from the singleband, long-wavelength flux, and the CO(1-0) line luminosity, consistent with the samples used to perform the
850µm calibration. The molecular gas masses, derived from L850µm,rest , agree to within a factor of two with
those derived from CO(1-0). We show that this factor of two uncertainty can arise from the values of the dust
emissivity index and temperature that need to be assumed in order to extrapolate from the observed frequency
to the rest-frame at 850µm. The extrapolation to 850µm therefore has a smaller effect on the accuracy of Mmol
derived via single-band dust-continuum observations than the assumed CO(1-0)-to-Mmol conversion factor.
We therefore conclude that single-band observations of long-wavelength dust emission can be used to reliably
constrain the molecular gas masses of massive, star-forming galaxies at z & 2.

1. INTRODUCTION

Most star formation is observed to occur within the molecular phase of the interstellar medium (ISM), with observations demonstrating a strong correlation between the surface
density of the star formation rate (SFR) and that of the molecular gas (e.g. Wong & Blitz 2002; Bigiel et al. 2008, 2011;
Leroy et al. 2008). On a cosmic scale, the SFR density
peaked at z ∼ 2, and has since declined exponentially (see
Madau & Dickinson 2014, and references therein). This decline can largely be attributed to the 10−100 fold decrease in
SFR of the dominant population of star-forming galaxies, i.e.
those occupying the Main Sequence (MS, linear relation between the SFR, and stellar mass), from z ∼ 2 to the present
day (e.g. Daddi et al. 2007; Elbaz et al. 2011; Speagle et al.

2014; Whitaker et al. 2014). Understanding the physical processes driving the decline in SFR requires the accurate measurement of the molecular gas content out to high redshift.
But, measuring the molecular gas masses (Mmol ) of galaxies
at z > 1 remains a challenge.
The emission from H2 , the most abundant component of
the cold, dense phase of the ISM relevant to star formation,
cannot be observed directly. Thus, Mmol is usually measured
via the emission from other, less abundant components of the
ISM. Studies of local galaxies typically rely on the ground
transition of CO (J = 1 − 0) to measure Mmol , converting the CO(1-0) line luminosity to a molecular gas mass via
the application of an empirically-derived, CO-to-Mmol conversion factor (see Bolatto et al. 2013, for a review). How-

ever, the majority of high-redshift (z > 1) observations are
of higher-J CO transitions, which are brighter and more readily detected by millimeter interferometers operating in the 13mm atmospheric windows, i.e. the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the NOrthern Extended Millimeter
Array (NOEMA). The use of higher-J, CO lines requires an
additional correction for the (a priori unknown) excitation of
the gas, increasing the uncertainty of the derived gas masses
by at least a factor of two (see e.g. the variation in the CO(32)-to-CO(1-0) line ratio in Iono et al. 2009; Mao et al. 2010;
Harris et al. 2010; Ivison et al. 2011; Riechers et al. 2011;
Papadopoulos et al. 2012; Sharon et al. 2016 and other issues
discussed in Carilli & Walter 2013).
To combat the difficulty of relying on faint and/or high
excitation lines at high redshift, Scoville (2012), suggested
the use of the long-wavelength RayleighJeans (RJ) tail of
dust emission. Methods of measuring Mmol from longwavelength dust continuum emission were subsequently developed via empirical calibrations of rest-frame infrared (IR)
luminosities against CO-derived molecular gas masses (Eales
et al. 2012; Bourne et al. 2013; Groves et al. 2015; Scoville et al. 2014, 2016, 2017; Hughes et al. 2017). The restframe 850µm luminosity (L850µm,rest ) was found to exhibit
a particularly tight correlation with the CO(1-0) line luminosity (e.g. Scoville et al. 2016; Hughes et al. 2017). For
brevity, we henceforth refer to the method calibrated against
L850µm,rest as the RJ method.
Applying the RJ method requires the conversion of the observed emission to L850µm,rest , either by fitting the IR portion of the spectral energy distribution (SED) (e.g. Hughes
et al. 2017), or, extrapolating from a single-band measurement in the RJ tail, assuming the dust opacity coefficient
and mean temperature of dust contributing to the RJ tail (e.g.
Scoville et al. 2016). The single-band RJ method is particularly convenient at high redshift, where the required observations take of the order of a minute per source with ALMA
(Scoville et al. 2016), in contrast to the multiple hours required to observe CO emission (e.g. Tacconi et al. 2013).
The variety of methods used to measure Mmol complicate
efforts to link the molecular gas contents and SFRs of galaxies. Like the SFR, the molecular gas mass fractions of starforming galaxies appear to have declined since z ∼ 2 (e.g.
Daddi et al. 2010b; Riechers et al. 2010; Genzel et al. 2010,
2015; Tacconi et al. 2010, 2018; Dessauges-Zavadsky et al.
2015; Decarli et al. 2016; Schinnerer et al. 2016; Scoville
et al. 2017; Darvish et al. 2018). But, there remains some
tension between the gas scaling relations derived in these
studies, especially regarding the contribution of the star formation efficiency to the declining SFRs of MS galaxies.
Most studies find a slight decline in the star formation efficiency of MS galaxies with redshift (Tacconi et al. 2010;
Genzel et al. 2010, 2015; Scoville et al. 2016, 2017; Tacconi

et al. 2018; Darvish et al. 2018), but the exact scaling varies.
Genzel et al. (2015) find that the increased SFRs of highredshift (high-z), MS galaxies can be mainly attributed to
higher gas mass fractions, whereas Scoville et al. (2016) and
Darvish et al. (2018) also find a significantly more efficient
mode of star formation in high-z galaxies (5× shorter gas
depletion times). A similar inconsistency exists regarding
the difference between MS and starburst galaxies. Whereas
Scoville et al. (2016) and Darvish et al. (2018) conclude that
the high SFRs of starburst galaxies relative to the MS are
driven by both the higher molecular gas masses and star formation efficiencies of the former, Daddi et al. (2010a) and
Genzel et al. (2010, 2015) mainly attribute the offset from
the MS to higher star formation efficiencies.
The extent to which the differences between molecular gas
scaling relations are affected by the assumptions used to infer
molecular gas masses, from CO vs dust continuum emission,
has not yet been quantified in detail. Recent studies have
begun to address the need for consistency between dust and
CO-based measurements. For example, Hughes et al. (2017)
compared the CO(1-0) line luminosities and L850µm,rest of
local star-forming galaxies, whereas Liang et al. (2018) and
Privon et al. (2018) compared the RJ-based Mmol with the
“true” Mmol of a set of simulated star-forming galaxies. Although these studies have investigated the use of L850µm,rest
as a gas mass tracer, they do not confirm whether the gas
masses, already determined for & 600 high-z galaxies (Scoville et al. 2016, 2017; Schinnerer et al. 2016; Miettinen et al.
2017; Darvish et al. 2018), are equivalent to what would be
derived using CO(1-0).
To compare the molecular gas masses, derived from the
single-band RJ continuum and CO(1-0), we have assembled
a unique sample of 16 unlensed, z ∼ 2, star-forming galaxies with CO(1-0) observations from the VLA, and, dust continuum measurements from the ALMA. This sample represents a significant increase in the number of CO(1-0) detections at high redshift with ∼ 50 sources at z > 1 having
been detected previously (e.g. supplementary table of Carilli & Walter 2013), out of which . 20 sources are unlensed
(e.g Emonts et al. 2013; Aravena et al. 2014; Bolatto et al.
2015; Huynh et al. 2017; Pavesi et al. 2018). The fact that
our sources are unlensed avoids potential complications involving differential lensing. Our sample consists of massive
(> 2 × 1010 M ) galaxies both on and above the MS. We
thereby focus on the galaxy population dominating the peak
of the cosmic SFR density.
This paper is structured as follows. We present our sample
and describe the observations and data reduction in Section
2. In Section 3 we explain how we derive the molecular gas
masses, SFRs and stellar masses. We present our results and
discussion in Section 4, comparing the CO(1-0) line luminosity and L850µm,rest , as well as the molecular gas masses

derived from these luminosities. Our work is summarised
in Section 5. Throughout this paper we assume a ΛCDM
cosmology with H0 = 70km s−1 Mpc−1 , ΩM = 0.3 and
ΩΛ = 0.7. All stellar masses and SFRs are based on a
Chabrier (2003) IMF. We use a CO-to-Mmol conversion factor of αCO = 6.5 M /(K km s−1 pc2 ) throughout this paper.

2. SAMPLE AND OBSERVATIONS

2.1. Sample Selection
Our sample is comprised of 16, massive, star-forming
galaxies at z ∼ 2, with long-wavelength (rest-frame
∼ 250µm) dust continuum measurements from ALMA
(ALMA, Wootten & Thompson 2009). Our sample was selected from the ALMA-detected, IR-bright sample of Scoville et al. (2017). The parent sample of Scoville et al. (2017)
was chosen using the Herschel-based catalogue of far-IR
sources in the COSMOS field (Lee et al. 2013, 2015). We
therefore have photometric measurements of at least two of
the five IR Herschel bands: the 100µm and 160µm bands
from PACS (Lutz et al. 2011) and the 250µm, 350µm, and

2.2. CO(1-0) Observations and Data Reduction
The VLA observations analysed here were taken during
February and March 2017. Of the 16 galaxies in our sample,
four were observed in the Q band (40 − 50GHz) and 12 in
the Ka band (26.5 − 40GHz). Each target was observed for
a total of four hours, including the time spent on bandpass,
phase and amplitude calibration sources.
The raw VLA data were processed to produce clean images using the Common Astronomy Software Application
(CASA)1 , version 4.7.2. To calibrate the data, we applied the
VLA calibration pipeline2 without Hanning smoothing. We
created the initial dirty images using CASA’s TCLEAN algorithm. These dirty images are used to visually identify the
presence of CO and ensure the source emission is found at
the anticipated position. We then create cleaned image cubes
for these sources via CASA’s TCLEAN, applying a natural
weighting scheme, a cleaning threshold of twice the rootmean-square (rms) noise level (2σ) and a circular mask with
a radius of 5”, centred at the position of the source. We optimise the spectral resolution to achieve higher signal-to-noise
ratios (S/N). For sources 8 and 16 it was necessary to use the
native resolution (∼ 16km s−1 ) to extract the spectra (see
Figure 11). We provide the smoothed, extracted spectra of
our full sample in Figure 10 (Appendix A).
We detect CO(1-0) emission in 10 of the 16 sources in our
sample. To classify a source as a CO detection we require
the peak flux of the spectrum, extracted at the source position, and the peak flux in the moment zero map to be detected at ≥ 3σ. For the CO-detected sources, we derive the
CO(1-0) flux, central frequency, and spectroscopic redshift
by fitting a single Gaussian to the CO(1-0) line emission via
Python’s scipy.optimize.curvefit algorithm. We
use a 1/σ 2 weighting scheme, where σ is the rms noise per
channel, and take the 1σ errors estimated by our fitting routine as the uncertainties of the measured values. We provide
the rms noise of the channel corresponding to the CO(1-0)
peak, the peak flux and total line flux in Table 2. The spectra
and emission-line fits are shown in Figure 11 (Appendix A),
with two examples shown in Figure 1. Although the spectra
of sources 3 and 8 are best fit by double Gaussian profiles
(based on the χ2 values) we provide the single Gaussian fits
in this paper. We do not consider the double Gaussian profiles to be physical given the relative strengths of the rms and
dip in flux. Our choice of line profile has no impact on our
results. The fluxes derived from the double Gaussian line

profiles are consistent, within uncertainties, with the single
Gaussian fits shown in Figure 11 of the Appendix.
The CO(1-0) line fluxes, and subsequent luminosities,
quoted in this paper are based on our single Gaussian line
profile fits. These values are consistent, within uncertainties,
with the integrated line fluxes extracted from the moment
zero maps, for which we tested two methods: (1) extracting the fluxes at the source position and (2) estimating the
line flux via the 2D Gaussian fits of CASA’s imfit. Our
moment zero maps are shown in the central panel of the
integrated maps in Figures 2 and 12 (Appendix). We provide three channel maps in order to: (1) show the lack of
continuum emission around CO(1-0), and, (2) highlight that
we have captured all CO(1-0) emission in the moment zero
maps (centre). The velocity widths of the moment zero (and
adjacent, integrated) maps, indicated by the yellow shaded
regions of Figures 1 and 11 (Appendix), were selected to
encompass the range of velocities at which the source emission was visible at ≥ 3σ in the cleaned data cubes. For most
sources, the velocity widths of the integrated, moment zero
maps are ∼ 1.2 the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
the CO(1-0) line. However, for sources 4 and 5, where the
spectra are not as well fit by Gaussian profiles, we create the
integrated channel maps based on greater velocity widths.
Our CO-derived redshifts are consistent with the redshifts
derived from rest-frame optical lines (flagged 3 or 4 in Table 1). As for the rest-frame optical emission lines, the typical uncertainties of our CO-derived redshifts are ∼ 0.0002.
In contrast, the uncertainty of the photometric redshifts are
∼ 0.2, on average, with values of ∼ 0.4 for some COSMOS
sources (Laigle et al. 2016). For example, source 1 has a
secure CO(1-0) detection at z = 2.607 but a predicted photometric redshift of 2.38.
We remove four sources from our sample, which have
unreliable redshifts (flagged in Table 1). Accurate spectroscopic redshifts are required in order to estimate upper limits on the CO(1-0) emission and fit the correct SED models
to infer stellar masses and SFRs (see Section 3.3). We relied on the COSMOS redshift catalogue to design our VLA
observations but reobserved sources 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11 and
12 with the Multi-Object Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE, on Keck I), after our VLA observations
were taken. Because we relied upon the catalogued redshifts
when taking our VLA data, the observed frequency intervals
for sources 2 and 9 are not optimised for the correct redshift
(see note below Table 1). Thus, the frequency range of the
observations for source 2 does not encompass the CO(1-0)
line, whereas for source 9, the expected position of CO(10) falls at the edge of the observed frequencies, where the
spectral noise is greatest. For source 6 we observed neither
CO(1-0) emission, nor any rest-frame optical emission lines.
Thus, we conclude that the photometric redshift of z = 2.68,

on which we based both the VLA and MOSFIRE observations, is not reliable. For source 14, we observe no CO(1-0)
emission and the rest-frame optical spectra exhibit only low
S/N peaks. Thus, we exclude sources 2, 6, 9 and 14 (starred
in Table 1) from further analysis.
For the two sources without CO(1-0) detections but with
reliable spectroscopic redshifts (sources 12 and 15) we estimate upper limits on the CO(1-0) emission based on the
moment zero maps, centred on the expected frequency of
the CO(1-0) line. We create each map using TCLEAN, with
a channel width of 500 km s−1 (consistent with the broader
lines of our CO-detected sample). We measure the rms value
in these single channel maps and use the 3σ value as our upper limit, consistent with our detection criteria. It is likely
that source 15 is not detected because it is just below the detection limit, i.e. the data here were too noisy to detect the
predicted signal. However, the same is not true for source
12, for which we would expect to detect CO based on the
predicted CO luminosity and noise limit. We can only speculate that one of the assumptions applied in the RJ method
does not apply to this source, e.g. that the dust-to-gas ratio is
greater than expected (see Section 3.2.1 for the assumptions).
2.3. Dust Continuum Data
We carefully measure the dust continuum flux of each
source, examining the images in the left panels of Figures
2 and 12. We note that the FWHM of the synthesized ALMA
beam is at least 6× smaller than that of the VLA beam (Figures 2 and 12). Thus, unlike for the CO(1-0) data, some of
our sources (particularly source 16) show resolved structure
in the dust continuum emission. We therefore use CASA’s
imfit to fit elliptical Gaussians to the source emission, focussing on the region of interest within 5” of the source. We
fit two Gaussians to the emission of source 16 but fit all other

sources with a single Gaussian element. We use the flux error
returned by imfit as the uncertainty on our derived fluxes.
The S/N of the continuum fluxes varies from 4 (Source 16) to
29 (Source 1). Our derived fluxes are mostly consistent with
those predicted by the automated procedure of Scoville et al.
(2017), except for source 5, for which our measured flux is
20% lower. We provide our measured fluxes in Table 2.
3. DERIVED QUANTITIES

3.1. CO(1-0)-based Molecular Gas Masses
We use our measured CO(1-0) fluxes and upper limits to derive the CO(1-0) line luminosities,
L0CO(1−0) (K km s−1 pc2 ). For sources with a CO(1-0)
detection we use the CO-derived spectroscopic redshift. For
upper limits, we rely on the spectroscopic redshifts from
the COSMOS catalogue. We calculate the CO(1-0) line
luminosities, via Equation (3) of Solomon et al. (1992),
−2 2
L0CO = 3.25 × 107 SCO ∆v νobs
DL (1 + z)−3 ,

(1)

where the CO(1-0) line flux, SCO ∆v, is in Jy km s−1 , the
observed frequency νobs is in GHz, and the luminosity distance, DL , is in Mpc.
We derive the total molecular gas mass, based on the CO(10) line luminosities, via,
Mmol = αCO L0CO(1−0) ,

(2)

with αCO = 6.5 M /(K km s−1 pc2 ). The chosen value
of αCO is based on a standard Galactic conversion factor of
XCO = 3 × 1020 cm2 (K km s−1 )−1 and includes a factor of
1.36 to account for the associated mass of heavy elements
(mostly He at 8% by number). We provide the values of
L0CO(1−0) and the CO(1-0)-based Mmol in Table 3.

Figure 3. Examples of rest-frame SEDs. The inset focuses on the portion of the rest-frame spectrum around 850µm, comparing the singleband (blue) and SED-derived (red) L850µm,rest , where the single-band derived value is calculated from Equation (5). Note that the best-fit SED
and value of L850µm,rest shown are based on the standard MAGPHYS assumptions of β = 1.5 and 2.0 for the warm and cold components,
respectively, with the temperature of the cold dust component as a free parameter. The black filled circles represent the photometry used to fit
the SEDs whereas the black triangles show the radio fluxes, which were not used to fit the SEDs.

The CO- and L850µm,rest -based Mmol presented in this paper are calculated using the same CO-to-Mmol conversion
factor, αCO = 6.5 M /(K km s−1 pc2 ). We select this value
solely in order to ensure consistency between the molecular gas masses we derive from CO(1-0) and L850µm,rest ,
because the latter was calibrated against CO(1-0)-derived
Mmol using this conversion factor (Scoville et al. 2016).
Our adopted value is a factor of ∼ 1.5 higher than the
4.36 M /(K km s−1 pc2 ) typically adopted by other studies, based on the recommendation of Bolatto et al. (2013)
(e.g. Tacconi et al. 2013; Genzel et al. 2015; Tacconi et al.
2018). Whereas the typically-adopted Milky Way value
(corresponding to XCO = 2 × 1020 cm2 (K km s−1 )−1 ) is
based on the compilation of results from gamma-ray observations, extinction measurements, dust emission and CO isotopologues, the value we have adopted here is derived from
the correlation of the CO line luminosities and virial masses
for resolved Galactic giant molecular clouds (Solomon et al.
1987; Scoville et al. 1987).
3.2. RJ-based Molecular Gas Masses
We derive the molecular gas masses from the inferred
L850µm,rest , the reference luminosity against which the RJ
method is calibrated. We infer L850µm,rest via two methods:
single−band
),
(1) from the single, ALMA band 7 flux only (L850µm,rest
SED
and, (2) from the best-fit model SEDs (L850µm,rest ). We
compare the values of L850µm,rest derived via these two
methods in Section 4.1.
3.2.1. Single-band Derived L850µm,rest
The first method we use to derive L850µm,rest follows the
prescription described in detail in Appendix A.1 of Scoville
et al. (2016, 2017). We outline their approach again here,
for clarity. Scoville et al. (2016, 2017) assume that the longwavelength dust continuum emission can be described by a

single modified blackbody, with a flux density given by:
Sν =

Mmol κ(νrest )Bνrest (Tdust )(1 + z)
,
d2L

(3)

where κ(νrest ) is the absorption coefficient of dust per unit
total mass of molecular gas, Bνrest is the Planck function and
dL the luminosity distance. The mean, mass-weighted dust
temperature, used to describe the modified blackbody emission, is assumed to be 25 K (discussed in Appendix A.2 of
Scoville et al. 2016). This choice is further justified by the
recent work of Liang et al. (2019). In the long-wavelength
regime, the flux is proportional to ν 2 and Equation (3) can
be rewritten by including a correction for the departure in
the rest frame of the Planck function from RJ approximation, Bνrest /RJνrest = ΓRJ (νobs , z). To relate the specific
luminosity in the rest frame of the galaxy to L850µm,rest , the
long-wavelength dust opacity, κ, is described by a power law,
κ(νobs,rest ) = κ(ν850µm )(λ/850µm)−β

(4)

with a dust emissivity index of β = 1.8 (see Appendix A.3 of
Scoville et al. 2016, for details). Note that because the dust
opacity is defined relative to the molecular gas mass, there is
an implicit assumption here of a constant gas-to-dust ratio.
Combining the above assumptions, the reference luminosity
can be calulated from the measured, RJ flux via,

∗ Derived from the dust continuum flux at 343.5 GHz using Equation (5).

3.2.2. SED-derived L850µm,rest
For our second method, we apply the updated version of
the SED-fitting algorithm MAGPHYS high-z, which builds a
likelihood distribution for L850µm,rest by marginalising over
a library of models with varying dust emission parameters,
such as dust temperatures (see also da Cunha et al. 2013).
MAGPHYS models the dust emission, from the rest-frame
mid-infrared to millimeter wavelengths, as the sum of four
dust components: (i) a component of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); (ii) a mid-infrared continuum that characterizes the emission from hot grains at temperatures in the
range 130-250 K; (iii) a warm dust component in thermal
equilibrium with temperatures in the range 30-80K; and (iv)
and a component of cold grains in thermal equilibrium with
adjustable temperature in the range 20-40 K. The emission
from the warm and cold dust components are described by
modified blackbodies.
We choose not to analyse the SED-derived dust masses
or temperatures due to degeneracies between these parameters. Our data do not sample far enough along the RJ tail to
break the degeneracy between Tdust and β (see e.g. da Cunha
et al. 2015). Moreover, the dust temperature relevant to the
RJ emission tail is the mass-weighted dust temperature (discussed in Appendix A.2. of Scoville et al. 2016). The total
dust mass inferred by MAGPHYS is a sum of the masses of
the modeled components, which are free parameters, and is
therefore degenerate with the temperatures of the dust components.
To assess what impact variations in β and Tdust have on
the derived L850µm,rest we apply MAGPHYS with four sets of
assumptions:

1. with β = 1.5 and 2.0 for the warm and cold components, respectively, and with the cold dust temperature
as a free parameter (standard version),
2. with β = 1.8 for the warm and cold components and
with the cold dust temperature as a free parameter,
3. with β = 1.5 and 2.0 for the warm and cold components, respectively, but with the temperature of the cold
component fixed to 25K, and,
4. with β = 1.8 for the warm and cold components and
the temperature of the cold component fixed to 25K.
We fit the rest-frame SEDs and build likelihood distributions for LSED
850µm,rest for each of these four cases. The restframe SEDs and best fit, based on the standard version of
MAGPHYS, are shown in Figures 3 and 13 (Appendix), with
the single-band and SED-derived values of L850µm,rest compared in the zoom-in panels.
3.2.3. Converting L850µm,rest to Mmol
We convert both the single-band and SED-derived values
of L850µm,rest to molecular gas masses by applying the conversion factor,

low-redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and

(Scoville et al. 2016). Thus, the single-band RJ method is

3.3. Stellar Masses and SFRs
We self-consistently derive the stellar masses, SFRs and
reference luminosities, LSED
850µm,rest , upon which the RJ
method is based (see Section 3.2) by fitting the SEDs of
our sources. The stellar masses and SFRs of our sample
have been previously derived by fitting the optical-to-infrared
SEDs via various techniques (see Lee et al. 2013, 2015;
Scoville et al. 2017, for details). The stellar masses, determined with the SED-fitting algorithm LePhare (Arnouts
et al. 1999; Ilbert et al. 2006), are provided as part of the
COSMOS catalogue (Laigle et al. 2016). However, for this
small sample we revisit the stellar mass and SFR fits, using the SED-fitting algorithm MAGPHYS, in order to: (1)
self-consistently fit the stellar masses, SFRs and LSED
850µm,rest ;
(2) explore the effect of the assumptions used to derive
LSED
850µm,rest ; (3) use the CO(1-0)-based redshifts (where these
are the most reliable redshifts), and; (4) validate the robustness of the SED-derived properties. We describe our application of MAGPHYS in the following subsection. Sources with
uncertain redshift measurements (starred in Table 1) have
been excluded from this analysis. The derived stellar masses
and SFRs are provided in Table 3.
The stellar masses and SFRs presented here are consistent
with the previously-derived values. The stellar masses derived via MAGPHYS and LePhare are consistent within a
factor of two (with no systematic offset) for all but source 15,
for which the MAGPHYS derived M∗ is a factor of five greater
(we trust our SED fit in Figure 13). Similarly, our MAGPHYSderived SFRs are consistent to within a factor of two with the
values used in Lee et al. (2015) and Scoville et al. (2017),
with no systematic offsets. Thus the conclusions we draw
with respect to the global properties of our sample are not affected by the choice of SED-fitting algorithm. However, the
scatter in values derived via different SED-fitting algorithms
indicates an uncertainty of at least a factor of two in both the
stellar masses and SFRs.

Applying the single-band method of Equation (5), with the
constant hα850µm i we find a range of Mmol of 1.7 − 7.1 ×
1011 M with a mean uncertainty of 0.9 × 1011 M . The
uncertainties of these Mmol values are derived from the uncertainty of both the measured dust continuum fluxes and
hα850µm i. Applying the standard version of MAGPHYS to
derive L850µm,rest , with the constant hα850µm i, we find a
range of Mmol of 1.1 − 5.3 × 1011 M with a mean uncertainty of 0.8 × 1011 M . The uncertainty of the MAGPHYSderived Mmol is based on the 16th and 84th percentiles of the
likelihood distribution of L850µm,rest and the uncertainty of
hα850µm i.

3.3.1. Application of MAGPHYS
We derive the stellar masses, SFRs and LSED
850µm,rest of
our sample via an updated version of the SED-fitting algorithm, MAGPHYS, that builds a likelihood distribution for
LSED
850µm,rest , applying the version optimised for high-z galaxies (da Cunha et al. 2015). We fit the available COSMOS photometry, from the GALEX far-ultraviolet to Herschel PACS 500 µm filters (taken from the 2016 catalogue of
Laigle et al. 2016), in addition to the ALMA Band 7 (343.5
GHz) dust continuum measurements (described in Section
2.3). For source 16, no Herschel data is available in the
Laigle et al. (2016) catalogue. Instead, we use the Herschel
data described in Lee et al. (2013)3 . The details of the SEDfitting framework, stellar model libraries and treatment of
dust are described in da Cunha et al. (2008, 2015). Two example SED fits are shown in Figure 3, the rest are shown
in Figure 13 in the Appendix. We choose not to apply the
1.4 and 3 GHz continuum flux measurements, available for
the majority of the sample (see overplotted black triangles in
both figures) because the radio/FIR correlation (assumed in
MAGPHYS da Cunha et al. 2015) is uncertain at these redshifts and may bias the results.

We use the median stellar masses and SFRs inferred via
MAGPHYS, and quote errors as the 16th and 84th percentile
ranges of the posterior likelihood distributions. These values are based on the spectroscopic redshifts, derived from
either CO(1-0), or, infrared emission lines (see Table 1 for
redshifts). The SFRs inferred by MAGPHYS represent the average of the star formation history (SFH) over the last 100
Myr (da Cunha et al. 2015). The SFH library of MAGPHYS
includes a wide range of continuous SFHs as well as accounting for stochasticity on the SFHs by superimposing star
formation bursts of random duration and amplitude. Thus,
MAGPHYS models the SFHs of starburst-like and more quiescently star-forming galaxies (see da Cunha et al. 2015, for
details). We use the SFH-based SFRs, rather than SFRs derived empirically from the IR luminosities here. However,
we note that the SFRs derived empirically from the total IR
luminosities are consistent to within a factor of 1.5 for the entire sample, with the IR-inferred SFRs a factor of 1.2 higher
on average.
To investigate the relationship between the derived gas
masses, we derive the offset from the MS, defined as the specific SFR (sSFR) of the source relative to the sSFR expected
for a MS galaxy of the given stellar mass and given epoch
(sSFRMS ). We define the MS using the best fit from Speagle
et al. (2014):
− (6.51 − 0.11t(z)) ,

(2) β = 1.8;

(7)

where t(z) is the age of the Universe at redshift, z, in Gyr.
We show the position of our sample in the MS plane in
Figure 4. The points are colour-coded by the MS offset,
sSFR/sSFRMS , based on the Speagle et al. (2014) definition, where the SFRs are derived from the SED. Our sample encompasses both MS and above-MS galaxies, spanning
1 < sSFR/sSFRMS < 7.
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1. Comparison of single-band and SED-derived
L850µm,rest
To assess the extent to which the assumed values of β
and Tdust affect the derived L850µm,rest , and thereby also
Mmol , we compare the single-band and SED-derived values
of L850µm,rest via the ratio between the two in Figure 5. Our
results are based on the mean value, hα850µm i = 6.7 ± 1.7 ×
1019 erg s−1 Hz−1 M−1 derived for the Scoville et al. (2016)
calibration sample. Scoville et al. (2016) also provide a fit for
the conversion factor that varies with L850µm,rest , based on
the best-fit relation between L850µm,rest and L0CO(1−0) (solid
line in Figure 6). However, the molecular gas masses derived from the mean and best-fit α850µm are consistent for

our sample. The comparison between the single-band and
SED-derived values of L850µm,rest is of particular relevance
given that there now exist a range of approaches to estimating
L850µm,rest . For example, Harrington et al. (2018) fit their
Herschel SPIRE 250 − 500µm and AzTEC 1.1 mm photometry with a modified blackbody (based on Equation 14 of Yun
& Carilli 2002) whereas Hughes et al. (2017) extrapolate the
value of L850µm,rest from the best-fit SEDs, modeled with
MAGPHYS.
We find that most values of L850µm,rest inferred via the
SED fit of MAGPHYS are consistent, within errors, with the
single-band derived values, once the dust emissivity and temperature of the cold dust are fixed to match the assumptions of the single-band RJ method (see Figures 5 and 6).
The standard version of MAGPHYS, which allows for variable dust temperatures for the hot and cold components, predicts values of L850µm,rest that are systematically lower than
those inferred via Equation (5), i.e. centred at 78% of the

single-band values (pink line and filled histogram). Fixing
the dust emissivities of both the warm and cold components
to β = 1.8, but allowing the dust temperatures to vary, leads
to slightly stronger agreement, with a median L850µm,rest ratio of 83% (red line and outlined histogram). Fixing only the
temperature of the cold dust component of MAGPHYS leads
to stronger agreement with the single-band method (median
of 94% that of the single-band method) than when solely fixing the dust emissivities to match (see light blue line and
filled histogram). Attempting to replicate the assumptions
made in the single-band RJ method (by fixing the temperature of the cold dust component to Tcold dust = 25K, and
assuming β = 1.8 for both dust components), leads to values
of L850µm,rest that are mostly consistent with those derived
from the single-band measurement (blue line and outlined
histogram).
We find a significant range in the relative reference lumisingle−band
nosities, LSED
850µm,rest /L850µm,rest , derived for each set of
MAGPHYS assumptions. Even when the assumptions on β
and Tdust are matched to the single-band method the ratio
varies from 0.7 − 1.6 (Figure 5). This distribution of values
can be attributed mainly to the variation in the relative masses
of the warm and cold dust components fit by MAGPHYS, but

may also reflect small variations in the intrinsic gas-to-dust
ratios of the sample.
We find that mismatches between the assumed β and Tdust
vs the intrinsic properties of the sources can lead to up to
a factor of two uncertainty on L850µm,rest . The mean variation of values of LSED
850µm,rest inferred per source, for different
sets of MAGPHYS assumptions, was 20%, with differences
of up to 70%. Likewise, the values of LSED
850µm,rest , derived
from the standard MAGPHYS assumptions, differed from the
Lsingle−band
850µm,rest values by 20% on average, with differences of
up to 70%. These results are consistent with the comparison of the inferred and intrinsic L850µm,rest for the simulated
galaxies of Privon et al. (2018), for which the extrapolation
from the observed frequency to the rest frame at 850µm resulted in errors of the order of ∼ 20%, with deviations of up
to 50% for some snapshots.
Our comparison of LSED
850µm,rest indicates that the value
of α850 derived by calibrating the CO(1-0)-derived Mmol
against the L850µm,rest , is systematically affected by the assumptions on the dust emissivity index and temperature. For
example, Hughes et al. (2017), who apply the standard form
of MAGPHYS to derive L850µm,rest from the SEDs of their
sample, find a slightly lower α850 than Scoville et al. (2016),
based on the single-band conversion of Equation (5). The

lower values found by Hughes et al. (2017) are consistent
with our findings that the LSED
850µm,rest estimated from the
standard MAGPHYS SED models are 20% lower, on average,
than for the single-band method. However, based on the χ2
values of the MAGPHYS SED fits, none of the four sets of
model assumptions (on β and Tcold dust ) that we tested result
in a better systematic fit to the photometry.
4.2. CO(1-0) vs. Dust Continuum Luminosity
We compare the luminosities used to derive Mmol in Figure 6. For the CO-detected sources, the observed-frame luminosity (at 343.5 GHz) correlates strongly (Pearson rank
correlation coefficient of 0.78) with the CO(1-0) luminosity
(left hand panel). This strong correlation remains even after the 343.5 GHz flux is scaled to L850µm,rest (blue points,
central panel), indicating that the dust continuum traces the
same component of molecular gas as the CO(1-0) emission
for our sample. The values of L850µm,rest derived from both
the single-band fluxes and SEDs are mostly consistent with
the predictions from the L850µm,rest -to-Mmol conversion factors derived by Scoville et al. (2016) (solid and dotted lines in
Figure 6), with all but source 12, consistent to within a factor
of two.

masses are the right y-axis, L850µm,rest , divided by α850µm =
6.7 × 1019 erg s−1 Hz−1 M−1 whereas the CO(1-0) based molecular gas masses are the top x-axis, L0CO(1−0) , multiplied by αCO =
6.5 M /(K km s−1 pc2 ).

We compare the scatter of our sample, around the best-fit
line of L0CO(1−0) vs L850µm,rest , with the scatter of the calibration sample of Scoville et al. (2016). To quantify the scatter and the goodness of fit compared to the predictions from
the mean and best-fit α850µm , we compute the standardized
residuals. By comparing the standardized residuals of the
two samples we account for the difference in samples sizes
and dynamic ranges.
We use the residuals, given by,
e = L0CO(1−0),measured − L0CO(1−0),predicted ,

(8)

to calculate the standardized residuals, via,
e/σe ,

(9)

where σe is the standard deviation of residuals. For each
source, L0CO(1−0),predicted is inferred from the value of
L850µm,rest derived from our Band 7 dust continuum flux
measurements (via Equation (5)) as well as: (1) the mean,
α850µm , and (2), the best-fit α850µm (L850µm,rest ), derived

T HE M OLECULAR G AS R ESERVOIRS OF z ∼ 2 G ALAXIES
for the Scoville et al. (2016) calibration sample. We compare the distributions of the standardized residuals from our
sample against the Scoville et al. (2016) calibration sample
in Figure 7. Note that for the chosen α850µm to be a good fit,
the distribution of standardized residuals should approximate
a normal distribution, with 95% between -2 and +2. Because
the best-fit α850µm was derived as a fit to the calibration data,
the standardized residuals should be centred at 0, and, indeed
we find a mean (median) standardized residual of 0.00 (0.15).
Our sample exhibits the same level of scatter as the calibration sample of Scoville et al. (2016) and is well fit by
the constant and best-fit α850µm , derived using the calibration sample. For both our sample, and the calibration sample, the standard deviation of the distribution of standardized
residuals ≈ 1.0, indicating that our sample exhibits the same
variation around the line of best fit as the calibration sample.
Our sample exhibits a very small (and insignificant) offset
from the best fit to the calibration sources, with a mean (median) standardized residual of -0.40 (-0.36). Moreover, the
standardized residuals of our sample lie within, |e/σe | < 2,
indicating that the line that best fits the calibration data is also
suitable for our sample.
We find no significant difference in the goodness of fit
when applying the mean vs best-fit α850µm of Scoville et al.
(2016), with almost identical distributions of the standardized residuals for both cases (filled red vs solid red outlined
histogram, Figure 7). Moreover, the mean α850µm of our
sample, 7.7 ± 2.3 × 1019 erg s−1 Hz−1 M−1 , is consistent
with the mean of the calibration samples. Thus, we conclude that the application of the constant value, hα850µm i =
6.7 ± 1.7 × 1019 erg s−1 Hz−1 M−1 , is valid for our sample.
4.3. The Accuracy of CO(1-0) and Dust Continuum-Based
Molecular Gas Masses
The molecular gas masses derived from the RJ dust continuum are consistent with those derived from CO(1-0) (Figure
8). For six of the 10 CO-detected sources, the values of Mmol
derived from the single-band RJ method are consistent within
the errors, whereas for all CO-detected sources, the values
of Mmol are consistent to within a factor of 1.7. The main
source of uncertainty in measuring Mmol from the dust continuum is the conversion to a common rest-frame luminosity.
As discussed in Section 4.1, the variation of β and < Tdust >
alone are sufficient to account for the differences in the derived L850µm,rest and thus also the differences between the
RJ and CO-based Mmol .
We investigate whether the scatter about the 1:1 line in Figure 8 correlates with any observed galaxy properties (Figure
9). To quantify the scatter, we use the relative luminosities,
L850µm,rest /L0CO(1−0) . Note that this is equivalent to the ratio between the value of Mmol determined from the singleband RJ method and CO(1-0) (Mmol,RJ /Mmol,CO(1−0) ). We

13

find no statistically significant correlation with the stellar
mass, SFR or main sequence offset within our sample (Spearman rank coefficients of < 0.3 with p-values of > 0.5), despite our sample spanning an order of magnitude in both M∗
and SFR.
The robustness of L850µm,rest as a molecular gas tracer for
our sample, appears to be consistent with recent studies based
on cosmological zoom-in simulations. Privon et al. (2018)
and Liang et al. (2018) compared the RJ-derived Mmol with
the Mmol of simulated massive star-forming galaxies, finding that the RJ-based Mmol correlates well with “true” Mmol
of their simulated galaxies. The strong correlation only
appeared to break down for sources with L850µm,rest <
1028 erg s−1 or log (Z/Z ) < −0.8 (Privon et al. 2018),
which are likely to have significantly higher gas-to-dust ratios than expected for our sample. The fact that we find
such strong agreement between the CO-derived Mmol and
RJ-based Mmol , indicates that our sources have similar gasto-dust ratios to the calibration samples of Scoville et al.
(2016).
The assumption of a constant gas-to-dust abundance ratio
is implicit in the RJ method, for which the calibration and
application has so far been intentionally restricted to galaxies
with M∗ > 2 × 1010 M (Scoville et al. 2016, 2017). These
massive sources are expected to be high metallicity systems,
with gas-to-dust ratios of the order of ∼ 100 : 1 and little COdark gas (Bolatto et al. 2013). Based on the Mdust inferred
via MAGPHYS, and the αCO used here, our sample has gasto-dust ratios of the order of ∼ 300 : 1. Although there likely
exists some variation in these values, which contributes to the
scatter about the 1:1 line in Figure 8, it is not sufficient to lead
to any significant offset in Mmol . We note that these results
are consistent with the work of Groves et al. (2015), who find
that the total gas mass can be constrained to within a factor
of two for massive galaxies.
We do not find any major deviations between the COand RJ- derived gas masses of our sample. However, significant deviations are to be expected for low metallicity,
and low M∗ , galaxies. For example, Groves et al. (2015)
and Privon et al. (2018) show that for low metallicity (low
M∗ ) galaxies, the calibration based on higher mass sources
(such as the one tested here) would underpredict the observed L0CO(1−0) , or simulated Mmol , respectively. Similarly, Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. (2015) find that low-mass,
MS galaxies at z ∼ 2 show smaller α850µm than our sample
by ∼ 0.4 dex. These low mass galaxies are likely to have significantly higher gas-to-dust ratios, of ∼ 1000 : 1, (e.g. Popping et al. 2017) than the samples to which the RJ method
has so far been applied (which have ratios of ∼ 100 : 1).
Hence, the constant gas-to-dust abundance ratio, implicit in
the RJ method, is not applicable to low M∗ sources. The underprediction of the CO-derived Mmol for low M∗ sources

would be even more pronounced if one were to account for
the expected variation of αCO with metallicity (e.g. Bell et al.
2006; Wolfire et al. 2010; Shetty et al. 2011; Feldmann et al.
2012; Bolatto et al. 2013).
Our results indicate that for massive, star-forming galaxies, the main source of uncertainty in deriving Mmol remains
the conversion factor, αCO . The value of αCO we have
adopted does not affect the relative comparison of the Mmol
derived via CO(1-0) and the long-wavelength dust continuum, both of which depend on the same αCO . However, it
has a significant impact on the absolute Mmol inferred via either method. As argued in previous studies, the value of αCO
is likely to vary across the calibration samples, with values of
∼ 4, ∼ 1.3 and ∼ 0.8M /(K km s−1 pc2 ) derived for SFGs,
ULIRGs and SMGs, respectively (see list of references in
Bolatto et al. 2013). In addition to the αCO adopted here,
this variation can lead to a factor of . 8 uncertainty in the
derived Mmol , far more than the factor of ∼ 2 uncertainty
introduced by the assumptions of β and hTdust i in the RJ
method (Section 4.1).
5. SUMMARY

We have presented a comparison of the molecular gas
masses derived from dust continuum and CO(1-0) observations for a unique sample of 12, z ∼ 2 star-forming galaxies. This is the first time that the Rayleigh-Jeans method
of measuring molecular gas masses from single-band, dust
continuum observations has been tested on the types of highredshift sources to which it is typically applied (Scoville et al.
2016, 2017; Schinnerer et al. 2016; Miettinen et al. 2017;
Darvish et al. 2018).
The dust-continuum method we have tested is based on the
calibration of the rest-frame 850µm luminosity (L850µm,rest )
against the CO(1-0)-derived molecular gas masses, proposed
by Scoville et al. (2016). We applied two techniques to derive the rest-frame 850µm luminosity: (1), using the cali-

bration of Scoville et al. (2016), based on the observed dustcontinuum emission at 343.5 GHz (ALMA Band 7), and (2)
from the model fits to the rest-frame SEDs.
Our work can be summarised as follows:
1. We find that the molecular gas masses derived from
single-band, long-wavelength flux measurements are consistent, within a factor of two, with the molecular gas
masses derived from CO(1-0), for M∗ > 2 × 1010 M
star-forming galaxies, when the same αCO , is assumed.
2. This factor of < 2 variation between the Mmol derived
from CO(1-0) vs the single-band dust continuum, can be
accounted for by variations in the dust emissivity index
and temperature, which are assumed when extrapolating
from the observed flux to L850µm,rest . Small variations in
the gas-to-dust ratios are also likely to contribute to this
scatter.
3. The main source of uncertainty in deriving Mmol , regardless of whether one uses CO(1-0) or the dust continuum,
remains the CO-to-Mmol conversion factor, αCO , which
varies by a factor of up to ∼ 8.
We conclude that single-band, dust-continuum observations can be used to constrain the molecular gas masses of
massive (M∗ > 2 × 1010 M ), star-forming galaxies at high
redshift as reliably as the CO(1-0) line. Thus, future singleband surveys with ALMA will provide important constraints
on the physics of star formation in massive, high-z galaxies.

A. DATA

We provide the data for our sources here. In Figure 10, we provide all 16 observed VLA spectra, extracted at the source
position. The spectral line fits described in Section 2.2 are shown in Figure 11 and the dust continuum and CO(1-0) emission
maps of our final sample of CO-detected sources are shown in Figure 12. The SED fits, described in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.3.1, are
shown along with the photometric measurements on which they are based in Figure 13.

Figure 12. Comparison of the ALMA dust continuum (left map) and integrated VLA CO(1-0) maps for sources with CO(1-0) detections. The
source number is labeled at the top left of the left hand panel in each row. The rms value is given in the bottom right corner of each map. Left
column: ALMA observations at 343.5 GHz. Contours are shown for ±2, 3, 5 and 10σ (dashed contours for negative values). Right columns:
Channel maps around the measured (expected) CO(1-0) line. For each source, the central panel of the VLA channel map represents the moment
zero map and is centred at the central velocity of the CO spectrum. The velocity width of the integrated maps is chosen to encompass the full
source emission (1.2×FWHM of the CO(1-0) line for sources other than 4 and 5). Contours are shown for ±2, 3 and 5σ (dashed contours for
negative values). The red cross indicates the expected position of the source, at which the CO spectrum was extracted. The colour shading
indicates the flux density in mJy/beam.

Figure 13. Rest-frame SEDs of the CO(1-0) detected galaxies. The inset focuses on the portion of the rest-frame spectrum around 850µm,
comparing the single-band (blue) and SED-derived (red) L850µm,rest , where the single-band derived value is calculated from Equation (5).
Note that the best-fit SED and value of L850µm,rest shown are based on the standard MAGPHYS assumptions of β = 1.5 and 2.0 for the warm
and cold components, respectively, with the temperature of the cold dust component as a free parameter. The black filled circles represent the
photometry used to fit the SEDs whereas the black triangles show the radio fluxes, which were not used to fit the SEDs.
