Abstract. We discuss various analytical and geometrical aspects of the
Levi form, which is associated with a CR manifold having any CR dimension and any CR codimension.

1. Introduction
The Levi form is a rather important geometric notion, which appears in a
fundamental way in several complex variables, complex differential geometry, algebraic geometry, in certain aspects of partial differential equations,
and in particular in the theory of Cauchy-Riemann structures on real manifolds (known for short as CR manifolds). Its role is to measure certain second order effects, which are of natural interest in those subjects. However it
appears in various incarnations, and many different authors have used it in
different ways, each employing their own peculiar notation, way of writing
it, and their own understanding of its geometric significance.
This has often led to confusion, in which even experts are unable to easily
decipher what some other researcher has written. This article is an attempt
to rectify the situation, and especially to establish once and for all a good
and consistent notation, which distinguishes among the various incarnations of the Levi form. We hope that in the future mathematicians will find
it helpful and convenient to adopt our conventions.
For the convenience of the reader, and to make everything understandable to people not already familiar with the Levi form, we have begun with
a discussion of almost complex manifolds, passing to complex manifolds,
then to abstractly defined CR manifolds (or almost CR manifolds), and finally to the situation of locally CR embeddable CR manifolds. And along
the way, we try to keep track of the various aspects of the Levi form which
naturally appear and explain the connections among them.
We have also stressed the various geometric meanings, of which there are
several. In the CR embedded case, we explain the connection of the Levi
form with the second fundamental form with respect to the induced metric
from the ambient space. Finally, for the important case of homogeneous CR

manifolds, we explain how the Levi form can be computed from the point
of view of Lie algebra, and illustrate it with a couple of examples.
2. Almost complex manifolds and the Nijenhuis tensor
Let M be a smooth (real) manifold of dimension 2n. An almost complex structure on M is a smooth assignment of a complex structure on each
fiber of T M, i.e. a fiber preserving smooth map J : T M → T M which is linear on the fibers and satisfies J 2 = −Id. This map J uniquely extends to
a smooth vector bundle automorphism of the complexified tangent bundle
CT M ( = C ⊗ T M), which we denote by the same symbol J. The condition
J 2 = −Id implies that J has eigenvalues i and −i, and we get a decomposition
CT M = T 1,0 M ⊕ T 0,1 M

(2.1)

into the corresponding eigenspaces
T 1,0 M = {X − iJX | X ∈ T M}
and
T 0,1 M = {X + iJX | X ∈ T M}.
We also note that
(2.2)

T 0,1 M = T 1,0 M,.

We call T 1,0 M the T 1,0 -bundle, and T 0,1 M the T 0,1 -bundle of the almost
complex structure J.
To simplify notation, in the following we will use the same symbol for
both vector fields and tangent vectors, whenever we believe this will not
cause confusion.
Equivalently, an almost complex structure can be defined by the assigning of its T 1,0 -bundle. Indeed, for each smooth complex subbundle T 1,0 M
of CT M satisfying (2.1) with T 0,1 M := T 1,0 M, there is a unique almost
complex structure with this T 1,0 -bundle.
Since by (2.1) the spaces T x1,0 M do not contain nontrivial purely imaginary vectors, taking the real part is an R-linear isomorphism R x of T x1,0 M
onto T x M and therefore we may define J on T x M by requiring that X−iJX ∈
T x1,0 M. The complex structure J on T M extends to an anti-involution J C on
CT M, which is multiplication by i on T 1,0 M and (−i) on T 0,1 M. With the
notation
R : T 1,0 M → T M, R(X) = 12 (X+ X̄), ∀X ∈ T 1,0 M,
we have
JX = R(i ·R−1 (X)), ∀X ∈ T M.

In the same way, the T 0,1 -bundle can also be used to define the almost
complex structure, by giving a smooth complex subbundle T 0,1 M of CT M
satisfying (2.1) with T 1,0 M := T 0,1 M.
We refer the reader to [B] for more details.
A complex manifold M admits an almost complex structure, which can
be described by using its complex coordinate charts to locally define its
T 1,0 -bundle to be the span of
!
1 ∂
∂
∂
≔
−i
, j = 1, . . . , n,
∂z j
2 ∂x j
∂y j
for any set of local holomorphic coordinates z1 =x1 +iy1 , . . . , zn = xn +iyn ,
with underlying real coordinates x j , y j ( j=1, . . . , n). By the holomorphic
chain rule, this is a good definition and we call this object the almost complex structure defined by the complex structure of M.
On the other hand, not every almost complex structure is defined by a
complex structure. If T 1,0 M is the T 1,0 -bundle of an almost complex structure defined by a complex structure, then the formal integrability condition
(2.3)

[T 0,1 M, T 0,1 M] ⊂ T 0,1 M

is satisfied. This means that if X and Y are smooth (real) vector fields, then
the commutator of X + iJX and Y + iJY is of the same sort, i.e.
[X + iJX, Y + iJY] = Z + iJZ
for some smooth (real) vector field Z. One easily checks that this formal
integrability condition is equivalent to the vanishing of the Nijenhuis tensor,
defined in [NW] by
(2.4)

N(X, Y) = [X, Y] − [JX, JY] + J[X, JY] + J[JX, Y]

for X, Y ∈ Γ(M, T M). The Newlander-Nirenberg theorem [NN] asserts that
formal integrability of an almost complex structure implies in fact integrability, i.e. there exists a complex structure which defines the almost complex
structure. An improved version of this theorem requiring a minimal amount
of smoothness of the almost complex structure can be found in [HT].
3. Embedded and abstract (almost) CR manifolds
Let M be a smooth manifold of real dimension 2n+k. An almost CR
structure (HM, J) of type (n, k) on M consists of the data of a smooth subbundle HM ⊆ T M of fiber dimension 2n and a fiber preserving smooth
vector bundle isomorphism J : HM −→ HM satisfying J 2 = −Id. An
almost CR manifold of type (n, k) is a smooth manifold endowed with an
almost CR structure of type (n, k). The number n is called the CR dimension and k the CR codimension of M. In the following we will avoid for
simplicity, whenever possible, to explicitly mention regularity assumptions
on the manifolds under consideration.

An almost complex structure on a real manifold M of dimension 2n is
therefore the same as an almost CR structure of CR codimension zero.
As in the almost complex case, an almost CR structure of type (n, k) on
M can be equivalently defined by the datum of a complex subbundle T 1,0 M
of complex fiber dimension n, of the complexified tangent bunde CT M,
satisfying
(3.1)

T 1,0 M ∩ T 0,1 M = {0},

where T 0,1 M = T 1,0 M,

(this is equivalent to (2.1) if k = 0). Since T 1,0 M does not contain purely
imaginary vectors, the real parts of its vectors form a real subbundle HM,
with fiber dimension 2n of T M and J is defined on HM by requiring that
X−iJX ∈T 1,0 M for all X∈HM. We have T 1,0 M = {X − iJX | X ∈ HM},
T 0,1 M = {X + iJX | X ∈ HM}, and T 1,0 M ⊕ T 0,1 M = CHM, where CHM is
the complexification of HM, i.e. the complex linear span of HM in CT M.
We call T 1,0 M the T 1,0 -bundle, and T 0,1 M the T 0,1 -bundle of the almost
CR structure J.
An almost CR structure on M is called a CR structure if the formal integrability condition
[T 0,1 M, T 0,1 M] ⊆ T 0,1 M,

(3.2)

is satisfied. Equation (3.2) means that for X, Y ∈ Γ(M, T 1,0 M) their commutator [X, Y] still belongs to Γ(M, T 1,0 M). Since
[X + iJX, Y + iJY] = [X, Y] − [JX, JY] + i{[X, JY] + [JX, Y]},
for X, Y ∈ Γ(M, HM), formal integrability can be reformulated in terms of
real vector fields by the two conditions, the second one involving a Nijenhuis tensor on HM:
(3.3)
(3.4)

[X, Y] − [JX, JY] ∈ Γ(M, HM)
N(X, Y)=[X, Y]−[JX, JY]+J([X, JY]+[JX, Y])=0
∀X, Y ∈ Γ(M, HM).

Prime examples of CR structures of CR dimension n are provided by the
real submanifolds M of a complex manifold X for which
(3.5)

dimC (CT x M ∩ T x1,0 X) = n for all x ∈ M.

Note that dimR M≥2n and dimC X ≥ dimR M − n.
It is easy to check that

T 1,0 M := CT x M ∩ T x1,0 X x∈M

is a smooth complex subbundle (of complex fiber dimension n) of CT M
satisfying (3.1), (3.2) and therefore induces a CR structure (HM, JM ) of
type (n, k) on M, where, with RZ := Z+Z
for Z ∈ T 1,0 X,
2
HM := R(T 1,0 M)

and

JM X ≔ R(iR−1 X),

∀X ∈ H x M, x ∈ M.

ASPECTS OF THE LEVI FORM

We say that this CR structure on M is induced from the complex structure
of X. If J : T X → T X is the almost complex structure of X induced by its
complex structure, i.e.
JX = R(iR−1 X)

for all

X ∈ T X,

then JM is the restriction of J to HM. In this situation, we say that M is CR
embedded in X.
The embedding codimension ℓ of M in X is always greater or equal to
the CR codimension k of M and ℓ−k is even (the complex dimension of X
is m=n+ 21 (k+ℓ)).
For each point x0 of M we can find an open neighbourhood U of x0 in X
such that M ∩ U is given by
(3.6)

M ∩ U = {x ∈ U | ρ1 (x) = 0, . . . , ρℓ (x) = 0}

with smooth real valued functions ρ1 , . . . , ρℓ satisfying
dρ1 ∧ . . . ∧ dρℓ , 0 on

M ∩ V.

Then, for the T 1,0 - and T 0,1 -bundles, we have, for x ∈ M ∩ U,

(3.7)
T x1,0 M = Z ∈ T x1,0 X ∂ρ1 (Z) = . . . = ∂ρℓ (Z) = 0 ,

T x0,1 M = Z ∈ T x0,1 X ∂ρ1 (Z) = . . . = ∂ρℓ (Z) = 0 .
(3.8)

In particular, M is generically embedded (near x0 ) if and only if
(3.9)

∂ρ1 ∧ . . . ∧ ∂ρℓ , 0

on a neighbourhood of x0 in V.
The notion of embedded CR manifolds leads us to briefly discuss CR
maps and CR embeddings in a more general setting:
If (M, HM, J) is a CR manifold and X is a complex manifold, then M is CR
embeddable into X if one can find a smooth embedding Ψ : M −→ X such
that Ψ(M) is CR embedded in X and its induced CR structure agrees with
the pushforward by Ψ of the abstract CR structure on M. This means that Ψ
and Ψ−1 are CR maps, according to the definition below:
Let M1 and M2 be CR manifolds. A smooth map Ψ : M1 → M2 is called CR
if Ψ∗ (T 1.0 M1 ) ⊆ T 1,0 M2 . An equivalent definition, not involving the complexification of the differential, requires that
(3.10)

Ψ∗ (HM1 ) ⊆ HM2 and Ψ∗ ◦J1 = J2 ◦Ψ∗

(where we set Jh for the CR structure on Mh , h=1, 2). If, moreover, Ψ is a
diffeomorphism and Ψ∗ (T 1,0 M1 ) = T 1,0 M2 , then Ψ is called a CR isomorphism.
A CR manifold is called locally embeddable if it admits local CR embeddings into some complex Euclidean space. One can prove (see, e.g., [HTa1,
p. 118] or [B, p. 187]) that each locally embeddable C∞ -smooth CR manifold admits local CR embeddings whose images are generically embedded.

More details can be found in [B] and [BER].
Real-analytic CR manifolds are always embeddable (see e.g. [AH72, AF79]),
but, in contrast to the complex situation (when k = 0), the formal integrability condition (3.2) is, for arbitrary C∞ -smooth CR manifolds, not sufficient
to provide local embedding into complex manifolds. The local CR embedding problem is in fact very difficult and will not be discussed in this survey.
4. The Levi form of (almost) CR manifolds
Let M be a smooth real manifold with an almost CR structure of type
(n, k). The Levi form of M at x is the Hermitian symmetric map
Lx1,0 : T x1,0 M × T x1,0 M −→ CT x M/CH x M
defined by Lx1,0 (Zx , W x ) = 2i1 πx ([Z, W]x ). Here πx is the canonical projection πx : CT x M → CT x M/CH x M, and Z, W are smooth sections of T 1,0 M
extending Zx , W x . The class of [Z, W]x in CT x M/CH x M is in fact independent of the choice of the extensions. Indeed, let L1 , . . . , Ln be a smooth basis
of T 1,0 M near x. If Z ′ , W ′Pare smooth sectionsPof T 1,0 M with Zx′ = Zx and
W x′ = W x , then Z ′ = Z + j α j L j , W ′ = W + j β j L j , for smooth complex
valued functions α j , β j vanishing at 0. Then the value at x of

= CH x M. The (fiberwise) linear projection

R : CT M ∋ X −→ RX = 21 (X+X̄) ∈ T M
of CT M onto T M along iT M induces by passing to the quotients a left inverse b
R : CT M/CH → T M/HM, of the inclusion T M/HM ֒→ CT M/CHM
which factors T M ֒→ CT M.
Let x ∈ M. Since R is a real linear isomorphism from T x1,0 M onto H x M,
we have a well-defined real bilinear map Lx : H x M × H x M → T x M/H x M
making the following diagram commute:

where, to obtain the last equality, we used the facts that πx is complex linear

[JX, Y] ≡ [J 2 X, JY] = −[X, JY]

and hence
(4.2)

Lx (X x , Yx ) = πx ([JX, Y]) = πx ([JY, X]).

For the corresponding quadratic forms

Almost CR structures satisfying (3.3) were already considered in [T] and
are called partially integrable (see also [CS]).
The direction of L x (X) does not change when X is replaced by another
tangent vector in the real span of {X, JX}; indeed, if Y = aX + bJX, then
(4.4)

L x (Y) = (a2 + b2 )L x (X).

In many situations, it is useful to also consider scalar Levi forms (as
considered e.g. in [AFN] and [HN]). For this, we need to introduce the
characteristic conormal bundle, which is the annihilator
H 0 M = {ξ ∈ T ∗ M | ξ(X) = 0 ∀X ∈ Γ(M, HM)}.
of HM in T ∗ M.
We define a family of scalar Levi forms parametrized by ξ in the characteristic conormal bundle as follows: Given ξ ∈ H x0 M and X x , Yx ∈ H x M, we
choose smooth sections ξ̃ of H 0 M and X, Y of HM extending ξ, Yx , Yx . By
the invariant formula for the exterior derivative (see, e.g., [S, p. 213]),
d ξ̃(X, Y) = X(ξ̃(Y)) − Y(ξ̃(X)) − ξ̃([X, Y]).
Since ξ̃(X) = ξ̃(Y) = 0, this implies
d ξ̃(X x , Yx ) = −ξ([X, Y]).
Hence both sides depend only on ξ, X x , Yx and we define
(4.5)

L x (ξ, X x ) = ξ([JX, X]) = d ξ̃(X, JX),

on H x M. Note that L x (ξ, ·) is Hermitian for the complex structure J on
H x M: i.e. L x (ξ, JX x ) = L x (ξ, X x ).

8

J. BRINKSCHULTE, C.D. HILL, J. LEITERER, AND M. NACINOVICH

The image R x of L x is a real cone in T x M/H x M. Its dual cone
R0x = {ξ ∈ H x0 M | L x (ξ, X) ≥ 0, ∀X ∈ H x M}
is a closed convex cone in H x0 M.
It is also useful to consider the characteristic conormal sphere bundle
0
S M = (H 0 M\{0})/R+ whose typical fiber is the (k−1)-dimensional sphere.
If ̟ : H 0 M\{0} → S 0 M is the canonical projection, then ̟(R0 \{0}) is the
total space of a bundle on M which has semialgebraic fibers and consist of a
finite number of closed connected components if M itself is semialgebraic.
The scalar Levi forms L x (ξ, X) enable us to microlocalize with respect
to the Levi form L x (X). A geometric version of this microlocalization is
discussed in [HN1, §5].
When we think this would not cause confusion, we will drop the subscript
“x” and simply write L for L x .
5. Levi form of an embedded CR manifold
Assume that M is a (2n+k)-dimensional smooth real submanifold of an
m-dimensional complex manifold X (with m≥n+k) and that (3.5) holds true,
so that the complex structure of X induces on M a CR structure (HM, J) of
type (n, k). Our first goal in this section is to express the Levi form in terms
of defining functions for M. To simplify notation and better understand the
invariant meaning of the construction, it is convenient to introduce the real
operator
d c = i(∂¯ − ∂),

satisfying ∂ = 12 (d+i·d c ), ∂¯ = 21 (d−i·d c ), 2i·∂∂¯ = dd c.

By considering the local situation, we can assume that our CR manifold
M, of type (n, k), is given by
(5.1)

M ∩ U = {z ∈ U | ρ1 (z) = . . . = ρℓ (z) = 0},

with ℓ=2m−2n−k≥k, for a system ρ1 , . . . , ρℓ of real C∞ defining functions,
defined on an open neighborhood U of xo ∈ M in X and satisfying dρ1 ∧
. . . ∧ dρℓ , 0 on M. By (3.7), the vectors X in HM are characterised by
d c ρ j (X) = 0 for 1≤ j≤ℓ and therefore the pullbacks d c ρ1 T M , . . . , d c ρℓ T M of
the d c ’s of the defining functions on M span the characteristic bundle H 0 M.
However they are not linearly independent if ℓ>k.
For a section X of HM, with X=R(Z)= 21 (Z+Z̄) for Z∈T 1,0 M, we have
by (4.5)
(5.2)

¯ j (X, JX) = ∂∂ρ
¯ j (Z, Z̄).
L(d c ρ j , X) = dd cρ j (X, JX) = 2i∂∂ρ

Then (5.2) yields

Note that, when the embedding is generic (ℓ=k) the d c ρ j ’s are a basis of
H 0 M and the ξ j are uniquely determined by ξ.
Formula (5.4) is actually the classical definition of the scalar Levi forms
which was used for a long time by various authors (e.g. [AFN], [ChSh],
[HTa2], [Hen]).
The Levi form yields important information on the geometry of the embedding M ֒→ X. In fact its signature is related to mutual positions of M
and holomorphic balls: By a p-dimensional holomorphic ball we mean the
image of a smooth embedding
F : B p = {z ∈ C p | |z| ≤ 1} −→ Cn+k
which is holomorphic on the open ball B p (1-dimensional holomorphic balls
are usually called holomorphic discs). Let us first consider the case k = 1 (a
piece of a real hypersurface in X). In this case H x0 M is one-dimensional, so
it is generated by one characteristic conormal direction ξ. Assume that the
scalar Levi form L x (ξ, ·) is nondegenerate and has p positive and q negative
eigenvalues (hence p + q = n). This means that we can find a p-dimensional
holomorphic ball lying on one side of M, touching M only with its center
at x, tangent to the p-dimensional positive eigenspace of L x (ξ, ·) and a qdimensional holomorphic ball lying on the other side of M, also touching M
only with its center at x, tangent to the q-dimensional negative eigenspace
of L x (ξ, ·) (see e.g. [AH, pp. 798-800]).
Vice versa, if L(ξ, · ) has for all nonzero ξ in H x0 M at least q negative
eigenvalues, all holomorphic balls of dimension d≥q+ 12 (ℓ+k) centered at x
have an intersection with M of positive dimension.
Now let k ≥ 1 be arbitrary, and let us assume that, for some ξ ∈ H x0 M,
the scalar Levi form L x (ξ, ·) has p positive eigenvalues. Then one can find
a holomorphic ball, of complex dimension p+ 12 (ℓ+k)−1, touching M only
with its center at x, where it is tangent to a complex p-dimensional complex
linear subspace of H x M on which L x (ξ, · ) is positive definite. Indeed, assuming as we can that ξ = d c ρ(x) for
real valued function vanish a smooth
P
ing on M, for a large real c the set ρ+c· ℓj=1 ρ2j = 0 defines near x a smooth
CR hypersurface having a Levi form with p+ 21 (ℓ+k)−1 positive eigenvalues.
Next we show that, after introducing a Hermitian metric on X, the Levi
form can be rewritten as a map with values in the normal space of M, as
was suggested in [Her].

A Riemannian metric g on X is Hermitian if the complex structure J is
an isometry on T X. In particular
g(X, JX) = 0 and g(JX, JX) = g(X, X), ∀X ∈ T X.

This is equivalent to the fact that g is the real part of a complex valued
Hermitian symmetric scalar product h. The tensors g and h are related by
h x (X, Y) = gx (X, Y) − i·g x (JX, Y), ∀x ∈ X, ∀X, Y ∈ T x X.

Let N M be the normal bundle of M in X, whose fibre at x ∈ M is the
space (T x M)⊥ = {X x ∈ T x X | g(X x , Yx ) = 0, ∀Yx ∈ T x M} and πN :T | M X → N M
the orthogonal projection. For X ∈ T | M X, we set X N M = πN (X).
Since HM = T M ∩ JT M, we have
HM = {X ∈ T M | πN (JX) = 0}
and therefore we obtain a commutative diagram

If M is given locally by a system of local defining functions (5.1), we
can use (5.2) to obtain a description of LN M . Indeed, the gradient ∇ f of
a real valued smooth function f is the real vector field characterised by
g(∇ f, X) = d f (X) for all X ∈ Γ(X, T X). Thus
L(d c ρ j , X) = d c ρ j ([JX, X]) = −dρ j (J [JX, X]) = −g(∇ρ j , J[JX, X])
and (5.3) expresses the scalar product of LN M (X) with the gradient of the
defining function ρ j . The matrix (g(∇ρ j , ∇ρh)) is symmetric and positive
and, if (A j,h ) is its inverse, we obtain

ℓ-tuple (∇ρ1 (x), . . . , ∇ρℓ (x)).

ASPECTS OF THE LEVI FORM

There is a unique linear connection ∇ for which both the metric tensor
g and the complex structure J are parallel (see e.g. [GH]). Let us assume

moreover that X is Kähler, so that the Hermitian and the Levi-Civita connections coincide. Denote by ∇ the covariant derivative on X. If X, Y are vector
fields on X which are tangent to M, then taking the normal component
(5.9)

B x (X, Y) = (∇Xx Y)N M ,

for x ∈ M,

of the covariant derivative of Y with respect to X defines an N M-valued
symmetric tensor on T M, which is called the second fundamental form of
the embedding of M into X. Likewise, the tangential projection ∇XM Y is the
covariant derivative of the Levi-Civita connection on M of g| M . The Levi
form LN M can be expressed by using the second fundamental form (see
[EHS] or [HTa2]):
(5.10)

LNx M (X) = B x (X, X) + B x (JX, JX)

Indeed, if X is a real vector field on X whose restriction to M takes values
in HM, we obtain, in view of (5.5) amd (5.6),
N M
N M
B x (X, X) + B x (JX, JX) = ∇X X
+ ∇JX JX
N M
N M
= ∇X X + J∇JX X
= J∇JX X − J∇X JX
N M
= J[JX, X]
= LN M (X).

Since the hermitian connection has no torsion on the two-dimensional planes
hX, JXi (see e.g, [KN]), the second fundamental form is meaningful on
complex tangent lines also in the non-Kähler situation, (5.10) also applies
in the more general case.
6. On the geometric meaning of the Levi form

In the remainder of this section, we want to make some more comments
on the geometrical interpretation of the Levi form. Let us start by discussing
its invariance under CR diffeomorphisms:
Let (M1 , T 1,0 M1 ) and (M2 , T 1,0 M2 ) be CR manifolds and Ψ : M1 → M2 a
CR map. By
(3.10) its differential Ψ∗ factors to yield a map
[Ψ∗ (x)] : T x M1 /(HM1 )x −→ T x M2 /(HM2 )x ,
between the quotient spaces and one can check that
M2
1
[Ψ∗ (x)] ◦ L M
x = LΨ(x) ◦ Ψ∗ (x).

In particular, the Levi form is invariant under CR diffeomorphisms.
When M is locally generically CR embedded into Cn+k , we can find lots
of local biholomorphic mappings near a fixed point x ∈ M. All of them induce local CR diffeomorphisms of a neighborhood of x in M onto a generic
CR submanifold of codimension k sitting in another Euclidean space of the

12

J. BRINKSCHULTE, C.D. HILL, J. LEITERER, AND M. NACINOVICH

same complex dimension n+k. Even though the image of M under such a
local CR diffeomorphism may look quite different geometrically, its Levi
form is invariant. An illustration of this is the fact that a strictly pseudoconvex hypersurface may not be convex, but it is locally CR diffeomorphic to
a hypersurface that is strictly convex, in the elementary sense. Here by a
strictly pseudoconvex hypersurface we mean one whose Levi form is either
positive or negative definite.
More generally, as follows from Sylvester’s “law of inertia” for Hermitian forms, it is the signature of the Levi form that is invariant; by the “signature” of any scalar Levi form, we mean its number of positive, zero and
negative eigenvalues. It is therefore impossible to change the signature of
the Levi form by making any ambient biholomorphic change of coordinates.
Nonetheless a simple rescaling procedure permits to change the ”size” of a
nonzero eigenvalue.
Using formula (5.10), one can relate the Levi form of M to the extrinsic
curvature of M, when M is CR embedded. To see this, we assume that M is
embedded into Cm near some point x ∈ M. We will consider 2-dimensional
”ribbons” inside M constructed as follows: Let ℓ be a complex line in Cm
which passes through x and is tangent to M at x. The (local) image of the
exponential map exp : T M −→ M restricted to ℓ is then a little piece of
a real 2-dimensional surface Σ passing through x; actually Σ is obtained as
the union of all geodesics starting from x in all directions of ℓ. Equivalently,
Σ is locally given by the “slice” M ∩ span{ℓ, Nx M}.
Now assume that ℓ = span{X, JX}, and X ∈ H x M is of length one. Since
Nx M ⊂ Nx Σ, we then obtain from (5.10)
(6.1)

LN M (X) = B(X, X) + B(JX, JX)
N M
,
= BΣ (X, X) + BΣ (JX, JX)

where BΣ is the second fundamental form of Σ, whereas B is the second
fundamental form of M. From (6.1) we get the following geometric interpretation of the Levi form of M: LN M (X) is twice the projection of the mean
curvature vector of Σ onto Nx M.
We would like to emphasize that this mean curvature vector depends on
x and ℓ, but not on a particular choice of X. Indeed, if ℓ is spanned by Y
and JY, where Y = aX+bJX and a2 +b2 = 1, then we obtain the same mean
curvature vector. In fact LN M (Y) = LN M (X), as follows from (4.4).
In contrast to the Gauss curvature of a surface (which is a metric invariant
but may change under conformal maps), the mean curvature is known to be
a conformal invariant: it is possible to turn a strictly convex surface looking
like a skull-cap into a saddle while keeping the mean curvature, say positive.
An Example: tube CR manifolds. Let Γ be a smooth real manifold in
Rn+k , of real dimension n and real codimension k. Then M = Γ×Rn+k is a CR
manifold of type (n, k), generically CR embedded into Cn+k = Rn+k + iRn+k .
Indeed, if pr : M −→ Γ denotes the canonical projection, then T x1,0 M =

ASPECTS OF THE LEVI FORM

13

C ⊗ T pr(x) Γ. Following [HK], M is called a tube CR manifold over the base
Γ.
From (5.10) we can deduce that the Levi form of M at x is the second
fundamental form of Γ at pr(x): If we choose any real tangent vector X to
Γ at pr(x), then X is also tangent to M at x, and JX = iX points along the
flat fiber of M. Hence (5.10) implies
LN M (X) = B x (X, X) + B x (JX, JX) = B x (X, X)
N M
NΓ
= BΓpr(x) (X, X)
= BΓpr(x) (X, X)
= BΓpr(x) (X, X).

Therefore, assuming X has length one, LN M (X) = BΓpr(x) (X, X) is the normal
curvature vector to Γ at pr(x) in the direction X, and its length is the curvature of any curve in Γ passing through pr(x) having tangent vector X at
pr(x).
A similar observation applies to so-called Reinhardt CR manifolds. They
are of the form M = exp (Γ + iRn+k ), where exp denotes the exponential
map that sends z = (z1 , . . . , zn+k ) to exp z = (ez1 , . . . , ezn+k ). Reinhardt CR
manifolds are thus invariant under multiplication of each coordinate by a
different factor of modulus one, whereas tube CR manifolds are invariant
under translations in the pure imaginary direction.
7. The homogeneous case
Using a notation which is customary while dealing with homogeneous
spaces (see e.g. [Hel]) we add the subscript “0” to indicate real objects,
while complex object will be left unsubscripted.
For a smooth bundle pr : E → M we denote by Γ(M, E) the space { f ∈
∞
C (M, E) | pr◦ f = idM } of smooth sections of E over M.
7.1. Homogeneous CR manifolds and CR algebras.
Homogeneous spaces. Let M0 be a smooth real manifold and G0 a real Lie
group, with identity e. A differentiable action of G0 on M0 is a C∞ smooth
map

To each element X of the Lie algebra g0 of G0 we associate the smooth
vector field X ∗ ∈ Γ(M0 , T M) generating the flux (t, p) → exp(t·X)·p on M0 .
The space of X ∗ for X in g0 is a real Lie subalgebra of Γ(M0 , T M) for the
commutation of vector fields. The correspondence X → X ∗ is indeed an
antihomomorphism of Lie algebras, i.e. is R-linear and
[X ∗ , Y ∗ ] = −[X, Y]∗ , ∀X, Y ∈ g0 .
For each a ∈ G0, the map La (p) = a · p is a diffeomorphism of M0 , yielding by differentiation a diffeomorphism dLa : T M0 → T M0 . We will write

14

J. BRINKSCHULTE, C.D. HILL, J. LEITERER, AND M. NACINOVICH

for simplicity a · v instead of dLa (v) if a ∈ G0 and v∈T M0 , noting that also
the map
G0 × T M0 ∋ (a, v) → a·v ∈ T M0
is a smooth action of G0 on T M0 .
We say that M0 is G0 -homogeneous when the action of G0 is transitive,
i.e. when G0 · p = M0 for some, and hence for all, p in M0 . When this is the
case, T p M0 = {Xp∗ | X∈g0 } for all points p of M0 and therefore one can use
vector fields X ∗ to get local frames near any p in M0 .
The stabilizer Stab G0 (p0 )={x∈G0 | x·p0 =p0 } of any point p0 of M0 is a
closed Lie subgroup of G0 . Denote by stab g0 (p0 ) its Lie algebra.
If the action (7.1) is transitive, then M0 has a unique real analytic structure
such that for each point p0 the map
(7.2)

π : G0 ∋ a → a·p0 ∈ M0 ,

is a real analytic submersion and the injective quotient yields a real analytic
diffeomorphism
(7.3)

π̂ : G0 /Stab G0 (p0 ) →M0

and, by differentiating, a linear isomorphism
(7.4)

d π̂e : g0 /stab g0 (p0 ) → T p0 M0 .

Homogeneous CR manifolds. Let M0 is a CR manifold with structure bundle
HM and partial complex structure J.
We say that a differentiable action (7.1) is CR if the diffeomorfphisms
p →a·p of M0 are CR for all a in G0 . This means that
a · HM = HM and a ◦ J = J ◦ a.

This can be rephrased by using the complexification of the action of G0 on
T M0 , by requiring that either one holds true
a·T 1,0 M0 = T 1,0 M0 , or a·T 0,1 M0 = T 0,1 M0 , ∀a ∈ G0 .

We say that M0 is a G0 -homogeneous CR manifold if the action (7.1) of
the Lie group G0 on M0 is transitive and CR.
Fix a base point p0 in M0 and consider the smooth submersion (7.2). The
pullback
Q =π∗ (Γ(M0 , T 0,1 M0 ))={ζ ∈ Γ(G0 , CT G0 | dπ(ζa )∈T a0,1
·p0 , ∀a∈G0 }
of Γ(M0 , T 0,1 M0 ) to G0 is a formally integrable distribution of complex vector fields on G0 , which is invariant by left translations.
Let g be the complex Lie algebra obtained by complexifying g0 and set
(7.5)

q = {Z ∈ g | dπe (Z) ∈ T p0,1
M0 }.
0

For the following statements we refer to [AMN1, AMN2, MN].
Proposition 7.1.
(1) The subspace q defined in (7.5) is a complex Lie
subalgebra of g.

ASPECTS OF THE LEVI FORM

15

(2) q ∩ q̄ equals the complexification of stabg0 (p0 ).
(3) A complex vector field ζ on G0 belongs to Q iff a−1
∗ ζa ∈ q for all
a ∈ G0 .
(4) Vice versa, any complex Lie subalgebra q of g with q ∩ q̄=C⊗R stab g0 (p0 ),
defines on a G0 -homogeneous space M0 a G0 -homogeneous CR
structure by setting
T a0,1
·p0 M0 = a · dπe (q), ∀a∈G0 .



A G0 -homogeneous CR structure on M0 is determined by the datum of
the antiholomorphic tangent space at a point. Thus, by Proposition 7.1,
having fixed a point p0 , the G0 -homogeneous CR structures on M0 are parameterized by the complex Lie subalgebras q of the complexification g of
g0 for which
(7.6)

q ∩ g0 = stabg0 (p0 ).

A different choice of the base point p0 changes Stab G0 (p0 ), stab g0 (p0 ) and q
by G0 -conjugation.
These remarks motivate the definiton in [MN] of CR-algebras as pairs
(g0 , q) consisting of a real Lie algebra g0 and a complex Lie subalgebra q of
g = C ⊗R g0 .
Indeed this notion encodes the possible realizations of M0 as a smooth
CR submanifold of a homogeneous complex manifold. Assume that:
• G0 admits a complexification G,
• there is a closed complex Lie subgroup Q of G with Lie algebra q
and Q ∩ G0 = Stab G0 (p0 ).
Then the inclusions G0 ֒→ G and Stab G0 (p0 ) ֒→ Q yield a smooth immersion of M0 into the complex homogeneous space M = G/Q and we have a
commutative diagram
G0 −−−−−→ G

M0 −−−−−→ M.
If we are only interested in the local setting, we can always assume that
the Lie group G0 is linear, thus admitting a complexification G, and that
Stab G0 (p0 ) is connected. However, the analytic Lie subgroup Q generated
by q may not be closed, (virtual in the sense of [O]). The quotient G/Q can
be thought in this case as a germ of smooth complex manifold providing a
local embedding of M0 near p0 .

7.2. The Levi form. For a G0 -homogeneous CR manifold M0 one can describe the Levi form at a point p0 by utilizing the attached CR algebra (g0 , q)
and Lie brackets on the complexification g of g0 . In fact we will consider
1,0
the sesquilinear form L1,0
p0 on T p0 M0 and the corresponding scalar Levi
forms, indexed by Hp00 M0 . With the submersion π of (7.2) we have indeed
T p1,0
M0 = dπe (q̄), where conjugation in g is taken with respect to the real
0

16

form g0 . The vector fields of the complex distribution Q generated by the
left-invariant vector fields Z ∗ with Z ∈ q are π-related to the elements of
Γ(M0 , T 0,1 M0 ). Hence we have (cf. e.g. [Hel, Ch.I, Prop.3.3])
dπp0 ([Z1 , Z̄2 ]) = [X1 , X̄2 ]p0
if Z1 , Z2 ∈ Q , X1 , X2 ∈ Γ(M0 , T 1,0 M0 ) and π∗ (Zi ) = Xi , i=1, 2. Hence one
obtains the following.
Proposition 7.2. Let pr : g → g/(q + q̄) be the projection onto the quotient
and ̟ the isomorphism of g/(q + q̄) with CT p0 M0 /CHp0 M0 defined by the
isomorphism dπe : g → CT p0 M0 , with dπe (q + q̄) = CHp0 M0 .
Then the Levi form of M0 at p0 is characterized by the commutative diagram

We illustrate by some examples the actual computation. We need to parameterise the quotient T p0 M0 by taking a linear complement of (q + q̄) ∩ g0
in g0 . Then we will write the Levi form L1,0
p0 as an n×n Hermitian symmetric matrix (with n equal to the CR dimension) depending upon k real
parameters (with k equal to the CR codimension). The Hermitian symmetric forms obtained by fixing the real values of the parameters are the scalar
Levi forms.
Example 7.3. We consider the flag manifold M consisting of the pairs
ℓ1 ⊂ℓ4 ⊂C6 , which is a compact complex manifold of complex dimension 11,
homogeneous space for the action of SL6 (C). Fixing on M the base point
p0 =(he1 i, he1 , e2 , e3 , e4i), its stabiliser Q in SL6 (C) is the complex parabolic
subgroup with Lie algebra

an isotropic line and he1 , e2 , e3, e4 i a 4 plane on which the restriction of B has
minimal rank. Hence the SU(2, 4)-orbit M0 of p0 in M is the minimal one.
The Lie algebra of SU(2, 4) is characterized by
su(2, 4) = {X∈sl6 (C) | X ∗ B + BX=0}.
Taking into account that B2 = I6 , it is the subalgebra of fixed points of the

To compute the CR type and the Levi form of M0 it is convenient to start
from a linear complement of q in sl6 (C) and construct the tangent to M0 at
p0 by adding, for each coefficient, its su(2, 4)-conjugate.
We obtain a representation of the tangent space to M0 at p0 of the form

The zi , which are the terms in the complement of q which by conjugation are
sent into a −z̄i lying in q, correspond to the analytic tangent and should be
therefore considered “complex” coordinates. The remaining terms, whose
conjugates stay in the complement of q, are the “real” coordinates, whose
entries will parametrise the Levi forms. The number of zi ’s is the CR dimension, twice the number of wi ’s plus the number or ti ’s is the CR codimension:
in this example, M0 is of type (3, 8) (we have z1 , z2, z3 and w1 , w2 , w3, t1 , t2 ).
The Levi form is 3×3 and depends on 3 complex (related to w1 , w2 , w3 ) and
two real (corresponding to i t1 , i t2) parameters. It can be represented by the

It is natural to take Zi to be the matrix corresponding to zi =1, z j =0 for j,i
to define a basis of T p1,0
M0 . In an analogous way we can build a basis for a
0
linear complement of CHp0 M0 in m by using the wi ’s and t j ’s.
The vector valued Levi form L1,0 is obtained by computing
i [Z, Z̄ ′ ]
for matrices Z, Z ′ of the form (∗∗) and e.g. the w1 in the entry (1, 2) of (∗)
means that L1,0 (Z1 , Z2 ) is a vector in m/(m ∩ (q + q̄)) proportional to the
projection of

The entries wi ’s and t j ’s of (∗) can also be taken as dual variables in Hp00 M.
In this way (∗) can be thought of as the scalar Levi form. We note that it
is identically zero on the 3-plane {w1 = 0, w2 = 0, t2 = 0} and that all
nondegenerate scalar Levi forms have at least one positive and one negative
eigenvalue.
Example 7.4. We consider the flag M of SO7 (C), consisting of the projective lines contained in the quadric
Q = {[z] ∈ CP6 | z1 z7 +z2 z6 +z3 z5 +z24 =0}
of CP6 . Take the matrix

Then
SO(1, 6) = {x∈SO(7, C) | x∗ Bx = B}.
In this way, the SO(1, 6)-orbit M0 through the line p0 ={[z] ∈ CP6 | z ∈
he1 , e2 i}⊂Q is the minimal orbit of SO(1, 6) in M.

In particular, all nonzero scalar Levi forms have signature +, −, 0, 0.
As explained in [AMN1], for homogeneous CR manifolds which, as the
examples discussed above, are orbits of real forms in complex flag manifolds, it is possible to compute the Levi form by combinatorics on root
