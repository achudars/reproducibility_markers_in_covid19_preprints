We present a calculation of the pion valence quark distribution extracted using the formalism of
reduced Ioffe time pseudo-distributions or more commonly known as pseudo-PDFs. Our calculation
is carried out on two different 2+1 flavor QCD ensembles using the isotropic-clover fermion action,
with lattice dimensions 243 × 64 and 323 × 96 at the lattice spacing of a = 0.127 fm, and with the
quark mass equivalent to a pion mass of mπ ' 415 MeV. We incorporate several combinations of
smeared-point and smeared-smeared pion source-sink interpolation fields in obtaining the lattice
QCD matrix elements using the summation method. After one-loop perturbative matching and
combining the pseudo-distributions from these two ensembles, we extract the pion valence quark
distribution using a phenomenological functional form motivated by the global fits of parton distribution functions. We also calculate the lowest four moments of the pion quark distribution through
the “OPE without OPE”. We present a qualitative comparison between our lattice QCD extraction
of the pion valence quark distribution with that obtained from global fits and previous lattice QCD
calculations.

INTRODUCTION

The key element of most predictions involving hard inclusive reactions in high-energy physics is the factorization theorem [1] of perturbative QCD. This factorization
procedure separates the perturbatively calculable hardscattering quark and gluon dynamics from the nonperturbative bound-state dynamics, described by the parton
distribution functions (PDFs) of the relevant hadrons.
For the nucleon, information about the quark PDFs
can be obtained from the experimental data of deep inelastic scattering. Numerous experiments have been performed, and the functional form of the valence quark
PDFs is well understood in various global fits [2–6].
On the other hand, the pion valence PDF has been extracted using the data from only a few pionic Drell-Yan
experiments at CERN [7, 8] and Fermilab [9]. The valence PDF of the pion is of particular theoretical interest,
as the pion is the lightest QCD bound state and the Goldstone mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of
chiral symmetry.
The accurate form of the pion’s valence quark distribution therefore provides a testing ground for both QCD
and QCD-based approaches in understanding the structure of hadrons. The experimental data of Refs. [7–9]
have been analyzed in Refs. [10–16] to determine the
pion valence distribution, and compare, in particular,
the results of these analyses at large x (fraction of the
hadron’s longitudinal momentum carried by the parton)
with the predictions of QCD-based hard-gluon-exchange
models [17–19].

The large-x behavior of the pion valence distribution has also been studied in different model
calculations [20–26]. However, despite having different
fits to the experimental data and model calculations, it
has not yet been settled whether the pion valence distribution near x → 1 falls off as (1 − x) or follows the
(1 − x)2 behavior suggested in Refs. [17–19].
Thus, the slope of the pion valence quark distribution
as x → 1 may provide important information about the
interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of
quark dynamics in the valence region. Because of its importance, understanding the large-x behavior of the pion
valence quark distribution is the goal of the approved
experiment C12-15-006 at Jefferson Lab [27]. Intensive
studies of the pion structure are also proposed for the
future Electron-Ion Collider [28].
Another way of studying the behavior of the pion valence quark distribution may be provided by lattice QCD
calculations which can be complementary to the global
fit analyses of the cross-section data and can also serve
as a discriminator between different model predictions.
To achieve such a goal, we need to go beyond the conventional moment calculations and obtain x-dependent
parton distributions. Several new approaches that allow
us to determine x-dependent parton distributions from
lattice QCD have been proposed. These approaches include the path-integral formulation of the deep-inelastic
scattering hadronic tensor [29], the inversion method [30],
quasi-PDFs [31], good lattice cross sections [32, 33],
and reduced Ioffe time pseudo-distributions (or pseudoPDFs) [34, 35]. An analogous coordinate-space method
has been earlier introduced for the calculation of light-

2
cone distribution amplitudes [36].
Although significant achievements in the lattice QCD
implementations of these approaches have been made in
recent years [37–48], a proper understanding and controlling various sources of systematics in these calculations
still require further exploration and theoretical development. The status of current lattice QCD calculations of
the x-dependent hadronic structure can be found in the
following review articles [49–51]. Recently, an attempt to
incorporate lattice QCD determination of PDFs together
with experimental data to obtain the non-singlet quark
distribution of the nucleon has been discussed in [52].
Lattice calculations of the pion valence PDFs have
been recently performed in Refs. [44, 47, 53] using the
quasi-PDF [47, 53] and the good lattice cross sections [44]
approaches. In this paper, we present the first lattice
calculation of the pion valence PDF using the approach
based on reduced Ioffe-time pseudo-distributions [34].
We discuss the limitations of our lattice QCD calculation of the pion valence quark distribution and compare
our results with those in Refs. [44, 47, 53] and also those
obtained from global fits as mentioned above.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
In Section II, we briefly discuss the reduced Ioffe time
pseudo-distributions approach and the necessity of the
calculation in coordinate space. In Section III, we present
numerical details of the calculation of hadronic matrix elements of the reduced Ioffe time pseudo-distribution to
extract the pion valence quark distribution. We present
the results of the extracted pion valence quark distribution in Section V and compare our result with different
fits of the experimental data and other lattice calculations in Section VI. Finally, we summarize our results
and outline the future directions of this method to obtain the pion valence quark distribution with controlled
systematics.
II. BASICS OF THE IOFFE TIME
PSEUDO-DISTRIBUTIONS APPROACH

The unpolarized quark non-singlet PDF is defined as
a Fourier transform of the nonlocal matrix element
M α (p, z) ≡ hp| ψ̄(0)γ α W(z; 0)ψ(z) |pi

(1)

taken on the light cone, e.g. for z = (z+ = 0, z− , 0⊥ ),
with the momentum given by p = (p+ , p− = m2 /2p+ , 0⊥ )
and α = +, where we use the light-cone coordinates,
3
x± = x0√±x
. The combination ν = p · z is called the Ioffe
2
time [54], and W(z; 0) is the gauge link in the fundamental representation. Its path goes along a straight-line
0 → z. For general z, p and α, the Lorentz decomposition of this matrix element can be written as
M α (p, z) = 2pα M(ν, z 2 ) + 2z α N (ν, z 2 ) .

(2)

When z = z− and α = +, the second function N (ν, z 2 )
does not contribute, i.e. the twist-2 PDF is solely determined by the first function. On the lattice, we need to

take a spacelike z. Choosing z = z3 and p = (E, 0⊥ , p3 , )
we can exclude the N (ν, z 2 ) function and deal with the
function M(ν, z 2 ) that is called the Ioffe time pseudodistribution (pseudo-ITD). The term “pseudo” [34] reflects the fact that one deals with the matrix element off
the light-cone, i.e., for nonzero z 2 . Another advantage of
taking the time component of M α (p, z) on the lattice is
that such a choice also avoids the pitfall of renormalization constant mixing as described in Ref. [55].
Choosing a spacelike separation z brings in a serious complication of additional link-related ultraviolet
(UV) divergences [56] that are absent when z is on the
light cone. Fortunately, these divergences are multiplicatively renormalizable [57–59], i.e. form an overall factor Z(z 2 /a2 ), where a is a UV regulator, such as the
lattice spacing. In the quasi-PDF approach, such divergences are usually removed using various versions of the
RI/MOM method [60, 62].
A different approach was proposed in [34]. One considers the reduced pseudo-ITD
M(ν, z 2 ) =

M(ν, z 2 )
,
M(0, z 2 )

(3)

formed by the ratio of M(ν, z 2 ) to its rest-frame pz = 0
value M(0, z 2 ). Since the UV factor Z(z 2 /a2 ) does not
depend on ν, it disappears from the ratio M(ν, z 2 ). As a
result, the latter is UV-finite. Moreover, it is a renormalization group invariant quantity. Also, taking the ratio
(3) removes not only the UV-divergences, but also the
part of the z 2 -dependence associated with them.
Beside UV divergences, there are other sources of the
z 2 -dependence. In particular, the function M(ν, z 2 ) contains higher-twist contributions related to the transversemomentum distributions of quarks inside a hadron and
reflected in the z 2 -dependence of M(ν, z 2 ). For small z 2 ,
they appear as higher twist contributions that are polynomial in O(z 2 Λ2QCD ). Thus, one may expect that for
small enough z 2 they may be neglected, and M(ν, z 2 )
may be related to the light-cone Ioffe time distribution [63] (ITD) Q(ν, µ2 ). Such a relation is given by a
factorization formula that involves just logarithmic ln(z 2 )
dependence accompanied by a perturbatively calculable
kernel.
An alternative proposal of taking such a ratio similar to
that in Eq. (3) has been proposed in [61]. In that article,
the authors claim that a vacuum matrix element of the
same type of operator could be used in the denominator,
instead of the rest frame hadron matrix element.
Furthermore, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the
higher-twist z 2 -dependence of M(ν, z 2 ) and M(0, z 2 ) is
similar, and the higher-twist impact on the ratio M(ν, z 2 )
is much weaker than M(ν, z 2 ). In particular, if M(ν, z 2 )
factorizes like M(ν, z 2 ) = M(ν)B(z 2 ), the ratio M(ν, z 2 )
has no z 2 -dependence. Unfortunately this idealized scenario is not true for QCD, but as was shown in [64],
taking the ratio will always reduce the higher twist contribution, in the limit ν → 0. An actual calculation [38],

3
though performed in the quenched approximation, produced an almost z 2 -independent result for M(ν, z 2 ) in
the region z > 4a (i.e., in the region where one would
expect higher twist effects to be significant), and a logarithmic ln(z 2 ) dependence in the region z ≤ 4a, where
it was perfectly described by the DGLAP (DokshitzerGribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi) [65–67] evolution.
Summarizing, the choice of M(ν, z 2 ) as the basic object for lattice studies of parton distribution functions
satisfies the following criteria:
1 Due to Lorentz invariance, the pseudo-ITD
M(ν, z 2 ) and, hence the reduced pseudo-ITD M(ν, z 2 )
depend only on the interval z 2 for a spacelike separation
z between the quarks and the Ioffe time ν. Both z 2 and
ν are Lorentz-invariant.
2 For all values of spacelike z 2 and for any contribut-

ing Feynman diagram, it can be shown [34] that the
Fourier transform of M(ν, z 2 ) and, hence M(ν, z 2 )) with
respect to ν has canonical support −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 in the
variable x interpreted as the standard momentum fraction.
3 The UV divergences associated with the gauge link
are canceled in the reduced ITD, and the latter is a renormalization group invariant quantity.
4 The short-distance behavior due to ln(z32 M 2 ) terms

(where M is an infrared regulator and z = z3 ) present
in M(ν, z32 ) and generating the perturbative evolution of
parton densities is preserved in M(ν, z32 ). In the z32 → 0
limit, the reduced pseudo-ITD maps to the usual lightcone PDF and obeys the familiar perturbative DGLAP
evolution with 1/z 2 serving as an evolution parameter.
To get the matching condition between M(ν, z32 ) and
the light-cone ITD Q(ν, µ2 ), one may use the operator
product expansion (OPE) which is valid both for the
numerator M(ν, z32 ) and the denominator M(0, z32 ). As
discussed, the UV-singular factors present in these functions cancel together with the z32 -dependence associated
with them. The remaining z32 -dependence corresponds to
the DGLAP logarithms ln(z32 M 2 ) and higher twist effects
proportional to z32 .
In our particular case, we have an additional simplification that, in the local limit, the operator in Eq.(2) is a
conserved vector current. As a result, the denominator
does not bring an extra ln(z32 M 2 )-dependence. Eventually, M(ν, z32 ) is matched to the MS light-cone ITD by
Z 1
M(ν, z 2 ) =
du C(u, µ2 z 2 )Q(uν, µ) + O(z 2 Λ2QCD ),
0

(4)
where Q(ν, µ) is the light-cone ITD whose Fourier transform with respect to ν gives the PDF f (x, µ) at a factorization scale µ. The matching kernel C(u, µ2 z 2 ) of the
reduced pseudo-ITD to the MS ITD has been determined
from one-loop calculations [59, 68–70]

The inverse of this formula will be needed for converting
the lattice results for M(ν, z 2 ) to the MS ITD Q(ν, µ) at
a matching scale µ. Without loss of accuracy, this can be
done by switching the reduced pseudo-ITD and the ITD
and by changing the sign of αs .
III.

NUMERICAL METHODS

The pion reduced pseudo-ITD is calculated on two
lattice QCD ensembles with different physical volumes.
These configurations were generated by the JLab/W&M
collaboration [71] using 2+1 flavors of stout smeared
clover Wilson fermions and a tree-level tadpole-improved
Symanzik gauge action. The strange quark
mass was set

2

by requiring the ratio 2MK
+ − Mπ + /MΩ− to assume
its physical value.
The fermion action includes one iteration of stout
smearing with the weight for the staples given by
ρ = 0.125. This smearing procedure has the consequence
that the tadpole corrected tree-level clover coefficient,
cSW = 1.2493, is very close to the non-pertubative
value determined a posteriori with the Schrödinger functional method [71]. The ensemble parameters are listed
in Table I. The lattice spacing of these ensembles,
a = 0.127 fm, was determined using the Wilson flow scale
w0 [72].
To ameliorate the contamination of excited states and
improve the overlap of the interpolators onto boosted pions, we implement a combination of the Gaussian smearing [73] and momentum-smearing [74] techniques. The
pseudo-ITD matrix elements are calculated using the
summation method. By now, this method is well known
in the lattice community. For completeness, some key
points of the method are highlighted below. We refer the
readers to [38, 75–77] for more details on the implementation of this method.
The summation method is related to the FeynmanHellmann theorem. One considers a theory where the
action is modified by the operator of interest
Z
Sλ (x) = SQCD (x) + λ d4 xO(x) .
(8)
By the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, a hadron matrix element of that operator can be found from a derivative of

As was shown in [75], the derivative of the effective
mass can be shown to be a ratio of correlation functions. This method has an advantage over other methods
based around the Feynman-Hellmann method, which require generation of specialized configurations which scan
λ. The derivative of the effective mass at λ = 0 can
be calculated using standard gauge configurations with
λ = 0.
The two-point and three-point correlation functions for
a fixed pion momentum p and a fixed current insertiontime t are written in terms of the standard pion interpolation field OΠ
C2 (T ) = hOΠ (T )ŌΠ (0)i
C3 (z, T ) = hOΠ (T )OΓ (z)ŌΠ (0)i

(10)
(11)

where T is the Euclidean time separation between the
interpolating operators for the pion creation and annihilation operators, OΓ (z) = ψ(0)ΓW(0; z)ψ(z), and we
use Γ = γ4 . For a fixed z, summing over the current insertion time t, the matrix element is estimated from the
large Euclidean time limit of the effective matrix element
M eff (T ) = R(T + 1) − R(T ) ,

The leading excited-state effects can be parameterized by

),

(14)

where ∆ is the energy gap between the ground state
and the lowest excited state. This method will also
have significantly reduced excited-state contamination at
large Euclidean separation compared to the typical ratio method, whose excited state contamination decays as
e−∆T /2 . These decreased excited-state effects allow for
particularly short time extents for matrix element extraction, as was demonstrated in [76].
For the summation method to be successful, many
source-to-sink separations are required. The common sequential source technique would require a large number
of propagator inversions for this to be practical. Instead,
this calculation shall use a sequential operator to construct three point correlation functions. The sequential

operator, H, is defined as the solution to the system of
equations, with suppressed spin and color indices
X
D(y, t; x, s)H(Oop ; x, s; x0 , t0 ) = Oop (y, t)G(y, t; x0 , t0 ),
x,s

where D(y, s; x, t) is the Dirac matrix and G(y, s; x0 , t0 )
is the point-to-all propagator from a randomly chosen
source point (x0 , t0 ). The three point correlation function is calculated by replacing a single propagator in a
standard two point function calculation with the sequential operator.
As mentioned earlier, this calculation utilizes the momentum smearing procedure [74] to improve the signal
of the moving states. Three values of the momentum
smearing parameter ζ are used, including 0. For each
of those momentum smearing parameters, two motifs of
smearing are used. The source interpolating field is always smeared, but the sink quarks will be either smeared,
called smeared-smeared (SS), or left as points, called
smeared-point (SP). Typically the SS correlation functions will have lower excited state contamination. On
the other hand, the SP correlation functions will typically have less statistical noise.
A fit of the data to Eq. (14) is used for each correlation function, holding the ground-state matrix element
and effective energy gap fixed between each correlation
function of the same p and z. Specifically, a fit is performed on N different effective bare matrix elements with
different smearing setups, Mjeff , to the form
2
Mjeff (p, z, T ) = M 0 (p, z)(1 + e−∆p T [A(j)
p (z )

+ Bp(j) (z 2 )T ])

(15)

with (2N + 2) fit parameters where j labels the N different smearings. The fit parameters will be chosen with a
weighted χ2 minimization which employs the full covariance matrix. The different momentum smearing parameters only improve the signal-to-noise ratio for a certain
range of momenta states and decreases the signal-to-noise
ratio for other momenta. The T range as well as which of
these correlation functions are used in the fit are varied
to minimize the χ2 per degree of freedom (χ2 /d.o.f.). All
statistical errors for the correlation functions and matrix
elements are estimated using the jackknife resampling
technique. Examples of these fits for the pion matrix
elements are plotted in FIGs. 2a and 1b.

5
exponential behavior will appear in matrix elements for
all momenta, but without the constant signal-to-noise ratio. The matrix elements for large distance become very
small and with the exponentially growing statistical error
at p 6= 0, they can be increasingly difficult to resolve.

Example fits of the bare Ioffe time pseudodistributions for the ensemble a127m415L. FIG. 2a corresponds to the matrix element with z = a and momentum
p = (2π)/(La) in the z-direction and denoted by pz = 1 in
the figure. For this fit the χ2 /d.o.f. is 1.17. FIG. 1b corresponds to the matrix element with z = 6a and momentum
p = 3(2π)/(La) in the z-direction and denoted by pz = 3 in
the figure. For this fit, χ2 /d.o.f. = 0.62. The color points correspond to different correlation functions for smeared-point
(SP) and smeared-smeared (SS) source and sink. Different
values of momentum smearing parameters are denoted by ζ.
The red band corresponds to the value of the matrix element
M 0 extracted from the fit.

The bare matrix elements for the rest frame are shown
in FIG 2. A unique feature of pion correlation functions at zero momentum is a constant signal-to-noise ratio in T allowing these matrix elements to be significantly
more precise than they would be for other hadrons. The
value of these matrix elements decays exponentially in
z/a. This feature is generated by the renormalization
of the Wilson line. In perturbation theory, this behavior appears as a power divergence for small z/a. This

In our calculation, the largest momentum along
the z-direction we use for both of the ensembles is
pmax = 3(2π/La). We use zmax = 6a (0.76 fm) and
8a (1 fm) for the a127m415 and a127m415L ensembles,
respectively. Even with these relatively large separations,
there does not appear a noticeable sign of higher twist
effects within the limitation of present statistics. Consequently, when calculating the moments of the PDF or of
the MS ITD, both of which can be calculated for each z
independently, there does not appear to be any significant dependence on the value of z used as will be demonstrated in the Section IV. If one attempts to determine
the PDF from the ITD using a limited set of data, i.e.
z ≤ 4a, or using the full set of data, then the results will
be consistent with each other but with larger variance
for the smaller set of data. This feature is particularly
apparent in the low-x region due to the shortened Ioffe
time extent of the ITD.
It is important to note that the size of potential
higher twist effects must be confirmed before trusting
results at any separation. As is frequently done, labeling higher twist effects as O(z 2 Λ2QCD ) for pseudo-ITDs
or O(Λ2QCD /p2z ) for quasi-PDFs only estimates the size
of these effects and the data must be checked for the
presence or lack of these effects before results can be
trusted. For the largest separation in this analysis, we
have z 2 Λ2QCD ∼ 1, but the reduced pseudo-ITD appears
to have successfully removed the higher twist effects in

6
this range of Ioffe time.
The reduced-ITDs for both ensembles before any perturbative matching are shown in FIG. 3. One can see that
the most data group around some ν-dependent curve,
with a rather small scatter. Excluded from this pattern
are the pz = 3 data points on the a127m415 ensemble,
which are visibly outside from the other data points that
follow a somewhat regular distribution in ν in FIG. 3.
It is worth noting that while pz = 3 corresponds to
a momentum of ∼ 0.91 GeV in physical units on the
a127m415L ensemble, it corresponds to a momentum of
∼ 1.22 GeV on the a127m415 ensemble with smaller volume. In fact, these data points are still within less than
∼ 2σ away of the other data points, and their inclusion
does not affect the subsequent result of the fit to extract
the pion valence PDF.

FIG. 3. Real component of the reduced pseudo-ITD obtained
from ensembles a127m415 and a127m415L for zmax = 6a and
8a, respectively. The largest momentum used for both the
ensembles is pmax = 3(2π/La). The triangle-up (4) symbols
indicate the reduced pseudo-ITD matrix elements M(ν, z 2 )
extracted from the a127m415 ensemble and the hexagon (7)
symbols denote those for the a127m415L ensemble. These
data points represent the reduced pseudo-ITD before any perturbative matching is performed.

IV.

MOMENTS OF THE PION PDF

As was described in [64], the reduced pseudo-ITD can
be used to calculate the moments of the PDF. By comparing the Taylor expansions with respect to ν of Eq. (4),
one can derive a multiplicative relationship between the
moments of the pseudo-PDF, bn (z 2 ), and the moments
of the MS PDF, an (µ2 )
bn (z 2 ) = Cn (µ2 z 2 )an (µ2 ) + O(z 2 Λ2QCD )

(16)

where Cn are the Mellin moments of the matching kernel
C(u, µ2 z 2 ) with respect to u. To next-to-leading order

from the matching convolution and Fourier transforms
are incurred. In principle, this method, coined as “OPE
without OPE” [78], can be used to determine any moment of the PDF in sharp contrast to the traditional
method which is based on local matrix elements. The
latter is limited by the appearance of power divergent
mixing due to the reduced rotational symmetry of the
lattice as well as issues related to the signal-to-noise ratio. In practice, however, only the lower moments will
have a resolvable signal. Larger Ioffe time extents and a
finer resolution in Ioffe time, both of which require finer
lattice spacings, are necessary before higher moments can
be obtained.
The lowest four moments will be extracted from the
a127m415L ensemble data by inverting the Vandermonde
matrix as was performed in [64, 77]. The imaginary and
real components are used individually to calculate the
odd and even moments respectively. The imaginary component of the reduced pseudo-ITD obtained from the
a127m415L ensemble is shown in FIG. 4. Due to the
larger uncertainty of the pz = 3 data points from the
a127m415 ensemble and the deviation from the Ioffe time
distribution of the other data points as shown in FIG. 3,
this ensemble does not allow us to extract moments in
a reliable way. Therefore, we extract moments using the
real and imaginary components of the reduced-ITD only
from the a127m415L ensemble in what follows.
The results for these moments, determined from data
with different z independently, are shown in FIGs. 5, 6, 7,
and 8, each one called “pseudo-PDF moment” before
matching and “PDF moment” after matching. For the
matching relationships, we choose µ = 2 GeV, and the
value of αs (2 GeV) = 0.303. This value of the coupling is
taken from the evolution used by the LHAPDF [79] for
the dataset cj15nlo from the CTEQ-Jefferson Lab collaboration [80]. The imaginary component of the pseudo-

FIG. 4. Imaginary component of the reduced pseudo-ITD
obtained from the ensemble a127m415L for zmax = 8a. The
largest momentum is pmax = 3(2π/La).

ITD calculated with the lowest two z-values has a completely linear behavior within their short Ioffe time range.
This leads to an inaccurate determination of the third
moment, which also slightly affected the calculation of
the first moment. The first moment for these two separations is instead calculated with a linear fit. Similarly,
the real component of the reduced pseudo-ITD calculated
with the lowest three z-values only exhibits a quadratic
behavior and has an ill-constrained value for the fourth
moment. In this case, those results did not appear to affect the quality of the second moment determination, so
the results are kept for the second moment. For the third
and fourth moments, these poorly constrained results are
dropped from the following analysis.
After the matching procedure in Eq. (16) has been applied, there is no significant large-z dependence on the
separation z from which the data originated for the second, third, and fourth moments. On the other hand, a
z 2 -dependence does appear for the first moment calculation, particularly between the z = 1a and 1a < z ≤ 8a
calculations. This moment at z = 1a point is the most
sensitive to the lattice spacing errors. In addition, this
point was determined with a simple linear fit and therefore it can be affected by different systematics.
For the first moment the residual z-dependence at
larger (z/a)2 , which may be due to higher twist effects
can be modeled. These effects are either polynomial
2γE +1
(i.e. z 2n ) or of the form z 2n ln(z 2 µ2 e 4 ). The logarithmic terms arise from logarithms in the matching coefficients Cn (z 2 µ2 ) when applied to pseudo-PDF moments
that contain higher twist effects. As we can see these
terms are suppressed by αs and they are expected to be
smaller than the simple polynomial terms. Due to its
large potential discretization errors, the z = a datapoint
is neglected in this fit. The moments are fit to four dif-

error introduced by these higher twist effects would be
comparable to, or smaller than, the other systematic errors of finite lattice spacing and unphysical pion mass. If
there had appeared a sufficiently strong polynomial z 2 behavior in enough moments, one could use the inverse
Mellin transform of that behavior to estimate the higher
twist effects in the reduced pseudo-ITD. With only four
moments and only one of them showing any discernible
higher twist effects, this inverse transform will not be
reliable. This lack of large higher twist effects in the moments, even with separations as large as z = 8a, justifies
the use of this data for extracting the PDF.
We summarize our calculation of the moments of the
pion PDF in Table III. For the moments which do not
show signs of higher twist effects, we take a covariance
weighted average of the results for each separation. For
the first moment, we state the value from the fit alatt

large values of the variance of the fit parameters, a small

calculations [81–87] of such moments for a comparison
with the calculated moments in this work.
We shall calculate the moments from the extracted
pion valence PDF, in the next section, and compare with
those obtained from in the NLO QCD analysis [14] from
the Fermilab E-615 pionic Drell-Yan data [9] at a scale of
5.2 GeV. Note that the odd moments listed in Table III,
which are extracted from the imaginary component of
the reduced pseudo-ITD, are related to qv (x) + 2q̄(x) distribution as shown in Ref. [38]. Therefore, our results for
the odd moments are not directly comparable with that
calculation.

V.

EXTRACTION OF THE PION VALENCE
DISTRIBUTION

It can be seen from FIG. 3 that the z 2 -dependence indeed cancels out to a great extent in the reduced pseudoITD of Eq. (3) without spoiling the ν-dependence in the
Ioffe time distribution which governs the shape of the
pion PDF. As discussed earlier, for small z 2 the function M(ν, z 2 ) should contain ln(z 2 ) singularities related
to the perturbative evolution of the PDFs. Such a logarithmic z 2 -dependence is clearly seen in the z ≤ 4a data
of Ref. [38, 39], performed in the quenched approximation, though at a finer lattice spacing a ' 0.093 fm. For
large z ≥ 6a values, they found the data in practice did
not depend on z. Thus, one can explicitly identify the
region z ≤ 4a, where one may rely on the perturbative
evolution. As demonstrated in [69], the matching procedure applied in this region to the points for M(ν, z 2 ) converts their ln(z 2 )-dependence into the ln(µ2 )-dependence
of the MS light-cone ITDs Q(ν, µ) on the MS scheme
subtraction parameter µ2 . Just like in Ref. [77], for the
matching of the reduced pseudo-ITD to the MS ITD at
a particular scale µ, we perform an inversion of Eq. (5)
simply by switching Q(ν, µ) and M(ν, z 2 ) and changing
the sign of αs . This gives

(20)
In other words, applying the matching procedure for an
appropriate value of αs , the z 2 -dependence of the original
small-z 2 data for M(ν, z 2 ) should be compensated by the
ln z 2 term, and one should get practically z 2 -independent
data points for Q(ν, µ).
In the present calculation, due to significantly larger
uncertainties compared to those in [38], no systematic
logarithmic dependence of the data on z 2 is visible.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine what is the
length scale z0 below which one may rely on perturbative evolution of the reduced pseudo-ITD, and what is the
value of αs associated with this evolution. As guidance
for a particular choice of αs one may use the idea that using the correct choice of αs in the matching formula (20)
should produce the least scatter for the small-z 2 points
from a universal curve in ν, at least up to discretization
effects.
The convolution is performed on a polynomial fit of
the data for M(uν, z 2 ), and Eq. (20) is applied for each
z independently. We choose µ = 2 GeV, and the value
of αs (2 GeV) = 0.303 has been taken form the evolution used in Ref. [79] as mentioned earlier. It important
to note that, in the reduced-ITD approach, the relevant
scale for converting the matrix element to the MS scheme
is the separation between the quark fields z 2 , not the
hadron’s momentum pz . To investigate the systematics
of the one-loop matching on our choice of αs at a particular scale, we vary αs by 10%, and estimate its effect as

extracted from the a127m415 ensemble and the diamond ()
symbols denote those for the a127m415L ensemble. The inner red uncertainty band is obtained from a simultaneous fit
to the matched ITDs at µ = 2.0 GeV on these two ensembles
in the limit of infinite volume. The outer red band is an estimate of the systematic uncertainty arising from the choice
of scales obtained through a simultaneous fit to the matched
ITDs in which the value of αs is varied by 10% about the
central value of αs = 0.303 at µ = 2 GeV.

correlated fit to these two data sets. The number of
configurations of the two ensembles we use are different.
Therefore, to perform a simultaneous fit of the matched
Ioffe time distributions, equal number of bootstrap samples are generated from the two ensembles. Because of
the reason mentioned earlier, we exclude the pz = 3
data from the a127m415 ensemble in this fit. Because
the functional form of the ITD Q(ν) is not known a
priori, we implement a “z-expansion” [88, 89] fit to the
data sets, reflecting the analyticity of Q(ν). We also investigate whether there is residual z 2 -dependence in the
matched Q(ν, µ) distribution. This is achieved by adding
z 2 -dependent terms in the fit function. Finally, a term
which describes a potential volume dependence is added.
There are no model calculations for the form of the finite volume corrections to the matrix element in Eq. (1),
unlike the two current matrix element [90]. Instead, we
take a simple exponential volume dependence where the
relevant distance is the difference between the lattice size
L and the length of the Wilson line z. Namely, we use
the following form

where
a source of systematic uncertainty, as shown in FIG. 10.
One can show that only the data points at large ν have as
large as 5% change in their central values, and are still
statistically consistent between different choices of αs .
Other points at low Ioffe time have less than 1% change
for the variation in αs = 0.303 ± 0.030. The small differences in the matched reduced-ITDs of the two ensembles originating from 10% change in αs are propagated as
systematic uncertainty in the subsequent analyses. The
matched ITDs for the two ensembles at the matching
scale of 2 GeV are shown in FIG. 10. The matched data
points in FIG. 10 are also seen to be located along a single
curve that is a function of ν, with rather small fluctuations. Again, the exceptions are the pz = 3 data points
from the a127m415 ensemble.
Having data from two ensembles that have different
volumes, one may wish to use them to study effects due
to finite volume. We do not see any finite volume effect in the reduced-ITDs with the exception of pz = 3
data obtained from the a127m415 ensemble which is not
trustworthy for the small volume. Moreover, the present
case of only two-volumes is not an ideal situation for
an infinite-volume extrapolation. In our particular case,
there are few pairs of data from the two ensembles that
correspond to the same Ioffe time ν.
To extract a single PDF combining the results from
the two ensembles, we will perform a simultaneous and

(22)

Note that, unlike the form factors we do not have
cuts in the complex plane for the calculated reduced
pseudo-ITD and we simply choose a dimensionless number νcut = 1.0 in Eq. (21). In fact, other choices are possible with the final results being unaffected.
One can readily see from Eq. (22) that, for fixed values of λk , a larger νcut dictates a slower fall-off of the
distribution. However, if one allows to vary λk in the fit
along with different choices of νcut , the fit parameters are
also changed accordingly such that the red band shown in
FIG. 10 remains unchanged. The value λ0 = 1.0 in the fit
is fixed by the normalization in Eq. (3) at ν = 0 and does
not change by the perturbative matching. We limit the
kmax in our fit to the value in which additional term in the
z-expansion has no effects on the fit and obtain kmax = 4.
The fit parameters are listed in Table IV. The smallness
of the fit parameters c1 and c2 reflect the fact that the
residual z 2 -dependence is negligible as discussed earlier.
The red band in FIG. 10 represents the ITD in the limit
of infinite volume and vanishing z 2 -contribution. The
outer red band indicates the systematic uncertainty in
the z-expansion fit of the reduced-ITD introduced by 10%
variation in αs at µ = 2.0 GeV.
We now use the Q(ν, µ = 2 GeV) ITD from the above
fit to extract the pion valence quark distribution. By

Therefore to convert Q(ν) into a function of x, one

discrete set of integer ν. Thus, the extraction of the PDF
using Eq. (24) from lattice calculated data constitutes an
ill-posed inverse problem. To our knowledge, a reliable
direct inverse Fourier transform to extract the PDF using
lattice QCD data is currently a formidable task.
An important constraint serving as additional information is that the valence distributions of the nucleon and
the pion are smooth functions of the momentum fraction

TABLE V. Comparison between the moments of the PDF extracted from the pion valence distribution in this work and

We use the numerical fitting program, ROOT [92] to
fit bootstrap samples of the matched pseudo-ITD to the

√
qvπ (x)-distribution. We find that the ρ x or the γx term
has no effect in the fit and we do not obtain any signal
of the fit parameters ρ and γ. Therefore we drop these
terms and adopt in our calculations the following simple
functional form for the PDF,
qvπ (x) =

xα (1 − x)β
,
B(α + 1, β + 1)
(28)

where the beta functions in the denominator ensure that
the normalization condition in Eq. (27) is met. We obtain
the fit parameters,
α = −0.48(14)stat (4)sys ,
β = 1.08(41)stat (11)sys ,

(29)

with the χ2 /d.o.f. about 1.9. For example, the inclusion of the γx term in the PDF fit yields the following
fit parameters and therefore the extracted PDF remains
essentially unchanged.
α = −0.49(14)stat (2)sys ,
β = 1.05(37)stat (2)sys ,
γ = 0.003(11)stat (57)sys .

(30)

In Eqs. (29) and (30), the number in the first uncertainty in the parentheses of the fit parameters are statistical uncertainties and the second is obtained from fitting
the matched Ioffe time distribution with the 10% variation in the the value of αs . We present the extracted
PDF qvπ (x) from this fit in FIG. 11a and the xqvπ (x)distribution in FIG. 11b. The fit to the data returns a
well-constrained value, α = −0.48(14), for the small-x
behavior of the PDF corresponding to the slope of the
relevant Regge trajectory. However, we stress that, with
the present resources of lattice QCD calculations, a precise and accurate determination of the low-x behavior of
the PDFs is not accessible. Specifically, one can argue
that the Fourier transform at the Ioffe time ν is related
to the region around the inverse of the Bjorken variable
xB , i.e. ν = 1/xB [33]. Therefore, to obtain a reliable
estimate of the low-x behavior of the PDFs, one requires
knowledge of the ITD at large ν. The PDF model parameters of the fit are highly correlated, as is evident
from FIGs. 11a and 11b . The uncertainty at x = 0.65
shrinks significantly due to the correlation between the fit
parameters. This feature of shrinking uncertainty at different x-values has also been observed in the calculation
of nucleon PDFs using pseudo-PDFs approach [77]. It is
a feature of these highly correlated fits to have regions
with small statistical errors.

For a comparison with the “OPE without OPE” calculation of the moments in Table III, we can take the Mellin
transformation of this PDF result described by the fit parameters in Eq. (29). At the scale of µ = 2 GeV, the first
four moments are hxi = 0.188(56), hx2 i = 0.081(29),
hx3 i = 0.046(19), and hx4 i = 0.030(14). Note that,
any discrepancy between these numbers and those in Table III may arise from a number of different reasons.
Firstly, the odd moments quoted in Table III contain
small contribution from the antiquarks. Secondly, the
data set used in the PDF extraction includes data from
both ensembles while those in Table III only include data
from the a127m415L ensemble. We also present a comparison between the moments extracted from our pion
valence PDF fit with those extracted in the NLO QCD
analysis [14] using the Fermilab experimental data [9] at
a scale of 5.2 GeV in the Table V. We note that, this lattice QCD calculation is performed at an unphysical pion
mass of mπ ∼ 415 MeV. A proper comparison with the
QCD analysis of the experimental data and lattice QCD
calculation can be made when a continuum and infinite
volume extrapolation to the lattice data near the physical
pion mass is performed.

and FIG. 11b shows the xqvπ (x)-distribution. The initial scale
for evolving the PDF to a higher scale is µ = 2 GeV, as
described in Section VI. For the fits of PDFs, we use the covariance matrix obtained from the z-expansion fit to generate
bootstrap samples in the Ioffe-time range of 0 < ν < 4.71
for which lattice QCD data points exist. We do not perform
any extrapolation to the data points outside this region of
the Ioffe-time using the results of the z-expansion. We have
checked that there is no dependence on the number of bootstrap samples in our fit. The statistical uncertainty band is
obtained from the fits to the bootstrap samples of the data.
The inner red band is obtained from a simultaneous fit to the
matched ITDs at µ = 2.0 GeV on these two ensembles in the
limit of infinite volume. The outer red uncertainty band in
the extraction of PDFs is obtained as a source of systematic
uncertainty by calculating the difference between the simultaneous fit to the matched ITDs for αs = 0.303 ± 0.030.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER
DETERMINATIONS

This lattice QCD calculation using the pseudo-ITD
approach is performed at a relatively heavy pion mass
(mπ ' 415 MeV) and on a relatively coarse lattice spacing of a = 0.127 fm. Repeating similar calculations
on several other lattice ensembles to determine the pion
mass dependence, quantify the severity of discretization
errors and provide a more precise estimation of the effect
of finite volume in order to obtain the pion valence PDF
in the continuum limit is under way. However, with the
present calculation, we proceed with a qualitative comparison of various global fits of the pion PDFs and three
previous lattice QCD determinations.
For a comparison with qvπ (x) determined from the
Drell-Yan experimental data in Ref. [9], we evolve
our determination of the pion PDF to an evolution
scale of µ2 = 27 GeV2 starting from an initial scale of
µ20 = 4 GeV2 as shown in FIGs. 11a and 11b. As expected, the evolution to a higher scale shifts the peak of
the xqvπ (x)-distribution toward smaller values of x and a
more convex-up behavior of the distribution as x → 1 is
seen compared to the xqvπ (x) at the initial scale of our
calculation.
We see a quantitative agreement of our extracted pion
PDF with the NLO global fits in [14, 16] to the DrellYan experimental data in [9] in the x & 0.7 momentum
fraction region as presented in FIG. 12. It should be
noted that our determination of qvπ (x) has a distinctive
deviation from the predictions of QCD-based hard-gluonexchange perturbative models [17–19], which predicts a
faster (1 − x)2 fall-off of the pion PDF at large x. Such

a (1 − x)2 fall-off at large x was also obtained in the
experimental data analysis in Ref. [15], where the authors
included next-to-leading-logarithmic threshold soft-gluon
re-summation effects in the calculation of the Drell-Yan
cross section. A good way to visualize the discrepancy

lattice QCD calculation of qvπ (x) is evolved from an initial
scale µ2 = 4 GeV2 at NLO. All the results are at evolved to an
evolution scale of µ2 = 27 GeV2 . The outer red uncertainty
band shown in the qvπ (x)-distribution is obtained from the
variation in the choice of αs during the one-loop perturbative
matching as described in Section V.

in the large-x region between the pion PDF extracted in
our calculation with the experimental data and various
global fits can be demonstrated by plotting xqvπ (x) as a
function of x. We present such a plot in FIG. 13.
We now compare the determination of the pion valence quark PDF presented in this paper with the previous three lattice QCD determinations using the quasiPDF approach [47, 53] and the lattice cross sections approach [44].
In [47], a careful and systematic investigation was performed. In that paper, the matrix element was renormalized using the RI/MOM inspired approach [60, 62],
in which the hadron matrix element is divided by a quark
matrix element of the same operator. Thus, just like in
the reduced pseudo-ITD method, one deals with a ratio
of the original matrix element and another matrix element that has the same ultraviolet divergences.
However, the nonperturbative z 2 -behavior of the denominator factor in these two approaches is different.
In particular, according to the analysis in Ref. [47],
the RI/MOM factor ZRI/MOM (z) in the z & 0.5 fm
region shows a formation of a constituent quark mass
mscr ∼ 300 MeV leading to a suppression of ZRI/MOM (z)
by an extra e−mscr |z| factor.

FIG. 13. Comparison of the pion xqvπ (x)-distribution with
the LO extraction from Drell-Yan data [9] (gray data points
with uncertainties), NLO fits [14–16] (green band, maroon
curve, and blue band). This lattice QCD calculation of qvπ (x)
is evolved from an initial scale µ20 = 4 GeV2 at NLO. All the
results are evolved to an evolution scale of µ2 = 27 GeV2 . The
outer red band shown in the qvπ (x)-distribution is obtained
from the variation in the choice of αs during the one-loop
perturbative matching as described in Section V and by calculating the variation in the fitting of the matched Ioffe-time
data using the PDFs parametrization in Eq. (28).

The pion rest-frame matrix element M(0, z 2 ) used in
our calculation has a much faster decrease with |z| than
ZRI/MOM (z) of Ref. [47]. Numerically, it is very close to
the nucleon rest-frame matrix element of Ref. [77]. As
argued in Ref. [34], the fast fall-off of M(0, z 2 ) reflects
the finite size of the relevant hadron, i.e. the nonperturbative effects related to quark confinement. In the OPE
language, the associated z 2 -dependence corresponds to
higher-twist contributions. As pointed out in Section II,
one of the aims of using the reduced ITD is to cancel
unwanted higher twist effects.
We note that the use of the reduced ITD corresponds to a gauge-invariant renormalization prescription
that avoids the pathological systematics of fixed gauge
renormalization. In fact, previous calculations of quasiPDFs [53, 93] have shown slight discrepancies which depend on the renormalization scheme used for the matrix
element and intermediate schemes used in the matching
relationships. The systematic errors introduced by these
choices can be avoided by calculating a renormalization
group invariant quantity M(ν, z 2 ) and then matching it
to the MS PDF.
Another difference among the different lattice calculations is the treatment of the inverse problem. Our
point is that inverse problems can only be solved by
adding additional information. The quasi-PDF calculation in [47] adds this information in a way analogous
to the present calculation and the lattice cross sections
calculation in [44]. The main idea is to parameterize

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In this paper, we have presented the first lattice QCD
calculation of the pion valence distribution using the Ioffe
time pseudo distributions approach. In our calculation,
we have used combined results from two different ensembles, with the same lattice spacing a = 0.127 fm, but with
different lattice sizes of 243 × 64 and 323 × 96. We have
also performed the first lattice QCD calculation of the
fourth moment of the pion PDF, which was previously
inaccessible from local matrix elements.

the PDF in terms of a few model dependent parameters
and then fit the position-space matrix element using that
functional form.
The quasi-PDF calculation performed in Ref. [53] instead attempts to directly perform the inverse Fourier
transform. To remove unphysical oscillations caused by
the ill-posed inverse, they use a “derivative method” [94].
As was shown in [64], the “derivative method” does not
alleviate the ill-posed inverse problem especially with
such short Ioffe time ranges, as only a few nonzero points
exist in that quasi-PDF calculation [53].
Of notable interest, our calculation of xqvπ (x), shown
in FIGs. 11 and 13, illustrates a peak of the distribution in a region x < 0.40. This is consistent with all the
global analyses of the pion valence distribution, wherein
xqvπ (x) is peaked below x = 0.40. This feature also occurs in the lattice cross sections calculation in [44] and
the quasi-PDF calculation in [47]. On the other hand,
the quasi-PDF calculation using the derivative method
performed in [53] peaks at a somewhat larger value of
around x = 0.50.
In comparison with the determination of qvπ (x) in
Ref. [44], which was performed on the same ensemble
as the larger of our lattices, we see the large-x behavior
of the distributions are in agreement within their uncertainties. In particular, qvπ (x) extracted in [44] gives
β = 1.93(68), and the value β = 1.08(41) is obtained
in the present calculation. We note, however, that the
choice of the initial scale of 1 GeV performed in Ref. [44]
was rather arbitrary because of the absence of the NLO
perturbative matching. The difference in qvπ (x) obtained
in these two calculations based on short-distance factorization remains to be investgated.
In FIG. 14, we present a comparison between the lattice QCD extractions of pion valence quark distribution made in Refs. [44, 47, 53] with our calculation that
uses the pseudo-ITD approach. For the calculation in
Ref. [44], the PDF is evolved to µ = 4 GeV assuming an
initial scale of 2 GeV in FIG. 14. The PDF in Ref. [47]
is calculated using pion momentum pz = 1.29 GeV, the
RI/MOM scale is fixed at 1.93 GeV and the PDF is estimated at µ = 3.2 GeV. To illustrate the difference between all the calculations in the x & 0.4 region, we also
present the xqvπ (x) distributions from these lattice calculations in FIG. 14b.

FIG. 14. Comparison of the pion valence qvπ (x) and xqvπ (x)distributions estimated near µ = 4 GeV scale using quasiPDFs in Refs. [47, 53], good lattice cross sections in Ref. [44]
with the pseudo-ITD approach in this calculation.

We have performed the one-loop perturbative matching of the pseudo-ITDs to light-cone ITDs at the scale
µ = 2 GeV. Then we have combined the pseudodistributions from the two ensembles using a modelindependent scheme.
To extract the pion valence quark distribution, we have
assumed a functional form motivated by those used in
phenomenological global fits of parton distribution functions, and obtained the parameters of this form using
our data for the matched light-cone ITD. This approach
allows us to avoid solving the ill-posed problem of the inverse Fourier transform from the ITD to PDF. We made a
qualitative comparison between our lattice QCD extraction of the pion valence quark distribution with those
obtained from global fits and previous lattice QCD calculations.

15
It should be noted that, in our lattice calculation, the
region z . 0.5 fm where one can rely on the perturbative
matching corresponds just to 4 lattice separations at this
lattice spacing. Therefore, a calculation with finer lattice
spacing is warranted and is the goal of future efforts. On
the other hand, our analysis (even keeping in mind the
limitations of the present statistics) shows no evidence
for higher twist effects in the reduced pseudo-ITD up to
z = 1 fm, which we took as a justification to use the
data for extracting the PDF up to z = 8a on the larger
ensemble.
A natural extension of our investigation would be a calculation on several other ensembles with different pion
masses, lattice spacings, and volumes. We expect that
the results of such upgraded lattice QCD calculations will
eventually become important additional input in global
analyses to obtain a precise knowledge of the large-x behavior of the pion valence quark distribution.
