ABSTRACT
We report circular polarization measurements from the first two years of observation with the 40 GHz
polarimeter of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS). CLASS is conducting a multifrequency survey covering 75% of the sky from the Atacama Desert designed to measure the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) linear E and B polarization on angular scales 1◦ . θ ≤ 90◦ , corresponding to a multipole range of 2 ≤ ` . 200. The modulation technology enabling measurements of linear
polarization at the largest angular scales from the ground, the Variable-delay Polarization Modulator,
is uniquely designed to provide explicit sensitivity to circular polarization (Stokes V ). We present a
first detection of circularly polarized atmospheric emission at 40 GHz that is well described by a dipole
with an amplitude of 124 ± 4 µK when observed at an elevation of 45◦ , and discuss its potential impact
as a foreground to CMB experiments. Filtering the atmospheric component, CLASS places a 95%
C.L. upper limit of 0.4 µK2 to 13.5 µK2 on `(` + 1)C`V V /(2π) between 1 ≤ ` ≤ 120, representing a
two-orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous limits.

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy,
in intensity and linear polarization, has added excellent constraining power to modern cosmological models (Netterfield et al. 2002; Kovac et al. 2002; Bennett
et al. 2013; Planck Collaboration et al. 2018; Louis et
al. 2017; Henning et al. 2018). Standard cosmology
and the ΛCDM model predict no significant primordial
circular polarization, yet constraints on this prediction
are sparse. Theoretical work has produced a variety of
predictions of circularly polarized emission mechanisms.
Synchrotron emission in galaxies is intrinsically elliptically polarized (Legg & Westfold 1968). Magnetized
relativistic plasma in supernovae remnants of Population III stars (De & Tashiro 2015) and in galaxy clusters (Cooray et al. 2003) can convert E-mode polarization into circular polarization through Faraday conversion. Primordial magnetic fields can generate circular
polarization in the CMB (Giovannini 2009, 2010; Zarei
et al. 2010). Circular polarization can also result from
coupling of the Chern-Simons term to electrodynamics
resulting in cosmic birefringence (Carroll et al. 1990).
Other mechanisms for the production of circularly polarized emission are discussed in Ejlli (2019), Mohammadi
(2013), Sawyer (2015), and Venumadhav et al. (2017),
with a review in King & Lubin (2016). All predictions
are still several orders-of-magnitude fainter than what
is accessible with the sensitivity levels of current experiments. The brightest predicted source of circularly polarized emission is the Zeeman transition in atmospheric
Oxygen (Keating et al. 1998; Hanany & Rosenkranz
2003).
Existing constraints on circular polarization from extraterrestrial sources, reported by the Spider balloonborne experiment (Nagy et al. 2017), are three-orders-ofmagnitude larger than current linear polarization measurements (BICEP2 Collaboration et al. 2018). The
Spider measurement leveraged nonidealities in its halfwave plate polarization modulators, which provide a
small amount of coupling to circular polarization, to produce an upper limit at 95 and 150 GHz.
The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor
(CLASS) is an array of four polarimetric telescopes situated in the Atacama Desert in Chile, operating at four
frequencies spanning the microwave foreground minimum and targeting the polarized CMB at the largest
angular scales (Eimer et al. 2012; Essinger-Hileman et al.
2014; Harrington et al. 2016). Making measurements of
the sky at these scales will provide powerful constraints
on the optical depth to the epoch of reionization (Watts

et al. 2018) and cosmological inflationary models (Watts
et al. 2015). The Variable-delay Polarization Modulator (VPM) technology employed by CLASS to access
the largest scales is unique in that it provides explicit
sensitivity to circular polarization (Section 2.1) (Chuss
et al. 2012; Harrington et al. 2018). CLASS has been
observing 75% of the sky with the 40 GHz instrument
since 2016, and the remaining frequencies of 90, 150, and
220 GHz have been deployed and are currently collecting data. We report on the circular polarization results
for the first two years of observation with the 40 GHz
instrument over 56% of the sky.
Section 2 describes the data selection and analysis,
including an explanation of the instrument’s coupling
to circular polarization. Section 3.1 reports on a first
detection of atmospheric emission at 40 GHz and discusses its implications for CMB measurements. Section
3.2 presents new upper limit constraints on circularly
polarized emission at 40 GHz.
2. DATA PROCESSING

2.1. Sensitivity to Circular Polarization
The CLASS front-end, fast modulation is provided
by a Variable-Delay Polarization Modulator described
in detail in Chuss et al. (2012), and Harrington et al.
(2018). The VPM consists of a stationary grid of parallel wires that reflects light polarized along one axis and
transmits light polarized along the other. The transmitted light reflects off a flat mirror behind the grid

3
and recombines with light reflected by the grid with an
optical path difference that depends on the grid-mirror
separation. The mirror is actuated to modulate the optical path difference at 10 Hz, moving the signal band to
higher frequencies that are less vulnerable to 1/f and
other low-frequency noise (Miller et al. 2016). During
one cycle of operation, the VPM switches the Stokes
parameter U for the incoming light into Stokes V , and
then into Stokes −U (Figure 1).
This explicit sensitivity to circular polarization is so
far unique to CMB experiments using Variable-delay Polarization Modulators such as CLASS (Harrington et al.
2016), and PIPER (Gandilo et al. 2017).
2.2. Mapmaking and Data Processing
The first era of CLASS observations ran from September 2016 through February 2018. During this period, the
40 GHz instrument collected data year-round at a rate
of 200 Hz with 64 polarization-sensitive bolometers (Appel et al. 2014, 2019). The telescope scans the sky by
performing 720◦ azimuth “sweeps” in alternating directions, at a constant rate of one degree per second, held at
an elevation of 45◦ . Each day the instrument observes
at one of seven different boresight orientations, which
range from −45◦ to +45◦ in increments of 15◦ . For this
analysis we select data from the best 239 days of observation based on their noise properties, representing
62% of the total data collected. We discard data from
detectors that performed poorly during the season, leaving a total of 57 bolometers. To identify and eliminate
contamination of the data, we compute the variance of
the timestream on windows of various lengths and apply cuts to regions with anomalous values. We apply
an additional cut when the distance between a detector
pointing and the Sun (Moon) is smaller than 20◦ (10◦ ).
The timestream calibration to thermal units is based on
observations of the Moon and described in Appel et al.
(2019). In the last pre-processing step we apply deconvolutions that correct for the readout filter (Battistelli
et al. 2008) and detector time constants.
The space between the grid and the mirror creates a
resonant cavity that produces a signal that is a function
of the grid-mirror separation, and the differential temperature and emissivity of the grid wires and the sky
(Miller et al. 2016). To remove this VPM-synchronous
signal we subtract a time-domain template created by
averaging the data in each sweep in bins of grid position,
as given by linear encoders on the VPM.
A model for the timestream data, d, obtained by multiplying the Mueller matrix of all elements in the optics
chain, is
d = I + MU U Q cos(2γ) + MU U U sin(2γ) + MU V V, (1)

where γ is the sum of the parallactic angle of the grid and
telescope boresight angle, and Mij for i, j ∈ {I, Q, U, V }
are the elements of the 4×4 VPM Mueller matrix (Miller
et al. 2016). These elements are a function of the gridmirror separation z, Mij = Mij (z). To produce a map,
we invert this timestream model using the traditional
linear least squares mapmaking equation
s = (AT N −1 A)−1 AT N −1 d,

(2)

where s is an Npixels ×NStokes vector representing the sky
maps of each Stokes parameter, A is the projection operator mapping the data between the time-domain and
the map-domain, and N is the noise covariance matrix
in the time basis. For this work, we employ a naive
mapmaking approach where we approximate N as a diagonal matrix with elements equal to the variance of the
time segment being mapped, equivalent to one sweep
of the telescope. To make this approximation valid for
the Stokes I component, we suppress the temperature
signal from the atmosphere, which has a 1/f spectrum
and is correlated between detectors. We do this by fitting an order 19 polynomial in the azimuth-domain to
each timestream and subtracting it. While this biases
the large-scale modes in the temperature maps, the fast
modulation shifts the linearly and circularly polarized
signals up in the frequency-domain to a band centered at
10 Hz, where their amplitudes are not attenuated by this
filtering. The recovered V map is nearly unbiased (Figure 2). We have extended the Ninkasi mapmaking code
written for the ACT experiment (Dünner et al. 2013)
to incorporate Equation 1. We use it to perform all
the data operations described in this section and to bin
the maps into a HealPix grid in equatorial coordinates
(Figure 3). In this analysis we consider only the Stokes
V maps. We use the temperature maps (Stokes I) for
calibration of the instrument (Appel et al. 2019). The
Stokes Q and U maps will serve as a consistency check
to the maps produced by the main linear polarization
analysis pipeline which employs a destriping mapmaker
(J. Eimer et al. (2019, in preparation)).
Before analyzing each map we discard the edges of the
observing region by only keeping pixels visited by every
detector, bringing the covered sky fraction to 56%. We
perform the analysis on the region of the sphere between
declinations of −60◦ S and 15◦ N. No galactic mask is
applied.
Since CLASS observes at fixed elevation, the circularly polarized atmospheric signal depends only on azimuth. With the telescope’s observing strategy, this
time-invariant azimuthal dependence implies a signal
in the maps that is approximately independent of right
ascension. To estimate the power spectrum of the ex-

4

The selected data set consists of 239 constant elevation scans (CES) with the 40 GHz telescope, each between 10 and 24 hours in duration. The average length
of one CES is 20 hours, yielding a total of 4772 hours of
observation including night and daytime data. We make
26 independent maps with the data distributed so that
each has full coverage of the observation region and similar amounts of integration time. When distributing the
data between the maps, we prioritize spatial coverage
and map weight over boresight rotation coverage, since,
unlike linear polarization, circular polarization measurements do not require observations at different telescope
boresight orientations.

From these maps we produce 26
2 = 325 cross-spectra
using the PolSpice estimator described in Chon et al.
(2004). We use ensembles of simulations of an isotropic
Gaussian random field with a flat spectrum to check
the robustness of the estimator given our sky mask.
These results are insensitive to other choices of continuous input spectrum. We use these simulations to verify that PolSpice returns unbiased bandpowers in bins
with width ∆` = 12 starting at ` = 1 for our choice
of sky mask. Based on these simulations, we choose to
forego the apodization of the correlation function. Since
V is a Spin-0 field, the treatment follows that of a temperature map.
When computing the power spectra, we weight each
map by the V V element of the naive pixel covariance
matrix, which is an estimate of the noise in each pixel
accounting for integration time and the modulation efficiency of the VPM in V . This map-domain weighting
accounts for the inhomogeneity of the noise in the maps
and reduces the variance across all bins by ∼15%.
To characterize the effects of the time- and mapdomain filtering, we process a simulation ensemble
through our pipeline. These simulations use the same
data selection, observing times, and filtering used to
make the data maps. The m-averaged filter transfer
function, F` , quantifying the amount of signal attenuated by the time- and map-domain filtering (described
in Section 2.2) is given by the mean of the ratios of the
power spectra of the filtered simulated maps to the input simulated maps. The uncertainty in each bin of the
transfer function is given by the spread of the distri-

section we describe how we estimate the power spectrum

as a function of multipole is given by the instrument’s
beam window function, B`2 . The beam window function
is based on observations of the Moon, and described
in detail in Z. Xu et al. (2019, in preparation). The
product of these two quantities is the power spectrum
window function, W` = F` B`2 , used to debias the measured bandpowers. We bin this window function in bins
with width ∆` = 12, the same as the data, to reduce
correlations between adjacent multipoles at low `.
Note from Figure 2 that the filtering attenuates at
most 14% of the power, in the lowest bin, which spans
1 ≤ ` ≤ 12.
3. RESULTS

We present a new upper limit to extraterrestrial circular polarization emission at 1 ≤ ` ≤ 120, and the
detection of circularly polarized atmospheric emission,
both at 40 GHz. The characteristics of the atmospheric
emission in particular are of interest to current and future ground-based experiments targeting high precision
polarization measurements at large angular scales.
We check for self-consistency of the maps with a permutation test. From the 26 maps we construct 13 difference maps by randomly drawing pair combinations.
We compute all possible cross-spectra from these maps
and average them to estimate the null spectrum, and

Figure 3. (Top) Stokes V map made from 239 days of
CLASS data. This map is coadded from the 26 maps used
in the cross-spectra analysis of Section 3.2. The gradientlike dipole structure visible in the map is caused by Zeeman
emission of atmospheric oxygen, which depends on the inner
product of the telescope’s boresight vector and the Earth’s
magnetic field vector. This creates a pattern that is approximately only a function of declination. (Bottom) Stokes V

then compute the p-value of this null spectrum from the
sample covariance matrix of all the cross-spectra. We repeat this operation 500 times. The distribution of these
500 p-values is uniformly distributed between zero and
one, indicating that all observed signal is common to all
maps. This rules out statistically significant amounts
of time-varying systematic errors that might affect the
maps unevenly. A more comprehensive analysis of systematic errors investigating other splits of the data is
left for future work.
3.1. Atmospheric Dipole
The main component seen in the maps is the polarized
atmospheric emission (Figure 3), caused by the Zeeman
transitions of oxygen in the atmosphere as predicted by

Figure 4. V V power spectrum at 40 GHz after suppression
of atmospheric component, binned into bins with ∆` = 12.
The data has a reduced-χ2 = 0.921. Monte Carlo simulations made with the sample bin-bin covariance matrix yield
a p-value of 0.54 for the data, indicating no statistically significant detection of power.

Keating et al. (1998), Hanany & Rosenkranz (2003), and
Spinelli et al. (2011). The Earth’s magnetic field causes
a splitting of the energy levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. Transitions between these energy levels are polarized, but have weak to no dependence on time-varying
environmental parameters such as precipitable water vapor, temperature, and atmospheric pressure.
In the 40 GHz V map the majority of the atmospheric
component is well modeled by a dipole with an amplitude of 124 ± 4 µK. This corresponds to a spherical
harmonic mode at (`, m) = (1, 0) with coefficient a`m
equal to a10 = 255 ± 8 µK. A detailed analysis of this
component, including physically motivated atmospheric
modeling, is discussed in M. Petroff et al. (2019, in
preparation).
With the contaminated declination-dependent modes
suppressed by the declination filter we are left with an
estimate of the circular polarization coming from the
extraterrestrial sky. We model the effects of the filter
statistically with Monte Carlo simulations to debias the
V V power spectrum, shown in Figure 4. A 95% C.L.
upper limit is constructed from this spectrum and is
shown in Figure 5.
The amplitude of the atmospheric emission is proportional to the inner product of the telescope’s line-of-sight
vector and the Earth’s magnetic field vector (Lenoir
1968). A map-domain declination filter that subtracts
the mean along each row of pixels, applied independently
to each map in the splits, suppresses the signal below

measurable levels (Figure 4). The declination-filtered
maps are used to estimate the power spectrum of the
extraterrestrial signal.
The effectiveness of the declination filter indicates the
detected atmospheric signal is confined to the small fraction of modes that are not a function of right ascension.
Discarding these modes corresponds to a loss of sensitivity of ∼1% at ` = 80, the location of the recombination peak in the B-mode spectrum (Figure 2). The
highly localized nature of the contaminated modes relaxes the tolerances for instrumental V→P leakage for
instruments targeting r . 0.01 from the ground.

from the sample covariance matrix.
From this power spectrum we produce an upper limit
per bin equal to the estimated bandpower value plus
a 95% confidence limit, shown in Figure 5. This upper
limit is a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement over the
previous limit at Ka band by the MIPOL experiment at
large scales (Mainini et al. 2013), and a two-orders-ofmagnitude improvement over the previously best CMB
upper limits by Spider (Nagy et al. 2017).
4. CONCLUSION

3.2. Upper Limit on Circular Polarization Emission
The error bars plotted in Figure 4 are the square root
of the diagonal elements of the bin-bin sample covariance matrix for all of these cross-spectra, divided by
the square root of the number of cross-spectra. Uncertainties from the filter transfer function and beam window function are propagated assuming Gaussianity of
the distributions in each bin. This assumption is valid
for all bins given the chosen binwidth. The data has a
reduced-χ2 = 0.921, which has a p-value of 0.54, indicating no statistically significant detection of power over

We present circular polarization results from the first
two years of observation with the CLASS 40 GHz instrument, consisting of a detection of atmospheric emission
and an upper limit on extraterrestrial emission in the
1 ≤ ` ≤ 120 range. The atmospheric signal, when measured at 45◦ elevation, has an amplitude of 124 ± 4 µK.
The circular polarization upper limit at 40 GHz ranges
from 0.4 µK2 to 13.5 µK2 (Figure 5), representing a
two-orders-of-magnitude better constraint on extraterrestrial circular polarization emission, and a five-ordersof-magnitude improvement at the largest scales.

CLASS telescopes covering three additional frequencies, 90, 150, and 220 GHz, are currently equipped with
VPMs and operating in the Atacama Desert in Chile.
These instruments will provide improved frequency coverage of circular polarization emission, which will help
characterize the atmospheric emission at frequencies
relevant to current and future CMB polarization experiments, and add considerable constraining power to
galactic, extragalactic, and cosmological sources of circularly polarized emission. Higher frequency CLASS
data currently being collected will improve the multipole coverage thanks to the increased resolution of the
higher frequency instruments.
