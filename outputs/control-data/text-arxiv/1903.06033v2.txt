Abstract
We give an algorithm and source code for a cryptoasset statistical arbitrage
alpha based on a mean-reversion effect driven by the leading momentum factor
in cryptoasset returns discussed in https://ssrn.com/abstract=3245641.
Using empirical data, we identify the cross-section of cryptoassets for which
this altcoin-Bitcoin arbitrage alpha is significant and discuss it in the context
of liquidity considerations as well as its implications for cryptoasset trading.

Introduction

There is a sizable proliferation of cryptoassets,4 whose number according to https:
//coinmarketcap.com was 2,116 as of January 18, 2019. Just as with stocks (and
other asset classes), there appear to be underlying common factors for cryptoasset
returns, at least on shorter-horizons [Kakushadze, 2018].5 Thus, the leading common
factor in the daily close-to-close cryptoasset returns is the prior day’s momentum
(“mom”), and on average the subsequent open-to-close return is negatively correlated with mom. So, there is a mean-reversion effect in daily cryptoasset returns.
Can we utilize this mean-reversion effect to construct a trading signal (alpha)?
The mean-reversion here is cross-sectional, so such an alpha would (ideally) involve
a sizable cross-section of cryptoassets. In the case of stocks one can construct a
dollar-neutral mean-reversion strategy by going long a sizable number of stocks
with the investment level IL and simultaneously shorting a sizable number of stocks
with the investment level IS , with IS = IL (so we have dollar-neutrality), which is a
standard long-short statistical arbitrage strategy. Alternatively, one can go long a
sizable number of stocks with the investment level IL and simultaneously short an
index futures with the investment level IS (again, IS = IL ), e.g., S&P 500 futures,
in which case we have a dollar-neutral so-called S&P 500 outperformance strategy.
We can attempt to do something similar with cryptoassets. However, shorting
a sizable number of cryptoassets is not practicable. We can short Bitcoin futures6
instead. The long position then can be in a sizable number of cryptoassets other
than Bitcoin, i.e., altcoins. We then have a Bitcoin outperformance strategy, which
we refer to as altcoin-Bitcoin arbitrage.7 So, the idea is simple. We maintain a short
Bitcoin position with the investment level IS (so we do not trade Bitcoin). The long
position consists of a cross-section of altcoins, which changes daily based on their
mom values, so we either establish or liquidate long altcoin positions, but never
short them. We discuss some simple trading rules for altcoin positions in Section 2.
The next question is whether the alpha is “tradable”. The main considerations
are transaction costs and liquidity. In this note we focus on liquidity considera4

For the purposes of this note, cryptoassets include digital cryptography-based assets such as
cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin), as well various other digital “coins” and “tokens” (minable as well
as non-minable), that have data on https://coinmarketcap.com.

tions. Does this alpha work across essentially all cryptoassets, or is its performance
correlated with their liquidity? We address this question empirically in Section 3.
We briefly conclude in Section 4. Appendix A gives R source code for building the
portfolio and backtesting it.8 Tables and figures summarize our backtesting results.

2.1

Setup and Data

Cryptoassets trade continuously, 24/7.9 Thus, “open” on any given day means the
price right after midnight (UTC time), while “close” on any given day means the
price right before midnight (UTC time), so the open on a given day is almost the
same as the close of the previous day. All prices (open, close, high, low), volume and
market cap are measured in dollars. The index i = 1, . . . , N labels N different cryptoassets cross-sectionally, while the index s = 0, 1, 2, . . . labels the dates, with s = 0
corresponding to the most recent date in the time series. So: PisC (or, equivalently,
C
) is the close price for the cryptoasset labeled by i on the day labeled by s; PisO
Pi,s
is the open price; PisH is the high price; PisL is the low price; Vis is the daily dollar
volume; Cis is the market cap.10 All our data was freely downloaded (see below).
We define daily open-to-close log-returns (or “continuously compounded” returns), which we use to define the mom factor as in [Kakushadze, 2018] (see below):

Ris = ln PisC /PisO
(1)
For small values it is approximately the same as the standard (“single-period”)
return defined as
eis = P C /P O − 1
R
(2)
is
is
eis .
For computing portfolio P&L, return, Sharpe ratio [Sharpe, 1994], etc., we use R

2.2

Momentum

There are various ways to define the momentum factor (mom). For our purposes
here, we will define it as in [Kakushadze, 2018]:
mom
βis
= Ri,s+1

(3)

mom
This definition is 100% out-of-sample: we use βis
for trading on the date labeled
mom
by s, and βis is computed using quantities from the prior date labeled by s + 1.

The source code given in Appendix A hereof is not written to be “fancy” or optimized for
speed or in any other way. Its sole purpose is to illustrate the algorithms described in the main
text in a simple-to-understand fashion. Some important legalese is relegated to Appendix B.

Assuming no special circumstances such as trading halts.
10
High, low and volume are measured between the open and the close of a given day.

2.3

Trading Signal

The trading signal (alpha) αis for altcoins is defined as follows:
mom
αis = θ (−βis
)

(4)

where the Heaviside function θ(x) = 1 if x > 0, and θ(x) = 0 if x ≤ 0. So, we
establish a new long altcoin position, or maintain an existing long altcoin position,
if mom is negative. If mom is nonnegative, then we do not establish a new altcoin
position, and liquidate an existing long altcoin position. All altcoin positions are long
or null. Meanwhile, we continuously maintain a constant short Bitcoin position.11

2.4

Altcoin Weights

Let us assume that the constant short Bitcoin position has the investment level
IS . Let the total investment level of our long altcoin position be IL . To have a
dollar-neutral portfolio, we must set IL = IS . Let His be the individual altcoin
dollar holdings. Let us use the labels i = 2, . . . , N for altcoins, while i = 1 will
correspond to Bitcoin. We can define the altcoin weights as wis = His /IL . Then we
have (wis ≥ 0):
N
X
wis = 1
(5)
i=2

The simplest choice for the weights is to have equal weights for all altcoins with
nonzero signals:
1
αis
ns
N
X
ns =
αis

wis =

(6)
(7)

i=2

Other weighting schemes are possible, e.g., by suppressing the weights by volatility:
αis
σis
mom
αis |βis
|
wis = γ
es
2
σis
...
wis = γs

(8)
(9)
(10)

Here σis is historical volatility (e.g., the standard deviation of the returns Ris0
computed over d previous days s0 = s + 1, . . . , s + d, or the hlv factor defined
in [Kakushadze, 2018], etc.), while the normalization coefficients γs ,e
γs are fixed via
Eq. (5). In our backtests (see below) we focus on equally weighted portfolios (6).
11

Technically, this should be short Bitcoin futures, but we assume a short Bitcoin position.

3.1

Backtests
Estimation Period and Universe

We downloaded12 the data from https://coinmarketcap.com for all 2,116 cryptoassets as of January 19, 2019 (so the most recent date in the data is January 18, 2019),
and 2,115 cryptoassets had downloadable data, albeit for many various fields were
populated with “?”, which we converted into NAs. In our backtests (see below),
we only kept cryptoassets with non-NA price (open, close, high, low), volume and
market cap data, with an additional filter that no null volume was allowed either.13
Cboe Bitcoin Futures (symbol XBT)14 started trading on December 10, 2017.
So, technically speaking, backtesting the strategy before that time might not be
particularly meaningful.15 Still, although we primarily focus on the 1-year backtest
(looking back from January 18, 2019), for comparison and completeness purposes
we also run 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year lookback backtests. For the 1-year backtest we have
417 cryptoassets with historical data, while for the 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year backtests
we have 121, 67, 44 and 13 cryptoassets, respectively.16 For the 1-year backtest we
further break up the universe of the 416 altcoins (which together with Bitcoin make
up the aforesaid 417 cryptoassets) into market cap tiers A,B,C,D,E,F. Thus, the
alpha based on tier A on any given day goes long only the altcoins whose market
cap on the previous day ranks 2 to 30 among all cryptoassets. Similarly, for tiers
B,C,D,E,F the corresponding market cap rank ranges are: 31-60, 61-100, 101-200,
201-300, 301-417. In fact, based on our results (see below), running a backtest for
the full universe of all 416 altcoins would obscure the liquidity effect (see below).

3.2

Results

For various universes mentioned above, Table 1 summarizes the market cap, the
20-day average daily volume, and the daily “turnover” defined as the market cap
12
R source code for data downloads is given in Appendix A of [Kakushadze, 2018]. This code still
works with two minor tweaks. First, the line u <- c(x[22:28]) in the function crypto.data()
now reads u <- c(x[22:27]) due to a formatting change on https://coinmarketcap.com. Second, in the function crypto.hist.prc(), right after the line shared.write.table(x, file,
T), one should now include the following (or similar) line: Sys.sleep(max(rnorm(1, 10,
2), 5)) (which spaces downloads at random intervals). This is due to the apparent change
at https://coinmarketcap.com, which averts “rapid-fire” (i.e., continuous serial) downloads.
13
This is to avoid stale prices. Further, 2 cryptoassets had apparently “artifact” stale prices
during some periods, so they were also excluded from the corresponding backtests (see below).
14
Which is the actual investment vehicle we implicitly assume for our short Bitcoin position.
15
Especially considering the effect Bitcoin futures arguably had on Bitcoin (and other cryptoassets) – see, e.g., [Hale et al, 2018]. For a nontechnical discussion, see, e.g., [Kelleher, 2018].
16
These counts include Bitcoin. Also, these counts exclude the aforesaid 2 cryptoassets with
apparently “artifact” stale prices during some periods. Finally, in 2-year and longer backtests the
cryptoasset “Circuit of Value Coin” (symbol COVAL) is excluded as it had an extraordinarily large
positive return in a short time period and including it would misleadingly “rosy-up” the results.

divided by the 20-day average daily volume. Table 2 and Figures 1-10 summarize
the backtest results. These results suggest that the altcoin-Bitcoin arbitrage alpha
is a low-liquidity effect. It simply is not there for higher liquidity altcoins. However,
the alpha – which hinges on the mean-reversion effect based on the prior day’s
momentum (mom) – is real. Thus, if for the universe 1E (see Tables 1 and 2)
we reverse the signal, we get ROC = -235.16% and Sharpe = -7.18, and if we go
long all altcoins with equal weights in this universe (irrespective of mom),17 we get
ROC = -26.56% and Sharpe = -1.34. Conversely, if we reverse the signal for, say,
the universe 1A, we do not get a positive return. Therefore, the altcoin-Bitcoin
arbitrage alpha appears to be a real effect owing to low liquidity of the altcoins for
which it is present. Put differently, the alpha exists as it cannot be arbitraged away.

Concluding Remarks

So, the altcoin-Bitcoin arbitrage alpha we discuss above is essentially is “a lowliquidity premium” in altcoin returns. In practice, to arbitrage it, one must account
for trading costs – both transaction costs and market impact. For low-liquidity
altcoins the market impact can quickly become prohibitive when attempting to
execute sizable trades. In fact, for the 2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year lookbacks
(where the number of altcoins with historical data is smaller) the naı̈ve pickup in
the performance is due to the fact that most of the altcoins in these universes, even
though they have been around for a while, are lower-cap, lower-liquidity cryptoassets
(which is a telltale sign for persistence), with the notable exception of XRP (Ripple),
which is what “Max” in the market cap corresponds to in Table 1 for these universes.
Can the altcoin-Bitcoin arbitrage alpha – or the momentum indicator on which
it is based – be useful outside outright arbitraging it (which may be challenging due
to the liquidity considerations)? Perhaps. In a sideways cryptoasset market, this
indicator could be used as a guide for executing trades for lower-liquidity altcoins
in other contexts. Thus, statistically, we expect that there is a mean-reversion
effect, and if its yesterday’s momentum is positive, today an altcoin (on average)
is expected to trade lower, and if its yesterday’s momentum is negative, today said
altcoin (on average) is expected to trade higher. This can then conceivably be used
as a “shorter-horizon” (daily) execution signal for longer-horizon trades. It should be
mentioned, however, that the aforesaid alpha is a statistical effect, which is expected
to work better for a sizable cross-section of altcoins, so using it as a “shorter-horizon”
execution signal for such sizable cross-sections of altcoins would make more sense
than for a single (or a few) altcoin(s). In this regard, let us mention [Liew, Li
and Budavári, 2018], whose conclusion is that forecasting (using machine learning
techniques) short-horizon single-cryptoasset returns (for the top 100 cryptoassets by
market cap) appears to be challenging. This also bodes well with our findings here.
17

In this case we have a quasi-static (the altcoin universe can change with market cap fluctuations) dollar-neutral portfolio, which is obtained by setting αis ≡ 1 (i = 2, . . . , N ) in Eq. (6).

R Source Code: Trading Signal

In this appendix we give R (R Project for Statistical Computing, https://www.rproject.org/) source code for computing the altcoin-Bitcoin arbitrage trading signal. The sole function crypto.arb() reads the aggregated data files cr.prc.txt
(close price), cr.open.txt (open price), cr.high.txt (high price), cr.low.txt (low
price), cr.vol.txt (dollar volume), cr.cap.txt (market cap), cr.name.txt (names
of the cryptoassets in the same order as all the other files), and cr.mnbl.txt (1 if
the name is minable, otherwise 0) generated by the function crypto.prc.files()
of [Kakushadze, 2018] (also, see fn.12 hereof). Internally, crypto.arb() computes
the av (average volume), size (market cap), mom (momentum), hlv (intraday volatility) factors of [Kakushadze, 2018] and the trading signal based on mom (together
with the trading universe based on size). The inputs of crypto.arb() are days
(the length of the selection period used in fixing the cryptoasset universe by applying the aforesaid non-NA data and non-zero volume filters, which period is further
“padded” – see below), back (the length of the skip period, i.e., how many days
to skip in the selection period before the lookback period),18 lookback (the length
of the lookback period over which the backtest is run), d.r (the extra “padding”
added to the selection period plus one day, so the moving averages can be computed
out-of-sample; we take d.r = 20), d.v (the av moving average length; we take d.v
= 20), d.i (the hlv moving average length; we take d.i = 20), ix.upper (the rank
of the highest market cap (as of the previous day) altcoin to include in the trading
universe), and ix.lower (the rank of the lowest market cap (as of the previous day)
altcoin to include in the trading universe). The function crypto.arb() internally
computes and plots/outputs the daily P&L and annualized ROC and Sharpe ratio.
crypto.arb <- function (days = 365, back = 0, lookback = days,
d.r = 20, d.v = 20, d.i = 20, ix.lower = NA, ix.upper = 2)

}

In our backtests we always set back = 0. Also note that mnbl and av are not used internally.

Table 2: Backtest results. Lookback is the number of years (and the Cap tier
for the 1-year lookback – see Subsection 3.1). The second column labeled “rank”
determines which altcoins are allowed to be included in the long portfolio on a
given day: “rank” refers to the range of the rank of the market cap on the previous
day among all cryptoassets (with a few cryptoassets excluded as set forth in fn.16
hereof). ROC = annualized return-on-capital (which is given by 365 × P/(IL + IS ),
where P is the average daily P&L, IL and IS are the total long and short investment
levels, and I√
L = IS for dollar-neutrality). Sharpe = annualized Sharpe ratio (which
is given by 365 × P/S, where S is the standard deviation of daily P&Ls).
