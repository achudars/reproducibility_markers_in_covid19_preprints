LOCAL LANGLANDS CORRESPONDENCE FOR REGULAR
SUPERCUSPIDAL REPRESENTATIONS OF GL(n)
MASAO OI AND KAZUKI TOKIMOTO
Abstract. In this paper, we prove the coincidence of Kaletha’s recent construction of the local Langlands correspondence for regular supercuspidal representations with Harris–Taylor’s one in the case of general linear groups. The
keys are Bushnell–Henniart’s essentially tame local Langlands correspondence
and Tam’s result on Bushnell–Henniart’s rectifiers. By combining them, our
problem is reduced to an elementary root-theoretic computation on the difference between Kaletha’s and Tam’s χ-data.

1. Introduction
One fundamental objective in representation theory of p-adic reductive groups
is to establish the conjectural local Langlands correspondence, which predicts the
existence of a natural connection between L-packets (finite sets consisting of irreducible smooth representations) and L-parameters for connected reductive groups
over a p-adic field. From the early days of representation theory of p-adic reductive
groups, a number of results on the local Langlands correspondence have been obtained. Among them, Harris–Taylor’s construction ([HT01] and also by Henniart in
[Hen00]) of the correspondence for general linear groups, which are the most typical examples of connected reductive groups, has a particularly significant meaning.
Since it was established, it has been playing an important role as an indispensable
foundation in a lot of studies.
Recently, several attempts are being made to construct the correspondence for
more general connected reductive groups beyond Harris–Taylor’s work on general
linear groups. One possible approach to constructing the correspondence for general
groups is to restrict the class of representations. For example, in their striking paper
[DR09], DeBacker and Reeder constructed L-packets consisting of so-called regular depth zero supercuspidal representations and their corresponding L-parameters
for unramified connected reductive groups. At present, the most general result
in this direction is Kaletha’s construction for regular supercuspidal representations
([Kal19a]). Regular supercuspidal representations are supercuspidal representations
which are obtained by Yu’s construction ([Yu01]) and satisfy a certain regularity
condition. As we can see in the fact that every supercuspidal representation of GLn
is regular when p does not divide n, the regularity condition is not so restrictive
compared to, for example, the depth zero condition mentioned above. Although
not all supercuspidal representations are regular in general, most supercuspidal representations do have this property. By focusing on such representations, Kaletha

constructed L-packets and their corresponding L-parameters, under the assumption
that the connected reductive group is tamely ramified. (Recently, a construction for
further general supercuspidal representations was announced by him in [Kal19b].)
Furthermore, he succeeded in proving various important properties such as the stability, the standard endoscopic character relation, and so on (under the assumption
of the “torality”).
However, it is not so obvious from his construction whether Kaletha’s correspondence recovers Harris–Taylor’s local Langlands correspondence in the case of
general linear groups. The goal of this paper is to check it, that is, to prove the
following theorem:
Theorem 1.1 (Thereom 6.1). Let F be a p-adic field with odd residual characteristic. Then the local Langlands correspondence of Kaletha coincides with that of
Harris–Taylor for regular supercuspidal representations of GLn (F ).
Here we remark that the oddness assumption on the residual characteristic is
needed for making Kaletha’s construction of the correspondence work.
We explain the outline of the proof of this result. In the following, we let F
be a p-adic field with odd residual characteristic and consider the general linear
group GLn over F . The key ingredients are Bushnell–Henniart’s consecutive work
on the essentially tame local Langlands correspondence ([BH05a, BH05b, BH10])
and Tam’s reinterpretation of their work ([Tam16]).
In the case of GLn , regular supercuspidal representations are nothing but socalled essentially tame supercuspidal representations, which have been intensively
studied by Bushnell–Henniart. Such representations can be parametrized by pairs
(E, ξ) (called F -admissible pairs) consisting of a degree n tamely ramified extension
E of F and a character ξ of E × satisfying a condition called F -admissibility. Then
Bushnell–Henniart showed that the essentially tame supercuspidal representation
BH
−1
F
π(E,ξ)
corresponding to a pair (E, ξ) maps to IndW
WE (ξµrec ) (as an n-dimensional
representation of the Weil group WF of F ) under Harris–Taylor’s local Langlands
correspondence (let us write LLCHT
GLn for it):
WF
BH
−1
LLCHT
GLn (π(E,ξ) ) = IndWE (ξµrec ),

where µrec is a certain tamely ramified character of E × which depends on (E, ξ)
and is called the rectifier of (E, ξ), and gave an explicit formula for the rectifier.
On the other hand, Kaletha’s construction of the local Langlands correspondence
is briefly explained as follows. Let G be a tamely ramified connected reductive
group over F . He first gave a reinterpretation to Yu’s theory of construction of
supercuspidal representations of such a group. According to it, from a pair (S, ξ)
called a “tame elliptic regular pair”, which consists of a tamely-ramified elliptic
maximal torus S of G and its character ξ satisfying some regularity condition, we
KY
obtain an irreducible supercuspidal representation π(S,ξ)
of G(F ). When the group
G is GLn over F , a tamely ramified elliptic maximal torus corresponds to a tamely
ramified extension of F of degree n. Then, in fact, a tame elliptic regular pair is
nothing but an F -admissible pair. More precisely, if an elliptic maximal torus S
corresponds to an extension E of F , then a pair (S, ξ) is tame elliptic regular if and
only if (E, ξ) is F -admissible. Furthermore, Yu’s construction recovers Bushnell–
Henniart’s construction of essentially tame supercuspidal representations, i.e., we
BH ∼ KY
have π(E,ξ)
= π(S,ξ) (see Appendix A).

To a tame elliptic regular pair (S, ξ), Kaletha associated an L-parameter φ in
the following way. First, by the local Langlands correspondence for S, we get
an L-parameter φξ of S. As φξ is a homomorphism from the Weil group WF
to the L-group L S of S, we regard it as an L-parameter of G if we can find an
L-embedding of L S into L G. In fact, a general procedure for creating such an
embedding from certain auxiliary data called “χ-data” is introduced by Langlands–
Shelstad. The point here is that the choice of the set of χ-data may not be unique,
hence Langlands–Shelstad’s construction does not give us an L-embedding in a
canonical way. Then Kaletha constructed a set of χ-data (let us write χKal for it)
carefully from the information of the pair (E, ξ) and defined an L-parameter φ of
G by using Langlands–Shelstad’s L-embedding LjχKal determined by χKal :

the L-embedding obtained from χKal

Therefore, in order to investigate the relation between Harris–Taylor’s and Kaletha’s
constructions, it is necessary to understand the L-parameter obtained in Kaletha’s
way as an n-dimensional representation of WF . In fact, what Tam pursued in his
paper [Tam16] is exactly this point. In his paper [Tam16], he first described the
L-parameter constructed as above explicitly as an n-dimensional representation of
WF . More precisely, for a pair (E, ξ) and a set χ of χ-data, he proved that the
F
L-parameter of GLn obtained as above is given by IndW
WE ξµχ with a character µχ
×
of E determined by χ (see [Tam16, Proposition 6.5] or Proposition 3.4 in this
paper for details). Second, he indeed constructed a set of χ-data (let us write χTam
for it) realizing µrec as µχTam from a pair (E, ξ).
Then, where is the nontrivial point left in our problem of comparing the correspondences of Kaletha and Harris–Taylor? In fact, Kaletha’s construction of the
KY
correspondence requires some additional twist on π(S,ξ)
by a certain character. The
key object at this point is the character “ǫ” defined by DeBacker–Spice in [DS18]
(and also by Kaletha in [Kal19a]). By applying the theory of DeBacker and Spice
to our setting, we may attach a tamely ramified character ǫ of S(F ) to a tame
elliptic regular pair (S, ξ). This character is defined according to a root-theoretic
property of the pair (S, ξ) and appears naturally in the context of an explicit charKY
acter formula for the supercuspidal representation π(S,ξ)
(which was established by
Adler–Spice in [AS09] first and deepened later by DeBacker–Spice and Kaletha).
KY
Then Kaletha associated the L-parameter LjχKal ◦ φξ to the representation π(S,ξǫ)
,
that is, the regular supercuspidal representation arising from the twisted pair (S, ξǫ)
(note that this is again tame elliptic regular):
KY
L
LLCKal
G (π(S,ǫξ) ) = jχKal ◦ φξ .

Therefore, in fact, Kaletha’s χ-data is not exactly the same as Tam’s. Our task is
to prove that the difference between them (i.e., the ratio of µχKal to µ−1
χTam ) is given
by DeBacker–Spice’s character ǫ. To do this, we have to compare the language used
in Adler–Spice–DeBacker and Kaletha’s work with the one in Bushnell–Henniart
and Tam’s work. In the former one, every notion is defined in a sophisticated way
according to the general structure theory of connected reductive groups over p-adic
3

fields. On the other hand, in the latter one, since everything can be described explicitly when specialized to GLn , the corresponding notions are defined concretely
in a Galois-theoretic way. Thus, in order to compare χKal with χTam , we first have
to grasp the relation between these two languages precisely. If we do this appropriately, our problem is reduced to a simple case-by-case computation based on a
classification of root systems with Galois actions arising from elliptic maximal tori
of GLn . Then the result follows from elementary properties of several fundamental
arithmetic invariants such as the Jacobi symbol, Gauss sums, Langlands constants,
and so on.
Thus we would like to conclude this introduction by emphasizing that the theoretically difficult part of our problem can be completed almost just by referring to
Tam’s work.
Organization of this paper. In Section 2, we explain our notation on fundamental objects and several invariants appearing in this paper. In Section 3, we
recall Bushnell–Henniart’s work on Harris–Taylor’s local Langlands correspondence
for GLn and its reinterpretation due to Tam. In Section 4, we review Kaletha’s construction of the local Langlands correspondence and describe it in the case of GLn .
In Section 5, we introduce some preliminary results needed for our comparison of
two χ-data χKal and χTam . What we will do in this section is basically to compare Kaletha’s language, which is abstract and available for general tamely ramified
groups, with Bushnell–Henniart and Tam’s one, which is explicit but specialized
to GLn . Although we believe most of the content in this section are well-known
to experts, we justify them here for the sake of completeness. In Section 6, we
determine the difference between χKal and χTam by a case-by-case computation
and complete the proof of our main result. In Appendix A, we check that when we
regard a tame elliptic regular pair of GLn as an F -admissible pair, Kaletha–Yu’s
and Bushnell–Henniart’s constructions of supercuspidal representations give rise to
exactly the same representation.

2. Notation
First we explain our notation for several notions used in this paper and list their
basic properties.
Prime number: In this paper, we always assume that p is an odd prime
number.
p-adic field: We fix a p-adic field F . Let OF , pF , and kF denote the ring of
integers, the maximal ideal of OF , and the residue field OF /pF , respectively.
Let q be the order of kF . For x ∈ OF , x̄ denotes the image of x in kF . We
write µF for the set of roots of unity in F of order prime to p. We often
regard an element of kF× as an element of µF by the Teichmüller lift. We
write valF for the valuation of F normalized so that valF (F × ) = Z. By
extending it to F so that valF (F × ) = Z again holds, we always regard valF
as a valuation of F .
We fix an algebraic closure F of F and write k F for the residue field of
F . We consider every finite extension of F or kF within these closures. Let
ΓF and WF denote the absolute Galois group of F and the Weil group of
F , respectively.
For a finite extension E of F , we use similar notations to above such
as OE , pE , and so on. We write e(E/F ) and f (E/F ) for the ramification
index and the residue degree of the extension E/F , respectively.
Norm 1 subgroup for a finite field: For a finite field k which contains a
subfield k ′ such that k is quadratic over k ′ (note that then such a k ′ is
unique), we put k 1 to be the kernel of the norm map with respect to k/k ′ :
×

k 1 := Ker(Nrk/k′ : k × ։ k ′ ).
Filtration on additive and multiplicative groups: For a finite extension
E of F , we put
Er := {x ∈ E | valF (x) ≥ r}

and Er+ := {x ∈ E | valF (x) > r}
5

for each r ∈ R. Similarly, for each r ∈ R>0 , we put
Er× := {x ∈ 1 + pE | valF (x − 1) ≥ r}
×
Er+

and

:= {x ∈ 1 + pE | valF (x − 1) > r}.

On the other hand, for a positive integer s ∈ Z>0 , we put
UEs := 1 + psE .
Here we note that, if we put e := e(E/F ) to be the ramification index of
the extension E/F , then we have
s
E×
s = UE
e

for each s ∈ Z>0 .
Remark 2.1. It is well-known that, for finite tamely ramified extensions
E ⊃ K ⊃ F , the norm map NrE/K gives a surjection
e(E/K)s

NrE/K : UE

s
։ UK

for any integer s ∈ Z>0 (see, for example, [Ser79, Chapter V, Section 6,
Corollary 3]). If we use the above normalizations of filtrations of multiplicative groups, this can be expressed as: for any r ∈ R>0 , we have
NrE/K : Er× ։ Kr× .
Level and depth of a multiplicative character: For a finite tamely ramified extension E of F and a multiplicative character ξ of E × , we say
• ξ is of E-level s if ξ|U s+1 is trivial and ξ|UEs is nontrivial, and
E
• ξ is of depth r if ξ|E × is trivial and ξ|Er× is nontrivial.
r+
Note that if we put the depth of ξ to be r, then its E-level is given by
e(E/F )r.
Additive character: Throughout this paper, we fix an additive character
ψF on F of level one, i.e., ψF is trivial on pF , but not trivial on OF .
For a finite tamely ramified extension E of F , let ψE denote the additive
character ψF ◦ TrE/F on E. Note that, by the tameness assumption, this
is again of level one, hence induces a nontrivial additive character of the
residue field kE of E. By abuse of notation, we again write ψE for this
induced additive character of kE .
Quadratic character: For a finite cyclic group C of even order, we write

·
C

for the unique nontrivial quadratic character of C. Note that if we identify
C as a subgroup of C× , then we have an equality of sign

|C|
c
2
C = c

for any c ∈ C.
Jacobi symbol: Let

·
·



denote the Jacobi symbol. ÄWe änote that, for any finite field k with odd

order qk , we have km× = qmk for any integer m which is prime to qk
(here the left-hand side is the quadratic character defined above and the
right-hand side is the Jacobi symbol).
6

Gauss sum: For a nontrivial additive character ψ of a finite field k with odd
order qk , we define its Gauss sum g(ψ) by
X

x
g(ψ) :=
k× ψ(x).
x∈k×

We define the normalized Gauss sum n(ψ) by
−1

n(ψ) := qk 2 g(ψ).
Recall that we have the following well-known identity:
 Ä −1 ä
= qk
n(ψ)2 = k−1
×

(see, e.g., [BH06, (23.6.3)]).
Langlands constant: For a finite extension E/K of p-adic fields and a nontrivial additive character ψ of K, we write λE/K (ψ) for the Langlands
constant, that is, the ratio of local root numbers:
λE/K (ψ) :=

K
ε(IndW
WE

1E , 12 , ψ)

ε(1E , 12 , ψ ◦ TrE/K )

.

When K is a finite extension of the fixed p-adic field F and ψ is given by
ψK (= ψF ◦ TrK/F ), we simply write λE/K for λE/K (ψK ).
General linear group: In this paper, we always write G for the general
“ is then
linear group GLn over F . Note that the Langlands dual group G
given by GLn over the complex number field C. We fix an F -splitting
“
splG := (B, T, {X}) of G and a splitting splG
b := (B, T , {X }) of G. See,
for example, [KS99, Section 1.1] for the precise definition of a splitting. We

3. Description of Harris–Taylor’s LLC due to Bushnell–Henniart
and Tam

In this section, we recall Bushnell–Henniart’s work on Harris–Taylor’s local Langlands correspondence for GLn and its reinterpretation due to Tam.
3.1. χ-data and Langlands–Shelstad’s construction of L-embeddings. Let
S be a maximal torus of G defined over F . Then we have the set Φ(S, G) of
(absolute) roots of S in G, which has an action of ΓF . We recall the following
terminology of Adler–DeBacker–Spice for roots in Φ(S, G):
Definition 3.1. For each α ∈ Φ(S, G), we put Γα (resp. Γ±α ) to be the stabilizer
of α (resp. {±α}) in ΓF . Let Fα (resp. F±α ) be the subfield of F fixed by Γα (resp.
Γ±α ):
F ⊂ F±α ⊂ Fα ←→ ΓF ⊃ Γ±α ⊃ Γα .
• When Fα = F±α , we say α is an asymmetric root.
• When Fα ) F±α , we say α is a symmetric root. Note that, in this case,
the extension Fα /F±α is necessarily quadratic. Furthermore,
– when Fα /F±α is unramified, we say α is symmetric unramified, and
– when Fα /F±α is ramified, we say α is symmetric ramified.
7

Note that a root α is symmetric if and only if the ΓF -orbit of α contains −α.
We write Φ(S, G)sym , Φ(S, G)sym , Φ(S, G)sym,ur , and Φ(S, G)sym,ram for the set
of asymmetric roots, symmetric roots, symmetric unramified roots, and symmetric
ramified roots, respectively.
Remark 3.2. In this paper, we follow the definition of symmetric unramified and
ramified roots given by Adler–DeBacker–Spice (see [DS18, Definition 2.6] or also
[Kal19a, Section 2.2]). Note that this definition is different from Tam’s one used
in his paper (see [Tam16, 1710 page]). In Section 5.1, we investigate the relation between Tam’s notion of symmetric unramified and ramified roots and Adler–
DeBacker–Spice’s one in the case of GLn .
We next recall the notion of χ-data. A set of characters {χα : Fα× → C× }α∈Φ(S,G)
indexed by the elements of Φ(S, G) is called a set of χ-data if it satisfies the
following conditions:
−1
• For every α ∈ Φ(S, G) and σ ∈ ΓF , we have χα
= χ−α and χσ(α) =
−1
χα ◦ σ .
×
• For every α ∈ Φ(S, G)sym , the restriction χα |F × of χα to F±α
is equal to
±α

the quadratic character corresponding to the quadratic extension Fα /F±α .
By using a set of χ-data with respect to (S, G), we can construct an embedding
of the L-group L S into that L G of G in the following manner. First, we take an
element g ∈ G(F ) which induces an isomorphism Int(g) : S ∼
= T between S and
the maximal torus T in the fixed splitting splG by conjugation (note that this
isomorphism is over F ). Then, by considering its dual, we get an isomorphism
b of S and T belonging to the splitting spl . We write b
j
between the dual torus S
b
G
for the embedding
∼ T ֒→ G
“
b=
b
j: S

“
obtained in this way (note that this embedding is defined canonically up to Gb
conjugation). Then, if we have a set χ := {χα } of χ-data, we can extend j to an
L-embedding according to Langlands–Shelstad’s construction. More precisely, we
“
get a G-conjugacy
class of L-embeddings of L S into L G. Here we do not recall
the construction of this extension. See [LS87, Section 2.6] for the details (see also
[Tam16, Section 6.2]). We write Ljχ for this extended L-embedding
L

jχ : L S ֒→ L G

and call it Langlands–Shelstad’s L-embedding determined by the χ-data χ = {χα }.
Remark 3.3. Strictly speaking, this L-embedding Ljχ is well-defined only up to
“
G-conjugation.
However, since our purpose is to construct an L-parameter of G
by using this L-embedding, we do not have to take care of this ambiguity. More
“
concretely, taking G-conjugation
does not change the isomorphism class of an ndimensional Weil–Deligne representation.

3.2. Tam’s description of Langlands–Shelstad’s L-embeddings. Let us assume that S is elliptic in G. Then it is well-known that S corresponds to a finite
extension E of F which is of degree n, that is, S is isomorphic to ResE/F Gm . Recall that, by using this field E, we can describe the set ΓF \Φ(S, G) of ΓF -orbits of
absolute roots of S in G in the following manner (see [Tam16, Section 3.1] for the
8

details). First we fix a set {g1 , . . . , gn } of representatives of the quotient ΓF /ΓE
such that g1 = id. Then we get an isomorphism

where (ΓE \ΓF /ΓE )′ is the set of nontrivial double-ΓE -cosets in ΓF .
If we fix a subset D of {g1 , . . . , gn } such that the double-ΓE -cosets represented

In this paper, we choose such a D in the same way as explained in [Tam16, 1708
page].
Now let us recall Tam’s description of Langlands–Shelstad’s L-embeddings determined by χ-data. We suppose that we have a set χ of χ-data with respect to S.
Then, as we explained in Section 3.1, we obtain an L-embedding Ljχ : L S ֒→ L G
from χ. On the other hand, if we have a character ξ of E × (∼
= S(F )), then we can
attach to it an L-parameter φξ : WF → L S by the local Langlands correspondence
for tori (see, for example, [Yu09]). By composing it with the L-embedding Ljχ , we
may regard it as an L-parameter of G:
L

φξ

jχ

jχ ◦ φξ : WF −→ L S −−→ L G.

As the L-group L G of G is given by GLn (C) × WF , by considering the projection
from L G to GLn (C), we may furthermore regard Ljχ ◦ φξ as an n-dimensional
representation of WF . Then it can be described as follows:
Proposition 3.4 ([Tam16, Proposition 6.5]). We put µχ to be the character of E ×
defined by
Y
χ α |E × .
µχ :=
[α]∈ΓF \Φ(S,G)

Here, forïeach
ò [α] ∈ ΓF \Φ(S, G), we take its representative α ∈ Φ(S, G) to be of
1
the form
for some (unique) g ∈ D. Then the L-parameter Ljχ ◦φξ is isomorphic

to IndW
WE (ξµχ ) as an n-dimensional representation of WF .

δi − δj , then the field Fα is given by the composite field gi (E) · gj (E) of gi (E) and
gj (E). In particular, under the choice of a representative α of [α] as in Proposition
3.4, the source Fα× of the character χα contains E × . Thus restricting χα to E ×
makes sense.
Here we note that, if we suppose that a root α ∈ Φ(S, G) is of the form

3.3. Bushnell–Henniart’s essentially tame LLC. In [HT01], Harris and Taylor
(and also Henniart in [Hen00]) constructed a bijective map, which is called the
local Langlands correspondence for GLn , from the set Π(G) of equivalence classes
“
of irreducible smooth representations of G(F ) to the set Φ(G) of G-conjugacy
classes of L-parameters of G (or equivalence classes of n-dimensional semisimple
Weil–Deligne representations). We write LLCHT
G for this map:
1:1

−→ Φ(G).
LLCHT
G : Π(G) −
Then Bushnell–Henniart’s essentially tame local Langlands correspondence gives an
explicit description of this map LLCHT
G for so-called “essentially tame supercuspidal
representations”. Let us recall what these are briefly.
First, from an F -admissible pair (E, ξ), which is a pair of
• a finite tamely ramified extension E of F of degree n and
• an F -admissible character ξ (see [BH05a, Definition in 686 page] for the
definition of the F -admissibility of a character),
BH
we obtain an irreducible supercuspidal representation π(E,ξ)
of G(F ) according to
the construction of Bushnell–Henniart (see [BH05a, Section 2], [Tam16, Section
5], or Appendix of this paper). We call a representation obtained in this way an
essentially tame supercuspidal representation.
Remark 3.5. Precisely speaking, Bushnell and Henniart first defined essentially
tame supercuspidal representations by using of the notion of the torsion number
of supercuspidal representations (see the beginning of [BH05a, Section 2]). Then
they gave a characterization of essentially tame supercuspidal representations in
terms of F -admissible pairs, that is, they proved that essentially tame supercuspidal
representations are parametrized by F -admissible pairs ([BH05a, Theorem 2.3]).
In this paper we do not go back to the original definition since only the latter
characterization is important from our viewpoint.
For every essentially tame supercuspidal representation, Bushnell–Henniart proved
that its image under the map LLCHT
G can be described by using a character µrec
which depends on each F -admissible pair (E, ξ) and is called the rectifier of (E, ξ)
as follows:
Theorem 3.6 ([BH05a, BH05b, BH10]). There exists a tamely ramified character
µrec of E × , which can be described explicitly in terms of E and ξ, satisfying
WF
BH
LLCHT
G (π(E,ξµrec ) ) = IndWE ξ,

or equivalently,
WF
BH
−1
LLCHT
G (π(E,ξ) ) = IndWE (ξµrec ).

Note that although we simply write µrec for the rectifier, it is defined for each
F -admissible pair (E, ξ) and depends on (E, ξ).
10

What Tam noticed is that this mysterious character µrec of E × has a factorization
in terms of χ-data. Let us take a tamely ramified elliptic maximal torus S of G
which is isomorphic to ResE/F Gm . Then Tam produced a set χTam = {χTam,α }α
of χ-data with respect to (S, G) from an F -admissible pair (E, ξ) and proved the
following:
Theorem 3.7 ([Tam16, Theorem 7.1]). Let µrec be the rectifier with respect to an
F -admissible pair (E, ξ). Then we have
µrec = µχTam .
Here the right-hand side is a character of E × determined by χTam in the manner
of Proposition 3.4.
The definition of Tam’s χ-data χTam is given in [Tam16, Theorem 7.1]. Later we
will recall it precisely (Sections 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4). As a consequence of Theorems
3.6 and 3.7, we get the following corollary:
Corollary 3.8. Let S be an elliptic maximal torus of G which is isomorphic to
ResE/F Gm for a finite tamely ramified extension E of F of degree n. Let ξ be
BH
the irreducible supercuspidal
an F -admissible character of S(F ) ∼
= E × and π(E,ξ)
representation of GLn (F ) arising from the pair (E, ξ). Then we have

LLCHT
G (π(E,ξ) ) = IndWE (ξµχTam ).

4. Kaletha’s LLC for regular supercuspidal representations
In this section, we quickly review Kaletha’s construction of the local Langlands
correspondence in the case of GLn . In [Kal19a], he constructed the local Langlands
correspondence for supercuspidal representations satisfying some regularity condition, which are called “regular supercuspidal representations”, of tamely ramified
connected reductive groups, under a mild restriction on the residual characteristic
p. In particular, his construction works for G = GLn whenever p is an odd prime
number.
4.1. Regular supercuspidal representations. In this section, let us temporarily
consider a general situation where G is a tamely ramified connected reductive
group over F . In general, regular supercuspidal representations are defined to be
supercuspidal representations obtained from “regular Yu-data” according to Yu’s
construction. Here recall that a “(regular) reduced generic cuspidal G-datum”
consists of
• a sequence G0 ( G1 ( · · · ( Gd = G of tame twisted Levi subgroups of
G over F ,
• an irreducible depth zero supercuspidal representation π−1 of G0 (F ), and
• characters φi : Gi (F ) → C× for 0 ≤ i ≤ d
satisfying several conditions. We do not recall the precise definition of a (regular)
reduced generic cuspidal G-datum or Yu’s construction of supercuspidal representations. See [Kal19a, Section 3.5 and Definition 3.7.3] for the definition of a (regular)
reduced generic cuspidal G-datum. In the following, we call a (regular) reduced
generic cuspidal G-datum simply a (regular) Yu-datum. For a given Yu-datum
Yu
denote the irreducible
Ψ = (G0 ( G1 ( · · · ( Gd , π−1 , (φ0 , . . . , φd )), let πΨ
supercuspidal representation obtained from Ψ by Yu’s construction.
11

One of the important discoveries of Kaletha is the following fact saying that regular Yu-data bijectively correspond to “tame elliptic regular pairs”, which are much
simpler objects consisting only of tamely ramified elliptic tori and their characters
(see [Kal19a, Definition 3.7.5] for the precise definition of a tame elliptic regular
pair):
Proposition 4.1 ([Kal19a, Proposition 3.7.8]). Suppose that we have a regular
Yu-datum (G0 ( G1 ( · · · ( Gd , π−1 , (φ0 , . . . , φd )). Then we can construct a
tamely ramified elliptic maximal torus S of G contained in G0 and a character φ−1
Q
on it such that the pair (S, di=−1 φi |S(F ) ) is tame elliptic regular. Moreover, this
procedure
ã
Å Y
d

φi |S(F )
G0 ( G1 ( · · · ( Gd , π−1 , (φ0 , . . . , φd ) 7→ S,
i=−1

gives a bijection from the set of G-equivalence classes of regular Yu-data to the set
of G(F )-conjugacy classes of tame elliptic regular pairs.

Here, “G-equivalence” is the equivalence relation for Yu-data introduced by
Hakim–Murnaghan in [HM08]. Its important nature is that it describes the “fibers”
Yu ∼ Yu
of Yu’s construction, that is, for any two Yu-data Ψ1 and Ψ2 , we have πΨ
= πΨ2 if
1
and only if Ψ1 is G-equivalent to Ψ2 . See [HM08, Definition 6.3] or [Kal19a, Section
3.5] for the definition of G-equivalence. In particular, by Proposition 4.1 and the
definition of regular supercuspidal representations, we can parametrize the set of
equivalence classes of regular supercuspidal representations by the set of G(F )conjugacy classes of tame elliptic regular pairs of G. When a regular supercuspidal
KY
representation π arises from a tame elliptic regular pair (S, ξ), we write π = π(S,ξ)
.
Thus, if (S, ξ) corresponds to a G-equivalence class represented by a Yu-datum Ψ,
KY
Yu
then we have π(S,ξ)
= πΨ
by definition.

{tame elliptic regular pairs}/G(F )-conj.
1:1 (Prop. 4.1)

The key point which we have to keep in our mind here is the following connection
with Bushnell–Henniart’s construction in the case where G = GLn . In this case,
since every tamely ramified elliptic maximal torus of G is isomorphic to ResE/F Gm
for some finite tamely ramified extension E of F of degree n, we obtain a pair (E, ξ)
of such a field E and a character ξ on E × from each tame elliptic regular pair (S, ξ)
of G. In fact, the pair (E, ξ) obtained in this way is F -admissible and, conversely,
every F -admissible pair is obtained from a tame elliptic regular pair (see [Kal19a,
Lemma 3.7.7]). Here note that the proof of [Kal19a, Lemma 3.7.7] works for any
odd prime number p although the condition p ∤ n is imposed in [Kal19a, Lemma
12

BH
3.7.7]. Then the supercuspidal representation π(E,ξ)
constructed from this pair
KY
(E, ξ) in Bushnell–Henniart’s way coincides with π(S,ξ) . Although this coincidence
seems to be well-known to experts, we will explain a proof in Appendix A for the
sake of completeness.
In the following, when a tame elliptic regular pair (S, ξ) of GLn corresponds to
an F -admissible pair (E, ξ), we simply write
π(S,ξ) := π KY ∼
= π BH .
(S,ξ)

(E,ξ)

Remark 4.2. When p does not divide n, every irreducible supercuspidal representation of GLn (F ) is essentially tame. This is almost trivial if we see the original
definition of essentially tame supercuspidal representations via the torsion number
(see [BH05a, Section 2]).
4.2. DeBacker–Spice’s sign and Kaletha’s toral invariant. In this section,
we recall two invariants obtained from Yu-data and used in Kaletha’s construction
of the local Langlands correspondence for regular supercuspidal representations.
(Also in this section, we can take G to be a general tamely ramified connected
reductive group.)
Let us take a Yu-datum (G0 ( G1 ( · · · ( Gd , π−1 , (φ0 , . . . , φd )) of G. Let S
be an elliptic maximal torus of G0 obtained by Proposition 4.1.
The first invariant which we need is DeBacker–Spice’s sign character ǫsym ·ǫsym,ur
introduced in [DS18, Section 4.3]. This is the product of two characters ǫsym and
ǫsym,ur of S(F ). In order to define these two characters, we first define a character
ǫα of S(F ) for an asymmetric or symmetric unramified root α of S in G. For a root
α ∈ Φ(S, G), there exists a unique index −1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1 such that α belongs to
Φii+1 := Φ(S, Gi+1 ) − Φ(S, Gi ).
Here we put G−1 := S. When i is equal to −1, we define ǫα to be the trivial
character 1 of S(F ). When we have 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, we first put ri to be the depth
of the character φi . On the other hand, for each α ∈ Φ(S, G), we can define a set
ordx (α) of real numbers as in [DS18, Definition 3.6] (we will recall its definition
later, see Definition 5.10). Then the character ǫα : S(F ) → C× is defined as
ã
Å
 α(γ)
if r2i ∈ ordx (α),
×
kF
ǫα (γ) :=
α

1
otherwise,
when α is asymmetric, and



 α(γ)
if r2i ∈ ordx (α),
1
k
Fα
ǫα (γ) :=
1
otherwise,

when α is symmetric unramified. Here, in both cases, α(γ) belongs to OF×α by the
ellipticity of S. Thus we may consider its reduction by pFα . We let α(γ) denote its
image in kF×α . Note that, in the latter case, the definition makes sense since α(γ)
×
. Indeed, if
always belongs to the kernel of the norm map NrFα /F±α : Fα× → F±α
we take the nontrivial element τα of the Galois group of Fα /F±α , then we have
τα (α) = −α. In other words, we have τα (α(γ)) = α(τα (γ))−1 for every γ ∈ S(Fα ).
Thus, if γ ∈ S(F ), then we get

−1

= α(γ) · α(γ)−1 = 1.
NrFα /F±α α(γ) = α(γ) · τα α(γ) = α(γ) · α τα (γ)
13

We define ǫsym and ǫsym,ur as products of these ǫα ’s:
Y
ǫsym :=
ǫα and ǫsym,ur :=
α∈ΓF ×{±1}\Φ(S,G)sym

Y

ǫα ,

α∈ΓF \Φ(S,G)sym,ur

where the index set of the first product denotes the set of orbits of asymmetric
roots via the action of ΓF × {±1} (the action of −1 ∈ {±1} is given by α 7→ −α).

Remark 4.3. In DeBacker–Spice’s original paper ([DS18, Definition 4.14]) or Kaletha’s
paper ([Kal19a, 1123 page, (4.3.3)]), the character ǫsym · ǫsym,ur is defined as the
product of ǫα ’s only for roots α belonging to Φd−1
= Φ(S, Gd ) − Φ(S, Gd−1 ). This
d
is because Adler–DeBacker–Spice’s character formula has an inductive nature and
there ([DS18, Section 4.3] or [Kal19a, Section 4.3]) they only describe a sign appearing in a “reduction step from Gd to Gd−1 ”. Thus, in a final form of the full
character formula (cf. [AS09, Theorem 7.1]), the product of ǫα ’s over all roots α
in Φ(S, G) as above appears. Also, when this sign character is used in Kaletha’s
construction of regular supercuspidal L-packets ([Kal19a, 1154 page, Step 3], this
will be explained in Section 4.3), the product is taken over all roots (i.e., the sign
character ǫsym · ǫsym,ur defined as in this paper is used).
The second invariant which we have to consider is the character ǫf,ram defined in
[Kal19a, Definition 4.7.3]. As explained in [Kal19a, Lemma 4.7.4], this is a character
of S(F ) expressed as the product of “toral invariants” f(G,S) for symmetric ramified
roots, which are introduced in [Kal15, Section 4.1]:
Y
f(G,S) (α) for γ ∈ S(F ).
ǫf,ram (γ) =
α∈ΓF \Φ(S,G)sym,ram
α(γ)6=1
ord(α(γ)−1)=0

In fact, as a special feature of general linear groups, we can show that this invariant
is always trivial:
Proposition 4.4. When G = GLn , for every symmetric root α ∈ Φ(S, G)sym , its
toral invariant is trivial, i.e., f(G,S) (α) = 1.
Proof. We first recall the definition of the toral invariant. Let α be a symmetric root
of S in G. Then we have the corresponding quadratic extension Fα /F±α . We take
an element τα ∈ Γ±α − Γα . If we take a nonzero root vector Xα ∈ gα (Fα ) for the
root α, then τα (Xα ) is a root vector for the root τα (α) = −α. Thus their Lie bracket
product [Xα , τα (Xα )] gives a nonzero element of the maximal torus s(Fα ) ⊂ g(Fα ).
On the other hand, the differential dα∨ of the coroot α∨ corresponding to α defines
a nonzero element Hα := dα∨ (1) of s(Fα ). By using these elements, we define the
toral invariant f(G,S) (α) of α by
Å
ã
[Xα , τα (Xα )]
f(G,S)(α) := κα
,
Hα
×
where κα is the unique quadratic character of F±α
corresponding to the quadratic
extension Fα /F±α . Thus, for our purpose, it suffices to find a root vector Xα
satisfying [Xα , τα (Xα )] = Hα .
Let E be a tamely ramified extension of F of degree n corresponding to the
tamely ramified elliptic maximal torus S of G. By taking an F -basis of E, we
obtain an isomorphism
g(F ) = gln (F ) ∼
= EndF (E).
14

Then we may assume that s(F ) ⊂ g(F ) corresponds to E, which is canonically
embedded into EndF (E) as multiplication maps, on the right-hand side. With this
identification in our mind, in order to describe the (absolute) root space decomposition of g via S, we consider the action of (E ⊗F F )× on EndF (E) ⊗F F .
Recall that, in Section 3.2, we took a set {g1 , . . . , gn } of representatives of ΓF /ΓE

Then we can check that
◦ dj is a root vector for the root δi − δj .
Let us assume that our symmetric root α is given by δi − δj and show that
Xα := d∨
i ◦ dj is a desired root vector. First, this element Xα ∈ gα (F ) belongs to
gα (Fα ). Indeed, in order to check this, it suffices to show that τ (Xα ) = Xα for
every τ ∈ Γα . By considering how the ΓF -action on E ⊗F F is converted on ⊕ni=1 F ,
we can easily check that the ΓF -action on characters and cocharacters is given by
∨
τ (δi ) = δτ (i) (hence τ (di ) = dτ (i) ) and τ (δi∨ ) = δτ∨(i) (hence τ (d∨
i ) = dτ (i) ). Here
τ (i) denotes the unique index satisfying gτ (i) ΓE = (τ ◦ gi )ΓE . Thus, for τ ∈ ΓF , τ
belongs to Γα = StabΓF (δi − δj ) if and only if we have τ (i) = i and τ (j) = j. On
∨
the other hand, we can also check that τ (d∨
i ◦ dj ) = dτ (i) ◦ dτ (j) easily. Thus τ ∈ Γα
implies that τ (Xα ) = Xα .
Now let us show that [Xα , τα (Xα )] = Hα . By noting that s(F ) is embedded into

we get τα (i) = j and τα (j) = i. Hence we have

τα (Xα ) = d∨
τα (i) ◦ dτα (j) = dj ◦ di .

By noting that di ◦ d∨

This completes the proof.

4.3. Kaletha’s Construction of L-packets and L-parameters. In [Kal19a],
Kaletha attached an L-packet and an L-parameter to each “regular supercuspidal
L-packet datum” of G. Let us recall his construction briefly. Here we suppose that
G is a quasi-split tamely ramified connected reductive group temporarily (later we
will focus on the case where G = GLn ).
First recall that a regular supercuspidal L-packet datum of G is a tuple (S, b
j, χ, ξ)
consisting of
• a tamely ramified torus S over F whose absolute rank is the same as that
of G,
b ֒→ G
“ whose G-conjugacy
“
• an embedding b
j: S
class is ΓF -stable,
• a set χ of χ-data for (S, G), and
• a character ξ : S(F ) → C×

satisfying several conditions (see [Kal19a, Definition 5.2.4]). Here the meaning of
“a set of χ-data for (S, G)” is as follows (see [Kal19a, Section 5.1] for the details):
First, by considering the converse of the procedure in Section 3.1, we can get a ΓF stable G(F )-conjugacy class J of embeddings of S into G. More precisely, by taking
b of b
“ is equal to T , which
a conjugation, we may assume that the image b
j(S)
j in G
“
is the maximal torus belonging to the fixed splitting splG
b for G. Then, by taking
the dual, we get an isomorphism between S and T, which is the maximal torus
belonging to splG , over F . Hence we get an embedding of S into G (which is over
F ) well-defined up to G(F )-conjugation. In other words, we get a G(F )-conjugacy
class of embeddings of S into G, for which we write J (see [Kal19a, Section 5.1] for
an explanation on the ΓF -stability of J). Then, as explained in [Kal19a, Section
5.1], the class J has a ΓF -fixed element, i.e., an embedding of S into G defined over
F because of the quasi-splitness of G ([Kot82, Corollary 2.2]). By taking such an
embedding j : S ֒→ G defined over F , j(S) gives a maximal torus of G defined over
F . In particular, by pulling back the set Φ(j(S), G) via j, we get a subset Φ(S, G)
of X ∗ (S) which is ΓF -stable. Since this set with ΓF -action does not depend on the
choice of j, we can define the notion of a set of χ-data in the usual way (see Section
3.1). We note that, in the definition of a regular supercuspidal L-packet datum, an
ellipticity condition on S is also imposed (i.e., if we regard S as a subtorus of G by
using j as above, then it should be elliptic). We also note that we can extend b
j to
an L-embedding Ljχ : L S ֒→ L G by using a set of χ-data χ in the same manner as
in Section 3.1.
16

Next let us recall the construction of L-packets and L-parameters. We take
a regular supercuspidal L-packet datum (S, b
j, χ, ξ) of G. First, we obtain an Lparameter from this regular supercuspidal L-packet datum (S, b
j, χ, ξ) just by using
the local Langlands correspondence for tori:

Construction of L-parameters ([Kal19a, Proof of Proposition 5.2.7]): By
applying the local Langlands correspondence for S to ξ, we get an Lparameter φξ of S, which is a homomorphism from WF to L S. On the
other hand, by the Langlands–Shelstad construction, we can extend b
j to
an L-embedding Ljχ from L S to L G by using the set χ of χ-data. Thus,
by composing these two homomorphisms, we get an L-parameter φ of G:
L

φξ

jχ

φ : WF −→ L S −−→ L G.
Next we recall the construction of the L-packet attached to (S, b
j, χ, ξ):

Parametrization of members in each L-packet ([Kal19a, 1154 page]): As
explained in the beginning of this section, from b
j, we get a ΓF -stable G(F )conjugacy class J of embeddings of S into G. We put J to be the set
of G(F )-conjugacy classes of embeddings which belong to J and defined
over F . Then members of the L-packet Πφ for the L-parameter φ are
parametrized by the elements of J .
Construction of members ([Kal19a, 1153-1154 page]): For each j ∈ J ,
we call a tuple (S, b
j, χ, ξ, j) a regular supercuspidal datum of G (mapping
to the regular supercuspidal L-packet datum (S, b
j, χ, ξ)). For each regular
supercuspidal datum (S, b
j, χ, ξ, j), the pair


j(S), ξj := j(S), ǫ · (ξ · ζS−1 ) ◦ j −1
is a (G(F )-conjugacy class of) tame elliptic regular pair of G. Here
ǫ := ǫsym · ǫsym,ur · ǫf,ram
and ζS is the character determined by the “ζ-data” measuring the difference
between χ and “Kaletha’s χ-data” χKal . Kaletha’s χ-data χKal is defined in
[Kal19a, the paragraph before Definition 4.7.3] (note that in [Kal19a] χKal
is written as χ′ ). Later we will recall its definition (Sections 6.2, 6.3, and
6.4). On the other hand, we do not recall the definition of the character
ζS , but point out that it is trivial when χ is equal to χKal (see Step 2 and
Definition 4.6.5 in [Kal19a] for details). We put
KY
| j ∈ J }.
Πφ := {π(j(S),ξ
j)

Remark 4.5. In [Kal19a], L-packets are constructed according to his formalism
of “rigid inner forms”, which was established in [Kal16], and compounded in the
sense that they consist not only of representations of G(F ) but also those of all rigid
inner forms of G. Thus, strictly speaking, we also have to add a datum of a rigid
inner twist to the above explanation of the definition of a regular supercuspidal
datum (see [Kal19a, Definition 5.3.2]). However, since we treat the local Langlands
correspondence only in the case of G itself in this paper, we always take a rigid inner
twist (G′ , ψ, z) in each regular supercuspidal datum (S, b
j, χ, ξ, (G′ , ψ, z), j) to be
b
the trivial twist (G, id, 1), and write shortly (S, j, χ, ξ, j) for (S, b
j, χ, ξ, (G, id, 1), j).
17

Here we note that the above map


(S, b
j, χ, ξ, j) 7→ j(S), ξj := j(S), ǫ · (ξ · ζS−1 ) ◦ j −1

gives a bijection from the set of isomorphism classes of regular supercuspidal data of
G to the set of G(F )-conjugacy classes of tame elliptic regular pairs of G. Indeed,
the well-definedness of this map is explained (implicitly) in Steps 2 and 3 in [Kal19a,
Section 5.3]. Moreover we can check that the inverse map is given by
(S, ξ) 7→ (S, b
j, χKal , ǫ−1 · ξ, j),

where j is the inclusion of S into G and b
j is the embedding constructed in the manner as explained in Section 3.1. As a consequence, we can conclude that Kaletha’s
L-packets are disjoint from each other and exhaust all regular supercuspidal representations of G(F ).
Now let us focus on the case where G = GLn . An important observation coming
from the speciality of the group GLn is that every L-packet constructed in this way
is a singleton. Indeed, as already mentioned before, for every regular supercuspidal
L-packet datum (S, b
j, χ, ξ), the set J is nonempty because of the (quasi-)splitness
of G. Moreover, in general, if we take an element j of J , then we can check easily
that J is parametrized by the set

j
Ker H 1 (F, S) −
→ H 1 (F, G) ,
where the map between two cohomology groups is the one induced from j. As S
is an induced torus when G is GLn , this set is always trivial by Shapiro’s lemma
and Hilbert’s theorem 90. Thus J is a singleton, hence so is the corresponding
L-packet.
In conclusion, Kaletha’s construction of the local Langlands correspondence for
regular supercuspidal representations of G(F ) = GLn (F ) is summarized as follows:
Proposition 4.6. We take a tame elliptic regular pair (S, ξ) of G and consider
the regular supercuspidal representation π(S,ξ) of G(F ) arising from this pair (S, ξ).
Let E be a tamely ramified extension of F of degree n corresponding to S. We write
LLCKal
G (π(S,ξ) ) for the L-parameter corresponding to π(S,ξ) by Kaletha’s construction. Then we have
WF −1
LLCKal
ξµχKal ),
G (π(S,ξ) ) = IndWE (ǫ

where µχKal is the character of E × determined by the set χKal of Kaletha’s χ-data
according to the recipe of Proposition 3.4.
Proof. Let (S, ξ) be a pair as in the statement. Then, as explained in this section,
the L-packet containing π(S,ξ) is a singleton and arises from the regular supercuspidal L-packet datum (S, b
j, χKal , ǫ−1 ξ). Thus the corresponding L-parameter is given
L
by jχKal ◦ φǫ−1 ξ . If we apply Proposition 3.4 to this L-parameter, we obtain the
induced representation as desired.

5. Prerequisites for a comparison of χ-data
5.1. Classification of roots of elliptic tori of GLn . Let E/F be a tamely ramified extension of degree n. We simply write e (resp. f ) for the ramification index
e(E/F ) (resp. residue degree f (E/F )). We take an elliptic maximal torus S in
G which is isomorphic to ResE/F Gm . In this section we classify the symmetric unramified roots and ramified roots in Φ(S, G). Especially, we will determine
18

the relation between symmetric unramified/ramified roots in the sense of Adler–
DeBacker–Spice, which we adopt in this paper, and those in the sense of Tam. We
note that Tam’s definition of the symmetricity of roots coincides with our definition. However, his definition of unramifiedness and ramifiedness for symmetric
roots is different from ours. See [Tam16, 1710 page] for the definition of symmetric
unramifiedness and ramifiedness of Tam.
We first recall an explicit choice of a set of representatives of ΓF /ΓE , following
[Tam16, Section 3.2]. We take uniformizers ̟E and ̟F of E and F , respectively,
so that
e
̟E
= ζE/F ̟F
for some ζE/F ∈ µE . We fix a primitive e-th root ζe of unity and an e-th root
q−1
ζE/F,e of ζE/F , and put ζφ := ζE/F,e
. Then L := E[ζe , ζE/F,e ] is a tamely ramified
extension of F which contains the Galois closure of E/F and is unramified over E.
The Galois group ΓL/F of the extension L/F is given by the semi-direct product
hσi ⋊ hφi, where
σ : ζ 7→ ζ
φ : ζ 7→ ζ

(ζ ∈ µL ),
q

(ζ ∈ µL ),

̟E 7→ ζe ̟E
̟E 7→ ζφ ̟E

and φσφ−1 = σ q . Moreover, as explained in [Tam16, Proposition 3.3 (i)], we can
take a set of representatives of ΓF /ΓE to be
{ΓF /ΓE } := {σ k φi | 0 ≤ k ≤ e − 1, 0 ≤ i ≤ f − 1}.
Here we implicitly regard each σ k φi ∈ ΓL/F as an element of ΓF by taking its
extension to F from L. In the rest of this paper, we always adopt this set of
representatives and use the notations defined in Section 3.2. We note that, as L/E
is unramified, there exists an integer c such that ΓL/E = hσ c φf i.

The following criterion of the symmetricity of roots is a slight enhancement of
[Tam16, Proposition 3.2]:
ï ò
1
Proposition 5.1. Let α ∈ Φ(S, G) be a root of the form
for some g ∈
g
{ΓF /ΓE }.
(1) We have Γα = ΓE ∩ gΓE g −1 .
(2) The root α is symmetric if and only if there exists xg ∈ ΓE such that gxg g ∈
ΓE . Moreover, in this case we have (gxg )2 ∈ Γα and Γ±α = hgxg , Γα i.
Proof. As in the proof of [Tam16, Proposition 3.1], the set Φ(S,ïG)ò is identified with
g
the set of off-diagonal elements in ΓF /ΓE ×ΓF /ΓE by the map 1 7→ (g1 ΓE , g2 ΓE )
g2
19

and the induced ΓF -action on the latter set is described as g(g1 ΓE , g2 ΓE ) = (gg1 ΓE , gg2 ΓE ).
The assertion (1) follows immediately from this.
Let us prove the assertion
ï
ò (2). The same description shows that the ΓF -orbit
1
of −α contains α′ = −1 . Therefore, α is symmetric if and only if ΓE gΓE =
g
ΓE g −1 ΓE holds. This latter condition amounts to the existence of xg , yg ∈ ΓE such
that yg gxg = g −1 , or equivalently, the existence of xg ∈ ΓE such that gxg g ∈ ΓE .
Moreover, for such a choice of xg ∈ ΓE , we have
(gxg )2 = (gxg g)xg ∈ ΓE

and (gxg )2 = gxg (gxg g)g −1 ∈ gΓE g −1 ,

which shows (gxg )2 ∈ Γα by (1). Now again by the description of ΓF -action above
we see that gxg sends α to −α. Hence Γ±α = hgxg , Γα i as required.

We next give a sufficient condition for a given symmetric root to be unramified.
ï ò
1
Lemma 5.2. Let α ∈ Φ(S, G) be a root of the form
for some g ∈ {ΓF /ΓE }.
g
Moreover we assume that α is symmetric.
(1) Suppose that g ∈
/ ΓK for a subfield F ⊂ K ⊂ E. Then we have Fα =
F±α · K.
(2) Let K = F [µE ] be the maximal unramified extension of F in E. If g ∈
/ ΓK
then g is symmetric unramified.
Proof. Let us prove (1). Since Fα ⊃ E ⊃ K, we clearly have Fα ⊃ F±α · K. Let
xg ∈ ΓE be as in Proposition 5.1. As g does not fix K while xg does, the product
gx
gxg does not fix K either. That is, K is not contained in the fixed field F±α = Fα g .
Since Fα /F±α is quadratic, this implies Fα = F±α · K.
Let us prove (2). By (1) we have Fα = F±α · K. Now K/F is unramified and so
is Fα /F±α .

We next investigate symmetric ramified roots. In fact, we can show that they
are of a very limited form as follows:
Proposition 5.3. The set Φ(S, G) has a symmetric ramified root if and only if e
is even. In this caseïthere
ò exists a unique ΓF -orbit of symmetric ramified roots and
1
e .
it is represented by
σ2
ï ò
1
e
Proof. We first prove that if e is even, then the root α =
is a symmetric
σ2
e
ramified root. Let us apply Proposition 5.1 (2) to g := σ 2 . Note that the behaviour
of g on E is particularly simple:
e

g = σ 2 : ζ 7→ ζ

(ζ ∈ µE )

and ̟E 7→ −̟E .

Thus g maps E onto itself and we can take xg as in Proposition 5.1 (2) to be the
identity. In particular, α is symmetric. Moreover, by noting that Fα = E·g(E) = E,
2
]. Hence Fα is a ramified quadratic
we have F±α = E gxg = E g = F [µE , ̟E
extension of F±α . In other words, α is ramified.
We next prove the converse.
ï ò To be more precise, let α ∈ Φ(S, G) be a symmetric
1
ramified root of the form
for some g = σ k φi ∈ {ΓF /ΓE }. Then it is enough to
g
e
show that e is even and g is necessarily equal to σ 2 .
20

First, since our α is symmetric ramified, g fixes F [µE ] by Lemma 5.2 (2). In
other words, we may assume g = σ k with 0 < k ≤ e − 1. Let us show that e is even
and that this k is in fact given by 2e .
We take xg ∈ ΓE as in Proposition 5.1 (2), that is, gxg g belongs to ΓE . Here,
since we have ΓL/E = hσ c φf i, we may assume that xg is given by (σ c φf )r for some
integer r ∈ Z. Then we can easily compute that
xg = σ

f r −1
q −1

cq f

φf r

and gxg g = σ

f r −1
q −1

k(1+qf r )+c q f

φf r .

Thus the condition that gxg g ∈ ΓE can be rephrased as
(1)

k(1 + q f r ) ≡ 0

(mod e).

On the other hand, recall that the unique nontrivial element of the Galois group
ΓFα /F±α is represented by gxg . Thus our symmetric root α is ramified if and only
if
(2)

gxg (ζ) = ζ

(for any ζ ∈ µFα ).

As we have Fα = E · g(E) = F [̟E , ζqf −1 , ζek ] (here ζqf −1 ∈ µE is a primitive
(q f − 1)st root of unity), the condition (2) is equivalent to the condition that
and gxg (ζek ) = ζek .

gxg (ζqf −1 ) = ζqf −1

Since xg lies in ΓL/E and σ fixes µL , the product gxg fixes µE . In particular, the
fr
first equation is automatic. Therefore, by noting that we have gxg (ζek ) = ζekq , we
see that the condition (2) holds if and only if
k(q f r − 1) ≡ 0

(mod e),

which in turn is equivalent to −2k ≡ 0 (mod e) in view of (1). Recalling that
0 < k ≤ e − 1 we conclude that if g is symmetric ramified then e is even and

k = 2e .
We finally describe a condition for a given symmetric root to be unramified.
ï ò
1
Proposition 5.4. Let α ∈ Φ(S, G) be a root of the form
for some g = σ k φi ∈
g
{ΓF /ΓE }. If α is symmetric unramified, then i is given by either 0 or f2 (in the
latter case, f must be even). Moreover, in the case where i = 0, k is not equal to
e
2.
Proof. The first assertion is nothing but [Tam16, Proposition 3.3 (iii)]. The latter
assertion follows from Proposition 5.3.

Now let us summarize the relation between Adler–DeBacker–Spice’s and
ï Tam’s
ò
1
notions of unramifiedness/ramifiedness for symmetric roots. Let α =
∈
σ k φi
Φ(S, G) be a symmetric root with 0 ≤ k ≤ e − 1 and 0 ≤ i ≤ f − 1. Then α is
ramified in the sense of Adler–DeBacker–Spice only when (k, i) = ( e2 , 0). In this
case, α is ramified also in the sense of Tam (see [Tam16, 1710 page]). Next let us
assume α is unramified in the sense of Adler–DeBacker–Spice. Then, by Proposition
5.4, i equals either 0 or f2 . Moreover, the root α is

ramified in the sense of Tam
when i = 0,

5.2. Howe factorization. In this section, we recall the notion of a Howe factorization according to Kaletha’s sophisticated definition. Temporarily let G be a
general tamely ramified connected reductive group over F .
Let S be a tamely ramified elliptic maximal torus of G defined over F and ξ a
character of S(F ). For each positive real number r ∈ R>0 , we define a subset Φr
of Φ(S, G) as in [Kal19a, 1107 page, (3.6.1)] by
Φr := {α ∈ Φ(S, G) | ξ ≡ 1 on NrS(L)/S(F ) ◦α∨ (L×
r )},
where L is the splitting field of the torus S. We let rd−1 > · · · > r1 > r0 be the
real numbers satisfying
\
Φr ′
Φr ( Φr+ :=
r ′ >r

and call them the jumps of ξ. We put rd := depth(ξ) and r−1 := 0 (note that
rd ≥ rd−1 ). Since each Φri is a Levi subsystem of Φ(S, G) by [Kal19a, Lemma
3.6.1], we get a sequence G0 ( · · · ( Gd−1 of tame twisted Levi subgroups of G
corresponding to the sequence Φr0 ( · · · ( Φrd−1 (i.e., each Gi is the tame twisted
Levi subgroup of G which contains S and has Φri as its roots). We put G−1 := S
and Gd := G so that we have G−1 ⊂ G0 ( · · · ( Gd−1 ( Gd .
Definition 5.5 (Howe factorization, [Kal19a, Definition 3.6.2]). A sequence of
characters φi : Gi (F ) → C× for each i = −1, . . . , d is called a Howe factorization
of ξ if it satisfies the following conditions:
(i) Each φi is trivial on Gisc (F ) (the image of the set of F -valued points of the
simply-connected cover of®the derived group of Gi in Gi (F )).
φ−1 = 1
if S = G0 ,
(ii)
– For i = −1, we have

– For all 0 ≤ i ≤ d − ®

φd = 1
if rd−1 = rd ,
– For i = d, we have
depth(φd ) = rd if rd−1 < rd .
(iii) We have

Here see [Yu01, Section 9] for the definition of being Gi+1 -generic of depth ri for
each character φi .

As proved in [Kal19a, Proposition 3.6.7], we can always take a Howe factorization for any given character ξ of S(F ). This fact has been known by Howe and
Moy classically ([How77, Moy86]) in the GLn -case, and the connection between
their definition of a Howe factorization and Kaletha’s one in the GLn -case can be
roughly explained as follows: Let E be a tamely ramified extension of F of degree n
22

corresponding to S ⊂ GLn . In the definition of Howe and Moy, a Howe factorization
of ξ consists of a sequence of subfields
F = Ed ( Ed−1 ( · · · ( E0 ⊂ E−1 = E
and characters ξi of Ei× for each −1 ≤ i ≤ d satisfying several conditions such as
ξ = ξ−1 · (ξ0 ◦ NrE/E0 ) · · · (ξd ◦ NrE/Ed )
(see, for example, [HM08, Definition 3.33]). Suppose that we have such sequences
of fields and characters. Then, by considering the centralizers of
F × = E× ( E× ( · · · ( E× ⊂ E× ∼
= S(F )
d

d−1

−1

in GLn , we get a sequence of tame twisted Levi subgroups of G:
GLn = Gd ) Gd−1 ) · · · ) G0 ⊃ G−1 = S.
Here note that if we put ni := n/[Ei : F ], then Gi is isomorphic to ResEi /F GLni ,Ei .
In fact, this sequence of tame twisted Levi subgroups G0 ( · · · ( Gd−1 has Φr0 (
· · · ( Φrd−1 as its roots. Moreover, if we put φi := ξi ◦ det, we get a Howe
factorization in the sense of Kaletha. Note that, since Gisc (F ) is given by SLni (Ei ),
the triviality condition for φi on Gisc (F ) is equivalent to the condition that it factors
through the determinant map. Furthermore, as the determinant map is nothing
but the norm map NrE/Ei on S(F ) ∼
= E × , we have φi |S(F ) = ξi ◦ NrE/Ei .

See [HM08, Section 3.5] for more detailed explanation on the relation between
these two apparently different definitions of a Howe factorization.
Remark 5.6. In the language of Bushnell–Henniart, the jumps are defined to be the
E-levels of ξi ◦ NrE/Ei for 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1 (see, for example, [Tam16, Section 5.1]).
If we put the E-levels of ξi ◦ NrE/Ei to be ti , then the relation between ti and the
depth ri of φi is expressed as
ti
ri = .
e
This follows from the tameness assumption on E/F and the fact that the depth of
φi |S(F ) is again given by ri (see [HM08, Lemma 2.52]).
The following “descent” property of a Howe factorization will be needed later
(in Section 6.4).
Proposition 5.7. Let G be a tamely ramified connected reductive group over F and
S a tamely ramified elliptic maximal torus of G. Let ξ be a character of S(F ). We
consider a tame twisted Levi subgroup H of G containing S. Then the set of jumps
rd′ ′ −1 > · · · > r0′ of ξ with respect to (S, H) is contained in that rd−1 > · · · > r0 with
′
respect to (S, G) (note that we always have rd′ ′ = rd and r−1
= r−1 ). Moreover we
can take
• a Howe factorization (φ−1 , . . . , φd ) of ξ with respect to S ⊂ G and
• a Howe factorization (φ′−1 , . . . , φ′d′ ) of ξ with respect to S ⊂ H
23

such that we have
φ[i] |S(F )r[i] = φ′i |S(F )r′

i

for any 0 ≤ i ≤ d′ . Here [i] denotes the unique index satisfying r[i] = ri′ .
Proof. Let Φr and Φ′r be the r-th filtration on the sets Φ(S, G) and Φ(S, H) of
roots, respectively. Then, as Φ(S, H) is a subset of Φ(S, G), the first assertion on
the jumps immediately follows from the definitions of {Φr }r∈R>0 and {Φ′r }r∈R>0 .
Moreover, for any index 0 ≤ i ≤ d′ , we have Φ′r′ ⊂ Φr[i−1] and Φ′r′ = Φ′r′ + ⊂
i−1

i

i−1

Φr[i−1]+1 by the definition of jumps. Thus each Hi−1 is contained in G[i−1] and
that Hi is contained in G[i−1]+1 .

Note that, for i = −1, we always have G−1 = H−1 = S by definition.
Now we take a Howe factorization (φ−1 , . . . , φd ) of ξ with respect to S ⊂ G. By
′
noting that rd = rd′ ′ and r−1 = r−1
(i.e., [d′ ] = d and [−1] = −1), we define φ′i as
follows:
φ′i := φ[i−1]+1 |Hi (F ) · φ[i−1]+2 |Hi (F ) · · · φ[i] |Hi (F ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ d′ ,
®
φ−1 |S(F ) · φ0 |S(F ) · · · φ[0] |S(F )
if S = H0 ,

φ0 :=
φ0 |H0 (F ) · φ1 |H0 (F ) · · · φ[0] |H0 (F ) if S ( H0 ,
®
1
if S = H0 ,
φ′−1 :=
φ−1 if S ( H0 .
Then (φ′−1 , . . . , φ′d′ ) gives a desired Howe factorization. Indeed, by [HM08, Lemma
2.52], the depth of φj |S(F ) is equal to that of φj for any j. Note that, although
only positive depth characters are treated in [HM08, Lemma 2.52], it also holds
that the depth of the restriction of a depth zero character is again zero by the tame
descent property of Moy–Prasad filtrations (see, e.g., [AS08, Lemma 3.8]). Hence
the restrictions of φ[i−1]+1 , . . . , φ[i]−1 to S(F )ri′ are trivial and we have
φ[i] |S(F )r[i] = φ′i |S(F )r′ .
i

Moreover, we can check each condition in Definition 5.5 so that (φ′−1 , . . . , φ′d′ ) is a
Howe factorization of ξ with respect to (S, H) as follows:
(i) In general, for any sequence H1 ⊂ H2 of connected reductive groups, the
map H1,sc → H1 ⊂ H2 factors through H2,sc . In particular, the image of
H1,sc (F ) in H2 (F ) is contained in that of H2,sc (F ) in H2 (F ). Thus the
condition (i) for (φ−1 , . . . , φd ) implies that for (φ′−1 , . . . , φ′d′ ).
(ii)
– The condition for i = −1 immediately follows from the definition of
φ′−1 .
– We assume that 0 ≤ i ≤ d′ − 1. Recall that being Hi+1 -generic
of depth ri′ is a condition on the restriction φ′i |Hi (F )x,r′ (see [Yu01,
i

Section 9]). Here x is the point of the reduced Bruhat–Tits building of
Hi determined by S (see Section 5.3) and Hi (F )x,ri′ denotes the ri′ -th
24

Moy–Prasad filtration of Hi (F ) at x. By the same reason as above,
we have
φ′i |Hi (F )x,r′ = φ[i] |Hi (F )x,r′
i

i

by [HM08, Lemma 2.52]. Then, as Hi is a tame twisted Levi subgroup
of G[i] and we have ri′ = r[i] , being G[i]+1 -generic of depth r[i] for φ[i]
implies being Hi+1 -generic of depth ri′ for φ′i .
– Finally, we consider the case where i = d′ . First, if we have rd′ ′ −1 = rd′ ′ ,
then we have r[d′ −1] = r[d′ ] (= rd ). Therefore, by noting that the
sequence r−1 < r0 < · · · < rd−1 is strictly increasing, we necessarily
have r[d′ −1] = rd−1 = rd . Thus the condition (ii) for φd and the
definition of φ′d′ implies that φ′d′ = φd |H(F ) = 1. Next let us suppose
that rd′ ′ −1 < rd′ ′ .
∗ When rd−1 < rd , we have depth(φd ) = rd , hence the sequence
r[d′ −1]+1 < · · · < rd of depths of φ[d′ −1]+1 , . . . , φd is strictly
increasing. Thus, again by noting that the depth behaves well
under the tame descent ([HM08, Lemma 2.52]), we get

depth(φ′d′ ) = depth φ[d′ −1]+1 |H(F ) · · · φd |H(F ) = rd = rd′ ′ .
∗ When rd−1 = rd , we have φd = 1. Thus, similarly to above, we
get

depth(φ′d′ ) = depth φ[d′ −1]+1 |H(F ) · · · φd |H(F ) = rd−1 .

As we have rd−1 = rd = rd′ ′ , we conclude that depth(φ′d′ ) = rd′ ′ .
(iii) This follows immediately by the definition of (φ′−1 , . . . , φ′d′ ) and the condition (iii) for (φ−1 , . . . , φd ).


5.3. Notation around Heisenberg groups. In this section, we recall briefly the
notion of a t-factor which will be needed in the calculation of the factors of χTam
associated to symmetric roots. The content of this section is a summary of [Tam16,
Sections 4 and 5.2].
Let E be a tamely ramified extension of F of degree n. Then we get a hereditary
order of EndF (E) defined by
A := {X ∈ EndF (E) | X · pkE ⊂ pkE for any k ∈ Z}.
We put P to be the Jacobson radical of A, which is given by
P = {X ∈ EndF (E) | X · pkE ⊂ pk+1
for any k ∈ Z}.
E
We consider the quotient
U := A/P
of A by P, which admits a natural kF -vector space structure. Then the following
natural action of E × on EndF (E) induces an E × -action on U:
X ∈ EndF (E),

t ∈ E×,

t · X := t ◦ X ◦ t−1 ,

where t and t−1 on the right-hand side are the multiplication maps via t and t−1 ,
respectively. As this action factors through the finite quotient E × /F × UE1 of order
prime to p, the space U decomposes into a direct sum of eigenspaces with respect
to the E × -action. This decomposition is described as follows:
25

Proposition 5.8 ([Tam16, Proposition 4.4]). We have a decomposition of U into
a direct sum of E × -isotypic subspaces
M
U[g] .
U=
[g]∈ΓE \ΓF /ΓE

Here, for each [g] ∈ ΓE \ΓF /ΓE , the subspace U[g] is canonically identified with the
residue field kE·g(E) of the composite field of E and g(E). Moreover, the action of
×
t ∈ E × on U[g] is given by the multiplication by tg(t)−1 ∈ OE·g(E)
mod pE·g(E) .
Remark 5.9. Recall that we can identify (ΓE \ΓF /ΓE )′ with the set ΓF \Φ(S, G)
of ΓF -orbits of roots. If a double-ΓE -coset [g] corresponds to a root α under this
identification, then we can understand the action of t ∈ E × on U[g] as the multiplication by α(t) ∈ OF×α mod pFα . In other words, U[g] is the α|S(F ) -isotypic part of
ï ò
1
U. Moreover, if we take α to be
as in Section 3.2, then E · g(E) is nothing but
g
Fα .
We next consider an F -admissible character ξ of E × . Recall that then we can
attach a sequence
F = Ed ( Ed−1 ( · · · ( E0 ⊂ E−1 = E
of subfields and a sequence
rd ≥ rd−1 > · · · > r0 > r−1 = 0
of jumps to ξ. Note that, in this paper, we put Ed (not Ed+1 as in [Tam16]) to be
F . We put ti := e · ri (this is the E-level of the i-th character ξi for 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1,
see Remark 5.6) and define integers hi and ji by

For each i, we set

Let V denote the quotient of J 1 by H 1 . As both of H 1 and J 1 are E × -stable,
we can consider a decomposition of this kF -vector space V into a direct sum of
E × -isotypic parts:
M
V[g] .
V=
[g]∈(ΓE \ΓF /ΓE )′
26

On the other hand, by the definitions of H 1 and J 1 , we have a decomposition
V=

d−1
M

Vi

i=0

of V into a direct sum of kF -vector spaces Vi , which are isomorphic to UAjii+1 /UAjii UAhii+1 .
Note that each component Vi is nonzero only when ti is even. Furthermore, in this
case, we can identify Vi with Ai+1 /(Ai + Pi+1 ) by using the fixed uniformizer ̟E
of E. As we have


Ai+1 /(Ai + Pi+1 ) ∼
= (Ai+1 + P)/P (Ai + P)/P ,
we may furthermore regard Vi as a subspace of U which is stable under the action
of E × . In this sense, the [g]-isotypic part V[g] of V can be identified with U[g] if it
is not zero. We define W[g] by
®
U[g] if V[g] = 0,
W[g] :=
0
if V[g] 6= 0 (hence V[g] = U[g] ).
Thus, by definition, we have
U[g] = V[g] ⊕ W[g] ,
and exactly one of V[g] or W[g] is zero.
By taking an F -basis of E, the sequence F = Ed ( Ed−1 ( · · · ( E0 ⊂ E−1 = E
gives rise to a sequence of tame twisted Levi subgroups of G:
G = Gd ) Gd−1 ) · · · ) G0 ⊃ G−1 = S.
Let us suppose that a double-ΓE -coset [g] ∈ ΓE \ΓF /ΓE corresponds to the ΓF orbit of a root α ∈ Φ(S, G). Then we can describe the condition so that V[g] is
zero (or, equivalently, W[g] is not zero) as follows:
• when α belongs to Φ(S, G0 ), we always have V[g] = 0 and W[g] = U[g] , and
• when α belongs to Φii+1 = Φ(S, Gi+1 ) − Φ(S, Gi ) for 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, we have
®
®
0
if ti is even,
U[g] if ti is even,
W[g] =
V[g] =
U[g] if ti is odd.
0
if ti is odd,
Note that, if ti is even in the latter case, V[g] is contained in Vi . Thus Vi can be
identified with
M
U[g]
[g]∈(ΓE \ΓF /ΓE )′
[g]↔α∈Φii+1

when ti is even.
Now suppose that we have a finite group Γ and a symplectic Fp [Γ]-module V (i.e.,
Fp [Γ]-module equipped with a Γ-invariant non-degenerate alternating Fp -bilinear
form). Then we can attach invariants called t-factors t0Γ (V ) and t1Γ (V );
• a sign t0Γ (V ) ∈ {±1} and
• a sign character t1Γ (V ) : Γ → {±1}
to V . We do not recall the definitions of these objects, see [BH10, Section 3.4] or
[Tam16, Section 4.2]. (We note that if V = 0, then t0Γ (V ) = 1 and t1Γ (V ) is trivial.)
We put tΓ (V ) to be a map from Γ to {±1} defined by taking their product:
tΓ (V ) := t0Γ (V ) · t1Γ (V ) : Γ → {±1}.
27

If we put
V[g] :=

®

V[g] ⊕ V[g−1 ]
V[g]

if [g] corresponds to an asymmetric root,
if [g] corresponds to a symmetric root,

then it admits a symplectic Fp [E × /F × UE1 ]-module structure (see [Tam16, Sections
4.2.1, 4.2.2, and 4.2.3]). In particular, we can consider t-factors for V[g] with
• Γ = µ := µE /µF or
• Γ = the subgroup ̟ of E × /F × UE1 generated by the image of ̟E .
On the other hand, for an orthogonal kF [E × /F × UE1 ]-module W (i.e., kF [E × /F × UE1 ]module equipped with a E × /F × UE1 -invariant non-degenerate symmetric kF -bilinear
form), we can attach a fourth root of unity t(W ) ∈ C× in the manner of [Tam16,
Sections 4.3]. (We note that if W = 0, then t(W ) = 1.) Since each
®
W[g] ⊕ W[g−1 ] if [g] corresponds to an asymmetric root,
W[g] :=
W[g]
if [g] corresponds to a symmetric root,
has an orthogonal kF [E × /F × UE1 ]-module structure as explained in [Tam16, Section 4.3], we can consider t(W[g] ). Here we remark that, only in the case where
[g] corresponds to the ΓF -orbit of a symmetric ramified root, we have to make a
special choice of a quadratic form on W[g] . In Tam’s paper, this choice is implicitly
specified in [Tam16, Remark 7.7] (see also a comment in [Tam16, 1755 page, (ii)]).
Since it is necessary to compute the t-factor in this case explicitly for our purpose,
we will recall the precise definition of the quadratic form and the corresponding
t-factor later (see the proof of Proposition 6.2 in the symmetric ramified case in
Section 6.4).
Finally, we also have to explain the relation between these notions and the ingredients used in Kaletha’s construction of the local Langlands correspondence. Thus
let us take a tamely ramified elliptic maximal torus S of G = GLn which corresponds to the tamely ramified extension E of F of degree n. Then, by a tamely
ramified descent property of Bruhat–Tits building ([Pra01]), we can regard the
Bruhat–Tits building B(S, F ) of S as a subset of that B(G, F ) for G. Moreover, as
S is elliptic, the image of B(S, F ) in the reduced building Bred (G, F ) consists only
of one point. We let x denote this unique point.
For each α ∈ Φ(S, G) and r ∈ R, we put
gα (Fα )r := gα (Fα ) ∩ g(Fα )x,r ,
where
• gα is the root subspace of g attached to α and
• g(Fα )x,r is the r-th Moy–Prasad filtration of g(Fα ) at x.
By using this filtration on gα (Fα ), we define a subset ordx (α) of R as follows:
Definition 5.10 ([DS18, Definition 3.6]). We put
ordx (α) := {r ∈ R | gα (Fα )r+ ( gα (Fα )r }.
The following proposition is encoded in the work of Adler–Spice ([AS09]) and
DeBacker–Spice ([DS18]), especially the proofs of [AS09, Proposition 3.8] and [DS18,
Proposition 4.21]. For the sake of completeness, we give an explanation (in the following proof, we temporarily use the notation of [AS09, DS18]):
28

Proposition 5.11. Let x ∈ Bred (G, F ) be the point determined by S. We take a
double-ΓE -coset [g] and a root α ∈ Φ(S, G) whose ΓF -orbit corresponds to [g]. We
put i to be the unique index −1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1 such that α ∈ Φii+1 . When i = −1, we
have V[g] = 0. When 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, we have V[g] 6= 0 (recall that this is equivalent
to that ti = e · ri is even) if and only if we have r2i ∈ ordx (α).
Proof. Since the first assertion was already explained in this section, we prove the
second assertion by assuming that i is not equal to −1.
By the definition of ordx (α), we have r2i ∈ ordx (α) if and only if the quotient
gα (Fα )x, ri /gα (Fα )x, ri + is not zero. Let L be the splitting field of S. Note that the
2
2
Vα in [AS09, Proof of Proposition 3.8], which is the Γα -fixed part of the quotient
gα (L)x, ri : ri + := gα (L)x, ri /gα (L)x, ri + by definition, is nothing but the quotient
2
2
2
2
gα (Fα )x, ri : ri + := gα (Fα )x, ri /gα (Fα )x, ri + by the compatibility of taking the quo2
2
2
2
tient with tamely ramified Galois descent ([Yu01, Corollary 2.3]). Thus it suffices
to show that Vα is isomorphic to V[g] .
As explained in the first paragraph of [AS09, Proof of Proposition 3.8], we can
identify Vα with the α|S(F ) -isotypic part of the ΓF -fixed part of
Lie(Gi , Gi+1 )(L)x,(ri , ri ):(ri , ri +)
2

by the map

X

Xα 7→

τ ∈ΓF /Γα

(note that this isomorphism is S(F )-equivariant). Again by the tamely ramified
descent property of taking the quotient ([Yu01, Corollary 2.3]), the latter space is
identified with the α|S(F ) -isotypic part of Lie(Gi , Gi+1 )(F )x,(ri , ri ):(ri , ri +) , which

6. Comparison of χ-data
6.1. Main theorem.
Theorem 6.1. We assume that the residual characteristic p is odd. Then Kaletha’s
and Harris–Taylor’s local Langlands correspondences coincide for regular supercuspidal representations of GLn (F ). That is, for every regular supercuspidal representation π of GLn (F ), we have
HT

G (π) = LLCG (π).
29

Proof. Let π be a regular supercuspidal representation of GLn (F ) arising from a
KY
tame elliptic regular pair (S, ξ), i.e., π ∼

ramified extension of F of degree n such that S is isomorphic to ResE/F Gm , then
KY ∼ BH
we have π(S,ξ)

of characters on E × . Here let us recall that each character appearing in this equality
is defined as follows:
• For a set χ of χ-data, µχ is defined to be a character of E × given by
Y
µχ :=
χ α |E × ,
[α]∈ΓF \Φ(S,G)

where, for each [α]ï ∈ò ΓF \Φ(S, G), we take its representative α ∈ Φ(S, G)
1
to be of the form
for some (unique) g ∈ D (see Section 3.2).
g
• The character ǫ is defined as the product ǫsym · ǫsym,ur · ǫf,ram , where
– ǫsym is the product of ǫα over the set of ΓF ×{±1}-orbits of asymmetric
roots,
– ǫsym,ur is the product of ǫα over the set of ΓF -orbits of symmetric
unramified roots, and
– ǫf,ram is the contribution of symmetric ramified roots, which is in fact
trivial when specialized to GLn (Proposition 4.4).
Therefore the above equality follows from the following proposition.

Proposition 6.2. Let (S, ξ) be a tame elliptic regular pair of GLn and E a finite
tamely ramified extension
of F of degree n corresponding to S. Let α ∈ Φ(S, G) be
ï ò

a root of the form
for some g ∈ D. When α is asymmetric, we put α′ to be the

We will prove this proposition by a case-by-case computation according to whether
a root α is symmetric or asymmetric (and furthermore whether unramified or ramified when it is symmetric). In the rest of this section, we fix a tame elliptic regular
pair (S, ξ) of GLn . We let E be the finite tamely ramified extension of F of degree
n which corresponds to S. Moreover, according to Tam (see [Tam16, 1735 page,
(5.11)]), we add the following condition to our fixed uniformizer ̟E :
̟E ∈ E0 ,

where E0 is the subfield of E appearing in a Howe factorization of (S, ξ) (in the
sense of Howe and Moy, see Section 5.2). Note that we can always assume this
condition since E is unramified over E0 (see, e.g., [Tam16, Section 5.1]).

Tam’s χ-data at α: Since what we need is only the restriction of χTam,α ·
χTam,α′ to E × , here we recall the value of χTam,α · χTam,α′ at each element
of E × :
• χTam,α · χTam,α′ is trivial on 1 + pE ,
• (χTam,α · χTam,α′ )(γ) = sgnγ (V[g] ) · sgnγ (V[g−1 ] ) for any γ ∈ µE , and
• (χTam,α · χTam,α′ )(̟E ) = t̟ (V[g] )(̟E ).
Here sgnγ (V[g] ) (resp. sgnγ (V[g−1 ] )) is the signature of the permutation of
V[g] (resp. V[g−1 ] ) given by the multiplication by γ (recall that we have
identifications V[g] ∼

Proof of Proposition 6.2: asymmetric case. If V[g] is trivial, then χTam,α ·χTam,α′ |E ×
is trivial. On the other hand, by Proposition 5.11, ǫα is also trivial. Thus we are
done in this case.
In the following, we assume that V[g] 6= 0, or equivalently by Proposition 5.11,
i 6= −1 and r2i ∈ ordx (α). Since ǫα and χTam,α · χTam,α′ |E × are trivial on 1 + pE ,
it is enough to check the equality
ǫα (γ) = (χTam,α · χTam,α′ )(γ)
for γ = ̟E and each γ ∈ µE .
First, as noted in [Tam16, Theorem 7.1 (i) (b)], we have
t̟ (V[g] )(̟E ) = sgnα(̟E ) (V[g] )
by [Tam16, Proposition 4.9 (ii) (a)] (note that V[g] on the right-hand side of the
last equality in [Tam16, Theorem 7.1 (i) (b)] should be correctly V[g] ). Second, by
[Tam16, 1758 page, (7.2)] and the equality preceding [Tam16, 1758 page, (7.2)], we
have
(χTam,α · χTam,α′ )(γ) = sgnα(γ) (V[g] )
for any γ ∈ µE .
Thus, in any case, it suffices to show the equality

for any ζ ∈
Furthermore, by noting that kF×α is a cyclic group, it is enough
to show the above equality only for a generator ζ of kF×α . Then the right-hand side
of the above equality is given by −1. On the other hand, since kF×α acts on V[g]
via the identification V[g] ∼
= kFα , the action of ζ is given by a cyclic permutation
of (|kFα | − 1)-letters (note that only 0 ∈ kFα is fixed). Thus it can be written as a
31

product of (|kFα | − 2) transpositions. As |kFα | is odd by the oddness assumption
on p, we finally get
sgnζ (V[g] ) = (−1)|kFα |−2 = −1.

If V[g] is trivial, then χTam,α |µE is trivial. On the other hand, by Proposition

In the following, we assume that V[g] 6= 0, or equivalently by Proposition 5.11,

On the other hand, by noting that W[g] is trivial if and only if V[g] is nontrivial

to kF1 α . By combining this fact with our assumption that β is not equal to ±1, we
know that it does not lie in kF±α . Thus Fp [β]′ := Fp [β] ∩ kF±α gives the unique
subfield of Fp [β] such that [Fp [β] : Fp [β]′ ] = 2. Moreover, as the Galois group for
kFα /kF±α can be naturally identified with that for Fp [β]/Fp [β]′ by restriction, we
have kF1 α ∩ Fp [β] = Fp [β]1 . Hence β belongs to Fp [β]1 .
Now let us show the above equality (4). If we put t := [kFα : Fp [β]] and qβ :=
|Fp [β]′ |, then we have |kFα | = qβ2t .

However, as β belongs to kF1 α , we would have β qβ +1 = 1 and this contradicts the
assumption that β 6= ±1. Therefore, by the oddness of t, we can conclude that
qβ + 1 divides qβt−2 + · · · + qβ + 1 and this completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 6.2: symmetric unramified case. Since the characters on both
sides of the equality in Proposition 6.2 are tamely ramified, they are equal by
Propositions 6.3 and 6.4.

6.4. Symmetric ramified roots. In this section, we consider the case of symmetric ramified roots. First we recall that the elliptic torus S in G has a symmetric
ramified root only when the ramification index e of the extension E/F is even (see
Proposition 5.3). Thus, in this section, we assume that the ramification index e is
even. Under this assumption, there ïexists
ò a unique ΓF -orbit of symmetric ramified
1
e . As explained in the proof of Proposition
roots and it is represented by α :=
σ2
e
5.3, the element g = σ 2 of ΓF preserves E. Note that thus the field Fα is nothing
but E.
We first take a Howe factorization (φ−1 , . . . , φd ) of (S, ξ) (see Section 5.2). Let
i be the unique index such that −1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1 and the symmetric ramified root α
lies in Φii+1 = Φ(S, Gi+1 ) − Φ(S, Gi ). Note that i 6= −1 since every symmetric root
belonging to Φ(S, G0 ) is unramified (see [Kal19a, the paragraph before Corollary
4.10.1]). We simply write r for the depth ri of the character φi .
Now let us recall the definitions of χKal,α and χTam,α for our symmetric ramified
root α:
Kaletha’s χ-data at α: We take χKal,α to be a character of E × satisfying
the following conditions:
• χKal,α is trivial on 1 + pE ,
• χKal,α |µE is the unique nontrivial quadratic character of µE , and
• χKal,α (2aα ) = λE/F±α ,
where aα is an (any) element of E−r which is a lift of the unique element
āα of E−r /E−r+ satisfying the equality

φi NrS(E)/S(F ) (α∨ (X + 1)) = ψE (āα · X)
for every X ∈ Er /Er+ (see [Kal19a, 1133 page, (4.7.3)]). Here ψE is an
additive character of E taken as in Section 2, λE/F±α is the Langlands
constant (see Section 2), and NrS(E)/S(F ) is the norm map from S(E) to
S(F ). Note that the third condition on χKal,α , when combined with the
with
first two, is enough to characterize χKal,α since r is given by 2s+1
e
some odd integer 2s + 1 (see [Kal19a, Section 4.7]) and χKal,α |F × should
±α
be the quadratic character corresponding to the extension E/F±α by the
definition of χ-data.
Tam’s χ-data at α: We take χTam,α to be the unique character of E × satisfying the following conditions:
• χTam,α is trivial on 1 + pE ,
• χTam,α |µE is the unique nontrivial quadratic character of µE , and
• χTam,α (̟E ) = t0µ (V̟
[g] ) · t̟ (V[g] ) · t(W[g] ).
Note that, by Proposition 5.11 and the oddness of the numerator of r explained above, the module V[g] is zero. In particular, two t-factors t0µ (V̟
[g] )
and t̟ (V[g] ) appearing in the definition of χTam,α (̟E ) are in fact trivial.
35

Thus the key in our calculation of Tam’s χ-data is to determine the factor
t(W[g] ) explicitly.
Remark 6.5. A priori the definition of χKal,α may depend on the choice of a Howe
factorization of ξ. In fact, also for χTam,α , a priori there may be such a dependence
although we cannot see it at this point since we have not recalled the precise
definition of χTam,α (i.e., the definition of t(W[g] )) up to now. However, in fact,
they are independent of the choice of a Howe factorization. We can easily check
this by noting that any two different Howe factorizations are “refactorizations” of
each other (see [Kal19a, Lemma 3.6.6], or also [BH05b, Proposition 1.1 (2)]).
In order to compare χKal,α with χTam,α , we next recall the following factorization
of E/F , which is used in Bushnell–Henniart’s computation of the rectifier:
F = K−1 ( K0 ( K1 ( · · · ( Kl−1 ( Kl ( Kl+1 = E,
where
• K0 /K−1 is an unramified extension,
• Ki+1 /Ki is a quadratic ramified extension for each 0 ≤ i ≤ l − 1, and
• Kl+1 /Kl is a totally ramified extension of odd degree (we put m to be this
degree).
Note that such a factorization is unique and given explicitly by
m
2m
K0 = F [µE ], . . . , Kl−1 = F [µE , ̟E
], Kl = F [µE , ̟E
], Kl+1 = F [µE , ̟E ].

Here, by our assumption on the ramification index, we have l ≥ 1, i.e., we have at
least one quadratic ramified extension in the above sequence. We also note that,
e
since the action of σ 2 on E is given by
ζ 7→ ζ

(ζ ∈ µE )

and ̟E 7→ −̟E ,

e
2

σ belongs to ΓKl−1 − ΓKl .
Now we consider the tame twisted Levi subgroup H of G defined to be the cen×
tralizer of Kl−1
⊂ E× ∼
= S(F ) (note that then H is isomorphic to ResKl−1 /F GL2m )
and a Howe factorization of ξ with respect to S ⊂ H. Then, by Proposition 5.7, we
can construct a Howe factorization (φ′−1 , . . . , φ′d′ ) of ξ with respect to S ⊂ H by
using the Howe factorization (φ−1 , . . . , φd ) of ξ with respect to S ⊂ G satisfying
the following equality for each 0 ≤ i ≤ d′ :
(5)

φ[i] |S(F )r[i] = φ′i |S(F )r′ .
i

Here recall that r0′ < · · · < rd′ ′ (resp. r0 < · · · < rd ) is a sequence of jumps of ξ
with respect to S ⊂ H (resp. S ⊂ G) and [i] denotes the unique index satisfying
r[i] = ri′ . If we put −1 ≤ i′ ≤ d′ − 1 to be the unique index satisfying α ∈
′
′
Φ(S, Hi +1 ) − Φ(S, Hi ), then we have [i′ ] = i. Note that the existence of such an
e
index (or, in other words, the fact that α lies in Φ(S, H)) is guaranteed by that σ 2
belongs to ΓKl−1 .
Here we remark that, in general, a Howe factorization of ξ with respect to S ∼
=
ResE/F Gm ⊂ H ∼
= ResKl−1 /F GL2m,Kl−1 can be regarded as that with respect to
ResE/Kl−1 Gm ⊂ GL2m,Kl−1 (and vice versa). This can be easily checked by noting
that the root system Φ(S, H) for S ⊂ H is given by Φ(ResE/Kl−1 Gm , GL2m,Kl−1 )⋊ΓKl−1
ΓF . Then, by seeing our descended Howe factorization (φ′−1 , . . . , φ′d′ ) as the latter
one, it can be also understood as a classical Howe factorization in the sense of Howe
36

and Moy (see Section 5.2). In the language of Howe and Moy, they are described
as follows. We have a sequence of subfields

Proof of Proposition 6.2: symmetric ramified case. Our task is to show that
χ−1
Tam,α = χKal,α .
For this, by the definitions of χKal,α and χTam,α , it suffices to check that
χ−1
Tam,α (2aα ) = χKal,α (2aα ).
We start from rewriting χKal,α (2aα ). By definition, χKal,α (2aα ) is equal to the
Langlands constant λE/F±α . As E/F±α is quadratic ramified, we have
λE/F±α = n(ψF±α )
(see, for example, [BH05b, Lemma 1.5 (3)]). By noting that Kl−1 is contained in
2
F±α = F [µE , ̟E
] and that the extension F±α /Kl−1 is totally ramified of degree m,
the additive character of kF±α = kE induced by ψF±α is equal to the composition of
the additive character induced by ψKl−1 with the multiplication map via m. Thus
we get

We next rewrite χ−1
Tam,α (̟E ). First, as we already explained in the definition
of Tam’s χ-data, we have χTam,α (̟E ) = t(W[g] ) by the oddness of the numerator
of r. Next, we recall from [Tam16, Section 5.3.4 and Remark 7.7] the expression
of the t-factor t(W[g] ) in terms of a quadratic form and the Gauss sum. For this,
observe that for any subextension L1 /L2 of E/Kl−1 the modules defined by
M
M
W[h] ,
W[h] ⊂ WE/Kl−1 :=
WL1 /L2 :=
[h]∈(ΓE \ΓKl−1 /ΓE )′

[h]∈ΓE \(ΓL2 −ΓL1 )/ΓE

as well as W[g] ⊂ WE/Kl−1 , are naturally vector spaces over kKl−1 = kE . Recall
(i′ )

that these spaces can be regarded as subspaces of U = A/P. Let qKl−1 be the

where we write AKl−1 := EndKl−1 (E) and trAKl−1 /Kl−1 denotes the reduced trace
of AKl−1 /Kl−1 . Here note that this definition makes sense since the space WE/Kl−1
can be identified with (AKl−1 ∩ A)/(AKl−1 ∩ P) ⊂ A/P. We also note that we have
EndKl−1 (E) ∼
= Mat2m (Kl−1 ) and that trAKl−1 /Kl−1 is nothing but the trace as a
(j)

matrix in Mat2m (Kl−1 ). This is the quadratic form qF in [Tam16, 1739 page,
(5.19)] for F = Kl−1 and j = i′ (as remarked before we start this proof, the depth
of φ′i′ = ξi′′ ◦ NrE/E ′′ is equal to r = 2s+1

(i′ )

We remark that, strictly speaking, the quadratic form qKl /Kl−1 in the last quadratic

(i′ )

(i′ )

that, by definition, qKl /Kl−1 |W[g] is nothing but qKl−1 |W[g] . Now let us compute

the discriminant of qKl−1 |W[g] . Since we have dimkE W[g] = 1 (recall Proposition
5.8 and the definition of W[g] ), this is easily done by an explicit computation as
(i′ )

follows (cf. the proof of [BH05b, Proposition 8.3]). We start by extending qKl−1

then AKl−1 := A ∩ AKl−1 (resp. PKl−1 := P ∩ AKl−1 ) is identified with the subset
38

of matrices with entries in OKl−1 that are upper triangular (resp. strictly upper
triangular) when reduced modulo pKl−1 . We have an isomorphism of kE -algebras:

WE/Kl−1 ∼

(xij )1≤i,j≤2m 7→ (x11 , x22 , . . . , x2m,2m ).
The action of ̟E ∈ ̟ on the right-hand side induced by this isomorphism is given
by the translation
(a1 , a2 , . . . , a2m ) 7→ (a2 , . . . , a2m , a1 ).
Thus the submodule W[g] ⊂ WE/Kl−1 is mapped to
2m
2m
(kE
)[g] := {v(a) := (a, −a, . . . , a, −a) ∈ kE

as it can be characterized as the subspace where ̟E acts as multiplication via −1.
Moreover, the trace map trAKl−1 /Kl−1 on AKl−1 induces the summation map

Before we start our comparison of χKal,α and χTam,α , we investigate the relation

āα ∈ E−r /E−r+ satisfying the equality

φi NrS(E)/S(F ) ◦α∨ (X + 1) = ψE (āα · X)

for any X ∈ Er /Er+ . Since we have φi |S(F )r = φ′i′ |S(F )r as explained in (5) and
φ′i′ |S(F ) = ξi′′ ◦ NrE/E ′′ , this is equivalent to
i

ξi′′ ◦ NrE/E ′′ NrS(E)/S(F ) ◦α∨ (X + 1) = ψE (āα · X).

Here we note that the image of X + 1 under the map NrS(E)/S(F ) ◦α∨ from E × to
e
S(F ) ∼

Qn

from S(F ) to i=1 F as in Section 3.2, the coroot α∨ is described as
E × → S(E);

x 7→ (x, 1, . . . , 1, x−1 , 1, . . . , 1).

Here the component having x−1 corresponds to σ 2 ∈ {ΓF /ΓE }. Note that α∨
maps E × into S(E) as E is the splitting field Fα of α. On the other hand, for each
z ∈ S(E), its norm NrS(E)/S(F ) (z) is defined as the product of g(z) over g ∈ ΓF /ΓE .

Appendix A. Comparison of the two constructions of supercuspidal
representations
In this appendix we show that if a tame elliptic regular pair (S, ξ) of G = GLn
corresponds to an F -admissible pair (E, ξ) then the regular supercuspidal repreKY
sentation π(S,ξ)
is isomorphic to the essentially tame supercuspidal representation
BH
π(E,ξ) . This should be well-known to experts, but we record some details here.
In both the constructions, one uses ξ to define an open compact-modulo-center
subgroup of G(F ) and an irreducible representation, and then takes the compact
induction to obtain the irreducible supercuspidal representation associated to the
pair. Apart from the difference in the languages used—one based on orders and
radicals defined by means of lattices, the other based on the Bruhat–Tits theory
and the Moy–Prasad filtrations—each step of the two constructions proceeds in
almost the same way, except at one place. Thus the main point of this appendix
is the comparison of the “only debatable step” ([BH05a, 695 page, Remark 1]) in
BH
KY
the construction of π(E,ξ)
with the corresponding step in that of π(S,ξ)
using the
Heisenberg–Weil representation (see Remark A.2).
We remark that we found [Tam16, Section 5.2], [May17], and [May20] particularly helpful in preparing this appendix.
Let (S, ξ) be a tame elliptic regular pair of G which corresponds to an F admissible pair (E, ξ).
BH
We first review the construction of π(E,ξ)
([BH05a, Section 2] and [BH10, Section
4]), largely following [Tam16, Section 5.2].
Definition of open subgroups: We fix an F -basis of E to regard Matn (F ) ∼
=
EndF (E) (in particular E ⊂ Matn (F )). Recall from Section 5.3 that the
pair (E, ξ) gives rise to sequences of subfields and integers:
F = Ed ( Ed−1 ( · · · ( E0 ⊂ E−1 = E,

td ≥ td−1 > · · · > t0 > t−1 = 0,

Definition of a character θ on H 1 : From ξ (or more precisely its restriction to UE1 ) we construct a character θ on H 1 . Bushnell–Henniart’s construction is somewhat abstract but here we follow [Tam16, 1731 page, (i)]
and express θ in more down-to-earth terms.
Recall from Section 5.2 that we have a factorization of ξ in terms of
characters ξi on Ei× :
ξ = ξ−1 · (ξ0 ◦ NrE/E0 ) · · · (ξd ◦ NrE/Ed ).
41

Among other properties, these characters satisfy the following:
• For i = −1, the character ξ−1 is tamely ramified.
• For 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, the E-level of ξi ◦ NrE/Ei is ti .

We use ξi for 0 ≤ i ≤ d to define θ. Let ci ∈ p−t

that

for x ∈ phEi ∩ Ei . Note that the coset ci + (pE
∩ Ei ) is well-defined.
Putting Ai := EndEi (E) ⊂ EndF (E), we define a character ψci on UAhid by

where, letting ni := [E : Ei ], we write deti : A×
i = GLni (Ei ) → Ei for the
determinant map. Finally, we put θ := θ0 .
It can be checked that θ does not depend on the choice of a factorization
of ξ and only depends on ξ|UE1 .
Definition of an irreducible representation η of J 1 : There exists a unique
representation η of J 1 containing θ (see [Tam16, 1732 page, (ii)]). We only
remark that the proof is based on the fact that J 1 / Ker θ is a Heisenberg
p-group and H 1 / Ker θ is its center (see, for example, [BH05a, Section 2.3]).
Definition of an irreducible representation Λw of J: Recall that we fixed
a uniformizer ̟F of F . We extend η to an irreducible representation Λw
of J by the following conditions (the existence and the uniqueness of such
an extension are proved in [BH05a, Section 2.3, Lemmas 1 and 2]):
(Ext1): The restriction Λw |J 1 is isomorphic to η.
×
(Ext2): The restriction Λw |J 0 is intertwined by A×
0 , i.e., for any a ∈ A0 ,
we have

HomJ 0 ∩J 0,a (Λw |J 0 ∩J 0,a , Λaw |J 0 ∩J 0,a ) 6= 0,
where J 0,a = a−1 J 0 a is the conjugate and Λaw is the representation of
J 0,a obtained as the conjugation of Λw .
(Ext3): We have ̟F ∈ Ker Λw . In particular, det Λw has finite order.
(Ext4): The determinant character det Λw has p-power order.
Note that Λw only depends on ξ|UE1 and the choice of ̟F .
Remark A.1. In fact, (Ext2) is not necessary for the uniqueness. Indeed,
suppose that Λ1 and Λ2 both satisfy the above conditions except for (Ext2).
By (Ext1), the restrictions Λ1 |J 0 and Λ2 |J 0 only differ by a twist with a
character χ of J 0 trivial on J 1 . As J 0 /J 1 is isomorphic to GLn0 (kE0 ),
the character χ factors through the determinant map (note that p is odd
×
), and in particular has
and thus the abelianization of GLn0 (kE0 ) is kE
0
42

order prime to p. As dim η is a power of p, (Ext4) implies that χ is trivial
and hence Λ1 |J 0 and Λ2 |J 0 are isomorphic. Similarly, we can further show
that Λ1 and Λ2 are isomorphic as representations of J by using (Ext3) and
noting that J/h̟F , J 0 i is a cyclic group of order e(E0 /F ), which is prime
to p.
Later we will prove that an irreducible representation of J is isomorphic
to Λw by checking that it satisfies (Ext1), (Ext3), and (Ext4).
Remark A.2. This part is described as the “only debatable step in the
construction” in [BH05a, 695 page, Remark 1]. The crux of this appendix
lies in showing that this definition of Λw is consistent with the construction
KY
of π(S,ξ)
in a suitable sense (Proposition A.5).
Definition of an irreducible representation Λt of J using ξt : First we
take a factorization ξ = ξt ξw of the character ξ characterized by the following conditions:
• The character ξt is tame. In other words, ξw |UE1 = ξ|UE1 .
• We have ̟F ∈ Ker ξw . In particular, ξw has finite order.
• The character ξw has p-power order. In particular, µE ⊂ Ker ξw .
It is easily checked that such a factorization ξ = ξt ξw uniquely exists. We
stress that the uniformizer ̟F here is the same as the one in (Ext3).
Then we construct an irreducible representation Λt of J associated to ξt
×
.
as follows. As ξt is tame, ξt |O× is the inflation of a character ξ t on kE
E

By the Green parametrization [Gre55], ξ t yields
representation λ of GLn0 (kE0 ) ∼
= J 0 /J 1 . Let λ be

̟F ∈ F and that π(E,ξ)
is independent of the choice of an F -basis of E.
Thus in the following we assume that the embedding E ֒→ Matn (F ) induced
by the F -basis restricts to the inclusion E × ∼
= S(F ) ֒→ G(F ) = GLn (F ).
On the other hand, Kaletha’s construction starts with taking a regular Yu-datum
sent to (S, ξ) by the map in Proposition 4.1 ([Kal19a, Proposition 3.7.8]) and then
Yu’s construction [Yu01] yields an open subgroup K of G(F ) and an irreducible

representation κ of K which give rise to a supercuspidal representation π(S,ξ)

c-IndK κ. As in the proof of the surjectivity of [Kal19a, Proposition 3.7.8], we
use a Howe factorization of (S, ξ) as in Section 5.2 to construct a regular Yu-datum
as above. We write φi : Gi (F ) → C× (i = −1, . . . , d) and Ψ = (G0 ( G1 (
· · · ( Gd , π−1 , (φ0 , . . . , φd )) for the Howe factorization and the associated regular
Yu-datum. In particular, we have the following:
• each Gi is as in Section 5.2,
• φi = ξi ◦ deti for i = −1, . . . , d with ξi as in the definition of θ,

N
According to [HM08, Section 3.4], we may express κ as a tensor product di=−1 κi
of irreducible representations, where each κi only depends on φi for 0 ≤ i ≤ d and
κ−1 only depends on π−1 . As this expression is convenient for our argument, below
we often cite [HM08].
In the following, we shall see that K = J holds and moreover show that if we take
a suitable regular Yu-datum Ψ which is G-equivalent to Ψ, then we have κ−1 ∼

In [Yu01, 591 page] the open subgroup K ⊂ G(F ) is defined in terms of the
Moy–Prasad filtration as:
K := K d := G0 (F )[x] G1 (F )x,s0 · · · Gd (F )x,sd−1 ,
where x is a point of the Bruhat–Tits building of G0 associated to S ⊂ G (see
i)
Section 5.3) and si := r2i = depth(φ
for i = 0, . . . , d − 1.
2
Recalling that we arranged the embedding E ֒→ Matn (F ) to be compatible with
the inclusion S ⊂ G, we can check K = J by using the work [BL02] of Broussous–
Lemaire comparing the lattice filtration and the Moy–Prasad filtration as in the
proof of Proposition 5.11.
d
Similarly we find that the compact open subgroup K+
:
d
K+
:= G0 (F )x,0+ G1 (F )x,s0 + · · · Gd (F )x,sd−1 +

is nothing but H 1 .
The conditions required of the factorization ξ = ξt ξw are not exactly consistent
with those imposed on a Howe factorization in Definition 5.5 ([Kal19a, Definition
3.6.2]), so we slightly modify the latter factorization in the following proposition to
eventually obtain a G-equivalent regular Yu-datum.
Proposition A.3. There exists a regular Yu-datum Ψ = (G0 ( G1 ( · · · (
Gd , π −1 , (φ0 , . . . , φd )) which is G-equivalent to Ψ and satisfies the following properties:
G0
(i) π −1 ∼
,
= π(S,ξ
t)
Qd
(ii) i=0 φi |S(F ) = ξw ,
(iii) φi |Gi (F )x,0+ = φi |Gi (F )x,0+ for i = 0, . . . , d, and
(iv) φi has finite p-power order for i = 0, . . . , d.
Proof. Let us define π −1 and φi for i = 0, . . . , d, and thus Ψ = (G0 ( G1 ( · · · (
Gd , π −1 , (φ0 , . . . , φd )). First we put
φ−1 := ξt ,

0

G
π −1 := π(S,φ

−1

).

Next let us define a character φi for each i = 0, . . . , d using φi . For this we need
some auxiliary characters. Recall that the characters ξi on Ei× appearing in the
Q
definition of θ satisfy φi = ξi ◦ deti and ξ = di=−1 (ξi ◦ NrE/Ei ).
×
×
We define characters ζi : E → C for i = 0, . . . , d by the following conditions:
• We have ζi |UE1 = (ξi ◦ NrE/Ei )|UE1 .
• We have ̟F ∈ Ker ζi .
• The character ζi has finite p-power order.
Again these conditions determine the characters ζi uniquely.
The first and third conditions imply that each ζi factors through NrE/Ei . We
take ξ i to be a character on Ei× such that ζi = ξ i ◦ NrE/Ei for each i = 0, . . . , d.
44

We assume ξ i to have p-power order. (Note that, unlike before, there are in general
several possibilities of such ξ i because the index of NrE/Ei (E × ) in Ei× may be
divisible by p.) Also, if φd = 1 and thus ζd = 1, then we arrange ξ d = 1.
Finally we put
φi := ξ i ◦ deti
for i = 0, . . . , d. In particular, if φd = 1, then φd = 1.
Before proving that Ψ is indeed a regular Yu-datum G-equivalent to Ψ, let
us check the required properties (i)-(iv). The property (i) is immediate from the
definition of π −1 . For (ii) it is easy to check that the character
d
Y

φi |S(F ) =

i=0

d
Y

(ξ i ◦ NrE/Ei ) =

Y

ζi

i=0

satisfies the characterizing conditions of ξw by using those of ζi . To see (iii), we note
that we have (ξ i ◦ NrE/Ei )|UE1 = ζi |UE1 = (ξi ◦ NrE/Ei )|UE1 and hence ξ i |UE1 = ξi |UE1 .
i

i

Thus the equalities φi = ξ i ◦ deti , φi = ξi ◦ deti and the inclusion deti (Gi (F )x,0+ ) ⊂
UE1 i imply (iii). The property (iv) holds since ξ i has finite p-power order for each
i = 0, . . . , d.
Finally let us prove that Ψ is a regular Yu-datum and is a refactorization of Ψ in
the sense of [HM08, Definition 4.19] and reviewed in [Kal19a, 1106 page]. Then we
are done because by the definition [HM08, Definition 6.3] of G-equivalence, if two
Yu-data are refactorizations of each other, then they are in particular G-equivalent.
We check the conditions F0-F2 in [Kal19a, 1106 page]:
F0: If φd = 1, then φd = 1 as we arranged above.
F1: For i = 0, . . . , d, we put
χi : Gi (F ) → C× ,

χi (g) :=

d
Y

φj (g)φj (g)−1 .

j=i

UE1 j

by (the proof of) (iii), the depth of χi is 0 (thus
As ξj and ξ j agree on
at most ri−1 ) for all i.
Q
F2: As φ−1 = ξt by definition and di=0 φi |S(F ) = ξw by (ii), we have
Qd
Qd
i=−1 φi |S(F ) = ξ =
i=−1 φi |S(F ) . Therefore, we have
φ−1 = φ−1 · (φ−1
−1 φ−1 ) = φ−1 · χ0 |S(F ) .

Thus [Kal19a, Lemma 3.4.28] implies

as required.
According to [HM08, Lemma 4.22] the conditions F0-F2 also ensure that Ψ is again
a (generic cuspidal) Yu-datum. Moreover, as discussed in the paragraph before
[Kal19a, Example 3.7.4], it is regular.
This completes the proof.

Proposition A.4. With the choice of a regular Yu-datum Ψ = (G0 ( G1 ( · · · (
Gd , π −1 , (φ0 , . . . , φd )) as in Proposition A.3, we have κ−1 ∼
= Λt .
45

Proof. This can be seen by directly comparing the construction of Λt from ξt with

that of κ−1 from π −1 = π(S,ξ

details of the latter one). Note that the definition of π(S,ξ
involves the Deligne–
t)
Lusztig construction [DL76] in place of the Green parametrization. However, the
Deligne–Lusztig construction yields the Macdonald correspondence, which is nothing but the Green parametrization in the case of general linear groups (see [DL76,
Introduction]).


Proposition A.5. With the choice of a regular Yu-datum Ψ = (G0 ( G1 ( · · · (
N
Gd , π −1 , (φ0 , . . . , φd )) as in Proposition A.3, we have di=0 κi ∼
= Λw .

Remark A.6. In fact, the properties (iii) and (iv) of Proposition A.3 are not necessary for this proposition. We assume them for expository convenience in the proofs
of (Ext1) and (Ext4) below.
N
Proof. By Remark A.1, it suffices to check that the representation di=0 κi of K d =
J constructed from the Yu-datum Ψ satisfies the conditions (Ext1), (Ext3), and
(Ext4) in the definition of Λw .
N
Let us show that di=0 κi satisfies (Ext1). As the first step in constructing κi , a
d
character φ̂i on K+
is constructed from φi in [Yu01, 591 page]. The proof of [May17,
Proposition 8.2 (i)] (or [May20, Proposition 8.12 (i)]), together with [BL02], gives
the following expression of φ̂i :
φ̂i = ψci

ξ i (1 + x) = ψF (TrEi /F (ci x))
for x ∈ phEi ∩ Ei , and
• ψci is defined as ψci in the definition of θ with ci in place of ci .
By (iii) of Proposition A.3 we have ξ i |UE1 = ξi |UE1 and thus ψci = ψci . Therefore we

and we have di=0 φi |Z(G)(F ) = ξw |Z(G)(F ) by (ii) of Proposition A.3.
N
To prove that det κi has p-power order for 0 ≤ i ≤ d and thus di=0 κi satisfies
(Ext4), let us review the construction of κi explained in [HM08, Section 3.4] in
some details.
46

In [HM08, 52-53 page] certain open subgroups K i (resp. J i ) of Gi (F ) are defined
for 0 ≤ i ≤ d (resp. 1 ≤ i ≤ d). (Here we stick to the notation in [HM08]. The
BH
symbol J 1 also appeared in the construction of π(E,ξ)
, but what it denotes is not
the same.) Among other properties these groups satisfy
K i+1 = K i J i+1 .
As explained in [HM08, 67 page], for 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, the representation κi of
K = K d = K i+1 J i+2 · · · J d is defined by first constructing a representation φ′i of
K i+1 from φi and then extending it trivially on J i+2 · · · J d . Also, κd is defined
simply as the restriction of φd to K, which has p-power order by (iv) of Proposition
A.3. Thus we are reduced to showing that det φ′i has finite p-power order for
0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1.
The definition of φ′i involves the following diagram:
Ki o o

K i ⋉ J i+1

/ / K i ⋉ Hi



K i+1 ,
where Hi is a finite quotient of J i+1 , the two semi-direct products are induced
from the conjugation action of K i on J i+1 and all the three maps are canonical
surjective homomorphisms. The representation φ′i is defined by first constructing
a representation ωi of K i ⋉ Hi from φi , then taking the tensor product of the
inflations of φi |K i and ωi to K i ⋉ J i+1 and finally showing that this tensor product
representation descends to a representation of K i+1 . As φi has finite p-power order
by (iv) of Proposition A.3, it suffices to prove that det ωi has finite p-power order.
The definition of ωi is divided into two cases according to whether Hi is isomorphic to Fp or a non-trivial Heisenberg p-group. In the first case, the semi-direct
product K i ⋉ Hi is in fact a direct product and ωi is the pull-back of a nontrivial
character on Hi . Then det ωi = ωi indeed has finite p-power order. In the second
case, let Wi be the Fp -vector space obtained by dividing Hi by its center. The
character φi gives rise to a non-degenerate symplectic form on Wi and the action
of K i induces a symplectic action on Wi . Then ωi is defined by means of the
Heisenberg–Weil construction (see [HM08, Section 2.3] and [Yu09, Section 10]). As
Hi is a p-group, it is enough to show that det ωi |K i has finite p-power order. Letting
Sp(Wi ) denote the symplectic group, we see that by the construction of the Weil
representation the restriction det ωi |K i factors through K i → Sp(Wi ) → Sp(Wi )ab .
If we write Vωi for the representation space of ωi , then the situation is summarized
in the following diagram:
