Introduction

Let Ω be an open and bounded domain in RN with C 1,α boundary. In this article, we study
the following eigenvalue problem
(Pλ )

LJ,p(u) = λ|u|p−2 u in Ω, u = 0 in RN \ Ω,

where the operator LJ,p (u) is defined as LJ,p u := −∆p u − ∆J,p u, ∆p (u) := div(|∇u|p−2 ∇u) is
the usual p-Laplacian operator and the nonlocal p-Laplacian is given by
Z
|u(x) − u(y)|p−2 (u(x) − u(y))J(x − y) dy, 1 < p < ∞.
∆J,p u(x) := 2
RN

Here the kernel J : RN → R is a radially symmetric, nonnegative continuous function with
R
compact support, J(0) > 0 and RN J(x) dx = 1. Recently, the study of nonlocal equations

fascinate a lot of researchers. In particular, equations involving fractional p-Laplacian operator gain lot of attention. In [10], Lindgren and Lindqvist studied the eigenvalues of the
following problem
Z
|u(x) − u(y)|p−2 (u(x) − u(y))
dy = λ|u(x)|p−2 u(x) in Ω, u = 0 in RN \ Ω (1.1)

Here they studied the eigenvalues, viscosity solutions and the limit case as p → ∞. Later in
[7], Brasco and Parini studied the problem (1.1) in an open bounded, possibly disconnected
set Ω ⊂ RN and 1 < p < ∞. In this paper, authors also discussed about the regularity of
the eigenfunctions of the operator fractional p-Laplacian and gave the mountain pass characterization of the second eigenvalue of fractional p-Laplacian. Moreover, authors proved the
nonlocal Hong-Krahn-Szego inequality. We cite [6, 11, 12, 14] and references therein for the
work on equations involving fractional p-Laplacian. For the work on second eigenvalue of
p-Laplacian we cite [8, 16] and references therein.
On the other hand, nonlocal equations involving nonlocal p-Laplacian of zero-order, that is,
the following problem
Z
|u(x) − u(y)|p−2 (u(x) − u(y))J(x − y) dy = λ|u|p−2 u

has been studied in [3, 5]. In these papers it has been proved that the Rayleigh quotient
corresponding to problem (1.2) is strictly positive. We refer [3, 4, 5] and references therein
for the work on equations involving nonlocal p-Laplacian of zero-order.
The inspiring point of our work is the work of Del Pezzo et al. ([15]), where authors studied
the eigenvalue problem of the operator LJ,p and proved the existence of the eigenfunction of
the smallest eigenvalue. In particular, authors proved the following result:
Theorem 1.1 Assume p ≥ 2. There exists a sequence of eigenvalues {λk }k∈N of the operator
LJ,p such that λk → +∞. The first eigenvalue λ1 (Ω) is simple, isolated and its corresponding
eigenfunctions have a constant sign. Moreover, λ1 (Ω) can be characterized by

Furthermore, every eigenfunction belongs to C 1,α (Ω) for some α ∈ (0, 1).
We remark that by using the discrete picone identity as in [12], one can get λ1 (Ω) is simple,
isolated and eigenfunctions corresponding to eigenvalue other than λ1 (Ω) changes sign for
all 1 < p < ∞. The variational characterization of second eigenvalue and the Sharp lower
bounds on the first and second eigenvalue remains open question. In the present paper, we
prove the variational characterization of the second eigenvalue of the operator associated to
the problem (Pλ ). Also, we consider the following shape optimization problems
inf{λ1 (Ω) : |Ω| = c},

(1.3)

inf{λ2 (Ω) : |Ω| = c},

(1.4)

Second Eigenvalue

where c is a positive number. For the optimization problem (1.3), we prove the Faber-Krahn
inequality (See Theorem 1.3) which says that
“In the class of all domains with fixed volume, the ball has the smallest first eigenvalue.”
Corresponding to the optimization problem (1.4), we first prove a result for nodal domains
(See Lemma 4.2) whose statement can be rephrased as
“Restriction of an eigenfunction to a nodal domain is not an eigenfunction of this nodal
domain.”
This Lemma is due to the nonlocal nature of the operator. Next we prove the Nonlocal
Hong-Krahn-Szego inequality for the operator associated to problem (Pλ ) (See Theorem 1.4)
which states that
“In the class of all domains with fixed volume, the smallest second eigenvalue is obtained for
the disjoint union of two balls.”
It implies shape optimization problem (1.4) does not admit a solution. Since the Rayleigh
quotient corresponding to problem (Pλ ) does not follow the scale invariance, there is significant
amount of difference in handling the combined effects of p-Laplacian and nonlocal p-Laplacian
of zero order. With this introduction we will state our main results:
Theorem 1.2 Let 1 < p < ∞ and Ω ⊂ RN be an open and bounded set. Then there exists a
positive number λ2 (Ω) with the following properties:
1. λ2 (Ω) is an eigenvalue of the operator LJ,p .
2. λ2 (Ω) > λ1 (Ω).
3. if λ > λ1 (Ω) is an eigenvalue then λ ≥ λ2 (Ω).
Furthermore, λ2 (Ω) has the following variational characterization

where Γ = {γ ∈ C([−1, 1], M) : γ(−1) = −φ1 and γ(1) = φ1 }, φ1 is the normalized eigenfunction corresponding to λ1 (Ω) and M is defined (2.1).
Theorem 1.3 (Faber-Krahn inequality): Let p ≥ 2, c be a positive real number and B be the
ball of volume c. Then

λ1 (B) = inf λ1 (Ω), Ω open subset of RN , |Ω| = c .
Next we will state theorem related to a sharp lower bound in λ2 (Ω).

Second Eigenvalue

Theorem 1.4 (Nonlocal Hong-Krahn-Szego inequality) Let p ≥ 2 and Ω ⊂ RN be an open
bounded set. Assume B is any ball of volume |Ω|/2. Then
λ2 (Ω) > λ1 (B).

(1.5)

Moreover, equality is never attained in (1.5), but the estimate is sharp in the following sense:
if {sn } and {tn } are two sequences in RN such that lim |sn − tn | = +∞ and Ωn := BR (sn ) ∪
n→∞
BR (tn ) then lim λ2 (Ωn ) = λ1 (BR ).
n→∞

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we give the Variational Framework and
Preliminary results. In Section 3 we give the proof of Theorem 1.2. In Section 4 we give the
sharp lower bounds on the first and second eigenvalue of the operator associated to problem
(Pλ ). In particular, we prove the Faber-Krahn inequality and nonlocal Hong-Krahn-Szego
inequality. In Section 5, we discuss the eigenvalue problem associated with the combination
of p-Laplacian and fractional p-Laplacian.

we deduce that ±φ1 are the two global minimum of I as well as critical points of I.
We will now find the third critical point via Proposition 2.2. A norm of derivative of the
restriction I˜ of I at u ∈ M is defined as
kI˜′ (u)k∗ = inf{kI ′ (u) − tS ′ (u)k∗ : t ∈ R}.
Lemma 2.3 I˜ satisfies the Palais-Smale condition on M.

where εn → 0. From (2.2) and Sobolev embedding, we obtain {un } is bounded in W01,p (Ω). It
implies up to a subsequence, still denoted by un , there exists u ∈ W01,p (Ω) such that un ⇀ u
weakly in W01,p (Ω). Moreover, un → u strongly in Lp (Ω) for all 1 ≤ p < p∗ and un → u a.e in

Proposition 2.4 Let A and B be two bounded open sets in RN with A ( B and B connected
then λ1 (A) > λ1 (B).
Proof. By definition of λ1 (A), λ1 (A) ≥ λ1 (B). Now, let if possible λ1 (A) = λ1 (B) and let
φA be normalized eigenfunction of λ1 (A), it implies φA = 0 on RN \ A. Therefore,

Proof of Theorem 1.2

Lemma 3.1 Let 1 < p < ∞. Then number λ∗ (defined in (2.4)) is the second smallest
eigenvalue of LJ,p .
Proof. On the contrary assume that there exists an eigenvalue s such that λ1 (Ω) < s < λ∗ .
It implies that s is a critical value of I˜ . Since λ1 (Ω) is isolated, we may assume that I˜ has
no critical value in (λ1 (Ω), s). To get a contradiction, it is enough to construct a path γ
˜
connecting from φ1 to −φ1 such that I(γ)
≤ s.
Let u ∈ M be a critical point of I˜ at level s. Then u satisfies,

Proof of Theorem 1.2 : By Theorem 3.3 of [15], there exists a positive number λ2 (Ω) given
by
λ2 (Ω) = inf sup HJ,p (u, u),
A∈A u∈A

where A = {A ⊂ M : A compact, symmetric, of genus ≥ 2}. Let γ be a curve in Λ then
by joining this with its symmetric path −γ we obtain a set of genus ≥ 2 where I˜ does not
increase its value. Hence, λ2 (Ω) ≤ λ∗ (defined in (2.4)). From Lemma 3.1, λ∗ is the smallest
eigenvalue. That is, there is no eigenvalue between λ1 (Ω) and λ∗ , it implies λ∗ ≤ λ2 (Ω).
Therefore, λ2 (Ω) is second eigenvalue of the operator LJ,p with variational characterization

we have that φ is a translation of a radially symmetric decreasing function. It implies that Ω

Lemma 4.1 Let 1 < p < ∞ and a, b ∈ R then the following holds:

(ii) If ab ≤ 0 then

|a|p − (p − 1)|a − b|p−2 ba
|a|p − (p − 1)|a|p−2 ba

Lemma 4.2 (Nodal domains) Let λ > λ1 (Ω) be an eigenvalue of LJ,p and φλ be the associated
eigenfunction. Assume the set
Ω+ := {x ∈ Ω : φλ (x) > 0}

and

Ω− := {x ∈ Ω : φλ (x) < 0}.

Then λ > {λ1 (Ω+ ), λ1 (Ω− )}.
Proof. By [15, Corrollary 3.1], we have φλ ∈ C 1,α (Ω) for some α ∈ (0, 1). Therefore, Ω+
and Ω− are open subsets of Ω and hence λ1 (Ω+ ) and λ1 (Ω− ) are well defined. Also, from [15,
Lemma 3.3] φλ changes sign in Ω. Since φλ is an eigenfunction, it implies

Proof of Theorem 1.3 : Let φ2 be the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue λ2 (Ω),
let
Ω+ := {x ∈ Ω : φ2 (x) > 0}

and Ω− := {x ∈ Ω : φ2 (x) < 0}.

It implies |Ω+ | + |Ω− | ≤ |Ω| and using Lemma 4.2 and Theorem 1.3, we have
λ2 (Ω) > λ1 (Ω+ ) ≥ λ1 (Br1 )

and

λ2 (Ω) > λ1 (Ω+ ) ≥ λ1 (Br2 ),

where Br1 and Br2 are two balls such that |Br1 | = |Ω+ | and |Br2 | = |Ω− |. Hence
λ2 (Ω) > max{λ1 (Br1 ), λ1 (Br2 )}

and |Br1 | + |Br2 | ≤ |Ω|.

Claim: max{λ1 (Br1 ), λ1 (Br2 )} is minimized when |Br1 | = |Br2 | = |Ω|/2.
Let Br be a ball such that |Br | = |Ω|/2. Since |Br1 | + |Br2 | ≤ |Ω| therefore we will divide the
proof of claim in three cases.
Case 1: If |Br1 |, |Br2 | ≤ |Ω|/2.
It implies that balls Br1 , Br2 are contained in ball Br then by Proposition 2.4 we have
λ1 (Br ) ≤ λ1 (Br1 ), λ1 (Br2 ). It implies max{λ1 (Br1 ), λ1 (Br2 )} ≥ λ(Br ).
Case 2: If |Br1 | < |Ω|/2 < |Br2 |.
It implies |Br1 | < |Br | < |Br2 |. From Proposition 2.4, we have λ1 (Br1 ) ≤ λ1 (Br ) ≤ λ1 (Br2 ).
Thus, max{λ1 (Br1 ), λ1 (Br2 )} ≥ λ1 (Br2 ) ≥ λ1 (Br ).
Case 3: If |Br2 | < |Ω|/2 < |Br1 |.
Similarly as in case 2 we have max{λ1 (Br1 ), λ1 (Br2 )} ≥ λ1 (Br ).
Hence, from all cases we have max{λ1 (Br1 ), λ1 (Br2 )} is minimized only when |Br1 | = |Br2 | =

|Ω|/2. It proves (1.5).
Now for equality we define Ωn := Br (sn ) ∪ Br (tn ), where {sn } and {tn } are sequences in
RN such that |sn − tn | diverges as n → ∞. Let φsn and φtn are the positive normalized
eigenfunctions on BR (sn ) and BR (tn ) respectively. Let f : S1 → M given by
f (θ1 , θ2 ) =

b = φtn (x) − φtn (y), we obtain

Remarks on the eigenvalues of combination of p-Laplacian
and fractional p-Laplacian

We consider the following eigenvalue problem:
(Fλ )

L(u) = λ|u|p−2 u in Ω, u = 0 in RN \ Ω,

where 1 < p < ∞ and the operator L(u) is defined as L(u) := −∆p u + (−∆)sp u where ∆p u is
the usual p-Laplacian operator and (−∆)sp u is the fractional p-Laplacian is given by
(−∆)sp u(x) := 2 P.V

Ĩ := I|M is C 1 (W01,p (Ω), R), where M is defined as in (2.1). By using the same assertions
and arguments as in the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 we can obtain Theorems 1.1
and 1.2 for the operator L.
