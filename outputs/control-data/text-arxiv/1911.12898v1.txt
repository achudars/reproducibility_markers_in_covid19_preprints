Abstract
In this paper, the physical layer security of a dual-hop underlay uplink cognitive radio network
is investigated over Nakagami-m fading channels. Specifically, multiple secondary sources (Si )1≤i≤N
are taking turns in accessing the licensed spectrum of the primary users and communicating with a
multi-antenna secondary base station (D) through the aid of a multi-antenna relay R in the presence
of M eavesdroppers (Ek )1≤k≤M that are also equipped with multiple antennas. Among the remaining
nodes, one jammer is randomly selected to transmit an artificial noise to disrupt all the eavesdroppers
that are attempting to intercept the communication of the legitimate links i.e., Si -R and R-D. The
received signals at each node are combined using maximum-ratio combining. Secrecy analysis is
provided by deriving closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the secrecy outage probability. The
impact of several key parameters on the system’s secrecy e.g., transmit power of the sources, number
of eavesdroppers, maximum tolerated interference power, and the number of diversity branches is
investigated. Importantly, by considering two scenarios, namely (i) absence and (ii) presence of a friendly
jammer, new insights are obtained for the considered communication system. Especially, we tend to
answer to the following question: Can better secrecy be achieved without jamming by considering a
single antenna at eavesdroppers and multiple-ones at the legitimate users (i.e., relay and end-user) rather
than sending permanently an artificial noise and considering that both the relay and the destination are
equipped with a single antenna, while multiple antennas are used by the eavesdroppers? The obtained

I. I NTRODUCTION
The increasing number of mobile users led to an unprecedented demand for spectral resources.
In this regard, cognitive radio has emerged as a new paradigm that enhances the spectrum
efficiency by allowing its reuse [1]. In underlay cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the issue
of radio-frequency spectrum scarcity is alleviated by allowing the secondary users (SUs) to
share the spectrum with primary users (PUs) under the condition of not causing any harmful
interference to them. Consequently, the SUs are required to continuously adjust their transmit
powers in order to meet the PUs’ quality of service (QoS). Under such constraints, ensuring the
physical layer security (PLS) of multi-hop CRNs becomes a challenge of utmost importance.
To remedy this problem, several techniques can be used to strengthen the secrecy capacity
at each hop namely increasing the number of diversity branches at the receivers, sending a
jamming signal with the highest power, increasing maximum transmit power at the source and
maximum tolerated interference power as well, reducing the number of hops, employing zeroforcing precoding techniques, involving energy harvesting (EH) and non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) technique etc.
Recently, the PLS of CRNs has been the focus of many recent research works. For instance,
non-cooperative CRNs were considered in [2]-[5], therein all receivers i.e., both destination and
eavesdropper were assumed to be equipped with multiple antennas and perform the selection
combining (SC) technique. Particularly, in [2], the source is also assumed to be a multi-antennas
node performing transmit antenna selection, while in [3] the secrecy performance is investigated
for both secondary and primary networks. Closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the
secrecy outage probability (SOP) were derived under Rayleigh [3], [4] and Nakagami-m [2], [5]
fading models.
The PLS of multi-relays dual-hop CRNs was explored in [6]-[9]. Specifically, in [6] and
[7], the communication was performed in the presence of only one eavesdropper attempting to

3

overhear the communication channel, while multiple eavesdroppers were considered in [8] and
[9]. Furthermore, In [6], optimal and suboptimal relay selection were analyzed while in [7] the
relay that minimizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the wiretap link was chosen. Besides,
in [8], the most threatening eavesdropper is selected first according to the maximum SNR of
the wiretap links between the source and the eavesdroppers. Next, the best relay minimizing the
SNR at the selected eavesdropper is then chosen. In [9], the relay that maximizes the achievable
secrecy rate is selected. Under these conditions, closed-form and asymptotic expressions for
the SOP and intercept probability (IP) were derived over either Nakagami-m [6] or Rayleigh
[7]-[9] fading channels. The IP and SOP analysis of cooperative underlay EH-based CRNs have
been investigated in [10] and [10]-[14], respectively. Specifically, the SUs have been assumed to
harvest energy from the PU’s signals in [10]-[12]. In contrast, in [13]-[14] the relay is harvesting
energy from the SU signals instead.
The PLS of NOMA-based CRNs has been investigated in [15]-[16]. In [15], an overlay NOMA
CRN was considered such that the SUs were assumed to be eavesdroppers, while the PLS of
mmWave NOMA CRN was investigated in [16]. Closed-form expressions for the connection
outage probability, SOP and secrecy throughput were derived over Nakagami-m fading channels.
PLS analysis through the aid of a friendly jammer was discussed in [17]-[19]. In [17], the IP
was derived by considering multiple source-destination pairs communicating under eavesdropping
attempts of only one eavesdropper, with the source cooperation aided opportunistic jamming.
In [18], the SOP of dual-hop aided opportunistic jamming CRNs is investigated. In this work,
one relay is selected to forward the information while another one is chosen to disrupt the
eavesdropper by sending an artificial noise. Also, in the two aforementioned works, several
selection policies of the friendly jammer were considered. The impact of the friendly jammer’s
transmit power in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers by considering a direct communication
link between multiple sources and one destination is discussed in [19].
In this work, we investigate the joint impact of the friendly jammer’s transmit power, multiple
SUs with power adaptation constraint, number of eavesdroppers, number of diversity branches,
maximum tolerated interference power at the PU receiver on the PLS of a cooperative underlay
uplink CRNs under Nakagami-m fading model. Without loss of generality, it is worth mentioning
that each user is transmitting its data independently from other users. Consequently, the sources
are assumed to transmit in turns their data while a friendly jammer is randomly selected among
the remaining idle sources to transmit an artificial noise so as to disrupt the eavesdroppers. In

4

this scheme, the nodes R, D, Ek perform MRC technique, hence the knowledge of the channel
state information (CSI) at these nodes is necessary. For this reason, we assume that the CSI is
available. Additionally, eavesdroppers are considered are passive.
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
•

The PLS of an underlay uplink dual-hop CRN operating under Nakagami-m fading environment is investigated by deriving closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the SOP of
the overall system under two scenarios namely, (i) presence and (ii) absence of a friendly
jammer.

•

Under the power adaptation constraint of the SUs, the joint impact of the discussed parameters on the system’s security is investigated.

•

We show that the system’s security is enhanced in the presence of an important number
of eavesdroppers by increasing the (i) SUs’ transmit powers (ii) number of legitimate
destination branches (iii) and maximum tolerated interference power.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system and channel models
are presented. Closed-form as well as asymptotic expressions for the SOP are derived in Section
III. In Section IV, the numerical and simulation results are provided and discussed for various
key parameters’ values. Finally, this work is concluded in Section V.
II. S YSTEM AND CHANNEL MODELS
The considered two-hops CRN, represented in Fig. 1, consists of multiple sources (Si )i=1,..,N ,
one LR -antennas relay R, multiple LEk -antennas eavesdroppers (Ek )k=1,..,M , one destination D
equipped with LD antennas, one PU transmitter (PT x ), and one PU receiver (PRx ). For the
sake of simplicity, we assume that the relay receives the transmitted signals from Si on the LR
antennas and uses only one antenna to forward the message to D. Moreover, we consider multiuser scheduling such that, at any given moment, only one user is transmitting its data. Also, the
source nodes are taking rounds in accessing the spectrum and a friendly jammer SJ is randomly
selected among N − 1 remaining nodes to send an artificial noise. This latter can be canceled
by legitimate nodes, while Ek cannot mitigate it, leading to an increase in the secrecy capacity.
Similarly to [17], we assume that a friendly jammer generates an artificial noise using a pseudorandom sequence that is known to the legitimate users which allows them to cancel out this
noise, while this sequence remains unknown to the illegitimate ones. To this end, the main aim
of this work is to investigate the impact of a friendly jammer, legitimate, and wiretap channels’

5

average SNRs, maximum tolerated interference power as well as the spatial diversity at both the
relay and the end-user on the secrecy performance of the considered communication system. In
this scheme, Nakagami-m fading model is considered for all links. The fading amplitudes of
links Si → R, R → (Dt )1≤t≤LD , Si → Ek , R → Ek , R → PRx , Si → PRx are denoted by
hq where q = {Si R, RDt , Si Ek , REk , RP, Si P }. Consequently, the channel gains gq = |hq |2

III. S ECRECY OUTAGE PROBABILITY
In this section, we start by defining the secrecy capacities for the two hops’ links. Next, we
present the SOP analysis in terms of both closed-form and asymptotic expressions for various
cases of fading severity parameters, specifically, those of the legitimate and the wiretap links
of the first hop. Also, two scenarios will be considered, namely, the presence and absence of a
friendly jammer.

A. Secrecy Capacity
The secrecy capacity can be defined as the maximum rate at which the transmitted information
can confidentially reach its intended destination. In our considered system, the secrecy capacities

Remark 1.

•

One can see from (14) and (15), that the PHY layer security at the first hop

in the presence of a friendly jammer can be enhanced by increasing separately γ I , γ Si ,
or γ SJ . Indeed, the increasing scale of the SNR at the relay exceeds the one of the kth
eavesdropper as a jamming signal is added to the one received by Ek . However, in the
absence of a friendly jammer, one can see from (14) and (16) that only the impact of
legitimate and wiretap channels’ parameters can make the distinction between the two
associated SNRs. Consequently, the smaller λSi R , the greater the secrecy capacity and then
the security gets improved.
•

From (18) and (19), it can be noticed that increasing either γ R or γ I enhances more the
capacity of the legitimate link as D performs the MRC technique. Additionally, increasing
the number of antennas at the receiver increases the SNR at D. Consequently, the system’s
security gets enhanced as well.

B. Exact Secrecy Outage Probability
In this paper, the SOP is chosen as a performance metric and it accounts for the probability
that the secrecy capacity is less than a predefined secrecy rate Rs . For the considered system, the
N sources are taking rounds in accessing the spectrum then one jammer is randomly selected
among the N − 1 remaining sources. The SOP if there were no jamming, can be expressed as
N
1 X
SOP (i) ,
(20)
SOP =

where SOP (i) and SOP (i,J) account for SOP of the system linking Si with D in the presence
of eavesdroppers, and in the absence and presence of the Jth friendly jammer, respectively. The
SOP of the considered system stands for the probability that at least one of the secrecy capacities

are summarized in Table 1. Indeed, the values of fading severity parameter m• have been chosen
such that the wiretap channel is better than the legitimate one. Moreover, their values are taken
integer in the range 2..5 similarly to [6] and [20]. On the other hand, the average SNR, which
is inversely proportional to λ• , the legitimate link is considered better than the one of the
wiretap channel. It is worthwhile that these parameters are associated with all figures except
those indicating other values. As one can see in Figs. 2-5, all closed-form and simulation curves
are perfectly matched for considered parameters’ values.
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 depict closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the SOP versus γ I for
various values of antennas’ numbers in both the presence and absence of a friendly jammer
cases, respectively. As stated in remark 1, It can be noticed that the greater γ I , the smaller the
SOP. Interestingly, above a certain threshold of γ I the SOP becomes steady this can be obviously
justified from (8) and (9) that above that threshold, both sources and relay will always transmit
with their maximum powers. Consequently, the legitimate and wiretap capacities of each hop

remain constant, leading to a constant value of SOP. Interestingly, by comparing the SOP values
in the two aforementioned figures, one can ascertain that better secrecy is achieved by using
a friendly jammer. In addition, the asymptotic curves are plotted under the considered fading
severity values (i.e., mSi R = 2, mSJ Ek = 5) from Eqs. (37), (51)-(53). Clearly, the asymptotic
curves match with the closed-form ones in high SNR regime.
Fig. 4 illustrates the SOP versus γ SJ for numerous values of branches’ number LD at the
receiver D. Again, as indicated in remark 1, one can realize that the higher γ SJ and LD , the
smaller the SOP and therefore the system’s security gets improved.
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the SOP as a function of the number of eavesdroppers M for different
values of γ SJ and by considering both cases i.e., presence and absence of jammer. One can
observe that the smaller γ SJ or the greater M the worst is the system’s secrecy as highlighted in
remark 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, introducing a jamming signal improves significantly the
secrecy performance for high values of γ SJ or in the presence of small numbers of eavesdroppers.
Fig. 7 depicts the SOP as a function of the number of eavesdroppers by considering the presence
and absence of a friendly jammer. It is worth mentioning that better security is obviously achieved
for the case of presence of jammer and multi-antenna nodes, while the scenario of the absence of
jammer and legitimate nodes equipped with a single antenna is the worst case. For this reason, our

aim here is to investigate if the security gets enhanced when having artificial noise and legitimate
nodes with a single antenna or the scenario of the absence of jammer and all legitimate nodes
are equipped with multiple antennas. One can obviously notice that the system’s security is
improved when diversity is used at the legitimate nodes. Additionally, in the presence of an
important number of eavesdroppers, the friendly jammer does not contribute to the enhancement
of the system’s security.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the physical layer security of a dual-hop underlay uplink CRN operating under
Nakagami-m fading channels was investigated. We considered multiple sources communicating,
in turn, with the base station through a relay in the presence of several eavesdroppers attempting
to overhear the communication channels. All receivers, i.e., legitimates and wiretappers, were
assumed to be equipped with multiple antennas and perform the MRC technique. Closed-form
and asymptotic expressions for the SOP under various cases of fading parameters’ values were

derived by considering two scenarios namely, (i) presence and (ii) absence of a friendly jammer.
The obtained results showed that the best secrecy is achieved in the presence of a small number
of eavesdroppers when increasing the transmit power of the SUs’, the number of antennas
at the legitimate receiver and the maximum tolerated interference power at the PU as well.
Interestingly, we showed that equipping the legitimate nodes by multiple antennas leads to a
noticeable enhancement of the system’s security rather than sending an artificial noise. As future
work, we intend to investigate the impact of NOMA jointly with the key parameters considered
in this work on the system’s secrecy. We also intend to consider the case of amplify-and-forward

A PPENDIX B:

PROOF OF THEOREM

2

In this section, we make use of the residues theorem in order to find the approximate
expressions of Meijer-G’s function given in (24).

1) Case 1: Presence of Jammer: The Meijer-G’s functions M1

(24) can be expressed in terms of complex integral as

Γ (LEk mSJ Ek + s) Γ (1 + h − s)

Γ (1 − s)

× Γ (LEk mSi Ek + l − h + s) Γ (−s)
× Γ (mSJ P − s, ϕJ ) z −s ds.

(89)

It is noteworthy that the conditions of [22, Theorem 1.5] are satisfied. That is, the two above
functions can be written as an infinite sum of the poles belonging to the left half plan of L3 .
Furthermore, as the upper incomplete gamma function in (89) is always finite for ϕJ 6= 0, it
follows that the integrand functions of the two above equations have the same poles. Additionally,
it is clearly seen that the order of the left poles depends on the values of LEk mSJ Ek , LEk mSi Ek ,
h, and l. Owing to this fact, three cases can be distinguished:
•

−LEk mSJ Ek < −LEk mSi Ek − l + h: In this case, the two integrand functions given in (88)
and (89) admit −χh,l,r with χh,l,r = LEk mSi Ek + l − h + r and 0 ≤ r ≤ LEk mSJ Ek −
LEk mSi Ek − l + h − 1 as simple poles and −%r with %r = LEk mSJ Ek + r and r natural
number as poles of second-order.

•

−LEk mSJ Ek > −LEk mSi Ek − l + h : Under this condition, the aforementioned integrands
have −%r with 0 ≤ r ≤ LEk mSi Ek − LEk mSJ Ek + l − h − 1 as simple poles and −χh,l,r
where r ∈ N as poles of second-order.

•

−LEk mSJ Ek = −LEk mSi Ek − l + h : Under this assumption, the two integrands admit only
poles of second-order at −%r , r ∈ N.

a. −LEk mSJ Ek < −LEk mSi Ek −l + h
(h,l)

Relied on [22, Theorem 1.5], M1
mentioned poles

(z) can be rewritten as series of residues at the afore-

Obviously, the limit of Q1 (s, z) can be expressed as

lim Q1 (s, z) =
s→−χh,l,r
r!χh,l,r
× Γ (LEk mSJ Ek − χh,l,r ) z χh,l,r .

(93)

On the other hand, using [24, Eqs. (06.14.06.0026.01) and (06.14.16.0003.01)] the partial derivative of Q2 (s, z) is given by
∂Q2 (s, z)

(94)

where G (h,l,r) (z, s) = − log z + ψ(r + 1) + ψ(%r − χh,l,r + r + 1) − 1s − ψ(1 + h − s).
Replacing (94) and (93) into (90), yields

It is worth mentioning that the conditions of [22] are applied also here. Thus, the above integrand
function can be written as an infinite sum of the left poles in L4 . Besides, that integrand admits
only poles of the first order at 0 and −LR mSi R − r, r ∈ N. That is

with step (a) follows by considering only the first term of the infinite summation when z tends
