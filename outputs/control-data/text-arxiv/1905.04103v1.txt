1. Introduction
Kinetic Brownian motion is a purely geometric random perturbation of geodesic motion. In its simplest form, in Rd , the sample paths of kinetic Brownian
motion are C 1 random paths run at unit speed, with velocity a Brownian motion on the unit sphere, run at speed σ 2 , for a speed parameter σ > 0. More
formally, it is a hypoelliptic diffusion with state space Rd × Sd−1 , solution to
the stochastic differential equation
dxσt = vtσ dt,
dvtσ = σ Pvtσ (◦dWt ),
for Pa : Rd → hai⊥ , the orthogonal projection on the orthogonal of hai, for
a 6= 0 in Rd , and W a standard Rd -valued Brownian motion. If σ = 0, we
have a straight line motion with constant velocity. For a fixed 0 < σ < +∞,
we have a C 1 random path, whose typical behavior is illustrated in Figure 1
below.

Figure 1. Brownian motion on the sphere and its integral
path in Rd .
For σ increasing to ∞, the exponentially fast decorrelation of the velocity process v σ on the sphere implies that the process xσ converges to
the constant path x0 , if the latter is fixed independently of σ. One has to
rescale time and look at the evolution at the time scale σ 2 to see a non-trivial
limit. It is indeed elementary to prove that the time rescaled position process

(xσσ2 t )0≤t≤1 of kinetic Brownian motion converges weakly in C [0, 1], Rd to
4
a Brownian motion with generator d(d−1)
∆Rd . See Figure 2 below for an illustration in the setting of the flat 2-dimensional torus. This homogenization
result is in fact valid on a general finite dimensional Riemannian manifold
M , under very mild geometric assumptions. Kinetic Brownian motion on
a d-dimensional
Riemannian manifold M is defined as Cartan development

mσt , ṁσt in the unit tangent bundle T 1 M of M of kinetic Brownian motion in Rd . It is a geodesic for σ = 0, and a C 1 random path for a finite
positive value of σ. It was first proved by X.-M. Li in [Li12] that the timerescaled position process (mσσ2 t )0≤t≤1 converges weakly to Brownian motion
4
with generator d(d−1)
∆M . The manifold M was assumed to be compact and
martingale methods were used to prove that homogenization result. X.-M. Li

extended this result in [Li16] to non-compact manifolds subject to a growth
condition on their curvature tensor. In [ABT15], Angst, Bailleul and Tardif
gave the most general result, assuming only geodesic and stochastic completeness, using rough paths theory as a working horse to transport a rough
path convergence result about kinetic Brownian motion in Rd to the manifold
setting. See also [Li18] for further results in homogeneous spaces, and [Per18]
for a generalization of the homogenization result of [ABT15] to anisotropic
kinetic Brownian motion, or more general Markov processes on T 1 M . Note
that the dynamically obvious convergence of the unrescaled kinetic Brownian
motion to the geodesic motion has been studied from the spectral point of
view in [Dro17], for compact manifolds with negative curvature, showing that
the L2 spectrum of the generator of the unrescaled kinetic Brownian motion
converges to the Pollicott-Ruelle resonances of M . Other examples of homogenization results for Langevin-type processes include works by Hottovy
and co-authors, amongst others; see e.g. [BVW17, HV16, BW18, LWL19] for
quantitative convergence results. See also [Sol95, Kol00, AHK12, Gli11] for
other works on Langevin dynamics in a Riemannian manifold.
This kind of homogenization result certainly echoes Bismut’s program
about his hypoelliptic Laplacian [Bis05, Bis15], whose probabilistic starting
point is a similar interpolation result for Langevin process in Rd and its
Cartan development on a Riemannian manifold. The dynamics is lifted to
a dynamics on the space of differential forms to take advantage of the correspondence between the cohomology of differential forms and homology of
M , via index-type theorems. See [Bis11, Bis15, Bis16, She16] for a sample
of the deep results obtained by Bismut and co-authors on the hypoelliptic
Laplacian.
Note also that kinetic Brownian motion is the Riemannian analogue of
its Lorentzian counterpart, introduced first by Dudley in [Dud66] in Minkowski
spacetime in the 60’s. See the far reaching related works [FLJ07, Bai10,

4

FLJ11, BF12], on relativistic diffusions in a general Lorentzian setting. No
homogenization result is expected for these purely geometric diffusion processes, unless one has an additional non-geometric ingredient, e.g. in the form
of a relativistic fluid flow, like in [AF07].
The object of the present work is to define and study kinetic Brownian motion in the diffeomorphism group M , or volume preserving diffeomorphism group M0 , of a closed Riemannian manifold M . As in the finite
dimensional setting, we prove that it provides an interpolation between the
geodesic flow and a Brownian flow, as the noise intensity parameter σ ranges
from 0 to ∞. For σ = 0, the motion in each diffeomorphism group is geodesic, and it corresponds to the flow of the solutions of Euler’s equation
in the case of M0 , after the seminal works of Arnold [Arn66] and Ebin &
Marsden [EM69]. When considered in the setting of volume preserving diffeomorphisms, the Eulerian picture of kinetic Brownian motion provides a
family of random perturbations of Euler’s equations for the hydrodynamics
of an incompressible fluid. There has been much work recently on random
perturbations of Euler’s equations, following Holm’s seminal article [Hol15].
See [GBH17, CHR18, CFH18, DH18, BdLHLT19] for a sample. The structure
of the noise in these works is intrinsically linked to the group structure of the
diffeomorphism group, and it amounts to perturbe Euler’s equation for the
velocity field by an additive Brownian term, with values in a space of vector
fields on the fluid domain M . Our point of view is purely Riemannian, and
does not appeal to the group structure of the diffeomorphism group of the
fluid domain M . As in the above finite dimensional setting, we define kinetic
Brownian on the diffeomorphism group as the Cartan development of its ‘flat’
counterpart. Unlike the group-oriented point of view, where the running time
diffeomorphism is sufficient to describe its infinitesimal increment from the
noise, we need here a notion of frame of the tangent space of the running
diffeomorphism to build its increment from the noise. We prove that each
component of the energy spectrum of the Eulerian velocity field is ergodic,
and give an explicit description of its invariant measure. We also have an
explicit description of the invariant measure of the energy of the Eulerian
velocity field.
On the technical side, we use rough paths theory to transport a weak
convergence result for the flat kinetic Brownian motion taking values in the
tangent space to the configuration space M , or M0 , to a weak convergence
result for the solution of a differential equation controlled by that flat kinetic
Brownian motion. We use for that purpose the continuity of the Itô-Lyons
solution map to a controlled ordinary differential equation, in the present
infinite dimensional setting. This allows to bypass a number of difficulties that
would appear otherwise if using the classical martingale problem approach,
as in [Li12, Li16]. All we need about rough paths theory is recalled in Section
2.4.
From a geometric point of view, the tangent space to the configuration space can naturally be seen as an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. For

this reason, we define and study in Section 2 kinetic Brownian motion on a
generic infinite dimensional Hilbert space H. We provide an explicit description of the invariant measure of the velocity process in Section 2.1, and we
establish exponential decorrelation identities for the latter in Section 2.2. The
invariance principle for the position process associated to the time-rescaled
H-valued kinetic Brownian motion is then established in Section 2.3. With
the rough paths tools introduced in Section 2.4, Section 2.5 is devoted to the
proof of the fact that the canonical rough path above the time-rescaled position process converges weakly as a rough path to the Stratonovich Brownian
rough path of a Brownian motion with an explicit covariance. Elements of
the geometry of the configuration spaces M and M0 are recalled in Section
3. We develop in particular in Section 3.3 and Section 3.4 the material needed
to talk about Cartan development operation as solving an ordinary differential equation driven by smooth vector fields. The final homogenisation result,
proving the interpolation between geodesic and Brownian flows on the configuration spaces, is proved in Section 4 using the robust tools of rough paths
theory. Appendix A contains the proof of a technical result about Cartan
development in M0 .
Notations. We gather here a number of notations that are used throughout
the article.
• The letter γ stands for a Gaussian measure on a Hilbert space H, with
covariance Cγ : H ∗ × H ∗ → R, and associated operator C γ : H →
H. The scalar product and norm on H are denoted by (·, ·) and k · k,
respectively.
• We denote by H the Cameron-Martin space of the measure γ.
• We endow the algebraic tensor space H ⊗a H with its natural Hilbert
norm. This amounts to identify H ⊗H with the space of Hilbert-Schmidt
operators on H.
• We use the notation A Àp B for an inequality of the form A ≤ cB, with
a constant c depending only on p.

2. Kinetic Brownian motion in a Hilbert space
2.1. Brownian motion on a Hilbert sphere
We first recall basic results on Brownian motion in H, and refer the reader
to the nice lecture notes [Hai12, Str93] for short and detailed accounts.
Recall that a Gaussian probability measure on H is a Borel measure γ
such that `∗ γ is a real Gaussian probability on R, for every continuous linear
functional ` : H → R. Fernique’s theorem [Fer70] ensures that
Z

H

for a small enough positive constant a. It follows that the covariance
Z
Cγ (`, `0 ) := `(x)`0 (x) γ(dx), `, `0 ∈ H ∗
is a well-defined continuous bilinear operator on H ∗ × H ∗ . One can then
define a continuous symmetric operator C γ : H → H, by the identity

C γ (h), k = C(h, k),
for all h, k ∈ H. It has finite trace equal to
Z
tr(C γ ) = kxk2 γ(dx).
Conversely, one can associate to any trace-class symmetric operator C : H →
H, a Gaussian measure γ on H whose covariance Cγ (`, `) = C(`, `), for all
` ∈ H. Since C γ is compact, there exists an orthonormal basis (en ) of H,
such that
C γ (en ) = αn2 en ,
P 2
for non-negative and non-increasing eigenvalues
αn with
αn < ∞. We de
fine a Hilbert space H by choosing αn en as an orthonormal basis for it.
The space H is continuously embeded inside H. Let (X n ) stand for a sequence of independent, identically distributed, real-valued Gaussian random
variables with zero mean and unit variance, defined on some probability space
(Ω, F, P). Then the series

converges in L (Ω, H), and has distribution γ.
Fix a positive time horizon T ∈ (0, ∞]. An H-Brownian motion in H, on
the time interval [0, T ) is a random H-valued continuous path W on [0, T ),
with stationary, independent increments such that the distribution of W1 is a
Gaussian probability measure γ on H. A simple construction is provided by
taking a sequence (Wtn ) of independent, identically distributed, real-valued
Brownian motions, and setting

Denote by S the unit sphere of H, and let
Pa : H → H

Theorem 2.1. The image under the projection u 7→ u/kuk of the measure
1 1
Z kuk γ(du) in the ambiant space H is a probability measure µ on S that is
invariant for the dynamics of vtσ , for any positive speed parameter σ.
This statement generalizes Proposition 1.1 of [Per18] to the present
infinite dimensional setting. The above description of the invariant measure
µ as an image measure under the projection map actually coincides with the
finite dimensional description given in the latter reference.
Proof. When written in Itô form, the stochastic differential equation (1)
defining the process (vtσ )t≥0 reads

As in the finite dimensional anisotropic case treated in [Per18], it is actually
easier to work with an H-valued lift of this S-valued process. We introduce
for that purpose the process (uσt )t≥0 solution of the Stratonovich stochastic
differential equation

A direct application of Itô’s formula then shows that uσ,i
t /kut k satisfies the
σ,i
same stochastic differential equation as vt , for all i, so the two S-valued
processes (vtσ )t≥0 and (uσt /kuσt k)t≥0 have the same distributions. As in the
finite dimensional case, one can then check by a direct computation that the
measure kuk−1 γ(du) on H is invariant for the processes (uσt ); this implies the
statement of Theorem 2.1.

Alternatively, one can bypass computations and argue using Malliavin
calculus as follows. Denote by L the infinitesimal generator of the process
(uσt ). Set V (u) := u/kuk2 for u 6= 0, and let ∆γ denote the Laplace operator
associated with the covariance Cγ with weights (αn2 ),. We then have for any
test function f and any u ∈ H

We prove in Section 2.2 that the velocity process (vtσ ) converges exponentially fast in Wasserstein distance to the invariant probability measure µ
of Theorem 2.1, for any initial velocity v0 , despite the possible lack of strong
Feller property of the associated semigroup. An invariance principle for the
time-rescaled position process (xσσ2 t ) is obtained as a consequence in Section
2.3. We recall in Section 2.4 what we need from rough paths theory in this
work, and prove in Section 2.5 that the canonical rough path associated to the
time-rescaled process (xσσ2 t ) converges weakly as a rough path to an explicit
Stratonovich Brownian rough path.
2.2. Exponential mixing of the velocity process
We consider in this section the mixing properties of the spherical process
(vtσ )t≥0 with unit speed parameter σ = 1. To simplify the expressions, we
drop momentarily the exponents σ from all our notations. Our objective is
to show that the spherical process
(vt )t≥0 = (vt1 )t≥0
is exponentially mixing. Recall that the 1 and 2-Wasserstein distances are
defined for any probability measures µ, ν on S by the identities

where the infimum is taken over all couplings P of X ∼ λ and Y ∼ ν, and the
supremum over all 1-Lipscthiz functions f : S → R. The first two equalities
are definitions, the last one is the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality principle.
Note that W1 ≤ W2 .
Proposition 2.2. Assume that
3α02 < tr(C γ ).

There exists a positive time τ such that for any probability measures λ and ν
on the unit sphere S of H, we have
W2 (Pt∗ λ, Pt∗ ν) ≤ e−t/τ W2 (λ, ν),
for all t ≥ 0. In particular, the invariant measure µ is unique, and for any
probability measure λ on the sphere S, and t ≥ 0, we have
W2 (Pt∗ λ, µ) ≤ 2e−t/τ .

(4)

The role of the trace condition (21) will be clear from the proof. If we
have the freedom to choose the covariance Cγ of the Brownian noise, this is
not a constraint. Note that the rougher the noise, that is the more slowly
the sequence of the eigenvalues αn converges to 0, the easier it is to satisfy
condition (21). We shall see in Section 4 that it holds automatically in a
number of relevant examples of random dynamics in the configuration space
of a fluid flow.
Proof. Denote by P the law of the Brownian motion (Bt ) with covariance Cγ ,
and by Pv the law of the solution of Equation (1) with σ = 1, starting from
v ∈ S. Denote by E and Ev the associated expectations operators. Recall
that the notation (a, b) stands for the scalar product of a and b in H. Fix
v0 , w0 ∈ S, and consider the two diffusion processes (vt ) and (wt ), started
from v0 and w0 , respectively, and solutions of the Itô stochastic differential
equations

law Pw0 . Moreover, Itô’s formula yields

or equivalently, setting

for any v ∈ S. Taking the expectation under P in equation (5), we have from
Grönwall inequality

E[Nt ] ≤ e−t(tr(Cγ )−3α0 ) E[N0 ],
that is

2

E[kvt − wt k2 ] ≤ e−t(tr(Cγ )−3α0 ) kx − yk2 .
The conclusion of the statement follows.



Remark that Eµ [vt ] = 0, as a consequence of the symmetry properties
of the invariant measure µ.
Corollary 2.3. For any v0 ∈ S, we have
Ev0 [vt ] ≤ 2e−t/τ .
The process (vt ) is stationary if v0 has distribution µ; it can then be
extended into a two sided process defined for all real times. Denote by (Ft )t∈R
the complete filtration generated by (vt ) on the probability
 space where it is
defined. Set F≤0 := σ Ft ; t ≤ 0 and F≥s := σ Ft ; t ≥ s , for any real time
s. Recall that the mixing coefficient α(s) of the velocity process v is defined,
for s > 0, by the formula
α(s) :=

sup

P(A ∩ B) − P(A)P(B) .

A∈F≤0 ,B∈F≥s

The following fact will be useful to get for free the independence of the increments of the limit processes obtained after proper rescalings of functionals of
(vt ).
Corollary 2.4. The mixing coefficient α(s) tends to 0 as s increases to ∞.
Proof. As a preliminary remark, recall the definition of the lift (uσt ) to H of
(vtσ ), introduced in the proof of Theorem 2.1. This process is strong Feller,
as it can be seen to satisfy a Bismut-Li integration by parts formula. See e.g.
Peszat and Zabczyk’ seminal paper [PZ95], and Wang and Zhang’s extension [WZ10] to unbounded drift and diffusivity. The velocity process (vtσ ) is
thus itself a strong Feller diffusion, and if one denotes by (Pt ) its transition
semigroup, the functions P1 g, for g measurable, bounded by 1, are all Lipschitz continuous, with a finite common upper bound L for their Lipschitz
constants.
Now, it follows from the Markovian character of the dynamics of (vt ),
and the Feller property of its semigroup, that it suffices to see that


E f (v0 )g(vs )
(6)
tends to 0 as s goes to ∞, for any real-valued continuous functions f, g on
the unit sphere S, with null mean with respect to the invariant measure µ.
Writing further

E f (v0 )E g(vs )|vs1 = E f (v0 ) (P1 g)(vs−1 ) ,

diffusion process (vt ), we can further assume that the function g in (6) is

2.3. Invariance principle for the position process
We assume in all of this section that the initial condition v0 of the velocity
process of kinetic Brownian motion is distribued according to its invariant
probability measure µ, from Theorem 2.1.
Pick 1/3 < α ≤ 1/2. We prove in this section that the distribution
in C α ([0, 1], H) of the time-rescaled position process (xσσ2 t ) converges to the
distribution of a Brownian motion in H with an explicit covariance, given
in identity (7) of Proposition 2.5 below. The usual invariance principles in
Hilbert spaces consider weak convergence in C 0 ([0, 1], H), so we need an
extra tightness estimate provided in Section 2.3.1 to complete the program.
To make the most out of the convergence results from Section 2.2, set
Xtσ := xσσ2 t ;
we have

the process (Xtσ ) converges as σ goes to ∞ to the Brownian motion on H

this sequence to martingale differences. There is an abundant literature on
the subject; we follow here the approach of C. Cuny [Cun17].
Let (Ω, F, P) be a probability space with a filtration (Fn )n≥n0 , where

2.3.2. Convergence in Hölder spaces. We are ready to prove Proposition 2.5
on the weak convergence of X σ in any Hölder space C α ([0, 1], H) to the
Brownian motion in H with covariance given by formula (7).
Proof of Proposition 2.5. From the tightness result in C α ([0, 1], H) stated
in Proposition 2.6, it is sufficient to show that X σ converges weakly in
C 0 ([0, 1], H) to the above mentionned Brownian motion. If suffices for that
purpose to see that for a finite sequence of t1 < · · · < tn , and a small
enough positive delay , the random variables Xtσi − − Xtσi−1 converge to
finitely many independent Gaussian random variables, with corresponding
covariances (ti −  − ti−1 ) times the covariance (7). One can for instance use
Dedecker and Merlevède conditional central limit theorem, from Theorem 1
in [DM03], to see the convergence to a Gaussian limit with the expected covariance operator. One checks that the four conditions (a)-(d) from Theorem
1 in [DM03] hold true in our setting. We denote by ` ∈ H ∗ a continuous
linear form on H.

converges indeed to
P a finite limite as T goes to ∞. This limit is given
by the finite sum i≥0 β`2i , where (`i ) stands for an orthonormal basis
of H ∗ .
One reads the independence of the limit Gaussian random variables corresponding to different time intervals [ti−1 , ti − ] on their null correlation; the
latter is a direct consequence of the decorrelation property of Corollary 2.3.
The statement of Proposition 2.5 follows then from the conclusion of Dedecker
and Merlevède convergence result. The identification of the covariance (7) is
a consequence of the corresponding statement, Proposition 3.4, in the finite
dimensional setting of [Per18].

We aim now at improving the weak invariance principle of Proposition
2.5 into a weak invariance principle for the canonical rough path associated
with X σ . This will be crucial in Section 4 when defining kinetic Brownian
motion in a diffeomorphism space as the solution of a differential equation
driven by X σ , and proving the interpolation results of Theorem 4.3 and
Theorem 4.4 by a continuity argument. We recall in the next section all we
need to know from rough paths theory.
2.4. The flavor of rough paths theory
It is not our purpose here to give a detailled account of rough paths theory.
We refer the reader to the lecture notes [CLL07, FH14, Bau14, Bai15b], for
introductions to the subject from different point of views. The following will
be sufficient for our needs here.
Rough paths theory is a theory of ordinary differential equations

controlled by non-smooth signals h ∈ C α ([0, 1], R` ). The point zt moves here
in Rd , where we are given sufficiently regular vector fields Vi . Young
R · integration theory [You36, Lyo94] allows to make sense of the integral 0 V (ys )dhs ,

path depending in locally Lipscthiz way on y and h. This allows to formulate the differential equation (9) as a fixed point problem for a contracting map from C α ([0, 1], Rd ) into itself, and to obtain as a consequence the
continuous dependence of the solution path on the driving control h. LyonsYoung theory cannot be used for α-Hölder controls with α < 12 , as even in
R, with one dimensional controls, there exists no continuous bilinear
form
R1
on C α ([0, 1], R) × C α ([0, 1], R) extending the Riemann integral 0 yt dht , of
smooth paths y, h; see Propositon 1.29 of [CLL07]. (This can be understood from a Fourier analysis point of view as a consequence of the fact
that the resonant operator from Littlewood-Paley theory is unbounded on
C α ([0, 1], R) × C α−1 ([0, 1], R), when 2α − 1 < 0; see [BCD11].) Lyons’ deep
insight was to realize that what really fixes the dynamics of a solution path
to the controlled differential equation (9) is not only the increments dht , or
ht − hs , of the control, but rather the increments of h together with the increments of a number of its iterated integrals. This can be understood from
the fact that for a smooth control, one has the Taylor-type expansion

for any smooth real-valued function f on Rd , and any times 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ 1.
The above O(·) term is allowed to depend on f . Importantly, the solution of a rough differential equation driven by the Stratonovich Brownian
rough path coincides almost surely with the solution of the corresponding
Stratonovich differential equation; see e.g. the lecture notes [FH14, Bai].
Theorem 2.11 (Lyons’ universal limit theorem). The rough differential equation (10) has a unique solution. It is an element of C 1/p ([0, 1], Rd ) that depends continuously on X.
The map that associates to the driving rough path the solution to a
given rough differential equation, seen as an element of C 1/p ([0, 1], Rd ), is
called the Itô-Lyons solution map. If (Xn ) is a sequence of random geometric
p-rough path in R` , converging weakly to a limit random geometric p-rough
path X, the continuity of the Itô-Lyons solution map gives for free the weak
convergence in C 1/p ([0, 1], Rd ) of the laws of the solutions to Equation (10)
driven by the Xn , to the law of the solution of that equation driven by X.
The theory works perfectly well for dynamics with values in Banach
spaces or Banach manifolds, and driving rough paths X = (X, X), with X
taking values in a Banach space E. One needs to take care in that setting
to the tensor norm used to define the completion of the algebraic tensor
space E ⊗a E, as this may produce non-equivalent norms, and that norm is
used to define the norm of a rough path. Note that families of vector fields
(V1 , . . . , V` ) are then replaced in that setting by one forms on E with values
in the space of vector fields on the space where the dynamics takes place. See
e.g. Lyons’ original work [Lyo98] or Cass and Weidner’s work [CW16] for the
details. See e.g. [Bai15a] for a simple proof of Lyons’ universal limit theorem
in that general setting.
The vector fields in Definition 2.10 and Theorem 2.11 are required to
be Cb3 . This is used to get solution of equation (10) that are defined on the
whole time interval [0, 1]. Only local in time existence results can be obtained
when working with unbounded vector fields, or on a manifold. The Taylorlike expansion property (11) defining a solution path is then only required
to hold for each time s, for t sufficiently close to s. One still has continuity
of the solution path with respect to the driving rough path, in an adapted
sense. See e.g. Section 2.4.2 of [ABT15]. This continuity property is sufficient
to obtain the local weak convergence of the laws of the solution path to
the corresponding limit path, for random driving weak geometric p-rough
paths converging weakly to a limit random weak geometric p-rough path.
See Definition 4.2 for the definition of local weak convergence.
So far, we have defined kinetic Brownian motion (xσt , vtσ ) in H from
its unit velocity process v σ . We have seen in Proposition 2.5 that its time
rescaled position process (Xtσ ) := (xσσ2 t ) is converging weakly in C α [0, 1], H

20

J. Angst, I. Bailleul and P. Perruchaud

to a Brownian motion with explicit covariance (7), for any α < 1/2. We
prove in the next section that the canonical rough path Xσ associated with
X σ converges weakly as a weak geometric p-rough path to the Stratonovich
Brownian rough path associated with the Brownian motion with covariance
(7), for any 2 < p < 3. This convergence result will be instrumental in
Section 4 to prove that the Cartan development in diffeomorphism spaces of
the time rescaled kinetic Brownian motion in Hilbert spaces of vector fields
converge to some limit dynamics as σ increases to ∞. This will come as a
direct consequence of the continuity of the Itô-Lyons solution map.
Remark 2.12. The idea of using rough paths theory for proving elementary
homogenization results was first tested in the work [FGL13] of Friz, Gassiat
and Lyons, in their study of the so-called physical Brownian motion in a
magnetic field. That random process is described as a C 1 path (xt )0≤t≤1 in
Rd modeling the motion of an object of mass m, with momentum p = mẋ,
subject to a damping force and a magnetic field. Its momentum satisfies a
stochastic differential equation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck form
dpt = −

1
M pt dt + dBt ,
m

for some matrix M , whose eigenvalues all have positive real parts, and B is a
d-dimensional Brownian motion. While the process (M xt )0≤t≤1 is easily seen
to converge to a Brownian motion W , its rough path lift is shown to converge
in a rough paths sense in Lq , for any q ≥ 2, to a random rough path different
from the Stratonovich Brownian rough path associated to W .
A number of works have followed this approach to homogenization problems for fast-slow systems; see [ABT15, KM16, KM17, BC17, CFK+ 19] for
a sample.
2.5. Rough paths invariance principle for the canonical lift
As in Section 2.3, we assume in all of this section that the initial condition
v0 of the velocity process of kinetic Brownian motion is distribued according
to its invariant probability measure µ, from Theorem 2.1.
Let Xσ = (X σ , Xσ ) stand for the canonical rough path associated to
the random C 1 path X σ , where we recall that

It follows in particular from Proposition 2.6, Lemma 2.13 and the known
Kolmogorov-Lamperti criterion for rough paths that the family of laws L(Xσ )
is tight in RP(α−1 ), for any 1/3 < α < 1/2.

Proof. Let G2d stand for the step-2 nilpotent Lie group over Rd . We prove
that the process (Xt0 )0≤t≤1 is a G2d -valued Brownian motion by showing
that it has stationary, independent, increments. The stationarity is inherited
from the stationarity of the Xσ . The independence of the increments of X on
disjoint closed intervals is a consequence of Corollary 2.4 on the convergence
to 0 of the mixing coefficient of (vt ). Continuity of X allows to extend the
result to adjacent time intervals.
We identify the generator of the G2d -valued Brownian motion (Xt ) as the
generator of the d-dimensional Stratonovich Brownian rough path following
the method of [Per18]. We recall the details for the reader’s convenience. Note
that we only need to consider the joint dynamics of B t and the antisymmetric
part (At ) of (Xt ); the former takes values in the Lie algebra g2d of G2d – a linear
space. Denote by AB the antisymmetric part of Stratonovich Brownian rough
path associated with B. We then have, for any smooth real-valued function

3. Geometry of the configuration space
3.1. Configuration space
Let (M, g) be a d-dimensional connected and oriented Riemannian manifold,
and π : F → M a finite dimensional fiber bundle over M , with vertical bundle
V F → M . Think of the trivial bundles M × M → M , or M × T M → M ,
as typical examples. We collect from Palais’ seminal work [Pal68] elementary
results on the Hilbert manifold H s (F ) of sections of π with Sobolev regularity
exponent s > d2 .
1. Sobolev embedings hold true, with in particular H s (F ) ⊂ C k (M, F ), if
s > k + d2 and k ≥ 0.
2. Variations of H s -sections of F . The spaces T H s (F ) and H s (V F ) are
isomorphic as Hilbert manifolds. This isomorphism accounts for the
fact that an infinitesimal perturbation (δf ) of a section f of F , reads
as a collection of vertical tangent vectors (δf )(x) ∈ Vf (x) F , indexed by

Kinetic Brownian motion in configuration space

25

x ∈ M . As a particular example, for any finite dimensional manifold N ,
the spaces T H s (M, N ) and H s (M, T N ) are isomorphic.
3. For any two finite dimensional fiber bundles F, G above M , the map

(f, g) 7→ x ∈ M 7→ (f (x), g(x))
is an isomorphism between H s (F ) × H s (G) and H s (F ×M G).
4. Omega lemma. Given a smooth fiber bundle morphism Φ : F → G,
above M , set
ωΦ (f ) := Φ ◦ f,
for any section f of F . Then ωΦ sends H s (F ) in H s (G), and dωΦ :
T H s (F ) → T H s (G) is isomorphic to ωdΦ : H s (V F ) → H s (V G), via
the isomorphisms T H s (F ) ' H s (V F ) and T H s (F 0 ) ' H s (V G).
For s > d2 , set

M := H s (M, M );
this will be the configuration space of our dynamics. Choosing s > d2 , ensures
that M ⊂ C 0 (M, M ), by Sobolev embedings. The tangent space to this
Hilbert manifold is given by
T M ' H s (M, T M ),
from item 2 above. If s > d2 +1, elements of M are C 1 maps from M into itself.
Recall in that case from Section 4 of [EM69] that the subset M0 of M of H s
maps from M into itself that preserve the volume form by pull-back is then
a closed submanifold of M , and that elements of M0 are diffeomorphisms.
So M0 is a group. We shall always assume implicitly these constraints on
the regularity exponent s, when talking about M or M0 . We recall other
elementary facts on H s (T M ) at the end of this section.
To implement a version of Cartan’s development machinery in the weak
Riemannian setting of the next section, we introduce the following finite
dimensional fiber bundles above M , seen below as the first component. Given
x, y ∈ M , denote by O(Tx M, Ty M ) the set of isometries from Tx M to Ty M .
Set

F (e) := (x, y; e) ; (x, y) ∈ M × M, e ∈ O(Tx M, Ty M ) ,

F (e,v) := x, y; e, v ; (x, y) ∈ M × M, e ∈ O(Tx M, Ty M ), v ∈ Ty M .



induces a smooth map from H s (F (w,e) ) into H s (F (v) ). Similarly, the smooth

x, y; e, v 7→ x, y; e−1 (v) ,
induces a smooth map from H s (F (e,v) ) into H s (F (w) ).
We refer the reader to the classic textbook [Ros97] for the following
elementary facts from functional analysis about the Laplace operator ∆ on
vector fields on M . We take the convention that −∆ is a non-positive symmetric operator on L2 (T M ). This operator has compact resolvant, so one has
an eigenspaces decomposition

3.2. Weak Riemannian structure on the configuration space
Denote by Vol the Riemannian volume measure on (M, g), and by exp :
T M → M , its exponential map. The configuration space M is endowed with a
smooth weak Riemannian structure, setting for any ϕ ∈ M and X(ϕ), Y (ϕ) ∈
Tϕ M ,
Z


gϕ(m) X(ϕ)(m), Y (ϕ)(m) Vol(dm).
(14)
X(ϕ), Y (ϕ) ϕ :=
M

This formula defines by restriction a weak Riemannian metric on the space
M0 of H s maps from M into itself preserving the volume form. In that
setting, notice that if X(ϕ) = X ◦ ϕ and Y (ϕ) = Y ◦ ϕ, for some vector fields
X, Y on M , then the change of variable formula gives
Z


X(ϕ), Y (ϕ) ϕ =
gm X(m), Y(m) Vol(dm),
M

so the scalar product is in that case the L2 scalar product of the vector fields
X and Y. The fact that the topology on M induced by the scalar product is
weaker than the H s -topology makes non-obvious the existence of a smooth
Levi-Civita connection. Ebin and Marsden have proved that
• the L2 metric (14) is a smooth function on M ,
• it has a smooth Levi-Civita connection ∇, with associated exponential map Exp well-defined and smooth in a neighbourhood of the zero
section; it is explicitly given by

Expϕ (X)(m) = expϕ(m) X(m) .
The geodesics of (M , ∇) are defined for all times. Denote by ∇ the LeviCivita connection of (M, g). For smooth right invariant vector fields X, Y on
M , with X(ϕ) = X ◦ ϕ and Y (ϕ) = Y ◦ ϕ, one has
(∇X Y )(ϕ) = (∇X Y) ◦ ϕ.
The L2 -scalar product is right invariant on the group M0 , from the change of
variable formula. The Levi-Civita connection of the L2 metric on the volume
preserving configuration space M0 is explicitly given in terms of the Hodge
projection operator P on divergence-free vector fields on M . Denote by Rϕ
the right composition by ϕ. For any ϕ ∈ M0 , the map
−1
Pϕ := dRϕ ◦ P ◦ dRϕ
,

(15)

is indeed the orthogonal projection map from Tϕ M into Tϕ M0 , and its de0
pends smoothly on ϕ ∈ M0 . So the Levi-Civita connection ∇ on M0 is given
by
0

∇ = P ◦ ∇;
it is a smooth map. Its associated exponential map is no longer given by the
exponential map on T M , due to the non-local volume preserving constraint.
Geodesics are not defined for all times anymore. Denote by Id the identity

X ◦ ϕ and Y (ϕ) = Y ◦ ϕ, for vector fields X, Y on M , one has



∇X Y (Id) = P ∇X Y .
V.I. Arnol’d showed formally in his seminal work [Arn66] that the velocity
field u : [0, T ] → H s (T M ) of a geodesic ϕt in M0 , with ut := ϕ̇t ◦ ϕ−1
t , is
a solution to Euler’s equation for the hydrodynamics of an incompressible
fluid. Ebin and Marsden gave an analytical proof of that fact in their seminal work [EM69]. (Besides that classical reference, we refere the reader to
Arnold and Khesin’s book [AK98], or Smolentsev’s thourough review [Smo07]
for reference works on the weak Riemannian geometry of the configuration
space.)
The flat two-dimensional torus T2 offers an interesting concrete example. Its symplectic structure allows to identify a Hilbert basis (Ak , Bk )k∈Z2 \0
of TId M0 from an eigenbasis for the Laplace operator on real-valued functions on T2 ; see e.g. Arnold and Khesin’s book [AK98], Section 7 of Chap. 1.
Denote by ∂1 , ∂2 the constant vector fields in the coordinate directions, and
k = (k1 , k2 ) ∈ Z2 . One has


Ak = |k|−1 k2 cos(k · θ)∂1 − k1 cos(k · θ)∂2 ,

Bk = |k|−1 k2 sin(k · θ)∂1 − k1 sin(k · θ)∂2 .
One can see in the following simulations the image of axis circles by the time 1
map of the associated flow in T2 , corresponding to different inital conditions
for u0 , with ϕ0 = Id. The simulations were done using an elementary finite
dimensional approximation for the dynamics, using the explicit expressions
for the Christoffel symbols first given by Arnold in [Arn66]. We come back

to this point in Section 3.4.
3.3. Parallel transport
We recast in this section the parallel transport operations in M and M0 ,
using the bundles F from Section 3.1. This allows to set the notations for the
next section on Cartan development operation in M and M0 . Recall H s (F )
stands for H s sections from M into the corresponding bundle F . We denote

Kinetic Brownian motion in configuration space

29

by V F the vertical space in T F , for the canonical projection map F → M .
Recall also that TId M is simply the set of H s vector fields on M .
Denote by K : T T M → T M , the connector associated with the LeviCivita connection ∇ on M . So, for a path γt = (mt , vt ) in T M , one has
∇ṁt vt = K(γ̇t ),
and

∇X Y = K (dY)(X) ,
for any smooth vector fields X, Y on M . The second order tangent bundle
T T M of M identifies with H s (M, T T M ). The connector K associated with
the L2 -Levi-Civita connection ∇ is given, for a section Y of T T M over an
element of M , by
K(Y ) := K ◦ Y ∈ T M .
Denote by V2 F (v) the vertical space in T F (v) for the canonical projection
map
p2 : F (v) → M × M.
One defines a smooth one form on V2 F (v) , with values in T F (v) , by requiring
that ∇ẏt vt = 0 iff
d
(yt , vt ) = H(v) (yt , vt ; ẏt ).
dt
We choose the letter H, for this horizontal lift of the connection. In simple
terms, for any fixed (y, v) ∈ T M , the linear map H(v) (y, v; ·) identifies the
space Ty M to the horizontal subspace of T(y,v) T M , via the usual horizontal
lift. Note that the definition of H(v) (y, v; ẏ) does not depend on the base point
x ∈ M , for a generic element (x, y; v) ∈ F (v) and ẏ ∈ Ty M .
Denote also by H(e) the smooth one form on V2 F (v) with values in the
space of vector field on F (e) , such that for any path (x, yt ; et ) in F (e) , and
any vector w ∈ Tx M , the vector et (w) ∈ Tyt M is transported parallely along
the M -valued path (yt ) iff
d
(yt , et ) = H(e) (yt , et ; ẏt ).
dt
Here again, the base point x ∈ M is not involved in the definition of the
tangent vector H(e) (y, e; ẏ), for a generic element (x, y; e) ∈ F (e) and ẏ ∈
Ty M . Pick
(x0 , y0 ; e0 ) ∈ F (e) ,
and note that for any vertical vector
(ẏ, ė) ∈ V(x0 ,y0 ;e0 ) F (e) ,
and v0 ∈ Ty0 M , one has
(ẏ, ė) = H(e) y0 , e0 ; v0

3.4. Cartan and Lie developments
Cartan’s moving frame method [Car01] provides a mechanics for constructing C 1 paths on M from C 1 path on Rd , giving something of a chart on
pathspace in M . Its description requires the introduction of the orthonormal
frame bundle OM over M . It is made up of pairs z = (m, e), with m ∈ M
and e an isometry from Rd to Tm M . It has a natural finite dimensional manifold structure, and the Riemannian connection on T M induces vector fields
H1 , . . . , Hd on OM by parallel transport of a frame in the direction of its ith
direction along the corresponding path in M . The development in M of a
path (xt )0≤t≤1 in Rd is the natural projection (mt ) in M of the OM -valued
path (zt ) solution to the equation
żt = H(zt )(ẋt ).
Explosion may happen before time 1. This path in M depends not only on
m0 but also on e0 . Conversely, given any C 1 path (mt )0≤t≤1 in M and z0 =
(m0 , e0 ) ∈ OM above m0 , parallel transport of e0 along the path (mt )0≤t≤1
Rt
defines a path (zt )0≤t≤1 in OM , and setting xt := 0 e−1
s (ṁs ) ds, defines a
path in Rd whose Cartan development is (mt )0≤t≤1 . Geodesics are Cartan’s
development of straight lines in Rd .

Figure 5. For z ∈ OM and a = (a1 , . . . , ad ) ∈ Rd , we have
Pd
H(z)(a) := i=1 ai Hi (z) ∈ Tz OM .
We recast the definition of Cartan development given above in a finite
dimensional setting in the following form well suited for the present infinite
dimensional setting.
Definition 3.4. Let a C 1 path (Xt ) in TId M be given. An M -valued path (ϕt )
is the Cartan development of (Xt ) if there exists a family
et : TId M → Tϕt M ,
of bounded linear maps, with e0 = id, such that
ϕ̇t = et (Ẋt ),
∇ϕ̇t et (Y) = 0,

for all Y ∈ TId M ,

(17)

at all times where ϕt is well-defined.
This definition conveys the same picture as above. The map et , named
‘frame’, is transported parallely along the path (ϕt ), while ϕ̇t is given by
the image by et of Ẋt . The existence of a unique Cartan development for a
path (Xt ) in TId M is elementary in that case. It follows from Proposition
3.2

that equation (17) is equivalent to requiring that the H s F (e) -valued path
(ϕt , et ) satisfies the equation

d
e
(ϕt , et ) = H ϕt , et ; Ẋt .
(18)
dt
e
Since the one-form H is smooth, this equation has a unique solution until
its possibly finite explosion time.
Here is now the form of Cartan development dynamics in M0 . Recall
TId M0 is the set of H s divergence-free vector fields on M .
Definition 3.5. Let a C 1 path (Xt ) in TId M0 be given. An M0 -valued path
(ϕt ) is the Cartan development of (Xt ) if there exists a family
et : TId M0 → Tϕt M0 ,

ϕ̇t = et (Ẋt ),

∇ϕ̇t et (Y) = 0,

for all Y ∈ TId M0 ,

(19)

at all times where ϕt is well-defined.
The proof of existence of a unique solution to Cartan’s development
system (19) in M0 is not fundamentally different from the case of M , and
uses Proposition 3.3 instead of Proposition 3.2. It is however more technical,
and full details are given in Appendix A. The system is recast as a controlled
ordinary differential equation in the state space

driven by a smooth vector field-valued one form on TId M0 . We use Cartan’s
development map in the configuration manifolds M and M0 in the next
section. We conclude this section by a brief comparison between Cartan development and the Lie group notion of development, commonly used to define
the stochastic Euler equation.
Let G stand for a finite dimensional Lie group with Lie algebra Lie(G).
Lie’s development operation provides another way of constructing paths
(gt )0≤t≤1
with values in G from paths (xt )0≤t≤1 in Rd , by identifying Tg0 G and Rd via
a linear map ι0 , and solving the ordinary differential equation
ġt = ι0 (ẋt ) gt .
In such a group setting, Malliavin and Airault [AM02] gave a correspondance between the Cartan and Lie notions of development, although this
was certainly known to practitioners before; see also [CFM07]. Choose an
orthonormal basis of the Lie algebra of G, and denote by cnk,` the structure

constants, so the Christoffel symbols are given by Γnk,` = 21 cnk,` − ck`,n + c`n,k .
Write Γk for the antisymmetric endomorphism with matrix Γ·k,· in the chosen
basis, for 1 ≤ k ≤ d, and consider Γ as a linear map from Rd into the set
of antisymmetric endomorphism of the Lie algebra. Denote by OLie(G) the
orthonormal group of Lie(G).
Proposition 3.6. Let (wt )0≤t≤1 be a C 1 path
 in the Lie algebra of G. The path
(gt )0≤t≤1 solution to the OLie(G) × G -valued equation
dOt := Ot Γ(ẇt ) dt,
dgt = Ot (ẇt )gt ,

is the Cartan development of the path (wt ).
(The system (20) is reminiscent of the equation in

H s (F (e) ) × L H s (T M )
from Appendix A, recasting Cartan’s development dynamics in M0 .) The
geodesic started from the identity of G, with direction ω ∈ Lie(G), is in
particular given in the Lie picture as the solution (gt )0≤t≤1 to the equation

ġt = exp tΓ(ω) (ω) gt .

Note that exp tΓ(ω) (ω) ∈ Lie(G). Note also that it is the fact that the
Christoffel symbols are constants that allows to reduce the second order differential equation for the geodesics on a generic Riemannian manifold into a
first order differential equation, in a Riemannian Lie group setting.
Following Euler’s picture, it is this group-oriented point of view that has
been considered so far in the geometric viewpoint on fluid hydrodynamics,
deterministic or stochastic. The naive implementation of Cartan’s machinery
in terms of Lie development runs into trouble in the infinite dimensional setting of M or M0 . This can be seen on the example of the two dimensional
torus and the volume preserving diffeomorphism group as a consequence of
the fact that Christoffel symbols define antisymmetric unbounded operators
that have no good exponential in the orthonormal group of TId M0 . The problem comes from the fact that M of M0 have a fixed regularity. See Malliavin’s
works [Mal99, CFM07] for a quantification of the loss of regularity of Brownian motion in the set of homeomorphisms of the circle, as time increases.
The Lie development picture of Cartan’s development map can however be
used for numerical purposes for simulating kinetic Brownian motion in M0 .
It corresponds to having ẇt a Brownian motion on the unit sphere of the H s
space of divergence-free vector fields on M ; see Section 4.

4.1. Kinetic Brownian motion in M
Set H := H s (T M ). Pick another exponent a > 21 , and let H stand for the

inherited from the eigenspace decomposition (13) of L2 (T M ). Let ι stand for
the continuous inclusion of H into H. The continuous symmetric operator
ιι∗ : H → H, is trace-class, as a consequence of Weyl’s law on a closed
manifold, so it is the covariance of an H-valued Brownian motion W . Note
the correspondance C = ιι∗ , and
αn2 = |λn |−a ,

with the notations of Section 2.1. We assume that the trace condition
3α12 < tr(C),

(21)

holds true. Note that the faster λi goes to ∞, the lesser there is noise in W .
The extreme case corresponds to only finitely many non-null αi . On the other
extreme, the bigger the multiplicity of α12 is, the more noise there is in W .
The trace condition (21) holds automatically as soon as α12 has multiplicity
three.
The Brownian motion vtσ on the sphere S of H, associated with the
injection H ,→ H, is defined as the solution to the stochastic differential
equation
dvtσ = σ Pvtσ (◦dWt ),
where Pa : H → H, is the orthogonal projection on hai⊥ , for any a 6= 0, and

This equation is only locally well-posed. We introduce the following

solutions of random or stochastic differential equations. Add a cemetary point
† to H s (F (e) ), and endow the disjoint union H s (F (e) ) t {†} with its natural

{†}, that start from a reference point z0 := (Id, e0 ) above the identity map
on M W
, and that stay at the cemetery point †, if it leaves H s (F (e) ). Let
F := t∈[0,1] Ft where (Ft )0≤t≤1 stands for the filtration generated by the
canonical coordinate process on pathspace. Let BR stand for the H s balls
with center z0 and radius R, for any R > 0. The first exit time from BR is
denoted by τR , and used to define a measurable map

The motion of ϕt itself is not given as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. This happens already in finite dimension, when defining
anisotropic Brownian motion on a d-dimensional Riemannian manifold M as
Cartan development of an anisotropic Brownian motion in Rd . One needs the
moving orthonormal frame attached to the running point on M , to define the
position increment in M from the increment of the driving anisotropic Brownian motion in Rd . The motion in M is in particular non-Markovian, while the
motion in OM is Markovian. The same phenomenon happens in the present
infinite dimensional setting, and we do not get here classical semimartingale
flows in H s (M, M ) [Kun90], or Brownian flows in critical spaces, such as in
Malliavin’s work on the canonical Brownian motion on the diffeomorphism
group of the circle [Mal99, Fan02, AR02].
We remark here that the stochastic homogenization methods that X.M. Li used in [Li16] to prove the homogenization result for kinetic Brownian
motion in a finite dimensional, complete, Riemannian manifold, require a
positive injectivity radius and a uniform control on the gradient of the distance function over the whole manifold. It is unclear that anything like that
is available in the present infinite dimensional setting, or in the setting of
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms investigated in the next section, especially given the fact that M or M0 have infinite negative curvature in some

Kinetic Brownian motion in configuration space

directions. The robust pathwise approach of rough paths allows to circumvent
these potential issues.
4.2. Kinetic Brownian motion in M0
Let H0 stand for the closed subspace of H of divergence-free vector fields
on the fluid domain M . It is the tangent space at the identity map of the
closed submanifold M0 of M of diffeomorphisms that leave invariant the
Riemannian volume form of M . The intersection H0s+a of Hs+a with H0 , is
continuously embedded into H0 . If ι0 stands for this injection, the continuous
symmetric operator ι0 ι∗0 : H0 → H0 , is trace-class, so it is the covariance of
an H0 -valued Brownian motion W . The spectrum of C 0 := ι0 ι∗0 is explicit
in the example of the 2-dimensional torus, with maximal eigenvalue 1, with
multiplicity 4. The trace condition (21) thus holds true for any a > 21 , in that
case. Similarly, the spectrum of the Laplacian operator on vector fields on the
2-dimensional sphere is obtained from the spectrum of the Laplacian operator
on real-valued functions on the 2-sphere, as a consequence of its canonical
symplectic structure [AS89, Yos97]. Eigenvectors are constant multiples of
the complex spherical harmonics, so eigenvalues have multiplicity at least
two. Here as well, symmetry properties of the 2-dimensional sphere imply
that they have actually multiplicity four, so the trace condition (21) holds
for free. More generally, divergence-free vector fields on a simply connected ddimensional manifold M are gradients of functions, so one gets the spectrum
of the covariance operator C from the spectrum of the Laplacian operator on
real-valued functions on M . One needs to assume the trace condition (21) in
this generality.
Kinetic Brownian motion (xσt , vtσ ) in H0 is defined as above from the
associated Brownian motion (vtσ ) on the sphere S0 of H0 , and its integral.
We prove in Theorem A.3 of Appendix A that the Cartan development ϕσt
in M0 , of the time rescaled kinetic Brownian motion in H0 is the M0 -part of
the solution (ϕσt , eσt , ftσ ), to a controlled ordinary differential equation on

Here again, one can rewrite that equation as a rough differential equation
driven by the canonical rough path Xσ above the time rescalled position
process of kinetic Brownian motion in H0 . The continuity of the Itô-Lyons
solution map then gives the following theorem.
Theorem 4.4. The M0 -valued part (ϕσt ) of kinetic Brownian motion in Z is
converging locally weakly to the projection (ϕt ) on M0 of a Z -valued Brownian motion.

38

J. Angst, I. Bailleul and P. Perruchaud

Here again, the dynamics of ϕσt is non-Markovian. Note that since kinetic Brownian motion on M0 is defined by Cartan development, using the
L2 metric (14), the L2 -size of ϕ̇σt is equal to the L2 -norm of vtσ . The metric
being right invariant on the group M0 , the Eulerian velocity
uσt := ϕ̇σt ◦ (ϕσt )−1 ,
also has the same L2 -norm as vtσ . The latter is not preserved a priori; neither
is the H s -norm of uσt , as mentioned above after Proposition 3.6.
Denote by Q0 the quadratic form on H s (T M ), with matrix

diag |λn |−s n≥0 ,
in the orthonormal basis of H s (T M ) associated with the eigenvector decomposition (13) for −∆ on L2 (T M ). For each v in the unit sphere S of H s (T M ),
one has Q0 (v) = kvk2L2 , and
kvk2L2 ≤ λ−s
0 kvkH s .
Since the S-valued diffusion (vtσ ) is ergodic, each component (vtσ )n of vtσ , in

the decomposition (13), is an ergodic process in the interval −λn , λn

σ
The squared L -norm of vt is also an ergodic process in the interval (0, λ0 ).
It has invariant measure the image of a constant multiple of the measure with
density 1/kuk with respect to the Gaussian measure in H with covariance
ι0 ι∗0 , by the map

u ∈ H 7→ Q0 u/kuk ,
from Proposition 2.1. This is the invariant measure of the squared L2 -norm of
the Eulerian velocity process uσt . We emphasize that this invariant measure
is independent of the interpolation parameter σ ∈ (0, ∞). We record part of
these facts in the following statement.
Corollary 4.5. Fix σ ∈ (0, ∞). The L2 -norm of the velocity field uσ of kinetic
Brownian motion is an ergodic process taking values in the interval (0, λ−s
0 ),
with invariant probability measure the image of a constant multiple of the
measure with density 1/kuk with respect to the Gaussian measure in H with
covariance ι0 ι∗0 , by the map

u ∈ H 7→ Q0 u/kuk .
It is desirable to study the homogenization problem for other intrinsically randomly perturbated partial differential equations of geometric nature,
such as the KdV, (modified) Camassa-Holm equations, or equations with nonlocal inertia operator, such as the modified Constantin-Lax-Majda equation
[Kol17]. The core technical problem, from the geometric/analytic point of
view, is the definition of Cartan development map as the solution map of an
ordinary differential equation driven by sufficiently regular vector fields on
the configuration space. We took advantage, in the present L2 setting, of the
‘pointwise’ character of the associated geometric objects to recast things in
terms of the F bundles of Section 3.1. One may have to proceed differently

Kinetic Brownian motion in configuration space

for other weak metrics. We expect the homogenization results proved in Theorem 4.3 and Theorem 4.4 to have analogues in the setting of the strong,
complete, Riemannian metrics of [BV20]. Global in time existence results for
kinetic Brownian motion and its limit Brownian motion are expected. We
leave these questions for a forthcoming work.
We worked here in the Sobolev setting to make things easier and concentrate on the probabilistic problems, and the implementation of the rough
path approach in this infinite dimensional setting. It is a natural question
to ask whether one can run the analysis in the Fréchet setting of smooth
diffeomorphisms of M , asking for preservation of the regularity of the initial condition and velocity, as in Ebin-Marsden seminal work – Section 12 in
[EM69], under proper assumptions on the noise.

Appendix A. Cartan development in M0
We prove in this Appendix that Cartan’s development system
 (19) on M0
can be recast as an ordinary differential equation in H s F (e) × L H s (T M ) ,
driven by a smooth vector field. It has, as a consequence, a unique solution,
up to a possibly finite explosion time.
Let P : T M → T M , stand for a smooth vector bundle morphism that
coincides with the Hodge projector P from (15) on T M0 . The existence of
such a map follows from the following elementary partition of unity result.
Proposition A.1. Let (Oi )i∈I be an open cover of M . Then there exists a
smooth partition of unity subordinated to (Oi )i∈I .

is smooth, the problem reduces to the following question. Let a Banach
manifold A and a Hilbert space H, be given together with a smooth map
F : A × H → H, that is linear with respect to its second argument. Denote
by a and b generic elements of A. Prove that the curryfication Cur F : a ∈
A 7→ F (a, ·) ∈ L(H) is well-defined and smooth.
Write d for the differential operator. We show that d(Cur F ) = Cur (∂a F ).
This will be enough, since we can then bootstrap the construction to show
that dn (Cur F ) = Cur (∂an F ), is differentiable for any n. Because the result
is local, we can assume without loss of generality that A an open set of a
Banach space. Fix a ∈ M , and let U × B(0, ε) be a convex neighbourhood of
(a, 0) in A × H, such that k∂a2 F k∞ < 1 + k∂a2 F (a, 0)k. Then for all b ∈ U and
|w| < 1, one has
|b − a|2 2
k∂a F k∞ |w|/.
2
The conclusion follows from the fact that we have in particular the estimate
F (b, w) − F (a, w) − ∂a F (a, w)(b − a) ≤

CurF (b) − CurF (a) − Cur(∂a F )(a; b − a) ≤ c |b − a|2 ,
for a positive constant c independent of b.

(H , H ) is smooth, equation (23) is locally well-posed, possibly up to a finite
explosion time ζ.
Theorem A.3. The path (ϕt ) takes values in M0 , and coincides

ϕt preserves the volume form. It is a non-empty closed subset of [0, ζ). Fix

extension Pb of P , possibly different from P . We choose for Pb any smooth

This differential equation satisfies the classical Picard-Lindelöf assumptions,
so it has a unique solution with given initial condition. Since Z0 = 0 and the
constant zero vector field is a solution to the equation, Zt is identically zero,
and et (Z) is divergence-free.
This holds true for any Z, in a time interval independent of Z. It follows
in particular that ϕ̇t = et ft (Ẋt ) is locally divergence-free, and ϕt preserves
the volume form, in a neighbourhood of the time t0 . The interval I is thus
