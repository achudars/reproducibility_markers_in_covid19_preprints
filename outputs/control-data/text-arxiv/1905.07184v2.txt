ON SOME GENERIC SMALL CANTOR SPACES
EMMA D’ANIELLO AND MARTINA MAIURIELLO
Abstract. Let X = [0, 1]n , n > 1. We show that the typical (in the sense
of Baire category) compact subset of X is not only a zero dimensional Cantor space but it satisfies the property of being strongly microscopic, which is
stronger than dimension zero.

1. Introduction
Microscopic subsets of the real line were introduced in [1]. Since then, they have
been widely studied (see, for instance, [2], [3], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],
[17], [20], [22], [23]). The collection of microscopic subsets of the real line is a σideal and it is a proper subset of the family of the Hausdorff zero dimensional sets
([2], [12]). In [3], the authors consider the family CS of symmetric Cantor subsets
of [0, 1], and among other results, they obtain properties concerning the subfamily
of microscopic sets. In [10], [11] and [14], the authors generalise the notion of a
microscopic set in R.
In [22] and [23] some Fubini type properties involving microscopic fibers are studied. In [13] and in [17], the notion of a microscopic set in the plane is investigated.
The authors use the word “miscroscopic" when the coverings consist of rectangles
and the expression “strong microscopic" when only coverings made of cubes are
considered.
This note is motivated by the above mentioned results. In section 2, we investigate how “frequent" strongly microscopic, and therefore microscopic, compact sets
are. We show that most compact subsets of [0, 1]n , n > 1, are strongly microscopic.
Our approach is the following. We furnish the class of nonempty closed subsets
n
of [0, 1] with the Hausdorff metric. Since it is a complete metric space ([5], [9]
[19]), we can make effective use of the Baire Category Theorem ([5], [21]). We
find information concerning “typical" members of in Theorem 2.11. Indeed, we find
n
that the typical compact subset E of [0, 1] is a strongly microscopic Cantor space,
where we recall the term typical is to indicate that the collection of sets having the
property under consideration has first category complement in the complete metric
space.
Moreover, in section 3, we provide, in any dimension, an example of a non-microscopic,
Hausdorff zero dimensional Cantor space.

2. Microscopic sets are not exceptional in [0, 1]

Definition 2.1. Let n > 1. We call interval any subset I of Rn of type I =
J1 × · · · × Jn , with Ji intervals of the real line, for each 1 6 i 6 n. We call I a cube
if J1 = · · · = Jn .
Clearly, an interval I is open if Ji is an open interval of the real line for every
1 6 i 6 n.
Definition 2.2. A set E ⊆ Rn is microscopic if for each ε > 0 there exists a
sequence of intervals {Ik }k∈N such that
E ⊆ ∪k∈N Ik and λ(Ik ) 6 εk , for k ∈ N,

where λ is the Lebesgue measure on Rn .

Definition 2.3. A set E ⊆ Rn , n > 2, is strongly microscopic if for each ε > 0
there exists a sequence of cubes {Ik }k∈N such that
E ⊆ ∪k∈N Ik and λ(Ik ) 6 εk , for k ∈ N,

where λ is the Lebesgue measure on Rn .

Remark 2.4. Let E ⊆ Rn , n > 2. Then

E strongly microscopic ⇒ E microscopic.

The above implication cannot be reverted [17].

Some simple properties about microscopic and strongly microscopic sets hold,
and they are collected in the following proposition. The proof in [2] for the case
n = 1 works for any n ∈ N, with slight, obvious modifications.
Proposition 2.5. The following hold in Rn :
(1) Every countable set is strongly microscopic.
(2) Every microscopic set is a null set (meaning it has Lebesgue n-dimensional
measure equal to 0).
(3) Every subset of a (strongly, resp.) microscopic set is (strongly, resp.) microscopic.
(4) Every countable union of (strongly, resp.) microscopic sets is (strongly,
resp.) microscopic.
(5) Every strongly microscopic set E has α-dimensional Hausdorff measure
equal to zero for all α > 0, and thus it has Hausdorff dimension zero.
Remark 2.6. Clearly, the notion of a strongly microscopic set differs from the
notion of a microscopic set when n > 2. When n > 2, Property (5) of Proposition
2.5 does not hold if we replace “strongly microscopic" with “microscopic". For
example, as also observed in [17], the set A = [0, 1] × {0} is a microscopic subset of
R2 , but its Hausdorff dimension is one.
Fix any n > 1. By M and by MS we denote the collection of all microscopic
subsets of Rn and the family of all strongly microscopic subsets of Rn , respectively.
In order to show that strongly microscopic sets, and therefore microscopic sets,
n
are not exceptional among the compact subsets of [0, 1] , indeed they are very
frequent, we need to recall some classical definitions and facts, and prove some

preliminary results.
In the sequel, by d(x, y), with x and y points of [0, 1]n , we always mean the
Euclidean distance in Rn .
As usual, we define the diameter of a non-empty set A, and we denote it by
diam(A), as the greatest distance apart of pairs of points in A, that is, diam(A) =
sup{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ A}. Given two sets A and B, we define their Euclidean distance,
and we denote it by dist(A, B) as dist(A, B) = inf {d(x, y) : x ∈ A, y ∈ B}. Hence,
given a point z, the distance between the point z and the set A is dist(z, A) =
dist({z}, A).
Let K be the collection of non-empty, compact subsets of [0, 1]n , n > 1. We
furnish K with the Hausdorff metric given by
H(A, E) = inf{δ > 0 : A ⊂ Bδ (E), E ⊂ Bδ (A)},

where the δ-neighbourhood or δ-parallel body, Bδ (E), of a set E is the set of points
within distance δ of E. The Hausdorff metric space (K, H) is also compact ([5], [9]
[19]), and therefore complete.
Since (K, H) is complete, we can use the Baire category theorem. Recall that a set
is of the first category in the complete space (X, ρ) whenever it can be written as a
countable union of nowhere dense sets; otherwise, the set is of the second category
([5], [21]). A set is residual if it is the complement of a first category set, and an
element of a residual set is called typical (or generic).
In the sequel, by V ([0, 1]n ), we denote the set of all vertices of [0, 1]n , that is
V ([0, 1]n ) = {(x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ [0, 1]n : xj ∈ {0, 1}, ∀j ∈ {1, . . . , n}}.

Given an interval I = J1 × · · · × Jn of Rn , with Ji intervals of the real line, for
each 1 6 i 6 n, we let
lI = min{λ(Ji ) : 1 6 i 6 n}
where λ(Ji ) is the 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the real interval Ji , that is
its length.
Definition 2.7. Let I1 , ..., It be open intervals (relative to [0, 1]n ). Let B(I1 , ..., It )
be the collection of all K ∈ K such that:
(1) K ⊆ ∪ti=1 Ii ;
(2) K ∩ Ii 6= ∅ for each i ∈ {1, ..., t}.
Next we generalise Lemma 2.5 of [4] to any finite dimension.

Lemma 2.8. Let I1 , ..., It be open intervals (relative to [0, 1]n ). Then B(I1 , ..., It )
is open in (K, H).
Proof. Let K ∈ B(I1 , ..., It ). We need to find ε > 0 such that Bε (K) ⊆ B(I1 , ..., It )
(we recall that Bε (K) = {T ∈ K : H(T, K) < ε}). For each i ∈ {1, ..., t}, we choose
xi ∈ K ∩ Ii and we define:

dist (xi , [0, 1]n \ Ii ) if xi ∈
/ V ([0, 1]n ) ,
εi =

Let ε := min{εi , 0 6 i 6 t}. We now show that Bε (K) ⊆ B(I1 , ..., It ). To this aim,
let us consider T ∈ Bε (K). We first show that T ∩ Ii 6= ∅ for each i ∈ {1, ..., t}.
Let i ∈ {1, ..., t}. As H(K, T ) < ε 6 εi , it follows that T ∩ Ii 6= ∅. In fact:

/ V ([0, 1]n ). Then, εi = dist (xi , [0, 1]n \ Ii ). If by contradiction T ∩Ii =
Case 1: xi ∈
/ Bεi (T ). This
∅, then T ⊆ ([0, 1]n \ Ii ) so that dist(xi , T ) > εi and then xi ∈
is in contrast with the fact that xi ∈ K ⊆ Bεi (T ).
Case 2: xi ∈ V ([0, 1]n ). Then, εi = lIi . As xi ∈ K ⊆ Bεi (T ), it follows that there
exists z ∈ T such that d(xi , z) < εi = lIi and hence z ∈ T ∩ Ii .
Now, we prove that if H(K, T ) < ε0 then T ⊆ ∪ti=1 Ii . In fact:

Case i: ε0 = 1. Then, clearly T ⊆ ∪ti=1 Ii since ∪ti=1 Ii = [0, 1]n .
Case ii: ε0 = dist (K, [0, 1]n \ ∪ti=1 Ii ), with ∪ti=1 Ii 6= [0, 1]n . If, by contradiction,
T * ∪ti=1 Ii , then by the definition of ε0 it cannot be T ⊆ Bε0 (K). This is
in contrast with the fact that H(K, T ) < ε0 .
Hence, the proof is complete.

Proposition 2.9. The typical compact subset of [0, 1]n is a strongly microscopic
set.
Proof. Let
MSK = {E ⊂ [0, 1]n : E is non-empty, compact and strongly microscopic}
that is MSK = K ∩ MS .
Let us start by showing that MSK is dense in K. Let F = {E ∈ K : E is finite}. It
is clear that F is dense in K and each element of F is strongly microscopic. Thus
MSK is dense in K.
Now we prove that MSK is a Gδ subset of K. For each s ∈ N let
K[s] =

Fix s ∈ N. Let E ∈ K[s] , and let {Ij }j∈N be a covering of E, where each Ij is an
j
open cube with λ(Ij ) 6 ( 1s ) . Then, as E is compact, there exist Ij1 , ..., Ijm finitely

Thus, if F ∈ B(Ij1 , ..., Ijm ) it is F ⊆ ∪m

We recall that a topological space is a Cantor space if it is non-empty, perfect,
compact, totally disconnected, and metrisable.
Hence, a topological space is a Cantor space if it is homeomorphic to the Cantor
ternary set. As in [7], let Q denote the rational numbers and
IR = {(a1 , ..., an ) ∈ [0, 1]n : aj ∈ [0, 1] \ Q, for all 1 6 j 6 n} ,

ON SOME GENERIC SMALL CANTOR SPACES

that is, IR denotes the collection of all points in [0, 1]n with all the coordinates
irrational.
Let, as in [7],
K1 = {F ∈ K : F is a Cantor space and F ⊆ IR} .

We recall from [7] the following proposition:

Proposition 2.10. The collection K1 is a dense set of type Gδ in K.
From this result and from Proposition 2.9 we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 2.11. The typical compact subset K of [0, 1]n is a strongly microscopic
Cantor space.
Proof. By Proposition 2.9, the collection of the non-empty, compact and strongly
microscopic subsets of [0, 1]n , that is MSK , is a dense set of type Gδ . By Proposition
2.10, the collection K1 also is a dense Gδ set. Since the intersection of two dense
Gδ sets is still a dense Gδ set, the thesis follows.

3. Examples
n

Cantor spaces in [0, 1] can be of various type, for instance very irregular, symmetric, etc. The Cantor ternary set is symmetric but it is not microscopic. On the
other hand, on the real line, there exist symmetric Cantor spaces that are microscopic. More is true: in [3], it is shown that in [0, 1] microscopic symmetric Cantor
spaces form a residual family.
n
In [0, 1] , we find Cantor spaces of any positive dimension, self-similar and non,
([19], [5], [6], [3]) and therefore non-strongly microscopic. In [2], it was shown that,
in [0, 1], Hausdorff dimension zero is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition
in order for a set, and in particular for a Cantor space, to be microscopic. In the
n
next example, for any n > 1, we construct a Cantor space in [0, 1] having Hausdorff dimension zero but not being microscopic.
Definition 3.1. In the following, for a general n > 1, by a cube we mean a nondegenerated closed cube, that is any interval I = J1 × · · · × Jn of Rn such that there
exists a non-degenerate closed interval of the real line, [a, b], with Ji = [a, b] for each
1 6 i 6 n. Clearly, when n = 1 it is more natural to talk about closed intervals,
when n = 2 about closed squares, and when n = 3 about closed cubes.
Example 3.2 Fix n > 1. In the sequel, by λ we denote the Lebesgue nn
dimensional measure. The Cantor space we construct from the unit cube [0, 1] is a
“Cantor dust" ([8], [19]) . At each stage of the construction we select smaller cubes
in the way described below.

Fix a constant c > 2n + 1, let V0 = 1, and Vk = k2 for k ∈ N.

At the first step we select 2n disjoint cubes in [0, 1]n of measure V1 = , and having
c
one vertex in V ([0, 1]n ). We list these cubes as Qi1 , with i1 ∈ {1, ..., 2n }.
At the second step, in each of the previous cubes Qi1 , we select 2n disjoint cubes

of measure V2 = 4 , having one vertex in common with Qi1 , and we list them as
c
Qi1 ,i2 , with (i1 , i2 ) ∈ {1, ..., 2n }2 .

Notice that δk is the measure of what is left, at the k-th step, in Qi1 ,...,ik−1 when
we remove from it 2n disjoint cubes each of measure Vk . This works by the choice
of c > 2n + 1, from which it follows that δk > 0 for each k ∈ N.
Therefore, for each k ∈ N, at the k-th step we have constructed a collection of cubes
Qk = {Qi1 ,...,ik , with (i1 , ..., ik ) ∈ {1, ..., 2n }k }

such that:
(1) each cube Qi1 contains a vertex of V ([0, 1]n ) and, for k > 1, each cube
Qi1 ,...,ik has only one vertex in common with Qi1 ,...,ik−1 ;

Clearly, by construction, C is a Cantor space.
Let α > 0. We now prove that Hα (C) = 0.

Therefore, (•) holds for every k > 1.
The inequality (•), in particular, means that there are cubes at the k − th step

For each fixed k, let Fk be the union of these cubes. By construction, Fk is a
decreasing sequence of nonempty compact sets. Consequently, the intersection F =
F1 ∩F2 ∩F3 ... is a nonempty compact subset of C and, also by construction, none of
the rectangles Ih intersects F . In particular, the union of the rectangles Ih cannot
cover F, and then cannot cover C either. Hence C is not microscopic.
