Abstract
We explore the canonical Grothendieck topology in some specific circumstances. First we use a description of the canonical topology to get a
variant of Giraud’s Theorem. Then we explore the canonical Grothendieck
topology on the categories of sets and topological spaces; here we get a
nice basis for the topology. Lastly, we look at the canonical Grothendieck
topology on the category of R-modules.

Introduction

In SGA 4.2.2 Verdier defined the canonical Grothendieck topology as the largest
Grothendieck topology where all representable presheaves are sheaves. This paper grew out of an attempt to obtain a precise description of the covers in this
Grothendieck topology in the cases of some familiar categories; we investigate
the question for sets, abelian groups, R-modules, topological spaces and compactly generated Hausdorff spaces. The category of sets is simple enough that
we can give a complete answer, and in the two categories of topological spaces
1

we give a fairly precise description. The question for abelain groups and Rmodules seems to be very subtle, though, and we have only been able to obtain
partial results. Along the way we prove that the canonical topology has a natural appearance in Giraud’s Theorem, which is the source for some of our interest
in it.
Sieves will be of particular importance in this paper and so we start with a
reminder of its definition; we follow the notation and terminology used by Mac
Lane and Moerdijk in [3]. For any object X of a category C, we call S a sieve on
X if S is a collection of morphisms, all of whose codomains are X, that is closed
under precomposition, i.e. if f ∈ S and f ◦ g makes sense, then f ◦ g ∈ S. In
particular, we can view a sieve S on X as a full subcategory of the overcategory
(C ↓ X).
By work from [2], the canonical Grothendieck topology can be characterized
in terms of colimits. Specifically, the canonical Grothendieck topology can be
described as the collection of all universal colim sieves where:
Definition 1.1. For a category C, an object X of C and sieve S on X, we
call S a colim sieve if colimS U exists and the canonical map colimS U → X is
−−−→
−−−→
an isomorphism. (Alternatively, S is a colim sieve if X is the universal cocone
under the diagram U : S → C.) Moreover, we call S a universal colim sieve if
for all arrows α : Y → X in C, α∗ S is a colim sieve on Y .
One use of this presentation is the following variant of Giraud’s Theorem:
Proposition 3.14. If E is a ‘nice’ category, then E is equivalent to the category
of sheaves on E under the canonical topology.
The universal-colim-sieve presentation also affords us an explicit description
of the canonical Grothendieck topology’s covers on the category of topological
spaces:
Proposition 4.6. In the category of all topological spaces, {A
` α → X}α∈A
is part of a basis for the canonical topology if and only if α : α∈A Aα → X
is a universal quotient map (i.e. α and every pullback of α is a quotient map).
Additionally, a sieve S on X is a (universal) colim
`sieve if and only if there exists
some collection {Aα → X}α∈A ⊂ S such that α∈A Aα → X is a (universal)
quotient map. In particular, T = h{f : Y → X}i is a (universal) colim sieve if
and only if f is a (universal) quotient map.
Proposition 4.7. In the category of compactly generated weakly Hausdorff
spaces,
{Aα → X}α∈A is part of the basis for the canonical topology if and only
`
a sieve S = h{Aα → X}α∈A i
if α∈A Aα → X is a quotient map. In particular,`
on X is in the canonical topology if and only if α∈A Aα → X is a quotient
map. Moreover, every colim sieve is universal.
Furthermore, this presentation allows us to more easily compute examples and
non-examples in the category of topological spaces; for instance,
2

Example 4.14/Example 4.15. Take Rn → Rn+1 be the closed inclusion map
(x1 , . . . , xn ) 7→ (x1 , . . . , xn , 0) and use R∞ to denote the direct limit colimn∈N Rn
−−−→
with maps ιn : Rn → R∞ . Then the cover generated by {ιn }n∈N is not in
the canonical topology for the category of all topological spaces but is in the
canonical topology for the category of compactly generated weakly Hausdorff
spaces.
Additionally, we can use the universal-colim-sieve presentation to get a better
idea of the canonical Grothendieck topology’s covers on the category of Rmodules. For example,
Proposition 5.6. Let S be the cover generated by {f1 : M1 → R, f2 : M2 → R}
such that im(fi ) = ai R for i = 1, 2. Then S is in the canonical topology on
R-Mod if and only if (a1 , a2 ) = R.
Proposition 5.8. Let R be an infinite principal ideal domain. Let S be the
mi
cover generated by {gi : Rn ֒→ Rn }M
֒→ Rn | mi < n}N
i=1 ∪ {fi : R
i=1 . If S a
cover in the canonical topology on R-Mod, then g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gM : RnM → Rn is
a surjection.

Proposition 5.24. Let S be the cover generated by {Z −−→
i=1 . Then S is
in the canonical topology on Z-Mod if and only if gcd(a1 , . . . , aN ) = 1.

Zn }N
Proposition 5.25. Let S be the cover generated by {Zn −→
i=1 where Ai
is a diagonal matrix with det(Ai ) 6= 0. Then there exists a map β : Z → Zn such
that β ∗ S is not a colim sieve in Z-Mod if and only if gcd(det(A1 ), . . . , det(AN ))
does not equal 1.

Organization.
To start this paper we recall some results from [2] in Section 2. Then in
Section 3 we review Giraud’s theorem and prove our Corollary to Giraud’s Theorem, i.e. we prove that that every category C, which satisfies some hypotheses,
is equivalent to the category of sheaves on C with the canonical topology. In
Section 4 we briefly discuss the canonical topology on the category of sets before
exploring the canonical topology on the category of topological spaces. Specifically, we look at the category of all topological spaces and the category of
compactly generated weakly Hausdorff spaces. We are able to refine our description and obtain a basis for the canonical topology; this result reduces the
question “Is this in the canonical topology?” to the question “Is a specific map
a universal quotient map?” Since universal quotient maps have been studied
in-depth (for example by Day and Kelly in [1]), this reduction becomes our most
computationally agreeable description of the canonical topology and hence we
use it to find some specific examples and non-examples. Lastly, in Section 5
we investigate the canonical topology on the category of R-modules and the
category of abelian groups, where we work towards refining our description by
making some reductions and obtaining some exclusionary results. While these

3

reductions and results lead us to some specific examples and non-examples, a
basis for the canonical topology remains elusive.
General Notation.
Notation 1.2. For any subcategory S of (C ↓ X), we will use U to represent
the forgetful functor S → C. For example, for a sieve S on X, U (f ) = domain f .
Notation 1.3. We say that a sieve S on X is generated by the morphisms
{fα : Aα → X}α∈A and write S = h{fα : Aα → X}α∈A i if each f ∈ S factors
through one of the fα , i.e. if f ∈ S then there exists an α ∈ A and morphism
g such that f = fα ◦ g.

Background

This section contains a review of the results from [2] that will be used in this
paper.

where the left and right vertical maps are induced from the projection morphisms π1 : Ai ×X Aj → Ai and π2 : Ai ×X Aj → Aj .

Lemma 2.3. Let C be a category. Then S is a colim sieve on X if and only if
f ∗ S is a colim sieve for any isomorphism f : Y → X.
Recall that a morphism f : Y → X is called an effective epimorphism provided Y ×X Y exists, f is an epimorphism and c : Coeq (Y ×X Y −→
−→ Y ) → X
is an isomorphism. Note that this third condition actually implies the second

because f = c ◦ g where g : Y → Coeq (Y ×X Y −
−→ Y ) is the canonical map.
Indeed, g is an epimorphism by an easy exercise and c is an epimorphism since
it is an isomorphism.
Additionally, f : Y → X is called a universal effective epimorphism if f is
an effective epimorphism with the additional property that for every pullback
diagram

πg is also an effective epimorphism.
Corollary 2.4. Let C be a cocomplete category with pullbacks. If
S = h{f : Y → X}i
is a sieve on X, then S is a colim sieve if and only if f is an effective epimorphism.
Moreover, S is a universal colim sieve if and only if f is a universal effective
epimorphism.
Theorem 2.5. Let C be any category. The collection of all universal colim
sieves on C forms a Grothendieck topology.
Theorem 2.6. For any (locally small) category C, the collection of all universal
colim sieves on C is the canonical topology.
Proposition 2.7. Let C be a cocomplete category with pullbacks. Futher
assume that coproducts and pullbacks commute in C. Then a sieve of the form
S = h{f
`α : Aα`→ X}α∈A i is a (universal) colim sieve if and only if the sieve
T = h{ fα : α∈A Aα → X}i is a (universal) colim sieve.

Theorem 2.8. Let C be a cocomplete category with pullbacks whose coproducts
and pullbacks commute. A sieve S on X is a (universal)
a colim sieve of C if and
only if there exists some {Aα → X}α∈A ⊂ S where
Aα → X is a (universal)
α∈A

effective epimorphism.

Theorem 2.9. Let C be a cocomplete category with stable and disjoint coproducts and all pullbacks. For each X in C, define K(X) by
a
{Aα → X}α∈A ∈ K(X) ⇐⇒
Aα → X is a universal effective epimorphism.
α∈A

Then K is a Grothendieck basis and generates the canonical topology on C.

Giraud’s Theorem and the Canonical Topology

Giraud’s Theorem shows that categories with certain nice properties can be
written as sheaves on a Grothendieck site. We show that in fact, modulo universe considerations, one may take this site to be the original category with the
canonical topology.
We will specifically use the version of Giraud’s Theorem stated in [3]. In
fact, the appendix of [3] has a thorough discussion of Giraud’s theorem and all
of the terminology used in it; we will include the basics of this discussion for
completeness. We will begin by recalling the definitions used in Mac Lane and
Moerdijk’s version of Giraud’s Theorem.
Throughout this section, let E be a category with small hom-sets and all
finite limits.
Disjoint and Stable Coproducts
Let Eα be a family of objects in E and E = ∐α Eα .
Definition 3.1. The coproduct E is called disjoint if every coproduct inclusion
iα : Eα → E is a monomorphism and, whenever α 6= β, Eα ×E Eβ is the initial
object in E.
Definition 3.2. The coproduct E is called stable (under pullback) if for every
f : D → E in E, the morphisms jα obtained from the pullback diagrams
D ×E Eα

Eα

jα

iα

induce an isomorphism

`

Remark 3.3. If every coproduct in E is stable,
then the pullback
operation
`
`
− ×E D “commutes” with coproducts, i.e. ( α Bα ) ×E D ∼
= α (Bα ×E D).
Coequalizer Morphisms and Kernel Pairs
Definition 3.4. We call a morphism f : Y → Z in E a coequalizer if there exists
some object X and morphisms ∂0 , ∂1 : X → Y such that
∂0

f

→
X−
−→ Y −→ Z
∂1

is a coequalizer diagram.
We remark that every coequalizing morphism is an epimorphism but the
converse of this statement is not guaranteed.

Definition 3.5. The pair of morphisms ∂0 , ∂1 : X → Y are called a kernel pair
for f : Y → Z if the following is a pullback diagram

Equivalence Relations and Quotients
Definition 3.6. An equivalence relation on the object E of E is a subobject R
of E × E, represented by the monomorphism (∂0 , ∂1 ) : R → E × E, satisfying
the following axioms
1. (reflexive) the diagonal ∆ : E → E × E factors through (∂0 , ∂1 ),
2. (symmetric) the map (∂1 , ∂0 ) : R → E × E factors through (∂0 , ∂1 ),
3. (transitivity) if R ×E R is the pullback
π1

R ×E R
π0

R
∂0

R

E

then (∂1 π1 , ∂0 π0 ) : R ×E R → E × E factors through R.
Definition 3.7. If E is an object of E with equivalence relation R, then the
quotient is denoted E/R and is defined to be

 ∂
0
−→
Coeq R −→ E
∂1

provided that this coequalizer exists.
Stably Exact Forks
A diagram is called a fork if it is of the form

(1)

∂1

Definition 3.8. The fork (1) is called exact if ∂0 and ∂1 are the kernel pair for
q, and q is the coequalizer of ∂0 and ∂1 .
Definition 3.9. The fork (1) is called stably exact if the pullback of (1) along
any morphism in E yields an exact fork, i.e. if for any Z ′ → Z in E,
q×1

X ×Z Z ′ −→

is an exact fork.

sense that for any
identity uw = vw,

A set of objects {Ai | i ∈ I} of E is said to generate E if for
E, W = {Ai → E | i ∈ I} is an epimorphic family (in the
two parallel arrows u, v : E → E ′ , if every w ∈ W yields the
then u = v).

Giraud’s Theorem
Theorem 3.11 (Giraud, [3]). A category E with small hom-sets and all finite
limits is a Grothendieck topos if and only if it has the following properties (which
we will refer to as Giraud’s axioms):
(i) E has small coproducts which are disjoint and stable under pullback,
(ii) every epimorphism in E is a coequalizer,
(iii) every equivalence relation R
(iv) every exact fork R

→
→

→
→

E in E is a kernel pair and has a quotient,

E → Q is stably exact,

(v) there is a small set of objects of E which generate E.
Discussion 3.12. Taken together, Giraud’s axioms (ii) and (iv) imply that for
f

each epimorphism B −
→ A, the fork B ×A B →
→ B → A is stably exact. The
exactness implies f is an effective epimorphism and the stability implies f is a
universal effective epimorphism.
Notation 3.13. We use Sh(E, J) to represent the category of sheaves on the
category E under the topology J.
Suppose the category E has small hom-sets and all finite limits, satisfies
Giraud’s axioms, and whose small set of generators (axiom v) is C. In [3] Mac
Lane and Moerdijk specifically prove E ∼
= Sh(C, J) where J is the Grothendieck
topology on C defined by:
a
D → X is an epimorphism in E.
S ∈ J(X) if and only if
(g : D→X)∈S

(In particular, Mac Lane and Moerdijk prove that J is a Grothendieck topology.)
Proposition 3.14. Suppose the category E has small hom-sets and all finite
limits, satisfies Giraud’s axioms, and whose small set of generators (axiom v) is
C. Then E is equivalent to Sh(C, C) where C is the canonical topology on C.
Proof. Let J be the topology defined above. Additionally, the above discussion
implies that it suffices to show that J is the canonical topology. By Theorem
2.6, we will instead show that every universal colim sieve is in J and that every
sieve in J is a universal colim sieve.
By Remark 3.3, coproducts and pullbacks commute and hence for any collection of morphisms {Ai → X}i∈I in E, the diagrams

Similar to the last paragraph, we can use (2) to show that f ∗ S is a colim sieve

proof we will use the fact that TS is a universal colim sieve to show that Tf ∗ S is a
colim sieve. Let f : Y → X be any morphism in E. Then by using S as a generating collection for itself and Lemma 2.1,Dn

Universal Colim Sieves in the Categories of
Sets and Topological Spaces

In this section we examine the canonical topology on the categories of sets, all
topological spaces and compactly generated weakly Haudsdorff spaces.
Notation 4.1. We will use Sets to denote the category of sets. We will use Top
to denote the category of all topological spaces, CG to denote the category of
compactly generated spaces, and CGWH to denote the category of compactly
generated weakly Hausdorff spaces. When we want to talk about the category of
topological spaces without differentiating between Top and CGWH, then we
will use Spaces; all results about Spaces will hold for both Top and CGWH.
We will begin with a few reminders about the category of compactly generated weakly Hausdorff spaces based on the references [6] and [4]. Specifically,
there are functors k : Top → CG and h : CG → CGWH such that
• For a topological space X with topology τ , a subset Y of X is called
k-closed if u−1 (Y ) is closed in K for every continuous map u : K → X
and compact Hausdorff space K. The collection of all k-closed subsets,
called k(τ ), is a topology.
10

• The functor k takes X with topology τ to the set X with topology k(τ ).
• k is right adjoint to the inclusion functor ι : CG → Top.
• h(X) is X/E where E is the smallest equivalence relation on X closed in
X × X.
• h is left adjoint to the inclusion functor ι′ : CGWH → CG.
• A limit in CGWH is k applied to the limit taken in Top, i.e. for a
diagram F : I → CGWH, the limit of F is k(limI ιι′ F ).
• A colimit in CGWH is h applied to the colimit taken in Top, i.e. for a
diagram F : I → CGWH, the colimit of F is h(colimI ιι′ F ).
−−−→
Proposition 4.2. Let S be a sieve on X in either Sets or Top. Let C be
colim U . Then the natural map ϕ : C → X is an injection.
−−−→
S

Proof. Suppose ỹ, z̃ ∈ C and ϕ(ỹ) = x = ϕ(z̃). We can pick a (Y → X) ∈ S
and a y ∈ Y that represents ỹ, i.e. where y 7→ ỹ under the natural map Y → C;
similarly, we can pick a (Z → X) ∈ S and a z ∈ Z representing z̃. Then the
inclusion i : {x} ֒→ X factors through both Y and Z by x 7→ y and x 7→ z
respectively. Thus i ∈ S. Hence ỹ = z̃ in C.
Corollary 4.3. Let S be a sieve on X in CGWH. Then the colimit over S
taken in Top is in CGWH, i.e. h(colimI ιι′ U ) = colimI ιι′ U . Moreover, the
−−−→
−−−→
natural map ϕ : colimS U → X is an injection.
−−−→
Proof. We will make use of the following Proposition from [6]: if Z is in CG,
then Z is weakly Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal subspace ∆Z is closed
in Z × Z. Additionally, we remark that colimits of compactly generated spaces
computed in Top are automatically compactly generated.
Let C = colimS ιι′ U , i.e. C is the colimit over S taken in Top. By Proposi−−−→
tion 4.2, the natural map ϕ : C → X is an injection; we remark that it is not the
statement of Proposition 4.2 that gives this observation since S is not a sieve
in Top, instead the proof of Proposition 4.2 holds in this situation since {x} is
in CGWH. Since X is CGWH, then ∆X is closed in X × X. Since ϕ is a
continuous injection, then (ϕ × ϕ)−1 (∆X ) = ∆C is closed in C × C.

4.1

Basis and Presentation

The categories Sets, Top and CGWH all satisfy the hypotheses of Theorems
2.9 and 2.8. Thus we have the following corollaries of Theorems 2.9 and 2.8
based on what the universal effective epimorphisms are in each category.
Proposition 4.4. In Sets,
` {Aα → X}α∈A is part of a basis for the canonical
topology if and only if α∈A Aα → X is a surjection. In particular, a sieve of
the
a form S = h{Aα → X}α∈A i on X is in the canonical topology if and only if
Aα → X is a surjection. Moreover, every colim sieve is universal.
α∈A

11

Proof. It is easy to see in Sets that the effective epimorphisms are precisely
the surjections. Since pulling back a surjection yields a surjection, then the
universal effective epimorphisms in the category of sets are also the surjections.
Lastly, this implies, by Theorem 2.8, that every colim sieve is universal.
Remark 4.5. Since Sets is a Grothendieck topos, we can compare Proposition
4.4 to the proof of Proposition 3.14. Specifically, Proposition 4.4 allows us to
determine if a sieve is in the canonical topology by looking only at the sieve’s
generating set whereas the proof of Proposition 3.14 along with the Grothendieck
topology J require us to look at the entire sieve.
Recall that a quotient map f is called universal if every pullback of f along
a map yields a quotient map.
Proposition 4.6. In `
Top, {Aα → X}α∈A is part of a basis for the canonical
topology if and only if α∈A Aα → X is a universal quotient map. Additionally,
a sieve S on X is a (universal) colim sieve
a if and only if there exists some
collection {Aα → X}α∈A ⊂ S such that
Aα → X is a (universal) quotient
α∈A

map. In particular, T = h{f : Y → X}i is a (universal) colim sieve if and only
if f is a (universal) quotient map.

Proof. It is a well-known fact that in Top the effective epimorphisms are precisely the quotient maps.
Proposition 4.7. In CGWH,`{Aα → X}α∈A is part of the basis for the
canonical topology if and only if α∈A Aα → X is a quotient map. In particular,
aa
sieve S = h{Aα → X}α∈A i on X is in the canonical topology if and only if
Aα → X is a quotient map. Moreover, every colim sieve is universal.

Proof. This is a consequence of Corollary 2.4, Corollary 4.3, the fact that
the universal effective epimorphisms in Top are precisely the universal quotient maps, and [6, Proposition 2.36], which states that every quotient map in
CGWH is universal.

4.2

Examples in the category of Spaces

In this section we will use our basis to talk about some specific examples; including a special circumstance (when a sieve is generated by one function) and
how the canonical topology on the categories CGWH and Top can differ in
this situation.
Definition 4.8. For a category D, we call A ⊂ ob(D) a weakly terminal set of
D if for every object X in D, there exists some A ∈ A and morphism X → A
in D.
Additionally, if F : D → C is a functor and D has a weakly terminal set A,
then we call {F (A)}A∈A a weakly terminal set of F .

12

For example, if S = h{Aα → X}α∈Ai is a sieve on X then {Aα }α∈A is the
weakly terminal set of U . Or as another example, {Y } is the weakly terminal
→
set of the diagram Y ×X Y −
−→ Y . One easy consequence of this in Top is a
reduction of the colimit topology: V is open in the colimit if and only if the
preimage of V is open in each member of the weakly terminal set.
Proposition 4.9. Let F : D → Spaces be a functor where D has a weakly
terminal set A. Suppose fA : F (A) → X is an open map for all A ∈ A, then
the induced map ϕ : colimD F → X is an open map. Similarly, if the fA are all
−−−→
closed and A is a finite set, then ϕ is a closed map.
Proof. Let C = colim F and iA : F (A) → C be the natural maps. Both results
−−−→
follow from the easy set equality below for B ⊂ C
[
−1
ϕ(B) =
(B))
fA (iA
A∈A

since

i−1
A ,

fA and unions respect open/closed sets in their respective scenarios.

Corollary 4.10. Let S =a
h{fα : Aα → X}α∈A i be a sieve on X in Spaces
with the induced map η :
Aα → X a surjection. If all of the fα are open
α∈A

maps or if A is a finite collection and all of the fα are closed maps, then S is a
colim sieve.

Proof. Let ϕ : colim U → X be the natural map. By Proposition 4.2, Corollary
−−−→
S
4.3, and the surjectivity of η, ϕ is a continuous bijection. Then Proposition
4.9 implies that ϕ is open or closed, depending on the case, and hence an
isomorphism.
This corollary leads us to some nice examples of sieves we would hope are
in the canonical topology and actually are!
Example 4.11. Let X be any space and let {Ui }i∈I be an open cover of X.
Then the inclusion maps Ui ֒→ X generate a universal colim sieve, call it S.
Indeed, by Corollary 4.10, S is a colim sieve. Universality is obvious, as the
preimage of an open cover is an open cover.
Example 4.12. Let X be any space and let K1 , . . . , Kn be a closed cover of
X. For the exact same reasons as the previous example, the inclusions Ki ֒→ X
generate a sieve in the canonical topology.
Before we give our next example, we rephrase [1, Theorem 1], which completely characterizes universal quotient maps in Top:
Theorem 4.13 (Day and Kelly, 1970). Let f : Y → X be a quotient map.
Then f is a universal quotient map if and only if for every x ∈ X and cover
{Gα }α∈Λ of f −1 (x) by opens in Y , there is a finite set {α1 , . . . , αn } ⊂ Λ such
that f Gα1 ∪ · · · ∪ f Gαn is a neighborhood of x.
13

Example 4.14. Consider the diagram B1 → B2 → B3 → . . . and the direct
limit B = colim Bn in Top. Let S = h{ιn : Bn → B | n ∈ N}i where ιn are the
−−−→
natural maps into the colimit. By Proposition 4.6, S is a colim sieve because
`
n∈N Bn → B is obviously a quotient map. However, S is not necessarily in
the canonical topology – we can use Proposition 4.6 on specific examples to see
when S is and is not in the canonical topology.
For example, suppose there exists an N such that Bm = BN whenever
m > N . Then`B = BN . Hence it is easy to see by Day and Kelly’s condition
that the map n∈N Bn → B is a universal quotient map. Therefore, the S from
this example is in the canonical topology.
As another example, take Bn = Rn and let Bn → Bn+1 be the closed
inclusion map (x1 , . . `
. , xn ) 7→ (x1 , . . . , xn , 0). Use R∞ to denote the direct
limit. We claim that n∈N Rn → R∞ is not a universal quotient map. Indeed,
consider
Day and Kelly’s condition; take x = 0 ∈ R∞ and the open cover in
`
n
n
n
n∈N R consisting of open disks D ⊂ R centered at the origin with fixed
n1
radius ǫ > 0. Pick any finite collection D , . . . , Dnk with n1 < · · · < nk . Then
for i = 1, . . . , k we can view Dni as a subset of Rnk . Hence ∪ki=1 ιni (Dni ) is
∪ki=1 ιnk (Dni ) ⊂ ιnk (Rnk ). However, by dimensional considerations, we can see
that for all b ∈ N, ιb (Rb ) contains no open sets of R∞ and hence ∪ki=1 ιni (Dni )
cannot be a neighborhood of x in R∞ . Remark: To see that ιb (Rb ) contains no
open sets, suppose to the contrary and call the open set V . Then ι−1
b+1 (V ) is
open in Rb+1 and in particular, contains an open ball of dimension b + 1. Thus
dimensional considerations imply that ι−1
b+1 (V ) is not contained in the image of
b
b+1
b
R in R . Since each ιn is an inclusion map, then ιb+1 ι−1
b+1 (V ) 6⊂ ιb+1 (R ) and
b
so V is not contained in ιb (R ), which is our contradiction. Therefore, the S
from this example is not in the canonical topology.
Example 4.15. Consider the diagram B1 → B2 → B3 → . . . and the direct
limit B = colim Bn in CGWH. Let S = h{ιn : Bn → B | n ∈ N}i where ιn are
−−−→
the natural maps into
` the colimit. Then by Proposition 4.7, S is a universal
colim sieve because n∈N Bn → B is a quotient map.

Now we shift our focus to sieves that can be generated by one map, called
monogenic sieves. There are many reasons one could focus on these kinds of
sieves, however by Proposition 2.7, if we fully comprehend when monogenic
sieves are in the canonical topology, then we can (in some sense) completely
understand the canonical topology. From this point onward, this section will
be about monogenic sieves; in other words, by Proposition 4.6 and Proposition
4.7, we will be focusing on (universal) quotient maps.
Remark 4.16. Some examples will talk about the space R/Z. In this section,
this space is not a group quotient but instead is the squashing of the subspace
Z to a point.

Example 4.17. Consider the quotient maps f : S n → RP n and g : R → R/Z.
There is some subtly, which will depend on the category we are in, in determining
if f or g generate universal colim sieves. Throughout the rest of this section we
will continue to explore this particular example.
14

Monogenic Sieves in CGWH
By Proposition 4.7, if X and Y are in CGWH and h : Y → X, then h{h}i
is in the canonical topology if and only if h is a quotient map. Therefore, we
immediately get the following examples:
Example 4.18. Topological manifolds are in CGWH. Thus S n and RP n are
in CGWH. Hence h{f : S n → RP n }i is in the canonical topology.
Example 4.19. Every CW-complex is in CGWH. Thus R and R/Z are in
CGWH. Hence h{g : R → R/Z}i is in the canonical topology.
Monogenic Sieves in Top
This section will heavily rely on Theorem 4.13 (the Theorem by Day and
Kelly characterizing universal quotient maps in Top) because a monogenic sieve
generated by f is in the canonical topology if and only if f is a universal quotient
map.
Example 4.20. Day and Kelly’s theorem implies that every open quotient map
is a universal quotient map. Therefore, the quotient map f : S n → RP n is a
universal quotient map and h{f : S n → RP n }i is in the canonical topology.
Example 4.21. The quotient map g : R → R/Z is not universal. We will
demontrate this in two ways, first by using Day and Kelly’s theorem and second
by directly showing g is not universal. Note: many sets of R/Z will be written
as if they are in R for ease of presentation.
(i) We will look at Day and Kelly’s condition for Z ∈ R/Z with the open cover
(in R) {Gi := (i−m, i+m)}i∈Z for a fixed m ∈ 0, 21 . For any open set U of R/Z
−1
containing Z, the quotient topology
) is an open neighborhood
Sn tells us that g S(U
−1
of Z ⊂ R. But for any n, g ( k=1 gGik ) = Z ∪ ( nk=1 (ik − m, ik + m)) is not
a neighborhood of Z ⊂SR. So there cannot be any open set of R/Z containing
n
Z that is contained in k=1 gGik for any finite collection of the cover.
(ii) To directly show that g is not universal we need to come up with a space
and map to R/Z where g pulledbacked along this map is not a quotient map. Our
candidate is the following: Let t(R/Z) be the set R/Z with the topology where U
(written as if it is in R) is said to be open if (a) Z 6⊂ U or (b) U contains Z and is
a neighborhood (in the typical topology) of (Z − {finitely many or no points}).
Remark: this topology was used in Day and Kelly’s paper (in the proof of their
theorem), however they defined the topology using a filter and we have merely
rephrased it for convenience.
Define κ : t(R/Z) → R/Z by the set identity map; this is a continuous map.
As a set, the pullback of domain(g) along κ is R but since it now has the
limit topology, we denote the pullback as t(R); in particular, t(R) is R with
the discrete topology. Denote the projection maps as g ′ : t(R) → t(R/Z) and
κ′ : t(R) → R.

15

We claim that g ′ is not a quotient map, i.e. there is some non-open set B
in t(R/Z) with (g ′ )−1 (B) open in t(R). Since every (g ′ )−1 (B) is open in t(R),
then we merely need to find a B that is not open in t(R/Z); B = {Z} obviously
works.
The above example shows us that quotient maps of the form X → X/A may
not generate universal colim sieves. So let’s understand these special quotient
maps a little better. Specifically, using Day and Kelly’s theorem, we can completely state what kinds of subspaces A yield universal quotient maps X → X/A:
Corollary 4.22. The quotient map π : X → X/A is universal if and only if
both of the following properties hold:
1. If A is not open, then for every open cover {Gα }α∈Λ of (∂A) ∩ A in X
there is a finite collection {α1 , . . . , αn } ⊂ Λ with A ∪ Gα1 ∪ · · · ∪ Gαn open
in X.
2. If A is not closed, then for every open U in X such that U ∩ (A − A) 6= ∅,
U ∪ A is open in X.
Proof. We will be using Theorem 4.13 in two ways: first by finding the necessary conditions for π to be a universal quotient map (i.e. proving the forward
direction) and then second by checking the sufficient conditions in the three
cases (i) x = A, (ii) x ∈ X − A, and (iii) x ∈ A − A (i.e. proving the backward
direction).
First suppose that π is a universal quotient map. To see that the first
property is necessary, assume that (∂A) ∩ A 6= ∅, i.e. A is not open, and we
have an open cover {Gα }α∈Λ of (∂A) ∩ A. Then we can expand this cover
to an open cover of A by adding Int(A) to {Gα }α∈Λ . Now by assumption
(using the point A in X/A) there is a finite subcollection Gα1 , . . . , Gαn , Int(A)
such that πGα1 ∪ · · · ∪ πGαn ∪ πInt(A) is a neighborhood of A in X/A. But
πInt(A) ⊂ πGα since Gα ∩ A 6= ∅ and so Int(A) is not necessary in our finite
subcollection. Thus πGα1 ∪ · · · ∪ πGαn is a neighborhood of A; let U be an open
subset of
SnπGα1 ∪ · · · ∪ πGαn containing A. Now by looking at the preimages of
U and i=1 πGαi in X, we get that
A⊂π

−1

(U ) ⊂ π

−1

(

n
[

πGαi ) = Gα1 ∪ · · · ∪ Gαn ∪ A.

i=1

Since π −1 (U ) is open, then the above expression implies A ⊂ Int(Gα1 ∪ · · · ∪
Gαn ∪ A). But since all of the Gα are open, then Gα1 ∪ · · · ∪ Gαn ∪ A is open.
Therefore, the first property is necessary.
To see that the second property is necessary, assume that A is not closed
and U is any open neighborhood of a fixed x ∈ A − A in X. Since U is an open
cover of π −1 (π(x)) = x, then by Theorem 4.13, πU is a neighborhood of x; let
V be an open subset of πU that contains x. Then by looking at the preimages
of V and πU , we see (using that U intersects A nontrivially) that
A ⊂ π −1 (V ) ⊂ π −1 (πU ) = U ∪ A.
16

But since π −1 (V ) is open, then A ⊂ Int(U ∪ A), i.e. U ∪ A is open. Therefore,
the second condition is necessary.
Second let’s assume the two conditions hold. We will show π is a universal
quotient map by checking that the conditions of Theorem 4.13 hold in all three
locations in X/A (i.e. for (i) x = A, (ii) x ∈ X − A, and (iii) x ∈ A − A).
(i) For A ∈ X/A, take any open cover {Gα }α∈Λ of A in X. If A is open
in X, then {A} is open in X/A and hence every πGα is a neighborhood. If A
is not open,
 the finite portion of Λ that property 1 guarantees exists,
S let Γ be
G
is open in X and each Gαi intersects A nontrivially. This
i.e. A ∪
α
i
i∈Γ
S
implies that i∈ΓπGαi is an open neighborhood of A in X/A (since its preimage
S
is A ∪
i∈Γ Gαi ).
(ii) Any x ∈ X − A has an open neighborhood Ux ⊂ X − A. Notice that π
is a homeomorphism on X − A. Thus for any such x and any open cover W of
π −1 (x) = x in X, πW is a neighborhood of x because the open neighborhood
(in X/A) Ux ∩ W is contained in πW .
(iii) If A is closed, then this is trivial so assume that A is not closed and let
x ∈ A − A. For any open cover W of π −1 (x) = x in X, π −1 (πW ) = W ∪ A,
which is open in X by condition 2. Thus πW is an open neighborhood of x in
X/A.
Therefore, our two conditions ensure that π satisfies Day and Kelly’s universal quotient map condition.
Corollary 4.22 now gives us a way to produce more examples of sieves in the
canonical topology:
Example 4.23. Every quotient of a Hausdorff space by a compact subspace
is universal. For example, π : Dn → S n (where S n = Dn /∂Dn ) generates a
universal colim sieve.
Example 4.24. If A is closed, then S = h{X → X/A}i is always a colim sieve.
Moreover, it is universal if and only if ∂A is compact. For example, this tells us
h{R → R/[0, ∞)}i is in the canonical topology and reaffirms that h{R → R/Z}i
is not.

Universal Colim Sieves in the Category of Rmodules

The category of R-modules does not satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 2.8 or
Theorem 2.9. Indeed, coproducts and pullbacks of R-modules do not commute
(for example, let Z(a,b) denote the domain of Z → Z2 , 1 7→ (a, b), then we see
that (Z(1,0) ⊕Z(0,1) )×Z2 Z(1,1) ∼
= Z but (Z(1,0) ×Z2 Z(1,1) )⊕(Z(0,1) ×Z2 Z(1,1) ) ∼
= 0).
Thus we do not have basis and presentation results. Instead, we have some
smaller results, reductions and examples.
Notation 5.1. Let R be a commutative ring with identity. We will use R-Mod
for the category of R-modules and Ab for the category of abelian groups.
17

We start with some basic results.
Corollary 5.2. Any sieve containing a universal effective epimorphism (e.g. a
surjection in R-Mod or in Sets) is a universal colim sieve.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.5 and Corollary 2.4.
Lemma 5.3. In R-Mod, if a sieve S on X can be generated by at most two
morphisms, then the canonical map c : colim U → X is an injection.
−−−→
S

Proof. Suppose S = h{f : Y → X, g : Z → X}i and c(x) = 0. M
Since every map
in S either factors through f or g, then x, as an element of
A, is really
A→X∈S

an element (y, z) ∈ Y ⊕ Z in the colimit. So c(x) = 0 implies that y + z = 0
in X, i.e. (y, −z) ∈ Y ×X Z. Thus y ∈ Y gets identified with −z ∈ Z in the
colimit; hence (y, z) = (0, z − z) = 0 in the colimit. Therefore, x = 0 in the
colimit and the map c is an injection.
0
Using the fact that h{Ai → X}α i = h{Ai → X}α ∪ {Z −
→ X}i, we can say
that any sieve generated by one morphism is also generated by two morphsims.
This completes the proof.
Proposition 5.4. In R-Mod, let
S = h{f : Y → X}i

and

T = h{g : U → X, h : V → X}i

be sieves on X. Then
1. S is a universal colim sieve if and only if f is a surjection.
2. T is a colim sieve if and only if g ⊕ h : U ⊕ V → X is a surjection.
Proof. For part 2, Lemma 5.3 tells us that we only need to worry about the
surjectivity of colim U → X but this is exactly what the above condition is.
−−−→
T
For part 1, Lemma 5.3 and Lemma 2.1 tell us that we only need worry
π1
A (the generator of k ∗ S) for every map
about the surjectivity of A ×X Y −→
k : A → X. But A ×X Y = {(a, y) ∈ A × Y | k(a) = f (y)}. Hence π1 is a
surjection for every map k if and only if f is a surjection.
Lemma 5.5. In R-Mod, suppose S = h{fi : Mi → R}i∈I i is a sieve on R such
that for every i ∈ I there exists an ai ∈ R with im(fi ) = ai R. If the ideal
(ai | i ∈ I) equals R, then for every R-module homomorphism g : N → R, the
natural map colimg∗ S U → N is a surjection.
−−−→
Proof. By Proposition 2.2 it suffices to show that η : ⊕i Mi ×R N → N is a
surjection. Let πi : Mi ×R N → N be the natural map. Fix x ∈ N . Then
ai g(x) ∈ ai R = im(fi ) and ai g(x) ∈ im(g). Thus ai · x ∈ im(πi ) ⊂ N for all
i ∈ I. Therefore, x = 1R · x is in ⊕i im(πi ) = im(η) since R is a unital ring and
(ai | i ∈ I) = R.
18

Proposition 5.6. Suppose S = h{f1 : M1 → R, f2 : M2 → R}i is a sieve on R
such that im(fi ) = ai R for i = 1, 2. Then S is in the canonical topology on
R-Mod if and only if (a1 , a2 ) = R.
Proof. If S is in the canonical topology, then S is a colim sieve and hence by
Proposition 5.4, a1 R ⊕ a2 R = R.
If (a1 , a2 ) = R, then by Proposition 5.4, S is a colim sieve. The universality
of S follows immediately from Lemma 2.1, Proposition 5.4 and Lemma 5.5.
Next we include two results that can help us identify when a sieve is not in
the canonical topology.
Proposition 5.7. Let R be any nonzero ring. Let S = h{fi : Ai → X}i∈I i be
any sieve on X for any nonzero R-module X. If there exists a nonzero b ∈ X
such that spanR (b) ⊂ (X − ∪I Im(fi )) ∪ {0}, then S is not a universal colim
sieve.
Proof. Suppose such a b ∈ X exists. Define g : R → X by 1 → b. Then Im(g) ∩
Im(fi ) = {0} for all i. Thus for all i, the pullback R ×X Ai = ker(g) × ker(fi )
and the image of the natural map R ×X Ai → R is ker(g). In particular,
Im (⊕i R ×X Ai → R) = ker(g), which by construction is not R. Therefore,
colimg∗ S U → R is not surjective and so g ∗ S not a colim sieve on R.
−−−→
Proposition 5.8. Let R be an infinite principal ideal domain. Let
mi
֒→ Rn | mi < n}N
S = h{gi : Rn ֒→ Rn }M
i=1 i
i=1 ∪ {fi : R

be a sieve on Rn . If S is a universal colim sieve, then g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gM : RnM → Rn
is a surjection.
Proof. Let G = g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gM . Suppose that G is not a surjection. We will
produce a map φ that shows S is not universal.
By a change of basis (which is allowable by Lemma 2.3) we may assume that
G = diag(d1 , d2 , . . . , dn ) with di |di+1 . Because G is not surjectve, then dn is
not a unit. Indeed, if dn was a unit, then all of the di ’s would also be units and
thus G would be surjective. By Lemma 5.9 below, there exists an x ∈ Rn−1 so
that spanR {(x, 1)} ∩ Im(fi ) = {0} for all i = 1, . . . , N . Additionally, since dn
is not a unit, then (x, 1) 6∈ Im(G).
Define φ : R → Rn by 1 7→ (x, 1). We will show that φ∗ S is not a colim
sieve. First we will simplify the generating set of φ∗ S. By the choice of x, the
pullback module of Rmi along φ is {0} for all i = 1, . . . , N . Therefore, we can
write φ∗ S as φ∗ S = h{πi : Rn ×Rn R → R}M
i=1 i where the πi are the pullbacks
of the gi along φ. Since (x, 1) 6∈ Im(G) and we have the following commutative

−−∗−→
φ S

φ∗ S is not a colim sieve.
Lastly, for completeness we include the linear algebra result referenced in
Proposition 5.8.
Lemma 5.9. Let R be an infinite principal ideal domain. For any finite collection V1 , . . . , VN of submodules of Rn with dim(Vi ) < n, there exists an x ∈ Rn−1
such that spanR {(x, 1)} ∩ Vi = {0} for all i.
Proof. Let F be the quotient field of R. Let
Wi = Vi ⊗R F.
We will use F n−1 to refer to the subspace {(a1 , . . . , an−1 , 0) | ai ∈ F } in F n .
For each Vi 6⊂ F n−1 , fix an element νi ∈ Vi such that νi 6∈ F n−1 and write
νi = (vi1 , . . . , vin ). Let νi0 = (vi1 , . . . , vi(n−1) , 0). Lastly, for each Vi 6⊂ F n−1 ,
define a vector space map φi : Wi → F n−1 by w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) 7→ w − vwinn νi
Ideally, we will find an x such that (x, 1) 6∈ Wi for all i. So first, let’s see
what kinds of (z, 1) are in Wi by computing φi (z, 1).
φi (z, 1) = (z, 1) −
=z−

1
νi
vin

1 0
ν
vin i

Thus
z = φi (z, 1) +

1 0
ν .
vin i

Therefore, if (z, 1) ∈ Wi , then z = φi (z, 1) + v1in νi0 . Based on this result, define
Γi = im(φi ) ⊕ spanF {νi0 }. So (z, 1) ∈ Wi implies z ∈ Γi .
For each index i exactly one of the following is true:
1. Wi ⊂ F n−1 ,
2. Wi 6⊂ F n−1 and dimF (Γi ) < n − 1,
3. Wi 6⊂ F n−1 and Γi = F n−1 .
For every index j in collection 1, every x ∈ Rn−1 satisfies the equation
spanR {(x, 1)} ∩ Vj = {0}. Thus when picking our x, we only need to consider
the indices in collections 2 and 3.
For each index i in collection 2, Γi is a proper subspace of F n−1 . Since
there are only finitely many Γi and F is an infinite field, then there exists
a y = (y1 , . . . , yn−1 ) such that y 6= 0 and spanF {(y, 0)} ∩ Γi = {0} for all
i in collection 2. By multiplying y by an appropriate s ∈ F we can clear
denominators and so we may assume that y ∈ Rn−1 . In particular, for all
r ∈ R, ry 6∈ Γi , which implies that (ry, 1) 6∈ Wi . Therefore, for all r ∈ R,
spanR {(ry, 1)} ∩ Vi = {0} for all indices in collection 2.
20

Continuing with the y from the previous paragraph, we now consider the
indices k in collection 3 and their corresponding Γk . In this situation, (y, 0) ∈ Γk ,
i.e. y = φk (z) + uk νk0 for some z ∈ Wk and uk ∈ F . Since R is an infinite ring
and collection 3 contains finitely many indices k, we can pick a nonzero ρ ∈ R
1
1
such that for all k, ρuk ∈ R and ρuk 6= vkn
. Thus ρy 6= φk (a) + vkn
νk0 for any
a ∈ Wk , which implies that (ρy, 1) 6∈ Wk . Therefore, spanR {(ρy, 1)} ∩ Vk = {0}
for all indices in collection 3.
We can take x = ρy.
Examples
Here we include a few examples and non-examples of sieves in the canonical
topology for various rings R.
Example 5.10. In the category of R-modules every surjective map generates a
universal colim sieve (see Proposition 5.4). As more specific examples, the sieve
π
h{Z −→ Z/nZ | 1 7→ 1}i is in the canonical topology on Ab and in R-Mod,
the sieve h{Rn → R | (a1 , . . . , an ) 7→ a1 }i is in the canonical topology.

sieve h{Z −→ Z, Z −→ Z}i is in the canonical topology; and when the function ·g(x) : C ∞ (R) → C ∞ (R) is the map f (x) 7→ (g · f )(x), then the sieve

Example 5.12. The sieve S = h{R →
and i2 (1) = (0, 1) (in the category of R-modules for nontrivial R) is not in the
canonical topology. By Proposition 5.4, S is clearly a colim sieve so to see that
S is not universal consider the map ∆ : R → R2 , 1 7→ (1, 1). Then for k = 1, 2,
ik pulled back along ∆ yields the zero map z : 0 → R. Hence Lemma 2.1 says
∆∗ S = h{z : 0 → R}i, which is clearly not a colim sieve.
ik
Similarly h{R →
Rn | k = 1, . . . , n}i is a colim sieve but is not in the
canonical topology. (This is also a consequence of Proposition 5.7.)

Example 5.13. Let S = h{fk : Q → Q[t] | fk (1) = 1 + t + · · · + tk }∞
k=1 i in
the category of rational vector spaces. This S is not in the canonical topology.
(This is a direct consequence of Proposition 5.7 using b = t.)
Example 5.14. Let F be an infinite field. In the category of F vector spaces,
a sieve of the form S = h{F mi ֒→ F n | mi ≤ n}M
i=1 i is in the canonical topology
if and only if mi = n for some i if and only if S contains an isomorphism. (This
is a consequence of Proposition 5.8.)
Proposition 5.15. Consider the diagram B1 ֒→ B2 ֒→ B3 ֒→ . . . made with
only injective maps and the direct limit B := colim Bn in R-mod. Let the maps
−−−→
21

ιn : Bn → B be the natural maps into the colimit. Then the sieve h{ιn | n ∈ N}i
is a universal colim sieve.
Proof. Let Γ : N → S by n 7→ ιn . Notice that Γ is a final functor; this is
easy to see since the injectivity of ιn and the maps in our diagram imply that
U exists and colimS U ∼
Bi × B Bj ∼
UΓ ∼
= Bmin(i,j) . Thus colim
= colim
= B.
−−−→S
−−−→
−−−→N
Therefore, S is a colim sieve.
To see that S is universal, let f : X → B and set Xi := X ×B Bi . For each
n ∈ N, ιn and Bn → Bn+1 are both injective maps; this implies that the natural
maps Xn → Xn+1 and Xn → X are also injective maps since the pullback of
an injection in R-Mod is an injection and Xi ∼
= Xi+1 ×Bi+1 Bi . Additionally,
it is an easy exercise to see that the direct limit colim Xi is isomorphic to X.
−−−→
In other words, f ∗ S is the type of sieve described in the assumptions of this
proposition and proved to be a colim sieve in the previous paragraph.
Example 5.16. Take Bn = Rn and let Bn → Bn+1 be the inclusion map
(x1 , . . . , xn ) 7→ (x1 , . . . , xn , 0). Use R∞ to denote the direct limit. Then the
above proposition shows that h{Rn ֒→ R∞ }n∈N i is in the canonical topology on
the category of R vector spaces. (Compare this to Example 4.14.)
Reductions
In this part we prove some reductions that allow us to limit our view (of
sieve generating sets and the maps universality must be checked over) to the
non-full subcategory of free modules with injective maps when R is ‘nice.’ The
first reduction will be reducing the types of sieves we need to look at:
Proposition 5.17 (Reduction 1). In R-Mod, let S be a sieve on X. Then the
following are equivalent
1. S is a universal colim sieve
2. f ∗ S is a universal colim sieve for every surjection f : Y → X
3. f ∗ S is a universal colim sieve for some surjection f : Y → X
Proof. It is obvious that 1 implies 2 and 2 implies 3, so it suffices to show 3
implies 1.
Assume f ∗ S is a universal colim sieve for some fixed surjection f : Y → X.
Set T = h{f : Y → X}i. By Proposition 5.4, T is a universal colim sieve
since f is a surjection. We will now use T together with the Grothendieck
topology’s transitivity axiom to show that S is a universal colim sieve. Notice
that S satisfies the hypotheses of this axiom with respect to T . Indeed, since
every g ∈ T factors as f ◦ k for some k, then g ∗ S = (f k)∗ S = k ∗ (f ∗ S), which
implies that g ∗ S is a universal colim sieve (as f ∗ S is universal) for every g ∈ T .
Therefore, by the transitivity axiom of a Grothendieck topology, S is a universal
colim sieve.

22

To rephrase our first reduction: S is a universal colim sieve on X if and only
if f ∗ S is a universal colim on Rn where f : Rn → X is a surjection (note that n is
not necessarily assumed to be finite). This reduction means that we can restrict
our view to free modules (not necessarily finitely generated). Specifically, we
only need to look at sieves on free modules and check the universality condition
on free modules. Indeed, S is a universal colim sieve on X if and only if for all
g : Y → X, g ∗ S is a universal colim sieve on Y if and only if for all g : Y → X,
(gf )∗ S is a universal colim sieve on Rn for some surjection f : Rn → Y .
Proposition 5.18 (Reduction 2). In R-Mod when R is a principal ideal domain, every sieve on Rn equals a sieve of the form
h{gi : Rmi ֒→ Rn : mi ≤ n}i∈I i
where the gi are injections.
Proof. Let S = h{fi : Ai → Rn }i∈I i be a sieve on Rn . Set
T = h{gi : Im(fi ) → Rn }i∈I i
where the gi ’s are inclusion maps. Since R is a PID and Im(fi ) is a submodule of
Rn , then Im(fi ) ∼
= Rmi for some mi ≤ n. Thus T is of the desired form and we
will show that S = T . First notice that S ⊂ T . To get that T is a subcollection
of S, notice that f˜i : Ai → Im(fi ) (i.e. fi with a different codomain) is split
because f˜i is a surjective map onto a projective module; call the splitting χi .
Hence gi = gi ◦ f˜i ◦ χi = fi ◦ χi implies that T ⊂ S and completes the proof.
To rephrase our second reduction: when talking about sieves on Rn , we
only need to talk about sieves generated by injections of free modules. Thus we
can restrict our view of sieve generating sets to the non-full subcategory of free
modules with injective morphisms.
Our next reduction will also assume R is a principal ideal domain. In particular, fix n and a map f : X → Rn for some R-module X. Then since R is a
PID, we may write
X∼
= Rm ⊕ K
Rm ∼
= Im(f ),
g: R

m

for some m ≤ n, where

K = ker(f ),

f =g+z

n

with

n

→ R an injection and z : K → R the zero map.

Proposition 5.19 (Reduction 3). Let R be a principal ideal domain, S be a
sieve on Rn in R-Mod and f : X → Rn . Then, using the set-up described in
the previous paragraph,
!

colim U =

Moreover, z ∗ S is a universal colim sieve; hence f ∗ S is a colim sieve if and only
if g ∗ S is a colim sieve.
23

Sketch of Proof. By Proposition 5.18, we may assume that S can be written in
the form S = h{ηi : Rpi ֒→ Rn : pi ≤ n}i∈I i. Consider the diagrams X, R and
K defined as:

i∈I (R ×Rn K)
First we look at the objects of X. Since each ηi is injective, then for all i
Rpi ×Rn X ∼
= (Rpi ×Rn Rm ) ⊕ (Rpi ×Rn K)
and for all i, q
(Rpi ×Rn X) ×X (Rpq ×Rn X)
∼
= ((Rpi ×Rn Rm ) ×Rm (Rpq ×Rn Rm )) ⊕ ((Rpi ×Rn K) ×K (Rpq ×Rn K)).
In other words, X ∼
= R ⊕ K. But since colimits “commute” with colimits, then
Coeq(R)
⊕ Coeq(K). Now by Lemma 2.1 and Proposition 2.2, the
Coeq(X) ∼

Next we notice that z ∗ S is a universal colim sieve. Indeed, since ηi is an
injection and z is the zero map, it easily follows that z ∗ S = h{id : K → K}i.
To complete the proof, notice that we have the following commutative diagram
Coeq(X) ∼
= Coeq(R) ⊕ Coeq(K)

where the vertical maps are the obvious canonical maps. This χ = ρ ⊕ κ is an
isomorphism if and only if both ρ and κ are isomorphisms. We have already
24

shown that κ is an isomorphism (as z ∗ S is a universal colim sieve), thus this
diagram implies that χ is an isomorphism if and only if ρ is; hence f ∗ S is colim
sieve if and only if g ∗ S is a colim sieve.
Lastly, we rephrase our third reduction:
Corollary 5.20. When R is a PID, a sieve on Rn is a universal colim sieve if
and only if f ∗ S is a colim sieve for every injection f : Rm → Rn .
All together our reductions basically allow us to work in the subcategory of
free modules with injective morphisms instead of in R-Mod.

5.1

The Category of Abelian Groups

This section will be primarily made up of examples. Additionally, we include a
characterization of sieves on Z and one result for sieves on larger free abelian
groups.
×a

×b

Example 5.21. By Corollary 5.6, h{Z −−→ Z, Z −−→ Z}i is a universal colim
sieve if and only if a and b are relatively prime.
×1

×2

Example 5.22. The sieve S = h{Z −−→ Z/4Z, Z/2Z −−→ Z/4Z}i is a universal
colim sieve on Z/4Z by Corollary 5.2. Additionally, S is not monogenic, i.e. it
cannot be written as a sieve generated by one morphism.
Example 5.23. Let S = h{g : Zn ֒→ Zn } ∪ {fi : Zmi ֒→ Zn | mi < n}N
i=1 i be a
sieve on Zn . Then S is a universal colim sieve if and only if g is a surjection, i.e.
g is an isomorphism. (This is a direct corollary of Proposition 5.8 and Corollary
5.2.)
Ideally, we would like to know a ‘nice’ basis for the canonical topology on
Ab, like the bases in Section 4.1; to start moving towards this ideal, we look at
the simplest free group, Z. In Example 5.21 we see that a relative prime pair
of numbers will generate a universal colim sieve; this is actually true in general,
specifically:
×a

i
Proposition 5.24. Let S = h{Z −−→
Z}N
i=1 i be a sieve on Z. Then S is a
universal colim sieve if and only if gcd(a1 , . . . , aN ) = 1.

Proof. First assume that S is a universal colim sieve. In particular, the map
colimS U → Z is a surjection, i.e. ZN → Z, (x1 , . . . , xN ) 7→ a1 x1 + · · · + aN xN is
−−−→
a surjection. Therefore, (a1 , . . . , aN ) = Z and this proves the forward direction.
Now assume that gcd(a1 , . . . , aN ) = 1. We will break the proof that S is a
universal colim sieve up into several pieces. First we will reduce the proof to
showing that S is a colim sieve. By the reductions (Propositions 5.17, 5.18 and
×k
5.19), universality only needs to be checked along maps of the form f : Z −−→ Z
×b

where k 6= 0. Fix k 6= 0, i.e. fix f , and write Zb for the domain of Z −−→ Z. By
25

Lemma 2.1, f ∗ S = h{πi : Zai ×Z Zk → Zk }N
i=1 i. Moreover, it is easy to see that
ai
the pullback Zai ×Z Zk ∼

, . . . , gcd(a
= 1 and hence f ∗ S
gcd(a1 , . . . , aN ) equals 1, then gcd gcd(a

N ,k)
has the same form as S. Specifically, any argument showing that S is a colim
sieve will similarly show that f ∗ S is a colim sieve. Therefore, it suffices to show
that S is a colim sieve.
To see that S is a colim sieve, i.e. to see that the map colimS U → Z induced
−−−→
by a1 , . . . , aN is an isomorphism, let α = N (N2−1) and notice that

= Cokernel φ : Zα → ZN

for some map φ where the first isomorphism comes from Lemma 2.2 and the last
isomorphism comes from the fact that we are working in an abelian category.
Now this map φ happens to be the third map in the Taylor resolution of Z, i.e.
φ1 in [5]. We make two remarks about this previous sentence: (1) we will not
prove that our φ is [5]’s φ1 , although this is easy to observe, and (2) the Taylor
resolution in [5] is specifically for polynomial rings, not Z, however, both the
definition of the Taylor resolution and the proof that it is in fact a free resolution
are analogous. Here is the end of the Taylor resolution:
φ

(a1 ... aN )

· · · → Zα −
→ ZN −−−−−−−→ Z → Z/(a1 , . . . , aN )Z → 0
Since gcd(a1 , . . . , aN ) = 1, then it follows that (a1 . . . aN ) is a surjection and
Z/(a1 , . . . , aN )Z ∼
= 0. Thus we obtain 0 → Im(φ) → ZN → Z → 0, which is an
exact sequence and hence implies that the cokernel of φ is Z. Additionally, since
(a1 . . . aN ) induced our map colimS U → Z, then this short exact sequence also
−−−→
says that S is a colim sieve.
Because of Proposition 5.24, we can now easily determine when a sieve on
Z is in the canonical topology and we can easily come up with examples; for
×15
×10
×12
example, h{Z −−→ Z, Z −−→ Z, Z −−→ Z}i is in the canonical topology whereas
×15
×50
×20
the sieve h{Z −−→ Z, Z −−→ Z, Z −−→ Z}i is not. One may hope for a similar
n
outcome for sieves on Z when n ≥ 2, however, the Taylor resolution used in
the proof of Proposition 5.24 does not seem to generalize in a suitable manner.
Instead, we have a proposition that may tell us when a potential sieve is not in
the canonical topology.
A

i
Zn }N
Proposition 5.25. Let S = h{Zn −→
i=1 i where Ai is a diagonal matrix
with det(Ai ) 6= 0. Then there exists a map β : Z → Zn such that β ∗ S is not a
colim sieve if and only if gcd(det(A1 ), . . . , det(AN )) 6= 1.

26

Proof. First we set up some notation: Let Ai = diag(a1i , . . . , ani ) and Zni be
the domain of Ai .
To prove the backward direction, suppose that gcd(det(A1 ), . . . , det(AN ))
does not equal 1. We can rephrase the assumptions as aik 6= 0 for all k and
there exists a prime q such that q divides the product a1i . . . ani for all i. Set
β equal to the diagonal embedding, i.e. 1 7→ (1, . . . , 1). Then by Lemma 2.1,
n
β∗S 
= h{fi : Zni ×Zn Z → Z}N
i=1 i. Let ki = lcm(a1i , . . . , ani ) and χi : Z → Z ,
1 7→

is a pullback diagram. Moreover, the prime q divides ki for all i since it divides
a1i . . . ani for all i. Thus gcd(k1 , . . . , kN ) 6= 1. Now by Proposition 5.24, we can
×k

i
Z}N
see that β ∗ S = h{Z −−→
i=1 i is not a universal colim sieve. In particular, the
first part of the proof of Proposition 5.24 shows that β ∗ S is not a colim sieve.
To prove the forward direction, we will prove the contrapositive statement.
So supposethatgcd(det(A1 ), . . . , det(AN )) = 1. Let β : Z → Zn be given as
b1

the matrix  . . To see that β ∗ S = h{fi : Zni ×Zn Z → Z}N

Suppose, like in Proposition 5.25, S = h{Zn −→

is a universal colim sieve, we (only) need to check if f ∗ S is a colim sieve for all
f : Zm ֒→ Zn , 2 ≤ m ≤ n. However, this is still a fair amount of work and it
would be nice if this process could be simplified further.

any assertions in these examples, however, they are all basic computations that
