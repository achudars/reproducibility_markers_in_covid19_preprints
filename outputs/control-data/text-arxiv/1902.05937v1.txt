The floating zone technique is a well-established single crystal growth method in
materials research, able to produce volumetrically large specimens with extremely
high purities. However, traditional furnace designs have relied on heating from highpowered bulb sources in combination with parabolic mirrors, and hence are constrained to transparent growth chambers with large solid angles of optical access.
This results in a stark limitation on achievable processing gas pressures, and in turn
renders a range of compounds unsuitable for crystal growth by the floating zone technique, either due to excessive volatility or due to metastability. Here, we demonstrate
a novel high-pressure laser-based floating zone system (HP-LFZ). The use of lasers for
heating allows implementation of a high-strength metal growth chamber, permitting
greatly enhanced processing pressures over conventional mirror-based designs, with
the current design allowing for pressures up to 1000 bar. We demonstrate a series of
example single crystal growths using this design in pressures up to 675 bar, a significant increase over processing pressures attainable in commercially available floating
zone systems. The general utility of the HP-LFZ is also illustrated via growths of a
range of complex oxides.
