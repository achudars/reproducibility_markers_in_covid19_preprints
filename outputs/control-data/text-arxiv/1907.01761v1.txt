By extending the Cho decomposition method to G(2) gauge group, monopoles of this group are
studied. Since SU(2) and SU(3) are subgroups of G(2), discussions are done mostly based on these
subgroups of G(2). A direct relation between root vectors of G(2) and the associated magnetic
charges is presented by group theoretical issues. In addition, G(2) monopoles are obtained by an
Abelian gauge fixing method, and it is shown that the results agree with the ones we obtain by the
Cho decomposition method.

INTRODUCTION

Monopoles are among the most popular candidates for
describing quark confinement. Therefore, studying their
properties in various gauge groups helps to understand
this phenomenon. G(2), as the smallest simply connected
exceptional group which contains both SU(2) and SU(3)
gauge groups as its subgroups, is an appropriate group
to be studied in this respect. Lattice calculations [1–5]
confirmed the confinement of color sources at intermediate distances for the G(2) gauge group. There are also
some phenomenological discussions and results based on
the thick center vortex model [6–9]. In addition to these
articles where people studied the confinement properties
by vortex configurations, some other studies based on
monopole properties discussed the confinement mechanism [10, 11]. In this article, using Cho decomposition
and Abelian gauge fixing methods, we study monopoles
of G(2) and some of their properties, mainly based on its
SU(2) and SU(3) subgroups.
The decomposition method introduced by FaddeevNiemi [12–14] and the one represented by Cho [15, 16] are
two of the methods which can be applied to decompose
the Yang-Mills fields of the non-Abelian gauge groups.
In these two methods, Yang-Mills fields are decomposed
in terms of the variables which are more appropriate for
describing the theory in the low energy limit and the
confinement regime. In this paper, we extend the Cho
decomposition of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups to the
non-Abelian G(2) gauge group. We show that by Cho
decomposition, one can study topologically properties
of G(2) gauge group and obtain Wu-Yang monopoles.
In addition, a restricted Lagrangian for the confinement
regime can be obtained. Finally, by Abelian gauge fixing, we find monopoles of G(2). The gluon field acquires
a singularity in the vicinity of the points in space where
Abelian gauge fixing fails and magnetic monopoles are
formed. Indeed, there are some points in the space where
the Abelian gauge fixing becomes ill-defined. Topological

defects such as magnetic monopoles [17–20] are extracted
from these points, and some properties of them like their
charges can be obtained by this method.
In Sec. II, a brief review on G(2) gauge group and its
properties are given. Cho decomposition of G(2) is discussed in Sec. III. Then, using this decomposition, we
find monopoles and the magnetic charges of G(2) gauge
group by its SU(2) subgroups. The generalized quantization condition of G(2), which contains two integers and
is determined as a consequence of having two different
types of monopoles, is calculated in this section as well.
In Sec. IV, we extract monopoles of G(2) by Abelian
gauge fixing method. Finally, the summary and discussions are given in Sec. V.

SOME PROPERTIES OF G(2) GAUGE
GROUP

In this section, we review some basic properties of G(2)
gauge group. G(2) is the smallest simply connected exceptional group which is its own universal covering group
with only a trivial center [3, 21, 22]. It has 14 generators
and since the rank of the group is 2, two of the generators
are simultaneously diagonal. It is a subgroup of the real
group SO(7) with rank 3 and 21 generators, and therefore, it is a real group. The determinant of the 7 × 7 real
orthogonal matrices U of the group SO(7) is 1, and
U U † = 1.

(1)

In addition, G(2) elements satisfy a constraint called the
cubic constraint,
Tabc = Tdef Uda Ueb Uf c ,

(2)

where T is a totally antisymmetric tensor, and its nonzero
elements are
T127 = T154 = T163 = T235 = T264 = T374 = T576 = 1. (3)
As a result of the above constraints, the number of generators of G(2) is reduced to 14. The dimensions of the
fundamental and adjoint representations of G(2) are 7
and 14, respectively. Since all G(2) representations are

2
real, representation {7} is equivalent to its complex conjugate, and therefore, G(2) “quarks” and “antiquarks”
are indistinguishable.
SU(2) and SU(3) are subgroups of the G(2) gauge
group. Since G(2) is rank 2 and SU(3) as its subgroup has
the same rank, some properties of G(2) are the same as
SU(3). For example, the second and the third homotopy
groups of G(2) include monopoles and instantons [23–25],
respectively, the same as SU(3). The second homotopy
group of G(2) is
Π2 [G(2)/U (1)2 ] = Π1 [U (1)2 ] = Z2 .

where I and Z3 are the center groups of G(2) and SU(3),
respectively. In contrast to SU(3), G(2) has no center
vortices because it has only a trivial center.
Under SU(3) subgroup transformations, the sevendimensional fundamental representation of G(2) is decomposed into the SU(3) fundamental representations,
{7} = {3} ⊕ {3̄} ⊕ {1}.

(7)

In other words, a G(2) “quark” {7} contains an SU(3)
quark {3}, an SU(3) antiquark {3̄}, and an SU(3) singlet
{1}. We recall that the {3} ⊕ {3̄} contained in the {7}th
dimensional representation of G(2) corresponds to a real
reducible six-dimensional representation of SU(3).
G(2) contains the generators of SU(3) as its subgroup,
and it is possible to choose its generators in such a way
that the SU(3) generators are clearly observed. The
following choices for the eight generators of the sevendimensional fundamental representation of G(2) [21] are
made:


λi
0
,
−λ∗i
(8)
T i = Ni 
0
0
where λi (i = 1, 2, ..., 8) are the 3 × 3 Gell-Mann generators of SU(3). Ni is obtained from the normalization
condition. With this choice of generators, the decomposition of G(2) to its SU(3) subgroup brought in Eq. (7),
is more understandable. The representation we choose
consists of complex numbers. However, it is equivalent
to a representation that is entirely real. With our choice
of basis, the SU(3) subgroup generators T3 and T8 are
diagonal.

It implies that instantons are present in G(2) theory. The

group is

FIG. 1. Root diagram of G(2).

Since the generators of a group can be found by studying the root and weight diagrams of that group, it is
possible to find the remaining generators of G(2) by
this method. If rα is a root, then r−α ≡ −rα is also
a root. The set of positive and negative root vectors
makes the root space R. As mentioned before, the nonAbelian G(2) gauge group has fourteen generators and
the rank of this group is two; therefore, it has twelve
roots rα (α = ±1, ±2, ..., ±6 ∈ R). The root diagram of
G(2) [26] is shown in Fig. (1). Since the rank of G(2) is
2, the root diagram is two dimensional and the vertical
and horizontal axes are shown by r2 and r1 , respectively.
r1 and r4 are two of the simple roots of G(2)√where the
ratio of the lengths of these two vectors are 3 and the
angle between them is π/6. Simple roots are the roots
which are linearly independent, and other roots can be
constructed from them. The following normalization condition is chosen:
X
rαj rαk = δ jk , (j, k = 1, 2),
(9)

where
is the kth component of the root rα . G(2)
contains two Carton generators Hk (k = 1, 2) and twelve
stepping generators Eα (α ∈ R), where they satisfy the
standard form of the commutation relations [26, 27],
[Hj , Hk ] = 0,
[Hk , Eα ] = rαk Eα ,

(α + β = 0).
(otherwise)

(10)

Nα,β are real constants and
E−α = Eα† ,

Hk = Hk† .

(11)

3
The non-Hermitian generators Eα and E−α are proportional to the raising and lowering operators. There is
a one-to-one correspondence between the generators Eα
and the roots rα . Hk ’s are sometimes called the generators corresponding to zero roots.
From Eq. (10), [H1 , H2 ] = 0; therefore, it is possible
to diagonalize these two matrices simultaneously. For
any representation of G(2), for diagonalized generators
Hk (k = 1, 2), the following eigenvalue equation is applied:
Hk |ma i =

mka |ma i,

(a = 1, 2, ..., dIR ).

(12)

The vector ma is called the weight, and mka is the kth
component of the weight ma . The eigenstates of any representation of G(2) are shown by |ma i, which are defined
by the weight vectors. The number of weights is denoted
by dIR —the dimension of the representation. Weight diagrams are constructed by weight vectors. The generators
of the fundamental representation of G(2) are found by
using root and weight diagrams in some papers [21, 26].
In the Appendix, we bring another form of the G(2) generators. Indeed, rather than working with real generators
Hk and Eα , we prefer to work with Ti (i = 1, 2, ..., 14)
generators: T3 = H1 , T8 = H2 and other Ti ’s which are
complex combinations of generators Eα ’s (A.2). The first
eight generators of Ti have the typical form of Eq. (8).
We show that from this form of Ti ’s, we can learn many
interesting properties of SU(2) and SU(3) subgroups of
G(2).

III.

CHO DECOMPOSITION OF G(2)

The nonzero second homotopy group of G(2) discussed
in the last section, confirms the existence of monopoles.
There are some various methods for extracting topological structures such as monopoles. Cho decomposition is
one of these methods in which the Yang-Mills fields are
decomposed in terms of variables that are more appropriate for describing the theory in the confinement regime.
Since the theory is restricted, the dynamical degrees of
freedom are reduced, and a self-consistent and nontrivial subset of the original gauge theory is provided. As a
result of this decomposition, the original Yang-Mills theory turns into electrodynamics with magnetic monopoles.
Cho decomposition and Abelian gauge fixing are the two
methods that we use and apply to G(2) gauge group to
find monopoles and their properties in this article.
First, we review Cho decomposition for the simplest
gauge group, SU(2) [15]. We assume that vectors
n̂1 , n̂2 , n̂3 = n̂ are the local orthonormal SU(2) basis,
where n̂ is an isotriple vector field that gives the Abelian
direction at each space-time point. A Cho decomposition
for SU(2) Yang-Mills field Aµ , is obtained by assuming
that in the low energy limit,
Dµ n̂ = (∂µ + gAµ ×)n̂ = 0,

(13)

where g is the Yang-Mills coupling constant. The condition (13) makes a restriction on Aµ . We characterize
the restricted Yang-Mills field by Âµ . The condition of
Eq. (13) indicates that the restricted Yang-Mills field is
a field which leaves n̂ invariant under parallel transport.
Âµ is obtained by solving Eq. (13),
1
Aµ −→ Âµ = Aµ n̂ − n̂ × ∂µ n̂,
g

Aµ = n̂ · Aµ ,

(14)

where Aµ is the Abelian component of the potential that
is not restricted by Eq. (13). The restricted potential (14)
contains two parts: a nontopological unrestricted part Aµ
which is called the electric potential and a topological restricted part which is related to the magnetic potential.
Therefore in the infrared limit, Âµ dominates and contains electric and magnetic potentials in a dual symmetric way. Using the restricted potential of Eq. (14), the
field strength Ĝµν is given by
Ĝµν = ∂µ Âν − ∂ν Âµ + g Âµ × Âν
= (Fµν + Hµν )n̂,

(15)

where
Fµν = ∂µ Aν − ∂ν Aµ ,

1
Hµν = − n̂ · (∂µ n̂ × ∂ν n̂). (16)
g

Obviously, the field strength Ĝµν , has a dual structure
since it can be decomposed into an electric field strength
Fµν and a magnetic field strength Hµν . In Eq. (16), Fµν
is expressed in terms of the electric potential Aµ . Correspondingly, we can define a magnetic potential Cµ and
express Hµν in terms of this potential
1
Hµν = − n̂ · (∂µ n̂ × ∂ν n̂) = ∂µ Cν − ∂ν Cµ .
g

(17)

Indeed, Aµ and Cµ are electric and magnetic contributions of the gluon field Âµ , respectively. The singularity
observed as a monopole in the color direction n̂ is expected from the statement Π2 (SU (2)/U (1)) = Π2 (S 2 ) =
Z. We choose Aµ = 0 and a hedgehog form for n̂ (color
direction correlated with configuration direction),


sin θ cos ϕ
n̂ = n̂3 = r̂ =  sin θ sin ϕ  .
(18)
cos ϕ
From Eq. (17), the magnetic field strength is given by
1
Hµν = − sin θ(∂µ θ∂ν ϕ−∂ν θ∂µ ϕ) = ∂µ Cν −∂ν Cµ . (19)

We can consider Cµ =

Cθ = Cr = 0,

Cϕ =

1 (1 + cos θ)

g r sin θ

(20)

4
Therefore, the magnetic potential has a singularity at θ =
0. In 4D, this magnetic potential describes a static WuYang monopole located at the origin with a Dirac string
along the positive z axis. Since the system is Abelianized
(diagonalized) in the third axis direction in color space
(n̂ = n̂3 ), we can write the singular part of the gluon field
as the following:
Â = Âa Ta −→ ÂS = CTd =

1 (1 + cos θ) σ3
( )ϕ̂, (21)
g r sin θ
2

where a sum on “a = 1, 2, 3” in color space is denoted
and Td indicates the diagonal generator of SU(2), which
is σ3 /2. Therefore, the magnetic charge associated to the
pointlike monopole in SU(2) is
gm

4π σ3
=
( ),
g 2

(22)

which corresponds to the diagonal generator of the group.
We recall that choosing n̂ = ±r̂ gives monopole (antimonopole).
Later, Cho also applied this decomposition to SU(3)
Yang-Mills fields [29, 30]. In this section, we extend
this method to decompose the Yang-Mills field of G(2)
gauge group. We consider the direction vectors n̂i (i =
1, 2, ..., 14) as the local orthonormal G(2) basis corresponding to the generators Ti ’s brought in the Appendix.
The Abelian directions are assumed to be n̂3 = n̂ and
n̂8 = n̂′ corresponding to the diagonal generators T3 and
T8 , respectively. These two Abelian directions are represented by a two-dimensional vector n,
n = (n̂, n̂′ ).

(23)

where n̂p (p = 1, 2, ..., 6) are Abelian directions of SU(2)
subgroups, which are combinations of Abelian directions

Comparing Eq. (27) with root vectors of G(2) in Fig. (1),
we can expand n̂p in terms of positive root vectors,
n̂p = n · rp ,

where we show positive root vectors of G(2) by rp . Indeed, rp = rα>0 . We can express the restricted potential (25) in terms of Abelian directions n̂p and the corresponding Abelian potentials Apµ ,
Âµ = 2

Dµ n̂′ = 0.

(24)

Indeed, the first condition automatically guarantees the
second condition and n̂′ ∝ n̂ ∗ n̂, where the star denotes
the symmetric d product [29]. By solving Eq. (24), a
restricted potential for G(2) gauge group is found,
1

Âµ = Aµ n̂ − n̂ × ∂µ n̂ + A′µ n̂′ − n̂′ × ∂µ n̂′ ,

(25)

where Aµ = n̂ · Aµ and A′µ = n̂′ · Aµ are Abelian components of the potential. It is obvious that the restricted
potential contains two parts, the Maxwell part and the
Dirac part.
As we show in the Appendix (A.3), the space of G(2)
can be covered by six SU(2) subgroups. Thus, for the
corresponding local directions in the internal space, we
can define the six following categories:

We recall that the Einstein summation rule is not applied.
This representation of restricted potential has a compact
form and contains six SU(2) restricted potentials. Because of summation on p, they are not independent.
Back to the potential of Eq. (25), the field strength can
be obtained

Since G(2) contains two Abelian directions, Cho condition is given by
Dµ n̂ = 0,

(28)

Ĝµν = ∂µ Âν − ∂ν Âµ + g Âµ × Âν

are expressed in terms of the

potentials determine the non–Abelian monopoles. This
represents a duality between electric and magnetic potentials. Therefore, we can redefine Ĝµν in terms of Abelian
potentials Bµ and Bµ′ , the dual potentials. One can also
define the field strength in terms of Abelian directions

This restricted Lagrangian contains the non-Abelian
monopole degrees of freedom explicitly, and hence, it is
possible to study the dynamics of monopole gauge, independently.
In the beginning of this section, we have had a review
on Cho decomposition of the SU(2) gauge group. And
by choosing the Abelian direction of this group in the
r̂ direction, we have found a pointlike monopole with
Dirac string along the positive z axis. Now, we use
the method introduced by Cho to find G(2) monopoles.
SU(2) contains one Abelian direction, but G(2) contains two Abelian directions. To find monopoles of G(2),
we consider SU(2) subgroups of G(2) where each subgroup has only one Abelian direction. We recall that
G(2) can be covered by six SU(2) subgroups. The color
spaces of SU(2) subgroups of G(2) are the same as the
color space of SU(2) gauge group. Therefore, to find
monopoles of SU(2) subgroups, we can do the same discussions and calculations as what we have done for the

1 1 (1 + cos θ)
.
| n̂p |2 g r sin θ

(35)

This describes a pointlike monopole at the origin with
a Dirac string along the positive z axis for each SU(2)
subgroup. Since the subgroups are Abelianized in n̂p directions, near each monopole, the singularity of the gluon
field is given by

SU(2) gauge group. Monopoles of SU(2) subgroups arise
from the magnetic part of the field strength Ĝµν defined
in Eq. (32) and Eq. (33). Hedgehog shapes for Abelian
directions of SU(2) subgroups are obtained by choosing
1 1
n̂p =| n̂p | r̂ and Cµp =
(1 + cos θ)∂µ ϕ as a mag| n̂p |2 g

these magnetic potentials are

(36)

where Td (d = p = 1, 2, ..., 6) are diagonal generators
of SU(2) subgroups brought in Eq. (A.3). The summation on p in Eq. (32) and the fact that G(2) has
two Abelian subgroups described by Eq. (4) suggest that
there exist only two independent monopoles for G(2)
gauge group. Therefore, the generalized quantization
condition for G(2) is labeled by two integers N and N ′ ,

with magnetic charges of Eq. (39), it is confirmed that
our choice for Cµp is suitable. We can express magnetic

method. For non-Abelian gauge groups, Abelian gauge
fixing is defined by diagonalizing a suitable scalar field
Φ(x). Hence, for G(2) group,
Ω(x)Φ(x)Ω† (x) = diag[λ1 (x), λ2 (x), ..., λ7 (x)],

where Ω(x) ∈ G(2) is a gauge transformation function
which represents a local rotation in color space of G(2).
λi ’s are eigenvalues of diagonalized Φ(x), and there exist
seven of them, since we work in seven-dimensional fundamental representation of G(2). The scalar field Φ(x)
is defined as the following:

(41)

Indeed, H·rp are diagonal generators of SU(2) subgroups
(A.3). By comparing magnetic charges of Eq. (40) with
roots of Fig. (1), we find out a beautiful concept behind
the root diagram, which is a correspondence between the
root vectors and magnetic charges. Magnetic charges g1 ,
g2 , and g3 in Eq. (40) are equivalent to the magnetic
charges of SU(3) [20], as one of the subgroups of G(2).
They could easily be predicted by studying the roots r1 ,
r2 , and r3 of Fig. (1). These three roots form the root
diagram of SU(3) gauge group[26].
In the next section, we briefly review Abelian gauge
fixing method, and then we extract monopoles and their
magnetic charges for G(2) gauge group by this method.

IV. ABELIAN GAUGE FIXING AND
MAGNETIC MONOPOLES OF THE G(2)

In the Abelian gauge fixing, QCD is reduced into an
Abelian gauge theory, where QCD monopoles appeared
[17–20]. In this section, we find monopoles of G(2) by this

(45)

and we use the following appropriate definitions:
t1 =

(43)

where Ta (a = 1, 2, ..., 14) are generators of G(2) and
Φa (x)’s are the components of Φ in color space. Since
the generators Ta are traceless Hermitian matrices, the
field Φ(x) = Φa (x)Ta and also the diagonalized form of
it which is given in Eq. (42) are traceless matrices. The
Abelian gauge fixing becomes ill-defined at some points
in space. At these points, λi (i = 1, 2, ..., 7) eigenvalues
in Eq. (42) become degenerate, the gluon field Aµa turns
singular and magnetic monopoles appear. We investigate
these degenerate points in G(2) space and find monopoles
and their associated monopole charges.
For this purpose, we study degenerate points of the
SU(2) subspaces of G(2). In the vicinity of each one of
the degeneracy points, there are at least two degenerate eigenvalues and the matrix Φ(x) is not diagonalized
completely. By expressing the scalar field Φ(x) in terms
of SU(2) subgroups, we obtain six different forms for
Φ(x) since G(2) contains six SU(2) subgroups brought in
Eq.(A.3). We also find out that there are six possible degenerate cases since we can consider one degenerate case
corresponds to each one of these scalar fields. For the first
degenerate case which arises from (1/2T1, 1/2T2 , 1/2T3)
subgroup, the scalar field is written in the following form:

degenerate points give monopoles in the Abelian gauge
in terms of x-coordinate frame. In spherical coordinates,
the scalar field is written in the following form:

Studying other degeneracies of the eigenvalues, one can
obtain other pointlike monopoles of G(2). The calculation method is the same as what we have done for the first
and the fourth cases. Thus, by applying Abelian gauge
fixing method for G(2), six monopoles with magnetic
charges given in Eq. (40) is observed. However, as we
have already discussed, only two of those six monopoles
are independent. This result is in agreement with what
we have obtained by the Cho decomposition method.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, monopoles of the G(2) gauge group as
a smallest simply connected gauge group are studied.
Two well-known methods: the Cho decomposition and
Abelian gauge fixing are applied to extract these topological defects existing in the low energy limit of QCD.
Using both the Cho decomposition and Abelian gauge
fixing methods, monopoles of G(2) are derived, and it is
shown that the results of the two methods are the same.
Generators of G(2) which are obtained in some previous
papers are rearranged in such a way that the SU(2) and
SU(3) decomposition contributions of G(2) fundamental
representation are observed more easily.

Tehran for supporting this study.

Appendix A: G(2) generators

In this Appendix, the generators of G(2) fundamental
representation are represented. In the papers [21, 26],
the generators of this representation are found as the
following:

E1 = √ (|1ih2|−|5ih4|),
2 2

E2 = √ (|1ih3|−|6ih4|),

4
1
H2 = √ (|1ih1|+|2ih2| − 2|3ih3|−|4ih4|−|5ih5|
4 3
+ 2|6ih6|),
where |ma i(a = 1, 2, ..., 7) stand for the eigenstates of the
fundamental representation of G(2) obtained in Eq. (12).

The above stepping generators are real, but we would like
the eight generators of G(2) to have the complex form of
Eq. (8), such that the SU(3) decomposition of G(2) is
explicitly observed. For this purpose, we use the Ti (i =
1, 2, ..., 14) rather than Hk and Eα as generators of the
fundamental representation of G(2). These generators
are obtained from the the following equations:

1
1
E±1 = √ (T1 ± iT2 ), E±2 = √ (T4 ± iT5 ),
2
2
1
1
E±3 = √ (T6 ± iT7 ), E±4 = √ (T9 ± iT10 ),

E±5 = √ (T11 ± iT12 ), E±6 = √ (T13 ± iT14 ),
2
2
H1 = T 3 , H 2 = T 8 .
(A.2)

The normalization condition is defined as tr(Ti Tj ) =
1/4δij . From this form of Ti ’s, one can learn many interesting properties of SU(2) and SU(3) subgroups of
G(2). With this representation, it is obvious that the
first eight generators of G(2) contain SU(3) generators,
λi (i = 1, 2, ..., 8), as presented in Eq. (8). In addition, the
decomposition of G(2) to its SU(3) subgroup brought in
Eq. (7) is more understandable.

The space of G(2) can be covered with six SU(2) subgroups,
