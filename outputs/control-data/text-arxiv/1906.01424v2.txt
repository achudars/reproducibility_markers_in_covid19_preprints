arXiv:1906.01424v2 [math.DG] 23 Dec 2019

Abstract. In this paper, we study how the notions of geometric formality according to Kotschick
and other geometric formalities adapted to the Hermitian setting evolve under the action of the
Chern-Ricci flow on class VII surfaces, including Hopf and Inoue surfaces, and on Kodaira surfaces.

Introduction
This note is related to the problem of understanding the algebraic structure of cohomologies of
complex manifolds.
On a differentiable manifold X, the differential complex of forms has a structure of algebra. The
wedge product induces an algebra structure in de Rham cohomology, but not in a uniform way.
We mean that, in general, it is not possible to choose a system of representatives having itself a
structure of algebra. This is evident if we want to choose harmonic representatives with respect to
a Riemannian metric on a compact differentiable manifold: indeed, in the words of Sullivan, there
is an “incompatibility of wedge products and harmonicity of forms” [Sul78, page 326]. In general,
on a compact differentiable manifold X, the choice of representatives for the de Rham cohomology
yields just a structure of A∞ -algebra in the sense of Stasheff [Sta63], by the Homotopy Transfer
Principle by Kadeishvili [Kad80], see e.g. [Zho00, Mer99]. We refer to [LPWZ09, BMFM18] for
understanding the relationship between the higher multiplications and the Massey products. When
such an A∞ -algebra is actually an algebra, we say that X is formal in the sense of Sullivan [Sul78].
In this case, the differential graded algebra of forms and the dga of de Rham cohomology share the
same minimal model, which contains information on the rational homotopy: therefore the rational
• (X; R); see [Sul78]
homotopy type of X “can be computed formally from” the cohomology ring HdR
for details. As a special case, when we can fix a Riemannian metric g such that the harmonic
representatives with respect to g have a structure of algebra, say that X is geometrically formal in
the sense of Kotschick [Kot01].
On a complex manifold X, the double complex of forms (∧•,• X, ∂, ∂) has a structure of bidifferential bi-graded algebra. Then it is possible to investigate analogous notions for the Dolbeault
cohomology. Neisendorfer and Taylor introduced the notion of (strictly) Dolbeault formality and
“complex homotopy groups” in [NT78]; for Hermitian manifolds, the notion of (strictly) geometricDolbeault formality has been investigated by Tomassini and Torelli in [TTo14].

[Aep65] cohomologies provide further cohomological invariants on complex manifolds.
They are directly related by morphisms to both the Dolbeault and the de Rham cohomology, and
allow to numerically characterize the strong Hodge decomposition given by the ∂∂-Lemma [ATo13,
ATa17]. The notion of geometrically-Bott-Chern formality for Hermitian manifolds is introduced
and studied in [ATo15]. Here, Bott-Chern-harmonic forms are in the kernel of the fourth-order
Bott-Chern Laplacian introduced in [KS60, Sch07]. On the other side, it is not clear how to study a
notion of “Bott-Chern and Aeppli formality”. However, the Bott-Chern cohomology has a structure
of algebra, while the Aeppli cohomology is just a HBC (X)-module. We refer to the discussion in
[ATa17, Ang15].
In this note, we focus on geometric formalities of complex manifolds and its dependence on the
Hermitian metric. In [TTo14, TaT17], the authors study the behaviour of Dolbeault formality,
respectively geometric-Bott-Chern formality, under small deformations of the complex structure.
Here, we keep the complex structure fixed, and we study geometric formalities with respect to
Hermitian metrics evolving along a geometric flow. More precisely, we consider the Chern-Ricci
flow [Gil11, TW15] that evolves Hermitian structures ω(t) by the Chern-Ricci form,
∂
ω = −RicCh (ω),
∂t
and we study the possible algebra structure on the space of (de Rham, Dolbeault, Bott-Chern,
Aeppli) harmonic forms with respect to ω(t) varying t.
We study in details geometric formality according to Kotschick for a whole class of surfaces
evolving by the Chern-Ricci flow, i.e. compact complex non-Kähler surfaces with Kodaira dimension
Kod(X) = −∞ and first Betti number b1 (X) = 1, known as class VII of the Enriques-Kodaira
classification. In particular, we first rule out class VII surfaces with second Betti number b2 > 0
by applying arguments as in [Kot01]. Then, we exploit the structure of quotients of Lie groups
with invariant complex and Hermitian structure on the only class VII surfaces with b2 = 0, that is
Hopf and Inoue surfaces see [Bog82, Kod64, LYZ94, Tel94], in order to reduce the description of
harmonic forms and the equation of the Chern-Ricci flow of such surfaces at the level of invariant
forms and thus make explicit computations. We obtain the following.
Theorem 3.1. On class VII surfaces, the Chern-Ricci flow preserves the notion of geometric
formality according to Kotschick starting at initial invariant metrics.
We also study the evolution of geometric formality according to Kotschick on other compact
complex non-Kähler surfaces that are diffeomorphic to solvmanifolds, e.g. Kodaira surfaces. Since
any complex structures on such surfaces is left-invariant, see [Has05, Theorem 1], we focus on
invariant forms also in this case.
Proposition 3.2. On Kodaira surfaces, geometric formality according to Kotschick is preserved by
the Chern-Ricci flow starting at initial invariant metrics.
We note that, also in this case, it is possible to rule out primary Kodaira surfaces by the obstructions in [Kot01] or [Has89], and therefore we focus on secondary Kodaira surfaces with initial
invariant metrics.

Regarding Dolbeault and Bott-Chern geometric formalities evolving by the Chern-Ricci flow, by
applying the analogous procedure on Hopf, Inoue, and Kodaira surfaces, we have reached results
as follows. We also checked how the algebraic structures of Aeppli cohomology and its harmonic
representatives are modified along the Chern-Ricci flow.
Proposition 4.1. On Hopf, Inoue, and Kodaira surfaces, the notions of Dolbeault geometric formality and Bott-Chern geometric formality are all preserved by the Chern-Ricci flow starting at
initial invariant metrics. Moreover the properties of Aeppli-harmonic forms having a structure of
algebra or a structure of HBC -module are all preserved by the Chern-Ricci flow starting at initial
invariant metrics.
Throughout this note, we give a complete description of harmonic forms on such compact complex
surfaces depending on the invariant Hermitian metrics. We made computations with the aid of
SageMath [S+ 09].
We ask whether for Dolbeault and Bott-Chern geometric formalities there exist obstructions
(such as the ones found in [Kot01]) which would help complete the picture for geometric formalities
for class VII surfaces. We also ask whether the behaviour we observed is more general or there
exist counterexamples.

which correspond, by the universal coefficients theorem.
In the case of non-Kähler complex compact manifolds, further invariants regarding the complex

Geometric formalities. In general, whereas de Rham, Dolbeault and Bott-Chern cohomologies
have a structure of algebra induced by the cup product of cohomology classes, the mentioned
isomorphisms (1.2) do not preserve the structure of algebra, expected by the wedge product. For
Aeppli cohomology, especially, we do not have a structure of algebra a priori, but a structure of
HBC (X)-module; the isomorphism in (1.2) could not preserve this structure. This remark makes
non-trivial the following definitions.
Definition 1.1. Let X be a compact complex manifold, g a fixed Hermitian metric on X. The
metric g is said to be

Chern-Ricci flow. The Chern-Ricci flow (introduced in [Gil11] and studied in [TW15]) is a parabolic geometric flow that preserves the Hermitian condition of the initial given metric. The
equations that describe such flow on a Hermitian manifold (X n , J, g0 ) are
∂
ω(t) = −RicCh (ω(t)),
ω(0) = ω0 ,
∂t
where ω0 , ω(t) are the foundamental forms associated, respectively, to the Hermitian initial metric
g0 and the evolution metric g(t) by the usual relation ω(·, ·) = g(J(·), ·). For an arbitrary real
(1, 1)-form ω, RicCh (ω) is the Chern-Ricci form of ω. The first Chern-Ricci curvature RicCh is
defined starting from ∇Ch , the Chern connection on (X, J, g), i.e. the unique connection ∇ on the
holomorphic tangent bundle T 1,0 X such that ∇ is compatible with both g and J and ∇0,1 = ∂.
Ch , for
In a holomorphic chart, the curvature tensor RCh of such connection has components Rijkl
i, j, k, l ∈ {1, . . . , n}. The Chern-Ricci tensor is obtained by contracting the last two indices via the
metric

,
:= g kl Rijkl
ij
where (g kl ) is the inverse of the matrix (gkl ) representing in local coordinates the metric g. The
Chern-Ricci form is defined by
RicCh := RicciCh (J( · ), · ).
Such form has important properties, among which a very simple form in local coordinates:
√
RicCh (ω) = − −1∂∂ log det(g),
from which we can deduce that RicCh (ω) is a ∂-, ∂-closed form, hence it defines a cohomology class
1,1
(X). Such class is a holomorphic invariant, denoted by cBC
in HBC
1 (X), which plays a fundamental
role in the classification of complex manifolds.
2. Preliminaries on compact complex surfaces and quotients of Lie groups
In this section, we analyze in details complex structures, cohomologies, and Chern-Ricci flow on
non-Kähler compact complex surfaces that can be described as quotients of Lie groups G endowed
with invariant complex structure [Has05], namely Hopf, Inoue, and Kodaira surfaces. Here, invariant tensors are meant to be defined on the covering Lie group and invariant by the action of the
Lie group on itself by left-translations, that is, they can be considered as linear tensors over the
associated Lie algebra g.
Complex structure. More precisely, we describe the complex structure J by a coframe of invariant
(1, 0)-forms {ϕ1 , ϕ2 } and their conjugates, and by their structure equations
dϕI = −cIHK ϕH ∧ ϕK ,

6

equivalently, by the dual frame {ϕ1 , ϕ2 } of (1, 0)-vector fields and their conjugates, with structure
equations [ϕH , ϕK ] = cIHK ϕI . (Capital letters here vary in the ordered set (1, 2, 1̄, 2̄) and refer to
the corresponding component. The Einstein summation is assumed, for increasing indices in case
of forms. Hereafter, we shorten e.g. ϕ21̄ := ϕ2 ∧ ϕ̄1 .)

Finally, we collect here some explicit description of the Hodge-star-operator on forms for the

Cohomologies. Consider the inclusion of invariant forms into the double complex of forms,
ι : (∧•,• g∨ , ∂, ∂) ,→ (∧•,• X, ∂, ∂). By choosing an invariant Hermitian metric, (the easier finitedimensional version of) elliptic Hodge theory also applies at the level of invariant forms; in particular, any cohomology class of invariant forms admits a unique invariant harmonic representative. It
follows that the above inclusion induces injective maps in de Rham ιdR , Dolbeault ι∂ , Bott-Chern
ιBC , Aeppli ιA cohomology, see [CF01, Lemma 9]. We claim that they are in fact isomorphisms.
The de Rham cohomology of Hopf, Inoue, Kodaira surfaces is well known, and it happens that
the above maps ιdR are actually isomorphisms, that is, any de Rham class admits an invariant
representative. In fact, the Hopf surface is diffeomorphic to the product S1 × S3 of two compact Lie
groups, so one can use the Künneth formula and e.g. [FOT08, Theorem 1.28]; the primary Kodaira
surface is a nilmanifold, so one can use the Nomizu theorem [Nom54]; the secondary Kodaira
surfaces are quotients of primary Kodaira surfaces by finite groups; the Inoue surface of type S ± is
a completely-solvable solvmanifold, so one can use the Hattori theorem [Hat60]; and the de Rham
cohomology of the Inoue surface of type SM can be computed by exploiting their number-theoretic
construction as [OT05] does in a more general setting.
As for the Dolbeault cohomology, for compact complex surfaces, we know that the Frölicher
k (X; C) =
spectral sequence degenerates at the first page, see e.g. [BHPVdV04], that is, dimC HdR
P
p,q
p+q=k dimC H∂ (X) for any k. By explicitly computing the Dolbeault cohomology of invariant
forms [ADT16], one then notice that the above maps ι∂ are actually isomorphisms.
Finally, Bott-Chern cohomology of compact complex surfaces is well-undestood since [Tel06]. By
[AK17, Theorem 1.3, Proposition 2.2], (that fits in the general theory later developed by [Ste18],)
also ιBC are isomorphisms. Explicit computations can be found in [ADT16]. Finally, ιA are
isomorphisms thanks to the Schweitzer duality between Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies, where
one can use the Hodge-star-operator with respect to an invariant Hermitian metric.
Finally, by uniqueness of the harmonic representative in a cohomology class, we also deduce that
harmonic representatives with respect to invariant metrics are invariant.
Chern-Ricci flow. Recall that the Chern-Ricci form represents the first Bott-Chern class
1,1
1,1
cBC
1 (X) ∈ HBC (X). Since a class in HBC (X) contains only one invariant representative, the
Chern-Ricci form RicCh (ω) does not depend on the invariant Hermitian metric ω. In particular,
the Chern-Ricci flow starting at ω0 reduces to
∂
ω(t) = −RicCh (ω0 ),
ω(0) = ω0 .
∂t
We notice that the solution of the Chern-Ricci flow starting at an invariant metric remains
invariant for any existence time. Indeed, by short existence and uniqueness assured by parabolicity,
the symmetry group is preserved along the flow (and possibly increases in the limit, see e.g. [Lau16]).

3. Geometric formality according to Kotshick
In this section we state the main theorem of this note, regarding class VII surfaces of the EnriquesKodaira classification of compact complex surfaces.
Theorem 3.1. On class VII surfaces of the Enriques-Kodaira classification, geometric formality
according to Kotshick is preserved by the Chern-Ricci flow starting at initial invariant Hermitian
metrics.
Proof. Let X be a class VII surface, that is, Kod(X) = −∞ and b1 (X) = 1. By [Kot01, Theorem
6], for a compact oriented Kotschick-geometrically formal 4-manifold X, the first Betti number
satisfies b1 (X) ∈ {0, 1, 2, 4}. Since all class VII surfaces are non-Kähler, they must have odd
first Betti number by [Buc99, Lam99], that is, b1 (X) = 1. By [Kot01, Theorem 9], the Euler
characteristic of such manifolds vanishes, implying that b2 (X) = 0. Since the characterization
result by [Bog82, Kod64, LYZ94, Tel94], class VII surfaces with b2 (X) = 0 are necessarily Hopf
or Inoue surfaces, then we see that the only Kotschick-geometrically formal class VII surfaces can
be Hopf and Inoue surfaces. Therefore, Chern-Ricci flow starting at any metric cannot produce
geometrically formal metrics on class VII surfaces other than Hopf and Inoue surfaces: we will then
check the statement for those surfaces.
Case 1: Hopf surfaces. Hopf surfaces X are compact complex surfaces in class VII defined as
a quotient of C2 \ {0} by a free action of a discrete group generated by a holomorphic contraction
γ(z, w) = (αz + λwp , βw) where α, β, λ ∈ C and p ∈ N are such that 0 < |α| ≤ |β| < 1 and
(α − β p )λ = 0, see [Lat11], [Ste57, page 820], see [Weh81, Remark 1].
The diffeomorphism type is S1 × SU(2), and the complex structure is a special case of the CalabiEckmann complex structure on product of spheres [CE53]. See also [Par03, Theorem 4.1]. In terms
of a coframe (ϕ1 , ϕ2 ) of (1, 0)-forms, they are described as
√
√
√
dϕ1 = −1ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2 + −1ϕ1 ∧ ϕ̄2 ,
dϕ2 = − −1ϕ1 ∧ ϕ̄1 .

product is still harmonic.

Indeed, it suffices to check that the harmonic representative of the class [ϕ2 − ϕ̄2 ] does not depend
on the invariant metric. This is because harmonic representatives are invariant, and the class
[ϕ2 − ϕ̄2 ] = {ϕ2 − ϕ̄2 + dc : c ∈ R} contains only one invariant representantive, which is then
harmonic with respect to any metric. Then we compute the harmonic representative of the dual
3 (X; R) by applying the Hodge-star-operator to ϕ2 − ϕ̄2 with respect to the arbitrary
class in HdR
Hermitian metric. In any case, the product of an invariant 1-form and an invariant 3-form is either
zero or a scalar multiple of the volume form. It follows that any invariant metric on the Hopf
surface is geometrically formal in the sense of Kotschick.

Chern-Ricci flow. Clearly, on the Hopf surface with invariant Hermitian metrics, the properties of
geometric formality in the sense of Kotschick is preserved along the Chern-Ricci flow. Nonetheless,
for completeness and for later use, we compute the Chern-Ricci form and the Chern-Ricci flow on
X.
We start by computing the Chern-Riemann curvature of an invariant Hermitian metric. We

then the Cher-Ricci form can be defined as

RicCh = (RicCh )ih −1dz i ∧ dz̄ h .
In our case, the only non-trivial coefficients are

We also analyze in details primary and secondary Kodaira surfaces resulting in the following
proposition, for which we give explicit computations.
Proposition 3.2. On any Kodaira surface, the properties of geometric formality in the sense of
Kotschick is preserved along the Chern-Ricci flow starting at initial invariant Hermitian metrics.
Proof. We will look at each case separatedly.
Case 1: Primary Kodaira surface. Kodaira surfaces X are compact complex surfaces of Kodaira
dimension Kod(X) = 0 and first Betti number b1 (X) = 3. Primary Kodaira surfaces have trivial
canonical bundle.
We note that, by [Kot01, Theorem 6], primary Kodaira surfaces are never Kotschick-geometrically
formal, not even with regards to non-invariant metrics, by having b1 = 3: hence Chern-Ricci
flow preserves geometric formality according to Kotschick. The same conclusion follows by [Has89,
Theorem 1] stating that non-tori nilmanifolds are never formal, therefore never geometrically formal
in the sense of Kotschick. Nevertheless we give explicit computations for this fact.
We recall the description of primary Kodaira surfaces as quotients of solvable Lie groups [Has05].

We explicitly notice that, on primary Kodaira surfaces, an invariant Hermitian metric is never
geometrically formal in the sense of Kotschick: indeed, ϕ1 ∧ ϕ1̄2̄ is never harmonic.
As for Chern-Ricci flow, the primary Kodaira surface has trivial canonical bundle, therefore
RicCh (ω) = 0. Then, clearly, the Chern-Ricci flow does not evolve invariant Hermitian metrics.
Case 2: Secondary Kodaira surface. Secondary Kodaira surfaces X are quotients of primary
Kodaira surfaces by finite groups; they have torsion non-trivial canonical bundle.

in (2.1):

RicCh (ω) = 0. Therefore, the Chern-Ricci flow does not evolve invariant Hermitian metrics.

4. Dolbeault and Bott-Chern geometric formalities
As for Dolbeault or Bott-Chern geometric formality, the situation is clear for Hopf, Inoue and
Kodaira surfaces, as we now describe. We also make computations regarding Aeppli cohomology
and harmonic representatives with respect to the Aeppli Laplacian.
Proposition 4.1. On Hopf, Inoue, and Kodaira surfaces, the property of Dolbeault geometric
formality and of Bott-Chern geometric formality is preserved along the Chern-Ricci flow starting

at invariant metrics. In the same situation, the properties of having a structure of algebra or a
structure of HBC -module for harmonic-Aeppli forms are all preserved by the Chern Ricci flow.
Proof. We refer to the complex structures used in Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 3.2, for the computation of Dolbeault, Bott-Chern, and Aeppli cohomologies.
Hopf surfaces. The Dolbeault cohomology of Hopf surfaces is explicitly described in [Hir78, Appendix II, Theorem 9.5], and see [ADT16, Section 3.1] for the Bott-Chern cohomology:

where we have listed the harmonic representatives with respect to the Hermitian metric with fun√
√
damental form 2ω = −1ϕ11̄ + −1ϕ22̄ instead of their classes.
We look at how the harmonic representatives of such cohomologies change with respect to the
invariant Hermitian metric, and in particular when their product is still harmonic.
We summarize them as follows:

HA
Let us focus first on the Dolbeault cohomology. Here, the only Dolbeault-harmonic representative
that changes is for the generator in H∂1,2 (X). We conclude that any invariant Hermitian metric on
the Hopf surface is geometrically-Dolbeault formal.
As regards the Bott-Chern cohomology, to our aim, that is, studying harmonicity of products
of Bott-Chern-harmonic forms, the only case of interest is the product [ϕ11̄ ] ^ [ϕ11̄ ], the products
with the class [1] being trivial and the other products being zero because of degree reasons. Since
the harmonic representatives with respect to invariant metrics are invariant, the Bott-Chern class
[ϕ11 ] = {ϕ11 + ∂∂c : c ∈ R} contains only one invariant representantive, that is also harmonic with
respect to any invariant Hermitian metric. Again, we have that any invariant Hermitian metric on
the Hopf surface is geometrically-Bott-Chern formal.
We consider the Aeppli cohomology. On the one side, we can consider the products between
Aeppli-harmonic forms: the only possibly non-trivial products concern the classes [ϕ2 ] and [ϕ̄2 ],
[ϕ2 ] and [ϕ2 ∧ ϕ̄2 ], [ϕ̄2 ] and [ϕ2 ∧ ϕ̄2 ]. Since the classes [ϕ2 ] and [ϕ̄2 ] contain only one invariant
representative, we are reduced to study how the harmonic representative of the Aeppli cohomology
class [ϕ2 ∧ ϕ̄2 ] depends on the invariant Hermitian metric. The arbitrary representative in the
Aeppli cohomology class [ϕ22̄ ] is

At the end of the day, we get that: Aeppli-hamornic forms have a structure of algebra if and only
if the metric (2.1) is diagonal, namely, u = 0.
Finally, we consider the Aeppli cohomology as a Bott-Chern-cohomology-module. By the Stokes
theorem, there is no invariant exact 4-form other than the zero form; in particular, any invariant
(2, 2)-form is harmonic with respect to any Hermitian invariant metric. This reduces to consider
only the products [ϕ11̄ ]BC ^ [ϕ2 ]A and [ϕ11̄ ]BC ^ [ϕ̄2 ]A . By the argument above, both [ϕ11̄ ]BC and
[ϕ2 ]A , respectively [ϕ̄2 ]A , contain only one invariant representative that is harmonic with respect
to any Hermitian metric. Therefore: for any invariant Hermitian metric on the Hopf surface,
Aeppli-harmonic forms have a structure of module over Bott-Chern-harmonic forms.

As regards the Chern-Ricci flow, we already have an expression for it computed in (3.1). Clearly,
then, on the Hopf surface with invariant Hermitian metrics, the properties of geometric-Dolbeault
formality, of geometric-Bott-Chern formality, of the Aeppli-harmonic forms having a structure of
algebra, of the Aeppli-hamornic forms having a structure of module over Bott-Chern-harmonic
forms, are all preserved along the Chern-Ricci flow.

We conclude that: any invariant Hermitian metric on an Inoue surface of type SM is
geometrically-Dolbeault formal, is geometrically-Bott-Chern formal, and the Aeppli-harmonic forms
have a structure of module over Bott-Chern-harmonic forms. On the other hand, Aeppli-harmonic
forms have a structure of algebra if and only if the metric is diagonal.
The Chern-Ricci flow has expression as in (3.3). Clearly, we can state that on an Inoue surface
of type SM with invariant Hermitian metrics, the properties of Dolbeault-geometric formality, of
Bott-Chern-geometric formality, of the Aeppli-harmonic forms having a structure of algebra, of
the Aeppli-hamornic forms having a structure of module over Bott-Chern-harmonic forms, are all

As for the harmonic representatives of Dolbeault, Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies, the
situation is exactly as (4.1).
We conclude that: any invariant Hermitian metric on an Inoue surface of type S ± is
geometrically-Dolbeault formal, is geometrically-Bott-Chern formal, and the Aeppli-harmonic forms
have a structure of module over Bott-Chern-harmonic forms. On the other hand, Aeppli-harmonic
forms have a structure of algebra if and only if the metric is diagonal.
The Chern-Ricci flow has expression as in (3.4). Hence, we have that on an Inoue surface
of type S ± with invariant Hermitian metrics, the properties of geometric-Dolbeault formality, of
geometric-Bott-Chern formality, of the Aeppli-harmonic forms having a structure of algebra, of
the Aeppli-hamornic forms having a structure of module over Bott-Chern-harmonic forms, are all
preserved along the Chern-Ricci flow.

We notice that for primary Kodaira surfaces an invariant Hermitian metric is never geometricallyDolbeault formal, e.g. ϕ1 ∧ ϕ̄1 is never Dolbeault-harmonic. In fact, Cattaneo and Tomassini
noticed in [CT15, Example 4.3] that primary Kodaira surfaces have a non-vanishing DolbeaultMassey triple product, whence they are not Dolbeault formal in the sense of [NT78]. Also, it is

never geometrically-Bott-Chern formal, e.g. ϕ1 ∧ ϕ1̄2̄ is never Bott-Chern-harmonic. The space of
Aeppli-harmonic forms is never an algebra, e.g. ϕ1 ∧ ϕ̄1 is never Aeppli-harmonic, neither a module
over the space of Bott-Chern harmonic forms, e.g. ϕ1 ∧ ϕ̄1 is never Aeppli-harmonic.
The primary Kodaira surface has trivial canonical bundle, therefore RicCh (ω) = 0. Then the
Chern-Ricci flow does not evolve invariant Hermitian metrics.
Then clearly on a primary Kodaira surface with invariant Hermitian metrics, the properties of
geometric-Dolbeault formality, of geometric-Bott-Chern formality, of the Aeppli-harmonic forms
having a structure of algebra, of the Aeppli-hamornic forms having a structure of module over
Bott-Chern-harmonic forms, are all preserved along the Chern-Ricci flow.
Secondary Kodaira surfaces. The cohomologies of secondary Kodaira surfaces can be explicitly
described [Tel06], see [ADT16, Theorem 4.1]:

We conclude that: any invariant Hermitian metric on a secondary Kodaira surface is geometricallyDolbeault formal, is geometrically-Bott-Chern formal, and the Aeppli-harmonic forms have a structure of module over Bott-Chern-harmonic forms. On the other hand, Aeppli-harmonic forms have
a structure of algebra if and only if the metric is diagonal.
The secondary Kodaira surface has torsion canonical bundle, therefore RicCh (ω) = 0. Then the
Chern-Ricci flow does not evolve invariant Hermitian metrics.
Then clearly on a secondary Kodaira surface with invariant Hermitian metrics, the properties
of geometric-Dolbeault formality, of geometric-Bott-Chern formality, of the Aeppli-harmonic forms
having a structure of algebra, of the Aeppli-hamornic forms having a structure of module over
Bott-Chern-harmonic forms, are all preserved along the Chern-Ricci flow.

Table 1. Summary of Theorem 3.1 and Propositions 3.2 and 4.1 concerning
geometric formalities (for Kotschick, Dolbeault, Bott-Chern) and the structure of
Aeppli-harmonic forms with respect to Hermitian metrics, respectively invariant
Hermitian metrics on Hopf, Inoue, Kodaira surfaces.

In view of further study, we notice that:
• in any mentioned cases, the Chern-Ricci flow starting at an invariant metric clearly preserves each one of the above properties, since it preserves diagonal metrics. (Compare also
[KT11, Proposition 3], showing that, for certain G-homogeneous spaces, every G-invariant
metrics is geometrically formal.) We ask whether this behaviour is more general, or whether
there exists a counterexample for which the Chern-Ricci flow does not preserve the geometric formality in the sense of Kotschick, or any other of the geometric Hermitian formalities
discussed above. We notice that the above invariant metrics are Gauduchon, that is pluriclosed (also known as SKT) being defined on four-dimensional manifolds. Therefore, as the
Referee kindly suggested to us, it may be interesting to further investigate the 6-dimensional
nilmanifolds admitting invariant SKT metrics as classified in [FPS04].
• Clearly, holomorphically-parallelizable manifolds do not provide such counterexamples when
restricting to invariant metrics, since they have holomorphically-trivial canonical bundle,
whence invariant Hermitian metrics are Chern-Ricci-flat. Our attempts on four-dimensional
Lie groups (possibly not admitting compact quotients), as in [Ova04] and references therein,
or small deformations of the Iwasawa manifold [Nak75, Ang13] still have not provided further
examples.
• The same question may be addressed for other geometric flows other than the Chern-Ricci
flow, for example the Hermitian curvature flows in [ST11] or in particular the one studied
in [Ust17].
• It could be interesting to further investigate Massey triple products and Dolbeault Massey
products, see [TTo14, CT15], or other Massey products, in particular on class VII surfaces
with b2 > 0 and on primary Kodaira surfaces.
