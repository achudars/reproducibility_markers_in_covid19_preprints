ABSTRACT

We present adaptive optics imaging from the NIRC2 instrument on the Keck-2 telescope that resolves the exoplanet host (and lens) star as it separates from the brighter
source star. These observations yield the K-band brightness of the lens and planetary
host star, as well as the lens-source relative proper motion, µrel,H . in the heliocentric
reference frame. The µrel,H measurement allows determination of the microlensing parallax vector, π E , which had only a single component determined by the microlensing
light curve. The combined measurements of µrel,H and KL provide the masses of the
host stat, Mhost = 0.426 ± 0.037M , and planet, mp = 3.27 ± 0.32MJupiter with a projected separation of 3.4 ± 0.5 AU. This confirms the tentative conclusion of a previous

–2–
paper (Dong et al. 2009b) that this super-Jupiter mass planet, OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb,
orbits an M-dwarf. Such planets are predicted to be rare by the core accretion theory
and have been difficult to find with other methods, but there are two two such planets with firm mass measurements from microlensing, and an additional 11 planetary
microlens events with host mass estimates < 0.5M and planet mass estimates > 2
Jupiter masses that could be confirmed by high angular follow-up observations. We
also point out that OGLE-2005-BLG-071L has separated far enough from its host star
that it should be possible to measure the host star metallicity with spectra from a high
angular resolution telescope such as Keck, the VLT, the Hubble Space Telescope or the
James Webb Space Telescope.

Introduction

The second exoplanet found by the microlensing method was OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb, but the
discovery paper did not do a detailed analysis of the higher order microlensing effects that could
constrain the masses and distance of the lens system (Udalski et al. 2005). A more detailed analysis
was done in a follow-up paper (Dong et al. 2009b) that included high angular resolution Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations. Unfortunately, the light curve had no significant signal for
finite source effects, the HST observations were taken too soon after the event to get a strong
measurement of the lens-source relative proper motion, µrel , and the light curve only constrains
one component of the two-dimensional microlensing parallax vector, π E . However, the light curve
measurements of π E , µrel , were marginally inconsistent with each other, and the lack of light curve
finite source effects prevented an additional estimate of the angular Einstein radius. Furthermore,
Dong et al. (2009b) pointed out that their estimates of the lens system masses and distance were
dependent on the assumption that the excess flux seen at the location of the source in the HST
images was due to the lens star, rather than a companion to the source. Nevertheless, with the
assumption that the excess flux was due to the lens and planetary host star, they conclude that
OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb may be the most massive planet known to orbit an M-dwarf at the time
of its publication in 2009.
In this paper, we use adaptive optics (AO) observations with the NIRC2 instrument on the
Keck-2 telescope to identify the lens and planetary host star and provide a precise measurement of
the masses and distance of the OGLE-2005-BLG-071L planetary system. These new results largely
confirm the more tentative conclusions of Dong et al. (2009b), except for the conclusion that the
lens system has thick disk kinematics.
Despite the decade between the publication of Dong et al. (2009b) and this paper, there are still

–3–
very few known massive planets in wide orbits around low-mass stars. NASA’s exoplanet archive1
lists only 19 planets with masses > 2MJupiter with semi-major between the snow line (taken to be
at 2.7(M/M ) AU) and 30 AU orbiting stars main sequence stars with 0.08M ≤ M ≤ 0.5M .
However, two of these are actually planets found by radial velocities with apparent typographical
errors in the host masses, so that the correct masses are above 0.5M . The only remaining planet
found by radial velocities in this category is GJ 317 b (Johnson et al. 2007), which has host
and planet masses of Mhost = 0.42 ± 0.05M and mp = 2.5+0.7
−0.4 MJupiter with a semi-major axis of
a = 1.15±0.05 AU, based on a combination of radial velocity and astrometric data (Anglada-Escudé
et al. 2012). This implies an overlap between the planet’s semi-major axis and our estimated snow
line position of dsnow = 2.7(M/M ) AU = 1.161 ± 0.135 AU (Kennedy & Kenyon 2008).
The remaining 16 of these wide orbit planets with super-Jupiter mass planets listed in the
NASA Exoplanet Archive have been found by microlensing. These may seem to challenge the core
accretion theory expectation that super-Jupiter mass planets should be rare in orbits around lowmass stars (Laughlin et al. 2004), but we must be careful to distinguish between planet and host
star mass measurements and Bayesian mass estimates based on the assumption that all stars are
equally likely to host a planet of the measured mass ratio, q. Recent AO image analysis for events
MOA-2007-BLG-400 (A. Bhattacharya et al., in preparation) and MOA-2012-BLG-220 (Vandorou
et al. 2019) has indicated host masses much larger than the previous Bayesian analyses suggested,
indicating that this prior assumption that all stars are equally likely to host gas giant planets may
be flawed. Therefore, it is important to focus on events with mass measurements.
The first microlens exoplanet with a confirmed planet mass of > 2MJupiter orbiting a lowmass star with 0.08M ≤ M ≤ 0.5M was OGLE-2012-BLG-0406 (Poleski et al. 2014), which
has host and planet masses of Mhost = 0.44 ± 0.07M and mp = 2.73 ± 0.43MJupiter according to
a detailed analysis by Tsapras et al. (2014). In this paper, we present the second such microlens
planet, OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb with host and planet masses of Mhost = 0.431±0.034M and mp =
3.37±0.30MJupiter at a projected separation of 3.4±0.5 AU. However, event OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb
is included in the combined statistical sample of Suzuki et al. (2016), which means that it can readily
be included in a statistical analysis of planet properties. In fact, there are three other events from the
Suzuki et al. (2016) sample that should allow host and planet mass measurements from high angular
resolution follow-up observations. These are OGLE-2008-BLG-355 (Koshimoto et al. 2014), MOA2009-BLG-387 (Batista et al. 2011) and MOA-2011-BLG-322Lb (Shvartzvald et al. 2014), while
such measurements for MOA-2012-BLG-006 (Poleski et al. 2017) in the Suzuki et al. (2016) sample
would be quite difficult, because of its bright giant source star. In addition to these events in the
Suzuki et al. (2016) sample, the following events are candidates for super-Jupiter planets orbiting
low-mass (< 0.5M ) stars: MOA-2010-BLG-73, OGLE-2013-BLG-0102, OGLE-2013-BLG-1761,
OGLE-2015-BLG-0954, MOA-2016-BLG-227, OGLE-2016-BLG-0263, KMT-2016-BLG-1397, and
KMT-2017-BLG-1038 (Street et al. 2013; Jung et al. 2015; Hirao et al. 2017; Shin et al. 2016;
Bennett et al. 2017; Koshimoto et al. 2017b; Zang et al. 2018; Shin et al. 2019). Perhaps the most

interesting candidate is OGLE-2018-BLG-1011 (Han et al. 2019), which has two super-Jupiter
planets with mass ratios of 0.015 and 0.0095 orbiting a star with an estimated mass of ∼ 0.2M .
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the Keck high angular resolution
follow-up observations and their analysis, and in Section 3, we discuss the measured lens-source
relative proper motion and how it can be used to constrain the microlensing parallax and angular
Einstein radius. Our preliminary light curve modeling is presented in Section 4. In Section 5, we
explain how we constrain the light curve modeling in order to sample the light curves that are
consistent with the data, and then we present the lens system masses, separation and distance that
are implied by the combined light curve and Keck follow-up data in Section 6. Finally, we discuss
the implications of these results and present our conclusions in Section 7.

Keck Follow up Observations and Analysis

We observed the source and lens stars for microlensing event OGLE-2005-BLG-071 with the
NIRC2 instrument on the Keck-2 telescope on May 28, 2019 as a part of our NASA Keck Key
Strategic Mission Support program entitled “Development of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Exoplanet Mass Measurement Method”. The observations were carried out using
both the NIRC2 wide and narrow cameras, which employ 1024 × 1024 pixels with image scales of
39.686 mas/pixel and 9.942 mas/pixel, respectively. All Keck images were taken using the Keck-2
laser guide star AO system. The wide images are used for photometric calibrations, and we used
a co-add of 8 of 10 dithered, wide camera images in the KS passband to calibrate to reprocessed
images from the VVV survey (Minniti et al. 2010), which is calibrated to 2MASS (Carpenter 2001)
following Beaulieu et al. (2018). (Two of these wide camera images were not used due to relatively
poor image quality.) These wide camera images were flat field and dark current corrected using
standard methods. We use Scamp (Bertin 2010a) to perform astrometry on the individual frames.
We then did a median stacking using the SWarp package (Bertin et al. 2002; Bertin 2010b).
The details of our methods are described in Batista et al. (2014). We performed aperture
photometry on these wide camera images using the latest version of the SExtractor code (Bertin
& Arnouts 1996). These wide images were used to detect and match as many bright isolated stars
as possible to our custom reduction (Beaulieu et al. 2016) of the calibrated VVV images. Once the
wide camera images were calibrated, we calibrated the narrow camera images to the wide camera
images. This procedure provided an overall calibration precision for the co-added narrow camera
image based on nominal uncertainties of 0.06 magnitudes. SExtractor, Scamp and SWarp are
distributed by astromatic.net (Bertin et al. 2012).
We took 40 dithered NIRC2 narrow camera were taken on the same night as the wide camera
images, and the 23 best images were combined to make the image shown in Figures 1(a) and (b)
after correcting for achromatic differential refraction (Yelda et al. 2010) and geometric distortion
(Service et al. 2016). Chromatic differential refraction is negligible compared to our measurement

–6–
uncertainties (Gubler & Tytler 1998), so we ignore it. The point spread function (PSF) full-width,
half-max (FWHM) of this image is ≈ 65 mas. Because the source and candidate lens stars are
separated by ∼ 1 FWHM, we must analyze the Keck data with a PSF fitting code to measure
the astrometry and photometry of this 2-star system. Following Bhattacharya et al. (2018), we
use DAOPHOT (Stetson 1987) for this analysis, which has a proven ability to handle peculiar PSF
shapes that are sometimes encountered in AO images (Bennett et al. 2010b). The initial DAOPHOT
reduction did not detect the fainter component of the source plus lens star blend because it does
not try to find stars at such small separations. This resulted in the residual image shown in
Figure 1(c) when the best fit PSF model was subtracted from the the original image (shown in
Figures 1(a) and (b)). Following Bhattacharya et al. (2018), we then added an additional source at
the position of the brightest residual in Figure 1(c) and reran DAOPHOT. This resulted in the two
stars indicated in Figure 1(b) and the two-star fit residual shown in Figure 1(d). This two-star fit
residual is nearly featureless, indicating that the Keck image is well modeled by two stars separated
by ∼ 1 FWHM. This analysis reveals that the magnitudes of the two stars are KS = 17.679 ± 0.060
and KL = 18.925 ± 0.062, where the uncertainty is dominated by the calibration uncertainty.
The identification of the brighter star as the source star is determined from the predicted K-band
brightness of the source star.
In order to determine which star is the source and which is the candidate lens star, we need
to compare to the light curve predictions. The Dong et al. (2009b) paper gives magnitudes and
colors based on an early version of the OGLE-III survey calibrations and uses old values for the
intrinsic color and magnitude of red clump giant stars to estimate the extinction. We redo this
analysis with updated OGLE-III light curves, with the final instrumental magnitudes, the final
OGLE-III magnitude and color calibrations (Szymański et al. 2011) and the Nataf et al. (2013)
values for the properties of the bulge red clump giant stars at the Galactic position (l = −4.4198◦ ,
b = −3.7864◦ ) of the target. Using standard methods (Bennett et al. 2010b), we find the centroid
of the red clump for stars within 20 of the source to be [(V − I)rcg , Ircg ] = [1.85, 15.71]. Based on the
intrinsic red clump giant stars from Nataf et al. (2013), this gives a color excess of E(V − I) = 0.79
and I-band extinction of AI = 1.10, which together imply V -band extinction of AV = 1.89.
The K-band extinction was determined to be AK = 0.15 ± 0.05 from the online VVV extinction
calculator (Gonzalez et al. 2011) using the Nishiyama et al. (2009) extinction law. From the best
fit constrained light curve model, described in Section 5, we find a source color of VS − IS = 1.43,
so the extinction corrected color is VS0 − IS0 = 0.64. Using the color-color relations of Kenyon &
Hartmann (1995) and the I-band magnitude, IS = 19.54 from this same model, we predict a source
magnitude of KS = 17.89. This can only be consistent with the brighter of the two blended stars
shown in Figures 1(a) and (b). The fit source brightness is fainter than the this brighter star by
about 3-σ, which suggests that the source might have a faint companion.

The Lens-Source Relative Proper Motion

The measured offset of the lens star with respect to the source is ∆RA = −41.5 ± 1.3 mas and
∆DEC = 36.1 ± 1.3 mas. The Keck observations were taken on 28 May 2019, which was 14.103
years after the event. The apparent motion relative motion of the lens and source is primarily due
to their space motions, but there is also a contribution from parallax due to the orbital motion
< 0.2 mas for a lens more distant that D > 2 kpc.
of the Earth. However, this contribution is ∼
L ∼
We can ignore this contribution, because it is much smaller than the error bars on our position
measurements, so the lens-source relative proper motion is
µrel,H = (µrel,H,E , µrel,H,N ) = (−2.945 ± 0.091, 2.563 ± 0.091) mas/yr ,

(1)

where the subscript H indicates that this is the proper motion in the Heliocentric reference frame,
while the E and N subscripts indicate the East and North directions. We can also convert these
relative proper motions to Galactic coordinates:
µrel,H = (µrel,H,l , µrel,H,b ) = (0.703 ± 0.091, 3.840 ± 0.091) mas/yr .

The uncertainties in the separation measurements were calculated following King (1983), using the

where F is the flux of the star with the measured position.

3.1.

Source and Lens Proper Motion

In addition to the lens-source relative proper motion, we can also compare the astrometry of
our 2019 Keck images to the astrometry of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images taken in 2005
and 2006 (Dong et al. 2009b). We select the 2005 V -band (F555W) images taken 14.013 years
before the Keck images because these will provide a negligible parallax signal while providing a
precise position for source star, since the the lens-source separation is quite small one month after
the event peak, and the source was still magnified by a factor of ∼ 2 and is much brighter than
the lens in the V -band. The HST data was reduced with DOLPHOT (Dolphin 2000) which does
not produce astrometry with precision that is quite as high as the method of Anderson & King
(2000, 2004, 2006), but this will have little influence on the final proper motion results, because
the uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainties in the Gaia astrometry.
There are three relatively bright stars within 500 of the OGLE-2005-BLG-071 microlensing
event with proper motion measurements in the Gaia DR2 data release (Gaia Collaboration et
al. 2018a). These stars have Gaia numbers 4041487538966873216, 4041487538966873344, and
4041487538966886016, and all three of these events have reliable proper motion measurements
as evidenced by their renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) values of < 1.3 (Lindegren 2018).

–8–
Their V -band magnitudes are 18.399, 18.238, and 16.953, respectively. This allows us to determine
the source proper motions in Galactic coordinates:
µS = (µS,l , µS,b ) = (−4.99 ± 0.19, −0.69 ± 0.25) mas/yr .

(4)

We can then add µS and µrel,H from equation 2 to determine the lens proper motion,
µL = (µL,l , µL,b ) = (−3.14 ± 0.21, 3.38 ± 0.27) mas/yr .

(5)

The source proper motion, µS , is dominated by the reflex motion of Galactic rotation and is
quite typical for the proper motion of Galactic bulge star. Dong et al. (2009b) claimed that the
OGLE-2005-BLG-071L lens star had the kinematics of a thick disk star. If true, this would be a
surprise because super-Jupiter mass planets are thought to form preferentially around more massive,
high metallicity stars. Thick disk stars tend to have low metallicity, so it would be surprising if
OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb was a super-Jupiter mass planet orbiting a a low-mass, low metallicity
star. The Dong et al. (2009b) claim of thick disk kinematics is based upon their claim of velocity
with respect to the local standard of rest of vLSR = 103 ± 15 km/sec. We can compare this to our
measurement of the lens star transverse velocity if we assume a lens distance DL = 3.5 kpc, which
is the favored DL according to the analysis presented below in Section 6. We find a transverse
velocity of vL = (vL,ll , vL,b ) = (−52.5, 56.5) km/sec for a total transverse velocity of 77 km/sec.
This is within 2-σ of the Dong et al. (2009b) vLSR , but in fact, Dong et al. (2009b) do not specify
that their vLSR value refers to a transverse velocity, so it is probably supposed to be a full threedimensional velocity, with the unmeasured radial component just an estimate from averaging over
a Galactic model. This would imply that their vLSR value is probably consistent with our measured
77 km/sec transverse velocity. However, their conclusion that the OGLE-2005-BLG-071L has thick
disk kinematics does not follow.
The Gaia DR2 data release enables a much more accurate test of the kinematic properties
for stars that are a few kpc from the Sun. In particular, the Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018b)
study of the Milky Way disk kinematics provides valuable information on the kinematic properties
of stars in the vicinity of OGLE-2005-BLG-071L., located at a distance of DL ∼ 3.5 kpc toward
the Galactic bulge at ∼ 0.22 kpc below the Galactic plane. Figure 11 of Gaia Collaboration et
al. (2018b) indicates that the median orbital velocity in the disk has dropped to vφ = 205 km/sec
compared to vφ = 240 km/sec at the Solar circle. This means that the velocity of OGLE-2005BLG-071L compared to the stars in its vicinity vL,VSR = (−17.5, 56.5) km/sec (where VSR stands
for vicinity standard of rest). The median stellar velocity in the z direction (perpendicular to the
Galactic disk) doesn’t differ from the median velocity of 0 at the Solar circle, but the velocity
dispersions in both directions grow to σvφ = 45 km/sec and σvz = 38 km/sec. Thus, the l and b
components of vL are 0.4-σ and 1.5-σ from the center of the velocity distribution. So, we conclude
that OGLE-2005-BLG-071L has normal stellar kinematics for a star at its location, and it should
not be considered to be a thick disk star.

3.2.

Geocentric Relative Proper Motion

Our light curve modeling is done in a geocentric reference frame that differs from the heliocentric frame by the instantaneous velocity of the Earth at the time of peak magnification. This
avoids large corrected uncertainties for the light curve parameters that would be quite common
for models done in the heliocentric frame. However, this also means that the lens-source relative
proper motion that we measure with follow-up observations is not in the same reference frame as
the light curve parameters. This is an important issue because, as we show below, the measured
relative proper motion can be combined with the microlensing parallax light curve parameter to
determine the mass of the lens system. The relation between the relative proper motions in the
heliocentric and geocentric coordinate systems are given by (Dong et al. 2009b):
µrel,H = µrel,G +

v⊕ πrel
,
AU

(6)

where v⊕ is the projected velocity of the earth relative to the sun (perpendicular to the line-ofsight) at the time of peak magnification. The projected velocity for OGLE-2005-BLG-071 is v⊕ E,N
= (15.508, 4.685) km/sec = (3.271, 0.988) AU/yr at the peak of the microlensing light curve,
HJD’= 3480.70. The relative parallax is defined as πrel ≡ 1/DL − 1/DS , where DL and DS are lens
and source distances, so equation 6 can be written as:
µrel,G = µrel,H − (3.271, 0.988) × (1/DL − 1/DS ) ,
which is a more convenient form since µrel,H has been measured directly from the Keck images.
Now at each possible lens distance, we can use the µrel,G value from equation 6 to determine the
angular Einstein radius, θE = µrel,G tE . As we explain below, the µrel,G can also be used to convert
a one-dimensional microlensing parallax measurement into a full measurement of the microlensing
parallax vector. The lens flux and µrel,H measurements from the Keck observations and the 1-D
parallax measurement constrain the angular Einstein radius, the microlensing parallax vector and,
therefore, the mass and distance of the lens.

4.

Light Curve Model

Dong et al. (2009b) present a detailed discussion of light curve models for OGLE-2005-BLG071, and we have little to add to this discussion. However, we find it necessary to do our own
modeling of this event in order to apply the constraints from our Keck observations in a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. We use the same data set as Dong et al. (2009b) with
some minor modifications. First, we drop the Palomar data set because it covers only 80 minutes
when the magnification changes by less than 5%. Because the source and background fluxes are fit
independently for each data set (Rhie et al. 1999), the Palomar data do not provide a significant
constraint on the light curve model. As is common practice (Dong et al. 2009b), once we have
established all the possible degenerate solutions, we renormalize the χ2 per degree of freedom to

– 10 –
be χ2 /d.o.f. ' 1 in order to obtain more reasonable error bars on the inferred parameters of the
lens system.
Table 1 shows the parameters of our four degenerate light curve models and the Markov Chain
average of all four models. The parameters that apply to single lens models are the Einstein
radius crossing time, tE , the time of closest alignment between the source and the lens system
center-of-mass, t0 , and the distance of closest approach between the source and the lens system
center-of-mass, u0 , which is given in units of the Einstein radius. The addition of a second lens mass
requires three additional parameters, the mass ratio of the two lens masses, q, their separation, s,
in units of the Einstein radius, and angle, α, between the source trajectory and the transverse
line that passes through the two lens masses. In addition, a large fraction of binary lens systems
exhibit finite source effects that can be modeled with the addition of the source radius crossing
time parameter, t∗ . For high magnification events, like OGLE-2005-BLG-071, the transformation
s → 1/s often has only a slight change on the shape of the light curve. This is known as the
close-wide degeneracy, and it applies to OGLE-2005-BLG-071 (Udalski et al. 2005; Dong et al.
2009b).
Many longer duration binary lens events, like OGLE-2005-BLG-071, exhibit light curve effects
due to the orbital motion of the Earth during the event. This is known as the microlensing parallax
effect, and Dong et al. (2009b) have shown that OGLE-2005-BLG-071 has a significant signal, which
is described by a two-dimensional vector, π E , that is parallel to the direction of lens-source relative
motion. The inclusion of the microlensing parallax parameters introduces an addition degeneracy.
Without microlensing parallax, the transformation u0 → −u0 , α → −α produces exactly the same

light curve, and it can just be thought of as a change of parameters. When microlensing parallax
is added, however, this transformation amounts to a reflection of the lens system orientation with
respect to the orbit of the Earth, so it is no longer a trivial, exact degeneracy (unless the lens system
lies in the ecliptic plane). This second degeneracy is often referred to as the u0 ↔ −u0 degeneracy.
We do not include lens orbital motion for these unconstrained models, which we consider only to
offer a comparison to the models with models with the constraints from high angular resolution
follow-up observations.
There is one fixed parameter not included in Table 1. The geocentric coordinate system
used to define the microlensing parallax parameters is fixed to the Earth’s orbital velocity at
tfix = 3480.7 These unconstrained models have 1298 observations, 9 non-linear parameters, and 18
linear parameters for a total of 1271 degrees of freedom.

Relative Proper Motion Constraints on πE and Light Curve Models

As Figure 2 indicates, the microlensing light curve provides a fairly tight constraint on one
component of the microlensing parallax vector, π E . This is the component in the direction of the
Earth’s acceleration, which is nearly parallel to the East-West direction. But as it is often the case
(Muraki et al. 2011), only the πE,E component of the microlensing parallax vector is measured
precisely. As shown in the left panel of Figure 2, the 2-σ range for πE,N is −0.39 < πE,N < 0.43.
However, the microlensing parallax vector, πE is parallel to the µrel,G vector, and the two quantities
are related by
πrel µrel,G
πE =
,
(7)
tE |µrel,G |2
so with measurements of πE,E and µrel,H , we can use equations 6 and 7 to solve for πE,N (Gould et
al. 1994; Ghosh et al. 2004; Bennett et al. 2007). While this leads to a quadratic equation (Gould
2014), only one of these solutions has a positive lens distance, DL . Bhattacharya et al. (2018)
have argued that the odds of an ambiguity due the two solutions of this quadratic equation are
negligible, because even is cases where both solutions have positive DL , they predict very different
lens magnitudes.
The volume of the light curve model parameter space that is allowed by the Keck observation
constraints on µrel,H and KL is very much smaller than the volume allowed without those constraints
as Figure 2 indicates. As a result, we would have poor sampling of the posterior distributions if
we were to apply these constraints to Markov Chains. So, following Bhattacharya et al. (2018)
we implement constraints on µrel,H and KL during the light curve modeling. The relative proper
motion, µrel,H , is constrained by the measurement given in equation 1, and we constrain the lens star
K-band brightness to be KL = 18.925 ± 0.062, as discussed in Section 2. Following Bhattacharya et
al. (2018), these constraints implement a χ2 contribution from each of the constraints and adding
it to the light curve fit χ2 inside the modeling code (Bennett 2010). We use the empirical massluminosity relation described by Bennett et al. (2018b), which is a combination of several different

follow-up observations. Right panel: The πE distribution resulting from the addition of the high
resolution follow-up imaging constraints. The following color scheme is used to denote the χ2
differences from the best fit light curve model: black represents ∆χ2 < 1, red represents ∆χ2 < 4,
green represents ∆χ2 < 16, cyan represents ∆χ2 < 25, and magenta represents ∆χ2 ≥ 25. (The
weighting of the models does not depend on the ∆χ2 values, however.) The right panel shows that
the Keck relative proper motion measurements constrain the North component of πE (πE,N ), which
was largely unconstrained by the light curve. Without the µrel,H measurement, in the left panel,
the light curve slightly favors solutions with πE,N < 0, but the constraint forces πE,N > 0. Note
that this figure combines both the degenerate u0 > 0 and u0 < 0 models.

– 13 –
mass-luminosity relations for different mass ranges. For ML ≥ 0.66 M , 0.54 M ≥ ML ≥ 0.12 M ,
and 0.10 M ≥ ML ≥ 0.07 M , we use the relations of Henry & McCarthy (1993), Delfosse et al.
(2000), and Henry et al. (1999), respectively. In between these mass ranges, we linearly interpolate
between the two relations used on the boundaries. That is, we interpolate between the Henry &
McCarthy (1993) and the Delfosse et al. (2000) relations for 0.66 M > ML > 0.54 M , and we
interpolate between the Delfosse et al. (2000) and Henry et al. (1999) relations for 0.12 M > ML >
0.10 M .
For the mass-luminosity relations, we must also consider the foreground extinction. At a
Galactic latitude of b = −3.7865◦ , and a lens distance of ∼ 2 kpc, the lens system is likely to be
behind some, but not all, of the dust that is in the foreground of the source. We assume a dust
scale height of hdust = 0.10 ± 0.02 kpc, so that the extinction in the foreground of the lens is given
by
1 − e−|DL (sin b)/hdust |
Ai,L =
Ai,S ,
(8)
1 − e−|DS (sin b)/hdust |
where the index i refers to the passband: I, V , or K. In the Markov Chain calculations themselves,
we fix DS = 8.8 kpc for our source star at a Galactic longitude of l = −4.4198◦ , and we fix the dust
scale height at hdust = 0.10 kpc. (The distance to Galactic bar at this longitude is 8.8 kpc (Nataf et
al. 2013).) But, we remove this distance restriction by reweighting the links in the Markov Chain
when we sum them for our final results as discussed in Section 6.
In addition to these constraints, we also include two additional parameters to describe the
orbital motion of the planet. Unlike the case of the two planet event OGLE-2006-BLG-109 (Gaudi
et al. 2008; Bennett et al. 2010b), the light curve does not provide significant constraints on the
planetary orbital motion, although we fix the orbital period at 5000 days to avoid the possibility
of an unphysical future encounter between the source and lens system that might occur if we
assumed constant velocities. The two orbital motion parameters are ṡx and ṡy , which are the
orbital motion in the direction of star-planet separation (at t = tfix ) and the perpendicular direction,
respectively. As in the case of MOA-2009-BLG-266 (Muraki et al. 2011), the inclusion of orbital
motion does affect the relative weighting of the degenerate models. In particular, the inclusion of
orbital motion substantially decreases the χ2 difference between the wide and close models, which
are only disfavored by ∆χ2 ≈ 4.3 for the constrained models. This can be seen by a comparison of
the χ2 difference between the wide and close models for the constrained model, shown in Table 2
and the unconstrained models without orbital motion, shown in Table 1. As was the case with
MOA-2009-BLG-266, the χ2 difference between the u0 > 0 and u0 < 0 solutions is also decreased.
The best fit constrained light curve is shown in Figure 3. Despite the two additional light curve
parameters, the model constraints on the relative proper motion and lens magnitude increase the
number of degrees of freedom to 1272 or 1274, depending on whether the upper limits on the
combined lens plus source V and I magnitudes are counted as full constraints.
While these constraints have little effect on the best fit model χ2 , they have a dramatic effect
on the allowed range of microlensing parallax parameters, as Figure 2 indicates. The 2-σ range for

πE,N is reduced from −1.07 < πE,N < 0.49 to 0.104 < πE,N < 0.144, which is a reduction of a

which will be used in Section 6 to determine the lens mass.
The orbital motion parameters in these models are constrained to be ensure consistency with
a bound orbit, using the method presented by Muraki et al. (2011). The last column of Table 2
provides the mean and RMS of each of the model parameters, and distributions of these parameters

Lens Properties

The situation for OGLE-2005-BLG-071 is similar to the case of OGLE-2012-BLG-0950 (Bhattacharya et al. 2018) in that the source radius crossing time, t∗ , has not been reliably measured.
Fortunately, as discussed above in Section 3.2, it is straight forward to constrain the angular Einstein radius, θE , with our measurement of µrel,H given in equations 1 and 2. The conversion between
the heliocentric and geocentric frames only provides a minor complication. This simplest if we assume that the source distance, DS , is known. In this case, we can determine πE and µrel,G from
the measurement of µrel,H and light curve model parameters using equations 6 and 7. We can then
determine the angular Einstein radius from θE = tE µrel,G .
Measurements of either angular Einstein radius, θE , or the microlensing parallax amplitude,
πE , provide mass-distance relations (Bennett 2008; Gaudi 2012),

but it does depend on DS . Our measurement of the host star K-band magnitude, KL , also implies
a mass-distance relation when combined with our empirical mass-luminosity relation, and the HST
observation in 2005 and 2006 (Dong et al. 2009b) provide upper limits on the host star brightness
in the I and V bands. As a result, this system is overconstrained with mass measurements from
equation 10 and the combination of equation 11 and the K-band mass-luminosity relation. In our
MCMC light curve models, we have fixed DS , and applied χ2 constraints based on the measured
µrel,H and K-band values and the IL and VL upper limits.
We follow a somewhat similar procedure in our constrained light curve modeling. We include
both components of π E and t∗ as model parameters even though the light curve data provide

very weak constraints on πE,N and t∗ . With the πE and t∗ values from each light curve model,
we can determine θE and then ML from equation 10. With DS fixed, we use equation 11 to
determine DL . This provides all the information that we need to determine KL , IL , and VL from
the mass-luminosity relations and equation 8 and µrel,G from equation 6. We then calculate addition
contributions to χ2 for each of these five measured parameters (two components of µrel,H and three
2
2
magnitudes). These χ2 contributions have the form ∆χ2 = e−(ymodel −ymeas ) /2σy where ymeas and σy
measured value and uncertainty, while ymodel is the model value. The magnitudes are converted to
linear fluxes before the constraints are applied, and the V and I constraints are only applied if the
model flux is larger than the measured values.
For our final results, we combine the parallel Markov chains for our light curve models, but we
reweight each of the models to remove the fixed distance constraint. We multiply by the inverse of
the weighting with the fixed source distance applied in the light curve model, and then we select a
new DS value from the probability distribution from the Galactic model from Bennett et al. (2014).
Figure 4 and Table 3 provide the results of our analysis. We find that the host star has a mass
of Mhost = 0.43 ± 0.04M and it is orbited by a super-Jupiter mass planet with mp = 3.3 ± 0.3MJup
at a projected separation of a⊥ = 3.4 ± 0.5 AU. This translates to a three-dimensional separation of
+2.3
AU under the assumption of a random orientation of the planetary orbit, and the lens
a3d = 4.0−0.6
system is located at a distance of DL = 3.5 ± 0.3 kpc. These distributions are indicated by the red
histograms in Figure 4. These results are a dramatic improvement in precision over blue histograms
that indicate the parameters predicted by our Bayesian analysis without any constraints from
Keck or HST observations. However, the lens distance distribution predicted by the unconstrained
analysis is peculiar with its sharp peak at very small distances. This is due to the slight light curve
preference for very small source radius crossing time, t∗ , values. We suspect that this is due to
systematic errors in the Auckland Observatory photometry that our overcome by the much stronger
constraints on µrel,H and KL from the Keck images. As discussed by Dong et al. (2009b), the flat

field images from this telescope had serious scattered light problems that were exacerbated by a 180◦
flip of the telescope orientation in the middle of each night. Also, the observations were unfiltered,
which led to photometry errors as large as 7% due to differential atmospheric chromatic extinction.
It is possible that some of these systematic errors remain after Dong et al. (2009b) attempts to
correct them. For example, their correction for differential chromatic extinction implicitly assumed
that the atmospheric chromatic extinction effects remained constant over all four days when the
event was at its peak, but the water vapor and aerosol composition of the atmosphere might have
changed during that period. This problem was mitigated in the Dong et al. (2009b) analysis by the
constraints they placed on the lens brightness and a crude constraint they placed on the lens-source
relative proper motion from the color-dependent centroid shift effect (Bennett et al. 2006).

6.1.

Comparison to Previous Analysis

Our conclusions are largely in line with those of Dong et al. (2009b), except that we do not
have to make the assumption that the unlensed light coincident with the source in the 2005 and
2006 HST images is not due to a source companion. While our Keck data are consistent with the
existence of a faint source companion, our measurement of the K-band lens brightness indicates
excess I and V -band flux seen in the HST images is primarily due to the lens star.
The one Dong et al. (2009b) claim that clearly seems to be incorrect is the claim that the
OGLE-2005-BLG-071L planetary host star has thick disk kinematics. Dong et al. (2009b) do not
provide many details about how they reach this conclusion, but a primary difference appears to be
the fact that they compare their estimated lens velocity to the local standard of rest rather than
the kinematics of the Galaxy at location of the lens, which was not well understood in 2009 (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2018b).
It is also of interest to consider the accuracy of their measurement of the color dependent
centroid shift measurement (Bennett et al. 2006), since this is of interest for WFIRST (Bhattacharya
et al. 2018). Dong et al. (2009b) measure offsets between the target (source plus lens blend) centroid
in the I and V -band magnitudes of ∆rI−V,E = −0.52 ± 0.20 mas and ∆rI−V,N = 0.22 ± 0.20 mas
in the East and North directions, respectively. However, this includes both proper motion and
parallax, so to compare to our measurements, we must convert this measurement to the heliocentric
reference frame. With our estimate of the lens system distance, DL , the centroid shift becomes
∆rI−V,E,H = −0.45 ± 0.20 mas and ∆rI−V,N,H = 0.22 ± 0.20 mas. We can compare this to the value
determined from our precise Keck µrel,H measurements. We find ∆rI−V,E,H = −0.115 ± 0.003 mas
and ∆rI−V,N,H = 0.100±0.003 mas, so the HST estimates are off by 1.7σ to the East and 0.5σ to the
North. This implies that the Dong et al. (2009b) error bars are consistent with our measurement
and that they are not likely to be underestimated by as much as a factor of 2.

Discussion and Conclusions

Our Keck AO follow-up observations have identified the OGLE-2005-BLG-071L planetary host
star through measurements of the lens K-band magnitude, and the lens-source relative proper motion, µrel,H . These measurements allow the determination of the lens mass and distance through
multiple, redundant constraints. The µrel,H measurement can be combined with the partial microlensing parallax measurement from the microlensing light curve to yield the lens system masses,
and the µrel,H measurement can also be combined with the lens K-band magnitude to yield the lens
mass and distance, as well. These determinations are consistent with each other, and we combine
them to give host and planet masses of Mhost = 0.426 ± 0.037M , and mp = 3.27 ± 0.32MJup , with
a projected separation of a⊥ = 3.38 ± 0.52 AU at a distance of DL = 3.46 ± 0.33 kpc. The excess
flux seen in 2005 and 2006 HST observations is also consistent with these conclusions.
This confirms that tentative conclusion of Dong et al. (2009b) that this event is a somewhat
unexpected sample of a super-Jupiter mass planet orbiting an M-dwarf. Such planetary systems
are thought to be rare (Laughlin et al. 2004). Since the wide model is slightly favored, the preferred
orbital period is 12 years or more, and this means that many exoplanet Doppler radial velocity
surveys do not monitor their stars long enough to detect such planets. However, those surveys that
do monitor the radial velocity of low-mass stars for long periods of time claim a low frequency of such
planets (Johnson et al. 2010), although they have have not yet done a complete statistical analysis.
The microlensing statistical analysis of Suzuki et al. (2016, 2018) seems quite consistent with the
preliminary radial velocity results since it includes two planets with mass ratios of q ∼ 7 × 10−3 ,
when we would expect ∼ 700 if there was an average of one such planet orbiting every star. So, we
might expect an occurrence rate for such planets of 1/300 or 1/400. The other similar planet in
the Suzuki et al. (2016) sample is MOA-2008-BLG-379 (Suzuki et al. 2014,e).
It is expected that the occurrence rate for super-Jupiter planets should be higher for planets
that orbit high metallicity host stars (Fischer, & Valenti 2005). Because the host star, OGLE-2005BLG-071L, can now be resolved from the source star in K-band AO images, it should now be possible to determine the host star metallicity with moderate resolution K-band spectra (Rojas-Ayala
et al. 2010) using instruments such as Keck/OSIRIS and VLT/MUSE. Both of these instruments
employ AO feeds and OH suppression that are probably required for spectra of sufficient S/N to
measure metallicity.
Finally, we should mention that this event is part of our Keck Key Strategic Mission Support
(KSMS) program that aims to determine masses and distances for the vast majority of stars in the
(Suzuki et al. 2016) sample, as well as the MOA 9-year microlensing event sample that is now under
analysis. One important aspect of this program is that it can test an assumption that is currently
used to to estimate the host mass for most of the planets found by microlensing (Beaulieu et al.
2006; Dong et al. 2009a). For this event, a sub-Saturn mass planet (Bhattacharya et al. 2018),
and a Uranus-mass planet (Bennett et al. 2015; Batista et al. 2015), we find that the measured
host star mass is close to the Bayesian prediction, which relies upon the assumption that stars of

– 21 –
any mass are equally likely to host the planet with the given mass ratio. This differs from the
case of two other targets from our KSMS program: MOA-2007-BLG-400 (Bhattacharya et al., in
preparation) and MOA-2013-BLG-220 (Vandorou et al. 2019). The mass measurement for these
two events find masses that are at the 94th and 93rd percentile Bayesian analysis prediction based
on the equal planet hosting probability assumption. These events also have very similar mass
ratios of q = 2.2 × 10−3 and q = 3.3 × 10−3 . This suggests that high mass stars may be much
more likely to host planets beyond the snow line with mass ratios in the 0.002 < q < 0.0035 range,
but our OGLE-2005-BLG-071 result suggests that this trend may not hold at higher mass ratios.
Clearly, more mass microlens exoplanet host star mass measurements are needed to confirm such
speculation.
