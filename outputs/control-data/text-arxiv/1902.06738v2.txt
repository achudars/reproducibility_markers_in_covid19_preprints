polarization of gauge bosons can be naturally identified as mixture of the goldstone component and a remnant gauge component that vanishes at the limit of zero mass, making the
goldstone equivalence manifest. In light of this observation, we re-examine the Feynman
rules of massive gauge theory by treating gauge fields and their corresponding goldstone
fields as single objects, writing them uniformly as 5-component “vector” fields. The gauge
group is taken to be SU (2)L to preserve custodial symmetry. We find the derivation of
gauge-goldstone propagators becomes rather trivial by noticing there is a remarkable parallel between massless gauge theory and massive gauge theory in this notation. We also
derive the Feynman rules of all vertices, finding the vertex for self-interactions of vector
(gauge-goldstone) bosons are especially simplified. We then demonstrate that the new form
of the longitudinal polarization vector and the standard form give the same results for all the
3-point on-shell amplitudes. This on-shell matching confirms similar results obtained with
on-shell approach for massive scattering amplitudes by Arkani-Hamed et.al. in ref.([23]).
Finally we calculate some 1 → 2 collinear splitting amplitudes by making use of the new
Feynman rules and the on-shell match condition.

INTRODUCTION

In a massive gauge theory with Higgs mechanism, scattering amplitudes involving longitudinal
polarizations have the famous problem of power counting[1–3]: while single Feynman diagrams
increase with energy, the S-matrix is well-behaved when taking into account the contribution of
the Higgs boson. This failure of power counting causes many complications and confusion both
practically and conceptually. The origin of the problem is the longitudinal polarization vector
behave as ǫµL ∼

kµ
mW

+O( mEW ) in high energy limit. Another way to phrase it is that the longitudinal

polarization vector and Feynman diagrams don’t have a smooth limit as mW → 0, thus it’s not clear
how the theory approaches massless limit continuously. In future high energy colliders [4][5], we
will approach energy scales in which the EW symmetry will be effectively restored. This problem
becomes even more severe.
Practically this problem is often solved by replacing the longitudinal vector bosons with the corresponding goldstone bosons, according to the so-called goldstone equivalence theorem(GET)[11–
15], which states that scattering amplitudes involving longitudinal vector bosons can be approximated by the corresponding goldstone modes in high energy limit:

mW
M(WL , WL , WL , ...., WL ) = (−i)n M(φ, φ, φ, ...., φ) + O( √ ),
s

with

(1)

√
s being the hard scale of the process. However, this solution is still not completely sat-

isfactory, as GET is only an approximation with other terms suppressed in high energy limit.
Although the approximation seems to work for naive power counting, it’s not utterly clear if the
contributions of the terms neglected by GET are real subdominant. In fact, it was discovered in
[6] that there is a new class of splitting functions contributing to DGLAP evolution of EW PDFs
and substructure of EW jets. Those new splitting functions originate precisely from the terms that
are neglected by GET.1 It then becomes mandatory to account for all the terms that from the
longitudinal polarization vector in calculation. Obviously we need a better solution for the power
counting problem.
A physical gauge in a massive gauge theory can be defined by the gauge-fixing condition n ·W =
1

The mistake of the naive power counting is that it neglects that a physical process is intrinsically multi-scaled.
The terms neglected by GET has soft singularities (with infrared cut-offs provided by the masses) that give rise
√
to contributions up to single logarithms, when the collinear scale λ lies in mW ≪ λ ≪ s.

3
0, with n being any direction other than k2 , is able to serve this purpose [6–9]. Heuristically we can
argue this way: GET is the consequence of gauge symmetry. It can be derived from Ward identities
of the theory. Nevertheless, there is also an alternative and a more direct way to prove GET, i.e. we
can simply choose another gauge. Since in a physical gauge we only impose gauge-fixing on gauge
fields, the gauge-goldstone mixing term in the Lagrangian remains, thus we are forced to identify
gauge fields W µ and goldstone fields φ as single fields, which we can denote as W M = (W µ , φ).
In the resulting gauge-goldstone propagator, goldstone modes and gauge modes obtain the same
pole masses, the longitudinal polarization vectors are naturally identified as mixture of gauge
components and goldstone components. We can write the longitudinal polarization vector as
µ
µ
mW µ
ǫM
L = (ǫn , −i), with ǫn ∼ − E n in high energy limit. Its specific form depends on the gauge

direction n. In this way, we obtain a precise formula of scattering amplitudes involving longitudinal
vector bosons, which is a generalization of GET in Eq.(1),

M(WL , WL , WL , ...., WL ) = (−i)n M(φ, φ, φ, ...., φ) + (−i)n−1 M(Wn , φ, φ, ...., φ)
+.... + M(Wn , Wn , Wn , ...., Wn )

(2)

The polarization vectors of Wn are given by ǫn , which is usually neglected by GET. Thus physical
gauges are vastly different from Rξ gauge, in which the masses of the goldstone bosons are gaugedependent. Of course, physical results cannot be gauge-dependent. The author in [19] obtained
similar results as Eq.(2) based on Feynman gauge by making use of BRST symmetry to redefine
the physical state. An earlier attempt along this line can be found in [18]. The longitudinal
polarization and related scattering amplitudes in physical gauges agree precisely with those in Rξ
gauge in [19][18] if the gauge direction is chosen as nµ = (1, −k̂), with k̂ =

|~k|
~k .

Thus the two

approaches are equivalent with each other. Nevertheless, comparing to Rξ gauge, physical gauges
provide a much more clear physical picture as there is no gauge-dependent goldstone mass, no
ambiguity in identifying physical states through LSZ reduction formula.
Although the power counting problem is overcome in a physical gauge, there is also a drawback:
the Feynman rules become complicated, as we need to sum over all the terms from both gauge
components and goldstone components. The problem becomes especially severe if the number
of longitudinal states are multiplied. Besides, the derivation of the gauge-goldstone propagators
2

Traditionally a physical gauge is defined for nµ along a fixed direction, e.g. nµ = (1, 0, 0, 1)T . Here we adopt a
more general definition, which includes n being momentum dependent, e.g. Coulomb gauge[9]. Other examples of
momentum dependent “physical” gauge can be found in [6] and [10].

4
seems also to be complicated due to the gauge-goldstone mixing terms in the Lagrangian. The
goal of this paper is to investigate and reorganize the Feynman rules of massive gauges in physical
gauges by combining gauge fields and goldstone fields together. The strategy is, as mentioned
above, to treat gauge fields and goldstone fields uniformly as 5-component fields W M = (W µ , φ),
and exploit possible underlying structures to simplify. The model we choose is the θW → 0 limit of
the Standard Model of EW interactions, so the gauge group is SU (2)L instead of SU (2)L × U (1).
The motivation is that if custodial symmetry is preserved, both the gauge fields and goldstone
fields transform as a triplet under SU (2) global symmetry. It then becomes straightforwardly
to combine gauge components and goldstone components. Additionally, it’s noteworthy that the
new Feynman rules can also apply to Feynman gauge, in which goldstone bosons obtain the same
masses as their corresponding gauge bosons. So we can make use of the Feynman rules describe
µ
here, if the longitudinal polarization vector is taken to be ǫM
L = (ǫn , −i).

Apart from deriving and documenting the Feynman rules, we also investigate all the 3-point
on-shell amplitudes. In recent years, the on-shell approach of scattering amplitudes using spinorhelicity[21][22] has made remarkable progress. However, the success is still largely confined in
massless particles. There have been many papers[23–26] devoted to the massive case, but the topic
still remains largely unexplored. 3-point on-shell amplitudes are the building blocks of on-shell
approach to scattering amplitudes, thus one might hope that clearer understanding of them can
shed some light in the direction. Our basic point is, now that we have two forms of longitudinal
polarization vectors – one from gauge fields only, another from mixture of gauge fields and goldstone
fields – the two forms should give the same amplitudes due to gauge invariance. This match between
two ways of evaluating amplitudes should also be reflected on the 3-point on-shell amplitudes, which
can be appropriately called “on-shell match”. This on-shell match gives a way to explain how the
information of goldstone bosons are “encoded” in gauge fields for the case of 3-point amplitudes.
Another motivation for 3-point on-shell amplitudes is the calculation of collinear splitting functions, which can be reduced to the calculation of 1 → 2 collinear splitting amplitudes. Since
collinear singularity emerges as the internal lines of the Feynman diagrams approach the mass
poles, collinear splitting amplitudes are simply on-shell amplitudes. In light of this observation, we
can simplify the calculation of splitting amplitudes – especially for massive particles – by making
use of the new Feynman rules and the on-shell match condition.
The remaining of this paper is organised as following:
In Section II we write down the Lagrangian of the model, derive all the Feynman rules in
physical gauges. We first derive the propagators and polarizations, we then derive all the vertices

5
systematically. All the Feynman rules at tree level are listed in the appendix A.
In Section III we investigate all 3-point on-shell amplitudes. We first prove all those 3-point
amplitudes satisfy on-shell gauge symmetry, then calculate collinear splitting amplitudes involving
longitudinal vector bosons by making use of the Feynman rules obtained in this paper and on-shell
match condition from on-shell gauge symmetry. Finally we have conclusions.

THE MODEL AND FEYNMAN RULES
A.

Lagrangian

Our goal is to derive the Feynman rules of the Standard Model of Electroweak interactions by
taking the θW → 0 limit. The gauge group is thus SU (2)L only. With the custodial symmetry, the
Higgs potential has symmetry SU (2)L × SU (2)R . We can parametrize the Higgs field by writing
it as

1
H = √ (iσ2 Φ∗ , Φ)
2
with Φ being



Φ=

√1

− i(φ1 − iφ2 )

A more illuminating way to write Higgs doublet H is

1

H = √ (iσ2 Φ∗ , Φ) = (h − iσ a φa )

(3)

The would-be goldstone fields are isolated from the would-be Higgs field in this parametrization,
which will be more convenient to treat the would-be goldstone bosons as the 5th component of the
vector fields/states. The full Lagrangians are written as

Propagator

In this section we are deriving the propagator of vector bosons, which has intrinsic mixing
between gauge modes and goldstone modes. Combining the kinetic terms in Eq.(7), Eq.(9) and
Eq.(10), the quadratic Lagrangian terms for gauge fields and goldstone fields are

We note that Eq.(15) is not only true for the SU (2)L theory, but applies to any model with
Higgs mechanism. We write gauge-goldstone fields as 5-component vector fields WaM = (Waµ , φa ),
then the kinetic Lagrangian terms can be written as following up to terms with total derivative,

It looks the same as the kinetic Lagrangian terms of massless gauge theory, except µ becomes M .
This similarity is not just a nice way of writing all the Lagrangian terms. Indeed, noticing the
Fourier transformation of ∂ M = (∂ µ , −mW ) gives kM = (kµ , −imW ) for inwards momentum, and
k∗M = (kµ , imW ) for outwards momentum, we could write the dot product of kM as

k · k∗ = gM N kM k∗N = k2 − m2W

(17)

This equals 0 when on-shell, just as k · k = k2 = 0 when on-shell for massless case. Thus all the

algebra with the tensor g µν and kµ , could be applied straightforwardly to gM N and kM /k∗N , with
nM = (nµ , 0). For massless gauge fields, the kinetic Lagrangian after gauge fixing is

Notice the “metric” gM N = dig(1, −1, −1, −1, −1) induces a minus sign between amplitudes
involving gauge component and goldstone component. In practical calculations it’s more convenient
to absorb this minus sign into the polarization vectors, which become

For the lepton sector we simply make the replacement (u → ν, d → l) and VCKM → VPMNS .
Finally we comment on a subtlety in the derivation of Feynman rules: since W and φ are simply
different components of the same physical fields, it’s necessary to sum over all possible contractions
in deriving Feynman rules. This operation gives an additional overal factor to the Feynman rules.
For example, the overal factor of vertex hhhh is 4! = 24. However, sometimes it requires writing
different terms explicitly. This is especially true in the case of gauge-goldstone fields, in which the
gauge components and goldstone components appear to be different fields. For example, in LhW 2

ON-SHELL MATCH FOR 3-POINT AMPLITUDES
A.

On-shell Gauge Symmetry

Having derived all the Feynman rules in a physical gauge. We proceed to analyse the onshell gauge symmetry, especially how they are reflected in 3-point amplitudes. So far we have
concluded that a longitudinal polarization in a physical gauge is composed of gauge components
ǫµn and goldstone component i/ − i, as in Eq.(21). We choose n2 = 0, i.e. light-cone gauge, the
longitudinal polarization vector in 5-component becomes:




ǫM
1L =

ǫµn1
i



(35)



for incoming particles, and ǫ∗M
for outgoing particles. Here ǫµn1 = − nm1W·k nµ1 . On the other hand,
L
we already have the standard form for the longitudinal polarization vector, which can be written
in the 5-component format as




ǫM
2L =

ǫµn2 +

with the 5th component to be 0 and nµ2 = (1, −
and ǫM
2L are related with each other by

(37)

Meanwhile since S-matrix is gauge-invariant, the two forms of longitudinal polarizations have
to give the same S-matrix, i.e.,

Mi

2L ...ǫ2L SM1 ...Mi (k1 ...ki ...) = ǫ1L ...ǫ1L SM1 ...Mi (k1 ...ki ...)

(38)

Plugging in Eq.(37), Eq.(38) is equivalent to

k1M1 ...kiMi SM1 ...Mi (k1 ...ki ...) = 0.

(39)

Interestingly, Eq.(39) share similar form as the on-shell gauge symmetry for massless gauge theory,
with M → µ. Thus, we can appropriately call it “on-shell gauge symmetry” for massive gauge
theory.
W
Ignoring the terms of O( m
n·k ), Eq.(38) reduced to

Mi
1
ǫM
2L ...ǫ2L SM1 ...Mi (k1 ...ki ...) = S(φ1 ...φi ...) + O(

mW
)
n·k

(40)

So on-shell gauge symmetry reduces to goldstone equivalence theorem as in Eq.(1).
In this paper we don’t intend to give a complete proof of on-shell gauge symmetry Rather, we
only set to prove that Eq. (39) is satisfied for all on-shell 3-point amplitudes: W W W , hW W and
f f ′W .
The condition of “on-shell” needs some extra comments, as it’s not always kinematically possible
to put all particles on-shell for 3-point amplitudes. This constraint is usually bypassed by analytical
continuation of making momenta complex. Nevertheless, for hW W and f f ′ W , we can also put
amplitudes on-shell through the analytical continuation of parameters in the theory. For example,
for a decay process h → W + W − , the Higgs mass has to satisfy the on-shell condition mh ≥ 2mW ,
with mh ∼ λh v, mW ∼ gv. We can think of the amplitude as the function of parameters of
theory: M = M(λh , v, g). We can first choose the parameters to satisfy the on-shell condition,
but the resulting amplitude will have to be the same for all possible values of parameters within
the perturbative limits. The same argument can be applied to f → f ′ W , whose amplitude can be

15
seen as the function of yf , yf ′ , g, v: M = M(λf , λ′f , g, v). Notice this argument doesn’t apply to
W W W , since the amplitude is controlled by only one coupling g. It’s not possible to adjust g to
put the all the particles on-shell.
For the convention, we absorb the intrinsic minus sign between gauge components and goldstone
components in amplitudes to the definition of polarization vectors, which are given by Eq.(24) with
g44 = 1, n2 = 0,



g44 = 1 :



ǫ∗M
L =



with ǫµn = − m

In proving the on-shell gauge symmetry for 3-point amplitudes, kM /k∗M also need to be rede-

fined to



kLM = 

kµ
imW





kL∗M = 

kµ

However, in the transverse condition and on-shell condition for kM , the intrinsic minus sign
between gauge components and goldstone component still need to be taken into account, i.e. we
have

∗ L
kM ǫ∗L
M = kM ǫM = k · ǫn + mW = 0
∗
kM kM
= k∗M kM = k2 − m2W = 0

We also extract the factor “i” out for S-matrix by defining S = iM. Our convention is that all
particles are incoming.

, there are

two cases for the polarizations of particle 2: a) transverse b) longitudinal. We start with case a)
with s2 = ±. In this case ǫ4s2 = 0, so there is no goldstone component contribution from particle

Then we turn to case b) s2 = L, so the polarization vector has both gauge components ǫµ2n and

as well as the transverse condition for ǫM

with particle 1 and 2 being fermions, particle 3 being W boson. Since only particle 3 is W

The first term is the amplitude from the fermion-fermion-gauge vertex, the second term is from
the fermion-fermion-goldstone vertex. Let’s check Eq. (42) explicitly. First look at the first term,
to fix all the momenta to be incoming, we choose particle 1 to be a d-type anti-quark, particle 2
to be a d-type quark, then the W boson has to be W + , we also set the CKM matrix to be 1, the

well as ν̄L/R (k1 )/

. Combining Eq. (43) and Eq. (44), we finish the proof of Eq. (42).

Although we only went through the example of d¯1 u2 W3+ , it can be checked straightforwardly that
Eq. (42) is satisfied for all other cases. Having ignoring the CKM matrix ū1 d2 W3− is identical

18
to d¯1 u2 W3+ . For neutral current, i.e. W being W 3 , the proof is also identical except we need to
replace γ µ with

√1 γ µ T3
2

for the fermion-fermion-gauge vertex, and replace γ 5 with

√1 γ 5 T3
2

for the

fermion-fermion-goldstone vertex. It’s also not hard to see that the conclusion also applies to the
SM with the gauge group being SU (2)L × U (1)Y , in which case the only difference is the neutral
current case. For f f γ, iM|ǫµ3 →kµ = 0 according to ward identity. For f f Z, the fermion-fermiongoldstone vertex is identical to the SU (2) case; for the fermion-fermion-gauge vertex, ignoring the
overall factor difference, there is an additional term of vector current Qf sin2 θW relative to the
SU (2) case. Nevertheless, this term gives 0 when kµ dots into the S-matrix because the interaction
is vector-like. So we conclude Eq. (42) is satisfied for the SM too. Indeed, since the argument is
very general, we expect Eq. (42) applies to any massive gauge theory with Higgs mechanism.

W-W-W
Next we proceed to prove Eq. (42) for the amplitude of W W W . Stripping of the overall factor
of −ig, the general amplitude of W W W can be written as
1
iM(1s1 2s2 3s3 ) = (ǫ1 · ǫ2 − ǫ41 · ǫ42 )[(p1 − p2 ) · ǫ3 ] + cyclic
2
Replacing one of the polarizations are replaced by

kM
mW

(45)

, there are three different cases for the

other two polarizations: a) two transverse; b) one transverse and one longitudinal; c) two longitudinal. We start from case a), since both particle 1 and particle 2 are transverse their goldstone
components are 0: ǫ41 = ǫ42 = 0. Consequently, there is no goldstone contribution in this case, so
we have

This means the on-shell gauge symmetry for 1T 2T 3s3 is directly analogue to the massless case,

In the second step we made use of energy-momentum conservation, on-shell conditions and
transverse conditions for particle 1 and 2 respectively,

k1 + k2 + k3 = 0
k12 − k22 = m2W − m2W = 0

(48)

k1 · ǫT1 = k2 · ǫT2 = 0
Next we turn to case b) with particle 1 being transverse and particle 2 being longitudinal, we

(50)

Thus combining case a), case b) and case c), we have proved that on-shell gauge symmetry
is satisfied for all possible 3-point amplitudes: h-W -W , f -f ′ -W , W -W -W . However, our proof

20
still has two loop holes: the first one is only one W state is replaced by

kM
mW

, the second one

is particles are assumed to be incoming. Here we demonstrate neither of the two assumptions
affect the conclusion. Starting with the first one, to prove the general case of arbitrary number
of polarizations of W being replaced by
components

ǫµn

kM
mW

, we need only notice that by replacing the gauge

with kµ , the transverse condition for the longitudinal polarization

k∗M ǫLM = 0
turns to the on-shell condition for kM ,

k∗M kM = 0.
Since in the proof above, the only conditions we used are on-shell condition for kM and transverse
conditions for ǫM
s , the proof of Eq. (41) is exactly the same for multiple polarization vectors being
replaced by

kM
mW

.

The second loophole is automatically fixed if crossing symmetry is satisfied. Under k → −k,

µ
µ
∗M
the incoming longitudinal state becomes ǫM
L (−k) = −ǫL (k), as ǫn (−k) = −ǫn (k). So we get

the longitudinal polarization vector for the outgoing state up to a minus sign. Energy-momentum
conservation becomes

X
i

ki + k = 0 →

X

ki + (−k) = 0

i

Thus we obtain the amplitude for one particle being outgoing if its momentum is under k → −k.
So crossing symmetry is indeed satisfied. Moreover, kM /k∗M turns to −k∗M / − kM under k → −k.

Therefore, we finished our proof of on-shell gauge symmetry for all 3-point amplitudes.

B.

1 → 2 Splitting Amplitudes

In this section we are demonstrating how to use the new Feynman rules and the on-shell match
condition from on-shell gauge symmetry to do calculations. Our examples are 1 → 2 collinear

21
splitting amplitudes involving longitudinal vector bosons: WL → WL WL , h → WL WL and f →
f ′ WL . Those splitting amplitudes have been calculated in [6]. However, as we will see, with the

new prescriptions the calculations become largely simplified.
When external states of a process become collinear with each other, one internal lines of one
of the Feynman diagrams will approach its pole or mass singularity. The amplitude can then be
factorised in the following way

iM =

X
s

iMssplit ·

k32

i
· iMs0 + power suppressed
− m23

(51)

Thus the splitting amplitude Msplit should be evaluated on-shell. The collinear splitting amplitudes Msplit are related to collinear splitting functions in the following way[6],

dP
∝ |Msplit |2
dzdkT2

(52)

So evaluating collinear splitting functions is reduced to evaluating splitting amplitudes.

h → WL+ WL−
The splitting amplitude for h(k3 ) → WL+ (k1 )WL− (k2 ) can be more conveniently calculated using

the simplest way is to choose n1 = n2 = n3 = n, which corresponds to the conventional light-cone

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we derived the Feynman rules of massive gauge theory in physical gauges. The
model is θW → 0 limit of the standard model with gauge group SU (2)L . The main novelty is that
we treat gauge fields and goldstone fields uniformly as 5-component vector fields: W M = (W µ , φ).

Making use of the new notation, we derived the propagator for vector bosons. We noticed there is a
remarkable similarity between massless gauge theory and massive gauge theory in the algebra level,
making the derivation almost trivial. We also derived the Feynman rules for vertices. Especially,
we found that gauge-gauge-gauge vertex and goldstone-goldstone-gauge vertex can be combined
into single W-W-W vertex with a common factor ǫabc , which is obviously due to the remaining
custodial symmetry in the scalar potential.

25
We also investigated the structure of 3-point on-shell amplitudes. We demonstrated that all
3-point on-shell amplitudes – W-W-W, h-W-W, f -f ′ -W – satisfy on-shell gauge symmetry, which
is a reflection of on-shell gauge symmetry for general S-matrix. This on-shell gauge symmetry
ensures that amplitudes calculated with the new Feynman rules and with the usual Feynman rules
are equivalent. We call this equivalence on-shell match condition. Finally, making use of the new
Feynman rules and on-shell match condition for 3-point amplitudes, we calculated some collinear
splitting amplitudes in massive gauge theory.
