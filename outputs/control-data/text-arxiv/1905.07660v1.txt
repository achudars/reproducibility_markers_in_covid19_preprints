Abstract: We investigate the existence of ground state solutions of a Gross-Pitaevskii
equation modeling the dynamics of pumped Bose Einstein condensates (BEC). The main
interest in such BEC comes from its important nature as macroscopic quantum system,
constituting an excellent alternative to the classical condensates which are hard to realize
because of the very low temperature required. Nevertheless, the Gross Pitaevskii equation governing the new condensates presents some mathematical challenges due to the
presence of the pumping and damping terms. Following a self-contained approach, we
prove the existence of ground state solutions of this equation under suitable assumptions:
This is equivalent to say that condensation occurs in these situations. We also solve the
Cauchy problem of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and prove some corresponding
laws.

Introduction

The first realization of condensation has been obtained experimentally in a system consisting of about half million alkali atoms cooled down to nano-Kelvin temperature. Thus,
a considerable obstacle in the study of (BEC) is the very low temperature required to
create the condensate. Completely aware that it is extremely important to explore what
kind of condensates can undergo condensation at higher temperatures, huge efforts have
been undertaken by scientists to overcome this difficulty right after the first experimental
realization of the first (BEC) in 1995. During the last years, a new kind of condensates
has attracted the attention of many scientists. Very recently, it turned out that an excellent candidate is a system of exciton-polaritons, which are bosonic quasiparticles that
exist inside semiconductor micro-cavities, consisting of a superposition of an exciton and
a cavity photon. Above a threshold density, the polaritons macroscopically occupy the
same quantum state, forming a condensate. The temperatures that are usually used to
form exciton-polariton BECs are around T=10K, far higher than the nano-Kelvin temperatures required for atomic BECs. They are immensely promising in terms of new
quantum technologies since quantum effects can appear on a macroscopic level, unlike
1

most systems where quantum effects are rather easily destroyed by temperature and
decoherence. As Boson particles are composed of quantum well excitons and optical
cavity photons, microcavity exciton-polaritons possess unique intrinsic features: reminiscent excitonic nature leads to important interaction dynamics among exciton-polaritons.
Polariton-polariton repulsive interactions are indeed crucial to stimulate scattering processes in order to relax into the ground state Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Since
the temperature of condensation is inversely proportional to the mass of the particles,
the exciton-polariton systems afford relatively high temperatures of condensation. The
first drawback of these new condensates is their very short lifetime (approximately 1 ps),
inherited also from their photonic component, so that polariton thermalization could be
problematic. In fact the polariton gas can become fully thermalized, as a result of strong
polariton-polariton interaction caused by their excitonic component. The second important inconvenient comes from the fact that the excitons disappear with the recombination
of the electron-hole pairs through emission of photons. One way to overcome these problems is to introduce a polariton reservoir: polaritons are “cooled”and “pumped”from this
reservoir into the condensate. At the same time, a low density level is kept in order to
reduce the interactions between polaritons. Different mathematical models have been
suggested for this new condensate. In this paper we consider the one proposed in [16],
called complex Gross-Pitaevski equation. For a more detailed account of these aspects,
see [23] and references therein.
In [23], the authors addressed the nature of radially symmetric standing wave-type
solutions of the following nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation:
i

∂ψ
= (−∆ + V (x) + |ψ|2 )ψ + i(σ(x) − α|ψ|2 )ψ,
∂t

(GPPD)

where ψ = ψ(x, t) is a complex-valued function defined on R2 × R, ∆ is the Laplace
operator on R2 , V (x) = |x|2 is the harmonic potential, σ(x) ≥ 0 and α ≥ 0.
To achieve their goals, they have developed a numerical collocation method but they
did not provide any theoretical justification of their claims. The main objective of this
paper is to rigorously prove the existence of ground state solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation under study. We believe that this is a challenging and immensely important
scientific question. The principle challenge comes from the fact that all classical methods
do not seem to be applicable to discuss the existence of stationary solutions to (GPPD).
This is essentially due to the simultanous presence of the dissipation and pumping terms
simultaneously. Let us note that the establishment of ground state solutions avoids
costly and very difficult experiments in the “classical”BEC. To achieve this goal, let us
first introduce some important quantities associated to (GPPD).
Recall that the mass M, the Hamiltonian H, the action Sµ (µ > 0) and the functional

K associated to the equation (GPPD) are given by:
M(u) := kuk2L2 ,

Z

R2

(σ − α|ψ|2 )(|ψ|4 + V |ψ|2 + |∇ψ|2 ) − 2α(R(ψ∇ψ̄))2 dx.

(1.6)

Identity (1.5) shows that, at least formally, the mass and the energy are pumped into
the system through the term iσψ involving the parameter σ and they are nonlinearly
damped by the term −iα|ψ|2 ψ involving the parameter α. Contrarily to the complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation (when a dissipatif term of the form i∆ψ is added to the RHS
of (GPDP)), one cannot obtain time-uniform estimates of the solution in the energy
space. The complex Gross-Pitaevski equation reflects the non-equilibrium dynamics described above by adding pumping and decaying terms to the GP equation.
Before going any further, we recall a few results about the linear equation without dissipation and pumping. The equation then reads
i

∂φ
= (−∆ + V (x))φ.
∂t

We define the energy space Σ := H 1 (R2 ) ∩ {u : xu ∈ L2 }, endowed with the L2 -scalar
R
product (u, v)2 := R2 u(x)v̄(x) dx, by
1

(u, v)Σ = (∇u, ∇v)2 + (xu, xv)2 + (u, v)2 : kuk2Σ = k∇uk22 + (1 + (| · |2 ) 2 u

2
2

.

Also, define the dual space Σ∗ of Σ as follows. For any v ∈ Σ∗ , there exists a unique
u ∈ Σ such that H0 u = v with the norm on Σ∗ given by
kH0 ukΣ∗ = kvkΣ∗ := kukΣ .
Recall that k·kp is the norm in Lp (R2 ). It is well known that the unbounded operator
H0 := −∆ + V defined on
H0 (u) ∈ L2 (R2 )}

D(H0 ) := {u ∈ Σ :
3

is self-adjoint. Moreover, the lowest eigenvalue of H0 denoted by ω1 = 2 is simple with
2
eigenfunction ϕ1 (x) = √1π e−|x| /2 . Notice that (ϕ1 , ω1 ) can be constructed variationally
as
1
ω1 = min
kukL2 =1 2

Z

R2

|∇u|2 + |x|2 |u|2 dx := min H0 .
kukL2 =1

In particular, for any u ∈ D(H0 ), we have
2kuk2L2 ≤ kxuk2L2 + k∇uk2L2 .
For more details, we refer for example to [15].
When the chemical potential is complex µ = µr + iµi , solitary wave solution ψ(x, t) =
Q(x)e−itµ = Q(x)etµi e−itµr would grow exponentially fast as |t| → ∞ which can be bad
for the analysis as well as for numerics and experiments. Assuming that µ = µr , yields
the following stationary problem for Q:
µQ = (−∆ + V (x) + |Q|2 )Q + i(σ(x) − α|Q|2 )Q,

Q ∈ Σ \ {0}.

(µ-SP)

Multiplying (µ-SP) by Q̄ and integrating gives the following identity.
µM(Q) = 2H(Q) + 1/2kQk4L4 + iK(Q).
The condition for the chemical potential µ of being real is then equivalent to the fact
that Q is a zero of K.
It is important to emphasize that due to the presence of the dissipation and pumping mechanisms, we find it hard to apply the standard variational or PDE methods to
construct soliton-type solutions of (GPPD) (i.e. a solution Q of (µ-SP)). In this paper,
our idea to construct a solution of (µ-SP) with real chemical potential µ goes along a
perturbative way by introducing a small parameter factor in the dissipation and pumping
term. More precisely, for all ε > 0, consider
∂ψ
= (−∆ + V (x) + |ψ|2 )ψ + iε(σ(x) − α|ψ|2 )ψ,
∂t
and its corresponding stationary equation
i

µQ = (−∆ + V (x) + |Q|2 )Q + iε(σ(x) − α|Q|2 )Q

Q ∈ Σ \ {0}.

(GPPDε )

(µ-SPε )

The object is to construct a solution (Qε , µε ) in the form
Qε = Qaε + ψε ,

and

µε = µaε + µε ,

where the approximate solution (Qaε , µaε ) will be given explicitly, and (ψε , µε ) is the error
term that needs to be found. To define (Qaε , µaε ), we need to introduce some notation and
state a few preliminary useful results. The first Theorem of this paper reads as follows:
4

Theorem 1.1. Let σ(x) ≥ 0 be a continuous nontrivial function. There exist α0 ≫
1 and a positive ε0 small such that, for any 0 < ε < ε0 and α > α0 , the complex
Gross-Pitaevkii equation (GPPDε ) has a solitary wave solution ψ ε (x, t) = eitµε Qε (x)
with (Q, µε ) ∈ Σ × (2, ∞) solving µ-SPε .
Remark 1.1. It would be very desirable to extend the branch of standing wave solutions
we constructed for ε small to all values of ε. Unfortunately, so far we were not able to
do so given the non-equilibrium structure of the model.
Our second result concerns the Cauchy problem associated to (GPPD). We have.
Theorem 1.2. Assume α ≥ 0, and σ ∈ L∞ (R2 ) ∩ L4 (R2 ). For any ψ0 ∈ L2 (R2 ), there
exists a unique global solution ψ ∈ C([0, ∞), L2 (R2 )) ∩ L4loc ([0, ∞), L4 (R2 )) of (GPPD)
with ψ(x, 0) = ψ0 (x). Moreover, for any T > 0, we have

The paper is organized as follows: In the next section, some preliminary results are
proven. This will prepare the field to the establishment of ground state solutions. In
section 3, we will present our self-contained proof built up to prove the existence of ground
state solutions. The last section of this paper is dedicated to the Cauchy problem. We
show the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a large class of damping and pumping
terms. We also discuss the non-conservation of some important functionals associated to
the Schrödinger equation.

Preliminaries

Here we focus on the problem without pumping and decay of the energy, that is when
ε = 0. We start by recalling a few known facts about the space Σ, for which the proof
can for example be found in Kavian-Weissler [15].
Lemma 2.1. The Hilbert space Σ is compactly embedded in Lp (R2 ) for any p ∈ [2, ∞).
Throughout this paper, we suppose that σ ≥ 0 is nontrivial continuous and is in
function.

L∞ (R2 )

Lemma 2.2. For any M > 0, there exists a unique vM ∈ Σ solving the following
constrained variational problem:
Z
(VM ) : µM = inf{H(u) : u2 = M };
In addition, vM is non-negative, radial and radially decreasing.

5

Proof. It is sufficient to show the existence of a minimizer of (VM ). The uniqueness of
the minimizer follows directly from the strict convexity of the functional H.
Now let us fix M > 0, let (vn ) be a minimizing sequence of (VM ), i.e., limn→∞ H(vn ) =
R
µM and vn2 = M . Then
H(vn ) ≥

1
1
k∇vn k22 + kxvn k22 .
2
2

Therefore, we can find KM > 0 such that
k∇vn k22 + kxvn k22 ≤ KM .
This implies that
kvn k2Σ ≤ M + KM .

(2.1)

Consequently, there exists u ∈ Σ such that
vn ⇀ u

in Σ.

This implies, thanks to Lemma 2.1, that vn → u in L2 (R2 ) and L4 (R2 ). Thus, we
R
certainly have that u2 = M implying that u is non-trivial, and by the lower semicontinuity, we can write:
H(u) ≤ lim inf H(vn ) = µM .
n

Therefore, H(u) = µM . On the other hand, let u be the unique minimizer of (VM ), then
u is a non-negative function in Σ since
H(|u|) ≤ H(u),

and M (|u|) = M (u).

Furthermore, by rearrangement inequalities [12, 13], we have:

|u|2 = (|u|∗ )2

The next Lemma, addresses the regularity of the Hamiltonian H, as well as the map
M → µM .
6

Lemma 2.3. The Hamiltonian H is in C 1 (Σ, R). Moreover, for all u ∈ Σ we have
kH′ (u)kΣ−1 ≤ C{kukΣ + kuk3Σ }

for all

u ∈ Σ,

(i)

is continuous on

(0, ∞).

(ii)

and the function
M → µM = H(vM ),

Proof. The proof of (i) follows from standard arguments. For example, we refer to reference [14], and we just prove (ii).
Fix M > 0. Let Mn ⊂ (0, ∞) be a sequence of positive real numbers such that Mn → M .
We will first prove that
lim sup µMn ≤ µM .
(2.2)

Let (vn ) be a sequence such that
L > 0 such that

Now let wn =

then

vn2 = M and H(vn ) → µM . By (2.1), we can find

for any n ∈ N.
Therefore, we can find n0 such that
kvn − wn kΣ ≤ L + 1
for any n ≥ n0 .
It follows from (i) that there exists a constant K(L) such that kH′ (u)kΣ−1 ≤ K(L)
for all u ∈ Σ such that kukΣ ≤ 2L + 1.
Thus, for all n ≥ n0 ,

Then lim sup µMn ≤ lim H(vn ) = µM and then

lim sup µMn ≤ µM .

(2.3)

Now let us prove that if Mn → M , then
µM ≤ lim inf µMn .

µMn ≤ H(vn ) ≤ µMn +

Combining the proof of (2.1) and (2.4), we can find K > 0 such that kvn kΣ ≤ K for all

Thus, following the proof of (2.4), we certainly get:

yielding lim inf µMn ≥ µM as desired.
Proposition 2.4. Let M > 0, and (Mn ) ⊂ (0, ∞) be a sequence of positive real numbers
such that Mn → M . Denote by vMn the unique minimizer of (VMn ), and vM the unique
minimizer of (VM ). Then
K(vMn ) → K(vM ),
and
H(vMn ) → H(vM ).
Proof. We will first prove that there exists ū ∈ Σ such that vMn converges weakly in Σ
to ū (vMn ⇀ ū in Σ). First obviously kvMn k22 ≤ A. Now noticing that
1

µMn = k∇vMn k22 + kxvMn k22 + kvMn k24 ,

one has

1
µMn ≥ k∇vMn k22 + kxvMn k22 .
2
2
Therefore, using (2.4), there exists a constant B > 0 such that
kvMn kΣ ≤ B.
Thus, (up to a subsequence), there exists ū ∈ Σ such that
vMn ⇀ ū

in Σ.

Now using Lemma 2.1, we have that
vMn → ū

in L2 (R2 ) ∩ L4 (R2 ).
8

In particular,

R

ū2 = M . Thus,
µM ≤ H(ū) ≤ lim inf H(vMn ) = lim inf µMn

and then H(ū) = µM . This shows that ū is the unique minimizer of (VM ). To end the
proof, we need to show that

(2.6)

To prove (2.5), it is sufficient to notice that σ ∈ L∞ (R2 ) and vn → v in L2 (R2 ), while
(2.6) follows from the fact that vn → u in L4 (R2 ).

Ground State Solutions

Always in the case ε = 0, and within the class of minimizers vM we have just constructed,
we would like to intersect it with the co-dimension one manifold characterized by the zeros
of the functional K. Before doing so, let us first fix our assumptions on the decay and
pumping parameters.
First we deal with case ε = 0 i.e. the standard nonlinear Schrödinger equation in the
absence of both the pumping and dissipation. Equation (µ-SPε ) then becomes
µQ = (−∆ + V (x) + |Q|2 )Q,

Q ∈ Σ \ {0}.

(µ-SP0 )

The first preliminary result is the first iteration. We have the following result:
Proposition 3.1. There exists a non-negative radial function Q0 ∈ Σ and µ0 > 2 solving
(µ-SP0 ). Moreover, Q0 satisfies
K(Q0 ) = 0.
Remark 3.1. (Q0 , µ0 ) will be the first approximate solution in the iteration process to
construct the full solution (Qε , µε ) of (µ-SPε ).
Proof of Proposition 3.1. It is sufficient to prove that the functional K changes sign when
the mass of the ground state vM given by Lemma 2.2 varies. Then the conclusion will
follow using Lemma 2.3. Now, because of the positivity of vM , first observe that for any
R
nontrivial non-negative continuous function σ, we have R2 σ|vM |2 dx > 0. Moreover, on
the one hand, by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, there is a constant C∗ > 0 such
that for any u ∈ H 1 , we have
kuk4L4 ≤ C∗ k∇uk2L2 kuk2L2 .

9

On the other hand, multiplying (µ-SP0 ) by ū and integrating shows that any solution u
of (µ-SP0 ) satisfies
µkuk2L2 = k∇uk2L2 + kxuk2L2 + kuk4L4 .
Thus, if kuk2L2 = M we have

kuk4L4 . M 2 µM .

R
This shows that when M ≤ 1, we have µM . 1 and thus K(uM ) ≥ R2 σ|u|2 dx − CM 2 ,
for some positive constant C. Now since σ ≥ 0 is a nontrivial continuous function, there
exists a nontrivial open set O ⊂ R2 and a positive constant c0 > 0 such that σ(x) ≥ c0 ,
R
R
for all x ∈ O. We have R2 σ|u|2 dx ≥ c0 O |u|2 dx ≥ c1 M , for some small positive
constant c1 . This implies that K(uM ) ≥ 0 as M → 0. Now, we need to show that K(uM )
becomes negative for large masses. In fact, first we will prove that

If we let Hint (u) := 12 (kxuk2L2 + 21 kuk4L4 ), then clearly
Hint (uM ) ≤ H(uM ).

From the above bounds, let us just denote by u (instead of uM ), an L2 -weak limit of
(un ). Denote by fn := u2n . First we show that kf kL1 (R2 ) = M . Up to an extraction, we
may assume that a subsequence of (fn ) (also denoted by (fn )) converges weakly to f in
the sense of distributions; that is for any ϕ ∈ C0∞ (R2 ) (smooth and compactly supported
function), we have

leading to a contradiction by taking n → ∞.Clearly, (3.6) shows that K(uM ) becomes
negative as M → ∞ which finishes the proof.
Notice that to construct a nonlinear solution to (µ-SP0 ), one can use several techniques. Variationnally, for any given amount of mass M > 0, we have shown that a
radial positive solution (uM , µM ) to (µ-SP0 ) can be constructed through the following
minimizing problem
µM = H(uM ) := min H(u).
kuk2 2 =M
L

Moreover, this family of solutions is included in the branch of solutions constructed using
bifurcation arguments pioneered by Rabinowitz, and Crandall-Rabinowitz [7]. Indeed,
(u, µ) is a solution to (µ-SP0 ) if and only if (I − µK)u = N (u), where K = A−1 B,
N = A−1 G′ (u), and the operators A, B and G are defined by
A : Σ → Σ∗ ,

for any

B : Σ → Σ∗ ,

u, v ∈ Σ; < Au, v >:= (∇u, ∇v)2 + (xu, xv)2 ,

and

u ∈ Σ; G(u) = − kuk4L4 .

Indeed, the following proposition shows that a branch of solutions of (µ-SP0 ) emerging
from the linear solution (ϕ1 , ω1 ) can be constructed. The proof of the proposition is
included in the proof of the spectral assumption given in the Appendix. (See section 5).

u(η) ∈ Σ, µ(η) > 2 of (µ-SP0 ) exists such that
u(η) =

√
η(a(η)ϕ1 + z(η)),

with z ∈ Σ, z(0) = 0 and (z(η), ϕ1 )2 = 0.
For the solution (Q0 , µ0 ) to (µ-SP0 ) satisfying K(Q0 ) = 0 given by Proposition 3.1,
denote by
L− := −∆ + V + Q20 − µ0 ,
and
L+ := −∆ + V + 3Q20 − µ0 .
The second preliminary result concerns the operators L± . We have the following
important property of L± .
Proposition 3.3. Let < Q0 >⊥ be the subspace of Σ consisting of all functions L2 orthogonal to Q0 . Then we have
ker(L− ) = {Q0 },

and

L− :< Q0 >⊥ →< Q0 >⊥

is bijective.

Moreover, there exists α0 > 0 such that for all α > α0 ,
L+ : Σ → Σ ∗

is bijective.

The property of L+ comes from the breakdown of the spatial translation symmetry
due to the presence of the potential. We refer to the Appendix (Section 5) for the proof
of proposition 3.3 .
We have
L+ (Q0 ) = 2Q30 .

(3.7)

Since K(Q0 ) = (Q0 , (σ − α|Q0 |2 )Q0 )2 = 0, then thanks to Proposition 3.3, one can
uniquely define Q1i by
L− Q1i := (α|Q0 |2 − σ)Q0 .

13

Observe that given the smoothness and the decay of Q0 , we have Q1i ∈ DomL− . Moreover, we have
2
L−1
+ : L → Dom(L+ ) is bounded, and

L+ (Q1i ) = αQ30 + 2Q20 Q1i − σQ0 .

(3.8)

Now, define Q2r and Q3i by
L+ Q2r = µ2 Q0 + (σ − α|Q0 |2 )Q1i − Q0 Q21i ,

(3.9)

and
L− Q3i = (2Q2r Q0 − Q21i )Q1i + µ2 Q1i + ((2 + α)Q20 − σ)Q2r + Q21i Q0 .

(3.10)

The bijectivity of L+ enables us to determine Q2r , and again the regularity of Q0 shows
that Q2r ∈ DomL+ . Thus it only remains to determine the coefficient µ2 , and Q3i . They
are determined by the orthogonality condition
(L− Q3i , Q0 )2 = 0.
Indeed, substituting Q2r (given by inverting (3.9)) into (3.10) gives

L− Q3i = µ2 [Q1i + ((2 + α)Q20 − σ + 2Q0 Q1i )L−1

(3.12)

Now since (Q0 , Q1i )2 = 0, then clearly

2
2
(L−1
+ ((2 + α)Q0 − σ + 2Q0 Q1i ), Q0 ) = kQ0 kL2 6= 0,

which insures that µ2 is uniquely determined in terms of Q0 , Q1,i which were already
defined. Then Q3i follows by inverting L− using the orthogonality (Q3i , Q0 )2 = 0. Now,
set
Qaε := Q0 + iεQ1i + ε2 Q2r + iε3 Q3i ,

and µaε = µ0 + ε2 µ2 .

The main result of this section is the following.
Theorem 3.1. For σ a heaviside function and α > α0 , there exists ε0 > 0 such that
for all 0 < ε < ε0 , equation (GPPDε ) has a solution (Qε , µε ) ∈ Σ × (2, ∞) that can be
decomposed as
(Qε , µε ) = (Qaε + ψε , µaε + κε ),

(3.15)
(3.16)

Proof of Theorem 3.1. First, we write an equation for (Qε , µε ) being a solution of (µ-SPε ).
We start by further decomposing Qaε = Qaε,r + iQaε,i and observe that
|Qε |2 = |Qaε,r |2 + |Qaε,i |2 + 2Qaε,r ψε,r + 2Qaε,i ψε,i + |ψε,r |2 + |ψε,i |2 .
Substituting this in equation (µ-SPε ) and splitting the real and imaginary parts, we
obtain
(µaε + κε )(Qaε,r + ψε,r ) = (−∆ + V + |Qε |2 )(Qaε,r + ψε,r )
−ε(σ − α|Qε |2 )(Qaε,i + ψε,i ),

(3.17)

and
(µaε + κε )(Qaε,i + ψε,i ) = (−∆ + V + |Qε |2 )(Qaε,i + ψε,i )
+ε(σ − α|Qε |2 )(Qaε,r + ψε,r ),

and Gε can be explicitely computed. In particular it satisfies
kGε (ψε,r , ψε,i , κε )kΣ . ε7 .
Now we define a map Φε : Σ × Σ × (0, ∞) → Σ × Σ × (0, ∞) by
Φε (ψ̃ε,r , ψ̃ε,i , κ̃ε ) = (ψε,r , ψε,i , κε )

then (4.1) has a unique solution

By choosing δ > 0 sufficiently small, the right hand side does not exceed 2δ : X is stable
under the action of Φ. For the contraction, let ψ1 , ψ2 ∈ X :
kΦ(ψ1 ) − Φ(ψ2 )kL4 ([0,T ]×R2 ) ≤ C(1 + α)k|φ1 |2 ψ1 − |ψ2 |2 ψ2 kL4/3 ([0,T ]×R2 )

8

Up to decreasing δ again, the factor on the right hand side does not exceed 1/2 and Φ is
a contraction on X. This proves the existence part of the proposition. The uniqueness
part readily follows from the remark that if ψ ∈ L4 ([0, T ] × R2 ), then [0, T ] can be split
finitely many times on intervals where
kψkL4 (Ij ×R2 ) ≤ 2δ,
so uniqueness on X can be deduced.
Theorem 4.1. Let ψ0 ∈ L2 (R2 ), σ ∈ L4 (R2 ). Then (4.1) has a unique, maximal solution
ψ ∈ C([0, Tmax ); L2 ) ∩ L4loc ([0, Tmax ); L4 (R2 )).
Moreover, in [0, Tmax ):

T →0

Moreover, Proposition 4.2 yields a local solution satisfying (4.1). For the notion of
maximality, we proceed as in [2]. Suppose that ψ ∈ C([0, Tmax ); L2 ) ∩ L4 ([0, Tmax ] × R2 ),
with Tmax finite, and that ψ cannot be extended to larger time. Let t ∈ [0, Tmax ) and
s ∈ [0, Tmax − t). Duhamel’s formula implies

The right hand side is less than δ if t is close to Tmax . Proposition 4.3 shows that ψ can
be extended after Tmax , in contradiction with the definition of Tmax .
Corollary 4.2. If ψ0 ∈ L2 (R2 ) and σ ∈ L4 ∩ L∞ (R2 ), then Tmax = ∞, and for all t ≥ 0,

solution ψ, such that
ψ, ∇ψ, xψ ∈ C([0, ∞); L2 (R2 )) ∩ L4loc ([0, ∞); L4 (R2 )).
The analogue of Proposition 4.2 becomes, if we just assume σ ∈ L∞ (R2 ) :
Proposition 4.7. There exists δ > 0 such that if ψ0 ∈ L2 (R2 ) and T ∈ (0, 1] are such
that
δ
kU (.)ψ0 kL4 ([0,T ]×R2 ) ≤ δ and T kσkL∞ kψ0 kL2 ≤ ,
8
then (4.1) has a unique solution
ψ ∈ C([0, T ]; L2 ) ∩ L4 ([0, T ] × R2 ).
The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 4.2, by working in
Y = {ψ ∈ C([0, T ]; L2 )∩L4 ([0, T ]×R2 ), kψkL4 ([0,T ]×R2 ) ≤ 2δ, kψkL∞ ([0,T ];L2) ≤ 2kψ0 kL2 }.
and estimating
kσψkL1 ([0,T ];L2 ) ≤ T kσkL∞ ([0,T ];L2) .

Appendix: Proof of Proposition 3.3

Proof. We start by proving (i). Consider the minimizing problem
ℓµ0 := inf{< L− v; v >Σ∗ ,Σ : u ∈ Σ and

kvkL2 = 1},

and observe that since L− (Q0 ) = 0, then ℓµ0 ≤ 0.
On the one hand, arguing as in the proof of proposition 3.1, one can easily show that a
minimizer u of the above problem exists. Next, for any test function ϕ, we have
< L− (u + εϕ); (u + εϕ) >Σ∗ ,Σ ≥ ℓµ0 (1 + ε2 kϕk2L2 + 2εRe(u, ϕ)2 ).
That is

ℓµ0

+ ε2 k∇ϕk2L2 + kxϕk2L2 + kQ0 ϕk2L2 − µ0 kϕk2L2



+ 2εRe ((∇u, ∇ϕ)2 + (xu, xϕ)2 + (Q0 u, Q0 ϕ)2 − µ0 (u, ϕ)2 )
≥ ℓµ0 (1 + ε2 kϕk2L2 + 2εRe(u, ϕ)2 ).

Since ε is arbitrary and can have any sign, then we deduce that
L− u = ℓµ0 u,
and therefore u is an eigenvector of L− corresponding to the first (and simple) eigenvalue
ℓµ0 . On the other hand, it follows from Theorem 11.8 in [19] that the minimizer is unique
and up to a phase change, we can take a positive minimizer ũ = eiθ u with θ ∈ R. Now,
to conclude it suffices to show that ℓµ0 = 0. We see from L− Q0 = 0 that
ℓµ0 (ũ, Q0 )2 =< L− ũ; Q0 >Σ∗ ,Σ =< ũ; L− Q0 >Σ∗ ,Σ = 0,
yielding (given that Q0 and ũ are positive) ℓµ0 = 0. This finishes the proof.
Now we prove (ii). The proof of the bijectivity goes through several steps. First we prove
Proposition 3.2. Set

µ = 2+η
√
ηq, where 0 < η << 1.
u =

(5.1)

Then (µ0−SP0 ) reads as
(−∆ + |x|2 − 2)q = η(q − q 3 ).
Now we can decompose q = aϕ1 + ϕ⊥
1 , where ϕ1 is the first simple eigenfunction of the
2
⊥
operator H0 := −∆ + |x| , ϕ1 denotes an element of the vector space L2 -orthogonal to
ϕ1 , and a(η) is a scalar. Therefore, we have

(5.2)

Now let us define the projection Π by: Π(cϕ1 + ϕ⊥

in the following way

We will first solve (5.3) using the implicit function theorem.
First, we notice that for η = 0, and a0 satisfying:
|ϕ1 |22 − a20 |ϕ1 |44 = 0
,we have ϕ⊥
1 (0, a0 ) = 0 is a solution of (5.3). On the other hand,

We have (F (a, ϕ1 ), ϕ1 )2 = 0, which after expansion, leads to
a|ϕ1 |22 − a3 |ϕ1 |44 + O(η) = 0,
that in partcicular yields
− |ϕ1 |22 − 3a2 |ϕ1 |44 < 0,

(5.5)

by an appropriate choice of |η| << 1.
In summary, we can assert that there exists 0 < η0 << 1 such that for all 0 < η < η0 ,
⊥
there exist a unique solution (ϕ⊥
1 , a) = (ϕ1 , a)(η)) solving (5.3)-(5.4). finishing the proof
of Proposition 3.2.
Second, we consider the eigenvalue problem of the linearized operator around u(η)

L+ ϕ = − ∆ + |x|2 − 3(u(η))2 − µ(η) ϕ = λϕ,

(5.6)

and track how the zero eigenvalue of L+ moves for small values of η. Note that since q
(and hence u) decays exponentially fast in space, the operator L+ has a discrete spectrum
with the same asymptotic of the eigenvalues as the Harmonic oscillator. Recalling that
√
µ = η + 2 and u(η) = ηq with q = aϕ1 + ϕ⊥
1 , equation (5.6) is rewritten as
Lη ϕ(η) = λ(η)ϕ(η)
22

with kϕ(η)k22 = 1, and Lη := −∆ + |x|2 − 3ηq 2 − η − 2.
When η = 0, we have λ(0) = 0, ϕ(0) = ϕ1 , and λ(0) is a simple isolated eigenvalue of L0 .
Taking the derivative with respect to η, we obtain at η = 0:

(5.7)

Multiplying the identity (5.7) by ϕ(0) and taking the L2 scalar product, we get

(5.8) is strictly negative by identity (5.5). Therefore,

Third, we show that for small masses M , the ground state QM minimizing VM given
by Lemma 2.2 is indeed equal to the unique u(η) given in proposition (3.2) by choosing
QM
→ ϕ1 and µM → 2, as
M ∼ η << η0 . More precisely, it is sufficient to show that √
M
M → 0 where (−∆ + |x|2 )ϕ1 = 2ϕ1 and kϕ1 k2 = 1.
To prove the latter assertion, let us first notice that

2M

≤ k∇QM k22 + kxQM k22 + kQM k44
≤ 2M + M 2 kϕ1 k44 .

(5.9)

This implies that µM → 2 as M → 0.
QM
Additionally, (5.9) implies that √ = vM is bounded in Σ and satisfies
M
−∆vM + |x|2 vM + M |vM |2 vM = µM vM .
Taking the weak limit in the latter inequality, we deduce that vM → ϕ1 in Σ as M → 0.
QM
is in a neighborhood
Hence, choosing M small enough; M ∼ η << M0 := η0 so that √
M
of ϕ1 in Σ.
In the last part of the proof, we choose

for M < M0 yielding that QM is a zero of the functional K.
