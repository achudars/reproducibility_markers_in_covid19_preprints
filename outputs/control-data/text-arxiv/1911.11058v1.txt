ABSTRACT

We present an orbit-based method of combining stellar and cold gas kinematics to
constrain the dark matter profile of early-type galaxies. We apply this method to earlytype galaxy NGC 2974, using Pan-STARRS imaging and SAURON stellar kinematics
to model the stellar orbits, and introducing H i kinematics from VLA observation as a
tracer of the gravitational potential. The introduction of the cold gas kinematics shows
a significant effect on the confidence limits of especially the dark halo properties: we
exclude more than 95% of models within the 1 − σ confidence level of Schwarzschild
modelling with only stellar kinematics, and reduce the relative uncertainty of the dark
matter fraction significantly to 10% within 5Re. Adopting a generalized-NFW dark
+0.2 when including the
matter profile, we measure a shallow cuspy inner slope of 0.6−0.3
cold gas kinematics in our model. We cannot constrain the inner slope with the stellar
kinematics alone.

INTRODUCTION

Dark matter haloes are not only crucial for investigating the
nature of dark matter and testing cosmological models, but
for galaxy formation and evolution as well. Galaxies form
in dark matter haloes, and the accumulation of baryons reshapes the dark matter haloes. Thus, studying the structure
of dark matter haloes is a way to understand the co-evolution
processes of dark matter and baryons in galaxies.
Several questions related to the dark matter structure
are still under debate, for example, whether dark matter haloes are cusped or cored. N-body simulations show
that the standard ΛCDM model (e.g. Blumenthal et al.
1984; Davis et al. 1985) predicts dark matter haloes to have
steep inner slopes called cusps, which are well described

by a Navarro-Frenk-White profile (NFW; Navarro et al.
1996), while observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies prefer shallow core-like inner slopes which could indicate
warm dark matter particles (Moore 1994; Moore et al.
1999; Battaglia et al. 2008; Walker & Penarrubia 2011).
This question is still undetermined (Zhu et al. 2016b), and
it requires further examination.
The dark matter is expected to dominate the gravitational potential in the outer regions in galaxies. Spatially resolved stellar kinematics obtained with Integral Field
Spectroscopy (IFS) observations, such as the Atlas3D Survey (Cappellari et al. 2011), CALIFA (Sánchez et al. 2012),
SAMI (Croom et al. 2012) and MaNGA (Bundy et al.
2014), have been widely used to trace mass distribution of galaxies (e.g Cappellari et al. 2013a; Li et al. 2017;
Taranu et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2018c). However, these stellar
kinematics only have limited coverage of 1−2 effective radius

Yang et al.

(Re ), as the outer regions of galaxies are faint, which makes
them difficult to observe. Other tracers extending out to over
5Re in galaxies, such as planetary nebulae (PNe), globular
clusters (GCs) and cold gas, are of great importance. Since
Hui & Ford (1993) first reported the possible existence of
dark matter halo measured with PNe kinematics, PNe have
been used to measure dark matter distribution in early-type
galaxies (e.g. Tremblay et al. 1995; Napolitano et al. 2007,
2009). GCs are also good tracers for early-type galaxies (e.g.
Côté et al. 2001, 2003; Zhu et al. 2014; Alabi et al. 2017) because of their ubiquity and adequate luminosity for spectroscopic observation to a far distance (Norris et al. 2012).
Unlike discrete tracers such as PNe and GCs, cold gas is
a continuous tracer following the intrinsic shape of the gravitational potential. There is a long history of ascertaining
the dark matter content of late-type (spiral) galaxies with
cold gas (typically neutral hydrogen H i ), by modelling rotation curves obtained from integrated line profiles and velocity fields (e.g. Bosma 1981; van Albada et al. 1985). H i
discs are also present in early-type galaxies although typically with lower surface brightness as in late-type galaxies
(e.g. Morganti et al. 1997; Oosterloo et al. 2007; Serra et al.
2012). NGC 2974 is one of the well-studied early-type galaxies with cold gas: it is a lenticular galaxy with an extended
regular H i ring (Kim et al. 1988; Weijmans et al. 2008).
Multiple dynamical modelling techniques have been developed to reconstruct the gravitational potential of galaxies and detect their dark matter structure. Jeans models
(Jeans 1922) are applicable for integrable systems with a
distribution function (DF) depending on phase-space coordinates only through integrals of motion (Binney & Tremaine
2011), while the particle-based made-to-measure (M2M)
algorithm (e.g. Syer & Tremaine 1996; De Lorenzi et al.
2007) and the Schwarzschild’s orbit-superposition technique
(Schwarzschild 1979; van den Bosch et al. 2008) regard the
DF as a large ensemble of δ-functions and sidestep the ignorance of integrals of motion.
Even though the dynamical modelling with extended stellar kinematics (to ∼ 4Re ) are able to constrain the dark matter profile in a number of cases
(e.g Forestell & Gebhardt 2010; Cappellari et al. 2015;
Boardman et al. 2016), the combination of central stellar
kinematics (within ∼ 1Re ) and other extended tracers has
expanded the methods to break the degeneracies in galaxies
between dark and luminous matter. The combination of stellar kinematics and discrete tracers with the M2M method
(e.g. De Lorenzi et al. 2008; Das et al. 2011; Morganti et al.
2013) and the Jeans modelling (e.g. Napolitano et al. 2011,
2014; Zhu et al. 2016a; Bellstedt et al. 2018) have provided
crucial measurements of the slope of the dark matter profile. However, the similar combination still lacks application
within Schwarzschild’s modelling technique, which is usually unable to obtain much information of the dark matter without extended tracers, whether modelling individual galaxies including NGC 2974 (Krajnović et al. 2005) or
galaxy populations (e.g. Zhu et al. 2018a). Therefore, we introduce an combination of stellar kinematics modelled by
the Schwarzschild technique, and cold gas kinematics as
a tracer of the gravitational potential at large radii. We
demonstrate this technique by applying it to NGC 2974,
to obtain the dark matter properties of this galaxy.

DATA

To construct our dynamical models of NGC 2974, we make
use of a variety of datasets, that we describe below. We list
the basic properties of NGC 2974 in Table 1.

2.1

Surface Brightness

To trace the stellar mass, we model the surface brightness of NGC 2974 based on r-band imaging taken from the
Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System
(Pan-STARRS). The Pan-STARRS images are stacked from
short exposure images, to reach a limiting magnitude of 23.2
in r-band. For further information on the Pan-STARRS, we
refer the readers to Chambers et al. (2016) and references
therein. In NGC 2974, this correspond to a radius of 3.5 Re
(effective or half-light radii), which is beyond the extent of
our stellar kinematic data sets. The Pan-STARRS r-band
filter is comparable to the r-band filter of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) (Gunn et al. 2006; Doi et al. 2010).
In Figure 1 we show the Pan-STARRS image of NGC
2974, as well as the resulting surface brightness model based
on Multiple Gaussian Expansion (MGE) fitting, see Section 3.1.1.

2.2

Stellar Kinematics

NGC 2974 was observed with the SAURON integral-field
unit on the William Herschel Telescope (Bacon et al. 2001),
as part of the SAURON survey (de Zeeuw et al. 2002).
The stellar kinematics (velocity, velocity dispersion and
Gaussian-Hermite moments h3, h4 were first presented by
Emsellem et al. (2004), while subsequently these observations were re-reduced as part of the Atlas3D Survey
(Cappellari et al. 2011). In this work, we use the kinematic

Cold Gas Kinematics

We use H i observations presented by Weijmans et al.
(2008). These observations were obtained by the Very Large
Array (VLA) in C-configuation, in September 2005. The
data were reduced and calibrated using the MIRIAD software package (Sault et al. 1995), resulting in a data cube
with spectral resolution 20 km/s and a spatial beam of
19.9 × 17.0 arcsec2 . For more details on the H i observations
and data reduction we refer to Weijmans et al. (2008). We
show the resulting H i velocity map of NGC 2974 in Figure 3:
note that the stellar and cold gas discs are kinematically
aligned.

Voronoi binned(Cappellari & Copin 2003) to a signal-tonoise of 40. More details on the extraction of the stellar
kinematic are given in Cappellari et al. (2011).

METHOD

In this section, we describe our method of constraining the
gravitational potential with the combination of two tracers: stars and cold gas. Stellar kinematics are modelled with
an orbit-superposition Schwarzschild model, while cold gas
kinematics are modelled as an ideal thin ring aligned with
the stellar disc. First, we define a gravitational potential
for our galaxy based on a choice of parameters (e.g., stellar
mass, dark matter profile). We then describe how we build a
stellar orbit library and construct a cold gas ring separately
from this potential. Finally, we use the combined weights
of stellar and cold gas kinematics to select our best-fitting
model.

where (x ′, y ′ ) are the two-dimensional coordinates aligned
along the major and minor axis of the surface brightness profile; S(x ′, y ′) is the surface brightness; Si (x ′, y ′ ) is the surface
brightness distribution of each Gaussian component with
corresponding amplitude Li , scale length σi and flattening

We apply MGE to the r-band Pan-STARRS image of
NGC 2974. The resulting MGE model contains 7 Gaussians
as shown in Table 2. The residuals are within 2% in the inner
region and about 10% in the outskirts of the galaxy.
To approximate the stellar mass also with an MGE
model, based on the surface brightness, we introduce a group
of free parameters Υ̃i ,

which is a function of a group of unknown parameters Υ̃i
and the MGE parameters of the surface brightness.
If Υ(x ′, y ′ ) = Υ0 is a constant in the galaxy, all the Υ̃i
have the same value of Υ0 . However, Υ(x ′, y ′ ) usually is not
a constant and we need to decide Υ̃i by fitting it. We choose
the SDSS r-band mass-to-light ratio distribution (Poci et al.
2017, Υ-maps available on Atlas3D website) as our Υ(x ′, y ′),
which is compatible with the Pan-STARRS r-band image
because of their comparable r-band filters. The resulting 1dimensional fit of Υ(x ′, y ′ ) is shown in Figure 4, and the
corresponding MGE central mass density Mi = Li · Υ̃i is
shown in Table 2. We notice that there is a dip in Υ at the
galaxy centre in Figure 4, which is caused by a single data

point. There is an AGN (Maia et al. 2003) in the centre of
NGC 2974, which could cause this dip. We therefore neglect
this single data point in the fitting of Υ(x ′, y ′ ).
The stellar mass and consequently Υ are affected by the
initial mass function (IMF): for example, a Chabrier IMF
(Chabrier 2003) produces almost 40% less stellar mass than
a Salpeter IMF (Salpeter 1955) with the same observables
(Santini et al. 2012). Here we introduce a factor α to indicate
the stellar mass variation caused by the choice of IMF as
a free parameter in our Schwarzschild modelling. Thus, the
stellar mass distribution used in the Schwarzschild modelling
becomes,
Õ

Si (x ′, y ′ ) · Υ̃i .
(4)
Mmod (x ′, y ′ ) = α · M(x ′, y ′ ) = α ·
i

The mass-to-light ratio distribution in Poci et al. (2017) is
obtained with the Salpeter IMF. We assume the galaxy has
a constant IMF, hence α is a constant as well. We rescale the
mass-to-light ratio such that the Chabrier IMF corresponds
to α = 1, and the Salpeter IMF corresponds to α = 1.7
(Speagle et al. 2014).
We deproject the 2-dimensional mass distribution to
3-dimensional mass density following Cappellari (2002);
van den Bosch et al. (2008), and introduce the intermediate
and minor axis ratio pi and qi . Since NGC 2974 is nearly
axisymmetric with pi ∼ 1, we adopt only one viewing angle, the inclination θ as a free parameter in our model, with
minor triaxiality still allowed.
As the total H i mass of NGC 2974 is three orders
smaller than the stellar mass (Weijmans et al. 2008), its
contribution to the gravitational potential is negligible and
therefore ignored in our model.
3.1.2

Dark Matter Mass

We adopt a spherical generalized NFW (gNFW) dark matter
halo (Navarro et al. 1996; Zhao 1996) with a density profile
of
ρs
ρr =
.

(r/rs )γ [1 + (r/rs )η ](3−γ)/η
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

Mapping the Dark Matter Halo of NGC 2974
This halo model has four free parameters: ρs is the scale
density, rs is the scale radius, γ is the inner slope, while η
controls the turning point. The outer slope of this profile
becomes −3 for r ≫ rs . When γ = 1 and η = 1, the gNFW
halo profile reduces to the NFW profile. For γ = 0, the halo
model has a core in its centre.
We avoid calculating the gravitational potential of the
gNFW profile analytically by expanding the halo density
profile to an MGE as well. As the halo is spherical, we use
the one-dimensional MGE expansion of Cappellari (2002).
We then generate the total gravitational potential from the
combined MGEs of stellar and dark matter halo density.
3.1.3

Black Hole

Based on the MBH − σ relation (e.g. Tremaine et al. 2002),
we expect a black hole mass of MBH = 2.5 × 108 M ⊙ for NGC
2974 (see also Krajnović et al. 2005), which gives a radius
of influence of just 0.2 arcsec. As this is below the spatial
resolution of the SAURON spectrograph (0.8 arcsec), we
at first neglected the contribution of the black hole to the
gravitational potential. However, we did find that without
the inclusion of the black hole, we could not reconstruct the
observed velocity dispersions of the central regions in our
models. We therefore decided to add the central black hole
to the potential regardless, and modelled it as a point source:

Here rsoft is the softening length of the black hole. We set
this length to rsoft = 10−3 pc.

an additional box orbit library dropped from the equipotential surface following the method in Zhu et al. (2018b),
using energy E and two spherical angles θ (inclination) and
φ (azimuthal angle). Energy E and inclination θ are sampled in the same way as the first library, while φ is linearly
sampled. The number of sample points nE × nθ × nφ for this
library also equals 21 × 10 × 7. We also smooth the model
by introducing 3 ditherings in E, θ and φ for each orbit and
create 5670 orbits in the box orbit library.
3.3

Model of Cold Gas Kinematics

We assume that the H i gas is dynamically cold, and hence
neglect its velocity dispersion. Since the typical H i velocity
dispersion in discs is less than 10 km/s, this is a reasonable
assumption for our case, where typical velocity errors are of
the same order.
We also assume that the H i gas forms an axisymmetric
thin ring aligned with the stellar disc in the equatorial plane
of the galaxy. This again is a reasonable assumption for NGC
2974, given that the velocity fields of the H i ring and the
stellar discs are aligned (see Figure 2 and 3). The H i gas
moves on circular orbits on the disc plane with a velocity of
r

Vc =

(7)

where Φ is the total gravitational potential, including stars,
dark matter halo and black hole. As shown, the H i velocity allows us to constrain the total gravitational potential
although it provides no constraints on the stellar orbit distribution.
The model light-of-sight velocity is given by
vmod = Vc sin θ cos φ,

3.2

Model of Stellar Kinematics

All orbits in a separable potential are analytical through
three conserved integrals of motion: E (energy), I2 and I3 .
There are four different types of orbits: three types of tube
orbits (short axis tubes, outer and inner long axis tubes)
and the box orbits. Even if I2 and I3 are not analytic, three
types of tubes orbits still exist, and most box orbits turn to
be boxlets.
We sample the initial conditions of the orbits with
their energy E and their starting point on the (x, z) plane
(van den Bosch et al. 2008). Each E is linked with a grid radius ri such that E equals the potential at position (x, y, z) =
(ri , 0, 0). We sample ri logarithmically. For each energy, we
then sample the starting point (x, z) from a linear open polar
grid (R, θ) in between the location of the thin orbits and the
equipotential of this energy. The number of sample points
across three dimensions nE × nθ × nR = 21 × 10 × 7. We introduce 3 ditherings in every dimension (E, θ and R) and create
an orbit bundle of 3 × 3 × 3 dithering orbits for each orbit in
our libraries to smooth the model, and this results in 5670
orbits in total. More details of the orbits sampling can be
found in van den Bosch et al. (2008).
This orbit library includes mostly short and long axis
tubes and hardly contains box orbits in the inner region. In
practice however, early-type galaxies are not perfectly axisymmetric and should contain a number of box orbits. To
generate enough box orbits for a triaxial shape, we also add

where φ is the azimuthal angle from the major axis and θ
is the inclination. To compare the model and observational
velocity directly, we need to convolve the model velocity
to take the beam smearing into account. We adopt a homogeneous H i mass distribution, therefore, we can directly
convolve the model velocity map with the beam.
3.4

Combining Kinematics Weights

Our method requires two different data sets: the stellar kinematics (including the zero moment or surface brightness, as
described by the MGE model), and the cold gas kinematics.
The total χ2 for each model built from the model parameters
therefore contains two terms:
2
2
χ2 = χstar
+ χgas
.

(9)

The best-fitting models are determined by selecting the
models with the minimum χ2 .
The stellar surface brightness and kinematics are reproduced simultaneously in a single Schwarzschild model by a
superposition of all orbit bundles. Each orbit bundle k has
a weight wk . The weights of these orbit bundles are solved

We apply our modelling technique to NGC 2974 as described
in Section 3. In total we generated 4, 259 dynamical models
of NGC 2974, and these models are selected in two different
ways: by including both the cold gas kinematics and stellar
kinematics, and by fitting the stellar kinematics only.
4.1

Parameter Grid

We have 5 free parameters in total: these are the IMF factor α, the three parameters of the dark matter halo profile
(ρs ,rs ,γ) and the black hole mass MBH . As Weijmans et al.
(2008) have already shown that the H i ring has an inclination of 60 ± 2°, we fix the inclination θ to 60°. The turning
point of the dark matter profile η is fixed to 2 in our model
because we find that η is not well constrained even with cold
gas kinematics.
The IMF factor α varies from 1.0 to 2.0 in steps of
0.1, to represent different IMFs. For the dark matter profile, the central density ρs and the scale radius rs are sampled on a logarithmic grid, log[ρs /(M ⊙ f · pc−3 )] ∈ [−5, 1] and
log(rs /pc) ∈ [3, 5]. The inner slope of the dark matter profile, γ ∈ [0, 1] is in a linear grid with a step of 0.1, and has
a minimum step of 0.05 around the best-fitting model. The
black hole mass MBH is sampled on a logarithmic grid, with
log(MBH /M ⊙ ) sampled on the interval [6, 10] in steps of 0.25.
We plot the parameter grids as 2D projections of the
parameter space shown in Figure 5 and 6. The dots rep-

resent all the models we have run, and the coloured dots
are the models within 3 − σ confidence level, where 1 − σ
2 − min( χ2 ) < ∆ χ2 , and
confidence levels are defined as χtot

χstar − min( χstar ) < ∆ χstar for the cases with and without gas,
respectively. It is obvious that cold gas constraints significantly lessen the models within 3 − σ confidence level and
reduce the uncertainties of the fitting, especially for parameters related to the dark matter profile ρs , rs and γ.
When including the cold gas kinematics in the fit, 48
of the 4, 259 models fall within the 1 − σ confidence interval, while this number increases to 1110 models if the cold
gas kinematics are omitted. This already demonstrates the
value of including the constraints of cold gas data, as the
parameters of the models get more tightly constrained.

4.2

Best-fitting Model

The best-fitting parameters for our model are shown in Table 3. The best-fitting parameters are the values of the bestfitting model identified as having the smallest χ2 , and the
uncertainties quoted as the lower and upper limits of all
models within the 1 − σ confidence level. We list both the
best-fitting parameter for the models with and without cold
gas constraints. The parameters of the dark matter profile
are better constrained by including the cold gas measurements, even though their actual values do not change significantly between the two different models.
α is around 1.8, and it produces a total stellar mass
6% more than the total mass produced by the Salpeter
IMF in Poci et al. (2017). We are however not able to infer the shape of IMF from α. The stellar Υ in r-band is
5.4M ⊙ /L ⊙ in the outskirts and rises up to 6.8M ⊙ /L ⊙ in the
centre. Cappellari et al. (2013b) measure a stellar Υ in rband of 8.9M ⊙ /L ⊙ with the assumption of a NFW halo,
which is significantly heavier than our measurements. However, when they assume a Salpeter IMF, their Υ within 1Re
is 6.1M ⊙ /L ⊙ , consistent with our measurements.
Krajnović et al. (2005) include a central black hole in
their Schwarzschild model of NGC 2974 with a fixed mass
as predicted by the MBH − σ relation (2.5 × 108 M ⊙ )(e.g.
Tremaine et al. 2002). Our best-fit models return a black
+1.2 × 109 M . However, as we stated before,
hole mass of 1.6−1.3
⊙
due to the spatial resolution of our data, as well as the not
well understood behaviour of Υ in the very central parts
of the galaxy, we do not make any claims about the true
mass of the supermassive black hole in NGC 2974 from our
models.
The corresponding best-fitting surface brightness and
kinematics maps for the model with cold gas constraints are
shown in Figure 7. The residual plots do not show strong
sub-structures.

4.3

Dark Matter Profile

Two parameters are commonly used to describe the dark
matter profile: the virial mass M200 , which is defined as
the enclosed mass within the virial radius r200 , where the
average density within r200 is 200 times the critical density (ρcrit = 1.37 × 10−7 M ⊙ /pc3 , adopting a Hubble constant
H0 = 70km/s/Mpc); and the concentration c, which is defined
as the ratio of the viral radius r200 and the scale radius rs .

all models within 1 − σ confidence level. Here ρs and MBH are already multiplied by α to obtain their actual values.

These parameters are listed in Table 3 for our best-fitting
models, which shows that the dark matter profile is better
constrained by including the cold gas kinematics in the fit.

4.3.1

Enclosed Mass Profile

The enclosed mass profiles of NGC 2974 are shown in Figure 8, both for the cases with and without cold gas constraints. The black, red and green solid lines stand for the

enclosed total, stellar and dark matter mass, respectively.
The corresponding dashed lines show the lower and upper
limits for the models within 1 − σ confidence level. The stellar mass profile changes little between the two plots, as it
dominates the inner region within 2Re and is mainly constrained by the stellar kinematic data. The dark matter
fraction is 7% within 1Re , consistent with the measurement
in Cappellari et al. (2013b) and smaller than the measurements of Weijmans et al. (2008) and Poci et al. (2017). The
dark matter fraction is 66% within 5Re with an uncertainty

of 10%. It is significantly better constrained with the cold
gas covering the region outside 4Re , where the dark matter
begins to be dominating. This emphasizes the importance of
extended tracers for dark matter measurements.

4.3.2

Dark Matter Inner Slope

We show the dark matter density profiles for the models
within 1− σ confidence level for both cases with and without
the cold gas constraints in Figure 9. It is apparent that the
dark matter profile is constrained much better by including
the cold gas kinematics. The inner slope γ of NGC 2974
seems to prefer a shallow cuspy profiles.
Figure 9 again highlights the significance of the cold gas
constraints. Including the cold gas kinematics in the model
significantly reduces the uncertainties of γ. As shown in the
right panel of this figure, with the stellar kinematics only
the 1 − σ uncertainties include the full parameter range for
γ, indicating we cannot constrain γ without the cold gas
kinematics.

4.4

Stellar Orbit Distribution

The stellar orbit distribution offers information on the
galaxy components and morphology, based on their model
kinematics. We characterize the stellar orbits with their circularity, defined as the ratio of circular motion and total
motion as:
λz = Lz /(rVc ),

(13)

p
where Lz = xvy − yvx , r =
x 2 + y 2 + z2 and Vc =
q
vx2 + vy2 + vz2 + 2vx vy + 2vx vz + 2vy vz , taken the average for
each orbit. Based on this parameter, we classify the orbits in
our model into three dynamical components: hot (λ < 0.25),
warm (0.25 < λ < 0.8), and cold (λ > 0.8). The circularity
map (Figure 10) shows that we can distinguish three major dynamical components in our dynamical model of NGC
2974: an extended hot component related to a prominent
bulge, a central warm component possibly representing a
thick disc, and an extended cold component linked to a thin
disc. This is consistent with NGC 2974 being a lenticular

the stellar orbit distribution in the best-fitting model. Compared to the axisymmetric orbit-superposition model made
by Krajnović et al. (2005), our method produces a strong
hot component instead of a strong counter-rotating component, because we allow a triaxial shape and sample enough
box orbits by adding an additional box library, while an axisymmetric model cannot generate box orbits at all.

DISCUSSION

One of our goals was to constrain the inner slope γ of the
gNFW dark matter profile of NGC 2974. A wide range of
values is quoted in literature for γ in early-type galaxies,
e.g. Wasserman et al. (2018) modelled the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 1407 and found an NFW-like inner slope
+0.2 , consistent with the average inner slope γ =

line is our rotation curve calculated from the gravitational potential and convolved with the SAURON PSF; the red and purple
solid lines are the stellar and dark matter contributions without
the PSF convolution; the corresponding dashed lines are their 1−σ
uncertainties. The error-bars are from Weijmans et al. (2008): the
green error-bars are the stellar velocity after asymmetric drift
correction and the orange error-bars are the H i velocity. The
difference at 1 kpc is because Weijmans et al. (2008) adopt an
analytical model based on asymmetric drift correction.

Weijmans et al. (2008) corrected observed stellar velocities of NGC 2974 for asymmetric drift, to obtain the circular velocity representative of the gravitational potential
of the galaxy. In Figure 11 we show a comparison between
their rotation curve, and the one we extracted from our
Schwarzschild models. The black solid and dashed lines are
the rotation curve and corresponding uncertainties generated from the gravitational potential of our Schwarzschild
models within the 1 − σ confidence level. The rotation curve
of Weijmans et al. (2008) has two parts: the orange dots
show the H i velocity data that we also used for our models;
the green dots are the stellar velocities corrected for asymmetric drift. Our model is therefore consistent with the earlier work by Weijmans et al. (2008).

SUMMARY

We introduced an orbit-based method with combined stellar
and cold gas kinematics and applied it to early-type galaxy
NGC 2974. The main results are as following.
(i) Our modelling shows a preference for a shallow cuspy
dark matter halo profile, with the inner slope of the halo
+0.2 in a gNFW profile. The dark matter halo has a
γ = 0.6−0.3
+6.3 × 1013 M and a concentration
total mass of M200 = 2.0−1.5
⊙
+3.2
of c = 10.8−1.5 . We also find that the stellar mass is slightly
heavier than the mass produced if we assume a Salpeter
IMF, with a corresponding stellar Υ in r-band decreasing
from 6.8M ⊙ /L ⊙ in the centre to 5.4M ⊙ /L ⊙ in the outskirts.
(ii) The comparison between the results of the
Schwarzschild modelling with and without cold gas
clearly shows that the cold gas kinematics are essential to
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

constrain the dark matter profile in galaxies. The cold gas
kinematics excluded more than 95% of models within the
1 − σ confidence level of the Schwarzschild modelling with
stellar kinematics only and reduced the relative uncertainty
of the dark matter fraction to 10% within 5Re . Adding the
cold gas constraints does an excellent job on obtaining the
inner slope γ of the dark halo profile.
(iii) We characterize the stellar orbits of NGC 2974 into
three principal components: an extended hot component, a
central warm component, and an extended cold component,
corresponding to a prominent bulge, a central thick disc or a
core, and a thin disc, respectively. As the cold gas kinematics
are outside the field-of-view of the stellar kinematic data, the
introduction of cold gas constraints does not alter the orbit
distribution significantly.
