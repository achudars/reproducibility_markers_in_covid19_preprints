Abstract
From experimental spark ignition (SI) engine studies, it is known that the
slow-down of early flame kernel development caused by the (Le > 1)-property
of common transportation-fuel/air mixtures tends to increase cycle-to-cycle
variations (CCV). To improve the fundamental understanding of the complex
phenomena inside the flame structure of developing flame kernels, an enginerelevant DNS database is investigated in this work. Conclusive analyses are
enabled by considering equivalent flame kernels and turbulent planar flames
computed with Le > 1 and Le = 1. In Part I of the present study (Falkenstein et al., Combust. Flame, 2019), a reduced representation of the local
mixture state was proposed for the purpose of this analysis. Fluctuations
in heat release rate attributed to differential diffusion were found to be governed by the parameters local enthalpy, local equivalence ratio, and H-radical

mass fraction. Here, a coupling relation for the diffusion-controlled mixture
parameter local enthalpy with local flame geometry and structure is derived,
characterized by the key parameters κ and |∇c| / |∇c|lam . The analysis shows
that the large positive global mean curvature intrinsic to the flame kernel configuration may detrimentally affect the local mixture state inside the reaction
zone, particularly during the initial flame kernel development phase. External energy supply by spark ignition may effectively bridge over this critical
stage, which causes the impact of global mean flame kernel curvature to be
small under the present conditions compared to the overall effect of Le 6= 1
observed in a statistically planar flame. Once ignition effects have decayed,
the mixture state inside the reaction zone locally exhibits an identical dependence on |∇c| as in a strained laminar flame. This implies that differential
diffusion effects at Karlovitz numbers representative for part-load conditions
are not weakened by small-scale turbulent mixing, which is undesirable for
the engine application, but can be favorable in terms of modeling.

1. Introduction
The reduction of cycle-to-cycle variations (CCV) in spark ignition (SI)
engines is a prerequisite for the design and control of engines with increased
efficiency [2, 3] and reduced emissions [4, 5]. From experiments it is wellknown that CCV are correlated with the duration of flame kernel development, which was found to be sensitive to stretch effects in Le 6= 1 mixtures [6].
The development of models that capture differential diffusion effects during

2

early flame kernel development requires a detailed understanding of the complex parameter interactions inside the unsteady flame structure, which can
be well-addressed by analysis of relevant DNS data. To this end, a DNS
database that was designed to be representative for SI engine part-load conditions is considered in this work. Systematic parameter variations were conducted that facilitate the isolation of effects related to the small flame kernel
size respective of the hydrodynamic length scales, as well as of differential
diffusion effects. The database consists of five different flame configurations,
which have been partly analyzed in previous studies as shown in Tab. 1. To
systematically approach the complexity of early flame kernel development,
the overall analysis has been divided into four parts by sequentially considering unity- and non-unity Lewis number flames, as well as macroscopic and
micro-scale effects. Run-to-run variations in the global heat release rate of
flame kernels computed in the Le = 1 limit were attributed to the effect of
flame front/turbulence interactions on flame surface area evolution [7]. In a
subsequent study, the investigation of Le = 1 flames with different D0 /lt (ratio of the initial flame diameter and the integral length scale of turbulence)
has shown that such variations in the total flame area are caused by stochastic variations in curvature variance due to large-scale turbulent flow motion
with characteristic length scales of at least the flame kernel size [8]. The
present study consists of two parts, where the Le > 1 datasets are analyzed
in detail. In the first part [1], the heat-release-rate response to differential
diffusion effects was analyzed based on the integrated chemical source term,
which has high practical relevance, and based on the local chemical source
term, which was used to identify the governing parameters in Le 6= 1 flames

in a quantitative fashion. In the present second part, the coupling between
the local mixture state, which determines the local heat release rate, and
the flame geometry and structure is established by pursuing a systematic
analytical approach, which will be introduced hereafter.
A reduced representation of the governing phenomena in premixed turbulent flames is provided in Fig. 1 based on c as a synonym for a reaction
progress variable, e.g. a (normalized) temperature or a quantity representative for the major product species. We begin the discussion of local effects
inside the flame structure that are related to differential diffusion by considering the impact of the local reaction progress variable source term ω̇c
(cf.

2

in Fig. 1), which is related to the local heat release rate. Heat release

induces a flame normal propagation velocity srn and causes flow dilatation,

4

which changes the orientation of the flame front with respect to the flow
field, thus affecting the tangential strain rate at . These quantities enter
the (|∇c|)-Eq., which additionally depends on flame curvature κ. The local
flame structure characterized by |∇c| in turn enters the (κ)-Eq. (through sd ),
which describes the evolution of local flame geometry. Obviously, the turbulent flow field plays a vital role in changing both |∇c| and κ, which is here
considered mainly as an external effect on the flame. For a discussion on
Lewis-number-dependent feedback from the flame on the surrounding flow
field, the reader is referred to the studies by Chakraborty et al. [9, 10]. The
effect of the local heat release rate on the evolution of flame structure [11]
and geometry [12] was investigated for different Lewis numbers, including
the correlation between κ and |∇c| [13]. Coupling in the opposite direction,
i.e. ω̇c -response to changes in flame structure and geometry (cf. Fig. 1) has
been mainly discussed in terms of the competition between focusing and defocusing of heat and reactants [14–16]. However, this simplified view based
on only two representative scalar fields may not be sufficient to explain all
phenomena in multi-species mixtures [17, 18]. Recently, Wang et al. [19] conducted a parametric study to assess the effect of nominal equivalence ratio on
heat release in high-Karlovitz H2 /air flames. Strong variations in heat release
were observed, which correlated with local temperature and local equivalence
ratio. The latter two quantities varied significantly across the reaction zone
due to differential diffusion effects, particularly under ultra-lean conditions.
A reaction pathway analysis revealed the influence of changed radical availability and reaction rate constants on local heat release. It should be noted
that at very high Karlovitz numbers, molecular diffusion is overshadowed by

5

small-scale turbulent mixing [20], which relaxes the local equivalence ratio
(and enthalpy) towards the nominal values of the unburned mixture, i.e. both
quantities may vary less in flames located in the distributed burning regime
than in laminar flames [21, 22]. However, even at high-Karlovitz conditions,
differential diffusion was found to be important during turbulent flame development [23, 24].
Under conventional SI engine part-load conditions, Karlovitz numbers are
actually closer to unity and differential diffusion effects substantially reduce
the global heat release rate during early flame kernel development, as shown
in Part I of the present study [1]. A comparative macroscopic analysis following the ( ω̇c )-Eq. in Fig. 1 attributed the detrimental impact of differential
diffusion to the flame normal propagation velocity. A subsequent micro-scale
analysis identified the governing parameters that capture the effect of turbulence on the local reaction progress variable source term ω̇c . Specifically, the
local mixture state that determines ω̇c was shown to be well-represented by
the local equivalence ratio φ, enthalpy h, and the H-radical mass fraction YH .
In the present manuscript, the coupling term between the mixture state
parameters and the local flame structure and geometry is exemplarily derived for the enthalpy equation in Sect. 3. The analysis presented in Sect. 4
demonstrates how the flame-kernel-intrinsic global mean curvature alters the
local mixture state and heat release rate. Further, the effect of turbulence
on the flame structure is shown by relating the behavior of flame kernels to
strained laminar flames.

and κ is much weaker than in flames with Lek 6= 1. Note that turbulent fluctuations in the scalar fields ahead of the flame

In the limit of Lek = 1, φ and h remain almost constant across the flame structure, i.e. the coupling between ω̇c and |∇c|

2. Summary of the DNS Database
Since the DNS database and solution methods for laminar flames have
been described in Part I of the present study [1], only a brief summary of
the datasets is provided hereafter. In this work, four different flame configurations (kernel/planar, Le = 1/Le > 1) are considered (cf. Tab. 1). The
main reference case is a flame kernel developing in homogeneous isotropic turbulence with fully homogeneous, stoichiometric iso-octane/air mixture and
Le > 1. An equivalent dataset has been generated for a statistically planar flame. Additionally, both flame configurations computed in the Le = 1
limit [7, 8] are available for this study. The flame conditions and nondimensional groups are listed in Tabs. 2 and 3, respectively. In Tab. 2, the
mixture thermodynamic state is given by the pressure p(0) and temperature
of the unburned gas Tu with equivalence ratio φu . Note that the turbulent
flow field corresponds to decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence, which
explains the DNS parameter ranges given in Tab. 3. The turbulent integral length scale and eddy turnover time are denoted by lt and τt , η is the
Kolmogorov length scale, while the laminar flame thickness and initial flame
diameter are referred to as lf and D0 , respectively.
A brief summary of the DNS setup is given in Tab 4. One important
difference between the flame kernel datasets and the planar reference flames is
the initialization method. Flame kernels were ignited by a source term in the
temperature equation, which results in an early growth phase comparable to
engine experiments reported in literature as shown in our previous study [8].
By contrast, a laminar unstretched flame was imposed into the turbulent flow
field as initial condition for the planar-flame DNS to avoid strong dilatation

3. Mathematical Formulation: Differential Diffusion Effects in the
Enthalpy Equation
Specifically in stretched flames, differential-diffusion induces variations in
element mass fractions (i.e. local equivalence ratio) [37, 38], enthalpy [39]
and radical mass fractions [17, 40, 41] across the flame structure. Consequently, changes in chemical reaction rates and pathways may occur in
presence of strong stretch [19]. In Part I of the present study [1], the combination of (φ, h, YH ) was identified as the most suitable parameter set to
capture differential-diffusion-induced variations in heat release rate conditioned on the reaction progress variable, in agreement with existing litera10

homogeneous, i.e. variations in local enthalpy or equivalence ratio develop
inside the flame structure (with the exception of the initial spark ignition
in case of flame kernels). Hence, the occurrence of inhomogeneous enthalpy
and equivalence ratio is mainly a diffusion-driven flame response to external
changes in flame structure and geometry. In the following, the mathematical
parameter relationship will be derived for the enthalpy in the planar flame
dataset. Similarly, one could consider transport equations for the element
mass fractions as shown by van Oijen and de Goey for a premixed counterflow configuration [42], which is not pursued here for brevity. While enthalpy
was not numerically solved for in the present DNS, a formula consistent with
the employed transport model will be derived. We begin with the balance
equation for an enthalpy variable h defined as the sum of the sensible and
chemical enthalpies [43], here simplified for low-Mach-number flows:

The first term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (6) corresponds to molecular diffusion of
enthalpy and is denoted as Dh . Note that Dh is independent of nonequal
transport properties among different species. Differential diffusion may introduce local variations in enthalpy through DLe , which vanishes in unityLewis-number mixtures. As will be shown below, the remaining three terms
are comparatively less important in the present flame configurations, but do
not cancel out in the limit of mass equidiffusion in an initially gradient-free
enthalpy field. The term DW corresponds to diffusion due to spatial variations in molecular weight and DT represents thermodiffusion. Since the
applied diffusion model requires a correction term to enforce mass conserva15

tion, the associated enthalpy transport appears as Dmc in Eq. (6). All terms
have been evaluated in the planar DNS dataset with Lek 6= 1. The results
shown in Fig. 2 confirm that the differential diffusion term DLe is of leading
order. It is balanced by molecular diffusion of enthalpy through Dh . In order
to further investigate the role of differential diffusion in the present turbulent flames, we seek to identify the governing flame parameters which are
suitable for conditional averaging of the DNS results and enable a rigorous
comparison to laminar reference solutions.
After splitting the species mass diffusion terms into components by normaland tangential diffusion [44], the differential diffusion term DLe in Eq. (6) can
be rewritten in terms of the scalar-iso-surface curvature κ(Yk ) and the scalar-

To parameterize differential diffusion under the present engine-relevant DNS
conditions, the turbulent scalar field shall be related to the laminar unstretched flame in points where |∇Yk |lam > 0. Further, we assume that

i.e. scalar iso-surfaces are considered to be parallel at a given temperature and
scalar gradients inside the flame structure are proportionally compressed or
expanded if the local flame thickness deviates from the unstretched premixed
flame. Note that a very similar assumption as the latter was previously used
by Lapointe and Blanquart [45] to derive an approximate expression for the
17

turbulent burning velocity (cf. Eq. (A.4) therein). It should be noted that in
presence of strong turbulent micro-mixing, the applied analogy to a laminar
reference flame is not expected to hold. Introducing these assumptions into
Eq. (7) yields the approximate differential diffusion term for enthalpy shown

As will be shown below, using κ as a measure for local flame geometry and
|∇ϑ| / |∇ϑ|lam for a representative scalar ϑ to characterize changes in flame
structure with respect to a laminar reference flame works reasonably well
to parameterize differential diffusion under the present engine-relevant DNS
conditions. Obvious choices for ϑ include a reaction progress variable or
the temperature. Here, the temperature is selected for better comparability
with existing literature, since it is commonly used as independent variable in
non-unity-Lewis-number flames. However, this choice does not restrict the
conclusions to this particular progress variable definition.
It should be mentioned that assumptions (10) and (11) are in fact more
restrictive than common flamelet assumptions, which is due to the simplicity of the present analytical approach. Here, we seek to link the evolution
of the mixture state parameter h to only one laminar reference flame solution, as opposed to a mapping of the full mixture state vector of multiple
flamelet solutions to the turbulent flame based on the local flow conditions.
While Eq. (10) is analogous to neglecting species gradients in ϑ iso-surface18

tangential directions (∂/∂ϑk << ∂/∂ϑ for k = 2, 3 [46]), the assumption is
here introduced for the entire flame structure, i.e. not limited to the reaction
zone. This is necessary in order to correctly represent differential diffusion
effects inside the preheat region, which may significantly affect the enthalpy
distribution in the reaction zone. In a suitable flamelet formulation [46], the
species solution in composition space can adjust to the local curvature of
the respective ϑ iso-surface, and may yield a modeled species field in physical space that violates assumption (10). Similarly, the species solution of
a laminar flamelet may respond to changes in scalar dissipation rate such
that assumption (11) is not satisfied by a modeled species field. However, it
should be noted that the coupling between the local mixture state (e.g. h)
and the local flame structure (|∇ϑ| / |∇ϑ|lam ) and geometry (κ) here derived
from the separate consideration of molecular diffusion processes in flame normal and tangential directions in physical space [47] can be analyzed in the
same way by considering the enthalpy equation in composition space. Savard
and Blanquart [46] have shown that a premixed flamelet formulation that additionally accounts for the local normal diffusion rate of the representative
scalar ϑ remains valid up to moderate reaction zone Karlovitz numbers of
Kaδ < 10, which supports the present assumptions. For a discussion on
the differences between a parameterization of the local heat release rate by
the diffusion rate, as opposed to |∇ϑ| and κ, refer to Part I of the present
study [1]. Compared to previous work on premixed flamelet equations that
contain the parameters |∇ϑ| [46] or strain [48], and κ, the present analytical
approach pursues a fine-grained, illustrating backward analysis of the governing parameter interactions from the local heat release rate to the external

19

effect of turbulence.
To demonstrate that the assumptions (10) and (11) hold on average under
the present conditions, both parameters have been evaluated from different
species and based on temperature. Conditional mean results are plotted as
function of the temperature-based quantities in Fig. 3. Note that the data
has been conditioned on non-zero scalar gradients to avoid singularities, but
not on specific temperature iso-levels. The strong correlation between flame
curvatures computed from different quantities (cf. Fig. 3 (a)) confirms the
assumption that scalar iso-surfaces in the same spatial location are mostly
parallel to each other. Similarly, the correlation between scalar-gradient
ratios is shown in Fig. 3 (b). The respective laminar reference gradient is
mapped based on the local temperature value. Although the correlation with
the temperature-based parameter is less strong compared to the curvature
results, the conditional mean gradient ratios evaluated for different species
scatter around the diagonal, which is sufficient for the present analysis. Recall
that the same laminar unstreteched premixed flame is used as reference flame
in all points, i.e. the shown correlations are expected to improve if a higher
dimensional reference flamelet manifold is used.
In this section, the mathematical relation between the local mixture state
(which determines ω̇c ) and flame structure and geometry has been derived.
Eq. (12) suggests the following hypothesis for turbulent premixed flames with
Karlovitz numbers not much higher than unity: differential diffusion effects
approach the limit of a laminar unstretched flame, if the curvature is zero and
the local temperature gradient is comparable to the laminar reference flame.
This hypothesis and the actual quantitative effects of differential diffusion in

4. Results
Since differential diffusion introduces a strong coupling between the local
mixture state and the flame geometry and structure (cf. (DLe )-Eq. in Fig. 1),
the particular conditions during early flame kernel development require special attention. In Sect. 4.1, differences between the flame kernel and the
planar flame configuration that can be attributed to curvature effects will
be investigated. The role of turbulence in changing the flame structure will
be analyzed in Sect. 4.2 by relating the behavior of flame kernels to laminar
flame solutions. Finally, the role of hydrodynamic strain will be discussed in

4.1. Combined Effect of Flame Geometry and Structure
In Part I of this study [1] it was shown that the mean heat release rate
conditioned on the reaction progress variable (temperature) is significantly
reduced by differential diffusion effects in the present flames with Le > 1.
Further, the local mixture state at a given progress variable was shown to
be well-represented by the reduced parameter set (h, φ, YH ). Here, the difference between the flame kernel configuration that features positive global
mean curvature due to the quasi-spherical flame shape and the planar flame
configuration will be analyzed. To this end, the evolution of the governing
parameters inside the flame structure of flame kernels will be considered in
a first step.
In Fig. 4, the overall impact of differential diffusion is shown by the results
extracted from the fully-developed planar flames computed with Le > 1 and
Le = 1. In addition, results for flame kernels with Le > 1 are shown. For
a spherical expanding flame with Le > 1 and substantial mean curvature,
one would expect a stronger reduction in heat release rate with respect to
the laminar unstretched limit than in case of a statistically planar flame,
which is confirmed by the flame kernel results extracted at t = 1.92 τt (cf.
Fig. 4 (a)). At this time instant, compared to the corresponding planar flame
dataset, the mixture state inside the reaction zone (indicated by the two
vertical lines) is characterized by reduced levels of both h and φ, as well as
a lower peak H-radical fraction. During the very early phase of flame kernel
development, the detrimental effect of differential diffusion on the heat release
rate is effectively compensated by spark ignition, which leads to an increased
enthalpy level inside the flame structure (cf. Fig. 4 (b)). Additional results

for curvature, temperature gradient magnitude, and tangential strain rate
across the flame structure that show the effect of high global mean curvature
and spark ignition during early flame kernel development are provided in
Fig. S-1 of the supplementary material.
Since mean flame curvature is an intrinsic property of the flame kernel
configuration, we will now focus on the flame response to local curvature,
and use the findings to estimate the effect of global mean flame curvature
on the heat release rate of flame kernels afterwards. According to Eq. (12),

23

differential-diffusion-induced variations in enthalpy across the flame structure
depend on both the local curvature and a representative scalar gradient.
Although κ is not explicitly contained in the second term in the r.h.s. of
Eq. (12), the occurrence of curvature will typically alter both terms due to
the coupling between κ and |∇c| in premixed flames (cf. (κ)- and (|∇c|)-Eqs.
in Fig. 1), which can be partly attributed to the negative correlation between
the tangential strain rate and curvature [26], as shown in Fig. S-2 of the
supplementary material for the present datasets. To assess the development
of the flame structure of the expanding flame kernels after spark ignition,
the mean temperature gradient conditioned on curvature has been evaluated
for the temperature iso-surface corresponding to the maximum heat release
rate in an unstretched premixed flame (‘TmaxHR ’). The correlations shown in
Fig. 5 (a) are overall very consistent with the Le > 1 results by Chakraborty
and Cant [13]. For positive curvatures, all flames exhibit a monotonously
decreasing trend. Hence, flame kernels that feature mean positive curvature
as shown by the curvature PDFs in Fig. 5 (b) will on average have lower
temperature gradients compared to the planar flame. With respect to the
spark effect it can be concluded that the initially high gradients observed in
Fig. 5 (a) decay until t = 0.91 τt on the entire TmaxHR -iso-surface under the
present conditions. It should be noted that in the limit of zero local curvature,
the temperature gradient of the turbulent flames is reduced compared to an
unstretched laminar flame. This effect will be attributed to hydrodynamic
strain later on. Keeping the negative correlation between |∇T | and κ in mind,
the combined effect of externally invoked changes in flame geometry (κ) and
structure (|∇T |) on the local mixture state (h, φ, YH ) and heat release rate

will be analyzed in the next section.
Results for the fully developed planar flames are depicted in Fig. 6. While
the curvature-conditioned mean heat release rates shown in Fig. 6 (a) recover
similar levels as the corresponding laminar unstretched flames in regions
with strong negative curvature (κ < −1/lf ), differential diffusion leads to a
pronounced negative correlation between curvature and the chemical source
term in flame regions with moderately negative as well as positive curvature.
This characteristic behavior of Le > 1 flames has very strong negative consequences for the heat release rate of flame kernels with positive global mean
curvature, which will be quantified below. Note that in the planar turbulent
flame with Le > 1, even flame regions with zero curvature exhibit detrimental behavior in terms of the desirable high burning rate for engine applications. This reduction in heat release rate compared to a laminar unstretched
flame is due to the presence of hydrodynamic strain, which is indicated in
Fig. 6 (a) by the laminar data point extracted from a back-to-back counter25

flow flame (c.f.f.) solution. The strained laminar flame solution has been selected based on the condition |∇T |maxHR,cff = h|∇T | | (T = TmaxHR , κ = 0)i
and will be analyzed in more detail in Sect. 4.2 (also refer to Fig. S-3 in
the supp. material). In both the laminar strained as well as the turbulent
flame, the reduction in heat release rate can be explained by the differentialdiffusion-induced decrease in enthalpy and equivalence ratio compared to the
laminar unstretched limit (cf. Fig. 6 (b)), i.e. by the second term in Eq. (12).
Recall that the transport equations of both quantities do not have a chemical source term (cf. Eq. (6)), but there is a coupling with the heat release
rate through the (|∇T |)-Eq. as shown in Fig. 1. The reduction in YH shown
in Fig. 6 (b) is another causal effect for lowering the heat release rate at
the considered iso-temperature level TmaxHR . However, the quantitative relation between ω̇T | T and the parameters (h, φ, YH ), which were found to
well-parametrize the heat release rate across the entire flame structure (cf.
Part I [1]), shows that the influence of the H-radical mass fraction is much
lower than that of h and φ (cf. Fig. S-4 of the supp. material). With respect
to the curvature PDFs plotted in Fig. 6 (PDFΣ|T : surface-weighted PDF,
conditioned on T = TmaxHR ), differential diffusion is shown to cause a distribution with shorter tails in the engine-relevant, Le > 1 case, consistent with
the analysis by Alqallaf et al. [12]. Between the 10th and 90th percentile of the
Le > 1 curvature distribution, the normalized enthalpy and local equivalence
ratio vary in the ranges h/hlam = 0.97...0.63 and φ = 1.05...0.81, which are
strong deviations from the Le = 1 limit with h/hlam ≈ 1 and φ ≈ 1. Since the
key difference between the considered planar flames and the engine-relevant
flame kernel configuration is the curvature distribution (cf. Fig. 5), the effect

on the mean heat release rate will be estimated in the following.
The curvature distribution of flame kernels exhibits positive mean curvature, which is expected to reduce the mean heat release rate due to differential
diffusion effects (cf. Fig. 6 (a)). Further, the very early phase of flame kernel development is characterized by the occurrence of skewness towards high
positive curvature, which has been previously shown in the Le = 1 limit [8]
and is confirmed in Fig. S-5 of the supplementary material for the present
Le > 1 datasets. To investigate the impact of the curvature distribution, we
have convoluted the curvature-conditioned mean heat release rate of the fully
developed planar flame that was shown in Fig. 6 (a) with three different curvature distributions: i) the actual curvature PDF of the Le > 1 flame kernel
configuration (four realizations), ii) the time-varying curvature PDF of the
planar flame (to assess the effect of the kernel’s mean positive curvature),
and iii) an artificial curvature PDF generated from the PDF of the planar
flame, but shifted to the same mean curvature as the flame kernel and renor27

malized (to test the effect of positve curvature skewness). This procedure has
been repeated for a sequence of time instances during early flame development, while keeping the conditional mean heat release rate constant. Hence,
the effect of mean curvature intrinsic to the flame kernel configuration on
the mean heat release rate can be separated from differences in curvature
PDF shape and spark effects. Additionally, this approach may be a first
estimate for the performance of an ideal model that approximates the global
heat release rate of flame kernels based on the mean flame kernel curvature
and statistics of a fully developed planar flame, which is further investigated
in Appendix A. The mean heat release rates resulting from the convolution
on the TmaxHR -iso-surface are shown in Fig. 7 as function of time. According
to this estimate, mean curvature may have a significant effect on the mean
heat release rate during the very early phase of flame kernel development.
However, it was shown in Fig. 4 (a) that spark ignition initially leads to a
higher heat release rate than in the planar flame, which is not accounted
for in Fig. 7. This means that the initially strong detrimental effect of differential diffusion induced by high positive mean curvature of flame kernels
(cf. Fig. 7) is effectively compensated by external enthalpy supply under the
present conditions. After a time of t ≈ 0.5 τt is reached, the reduction compared to the developing planar flame amounts to approximately 10 %. Since
the same applies for the planar-shifted PDF convolution, this reduction is
only the effect of mean curvature of the kernel and the positive curvature
skewness has only a minor effect. Also note that after t ≈ 0.5 τt , the relative
difference in mean heat release rate between the flame kernel and the planar flame estimated in Fig. 7 and observed at TmaxHR in Fig. 4 (a) are very

similar, which supports the validity of the preceding analysis.
Hence, it can be concluded that compared to the overall effect of differential diffusion reflected by the difference between the Le > 1/Le = 1 planarflame results in Fig. 4 (a), the additional reduction in mean heat release rate
due to to positive mean curvature of flame kernels is rather small, thanks to
initial ignition energy supply. It should also be noted that the minor influence
of the PDF-shape on the mean heat release rate does not imply that characteristic kernel/turbulence interactions are per se irrelevant for flame kernel
development. In fact, the skewness of the curvature distribution might be an
indicator for extinction tendency in the broken kernel regime [49–51], which
is a topic suggested for future work.
4.2. Dependence of (h, φ, YH ) on Local Variations in Flame Structure for a
given Curvature
According to Fig. 1, the local heat release rate is determined by the local
mixture state, characterized by the parameter set (c, h, φ, YH ). For Lek 6= 1,
29

h has been shown to be coupled to the local flame structure (|∇c|) and
geometry (κ) through the (DLe )-term in the enthalpy transport equation (cf.
Eq. (12)). While the role of flame curvature has been already discussed in
Sect. 4.1, the objective here is to quantify the effect of externally invoked
changes in |∇c| due to hydrodynamic strain (cf. (|∇c|)-Eq. in Fig. 1). In the
limit of κ = 0, this analysis can be consistently applied to turbulent flames
and the laminar counterflow flame (c.f.f.) configuration, which has been
already used as a reference solution in Fig. 6. In the following sections, we
will first show how the planar flame compares to the laminar counterflow
configuration and relate flame kernel development to the fully developed
planar results afterwards. For clarity, the analysis will be limited to the
TmaxHR -iso-surfaces.
In Fig. 8, the flame structure of both turbulent and laminar flames is parameterized by |∇T |, which is analogous to employing the scalar dissipation
rate χT for modeling purposes [52]. It is shown that in the fully developed
planar flame with Le > 1, local regions with zero curvature on average exhibit ω̇T and (h, φ, YH ) dependencies on |∇T | that are almost identical to the
laminar premixed counterflow configuration. If differential diffusion effects
were significantly reduced by small-scale turbulent mixing, the slope of the
conditional means would approach the plotted Le = 1 results [22, 46, 53].
This is an important finding since the Karlovitz numbers in the present
datasets are located in the upper range of conventional SI engine part-load
conditions. Note that the behavior of an unstretched laminar flame is locally
recovered for |∇T | = |∇T |lam , which confirms the chosen parametrization
derived from the (DLe )-Eq. The unconditional mean value plotted as open

30

square symbol at |∇T | / |∇T |lam ≈ 0.7 in each subfigure marks the unfavorable conditions found on average near TmaxHR -iso-surface elements with
κ = 0 (also cf. Fig. 6). As a remark to the shown correlations for a constant
iso-temperature, it should be mentioned that each quantity may respond to
strain by changes in the overall magnitude, or by qualitatively changing its
distribution across the flame structure towards lower/higher temperatures
(cf. Fig. S-3 in the supp. material).
Regarding the conditional |∇T |-PDFs (PDFΣ|T, κ : surface-weighted PDF,
conditioned on T = TmaxHR and κ = 0) shown in Fig. 8, large variance can be
observed in the Le > 1 flame, besides the significantly reduced mean value
compared to the Le = 1 dataset. The large variance can be explained by
the strong coupling between flame structure and geometry with the local
mixture state by differential diffusion as sketched in Fig. 1. Any change in
scalar gradients may trigger changes in enthalpy and local equivalence ratio
(cf. (DLe )-Eq.), which cause direct response in heat release rate. Since scalar
gradient production depends on dilatation through the tangential strain term
(cf. (|∇c|)-Eq.), a wider gradient distribution can be expected in Le 6= 1
flames. In the Le = 1 limit, external changes in |∇T | or κ trigger only minor
variations in the local mixture state due to the Soret effect since the (DLe )-Eq.
vanishes.
Now that relationships between the canonical configuration of a fully developed turbulent planar flame and strained laminar flame characteristics
have been established, we seek to connect early flame kernel development to
the planar-flame results. Recall that in contrast to the afore-discussed planar
flames, flame kernels were ignited with a volumetric heat source of spherical

shape, which provides excess enthalpy (cf. Fig. 4 (b)) and high scalar gradients (cf. Fig. 5). In Fig. 9, the mean heat release rate and mixture state
parameters conditioned on |∇T | are shown for three different time instances
of flame kernel development. As before, the data has been conditioned on
(TmaxHR )-iso-surface elements. Here, the data has been conditioned on the
respective flame-averaged curvature hκi, i.e. for the planar flame the same
data as in Fig. 8 is shown due to hκi = 0. First, we focus on the development of the flame structure in time. The results in Fig. 9 suggest that
on average, the dependence of the heat release rate and the H-radical mass
fraction on |∇T | barely changes over time. This can be explained by the coupling between the heat release rate and the evolution of scalar gradients (cf.
(|∇c|)-Eq. in Fig. 1), and by the fact that YH contains the chemical response
to changes in the local mixture state. By contrast, the diffusion-controlled
parameters enthalpy and local equivalence ratio that do not have a chemical
source term in their transport equation exhibit strong deviations during the
early kernel development phase. Spark ignition initially supplies the flame
structure with excess enthalpy leading to high heat release (cf. open circle
in Fig. 9 (a)) and produces large gradients, as indicated by the |∇T |-PDF
at t = 0.37 τt . The initial deviation of the local equivalence ratio from the
planar flame results (cf. Fig. 9 (c)) is likely due to the development of the
characteristic species distribution inside the highly curved flame structure
in presence of large temperature gradients generated by spark ignition. At
t = 0.91 τt , the correlations with |∇T | are overall fairly similar to the developed planar flame. However, the gradient distribution indicates generally
reduced gradients, which is due to the presence of mean flame curvature (cf.

33

Fig. 5). At t = 1.92 τt , a tendency towards the gradient distribution of the
developed flame can be observed, but still with significantly higher probability of low gradients. In summary, the Le > 1 flame kernels approach very
similar conditional dependencies as the planar turbulent and strained laminar flames, after the initial non-equilibrium correlation between κ and |∇T |
imposed by spark ignition has decayed within less than two laminar flame
times. Differences between the iso-surface averaged quantities in the flame
kernel and the planar flame configuration can be attributed to the overall
larger flame thickness caused by the positive mean flame kernel curvature.
4.3. The Role of Hydrodynamic Strain in the Limit of Zero Curvature
The preceding analyses were focussed on the coupling between flameinternal parameters, i.e. quantities that respond to changes in heat release
rate either due to a non-negligible chemical source term in their transport
equation (e.g. (|∇c|)-Eq.) [26, 54], or due to a strong heat-release-rate dependence of at least one of their key parameters (cf. (DLe )-Eq.). Here, the flameexternal effect of turbulence on the coupled convection/reaction/diffusion
system will be discussed. Specifically, the tangential strain rate in the (|∇c|)-Eq.
will be considered as a major entry point of hydrodynamic strain into the
flame structure. For the sake of generality, the limit of zero curvature will be
investigated in the planar flame datasets, which is consistent with the results
presented in Fig. 8 and enables a phenomenological comparison to strained
counterflow flames. It should be noted that in such canonical, steady flame
configurations, the mass flux variation through the flame is proportional to
the tangential strain rate [26, 42]. However, it was found that even in steady
flames, the parameterization of the burning velocity in terms of the strain

rate is non-unique, i.e. differs in back-to-back as opposed to fresh-to-burned
counterflow flames [55, 56], at least for high strain rates. In turbulent flames,
some correlation between the local heat release rate and the tangential strain
rate was observed in unity-Lewis-number flames [57, 58]. By contrast, DNS
results for flames with Lewis numbers significantly different from unity indicate only a very weak correlation [1, 46], in particular at high Karlovitz
numbers [53]. However, the role of strain has been mainly discussed based
on flame data extracted at one or multiple fixed instants of time in a Eulerian reference frame. In this section, results will be provided that suggest
to investigate the local impact of strain at given flame particle locations by
means of time series analyses in a flame-attached reference frame, particularly in highly unsteady flames with Le 6= 1. The following considerations
are motivated by the significant global net effect of hydrodynamic strain on
the flame structure in the present Le > 1 dataset that was shown by the low
averaged heat release rate at κ = 0 in Fig. 6 (a).
We begin the forward analysis of turbulence effects on the flame structure
from the tangential strain rate at in Fig. 1. In absence of a heat-release-rate
response to strain that would alter the displacement speed, and in the considered limit of κ = 0, the (|∇c|)-Eq. suggests net production of |∇c| by extensive (positive) tangential strain. This is demonstrated in Fig. 10 (a) by a
strong positive correlation between |∇T | and at for the Le = 1 dataset, which
was shown to exhibit only small fluctuations in the local heat release rate [1].
Note that the temperature iso-surface corresponding to the maximum temperature gradient magnitude in the laminar unstretched premixed flame was
chosen for evaluation, since the slope of |∇T | in temperature space is rather

36

small at this iso-temperature, which should reduce the scatter due to possible
shifts (in temperature space) of the local flame profiles. For Le > 1, |∇T |
is seemingly independent of at as shown in Fig. 10 (c). This very different
behavior compared to the Le = 1 dataset is not surprising, since the initial
assumption of a small heat-release-rate response to strain does not hold for
the Le > 1 flame. Note that the flame-external effect of strain is very similar in both flames, which is shown by the marginal strain PDFs provided
in Fig. S-6 in the supplementary material. In order to investigate the effect
of heat release on the strain dependence of |∇T |, the joint-PDFs evaluated
for the iso-temperatures corresponding to the maximum heat release rate in
the respective laminar unstretched flames are shown in Fig. 10 (b,d). The
comparison of both datasets indicates that in the Le > 1 flame, production
of |∇T | by positive hydrodynamic strain is overshadowed by the secondary
effect of heat release-rate-response to strain, which leads to a weak negative
correlation between |∇T | and at . This hypothesis will be analyzed in more
detail hereafter by considering the correlation between the local heat release
rate and strain. In Part I of the present study [1], an optimal estimator analysis has shown that in the Le = 1 limit, the parameterization of the local
heat release rate with the external effect of at for a given temperature and
flame curvature is as well-suited as using the flame-internal parameter YH at
a given temperature. For Le > 1, the flame-external parameter at (in combination with (T, κ)) results in a substantially higher irreducible error than
any of the tested flame-internal parameters. In the present limit of κ = 0,
T = TmaxHR,lam , the correlation between ω̇T and at is indeed weak for Le > 1,
but obviously negative as shown in Fig. 11 (b). This is consistent with re-

sults from a thermo-diffusively stable H2 /air flame by Chen and Im [40],
which were extracted from flame regions with negligible curvature. Phenomenologically, the negative correlation between ω̇T and at will feed back
into the (|∇c|)-Eq. leading to a closed-loop system characterized by multiple
timescale ratios, such as the strain Karlovitz number Kas = tf · at [25], and
diffusive Damköhler numbers for the governing parameters (e.g. (h, φ, YH )),
which could be based on a scalar dissipation rate [59], or a relevant diffusion
term [60]. Finally, it should be noted that the minor variation in ω̇T shown in
Fig. 11 (a) confirms the initial assumption of small heat-release-rate response
for the Le = 1 flame.
To summarize, the cause-effect loop inside the flame structure (cf. Fig. 1)
of a turbulent planar flame with Le > 1 has been discussed in terms of the
tangential strain rate, which is here considered as an external effect. Any
change in local strain is expected to propagate through the coupled system
of governing flame parameters, which all change based on their own characteristic time scales. It is believed that the weak correlation between the
heat release rate and the tangential strain rate in Le 6= 1 flames is a result
of this rather loose coupling, which will require deeper analyses to allow for
quantitative conclusions. A possible starting point is a flame particle analysis [59, 61] that provides access to the time histories of the flame parameter
balance equation terms along flame particle trajectories, which is a topic
suggested for future work.

Conclusions
Since experimental SI engine studies have provided evidence that differential diffusion effects in fuel/air mixtures with Le > 1 lead to an increase in
CCV, it is desirable to assess the impact already during engine design. To
enable the development of models that capture such fuel effects on CCV, the
intention of the present work is to improve the understanding of the complex
phenomena inside the flame structure during early flame kernel development.
To this end, a DNS database designed to be representative for engine partload conditions has been analyzed in detail according to a suitable expression
for the coupling between the local mixture state and the flame geometry and
structure. Flame kernel results have been related to canonical turbulent and
laminar flame configurations to enhance generality and increase the relevance
of the present findings for future modeling efforts. Specifically, the following

40

conclusions can be drawn:
– The key mathematical expression that characterizes differential diffusion effects under the present engine-relevant (part-load) conditions is
Eq. (12). If non-zero, this term leads to a two-way coupling between the
local heat release rate and the flame geometry expressed by curvature,
and flame structure expressed by a scalar gradient magnitude. In the
limit of Le = 1, the local mixture state is barely affected by flame geometry and structure since DLe = 0, i.e. there is mainly a one-way coupling
from the heat release rate to scalar gradients and curvature (also refer
to Part I [1]). The substantially larger number of involved diffusive
and hydrodynamic time and length scales may explain the excessive
variance in heat release rate associated with the two-way-coupled system [1]. Further, the (DLe )-Eq. suggests two flame parameters for the
analysis of differential diffusion effects, κ and |∇T | / |∇T |lam .
– It has been shown that the global mean curvature of flame kernels
reduces the mixture state parameters (h, φ, YH ) inside the reaction zone,
which lowers the heat release rate and scalar gradients. This effect is
most pronounced during the initial phase of flame kernel development
and can therefore be effectively compensated by ignition energy supply.
After ignition effects have decayed, the effect of mean kernel curvature
turned out to be small compared to the overall reduction in heat release
rate due to Le > 1 observed in a statistically planar flame (under the
present conditions). However, the effect of global mean curvature is
dominant over the impact of the characteristic curvature PDF shape
caused by early flame kernel/turbulence interactions [8].
41

– As suggested by the (DLe )-Eq., in case of κ = 0 and |∇T | = |∇T |lam ,
the turbulent flames should locally recover the behavior of an unstretched laminar flame. This has been confirmed by ω̇T and (h, φ, YH )
dependencies on |∇T | that are almost identical to the laminar premixed counterflow configuration, which indicates that differential diffusion effects are not weakened by turbulent micro-mixing under engine
part-load conditions. This finding is consistent with previous results
by Savard and Blanquart [46].
– By considering turbulent planar flame elements with zero curvature,
hydrodynamic strain was shown to substantially reduce the heat release rate in the Le > 1 flame on average. However, the local tangential
strain rate at a given point in time was found to be only weakly correlated with the local heat release rate for Le > 1, which is in agreement
with previous studies [46, 53]. Here, it is argued that strain alters
the two-way coupled system [|∇c| − (T, h, φ, YH ) − ω̇c − |∇c|] mainly
through the (|∇c|)-Eq., which in turn contains the heat-release-rate
response. Since the dynamic propagation of strain effects through the
coupled system of governing flame parameters is characterized by several hydrodynamic, diffusive and chemical time scales, it is suggested
to investigate the effect of strain on unsteady Le 6= 1 flames by means
of time series analyses in a flame-attached reference frame in the future.
– The presented parameter correlations for the flame structure of flame
kernels overall recover the behavior of the fully developed turbulent
planar flame, after the excess enthalpy and high scalar gradients intro-

42

duced by spark ignition have decayed within approximately two laminar
flame times (under the present conditions).
It should be noted that the overall detrimental behavior of the stoichiometric
iso-octane/air flames compared to the Le = 1 reference flames presented in
this work directly translates to common transportation fuels which feature
Lewis numbers larger than unity. Although the Reynolds number in the
present DNS database is at least two times smaller than in practical engines,
the main conclusions should remain valid under more realistic conditions
since the Karlovitz number has been closely matched (cf. Tab. 3). More
detailed investigations on the microscopic role of spark ignition during early
flame kernel development are suggested for future work.

Appendix A. Assessment of a Mean-Curvature-Based Modeling
Approach
Recall that in Fig. 7, the effect of positive global mean flame kernel curvature on the mean heat release rate of flame kernels has been estimated.
This analysis was based on the convolution of a modified, time varying curvature PDF of the developing planar flame with the heat release rate of
the planar flame in the fully developed limit. In this way, differences in
the curvature distribution between both flame configurations could be isolated from differences in the curvature-conditioned mean heat release rate.
Here, this approach is revisited since it can be relevant for modeling. In
Fig. A.1 (a), the curvature-conditioned heat release rate during early flame
kernel development on the TmaxHR -iso-surface is compared against the planar flame results that were presented in Fig. 6 (a). Initially, the effect of
spark ignition is dominant, which decays within less than one integral time
scale. Note that for |κ| < lf , the heat release rate of the flame kernels then
drops slightly below the curve corresponding to the fully developed planar
flame that was used for the convolution-based analysis presented in Sect. 4.1.
This might be due to the fact that in the flame kernel configuration, local
flame segments fluctuate around a positive mean curvature with on average
lower mean heat release rate than in the planar flame with near-zero mean
curvature. If the convolution-based analysis approach pursued in Sect. 4.1
shall be extended to flame kernel modeling, the observed discrepancies in
44

the curvature-conditioned mean heat release rate of flame kernels and the
developed flame will lead to inaccuracies, particularly during the early flame
kernel development phase.
In the following, the performance of a model given by the curvature PDF
of the fully developed planar flame, but corrected by the mean flame kernel
curvature, convoluted with the heat release rate of the fully developed planar flame will be tested. Similar to the analysis presented in Sect. 4.1, the
convolution has been evaluated for both the modeled and the actual flame
kernel PDF, but for multiple temperature iso-surfaces throughout the flame
structure. In Fig. A.1 (b,c,d), the results are compared against the actual
flame kernel and planar flame DNS data at three different time instants.
The similarity of both convolutions confirms the dominant effect of mean
flame kernel curvature over the actual shape of the PDF (characterized by
higher order moments). After the initial ignition phase, the model predicts
a heat release rate that falls between the two DNS results, as expected. In
order to develop a more accurate model based on the present approach, a
description of the curvature-conditioned heat release rate of flame kernels
would need to be incorporated.
