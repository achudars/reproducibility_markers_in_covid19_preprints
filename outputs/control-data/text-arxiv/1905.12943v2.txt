ABSTRACT:
The electronic transport and photoelectric properties of hydrogenated borophene B4H4, which
was realized in a recent experiment by Nishino, et al. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 139, 13761 (2017)],
are systematically investigated using the density functional theory and non-equilibrium
Green’s function methods. We find that B4H4 exhibits a perfect current-limiting effect and has
high (along the zigzag direction) and low (along the armchair one) optional levels due to its
strong electrical anisotropy. Moreover, B4H4 can generate sizable photocurrents under
illumination, with strong photoelectronic response to blue/green light along the
zigzag/armchair direction. Our work demonstrates that B4H4 is promising for the applications
of current limiter and photodetectors.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, borophene and its derivatives have received increasing attention since its
successful realization in 2015 [1,2]. Many different types of borophene-based monolayer (ML)
[3-6] structures have been proposed in theory, and they are promising for a variety of
applications [7], including Dirac materials [8], lithium-sulfur batteries [9], spin-filters [10],
superconducting materials [11], hydrogen storage media [12], and catalysts [13]. The
borophene MLs such as the out-of-plane buckling sheets [1] and β12 and χ3 boron sheets [2]
are often fabricated on metal (Ag) substrates, as a truly free-standing two-dimensional (2D)
borophene is unstable according to theoretical studies [14,15]. Many fabrication strategies
have been proposed to produce free-standing 2D borophene, such as using transition metal
adatoms [16-18] and hydrogenation to saturate the dangling bonds [3,14,15,19].

Several stable hydrogenated borophene structures, such as the C2/m, Pbcm, and Cmmm
phases, were recently predicted [3,14,20,21]. In particular, the Cmmm-phase B4H4 ML is a
Dirac ring material [20] with a mechanical anisotropy along the zigzag and armchair
directions, and has a high thermal conductivity [21]. The Cmmm-phase B4H4 ML has been
successfully fabricated with exfoliation and complete ion-exchange method at room
temperature [22]. To explore the potential of utilizing this material in nanodevices, further
investigations of 2D B4H4 MLs are needed, especially for its electronic transport and
photoelectronic response properties that have been largely left unveiled. Several important
aspects that need to be thoroughly examined include: (a) does the 2D B4H4 ML have any
peculiar current−voltage (I−V) behavior? (b) how strong is its electrical anisotropy? (c) what
is its photoelectronic response under illumination? (d) is there any unique feature for potential
device application?

In this paper, we systematically study the electronic transport and photoelectronic
2

response properties of a 2D B4H4 ML (see Figure 1(a)) by using the first-principles approach.
We find that the 2D B4H4 ML exhibits a strong electrical anisotropy along the zigzag and
armchair directions. It exhibits a significant current-limiting (CL) effect and has two optional
levels, i.e., high-level along the zigzag direction (z-B4H4) and low-level along the armchair
one (a-B4H4). Moreover, B4H4 can generate sizeable photocurrents in blue (green) light along
the zigzag (armchair) direction.

II. METHODS
The electronic structures, electronic transport, and photoelectronic response properties
of the 2D B4H4 ML are determined by using the density functional theory and nonequilibrium
Green’s function approach, as implemented in the Atomistix Toolkit (ATK) [23-25]. The
exchange and correlation effect among electrons is described with the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) [26,27]. The B-1s core electrons are represented by the optimized
Norm-Conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV) pseudo-potentials. The wave functions of valence
states are expanded as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO), at the level of SG15
[28] pseudo-potentials and basis sets, which are fully relativistic and can provide comparable
results as the all-electron approach. We use an energy cutoff 200 Ry for the basis expansion.
The positions of all atoms in the unit cell are relaxed until the residual force on each atom is
less than 0.005 eV/Å and the total free-energy tolerance is below 10−6 eV, respectively. Then
the two-probe structures are constructed by repeating the unit cell. For the electronic transport
calculations, we use a 1×7×150 Monkhorst-Pack k-points grid to sample the 2D Brillouin
zone of the electrodes, to achieve a balance between the cost and accuracy.

structures of rectangular B4H4 along the Γ–X and Γ–Y directions. Top and side views of
eigenstates of bands I (c) and II (d) at Γ point. The isovalue is set to 0.25 Å(–3/2).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1(a) shows the top and side views of 2D B4H4 ML. After geometry optimization,
the lattice parameters a and b of the rectangular B4H4 unit cell are 3.000 and 5.299 Å,
respectively, both in good agreement with the previous report [20]. It is easier to investigate
its electrical anisotropy using a rectangular unit cell, including constructing a two-probe
structure and performing transport calculations [29,30]. Figure 1(b) shows the band structures
along the zigzag (Γ–X) and armchair (Γ–Y) directions, respectively. There are two bands (i.e.,
I and II) crossing the Fermi level (EF) along these two directions. The hole effective mass of
band II shows an obvious anisotropy, which can lead to an anisotropic current of a monolayer
4

material (e.g., phosphorene) [31]. It is smaller along the zigzag direction (mx = 0.32m0) than
along the armchair one (my = 0.56m0). As a result, one may expect larger electron transmission
along the zigzag direction. In addition, the eigenstates of bands I and II, which are composed
of the hybrid px orbitals of B atoms, are widely distributed on the zigzag B chains (see Fig.
1(c)) and very beneficial to the electron transmission. Except that, the eigenstates of band II
at the Γ point are composed of the pz orbitals of B atoms and very localized (see Fig. 1(d)),
which are unbeneficial to the electron transmission? Test calculations indicate that inclusion
of van der Waals correction doesn’t change the electronic and transport properties of B4H4
ML.

To investigate the electrical transport properties, we construct the two-probe structure of
2D B4H4 (see Fig. 2) and directly calculate its electronic conductivities along the zigzag (X
axis) and armchair (Y axis) directions. This 2D structure has a periodicity perpendicular to the
transport direction between the drain (D) and source (S) electrodes. The third direction is out
of the plane, along which the slabs are separated by a vacuum (more than 15 Å). Both the
drain and source electrodes are described by a large supercell and are semi-infinite in length
along the transport direction. We use the Dirichlet boundary conditions along the transport
direction and periodic boundary conditions in the other two orthogonal directions. When a
drain-source bias Vb is applied across the D and S electrodes, their Fermi energies are shifted
accordingly. A positive bias gives rise to an electric current from the D electrode to the S
electrode, and vice versa. In the present work, the current I through the z-B4H4 and a-B4H4
diode structures is determined by using the Landauer–Büttiker formula [32]

where T(E,Vb) is the bias-dependent transmission coefficient, calculated from the Green’s
functions; fD/S are the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions of the drain/source electrodes; μD (=
EF – eVb/2) and μS (= EF + eVb/2) are the electrochemical potentials of the drain and source
electrodes respectively, and [μD, μS] defines the bias window (BW). More details of this
method can be seen in the previous literatures [23-25].

FIG. 3. (a) Transmission spectra at zero bias and (b) I−V curves of z-B4H4 and a-B4H4. The
Fermi level is shifted to zero.
Figure 3(a) shows the transmission spectra of z-B4H4 and a-B4H4 at zero bias, both of
which have several steps and show an obvious quantized characteristic, analogous to
graphene and other graphene-like structures [33-35]. It appears to be easier for electrons
within a broad energy region (below 0.43 eV) to transmit along the zigzag direction due to
their larger transmission coefficients, except in the high positive energy region (above 0.43
eV). As a result, z-B4H4 has larger equilibrium conductance (about 1.7 G0) than a-B4H4 (about
1.3 G0). Here, we only show results of z-B4H4/a-B4H4 with 14/10 rectangular unit cells in the
scattering region. Nevertheless, our test calculations indicate that further length expansion
gives little influence on the transport properties and we will focus our following discussions
with results from the 14/10 unit cells.

Figure 3(b) displays the I−V curves of z-B4H4 and a-B4H4 under biases from 0 to 1.6 V.
Interestingly, they both show a perfect current-limiting effect when the threshold voltage is
7

beyond 0.6 V. This has a useful application in electrical circuits by imposing an upper limit on
the current for the protection purpose. This effect is characterized by two key factors that
depend on materials and may vary substantially in experiments. The first factor is the
threshold voltage where the current-limiting effect appears. In general, it is desired to have
low CL voltage for minimizing the power consumption. The second one is the value of
saturation current, which mainly determines the performance index of a CL device. The
B4H4-based CL nanodevice has a threshold bias of 0.6 V and large saturation current with two
optional levels, i.e., high-level (24.0 µA) along the zigzag direction and low-level (16.5 µA)
along the armchair one. Thus, the B4H4 shows a strong electrical anisotropy, and its ratio of
current anisotropy η=Iz/Ia (Iz and Ia refer to the saturation current of z-B4H4 and a-B4H4,
respectively) is about 1.5, equal to that of χ-borophene [36]. Note that the conductance of
B4H4 decreases as the bias increases, and its maximum conductivity is about 1.5×105 S/m, less
than that of Al (3.8×107 S/m), Au (4.5×107 S/m), and Cu (5.9×107 S/m). Therefore, the B4H4
ML is a good candidate for the use in current limiters.

z-B4H4 (d) and a-B4H4 (e) at various biases. (f) PDOS of z-B4H4 at 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 V,
respectively. The shadows in (a)-(c) and black dashed lines in (d) and (e) are the bias windows.
The red ellipses in (c) indicate the entrance of band into the bias window.

To unveil the physical origin of the current-limiting effect of B4H4, we analyze its band
structures and transmission spectra under varying biases. In general, the electronic transport
of monolayers is mainly determined by their band structures from the intra- and inter-band
transitions around the Fermi level [37]. One side, only the electrons in the states between the
bias window can contribute to the current [33,37]. For another, the band properties, including
the parity limitation [33], the projection of element [38], and its localization, also play a key
9

role in the electronic transport. Figures 4(a)-(c) show results of the z-B4H4 under biases of 0.3,
0.6, and 1.0 V, respectively. As a forward bias is applied to the drain and source electrodes,
their bands shift down and up accordingly. The electron transmission of B4H4 ML is mostly
dependent on the band overlaps between the bands I and II of the drain and source electrodes,
as well as its band localization. As the bias increases, such as from 0 to 0.6 V, the band
overlaps are gradually increasing. (see Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)). The electron transmission
probability is similar (see Fig. 4(d)) due to their consistent band properties. Thus, its integral
over the BW according to Eq. (1) (i.e., current) increases monotonically as the bias windows
expands (see Fig. 3(b)). Note that the transmission coefficients near the energies of IIx-D at the
Γ point are always smaller due to its localized eigenstates at Γ (see Fig. 1(d)). When the bias
is beyond 0.6 V, the band overlaps change little. But the localized eigenstates (at Γ) of band
IIx-D enter into the bias window (see Fig. 4(c)), leading to the obvious decrease of
transmission coefficients. That is, the transmission around the Fermi level drops as a gap
develops in the scattering region under the influence of a high electric field. This is shown by
the evolution of the projected density of states (PDOS) of z-B4H4 in the scattering region as
the bias increases from 0.3 to 0.6 and 1.0 V (see Fig. 4(f)). These give rise to the saturation of
current beyond 0.6 V (i.e., current-limiting effect) of z-B4H4 even though the BW expands.
The same CL mechanism is applicable to the a-B4H4. As the band IIx of z-B4H4 and band IIy
of a-B4H4 have different effective masses, a-B4H4 has a less efficient electron transmission
(see Fig. 4(e)) and lower I−V curve (see Fig. 3(b)). Then the electrical anisotropy appears, and
the high-level/low-level current-limiting effect is achievable along the zigzag/armchair
direction.

The electric conduction can be resolved into contributions through different pathways in
the system [39]. The local current between all pairs of atoms A and B, where A is on one side
of the two-probe structure and B is on the other, equals the total current:

To further understand the physical picture of electronic transport of B4H4 at the atomic level,
we analyze its electron transmission pathways and corresponding atomic orbital origin.
Generally, there are two types of local current pathways: via electron hopping (i.e., hopping
current) between atoms or via chemical bonds (i.e., bond current) [40]. Our results show that
B-B bonds play the dominant role for both z-B4H4 and a-B4H4. The bond current of z-B4H4 is
along the zigzag chains parallel to the transport direction (see Fig. 5(a)). However, the bond
current of a-B4H4 is mainly along the “step-like” pathways, which is unparallel to the
transport direction but with an angle (see Fig. 5(b)). It reduces the electron transmission
probability and suppresses the I−V curve along the armchair direction.

The transmission coefficient of z-B4H4 at the EF under the bias of 0.6 V is about 1.2 (see
Fig. 4(b)), implying that there are two degenerate transmission channels (because this is a
single-electron transmission process with a transmission probability no more than 1 for each
channel). Figures 5(c) and 5(d) give the eigenstates of the two transmission channels (i.e.,
TE-I and TE-II) of z-B4H4, both are very delocalized and spread over the B atoms along the
zigzag B4H4 chains and contribute to the electron transmission. For the a-B4H4, it also has two
degenerate transmission eigenstates despite its transmission coefficient is about 0.8, less than
z-B4H4. However, the TE-II of a-B4H4 (see Fig. 5(f)) is quite localized, only its TE-I (see Fig.
5(e)) has effective contribution to the current, which is unbeneficial to its electron
transmission and causes its depressed I−V curve (see Fig. 3(b)).

density of the z-B4H4 and a-B4H4 photoelectronic nanodevices. The embedded spectrum
pattern shows the visible light region.

The monolayer nanomaterials may also find potential application in the fast-growing
12

photoelectronics. For instance, the graphene-based photodetectors had been fabricated in
experiments [41-45]. The large electrical anisotropy of B4H4 ML inspires us to further explore
its photoelectronic properties. Figure 6(b) shows the photon absorption coefficient γ as a
function of photon energy along the zigzag and armchair directions. Within the visible light
region and the AM1.5 standard [46], both the z-B4H4 and a-B4H4 have a strong absorption
peak but appeared at different photon energy positions. Namely, the z-B4H4 is favorable to
absorb the blue light (near 2.62 eV photon energy) with a large coefficient γ=1.2×104 cm-1,
while a-B4H4 prefers to absorb the green one (near 2.24 eV) with a coefficient γ=0.3×104 cm-1.
Note that in the ultraviolet region, B4H4 (especial along the armchair direction) has stronger
photon absorption. It is hence indicated that the B4H4 could can be used in the photoelectronic
devices, such as photodetectors.

Several 2D materials have been predicted as candidates of photoelectronic devices
[30,47,48]. In particular, a few 2D-material-based (e.g., phosphorene and palladium
diselenide) photodetectors have been predicted in recent reports [48,49]. Black phosphorus
mid-infrared photodetectors and graphene heterojunction infrared photodetectors have already
been realized in experiments [45,50,51]. To further explore the potential application of B4H4
in photoelectronics, we construct a B4H4-based photodiode (see Fig. 6(a)), and calculate its
photocurrent along the zigzag and armchair directions by means of a theoretical method that
was developed based on density functional theory within the nonequilibrium Green’s function
approach [29,52,53]. Using this method, we can obtain the photocurrent that flows through a
photodiode composed of the drain and source electrodes and the central scattering region
when it is irradiated by polarized light. More specifically, the photocurrent can be calculated
as a first-order perturbation to the electronic system, originating from the interaction with a
weak electromagnetic field. The electron-photon interaction is described by the Hamiltonian

where  , r , and r refer to the isotropic homogeneous permittivity, relative permittivity, and

polarization of the light, and Pml is the momentum operator. The total photocurrent is then
given by Iph = ID−IS. In the present work, the photon energy from 0 to 5 eV is detected and the
linearly polarized light along the transport direction is considered.

Figure 6(c) shows the maps of photocurrent density as a function of photon energy for
the z-B4H4 and a-B4H4 under zero drain-source bias. Interestingly, upon illumination, B4H4
can generate observable photocurrents along both the zigzag and armchair directions. The
total photoexcited current density per second is about 26.1 µA/cm2 along the zigzag direction
under the AM1.5 standard [46], significantly larger than along the armchair one (about 0.4
µA/cm2), which can be measured experimentally with a proper laser power [54,55]. B4H4 ML
shows high anisotropy in the photocurrents along the zigzag and armchair directions,
14

analogous to the phosphorene photodetector [48]. Differently, phosphorene photodetector has
larger photocurrent along the armchair direction, which is up to two orders of magnitude
higher than that along the zigzag one. Under the visible light region, both the z-B4H4 and
a-B4H4 have a photocurrent peak, and they are excited at blue (green) light for the z-B4H4
(a-B4H4). This is mainly because that both the z-B4H4 and a-B4H4 have large absorption
coefficient to that light with the corresponding color. Thus, B4H4 can be used as a
photodetector based on its different photoelectronic response along the zigzag and armchair
directions. Recent success in fabrication of photodetectors based on 2D materials, including
PdSe2 [49], graphene-based heterojunctions [45,50], and black phosphorous [51], indicates
that the use of B4H4-based as photodetector is also possible. To detect the photoelectronic
response along the two directions (i.e., zigzag and armchair), one may obtain strong signals
under the illumination of blue and green lights, respectively.

IV. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, by means of the first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate
the electronic transport and photoelectronic properties of 2D B4H4 ML along the zigzag and
armchair directions. Our results show that B4H4 ML presents a promising current-limiting
effect and possess two optional levels along the zigzag direction (high-level) and armchair
one (low-level) because of its strong electrical anisotropy. Furthermore, B4H4 can generate
sizable photocurrents under illumination, with strong photon absorption to blue/green light
along the zigzag/armchair direction. Our results unveil that the B4H4 ML is promising for the
utilization in current limiters and photodetectors.
