Abstract
For a complex polynomial
f (s) = sn + an−1 sn−1 + . . . + a1 s + a0
and for a rational number p, we consider the Schur stability problem of
the p-th Hadamard power of f
f [p] (s) = sn + apn−1 sn−1 + . . . + ap1 s + ap0 .
We show that there exist two numbers p∗ ≥ 0 ≥ p∗ such that f [p] is
Schur stable for every p > p∗ and is not Schur stable for p < p∗ (or vice
versa, depending on f ). Also, we give simple sufficient conditions for the
Schur stability of the Hadamard product of two complex polynomials.
Numerical examples complete and illustrate the results.

Introduction

Over two decades ago, in 1996, Garloﬀ and Wagner [1] provided an interesting
property of the Hurwitz stable polynomials. They proved that the Hadamard
product (i.e. element-wise multiplication) of two real Hurwitz stable polynomials is again Hurwitz stable. An immediate consequence of the Garloﬀ–Wagner
result is that the stability of f implies that of f [p] , the p-th Hadamard power
of f , for every positive integer p. Gregor and Tišer [4] claimed that even more
is true, that is, that the p-th Hadamard power of a Hurwitz stable polynomial
is Hurwitz stable for every real power p > 1. Unfortunately, as Bialas and

Applied Mathematics AGH UST statutory tasks (grant no. 11.11.420.004) within subsidy of

Bialas-Cież proved in their recent work [5], they were wrong, i.e. for a stable
polynomial f , the polynomial f [p] does not need to be Hurwitz stable for p > 1.
Motivated by the work of Bialas and Bialas-Cież, we will focus the attention
on the Schur stability problem of the Hadamard powers of complex polynomials.
It is known that the result of Garloﬀ and Wagner does not extend neither to
the complex case nor to the class of the Schur stable polynomials (see Bose and
Gregor [2] or again Garloﬀ and Wagner [1]). The main aim of this work is to
show that for a very wide class of complex polynomials including, among others,
unstable elements, it is possible to ﬁnd two numbers p∗ ≥ 0 ≥ p∗ depending on f
and such that the p–th Hadamard power of f is Schur stable for every p > p∗ and
is not Schur stable for every p < p∗ (or vice versa). Some attention is also paid
to possibility of construction of families of the Schur stable polynomials with
complex coeﬃcients that are closed under the Hadamard multiplication. The
obtained results complete and generalize those given by Garloﬀ and Wagner [1],
Gregor and Tišer [4] and Bialas and Bialas-Cież [5].

2.1

Preliminary results
Basic notations

We use standard notation: Q, R and C stand for the set of rational numbers,
real numbers and complex numbers, respectively; πn (C) stands for the family of
n–th degree monic polynomials with complex coeﬃcients; |·| denotes the moduli
of a complex number and i stands for the imaginary unit.

2.2

Stable polynomials

A polynomial is said to be Schur stable (shortly stable) if all its zeros lie in
the open unit disc. From among many suﬃcient conditions for the stability
of a polynomial we recall the one following from the bound for the moduli of
zeros of polynomials given by Fujiwara [6]: a polynomial f ∈ πn (C) of the
form f (s) = sn + an−1 sn−1 + . . . + a1 s + a0 is stable if it satisﬁes the stability
condition, i.e. there exist {λk }, a sequence of positive numbers whose sum does
not exceed 1, such that the following condition holds
|ak | < λk ,

for k ∈ Nf

(1)

where Nf = {k ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1} : ak 6= 0} (the proof of suﬃciency of (1) for
the stability of f can be easily derived from Fujiwara’s work [6], but for the
sake of completeness of the article we present it in Appendix A). It seems to
be interesting and important to note that the stability condition (1) is sharp
in the sense that for every ε ≥ 0 and for every sequence of positive
Pn−1numbers
λ0 , . . . , λn−1 summing up to 1 + ε, the polynomial s → sn − k=0 λk sk is
unstable.

2.3

The Hadamard product and the Hadamard powers of
polynomials

For two polynomials f, g ∈ πn (C) ,
f (s) = sn + an−1 sn−1 + . . . + a1 s + a0
g (s) = sn + bn−1 sn−1 + . . . + b1 s + b0

(2)

we deﬁne their Hadamard product f ◦ g as an n–th degree polynomial of the
form
(f ◦ g) (s) = sn + an−1 bn−1 sn−1 + . . . + a1 b1 s + a0 b0 .
In turn, for p ∈ Q the polynomial f [p]
f [p] (s) = sn + apn−1 sn−1 + . . . + ap1 s + ap0 ,
is called the p-th Hadamard power of f (we put, by deﬁnition, that 0p = 0
for p ∈ Q). If p is an integer then f [p] is a polynomial. However, if p is
a non-integer rational number, say p = k/m with k and m relatively prime
integers, then p–th power of the complex number ai is not a number but is
a set of m complex numbers whose m-th power gives aki . In other words, for
aj = |aj | (cos αj + i sin αj ) we have apj = apj,0 , . . . , apj,m−1 , where
p

apj,l = |aj | (cos (pαj + 2πl/m) + i sin (pαj + 2πl/m)) ,

(3)

for l = 0, . . . , m − 1. In that case, the p-th Hadamard power of a polynomial
should be understood as a set of mn polynomials
s → sn + apn−1,ln−1 sn−1 + . . . + ap1,l1 s + ap0,l0

(4)

whose coeﬃcients are calculated as in (3).

Main results

3.1

The Schur stability of the Hadamard powers of a polynomial

Let, for f as in (2) and for Nf as on page 2,
o
n
P
Λf = {λk }k∈Nf : λk ∈ (0, 1],
k∈Nf λk ≤ 1 .

We are now ready to formulate the main result of this work.

Theorem 1 For f ∈ πn (C) as in (2) the following hold:
(a) if Nf is non-empty and |ak | < 1 for k ∈ Nf , then f [p] is Schur stable for
every p > p∗max ≥ 0 where
p∗max =

inf

max

{λk }∈Λf k∈Nf

ln λk
;
ln |ak |

(5)

(b) if Nf is non-empty and |ak | > 1 for k ∈ Nf , then f [p] is Schur stable for
every p < p∗min ≤ 0 where
p∗min =

sup

min

{λk }∈Λf k∈Nf

ln λk
;
ln |ak |

(6)

(c) if Nf is empty, then f [p] is stable for every p ∈ Q.
Proof. If Nf is empty then the result is obvious. Suppose thus that Nf
is non-empty.
We can restrict our considerations
real polynomial s →
Pn−1
Pn−1to the
p
sn + k=0 |ak | sk and its p–th power s → sn + k=0 |ak | sk being a polynomial
Pn−1
with nonnegative coeﬃcients. Indeed, if the real polynomial s → sn + k=0 rk sk
with nonnegative coeﬃcients r0 , . . . , rn−1 satisﬁes the stability condition, then
every complex polynomial whose k–th coeﬃcient has the moduli equal to rk
(for k = 0, . . . , n − 1) satisﬁes it too. In other words, the polynomial s →
Pn−1
p
sn + k=0 |ak | sk satisﬁes the stability condition if and only if each polynomial
of the form (4), and thus f [p] , does.
Let {λk } be an arbitrary element of Λf . The stability condition applied to
the polynomial f [p] gives
p ln |ak | < ln λk
(7)
for k ∈ Nf . If |ak | < 1 for k = 0, . . . , n − 1, then (7) leads to
p > max
k∈Nf

ln λk
ln |ak |

(8)

and in case |ak | > 1 for k ∈ Nf , it leads to
p < min

k∈Nf

ln λk
.
ln |ak |

(9)

Since it is suﬃcient for the stability of f [p] that inequality (8) or inequality (9)
holds for at least one sequence {λk }, we can repeat the same for every {λk } ∈ Λf
and take in (8) inﬁmum over all {λk } and supremum over all {λk } in (9). This
yields to (a) and (b).
Remark 1 As it is known (see Example 5.3 in Saydy et al. [7]), in the entire
family of real polynomials having all roots in the closed unit disc, the so-called
guardian map
Φ : f → f (1) f (−1) det Df ,
where Df is some real matrix of order n − 1 formed from the coefficients of
f , vanishes if and only if f is unstable (has a root on the unit circle). Thus,
when for a real polynomial f with nonnegative coefficients there exists, as in
Theorem 1, a number p∗ for which f [p] is stable for p > p∗ (or for p < p∗ )
then the minimal (maximal) value of such p∗ can be calculated as the maximal
(minimal) real zero of the function
Φf : p → f [p] (1) f [p] (−1) det Df [p] .
4

In case of a complex polynomial f and its integer Hadamard powers, such p∗ , if
any, can be calculated as the maximal (minimal) real zero of the function
[p]

[p]

Φ̃f : p → fRe (1) fRe (−1) det Df [p] ,
Re

where fRe = f¯·f and f¯ is a polynomial whose coefficients are complex conjugates
of these of f .
The next theorem shows that the assumptions of Theorem 1 are relevant.
Theorem 2 For f ∈ πn (C) as in (2) the following hold:
(a) if the set Nf is non-empty and k ∗ = min {k : k ∈ Nf }, then f [p] is not
Schur stable for every p ≤ 0 if |ak∗ | ≤ 1 and for every p ≥ 0 if |ak∗ | ≥ 1;
(b) if the set Nf,1+ = {k ∈ Nf : |ak | > 1} is non-empty, then f [p] is not Schur
∗
stable for every p ≥ βmax
≥ 0, where

ln nk
∗
βmax = min
;
k∈Nf,1+ ln |ak |
(c) if the set Nf,1− = {k ∈ Nf : |ak | < 1} is non-empty, then f [p] is not Schur
∗
stable for every p ≤ βmin
≤ 0 where

ln nk
∗
.
βmin = max
k∈Nf,1− ln |ak |
Proof. Since ak∗ is, with accuracy to the sign, a product of all nonzero roots of
the polynomial f , condition (a) is obvious. To prove (b)and (c), recall that a
necessary condition for the stability of f is that |ak | < nk , for k = 0, . . . , n − 1.
In other words, if for some k ∈ Nf ,
 
n
p ln |ak | ≥ ln
,
(10)
k
∗
then f [p] is not stable. For k ∈ Nf,1+ (10) follows from p ≥ βmax
proving (b)
∗
and for k ∈ Nf,1− from p ≤ βmin proving (c).

3.2

The Schur stability of the Hadamard product of polynomials

Now, we will focus the attention on the stability of the Hadamard product f ◦ g
of two complex polynomials f, g ∈ πn (C). As mentioned in the introductory
section, the Hadamard product of two stable (real or complex) polynomials does
not have to be stable. In case of real polynomials, Gregor and Bose [2] noted
that when multiplying, in the Hadamard sense, the Hadamard product f ◦ g of
−1 k
Pn
two Schur stable polynomials f and g by the polynomial h (x) = k=0 nk
x ,
5

then the product f ◦g◦h, called sometimes the Szegö product of f and g, becomes
Schur stable.
The following theorem gives simple suﬃcient conditions for the Schur stability of both the Hadamard and the Szegö product of two complex polynomials.
Theorem 3 Let f, g ∈ πn (C) be two polynomials of the form (2).
(a) If f satisfies the stability condition and |bk | ≤ 1 for k ∈ Ng ∩ Nf , then
both the Szegö product and the Hadamard product of f and g satisfy the
stability condition (and thus are stable).

(b) If f satisfies the stability condition and |bk | ≤ nk for k ∈ Ng ∩ Nf , then
the Szegö product of f and g satisfies the stability condition (and thus is
stable). In particular, if f satisfies the stability condition and g is stable,
then the Szegö product of f and g satisfies the stability condition (and thus
is stable).
(c) If f and g satisfy the following condition
p
max {|ak | , |bk |} < λk ,
for every k ∈ Nf ∩ Ng ,
where {λk } is a sequence of positive numbers whose sum does not exceed 1,
then both the Szegö product and the Hadamard product of f and g satisfy
the stability condition (and thus are stable).
Instead of the proof, which is a simple consequence of the stability condition,
we make some remarks.
Firstly, note that the assumptions on g in Theorem 3.(a) and Theorem 3.(b)
do not imply its stability. It means that for the Schur stability of the Hadamard
product or the Szegö product of two complex polynomials f and g, it suﬃces to
require slightly more than the stability of f and slightly less than the stability
of g. As we know, the stability of f and g does not suﬃce.
Note also, that the assumption on f and g in Theorem 3.(c) does not guarantee their stability. Theorem 3.(c) can be thus viewed as a suﬃcient condition for
the stability of the Hadamard product and the Szegö product of two (unstable)
polynomials.
We close this part with the following conclusion (its simple proof based on
the stability condition is omitted).
Conclusion 4 For every non-zero polynomial f ∈ πn (C) there exists a stable polynomial g ∈ πn (C) such that both the Szegö product and the Hadamard
product of f and g are stable.

3.3

Does it work for polynomials of fractional orders?

At the end, let us note that all the above results can also be applied to fractionalorder polynomials.

6

Recall that a fractional-order polynomial is a function of the form
f : s → sσn + an−1 sσn−1 + . . . + a1 sσ1 + a0 ,

(11)

where a0 , . . . , an−1 are known coeﬃcients and σn > σn−1 > . . . > σ1 > 0 are
known powers being real numbers. The polynomials of non-integer order play an
important role in the stability analysis of linear time-invariant fractional-order
systems (e.g. Matignon [3]) and have recently attracted lots of attention in the
control theory literature.
If at least one power in (11) is non-integer, then the fractional-order polynomial f is a multivalued function. Supposing that σk = αk for some positive
number α (f is then said to be of a commensurate order) and substituting
sα = w in (11), we obtain an integer-order polynomial Ff associated with f
Ff (w) = wn + an−1 wn−1 + . . . + a1 w + a0 .
As α is a rational number, every root of Ff gives a ﬁnite set of roots of f (as in
(3)). Moreover, according to sα = w, f is Schur stable if and only if Ff is. This
shows that Theorems 1–3 and Conclusion 4 can be applied to both integer-order
and fractional-order polynomials.

Numerical experiments

In closing, we shall give two numerical examples completing and illustrating the
results developed in this work.
Example 1 Consider two real polynomials f and g
f (s) = s5 + 0.9s2 + 0.2s + 0.7,
g (s) = s5 + 2.5s2 + 2s + 3,
both having zeros outside the unit disc and thus unstable. In order to illustrate Theorem 1 we need to approximate value (5) for f and value (6) for g.
The approximations were obtained by generating sequences {λk } of the form
{ml/n2, m (n − l) /n2 , (n − m) /n} for n = 103 and m, l = 1, . . . , n − 1, and
performing necessary computations. The approximation of (5) for f is p∗max ≈
3.40372, whereas the minimal value of p∗ such that f [p] is stable for every p > p∗
(see Remark 1) is equal to p∗ ≈ 3.35457. The approximation of (6) for g is
p∗min ≈ −1.24121, whereas the minimal value of p∗ such that g [p] is stable for
every p < p∗ is equal to p∗ ≈ −1.01579.
Example 2 Consider two complex polynomials f and g
f (s) = s4 + (0.2 − 0.4i) s3 + 0.7s − 0.9i,
g (s) = s4 − 1.5s3 + (2 − i) s2 + 1 − 0.5i.

Figure 1: (a) the zeros of f [p] marked with black dots for 1 ≤ p ≤ 3 and with
gray dots for 4 ≤ p ≤ 100; (b) the zeros of g [q] marked with black dots for
−3 ≤ q ≤ −1 and with gray dots for −100 ≤ q ≤ −4.
Proceeding as in Example 1 we get p∗max ≈ 3.69323 for f and p∗min ≈ −3.40696 for
g. To confirm the results we have plotted in Fig. 1 the zeros of f [p] and g [q]
for integer values of p ∈ {1, . . . , 102 } and q ∈ −102 , . . . , −1 . The p-th
Hadamard power of f occurs unstable for 1 ≤ p ≤ 3 and becomes stable for
p ≥ 4, as expected. Similarly, the q-th Hadamard power of g occurs unstable for
−1 ≤ q ≤ −3 and becomes stable for q ≤ −4.
