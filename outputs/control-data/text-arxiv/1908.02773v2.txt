We study the heating time in periodically driven D-dimensional systems with interactions that
decay with the distance r as a power-law 1/r α . Using linear response theory, we show that the
heating time is exponentially long as a function of the drive frequency for α > D. For systems that
may not obey linear response theory, we use a more general Magnus-like expansion to show the
existence of quasi-conserved observables, which imply exponentially long heating time, for α > 2D.
We also generalize a number of recent state-of-the-art Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law systems
from two-body interactions to k-body interactions and thereby obtain a longer heating time than
previously established in the literature. Additionally, we conjecture that the gap between the results
from the linear response theory and the Magnus-like expansion does not have physical implications,
but is, rather, due to the lack of tight Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law interactions. We show
that the gap vanishes in the presence of a hypothetical, tight bound.

INTRODUCTION

Periodically driven systems can host interesting nonequilibrium physics, such as Floquet topological insulators [1], time crystals [2, 3], and anomalous Floquet
phases [4]. However, most driven systems eventually
heat up to equilibrium, infinite-temperature states, erasing the interesting features in the process.
The timescale before heating becomes appreciable in
periodically driven systems is known as the heating time,
and it generally exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the
frequency of the drive, ω. Previous works [5–8] established that finite-range interacting systems under rapid,
local [9], periodic drives could not heat up until after a
time t∗ = eO(ω) that is exponentially long in the drive
frequency ω. This slow heating rate stems at least in part
from the locality of the interactions, which constrains the
probability that distant particles collectively absorb an
energy quantum ~ω.
This result also applies to systems with long-range interactions that decay with the distance r, e.g. as a powerlaw 1/rα . Such systems are of great interest as they
can be implemented in a wide variety of experiments,
such as trapped ions [10, 11], Rydberg atoms [12], ultracold atoms and molecules [13, 14], nitrogen-vacancy
centers [15], and superconducting circuits [16]. On
the theoretical side, for spin systems with disordered,
sign-changing power-law couplings, Ref. [17] demonstrated the exponentially-suppressed heating rate when
α > D/2, where D is the dimensionality of the system. Furthermore, Ref. [8] proved an exponential heating time t∗ = eO(ω) for general power-law interactions
with α > 2D. In contrast, for D < α < 2D, Ref. [8]
only obtained a linear heating time t∗ = O (ω), while
numerical evidence [18] suggests that the heating time is

still exponential within this regime of α.
In this paper, we study the heating time in periodically
driven, power-law interacting systems with α > D from
two different perspectives. Within linear response theory, we show that such systems only heat up after some
time exponentially large as a function of the drive frequency. This result mirrors the statement established for
finite-range interactions in Ref. [5] and extends Ref. [17]
to systems without disorder (though at the expense of a
smaller range of valid α). The result also matches the
numerical evidence in Ref. [18]. For generic periodically
driven, power-law interacting systems that may not obey
the linear response theory—such as those under a strong
drive—we generalize Ref. [6] and construct an effective
time-independent Hamiltonian with power-law interactions. This Hamiltonian closely describes the dynamics
of the driven system up to time t∗ , where t∗ is exponentially large as a function of the drive frequency. We
thereby show that the system cannot heat up until at
least after this timescale.
We note that, although our generalization of Ref. [6]
is different from Ref. [8], it is similar in spirit to their arguments. While Ref. [8] mainly focused on finite-range
interactions, their construction of the effective Hamiltonian by truncating the Magnus series would also apply to power-law systems. However, our approach here
also provides insights into the structure of the effective
Hamiltonian. In particular, we show that the effective
Hamiltonian is also power-law with the same exponent
α as the driven Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we prove
a stronger, albeit still exponential in ω, bound on the
heating time than one would get from the argument in
Ref. [8]. This improvement relies on the use of state-ofthe-art Lieb-Robinson bounds [19, 20], which we develop
for this purpose. In particular, through a new technique,
we generalize the bound in Ref. [20] from two-body to

2
many-body interactions.
Similarly to Ref. [8], our construction requires α >
2D, in contrast to the numerical evidence in Ref. [18]
and to the wider range of validity α > D found in the
linear response theory. Because both Ref. [8] and this
paper crucially rely on Lieb-Robinson bounds to prove
that the heating time is at least exponential in ω, we
conjecture that the aforementioned gap stems from the
lack of a tight Lieb-Robinson bound for α > D, and we
show the gap would vanish if such a tight bound were
to exist. While the linear response theory also utilizes
Lieb-Robinson bounds, it has weaker assumptions and,
therefore, does not require a tighter bound to achieve
the desired result of exponentially suppressed heating
for α > D.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section II, we provide definitions and describe the
systems of interest. In Section III, we review various
Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law systems and extend two of them—including one with the tightest light
cone known to date—to k-body interactions. In Section IV, we prove that in the linear response regime the
heating time is at least exponential in ω for all α > D.
In Section V, we provide a more general analysis using
the Magnus-like expansion and existing Lieb-Robinson
bounds to prove exponentially-long heating times for
α > 2D. We also conjecture a tight Lieb-Robinson
bound that would extend this range of validity to α > D.
Finally, we summarize and discuss potential improvements in Section VI.

SETUP AND DEFINITIONS

We consider a system of N spins in a D-dimensional
square lattice [21]. The system evolves under a periodic,
time-dependent Hamiltonian H(t) with period T , i.e.
H(t + T ) = H(t). While the following analysis works for
any H(t) that is a sum of finite-body interactions, we assume that H(t) is two-body for simplicity. Without loss
of generality, we can write H(t) = H0 + V (t) as the sum
of a time-independent part H0 and a time-dependent
RT
part V (t) such that T1 0 V (t) = 0. We further assume
that H0 and V (t) are both power-law Hamiltonians with
an exponent α.
Definition 1. A Hamiltonian H on a lattice Λ is powerlaw with an exponent
α and a local energy scale η if we
P
can write H = X hX , where hX are Hamiltonians supported on subsets X ⊂ Λ, such that for any two distinct
sites i, j ∈ Λ:
X

X∋i,j

khX k ≤

and the norm h{i} ≤ η for all i ∈ Λ, where k·k denotes the operator norm and dist(i, j) the distance between sites i, j. In addition, we call supX |X| the local
support size, where |X| is the number of sites in X, and

define kHkl = supi
H.

In the following discussion, we assume η = 1, which
sets the timescale for the dynamics of the system. In
addition, we will occasionally write H instead of H(t)
for brevity.

III. LIEB-ROBINSON BOUNDS FOR
MANY-BODY POWER-LAW INTERACTIONS

Before discussing the linear response theory and the
Magnus-like expansion, it is helpful to review the existing
Lieb-Robinson (LR) bounds for power-law interactions.
We will also generalize several of them from two-body
to arbitrary k-body interactions for all k ≥ 2. In particular, we discuss the relations between the bounds in
Refs. [22, 23], which imply logarithmic light cones for all
α > D, and the bounds in Refs. [19, 20, 24], which imply
algebraic light cones for α > 2D.

A.

Lieb-Robinson bounds for α > D

First, we discuss the bounds in Refs. [22, 23], which
are valid for all α > D. Recall that LR bounds are
upper bounds on the norm of the commutator [A(t), B],
where A, B are two operators supported on some subsets
X, Y of the lattice, and A(t) is the time-evolved version
of A under a time-dependent Hamiltonian H. The minimum distance between a site in X and a site in Y is
r = dist(X, Y ) > 0. Since the sets X, Y are disjoint,
[A(0), B] = 0 initially. As time grows, the operator A(t)
may spread to Y , making the commutator nontrivial.
The first LR bound for power-law interactions was
proven in Ref. [22] by Hastings and Koma (HK):
C(t, r) ≡ k[A(t), B]k ≤ C kAk kBk |X| |Y |

evt
,
rα

(2)

where r = dist(X, Y ), v ∝ η is a constant that may
depend on α, and C is a constant independent of the
system. We shall also use the same C to denote different inconsequential prefactors. Setting the commutator
norm to a constant yields the light cone t & log r, which
means it takes time at least proportional to log r for the
commutator to reach a given constant value.
Technically, we can already use the HK bound in our
later analysis of the heating time because it applies to
k-body interactions for all k. However, this bound is
loose for large α for two reasons: i) the velocity v ∝ 2α
diverges for α → ∞, ii) the light cone is logarithmic for
all α, which is unphysical since larger values of α correspond to shorter-range interactions and, therefore, we
expect slower spreading of correlations. In particular, we
expect the light cone to become linear for large enough
α, given that the interactions are finite-range at α = ∞.

3
Gong et al. [23] resolved the first challenge and derived
a bound for two-body interactions:

where µ ∈ (0, 1) is an arbitrary constant. The light cone
implied by this bound is still logarithmic, but the velocity v is finite for all α. Although the bound in Ref. [23]
was derived only for two-body interactions, their proof
applies to arbitrary k-body interactions, where k is a
finite integer [See Appendix A for a proof].

B.

Lieb-Robinson bounds for α > 2D

In this section, we discuss the LR bounds for powerlaw interactions with α > 2D. While the bounds in
Ref. [22, 23] work for α > D, they all have logarithmic
light cones. For α > 2D, it is possible to derive tighter
algebraic light cones. The first such bound was proven
by Foss-Feig et al. [24] for two-body interactions (and
generalized by Refs. [19, 25] to k-body interactions for
all k ≥ 2). A recent bound by Tran et al. [20], however,
gives a tighter algebraic light cone. Here, we provide the
generalization of that bound to k-body interactions:

where r0 is the radius of the smallest ball that contains
X and µ, ξ ∈ (0, 1) are arbitrary constants. The second
term decays exponentially with r/t and becomes negligible compared to the first term when r ≫ t. Note that,
other than its dependence on r0 , this bound is independent of the size of X, Y and is valid for α > 2D.
Before we present the proof of Eq. (4), we summarize
the key steps of the proof:
1. First, divide [0, t] into M equal time intervals and
define t0 , t1 , . . . , tM such that t0 = 0 and tj+1 −
tj = τ = t/M . We denote by Uti ,tj the evolution
unitary of the system from time ti to tj .
2. Setting Uj = UtM −j ,tM −j+1 for brevity, we can decompose the evolution of A into M timesteps:
†
†
A(t) = UM
UM−1
. . . U1† AU1 . . . UM−1 UM .

(5)

3. We then use a truncation technique (explicitly described below) to approximate U1† AU1 by some operator A1 such that
U1† AU1 − A1 = ε1 ,

(6)

and A1 is supported on a ball of size at most ℓ
larger than the size of the support of A.

4. Repeat the above approximation for the other time
slices, i.e. find A2 , . . . , AM such that
U2† A1 U2 − A2 = ε2 ,

(7)

U3† A2 U3 − A3 = ε3 ,

(8)

...
†
UM
AM−1 UM − AM = εM .

(9)

By the end of this process, we have approximated
A(t) by an operator AM whose support is at most
M ℓ larger than the support of A.
5. By choosing M ℓ just smaller than r, the support
of AM does not overlap with the support of B.
Therefore, [AM , B] = 0, and C(t, r) is at most the
total error of the approximation, i.e.
ε = ε1 + · · · + εM .

(10)

The total error ε, and hence the bound, depends on
the truncation technique used in Step 3. In Ref. [20],
the authors used a technique inspired by digital quantum simulation, which works for α > 2D. However, in
addition to truncating the evolution unitary, the technique in Ref. [20] also truncates the Hamiltonian. The
large error from this truncation makes it difficult to further improve the bound. Here, we use a different, simpler
technique to generalize the bound in Ref. [20] to k-body
interactions for all k ≥ 2. Our technique does not require truncating the Hamiltonian, eliminating a hurdle
for future improvements on the bound [26].
Let us start without any assumption on the interactions of the system. We only assume that there already
exists a bound on the commutator norm for the system:
C(t, r) ≤ f (t, r)φ(X) kAk kBk ,

(11)

for some function f that increases with t and decreases
with r, where φ(X) is the boundary area of X.
To truncate U1† AU1 , we simply trace out the part of
†
U1 AU1 that lies outside a ball of radius ℓ around the
support of A [27]:

where Bℓ (A) is a ball of radius ℓ + r0 centered on A and
X c denotes the complement of the set X. In Eq. (13),
we rewrite the trace over Bℓ (A)c as an integral over the
unitaries W supported on Bℓ (A)c and µ(W ) denotes the
Haar measure for the unitaries. Effectively, A1 is the
part of A that lies inside the ball Bℓ (A). The error from

where τ is the time interval of each time slice. In addition, it is clear from the definition of A1 in Eq. (13) that
kA1 k ≤ kAk. Therefore, the error of the approximation
in the j-th time slice is at most
εj ≤ kAk φ(Xj−1 )f (τ, ℓ),

(16)

where Xj is the support of Aj . Thus, the new bound is

f (τ, ℓ) is a decreasing function of ℓ, the bound Eq. (18)

LINEAR RESPONSE THEORY

In this section, we present the derivation of an exponentially suppressed heating rate for periodically driven,
power-law Hamiltonians under the assumptions of linear response theory. We will assume that the drive
V (t) is harmonic and local. That is, we can write
V (t) = g cos(ωt)O, for some small
P constant g and some
time-independent operator O = i Oi composed of local
operators Oi . For simplicity, we assume each Oi is supported on a single site i (but our results also hold when
Oi is supported on a finite number of sites around i).
We also assume the system is initially in a thermal state
ρβ of H0 with a temperature β −1 . Within the linear response theory, the energy absorption rate is proportional
to the dissipative
P (imaginary) part of the response function σ(ω) = i,j σij (ω) [5], where
Z
1 ∞
σij (ω) =
dteiωt h[Oi (t), Oj (0)]iβ ,
(25)
2 −∞
hOiβ ≡ Tr(ρβ O) denotes the thermal average of O, and
O(t) = eiH0 t Oe−iH0 t is the time-evolved version of O
under H0 .

5
The authors of Ref. [5] showed that there exists a constant κ such that for all i, j and for all ω, δω > 0, the
(i, j) entry of σ(ω) can be bounded as
|σij ([ω, ω + δω])| ≤ e−κω ,
(26)
Rω
where f ([ω1 , ω2 ]) ≡ ω12 f (ω)dω. Although the statement of Ref. [5] applies to Hamiltonians with finite-range
interactions, we show in Appendix B 1 that it also holds
for power-law Hamiltonians for all α ≥ 0.
In principle, Eq. (26) already implies that the absorption rate of a finite system is exponentially small as a
function of the frequency ω. However, since there are N
sites in the system, naively applying Eq. (26) by summing over the indices i, j yields a superextensive heating
rate ∼ N 2 e−κω . Such superextensivity is non-physical,
as it would imply that a local drive instigates a divergent absorption per site in the thermodynamic limit. To
address this, Ref. [5] introduced a bound complementary to Eq. (26)—based on Lieb-Robinson bounds for
finite-range interactions [28]—that implies the contribution from the off-diagonal terms is also exponentially
suppressed with the distance rij between the sites i, j.
The case of power-law interacting Hamiltonians is
somewhat more involved. Due to the long-range interaction, the commutator h[Oi (t), Oj ]iβ can decay more
slowly as a function of rij than in the finite-range case.
Fortunately, we show that it still decays sufficiently
quickly for us to recover the extensive, exponentiallysmall heating rate for power-law Hamiltonians. We provide the technical proof in Appendix B 2, but a high-level
argument goes as follows.
Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law systems with
α > D [19, 20, 22, 23] imply that the contributions from
α
the (i, j) entries are suppressed by 1/rij
. Therefore, the
total contribution to σ([ω, ω + δω]) from the pairs (i, j)
with rij larger than some distance r∗ (to be chosen later)
is at most
X
C
CN
(27)
α ≤ α−D ,
rij
r
∗
i,j:rij ≥r∗
where we use the same notation C to denote different
constants that are independent of rij , t, and N . The
factor N comes from summing over i and the factor r∗D
from summing over j at least a distance r∗ from i.
For rij ≤ r∗ , we simply use the bound in Eq. (26) to
bound their contributions:
X
Ce−κω ≤ CN r∗D e−κω ,
(28)
i,j:rij ≤r∗

where N r∗D is roughly the number of pairs (i, j) separated by distances less than r∗ . Combining Eq. (27) with
Eq. (28), we get |σ([ω, ω + δω])| ≤ CN r∗D (e−κω + r∗−α ) .
Finally, choosing r∗ = exp(κω/α), we obtain a bound on
the absorption rate,
 
 
D
|σ([ω, ω + δω])| ≤ CN exp − 1 −

which decays exponentially quickly with ω as long as
α > D. Thus, we have shown that, within the linear response theory, the heating rate of power-law interacting
Hamiltonians obeys a bound that is qualitatively similar to that for finite-range interactions: the heating rate
is extensive, but exponentially small in the driving frequency.

V.

MAGNUS-LIKE EXPANSION

We now present a more general approach to proving
a bound on the heating time in a system governed by a
periodically driven, power-law Hamiltonian. In particular, this approach remains correct for strongly driven
systems, where linear-response theory does not apply.
We generalize Ref. [6] and construct an effective timeindependent Hamiltonian H∗ . The leading terms of H∗
resemble the effective Hamiltonian one would get from
the Magnus expansion [29–31]. Using Lieb-Robinson
bounds for power-law interactions, we show that the evolution of local observables under H∗ well approximates
the exact evolution up to time t∗ , which is exponentially long as a function of the drive frequency. Additionally, the existence of the effective Hamiltonian H∗
also implies a prethermalization window during which
the system could thermalize with respect to H∗ before
eventually heating up after time t∗ .
Following Ref. [6], we construct a periodic unitary
transformation Q(t) such that Q(t + T ) = Q(t) and
Q(0) = I. After moving into the frame rotated by Q(t),
we show that the transformed Hamiltonian is nearly
time-independent and the norm of the residual timedependent part is exponentially small as a function of
the frequency.
To construct the unitary Q(t), we note that the state
of the system in the rotated frame, |φ(t)i = Q† (t) |ψ(t)i,
obeys the Schrödinger equation with a transformed
Hamiltonian H ′ (t) (~ = 1):
i∂t |φ(t)i = (Q† HQ − iQ† ∂t Q) |φ(t)i ≡ H ′ (t) |φ(t)i .
(30)
We write Q = eΩ , where Ω(t) is a periodic, antiHermitian operator, i.e. Ω(t) = Ω(t + T ) and Ω† = −Ω.
We then assume that the
P∞period T is small so that we
may expand Ω(t) =
q=1 Ωq in orders of T , where
kΩq k = O (T q ), and we will eventually choose Ωq such
that the transformed Hamiltonian H ′ (t) is almost timeindependent. In particular, we shall truncate the expansion of Ω(t) up to order qmax and choose Ωq recursively
for all q ≤ qmax to minimize the norm of the driving term
in H ′ (t).
We can rewrite H ′ (t) from Eq. (30) as:
H ′ (t) = e−adΩ [H0 + V (t)] − i

1 − e−adΩ
∂t Ω,
adΩ

(31)

with adΩ A = [Ω, A]. From Eq. (31), we can define Hq′ (t)
P∞
for q = 0, 1, . . . such that H ′ = q=0 Hq′ (t) is expanded

6
in powers of T :
Hq′ (t) = Gq (t) − i∂t Ωq+1 (t),

(32)

where we define Gq via Ω1 , . . . , Ωq as follows:

Here, Eq. (35) ensures that Eq. (32) becomes

Ωq+1 (t) = 0, so that Hq′ (t) = Gq (t). By this construction, we can rewrite the transformed Hamiltonian into

Observe that for any order q, the last two bounds, i.e.
Eq. (38) and Eq. (39), follow immediately from Eq. (37)
and the definition of Ωq . Note that Lemma 1 holds for
(1)
G0 (t) = H(t) ∈ Hα . It is also straightforward to prove
Lemma 1 inductively on q. The factor T q comes from the
constraint in Eq. (33) that i1 + · · · + ik = q, along with
the fact that each Ωiν is O(T iν ) for all ν = 1, . . . , k.
Similarly, the factor of q! is combinatorial and comes
from the nested commutators in Eq. (33). We provide a
more technical proof of Lemma 1 in Appendix C.
As a consequence of Lemma 1, we can bound the local
norms of the operators:

Gq (t),

(36)

{z

≡V ′ (t)

}

As a result of the transformation, the driving term
V ′ (t) is now O(T qmax ). As discussed before, we will eventually choose the cutoff qmax to minimize the norm of the
residual drive kV ′ (t)k.
To estimate the norm of V ′ (t), elucidating its dependence on qmax , we first need more information on the
structure of the Ωq (t) for all 1 ≤ q ≤ qmax . In particular, we show that Gq and Ωq are power-law interacting
Hamiltonians. To do so, we first need to define some
more notation. We denote by Hα the set of power-law
Hamiltonians with exponent α and a local energy scale
(k)
η = 1. In addition, we denote by Hα the subset of
Hα which contains all power-law Hamiltonians whose local support size [see Definition 1] is at most k + 1. For
a real positive constant a, we also denote by aHα the

There are two competing factors in the bounds: T q ,
which decreases with q, and q! ∼ q q , which increases with
q. This suggests that the optimal choice for qmax —in order to minimize the local norm in Eq. (40)—should be
around e/(cT λ). In the following, we shall choose
qmax = ω∗ ≡

and G0 (t)=H(t). Now, recall that Ωq (t) are operators
that we can choose. From Eq. (32), we choose Ω1 (t) such
that it cancels out the time-dependent part of G0 (t),
making H0′ time-independent. This choice of Ω1 (t) also
defines G1 (t). We then choose Ω2 (t) to eliminate the
time-dependent part of G1 (t). In general, we choose
Ωq successively from q = 1 to some q = qmax (to be
specified later) so that Hq′ are time-independent for all
q < qmax . Therefore, the remaining time-dependent part
of the transformed Hamiltonian H ′ (t) must be at least
O(T qmax ). Specifically, for q < qmax , we choose the following:

The following lemma says that Gq and Ωq are also

for all q < qmax = ω∗ . By summing over Gq with q < ω∗ ,
we find that the effective time-independent Hamiltonian
H∗ [see Eq. (36)] is also a power-law Hamiltonian, i.e.
(q

H∗ ∈ CHα max ∈ CHα , up to a constant C that may
depend only on κ.
Similarly, we find from Eq. (39) that Ωq ∈
(q)
e/(cλ)e−κq Hα for all q ≤ ω∗ . Plugging into the definition of Gq and noting that we choose Ωq = 0 for all
q ≥ qmax , we find an identity similar to Eq. (43), but for
q ≥ ω∗ :

Gq ∈ Ce−κ q Hα ,

where κ′ > κ − ln 2 is a constant. Summing over Gq with
q ≥ qmax [see Eq. (36)], we again find that the residual
drive V ′ (t) is a power-law Hamiltonian up to a prefactor
that decays exponentially with ω∗ :
′

V ′ (t) ∈ Ce−κ ω∗ Hα ,

(45)

where C and κ′ are some positive constants. As a result,
the local norm of V ′ (t) decreases exponentially with ω∗ :
′
kV ′ (t)kl ≤ Cλe−κ ω∗ .
As discussed earlier, Eq. (36) and Eq. (45) imply the
existence of an effective time-independent Hamiltonian
H∗ such that the difference Q† HQ − H∗ = kV ′ k is
exponentially small as a function of ω∗ ∝ 1/T . However,
even if kV ′ kl is exponentially small, kV ′ k still diverges in
the thermodynamic limit. Therefore, in order to characterize the heating rate of the Hamiltonian, it is necessary
to investigate the evolution of a local observable O under
H(t). We show that the evolution is well described by
the effective time-independent Hamiltonian H∗ at stroboscopic times t = T Z. Without loss of generality, we
assume the local observable O is supported on a single
site and kOk = 1. Following a similar technique used
in Abanin et al. [6], we write the difference between the
approximate evolution under the effective Hamiltonian
and the exact evolution (in the rotated frame):
δ = Q(t)U † (t)OU (t)Q† (t) − eitH∗ Oe−itH∗

time s to t generated by H ′ (t). We can then bound the
norm of the difference using the triangle inequality:

We can bound the right-hand side of Eq. (46) using LiebRobinson bounds for power-law interactions.
First, we provide an intuitive explanation why the
norm of δ is small for small time. Recall that the operator O is initially localized on a single site. At small
time, it is still quasilocal and therefore significantly noncommutative with only a small number of terms of V ′
lying inside the “light cone” generated by the evolution
under H∗ . There are several Lieb-Robinson bounds for
power-law interactions [19, 20, 23, 24] [see also Eq. (A13)
and Eq. (4)], each provides a different estimate for the
shape of the light cone, resulting in a different bound for
the heating time.
If the light cone is logarithmic (as bounded in
Ref. [23]), the commutator norm in Eq. (46) would grow
exponentially quickly with time and eventually negate
the exponentially-small factor exp(−κ′ ω∗ ) from kV ′ kl .
Therefore, in such cases, the system could potentially
heat up only after t∗ ∝ ω∗ = 1/T . On the other hand,

if we use the Lieb-Robinson bounds that imply algebraic light cones (as in Refs. [19, 20, 24] for α > 2D),
the commutator norm only grows subexponentially with
time, and we can expect ′ to recover the exponentiallylong heating time t∗ ∝ eκ ω∗ derived for finite-range interactions [6, 7].
Appendix D contains the mathematical details, but
the results of this analysis are as follows. Using Gong et
al. [23] [or its k-body generalization Eq. (A12)], which
holds for α > D and has a logarithmic light cone t &
log r, yields:
′

kδk ≤ Ce−κ ω∗ e2Dvt/α .

(47)

Thus, the difference δ is only small for time t∗ ∝ ω∗ ∝
1/T . This behavior is expected because the region inside
the light cone implied by Gong et al. ’s bound expands
exponentially quickly with time.
If instead we use the bound in Else et al. [19], we find:
′

kδk ≤ Ce−κ ω∗ ξ



(48)

where ξ(x) ≡ x1 2x Γ(x) and Γ is the Gamma function. Thus, the difference is small up to an exponen1−σ
′
tially long time
t∗ ∝ eκ ω∗ D+1−σ . The result holds for

α > D 1 + σ1 , where σ can be chosen arbitrarily close
to 1. This condition is effectively equivalent to α > 2D
[see Appendix D for a discussion of the limit σ → 1− ].
We may also use the bound in Tran et al. [20] [see
Eq. (24) for its generalization to k-body interactions],
which gives
′

kδk ≤ Ce−κ ω∗ t

D(α−D)
α−2D +1

.

(49)

Thus, the difference
 is small up to an exponentiallyα−2D
. This analysis
long time t∗ ∝ exp κ′ ω∗ α(D+1)−D(D+2)
works only when α > 3D, but, within this regime, the
exponent of the heating time using this bound is larger
than obtained in Eq. (48). This is due to the trade-off
between the tail and the light cone between the bounds
in Refs. [19, 20]. See Appendix D for more details.
Finally, we conjecture a tight bound for power-law interactions that holds for all α > D, and we will provide
the full derivation of δ for such a bound. First, we consider the light cone of such a bound. Given the best
known protocols for quantum information transfer [32],
the best light cone we could hope for would be t & rα−D
for D + 1 > α > D and linear for α > D + 1. In the
following, we assume the light cone of the conjectured
bound is t & r1/β for some constant β ≥ 1 for all α > D.
Next, we consider the tail of the bound, i.e. how the
conjectured bound decays with the distance at a fixed
time. Since it is always possible to signal between two
sites using their direct interaction, which is of strength
1/rα , the tail of the bound cannot decay faster than
1/rα . We shall assume that the bound decays with the
distance exactly as 1/rα .

For simplicity, we assume that the conjectured bound

which manifestly has a light cone t & r1/β and decays as

boundary and consider the sum inside and outside the
light cone.

For convenience, denote V ′′ = C −1 eκ ω∗ V ′ , H̄ ′′ =

it follows that kVr′′ (t)k ≤ CrD−1 . Writing the sum this
way, we can now separate terms inside and outside of
the light cone.
For the terms inside the light cone, we bound:

best values we can hope for β are β = 1/(α − D) when
D + 1 > α > D and β = 1 when α > D + 1. Note
also that the exponential heating time would hold for all
α > D, matching the result given by the linear response
theory.

CONCLUSION & OUTLOOK

Our work generalizes the results of Refs. [5–7] for
finite-range interactions to power-law interactions. Using two independent approaches, we show that periodically driven, power-law systems with a large enough exponent α can only heat up after time that is exponentially long in the drive frequency. The results only hold
if α is larger than some critical value αc . Physically,
the existence of αc coincides with our expectation that
power-law interactions with a large enough exponent α
are effectively short-range.
However, the two approaches imply different values for
αc . While both the Magnus expansion in Ref. [8] and the
Magnus-like expansion in this paper independently suggest αc = 2D, the linear response theory implies αc = D.
We conjecture that this gap is due to the lack of tighter
Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law interactions, especially for α between D and 2D. Indeed, we demonstrated
in Section V that a tight Lieb-Robinson bound for this
range of α implies an exponentially-long heating time
for all α > D, matching the result from the linear response approach, as well as previous numerical evidence
for systems with α < 2D [18]. Therefore, proving a tight
Lieb-Robinson bound has important implications for the
heating time of power-law interacting systems.
Note added.—During the preparation of this
manuscript, we became aware of a related complementary work on long-range prethermal phases [33]. We
also became aware of a tighter Lieb-Robinson bound for
power-law interactions [34]. However, the bound has a
range of validity α > 2 in one dimension and, thus, does
not close the aforementioned gap.

Appendix A: Generalization of Gong et al. [23] to
many-body interactions

In this section, we prove Eq. (3) and thereby generalize the bound in Gong et al. [23] from two-body to
k-body interactions, where k is an arbitrary finite integer. This bound is an ingredient in the generalization of
the tighter Lieb-Robinson bound in Tran et al. [20] to
k-body interactions.
Proof. We recall that the bound in Ref. [23] is based on

A feature of Eq. (A11) is that it depends on |X| , |Y |,

bounds. Without any other assumptions, summing over

Appendix B: Absorption rate from linear response
theory

This section provides more details on the derivation of
the absorption rate within linear response theory. In particular, we provide more mathematically rigorous proofs
of Eq. (26) [Appendix B 1] and Eq. (29) [Appendix B 2].
1.

Proof of Eq. (26)

In this section, we prove the statement of Eq. (26) [also
Eq. (B2) below]. We recall that the system Hamiltonian
H0 is a power-law Hamiltonian, while the harmonic drive
V (t) = g cos(ωt)O is a sum of local terms, g cos(ωt)Oi ,
each of which is supported on the site i only, where i runs
over the sites of the system. In addition, we assume that
the system is initially in the equilibrium state ρβ of H0
corresponding to the temperature 1/β. To the lowest
order in g, the energy absorption rate of the system is
proportional to the dissipative
P (imaginary) part of the
response function, σ(ω) = i,j σij (ω), where i, j are the
sites of the system and
Z
1 ∞
σij (ω) =
dteiωt h[Oi (t), Oj (0)]iβ ,
(B1)
2 −∞
where hXiβ ≡ Tr(ρβ X) denotes the expectation value of
an operator X in ρβ .
In Ref. [5], the authors proved that there exists constants C, κ such that for all ω > 0, δω > 0 and for all
pairs i, j,
|σij ([ω, ω + δω])| ≤ Ce−κω .

(B2)

The statement in Ref. [5] is for finite-range interactions,
but, for completeness, we show here that it also holds for
power-law Hamiltonians. First, we consider the diagonal

where pn is the probability that the state is in the eigen(n)
state |ni, and γii denotes the contribution to σii from
the n-th eigenstate:

δ(En − Em − ω), (B4)

where adH Oi = [H, Oi ], k is an integer to be chosen later,
and the last equality comes from the fact that |mi , |ni
are eigenstates of H and the δ function fixes the energy
difference to be ω.
In Ref. [5], the authors used the fact that H has a finite range to upper bound the norm of adkH Oi by λk k! for
some constant λ. For power-law interactions, the proof
does not apply because the Hamiltonian H can contain
interaction terms between arbitrarily far sites. Instead,
we upper bound adkH Oi by realizing that Oi technically
satisfies Definition 1 and is therefore a power-law Hamiltonian. It then follows from Lemma 3 in Appendix E
that adkH Oi ∈ λk k!Hα , i.e. adkH Oi is a power-law Hamiltonian up to a factor λk k!, where λ is the same constant
as in Lemma 3 and Hα is the set of power-law Hamiltonians with exponent α [See Appendix E 1]. Finally, we
can upper bound
adkH Oi ≤ Cλk k!,

(B5)

by realizing that the supports of the terms in adkH Oi all
contain the site i.
Integrating Eq. (B4) over ω, assuming δω is small
enough so that the number of energy levels in the range
[ω, ω + δω] is finite, and using Eq. (B5), we have

(B6)

where κ = 2/(λe) and, to get the last line, we choose
k = ω/(λe). Plugging this bound into Eq. (B3) and
summing over n yields Eq. (26) for i = j. The bound
for i 6= j can be derived using the positivity of σ [5] and
the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality,
|σij (ω)| ≤

1
[σii (ω) + σjj (ω)].
2

(B7)

Therefore, Eq. (26) applies for all power-law Hamiltonians H.

12
2.

Proof of Eq. (29)

We now provide a rigorous proof of Eq. (29) in the
main text. Equation (B2) says that the (i, j) entry of
σ([ω, ω + δω]) is exponentially suppressed. In principle,
summing over all i, j implies that σ([ω, ω + δω]) is also
exponentially small as a function of ω. However, since
there are N sites in the system, this summation results
in an additional factor of N 2 , making σ([ω, ω + δω]) superextensive. Therefore, this naive calculation breaks
down in the thermodynamic limit (N → ∞).
Instead, to show that σ([ω, ω + δω]) increases only as
fast as N , we use Lieb-Robinson bounds to bound the
off-diagonal terms σij (ω). Let rij = dist(i, j) denote the
distance between the pair of sites i, j. Without loss of
generality, we assume ω ≥ 2δω. We can then bound

for α > D, where the factor of N comes from summing
over i and the factor of rD comes from summing over j.
On the other hand, for rij ≤ r∗ , we simply use
Eq. (B2) to bound their contributions. Summing over i, j
such that rij ≤ r∗ , we get a bound CN r∗D e−κω , where
the factor of N again comes from summing over i and the
factor of r∗D from counting the number of sites j within
a distance r∗ from i. Combining with Eq. (B10) yields
an upper bound on the the total heating rate

where c1 = 1−ee −8 , c2 = c1 π/2, which we will combine
and denote by C, and δt = 2/δω. The first inequality is
because σ(ω) is positive for ω > 0 and σ(−ω) = −σ(ω).
The second equality comes from evaluating the integral over ω ′ . We then use the Lieb-Robinson bound in
Ref. [23], which applies for interactions with characteristic exponent α > D:

was derived in Ref. [23] for 2-body interactions, it also
holds for more general k-body interactions and thus for
fully general power-law Hamiltonians [see Eq. (A11)].
We now divide the sum in Eq. (B8) into two parts
corresponding to rij > r∗ and rij ≤ r∗ for some parameter r∗ we shall choose later. The sum over i, j such
that rij > r∗ can then be bounded by first inserting
Eq. (B9) into Eq. (B8) and evaluating the integration

In this section, we study the structure of the effective
Hamiltonian defined in Eq. (36). Specifically, we show
that the operators Gq defined in Eq. (33) are also powerlaw Hamiltonians [See also Lemma 1 in the main text for
q < qmax and Lemma 2 below for q ≥ qmax ]. In addition,
we show that the norm Gq for q ≥ qmax is exponentially
small as a function of q and ω∗ [Lemma 2], implying that
the norm of the residual drive V ′ is also exponentially
small.

1.

Structure of Gq for q < qmax

First, we prove the statement of Lemma 1 that the
operators Gq are also power-law Hamiltonians for all q <
qmax .
Proof. We proceed by induction and assume that
Lemma 1 holds for all q up to q = q0 − 1 for some q0 ≥ 1.
We now prove that it also holds for q = q0 . We consider
the first term in the definition of Gq0 [Eq. (33)]:

Note that c1 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a
larger value for c. Therefore, with c large enough so that
3c1 < 1, we have that Lemma 1 holds for q = q0 .

Structure of Gq for q ≥ qmax

We now prove Eq. (44), which is a similar result to
Lemma 1, but for q ≥ qmax = ω∗ .
′

Lemma 2. For all q ≥ qmax = ω∗ , Gq ∈ Ce−κ q Hα ,
where C and κ′ are constants.

Combining Eq. (C14) and Eq. (C17), we arrive at
Lemma 2 with κ′ = κ − ln 2 − 1/c, which can be made to
be positive by choosing κ > ln 2 + 1/c. It suffices, however, to choose κ > ln 2, since making c large enough
sends 1/c to zero. Equation (45) also follows.

(C9)
We also recall from Lemma 1 that for all q ≤ ω∗ ,

Appendix D: Using Lieb-Robinson bounds for
evolutions of local observables

In this section, we use the Lieb-Robinson bounds to
bound the norm of δ in Eq. (46). In the main text, we argue that kδ(t)k would be small up to time t∗ ∝ ω∗ if the
light cone induced by
the Lieb-Robinson bound is loga′
rithmic, and t∗ ∝ eκ ω∗ if the light cone is algebraic. We
provide below the mathematical details to supplement
the argument.
′
Recall that V ′ (t) ∈ Ce−κ ω∗ Hα , H∗ ∈ γHα (γ is a constant that depends only on κ, α) and that we defined the
′
normalized V ′′ = C −1 eκ ω∗ V, H̄ ′′ = γ −1 H∗ such that:

We now use a Lieb-Robinson bound for power-law interactions to bound the commutator. The idea is that for
a finite time s, the operator O mostly spreads within a
light cone, and only the terms of V ′′ (s) within the light
cone significantly contribute to the commutator.
In contrast to the finite-range interacting Hamiltonians, a tight Lieb-Robinson bound has yet to be proven
for power-law Hamiltonians with finite α > D. In the following sections, we consider the effect of using different
Lieb-Robinson bounds, namely the bounds in Gong et
al. [23], Else et al. [19], Tran et al. [20]. The case of
a hypothetical bound, which would be tight if it were
proven, is treated in the main text.

First, we consider a generalization of the bound in
Gong et al. [23] [See also Eq. (A12)]. The bound holds
for α > D, has a logarithmic light cone t & log r, and is
extended to many-body interactions. To bound the com′′
mutator
norm in Eq. (51), recall
P∞
P that we write V (s) =
′′
′′
X:dist(X,O)∈[r,r+1) hX der=0 Vr (s), where Vr (s) ≡
notes the terms of V ′′ (s) supported on subsets exactly a
distance between r and r + 1 away from O. furthermore,
since V ′′ (s) is a power-law Hamiltonian, it follows that
kVr′′ (t)k ≤ CrD−1 .
From Eq. (A12), the light cone of the bound is r∗ (s) =
evs/α . We further divide Vr′′ (s) into those with r ≤ r∗ (s)

15
and r > r∗ (s). In the former case, we simply bound:

than 1 when α > 2D. The former light cone, i.e. t &
r1−σ , is therefore looser and thus dominates the latter.
In the rest of the calculation, we take r∗ (t) = t1/(1−σ) to
be the light cone boundary.
Similar to Eq. (D2), we get an upper bound for the
terms inside the light cone:

For the latter case, we use Eq. (A12) to bound the
commutator norm:

where we use the same C to denote different constants
that may depend on µ, α. Note that while the bound in
Eq. (A12) is valid for α > D, the sum over r converges
only when α > 2D.
Plugging Eq. (D2) and Eq. (D7) into Eq. (51) and
integrating over s, we have
′

kδk ≤ Ce−κ ω∗ e2Dvt/α ,

(D8)

which is the result presented in Section V. Again, δ is
only small for up to time t∗ ∝ ω∗ ∝ 1/T , which is expected because the region inside the light cone implied
by this bound expands exponentially fast with time.
2.

Using Else et al. [19]’s bound

Instead of using Gong et al. ’s bound, we now use the
bound in Else et al. [19], which already holds for manybody interactions. The bound states that when |X| = 1,

heating time for α as small as possible, we need the algebraic tail exponent σ(α − D) to be as large as possible.
So we will assume that we pick some σ very close to 1.
First, let us look at the light cone generated by
Eq. (D9). The first term of the bound gives a light cone

Using Tran et al. [20]’s bound

Appendix E: Mathematical preliminaries

In addition to Else et al. [19]’s bound, we can also
use the bound in Tran et al. [20] [see also Eq. (24)
for a generalization to k-body interactions], which also
works for α > 2D. Compared to the bound in Else et
al. , the bound in Tran et al. has a tighter light cone
r∗ (s) = s(α−D)/(α−2D) , but it decays with the distance
r as rα−2D , slower than the tail rσ(α−D) in Else et
al. when σ > (α − 2D)/(α − D).
Similar to before, we further divide Vr′′ (s) into those
with r ≤ r∗ (s) and r > r∗ (s). For the terms inside the
light cone, we again bound:

Properties of the set Hα of power-law
Hamiltonians

In this section, we explore some properties of Hα that
are useful for proving that the effective Hamiltonian is
also power-law [See Appendix C].
We recall from the main text that Hα is the set of
power-law Hamiltonians with the exponent α. In addi(k)
tion, Hα is the subset of Hα which contains all powerlaw Hamiltonians whose local support size [see Definition 1] is at most k +1. For a real positive constant a, we
also denote by aHα the set of Hamiltonians H such that
a−1 H is a power-law Hamiltonian with the exponent α.
It is straightforward to prove the following identities:

This section contains mathematical details omitted

we discuss the properties of the set of power-law Hamiltonians defined in Definition 1. In Appendix E 2, we
present some bounds on discrete sums.

(D15)

Thus, the difference is small up to an exponentially long
α−2D
′
time t∗ ∝ eκ ω∗ α(D+1)−D(D+2) . Compared to using Else et
al. ’s bound, this analysis works only when α > 3D.
However, within this regime, the exponent of the heating
time using this bound is larger than using Else et al. .
This is a manifestation of the trade-off between the tail
and the light cone when switching from Else et al. to
Tran et al. bound.

PNote that hZ 6= 0 only if X ∩Y 6= ∅. We seek to bound
Z∋i,j khZ k which sums over Z = X ∪ Y ∋ i, j and
X ∩ Y 6= ∅. We discuss some useful notations. We will
occasionally rewrite or label summations with restrictions using the indicator function ξ(A) where ξ(A) = 1, 0
if A is true, false respectively. There are 9 mutually exclusive cases [Table I], satisfying i, j ∈ X ∪ Y depending
on whether i, j are in X, Y , or both.
Thus, the indicator function ξ(X ∪ Y ∋ i, j) may be
written as a sum of indicator functions of mutually
P9exclusive events listed in the table: ξ(X∪Y ∋ i, j) = n=1 ξn .
The overall sum that we want to bound can be written

switches the roles of i, j.
Finally, we bound the terms corresponding to ξ4 , ξ9 .
For ξ4 , we are trying to bound the sum:

which can only make the sum larger, and introduce an
inequality by summing over all sets X or Y . To illustrate
our technique, consider first the contribution from ξ5 :

where we take into account dist(i, j) ≥ 1 for all D.
Upper bounding the term corresponding to ξ6 is a bit
trickier. Since X ∩ Y 6= ∅, there exists a site ℓ 6= i, j
such that ℓ ∈ X ∩ Y . Rewriting the term corresponding

2 kaX k kbY k ξ(X ∩ Y 6= ∅).

(E8)

The non-empty intersection means that for there to be
a nonzero contribution, ∃ℓ 6= i, j such that ℓ ∈ X, Y .
Further note that by assumption the maximum extent
of X is k1 + 1 and therefore there are at most k1 − 1
sites distinct from i, j where Y can intersect with X.
We bound this as follows:

kaX k kbY k

where the first inequality comes from ignoring j ∈
/ X and
the second comes from H2 being a power-law Hamiltonian.
The bound on the term corresponding to ξ7 follows
analogously since we simply switch i, j. Similarly, the
terms corresponding to ξ2 , ξ3 switch only the roles of
X, Y compared to ξ5 , ξ7 . Meanwhile, analyzing the term
corresponding to ξ1 yields:
