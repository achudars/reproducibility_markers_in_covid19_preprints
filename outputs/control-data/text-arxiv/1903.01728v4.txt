ABSTRACT

1

Emotion plays an important role in detecting fake news online.
When leveraging emotional signals, the existing methods focus on
exploiting the emotions of news contents that conveyed by the publishers (i.e., publisher emotion). However, fake news often evokes
high-arousal or activating emotions of people, so the emotions of
news comments aroused in the crowd (i.e., social emotion) should
not be ignored. Furthermore, it remains to be explored whether
there exists a relationship between publisher emotion and social
emotion (i.e., dual emotion), and how the dual emotion appears in
fake news. In this paper, we verify that dual emotion is distinctive
between fake and real news and propose Dual Emotion Features to
represent dual emotion and the relationship between them for fake
news detection. Further, we exhibit that our proposed features can
be easily plugged into existing fake news detectors as an enhancement. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (one in
English and the others in Chinese) show that our proposed feature
set: 1) outperforms the state-of-the-art task-related emotional features; 2) can be well compatible with existing fake news detectors
and effectively improve the performance of detecting fake news.1 2

In recent years, fake news on social media has threatened not only
cyberspace security, but also the real-world order in politics [14],
economy [12], society [2], etc. The most recent example is the
concomitant infodemic during the COVID-19 pandemic across the
world [41]. Thousands of news pieces with misleading content have
been spreading through social media [44] and led to socio-economic
disorder [6] and weakened the effect of pandemic prevention [4].
To tackle this issue, researchers have been devoted to developing
automatic methods to detect fake news (i.e., designing a classifier
to judge a given news piece as real or fake) by leveraging signals
from text [5, 32, 34], images [20, 35], or social contexts [17, 24, 26–
28, 39, 40]. 3
In existing text-based works [1, 5, 15], the role of sentimental
or emotional signals has been considered for fake news detection.
Ajao et al. [1] point out that there exists a relationship between
news veracity and the sentiments of the posted text, and append a
sentimental feature (the ratio of the number of negative and positive
words) to help text-only fake news detectors. Instead of appending a
sole feature, Giachanou et al. [15] extract richer emotional features
from the news contents based on emotional lexicons for fake news
detection. To the best of our knowledge, most existing works leverage the emotional signals of fake news content conveyed by the
publishers but rarely focus on the emotions of fake news comments
aroused in the crowd. However, for spreading in the crowd virally,
fake news often evokes high-arousal or activating emotions of the
crowd [37]. Therefore, in addition to emotions of news contents,
it is necessary to explore whether emotions of news comments
and the relationship between the two emotions are helpful for fake
news detection.
To describe the two emotions clearly, we define them respectively
as 1) publisher emotion: the emotions conveyed by publishers of
the news pieces; and 2) social emotion: the emotions aroused in
the crowd facing to the news pieces. And we adopt dual emotion
as a general term of these two emotions. For a news piece, dual

relationship in dual emotion can be indicative of the news veracity
and should be considered when modeling.
To model the dual emotion and emotion resonances and dissonances for fake news detection, we propose Dual Emotion Features to represent publisher emotion, social emotion and the similarity
and difference of the dual emotion jointly. Besides, it is convenient to
implement and plug the features into existing fake news detectors
as an enhancement.
In this paper, our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We propose and verify that the dual emotion (i.e., publisher
emotion and social emotion) signal is distinctive between fake
and real news.
• We firstly propose the feature set, Dual Emotion Features, to
comprehensively represent dual emotion and the relationship between the two kinds of emotions, and exhibit how
to plug it into the fake news detectors as a complement and
enhancement.
• We conduct experiments on the real-world datasets, including a newly-constructed Chinese dataset. The results demonstrate that: 1) Dual Emotion Features outperforms the existing
emotional features for fake news detection. 2) It can be compatible with existing fake news detectors and effectively
improve the performance of the detectors.

emotion has two appearances: emotion resonances (i.e., the publisher emotion is same or similar to the social emotion) and emotion
dissonances (i.e., the publisher emotion is different from the social
emotion). We analyze the data and find that the two appearances
have a statistically significant distinction between fake and real
news (see details in Section 4.2). For example, as to the emotion
resonance, there are more fake news pieces whose dual emotion are

more fake news pieces whose publisher emotion is happy while

RELATED WORK

Fake news detection is also known as false news detection, rumor detection, misinformation detection, etc. [33] and is closely
connected to the field of information credibility evaluation. In the
earliest study on information credibility evaluation, Castillo et al.
[5] manually extract content features, publisher features, topic features, and propagation features from news pieces. And the work
finds that sentiment-based features like the fraction of sentimental
words and exclamation marks are effective for evaluating information credibility. In recent years, researchers begin to utilize deep
learning models such as GRU-based and CNN-based models for
fake news detection [26, 47]. Beyond news content, social contexts
such as texts of comments and reposts [17, 26–28, 38], viewpoints
and stances of the crowd [19, 22], and user credibility[24, 40] are
emphasized as well.
There are also existing works focusing on discovering the distinctive emotional signals between fake and real news. Ajao et al. [1]
verify that there exists a relationship between news veracity (real
or fake) and the usage of sentimental words, and design an emotion
feature (the ratio of the count of negative and positive words) to
help detect fake news. Besides, Giachanou et al. [15] extract emotion features based on emotional lexicons from news contents for
fake news detection. However, these works only leverage the emotional signals of fake news contents but ignore the emotions of fake
news comments and the relationship between the two emotions.
Recently, Wu and Rao [45] propose an adaptive fusion network for
fake news detection, modeling emotion embeddings from the contents and the comments. However, this work focuses on adaptively
fusing various features by advanced deep learning models, and do
not explore the specific distinction of dual emotion signals between
fake and real news. So far, the work that pays attention to mining
dual emotion signals from publishers and crowds remains vacant.

MODELING DUAL EMOTION FOR FAKE
NEWS DETECTION

To model dual emotion signals for fake news detection, we propose
Dual Emotion Features, which can leverage publisher emotion, social emotion, and the similarity and difference of the dual emotion.
Figure 2 exhibits the process of obtaining Dual Emotion Features and
integrating them into an existing fake news detector as an enhancement to classify a given piece of news. In this section, we detail the
feature extraction of publisher emotion and social emotion, and the
modeling of emotion gap. Then, we describe the process to plug
Dual Emotion Featuresinto the existing fake news detectors.

3.1

Publisher Emotion

To comprehensively represent the Publisher Emotion, we use a variety of features extracted from news contents, including the emotion
category, emotional lexicon, emotional intensity, sentiment score,
and other auxiliary features. In the five kinds of features, emotion
category, emotional intensity and sentiment score provide the overall information and the other two provide word- and symbol-level
information.
Given the input sequence of the textual content with length 𝐿,
T = [𝑡 1, 𝑡 2, . . . , 𝑡𝑖 , . . . , 𝑡𝐿 ], where 𝑡𝑖 is the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ word in the text, the
goal is to extract emotion features 𝑒𝑚𝑜 T from the text T .
3.1.1 Emotion Category. We use public emotion classifiers (which
will be introduced in Section 4.2) to get emotion category features.
Usually, the output of an emotion classifier is the probabilities that
the given text contains certain emotions.
Given the emotion classifier 𝑓 and the text T , we assume the
dimension of the output is 𝑑 𝑓 and thus the prediction of the text is

𝑓 (T ). So we can obtain the emotion category features 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒
=
T
𝑓 (T ), where 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒
∈ R𝑑 𝑓 .
T
3.1.2 Emotional Lexicon. Usually, a piece of text conveys specific
emotions by using several specific words (which are generally included in emotional lexicons). Thus, we next extract the features
based on the emotional lexicon. The approach is dependent on the
existing emotion dictionaries annotated by experts. In the emotion
dictionary, we assume that there are 𝑑𝑒 kinds of emotions, denoted
as 𝐸 = {𝑒 1, 𝑒 2, . . . , 𝑒𝑑𝑒 }. For the emotion 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸, the dictionary provides a list of emotional words E𝑒 = {𝑤𝑒,1, 𝑤𝑒,2, . . . , 𝑤𝑒,𝐿𝑒 }, where
𝐿𝑒 is the length of the emotion lexicon of 𝑒 in the dictionary.
Given the text T , we gradually aggregate the scores of each
word and the whole text across all the emotions for rich representation. For one of the emotions 𝑒, we firstly calculate the word-level
score 𝑠 (𝑡𝑖 , 𝑒), where 𝑡𝑖 is 𝑖 𝑡ℎ word in the text T . If the word 𝑡𝑖 is in
the dictionary E𝑒 , we consider not only its occurrence frequency,
but also its contextual words (specifically, degree words and negation words). For example, in the sentence “I am not very joyful
today” (the length of the sentence is 6), “joyful” belongs to the
emotion happy and its occurrence frequency is 1/6. Assume that
we only consider the left context and the window size is 2 (i.e., the
context words are “not” and “very”). When we set the negation
value of “not” as -1 and the degree value of “very” as 2, the final
𝑠 ( 𝑗𝑜𝑦𝑓 𝑢𝑙, 𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑦 ) = −1 ∗ 2 ∗ (1/6) = −1/3. In practice, we use the
existing emotion dictionary to match and calculate the values of
negation and degree words. As described above, 𝑠 (𝑡𝑖 , 𝑒) is defined
in Equation 1:

𝑠 (𝑡𝑖 , 𝑒) =

1E𝑒 (𝑡𝑖 ) ∗ 𝑛𝑒𝑔(𝑡𝑖 , 𝑤) ∗ 𝑑𝑒𝑔(𝑡𝑖 , 𝑤)
𝐿

where 𝑤 is the window size of the left context. And 𝑛𝑒𝑔(𝑡 𝑗 )
(Equation 3) and 𝑑𝑒𝑔(𝑡 𝑗 ) (Equation 4) are respectively the negation
value and degree value of 𝑡 𝑗 , which can be looked up according to
the emotion dictionary.

3.1.5 Other Auxiliary Features. Considering that the above features do not explicitly exploit the information beyond emotion
dictionaries, we introduce a set of auxiliary features to capture the
emotional signals behind the non-word elements, including emoticons, punctuations, and uppercase letters (only for English). Also,
we add the frequency of sentimental words and personal pronouns
to enhance the awareness of the users’ word usages. Take emoticons as an example. The emoticons are universal for emotional
expression across the world, such as “: )” for ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑦, “: (” for 𝑠𝑎𝑑. Besides, punctuations like “!” and “?” can also convey people’s moods
and emotions. Table 1 summarizes the auxiliary features used in
the Dual Emotion Features. Assume that there are 𝑑𝑎 features, and
we can extract the other auxiliary features 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑎𝑢𝑥
∈ R𝑑𝑎 .
T

𝑗=𝑖−𝑤

We then calculate text-level score on the specific emotion 𝑒,
denoted as 𝑠 (T , 𝑒), by summing the scores of each word in the text,
as Equation 5 shows:
𝑠 (T , 𝑒) =

Finally, the emotional lexicon features 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑙𝑒𝑥

⊕ is the concatenation operator, and 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑙𝑒𝑥

T = 𝑠 (T , 𝑒 1 ) ⊕ 𝑠 (T , 𝑒 2 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ 𝑠 (T , 𝑒𝑑𝑒 )

3.1.3 Emotional Intensity. As for emotional lexicons, we also consider the emotional intensity of the lexicons. For example, when
expressing the emotion ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑦, the word “ecstatic” owns a higher
intensity than “joyful”. The extracting process is similar to that of
the emotional lexicon features, except for that we here include the
intensity scores. Given the emotions 𝐸, the emotional word list E𝑒
for every emotion 𝑒, and the text T , we first calculate the intensityaware text-level scores 𝑠 ′ (T , 𝑒) by summing the intensity-weighted
word-level scores, as shown in Equation 7:
𝑠 ′ (T , 𝑒) =

𝐿

3.1.4 Sentiment Score. In addition to the emotion-level features described above, we also consider the coarse-grained sentiment score
of the text. Usually, the sentiment score is a positive or negative
value, which represents the degree of the positive or negative polarity of the whole text. And it can be calculated by using sentiment
dictionaries or public toolkits. Assuming that the dimension of the
sentiment score is 𝑑𝑠 (usually, 𝑑𝑠 = 1), we can get the sentiment
score feature 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖

where 𝑒𝑚𝑜 T ∈ R𝑑 (i.e., 𝑑 = 𝑑 𝑓 + 2𝑑𝑒 + 𝑑𝑠 + 𝑑𝑎 ).

3.2

Social Emotion

We first extract Social Emotion from the comments of a news piece
and then aggregate them as the whole representation. The comments of a news piece are denoted as M = [M1, M2, . . . , M𝑖 , . . . ,
M𝐿M ], where M𝑖 is the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ comment of the news piece, and 𝐿 M is
the length of comment list. As for M𝑖 , we can calculate its emotion
vector 𝑒𝑚𝑜 M𝑖 by Equation 9, where 𝑒𝑚𝑜 M𝑖 ∈ R𝑑 . Then we stack
the transposed emotion vector (row vector) of every comment to
obtain the whole emotion vector of comments 𝑒𝑚𝑜

After getting 𝑒𝑚𝑜

the Social Emotion of the whole comment list: 1) Mean pooling for
representing the average emotional signals (Equation 11); and 2)

Emotion Gap

To model the resonances and dissonances of dual emotion, we
propose Emotion Gap (denoted as 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑔𝑎𝑝 ). It is designed as the subtraction between Publisher Emotion and Social Emotion. As shown
in Equation 14, 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑔𝑎𝑝 is concatenated by the difference of 𝑒𝑚𝑜 T
and 𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛
and the difference of 𝑒𝑚𝑜 T and 𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑥
:
M
M

𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑔𝑎𝑝 = (𝑒𝑚𝑜 T − 𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛
M ) ⊕ (𝑒𝑚𝑜 T − 𝑒𝑚𝑜 M )

(14)

where 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑔𝑎𝑝 ∈ R2𝑑 . By this means, it can measure the differences (i.e., dissonances) between the dual emotion. For emotions
resonances, the values in the Emotion Gap vector are tiny (nearly
zero).

3.4

Dual Emotion Features

Finally, Dual Emotion Features are concatenated by the Publisher
Emotion, the Social Emotion and the Emotion Gap. In Equation 15
we obtain the Dual Emotion Features, where 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ∈ R5𝑑 .
𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 = 𝑒𝑚𝑜 T ⊕ 𝑒𝑚𝑜 M ⊕ 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑔𝑎𝑝

(15)

After getting Dual Emotion Features, we can concatenate it with
representations that extracted by the fake news detectors, which
is exemplified by Figure 2. Assuming that the fake news detector
is BiGRU and the output feature vector is denoted as 𝐵𝑖𝐺𝑅𝑈 T , the
concatenated vector [𝐵𝑖𝐺𝑅𝑈 T , 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ] is fed into a multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) layer and a softmax layer for the final prediction
^ as shown in Equation 16:

𝑦^ = Softmax MLP([𝐵𝑖𝐺𝑅𝑈 T , 𝑒𝑚𝑜 𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ])

EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION

In this section, we conduct experiments to compare our proposed
Dual Emotion Features and other baseline features and explore
their roles in improving the performance of fake news detection.
Specifically, we mainly answer the following evaluation questions:
• EQ1: Are Dual Emotion Features more effective than baseline
features when used alone for fake news detection? How
effective are the different types of features in Dual Emotion
Features?
• EQ2: Can Dual Emotion Features help improve the performance of text-based fake news detectors?

• EQ3: How robust do the fake news detection models with
Dual Emotion Features in real-world scenarios?
• EQ4: How effective are the components of Dual Emotion
Features, including the publisher emotion, social emotion,
and emotion gap?

4.1

Dataset

Although the emotions are believed universal, albeit affected by culture [11], how emotions are expressed and perceived varies across
different socio-cultural backgrounds [36]. Thus, we conduct experiments on three real-world datasets in two languages (meanwhile,
two countries with different cultures), one in English (RumourEval19) and two in Chinese (Weibo-16 and Weibo-20). The statistics of
these datasets are shown in Table 2.
4.1.1 RumourEval-19. The dataset RumourEval-19 is constructed
for determining the veracity of the rumors on Twitter and Reddit.
It is released in an academic evaluation5 [16]. Each news piece is
labeled as fake, real, or unverified. We keep the same dataset splits
and evaluation criteria as what the organizers provide.
4.1.2 Weibo-16. The dataset Weibo-16 is firstly proposed in [26]
and has been a benchmark dataset of fake news detection in Chinese
[17, 38, 47]. Each news piece is labeled as fake or real. It needs to
be clarified that in the original dataset, the subset of fake news
has many duplications. Concerned about the influence to learning
and evaluation by duplications, we perform deduplication on the
subset of fake news based on a clustering algorithm based on text
similarity. As a result, the amount of clusters is only 59% of the
original amount of fake pieces. We suppose that the duplication
may increase the risk of data leakage when splitting training and
testing sets and make models tend to learn some event-specific
features[42] (as they may repeat multiple times in the training
process), which limits the generalizability of models. Therefore,
we filtered out the highly similar fake news pieces and produce a
deduplication version of Weibo-16 (Table 2). We also clustered real
news pieces but found no duplications in Weibo-16. As an empirical
supplement of our analysis, we conduct comparison experiments
between the original and the deduplication version of Weibo-16,
and verified the necessity of deduplication (see details in Appendix
A). In our experiments in the main text, the deduplicated Weibo-16
is divided into train / val. / test sets in the ratio of 3:1:1.
4.1.3 Weibo-20. As a benchmark Chinese dataset for fake news
detection, Weibo-16 contains fake news pieces ranging from Dec
2010 to April 2014, and is not extended until now. Besides, the scale
of Weibo-16 is smaller after deduplication (Section 4.1.2). Therefore,
we constructed the dataset Weibo-20 on the basis of Weibo-16.
We keep the two-class setting (i.e., fake or real for each news
pieces). For fake news, we retain the 1,355 fake news pieces of
Weibo-16 and further collect news pieces judged as misinformation
officially by Weibo Community Management Center6 (the same
source of fake news of Weibo-16 [26]) ranging from April 2014 to
Nov 2018. And we filter out the highly similar fake news pieces and
guarantee there are no duplications. For real news, we retain the
2,351 real news pieces of Weibo-16 and gather 850 unique real news

pieces in the same period as the fake news. The newly-collected real
news pieces are real news verified by NewsVerify7 which focuses
on discovering and verifying suspicious news pieces on Weibo.
Totally, Weibo-20 contains 3,161 fake news pieces and 3,201 real
news pieces. As for dataset splits, we split train / val. / test sets in
the ratio of 3:1:1.

4.2

Preliminary Analysis of Dual Emotion
Signals

To check whether it is statistically dependent or not between dual
emotion signals and the veracity of news pieces, we construct two
categorical variables to do a chi-squared statistical significance test.
The one is News Veracity, whose value is Fake or Real. The other is
Dual Emotion Category, whose value is combined publisher emotion
category and social emotion category, such as publisher emotion
is none and social emotion is angry. To calculate the value of Dual
Emotion Category, we use the open-source emotion classification
model released by NVIDIA8 [21] for RumourEval-19, and use Emotion Detection Service on Baidu AI platform9 for the two Chinese
datasets. In the chi-squared statistical significance test, we firstly assume that the dual emotion signals are independent of the veracity
of news pieces (i.e., the null hypothesis). Then we check whether
the chi-squared statistic is over the critical value or not. Specifically,
on the dataset RumourEval-19, the chi-squared statistic is 50.570,
over the critical value of 48.602 for the probability of 95%, which
means we can reject the null hypothesis. Similarly, on the dataset
Weibo-16, the chi-squared statistic is 209.14, which is much more
than the critical value of 50.892 for the probability of 99%. And on
the dataset Weibo 20, the chi-squared statistic is 239.963, which is
much more than the critical value of 46.963 for the probability of
99%. In conclusion, we can reject the null hypothesis on all three
datasets, which indicates that dual emotion signals are statistically
dependent on news veracity.

8 https://github.com/NVIDIA/sentiment-discovery
9 https://ai.baidu.com/tech/nlp/emotion_detection

We visualize the variable Dual Emotion Category further. On RumourEval 19, we select three emotion categories to visualize, joyful,
sad and none (over 98% of news pieces covered). And on Chinese
datasets, we select four emotion categories, angry, disgusting, happy
and none (over 97% of news pieces covered). We utilize the heatmap
to exhibit the distribution of Dual Emotion Category in Figure 3. In
the heatmap, each cell represents the percentage of news pieces
whose Dual Emotion Category is the specific value. And we normalize the percentages for each row (i.e., each publisher emotion).
For example, in the top sub-figure of Figure 3a, the upper-left cell
indicates that among fake news pieces whose publisher emotion is
joyful, the percentage of pieces whose social emotion is also joyful
is 85.5%.
In Figure 3, we can see there are distinct emotion resonances and
emotion dissonances in fake news from real news. For example, in
Figure 3a, the percentage of dual emotion categories that are both
joyful in fake news is 8.2% higher than that of real news. And the
percentage of emotion dissonance with sad publisher emotion and
joyful social emotion in fake news is 1.9% higher than real news.
Evidence is stronger on the two Chinese datasets. Specifically, as
for emotion resonances, there are more news pieces whose dual
emotion categories are both angry and are both disgusting in fake
news than real news. As for emotion dissonances, there are more
news pieces emotion dissonances with are happy/none publisher
emotion but angry/disgusting social emotion in fake news.
It needs to be recognized that the specific emotion resonances
or dissonances may vary from English to Chinese datasets, since
the expression styles of people using different languages may be
also different. However, our analysis shows that on each dataset
itself, no matter what its dominant language is, the fake news owns
distinct emotion resonances and dissonances from real news, which
can be helpful for distinguishing the fake and real news.

Experimental Setup

4.3.1 Emotion Resources. For emotion classifiers, as described in
Section 4.2, we adopt the pretrained models of NVIDIA for English

and Baidu AI for Chinese. To ensure the robustness of the two models, per language we randomly sampled 100 instances and had their
emotion categories manually and independently labeled by three
annotators, resulting the accuracy of 87% for NVIDIA model and
83% for Baidu model. Therefore, the two classifiers are considered
reliable for extracting emotions for fake news detection. As for
other emotion resources, for English corpus, we adopt NRC Emotion lexicon[30] and NRC Emotion Intensity lexicon[29] to extract
emotion lexicon and emotion intensity features, respectively. And
we use the Vader package of NLTK[3] to calculate sentiment scores.
For Chinese corpus, we adopt the Affective Lexicon Ontology[46]
to extract emotion lexicon and emotion intensity features. And we
utilize the dictionary HowNet[10] to calculate sentiment scores.
As for auxiliary features in Table 1, for emoticons, we utilize the
List of emoticons of Wikipedia[43] and divide emoticons into five
emotions: happy, angry, surprised, sad and neutral. For sentimental
words and degree words, we use the bilingual sentiment dictionary
in HowNet[10]. For negation words, we compile the words list from
Wikipedia, Oxford Dictionary, and Cambridge Dictionary.10
4.3.2 Fake News Detectors and Baselines. In the experiments, we
select two baseline emotion features to evaluate the effectiveness
of our Dual Emotion Features. These features are implemented with
the same emotion dictionaries as Dual Emotion Features:
• Emoratio: Ajao et al. [1] propose an emotion feature that
can be extracted from the content text of news pieces, named
10 The

negation word lists are released together with our code and datasets.

emoratio. It is calculated by the ratio of count of negative
emotional words and count of positive emotional words.
• EmoCred: Giachanou et al. [15] utilize the emotional lexicon and intensity features of the content texts. These features
are calculated based on the lexicons’ occurrence frequency.
For testing the ability of the emotional features to help the textbased fake news detectors (especially those that do not explicitly
model the emotional signals), we select BiGRU (as Figure 2 shows),
BERT, and other state-of-the-art fake news detectors as follows:
• BiGRU: Text-based models like GRU[8] and LSTM[18] are
proven effective for fake news detection in [7, 26]. Here we
use BiGRU to examine whether Dual Emotion Features can
improve it or not. In practice, as for word embeddings, we
use GloVe [31] for English and Chinese Word Vectors for
Chinese [25]. The max sequence length of 𝐵𝑖𝐺𝑅𝑈 T is 100,
and the dimensionality of hidden state of 𝐵𝑖𝐺𝑅𝑈 T is 32.
• BERT [9]: As a strong text classification model, BERT has
been adopted to represent semantic signals when detecting
fake news in [45]. In the experiments, we truncate the sequences to the maximum length of 512, and finetune the
pretrained models11 for our task.
• NileTMRG [13]: For RumourEval-19 dataset, we use the
model implemented by the competition organizers12 [16],
NileTMRG. The model is effective and outperforms other
11 The

pretrained models are downloaded from https://huggingface.co/models. We use
bert-base-uncased for English and bert-base-chinese for Chinese.

WWW ’21, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia

contestants’ models of the leaderboard except for the champion. The model is a linear SVM and uses text features, social
features, and use comment stance features. In practice, we
keep all the hyperparameters of the original model.
• HSA-BLSTM [17]: For the two Chinese datasets, we implement the HSA-BLSTM, which is widely used as a baseline
on Weibo-16 dataset. The authors propose a hierarchical attention neural network and utilize not only the contents of
news pieces but also the comments. In experiments, we keep
all the hyperparameters as those in the original model.
4.3.3 Model Parameters. The dimensionalities of sub features in
Dual Emotion Features, i.e., 𝑑 𝑓 , 𝑑𝑒 , 𝑑𝑠 and 𝑑𝑎 , are determined by
the language-specific emotion resources. The value of 𝑑 𝑓 , as the
output of pretrained emotion classifiers, is 16 for English and 8 for
Chinese. The value of 𝑑𝑒 is the size of emotion kinds of the English
or Chinese emotion dictionaries, which is 8 or 21, respectively.
For 𝑑𝑠 , sentiment scores of English texts, produced by the Vader
package of NLTK, correspond to four dimensions (positive, negative,
neutral and compound), while sentiment scores of Chinese texts are
calculated by HowNet, which have one dimension only. The value
of 𝑑𝑎 is the number of the heuristic features in Table 1, which is 16
for English and 15 for Chinese. The full dimension 𝑑 is computed as
Equation 9, which is 52 for English and 66 for Chinese. The window
size is 2, which was determined by grid search that maximizes the
performance on the validation set. As for the amount of comments,
we set 𝐿 M = 100, which means that only the earliest 100 comments
(or less) of every news piece are considered. In Equation 16, the
output dimensionality of MLP is 32.
4.3.4 Evaluation Metrics. On RumourEval-19, we adopt the official
evaluation metrics, macro F1 score and RMSE (root mean squared
error) [16]. Considering the imbalance of the dataset, we also consider the F1 scores of fake, real, and unverified news. On the two
Weibo datasets, we use accuracy and macro F1 score as the evaluation metrics, the same as [17]. We also the F1 scores of fake and
real news. The other experiments use the macro F1 score.

Results

4.4.1 Effectiveness of Dual Emotion Features. To answer EQ1 under
the circumstance that the confounding factor of fake news detectors
is excluded, we utilize emotion features alone to detect fake news.
We adopt a simple five-layer MLP and feed only emotion features
into it. Table 3 displays the results on the three datasets.

In Table 3, among the three emotion features that source from
Content, Publisher Emotion is more effective than EmoCred and
Emoratio, especially on RumourEval. It reveals the effectiveness
of Dual Emotion Features in modeling emotional signals. What’s
more, we can see the more improvements of Social Emotion and
Emotion Gap, which are first proposed to help detect fake news
in this paper. Specifically, on RumourEval-19, using Emotion Gap
owns 4.2% increase than Publisher Emotion. And on the two Chinese
datasets, using Social Emotion or Emotion Gap can both improve the
macro F1 score of more than 10%. Moreover, using Dual Emotion
Features can further obtain enhancements on the three datasets.
Especially on RumourEval-19, only using Dual Emotion Features for
fake news detection owns a high macro F1 score of 0.337. And only
using Emotion Gap is also effective, which is 0.332 for the macro F1
score. It is worth mentioning that such two emotion features even
outperform the state-of-the-art model NileTMRG (0.309 for macro
F1 score, shown in Table 5). That indicates the necessity of dual
emotion signals and the importance of mining dual emotion and the
relationship between them for fake news detection. Additionally,
it needs to be clarified that comparing the three datasets to each
other, the performances in RumourEval-19 are rather worse than
the two Chinese datasets. The reasons are discussed in [16, 23], that
the amount of news pieces is small and there is a relatively low
inter-annotator agreement for the dataset.
In Section 3.1, we adopt five types of emotion features when
modeling emotional signals (Emotion Category, Emotion Lexicon,
Emotional Intensity, Sentiment Score, and Other Auxiliary Features).
To verify the effect of every type of emotion features, we remove
one specific type of features from Dual Emotion Features every time,
to observe the performance changes. As Table 4 shows, the macro
F1 scores of Dual Emotion Features all decrease regardless of the
removed type of emotion features. Thus, it reveals the necessity of
using five types of emotion features jointly.
4.4.2 Performance Evaluation within Fake News Detectors. To answer EQ2, we exhibit the results of adding Dual Emotion Features into the existing fake news detectors on the three datasets.
Table 5 exhibits the results on RumourEval-19 dataset. Overall, after using Dual Emotion Features, the three fake news detectors are both improved a lot. Specifically, on the text-based detectors, BiGRU and BERT, the use of Dual Emotion Features both
improves the performance more than EmoCred and Emoratio. Especially, putting Dual Emotion Features into BERT owns 0.346 for
macro F1 score, far more than the other two emotion features. On

the state-of-the-art model NileTMRG, using Emoratio and Dual
Emotion Features both improves the macro F1 score further. And
the improvement of Dual Emotion Features is 3.3%, which is 1.1%
higher than Emoratio.
The experimental results on the two Weibo datasets are displayed
in Table 6. Overall, we can see that our proposed Dual Emotion Features outperforms Emoratio and EmoCred on any models in both
datasets. Specifically, on BiGRU and BERT, the improvements in
macro F1 score of Dual Emotion Features are at least 1.5% higher
on the two datasets. However, when using Emoratio or EmoCred
on BiGRU, sometimes the metrics even decrease. It reveals that
Emoratio and EmoCred are more likely to be overfitted, since both
of them focus on the contents alone but ignore the comments. And
learning dual emotion jointly can avoid this situation to some extent. On the state-of-the-art model HSA-BLSTM, after using Dual
Emotion Features as an enhancement, all the metrics are improved
further in both datasets. Especially in Weibo-16, the accuracy and
macro F1 score both own about 6% improvement, far more than
Emoratio and EmoCred.

4.4.3 Evaluation Under Real-World Scenario Simulation. In the
fields of fake news detection, when splitting datasets, most works
just shuffle the datasets and split them into train / val. / test sets
[17, 26, 38, 47], including the datasets splits in Table 2. The kind
of data split can somehow prove the effectiveness of proposed
methods, but also has a shortcoming: In the real-world scenarios,
when a check-worthy news piece emerges, we only own the data
previously-emerging to train the detector, which cannot be guaranteed when adopting the above data split. To answer EQ3, we
simulate a real-world scenario by additionally performing a temporal data split, which means that instances in the train / val. / test
sets are arranged in chronological order, to evaluate the ability of
models to detect future news pieces.
In this section, we adopt the dataset Weibo-20 and select the
most recent 20% news pieces of them as the testing set. Among the
remaining 80% news pieces, we next select the most recent 25% of
them for validation and let the others be the training set. The results
on temporally split Weibo-20 are displayed in Table 7. Compared
with Table 2, we can see that in Table 7 all the performances decrease
a lot. It indicates that the temporal data-split strategy creates a more

challenging scenario, because the topics and writing styles of newly
arrived instances are likely to change over time. Such a scenario
can somehow expose the drawback of existing techniques and
it requires a model of higher generalizability to cope with novel
instances.
Under this hard setting, the models with our proposed Dual
Emotion Features still outperform those with Emoratio and EmoCred. Sometimes the introduction of Emoratio or EmoCred even
leads to a performance decrease. In contrast, using Dual Emotion
Features still enhances both models and increases all the metrics,
which reveals the effectiveness and generalization ability of Dual
Emotion Features to some extent.
4.4.4 Ablation Study. To answer EQ4, we further conduct ablation
experiments on RumourEval-19, Weibo-16, Weibo-20 and Weibo20 (temporally) (splitting datasets temporally, described in Section 4.4.3). The results are displayed in Table 8.
In Table 8, we can see that among the four datasets, adding
Dual Emotion Features into the fake news detectors all obtain the
highest macro F1 scores. Besides, compared with the original fake
news detectors (Table 5 and Table 6), using any component of Dual
Emotion Features all enhances the performances of them. During the
three components of Dual Emotion Features, it exhibits that adopting
Social Emotion or Emotion Gap improves the macro F1 scores more
than Publisher Emotion on any models on all the datasets. So it
concludes that Social Emotion and Emotion Gap matter more when
detecting fake news.

Case Study

We provide a qualitative analysis of Dual Emotion Features in some
cases. Take the detector BiGRU on RumourEval-19 as an example,
we select three fake news pieces that missed by the original BiGRU
but detected after using Dual Emotion Features as an enhancement
(Figure 4). In the figure, there are rich dual emotion signals in
every case, such as emotion resonances of angry in the left case,
of joyful in the middle case, and emotion dissonances with none
publisher emotion and sad social emotion in the right case. However,
it exhibits using Emoratio or EmoCred do not help BiGRU detect

rightly for the three cases. It reveals that mining dual emotion
additionally sometimes is a remedy for the incompetence of only
using semantics for detecting fake news.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we bring a new concept of dual emotion, i.e., the
publisher emotion and social emotion, into fake news research. We
uncover the relationship between dual emotion signals (especially,
the emotion gap) and the news veracity. Based on the data observation and analysis, we further propose a feature set, Dual Emotion
Features, to expose the distinctive emotional signals for detecting
fake news. Further, we exhibit that our proposed features can be
easily plugged into existing fake news detectors as an enhancement.
The extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets
(including a newly-constructed Chinese dataset) have demonstrated
that our proposed feature set outperforms the existing emotional
features in fake news detection and essentially improves the performance of existing text-based methods. In future work, we plan to
leverage multi-modal information (e.g., emotion in visual contents)
to capture the emotions more precisely and use more sophisticated
models for dual emotion representation.

APPENDIX A. THE REASONS WHY THE
DATASET WEIBO-16 NEEDS TO BE
DEDUPLICATED
In Section 4.1.2, we mention that the original version of Weibo-16
contains many duplications of fake news pieces. Table 9 shows
the data statistics. Comparing to Table 2, the number of fake news
pieces decrease from 2,312 to 1,355 after deduplication. And there
are no duplications in real news pieces.

To further research the impact of duplications data on the ability
of models, we conduct comparison experiments on the original and
deduplicated versions of Weibo-16 respectively. And the results are
exhibited in Table 10. Here we choose BiGRU and HSA-BLSTM
as fake news detectors. Considering the class imbalance of the

deduplicated version of the dataset, we train the models based on
class weights on the deduplicated training set.

Models

In Table 10, we can see that if we train and validate the detectors
on the deduplicated version of the dataset, the performances of
the two detectors will increase on the original testing set (shown
in bold in the table). Therefore, it verifies that training on the
deduplicated datasets will enhance the generalization ability of
the models to some extent. Moreover, if we fix the training and
validation set deduplicated and just change the testing set from the
original version to the deduplicated version, on BiGRU the macro
F1 score and accuracy increase, while on HSA-BLSTM the metrics
both decrease. We suppose the reasons are that on the original
testing set, the detectors will predict the duplicated news pieces
as highly similar results. So some clusters of duplicated pieces
may be all predicted correctly, while others may be all predicted
mistakenly, resulting in the unstable performance of the detectors.
In a conclusion, deduplicating the dataset can help mitigate this
issue.

APPENDIX B. THE METHOD TO CALCULATE
THE DUAL EMOTION CATEGORY
It is mentioned in Section 4.2 that we use the pretrained emotion
classifiers to calculate the value of Dual Emotion Category. The
method to calculate the Dual Emotion Category are as follows:
For publisher emotion, we feed the text of the news content into
the emotion classifier and take the emotion with the maximum
probability as the publisher emotion category. For social emotion,
we feed the news comments once a time. After getting the output
vector of each comment, each dimension of which represents the
probability of the given comment having a certain kind of emotion,
we average the probability vector of all the comments in each dimension. Finally, we take the emotion with the maximum probability
as the social emotion category (i.e., soft voting).
For example, assume that the the output of an emotion classifier
is a probability vector on angry, disgusting, happy and none and the
given news piece has two comments. The content probabilities are
[0.3, 0.1, 0, 0.6]. So we can use the corresponding emotion of 0.6,
none, as the publisher emotion category. The probability vector is
[0.8, 0.1, 0, 0.1] for the first comment, and [0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0] for the
second comment. So we firstly average all the comment probability
values and get [0.7, 0.2, 0.05, 0.05]. Then we use the corresponding
emotion of 0.7, angry, as the news social emotion category. Thus,
the categorical variable Dual Emotion Category is none for publisher
emotion and angry for social emotion.
