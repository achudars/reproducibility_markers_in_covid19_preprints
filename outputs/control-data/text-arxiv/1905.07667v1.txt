The Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, is the world’s largest bolometric experiment. The detector consists of
an array of 988 TeO2 crystals, for a total mass of 742 kg. CUORE is presently in data taking,
searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay of 130Te. CUORE is operational since the
spring of 2017. The initial science run already allowed to provide the most stringent limit on
the neutrinoless double beta decay half-life of 130Te, and to perform the most precise measurement of the two-neutrino double beta decay half-life. Up to date, we have more than doubled
the collected exposure. In this talk, we presenteded the most recent results and discuss the
present status of the CUORE experiment.

Introduction

Neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ, 1 ) is a rare nuclear process not predicted by the Standard
Model in which a pair of neutrons inside a nucleus transforms into a pair of protons, with
the emission of two electrons: (A, Z) → (A, Z + 2) + 2e− . This transition clearly violates the
conservation of the number of leptons. The observation of 0νββ would thus demonstrate that
the lepton number is not a symmetry of nature. At the same time, 0νββ provides a key tool to
study neutrinos by probing whether their nature is that of Majorana particles and providing us
with important information on the neutrino absolute mass scale and ordering 2 .
The huge impact on Particle Physics has motivated and continues to motivate a strong
experimental effort to search for 0νββ. Among the experiments searching for 0νββ, CUORE 3 ,
acronym for Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events, is looking for the transition:
130
Te → 130Xe + 2 e – .
CUORE is located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy (∼ 3600 m w. e.) and
is presently in data-taking. The experiment is expected to collect data for a total of five years
of live-time.

CUORE detector

The CUORE detector comprises an array of 988 5 × 5 × 5 cm3 natTeO2 crystals arranged into
19 towers of 13 4-crystal floors 4 . Each crystal has a mass of 750 g, giving a total detector mass
of 742 kg, i. e. 206 kg of 130Te. The crystals are operated as cryogenic bolometers.
Bolometers are calorimeters in which the energy released inside an absorber by an interacting
particle is converted into phonons and measured via temperature variation. These detectors can

only be operated at cryogenic temperatures in order to minimize the heat capacity, since the
intrinsic response of a calorimeter is proportional to this parameter. In the case of CUORE, the
working temperature is about 10 mK, where the heat capacity of the TeO2 crystals is ∼ 100 µK
per MeV. To detect any slight variation in temperature, each CUORE crystal is instrumented
with a neutron transmutation doped (NTD) Ge thermistor. Furthermore, all the crystals are
also instrumented with a Si heater, to stabilize the detector response by cyclically delivering a
fixed (and extremely precise) amount of energy to the bolometers.
The detector assembly took almost two years, from September 2012 to July 2014. Thanks to
specifically designed procedures 5 , the CUORE crystals were never exposed to air (thus avoiding
the risk of contamination by Rn) from the moment of the polishing after growth until the
installation of the detector. This latter operation was performed in summer 2016, after the
completion of the commissioning of the cryogenic system. In the meanwhile, for about two
years, the towers were stored inside the CUORE clean room into sealed containers constantly
flushed with clean N2 .

CUORE cryostat

Given the huge size and mass, the CUORE detector could not be housed in any standard
cryostat. In order to operate the detector, a custom cryogenic system had thus to be designed
and constructed, satisfying very stringent experimental requirements in terms of high cooling
power, low noise environment and low radioactivity content (Fig. 1, 6 ).
The CUORE cryostat is a large custom cryogen-free cryostat cooled by 5 Pulse Tube Refrigerators and by a high-power 3He/ 4He Dilution Unit with 3 µW at 10 mK. The cryostat comprises
six nested high-purity-copper vessels, the innermost of which encloses an experimental volume
of about 1 m3 . The various stages thermalize to different temperatures, from room temperature
to ∼ 10 mK, and are identified by their approximate temperatures: 300 K, 40 K, 4 K, 800 mK or
Still, 50 mK or Heat EXchanger (HEX), and 10 mK or Mixing Chamber (MC). At the center, the
Tower Support Plate (TSP) holding the detector is attached to a dedicated suspension system in
order to reduce the amount of vibrations. The 300 K and the 4 K vessels are vacuum-tight and

define two vacuum volumes called the Outer Vacuum Chamber (OVC) and the Inner Vacuum
Chamber (IVC). The detector is shielded from the external radioactivity by two lead shields
placed inside the IVC. The Inner Lead Shield (ILS) stands between the 4 K and the Still stages
and provides side shielding and shielding from below. This shield is made of ancient Roman
lead, with extremely low concentration of 210Pb (< 4 mBq kg− 1 7 ). The Top Lead is positioned
below the MC plate and provides shielding from above. The whole cryostat is protected from the
environmental radioactivity by the external shield made of 70 t of lead and borated polyethylene.
To cooldown the detector to its working temperature, almost one month is required in order
to extract more than 7 · 108 J of enthalpy from the system. The initial phase of the cooldown
process is driven by a dedicated Fast Cooling System, that circulates He gas through an external
cooling circuit and injects it directly into the IVC. Then, the Pulse Tubes bring the inner cryostat
stages down to about 4 K and the Dilution Unit completes the cooldown of the Still, HEX and
MC stages (including the detector).
The cooldown of CUORE took place between December 2016 and January 2017. Indeed,
after the cryostat construction, a period of about four years was required for the commissioning
of the cryogenic system, before the installation of the CUORE detector. The commissioning
was long and complex. It involved several test and cooldowns to integrate the numerous custom
components and to check the system performance. Nonetheless, at the end of this process, the
success of the CUORE cryostat marked a major milestone in the history of low-temperature
detector techniques and opened the way for large bolometric arrays (tonne-scale) for rare event
physics.

Initial results from CUORE

The initial few months of operation of CUORE were devoted to the detector characterization and
optimization, i. e. to the tuning of all the detector parameters and to set of the environmental
conditions on which we could act. The experiment sensitivity depends on factors such as the
energy resolution and the live time. Therefore, we wanted to identify stable working conditions
and, at the same time, to improve the energy resolution by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio.
We performed temperature scans around the cryostat base temperature to select the one that
optimized the signal and could give the designed NTD working resistance (a few hundreds MΩ).
A preliminary optimization phase occurred before the first dataset, while a second “refined”
one was performed in between the first and the second dataset. In CUORE, each dataset includes
one-day-long runs for a total of about one month of Physics data, and is started and ended with
a calibration. In both datasets, the number of active channels was 984. However, during the
analysis a fraction of these had to be removed for different reasons (e. g. too much noise, failure
during one or more analysis steps, insufficient statistics collected during calibration, . . . ). In the
end, the analysis was performed on 876 channels and 935 channels, respectively. The average
energy resolution at Qββ , mediated over all the active channels, was (7.7 ± 0.5) keV, with an
observed improvement during the data collection thanks to the optimization campaign. The first
results released by the CUORE collaboration include these two datasets, and cover the interval
between May and September 2017, for a total TeO2 exposure of 86.3 kg yr 3 .
We performed a blind search for 0νββ. Before unblinding the actual data, we fixed the model
and fitting strategy. We estimated the line shape parameters for each bolometer-dataset with
a simultaneous, unbinned extended maximum likelihood (UEML) fit performed on each tower
in the energy range (2530 − 2720) keV. In particular, all individual detectors were constrained
to have the same decay rate, which we allowed to vary freely in the fit. The results is shown in
Fig. 2, where the 155 candidate events in the Region of Interest (ROI) that passed all selection
are shown, together with the UEML fit.
We found no evidence for 0νββ of 130Te. Including the systematic uncertainties, we could
place a lower limit on the decay half-life of 1.3 · 1025 yr at 90% C. L. . Combining this result with

those of two earlier experiments, Cuoricino 8 and CUORE-0 9 , we obtained the most stringent
limit to date on this decay, i. e. 1.5·1025 yr at 90% C. L. . We converted the combined half-life limit
as a limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass, mββ , in the framework of models that assume
0νββ to mediated by light Majorana neutrino exchange. We found mββ < (110 − 520) meV,
where the range reflects the uncertainties coming from the nuclear physics.

CUORE background and 2νββ

In order to systematically study the CUORE radioactive contamination, we developed a background model able to describe the observed spectrum in terms of contributions from contamination from the materials directly facing the detector, the whole cryogenic setup, and the
environmental radioactivity. This detailed Monte Carlo was used over the years to guide the construction strategies of the experiment and, later, to project a background model for CUORE 10 .
By analyzing the data from CUORE, we could ultimately test our model.
We measured a background generally in line with or expectations: we observed an average
of (0.014 ± 0.002) counts keV−1 kg−1 yr−1 inside the ROI. The contribution from γ radiation was
significantly reduced with respect to CUORE-0, and most of the α-induced background was
compatible. We observed an excess in the counts from 210Po. Most likely, this is coming from
shallow contamination in copper around the detectors, but we are still investigating it. Anyway,
its related contribution to the ROI is estimated at level of 10−4 counts keV−1 kg−1 yr−1 .
Thanks to our background model, we successfully reconstructed the background contribution
that could be ascribed to the two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ) of 130Te. Therefore, we
were able to measure its half-life and we obtained (7.9 ± 0.1 (stat.) ± 0.2 (syst.)) · 1020 yr. This is
the world’s most precise measurement on this decay.
At the same time, by comparing the contribution of the 2νββ to the total background
of CUORE with that CUORE-0 (Fig. 3), we could see that, while in the earlier experiment
the 2νββ spectrum accounted for ∼ 20% of counts in the (1 − 2) MeV region, in CUORE the
2νββ spectrum dominates for nearly all events in the same energy range 11 .

Outlook

CUORE will collect data for a total of five years of live-time. The predicted final sensitivity is
9.0 · 1025 yr at 90% C. L. 12 .

Figure 3 – CUORE-0 (Left) and CUORE first data release (Right) spectra compared to the 2νββ contribution
predicted by the reference fits. The 40K peak from the crystal contamination (the radioactive source that has the
strongest correlation with the 2νββ) is also reported.

CUORE itself represents a fundamental step toward the next generation of detectors. Starting from the experience, the expertise, and the lessons learned while running CUORE, the
CUPID project (CUORE Upgrade with Particle IDentification 13 ) aims at developing a future
bolometric 0νββ experiment with sensitivity on the half-life of the order of (1027 − 1028 ) yr.
Thermal detectors are expected to play a central role in the forthcoming future of the search for
0νββ.
