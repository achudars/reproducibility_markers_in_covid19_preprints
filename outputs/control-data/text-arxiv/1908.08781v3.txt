ABSTRACT
We examine the effect of uniform ambient magnetic fields on the evolution of supernova-driven
blast waves into a homogeneous ambient ISM in thermal equilibrium. Using the Pencil Code we
simulate high resolution nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations in 3D. We find that supernova
blast waves are sensitive to plane-parallel magnetic fields of strength in excess of 1 µG for ambient
gas number density 1 cm−3 . Perpendicular to the field, the inward magnetic pressure gradient induces
retrograde mass accretion in the wake of the primary shock front. Subsequently, we find that the
primary shockwave expands faster perpendicular to the field, but with reduced momentum, while the
remnant core is subject to magnetic confinement. This leads to a decrease in fractional volume of hot
gas but also an increase in the density and temperature of hot gas in the magnetically confined remnant.
The magnetic pressure gradient behind the shock front generates enhanced regions favourable to UVheating and thus reduces net radiative losses. Although the presence of a strong uniform magnetic
field can reduce momentum early on, and hence residual kinetic energy, it increases the efficiency of
residual total energy injection by the SN into the ISM by up to 40% within 1 Myr.

1. INTRODUCTION

Supernova explosions (SNe) play a significant role in
galactic dynamics. They provide pressure support and
inject energy, driving turbulence and large-scale outflows (McKee & Ostriker 1977; Chevalier & Clegg 1985;
Mac Low & Klessen 2004; Murray et al. 2005; Girichidis
et al. 2016). Isolated SNe can significantly impact their
local ambient environment, whether evacuating or fragmenting a dense molecular cloud from within, or expansion into, and advection through, less dense hot gas
regions. Clusters of SN can form larger hot gas structures (superbubbles or chimneys), spanning typically
hundreds of parsec, and feeding the galactic fountain.
Both individual SNe and SNe clusters, such as superbubbles arising from OB associations, have been studied
analytically (Taylor 1950; Sedov 1959; Tomisaka et al.
1981; Cioffi et al. 1988) and numerically (Chevalier 1974;
Ferriere et al. 1991; Slavin & Cox 1992; Jun & Norman
1996; Tomisaka 1998; Caunt & Korpi 2001; Hanayama &

Tomisaka 2006; Zirakashvili & Ptuskin 2008; Kim & Ostriker 2015; Yadav et al. 2017). SNe evolution is spherically symmetric in a non-magnetized uniform ambient
ISM (Spitzer 1978; Cioffi et al. 1988). From a 1D model
Chevalier (1974) concluded that if the postshock magnetic pressure does not exceed the ram pressure, then
the magnetic field does not affect the SN remnant dynamics, other than the thickness of its shell. Further,
from 3D ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations Kim & Ostriker (2015) conclude that the final momentum injected by an SNe is insensitve to the the magnetic field, although if the ambient plasma-β is greater
than 1 the late stage remnant temperature is affected.
Hanayama & Tomisaka (2006) show that strong planeparallel magnetic fields can inhibit the expansion of individual SN remnants perpendicular to the magnetic field,
thus altering the aspect ratio of the remnant and leading to a deviation from the spherical expansion typical of
hydrodynamic (HD) remnants. Caunt & Korpi (2001)
show the expansion profile for an individual SN remnant
in a magnetized medium, with the blast wave expanding
faster perpendicular to a uniform, plane-parallel magnetic field. While the results of Hanayama & Tomisaka
(2006) and Caunt & Korpi (2001) seem to disagree, we

aim to show that they instead describe complimentary
aspects of MHD remnant expansion.
In this Paper, we focus on understanding the role of
a large-scale magnetic field in simulations of SN remnants in an idealised physical setup. Our initial aim is
twofold: to examine the effects of large-scale magnetic
fields in isolation, and to assess the claim that largescale magnetic fields do not affect momentum injection
in SN remnants. In order to make direct comparison, we
use similar parameters to numerical models from earlier
studies.
SN explosions are a major component of larger-scale
numerical models of galaxies, evolving turbulence in
which SN remnants are more realistically embedded.
However, these models are typically too coarse to resolve
SN remnants self-consistently. Remnant-scale modelling
provides necessary constraints on the critical aspect of
energy injection to apply in the larger simulations. However, a less idealized model will utlimately be required
for comparison with SN remnant observations. We shall
develop such models in an incremental and cumulative
manner in subsequent studies.
In Section 2 we present details of the numerical model.
We then discuss magnetic effects on the aspect ratio of
SN remamnts in Section 3. This is followed examination
of the effect of large-scale magnetic fields on momentum
injection by SN remnants in Section 4. In Section 5 we
discuss magnetic effects on the thermodynamical properties of SN remnants. Residual energy injection by the
remnants into the ISM is measured in Section 6 and we
consider the critical magnetic field strength for MHD
effects to become important in Section 7. We present a
summary and discussion of our results in Section 8.
As a sanity check we compute some shock-tube experiments and and other related tests, which verify our
qualitative results are not sensitive to numerical recipes
or parameters. These are external to the focus of the paper so we include them in an Appendix. In Appendix A,
we discuss the effect of physical parameters on 1D HD
and MHD shocks. Appendix B provides a preliminary
set of results on the effects of large-scale magnetic fields
on 1D shocks in ambient gas densities ranging from
n = 10−2 cm−3 to n = 10−2 cm2 . Appendix C examines the effect of changing ambient gas temperature in
3D simulations of SN explosions.

The MHD equations applied include the compressible
form of the continuity equation

where ρ is the gas density and ρ̇SN is the mass of the
SN ejecta, which for the purposes of these experiments is
set to zero. An artificial shock dependant mass diffusion,
ζD , is required for numerical stability in simulations of
the SN-driven turbulent ISM. ζD ∝ fshock , where

contrast to the previous equations we do not include any

effect of suppressing magnetic field in the SN remnant
shell through excessively rapid diffusion (reconnection).

Milky Way has mean molecular weight 0.531 when assumed to be fully ionised. A comprehensive description
of the Pencil Code application to SN driven ISM turbulence is given in Gent (2012, Chapter 3), while the further enhancement of shock handling and stability methods for reproducing SN blast waves in HD are presented
in Gent et al. (2019).
Here, we consider a plane-parallel uniform magnetic
field B = (0, B0 , 0), for B0 ∈ [0, 5] µG. With a fiducial

gas number density, n0 , for the ambient ISM of 1 cm−3
and resolution 0.5 parsec along each side, we use a Cartesian grid of 5282 by 576 parallel to the field. For consistent thermal pressure in the ambient ISM throughout
the duration of the model blastwaves we set a thermal
equilibrium temperature of T ' 260 K.
The numerical model uses constant magnetic resistivity, η = 8 · 10−4 kpc km s−1 and sound speed dependent
viscosity, ν = ν0 cs , where ν0 = ∆x = 5 · 10−4 kpc is the
grid resolution, and cs is the speed of sound. A test of alternate Prandtl numbers produced qualitatively similar
solutions, and results were convergent with resolution of
0.5 pc, other than a thinner more dense remnant shell.

With a weak magnetic field B0 ≤ 0.5 µG, the evolution
of the remnant is very similar to the HD model. With
stronger B0 the remnant core is less diffuse, and the
slightly less dense remnant shell parallel to the field is
coincident with the HD model shell. However, perpen-

dicular to the field the mass profile of the remnant is
substantially altered. Mass is more confined within the
remnant, but Figure 1 also shows that the SN shockwave propagates faster perpendicular to the magnetic
field while carrying less mass at the shock front.
Figure 2(a) shows the shockwave at 2 Myr compressing magnetic field lines to form a dense magnetic collar. Magnetic field is initially evacuated from the core
of the remnant. It is evident that the MHD remnant
core geometry resembles a prolate spheroid with the polar radius parallel to the magnetic field. The ratio of
polar to equatorial radius increases with field strength.
In contrast, the remnant shock front forms the surface of
an oblate spheroid with equatorial radius perpendicular
to the magnetic field. This ratio of polar to equatorial
radius decreases with field strength.
Figure 2(b) shows the structure of flows driven by the
remnant in a strongly magnetized ambient ISM. The
shockwave drives outward flows as expected. We find
inward flows of comparable speed to the outward flows.
There are retrograde shocks towards the core in all the
models, but for the HD and weakly magnetic models
these carry negligible mass. For strong B0 the magnetic
forces drive inward gas flow from the shell, perpendicular to the magnetic field. As the flow approaches the
thermally dominated core, the outward thermal pressure gradient channels the flows parallel to the magnetic
field, creating a quadrupolar velocity field between the
shockwave and core. In the HD and weakly magnetized
remnants, the internal gas flows of the remnant remain
radially outward.

By 2 Myr the magnetic field along with some of the
gas, has filled almost half the remnant void behind the
shock front. This forms an inter-shock region between
the core of the remnant and its shell. At even later
times the field strength throughout the inter-shock region is close to its original strength. The gas in the core
remains hot and diffuse, with magnetic field strength
considerably weaker than outside the core.
Figure 3 shows the radial evolution of the shockwave
for the HD, weakly magnetized and strongly magnetized
remnants. The HD remnant has a single characteristic
length; the shockwave radius, since the shockwave and
core are coupled. This shows good agreement with the
analytical solution of Cioffi et al. (1988) for a spherically
symmetric model. Shock wave radii are near identical
for all models, parallel to the magnetic field. The weakly
magnetized remnant behaviour in Figure 3 closely resembles that of the HD remnant. However, perpendicular to the strongly magnetized field the shockwaves diverge from the other profiles near t = 100 kyr and propagate faster.
Given the ubiquity of magnetic fields in the ISM, it
is reasonable to anticipate spheroid morphology to be
common in SN remnants. This may be useful in understanding the 3D structure of observed remnants. For
example, G351.0-5.4, discovered in de Gasperin et al.
(2014) is modelled in first approximation as spherical.
This may be reasonable for observations of the shell,
which from our models appears only slightly oblate, but
misleading for the remnant core. Alternatively, comparisons of gamma-ray and radio data around remnant
W44 (Cardillo et al. 2014) indicate a smaller spheroid
in gamma-ray emission with polar radius offset from the
surrounding spheroid in radio emission, and the presence
of magnetic field in the shock B ≥ 102 µG. Complex interaction with molecular clouds and the turbulent ISM
affect the morphology of the remnant, but the intershock region may also be part of the explanation for the
misalignment in the observational profiles.
Modelling the local bubble of the Milky Way with a
prolate sphere Alves et al. (2018) find this a reasonable
fit even for the magnetic shell. In contrast to our findings, they determine the remnant field to be vertical,
out of alignment to the neighbourhood galactic field,
and highly anisotropic between North and South. Perhaps, however, an oblate spheroid shell with polar axis
parallel to the galactic plane would be an alternative
model consistent with the galactic magnetic field.
Any speculation about how our results relate to observational features, are of course at this stage highly
tentative. The large scale alignment of magnetic fields
in the ISM will surely not be uniform on scales of a few
parsecs. The structure of the turbulent magnetic field,
the stratification and inhomogeneity of the gas density
and temperature, and the turbulent motion of the ambient ISM will be considered in future work, let alone the
effects of chemistry and ionization on the observational

signatures. Anisotropy of SN remants may of course also
arise independent of magnetic effects.
4. MOMENTUM INJECTION

In a typical HD supernova explosion, the propagation
of the shock, and subsequent momentum injection into
the surrounding medium, is dominated by the thermal
pressure gradients, which evacuate mass from the core
into the blastwave. In a very similar physical set up to
ours, Kim & Ostriker (2015) find the SN terminal momentum injection to be about 4×105 M km s−1 , defined
by
Z
M un =
ρ (u · n̂) dV,
(6)
V

where n̂ is the radial unit vector from the centre of the
SN explosion.
We consider this calculation with a modification to
account for non-spherical expansion of the SN remnant.
The most general approach would be to adopt a tri-axial
ellipsoid profile. However in this case, the remnants
have two distinct length scales, the SNR radius parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, Rk and R⊥ ,

.

It can be shown that R⊥ = Rk leads to a spherical
remnant profile and n̂ = x̂.
With this definition for n̂ applied to Equation (6), we
obtain total momentum injection 3.3 × 105 M km s−1
for the HD remnant, similar to Kim & Ostriker (2015).
we plot the evolution of total momentum for the HD
and a range of MHD remnants in Figure 4 (a). As
the thermal pressure gradient reduces in the remnant
the pressure driven snowplough (PDS) transitions to
the momentum conserving snowplough (MCS), as described by Cioffi et al. (1988). It can seen that MCS
for the HD model initiates a little later than 2 Myr. A
transient MCS occurs much earlier (t ' 1 Myr) for the
strongly magnetized model, subsequentially losing momentum thereafter. As it might be argued that only
the outward momentum drives the ISM turbulence we
also calculate the outward momentum injection, M un |+ ,
which is plotted in Figure 4 (b).
There is a negligible difference between the HD and
weak MHD models, but for magnetic field strength
above 1 µG the momentumn injection diverges significantly from the HD. Contrasting panels (a) and (b)
it is evident that although HD remnants feature retrograde shocks, these carry negligible mass back towards
the core, while there is significant inward momentum for
the strong MHD shocks.
Kim & Ostriker (2015) find that momentum injection
ceases within two to three shell-forming times, before
the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the thermal
energy in the shell. Subsequently, they argue that magnetic effects will not lead to further momentum injection
by the remnant. However, from both panels in Figure 4
we find our strong MHD solutions (B0 = 3.0, 5.0µG)
diverge from the HD solution within 200 kyr. These
show non-monotonic evolution, reaching a local maximum (3.1 × 105 M km s−1 ) after 700 kyr followed by

decay. However, outward momentum injection becomes
steady after 2 Myr and levels off at 3 × 105 M km s−1 .
This suggests that momentum injection is reduced by
up to 10% in the presence of a large-scale plane-parallel
uniform magnetic field. Evirgen et al. (2019) show that
a Brms ∼ 3µG dynamo-evolved magnetic field, featuring a strong locally plane-parallel large-scale coherent
structure, leads to a decrease in vertical velocity profile.
An important contributing factor could be suppression
of momentum injection at the SN forcing scale, as seen
here.
To illustrate what is changing due to the strong MHD
we show radial profiles perpendicular to the magnetic

field at 1 Myr and 2 Myr in panels (a) and (b), respectively in Figure 5 of the magnetic field strength (top),
velocity (centre) and momentum (bottom).
Momentum in the shell of the HD remnant is a factor
of 4–6 higher and centered narrowly about the shock
front. The MHD shock in all profiles is broader, projectinq both in advance of the HD shock position and
including an extended weak inward momentum behind
the shock front. Even slowing below 10 km s−1 by 2 Myr
the MHD blast wave still remains supersonic. We find
that the blast wave remains supersonic even up to 4 Myr.
We see from that the magnetic field is swept up into the

the core over time.
In order to explore what are the magnetic effects that
increase the outward velocity, but inhibit the outward

consider the momentum equation perpendicular to B0 ,

where p denotes thermal pressure and D refers to diffusive terms in the equation. For our analysis, we are
interested in the interaction between the pressure gradient terms and the magnetic tension term on the right
hand side of the equation.
For the strong MHD model Figure 6 shows the forces
applying perpendicular to B0 at t = 1 Myr, Panel (a)
and t = 2 Myr (b). Interestingly, the very large thermal
pressure gradient extending through the inner core to
about 40 pc at 1 Myr is confined to only 30 pc by 2 Myr.
A negative thermal pressure gradient does evolve int he
wake of the shock, and this is true also for the HD remnant. However this is too remote from the core to account for its confinement late on.
Magnetic effects
gradually become dominant at the blastwave, primarily the magnetic pressure gradients, where the outward
magnetic pressure gradient is comparable to the thermal gradient at t = 1 Myr, and 2–3 times greater at
t = 2 Myr. However, the negative pressure gradient in

the wake of the shock appears to be the most interesting. The negative force applies throughout the intershock region, between the primary blast wave and the
inner thermal pressure front. The magnetic pressure
force peels mass away from the remnant shell and drives
it inwards along with some of the magnetic field. This
broadens the mass shell profile we see from Figure 1 and
the magnetic field profile from Figure 5 (top panels) and
provides the substantive forces confining the remnant
core compared to HD. For most of the 60 < R⊥ < 90 pc
region by 2 Myr the magnetic pressure gradient dominates the thermal pressure gradient. Magnetic tension
is subdominant perpendicular to the magnetic field.
5. THERMODYNAMICS OF MHD REMNANTS

The effect of confinement of the remnant core by the
inward magnetic pressure gradient is to reduce adiabatic
cooling compared to HD. The system is non-adiabatic,
so how does the redistribution of mass in the strong
MHD case affect its thermal properties? Snapshots of
the net heating, ∆H = T −1 (Γ − ρΛ), are presented in
Figure 7 for the HD model, Panel (a), and strong MHD
model, (b). In the HD and weak MHD models, cooling
dominates everywhere in the remnant, except for a thin

model cooling dominates in the confined remnant inner

Figure 1 (a) this applies for 35 . R⊥ . 60 pc.
In Figure 8 we show the probability density functions
(PDFs) of temperature, (a), and gas density, (b). Each
panel features the respective PDFs for models with B0 =
0, 0.5 and 5 µG at t = 2 Myr. All models have identical
initial temperature and gas density distributions. The
peaks at T ' 260 K and ρ ' 1.67 g cm−3 identify the
ambient ISM. For the HD model and model with B0 =
0.5µG, the differences in the PDFs are otherwise also
negligible. The other local maxima identify the cold
remnant shell (n > 10 cm−3 , T < 100 K), the hot diffuse
core (n < 0.01 cm−3 , T > 105 K), and the accumulation
of thermally stable warm gas (n ' 0.1 cm−3 , T ' 104 K).
However, with the strong magnetic field the peak temperatures representing the remnant shell and the remnant cores are hotter and more dense. Its magnetically
confined hot gas has a smaller fractional volume. Hot
gas in all models cools slowly, due to the low density,
but the strong MHD hot gas cools due to radiative losses
relatively faster due to its slightly higher density. It nevertheless remains hotter, because the adiabatic cooling
is reduced. The strong MHD model has almost identical
temperature distribution in the range 104 < T < 105 K,
although more dense.

6. RESIDUAL SN ENERGY INJECTION

Inspection of the momentum injection indicates the
magnetic field can reduce the residual momentum appled to the ISM by an SN remnant. The increased mass
of hot gas, on the other hand and reduced effect of nonadiabatic cooling within an MHD remnant invites the
question how are the energetics of the ISM affected by
a strong magnetic field? The time evolution of residual
SN total energy and each contribution to the energy are
plotted in Figure 11.
Panel (a) shows that a significant increase in residual
total energy occurs with strong MHD even within 1 Myr
of the supernova explosion.
From Panel (b) we see that the presence of largescale magnetic fields retains more residual thermal en-

ergy, while Panel (c) shows that kinetic energy in the
MHD remnants is lost more quickly. Beyond 3 Myr the
strong MHD residual kinetic energy can persist more effectively than HD, would likely be subsumed by the ambient ISM turbulence by this time. For all MHD models
there is a modest linear amplification of the magnetic
field trhough compression and tangling (Panel (d)). So
the net contributions of thermal and magne sutic energy
mean that the MHD shocks in fact induce a greater total
residual energy into the ISM than HD alone.
The effects are tabulated for each model at various
times throughout their evolution in Table 1. Differences
emerge with HD within 250 kyr of the SN explosion for

strong MHD models. The 3µG and 5µG models retain 6% and 11% more energy, rising to 10% and 20%
within 500 kyr. The HD simulation retains 1.3% of SN
energy by the end of the simulation. As magnetic field
strength increases, the SN energy retained by the system
increases, reaching 4.2% for B0 = 5µG.

7. CRITICAL MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH

Any qualitative differences between the HD and MHD
remnants must arise from effects due to the Lorentz
force. Inspection of the evolution of magnetic tension
reveals this to be negligible, relative to the magnetic
and thermal pressure gradients. The maximal tension
forces apply in the remnant shell nearest the polar axis
of the remnant.
Therefore, modification to momentum injection relies
on the interacting radial pressure
 gradients, particularly
where ∂⊥ (p) ' ∂⊥ |B|2 /2µ0 . In the blast wave the
magnetic gradient will grow due to compression. The
stronger the ambient field, the earlier the magnetic gradient in the shell and in its wake will acquire a critical
strength sufficient to significantly modify the remnant
evolution. The MHD shell begins to shed mass into its
wake, compared to HD as early as 200 kyr for B0 = 5µG,
320 kyr for 3µG and 920 kyr for 1µG. The leading shock
outstrips the HD model at 440, 560 and 1560 kyr, respectively. From both panels in Figure 6 throughout the
inter-shock region we have

∂⊥ |B|2 /2µ0 |−
& 1,
∂⊥ (p) |+

but when the MHD shock profiles start to diverge from
HD this ratio locally is still much less than 1. A reasonable criteria for identifying the critical large-scale
magnetic field strength
may be to assume plasma-β <1.
√
Hence, Bcrit ∼ 2µ0 p, where p = kB nT ; kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T denotes temperature.
For these simulations the ambient ISM has n = 1 cm−3
and T ' 260 K. Thus, the gas is in thermal equilibrium with radiative cooling balancing UV heating. We
show in Appendix C that the results are not sensitive
to the initial ambient temperature, which cools very
quickly to the equilibrium temperature to evolve with
the same remnant properties. We obtain Bcrit ∼ 1 µG.
B0 = 1µG does lead to marginal MHD effects. In agreement with Hanayama & Tomisaka (2006), we find that
significant change to the nature of the remnant is seen
for B0 ≥ 3µG. However, the effect of cooling and heating processes are highly nonlinear functions of density,
so we shall explore how to explain critical field strength
with various ambient ISM densities and magnetic field
configurations.
8. SUMMARY

The merger of the remnant shell with the surrounding gas depends on a number of factors, including but
not limited to, ambient sound speed, homogeneity (or
inhomogeneity) of the ambient gas density structures,
and interaction with other shocks in a turbulent, highly
compressible and typically inhomogeneous interstellar
medium. However, the emergence of differences in energy retention, directly linked to the presence of largescale magnetic fields, suggests that the efficiency with

11

MHD supernova explosions
which the surrounding gas extracts energy from SN remnants is modified by magnetic fields.
A plane-parallel, micro-gauss strength magnetic field
changes the aspect ratio of SN remnants. The shockwave through the ambient ISM propagates faster perpendicular to the magnetic field. Figure 15 of Caunt &
Korpi (2001) show a similar MHD remnant expanding
faster perpendicular to the plane-parallel field. This is
also identified by Ferriere et al. (1991) in the context
of a superbubble blast wave. They also report that the
MHD blast is faster in the parallel direction than for HD.
Conversely, the hot diffuse remnant core is magnetically
confined into a prolate spheroid with pole aligned to the
field. Hanayama & Tomisaka (2006); Kim & Ostriker
(2015) also find that expansion of the core is inhibited
perpendicular to a plane-parallel magnetic field.
Both effects are caused by the magnetic pressure gradients perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the adiabatic and pressure driven phases of the blast wave expansion, while magnetic forces are weak relative to the
explosive forces, magnetic field is expelled from the core
and compressed into the shell. Some energy from the
thermally driven outward shock is stored in the highly
compressed field at the remnant shell, to be released
through the magnetic pressure gradient in the late MHD
shock. Compression also generates an increasingly negative magnetic pressure gradient just behind the shell,
ultimately injecting momentum inwards.
In similar simulations, which focus on the early (up to
400 kyr) stage of SN evolution, Kim & Ostriker (2015)
conclude that momentum injection by an SN remnant
is unaffected by the presence of a plane-parallel magnetic field. They suggest magnetic fields will not affect
momentum injection, because they do not become comparable to thermal effects before the remnant enters the
momentum-conserving phase. In contrast we do find for
B0 ≥ 3µG a substantial effect on outward momentum
injection already within 500 kyr, which could be reduced
by up to 10% in the presence of a large-scale magnetic
field. Given the role of SN in driving both turbulent
and large-scale flows (such as galactic winds), such a reduction in momentum injection could have a noticeable
effect on gas dynamics within galaxies.
MHD effects also lead to confinement of the hot core
and a more dense inter-shock region. UV-heating exceeds radiative losses in this region and, combined with
the magnetic broadening of the shock front, inhibits the
formation of cold gas, compared to HD. This results in a
region of thermally unstable warm gas, which will eventually merge with the surrounding gas. In contrast to
the reduced momentum injection the residual energy of
an MHD SN remnant can be up to 40% greater within
1 Myr. This, however, corresponds to a reduced fractional volume of hot gas, an effect also noted by Evirgen et al. (2019). Even though we obtain this result in
an idealized numerical setup, Evirgen et al. (2019) find
that hot gas becomes more dense in numerical simula-

tions of the local Galaxy, as the magnetic field reaches
Brms ∼ 3µG strength with a strong large-scale component. These numerical simulations feature highly inhomogeneous gas density, compressible turbulence and a
multi-phase ISM structure. Thus, it is plausible that
our remnant-scale simulations may relate to magnetic
effects found in more sophisticated numerical models.
In its early stages the presence of a magnetic field
has negligible effect on SN remnant evolution, and this
is consistent with the results of Kim & Ostriker (2015).
However, as the magnetic shell forms increasingly strong
local pressure gradients the dynamics alter markedly.
For sufficiently weak magnetic fields this may evolve
so late that the blast wave has already merged with
the ISM and it remains dynamically insignificant. For
stronger fields the magnetic retrograde shock and late
MHD shock occur sufficiently early to alter remnant
momentum injection and structure. For gas density
n = 1 cm−3 , we find the critical field strength to correspond to plasma-β = 1 in the ambient ISM. The
magnetic confinement and late MHD shock occur earlier and are stronger as B0 increases within the range
1 ≤ B0 ≤ 5µG considered. With respect to structure,
this is consistent with Hanayama & Tomisaka (2006),
who find notiecable magnetic confinement of the remnant interior for B0 ≥ 3µG, and Kim & Ostriker (2015)
for B0 = 7.2µG.
Magnetic fields in the ISM are not uniform as applied
in these models and planned studies shall include the
effects of turbulent structure of the magnetic field and a
range of ambient ISM density. Nevertheless, it is widely
observed that spiral galaxies have a large-scale, coherently structured magnetic field of strength in the range
1–30 µG (Beck 2001; Tabatabaei et al. 2008; Fletcher
et al. 2011). Thus, it is plausible that SN remnants
evolve subject to the magnetic effects described here,
which could have significant implications on pressure
support, mass loading of the galactic halo, and generally
the multiphase and vertical structure of the ISM.

APPENDIX
A. IDENTIFYING NUMERICAL EFFECTS THROUGH 1D SHOCK-TUBE TESTS

To verify that the significant qualitative effects we identify from the MHD blast waves are attributable to the
physics rather than the numerics, we examine the impact of employing artificial diffusivities compared to the impact of
a magnetic field on the solutions. For numerical economy we use a set of 1D shock-tube tests. The numerical solutions
for adiabatic shocks with parameters relevant to SN blast waves are compared to the system originally described by
Sod (1978), and its exact analytical solution derived by Hawley et al. (1984). We extend the analysis applied to the
HD solutions of Gent et al. (2019) to consider specifically whether MHD or numerical effects account for the differences
in the MHD solutions
Figure 12 shows that for an adiabatic shock the HD numerical solution reliably produces the analytic solution. Even
the MHD solution has only marginally enhanced gas density in the shock. Hence, neither numerical parameters nor
the presence of the magnetic field have a significant effect on the solution in the adiabatic system, and this is consistent
with most previous assessments.
We next consider the effect radiative cooling and UV heating on the shock-tube solution. In Figure 13 the nonadiabatic HD and MHD numerical solutions are contrasted to the adiabatic analytic solution. We do not have a
non-adiabatic analytic shock-tube solution. The inclusion of cooling and heating processes has a noticeable effect on
both HD and MHD shock tubes; both shocks propagate more slowly through the ambient gas. This is not unexpected,
since these processes extract energy which would otherwise be used up in the propagation of the shock. We note that
the MHD shock propagates faster than the HD shock, as also seen in the 3D simulations presented in this Paper.
The gas density behind the shock tube is higher than the standard set up for both HD and MHD shock tubes with
cooling and heating. However, as seen in the 3D simulations, the gas density is higher behind the shock for the MHD
shock tube. In addition, the shock density is lower in the MHD shock. This is evidence that the nonlinear interaction
between the MHD and non-adiabatic effects is a significant factor in the divergence of the HD and MHD solutions.
For the 1D shock-tube tests an artificial shock-dependent mass diffusion is unnecessary, but we include it in these
experiments to verify that its inclusion in SN-driven turbulence simulations does not induce excessive numerical
diffusion. We consider a range of mass shock diffusivity ζD ∈ [0, 10]fshock . From Figure 14 we show that adding mass

diffusion, while providing numerical stability, produces a minor quantitative difference in the gas density shock profile.
The profiles are otherwise qualitatively the same and the contrast with the HD profile is clearly down to the presence
of the magnetic effects rather than the mass diffusion. A remaining concern is that the broadening of the mass profile
in the MHD blast wave may arise from the high value of the viscosity, ν = ν0 with ν0 = 0.0005cs kpc km s−1 in the 3D
SN blast waves. Although the estimates of microscopic viscosity in the real ISM are orders of magnitude lower, the
viscosity in the model represents instead a turbulent viscosity. To model turbulence we require this dissipation scale
applies above the grid scale, but sufficiently below the SN forcing scale to accurately capture the energy spectrum down
to the smallest scales of interest in the model. We vary ν = [ν0 , 2ν0 , 4ν0 , 8ν0 , 16ν0 ] with ζD = 2fshock kpc km s−1 and
η = 0.0008 kpc km s−1 for the non-adiabatic 1D shock-tube tests. This also effectively changes the magnetic Prandtl
number in the MHD simulations, defined as Pm = ν/η, which yields Pm = [0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10] cs . Given that in
these solutions cs  1 km s−1 , we also have Pm  1
Some resulting density profiles are shown in Figure 15. Both HD and MHD are affected similarly by increasing
viscosity. The shock front does not propagate as fast for higher values of ν and the region behind the shock is
smoothed. However both HD and MHD shocks are not affected qualitatively as viscosity is increased. The difference
between the HD and MHD solutions cannot be explained by high diffusivity.
B. CHANGING THE AMBIENT GAS DENSITY

There is a significant change to the HD SN evolution when a moderately strong uniform magnetic field is embedded
in the ambient ISM. We conclude that this is in part due to the alteration of the radiative cooling and UV-heating
characterstics in response to the retrograde flow of gas into the remnant. The cooling and heating profile of the ISM
is highly sensitive to the gas density and temperature. We would like to explore the response to varying ambient
ISM density in the 3D MHD SN remnant evolution in future work, but here we perform a preliminary low budget
experiment with 1D shock-tube tests of varying ambient gas density. We apply ambient gas number density, n0 =
10−2 , 10−1 , 1, 10, 100 cm−1 to assess whether the magnetic effects described in this Paper may be generalised beyond
1 cm−3 . The range of densities chosen reflect the range from diffuse, hot gas to dense, cold gas. The initial entropy of

the ambient gas is adjusted such that the ambient temperature remains constant with net heating at zero appropriate
to the initial gas density. Specfic gas entropy is expressed as
s = cV [ln T − (γ − 1) ln ρ] ,
with T and ρ expressed in dimensionless code units, γ = 5/3 is the adiabatic index, and cV is the specific heat capacity.
Some initial configuration is represented by T0 , ρ0 and,
s0 = cV [ln T0 − (γ − 1) ln ρ0 ] .
We change the gas density such that ρ1 = kρ0 , where k > 0, but keep the temperature constant, such that T0 = T1 .
The two entropies, the new entropy s1 can be related to the old value s0 :
s1 = s0 + cV (γ − 1) [ln ρ0 − ln kρ0 ] ,
s1 = s0 + cV (1 − γ) ln k.

(B1)

We use this expression to change gas density while keeping initial temperature constant. In Figure 16, we present
the time profiles of distance travelled by the non-adiabatic shock (analogous to remnant shell radius) for a range of
ambient gas densities. The effect of the magnetic field is measured by the difference between the profiles for HD and
MHD shocks of identical ambient gas density. As in the 3D SN simulations, divergence of the MHD shock profile from
the HD profile indicates the effect of magnetic field. We find that the effect of the magnetic field increases as the
ambient density becomes more diffuse, due to decreasing plasma-β. Magnetic effects are seen for all ambient densities
apart from n = 100 cm−3 . Magnetic effects appear earlier in the lower ambient gas densities.
C. TEMPERATURE OF THE AMBIENT GAS

In our simulations, we set the ambient gas temperature T0 = 260 K, to ensure that the SN explosion is set off
with an ambient medium in thermal equilibrium. This particular temperature is chosen as the radiative cooling and

(right column) to the magnetic field. The radial profiles shown here are taken at t = 2 Myr.

UV-heating balance each other, yielding zero net heating in the ambient gas. However, T0 ∼ 104 K is a more typical
temperature for the ISM, particularly for ambient gas number density , n0 ∼ 0.1 cm−3 . Using this low density would
substantially increase the numerical domain size and computational expense. We, therefore, run a 3D SN simulation
identical to the MHD remnant simulation with B0 = 5µG and n0 = 1 cm−3 , but with T0 = 104 K.
Figure 17 shows that the radial profiles of gas density and temperature are qualitatively identical and quantitatively
very similar at 2 Myr. The re-distribution of mass from the shell to the interior of the remnant occurs in both
models, forming the inter-shock region between the magnetically confined diffuse core and the shell, in the direction
perpendicular to the magnetic field.
Moreover, the PDFs of gas temperature and density provided in Figure 18, which are given at 400 kyr, 1 Myr and
2 Myr, show that the temperature distributions converge despite the different initial temperatures. The hottest gas is
identical from an early stage, as it is injected by the SN remnant, irrespective of the initial ambient gas temperature.
In the cooler range, the modal temperature of the gas, for the 104 K model, gradually converges to the 260 K model,
for which the ambient gas is in thermal equilibrium from the beginning of the simulation. We see that the lower peak
in the temperature PDF, corresponding to the ambient ISM, cools over time, reaching thermal equilibrium peak by
2 Myr. Evidently, the difference to the thermal pressure gradient form the higher temperature is negligible.
Figure 19 shows the evolution of remnant radius perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. Panel (b) shows
that the HD model and both MHD models agree with the Cioffi et al. (1988) analytical solution. The radius of the
104 K MHD model is marginally (within 2 pc) less than the 260 K model. Panel (a) shows that both MHD models
have an identical time profile for the radius perpendicular to the magnetic field.
