Abstract
We study the generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to a 1 + 1 dimensional
chiral SYK model of N flavors of right-moving chiral Majorana fermions with all-to-all random
4-fermion interactions. The interactions in this model are exactly marginal, leading to an exact
scaling symmetry. We show the Schwinger-Dyson equation of this model in the large N limit is
exactly solvable. In addition, we show this model is integrable for small N ≤ 6 by bosonization.
Surprisingly, the two point function in the large N limit has exactly the same form as that for
N = 4, although the four point functions of the two cases are quite different. The ground state
entropy in the large N limit is the same as that of N free chiral Majorana fermions, leading
to a zero ground state entropy density. The OTOC of the model in the large N limit exhibits
a non-trivial spacetime structure reminscent of that found by Gu and Kitaev [1] for generic
SYK-like models. Specifically we find a Lyapunov regime inside an asymmetric butterfly cone,
which are signatures of quantum chaos, and that the maximal velocity dependent Lyapunov
exponent approaches the chaos bound 2π/β as the interaction strength approaches its physical
upper bound. Finally, the model is integrable for (at least) N ≤ 6 but chaotic in the large
N limit, leading us to conjecture that there is a transition from integrability to chaos as N
increases past a critical value.

Introduction

The last few years have seen an enormous amount of activity around the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)
model [2–5]. This activity is a consequence of the confluence of several themes. First, the model
is partially solvable in a tractable large N limit which it shares with the class of so-called tensor
models [6–8] and the literature on dynamical mean field theory. This large N limit is distinct
from the large N limits of vector and matrix models. Second, the SYK model exhibits many
body quantum chaos or ergodicity as can be seen by computing the four point out of time order
correlator (OTOC) in the same large N limit. This has fed into the current intense interest in such
foundational questions in quantum statistical mechanics. Finally, features of the model suggest
that it is the holographic dual to some theory of quantum gravity in 1 + 1 dimensions, and the
prospect of a solvable model of holography has naturally excited enormous interest.
The SYK Model lives in 0 + 1 dimensions—it is essentially a model on a quantum dot—and
various authors have considered extensions to higher dimensions. One family of extensions builds
higher dimensional models out of lattices of SYK dots, and this has led to interesting results on
transport and on non-Fermi liquid behavior [9–16]. A second family of extensions involves nonchiral
homogeneous models with interactions in the new large N limit which can be viewed either as arising
from random couplings or from tensorial fields [17–22]. In particular, the random extension to 1 + 1
dimensional nonchiral fermions shows marginally irrelevant SYK interactions [19]. In this paper
we present a third extension, this time to a homegenous chiral system in 1 + 1 dimensions, where
we study the resulting chiral SYK model at large N .
Before turning to our model, we briefly recapitulate some aspects of the original Sachdev-YeKitaev (SYK) model [2–5]. This model contains N Majorana fermions ψi , which have all-to-all
q-fermion random interactions, where q ≥ 2 is an even number. The 0 + 1 ≡ 1d action of the SYK
model is

where Ji1 ···iq are a set of random Gaussian couplings satisfying hJi21 ···iq i = J 2 (q − 1)!/N q−1 . In
the large N limit, the SYK model has a large ground state entropy due to the existence of highly
degenerate spin glass like states. At low temperatures, an asymptotic conformal symmetry emerges
from the collection of those states. The conformal symmetry is weakly broken and the corresponding
soft mode physics is captured by a Schwarzian action. The low temperature dynamics governed
by this action has been argued to be maximally chaotic or scrambled. In this context this means
that the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) grow as 1 − N1 eλ(t−t0 ) with time t and that the
2

Lyapunov exponent λ approaches the so-called “chaos bound”1 2π/β, where β is the inverse of
temperature [23–25]. It turns out that the Schwarzian action can also be viewed as emergent from
the description of Near Extremal Black Holes when we consider gravitational dynamics near the
AdS2 throat [26–30]. In the gravitational system, the black hole horizon provides a large ground
state degeneracy and the conformal symmetry is the asymptotic symmetry of AdS2 . With the
Schwarzian action, the SYK model provides a concrete example of holographic dual system for
near extremal black holes, although it is not clear whether the full model has an exact gravitational
dual. Many striking conclusions about near extremal black holes have been drawn from this duality,
such as the construction of a traversable wormhole [31–33] and black hole level statistics [34–36].
Turning now to our paper, we present a generalization of the SYK model to N flavors of 1 + 1
dimensional chiral Majorana fermions with all-to-all interactions (see action (2.1)), which we call
the chiral SYK model. The interactions are uniform in the spacetime and random with respect
to fermion flavors. Since fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions have a scaling dimension 1/2, any q > 4
fermion interactions will be irrelevant, so we only focus on the q = 4 fermion interactions. From
the perspective of Hibert space dimension, the model we study here is the minimal generalization
of the SYK model into higher spacetime dimensions. In condensed matter physics, chiral fermions
can exist on the edge of 2 + 1 dimensional gapped chiral topological states, and can interact with
each other on the edge. For instance, chiral complex fermions occur on the edge of integer quantum
Hall states [37, 38] or Chern insulators [39, 40], each of which is equivalent to two chiral Majorana
fermions. Odd number of chiral Majorana fermions can be realized on the edge of non-Abelian
fractional quantum Hall states [41], p + ip chiral topological superconductors [42, 43] or chiral spin
systems [44].
Unlike nonchiral systems, the 4-fermion interactions of 1 + 1 dimensional chiral fermions are
generically exactly marginal. Besides, such 4-fermion interactions break the Lorentz symmetry
explicitly, since the product of 4 chiral fermion fields has conformal spin 2 instead of zero. For
example, in the celebrated chiral Luttinger model [45–47] of two complex chiral fermions, the 4fermion interaction leads to a spin-charge velocity separation independent of energy scale, which
is therefore exactly marginal; meanwhile, the Lorentz symmetry is absent since spin and charge
excitations have different velocities. In our 1+1 dimensional chiral SYK model in the large N limit,
the 4-fermion interactions are also exactly marginal and break the Lorentz symmetry. We show
this explicitly by solving the two point function of the model exactly. Therefore, all the features of
our model are energy scale independent.
The exact marginality of 4-fermion interactions in our chiral SYK model leads to a scaling
symmetry, which enables us to solve the model exactly. In polar coordinates reiθ = τ + ix of
imaginary time τ and spatial position x, the scaling symmetry restricts the zero temperature
two point function to be proportional to r−1 , therefore the 1 + 1 dimensional Schwinger-Dyson
equations in the large N limit reduce to 1 dimensional equations in the boost angle θ, which are
exactly solvable. The exact two point function at finite temperature β −1 can also be obtained by
observations based on the zero temperature solution. We find that the two point function in real
space takes a form of the product of two 0 + 1 dimensional SYK propagators in the conformal
limit moving at two different velocities u± determined by the interaction strength (u+ > u− > 0).
With the exact solution, we calculate the ground state entropy by directly evaluating the large N
effective action (4.42), and find it is the same as the ground state entropy of N flavors of free chiral
Majorana fermions. Depending on the spatial boundary condition, the ground state entropy could
be either 0 (periodic boundary condition) or N log 2 (anti-periodic boundary condition, which has

N zero modes). In any case, the ground state entropy density vanishes, so there are no spin-glass
like states in the model. We also investigate the behavior of the OTOC using the retarded kernel
method in [4, 5], and identify a tilted butterfly cone where the OTOC grows exponentially along a
space-time trajectory with fixed velocity. The butterfly cone exactly coincides with the causality
cone, which has edges at velocities u+ and u− (Figure 10(e)). The butterfly cone can be further
divided into three regions which behave differently: for the region with
h small velocity

in the middle of butterfly cone, the 1/N piece of the OTOC grows as exp λt − #(t−v

(where u− → 0), the Lyapunov exponent λ approaches the chaos bound 2π/β. For the

region near the right butterfly cone edge, the 1/N piece of OTOC grows as exp 2π
(t

where the exponent in the t direction saturates the chaos bound 2π/β. A similar saturation of the
chaos bound near the butterfly edge was observed in [9], and recently explained on generic grounds
by [1] using the ladder identity. However, we note that this is not the case near the left butterfly
edge of our model, where the exponent in the t direction is −2π/β, i.e., opposite to the chaos
bound value. It is interesting that our model has both vanishing ground state entropy density and
maximal Lyapunov exponent when the interaction strength approaches its upper bound, which is
not a feature expected from black holes.
We also study the model at small finite N . In particular, in the cases N = 4, 5 and 6, the model
is seen to be integrable by bosonization. The N = 4 model is nothing but the chiral Luttinger
model with two complex fermions, which has a spin-charge separation. Surprisingly, we find that
the N = 4 fermion two point function is exactly of the same form as the large N two point function.
We conjecture that this coincidence may be due to the fact that the model has an SO(N ) symmetry
for both N = 4 and in the large N limit (upon averaging over the random couplings). Together with
the scaling symmetry, the SO(N ) symmetry may already pin down the form of two point function.
Nevertheless, the four point function for N = 4 is completely different from that in the large N
limit. This is because the N = 4 case is integrable while the large N case is chaotic. As a result,
the four point function for N = 4 only has power-law or exponential decay (up to a background
constant from conserved charges), and is insensitive to time orderings. For N = 5, upon a flavor
basis rotation, the model decouples into an N = 4 model plus a free chiral Majorana fermion. For
N = 6, by a flavor basis rotation and bosonization, we can rewrite the model as three free chiral
bosons with three distinct velocities. For finite N ≥ 7, the model becomes much more complicated
and probably unsolvable. We conjecture that the model has a transition from integrablity to chaos
when N increases, and this transition probably happens between N = 6 and N = 7. This would
also be the transition from non-thermalization to thermalization among the N chiral Majorana
flavors. In chiral topological condensed matter systems, thermalization of chiral states on the edge
could affect the thermal measurements in experiments [48–51].
While the bosonization of the 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model has been attempted [52], we note
that our chiral SYK model for any N can always be written straightforwardly in the bosonized
representation. For N ≤ 6, it is advantageous to solve the model in the bosonized representation;
while in the large N limit, the fermion representation is more convenient.
The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2, we introduce the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK
model for general number of chiral Majorana fermion flavors N , and find the energy-momentum
tensor of the model. In Sec. 3, we solve the model for N = 4 via bosonization. We then calculate
the thermal quantities and the four point function for N = 4, and show the OTOC in this case
only has exponential decay. In Sec. 4, we investigate the chiral SYK model in the large N limit by
4

solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations exactly. Based on the exact two point function, we discuss
its thermal properties and ground state entropy, and examine the large N OTOC for signatures of
chaos and operator spreading. In section 5, we give the exact solutions for N = 5 and N = 6, and
discuss what might happen at N ≥ 7 and its consequence for thermalization. Finally, we briefly
summarize our results in Sec. 6.

The 1+1 dimensional chiral SYK model

In this section, we describe the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model of chiral Majorana fermions
which we will study in this paper. We will introduce the Lagrangian and the energy momentum
tensor of the model. In particular, the model requires a proper choice of point splitting regularization for the operator product expansion (OPE) of the chiral Majorana fermion fields, which we
will specify.

2.1

The Lagrangian

In 1 + 1 dimensions, a free chiral Majorana fermion field ψ has a scaling dimension 1/2, so a qfermion interaction term has a scaling dimension q/2, which is marginal if q = 4, and irrelevant if
q > 4. This was considered as a major obstacle in the generalization of the SYK model to 1 + 1
dimensions, since it is important to have the interaction relevant in the original 0 + 1 dimensional
SYK model. However, it is still worthwhile to examine the effect of the marginal random 4-fermion
interaction in 1 + 1 dimensions, and whether some features of the SYK model are preserved.
In this paper, we study the direct generalization of the q = 4 SYK model to N flavors of 1 + 1
dimensional right-moving chiral Majorana fermions ψi (1 ≤ i ≤ N ), which has the action


where ψi satisfies the anticommutation relation {ψi (t, x), ψj (t, x0 )} = δij δ(x − x0 ), and L denotes
the Lagrangian density. The couplings Jijkl are real, and antisymmetric with respect to any two
indices. In the large N case, we assume Jijkl obey the random Gaussian distribution with
hJijkl i = 0 ,
hJijkl Ji0 j 0 k0 l0 i =

(i < j < k < l, i0 < j 0 < k 0 < l0 ) ,

(2.2)

where the coupling strength J ≥ 0 is kept constant when we take the large N limit. Note that here
Jijkl is only random with respect to Majorana fermion flavor indices, while is uniform in the entire
spacetime. This is fundamentally different from the chiral interactions studied in [10] which are
spatially disordered. As we shall show, the spacetime uniform 4-fermion interaction Jijkl we study
here is exactly marginal, thus is important at all energy scales.
The chiral 4-fermion interactions Jijkl explicitly break the Lorentz symmetry, and thus also
break the conformal symmetry. This is because the chiral Majorana fermion ψi carries a conformal
spin 1/2, thus the 4-fermion interaction term has a nonzero conformal spin 2 and is not Lorentz
5

invariant. The absence of Lorentz symmetry is, however, not a problem in condensed matter
systems. For example, the N chiral Majorana fermions can live on the edge of N copies of the
2 + 1d p + ip chiral topological superconductor, which has no intrinsic Lorentz symmetry.
The Euler-Lagrange equation of motion of the action (2.1) can be easily found to be

i(∂t + ∂x )ψi +
Jijkl ψj ψk ψl = 0 .

(2.3)

1≤j<k<l≤N

Throughout this paper, we will work in both real time t and imaginary time τ = it, depending on
which one is more convenient.

2.2

Point splitting regularization and the energy momentum tensor

In quantum field theories (QFTs), the product of quantum fields at the same spacetime coordinate
needs to be regularized carefully. The regularization is usually done by finding the operator product
expansion (OPE) of two fields at split spacetime points (t, x) and (t0 , x0 ), taking the limit t0 → t
and x0 → x, and keeping the normal ordered part of the limit. In QFTs without Lorentz invariance,
the regularization may depend on the direction of point splitting, so one needs to specify the point
splitting direction.
In this paper, we specify the point splitting to be in the x direction whenever we regularize
the product of field operators at the same spacetime point. Namely, for instance, we define the
product of two chiral Majorana fermion fields as ψi (t, x)ψj (t, x) = limx0 →x :ψi (t, x)ψj (t, x0 ):, where
:O: stands for the normal ordering of operator O. This point splitting choice is conventional in
condensed matter systems, where there is generically an ultraviolet (UV) cutoff in the x direction
(lattice constant, etc) playing the role of the point splitting. Such a point splitting in the x direction
leads to the commutation relation on a constant time slice
[(ψi ψj )(t, x), (ψk ψl )(t, x0 )]
i
= (δik δjl − δil δjk )∂x δ(x − x0 ) − δ(x − x0 )(δik ψj ψl − δil ψj ψk + δjl ψi ψk − δjk ψi ψl ) ,
2π

(2.4)

which can be derived from the OPE of free chiral Majorana fields ψi (Appendix A). Note that iψi ψj
(1 ≤ i < j ≤ N ) form the representation of the current operators of SO(N )1 , thus Eq. (2.4) is
nothing but the commutation relation of the SO(N )1 Kac-Moody algebra. For the model (2.1) to
be self-consistently defined, we require this commutation relation on a constant time slice to persist
when the chiral Majorana fermions ψi are no longer free (J > 0).

P Note that the kinetic term can also be written into the Sugawara
form, − 2i i ψi ∂x ψi = − Nπ−1 i<j :ψi ψj ::ψi ψj : (Appendix A). Therefore, the kinetic term and the
4-fermion interaction term ψi ψj ψk ψl are of the same 4-fermion form (with scaling dimension 2 and
conformal spin 2). This suggests that the interaction couplings Jijkl are exactly marginal, which we
will verify by calculations in the rest of our paper. This is in contrast to the nonchiral interaction
in the Thirring model, which is either marginally irrelevant (for large N ) [10] or marginally relevant
[53].

We can also derive the energy momentum tensor T µν of the model. By definition, T 00 has the
physical meaning of the energy density, so we have T 00 = H as given by Eq. (2.5). The energy
current T x0 can be derived from the energy conservation law ∂t T 00 + ∂x T x0 = i[H, H] + ∂x T x0 = 0.
Making use of the equation of motion (2.3), the commutation relation (2.4) and the correlation
(2.2), we can obtain the energy current averaged over all random couplings Jijkl (Appendix A)

Due to the absence of Lorentz symmetry at J > 0, the energy momentum tensor T µν is not a
symmetric tensor. We note that the expression of T µν depends on the choice of the point splitting
direction; here our results are for point splitting along the x direction.
In a gapped 2 + 1 dimensional condensed matter system with a chiral edge theory on its 1 + 1
dimensional edge, the energy current jE = hT x0 iβ as a function of temperature β −1 gives a thermal
Hall conductance κxy = ∂jE /∂(β −1 ). For scaling invariant edge theories, the energy current is of
the form jE = πc/12β 2 , and yields a thermal Hall conductance κxy = πc/6β, where c is a constant.
For conformal field theories (CFTs), c = cR − cL is the right-moving central charge cR minus the
left-moving central charge cL [54]. In our case, the chiral model (2.1) is a CFT of N free chiral
Majorana fermions when J = 0, which has cR = N/2 and cL = 0. Therefore, we conclude that our
model has κxy = N π/12β when J = 0. When J > 0, the model is no longer a CFT but is still
scaling invariant, and we need to calculate the coefficient c using Eq. (2.6).

Exact solution for N = 4 via bosonization

The 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model (2.1) with N = 4 flavors of chiral Majorana fermions
is integrable via bosonization, which is equivalent to the celebrated chiral Luttinger model with
spin-charge separation in condensed matter physics. N = 4 is also the minimal number of flavors
which allows a 4-fermion interaction. In this section, we review this exact solution for N = 4,
and examine the two point function and OTOC of ψi , as a representative of non-chaotic integrable
models. Furthermore, in Sec. 5 we shall show the model is also integrable for N = 5 and N = 6,
but is probably no longer integrable for all N ≥ 7.
Since there is only one coupling parameter J1234 for N = 4, it is meaningless to talk about the
distribution of Jijkl as defined by Eq. (2.2). Instead, we simply set J1234 = J ≥ 0 as a constant.
Note that this definition of J is consistent with that defined in Eq. (2.2) for N = 4.
√
It is convenient
to define two chiral complex fermion fields c↑ = (ψ1 + iψ2 )/ 2 and c↓ =
√
(ψ3 + iψ4 ) 2, distinguished by a spin index ↑ or ↓. The action (2.1) for N = 4 can then be
rewritten as


Z
X
S = dtdx i
c†σ (∂t + ∂x )cσ − Jn↑ n↓  ,
(3.1)
σ=↑,↓

7

where nσ = c†σ cσ is the spin σ fermion density. In this form, Eq. (3.1) is simply the chiral Luttinger
model, which can be exactly solved by bosonization and exhibits a spin-charge separation physics.
Physically, it could describe the edge of a Chern number ν = 2 quantum Hall state with a shortrange repulsive interaction.
We comment that the N = 4 action (3.1) has an SO(4) symmetry upon rotations among the
four chiral Majorana fields ψi [55, 56]. In contrast, there is generically no SO(N ) symmetry for
N ≥ 5 due to the presence of couplings Jijkl which are non-symmetric under SO(N ) rotations.
Therefore, the N = 4 model is more symmetric.

3.1

Bosonization of the action

Here we briefly review the bosonization procedure of the model action (3.1). The bosonization is
done by redefining the fermion operators in terms of vertex operators
cσ (t, x) = ησ eiφσ (t,x) ,

c†σ (t, x) = ησ† e−iφσ (t,x)

(σ =↑, ↓) ,

(3.2)

where φσ (t, x) are two scalar boson fields satisfying the commutation relation
[φσ (t, x), φσ0 (t, x0 )] = iπδσσ0 sgn(x − x0 ) ,

(3.3)

with sgn(x) denoting the sign of x. The coefficients ησ and ησ† are the Klein factors [57–59], which
recover the anti-commutation relation between different flavors of fermion fields, and do not appear
in fermion bilinears. By imposing a point splitting regularization in the x direction, one can derive
the following normal ordered identities in an OPE expansion (Appendix A):
nσ = c†σ cσ =

∂x φσ
,
2π

−ic†σ ∂x cσ =

(∂x φσ )2

The action (3.1) can then be bosonized into

Note that the action S only contains bilinears

two new boson fields φ± = (φ↑ ± φ↓ )/ 2, we can rewrite the action as

(3.7)

respectively. From this solution, we see that the Lorentz symmetry is indeed explicitly broken when
J > 0, since there are two different “speeds of light” u+ and u− . Besides, we also see that the
interaction J is exactly marginal as we expected, which simply modifies the boson velocities u± in
an energy scale independent way.

Eq. (3.7) also indicates a physical bound 0 ≤ J < 2π for the interaction strength J. This ensures
that both velocities u± are positive, and thus the total chirality of the model is kept invariant, as
shown in Fig. 1(a). If J > 2π, one would have the chirality of the boson field φ− flipped as
shown in Fig. 1(b), which is unphysical. This is because the action (3.1) is derived based on the
normal ordering assumption that all the k < 0 (k > 0) fermion states are occupied (empty); while
dispersions as shown in Fig. 1(b) would have both k < 0 and k > 0 occupied states and invalidate
the normal ordering assumption.

of the physical understanding of the J > 2π case when the chiral model (3.6) describes the edge of
a bulk gapped condensed matter system. The shaded area denotes the bulk states. For J > 2π, the
chirality of φ− is flipped at small k, but has to be reversed back at large k by UV nonlinearities,
so that the total chirality is preserved.
We may still try to understand what happens when J > 2π if the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK
model describes the edge theory of a bulk gapped 2 + 1 dimensional condensed matter system.
Physically, as long as the bulk gap does not close, the chirality of the edge should be preserved, as
protected by the (Bogoliubov-de Gennes) Chern number of the ground state in the bulk. In fact,
to understand the dispersion of J > 2π, one has to take into account the irrelevant nonlinearities
at high energies in a physical condensed matter system. For instance, a condensed matter system
always has a spatial UV cutoff `0 (lattice constant, etc), so one would expect the delta function
¯ − x0 )n↑ (x)n↑ (x0 ), and J =
interaction
Jn↑ n↓ to be smeared into a finite range `0 interaction J(x
R
¯

only describes the interaction at the low energy limit. The model is then no longer scaling
˜
invariant. This will modify the velocities of the two boson fields φ± into u± (k) = 1 ± J(k)/2π,
˜
where k is the momentum, and J(k) is the Fourier transform of J(x). Due to the cutoff `0 , one
−1
˜
˜
has J(k)
→ J when |k|  `−1
0 , and J(k) → 0 when |k| & `0 . Therefore, when J > 2π, the
dispersions of the edge chiral bosons up to very high energies will be as shown in Fig. 1(c), where
the shaded area stands for the bulk states. In particular, the velocity of φ− is negative near k = 0,
but goes back to positive when |k| & `−1
0 . Therefore, the ground state of J > 2π is severely changed
from that of J < 2π, and the low energy theory becomes three right-moving chiral bosons and one
left-moving chiral boson, which keeps the total chirality preserved but is no longer purely chiral.
In this paper, we shall only discuss interaction strengths J inside the physical bound 0 ≤ J < 2π,
so that we do not need to worry about any UV nonlinearities, and the model is purely chiral and
exactly scaling invariant. At zero temperature, the bosonic two point function (without time
ordering) of φα from the action (3.6) can be derived as


hφα (t, x)φα0 (0, 0)i = −δαα0 log 2πi(uα t − x − i0+ ) ,
(3.8)
where α, α0 = ±, and 0+ stands for a real positive infinitesimal number. Since the bosons are free,
9

their two point function at finite temperature β −1 can be derived by summing over all the zero
temperature two point functions at time t + imβ (m ∈ Z):

All the n point functions of boson fields φ± can then be obtained from the above two point function
and the Wick’s theorem.
The bosonic action (3.6) allows us to calculate the energy momentum tensor T µν and thermal
quantities in terms of boson fields φα . For instance, the energy density and energy current are

the x direction, and then take the limit  → 0. This leads to an energy density

In the bosonized representation here, different choice of point splitting direction in the above

Eq. (3.13) leads to a thermal Hall conductance κxy = ∂jE /∂(β −1 ) = π/3β. This is in agreement
with the expectation that a gapped condensed matter system with N flavors of chiral Majorana
fermions on the edge has a quantized thermal Hall conductance κxy = N π/12β [54], where N = 4
here. We can also derive the thermal entropy density S from β −1 [∂S/∂(β −1 )] = ∂E/∂(β −1 ), which

gives S = (π/6β)(u−1

Fermion two point function for N = 4

Since we are mainly interested in fermion correlation functions in this paper, it is useful to refermionize the above bosonized picture for N = 4. First, we derive the average fermion two point function
(without time ordering) at temperature β −1 , which is defined as

Wick’s theorem, one has he±iφσ (t,x) e∓iφσ (0,0) iβ = ehφσ (t,x)φσ (0,0)iβ , so the fermion two point function
can be derived as

where we have used the two point function of boson fields φ± = (φ↑ ± φ↓ )/ 2 in Eq. (3.9).
To verify Eq. (3.15) is the correct fermion two point function, we can calculate the finite
temperature energy density E = hT 00 iβ and energy current jE = hT x0 iβ in the fermion basis using
Gβ (t, x) in Eq. (3.15). By the expression of hT 00 iβ = H in Eq. (2.5) and the equation of motion
(2.3), we can rewrite the energy density as

This expression involves products of fermion fields at the same spacetime point, which therefore

performing a point splitting  in the x direction, the expression becomes a derivative of the two

although their vacuum −2 terms do not agree with those in Eqs. (3.11) and (3.12). This is because
fermions and bosons have different vacuum energies. We note that in the fermionic picture here, it
is important to have the point splitting direction in the x direction.

time t1 = 10β/π and t2 = 10β/π, respectively. (c) At late time t, The normalized OTOC F4 (t, x)
approaches −1 in the shaded region u− t < x < u+ t, and approaches 1 outside the region. This
shaded region is also the causal cone of the retarded Greens function for N = 4.
Fig. 2(a) shows normalized F4 (t, x) along the x = 0 direction, the t = 0 direction and the t = x
line when J = 1.2π. Fig. 2(b) shows the snapshot of normalized F4 (t, x) as a function of x at
fixed time t = 2β/π (green dashed-dotted line) and t = 10β/π (blue solid line), respectively. At
late time t, one can see that F4 (t, x) decays to −1 in the region u− t < x < u+ t as denoted by the
shaded area in Fig. 2(c), while decays to 1 in the regions x < u− t and x > u+ t. Along a direction
x = vt with velocity away from u− and u+ , the OTOC F4 (t, x) always decays exponentially in t
towards 1 or −1 for t & β. This can be seen more explicitly by noting that F4 (t, x) can be expanded
in nonnegative powers of the exponentially decaying function e−2πt/β . For integrable models, the
OTOCs have no fundamental difference from the TOCs.
12

We note that the shaded region u− t < x < u+ t in Fig. 2(c) is exactly the causal cone of the
model, which can be seen from the retarded fermion Green’s function

obtained by analytical continuation of the two point function (3.15). Therefore, the behavior of
the OTOC function F4 (t, x) is intuitively understandable. Outside the causal cone in the large t or
large x limit, the two ψi fields do not communicate with the two ψj fields, so F4 (t, x) tends to two
24
decoupled two point functions −G13
β Gβ , which is a constant. Inside the causal cone, one would
expect the correlations between the two ψi fields and the two ψj fields to be large, and the OTOC
F4 (t, x) should strongly deviate from the decoupled value outside the causal cone.

The chiral SYK model in the large N limit

Now we proceed to study the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model in the large N limit, and examine
its analogy and difference compared with the 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model. We show that the
two point function of chiral Majorana fermions is exactly solvable in the large N limit, and the
interaction strength J is exactly marginal. We will also show the model with a nonzero interaction
strength within the physical parameter range 0 < J < 2π is chaotic in the large N limit, and
its maximal velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent in the OTOC approaches the maximal chaos
bound 2π/β when J → 2π. The butterfly cone of the OTOC is asymmetric. For any 0 < J < 2π,
the time direction Lyapunov exponent at the right butterfly edge always saturates the chaos bound
2π/β, while at the left butterfly edge the time direction Lyapunov exponent is always −2π/β.

4.1

Schwinger-Dyson equation and two point function

In this subsection, we compute the two point function of the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model in
the large N limit by exactly solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation. For convenience, we will work in
Euclidean spacetime where the time τ = it is imaginary. Since the model is translationally invariant
in both space and time, its two point function G(−iτ1 , x1 ; −iτ2 , x2 ) = G[−i(τ1 − τ2 ), (x1 − x2 )] will
only depend on the spacetime coordinate difference of the two points. Here we define G(−iτ, x)
to be the imaginary time ordered two point Green’s function averaged over all Majorana fermion
flavors. For zero temperature, it is defined by
G(−iτ, x) ≡

where T stands for time ordering, τ = it is the imaginary time, ψi (τ, x) = eHτ ψi (x)e−Hτ is the

β −1 , the definition becomes

(4.2)

where Z = Tre−βH is the partition function, and T still represents time ordering. Due to the
anticommutation of fermions, the two point function satisfies the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition
G(−iτ, x) = −G(−iτ − iβ, x).
The analytical continuation of G(−iτ, x) allows us to derive different kinds of real time Green’s
functions. The real time two point function without time ordering G(t, x) can be obtained by
substituting τ → it + 0+ , namely, G(t, x) ≡PG(t − i0+ , x). In Sec. 4.3, we will need to use the
retarded Green’s function GR (t, x) = N −1 i h{ψi (t, x), ψi (0, 0)}i = Θ(t)[G(t − i0+ , x) − G(t +
i0+ , x)], and the Wightman function with half thermal circle separation defined by Glr (t, x) =
G(t − i β2 , x). Besides, the real-time ordered Green’s function (i.e., the Feynman propagator) is
given by GT (t, x) = G(t − i0+ sgn(t), x).

4.1.1

The zero temperature solution

We first solve the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the two point function G(−iτ, x) at zero temperature. As we will see, the scaling invariance allows us a short cut to obtain the zero temperature
solution exactly.
The imaginary-time ordered Green’s function of free chiral Majorana fermions at zero temperature can be easily derived to be

Figure 3: The melon diagrams which contribute to the two point function to the leading order of
1/N , which can be rewritten into the Schwinger-Dyson equation (4.5).
When the interaction strength J > 0, similar to the 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model, the two
point function G to the leading order of 1/N is contributed by the melon diagrams as shown in
Fig. 3. The solid lines and dashed lines in Fig. 3 denote the free two point function Gf and the
average over Jijkl , respectively. By defining a translationally invariant self energy Σ(−iτ, x), we
14

can summarize the Feynman diagams into the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the imaginary time
ordered two point function G and the self energy Σ:
1
= iωτ + k − Σ(iωτ , k) ,
G(iωτ , k)

Σ(−iτ, x) = J 2 [G(−iτ, x)]3 .

(4.5)

The scaling invariance of the action (2.1) tells us that G(−iωτ , k) and Σ(−iωτ , k) at zero temperature have scaling dimensions −1 and +1, respectively. Therefore, one cannot ignore the iωτ +k term
in the first equation of (4.5) in any cases, which has the same scaling dimension as Σ(iωτ , k). As a
consequence, the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model here does
not have a reparametrization symmetry, which is present at low energies in the 0 + 1 dimensional
SYK model Schwinger-Dyson equation because of the irrelevance of the iωτ term therein.
The exact scaling invariance, however, helps us constrain the form of G and Σ. By introducing
the polar coordinates (κ, θk ) in momentum space
ωτ + ik = κeiθk ,

(4.6)

we can write down the following ansatz for G and Σ based on their scaling dimensions:
Σ(iωτ , k) = κf (eiθk ) ,

G(iωτ , k) =

−i
1
,
−iθ
κ e k + if (eiθk )

(4.7)

where f (z) = −f (−z) is an odd function (corresponding to fermionic statistics) defined on the unit
complex circle |z| = 1. The unknown part of the two point function G and self energy Σ is only its
angular dependence on θk , which comes form the Lorentz symmetry breaking by the interaction J.
Note that the form of this ansatz already satisfies the first equation of Eq. (4.5).
The remaining task is to solve for the function f (z) from the second equation of Eq. (4.5). This
is an equation in real space, so we need to Fourier transform our ansatz (4.7). For convenience, we
also use polar coordinates (r, θ) for real space defined by
τ + ix = reiθ .

For now we assume the function f (z) in the unit disk |z| < 1 satisfies |zf (z)| < 1 and has
no intrinsic singularities or branch points. We will come back to verify this after we obtain the
solution of f (z). This assumption ensures that f (z) has at most one pole at z = 0, and the last
residue terms contributed by |ξ| < 1 in Eq. (4.10) and in Eq. (4.12) all vanish. Therefore, the
expressions of G(−iτ, x) in Eq. (4.10) and Σ(−iτ, x) in Eq. (4.12) are greatly simplified, and
the second Schwinger-Dyson equation in Eq. (4.5) becomes a second order ordinary differential

Next, we need to determine the constants c0 and s0 . When J = 0, the system is free, so f (z)

c0 = 1. The other constant s0 is determined by the choice of point splitting. As we mentioned in
Sec. 2.2, we have chosen the point splitting in the spatial x direction when regularizing the OPE
of ψi , which leads to the commutation relation (2.4). The commutation relation then requires the

In particular, our assumption in solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation, that |zf (z)| < 1 and f (z)
has no intrinsic singularities or branch points when |z| < 1, is satisfied for 0 ≤ J < 2π. Therefore,
2π is the upper bound of J for the above solution (4.18) to be self-consistent. We will discuss more
on the bound of J at the end of this subsection.
From Eqs. (4.10) and (4.12), we can then obtain the real space two point Green’s function in

Figure 5: The zero temperature spectral weight of the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model in the
large N limit at a given momentum k > 0.
Remarkably, the two point function in the large N limit in Eq. (4.19) has exactly the same
form as that of N = 4 given in Eq. (3.15) at zero temperature, except that the meanings of J are
different: here J is the Gaussian average amplitude of the random couplings Jijkl , while for N = 4
J is defined as the only coupling J1234 . The form of this solution also indicates that the coupling
strength J is exactly marginal, which determines the two velocities u± irrespective of the energy
scale.
Besides, similar to the N = 4 case, the large N solution here also requires a physical bound
of the interaction strength 0 ≤ J < 2π, which ensures the two velocities u± in Eq. (4.19) are
positive. The physical reason for this bound is analogous to that we explained for N = 4 in Fig. 1,
namely, the total chirality of the system would no longer be preserved for J > 2π unless certain UV
nonlinearities are taken into account. More explicitly, this can be seen from the zero temperature
spectral weight obtained by
2Θ(u+ k − ω)Θ(ω − u− k)

(u+ k − ω)(ω − u− k)

where G(ω + i0+ , k) is the momentum space retarded Green’s function obtained by doing an analytical continuation iωτ → ω + i0+ of the imaginary time ordered Green’s function G(iωτ , k). Fig.
5 shows the spectral weight A(ω, k) at a fixed momentum k > 0, which indicates the eigenstate energies of the model at momentum k are distributed within the energy range [u− k, u+ k]. Therefore,
if J > 2π, one would have u− < 0, and part of the eigenstates will have a negative velocity and
reversed chirality. This would lead to a severe change of ground state similar to that illustrated by
Fig. 1(c), which cannot be resolved unless certain UV nonlinearities are considered. Here we shall
only restrict ourselves in the parameter range 0 ≤ J < 2π, so that we do not need to consider any
UV nonlinearities.

4.1.2

Discussion on the real space UV regularization

in Sec. 4.1.1, we derived the zero temperature solution (4.19,4.20) by performing Fourier transforms
of G and Σ from the momentum space to the real space. In particular, we determined the constant
s0 in Eq. (4.17) by considering the x direction point splitting regularization we chose. This
indicates that the real space UV regularization of this model has important physical consequences on
correlation functions, and thus has to be handled correctly. An immediate example is to transform
the real space G and Σ back to the momentum space: since the self energy Σ diverges as 1/r3 in
the real space, its Fourier transform requires a UV regularization, and different UV regularization
18

schemes will give different results as we will see below. In this subsection, we will show that
the correct UV regularization scheme for doing real space integrations in consistency with point
splitting in x direction is to take a UV cutoff of time |τ | ≥ . The readers who are solely interested
in the main results of the paper can skip this subsection and go directly to Sec. 4.1.3.
One may also have noticed that the solution (4.19) factorizes into the product of two conformal
propagators of dimension 14 and velocities u± . Naively, this looks like two decoupled 0 + 1 dimensional SYK systems moving at different velocities u± . However, this cannot be true, since otherwise
they will satisfy the low-energy approximate Schwinger-Dyson equation of the 0 + 1 dimensional
SYK model, rather than the exact 1 + 1 dimensional Schwinger-Dyson equation (4.5) here. In fact,
it is exactly the UV regularization we will discuss below that invalidates such a factorization into
two 0 + 1 dimensional SYK systems.

Let us start by considering the Fourier transformations of the real space G and Σ in Eqs.
(4.19,4.20) back into the momentum space. As we have said, the Fourier transformation of Σ
requires a UV regularization. If the UV regularization is correct, we should be able to find that
the Fourier transformed G and Σ satisfy the first Schwinger-Dyson equation in Eq. (4.5).
We first examine the regularization scheme of taking a UV cutoff |τ | ≥  in the time direction,
where  > 0 is a small number. In this case, the Fourier transformations of both G and Σ are

respectively. Without loss of generality, here we assume k > 0. The integration of x is then along
the contour of the real x axis closing in the lower half plane as shown in Fig. 6. When τ < 0,
the contour integral is zero. When τ > 0, the contour encloses a branch cut between −iu+ τ and
−iu− τ , thus can be deformed into a contour closely surrounding to the branch cut in Fig. 6. This
enables us to rewrite the Fourier transformation as

well convergent in the IR. We have two possible UV divergences, one is from the  cutoff, and the
other is from the end point 0 of the integral. For the latter, we can remind ourselves that the integral
is actually a contour integral, and therefore we should take the principle value (or equivalently by
analytic continuing σ). While for the former, if we neglect the  piece, the two integrals of y+

0 + 1 dimensional SYK Green’s functions or self energies in the conformal limit along y+ and y−
direction. However, as we shall see, the  piece is important to produce an additional contribution
to the self energy Σ, which enables Σ and G to satisfy the 1 + 1 dimensional Schwinger-Dyson
equation exactly.

again in agreement with Eq. (4.7). We see that the UV cutoff  gives rise to a regular piece iωτ + k,
which is important for the answers to exactly satisfy the first Schwinger-Dyson equation in Eq.
(4.5). This shows that UV cutoff |τ | ≥  is the correct regularization scheme, which we will give an
understanding later in this subsection.
We could also try to use a different regularization scheme, for example, take a UV cutoff |x| ≥ 
in the spatial direction. Following a similar calculation, one will arrive at an expression analogous
to Eq. (4.24), except that the region of integration is bounded by u− y+ + u+ y− ≥  and y± ≥ 0.
20

This does not affect the two point function G and the (k+ k− )1/2 piece of the self energy Σ, but
does change the UV contributed bare piece. More explicitly, it is easy to check that the resulting

which obviously do not satisfy the Schwinger-Dyson equation (4.5). In fact, if we instead set
s0 = −1 in the solution (4.17), which corresponds to a time τ direction point splitting, one will
find that the spatial UV cutoff |x| ≥  becomes the correct UV regularization.
The above discussion shows that the real space UV regularization scheme depends on the choice
of point splitting direction, and incorrect UV regularization will lead to answers inconsistent with
the Schwinger-Dyson equation. Here we give a physical understanding why UV cutoff |τ | ≥  is
the correct regularization scheme for point splitting in the x direction. A heuristic understanding
is the following: taking the cutoff |τ | ≥  for the self energy Σ(−iτ, x) is equivalent to setting
Σ(0, x) = 0 on the constant time slice τ = 0. Recall that point splitting in the x direction leads
to the commutation relation (2.4), and requires the two point function G(−iτ, x) to reduce to the
i
on the constant time slice τ = 0 (which is how
free two point function G(0, x) = Gf (0, x) = 2πx
s0 = 1 in Eq. (4.17) is determined). This free nature of G(0, x) therefore intuitively agrees with
the vanishing of the self energy Σ(0, x) = 0 on the time slice τ = 0.

Figure 7: Illustration of how point splitting in the x direction leads to a UV cutoff (x/x )2 +
(τ /τ )2 ≥ 1 with τ /x → 0 for the self energy Σ, which is equivalent to the UV cutoff |τ | ≥  due
to scaling symmetry.
A more intuitive explanation is illustrated by Fig. 7. In real space, the self energy Σ(−iτ, x) ∼
J 2 h(ψj ψk ψl )(0, 0)(ψj ψk ψl )(τ, x)i is the correlation of the operator product ψj ψk ψl , the definition
of which needs a point splitting regularization. For point splitting along the x direction we have
chosen, the three Majorana fields in ψj ψk ψl should be splitted by a spatial spacing x as shown
in Fig. 7(a). Since each ψi is a point-like operator, one could view the regularized ψj ψk ψl as a
“flat-shape” operator with size x in the x direction and τ in the τ direction, where τ /x → 0.
With such a point splitting, the self energy correlation Σ(−iτ, x) is only meaningful when the
two operators (ψj ψk ψl )(0, 0) and (ψj ψk ψl )(τ, x) do not overlap with each other, namely, when
(x/x )2 + (τ /τ )2 ≥ 1. Therefore, when calculating the Fourier transformation of Σ(−iτ, x), one
should take a UV cutoff (x/x )2 + (τ /τ )2 ≥ 1 with τ /x → 0, i.e., perform the Fourier integration
outside the shaded area as shown in Fig. 7(b). This UV cutoff can be further simplified by noting
that the zero temperature solution in Eqs. (4.19) and (4.20) is scaling invariant. Via a scaling
transformation, we can scale x → ∞ while keeping t =  small, which still satisfies t /x → 0.
The UV cutoff is then simplified to |τ | ≥ , i.e., outside the shaded area of Fig. 6(c). Therefore,
this is the correct UV cutoff corresponding to point splitting in the x direction.
21

It is interesting that in our case, even though the magnitude of the UV cutoff  does not affect the final result, the spacetime direction along which we put the cutoff  does have a physical
consequence. This is not very common in high energy theory, since there we usually study interactions preserving the Lorentz symmetry, which guarantees that the direction of UV cutoff does not
matter. In our particular example, the interaction breaks Lorentz invariance, and such a UV cutoff
direction dependence arises.

4.1.3

The finite temperature solution

We now proceed to solve the Schwinger-Dyson equation of our 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model
at finite temperature β −1 , which is given by Eq. (4.5) with iωτ replaced by the Matsubara frequency
iωn = (2n+1)π
(n ∈ Z). Unlike the zero temperature case, the temperature β −1 sets an energy scale
β
for the problem, and the Schwinger-Dyson equation is no longer scaling invariant. Therefore, the
scaling invariant ansatz method in Sec. 4.1.1 no longer applies. Besides, the 1 + 1 dimensional
Schwinger-Dyson equation (4.5) has no reparameterization symmetry, so we cannot do conformal
transformation from zero temperature to finite temperature. This makes the finite temperature
problem much more difficult.
However, there are two hints from the zero temperature solution (4.19,4.20) which help us
guess the finite temperature solution. The first hint is that the large N zero temperature two point
function G has exactly the same form as that of N = 4 (see Eq. (3.15) with β → ∞). The second
hint is that the large N zero temperature G(−iτ, x) and Σ(−iτ, x) factorize into the product of
two zero temperature two point functions and self energies of the 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model
−1
in the conformal limit along τ − iu−1
+ x and τ − iu− x directions, respectively. Although in Sec.
4.1.2 we showed such a factorization is invalidated in the momentum space by an indispensable UV
cutoff regularization contribution, we could expect it is valid in the IR (since the model is scaling
invariant, any finite length scale is IR if no UV cutoff is put in by hand). This motivates us to
guess that the above two facts still hold at finite temperature β −1 , so that the finite temperature
two point function in the large N limit is given by
Gβ (−iτ, x) =

(4.30)

and the finite temperature self energy is Σβ (−iτ, x) = J 2 Gβ (−iτ, x)3 by the second Schwinger
Dyson equation in Eq. (4.5). Namely, we guess the large N finite temperature two point function
Gβ is equal to the N = 4 finite temperature two point function as well, and also factorizes into
the product of two finite temperature 0 + 1 dimensional SYK two point functions in the conformal
−1
limit along τ − iu−1
+ x and τ − iu− x directions. In the remainder of this subsection, we shall verify
that Eq. (4.30) is indeed the large N finite temperature solution.
We shall verify the validity of the two point function Gβ in Eq. (4.30) and the corresponding self
energy Σβ by Fourier transforming them into the momentum space, and check whether they satisfy
the first Schwinger-Dyson equation in Eq. (4.5). For convenience, we set β = 2π in the Fourier
calculations below, while the answers for generic temperature β −1 can be restored by a rescaling
β
(iωn , k) in the end. As we have shown in Sec. 4.1.2, the correct UV regularization for
(iωn , k) → 2π
the Fourier transform is to take a UV cutoff |τ | ≥ . Therefore, we calculate the following general

1 − i as shown in Fig. 8. At a given x, the integrand has three branch points 0, e−u− x , and e−u+ x
on the nonnegative real axis of z. For half-integral σ which we are interested in, z = 0 is not a
branch point. Therefore, we can deform the contour along |z| = 1 into a contour closely bypassing
the nonnegative real axis of z from 1 + i to 0 and then to 1 − i, as shown in Fig. 8. Eq. (4.31)

where the integration over z is from 1 + i to 0 above the real axis, and then from 0 to 1 − i
below the real axis. For convenience, we denote z = e−t , where t = −iτ is the Wick rotation of the
imaginary time τ . The deformed integral contour of z is then equivalent to a contour of t going
from −i to +∞ and then back to +i in straight lines.
For a given z = e−t (and σ being a half integer), the integrand has branch cuts for x along the
2πm
line segments from u− (t+i 2πm
β ) to u+ (t+i β ) (m ∈ Z). Without loss of generality, we assume the
momentum k > 0, so that the integration over x is along a contour of the real x axis and closed in
the lower half plane at infinity. Therefore, the integration of x picks up the contributions of branch
2πm
cuts from u− (t + i 2πm
β ) to u+ (t + i β ) with m ≤ 0 when the imaginary part of t is infinitesimally
negative (i.e., when t is integrated from −i to +∞), and picks up the contributions of branch

cuts from u− (t + i 2πm
β ) to u+ (t + i β ) with m < 0 when the imaginary part of t is infinitesimally
positive (i.e., when t is integrated from +∞ to i). After t is integrated, the contributions of all
m < 0 branch cuts will cancel, and only the contribution of the m = 0 branch cut from u− t to u+ t
remains. Considering these facts, we can deform the x contour into a contour closely surrounding
the branch cut, and write Eq. (4.32) as

function in the large N limit. One can also check that in the limit β → ∞, Eqs. (4.36, 4.37) reduce
to the zero temperature solution (4.26, 4.27) in momentum space.

Thermal quantities and the ground state entropy density

The thermal quantities of the large N chiral SYK model can be derived from the exact finite
temperature solution we obtained in Sec. 4.1.3. In fact, since the large N two point function Gβ
in Eq. (4.30) is of exactly the same form as that of N = 4 in Eq. (3.15), the energy density E and
the energy current jE in the large N limit can be calculated in exactly the same way as we did for
N = 4 in Eqs. (3.17) and (3.18). This gives an energy density

where we have eliminated the unphysical 1/2 terms. This gives a thermal Hall conductance
κxy = ∂jE /∂β = N π/12β if the system is an edge of a 2 + 1 dimensional bulk gapped topological
state. In particular, κxy does not depend on J and is quantized at order O(N ), which agrees with the
general belief that κxy is a topologically invariant quantity. The entropy density S at temperature β
−1
can be calculated from β −1 [∂S/∂(β −1 )] = ∂E/∂(β −1 ), which gives S = S0 + (N π/24β)(u−1
+ + u− ),
where S0 denotes the ground state entropy density. In the below, we discuss the ground state
entropy density S0 of our 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model.
A remarkable feature of the 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model is that it has a large ground state
entropy of order N , which indicates an unusual ground state degeneracy of order eN . This implies
a duality between a 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model on the boundary of a 1 + 1 dimensional AdS
spacetime and a black hole in the bulk, which has a large entropy proportional to the event horizon
area. As a comparison, in the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model here we can examine the ground
state entropy density S0 . However, unlike the 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model where the Hilbert
space dimension 2N/2 is finite, the model here as a field theory has an infinite dimensional Hilbert
space per unit length, which therefore makes the ground state entropy density possibly divergent
and ill-defined. Therefore, we need to impose a physical spatial UV cutoff x to make the Hilbert
space dimension per unit length finite.
The entropy density at temperature β −1 is defined by S = L−1 (1 − β∂β ) log Z, where L → ∞
is the spatial size of the system, and Z is the partition function. By taking the limit β → ∞, we
obtain the ground state entropy density S0 . In the large N limit, we can take a Gaussian average
over the random interactions Jijkl , and write the partition as 2

One can easily check that the Euler-Lagrange equation for Ḡ and Σ̄ is exactly the Schwinger-Dyson

of the functions Ḡ and Σ̄ are simply equal to the two point function G and the self energy Σ we
solved in Sec. 4.1.3. To the leading order of 1/N , the partition function Z is just given by fixing

Instead of calculating the above complicated expression directly, we can compare its value with

Making use of the Schwinger-Dyson equations ∂τ − i∂x − Σ = G−1 (which should be understood
as matrices in the Hilbert space) and Σ(−iτ, x) = J 2 G(−iτ, x)3 , one would find that all the terms

where aj (j ≥ 0) are constants depending on x , τ and J. The coefficient aj is of order O(2j−2

and in particular, a1 (J) does not depend on τ and x . In the free case J = 0, the entropy density
is easily known to be given by Sf = Sf 0 + N π/(12β), where Sf 0 denotes the ground state entropy
density of N flavors of free chiral Majorana fermions. Therefore, we find the entropy density at

It can be directly calculated from Eq. (4.43) that ∂J a1 (J) = 96
(u−2
− − u+ ) . Therefore, the
−1
coefficient of the thermal part of entropy density is N12π + 2a1 (J) = N24π (u−1
+ + u− ), which is in
agreement with our calculations below Eq. (4.39). The ground state entropy density S0 = limβ→∞ S
for any 0 ≤ J < 2π is therefore equal to that in the free fermion case, namely, S0 = Sf 0 . It is
known that N flavors of free chiral Majorana fermions has a unique ground state for periodic
spatial boundary condition, and has 2N degenerate ground states for antiperiodic spatial boundary
condition due to N zero modes. This gives a total ground state entropy either Sf 0 L = 0 or
Sf 0 L = N log 2. Therefore, in the infinite spatial size limit L → ∞, the ground state entropy
density of the free fermions is Sf 0 → 0. We then conclude that the ground state entropy density
for any interaction strength 0 ≤ J < 2π is S0 = Sf 0 = 0. Basically, in order to have S0 different
from Sf 0 , one has to have a constant 1/x piece independent of β in L−1 log Z, which is absent in
Eq. (4.44) here.

The fact that the ground state entropy density S0 = Sf 0 = 0 for any 0 ≤ J < 2π can also be
physically understood from the spectral weight A(ω, k) in the large N limit plotted in Fig. 5. Since
the spectral weight A(ω, k) is nonzero only when u− ≤ ω/k ≤ u+ , this suggests that any many-body
eigenstate |n, ki with momentum k (we use n to denote different states) has an energy bounded
by En,k ∈ [u− k, u+ k], and all the eigenstates have k ≥ 0 (with both the energy and momentum of
the ground state energy defined as zero). This means all the many-body state energy eigenvalues
En,k at momentum k of the chiral SYK system are no smaller than that of N flavors of free chiral
Majorana fermions with velocity u− , and no larger than that of N flavors of free chiral Majorana
fermions with velocity u+ . Accordingly, the partition function Z of the chiral SYK model at any
3
since ∂J a1 (J) is x and τ independent, it can be calculated using UV cutoff |τ | ≥  as illustrated by Fig. 7(b)-(c),
instead of the more complicated cutoff (x/x )2 + (τ /τ )2 ≥ 1 with τ /x → 0.

temperature β −1 will also be bounded by Z+ ≤ Z ≤ Z− , where Z± is the partition function of
N flavors of free chiral Majorana fermions with velocity u± , respectively. Since the ground state
entropy density of free chiral Majorana fermions Sf 0 = 0 is independent of their velocity, the above
bound of partition function Z indicates that the ground state entropy density of the chiral SYK
model has to be S0 = Sf 0 = 0 for any 0 ≤ J < 2π. From this argument, we can see that the chiral
nature of the model (and translational invariance) protects its ground state entropy density to be
at zero.

The OTOC, chaos exponent and butterfly cone

In this section, we derive the chaos exponent and butterfly velocity in the OTOC of the model.
Following [4], we define the regularized OTOC four point function in real time as
F(t1 , x1 ; t2 , x2 ) =

1 X
Tr [yψj (t1 , x1 )yψi (0, 0)yψj (t2 , x2 )yψi (0, 0)] ,

i,j

where y = e−βH/4 = ρ(β)1/4 separates evenly the four fermion fields by a quarter of the thermal
circle. The leading contribution in the early time OTOC comes from the contractions between two
ψi and between two ψj , which gives an order 1 piece −G(−i β2 , 0)G(t1 − t2 − i β2 , x1 − x2 ). The next
order contribution comes from contraction of ψi with ψj , and is of order 1/N at the early time.
Therefore, we can separate the order 1 and order 1/N pieces of the OTOC as

F(t1 , x1 ; t2 , x2 ) = −G(−i , 0)G(t1 − t2 − i , x1 − x2 ) − δF(t1 , x1 ; t2 , x2 ) ,

Figure 9: The ladder diagrams contributing to the 1/N piece δF of the OTOC, which are the
leading order contributions in the 1/N expansion. The solid lines are the two point function, and
the dashed line stands for averaging over Jijkl . This implies δF is approximately an eigenfunction
of kernel KR with eigenvalue 1.
To the leading order of 1/N , the Feynman diagrams contributing to δF are the ladder diagrams
as shown in Fig. 9 [4, 5]. For chaotic systems where there is a Lyapunov regime (which usually
requires unbounded local Hilbert spaces), when t1 = t2 = t, one expects δF to grow exponentially
with respect to time t in the Lyapunov regime. For large N models like ours, the Lyapunov regime
is in the interval β . t . β log N . In this case, at late time t when δF becomes large, it will
approximately satisfy the self-consistent equation

(4.49)

as illustrated by the second line of Fig. 9. Here we have denoted for short tij = ti − tj , and
xij = xi − xj . The functions GR and Glr are the retarded Green’s function and the Wightman
correlator with half thermal circle separation, respectively, which can be explicitly derived via the
analytic continuation of Eq. (4.30) as

Therefore, the function δF is an eigenfunction of kernel KR with eigenvalue 1. To derive the
exponential growth of δF, we first need to compute all the eigenfunctions of kernel KR which have
eigenvalue 1.
To simplify the computation of the eigenfunctions, we make a spacetime coordinate transformation from (t, x) to a new basis

multiplied by a function kR (−ti ) of −ti (1 ≤ i ≤ 4), each of which up to a factor is nothing but
the kernel of a 1d q = 4 SYK model along the t+ or the −t− time direction in the conformal limit.
Therefore, an eigenfunction of the 1 + 1 dimensional kernel KR here can also be factorized into the
product of the eigenfunctions of two 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model along t+ and −t− directions,
respectively. More explicitly, the eigenfunction of the kernel KR can be written into the form

(4.55)

The above eigenfunction (4.54) and eigenvalue (4.55) can be directly verified by substituting them
into Eq. (4.53). Since there is no UV divergence in the above calculations, we do not have the
28

point-splitting issue that arises in the calculation of the self energy Σ. This is consistent with our
expectation that the chaos is controlled by the IR physics.
When the spacetime coordinates of the two ψj fields in Eq. (4.46) coincide, namely, t1 = t2 = t
and x1 = x2 = x, the eigenfunction can be rewritten as

As J grows from 0 to 2π (i.e., J grows from 0 to 1), the maximal Lyapunov exponent λ grows from
0 to the maximal chaos bound 2π/β, as shown in Fig. 10(a).
We now discuss the chaotic behavior and butterfly cone of the function δF(t, x) = δF(t, x; t, x)
with t1 = t2 = t > 0 and x1 = x2 = x set in Eq. (4.46), namely, the 1/N piece of the OTOC of our
chiral SYK model. For this purpose, we need to know the weight coefficient ρ(p) of the eigenfunction
fh+ (p),h− (p) in δF. Due to the translation symmetry, one can check that each total momentum

between magnitude and the chaos exponent derived in [1] to determine the coefficient ρ(p). Up to
multiplication of some mild function, the weight coefficient is dominated by the factor

As discussed in details in [1], the integral at large x and t can be done by using saddle point
approximation for p. The saddle point pv of the integrand of Eq. (4.60) in the complex plane of p
is given by
κ 0 (pv ) + iv = 0,
x = vt ,
(4.61)
which depends on the velocity v = x/t we look at. Since κ(p) is real on the imaginary p axis,
κ 0 (p) is purely imaginary on the imaginary p axis. Besides, κ(p) has two Riemann surface branches
connected by a branch cut. For velocity u− ≤ v ≤ u+ , this yields two saddle points pv and p̃v
on the imaginary axes of the two Riemann surface branches, as shown in Fig. 10(c). The original
29

integration contour along the real axis in Eq. (4.60) can be deformed into two steepest descent
contours passing the two saddle points pv and pev , respectively, as shown in Fig. 10(c). If the
contour deformation does not cross any poles, the integral of Eq. (4.60) will be dominated by the
contribution of the first saddle point pv as (Appendix B)

When the velocity v < vs− or v > vs+ , we have λv < 0, so the saddle point contribution (4.62) no
longer gives an exponential growth in t, and is not valid for large t. In particular, we note that for
any 0 < J < 2π we have vs− > u− and vs+ < u+ (Fig. 10(e)), so vs± are within the causality cone
of the system between u− and u+ (where the retarded Green’s function GR is nonzero).
If the contour deformation for Eq. (4.60) crosses a pole of the integrand, the integral will pick
up both the pole contribution and the saddle point contribution. The weight coefficient ρ(p) has
two poles p1 and p2 satisfying κ(p1 ) = κ(p2 ) = 1 on the positive imaginary axes of the two Riemann
surface branches:

As the velocity v increases to v > v∗ = iκ 0 (p1 ) = 2−2J
2−J , the saddle point pv will move upwards
and pass the pole p1 , and (i.e., v > v∗ ) the integral (4.60) will pick up and be dominated by the
residue of the pole p1 . In particular, one always has vc < v∗ < vs+ for 0 < J < 2π (Fig. 10(f)), so
this transition from saddle to pole contribution at v = v ∗ happens before λv given by the saddle
point contribution decreases to zero. Therefore, for v = x/t > v∗ , the OTOC function has the form

As the velocity v decreases to v < v∗0 = iκ 0 (e

downwards and pass the pole pe1 . Accordingly, the integral (4.60) will be dominated by the residue
of the pole pe1 . Similarly, one has vs− < v∗0 < vc for 0 < J < 2π (Fig. 10(f)), so this transition from
saddle to pole contribution at v = v∗0 also happens before λv decreases to zero. So the OTOC for
v = x/t < v∗0 is given by

and the velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent is λv = 2π(vu−1
− − 1)/β. Therefore, one sees λv
also decreases to zero at velocity v = u− , i.e., the left causality edge. For velocity v < u− , the
growth of δF disappears.
The numerical accuracy of the above saddle point approximation is demonstrated in Appendix
B. Fig. 10(f)-(g) shows the velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent λv as a function of velocity
v = x/t for two cases J = 1.2π and J = 1.9π, respectively. We can therefore define the butterfly
cone of our model as u− < x/t < u+ as shown by the shaded regions in Fig. 10(d), inside (outside)
which λv > 0 (λv < 0). Roughly speaking, the butterfly cone characterizes the range of spreading
of local chiral operators as a function of time [60]. It coincides exactly with the causality cone. We
can summarize the behavior of the OTOC function δF as follows:
1) v− < x/t < v∗0 , in which case the pole pe1 contribution dominates, and δF grows for β .
t . β log N according to Eq. (4.69). This is illustrated by the left dashed shaded region in Fig.
10(d). The velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent in this region is given by λv = 2π(vu−1
− − 1)/β.
Note that the t direction Lyapunov exponent in this region is −2π/β < 0, although the velocity
dependent Lyapunov exponent is positive.
2) v∗0 < x/t < v∗ , where the saddle point pv contribution dominates, and δF grows exponentially
in t as given by Eq. (4.62), which is valid for time β . t . β log N . This butterfly region is
illustrated by the solid shaded region in Fig. 10(d). The velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent
λv reaches its maximal value λ at velocity vc in this range (Eq. (4.63)). Fig. 10(b) illustrates
the OTOC F(t, vc t) along the x = vc t direction, which is proportional to 1 − eλ(t−tsc ) , where
tsc ∼ O(β log N ) is the scrambling time.
3) v∗ < x/t < u+ , where the pole p1 contribution dominates, and the exponential growth of δF
for β . t . β log N is given by Eq. (4.68). This butterfly region is illustrated by the right dashed
shaded region in Fig. 10(d). The velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent in this region is given
by λv = 2π(1 − vu−1
+ )/β. In addition, it is also worthwhile to note that for fixed x > 0 in this
spacetime region, δF grows in t with an exponent 2π/β, saturating the maximal chaos bound.
4) x/t > u+ or x/t < vs− . In this region, δF no longer shows a growing behavior in t. Accordingly, the normalized OTOC F ∼ 1 − N1 δF will tend to 1 at large time t.
As one can see from the constant time t slices of the (normalized) OTOC F(t, x) shown in Fig.
10(h) and (i) for J = 1.2π and J = 1.9π, respectively, the exponential growth is peaked at velocity
vc inside butterfly cone represented by the green shaded area. The peak becomes sharper and tends
to u− as J increases. In some sense, the behavior of the chiral SYK model looks like a nonchiral
chaotic model with its edges of butterfly cone tilted to velocities u± , and its time direction tilted
to velocity vc .

The model at other small finite N

We have seen in Sec. 3 that the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model (2.1) is integrable for N = 4,
and in Sec. 4 that the model is chaotic in the large N limit. Therefore, we conjecture there exists a
critical number of Majorana flavors Nc , below which (N < Nc ) the model is integrable, while equal
to or above which (N ≥ Nc ) the model is non-integrable and chaotic. We note that here this is a
well-defined statement, since the Hilbert space dimension of the 1 + 1 dimensional model (2.1) is
infinite for any N , and the energy spectrum cannot be exactly solved (i.e., integrable) unless the
model has infinite number of conserved quantities defined in terms of local operators. In contrast,
the 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model with N Majorana fermions has a finite Hilbert space at any finite
N , therefore it can always be exactly solved by diagonalizing a finite dimensional Hamiltonian
matrix. In this sense, the 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model is “integrable” at any finite N , and there
is no clear boundary between integrable and non-integrable during the increase of N .
In this section, we show that the 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model is also integrable by
bosonization for N = 5 and N = 6. However, the interactions of the model becomes increasingly
complicated for N ≥ 7. This leads us to conjecture that the boundary between integrable and
chaotic is Nc = 7.
The difficulty in solving the chiral SYK model (2.1) for a finite N > 4 comes from the fact
that there are large number of interaction terms Jijkl ψi ψj ψk ψl which do not mutually commute.
However, we can always rotate the chiral Majorana basis ψi to a new basis ψi0 = Oij ψj , where O
is an SO(N) matrix, under which Jijkl transforms as a rank-4 tensor. In some cases, one can find
a proper basis to reduce the number of interaction terms. This is the basic idea how we can solve
the model for N = 5 and N = 6.

5.1

Exact solution for N = 5

For the chiral model with N = 5, there are 5 independent interactions Jijkl , which forms a total
antisymmetric rank-4 tensor. We can redefine them using their Hodge dual as Ii = 4!1 ijklm Jjklm
(repeated indices are summed), where ijklm is the Levi-Civita symbol. Ii is nothing but a rewriting
of the 5 interactions Jijkl . The Lagrangian density of the model then becomes

simply reduces to the N = 4 model (with interaction strength

is integrable, which is equivalent to two free bosons with velocities u± and a free chiral Majorana

Exact solution for N = 6

Now we turn to the N = 6 case. Following a similar idea, we can redefine the interaction rank-4
tensor Jijkl using its Hodge dual Iij = 4!1 ijklmn Jklmn , which is antisymmetric in i and j. Under
an SO(6) rotation ψi0 = Oij ψj , the interactions Iij transform as an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor.
Therefore, there exists an SO(6) transformation Oij which brings Iij into the standard 2 × 2 block

We can then bosonize the chiral Majorana fermions as ψ10 + iψ20 = eiφ1 , ψ30 + iψ40 = eiφ2 and

Note that we have only quadratic terms of φi in the above Lagrangian. The velocity matrix can
then be diagonalized into Vij0 = diag(u1 , u2 , u3 ) by an SO(3) transformation φ0i = Qij φj , where Qij

N ≥ 7 and thermalization of chiral Majorana fermions

The interaction terms Jijkl of the chiral SYK model become increasingly complicated when N ≥ 7.
For instance, for N = 7, the rank-4 total antisymmetric tensor Jijkl has 35 parameters in total.
One can try to make some of them zero by an SO(7) rotation ψi0 = Oij ψj . However, since the
SO(7) group has only 21 generators, the SO(7) rotation matrix Oij can at most reduce 21 or less
of the interaction parameters Jijkl to zero, while there are still 14 or more nonzero parameters Jijkl
remaining. After bosonization, these remaining 14 or more interaction terms cannot all be bilinears
of boson fields φi of the form ∂x φi ∂x φj but necessarily contain many nonlinear terms of the form
cos(φi ± φj ± φk ± φl ). Therefore, the model is no longer free bosons for N = 7, which makes the
model extremely complicated. This is also the case for all N > 7. Therefore, we conjecture the
model is no longer integrable for N ≥ Nc and starts to show chaotic behaviors in some aspects,
where the critical number Nc ≥ 7, and is probably equal to 7.

j<N-1

Figure 11: A configuration that different flavors of chiral Majorana fermions have different initial
temperatures, and may or may not thermalize with each other later.
One of the physical differences between N < Nc and N ≥ Nc will be the thermalization of the
model, which is closely related to integrability. For instance, consider the spatial configuration of
a set of chiral Majorana edge states as shown in Fig. 11, where the N -th mode ψN is initially
spatially separated from the other N − 1 modes ψj≤N −1 , and merges with them after propagating
a distance. Such a configuration can be realized by using the edges of N copies of the p + ip
chiral topological superconductor. Assume ψj≤N −1 and ψN are connected with thermal baths of
temperature T1 and T2 , respectively. For N < Nc , the model is integrable, so one expects the N
35

chiral Majorana fermion modes do not thermalize with each other during propagation. Instead,
the model with N ≥ Nc is non-integrable, and will have all the chiral Majorana fermion modes
thermalize among themselves after they merge together.
The thermalization of the chiral edge states of a topological condensed matter system may affect
the experimental measurement of its thermal Hall conductance. For instance, the recent experiment
observed a thermal Hall conductance of the filling ν = 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state disagreeing
with theoretical predictions [48, 61–63], and one of the possible explanations is suggested to be the
lack of thermal equilibrium among the chiral edge modes [49–51]. Our model here might be too
idealized to describe a realistic edge of condensed matter system, which always have spatial disorders
and coupling to phonons, etc. However, our results still suggest that thermalization is more difficult
for fewer number of chiral edge modes.

6

In closing

We have introduced a new chiral model in 1 + 1 dimensions which is solvable in the large N limit
like its 0 + 1 dimensional namesake and tensor models. Indeed, the exact scaling symmetry of our
1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model makes it exactly solvable at all energy scales, thus makes it a
“simpler” chaotic model than the the 0 + 1 dimensional SYK model which is only exactly solvable
at low energies. We have calculated the two point function of the model, and verified that the
thermal Hall conductance of the chiral model at nonzero interaction strength J > 0 in the large N
limit is quantized at κxy = N π/12β, which is generically believed to be a topological invariant. We
also find the ground state entropy at nonzero interaction strength J is no different from that of N
free chiral Majorana fermions, which leads to a vanishing ground state entropy density.
The OTOC in the large N limit generically has a Lyapunov regime and an asymmetric butterfly
cone. The velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent λv along x = vt has its maximum reaching the
chaos bound 2π/β when the interaction strength J approaches the upper bound 2π. Therefore, the
model can approach the maximally chaotic limit without having a nonzero ground state entropy
density, which is not expected from a black hole picture. Besides, for any interaction strength J > 0,
the t direction Lyapunov exponent λ for a fixed x near the right butterfly edge always saturates the
chaos bound 2π/β, while near the left butterfly edge the t direction Lyapunov exponent λ is always
−2π/β (although the velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent is positive). This feature near the
left butterfly edge is different from that in nonchiral models. Furthermore, the model is integrable
for small N ≤ 6 as can be seen by bosonization, but becomes increasingly complicated for N ≥ 7.
Therefore, we conjecture there is a transition from integrablity to chaos as N increases to some
number Nc , and the transition is probably at Nc = 7.
Somewhat surprisingly we find that the two point function of the chiral SYK model in the large
N limit is exactly the same as that for N = 4, although the four point functions of the two cases
are completely different. We conjecture such a coincidence of two-point functions is because of the
presence of the SO(N ) symmetry in both the large N case (effectively) and the N = 4 case.
It will also be interesting to investigate whether this model has Schwarzian like soft modes
and an effective Schwarzian action as in [17]. If so, we could ask whether there is a holographic
interpretation. Besides, in this paper we only calculate the OTOC in the late time chaos regime.
To get more information about the operators in the model, one can study the OPE expansion of
the four point function. Furthermore, we have been restricting ourselves to interaction strengths
36

within the range 0 ≤ J < 2π in this paper. One may ask what happens for large N if J > 2π, with
proper UV nonlinearities included to preserve the total chirality (as shown in Fig. 1(c)). In this
case, the model is no longer a purely chiral model. We shall leave these questions to future studies.
We briefly discuss how spatial disorder may affect the model, which always exists in practical
condensed matter systems. The most relevant disordered term one can add to the Hamiltonian
(2.5) is a quadratic fermion term
∆H1 (x) = 2i

N

where Aij (x) is an x dependent real antisymmetric matrix.
However, such a term can be eliminated
Rx

A(x0 )dx0
by a spatially dependent SO(N) rotation ψi → (e
)ij ψj . In addition, the 4-fermion
coupling Jijkl may also has an x dependence due to disorder or the above spatially dependent
SO(N) rotation. However, as long as the couplings Jijkl still have long range spatial correlations,
namely, hJijkl (x)Jijkl (x0 )i → 3!J 2 /N 3 as |x − x0 | → ∞, we expect the physics in this paper remains
unchanged in the IR.
Lastly, we comment that interacting chiral models with a large number of degrees of freedom
(either Majorana fermions or complex fermions) arise naturally in two settings. The first is, naturally enough, that of “infinite layer” quantum Hall systems [64–67] or p + ip chiral superconductors.
The second is the low energy theory of a piece of Fermi surface (of complex fermions with a conserved U(1) charge) in spatial dimension ds ≥ 2 with forward scatterings [68, 69]. In this case, the
fermion dispersion ω = vF k⊥ is linear in the momentum k⊥ normal to the Fermi surface, where
vF is the Fermi velocity. Therefore, one can treat the fermion at each fixed transverse momentum
kk tangent to the Fermi surface as a chiral fermion in the k⊥ direction, and regard kk as a flavor
index which runs over large N number of values. We expect our chiral SYK model to further shed
lights on the general understanding of such chiral systems.

Bosonization and point splitting

(A.1)

where φ is a bosonic field, and :O: stands for the normal ordering of operator O. Since all the point
splitting we are considering is along the x direction, we assume all the fields in the below are on
the same time slice, i.e., at the same t. For simplicity, we shall therefore omit the time variable t
of all fields.
On the constant time slice, the chiral Majorana fermion fields satisfy the anticommutation
relation {c(x), c† (x0 )} = {c(x), c(x0 )} = {c† (x), c† (x0 )} = 0 for x 6= x0 , which requires the boson
commutation relation
[φ(x), φ(x0 )] = iπsgn(x − x0 ) ,
(A.2)
and thus
[∂x φ(x), φ(x0 )] = 2πiδ(x − x0 ) .

(A.3)

To correctly deal with normal ordering, we can separate the boson field φ into
φ(x) = ϕ(x) + ϕ† (x) ,

(A.4)

where ϕ(x) and ϕ† (x) are the collection of annihilation and creation operators in the mode expansion, respectively. The normal ordering rule is then that ϕ† (x) should always be on the left of ϕ(x).
They satisfy [ϕ(x), ϕ(x0 )] = [ϕ† (x), ϕ† (x0 )] = 0. Using Eq. (A.3) and the fact that
2πiδ(x − x0 ) =

Operator product expansion and commutation relation

We can now calculate the operator product expansion of chiral Majorana fermion fields, with a
point splitting in the x direction. First, we consider the bilinear c† (x)c(x0 ) with small x direction

The first constant term 2π(x−xi0 +i0+ ) is the vacuum term. Therefore, by taking the limit x − x0 → 0,
we find the normal ordered density operator is
:iψi (x)ψj (x):=:c† (x)c(x):=

∂x φ(x)

(A.9)

In particular, the density operator is proportional to ∂x φ because the point splitting is in the x

When there are more than 2 chiral Majorana fermion fields ψi , we can define multiple boson
fields, for instance
ψ2i−1 (x) + iψ2i (x)
√
= ci (x) = ηi :eiφi (x) : ,
(A.13)

39

where 1 ≤ i ≤ [N/2], and ηi are the Klein factors satisfying {ηi , ηj } = {ηi† , ηj } = {ηi† , ηj† } = 0 for
i 6= j, and ηi† ηi = ηi ηi† = 1 [59]. Different flavors of boson φi commute with each other. The use of
the Klein factors is only to ensure the anticommutation relation between different fermion fields,
and can usually be neglected in calculations where only bosonic terms are involved.
We can now derive the commutation relation (2.4) of fermion bilinears, [(ψi ψj )(x), (ψk ψl )(x0 )].
First, the commutation is trivially zero when i = j or k = l. Secondly, when i, j, k, l are all
distinct, the
√ commutation is also obviously zero. Thirdly, when i = k 6= j = l, we can define
(ψi + iψj )/ 2 =:eiφ :, and use Eqs. (A.3) and (A.9) to find

We can then summarize these cases into the commutation relation (2.4). Note that since all iψi ψj
(1 ≤ i < j ≤ N ) form the generators of SO(N ) group, so Eq. (2.4) is nothing but the SO(N )1
Kac-Moody algebra.
Besides, for each pair of fermion fields ψi and ψj (i 6= j), from Eqs. (A.9) and (A.11) we can
formally rewrite their kinetic term as

We also need to know the commutator [(ψi0 ψj 0 ψk0 ψl0 )(x0 ), (ψi ψj ψk ψl )(x)]. The general expression
is rather complicated, which we shall not derive here. Instead, we note that the coefficient of
the commutator [(ψi0 ψj 0 ψk0 ψl0 )(x0 ), (ψi ψj ψk ψl )(x)] in [H(x0 ), H(x)] is Ji0 j 0 k0 l0 Jijkl . Here we shall
only derive the energy current T x0 averaged over Jijkl in the large N limit, so one expects this
commutator has a nonzero contribution only if its coefficient Ji0 j 0 k0 l0 Jijkl does not average to zero,
namely, only if (i0 j 0 k 0 l0 ) = (ijkl) up to permutations. The commutator in this case can be easily
derived to be

Saddle Point Approximation for the OTOC

In this section, we give more details on the saddle point approximation for the OTOC integral
(4.60) in the large N limit. In particular, the contour deformation requires a careful consideration
of both branches of the Riemann surface of the function κ(p) defined in Eq. (4.57).
The function κ(p) in Eq. (4.57) has two branch points in the upper half complex plane at

where J = J/2π ∈ [0, 1) as we have defined previously. As a result, κ(p) lives on a Riemann
surface with two branches. To be specific, we define a branch cut along the straight line segment
between the two branch points pb1 and pb2 as shown by the wavy line in Fig. 12(a), which separate
the two branches of Riemann surface. We then denote the branch where the original contour of
the OTOC integral (4.60) lies in as branch 1√(Fig. 12(a)), and the other branch as branch 2. More
specifically, on branch 1 we have κ(0) =
we have κ(0) =

at large p. Since we are interested in velocities v within the causality cone v ∈ [u− , u+ ], the original
integral contour of Eq. (4.60) along the real axis should always be closed in the upper half complex
plane of branch 1 (counterclockwise), as shown in Fig. 12(a) and (e).

satisfying κ(e

so do the two poles p2 and pe1 . For interaction strenth 0 < J < π, poles p2 and pe1 are located in
branch 1 above and below the branch cut, respectively, while poles p1 and pe2 are located in branch
2 above and below the branch cut, respectively. Such an example at J = 0.6π is given in Fig. 10(a),
where we use solid dots for poles lying in branch 1, and hollow dots for poles lying in branch 2.
For interaction strength π < J < 2π, all the poles p1 , p2 , pe1 and pe2 are located in branch 1. Fig.

The first (second) saddle point pv (e
pv ) moves upwards (downwards) on the imaginary axis as v
increases from v− to v+ . When the velocity u− < v < 1, both of the two saddle points pv and pev
are located in branch 1 (Fig. 12(b)&(c)). While when the velocity 1 < v < u+ , the both saddle
points pv and pev will move to branch 2 (Fig. 12(d)).
The saddle point approximation generically works in the following way: if the original integration contour can be deformed into some deepest decent (stationary phase) contour passing a saddle
point of the integrand without crossing any poles, the integral can be evaluated by the value of the
integrand at the saddle point. If the deformed contour contains multiple deepest decent contours
passing several saddle points, the contributions of these saddle points will add, and usually one of
the saddle points will dominate the integral. If the contour deformation crosses some pole of the
integrand, the integral will be contributed by both the saddle point values and the pole residues.
We first discuss the contour deformation when the velocity u− < v < 1, in which case both
saddle points pv and pev are in Riemann branch 1. As shown in Fig. 12(b), the steepest decent
contour of saddle point pv hits the other saddle point pev , forming an ellipse surrounding the branch
cut in branch 1; then from pev the steepest decent contour extends along the imaginary axis to
+i∞ of branch 1 and −i∞ of branch 2 (across the branch cut). In the figure, we use solid lines
to represent contours lying in branch 1, and dashed lines for contours lying in branch 2. Hitting
the other saddle point pev makes the deepest decent contour of saddle point pv ambiguous, which is

so that pv and pev slightly deviates from the imaginary axis. After such a procedure, the steepest
decent contours passing pv and pev no longer coincide, which are illustrated by Fig. 12(c): the
contour passing pv extends from −i∞ of branch 2 to the counterclockwise ellipse surrounding the
branch cut in branch 1, and then extends to +i∞ of branch 1. While the contour passing pev goes
directly from i∞ of branch 1 to −i∞ of branch 2. One can easily check that the original contour in
Fig. 12(a) can be continuously deformed into the sum of the two steepest decent contours passing
pv and pev . Therefore, both saddle points pv and pev contributes to the integral. If −ie
pv < −ip2 or
−ie
pv < −ie
p2 , the deformation will cross the pole p2 or pe2 ; while if −ipv > −ip1 or −ipv < −ie
p1 , the
contour deformation will cross the pole p1 or pe1 . In these cases, the residues of the poles crossed
during the deformation will then also contribute.
Second, we discuss the case when the velocity 1 < v < u+ , where both saddle points pv and
pev move to Riemann branch 2. Fig. 12(d) shows such an example, we we use hollow dots for pv
and pev to remind the reader that they are in branch 2. Now the steepest decent contour passing pv
extends from −i∞ of branch 2 to a clockwise ellipse surrounding the branch cut in branch 2, and
then extends to i∞ of branch 1 across the branch cut. The other contour passing pev still extends
from i∞ of branch 1 to −i∞ of branch 2. In this case, one may find that deforming the original
contour of Fig. 12(a) into the sum of the two steepest decent contours passing pv and pev requires
crossing the two branch points, and may wonder whether this is legal. In fact, it is indeed legal
to cross the branch points in this configuration. This is because here the Riemann surface with
two branches connected by a branch cut is topologically equivalent to a two dimensional sphere, so
the branch points are topologically nonsingular and allow a contour to cross through. By drawing
the Riemann surface as a sphere, one can show the original contour in Fig. 12(a) can be smoothly
deformed into the sum of the two steepest contours of pv and pev in Fig. 12(d). Therefore, the
integral is still contributed by the two saddle points pv and pev , and residues of any of the poles p1 ,
p2 , pe1 and pe2 crossed during the contour deformation.
All together, in the entire velocity range u− < v < u+ , to calculate the integral (4.60) we only
need to add the contributions from saddle points pv and pev , and the residues of poles p1 , p2 , pe1 and
pe2 if crossed during the contour deformation. The evaluation at large t can be further simplified
by noting the following two facts. First, for velocity u− < v < u+ , the residues of the two poles p2
and pe2 give velocity dependent Lyapunov exponents

respectively. Therefore, the residues of poles p2 and pe2 never give an exponential growth in t along
velocity v, and can always be ignored. Secondly, we can compare the exponent in t contributed
by the two saddle points pv and pev . Since pv and pev are symmetric about the branch cut, we can
iJ

denote them as pv = 1−J

Accordingly, the exponents they contribute at velocity v are given by

pv , namely, the exponent contributed by saddle point pv is always larger. Therefore,
we conclude that the first saddle point pv always dominates over the second saddle point pev .

Figure 13: The velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent from saddle point approximation (solid line)
and from direct numerical integration of Eq. (4.60) (dotted line) for J = 1.2π.
Given the above two facts, we find that we only need to consider the contributions of the saddle
point pv and the two poles p1 and pe1 . When −ie
p1 < −ipv < −ip1 , the contour deformation does
not pass either pole p1 or pole pe1 , so the integral is given by the saddle point pv contribution (Eq.
(4.62)). This is the case in the examples of Fig. 12 (c) and (e), where the former (latter) has
0 < J < π (π < J < 2π) and thus pole p1 located in branch 2 (branch 1). When −ipv > −ip1 ,
the OTOC integral is contributed by both the saddle point pv and the residue of pole p1 , and the
exponent contributed by pole p1 is always larger in this case. Therefore, the integral is dominated
by pole p1 (Eq. (4.68)). An example of this case is shown in Fig. 12(d). Lastly, when −ipv < −ie
p1 ,
the OTOC integral is contributed by both the saddle point pv and the residue of pole pe1 , and is
always dominated by pole pe1 .
Fig. 13 shows a comparison between the velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent from saddle
point approximation and that from the direct numerical integration of Eq. (4.60) for J = 1.2π.
This example demonstrates the accuracy of the above saddle point approximation. 4
