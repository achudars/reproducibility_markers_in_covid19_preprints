Employing novel random and supervised scanning methods, we systematicly revisit the
construction of three-family N = 1 supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in Type IIA orientifolds on T6 /(Z2 × Z2 ) with intersecting D6-branes. Arising from the stacks of D6-branes
with U (n) gauge symmetries, the Pati-Salam gauge symmetries SU (4)C × SU (2)L × SU (2)R
can be broken down to the Standard Model via D-brane splitting as well as D- and F-flatness
preserving Higgs mechanism. Also, the hidden sector contains U Sp(n) branes, which are parallel with the orientifold planes or their Z2 images. We find that the Type II T-duality in the
previous study is not an equivalent relation in Pati-Salam model building if the model is not
invariant under SU (2)L and SU (2)R exchange, and provides a way to obtain new models.
We systematically construct the new models with three families, which usually do not have
gauge coupling unification at the string scale. We for the first time construct the Pati-Salam
models with at least one wrapping number whose absolute value is larger than or equal to
5. In particular, for one large wrapping number equal to 5, we find that one kind of models
carries more refined gauge couplings, and thus with more possibilities to have approximate
gauge coupling unification.

INTRODUCTION

The goal of string phenomenology is to construct the N = 1 supersymmetric Standard Models
(SM) or the SM from string theories. In Type I, Type IIA and Type IIB string theories, Dbranes as boundaries of open strings plays an important role in phenomenologically interesting
model building [1]. For the open string sectors, conformal field theory provides the consistent
constructions of four-dimensional supersymmetric N = 1 chiral models with non-Abelian gauge
symmetry on Type II orientifolds. Within such framework, we obtain the chiral fermions on
the worldvolume of the D-branes which are located at orbifold singularities [2–8], and/or at the
intersections of D-branes in the internal space [9], which have a T-dual description in terms of
magnetized D-branes [10, 11].
Within the intersecting D6-brane models on Type IIA orientifolds [12–14], many nonsupersymmetric three-family Standard-like models and grand unified models have been constructed
[12−25]. However, they typically suffer from the large Planck scale corrections at the loop level, or
in other words, there exists the gauge hierarchy problem. On the other hand, a large number of the
supersymmetric three-family Standard-like models and grand unified models have been constructed
as well [26–45], which can solve the above problem. For a review, see Ref. [46].
In Ref. [37], Cvetič, Liu and one of us (TL) systematically constructed the three-family N = 1
supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from Type IIA orientifolds on T6 /(Z2 × Z2 ) with intersecting
D6-branes where all the gauge symmetries come from U (n) branes. The Pati-Salam gauge symmetries SU (4)C × SU (2)L × SU (2)R can be broken down to SU (3)C × SU (2)L × U (1)B−L × U (1)I3R
via D6-brane splittings, and further down to the SM via four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetry
preserving Higgs mechanism. Thus, it provides a road to the SM without any additional anomalyfree U (1)’s around the electroweak scale. Also, the hidden sector contain U Sp(n) branes, which are
parallel with the orientifold planes or their Z2 images. These models have at least two confining
gauge groups in hidden sector, whose gaugino condensation can in turn trigger supersymmetry
breaking and (some) moduli stabilization. In particuar, Chen, Mayes, Nanopoulos and one of us
(TL) found one of these models with a realistic phenomenology [42, 44], and study its variations
as well [43]. Thus, we shall revisit such kind of three-family N = 1 supersymmetric Pati-Salam
model building in this work.
Moreover, it has been pointed out that there are a few other potentially interesting constructions
which might lead to the SM [37]. For example, the possible massless vector-like Higgs fields, which
do not arise from a N = 2 subsector, can break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to the SM
or break the U (1)B−L × U (1)I3R down to U (1)Y . However, because the large wrapping numbers
is required by the increased absolute values of the intersection numbers between U (4)C stack of
D-branes and U (2)R stack or its orientifold image, it might be very difficult to find such models.
Another interesting scenario is to construct the SU (2)L and/or SU (2)R gauge symmetries from
filler branes, i.e., SU (2)L,R = U Sp(2)L,R . And then the number of the SM Higgs doublet pairs

3
might be decreased. However, we do not want to construct the SU (2)L,R gauge symmetries from
the splittings of higher rank U Sp(N ) (N ≥ 4) branes, which would lead to even number of families
in general. In such case, the absolute value for one wrapping number of U (4) branes larger than
2 cannot be avoided, which might make the model building very difficult due to the tadpole
cancellation conditions. Interestingly, with the better scanning method, one can definitely try to
construct these models in the future.
Employing novel random and supervised scanning methods, we will further systematically study
the three-family N = 1 supersymmetric Pati-Salam model building in Type IIA orientifolds on
T6 /(Z2 × Z2 ) with intersecting D6-branes in which the SU (4)C × SU (2)L × SU (2)R gauge symmetries arise from U (n) branes. In particular, we construct the new models with large winding
numbers as well, and find that the approximate gauge coupling unification can be achieved at the
string scale.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we briefly review the basic rules for supersymmetric intersecting D6-brane model building on Type IIA T 6 /(Z2 × Z2 ) orientifolds, the tadpole cancellation conditions, and the conditions for D6-brane configurations which preserve fourdimensional N = 1 supersymmetry. Also, we will briefly review the T-duality symmetries and its
variations in the supersymmetric model building with intersecting D6-branes.
In Section III, we study the supersymmetric D6-brane model building with large winding numbers and generic T-duality in consideration. We point out that the Type II T-duality in Ref [37] is
not an equivalent relation in Pati-Salam model building if the model is not invariant under SU (2)L
and SU (2)R exchange, and provides a way to obtain the new model. With this construction,
we obtain the supersymmetric D6-brane models with only one U Sp group in the hidden sector,
which have three families of the SM fermions, as well as satisfy the tadpole cancellation conditions
and N = 1 supersymmetry preserving conditions. Furthermore, we for the first time expand our
investigation to the models with large wrapping number, a la 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, and obtain the
approximate gauge coupling unification in these models.
In Section IV, we discuss the phenomenological consequences of new models in different classes.
For each class, we show the full phenomenology table for one representative. As explicit examples,
we present the chiral spectra in the open string sector for each class of models. The difference of
T-dual model with paralleled third two-torus in spectrum can also be found in this section.
In Section V, we perform machine learning methods to show in Figure 1 and Figure 2 how
the Minimal Supersymmetric SM (MSSM)-like models expand in our scanning according to the
reduced latent dimension (which reduced from 18 wrapping numbers). We find that the MSSM-like
models tend to gather in islands and indicates more chances to find more MSSM-like models in
the nearby region of them.
In Section VI, we briefly discuss the other potentially interesting setups and conclude. Also,
we present the D6-brane configurations and intersection numbers for supersymmetric Pati-Salam
models in the Appendix.

T 6 /(Z2 × Z2 ) ORIENTIFOLDS WITH INTERSECTING D6-BRANES

First, let us briefly review the basic rules to construct the supersymmetric models on Type IIA
T 6 /(Z

2

× Z2 ) orientifolds with D6-branes intersecting at generic angles, as well as to obtain the

massless open string state spectra in Refs. [27, 29]. In Type IIA string theory which is compactified
on a T 6 /(Z2 × Z2 ) orientifold, we consider T 6 as a six-torus factorized as three two-tori T 6 =
T 2 × T 2 × T 2 . The corresponding complex coordinates for the i-th two-torus are zi , i = 1, 2, 3,
respectively.
The θ and ω generators for the orbifold group Z2 × Z2 , which are respectively associated with
the twist vectors (1/2, −1/2, 0) and (0, 1/2, −1/2), act on the complex coordinates zi as below
θ : (z1 , z2 , z3 ) → (−z1 , −z2 , z3 ) ,
ω : (z1 , z2 , z3 ) → (z1 , −z2 , −z3 ) .

(1)

We implement the orientifold projection by gauging the ΩR symmetry, where Ω is world-sheet
parity, and R acts on the complex coordinates as follows
R : (z1 , z2 , z3 ) → (z 1 , z 2 , z 3 ) .

(2)

Therefore, we have four kinds of orientifold 6-planes (O6-planes) respectively for the actions of ΩR,
ΩRθ, ΩRω, and ΩRθω. In order to cancel the RR charges of O6-planes, we introduce stacks of Na
D6-branes wrapping on the factorized three-cycles. Also, there are two kinds of complex structures
for a two-torus: rectangular and tilted [13, 27, 29, 44], which are consistent with orientifold projection. The homology classes of the three cycles wrapped by the D6-brane stacks can be expressed
in terms of nia [ai ] + mia [bi ] and nia [a0i ] + mia [bi ] for the rectangular and tilted tori respectively, where
[a0i ] = [ai ] + 12 [bi ]. Thus, a generic one cycle can be labelled as (nia , lai ) in both cases, where in terms
of the wrapping numbers lai ≡ mia and lai ≡ 2m̃ia = 2mia + nia for a rectangular two-torus and a
tilted two-torus, respectively. And then lai − nia must be even for a tilted two-torus.
Moreover, for a of Na D6-branes along the cycle (nia , lai ), we need to introduce their ΩR images
a0 -stack of Na D6-branes with wrapping numbers (nia , −lai ). The homology three-cycles for a of Na
D6-branes and its orientifold image a0 respectively are

(3)

i=1

where βi = 0 or βi = 1 for the rectangular or tilted i-th two-torus, respectively. The homology
three-cycles, which are wrapped by the four O6-planes, are given by
ΩR : [ΠΩR ] = 23 [a1 ] × [a2 ] × [a3 ] ,

(4)

ΩRω : [ΠΩRω ] = −23−β2 −β3 [a1 ] × [b2 ] × [b3 ] ,

(6)

ΩRθ : [ΠΩR ] = −23−β1 −β2 [b1 ] × [b2 ] × [a3 ] .

(7)

Thus, the intersection numbers can be expressed in terms of wrapping numbers as follows

(11)

where k = β1 + β2 + β3 is the total number of tilted two-tori, and [ΠO6 ] = [ΠΩR ] + [ΠΩRω ] +
[ΠΩRθω ] + [ΠΩRθ ] is the sum of four O6-plane homology three-cycles.
The generic massless particle spectrum for intersecting D6-branes at general angles, which is
valid for both rectangular and tilted two-tori, can be expressed via the intersection numbers as listed
in Table I. In addition, the two main constraints on the four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric
model building from Type IIA orientifolds with intersecting D6-branes are: RR tadpole cancellation
conditions and N = 1 supersymmetry preservation in four dimensions, which are given in the
following subsections A and B, respectively.

A.

The RR Tadpole Cancellation Conditions

The tadpole cancellation conditions directly lead to the SU (Na )3 cubic non-Abelian anomaly
cancellation [15, 16, 27], while the cancellation of U (1) mixed gauge and gravitational anomaly
or [SU (Na )]2 U (1) gauge anomaly can be achieved by Green-Schwarz mechanism mediated by
untwisted RR fields [15, 16, 27]. The D6-branes and orientifold O6-planes, which are the sources of
RR fields, are restricted by the Gauss law in a compact space, namely, the sum of the RR charges
of D6-branes and O6-planes must be zero due to the conservations of the RR field flux lines. The
conditions for RR tadpole cancellations are given by

The chiral supermultiplets contain both scalars and fermions in such supersymmetric constructions. And in
our convention, the positive intersection numbers give us the left-handed chiral supermultiplets.

For simplicity, we define the following products of wrapping numbers

Ãa ≡ −la1 la2 la3 , B̃a ≡ la1 n2a n3a , C̃a ≡ n1a la2 n3a , D̃a ≡ n1a n2a la3 .

(13)

To cancel the RR tadpoles, we introduce an arbitrary number of D6-branes wrapping cycles
along the orientifold planes, dubbed as “filler branes”, which contribute to the RR tadpole cacellation conditions while trivially satisfy the four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetry conditions. The
tadpole conditions then take the form of

where 2N (i) is the number of filler branes wrapping along the i-th O6-plane that is given in Table
II. The filler branes, which give us the U Sp group, carry the same wrapping numbers as one of the
O6-planes as shown in Table II. When the filler branes have non-zero A, B, C or D, we refer to
the U Sp group as the A-, B-, C- or D-type U Sp group, respectively.

B.

Conditions for Four-Dimensional N = 1 Supersymmetric D6-Brane

In four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric models, 1/4 supercharges from ten-dimensional
Type I T-dual are required to be preserved, namely, these 1/4 supercharges survive the orientation
projection of the intersecting D6-branes and the Z2 × Z2 orbifold projection on the background
manifold. It was shown that the four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetry can be preserved after
the orientation projection iff the rotation angle of any D6-brane with respect to the orientifold

plane is an element of SU (3) [9], or in other words, θ1 + θ2 + θ3 = 0 mod 2π, where θi is the angle
between the D6-brane and orientifold-plane in the i-th two-torus. Because the Z2 × Z2 orbifold
projection will automatically be survived for such D6-brane configuration, the four-dimensional
N = 1 supersymmetry conditions can be written as below [29]
xA Ãa + xB B̃a + xC C̃a + xD D̃a = 0,

Aa /xA + Ba /xB + Ca /xC + Da /xD < 0,

(15)

where xA = λ, xB = λ2β2 +β3 /χ2 χ3 , xC = λ2β1 +β3 /χ1 χ3 , xD = λ2β1 +β2 /χ1 χ2 , where χi =
Ri2 /Ri1 are the complex structure moduli for the the i-th two-torus. And we introduce the positive
parameter λ to put all the variables A, B, C, D on an equal footing. Based on these conditions,
we can classify all the possible D6-brane configurations, which preserve four-dimensional N = 1
supersymmetry, into three types:
(1) The filler brane which has the same wrapping numbers as one of the O6-planes in Table II.
The gauge symmetry is U Sp group. Because one and only one of the wrapping number products
A, B, C and D has non-zero and negative value, we refer to the corresponding U Sp group as the
A-, B-, C- or D-type U Sp group as mentioned in the last section.
(2) The Z-type D6-brane with one zero wrapping number. There are two negative and two zero
values in A, B, C and D.
(3) The NZ-type D6-brane without zero wrapping number. Among A, B, C and D, three of
them are negative while one of them is positive. Based on which one is positive, we can classify the
NZ-type branes into the A-, B-, C- and D-type NZ branes. Each type has two forms of wrapping

8
numbers defined as follows
A1 : (−, −) × (+, +) × (+, +), A2 : (−, +) × (−, +) × (−, +);

(16)

B1 : (+, −) × (+, +) × (+, +), B2 : (+, +) × (−, +) × (−, +);

(17)

C1 : (+, +) × (+, −) × (+, +), C2 : (−, +) × (+, +) × (−, +);

(18)

D1 : (+, +) × (+, +) × (+, −), D2 : (−, +) × (−, +) × (+, +).

(19)

To be convenient , we shall refer the Z-type and NZ-type D6-branes to be U -branes in the following
since they carry U (n) gauge symmetry.

C.

T-Duality Symmetry and its Variations

In string theory, two theories are equivalent when T-duality can be performed to map one
to the other. This also applies to D-brane model building when two models are related by Tduality. For D6-brane configurations, two models are equivalent if their three two-tori as well
as their corresponding wrapping numbers for all the D6-branes are correlated by an element of
the permutation group S3 acting on three two-tori. In addition, two D6-brane configurations are
equivalent if their wrapping numbers on two arbitrary two-tori have the same absolute values but
opposite sign, while their wrapping numbers on the third two-torus are the same. In this case, we
call it as the D6-brane Sign Equivalent Principle. As T-duality is not the key discussion point in
our work, we refer to Ref. [37] for the details about how T-dualities and its variants perform in
intersecting D6-brane model building technically.

III.

SUPERSYMMETRIC PATI-SALAM MODEL BUILDING
A.

Construction of Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models

To construct the SM or SM-like models from the intersecting D6-brane scenarios. besides
the U (3)C and U (2)L gauge symmetries from stacks of branes, we must have at least two extra
U (1) gauge groups in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models to obtain the correct
quantum number for right-handed charged leptons [16, 27–29]. One is the lepton number symmetry
U (1)L , while the other is similar to the third component of right-handed weak isospin U (1)I3R . And
then the hypercharge is given by
QY = QI3R +

QB − QL
,
2

(20)

where U (1)B is the overall U (1) of U (3)C . In general, the U (1) gauge symmetry, which comes
from a non-Abelian SU (N ) gauge symmetry, is anomaly free and then its gauge field is massless.
In our model building, U (1)B−L and U (1)I3R arise from SU (4)C and SU (2)R gauge symmetries,
respectively. Thus, they are anomaly free and their gauge fields is massless.

9
If U (1)I3R arises from the stack of D6-branes on top of orientifold [27, 28], i.e., from the U Sp
group, there exist at least 8 pairs of SM Higgs doublets, and two extra anomaly free U (1) gauge
symmetries in general. These U (1) gauge symmetries could in principle be spontaneously broken via
the Higgs mechanism by the scalar components of the chiral superfields whose quantum numbers are
the same as the right-handed neutrinos. However, the D-flatness conditions cannot be preserved,
and then supersymmetry is broken. Thus, the scale of symmetry breaking should be around the
electroweak scale. Moreover, we typically do not have any other candidates, which can preserve the
D-flatness and F-flatness conditions, and break these gauge symmetries at an intermediate scale.
Therefore, similar to Ref. [37], we concentrate on the Pati-Salam models in which U (1)I3R arises
from the U (2)R symmetry. Because it is very difficult to find the interesting models with SU (2)L
from the D6-branes on the top of O6-plane [37], we study the supersymmetric SU (4)C × SU (2)L ×
SU (2)R model building from three stacks of D6-branes, which are not on the top of orientifold
planes. In our model, we can break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to SU (3)C × SU (2)L ×
U (1)B−L × U (1)I3R via D6-brane splittings, and further down to the SM gauge symmetry via Higgs
mechanism with Higgs particles from a N = 2 subsector [37]. Because we do not have any extra
anomaly free U(1) gauge symmetry around the electroweak scale, we solve a generic problem in
previous constructions [27, 28].
In short, we introduce three stacks of D6-branes, a, b, c with D6-brane numbers 8, 4, and 4,
which respectively give us the gauge symmetryies U (4)C , U (2)L and U (2)R . The gauge anomalies
from three U (1)s are cancelled by the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism, and these U (1)s
gauge fields obtain masses via the linear B ∧ F couplings. Thus, we obtain the Pati-Salam gauge
symmetries SU (4)C × SU (2)L × SU (2)R . Moreover, to have three families of the SM fermions, we
require the intersection numbers to satisfy
Iab + Iab0 = 3 ,

(21)

Iac = − 3 , Iac0 = 0 ,

(22)

where the conditions Iab + Iab0 = 3 and Iac = −3 give us three generations of the SM fermions,
whose quantum numbers under SU (4)C × SU (2)L × SU (2)R gauge symmetries are (4, 2, 1) and
(4̄, 1, 2). To satisfy the Iac0 = 0 condition, the stack a D6-branes must be parallel to the orientifold
(ΩR) image c0 of the c-stack of D6-branes along at least one tow-torus, where in our model building
we choose to be the third two-torus. And then we have Open strings that stretch between the a
2
and c0 stacks of D6-branes. When the minimal distance square Z(ac
0 ) (in 1/Ms units) between

these two stacks on the third two-torus is small, namely when the minimal length squared of
2
2 0
the stretched string is small, we obtain the light scalars with squared-masses Z(ab
0 ) /(4π α ) from

the NS sector, and the light fermions with the same masses from R sector [15, 16, 36], which
(2)

form four-dimensional N = 2 hypermultiplets. Thus, we have Iac0 (the intersection numbers for
a and c0 stacks on the first two two-tori) vector-like pairs of the chiral superfields with quantum

10
numbers (4̄, 1, 2) and (4, 1, 2). These vector-like particles are the Higgs fields, which can break
the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to the SM gauge symmetry, while keep the four-dimensional
2
N = 1 supersymmetry. Especially, they are massless when Z(ac
0 ) = 0. Due to the symmetry

transformation c ↔ c0 , the model with intersection numbers Iac = 0 and Iac0 = −3 are equivalent
to that with Iac = −3 and Iac0 = 0, so we shall not discuss it here.
To break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry to the SM, we split the a-stack of D6-branes into a1
and a2 stacks respectively with 6 and 2 D6-branes. And then the U (4)C gauge symmetry is broken
down to U (3)C × U (1). The gauge fields and three chiral multiplets in adjoint representation of
SU (4)C are broken down to the gauge fields and three chiral multiplets in adjoint representations
of SU (3)C and as well as the gauge field and three singlets of U (1)B−L accordingly. Also, we
assume that the numbers of symmetric and anti-symmetric representations for SU (4)C are na
and na , respectively, similar convention for SU (3)C , SU (2)L , and SU (2)R . These chiral multiplets
for SU (4)C are broken down to the na
representations for SU (3)C , and na

and na chiral multiplets in symmetric and anti-symmetric
chiral multiplets with U (1)B−L charge ±2. Moreover, there

exist Ia1 a02 new fields with quantum number (3, −1) under SU (3)C × U (1)B−L arising from the
open strings at the intersections of a1 and a02 stacks of D6-branes, while the rest of the particle
spectrum remains the same. Also, the anomaly free gauge symmetries from a1 and a2 stacks of
D6-branes are SU (3)C × U (1)B−L , the SU (4)C subgroup.
To break U (2)R gauge symmetry, we split the c-stack of D6-branes into c1 and c2 stacks, and
each one has two D6-branes. And then the gauge fields and three chiral multiplets in adjoint
representation of SU (2)R are broken down to the gauge field and three singlets of U (1)I3R , respectively. The nc
the

nc

chiral multiplets in symmetric representation of SU (2)R are broken down to

chiral multiplets with U (1)I3R charge, while the nc chiral multiplets in anti-symmetric

representation SU (2)R will be gone. Also, there are Ic1 c02 new fields that are neutral under U (1)I3R
arising from the open strings at the intersections of c1 and c02 stacks of D6-brane, while the rest of
the particle spectrum remain the same. The anomaly free gauge symmetry from c1 and c2 stacks
of D6-branes becomes U (1)I3R , the SU (2)R Cartan subgroup.
With the above D6-brane splittings, we obtain the SU (3)C ×SU (2)L ×U (1)B−L ×U (1)I3R gauge
symmetry. In order to break it further down to the SM gauge symmetry, we assume the minimal
(2)

distance square Z(a
to be small, and thus obtain Ia2 c0 pairs of chiral multiplets with quantum

vector-like particles can break the SU (3)C × SU (2)L × U (1)B−L × U (1)I3R gauge symmetry down
to the SM while keep the D- and F-flatness since their quantum numbers are the same as those

For Type IIA orientifolds with intersecting D6-branes, the dynamical supersymmetry breaking has
been studied in Ref. [33]. There exist some filler branes carrying U Sp gauge symmetries that
are confining, and then could allow for gaugino condensation, supersymmetry breaking, as well as
moduli stabilization.
The gauge kinetic function for a generic stack x of D6-branes is given by [33]

In our models, the holomorphic gauge kinetic functions for SU (4)C , SU (2)L and SU (2)R are
identified with stacks a, b, and c, respectively. The holomorphic gauge kinetic function for U (1)Y
is then a linear combination of these for SU (4) and SU (2)R . As shown in [13, 44], we have

Three stacks of D6-branes, which carry U (4)C × U (2)L × U (2)R gauge symmetry, generically determine the complex structure moduli χ1 , χ2 and χ3 because of the four-dimensional N = 1
supersymmetry conditions. Thus, we only have one independent modulus field. In order to stabilize the moduli, one usually has at least two U Sp groups with negative β functions which can be

12
confined and then allow for gaugino condensations [47–49]. In general, the one-loop beta function

If supersymmetry is broken by gaugino condensations, we may need to consider gauge mediation
since gravity mediation is much smaller. Thus, the supersymmetry CP problem may be solved as
well. Unlike Ref. [37] to include alternative supersymmetry broken mechanisms, we will not require
at least two U Sp gauge group factors with negative β functions in our Pati-Salam model building.
From the pheonomenological point of view, we want to emphasize that Type II T-duality in
Ref. [37] is not an equivalent relation in Pati-Salam model building if the model is not invariant
under SU (2)L and SU (2)R exchange. Under the Type II T-duality, the transformations of the
wrapping numbers for any stacks of D6-branes in the model are
nix → −nix , lxi → lxi , njx ↔ lxj , nkx ↔ lxk ,

(32)

where i 6= j 6= k, as well as x runs over all D6-branes in the model. In particular, it is easy to show
that all the intersection numbers will change signs.
For a three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam model, we obtain a corresponding new threefamily supersymmetric Pati-Salam models by exchanging b-stacks and c-stacks of D6-branes
b↔c.

(33)

Especially, the quantum numbers for SU (2)L and SU (2)R in the particle spectrum, as well as
the SU (2)L and SU (2)R gauge couplings at string scale will be interchanged due to the b-stacks
and c-stacks exchange b ↔ c. Therefore, from the phenomenological point of view, this is not an
equivalent relation if the particle content is not invariant under SU (2)L and SU (2)R exchange or
if SU (2)L × SU (2)R gauge couplings are not unified at the string scale. To be more concise, this
is not an equivalent relation if the Pati-Salam model is not invariant under SU (2)L and SU (2)R
exchange.
Moreover, there is a variation of type II T-duality [37]. Under it, the transformations of the
wrapping numbers for any stacks of D6-branes in the model are
lx1 → −lx1 , lx2 → −lx2 , lx3 → −lx3 ,
b ↔ c,

(34)

where x runs over all D6-branes in the model.
This leads to one interesting phenomenon on gauge coupling unification aspect. Looking closer
at the gauge kinetic function relation Eq. (28) and the MSSM gauge coupling relation Eq. (29), it is

13
obvious that when fa /fb = 1, namely when there is the gauge coupling unification for the SU (4)C
and SU (2)L gauge symmetries, after the b- and c-stacks of brane swapped, it will be shifted to the
U (1)Y and SU (4)C gauge coupling unification, i.e., fY /fa = 1. Similarly, when there is a U (1)Y
and SU (4)C gauge coupling unification before the b- and c-stacks of brane swapping, it will be
shifted to SU (4)C and SU (2)L gauge coupling unification at string scale.

B.

Scanning of Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models

We shall search for the new Pati-Salam models with basic properties in the previous subsection.
Similar to Ref. [37], we introduce three stacks of D6-branes, a, b, and c with number of D6-branes
8, 4, and 4, respectively. The corrsponding gauge symmetries are U (4)C , U (2)L and U (2)R . Unlike
the strategy in Ref. [37], we do not restrict ourselves with that at least two U Sp groups in the hidden
sector have negative β functions, and instead we do a broader scanning without any constraint on
the hidden sector.
In general, if all three two-tori are not tilted, we can not obtain the particle spectra with odd
generations of the SM fermions. Thus, we have three kinds of scenarios: one tilted two-torus, two
tilted two-tori, and three tilted two-tori. As pointed out in Ref. [37], the model buildings with two
and three tilted two-tori either do not have three families or violate the RR tadpole cancellation
conditions. And our scanning confirms this observation. Therefore, here we concentrate on the
new scanning with only one tilted torus. We choose the third two-torus to be tilted and study the
new inequivalent Pati-Salam models in the following. In our broader scanning, we obtain several
classes of new models.
The first class of models including Models IX, X, XI, and XII has only one U Sp group, in which
Models IX and X, as well as Models XI and XII are T-dual to each other. Especially, the Models
XI and XII do not have the colored chiral exotic particles. The Higgs particles in Models IX and
XI arise from N = 2 subsectors at the intersections of b- and c-stacks of D6-branes, while the Higgs
particles in Models X and XII arise from N = 2 subsectors at the intersections of b- and c0 -stacks
of D6-branes. There exist four and eight exotic Higgs-like particles in Models IX and X as well as
Models XI and XII, respectively.
The second class of models has two U Sp groups, and the representative models are Models
XIII and XIV, which are T-dual to each other. The Higgs particles in Model XIII arise from
N = 2 subsector at the intersections of b- and c-stacks of D6-branes, while the Higgs particles
in Models XIV arise from N = 2 subsectors at the intersections of b- and c0 -stacks of D6-branes.
Because all these U Sp groups have negative β functions, we may stabilize the modulus and break
the supersymmetry via gaugino condensations.
The third class of models has more than two U Sp groups, and the representative models are
Models XV, XVI, XVII, and XVIII. There exist at least two U Sp groups in these models, which
have negative β functions. So we may stabilize the modulus and break the supersymmetry via

14
gaugino condensations as well. Model XVIII, which have four confining U Sp(N ) gauge groups and
can considered as T-dual of Model I-Z-10 in [37], is the only model in our current scan which has
exact gauge coupling unification at the string scale.
The fourth class of models has the absolute value of at least one wrapping number equal to 5,
and the representative models are Models XX and XXI. This kind of models has not been found
in the previous search [37]. Interestingly, we observe that the MSSM gauge coupling values are
more refined, and there exists the approximate gauge coupling unification. Also, Model XXI has
two U Sp groups with negative β functions. While in Model XX there is only one U Sp group with
negative β function, so we might need to stabilize the modulus with different mechanism.
The fifth class of models has at least one wrapping number whose absolute value is larger than
or equal to 5, and the representative models are Models XXV - XXXIV. We revise our random
scanning methods with supervised scanning and raise the scanning efficiency. A similar cluster
behaviours of three-family models can also be observed in the later discussions in Section V as for
the models with small wrapping numbers. In the next Section we will focus on the phenomenological
studies of the models with small wrapping numbers.

IV.

PRELIMINARY PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDIES

In this section, we shall discuss the phenomenological features of our models. We start with
Models IX and X, which are constructed with one U Sp group. The gauge symmetry is U (4) ×
U (2)L × U (2)R × U Sp(4), while the β function of U Sp(4) group is zero. So we cannot break
supersymmetry via gaugino condensation, and then need the other mechanism for supersymmetry
breaking. Also, how to decouple the exotic particles, which are charged under U Sp(4), is an
interesting question since U Sp(4) is not confined. In Models XI and XII, the gauge symmetry
is U (4) × U (2)L × U (2)R × U Sp(4) as well. The β function of U Sp(4) group is negative, so we
can break supersymmety via gaugino condensation, and decouple the exotic particles. In all these
models, we need to address the modulus stabilization issue as well, which is generic for the models
with one U Sp group.
The Models XIII and XIV are with two confining gauge groups in hidden sector. They are Tdual to each other in the same manner as for the one orientifold plane class of models, and they can
be obtained from Model I-Z-2 in Ref. [37] via generic Type II duality. The full spectrum of Model
XIV is shown in Table V. Because we do not have SU (2)L × SU (2)R gauge coupling unification at
the string scale, the Models XIII and XIV are not equivalent to the Model I-Z-2 in Ref. [37] from
phenomenological point of view. At the string scale, we have SU (4)C × SU (2)R gauge coupling
unification in Models XIII and XIV, while SU (4)C × SU (2)L gauge coupling unification in Model
I-Z-2 of [37]. Recalling the definition of hypercharge gauge coupling, we find that the SU (3)C ×
SU (2)L gauge coupling unification is shifted to SU (3)C × U (1)Y gauge coupling unification, and
vice versa. Similarly, the Model XVII has SU (3)C × SU (2)L gauge coupling unification while its

corresponding model, which is constructed via generic Type II duality, has SU (3)C × U (1)Y gauge
coupling unification. Thus, the generic Type II duality provides a new way to construct the new
models. For Model XV with approximate SU (3)C × U (1)Y gauge coupling unification, we obtain
Model XVI with approximate SU (3)C × SU (2)L gauge coupling unification via generic Type II Tduality. However, we should note that this construction is not simply swapping the b- and c-stack
of D6-branes, but usually the non-trivial Type II T-dualities are performed. For the examples of
performing b- and c-stack of D6-branes swapping under Eq. (34), we show Models XXII, XXIII,
and XXIV respectively from Models XIX, XX, and XXI via Type II duality, in which the SM gauge
couplings are shifted resulting from such D6-brane swapping.
As we mentioned, the U Sp(N ) gauge groups with negative beta functions in hidden sector
have a potential to be confining, and thus the non-perturbative effective superpotential can be
generated via gaugino condensations. The ground state, which is determined by the minimization
of this supergravity potential, can stabilize the dilaton and complex structure toroidal moduli, and
breaks supersymmetry in some cases. For the models with two confining U Sp(N ) gauge groups,
a general analysis of the non-perturbative superpotential with tree-level gauge couplings can be
performed, and it was shown that there can exist extrema with the stabilizations of dilaton and
complex structure moduli [33]. However, these extrema might be saddle points and thus do not
break supersymmetry. Interestingly, if the models have three or four confining U Sp(N ) gauge
groups, the non-perturbative superpotientil allows for the moduli stabilization and supersymmetry
breaking at the stable extremum in general [33].

Among our representative models, two Models (IX and X) carry one U Sp(N ) gauge group with
zero beta function, three Models (XI, XII, and XX) have one confining U Sp(N ) gauge group with
negative beta function, six Models (XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, and XXI) carry two confining
U Sp(N ) gauge groups with negative beta functions, and one Model XVIII have four confining
U Sp(N ) gauge groups and considered as T-dual of Model I-Z-10 in [37]. Therefore, for the latter
seven models, there may exist the stable extrema with moduli stabilization and supersymmetry
breaking due to gaugino condensations, which are very interesting from the phenomenological

points of view. However, as pointed out in Ref. [33], the cosmological constants at these extrema
are likely to be negative and close to the string scale, and thus the gaugino condensations in these
models might not address the cosmological constant problem.
All the models contain the exotic particles that are charged under the hidden gauge groups. The
strong coupling dynamics in hidden sector at certain intermediate scale might provide a mechanism
for all these particles to form bound states or composite particles, which are compatible with
anomaly cancellation conditions. And then similar to the quark condensation in QCD, these
particles would be only charged under the SM gauge symmetry [30]. The U Sp groups have two kinds
of neutral bound states in general. The first one is the pseudo inner product of two fundamental
representations that is generated by decomposing the rank two anti-symmetric representation, and
is general for U Sp groups. In some sense, this is the reminiscent of a meson that is the inner
product of one pair of fundamental and anti-fundamental representations of SU (3)C in QCD. The
second one is the rank 2N anti-symmetric representation of U Sp(2N ) group for N ≥ 2, which is an
U Sp(2N ) singlet and somewhat similar to a baryon, as a rank three anti-symmetric representation
of SU (3)C in QCD. Our models, which contain the second kind of neutral bound states, are Models
XI and XII with confining U Sp(4) group, as well as Models XIII and XIV with confining groups
U Sp(4) × U Sp(4) in the hidden sector. We note that Model XIII and XIV are T-dual to each
other, and are constructed by their b- and c-stack of D6-branes swapped from Model I-Z-2 in [37]
with proper T-duality transformations. For N = 1, these two kinds are the same.
Now we take Models XII and XIV as examples to show explicitly the new composite states.
In Model XII, we present the confined particle spectrum in Table VII. Because it has one confining gauge group U Sp(4) with two charged intersections. Therefore, besides self-confinement, the

18
mixed-confinement between different intersections is also possible, which yields the chiral supermultiplets (1, 2, 2, 1). In Model XIV, the confined particle spectra are given in Table VIII. It has
two confining gauge groups U Sp(4)3 and U Sp(4)4 both with two charged intersections. Besides
the self-confinement, the mixed-confinement between different intersections yields the chiral supermultiplets (4, 2, 1, 1, 1), (4, 2, 1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1, 1), and (4, 1, 2, 1, 1). Note that when there is only
one charged intersection, we do not have mixed-confinement, and only the tensor representations
are yielded from self-confinement. Moreover, it is easy to check from the spectrum that no new
anomaly is introduced to the remaining gauge symmetry, so this model is still anomaly free.

This kind of self-confinement and mixed-confinement between different intersections also applies to the other models except for the Models IX and X. In these two models, we do not have
asymptotical free gauge symmetries in the hidden sector, so the states charged under these symmetries cannot be confined. Because the anomaly cancellations for the confined particle spectra
are not automatically guaranteed, one extra field associated with composite states may be needed
to satisfy t’ Hooft anomaly matching condition. To avoid the unnecessary complications, we only
consider relatively simple examples here.

MACHINE LEARNING AND FUTURE MODEL BUILDING

In this section, we briefly review our scanning methods and employing dimension reduction
methods visually show the hints for future model building. Firstly, we employed the standard
random scanning according to the wrapping numbers up to 5. This is efficient for the scanning
with small wrapping numbers less than 5, while it became very low efficient from wrapping number
5. We improved our scanning methods by setting at least one wrapping number to be large (larger
than 5), and setting the rest scanning to be random. In such a supervised way, we choose for one
torus of one stack of brane (a, b or c-stack of brane) is constructed with larger wrapping number,
while the other torus are constructed with random wrapping (normally with small wrapping but
wrapping number 5 or more also appear) to have a MSSM-like physics model as we discussed in
Section III. Based on the above models, we expect it would be interesting to perform machine
learning methods by feeding the collected data of the above models (e.g. the wrapping numbers
and the intersection numbers) from supervised and random scanning to neural network, etc. In this
way, one can train the neural network to select the MSSM-like physics models from the random
constructed models and generate more MSSM-like physics models.
Now to discuss the possible improvement for future model building, we employ the dimension
reduction methods and visually show the expansion of our constructed models. Firstly, we visually
show how the constructed models with three families of the SM fermions expand with dimension
reduction method “LatentSemanticAnalysis”. With the so-called dimension reduction methods,
we reduce the total 18 wrapping numbers with 18-dimension to 2-dimension and observe that the
selected MSSM-like models expand with pattern according to the first and second latent dimensions
as shown in Figure 1. In which, each point corresponds to a D6-brane model, and the MSSM-like
models with their wrapping number less than 5 are highlighted with green, while the MSSM-like
models with the wrapping number is larger than or equal to 5 are highlighted with red. It is clear
that the MSSM-like models trend to gather on some islands. Recall that the dimensions are reduced
from the wrapping number, we expect once some MSSM-like models are obtained, scanning around
the obtained MSSM-like models will increase the efficiency for future model building.
In an alternative way, with dimension reduction method “AutoEncoder”, we also observe that
according to the wrapping numbers of D6-brane models: each point corresponds to a D6-brane
model, and the MSSM-like models are highlighted with green points when the wrapping number
is less than 5, while the MSSM-like models are highlighted with red points when the wrapping
number is larger than or equal to 5. A similar observation that the MSSM-like models populate
in several separated islands also appear. The fact, where the MSSM-like models gather on islands
in both methods, indicates that there will be more chances to construct new MSSM-like models
there. We note that the dense observation partially contains the contributions from the T-dual
MSSM-like models constructed in the nearby region. With linear algorithm, this behaviors, which
the MSSM-like models tend to gather, can be confirmed as well.

Furthermore, we would like to mention that the heterotic orbifold landscape drawn with deep
autoencoder neural network methods has similar cluster behaviour as shown in [50]. It seems to
us that there might be such cluster behaviors or tend to gather for different model buildings. And
thus, perturb around the current scanning might further enrich the obtained MSSM-like models in
different model buildings.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

We revisited the systematic construction of the three-family N = 1 supersymmetric PatiSalam models from Type IIA orientifolds on T6 /(Z2 × Z2 ) with intersecting D6-branes, where
the SU (4)C × SU (2)L × SU (2)R gauge symmetries arise from the stacks of D6-branes with U (n)
gauge symmetries. We found that the Type II T-duality in Ref. [37] is not an equivalent relation in
Pati-Salam model building if the model is not invariant under SU (2)L and SU (2)R exchange, and
provides a way to obtain the new model. Unlike the previous studies, we did not require at least
two confining U Sp groups. Also, we scanned the wrapping numbers up to 5, and obtained more
interesting models with approximate gauge coupling unification. The Pati-Salam gauge symmetry
can be broken down to the SU (3)C × SU (2)L × U (1)B−L × U (1)I3R via D6-brane splittings, and
further down to the SM gauge symmetry via the D- and F-flatness preserving Higgs mechanism in
which Higgs fields are the massless open string states from a specific N = 2 subsector. Moreover,
Models XIII and XIV are T-dual to each other and can be obtained from Model I-Z-2 in [37] via
generic Type II T-duality transformation. Thus, the SU (3)C × SU (2)L gauge coupling unification
in Model I-Z-2 is shifted to SU (3)C × U (1)Y gauge coupling unification in Models XIII and XIV,
and vice versa. Also, Model XV with b- and c-stack of D6-branes swapped leads to Model XVI
with SU (4) and SU (2)L gauge couplings being closer to unification at the string scale.
Furthermore, we obtained the models with one U Sp(4) group, and the new confine particle
spectrum in Model XII shown in Table VII. The composite particle spectrum of Model XIV, which
is formed due to two confined U Sp(4) groups in hidden sector, is given in Table VIII, where
supersymmetry breaking via a “race-track” scenario is still possible.
Last but not least, we found interesting models with wrapping number larger than or equal to
5 in supervised scanning methods, which was not found before. For these models, especially Model
XXI and its T-duality model, the gauge couplings are in a much more refined form because of the
complicity of the intersections due to a large wrapping number. An approximate gauge coupling
unification is achieved. For the models with larger wrapping numbers, a better gauge unified model
was not found yet for large wrapping number up to 10. However, due to the limited scanning so
far, it is worthwhile to search for the Pati-Salam models with broader scanning and large wrapping
numbers. And in the machine learning and model building part, we observed visually that the
MSSM-like models tend to gather in islands, which indicates more chances to find more MSSM-like
models in their nearby scanning region.

Appendix: Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models
In this Appendix, we tabulate 12 representative models obtained from our broader scanning
method. In the first column for each table, we denote the U (4), U (2)L , and U (2)R stacks of D6branes as a, b, and c stacks, respectively. We also employ 1, 2, 3, and 4 stacks to represent the
filler branes respectively along ΩR, ΩRω, ΩRθω, and ΩRθ orientifold planes, which result in the
U Sp(N ) gauge symmetries. In the second column, N is the number of D6-branes in each stack.
Moreover, we present the wrapping numbers of the various D6-branes in the third column and
specify the third set of wrapping numbers for the tilted two-torus.

24
In the remaining right columns, we give the intersection numbers between various stacks, where
b0

and c0 denote the ΩR images of b and c, respectively. In addition, we present the relation

among the moduli parameters imposed by the four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetry conditions,
and the one-loop β functions (βig ) for the hidden sector gauge symmetries. In particular, we also
give the MSSM gauge couplings in the caption of each model, and thus it is easier to check the
gauge coupling unification. However, we do not require at least two confining hidden gauge sectors
which are needed to realize the moduli stabilization and supersymmetry breaking via gaugino
condensation.
