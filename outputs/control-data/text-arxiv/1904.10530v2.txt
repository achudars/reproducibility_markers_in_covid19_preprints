ABSTRACT
We present archival observations demonstrating that main belt asteroid (6478) Gault
has an extensive history of comet-like activity. Outbursts have taken place during
multiple epochs since 2013 and at distances extending as far as 2.68 au, nearly aphelion.
(6478) Gault is a member of the predominately S-type (i.e., volatile-poor) Phocaea
family; no other main belt object of this type has ever shown more than a single
activity outburst. Furthermore, our data suggest this is the longest duration of activity
caused by a body spinning near the rotational breakup barrier. If activity is indeed
unrelated to volatiles, as appears to be the case, (6478) Gault represents a new class of
object, perpetually active due to rotational spin-up.

1. INTRODUCTION

Active asteroids like (6478) Gault (Figure 1,
this work) are dynamically asteroidal objects
but they uncharacteristically manifest cometary
features such as tails or comae (Hsieh & Jewitt 2006a). With only ∼20 known to date
(see Table 1 of Chandler et al. 2018), active
asteroids remain poorly understood, yet they
promise insight into solar system volatile disposition and, concomitantly, the origin of water
on Earth (Hsieh & Jewitt 2006b).
Active asteroids are often defined as objects
with (1) comae, (2) semimajor axes interior to
Jupiter, and (3) Tisserand parameters with respect to Jupiter TJ > 3; TJ describes an object’s
orbital relationship to Jupiter by

(6478) Gault was halfway between perihelion and
aphelion. This 90 s g-band exposure reached ∼7

where aJ is the semimajor axis of Jupiter, e

Jewitt (2012) for a thorough treatment. Main
belt comets are a subset of active asteroids dynamically constrained to the main asteroid belt
and thought to have volatile-driven activity (see
e.g., Snodgrass et al. 2017 for an in-depth discussion). It is worth pointing out that some
objects have had multiple classifications, for instance (3552) Don Quixote has an asteroid designation due to its low activity and has been
called a near-Earth asteroid (Mommert et al.
2014) but has a TJ of 2.3 which indicates it is
more properly a Jupiter family comet.
Discovering these objects has proven observationally challenging. The first active asteroid, (4015) Wilson-Harrington, was discovered
in 1949 (Harris 1950). In the mid-1980s a connection between bow-shock magnetic field disturbances detected by the Pioneer spacecraft
suggested (2201) Oljato was leaving behind a
distant comet-like gas trail (Kerr 1985), even if
not detected at the object itself (Russell et al.
1984). Despite many efforts (see e.g., Chamberlin et al. 1996) it was not until the 1996
discovery of activity in (7968) Elst-Pizarro that
another active asteroid was visually identified
(Elst et al. 1996). Though initially impact appeared a possible cause (e.g., Toth 2000), when
activity recurred (Hsieh et al. 2010) it was more
indicative of volatile sublimation.
A significant complication hindering our understanding of active asteroids arises when assessing underlying activity mechanisms: causes
are neither few nor mutually exclusive (see Jewitt 2012 for a comprehensive overview). Responsible primary processes include volatile
sublimation (e.g., 133P/Elst-Pizarro, Hsieh
et al. 2010), impact events (e.g., (596) Scheila,
Bodewits et al. 2011; Moreno et al. 2011), rota-

tional breakup (e.g., 311P/PanSTARRS, Jewitt
et al. 2013; Moreno et al. 2014), thermal fracture (e.g., (3200) Phaethon, discussed below),
and cryovolcanism (e.g., (1) Ceres, Küppers
et al. 2014; Witze 2015). Physical interaction,
or “rubbing binary,” has been proposed as a primary mechanism in the case of 311P (Hainaut
et al. 2014, cf. Jewitt et al. 2018). Secondary
mechanisms such as electrostatic gardening,
physical properties like chemical makeup, and
geometric effects (e.g., the opposition effect)
may influence our ability to reliably detect and
quantify outbursts.
One crucial diagnostic indicator of the underlying activity mechanism is whether or not activity recurs. If activity is observed on only
one occasion (i.e., a single apparition), then
the object may have experienced a recent impact event. Expelled material and/or exposed
volatiles sublimating may both cause comae or
tails to appear. Activity would then cease once
ejecta dissipated or the volatile supply is exhausted, reburied, or refrozen.
Recurrent activity is typically associated with
volatile sublimation. For example, Geminid
Meteor Shower parent body (3200) Phaethon
is thought to undergo thermal fracture during
the rapid temperature changes accompanying
its perihelion passages (Li & Jewitt 2013) where
it experiences temperatures > 800 K (Ohtsuka
et al. 2009). Fracture events may directly expel material in addition to exposing volatiles for
sublimation.
Thermally induced activity is thought to increase with decreasing heliocentric distance;
that is, the closer a body is to the Sun, the
more likely an outburst is to occur. Active asteroids are more likely to exhibit activity during perihelion passage (see Table 1 of Chandler et al. 2018). Notable exceptions where
activity was discovered at distances far from
perihelion include 311P/PanSTARRS (Jewitt
et al. 2013) and (493) Griseldis (Tholen et al.

Six Years of Sustained Activity from Active Asteroid (6478) Gault
2015). Activity in “traditional” comets has
been reported at distances that are substantially farther than the main asteroid belt, for
instance Comet C/2010 U3 (Boattini) at 27 au
(Hui et al. 2019). Of the ∼20 active asteroids
known to date, 16 are carbonaceous (i.e., Ctype) but only four are believed to be composed of silicate-rich non-primitive material
(i.e., DeMeo et al. 2009 S-type taxonomy):
(2201) Oljato (Apollo-orbit), 233P/La Sagra
(Encke-orbit), 311P/PanSTARRS (inner main
belt), and 354P/LINEAR (outer main belt).
(6478) Gault activity was first reported in
2019 January (Smith et al. 2019). Ensuing
follow-up observations (Maury et al. 2019) confirmed activity with subsequent reports (Lee
2019; Ye et al. 2019a) providing evidence of
ongoing activity. Ye et al. (2019b) reported
that multiple outbursts actually began in 2018
December. Analysis of dust emanating from
(6478) Gault via Monte Carlo tail brightness
simulations indicate the current apparition,
comprised of two outbursts, could have begun
as early as 2018 November 5 (Moreno et al.
2019). Simultaneous to our own work, Jewitt
et al. (2019) reported three tails with independent onsets, the earliest being 2018 October
28.
We set out to determine if any data in our
local repository of National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) Dark Energry Camera (DECam) images showed signs of activity.
The ∼500 megapixel DECam instrument on the
Blanco 4 m telescope situated on Cerro Tololo,
Chile, probes faintly (∼24 mag) and, as we
demonstrated in Chandler et al. (2018), it is
well-suited to detect active asteroids. We produced novel tools taking into account (1) orbital
properties of (6478) Gault (summarized in Appendix A) and (2) observational properties (e.g.,
apparent magnitude, filter selection, exposure
time) to find ideally suited candidate images.
2. METHODS

3

We searched our own in-house database of
archival astronomical data (e.g., observation
date, coordinates) in order to locate images
that are likely to show (6478) Gault. Our
database includes the entire NOAO DECam
public archive data tables along with corresponding data from myriad sources (e.g., NASA
JPL Horizons Giorgini et al. 1996; see also the
Acknowledgements).
2.1. Locating Candidate Images
We began our search for (6478) Gault by making use of a fast grid query in R.A. and decl.
space. We then passed these results through
a more accurate circular filter prescribed for
the DECam image sensor arrangement. Lastly,
we computed image sensor chip boundaries precisely to ensure that the object fell on a sensor
rather than, for example, gaps between camera
chips. This progressively more precise query approach cut down image search time by orders of
magnitude.
2.2. Observability Assessment
We created a reverse exposure time calculator to estimate how faintly (i.e., the magnitude
limit) candidate images probed. After applying
color coefficient corrections (see Willmer 2018
for procedure details) we transformed the colorcorrected magnitudes to the absolute bolometric system used by the DECam exposure time
calculator1 . These steps enabled us to compute differences between apparent magnitude
and the specific magnitude limit of the DECam
exposure so that we could produce a list of images where (6478) Gault could be detected.
2.3. Thumbnail Extraction
We downloaded the image files containing
(6478) Gault from the NOAO archive and, following the procedures of Chandler et al. (2018),
we extracted flexible image transport system
1

4

Chandler et. al

(FITS) thumbnails of (6478) Gault. We then
performed image processing to enhance contrast before finally producing portable network
graphics (PNG) image files for inspection.
2.4. Image Analysis
We visually inspected our (6478) Gault
thumbnail images to check for signs of activity. PNG thumbnails with activity indicators
were examined in greater detail via the corresponding FITS thumbnail image.
To assess the influence of heliocentric distance
on activity level we employed a simple metric
(see Chandler et al. (2018) “%peri ” for motivation) describing how far from perihelion q the
target T was located (at distance d) relative to
its aphelion distance Q by

3. RESULTS

We successfully extracted thumbnails from 9
archival observations of (6478) Gault; see Table 1 for details. Most data were available in
raw and calibrated form (“InstCal” and “Resampled” are described by Dark Energy Survey Collaboration 2014) allowing us to extract
∼30 thumbnail images in total. Figure 1 shows
(6478) Gault in 2013 with a pronounced tail in
the 6 o’clock direction. Figure 4 (a) and Figure 4 (b) show (6478) Gault in 2016 and 2017,
respectively. Additional images may be found
in Appendix B.
Figure 2 summarizes our observed activity.
We found activity at least once in every set of
observations and no correlation with distance.
We plotted apparent V -band magnitude (solid
green line) and found that all periods of activity
were observed near opposition events. We further define “observability” (dashed yellow line)
as when the object was (1) above 15◦ elevation,
and (2) visible outside of daylight hours. This

allowed us to assess potential observational biases specific to the southern hemisphere where
our data were collected. As demonstrated by
the coinciding of apparent magnitude maxima
with spikes in apparent magnitude, the primary
observability factor was solar elongation.
Figure 3 shows how (6478) Gault varies in
both temperature T and distance r through
time. Indicated are our activity observations
(red stars) and the current apparition (blue pentagon). Temperature varies between ∼165 K at
aphelion Q (blue dash-dotted line) and ∼200K
at perihelion q (orange dotted line).
We define persistent activity as activity detectable across contiguous sets of observations
spanning at least two epochs, even if activity is
not visible in every image (due to, for example,
exposure time and/or filter selection). We also
expect to see activity at all positions throughout
the orbit where (6478) Gault may be detectable
by DECam, given appropriate observing parameters (e.g., exposure time, filter selection).
4. DISCUSSION

Most active asteroids, like comets, are composed of low-albedo (i.e., dark), primitive material allowing for sublimation or release of
volatiles to occur when the body is heated during close passages with the Sun (Hsieh et al.
2018b).
Of the ∼20 known active asteroids, four belong to the S-type asteroid taxonomy defining non-primitive silicate-rich material (DeMeo
et al. 2009). For these four objects, the causes of
activity, when identifiable, are thought to be rotational breakup or impact. Rotational breakup
and impact events are consistent with single apparitions or short-lived activity. Furthermore,
Hsieh et al. (2018a) found that processed material bodies, such as S-types, are more likely to
become active due to disruption, while primitive material bodies, such as C-types, can become active via multiple mechanisms due to
their volatile abundances.

(6478) Gault has been identified as a core
member of the Phocaea Family (Knežević & Milani 2003). The Phocaea family is dominated by
75% S-types, followed by 15% C-types, and 10%
a mix of other asteroid taxonomies (Carvano
et al. 2001). While this work was in review, Jewitt et al. (2019) reported color measurements
suggesting that (6478) Gault is closer in taxonomic class to a C-type body, rather than an
S-type. However, gases were not detected in
their spectra, suggesting that sublimation may
not be the underlying cause.
Sustained activity near perihelion normally
can point to sublimation driven activity, but we
observe activity nearly at aphelion during opposition. We do see variability in activity intensity, but we observe activity in (6478) Gault in
at least one image in each set of observations in
our DECam data set, suggesting that the target
is perpetually active. As a result, we conclude
there is no correlation between distance and activity for (6478) Gault.
Because we observe persistent activity, impactdriven disruption seems unlikely as we would
expect the timescale for the activity to be
relatively short. The most probable cause
for activity has been presented as disruption
due to rotational breakup of (6478) Gault

(Moreno et al. 2019; Ye et al. 2019a,b) due to
the Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack
(YORP) effect spin-up (Kleyna et al. 2019); see
McNeill et al. (2016), Lowry et al. (2007), and
Bottke et al. (2006) for detailed explanations of
YORP forces.
Rotational breakup holds for an S-type composition where we would anticipate landslides or
surface material redistribution caused by rapid
rotation near the 2.2 hr spin rate barrier, which
is consistent with the measured ∼2 hr light
curve period reported by Kleyna et al. (2019).
We predict that (6478) Gault will continue to
show signs of activity as it has for the last 6
years in a relatively steady state. We do not
expect catastrophic disruption of (6478) Gault
(cf. Moreno et al. (2019)).
The activity observed in (6478) Gault over
multiple epochs and throughout its orbit make
(6478) Gault the first known sustained-activity
active asteroid in the main asteroid belt. As a
likely S-type asteroid, this is also the first time
that we have observed a sustained active body
at the rotational barrier for such an extended
duration. If activity is in fact not volatilerelated, then Gault is a new class of object, perpetually active due to spin-up. We encourage
continued monitoring of both the lightcurve and

the refracted solar upper-limb elevation was < 0◦ (i.e., nighttime). Peaks in apparent magnitude coinciding
with peaks in observability indicate opposition events; conversely, secondary magnitude peaks aligned with
observability troughs highlight solar conjunctions, i.e., when (6478) Gault was “behind” the Sun as viewed
from Earth. All activity has been observed near opposition events. Also, activity was seen at every epoch
in our data. The histogram (vertical blue bars) indicate the number of thumbnails that we extracted for a
