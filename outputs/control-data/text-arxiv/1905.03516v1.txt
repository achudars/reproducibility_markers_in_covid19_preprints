ABSTRACT
Observations of Neptune, made in 2018 using the new Narrow Field Adaptive
Optics mode of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument at the
Very Large Telescope (VLT) from 0.48 – 0.93 µm, are analysed here to determine
the latitudinal and vertical distribution of cloud opacity and methane abundance
in Neptune’s observable troposphere (0.1 – ∼ 3 bar). Previous observations at
these wavelengths in 2003 by HST/STIS (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011, Icarus
205, 674–694) found that the mole fraction of methane above the cloud tops (at
∼ 2 bar) varied from ∼ 4% at equatorial latitudes to ∼ 2% at southern polar
latitudes, by comparing the observed reflectivity at wavelengths near 825 nm controlled primarily by either methane absorption or H2 –H2 /H2 –He collision-induced
absorption. We find a similar variation in cloud-top methane abundance in 2018,
which suggests that this depletion of methane towards Neptune’s pole is potentially a long-lived feature, indicative of long-term upwelling at mid-equatorial
latitudes and subsidence near the poles. By analysing these MUSE observations
along the central meridian with a retrieval model, we demonstrate that a broad
boundary between the nominal and depleted methane abundances occurs at between 20 – 40◦ S. We also find a small depletion of methane near the equator,
perhaps indicating subsidence there, and a local enhancement near 60 − 70◦ S,
which we suggest may be associated with South Polar Features (SPFs) seen in
Neptune’s atmosphere at these latitudes. Finally, by the use of both a reflectivity
analysis and a principal component analysis, we demonstrate that this depletion
of methane towards the pole is apparent at all locations on Neptune’s disc, and
not just along its central meridian.

Introduction

The visible and near-infrared spectra of both Uranus and Neptune are formed by the
reflection of sunlight off its cloud layers, modulated mostly by the absorption of gaseous
methane and also Rayleigh scattering at blue wavelengths. At wavelengths of low gaseous
absorption, sunlight can penetrate to, and be reflected from, the deepest cloud layers,
while at wavelengths of high absorption only sunlight reflected from the upper layers
can be observed. Hence, such spectra can be inverted to determine the cloud structure
as a function of location and altitude, but only if we know the vertical and latitudinal
distribution of methane. For many years planetary astronomers assumed that the vertical
profiles of methane determined from Voyager 2 radio-occultation observations could be used
at all locations on these planets. However, HST/STIS observations of Uranus recorded in
2002 (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2009) and similar observations of Neptune recorded in 2003
(Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011) both revealed that the abundance of methane actually
varies significantly with latitude on both planets. HST/STIS observes the 300 – 1000 nm
range, which includes collision-induced absorption (CIA) bands of H2 –H2 and H2 –He near
825 nm. Such spectra allow the cloud structure to be probed at wavelengths of either mostly
CH4 absorption or mostly H2 –H2 /H2 –He collision-induced absorption, allowing variations
of CH4 to be differentiated from cloud-top pressure variations (Fig. 1). Karkoschka and
Tomasko (2009, 2011) found that the methane abundance near the main observable H2 S
cloud tops at 2–3 bar varies from ∼ 4% at equatorial latitudes to ∼ 2% at polar latitudes
for both planets. These observations point to a very different overturning circulation of
air at these pressure levels than that seen in the upper troposphere, where mid-infrared
observations find cooler temperatures near the tropopause at mid-latitudes than at the
equator and poles, indicative of air rising at mid-latitudes in the upper troposphere and
subsiding elsewhere (e.g. Fletcher et al. 2014; de Pater et al. 2014). These observed
latitudinal dependancies of methane also mean that cloud retrievals that do not include

–4–
these variations will likely retrieve erroneously low cloud-top pressures near the poles of
these planets.
Since the HST/STIS observations of Uranus in 2002 (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2009),
latitudinal variation in the abundance of methane above the clouds in Uranus’s atmosphere
has been found in: 1) a reanalysis of HST/STIS 2002 observations (Sromovsky et al.
2011); 2) IRTF/SpeX observations (800 – 850 nm) made in 2009 (Tice et al. 2013); 3)
Gemini/NIFS observations made in 2010 (Irwin et al. 2012) at 1.45 – 1.85 µm, where the
degeneracy between cloud-top pressure and methane was partially broken by the use of high
spectral resolution; 4) HST/STIS observations made in 2012 combined with Keck/NIRC2
observations (2007-2011) (Sromovsky et al.

2014), where methane depletion at high

latitudes was modelled as regions of downwelling air, using “proportionally descended gas”
profiles (found by Sromovsky et al. (2011) to provide a good match to the HST/STIS 2002
observations of Karkoschka and Tomasko (2009)); and 5) further HST/STIS observations
made in 2015, again combined with Keck/NIRC2 observations (Sromovsky et al. 2019),
which again found depleted methane towards Uranus’s north pole, but found that the
absolute methane abundance was dependent on the assumed aerosol properties.
While the abundance of methane in Uranus’s atmosphere has been extensively studied,
the latitudinal variation of methane in Neptune’s atmosphere has not been determined
since HST/STIS observations in 2003 (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011). Hence, it is
of great interest to see if the latitudinal variation of methane observed by HST/STIS
in Neptune’s atmosphere over 15 years ago remains the same today. In this paper we
present new visible/near-infrared ground-based spectral observations of Neptune made
in 2018 with VLT/MUSE and use them to make an initial estimation, for the first time
with ground-based observations, of the spatial distribution of methane above the clouds
in Neptune’s atmosphere. A more exhaustive analysis of clouds and cloud-top methane

–5–
abundance, combining the VLT/MUSE observations with longer wavelength near-infrared
observations from the VLT/SINFONI and Gemini/NIFS will be the topic of a future,
follow-on paper.

VLT/MUSE observations

The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument (Bacon et al. 2010) at
ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile is an integral-field spectrograph, which records
300 × 300 pixel ‘cubes’, where each pixel, or ‘spaxel’, contains a complete visible/nearinfrared spectrum (0.48 – 0.93 µm) with a spectral resolving power of 2000 – 4000. MUSE
has two viewing modes: a Wide-Field Mode (WFM) with a 6000 × 6000 field of view (FOV)
and a Narrow-Field Mode (NFM), with a 7.500 × 7.500 FOV (giving a pixel size of 0.02500 ),
which utilises Adaptive Optics (Arsenault et al. 2012; Ströbele et al. 2012) to improve
the spatial resolution to < 0.100 . At such a spatial resolution it is important to correct for
differential atmospheric refraction between different wavelengths, for which MUSE utilises
an atmospheric dispersion compensator that reduces residual shifts between wavelengths
to less than a pixel. Commissioning observations of Neptune were made in this new NFM
mode on June 19th 2018, which we present and analyse here. The NFM mode needs to
reserve some wavelengths for its laser guide star and thus MUSE/NFM observations do not
include the wavelength range 0.578 – 0.605 µm. Six observations of Neptune were made, two
with exposures of 10s each and four with exposures of 120s, as summarised in Table 1. The
performance of the adaptive optics system is estimated for these observations to achieve
a point-spread-function (PSF) with a full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.0600 at the
wavelengths considered here. No attempt was made to quantify the shape of the PSF from
these observations (which would require the analysis of point object observations, which we
did not have) and hence it is not known how significant a fraction of the total observed flux

–6–
comes from outside the 0.0600 FWHM. Hence, we avoided analysing observations made too
close to the planet’s limb, which could contain an unquantified contribution from space,
and observed no biases at the extremes of the latitude range considered.
In contrast to the MUSE spectral resolution of 2.45Å in NFM, the best available source
of methane absorption in this spectral range are the band-model coefficients of Karkoschka
and Tomasko (2010), to which we have fitted k-distributions using exponential-sum fitting.
These data have a spectral resolution of 25 cm−1 between 19300 and 25000 cm−1 (0.518 0.4 µm), and 10 cm−1 at wavenumbers less than 19300 cm−1 (0.518 µm). These resolutions
equate to roughly 5 Å (i.e. 0.0005 µm) across the visible range and so the MUSE data
cannot be analysed using these coefficients at their native resolution. Hence, the data
were first smoothed to make them more compatible with the available methane data and
also improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. We chose to smooth the MUSE data to the
resolution of the IRTF/SpeX instrument, which has a triangular instrument function with
FWHM = 20 Å (i.e 0.002 µm), sampled at 0.001 µm. We find that this spectral resolution
captures the essential shape of the observed spectra very well and has significantly better
SNR than MUSE’s native resolution, giving SNRs ranging from ∼ 80 at the reflectance
peak to ∼ 40 at methane-absorbing wavelengths.
The MUSE data were reduced with the VLT/MUSE pipeline v2.5.1 (Weilbacher et
al. 2014) and flux-calibrated using the spectrophotometric standard star EG274, observed
on the same night. For this study, spectra were extracted from the MUSE data from 64
individual spectral pixels, or ‘spaxels’, spread along the central meridian of Neptune, but
not too close to the limb to experience significant mixing with space, as shown in Fig. 3.
Twelve spaxels, roughly equally spaced in latitude, were selected for detailed description,
indicated by the white dots in Fig. 3 and listed in Table 2. Cube ‘3’ was chosen for this
analysis as it was representative of all the 120s-integrated observations (‘3’ – ‘6’), and the

–7–
SNR was sufficient that we did not need to co-add multiple cubes. We originally attempted
to fit these data using the noise values provided by the pipeline, but found we could not
fit to this level of precision, achieving χ2 /ny values of ∼ 4 at best. Hence, we doubled
these errors in the fits presented here, where we achieve a minimum χ2 /ny of ∼ 1. We
attribute this inability to fit to within the original noise estimate to ‘forward-modelling’
deficiencies in our model, arising from factors ranging from errors including: 1) errors in our
gaseous absorption data; 2) systematic deficiencies in our model set up; 3) the smoothing
process itself introducing unaccounted-for covariances into the smoothed spectra; and 4)
any residual calibration errors.
To check the flux calibration, Fig. 4 compares the measured disc-averaged reflectance
spectrum for Cube ‘3’ with the disc-averaged albedo spectrum of Karkoschka (1994),
showing the generally good agreement (∼ 10%). Neptune has a highly dynamic atmosphere
and it is not surprising that the disc-averaged albedo spectrum we have measured in 2018
differs slightly from the spectrum of Karkoschka (1994), which was observed in 1993. We
can see in Fig. 3 that the reflectance spectrum changes significantly with both position on
the disc and local cloud conditions, as can be seen when we compare these spectra with
the observed centre-of-disc reflectance spectrum, which is noticeably brighter. Figure 4
also compares the MUSE spectra with recently acquired (September 2018) HST/WFC3
observations near the disc centre (HST/OPAL (e.g. Simon et al. 2015) programme; Simon –
private communication). Here we see reasonably good agreement between the VLT/MUSE
and HST/WFC3 observations, which together with our reasonable correspondence with
the albedo spectrum of Karkoschka (1994) leads us to conclude that the photometric
calibration of our data is reliable and consistent with previous observations.

Radiative-transfer analysis

The vertical cloud structure and methane abundance were retrieved from these
observations using the NEMESIS radiative transfer and retrieval code (Irwin et al. 2008).
NEMESIS models planetary spectra either by using a line-by-line model, or by using the
correlated-k approximation (e.g. Lacis and Oinas 1991). Since our methane absorption
data is from a band model (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2010) we used the method of
correlated-k here, constructing k-tables from the band data using exponential-sum fitting.
As with our previous analyses (e.g. Irwin et al. 2011, 2016), we used the matrix-operator
multiple-scattering model of Plass et al.

(1973) to simulate these reflected sunlight

spectra, modelling the atmosphere with 39 levels spaced between ∼ 10 and ∼ 0.01 bar and
using either 5 or 9 angles (both upward and downward) in a Gauss-Lobatto zenith-angle
quadrature scheme, with the number of required azimuth components in the Fourier
decomposition determined from the maximum of the reflected or incident-solar zenith
angles. The collision-induced absorption of H2 -H2 and H2 -He near 825 nm was modelled
with the coefficients of Borysow et al. (1989a,b, 2000)1 . In retrieval tests we found that
the H2 –H2 /H2 –He CIA coefficients for hydrogen with thermally-equilibriated ortho:para
hydrogen ratio were much more consistent with the observed spectra than the ‘normal’
3:1 ortho:para hydrogen ratio (more appropriate for planets such as Jupiter, where air
is upwelled rapidly from deeper, hotter levels) and so we used these coefficients in our
retrievals. A similar conclusion was reached by Baines and Smith (1990) and Gautier et
al. (1995). Rayleigh scattering was also included, where for each gas the contribution
was calculated as described in the Appendix. At these wavelengths, however, effects of
polarization and Raman scattering were justifiably ignored (e.g. Sromovsky 2005). To

–9–
analyse the measured radiance spectra with our radiative-transfer model we used the solar
spectrum of Chance and Kurucz (2010), which was first smoothed with a triangular
line shape of FWHM = 0.002 µm to make it compatible with our smoothed spectra. To
calculate the reflectivity we also needed Neptune’s distance from the Sun on the date of
observation, which was 29.94 AU.
The reference temperature and abundance profile used in this study is the same as
that used by Irwin et al. (2014) and is based on the ‘N’ profile determined by Voyager-2
radio-occultation measurements (Lindal 1992), with He:H2 = 0.177 (15:85) including 0.3%
mole fraction of N2 . This profile was determined at equatorial latitudes and thus its use as
a ‘global’ a priori is moot. At the level of the main clouds (p ∼ 2 bar) it has for many years
been thought that Neptune’s atmosphere should become barotropic, in which case we would
not expect large latitudinal variations in temperature at these levels. However, Tollefson et
al. (2018) have suggested that a vertical shear seen in the zonal wind speeds inferred from
tracking cloud features in H-band (1.4–1.8 µm) and K-band (1.8–2.2 µm) observations,
may be caused by a significant variation in atmospheric temperatures from equator to
mid-latitudes to poles. Depending on their assumptions for the latitudinal variation of
methane, Tollefson et al. (2018) find that latitudinal variations in temperature of up to 2 –
15 K may be present at pressures greater than 1 bar. We will return to the potential effect
of such temperature variations on our methane retrievals later in this section. Finally, our a
priori methane profile was set to have a deep mole fraction of 4% (Karkoschka and Tomasko
2011), limited to 100% relative humidity in the upper troposphere and constrained from
exceeding a mole fraction of 1.5 × 10−3 (Lellouch et al. 2010) in the stratosphere.
Rather than fit the entire spectrum we focussed only on the 0.77 – 0.933 µm region.
This was done for a number of reasons: 1) the number of wavelengths was reduced from 459
to 161, which increased retrieval speeds; 2) by limiting the wavelength range to the single

– 10 –
reflectance peak containing the H2 –H2 CIA feature we could more reasonably assume single
particle size distributions; and 3) by analysing longer wavelengths only we are much less
sensitive to the effects of Raman scattering, Rayleigh scattering (from air and stratospheric
aerosols), and the effects of polarisation (Sromovsky 2005).
We initially attempted to model the spectrum using a continuous profile of identical
particles, and found good fits to individual spectra with either small (0.1 µm) or larger
(1.0 µm) particles. However, we found this model was not able to match the observed
limb-darkening/limb-brightening seen at different wavelengths very well and so we instead
adopted the parameterised model used by Irwin et al. (2016) to model VLT/SINFONI
and Gemini/NIFS H-band observations of Neptune, which was found to provide good
limb-darkening/limb-brightening behaviour. In this model, particles in the troposphere
are modelled with a cloud with a variable base pressure (set to an a priori pressure of
∼ 3 – 4.5 bar) and a scale height retrieved as a fraction of the pressure scale height, while
scattering from haze particles is modelled with a second layer, with variable base pressure
at ∼ 0.1 bar and fixed fractional scale height of 0.1. The particles in the tropospheric
cloud were modelled here with a standard Gamma size distribution with mean radius 1.0
µm and variance 0.05, while the stratospheric haze particles were modelled with a Gamma
size distribution with mean radius 0.1 µm and the same variance of 0.05. Following Irwin
et al.

(2015), the real refractive index of both particle types was set to 1.4 (broadly

typical refractive index of H2 S and NH3 liquid/ice: Havriliak et al.

1955; Wong and

Anderson 1974; Martonchik and Orton 1994) at a reference wavelength of 0.8 µm
and NEMESIS used to retrieve the imaginary refractive index spectrum. The a priori
imaginary refractive index spectrum was set to 0.01 ± 0.005 and sampled at every 0.05
µm between 0.75 and 0.95 µm, with a ‘correlation length’ of 0.1 µm set in the covariance
matrix to ensure that the retrieved spectrum varied reasonably smoothly with wavelength.
At each iteration of the model, the real part of the particles’ refractive index spectrum

– 11 –
at wavelengths other than the reference wavelength of 0.8 µm was computed using the
Kramers-Kronig relation (e.g. Sheik-Bahae 2005). Self-consistent scattering properties
were then calculated using Mie theory, but the Mie-calculated phase functions were
approximated with combined Henyey-Greenstein functions at each wavelength to smooth
over features peculiar to perfectly spherical scatterers such as the ‘rainbow’ and ‘glory’, as
justified by Irwin et al. (2018) (although such features are not actually present for the
particle sizes we have assumed at these wavelengths in our Mie-modelled phase functions).
We found that this two-cloud-component model was able to adequately represent the
limb-darkening/limb-brightening of Neptune’s atmosphere at different wavelengths and so
would not confuse such effects with the latitudinal changes in our retrieved composition
and cloud estimates, since we observe higher latitudes at higher emission angles.
To set up a baseline model able to account correctly for limb-darkening/limbbrightening we first of all selected observations from Cube ‘3’ in the latitude band 10◦ S
– 5◦ S, plotted these as a function of observing zenith angle and extracted the general
limb-darkening/limb-brightening curves at all wavelengths. At each wavelength, the
observations were fitted with smooth reflectance versus emission angle curves, and sampled
at six emission zenith angles between 12.5 and 65◦ (Fig. 5), corresponding to six of the
zenith angles in our nine-zenith-angle quadrature scheme, and not coming too near the
disc edge to minimise PSF uncertainty errors. In our retrieval we fitted for: the base
pressures and opacities of both cloud/haze layers, the fractional scale height of the cloud,
the imaginary refractive index spectra of both particle types and a scaling factor for the
deep methane abundance. The methane profile was limited to not exceed 100% relative
humidity and to not exceed a mole fraction of 1.5 × 10−3 in the stratosphere. This gave 16
freely variable parameters in all. We should stress here that although in this scheme we
retrieve a ‘deep’ methane mole fraction, what we are actually sensitive to (and what we
actually report) is the abundance of methane just above the main cloud deck, i.e. at 2 – 3

– 12 –
bar, rather than the ‘bulk’ deep abundance. It is not plausible for the deep methane mixing
ratio on Neptune to have a large latitude dependence as this would result in a large gradient
in density if not compensated for by a horizontal thermal gradient. The thermal wind
equation is actually a density wind equation and if molecular weight gradients existed to
great depths then there would also be vertical wind shears extending to great depths, which
if integrated to the cloud tops would lead to a huge latitude dependence in the cloud-top
wind speed, which is not observed. It is thus likely that any retrieved latitudinal variations
in the ‘deep’ methane abundance are restricted to the upper troposphere, as suggested by
Karkoschka and Tomasko (2011) for both Neptune and Uranus in their Fig. 10. The case
for a similar depletion profile on Uranus is made by Sromovsky et al. (2014, 2019), based
both on theoretical grounds and on the improved fit quality obtained for upper tropospheric
depletion rather than deep depletion.
Our fits to the measured spectra at the six sampled zenith angles are shown in Fig.
5 and it can be seen that very good fits were achieved at all zenith angles (χ2 /ny = 1.62)
giving confidence that our model was able to account for limb-darkening/limb-brightening.
Our retrieved cloud/haze structure is shown in Fig. 6, together with our retrieved imaginary
refractive index spectra. Here we see, as was found in the H-band from VLT/SINFONI
observations (Irwin et al.

2016), that the limb-darkening/limb-brightening is best

matched with tropospheric particles with low imaginary refractive index (giving reasonably
high single-scattering albedos of $ ∼ 0.9), while in the stratosphere, the particles are
retrieved to have higher imaginary refractive index, giving lower single-scattering albedos
of $ ∼ 0.74; this higher imaginary refractive index for the haze particles is necessary to
lower the single-scattering albedo sufficiently to match the observed limb-darkening at
methane-absorbing wavelengths, as previously noted for H-band observations by Irwin et al.
(2011) and (Irwin et al. 2016). While our model was able to constrain the pressure level
of the haze reasonably well, it was less able to constrain the base pressure of the cloud. We

– 13 –
thus attempted retrievals with a number of different base pressures and finally settled on
a priori pressure of 4.2 bar, which gave the reasonably good fit (i.e. χ2 /ny = 1.62) to the
observations shown in Fig. 5.
Using the assumption that the same cloud scattering properties can be used at all
latitudes, we then fixed the complex refractive indices of both particle types, fixed the
cloud/haze base pressures and fitted the central meridian spectra with just four parameters:
the opacities of the cloud and haze layers, the fractional scale height of the tropospheric
cloud, and the deep methane mole fraction scaling parameter. In this analysis we used
our 5-zenith-angle quadrature scheme (for reasons of speed) and Fig. 7 shows the fits
we were able to achieve to the observed reflectance spectra with our model at our twelve
representative locations, spread along the central meridian and summarised in Table 2. Here
we can see that we achieve a reasonably good fit to the observed spectra with χ2 /ny ∼ 1–3
at most locations, increasing to larger values between 20 and 40◦ S, where the mid-latitude
cloud belt is seen. Also shown in Fig. 7 are lines joining the observed reflectivities at 827
and 833 nm, extended slightly to enable the gradient to be more clearly seen. These lines
will be explained later.
Figure 8 shows our fitted methane profiles. In most cases we have plotted the retrieved
deep methane abundance and errors directly, but at some locations we retrieved very large
methane abundances and very large errors. In these locations we found that the pressure
level where the retrieved deep methane abundance intersects the saturated methane mole
fraction profile lay at pressures greater than the pressure where the cloud optical depth (i.e.
opacity to space) is unity. Hence at these locations, since the methane profile is constrained
to not exceed 100% relative humidity, the retrieval becomes insensitive to the deep methane
abundance and we can only derive a lower limit on the deep methane abundance, which we
have set here to be the saturated mole fraction at the pressure where the cloud optical depth

– 14 –
is unity. Apart from these few locations we can see that the deep methane abundances are
reasonably well constrained in this analysis and decrease significantly towards the south
pole, with the retrieved latitudinal differences mostly exceeding the retrieval errors. As we
noted earlier, we used a single temperature profile at all latitudes in this analysis. If the
real temperatures were slightly warmer in the ∼ 0.5 – 1.5 bar level, the saturated vapour
pressure would be higher and thus our retrieved methane profiles would be constrained by
different saturated mole fraction profiles. As a result, we would retrieve different deep mole
fractions to achieve the same column amount of methane above the cloud top. To test this
we computed the saturated methane mole fraction profiles using the latitude-dependent
temperature profiles fitted from mid-infrared observations by Fletcher et al. (2014), which
we also show in Fig. 8. Here, we see that since the temperature profiles retrieved by
Fletcher et al. (2014) are generally cooler than our a priori assumptions the saturated
methane mole fractions are even smaller. Hence, to achieve the same column abundance of
methane above the clouds, we would have to either lower the cloud top altitude, or increase
further the deep methane abundance. However, mid-IR observations are not very sensitive
to the temperatures near the 1-bar level and so, even though Fletcher et al. (2014) retrieve
cooler tropopause/upper-troposphere temperatures, we believe that the cooler temperatures
inferred near 1 bar are most likely to be caused more by the vertical smoothing imposed
on the profiles, rather than true lowering of the temperatures here although, as we noted
earlier, Tollefson et al. (2018) find that the temperatures in the 1 – 3 bar region may vary
with latitude by several K, depending on the assumed latitudinal variation of methane. If
this is the case, then this would have an impact on our retrieved deep mole fractions of
methane. Hence, although we detect a clear decrease in methane abundance above the
cloud as we go from the equator to the south pole, the absolute abundances are more
difficult to constrain.
Fig. 9 shows the latitudinal dependence of the retrieved cloud and methane profiles

– 15 –
at all 64 ‘spaxels’ analysed along the central meridian as contour plots, where we have
plotted the results for all sampled latitudes, not just the twelve shown in Figs. 7 and 8.
Fig. 9 also shows the fitted χ2 /ny at all latitudes together with the latitudinal variation
in the retrieved deep abundance of methane. We can see that we achieve good fits to
these data at all locations and that we detect a clear and significant decrease in cloud-top
methane abundance from 4 – 5% at near-equatorial latitudes to 3 – 4% polewards of
∼ 40◦ S. In addition, Fig. 9 also shows the methane latitudinal variation determined from
HST/STIS observations on 2003 by Karkoschka and Tomasko (2011), showing reasonable
correspondence. This indicates that our results are broadly consistent with this earlier
determination.

Reflectivity spectral analysis

To understand how the abundance of methane can be extracted from these data,
Fig. 10 shows our fit to the spectrum near the disc centre assuming 4% deep methane
mole fraction and then spectra recalculated with the methane abundance either halved or
doubled. It can be seen that as we do this, the modelled reflectivity near the centre of the
H2 –H2 /H2 –He CIA bands does not change much, but the reflectivity either side of the 0.820
– 0.835 µm reflectance peak is significantly altered. In essence as we increase the abundance
of CH4 the peak becomes slightly narrower, especially on the long-wave side. We wondered
if it might be possible to elucidate this phenomenon directly from the observations, without
having to run a full and time-consuming retrieval at every location on Neptune’s disc. We
can see in Fig. 10 that at wavelengths 827 and 833 nm there is roughly equal reflectance in
our reference spectrum, indicating that we probe reflectance from roughly the same pressure
level, but with the opacity of the former wavelength dominated by H2 –H2 /H2 –He CIA
absorption and the latter wavelength dominated by CH4 absorption. Hence, as the methane

– 16 –
abundance rises, R827 − R833 increases, and as the methane abundance falls, R827 − R833
decreases. The observed R827 − R833 differences are indicated by the short, straight lines
shown in Fig. 7, where we can see that R827 − R833 is roughly zero near the equator, but
becomes noticeably negative as we approach the south pole, consistent with the lower
retrieved abundance of CH4 found here. Fig. 11 shows mapped images of the observed
reflectivity R827 − R833 difference applied to all six sets of observations. In this scaling we
expect larger reflectivity differences to be associated with enhanced abundances of methane
and we can indeed see larger signals near mid-latitudes, falling towards the south pole.
We can also see a faint enhancement circling the south pole. As can be seen ‘striping’
artefacts are visible in some of these images, due to calibration errors and there was initially
a concern that this might have affected our retrievals. However, it can be seen that the
striping is not too severe in observation ‘3’, chosen for our retrieval analysis, and we could
find no significant impact in our retrievals along the central meridian when crossing from
one ‘stripe’ to the next. Hence, we conclude that while these small calibration errors are
quite noticeable in these radiance-differencing images, which compare two wavelengths, they
do not significantly affect our retrievals that simultaneously fit to multiple wavelengths.
In Fig. 12 we show the averaged reflectivity image at 827 nm, averaged over
observations ‘3’, ‘4’, and ‘6’, compared with the averaged image at 833 nm and then the
averaged difference image. We again see larger R827 − R833 signals near mid latitudes, falling
towards the south pole, and also a slight brightening of the difference at 60−70◦ S, indicating
possible local enhancement of methane at this latitude. Looking at the reflectivity images
(which we have here enhanced to try to bring out the weaker features) we see a slightly
brighter zone at 60 − 70◦ S and then lower reflection polewards of 75◦ S in the 827 nm image,
whereas the methane image at 833 nm is relatively featureless. Hence, we appear to detect
either a slight thickening or vertical extension of the main cloud from 60 − 70◦ S which is
masked in the methane image by an accompanying increase in methane abundance and

– 17 –
thus absorption. We note that an enhancement in methane abundance at 60 − 70◦ S can be
discerned in our retrieved deep CH4 abundances in Fig. 9.

Principal Component Analysis

The weak and rather noisy nature of the CH4 reflectivity difference map (Fig. 11)
led us to explore alternative methods of mapping the spectral relectivity signal of CH4
in Neptune’s atmosphere. We turned to the technique of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) (e.g. Murtagh and Heck 1987), used with great success in modelling visible/near-IR
Jovian spectra by Dyudina et al.

(2001) and Irwin and Dyudina (2002). The basic

principle of Principal Component Analysis is that the variance of a set of observed spectra,
in this case the varying spectra observed over Neptune’s disc, can be decomposed into a
set of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) that form a linear basis from which any
spectrum in the set, y(λ), can be reconstructed from a linear combination of the EOFs,
Ei (λ), as y(λ) = Σi αi Ei (λ), where the coefficients, αi , describe the relative proportions
of the different EOFs in the combined spectrum. The derived EOFs have with them an
eigenvalue, ei , and the EOFs are usually ranked in order of decreasing ei . With this ordering
it is found that most of the variance can be accounted for by the first EOF (i.e. the one
with the largest derived eigenvalue), with decreasingly significant contributions from higher
EOFs. The derived EOFs do not necessarily correspond to anything physically significant,
but under certain circumstances they can sometimes correspond to real variables.
In this case, since we are interested in searching for the spectral signatures of
H2 –H2 /H2 –He and methane absorption, which have similar absorption strengths near 0.83
µm, we analysed the observed Neptune spectra covering the wavelength range 0.80 – 0.86
µm. The results are shown in Fig. 13. As can be seen the eigenvalues of the fitted EOFs
fall rapidly with increasing EOF number and we can also see that the spatial distribution

– 18 –
of the fitted weighting coefficients, αi , become increasingly noisy. In fact, we found that
the first three EOFs effectively encapsulate all the significant information. We can see that
EOF 1 is mostly flat, and that its spatial map corresponds almost exactly with the I/F
appearance of Neptune over these wavelengths. Hence, this EOF appears to encapsulate the
overall observed reflectivity variation. EOF 2 has a similar spectrum (albeit inverted) and
its spatial distribution is almost the inverse of the spatial distribution for EOF 1, although
its spatial structure exhibits finer structure, including a dark ‘halo’ about the south pole
at ∼ 80◦ S. EOF 3 also contains significant spectral variation, but its spatial distribution
is very different from that of EOFs 1 and 2, with significant contribution from Neptune’s
equatorial latitudes, but low contributions towards the south pole. The spectral shape of
EOF 3 looks similar to the expected spectral signature of changing the CH4 scaling factor,
shown earlier in Fig. 10 and reproduced in Fig. 13 for reference. Hence, this EOF seems
to correspond rather well with the retrieved cloud-top methane abundance and we can see
low values polewards of 40◦ S, just as we see in our retrieved methane profies (Fig. 9) and
faintly in our reflectivity difference maps (Figs. 11 and 12). In Fig. 9 we compare our
retrieved methane abundances with the variation of α3 along the central meridian, scaled
to match the overall variations, and find that it broadly matches the retrieved reduction
in cloud-top methane abundance towards the south pole. We can also see from both Figs.
9 and 13 that the contribution from EOF 3 has slightly lower values near the equator,
similar to the very slight reduction in retrieved methane abundance near the equator seen
in Fig. 9. Hence, applying the PCA technique in this spectral range seems to recover one
component that roughly matches the retrieved latitudinal variation of methane cloud-top
abundance and which adds credibility to our conclusion that methane at Neptune’s cloud
tops is diminished at latitudes polewards of 40◦ S at all longitudes and not just along the
central meridian as we have formally retrieved.

Conclusion

We have made an initial estimation of the latitudinal variation of cloud-top methane
abundance in Neptune’s atmosphere, for the first time from ground-based observations,
using the new Narrow Field Mode of the MUSE instrument at VLT. We find that methane
varies with latitude broadly similarly to the variation seen in HST/STIS observations in
2003 (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011). Hence, this distribution with latitude would appear
to be a long-lived feature (or is at least slowly-varying) and our retrieved abundances
appear to be consistent with this earlier determination, with a retrieved mole fraction of
4 − 5% at equatorial latitudes, reducing to 3 − 4% at polar latitudes. Our maps of CH4
abundance variations show considerable fine detail, which could be useful for constraining
the detailed structure of Neptune’s atmospheric dynamics. The lower values of cloud-top
CH4 over Neptune’s south pole is consistent both with the HST/STIS determinations of
Karkoschka and Tomasko (2011) and also with a multi-wavelength analysis of de Pater
et al. (2014), which concludes that the increased brightness of Neptune’s south pole at
radio wavelengths is caused by a lower humidity of hydrogen sulphide (H2 S). This low
humidity may be part of a wider overturning circulation in Neptune’s atmosphere, which
has air rising at mid-latitudes (detected by cooler tropopause temperatures observed in
the mid-IR, (e.g. Fletcher et al.

2014)) and leads to subsiding motion of ‘dry’ air at

polar latitudes, extending all the way from the stratosphere down to the cloud tops. In
our observations, this upwelling branch is coincident with the cloudy regions seen at 20
– 40◦ , but what happens at equatorial latitudes is less clear. However, a slightly lower
methane abundance apparent at the equator in our retrieved parameters (Fig. 9) and also
our EOF 3 contribution map (Fig.13), might indicate local downwelling at the equator
also, which may explain why the main cloud here is retrieved to have lower opacity and is
less vertically extended. Since we retrieve similar cloud-top pressures at all latitudes, but
very different methane abundances, we surmise that this cloud is not composed of methane

– 20 –
ice, but is most likely composed of hydrogen sulphide ice, as is probably also the case in
Uranus’s atmosphere (Irwin et al. 2018, 2019). Interestingly, de Pater et al. (2014) note
that South Polar Features (SPFs) seen in Neptune’s atmosphere at 60 − 70◦ , are convective
storms, produced by baroclinic instabilities at the edge of the south polar prograde jet.
The fact that we detect very slightly enhanced methane at these latitudes appears to
support this conclusion. Further analysis, combining these VLT/MUSE observations with
existing longer-wavelength observations from instruments such as VLT/SINFONI and
Gemini/MUSE, is planned to more tightly constrain the cloud properties (using a wider
wavelength range) and also explore alternative methods of parameterising the methane
vertical profile such as the “proportionally descended gas” profiles, found by Sromovsky
et al. (2011) to provide a good match to the HST/STIS 2002 observations of Uranus.
However, this extended analysis is beyond the scope of this ‘initial-results’ paper, reporting
the new MUSE/NFM Neptune observations.

Appendix - Calculation of Rayleigh-scattering optical depth

The Rayleigh-scattering cross-section of Neptune’s air (i.e. cm2 ) in our radiative
transfer model is calculated as (e.g. Allen 1976):

8π 3
σ(λ) = 4 2
3λ N

P

i

xi (ni (λ)2 − 1)2 δi
P
i xi

where the summation is over each gas present, with mole fraction xi , refractive index
spectrum ni (λ) (at standard temperature and pressure) and depolarization factor δi . N is
the total number density of air molecules (i.e. cm−3 ). The depolarisation factor for each
gas is calculated as:
δi =

6 + 3∆i
6 − 7∆i

where the factors ∆i are listed in Table 3. Similarly, the refractive index of each
gaseous component (at STP) is taken to vary with wavelength as
ni (λ) = 1 + Ai (1 + Bi /λ2 )

The approach of summing over mole fraction like this was suggested by Larry
Sromovsky [private communication], who also shared the parameters used. The coefficients
Ai and Bi are also listed in Table 3. Here, the refractive index parameters are taken from
Allen (1976), although for CH4 , which is not listed, they have been set to be the same as
NH3 . The depolarization coefficients, ∆i are from Penndorf (1957), after Parthasarathy
(1951); CO2 values have been assumed for CH4 and NH3 .

been processed to remove discrete features (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011). At wavelengths
of low H2 –H2 and H2 –He absorption (i.e. right) we see that the polar latitudes appear
to be brighter than equatorial ones. If methane abundance were assumed to be constant
with latitude, the brighter appearance of polar latitudes in the methane-image could be
interpreted as being due to higher clouds there. However, the more uniform brightness seen
in the H2 –H2 /H2 –He-absorbing image (left) shows that the appearance of Neptune in the
methane-absorbing images is actually due to lower methane abundance at polar latitudes.

Notes: variables marked with an asterisk were all fixed to values found through our limb-darkening
analysis; p1 is the pressure (bar) where the cloud opacity to space is unity; fCH4 is the retrieved
cloud-top CH4 mole fraction (%), i.e. the mole fraction at pressure p1 ; pC is the base pressure
(bar) of the lower cloud; τC is the opacity of the cloud (at 0.8 µm); FSHC is the fractional scale
height of the cloud; pH is the base pressure (bar) of the haze; τH is the opacity of the haze (at
0.8 µm); FSHH is the fractional scale height of the haze; χ2 /ny is the chi-squared statistic of the
fit. Where the methane mole fraction at the cloud-top pressure p1 is already limited to not exceed
the saturated vapour mole fraction, we instead quote a lower limit for the methane abundance just
below the cloud. The assumed refractive index spectra (deduced from the limb-darkening analysis)
of the cloud and haze particles are shown in Fig. 6

Fig. 2.— VLT/MUSE observation ‘3’ analysed in this study averaged over all wavelengths
(i.e. white) and also over three different photometric spectral channels: a) Johnson V (507
– 595 nm); b) Cousins R (578 – 716 nm); and c) Cousins I (712 – 861 nm). In these plots,
Neptune’s south pole is at bottom left. It can be seen that deeper cloud structure becomes
increasingly clear at longer wavelengths, where we are less sensitive to Rayleigh scattering
from overlying gas molecules.

Fig. 3.— VLT/MUSE observation ‘3’ averaged over the Cousins I photometric channel (712
– 861 nm), plotted as apparent size and angle on the sky, and showing the position of
the sampled ‘spaxels’ along the central meridian (black squares). The spaxels selected for
detailed description in subsequent plots and tables are indicated by the white squares. Also
plotted is a reference latitude-longitude grid, with lines of latitude (planetocentric) separated
by 20◦ and lines of longitude separated by 45◦ . The equator is indicated by the dashed line,
rather than dotted line, and the south pole is at bottom left.

Fig. 4.— Reflectivity spectra of Neptune observed with VLT/MUSE compared with the
albedo spectrum of Karkoschka (1994) and recent observations with HST/WFC3 (September
2018). The top plot shows the whole VLT/MUSE spectral range, while the bottom plot shows
the 0.77 − 0.93 µm region only. Three different MUSE spectra are shown: 1) a disc-averaged
spectrum at MUSE’s native spectral resolution; 2) a disc-averaged spectrum smoothed to
a resolution of 0.002 µm; and 3) a measured, smoothed MUSE spectrum at the centre of
Neptune’s disc. Recent photometic observations by HST/WFC3 (September 2018) are shown
in cyan for comparison, with the approximate width of the filter channels indicated by the
horizontal lines.

Fig. 5.— Fit to the average observed I/F spectra in Observation ‘3’ in the 5 – 10◦ S latitude
band sampled at six viewing zenith angles corresponding with angles in the nine-zenithangle Gauss-Lobatto quadrature scheme used in our analysis. Spectra are plotted with same
vertical scale but successively offset by a reflectivity difference of 0.2 for clarity. The black
lines are the observed spectra (with errors indicated in grey) while our fits are shown in
red. At each angle, the difference is shown below in blue, together with the estimated
measurement errors, again in grey.

Fig. 6.— Retrieved cloud structure and imaginary refractive index spectra from our limbbrightening/limb-darkening analysis. The left hand panel shows our fitted cloud/aerosol
vertical profiles (in opacity/bar at 0.8 µm), with the vertical distribution of 1.0-µm cloud
particles shown as the solid curve, and the distribution of the 0.1-µm haze particles shown
as the dotted-line curve. The middle and right hand panels show the retrieved imaginary
refractive index spectra of the cloud and haze particles, respectively. Here the retrieved
spectra and errors are shown by the solid lines and light grey regions. The dark grey regions
show the assumed a priori imaginary refractive index range. Here, we see that the cloud
particles are retrieved to have low imaginary refractive index (and are thus quite scattering),
while the haze particles are retrieved to have high imaginary refractive index (and are thus
quite absorbing).

Fig. 7.— Fits to the observed spectra at our twelve sample locations (summarised in Table
2). Here the observed spectra, including error bars, are shown in grey, while our fitted
spectra are shown in red. At the top of each plot we also show the difference between the
measured and fitted spectra (in blue), multiplied by 5 and offset for clarity, together with
the error range in grey (also multiplied by 5). It can be seen that we achieve excellent fits
with χ2 /n of the order of 1.0 – 3.0. The near-horizontal lines near the reflectance peak link
the observed reflectivities at our chosen test wavelengths of 827 and 833 nm, as explained in
the text. Positive slopes indicate less methane, negative slopes indicate more methane.

Fig. 8.— Fitted methane mole fraction profiles at our sample locations, summarised in Table
2. Our methane profile is parameterised to have a constant mole fraction at deep pressures
limited to not exceed 100% relative humidity at lower pressures, with the saturated mole
fraction calculated from our assumed reference temperature profile and shown here as the
blue line. To aid comparison, the methane profile retrieved for the reference pixel area ‘9’
at 5◦ S is shown in red in all panels. In these plots the uncertainty of the profiles (modified
as described in the text) are indicated in grey. A darker grey has been used to indicate the
profile error for the reference pixel area ‘9’ at 5.1◦ S. We can see that polewards of 35◦ S there
is significantly less methane than at equatorial latitudes. The dashed blue lines show the
saturated methane mole fraction corresponding to the temperature profiles retrieved at these
latitudes by Fletcher et al.

(2014). Since these temperature profiles are generally cooler

than the reference temperature profile, the saturated methane mole fractions are generally
smaller. The horizontal black lines show the pressure where the cloud optical depth at 0.8
µm (i.e. opacity to space) is unity, while the horizontal, dashed red line shows this pressure
level for the reference pixel area ‘9’.

Fig. 9.— Latitudinal dependence of retrieved cloud opacity/bar (at 0.8 µm), deep methane
mole fraction and χ2 /ny . The top panel shows a contour plot of the fitted cloud opacity/bar
profiles at all ‘spaxels’ sampled along the central meridian (brighter regions indicate greater
cloud density, with black indicating an opacity/bar of zero and white indicated an opacity/bar of 50). Additional contour lines are drawn for opacity/bar values of 0.01, 0.1, 10 and
50. The bottom panel shows the latitudinal variation of the retrieved deep methane mole
fraction, with error bars, and the χ2 /ny of the fits. Where the cloud top intersects with the
vapour pressure curve of methane, we can only estimate a lower limit of the deeper mole
fraction, and indicate this with an arrow symbol instead of an error bar. We see a clear
decrease in methane abundance from 5–6% at near-equatorial latitudes to 3–4% polewards
of 20–40◦ S. The red line in the top plot indicates the cloud top pressure (i.e. level where
overlying cloud opacity at 0.8 µm is unity). The cloud contour map indicates the main
cloud top to lie at similar pressure levels at all latitudes and has a cloud-top pressure of
∼ 2 bar. We can also see an increase in stratospheric haze at 20 – 40◦ S, associated with the
cloudy zone and then clearing towards the north and south. The bottom plot also shows
the methane abundance estimated by Karkoschka and Tomasko (2011) (red), together with
the scaled central meridian variation of the contribution of the 3rd Empirical Orthogonal
Function we derive with our PCA analysis (blue) in section 5.

Fig. 10.— Top: Observed MUSE spectrum at disc centre (∼ 20◦ S, cross symbols) near 825
nm and fitted spectrum (black line), where the cloud opacity profiles and cloud imaginary
refractive indices have been allowed to vary, but the methane profile has been fixed to the
a priori methane abundance profile, which has a deep mole fraction of 4%. The modelled
spectrum recalculated with half or double this deep methane abundance is shown by the red
and blue lines, respectively. Also indicated by the vertical lines are the wavelengths chosen for
reflectance differencing, which probe regions of similar reflectivity (and thus similar pressure
levels) for the reference methane abundance of 4%, but whose opacities are predominantly
determined by H2 –H2 /H2 –He CIA and methane absorption, respectively. Bottom: change
in modelled reflectivity when the methane abundance is increased (blue) or decreased (red)
by 10% from the nominal value of 4%.

Fig. 11.— Reflectivity differencing method applied to all six individual MUSE observations,
indicated by the labels ‘1’ – ‘6’, showing the reflectivity at 827 nm minus the reflectivity at
833 nm, i.e. R827 − R833 . Here, as in Fig. 3 the south pole is at bottom left. The noisiness of
the first two observations (which were only integrated for 10s, rather than 120s) is clear. For
the remaining observations ‘3’ – ‘6’, these were measured with Neptune centred at different
positions within the MUSE FOV and with different position angles (corrected for here). It is
clear that residual photometric calibration ‘striping’ artefacts are apparent when comparing
just two wavelengths as we do here (i.e. the horizontal and vertical stripes). However, for
all these observations, it can be seen that the images are slightly darker at the bottom left
than top right, indicated a lower methane spectral signal near the south pole. Approaching
the south pole a faint arc (or perhaps even part of a ring) of enhanced R827 − R833 can just
be discerned in cubes ‘3’ and ‘6’, indicating possibly enhanced methane at 60 − 70◦ S.

Fig. 12.— Averaged and contrast-enhanced reflectivity observations in the H2 –H2 /H2 –He
CIA band at 827 nm (left-hand panel) and methane-band at 833 nm (middle panel) and the
difference between these averages (i.e. R827 − R833 ) (right-hand panel), all averaging over
observations ‘3’, ‘4’, and ‘6’ (observation ‘5’ was omitted as the striping artefacts were too
noticeable). The south pole of Neptune is at bottom left, and latitude circles with spacing of
20◦ are indicated. It can be seen that the reflectivity difference image (right hand panel) is
slightly darker at the bottom left than top right, indicated a lower methane spectral signal
near the south pole. We can also see a slightly brighter region circling the south pole from
60 − 70◦ S, indicating slightly higher methane abundance there, which is also just seen in our
retrieved latitudinal dependence (Fig. 9). This feature is just apparent in the H2 –H2 /H2 –He
image (left-hand panel), but not the methane-band image (middle panel), indicating that at
60 − 70◦ S we seem to have a slight thickening or vertical extension of the main cloud, which
is masked in the methane image by an accompanying increase in methane abundance and
thus absorption.

Fig. 13.— Principal component analysis applied to MUSE observation ‘3’, showing the
contribution of the first five Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF). The images in the lefthand column show the spatial variation of contribution of each EOF to the reconstructed
spectra, while the right hand column shows the associated EOF itself (i.e. spectrum). In the
images, Neptune’s south pole is again at bottom left. It can be seen that the eigenvalues of
the EOFs fall rapidly with EOF number, and that most meaningful spatial variation in the
observation is encapsulated in the first three EOFs. The shape of EOF 1 is approximately
flat and this eigenfunction seems to encapsulate the overall reflectivity as can be seen in
the associated image. EOF 2 appears to be almost the inverse of EOF 1, both in terms of
its spatial distribution and also spectral shape, although its spatial structure exhibits finer
structure, including a dark ‘halo’ about the south pole. The spatial distribution of EOF 3
has low values near Neptune’s south pole, but high values at lower latitudes, and its spectral
shape is rather distinct. The spectral shape of EOF 3 is compared here with the computed
change in modelled spectrum when the abundance of CH4 is increased (green), taken from
Fig. 10, where we can see a rough correspondence. Hence, we believe EOF 3 can be taken,
to a first approximation, as a proxy for the abundance of CH4 immediately above Neptune’s
main cloud top at ∼ 2 bar.
