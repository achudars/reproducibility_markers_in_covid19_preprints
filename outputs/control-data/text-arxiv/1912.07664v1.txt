SOLITON RESOLUTION FOR THE RADIAL CRITICAL WAVE
EQUATION IN ALL ODD SPACE DIMENSIONS
THOMAS DUYCKAERTS1 , CARLOS KENIG2 , AND FRANK MERLE3
Abstract. Consider the energy-critical focusing wave equation in odd space
dimension N ≥ 3. The equation has a nonzero radial stationary solution
W , which is unique up to scaling and sign change. In this paper we prove
that any radial, bounded in the energy norm solution of the equation behaves
asymptotically as a sum of modulated W s, decoupled by the scaling, and a
radiation term.
The proof essentially boils down to the fact that the equation does not
have purely nonradiative multisoliton solutions. The proof overcomes the fundamental obstruction for the extension of the 3D case (treated in [23]) by
reducing the study of a multisoliton solution to a finite dimensional system
of ordinary differential equations on the modulation parameters. The key ingredient of the proof is to show that this system of equations creates some
radiation, contradicting the existence of pure multisolitons.

1. Introduction
Consider the wave equation on RN , N ≥ 3, with an energy-critical focusing
nonlinearity:
(1.1)

∂t2 u − ∆u = |u| N −2 u,

and initial data
(1.2)

~u↾t=0 = (u0 , u1 ) ∈ H,

where ~u := (u, ∂t u), and H := Ḣ 1 (RN ) × L2 (RN ). The equation is locally wellposed in H (see e.g. [50], [45], [4]): for any initial data (u0 , u1 ) ∈ H, there exists a
unique maximal solution ~u ∈ C 0 ((T− , T+ ), H). The energy:

As many other nonlinear dispersive equations, equation (1.1) admits solitary
waves (or solitons) that are well-localized solutions traveling at a fixed speed. The
soliton resolution conjecture predicts that any global solution of this type of equations decouples asymptotically as a sum of decoupled solitons, a radiative term
(typically, a solution to a linear equation) and a term going to zero in the energy space. For finite time blow-up solutions, a similar decomposition should hold
depending on the nature of the blow-up.

SOLITON RESOLUTION FOR RADIAL CRITICAL WAVE EQUATION

Our main result (Theorem 1 below) is the soliton resolution for equation (1.1),
when N is odd and (u0 , u1 ) is radial. To put this result into perspective, we start
with a discussion on the soliton resolution conjecture for general nonlinear dispersive
equations.
This conjecture arose from numerical simulations and the theory of integrable
systems. It was observed in 1955 by Fermi, Pasta and Ulam [30] in one of the first
numerical experiments that a discretization of a wave equation with a quadratic
nonlinearity leads to localized, soliton-like solutions. In 1965, Zabusky and Kruskal
[68] highlighted numerically the emergence of solitons and multisolitons solutions
of the completely integrable KdV. This explained the result in [30], as Kruskal
found that, as the spacial mesh in the discretization tends to 0, the solutions of the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem converge to solutions of the KdV equation see [49]. We
refer to [37] for a survey on numerical work.
The first theoretical results in the direction of the soliton resolution were obtained
for the completely integrable KdV, mKdV and 1-dimensional cubic NLS, using the
method of inverse scattering. Namely, for KdV, a solution with smooth initial data
decaying sufficiently fast at infinity decomposes, for positive x, as a finite sum of
solitons and a term going to 0 at infinity (see [28], [27]). Note that this is only a
partial result, due to the restriction on the initial data and also to the fact that the
dispersive component, localized in {x < 0} is not completely described. We refer to
[58] for mKdV, and [69], [60], [59], [54], [2] for cubic NLS in one space dimension. A
characteristic feature of these integrable systems, already observed in [68], is that
the collision between solitons is elastic: a solution behaving as a sum of solitons as
t → +∞ also behaves as a sum of solitons, with the same parameters, as t → −∞.
Very few complete results are known for non-integrable models. A typical dispersive partial differential equation for which the soliton resolution is believed to
hold unconditionally is the energy critical wave maps. For this equation, the first
known related results were “bubble” theorems, stating that any solution developing
a singularity in finite or infinite time converges locally in space, along a sequence
of times, to a soliton (see [5, 64] for the equivariant case, [62] for the general case).
Using the “channels of energy” method coming from our previous works [20], [23],
that is closely related to the techniques that we will develop in this article, it was
proved that the soliton resolution holds for wave maps, in an equivariant setting,
with an additional assumption ruling out a multisoliton configuration [7, 8], and
that it holds for a sequence of times without this condition (see [6] and [41]). The
limiting case of a pure two-soliton is treated in [40], where it is shown in particular
that the collision between the two solitons is inelastic.
For wave maps without symmetry assumption, but with the same S 2 target, a
weak form of the soliton resolution was proved along a sequence of times (see [34]),
and the complete resolution is only known close to the ground-state [19].
The proof of the soliton resolution conjecture seems out of reach for other nonintegrable nonlinear dispersive equations, such as nonlinear Schrödinger and KleinGordon equations. Known results include scattering below a threshold given by
the ground state of the equation (see e.g. [44], [17], [36], [14]), local study close to
the ground state solution (see [53]), and in some particular cases the existence of a
global compact attractor (see [66]). We refer to the introduction of [18] for a more
complete discussion and more references on the subject.

Going back to equation (1.1), it is known that if k(u0 , u1 )kH is sufficiently small,
then T+ = ∞ and the solution scatters to a linear solution. It is also well-known
that in general finite energy solutions to equation (1.1) may blow up in finite time.
Indeed, using the finite speed of propagation for equation (1.1) to localize ODE
type blow up solutions, one can easily construct solutions ~u with T+ < ∞ and
k~u(t)kH → ∞, as t → T+ . These solutions are called type I blow-up solutions.
It is expected that these solutions, after a self-similar change of variable, satisfy a
decomposition similar to the soliton resolution. This type of result is only known
in the 1-d setting (see [52] and references therein) and very little is known in the
energy-critical case (see [15] for a local study).
To rule out the ODE type behavior, we will focus on solutions that are bounded
in the energy space, i.e. such that
(1.3)

sup
t∈[0,T+ )

k~u(t)kH < ∞.

The dynamics of these solutions is very rich. Apart from the scattering solutions
mentioned above, equation (1.1) admits also various types of finite energy steady
states Q ∈ Ḣ 1 , i.e.
(1.4)

(see [13], [11], [12]). Among them, a distinguished role is played by the ground state

(1.5)
W := 1 +

which is, as a consequence of [55, 31], the unique Ḣ 1 radial solution of (1.4) on RN ,
up to scaling and sign change, and the non-zero solution of (1.4) with least energy
(see [65]).
Stationary solutions are not the only global, non-scattering solution. It is indeed
possible to construct solutions of the form
u(t, x) = W(λ(t) (x) + vL (t, x),

where vL is a small solution of the free wave equation: see [46] (for λ(t) = 1) and
[16] (λ(t) = tη , |η| small). There also exist, at least in high space dimensions, global
solutions that are asymptotically of the form W + W(λ(t)) , where λ(t) goes to 0 as
t goes to infinity (see [39]).
There are also solutions blowing up in finite time that are bounded in the energy
space. These solutions are called type II blow-up solutions. In [48], [35], [47] and
[38], type II blow-up solutions of the form of a rescaled ground state plus a small
dispersive term were constructed. More precisely the solution is given by
u(t, x) = W(λ(t) (x) + ǫ(t, x),
→ 0+ as t → T+ , and ~ǫ(t) = (ǫ, ∂t ǫ) is small in the energy space.
where Tλ(t)
+ −t
It is expected that multisoliton concentration is also possible for type II blow-up
solutions, and it is an open problem to construct such a solution.
In the radial setting, W is the unique steady state, and thus the only soliton up to
sign change and scaling. The soliton resolution conjecture predicts that any radial
solution that does not blow up with a type I blow-up decomposes asymptotically
as a sum of ±W , decoupled by time-dependent scalings, a radiation term and a

term going to zero in the energy space. The radiation term should be a solution
to the linear wave equation in the global case, and a fixed element of H in the
finite time blow-up case. We note that all the solutions mentioned above are in
accordance with this conjecture. The resolution was proved in [23] by the authors,
for N = 3. For other dimensions (still in the radial case), soliton resolution is only
known along a sequence of times, see [9], [57] and [41]. For the non-radial settting,
for a sequence of times, see [18].
With the method of proof used in [9, 57, 41, 18], relying on monotonicity laws
giving convergence only after averaging in time, we cannot hope for more than a
decomposition for a particular sequence of times. The difficulty in obtaining the
resolution for all times is illustrated by the harmonic map heat flow equation, for
which the decomposition for a sequence of times is known, but the soliton resolution
for all times does not hold in full generality because of an example of Topping [67].
The soliton resolution for radial solutions of (1.1) holds in full generality [23]
when N = 3. The key fact in the proof is the following dispersive estimate for
radial non-zero solutions u of (1.1), with (u0 , u1 ) 6= (±W(λ) , 0), N = 3. Assume
(for simplicity) that u exists globally in time. Then

where Π⊥
P (R) denotes the orthogonal projection onto the orthogonal complement of
P (R) in H(R). The analog of (1.7) for higher odd dimension was obtained in [43],
[42], but the exceptional subspace P (R) is replaced by a finite dimensional subspace
of H(R) with dimension increasing to infinity with N . The fact that the dimension
of P (R) is strictly greater than one for N ≥ 5 is responsible for the failure of this
method, since we only have here the one parameter scaling invariance to deal with
this failure, to start the proof. Let us mention however that it is possible, using
(1.7), to prove that in odd space dimensions N ≥ 5, any radial solution of (1.1)
that does not satisfy (1.6) is asymptotically close, for large r, to one of the elements
of P (R) (see [24]).
The radial solution u of (1.1) is said to be a pure multisoliton (asymptotically
as t → ±∞) when there exist J ≥ 2 scaling parameters 0 < λJ (t) ≪ . . . ≪ λ2 (t) ≪

where o(1) goes to 0 in H (see [39] for an example of pure multisoliton). If u
is both a pure multisoliton as t → +∞ and t → −∞, we say that the collision
between the solitons is elastic. In space dimension 3, the fact that (1.6) is valid
for any nonstationary solution u rules out elastic collisions, in stark contrast to
the integrable case [37]. One of the main results in this work, is a slightly weaker

for some large M > 0 (see Propositions 5.1 and 6.1). As a consequence, there does
not exist a radial solution of (1.1) that is a pure multisoliton both as t → ∞ and
t → −∞, i.e. the collision of solitons is inelastic for (1.1), when N is odd. The
proof of this property depends
heavily on the “energy
channels” property for the

u = 0, established in [25]. The M
linearized wave equation ∂t − ∆ − N −2 W

in (1.8) is needed to eliminate the extra dimensions arising from P in (1.7), when
N ≥ 5, odd.
The main result in this work, namely full resolution for (1.1), N odd, in the
radial case (assuming bounded energy norm) combines the sequence of times result
in [61] with a strengthened version of (1.8). The result of [61] allows us to reduce
ourselves to studying the dynamics close to a sum of solitons plus a dispersive
term, and the strenghtened version of (1.8) allows us to take advantage of the fact
that the collision of two or more solitons produce dispersion, which then gives the
full decomposition. We view this as a “road map” to attack soliton resolution in
non-integrable settings.
We now turn to the main results of this paper. If a and b are integers with a < b,
we denote Ja, bK = [a, b] ∩ N.

Then (u0, u1 ) = (0, 0) or there exists λ > 0, ι ∈ {±1} such that (u0 , u1 ) =

Note that (1.10) exactly means that the linear component vL is identically 0
both as t → +∞ and t → −∞, so that Theorem 2 rules out being asymptotically
a multisoliton at both t = +∞ and t = −∞, in stark contrast to the completely
integrable case [37]. For results on inelastic soliton collisions for equation (1.1)
without a radiality assumption, see [51].
The outline of the paper is as follows. The preliminary section 2 is mainly
devoted to the Cauchy theory for equation (1.1). We recall well-posedness results
from [32], [33], [45], and more particularly from [4], where the high-dimensional
case is treated. Using finite speed of propagation, we also recall a local and global
Cauchy theory for the equation (1.1) in the exterior of a wave cone {|x| > R + |t|},
R ≥ 0, as developed in [24]. Section 3 concerns the bound from below of the exterior
energy for linear equations with a potential. After recalling the main result of [25],
we state and prove an exterior energy bound for the linearized operator close to a
multisoliton. In Section 4, we consider solutions of the equation (1.1) such that
Z
lim
|∇t,x u|2 dx = 0,
t→+∞

|x|>|t|+R

for some fixed R > 0. We recall from [24] that the initial data of these solutions
(that we call non-radiative solutions) have a prescribed asymptotic behaviour. We
also consider the case of non-radiative solutions that are close to a multisoliton,
proving a bound from below of the exterior scaling parameter λ1 . In Section 5,
we reduce the proof of the soliton resolution to the study of a finite dimensional
dynamical system on the scaling parameters λj and some of the coefficients arising
in the expansion of the solution. Finally in Section 6 we prove a blow-up/ejection
result for this dynamical system and conclude the proof. Section 7 is dedicated to
a short sketch of the proof of Theorem 2, which is a byproduct of part of the proof
of Theorem 1. A few computations are gathered in the appendix.

If A is a space of distributions on RN , we will denote by Arad the subspace
of A consisting of the elements of A that are radial. We will, without making a
distinction, consider a radial function as depending on the variable x ∈ RN or the
variable r = |x|.
If Ω is an open subset of Rn , (n = N or n = N + 1), and A = A(Rn ) a Banach
space of distributions on Rn , we recall that A(Ω) is the set of restrictions of elements
of A to Ω, with the norm
kukA(Ω) := inf kũkA(Rn ) .
ũ

where the infimum is taken over all ũ ∈ A(Rn ) such that ũ↾Ω = u. To lighten
notation, if R > 0 and n = N , we will denote by


A(R) := Arad x ∈ RN s.t. |x| > R .

We will mainly use this notation with H, so that H(R) is the space of radial
distributions (u0 , u1 ) defined for r > R such that

We will often consider solutions of the wave equation in the exterior of wave
cones. For R > 0, we denote
ΓR (t0 , t1 ) = {|x| > R + |t|, t ∈ [t0 , t1 ]}.
To lighten notations, we will denote
ΓR = ΓR (0, ∞).

ΓR (T ) = ΓR (0, T ),
We denote by SL (t) the linear wave group:

We note that by finite speed of propagation, the restriction of u to ΓR (T ) depends
only on the restriction of f to ΓR (T ) and the restriction of (u0 , u1 ) to {r > R}.

k · kẆ s,p defined by
kf kẆ s,p := kDs f kLp ,

where Ds is the Fourier multiplier of symbol |ξ|s . We denote by Ḃp,q

If I is an interval, we will denote by S(I), W(I), W′ (I) the restriction of these
spaces to I × RN .
We will need the following Strichartz estimates (see [63] [33]): if t0 ∈ I, f ∈
W′ (I), (u0 , u1 ) ∈ H, then u (defined by (2.3)) is in S(I) ∩ W(I) and

We denote F (u) = |u| N −2 u.

Definition 2.1. Let I be an interval with t0 ∈ I, (u0 , u1 ) ∈ H. If N ≥ 6, we call

If N ∈ {3, 4, 5}, a solution is defined in the same way, with the additional requirement that u ∈ S(J × RN ) for all compact intervals J ⊂ I.
It is known (see [33], [45] and [4]), that for all initial data (u0 , u1 ), there is a
unique maximal solution u defined on a maximal interval (T− , T+ ) and that satisfies
the following blow-up criterion:
T+ < ∞ =⇒ kukS([t0 ,T+ )) = ∞.

We next recall from [24] the definition and some properties of solutions of (1.1) on
the exterior ΓR (t0 , t1 ) of wave cones. We will use the following continuity property

cones:

(2.7)

N −2
kukW((0,T )) ,
k11ΓR (T ) F (u)kW′ ((0,T )) . kukS(Γ

which is proved in [24] as a consequence of Lemma 2.2, Hölder’s inequality and the
usual chain rule for fractional derivative ([4, Lemma 2.10]).
Definition 2.3. Let t0 < t1 , R ≥ 0. Let (u0 , u1 ) ∈ H(R). A solution u of (1.1)
on ΓR (t0 , t1 ) with initial data (u0 , u1 ) is the restriction to ΓR (t0 , t1 ) of a solution
ũ ∈ C 0 ([t0 , t1 ], Ḣ 1 ) with ∂t ũ ∈ C 0 ([t0 , t1 ], L2 ), to the equation:
4

∂t2 ũ − ∆ũ = |ũ| N −2 ũ11{|x|>R+|t|} ,

(2.8)
with an initial data

~ũ↾t=t0 = (ũ0 , ũ1 ),

(2.9)

where (ũ0 , ũ1 ) ∈ H is an extension of (u0 , u1 )
Note that by finite speed of propagation, the value of u on ΓR (t0 , t1 ) does not
depend on the choice of (ũ0 , ũ1 ), provided (ũ0 , ũ1 ) and (u0 , u1 ) coincide for r > R.
Using Lemma 2.2 and finite speed of propagation, the Cauchy theory in [4] (or
[45] for the case N ∈ {3, 4, 5}) adapts easily to the case of solutions outside wave
cones. We give some of the statements, and omit the proofs that are the same as
in [45], [4]. We refer to [24, Section 2] for a more complete exposition. The space
S(ΓR (T )) in the following proposition is defined in Subsection 2.1.
Proposition 2.4 (Local well-posedness). Let R ≥ 0, (u0 , u1 ) ∈ H(R) and T > 0.
Assume
k(u0 , u1 )kH(R) ≤ A.

Then there exists η = η(A) such that if

kSL (t)(u0 , u1 )kS(ΓR (T )) < η,
then there exists a unique solution u to (1.1) on ΓR (T ). Furthermore for all t ∈
[0, T ],
~L (t)(u0 , u1 )kH(R+|t|) ≤ Cη θN A1−θN
k~u(t) − S
for some constant θN depending only on N .

(See [4, Theorem 3.3]).
 We have the following blow-up criterion, see [24, Lemma
2.8]: if u ∈ S ΓR (TR+ ) , then TR+ = +∞. Furthermore, u scatters to a linear
solution for {|x| > R + |t|}: there exists a solution vL of the linear wave equation
on R × RN such that
(2.10)

lim k~u(t) − ~vL (t)kH(R+|t|) = 0.

t→+∞

We also have the following long-time perturbation theory result (see [45, Theorem 2.20], [4, Theorem 3.6], [57, Proposition A.1]).
Proposition 2.5. Let A > 0. There exists η0 = η0 (A) with the following property.
Let R > 0, T ∈ (0, ∞], (u0 , u1 ) ∈ H(R) and (v0 , v1 ) ∈ H(R). Assume that v is a
~ ∈ C 0 ([0, T ], H) and
restriction to ΓR (0, T ) of a function V such that V
∂t2 V − ∆V = 11{|x|>R+|t|} (F (V ) + e1 + e2 ) ,

Then we have the following superposition principle outside the wave cone Γ0 :=

(t, x) ∈ R × RN : |x| > t > 0 .
Proposition 2.7. Let {(u0,n , u1,n )}n be a bounded sequence in Hrad . Assume that
for all j such that τj = 0, the nonlinear profile U j can be extended to a solution on
Γ0 (in the sense of Definition 2.3) such that U j ∈ S(Γ0 ). Then for large n, there is
a solution un defined on Γ0 with initial data {(u0,n , u1,n )}n at t = 0. Furthermore,
denoting, for J ≥ 1, (t, r) ∈ Γ0

We omit the proof, which is similar to the proof when the solution is not restricted
to the exterior of a wave cone (see [57, Proposition 2.3]). Let us emphasize the fact
that under the assumptions of Proposition 2.7, the profiles Unj (t, r) are well-defined
on Γ0 , so that the conclusion of the proposition makes sense. If τj = 0, this follows
from the assumption that U j is defined on Γ0 and if τj = +∞, from the fact that
U j is globally defined in the future. Finally, if τj = −∞, it follows from the fact
that U j is globally defined in the past, and also, using small data theory, defined
on a cone ΓR (T, +∞) where T is fixed in the interval of existence of U j and R is
large (see also the discussion after Proposition 2.11 in [24]).

3. Channels of energy for the linearized operator close to a
multisoliton
This section is devoted to the proof of an exterior energy bound, stated in §3.2,
for the equation (1.1) linearized around a multisoliton. We start (see Subsection
3.1) by recalling previous results obtained in [21] and [25], on exterior energy bounds
for the free wave equation and the linearized equation around a single soliton.
3.1. Channels of energy for the free and the linearized wave equations.
In [21], we have obtained the following exterior energy lower bound for solutions of
the free wave equation:
Theorem 3.1. Assume N is odd. Let uF be a solution of the free wave equation:
∂t2 uF − ∆uF = 0

Let W be the ground-state stationary solution of (1.1), given by (1.5). Consider

(3.2)

where LW is the linearized operator:

The existence and uniqueness of solutions of (3.2) with initial data in H can be
easily proved by standard semi-group theory. In [25], we have proved an analog of
Theorem 3.1 for solutions of (3.2) that we will now describe. To lighten notations,
we will restrict to radial functions in space dimension N ≥ 5. Let

Then

: LW Z = 0 .

Indeed the inclusion ⊂ is due to the fact that (1.1) is invariant by scaling. The
other inclusion is a well-known nondegeneracy property of W (see e.g. [56]). Note
that ΛW ∈ L2 since N ≥ 5. Let


Z := span ΛW × span ΛW .

If (u0 , u1 ) ∈ Z, then the solution u of (3.2) with initial data (u0 , u1 ) is given by
u(t, x) = u0 (x) + tu1 (x) and in particular
Z
X
lim
|∇t,x u(t, x)|2 = 0.

t→±∞

|x|≥|t|

If V is a closed subspace of H, we denote by V ⊥ its orthogonal in H, and πV the
orthogonal projection on V . Theorem 1 of [25] states that the solutions with initial
data in Z are the only solutions that do not satisfy an exterior energy lower bound:
Theorem 3.2. Assume N ≥ 5 is odd. Then there exists a constant C > 0 such
that for all (u0 , u1 ) ∈ Hrad ,

where u is the solution of (3.2) with initial data (u0 , u1 ).
Theorem 1 of [25] is indeed more general: it holds without the assumption that
(u0 , u1 ) is radial, and also in space dimension N = 3, with a suitable definition of
Z. We refer to [25] for the details.
3.2. Bound from below of the exterior energy close to a multisoliton. As
a corollary of Theorem 3.2, we will prove an exterior energy lower bound for the
linearized operator close to an approximate radial multisoliton solution. We will
consider only radial solutions, and fix J ≥ 2.
We denote by GJ the subset of (0, ∞)J :

SOLITON RESOLUTION FOR RADIAL CRITICAL WAVE EQUATION

Recall that U j (for j ≥ J + 1) and wnK (for any K ≥ 1) are solutions of the free
wave equation. The inequalities (3.29) for j ≥ J + 1, and (3.30) thus follow from
the exterior energy bound in odd dimension proved in [22] (recalled in Theorem
3.1 above). We next prove (3.29) when j satisfies 1 ≤ j ≤ J. According to the
channels of energy for the linearized equation at W (Theorem 3.2), it is sufficient
to prove
Z
Z
(3.33)
∇U j (0, x) · ∇ΛW (x) dx = ∂t U j (0, x)ΛW (x) = 0.

To prove (3.33), notice that by weak convergence:

since (v0,n , v1,n ) ∈ Zλ⊥n . By the same proof, ∂t U j (0, x)ΛW (x) dx = 0, concluding
the proof of (3.33) and thus of (3.29).
We next prove (3.31) and (3.32). We will use the pseudo-orthogonality of the
parameters (2.11). We focus on the limits as t → +∞, the proof for the limits
as t → −∞ is the same. Using the radiation term for the free wave equation (see
appendix of [26]) if j ≥ J + 1, or for the linearized wave equation (see (2.20)) if
1 ≤ j ≤ J, we obtain that for all j ≥ 1, there exists g j ∈ L2 (R) such that

4. Non-radiative solutions close to a multisoliton
4.1. Preliminaries.

Definition 4.1. Let t0 ∈ R, and u be a solution of the nonlinear wave equation
(1.1) (or another wave equation considered in this paper). We say that u is nonradiative at t = t0 if u is defined on {|x| > |t − t0 |} and
Z
X
lim
|∇t,x u(t, x)|2 dx = 0.

We say that u is weakly non-radiative if for large R > 0, u is defined on {|x| > |t|+R}
and
Z
X
lim
|∇t,x u(t, x)|2 dx = 0.
±

t→±∞

|x|≥|t|+R

If N ≥ 3 is odd, according to the equirepartition property recalled in Theorem
3.1, the only non-radiative solution of (3.1) is zero. This fact persists if N ≥ 4 is
even (see [24, Proposition 1]), as a consequence of the asymptotic formula in [10].
In odd space dimension N ≥ 5, the non-radiative solutions for the linearized
wave equation around the stationary solutions W are also known, as a consequence
of the main result of [25] (recalled in Theorem 3.2 above in the radial case).
Radial weakly non-radiative solutions of the free wave equation were explicited
in [42]. Let

if and only if ~v (0) ∈ P (R).
From [23], if N = 3, the only radial, non-radiative solutions of (1.1) are the
stationary solutions. The proof is specific to dimension 3, and the results available
in higher dimension are less precise. We next recall from [24] some of these results,

22

that will be needed in the sequel. Let m = N2−1 be the number of elements of P.
As in [24], we denote by P = {Ξk }k∈J1,mK , choosing Ξk so that
ck

kΞk kH(R) = k− 1 ,

for some constant ck 6= 0. In particular, we choose Ξm (r) = r2−N , 0 . By scaling, one can check that if U ∈ P (R) and (θk (R))k∈J1,mK are its coordinates in
(Ξ1 , . . . , Ξm ), then

where the implicit constant is independent of R > 0 (see [24, Claim 3.2]). Then:

Theorem 4.2. Assume N ≥ 5 is odd. There exists ε0 > 0 with the following
property. Let u be a radial weakly non-radiative solution of (1.1). Then there exist
k0 ∈ J1, mK, ℓ ∈ R (with ℓ 6= 0 if k0 < m) such that, for all t0 ∈ R and R0 > 0, if
u is defined on {(t, r), r > |t − t0 | + R0 }, k~u(t0 )kH(R0 ) < ε0 and

See Theorem 2 and Remark 3.4 in [24]. If k0 = m, the theorem implies that u is
close, for large r, to one of the stationary solutions 0 (if ℓ = 0) or ±W(λ) for some λ
depending on ℓ (if ℓ 6= 0). Under the stronger assumption that u is non-radiative,
Theorem 3 of [24] gives a uniqueness result in this case.
Theorem 4.3. Assume N ≥ 5 is odd. Let u be a radial non-radiative solution of
(1.1). Let k0 be as in Theorem 4.2. Assume that k0 = m. Then u is a stationary
solution.
In the remainder of this section, we will assume N ≥ 5 is odd and consider a
nonradiative solution close to a multisoliton. In Subsection 4.2, we will use the
exterior energy bound for the linearized equation proved in Section 3 to give a first
order expansion of the solution. In Subsection 4.3 we will use Theorems 4.2 and 4.3
to give a lower bound of the exterior scaling parameter of the multisoliton. These
properties will be crucial in the proofs of the soliton resolution in Sections 5 and 6.
4.2. Estimates on the coefficients. In this subsection, we assume as before that
J
N ≥ 5 is odd.
 We fix JN ≥ 1, (ιj ) ∈ {±1} , and consider a radial solution u of (1.1),
defined on (t, x) ∈ R : |x| > t , which is non-radiative at t = 0 (see Definition
4.1). We assume that there exists λ = (λj )J ∈ GJ such that:

5. Reduction to a system of differential inequalities
The proof of Theorem 1 is by contradiction. Consider a global solution that does
not satisfy the soliton resolution conjecture. Then by the work of C. Rodriguez [57]
it is close, for a sequence of times {tn }n going to infinity, to a sum of rescaled
solitary waves.
Using the study on non-radiative solutions carried out in Section 4 and the equation (1.1), linearized around a sum of solitary waves, we will obtain an approximate
differential system satisfied around tn by the scaling parameters modulating the stationary solutions. We then deduce a contradiction from this system and differential
inequality arguments. We divide the proof into two sections. In this section we
will set up the contradiction argument and obtain some differential inequalities. In
the next section we will restrict the time interval to prove a crucial lower bound
(consequence of Proposition 4.6 above) on one of the scaling parameters, and prove
that the differential system, together with this lower bound leads to a contradiction.
This section and Section 6 concern the case of global solution. We omit the very
close proof for finite time blow-up solutions (see e.g. Section 4 of [23]).

lim dJ,ι (~u(tn ) − ~vL (tn )) = 0.

(5.4)

We will prove by contradiction that limt→∞ dJ,ι (~u(t) − ~vL (t)) = 0. We thus assume
that there exists a small ε0 > 0 and a sequence {t̃n }n → +∞ such that

We will denote U = u − vL and use notations that are analogs to the ones of
Subsection 4.2, although the setting is a bit different.
The implicit function theorem (see Lemma B.1 in the appendix) implies that for
all t ∈ [t̃n , tn ], we can choose λ(t) = (λ1 (t), . . . , λJ (t)) ∈ GJ such that

Let us mention that the constants κ0 and κ1 can be computed explicitely. However we will not need their exact values in the sequel.
The proof of Proposition 5.1 is based on the results of Subsection 4.2 on nonradiative solutions. We will first consider, in Subsection 5.2, a profile decomposition
~ (sn ) = ~u(sn ) − ~vL (sn ), (where sn → ∞) observing that any
for a sequence of U
nonlinear profile in this decomposition is non-radiative. In Subsection 5.3, we will
use this observation and an expansion of the energy to deduce estimates on λj , βj ,
γ and δ. In Subsection 5.4, we will obtain estimates on λ′j and βj′ using the equation
(1.1) and the orthogonality conditions, and conclude the proof of (5.13),. . . , (5.16).
We refer to [40, Proposition 3.8] for modulation equations similar to the ones
of Proposition 5.1, in the context of equivariant wave maps, when J = 2, at the
threshold energy (so that in this work the analog of the radiation term vL is 0).
One important novelty here compared to Proposition 3.8 in [40] and its proof, is the
~ (sn )} are nonradiative
proof that the nonlinear profiles associated to a sequence {U
solutions of (1.1) (see Lemma 5.2 below), yielding a crucial additional information.
5.2. Expansion along a sequence of times and renormalization. Consider
a sequence of times {sn }n with sn ∈ [t̃n , tn ] for all n. Extracting subsequences,
we define a partition of the interval J1, JK as follows. We let 1 = j1 < j2 < . . . <
jK+1 = J + 1, so that J1, JK = ∪K

(VFk )k≥1 and parameters {µk,n , sk,n }n , k ≥ 1, where for k ∈ J1, KK, µk,n = λjk (sn ),
sk,n = 0 and VFk is the solution of the free linear wave equation with initial data

In view of (5.32) all the nonlinear profiles V k , k ≥ K + 1 are globally defined

(4.7) and (4.8) for non-radiative solution. We will prove (5.44) as a consequence of

6. End of the proof
6.1. Exit time for a system of differential inequalities. Using Proposition 5.1
and a lower bound on one of the scaling parameters λj (consequence of Proposition
4.6), we will reduce the proof to the following proposition:
Proposition 6.1. Let C > 0, J0 ≥ 2, a > 0. There exists ε = ε(C, J0 , a) > 0, such
that for all L > 0, there exists T ∗ = T ∗ (L, C, J0 , a) with the following property. For
all T > 0, for all C 1 functions
λ = (λj )j : [0, T ] → GJ0

Remark 6.2. Let us emphasize that T ∗ is independent of ε > 0 if it is chosen small
enough, and that ε does not depend on L.
We postpone the proof of Proposition 6.1 to Subsection 6.4 and conclude the
proof of Theorem 1 in the two next subsections. In view of Proposition 5.1,
(λj )1≤j≤J , and (βj )1≤j≤J satisfy the assumptions of Proposition 6.1, except for
the lower bound (6.5) and up to terms that are on (1). In Subsection 6.2, we will

46

T. DUYCKAERTS, C. KENIG, AND F. MERLE

eliminate the on (1) terms. In order to do this, we will ignore all the exterior profiles
that are equal to ±W , restricting to indices j ∈ JJe, JK for an appropriate index Je
and to a time interval [t̃n , t′n ] strictly included in [t̃n , tn ]. In Subsection 6.3 we will
show that the new exterior scaling parameter λJe satisfies the lower bound (6.5) and
conclude the proof of Theorem 1 assuming Proposition 6.1. Finally in Subsection
6.4 we prove Proposition 6.1.
6.2. Restriction of the indices and of the time interval. Recall from Subsection 5.1 the definitions of tn , t̃n , J, and for j ∈ J1, JK, ιj , αj (t), βj (t), λj (t).

the proof of Lemma 6.3.

Assuming (6.30) and (6.31), the conclusion of Lemma 6.4 follows easily from Proposition 5.1. Indeed by (6.30) and (6.31), restricting t to [t̃n , t′n ], we can replace
γ(t) + on (1) by γ̃(t) in the right-hand side of (5.14), (5.15) and (5.16). Similarly,

using again (6.30) and (6.31), we can restrict the indices in the sums in the lefte J]) and
hand side of (5.15) to Je ≤ j. This yields that (6.12), (6.13) (for j ∈ [J,

6.3. Lower bound for the exterior scaling parameter and end of the proof.
In this subsection we conclude the contradiction argument started in Section 5,
using the same notations as in Section 5 and Subsection 6.2. We recall in particular
that t′n = t̃n + T λJ,n

λJ,n

of the proof in order to obtain a contradiction with Proposition 6.1. In all the
argument T is chosen first, and the small parameter ε0 appearing in (5.7) might
depend on T . The constants are independent of ε0 .
Lemma 6.6. Let ℓ and p0 be defined by (6.21). Then if ε0 = ε0 (T ) is chosen small

The proof is by contradiction and relies on a monotonicity formula that follows
from the modulation equations (6.2),. . . ,(6.5). In all the proof, the estimates are
uniform in t ∈ [0, T ], and we must follow the dependence of the constants with
respect to L. The implicit constants implied by the symbols ., ≪, . . . will thus
never depend on L and t ∈ [0, T ]. We will introduce in the course of the proof two
constants m and M depending only on L and the parameters of the system. To

7. Inelastic collision
This section is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 2. The proof is almost contained in the proof of Theorem 1 and we only sketch it. Let u satisfy the assumptions
of Theorem 2. If u scatters forward in time, then
lim k~u(t)kH = 0,

t→+∞

and by the small data theory, u is identically 0. Thus u does not scatter as t → ∞,
and according to Theorem 1, there exists J ≥ 1, signs {ιj }1≤j≤J , parameters λj (t)
defined for large t and such that
0 < λJ (t) < λJ−1 (t) < . . . < λ1 (t),

lim γ(t) = 0,

t→∞

lim λ1 (t)/t = 0,

(where γ(t) = γ(λ(t)) = maxj∈J1,J−1K λj+1 (t)/λj (t)) and
lim ~u(t) −

Note that (1.10) implies that vL ≡ 0. We will use the notations of Section 5. Using
Lemma B.1 in the appendix, we can choose the λj (t), for large t such that
Z

(7.1)
∀j ∈ J1, JK,
∇(u(t) − M (t)) · ∇ ΛW(λj (t)) = 0,

where M (t) :=

u(t) = M (t) + h(t),

For t ≥ T , T large, we expand
∂t u(t) =

and denote

δ(t) := kh(t)k2Ḣ 1 + k∂t u(t)k2L2 ,

βj (t) := −ιj

Z

(ΛW )[λj (t)] ∂t u(t).

Observe that the expansions above are valid for all large times, as opposed to the
analoguous expansions in Section 5 that are made on intervals of the form [t̃n , tn ],
where t̃n and tn → ∞ as n → ∞.

where the positive constants κ0 , κ1 are as in Proposition 5.1.
Sketch of proof. The proof is the same as the proof of Proposition 5.1 in Subsections
5.3 and 5.4, observing that in the context of Proposition 7.1, we do not need
Subsection 5.2 and we can remove all the on (1) in the estimates. More precisely:
• The estimates of Lemma 5.4 hold for t ≥ T , without the on (1) terms, as a
direct consequence of Proposition 4.4.
• The estimates of Lemma 5.5 can be proved for all t ≥ T , without the on (1)
terms, expanding the equality:
E(~u(t)) = JE(W, 0),
and with the same proof. In Lemma 5.5, the terms on (1) came from the
fact that the preceding equality was replaced by the weaker statement:
lim E(~u(t) − ~vL (t)) = JE(W, 0).

t→∞

• Similarly, one can prove Lemma 5.6 and Lemma 5.7 for t ≥ T without on (1)
with the same proofs, observing that in the proofs of these Lemmas, the
on (1) terms come either from the on (1) terms of Subsection 5.3, or from
the term σ(h, vL ) defined in (5.54) and which is 0 in our setting.
Assuming that u is not stationary, it is now easy to obtain a contradiction: by
Proposition 4.6,
∀t ≥ T,

2

k − 12

|ℓ| ≤ Cδ(t) N λ10

.

Combining with the estimates of Proposition 7.1, we see that this contradicts Proposition 6.1, concluding the proof.

The same inequalities remain valid when replacing W by ΛW anywhere in the

By scaling, we can assume µ = 1. By symmetry, it is sufficient to bound the

Proof. We fix (y1 , . . . , yJ , h) ∈ RJ+1 and distinguish between two cases.
Case 1 (|h| ≥ max1≤j≤J |yj |). In this case, the inequality is trivial since all terms
2N
of the left-hand side are bounded by |h| N −2 up to a constant.
Case 2 (|h| ≤ max1≤j≤J |yj |). We assume without loss of generality

where
G(b, c) := |F (1 + b + c) − F (1 + b) − F (1 + c) + F (1)|.
We distinguish between two cases.
Case 1 (|c| ≤ |b|). There exists b1 and d1 such that
F (1 + b + c) − F (1 + b) = F ′ (b1 )c,

(A.28)

|b + 1 − b1 | ≤ |c|

F (1 + c) − F (1) = F (d1 )c,

|d1 − 1| ≤ |c|.

, this implies (A.27), since N4−2 ≤ 2(N
If |b| ≥ 10

If |b| ≤ 10 , we use that F is C 2 outside the origin. Thus there exists d2 ∈ [b1 , d1 ]
(or [d1 , b1 ]) such that

F ′ (b1 ) − F ′ (d1 ) = F ′′ (d2 )(d1 − b1 ).
Since

2

≤ d2 ≤ 2, we have |F ′′ (d2 )| . 1 and we obtain by the triangle inequality
|b1 − d1 | ≤ |b1 − (1 + b)| + |d1 − 1| + |b| ≤ |c| + |b|,

which yields
|G(b, c)| = |F ′′ (d2 )(b1 − d1 )c| ≤ |c|(|c| + |b|),
yielding (A.27) since |c| ≤ |b| ≤

and

N +2

Case 2 (|c| ≥ |b|). The same proof as in the preceding case, inverting b and c, yields

and, if |c| ≤

Proof of (A.25) in the case N = 5. By homogeneity, we can assume a = 1, and we
are thus reduce to prove, with the same notation G(b, c) as before,
1

|G(b, c)| . |b| |c| (1 + |b| + |c|) 3 .
The inequality is symmetric in (b, c) and we can assume |b| ≥ |c|. Again, we use
that there exist b1 and d1 such that (A.28) and (A.29) hold. Since F is of class C 2 ,
we also know that there exists d2 ∈ [b1 , d1 ] (or [d1 , b1 ]) such that
F ′ (b1 ) − F ′ (d1 ) = F ′′ (d2 )(d1 − b1 ).
1

We have |d1 − b1 | . |b| + |c| . |b|, and |F ′′ (d2 )| . (1 + |b| + |c|) 3 , and thus

|G(b, c)| = |F ′′ (d2 )(d1 − b1 )c| . |c| |b| (1 + |b| + |c|) 3 .
