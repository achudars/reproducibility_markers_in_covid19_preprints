We perform a global sensitivity analysis of the binding energy and the charge radius of the nucleus
O to identify the most influential low-energy constants in the next-to-next-to-leading order chiral
Hamiltonian with two- and three-nucleon forces. For this purpose we develop a subspace-projected
coupled-cluster method using eigenvector continuation [Frame D. et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121,
032501 (2018)]. With this method we compute the binding energy and charge radius of 16 O at more
than one million different values of the 16 low-energy constants in one hour on a standard laptop. For
relatively small subspace projections, the root-mean-square error is about 1% compared to full space
coupled-cluster results. We find that 58(1)% of the variance in the energy can be apportioned to a
single contact-term in the 3 S1 -wave, whereas the radius depends sensitively on several low-energy
constants and their higher-order correlations. The results identify the most important parameters
for describing nuclear saturation, and help prioritize efforts for uncertainty reduction of theoretical
predictions. The achieved acceleration opens up for an array of computational statistics analyses of
the underlying description of the strong nuclear interaction in nuclei across the Segré chart.

Introduction.- How do properties of atomic nuclei depend on the underlying interaction between protons and
neutrons? Recent ab initio computations of nuclei [1–
16] have revealed that observables such as binding energies, radii, spectra, and decay probabilities are very sensitive to the values of the low-energy constants (LECs) in
chiral Hamiltonian models with two- and three-nucleon
forces [17–19]. Certain interaction models work better
than others, but only for selected types of observables
and in limited regions of the Segré chart. It is not clear
why. The NNLOsat interaction [20] reproduces experimental binding energies and charge radii for nuclei up to
mass A ∼ 50 [4, 5, 9, 16], while the 1.8/2.0 (EM) interaction [21, 22] reproduces binding energies and low-lying
energy spectra up to mass A ∼ 100 [4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15]
while radii are underestimated.
To improve theoretical predictions requires rigorous
uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analyses that
are grounded in the description of the underlying nuclear Hamiltonian. Unfortunately, the number of model
samples required for statistical computing increases exponentially with the number of uncertain LECs. A global
sensitivity analysis of the ground-state energy and charge
radius 16 O, based on a realistic next-to-next-to-leading
order (NNLO) chiral Hamiltonian with 16 LECs, requires
more than one million model evaluations. Similar numbers can be expected for Markov Chain Monte Carlo
sampling of Bayesian marginalization end evidence integrals [23–25]. Clearly, this is not feasible given the
computational cost of existing state-of-the-art ab initio
many-body methods applied to medium-mass and heavy
nuclei.
In this Letter we solve this problem by utilizing eigenvector continuation [26] to develop a subspace-projected
coupled-cluster (SP-CC) method as a fast and accurate

approximation to the corresponding full-space coupledcluster (CC) method [27–33]. The SP-CC method generalizes the eigenvector-continuation formalism in Ref. [34]
to non-Hermitian problems and enables accelerated computation of nuclear observables across the Segré chart
for any target value α
~ } of the LECs in the underlying
Hamiltonian. See Fig. 1 for a demonstration of the SPCC method applied to 16 O and the variation of a single
LEC (details are given below). We will use SP-CC to analyze the description of the 16 O ground-state energy and
charge radius across a large domain of relevant LECs.
This way we can for the first time clearly identify the
LECs that have the biggest impact on binding energy
and radius predictions, which in turn impacts saturation
properties of nuclear matter [8, 35, 36].
Method.– Following Ref. [34] we start by representing the chiral Hamiltonian at NNLO H(~
α) as a linear combination
with
respect
to
all
the
LECs
α
~ ; i.e.
PNLECs =16
H(~
α) = i=0
αi hi , with the zeroth term given by
h0 = tkin + V0 and α0 = 1. Here tkin is the intrinsic
kinetic energy and V0 denotes a constant potential term.
The analytical form of the NNLO Hamiltonian is identical to the one of NNLOsat [20], which means that for
a particular value α
~ = α
~ ? the Hamiltonian H(~
α? ) will
reproduce the binding energy and radius predictions of
NNLOsat . The SP-CC Hamiltonian for a target value
α
~ = α
~ } is constructed by projecting H(~
α} ) onto the
subspace spanned by CC wavefunctions obtained at Nsub
different values for α
~ . SP-CC is a controlled approximation to the full-space CC method, and allows for rapid
and accurate solutions to the many-nucleon problem necessary for statistical computing. In this Letter we use the
CC method in the singles- and doubles approximation
(CCSD).
The workhorse of the CC method is the similar-

The reference state |Φ0 i is built from harmonic oscillator
single-particle states, and we solve the CCSD equations
in a model-space comprising 11 major oscillator shells
with a frequency ~Ω = 16 MeV. The matrix-elements
of the three-nucleon interaction that enters the Hamiltonian are truncated by the energy cut E3max ≤ 14. The

and H(~

tonian. The left ground-state hΨ̃0 | = hΦ0 |(1 + Λ0 )e−T is
obtained from H(~
α0 ), and the right ground-state eT |Φ0 i
is obtained from H(~
α), respectively. We can now solve
the generalized non-Hermitian Nsub × Nsub eigenvalue
problem for the SP-CC target Hamiltonian to obtain the
ground-state energy and wavefunction in the subspace.
With the SP-CC wavefunction we can also calculate
the expectation value of any subspace-projected operator
with matrix elements hΨ̃0 |O|Ψi. Equations (2) and (3)
can be evaluated using Wick’s theorem and closed form
algebraic expressions are given in the Supplementary Material. Note that in general the reference states for the
Nsub different subspace CC wavefunctions in Eq. (1) are
non-orthogonal. This is a non-trivial case and would require the generalized Wick’s theorem [37, 38] in order to
evaluate the matrix elements of the SP-CC Hamiltonian
and the norm matrix.
Results.– The SP-CC predictions for the energy and
charge radius in 16 O as a function of the LEC C1 S0 in
the Hamiltonian are shown in Fig 1. Using Nsub = 5
exact CCSD ground-state vectors, from a small region
of C1 S0 values, points 1-5 in Fig. 1, the SP-CC method
extrapolates to the exact CCSD results across a large
C1 S0 range. With Nsub = 3 CCSD vectors, points 1-3
in Fig. 1, the radius extrapolation deteriorates far away
from the exact solutions, while the energy predictions
remain more accurate.
We now move to the challenging case where all 16 LECs
at NNLO can vary. In the following we analyze two SPCC Hamiltonians based on Nsub = 64 and Nsub = 128
CCSD ground-state vectors, referred to as SP-CC(64)
and SP-CC(128), respectively. The ground-state vectors
are obtained at Nsub points in a domain of LEC values that surrounds the nominal LEC values of NNLOsat
within ±20% relative variation. This domain spans a
rather large interval of ground-state energies and charge
radii in 16 O. The three-nucleon contact-LEC cE ≈ 0.0395
in NNLOsat is small compared to the values of the remaining 15 LECs, we therefore scaled cE with a factor of
20. In accordance with observation, we also constrained
the leading-order isospin-breaking 1 S0 LECs (C̃) to exhibit small isospin-breaking. We draw Nsub values for α
~
using a space-filling latin hypercube design and solve for
the exact CCSD wavefunction at each point. We have
verified that the SP-CC(64) and SP-CC(128) Hamiltoni-

We use SP-CC(64) and global sensitivity analysis
(GSA) to analyze how the ab initio predictions for the
energy and charge radius in 16 O explicitly depend on the
LECs in the NNLO nuclear interaction. GSA is a very
powerful, although computationally demanding, method
for learning how much each unknown model parameter
contributes to the uncertainty in a model prediction [39].
As opposed to an uncertainty analysis, which addresses
the question of how uncertain the prediction itself is.
With SP-CC we can carry out the large amount of model
evaluations that is required to extract statistically significant GSA results. In the following, we treat the groundstate energy or radius of 16 O as an output Y = f (~
α) of a
model f , given here by the SP-CC(64) Hamiltonian and
its eigendecomposition. In the GSA we decompose the
total variance Var[Y ] as

Figure 2 shows the cross-validation with respect to
an additional set of 200 randomly drawn exact CCSD
calculations in the same 20% domain. From the crossvalidation we extract a root mean-squared error (RMSE)
of SP-CC(64): 4 MeV and 0.04 fm for the groundstate energy and charge radius, respectively. With SPCC(128) the RMSE values are 3 MeV and 0.02 fm.
Using more subspace vectors gives better predictions.
The present results are within the expected accuracy
of CCSD. The non-hermiticity of the CCSD equations
yields SP-CC Hamiltonians that do not obey a variational bound with respect to the exact CCSD calculations. From Fig. 2 we see that this is a minute effect.

and Var[Eα~ ∼(αi ) [Y |αi ]] denotes the variance of the conditional expectation of Y , and α
~ ∼ (αi ) denotes the set
of all LECs excluding αi , and correspondingly for the
second-order term. The variance integrals are evaluated
using quasi Monte Carlo (MC) sampling and we extract a
95% confidence interval of the final result via bootstrap
with 100 re-samples [40]. The first- and second-order
sensitivity indices are defined as
Si =

(6)

The first-order sensitivity, Si , is often referred to as
the main effect. It apportions the total variance in the
model output to an individual model parameter αi . The
higher-order indices, e.g. Sij , apportion the variance in
the model output to the combination of parameters αi
and αj . The number of higher-order indices grow exponentially with the number of parameters in the model.
Fortunately, it is possible to compute the sum of all sensitivity indices for each αi , i.e. ST i = Si +Sij +Sijk +. . ..
This is referred to as the total effect, and it quantifies the
total sensitivity of Var[Y ] to parameter αi including all
of its higher-order parameter combinations [41]. We always have that ST i ≥ Si , and equality for purely additive
models. In this analysis, we do not calibrate the model
to reproduce data. We study the behavior and response
of the model itself, and assume all LECs to be independent of each other and uniformly distributed. In future
studies one could draw LECs from a Bayesian posterior
distribution.

FIG. 3. (Color Online) (Left panel) Main and total effects (in %) for the ground-state energy (left bar) and charge radius (right
bar) in 16 O, grouped per LEC. The main and total effects were computed from (16 + 1) · 216 = 1, 114, 112 quasi MC evaluations
of the SP-CC(64) Hamiltonian. The vertical lines on each bar indicate bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. A larger
sensitivity value implies that the corresponding LEC is more critical for explaining the variance in the model output. (Right
panels) Histograms of the ground-state energy (top) and charge radius (bottom) from which total variances are decomposed.

Figure 3 shows the results from the GSA of the 16 O energy and radius using an SP-CC(64) chiral NNLO Hamiltonian. To limit the model response of the energy and
radius to a physically reasonable interval we only sample
a LEC domain corresponding to 10% variation around
the NNLOsat values. The LEC cE is still scaled with a
factor of 20. The MC sample size required for carrying
out a reliable GSA depends on: i) the complexity of the
model, and ii) the number of parameters in the model.
We have to use (16 + 1) · 216 = 1, 114, 112 quasi MC
samples to extract statistically significant main and total effects of the energy and radius for all LECs. With
SP-CC(64) this took about 1 hour on a standard laptop, while an equivalent set of exact CCSD computations would require 20 years. We find that 58(1)% of the
variance in the energy can be attributed to the leading
order LEC C̃3 S1 and all main and total effects are nearly
identical, which signals that the energy is nearly additive in all LECs. For the radius, the main effects are
distributed across several LECs and they differ from the
total effects. Indeed, second-order correlations between
the LECs are responsible for almost 14% of the variance
in the radius. This reflects part of the challenge of optimizing chiral NNLO Hamiltonians to reproduce radii of
atomic nuclei and consequently saturation properties of
nuclear matter. Our analysis also reveals that the energy
and radius of 16 O are not sensitive to the short-ranged
parts of the three-nucleon interaction in this domain. Of
the long-ranged πN LECs, c1,3,4 , only c4 exhibits a nonnegligible main-effect for the energy and radius. This
LEC contributes to the tensor force. As expected, only

P −wave LECs with large spin-weights contribute to the
O wavefunction. There also seems to be a larger sensitivity of the radius to the isospin- breaking terms in the
interaction. The GSA results guide future uncertainty reduction efforts for specific observables by identifying noninfluential LECs, which is also useful for e.g. calibration.
The SP-CC method will significantly leverage statistical
computation for analyzing correlations between different
observables in different nuclei across the Segré chart.

Summary and outlook.– We have developed the SP-CC
method for evaluating nuclear observables at different
values of the LECs in chiral Hamiltonians at unprecedented speed. With a modest number of subspace vectors, Nsub = 64, we reached 1% accuracy relative to exact CCSD solutions. From a GSA we conclude that the
variance of the ground-state energy in 16 O is additive in
all LECs of the NNLO chiral Hamiltonian, and that the
charge radius depends sensitively on the combination of
several LECs. The SP-CC method enables sophisticated
statistical computation [42–45] in ab initio nuclear theory
to reveal which new data would best reduce the uncertainty in Hamiltonian models and for understanding how
properties of atomic nuclei depend on the underlying interaction between protons and neutrons. The stability
of 16 O with respect to breakup into 4 He clusters is a
relevant example [35, 46–48]. The SP-CC method also
enables straightforward computation of derivatives with
respect to the LECs using e.g. algorithmic differentiation. SP-CC Hamiltonians occupy very little disk space,
and can easily be shared within the nuclear community.
