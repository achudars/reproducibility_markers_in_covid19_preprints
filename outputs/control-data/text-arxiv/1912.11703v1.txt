Abstract
We consider efficient estimation of flexible transformation models with interval-censored data. To
reduce the dimension of semi-parametric models, the unknown monotone transformation function
is approximated via monotone splines. A penalization technique is used to provide more computationally efficient estimation of all parameters. To accomplish model fitting, a computationally
efficient nested iterative expectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm is developed for estimation, and an easily implemented variance-covariance approach is proposed for inference on regression
parameters. Theoretically, we show that the estimator of the transformation function achieves the
optimal rate of convergence and the estimators of regression parameters are asymptotically normal
and efficient. The penalized procedure is assessed through extensive numerical experiments and
further illustrated via two real applications.

Introduction

The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a novel methodology to conduct regression analysis
for interval-censored data. Interval-censored data arise naturally in many epidemiological and
biomedical research in which the exact time to an event of interest cannot be measured directly,
but rather is known to lie within an interval. For example, in a retrospective breast cancer study
(Beadle et al., 1984), the rate of deterioration of the cosmetic result was compared between patients
with primary radiation therapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy and patients with radiotherapy alone.
Patients were scheduled every 4 to 6 months to inspect the cosmetic state at a clinic visit. The
information on time until one of endpoints, the appearance of breast retraction that is highly
associated with overall cosmetic deterioration, was only known between two adjacent clinic visits.

The regression analysis of interval-censored data has been extensively investigated in literature. In
particular, a lot of work has been focusing on the proportional hazards (PH) model, for example,
Finkelstein (1986), Satten (1996), Pan (1999), Betensky et al. (2002), Zhang et al. (2010), and
Wang et al. (2016), among many others. It is noted that the restrictive assumption of proportionality of hazards made in the above work is not always justifiable. To provide a more general
and flexible modeling framework, a lot of effort has been involved in the development of estimation
methodology under semi-parametric linear transformation models that include PH model as a special case, and can be classified as an estimating equation method (Zhang et al., 2005; Zhang and
Zhao, 2013), fully semiparametric maximum likelihood approach (Zeng et al., 2016), and monotone
spline technique (Zhou et al., 2017 and 2018); for a comprehensive review of analysis of intervalcensored data see Sun (2006), Zhang and Sun (2010), and the references therein.
The aforementioned methods under transformation models can be either computationally intensive
and unstable or complicated to implement. Thus in this work we strive to develop a flexible and computationally efficient penalized spline estimation approach that can be used to fit semi-parametric
transformation models with interval-censored data. In particular, we made use of monotone Bspline to model the unknown transformation function and utilized penalization methodology to
facilitate the spline estimation. To accomplish the model fitting, a nested iterative EM based
algorithm was developed for estimation, and a simple and consistent variance-covariance estimation approach was proposed to provide accurate and reliable inference for regression coefficients.
As demonstrated via extensive numerical studies, the proposed penalized approach is computationally efficient and robust to model misspecification under a variety of settings. Theoretically,
the large-sample properties such as the optimal rate of convergence of the functional estimator
and the asymptotic normality and efficiency of regression parameter estimators were established.
These appealing properties both numerically and theoretically emphasize the fact that the proposed
penalized procedure contributes to the existing methodology for interval-censored data.
The remainder of this paper is presented as follows. The methodological details of the penalized
approach including the development of a nested iterative EM based algorithm and the selection of
the smoothing parameter and spline knots are presented in Section 2. The large-sample properties
of penalized estimators and a consistent variance-covariance estimation approach are provided in
Section 3. The numerical performance of the penalized method is assessed via the extensive Monte
Carlo studies and compared with the existing approach (Wang et al. 2016) under the PH model
in Section 4. The proposed method is further illustrated by analyzing data from a retrospective
breast cancer study and a prospective signal tandmobiel study in Section 5. The summary of the
study and future work are discussed in Section 6. Finally, the proofs of the asymptotic results and
more simulation results are available in Supplementary Materials.

Model and numerical algorithm

2.1

Model and penalized likelihood

Consider a linear transformation model in which the conditional distribution of the true failure
time T given the covariate vector Z takes the form
g{F (t|Z)} = ϕ(t) + Z| β,

(1)

where β is a d-dimensional vector of regression coefficients corresponding to the covariate vector
Z. In this specification, it is assumed that the link function g(·) is a known and increasing function
on (0, 1) and the unknown transformation function ϕ(·) is smooth and monotone increasing on
(0, ∞) with ϕ(0) = −∞. The above formation provides immensely flexible modeling of censored
data and includes a group of commonly used models as special cases. For instance, model (1)
reduces to the proportional hazards (PH) model for specifying g(x) = log {− log(1 − x)}, while
taking g(x) = log {x/(1 − x)} leads to the proportional odds (PO) model.
In this work we are interested in fitting model (1) to interval-censored data. The fundamental
feature of interval-censored data is that the exact event time T cannot be ascertained, but rather is
censored by two observation times, say L and R with L < R. Let ∆i1 = I(T < L), ∆i2 = I(L < T <
R), and ∆i3 = I(T > R) denote the censoring indicators, subject to ∆1 + ∆2 + ∆3 = 1, where I(·)
is the indicator function. The event time T is left-, interval-, or right-censored if ∆1 = 1, ∆2 = 1, or
∆3 = 1, respectively. Consequently, the observed data comprise {∆i1 , ∆i2 , ∆i3 , Li , Ri , Zi }ni=1 . We
assume that the covariates are time-invariant and that the event time and the censoring process
are independent given the covariates. Under these assumptions, the log-likelihood of the observed
data for τ = (β, ϕ) is given by
`n (τ ) =

n
X

[∆i1 log{F (Ri |Zi )} + ∆i2 log {F (Ri |Zi ) − F (Li |Zi )} + ∆i3 log{1 − F (Li |Zi )}] .

Penalized estimation is well-known for its feature to control for the smoothness of nonparametric
estimator and to avoid overfitting the model; see Ma and Kosorok (2005) and Lu and Li (2017)
and the references therein. Proceeding in this manner, we make use of the following penalized
log-likelihood to estimate the parameters in model (1)

`n,λ = `n (τ ) − λ2 J 2 (ϕ),

R  (r)

where J 2 (ϕ) =
ϕ (t) dt for r > 0 is the penalized term and λ > 0 is the smoothing parameter
that is used to control for the smoothness of fitted function.
In general, it is an extremely challenging task to estimate the infinite-dimensional nonparametric
3

function directly from the penalized likelihood. Following the work of Lu and Li (2017), to tackle
the difficulty, we propose to approximate the unknown transformation function ϕ(·) via monotone
B-splines. In particular,
qn
X
ϕ(·) ≈ ϕn (·) =
γj Bj (·)
j=1

under the constraints γ1 ≤ . . . ≤ γqn , where Bj (·), j = 1, . . . , qn , are B-spline basis functions. The
nondecreasing coefficients γ = (γ1 , . . . , γqn )| guarantee that the resulting spline function ϕn (·) is
nondecreasing; see Theorem 5.9 of Schumaker (1981). Thus, via spline approximation, we obtain
the spline model
g{Fn (t|Z)} = ϕn (t) + Z| β.
(4)
Under the above spline model (4), the set of unknown parameters that have to be estimated is
given by θ = (β, γ). Moreover, to further relieve the computational burden, we approximate
the penalized term J 2 (ϕ) by the discrete difference penalty; see Eilers and Marx (1996). By
introduction of discrete penalty, the estimation can be easily fit via standard software. Under these
specifications, the observed penalized spline log-likelihood for θ is given by
lo,λ (θ) =

where k · k is the usual Euclidean norm and D is the matrix representation of the discrete difference
operator of order 2; see Wood (2017, p.168).

2.2

The EM algorithm

To accomplish model fitting, motivated by Wang et al. (2016), we developed a reliable and efficient EM based optimization procedure to identify the penalized estimator of θ. In particular, define Ni (t) as the latent Poisson process for subject i with mean rate function Hi (t) =


− log 1 − g−1 {ϕn (t) + Z|i β} , i = 1, . . . , n. Let Ti denote the time to the occurrence of the first
event of the Poisson process. Thus, Ti indeed follows the spline transformation model (4) with a
cumulative distribution function Fn (t|Zi ) = g−1 {ϕn (t) + Z|i β}. To implement the EM algorithm
for the proposed model, two latent variables need to be specified. In particular, let Yi = Ni (Ui1 ),
where Ui1 = ∆i1 Ri + (1 − ∆i1 )Li , and similarly, when ∆i1 = 0, define Wi = N(Ui2 ) − N(Ui1 ), where
Ui2 = ∆i2 Ri + ∆i3 Li . Under these specifications, if Ti is left-censored, then Yi > 0, and in the case
of interval-censoring or right-censoring, Yi = 0 and Wi > 0 or Yi = 0 and Wi = 0, respectively.
Observe that Yi ∼Poisson(λi1 ), and in the case of ∆i1 = 0, Wi ∼Poisson(λi2 ), where λi1 = Hi (Ui1 )
and λi2 = Hi (Ui2 ) − Hi (Ui1 ); see Wang et al. (2016) for further information. Thus, under these
specifications, ignoring the items without including θ, the complete penalized spline log-likelihood

4

for θ involving the latent Yi ’s and Wi ’s as well as observed data is given by
lc,λ (θ) =

n
X
i=1

{Yi log λi1 − λi1 + (∆i2 + ∆i3 )(Wi log λi2 − λi2 )} − λ2 kDγk2 .
2

During the E-step of the EM algorithm, conditional on the observed data Oi , i = 1, . . . , n, and the
current estimate θ (m) = (β (m) , γ (m) ) of θ, taking the expectation of lc,λ (θ) with respect to all the
latent variables Yi ’s and Wi ’s yields the penalized Q function, namely,

where E (m) (Yi ) ≡ E(Yi |Oi ; θ (m) ) and E (m) (Wi ) ≡ E(Wi |Oi ; θ (m) ). Under the specification of Yi ,
Yi > 0 if and only if ∆i1 = 1, and, given Oi and Yi > 0, Yi is a zero-truncated Poisson distribution.
Thus,

The M-step involves finding θ (m+1) = argmaxθ Qλ (θ, θ (m) ) under the constraints γ1 ≤ . . . ≤ γqn
for a fixed λ. The optimization can be easily accomplished via applying the standard linearly
constrained optimization routines such as R function constrOptim that is based on an adaptive
barrier algorithm.
Remark 1. By taking advantage of B-spline approximation, the proposed EM algorithm simplifies
the alternative of Wang et al. (2016) for the PH and PO models and extends it to the transformation
models.

2.3

Nested optimization procedure

In what follows, we summarize a nested iterative optimization procedure that involves in updating
estimates of both the parameters and the smoothing parameter. The outer process is committed to
streamlining the smoothing parameter λ, while the inner process is aimed at solving a constrained
penalized function for a fixed value λ, which can be achieved via applying an efficient EM algorithm as discussed in Section 2.2. At this point, we identify the maximizer of the penalized spline
(m)
log-likelihood function θbλ for a fixed λ. Once the inner process is finished, we implement the generalized Fellner-Schall method (Wood and Fasiello, 2017) to update the estimate of the smoothing

5

parameter in the outer process. In particular, the updated estimate of λ, say λ, is given by

where S−
λ is the generalized inverse of Sλ = λS with S = diag{0d×d , D D} and Jn,λ (θλ ) is
(m)
the generalized inverse of Jn,λ (θbλ ), the negative Hessian matrix of the observed penalized spline
(m)
log-likelihood function (5) evaluated at θλ = θbλ . Because Jn,λ (θλ ) is non-negative definite, the
numerator in (6) is guaranteed to be non-negative; see Theorem 4 of Wood and Fasiolo (2017)
for further information. Essentially, formula (6) is used to update the estimate of the smoothing
(m)
parameter each time after θbλ is available. Once the updated estimate of the smoothing parameter,
(m)
i.e., λ, is available, the inner process is then restarted to identify θbλ . These two processes iterate
(m)

(m)

in turn until convergence, i.e., the absolute difference between θλ and θλ is less than a prespecified number. The implementation of the nested iterative algorithm is outlined as follows:
(m)
Step 1 (outer process). Identify θbλ for the current λ through the EM algorithm discussed in
Section 2.2.

Step 2 (inner process). Update λ to λ via equation (6) and go back to Step 1 to identify θbλ .

cordingly, ϕ(·)

γ ) is the penalized spline estimator of ϕ(·).
It is noted that once the smoothing parameter is specified, the regression parameters and the
spline coefficients can be estimated simultaneously using the existing procedure. Moreover, as
demonstrated via the extensive simulation studies in Section 4, the proposed algorithm usually
converges in a few steps and is robust to the selection of the initial values and spline knots. Further,
the issue of divergence is very rare. These findings reinforce the assertion that the penalized spline
estimation approach is computationally stable and efficient.

2.4

Selection of knot

A sensitivity analysis displayed in Table 1 reveals that the proposed penalized procedure is robust


to the selection of knots. Thus, we choose the number of inner knots to be n1/3 denoting the
least integer greater than or equal to n1/3 . Once the number of knots is fixed, the location of knots
is determined by equally-spaced quantiles of the observation times. This empirical rule was applied
in the simulation study and the real application.

Let τ0 = (β0 , ϕ0 ) and τb = (β,

We establish the asymptotic properties of τb with L2 -norm

matrix for β at τ = τ0 is then defined as
I (β0 ) = E{`∗β (τ0 )}⊗2 ≡ E{`˙β (τ0 ) − `˙ϕ (τ0 )[h∗ ]}⊗2 ,
where `∗β (τ0 ) is the efficient score for β at τ = τ0 . The following regularity conditions are sufficient
to establish the asymptotic results.
(A1) The true regression parameter vector β0 is an interior point of a compact subset of Rd .
(A2) The true transformation function ϕ0 (·) is strictly increasing with 0 < 1/M < ϕ0 (d1 ) <
ϕ0 (d2 ) < M for some M > 0, where 0 < d1 < d2 < ∞ and its rth derivative satisfies
Lipschitz condition on [d1 , d2 ] with r ≥ 1.

states that the penalized estimator β achieves the information bound and, hence, is efficient; see
Bickel et al. (1993) for more discussion of semiparametric efficiency.
As discussed in Huang and Wellner (1997) and Zhang et al. (2010), the least favorable direction
h∗ is the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind and does not have a closed
form. Therefore, it is very challenging to estimate h∗ and, hence, the information matrix I (β0 )
directly. Following the proposal of Zhang et al. (2010), by taking advantage of the orthogonal
property of the least favorable direction and B-spline approximation, we put forward a least-square

b ∗ is
B-spline space for H. Following the arguments in Zhang et al. (2010), it can be shown that h
well-defined and can be used to consistently estimate h∗ . It follows that
b ∗ ]}⊗2
Ibn ≡ Pn {`˙β (b

that Ibn is the outer product version of the observed information for β without penalized term. Let
Ibn,λ denote the outer product version of the penalized observed information for β. The following
theorem results from the consistency of Ibn and the assumption of the smoothing parameter.
Theorem 3. (Variance estimation) Under conditions C1–C8, Ibn,λ is an asymptotically consistent
estimator of I (β0 ).

The finite-sample performance of the proposed variance-covariance estimation method was evaluated in the Monte Carlo study and employed for the inference on regression parameters in the real
application.

Simulation

In this section we assess the proposed methodology under a variety of simulation settings and
compare it with an existing approach (Wang et al. 2016) implemented in R package ICsurv. Assume
the true failure time was generated from a class of transformation models
gα {F (t|Z)} = ϕ(t) + Z1 β1 + Z2 β2 ,
where Z1 ∼ Bernoulli(0.5) and Z2 ∼ N (0, 1). To demonstrate the broad applicability of the
proposed approach, we assume that the link function belongs to a class of smooth and monotone
increasing functions indexed by a parameter α as follows:

−α
log (1 − u) − 1
α
gα (u) =

log{− log(1 − u)}

if α > 0,

(7)

if α = 0.

It is noted that the family of models presented above include the most commonly used survival
models, i.e., α = 0 or α = 1 corresponding to the PH or PO model, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology across a wide range of settings, we considered three simulation configurations that differ in the regression parameters β and the unknown
transformation function ϕ(·). In particular, in configuration I (C1), ϕ(t) = log{(t2 + t)/5} and
β = (−1, −1)| ; in configuration II (C2), ϕ(t) = log(t) and β = (−1, 1)| ; and in configuration III
(C3), ϕ(t) = log{log(1 + 3t) + t/3} and β = (1, −1)| . Under each configuration, three different
models were considered, i.e., α = 0 (PH), α = 0.5, and α = 1 (PO). To generate interval-censored
data, the number of observations for each individual was simulated from 1 plus a Poisson random
variable with expectation 1 for the purposes of avoiding zero observation, and the gap times between two consecutive observations follow an exponential distribution with mean parameter 0.5.
These specifications provide a diversity of right-censored rates, i.e., for α = 0, 0.5, and 1, the rightcensored rates are 74%, 76%, and 78%, respectively, under C1, 41%, 46%, and 51%, respectively,
under C2, and 14%, 21%, and 27%, respectively, under C3. For each considered configuration,
1,000 datasets were generated under each model with sample size n = 50 or n = 100. Cubic
B-splines with the knots being equally-spaced percentiles were employed to model the unknown
transformation function ϕ(·).
To demonstrate robust performance of the penalized method to the specification of the number of
knots, a sensitive analysis was conducted with the number of inner knots being selected to be 3,
9

5, and 7. Table 1 presents a summary of simulation results for the regression parameters (i.e., β1
and β2 ) under C1, across the three considered transformation models (i.e., α = 0, 0.5, and 1) and
two different sample sizes (i.e., n = 50 or 100). The summaries of simulation results for C2 and C3
are provided in the Web Tables 1a and 1b, respectively. One would observe that, under the three
considered simulation settings, the estimation and inference for β across all considered numbers of
knots are almost the same, suggesting the robustness of the penalized spline method to the selection
of the number of knots. Therefore, it is suitable in our simulation study and real application to
choose the number of inner knots to be n1/3 . These results reveal that the penalized approach
exhibits desirable numerical properties across all considered settings. In particular, the empirical
biases are small and approach to 0 as the sample size increases, providing numerical assertion
of asymptotic consistency. Moreover, the standard deviations (SD) of the point estimates are in
accordance with the averages of the estimated standard errors (ASE) derived from the proposed
variance-covariance estimation method, and the corresponding empirical coverage probabilities of
95% Wald-type confidence intervals are close to the nominal level. These findings give an impression
that the large-sample inference based on the proposed variance-covariance estimation procedure is
feasible under all considered models, even with a relatively small sample size. At last, the power
of the Wald-type test for the regression parameters based on the proposed variance-covariance
estimation procedure was examined. On the basis of the change of power for β under C1 of the PO
model displayed in Figure 1, it suggests that the proposed procedure can be employed to accurately
estimate the power of Wald-type test, i.e., the estimated powers display the symmetry around true
values and increase when the sample size or effect size is increased.
We compared the proposed methodology with the competing I-spline based sieve semi-parametric
approach outlined in Wang et al. (2016) under the PH model. There are many reasons to choose
this approach for a direct comparison. In particular, this competing method is the most recent
contribution to the existing methodology for interval-censored data and was implemented in R
package ICsurv. For purposes of comparison, cubic splines are used for both the penalized spline
and the I-spline methods. For a particular data set, as discussed above, the penalized approach
selects the number of knots as a cubic root of sample size. In contrast, the competing method
makes use of varying configurations of the number of knots. The I-spline based sieve estimator is
identified via some model selection criteria such as the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC); see
Wang et al. (2016) for more details. Table 2 summarizes the result of comparison for estimations of
the regression parameters under C1. The results of comparisons under C2 and C3 are provided in
Web Tables 2a and 2b, respectively. From this summary, the proposed penalized estimation method
exhibits smaller mean squared errors and better empirical coverage probabilities when compared
with the competing approach. Further, the standard error estimates obtained from the proposed
variance-covariance estimation procedure display less variability when compared to the ones based
on the Louis’s method implemented in R package ICsurv. It was found that the competing Ispline approach suffers from the issue of algorithm divergence and the negative variance estimate,
especially when the number of knots is large or the right censoring rate is high. Therefore, it is

10

evident that the proposed methodology outperforms the approach of Wang et al. (2016) under the
PH model across all considered settings even through the competing sieve estimator was selected
as the best from multiple knot configurations.
The results with respect to the estimation of the transformation function ϕ(·) under C1 of the
PH (i.e., α = 0) and the PO (i.e., α = 1) models for all considered sample sizes are summarized
in Figure 2. Included in the figure are pointwise means and the corresponding 2.5% and 97.5%
percentiles of the 1,000 estimates, together with the true value of the function. Web Figures 2a
and 2b exhibit similar results under C2 and C3, respectively. It is observed that the spline curve
fits the true function very well and the pointwise lower and upper limits of 95% confidence interval
are fairly close, indicating negligible bias and little variability of the spline estimates. Further,
both bias and variability decrease with sample size, which provides a numerical verification to the
asymptotic consistency established in Section 3.
Finally, we investigated the robustness of the proposed methodology in the case where the assumption of PH or PO is not valid, i.e., select the PH model (α = 0) for α = 0.2 and PO model
(α = 1) for α = 0.8 under C1. As displayed in Table 3, the proposed methodology still exhibits the
satisfactory finite-sample performance in terms of bias, standard deviation, average of estimated
standard errors, and coverage probability, i.e., the approach is robust to the specification of the link
function to a certain extent. The analogous results under C2 and C3 are available in Web Tables
3a and 3b, respectively. In summary, the proposed penalized method displays desirable numerical
properties such as accurate estimation and reliable inference even for a small sample size under a
variety of simulation settings and models for interval-censored data.

Real data application
Breast cosmesis study

For purposes of illustration, we applied the proposed methodology to a breast cosmesis study
(Beadle et al., 1984). The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the effect of adjuvant
chemotherapy on cosmetic state for early breast cancer patients who received primary radiation
therapy. Two treatment regimens were assigned, i.e., 48 patients were assigned to the radiation
therapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy, and 46 to the radiation therapy alone. Each patient was
scheduled to visit the clinic every 4 to 6 months to check overall cosmetic appearance. For this
analysis, the event of interest is the appearance of breast retraction which is highly correlated
to overall cosmetic deterioration. It is noted that the exact time until the appearance of breast
retraction cannot be observed attribute to the design of the study. It was only known that the event
time occurred within an interval, i.e., it is interval-censored. Further, as discussed in Finkelstein
and Wolfe (1985), the time between clinic visits was unlikely to be related to the development of
11

cosmetic deterioration, i.e., the non-informative censorship assumption was appropriate for analysis
of this data set.
For this analysis, we were interested in comparing the rate of cosmetic deterioration between two
treatments. Cubic B-spline with dn1/3 e = 5 inner knots placed at equally-spaced percentiles of
follow-up time was utilized to model the transformation function. The nested algorithm outlined in
Section 2.2 was employed for model fitting, and the proposed variance-covariance estimation method
discussed in Section 3 was applied to estimate the standard errors of the regression parameter
estimators. Table 4 summarizes the result including the regression parameter estimates and the
estimated standard errors along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals under the PH and
the PO models. Both models suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy is a significant risk factor for
cosmetic deterioration. In particular, patients who received chemotherapy in addition to primary
radiation treatment demonstrated a higher hazard of developing breast retraction when compared
to those who received primary radiation therapy alone under the PH model. The similar result
is observed for the PO model, i.e., the chemotherapy increases the odds of breast retraction for
those who have previously received the primary radiation therapy. These results support the
findings provided in Finkelstein and Wolfe (1985), Finkelstein (1986), and Zhang et al. (2010).
The estimated transformation functions along with 95% pointwise confidence intervals under the
PH and the PO models are displayed in Figure 3. The lower and upper limits of 95% pointwise
confidence intervals were calculated as 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of 1,000 pointwise bootstrap
estimates, respectively.

5.2

Signal tandmobiel study

To further illustrate the proposed approach, we analyzed data from signal tandmobiel study that
is a longitudinal prospective dental study conducted in Northern Belgium from 1996 to 2001. In
this study, a total of 4,468 randomly selected children (2,315 boys and 2,153 girls) who were born
in 1989 were examined annually (at most 6 times) by one of the 16 trained dentists. At each clinic
visit, the information on the emergence of permanent tooth (i.e., “emerged” versus “not emerged”)
was recorded. In addition, the health status of each erupted tooth was inspected and made into
two categories: “sound” versus “caries experience” (i.e., presence of caries, filled, or extracted for
reasons of caries). Because the participants were examined on an annual basis, caries experience
data were interval-censored. It is noted that clinical visits were scheduled independently of the time
of caries experience, i.e., it is reasonable to assume the non-informative censoring for this study. For
this analysis, we aimed to detect the association between caries experience and three potential risk
factors, i.e., gender, type of education system (free school, community school, or province/council
school), and the starting age of brushing the teeth. In particular, we are interested in the 4 first
molar teeth, whose right-censoring rates are around 25%. In our analysis, we analyzed the health
status of one of the maxillary first molar teeth (i.e., tooth 26); see p. 29 of Bogaerts et al. (2017)

12

for more information of tooth identification number) by using the following model
g{F (t|Z)} = ϕ(t) + β1 Z1 + β2 Z2 + β3 Z3 + β4 Z4 ,
where g(·) is a known link function. In the above specifications, Z1 = 1 for boy and Z1 = 0
for girl, Z2 = 1 if the child attended community school (Z2 = 0 otherwise), Z3 = 1 if the child
attended province/council school (Z3 = 0 otherwise), and Z4 indicates the starting age of brushing
the teeth (as reported by parents), i.e., the nearest integer that is greater than the true age.
The unknown transformation function ϕ(·) was approximated by cubic B-splines. The selection
of knots and smoothing parameter follows the discussion outlined in Section 2.2. Model fitting
was accomplished through the nested algorithm summarized in Section 2.2, and the inference on
the regression parameters was based on the proposed variance-covariance approach summarized
in Section 3. Presented in Table 5 are regression parameter estimates and estimated standard
errors along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals under the PH and the PO models. Both
models suggest that starting to brush the teeth at a later age is a significant risk factor for caries
experience, while gender and school attendance are not. In particular, participants who started
brushing the teeth at a later age experienced a significant earlier caries for an erupted tooth.
Further, the estimates of the transformation function under the PH and the PO models along with
95% pointwise confidence intervals are shown in Figure 4. The lower and upper limits of the 95%
pointwise confidence intervals are determined by 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of 1,000 bootstrap
estimates.

Summary and discussion

In this work a computationally efficient penalized approach has been developed to analyze intervalcensored data under flexible semi-parametric linear transformation models. The proposed nested
iterative algorithm is straightforward to implement via existing software. The proposed penalized
estimation method exhibits desirable numerical properties that are validated through the extensive
Monte Carlo studies. Further, a simple and consistent variance-covariance estimation approach
was developed to provide reliable inference for regression parameters. In addition to the appealing
numerical properties, the nonparametric estimator achieves the optimal rate of convergence, and
the regression parameter estimators are shown to be asymptotically normal and efficient.
Inspired by the attainment of the proposed penalized approach, future work will be targeted at
extending the proposed methodology to a partially linear additive transformation model for intervalcensored data and a linear transformation model for heavily right-censored interval-censored data.
Another desirable direction for future research could involve the development of an approach to
identifying the link function. One option is to apply the single-index methodology to transformation models, i.e., treat the monotone link function as unknown and model it via penalized monotone
13

splines. Proceeding in this way allows us to fully capture the nonparametric feature of the link
function. Due to the complex nature of interval-censored data and single-index model this is an
extremely challenging topic. A lot of effort would be involved in the discussion of the identifiability of the model and the development of numerical algorithm and large-sample properties of the
penalized estimators.

Notations

Let P and P0 be the distribution of X for τ and τ0 , respectively, with respect to a σ-finite measure
µ, and pτ and p0 be the corresponding densities. The empirical process evaluated at a measurable
√
function f is defined as Gn f ≡ n(Pn − P )f , where Pn f is the expectation of f under the empirical
measure Pn . Accordingly, define kGn kF ≡ supf ∈F |Gn f | for a class of measurable functions F .
Let N (δ, F , Lq (P ) and N[] (δ, F , Lq (P )) denote the covering number and the bracketing number
with F for Lq (P )-metric with q ≥ 1 (Lq (P ) reduces to the supremum norm k · k∞ for q = ∞).
In the sequel, the expressions a . b and a & b represent a ≤ b and a ≥ b, respectively, up to a
constant. We apply Theorem 25.81 of van der Vaart (2000) to derive the consistency and the rate
of convergence of τb. Define the criterion function in above theorem as

mτ ,λ = mτ − λ2 J 2 (ϕ) − J 2 (ϕ0 ) ,

where mτ = log{(pτ + p0 )/(2p0 )}.

Proof of Lemma 1

Let `τ = log pτ and `0 = log pτ0 . The density function p0 is bounded away from a sufficiently
small constant η > 0 and infinite and, hence, pτ is also bounded away form a positive constant and
infinite, for τ varying in a small neighborhood of τ0 . It follows that `τ and `0 are bounded. Then,

where ξ1 (Z) = Z| (β − β0 ) and ξ2 (t) = ϕ(t) − ϕ0 (t). The last inequality holds because the first
derivative of the link function g(·) is bounded away from 0 and infinite. Invoke the law of total
expectation and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and then apply the orthogonal property of conditional
expectation to conclude that there exists 0 < C0 < 1 such that {Eξ1 (Z)ξ2 (L)}2 ≤ C0 Eξ12 (Z)Eξ22 (L).
It concludes from Lemma 25.86 of van der Vaart (2000) that
E{ξ1 (Z) + ξ2 (L)}2 & Eξ12 (Z) + Eξ22 (L).
The above inequality also holds for E{ξ1 (Z) + ξ(R))}2 by replacing L by R. Lemma 1 follows.

Write p(t) = a| t for t = (1, t, . . . , tr−1 )| and a = (a0 , a1 . . . , ar−1 )| with al = ϕ(l) (d1 )/l!, for

The non-singularity of matrix E(tt| ) implies that kak2 /{1 + J(ϕ)} ≤ O(1) and, hence, kpk∞ /{1 +
J(ϕ)} ≤ O(1) because p(·) is defined on a bounded set. The Lemma follows from the inequality
kϕk∞ ≤ kpk∞ + khk∞ .

7.5

Proof of Lemma 3

As shown in Lemma 2, for any J(ϕ) < ∞, ϕ(·) can be written as p(·) + h(·), where p(·) is a
polynomial of degree r − 1 and h satisfies khk∞ ≤ J(ϕ) and J(h) = J(ϕ). Let G be a class of
functions with khk∞ ≤ η and J(h) ≤ η. According to Lemma 2.4 of van der Geer (2000), the
entropy number log N (ε, G , k · k∞ ) is of the order (η/ε)1/r . For a fixed function h(·), because g−1 (·)
is one-to-one, by Example 3.7.4d of van der Geer (2000) and Lemma 9.7 of Kosorok (2008), the class
of bounded functions g−1 {Z| β + p(t) + h(t)} is a Vapnik-Chervonenkis subgraph class of indexes
bounded by d + r + 2. Lemma 19.15 of van der Vaart (2000) applies and concludes that the uniform
covering number of the above class for L2 -norm is of order (1/ε)2(d+r+1) . Because J(ϕ) ≤ η implies
khk∞ ≤ η and J(h) ≤ η, it follows that the uniform covering number of the class of functions
g−1 {Z| β + ϕ(t)} with J(ϕ) ≤ η is of order (1/ε)2(r+d+1) exp{(η/ε)1/r } and, hence,

Because pτ is essentially a transformation of g−1 (ζ1 ) and g−1 (ζ2 ) for ζ1 = Z| β + ϕ(L) and ζ2 =

Lemma 3 follows by applying the similar arguments in the proof of Lemma 9.13 of Kosorok (2008).

7.6

Proof of Lemma 4

Combing (B1)–(B3) yields
Pn `∗β (τ0 ) = I (β0 )(βb − β0 ) + op (n−1/2 ).
The lemma follows from the non-singularity of I (β0 ) and the standard central limit theorem.

Proof of rate of convergence

Because the logarithmic function is concave, by definition of τb, we have Pn mτb,λ ≥ 0 = Pn mτ0 ,λ .

Further, p0 and pτ are bounded below by positive numbers; see proof of Lemma 1. It follows that

the right-handed term in the above inequality can be bounded by − (pτ −p0 )2 dµ, up to a constant.
We conclude from Lemma 1 that
P0 (mτ ,λ − mτ0 ,λ ) . −kτ − τ0 k22 − λ2 J 2 (ϕ) + λ2 .
Hence, condition (25.79) of Theorem 25.81 of van der Vaart (2000) holds with d2λ (τ , τ0 ) = kτ −
τ0 k22 + λ2 J 2 (ϕ). According to the assumption of λ, dλ (τ , τ0 ) ≤ η implies kβ − β0 k ≤ η and
J(ϕ) ≤ η/λn for λn = n−r/(1+2r) . Define F η = {mτ , kβ − β0 k ≤ η, J(ϕ) ≤ η/λn }. In view of

We conclude from Theorem 2.14.1 of van der Vaart and Wellner (1996) that condition (25.80)

Proof of asymptotic normality and efficiency

Inserting (βb + ν, ϕ

differentiating it at ν = 0, we obtain the stationary equations

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and J(ϕ)
b = Op (1) along with the assumption of λ apply and yield
that condition (B1) holds. As shown in the proof of Theorem 1, the class of functions Z| β + ϕ(t)
with kβ − β0 k ≤ η, J(ϕ) ≤ η, and kϕk∞ ≤ η for η > 0 is a Donsker class. Further, the efficient
function `∗β (τ ) is Lipschitz with respect to (ζ1 , ζ2 ). We conclude from the Donsker preservation
theorem (Theorem 2.10.6 of van der Vaart and Wellner 1996) that the class of functions `∗β (τ ) with
τ ) is
kβ − β0 k ≤ η, J(ϕ) ≤ η, and kϕk∞ ≤ η for η > 0 is a Donsker class. By Theorem 1, `∗β (b

τ ) − `∗β (τ0 )k2 → 0. It follows from Theorem 19.24 of van der Vaart (2000) that condition

(B2) holds. Finally, in view of the fact that P {`∗β (τ )`˙ϕ (τ )[h]} = 0 for any h(·) with J(h) < ∞ and
the rate of convergence of τb, a Taylor expansion applies and yields that
P {`∗β (b
τ ) − `∗β (τ0 )} = −I (β0 )(βb − β0 ) + op (n−1/2 ).
We conclude the asymptotic normality and the efficiency of βb from Lemma 4.
