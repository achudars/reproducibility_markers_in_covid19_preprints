One possible explanation for the proton form factor discrepancy is a contribution to the elastic
electron-proton cross section from hard two-photon exchange (TPE), a typically neglected radiative
correction. Hard TPE cannot be calculated in a model-independent way, but it can be determined
experimentally by looking for deviations from unity in the ratio of positron-proton to electronproton cross sections. Three recent experiments have measured this cross section ratio to quantify
hard TPE. To interpret the results of these experiments, it is germane to ask: ‚ÄúHow large of a
deviation from unity is necessary to fully resolve the form factor discrepancy?‚Äù With a minimal set
of assumptions and using global fits to unpolarized and polarized elastic scattering data, I estimate
the necessary size of the two-photon exchange correction in the kinematics of the three recent
experiments and compare to their measurements. I find wide variation when using different global
fits, implying that the magnitude of the form factor discrepancy is not well-constrained. The recent
hard TPE measurements can easily accommodate the hypothesis that TPE underlies the proton
form factor discrepancy.

INTRODUCTION

There is a considerable discrepancy between unpolarized Rosenbluth measurements and polarized measurements of the proton‚Äôs electromagnetic form factor ratio, RF F ‚â° ¬µp GE /GM . Hard two-photon exchange
(TPE), a previously neglected radiative effect, has been
suggested as a possible explanation for the discrepancy
[1, 2]. While the effect of hard TPE cannot be calculated in a model-independent way, it can be determined
experimentally, by measuring the deviation from unity
in R2Œ≥ ‚â° œÉe+ p /œÉe‚àí p , the ratio of the positron-proton
to electron-proton elastic cross sections. Three recent
experiments measured R2Œ≥ over a range of squared 4momentum transfer, Q2 , up to 2 GeV2 [3‚Äì5] (working in
units where the speed of light, c = 1), but the results
showed only modest hard TPE, leaving open the question whether or not hard TPE is in fact the cause of the
proton form factor discrepancy. See Ref. [6] for a recent
review.
To interpret the results of these new experiments, it
is helpful to ask the question: ‚ÄúHow much two-photon
exchange is needed to resolve the proton form factor discrepancy?‚Äù This question doesn‚Äôt have a precise answer.
One challenge is estimating the size of the discrepancy
itself. There have been dozens of experimental determinations of RF F at many different values of Q2 and
these results must be combined, averaged, and interpolated. Fortunately, there have been several global fits
to both polarized and unpolarized form factor data, and
while they may differ slightly in methodology or included
data, they can provide a parameterization for RF F as
determined by the two different techniques. A second
challenge is that the exact kinematic dependence of the
hard TPE effect is unknown. There is not a unique way

to translate from the size of the discrepancy at a given
value of Q2 to the necessary value of R2Œ≥ as a function
of both Q2 and , the virtual photon polarization parameter. Many model-dependent calculations of TPE have
been made (see, for example, Refs. [7‚Äì9], and others),
and these provide a valuable guide for interpreting experimental results. However, rather than adopt any model
or calculation framework, I propose a method of estimating the TPE contribution necessary to resolve the form
factor discrepancy from form factor data alone, relying
on three reasonable assumptions:
1. Polarized measurements accurately determine
RF F , i.e., they are unaffected by hard TPE. This
is the general consensus of the community [1, 6, 10,
11].
2. Hard TPE makes no contribution to the elastic
cross section in the limit  ‚Üí 1. This is supported
by the majority of theoretical calculations of hard
TPE (see Refs [7‚Äì9] as examples, as well as the
discussion in [12]).
3. Hard TPE preserves the linearity of Rosenbluth
plots. This may not be true, especially at extreme
kinematics, but is very-well supported by previous unpolarized data (and thoroughly studied in
Ref. [13]).
These three assumptions, combined with global fits to
unpolarized measurements of GE , unpolarized measurements of GM , and polarized measurements of RF F are
sufficient to define the value of R2Œ≥ that would fully explain the form factor discrepancy.
In this paper I use three different global fits to unpolarized measurements to make predictions of the hard
TPE effect necessary to resolve the form factor discrepancy. I compare these predictions to the results of the

2
recent TPE experiments, at VEPP-3 [3], at CLAS [4, 14],
and the OLYMPUS Experiment [5]. I find that in the
Q2 range relevant for these experiments (up to 2 GeV2 ),
the spread in predictions from using different global fits
is very large, indicating that the size of the form factor discrepancy is not well constrained. The recent TPE
measurements fall within the spread of predictions, indicating consistency with the hypothesis that TPE is the
origin of the form factor discrepancy.
DERIVATION

To preserve the linearity of Rosenbluth plots, hard
TPE must correct the reduced cross section in a way
that satisfies:


G2M (Q2 )+ G2E (Q2 )‚àíŒ¥(Q2 )(1‚àí) = GÃÉ2M (Q2 )+ GÃÉ2E (Q2 ),
œÑ

where GE and GM represent the true form factors, GÃÉE
and GÃÉM represent the form factors extracted from unpolarized Rosenbluth separation without accounting for
hard TPE, œÑ ‚â° Q2 /4m2p , where mp is the proton mass,
and Œ¥(Q2 ) represents a lepton charge-odd modification
due to hard TPE. Given the  dependence of both sides
of equation 1, two relationships must hold at every value
of Q2 :
G2E = GÃÉ2E ‚àí œÑ Œ¥

Dividing the two, one finds that
RF2 F =

which can be solved for Œ¥:

GLOBAL FIT MODELS

For this method, suitable global fits of GÃÉE and GÃÉM
must consider only unpolarized cross section measurements and not include any hard TPE corrections, either
on the cross sections or in the fit parameterization. Many
well known proton form factor parameterizations (e.g.
Refs. [23‚Äì25]) are therefore not suitable. I consider three
suitable fits to exclusively unpolarized elastic electronproton cross sections:
‚Ä¢ Bosted (1995) [26],
‚Ä¢ Arrington (2004), unpolarized [12],
‚Ä¢ Bernauer et al. (2013), unpolarized [21].
These fits differ in their parameterization, but more significantly in the input data that are considered. Bosted
fits a representative sample of elastic scattering data,
which are described in Ref. [27]. The Arrington fit, whose
procedure is described in Ref. [28], includes newer highQ2 data from Jefferson Lab [29‚Äì31], as well as additional
low-Q2 data from Mainz [32, 33] and Saskatchewan [34].
The Bernauer et al. fit includes the 2010 Mainz measurements [35], comprising approximately 1400 new data
points up to Q2 = 1 GeV2 , in addition to previous world
data at larger Q2 . For comparison with these global fits,
I also consider the standard dipole parameterization.

By using global fits to unpolarized data to supply GÃÉE and
GÃÉM and a global fit to polarized data to supply RF F ,
an estimate of the value of R2Œ≥ needed to resolve the
discrepancy can be made:
R2Œ≥ = 1 +

to extract TPE from several Rosenbluth separation data
sets. In this work, I use global fit models of GÃÉE and GÃÉM
to estimate the size of the TPE correction to resolve the
discrepancy for the kinematics of the three recent R2Œ≥
measurements.

This approach of estimating R2Œ≥ from the size of the
form factor discrepancy has been employed by many others in the past starting from a range of assumptions and
using a variety of assumed functional forms [1, 12, 15‚Äì22].
In Ref. [18], Borisyuk and Kobushkin derived an expression that is mathematically equivalent to that of Eq. 6
though using a slightly different set of assumptions. In
Ref. [20], Qattan et al. employ the expression of Ref. [18]

A suitable global fit for RF F should consider only polarization measurements, without any incorporation of
TPE-corrected unpolarized cross section measurements.
This type of fit has not yet been of significant interest
so no extremely sophisticated fits of this kind have been
published. Gayou et al. perform a linear fit in the range
of 0.5 < Q2 < 5.6 GeV2 [36]. For this paper, I will
also use a linear model that is consistent with the world
polarization data:
‚Ä¢ RF F (Q2 ) = 1 ‚àí (0.12 GeV‚àí2 )Q2 .
Bernauer et al. conveniently report uncertainty estimates on GÃÉE , GÃÉM , and their ratio, allowing me to make
an uncertainty estimate on the extracted R2Œ≥ . My estimate is approximate; the uncertainties on GÃÉE and GÃÉM
are correlated, and these correlations are not reported.
Except at very low Q2 however, the uncertainty on GÃÉE

3
is dominant. Therefore, my uncertainty estimates on R2Œ≥
extracted using the Bernauer et al. fits are based on the
uncertainty on GÃÉE only. I am further neglecting any
contribution to the uncertainty from my linear model
of RF F , making my uncertainty estimates an underestimate. It should be noted that, since the Bosted and
Arrington fits are based on fewer data than the Bernauer
fits, one would expect them to have uncertainties that
are at least as large as those of Bernauer et al., and significantly larger for Q2 < 1 GeV2 .

corrections are necessary to make the measured reduced
cross sections linear in  for fixed Q2 . However, without
redoing the fits, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of
the effect on GE /GM ‚Äîsince these corrections are nonlinear in , the effect depends on the  coverage of the
input cross section data. Therefore, I make no attempting to correct the Bernauer et al. extractions of the form
factors to unify approaches with Arrington and Bosted.
I use the global fits as published and the results should
be interpreted with this caveat in mind.
The choice of radiative correction prescriptions also affects the interpretation of measurements of R2Œ≥ , since, for
example, Maximon and Tjon use a different definition of
soft TPE than do Mo and Tsai. The R2Œ≥ data shown in
this work all use the Mo and Tsai definition (OLYMPUS
has published results for multiple prescriptions [5]).

Fig. 1 shows RF F as predicted by the three unpolarized
global fits as a function of Q2 , as well as the Q2 coverage
of the three recent TPE experiments. The proton form
factor discrepancy is essentially the deviation between
the unpolarized and polarized predictions of RF F . The
size of the discrepancy varies considerably between the
different unpolarized fits.
One remark must be made regarding the consistency of
radiative corrections. Bosted, Arrington, and Bernauer
et al. make explicit efforts to make sure that consistent
radiative corrections were re-applied to all input cross
sections before fitting. However, they chose to apply
different correction prescriptions. Bosted and Arrington follow a prescription based on Mo and Tsai [37],
with some improvements detailed in the appendices of
Ref. [27]. By contrast, Bernauer et al. adopted the prescription by Maximon and Tjon [38] and further exponentiated the correction to account for radiation at all
orders. In addition, Bernauer et al., also chose to apply
a Feshbach correction for Coulomb distortion. The exact
choice of radiative corrections prescription may seem like
a small technical detail, but it will alter the form factors
obtained from a fit (see, for example, Ref. [25]). The
choice of prescription amounts to an assertion of what

the measured data fall within or slightly above the uncertainty band using the Bernauer fits, but below the

energies show an increasing R2Œ≥ with decreasing , which

magnitude of this increase falls between the prediction of

FIG. 3. The results from the CLAS TPE experiment [14] for
Q2 = 0.85 GeV2 (top panel) and Q2 = 1.45 GeV2 also fall below the prediction produced using the Bosted and Arrington
fits, but above that coming from the Bernauer fit.

There are two general trends that can be seen in
Figs. 2, 3, and 4. First, the prediction based on the
Bernauer fits is significantly different from those based
on Bosted, Arrington, and the standard dipole, even
given the uncertainty estimate. The inclusion of the 2010
Mainz data set has a large effect on the apparent size of
the form factor discrepancy. Looking at Fig. 1, Bernauer
shows no discrepancy up to Q2 ‚âà 1.3 GeV2 . The RF F
difference between the Bernauer fits and the others are

5
driven largely by the differences in GM at low Q2 . This
suggests that as long as there is a lack of consensus on
GM , there will be uncertainty on how big the proton form
factor discrepancy actually is, and on how much TPE is
needed to resolve it. More unpolarized cross section data,
especially at low Q2 and backward angles, would provide
valuable constraints on GM . New results, such as those
from the PRad Experiment [39] will at least allow updated global form factor fits that may help solidify the
situation.
Second, the recent TPE data fall below the predictions
using the Bosted and Arrington fits, but above the prediction using the Bernauer fits. If the Bosted and Arrington form factor fits are to be believed, the data do not
support the hypothesis that TPE is the sole cause of the
form factor discrepancy. Judging by the Bernauer fit prediction, there is adequate TPE. The data so far cannot
make any definitive claims, and can easily accommodate
the TPE hypothesis. As is clear from Fig. 1, higher Q2
data are needed for a more definitive test.
Given both the spread in predictions based on different form factor fits, and the large uncertainties indicated
by the Bernauer fits, it is clear that a proper and comprehensive uncertainty analysis is needed. Such an analysis must take into account the correlations between fit
parameters, the correlations they introduce between GE
and GM , and the resulting uncertainty on R2Œ≥ .
As new elastic electron-proton scattering data become
available, the technique I describe can be used to improve
our understanding of the proton form factor discrepancy
and the amount of hard TPE needed to resolve it. This
can provide valuable context for the interpretation of upcoming experiments, such as MUSE [40], and those being
considered at DESY and Mainz.
