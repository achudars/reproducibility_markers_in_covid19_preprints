The “Monkey Typing Shakespeare” Problem for Compositions
Shalosh B. EKHAD and Doron ZEILBERGER
Pattern Avoidance

arXiv:1901.04069v1 [math.CO] 13 Jan 2019

The theme of pattern-avoidance, i.e. the question
‘How Many objects of such and such kind avoid such and such patterns?’
is everywhere dense in combinatorics. Often the problems are so hard that the mere existence is
highly non-trivial, for example in Ramsey theory and Roth and Szemerédi’s theorems.
[We understand the word ‘pattern’ in a general sense, the notion of ‘permutation pattern’ ([Wi],[HM]) is only one
case.]

One of the simplest such problems is when the objects are words in a fixed finite alphabet (say
our very own A-Z, consisting of 26 letters) and the pattern to avoid is a fixed consecutive subword
(say the collected works of the Bard arranged in lexicographic order of titles, ignoring spaces and
punctuation marks). It is easy to see that the probability that a monkey typing n letters randomly
will avoid a run of the (long but finite) string consisting of Willie’s opus is less than αn for some
fixed constant α strictly less than 1, hence if the monkey lives long enough he will sooner or later
succeed. Of course it is latttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttter rather than sooner, but we mathematicians
pretend that we, and our monkeys, are immortal.
The problem of finding the exact probability of a random word in a fixed (finite) alphabet avoiding a pre-determined string (or set of strings) as consecutive subwords (or equivalently counting
the number of such words) is handled by the Goulden-Jackson Cluster Method [GJ], beautifully
exposited, and extended, in [NZ].
Another, much harder, example of the notion of pattern-avoidance is the one used in the very active
field of permutation patterns [Wi], that has been beautifully extended to compositions and words
in Silvia Heurbach and Toufik Mansour’s magnum opus [MH].
This article
In this article we will also talk about compositions, but the notion of pattern is different. If we
define a pattern just as the literal occurrence of a consecutive subword, then we get a straightforward
generalization of the Goulden-Jackson set-up ([GJ] [NZ]). In this article, we fill a much needed gap
(Oops, we meant ‘fill a gap that was in great need of being filled’) and describe an algorithm,
fully implemented in Maple, to enumerate the problem of avoiding (consecutive) containment of
compositions, in a sense to be explained shortly.
The algorithm is fully implemented in the Maple package Compositions.txt, written by the secondnamed author, available from the url

,

where one can also find extensive sample output files, created by the first-named author.
First we must recall the definition of composition and then what we mean by a composition avoiding
another composition by containment.
Compositions
Recall that a composition of a non-negative integer n is an ordered list a1 a2 . . . ak of positive
integers that add-up to n.
For example, the set of compositions of 4 is

{4, 13, 31, 22, 112, 121, 211, 1111}

.

The number of compositions of n is famously 2n−1 for n > 0 and 1 for n = 0. A quick way to
see it is by assigning the composition a1 a2 . . . ak to the subset of {1, ..., n − 1} given by {a1 , a1 +
a2 , . . . , a1 + . . . + ak−1 }. This is a bijection. Another way to prove this trivial fact is via generating
P∞
x
. The generating function of
functions. The generating function of a single entry is i=1 xi = x−1
x k
compositions into exactly k parts is, by ‘independence’, ( x−1 ) , hence the generating function of
P
x k
x
1−x
x
all compositions is ∞
k=0 ( x−1 ) = 1/(1 − x−1 ) = 1−2x = 1 + 1−2x .
When does a composition include another composition?
Definition: The composition a1 . . . ak includes the composition b1 . . . bs if k ≥ s and there exists
an i, 1 ≤ i ≤ k − s + 1 such that
b1 ≤ a i

,

b2 ≤ ai+1

,

...

,

bs ≤ ai+s−1

.

For example, the composition 222 includes all the members of the set of compositions {1, 2, 11, 12, 21, 22}.
Definition: The composition a1 . . . ak avoids the composition b1 . . . bs if it does not include it.
For example, the set of compositions of 4 that do not include the composition 12 is
{4, 31, 211, 1111}.
Definition: The composition a = a1 . . . ak avoids the set of compositions A, if it avoids every
member of A.
For example, the set of compositions of 4 that do not include the members of the set {12, 21} is
{4, 1111}.

The million dollar question that we will answer in this article is
Question: Design an algorithm that inputs an arbitrary finite set of compositions, A, all of the
same length, and a variable x and outputs an explicit expression (a rational function of x) for
∞
X

a(n)xn

,

n=0

where a(n) is the number of compositions of n that do not contain any of the members of A.
For the sake of simplicity, we only treat the case where all the members of the forbidden set are of
the same length. The extension to the more general case is left to the interested reader.
Note that when the set A consists of a single composition of length 1, i.e. A = {k}, then the answer
is very easy. It is the set of compositions where the parts are from {1, . . . , k − 1} and hence the
required generating function is simply 1/(1 − x − x2 − . . . − xk−1 ). For example when A = {3} then
a(n) = Fn+1 .
Before going on, let’s give two sample theorems. Using our Maple package, the reader can generate
(potentially) infinitely many such theorems.
The first theorem enumerates compositions that never contain the composition 34543.
It was obtained, in less than a second, by typing

The Cluster Method for Compositions
Our algorithm is an adaptation of the Goulden-Jackson cluster method as described in [NZ].
We will use generating functions. The weight of a composition, C, is defined by
W eight(C) := xSum(C)

.

The weight-enumerator of the set of compositions, as noted above, is 1/(1 − ( 1−x

1−x
1−2x .

Let’s

Any composition is either empty (weight 1) or starts with a positive integer. Removing the first
entry results in a brand-new composition, i.e.
C = EmptyComposition or

C = i C′

,

for some positive integer i, and some smaller (possibly empty) composition C ′ . Let C be the set of
compositions, and P = {1, 2, 3, . . .} be the set of strictly positive integers. We have
C = {EmptyComposition}

[

P ×C

.

Taking weights on both sides (the weight of a set is the sum of the weights of its members), we
have
W eight(C) = W eight({EmptyComposition}) + W eight(P) W eight(C) .
4

P∞
Since W eight({EmptyComposition}) = 1 and W eight(P) = i=1 xi =
equation
x
W eight(C) ,
W eight(C) = 1 +
1−x
and solving for W eight(C) we get that it indeed equals 1/(1 −

x
1−x ,

we have the algebraic

x
1−x ).

Our problem is as follows. We are given a finite set of compositions, of the same length (that is
our simplifying assumption), let’s call it A, and we would like to find the weight-enumerator of the
set of compositions, let’s call it C(A), that do not contain any of the members of A. For simplicity
of exposition, let’s assume, until further notice, that the set of offenders is a singleton. Later we
will describe how to extend it to the case when we want to avoid, by containment, more than one
fixed composition.
In other words, we would like to find a way of computing
W eight(C(A))(x)

.

Being the weight-enumerator of the set C(A), extracting the coefficient of xn from its Maclaurin
expansion would give us the exact number of compositions of n that do not contain any of the
members of A.
Rather than counting good guys, that is very hard, we will do signed-weighted counting of pairs
(C, S), where C is any composition, and S is a subset of its set of ‘crimes’, i.e. a subset of its set of
offending containments, that in turn, is a certain subest of A (possibly empty, if C is a saint, and
ˆ
possibly the whole of A, if C is an arch-criminal). Let’s call this much larger set C(A),
and define
W eight(C, S) := xSum(C) (−1)|S|

.

Using the following two extremely deep identities
1 + (−1) = 0 ,
and
0a =



1 if
0 if

a = 0;
a > 0.

,

it follows, just as in the case of Goulden-Jackson, that
ˆ
W eight(C(A)) = W eight(C(A))

.

ˆ
We are left with the task of computing the right side, W eight(C(A)).
let’s illustrate the method by using a concrete example, where the set of offenders, A, consists of
ˆ
the single composition 232. In other words A = {232}. How do we compute W eight(C({232}))?
(and hence W eight(C({232}))?
5

Consider the composition 14542351, whose W eight is x1+4+5+4+2+3+5+1 = x25 . It has a total of
three ‘crimes’

These give rise to 23 members of C({232}).
For example, when S = ∅:

whose weight is (−1)0 x25 = x25 . Another example, is when S consists of the violations that start
at the 2nd and 3rd entries of the underlying composition C = 14542351:
1 4

5 4 2

whose weight is (−1)2 x25 = x25 . Yet another example, out of the eight possibilities , is when S

1 4

5 4 2

ˆ
Let’s analyze the anatomy of a typical member of C(A),
(C, S). We have one of the following three
cases
• It is the element (EmptyComposition, ∅).
ˆ
• The first entry of C does not belong to any offenders. This case is isomorphic to P × C(A)
• The first entry belongs to an offender. This offender may not overlap with any other offenders
that start later on, or may. Continuing to examine whether the last offender in the chain overlaps
with yet another offender, eventually we will stop, getting a ‘pre-cluster’, after which we have
6

ˆ
a brand-new (shorter) member of C(A).
Let’s denote by M(A) this set of pre-clusters. It is the
ˆ
subset of C(A) where every entry of the underlying composition belongs to at least one offender,
and every offender overlaps with at least another offender.
Still using A = {232} as our running example, here is a member of M(A):

(our object of desire) to F (x), we have
F (x) = 1 +

Solving for F (x), and abbreviating W eight(M(A)) to G(x), we get
F (x) =

− G(x)

.

It remains to compute the W eight-enumerator of the set of pre-clusters, M(A), alias G(x).
Let’s forget for a second the underlying composition (the top row in the above examples), and focus
on the offenders. Let’s call this pre-cluster with the top row (underlying composition) removed a
cluster. We will denote the set of clusters by N (A).
7

For example, still using A = {232}, here is an example of a cluster:

.

3 2

Let’s call the total number of columns the width. In the above example, the width is 9. What
compositions may serve as the underlying composition (top row) of such a cluster? Obviously,
its number of columns must be equal to the width, and its respective entries, must be ≥ to the
maximum of the entries of the offenders in the corresponding columns, where we ignore the empties
(or replace them by 0, note that every column has at least one non-empty entry, or else it would
not be a cluster). In the above example, the maxima of the nine columns are
232332332

.

We will call this the Skyline of the cluster.
For the sake of convenience, let’s represent a cluster as matrix, with empties replaced by 0, then
the above cluster is written
2

In terms of this associated matrix (where empty spaces are replaced by 0), we get a certain k × r
matrix (k is the number of offenders, and r is the width), the Skyline is defined as follows.
Skyline(L)j := max({Lij | 1 ≤ i ≤ k})

,

1 ≤ j ≤ r.

Note that the underlying compositions that can be put on top of a cluster L must satisfy Cj ≥
1 r
) (−1)k .
Skyline(L)j for all 1 ≤ j ≤ r. The W eight-enumerator of these is simply xSum(Skyline(L)) ( 1−x
This leads us to define yet-another weight, this time on clusters, introducing an auxiliary variable
t:
P oids(L)(x, t) := xSum(Skyline(L)) (−1)k tr .
We have
G(x) = W eight(M(A)) = P oids(N (A))(x,

1
) .
1−x

We are left with the task of computing P oids(N (A))(x, t).
A natural approach would be to break the set N (A) into states, and relate them to each other.
Continuing with the assumption that our set of offenders is a singleton, {A}, where A is of length
8

a, say, (A = 232 in our example, so a = 3), the state of a cluster is the list consisting of the first a
entries of its Skyline. For example the state of the cluster
2 3 2
0 2 3

0
2

3 2
0 2

0 0
3 2

,

is 233, while the state of the cluster
2
0

,

is 232. It is readily seen that in this case these are the only states. In general the computer can
easily determine the set of states, by generating all the clusters of width ≤ 2a − 1 (recall that a is
the width of A), and extracting the first a entries.
For each state, s, let Bs (x, t) be the Poids-enumerator of the set of clusters that belong to state s.
Given such a cluster, if it only has one row, then it must be A, and its Poids is (−1)xSum(A) ta . If it
has more than one row, we look at all the possibilities that it can overlap with the second row (i.e.
the number of starting zeros (empties) in the second row, and their state). These are the ‘children
states’. In fact it is much easier, to go the other way. For any state look at the ‘parent states’, i.e.
the one obtained by putting A at the top row in all the a − 1 possible ways.
For example, for the state 232, we can have
2 3 2

0

0 2 3

whose state is 233, and
,
whose state is 232. Hence the parents of the state 232 are 233 and 232.
On the other hands for the state 233, we can have

whose state is 233, and

whose state is 232. Hence the parents of the state 233 are also 233 and 232.
Recall that Bs (x, t) is the Poids-enumerator of the clusters with state s. For each state, we need
to set-up an equation.
9

Let’s first find an equation for B232 . The children of the state 232 are 232 and 233. If the child is
232 then it must be as follows
2 3 2 0 0
.
0 0 2 3 2
Removing the first row costs 2 + 3 = 5 units to the Skyline, and shrinks the width by 2, so the
contribution to B232 from this scenario (where the child is 232) is x5 t2 (−1)B232 .
If the child is 233 then it must be as follows
2

3 2

0 0

3 3

Removing the first row costs 2 + 3 = 5 units to the Skyline, and shrinks the width by 2, so the
contribution to B232 from this scenario (where the child is 233) is x5 t2 (−1)B233 .
In addition it may be just a one-row cluster, whose Poids is −x2+3+2 t3 = −x7 t3 .
Hence the equation for B232 is
B232 = −x7 t3 − x5 t2 B232 − x5 t2 B233

.

Next, let’s find an equation for B233 . The children of the state 233 are also 232 and 233. If the
child is 232 then it must be as follows
2 3 2

0

0 2 3

2

.

Removing the first row costs 2 + 3 − 2 = 3 units to the Skyline, and shrinks the width by 1, so the
contribution to B233 from this scenario (where the child is 232) is x3 t(−1)B232 .
If the child is 233 then it must be as follows
2 3 2

3

removing the first row costs 3 units to the Skyline, and shrinks the width by 1, so the contribution
to B232 from this scenario (where the child is 233) is x3 t(−1) B233 .
Since 233 is not a violation, we don’t have to add its Poids.
Hence the equation for B233 is
B233 = −x3 t B232 − x3 t B233
10

.

We have to solve the following system of two linear equations with two unknowns {B232 , B233 }:
{ B232 = −x7 t3 − x5 t2 B232 − x5 t2 B233

,

B233 = −x3 t B232 − x3 t B233 } .

Solving them gives

Avoiding many compositions (by containment)
The above method can be easily modified to handle multiple offenders. The clusters now can
have several violations starting at any location, and the effect of the Skyline on a given state is
determined by looking at the Skyline of the subset of violations starting at the same column. The
readers are welcome to look at the source code of procedure GFset(S,x) in the Maple package
Compositions.txt, where this case is implemented. So far we only handle sets of offenders all of
the same length. Our readers are welcome to extend it to the more general case where the offending
compositions may be of different lengths.
Keeping track of the number of occurrences
So far we described how to find the exact number, let’s call it aS (n) of compositions of length n,
that avoid (i.e. do not contain) any members of the set of compositions S = {C1 , ..., Cr } . We
gave an efficient algorithm, implemented in the Maple package Compositions.txt, to explicitly
find the generating function, let’s call fS (x)
fS (x) :=

∞
X

a(n) xn

.

n=0

Note that, out of laziness, (so far) we only implemented the case where all the members of the
offending set, S = {C1 , ..., Cr }, are of the same length.
11

.

But it is very hard to stay out of trouble. Suppose that you want to find the exact number, let’s
call it AS (n; c1 , . . . , cr ) of compositions of n that contain
C1 , c1 times, C2 , c2 times, . . . , Cr , cr times.
Of course, our former quantity, aS (n) is just the special case c1 = 0, c2 = 0, . . . , cr = 0, i.e.
aS (n) = AS (n; 0, 0, . . . , 0)

.

All the information about the discrete function AS (n; c1 , . . . , cr ), with 1 + r discrete variables, is
encapsulated in the multi-variable rational function, with 1+r ‘continuous’ variables x, X1 , . . . , Xr

Of course fS (x) = FS (x; 0, 0, . . . , 0).
The beauty of the cluster method is that a very tiny tweak in the former algorithm yields a way
to compute FS . Rather then use the deep identity 0 = 1 + (−1) we use the only slightly deeper
identity X = 1 + (X − 1) applied to X = X1 , X = X2 , . . ., X = Xr . This entails redefining the
Poids of a cluster C, to be
xSkyline(C) (as before)
multiplied by (X1 − 1)N umberOf C1

The set of equations is modified accordingly, and Maple solves it. Of course, now it takes much
longer, since we have so many more symbols, but the principle is the same.
This is implemented (still under the simplifying assumption of the members of the offending set all
of the same length) in the Maple package CompositionsPlus.txt, also available from the front of
this article, where there are also sample input and output files.
Using the method of [Z], (that have been included in this package) we can do statistical analysis of
the random variables ‘Number of occurrences of Ci ’, for the various members of S, defined on the
sample space of all compositions of n, as well as how they interact.
We do it by using the multi-variable generating function FS .
By taking partial derivatives, and then setting all the variables Xi to be 1, we find expressions for the
expectation, variance, (these are always linear in n) and higher moments (certain polynomials in n).

We can also find mixed moments for any set of such random variables, in particular, the asymptotic
correlation, and confirm that for any such pair, these random variables are joint asymptotically
normal, alas (of course) , not independently so. Using the asymptotic correlation one can confirm
this by computing the mixed moments of the corresponding bi-variate normal distribution with
correlation ρ,

Our Maple package does that automatically (to any desired order).
Just to cite one example, typing
InfoX2V([2,3,4],[4,3,2],x,X,Y,n,6):
in the Maple package CompositionsPlus.txt, yields the following theorem.
