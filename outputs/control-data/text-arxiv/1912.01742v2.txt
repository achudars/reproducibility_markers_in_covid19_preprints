Abstract
Radiation damage on front-end readout and trigger electronics is an important issue in the COMET Phase-I experiment
at J-PARC, which plans to search for the neutrinoless transition of a muon to an electron. To produce an intense
muon beam, a high-power proton beam impinges on a graphite target, resulting in a high-radiation environment. We
require radiation tolerance to a total dose of 1.0 kGy and 1 MeV equivalent neutron fluence of 1.0 × 1012 neq cm−2
including a safety factor of 5 over the duration of the physics measurement. The use of commercially-available
electronics components which have high radiation tolerance, if such components can be secured, is desirable in such
an environment. The radiation hardness of commercial electronic components has been evaluated in gamma-ray and
neutron irradiation tests. As results of these tests, voltage regulators, ADCs, DACs, and several other components
were found to have enough tolerance to both gamma-ray and neutron irradiation at the level we require.
Keywords: radiation tolerance, voltage regulator, ADC, DAC

1. Introduction
The COherent Muon To Electron Transition (COMET) Phase-I experiment will take place at the Japan Proton
Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) in Tokai, Japan [1]. The aim of this experiment is to search for the neutrinoless transition of a muon to an electron (µ–e conversion) in a muonic atom, which has never been observed yet [2],
with a single event sensitivity of 3 × 10−15 in a 150 day-long physics measurement. This sensitivity is a factor of
100 better than the current limit from SINDRUM-II [3]. In order to reach this sensitivity, an 8 GeV, 3.2 kW proton
beam is extracted from the J-PARC Main Ring and impinged on a graphite target; this will enable to produce the most
intense muon beam produced from pion decay. The muons are stopped in aluminium target disks and form muonic
atoms. The signal electrons from the µ–e conversion are detected by a cylindrical drift chamber and a set of trigger
hodoscope counters in a solenoid magnet. To measure the muon beam profile and the beam background, we also adopt
straw-tube trackers and electron calorimeters, which are prototype detectors for the COMET Phase-II experiment. We
have developed several types of readout and trigger electronics for recording the data from these detectors.
Interaction of a high-power proton beam with the pion-production target results in a high-radiation environment
in the experimental hall. Since the front-end and signal processing electronics are located near the detector to avoid
effects such as electrical noise, cross-talk, signal degradation, they are greatly affected by the radiation environment. In

particular, the total ionizing dose (TID) from gamma-rays and the displacement damage dose (DDD) from neutrons
cause significant degradation in the performance of electronics. In order to understand the radiation environment
around the COMET beamline, independent simulation studies using PHITS version 2.76 [4] and Geant4 version
10.1 [5] were performed. According to the simulation study, the electronics are expected to withstand a total dose of
1.0 kGy and neutron fluence of 1.0×1012 neq cm−2 § during the 150-day physics data taking period [6], where radiation
levels include a safety factor of 5 to take into account the uncertainties in the simulation results.
To ensure that the electronics work stably at these radiation levels, we have investigated the radiation hardness of
the commercial electronic components that would be used in the COMET front-end electronics and most importantly
the power regulator, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The development of
a new radiation-hard application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is not an option on the time-scale of the COMET
Phase-I experiment. Commercial high-reliability electronic components for space and military application also exist
for some parts, however, these are overly-specialised for the purposes of this experiment. Such high-reliability parts
do not exist in the case of electronic components characterized by high speed, high efficiency, and low noise, which
are all necessary specifications in the development of the COMET front-end electronics boards. Therefore, the choice
was made to use more standard components, but required that each of the components that are employed in the frontend board are evaluated on their radiation hardness using gamma-ray sources and neutron beams. In this paper, the
results of these tests are summarized.‡
2. Electronics components for COMET Phase-I
All the electronic components are required to have enough radiation tolerance in the COMET Phase-I experiment
that the readout electronics can be operated stably during the whole physics data-taking run. Soft and hard errors
on the components need to be investigated. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in the frontend electronics boards, but soft errors by neutrons can generate bit flips. We have developed FPGA firmware which
incorporate auto-recovery schemes to repair these flips. The error rates for several FPGAs have already been tested and
reported [7]. Compared to the soft errors, hard damage from TID and DDD to electronic components are permanent
and unrecoverable. In this study, commercial parts which are not certified for radiation-hardness were tested. The
electronic components that were tested for radiation hardness include voltage regulators, Digital to Analog Converters
(DAC), Analog to Digital Converters (ADC), splitters, OR gates, and multiplexers. Several different brands and types
of regulators are tested, as the required specification on the operating voltages are different from one board to another.
Switching regulators generate lower heat than linear regulators as a result of the high power efficiency and are suitable
for use in temperature-controlled areas and for the first stage when regulating external power. On the other hand, linear
regulators allow for simpler circuit configurations and lower noise levels. We investigated the radiation tolerance for
both types of regulator. Analog circuits must be used to process the analog signals from the detectors. DACs are used
to adjust their processing parameters such as threshold voltages. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, all the readout
electronics which have on-board ADC chips are located close to the detectors. In this situation, it is essential to
implement ADCs on the readout electronics. Splitters, OR gates, and multiplexers are needed to distribute a common
clock and a trigger signal to all the front-end electronics. In the COMET trigger system, differential signal lines are
used for those signals, and single-end signal lines are also used in laboratory tests.
3. Experimental setup
The experimental setup for each electronic components is presented in the following. Candidates for the electronic
components are summarized in Table 1. In the tests, only the target samples were located in the radiation area. To
avoid radiation damage to other devices such as power supplies and data loggers, they were located on the outside of
the radiation area.

3.1. Voltage regulators
To investigate the radiation hardness of commercial voltage regulators, we produced custom printed circuit boards
(PCB) as shown in Figure 1. For the other regulators, we used commercial evaluation boards provided by the regulator
manufacturers. The conditions of the real front-end readout and trigger boards are emulated by attaching load resistors
to the regulators. The prototypes of the readout electronics developed for the COMET Phase-I experiment give a
realistic current load environment and were utilized to test a subset of the regulators. The following commercial
evaluation boards were used;
• Linear Technology
DC2010A for LT8612
DC2019B for LT8614
DC1623A for LTM8033
• Texas Instruments
TPS7A7200EVM-718 for TPS7A7200
TPS74401EVM-118 for TPS74401
Figure 2 shows the typical experimental setup. Only the test boards are located in the radiation area. Power supply
modules and data loggers were located outside the radiation area to avoid radiation damage. The output voltage of
the regulators was monitored and recorded by data loggers during exposure. The gamma-ray irradiation dose rate was
chosen to be 4.5 Gy h−1 which is 80 times higher than the rate of the COMET Phase-I experiment, 6.0 × 10−2 Gy h−1 .

Figure 2: The schematic view of the experimental setup. Voltage regulators were supplied with input voltage and their outputs were recorded by
data loggers outside a radiation area.

Tests under higher dose rates were also performed for some regulators in order to investigate the dependence of the
gamma-ray tolerance on the dose rate. These dose rate were 2.2 × 101 Gy h−1 , 2.0 × 102 Gy h−1 , 2.3 × 102 Gy h−1 , and
4.0 × 102 Gy h−1 . The 29 types of voltage regulators listed in Table 1 were irradiated with gamma-rays. To obtain
reliable results for the electronics used in the COMET Phase-I experiment, we irradiated six or more samples for each
type of regulator except LT8612 and LT8614, for which only three samples each were tested. Power cycles were
performed every 2.0 × 102 Gy exposure because it was observed that voltage regulators could break when performing
a power cycle after irradiation.
3.2. DACs
For the selection of radiation-hard DACs, ten types of DAC were tested. DAC candidates were mounted on
handmade circuit boards for both neutron and gamma-ray irradiations. Before irradiation, the register values on the
DACs were determined. A fixed input voltage was applied to a DAC during irradiation. The DAC output signals were
measured and recorded with a data logger.
3.3. ADCs
Several test PCB boards with ADCs were fabricated and used for radiation tests. In the gamma-ray irradiation
tests, the ADCs received periodical square waves from a function generator and generated digitized waveforms during
irradiation. Differences in the waveforms recorded before and during irradiation were used to evaluate the deterioration from radiation. In the case of neutron irradiation, the prototype boards of the readout electronics on which the
ADCs are to be implemented were irradiated.
3.4. Other components
We performed an integrated irradiation test on the electronics components listed below. The circuit diagram of the
test board developed in this purpose is shown in Figure 3.

The test board has an input port for an SN65LVDS391 line driver, which converts a single-end signal to differential
signals and sends them to MAX9175. Outputs of the MAX9175 are sent to SN65LVDT348 converting them to
single-end signals and SN65LVDS116 dividing them to 16 differential lines. Two lines of the four single-end signals
from SN65LVDT348 are passed through the OR gate of SN74AUP1G32 and the multiplexer of ADG1606. On the
other hand, all the differential signals from SN65LVDS116 are converted to single-end signals by SN65LVDT386
and processed by the logical disjunction in CD4078BM96. During irradiation, a pulsed input signal was injected into
SN65LVDS391 and the outputs from ADG1606 and CD4078BM96 were measured by using an oscilloscope. This
evaluation method was adopted for both gamma-ray and neutron irradiation tests.
4. Experimental facilities
The gamma-ray irradiation tests were performed at four facilities: the Cobalt-60 Gamma-ray Irradiation Facility
at the National Institute for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, formerly known as JAEA Takasaki;
the Tokyo Institute of Technology Radioisotope Research Center; Research Laboratory for Quantum Beam Science,
Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research (ISIR) at Osaka University; and the Advanced Radiation Technology
Institute of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute. All the facilities provide 1.17 and 1.33 MeV gamma-rays
from 60 Co sources. Dose rates were controlled by changing the distance between the 60 Co source and the target
sample.
For the neutron irradiation, We used two tandem electrostatic accelerators at Kobe University and Kyushu University. The accelerator in Kobe University generates a neutron beam with an energy peak of 2 MeV from the
9
Be (d, n)10 B reaction and an incoming 3 MeV deuteron beam. The neutron beam flux is (4.9 ± 1.5)×106 neq cm−2 sec−1
with a 1 µA beam current at 10 cm from the Be target on the beam axis, including distance and angular uncertainties.
Another tandem electrostatic accelerator in Kyushu University generates a neutron beam from the 12 C (d, n)13 N reaction with a 9 MeV deuteron beam. According to past measurement results in this facility [9], the neutron beam flux is
4.3 × 107 neq cm−2 sec−1 with a 1 µA beam current at 10 cm from the C target on the beam axis.

5. Measurements & Results
To investigate the TID effect of gamma-rays and the DDD effect of neutrons on each electronic component with
the total dose of 1.0 kGy and the neutron fluence of 1.0 × 1012 neq cm−2 respectively, we measured their gamma-ray
and neutron tolerances.

5.1.1. Gamma-ray tolerance
Figure 4 shows the test results of two of the positive-switching regulators (LT8612 and LT8614) and five of the
positive-linear regulators (four LT1963 series and LT3070). Both positive-switching regulators survived beyond the
required dosage. We evaluated the dose-rate dependence of gamma-ray tolerance using three samples of LT8612 and
LT8614. All those samples show the voltage increasing from 5.0 V up to 5.4 V after irradiation of 1.0 kGy, independently of the dose rate. These changes of the output were not related with the timing of power cycle either. Since
the increase in their outputs occurred after 1.0 kGy irradiation, they meet the requirement. LTM4620, LTM4644, and
LMZ10503 were suddenly broke at 0.3 kGy, 1.1 kGy and 0.8 kGy irradiation, respectively. The output of LTM8033
increased from 3.3 V to 3.6 V after 0.2 kGy irradiation and becomes more than 4.0 V at 1.0 kGy irradiation.

Figure 4: Results of positive-switching/linear regulators in the gamma-ray irradiation tests.

Among the irradiated positive-linear regulators, all the series of LT1963 survived beyond the required dosage. In
the tests, we set the output of LT1963, whose output is adjustable, to 1.5 V. After 0.1 kGy irradiation, the outputs of all
LT1963s dropped. However, this deterioration was recovered by raising the input voltage and was not observed after
0.6 kGy irradiation. Following gamma-ray irradiation, the output of LT1963-3.3 changed from 3.3 V to 3.4 V and the
output of LT1963-2.5 changed from 2.5 V to 2.6 V. These changes are small enough for the absolute maximum ratings
of the other electronic components, to which these regulators apply voltage. Five samples of LT3070 were exposed
with the dose rate of 2.0 × 102 Gy h−1 . Then, all the samples were subject to an increase in output after about 0.7 kGy
irradiation and were broken before 1.5 kGy irradiation. After this test, the other five samples of LT3070 were irradiated
again with the dose rate of 4.5 Gy h−1 and survived beyond 2.0 kGy irradiation. The outputs also increased from
1.0 V to about 1.2 V, but these phenomena happened after 1.0 kGy irradiation. MAX8556, TPS7A7200, TPS74401,
TPS70851, and ADP1755 were suddenly broken at 0.8 kGy, 1.0 kGy, 1.4 kGy, 0.6 kGy, and 0.8 kGy, respectively.
It was confirmed that the gamma-ray tolerances of LT8612, LT8614, the LT1963 series, and LT3070 satisfied
the requirements for the COMET Phase-I experiment. These results also show that the voltage drop in the voltage
regulators decreased from gamma-ray irradiation before complete failure. The result for LT8612 is consistent with the
study by the ATLAS New Small Wheel group [8], but the one for ADP1755 is different from that study. The ATLAS
group used a 220 MeV proton beam, and its energy deposition on the regulator is different from the case of gamma-ray
irradiation. Furthermore, we do not know the structure and material composition of the regulators that would allow us
to calculate the energy loss. This could be the cause of the discrepancy between their results and ours.
Four negative-linear regulators – L79, MC7905, NJM2828, and ADP7182 – survived after 2.0 kGy irradiation.
Two samples were tested for each regulator. The outputs of NJM2828 and ADP7182 samples were changed by the
TID effect; on the other hand, the outputs of L79 and MC7905 were stable. A further eight samples for each regulator
– L79 and MC7905 – were investigated and also survived to 2.0 kGy irradiation. The irradiation results of L79,
MC7905, and ADP7182 are shown in Figure 5. The outputs of LT1964, LT3015, LT3032, LT3090, LT3091, and

the output of MIC5271 increased from −5 V to 0 V before 0.2 kGy irradiation.

5.1.2. Neutron tolerance
For the positive-switching regulator selection, LT8612 and LT8614, which have enough tolerance against gammaray irradiation, were the focus of the neutron irradiation tests. The flux dependence of the neutron irradiation tolerance
was evaluated by placing the test boards at a different distance from the Be target, and by irradiating all of them at
the same time. Figure 6 shows the results. For LT8612, the average values of neutron flux at 22 mm and 48 mm were
8.8 × 107 neq cm−2 sec−1 and 1.9 × 107 neq cm−2 sec−1 , respectively. For LT8614, the average values of neutron flux
at 16 mm and 40 mm were 1.4 × 108 neq cm−2 sec−1 and 2.3 × 107 neq cm−2 sec−1 , respectively. All of them survived
beyond the neutron dosage required and any flux dependence has not been observed.
The positive-linear regulators – the series of LT1963 and LT3070 – have already been used for the front-end
electronics and their prototypes. These electronics were irradiated over 1.0 × 1012 neq cm−2 and permanent damage
has never been observed for any of the electronics [7]. Therefore, it was concluded that these positive-linear regulators
can survive to the neutron dosage required.

Three negative-linear regulators – L79, MC7905, and ADP7182 – survived beyond the neutron dosage required.
Two samples for each regulator were irradiated and these results are shown in Figure 7.
5.2. DACs
Ten types of DACs listed in Table 1 were tested for neutron tolerance, with more than 3.0 × 1012 neq cm−2 . After
the irradiation, all DACs survived, and the output voltages were consistent.
Out of these DACs, only six were irradiated with gamma-rays. Figure 8 shows the output changes in each DAC
during the test. After 0.9 kGy and before 1.0 kGy irradiation, the output of DAC7564 decreased to 0.0 V and the
output of DAC7565 suddenly increased to 4.9 V. AD5624 and AD5624R stopped functioning after a power cycle
after a dose of 0.3 kGy. Two output levels of AD5324 – 2.2 V and 3.8 V – were tested. AD5324 with both output
levels survived after 1.0 kGy irradiation while it was observed that the maximum change of its output was 0.3 V.

5.3. ADCs
LTC2264 and AD9287 were irradiated with gamma-rays. During and after irradiation, no waveform change was
observed. The results are shown in Figure 9. The data points are the ratios of ADC outputs between the before and
during irradiation minus 1, and the error bars are the standard deviations of the distributions. The performance of
LTC2264 was not degraded during the whole irradiation. For AD9287 the mean values fluctuated from 0 but did not
change significantly. Hence the performances of both the ADCs were not degraded during irradiation and after a dose
of 1.0 kGy. AD9637 from Analog Devices was mounted on the readout electronics prototype which was irradiated
with gamma-rays. It was confirmed that it could maintain its performance after more than 1.0 kGy irradiation. Power
cycles for these ADCs were done after irradiation, and all of them worked fine.
Neutron tolerances of LTC2264, AD9637, and AD9287 were evaluated. The prototype boards of the readout
electronics on which these ADCs were implemented were exposed to a fluence of at least 1.0 × 1012 neq cm−2 [7].
After neutron irradiation tests, the outputs of all the ADCs were unchanged. All the ADCs exposed to the nominal
neutron irradiation dose did not exhibit permanent damage. Finally, it is concluded that the radiation tolerances of
LTC2264, AD9287, and AD9637 met the requirement for the COMET Phase-I experiment.
5.4. Other components
After the neutron irradiation of over 1.7 × 1012 neq cm−2 , no deterioration was observed. Only CD4078BM96
stopped functioning after a gamma-ray dose of 0.4 kGy, but all the other components showed no signs of malfunction
after a dose of at least 1.0 kGy.
5.5. Summary
The gamma-ray and neutron irradiation tolerances for voltage regulators are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3. Two positive-switching, six positive-linear, and three negative-linear regulators met the requirements from
the COMET Phase-I radiation environment. The result for LT1963 was consistent with the Belle II collaboration

6. Conclusion
Radiation tolerance of electronic components is crucial to develop reliable front-end electronics for the COMET
Phase-I experiment. Therefore, we performed a series of neutron and gamma-ray irradiation tests for the following
commercial parts to investigate the radiation tolerant parts that can withstand the high radiation level expected: voltage
regulators, a DAC, ADCs, High-Speed Differential Line Drivers, a High-Speed Differential Receiver, a Splitter, a
Positive OR gate, a NOR/OR gate, and a Multiplexer. The devices were exposed to gamma-rays and neutrons with
the required dosage. As a result, all of the suitable components were selected. In addition, we will perform further
irradiation tests for components where less than five samples were irradiated, to confirm our results. We have started
finalizing the designs of the electronics by using the components that passed the irradiation tests.

Table 2: Summary of gamma-ray and neutron irradiation tolerances for positive-voltage regulators. Loads are the resistances of resistors connected
to the regulator outputs. The values of input voltage were measured on the input ports of the test boards. In the column of the neutron tolerance
blanks mean no measurement in the tests. The neutron tolerances of the series of LT1963, LT3070 and LMZ10503 were calculated from the results
of the neutron irradiation tests for the front-end electronics, where these regulators were mounted [7].
