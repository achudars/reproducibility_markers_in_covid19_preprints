Abstract
We study some SDEs derived from the q → 1 limit of a 2D surface growth model called the qWhittaker process. The fluctuations are proven to exhibit Gaussian characteristics that “come down
from infinity”: After rescaling and re-centering, convergence to the time-inverted stationary additive
stochastic heat equation holds. The point of view in this paper is a probabilistic representation of
the SDEs by independent sums. By this connection, the normal and Poisson approximations and
the in-between slow decorrelation, all in particular integrated forms, explain the convergence of the
re-centered covariance functions. With bounds and divergent constants from these approximations,
the proof of the process-level convergence identifies additional divergent terms in the dynamics and
considers cancellation arguments that treat the independent sums as discrete spin systems.

Introduction

The original model behind this paper is the q-Whittaker process which goes back to Borodin
and Corwin [6]. The process is a discrete interacting particle system modeling surface growth
dynamics. In the limit of q → 1, a recent work of Borodin, Corwin and Ferrari [7] proves
a convergence of the fluctuations by taking an iterated scaling limit. Our objective in this
paper is the final stage of the limiting scheme. It obtains a pointwise limit of the (space-time)
covariance functions of the following SDEs:
dξt (a) = t−1 (AL ξt )(a)dt + dBt (a),

a ∈ TL , 0 < t < ∞,

(1.1)

where L is an integer ≥ 3 and TL is the following upper triangular lattice:
TL = {a = (a1 , a2 ) ∈ N2 ; 1 ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ L}.

(1.2)

In (1.1), AL can be identified as a generator matrix. The corresponding Markov chain is given
by the invertible linear transformation (m1 , m2 ) 7→ (m1 + 1, m1 + m2 + 1) of two independent
linear pure death processes, such that the sum of the populations does not exceed L − 1. The
noise terms are given by a standard Brownian motion {Bt (a); a ∈ TL }. Due to the original
discrete dynamics, we call these SDEs from [7] the Whittaker SDEs.
Our goal in this paper is to prove a rescaled limit of the Whittaker SDEs at the process level.
For the convergence of the covariance functions, we choose a method very different from the
method in [7] by turning to a probabilistic representation of solutions of the SDEs. Hence, the
entire spectrum of limit theorems for sums of Bernoulli random variables enters and becomes
the point of departure of the present proofs.
Let us begin by explaining connections between the Whittaker SDEs and surface growth
dynamics in terms of the original discrete model. First, given an integer L ≥ 3, the q-Whittaker
process is a stochastic dynamic model of particles living in L rising levels. Each level is a copy
of the one-dimensional integer lattice. The number of particles at each level is the same as the
level number. The particles at each level are ordered from the right to the left. Accordingly, a
configuration of the whole system takes values in ZTL with respect to the finite triangular lattice
2

TL defined above. The particle system evolves according to some special rates depending on q
and local configurations. The updates also respect an interlacing relation induced by TL on the
overall particle positions. See Figure 1.1 for an example of the eligible configurations. More
specifically, when a particle, say, at a ∈ TL is chosen for a transition according to the rates, it
attempts to jump to the right lattice point. This jump is successful if the chosen particle is
not “blocked”, in a sense that the jump does not break the assumed interlacing relation. In
this case, the chosen particle also “pushes” to the right, by one lattice point, the entirety of
the vertical string of particles above it in terms of positions and indices. In other words, these
particles being pushed originally occupy the same integer site at the respective levels as the
chosen particle and are indexed by a + (0, 1), · · · , a + (0, ℓ − 1), such that ℓ ≥ 1 is maximal.
See Section 2.1 for the details of these mechanisms.
The q-Whittaker process has an important meaning of being a model of surface growth.
Configurations of the interlacing particles can be mapped to discrete surfaces (via lozenge
tilings). So transitions of particle configurations correspond to transitions of heights in the
discrete surfaces [9, Section 1.1]. From a broader perspective, the pushing mechanism and the
blocking mechanism define the q-Whittaker process as a generalization of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) that plays an important role in the 1D Kardar–
Parisi–Zhang universality class [24]. Moreover, since the pushing mechanism induces a special
tilt direction in the discrete surfaces, it is believed that the q-Whittaker process falls in the
anisotropic Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class. In this direction, Wolf’s conjecture [32]
from the physics
√ literature expects that the large time fluctuations in this class are universally
of the order ln t. Moreover, the probabilistic counterpart of this magnitude is the 2D Gaussian
free field [9, Section 1.4]. See [1, 30] for more backgrounds.
For the q-Whittaker process, the proof of this physical relation is first obtained in an insightful work by Borodin and Ferrari [9] for the case q = 0. For the q → 1 dynamics, an
intermediate step of the proof in [7] leads to the Whittaker SDEs. See (2.4) for a summary of
the limiting schemes. In particular, though introduced with a probabilistic interpretation by
pure death processes above, in [7], the matrices AL in the drift coefficients of the SDEs appear
with the explicit algebraic forms, and the methods are developed accordingly.
In the direction of universality, Wolf’s conjecture is also proven in [8] for the q-Whittaker
driven particle system [13]. This model is defined on periodic lattices in two dimensions. It
gives another discrete surface growth dynamics that include a special tilt direction. For the
q → 1 fluctuations, an intermediate step of the proof in [8] derives some Ornstein–Uhlenbeck
finite-dimensional SDEs (called the Whittaker driven SDEs in [12]) similar to the Whittaker
SDEs. The constant matrices in the drift coefficients of the Whittaker driven SDEs continue to
incorporate some characteristics of the discrete dynamics. But they are structurally different
from the matrices AL . Not all of the off-diagonal entries are nonnegative. In this case, discrete
Fourier transforms are the central tool for proving the convergence. By contrast, the method
to be discussed below for the Whittaker SDEs considers different properties, mainly the probabilistic interpretation of AL and some limiting stationarity. Consequently, except for the use of
a divergent characteristic direction for space and time to be specified below, the present proofs
show very mild technical overlaps with those in [12]. On the other hand, another investigation
toward the universality in Wolf’s conjecture by unifying [12] and the present paper may be
possible, given the entrance of the central limit theorem to be explained below. It shall develop
along a comparison of the proofs with the classical counterparts that use Fourier transforms in
proving the central limit theorem. We do not pursue the details here, though.

The main result of this paper proves a rescaled limit of the Gaussian stochastic integral parts
{ζt (a); a ∈ TL } in the solutions of the Whittaker SDEs. It can be summarized informally as
the theorem below. See Theorems 3.2 and 4.5 for the precise statements. For convenience, the
proof works with an infinite-dimensional Gaussian process from consistently extending these
parts of all finite L (see Proposition 2.1 and the discussion below it). The limiting process is
based on the 2D additive stochastic heat equation [31]:
∆
∂X
(x, t) = X(x, t) + Ẇ (x, t),
∂t
2

(1.3)

where Ẇ is space-time white noise. Note that various rescaled limits of the covariance functions
of the Whittaker SDEs are already obtained in [7]. But these results are with forms and methods
all different from those introduced here. See Remark 3.3 (2◦ ). Connections to the stationary
2D additive stochastic heat equation are also pointed out in [7].
Theorem (Informal version). Let {ζt (a); a ∈ T∞ } denote the Gaussian stochastic integral
part in the solution of the infinite-level Whittaker SDE, and let X(x, t) denote the stationary
solution of the 2D additive stochastic heat equation (1.3). Then as N → ∞,

holds in the following two modes of convergence: (1) pointwise convergence of space-time
covariance functions modulo constants, and (2) convergence in distribution as càdlàg processes
that take values in the space of tempered distributions on R2 modulo constants.

Let us explain the theorem in more detail. First, the rescaling in (1.4) is along the
characteristic direction (x, t) 7→ (t + tx, t) followed by the Edwards–Wilkinson scaling [15]:
(x, t, ζ) 7→ (N −1/2 x, Nt, N 0 ζ). For the limiting process, stationarity holds in the form that the
initial condition is given by the massless 2D log-correlated Gaussian free field (Section 4.2). Due
to the time inversion (t 7→ t−1 ), the informal process-level picture thus shows that the limiting
fluctuations “come down from infinity” along the clock of the additive stochastic heat equation.
In particular, this result should be an answer to the inquiry in [7, Section 1.2] whether, for time
varying over the entire half-line, the fluctuations of the q-Whittaker process can be related to
the stationary additive stochastic heat equation. There in [7], the relation is established over
the time interval [0, 1].
For the proof, we first consider a rescaled limit of the covariance functions. We follow an
initial step in [7, Lemma 5.7] but subsequently turn to a method that entirely circumvents the
use of complex contour integrals and special functions in the original method of [7]. That step
from [7] identifies AL as the generator matrix of a linear transformation of two i.i.d. Markov
chains with linearly decreasing rates. The method of our choosing starts with the interpretation
that the latter two Markov chains are linear pure death processes and model the population size
of individuals with i.i.d. exponential lifetimes. Moreover, the chains can be represented as sums
of independent Bernoulli variables that keep track of the numbers of survivors. The central
limit theorem thus leads to the Gaussian characteristic of the limit. It induces a natural choice
of the rescaling scheme, and its local version gives approximations by Gaussian densities. The
additive stochastic heat equation arises since its solution is structurally similar to the solutions
of the Whittaker SDEs.

Given the crucial connection to independent sums, we are still faced with the basic question of whether the normal approximations are enough. The issue arises from the following

where x, y ∈ R2 , 0 ≤ s ≤ t < ∞, and Sm (p) and Sm
′ (p ) are independent binomial random vari′
ables such that Sm (p) has parameters (m, p), and Sm′ (p′ ) is similarly defined (Proposition 2.4).
In (1.5), the parameters of the Bernoulli random variables in the order-N sums are integrated
out up to order 1. With this manner, the convergence of the probabilities has to be proven
for essentially all the possible values of the parameters simultaneously. Therefore, the above
sketch of proof actually leaves out the Poisson approximations, and more importantly, the “slow
decorrelation” of sums of Bernoulli variables from the Poisson limit to the Gaussian limit. The
slow decorrelation raises most of the technicality in this stage. The key is to carry it out by
calculating the asymptotics of an integral of probabilities as in (1.5), the associated interval
being changed to 1 ≪ r ≪ N where an integrated Poisson approximation and an integrated
local central limit theorem are joined. The proof also needs to quantify these ≪-bounds of r.
In particular, one ingredient to get the integrated Poisson approximation is a bound from the
Stein–Chen method [3, 4]. Along this way, some logarithmically divergent constants, which also
appear in [7], and the stationarity in the limiting equation arise from integrating the decorrelating probabilities. See Section 3. Let us stress that we do not pursue the optimality of error
bounds for these integrated approximations. Our interest is to investigate possible connections
between the normal and Poisson approximations and the universality in Wolf’s conjecture. This
direction is in the same spirit as the comparison with the proof in [12] for the Whittaker drive
SDEs mentioned above.
The process-level convergence of the rescaled processes considers the weak formulation by
integrating out space. In this form, the main result proves the uniform Hölder continuity in
time on compacts of the covariance functions. The method begins when proving the pointwise
convergence of the covariance functions already discussed above, as we quantify appropriate
bounds throughout. For the next step (Section 5), the divergent constants from integrating
decorrelating probabilities are removed by re-centering. The main work then bounds the Hölder
coefficients by removing some additional divergent terms (Lemma 5.5). The issue here arises
since it is not clear how these divergent terms can cancel each other without further transformations. The integral structures of these terms appear to be special and different from those
in the decorrelation. To find ways for the cancellations, the binomial integration by parts,
and some recursive identities for the independent sums enter as the central tools. Essentially,
by involving these tools, we treat the independent sums of Bernoulli random variables in the
covariance functions as discrete spin systems. In summary, this part of the present paper shows
a different application of the probabilistic presentation of the Whittaker SDEs. Moreover, as in
[12], it deals with dynamical singularities in the surface growth, along a divergent characteristic
direction and not present in proving the convergence of covariance functions.
Finally, we remark that asymptotic expansions for the Poisson approximations [2] and the
normal approximations [22] apply to the independent sums in this paper. Given this background, it may be of interest to investigate higher-order asymptotics of the fluctuations of the
Whittaker SDEs at the process level.

The Whittaker SDEs

In this section, we recall more details of the Whittaker SDEs derived in [7, Proposition 5.5].
Then we show that these SDEs can be solved explicitly by the driving Brownian motion and
sums of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. Due to this connection, we turn to limit theorems of
independent sums in the next section.

2.1

Connections to the q-Whittaker process

For fixed q ∈ [0, 1) and integer L ≥ 3, the q-Whittaker process (Λqt )t≥0 considers L(L + 1)/2
many particles indexed by TL , where TL is defined by (1.2). In any state λ ∈ ZTL of the system,
the following interlacing relation of particles holds:
λ(a1 + 1, a2 ) ≤ λ(a1 , a2 − 1) ≤ λ(a1 , a2 ), ∀ a = (a1 , a2 ) ∈ TL , a2 ≥ 2, a2 ≥ a1 + 1.

(2.1)

For q > 0, the particle labelled by a ∈ TL attempts to jump to the right (λ(a) 7→ λ(a) + 1)
and, if successful, pushes other particles in the way described in Section 1, with rate

(2.2)
cq (a, λ) =
1 − q λ(a1 ,a2 )−λ(a1 ,a2 −1)+1
Here in (2.2), 1 − q λ(a1 −1,a2 −1)−λ(a1 ,a2 ) is understood to be 1 if (a1 − 1, a2 − 1) ∈
/ TL ; a similar
λ(a1 ,a2 )−λ(a1 +1,a2 )+1

One key feature of cq (a, λ) is that it is zero when λ(a1 − 1, a2 − 1) = λ(a1 , a2 ). The particle
labelled by a is thus “blocked” by the particle labelled by (a1 − 1, a2 − 1), as illustrated in
Figure 1.1. This condition ensures that the interlacing relation in (2.1) is maintained. For
q = 0, the rates are extended by continuity so that c0 (a, λ) = 1 whenever the particle labelled
by a under λ is not blocked, and c0 (a, λ) = 0 otherwise. (This case is not used in the present
paper.) See [9, Section 1.1] (for q = 0), [6, Definition 3.28], and [7, Section 2.5.2].

See [7, Sections 3 and 4] for the limits in (2.4).
Note that A has nonnegative off-diagonal entries by the definition of T∞ . Hence, A is a
generator matrix. The semigroup (etA ; t ≥ 0) is Markovian. Moreover, given any integer L ≥ 3,
AL depends only on the lattice points in TL . It also holds that AL is a generator and (etAL ; t ≥ 0)
is Markovian. See Figure 2.1 for an example. Moreover, AL shows the special jump rates (2.2)
in the limit and how the SDEs remember where the pushing and blocking come from in the
discrete dynamics. For example, in (2.5), b = a − (1, 1) is the label of the particle that can
block a jump of the particle labelled by a, and b = a − (0, 1) is the label of the particle that
can push the particle labelled by a or propagate a push.

The following proposition solves the Whittaker SDEs.

Here, since Wr = 0 e−v/2 dv (Bet+v − Bet ) is a standard Brownian

a standard result of linear SDEs [17, the last paragraph of p.354].
(1◦ ). First, we prove that the limit in (2.6) exists almost surely. It suffices to show that the
stochastic integral in (2.8) with t + s = 0 converges almost surely as t → −∞. First, note that

The last equality is enough for (2.7). We have proved (1◦ ).

defined by (2.7) satisfies both (1.1) and (2.6). The proof is complete.

Since AL = A↾(TL × TL ) for all L, we can construct stochastic integral parts of solutions of
the Whittaker SDEs on TL for all L ≥ 3 simultaneously from an infinite-dimensional standard
Brownian motion {Bt (a); a ∈ T∞ }. This extension defines an infinite-dimensional Gaussian
process {ζt (a); a ∈ T∞ } such that for a ∈ TL , ζt (a) equals the sum in (2.7). In this case, AL
and TL in the sum can be replaced by A and T∞ , respectively.
In the rest of this paper, we study the rescaled limits of {ζt (a); a ∈ T∞ } at the
process level, not just the rescaled limits of their marginal distributions.

Representation by independent sums

In this subsection, we discuss a probabilistic representation of the Markovian semigroup (etA ; t ≥
0) in terms of sums of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. This representation uses two sets of
ingredients defined as follows.
First, define a sum function Σ : Z2+ → T∞ and a difference function ∆ : T∞ → Z2+ by
def

Σ : (m1 , m2 ) 7→ (Σ1 (m1 , m2 ), Σ2 (m1 , m2 )) = (m1 + 1, m1 + m2 + 1),
def

∆ : (a1 , a2 ) 7→ (∆1 (a1 , a2 ), ∆2 (a1 , a2 )) = (a1 − 1, a2 − a1 ).

(2.12)
(2.13)

The map Σ is bijective with ∆ being its inverse. (We abuse notation a bit since ∆ has been
used to denote the Laplacian in the context of SPDEs.) For the following result, see the proof
of [7, Lemma 5.7].
Lemma 2.2. The Markov chain with generator A can be represented as ΣD. Here, D =
(D (1) , D (2) ), and D (1) and D (2) are independent linear pure death chains on Z+ such that
k → k − 1 with rate k, for any k ∈ Z+ .
Proof. A jump in D (1) changes ΣD = (Σ1 D, Σ2 D) to (Σ1 D − 1, Σ2 D − 1) with rate D (1) =
Σ1 D − 1. Similarly, a jump in D (2) changes ΣD = (Σ1 D, Σ2 D) to (Σ1 D, Σ2 D − 1) with rate
D (2) = Σ2 D − Σ1 D. These rates recover the entries of A.

To introduce the second set of ingredients, we write Sm (p) for a binomial random variable
with parameters m ∈ Z+ and p ∈ [0, 1]. Then take a sequence of i.i.d. exponential variables
{en } under P and represent the binomial random variables explicitly as
−t

t ∈ [0, ∞],

(2.14)

P
with the convention that 0n=1 ≡ 0. We let e−t parametrize Sm since E[1(t,∞) (en )] = e−t . The
independent sum in (2.14) is applied in the form that, as processes with càdlàg paths,

(2.15)

for any deterministic initial condition D0 ∈ Z+ . Recall that this probabilistic representation
follows because memorylessness of exponential random variables supplies the Markov property
and the property that en ’s are independent with E[en ] = 1 gives the linear death rates. See
[23, Section 6.2.1, pp.287–290].
The probabilistic representation of (etA ) is now defined as follows: By Lemma 2.2, the
identity ∆Σ = Id and (2.15), we have
∀ a, b ∈ T∞ ,

etA (a, b) = P(ΣDt = b|ΣD0 = a)
= P(Dt = ∆b|D0 = ∆a)


= P S∆1 a (e−t ) = ∆1 b P S∆2 a (e−t ) = ∆2 b .

(2.16)

By (2.16), the pure death processes D j and the independent sums Sm (e−t ) furnish a probabilistic
representation of the solutions of the Whittaker SDEs. For this reason, we view these auxiliary
random elements as being defined on a probability space, with probability P and expectation
E, separate from the probability space for the Whittaker SDEs.
Remark 2.3. Alternatively, the reader may choose to think of the Brownian motions B(a)’s
collectively as the “random environment” driving the Whittaker SDEs. In this case, all the
random elements need to be defined on the same probability space.

We close this section with an immediate application of (2.16), which is the starting point of
the next section. From now on, write ζΣ(m1 , m2 ) for the value of ζ : T∞ → R at Σ(m1 , m2 ) ∈
Z2 , S ′ for an independent copy of the process S defined by (2.14), and Cov[U; V ] = E[UV ] −
E[U]E[V ] for random variables U and V .
Proposition 2.4. The mean-zero Gaussian process {ζt (a); a ∈ T∞ } defined below Proposition 2.1 has a covariance function satisfying the following probabilistic representation:

Rescaled limit of the covariance function

In this section, we prove convergence of the covariance function in (2.17) and quantify the error
bounds for the forthcoming applications to tightness of the fluctuation of the Whittaker SDEs.
First, the rescaling can be chosen from the central limit theorem if we consider the probabilities in (2.17). Write

for x, y ∈ R2 and 0 ≤ s ≤ t < ∞. Notice that the integral representation in (3.8) corresponds
to the “ideal case” discussed above for (3.1). If r, s, t are fixed such that σj (r) 6= 0, the above
view for the probability in (3.1) applies to the integrand in the form of the local central limit
theorem. But due to the integral nature of the covariance function, we cannot neglect the
contribution of r ≈ 0 as N → ∞. This is where the local central limit theorem can break
down. A similar issue arises if r ≈ s = t under (3.8). Poisson approximations will apply
over these two ranges of r. The integral representation in (3.7) is suitable for this purpose.
Nevertheless, the central issue is the slow decorrelation.

Remark 3.1 (Edwards–Wilkinson scaling). In terms of the above approximations, the
covariance function in (3.7) has a natural generalization in other spatial dimensions d:

That is, introducing the factor N 2 enables the application of the local central limit theorem.
Accordingly, one could consider generalizations of the Whittaker SDEs to other spatial dimensions, starting with multi-dimensional generalizations of the triangular lattices TN . We do not
pursue these generalizations here. On the other hand, the foregoing display suggests that the
rescaled process ζ N defined in (3.6) can be seen as

The following theorem summarizes the results of this section. Here and in what follows,
we write V (λ) and V ′ (λ′ ) for independent Poisson random variables with means λ and λ′ ,
respectively. Also, (Qt ) stands for the probability semigroup of the two-dimensional standard
Brownian motion.

Theorem 3.2 combines the more detailed results, Theorems 3.13 and 3.20, to be proven in
the rest of this section.

(2◦ ). We recall once again that various rescaled limits of the covariance functions are already
obtained in [7]. See [7, Theorem 5.9, Proposition 5.28, and Proposition 5.29] in particular.
Whereas the first two results of this list are stated as complex contour integrals, [7, Proposition 5.29] appears to be similar to Theorem 3.2. These two results can be compared as follows.
By a scaling of time and (2.17), that limit from [7] can be restated as

space and terms of the order O(N 1/2 ), among several other differences. See also [7, Remark
5.30, and Corollary 5.31] for results related to [7, Proposition 5.29].

For the proofs of Theorems 3.13 and 3.20, we apply two schemes of integration which
formalize the consideration below (3.8): For 0 < ℓN < rN < 1 and 0 < τN < 1, we subdivide
r ∈ [0, s] into the following three intervals:
r ∈ [0, sℓN ], r ∈ [sℓN , srN ], and r ∈ [srN , s]
13

if 0 ≤ t − s ≤ τN ,

(3.13)

or into the following two intervals:
r ∈ [0, sℓN ] and r ∈ [sℓN , s]

if t − s > τN .

(3.14)

We use the notation in (3.12). Then under (3.13), we work with the following decomposition:

Assumption 3.4. Fix η ∈ (0, 1/2). For all integers N ≥ 16, set ℓN = 1 − rN = τN =
N −(1/2+η) .

Lastly, we introduce some conditions on x1 , x2 , y1, y2 , s, t, N for the forthcoming proofs.
Definition 3.5. Fix 0 < T0 < 1 < T1 < ∞ and let η ∈ (0, 1/2) be the constant fixed in
Assumption 3.4. The primary condition (over [T 0 ,T 1 ]) refers to the following condition:

 (x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 ) : x1 , x2 , y1, y2 ∈ [− 12 N η , 21 N η ];
(s, t) : T0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T1 ;
(3.17)

N : N ∋ N ≥ 16, ⌊ 12 T0 N 1/2−η ⌋ ≥ 1.

The secondary condition (over [T 0 ,T 1 ]) refers to the following condition:
(x1 , x2 , y1, y2 ): |x1 − y1 | ∧ |x2 − y2 | ≥

4
N −1/2 .
T0

(3.18)

Remark 3.6. Given η ∈ (0, 1/2), the primary condition has two simple implications: First,
⌊ 12 T0 N⌋ ≤ Mj , Mj′ ≤ ⌊ 23 T1 N⌋, for Mj , Mj′ defined in (3.2). These bounds follow from the choice
of xj , yj , s, t. Second, the lower bound of Mj , Mj′ and the choice of N imply Mj , Mj′ ≥ 1.

The secondary condition will be used only in the proofs of Proposition 3.12 (4◦ ) and Theorem 4.3. (The proof of Proposition 5.2 uses a variation of this condition.) From now on,
whenever either of the two conditions in Definition 3.5 is in use, Assumption 3.4
is imposed automatically.

dTV (µ1 ⊗ µ2 , ν1 ⊗ ν2 ) ≤ dTV (µ1 , ν1 ) + dTV (µ2 , ν2 )

measures µ, ν on Z, where h ranges over all functions such that khk∞ ≤ 1 [11, (7.2) on p.221].

Since Assumption 3.4 is in force, these integrals converge to zero as N → ∞.
In the context of Proposition 3.8 (which is under the primary condition, and hence, under
Assumption 3.4), its first inequality gives an estimate of the first integral in (3.19). To calculate
the limit of this integral of Poisson probabilities, note that NsℓN → ∞ for s > 0, and we need
to pass the limit of the Poisson probabilities under the integral sign. For (3.19), the additional
assumption 0 ≤ t − s ≤ τN yields an estimate by the integral of Poisson probabilities from the
second inequality of Proposition 3.8. This integral can be written as

where N(s − srN ) → ∞ for s > 0. In this case, lim inf N inf (s,t) |Mj − Mj′ |/N 1/2 > 0 for fixed
xj 6= yj , where (s, t) ranges over all the pairs satisfying the standing assumptions. Also, with
r in the range of integration, the parameters of V and V ′ in (3.27) are o(N 1/2 ). Hence, by
scaling, the probability indexed by j in (3.27) is zero in the limit for each j.
We use the next three lemmas to pass limits for the first integral of Poisson probabilities
from Proposition 3.8 and the one in (3.27) in the manner mentioned above. The first and
the last of these lemmas consider the property that due to the infinite divisibility, the Poisson
distributions with large parameters are eligible for normal approximations. For the local central

by normal approximations. Here and in what follows, recall the notation in (3.12) for binomial
probabilities. Let us begin with the following elementary result. For a Bernoulli random variable

def 
β(p) with mean p, we set ψp (u) = E eiuβ(p) = peiu(1−p) + (1 − p)e−iup , where β(p) = β(p) − p.
Lemma 3.14. It holds that

|ψp (u)|2 = 1 − 2p(1 − p)(1 − cos u),
sup sup |ψp (u) − 1| < 1.

∀ p ∈ (0, 1), u ∈ R;

(3.52)
(3.53)

p∈(0,1) u:|u|≤1

Proof. For (3.53), note that |ψp (u) − 1| ≤ p|eiu(1−p) − 1| + (1 − p)|e−iup − 1|, u 7→ |eiu − 1|2 =
2 − 2 cos u is strictly increasing on [0, π], and |eiπ/3 − 1| = 1.

The next step is a counterpart of Lemma 3.7 in the context of normal approximations. Recall
the notation in (3.28) for Gaussian densities. Note that the next lemma is not the binomial
local central limit theorem (the de Moivre–Laplace theorem), and the forthcoming application
needs the sum form (3.54) of σ 2 for the bound in (3.55). See also Remark 3.16.

The required bound in (3.55) then follows upon applying (3.63) and (3.64), to be proven below,
to (3.57).

as |ez1 − ez2 | and bound this difference in the way of (3.33). This use of (3.33) is legitimate
since we can take the logarithms of ψq (θ/N 1/2 ) and ψq′ (−θ/N 1/2 ) by (3.53).
Step 1-1. To bound the term corresponding to max{|ez1 |, |ez2 |} in (3.33), we use (3.52) and
the inequality 1 − v ≤ e−v for all v ≥ 0. They give

where the last inequality holds whenever |θ| ≤ N 1/2 since cos v − 1 + v 2 /5 ≤ 0 for |v| ≤ 1.
Plainly, the same bound with (q, M) replaced by (q ′ , M ′ ) on both sides holds.
Step 1-2. Next, for (3.58), we bound the term corresponding to |z1 − z2 | in (3.33). We expand
κ(iu) = Log ψp (u) for u ∈ R around 0, where κ denotes the cumulant of β(p). We have κ(0)=0.
Also, by definition, β(p) has a zero mean and variance p(1 − p), and so the first two derivatives
of u 7→ κ(iu) at u = 0 are given by 0 and i2 p(1 − p), respectively.
The next bound is for the third-order derivative of u 7→ κ(iu). It is chosen to incorporate the
parameters of the Bernoulli random variables: Observe that (d/du)κ(iu) = E[iβ(p)eiuβ(p) ]/E[eiuβ(p) ].
This expression implies that every higher-order derivative is a ratio where the denominator
is a power of ψp (u) and the numerator is a sum of products of expectations of the form
±E[(iβ(p))ℓ eiuβ(p) ]. Each product carries at least one such expectation with ℓ ≥ 1 and so
can be bounded by E[|β(p)|] = 2p(1 − p). Hence, by (3.53),
sup

∀ p ∈ (0, 1).

Up to this point, we have proved that

2

∀ |u| ≤ 1, p ∈ (0, 1).

(3.61)

We remark that the factor p(1 − p) in the bound of (3.61) will be useful.
Now, an application of the definition (3.54) of σ 2 and (3.61) shows that the term |z1 − z2 |
in (3.33) for bounding (3.58) satisfies

Remark 3.16. The proofs of Lemmas 3.9 and 3.15 extend the methods in [16, Chapters XV
and XVI] for proving the local central limit theorem of general lattice distributions. Here, we
rely on the explicit forms of the characteristic functions to get the rates of convergence. Besides,

′
′
in contrast to (3.31), we decompose the Fourier integral for N 1/2 P SM (q) = SM
into
′ (q ) + a
two parts in (3.57). This validates (3.61) since ψ1/2 (π) = 0 by (3.52). On the other hand,
although it is not clear to us whether (3.31) can be deduced from the known existing results,
[21, Theorem 9] proves the rate of convergence for sums of i.i.d. general lattice-valued random
variables (also by the Fourier analytic method). It may be possible to extend the proof in [21]
to (3.55) by elaborating its use of the absolute third moments of the random variables in the
Fourier integral decomposition. See also [27, Section 1] for a general discussion for such rates.

The next proposition proves integrated normal approximations for the integrals in (3.51).
Proposition 3.17. Fix 0 < T0 < 1 < T1 < ∞, and assume the primary condition (3.17).

(3.65)

(2◦ ) If we add the condition t − s > τN to the supremum in (3.65) and change the upper limit
srN of the integral on the left-hand side to s, then the same bound holds.
(3◦ ) The suprema in (1◦ ) and (2◦ ) tend to zero as N → ∞ for all x, y ∈ R2 .
Proof. Recall the quantities σj (r; N) ≥ 0 and σj (r) ≥ 0 defined in (3.4) and (3.5). We
write Ij (r; N) for the right-hand side of (3.56), j ∈ {1, 2}, and define σ(q) ≥ 0 by σ(q)2 =
min{σj (sq; N)2 , σj (sq)2 ; 1 ≤ j ≤ 2}. We stress that σ(q) still depends on s and t.
For the proof of the proposition, we consider the following four integrals for every choice of
(L, R) such that 0 < L ≤ 1/2 ≤ R ≤ 1:
Z sR

The proof of (1◦ ) below chooses (L, R) to be (ℓN , 1/2) and (1/2, rN ). The sum of the corresponding eight integrals from (3.66) bounds the integral in (1◦ ). For the proof of (2◦ ), the
integral can be bounded in the same way by using (ℓN , 1/2) and (1/2, 1).
Let us simplify the task of bounding the sum of the four integrals in (3.66) by making some
observations. First, using the explicit form of Ij (r; N) and changing variable r to q = r/s, we
can bound the sum of the first three integrals in (3.66) by the sum of the following integrals
up to a multiplicative constant C(T0 , T1 ) > 0:

where α(q) = 1/(N 1/2 σ(q)2 ) and σ(q) (depending on s and t) is as defined at the beginning
of the proof. Also, to bound the last integral in (3.66), we use Lemma 3.10 and the estimates
|σj (sq; N)2 − σj (sq)2 | ≤ 2/N and |µj (sq; N) − µj (sq)| ≤ 2/N 1/2 , which gives

By the preceding considerations, we focus on the integrals in (3.67) and (3.68), with L and R
to be specified, in the rest of the proof.

(1◦ ). We give the proof according to the decomposition sℓNN = sℓN + s/2N of the integral under
consideration. We first consider the case L = ℓN and R = 1/2 for the setup above. In view
of the contribution of (Mj /N)(r/s)(1 − r/s) in σj2 (r; N) and σj2 (r) and the change of variable
q = r/s, the following bound for σ(q)2 holds:
σ(q)2 ≥ C(T0 , T1 )q,

∀ q ∈ (0, 1/2].

(3.69)

(The primary condition (3.17) is used to get this bound and the analogues (3.70) and (3.71)
below.) Hence, by (3.67) and (3.68),

Note that these bounds are for integrals of functions exploding at q = 0.
For the second case, we take L = 1/2 and R = rN = 1 − ℓN . The lower bound for σ(q)2 is
now taken to be
σ(q)2 ≥ C(T0 , T1 )(1 − q),

∀ q ∈ [1/2, 1).

(3.70)

In this case, the singularities in the integrals from (3.67) and (3.68) are changed to q = 1.
However, since ℓN = 1 − rN , a change of variable with 1 − q replaced by q shows that the
bounds in the above case apply. Putting together the bounds in the two cases yields (1◦ ).
Rs
R s/2 R s
(2◦ ). We use the decomposition sℓN = sℓN + s/2 of the integral under consideration. The
R s/2
same argument for sℓN in the proof of (1◦ ) applies in this case.
We change the argument for the second case in Step 1 by taking t − s > τN , L = 1/2 and
R = 1. By considering 1 − sq/t = [t − s + s(1 − q)]/t in bounding (Mj′ /N)(r/t)(1 − r/t), the
lower bound in (3.70) is replaced by
σ(q)2 ≥ C(T0 , T1 )[τN + (1 − q)],
27

∀ q ∈ [1/2, 1).

(3.71)

Hence, with a translation of (1 − q) by τN in the domains of integration, we can still use the
bounds for the second case in the proof of (1◦ ), except that ℓN is replaced by τN . Since τN = ℓN
by assumption, we have proved (2◦ ).

(3◦ ). The required limits hold under Assumption 3.4. The proof is complete.
Finally, we pass limit under the integral sign by the following proposition. Note that the
first integral in (3.73) converges absolutely by the inequality 1 − e−v ≤ v for all v ≥ 0.
Proposition 3.18. Let Assumption 3.4 be in force.
(1◦ ) Let 0 < s ≤ t < ∞ and x, y ∈ R2 be such that either s < t or x 6= y. Then for 1/2 < reN ≤ 1
with reN → 1, it holds that

Convergence to the additive stochastic heat equation

In this section, we relate the limiting covariance function in Theorem 3.2 to the covariance
function of an additive stochastic heat equation. Whereas some of these connections are already
pointed out in [7], we proceed with the weak formulation.
From now on, S(R2 ) denotes the space of real-valued Schwartz functions on R2 and S ′ (R2 )
denotes the space of bounded linear functionals on S(R2 ) over R. By convention, S ′ (R2 ) is
equipped with the weak topology [25].

4.1

Weak formulations

With respect to the process ζ N (x, s) in (3.6), we define
Z
N
ζs (φ) =
φ(x)ζ N (x, s)dx,
x≥−N 1/2 1

φ ∈ S(R2 ).

(4.1)

Here, 1 = (1, 1). The constraint x ≥ −N 1/2 1 is maximal for using the Whittaker SDEs since
for any s > 0, M(xj , s) ≥ 0 if and only if xj ≥ −N 1/2 . (Recall (3.3) for the notation M(xj , s).)
In this subsection, we show some basic growth properties of the process ζ N (x, s) and then
translate Theorem 3.2 to a convergence result under the weak formulation.
By Proposition 2.4, the metric induced by the covariance function of ζs Σ(m1 , m2 ) can be
represented as follows: for every (m1 , m2 ), (m′1 , m′2 ) ∈ Z2+ and 0 ≤ s ≤ t < ∞,
E[|ζs Σ(m1 , m2 ) − ζt Σ(m′1 , m′2 )|2 ]

Next, we show that (4.3) implies (4.4). In the case s = 0 or m1 = m2 = 0, the required
bound holds obviously, since then the second and third terms on the right-hand side of (4.2)
with (m′1 , m′2 ) = (m1 , m2 ) are zero. For 0 < s ≤ t < ∞ and nonzero (m1 , m2 ) ∈ Z2+ , (4.3)
implies the following bound for the second term in (4.2) with (m′1 , m′2 ) = (m1 , m2 ):

The third term in (4.2) with (m′1 , m′2 ) = (m1 , m2 ) can be bounded similarly. Hence, (4.4) holds
whenever 0 < s ≤ t < ∞ and (m1 , m2 ) is nonzero. We have proved (4.4).

As an application, we obtain the a.s. polynomial growth of ζ in the following lemma.

converges absolutely for all s ∈ [0, ∞) and φ ∈ S(R2 ), and ζ N takes values in D(R+ , S ′ (R2 )).
Proof. (1◦ ). We modify the proof of [12, Proposition 4.1] as follows. For any integer n ≥ 1,
set En = {(m1 , m2 ) ∈ Z2+ ; 2n−1 ≤ k(m1 , m2 )k∞ < 2n }. For any β ∈ (0, ∞) and α ∈ (1, ∞),

Since ζ is a Gaussian process, Lemma 4.1 (2◦ ) is enough for the application of Kolmogorov’s theorem of continuity [26, (2.1)Theorem in Chapter I]. Moreover, we can find C ′ (α, T ), C(α) such
C(α)
that the expected supremum in (4.5) indexed by (m1 , m2 ) is bounded by C ′ (α, T )k(m1, m2 )k∞ .
We get the required result upon setting β = 3 + C(α) in (4.5).
(2◦ ). For xj ≥ −N 1/2 , s 7→ sN + sN · xj /N 1/2 is nondecreasing on [0, ∞) and so s 7→ Mj is
càdlàg. For these xj ’s, we also have 0 ≤ Mj ≤ Ns + Ns · |xj |/N 1/2 . Hence, by (1◦ ), ζsN (φ) is
absolutely convergent as an integral, for any s, and is càdlàg in s. The weak topology of S ′ (R2 )
gives the required path property of ζ N .

Now we extend Theorem 3.2 to a convergence under the weak formulation.

Proof. First, we state a preliminary bound by summarizing those in Propositions 3.8, 3.12,
3.17 and 3.18 via (3.15) and (3.16): Fix 0 < T0 < 1 < T1 < ∞. Let the primary condition

We show the main term of the required limit. First, recall that Theorem 3.2 is obtained by
summing the limits in Theorems 3.13 and 3.20. Next, we shift the integrand of the integral in
(3.7) by 1[1,∞)(r)/(4πr) (as in Theorem 3.13) and define an integral IN (x, y; s, t) accordingly.
Let GN denote the set of (x, y) that
R satisfies the assumption for (4.7). By dominated convergence, we can pass the limit limN GN IN (x, y; s, t)φ1(x)φ2 (y)dxdy under the integral sign. The
limit is given by the right-hand
side of (4.6).

It remains to show G∁ IN (x, y; s, t)φ1(x)φ2 (y)dxdy → 0. We consider two cases. To handle

the integral overR(x, y) that fails to satisfy the primary condition (3.17), note that for any p > 0
and φ ∈ S(R2 ), ([−N η /2,N η /2]2 )∁ |φ(x)|dx ≤ C(η, p, φ)N −p . Next, let BN denote the set of (x, y)
that fails the secondary condition (3.18). Recall that the secondary condition is only required
in Proposition 3.12 (4◦ ) in getting (4.7). Then it is enough to note that for that integral in

X0 as a centered Gaussian random field indexed by S0 (R ) = {φ ∈ S(R ); φ = 0}. See
[19] and the references therein for a reproducing kernel approach of the construction of X0 .
Alternatively, X0 can
R 0 be
R defined as the stationary solution of the additive stochastic heat
equation: X0 (φ) = −∞ R2 Q−r φ(x)W (dx, dr), which converges a.s. See Section 6.
Given the conditionally positive definiteness of (x, y) 7→ − ln |x − y|, the relation in (4.10)
cannot apply on the full space S(R2 ). To avoid unnecessary

the limiting process in (4.11) to the following S ′ (R2 )-valued continuous process:

Here, X0 [Qt Rφ], and hence, the process X are well-defined since the Lebesgue measure is
an invariant measure of (Qt ). Note that for φ ∈ S0 (R2 ), this Xt (φ) still satisfies (4.8). (For
example, [28, 5◦ in the proof of Theorem 2.1 on page 430] allows for a straightforward extension
beyond one dimension to this case.) By (4.11), it holds that for all φ1 , φ2 ∈ S(R2 ) and 0 < s ≤

lim Cov[ζsN ◦ R(φ1 ); ζtN ◦ R(φ2 )] = Cov[Xs−1 (φ1 ); Xt−1 (φ2 )].

Theorem 4.5. As N → ∞, the sequence of laws of (ζtN ◦ R; t > 0) converges weakly to the law
of (Xt−1 ; t > 0) as probability measures on D((0, ∞), S ′(R2 )), where X is defined by (4.12).
For the proof of this theorem, the convergence of finite-dimensional marginals follows readily
from (4.13). To obtain the convergence at the process level, Mitoma’s theorem [20] requires
the tightness of ζ N (φ) for all fixed φ ∈ S0 (R2 ). The proof of this property is the subject of the
next section.

Tightness of the rescaled Whittaker SDEs

Our goal in this section is to prove that the family of laws of the continuous Gaussian processes ζ N (φ) defined by (4.1) is tight, for a fixed φ ∈ S0 (R2 ). It is enough to show that
(s, t) 7→ E[|ζsN (φ) − ζtN (φ)|2 ] are uniformly Hölder continuous on compacts. The major argument appears in the proof of Lemma 5.5, where several exact identities are introduced to cancel
new divergent terms. Throughout this section, we continue to use the notations in (3.12) for
binomial probabilities.
Consider the explicit expressions of these metrics by applying the rescaling under consideration. Recall (3.6), (3.8) and (4.1). By (4.2), we have
E[|ζsN (φ) − ζtN (φ)|2 ] = IN (s, t) − JN (s, t) − KN (s, t),

Then the job is to show that each of the three terms on the right-hand side of (5.1) satisfies
the following property for some α ∈ (0, 1]:

(5.2)

The results are presented as Propositions 5.2, 5.6, and 5.7 below. The use of uniform Hölder
continuity is only for IN ; the other two functions are uniformly Lipschitz.
Notation 5.1. Write j∗ for the coordinate in {1, 2} different from j ∈ {1, 2}.



Proposition 5.2. (5.2) is satisfied by LN = IN for α = 1/2.
Proof. We bound the integrand of IN (s, t), for r ∈ [s, t], according to r/t ≥ 1 − (1/2)N −1/2
and the complementary case. The point here is that since r is bounded away from zero, we do
not need to deal with divergent re-centering constants as in Section 3.
Step 1. First, we assume the primary condition (3.17) and
r ∈ [s, t] such that r/t ≥ 1 − (1/2)N −1/2 .

Step 2. We assume the primary condition (3.17) and the complementary case of (5.3):
r ∈ [s, t] such that 1 − r/t > (1/2)N −1/2 .

(5.7)

Then C(T0 , T1 ) ≤ N 1/2 σj (r; N)2 for all j ∈ {1, 2} (recall (3.4)). Furthermore, if
|xj − yj | ≥ (4/T0 )N −1/2

for fixed j ∈ {1, 2},

(5.8)

then |M(xj , t)−M(yj , t)| ≥ C(T0 , T1 )N 1/2 |xj −yj | by (5.5). Hence, under the primary condition
(3.17), (5.7) and (5.8), Lemma 3.15 gives

bN,j (xj , yj ; r, t, t) ≤ g σj (r; N)2 ; C(T0 , T1 )(xj − yj ) + C ′ (T0 , T1 ).

where the definition of τ3 uses Notation 5.1. Let us explain how these six terms arise from
bounding |IN (s, t)|. First, τ1 follows from (5.6). We get τ2 from (5.9) by enforcing (5.8) for
all j ∈ {1, 2}, whereas τ3 follows from (5.9) under (5.8) for exactly one j ∈ {1, 2}. Then we
need τ4 when (5.8) fails for all j ∈ {1, 2}. Now that τ1 , τ2 , τ3 , τ4 are obtained by assuming the
primary condition, τ5 , τ6 handle the failure of the primary condition.
We are ready to prove the required uniform Hölder continuity. It is immediate that

By Corollary 4.4, the first term in the foregoing equality is bounded by C(T0 , T1 , φ)|t − s|. The
second term can be bounded in the same way since the assumption φ ∈ S0 (R2 ) enables the

cancellation of ln(N

For the remaining terms in (5.13) for JN , we first state some elementary results.

Lemma 5.5. (5.2) is satisfied by LN = −JN,2 + JN,3 for α = 1.
Proof. We divide the proof into a few steps. Step 1 is for JN,2 , whereas we need Steps 2,
2-1–2-2 to handle JN,3 . A summary is given in Step 3 to complete the proof.
Step 1. According to (y + N 1/2 1) · ∇φ(y) = y · ∇φ(y) + N 1/2 divφ(y), we can write
JN,2 (s, t) = JN,2,1(s, t) + JN,2,2 (s, t).

for LN = JN,2,1 and α = 1 holds. We handle JN,2,2(s, t) in Step 3.
In the rest of this proof, we write RN,j = RN,j (xj∗ , yj∗ ; r, s, v) for a function such that

−N 1/2

In more detail for (5.21), the binomial probabilities in aN,3,j,2 differ slightly from those in
′
Corollary 4.4 since those in aN,3,j,2 are for events of the form {Sm + 1 = Sm
′ } rather than {Sm =
′
Sm
′ }. However, the proof of the corollary relies on the bounds obtained in Sections 3.1 and 3.2,
and these bounds carry over to the present case after slight modifications: See the algebra of
Step 3 of the proof of Proposition 3.12 up to (3.48). The other changes are straightforward.
Step 4. In this step, we consider the set of integrals in (5.20) with k = 1. In contrast to aN,3,j,2,
each of the two terms defining aN,3,j,1 as a difference is of a larger order in N. We aim to let
aN,3,j,1 (after appropriate integrations according to (5.19)) and JN,2,2 (still unsettled) cancel
each other. Then the task is to get an estimate of aN,3,j,1 that can be used to match JN,2,2 .
We begin by simplifying the integrals in (5.20) with k = 1, in view of the property that there
are additional ±1 in the numbers of summands in the random sums defining aN,3,j,1. These
unwanted integers can be removed by using Lemma 5.4 (3◦ ) to translate variables:

(5.22)

(5.23)

Let us explain (5.23). The two terms defining the right-hand side of (5.22) as a difference
are not the same only for the integrations with respect to yj , and they share the same binomial
e
probability. So we extract a discrete partial derivative [φ(y) − φ(y − vN j1/2 )]vN 1/2 from this
difference, as shown in (5.23). Additionally, in (5.23), RN,j arises from taking the difference of
the ranges of yj in (5.22) and using the fast decay property of φ.
In the rest of Step 4, we show that the first term in (5.23) can be used to cancel JN,2,2
left unsettled in Step 1. The plan is to reduce this term in (5.23) to an integral showing only
′
binomial probabilities of the form P(Sm = Sm
′ ), now that these probabilities enter JN,2,2 .
To this end, we apply the higher-order expansion (5.15), and then we remove +2 and +1 in
the numbers of summands on the right-hand side of (5.15) by changing variables according to
Lemma 5.4 (3◦ ). (The latter is similar to how we obtain (5.22).)
In Steps 4-1 and 4-2 below, we consider (5.23) for 1 > r/s ≥ 1/2 and r/s < 1/2 separately.
Step 4-1. We restrict our attention to r such that 1 > r/s ≥ 1/2. This condition on r is used
to bound away from zero the denominators (r/s)2 in aN,3,j,1,k defined below.

from zero. The fast decay property of φ is also used.
Let us approximate φN and show two more RN,j -terms in (5.29). First, note that ∂xj φ ∈
S(R2 ), and the sum of the coefficients of the expectations in (5.15) is 1. By these properties,
(3.42) and r/s ≥ 1/2, an approximation of φN by φ with an O(1/N 1/2 )-error holds:
C(T0 , T1 , φ, n)

Next, to get the two RN,j -terms, we first use the mean-zero property, dy[φ(y)−φ(y− vN j1/2 )] =
0. So the first term in (5.29) is not changed after we subtract 1[1,∞) (r)/(4πr). Then we apply

Corollary 4.4 to this re-centered term: Replacing φN by φN results in an RN,j -term, thanks to

the bounds for φN in (5.30). We get another RN,j -term from replacing [φ(y)−φ(y− vN 1/2
with ∂yj φ(y), since their difference can be bounded uniformly in v ∈ [s, t] and T0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T1

in the same way as φN .
Our conclusion of Step 4-1 is as follows. By the observations in the last paragraph, (5.29),
and (5.30), the following estimate holds for all r and v such that r/s ≥ 1/2 and s ≤ v ≤ t:
Z ∞

Step 4-2. For the case r/s < 1/2 complementary to that considered in Step 4-1, we turn to
′
′
(3.26) to change parameters of Sm (p) and Sm
′ (p ) and consider probabilities of Sm (1 − p) and
′
′
Sm
′ (1 − p ) alternatively. This replacement is reversible. In this way, the argument from (5.25)
to (5.29) applies similarly.
In more detail, the modification of Step 4-1 begins with the following replacement for (5.23)
from using (3.26):
 r 

Then we modify Fe in (5.24) such that the binomial probability is replaced by

The condition r/s < 1/2 ensures that the denominators in the analogues of aN,3,j,1,k satisfy
(1 − r/v)2 ≥ (1/2)2 for all s ≤ v ≤ t. In the corresponding analogue of (5.29), we reverse the
replacements by writing

Hence, for the present case, we have the same estimate in (5.31), except that the applicable r
and v now have to satisfy r/s < 1/2 and s ≤ v ≤ t.
Step 5. Finally, we apply (5.21), (5.31), and the analogue of (5.31) from Step 4-2 to the sum
over j ∈ {1, 2} in (5.19). Since divφ(y) = ∂y1 φ(y) + ∂y2 φ(y), it follows that
e N (s, t),
JN,3(s, t) = JN,2,2 (s, t) + R

last paragraph before Step 2. By (5.17) and the validity of (5.2) for LN = JN,2,1 and α = 1
from Step 1, (5.34) is enough for the proof of the lemma.

By (5.13), Lemmas 5.3 and 5.5 can be summarized as the following proposition.

Proposition 5.6. (5.2) for LN = JN and α = 1 holds.
The same result holds for KN by an almost identical argument if we restart from (5.11). We
omit the details.
Proposition 5.7. (5.2) for LN = KN and α = 1 holds.

Stationary additive stochastic heat equation

In this section, we collect some basic results for the stationary additive stochastic heat equation
which are mentioned in Section 4, since they seem difficult to find in the literature.
Let W be a two-sided space-time white noise. For any φ ∈ L2 (R2 , dx), W (φ) is a two-sided
Brownian motion with W0 (φ) = 0 and E[W1 (φ)2 ] = E[W−1 (φ)2 ] = kφk2L2(R2 ,dx) . An inspection
of the proof of Proposition 3.18, especially (3.79), shows that, without the re-centering function,
we would obtain the following divergent integral instead of the first integral in (3.9):

The process in (6.1) is an analogue of the classical stationary solution of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck
process. The next proposition shows that it is well-defined whenever φ ∈ S0 (R2 ).

Proposition 6.1. For every φ ∈ S0 (R2 ), the improper stochastic integral in (6.1) converges
a.s. for any fixed t ≥ 0 and, as a process, has the same finite-dimensional marginals as X(φ)
defined by (4.12). In particular, (Xt ; t ≥ 0) as an S ′ (R2 )-valued process is stationary.
e note that, for −∞ < −S ≤ −T ≤ 0 ≤ t < ∞,

by dominated convergence since φ ∈ S0 (R2 ) and 1 − e−u ≤ u for all u ≥ 0. The improper

convergence theorem as in the proof of Proposition 2.1.

To see that X(φ) and X(φ)
have the same finite-dimensional marginals, we use Lemma 3.19

where in the second equality, we use Lemma 3.19, the assumption φ ∈ S0 (R2 ), and the domies (φ); X

nated convergence theorem. The last equality shows that Cov[Xs (φ); Xt (φ)] = Cov[X
which is enough for the required identity in finite-dimensional marginals.
Finally, given φ1 , φ2 ∈ S0 (R2 ), Cov[Xt (φ1 ); Xt (φ2 )] is given by (6.2) with φ(x)φ(y) replaced
by φ1 (x)φ2 (y). Hence, Cov[Xt (φ1 ); Xt (φ2 )] does not depend on t. This proves the stationarity
of X.
