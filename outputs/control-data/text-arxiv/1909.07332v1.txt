Abstract
High charge mobility in active layers of organic electronic devices is often necessary for their efficient
operation. As a result, search for high-mobility materials among the plethora of synthesizable organic
semiconductors is of paramount importance for organic electronics. However, a model for rapid but
reliable prediction of charge mobility in various organic semiconductors is still lacking. To solve this issue,
we propose a simple analytical model that considers the most essential factors governing the charge
transport in these materials: intermolecular electronic coupling, charge delocalization, electron-phonon
interaction, and static and dynamic disorder. The suggested model efficiently predicts charge mobility for
organic semiconductors of various chemical structures and sizes, and significantly outperforms another
approach usually used for screening of organic semiconductors, - Marcus model, - which overlooks highmobility materials possessing small conjugated cores. We thus anticipate that the suggested model is an
efficient tool for the search of the high-mobility organic semiconductors, and its possible integration with
crystal structure prediction can boost the development of organic electronics.

1. Introduction
Organic electronics provides an opportunity for production of (opto)electronic devices that can
outperform their inorganic counterparts in many applications. For instance, light-emitting diodes, lightemitting transistors and lasers with desired emission wavelength,1 sensors with high specificity to the
external stimuli,2,3 photodiodes and organic solar cells with various absorption spectra and photovoltaic
properties4 can be designed. The tunability of the organic electronic devices’ properties is provided by the
ability to choose the organic semiconductors (OSs) for their active layers from a plethora of synthesizable
compounds, which is virtually unlimited.5,6 In most cases, efficient operation of the organic electronic
devices, e.g., organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), requires OSs with high charge mobility, μ, and hence
search of the high-mobility OSs is of paramount importance for the area of organic electronics.
For rational choice of the high-mobility OSs from various materials with appropriate functional
properties, one needs a tool for their rapid screening.7 The problem is that rigorous μ calculation for an
OS is highly challenging due to the presence of several factors that affect the charge transport to the
comparable extent.8,9 In contrast to the inorganic semiconductors, where charge carriers are delocalized
and band model describes the charge transport rather well, in OSs charge carriers are localized at one or
several molecules because of the strong electron-phonon interaction.10,11,12 In the case of full charge
localization at a single molecule, charge hopping models10,12,13 are appropriate for μ assessment. However,
for high-mobility OSs, especially for organic semiconducting crystals (OSCs) – an OS type showing the
highest μ values2 – these models are hardly applicable since charge carriers are partially delocalized over
several molecules in these materials.11,12 This follows from the Hall effect14,15 and decrease of μ with
1

temperature15,16 observed in several OSCs and electron spin resonance (ESR) data indicating charge
delocalization over ~10 molecules in pentacene.17 The charge delocalization could be accounted using the
band model; however, the latter does not consider charge localization, and hence do not properly
describe relative values of μ and usually significantly overestimates charge mobility.18,19 Thus, considering
the interplay between the charge localization and delocalization is necessary for adequate description of
charge transport and μ estimation in high-mobility OSCs. The most state-of-the-art models of charge
transport in OSCs accounting for this interplay are polaron theory,20,21,22 transient localization scenario8,23
and delocalization-incorporated nuclear tunneling model (time-dependent wavepacket diffusion)
model.24 However, all the three models are highly computationally demanding and appear to be hardly
appropriate for rapid OSs screening.
In this context, hopping model of charge transport has been being a workhorse for assessment of
μ in OSs for many years (see e.g. Refs. [25, 26, 27]). One of its most popular variants is based on the
Marcus formula for the rate of charge transfer between the two molecules (sites):12,13,28

where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, J is
the charge transfer integral describing electronic coupling between the sites, λ is the reorganization
energy of the site that describes local electron-phonon interaction, and ΔE is the electron energy
difference between the initial and final sites (ΔE=0 if the molecules are identical). According to Eq. (1), the
main factors affecting kM for identical molecules at a given temperature are J and λ: the larger the former
and the lower the latter, the higher the kM, and hence the higher the μ. Being initially formulated for
electron transfer in electrolytes,28 Eq. (1) actually describes the small polaron hopping in OSs as well12,13,29
and was proven to reasonably estimate the charge transfer rates in many OSCs.10 Specifically, this simple
approach often allows to describe qualitatively the difference in charge mobilities within the series of
structurally similar compounds,30 and was recently proposed as a means for screening the high-mobility
OSs.25-27
However, several concerns arise with the charge transport model based on Eq. (1) (we will
henceforth refer to it as to Marcus model). First, it neglects the abovementioned (coherent) contribution
to the charge transport from delocalized charges in the high-mobility OSCs and hence underestimates
charge mobility in these materials.19 This discrepancy is most prominent for OSCs comprising very small
molecules, e.g. derivatives of tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ)31 and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF),32 which
have large λ because of strong geometry relaxation following the charge transfer.33,34 Specifically, the λ
value exceeds ~250 meV for TTF34 and TCNQ derivatives,35,36 which is ca. 2 times larger than that for largermolecule high-mobility OSCs like pentacene (λ~100 meV)30 and rubrene (140 meV).2 Thus, small-molecule
compounds should show low μ according to the Marcus model even if J values are considerable, since λ
is in the exponent of Eq. (1). For this reason, for a long time the search for high-mobility OSCs was focused
on the larger molecules,9,37 resulting in overlooking of several excellent OSCs like F2-TCNQ and HM-TTF.
Nevertheless, F2-TCNQ shows very high μ = 7 cm2/(V·s) at room temperature and bandlike charge
transport with unusually large negative dμ/dT resulting in μ~25 cm2/(V·s) at 180K.31 Similarly, μ values up
to 11 cm2/(V·s) were observed for HM-TTF.32,38 These high μ can be reconciled with large λ if
intermolecular charge delocalization, which suppresses geometry relaxation and hence lowers λ,36,39,40 is
taken into account. Hence, in order not to miss the high-mobility small-molecule OSCs, the impact of
charge delocalization on λ is to be considered when performing OS screening. Indeed, the model for
searching the high-mobility OSCs should be applicable to the materials with very different properties: size,
molecular structure, crystal packing motif, and hence different degree of charge delocalization and charge
transport mechanism – hopping or coherent. Second, Marcus model predicts μ increase with temperature
(dμ/dT>0), in contrast to the bandlike (dμ/dT<0) temperature dependence of μ observed for several OSCs
2

(see e.g. Refs. [16, 31]). This is because Eq. (1) implies thermally activated charge transport, for which
thermal fluctuations are beneficial, while in the case of bandlike (coherent) charge transport, thermal
motion is detrimental since it disrupts intermolecular charge delocalization.11,22 Third, the hopping model
neglects the role of dynamic disorder, i.e. thermal fluctuations of J, which is now widely assumed to limit
charge transport in high-mobility OSs.8,22,23
To summarize, the main challenge for OSCs screening is to consider the interplay between the
charge localization and delocalization in a reasonable but not cumbersome way. Very recently, attempts
to address this issue were performed in Refs. [19, 41] yielding models describing the charge transport in
wide range of material parameters. In Ref. [42], a phenomenological model assuming the presence of
both delocalized and localized states, occupation of which changes with temperature, was shown to
accurately reproduce the μ(T) dependence for tetramethyl–tetraselena–fulvalene (TM-TSF). Attempts to
incorporate the charge delocalization in Marcus model were performed in Refs. [36, 43] via dividing λ in
Eq. (1) by a number of molecules over which the charge is delocalized, n. However, neither of the
mentioned models did suggested a means for determination of the charge delocalization degree from the
material properties, hindering their application to assessment of charge mobility in various OSs.
In this study, we suggest a simple model for charge mobility estimation and screening of highmobility OSCs. The approach is based on the Marcus formula for charge transfer rate modified to account
for the intermolecular charge delocalization, static and dynamic disorder. The key point of the model is
the analytical expression for charge delocalization degree as a function of intrinsic material parameters
(intermolecular electronic coupling and electron-phonon interaction), disorder and temperature. The
proposed model is shown to describe well the experimental μ data for OSCs with different molecular
structure, including that with very small conjugated cores. Thus, the presented approach is anticipated to
be an efficient tool for screening of the OSCs to reveal the high-mobility ones.

2. Model formulation
2.1.

Delocalization degree

As mentioned above, the model for efficient screening of high-mobility OSCs requires accounting
for the interplay between the intermolecular charge delocalization (facilitated by the strong electronic
coupling between the molecules) and charge localization (facilitated by the reorganization, static and
dynamic disorder). Thus, an expression for charge delocalization degree is in the heart of such model. We
will first obtain it for one-dimensional (1D) case and then extrapolate it to 3D case.
One-dimensional case. Assume an infinite 1D lattice. A charge carrier (electron or hole) can be
either localized at one site or delocalized over several lattice sites (molecules). Its wavefunction can be
N

written as  =  ci i , where φi are the wavefunctions of the charge carrier localized at i-th site, and ci
i =1

are the corresponding coefficients. The sites’ energies, εi, are similar in ideal crystal. If the charge carrier
occupies one of the sites, the energy of this site decreases due to its geometry relaxation – a polaron is
formed. This decrease amounts the polaron binding energy, Ep=λ/2. Following Ref. [39], we assume that
if the charge carrier is delocalized, the site energy decreases by ci4·λ/2 (proportional to the squared extra
charge at the site). The electrons at neighboring sites interact via the charge transfer integrals, J; we
assume all J<0. Within the already mentioned assumptions, the energy of the charge carrier is:

For simplicity, we will consider the states in which charge carrier is homogeneously distributed over n
sites (in reality, charge density at inner sites should be larger40), and refer to n as to the charge

this case decreases in n times as shown schematically in Fig. 1, and Eq. (2) transforms to:
E = −

(3)

2n

Eq. (3) yields E as a monotonic function of n as shown in Supporting information (SI), Fig. S1a: E either
increases with n when 4J<λ or decreases with n when 4J>λ. In the former case, charge is localized (Fig. 1a)
because of strong electron-phonon interaction, and in the latter case, charge is delocalized (Fig. 1b,c)
since intermolecular electronic coupling overwhelms the electron-phonon interaction.
Above, the crystal was considered ideal with equal εi = ε and Ji = J. However, in real crystals, εi
suffer the static disorder resulting from the impurities or other crystal defects; the εi standard deviation,
σs, is dictated by the crystal quality. Analogously, the J values suffer the dynamic disorder induced mainly
by low-frequency intermolecular vibrations;8,23 the J standard deviation, σd, is governed by the lattice
distortion energy (describing non-local electron-phonon interaction), L, and T:

 d = 2 LkT .11,33 Both

the static and dynamic disorder facilitate charge localization. To account for this, we employ the concept
of potential well analogy44 and treat the disorder as a decrease in the energy of the localized state. The
stronger the disorder and the more localized the state, the deeper the well for it. We set the depth of the
well, ΔE, for the carrier localized at single site equal to the standard deviation of the effective site energy,
σ, which includes the static and dynamic contribution:  =  s2 + 2 LkT (we assume normal distribution
of the site energies and independence of the static and dynamic disorder, resulting in summation of their
variances).
Charge delocalization results in “averaging” of the occupied sites’ energies and lowers their
standard deviation according to the central limit theorem, yielding E ( n ) =  ( n ) =

 s2 + 2 LkT

.

Thus, the energy of the charge carrier homogeneously distributed over n sites (n≥1) is

The E(n) function described by Eq. (4) always has a minimum at certain n=nmin (see Fig. S1b), in
contrast to Eq. (3) (see Fig. S1a). If 4J>λ and disorder is not too strong, the minimum is achieved for nmin>1,
i.e. charge is delocalized, while if λ >> J, E(n) function has a minimum at nmin=1, i.e. charge is localized.
Assuming n>>1, minimization of Eq. (4) yields nmin

where h(x) is the Heaviside function.
Eq. (5) provides an analytical expression for assessment of the charge delocalization degree – the
key parameter required for description of charge transport in high-mobility OSCs. Albeit being extremely
approximate, this expression allows to consider several important aspects of charge transport in highmobility OSCs: intermolecular charge delocalization and critical role of static and dynamical disorder. Fig.

2a presents n as a function of static disorder and temperature. This figure reveals a peak for low T and σS.
The prominent n decrease with T in the case of low σS explains μ decrease with T (bandlike transport)
typically observed in the high-mobility OSCs, while for large σS, n is low and nearly temperatureindependent.

Three-dimensional case. In 3D case, multiple charge transport directions characterized by various
transfer integrals, Ji, can exist. In Ref. [36], it was shown that the increase of charge transport
dimensionality increases the probability of charge delocalization. To account for this fact, we substitute

2.2.

Charge transfer rate and charge mobility

In the case of fully localized charge (nmin=1), the rate of the charge transfer – hopping of the
polaron to the neighboring site as sketched in Fig. 1a – can be described by the abovementioned Marcus
formula, Eq. (1), which for identical sites (ΔE=0) reduces to

(7)

If the polaron is delocalized, nmin>1, we treat its motion as the shift of the set of the occupied sites
by one site as illustrated in Fig. 1b,c. In this case, we consider that Eq. (7) holds, but the reorganization
energy is to be divided by nmin in accordance with Refs. [36, 39, 43]. Thus, the transfer rate for (partially)
delocalized charge increases as shown in Fig. S2. We also account for μ dependence on the disorder

Eqs. (6,8,9) constitute the suggested approach for the μ estimation. Fig. 2b plots μ as a function
of σS and T. One can see that in dependence of σS, the model predicts qualitatively different μ(T) behavior.
For strong static disorder (large σS), thermally activated transport is observed. On the contrary, for weak
disorder (small σS), bandlike transport takes place. Thus, the model qualitatively reproduces the both
types of μ(T) dependence observed in experiment.
To test the model performance in estimation of the room-temperature μ, we applied it to various
OSCs possessing different molecular structures and sizes. The results of the test are described in the next
Section.

Charge mobilities in various crystalline organic semiconductors

The model was applied to 20 OSCs from the five popular families: (hetero)acenes, oligoarenes, TCNQ
derivatives (TCNQs), TTF derivatives (TTFs) and naphthalene-diimides (NDIs). The chemical structures of
these compounds are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S3.
Oligoacenes (e.g. pentacene), heteroacenes (e.g. dinaphthathienothiophene, DNTT) and their
derivatives (e.g. rubrene), are among the most studied OSCs. Their purified samples generally show high
charge mobilities μ>1 cm2/(V·s) due to the rigidity of their molecules resulting in small λ, and extended πconjugation favorable for large J.45 High μ in crystalline (hetero)acenes are reproduced even with the
Marcus theory,25,30 although absolute values are underestimated in about 2 times.25 This discrepancy
should be attributed to the neglect of charge delocalization by the Marcus model, while e.g. one of the
most studied oligoacene derivatives, rubrene, shows bandlike charge transport16 and Hall effect14 – the
features that are widely considered as the signatures of delocalized charges.
Oligoarenes, e.g. oligothiophenes, oligophenyls and their co-oligomers, are also among the most
popular OSCs due to their synthetical flexibility, high solubility and favorable optoelectronic properties.
However, they show low μ, which can be attributed to the flexibility of their molecules resulting in high λ,
and weak intermolecular interactions resulting in low J. Marcus theory predicts μ in these materials
reasonably well (see e.g. Ref. [51]), which is natural since no intermolecular charge delocalization is
expected in them.
In contrast to the two OSC families mentioned above, for TCNQ, TTF and their derivatives, Marcus
model often significantly underestimates the μ magnitude.36 These molecules have small conjugated cores
as compared to the majority of the high-mobility OSCs, resulting in high λ and hence low μ within the
Marcus model (see below). Nevertheless, in experiment they exhibit considerable μ values up to 11
cm2/Vs for TTFs32 and 7 cm2/(V·s) for TCNQs31 as mentioned above. The last family of the OSCs studied,
NDI derivatives, have recently become one of the most popular n-type OSCs [52]. For these materials,
which possess μ values up to 7.5 cm2/(V·s),53 assessment of μ using Marcus model was not reported. Since
several OSCs from the TTF, TCNQ and NDI families show very high μ>5 cm2/(V·s), correct estimation of μ
in this type of materials is necessary for efficient search of high-mobilty OSCs.
Fig. 3 collates the calculated λ and J values for several studied OSCs; those for the other
investigated materials are presented in Fig. S3. These values are in line with the results of previous
calculations for the mentioned OSCs (see, e.g., Refs. [2, 31, 33, 54]). From Figs. 3 and S3 it follows that
large J>100 meV are observed mostly for oligoacenes and NDI derivatives. This also corresponds to the
previous results31,54 and can be attributed to the extended conjugated cores consisting of condensed
aromatic rings, which can provide π-stacking with efficient overlapping of neighboring molecules’ orbitals.
For (hetero)acenes, the J values clearly increase with the molecular length from tetracene to DATT (cf.
Figs 3 and S3). Unexpectedly, HM-TTF that possesses small conjugated core also shows very high J>100
meV, which can be attributed to π-stacking with favorable relative position of the molecules in crystal. In
the studied crystals of TCNQ derivatives, J do not exceed 70 meV (despite of π-stacking observed in F2TCNQ), and in the oligoarenes they are below 50 meV because of the herringbone packing motif observed
7

in these materials. Reorganization energies are the largest for NDI derivatives and the lowest for
oligoacenes. As a result, within the Marcus theory, μ values are the highest for oligoacenes (mostly
exceeding 1 cm2/Vs), lower for TTF and TCNQ derivatives (0.2-0.8 cm2/Vs), and the lowest ones for NDI
derivatives (~0.1 cm2/Vs) and oligoarenes (<0.1 cm2/Vs) as shown below. However, this is in contradiction
with the abovementioned high μ>5 cm2/Vs for F2-TCNQ, HM-TTF and NDI-Chex, and points on the
necessity for accounting intermolecular charge delocalization.
Within the model suggested in this study (Eqs. (6,8,9)), the delocalization length nmin and hence μ
are most affected by the quantity  =  J i −  2 = J  −  2 . If Δ is positive, charge delocalization
i

(nmin>1) occurs, otherwise charge localization (nmin=1) takes place. Indeed, Fig. 3 and S3 show that for OSCs
showing high μ (e.g. rubrene, NDI-CHex, HM-TTF and F2-TCNQ), JΣ >> λ/2, while for that showing low μ
(e.g. 4P, 4T, BEDT-TTF), JΣ < λ/2. Noteworthily, for F2-TCNQ, HM-TTF and NDI-CHex, λ exceeds 250 meV –
rather high value nearly incompatible with high μ from the viewpoint of the Marcus theory; nevertheless,

J  > λ/2 observed for them enables charge delocalization and high μ within our model. Importantly, for
F2-TCNQ, Ji values along particular directions are not very large (<70 meV), however, 3D character of
charge transport resulting in many directions with considerable Ji enables large Δ.
Fig. 4 plots the μ values calculated using the suggested model and the Marcus one against the
experimental ones. Only experimental data obtained using organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were
considered. Static and dynamic disorder were assumed to be similar for all the OSCs, L being set to 50
meV (an estimate based on typical values obtained for oligoacenes33), and σs set to 1 meV (weak static
disorder corresponding to highly purified materials; for such a low σs, its impact on μ is insignificant). Fig.
4 clearly shows that Marcus model significantly underestimates μ for high-mobility OSCs, the most
dramatic discrepancy being observed for TCNQs, TTFs and NDIs: these points are far from the line
corresponding to the correlation between the theory and experiment. As mentioned above, the reason
for this discrepancy is high λ (see Fig. 3) that stems from the small size of the conjugated core and reduces
the charge mobility within the Marcus model dramatically. On the contrary, our model predicts
reasonable values for all the studied OSCs including small-molecular compounds (TCNQs, TTFs and NDIs)
and enables good correlation with the experiment. Specifically, for high-mobility OSCs, e.g. F2-TCNQ and
rubrene, the suggested model predicts higher μ than the Marcus model (and much closer to the
experiment) since it considers charge delocalization in these materials. Note that improved correlation
with the experiment for our model is observed with L and σs values equal for various compounds,
indicating that the suggested model outperforms the Marcus one not because of the extra adjustable
parameters, but due to the consideration of the factors essential for charge transport. It is however worth
noting that the model underestimates the μ values for low-mobility OSCs, e.g. oligoarenes. A possible
reason is that the model accounts only detrimental impact of the dynamic disorder, while variation of the
J values can be favorable for hopping of localized carriers.33 In addition, for materials with small J, L should
be small as well since it is related to J variance, while in Fig. 4 it was taken similar for all the OSCs studied
resulting in possible overestimation of the dynamic disorder in low-mobility OSCs.

one, black) with the experimental data in linear (a) and logarithmic (b) scales. L=50 meV, σs=1 meV.
Blue line corresponds to the one-to-one correlation. The experimental OFET μ data are from Refs. [7,
16, 31, 37, 38, 41, 53, 55-64], see Figs. 3 and S3 for details.
As follows from Fig. 4, the suggested model, albeit being very approximate, can efficiently predict
charge mobility in OSCs possessing different conjugated cores and sizes. This opportunity is enabled by
the accounting for the interplay between the charge localization and delocalization in OSCs, which is
essential for description of the charge transport and prediction of μ. The suggested model is ideologically
close to that formulated in Ref. [41], which also considers charge delocalization and static disorder. The
μ(T) dependences obtained in Ref. [41] are close to that observed within our model and also show either
bandlike or thermally activated behavior in dependence of the material parameters. However, in contrast
to the mentioned model, our approach provides a means for μ prediction, not just for its description. This
is enabled by the suggested formula for the degree of charge delocalization – the number of molecules
(sites) over which charge carrier is delocalized under various conditions, Eq. (6). Such a predictive power
makes our model an efficient tool for the search of high-mobility OSCs. Importantly, if reliable tool for OS
crystal structure prediction will be developed, its combination with the suggested model could enable
assessment of μ from just the OS molecular structure – the long-standing challenge in organic electronics.
Solution of this problem will provide an unprecedent freedom in design of OSs with the desired functional
properties that can boost the development of organic electronics.

4. Conclusions
An analytical model capable to predict charge mobility in crystalline organic semiconductors with various
molecular structures and sizes is proposed. The heart of the model is the proposed expression for charge
delocalization degree as a function of electronic coupling between the molecules, electron-phonon
interaction, static and dynamic disorder. The predicted charge mobilities correspond well to the
10

experimental ones. Importantly, the model reproduces high experimental charge mobilities for several
OSCs build of small molecules, in contrast to the widely used Marcus model that significantly
underestimates them. We thus anticipate that the suggested approach will serve as an efficient tool for
screening of the high-mobility OSCs, which are necessary for improved operation of organic electronic
devices.
