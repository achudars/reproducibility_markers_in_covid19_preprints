We propose a driving protocol which allows to use quantum dot arrays as quantum simulators
for 1D topological phases. We show that by driving the system out of equilibrium, one can imprint
bond-order in the lattice (producing structures such as dimers, trimers, etc) and selectively modify
the hopping amplitudes at will. Our driving protocol also allows for the simultaneous suppression of
all the undesired hopping processes and the enhancement of the necessary ones, enforcing certain key
symmetries which provide topological protection. In addition, we have discussed its implementation
in a 12-QD array with two interacting electrons and found correlation effects in their dynamics,
when configurations with different number of edge states are considered.

Introduction: Topological matter, and in particular
topological insulators (TIs) [1‚Äì3] are materials of interest due to the presence of topologically protected surface
states, robust to local perturbations. Consequently, a
great effort is being made to simulate the behaviour of
TIs by tailoring other quantum systems, whose properties
can be more easily controlled. Within this context, timedependent modulations have proven to be useful tools to
modify the topology [4‚Äì15]. Particularly, they have been
used to simulate the so-called ‚ÄùFloquet topological insulators‚Äù (FTIs) [16‚Äì18] upon different systems [18‚Äì39].
Quantum dots (QDs) have revealed themselves as highly
tunable quantum systems [40‚Äì43], in which both on-site
energies [44] and couplings [45, 46] can be independently
addressed. This makes them an interesting platform for
quantum simulation [47‚Äì49]. Recent experimental evidence on scalable quantum dot devices [50, 51] demonstrates reproducible and controllable long QD arrays,
which opens up new possibilities of simulating 1D TIs.
In this work we show that a quantum simulator for 1D
topological phases can be obtained by periodically driving an array of QDs with long-range hopping. We propose a driving protocol which allows us to imprint bondorder in the lattice [52], while also offers tunability for
the long-range hoppings. This control can lead to configurations that would be unreachable otherwise, while
preserving the fundamental symmetries which guarantee
topological features. Thus, the driving protocol triggers
non-equilibrium topological behavior in a trivial setup,
opening the door to the simulation of different topological phases. We also study the exact time-evolution for
the case of two interacting electrons, and show that the
dynamics of different edge states can become highly correlated. This allows to discriminate between different
topological phases and also opens up new possibilities
for quantum state transfer protocols.
Our proposal can also be implemented in other set-ups
as cold atoms or trapped ions [53‚Äì60].

Model : We consider a Hamiltonian describing a periodically driven chain of QDs:

H(t) =

Jij c‚Ä†i cj +

X

X

|i‚àíj|‚â§R

Ai f (t)c‚Ä†i ci

i

(1)

‚â° Harray + Hdriv (t) ,
where c‚Ä†i (ci ) is the creation (destruction) operator for
a spin-less fermion at the ith site of the array. The first
term represents the static Hamiltonian for a QD array
of N sites, with Jij being the real hopping amplitude
connecting the ith and j th dots. Note that long-range
hoppings are allowed to take place, up to range R. We
will assume that hopping amplitudes in the undriven system decay monotonically as a function of the distance between sites, Jij = J(|i ‚àí j|). The second term in Eq. (1),
Hdriv (t), corresponds to a time-periodic modulation of
the on-site potentials Ai with f (t) = f (T + t), and frequency œâ = 2œÄ/T .
Regarding the simulation of 1D topological phases in
QD arrays, the purpose of the time-periodic modulation
is threefold: First, the driving must generate bond order, which is a crucial ingredient in toy models such as
the SSH [61]. Second, certain neighbor hoppings can be
simultaneously suppressed through the so-called coherent
destruction of tunneling [62, 63]. This difficult requirement turns out to be feasible when our driving protocol
is included. Finally, other hoppings can be enhanced in
order to generate the necessary symmetries for the topological protection, and to be able to explore topological
sectors with larger topological invariant.
All these objectives can be achieved through a spatially
modulated square ac field [64‚Äì66]

and in particular, the simulation of an effective dimer
lattice with long-range hopping can be realized by choosing the Ai in a stair-like fashion,
A2n = n(Œ± + Œ≤), A2n‚àí1 = n(Œ± + Œ≤) ‚àí Œ±.

2
with n = 1, 2, 3, ..., which translates into an alternating difference between two consecutive sites, namely
A2n ‚àí A2n‚àí1 = Œ± and A2n+1 ‚àí A2n = Œ≤. Given the
time-periodicity of the Hamiltonian H(t) = H(t + T )
[67, 68], we can take advantage of Floquet theory to
solve the time-dependent SchroÃàdinger equation. The solutions take the form |œàn (t)i = e‚àíin t |un (t)i, where the
so-called Floquet modes |un (t)i = |un (t + T )i have the
same periodicity as the Hamiltonian, and n are the socalled quasienergies, which play an analogous role to
the energies in the static Hamiltonians. In the highfrequency regime (œâ  J0 ), the dynamics is essentially
dictated by the stroboscopic evolution of an effective
time-independent Hamiltonian Heff , which can be derived with a Magnus expansion. This leads to an effective
Hamiltonian identical to Harray , but with renormalized
hopping amplitudes [69]:

From Equation (4) we can see that even-neighbor
hoppings Ji,i¬±2m with m = 1, 2, 3, ... (¬± for hoppings
to the right and left, respectively) renormalize through
Ai ‚àí Ai¬±2m = ‚àìm(Œ± + Œ≤). This is important, because
topological phases with chiral symmetry can be spoiled
by the presence of hoppings connecting sites within the
same sublattice. The quenching of all JÀúi,i¬±2m can be
achieved by choosing Œ± + Œ≤ = 2œâq, with q = 0, 1, 2, ....
Hence, chiral symmetry is recovered, independently of
the maximum range of the hoppings included.
On the other hand, the renormalization of oddneighbor hoppings leads to bond ordering, due to the
alternating structure of the driving protocol. Together
with the presence of chiral symmetry, this ensures the
existence of distinct topological phases. We identify the
0
renormalized J2i,2i‚àír as JÀú‚àír
and J2i+r,2i as JÀúr (r ‚àà
[1, 3, 5, . . . , R]), obtaining [69]

Notice that now long-range odd-hoppings can be
tuned, while keeping even-hoppings suppressed. This
can make long-range hoppings dominate over short-range
ones, and then allows to explore different topological
phases by just tuning the driving amplitudes. The sign
of r in the subscript is relevant since hopping amplitudes
(0)
(0)
are now complex functions, and hence JÀú¬±r = (JÀú‚àìr )‚àó .
Interestingly, our protocol can be generalized to
reproduce different kinds of bond-ordering and to
enforce other symmetries as well by choosing the
driving on-site amplitudes accordingly. A trimer chain

[70] is an particular example of a 1D system hosting
non-trivial topological phases that can be realized in
our set up. In this case, chiral symmetry is intrinsically absent, but the presence of another crystalline
symmetry, space-inversion symmetry, can provide for
topological protection [71]. A trimer chain can be realized in a QD driven monomer chain just by considering
A2n ‚àíA2n‚àí1 = A2n+1 ‚àíA2n = Œ± and A2n+2 ‚àíA2n+1 = Œ≤.
Topological phase diagram for driven QD arrays. In
QD arrays, the bare hopping amplitudes typically decay exponentially with distance, with a decay length Œª:
Jij = Je‚àídij /Œª , where dij is the distance between the
ith and j th dots and J is of the order of tens of ¬µeV,
which are the typical energy scales in these setups. The
distance between two consecutive QDs is set to a = 1/2
so that the unit cell in the effective dimerized chain is
1. By varying the value of Œ± and Œª in the driven system, topological phases with different topological invariant can be realized (Fig.1). The topological invariant W
is calculated as the winding number of the Bloch vector

For small values of Œª, only W = 1 and W = 0 phases
are allowed for all values of Œ±/œâ, since first-neighbor hoppings are dominant (this corresponds to the SSH model).
Then, when Œª is increased, other phases with larger W
are possible, as a function of the ratio Œ±/œâ (we have also
calculated the size of the gap in the Supplemental Material [69], as one is typically interested in gap sizes smaller
than the temperature of the setup).
Typically, other driving protocols have been considered in the literature, such as sinusoidal driving fields
f (t) = sin(œât + œÜ) [8, 10, 11, 27], or standing waves
PN
f (t) = cos(œât) j=1 cos(kxj + œÜ) [73]. However, none of
them would be suitable for engineering arbitrary chiral
topological phases. In both previous cases, renormalization of the hopping amplitudes occurs through a zeroorder Bessel function, whose roots are not periodically
spaced. Hence, it would not be possible to suppress all
even hoppings at once, and chiral symmetry would not
be present. On the other hand, a homogeneous square
driving field with Ai = A could restore chiral symmetry in a dimerized chain but cannot generate topological
phases beyond those with W = 0, 1 if hoppings decay
exponentially with distance.
The experimental evidence provided in [50] demonstrates a reproducible and controllable 12-quantum-dot
device. Motivated by this experimental setup, we propose the implementation of our driving protocol in an ar-

ray of 12 quantum dots. In Fig.2 we show the quasienergies, as given by the effective Hamiltonian, of a driven 12quantum-dot array, as a function of Œ±/œâ, with first- and
third-neighbor hoppings (second-neighbor hoppings were
initially present, but are effectively suppressed by the
driving protocol), fixing Œª = 1.5. The spectrum shows
two topological phases with W = 1 and W = 2.
Dynamics of two interacting particles. The number of
edge states hosted by a finite system and their localization properties determine the motion of charges along
the chain. Then, for an electron initially occupying the
ending site, one would see oscillations between the two
edges of the chain, with a frequency defined by the energy splitting: œâosc ‚àù E+ ‚àí E‚àí , being E¬± the energy of
each edge state in the pair. Hence, one can discriminate
between topological phases with different number of edge
states by studying the electron dynamics.
These ideas are illustrated in Fig.3, where we consider
two electrons with opposite spin loaded in a driven array
of 12 QDs in such a way that the spin-up (spin-down)
particle, which we will denote as ‚Üë (‚Üì), initially occupies the first (third) site. We have also included a local
interaction term, being the total Hamiltonian:

(red and blue filling for the valence and conduction
band, respectively), as a function of Œ±/œâ, including
first- and third- neighbor hoppings, in the
high-frequency regime. Second-neighbor hoppings have
been suppressed through the driving protocol. The
parameters are Œª/œâ = 1.5, q = 1. Inset: each pair of
edge states in the W = 2 phase has a different energy
splitting, which can be also varied by tuning Œ±/œâ.

where œÉ =‚Üë, ‚Üì. We do not include any spin-flip terms,
since experimental evidence on silicon QDs confirms that
the spin relaxation time within these QD structures is
very long compared with the other energy scales of the
system [74]. The Ai are chosen as indicated before, and
Œ± is fixed such that the system hosts either two or four
edge states.
Then, the dynamics is exactly calculated
from the
Rt
time evolution operator U (t, 0) = e‚àíi 0 H‚Üë‚Üì dt . Since
H‚Üë‚Üì is time-independent in each half period, the timeevolution operator U (T, 0) can be factorized into two independent time-evolution operators, U (T, 0) = U (T ) =
U+ ( T2 )U‚àí ( T2 ), where the subscript ¬± corresponds to the
sign of f (t) in each of them. We choose for our simulations œâ  J in order to accurately match the analytic
expression in Eq.(5), however we have checked that values œâ & J still produce the expected behavior.
First, Œ± is chosen such that the system hosts one pair
of edge states (W = 1 for the left half of Fig.3), which
have the largest weight at the ending sites of the chain.
When interaction is turned off, particle ‚Üë oscillates between the ends of the chain, while particle ‚Üì spreads along
the chain: at the third site, other states from the bulk
have a non-negligible contribution and the edge states do
not dominate the dynamics. When Œ± is fixed so that the
system has four edge states (W = 2 for the right half of

FIG. 3: Occupation of each site of a driven 12-QD array as a function of time when two electrons with opposite spin
are loaded into the system, for different values of U . The array has first- to third-neighbor couplings, whose values
initially decay exponentially with distance, choosing Œª = 1.5. Considering the high-frequency regime with œâ = 100
and q = 1, the values for Œ± have been chosen such that the desired hopping renormalization is realized. The four left
plots correspond to Œ± = 230, resulting in a topological phase with W = 1 (two edge states). The four right plots
correspond to Œ± = 410, yielding a configuration with W = 2 (four edge states)

Fig.3), one of the pairs is maximally localized at the first
and last sites, while the other has the largest weight at
the third and second-to-last sites. Hence, each particle
is coupled to a different pair of edge states and it displays oscillations between different sites. The frequency
of oscillation is also different, since each pair has a different energy splitting (see inset in Fig.2). The second pair
has a bigger splitting and thus oscillations for particle ‚Üì
happen faster.
Interestingly, for the case of non-vanishing local interaction one can see that the general effect is to correlate
the dynamics of the two electrons. For the case of just
one pair of edge states, the interaction correlates the edge
mode with the bulk. They exchange spectral weight and
oscillate coherently. However the case of two pairs of edge
modes is more interesting, as the interaction correlates
their dynamics, modifying the frequency of the oscillation while maintaining the edge modes isolated from the
bulk. Notice that in both cases the frequency of oscillations slightly shifts, which is expected due to the nonlinear corrections produced by the interaction.
This difference in the exact dynamics for two particles
confirms the method proposed in this work to engineer
topological phases and provides a way to characterize
them by detecting the time evolution of the charge occu-

pation in the system.
Additionally, it is known that the edge states hosted
by an SSH finite chain with non-trivial topology allow
for long-range transfer of doublons directly from one end
to the other without populating the intermediate region
[4]. Here we show that the two-electron states can be
directly transferred between outer dots by considering
topological models with a larger winding number. Then,
the presence of more pairs of edge states, which can be
controlled by choosing a suitable value for Œ±/œâ, opens up
the possibility of designing new quantum-state-transfer
protocols.
Conclusions: We have proposed a driving protocol to
engineer topological phases in a QD array with exponentially decaying hoppings. This is achieved by spatially
modulating the driving amplitudes to imprint bondordering, and by selective enhancement or suppression of
the different hopping processes. This generates the necessary symmetries for topological protection. We have simulated a dimerized chain with chiral symmetry by setting
stair-like driving amplitudes and dynamically quenching
even hoppings. Furthermore, our protocol allows to enhance odd long-range hoppings versus short-range ones,
thus opening the door to explore topological phases with

5
different W . The use of square pulses allows for highly
selective tunability of the different hoppings, where standard Floquet approaches using harmonic pulses would
fail.
For the experimental implementation, scalable QD
arrays of increasing size have been recently fabricated
[50, 51], making our proposal feasible with state of the
art techniques.
To test our results we have simulated the exact dynamics for an initial product state, including local Coulomb
interaction. We show that charge dynamics, which can be
measured with quantum detectors in QD setups, discriminates between different topological phases. Additionally,
we have found that the interplay of driving and interactions produces a drag effect between the electrons, which
forms correlated edge modes; this is not only of fundamental interest but also relevant for quantum simulation
and information purposes.
Importantly, our protocol can also be implemented in
other platforms, or even straightforwardly extended to
2D systems. The main requirement is the local control
of the driving amplitude at each site. In optical lattices
[53, 54] this could be done with additional lasers [55],
and the engineering of long-range hoppings is well suited
in this case by selection of certain optical transitions
[56]. In this setup, different topological features have
been directly measured [57‚Äì60]. Trapped ions can also
be used, as it is possible to locally address each ion, and
their effective Hamiltonian can be reduced to that of
single excitations with long-range hopping decaying as
‚àº d‚àí3 [73, 75]. Finally, molecular patterning on surfaces
by adsorbates could also be considered [76‚Äì80].

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Floquet Theory

For driven periodic quantum systems with H(t) = H(t + T ), the presence of time translation symmetry
enables the use of Floquet formalism. The SchroÃàdinger equation can be solved in terms of the Floquet states
|œàn (t)i = e‚àíin t |un (t)i, where the so-called Floquet modes |un (t)i = |un (t + T )i have the same periodicity of the
Hamiltonian, and the role of static eigenenergies is assumed by the quasienergies n .
In the high-frequency regime (œâ  J0 ), the Floquet modes do not vary much during a period compared with other
frequency regimes. The dynamics is essentially dictated by an effective time-independent Hamiltonian, which can be
derived as a series expansion in powers of œâ. In order to obtain an effective Hamiltonian that is non-perturbative
in the driving amplitudes Ai , we first transform the original Hamiltonian in the rotating frame with respect to the
driving as
HÃÉ(t) = U ‚Ä† (t)HU (t) ‚àí iU ‚Ä† (t)‚àÇt U (t) ,
with U (t) = e‚àíi

R

, so that the new hopping amplitudes change with a time-dependent complex phase

HÃÉ(t) =

(9)

and F (t) =

As it turns out, the leading term of this expansion is just the time-average of the Hamiltonian, Heff = H0 [67, 81].
If the frequency is sufficiently large, truncating this expansion to zeroth order gives already a good approximation to
the effective Hamiltonian. The result is a time-independent Hamiltonian with renormalized hopping amplitudes.

Gap

The size of the gap has been calculated as a function of Œª and Œ±/œâ. We aim to simulate configurations with a wide
gap compared to the energy bands, so that the edge states are far from the extended states in the bulk to prevent
them from hybridizing. As |Œ±|/œâ is increased, the renormalized hoppings scale as œâ/|Œ±|, so the band structure is
expected to shrink. This effect can be observed in Fig.4, as the gap is bigger in the central region, corresponding to
W = 1 and W = 0 phases and small values of Œ±/œâ.
Renormalized hopping amplitudes and Hamiltonian in the high-frequency regimen

We consider a driven 1D quantum dot array in the high-frequency regime. The system can be described through
a time-independent Hamiltonian with renormalized hopping parameters. Since the driving protocol achieves the
coherent destruction of all even-neighbor hoppings, we will only consider odd-neighbor hoppings, which in turn are
renormalized in an alternating fashion.
Hence, we can identify two types of renormalized hoppings. Being r ‚àà Zodd the range of the hopping and j the
cell index, we first find that hoppings of the form J2j+r,2j or J2j,2j+r (backward and forward hopping, respectively)
renormalize through

where we have made use of the relation Œ± + Œ≤ = 2œâq (q = 0, 1, 2, ...), which is essential to imprint chiral symmetry.
With this constraint, Œ≤ is fixed by the value of Œ± and thus we have only one tuneable parameter. Therefore, these
hopping amplitudes correspond to

In order to make an explicit distintion between both renormalized hoppings, we have added a prime index on the
second type. Since our system has space-translation invariance, we can neglect the site index in our notation and
write

Since hopping amplitudes are now complex functions, the direction of the hopping is relevant and our notation
0
must account for this matter. We can see that both JÀúr and JÀú‚àír
correspond to backward hoppings whereas their
0
complex-conjugates JÀú‚àír and JÀúr correspond to forward hoppings.
In the high-frequency regimen, we can therefore describe the system as bipartite and write the real-space Hamiltonian in terms of creation/annihilation operators in each of the two sublattices A and B. First, let us keep the site
indexes explicitely on the renormalized hopping parameters, obtaining
