EXPONENTIAL SUMS OF WITT TOWERS OVER AFFINOIDS
MATTHEW SCHMIDT
Abstract. In this paper we construct a Dwork theory for general exponential
sums over affinoids in Witt towers. Using this, we compute the degree of
the L-function, its Hodge polygon and examine when the Hodge and Newton
polygons coincide.

In this paper we build on the methods developed in [5], where we constructed a
“universal” Dwork theory that applies to exponential sums over affinoids. Using the
framework from there, we build an alternative dwork cohomology using a truncated
Artin-Hasse exponential which allows us to directly compute the degree of the Lfunction. To our knowledge, the general (m > 1) truncated Artin-Hasse exponential
has not been used in this setting before. Furthermore, we compute the Hodge
polygon via the traditional Artin-Hasse exponential and use these p-adic estimates
to generalize Zhu’s result from [6] about when the Newton and Hodge bounds
coincide.
Our main results are the following two theorems.
Theorem 0.1. The power series Lf (s) is a polynomial in s of degree
ℓ
X
d = ( ( max
j=1

0≤i≤m−1

pm−i−1 dij + 1)) − 2.

This result is not new (see Remark 4.7 in [4]), but prior results use the geometry
of the Witt tower whereas we utilize p-adic methods. Our second result is the
computation of the Hodge polygon of Lf (s), which is described as follows.
Theorem 0.2. Let NPf be the p-adic Newton polygon of Lf (s). Then NPf lies
above the polygon with slopes:
(

dij ,j pm−ij −1 n=0

where ij is such that p
dij ,j = max0≤i≤m−1 p
dij . Furthermore, if ij =
m − 1 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ, these polygons coincide if and only if p ≡ 1 mod lcmj dij ,j .
1. Lifting f (x)
We will first lift f (x) to a p-adic ring in which we can construct a p-adic Dwork
cohomology. Recall, that if a ∈ W (R), we denote by ā the image of a in R, that is
a mod p, and for a ∈ R, we define the Teichmüller lift of a in W (R) to be â.
Lemma 1.1. There is a ring isomorphism:
ω : Wm (Fqk ) → Zqk /pm Zqk

and so the lemma follows from the isomorphism Wm (K) ∼

and

Define the additive character χ : Wm (Fp ) → Cp by mapping χ(x) = ζpm
extend it to Wm (Fqk ) by composing it with the trace:
χqk (x) = χ(ω(TrWm (Fqk )/Wm (Fp ) (x))).
The exponential sum can then be written:
X
Sf (k) =

χqk (f (x)).

x∈F×k ,

x6=P1 ,··· ,Pℓ

Using Lemma 1.1 we can lift the exponential sum Sf (k) from an object defined
over a finite field as in (4), to one defined over a p-adic ring. However, before we
can choose an appropriate lifting of f (x) some technical lemmas are required.
Lemma 1.2. Let x, y ∈ Cp such that ordp (x) ≥ 0 and ordp (y) ≥ 0. Then for
n
n
n ≥ 1, (x + py)p = xp + pn g(x, y).
Proof. Clearly:

When r > 0, ordp ( pr ) = n − ordp (r) and hence

Thus ordp ( pr=1 pr xn−r (py)r ) ≥ n and the lemma follows.

and the lemma follows.

2. p-adic Banach Spaces
Define a p-adic affinoid ring as follows.
Definition 2.1. For 0 < r ≤ 1, let
cj |p ≥ r for 2 ≤ j ≤ ℓ}.
Ar = {x ∈ Cp : |x|p ≤ 1/r, |x − P

It’s easy to see that

d
A1 = {x ∈ Cp : |x|p = 1 and |x − Pbj |p = 1 for 2 ≤ j ≤ ℓ} = {x ∈ Falg
p : x̄ 6= Pj }.
For convenience, we will often write A1 = A.

Definition 2.2. Consider the affinoid space:
H† = Ah

1
x − Pb1

,··· ,

1
x − Pbℓ

i.

The ring H† is the set of overconvergent anaytic elements on A. (That is, any
h(x) ∈ A[[ x−1Pb , · · · , x−1Pb ]] lies in H† if and only if it can be evaluated at any
1
ℓ
x ∈ A.)
In this section we’ll study some fundamental properties of H† and look at some
special quotient spaces. We start with a basic result, the Mittag-Leffler decomposition

2.1. Quotient Spaces of H† . This section (along with the following Dwork cohomology) is based on the methods used by Lauder and Wan in their papers [1] and
[2].
For convenience in this subsection, we will write Xj = x−1Pb . Fix an arbitrary
j
Pℓ PRj
polynomial H = j=1 i=0
hij Xji in A[X1 , · · · , Xℓ ], with Rj ≥ 0 and hRj ,j 6= 0
P Rj
hij Xji . Define two operators on H† :
and say Hj = i=0
D = EH + E

Dj = EHj + E,
d
where E = x dx
.
We wish to understand the quotient space H† /D(H† ). Namely, we are interested
in its dimension as a module over A. Our goal will be to show that H† /D(H† ) is
isomorphic to the following finite free A-module R:

Definition 2.4. Consider the set
B = {1, X1 , · · · , X1R1 −1 , X2 , · · · , X2R2 } ∪ {Xji |j ≥ 3, 1 ≤ i ≤ Rj + 1}
and define the A-module R = spanA B ⊂ H† .
For the next lemma we will need some notational sugar:


Rj − 1 if j = 2
′
Rj = Rj
if j = 1


Rj + 1 if j ≥ 3

Lemma 2.5. Fix 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ and take u ≥ Rj′ . Let
rj,u =

1
cj )δ(j)
Rj hRj ,j (−P

u−R′j

Xj

∈ Hj† ,

where δ(j) = 1 if j ≥ 3 and δ(j) = 0 if j = 1, 2. (Take (∞)0 = 00 = 1.) There is
then a congruence
Dj rj,u = (EHj + E)rj,u ≡ Xju mod R.
Proof. Observe that the action of E on the terms Xji is nothing but:

All the terms except

′
R1 = R1 , then (EH1 + E)r1,R1 ≡ X1R1 mod R, and so if u > R1 , by induction
(EH1 + E)r1,u ≡ X1u mod R. The proof is similar for j = 2.
For j ≥ 3, first compute that
EHj =

the terms in (5) except for Xju have degree strictly less than u, and so by the same
induction argument with base case u = Rj + 1, the claim follows.

For any g(x) ∈ Hj† /D(Hj† ), Lemma 2.5 implies that we can write uniquely
R′

g(x) ≡

X

aij Xji mod D(Hj† ),

and so it now remains to decompose H† /D(H† ) in terms of Hj† /D(Hj† ):
Theorem 2.6. dimA H† /D(H† ) =

dimA Hj† /D(Hj† ).

Proof. For a fixed j0 and i0 , we have by partial fraction expansion

Hence for appropriate j and u, by induction on u (with base case u = Rj′ ), it
follows that
u−R′j

(EH + H)rj,u ≡ (EHj + E)rj,u +

X

h′ij Xji ≡ (EHj + E)rj,u

≡ Xju mod R,

and so the Theorem follows because every g(x) ∈ H† /D(H† ) can be written

3. The Degree of the L-function
We will now apply the prior section’s results about the space H† to construct
our Dwork theory.

By Theorem 4.1 in [3], the disk of convergence of Ek (x) is
k+1

1

Dk+1 = {x : |x|p < p−(k+1+ p−1 )/p

}.

Furthermore, for any j ≤ k, by Theorem 4.9 also in [3], because p > m ≥ k, it is
guaranteed that πk lies inside the disc of convergence of Ek and it’s therefore well
defined to consider the splitting functions

θk (xp ).
θk (x) = Ek (πk x) and θ̂k =

First, we prove that D is injective.
Lemma 3.8. D is injective.
Proof. Suppose that g ∈ ker D so that

some scalar c. It remains to show that exp(−H) 6∈ H.
RecallPthat exp(x) converges on the disk {x ∈ Cp | ordp x > 1/(p − 1)}. So let
1
H(x) = v,i,j,k hvijk
c pv k and
−

(x−Pj )

ordp hvijk = ordp γm−i,v =

pm−i−1−v (p

− v.

Hence
min ordp hijvk = min(

− (m − 1),

taking i = 0 and v = m − i − 1. But this implies that |H|gauss = p−( p−1 −(m−1)) =
pm−1 p−1/(p−1) ≥ p−1/(p−1) .
By a well known property of the gauss norm, we can therefore find x0 ∈ A1 such
that |H(x0 )|p = pm−1 p−1/(p−1) , and so at this x0 , exp(H(x0 )) is not defined, and
exp(−H) 6∈ H† .

Proposition 3.9. The degree of the L-function is the degree of the first homology
space, deg Lf (s) = dimZq [[πm ]] H0 .
Proof. Just as in Theorem 6.13 in [5], because αa is completely continuous by
Proposition 3.6, we see that Cf (s) = det(1 − αa s). A simple computation then
shows that
det(1 − αa s)
Cf (s)
=
.
Lf (s) =
Cf (qs)
det(1 − qαa s)
Since H† = D(H† ) ⊕ H† /D(H† ),
(7)

Tr(αa |H† ) = Tr(αa

D(H† )

) + Tr(αa

H† /D(H† )

But by the relation αa ◦ D = D ◦ (qαa ) from Lemma 3.7, D
D is bijective on D(H† )). Thus:
Tr(αa

D(H† )

) = Tr(D−1 ◦ αa

).

◦ αa ◦ D = qαa (since

◦ D) = Tr(qαa |H† ).

12

MATTHEW SCHMIDT

And so (7) becomes:
Tr(αa |H† ) = Tr(qαa |H† ) + Tr(ᾱa |H0 ),
that is Tr(αa |H† ) − Tr(qαa |H† ) = Tr(ᾱa |H0 ), and the same formula holds when αa
is replaced with αka since D ◦ (q k αka ) = αka ◦ D. Thus by the well known formula
det(1 − φs) = exp(−

we have the identity
Lf (s) = det(1 − ᾱa s|H0 ),

Theorem 3.10. dimZq [[πm ]] H0 = ( j=1 (max0≤i≤m−1 pm−i−1 dij + 1)) − 2.

4. The Hodge Polygon
In this second section we utilize a more classical style Dwork theory from the
Artin-Hasse exponential and compute the Hodge polygon of the L-function and
generalize the main result of [6]. The theory in this section is analogous to the
work from [5], but we provide a detailed sketch with a focus on p-adic estimates
that we will use to compute the Newton polygon.

2
dij ,j pm−ij +1 (p − 1)
2dij ,j pm−ij −1

bound is obtained, then dik |(p − 1) for all 1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ. Oppositely, if dik |(p − 1) for
all 1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ, then the Hodge bound is necessarily achieved under the assumption
×
that dij j pm−ij −1 = dij j , because n(p−1)

Remark (The “Truncated” Hodge Polygon). If we use the Dwork theory developed
in Section 3 utilizing the truncated Artin-Hasse exponential, we can derive lower
bounds for the Newton polygon of Lf (s), just like we would to compute the Hodge
polygon in the traditional case. However, we see that the the resulting lower bound
is actually lower than the Hodge bound.
Recall from Proposition 3.6 that
ordp (Fnj ) ≥

p − (m − ij )
p − (m − ij )
n
·
=n·(
) = n · Mj .
dij ,j
pm−ij +1
dij ,j pm−ij +1

Applying the same procedure as above yields a lower polygon consisting of slopes
(10)

a(p − 1)(n − 1) p − (m − ij )
a(n − 1)
(p − 1)(p − (m − ij ))

Interestingly, 10 implies that as p → ∞, this “truncated” Hodge polygon converges
upward towards the regular Hodge bound. (This is expected since the coefficients of
the truncated Artin-Hasse functions converge upon the coefficients of the classical
Artin-Hasse as p → ∞, i.e. uki → ui as p → ∞.)
