A uniform or periodic dielectric slab can serve as an optical waveguide for which guided modes are
important, and it can also be used as a diffraction structure for which resonant modes with complex
frequencies are relevant. Guided modes are normally studied below the lightline where they exist
continuously and emerge from points on the lightline, but isolated guided modes may exist above
the lightline and they are the so-called bound states in the continuum. Resonant modes are usually
studied above the lightline (defined using the real part of the complex frequency), but they are
not connected to the guided modes on the lightline. In this work, through analytic and numerical
calculations for uniform and periodic slabs, we establish an indirect link between the resonant and
guided modes. It is shown that as the (Bloch) wavenumber is increased, a resonant mode continues
its existence below the lightline, until it reaches its end at an Exceptional Point (EP) where a pair
of improper modes emerge, and one branch of improper modes eventually approaches the lightline
at the starting point of a guided mode. Leaky modes with a real frequency and a complex (Bloch)
wavenumber (propagation constant) are also related to the improper modes. They emerge at EPs
in eigenvalue formulations where the frequency is regarded as a parameter. Our study is based
on a non-Hermitian eigenvalue formulation that includes resonant, improper and leaky modes, and
provides a complete picture for different kinds of eigenmodes on uniform and periodic slabs.

INTRODUCTION

Eigenvalue problems for photonic structures such as
optical waveguides, resonant cavities and periodic media are of fundamental importance [1, 2]. Although the
research topic has a long history, new and interesting
wave phenomena related to eigenvalue problems are continuously being discovered. Recently, bound states in the
continuum (BICs) [3], which are trapped or guided modes
with their frequencies within the radiation continuum,
have attracted much attention and found a number of significant applications in optics [4–6]. Exceptional points
(EPs) [7, 8], which are spectral degeneracies for nonHermitian eigenvalue problems with coalescing eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, are being intensively investigated
in optics [9–12], and may have valuable applications in
lasing and sensing [13, 14]. EPs are also the key to many
unusual and counter-intuitive wave phenomena in PT symmetric and related structures [15–18]. For dielectric
structures that are unbounded in one or two spatial directions, the most important eigenvalue problems are those
for guided and resonant modes [19]. Guided modes decay exponentially in the media surrounding the structure,
and usually exist below the lightline. The resonant modes
radiate power to infinity, have complex frequencies, and
are usually studied above the lightline. The BICs are
isolated guided modes above the lightline, and they can
also be regarded as special resonant modes with infinite
quality factors [5]. EPs of resonant modes have been
found on various open dielectric structures [9–13]. This
is not unexpected, since the eigenvalue problems for res-

onant modes on open structures are non-Hermitian due
to radiation losses.
For unbounded structures that are periodic or invariant in one or two spatial directions, band structures
for guided and resonant modes have been calculated by
many authors. Below the lightline, there are continuous
branches of guided modes, and they emerge from starting
points on the lightline. Resonant modes are often calculated above the lightline, and they seem to approach the
lightline near the starting points of the guided modes.
However, careful numerical studies show that the guided
modes and the resonant modes are not connected on the
lightline. In fact, the resonant modes cross the lightline
with a nonzero imaginary part in their complex frequencies. We believe it is interesting to study the resonant
modes below the lightline, and establish a link between
the resonant and guided modes. To the best of our knowledge, such a link has never been established before. To
find the missing link between these two kinds of modes,
we concentrate on simple uniform or periodic dielectric
slabs in this paper. Our study relies on a mathematical
formulation that includes not only the resonant modes,
but also improper modes that grow exponentially in the
surrounding media and leaky modes with real frequencies
and complex wavenumbers [1]. Our analysis reveals that
as the wavenumber is increased, a typical branch of resonance modes continues its existence below the lightline
until it reaches an EP where a pair of improper modes
emerge, and one branch of the improper modes eventually ends up on the lightline where it connects to the
guided modes.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,
we present some basic properties for eigenvalue problems
on one-dimensional (1D) structures for which a uniform
slab is a special case. In Sec. III, we show numerical

2
results for different types of eigenmodes on a slab with
a constant refractive index. Section IV is devoted to a
periodic slab with a piecewise constant refractive index
profile. The paper is concluded by some remarks and
discussions in Sec. V.
II.

EIGENMODES ON 1D STRUCTURES

We consider a 1D dielectric wave-guiding structure surrounded by air. A Cartesian coordinate system is chosen so that the structure is perpendicular to the z axis.
The relative permittivity depends only on z and satisfies
ε(z) = 1 for |z| > b and ε(z) = ε1 (z) for |z| < b, where
ε1 (z) ≥ 1, max[ε1 (z)] > 1, and h = 2b is the thickness of
the structure. A uniform slab, shown in Fig. 1 below, is

a special case for which ε1 (z) is a constant.
Assuming the field is invariant in the x direction, a
transverse electric (TE) eigenmode of the structure is a
solution with its electric field component Ex given as
(1)

where φ(z) is the mode profile, β is the propagation constant, ω is the angular frequency, k = ω/c is the free space
wavenumber, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. The
function φ satisfies the following 1D Helmholtz equation
d2 φ
+ k 2 ε(z)φ = β 2 φ,
dz 2

The above can be derived by taking the partial derivative
of Eq. (2) with respect to β, multiplying the resulting
equation by φ (the complex conjugate of φ) and integrating with respect to z on (−∞, ∞). It is clear that for
β > 0, dk/dβ > 0, thus, the dispersion curves of guided
modes always have a positive slope. Equation (4) can be
written as

modes on the finite interval (−b, b) for z. Assuming β
is given, then k or k 2 can be regarded as the eigenvalue.
Alternatively, if k is given, then β or β 2 is the eigenvalue.
Since γ0 depends on the eigenvalue, the above formulation on the finite interval of z is nonlinear.
For a guided mode {β, k, φ(z)}, the derivative of k with
respect to β is given by
R∞

for −∞ < z < ∞, subject to boundary conditions that
determine the physical nature of the solution.
Guided modes are solutions for real β and real k, such
that φ(z) → 0 as z → ±∞. For |z| > b, Eq. (2) is reduced
to d2 φ/dz 2 + (k 2 − β 2 )φ = 0, and the solutions are either
oscillatory or exponential depending on whether k 2 −β 2 is
positive or negative. Therefore, guided modes only exist
when k < |β|, that is, below the lightline. Moreover, the
guided modes satisfy the following boundary condition
dφ
= ∓γ0 φ at z = ±b,
(3)
dz
p
where γ0 =
β 2 − k 2 . Equation (2) for |z| < b and
Eq. (3) give rise to an eigenvalue problem of the guided

Therefore, as the dispersion curve approaches the lightline for β > 0, we have β/k → 1, γ0 → 0 and dk/dβ → 1.
In other words, at the limiting points on the lightline,
the dispersion curves of guided modes are tangential to
the lightline.
For real β and real k < |β|, Eq. (2) also has solutions
that blow up at infinity, i.e., φ(z) → ∞ as z → ±∞.
These solutions have been referred to as improper modes
[20, 21], and they satisfy the boundary condition
dφ
= ±γ0 φ
dz

at z = ±b.

(5)

The improper modes are unphysical when they are considered on the infinite interval of z, but they have physical
meaning on any bounded interval (−D, D) for D > b. If
we put proper waveguides with high refractive indices in
z > D and z < −D, respectively, a supermode of the
multilayered structure may have the same β and same k
as the improper mode, and the mode profile of the supermode is then identical to that of the improper mode
for z ∈ (−D, D).
Resonant modes are solutions of the Helmholtz equation for real β and complex k (i.e., complex ω) that exhibit outgoing wave behavior as z → ±∞. They radiate power to infinity and decay with time. Under the
time dependence given
p in Eq. (1), we have Im(ω) < 0.
If we define α0 =
k 2 − β 2 based on the standard
complex square root with the real negative axis as the
branch cut, then φ(z) = φ(b)eiα0 (z−b) for z > b and
φ(z) = φ(−b)e−iα0 (z+b) for z < −b. Therefore, the resonant modes satisfy the following boundary conditions
dφ
= ±iα0 φ at z = ±b.

(8)

If k is complex, then Re(α0 ) > 0 due to the definition
of the square root, and Eq. (8) gives Im(k) < 0. This is
consistent with the requirement that the resonant modes
should decay with time. In addition, we have Im(α0 ) < 0,
thus φ blows up as z → ±∞. The resonant modes are
usually studied above the lightline, that is for Re(k) >
|β|. In general, as Re(k) → β, Im(k) and α0 do not tend
to 0, thus, the resonant modes and guided modes are not
connected on the lightline. In latter sections, we show
that the resonant modes continue their existence below
the lightline.
If {k, φ} is a resonant mode for a real β, then {k̄, φ̄} is
another solution of Eq. (2) for the same β. If we denote
that solution also by {k, φ}, then it satisfies
dφ
= ∓iα0 φ at z = ±b.
dz

(9)

For the time dependence given in Eq. (1), a solution satisfying Eqs. (2) and (9) represents the time reversal of
a resonant mode. The field consists of incoming waves
from z = ±∞ and its amplitude grows with time. On the
other hand, if we replace the the time dependence by eiωt ,
then a resonant mode satisfies Eq. (9) and its time reversal satisfies Eq. (6). We point out that both the resonant
modes and their time
p reversals satisfy boundary condition (5), with γ0 = β 2 − k 2 defined using the standard
complex square root. This is so, because for a resonant
mode, Im(k) < 0, thus Im(β 2 − k 2 ) > 0, Im(γ0 ) > 0,
and γ0 = iα0 ; and for the time reversal of the resonant
mode, Im(k) > 0, thus Im(β 2 − k 2 ) < 0, Im(γ0 ) < 0, and
γ0 = −iα0 . Therefore, the boundary condition (5) allows
us to unify the improper modes, the resonant modes and
their time reversals. Actually, this is quite natural, since
all these modes blow up as z → ±∞.
For optical waveguides, leaky modes with real frequencies and complex propagation constants are widely studied [1]. Under the dependence on t and y given in Eq. (1),
the mode profile satisfies the same Helmholtz equation
(2). Notice that a leaky mode with Re(β) > 0 should
have Im(β) > 0, so that as it propagates forward in
the positive y direction, it radiates power to infinity (for
z → ±∞), and its amplitude decreases. If {β, φ} is a
leaky mode, then its complex conjugate {β̄, φ̄} represents
a time reversed solution that increases as it propagates

forward by gaining power coming from infinity (i.e., from
z = ±∞). Alternatively, {β̄, φ̄} can also be regarded as
a leaky mode with the dependence on t and y switched
to ei(ωt−βy) . Once again, the boundary condition (5) is
applicable to both leaky modes and their time reversals.
In summary, a 1D dielectric wave-guiding structure
supports guided and improper modes for real β and real
k, resonant modes and their time reversals for real β and
complex k, leaky modes and their time reversals for real
real k and complex β. Except for the guided modes, all
other modes blow up as z → ±∞ and satisfy boundary
condition (5).

UNIFORM SLAB: NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we present numerical results for a
uniform slab with a constant refractive index, that is,
ε(z) = ε1 , a constant, for −b < z < b. Due to reflection
symmetry with respect to the mid-plane of the slab, the
eigenmodes are either even in z or odd in z. For the even
and odd modes, the mode profile can normalized by the
condition φ(b) = 1, and be written as
φ(z) =

cos(γ1 z)
cos(γ1 b)

or φ(z) =

sin(γ1 z)
sin(γ1 b)

p
for |z| < b, respectively, where γ1 = k 2 ε1 − β 2 .
For the guided modes, we have φ(z) = e−γ0 (z−b) for
z > b, then the continuity of dφ/dz at z = b gives us the
following equation
e2iγ1 b ∓

iγ0 + γ1
= 0,
iγ0 − γ1

(10)

where the + and − signs correspond to the even and
odd modes, respectively. The guided modes form discrete
branches below the lightline, and m-th dispersion curve
approaches the lightline (k = β) at
πPm
k = β = km = √
d ε1 − 1

(11)

where Pm = m for the even modes and Pm = m − 1/2
for the odd modes, and m ≥ 1.
For the improper, resonant and leaky modes, and their
time reversals, we need to use boundary condition (5),
and thus φ(z) = eγ0 (z−b) for z > b. From the continuity
of dφ/dz at z = b, we obtain
e2iγ1 b ∓

γ0 + iγ1
= 0.
γ0 − iγ1

(12)

Again, the + and − signs correspond to the even and
odd modes, respectively.
To find the dispersion relations of various modes, we
only have to solve Eqs. (10) and (12). As a numerical
example, we consider a slab with ε1 = 11.56. In Figs. 2a
and 2b, we show the dispersion curves of the first four

4
odd and even modes, respectively. In particular, we show
Re(k)h for the resonant modes and Re(β)h for the leaky
modes. The guided, resonant, leaky and improper modes
are shown in red, black, cyan and blue, respectively. Notice that there is no odd leaky mode for m = 1.
From Fig. 2, we observe that the resonant modes approach the lightline near the starting points of the guided
modes, but actually these two kind of modes are not
connected on the lightline. In Fig. 3, we show the first

odd and even modes near the lightline. The red, black
and blue curves correspond to guided, resonant and improper modes, respectively. The guided modes converge
to the lightline tangentially, confirming the theoretical
result given in Sec. II. For the resonant modes (and their
time reversals), we show Re(kh) in Figs. 3a and 3b, and
Im(kh) in Figs. 3c and 3d. Figures 3a and 3c show the
first odd mode, and Figs. 3b and 3d correspond to the
first even mode. Notice that the resonant mode and its
time reversal exist below the lightline until they reach
an EP, beyond which a pair of improper modes emerge.
More precisely, as β increases through the EP, a complex
conjugate pair of k (for a resonant mode and its time
reversal) is turned to two different real values of k corresponding to two improper modes. In addition, Im(k)
and Re(k) exhibit a one-sided square root splitting before and after the EP, respectively. When β is further
increased, one branch of the improper modes converge to
the lightline at exactly the same point where a branch
of guided modes emerges. The higher order modes (with
m > 1) have exactly the same behavior.

The EPs separating resonant and improper modes can
be easily calculated, since they correspond to dk/dβ =
∞. From Eq. (12) and its derivative, we obtain the following system

PERIODIC SLAB

In this section, we consider a simple two-dimensional
(2D) dielectric structure, that is, a periodic slab with
two uniform segments, and show that the resonant and
guided modes of the periodic slab are also linked under the lightline through EPs and improper modes. A

Leaky modes with real k and complex β are also shown
in Fig. 2. It is known that the leaky modes are connected
to the improper modes [20, 21]. In fact, leaky modes
emerge from local minima of the dispersion curves of the
improper modes. For the uniform slab considered in this
section, there is no leaky mode associated with the lowest
odd improper mode (m = 1), since for that mode, k
decreases monotonically as β is increased. In Figs. 4a
and 4c, we show the dispersion curves, kh versus Re(β)h,
for the second odd mode (m = 2) and the first even mode
(m = 1). The imaginary parts of βh are shown in Figs. 4b
and 4d. The red, blue and magenta curves correspond
to the guided, improper and leaky modes, respectively.
It is clear that as k is decreased, two real β (for two
improper modes) are turned to a complex conjugate pair
of β through an EP. The complex conjugate pair of β
represents a leaky mode and its time reversal.
The EPs separating the leaky and improper modes can
also be easily calculated, since they satisfy the necessary
condition dk/dβ = 0. From Eq. (12) and its derivative,
we obtain the following system

γ1 − γ0 tan(γ1 b) − bγ1 γ0 sec2 (γ1 b) = 0,
γ1 tan(γ1 b) + γ0 = 0

is perpendicular to the slab, the xy plane is the mid-plane
of the slab, h = 2b is the slab thickness, d is the period
in the y direction, a and d − a are the widths of the two
uniform segments with dielectric constants ε1 and ε2 , respectively. The slab is invariant in the x direction and
surrounded by air (for z > b and z < −b).

6
Similar to Sec. II, we give definitions and boundary
conditions for various modes on the periodic slab. For
the E-polarization, the x component of the electric field
is assumed to be Ex = Re(u e−iωt ), where u = u(y, z)
satisfies the following 2D Helmholtz equation
∂y2 u + ∂z2 u + k 2 ε(y, z)u = 0,

(17)

and ε is the dielectric function. A Bloch mode of the
periodic slab is a solution of Eq. (17) given in the form
u(y, z) = φ(y, z) eiβy ,

(18)

where β is the Bloch wavenumber and φ(y, z) is periodic
in y with period d. Thus, u is quasi-periodic in y satisfying
u(y + d, z) = eiβd u(y, z).

(19)

On a lossless dielectric slab, a guided Bloch mode has
a real β and a real k (i.e., a real frequency), and decays
exponentially away from the slab (i.e., as z → ±∞). Due
to the periodicity in y, it is only necessary to consider β
in the interval [−π/d, π/d]. Below the lightline (i.e., for
k < |β|), guided modes exist continuously with respect
to β or k. For |z| > b, the wave field of a guided mode
(below the lightline) can be expanded in evanescent plane
waves as
u(y, z) =

±z > b,

where û±
m are expansion coefficients, and
p

βm = β + 2πm/d, γm = βm

(20)

(21)

Notice that β0 = β, all γm are positive, γ0 is identical
to that defined in Sec. II, but γ1 is different from that of
Sec. III. If we define a linear operator Λ = Λ(β, k), such
that
Λeiβm y = −γm eiβm y ,

m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...

(22)

then the guide mode satisfies the following boundary condition
∂z u = ±Λu,

z = ±b.

(23)

A Bloch resonant mode on any 2D open periodic structure is a solution that radiates power to infinity and decays with time. It is given in Eq. (18) for a real β and a
complex k (or ω) with Im(k) < 0. Resonant modes are
usually studied above the lightline, i.e., for Re(k) > |β|.
For |z| > b, the wave field of a resonant mode can also be
expanded, but one or more terms in Eq (20) must be replaced by outgoing waves with growing amplitudes. For
simplicity, we concentrate on resonant modes with only
one outgoing wave component. In that case, the wave
field can be written as
iβ0 y±γ0 z
u(y, z) = û±
0e
X
iβm y∓γm z

û±
,

m6=0

±z > b.

(24)

Notice that the sign for γ0 z is switched. In the above, βm
and γm are still given in Eq. (21), but all γm are complex
and they are defined using the standard complex square
root with a branch cut on the negative real axis. Since
k has a negative imaginary part, β 2 − k 2 is in the upper
complex half-plane, thus γ0 is in the first quadrant. Since
Im(γ0 ) > 0, the term eγ0 z represents a plane wave propagating towards z = +∞. Since Re(γ0 ) is also positive,
the amplitude of that plane wave grows exponentially as
z → +∞. If we define a linear operator Λ0 = Λ0 (β, k)
satisfying Eq. (22) for all m 6= 0 and
Λ0 eiβ0 y = γ0 eiβ0 y ,

(25)

then the resonant mode satisfies the boundary condition
∂z u = ±Λ0 u,

z = ±b.

(26)

We emphasize that Eqs. (24) and (26) are valid for resonant modes with only one radiation channel (i.e. the
plane wave for m = 0) in each side of the periodic slab.
If {u, β, k} is a resonant mode, then u (the complex
conjugate of u) satisfies Helmholtz equation (17) with k
replaced by k. If u is considered with the original time
dependence, that is, assuming Ex = Re(u e−iωt ), then
it represents a solution that grows with time. From the
complex conjugate of Eq. (24), we see that u contains the
term e−iβy+γ 0 z for z > b, and it represents an incoming
wave from z = +∞. Therefore, u represents the timereversal of a resonant mode, it gains power from incoming
waves and grows with time. However, u does not satisfy
boundary condition (26) with Λ0 = Λ0 (β, k), because it
has a quasi-periodicity in y corresponding to −β (instead
of β). Nevertheless, corresponding to the pair (β, k) of
a resonant mode u, there is another resonant mode v
with Bloch wavenumber −β and the same k. The complex conjugate of v satisfies Eq. (26) with Λ0 = Λ0 (β, k).
Therefore, when Eq. (17) is solved with boundary conditions (19) and (26), we should obtain complex conjugate
pairs k and k. Assuming Im(k) < 0, then the solution u
corresponding to k is a resonant mode that decays with
time, and the solution v corresponding to k can be regarded as the time-reversal of a resonant mode v which
has the same complex frequency as u but propagates in
the opposite direction in y.
Like the the uniform slab, the periodic slab also has improper modes (for real k and real β) that grow exponentially as z → ±∞. Since the wave field can be expanded
in plane waves for |z| > b, there are different improper
modes depending on how many of these terms are exponentially increasing. For an improper Bloch mode under
the lightline with only one exponentially increasing term
for z → +∞ and z → −∞, respectively, the expansion
(24) is also valid. Therefore, these improper modes satisfy boundary condition (26).
For the periodic slab, Eq. (17) also has solutions with
real k (i.e. real frequency) and complex β. A leaky Bloch
mode is a solution that radiates power to the surrounding homogeneous media (i.e. to z = ±∞) and decreases

7
with y as it propagates forward. If a leaky mode propagates in the positive y direction, then the imaginary
part of its complex Bloch wavenumber β must be positive. Assuming the leaky mode has only one radiation
channel corresponding to m = 0, we claim that it also
satisfies Eq. (24) and boundary condition (26). For such
a leaky mode, we have Im(γ0 ) > 0, thus the plane wave
eiβy+γ0 z radiates power to z = +∞. Similar to the case
for resonant modes, when a leaky mode is found by solving Eq. (17) together with boundary conditions (19) and
(26), we also obtain a solution with β. If that solution is
also considered with the time dependence e−iωt , it represents the time-reversal of a leaky modes, namely, it gains
power from infinity and grows as it propagates forward.
Using a highly accurate numerical method [12], we calculate guided, resonant, improper and leaky modes for a
periodic slab. In Fig. 6, we show the first two odd modes
(odd in z) for a periodic slab with ε1 = 11.56, ε2 = 1,
a = 0.5d and h = d. The guided, resonant and improper
modes are shown in red, black and blue, respectively.
In the left panel, only the real part of k is shown for
the resonant modes. The middle and right panels show
details around the starting points of the guided modes
on the lightline. It is clear that the resonant modes are
not directly connected to the guided modes. Instead,
as the Bloch wavenumber β is increased, the resonant
modes continue their existence under the lightline (i.e.,
for Re(k) < |β|), end at EPs where pairs of improper
modes emerge, and the upper branches of the improper
modes approach the lightline at exactly the same points
where the guided modes emerge. Two lower panels in
Fig. 6 show the imaginary parts of k and k, corresponding
to the resonant modes and their time-reversals. Therefore, although the resonant and guided modes are not directly connected, they are indirectly linked via EPs and
improper modes. This appears to be true for both uniform and periodic slabs.
From the results of Sec. III, we expect the leaky modes
to emerge from local minima of the dispersion curves of
improper modes. Since the two improper modes shown in
Fig. 6 do not have local minima for β ∈ [0, π/d], we turn
to a periodic slab with a different parameter. In the left
panel of Fig. 7, we show two even modes (even in y) for a
periodic slab with thickness h = 3d and the same ε1 , ε2
and a. The red, black, blue and cyan curves correspond
to the guided, resonant, improper and leaky modes, respectively. It is clear that the lower improper mode (with
smaller k) has a local minimum, and a leaky mode and
its time-reversal appear as k is decreased. The minimum
point is an EP for the non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem formulated using Eq. (24) or Eq. (26), and it occurs
at k = 0.1323(2π/d). The middle and right panels of
Fig. 7 show more details around the EP. The real and

imaginary parts of β and β are shown in the middle and
right panels, respectively. As we have discussed earlier, a
leaky mode is associated with a complex β with positive
imaginary part, and its time-reversal is associated with
β.

CONCLUSION

A uniform or periodic dielectric slab works as an optical waveguide or a diffraction structure, depending on
whether light is propagating in or illuminated on the slab.
For waveguides, it is important to study guided modes,
as well as leaky modes with complex propagation constants. For diffraction structures, resonant modes are
highly relevant for various applications. Resonant modes
are usually studied above the lightline, they approach
the lightline with a nonzero imaginary part in their complex frequencies, and are not connected with the guided
modes on the lightline. In this paper, using a more inclusive eigenvalue formulation and highly accurate numerical methods, we found an indirect link between the resonant and guided modes for uniform and periodic slabs.
Such a link exists below the lightline, and contains an EP
and improper modes. We also show that the leaky modes
are related to the improper modes and emerge from EPs
when frequency is regarded as the parameter.
Many existing studies on resonant and guided modes
use eigenvalue formulations that are supposed to be valid
for both guided and resonant modes. Numerical studies
often use perfectly matched layers (PMLs) [22, 23] that
force resonant modes (with outgoing wave components)
to decay in the surrounding homogeneous media, and be
compatible with the guided modes. Studies based on
these formulations cannot find the indirect link, because
they are incompatible with the improper modes. We have
used one formulation for the guided modes, and another
formulation for all modes that blow up at infinity. The
second formulation is valid for resonant, leaky and improper modes, and the time-reversals of the resonant and
leaky modes, and it allows us to identify the branching
points between resonant (or leaky) and improper modes
as EPs. Our study provides a complete picture for eigenmode structures on uniform and periodic slabs. We expect the main conclusions remain valid for more complicated structures, including biperiodic structures such as
photonic crystal slabs.
