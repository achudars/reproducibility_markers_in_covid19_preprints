ABSTRACT
Context. The observation of total and linearly polarized synchrotron radiation of spiral galaxies in the radio continuum reveals the

distribution and structure of their magnetic fields. By observing these, information about the proposed dynamo processes that preserve
the large-scale magnetic fields in spiral galaxies can be gained. Additionally, by analyzing the synchrotron intensity, the transport
processes of cosmic rays into the halo of edge-on spiral galaxies can be investigated.
Aims. We analyze the magnetic field geometry and the transport processes of the cosmic rays of the edge-on spiral starburst galaxy
NGC 4666 from CHANG-ES radio data in two frequencies; 6 GHz (C-band) and 1.5 GHz (L-band). Supplementary X-ray data are
used to investigate the hot gas in NGC 4666.
Methods. We determine the radio scale heights of total power emission at both frequencies for this galaxy. We show the magnetic
field orientations derived from the polarization data. Using rotation measure (RM) synthesis we further study the behavior of the
RM values along the disk in C-band to investigate the large-scale magnetic-field pattern. We use the revised equipartition formula to
calculate a map of the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we model the processes of cosmic-ray transport into the halo with the 1D
SPINNAKER model.
Results. The extended radio halo of NGC 4666 is box-shaped and is probably produced by the previously observed supernova-driven
superwind. This is supported by our finding of an advective cosmic-ray transport such as that expected for a galactic wind. The scaleheight analysis revealed an asymmetric halo above and below the disk as well as between the two sides of the major axis. A central
point source as well as a bubble structure is seen in the radio data for the first time. Our X-ray data show a box-shaped hot halo around
NGC 4666 and furthermore confirm the AGN nature of the central source. NGC 4666 has a large-scale X-shaped magnetic field in
the halo, as has been observed in other edge-on galaxies. The analysis furthermore revealed that the disk of NGC 4666 shows hints of
field reversals along its radius, which is the first detection of this phenomenon in an external galaxy.

1. Introduction
Strong star formation leads to outflow of matter over the whole
disk of a galaxy (e.g., Habe et al. 1981). In addition to gas, cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields play an important role in
the disk-halo interaction of galaxies, which leads to the formation of radio halos in galaxies (e.g., Parker 1992). Observations
of radio halos in polarization reveal that star-forming galaxies
often show X-shaped magnetic-field structures if observed edgeon (Tüllmann et al. 2000; Krause 2009). Several mechanisms to
generate and maintain large-scale regular magnetic fields in spiral galaxies have been proposed. One mechanism is the meanfield α − ω dynamo (see e.g., Ruzmaikin et al. 1988; Beck et al.
1996; Chamandy 2016). Shear motions due to differential rota-

tion combined with the coriolis force acting on the vertical turbulent gas motions amplify and order large-scale regular magnetic
fields from turbulent magnetic fields in spiral galaxies (e.g., Arshakian et al. 2009). The solutions of the α − ω dynamo equation
in the thin-disk approximation are different dynamo modes, like
the axisymmetric spiral magnetic field (ASS) or the bisymmetric
spiral magnetic field (BSS). These fields in the galactic disk are
generally accompanied by poloidal magnetic fields of even or
odd symmetry extending into the galactic halo. However, these
magnetic fields are, according to the thin-disk α − ω dynamo, a
factor of about ten weaker than the disk fields and, hence, cannot
explain the halo fields that are observed to be almost as strong
as the disk fields. One reason for this discrepancy could be that

the magneto-ionic disk of galaxies is not thin, due to outflows
for example.
The complex behavior of galactic dynamos is not fully understood yet, and the influence of galactic outflows in particular is still a topic of discussion. Outflows can order a turbulentdisk magnetic field such that it evolves into a regular halo field
in dwarf galaxies (Moss & Sokoloff 2017). In Milky Way-type
spiral galaxies, galactic outflows lead to two countervailing effects: They are crucial to remove small-scale helicity and hence
to avoid quenching of dynamo action, but also lead to field losses
into the halo that are responsible for the saturation of the dynamo
(e.g., Bendre et al. 2015; Chamandy et al. 2015).
In this paper, the radio halo of the edge-on spiral starburst
galaxy NGC 4666 is investigated to obtain further clues about
the magnetic fields and processes in spiral galaxies with high
star formation rates (SFRs). With the data of NGC 4666 from
the Continuum HAlos in Nearby Galaxies - an Evla Survey
(CHANG-ES), observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), it is possible to analyze the galaxy in C-band (6 GHz)
and L-band (1.5 GHz) in terms of linear polarization, the magnetic field structure, and transport processes.
NGC 4666 is an actively star-forming spiral galaxy at a
distance of 27.5 Mpc (Wiegert et al. 2015). The basic galaxy
parameters are listed in Table 1. In the optical spectral range
the star-forming disk is slightly visible. Therefore, the inclination of NGC 4666 is less than 90◦ . NGC 4666 is a starburst
galaxy (Lehnert & Heckman 1996) and is considered a superwind galaxy with a prominent X-ray halo (Dahlem et al. 1997;
Tüllmann et al. 2006). An outflow cone is associated with a
galactic superwind, which can be described as a global outflow
powered by the combined effect of supernova (SN) explosions
and stellar winds associated with powerful starbursts (Heckman
et al. 1993).
In Heesen et al. (2018), archival Very Large Array (VLA)
data of NGC 4666 and other galaxies were used to model the
CR transport with the 1D transport model SPINNAKER. For
NGC 4666, transport by advection was concluded with a very
high advection speed between 500 km s−1 and 700 km s−1 supporting the starburst phase of this galaxy.
With an SFR of 7.3 M yr−1 (Wiegert et al. 2015), NGC 4666
is very similar to the CHANG-ES galaxy NGC 5775. Like other
starburst galaxies, NGC 4666 is also a member of an interacting system. It is part of a small group of galaxies containing
also NGC 4632 and NGC 4668 (Garcia 1993). A small dwarf
galaxy, which is also part of the group, was discovered by Walter et al. (2004). The HI data of Walter et al. (2004) show strong
interaction between NGC 4666 and NGC 4668 as well as with
the dwarf galaxy. The strong starburst is triggered by ongoing
far-field gravitational interactions (Walter et al. 2004). The Hα
image and the radio continuum maps (Dahlem et al. 1997) show
a homogeneous distribution of many star-forming regions across
the disk of NGC 4666. This is different from a nuclear starburst
galaxy with a 1 kpc diameter of high star formation in the center. It is not clear why the star formation in NGC 4666 is widely
spread along the disk and therefore looks different from many
other starburst galaxies (Walter et al. 2004). Furthermore, the Hα
image (Dahlem et al. 1997) shows outflow of filaments, which is
represented by the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) and caused by the
strong starburst. The X-ray data (Tüllmann et al. 2000) indicate
a large X-ray halo. The outflow of the hot X-ray emitting gas
is comparable to the size of the disk and may even extend radially beyond the Hα filaments. Additionally, a nuclear outflow
(bubble structure to the southeast) is visible in the X-ray image.

NGC 4666 hosts a modestly active galactic nucleus (AGN)
(Dahlem et al. 1997; Persic et al. 2004), which is probably highly
obscured (Dudik et al. 2005). Based on BeppoSAX and XMM
Newton data, Persic et al. (2004) found that the star burst, which
extends over most of the disk, and AGN activities coexist in
NGC 4666. They found a prominent emission line from Fe-Kα
at ≈ 6.4 keV from the nuclear region. Additionally, they observed the presence of a flat continuum that is in agreement with
a model in which the continuum originates from the reflection
of the primary continuum by the cold inner wall of the circumnuclear torus in the nuclear region. They conclude the existence
of a strongly absorbed (i.e., Compton-thick) AGN. The optical
emission lines of spectroscopic measurements from the core region of Dahlem et al. (1997) also suggest a central AGN. In a
further study of high-resolution X-ray imaging of nearby lowionisation nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) observed by
Chandra, a nuclear point source of NGC 4666 was not detected
(Dudik et al. 2005). They concluded either a lack of an energetically significant AGN or a highly obscured AGN with internal absorptions reaching 1.1 × 1023 cm−2 to 8.4 × 1024 cm−2 ,
which would imply that the AGN shows luminosities between
2 × 1038 erg s−1 and 9.5 × 1042 erg s−1 . No nuclear (point source)
flux density has been determined so far in the radio wavelength
regime as the resolution of the observations was insufficient.

band data of NGC 4666 complement the polarization data. With
supplementary X-ray data from XMM-Newton we are able to
support the AGN classification of the central source and analyze the far-extended X-ray halo, which seems to be correlated
to the radio halo. With the radio data we are able to investigate
the disk magnetic field, which is axisymmetric with hints of one
reversal. After the thermal/nonthermal separation, the magnetic
field strength is determined. We further use the 1D SPINNAKER
model for cosmic-ray transport in NGC 4666.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an
overview of the data and the adapted technique of rotation measure (RM) synthesis. In Section 3 the results of Stokes I, the
polarization using RM synthesis, the disk field of NGC 4666,
and the maps of the magnetic field strength using equipartition
are presented. The 1D transport model is applied to the data. The
magnetic field distribution from that model is then compared to
the equipartition field. In Section 4 the results are summarized
and conclusions are drawn.

2. Observations and data analysis
2.1. VLA data
2.1.1. CHANG-ES data

The radio continuum data are part of the CHANG-ES survey observed with the Karl G. Jansky VLA (Irwin et al. 2012a). Observations were obtained in B-, C-, and D-configurations at L-band
(1.5 GHz, 500 MHz bandwidth, with a gap of 144 MHz width
where strong radio frequency interference (RFI) is located), and
in the C- and D-configurations at C-band (6 GHz, 2 GHz bandwidth). We used 2048 spectral channels in 32 spectral windows
(spws) at 1.5 GHz and 1024 channels in 16 spws at 6 GHz. All
polarization products (Stokes I, Q, U, and V) were obtained. The
D-configuration data (Wiegert et al. 2015) are public1 and the Cconfiguration data will become public soon (Walterbos et al. in
prep).
The data reduction for Stokes I (total power) and Stokes
Q and U (linear polarization) was carried out for all five data
sets of NGC 4666 (see Table 2) separately, using the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package (McMullin et al. 2007) and following the calibration procedures as
described in the CHANG-ES paper by Irwin et al. (2013). We
used J1331+3030 (3C286) as the primary calibrator, J1246-0730
as the secondary calibrator, and J1407+2827 as the zero polarization calibrator. The calibrated data from the different configurations were then combined for C-band and L-band and these
combined data were used for imaging Stokes I and the polarization.

The Stokes I maps were produced by cleaning with a robust
weighting parameter of zero (Briggs 1995). The polarization and
magnetic-field-orientation maps were created from the Stokes Q
and U maps, which were cleaned with a robust parameter of two
in order to be more sensitive to faint structures. The achieved rms
from the combined C-band data for Stokes I is 4.6 µJy/beam with
a beam of 3.0" × 3.5". The resulting rms of the combined L-band
data for Stokes I is 30 µJy/beam with a beam of 11.8" × 13.6".
Subsequently, smoothed images of Stokes I of both bands were
produced to match the resolution of the polarization maps of 7",
as well as the resolution of the maps from RM synthesis of 18".
2.1.2. Archival VLA data

Archival VLA D-configuration C-band observations exist for
the galaxy NGC 4666 (Program AD326). These observations
were obtained before the upgrade of the VLA. The central frequency was 4.86 GHz with a bandwidth of 2x50 MHz. The calibration was done using the Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS2 ) with J1331+305 (3C286) as the primary calibrator
and J1246-075 as the secondary calibrator. The primary calibrator was also used for polarisation-angle correction and the secondary calibrator for polarisation leakage term determination.
The Stokes I maps were produced by cleaning with robust
zero weighting. The polarization and magnetic-field-orientation
maps were created from the Stokes Q and Stokes U maps, which
were also cleaned with robust zero weighting. The application of
RM synthesis on these data is not possible as they consist of just
two channels.
2.2. XMM data

To study the nature of the possible central source, as well as of
the galactic energy budget via analysis of the emission from the
hot gas, XMM-Newton archive data for NGC 4666 were used
(see Table 4 for the parameters of the observations). The data
were processed using the SAS 15.0.0 package (Gabriel et al.
2004) with standard reduction procedures. The tasks epchain
and emchain helped to obtain event lists for two EPIC-MOS
cameras (Turner et al. 2001) and the EPIC-pn camera (Strüder
et al. 2001). The event lists were then carefully filtered for periods of intense background radiation. From the output data an
image in the soft energy range of 0.2-1 keV was produced, along
with the exposure map (without vignetting correction) masked
for the acceptable detector area using the images script3 , modified by the authors to allow adaptive smoothing.
Furthermore, a spectral analysis was performed. The spectra of each region were created using all three EPIC cameras.
The background spectra were obtained using blank sky-event
lists (see Carter & Read 2007), filtered using the same procedures as for the source-event lists. For each spectrum, response
matrices and effective area files were produced. Next, including

these ancillary files, spectra from all three EPIC cameras and
the corresponding background blank sky spectra were merged
using the SAS task epicspeccombine into a final background
subtracted source spectrum. Finally, the spectra were fitted using
XSPEC 12 (Arnaud 1996).

2.3. RM synthesis

While propagating through a magnetized plasma, electromagnetic waves experience a frequency dependent rotation of the
polarization angle. This effect is called Faraday rotation and is
caused by the different propagation speeds of the left and right
circular polarized waves. The rotation of the polarization angle
χ is proportional to the wavelength (λ) squared and the RM:
(1)

If different regions along the line of sight emit polarized intensity and/or rotate the polarization angle, RM has to be replaced by the Faraday depth Φ (Burn 1966):

with the electron density ne and the magnetic field integrated

With the method of RM synthesis applied to wide-band
multi-channel receiver data, multiple sources along the line of
sight can be measured (Brentjens & de Bruyn 2005). The basic idea was introduced by Burn (1966) who defined a complex
“Faraday dispersion function”, which connects the complex polarized surface brightness in Faraday depth space via a Fourier
transform with the dependence of the complex polarized surface
brightness in λ2 -space. When applying this technique, several
parameters are important, which are presented in Table 5.
In order to find out if each channel has to be imaged for
Stokes Q and U or if it is sufficient to image every spw, we
calculated the rotation over both frequency bands. There are 32
spws in L-band and 16 spws in C-band. Each spw contains 64
channels before flagging. Since the rotation of the electromagnetic wave is calculated as λ2 multiplied by the RM, the rotation
of the polarization angle χ can be estimated. A median value of
|RM| ≈ 100 rad m−2 was found in external galaxies (e.g., Fletcher

Standard imaging averages over the entire bandwidth, which
in L-band leads to strong depolarization across the frequency
band and no information on the RM is gained. By imaging each
spw separately, the rotation of the polarization vector (in the
above example 192.5◦ ) can be lowered by a factor of 32 in
L-band, which is sufficient (in the above example the rotation
within the individual spw is then ∼ 6◦ ). Due to the wavelength
dependence, this effect is not as strong in C-band.

and the C-band ranging in frequency from 5 to 7 GHz (wavelength range between λ = 0.06 m and λ = 0.042 m) the rotation
of the polarization angle ∆χ can be calculated:

(from Brentjens & de Bruyn (2005)).

From the data in Xu & Han (2014), the Galactic foreground
RM in the direction to NGC 4666 was determined. This value
(RMforeground = −5.8 ± 1.3 rad m−2 ) was subtracted from the
final RM cube.
To adopt RM synthesis, Stokes Q and Stokes U images for
each spw were produced. These have to be convolved to the
largest beam in the frequency range (the beam size being dependent on frequency). Due to RFI in L-band, spws 0, 1, and 2 were
flagged before all images were merged together into an image
cube with the frequency as the third axis. This was done for the
Stokes Q and U images separately. Then the script "RMsynth"
(B. Adebahr, private communication, based on Brentjens & de
Bruyn (2005)) was applied. A Fourier transformation was performed on the complex flux densities of the cubes in λ2 -space.
The result was a cube with the two image axes and Φ as the third
axis. Then the RM of a single source along the line of sight was
determined by fitting, for example, a parabola to the main peak
of F(Φ) (Brentjens & de Bruyn 2005). The result was a cube
of Stokes Q and U, as well as a polarization cube, which was

then further analyzed to obtain, for example, the RM, the polarized intensity (PI), and the polarization angle (PA), as well as
their corresponding error maps. The RM map represents the fitted peak position of each pixel, again assuming there is only one
component along the line of sight.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Radio continuum Stokes I

The total power map (Stokes I) of L-band is shown in Figure 1
with total intensity contours overlayed on the optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)4 image made from the ugr filters using
the formulas of Lupton 20055 . The radio halo in the combined
configuration of L-band (Figure 1) reaches up to 9 kpc above
and below the plane of the galaxy as measured to the 3-σ level
corrected for the beam size. The box-like appearance of the radio halo is quite striking. It is evident that the extent of the radio
continuum radiation beyond the star-forming disk only occurs in
the vertical direction of the galaxy. In Appendix A, we present
L-band contours from the B-, C-, and D-configurations of the
VLA, which result in different resolutions. The C-band data are
presented in the following section.
Dahlem et al. (2006) investigated possible parameters influencing the existence of radio halos. They found that galaxies
that show radio halos also have high energy input rates into their
interstellar medium (ISM) and high average dust temperatures.
These latter authors report that NGC 4666 shows the highest
total nonthermal radio power at 1.49 GHz in their sample with
a value of 34.1 × 1021 W Hz−1 . Li & Wang (2013) calculated
the total supernova (SN) mechanical energy injection rate to be
10.4 × 1038 erg s−1 , which is one of the highest in their sample.
The radius of star formation in NGC 4666, which was derived in Dahlem et al. (2006) via the radial extent of Hα emission, is quite high in comparison to the optical extent of the
galaxy. The radial extent of star formation was determined in this

in comparison to the radius of the major axis of 18 kpc, showing that NGC 4666 has widespread star formation across almost
the entire disk. This is very different from a classical starburst
galaxy with a central starburst. The SFR of 7.3 M yr−1 (Wiegert
et al. 2015) is the highest among the 35 edge-on galaxies in the
CHANG-ES sample. The star formation-driven winds originating from the wide-spread star forming regions may be an explanation to the box-like appearance of the halo as seen in Fig. 1.
The CHANG-ES observations of the galaxy NGC 5775
(Heald et al. in prep.) provide further evidence corroborating the
explanation for the box-like radio halo from above. This galaxy
is the only galaxy in the CHANG-ES sample that is comparable
to NGC 4666 with regard to its size and SFR, with the second
highest SFR of 5.3 M yr−1 (Wiegert et al. 2015). Furthermore,
neither is strongly dominated by its central object and in both
the star formation is widely spread over almost the entire disk.
NGC 5775 is also defined as a starburst and superwind galaxy
and shows a similarly boxy radio halo. The wind could be confined by the magnetic field lines of the disk, which mostly follow the spiral structure and reach into the halo (Henriksen &
Irwin 2016), thus resulting in a box-like structure of the radio
halo. NGC 4666 is a remarkable example of a clear connection
between the star-formation distribution in the disk and the morphology of the radio halo.
3.2. Integrated spectral distribution

The spectral index behavior of the integrated flux densities I
of NGC 4666 is shown in Figure 2. Other integrated fluxdensity measurements from the literature were selected from the
NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)6 and VizieR7 , complementing the two CHANG-ES flux densities from this work
(Table 6); only literature values with corresponding errors were
used. The fitted spectral slope is α = −0.68 ± 0.04 (where
I ∝ να ). This spectral index is typical for radio spectra with

3.3. Central point source
3.3.1. Radio continuum

The central point-like source is seen in both radio bands (at the
J2000 position RA 12h 45m 08.62s, DEC -00◦ 27’ 43.2"): in
the high-resolution B-configuration of L-band (see Appendix,
Fig. A.3, first panel) and in the combined image of C-band (Figure 3), as well as in the C-configuration alone, which is used for
the analysis performed here. These are the first detections in the
radio regime. To measure the flux density of the central source,
the images of both bands were smoothed to the same beam size
of 4" to allow for a better comparison of the measurements and
to ensure consistency. The flux density was then measured via a
Gaussian fit to the intensity profile after subtraction of the diffuse
flux density from the galaxy disk. We chose a circular region of
two times the size of the beam (at least twice the beam is recommended). The resulting error was very small8 and was therefore
analyzed further. The chosen region was varied from twice the
beam size to four times the beam size. The difference in the flux
density measurements was then taken to calculate a mean error.
The resulting radio spectral index of the nuclear flux density measurements is α = − 0.67 ± 0.12, which indicates a

synchrotron source. As some AGNs show circular polarisation,
Stokes V was imaged but did not show any signal in either band.
In Figure 3 the combined (C- + D-configurations) C-band
data are shown in gray scale with contours overlaid showing
the location of the central radio source. In the eastern direction
from the point source (gray contour) a bubble-like structure is
seen that may indicate a jet. This further strengthens the argument that the central source is an AGN. Other interesting features of NGC 4666 seen in Fig. 3 are the filamentary structures
to the western side of the galaxy. These are comparable to Hα
filaments emerging from the disk. With the new high-resolution
CHANG-ES data this structure is now seen in the radio regime.
Since the galaxy is classified as a superwind and starburst galaxy,
these structures are probably best explained by a galactic wind
from the disk and up into the halo. Therefore, the magnetic fields
as well as the CRs are transported with the wind. This would result in advection being the main transport process of CRs, which
agrees with what is found for this galaxy by Heesen et al. (2018);
this is further discussed in Section 3.11. Similar filamentary radio structures described as threads were found in the center of
the Milky Way by LaRosa et al. (2000).
The western and eastern side of the galaxy halo look very different in terms of this filamentary structure. Beside the bubblelike structure to the east there are also thin features of radio intensity in the halo on this side of the galaxy. They are not filamentary, but shell-like structures. A possible reason for this is
the ongoing interaction mainly occurring with NGC 4668 to the
eastern side of the galaxy which could bend this side of the halo.
Therefore, the two sides are affected differently.
3.3.2. XMM data

The analysis of the X-ray emission from the central source was
performed using additional components in the model fitted to
the spectrum from the disk region (Table 8). These include an
absorbed power law and a simple Gaussian, with the latter accounting for a weak but clearly visible iron Fe-Kα line at around
6.4 keV. This line is considered to be a typical fingerprint of an
AGN. Table 9 presents the parameters of the central source obtained from the fit, including the unabsorbed luminosity.

3.4. Further analysis of the XMM data

Figure 4 shows the large-scale emission from the hot gas in
NGC 4666. While the brightest emission comes from the central parts of the disk and the nuclear point-like source, the vertical outflows reach up to 9 kpc into the halo. The hot gas around
NGC 4666 is also box-shaped as seen in radio. Interestingly, the
bubble-like structure from the radio map coincides with a feature
in the X-rays to the southeast. The spectral analysis was performed for three regions of NGC 4666: The central disk region
was chosen to supplement the analysis of the magnetic fields
of NGC 4666 in radio and has a boxsize of 140" × 28". Two
additional regions of the same size on both sides of the disk region (east and west) were selected in order to look for possible
changes in the energy budget of the ISM in the disk outskirts, as
well as to study the emission for the hot gas in the galactic halo.
All regions are presented in Figure 5.
A complex model was used for the spectral analysis of the
emission from the disk region. It consisted of two gaseous components represented by a mekal model, which is an emission
spectrum from hot diffuse gas based on the model calculations of
Mewe and Kaastra (Mewe et al. 1985; Kaastra 1992), accounting for the emission from the hot gas in the disk and the halo

NGC 4666 on the DSS blue image.
of NGC 4666, and a power-law model to account for the unresolved point sources in the galactic disk. As mentioned above,
an additional absorbed power law and a simple Gaussian component were also used to account for the emission from the central
source.
The two remaining spectra (east and west regions) were fitted
with a model consisting of two mekals (hot gas from the disk
and the halo), as well as a power law (unresolved disk sources).
The spectra and the fitted models are presented in Figure 6 and
Table 8, and their fitted parameters in Tables 9 and 10.
The parameters from the mekal components of the model fit
were used to calculate electron densities, gas masses, thermal energies, and thermal energy densities of the hot gas. In our calculations we follow the widely accepted assumption that the cooler
component describes the hot gas in the halo, while the hotter corresponds to the hot gas in the disk (e.g., Tüllmann et al. 2006).
Another important assumption is the emitting volume of the hot
gas. In our calculations we assumed a disk thickness of 1 kpc.

emission (below 1 keV) of the halo below the disk. The hardness ratio map (Figure 7) confirms our expectations, the eastern
side of the disk being significantly harder than the western part.
Consequently, we assumed the path length through the halo of
NGC 4666 to be 20 kpc for the west region and 10 kpc for the
east region, which allows to account for different emitting volumes. All derived parameters of the hot gas both in the disk and
in the halo are presented in Table 11.
Under the assumption that hot gas and magnetic fields are
responsible for the observed Faraday RMs (Fig. 19), we used the
number densities of the hot gas derived from the X-ray spectra
and calculated the strengths of the large-scale field parallel to the
line of sight (Table 12). The resulting field strengths of 2–3 µG
are several times smaller than the strengths of the total field (see
Fig. 24), as expected from the action of a large-scale dynamo.
3.5. Scale heights

Fig. 6: Model fits to the regions of NGC 4666 (see Tables 8, 9,
and 10).
For the halo we needed to take into account the inclination of the
galaxy. The position of the spectral regions (Fig. 5) suggests that
about half of both east and west regions still include emission
from the disk. While in the latter region we expect the emission
from both the disk and the halo (we see the top side of the disk),
the east region might show a lower contribution from the soft
Article number, page 8 of 23

The intensity profile perpendicular to the major axis of edgeon galaxies can be best fitted by exponential or Gaussian functions. We follow the scale height determination undertaken for
13 CHANG-ES galaxies in Krause et al. (2018) to fit twocomponent exponentials to the radio intensity profiles. The scale
height analysis was carried out on the combined C-band and Lband data. To compare the results in both bands the maps were
smoothed to the same beam size of 13.3" × 13.3". We used the
"BoxModels" tool within the NOD3 software package (Müller
et al. 2017). The parameters of the analysis are presented in Table 13.
For NGC 4666 it is not easy to find good fit solutions with
two-component exponentials along the whole disk if the galaxy
is divided into different strips along the major axis. This is
mainly due to its asymmetry between the two sides of the major
axis. Therefore we used a box size of 130" × 6" to fit one intensity profile for the central galaxy, omitting the asymmetric outer
part (see Figure 10). Furthermore, an asymmetry was found
above and below the plane between the eastern and the western
halo. Therefore fits were undertaken separately for above and below the plane. The resulting fits and scale heights are presented
in Figures 8 and 9 as well as in Tables 14 and 15. We note that
with the inclination of 70◦ from Walter et al. (2004) we were
not able to fit the scale heights. Despite the fact that in optical
images of this galaxy the disk is clearly seen and thus cannot be
nearly 90◦ , we conclude from our analysis that the inclination is
rather 85◦ ± 2◦ .
The resulting mean scale heights of the thin disk are
0.41 ± 0.18 kpc and 0.74 ± 0.12 kpc for C-band and L-band,
respectively. The mean thick disk scale height in C-band is
1.57 ± 0.21 kpc and in L-band is 2.16 ± 0.36 kpc.
In Figure 11 the mass surface density (MSD) is plotted
against the normalized scale height for 13 CHANG-ES galax-

well as into the disk. There is no polarized intensity above 3σ
from the southern side of the galaxy, which is the receding side.
In Figure 14 (and Figure A.2) the L-band polarization data
are presented with intensity contours and magnetic field orientation on Stokes I using RM synthesis (the L-band Stokes I contours on polarized intensity).
In L-band, the Faraday rotation effect is quite strong, meaning that some polarization is expected to be depolarized and not
visible in the map. Without RM synthesis, polarized intensity in
L-band is only observed in a small fraction of the disk. After applying RM synthesis, a factor of 1.4 more polarized intensity can
be recovered, which is seen in Figure 14. The polarized emission
is distributed over the whole galaxy disk reaching into the halo.
Specifically, in the halo to the northwest of the galaxy, a large
polarized emission region is located with vertical field components. This region is also seen in the C-band data, but the emission does not reach as far out into the halo as in L-band. This
indicates a large-scale ordered magnetic field extending into the
halo. In summary, an X-shaped magnetic field structure is again
visible in the polarization map of L-band using RM synthesis.

the CHANG-ES observations, respectively. This leads to 20%
higher intensities (assuming an average spectral index of −0.8)
in the archival VLA maps. For the comparison of polarized emission in the halo, especially in the south, we take the difference in
central frequency into account by dividing the 4.86 GHz image
by 1.2 (assuming an average spectral index of −0.8). The difference between the polarized intensities in the south is less than
5σ.
Significant differences between the two observations are the
uv distribution and weighting as well as the integration time. The
much larger bandwidth of the CHANG-ES observations does not
compensate for the much shorter observation times compared to
the archival data.
3.6.3. RM maps

A further outcome of the RM synthesis is the RM map, which
represents the fitted peak position along the cube of each pixel.
It represents the mean magnetic field component along the line
of sight, where the value is positive for a field pointing towards
the observer and negative for a field pointing away from the observer. The RM map of C-band is shown in Figure 19 and the one
of L-band in Figure A.4. The RM values in C-band lie between
−200 and +200 rad/m2 . The L-band RM values are very different and between −14 and +26 rad/m2 . In addition to the different
RM values between the bands, the different beam sizes influence
the scale of the local variations of these values. In the disk, the
sign of RM values are comparable in both frequency bands.
3.7. Thermal/nonthermal separation

3.6.2. Large-scale magnetic field in C-band – comparison
between L-band and the archival VLA map

In Figure 15 the large-scale polarization from the CHANG-ES
C-band data is presented. The halo emission seen in this map is
consistent with the emission in the L-band image (Fig. A.2). Especially the polarized intensity to the southeast of the galaxy is
recovered (RA 12h 45m 10s DEC -0◦ 29’ 10"). The origin of this
polarization structure could be the shell-like feature marked in
the total intensity image with a higher resolution (Fig. 3). Also,
the extended polarized emission region in the northwestern halo
of the galaxy is similar to the L-band image (Fig. 14), whereas
the polarized emission region in the southeastern halo in Figure 15 is only recovered as a small feature in the L-band image.
To compare the CHANG-ES C-band data with the archival
VLA C-band data, the CHANG-ES data were imaged with robust zero weighting. Due to the fact that the archival VLA data
have nearly 380 minutes observing in C-band D-configuration
compared to only 40 minutes of CHANG-ES C-band data, but 3
hours of C-configuration observations, a comparison is only possible by higher weighting the CHANG-ES data D-configuration
using uv tapering. In general, the Stokes I background images,
the polarized intensity, and the magnetic field vectors are comparable between the old VLA (Fig. 16, original published in
Soida 2005) and the new CHANG-ES image (Fig. 15). Looking closer at the maps of NGC 4666 from C-band it is visible
that in the CHANG-ES map there is less extended polarized flux,
especially in the south (receding side) of the galaxy. In C-band
this is probably not due to depolarization effects. Bandwidth depolarization can be ruled out because the polarization map produced with RM synthesis also shows only polarized emission
in this region below 3σ. If we compare both maps (Fig. 16 and
Fig. 15) more carefully, we have to consider the different central
frequencies of 4.86 GHz and 6 GHz for the archival VLA and

Following Vargas et al. (2018), we performed a thermal/nonthermal separation to get the nonthermal maps of Cband and L-band.
We used the Hα emission derived from the Hα map, which
was provided by Dahlem et al. (1997). The Hα flux density was
corrected from 38% [NII] contamination.
Then the [NII]-corrected Hα flux density (LHα,obs ) was absorption corrected via infrared WISE data at 22 µm (νLν (22µm))
with the calibration factor of 0.042 from Vargas et al. (2018):
LHα,corr [erg s−1 ] = LHα,obs [erg s−1 ]+0.042·νLν (22µm)[erg s−1 ].

Following Vargas et al. (2018), the thermal emission was derived

An electron temperature of Te = 10,000 K is assumed, with
ν being the central frequency of 6 GHz and 1.5 GHz for Cband and L-band, respectively. The resulting thermal map was
then subtracted from the radio map to derive the nonthermal
map. To apply the thermal/nonthermal separation, all maps were
smoothed to the same beam of 13.3" × 13.3". We refer to Vargas
et al. (2018) for a detailed analysis on the thermal/nonthermal
separation in edge-on spiral galaxies.

start at a 3σ level with a σ of 9.3 µJy/beam and increase in powers of 2 (up to 64) with an additional contour at 3.5 mJy/beam to
mark the central source. The RM map is cut below the 3σ level of
25µJy/beam of the polarized intensity map from RM synthesis.
The mean error is 22 rad/m2 .
3.8. Nonthermal fractions

The maps of nonthermal fraction are shown in Figure 17 for Cband and Figure 18 for L-band. The mean nonthermal fractions
in the disk, the eastern halo, and the western halo are presented
in Table 17. In the disk these are 83.0 % in C-band and 93.8 %
in L-band. The nonthermal fractions in the halo are higher below the disk in comparison to the nonthermal fraction above the
disk. In C-band, these are 88.0 % in the southeastern halo and
81.0 % in the northwestern halo; in L-band these are 97.7 % in
the southeastern halo and 96.7 % in the northwestern halo. The
halo below the disk is closer to the observer. The interaction with
NGC 4668 could effect the distributions of CRs as well as of
magnetic fields. As seen before in the C-band radio image (Fig-

The nonthermal spectral index (αnt ) map was calculated from the
nonthermal maps of the two bands at the observed frequencies of
1.5 GHz and 6 GHz of the CHANG-ES data, giving the spatial
distribution of the spectral index in this galaxy. The nonthermal
SPI map was derived using the following equation:
αnt =

logInth (ν1 ) − logInth (ν2 )
,
logν1 − logν2

where ν1 and ν2 are the central frequencies of C-band and Lband, respectively. From Equation 8, the error ∆αnt with respect
to ∆I1 and ∆I2 can be determined using error propagation:

Both resulting maps are displayed in Figure 20. The error map displays uncertainties of below 0.05 in the disk,
which increase to 0.3 towards the edges. Based on the error map, the spectral index is cut off in order to only include
trustable values. A mean nonthermal spectral index in the disk
of αnt = −0.90 ± 0.05 is found, which is in good agreement
with synchrotron radiation being the dominant radiation process.
The spectral index steepens towards the edges and reaches values of αnt = −1.8 ± 0.3. The huge star formation region in the
south of the galaxy is clearly visible with a flatter spectral index
of αnt = −0.6 ± 0.05, which suggests synchrotron emission
from young CRs.

3.10. Magnetic field

The magnetic field structure is obtained via RM synthesis to gain
the intrinsic magnetic field vectors for the field component perpendicular to the line of sights as well as for the parallel line of
sight component. The magnetic field strength is determined with
the assumption of energy equipartition with the CR electrons.
3.10.1. Magnetic field configuration of the disk field

The analysis of disk magnetic fields of spiral galaxies makes it
possible to reveal the mode and direction of large-scale fields.
In face-on spiral galaxies the analysis is done via a sector integration using an RM map, where the RM values are plotted
against the azimuth angle in degrees in the plane of the galaxy
(Krause 1990). Hereby, the mode of the disk field is quantified,
that is, whether the field is axisymmetric (m=0), bisymmetric
(m=1) or can be described by higher modes. However, this is
not applicable to edge-on galaxies as the emission from the disk
is observed in projection. Additionally, to distinguish between an
even disk magnetic field parity (S, same direction above and below the mid plane) with a corresponding quadrupolar halo field
and an odd disk magnetic field parity (A, opposite orientation
above and below the mid plane) with a corresponding dipolar
halo field, RM data at high resolution and sensitivity, and especially with a wider range in λ2 -space, have to be obtained. Here,
we present a modified analysis method for RM maps of edge-on
galaxies for the disk magnetic field and apply it to NGC 4666.
Article number, page 14 of 23

In this new approach a rectangle along the disk is used to
obtain a profile of RM values along the major axis. Figure 21
shows the expected RM behavior in projection for this analysis
of an edge-on galaxy, where in the first two rows, the edge-on
view of an axisymmetric disk field (left) leads to positive RM
values on one side of the disk and to negative RM values on the
other side. The edge-on view of a bisymmetric disk field (right)
leads to negative RM values on both sides for the plotted field
configuration. Both RM behaviors would be mirrored across the
x-axis (major axis) if the magnetic field vectors were to point in
the opposite direction. In the third and fourth rows of Fig. 21, the
same is shown for a disk magnetic field with one radial reversal
at half of the disk radius.
Here we assume an even disk magnetic field parity with a
quadrupolar halo field, which seems to be the most readily excited dynamo mode in dynamo models (e.g., Ruzmaikin et al.
1988), especially considering a wind (e.g., Moss et al. 2010).
Additionally, the even disk parity is found in the Milky Way (Sun
et al. 2008) and in the external galaxies NGC 253 (Heesen et al.
2009), NGC 891 (Krause 2009), and NGC 5775 (Soida et al.
2011).
The analysis described above was carried out on the C-band
RM map. Figure 22 shows the rectangle along the major axis
with a box size of 7" × 14" (0.93 kpc × 1.87 kpc) on the RM
map to the left. For this analysis RM synthesis was applied in a
different way. The mean Q and U values within each box were
determined from the Q and U maps of each spw. For each of
these boxes there is one mean value from the Q map and one
mean value from the U map. Then a cube was made and RM
synthesis applied. The distance to the center against the resulting
RM value of each box is plotted separately for the approaching
side (left half of the galaxy, red) and the receding side (right half
of the galaxy, blue). The RM error was calculated with RMSF/(2
PI/σ) (Schnitzeler & Lee 2017), where RMSF is the resolution
in Faraday space, PI is the polarized flux density, and σ the noise
measured when integrating over the entire frequency band. This
is a good error approximation for PI/σ > 5 (Schnitzeler & Lee
2017). With the RMSF in C-band of ∼ 1800 rad m−2 from Table 5
and a 20σ signal, a mean RM error of 50 rad m−2 is derived.
The result is displayed on the right side of Figure 22 and
on the left side of Figure 23. The RM pattern on both sides is
approximately axisymmetric with respect to the x-axis, where a
maximum of the approaching curve corresponds to a minimum
of the receding curve and vice versa. The resulting curve of Figure 23 can be divided into two parts. The first part is up to ± 30"
(blue shaded) and the second part is from ± 30" to the end (yellow shaded). In the first part we see that the approaching side
shows mainly positive RM values and the receding side shows
mainly negative RM values. This behavior is comparable to the
expected RM behavior in the fourth row on the left-hand side of
Figure 21 for the axisymmetric case (m=0) with magnetic field
vectors pointing inwards in the inner part and pointing outwards
in the outer part. At the radius of about 30" (4 kpc) of Figure 23,
the behavior of the RM values of the two halves of the galaxy
of the blue shaded part of the plot change to the opposite. From
a radial distance of 30" further out (in the yellow shaded part
of the plot), the approaching side shows mainly negative values whereas the receding side shows mainly positive RM values.
This indicates an axisymmetric field pointing outwards.
We further tried to fit a sinusoid ( f (x) = (a0 sin(a1 x + a2 )) +
a3 ) to the data of both sides separately, which is shown with the
dashed and dotted lines in Figure 22. The receding side is fitted twice; Fit 1 excludes the data point at the radius of 38.5",
while Fit 2 includes all data points. In Table 18 we present the

Stein et al.: CHANG-ES XIII: Transport Processes and the magnetic fields of NGC 4666

(a0 sin(a1 x + a2 )) + a3 for Figure 22. Receding side 1 is the
fit to the receding side without the data point at the radius of
38.5", Receding side 2 is the fit to the receding side including all
data points.

fit parameters. The period P of the sinus along r is given by
P = 2π/a1 which results in P = 84" ± 7" for the approaching
side and P = 71" ± 7" for the receding side (fit 1). These two
values are slightly different.
The parameter a2 is the phase (in rad). The a2 values of the
two sides are the same within the errors and show that the sinusoidal functions have similar phases. A phase of π would correspond to an ASS field with vanishing pitch angle. The average
a2 value of ' 3.45 indicates a pitch angle of about 20◦ , which
is reasonable for spiral galaxies. Hence, the RM variations due
to the disk magnetic field of both sides are consistent with each
other and originate from the large-scale disk magnetic field.
A simplified model is shown in Figure 23, where one radial field reversal is assumed. The color code is equivalent to
the modeled disk field of Moss et al. (2012). The inner magnetic field points inwards and then outwards. The orientation
of the magnetic field vector can be determined using the simplified model of Figure 21. In the case of trailing spiral arms,
which is suggested for NGC 4666, and positive RM values on
the approaching side, the magnetic field vectors point inwards.
Positive RM values on the receding side correspond to magnetic
field vectors that point outwards (see Krause & Beck 1998).
In conclusion, an axisymmetric magnetic field is discovered
in NGC 4666. One field reversal along the radius of the orientation of the magnetic field is indicated by the C-band data at a
radial distance from the center of the galaxy of about 4 kpc. This
radius coincides with the optical end of the bar of NGC 4666.
The L-band data (see Fig. A.4) may suggest a second reversal at
about 90" (12 kpc) radius, but these data suffer from depolarization effects and may not be reliable. The presented disk model
is very simple and should be improved with better data, maybe
on other galaxies. The quality of the present data is not sufficient to analyze the halo parity, higher magnetic field modes,
and pitch angles. A significant deviation in phase shift between
the two sides of the galaxy would indicate that the assumption of
a constant pitch angle between the two sides of the galaxy and/or
between the inner and outer parts may not be fulfilled.
3.10.2. Magnetic field strength via equipartition

The maps of the magnetic field strength were determined with
the revised equipartition formula by Beck & Krause (2005).
The calculations were done pixel-by-pixel by taking the nonthermal intensity map and the resolved nonthermal spectral index map into account. The pixel values of the magnetic field
strength Beq were calculated according to the revised equipartition formula by Beck & Krause (2005). We assumed a spheroid
path length model varying between l = 19 kpc in the center and

bisymmetric disk magnetic field (right) with trailing spiral arms,
which are shaded red for the approaching side and blue for the
receding side. The black arrows show the direction of the magnetic field vectors. The direction of the rotation of the disk is
given by the bold black arrow below the four disks.
a) The upper part shows the face-on view of the two different
disk fields. In the case of an axisymmetric disk field (left) all
vectors are pointing inwards or outwards; here just one configuration is shown. In case of the bisymmetric magnetic field (right)
the vectors from one side of the galaxy are pointing inwards
and on the other side of the galaxy outwards (or the other way
around). In the second row, the expected RM behavior is plotted along the major axis of each galaxy model for an observer
watching the system edge-on. The red curve represents the RM
values from the approaching side, the blue curve from the receding side.
b) The upper part shows again the face-on view of the two different disk fields as above (left: axisymmetric disk field, right:
bisymmetric magnetic field). In a simplified approach, a radial
reversal is assumed at half of the disk radius. The last row shows
the expected and simplified RM value variation in case of a radial field reversal at half the radius of the disk.

data from the local Milky Way.
The resulting map is presented in Figure 24. The total magnetic field strength in the center reaches 15 µG. The field strength
decreases towards the halo to 8.5 µG. The mean disk magnetic
field strength is 12.3 µG, which is in agreement with the values found for 13 CHANG-ES galaxies by Krause et al. (2018).
The mean halo magnetic field strength is 10.1 µG in the eastern
halo and 9.6 µG in the western halo. The smallest magnetic field
strength of 7 µG is seen in the south of the galaxy. It appears
that the magnetic field strength is smoothly distributed over the
whole galaxy.

Dahlem et al. (1997) found a total field strength of 14.4 µG
in the disk and 7.1 µG in the halo, using C-band data and a fixed
spectral index of α  −0.79 in the disk and α  −0.9 in the
halo. The mean value of the disk and the halo total field strength
derived here are somewhat higher in comparison to those in
Dahlem et al. (1997). The reason is the difference of the application of the equipartition formula. The use of a fixed spectral
index leads to a faster decline of the magnetic field strength towards the halo.

3.11. One-dimensional cosmic ray transport model

The transport processes of CRs into the halo (perpendicular
to the galaxy disk) are derived by using a 1D CR transport
model with SPINNAKER (SPectral INdex Numerical Analysis
of K(c)osmic-ray Electron Radio-emission; Heesen et al. 2016,
2018) with a fixed inner boundary condition of N(E, 0) =
N0 E −γ0 and a corresponding nonthermal spectral index αnt =
(1 − γ0 )/2. Either pure advection is modeled, with an advection speed V assumed to be constant, or pure diffusion with a
µ
diffusion coefficient of D = D0 EGeV
, assumed to be along the
magnetic field lines. Here, the cosmic ray electron (CRe) energy is EGeV in units of GeV and µ is between 0.3 and 0.6, as
measured in the Milky Way (Strong et al. 2007). The combined
synchrotron and inverse compton radiation energy loss rate for a
single CRe is taken into account with one loss term.
This model is used on the total intensity profile of the pure
synchrotron maps, which represent the synchrotron intensity
emitted by the CRe as well as on the corresponding spectral index map of NGC 4666.
An interactive PYTHON wrapper around SPINNAKER
(SPINTERACTIVE; Miskolczi 2018, private communication) was
used to fit the data.9 We varied the input parameters manually,
while checking the quality of the fit on a graphical user interface,
and thus arrived at the best-fitting solution. The main input parameter is the transport process, choosing between diffusion and
advection. Depending on this choice, either the diffusion coefficient or the advection speed can be changed. Further parameters
to be fitted are the CRe injection spectral index, γ0 , the magnetic field strengths in total and of the thin disk component (B0 ,
B1 ), and magnetic field scale heights hb1 and hb2, for the thin
and thick disk, respectively. SPINNAKER models the magnetic
field distribution as the superposition of two exponential functions. Generally speaking, synchrotron intensity profiles can be
best described by a Gaussian function for diffusion and by an
exponential function for advection.
The intensity distribution of NGC 4666 is produced via BoxModels (Müller et al. 2017) using one stripe covering the width

are

available

The advection speed of 310 km s−1 can be compared with the
results from the sample of galaxies modeled with SPINNAKER
by Heesen et al. (2018), which included NGC 4666. They found
higher advection speeds between 500 and 700 km s−1 , but this
can be explained by their higher equipartition magnetic field
strength of B0 = 18.2 µG as a model input; that strength was derived using a simple thin disk model with a short path length of
1 kpc, whereas we now employ a more sophisticated model (Section 3.10.2). If we scale their advection speeds to the magnetic
field strength used here of B0 = 13.1 µG, assuming the CRe loss
time-scale is ∝ B−3/2
(Equation (5) in Heesen et al. 2016), their
0
advection speeds are now between 260 and 550 km s−1 , including the uncertainties, in fair agreement with our results. Our new
data, however, allow us to measure the advection speed much
more precisely.
The magnetic field strength of 13.1 µG for the thin component of the magnetic field is in very good agreement with the
mean disk value from equipartition of 12.3 µG. The nonthermal
spectral index found with SPINTERACTIVE follows from γ0 =
2.6. This results in αnt = −0.8. This value is in good agreement
with the mean value of the spectral index map (Fig. 20).
A diffusion model was tested for comparison; results of
which are shown in Appendix A. Figure A.5 shows that the bestfitting diffusion model performs worse than the advection model.
The total χ2di f = 5.6 is much higher than for advection, which
mainly originates from the spectral index profile fit. Advection
leads to a linearly steepening spectral index profile, whereas diffusion leads to a parabolic one. Our new results confirm that advection is the main transport process of CRs in NGC 4666. This
distinction is based purely on the goodness of the fit, whereas
for the old VLA data used by Heesen et al. (2018) this was not
possible. In summary, advection appears to be the main transport
process of CRs in NGC 4666.
3.12. Magnetic field strength comparison

In Figure 26, the magnetic field strength distribution of
NGC 4666 determined by using the equipartition assumption are
shown and compared to the magnetic field profile from SPINNAKER. The magnetic field strength profile in the vertical direction determined with the equipartition formula using the resolved spectral index map from Figure 24 is presented by dark
blue data points with a box size of 6" × 180". The black line
with shaded gray errors represents the magnetic field model from
SPINNAKER. The magnetic field is modeled as a two-component
exponential function:
B(z) = B1 exp(−|z|/hb1) + (B0 − B1 ) exp(−|z|/hb2) ,

Both distributions show similar values of the magnetic field
in the midplane of the galaxy, but large discrepancies in the halo.
In the halo, the SPINNAKER magnetic field strength is about 2.5
times less than the equipartition value in the halo at 5 kpc from
the center. To achieve the observed synchrotron flux density, the
number density of CRe (which is proportional to the CR energy
density) needs to be larger by a factor of 2.51−αnt ≈ 5 compared
to the equipartition value. Together, the ratio of energy densities
of cosmic rays and magnetic fields is 2.53−αnt ≈ 35, which is a
huge deviation from equipartition.
This deviation is a consequence of the cosmic ray advection
equation used in SPINNAKER. For a constant advection velocity, the cosmic ray energy density is constant, neglecting radiation and adiabatic losses of the electrons. Hence, the decrease of
the nonthermal radio continuum intensity is fully ascribed to a
decrease of the magnetic field strength. The SPINNAKER magnetic field strength is therefore a lower bound for the actual field
strength in the halo.
If we were allowing for an accelerating wind, the magnetic
field strength would be closer to the equipartition value. However, our advection model with a constant speed already gives a
relatively good fit to the data, and therefore seems to be sufficient. In the near future, we hope to probe radio haloes to even
larger distances from the star-forming disk using low-frequency
radio continuum observations that reveal the oldest CRe. For instance, the 144 MHz LOFAR study of Miskolczi et al. (2018) of

Stein et al.: CHANG-ES XIII: Transport Processes and the magnetic fields of NGC 4666

the edge-on galaxy NGC 3556 detected the radio halo to heights
of 15 kpc. These authors could show that an accelerated wind
model fits better than one with a constant wind speed.

4. Summary and Conclusions
The superwind and starburst galaxy NGC 4666 exhibits a boxy
radio halo in radio total intensity. Its extent is up to 9 kpc from
the midplane into the halo in L-band, which is probably produced by a supernova-driven wind across almost the entire disk.
The supplemental X-ray data show large-scale hot gas surrounding the galaxy, which is also box-shaped and reaches the same
height as the L-band radio data. As in other CHANG-ES galaxies, such as for example NGC 4631 (Irwin et al. 2012b), we find
the magnetic field and X-ray morphologies to be similar, which
indicates an important influence of the magnetic field on the hot
gas dynamics.
For the first time a central point source of NGC 4666 was
detected at radio wavelengths and further observed in our Xray data with clear AGN fingerprints, which supports previous
findings from X-ray observations that NGC 4666 harbors an
AGN. A corresponding bubble-like structure was found below
the midplane in the radio data, which was previously suggested
by Dahlem et al. (1997), who found indications for a bipolar
outflow with an associated galactic superwind within the central
6.5 kpc. In our X-ray data the extension of the bubble-structure
is seen, which reaches far into the halo.
NGC 4666 appears different above and below the disk. First,
this is visible in the total intensity image of the combined Cband observations (Figure 3). NGC 4666 shows extraordinary
filamentary structures above the disk reaching into the halo like
fingers. These radio filaments are comparable to Hα filamentary structures. In contrast to this, shell-like structures are visible below the disk. Secondly, the X-ray analysis revealed higher
thermal energy densities in the western part (above the disk).
Thirdly, the nonthermal fraction maps in C-band and L-band
show an asymmetric fraction of the two halo sides, where the
western halo (above the disk) is characterized by higher thermal
fractions. The most likely explanation is the interaction of the
galaxy with NGC 4668, which is also discussed to be the reason
for the starburst happening in NGC 4666 (Walter et al. 2004).
The interacting galaxy NGC 4668 is located to the southeast of
NGC 4666.
A scale-height analysis was applied to radio data smoothed
to a beam of 13.3" × 13.3" in both bands. An asymmetry is found
in the halo above and below the disk as well as between the two
sides of the major axis. The mean scale height of the thick disk
in C-band is 1.57 ± 0.21 kpc and the mean scale height of the
thick disk in L-band is 2.16 ± 0.36 kpc.
The results of RM synthesis show that NGC 4666 is characterized by an X-shaped large-scale magnetic field structure with
an observed magnetic field reaching far into the halo. In C-band,
the polarized intensity and magnetic field orientation were determined by imaging Stokes Q and U with a robust two weighting.
In comparison to RM synthesis with robust two weighting, the
polarization map from Stokes Q and Stokes U and robust two
weighting shows 1.2 times more polarized flux density. In the
uv-tapered and smoothed images from archival VLA and from
CHANG-ES data the large-scale X-shaped magnetic field in Cband is visible. In L-band, RM synthesis is useful and necessary
to detect polarized intensity from the entire galaxy with a factor of 1.4 of enhanced polarized flux density in comparison to
imaging Stokes Q and U (both with robust two weighting).

Large radio halos and large-scale magnetic fields are observed in many CHANG-ES galaxies (Wiegert et al. 2015) and
in other edge-on galaxies (Krause 2009; Beck 2016). These findings suggest a general mechanism in spiral galaxies that produces and maintains the large-scale fields. A universal explanation is the mean-field dynamo theory, where a regular field
is induced from seed fields. These were probably amplified beforehand by the small-scale dynamo, which amplifies turbulent
magnetic fields.
Generally, the CHANG-ES galaxies tend to show less or no
polarization on the receding side of the galaxy. Furthermore, the
peak of polarized flux density is shifted towards the approaching side of the galaxy. In NGC 4666, polarized emission in Lband was recovered with RM synthesis also in the south side of
the galaxy, which is the receding side. In C-band, RM synthesis
was not able to recover the polarized emission in the south. By
weighting and smoothing the C-band data, low-level polarized
intensity was recovered also in the south. Differences in the Cband observations of NGC 4666 could originate from the short
observing time and uv distribution leading to parts of the large
scale faint polarized emission being missed. This could be the
reason why less polarized intensity is detected on the receding
side in C-band. Nevertheless it does not explain why the peak
of polarized intensity is shifted towards the approaching side,
which seems to be an intrinsic feature of the emission.
The CR transport was modeled with the 1D SPINNAKER
model and found to be advection dominated with an advection
speed of 310 km s−1 . This velocity is slightly higher than the escape velocity
√ of this galaxy estimated by Heesen et al. (2018) to
be vesc = 2 vrot ≈ 280 km s−1 , neglecting the contribution of
a dark-matter halo. We therefore conclude that NGC 4666 has
a galactic wind, as was already indicated by the box-shaped appearance of the radio halo. We assumed a constant wind speed
for simplicity, but relaxing this to an accelerating wind, the escape velocity should be easily surpassed in the halo even if there
is an extended dark-matter halo.
The magnetic field strength map was then calculated using
the equipartition formula from Beck & Krause (2005) with the
C-band synchrotron map, the resolved spectral index map, and
the spheroid path length model. The mean strength of the disk
magnetic field is 12.3 µG, which is in good agreement with the
field strengths of other spiral galaxies (Beck 2016). Nevertheless, there are a few drawbacks of field strength determinations
via equipartition. The result of the equation leads to an overestimate if the magnetic field varies along the line of sight or
within the telescope beam, whereas an underestimate of the field
strength happens in regions where energy losses of the CR electrons are important, for example in starburst regions or halos
(Beck 2016).
The magnetic field strength profile determined from equipartition was compared to the SPINNAKER model of the magnetic
field and found to be similar in the midplane (which is a consequence of setting the B0 parameter to be similar to the equipartition field strength) and very different towards the halo with a
factor of 2.5 in the magnetic field strength. In the halo, the SPINNAKER magnetic field strength is a lower limit for the actual
field strength.
Analyses of the RM maps of NGC 4666 derived from RM
synthesis reveals that the structure of the disk field is likely axisymmetric with indications of one magnetic field reversal at a
radius of about 30" (4 kpc). The data suggest that the field orientation points inwards and then outwards with increasing radial
distance from the center. The large-scale field reversals between
the central region and the disk that have been observed in M31

(Gießübel & Beck 2014) and IC342 (Beck 2015), as well as the
reversal along the azimuth in NGC 4414 (Soida et al. 2002), are
not comparable with the findings in this paper. This is the first
time an indication of a radial field reversal within the disk of an
external galaxy has been found.
In our Milky Way, there is one large-scale magnetic reversal
close to the solar radius at about 7 kpc distance from the Galactic
center, while the existence and location(s) of more reversals is
still under debate (Haverkorn 2015).
The occurrence of radial field reversals is of fundamental
importance for the theory of magnetic fields. In mean-field dynamo theory, there are different radial eigenmodes of the meanfield induction equation. Higher-order modes with many radial
reversals may have a higher amplitude to begin with, but eventually the lowest order mode without reversals will win out because it grows fastest (Poezd et al. 1993). Radial field reversals
may also move outward in the nonlinear dynamo stage, which
is governed, at least partly, by the slow process of radial diffusion (Chamandy et al. 2013). Radial reversals may still persist
in present-day galaxies hosting a dynamo in their evolutionary
phase.
Moss et al. (2012) were able to predict radial field reversals
in the disk of a spiral galaxy using a numerical mean-field dynamo model with continuous injection of turbulent fields to represent the effect of supernova explosions in discrete star forming
regions with ongoing small-scale dynamo action. In their paper,
a face-on view of a spiral galaxy is shown with multiple field
reversals, which is used as an example for the construction of
the simplified disk model of NGC 4666 (Figure 23). Our finding
of an indication of a reversal in NGC 4666 is in agreement with
dynamo theory and supports the α − ω dynamo theory acting
in spiral galaxies. Furthermore, it reveals that the Milky Way is
probably not an exception in showing a radial field reversal.
