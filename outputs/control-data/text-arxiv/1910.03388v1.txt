Abstract
Paper [1] derived the probability density function (PDF) of a sum of products of two
correlated complex Gaussian zero-mean random variables (RVs) that has been applied to
calculate the error probabilities of a M -ary phase shift keying (M -PSK) system. We show
that there exist some typos in the computation and we provide the detailed derivation
leading to the correct expressions.

Keywords: Probability density function, correlated complex Gaussian RVs.

Introduction

The paper [1] has received a large interest for many years as it is an important milestone in
the analytical derivation of error probabilities in the communication system based on M -ary
phase shift keying (M -PSK) modulations. However, there exist some typos in the equations [1,
eq. (11)] and [1, eq. (12)] deriving the probability density function (PDF) of the dot-product
between the complex-valued vectors of signal and of channel, referred to as the random variable
(RV) Z. These typos will be corrected in this letter. Observing closely the goals of the paper [1],
we note two major points:
• The correctness of the PDF of Z is important, as it affects directly the correctness of
subsequent derived PDF of the phase (or amplitude) of Z that is required for the error
probability calculation. Unfortunately, the detailed derivation was omitted in [1] and only
the final formula is given.
• The PDF should be a function of the variances of signal RV and channel RV as well as
of the correlation between these two RVs. However, when the correlation is set to 0 (i.e.,
no correlation), it appears that the joint PDFs [1, eqs. (11), (12)] are independent of the
variances, which suggest us that the expressions are erroneous.
Therefore, the aims of this letter are three-fold:
• The computation of the PDF of Z.

• The exact derivation of PDF of the amplitude and of the phase of Z. In addition to the
solution proposed in [1], a new alternative approximation of the PDF of the phase of Z
is derived, which contains elementary trigonometric functions that are interesting for the
further error probability calculation of M -PSK systems.
• The numerical verification of the correctness of derived PDFs.

Corrected derivation of [1, (11), (12)]

that (Xl , Yl ) are complex-valued,

E |Xl |2 · E |Yl |2 = |µ| · ejε ; and such that (Xl , Yl ) are statistically independent
and identically
distributed with any other pairs (Xk , Yk ) for ∀l 6= k, we need to derive the PDF
PL
of Z = l=1 Xl · Yl .
In order to derive the PDF of Z, we follow the steps suggested in [1] as follows:
• Step 1: Derive the joint characteristic function (CF) of ZR and ZI .
• Step 2: Perform the inverse CF transformation to yield the joint PDF of ZR and ZI .
• Step 3: Perform
the Cartesian-polar transformation to yield the joint PDF of the ampliq
2
tude R = ZR + ZI2 and the phase Θ = arctan (ZI /ZR ).
• Step 4: Integrate the joint PDF either over the RV Θ to yield the PDF of R or over the
RV R to obtain the PDF of Θ.

2.1

Step 1

We first consider the case L = 1 and omit the subscripts l of RVs Xl and Yl for simplicity. Once
we find the CF of Z, the generalization with any value of L is straightforward thanks to the
properties of the CF. Let us express Y as the contribution of X plus a RV U ∼ CN 0, σU2
independent of X as follows:

where the variance σU2 R = σU2 I = 2U = 2Y 1 − |µ|2 . It is easy to check that the correlation
between X and Y is µ. From aforementioned assumptions and the distributions of X and Y , it
is straightforward to obtain the distribution of ZR and ZI conditioned on X as follows:

By solving the trivial problem (6), the CF corresponding to L = 1 is obtained. The CF is
generalized to any value of L as presented in (7), in which we apply the property that the CF
of the summation of independent RVs is equal to the multiplication of all individual CFs w.r.t
each RV. It can be observed that we obtain again the CF derivation as in [1].

formula the joint PDF is still a function of the variances of RVs X and Y .

We obtain the polar coordinate form of the joint PDF of ZR and ZI by changing the variables
in (13) as zR = r cos θ and zI = r sin θ. Taking into account the Jacobian matrix determinant
of r, we achieve the joint PDF of the amplitude R and the phase Θ (14). Again we can observe
additional terms related to the variances of X and Y compared to the one derived in [1, eq. (12)].

Step 4A

The derivation of the PDF of R is straightforward by integrating the joint PDF over the RV Θ.
Applying again [3, eq. (3.338-4)], we achieve the PDF of R (15). Note that, this PDF can be
readily applied to the performance evaluation of the time-reversal communication system, i.e.,
[5] by setting the correlation equal to zero. For comparison, we derive the subsequent erroneous
PDF of R (16), fR (r), based on [1, eq. (12)]:

(16)

Step 4B

By integrating the joint PDF over the RV R, we can achieve the PDF of the phase Θ. However,
the solution is often expressed in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric series, which makes
it difficult to further calculate the error probability of the M -PSK system. The author in [1]
proposed an innovative way to evaluate the integral and the result is expressed in terms of the Lth partial derivatives of the trigonometric and inversed trigonometric functions. Unfortunately,
the detailed derivation is again omitted. We first re-derive the exact solution [1, eq. (13)]. Then,
we propose an alternative approximation of the mentioned integral, in which the modified Bessel
function is represented by a series of elementary functions. The approximated result turns out
to compose of only trigonometric functions, which can be useful to further manipulations.
• First method: exact solution
Changing the variable, i.e., t =

and integrating the joint PDF fR,Θ (r, θ) over

the RV R yields the following PDF of the phase Θ:

Surprisingly, (17) is equal to the result obtained by integrating the joint PDF [1, eq. (12)]
over the variable r. Therefore, the subsequent results in [1] can be correct. But it is not the
case for the PDF (15) of the amplitude R if used.
In order to further compute fΘ (θ), we first apply the integral representation of KL−1 (t) [6,
eq. (10.32.10)] so that (17) can be rewritten as:

kind in (17) L − 1 is an integer number bigger than 1, the series representation of KL−1 (t)
converges [5].
Although the derivation is algebraically complicated, it is straightforward to obtain the
tractable closed-form approximation of the PDF of Θ (27). It can be observed that the formula of
fΘ (θ) is convenient to derive the error probability of phase-modulated signals, as the calculation

of the error probability is equivalent to compute the integrals of the form θ12 (a+bdθ
, whose

results exist in the literature, i.e., [3, eqs. (2.554)], or it can be easily numerically evaluated.
The particular cases of error probability calculations are out of the scope of this letter.

Numerical Results

For the sake of simplicity, we set variances σX = 0.7, σY = 1.5 and the correlation µ = 0.5 ·
exp (jπ/6) in all simulations. The simulated histograms are plotted after 100 000 realizations.
We first numerically validate the derived joint PDF (13). Fig. 1 presents the normalized
two-dimensional histogram of the RV Z, when L = 5. The simulated histogram is illustrated
in Fig. 1(a). The analytic histograms applying (13) and [1, eq. (11)] are plotted in Fig. 1(b)
and Fig. 1(c), respectively. It can be observed that the histogram built based on our derivation
looks similar to the simulated histogram while the one built based on the derivation in [1] is
much wider.
Since the derivation of (14) was with a simple manipulation from (13), we directly validate
derived PDFs of the amplitude of Z (15) and of the phase of Z (24) and (27). To reduce the
complexity, the number of expansion terms in (27) is set to L, i.e., T = L. In what follows, we
consider three cases, in which (a) L = 1; (b) L = 5 and (c) L = 10.
Figure 2 presents the histograms of the amplitude of Z and their associated analytical PDFs
fR (r) (15) derived in this letter and fR (r) (16) derived based on result in [1]. It can be seen
that our proposed PDF fits better the actual PDF, confirming the correctness of our derivation.

Figure 3 plots the histograms of the phase of Z and their associated analytical PDFs fΘ (θ)
(24), (27). Both PDF envelopes match each other and fit well the simulated histograms. Although the results for L = 2 and L = 3 are omitted, it is worth noticing that our proposed
approximated PDF provides a good approximation whenever L ≥ 4, which frequently happens
in the large bandwidth and densely connected systems. Furthermore, our proposed solution of
the PDF of the phase of Z is better suited to the further manipulations and does not require
extra partial derivative operator. As the rest of [1] was based on the PDF of the phase of Z [1,
eq. (13)], which is correct, the results of this paper is still valid.
