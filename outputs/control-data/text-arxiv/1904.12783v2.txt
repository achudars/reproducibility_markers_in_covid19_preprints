INTRODUCTION

r*

Black holes are some of the most remarkable objects in nature. As endpoints of gravitational collapse they are where
our current theory of gravity, General Relativity, is pushed to
its extremes. While we have acknowledged their existence for
many decades, the recent detection of black hole mergers by
Advanced LIGO [1] and VIRGO [2], or the imaging of the
event horizon of the black hole at the heart of M87 [3], further
reinforce our belief in them as a part of the astronomical zoo.
Even though black holes are such exotic objects, they are
also surprisingly featureless. In the context of General Relativity, and under certain assumptions, we know that a black
hole is completely characterized by its mass M, spin J, and
electromagnetic charge Q [4, 5]. This means that two black
holes which have the same M, J and Q are completely indistinguishable. Furthermore, even for a broad class of extensions
of General Relativity (in particular, where the extensions have
a cosmological impact), black holes maintain this featureless
characteristic [6–9] and cannot support a non trivial configuration in surrounding fields. For this reason, it is often stated that
black holes have no hair. If we restrict ourselves to an electrically neutral, non spinning, spherically symmetric black hole,
the spacetime line element is then given by:

where t, r, θ and φ are Schwarzschild polar coordinates,
f (r) = 1 − Rrs with Rs = 2GM being the Schwarzschild radius given only in terms of the mass of the black hole M and
Newton’s constant G.
One might hope that, given their extreme nature, black
holes could be used as a novel arena in which to explore new
aspects of physics, but the expectation of having no hair works
against this; if the black hole cannot support a non trivial environment, there will not be new physics to test. Fortunately, the
expectation of featurelessness arises from a set of no-hair theorems which make a number of restrictive assumptions about

Through numerical simulations of a minimally coupled massive Klein-Gordon scalar field, we show that it
is possible to grow hair on a Schwarzschild black hole if one assumes an initial periodically time-varying but
spatially homogeneous scalar background. By “hair”, we mean a non-trivial profile in the scalar field. We find
that this profile emerges on a timescale related to the mass of the black hole, with features related to the mass
of the scalar particle. We undertake simulations with and without backreaction on the metric and see that the
essential, qualitative features remain consistent. We also contrast the results from higher mass scalars to the case
of a low mass with a large Compton wavelength. The results are particularly relevant for scalar-tensor theories
of gravity and dark matter models consisting of a massive scalar, e.g. axions.

FIG. 1. Two top figures show ϕ as a function of r∗ without backreaction. The first plot illustrates the growth in time of the amplitude
from a homogeneous state (with Tm = 2π/m). The second shows
that the profiles depend on mass in a similar way to the expected analytical profiles – i.e. there are more oscillations for higher masses,
and the envelope of the oscillations is well fit at larger radii by r−3/4 .
The bottom plot shows a timelapse of ϕ versus r over a period of
oscillation at a time of t˜/Tm ∼ 200 for the backreacting case, which
shows a consistent build up and profile.

the existence and environment of the black hole: that they are
stationary, embedded in an asymptotically flat spacetime and
that any new field, or “hair” is regular at the horizon. Such
conditions may be far from what a run-of-the-mill black hole
will experience: the universe is expanding and full of material, much of which is not well understood. We have learned
from LIGO that many black holes do not exist in isolation,
but may spiral into each other and merge in a highly dynamical and energetic process. In other words, black holes live in a

2
universe which is not stationary or asymptotically flat. Thus,
given our new found ability to probe black holes with gravitational waves or imaging, one needs to revisit the possibility
that they may have hair in this context.
We know that many black holes do have long lived “hair” in
the form of accretion discs of visible matter (although this is of
course not stationary), but from a theoretical perspective, the
possibility that a black hole may have scalar hair, ϕ(r,t) is of
particular interest. In this case, it will have a scalar field with
a non trivial profile surrounding it which may, in turn, modify
the spacetime metric (see [10] for a review). Scalar fields exist
in nature and arise as the low energy degree of freedom for
a number of candidate fundamental theories [11–13] where
they may be non-trivially (or non-minimally) coupled to the
metric. In that case, they can be interpreted as new, “fifth”
forces which can be constrained in a number of ways [14].
Scalar fields are also the basis for several popular dark matter
(DM) candidates, e.g. as an approximation to an axion-like
particle [15–18].
There are reasonably general proofs that, under the restrictive conditions described above, it is not possible to
have scalar hair for either minimal or non-minimal couplings.
However, a number of counterexamples have been proposed
for asymptotically flat spacetimes which lead to either long
lasting hair or wigs [19–23], by relaxing one or more of the
no hair assumptions. For example in the case of Herdeiro and
Radu’s hairy black holes [22] the complex scalar field around
a spinning black hole varies in time (although the stress energy tensor is constant) and the solution is characterised by a
Noether charge from the scalar sector, in addition to the usual
BH parameters. Another important case also occurs for rotating – i.e. Kerr – black holes, where a superradiant instability
can lead to a copious production of scalar particles by amplification of quantum fluctuations in a bosonic field (see [24]
for a review). The particles extract angular momentum from
the BH to populate bound states, leading to clouds which decay over much longer periods into gravitational radiation. In
this paper we will discuss another possibility: that the growth
of hair may result from the black hole being embedded in a
cosmological spacetime, containing an asymptotically timevarying but spatially homogeneous scalar field.
In a seminal paper [25], Jacobson showed that it was possible to endow a black hole with hair if it is embedded in a
cosmological spacetime dominated by a massless scalar field.
Specifically, he showed it was possible to construct a nontrivial solution for ϕ(t, r) which varied with time asymptotically, ϕ(t, r = ∞) ∝ t and which was regular at the horizon.
Jacobson’s solution is a proof of concept that it is possible
to endow a black hole with hair by mildly violating the conditions for the no-hair theorems. The amplitude of the hair
is proportional to ϕ̇ at r = ∞; if ϕ̇ ∼ H0 (Hubble rate today)
and monotonic, as one might expect in a cosmological setting, then the effect of hair will be negligible. The possibility
remains, however, that ϕ̇  H0 which would lead to a more
substantial effect, and it is this scenario which we investigate
here.
We will focus on the case of a single massive scalar field
minimally coupled to the metric. This field will satisfy the

Klein-Gordon equation on a curved spacetime. For concreteness, let us consider a scalar with a potential V (ϕ) = 21 m2 ϕ 2 ,
which could be the dominant term in the Taylor expansion of a
more general potential arising, for example, in general scalartensor theories considered in the Einstein frame [12, 13] or
could be a good approximation to a light bosonic particle with
mass m.
There is extensive work on the role massive scalar fields
can play in cosmology [18, 26]. If the field oscillates coherently, it behaves (on average) like a homogeneous source of
dark matter; inhomogeneous modes will cluster, with an emergent sound speed set by the Compton wavelength of the scalar
field, λC ∼ 1/m. Particularly in low mass cases, scalar particles may form halos which are partially stabilized by their
macroscopic quantum behaviour, leading to distinct signatures.
Here, we numerically show, for the first time, how an initially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological scalar field,
with ϕ(t) ∝ eimt , evolves in time and settles around a
spherically-symmetric BH, forming a scalar cloud (illustrated
in Fig. 1 with detailed discussion in Section III). Furthermore,
we do so self consistently, including the backreaction of the
scalar field on the metric.
In the limit of large m, what we are simulating describes
the infall and clustering of the scalar particles around the black
hole. We find that a non trivial profile grows on a timescale related to the mass of the black hole (its freefall timescale), with
features in the cloud related to the mass of the scalar particle.
Note that this mechanism is very different from the formation
of superradiant clouds – the energy of the cloud is fed by the
asymptotic oscillations of the field, not from the black hole
itself (which in this work is non spinning). Since the field at
the boundary is non zero, and homogeneously oscillating, it
provides an infinite reservoir of particles with which to feed
the black hole.
We structure the paper as follows. In Section II we describe the details of the system we are studying and the numerical implementation which is employed. In Section III we
present the results for a number of situations: without and with
the backreaction on the metric evolution and for infalling and
standing waves in the scalar field. In Section IV we discuss
our results and the physical interpretation of the new effect
that we have studied.
Note that our simulations use geometric units in which G =
c = 1, and thus the scalar field is parameterised by the inverse
length scale µ, expressed in terms of the Schwarzschild radius
Rs . In this paper we relate this length scale to the scalar mass
via µ = mc/h̄ and restore the G in some places so that the
units are consistent. Thus our simulations are parametrised in
terms of the dimensionless quantity GMm, which then sets the
mass of the black hole if the mass of the particle is specified,
and vice versa. As an example, for the case GMm = 1, this
could correspond to a solar mass BH and a scalar with mass
m ∼ 10−10 eV, or a supermassive BH of M = 1010 M with a
scalar mass m ∼ 10−20 eV.

FRAMEWORK AND NUMERICAL SETUP

To begin with, let us consider the case where Eq. (1) is
a background metric on which the dynamical scalar field
evolves (i.e. no backreaction). In this case, the Klein-Gordon
equation on a Schwarzschild background gives the following
evolution equation for a spherically-symmetric scalar ϕ(t, r)

One can look for stationary solutions of the form ϕ =
eiωt ψ(r). Ingoing boundary conditions are imposed at the
horizon, due to the causal structure of the black hole. However, we allow both ingoing and outgoing modes at spatial
infinity (which allows the temporal frequency ω to take real
values). This choice of boundary conditions mimics the effect
of sources external to the black hole which, in our case, describe the cosmological background in which the black hole
is embedded. This background acts as a reservoir, from which
particles fall into the black hole and create an ingoing flux
of waves that cause the formation of a cloud surrounding
the black hole. With this choice of boundary conditions, it
is possible to construct exact solutions for the entire spacetime [29–32], based on the Heun functions which describe
a scalar cloud surrounding the BH1 . For a thorough analysis of the scalar field cloud in this case, see [33]. There will
be two qualitatively different situations to distinguish: when
(i) Rs m < 1 and (ii) Rs m & 1. Generically, the solution to
the equations will allow for frequencies ω 2 = m2 + k2 , with
k denoting the spatial energy of the scalar field at infinity in
the Schwarzschild geometry. As we will discuss later, due
to the homogeneous initial profile chosen for the scalar, the
numerical solutions described in this paper will fit profiles
with ω = m. For this reason, from now on we limit ourselves
to this choice. On the one hand, in case (i), the Compton
wavelength of the scalar particle is outside the horizon and it
creates a potential barrier that will reflect ingoing waves near
the horizon. In this case, whereas the near-horizon solutions
(r∗ → −∞ or r → Rs ) are given by ϕ ∝ exp{−im(t + r∗ − r)}
for ω = m, far from the horizon
√ we have standing waves given
by ϕ ∝ exp{−imt} cos(2m Rs r)/r3/4 . On the other hand, in
case (ii), the Compton wavelength of the scalar particle is inside the horizon and the potential becomes purely attractive,
leading thus to ingoing waves only. The solutions near the
∗)
horizon are given by ϕ ∝ eiω(t+r
far from the hori√  whereas
zon by ϕ ∝ exp{−im t + 2 Rs r }/r3/4 for ω = m.

Note that these solutions are fundamentally different to the bound states
which are excited by superradiant growth.

We emphasize that these analytical solutions characterize
stationary scalar fields with an amplitude reaching a maximum around the black hole and decaying at infinity. However,
in this paper we focus instead on the dynamical growth of
hair from a completely homogeneous scalar field to the cloud
previously mentioned. In addition, we consider a somewhat
different setup, one of a cosmological background in which
the field has an asymptotically finite amplitude of oscillation,
at least over some region large relative to Rs . Nevertheless,
as we will discuss in the following sections, we find that the
scalar profile close to the BH shares the features of the stationary analytical solutions at any moment during the growth.

A.

Metric setup: without backreaction

For cases without backreaction, we employ the code and
methods of [34]. We fix the metric to Eq. (1), although for
practical reasons we use Cartesian Kerr-Schild coordinates
(see e.g. [35]), which are horizon penetrating. The KerrSchild time coordinate t˜ is related to the Schwarzschild coordinate t through t˜ = t + RS ln (r/RS − 1), and the radial coordinate is that of Schwarzschild (in presenting our results we
convert to the tortoise coordinate r∗ for clarity). In such coordinates the metric in the standard 3 + 1 ADM decomposition
is given by:
ds2 = −α 2 dt 2 + γi j (dxi + β i dt)(dx j + β j dt),

where xi = xi are the Cartesian coordinates on the grid and
r2 = x2 + y2 + z2 . The trace of the extrinsic curvature K, the
only other component required for the evolution of the fields,
is given by:
K = 2α 3 (1 + H)xi ∂i H + 2αH∂i (xi /r),

The metric necessitates excision at the singularity – in the
static Schwarzschild case this can be done by simply setting the field within the horizon (in practice we do this for
r < Rs /2) to decay to zero. Since the curvature of the metric
prevents signals from escaping, errors due to the excision do
not in principle propagate outwards.
In this fixed case, we set Rs = 1 and study the formation of
the cloud in four different cases: GMm = 0.1, GMm = 0.5,

4
GMm = 1, GMm = 2. The first case represents a “low mass”
case where the effect of the pressure from the Compton wavelength of the scalar is significant. In the remaining cases, this
effect is smaller with the field behaving more like a pressureless dust as GMm increases. We refer to these then as the
“high mass” cases.

B.

Metric setup: including backreaction

For cases with backreaction, the full numerical relativity capabilities of the publicly available numerical relativity
(NR) code GRC HOMBO [36, 37] (www.grchombo.org)
are used. The specific approach and code was adapted from
that used in [38], which employed standard Numerical Relativity (NR) techniques. The BSSN/CCZ4 formulation of
the Einstein equations is combined with the moving puncture
method for stable evolution of BH spacetimes, and the initial
data is conformally flat Bowen-York data [39] for an isolated
(non spinning, non boosted) BH. We are required to add a spatially constant
value for the trace of the extrinsic curvature,
√
K = − 24πρ0 , so that the Hamiltonian constraint
H = R + K 2 − Ki j K i j − 16πρ = 0

(9)

is properly satisfied in the presence of the non-zero field.
Here, ρ is the energy density of the scalar field with initial
value ρ0 . This results in a background with the spacetime
asymptotically expanding, as motivated by our cosmological
scenario. For these dynamical metric simulations we focus
only on the case with GMm = 1, since we expect the effects
to be consistent in the other cases.

C.

time integration and a hierarchy of grid resolutions. Note that
in the fixed background case the metric does not evolve dynamically, and the metric components are calculated analytically rather than stored on the grid. The size of the domain is
L = 1024RS , and we use seven (2:1) refinement levels with the
coarsest having 2563 grid points, although we use the octant
symmetry of the problem in Cartesian coordinates to reduce
the domain to 1283 points. The fact that we do not explicitly impose spherical symmetry means that in the future we
will be able to easily generalize these simulations to spinning
and binary black holes. However, it also breaks the spherical symmetry of the domain, which may explain the late time
instabilities in the evolution which are discussed below.
We implemented non-zero, time oscillating boundary conditions for the scalar field by extrapolating the field from
within the numerical domain. After testing several possibilities, we imposed that the field amplitude is extrapolated either linearly ϕ = B − Ar or as r−3/4 at the boundaries, with
the case chosen at each step which minimizes the change from
the values within the domain. During the build up of the cloud
the energy density at the boundaries decreases only fractionally and the field profile remains smooth as it oscillates. Note
that, unlike in the analytical solution, our boundaries do not
permit ingoing waves of frequency m, and are not initially
constrained to decay as r−3/4 . Despite these differences, we
see the growth of a cloud with a similar form to the analytical
solutions.
For all our setups we perform validation tests of the metric
used, check the Hamiltonian constraint violation is bounded
and decreases with resolution (for backreacting cases), and
test convergence of the field as illustrated in Fig. 2. The numerical errors over the periods for which the results are presented are not significant.

For all simulations the initial conditions for the scalar field

an initial amplitude ϕ0 such that the energy density is ρ(t =
0, r) = ρ0 = 10−10 R−2
s in geometric code units. In physical
units this is significantly higher than the average energy density of dark matter2 . In the case without backreaction, we are
only interested in the evolution of the field and the absolute
energy density of the field is not particularly relevant, but in
the case with backreaction we should bear in mind that the
expansion of spacetime and backreaction effects will be significantly higher than in a physically realistic scenario, so this
is an overly stringent test of robustness to backreaction effects.

RESULTS

Fixed background metric without backreaction

We begin with the results without backreaction, in which
the scalar field is evolved on a fixed Schwarzschild background. In Fig. 1 we see a steady growth of the scalar amplitude around the BH for GMm = 1, starting from a homogeneous profile; after an initial transient period, there is an approximately linear build up in the ingoing waves, which have
a spatial envelope well fit by a 1/r3/4 dependence, and a spatial wavelength which decreases with increasing m. Note that
further out the field asymptotes to a homogeneous profile (the
boundary is at r = 512Rs ), so an extrapolation of the 1/r3/4
fit at smaller r lies above the asymptotic values. Over time
the amplitude at the boundary is decreasing, but only very
slightly – as explained further below, it appears that the field
is gradually redistributing itself into the analytic profile which
matches the amplitude imposed at the boundary.
During the initial growth of the cloud, the temporal frequency of the oscillations depends on time and space, but after
only ∼ 20 oscillations it converges to a constant given by m.
We observe a similar behaviour for the spatial frequencies,
with a spatial dependence on m as shown in Fig. 3. Our results thus approximately fit the k = 0 analytical results, which
is consistent with our choice of initial conditions – set such
that the spatial momentum of the field is zero. Also, this is
consistent with the cold DM case, for which the momentum
is small relative to the mass (although one would expect a non
zero angular momentum). In the low mass regime, GMm  1,
as explained above, we expect standing waves rather than ingoing waves, and this is consistent with what we observe from
the frequencies for the case GMm = 0.1 in Fig. 3, and also
from the profiles shown in Fig. 4.
We show the time evolution in more detail in Fig. 5 for the
high mass cases, where the amplitude of the scalar field oscillations at several values of r∗ are plotted versus the number

analytical solutions in the case of k = 0.

of oscillations in the field. In these cases where GMm ∼ 1,
the rate of growth of the field amplitude as a function of the
number of oscillations, n, is faster than in the lower mass
cases, with a dependence
√ on m after the initial transient period of ϕ10 dϕ/dn ∝ 1/ m. Given that the oscillation period
Tm ∝ 1/m, the physical
√ rate of build up of the field profile will
scale as ϕ10 dϕ/dt ∝ m.

as expected since the energy density scales as ρ ∝ ϕ 2 . Thus
the energy density grows at a rate in real time which is independent of m, and we measure the physical time for the mass
within r < 100Rs to double as t = (M/M )6 ms. These values

cannot define r∗ as the gauge is dynamical, but we select the same
coordinate locations as the fixed case for the plot. Whilst these will
not give the same physical positions in space, we still see a consistent
pattern for the build up.

are consistent with the freefall timescale for the BH, which depends on M but not m whilst the cloud mass is negligible. This
is reasonable as the oscillating scalar should behave roughly
as matter for GMm > 1, which simply falls in radially under the gravity of the BH (note that our initial conditions do
not provide it with angular momentum for support). The bottom panel of Fig. 6 shows the energy flux across spheres of
radius r∗ , calculated as dE/dt = 4πr2 (1 + M/r)6 Sr with the
momentum density Sr (r) ∝ ∂r ϕ∂t ϕ. The values are averaged
over several oscillations, showing a net inflow towards the BH
(note that the momentum density actually oscillates between
inflow and outflow over each period of scalar field oscillations). Initially the rate of inflow is roughly that of freefall in
the regions exterior to the cloud, but suppressed at the horizon,
which explains further why the cloud grows at approximately
the freefall rate for the BH – at least initially, the inflow into
the BH can be neglected. As the cloud approaches the analytic
profile, the rate of infall at the BH horizon increases, tending
towards that at larger radii, which is consistent with the idea
that the solution will settle into a steady state with a rate of
inflow which is independent of r.
Note that the growth behaviour is very different for cases
where GMm < 1, where the analytic solutions change to
standing waves and the timescales depend on m due to the
effect of the so-called “quantum pressure” from the comparably large Compton wavelength. This can be seen in the case
GMm = 0.1 that we studied, where there is a much more rapid
build up in the cloud, with negligible inflow at the horizon
(due to the reflection of the modes off the potential barrier), as
shown in Fig. 7.

Regarding the final state of the build up - in the case of
GMm = 1 it appeared that the cloud began to saturate at a constant energy density around t˜ ∼ 700Tm . However, in all cases
we found that at later times the field oscillations became disturbed, with large oscillations in the amplitudes and no clear
steady state. This is most likely due to unphysical effects from
the imposed boundaries, which do not permit ingoing waves,
and also (due to the cartesian grid) do not reflect the spherical nature of the solutions. This requires further investigation,
but notice in Fig. 1 that the spatial oscillations and r−3/4 profile spread outwards from the BH as time elapses. At some
point the boundary conditions start to be inconsistent with the
physical solution, in which the oscillations would continue to
spread outwards throughout the homogeneous field, resulting
in an inflow at r = L. In the absence of these boundary effects,
we would expect the cloud to settle into a steady state, with a
constant inflow, and a density profile set by the value imposed
at r = L.

B.

Dynamical background metric with backreaction

We now focus on the case with backreaction, in which we simultaneously evolved the fully consistent metric and scalar
field profiles. There are three key effects which are neglected in the non backreacting case, which we have taken
into account here. Firstly, the accretion of the cloud onto the
BH leads to a time varying mass which means that the analytic profiles discussed in [33] evolve over time, albeit on a
timescale much longer than the accretion rate. Secondly, due

FIG. 6. The top panel shows the volume integral of ρ within a radius
r = 100Rs (excluding the region within the horizon) as a function
of Tm = 2π/m. In the backreaction case an energy decrease is observed due to the effect of the cosmological expansion, but the other
cases consistently show a growth. There are small oscillations in the
growth on the timescale of the mass but these are not visible in the
plot. The bottom panel shows the energy flux dE/dt across spheres
of radius r∗ , averaged over several periods, for the case GMm = 1
without backreaction. Note that the relatively high flux values are
the result of the large value of ρ0 used in our simulations, and one
would expect the actual rates to scale with ρ0 accordingly.

FIG. 7. Both plots show the low mass case GMm = 0.1 without
backreaction. The top panel shows the volume integral of ρ within
a radius r = 100Rs (excluding the region within the horizon) as a
function of Tm = 2π/m. In contrast to the higher mass cases shown
in Fig. 6, the value oscillates every cycle between a maximum and
minimum value due to the standing wave nature of the solution. The
rate of growth is also more rapid and faster than the freefall timescale.
The bottom panel shows a timelapse of the energy flux dE/dt across
spheres of radius r∗ , with the dotted line showing the value averaged
over several periods. The point of zero average flow corresponds to
the node see at r∗ ∼ 100Rs in Fig. 4.

to the backreaction of the cloud on the metric, the background
spacetime around the black hole is a perturbed Schwarzschild
solution, showing imprints of the scalar density. Finally, the
non zero asymptotic density results in an asymptotically de
Sitter spacetime, with expansion that dilutes the cloud, rather
than the asymptotically flat case. All of these effects could
potentially disturb the build up of the scalar clouds.
The plots in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 compare the profiles and evolution of the scalar field as a function of time in the backreacting and non-backreacting cases. Whilst for backreaction
the dynamical gauge means that the field cannot be directly
compared at the same radial coordinate, the two do show a
very similar rate of build up, meaning that, at least in the initial stages, backreaction does not suppress the growth of the
cloud.
Whereas the build up shows roughly the same growth in
the amplitude at a given coordinate radius in the backreacting
case at a fixed tortoise coordinate r∗ as in the non-backreacting
one, in the former the energy density of the cloud is actually being diluted by the expansion of the spacetime as the
average scale factor increases by about 10% during the simulation. Therefore, as illustrated in the top panel of Fig. 6,
the overall energy of the cloud within a (coordinate) radius
r = 100Rs decreases over time. This illustrates that, depending on the asymptotic energy density of the field, the dilution
due to expansion plus the infall into the BH may out-compete
the growth of the cloud. Partly this is due to the fact that the
energy density of the cloud will scale as radiation rather than
matter (due to the contribution of gradients). However, the
value we have used of ρ0 ∼ 10−10 R−2
s in our simulations is orders of magnitude bigger than physically relevant scales, such
as those in DM halos, and then only shows a small decrease.
We thus conclude that the backreaction of the scalar on the
metric and the effects of cosmological expansion should not

disturb the build up significantly in realistic scenarios.
In Fig. 8 we quantify the non-zero value of the 4D Ricci
scalar as a result of the presence of the cloud, calculated as
(4) R = 8π(ρ − S) with S the isotropic stress of the scalar field.
The absolute values are compared to the square root of the
Kretchmann Scalar for the BH KBH = 12R2s /r6 and the Ricci
scalar for the cosmological spacetime RC = 24πGρ0 . Whilst
the effects close to the BH are small relative to the curvature
of the BH itself, further out the deviations become significant,
and asymptote to values of order RC , but with a characteristic
oscillating imprint with a spatial scale related to m.
Whilst the effects studied in the backreacting case here are
small in physically realistic scenarios, the effects may be enhanced by the addition of angular momentum, or in binary
cases where resonances can occur in the scalar mass and the
orbital period. These simulations therefore represent a significant step in going beyond the static background approximation, which is necessary if one wants to study the impact on
the gravitational wave signal from DM environments in such
cases.

DISCUSSION

We have shown how massive scalar hair can emerge in
a dynamical situation, with non-trivial time-varying boundary conditions set by cosmology. The scalar hair grows
even in simulations in which backreaction from the metric is
taken into account, stabilizing into a scalar field cloud. The
growth timescales of the cloud are comparable to the freefall
timescales for the BH in high mass cases GMm & 1, with the
scalar cloud feeding off the reservoir at the boundary. In low
mass cases GMm  1 the growth is much more rapid, and
standing wave profiles develop. Including backreaction, we
find that the scalar field profile evolution is very similar, only
diluted by the cosmological expansion for the values chosen
– for more realistic density values this effect would be small.
We find a profile of oscillating deviations to the Ricci scalar
with a scale set by m, which propagate outwards from the BH
over time.
To illustrate the potential cloud sizes, consider the example
case of a solar mass BH in a background of DM with density ∼ M /pc3 and a homogeneously oscillating region of size
L ∼ pc. We assume that, as in our simulations, the region outside of this area is oscillating homogeneously, providing an
(in principle) infinite source of scalar particles which feeds the
BH and its cloud. We have seen that the energy density redistributes into a r−3/2 profile in a time related to the freefall time
 3/2
Rs (or faster), with the field profile matching the
tff ∼ RLs
amplitude imposed at the boundary. We can thus quantify the
time to reach a final state as ∼ 10 million years, with ρ at the
horizon ultimately enhanced as:

that is, by a factor of 1019 in our example case. The equivalent figures for a supermassive BH like the one in M87, with

8
M ∼ 1010 M in a kpc sized region, is an enhancement of 109
on a timescale of ∼ 1 million years. Here we neglect the impact of the growing mass of the BH due to accretion of the
scalar during this period, which would not materially change
the magnitude of the final state, although note that the BH can
grow by a significant fraction of its initial mass in this time,
as calculated in [33]. The size of the induced curvature from
this energy density is still, however, extremely small in comparison to the curvature of the BH, with ρ ∼ kg m3 even in the
more favourable solar mass case.

e.g. [40–42]) merit further investigation, particularly where
the binary systems have timescales similar to 1/m where one
expects interesting resonances (see e.g. [43–45]). With the
tools developed in this work, we plan to explore these questions in the future.

While we are interested in the end state of the process – a
quasi-stable configuration of scalar hair – our primary interest
has been in how the hair is formed dynamically and whether
backreaction affects can spoil this build up in high density regions. With new windows on the Universe – the detection
of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO/VIRGO [1, 2], and
the imaging of the event horizon of the BH in M87 [3] – we are
probing BHs in ever more dynamical situations. In this context, the impact of non trivial scalar clouds on a merger (see

Whilst the scalar DM case is one of the best motivated applications of these studies, we note that our results would also
apply to non-DM cosmological scalars, for example, a scalar
that is part of a modified gravity model. Even very tiny coherent oscillations, on cosmological scales, would build up in
amplitude around BHs in a similar way to what we describe
here, leading to modifications to GR localised around BHs
which increase over time. We intend to study such effects further for specific models in future work.
We emphasise that our discussion neglects angular momentum, which should reduce the infall and change the picture for
a more physically realistic scenario. We would still expect
similar clouds to build up, only with an angular spatial dependence in the profile related to the relevant spherical harmonics.
The angular momentum may also permit the clouds to grow
larger, since in principle it would provide additional support
against infall.
