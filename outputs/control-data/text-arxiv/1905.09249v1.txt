Abstract
The purpose of this article is to prove that the anti-Wick symbol of an operator mapping S(Rn ) into S ′ (Rn ),
which is generally not a tempered distribution, can still be defined as a Gelfand-Shilov generalized function.
This result relies on test function spaces embeddings involving the Schwartz and Gelfand-Shilov spaces. An
additional embedding concerning Schwartz and Gevrey spaces is also given.

Keywords: Anti-Wick symbol, Gelfand-Shilov generalized functions, pseudodifferential calculus, Gevrey spaces,
test function spaces embeddings.

Statement of the result.

For any operator A mapping S(Rn ) into S ′ (Rn ), it is well known that the Weyl symbol σ W eyl (A) and the
distribution kernel KA are tempered distributions on R2n satisfying (with the notations of [8]):

or equivalently:

(1.2)

(The above spaces S(Rn ) and S ′ (Rn ) refer respectively to the standard Schwartz space and its topological dual).
The two identities (1.1) and (1.2) are naturally understood in the sense of tempered distributions. Recall that
these equalities can be regarded as a basis of Weyl pseudodifferential calculus [7].
Besides, an operator A can also be given under the form:
Z
−n
< Af, g >= (2π)
F (X) < f, ΨX >< ΨX , g > dX

(1.3)

R2n

where the ΨX are the coherent states:
ΨX = τX Ψ0 ,

n

2

Ψ0 (u) = 2 4 e−π|u| ,

τ(x,ξ) f (u) = f (u − x)e2iπ(u− 2 )·ξ
x

(X = (x, ξ) ∈ R2n , u ∈ Rn ) (1.4)

and where F is, for instance, a bounded continuous function on R2n , called anti-Wick symbol of A. This symbol
can be denoted σ AW (A). For that purpose, see, e.g., [2, 3, 4, 8].
In this case, it is well known that:
σ W eyl (A) = 2n σ AW (A) ∗ e−2πΓ
1

where Γ(X) = |X|2

(1.5)

(where ∗ is the standard convolution product) or equivalently:
1

σ W eyl (A) = e 8π ∆ σ AW (A)

(1.6)

(where ∆ denotes the Laplacian operator).
Our aim here is to prove that it is always possible to define the anti-Wick symbol of any operator A mapping
S(Rn ) into S ′ (Rn ). This symbol is not a tempered distribution, but a Gelfand-Shilov generalized function
([5, 6]).
1

First, one can a priori define a linear form T (A) on the space e 8π ∆ S(Rn ) by:
1

< T (A), e 8π ∆ ϕ >=< σ W eyl (A), ϕ >,
One then has:

ϕ ∈ S(Rn ).

1

σ W eyl (A) = e 8π ∆ TA .

(1.7)

As a consequence and by analogy with (1.5), one can consider that T (A) is by definition the anti-Wick symbol
of A.
Next, Theorem 1.1 below proves that T (A) defined above is actually also a Gelfand-Shilov generalized function.
Before stating Theorem 1.1, let us recall here the definition of the space S(λ, µ)(Rn ) of these test functions used
by Gelfand and Shilov [5, 6]. See also, e.g. [9, 10, 11] for applications and [13] for related spaces.
The space S(λ, µ)(Rn ) refers to the space of functions ϕ ∈ C ∞ (Rn ) such that, there exists a constant A > 0
satisfying for all multi-indices α and β, for all x ∈ Rn :
|xα ∂xβ ϕ(x)| ≤ A|α|+|β| (α!)λ (β!)µ .

(1.8)

The following Theorem is proved in Section 2.
Theorem 1.1. If λ > 0 and 0 < µ <
1
e 8π ∆ S(Rn ).

then the space S(λ, µ)(Rn ) is continuously embedded in the space

As a consequence, one obtains that the anti-Wick symbol T (A) of any operator A mapping S(Rn ) into S ′ (Rn ),
is well defined (by restriction) as a continuous linear form on S(λ, µ)(R2n ) for any λ > 0 and any µ < 21 . That
is, T (A) is a Gelfand-Shilov generalized function.
Let us also mention the following fact as a complementary result concerning anti-Wick symbols. In [1], one
provides conditions written in terms of the action of an operator A on coherent states to ensure that the antiWick symbol of A is a bounded continuous function on R2n . Also note that this latter result is actually to be
compared with Unterberger result [14] giving a similar necessary and sufficient condition in order that the Weyl
symbol of A is a C ∞ function on R2n , being bounded together with all of its derivatives.
Theorem 1.1 is proved in Section 2 and a related test function spaces embedding concerning Gevrey spaces is
given in Section 3.

Proof of Theorem 1.1.

The Proposition below follows from Proposition 6.1.8 of Nicola-Rodino [12] but we give a proof for the sake of
the reader convenience.
Proposition 2.1. Suppose that λ > 0 and 0 < µ < 1. Then, any function in S(λ, µ)(Rn ) extends to a
holomorphic function u on Cn satisfying for some constant K > 0:
eϕ(x) |u(x + iy)| ≤ Keψ(y) ,

|Ayj | 1−µ ,

(2.2)

where the constant A > 0 is the constant in (1.8).
Proof of Proposition 2.1. For any x > 0, one has:
sup
k≥0

If λ > 0, this yields for all x ∈ Rn :

eϕ(x) ≤ sup

If ν > 0 and x > 0, one has:

Therefore, for all u ∈ S(λ, µ)(R ) with µ < 1 and ν = 1 − µ:

Thus inequality (2.1) with (2.2) is valid and the proof is then complete.

Next, we denote by E(Cn ) the space of holomorphic functions ϕ on Cn satisfying for all m ≥ 0:
Z
2
e−2π|Imz| (1 + |Rez|)m |ϕ(z)|dz < ∞.

Proposition 2.2. If λ > 0 and µ < 21 then any element of S(λ, µ)(Rn ) can be extended to a holomorphic
function belonging to E(Cn ). This defines a continuous embedding of S(λ, µ)(Rn ) into E(Cn ).
Proof of Proposition 2.2. One notices for the function ψ defined in (2.2) that:
2

eψ(y) = e2π|y| g(y)
where the function g belongs to L1 (Rn ) if µ < 21 . Besides, the function e−ϕ(x) is rapidly decreasing if λ > 0.
Then, Proposition 2.2 follows from Proposition 2.1.

The following Fourier transform is used in the sequel:

Proposition 2.3. For any u ∈ E(Cn ), there is a function Φ ∈ S(Rn ) such that e 8π ∆ Φ is equal to u restricted
to Rn .

Proof of Proposition 2.3. Let u be any function belonging to E(Cn ). Then, one has:

This function ψ belongs to S(Rn ) and verifies:

Thus, one observes that the function Φ defined by:

Φ(x) =

κ(ξ)e2iπx·ξ dξ

is indeed satisfying:

1

e 8π ∆ Φ = u.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. It is a direct consequence of Propositions 2.2 et 2.3 when replacing n by 2n.

An additional embedding.

We give here a supplementary embedding involving Schwartz and Gevrey spaces.
We begin with the following Lemma.

where the Hm are the Hermite functions.
One checks that:

The proof of the Lemma thus follows.

The Gevrey type space Gs considered here is defined as the space of smooth functions f such that, there exist
K > 0 and C > 0 satisfying for all multi-indices α ∈ Nn and all x ∈ Rn , |∂xα f (x)| ≤ KC |α| (|α|!)s .
We then obtain the next result.

Proposition 3.2. If the function f ∈ S(Rn ) then the function e 8π ∆ f belongs to the Gevrey space G 2 (Rn ).
Proof of Proposition 3.2. Recall that:
n

1

e 8π ∆ f = 2 2 f ∗ e−2πΓ ,

Γ(x) = |x|2

for any f ∈ S(Rn ). According to Lemma 3.1 above, there exists C > 0 satisfying:
1

∂xα e−2πΓ(x) ≤ C 1+|α| (α!) 2
for any multi-indice α ∈ Nn and all x ∈ Rn .
This proves Proposition 3.2.
