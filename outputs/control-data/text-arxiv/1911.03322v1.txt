Methods of optical dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) open the door to the replenishable hyperpolarization of nuclear spins, boosting their NMR/MRI signature by orders of magnitude. Nanodiamond powder rich
in negatively charged Nitrogen Vacancy (NV- ) defect centers has recently emerged as one such promising
platform, wherein 13 C nuclei can be hyperpolarized through the optically pumped defects completely at room
temperature and at low magnetic fields. Given the compelling possibility of relaying this 13 C polarization to
nuclei in external liquids, there is an urgent need for the engineered production of highly “hyperpolarizable”
diamond particles. In this paper, we report on a systematic study of various material dimensions affecting optical 13 C hyperpolarization in diamond particles – especially electron irradiation and annealing conditions that
drive NV- center formation. We discover surprisingly that diamond annealing at elevated temperatures close to
1720◦ C have remarkable effects on the hyperpolarization levels, enhancing them by upto 36-fold over materials
annealed through conventional means. We unravel the intriguing material origins of these gains, and demonstrate
they arise from a simultaneous improvement in NV- electron relaxation time and coherence time, as well as the
reduction of paramagnetic content, and an increase in 13 C relaxation lifetimes. Overall this points to significant
recovery of the diamond lattice from radiation damage as a result of the high-temperature annealing. Our work
suggests methods for the guided materials production of fluorescent, 13 C hyperpolarized, nanodiamonds and
pathways for their use as multi-modal (optical and MRI) imaging and hyperpolarization agents.

Introduction: – The development of quantum sensors over
the past decade has heralded new opportunities for harnessing
the power of quantum technologies in the real world. This includes, for instance, the ultrasensitive probing of magnetic [1]
and electric fields [2], as well as temperature [3, 4] and inertial
rotations [5, 6]. The workhorse platform of this class has been
the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy NV- defect center in diamond, driven by the exquisite room-temperature coherence time
of its electronic spin, along with the dual ability to spin polarize
and interrogate it through optical means [7].
Particulate forms of NV-center endowed diamond “quantum
materials” portend additional applications that stem from their inherently high surface area and targeting ability through surface
functionalization [8, 9]. Nanodiamond (ND) particles, for instance, can be serve as deployable and “in cell” quantum sensors [4, 10–12]. An exciting emerging application involves harnessing lattice 13 C nuclear spins in these diamond particles as
an auxiliary resource. Particularly attractive is the hyperpolarization of these 13 C nuclei via the optically pumped NV centers,
placing them in athermal spin configurations that have greatly enhanced NMR signatures [13]. The 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal can often be enhanced by several orders of
magnitude, in a manner completely independent of particle orientation, with the hyperpolarization being carried out at room temperature and with relatively benign resources. Indeed, such optical methods for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) [14, 15]
present several advantages over conventional methods involving
cryogenic temperatures and large magnetic fields [16], since the
hyperpolarization can be generated replenishably and under am-

bient conditions and with modest resources (low optical and microwave powers) [17, 18]. As a representative example, Fig. 1A
demonstrates small 18µm microparticles having large nuclear polarization levels ≈0.23% in just under a minute of optical pumping. This corresponds to a gain of ∼230 over their Boltzmann
polarization at high field (7T) (4×105 over a polarizing field of
38mT), and to a million-fold time acceleration of imaging these
particles in MR imaging [19].
Several compelling applications open as a result. The optical pumping leads to an associated, simultaneous, bright fluorescence from the NV- spins that is non-blinking and non-bleaching.
Harnessing the dual-mode bright nature of these particles in both
the optical as well as MR domains opens new avenues for them
to serve as imaging agents in disease diagnosis and monitoring [19, 20]. Moreover, nanodiamond particles inherently possess large surface areas (∼57m2 /g for 100nm particles [21]), and
along with the long lifetimes of the 13 C spins, allow hyperpolarized surface 13 C nuclei to serve as spin polarization relay channels
to external nuclear spins. One could envision, for instance, a liquid coating on the particles being spin-polarized via the surface
nuclei through Overhauser contact [22].
While the gains in hyperpolarization can be impressive, experience indicates that material factors play a key role in ultimately setting the obtained 13 C polarization levels. This comes
as no surprise; indeed, there has been tremendous progress in the
last decade in fabricating diamond particles that are materialsoptimized for fluorescence brightness [23–25]. This includes
diamond growth, e-irradiation, and annealing conditions, that
have enabled diamond particles to become some of the brightest
and most photostable targetable fluorescent agents available [26].
However, analogous optimization of material conditions for optical hyperpolarization is several-fold more challenging. Apriori,

nealing conditions. We focus on high-pressure high-temperature
(HPHT) diamond particles [28], given their relative ease of production at scale. To distill effects from each material dimension
separately, we consider particles fabricated from identical starting
parent materials. While confirming the critical effect of the lattice quality to ultimate 13 C hyperpolarization levels, we discover
a surprising new effect upon sample high temperature annealing
(HTA) for 15 min at ∼1720◦ C , which enables a large boost in the
hyperpolarization levels, in some cases by over an order of magnitude compared to conventional diamond fabrication. Our data
reveals the intriguing origins of these gains, including the crucial
role played by paramagnetic impurities in bounding both the electronic as well as the nuclear lifetimes.

it is uncertain if conditions that produce optically brightest particles (typically few ppm of NV- center concentration and annealing at 850◦ C ) are also those that make them maximally NMR
bright. A rich confluence of factors dictate at once the buildup
of 13 C hyperpolarization, and optimized materials are contingent
on having high initial polarization and long coherence times on
the NV- electron (source), along with a long lifetime on the 13 C
nuclei (target). These, in turn, are strongly determined by interactions with paramagnetic impurities and lattice distortions. No
doubt, these factors are quite different from conditions for radicalinduced hyperpolarization at cryogenic conditions [27].
In this paper we unravel the various material dimensions that
govern optical 13 C hyperpolarization in diamond particles. We accomplish this through combined electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) and NMR relaxometry studies, along with probes of hyperpolarization buildup and decay behavior for over 30 samples,
produced with controllably engineered electron irradiation and an-

High mass 13 C hyperpolarization: – We consider type Ib
HPHT particle samples (Hyperion) with identical ∼100ppm nitrogen content and compare their relative performance for room
temperature DNP at Bpol ≈38mT, close to the optimal field for
hyperpolarization (see Methods [29]). The particles (all at natural
abundance 13 C) are illuminated with 520nm laser light to initialize the NV- electrons to the ms = 0 state, and subjected to chirped
microwave (MW) irradiation over the NV- EPR spectrum to transfer polarization to the 13 C lattice (see Fig. 1) [17, 30]. Note that,
in this paper, we will refer to the NV center as being in its negatively charged state, and ignore effects of charge dynamics. Fig.
1B shows typical hyperpolarization buildup curve, saturating in
∼90s of optical pumping. Polarization transfer under the MW
sweeps (Fig. 1C) proceeds through a sequence of rotating frame
Landau-Zener transitions [31] to relatively weakly coupled 13 C
nuclei, and subsequent spin-diffusion serves to homogenize the
polarization in the bulk lattice. Interactions of the 13 C nuclei with
other lattice spins, especially paramagnetic impurities, contribute
to the leakage of polarization to unmeasurable degrees of freedom
that effectively manifests as T1 relaxation, bounding the overall
polarization level.
Experimentally, the hyperpolarized 13 C NMR signals are measured at high field (7T), accomplished by rapidly shuttling the
sample prior to measurement. Benchmarking the hyperpolarization level of each sample against its counterpart 7T Boltzmann
value is unwieldy and time-consuming, since a typical thermal
measurement takes over 30h for discernible SNR, limited by low
sample filling factor (. 10−4 ) in detection. Instead here, we adopt
an alternate strategy. For a fair comparison, we mass normalize
the hyperpolarization signals from the various samples and benchmark each sample against the unit mass thermal NMR signal at 7T.
We report these DNP enhancement factors, henceforth labeled ε,
which correspond to absolute polarization levels ≈ 0.1ε%.
Technically, to ensure the entire mass (5-30mg) of the diamond
particles (occupying .18mm3 volume immersed in water) is polarized uniformly, we employ a laser illumination geometry that
serves to penetrate all particle facets and ensure homogenous powder polarization in spite of scattering and penetration losses. This
is accomplished by using eight 800mW fiber-coupled lasers arranged along an octagonal ring, along with another collimated
laser that excites the sample from the bottom, approximating a
hemispherical excitation pattern (see Fig. 1D-E). The optical excitation (∼570mW/mm2 ) is minimally obstructed by the MW coil,
which is a split-solenoid of 9mm diameter (see Fig. 1E), and
with an exceedingly low MW power density (∼2.5mW/mm3 ).
To quantify the effectiveness of this excitation geometry consider that, for instance, Ck1 ,k2 refers to the obtained DNP enhancement employing laser numbered k1 and k2 on the octagonal ring together. We now consider (Fig. 1F) the DNP signal

Effects of increasing electron fluence – First, considering the
effects of particle size by studying particles obtained through
milling identical starting materials, we find a decrease in hyperpolarization levels at small particle sizes, 100nm particles performing worse by about an order of magnitude compared to 18µm particles (see Supplementary Information [29]). However since this
is strongly conditioned on the harder to control material degradation due to milling, we will consider a more systematic study
elsewhere. Instead, for clarity, we focus here almost completely
on diamond particles that are identically milled to a uniform size
18±3µm, all starting from the same parent material. we consider
in Fig. 2 samples prepared under varying fluences of electron irradiation and standard annealing conditions (850◦ C for 2hrs), both
of which can be precisely controlled. Naively, the increasing fluence results in an increasing NV- center concentration that should
seed a greater polarization in the 13 C lattice. Practically, however, this is associated with concomitant lattice damage, as well
as an increased paramagnetic defect concentration, resulting in a
decrease in 13 C T1 times, and manifests as an inherent tradeoff
in the hyperpolarization levels with fluence. This is evident in
the experiments in Fig. 2A where we observe a DNP optimum at
≈ 5×1018 e/cm2 , which we estimate from EPR data to correspond
to an NV- concentration of ∼4ppm (upper axis). Furthermore, the
DNP enhancements correlate with the optical brightness of the
particles (red line in Fig. 2A), which also decreases at higher fluences, here due to the generation of paramagnetic optical traps.
Fig. 2B, for instance, shows representative micrographs taken
under a 617nm long-pass filter highlighting the relative particle
brightness.
Continuous wave X-band (9.4 GHz) EPR measurements (at
room temperature) highlight underlying lattice conditions responsible (Fig. 2C). We calibrate g-factors and densities Ns of paramagnetic S = 1/2 species against a reference sample of purified
detonation nanodiamond (ND) powder with g = 2.0028(2) and Ns
= 6.3×1019 spins/g [32]. Spectra recorded in the half-field (g = 4)
region allow reliable quantification of NV- (W15) triplet centers,
tracking EPR lines originating from forbidden (∆ms = 2) transitions between triplet state Zeeman levels. Fig. 2C illustrates that

the red line to N = 2 (NN pairs), and the green points to N = 3
(NN triples). DNP levels here are shown in a polar plot, where the

represents laser k above. The approximately circular ring-like patterns in Fig. 1F demonstrates the spatially homogeneous buildup
of polarization in the powder samples. The slight deviations from

separated by n simultaneously, and normalized by the effect of
them both applied separately. We find that (see [29]), to a good
approximation, the different lasers contribute to hyperpolarization
in different parts of the sample volume, and the near hemispherical excitation leads to uniform polarization buildup.

increasing electron fluence leads to the growth of g = 4.274(5)
NV- center signals; and while at low fluences (5×108 e/cm2 ), the
NVs dominate the spectrum, higher fluences are associated with
the appearance and strengthening of additional signals, here attributable to W16-W18 and W33 triplet defect centers. We emphasize that for clarity, the spectra in Fig. 2C focus on the spectral
region close to the NV- peaks, and do not show the primary lattice
paramagnetic defects which also change in concentration (see Fig.
4C and [29]).
The presence of paramagnetic spins bottlenecks hyperpolarization buildup in the high e-fluence samples. Indeed, the saturation
hyperpolarization values reflect a dynamic equilibrium between
NV- -induced polarization injection into the lattice 13 C nuclei, and
its inherent decay due to nuclear T1 processes. If βi and βd denote
the (assumed monoexponential) polarization injection and decay
rates respectively, the buildup

rameters provide valuable insight into the material conditions that
affect hyperpolarization levels; if for instance βd is large, polarization saturates at a low value in spite of high NV- concentrations.
The buildup and decay curves are however, in general, weakly
bi-exponential (see Fig. 2A) on account of disparate behavior between directly NV- -coupled 13 C and weaker bulk nuclei. We can

The extracted 13 C relaxation rates grow steeply for the high
e-fluence samples (Fig. 2D), and as the representative decay
curves from low and high fluence samples in Fig. 2D(iii) indicate, the differential in T1 values can be as large as 5 times.
We emphasize that the nuclear T1 (spin-lattice) relaxation here
is not phonon mediated; instead, at the operational hyperpolarization fields, it originates predominantly from stochastic spinflipping noise produced at 13 C sites from lattice paramagnetic
electrons [33]. This mechanism is dominant since the nuclear Larmor frequency, ωL = γn Bpol (for instance ≈380kHz at 38mT)
can lie within the dipolar-broadened
EPR linewidth. Specifically,

measure indirectly the cumulative effect of the paramagnetic spins
on the 13 C nuclei and are agnostic to their exact lattice origin. The
steep increase in relaxation rate in Fig. 2D therefore reflects the
deleterious increase in paramagnetic content on the 13 C nuclei,
effectively increasing hdee i (see also Fig. 3C).
Similarly, turning our attention to the extracted polarization
injection rates (Fig. 2E), we observe a saturation and decrease
with increasing electron fluence. This is somewhat counterintutive, since naively an increase in NV- concentration should result in a greater number of sources seeding polarization into the

C lattice. However the NV-13 C polarization transfer is a coherent process, and Fig. 2E strongly suggests that the transfer
efficiency per MW sweep event is decreased in the higher fluence
samples. This is potentially due to the reduction in NV- center
coherence time T2e from interactions with the surrounding paramagnetic spin bath [36], as well as charge noise from lattice ionic
nitrogen species [37]. Fig. 2 therefore illustrates that while would
one like to electron irradiate samples to maximize the number of
NV- centers, this comes at a steep cost of lattice damage and paramagnetic impurity content, and strongly countervails against 13 C
hyperpolarization buildup.
High temperature annealing enabled DNP gains – The samples considered so far were subjected to standard annealing, conditions that maximize optical fluorescence luminosity. On the
other hand, annealing at higher temperatures could have a conciliatory role by relieving lattice disorder, due to the evolution and
reorganization of defects [38]. Motivated by this, we consider the
effect of ultra-high temperature annealing on the hyperpolarization levels, employing a water-cooled annealing furnace (Fig. 3A)
that allows precise temperature control as well as rapid temperature rise times (see Methods). While the annealing process constitutes a multi-dimensional parameter space dependent on temperature, annealing time, and sample environment conditions; here
we consider an important subset of these conditions, focusing on
annealing in the 1700-1800◦ C range, where NV- centers can be
preserved while paramagnetic content decreased [39] (Fig. 4A).

Figure 4. EPR spectra at X-band, revealing lattice origins of the HTA-driven hyperpolarization gains. (A) Schematic of defect center evolution typical
to HTA with changes in annealing time and temperature (axes). We target a HTA condition between 1700-1800◦ C (dashed lines). (B) EPR spectra at
high electron dose (D2 = 5×1019 e/cm2 ), displaying NV- centers and spectrally closeby paramagnetic impurities (W33) centers (see also [29]). HTA
(red) suppresses the W33 and W16-W18 centers in its conventionally annealed counterpart (black). This manifests in EPR spectra similar to samples
irradiated at low dose (see Fig. 2C). Inset: Zoom in on the accompanying triplet defect centers. (C) P1 center EPR spectra shows an increase in P1
concentration under HTA, indicating lattice reorganization of nitrogen from N+ to P1 (total nitrogen content in all samples is identical ≈100ppm). (D)

transitions in [29]). (F) Extracted T1e times through exponential fit of the saturation curves in (E) (see [29] for similar data on forbidden transitions).
There is a boost of about an order of magnitude in electron T1e in the 1720◦ C HTA sample compared to conventional annealing.

We concentrate here on two representative classes of samples,
those irradiated at (i) D1 =1.5×1019 e/cm2 (Fig. 3B-C) that were
optimally fluorescent in Fig. 2C, and (ii) at the maximum fluence level D2 =5×1019 e/cm2 (Fig. 3D-E), possessing close to
the largest NV- center concentration. Our observations (see Fig.
3B,E showing mass normalized 13 C spectra) indicate that HTA
in the 1700-1800◦ C range can consistently lead to large improvements in the hyperpolarization levels over conventional annealing
at 850◦ C . For the D1 samples (Fig. 3B), HTA boosts polarization
levels by ∼3x, while for the D2 samples (Fig. 3E), originally close
to worst performing in Fig. 2C, we find a large 36-fold increase
(arrow in Fig. 3E) in the magnitude of DNP enhancement levels under optimal 1720◦ C HTA (shaded in Fig. 3E). This allows
these samples to leapfrog to the best overall for hyperpolarization
despite initially showing very poor performance. If employed in
13
C hyperpolarized MR imaging [19], this would correspond to
a substantial acceleration just by changes in the annealing conditions. These large gains are at once both surprising and technologically significant, since annealing at 1720◦ C is not substantially more technically challenging than at 850◦ C (Fig. 3A) [40],
and time and temperature control opens new parameter spaces for
lattice defect manipulation.
We notice moreover that a wide range of temperature conditions, anywhere in the 1200-1800◦ C range, can yield substantial
DNP improvements. Interestingly, short-time post-annealing a
sample originally annealed at 850◦ C at 1400◦ C for 1hr can al-

ready increase DNP levels by ∼3x (second trace in Fig. 3E).
The data also reveals the importance of relatively rapid HTA, extended annealing for instance 50min can lead to significantly degraded performance (fifth trace in Fig. 3E). We observe that the
exact environment of the annealing does not matter strongly, although a H2 atmosphere is marginally better and can also serve
to reduce diamond graphitization [39] (Fig. 3E). To put in perspective the best HTA performance under the two electron doses,
illustrating that D2 samples outperform the lower fluence samples (&1.5x greater than any of the samples considered here), and
indicating that the high NV- concentration now can be usefully
harnessed. The best performance corresponds to a bulk 13 C polarization ∼0.3% (Fig. 1A) and is the highest reported optical hyperpolarization level on crushed particles <20µm in size. Finally, the
data in Fig. 3B-D strongly indicate that these DNP signal boosts
can be explained atleast partially by the strong (∼ 3-5x) increase
in 13 C relaxation times as a result of HTA. This is most evident
in the representative polarization decay curves in the inset of Fig.
3E. We also observe a measurable increase in the polarization injection rates under HTA (inset in Fig. 3D).
We now employ a combination of NMR relaxometry and quantitative EPR data to unravel lattice origins of these HTA-driven
gains. Considering first the effect on increasing 13 C relaxation
times, we find that this increase occurs across all magnetic fields
(Fig. 3C). To illustrate this, we use a recently developed NMR
relaxometry method [33] to quantify R1 (B) = 1/T1 , mapping

6
the nuclear relaxation rates with magnetic field. Experiments are
performed with a home-built field cycler device [41], rapidly shuttling the sample to the field of interest where the spins are allowed
to relax for a waiting period t, and subsequently detecting the polarization decay at 7T. Stepping over values of t unravels the full
T1 decay curve at every field point, here with high precision (50
field points) over 100mT-3T (Fig. 3C). In practice, we further accelerate the data acquisition using a dimension-reduction protocol
outlined in Ref. [33]. Fits to an exponential decay ∼ exp (−t/T 1)
allow extraction of field-dependent rates R1 (B), which display
characteristic step-like dependencies with field (shown in a linear
scale in Fig. 3C and log scale in the inset), growing steeply by over
2 orders of magnitude at low field and saturating beyond ∼100mT
to a relatively long T1 value (≈10min). The relaxometry profiles
widths ∼ hd2γeeni report on the interactions of the 13 C nuclei with
lattice paramagnetic spins [33]. In these experiments, we cannot
resolve differences between the exact paramagnetic spin species,
but instead measure their net effect on the 13 C nuclei. The effects
of HTA are now clearly evident (see Fig. 3C); it leads to markedly
modified NMR relaxometry profiles, narrowing them (over 20%)
even for the low fluence samples (D1 =1.5×1019 e/cm2 ) considered here. As a consequence, at any hyperpolarizing field, there is
an increased time over which the 13 C polarization can buildup in
the lattice, and consequently an enhanced saturation polarization
level.
Complimentary aspects are revealed by X-band EPR spectra
(see Fig. 4), where we focus on the samples irradiated with the
higher fluence D2 = 5×1019 e/cm2 , since they present the largest
relative gain in DNP levels in Fig. 3. Fig. 4A schematically
displays the expected propagation of lattice defects under HTA
conditions, and indicates the possibility of reducing radiation induced damage. We speculate that the HTA gains occur beyond the
temperature corresponding to the offset of N diffusion ∼1500◦ C ,
since some of the triplet defects might be associated with complexes of N and vacancies (Fig. 4A). Consider first Fig. 2C the
case when the starting sample is annealed additionally at 1400◦ C .
The elevated temperature now causes the complete disappearance
of W17-18 and W33 defects (top trace in Fig. 2C), although
at the cost of some reduction of NV- concentration. The W16
content, on the other hand, remains practically unharmed in this
case. Moving on to high temperature annealing in the 17001800◦ C range (dashed lines in Fig. 4A), the effect on the triplet
defects content is even more pronounced (red trace in Fig. 4B);
most evident in the inset in Fig. 4B that zooms into the spectral
region near g=4.196. The HTA treatment at 1720◦ C completely
eliminates all other e-beam induced triplet centers while only
slightly affecting the NV- content. Indeed, a fraction of the N
atoms congregate into groups of 2-3 N atoms and combine with
vacancies forming non-paramagnetic H3 and N3 color centers
(Fig. 4A). It is remarkable that the high NV- density samples upon
HTA treatment begin to resemble the triplet defect free spectra
(second-to-last trace in Fig. 2C) that characterize the samples at
low electron fluence. The high NV- concentration (∼4ppm greater
than Fig. 2C) is now available free of adverse triplet paramagnetic
content [42]. In the Supplementary Information [29] we present
similar EPR spectra under a range of annealing conditions, showing progressive lattice quality improvement with annealing temperature.
Annealing also affects the pool of primary defects, evident in
the EPR spectra in Fig. 4C (see [29]): increasing the remanent
substitutional nitrogen defects P1 centers (blue bars in Fig. 4D),
and modestly decreasing the content of negatively charged vacan-

cies V- , dangling bonds and N2 centers, deformation-produced
dislocations decorated by nitrogen [43] (green bars in Fig. 4D).
To explain this, we note that while the diamond samples considered here all have identical ∼100ppm of total nitrogen content,
however a predominant proportion manifest as N+ ions that are
not paramagnetic and hence are invisible in EPR. The increase in
the P1 center concentration upon HTA, while a somewhat surprising observation, reflects the lattice reorganization from N+ to P1
at high temperature. This likely serves to reduce the charge noise
seen by the NV- centers and can potentially contribute to their increased coherence times as well as T1e lifetimes.
Indeed the most dramatic change upon HTA is found in the
spin-lattice relaxation times of the NV- centers (Fig. 4E-F). We
note that NV- T1e is critical because at the relatively low laser
illumination levels and slow MW sweeps we employ (200/s), it
dictates the level to which the NV- spins are polarized, ultimately
bounds the 13 C nuclear polarization [17, 44]. T1e times here are
estimated by fitting progressive microwave saturation curves obtained for low-field allowed and forbidden (g = 4.274) lines of
the NV- EPR spectra, to a two-component model and assuming
that the slow and fast relaxing entities originate form the same
species. The saturation curves in Fig. 4E (and [29]) indicate
that faster relaxing species become saturated at higher MW power
levels whereas sharp saturation peaks correspond to slower relaxing spins. It is evident in Fig. 4E that HTA causes prolongation of spin-lattice relaxation times (see [29] for related data
on the forbidden transitions). The longest T1e values, found for
HTA 1750◦ C (vacuum) and HTA 1720◦ C treatments - and are
about an order of magnitude longer than those conventionally
850◦ C annealed (Fig. 4F).
It emerges therefore from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 that the HTA enabled DNP gains arise from an interplay between increasing 13 C
relaxation time by ∼3-5x, increasing NV- center T1e by ∼10x, as
well a suppression in adverse triplet paramagnetic impurity content, all of which can be traced to HTA-driven healing of the
diamond lattice disorder caused by radiation damage. Indeed,
the best sample studied (HTA at 1720◦ C ) stands out with respect to its conventionally annealed counterpart; and is characterized by both a relatively high (7ppm) NV- content and a long
>1ms electron T1e , as well as a complete absence of other e-beam
induced triplet centers except for NVs. In contrast, the original 850◦ C annealed sample had the highest content of remanent
paramagnetic vacancies and secondary triplet centers, as well as
the shortest T1e values and only moderately higher NV- content
(∼12ppm). We anticipate that larger gains are possible through
further optimization of the HTA process, and while demonstrated
here for 18µm particles, we expect these would gains also be
translatable to nanodiamond samples.
Applications in multi-modal imaging: – Apart from enhanced
hyperpolarization, HTA fortuitously also endows the particles
with the surprising property of being fluorescent in more than
one color under different excitation wavelengths [39]. This effect arises due to the formation of NV- , H3 and N3 centers, and
mixtures thereof, conditional on and controllable via the annealing temperature. Fig. 5B for instance demonstrates this for the
best samples for hyperpolarization (HTA at 1720◦ C ), where the
same particles glow in the dark-green, light-green or red based
on the UV (350nm), blue (470nm) or green (532nm) excitation
wavelengths. Fig. 5A shows the measured PL spectra, displaying
a wide separation in the dominant fluorescent wavelengths. Fig.
5C-E highlights the strong differences to the conventionally annealed (850◦ C ) sample, wherein the PL is always predominantly

in the red. We clarify however that HTA does not measurably enhance PL brightness from their values in Fig. 2B, indicating that
while DNP is more contingent strongly on the underlying lattice
quality, while PL is more strongly conditioned on fluorescence
quenching charge traps [45].
That said however the PL brightness is still substantial, and
importantly, combined with natively high-contrast hyperpolarized
13
C MR imaging that HTA-fabricated particles offer, multicolor
optical imaging can allow new multimodal imaging avenues. Indeed, we envision the diamond particles being imaged under MRI
as well as more than one optical wavelength simultaneously [19].
This is aided by the fact that hyperpolarization can be carried out
under any wavelength λ .575nm. Not only can imaging therefore
proceed at the two widely disparate frequencies (RF and optical)
simultaneously, but as we showed in recent work [19], exploiting the reciprocal space nature of optical and and MR imaging
can lead to substantial imaging acceleration in practical settings.
In addition, both optical and MR modalities can be individually
signal modulated on-demand, engendering lock-in techniques that
can strongly suppress image backgrounds [19]. It is in this context that the current work bears importance, since it provides a
simple “materials-only” means to increase diamond 13 C MR image signal-to-noise (SNR), while also concurrently allowing fluorescence in multiple optical channels, all of which portend approaches for high-fidelity particle tracking in-vivo [46].
Conclusions: – We have demonstrated the potential of high
temperature annealing towards boosting NV-center driven 13 C hyperpolarization in particulate diamonds at room temperature. At
high NV- concentrations, the use of HTA at 1720◦ C allows a boost

in hyperpolarization levels by over an order of magnitude. We
leveraged combined EPR and NMR techniques to systematically
unravel origins of these surprising gains, studying DNP under several material dimensions including NV- center concentration, annealing conditions and particle size. It emerges that HTA serves
to relieve radiation induced lattice disorder in the diamond lattice,
reducing the triplet paramagnetic content, and increasing both the
NV- and 13 C T1 lifetimes by factors greater than 3-5 fold each.
Overall this reveals the central role played by lattice quality in
determining the final saturation 13 C hyperpolarization levels and
suggests methods for the guided discovery of high quality nanodiamond particles for enhanced spectroscopy and MR imaging.
We anticipate that the lattice benefits from HTA will also translate to improved samples for quantum sensing and magnetometry [47, 48], especially in the limit of high NV center densities.
Finally, high temperature annealing opens interesting opportunities for defect center manipulation, with potentially wider applications in quantum computing platforms in solids [49, 50].

Methods: – Hyperpolarization at room temperature is carried
out by nine fiber-coupled 520 nm laser diodes (Lasertack) at a
38mT polarizing field generated by a pair of Helmholtz coils. A
self shorted split-solenoid coaxial line connected to a 16W MW
amplifier provides the microwave excitation that initially consists of frequency chirps generated from three cascaded voltage
controlled oscillator (VCO) sources driven by a home-built quad
ramp voltage generator [18]. The diamond particles are immersed
in water to leverage scattering-induced uniform illumination, as
well as for heat sinking. DNP signals are measured in a 7T Oxford magnet subsequent to sample shuttling to high field. This is
achieved by a home-built field cycling stage consisting of a precise belt-driven actuator stage (Parker) with 50µm precision [41].
Shuttling times are measured to be ≈640ms, small compared to
13
C nuclear T1 .
Annealing of irradiated diamond powder in standard regime
(800-900◦ C ) was done using a Blue Lindberg Model 848 furnace. Higher temperature annealing was performed using an allgraphite furnace, model HTT-G10, MEO Engineering Company,
adapted to treatment of diamond powder with a special graphite
sample container (Fig. 3A). Heating could be ramped up to the target temperature within minutes. For annealing of diamond powder
at 1700-1800◦ C the heating up time was about 3min, then temperature was maintained for specified time at target temperature
(±10◦ C ) and followed by cooling down within 3min to about
500◦ C and about 5min for cooling down to room temperature.
Temperature was measured using a W-Re thermocouple calibrated
against melting points of pure Al, Au, Cu, Si, Ni, Pt, Pd, Rh and
Mo. In majority of experiments HTA annealing was performed
in hydrogen atmosphere. For a comparison in the experiment of
annealing at 1750◦ C both hydrogen and vacuum had been used.
Photoluminescence measurements in Fig. 2B and Fig. 5 at
room temperature were performed after each step of annealing.
Analysis was performed using a using an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescent microscope and a modular USB spectrometer
(HR2000, Ocean Optics). Excitation from a mercury lamp was

8
filtered with a D350/50x band pass filter (Chroma) for UV excitation and BLP01-405R long pass emission filter (Semrock);
FF01-470/28 (Semrock) bandpass filter for blue excitation measurements, with emission collected using a BLP01-488R (Semrock) long pass filter; and BLP01-532R (Semrock) bandpass filter
for green excitation measurements, with emission collected using

a BLP02-561R (Semrock) long pass filter. The microscope is also
fitted with an 5.0 MP CCD color camera for simple color imaging
applications (AmScope, MT5000-CCD-CK). Room temperature
(T=295K) EPR measurements in Fig. 4 were carried out at using a
Bruker EMX-220 spectrometer equipped with an Agilent 53150A
frequency counter.

SIZE DEPENDENCE OF HYPERPOLARIZATION
ENHANCEMENTS

We consider in Fig. S1 the dependence on particle size, employing particles starting from the same parent material that have
been fractionally milled to sizes as low as 100nm nanodiamonds
NDs. Hyperpolarization in small particles is important both for
applications employing them as agents for optical DNP of external liquids, as well as for MRI imaging of the particles themselves.
This is on account of their increasing surface area to volume ratio
that scales linearly with decreasing particle size, and the fact that
small NDs can be safely injected into (and ejected from) in-vivo
target disease locations.
We find the DNP enhancements decreasing with particle size
(see Fig. S1B), which we speculate to be arising from the increased role of crushing related surface effects at smaller particle
sizes. There is also NV− / NV0 stronger charge dynamics at play
for smaller NDs under under optical pumping. When normalized
by the effective particle surface area to volume ratio however, the
100nm ND sample provides the best overall hyperpolarization efficiency, pointing that they are still most suitable amongst other
particles as an agent for external polarization. Moreover, we observe no direct correlation in the spin relaxation lifetimes with size
at least down to 100nm. The enhanced T1n lifetime of the 3µm
particles in Fig. S1A were because although the same electron

lower doses result in lower lattice damage and consequently high

ADDITIONAL EPR DATA

We provide here the raw data of the EPR measurements that
form the basis of Fig. 4 of the main paper. Consider first Fig.
S2, which displays the EPR spectra of primary defects with and
without high-temperature annealing, and from which the concentrations in Fig. 4D are extracted. It is evident that HTA has an
impact on the primary defect concentration, increasing the P1 concentration, while slightly decreasing the concentrations of V- and
N3 defects.
Similarly Fig. S3 contains the raw data of the EPR spectra in the
spectral range close to the NV- center, and showing the triplet defect centers. It is here that the effective HTA is most pronounced:
there is a steep decrease in the triplet defect center concentration
(W16 ,W33) while the NV- concentration is only weakly affected.

EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS

We now provide more details on the hyperpolarization experimental setup. We refer the reader to a detailed exposition in
Refs. [17, 18], but sketch the apparatus here for completeness.
Generating bulk polarization in the diamond powders relies continuous laser pumping at low-fields, and subsequent sample transfer to high field (7T) magnet for NMR inductive readout. Transport of the samples is controlled by a rapid motion actuator (Parker
HMRB08) with precision ±50µm from point-to-point. Actuator software allows for a programmable S-curve motion profile,
with the device moving up along the magnetic field axis with
2m/s velocity and 30 m/s2 acceleration for a length of approximately 1.6m. The transport system was tested to confirm its
consistency over more than 1400 trials, finding a mean transport
time of 648±2ms between the polarization of the sample under
the magnet and NMR detection. 13 C polarization is detected at
75.03MHz by printed copper NMR saddle coils laid around a
quartz tube. The diamond powder samples were placed into the
bottom of NMR tubes (Wilman 8mm OD, 1mm thickness), and
then filled to about three quarters the length with distilled water.
To maximize the surface area exposed to laser irradiation during
optical pumping, an octagonal 8-laser system has been designed
(see Fig. 1E) composed of fiber optic cables (Thorlabs M35L01)
that emit the 532nm radiation from diode lasers assembled below
the polarization region. These cables are arranged symmetrically
onto an octagonal puck structure with the DNP microwave coil at
the center, allowing synchronous application of microwaves with
this improved laser excitation design. A ninth fiber optic cable is
additionally fed below the sample. The puck design allows for

stacking of identical multi-laser devices that will be useful for
proportional gains in samples of diamond powder of greater total mass, with applications in using larger total surface area to
transfer polarization to liquids.
In an effort to characterize the uniformity of the obtained hyperpolarization in the sample, we perform in Fig. S5 experiments similar to Fig. 1F of the main paper employing identical
200µm diamond particles (Element6), but with differing masses.
We consider the limit of low and high masses (8mg, 40 mg) respectively. The nearest neighbor laser hyperpolarization charts in
Fig. S5A, and the accompanying scaling of the hyperpolarization with the number of lasers (Fig. S5C-D) show a faster saturation for the lower mass. We note that compared to Fig. 1F,
the larger particles employed here have a lower optical penetration, but even for these large particles masses of .20 mg can be
almost completely optically polarized. Importantly in Fig. S5E,
we unravel the effect of each laser on the hyperpolarization process, by considering the correlation of the obtained hyperpolarization enhancements in the case of employing two lasers that are
not necessarily nearest neighbor only. In particular, we employ
laser numbered kj and laser kj+n , separated along the octagonal
ring simultaneously. We compare the effect on the hyperpolarization signal Ckj ,kj+n to the sum of the signals, (Ckj + Ckj+n ),
obtained applying the
P two lasers separately. The normalized result, hCk,k+n i = 18 j Ckj ,kj+n /(Ckj + Ckj+n ), averaged over all

DATA PROCESSING

In this section we discuss the experiment protocols used to generate buildup and decay curves (see Fig 2 of main paper) for
the various diamond samples. The buildup curves are obtained
through normal operation of the hyperpolarization apparatus and
field cycler as described in the previous section, with sole variation in the duration of hyperpolarization time (laser pumping
time). Decay curves are similarly generated by now polarizing
for a fixed time and adding a variable wait time before NMR detection. Sweeping of the NV- ms = +1 manifold at 200Hz and
36mT is maintained synchronously with 520nm laser irradiation
for all polarization detection experiments to maximize 13 C polarization.
Next we discuss the evaluation and signal enhancement calculation of our NMR data, which is done through a phasing and
fitted enhancement calculation. The data is first phased through
a zero-order correction that attempts to minimize the imaginary
value parts of the peak, and maximize the real values. This is
done through multiplication by a phase value, and this value also
determines the sign of the peak (positive or negative). Because
the zero-order phasing does not always fix the entire spectrum,
the data is then baseline-corrected with a 12th order polynomial.
A Lorentzian is fit through the entire data, and the peak limits are
defined such that they enclose 90% of the total Lorentzian curve
area; data on the sides of the peak limits are considered the base-

Let us now consider details of the experiments mapping the 13 C
relaxation times in diamond as a function of magnetic field. We
refer the reader to a more detailed exposition in Ref. [33]. T1
relaxation of the nuclear spins arise from spin-flipping processes
that randomly flips their nuclear spin, for which the Hamiltonian
is of the form,
HI = ωL Iz + hAzx i sz (t)Ix .

(1)

where s(t) is a stochastic variable. This Hamiltonian can arise
in an effective rotating frame, for instance due to the coupling of
13
C spins to a reservoir of dipolar coupled paramagnetic spins in
its vicinity. In a highly simplified picture, pairs of paramagnetic
spins spatially remote to the 13 C nucleus and undergoing spin flipflops can flip the 13 C spin if its energy ωL = γn B determined by
the magnetic field is within the dipolar coupling spectrum of the
bath electrons, i.e. ωL ≤ hdee i. In previous work we had demonstrated this electron mediated process as being the dominant relaxation mechanism at low-moderate fields, and operational at fields
under which hyperpolarization is carried out. Measuring the field
profile T1 (B) can spectrally fingerprint the processes underlying
the relaxation. To carry out these experiments, we interface the
hyperpolarization setup with a precision field cycling instrument.
At every field point in the 100mT-3T range, a relaxation curve is
obtained in order to extract the effective T1 relaxation time for the
spin that field. Perhaps most illustrative in the data is that samples
with prepared by RTA conditions show a much narrower T1 (B)
field profile. This directly translates to the fact that at any field
location, the relaxation time of the sample is much longer. Consequently, there are larger DNP enhancements,since the polarization
can buildup in the sample for a longer period.
As an outline of the steps in the processing of the relaxation
data, the signal enhancement as a function of time can be described using the following equation:
t

(t) = o e− T1 .

(2)

where o represents the initial enhancement before any signal decay is observed. Values for (t) for the two samples in Fig. 3C
were obtained by first optically pumping the samples for 60 seconds and measuring their decay over a time span of 30 seconds
for a range of fields between 0 and 3500 Gauss. For each set
field value, the enhancement after 30 seconds of depolarization
was measured 10 times and then averaged. The initial enhancement value o was obtained by again pumping each sample for
60 seconds and taking the enhancement value after zero waiting time. This process was repeated 30 times and the resulting
o values were then averaged. Once the initial enhancement and

13
field dependent enhancement values were obtained, the relaxation
rates R1 could be calculated
by rearranging the previous equation:

ln

o

(t)
.
R1 = T11 =
t
The sum of two Tsallian functions was then constructed to fit
the relaxation data (solid lines in Fig. 3C). This is described by
the following equation:

where the fit parameters A1 and A2 represent the amplitudes, w1
and w2 the widths, c represents the vertical offset, and q1 and q2
tell us if the function more closely represents a Lorentzian or a

were then allowed to vary until they were optimized.

tion, and the effective NV-13 C hyperfine couplings. The effective
polarization injection is an average effect over the entire sample.
While the injection rate is reflect in the polarization buildup curves
that we measure, these curves also include the inherent polarization decay in the samples. To a good approximation, the injection
rates can be quantified as the effective difference between the DNP
buildup and decay curves at any field.
We can estimate the effective polarization buildup and decay
rates by assuming a monoexponential growth and decay and constructing the following differential equation,
d(t)
= −β1  + β2 [Po − ]
dt

where  is the enhancement as a function of time, Po is the initial polarization, β1 is the decay rate, and β2 is the injection rate.
Solving this differential equation and applying the initial condition (t = 0) = 0 since we note that the average polarization can
not build up or decay instantaneously, we find:
(t) =

V.

INJECTION RATE CALCULATIONS

We define the injection rate as the rate at which the hyperpolarization is injected from the NV- centers spins to the 13 C reservoir. The efficiency of this hyperpolarization process depends on
several factors such as NV- center coherence time, laser penetra-

Since the rates in practice are actually bi-exponentials, we evaluate the effective rate constants by finding their 1/e crossing times.
This allows us to calculate the effective polarization injection rates
as well as the error bars arising from the difference between the
two exponentials.
