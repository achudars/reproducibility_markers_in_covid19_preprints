Abstract
ABSTRACT: We demonstrate, for the first time, the operation of a bubble-assisted Liquid Hole Multiplier
(LHM) in liquid argon. The LHM, sensitive to both radiation-induced ionization electrons and primary
scintillation photons, consists of a perforated electrode immersed in the noble liquid, with a stable gasbubble trapped underneath. Electrons deposited in the liquid or scintillation-induced photoelectrons emitted
from a photocathode on the electrode‚Äôs surface, are collected into the holes; after crossing the liquid-gas
interface, they induce electroluminescence within the bubble.
After having validated in previous works the LHM concept in liquid xenon, we provide here first
preliminary results on its operation in liquid argon. We demonstrate the bubble containment under a Thick
Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM) electrode and provide the detector response to alpha particles, recorded
with SiPMs and with a PMT - under electroluminescence and with modest gas multiplication; the imaging
capability is also demonstrated.

1. Introduction
The concept of Liquid Hole-Multipliers (LHMs) was proposed [1] for the combined detection of
ionization electrons and primary scintillation photons generated along charged-particle tracks in
noble liquids [2-7]. The original goal was to deploy LHM units within a single-phase noble
liquid TPC, aiming at simplifying the structure and thus overcoming potential technological
issues that may occur in large-volume dual-phase TPC detectors. The latter are the leading
instruments in current dark-matter searches [8] and are part of the future neutrino-physics
program [9, 10].
A conceptual scheme of a bubble-assisted LHM module is depicted in Figure 1. It consists of a
perforated electrode (e.g., a gas electron multiplier (GEM) [11], or a thick gas electron multiplier
(THGEM) [12]) immersed in the noble liquid, with a stable gas-bubble trapped underneath; the
latter is formed by an array of thin heating wires. Once formed, the bubble fills the space below
the electrode and remains stable as long as the system is in a thermodynamic steady state.
Radiation-induced electrons deposited in the liquid or scintillation-induced photoelectrons
emitted from a CsI photocathode deposited on the electrode‚Äôs top surface, are collected into the
electrode‚Äôs holes; after crossing the liquid-gas interface, they generate electroluminescence (EL)
within the bubble. The LHM electrodes are held at different potentials, assuring the efficient
collection of ionization electrons and scintillation-induced photoelectrons into the electrode‚Äôs
holes and their extraction into the bubble - where they induce EL; the resulting photons are
detected with photo-sensors located underneath.
In our LHM-based ‚Äúlocal dual-phase‚Äù TPC concept (Figure 1), a prompt scintillation signal (S1)
is followed by two EL ones. The first, S1‚Äô, results from S1 photons, extracting photoelectrons
from CsI into the bubble; the second one, S2, results from ionization electrons focused into the
holes. While the time difference between S1 and S1‚Äô is constant, S2 arrives at a time depending
on the ‚Äúdepth‚Äù of interaction (dictated by the electrons‚Äô drift velocity in the liquid).
2

The new concept has been validated in series of works carried out in liquid xenon (LXe) [2-7].
Best results in terms of light yield and energy resolution were reached with a single-conical
GEM perforated electrode: EL yield ~400 photons/e-/4 and energy resolution ~5% RMS (for
~7000 alpha-induced ionization electrons in LXe) [6]. Imaging of an alpha-particle pattern
performed with a quad-SiPM coupled to a THGEM-LHM, permitted its reconstruction with a
resolution of ~200 ¬µm RMS [7].

Figure 1 Conceptual scheme of a LHM detector. A hole-electrode (GEM/THGEM) with CsI photocathode deposited on its top surface
is immersed in the noble liquid. Heating wires generate a vapor bubble underneath the electrode; the bubble is laterally supported
by two walls. Ionization electron drift towards the electrode and generate EL signals. Scintillation photons extract a photoelectron
from the CsI layer and induce similar EL signal. The EL signals are read using position sensitive light readout pads (PMTs, SiPM
etc.).

In this work, we report for the first time, on the operation of a bubble-assisted LHM in liquid argon (LAr),
at a temperature of ~90 K. We discuss the operation of a THGEM-based LHM and present preliminary
examples of alpha-induced signals, energy spectra and imaging capabilities.
It is worth mentioning that EL in THGEM holes immersed in LAr has already been reported in [13];
however, in light of the present knowledge, we suspect this might have been due to sporadic bubbles
accumulating under the electrode, rather than to EL in the liquid as reported by the authors. Similarly,
electron multiplication has been reported on arrays of sharp tips immersed in LAr [14]. In another work
[15, 16], pressure-dependent components of avalanche multiplication in LAr with small Xe admixtures
were suspected to arise from Ar bubbles forming at the edge of the sharp tips.

2. Experimental setup & methodology
The experiments were conducted in a dedicated LAr cryostat, WISArD (Weizmann Institute Liquid
Argon Detector). It comprises a 100 mm in diameter, 150 mm tall cylindrical chamber filled with ~250
ml of LAr. The rest of the volume is equipped with various sensors, with the detector assembly suspended
from the topmost flange; the latter has a viewport.
Argon liquefaction is done on cooling fins cooled by a Cryomech PT90 pulse tube refrigerator.
Temperature of the liquefaction fins is maintained by a closed-loop feedback using CryoCon temperature
controller (Model 24). The liquefied argon flows in through a 1.5 m long double-wall, vacuum-insulated
transfer tube into the chamber. During operation, LAr is continuously extracted through a tube immersed
3

within the liquid, evaporated and circulated through an SAES hot getter (PS3-MT3-R) at 2-5 standard
liters per minute. The purified Ar gas returns to the liquefaction fins where it is liquefied and is let to flow
back into the chamber.
The LHM detector assembly (see Figure 2) is almost identical to the one described in [7]. It consists of a
0.4 mm thick THGEM electrode (hexagonal holes pattern 0.3mm in diameter, 0.7 mm apart). In this
proof-of-principle study, the THGEM electrode was not coated with CsI, making the detector sensitive
only to ionization electrons. Note that although a THGEM is not the best electrode in terms of light yield
and of photon detection efficiency (as described in details in [6]), it was chosen for this first
demonstration for its mechanical and electrical robustness. A 241Am alpha source was placed 4.7 mm
above the THGEM electrode. The source had an activity pattern of an annulus ~0.5 mm broad and ~3.9
mm in diameter with total activity of ~190 Bq (see [7] for details). A grid of heating wires (Ni-Fe, 55 ¬µm
in diameter, 2 mm spacing) was placed 1.6 mm below the THGEM. It was used to generate the bubble
and to define the ‚Äútransfer field‚Äù (ùê∏ùë° ), i.e. the field between the bottom face of the THGEM and the wires.
For convenience, we will quote the values of the transfer field as if it was a parallel plate between the
bottom face of the electrode and the heating wires; this is only indicative, as the actual electric field is non
uniform, being high close to the bottom part of the THGEM hole and next to the wires [6] and lower in
the gap between them.
Since the current cryostat does not have a side window allowing to visually observe the bubble (as in
previous LXe work, e.g. [4]), the existence of the bubble was inferred from the response of the EL signals
to sudden pressure changes (as detailed in [3]).

Figure 2 Schematic view of the experimental setup. A 0.4 mm thick THGEM electrode (with 0.3 mm in diameter holes spaced by
0.7 mm) is immersed in LAr; the gas bubble underneath is formed by a grid of heating wires, spaced 2 mm apart, located 1.5 mm
below the electrode. Photons were recorded either by a PMT or by a Quad-SiPM array (shown here), located at ~6 mm under the
wire grid. Ionization electrons focused into the holes induce EL light (S2) in the bubble; a fraction of the primary scintillation
photons (S1) traverses the holes and is detected as well.

Readout of the EL photons was done by direct digitization of the signals from the photosensors, located
~6 mm below the wire grid, using a Tektronix (MSO 5204B) oscilloscope. Two photosensors were used:
(1) a PMT (Hamamatsu R8520-506) vacuum-coated with ~300 ¬µg/cm¬≤ of TPB (Tetraphenyl butadiene)
wavelength shifter and operated at -800 V. The PMT has a fast response and therefore allows for signal
4

shape reconstruction. (2) A four-elements windowless SiPM (Hamamatsu VUV4 MPPC S133716050CQ-02, total area 12x12 mm¬≤); the quad-SiPM permitted 2D event-position reconstruction. The
SiPM was operated at -46V as per the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendation. However a full study of its
operation at cryogenic temperatures has not yet been performed. Therefore, the resolutions quoted here
are preliminary and may improve in future work.
The recorded waveforms were analyzed using dedicated Matlab scripts. Position of the event was
reconstructed by a center-of-gravity technique as described in [7].

3. Results
Prior to biasing of the THGEM electrode, current was driven through the heating wires in order to
generate a bubble (30V across 61Œ© for ~10 seconds). Once formed, no further heating was applied to the
wires. As previously shown [3], the EL signals disappeared upon sudden rise in the pressure and
reappeared immediately after its sharp decrease. While not being able to visually see the bubble in the
present setup, this confirms its existence. All measurements where conducted at a liquid temperature of
90K, corresponding to a pressure of 1365 mbar.

3.1 Typical signals
With the LHM detector polarized to Œîùëâùëáùêªùê∫ùê∏ùëÄ = 3,000ùëâ (keeping ùê∏ùëë = 1 ùëòùëâ/ùëêùëö and ùê∏ùë° = 0 ùëòùëâ/ùëêùëö),
typical signals as recorded with the TPB-coated PMT are shown in Figure 3; Figure 4 depicts signals
recorded from the four SiPMs‚Äô pads. The green marked pulses are that of the primary scintillation light
(S1); the red ones originate from the EL photons from the bubble (S2). One can observe a longer S2
decay constant (3-4 ¬µs) compared to that in LXe (e.g. see [6]). There are indeed different processes in
LAr, with longer time scales than in LXe. First, Ar has two decay constants for the scintillation or EL
signal, 5 ns and 860 ns, as opposed to Xe where the longest timescale is 27 ns [17]. Then, the transition of
electrons from liquid to gas has, according to [18], both long and short timescales. None of them,
however, can explain the 3-4 ¬µs decay constant, observed with the two different sensors. This matter will
be part of further studies.

3.2 Energy resolution
For each event, the pulse area under each waveform was computed and a pulse-area histogram was
plotted. An example recorded with Œîùëâùëáùêªùê∫ùê∏ùëÄ = 3,000 ùëâ ùê∏ùëë = 1 ùëòùëâ/ùëêùëö and ùê∏ùë° = 0 ùëòùëâ/ùëêùëö, recorded
with the PMT at liquid temperature of 90¬∞ K is shown in Figure 5. A Gaussian fit was applied for deriving
the resolution and the mean value.

deriving the mean value and the RMS resolution.

Figure 6a shows the pulse-area as a function of the voltage across the THGEM electrode (keeping ùê∏ùëë =
1 ùëòùëâ/ùëêùëö and ùê∏ùë° = 0 ùëòùëâ/ùëêùëö) and Figure 6b shows the RMS resolution. The linear trend shown in
Figure 6a indicates EL without charge gain [17]. The RMS resolution was measured to be 13.5%. This
value is ~2-fold worse than the one achieved in LXe and requires additional studies. Similar response to
that measured with the TPB-coated PMT was confirmed with the windowless quad-SiPM.

3.3 Amplification in the transfer gap
As discussed in details in [3] and in [6], the light yield can be boosted by increasing the electric field
between the bottom of the THGEM electrode and the heating wires beneath (ùê∏ùë° ). At moderate values of
ùê∏ùë° (~2 kV/cm), this results in EL generated at the vicinity of the heating wires in addition to the one
occurring mainly at the bottom of the holes. At more intense fields, the electrons generate EL all along
their path within the bubble: from the bottom of the hole to the wires. Figure 7 shows the average pulseshape obtained at different ùê∏ùë° values. One can clearly see the addition of a second EL pulse, occurring
~0.5 ¬µsec after that originating from the vicinity of the THGEM hole; it results in a significant increase in
signal magnitude.

ùõ•ùëâùëáùêªùê∫ùê∏ùëÄ = 3,000 ùëâ ùëéùëõùëë ùê∏ùëë = 1 ùëòùëâ/ùëêùëö.

An example of the resulting pulse-area spectrum recorded with the PMT with ùê∏ùë° = 15 kV/cm is shown in
Figure 8. It is interesting to observe that at such high ùê∏ùë° value, pulses resulting from the 59.5 keV gamma
particles (emitted by the 241Am) become visible. The data was recorded here with ùëâùëÉùëÄùëá = ‚àí725 ùëâ to
avoid signal saturation. One should notice that although the gamma- and the alpha-particles differ in their
energy by almost two orders of magnitude, their response in the LAr-LHM detector differ only by a factor
~4.5. This is due to the known different recombination probabilities of the ionization electrons, between
the dense alpha-induced ionization and sparse density of electrons induced by the gamma-rays [17, 19].
The peak position the Gaussian fit is depicted in Figure 9, as a function of ùê∏ùë° . Once can clearly see that
above ~4 kV/cm, the pulse-area grows exponentially, indicating upon modest (~10-fold) chargeavalanche multiplication at the vicinity of the wires.

(green), to the 59.5 keV gamma interactions in LAr.

3.3 Position reconstruction
Similar to the methodology presented in [7], the integral of the pulse from each of the four SiPM pads
was computed for each event. The event position was then reconstructed by a center-of-gravity method.
An auto-radiographic image (using a Fuji phosphor-imager scanner model FLA-9000, plate model BASTR2040S) of the 241Am alpha source used in our experiments is shown in Figure 10a. The 2D histogram
of the derived event positions, recorded in LAr with the LHM (of Figure 2), is shown in Figure 10b. This
very preliminary qualitative image reproduces the annular shape of the alpha source. However, the
reconstruction resolution is, at this point, poorer in comparison to the ~200 ¬µm RMS one, recorded with
LXe-LHM [7], calling for further investigation.

4. Summary and discussion
In this work, we have demonstrated, for the first time, the operation of an LHM detector in LAr. We have
shown that similar to LXe, a bubble can be generated in LAr and is sustained for a long period under a
THGEM perforated electrode immersed in the liquid. Electroluminescence (EL) within the Ar bubble,
induced by ionization electrons deposited by alpha particles in LAr and collected into the electrode‚Äôs
holes, shows a linear response with the applied voltage, as expected in such process. Electrons drifting
within the bubble towards the heating-wires grid induced modest charge-avalanche multiplication.
Imaging of the alpha-particle induced EL photons was demonstrated, qualitatively, with the quad-SiPM.
This preliminary demonstration paves ways towards a more elaborate and quantitative study of the
bubble-assisted LHM detector in Ar. It will encompass the optimization of the perforated electrode
geometry, study of the physical processes governing electron transfer through the liquid-gas interface,
optimization of the readout (SiPM, PMT etc.) and of other parameters. We thus expect enhancing the (yet
non-calibrated) EL light yield and improving the localization resolution over a broader ionization range.
The combined detection of ionization signals and scintillation photons, with CsI-coated perforated
electrodes, will be investigated in detail.
Although at its early stages of research and development, it is planned to investigate the merits of the
LHM concept as a potential tool in future large-volume noble-liquid experiments. E.g., the LHM-based
TPC is part of the R&D program of DARWIN ‚Äì the future LXe-based dark matter experiments [20]. The
LAr-based LHM could also be considered in the context of many other fields where LAr is the
technology of choice, including Dark Matter searches [21], neutrino physics [9] as well as neutron
detection in the contexts of future nuclear-physics experiments (e.g. [22]), homeland security [23] and
many more.
