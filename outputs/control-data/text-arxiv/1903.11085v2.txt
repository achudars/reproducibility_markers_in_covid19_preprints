ABSTRACT
Context. The physics and demographics of high-redshift obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still scarcely investigated. New

samples of such objects, selected with different techniques, can provide useful insights into their physical properties.
Aims. With the goal to determine the properties of the gas in the emitting region of type 2 AGN, in particular, the gas metal content,
we exploit predictions from photoionization models, including new parameterizations for the distance of gas distribution from the
central source and internal microturbulence in the emitting clouds, to interpret rest-frame UV spectral data.
Methods. We selected a sample of 90 obscured (type 2) AGN with 1.45 ≤ z ≤ 3.05 from the zCOSMOS-deep galaxy sample by
5σ detection of the high-ionization C iv λ1549 narrow emission line. This feature in a galaxy spectrum is often associated with nuclear
activity, and the selection effectiveness has also been confirmed by diagnostic diagrams based on utraviolet (UV) emission-line ratios.
We applied the same selection technique and collected a sample of 102 unobscured (type 1) AGN. Taking advantage of the large
amount of multiband data available in the COSMOS field, we investigated the properties of the C iv-selected type 2 AGN, focusing on
their host galaxies, X-ray emission, and UV emission lines. Finally, we investigated the physical properties of the ionized gas in the
narrow-line region (NLR) of this type 2 AGN sample by combining the analysis of strong UV emission lines with predictions from
photoionization models.
Results. We find that in order to successfully reproduce the relative intensity of UV emission lines of the selected high-z type 2 AGN,
two new ingredients in the photoionization models are fundamental: small inner radii of the NLR (≈ 90 pc for LAGN = 1045 erg s−1 ),
and the internal dissipative microturbulence of the gas-emitting clouds (with vmicr ≈ 100 km s−1 ). With these modified models, we
compute the gas-phase metallicity of the NLR, and our measurements indicate a statistically significant evolution of the metal content
with redshift. Finally, we do not observe a strong relationship between the NLR gas metallicity and the stellar mass of the host galaxy
in our C iv-selected type 2 AGN sample.

1. Introduction
There is solid observational evidence that the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies is

tightly connected to nuclear stellar activity and the formation
of spheroids (Richstone et al. 1998). The correlation between
the masses of SMBHs and the velocity dispersions and masses
of their host stellar spheroids (Kormendy & Richstone 1995;
Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et al.
2000) suggests that the fueling of the central black hole must be
linked to the spheroid growth. The star formation in the nuclear
region of the galaxy is indeed predicted to contribute to the overall bulge stellar population (Schmitt et al. 1999; Cid Fernandes
et al. 2001). In addition, the similar cosmic trend of the rates
of star formation and central black hole accretion, both peaking around redshift '2 with an exponential decline at later times
(Madau & Dickinson 2014; Silverman et al. 2008; Franceschini
et al. 1999), further supports a coevolution of black holes and
their host galaxies. Both theoretical and observational studies
have been undertaken to comprehend the evolutionary link between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies, but
the underlying mechanisms responsible for this coevolution are
still far from being fully understood. In particular, spectroscopic
analyses devoted to studying the properties, such as metal content, geometry, and gas dynamics, of the emitting gas in the
narrow-line region of the AGN, which extends up to the kiloparsec scale (e.g., Netzer et al. 2004), are fundamental to better understand the AGN-host coevolution in terms of gas-fueling
toward the central SMBH and of the impact of gravitational accretion on the gas content of the host galaxy. A representative
census of AGN over a wide range of cosmic time is therefore
crucial to shed light on the role of central SMBH in this symbiosis with the host.
It is now generally accepted that z∼2 is a critical epoch for
galaxy evolution, as both the global star formation rate (SFR)
and the AGN activity peak at about this redshift (Hopkins & Beacom 2006; Richards et al. 2006a; Delvecchio et al. 2014). The
chemical evolution of galaxies and active nuclei at their center in
these crucial times therefore provides important clues to understand their build-up processes. AGN inhabit galaxies where the
central SMBH is accreting the surrounding gas during its activity phase. The accreted gas possibly keeps the imprint of the past
star formation of the bulge. By measuring the gas metallicity in
regions surrounding the AGN, it could be possible to obtain indirect information on the host star formation history. In particular,
given the larger spatial extent of the NLR emitting gas compared
to the broad-line region (BLR), estimating the metallicity using
the AGN narrow emission lines could be particularly promising
as they are more suited as proxy of the host galaxy properties. A
fortiori, this holds not only at low redshift, but also for the highredshift and high-luminosity AGN samples because the spatial
extent of the NLR region is larger in higher luminosity AGN, as
confirmed by a strong correlation observed between the size of
the NLR and the luminosity of the optical [O iii] λ5007 emission
line (e.g., Bennert et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2018;
Dempsey & Zakamska 2018).
Chemical abundance indicators for the NLR have mainly
been calibrated in the optical bands. Storchi-Bergmann et al.
(1998) have explored two metallicity calibrations based on
three emission-line ratios, namely [O iii] λλ4959, 5007/Hβ,
[N ii] λλ6548, 84/Hα, and [O ii]λ3727/[O iii] λλ4959, 5007,
while Castro et al. (2017) have recently proposed a metal
abundance calibration of the N2O2 parameter, defined as the
logarithm of the [N ii]λ6584/[O ii]λ3727 ratio. At z & 2, current
optical spectroscopic studies of AGN probe their redshifted
UV emission, which prevents exploiting standard metallicity
indicators. Therefore, the metal content must be estimated
by comparing the ratios of strong-UV lines detected in AGN

spectra with photoionization models (e.g., Groves et al. 2004b;
Nagao et al. 2006; Feltre et al. 2016). Recently, Dors et al.
(2014) have proposed a new index based on the C iv, C iii], and
He ii lines, that is, C43 = log[(C iv + C iii])/He ii], to study the
metallicity evolution of narrow-line AGN in a wide redshift
range (0 < z < 4). Moreover, UV-line ratios have been found
to be a valuable alternative to the standard BPT (Baldwin et al.
1981) and Veilleux & Osterbrock (1987) optical diagnostic
diagrams to distinguish between AGN and star formation activity at high redshift (e.g., Feltre et al. 2016; Nakajima et al. 2018).
In the local Universe, a strong correlation between the stellar
mass and metallicity is observed in z ∼0.1 star-forming galaxies
of the Sloan Digital Survey (SDSS; Tremonti et al. 2004). This
mass-metallicity relation (MZR; Lequeux et al. 1979) shows a
small dispersion (≈0.1 dex in gas-phase O/H ratio) and is relatively steep below 1010.5 M , but flattens at higher stellar masses.
Moving at high redshift, the MZR evolves with time in such a
way that at a given stellar mass, the galaxies had a lower gas
metallicity in the past. The MZR is usually assessed on samples
of star-forming galaxies where AGN are removed through the
exploitation of optical selection criteria, for instance, BPT diagram, the presence of broad lines in their spectra, and X-ray data
constraints (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004; Erb et al. 2006; Maiolino
et al. 2008). In the literature, the MZR of AGN, its evolution with
redshift, and a comparison with that of star-forming galaxies is
still poorly explored. Previous studies based on rest-UV spectroscopy of AGN support no evolution of the metallicity with
redshift (e.g., Nagao et al. 2006; Matsuoka et al. 2009; Dors et
al. 2014). These studies are limited both in terms of line detections, as they are mainly based on line ratios of C iii], C iv, He ii,
and in some cases N v, and the number of sources, with samples
of a few tens of objects at z∼ 2 and even lower numbers at higher
redshift.
In this work, we present the largest spectroscopic sample of
type 2 AGN at 1.5<z<3.0 drawn from the z-COSMOS deep survey (Lilly et al. 2007). We use the C iv emission line as indicator
of nuclear activity and its line profile to divide the sample into
unobscured (broad, type 1) and obscured (narrow, type 2) AGN.
We focus on the study of the excitation properties of the NLR
by comparing the ratios of the emission lines that are detected in
the spectra of our sources. We also exploit the broad-band photometry available to infer the physical properties (e.g., the stellar
mass) of the host galaxies. Our main goal is to determine the
properties of the gas in the NLR of type 2 AGN, with particular regard to the metallicity (as traced by the gas-phase oxygen
abundance, expressed in terms of 12 + log(O/H)gas ). To this aim,
we exploit predictions from photoionization models including
new parameterizations for the distance of gas distribution from
the central source and the velocity of internally microturbulent
clouds. We aim at investigating the evolution with redshift of the
gas metal content in the NLR and compare it with the properties
of the host to study the mass-metallicity relation in type 2 AGN.
This work fits into a wider project that is attempting to exploit
the high-ionization narrow emission lines to select and characterize samples of obscured AGN both at low (using [O iii] λ5007;
Vignali et al. 2010) and intermediate redshifts (via [Ne v] λ3427
detection; Gilli et al. 2010; Mignoli et al. 2013).
The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the
spectroscopic survey, the sample selection, and the classification
into narrow- and broad-line AGN, along with the observed spectral properties. Section 3 summarizes the measurements of restUV emission lines and stellar masses of the host galaxies for
the type 2 AGN sample. In Sect. 4 we describe the photoion-

ization models of the AGN NLR, and we exploit diagnostic diagrams and emission-line ratios to study the nebular properties
of the AGN NLR. Finally, in Sect. 5 we discuss the properties
of the NLR gas in our type 2 AGN sample, the evolution with
redshift of its metallicity, and the mass-metallicity relationship
in our C iv-selected type 2 AGN. The summary and conclusions
are presented in Sect. 6.

2. Sample selection
2.1. The zCOSMOS-deep spectroscopic survey

The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS, Scoville et al. 2007)
provided high angular resolution and good depth Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) imaging with single-orbit I-band ACS exposures in an equatorial field of two square degrees (Koekemoer
et al. 2007), along with ground-based images in 15 photometric
optical and near-infrared bands (Capak et al. 2007). The zCOSMOS survey (Lilly et al. 2007) produced spectroscopic redshifts
for a large number of galaxies in the COSMOS field using VIMOS, a multislit spectrograph mounted on the 8m UT3 of the
European Southern Observatory’s Very large Telescope (ESO
VLT). The zCOSMOS project has been designed to efficiently
use VIMOS by dividing the survey into two components: the
zCOSMOS-bright is a purely magnitude-limited survey, which
has collected about 20 000 redshifts for objects brighter than
I = 22.5 across the full COSMOS field. This selection culls
galaxies mainly in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.2. The second
part, zCOSMOS-deep, has targeted about 10 000 B < 25 galaxies, selected using color-selection criteria to cover the redshift
< z < 4. In this case, only the central 1 deg2 region of
range 1 ∼
∼
the COSMOS field has been observed, and the spectra of the
targeted objects have been obtained using the R∼200 LR-Blue
grism, which provides a spectral coverage from 3700 to 6800 Å.
The spectra were reduced and calibrated with the VIMOS Interactive Pipeline Graphical Interface software (VIPGI, Scodeggio
et al. 2005), while the redshifts were measured by two different zCOSMOS teams, with the support of an interactive package
(EZ, Garilli et al. 2010), and were then visually checked and validated. For more details about the zCOSMOS survey, we refer to
Lilly et al. (2009).
2.2. The C iv-selected sample

The zCOSMOS-deep survey includes 9523 spectroscopically
observed objects, but only 7635 of them (80%) have available
redshift measurements. A quality flag has been assigned to account for the redshift measurement reliability: objects with flags
4 and 3 have very secure redshifts, whereas objects with flags 2
and 1 have less secure redshifts, with decreasing spectra quality; flag 9 indicates redshifts based on a single emission line.
Moreover, a decimal place modifier (0.5) is added to denote the
agreement with the photometric redshift (see Lilly et al. 2009,
for a detailed definition of the confidence classes). In this paper
we analyze galaxies with flags 4, 3, 2.5, 1.5, and 9.5 because
their redshifts are either secure on their own or are confirmed by
the associated photo-z. To guarantee that the C iv λ1549 emission line is included in the observed wavelength range, we limit
our analysis to the redshift range 1.45 <z <3.05. The final analyzed sample contains 4391 galaxies, and their VIMOS spectra
were visually inspected and measured to select the C iv-emitting
objects.
The motivation for using the C iv emission line to select highz AGN from the zCOSMOS-deep survey is twofold: on the one

hand, the high-ionization potential of the triply ionized carbon,
C3+ , makes it a likely signature for nuclear activity, and furthermore, the C iv emission line is the most intense AGN feature in
the UV range, apart from Lyα. On the other hand, in the redshift range culled by the zCOSMOS-deep survey (1.0 <z <3.5,
see the upper panel of Fig. 1), the C iv is the most frequent spectral feature, with more than 85% of the galaxies covering the C iv
wavelength range in their spectra.
The accurate selection process consists of two main steps.
First, the C iv wavelength region is visually inspected in all the
galaxy spectra, within the redshift range where the line is visible,
to identify possible emitter candidates. The complexity of the
C iv spectral feature did not allow an automatic detection procedure, since the C iv line profile could include an AGN emission component, an absorption doublet due to the ISM, and a
stellar wind feature which should display a P-Cygni shape. This
preliminary analysis reduced the number of galaxies to be further examined to a few hundred, allowing a careful inspection
of the one- and two-dimensional sky-subtracted spectra to eliminate spurious detections (i.e., sky-line and cosmic-ray residuals).
The final pass of the selection process consists of the measurement, on the three-pixel smoothed spectra, of the putative C iv
emission line using IRAF task splot: we selected as strong emitter all the objects with a C iv emission peak five times higher
than the continuum r.m.s. estimated in 50Å windows adjacent
to the emission line. No C iv-emitter has been found in galaxy
spectra with confidence class 1.5, probably because the presence
of a strong emission line caused the assignment of a fair-to-high
redshift reliability. Following this laborious but accurate selection, we identified 192 C iv-selected AGN candidates, and their
redshift distribution is shown as an empty histogram in the lower
panel of Fig. 1.
2.3. Spectral measurements and AGN classification

The first aim of the spectral line measurement is to classify the
selected AGN candidates into narrow-line (type 2) and broadArticle number, page 3 of 14

lines are shown as downward arrows. Broad emission-line objects (with

line (type 1) objects. Because the C iv emission line is by construction ubiquitous and has an adequate signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N), it was accurately fit in all spectra, assuming a linear continuum and a Gaussian profile. In order to evaluate the quality
of the line profile fitting and to estimate the error in the measurements of the full width at half-maximum (FWHM), we performed four different line fits, using both the original raw and the
three-pixel smoothed spectra, and adopting different wavelength
regions in the continuum level determination. The results of the
first set of spectral measurements are presented in Fig. 2, where
the intrinsic FWHM of the C iv emission line is shown as a function of redshift. To estimate the intrinsic width of the line, the
observed FWHM was deconvolved by subtracting in quadrature
the instrumental resolution, FWHMinst =1350 km s−1 , as determined from sky lines. We used the width of the C iv line to carry
out the classical AGN optical classification: the objects were
identified as type 2 AGN if the rest-frame FWHM was less than
2000 km s−1 (to be conservative, we required that the FWHM
measurement plus its associated 1σ error should be below the
threshold value); otherwise, we classified them as type 1 AGN.
A few objects, especially at lower redshifts, inhabit a part of the
FWHM space near the separation limit, but an analysis of the
spectral and morphological properties of the two AGN samples
confirmed the goodness of the adopted threshold of 2000 km s−1 .
Out of the 192 C iv-selected AGN candidates, 90 are classified
as type 2 AGN, and their redshift distribution is shown in the
lower panel of Fig. 1 as the dashed histogram. The remaining
102 selected type 1 AGN were already identified as such during the zCOSMOS redshift measurement process, where broad
emission-line objects were flagged, and most importantly, no object previously identified as a quasi-stellar object (QSO) was
missed by our selection process in the redshift range of interest.

We investigated the average spectral properties of the two AGN
samples by generating and analyzing their composite spectra,
obtained by coadding all available zCOSMOS spectra included
in each class. To create the composite, each spectrum was shifted
to the rest-frame according to its redshift (with a 2.0Å bin width,
to match the instrumental pixel size at the median redshift of the
sample) and normalized to a common continuum region, which
is always observed in the spectral window. An identical weight
was assigned to each individual spectrum to avoid biasing the
final composite toward the brightest objects.
Figure 3 shows the average spectra corresponding to the
type 1 (bottom blue curve) and type 2 (top red curve) AGN samples. Both spectra show the typical AGN emission lines as labeled in the figure. A summary of the main line parameters is
also provided in Table 1. All the emission lines in the composite
spectrum of the type 2 AGN sample are consistent with being
unresolved (the upper limit of 1350 km s−1 corresponds to the
spectral resolution of the zCOSMOS-deep data), with the possible exception of the N v λ1240 line, which is apparently resolved. Comparing the equivalent widths (EW) measured in our
type 1 AGN composite with the values reported in Harris et al.
(2016) from the BOSS composite spectra (third and fifth column
of Table 1, respectively), we observe a significant difference: the
larger EWs that are measured in our C iv-selected sample can
be explained to be a consequence of the Baldwin effect (Baldwin 1977) because our AGN are fainter than thoses of the BOSS
survey.
2.5. X-ray properties of the AGN samples

The deepest X-ray coverage of the entire zCOSMOS-deep region is granted by the COSMOS-Legacy survey (Civano et al.
2016), a Chandra program that has observed the COSMOS field
with an effective exposure of '160 ks over the central 1.5 deg2 .
Of the 192 C iv-selected AGN candidates, 147 (77%) are de-

tected by Chandra within 2.5” from the optical coordinates. The
mean displacement between the AGN optical positions and their
X-ray detected counterparts is 000. 46, and all of the associations
are validated by the maximum likelihood technique (Marchesi
et al. 2016). Furthermore, the six sources with a spatial offset
larger than 100 are the true X-ray counterparts of the C iv-selected
AGN because the likelihood of finding a spectroscopic AGN in
an X-ray error box is strongly increased by their low surface
densities (Zamorani et al. 1999).
The X-ray detection rate is significantly different for the two
AGN spectral classes: more than 94% (96/102) of type 1 AGN
are detected by Chandra, whereas for the type 2 AGN, the fraction drops to 57% (51/92). This different behavior cannot be ascribed to a significantly different vignetting-corrected (i.e., effective) exposure time for the two populations. Vignali et al.
(2014) also found a striking difference in the rate of X-ray detections for AGN selected at z∼1 by the presence of the highionization [Ne v] line: 94% of the objects with broad lines in
their optical spectra showed a Chandra X-ray counterpart, while
the narrow-line AGN are detected in only one-third of the cases.
To verify that this behavior is not related to the selection criteria, we investigated the X-ray detection rate in the SDSS:
Pâris et al. (2014) cross-correlated the Data Release 10 Quasar
(DR10Q) catalog with the second XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (Third Data Release, 2XMMi-DR3; Watson
et al. 2009). Analyzing the DR10Q catalog, we find that 92.4%
of the SDSS quasars are detected in the X-rays. To perform a
similar analysis for the obscured AGN, we cross-correlated the
type 2 SDSS quasars presented in Reyes et al. (2008) with the
third XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue (3XMMDR5; Rosen et al. 2016). Of the 118 type 2 SDSS quasars included in the XMM-Newton pointings, 55 match entries in the
3XMM-DR5 catalog, corresponding to an X-ray detection rate
of 46.6%. These results reflect significant obscuration in the Xrays for the type 2 AGN (typically, the column density is above
1022 cm−2 ) and reassures us that the adopted FWHM threshold for the spectral classification effectively separates the C ivselected AGN sample into obscured and unobscured objects. A
more exhaustive analysis of the X-ray properties of the C ivselected AGN sample will be presented in a forthcoming paper
(Vignali et al., in prep.).

3. The C iv-selected type 2 AGN sample
The principal aim of this paper is to investigate the physical
properties of NLR emitting gas and their connection with the
properties of the host galaxy. The type 2 AGN sample is the
ideal laboratory for such studies because both the broad component of the emission lines and the intense radiation from the
nuclear engine are shielded by dust, allowing a better analysis of
the narrow emission lines and of the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the host galaxy. In the following, we therefore focus on
the properties of the narrow-line AGN and their host galaxies.
3.1. UV emission-line measurements

The selected type 2 AGN show various emission features in the
rest-frame UV spectral range (see Fig. 3 and Table 1). The analysis of the line ratio diagnostic diagrams, combined with predictions from photoionization models, provides a powerful tool for
probing the physical conditions within the narrow-line emitting
regions of AGN.
We computed fluxes, velocity dispersions, and EWs of the
emission lines by simultaneously fitting Gaussian profiles to
each set of lines, assuming the same FWHM for all the lines and
allowing a small shift of the central positions with respect to the
systemic redshift in order to account for the well-known offset
between emission-line peaks in quasars (Richards et al. 2002).
Fixing the same velocity dispersion for all the profiles improves
the fit for low S/N lines. This is indeed reasonable because we assumed that all lines originate from the same emitting region (i.e.,
the NLR), and most of them are dominated by the instrumental
point spread function (PSF). The continuum level was fit, in regions free of known emissions, with a polynomial function. We
used customized fitting procedures, adapted from the IRAF task
splot, to measure seven emission lines: N vλ1240 (hereinafter
N v), N iv]λ1486 (N iv]), C ivλ1549 (C iv), He iiλ1640 (He ii),
C iii]λ1909 (C iii]), C ii]λ2326 (C ii]), and [Ne iv]λ2423 ([Ne iv]).
The Lyα emission line was excluded from the simultaneous fit
because it could be severely affected by resonant scattering in
the interstellar and circumgalactic medium, internal kinematics,
and emissivity distribution, which would make the comparison
with the outcome of the photoionization models difficult. We
also avoided the line blend Si iv/O iv] at ∼1400Å.
Errors on the flux measurements were estimated following
the recipe described by Lenz & Ayres (1992):
σ(Flux) =

FluxT OT
(FWHM/∆λ)−1/2
×
,
(S /N)cont
CL

(1)

where FluxT OT is the measured flux of the emission line,
(S /N)cont is the signal-to-noise ratio of the continuum close to
the line, ∆λ is the spectral sampling, and C L is the coefficient
computed by Lenz & Ayres (1992) (see their Table 1). The computed relative flux errors are ≈10% for the brightest emission
lines (flux > 5 × 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1 ), but they increase up to ≈3040% for the faintest ones (with flux ≈2 ÷ 5 × 10−18 erg cm−2 s−1 ).
3.2. Stellar masses of the host galaxies

Stellar masses were computed using a two-component (AGN
and galaxy) SED fitting technique. Briefly, we used a combination of AGN and host-galaxy templates to fit the large set of
optical and near-infrared photometry available in the COSMOS
field, using a χ2 minimization to find the best solution that reproduced the observed flux of each object at a redshift fixed to

In order to parameterize the relative contribution of the AGN
emission over the host galaxy light, we computed the dereddened
luminosity of the two components in the rest-frame K band, using two distinct values (one for the galaxy and one for the active nucleus) of the dust attenuation provided by the SED fitting
routine. We defined the ratio between the AGN K-luminosity
and that of the host galaxy as "AGN dominance”. Reassuringly,
this ratio correlates with the rest-frame EW of the C iv emission
line, which is also a good indicator of the AGN prominence because the EW is the ratio between the flux of the AGN-powered
emission line and the UV stellar continuum (the power-law continuum from the nuclear engine is largely shielded by dust in
obscured AGN). Only five of the C iv-selected objects show an
AGN contribution lower than 20%, and all of them also belong
to the low tail of the C iv EW distribution; their rest-frame equivalent widths are smaller than 10Å. Because these objects are also
undetected in the X-rays, they are the prime suspects for being
low-luminosity AGN, if not actually pure star-forming galaxies.

the spectroscopic one. In particular, for the AGN component,
we adopted the Richards et al. (2006b) mean QSO SED as derived from the study of 259 IR-selected quasars with both SDSS
and Spitzer photometry, while the galaxy component was described using a library of synthetic spectra generated from the
stellar population synthesis model of Bruzual & Charlot (2003),
with different star formation histories and ages and assuming a
universal initial mass function (IMF) from Chabrier (2003). A
more detailed description of the method can be found in Bongiorno et al. (2012). The lower panel of Fig. 4 shows the stellar mass distribution of the host galaxies for the type 2 AGN
sample. We computed stellar masses for all but two of the C ivselected type 2 AGN because the photometric data for two objects did not allow a reliable estimate: nearby objects seriously
contaminate the data. The host galaxy stellar masses are in the
range 8.5 × 108 − 2.2 × 1011 M , with an average (median)
stellar mass of 2.1 × 1010 M (3.6 × 1010 M ). The upper panel
of Fig. 4 shows the mass distribution of the parent sample of
zCOSMOS-Deep galaxies in the redshift range where the C iv
line is present in the spectral coverage (empty histogram), along
with that of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshift flag ≥ 2,
represented by the shaded histogram. For the parent sample the
stellar masses were computed following the recipe adopted by
Bolzonella et al. (2010). We note that for our type 2 AGN sample, the stellar masses estimated by the two methods differ by
less than 30% for the majority of the cases (85%), and for the
galaxies with the largest mass disagreement, the higher value is
often computed by the method that does not include the AGN
contribution. Even when we take the different calculation methods into account, the two mass distributions are significantly different, with the type 2 AGN host galaxies peaking toward the
high-mass tail. We used a two-population Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(K-S) test to assess the significance of the difference between the
stellar masses of the galaxy parent sample and the type 2 AGN
hosts. We find that they differ at very high significance (> 6σ).

We compared observations with predictions from photoionization models (described in Sect. 4.1) to improve our understanding of the excitation properties of the narrow-line emitting gas in
AGN. We first explore diagnostic diagrams (Sect. 4.3) based on
UV emission-line ratios and these diagrams confirm the efficacy
of the C iv line to select AGN. We then perform a simple spectral
fitting to estimate the metallicity, expressed in terms of the gasphase oxygen abundance, of the emitting gas in our C iv-selected
AGN (Sect. 4.4).
4.1. Photoionization models

The nebular emission from the NLR of AGN was modeled with
single ionization-bounded gas clouds using the approach described in Feltre et al. (2016). The AGN ionizing spectrum, described as a series of broken power laws (Eq. 5 in Feltre et al.
2016), is combined with the photoionization code CLOUDY
(version c13.03, last described in Ferland et al. 2013). We included dust and radiation pressure and adopted an open geometry appropriate for gas with a small covering factor, that is, the radiation from the illuminated face of the cloud toward the source
of continuum radiation is allowed to escape without further interacting with the gas.
The models are parameterized in terms of
– the UV spectral index, α, of the incident radiation field (Fν ∝
να ) at the wavelength range of the ionizing photons;
– the volume-averaged ionization parameter hUi1 , defined as
the dimensionless ratio of the number density of H-ionizing
photons to that of hydrogen;
– the hydrogen gas density of the clouds, nH ;
– the interstellar (gas+dust phase) metallicity, Z;
– the dust-to-heavy element mass ratio, ξd ;
– the mean distance from the central source of the illuminated
face of the NLR gas distribution, rin , hereafter inner radius
of the NLR for conciseness;
1

The models here are labeled in terms of the volume-averaged ionization parameter (see equation B.6 of Panuzzo et al. 2003) instead
of the ionization parameter at the edge of the Strömgren sphere US
(equation 4 of Feltre et al. 2016). This parametrization translates into
hUi=9/4 US . Different choices for model-labelling have no impact on
the actual CLOUDY computations, for which the input parameter is the
rate of ionizing photons.

The values of these parameters that we adopted in our calculations are summarized in Table 2. Exploring different values
for the NLR inner radius, that is, the distance from the center,
means testing different scaling relations, where the AGN luminosity is linked to the inner radius of the NLR, rin , through the
2
scaling relation LAGN /rin
= 10 p erg s−1 cm−2 . For a given AGN
luminosity, the value of the index p depends only on the assumed rin value. We explored two values of rin , 90 and 300
pc, and scaled the models to an AGN accretion-disk luminosity, integrated over the wavelength range between 0.001 and
10 µm (Eq. 5 in Feltre et al. 2016), of LAGN = 1045 erg s−1 .
To compute the transmission of the radiation through the gas
cloud, we set the outer boundary of the photoionized gas distribution by stopping our calculations when the electron density
fell below 1% of the number density of atoms of neutral hydrogen or the temperature fell below 100 K. The NLR emission extent of our models covers a wide range of values; the
outer boundary of 68% of the models lies between ∼0.8 pc and
∼12 kpc, and the median value is ∼3.8 kpc. The median luminosity of the [O iii]λ5007 lines in our models is 3.6 × 1042 erg s−1 , in
agreement with the empirical values shown in Fig. 15 of StorchiBergmann et al. (2018).
4.2. Microturbulent clouds and inner radius of the NLR gas

It is worth noting that the AGN NLR model grid adopted in this
work is an improvement over Feltre et al. (2016) and includes
two new adjustable parameters: the inner radius of the NLR, rin ,
and the internal microturbulence velocity of the gas cloud, vmicr .
These additional terms have been introduced to explain the observed luminosity of the N v compared to C iv and He ii emission lines, which is commonly underestimated by photoionization models of both broad- and narrow-line emitting regions of
AGN (Davidson & Netzer 1979).
To solve the problem of high N v/C iv and N v/He ii ratios
observed in AGN, some authors appeal to super-solar metallicities (e.g., Hamann & Ferland 1993; Shemmer & Netzer 2002;
Nagao et al. 2006), up to 10 times solar (see also Sec. 7.1.2 of
Netzer 2013). However, these same high-metallicity models do
not reproduce other ratios observed in the spectra of the same
sources (Nagao et al. 2006; Feltre et al. 2016), such as C iv/He ii
and C iii]/He ii, which instead favored lower metal abundances.
Other solutions have been proposed in the literature, such as
"selectively" enhanced nitrogen abundance (Hamann & Ferland
1992, 1993) and internally microturbulent clouds (Bottorff et al.
2000; Kraemer et al. 2007). We did not consider models with an
overabundance of nitrogen for two reasons: first, photoionization models agree well with the observed emission from other
nitrogen ions, such as N iv] (observed in this sample), without requiring an enhanced fraction of nitrogen or highly supersolar metallicity. Second, we have computed models in which

the nitrogen abundance was increased by 0.15 dex compared to
that used in Feltre et al. (2016) and found no significant improvement in reproducing the observed line ratios involving N v. We
note that our models already account for the secondary nucleosynthesis production of nitrogen (equation 11 of Gutkin et al.
2016) that results from the CNO cycle of stars that are already
enriched in carbon and oxygen and are therefore important at
high metallicities (e.g., Cowley 1995; Chiappini et al. 2003).
As an alternative to exotic metal abundances, we computed
models with a dissipative turbulence (vmicr = 100 km s−1 ) internal to the clouds that converts the turbulent motion into heat,
following the approach of Kraemer et al. (2007). The consequent increase of the electron temperature affects the emissivity
of some emission lines, and in particular, that of the collisionally excited lines. This hypothesis is further supported because
the FWHM of the N v line is wider than other high-ionization
emission lines that are observed in the type 2 composite spectrum (see Table 1), although the poor resolution of the VIMOS
spectra, the partial blending with the Lyα, and the doublet nature of the N v line mean that the line width difference cannot be
used to constrain the microturbulence models. We also explored
different scaling relations between the AGN luminosity and the
distance of the inner face of the NLR gas clouds from the central
source, that is, models with different values of the inner radius of
the NLR emitting gas (rin = 90, 300 pc) for LAGN = 1045 erg s−1 .
A lower inner radius at fixed AGN luminosity translates into an
increase in radiation pressure at the inner face of the gas cloud

4.3. Diagnostic diagrams

We compared the emission-line measurements (Sect. 3.1) of the
C iv-selected type 2 AGN with predictions from the photoionization models described above. Figure 5 shows four diagnostic diagrams based on UV emission-line ratios, which we found
to be good diagnostics of nuclear activity versus star formation
(see Sect. 4 of Feltre et al. 2016, and references therein). The
C iv/He ii versus C iv/C iii] and C iii]/He ii diagrams, originally
investigated by Villar-Martin et al. (1997), are shown in the two
top panels of Fig. 5 (left and right, respectively), while the two
bottom panels show C iv/He ii versus N v/C iv and N v/He ii (left
and right, respectively). These line ratios are used in the literature as diagnostics of the ionizing source and to investigate the
gas metallicity of type 2 AGN and z∼2.5 radio galaxies (e.g.,
De Breuck et al. 2000; Vernet et al. 2001; Groves et al. 2004b;
Nagao et al. 2006; Humphrey et al. 2008).
The purple and orange shaded areas in each panel of
Fig. 5 indicate AGN photoionization models encompassing wide
ranges of model parameters: power-law index, α, ionization parameter, hUi, gas metallicity, Z, hydrogen gas density nH , and
dust-to-metal mass ratio ξd , as summarized in Table 2. Models with no internal microturbulence and an inner radius of 300
pc as in Feltre et al. (2016) are shown in purple, while models
with internal microturbulence (vmicr = 100 km s−1 ) and smaller
inner radius (rin = 90 pc) are plotted in orange. For comparison,
the cyan stars indicate models of nebular emission from starforming galaxies by Gutkin et al. (2016). AGN models, in particular those with internally microturbulent clouds and a small
inner radius, predict line ratios similar to those measured in the
spectra of our C iv-selected sample. Reducing the inner radius
and adding the microturbulence has a similar impact on the predictions of emission-line ratios and, specifically, lead to the increase in C iv/He ii and N v/He ii ratios.

microturbulence velocity and an inner radius of 300 pc and models with microturbulence velocity vmicr = 100 km s−1 and an inner radius of 90 pc,
respectively. Cyan stars show the predictions from photoionization models of star-forming galaxies of Gutkin et al. (2016). In each panel, the gray
arrows indicate the effect of correcting the AGN data by dust attenuation for a galactic attenuation curve (Cardelli et al. 1989) and AV = 1 mag.

Only a few C iv-selected objects do not lie in the area occupied by pure AGN models in the diagnostic diagrams; in particular, four objects appear to be outliers with respect to pure
AGN models in all the diagnostic diagrams. Two of the four outliers show SEDs with an AGN contribution to the rest-frame K
band (see Sect. 3.2) that is lower than 10% and very low C iv
EWs (<10 Å), suggesting a non-negligible contribution from
star-formation activity to the emission lines of these sources.
This suggestion is supported by a blue continuum with strong
absorption lines in their VIMOS spectra. The other two outliers
present noisy spectra with a possible contribution from the broad
component to the C iii] emission line. This contribution might
artificially increase the C iii]/He ii line ratio. The moderate S/N
of the VIMOS spectra did not allow us to perform a multiple
fitting (broad, narrow, and stellar components) of the emission
lines, but we are confident that both the C iv-selection and the
removal of the broad-line objects through FWHM thresholding
provided us with a relatively clean sample of narrow-line AGN.
We also studied diagnostic diagrams based on the EW of C iii]
and C iv lines, namely EW(C iii]) versus C iii]/He ii (EW−C3)
and EW(C iv) versus C iv/He ii (EW−C4). None of the sources is
classified as a star-forming galaxy when the separation criteria
of Hirschmann et al. (2018) are adopted. Of the 64 objects that
are covered by the C iii] line, 8 lie in the composite region (i.e.,
intermediate between pure AGN and pure star-forming galaxy)
of the EW−C3 diagram, while 15 of the C iv-selected AGN lie
in the composite region of EW−C4 (see table 1 and figure 5 of
Hirschmann et al. 2018). All the sources except for one are classified as AGN following the separation criteria of Nakajima et al.
(2018). This object is one of the two outliers that show a significant contribution from a stellar component in the spectra. That
the diagnostic diagrams contain only a few outliers suggests that
contaminations from the BLR and/or from the star formation (the
two main sources of uncertainty in the analysis of the UV emisArticle number, page 8 of 14

sion lines) probably do not significantly affect the measurements
of the narrow-line fluxes.
4.4. Physical properties of the nebular gas

To study the excitation properties of our C iv-selected type 2
sample, we compared predictions from the photoionization models (Sect. 4) to the observations by fitting emission-line ratios. In
particular, we considered ratios of any possible combination of
the emission lines measured in the spectra of our C iv-selected
type 2 AGN, namely N v, N iv], He ii, [O iii], C iv, C iii], C ii],
and [Ne iv]. We adopted a galactic attenuation curve (Cardelli
et al. 1989) for consistency with the fitting procedure that was
used to derive the stellar masses of the host galaxy (Sect. 3.2).
The C iv-selected type 2 sample is ideal to study the excitation properties of the AGN NLR. The simultaneous presence
of two or more emission lines of ions such as oxygen, nitrogen,
and/or carbon in the same spectra, along with the plethora of the
other UV lines available, provides strong constraints on the photoionization models. We computed the likelihood of each model
given the data by adopting a simple Bayesian approach, similarly to Vidal-García et al. (2017, see their eq. 3), where our
sets of observables are emission-line ratios instead of spectral
indices. We then computed the median values of the posterior
distribution functions and corresponding errors (computed using
the 16th and 84th percentile) of the parameters of the models
(see Sect. 4 and Table 2).
The line fluxes of our C iv-selected AGN are compatible
with a wide range of the volume-averaged ionization parameter, −2.8 < log hUi < −0.65, and interstellar metallicities,
0.002 . Z . 0.05, (0.1 . Z/Z . 3.3), with median values of 1.65 and 0.008 (∼half solar), respectively. The present-day solar
(photospheric) metallicity adopted in the models is Z = 0.01524
(Bressan et al. 2012).

M. Mignoli et al.: Obscured AGN at 1.5 < z < 3.0 from the zCOSMOS-deep Survey

Moreover, the median UV spectral index of the ionizing radiation field for our type 2 AGN sample is α = −1.63; here, 51%
of the objects with a the median value of the posterior distribution function lie in the range −1.7 < α < −1.55. We find no
preference among the different values of hydrogen gas density,
nH and dust-to-metal mass ratio, ξd . Determining whether these
loose constraints are due to a lack of observables connected with
these parameters or to the need of a finer sampling in the models
is beyond the scope of this paper. We also find that about 85%
and 70% of our sample favor models with an inner radius of
90.0 pc for LAGN = 1045 erg s−1 and an internal microturbulence
velocity of 100 km s−1 , respectively.
From the spectral fitting we finally derive values of the gasphase oxygen abundance, expressed as 12 + log(O/H)gas , of between 7.6 < log(O/H)gas < 9.4, with median value of 7.9. This
quantity is directly linked to a photoionization model of a given
interstellar metallicity, Z, and dust-to-metal mass ratio, ξd (i.e.,
the fraction of metals depleted onto dust grains), as outlined in
Sect. 2.3.2 of Gutkin et al. (2016). For reference, the solar interstellar (dust+gas phase) and gas-phase oxygen abundances of
the models are 12 + log(O/H)=8.83 and 12 + log(O/H)gas =8.68
for Z = Z = 0.01524 and ξd = ξd = 0.36 respectively. The
implications of these results are discussed in the next section.

5. Discussion
5.1. Nebular properties of narrow-line AGN at z=1.5-3

By exploiting predictions from photoionization models, we investigated the excitation properties of the ionized gas in the NLR
of C iv-selected type 2 AGN. Several works have performed similar studies on other samples, even though those samples are
more limited in terms of number of sources and line detections.
The line ratios measured from the spectra of our C iv-selected
type 2 AGN, shown in Fig. 5, are similar to those measured from
the spectra of z∼2 radio galaxies and X-ray selected narrow-line
QSO (De Breuck et al. 2000; Vernet et al. 2001; Szokoly et al.
2004; Nagao et al. 2006; Dors et al. 2014). We review and discuss the main results from our analysis below.
Ionization parameter. Our C iv-selected AGN favor models with a relatively high volume-averaged ionization parameter (−2.8 < log hUi < −0.65, Sect. 4.4), but this is in line with
those observed in other samples of active galaxies. Nagao et al.
(2006) and Dors et al. (2014) found −2.2 < log(U0 ) < −1.4 and
−2.5 < log(U0 ) < −1.0, respectively. We note that the models
of Nagao et al. (2006) and Dors et al. (2014) are parameterized
in terms of the ionization parameter computed at the inner edge
of the gas distribution rin (U0 =U(rin ) ), the values of which are not
directly comparable with the volume-averaged ionization parameter considered here. For comparison purposes, we computed the
ionization parameter from the C iii]/C iv ratio using Eq. 1 of Dors
et al. (2014) for the 62 sources of our sample in whose spectra
the C iii] line is detected. We obtained ionization parameters at
the inner radius of the NLR in the range −2.2 < log(U0 ) < −1.0.
These values are similar to those found in previous works and
further validate our C iv-based criteria to select type 2 AGN.
Interstellar metallicity. As discussed in Sect. 4.1, high supersolar metallicities, up to ∼ 6 Z (e.g., Hamann & Ferland 1993;
Shemmer & Netzer 2002; Nagao et al. 2006), have been invoked
to explain enhanced N v emission in both BLR and NLR of
AGN. In our sample of 1.5 ≤ z ≤ 3.0 type 2 AGN we estimated
a subsolar or close to solar interstellar (gas+dust phase) metallicity for 89% of our objects. In particular, only 5 of the 54 C ivselected sources at z >1.9, the redshift at which the N v line en-

ters the VIMOS spectral coverage, have supersolar metallicity.
This result is at odds with results presented in literature and probably arises because we measured a larger number of different
emission lines and adopted a wider range of free parameters in
our model grid (i.e., inner radius and internal microturbulence),
which can explain the enhanced N v emission observed in AGN
spectra at z ∼ 2 without invoking high supersolar metallicities.
Dors et al. (2014) calibrated the C43 index (see Introduction) to derive the AGN metallicity. This quantity is based on the
strong C iii], C iv, and He ii emission lines that are observed in the
spectra of active galaxies and does not consider the N v lines. For
the 57 sources for which the C iii], C iv, and He ii lines are simultaneously present in the spectral range (excluding upper limits),
we computed the C43 index and compared it with the metallicities inferred from our fitting. Specifically, we used the "upper
branch" coefficients tabulated in Table 3 of Dors et al. (2014).
We find that the C43 indicator yields a metallicity in the range
0.1 . Z/Z . 3.0, with Z/Z > 2.5 for only 7 of 57 galaxies. We
note that the values for the metal abundances and solar metallicity adopted by Dors et al. (2014) slightly differ from those of this
work. However, despite these different assumptions, which prevent a real quantitative comparison, the ranges of Z/Z obtained
with the line fitting and the C43 method agree overall. The advantage of our model-dependent metallicity estimate is that it
employs all of the available nebular lines rather than relying on
a small subset of them, as is the case for C43.
Inner radius of the NLR. As summarized in Sect. 4.4, the
majority of the line fluxes measured in our sample favor models
with rin = 90 × (L45 )0.5 pc, where L45 is the AGN luminosity,
LAGN , expressed in units of 1045 erg s−1 . A similar relation has
also been found by Mor et al. (2009). A smaller inner radius for
a given AGN luminosity implies higher radiation pressure at the
inner edge of the cloud (Sect. 4, see also Dempsey & Zakamska
2018). This can be interpreted as UV lines originating from regions closer to the central ionizing source, where the radiation
pressure is higher for a radiation field of a given intensity. This
result confirms the wide range of ionization levels expected in
the AGN NLR, as was also shown by some studies of the restoptical lines of type 2 AGN (e.g., Richardson et al. 2014).
Internal microturbulence. The majority of the rest-frame UV
spectra of our C iv-selected type 2 AGN are better explained by
models with internally microturbulent gas. To mimic the internal
microturbulence and dissipative heating, we followed Bottorff &
Ferland (2002) (see also Kraemer et al. 2007)2 .
Our calculations were computed for a gas density of 102 <
nH < 104 cm−3 , that is, a lower density regime than was used in
the BLR models of Bottorff & Ferland (2002) and lower than the
nH = 105 cm−3 of the NLR in Kraemer et al. (2007). This implies
that the dissipative heating has a small effect on the lines of interest here, whereas a major role in strengthening the intensities
of high-ionization lines is played by photoexcitation.
The number of continuum photons that can be absorbed by
the gas before it becomes optically thick to the incident radiation is higher when the gas is internally microturbulent. These
broader absorption profiles will affect resonant transitions, such
as C iv and N v, which increases the contribution from photoexcitation. This is shown in Fig. 5, where models with internal
microturbulence have higher C iv/He ii and N v/He ii. It is worth
nothing that a smaller inner radius and internal microturbulence
affect the line ratios in a similar way, and a combination of the

Specifically, we used the Turbulence and Heat command of the
photoionization code CLOUDY for the internal microturbulence and
dissipative heating, respectively.

two (rin = 90 pc and vmicr = 100 km s−1 ) provides the highest intensities for the high-ionization C iv and N v lines. We also note
that more sophisticated methods for modeling the gas turbulence
exist, such as the use of hydrodynamical simulations (Gray &
Scannapieco 2017). To reproduce the complex physical mechanisms associated with turbulent gas is beyond the goal of this
work.
We relied on NLR properties inferred from photoionization
models and rest-UV emission lines. More reliable estimates of
metal abundances can be obtained by adding rest-optical lines
(such as [O iii]λ5007,[O iii]λ4959,[O iii]λ4363, [O ii]3727, 3729,
and the strong hydrogen recombination lines), from which we
could have direct measurements of the oxygen abundance. When
models based on both the rest-UV and rest-optical emissions are
combined, high-to-low ionization states of the NLR gas can also
be investigated, and it can be studied how these different ionization levels correlate with the radial extent of the narrow-line
emitting region. Our sample therefore represents the ideal target for near-IR spectroscopic observations, which are aimed at
complementing our set of rest-UV emission lines with the restoptical lines. A comparative study of metal abundances that are
separately derived from rest-optical and rest-UV observations
will be particularly relevant in the context of spectroscopy of
high-z AGN, for which we have to rely mainly on strong UV
lines.
5.2. Evolution with redshift of the NLR metallicity

We investigated the chemical evolution of the NLR gas with
redshift, and the results are summarized in Fig. 6, where the
gas-phase metallicity, expressed in terms of gas-phase oxygen
abundance 12+log(O/H)gas , of the C iv-selected type 2 AGN is
plotted against redshift. Despite the large scatter, our measureArticle number, page 10 of 14

ments indicate a moderate evolution of gas-phase metal content with redshift. A least-squares fit to the data (the dashed
straight line in Fig. 6) yields a decrement in the oxygen abundance of ≈0.3 dex per unity of redshift. For the sample of
90 type 2 AGN, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient is
ρ=-0.55, rejecting the hypothesis that no correlation is present
at > 99.9% confidence. We also divided our sample into three
redshift bins (z ≤ 1.9, 1.9 < z ≤ 2.6 and z > 2.6) that correspond
to different sets of emission lines used in the comparisons with
the models3 and contain 34, 33, and 23 objects, respectively. We
computed the average oxygen abundance in these three redshift
bins (black squares in Fig. 6) and obtained averaged values of
<12+log(OH)>=(8.55±0.04, 8.34±0.06, 8.16±0.04).
The decline in gas-phase oxygen abundance with increasing
redshift in the NLR of our type 2 AGN is further enforced by
the fact that the redshift bins in which the intense N v λ1240 line
is present are those with the lowest average metallicity, while
an enhanced metallicity is needed to reproduce this line with
standard photoionization models (see Sect. 4.1). Moreover, the
rate of the oxygen abundance decline that we measured is in
good agreement with the evolution of the metallicity reported by
Maiolino et al. (2008) for a sample of high-z star-forming galaxies: using their equation (2) and the average stellar mass of our
sample (2 × 1010 M ), we computed a decrement in the oxygen
abundance of 0.285 per unity of redshift in the interval between
2.2< z <3.5. This redshift range is slightly higher than but overlaps with the range considered in this work. A similar decline
(0.3 dex offset between z∼2 and z∼3.3) was observed by Onodera et al. (2016) for a sample of 41 normal star-forming galaxies. Observations of damped Lyα absorbers (DLAs) at 0< z <4.5
indicate that their metallicity decreases at a rate of ∼0.26 dex
per unit redshift (Prochaska et al. 2003). This rate of metallicity
growth observed in DLAs is similar to the rate inferred from the
observed evolution of the mass–metallicity relation (e.g., Erb et
al. 2006; Henry et al. 2013).
The SFR in galaxies ensures the production of heavy elements, whose local and global abundances in galaxies are modified by feedback processes, along with galactic winds, gas inflows, and accretion. In general, the decrease in metal content
of galaxies with increasing redshift is globally accounted for by
chemical evolultion models (e.g., Dalcanton 2007; Calura et al.
2009; Lilly et al. 2013), reproduced by semianalytical models
and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (e.g., De Lucia
et al. 2004; Ma et al. 2016; Davé et al. 2011, 2017; Torrey et
al. 2019), and observed from z∼ 0 to ∼ 3 in star-forming galaxies (e.g., Maiolino et al. 2008; Mannucci et al. 2010; Yuan et
al. 2013). There are many reasons for this observed decrease.
First of all, high-z sources are much younger and consequently
less chemically evolved than present-day galaxies. In addition,
higher z sources may still be accreting a significant fraction of
pristine gas and may host more powerful outflows that can drive
the metals outside the galaxy (e.g., Yuan et al. 2013).
To our knowledge, this is the first time that a trustworthy
metallicity evolution with redshift is observed in the NLR gas
of high-z type 2 AGN. Previous studies on rest-UV line ratios of
type 2 AGN (e.g., Nagao et al. 2006; Matsuoka et al. 2009; Dors
et al. 2014) did not show a significant evolution with redshift.
The differences between our and previous results might depend
on two main factors: first, our sample was extracted from one
single spectroscopic survey with a uniform selection technique,
At z ≤ 1.9 the N v λ1240 is still too blue for the spectral range, while
at z > 2.6 the C iii] λ1909 line moves out of the observed spectral range
(see bottom panel of Fig. 6).
3

M. Mignoli et al.: Obscured AGN at 1.5 < z < 3.0 from the zCOSMOS-deep Survey

while previous works were based on a mixed collection of local
AGN, radio galaxies, and X-ray selected type 2 AGN (see Nagao et al. 2006). Moreover, the fact that we observe a decrease
in metallicity with increasing redshift is most likely related to
the different approach in inferring the NLR gas metal content,
exploiting more complex photoionization models (i.e., including the microturbulence) to interpret multiple rest-UV emission
lines rather than using single-line ratios.
5.3. Mass-metallicity relationship in our type 2 AGN sample

After computing both the host galaxy stellar masses and NLR
gas-phase metallicities, we investigated whether the massmetallicity relationship (MZR) also held for our sample of
type 2 AGN. Figure 7 shows the mass-metallicity data for 88
C iv-selected type 2 AGN for which reliable measurements are
available4 along with the MZR at z=2.2 (red curve) and z=3.5
(purple curve) from equation (2) of Maiolino et al. (2008). The
vertical error bars in the figure represent the 1σ (68%) uncertainties resulting from the 16th and 84th percentiles of the posterior
distribution function of the gas-phase metallicity, while the horizontal lines indicate the 1σ errors on the stellar masses computed
following Bongiorno et al. (2012)5 .
Although our gas-phase metallicities are in the same range,
at least for log(M∗ ) higher than 9.5, as those computed by
Maiolino et al. (2008) for star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts, we do not find a statistically significant MZR in our data.
For the full sample of C iv-selected type 2 AGN we find in a
least-squares fitting of the data a shallow slope α=0.08 of the
relationship, and the corresponding Spearman rank correlation
coefficient cannot reject with high significance the null hypothesis of no correlation. In order to understand whether the estimates of both stellar mass and gas metallicity in the whole
type 2 AGN sample can suffer problems due to either insufficiently precise measurements or to host galaxy contamination,
we repeated the least-squares fitting to the possible MZR and
its statistical evaluation in different subsamples. In all the cases
the relationship is shallow and less statistically significant than
in the full sample. In Table 3 we show the slope and r.m.s. of
the least-squares fitting along with the correlation coefficient
for 1) the global sample; 2) the subsample with good measurements (all the emission lines detected with S/N>3 and the
SED fit with 0.5 < χ2reduced < 5); 3) the type 2 AGN detected
in the X-rays with L2−10keV >6 × 1042 erg s−1 ; 4) the sample of
type 2 AGN with intense C iv emission-line (EW0 >15Å); 5) the
sample of type 2 AGN with relatively weak C iv emission-line
(EW0 <15Å); 6) the sample of type 2 AGN with a photometry
that requires a SED fitting with an AGN dominance>1; and finally, 7) the sample of AGN with a relevant galaxy component
in the photometry, that is, AGN dominance <1. The values listed
in Table 2 show that the mass-metallicity relationship is always
extremely flat and statistically compatible with no correlation
between the two quantities. Therefore, we can safely conclude
that at least for our C iv-selected type 2 AGN sample, a strong
relationship is not observed between the NLR gas metallicity and
the stellar mass of the host galaxy.
The absence of the MZR could be ascribed to sample selection effects. By selecting powerful high-redshift AGN with
intense emission lines, such as the C iv, we culled host galax4

mass, see Sect. 3.2.

ies that may not be representative of the global star-forming
galaxy population at these redshifts. The distribution of the host
galaxy masses shown in Fig. 4 already clearly shows that the
distribution is strongly biased toward the tail with the highest
stellar masses. Moreover, our selection required a strong highionization emission line in the UV range, which might have biased our sample toward objects with a strong ionization continuum, with a massive central black hole, and with mild-to-absent
galactic extinction. All these properties may be connected more
with an evolved and massive host galaxy bulge than with a latetype galaxy rich in dust and gas.
On the other hand, Fig. 7 shows host galaxies that even if
they have stellar masses lower than 1.5 × 109 M , show an NLR
gas metallicity of 12+log(OH)gas > 8, and such values are expected for more massive galaxies. These objects, which keep the
MZR relatively flat within the mass range explored by our sample, cannot be simply explained as due to selection effects. The
MZR for star-forming galaxies has been interpreted as a consequence of the interplay between star formation efficiency, inflows of metal poor-gas, gas outflows due to galactic winds, and
consequent metal depletion (e.g., Mannucci et al. 2010). Moreover, lower mass galaxies are more metal poor because their potential well is smaller (Dayal et al. 2013). The presence of an
AGN could strengthen the potential well in the central part of the
NLR, where most of the high-ionization emission lines are emitted (in particular the UV lines; Costantini et al. 2016), reducing the metal depletion in the NLR gas across the range of host
galaxy stellar masses. Another possible explanation of the observed lack of relation between the gas-phase metallicity of the
NLR and the mass of the host is that strong AGN-driven outflows
can carry metal-rich gas from the BLR to radial distances of up to
few kiloparsec. It is well known that the metallicity of the BLR
is higher than that of the host galaxy (Xu et al. 2018; Thomas
et al. 2019) and does not seem to evolve with redshift (Warner
et al. 2003; Nagao et al. 2006). Even if the metal-rich gas in the
NLR can be supplied by massive stars from the bulge, it could
also be polluted by metals delivered by outflows emerging from
the central regions of the AGN, which enhance the metallicity
in the NLR and weaken the relationship with the stellar mass
content of the host galaxy. A connection between the two AGN
regions has also been suggested by Du et al. (2014), who found
a strong correlation between NLR and BLR metallicities for 31
low-z type 1 AGN.
The lack of MZR in our sample is at odds with the relation
recently found by Matsuoka et al. (2018) in high-z type-2 AGN.
There can be many reasons for this discrepancy, and they include differences in terms of sample selection, mass and redshift
ranges of the objects, and photoionization models. Our sample

is uniformly selected and measured from the zCOSMOS-deep
galaxy sample, while Matsuoka et al. (2018) collected mixed
spectra of previously confirmed AGN through either radio or
X-ray selection. Our C iv-selected type 2 AGN sample comprises 88 objects in a smaller redshift range compared to the
1.2 ≤ z ≤ 4.0 range of the 28 objects of the previous study.
Moreover, the stellar masses of about 40% (35/88) of the C ivselected AGN are lower than then minimum value of Matsuoka
et al. (2018), that is, log(M? ) = 10.2 M . Finally, the suite of
photo-ionization models used in this work differs from that of
Matsuoka et al. (2018) in terms of the values of gas densities,
the set of metal abundances, and the inclusion of dust physics
and metal depletion. Because the two setups of the photoionization models are so different, it is difficult to perform a quantitative comparison between the metallicity values inferred with the
two model grids.

6. Summary and conclusions
– This paper presented a sample of 192 C iv-selected AGN
in the redshift range 1.45<z<3.05, extracted from the
zCOSMOS-deep survey. Ninety of them are classified as
type 2 AGN on the basis of the FWHM of the emission lines
(Sect. 2.3).
Article number, page 12 of 14

– The average spectral properties in the rest-frame UV range
are compatible with other (brighter) optical AGN samples.
About three-quarters of the sample are detected in X-rays
based on the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy survey, but the detection rate is significantly different for the two AGN spectral classes: more than 94% of type 1 AGN are detected by
Chandra, while for the type 2 AGN, the fraction decreases
to 57%, meaning that they are likely obscured in the X-rays
(Sect. 2.5).
– We have accurately measured fluxes and widths of seven UV
emission lines in the VIMOS spectra of the type 2 AGN, and
we have exploited the large set of photometric data available in the COSMOS field to estimate the stellar masses of
their host galaxies using a two-component (AGN and galaxy)
SED-fitting technique. The host galaxy stellar masses of
the type 2 AGN are in the range 8.5×108 − 2.2×1011 M ;
the distribution is skewed toward high masses and peaks at
∼1011 M (Sect. 3.2).
– We find that the observed emission-line ratios involving the
C iv and N v emission lines can be best explained by models
with internally microturbulent clouds and an inner radius of
the NLR gas distribution of rin = 90 × (L45 )0.5 pc. All but
four (∼ 95%) of the type 2 AGN lie in the regions of the
UV-based emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams occupied

M. Mignoli et al.: Obscured AGN at 1.5 < z < 3.0 from the zCOSMOS-deep Survey

by these modified AGN photoionization models. This further
strengthens the proposed AGN selection through strong C iv
emission (Sect. 4.3).
– We have implemented a simple spectral fitting to estimate
the oxygen abundance of the NLR gas in our C iv-selected
type 2 AGN, finding subsolar or solar interstellar metallicity
for 89% of the sample (Sect. 4.4). At z > 1.9, only 5 of 54
type 2 AGN show super-solar metallicity, even though at this
redshift the N v line enters the spectral range. We explained
the observed strength of the N v emission by reducing the
inner radius of the NLR and by introducing microturbulent
clouds (see also Kraemer et al. 2007, for the latter), without
the need of invoking highly super-solar metallicities (Sect.
5.1).
– The gas-phase metallicity of the NLR in our type 2 AGN
exhibits a statistically significant evolution with redshift in
the range covered by our sample (1.5 <z <3.0). We measure
a decrement in the oxygen abundance of ≈0.3 per unity of
redshift. This value is comparable to other estimates obtained
in star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts (Sect. 5.2).
– The mass-metallicity relationship is not observed in our C ivselected sample of type 2 AGN, even when differently selected subsamples were considered (Sect. 5.3). The lack of a
statistically significant MZR could be ascribed to sample selection effects because the high-ionization C iv emission line
can cause culling of massive and dust-free hosts, which are
not representative of the star-forming galaxy population at
these redshifts. These results could also suggest that the NLR
metallicity is not a good proxy of that of the host galaxy because an AGN can affect the gas supply and metal depletion
in these regions.
We have adopted single-density ionization bounded models
of pure AGN nebular emission to interpret the observed excitation properties of the NLR emitting gas. Future works should
focus on more complex and tailored spectral decompositions accounting, in addition to the AGN component, for the contribution
of star-formation to the observed SED. Moreover, the interpretation of the physical mechanisms responsible for the enhanced
emission of the resonant N v line in AGN will strongly benefit from advanced models such as those based on hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent gas, as well as a proper treatment
of the resonant lines by means of radiative transfer through the
neutral medium. This will have relevant implications for the detection and study of potential AGN host galaxies close to the
epoch of reionization, as indicated by some tentative detections
> 7 that have been presented in the literature (e.g., Laporte et
at z ∼
al. 2017; Mainali et al. 2018). To conclude, combining the restUV emission of our sample with additional information from
rest-optical spectra from other facilities (e.g. FMOS-COSMOS;
Silverman et al. 2015) will allow us to better constrain the models and compare the physical properties inferred from the restoptical with those from rest-UV. This is particularly important
for future studies at higher redshifts with forthcoming facilities,
such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which will probe both
the rest-frame and optical UV emission of galaxies at z & 3, and
EUCLID, which will unveil the rest-UV emission of the more
luminous AGN at z & 6.
