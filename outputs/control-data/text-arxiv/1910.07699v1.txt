Heterostructure engineering provides an efficient way to obtain several unconventional phases
of LaNiO3, which is otherwise paramagnetic, metallic in bulk form. In this work, a new class
of short periodic superlattices, consisting of LaNiO3 and EuNiO3 have been grown by pulsed
laser interval deposition to investigate the effect of structural symmetry mismatch on the
electronic and magnetic behaviors. Synchrotron based soft and hard X-ray resonant scattering
experiments have found that these heterostructures undergo simultaneous electronic and
magnetic transitions. Most importantly, LaNiO3 within these artificial structures exhibits a new
antiferromagnetic, charge ordered insulating phase. This work demonstrates that emergent
properties can be obtained by engineering structural symmetry mismatch across a
heterointerface.

1. Introduction
The quest to elucidate the origin of simultaneous metal-insulator transition (MIT), charge
ordering (CO) and structural symmetry change in rare earth nickelate (RENiO3) series have
drawn significant attentions in recent times.[1,2] Another simultaneous magnetic transition in the
case of NdNiO3 and PrNiO3 adds further complexity to the problem. In contrast, LaNiO3 (LNO)
is the only member of the series which has rhombohedral structure and remains metallic down
to the lowest temperature.[3,4] Moreover, a recent report of paramagnetic to E’-type
antiferromagnetic (E’-AFM) transition in the metallic LNO single crystal has prompted active
debates and sparked reinvestigation of the magnetic nature of the ground state of LNO.[5-7] To
add further complexity, these compounds are also characterized as the negative effective charge
transfer (∆’) systems.[8-12] Interestingly, the appearance of an antiferromagnetic metallic phase
was predicted earlier by the model Hamiltonian calculations for negative ∆’ system.[13]
Additionally, such an antiferromagnetic metallic system has excellent potential for spintronics
applications.[14] These findings motivate investigation of how to create an antiferromagnetic,
charge ordered ground state in LNO. Heterostructuring of LNO has been shown to enable
several unconventional behaviors (see Refs.1,2 and references therein). For example, unlike the
negligible orbital polarization of bulk LNO, LaNiO3/LaTiO3 heterostructure exhibits strong
orbital anisotropy.[15-17] Helical spin configurations were realized in LNO through interfacial
charge transfer from La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 layers.[18] Superconductivity was also reported in
LNO/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 superlattice.[19] The reduction of LNO film thickness results in an
insulating phase due to quantum confinement effect.[20-25] A ferromagnetic phase in epitaxial
LNO film on LaAlO3 (1 1 1) substrate was also demonstrated.[26] Surprisingly, magnetic
ordering, analogous to E’-AFM phase and without any charge ordering was obtained in 2 uc of
LNO layers sandwiched between the insulating spacer LaAlO3.[23,27] Despite all these findings
and somewhat surprisingly, long-range charge ordering (CO) has not been demonstrated thus
far.

2

Apart from the above mentioned RENiO3/ABO3 (B≠Ni) heterostructures, epitaxial
growth of two different members of the RENiO3 series in a layer-by-layer way offers another
interesting route to achieve unconventional behavior.[28-30] For example, bulk EuNiO3 (ENO)
undergoes simultaneous electronic and structural transition at 410 K and a magnetic transition
around TN ~ 200 K. Surprisingly, the artificial structure in the form of [1 uc ENO/1 uc LNO]
(uc= unit cell in pseudocubic setting) superlattice (SL) grown on single crystalline NdGaO3
exhibit all four simultaneous transitions, similar to bulk NdNiO3 and PrNiO3.28 As illustrated
in Figure 1(a), each Ni in the 1ENO/1LNO SL [marked as Ni(I)] has Eu on one side and La on
the opposite side along [0 0 1]pc, implying each layer is equivalent to an ordered analog of
Eu0.5La0.5NiO3 composition.[30] On the contrary, [m uc EuNiO3/m uc LaNiO3] (mENO/mLNO)
superlattices with m >1 have additional bulk-like ENO and LNO unit cells, where each Ni has
either Eu or La on both sides (respectively marked by Ni(II) and Ni(III) in Figure 1(b)). Since
bulk ENO and LNO have a different octahedral rotational pattern a-a-c+ vs. a-a-a-, strong
structural competition between ENO and LNO layers in these [mENO/mLNO] systems can
lead to new electronic and magnetic phases.[31,32]
Here we report the development of a new LNO-based heterostructure and demonstrate
emergence of a novel charge ordered antiferromagnetic insulating phase of LNO. To avoid
complications caused by quantum confinement and/or interfacial charge transfer, we have
judiciously built a series of [m EuNiO3/m LaNiO3] X N superlattices (here N denotes the
number of repeats) using pulsed laser deposition.[28-30] While the long-periodic superlattice
(m=8) shows entirely metallic behavior, the short-periodic superlattices undergo simultaneous
metal to insulator and paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transitions. Resonant hard-X-ray
scattering experiments have revealed the signature of monoclinic symmetry and Ni resonance
features in the metallic phase of the m=5 film. The Ni resonance further increases after entering
into the insulating phase, signifying the development of charge ordering throughout the whole
superlattice. Magneto-transport measurements show a sign change in the Hall coefficient RH on
3

crossing the transition temperature in all cases, which can be explained as a consequence of
Fermi surface reconstruction. The combination of advanced experimental probes has confirmed
the successful creation of a new antiferromagnetic and charge ordered insulating phase in LNO,
which is otherwise a paramagnetic metal in the bulk form.
2. Results and Discussions
mENO/mLNO superlattices were grown on single crystalline NdGaO3 (1 1 0)or [(0 0 1)pc] (here
or and pc denote orthorhombic and pseudocubic setting) substrates using a pulsed laser
deposition system.[28-30] For each SL, the deposition on NGO substrate starts with an ENO layer
and terminates with a LNO surface layer. The sample thickness (2mN) is 36 uc for SLs with m
= 1, 3 and 30 uc for m=5 sample. The effect of tensile strain in LNO and ENO ultra-thin films
is compensated by octahedral rotations and breathing-mode distortions, resulting in a bulk-like
net out-of-plane lattice constant.[32-34] The effect of epitaxial strain of these SLs have been
investigated using synchrotron X-rays. Figure 1(c) shows representative diffraction scans along
the (0 0 l)pc truncation rod. As seen, the diffraction pattern of each SL consists of a sharp
substrate peak, a broad film peak (indicated by #) and a set of Kiessig fringes. The presence of
the satellite peaks further testifies for the intended superlattice structure of each film.
Surprisingly, the out-of-plane lattice constants of all of these SLs (cpc = 3.793 Å, 3.793 Å and
3.791 Å for m=1, 3, 5 sample, respectively) are very similar to the cpc (3.8 Å) of EuNiO3 thin
film on NGO substrate.[34] This observation clearly suggests that in these short-periodic
superlattices, the LNO layers follow the structural response of the ENO layers.
The modification in electronic behavior as a function of m has been investigated by dc
transport measurements. Using a parallel resistor model with bulk-like ENO, bulk-like LNO
and the interfacial ELNO layer, the expected resistance of the SL can be expressed as
RSL = RENORLNORELNO/(RENORLNO + RENORELNO + RLNORELNO)

(1)

Here, all NiO2 layers in mENO/mLNO SLs having EuO layers on both sides along [0 0 1]pc

4

are named as bulk-like ENO throughout the paper. Similarly, bulk-like LNO layers refer to the
NiO2 layers with LaO layers on both sides and interfacial ELNO layer refers to NiO2 layer,
having EuO in one side and LaO in other side. As expected from the equation 1, the longperiod SL (m=8) is completely metallic (see Figure 2(a)). In sharp contrast, all short periodic
SLs exhibit first order MIT as a function of temperature. The transport data of m=1 SL also
show the first order MIT of the interfacial ELNO layer (marked as Ni(I) in Fig. 1).
Unexpectedly, a large change in the layer number (e.g. m=1 → 5) within each period does not
result in any drastic change in the transition temperature (Table-1). The observation of a MIT
in the m=5 film implies that bulk-like LNO layers marked by Ni(III) in Figure 1(b) also become
insulating below TMIT ~ 120 K. Apart from the bulk LNO, the metallic phase of RENiO3 show
distinct non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior with the NFL exponent tunable by hydrostatic
pressure or by epitaxial strain.[29,35-37] To extract the value of the power exponent n, we plot
log(dRs/dT ) vs. log(T) shown in Figure 2(b), which yields n = 1.05±0.05 - the value which is
very close to n=1 for T > 175 K for the m=5 sample. Similar linear T-dependent behavior is also
observed for 1ENO/1LNO SL.[29] Interestingly, n (=1.3±0.02) is very close to 4/3 for
3ENO/3LNO SL in the range of 150 K < T <220 K but switches to unity above 240 K. Such
NFL behaviors implies that the electronic behavior of LNO in these artificial structures is very
different compared to the bulk LNO.
Next, we discuss the magnetic properties of the SLs. The insulating phase of all RENiO3
based systems host E’-AFM phase, characterized by (1/2 0 1/2)or [≡ (1/4 1/4 1/4)pc] magnetic
wave vector.[38] A reliable estimate of the magnetic transition temperature (TN) can be obtained
from resistivity analysis.[39,40] The d(lnRs)/d(1/T ) vs. T plot (Figure 2(c)) yields TN of 145 K,
115 K and 110 K for SL with m=1, 3, 5 SL, respectively. On the other hand, resonant soft Xray diffraction (RSXD) measured with the photon energy tuned to Ni L3 edge is a direct method
for the investigation of this peculiar E’-AFM phase.[27,28,30,36,41-45] Simultaneous MIT and
magnetic transition for m=1 SL has been confirmed by our earlier RSXD experiments.[28] As
5

shown in Figure 2(d), a (1/4 1/4 1/4)pc diffraction peak is also observed at 50 K in RXD of m=5
SL, which vanishes gradually with increasing T. A plot of the area under this peak as a function
of T gives TN ~ 115 ± 5 K, which is very close to the value of TN obtained from our transport
data shown in Figure 2(c). Thus, apart from the interfacial unit cells, bulk-like LNO layers also
undergo simultaneous metal-insulator and paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic transitions in these
short periodic superlattices.
The microscopic origin of the simultaneous electronic and magnetic transitions in
RENiO3 can be accounted by the hole-Fermi surface nesting driven spin-density wave (SDW)
transition.[27,42,46,47] Interestingly, previous measurements of Hall coefficient (RH) reveal that
RH is positive in the paramagnetic metallic (PM) phase and becomes negative below TN.[40] Such
observation can be explained considering nesting driven transition of a multiband system like
RENiO3. RH dominated by the contribution from large hole pockets is positive in the PM phase.
It becomes negative below the SDW transition as the hole pockets are removed by the nesting
and the remaining small electron pockets contribute to RH in the antiferromagnetic insulating
phase. Figure 3(a)-(b) show the variation of transverse resistance (Rxy) as a function of the
applied magnetic field (H) at different temperatures (measured in cooling run) for the SLs with
m=3 and m=5. As seen, from the positive slope of the curves in Figure 3(a) RH (= tdRxy/dH,
t=film thickness) is hole-like above 100 K for the m=3 sample and then becomes electron-like.
For the m=5 film, RH is also hole-like down to 120 K and is completely electron-like at 80 K.
In the intermediate temperature range around 100 K, Rxy shows non-linear behavior with H and
switches from electron- to hole-like behavior with increasing H. Such small value of Rxy
indicates that the difference in volume between electron and hole pockets is very small at that
temperature. Similar switching of RH was also observed in 1ENO/1LNO SL (not shown). The
crossover of RH in the vicinity of TMIT ~ TN strongly point towards a SDW driven origin of the
antiferromagnetic insulating (AFI) phase of these ENO/LNO superlattices.
6

After confirming the simultaneous electronic and magnetic transitions in SLs, we
investigate the issue of the highly debated charge ordering. Unlike the bulk samples, thin films
can host an insulating phase without any CO.[28,42,45,48] The conventional picture of charge
disproportionation (CD) on Ni ions (d7+d7 → d7+δ+d7-δ)[42,49-53] is also challenged by the
alternative mechanism of bond disproportion (BD) transition, specially proposed for the most
distorted members of the series.[54-58] Such BD transition (d8L+ d8L → d8+d8L2, L represents a
hole on oxygen) results in a rocksalt-type pattern with alternating NiO6 octahedra with d8,
having long-bond (LB) and d8L2 having short-bond (SB). Most importantly, the results of Xray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray scattering experiments, conventionally used to conclude
CD on Ni sublattices can be also accounted by the BD transition.[12,50-52,58-62] However, a larger
amount of BD can generate a significant amount of Ni eg charge disproportionation. For
example, double cluster calculation with a BD of δd ~ 0.2Å by Green et al. has not only obtained
unequal spin values (S ~1.0 and 0.1 on LB and SB sites, respectively),[60] but also a difference
of ~ 0.3e in the eg electronic occupancy between LB and SB sites. It is important to note that
the amount of CD, obtained experimentally, is of the same order 2δ~ 0.45e.[50] This implies BD
and CD are cooperative in nature for bulk rare-earth nickelates. On the other hand, Lee et al.
have shown that CD on Ni sublattices can be realized as a simple consequence of the SDW
transition.[46,47]
In order to investigate BD vs. CD in the weakly insulating phase of the m=5 film, we
have measured resonant X-ray scattering at Ni K edge (1s → 4p) around (0 1 1)or [≡(-1/2 1/2
1/2)pc] and (1 0 1)or [≡ (1/2 1/2 1/2)pc] reflections.[28,50-52,61] The details of the energy and
momentum dependence of these diffraction peaks are given in Ref. 63. Here we note that (-1/2
1/2 1/2)pc peak is allowed for monoclinic and forbidden for orthorhombic symmetry. On the
other hand, the (1/2 1/2 1/2)pc reflection is allowed in both monoclinic and orthorhombic phase;
both reflections are forbidden for rhombohedral symmetry. As seen in Figure 4(a), m=5 sample
exhibits a resonance feature for (-1/2 1/2 1/2)pc diffraction peak around 8.345 keV photon
7

energy at 50 K. Generally, both the resonant intensity (Ires) and the off-resonant intensity (Ioffres)
decrease with the increase of T as previously reported for the insulating phase of thick NdNiO3
film and for 1ENO/1LNO SL.[28,50,61] However, Ioffres increases strongly up to 90 K for m=5 SL
(Figure 4(b)), suggesting the existence of additional structural effects below 90 K. Interestingly,
Ires is also non-zero in the metallic phase and the line shape is very similar to the resonant line
shape observed in insulating of EuNiO3 thin film.[44] The resonance and off-resonance intensity
for the (1/2 1/2 1/2)pc diffraction peak increases up-to 90 K and shows a marked jump across
the insulator to metal transition (see Figure 4(d), (e)). The observation of both (-1/2 1/2 1/2)pc
and (1/2 1/2 1/2)pc reflections and Ni resonance in the metallic phase of the SL clearly establish
the presence of strong monoclinic distortion in the metallic phase of the m=5 SL. Moreover, the
temperature dependence of the resonance enhancement factor [√Ires -√Ioffres] for (-1/2 1/2 1/2)pc
diffraction peak (Figure 4(c)) demonstrates the onset of a charge ordering transition around 110
K.
From these experimental results, we suggest the following scenario for simultaneous
metal-insulator, CO and magnetic transitions in these SLs. As shown in Figure 1(a), m=1 SL
consists of only interfacial Ni's, having EuO on one side and LaO layers on the opposite side.
The site-centred type SDW transition (Figure 4(f)) in all of these interfacial layers can give rise
to the AFI phase with CO. Apart from the interfacial NiO2 layers, m=5 SL also contain bulklike ENO and bulk-like LNO layers. The interfacial layers and the bulk-like LNO layers remain
metallic down to 120 K and the bulk-like ENO layers are charge ordered insulator with
monoclinic symmetry, resulting in overall metallic behavior of the sample. In addition to the
interfacial layers, bulk-like LNO layers also undergo SDW transition to create the insulating
phase with antiferromagnetism and charge ordering (Figure 4(f)). Unlike the pure SDW phase
with CO obtained in LaNiO3/LaAlO3 SL through dimensionality control,[23,27,61] LaNiO3 layers
in the present study undergo SDW transition in-spite of the presence of three dimensional NiO6
8

octahedral networks, resulting in the emergent charge ordered, antiferromagnetic phase of
LaNiO3, which is unattainable in the bulk form.
3. Conclusion
To summarize, our detailed measurements including magneto-transport, hard X-ray resonant
scattering and soft X-ray resonant magnetic scattering have found simultaneous metal-insulator,
charge ordering and magnetic transitions in the [m EuNiO3/m LaNiO3] SLs. In addition, the
Hall coefficient shows crossover from hole-like to electron-like behavior across the transitions.
All of these experimental observations can be successfully accounted by the notion of Fermi
surface nesting emerging in the bulk-like LNO layers and the interfacial layer. These findings
highlight the capability of heterointerface engineering to tailor new electronic and magnetic
phases of complex oxide materials.
4. Experimental Section
The layer by layer growth of each unit cell of EuNiO3 and LaNiO3 in PLD process was
confirmed by in-situ RHEED (reflection high energy electron diffraction). The details of growth
conditions can be found in Ref. [28-30]. Sample quality was checked by X-ray diffraction using
laboratory-based X-ray diffractometer and also by a six-cycle diffractometer in 6-ID-B
beamline of Advanced Photon Source (APS) in Argonne National Laboratory. Magnetotransport properties of these samples were measured in four probe Van Der Pauw geometry
using a Quantum design PPMS (Physical Property Measurement System). The issue of charge
ordering in these thin films were investigated by resonant hard X-ray scattering experiments on
Ni K edge in 6-ID-B beam line of Advanced Photon Source. Resonant soft X-ray scattering
experiments at the Ni L3 edge were performed at beam line 4.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source
(ALS) to probe the E’-antiferromagnetic order.

We recap that the scattering intensity of (011)or and (101)or peaks are given by

I011(Q,E) ∝ [A2O,RE(Q)+2AO,RE(Q).2(∆f0Ni(E)+∆f’Ni(Q)+∆f’’Ni(E)) + 4(∆f0Ni(E)+∆f’Ni(E)+∆f’’Ni(E))2]

I101(Q,E) ∝ [B2O,RE(Q)-2BO,RE(Q).2(∆f0Ni(E)+∆f’Ni(E)+∆f’’Ni(E))+4(∆f0Ni(E)+∆f’Ni(E)+∆f’’Ni(E))2]

with ∆f0Ni(E)= [f0Ni1(E)- f0Ni2(E)], ∆f’Ni(E)= [f’Ni1(E)- f’Ni2(E)], ∆f’’Ni(E)= [f’’Ni1(E)- f’’Ni2(E)].[28]

AO,RE(Q), BO,RE(Q) represent the energy-independent Thompson scattering (TS) terms for the
RE and O sites and f0Ni(E) corresponds TS terms for the Ni sites. f’Ni(E) and f’’Ni(E) term,s
responsible for resonance behaviors, are the real and imaginary energy-dispersive correction
factors. Since f’Ni(E) and f’’Ni(E) are negligible away from the resonance, the off-resonant
intensity represents pure structural information. The energy-independent term AO,RE(Q), and
BO,RE(Q) can also result in energy dependent feature at resonance energy due to their coupling
with the energy dependent term ∆f’Ni, ∆f’’Ni. The minus sign in the last equation implies that
the resonance feature around 8.345 keV would appear as a dip for (1 0 1)or diffraction peak. We
also note that the off-resonance intensity of (1 0 1)or will be stronger compared to the (0 1 1)or
peak due to the strong structural contribution via BO,RE term in the last equation.
