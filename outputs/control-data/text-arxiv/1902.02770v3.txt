Abstract
We consider the model of random walk on dynamical percolation introduced by Peres, Stauffer and Steif in [27]. We obtain comparison results for this model for hitting and mixing times
and for the spectral-gap and log-Sobolev constant with the corresponding quantities for simple
random walk on the underlying graph G, for general graphs. When G is the torus Zdn , we recover
the results of Peres et al. and we also extend them to the critical case. We also obtain bounds
in the cases where G is a transitive graph of moderate growth and also when it is the hypercube.

Introduction

In this paper we consider the model of random walk on a dynamically evolving environment introduced in [27]. Fix a base graph G = (V, E) and let each edge e refresh at rate µ to open with
probability p and closed with probability 1 − p independently of other edges and previous states
of the same edge. Let X be a continuous time random walk that moves as follows: at rate 1 it
chooses one of its neighbours uniformly at random and only jumps there if the edge connecting the
neighbour to its current location is open. Otherwise it stays in place. We denote the state of the
full system at time t by (Xt , ηt ), where Xt ∈ V and ηt ∈ {0, 1}E with 0 representing a closed edge
and 1 an open one. We refer to ηt as the environment at time t. We emphasise that (Xt , ηt )t≥0 is
Markovian, while the location of the walker (Xt )t≥0 is not. One readily checks that πfull,p = π × πp
is the unique stationary distribution and that the process is reversible; here π is the degree biased
distribution on V , i.e. π(x) = deg(x)/(2|E|) for all x and πp is product measure of Ber(p) on the
edges. Moreover, even if the environment process {ηt }t≥0 is fixed, π is a stationary distribution for
the resulting time inhomogeneous Markov process (Xt )t≥0 .
There has been a lot of interest recently in studying these processes. The case where G = Zdn was
studied in [27, 25]. The subcritical regime seems to be fully understood [27], while the supercritical
case still poses challenges. In [3], the authors established precise mixing time results for the nonbacktracking random walk on a dynamic configuration model and in [29] the authors studied the
case where G is the complete graph. In this paper, we study mixing and hitting times for random
walk on dynamical percolation on general graphs. We develop general machinery that allows for
a comparison of these quantities with the corresponding ones for simple random walk (SRW) on

the base graph G. Recall that the simple random walk (SRW) on G = (V, E) is a Markov chain
on V with transition probabilities given by P (x, y) = 1({x, y} ∈ E)/ deg(x), where deg(x) is the
degree of x (i.e. at each step the walk picks a neighbour uniformly at random and jumps to it).
We emphasise that from now on, whenever we write SRW, we refer to simple random walk on the
(static) graph G, i.e. where all edges in E are present. Below, we shall consider its continuous-time
version with jump rate 1. We note that our upper bounds on the hitting and mixing times hold for
all µ and all p ∈ (0, 1] with no difference between the subcritical and supercritical regimes. This is
in sharp contrast to previous works.
Let P be a transition matrix with stationary distribution π. We define the total variation and L∞
mixing times as follows
tmix (ε) = min{t ≥ 0 : max P t (x, ·) − π

where the total variation and L∞ norms of a signed measure a are given by kakTV = 21 x |a(x)|
and kak∞,c = maxx |a(x)/c(x)|. We are primarily interested in the total variation and L∞ mixing
times of the full system and we denote them by

Let Px,η be the law of the full process, started from initial environment η and initial location x
for the walk. We denote the corresponding expectation by Ex,η . When p and µ are not clear from
(µ,p)
(µ,p)
context, we write Px,η and Ex,η . We write Ptx,η as a shorthand for the law of the full process at
time t, Px,η ((Xt , ηt ) = (·, ·)).
We are also interested in hitting times by the full process of the form

and f (n) & g(n). We write ≍a , .a and &a when the implied constant depends on a.

Remark 1.3. We note that the term | log (1 − p) |/µ is necessary, because the L∞ mixing time of
the environment is at least of this order. However, if we were considering the total variation mixing
time of the full system, then we would get rid of this extra term. We explain this at the end of the
proof of this theorem in Section 6.
We recall that the spectral-gap of a reversible transition matrix P (resp. generator L) is defined
as the smallest positive eigenvalue of I − P (resp. −L). Its inverse is called the relaxation-time.

Indeed, this follows by Markov’s inequality and a union bound over x.

Let G = (V, E) be an n-vertex connected graph. We say that G is vertex-transitive if the action of
its automorphism group on its vertices is transitive. Denote the volume of a ball of radius r in G by
V (r). Denote the diameter of G by γ = inf{r : V (r) ≥ n}. Following Diaconis and Saloff-Coste [7]
we say that G has (c, a)-moderate growth if V (r) ≥ cn(r/γ)a for all r. Breuillard and Tointon [6]
proved that for Cayley graphs of fixed degree, this condition is equivalent in some quantitative sense
to the simpler condition that n ≤ βγ α for some α, β > 0. Tessera and Tointon recently extended
this result to vertex-transitive graphs [30]. We note that Diaconis and Saloff-Coste [7] proved that

Denote the percolation cluster of vertex x by Kx and its edge boundary by ∂Kx . We identify the
cluster with the vertices lying in it, and denote the cardinalities of Kx and ∂Kx by |Kx | and |∂Kx |,
respectively. We also denote Mp = πp (|∂Kx ||Kx |2 ) ≤ πp (d|Kx |3 ) and Np = πp (|Kx |) (by

these quantities are independent of x), where d is the degree and where πp (f ) = η πp (η)f (η)

Theorem 1.8 (Moderate growth vertex-transitive graphs, subcritical regime). Let a, b, c ∈ R+ .
Let G = (V, E) be a connected vertex transitive graph of degree d, (c, a)-moderate growth and
diameter γ. Suppose that | log(1 − p)| ≤ γ 2 , Mp ≤ b and Np ≤ γ/8. Then

We note that the condition | log(1 − p)| ≤ γ 2 is very mild, and typically follows from either of the
two other conditions (provided b is much smaller than n). In applications γ ≫ 1 and we think of b
as a constant. In this case the conditions Np ≤ γ/8 and | log(1 − p)| ≤ γ 2 follow from the condition
Mp ≤ b. A more refined statement, with an explicit dependence on b is given in Lemma 7.1.

It is conjectured [31, p. 59] that when p = c/d for c > 1 the mixing time of the SRW on the giant
component is w.h.p. Θ(d2 ), however no polynomial in d upper bound is known for the static case.

1.1

Remarks and open problems

(1) Comparison with previous results: We are able to extend the results of Peres, Stauffer
and Steif [27] about Zdn to the more general setup of vertex-transitive graphs of moderate growth
via a simpler proof, while also eliminating the requirement that p is subcritical. Our results for the
supercritical case complement the results on Peres, Sousi and Steif [25, 26]. When µ is of order 1
our Theorem 1.8 provides better bounds, but their results are quenched and hence not directly
comparable to ours (also, the main result from [25] required p to be supercritical in a certain
quantitative way, namely that the expected size of the giant component is at least |V |/2). We note
that we give the first bounds about the mixing time in the critical case.
Biskup and Rodriguez [5] study continuous-time random walk on Zd for d ≥ 2 with random,
symmetric jump rates which are time dependent, stationary, ergodic and bounded from above, but
are not assumed to be positive. Under mild assumptions on the environment (meant to eliminate
the possibility that a certain edge has rate 0 for a long period of time) they prove a quenched
invariance principle.
We consider a particular case of this model in remark (9) below, but do so on general vertextransitive graphs (we also do not require the weights to be bounded). We consider the mixing time
of the walk co-ordinate in this model. The main difference is that while we consider the less general
(and simpler) case in which the rates of different edges are independent, we provide an upper bound
on the mixing time with an explicit dependence on the update rate of the rates.

(2) Refining (1.2): It is quite possible that for all regular and all bounded degree graphs one has
SRW
that tSRW

Whenever this is the case, (1.2) reads as

This follows from Theorem 1.2 and Remark 1.3. We note that this always holds up to a log log |V |

(3)Hitting times lower bound for subcritical p: It is reasonable to expect that for p which
is subcritical, say in the sense that the second moment M of the size of a cluster is bounded, we
full,(µ,p)
−1 term on the
&M (µp)−1 tSRW
have that thit

r.h.s. is meant to capture the dependence on p for p close to 0. Namely, for such p we expect that
full,(µ,p)
& (µp)−1 tSRW
thit
hit .)
(4) Heuristics for the (µ, p) dependence: The following heuristics explain the appearance of
the terms µ and p in our main results when the maximal degree is bounded. Informally, when p
is subcritical, viewing the walk when it moves from one cluster to another gives a new random
process with small increments, which (as a discrete-time process) we expect in many cases to have
the same order mixing time as SRW. However, as we now explain, the time between consecutive
1
steps of this process is typically of order µp
. Indeed, the walk co-ordinate of the full process is
typically at a cluster C of size O(1). Using the fact that the degree is bounded, it requires order
1
1
|C|µp = Ω( µp ) time units until an edge adjacent to C becomes open.
(5) Direct comparison of mixing times: It is natural to wonder whether stronger results of
full,(µ,p)
−1 log |V | and tfull,(µ,p),(∞) . (µp)−1 tSRW,(∞) + µ−1 | log(1 − p)|
. (µp)−1 tSRW

hold. Alas, it appears that small variants of the examples from [10, 18, 15] can be used to show
that this does not hold in general. However, if G is vertex-transitive we believe this should indeed
be the case with the implicit constant depending on the degree.
(6) Commute-times: It follows from our argument that for every x, y ∈ V the expected time it
takes the walk component of the full process to reach y from x and then return to x is at most

bounded away from 1.
(7) Extending Theorem 1.9 to self-products: The Cartesian product G1 × G2 = (V ′ , E ′ ) of
two graphs Gi = (Vi , Ei ) is defined via V ′ := V1 × V2 and
E ′ := {{(v1 , v2 ), (u1 , u2 )} : v1 = u1 ∈ V1 and v2 u2 ∈ E2 , or vice-versa}.
For a graph G = (V, E) we denote the n-fold self (Cartesian) product of G with itself by G⊗n =
(V n , E(G⊗n )). That is G⊗n = G⊗(n−1) × G = G × · · · × G. Note that the n-dim hypercube is the
n-fold self-product of the complete graph on two vertices with itself. The proof of Theorem 1.9 can
easily be extended to show that uniformly in (µ, p) ∈ (0, 1]2 , for G⊗n with G = (V, E) we have that

In fact, this can be derived as an immediate corollary from either (1.5) (in a similar fashion to the
derivation of Theorem 1.9) or from Theorem 1.6.
(8) Allowing µ > 1: We assume throughout that µ ∈ (0, 1]. Our analysis of the case µ = 1 can be
used almost verbatim to treat µ > 1, in which case terms of the form µ1 should be replaced by 1+µ
µ .

(9) Random rates model: We now discuss a certain extension of our results to a random walk
on dynamical random rates model. Let ν be some law supported on R+ . Consider the case that
each edge e is updated at rate µ and when it is updated, it is assigned a random rate re with law
ν independently. Given that the current location of the walk co-ordintae is x, and that the current
environment is η, where η(e) denotes the rate of the edge e, the walk co-ordinate moves to vertex
y at rate η(xy) for all xy ∈ E. Observe that the case that ν is Bernoulli(p) gives rise to random
walk on dynamical percolation. Let X ∼ ν.
We consider the case that the base graph G = (V, E) is vertex-transitive of degree d, that ν(0) =
1 − p, that E[X] < ∞ and that E[ea(X/E[X]) ] ≤ b for some a, b > 0. Let κ(µ) be the expected time
until the walk co-ordinate leaves the origin for the first time in the variant of the model in which
for each vertex v, at rate µ all of the rates of the edges incident to v are refreshed simultaneously,
2 |X>0]
, where C ′ (a, b) is a constant
independently according to the law ν. Let M := C ′ (a, b) dE[XE[X]
depending only on a, b, to be determined later. (Note that M implicitly depends on ν(0).)
In §6.1 we extend our analysis to this model and show that (for some appropriate C ′ (a, b) above)
the total variation mixing time of the walk co-ordinate is at most
C(a, b)d(M + µ)κ(µ ∨ M ) SRW
tspectral−profile ,
µ
where C(a, b) depends only on (a, b), and where A ∨ B := max{A, B}.
Moreover, if ν has a finite support, this is also an upper bound on the total variation mixing time
of the full process, whereas the L2 mixing time of the full process is at most

Question 1.10. Let G be an infinite connected vertex-transitive graph. Assume that initially the
environment is stationary. Let Pt (o, o) and Qt (o, o) be the return probability to the origin by the
(continuous-time) SRW and by the walk co-ordinate of the full process, respectively. Is it the case
that for some C = C(G, p, µ) ≥ 1 we have

We believe that for all d the order of the mixing time when p = pc and µ = o(1) lies strictly
between its values in the subcritical and supercritical regimes (for the same µ), and that it has
a complicated dependence on µ and d. (It is possible that the dependence on d becomes simple
once mean-field behavior kicks in.) This might seem surprising at first glance due to the lack of
exceptional times (i.e. times at which an infinite cluster exists) for critical dynamical percolation
on Zd in high dimension [14]. We wish to express our immense gratitude to Gabor Pete for relevant
discussions.
SRW (G) of a graph G = (V, E) is the first time by which every vertex v ∈ V has

cov (G) := maxv∈V Ev [τcov (G)] be its worst case expectation.
(µ,p)
We can similarly define τcov (G) to be the first time by which every vertex v ∈ V has been visited
by walk co-ordinate of the full process with parameters (µ, p) (i.e. (v, η) has been visited for some
(µ,p)
(µ,p) (µ,p)
η) and tcov (G) := max(v,η) E(v,η) tcov (G).

we have that

We comment that if G = (H, E) is a Cayley graph of an Abelian group H, then the auxiliary
process from § 3 is reversible (see Remark 3.7). In [9] the authors give a general comparison
principle for cover times (of two reversible Markov chains on the same state space, provided the
effective resistances of one chain are pairwise smaller than some constant multiple of those of the
other). Thus using our comparison of the transition probabilities between the auxiliary chain and
the SRW from Lemma 4.4 (together with Theorem 4.1 which relates this to a comparison of effective
(µ,p)
resistances), it follows from [9] that tcov (G) ≤ C(µ)
p tcov (G), by considering the cover time of G for
the auxiliary walk. We omit the details.

Overview of our approach

We believe that our approach may be relevant for other models of random walks on evolving
graphs, in situations in which the mixing time of the environment is smaller than that of the walk
co-ordinate. We first explain why we may concentrate on the case that µ = 1. Let L(µ,p) be the
infinitesimal generator of the full process with edge probability p and update rate µ. One can
readily see that if µ1 < µ2 then the corresponding rates satisfy
∀ x, x′ ∈ V, η, η ′ ∈ {0, 1}E ,

L(µ2 ,p) ((x, η), (x′ , η ′ )) ≤

′ ′
µ2
µ1 L(µ1 ,p) ((x, η), (x , η )).

Using this and some general theory we are able to transfer hitting time estimates from µ = 1 to
full,(µ,p)
.
ones for µ < 1, at a cost of a µ−1 multiplicative term and an additive term of order of tmix
As for the mixing time, we obtain an upper bound on the spectral-profile bound when µ = 1 by a
certain comparison with SRW. Again, general theory allows us to then translate this into a bound
for general µ < 1 at a cost of a µ−1 multiplicative term.
Now consider the case that µ = 1. As we now explain, we may also consider the case that η0 ∼ πp .
It is tempting to argue that it suffices to wait until every edge is updated once, which takes order
log |E| time units, and then the environment is stationary. However, since the walk co-ordinate is
dependent on the environment some difficulties arise when trying to formulate this. Using the fact
that µ = 1 we show that at some stopping time slightly larger than the first time at which each
edge is updated at least once, the environment is stationary and is independent of the position of
the walk. This explains why when bounding hitting times we may assume that η0 ∼ πp .
We define a sequence of increasing stopping times (w.r.t. an enlarged filtration) (τi : i ∈ Z+ ) such
that the following hold:
(1) ητi ∼ πp and is independent of Xτi for all i.


(2) τ0 = 0 and τi+1 − τi are i.i.d. such that E eδτ1 < ∞ for some δ > 0.

(3) Yi = Xτi is a Markov chain with the same stationary distribution as SRW. We call each such
τi a regeneration time.
By construction, we will have for all i ∈ N that all of the edges examined by the walk co-ordinate
(i.e. that the walk co-ordinate attempted to cross) at some time during (τi−1 , τi ) have been refreshed
8

since the last time in (τi−1 , τi ) at which they were examined. This, along with the assumption that
η0 ∼ πp , imply the crucial property (1) above.
While we do not believe the auxiliary chain (Yi )i∈Z+ to be reversible in general, we show that
π is its stationary distribution, and that the transition matrix Q of its additive-symmetrization
1
satisfies that Q(u, v) & p deg
u which turns out to be sufficient in order to obtain a comparison of its
hitting times (more precisely, of its commute times) and of its spectral-profile with that of SRW
(at a price of an O( p1 ) factor). To turn these into upper bounds on expected hitting times for
(Yi )i∈Z+ (rather than for its additive symmetrisation) we use the fact that the commute times for
the symmetrisation are always as large as they are for the original chain. As the chain (Yi )i∈Z+
is constructed by viewing the chain (Xt )t∈R+ at a nice sequence of stopping times, we then easily
translate hitting time bounds for Y into ones for X (for hitting times of the form Ty×{0,1}E ).
full,(1,p)

For the mixing time, we derive a comparison of the spectral profile bound tspectral−profile for the
full process with parameters (1, p) with that of SRW tSRW
spectral−profile . The comparison method is a
standard method for comparing analytic quantities that have an extremal characterization involving
the Dirichlet form, between two Markov chains. Despite the fact that the auxiliary chain may be
non-reversible, using the comparison method we are able to effortlessly compare the spectral-profiles
of SRW with that of the auxiliary chain. We wish to use the auxiliary chain as a link to relate the
SRW with the full process.
A major obstacle in doing so is that the former has state space V , while the latter V × {0, 1}V .
Unfortunately, the comparison method requires the two considered chains to have the same state
space, or at least similar state spaces (e.g., random walks on two quasi-isometric graphs might have
different state spaces, but with more effort can still be compared). We are unaware of any previous
works establishing a comparison argument between Markov chains with very different state spaces.
Our solution to this difficulty hinges on a probabilistic interpretation of the spectral profile in terms
of the rate of exponential decay of the tail of hitting times starting from the stationary distribution
of the chain, which we review in Section 5. This interpretation allows us to use the the auxiliary
chain as a link between the full process and the SRW.
For each set A ⊆ V × {0, 1}E we construct a certain set B ⊆ V such that π(B c ) . πfull,p (Ac )
and show that the rate of exponential decay of the tail of TA for the full process can be controlled
via that of TB for the aforementioned auxiliary chain Y . The set B is defined to be the set of all
vertices v ∈ V such that {w ∈ {0, 1}E : (v, w) ∈ A} has πp probability at least 1/4. Let C ≥ 1 be
some absolute constant. Let
γA := sup{a : Eπ [eaTD ] < ∞ for all D ⊂ V such that π(D c ) ≤ Cπfull,p (Ac )},
where the expectation is taken w.r.t. SRW. The connection of this quantity to the spectral-profile of
SRW is explained in Section 5. It follows from this connection that to prove Theorem 1.2 it suffices
to show that for some absolute constant c > 0 we have that Eπfull,p [exp(cpγA TA )] < ∞ (recall that
we consider µ = 1).
′

Let t = γCA p . Loosely speaking, we show that for some choice of (C, C ′ ), for all i ∈ N, the full
process started from its stationary distribution has a regeneration time during the time interval
[2it, (2i+1)t], with probability bounded from below. Moreover, at each such regeneration time, with
probability bounded from below, the full process is in A. Furthermore, this holds even conditioned
on the information gathered at the previous time intervals [2jt, (2j + 1)t], where for each such time
interval we expose if there was a regeneration time during it, and if there was one, we take the first
one and expose whether the walk is in A at that time.
9

(In the actual proof we do not restrict to one regeneration time per time interval, although we
could have done so; for technical reasons we make several other small modifications in the proof to
what is written above.)
This is achieved by treating the walk co-ordinate and the environment separately. For the walk coordinate we use the comparison method to compare the auxiliary chain with the SRW. By comparing
their spectral-profiles, and applying a certain inductive argument (which we sketch below) we are
able to show that at each time interval [2it, (2i + 1)t] the chain has probability bounded from below
to visit B, even when conditioning on the information exposed during the previous time intervals.
This gives us a sequence of visits to B at regeneration times by the walk co-ordinate, which are
separated by at least t time units.
For the environment, note that by definition, at every visit of the walk co-ordinate to B, if the
environment is distributed according to πp and independent of the walk, the full process would have
probability at least 1/4 of being in A. By property (1) above, the distribution of the environment
is indeed stationary at all regeneration times and in particular at the regeneration times at which
the walk visits B. However, (generally) if (Yi ) is a stationary Markov chain, and for each j, Dj is
an event which is determined by Yj , then given the values of the indicators of D1 , . . . , Di we no
longer have that Yi+1 has the same law as its unconditional law (i.e., its law might differ from the
invariant distribution). In particular, if at some of the previous visits to B at regeneration times we
expose if the full process is in A, this affects the law of the environment at the current regeneration
time, making it no longer stationary. It turns out that the fact that we consider a sequence of such
visits which are separated by an amount of time units which is larger than the relaxation-time of
the environment allows us to control such dependencies. We now review the general principle from
which this follows.
For a Markov chain (Wt )t∈R+ on a finite state space, reversible w.r.t. a distribution π̂, starting
from its invariant distribution, if s is a large multiple of its relaxation-time, then samples of the
chain at times 0, s, 2s, . . . are uncorrelated (e.g. [21, §12.7]). In fact, if D0 , D1 , D2 , . . . is a sequence
of sets such that inf{min{π̂(Di ), π̂(Dic )} : i ≥ 0} =: δ > 0, then as we explain below, using L2
considerations and an inductive argument, one can show that if s ≥ C1 trel log(1/δ) for some absolute
constant C1 then a.s.
E[1Wis ∈Di | (1Wjs ∈Djc : j < i)] ≥ δ/2.
Note that this statement is obvious is we replace Ctrel log(1/δ) by the δ/2 mixing time. As two
more complicated variants of this inductive argument will be used in the proof of Theorem 1.2, we
now give a sketch of the proof of this fact, in order to emphasise the main idea behind the proof.
Let µ be a distribution with kµ − π̂k2,π̂ ≤ δ. Let ξi be the indicator of Wis ∈ Di . Then for all i and
all a0 , a1 . . . ∈ {0, 1}, such that Pµ [Eℓ ] > 0 for all ℓ, where Eℓ = {ξj = aj for all j ≤ ℓ}, we have
that

and that
|Pµ (W(i+1)s ∈ Di+1 | Ei ) − π̂(Di+1 )| ≤ kPµ (W(i+1)s ∈ · | Ei ) − π̂k2,π̂ =: ̺i ≤ δ.
The induction step follows by combining the following simple observations (in proving the induction
step, first use (3) then (2) and then (1)):
10

(1) By the definition of the total-variation distance (kν − ν ′ kTV = maxD
|ν(D) − ν ′ (D)|), and the fact that 2kν − ν ′ kTV ≤ kν − ν ′ k2,π , we have
|Pµ (W(i+1)s ∈ Di+1 | Ei ) − π̂(Di+1 )| ≤ 12 ̺i .

.

To argue that at each time interval [2it, (2i + 1)t] the chain has probability bounded from below
to visit B, even when conditioning on the information exposed during the previous time intervals,
we use a more complicated version of this inductive argument sketched below, in which pγ1A and
the spectral-profile bound on the decay of the L2 distance from equilibrium play the roles of the
relaxation-time and the Poincaré inequality above, respectively.
Consider a sequence of visits to the set B by the walk co-ordinate of the full process at regeneration
times, say to vertices b1 , b2 , . . ., at times that are separated apart by t ≥ C2 time units, for some large
absolute constant C2 . At the i-th visit, if the environment is in Di := {w ∈ {0, 1}V : (bi , w) ∈ A},
then the full process visits A at that time. Let ξi be the indicator of the event that the environment
is in Di at this time.
We start with a stationary environment, since we start from the stationary distribution on the full
process, as we are seeking to show that Eπfull,p [exp(cpγA TA )] < ∞. Since t is large in terms of the
relaxation-time of the environment, which is O(1), in light of the above discussion it is intuitive
that ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . is approximately a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Making this intuition
precise turns out to be quite subtle, and is among the main technical challenges in the proof of
Theorem 1.2. Indeed, a major obstacle is the fact that the sets D1 , D2 , . . . are random and depend
on the walk co-ordinate, and thus also on the environment.

Auxiliary chain

Recall that G = (V, E) with V the set of vertices and E the set of edges. We fix an ordering of the
edges E = {e1 , e2 , . . . , en }.
For every edge ei we create an infinite number of copies denoted ei,1 , ei,2 , . . .. We emphasize that
the copies will not be considered as edges of E. We start (X0 , η0 ) ∼ π × πp . For every time t we
now define a set of “infected edges” Rt as follows: R0 = ∅ and if Rt− = A and the exponential
clock of X rings at time t, we then add to Rt the edge that X examines to cross at time t. If this
edge already exists in A, then we add its lowest numbered copy that is not in A. We next assign an
ordering to the edges in Rt using the ordering of the edges of E in the following way: assign label
1 to the edge (or copy) contained in Rt with the lowest label in the ordering of E. If both the edge
and some of its copies are contained in Rt , then we assign label 1 to the edge and then we give
the next label to the lowest numbered copy and so on. If there are only copies of that edge, then
assign label 1 to the lowest numbered copy of this edge and label 2 to the second lowest numbered
copy and so on, until we exhaust all the copies of the edge. Then we continue in the same way,
by finding the second edge (or copy of it) from E with the second lowest label and assign to it the

11

next label and so on. (We note that any ordering of Rt would work, but we choose to specify one
to make the construction clearer.)
When Rt− = A, then assign exponential clocks of rate µ to the edges of E that are not in A and we
also generate an exponential clock of rate |A|µ. When a clock of an edge in E \ A rings, refresh the
state of the edge to open with probability p and closed with probability 1 − p. If the exponential
clock of rate |A|µ rings at time t, choose an index from {1, . . . , |A|} uniformly at random and
remove the edge with this label from the set Rt− in order to obtain the set Rt . If the edge that
was chosen to be removed was an edge of E, then we also refresh its state.
With this construction (X, η) has the correct transition rates. This construction also enables us to
couple different systems by keeping their infected sets of the same size. More specifically, suppose
that (X 1 , η 1 ), . . . , (X m , η m ) are such that at time 0 they are i.i.d. and distributed according to π×πp
and take R01 = ∅, . . . , R0m = ∅. Then we couple them all together by using the same exponential
i we use the
clocks of rate 1 for the walk components and in order to remove edges from the sets Rt−
i |µ and choose the same uniform number from {1, . . . , Ri }. For
same exponential clocks of rate |Rt−
t−
i
the edges not in Rt− , we assign independent exponential clocks to the different systems. Finally,
when a clock rings (either of the walk or of an edge of the set R), the vertex to which the walk
components jump or the new states of the edges chosen are independent for the different systems.
With this coupling, indeed the sizes of the sets Rti remain equal throughout for different i’s.
We now want to consider the jump chain of the full process. This is defined to be the full process (X, η) observed at the sequence of jump times, which are the points of a Poisson process of
parameter 1 + µn.
The following lemma (whose proof follows immediately by induction on k) shows that with the
coupling described above the jump chains of the full processes are independent at every discrete
time step.
Lemma 3.1. Suppose that (Xk1 , ηk1 )k∈N , . . . , (Xkm , ηkm )k∈N start independently according to π × πp
and suppose that an adversary prescribes in advance at which discrete time steps the X or the η
coordinate will make a jump (i.e. the jumps of all of the systems occur simultaneously, and either
in all of them, the walk co-ordinate attempts a move, or in all of them the environment is updated).
When the adversary chooses the η coordinate to update, he also prescribes which edge is going to
be updated in each system (not necessarily the same edge!). At times at which the X coordinate is
chosen, where the X coordinate jumps to is independent for the different chains. At times when
the environment is chosen, the states of the chosen edges are also i.i.d. and become open with
probability p and closed with probability 1 − p. Then for all k we have that (Xk1 , ηk1 ), . . . , (Xkm , ηkm )
are independent.
Lemma 3.2. Consider a continuous time Markov chain with generator Q = eλ(P −I) for λ > 0.
Let X 1 , . . . , X m be continuous time Markov chains with generator Q which start from i.i.d. states
distributed according to the invariant distribution π. Suppose that their exponential clocks are
coupled in some way and at every discrete time step the jump chains (that evolve according to the
transition matrix P ) are independent. Then for every t we have

and this completes the proof.
Definition 3.3. We define the auxiliary chain Y starting from x0 as follows: start η0 ∼ πp and
X0 = x0 . Set R0 = ∅ and for every t consider the set of infected edges Rt as defined above. We
define the regeneration times by letting τ0 = 0 and for every i ≥ 0 we set
τi+1 = inf{t ≥ τi + Si : Rt = ∅},
where τi + Si is the first time after time τi that Rt becomes nonempty. The auxiliary chain is
defined to be the discrete time chain given by Yi = Xτi for all i.
Remark 3.4. Note that the (Si )’s are i.i.d. having the exponential distribution with parameter 1
and are independent of (Xτi )i .
Lemma 3.5. We have that (τi − τi−1 )i≥1 are i.i.d., have mean e1/µ and have exponential tails.
Moreover, the process (Xs , ηs , Rs )s is positive recurrent.
Proof. The first claim follows from the fact that |Rt | evolves as a birth and death chain with
transition rates q(i, i + 1) = 1 and q(i, i − 1) = µi.
We now prove that the chain (X, η, R) is positive recurrent. It suffices to prove that the state (x, η, ∅)
with x ∈ V and η ∈ {0, 1}E is positive recurrent. Let T be the first return time to (x, η, ∅). Consider the chain Zi = (Xτi , ητi ). This is clearly irreducible and positive recurrent, since it takes
values in a finite state space. Let TZ be the time it takes for Z to return to (x, η). Then TZ has
exponential tails and we have
E[T ] ≤

∞
X
i=1

E [(τi − τi−1 )1(TZ ≥ i)] .

Using Cauchy-Schwarz and the exponential tails of both TZ and (τi − τi−1 ) proves the result.
Lemma 3.6. The invariant distribution of Y is π.
Proof. In order to prove this result, we let (X 1 , η 1 ), . . . , (X m , η m ) be m systems started independently from stationarity and coupled in the way described above using the infected sets, so that
at every time t they are independent and their infected sets all have the same size |Rt |. Then by
Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 we get that (Xt1 , ηt1 ), . . . , (Xtm , ηtm ) are independent at every time t and are
distributed according to π × πp .
Fix x ∈ V and define

Then E[Sm (t)] = π(x) and by the strong law of large numbers we get that as m → ∞
Sm (t) → π(x) almost surely.
Using this and dominated convergence gives that as m → ∞
E[Sm (t) | |Rt | = 0] =

E [Sm (t)1(|Rt | = 0)]
E [π(x)1(|Rt | = 0)]

P(|Rt | = 0)
P(|Rt | = 0)

Using that
E [Sm (t)1(|Rt | = 0)] = P(|Rt | = 0) E[Sm (t) | |Rt | = 0]
and taking the limit as m → ∞ we now obtain


P Xt1 = x, |Rt | = 0 = P(|Rt | = 0) π(x).

(3.1)

If we now take the limit as t → ∞, then (Xt1 , ηt1 , Rt ) will converge to its invariant distribution µ,
which exists by Lemma 3.5. So we obtain
µ(x, {0, 1}E , ∅) = ν(∅)π(x),
where ν is the marginal for R of the invariant distribution µ.
In order to find the invariant distribution of Y we use the ergodic theorem. First of all it is easy to
see that Y is an irreducible Markov chain. Let b be its invariant distribution. Then by the ergodic
theorem we will have that almost surely as n → ∞

This shows that b(x) = π(x) for all x and concludes the proof.
Remark 3.7. Consider a graph G = (V, E) with the property that for all x, y ∈ V there is an
automorphism ϕ of G such that ϕ(x) = y and ϕ(y) = x. Any Cayley graph of an Abelian group
has this property. It is not hard to verify that graphs with this property satisfy that the transition
matrix of the auxiliary chain is symmetric and hence reversible w.r.t. the uniform distribution.
We end this section with a lemma on the holding probabilities for the auxiliary chain that will be
used later in the paper.
Lemma 3.8. Let Y be the auxiliary chain with parameters µ = 1 and p ∈ (0, 1). Then for all x ∈ V
we have that Paux (x, x) ≥ 1 − 2e2 p and (1 − p)/2 ≤ Paux (x, x) ≤ 1 − p2 , where Paux is the transition
matrix of Y .
Proof. The claim that (1 − p)/2 ≤ Paux (x, x) ≤ 1 − p/2 follows by considering the case that the
first edge to be examined by the walk after a regeneration time is closed (respectively, open), and
that this edge is then refreshed before the walk attempts to make further jumps.
We now prove minx Paux (x, x) ≥ 1 − 2e2 p. In fact, we show that α = minx αx ≥ 1 − 2e2 p, where αx
is the probability that after a regeneration time at x the walk does not leave x before the next
regeneration time. We first observe that after a regeneration time at x, until the walk co-ordinate
leaves x for the first time, every edge it examines is open with probability at most p. To see this,
by the strong Markov property, we may consider starting at time 0 from a stationary environment
with the walk co-ordinate at x. Finally, given that the edges e1 , . . . , ek were examined thus far,
at times t1 < · · · < tk and were all closed, the probability that ek+1 is open at time tk+1 > tk is
/ {ei+1 , . . . , ek }.
exactly p if ek+1 ∈
/ {e1 , . . . , ek } and is p(1 − eti −tk+1 ) < p if ek+1 = ei and ek+1 ∈
We now consider a birth and death chain with an additional point added to it. Its state space is
Z+ ∪ {∞}. Its transition matrix Q is given by Q(0, 1) = 1 − p = 1 − Q(0, ∞), while for i ∈ N we

easy to see that

Comparison of hitting times

In this section we prove Theorem 1.1. Before doing so, we review some results about hitting and
commute times.
Let (Yk )k∈N be an irreducible discrete time Markov chain on a finite state space Ω with transition
matrix P and stationary distribution π. For a ∈ Ω we write
Ta = inf{t ≥ 0 : Yt = a}

and

Ta+ = inf{t ≥ 1 : Yt = a}.

For distinct states a, b ∈ Ω we write Tab for the commute time between a and b (for the chain
starting at a), i.e.
Tba = inf{t > Tb : Yt = a}.
16

We write P ∗ for the time-reversal of P , i.e. it is the transition matrix given by
π(x)P ∗ (x, y) = π(y)P (y, x).
Let λ(A) be the smallest eigenvalue of QA , the generator of the chain killed upon exiting A. Writing
Q = γ(P − I) for some transition matrix P and γ > 0 and using the Perron Frobenius Theorem
we have that [1, Chapter 3]

λ(A) = min EQ (h, h) : h ∈ RΩ , khk2 = 1, supp(h) ⊆ A ,
(4.1)
where khk2 = (Eπ [|h|2 ])1/2 .

We next recall Dirichlet’s principle for effective resistance. For a proof see [1, Theorem 3.36].
Theorem 4.1. Let Y be a reversible Markov chain on a finite state space Ω with transition matrix P
and stationary distribution π. Then for all a, b ∈ Ω we have

EP (f, f ).
Ea [Tba ] f ∈RΩ : f (a)=1,f (b)=0, 0≤f ≤1
The following result is due to Doyle and Steiner [11] and was also rediscovered by Gaudillière and
Landim [12]. We include its short proof for the reader’s convenience.
Lemma 4.2. Let Y be a Markov chain on a finite state space Ω with transition matrix P and
stationary distribution π. Let P ∗ be its time reversal and S = (P + P ∗ )/2. Then for all a, b ∈ Ω
we have
ESa [Tba ] ≤ EPa [Tba ]
Proof. Let v(x) = Px (Ta < Tb ). Then using that v is harmonic off {a, b} (and that

ESa [Tba ]

,

where the inequality follows from Theorem 4.1 applied to the reversible matrix S using that v(b) = 0
and v(a) = 1.
The following is similar to [16, p. 12]. We give the proof for the sake of completeness.
Lemma 4.3. There exists a positive constant c so that for every reversible Markov chain on a
finite state space Ω with stationary distribution π, for all A ⊂ Ω we have that
max Ex [TA ] ≤ Eπ [TA ] + ctmix .
x∈Ω

Proof. We start by recalling another notion of mixing introduced by Aldous [2] in the continuous
time case, and later studied in discrete time by Lovász and Winkler [22]. We let
tstop = max inf{Ex [T ] : T randomised stopping time
x

s.t. Px (XT = y) = π(y) for all y}.

17

(4.2)

Note that for every x there is a randomised stopping time that achieves the infimum above (see [2]
and [22]). Let x ∈ Ω and let T be a stopping time such that Px (XT ∈ ·) = π(·) and Ex [T ] ≤ tstop .
Writing a+ = max{0, a} we then get
Ex [TA ] ≤ Ex [T ] + Ex [(TA − T )+ ] ≤ tstop + Eπ [TA ],
where we have used Ex [(TA − T )+ ] ≤ Ex [inf{t ≥ T : Xt ∈ A} − T ] = Eπ [TA ]. The proof is
now concluded using the result of Aldous [2] that there exists a positive constant c so that for all
reversible chains tstop ≤ ctmix .
Lemma 4.4. Consider the auxiliary chain Y from Definition 3.3 with parameters µ and p. Denote
its transition matrix by Paux,(µ,p) . Then for all x, y such that {x, y} ∈ E we have that
Paux,(µ,p) (x, y) ≥ PSRW (x, y)p

and

Proof. Start the environment at time 0 from its stationary distribution, and the walk co-ordinate
of the full process from x. Now consider the event that the first attempt of a jump of the walk
co-ordinate is to y, that the edge {x, y} is open at that time, and that before the walk attempts
to make its second jump the edge {x, y} is refreshed. The probability of this event is at least
µ
and at most Paux,(µ,p) (x, y).
PSRW (x, y)p 1+µ
Using the first inequality, the fact that the invariant distribution for the auxiliary chain is the same
as for the simple random walk on G by Lemma 3.6 and that the simple random walk is a reversible
chain, we get that for all {x, y} ∈ E
∗
Paux,(µ,p) (x, y) + Paux,(µ,p)
(x, y)

2

≥ PSRW (x, y)p

1+µ

and this concludes the proof.
We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.1.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let X0 = x, η0 = η and suppose that the infection process R starts with
all edges of G infected, i.e. |R0 | = |E|. Let τ be the first regeneration time, i.e. the first time that
the size of R becomes 0. Then for all x, η using that |Rt | evolves as a birth and death chain with
q(i, i + 1) = 1 and q(i, i − 1) = µi we get that
E[τ ] ≍µ log |E|.

(4.3)

We now claim that ητ is distributed according to πp and is independent of Xτ . Indeed, considering
for every edge examined by the walk the last time before τ that this happened proves the claim,
since edges that were not examined are distributed according to Ber(p). Therefore we obtain that

matrix of the simple random walk on G.

5

The spectral-profile

We now recall a couple of results from [13]. While some of the results below were originally stated in
the case where the infinitesimal generator L is of the form K − I, where I is the identity matrix and
K is a transition matrix of a discrete-time Markov chain (possibly with non-zero diagonal entries),
they hold for general L when the state space is finite, as we can always write L := c(K − I)
for some c > 0 and some transition matrix K, possibly with positive diagonal entries. (Namely
c = max(−L(x, x)) and K = L/c + I.) (All the quantities considered below scale linearly in c.)
Consider an irreducible continuous-time Markov chain on a finite state space Ω with infinitesimal generator L and stationary distribution π. Let Pt := etL . Recall that the time t transition probabilities are given by Pt (·, ·) and that the corresponding rates are given by L(x, y) :=
limh→0 h−1 (Ph (x, y) − 1(x = y)). Denote the infinitesimal generators of the time-reversal and
additive-symmetrization by L∗ and Ls := 12 (L + L∗ ), respectively, where L∗ is the dual operator of L in (L2 (Ω), h·, ·iπ ), whose rates are given explicitly by π(x)L∗ (x, y)
P:= π(y)L(y, x), where
hf, giπ := Eπ [f g] is the inner-product on RΩ induced by π and Eπ [h] := x∈Ω π(x)h(x) the stationary expectation of h ∈ RΩ . We say that L (and the corresponding Markov chain) is reversible
if L = L∗ . One can readily check that π is stationary also for L∗ and that Ls is reversible w.r.t. π,
as (L∗ )∗ = L.
Recall that for ε > 0 we denote the spectral profile
Λ(ε) = min{E(h, h) : h ∈ RΩ , Varπ (h) = 1, π(supp(h)) ≤ ε},

(5.1)

where supp(h) = {x ∈ Ω : h(x) 6= 0} is the support of h. We write λ = Λ(1) for the Poincaré
constant. We recall that in the reversible setting λ is equal to the spectral gap. A related notion is
Λ0 (ε) = min{E(h, h) : h ∈ RΩ , khk2 = 1, π(supp(h)) ≤ ε},

(5.2)

where for h ∈ RΩ , khk∞ = maxx∈Ω |h(x)| and khkp = (Eπ [|h|p ])1/p are the L∞ and Lp (p ∈ [1, ∞))
norms respectively. By Cauchy-Schwarz
khk21 = kh1(supp(h))k21 ≤ khk22 π(supp(h)),
and so 1 − π(supp(h)) ≤

Varπ (h)
khk22

≤ 1. Hence we get that
(1 − ε)Λ(ε) ≤ Λ0 (ε) ≤ Λ(ε).

(5.3)

As we now explain, Λ0 has a probabilistic interpretation, which we shall exploit later on. For each
A ( Ω we define LA to be the generator of the chain that is killed upon exiting A, whose rates are
given explicitly by LA (u, v) = L(u, v)1(u, v ∈ A), and define λ(A) to be the smallest eigenvalue of
−LsA = − 21 (LA + L∗A ). Under reversibility


c
λ(A) = sup c : max Ea [exp(cTA )] < ∞ = sup {c : Eπ [exp(cTAc )] < ∞} .
(5.4)
a∈A

Indeed, if B = sup{c : maxa∈A Ea [exp(cTAc )] < ∞} and C = sup{c : Eπ [exp(cTAc )] < ∞}, then by
definition C ≥ B, but as π has full support we actually have that C = B. Now, it is classical ([1,
Ch. 4] or [4, §3]) that under reversibility the law of TAc under initial distribution π is a mixture of an
atom at 0 of mass π(Ac ) and of exponential distributions whose minimal parameter is exactly λ(A).
From which we easily get that λ(A) = C.
20

Writing L = c(P − I) for some transition matrix P and c > 0 and using the Perron-Frobenius
Theorem (to argue that the minimum can be attained by some non-negative h) we also have that
(e.g. [1, Ch. 3])
λ(A) = min{E(h, h) : h ∈ RΩ , khk2 = 1, supp(h) ⊆ A}

= min{E(h, h) : h ∈ RΩ
+ , khk2 = 1, supp(h) ⊆ A},

(5.5)

and so
Λ0 (ε) = min{λ(A) : π(A) ≤ ε}.

Decay of L2 distances via the spectral-profile and the Poincaré constant

Recall that the Lp norm (w.r.t. π) of a signed measure σ is defined as
kσkp,π = kσ/πkp ,

where (σ/π)(x) = σ(x)/π(x).

In particular, for a distribution ν its L2 distance from π satisfies
kν − πk22,π = kν/π − 1k22 = Varπ (ν/π).

so by Grönwall’s lemma

This is the well-known Poincaré inequality. The ε Lp -mixing time is defined as
(p)

tmix (ε) = inf{t : max kP t (x, ·) − πkp,π ≤ ε}.

It is standard (e.g. [13] or [21, Prop. 4.15]) that for reversible Markov chains, for all x ∈ Ω and t

We shall use a variant of this where we want to bound the L2 mixing-time starting from some
initial distribution ν for which we have a decent upper bound on kν − πk2,π .

A lower bound on L2 distances in terms of small sets probabilities

Let P(Ω) be the collection of all distributions on Ω. Let A ( Ω and δ ∈ (0, 1). Let
PA,δ := {ν ∈ P(Ω) : ν(A) ≥ π(A) + δπ(Ac )}.

Note that

νA,δ := δπA + (1 − δ)π ∈ PA,δ ,

where πA (a) :=

intuitive that for a convex distance function between distributions, νA,δ is the closest distribution
to π in PA,δ .

A mixing time bound for the p-tilted hypercube

We call the hypercube {0, 1}d equipped with the product measure πp the p-tilted hypercube. The
natural dynamics associated with it is the one at which each co-ordinate is updated at rate µ and
takes the value 1 with probability p and 0 with probability 1 − p. This is precisely the evolution of

Proof of Theorem 1.2

Definition 6.1. Let A ⊂ V × {0, 1}E . For every a ∈ V we define
Env(a, A) = {η ∈ {0, 1}E : (a, η) ∈ A}.
For α ∈ [0, 1] we say that a ∈ V is (A, α)-environmentally friendly if πp (Env(a, A)) ≥ α. We denote
the collection of (A, α)-environmentally friendly vertices by A(α).
From now on we fix a set A ⊂ V × {0, 1}E with πfull,p (A) ≥ 21 and set B = A( 41 ). For every b ∈ B
d
d
let Env(b)
⊆ Env(b, A) be some set of environments such that πp (Env(b))
∈ [ 41 , 12 ]. Suppose that
η0 ∼ πp . Recall from Definition 3.3 that (τi ) is the sequence of regeneration times with τ0 = 0.
Let τbi := τinf{ℓ:Pℓ 1
=i} be the i-th regeneration time at which the walk co-ordinate is in B.
j=1

{Xτj ∈B}

We now take a subsequence defined as follows: σ1 = τb1 and inductively
σi+1 = inf{b
τj : τbj ≥ σi + κ},

where κ is a constant to be determined later. Finally we let
n

T = inf j : ησj ∈ Env(X

Lemma 6.2. Let η0 ∼ πp . Then ησ1 is independent of Xσ1 and distributed according to πp .
Proof. If an edge has not been examined by the walk during [0, σ1 ], then at time σ1 it is distributed
according to Ber(p). For the edges that were examined by the walk, considering the last time before
time σ1 that this happened we get that at time σ1 they are also distributed according to Ber(p)
independently over different edges and of the location of the walk.

Let Y be the auxiliary chain with parameters µ = 1 and p ∈ (0, 1). We take its continuous time
version, i.e. we consider the continuous time chain which stays at every vertex for an exponential
time of parameter 1 and then makes a jump according to Paux . We write (Ptaux,cts )t∈R+ for its
transition semigroup, i.e. Psaux,cts = es(Paux −I) , and define for δ > 0

Lemma 6.4. There exists δ0 ∈ (0, 1) such that for all p ∈ (0, 1) we have

p

(6.2)

Proof. We write Jt = Ptaux,cts . We first note that maxx,y∈V Jt (x, y) is non-increasing in t and
so r(δ) = inf{s ∈ R+ : maxx,y∈V Js (x, y) ≤ 1 − δ}. Now, let s = 1/p and let T1 be the first
time the continuous time auxiliary chain jumps out of x. Then T1 is exponential of parameter
1 − Paux (x, x) ≍ p by Lemma 3.8. We then get
Js (x, x) ≥ P(T1 > s) = e−s(1−Paux (x,x)) ≥ c1 .
Let T2 be an exponential random variable independent of T1 of parameter maxy (1− Paux (y, y)) ≍ p.
We then get
1 − Js (x, x) ≥ Px (T1 < s, T2 > s) ≥ c2
for a positive constant c2 . Noting that Js (x, y) ≤ 1 − Js (x, x) for x 6= y concludes the proof.
Below we write Λfull,(µ,p) , Λaux,(µ,p) and ΛSRW for the spectral profile of the full chain, the auxiliary
chain with parameters (µ, p) and the simple random walk respectively. Note that Λaux,(µ,p) is defined
with respect to the generator Paux,(µ,p) − I. We write Lµ,p for the generator of the full process with
parameters (µ, p). Finally, for A ⊂ V × {0, 1}E we write λ(µ,p) (A) for the smallest eigenvalue of the
restriction of −Lµ,p to A, as in the paragraph preceding (5.4).
Proposition 6.5. There exist positive constants M and L so that the following holds. Let A ⊂
V × {0, 1} be such that πfull,p (Ac ) ≤ 1/2, let B = A( 14 ) ⊆ V be as above, let δ0 be as in Lemma 6.4
and (Ys )s≥0 be the continuous time chain with generator Paux,(1,p) − I with p ∈ (0, 1). There exists

(6.7)

Throughout the remainder of the section we fix µ = 1. Our strategy for proving (6.7) is to find a
set B ⊆ V with π(B c ) . πfull,p (Ac ) and such that the asymptotic rate of decay of the tail of TA
can be controlled via the time spent in B by the auxiliary chain. Roughly speaking, we want to
have a set B such that every visit of the auxiliary chain to B is a visit of the full process to A with
some probability bounded away from 0. Here we are using the fact that the auxiliary chain can be
coupled with the full process by viewing it along regeneration times.
25

constant c such that

Indeed, for (σi ) and T as defined earlier

Pπfull,p (TA > t) ≤ Pπfull,p σ⌈16αt⌉ > t + Pπfull,p (T > ⌈16αt⌉) .


Now by Lemma 6.3 we have Pπfull,p (T > ⌈16αt⌉) ≤ (7/8)⌈16αt⌉ ≤ e−2αt and Pπfull,p σ⌈16αt⌉ > t ≤
Eπfull,p [e32ασ⌈16αt⌉ ]e−32αt , which by our assumption is at most e−32αt e⌈16αt⌉ ≤ e1−16αt . Therefore,


this would then imply that Eπfull,p eαTA < ∞, and hence λ(1,p) (Ac ) ≥ α.

So we now turn to prove (6.8). Recall that τi is the i-th regeneration time as in Definition 3.3. We
now consider the discrete time auxiliary chain Y . Let Ye be the continuous time version of Y , i.e.
we let N be an independent Poisson process of rate 1 and set Yet = YN (t) . We set

Λaux,(1,p) (M πfull,p (Ac ))

Hence, it suffices to show that by setting L to be sufficiently large there exists a positive constant c
such that for all x ≥ 1 and all i

P σi > xL3 Si ≤ ce−10xi .

Let (Ti ) be the stopping times from Proposition 6.5. Recall that N (t) ∼ Poisson(t) is the number
of jumps the continuous-time version of the auxiliary chain makes by time t. Hence N (Ti ) is the
number of jumps it makes by the stopping time Ti . We have generated the full process, the auxiliary
chain (Yj ), and its continuous-time version Yet := YN (t) on the same probability space (the auxiliary
chain is generated by viewing the walk co-ordinate of the full process at regenaration times, and
the continuous-time version of the auxiliary chain is generated from the auxiliary chain by using
an independent rate one Poisson process (N (t) : t ≥ 0)). Hence we can consider ρ(i) := τN (Ti ) ,
which is the time at which the N (Ti )-th regeneration time of the full process occurs. The walk
co-ordinate of the full process at time ρ(i) is YeTi . For all i we set Zi to be the time between ρ(i)
and the first time after ρ(i) that the walk X examines an edge. (Note Zi is an exponential variable
of parameter 1.) We also define
ξj = 1(N (Tj ) − N (Tj−1 ) ≥ 1, Zj ≥ κ)

and

Jℓ =

ℓ
X

ξj .

j=1

Note that the variables (ξi ) are i.i.d. and since Tj − Tj−1 ≥ 1 for all j and the two events appearing
in the definition of ξj are independent, we get that P(ξj = 1) ≥ (1 − e−1 )e−κ . Using the definitions
above we then have the following inclusions for all x and i
{σi ≥ xL3 Si} ⊆ {ρ(⌈xLi/4⌉) ≥ xL3 Si} ∪ {J⌈xLi/4⌉ < i}

{ρ(⌈xLi/4⌉) ≥ xL3 Si} ⊆ {N (T⌊xLi/4⌋ ) ≥ xL2 Si} ∪ {τ⌈xL2 Si⌉ ≥ xL3 Si}

{N (T⌊xLi/4⌋ ) ≥ xL2 Si} ⊆ {T⌈xLi/4⌉ ≥ xL2 Si/100} ∪ {N (xL2 Si/100) ≥ xL2 Si}.
(For instance, the first inclusion follows by noting that if J(j) ≥ ℓ and ρ(j) ≤ t then we must have
that σℓ ≤ t. Indeed, if J(j) ≥ ℓ then among T1 , . . . , Tj there are at least ℓ that contribute +1
towards increasing the index of σ - i.e. towards inf{k : σk ≥ ρ(j)}. If moreover ρ(j) ≤ t, then Tj is
generated in the full process at some time which is smaller or equal to t.)
26

The proof is now concluded by taking L sufficiently large and using Proposition 6.5 for the tails of
the stopping times Ti , the fact that J is the sum of i.i.d. indicators with probability bounded away
from 0, large deviations for Poisson random variables and Lemma 3.5 for the tails of (τi − τi−1 ).

Using that tSRW
spectral−profile (ε) & (log |V |/ε) for all ε ∈ (0, 1) shows that we can absorb the logarithmic
R 4/ε
terms (one of which is coming from the term 2 minv∈V π(v) rδ dδ, using minv π(v) ≥ |V |−2 , while the
other one from (6.4)) and this completes the proof.

The rest of the proof is identical to the proof of Theorem 1.2.

. By the

Let Ji be the set of edges examined by the walk during the time interval [σi−1 , σi ] and let Ei = E\Ji .
Crucially, given (Ji , Ei ), ησi−1 and the whole history σ(Xt : t ≤ σi ) we have that the law of ησi can
be described as follows:
(1) The different co-ordinates of ησi are independent;
(2) For e ∈ Ji we have that ησi (e) ∼ Bernoulli(p);
27

(3) For e ∈ Ei we have that ησi (e) ∼ Bernoulli(p) with probability 1 − e−(σi −σi−1 ) and otherwise
ησi (e) = ησi−1 (e). In other words, the restriction of the environment to Ei evolves during
[σi−1 , σi ] by updating each edge at rate 1 to be either open w.p. p or closed w.p. 1 − p.
For any sequence (xi ) with xi ∈ B for all i and all sequences (Si ) of subsets of E, define Ai =
{Xσ1 = x1 , . . . , Xσi = xi , E1 = S1 , . . . , Ei = Si }. For every subset of edges S we denote by πpS the
Bernoulli(p) product measure on S. By properties (1) and (2) above we then have
kP(ησi ∈ · | T ≥ i, Ai ) − πp k2,πp = P(ησi |Si ∈ · | T ≥ i, Ai ) − πpSi

where η|S denotes the restriction of η on the set of edges S. For every η ∈ {0, 1}Si we now let

νiη (·) = P σi − σi−1 ∈ · ησi−1 |Si = η, T ≥ i, Ai .

We note that under the conditioning above, the distribution of σi − σi−1 does not depend on
{ησi−1 |Si = η}, since Si is the set of edges that the walk does not examine during [σi−1 , σi ].
Therefore, we get for all η
νiη (·) = P(σi − σi−1 ∈ · | T ≥ i, Ai ) =: νi (·).
Using again that Si is the set of edges that the walk does not examine during [σi−1 , σi ] we get

µi (η) := P ησi−1 |Si = η T ≥ i, Ai = P ησi−1 |Si = η T ≥ i, Ai−1 .

Conditional on {T ≥ i} ∩ Ai , the distribution of ησi |Si is that of a p-tilted random walk on the
hypercube {0, 1}Si started from ησi−1 |Si and run for time σi − σi−1 . Let ηe be a continuous time ptilted random walk on {0, 1}Si . Hence, putting all things together (and recalling that σi − σi−1 ≥ κ
by construction) we obtain

which by taking κ sufficiently large can be made smaller than 1/8 and this completes the inductive
step and the proof of the lemma.
Proof of Proposition 6.5. First we claim that for all α we have that (1−α)π(A(α)c ) ≤ πfull,p (Ac ).
Indeed, πfull,p (A) ≤ π(A(α)) + απ(A(α)c ), and hence πfull,p (Ac ) ≥ (1 − α)π(A(α)c ). Since B =
A(1/4), this now gives that π(B c ) ≤ 43 πfull,p (Ac ) ≤ 23 . By increasing M by a 43 -factor, we may
replace πfull,p (Ac ) in (6.7) as well as in the statement of Proposition 6.5 by π(B c ).
We write r = r(δ0 ) with δ0 from Lemma 6.4 and we let α = min((δ0 /2), 1/4). To simplify notation
we write Λ = Λaux,(1,p) . Let κ ∈ N to be chosen later. We now define a sequence of times (tj ) by

We will now construct a sequence of random sets D0 , D1 , . . . such that B ⊆ Di for all i and if
ξi = 1(Yti ∈

P(ξi = 1 | ξ0 , . . . , ξi−1 ) ≥ α.
This will imply the assertion of the proposition by setting

i.e. Ti is the i-th time tj such that Ytj ∈

So now we turn to define the sets Di . We do this by induction. For i = 0 we set D0 = B c . For
i ≥ 1 we will define Di as a measurable function of ξ0 , . . . , ξi−1 . Since π(B c ) ≤ 2/3 and Y0 ∼ π, we
immediately get that
1
P(T1 = 0) = P(ξ0 = 1) = π(B) ≥ .
3
We note that if Y0 ∼ π, then given Y0 ∈

Y0 ∼ πB . We now consider the measures νi (·) = PπBi (Yt1 ∈ ·) for i = 0, 1, where we set B 0 = B

i ∈ {0, 1}. Let D1i be a set in
{D ⊇ B c : νi (D) ≥ δ0 /2}

(using the definition of r). We set D1 = D10 of Y0 ∈ B 0 and D1 = D11 of Y0 ∈ B 1 .

This concludes the construction of D1 . We now proceed by induction. For a ∈ {0, 1}i and j ≤ i
let a(j) ∈ {0, 1}j be the first j co-ordinates of a. Assume that for each a ∈ {0, 1}i we have defined

Adaptations for the dynamical random rates model

We now sketch the necessary adaptations to the argument required to analyze the random walk on
dynamical random rates model and derive the results mentioned in Remark (9) on page 7. Recall
the definition of the model as well as the claimed results.
Here each environment η specifies the rates of the edges, not merely whether the rate of an edge
is 0 or positive. Hence the state space of the full process is potentionally much larger than in the
setup of Thereom 1.2. As we employ the spectral-profile technique, as well as (5.4), we wish to
reduce the problem to the case that ν has finite support, and thus the state space is finite. (We
note that the spectral-profile technique extends to the case that the state space is continuous, but
in that case it requires some mild regularity. Instead of verifying the relevant regularity condition,
as well as verifying the validity of (5.4) in this setup, we simply reduce the problem to the case ν
has finite support.)
We approximate the measure ν by a sequence of measures νn of finite support, also satisfying the
assumptions on ν. We now argue that a uniform bound on the total variation mixing times of
the walk co-ordinate corresponding to the νn ’s (we will actually bound the mixing time for the
corresponding full process) implies the same bound on the total variation mixing time of the walk
co-ordinate for ν. As we now explain, this follows from a straightforward coupling argument:
Let T, δ > 0. Consider two sequences of time evolving environments (ηt )t≥0 and (ηt′ )t≥0 such that
for all t ≤ T and all e we have that |ηt (e) − ηt′ (e)| ≤ δ. Then starting from the same initial state,
the walks on these two evolving environments can be coupled so that they are equal to one another
by time T with probability at least 1 − e−T δd (we omit the details).
In our application, we can take T to be the upper bound on the total variation mixing time
corresponding to the νn ’s (which is independent of n), and so by taking n large enough, we can
32

pick δ to be arbitrarily small, and have that indeed the environments corresponding to ν and to νn
could be coupled as above (as to only differ by at most δ) by time T with probability arbitrarily
close to 1.
Denote the support of ν by S and assume it is finite. Crucially, π is a stationary distribution for
the walk for all possible environments, and the stationary distribution of the full process is given
by π × ν ⊗E .
As in the proof of Theorem 1.2 we wish to define regeneration times, and through them an auxiliary
chain, defined as the position of the walk co-ordinate at the regeneration times. We wish the law of
the environment at a regeneration time to be stationary, i.e. ν ⊗E , independently of the trajectory
of the walk co-ordinate until that time. One difficulty is that in the random rates model, when
the walk co-ordinate is at v, some information is gathered on the rates of all the edges incident
to v, and it is gathered even before the walk jumps. Thus if at most one edge is refreshed at each
update, there is always some information on the environment at times at which the walk is not at
a degree 1 vertex of G.
This motivates the following variant of the model: for all v ∈ V (independently) at rate µ all of
the edges incident to v are refreshed according to the law ν (independently). Let E and E ′ be
the Dirichlet forms corresponding to the original random walk on dynamical random rates model
(with single edge updates) and to the aforementioned variant, respectively. We argue that for all
f : V × S E 7→ R we have that
2dE(f, f ) ≥ E ′ (f, f ).
(6.21)
By (6.21), at the price of picking up a 2d factor, it suffices to consider the aforementioned variant.
Indeed the analysis below relies on the spectral-profile, which is amenable to such comparisons.
We now prove (6.21). Since transitions along the walk co-ordinate give exactly the same contribution in E(f, f ) and in E ′ (f, f ), it is enough to prove this for the Dirichlet forms corresponding
to the evolution of the environments, which by abuse of notation we also denote by E and E ′ . To
compare these Dirichlet form, we write them in a convenient form. We first need some notation.
Let e1 , . . . , ek ∈ E. Let η ∼ ν ⊗E . Let η e1 ∼ ν ⊗E be such that η(e) = η e1 (e) for all e 6= e1 and η(e1 )
and η e1 (e1 ) are independent. Likewise, let η e1 e2 ∼ ν ⊗E be such that η e1 (e) = η e1 e2 (e) for all e 6= e2
and η e1 (e2 ) and η e1 e2 (e2 ) are independent. We define η e1 ···ei analogously (in terms of η e1 ···ei−1 ) by
induction. For each v ∈ V let e(v1 ), . . . , e(vd ) be the edges incident to v. By the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality, for all f : S E 7→ R we have that

One adaptation to the proof of Theorem 1.2 is that instead of considering µ = 1 and comparing
2 |X>0]
, for some constant C ′ (a, b)
smaller µ’s to it, here we work with µ = M := C ′ (a, b) dE[XE[X]
depending only on (a, b) (to be chosen later), and compare smaller µ’s to it (larger values of µ can
be analyzed in the same fashion the case µ = M is treated). (Recall that a and b are the constants
from our assumption that E[ea(X/E[X] )] ≤ b, where X ∼ ν.)
33

Another difference is in the construction of the regeneration times (and thus of the auxiliary chain).
Instead of having infected edges (which are the ones on which we currently have some information
about their rate) as we did in the proof of Theorem 1.2, now we have infected vertices. We declare
v infected when the walk jumps to v, or if the walk is currently at v (if the walk jumps to an
infected vertex, the number of infected vertices does not increase). When v is picked to have the
edges incident to it refreshed, we remove v from the set of infected vertices. However, if the walk
is at v at that moment, it becomes infected again right after that time.
The (i + 1)th regeneration time denoted by τi+1 is defined inductively to be the first time t after
time τi (with the convention that τ0 = 0 and that at time 0 all vertices are infected) such that
• For some s ∈ (τi , t) we have that the walk co-ordinate at time s is at a different location than
its location at time τi ;
• The only infected vertex at time t− is the location of the walk at time t, denoted by v, and
at time t the edges indiced to v are refreshed.
(Note that right after a regeneration time, the vertex at which the walk is currently at becomes
infected again.)
By construction, it is indeed the case that at a regeneration time the law of the environment is its
stationary distribution ν ⊗E , independently of the trajectory of the walk until that time, and that
the spacings between regeneration times are i.i.d. (apart from the first regeneration time, which
has a different law).
As stated above, we fix µ = M . Recall that κ = κ(µ) is the expected time required for the walk
to leave its location after a regeneration time. By the assumption that E[ea(X/E[X]) ] ≤ b, the
1
has mean O(1) and
constant C ′ (a, b) in the definition of M can be picked as to ensure that τ2 −τ
κ
an exponentially decaying tail, and the rate of exponential decay can be bounded independently of
G and of ν. (The last fact is essential in ensuring that the constant C(a, b) in our bound on the
mixing time depends only on (a, b), but not on G and d). We omit the details.
The auxiliary chain (Yi )∞
i=0 is now defined by setting Yi to be the location of the walk at the ith
regeneration time. By symmetry, its stationary distribution is uniform (this is the only use of
transitivity). Crucially, by the definition of M it is not hard to verify that the following analog of
Lemma 4.4 holds also in the current setup (for µ ≥ M ):
∗
(x, y)
Paux,(µ,p) (x, y) + Paux,(µ,p)

2

& 1/d.

This follows by considering the case that the previous regeneration time occurred when the walk
was at vertex x, then the walk co-ordinate moved to y ∼ x, and then before the walk co-ordinate
moved away from y the following two things occurred: the edges incident to x were refreshed, and
then also the edges incident to y were refreshed. We omit the details of this calculation.
We conclude with a few technical remarks:
For A ⊂ V × S E , a ∈ V and α ∈ [0, 1] we can define Env(a, A) ⊆ RE
+ and A(α) ⊆ V as in Definition
⊗E
E
E
6.1, by replacing πp with ν
and {0, 1} by S . Crucially, because the stationary distribution
of the full process is again given by a product measure, we can again bound π(A(α)) from below,
exactly as we have in the proof of Theorem 1.2.
A key observation is that here the p-tilted hypercube {0, 1}E is replaced by a process on S E
corresponding to the evolution of the environment (in the modified model, in which at rate µ all of
34

the edges incident to a vertex are refreshed, independently). When bounding the L2 mixing time
of this chain (and then multiplying by d, as required when translating the result to the original
Cd| log minx:x6=0 ν(x)|
from (1.6). (To be precise, we pick up a
model), we pick up the additive term

Cd| log minx:x6=0 ν(x)|

term.) To obtain an upper bound on

which does not depend on minx6=0 ν(x) we use Remark 6.6.

term in the r.h.s. of (1.6), we
the total variation mixing time

Crucially, like the p-tilted hypercube of rate µ, the last Markov chain has spectral gap at least µ.
This fact is crucial in extending Lemma 6.3 to the current setup. The analog of this lemma in our
current setup is then used to relate the rate of exponential decay of the law of the hitting time of a
set A ⊂ V × S E (by the full process) to that of the set A(1/4) ⊂ V (by the auxiliary chain). This
is then used to bound the spectral profile of the full process in terms of that of SRW on G. The
details are analogous to those in the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Applications: transitive graphs of moderate growth and the
hypercube

In this section we prove Theorems 1.8 and 1.9. Below we identify a percolation cluster with the
vertices lying in it. Recall that we denote the cluster of vertex x by Kx and its edge boundary
by ∂Kx . Finally, recall that we write Mp = πp (|∂Kx ||Kx |2 ) and Np = πp (|Kx |).
Lemma 7.1. Let c, a ∈ R. There exists a positive constant c1 = c1 (a, c) such that the following holds. Let G = (V, E) be a connected vertex-transitive graph of (c, a)-moderate growth and
diameter γ. Suppose that Np ≤ γ/4. Then we have

Proof. Denote the cluster of x ∈ V w.r.t. η by Kx (η) and as usual we identify it with the set of
vertices lying in it.
P
Fix some o ∈ V . Let f (x, η) = |Kx1(η)| v∈Kx (η) dG (v, o), where dG is the graph distance w.r.t. G.
For η ∈ {0, 1}E denote by η e the environment obtained from η by setting e to be open if it was
not already open (i.e. η e (e) = 1 and η e (e′ ) = η(e′ ) for all e′ ∈ E \ {e}). Observe that the value of
f cannot change as a result of a jump in the random walk co-ordinate (as such a jump leaves the
walk in the same percolation cluster). Thus

35

Observe that for all A ⊂ V with o, x ∈ A and y ∈
/ A, given that Ko = A we have that |Ky | is
distributed as the size of the percolation cluster of y (with parameter p) on the induced graph on
V \ A, which by an obvious coupling with πp is stochastically dominated by the (unconditional) law
of |Ky | under πp . Thus for all such A we have that Eπp [|Ky |a | Ko = A] ≤ Eπp [|Ky |a ], and hence
for all a > 0 we have that
Eπp [1(y ∈

(7.2)

Plugging (7.2) in (7.1) and summing over {x, y} ∈ E yield
E(f, f ) ≤ 4µpMp .

(7.3)

We conclude the proof by showing that Varπfull,p (f ) ≥ ca,c (γ − 4Np )2 . It is not hard to verify that
X

|dG (x, o) −

Let (X, η) ∼ π × πp and (Y, η ′ ) ∼ π × πp be independent. Define
A = {dG (Y, o) ≤ γ/4,

dG (X, o) ≥ 3γ/4}.

Since G is of moderate growth, there exists a positive constant b such that P(A) ≥ b. Finally, by
the independence between X and η together with (7.4) E[f (X, η) | A] ≥ 3γ/4 − Np and similarly
we also have that E[f (Y, η) | A] ≤ γ/4 + Np , which together yield that
2Varπfull,p (f ) = E[(f (X, η) − f (Y, η ′ ))2 ] ≥ E[(f (X, η) − f (Y, η ′ ))2 1(A)]

where for the second inequality we used Jensen’s inequality and for the last one we used the
assumption that γ ≥ 4Np .
Proof of Theorem 1.8. Let P be the transition matrix of simple random walk (SRW) on G.
Diaconis and Saloff-Coste [7] showed that for a Cayley graph G of (c, a)-moderate growth we have

but as noted several times before, the general case can be reduced to the case L = c(P − I) for some
c > 0, and the relevant quantities scale linearly in c. We also note that the equivalence between
(8.1) and Theorem 1.2 in [18] relies on the general fact that if A = ∪ri=1 Ai and the sets Ai are
disjoint and satisfy L(x, y) = 0 for all x ∈ Ai and y ∈ Aj for i 6= j, then (e.g. by (5.5))
λ(A) = min λ(Ai ).

Consider now the (reducible) Markov chain on Ω := V × {0, 1}E in which the walk co-ordinate
cannot change, and the environment evolves in the usual fashion by refreshing each edge at rate µ
(and declaring it to be open with probability p and closed w.p. 1 − p). Note that it is reversible
w.r.t. πfull,p . Denote the corresponding generator by L′ while that of the (usual) full process with
parameters (µ, p) by L. Let λ′ (B) and λ(B) be the minimal Dirichlet eigenvalue of B w.r.t. L′ (i.e.,
the minimal positive eigenvalue of L′B , given by L′B (a, b) := L′ (a, b)1(a, b ∈ B)) and L, respectively.
Then by (5.5) we have that
λ′ (B) = min{EL′ (h, h) : h ∈ RΩ
+ , khk2 = 1, supp(h) ⊆ B}

≤ min{EL (h, h) : h ∈ RΩ
+ , khk2 = 1, supp(h) ⊆ B} = λ(B).

(8.4)

(The first equality holds even without irreducibility). Since w.r.t. L′ the sets ({v} × Env(v, B) :
v ∈ V ) are disconnected (i.e. L′ (a, b) = 0 for all a ∈ {v} × Env(v, B) and b ∈ {u} × Env(v, B), for
all v 6= u) and their union is B, by (8.2) we have that
λ′ (B) = min λ′ ({v} × Env(v, B)).

(8.5)

As the evolution of the chain corresponding to L′ on each set of the form {v} × {0, 1}E is simply
that of the rate µ p-tilted hypercube, for every v we have that
λ′ ({v} × Env(v, B)) = λp-tilted hypercube with rate µ (Env(v, B)).

(8.6)

As πp (Env(v, B)) ≤ δ, by (8.1) we have that for all v (uniformly in p and µ)
λp-tilted hypercube with rate µ (Env(v, B)) & ĉ log(1/δ),

(8.7)

where ĉ = ĉ(µ, p) is the log-Sobolev constant of the rate µ p-tilted hypercube (this is a dimension
free quantity [8], but here the co-ordinates of the hypercube are labeled by the set E). Finally,
combining (8.4)-(8.7) and using the facts that πfull,p (B) = δπ∗ and δ ≤ 1/M ≤ 1/2 we see that
λ(B)

where in the last inequality we have used
ĉ ≍ µ(1 − 2 min(p, 1 − p))/ log(

max(p, 1 − p)
min(p, 1 − p))

(e.g. [8], alternatively, this can be seen using the facts that (i) the log-Sobolev constant scales linearly
in µ, (ii) for product chains it is the same as the minimal log-Sobolev constant of a single co-ordinate
[8], and (iii) the log-Sobolev constant of a single co-ordinate can be approximated using (8.1)). We
max(p,1−p)

note that for p = 1/2 this should be interpreted as (1 − 2 min(p, 1 − p))/ log( min(p,1−p))

Finally, using the fact that for every reversible chain Λ(1/2) ≤ 2/trel [13, Lemma 2.2] completes
the proof.
