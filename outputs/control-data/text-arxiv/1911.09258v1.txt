Featured Application: This technique of improving the accuracy of g(2)(τ) measurement is useful
to extract higher order coherence and achieve desired laser source for quantum imaging and
secure communication.
Abstract: The second order photon correlation g(2)(τ) of a chaotic optical‐feedback semiconductor
laser is precisely measured using Hanbury Brown‐Twiss interferometer. The accurate g(2)(τ) with
non‐zero delay time is obtained experimentally from the photon pair time interval distribution
through a ninth‐order self‐convolution correction. The experimental results agrees well with the
theoretical analysis. The relative error of g(2)(τ) is no more than 5‰ within 50 ns delay time. The
bunching effect and coherence time of chaotic laser are measured via the precise photon correlation
technique. This technique provides a new tool to improve the accuracy of g(2)(τ) measurement and
boost the applications of quantum statistics and correlation.

1. Introduction
Semiconductor lasers subject to external optical feedback exhibit a rich variety of nonlinear
dynamical behaviors and are used to generate high‐dimensional chaotic laser [1,2]. This configuration
has attracted great interest for a wide range of applications, like optical chaos communication [3‐7],
secure key distribution [8], high‐speed physical random number generation [9‐12], chaos‐based optical
computing [13] and sensing [14‐16]. It is fundamentally important to understand the underlying
physical mechanisms of chaotic laser, and practically useful to improve the laser performance and
motivate its applications. Previous researches mainly focused on clarifying intensity statistics and
autocorrelation (AC) of chaotic lasers to characterize the chaotic processes [17‐21].Intensity statistics are
closely relevant to the extractible rate of random number [9,10,22] and the AC is a good indicator of
chaotic modulating bandwidth in optical chaos communications [4,19]. However, the macro‐scale
intensity statistics and AC are not sufficient to reveal all properties of a given chaotic laser, and there is
also a significant discrepancy between experimental and theoretical probability density distributions of
the laser intensity [19]. Recent researches reveal that quantum correlation is more accurate in assessing
statistical properties and more sensitive to control parameters compared to AC function [23,24].
However, the previous research is concentrated on the properties of the quantum dot laser in the
low‐intensity (low‐gain) situation, and the bunching effect of the chaotic laser, i.e., g(2)(0)> 1 at τ = 0, is
only revealed in the fully developed chaotic (high‐gain) regime. Studies on high order photon
correlation of high‐dimensional chaotic lasers are sparse, especially second order photon correlation
g(2)(τ) at non‐zero delay time.

The landmark experiment on photon correlation was first conducted by Hanbury Brown and
Twiss (HBT), demonstrating spatial second order photon correlation g(2) of a thermal light [25]. Soon
afterwards, this experiment inspired Glauber’s seminal work on quantum optics theory, which
described the photon correlation of different light fields by correlation functions within quantum statistics
[26‐28]. The photon correlation g(2) is fundamentally different from the first order correlation and is
harnessed in many applications, such as photon bunching and anti‐bunching measurement [29‐32],
spatial interference [33,34], ghost imaging [35‐37], the azimuthal HBT effect [38], single photon
detection [39], etc. The g(2)(τ) also carries a wealth of information on the statistical probability of
different photons arriving at time delay τ [40]. Up until now, there are many approaches to obtain
the photon correlation g(2)(τ), typically including two‐photon absorption (TPA) measurement [41,42],
photon coincidence counting [43], time interval measurement of photon pairs [44]. Recently, the HBT
experiment was explored to observe chaos from quantum dot lasers with external feedback [23].
However, research on photon correlation g(2)(τ) of high‐dimensional chaotic waveforms is rare and
there is still an obvious disagreement between experimental and theoretical g(2)(τ). The calculation
of g(2)(τ) from the photon pair time interval distribution provides a good way to measure the photon
correlation of pseudo‐thermal light with microsecond coherence time [44]. But For chaotic laser the
coherence time is much shorter than that of pseudo‐thermal light, and the resolution time must be
shorter than the coherence time of the laser in the measurement. Although the shorter coherence
time does not affect the bunching effect or g(2)(0) of chaotic laser [24], that makes the measurement of
g(2)(τ)(τ≠0)at very short timescales using HBT technique more difficult, owing to the limited
response time of single‐photon detectors [45]. It remains an important challenge to ravel the g(2)(τ)
(τ≠0)of the chaotic laser at a high precision, whose coherence time is below 1 ns. Accordingly, high
precision and ultrashort resolution time are required to acquire an accurate g(2)(τ) of the chaotic laser.
That is, it is potentially useful to extract higher order coherence and achieve desired laser source for
quantum imaging and secure communication.
In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally investigate the second order photon correlation
(2)
g (τ) of a chaotic optical‐feedback semiconductor laser. The g(2)(τ) is precisely measured using
self‐convolution HBT detection at tens of picoseconds resolution time. A different high order
correction of g(2)(τ) is analyzed and confirmed experimentally, which has a low relative error in wide
range of delay time. It shows a good agreement between experimental results and theoretical analysis.
We also measure the bunching effect and coherence time of chaotic laser using the precise photon
correlation technique. This technique, avoiding the photon overlapping, can give a g(2)(τ) with a high
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, the accurate measurement of g(2)(τ) for the chaotic laser has not
been investigated and reported. In view of this demonstration, we present first some highlights of
precise photon correlation measurement that are necessary for a better understanding of quantum
statistics of the chaotic laser. The demonstration well reveals photon correlation g(2)(τ) of chaotic laser
and provide a way of studying chaos with quantum optics technique.
2. High Order Correction of g(2)(τ)
Theoretically, second order photon correlation of g(2)(τ) can be obtained from an ideal photon pair
time interval distribution P1(τ).Using the self‐convolution method, one can obtain any desired high
(2)
(2)
order n, and the higher n of gn (τ) is, the more accurate gn (τ) tends to the ideal g(2)(τ). But due to the
actual operation capacity of data processing and the difficulty of convolving complex form to very
(2)
high order, we reasonably convolve gn (τ) to the ninth order but the relative error is small enough to
obtain high accuracy.
In our experiment, photon pair time interval distribution is collected by single photon counters
and the time distribution is D1(τ). Furthermore, g(2)(τ) can be calculated from the self‐convolution of
D1(τ).
The second order photon correlation g(2)(τ) have a proportional relation to G(τ),as follows:

3 of 12

G( )  Ig (2) ( ) ,

(1)

whereI is the average photon counting rate per time bin of the light field. G(τ) is the histogram of
photons at delay time τ between two photon detection events. The relation between G(τ) and P1(τ) is
given by,


G ( )  P1 ( )  P1 ( )  P1 ( )     Pn ( ) ,

(2)

n 1

where P1(τ) is an ideal photon pair time interval distribution of light field which can be obtain based
on HBT experiment, and Pn(τ) is nth order self‐convolution of P1(τ) .When P1(τ) is less than one, the
sum of Pn(τ) is convergence [40], then we can obtain
L (G ( ))
P1 ( )  L1 (

1  L (G ( ))

(3)

where L denotes the Laplace transformation, and L‐1 denotes the Inverse Laplace transformation.
When the above theory is applied to Lorentzian chaotic laser field, we can get the relation
between G(τ) and Pn(τ) of a chaotic laser. The first order correlation of Lorentzian chaotic laser is as
follows:

The relation between g(2)(τ) and g(1)(τ) of Lorentzian chaotic laser is:

Using Equations (4) and (5), we obtain:

According to Equations (1) and (6),we obtain:

The relation between g(2)(τ)and Pn(τ) is shown as follows.

(14)

Inserting Equation (7) to Equation (13) we can get different Pn(τ) . The form of Pn(τ) can be
(2)

obtained by numerical self‐convolution. The sum of Pn(τ) is G(τ), and in theory gn (τ) is comparable
(2)

to g(2)(τ)for sufficiently high n. In fact, with the increase of n, gn (τ) is closer to ideal g(2)(τ). Using
(2)

Equation (14) and increasing the order of n, we can obtain high order gn (τ). Considering the realistic
experiment condition and the data‐processing ability, the maximum order of n we take is nine. The
theoretical high order correction of g(2)(τ) is given above, which can help us to know the influences of
(2)

the experimental parameters. Here, the direct self‐convolution method is used to get gn (τ) from
experimental data. In that case, P1(τ) is related to the experimentally measured photon pair time
(2)

interval distribution D1(τ). Dn(τ) is nth order self‐convolution of D1(τ). Experimental results of gn (τ)
can be obtained from D1(τ) [44],


and the relation between G(τ) and Dn(τ) is


(16)

(2)

Thus, when we obtain the D1(τ), the high order correction gn (τ) can be deduced from the
experimental photon pair time interval distribution as follows
1 
g n(2) ( )   2 Dn ( ) .
I n 1

(17)

(2)

The above analysis basically solves the high order correction gn (τ)of the chaotic laser in theory
and experiment. One can also use this method to analyze the error caused by the variations of the
mean photon intensity and coherence time of chaotic laser. In addition, high order correction of g(2)(τ)
for coherent light can be achieved and the g(2)(τ) is perfectly equal to one.

Using the Equation (14), gn (τ) is calculated to ninth order, and higher order terms than ninth can
be omitted. Relative error δ varying with the delay time τ at the correction order of nine is calculated
as:

3. Experiment Setup
The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1, which can be used to determine time and
frequency domain of the laser characteristics and measure photon pair time interval distribution. A
1550 nm laser is generated by a distributed feedback laser diode (DFB‐LD), and a thermoelectric
temperature controller (TTC, ILX‐Light wave LDT‐5412) was used to stabilize the temperature with
an accuracy of 0.01 K. A precision current source controller (CSC, ILX‐Light wave LDC‐3412)
controlled the output intensity of the DFB‐LD laser nearby 1.5 times threshold current with a value
of 15.9 mA. The output laser passes through a polarization controller (PC) which maintains the
polarization of the feedback beam paralleling to that of the output laser. With the help of an optical
circulator (OC), the optical feedback loop can be realized. The output of the OC is connected to a
20:80 fiber coupler (FC). A total of 80% of the output light passed through the variable optical fiber
attenuator (VA1) and went back to the OC. Another output is connected with a 50:50 FC, and one
port of output was detected by a high‐speed photo detector (PD, FINISAR XPDV2120RA). Signal
time series were recorded by an oscilloscope (OSC, Lecroy LabMaster10‐36Zi) and the frequency
spectrum was obtained by a frequency spectrum analyzer (Agilent N9020A).On the same output port
of this 50:50 FC, the optical spectrum was also measured by an optical spectrum analyzer
(Yokogawa AQ6370C). The other output port of this 50:50 FC was connected with another
attenuator (VA2) followed by an HBT system, which was based on a 50:50 beam splitter (BS) with a
dual channel single photon detector(SPD, Aurea Technology LYNXEA. NTR. M2).When the
photons impinge on the SPD, the SPD delivers pulses to a time to digital converter (TDC). An
internal clock triggered two channel gates simultaneously. Then precise time information (i.e., the
time between photons arrival at different channels) was extracted via a subtractor and an integrator.
Each photon pair time interval was placed in the one‐time bin. The histogram of the photon pair
time interval distribution is obtained through cumulative measurement. The data ware read out to a
laptop computer (LC) via universal serial bus (USB) connection. When the laser beam passes from
the fiber to space or space to fiber, the fiber lens collimators are required. In Figure 1, L1, L2, L3
represents the aspheric lens collimators, and F is an optical filter used to filter out the background
noise. The chaotic laser is divided into two equal intensity beams whose intensity are measured by
the detectors SPD1 and SPD2. One can adjust the mean photon intensity of the light through the
VA2.After the above steps, the photon pair time interval distribution can be attained.

4. Experimental Results
The chaotic laser is firstly attenuated by a variable attenuator and then passes through the
HBT setup. In the photon detection system, an internal clock triggers two channel gates
simultaneously. When a photon was detected on one channel, the arriving time is recorded.
During the same clock period, a subsequent photon was received from another channel and then
the time interval was measured. The desired distribution was obtained with many records, and if
the detection quantum efficiency is higher, the better the photon pair distribution is close to the
real light source distribution. Otherwise, the single photon detector would mistake dark noise for
photon signals. Moreover, as the incident photon number increases, the noise level would be
higher due to the after pulsing effect. In that case, the time interval distribution of photon pairs is
also affected by noise. When the coherence time of light source is short, high resolution time is
required in the detection. Besides, the unbalance of the two light intensity after the BS has an
adverse effect on the acquired distribution. It was difficult to obtain an accurate time interval
distribution of photon pairs with a very low quantum efficiency. In our experiment, the detection
quantum efficiency is 25%. We investigate different average photon intensity and coherence time
affect the accuracy of different order correction. We use the relative error to compare different high
order correction with the ideal second order photon correlation. According to Equation (2), we
calculateP9(τ) with high order terms and omitted the terms higher than ninth order. Likewise, we
take photon pair time interval distribution D1(τ) and then convolve D1(τ)to D9(τ). The terms
higher than ninth order is also omitted. Using Equation (17) we obtain different high order
correction of g(2)(τ) with experiment data. The influence of different average photon intensity and
the coherence time are investigated theoretically.
At 1.5 times the threshold current (J=1.5Jth) and 25 °C temperature (T=25°C), central wavelength
was stabilized near 1548 nm. We adjust the attenuator VA1 and polarization controller to accurately
control the optical feedback strength. With the increase of the feedback strength, the laser experienced
a transition from the period‐1, period‐2, to the steady chaos oscillation. Among them, we select three
typical states, including period‐2 (weak chaos) with the feedback strength η of 2.66%, the intermediate
chaotic state (chaos) with η of 8.87%, and steady chaotic oscillation state (Strong chaos) with η of
30.31%. Figure 2a shows the three typical frequency spectrums of the chaotic laser. To quantify the
bandwidth of the chaotic laser, we used the definition that is expounded as the frequency spectrum
region the DC and the frequency where 80% of the energy is contained within [46]. According to the

7 of 12

80% bandwidth definition, the bandwidth of chaotic laser was4.98 GHz,9.84 GHz, and 11.71GHz,
respectively. Figure 2b is the optical spectrum of the chaotic laser. Environmental changes slightly
influence the optical feedback strength and the coherence length [47]. Based on the repeated
measurements we obtained the range of coherent time variation. Figure 3 is the three corresponding
time series of the chaotic laser.

Figure 3. Measured three corresponding time series of the chaotic laser. The parameters of bias current and
feedback strength are the same as those used in Figure 2.

The bandwidth of the chaotic laser is in the order of GHz and we obtained the coherence time of
chaotic laser through 3dB linewidth spectrum. Considering that the ninth order correction of the
second order photon correlation g(2)(τ) was close enough to theoretical limit, we experimentally
took the ninth order correction within 10 ns and theoretically employ the same order fitting. The
experimental photon correlation g(2)(τ) are fitted by ideal expressions, as shown in Figure 4. For
photon‐bunching chaotic light, the g(2)(τ) can be written as g(2)(τ)=1+bexp(‐2τ/τc) (b: bunching
amplitude, τc: coherence time) [23]. Figure 4 shows the experimental and theoretical fitting results for
weak chaos (b=0.479, τc=0.768 ns), chaos (b=0.524, τc=0.651 ns), and strong chaos (b=0.626, τc=0.535 ns).

5. Influences of Detector Time Resolution and High Order Omitted Terms
In our experiment, the resolution time of the detection (65 ps) was not significantly small
compared to the coherence time (~0.5 ns) of the chaotic laser, resulting in a little fluctuation of
measured g(2)(τ). In Figure 5(a), the experimental results of g(2)
n (τ) within 100 ns delay time is shown
and the magenta curve represent the original photon pair time interval distribution. The original
experimental data is the same as those used in Fig 4b. The bottom‐up colored curves indicate the
increasing order corrections of second order photon correlation. The orange curve indicate is the third order
correction of g(2)(τ), and the others are fifth, seventh, ninth order correction of g(2)(τ). For an accurate
[39].

measurement of photon correlation, a very low photon flux rate I was required to ensure

The courting rate of the SPD was controlled below 0.3 Mcounts/s by using the VA2 and the overall
detection efficiency was 25%. In figure 5a, the counting rate was 270 kcounts/s and the dead time of
the SPD was 4 us. Within 100 ns sampling time (I.e., τ=100ns), the incident light intensity was
estimated to be about

6. Relative Error of gn (τ)With Mean Photon Intensity and Coherence Time of Chaotic Laser
The coherence time of our experiment is below 1 ns and we can set the maximum
coherence time in the theoretical analysis. Following this g(2)(τ) is obtained by using
Equation (6), which is independent on the mean photon intensity. Furthermore, according to
Equation (18), it is found that the mean photon intensity and coherence time have effects on the
relative error. The maximum photon intensity in our experiment is not exceed 0.05 photons/ns.
Given this finding, we changed the mean photon intensity from 0.03 photons/ns to 0.05 photons/ns.
For the low order correction of g(2)(τ), it cannot provide sufficient information and accuracy
according to Equation (2). For the ninth order correction, there was almost no difference between g
(2)

(2)

(τ) and g(2)(τ) and the loss information can be ignored. Figure 6 shows relative error of g9 (τ)for

photon intensity changes form 0.03 photons/ns to 0.05 photons/ns and different delay times with
the ninth order correction. The relative error varied with the photon intensity and delay time. When
the delay time is shorter than 40ns the relative error can be ignored, while the relative error is
increased when the delay time is close to 100 ns. It should be noted that higher order correction can
reduce the relative error for longer delay time. In Figure6, it is also indicated that larger photon

9 of 12

intensity brings bigger error. But when the photon intensity is too low, the photon pair time interval
distribution contains a lot of dark noise that deteriorates the detection performance.

Figure 6. The relative error varying with the photon intensity and delay time. The coherence time is set as1ns.

Following this, we theoretically analyzed the coherence time from 0.3 ns to 0.7 ns under the
condition that the photon intensity is near 4×107 photon/sec. Figure 7 shows the relative error as
functions of the coherence time τc and the delay time τ. The coherence time τc varies from 0.3 ns
to 0.7 ns and the delay time τ is within 100 ns. In this case, corresponding to our experimental
condition, the relative error is not exceed 5‰ within 50 ns delay time. It is worth noting that long
τc leads to big relative error, but the change of relative error is subtle. The relative error caused by
the coherence time is smaller than that of the photon intensity.

Figure 7. Relative error as functions of coherence time and delay time. The photon intensity is 0.04 photons/sec and
the yellow dashed line corresponds to the experimental condition.

We compare the relative error caused by the above two factors (photon intensity and
coherence time).The yellow dashed line in Figure 7 indicates the case that the coherence time is
0.5 ns, which corresponds to the experiment condition. For the same delay time, the relative error
caused by coherence time was lower than that caused by photon intensity. Thus, high accuracy g(2)(τ)
requires well controlling the photon intensity [24].
From the above discussion, the high order correction of second order photon correlation was
affected by the variations of the mean photon intensity and coherence time of the laser, and we
analyzed the relative error caused by the two factors respectively. The relative error from incident
photon intensity was larger than that from coherence time. In Figure 7, the dashed line on the error
surface was under the condition that the intensity was 0.04 photons/ns and τc was 0.5 ns, which
corresponds to the experimental condition. In our experiment, the maximum relative error in ninth

10 of 12

order correction of g(2)(τ) does not exceed 5‰ within 50 ns delay time. The relative errors caused by
the photon intensity and coherence time retained the uncertainty ±0.01 photon/ns and±0.2 ns
respectively, and the overall error within 50 ns delay time did not exceed 1% in our condition.
8. Conclusions
In conclusion, we precisely measured the second order photon correlation g(2)(τ) of a chaotic
semiconductor laser using self‐convolution HBT interferometer. Based on the theoretical analysis,
the ninth order self‐convolution correction was sufficient to obtain experimentally the accurate g(2)(τ)
from the photon pair time interval distribution. The experimental results were in good agreement
with the theory. The relative error caused by coherence time and mean photon intensity was
analyzed, which was no more than 5‰ within 50 ns delay time. In comparison with the traditional HBT
measurement, this technique, which does not require high intensity and long optical or electric
delay, is more useful for a weak light source, such as atomic fluorescence and single photon
emission, whose quantum correlation is difficult to be detected. It is demonstrated that this
technique provides a new way to measure high order quantum coherence precisely and will bridge
the gap between nonlinear optics of chaotic lasers and quantum physics.
