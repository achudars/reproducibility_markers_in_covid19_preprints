Preface
There has been tremendous progress in the performance of optical frequency standards since
the early proposals to carry out precision spectroscopy on trapped, single ions (Dehmelt, 1973,
1982). The estimated fractional frequency uncertainty of today’s leading optical standards is
currently in the 10−18 range, approximately two orders of magnitude better than that of the best
caesium-fountain microwave primary frequency standards. Due to this progress, the International
Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended four optical clock transitions as
secondary representations of the second in 2006 (CIPM, 2006). Currently, there are eight optical
secondary representations (Riehle et al., 2018; BIPM, 2019) and, ultimately, this development is
expected to lead to a redefinition of the second based on some optical transition(s) (Gill, 2011;
Riehle, 2015, 2016).
The exceptional accuracy and stability offered by optical frequency standards is resulting
in a growing number of research groups developing optical clocks. While good review papers
covering the topic already exist (see for example Ludlow et al. (2015) and references therein), more
practical guidelines are needed as a complement. The purpose of this document is therefore to
provide technical guidance for researchers starting in the field of optical clocks. The target audience
includes national metrology institutes (NMIs) wanting to set up optical clocks (or subsystems
thereof) and PhD students and postdocs entering the field. Another potential audience is academic
groups with experience in atomic physics and atom or ion trapping, but with less experience of time
and frequency metrology and optical clock requirements.
These guidelines have arisen from the scope of the EMPIR project “Optical clocks with
1 × 10−18 uncertainty” (OC18). Therefore, the examples are from European laboratories even
though similar work is carried out all over the world.
The goal of OC18 was to push the development of optical clocks by improving each of the
necessary subsystems: ultrastable lasers, transfer of frequency stability from the laser to the atoms,
atom/ion traps and interrogation techniques. This document shares the knowledge acquired by the
OC18 project consortium and gives practical guidance on each of these aspects in the following
chapters.

Ultrastable lasers are a key component in optical atomic clocks. They serve as the interrogation
laser for atomic clock transitions and largely determine the stability of the clocks. However, the
coherence time of today’s most stable lasers is on the order of a few seconds, which is still an
order of magnitude lower than the coherence time of optical clock transitions in neutral atoms or
ions. Thus, the frequency fluctuations of the lasers still limit the resolved linewidth of the clock
transitions and, due to the discontinuous interrogation, also affect the clock stability via the Dick
effect.
Due to these limitations, great effort has been put into the realisation of laser sources with low
frequency noise. The most common method used so far is the stabilisation of the laser frequency
to a passive high-finesse Fabry–Perot cavity. With well-designed servo electronics, the fractional
frequency instability of the laser is then identical to the fractional optical-path-length instability
of the cavity. Accordingly, any environmental perturbation, such as temperature fluctuations or
vibrations, which affects the optical path length must be largely suppressed. In Section 1.1 we
discuss the performance and limitations of this approach with room-temperature glass cavities and
show how to reach instabilities of 10−16 or below after 1 s.
The fundamental limit of the frequency instability of the stabilised laser is given by length
fluctuations due to inevitable Brownian thermal noise of the cavity components. Placing the cavity
in a cryogenic environment can largely decrease the amount of thermal noise. Section 1.2 illustrates
the performance of ultrastable lasers employing cavities made of single-crystal silicon at cryogenic
temperatures, reaching state-of-the-art instabilities of 4 × 10−17 .
In parallel, novel laser-stabilisation techniques that do not require such extreme control of the
length of a Fabry–Perot cavity are also being explored. One of these new schemes for generating
ultrastable optical frequencies uses cavity-QED systems, while another one uses spectral hole
burning in cryogenically cooled crystals. We will discuss these approaches in Sections 1.3 and 1.4,
respectively.

1.1

Room temperature glass cavities

Among the different systems presented in this chapter, ultrastable lasers obtained by stabilising
the frequency of a CW laser to a high-finesse Fabry–Perot cavity made from ultralow thermal
expansion materials, such as ULE® , are broadly used and already commercialised (Stable Laser
7

1. Ultrastable lasers for optical clocks

OC18

Systems, 2018; Menlo Systems, 2018). The important feature of these cavities is the direct relation
between the fractional frequency instability of a longitudinal cavity mode and its fractional length
instability, expressed in Equation (1.1) by the corresponding power spectral densities
Sν
SL
= 2.

ν
L

(1.1)

Here ν is the mode frequency and L the length between the cavity mirrors. For a perfect control
loop, the laser frequency instability is thus due to the cavity-length instability alone. Hence,
important work has been performed over the years to develop Fabry–Perot cavities of extremely
stable length. This section addresses the major contributions to the instability of lasers stabilised to
room-temperature glass cavities and discusses the techniques required to reach instabilities at the
level of 10−16 or below. In Figure 1.4 we will then see an example of how the different contributions
add up to the final fractional frequency instability of a laser (Keller et al., 2014).

1.1.1

Thermal noise

The fundamental limit of the length stability of a cavity is imposed by the Brownian motion of its
components. One can link the volume fluctuations of a material at equilibrium with its response to
applied mechanical forces and how the energy is dissipated within this system (Callen and Greene,
1952), thus obtaining a relation between the thermal noise of a material and its mechanical losses.
The important equations used for estimating this thermal noise and its related power spectral density
are described in Numata et al. (2004); Kessler et al. (2012a) and summarised below.
The power spectral density of the length fluctuations of a cavity can be approximated by the
sum of the contributions from its components: one spacer, two mirror substrates (“sub”) and their
coatings (“coat”),
Sx ( f ) = Sxspacer ( f ) + 2Sxsub ( f ) + 2Sxcoat ( f ).
(1.2)
The thermal noise of the mirror substrate is given by
Sxsub ( f ) =

2
4kB T 1 − σsub
√
φsub ,
π f 2 πEsub w

(1.3)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, and w the beam waist on the mirrors. For
all the equations, σi denotes the Poisson coefficient of the material i, Ei its Young’s modulus and φi
its mechanical losses.
In this section we consider only the thermal noise of a dielectric coating, given by
2 1 − 2σsub φcoat dcoat
Sxcoat ( f ) = Sxsub ( f ) √
,
π 1 − σsub φsub w

(1.4)

where dcoat is the coating thickness. Finally, the thermal noise of a cylindrical spacer of length L,
radius R and central bore radius r is given by
Sxspacer ( f ) =

4kB T
L
φspacer .
π f 2πEspacer (R2 − r2 )

(1.5)

The thermal noise therefore has a flicker-frequency behaviour, which converts to a floor in the Allan
deviation (Allan, 1966) and is given by
r
q
Sx ( f )
floor
σy = 2 ln(2) f Sy ( f ) = 2 ln(2) f 2 .
(1.6)
L
From these equations one can understand the different approaches that have been used to
reduce the thermal noise and that recently led to instabilities ≤ 1 × 10−16 . These include the use

addition we plot curves for crystalline (Alx Ga1−x As) high-reflective coatings attached to a silicon cavity.

of mixed-material cavities with mirror substrates of lower loss factor, such as fused-silica (FS)
mirror substrates on ULE spacers (Millo et al., 2009; Dawkins et al., 2010), longer cavities (Jiang
et al., 2011; Nicholson et al., 2012; Keller et al., 2014; Häfner et al., 2015), larger beams on the
cavity mirrors (D’Ambrosio, 2003; Mours et al., 2006; Amairi et al., 2013), higher-performance
crystalline coating materials (Cole et al., 2016) and materials with very low mechanical loss factor,
such as single-crystal silicon operated at cryogenic temperatures (Kessler et al., 2012a; Matei et al.,
2017; Zhang et al., 2017b) (see Section 1.2).
As an example, we plot in Figure 1.1 the calculated thermal noise for a cylindrical cavity
with 50-mm diameter and a central bore of 11 mm as a function of the cavity length for different
materials at 300 K and for silicon at cryogenic temperatures. For simplicity we have neglected the
noise contribution of the spacer arising from local deformations at the surface of the mirror contact
(Kessler et al., 2012b). This contribution becomes important, for instance, in very short cavities
where the spacer’s thermal noise can dominate the substrate and coating contributions. The mirror
coatings are dielectric (SiO2 /Ta2 O5 ) unless specified as crystalline (Alx Ga1−x As) and are centred at
1542 nm. The radius of curvature of the curved mirror is kept constant at 1 m. Such a radius could
be used for long or short cavities. One can note that even a radius of 10 m has been successfully
used for a very compact cavity (Davila-Rodriguez et al., 2017).

Finesse

Typical Fabry–Perot cavities used for ultrastable lasers requiring fractional frequency instabilities
of 10−15 or below usually exhibit high finesse on the order of a few 100 000. The finesse F of a
Fabry–Perot resonator is given by the reflectivity r of its mirrors as F ≈ π/(1 − r2 ). In the case of
the Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH) technique for locking laser frequencies to cavity modes, the error
signal can near resonance be expressed by (Black, 2001)
√
√
−8 Pc Ps −16F Pc Ps L
ε = D δ f , with D =
=
.
(1.7)
δ νc
c
Here δ f corresponds to the frequency fluctuations around resonance, Pc and Ps are, respectively,
the powers on the carrier and sideband of the phase-modulated input beam, δ νc is the full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of the cavity resonance, F is its finesse, L its length, and c the speed of
light. Hence, high-finesse resonators help to achieve high gains in the control loop. In addition,
perturbations added to the error signal, like residual amplitude modulation (Section 1.1.7), will
have a smaller effect on the control loop if the finesse is high.
Using Equation (1.7), one can express the relation between the power spectral density of
the frequency fluctuations Sδ f and that of the electric noise Sε as Sδ f = Sε /D2 . Therefore, near
resonance the frequency noise due to the electric noise of the error signal will scale with 1/F 2 .
Hence, using high-finesse cavities will relax the requirements on the noise of the electronics
involved. One drawback is that high finesses lead to high intra-cavity powers, which can lead to
thermal processes because of the mirror losses and thus to a sensitivity to fluctuations in the optical
power. Therefore, active intensity stabilisation can be required, as described in Section 1.1.6.

1.1.3

Vacuum level

A vacuum pressure fluctuation changes the index of refraction n of the residual gas and thus the
effective length L and the resonance frequency ν of the cavity as
∆n ∆L
∆ν

(1.8)

For a gas that can be approximated as an ideal gas, such as nitrogen, the fractional change in the
index of refraction for a given pressure change ∆P in mbar at 30 ◦C can be given by (Egan et al.,
2015)
∆n
≈ 2.65 × 10−7 ∆P [mbar].
(1.9)
n
This proportionality is valid at low pressures, where n − 1  1 . For example, for a target instability
of 1 × 10−16 at room temperature, the pressure instability would have to be .4 × 10−10 mbar. A
pressure sensitivity of ∼5 × 10−7 mbar−1 has been experimentally measured for a cryogenic silicon
cavity (Matei et al., 2016) by switching off the vacuum pump and observing the related frequency
drift.
In practice, the pressure is not measured inside the cavity spacer but at the location of the ion
pump and is estimated from the pump current, which can be sensitive to leakage currents and
electrical noise within the pump, its controller and their connections. A common approach is to
reach low enough absolute pressures to relax the requirements on the pressure fluctuations. At an
absolute pressure of ∼10−8 mbar, which is usually aimed for, fractional pressure fluctuations of 4%
are compatible with fractional frequency instabilities below 10−16 . This level of vacuum does not
require advanced vacuum techniques; it can be achieved with a standard ion pump and commercial
vacuum chambers or custom aluminium chambers with indium or lead sealing.

Temperature instability

For a cavity near room temperature and in vacuum, the main mechanism of heat transfer is
through thermal radiation. At room temperature the flux through conduction is at least one
order of magnitude smaller using standard interface materials such as FKM fluoroelastomers (for
instance Viton™) and PEEK polymers. The most effective strategy to isolate the cavity from the
environmental thermal radiation is to use low-emissivity thermal shields (typically polished or
gold-coated aluminium).
In the case of small temperature changes around room temperature, it is possible to derive
an approximate analytic expression for the characteristic thermal response time τ of a cavity
surrounded by N shields,

In addition, external temperature fluctuations could also be strongly transmitted to the cavity
by thermal conduction through the mountings of the shields and of the cavity. One can filter
the temperature fluctuations by using a combination of supporting points with very high thermal
resistance and thermal shields of high thermal capacity to increase the global thermal time constant
to the cavity. In the case of the cavity presented in Keller et al. (2014), the measured thermal time
constant between the temperature-controlled thermal shield outside the vacuum chamber and the
cavity is on the order of 50 hours. The temperature sensitivity of the cavity at the temperature
set-point was measured by applying small temperature steps to the temperature-regulated shield
and monitoring the frequency response of the cavity. With these two values, one can estimate the
contribution of the temperature fluctuations on the fractional frequency instability as depicted in
Figure 1.4 for this cavity.

1.1.5

Vibrations, acceleration sensitivities and effect of a tilt

The deformations due to environmental vibrations are one of the dominant instability contributions
for long cavities (Häfner et al., 2015) and a major concern for ultrastable lasers aiming to reach
instabilities below 10−15 . They are affected by the choice of geometry and materials. If we take the
example of a simple cylinder of ULE glass supported by four Viton rings placed approximately
at the Airy points of the spacer, as described in Keller et al. (2014), we can estimate a vertical
sensitivity due to the Poisson effect of 2.8 × 10−10 (m/s2 )−1 . The isolation offered by a passive
vibration-isolation table and an acoustic isolation box are usually sufficient to obtain short-term
fractional frequency instabilities slightly below 10−15 with such a system. To reach instabilities in
the low 10−16 , an optimised spacer and support geometry that exploits symmetries (Notcutt et al.,
2005; Nazarova et al., 2006; Ludlow et al., 2007; Webster et al., 2008; Millo et al., 2009; Keller
et al., 2014) has to be chosen. To give an idea of the typical vibration environment in a laboratory,
Figure 1.3 presents the level of vibrations that has been measured at PTB in Germany and the
isolation that can be achieved with a commercial vibration-isolation platform (Minus-K Technology
150BM-1).
Given the sensitivity of the cavity fractional frequency to vibrations along the vertical, transverse
and longitudinal directions, kv , kt and kl , respectively, the sensitivity to a spurious small tilt θ with
respect to the gravitational axis can be written as


where g is the gravitational acceleration and ϕ is the projection of the angular tilt on the t–l plane,
see Figure 1.2(b). To lowest order in θ , the tilt sensitivity is
d ∆ν
≈ g (kt cos ϕ + kl sin ϕ) .
dθ ν

(1.13)

OC18

1. Ultrastable lasers for optical clocks

As an example, for a sensitivity value measured in an existing cavity, kl = 1.7 × 10−10 /g (Häfner
et al., 2015), the angular tilt θ has to be stable within 0.1 arcsec (3 × 10−5 degrees) to have a
fractional stability of 1 × 10−16 .

1.1.6

Optical intracavity power

The intracavity power of a Fabry–Perot cavity increases with the finesse of its mirrors. As a
consequence, the instabilities of the optical power of the laser beam coupled into a high-finesse
cavity are amplified within the cavity. Due to the mirror losses, the intracavity power is converted
to a local heating of the cavity, thus changing its length through thermal expansion of the mirrors,
which results in a shift of the resonance frequency.
We take the example of a 12-cm-long ULE cavity with FS mirrors assembled at PTB (Keller
et al., 2014). The cavity has a measured finesse of around 280 000 and the mirror transmission at
822 nm is 1.2 × 10−6 . The sensitivity to the intracavity power has been determined by applying
a step of ±5 µW to the input power and monitoring the resulting frequency shifts. This gives a
sensitivity of 2 × 10−13 W−1 to the intracavity power. For a typical input power around 50 µW,
this sets a limit of around 1 × 10−4 on the fractional instability of the intracavity power to reach
fractional frequency instabilities in the low 10−16 . Power stabilisation can be realised by using
the optical power transmitted through the cavity on resonance to provide an error signal, and then
actuating on an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) placed before the cavity. One can estimate the
contribution of the intracavity power on the frequency stability by monitoring the cavity-transmitted
power and knowing the optical power coupled into the cavity and the sensitivity to the intracavity
power, as depicted for the 12-cm-long ULE cavity in Figure 1.4.

1.1.7

Residual amplitude modulation (RAM)

The frequency stabilisation of the majority of cavity-stabilised lasers is performed via the Pound–
Drever–Hall (PDH) locking technique, which requires the input beam to be phase modulated.
An additional amplitude modulation at the same frequency can be caused by etalon effects or
polarisation fluctuations if an electro-optic modulator (EOM) and a polarisation-selective optical
component is used (Whittaker et al., 1985; Zhang et al., 2014a), which is very often the case. This
RAM creates an unstable offset on the PDH error signal which transfers directly to a frequency
instability of the locked laser. The voltage fluctuations of the error signal away from resonance can
be converted to a contribution to the laser’s fractional frequency instability as
σy (τ) =

σδV D
,
ν

(1.14)

where σδV is the Allan deviation of the voltage fluctuations, D is the discriminant of the error signal
around resonance, defined in Section 1.1.2, and ν is the laser frequency.
Etalon effects inside the optical setup can be reduced by slightly tilting optical components.
The RAM produced by the EOM can be actively compensated (Zhang et al., 2014a) to a level of
1 × 10−6 . Another alternative is the use of Brewster-cut EOMs (Dooley et al., 2012; Tai et al., 2016)
that separate the ordinary and extra-ordinary polarisation components of the light, thus avoiding
interference in polarisation-selective elements. With these EOM geometries, etalon effects inside
the crystal itself can be avoided, and intrinsic RAM as low as 2 × 10−6 can be obtained. At these
levels, the RAM contribution to the fractional frequency instability is in the 10−17 range.

1.1.8

Fibre-length stabilisation

For most of the ultrastable lasers, the laser itself and the resonator are separated by optical fibres
of a few metres length. The stabilised light can also be sent to other buildings via longer fibres

three-cornered-hat measurement with two other stable lasers (Kessler et al., 2012a; Häfner et al., 2015).

(100 m or more). Shocks, vibrations and temperature variations produce local disturbances of the
refractive index of the fibres, thus varying the optical path of the laser. This results in a variation of
the laser’s frequency at the end of the fibre. Fortunately, the frequency fluctuations induced by the
travel through the fibre can be easily corrected by schemes involving a Michelson interferometer
and an AOM placed before or after the fibre (Lopez et al., 2012).
The realisation of such a scheme is useful if short-term fractional frequency instabilities below
10−14 are expected. As an example, we show in Figure 1.5 the instability of a 946-nm laser stabilised
to a 30-cm-long ULE cavity (Didier et al., 2019), which has been measured by comparison with a
1542-nm laser stabilised to a cryogenic silicon cavity with a fractional frequency instability below
10−16 from 50 ms to 500 s. The instability of the beat note is therefore dominated by the 946-nm
laser. The laser and the resonator are separated by a 10-m fibre inside the same room. The laser
is sent to another building through a 160-m fibre, where it is measured via a femtosecond laser
against the 1542-nm laser. From this measurement, one can get an idea of the typical instabilities
achievable without fibre-length stabilisation. The fibres have a non-negligible contribution when
instabilities below 10−15 are expected, especially for short integration times. For an instability of
10−16 or below, one should consider stabilising shorter fibres as well.
For more discussion on optical-path-length stabilisation, see Section 2.2, which covers transfer
of frequency stability from the laser source to the atoms.

1.2

Cryogenic silicon cavities

As discussed above, the fundamentally limiting thermal noise in Fabry–Perot cavities is proportional
to the cavity temperature T and the ratio ϕ/E of the mechanical loss factor ϕ and the Young’s
modulus E of the cavity constituents. Therefore, we search for a cavity material suitable for
cryogenic temperatures in combination with a very small mechanical loss factor and a large Young’s
modulus. Monocrystalline silicon has proven to be an excellent choice, since it has a zero crossing
of its coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) around 124 K, a mechanical loss factor of only 10−8
at low temperatures (three orders of magnitude smaller than that of ULE glass) and a large Young’s
modulus of up to 187.5 GPa. This allows for record-low thermal-noise-limited fractional frequency
instabilities in the 10−17 range.
Kessler et al. (2012a) first demonstrated a 212-mm-long cryogenic single-crystal silicon cavity
used for laser stabilisation at 1542 nm. This system realised a fractional frequency instability
of around 10−16 , still limited by technical noise. We finally demonstrated thermal-noise-limited
operation of two identical cavity-stabilised laser systems (in the following called Si2 and Si3)
with a fractional frequency instability of 4 × 10−17 (Matei et al., 2017). Going to even lower
temperatures around 4 K, at which the CTE of silicon asymptotically approaches zero, Zhang et al.
(2017b) demonstrated the operation of a 60-mm-long silicon cavity in a closed-cycle cryostat with a
fractional frequency instability of 1 × 10−16 . In the following we sum up the technical requirements
and specifications needed to realise ultrastable operation of cryogenic silicon cavities.

1.2.1

Cavity design and experimental setup

All systems cited above employ vertically mounted cavities made of single-crystal silicon with its
crystallographic h1 1 1i direction oriented along the cavity axis. The crystal orientation was chosen
to maximise Young’s modulus along this direction. In addition, the crystal shows a three-fold
symmetry with respect to the cavity axis, which perfectly fits to an unambiguously plane-defining
three-point support and allows for additional tuning and minimisation of the vertical acceleration
sensitivity just by varying the azimuthal angle between the crystal orientation and the support points
(Matei et al., 2016).
It is advantageous to machine the spacer and mirror substrates from the same low-impurity
silicon rod with a resistivity of ∼30 kΩ cm or above in order to prevent aging-related length drifts
of the final cavity. The cavity mirrors consist of low-loss dielectric Ta2 O5 /SiO2 multilayers, IBS
(ion beam sputtering) coated on the silicon substrates, allowing for a cavity finesse around 500 000.

Figure 1.6. Details of the 212-mm-long cavity setup. The photo (a) shows the vertically oriented silicon
cavity supported near its middle plane by a tripod made of PEEK. The support ring is made of silicon to
minimise thermal stress during cooling. A stainless-steel ring clamps the PEEK tripod in order to maximise
the frequency of mechanical resonances of the support. The sketch (b) shows the thermal concept with the
actively cooled “outer shield” and a passive “inner shield”, both made of gold-plated copper. The temperature
of the shields is measured at different spots by means of Pt100 temperature sensors (black filled circles),
while the cavity temperature is monitored with a pair of thermocouples (stars). The whole setup is placed in
a vacuum chamber with a residual pressure of 10−10 mbar. Figure reprinted from Matei et al. (2016) under
CC BY license.

The crystal orientation of the spacer and the optically contacted silicon mirrors were aligned to
each other in order to maintain the single-crystal behaviour of the entire cavity.
For minimal vibration sensitivity, see Section 1.1.5, the optimal cavity shape and the exact
vertical position of the cavity support need to be identified by means of finite-element-modelling
(FEM) simulations. The vertically oriented silicon cavities used in Matei et al. (2017) and Zhang
et al. (2017b) are designed as a “double cone” supported near its middle plane (see Figure 1.6).
For the 212-mm-long cavities an additional silicon ring placed around the upper part of the cavity
was used to optimise the vertical vibration sensitivity. The tripod support is made from PEEK
and is designed for high stiffness in order to shift mechanical resonances to higher frequencies
around 70 Hz.
The 212-mm-long cavities rest on a coldplate, which is temperature controlled to 124 K by
means of cold nitrogen gas from a liquid-nitrogen Dewar. An additional gold-plated, low-emissivity
thermal heat shield between the actively cooled surrounding and the cavity is used to suppress
residual temperature fluctuations of the temperature servo (compare Section 1.1.4).
Reaching even lower temperatures below 10 K requires more elaborate cooling devices. As
discussed in Zhang et al. (2017b), a Gifford–McMahon closed-cycle cryocooler is employed to
temperature stabilise a 60-mm-long silicon cavity to 4 K. Residual temperature fluctuations on the
order of 20 mK at the cryocooler’s cold head were damped by means of a multistage heat shield
system. A cylindrical plate made of holmium copper (HoCu2 ) placed between the cryocooler’s
cold finger and the bottom of the active shield allows for additional thermal damping due to its high
specific heat at low temperatures.
The closed-cycle cryosystem generates significant vibrations. On top of the cryocooler, accelerations of about 1 m/s2 peak-to-peak are measured. Therefore, the cryocooler is fixed to the
concrete floor of the lab and separated from the cavity chamber by bellows. The thermal link
between the cold finger and the 4-K heat shield as well as the link between the first cooling stage
16

OC18

1. Ultrastable lasers for optical clocks

and the 30-K shield are obtained by flexible copper braids. Furthermore, the vibration sensitivity
of the cavity must be extremely small. As the sensitivity scales with the cavity length, we have
designed a short cavity of 60-mm length.
We frequency stabilise commercial erbium-doped distributed-feedback (DFB) fibre lasers with
a wavelength of 1542 nm to the cavities using the Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH) method. A servo with
a locking bandwidth of around 200 kHz is achieved using fibre-coupled acousto-optic modulators
(AOMs) driven by voltage-controlled oscillators as fast actuators. Residual amplitude modulation
as discussed in Section 1.1.7 is actively compensated to keep the corresponding fractional frequency
fluctuations below the thermal noise level of the systems.

1.2.2

Technical specifications

To realise thermal-noise-limited operation of a cavity-stabilised laser system, one has to control
and minimise several sources of technical noise as discussed in Section 1.1. The following sections
will sum up the impact of residual noise on the silicon systems and might be useful as a guideline
for designing next-generation silicon cavities.
Pressure fluctuations
As discussed in Section 1.1.3, fluctuations in the residual vacuum pressure affect the index of
refraction and thus the optical path length of the cavity. To ensure a fractional length instability of
the silicon cavities below the thermal noise limit, one needs a base pressure well below 10−9 mbar.
Even with the large surface of all the components in the vacuum chamber, a standard ion pump with
approximately 30 l/s pumping speed is sufficient to realise this level because of the cryopumping
provided by the cold environment. Pressure variations affect the long-term stability of the system.
From the observed pressure fluctuations we estimate a frequency instability below 4 × 10−17 for
averaging times up to 2000 seconds (Matei et al., 2016).
Temperature stability
To minimise the impact of temperature fluctuations, the operating temperature of the cavity must be
set as close as possible to the zero-crossing point of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
of the silicon cavity. Close to the zero crossing, the CTE can be approximated as linear with a
slope of around 1.7 × 10−8 K−2 . Thus, a temperature offset of 50 mK leads to a CTE of around
8.5 × 10−10 K−1 . To ensure a length stability at the low 10−17 level, a temperature stability of about
10 nK is required.
For the Si2 and Si3 systems, the temperature fluctuations of the actively cooled heat shield
were on the order of 1 mK. Therefore, we need a thermal low-pass filter with a time constant on
the order of a few days to reduce residual temperature fluctuations of the temperature-controlled
environment. As shown in Figure 1.6, we use one additional passive heat shield surrounding the
cavity. The time constants for the heat flow between cavity and passive shield and passive shield
and active shield are 1.3 days and 6.5 days, respectively. The temperature fluctuations of the cavity
are below 1 nK for averaging times of a few seconds and affect the length stability only for times
of thousands of seconds and longer.
The long-term stability is also affected by the blackbody radiation from the environment
reaching the cavity through the windows of the vacuum chamber and heat shields. This becomes
more important in cryogenic systems, as the heat transfer between the environment at room4 − T 4 . Due to the
temperature Tenv and the cavity at the cryogenic temperature Tcav scales with Tenv
cav
good thermal insulation and the large time constants, any thermal radiation from outside leads to a
significant temperature offset of the cavity. Therefore, a careful blocking of blackbody radiation by

17

1. Ultrastable lasers for optical clocks

OC18

using appropriate glass windows is mandatory. Additionally limiting the solid angle by small tubes
at the windows of the passive heat shield will further reduce the radiation flux.
Vibration noise
As shown in Figure 1.3, the level of environmental vibrations increases for Fourier frequencies
above 1 Hz. Therefore, vibrations usually affect the laser performance most at short averaging
times. Using passive or active vibration-isolation platforms reduces the power spectral density
(PSD) of vibrations by about one to two orders of magnitude for frequencies above 0.5 Hz.
Assuming uncorrelated vibrations, the PSD of the frequency noise of the laser system, Sν , is
given by the sum of the vibration-noise PSDs in all three directions, Gx , Gy and Gz , weighted by
the corresponding vibration sensitivities kx , ky and kz of the cavity setup
Sν = Gx kx2 + Gy ky2 + Gz kz2 .

(1.15)

The sensitivities also include mechanical resonances of the whole setup. Therefore, the cavity
support must be designed for large stiffness, pushing resonances to higher frequencies. Besides
any resonances, the seismic spectrum above 1 Hz approximately leads to white frequency noise of
the laser system.
Hence, the short-term instability of most cavity-stabilised laser systems shows a
√
typical 1/ τ behaviour. Depending on the thermal noise level of the cavity, the vibration-noiselimited short-term stability completely determines the linewidth and thus the coherence time of the
laser (see Section 1.2.3).
The vibration sensitivities for the 212-mm-long silicon cavities are listed in Table 1.1. The vertical vibration sensitivities of Si2 and Si3 were experimentally minimised to below 10−12 (m/s2 )−1
by adjusting the azimuthal angle between the crystal orientation and the support points. The
horizontal sensitivities can be caused by, for example, mechanical tolerances, unbalanced forces
on the support points and the impact of mirror tilt due to a geometrical offset between cavity
mode and cavity axis. The impact of mirror tilt increases with increasing cavity length. FEM
simulations show that a 1-mm offset in the 212-mm-long silicon cavities leads to a sensitivity of
about 30 × 10−12 (m/s2 )−1 . Correspondingly, for the shorter cavity in Zhang et al. (2017b), we
only expect about 4 × 10−12 (m/s2 )−1 per mm offset.
For cryogenic systems, the employed cooling devices potentially lead to additional vibrations.
The 124-K temperature of the 212-mm-long cavities is simply achieved by cold nitrogen gas
flowing through a cooling base plate. The slow, laminar gas flow does not significantly increase the
vibration level. However, pulsed cryocoolers used for 4-K environments add significant noise to the
system. The two-stage Gifford–McMahon closed-cycle cryocooler (Montana Instruments) used
for the 60-mm-long silicon cavity (Zhang et al., 2017b) √
leads to residual vibrations on top of the
vibration-isolation platform of around 3 × 10−5 (m/s2 )/ Hz between 10 Hz and 400 Hz. This is
about two orders of magnitude more noise than on a vibration-isolation table without additional
cooling (compare with Figure 1.3). Thus, the cryocooler must be mechanically decoupled from
the cavity setup. The cavity system is connected to the cryosystem only by a vacuum bellow and

With this setup we could reduce the cryocooler vibrations by up to five orders of magnitude between
1 Hz and 10 Hz and by three orders of magnitude between 10 Hz and 400 Hz.

1.2.3

Frequency instability and coherence time

Figure 1.7 shows the result of the frequency instability measurement of the two 212-mm-long
silicon cavities Si2 and Si3. Both systems reach their thermal-noise-limited flicker floor in the
modified Allan deviation for averaging times between 0.8 s and a few tens of seconds. For short
averaging times, the systems are partly limited by the impact of residual vibration noise. The
long-term stability is affected by residual temperature and pressure fluctuations at the cavity and
parasitic etalons within the optics.
The coherence
√time of the lasers can be estimated from the instability measurement. Apart
from a factor of 2, the following deduction is commonly used in radio astronomy to derive
the coherence time from measurements of the frequency instability (Rogers and Moran, 1981;
Thompson et al., 2017).
We consider two-pulse Ramsey interrogation of atoms. In this scheme, one estimates the
average frequency of the laser from the preceding interval and uses that value for the current
interrogation in order to minimise the phase excursions between the pulses. The Allan deviation is
actually defined as the variance between successive frequencies νi , which can also be expressed in
terms of successive phase differences ∆φi

which is shown in Figure 1.7 as the dashed line.
The coherence time is defined by the intersection of σy (T0 ) with the individual frequency
stabilities of the lasers, which for the silicon systems Si2 and Si3 in Figure 1.7 gives a value of
about 11 s. Note that this value is not limited by the short-term stability of the lasers, but only by
their thermal-noise flicker floor. There is still some margin for increased vibration-induced white
frequency noise before this contribution will limit the coherence properties of the laser. For the
next-generation optical coatings (see Section 1.2.4) with even smaller thermal-noise flicker floor,
the long-term stability of the cavity becomes the limiting factor for the coherence time of the laser
system.

1.2.4

Next-generation optical coatings

The loss factor ϕ of silicon of around 10−8 is so much smaller than the loss factor of the dielectric
mirror coatings of about 4 × 10−4 that the few-µm-thick coatings can dominate the thermal noise of
the whole cavity. The difference between both contributions is very large. As shown in Table 1.2,
the thermal noise of the silicon spacer and the substrates is completely negligible compared to that
of the coatings. Thus, there is an urgent need for low-loss coatings.
Crystalline Alx Ga1−x As multilayers show a much smaller loss factor of only 17 × 10−6 . At
room temperature, these coatings have already demonstrated a large reduction in Brownian thermal
noise (Cole et al., 2013). As shown in Figure 1.1, combining these coatings with a 212-mm-long
silicon cavity at 124 K allows for a thermal-noise-limited frequency instability of about 1 × 10−17 .
At temperatures of 4 K or below, the thermal noise limit can even be pushed to about 2 × 10−18 and
below.
Thus, crystalline mirror coatings are a promising candidate for cryogenic cavities. However,
the coatings are not directly grown on the substrates, but are pressed in contact for a spontaneous
van der Waals bond. The thermally driven strain due to the CTE mismatch between the silicon
substrates and the Alx Ga1−x As multilayers can potentially exceed the bonding strength. Therefore,

π-pulse.

we have tested a pair of silicon mirrors employing crystalline mirror coatings at temperatures down
to 100 K. The 1-inch, plano-concave mirrors with a radius of curvature of 2 m were optically
contacted to a 100-mm-long silicon test spacer. Passing several cooling cycles, no degradation of
the mirrors was observed.
Due to mismatch strain between the high- and low-index components of the multilayer, the
coatings show a strong birefringence. For the 100-mm-long test cavity and a wavelength of
1542 nm, the birefringence resulted in a line splitting of the fundamental TEM00 mode of around
420 kHz. The internal coating strain seems much stronger than a potential thermal-driven mismatch
strain between coating and silicon substrate as we see a constant line splitting down to 100 K.
The coating transmission is optimised for cryogenic temperatures, thus the measured finesse
increased from around 300 000 at room temperature to almost 400 000 at 100 K. The new mirrors
will be used to replace the current dielectric mirrors on one of our silicon cavities in order to further
improve the frequency stability of our cavity-stabilised laser system.

1.3

Active resonators

We now turn our attention to an entirely different scheme for generating stable-frequency light.
Active resonators are based on cold atoms with narrow optical transitions placed inside an optical
cavity. The atomic sample is assumed to have a temperature in the millikelvin to microkelvin range,
provided by a magneto-optical trap (MOT), and is not necessarily placed in an optical lattice. This
cavity-atom system takes advantage of the strong coupling between atoms and cavity, where the
narrow atomic transition dominates the frequency response of the system. In the strong-coupling
regime, collective effects will dominate the dynamics. This has been suggested in a number of
publications as a new scheme for improving the spectral purity of light in connection with optical
clocks.
Below we list a number of important relations related to cavity-assisted collective phenomena
(Kuppens et al., 1994; Wang et al., 2000; Bohnet et al., 2012). We imagine cold atoms possessing
a narrow-transition line, such as group-two elements, placed in an optical cavity with finesse F ,
see Figure 1.8. The cavity linewidth is denoted by κ while the atomic transition linewidth is given
by Γ.

1.3.1

Bad-cavity regime

In most cases one considers the so-called bad-cavity regime. Here the cavity linewidth is significantly larger than the atomic transition linewidth, κ  Γ. Generally the system of cavity plus atoms

21

will oscillate at the geometric mean of the atomic resonance frequency and the cavity resonance
frequency, leading to a cavity jitter suppression factor

(1.19)

which for narrow transitions may be significantly smaller than unity, often of the order 10−3 to 10−5 .

1.3.2

Collective phenomena

In Figure 1.8 we depict a typical scenario of atoms placed inside a cavity. For the atom-cavity
system the most important parameter is the single-atom cooperativity
C0 =

4g20
6 λ2
= F 3 2,
κΓ
π w0

(1.20)

where g0 is the single-atom coupling strength, λ the transition wavelength and w0 the cavity waist
where the atoms are placed. Typical cooperativity values for a cavity with F = 1000 are C0 = 10−4
to 10−5 .
One way to interpret the cooperativity is simply as the ratio of the optical cross section to the
cavity waist area scaled by the finesse. Another way is to see the physics as diffraction-limited
coherent emission into the cavity mode, which in one dimension would scale as λ /w0 and in two
dimensions as (λ /w0 )2 , again scaled with the finesse.
For the number of atoms N in the cavity volume, the collective optical depth is given by
C = NC0 . For systems involving MOT samples, N may be as high as 106 . . . 107 , making the
collective cooperativity C as high as 1000 or more.

1.3.3

Collective emission into the cavity

The amount of photons emitted into the cavity mode by N atoms is a key parameter for evaluating
possible collective and even superradiance-like behaviour. This amount may be estimated by NC0 Γ.
For the case of a MOT with 106 . . . 107 atoms, a typical number would be 106 . . . 107 s−1 . This
number is to be compared with the typical decoherence rate Γdecoh in the system, for example,
spontaneous emission out of the cavity mode (at the rate Γ) or Doppler decoherence, which in
the case of a MOT sample is the dominant part. For the MOT sample this is usually a few MHz.
Another decoherence parameter one may consider is the transit time of the atoms moving out of the
cavity waist volume. If one can establish
NC0 Γ  Γdecoh ,

(1.21)

collective effects are prone to appear and even dominate the physics of the system.

1.3.4

Cavity collective-emission linewidth

For the situation where the atoms in the cavity are excited by a π-pulse (in practice more than 50%
of the entire atom sample should be excited) and meet the above criteria, the atoms will emit a burst
of light into the cavity mode. In this case one may calculate the linewidth (Chen, 2009; Meiser
et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2011; Bohnet et al., 2012; Norcia and Thompson, 2016; Norcia et al.,
2016).
One may show that the linewidth of superradiant light emitted from the cavity mode in atomcavity collective operation is given by

condition for continuous superradiant operation — an optical maser. To reduce decoherence as introduced
by Doppler effects, several cooling stages of the atomic beam must be introduced.

provided that one meets the criterion given by Equation (1.21). Thus, decreasing the single-atom
cooperativity will make the linewidth smaller. This is done by having a cavity with lower finesse
(worse mirrors), which at first seems counterintuitive. However, if the finesse is decreased, the
number of atoms must be correspondingly increased, which is not always an easy task. For typical
values one may have a linewidth of 1–10 Hz or lower.

1.3.5

Continuous superradiant mode

One of the great challenges is to find a way to operate the atom-cavity collective phenomena
continuously, rather than in a burst mode. Several authors have worked out numerical examples
based on the basic physics above (Yu and Chen, 2008; Chen, 2009; Kazakov and Schumm, 2013,
2014). In Figure 1.9 we show schematically a case where cold pre-cooled atoms traverse an optical
cavity. In addition to longitudinal cooling of the atomic beam, transverse cooling stages are also
important to reduce possible decoherence effects. Before the atoms enter the cavity region they are
optically prepared in the excited state.
Following Kazakov and Schumm (2014), we may determine the atomic flux threshold (number
of atoms entering the cavity per second) for sustained superradiant operation
Rth =

π 3 v2
,
3λ 2 ΓF

(1.23)

where v is the atom velocity. With a beam velocity of 30 m s−1 and a cavity finesse of 200 000 we
find Rth = 2 × 106 s−1 ; a number that should be realistic from an experimental point of view.
This technique for generating stable laser light is very much in its infancy compared with
the more established techniques using high-finesse optical cavities. Nevertheless, the science is
progressing well and active resonators remain a promising approach to pursue into the future.

1.4

Spectral hole burning

Another novel approach for stabilising laser frequencies is that of spectral hole burning, which
relies on ultra-narrow spectral features in rare-earth-doped crystals at cryogenic temperatures
(typically below 20 K). A hyperfine splitting of the ground state in some rare-earth elements
leads to the appearance of metastable substates with lifetimes of several hours at temperatures of
4 K and below. Perturbations from the crystalline matrix in which these atoms are held lead to
inhomogeneous broadening of the linewidth up to a few GHz. By applying a narrow-linewidth
23

1. Ultrastable lasers for optical clocks

OC18

(<100 Hz) laser to the inhomogeneously broadened absorption spectrum, resonant rare-earth atoms
will be optically pumped to these metastable states. This generates a narrow spectral hole in the
inhomogeneously broadened spectrum, which persists for several hours after extinction of the
“burning” laser. Subsequent laser probing of this narrow spectral feature allows an error signal
to be generated, which can be used to frequency lock the “probing” laser to the spectral-hole
frequency (Julsgaard et al., 2007). In this application the burning and probing lasers are at the same
frequency, but their optical powers are orders of magnitude apart, so as to keep the residual burning
effect of the probing laser as small as possible.
As a case study, we present the details of our spectral-hole-burning setup at LNE-SYRTE. We
have utilised 0.1% doped Eu3+ :Y2 SiO5 crystals, which exhibit an inhomogeneously broadened
absorption spectrum near 580-nm vacuum wavelength on the 7 F0 →5 D0 transition. The 5 × 8 ×
8 mm3 crystal is maintained in a pulse-tube-based closed-cycle cryostat, specially designed for low
vibrations of the crystal. The burning and probing beams propagate along the b crystalline axis
and are polarised along the D1 axis, a configuration which provides the largest absorption (Ferrier
et al., 2016). In this setup, we have realised <2 kHz narrow spectral features at 3.5 K (although
typical operation with ≈3.5 kHz linewidth is currently preferred for maximal contrast-to-linewidth
ratio). Frequency locking the probing laser based on the spectral hole and measuring the fractional
frequency stability (overlapping Allan variance, 1-kHz measurement bandwidth) with an optical
frequency comb, phase locked to a 1.5-µm Fabry–Perot-stabilised laser, leads to a combined
instability of 1.8 × 10−15 at 1 s. From independent assessment of the 1.5-µm CW laser, this implies
an intrinsic instability of the spectral-hole-burning-stabilised laser near 1.7 × 10−15 at 1 s.
We have measured the effect of temperature fluctuations on the frequency shift of spectral
holes and have confirmed previous measurements by NIST (15 kHz/K sensitivity for site 1). In
the current development at LNE-SYRTE, this effect is identified as the main contribution to the
currently measured instability at the low 10−15 level. Additional work on active temperature
stabilisation of the cryostat and passive isolation of the crystal temperature from the environment
should lead to a substantial improvement in the near future. Furthermore, cancellation of the
thermal sensitivity to first order using He background gas following the method used at NIST
(Thorpe et al., 2011) should lead to several orders-of-magnitude improvement of this contribution
in the future.
We have measured the effect of uniaxial strain applied to the crystal (ranging from 6 to
120 Hz/Pa frequency shift for the different directions and crystallographic sites), which provides a
quantitative assessment of the effect of residual vibrations (accelerations) on the crystal (estimated
with a piezoelectric accelerometer at room temperature with the pulse tube on). Preliminary
measurements imply that this effect is compatible with <10−16 instability at 1 s. Specially designed
mounting of the crystal, similar to what is commonly done with Fabry–Perot-stabilised lasers (Millo
et al., 2009), should lead to the impact of residual vibrations on instability being at <10−17 level at
1 s.
The detection noise of the measurement of the mismatch between the probing-laser frequency
and the spectral-hole central frequency was estimated to be compatible with a 5 × 10−16 instability
at 1 s, approximately a factor of five larger than the fundamental limit imposed by photon shot
noise under our probing conditions and compatible with thermal-noise and photo-diode-efficiency
calculations. Further improvement of the design of the measurement chain should allow reaching
the shot-noise limit in the near future. Increasing the effective probing power, thereby lowering the
shot- and thermal-noise-induced limit would allow the detection-noise contribution to be below
the 10−16 level, although at the cost of increasing the residual burning effect of the probe laser,
which already currently limits the time of optimal operation to about 1 h (after which the holes are
broadened by an “over-burning” effect by a factor of two or more and need to be re-generated).
Utilising several spectral holes in parallel so as to increase the effective probing optical power
without increasing the power per hole will be utilised in the future to further decrease detection
24

noise. Furthermore, decreasing the linewidth of the spectral holes and increasing their contrast,
which may be achieved at lower temperature and in the presence of strong polarising magnetic
fields (Equall et al., 1994), would also permit a further decrease in the detection noise. Thus, a total
contribution of a few 10−18 seems achievable.
Further work will also be required to investigate, quantify and minimise the impact of electricand magnetic-field fluctuations from the environment (Thorpe et al., 2013). When these technical
challenges have been addressed, we will be able to explore the fundamental limits of the stability
of spectral-hole-burning-stabilised lasers.

1.5

Summary

The tremendous progress in ultrastable lasers during the last few years has allowed essential
improvements in the stability and accuracy of optical atomic clocks. Nowadays laser systems
stabilised to room-temperature glass cavities realise frequency instabilities in the low 10−16 range
for averaging times of 1 s. This was only possible by carefully addressing and minimising the
impact of all technical noise sources affecting the length stability of the Fabry–Perot cavities. We
have given an overview of the potential noise sources and showed how to reduce their impact. It can
be shown that the frequency stability and the coherence properties of the lasers is then fundamentally
limited by the cavities’ Brownian thermal noise. This noise is determined by the cavity dimensions,
material parameters and the operating temperature. With less noisy materials, such as crystalline
silicon placed in a cryogenic environment, we have pushed the thermal-noise-limited frequency
instability down to a record-low level of 4 × 10−17 . With even lower temperatures and with novel,
low-noise crystalline mirror coatings, laser systems with frequency instabilities below 10−18 are
feasible.
However, the technical challenge becomes increasingly demanding. Therefore, alternative
approaches for generating ultrastable optical frequencies are being explored. The “active resonator”
scheme employs cold atoms placed inside optical cavities. The strong coupling between the cavity
mode and the chosen narrow optical transition of the atoms then allows for collective phenomena
leading to the emission of narrow-linewidth superradiant light. In a second approach we have
investigated spectral hole burning in rare-earth-doped crystals at cryogenic temperatures. With
spectral-hole-burning-stabilised lasers, frequency instabilities at the low 10−15 level have already
been realised. Potentially, this technique will also allow ultrastable lasers with 10−18 frequency
instabilities.

This chapter explains how to transfer the frequency stability from an ultrastable laser source to the
beam probing the atoms in an optical clock, whilst adding no more than 1 × 10−17 to the laser noise
after 1 s. In Section 2.1, we describe how to transfer the frequency stability from one wavelength to
another, using a femtosecond optical frequency comb. This is necessary for cases where the laser
source is stabilised to a reference, such as an optical cavity at a particular wavelength, but the atoms
must be probed at a different wavelength. In Section 2.2, the challenges of setting up the beam path
to deliver the laser light to the atoms with minimum propagation noise are described.

2.1.1

Transfer of spectral purity
Outline of the problem

In optical atomic clocks, the residual frequency noise of the ultrastable laser source probing the
narrow atomic resonance is a key element of the stability of the clock. For instance, it is the
sampling of this frequency noise, the Dick effect (Santarelli
pet al., 1998), that limits the stability
−16 / τ [s], while the quantum projection
of even the most advanced lattice clocks
to
a
few

noise would allow levels below 10−17 / τ [s] for 104 atoms probed simultaneously. Therefore, the
potential of optical clocks has not yet been fully explored, and further progress in laser stability,
such as that pursued in the OC18 project, is required.
It is often convenient to build ultrastable lasers at a wavelength where components are easily
available and where narrow-laser technologies already exist in order to reduce the requirements
on the electronic system necessary to reduce the linewidth. Typically, 1064 nm (Nd:YAG laser)
and the 1530–1565-nm band (C-band, used for optical infrared telecommunications) are very
favourable domains. The most traditional method to achieve ultrastable frequencies is to lock
a laser to a narrow-linewidth linear optical resonator, composed of two mirrors contacted to a
ultra-low-expansion (ULE) glass spacer (see Section 1.1). This system exhibits a thermal noise floor
due to the Brownian motion of the elements composing the cavity, and it is often the contribution

is highly reliable but needs specific outputs after frequency conversion to reach the metrological wavelengths
necessary for optical clocks.

of the mirror coatings that dominates. For a given geometry (spacer length, radii of curvature of
the mirrors), the size of the laser beams on the mirrors are larger for infrared light; therefore, the
thermal noise is better averaged. Hence, it is favourable to build a laser in the infrared domain and
to transfer its frequency stability to the clock-interrogation light field with high fidelity, i.e., adding
as little as possible excess noise from the transfer setup.
The transfer process is based on the transfer-oscillator method (Telle et al., 2002) applied to
a frequency comb with teeth of frequencies νN = N frep + f0 , where frep is the repetition rate of
the comb and f0 the carrier-envelope-offset (CEO) frequency. This method allows the spectral
properties of a master (M) laser (frequency νM ) to be transferred to a slave (S) laser (frequency
νS ) in the Fourier frequency range covered by the bandwidth of the feedback loop. The choice of
frequency-comb technology is motivated by the frequencies νM and νS involved: they must be part
of the spectral range covered by the comb, either directly or after frequency conversion (Figure 2.1).
In what follows, we present the practical details of the implementation and the pros and cons of the
alternative approaches.

2.1.2

The transfer oscillator in practice

The transfer-oscillator technique is based on the photodetection of the beat notes between the
frequency comb and the master on the one hand ( fM = νM − NM frep − f0 ) and the slave on the other
hand ( fS = νS − NS frep − f0 ), see Figure 2.2. The technical parameters of the comb, frep and f0 ,
are not a priori ultrastable quantities; therefore, it is necessary to eliminate them.
The classical technique is to detect f0 with an f –2 f interferometer and to mix f0 out of fM
and fS in order to form f
fM = νM − NM frep and feS = νS − NS frep . Recently, CEO-free combs have
appeared. These are based on difference-frequency generation between the two far ends of an initial
comb with nonzero CEO frequency. In this case, the first step to remove the CEO frequency is not
necessary (Puppe et al., 2016).
Subsequently, f
fM and feS are divided by float numbers MM and MS , respectively, such that

Figure 2.2. Principle of the transfer of spectral purity. The optical beat notes (comb vs slave and comb vs

f0 of the comb is detected by PD2 and mixed out of the optical beat notes. These f0 -free beats are first
regenerated by tracking oscillators before re-scaling by a division factor M and mixing to form the transfer
beat ft . This carries all the information on the relative fluctuations of the master and slave lasers in the
bandwidth chosen by the trackings. Finally, the transfer beat is locked to, e.g., a synthesiser, and the feedback
to the AOM will force the slave laser to follow the residual fluctuations of the master laser. The propagation
noise of some of the optical paths is not compensated (dashed lines). The strategy to tackle this issue is
described in Section 2.2.2. VCO: voltage-controlled oscillator, PLL: phase-locked loop, AOM: acousto-optic
modulator, PD: photodiode.

This leads to a direct relation between νM and νS , thus justifying that the comb is only used as an
intermediate oscillator. It must be noted that the sign of the quantities fM and fS is not known a
priori; the relevant component at the output of the mixer forming ft is the one immune to a change
of frep .
The rescaling itself is best performed with a direct digital synthesiser (DDS), with a number

of bits that is typically K = 32 or 48. The beat notes f
oscillators in order to clean up the signal and to regenerate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The
bandwidth of the tracking must be adjusted to avoid copying the electronic noise limiting the SNR
of f
fM and feS . Furthermore, the tracking bandwidths of the two beats should be matched in order
to eliminate the transfer oscillator in the same range of Fourier frequencies. The DDSs are then
clocked by these filtered signals and act as frequency dividers: the possible DDS output frequencies
are fout = fin /M, with M = 2K /n and n an integer in the range [0, 2K−1 ]. In practice, it is best
to keep the signals at high frequencies and to use M numbers that are as small as possible. The
simplest alternative is to divide the beat note corresponding to the laser with the smaller frequency
by M = 2 and to adapt the other division factor in order to satisfy Equation (2.1), resulting in a
second M number between 2 and 4 if the lasers’ frequencies are within the octave covered by the
comb.
Finally, the transfer frequency is phase locked to a stable enough reference, e.g., a synthesiser
or a hydrogen maser. The actuator to act on the frequency of the slave laser can be, for instance,
an AOM. In this way, any pre-stabilisation of the slave laser can be decoupled from the correction
from the master laser. The final relation between the two lasers reads

(2.3)

The quantity fsynth , typically a few tens of MHz, is seven orders of magnitude smaller than νM , so
its absolute noise can be neglected even if the fractional stability of the synthesiser is not better

Considering that photodiodes detect phase signals and that the feedback is implemented via a
phase-locked loop, Equation (2.3) can be integrated and gives the same deterministic relation
between the phase of the two lasers and of the synthesiser.
Since the division factors M are at least 2, if NM and NS differ by less than a factor two, it
is necessary to rescale both f
fM and feS . If, on the other hand, NM and NS are more than a factor
two apart, rescaling the beat note of highest N by a division factor max (NM , NS )/ min (NM , NS ) is
sufficient, and the other beat note can be left unchanged.

2.1.3

Limitations of the method

This technique nevertheless has limitations that must be carefully considered. These are due either
to an incomplete elimination of the comb parameters or to technical noise added by the successive
loops necessary for the transfer.
The M numbers are critical: as the choice of n (“tuning word” of the DDS) is discrete, there
can be a residual contribution of frep

It can easily be shown that ε is at most max (NM , NS )/2K , i.e., on the order of 10−8 for a K = 48 bit
DDS. In order to ensure that the noise contribution of ε frep is small compared to that from νM /MM at
all timescales, the usual technique is to stabilise frep to an external reference (optical or microwave),
or to choose a combination of N and M numbers leading to a further rejection of frep .
Often it is not possible to form all the beat notes with the same output of the comb, because
the master or the slave laser is not directly within reach of the spectrum of the comb. Additional
dedicated optical amplifiers can then be used in order to amplify a specific spectral region of the
comb output before frequency conversion towards a target metrological wavelength. This is the case,
for instance, with the erbium comb and the strontium lattice clock: the atomic resonance (698 nm)
is not accessible with this type of comb (1000–2000 nm), but it is possible to add an erbium-doped
fibre amplifier (EDFA) followed by spectral shifting or broadening to 1396 nm, typically in a highly
nonlinear fibre, and by a doubling crystal that finally converts it to the relevant window of the
spectrum around 698 nm. However, adding specific amplifiers comes at the expense of losing
common-mode noise rejection: when the beat notes fM and fS are formed with independent outputs
of the comb, the approach is said to be multi-branch, in contrast to the single-branch technique,
where a unique comb output is sufficient to form beat notes with the master and the slave, thus
suppressing the influence of path-length fluctuations.
The CEO beat can be generated using an f –2 f interferometer in a separate comb branch,
because it is not sensitive to path-length fluctuations, but only to dispersion fluctuations. Thus,
elimination of f0 is easier, as it is a small quantity offsetting a beat note in the optical domain, while
the noise on frep is multiplied by a large lever arm (the N number).

2.1.4

Single-branch transfer

In the single-branch configuration, excess noise mainly results from differential path-length fluctuations between the light fields at the two optical frequencies involved and from beat-detection noise.
The OC18 team has developed setups for superposition of the CW light fields with the comb light,
29

2. Transferring frequency stability from the laser source to the atoms

efficiently eliminating differential path-length fluctuations along all critical paths. This enables
unsurpassed residual instability of the transfer setup consisting of the fibres starting at the optical
frequency-comb generator and at the reference and clock light sources.
In the context of OC18, the single-branch method has been used at PTB to transfer the stability
of a 1542-nm Si-cavity-stabilised laser (frequency νSi ) to the Sr-lattice-clock (νSr ) or Yb+ -ion-clock
interrogation light field and at LNE-SYRTE to transfer the stability of a 1542-nm laser to the Sr
(698 nm) and Hg (1062 nm before quadrupling) lattice clocks.
The single-branch principle is illustrated in Figure 2.2. In what follows, we study two examples
of transfer from 1542 nm towards metrological wavelengths (698 nm and 1062 nm) with an erbium
comb.
1542 nm towards 698 nm
The transfer from the infrared domain towards a metrological wavelength in the visible range,
such as 1542 nm towards the Sr resonance at 698 nm is complicated, since 698 nm is not directly
accessible by EDFAs. When a single branch is used, the comb light fields near both frequencies
(νSi and νSr ) propagate on a common path until the superposition beam combiner, i.e., they stem
from a single branch of the comb setup. For the Si–Sr stability transfer, this branch consists of a
single EDFA, a nonlinear fibre for spectral broadening, and a PPLN (periodically-poled lithium
niobate) crystal frequency doubler in series. Besides the efficiently generated comb light near νSr ,
the fundamental comb light near νSi is present behind the frequency doubler, and the light fields
propagate entirely on a common path. Hence, path-length fluctuations are differentially cancelled
out due to common-mode rejection.
As a second step, the fibres supplying the CW fields are length stabilised up to reference planes
defined by partial mirrors. Most of the light power is transmitted through the semi-transparent
reference mirrors. Shortly behind the mirrors, the two CW fields are superposed and from there
on the fields propagate on a common path, which again efficiently suppresses differential phase
fluctuations due to path-length variations (Benkler et al., 2019). At the beam combiner, the CW
light fields at the two frequencies interfere with the comb lines coming from the single branch.
Hence, they can subsequently be separated using a dichroic mirror, which allows detection on
separate photodiodes without adding differential phase fluctuations. The detected beat signals
have a linewidth of 25 kHz (1542-nm laser vs comb) and 80 kHz (698-nm laser vs comb); these
signals are tracked in a 2-MHz band. After mixing out the CEO beat signal of the comb, a transfer
beat signal between the two CW fields can be derived following the transfer-oscillator scheme.
This can be implemented either computationally by post-processing the simultaneously counted
beat frequencies or in real time using RF hardware (see Figure 2.3). Besides the excess noise, the
transfer beat signal carries information about the relative fluctuations between the two CW light
fields. Hence, it can be used either for analysing the stability-transfer performance or for phase
locking the clock light field such that the relative fluctuations are eliminated, i.e., the stability is
actually transferred.
1542 nm towards 1062 nm
A slightly different single-branch transfer between pairs of metrological wavelengths was performed
at LNE-SYRTE: any combination of master and slave is possible between 1062 nm (metrological
probing of Hg atoms, after quadrupling), 1160 nm (laser based on the spectral hole burning
technique, see Section 1.4) and 1542 nm (reference channel for the European fibre link). Contrary
to the previous case, these three wavelengths are within reach of a single EDFA without any
frequency conversion, which facilitates the required setup. In this case study, the comb at LNESYRTE is not free-running: after elimination of f0 , a tooth of the comb is phase locked to a

reference infrared ultrastable laser, whose fractional stability (6 × 10−16 ) is transferred to frep .
The comb is said to be in the “narrow-linewidth regime”. It is important to note that the transferoscillator technique eliminates frep at Fourier frequencies allowed by the tracking bandwidths;
the frequency of the reference is then purely arbitrary. Stabilising the comb has only practical
implications, notably the linewidths of f
fM and feS depend only on the stability of the lasers chosen
as master, slave, and reference. In the present case, all the lasers at play have a noise floor <10−14 ,
the beats are less than 1 Hz wide, and they are tracked in a band of a few kHz in practice. The
transfer oscillator was applied to this setup and the analysis of the performance is described in the
next section.
Out-of-loop assessment
The performance of the transfer is in practice limited by technical effects: residual uncompensated
optical paths, similar to the ones described in Figure 2.2, imperfect mode matching between the
beams, limited signal-to-noise ratios, cycle slips that degrade the correlation and therefore the
stability, and residual contributions from dispersion fluctuations. Uncorrelated electronic noise in
the different branches of the setup is unlikely to perturb the transfer by more than the equivalent of
1 × 10−18 in the optical domain.
In order to quantify the residual noise, the single-branch setup must be tested by transferring
the stability from the master laser to the slave laser using one frequency comb, and by testing the
result using a second independent comb. This out-of-loop measurement is absolutely necessary to
assess the performance of the setup. The noise of the transfer itself, εtrans , can be modelled by

Figure 2.4. Results of the single-branch transfer of spectral purity from 1542 nm to 1062 nm. The
resulting stability, around 8 × 10−18 at 1 s, includes the contribution of the transfer by the first comb and
the contribution of the detection by the second comb. If this limit is due to, e.g., uncompensated paths on
both sides, we can assume that the noise due to the transfer itself is around (5 . . . 6) × 10−18 at 1 s in the case
studied here.

From the acquisition of ft0 , we can directly derive an instability plot showing the Allan deviation
versus averaging time τ, see Figure 2.4. The stability at 1 s, around 8 × 10−18 , is a bit higher than
the limit set by the signal-to-noise ratio (38 dB in 1 kHz corresponds to a stability limit of around
1.4 × 10−18 /τ [s] at 1062 nm for one photodiode). The residual noise, around a few 10−18 , is likely
to be due to uncompensated paths.
Estimating the total noise of the slave laser can be done only by comparing to another laser that
is equally or more stable, by using a cross-correlator (Nelson and Howe, 2012; Xie et al., 2017)
with two secondary sources, or by probing atoms in a clock and inferring the stability of the laser
from the Dick effect.
Case of Yb combs
An approach that is more exploratory is to use frequency combs based on Yb-doped fibre lasers.
These lasers surpass Er-doped technology in several technical aspects, such as power, power
efficiency, pulse energy, and minimum achievable pulse duration. The supercontinuum generated
by Yb-fibre lasers typically covers the range 650–1450 nm. Therefore, it eliminates the need for
additional conversion processes for many wavelengths of metrological interest. The large power
available across the range eliminates the need for dedicated amplifiers. Hence, the Yb combs show
an interesting potential for all-single-branch transfer of spectral purity. In the context of OC18,
TÜBİTAK has developed such an Yb frequency comb with pulses as short as 33 fs, which is a factor
ten shorter than for typical Er combs (Şenel et al., 2018). At the same time, the total dispersion of
the cavity was minimised for low-noise supercontinuum generation.

2.1.5

Multi-branch transfer

In cases where the aim is to transfer the stability of a single highly stable master laser to several
other CW slave lasers operating at different wavelengths, a multi-branch frequency comb has some
practical advantages over a single-branch comb. In a multi-branch configuration, a dedicated optical
amplifier and nonlinear fibre, perhaps followed by a frequency-doubling stage, are used to generate
a narrow-band (typically 1–3 nm) frequency-comb output around each CW laser frequency of

interest. Each output is therefore used to form only one beat note between the comb and one of the
lasers. The advantage of this approach is that it enables independent optimisation of the signal-tonoise ratio of the multiple beats. In contrast, with a single-branch comb it can be challenging to
optimise the broadened spectrum for simultaneous detection of multiple beat signals.
The increased flexibility of the multi-branch approach, however, brings with it the possibility
of differential phase noise between the branches, which has been reported previously to limit the
stability transfer to typically the low parts in 1016 level for an averaging time of 1 s (Nicolodi et al.,
2014; Nakajima et al., 2010; Hagemann et al., 2013). The CEO frequency is detected independently

However, experiments performed within the OC18 project have shown that with carefully
designed beat-detection systems better performance can be achieved. These experiments used
the multi-branch erbium-doped fibre comb shown in Figure 2.5, which is designed to transfer
the stability of a 1064-nm master oscillator to five other wavelengths simultaneously. These are
the wavelengths of interest for probing the optical clocks under development at NPL (strontium
lattice clock, ytterbium and strontium single-ion clocks) and a 1542-nm laser required for opticalclock comparisons using optical fibre links. The femtosecond fibre laser has a repetition rate of
250 MHz and all fibres after the output of this laser are polarisation-maintaining. The multi-branch
configuration makes it straightforward to obtain signal-to-noise ratios of at least 30 dB in 300-kHz
bandwidth for all optical beat notes between the CW lasers and the comb.

Figure 2.6. Out-of-loop measurement setup used to assess the performance of the stability transfer using the
multi-branch frequency comb. The beat frequencies necessary to determine the various optical frequencies
are counted synchronously using FXE frequency counters from K+K Messtechnik operating in Λ mode.

A further design choice that must be made when using a frequency comb to transfer the stability
of an ultrastable laser from one frequency to another is the method for stabilisation of the frequency
comb. Here two degrees of freedom must be controlled, or at least measured, which determine both
the mode spacing (repetition rate) frep and carrier-envelope-offset frequency f0 . One possibility is
to tightly lock one mode of the frequency comb to the master oscillator, and then to phase-lock f0
to either an RF synthesiser or a sub-harmonic of the repetition rate. To achieve sufficiently tight
phase locking requires fast actuators and typically means that the femtosecond laser must include
an intracavity electro-optic modulator. An alternative to tight phase locking is to weakly stabilise
the comb to an RF oscillator such as a hydrogen maser, and to compensate for the residual noise of
the comb modes using the transfer-oscillator scheme (Telle et al., 2002). This can be more robust
for long-term operation and is therefore the approach used in the NPL experiments.
The effectiveness of the multi-branch approach for stability was tested by stabilising the
various clock lasers to the multi-branch comb using the transfer-oscillator technique, and then
measuring the optical frequency ratios between pairs of lasers using a second, independent optical
frequency comb (Figure 2.6). This reference comb was of a different design to the first, not using
polarisation-maintaining fibre, and having two broadband outputs, one around 500–1000 nm, and
the other around 1–2 µm. All clock-laser outputs were heterodyned with the first of these two
broadband outputs, meaning that the reference comb is essentially single-branch for pairs of these
wavelengths. However, the 1064-nm laser output was heterodyned with the longer-wavelength
branch, so for optical-frequency-ratio measurements involving this wavelength, the reference
comb is also multi-branch. The reference comb and the multi-branch comb under test are located
in separate laboratories with different temperature-control systems, and so the correlated noise
between the two systems is expected to be negligible.
The results obtained are shown in Figure 2.7 and indicate the importance that should be placed
on careful design on the beat-detection systems. For initial measurements, fibre-coupled beatdetection systems were used, with the retroreflectors used for phase-noise cancellation of the
incoming clock-laser light located several metres away and 2-m uncompensated (and unshielded)

experiments, the beat-detection systems for 871 nm and 934 nm were replaced by systems based on
free-space optics and with the retroreflectors for the phase-noise compensation located much closer
to the beat-frequency detector. This enabled much better performance to be achieved, approaching
the 10−17 level at 1-s averaging time, close to the single-branch performance reported previously
by Nicolodi et al. (2014).

2.2
2.2.1

Delivering the stability to the atoms
Outline of the problem

Delivering an ultrastable optical carrier to the atoms (neutrals or ions) is a problem that includes
several aspects. By design, the ultrastable reference point of the clock laser is, for instance, the
input mirror of an ultrastable cavity or the frequency actuator (e.g., AOM) used for transferring the
spectral purity. In order to ensure that the propagation of the wave from this point to the atoms does
not degrade the initial stability, it is necessary to detect the phase noise accumulated in the course
of the propagation and to compensate it.
The stabilisation is equivalent to controlling the optical path length, i.e., controlling the integrated index of refraction of the different elements traversed by the wave along its path. This
includes passive elements (e.g., free-space or in-fibre propagation, nonlinear crystals for frequency
conversion) and active elements (optical amplifiers). The end point chosen to transfer the stability
to is also a critical parameter: the atoms must be rigidly referenced to this point in order to avoid
uncontrolled Doppler effects that could degrade the performance of the clock.

2.2.2

Fibre stabilisation

In the simplest case, there is only a short path and an AOM for switching and frequency steering
the beam between the clock-laser reference point and the atoms. Often, optical fibres are employed
to transfer the light even over short distances, inducing additional phase noise that needs to be
cancelled in an optical-path-length stabilisation setup. The spectral broadening induced by fibrelength fluctuations depends on the length, type and environment of the fibre used. A 100-m
single-mode fibre in a typical environment causes a homogeneous spectral broadening on the
order of a few kHz. Fibre-length fluctuations can be detected in a double-pass configuration and
compensated with a phase-locked loop acting on an AOM (Ma et al., 1994; Newbury et al., 2007;
Foreman et al., 2007).
However, even without using fibres, pressure and temperature fluctuations in a typical laboratory
environment can cause significant phase noise on the order of 1 rad/s. A slow drift of the optical path
length by even 3 nm/s results in a systematic bias of 10−17 . Figure 2.8 shows a comparison of phase
stability for an enclosed and open free-space interferometer in a typical laboratory environment.
We see that even short unstabilised beam paths should be avoided, kept as short as possible, and/or
protected against pressure and temperature fluctuations (Nicolodi et al., 2014).
For typical path-length-stabilisation approaches, a bidirectional invariant beam path with defined
end point is needed. For more complex optical elements with competing reflecting surfaces, this
condition is not always fulfilled and a double-pass marker AOM is required as close as possible
to the back-reflecting surface to identify the reference signal by its frequency without ambiguity.
A generic setup is shown in Figure 2.9. It is based on interference between a part of the light
taken as close as possible to the initial ultrastable point (phase Φ0 ) and light that has made a round
trip to the plane we want to transfer the stability to (phase Φ0 + 2ΦAO1 + 2Φpropagation + 2ΦAO2 ).
The interferometric detection yields a beat note whose phase 2ΦAO1 + 2Φpropagation + 2ΦAO2 is
phase locked to a DDS (ΦDDS ) by inducing feedback to an AOM physically close to the detection

Figure 2.9. Stabilisation of an optical path with defined end point rigidly linked to the atoms. This
configuration is the simplest one; no element (isolator, amplifier, etc.) prevents the light from being
retroreflected all the way back. A Michelson interferometer compares the propagation phase between a short
local-oscillator arm and the path between the ultrastable laser and the atoms. The input of the interferometer
is as close as possible to the reference the laser is locked to (typically the input mirror of an ultrastable
cavity), while the back end is a plane tightly linked to the atoms. This approach relies on the fact that
identical phase fluctuations are experienced by the light on the way to the atoms and on the way back. The
photodiode detects the phase difference that is locked to, e.g., a DDS via feedback to AOM1. AOM2 is used
as a frequency discriminator in order to identify without ambiguity the part of the light effectively reflected
by the end point. For typical laboratory distances (10 m), the bandwidth is not limited by the propagation
time of the light, but rather by the input bandwidth of AOM1 (a few MHz at most).

photodiode. Therefore, the light experienced by the atoms has a phase Φ0 + ΦDDS /2, which is an
ultrastable quantity. A critical point is the reference arm: since it is the local oscillator used for the
reference, its path must be kept as short and isolated as possible. Typically, this arm must be at
most a few cm long, well shielded, and possibly put under vacuum. In the case of multiple fibres,
all phase stabilised, a good practice to avoid crosstalk is to design the setup in such a way that all
the beat notes to be locked are at different frequencies.

2.2.3

Methods to control the noise of optical amplifiers

With more complex beam paths including active components that allow bi-directional operation,
such as bi-directional EDFAs, the previous strategy still applies. However, some components may
not allow retro-reflected light propagation. In these cases the length stabilisation is realised with
a Mach–Zehnder interferometer, where the phase of the main light path is locked to a stabilised
reference arm bypassing the optical element as shown in Figure 2.10. The feedback is applied
through an AOM and again it is important to keep the differential, unstabilised path between the
main and reference path as short and shielded as possible to avoid unwanted propagation noise.
Typical in-loop stabilities are shown in Figure 2.11, with residual instabilities smaller than 10−16
after 1 s and averaging down as 1/τ.

2.2.4

Methods to investigate the noise of nonlinear processes

If the clock transition frequency is not directly accessible by suitable laser sources, a more sophisticated beam path is often required. Typically, clock transitions are in the visible to ultraviolet
region, e.g., Al+ at 267 nm (Chou et al., 2010) and Yb+ E3 at 467 nm (Huntemann et al., 2016),
while high-finesse mirrors with small absorption and suitable lasers are only available in the visible
or infrared spectral range. In cases where frequency conversion such as doubling is required, phase
stability needs to be maintained through the conversion process. An upper bound for the phase
noise added through the doubling process has been investigated in Delehaye et al. (2017). It is of
the same order of magnitude as that of a laser with 4 × 10−17 flicker floor (Matei et al., 2017) for
Fourier frequencies between 1 and 10 Hz, and smaller everywhere else (Herbers, 2019). In the case
of bidirectional waveguide doublers, phase stabilisation can in principle include the doubler. If
further frequency-conversion steps are required or an extended path length is required afterwards,
time-dependent dispersion can introduce additional phase noise. One option to maintain phase

Allan deviation of main- and reference-path interference (see Figure 2.10) with and without active length
stabilisation. For times τ < 0.1 s, the signal was mixed down and recorded using a fast-Fourier-transform
(FFT) analyser. For longer times, the signal was recorded with a frequency counter.

stability under this condition is to use residual fundamental light after the doubler for stabilisation
and begin a new stabilisation loop with the reference point for the doubled frequency as close as
possible to the reference point of the fundamental light. This way only the phase-noise contribution
from refractive-index differences in the nonlinear medium remains, and these are small (Delehaye
et al., 2017).
Special care has to be taken when pump-beam resonance cavities are employed for frequency
conversion. The cavity acts as a bandpass filter for the resonant light, so it induces a frequencydependent phase shift ∆φ = arg (|Et (ω)|2 ) to the resonant transmitted field

(2.10)

The residual length fluctuations of the cavity lock with respect to the resonance condition translates
into phase fluctuations of the near-resonant light. Therefore, the phase shift due to uncorrected
residual length fluctuations can be monitored via the error-signal slope (see Figure 2.12). For
example, for a doubling cavity locked to within 1% of its error signal slope, the added phase noise
is 10−7 rad2 /Hz (white phase noise in 10 kHz range), limiting the stability at a level of 3×10−17
at 1 s for radiation at 1070 nm.

2.2.5

Methods to reference the clock-laser phase to the atomic trapping potential

Optical clocks are based on trapped atoms, which allows extended spectroscopy times, resulting
in a better Fourier resolution of the resonance. Atoms are typically confined in a “magic” optical

lattice (neutrals) or in a Paul trap (ions). Therefore, they are rigidly fixed to this external potential.
It is crucial that this potential and the end point of the clock-laser phase stabilisation are tightly
connected. Relative motion of the trapping potential with respect to the reference point can result
in:
• A loss of stability, if the motion is not synchronous with the cycle frequency of the clock.
The stability would be degraded at a time corresponding to the period of the motion.
• A bias if the motion is synchronous, because it then systematically induces a Doppler shift at
each interrogation.
In the case of optical lattice clocks, several strategies can be implemented:
• If the standing wave (lattice) trapping the atoms is formed by a single retroreflection from a
mirror, then this mirror can also be used as the end point for the clock-laser phase stabilisation.
The coating must simply be adjusted to reflect >99% at normal incidence at the magic
wavelength (Falke et al., 2012), and to send around 1 µW of clock light backwards in order
to close the interferometer. Considering that a standing wave on the clock-laser light would
result in a modulation of the Rabi frequency, and thus in a broadening of the transition, the
lattice laser and the clock laser must come from opposite sides of the mirror.
• If the lattice is formed inside an enhancement cavity, a similar approach can be implemented;
the cavity input mirror can be coated to reflect part of the clock light before it enters the
cavity. Again, it is important that the second (output) mirror is sufficiently AR coated at the
clock wavelength to avoid a standing wave.
In the context of ion clocks, the approach studied in OC18 is to fix a mirror directly on the
ion trap, see Figure 2.13 (Hannig et al., 2019). This way, all length fluctuations relative to the
trap are cancelled and only the motion of the ion relative to the trap remains. While the effort of
implementing phase stability all the way to the ion trap can be significant, its necessity can be tested
independently of clock operation in an interferometric setup.
It is also important to activate the phase stabilisation of the clock laser as soon as the spectroscopy pulse begins. This can be achieved by using an AOM to pulse the probe laser and having
the feedback loop, as described in Figure 2.9, catch up rapidly to avoid any systematic phase

oscillations while the loop settles down (Falke et al., 2012). Another possibility is to have the clock
laser on all the time, but to detune it sufficiently far away from resonance (typically ∼1 MHz) when
no spectroscopy of the narrow resonance is ongoing.

Summary

In conclusion, this chapter has presented the typical problems that are encountered when transferring
the frequency stability of an ultrastable laser source from one wavelength to another, and also
when propagating the laser light towards the atoms. In each case, practical suggestions have been
given on how to overcome the difficulties, and case studies have been presented from several of the
laboratories in Europe. The techniques employed have allowed frequency stability to be transferred
from the laser source to the atoms, whilst adding no more than 1 × 10−17 to the laser noise at 1 s.

This chapter summarises requirements and practical recommendations for the design of ion traps
for single-ion optical clocks. Here we consider in particular the case of alkaline-earth-metal ions
(like Ca+ and Sr+ ) and ions with similar level systems (like Hg+ and Yb+ ), characterised by a
2S
1/2 ground state and a strong electric-dipole-allowed resonance transition that is used for Doppler
cooling. With a suitable ion trap setup, confinement-induced frequency shifts of the clock reference
transition can be reduced to the low 10−17 range or less for these ion species (Ludlow et al., 2015).
In present single-ion clocks, the coherent interaction time between the probe laser and the trapped
ion is typically limited to less than 1 s. This appears to be the main obstacle to further improvements
in stability and accuracy. Therefore, particular attention will be paid to design features that support
long probe times by minimising motional heating of the trapped ion in the absence of laser cooling.
Another point of interest is to eliminate sources of excessive thermal radiation in the trap setup so
that the AC Stark shift induced by blackbody radiation can be evaluated more accurately (Doležal
et al., 2015).
Section 3.1 describes the basic characteristics of ion storage in radio-frequency (RF) traps, with
emphasis on aspects relevant to the design of traps for optical clocks that enable long probe times.
Section 3.2 considers advantageous options for trap electrode geometry, materials and electrical
circuitry connected to the trap electrodes. In Section 3.3, we describe two of the ion traps that have
been newly developed in the frame of the OC18 project with consideration of the guidelines noted
here.

3.1

Traps for single-ion clocks: theory and design requirements

The traps employed in optical clocks serve the purpose of confining the active atoms or ions in
a small volume where they are excited by cooling and probe lasers. Ideally the trap provides a
harmonic conservative potential of the form
Φ(r) =


1
ξx x2 + ξy y2 + ξz z2 ,
2

(3.1)

where r = (x, y, z) denotes the particle position in a coordinate system that is aligned with the
principal axes of the trap, and the steepness of the potential is described by the parameters ξi
(i = x, y, z). A particle with mass m and non-zero kinetic energy oscillates along the principal axes
with frequencies ωi = (ξi /m)1/2 . The one-dimensional time-averaged kinetic energy hEi i of the
particle is related to the oscillation amplitude ai0 through hEi i = m(ai0 ωi )2 /4.

αy = −αz /2. The purple and green surfaces correspond to the conditions Φrf (t = 0) < 0 and Φrf (t = 0) > 0,
respectively.

In a quantum description, a useful measure for hEi i is the average harmonic-oscillator quantum
number n̄i = hEi i/(h̄ωi ) − 1/2, where h̄ is the reduced Planck constant. At ni = 0, the kinetic energy
of the trapped particle is the zero-point energy h̄ωi /2 and its localisation is described by a Gaussian
wave function whose spread is given by a2i (ni = 0) = h̄/(2mωi ).

3.1.1

Radio-frequency Paul trap

For ions, a trap potential that is much larger than the typical kinetic energy at room temperature
can be generated through the Coulomb force. The electric field of an ion trap must have an
oscillating component because Earnshaw’s theorem states that static electric fields cannot provide
three-dimensional confinement. In the Paul trap and related RF trap electrode geometries, the trap
field can be purely oscillatory. For optical clocks based on ions with alkaline-earth-metal-type
level systems, this is advantageous because the substantial linear quadrupole shift of the reference
transition frequency that is caused by the gradient of the trap field is averaged out.
Radio-frequency Paul traps use an arrangement of electrodes that supports an oscillating electric
quadrupole potential of the form
Φrf (r,t) = Vrf cos Ωt

(αx x2 + αy y2 + αz z2 )
,
2d 2

(3.2)

with the condition αx + αy + αz = 0 imposed by the Laplace equation. Here Vrf and Ω are the
amplitude and frequency of the drive voltage applied between the trap electrodes, and d is a
geometrical scaling parameter. For an electrode system that is symmetric around the z axis,
αx = αy = −αz /2. With αz = 1, Equation (3.2) describes the ideal case that Φrf (r,t) is generated
by electrodes that have a distance 2d on the z axis and whose shapes are determined by the
corresponding hyperbolic equipotential surfaces of Equation (3.2), as shown in Figure 3.1.
Equation (3.2) implies that the oscillating trap field vanishes at the symmetry centre. Such
a field-free nodal point also exists if the electrodes have simplified shapes and are not precisely
symmetric, provided that the phase of the RF potential is strictly spatially uniform as described
by the Vrf cos Ωt prefactor in Equation (3.2). In this case and near the nodal point, also simplified
electrode geometries are well described by Equation (3.2) by setting αz = η < 1. Here η can be

considered as an efficiency factor that lies in the range 0.2 . η . 0.9 for commonly used trap
geometries.
The equation of motion of an ion with charge-to-mass ratio e/m in an axisymmetric quadrupole
RF field has bounded solutions if the axial stability parameter,
2ηVrf e
,

md 2 Ω2
lies in the range 0 ≤ qz . 0.92 (Paul, 1990). For qz ≥ 0.55, imperfections of the potential can lead
to unstable operation at certain values of qz (Alheit et al., 1995). The motion in the RF potential
can be approximately described as a free “secular” oscillation in a time-independent harmonic
potential like Equation (3.1). Excursions from the potential minimum are accompanied by motion
at a smaller amplitude that is driven by the inhomogeneous RF field. The average kinetic energy of
this intrinsic micromotion is equal to that of the secular oscillation.
Neglecting
√ terms of higher order in qz , the secular oscillation frequencies are given by
ωz ≈ qz Ω/(2 2) and ωx = ωy = ωz /2. The secular oscillation frequencies can be modified
by superposing a DC quadrupole field on the RF trap field. For example, for a positively charged
ion the addition of a negative (positive) DC voltage to Vrf cos Ωt, see Equation (3.2), can decrease ωz
(ωx and ωy ) to the point where the axial (radial) trap potential vanishes. In a similar way, additional
DC-biased electrodes can be used to lift the degeneracy of ωx and ωy .
qz =

Doppler cooling and Lamb–Dicke condition
The secular oscillation of a trapped ion along the propagation direction of the clock-laser beam leads
to an oscillating linear Doppler shift that can prevent coherent excitation of the ion. To suppress
effects related to the linear Doppler shift, the secular oscillation amplitude must be reduced to
ai0 < λ /2π, where λ is the laser wavelength. In a quantum description, this corresponds to the
Lamb–Dicke condition (Leibfried et al., 2003)
[ki ai (ni = 0)]2 (2n̄i + 1)  1,

(3.4)

where ki denotes the projection of the clock-laser k vector on the principal trap axis i. For a
given residual motional energy of the trapped ion, Equation (3.4) yields a condition on the secular
frequencies because ai (ni = 0) and n̄i depend on ωi .
If the secular frequencies ωi are non-degenerate, three-dimensional Doppler cooling of a
trapped ion is possible with a single cooling laser beam whose k vector has non-zero projections
on all principal axes of the trap potential. The lowest achievable vibrational quantum number is
n̄i ∼ CΓ/(2ωi ) where Γ denotes the natural linewidth of the cooling transition and C is a constant of
order unity that depends on the cooling geometry. With n̄i  1 and θi denoting the angle between
the clock-laser k vector and the principal axis i, Equation (3.4) leads to
ωi2  C(2π cos θi /λ )2 h̄Γ/(2m)

(3.5)

as the Lamb–Dicke condition on the secular frequencies of an ion with clock transition wavelength λ .
For the alkaline-earth-metal-like ions considered here, Equation (3.5) indicates minimum axial
secular frequencies in the range 0.5 MHz . ωz /2π . 5 MHz, with the highest demands set by Hg+
due to the comparatively short wavelength (282 nm) and the large natural linewidth of the cooling
transition (120 MHz).
Equation (3.5) has some direct implications on the design and operating parameters of traps
for single-ion clocks. Assuming a target value ωz /2π = 2 MHz together with a stability parameter
qz = 0.5 leads to a trap drive frequency of Ω/2π ≈ 11 MHz. For an atomic mass of 100 amu,
the drive-voltage amplitude of a trap with efficiency factor η = 1 and axial electrode separation
2d = 1 mm is then calculated as Vrf ≈ 330 V. The resulting axial potential depth is Φ(0, 0, d) =
e2Vrf2 /(4mΩ2 d 2 ) ≈ 20 eV.

3. Guidelines for optimised ion traps

Excess micromotion
For an RF trap potential of the form of Equation (3.2) and Ω  ωz , the amplitude of intrinsic
micromotion is much smaller than that of the secular oscillation. However, in experiments involving
laser-cooled ions in RF traps one commonly observes excess micromotion (EMM) that persists in
the limit of vanishing secular oscillation amplitude. EMM can be caused by static electric stray
fields that displace a trapped ion from the RF node. Another source of EMM is a nonuniform
phase of the RF trap potential due to asymmetric phase delays of the RF voltages present on the
trap electrodes. The two types of EMM can be distinguished through the phase shift of the motion
relative to trap drive voltage (Berkeland et al., 1998; Keller et al., 2015).
To suppress stray-field-induced EMM, adjustable DC voltages are usually applied between the
trap electrodes and suitably placed compensation electrodes. The suppression of EMM caused
by phase delays is more difficult because it requires adjustments in the layout of RF-carrying
conductors or the application of RF voltages with well-defined phase shifts relative to the trap drive
voltage.
Trap-induced shifts of the clock transition frequency
Shifts related to ion motion: For the ion species considered here, Doppler cooling can reduce the
second-order Doppler (time-dilation) shift and the quadratic Stark shift due to residual interaction
with the trap field to maximum relative magnitudes in the low 10−17 range (Ludlow et al., 2015).
However, this requires sensitive three-dimensional detection of EMM and a stray-field compensation
accuracy of .10 V/m (Berkeland et al., 1998; Keller et al., 2015). A much lower EMM sensitivity
can be achieved if EMM-induced Doppler and Stark shifts cancel each other. This is possible if
the scalar quadratic Stark shift of the atomic reference transition frequency is positive and the trap
drive frequency Ω is set to a particular value. For the 2 S1/2 → 2 D5/2 reference transitions of Sr+
and Ca+ , the required values of Ω are in an experimentally convenient range (Dubé et al., 2014;
Cao et al., 2017).
Quadrupole shift: Atomic states with J > 1/2 can have a non-zero quadrupole moment that couples
to the electric field gradient present at the trap centre. According to Equation (3.2), the RF trap
generates electric field gradients that would cause a quadrupole shift with typical relative magnitude
10−13 . However, the shift oscillates in sign at the trap drive frequency and quickly averages to zero.
It is therefore only necessary to take account of static electric field gradients at the ion, such as
from stray electric fields and from the applied EMM compensation field. Electric field gradients
from these two effects typically lead to a static quadrupole shift of relative magnitude 10−15 . This
shift can be cancelled through spectroscopic averaging schemes that also cancel the tensorial Stark
shift (Itano, 2000; Dubé et al., 2005). Like stray-field-induced EMM, also the stray-field-induced
quadrupole shift can show significant variations, for example, after ion loading or illumination of
the trap electrodes (Tamm et al., 2009).
Trap-drive-induced Zeeman shift: The capacitance between the trap electrodes gives rise to conduction and displacement currents and thus to an RF magnetic field whose amplitude is proportional
to ΩVrf . Its spatial variation near the trap centre is determined by the electrode geometry and the
current-density pattern in the electrodes, which is strongly influenced by the skin effect. Generally one expects that many types of symmetry imperfections can lead to a non-vanishing RF
magnetic field at the nodal point of the electric trap field. For a trapped ion, the resulting oscillating
Zeeman shift of the reference transition sublevels can introduce errors in EMM detection and in
quadratic-Zeeman-shift measurements (Gan et al., 2018).
Blackbody-radiation shift: The electric field associated with the blackbody radiation (BBR) emitted
by the trap structure and the inner surface of the vacuum chamber gives rise to a quadratic Stark shift

45

3. Guidelines for optimised ion traps

OC18

of the reference transition frequency. If the thermal radiation is isotropic, the tensor contribution to
the shift averages to zero. For the ion species considered here, the relative magnitude of the BBR
shift is in the range of 10−16 to 10−15 at temperature T = 300 K and scales as T 4 . The components
of the trap structure are subject to heating through resistive loss in RF conductors and dielectric
loss in insulators exposed to the RF trap drive voltage. The BBR intensity at trap centre critically
depends on the spatial arrangement of hot surfaces, their infrared emissivity and on the thermal
conduction between components inside and outside the vacuum chamber. A thermal analysis of
various trap designs indicates that a careful selection of materials and components can limit the
effective temperature increase of the BBR incident on the trapped ion to less than 1 K relative to
an external heat sink (Doležal et al., 2015). See Section 6.4 for more details on characterising the
BBR shift in ion clocks.

3.1.2

Motional heating due to electrical field noise

A trapped ion is held in close proximity to the electrodes that create the trap potential. In the
absence of laser cooling, the secular oscillation is not damped so that a resonant electric field
originating from the electrodes can continuously raise the secular oscillation amplitude. The gain
of secular oscillation energy is usually quantified through the motional heating rate n̄˙ i that denotes
the rate of increase of the corresponding harmonic-oscillator quantum number. For an electric field
oriented parallel to the secular mode i, the heating rate is given by (Brownnutt et al., 2015)
n̄˙ i ≈

e2
SE (ωi ),
4mh̄ωi

(3.6)

where SE is the spectral density of the electric field noise at frequency ωi (unit (V/m)2 Hz−1 ) .
Typically the largest contribution to n̄˙ i originates from the field produced by the electrodes
that are nearest to the trap centre. Noise superimposed on the trap drive voltage cannot efficiently
excite the secular oscillation of an ion located close to the nodal point of the trap field. Parametric
excitation through sidebands at Ω ± 2ωi is supported by the quadrupolar trap-electrode geometry
but is usually well suppressed by the strong spectral filtering of the trap drive voltage (see below).
The kinetic energy of a trapped ion that is Doppler cooled to satisfy the Lamb–Dicke condition
typically corresponds to a vibrational quantum number n̄i ≈ 10. Unless limited by other effects, the
maximum coherent interaction time between probe laser and ion is determined by the time when
the acquired secular heating leads to a violation of the Lamb–Dicke condition. The increase in
motional energy due to secular heating also leads to increased motion-induced shifts of the clock
transition frequency. Therefore, it is usually desirable to reduce the secular heating rates along all
trap axes in order to satisfy n̄˙ i τ ≤ n̄i , where τ is the probe pulse length.
Sources of electrical field noise
Thermal (Johnson) noise: The thermal noise voltage Vn produced by an ideal resistance R has
a spectral density per unit bandwidth of hVn2 i = 4kB T R, where kB is the Boltzmann constant.
The heating rate of an ion that is confined between two trap electrodes connected through a
resistance R can be estimated using Equation (3.6) by setting SE = 4kB T R/d 02 , where d 0 ∼ 2d
is the effective distance between the electrodes. Using d 0 = 1 mm, T = 300 K, m = 100 amu,
ωz /2π = 2 MHz, and R = 1 kΩ as a resistance value commonly used in electronic setups, we
obtain SE = 1.7 × 10−11 (V/m)2 Hz−1 and n̄˙ z = 480 s−1 . For optical clocks, such a heating rate
is a serious impediment. A heating rate of this magnitude is also expected if resistors in the kΩ
range are used in the input circuit of a broadband low-noise amplifier whose output is directly
connected to a trap electrode. Low-pass filter networks can efficiently suppress the thermal noise of
DC voltages applied to the trap electrodes. In this way, the equivalent noise resistance between the
46

OC18

3. Guidelines for optimised ion traps

electrodes in the secular-frequency range can be reduced to well below 1 Ω so that it is comparable
to the expected resistance of the electrodes and attached conductors.
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) and pickup: Many electronic devices such as switched-mode
power supplies internally generate large AC currents with harmonics extending to the RF range.
Consequently, non-negligible electric and magnetic fields in the secular-frequency range can be
emitted, for example, through connections to control inputs or the mains supply. The frequency
spectrum of this interference typically contains multiple components at fluctuating frequencies.
EMI-induced voltage differences between trap electrodes are an efficient source of motional heating
even if there is only a transient resonance at a secular frequency. EMI transmitted through stray
capacitances can be suppressed by conductive shielding or by providing a low AC impedance
between the points where the EMI voltage appears. The magnetic part of EMI can be suppressed
by minimizing the area of exposed conductor loops. This also applies to loops formed by ground
connections between devices in the setup.
Anomalous heating by surface noise: In most experiments involving single ions or Coulomb crystals
in ion traps, one observes secular heating rates many orders of magnitude larger than that expected
from external fields and Johnson noise. This so-called anomalous heating is attributed to impurities
that are adsorbed to the trap-electrode surfaces. In fact, monomolecular layers containing oxygen
and carbon are known to form on metal surfaces exposed to ambient air in less than 1 h (Taborelli,
2017). The chemical structure of the adsorbates that cause anomalous heating is still not fully
known.
Secular heating due to anomalous heating can be characterised through power laws that describe
how the spectral density of the associated electric-field noise SE depends on frequency ω and

where d0 and ω0 are normalisation constants. Observed strength factors S0 vary by several orders
of magnitude between apparently similar experimental setups and large changes can also occur,
for example, after breaking the vacuum or cleaning procedures. Typically S0 decreases strongly if
a trap is operated at cryogenic temperature. In agreement with several theoretical models, most
experimental observations indicate a distance scaling according to 3.5 . k . 4 and frequency
dependence according to 0.5 . l . 1.5 in the usual secular-frequency range (Brownnutt et al., 2015;
Kumph et al., 2016; Boldin et al., 2018).
In a number of investigations where high anomalous heating rates were observed and contamination of the trap electrodes with carbon compounds was detected, SE could be strongly reduced
by in situ cleaning with a rare-gas ion beam. Most of these experiments were conducted with
electroplated gold electrodes in miniaturised planar traps (Hite et al., 2012). For nonplanar traps, it
seems more attractive to minimise SE by maximising the trap size and by identifying favourable
electrode materials and chemical and mechanical surface-conditioning methods.
Low electric-field-noise levels corresponding to anomalous heating rates n̄˙ z . 10 s−1 in mmsized traps have been reported for gold-plated (Keller et al., 2019; Poulsen et al., 2012) and
molybdenum trap electrodes (Diedrich et al., 1989; Turchette et al., 2000; Roos et al., 1999). These
electrode materials will be considered in more detail in Section 3.2.2. It may be noted, however,
that comparably low heating rates have also been obtained with other electrode materials, including
stainless steel (Rohde et al., 2001) and evaporated aluminium and copper layers (Daniilidis et al.,
2014).

Trap design
Trap geometry and size

Trap electrodes whose shape closely approximates the equipotential surfaces shown in Figure 3.1
are not useful for single-ion clocks because several cooling and probe laser beams must pass
through the trap centre without large geometrical constraints. Moreover, fluorescence detection
typically requires a free aperture angle of at least 20°.
Two simplified RF quadrupole electrode geometries that offer sufficient optical access are
shown in Figure 3.2. The geometrical reduction leads to reduced efficiency factors η < 1 and to
anharmonic contributions to the trap potential. The geometries shown in Figure 3.2 have enough
degrees of freedom to minimise the anharmonicity by suppressing the third- and fourth-order terms
in the spherical-harmonics expansion of the potential. Ring electrode geometries, see Figure 3.2(a),
optimised with this constraint can achieve efficiency factors η ≈ 0.9 (Beaty, 1987). For an endcap
trap with grounded outer electrodes, Figure 3.2(b), optimised in the same way, an efficiency factor
η ≈ 0.4 was found (Stein, 2010). A distinctive feature of endcap trap geometries is that the
trap drive voltage is applied to two spatially separate electrodes. In order to avoid EMM due to
unbalanced phase shifts, any asymmetry in the connections of the electrodes to the drive voltage
must be avoided. The direct connection of both electrodes to Vrf ensures that the equivalent noise
resistance between them is negligible. Voltage differences that appear between the outer electrodes
have a much smaller effect on the ion because the endcap electrodes act as a shield.
A further simplified electrode geometry with planar endcap faces is shown in Figure 3.3(a).
This design permits a higher machining accuracy and facilitates mechanical polishing of the endcap
faces. The introduction of a small plane segment r2 − r1 at the end of the outer electrodes supports
high machining accuracy for the critical distance d1 − d. With this electrode geometry, only the
lowest-order anharmonic term in the trap potential can be suppressed by suitable choice of r/d.
This is sufficient to reduce the fractional anharmonicity of the trap potential to a few per cent in the
region −0.5d ≤ z ≤ 0.5d. The resulting efficiency factor is around η ≈ 0.6.
Due to the strong dependence of the anomalous secular heating rate on the distance of the
ion from the electrode surfaces, it is desirable to scale traps for single-ion clocks to the largest
possible size d. Equation (3.3) implies that fixing the parameters ωz , qz , Ω and η also determines

the ratio Vrf /d 2 . Consequently, scaling to a larger trap size requires a quadratic increase of Vrf .
In current single-ion clock setups, trap drive voltages are typically limited to Vrf . 1000 V,
which limits the trap size to d ≈ 0.5 mm. In many cases the Vrf limit arises either from the limited
power-handling capability of the helical-resonator circuit that generates the trap drive voltage
or from dielectric loss in the insulators exposed to it. Some of the construction features and
components described in the following and in Section 3.3 can be instrumental for upscaled trap
designs that require drive voltages above 1000 V.

3.2.2

Electrode and insulator materials

Molybdenum electrodes: As noted above, molybdenum (Mo) trap electrodes appear to be an advantageous choice for single-ion clocks because very low anomalous heating rates were observed in
a number of experiments. This feature might be related to the low chemical reactivity of Mo at
room temperature which is comparable to noble metals. Another useful property of Mo is the high
thermal and electrical conductivity that is only a factor of three smaller than that of copper and silver.
The hardness of Mo is comparable to iron so that similar machining and tooling recommendations
apply.
It is useful to polish the trap electrode surfaces nearest to the ion because surface irregularities
caused by machining can complicate cleaning and promote the adsorption of contaminants. The
hardness of Mo facilitates efficient mechanical polishing. For Mo electrodes, a microroughness of
approximately 20 nm can be achieved (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2016).
Gold-coated electrodes: Stainless steel or Mo electrodes coated by a gold (Au) layer are another
favourable option for ion traps with low anomalous heating rates. The thickness of the deposited
Au layer should be not much smaller than the skin depth at the trap drive frequency (20 µm at
Ω/2π = 15 MHz) so that thickness variations do not strongly affect the surface current distribution.
Layers of this thickness are usually deposited by electroplating. For trap electrodes, this poses a
risk because impurities transferred from the electrolytic bath can contribute to anomalous heating.
Therefore, deposition by evaporation or sputtering is preferable even if much longer processing
times are required.
Insulators with low dielectric loss: Typically, the heating of insulators due to intrinsic dielectric
loss is the main source of excessive blackbody radiation in RF ion traps (Doležal et al., 2015).
49

3. Guidelines for optimised ion traps

OC18

Insulating elements made from fused silica (quartz glass), alumina ceramic, sapphire, or CVD
(chemical-vapor-deposition) diamond have favourably low dielectric losses. With these materials,
one expects that the dissipated thermal power can be reduced to negligible levels provided that
the electric field strength in the material is restricted by the geometrical design of the insulator
and attached conductors. It should be noted, however, that the dielectric losses of fused silica and
alumina can vary widely depending on the purity of the material. Fused silica has the advantage of
low relative permittivity (εr = 3.8) and can be readily obtained in the form of optical substrates
with specified spectral transmittance, which is indicative of the impurity level.

3.2.3

Compensation electrodes and atom source

To cancel stray-field-induced EMM, an electric field must be generated that compensates the three
spatial components of the stray field at the trap centre. In an endcap trap geometry as shown in
Figure 3.2(b), the axial stray-field component can be easily compensated by applying antisymmetric
DC voltages Vz and V−z = −Vz to the outer trap electrodes.
In order to cancel the radial stray-field components, it is useful to arrange four compensation
electrodes in the symmetry plane of the trap as shown in Figure 3.3(b). In practice, the shape of the
compensation electrodes is not critical and they can be made from wires bent towards the centre in
the symmetry plane of the trap. If the distance of the wire ends from the trap centre is around 5d,
the voltages required for stray-field compensation are expected to be around ±50 V.
For appropriate biasing of the radial compensation electrodes, it is advantageous to provide
separate adjustment modes for symmetric and antisymmetric voltage variations. Antisymmetric
biasing of the electrodes according to V−x = −Vx and V−y = −Vy compensates the radial stray field
in the x and y directions. Since the field produced by the compensation electrodes is inhomogeneous,
also the static field gradient at the trap centre is altered by the applied voltages. Symmetric biasing
according to Vx = V−x and Vy = V−y makes it possible to rotate the principal axes of the trap potential
in the radial plane without first-order effect on the EMM cancellation. This adjustment may be
useful in order to ensure that the k vector of the cooling laser beam has non-vanishing projections on
both radial principal axes of the trap potential, as required for three-dimensional Doppler cooling.
Ions are generated at the trap centre by photoionisation of atoms produced by a source (for
example, a small atomic oven) that is remote from the trap. As indicated in Figure 3.3(b), it is
advantageous to also place the orifice of the source in the symmetry plane of the trap because this
minimises the exposure of the trap-electrode end faces to the emitted atomic beam. During trap
operation, the source should be either grounded or biased together with the nearest compensation
electrode.

3.2.4

Biasing and filter circuitry

Figure 3.4 schematically shows the essential peripheral components and devices that are required
for trap operation and their connection to the trap electrodes. The trap drive voltage applied to
the endcap electrodes is provided by a helical resonator that acts as a step-up transformer for the
RF-amplifier output at frequency Ω. The resonance quality factor Q = Ω/δ Ω, where δ Ω is the
width between the half-power points of the resonance, of a helical resonator is mainly determined
by the RF resistance of the copper wire or rod of the resonator coil, which is subject to the skin
effect. At Ω/2π ≈ 25 MHz and with impedance-matched coupling, a quality factor Q = 640 can
be achieved using a rod diameter of 6 mm (Pyka, 2013). The Q value is not significantly reduced
if insulators with low dielectric loss (see Section 3.2.2) are used in the vacuum feedthrough of
the trap drive voltage and between the trap electrodes. On the other hand, transmission of the
helical-resonator output even through a short length of cable strongly reduces the Q value and the
resonance frequency. Consequently, the helical resonator must be located close to the trap with

a low-capacitance shielding of its output that connects resonator enclosure and vacuum chamber
(see Figure 3.4). The short conductor length between vacuum feedthrough and resonator coil also
permits efficient thermal coupling to the trap which is advantageous if its temperature is to be
stabilised.
Due to stray capacitances, non-negligible RF currents at the trap drive frequency are picked up
by the compensation and outer trap electrodes. Since these electrodes are to be kept at pure DC
potentials, the RF currents must be absorbed through capacitors that provide a negligible impedance
between the electrodes and the vacuum chamber. Another requirement that applies in particular to
the outer trap electrodes is that EMI-induced and Johnson-noise voltages in the range of the secular
frequencies must be suppressed to a high degree. This can be achieved by low-pass filter circuits
that are mounted close to the feedthroughs of the vacuum chamber as indicated in Figure 3.4.
The schematic of a low-pass filter suitable for the outer trap electrodes is shown in Figure 3.5.
The cascading of two RC circuits yields an AC-voltage attenuation factor ≥3 × 108 (corresponding
to 170-dB power attenuation) at frequencies ≥0.5 MHz. The parallel connection of two capacitors

at the output improves the attenuation at frequencies ≥10 MHz where it is dominated by the
effective series resistance of the capacitors. The 3-dB corner frequency of the filter shown in
Figure 3.5 is 15 Hz, and above 50 Hz the power attenuation increases by 40 dB per decade. The
scheme shown in Figure 3.5 is also suitable for the compensation electrodes. Here a reduced
capacitance value around 0.1 µF may be sufficient, which leads to a proportional increase in corner
frequency. As an alternative to the filter shown in Figure 3.5, LCR Pi filters can be employed to
obtain a steep resonant increase in attenuation at a defined frequency (Allcock, 2011).

3.3

Traps developed in OC18

As part of the OC18 project, single-ion traps were developed in four separate institutes: CMI,
NPL, PTB and VTT MIKES. In each case, the endcap electrodes were made from molybdenum
and their geometry was based on the design shown in Figure 3.3(a). The way the electrodes were
mounted, however, showed a greater variety. At NPL and VTT MIKES, the electrode mounting
closely followed that described in Nisbet-Jones et al. (2016). At PTB, the design was modified to
enable more robust alignment of the electrodes, while at CMI greater consideration was given to
minimising the heating in the trap structure. More details of these modified designs are given in the
following Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.

3.3.1

Endcap trap with self-aligned electrodes (PTB)

For investigations that involve cleaning or coating of the trap electrodes, a trap design is desirable
that permits reproducible repositioning of the electrodes without manual alignment. To achieve this,
the positions of the electrodes must be uniquely determined by their mechanical contact with the
trap mount and insulation elements, and a machining accuracy around 0.01 mm must be maintained
for all critical dimensions. The mechanical design must be compatible with vacuum baking at a
temperature up to 250 ◦C.
The trap shown in Figure 3.6 satisfies these conditions. Its electrodes have the shape shown
in Figure 3.3(a) and are machined from Mo with mechanically polished inner-electrode end faces.
With the dimensions 2r = 0.8 mm, 2r1 = 1.2 mm, 2r2 = 1.6 mm, 2r3 = 3.6 mm and 2d = 0.86
mm, 2d1 = 1.26 mm, 2d2 = 3.22 mm, the lowest-order anharmonic component of the trap potential
is suppressed and the efficiency factor is η = 0.66. The trap electrodes are held in an arc-shaped
mount made from a CuCrZr alloy that is considerably harder than pure copper (Cu) and can be

machined to a high precision. The mount provides a symmetric connection of the inner electrodes
to the trap drive voltage. The trap is held in the vacuum chamber by attaching the mount to the
massive Cu conductor (diameter 6 mm) of a high-power vacuum feedthrough.
As shown in Figure 3.6(b), the position of the inner trap electrodes is defined by a thread and
a well-defined contact area with the trap mount. The position of the outer electrodes relative to
the inner electrodes is defined by insulating spacer rings cut from UV-grade-fused-silica optical
substrates (Edmund Optics #47-833). The low parallelism error (5 arcsec) of the original substrates
is essential for reaching the required centring accuracy of the end faces of the inner and outer
trap electrodes. The outer trap electrodes are clamped down on the spacer rings by flat springs
made from a CuBe alloy with high yield strength. The end of each spring is held between two
unmodified fused-silica substrates. Copper strips spot-welded to the springs provide electrical
connection of the outer trap electrodes to vacuum feedthroughs. Figure 3.6(c) shows an SEM
(scanning-electron-microscope) image of the assembled trap electrodes.
The heating of the trap electrodes due to dielectric loss in the fused-silica spacers was investigated by operating the trap at Vrf ≈ 1000 V in a vacuum of 10−3 mbar. Thermal radiation
in the wavelength range near the spectral maximum of room-temperature blackbody radiation
(λ ≈ 10 µm) was observed with a bolometric camera through a ZnSe window. A typical camera
image is shown in Figure 3.7. The thermal radiation that is registered from the largest part of the
trap mount and from the outer trap electrodes is not related to the blackbody emission of these
parts but originates from partly diffuse reflection of ambient heat sources. Despite this, Figure 3.7
indicates a negligible temperature rise of the fused-silica spacers that are used to fix the outer trap
electrodes. The temperature of the spacers between outer and inner trap electrodes is difficult to
determine because their emission is partly masked by reflections from the outer trap electrodes. It
seems likely that their temperature rise relative to the trap mount is smaller than 0.5 ◦C.
The anomalous heating rate of the secular motion of a trapped ion was determined by observation of Rabi oscillations on the λ = 436 nm reference transition of a Doppler-cooled 171 Yb+ ion.
The delay time between the end of the cooling and the start of the Rabi oscillations was varied, and
the increase in the damping rate of the Rabi oscillations resulting from heating-induced dephasing
was evaluated (Letchumanan et al., 2004). The measurement was performed under conditions where
the axial secular freqency was ωz /2π ≈ 1.2 MHz and radial and axial secular modes contributed

measurement uncertainty. The red line is a linear fit to the data points.

approximately equally to the observed heating rate. The result of this measurement is shown in
Figure 3.8 and indicates an effective heating rate n̄˙ = 46(11) s−1 . If the

distributed equally between the three secular oscillation modes, n̄˙ ≈ n̄˙ x / 2 ≈ n̄˙ y / 2 ≈ 2n̄˙ z / 2. In
a separate investigation of a similarly sized trap with Mo electrodes at NPL, a comparable heating
rate magnitude was observed (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2016).

3.3.2

Endcap trap with minimised blackbody radiation (CMI)

The main objective in the design of this trap was to minimise additional sources of blackbody
radiation. Additional design considerations were (i) to obtain a very wide optical access for
laser beams and fluorescence detection, (ii) to use a single vacuum feedthrough for all electrical
connections and (iii) to minimise distortions of the trap field imperfections caused by the connections
of the trap electrodes to the trap drive voltage.
The trap and its mounting on a custom-made vacuum feedthrough are shown in Figure 3.9. The
setup can be placed between two vacuum-chamber windows that are separated by only 20 mm,
which is favourable for obtaining a large optical access angle. The trap drive voltage is applied to

the massive central copper conductor (6 mm diameter) of the vacuum feedtrough. On the vacuum
side, this conductor is attached to a rectangular frame that is machined from Cu. The frame holds
the inner trap electrodes. The outer trap electrodes are supported by an interior frame (also Cu) that
is kept at ground potential. In this frame, the outer trap and compensation electrodes are mounted
on fused-silica spacers. The inner frame is held in the outer frame by fused-silica tubes. Only
these insulators are exposed to the high electric field caused by the trap drive voltage, and their
geometry minimises dielectric loss and heating. In addition, there is no direct line of sight between
the fused-silica tubes and trap centre so that a trapped ion is well shielded from their blackbody
radiation.
The trap electrode configuration is shown in Figure 3.10. The trap electrodes are machined
from Mo and their geometry corresponds to the design described in Nisbet-Jones et al. (2016),
which yields an efficiency factor η ≈ 0.88. The Yb atoms used for loading the trap are evaporated
from a commercially available Yb dispenser (AlfaSource by AlfaVakuo e.U. (2018), on the far right
in Figure 3.9) and are passed to the trap through the attached fused-silica tube.
The employed custom-made vacuum feedthrough is shown in Figure 3.11. Since it is based on a
large alumina ceramic disc, the capacitance between the central conductor and the other conductors
and the mounting flange is much smaller than that of standard vacuum feedthroughs. With this
design also the dielectric load of the insulator material is strongly reduced so that heat dissipation
is expected to be negligible for Vrf . 1000 V.
The helical resonator that is attached to the central conductor of the vacuum feedthrough is
shown in Figure 3.12. The design of the resonator addresses the problem that typically a power of
up to several watts is dissipated in the resonator coil, which can lead to a substantial increase of
the temperature of the trap electrodes and vacuum chamber. The double-helix (bifilar) coil of the
resonator shown in Figure 3.12 is made of Cu tubes so that cooling water can be circulated without
resistive or dielectric loss. With active stabilisation of the cooling water temperature, it is possible
to keep the trap electrodes at a well-defined temperature.

Summary

When designing single-ion traps for use in optical clocks, there are many issues that must be
considered. These include factors that affect how well the ion can be cooled and how the heating
rate can be kept at a minimum. Effects that lead to clock frequency shifts must also be minimised,

This chapter summarises the effects of background-gas collisions, lattice-photon scattering and
parametric heating in neutral-atom optical lattice clocks. All three processes can have a detrimental
effect on the clock frequency stability and must be mitigated through careful control of the vacuum
pressure and the trap depth and by avoiding fluctuations in the trapping potential.

4.1

Background collisions in optical lattice clocks

An established way of evaluating the effect of thermal background-gas collisions in optical lattice
clocks is to measure the trap lifetime (Gibble, 2013a; McGrew et al., 2018) and take advantage
of theoretically determined coefficients. Therefore, the uncertainty related to the background-gas
collisions heavily depends on the quality of the theoretical calculations. As shown by Gibble
(2013a), clock-atom losses as well as the collisional shift of the clock transition are governed by
long-range interactions which can be approximated by a van der Waals potential. Therefore, it is
crucial to determine the C6 coefficients for the interaction between the clock atoms and the colliding
atoms or molecules. While literature data is available for Sr–Sr and Yb–Yb interactions, such data
did not exist for Sr–H2 or Yb–H2 interactions, in particular not for the 3 P0 excited clock states in Sr
and Yb.
The missing C6 coefficients can be estimated from interaction potential energy surfaces (PESs)
for Sr–H2 and Yb–H2 interactions in the electronic ground state as well as in the excited 3 P state.
These PESs were determined for the first time by Cybulski (2019). A series expansion in terms of
spherical harmonics depending on the angle between the clock-atom–H2 axis and the H–H axis
of the H2 molecule is commonly used for representing the PES. The calculated intermolecular
potential-energy curves for the ground and the first excited states of the Yb–H2 and Sr–H2 complexes
are shown in Figures 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.
Only the isotropic potentials were used to estimate the C6 coefficients. To determine the
particular C6 coefficient the isotropic potential is multiplied by r6 and a plateau between the shortrange and long-range parts of the potential is found. In the short-range part the interaction does not
have a van der Waals character and in the long-range part the errors of the ab initio calculations
are large in comparison to the value of the potential. A similar approach was used to determine
the C6 coefficient near the asymptotes where Sr and Yb atoms are excited to the 3 P states. The

(Me = Sr, Yb) complexes for the collinear (a-c) and T-shape (d-f) configurations. From Cybulski (2019).

C6 coefficients were calculated for the isotropic parts of the PES in the A1, B1 and B2 electronic
states. The A1, B1 and B2 nomenclature is used for the T-shape geometry. In the case of the A1
surface, the p-orbital is directed towards the hydrogen molecule, Figures 4.3(a) and (d), whilst in
the case of the B1 surface the p-orbital is perpendicular to the complex symmetry plane, Figures
4.3(b) and (e). The B2 surface corresponds to the third situation, where the p-orbital is neither
perpendicular to the complex symmetry plane nor directed towards the H2 dimer, Figures 4.3(c) and
(f). To estimate the C6 coefficients near the Sr(3 P0 )–H2 and Yb(3 P0 )–H2 asymptotes that involve the
excited 3 P0 clock state, it is necessary to use an averaged coefficient [C6 (A1) +C6 (B1) +C6 (B2)] /3.
The uncertainty of the C6 coefficients determined in this way was estimated to be about 10%.
The C6 coefficients necessary for the evaluation of the background-collision effects in Yb and
Sr optical lattice clocks are summarised in Table 4.1. These coefficients allow the ratio of the
relative collisional shift ∆νbg /ν0 and the collisional loss rate of clock atoms Γbg to be calculated.
These ratios are presented in Section 5.2.2. The collisional loss rate due to collisions with H2 can
be extracted from the trap lifetime at a given vacuum pressure. As an example, for Sr atoms the
dependence of the loss rate (defined as the inverse of the 1/e trap lifetime) on the vacuum pressure
is equal to
Γbg = 4.31(98) × 108 s−1 P [mbar].

Off-resonant scattering of lattice-laser radiation by 87 Sr atoms in the two states 1 S0 and 3 P0
causes decoherence of the atomic superposition state during interrogation and population redistribution between electronic, fine- and hyperfine-structure, and Zeeman states. This will lead to a
degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio and thus the frequency stability of the clock, and potentially
to systematic frequency shifts, e.g., by line pulling. Observation of a resulting loss of contrast
at long interrogation times has recently been reported for Ramsey spectroscopy (Schioppo et al.,
2017; Marti et al., 2018).
Figure 4.4 schematically illustrates the different types of photon-scattering processes at the
lattice wavelength, all of which are off-resonant. Inelastic scattering events changing the internal

unchanged as Rayleigh scattering.

Figure 4.5. Measured populations (a) in the metastable states 3 P0,2 and (b) in the ground state 1 S0 for
samples prepared in the excited state at different effective lattice depths U as a function of hold time th .
Results of a combined fit of a rate-equation model are shown as coloured lines. The inset in (a) shows the
fraction of atoms in the ground state as derived from this model. For reference, the solid black line shows the
decay of ground-state samples. From Dörscher et al. (2018).

Raman scattering 3 P0 → 3 P1 is followed by radiative decay to the ground state, since the state
3 P has a lifetime of about 21 µs (Nicholson et al., 2015). The atom is typically not lost from the
1
optical lattice after such a decay process. In contrast, Raman scattering 3 P0 → 3 P2 leaves atoms
shelved in the metastable state 3 P2 , which has an effective lifetime on the order of 100 s at room
temperature due to blackbody radiation (Yasuda and Katori, 2004).
The decay rate 3 P0 → 1 S0 is experimentally investigated by measuring the populations in each
of the two clock states as a function of hold time in the trap. Lattice-induced scattering to the state
3 P is determined by varying the depth of the optical lattice, since its rate is proportional to the
1
intensity of the lattice laser field. The atoms are prepared in the substate mF = 9/2 of the excited
state and in the lowest two axial vibrational states of the lattice. Population in any other state is
removed from the trap by the preparation sequence. The sample is held in the optical lattice for a
variable amount of time th . Finally, the populations in the ground state 1 S0 and in the metastable
states 3 P0 and 3 P2 are destructively detected. For each hold time th and lattice potential depth U0 ,
the populations Ng in 1 S0 and Ne in 3 P0,2 are averaged over typically thirty to forty samples. In
order to reject long-term fluctuations of the initial number of atoms, the populations are also divided
by the total population found in reference measurements with th = 1 s, performed before and after
each set of measurements, for normalisation.
This detection scheme can neither resolve any magnetic substates nor distinguish the metastable
states 3 P0 and 3 P2 , because the atoms are repumped via the intermediate state 3 P1 by driving the
transitions 3 P0,2 → 3 S1 . Therefore, only lattice-induced decay to the ground state (see Figure 4.4)
can be studied experimentally in this scheme, whereas the lattice-induced population redistribution
over the Zeeman and hyperfine states of the metastable 3 P states cannot be resolved.
Decay 3 P0 → 1 S0 is clearly observed, as, in addition to enhanced losses in the excited state,
atoms emerge in the ground state (Figure 4.5). The population in the ground state becomes
substantial after several seconds, especially for deep lattice potentials.
A quantitative analysis of these measurements is provided by the time evolution of the two

which describe lattice-independent losses from the trap at different rates, Γbg and Γ0bg , as well

The off-resonant scattering rates of lattice-laser radiation can also be calculated from atomic data
in order to investigate the other processes shown in Figure 4.4 to which this experiment is not
sensitive.
The rate Γi→ f , at which an atom in an initial state i off-resonantly scatters linearly polarised
incoming radiation with intensity I and is transferred to a final state f , is given by the Kramers–

polarisation state of the scattered radiation in spherical tensor notation, where the polarisation axis
of the incoming light is used as quantation axis. The sum is over all intermediate states k, and ωki
is the frequency of the transition i → k.
The matrix elements of the dipole operator can be related to Einstein coefficients using tensoralgebraic expressions (Dörscher et al., 2018). The scattering rates are calculated according to
Equation (4.5) using line strengths as discussed in the supplement to Middelmann et al. (2012a)
and including those reported by Nicholson et al. (2015) for the (4d5s) 3 D states and by Sansonetti
and Nave (2010) for the state (5s6s) 3 S1 .
The calculated rates of all Rayleigh- and Raman-scattering processes of laser radiation at the
magic wavelength near 813 nm that occur for 87 Sr atoms are summarised in Table 4.2. Interestingly,
the elastic scattering amplitudes of the two states 1 S0 and 3 P0 used in lattice clocks are necessarily
equal at any magic wavelength. As damping of coherences by Rayleigh scattering depends on the
difference of the elastic scattering amplitudes (Uys et al., 2010), no loss of coherence is expected
from this effect.
The two Raman scattering processes 3 P0 → 3 P1,2 result in decoherence of the atomic superposition state as well as depopulation of the excited state 3 P0 . They do not cause systematic
62

frequency shifts directly, as they are not sensitive to the phase of the superposition state. However,
the maximum slope of the spectroscopic signal is reduced. In Ramsey spectroscopy, these effects
manifest themselves as a reduction of fringe contrast if the duration of an excitation pulse is small
compared to the inverse scattering rate. For Rabi spectroscopy using a single, long pulse, the line
shape is modified more intricately; it is broadened, but remains symmetric with respect to the
detuning of the interrogation laser from resonance.
The resulting populations in the states 3 P2 and 1 S0 themselves may also disturb an optical
lattice clock. In particular, atoms having decayed to the ground state are highly susceptible to
the interrogation laser. Our calculations show that lattice-induced decay to the ground state most
likely returns an atom to the magnetic sublevel mF = ±9/2 (Table 4.2). The consequences on
spectroscopy are quite similar to those of decoherence and depopulation of the superposition
state. For Ramsey spectroscopy, the atoms having decayed during the free evolution time are
resonantly excited by the final π/2-pulse, resulting in reduced fringe contrast. For the case of Rabi
spectroscopy with long excitation pulses, coherently driving the reference transition in those atoms
after decay modifies the line shape further. Likewise, this degrades the slope of the error signal and,
in some cases, the observable linewidth, but does not give rise to systematic frequency shifts. In
contrast, population of the other magnetic substates (mF 6= ±9/2) in the ground state can cause
line pulling if the laser detuning is varied to derive an error signal.
Last but not least, atoms that are incoherently transferred to different states by Raman scattering
may cause systematic shifts of the transition frequency by disturbing the remaining atoms. For
instance, interactions with atoms in the original superposition state at the same lattice site are
generally no longer suppressed by the Pauli principle and lead to collision-induced systematic
frequency shifts at high atom density.

Design of a lattice trap with low parametric heating rate

In any accurate atomic clock it is essential to have precise control over the motion of the atomic
reference in order to avoid large uncertainties in the Doppler and recoil shifts. In the case of
an optical lattice clock, the motion is controlled firstly by laser cooling the atomic sample to a

substate mF = 9/2 of the state i. The final state of the the atom is denoted by f with hyperfine and magnetic
quantum numbers F 0 and m0F , respectively. Rates are given for an intensity corresponding to an optical dipole

temperature of a few µK, and secondly by trapping the atoms in a magic-wavelength optical lattice
during the clock interrogation (Ye et al., 2008). The role of the optical lattice trap is to “freeze out”
the Doppler and recoil shifts in the Lamb–Dicke regime, where each atom is tightly confined to a
single lattice site to within a region much smaller than the wavelength of the probe laser (Wineland
and Itano, 1979). However, for this technique to be effective, the atoms must remain cold and
trapped in the lattice for long enough to carry out clock interrogation.
In this section some of the key design considerations for building a lattice trap with a sufficiently
long lifetime and low heating rate for an optical lattice clock are described. Some of the important
features of the cavity-enhanced lattice trap built at NPL, which lead to parametric heating rates
below 0.1 quanta/s, are described.

4.3.1

Scaling laws for parametric heating

Parametric heating is caused by instability in shape and depth of the lattice potential, which can
resonantly excite the atoms into higher-energy motional states. Generally the heating rate scales
with the square of the motional frequency, so in a 1D lattice the rate is typically much faster in the
axial direction (νz ≈ 5 × 104 Hz) than in the radial direction (νρ ≈ 102 Hz). In this section, results
from Savard et al. (1997) are applied to calculate rough targets for realising a trap with low heating
rates.
The first cause of heating is from vibrations in the position of the trap. In the case of a 1D
optical lattice, the position of each lattice site can move either due to vibrations of the mirror used
to reflect the lattice beam, or due to frequency noise on the lattice laser which has the effect of
wobbling the relative phase of the incident and retroreflected beams. In the approximation of each
lattice site as a harmonic potential with motional frequency νz along the lattice axis, the rate of
change of motional energy hEi from site position instability is given by

(4.7)

where z2 is the mean-square spread of atoms in the axial direction on a single lattice site and
Sz (νz ) is the power spectral density (PSD) of lattice-site position fluctuations at frequency νz .
To derive the second identity in Equation (4.7), two separate contributions are considered —
one from physical mirror vibrations and the other from laser frequency noise — and for this purpose
the PSD of mirror position fluctuations is given by Smirror (νz ) and the PSD of lattice laser frequency
fluctuations by SνL (νz ). In Equation (4.7), d is the distance of the atoms from the retroreflecting
mirror and νL is the lattice-laser optical frequency. The physical mirror vibrations are usually
negligible under laboratory conditions since the relevant Fourier frequencies νz ≈ 5 × 104 Hz tend
not to be easily excited by the environment and are well damped by the inertia of the mirror.
However, heating from laser frequency noise can be a problem if combining a relatively broad laser
source (e.g., a MHz-linewidth DFB) with long lattice propagation distances of several 100 mm: to
avoid this effect, it is helpful if the laser linewidth is narrow (e.g., from a titanium-sapphire laser or
extended-cavity diode laser) or if the mirror distance from atoms is kept to a few 10 mm.
The second heating effect, and often the dominant one, is from fluctuations in the depth of the
lattice potential caused by intensity noise on the trapping light. These intensity fluctuations can
excite (or de-excite) the atoms in units of two motional quanta, with a transition rate Rn±2←n given
by

where Sε (2νz ) is the PSD of fractional intensity fluctuations, where the peak trap intensity is

with a motional frequency of 65 kHz, and targeting a transition
0.1 quanta/s,

Equation (4.8) implies a required fractional intensity noise of Sε (2νz ) < 10 Hz
.

4.3.2

Design of an in-vacuum lattice enhancement cavity with low heating rates

In order to achieve a systematic uncertainty below 10−17 in an optical lattice clock, there are several
reasons to use an enhancement cavity to generate the lattice trap:
• The cavity cleans up the radial mode profile of the lattice beam into a near-ideal Gaussian,
giving a more reliable basis to apply detailed theoretical models of the atomic motion (Blatt
et al., 2009) and high-order lattice shifts (Brown et al., 2017; Katori et al., 2015).
• The running-wave component of the lattice beam is eliminated by the cavity, avoiding firstorder contributions from electric-quadrupole and magnetic-dipole lattice shifts, and therefore
eliminating retroreflector beam-pointing instability as a possible source of systematic error.
• The power build-up factor, related to the cavity finesse as F /π, enables the use of larger
lattice beam waists — and therefore larger trap volume — while still achieving the same
peak intensity. This reduces the density shift for a fixed trap depth and atom number, and
also enables more efficient capture of atoms from the final stage of cooling.
• The cavity reduces the amount of laser light needed to generate the same depth of trap,
therefore reducing the (often unstable) Stark shift from amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)
incident on the atoms — an especially important consideration when using semiconductor
laser sources.
However, the cavity presents a significant technical challenge: it has to be possible to couple a
stable amount of lattice power into the TEM00 cavity mode, otherwise intensity fluctuations will
parametrically heat the atoms out of the lattice trap. In practice the main difficulty is in locking
the laser to the cavity to within much less than the cavity linewidth, in order to avoid conversion
of lattice-laser frequency noise into fluctuations of cavity-coupled power — i.e., to avoid FM
to AM conversion. To make this task easier, it helps (i) to make both the cavity and the lattice
laser as intrinsically stable as possible, and (ii) to use a cavity with a relatively broad linewidth
∆νFWHM = νFSR /F , ideally at least a few MHz. In general, a shorter enhancement cavity helps
because the linewidth is larger for a given finesse, and because more compact spacers tend to have
reduced sensitivity to vibrations.
To minimise the cavity length and maximise the mechanical stability, a monolithic in-vacuum
cavity like in Figure 4.6 is an effective solution. The cavity has a finesse of 6000, a length of
35.9 mm, and a mirror radius of curvature of 10 cm, resulting in a lattice waist of 100 µm at the
centre of the cavity where atoms are trapped. The design has been incorporated into the NPL
Sr lattice clock and supports a lattice lifetime of 27 s with negligible parametric heating of less
than 70 nK/s.
These results show that it is possible to achieve good trap lifetime and low heating rates with a
moderately high-finesse in-vacuum cavity, but there are a handful of further considerations to bear
in mind for an accurate optical lattice clock. Firstly, with in-vacuum optics placed near the atoms
there is a danger that stray electric fields from patch charges on the mirrors will cause DC Stark
shifts at the 10−14 level. To mitigate this possibility, two precautions have been taken in the NPL
design: (i) the shear piezos for cavity length tuning are actually formed of a two-layer stack, with
the high-voltage electrode sandwiched in the middle between grounded electrodes top and bottom.
This shields the electric field generated by the high-voltage electrode, and also ensures that the
surrounding spacer and optics are all contacted to ground; (ii) in-vacuum cages are installed around
the cavity mirrors and connected electrically to a vacuum feedthrough, both providing shielding

mirrors for a pyramid MOT. Right: Photo of the partially completed assembly, before the installation of
electrodes or the CaF2 prism. Note: the two pairs of cavity mirrors form two separate cavities, but only one
of those cavities is actually used for the optical lattice clock.

for any patch charges on the mirrors, and also allowing the application of large electric fields for
DC-Stark-shift evaluation. With these precautions in place, a small residual background electric
field from stray charges is still observed, but only enough to cause a relatively benign DC Stark
shift of 2 × 10−18 .
A second design consideration is that all materials for the cavity and spacer should, if possible,
be non-magnetic to avoid perturbation when switching the magnetic coils needed for the MOT
cooling stages. In our case the cavity spacer, screws and most of the vacuum chamber are made
from titanium, the piezo electrodes are a copper-beryllium alloy, and any electrically isolating
spacers or shims are ceramic.
In future lattice clock work, there are a handful of minor modifications to the NPL design which
could be recommended: (i) the inclusion of a thin damping Viton spacer in the chamber mount in
order to avoid transmission of kHz acoustic vibrations onto the cavity; (ii) a reduction in the finesse
of the cavity to realise a roughly 2-MHz linewidth for reduced FM to AM conversion; (iii) the use
of finite-element modelling to optimise the spacer and its in-vacuum mount for reduced sensitivity
to vibrations; (iv) the omission of the second pair of cavity mirrors to simplify assembly; (v) the
replacement of the silver-coated glass pyramid-MOT mirrors with an aluminium substrate, which
would be easier to machine, would have higher thermal conductivity for improved homogeneity of
the blackbody-radiation environment, and would be electrically conductive for guaranteeing low
DC Stark shifts.

This chapter considers the optical-lattice-induced light shifts and the collisional shifts relevant
for optical lattice clocks. Section 5.1 starts with an overview of the lattice light shift and then
summarises the evaluation of relevant parameters for different atom species, mainly strontium and
ytterbium. The discussion of the collisional shifts is divided into cold collisions between clock
atoms (Section 5.2.1) and collisions with hot background-gas atoms (Section 5.2.2).

5.1

Lattice light shifts

The lattice light shift is induced by the lattice light used to confine the atoms in the Lamb–Dicke
regime. At the so-called magic wavelength (Katori et al., 2003) for the lattice light, the electric
dipole shift is the same, to leading order, for the excited and ground clock states, thus effectively
suppressing the light shift. However, this suppression may only be partial due to several effects:
• A possible deviation of the lattice frequency from the magic wavelength.
• Effects that depend on the polarisation of the trapping light for species with a non-zero spin.
• Higher-order terms in the expansion of the interaction between the lattice light and the atoms,
namely magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interactions.
• Multi-photon processes, among which the dominant contribution is the hyper-polarisability.
• The finite expansion of the atomic wave function, determined by the atomic temperature, that
results in a modification of the light shift.
All the effects mentioned above can be summarised in the following general expression of
the frequency shift δ ν that takes into account the dominant electric dipole (E1) interaction as
well as the electric quadrupole (E2) and the magnetic dipole (M1) interactions, via the atomic
polarisabilities αE1 , αM1 and αE2 , and also hyper-polarisability effects via the coefficient β

where αs , αv and αt are the scalar, vector and tensor polarisabilities, respectively, νl is the lattice

light frequency, νl
is the true magic frequency cancelling the differential scalar polarisability,
F is the total spin of the clock states, ξ = ||iεε ∧ ε ∗ || is the degree of polarisation of the lattice light,
and ez is the quantisation axis, effectively realised by a strong static bias magnetic field. Shi et al.
(2015) details the suitable treatment of the vector and tensor shifts in the practical case where the
strength of the bias magnetic field is not considered infinite. It results in a quadratic dependence of
the E1 light shift on the trap depth that does not impair the clock accuracy.
In Equation (5.1), U denotes the depth of the trapping potential, which can be expressed as
a function of the local intensity I(r) of the trapping light as U(r) = αE1 I(r). It is a quantity that
varies with space according to the intensity profile of the laser light and reaches its maximum U0
at the position of constructive interference in the lattice. When evaluating this potential, several
critical aspects have to be included:
• The lattice light shift does not directly depend on the maximum trap depth U0 at the maximum
intensity of the optical lattice, but rather on the effective trap depth hUi averaged over the
spatial profile of the atomic wave function, because this wave function extends over regions
of space for which the lattice intensity is lower than the maximum intensity. This average
depends on the temperature of the atoms in the optical lattice or, in an equivalent way, on the
average vibrational quantum numbers n in the three dimensions of space. To correctly handle
this effect, one has to express the lattice light shift of Equation (5.1) for given longitudinal
and transverse vibrational quantum numbers, and then average the atomic distribution over
these levels. This treatment is developed in (Katori et al., 2015; Ovsiannikov et al., 2016;
Brown et al., 2017). Alternatively, and equivalently, one can simply use Equation (5.1) with
the average trap depth given by the maximum trap depth U0 reduced by the thermal energy

Here Tr is the temperature of the atoms in the transverse direction. Note that the E2/M1 term
in Equation (5.1) only involves the transverse average trap depth hUir = U0 − kB Tr . The
intuitive reason for this is that in the longitudinal direction, the E2/M1 effects are stronger as
the atoms explore large regions.
• The parameters U0 , Tr and Tz∗ that appear in Equation (5.3) can be accurately measured by
motional-sideband spectroscopy of the clock transition of the atoms in the optical lattice. The
frequency of the longitudinal sidebands gives the maximum trap depth U0 , the ratio between
the intensity of the blue and red sidebands yields Tz∗ , and the width of the sidebands relates
to Tr through the anharmonicity of the optical lattice (Le Targat, 2007). Alternatively, the
temperature of the atoms can be directly deduced from a measurement of the lattice light
shift (McDonald et al., 2015).
• In practice, because of the way the atoms are cooled in the optical lattice, which may include
adiabatic cooling by ramping the lattice depth, the temperature of the atoms depends on the
68

OC18

5. Understanding and controlling light and collisional shifts in optical lattice clocks

maximum lattice trap depth U0 . Because of this, the various terms in Equation (5.1), giving
δ ν as a power series of the trapping potential, are effectively intermixed when one fits the
clock frequency as a function of the maximum trap depth U0 (Brown et al., 2017). In other
words, the difference between the average trap depth hUi and the maximum trap depth U0
depends on U0 .
• The motional quantum numbers used in Equation (5.1) hold for a harmonic trap. In practice,
the optical lattice is an anharmonic sine wave in the longitudinal direction and a Gaussian
profile in the transverse direction. This induces anharmonicity in both the z and r directions,
with terms z4 and r4 , but also a coupling z2 r2 . These anharmonic terms have to be included
in the treatment of the lattice light shift as their impact is not negligible at the level of the best
accuracy of optical lattice clocks. Evaluating the light shift from Equations (5.1) and (5.3)
effectively takes into account the critical anharmonicities.
Evaluating the lattice light shift requires knowledge of the various polarisabilities involved in
Equations (5.1) and (5.2). They can be found in the literature (see the next sections for specific
values), or evaluated locally by measuring the clock frequency as a function of the trap depth. A
proper combination of the various polarisabilities shifting the clock transition can be used to operate
lattice clocks at a point for which the light shift is null and insensitive to the lattice power over a
large range. This scheme was proposed in Katori et al. (2015).
Equation (5.2) shows the dependence of the lattice light shift on the lattice polarisation. The
vector term is proportional to mF such that it is cancelled by averaging the clock frequency over
resonances with opposite mF , as is done to cancel the first-order Zeeman effect. The tensor
component vanishes for atoms with F < 1, such as 171Yb, 199Hg, and 88Sr. For 87Sr, a proper
evaluation of this effect must be considered (see the next section).
In the optical lattice, tunnelling between the sites may induce a frequency shift due to the band
structure associated with the period structure of the lattice. For a trap depth U0 = 50 Er , this shift is
as large as 6 × 10−16 . It can, however, be effectively suppressed by using a vertical lattice because
in this configuration, the gravitational energy splits the degeneracy between the energy levels of
adjacent sites (Lemonde and Wolf, 2005).
Another source of light shift may arise from the incoherent background of the laser source used
to generate the optical lattice. It has been observed with semiconductor sources (laser diodes and
tapered amplifiers), leading to frequency shifts as large as 10−15 (Le Targat et al., 2013). While
proper filtering of the laser source using narrow interference filters or Bragg gratings can reduce
the effect to 10−17 (Bilicki, 2017), the best suppressions to below 10−18 have been reported with
titanium-sapphire lasers (Lodewyck et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2017).

Evaluation for strontium

For 87Sr the magic wavelength, cancelling the scalar part of the E1 differential polarisability, has
magic
been experimentally evaluated to be νl
= 368 554 725(3) MHz (Shi et al., 2015; Campbell
et al., 2017). The difference between the magic wavelengths of 88Sr and 87Sr is published in Takano
et al. (2017). Unlike 88Sr, 87Sr has a spin F = 9/2 ≥ 1 such that a tensor shift adds to the scalar
shift, effectively displacing the wavelength at which the E1 contribution vanishes. The tensor shift
has been experimentally measured in Westergaard et al. (2011) to be

confirmed by a theoretical evaluation (Shi et al., 2015). If the polarisation of the lattice light
is fluctuating, the lattice light shift will fluctuate accordingly. This fluctuation is extremal for a
lattice polarisation parallel or orthogonal to the quantisation axis. In the case where the angle θ

between these two axes is small and fluctuates by δ θ , the clock accuracy is better than 10−18 if
θ δ θ < 5 × 10−4 rad2 , which can be achieved in practice. The tensor shift prevents a simple 3D
optical lattice clock from being realised, as the polarisation cannot be identical for three orthogonal
beams due to the transverse nature of electromagnetic fields. This can be circumvented by detuning
the frequency of one of the lattice beams (Westergaard et al., 2011; Campbell et al., 2017).
The vector light shift for 87Sr has been experimentally and theoretically evaluated in Westergaard et al. (2011); Shi et al. (2015). The sensitivity of the linear light shift to the lattice-light
frequency has been experimentally measured to be (Shi et al., 2015; Middelmann et al., 2012a;

The hyper-polarisability coefficient has been experimentally evaluated in Le Targat et al. (2013,
2012) to be −∆β /hαs2 = 0.45(10) µHz/Er2 and in Ushijima et al. (2018) to be −∆β /hαs2 =
0.461(14) µHz/Er2 . Looser experimental upper bounds were also published in Westergaard et al.
(2011) and Nicholson et al. (2015). These values agree with a recent theoretical evaluation (Porsev
et al., 2018). For a typical trap depth of 70 Er , the effect amounts to 5.3(2) × 10−18 .
An upper bound for the E2/M1 effect was experimentally evaluated in Westergaard et al. (2011)
as |∆αM1 + ∆αE2 |/αE1 < 10−7 , and a recent theoretical evaluation also falls within this bound
(Porsev et al., 2018). In a separate experiment (Ushijima et al., 2018), the E2/M1 effect in Sr
was also evaluated and found to be a little larger and with opposite sign from Porsev et al. (2018),
(∆αM1 + ∆αE2 )/αE1 = −2.77(12) × 10−7 . For U0 = 70 Er , these results suggest a maximum shift
at the level of mid to high parts in 1018 , but this can be further reduced by using lower trap depths,
or with a refined evaluation of the coefficient.

5.1.2

Evaluation for ytterbium

The magic wavelength for 171Yb is approximatively at 759.4 nm, a wavelength easily accessible by
magic
titanium-sapphire lasers. The most accurate determinations of the magic frequency are νl
=
magic
= 394 798 267(1) MHz by Brown et al.
394 798 265(9) MHz by Nemitz et al. (2016) and νl
(2017).
The linear dependence of the scalar shift around the magic wavelength is approximatively
21 mHz/(GHz Er ) (Nemitz et al., 2016; Pizzocaro et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2017). For example,
for a trap depth of 100Er , this implies that the lattice frequency has to be locked at <0.3 MHz to
make the changes in the light shift <1 × 10−18 .
Unlike 87Sr, 171Yb has nuclear spin 1/2 so that the tensor shift is identically zero (Angel
and Sandars, 1968). The clock transition in 171Yb is separated into two mF = ±1/2 Zeeman
resonances. With the external magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice direction, the Zeeman
and vector shifts of the two resonances are summed in quadrature. The vector light shift can
be suppressed to <1 × 10−18 by a combination of three methods (Lemke et al., 2009): using a
1D lattice, using linear polarisation (ξ ≈ 0) and averaging over the two mF = ±1/2 resonances.
Lemke et al. (2009) measured the vector shift by measuring the splitting between the mF = ±1/2
resonances as a function of the lattice polarisation ellipticity, determining a maximum shift of
220(30) Hz at U0 = 500 Er . Assuming hUi/U0 = 0.7(1) for their measurement, this translates to
∆αv /(hαE1 ) = −0.6(1) Hz/Er .
The hyperpolarisability in Yb arises from the presence of three two-photon resonances near the
magic wavelength (Barber et al., 2008), see Figure 5.1. Two of these show hyperfine splitting in
the case of 171Yb. The one closest to the magic wavelength is the 6s6p 3 P0 → 6s8p 3 P0 resonance
at 394 615 300 MHz, about −184 GHz from the magic wavelength (detuning given as singlephoton). Then there are two hyperfine components of the 6s6p 3 P0 → 6s5f 3 F2 resonance at
391 910 770 MHz and 391 908 650 MHz (wavelength 765 nm, detuning −2.9 THz). The hyperfine

Other atomic species

The evaluation of the lattice light shift for other atomic species suitable for lattice clocks is, so far,
not as advanced as for Sr and Yb. For mercury, the magic wavelength and its derivative with respect
to the lattice frequency have been experimentally measured in Yamanaka et al. (2015); Tyumenev
et al. (2016), and theoretical estimates of the higher-order coefficients can be found in Katori et al.
(2015); Ovsiannikov et al. (2016). The magic wavelength for magnesium can be found in Kulosa
et al. (2015).

5.2.1

Collisions
Cold collisions

Large atomic samples are desirable in the operation of an optical atomic clock because they lower
the quantum projection noise, which in turn yields the fundamental limit on the instability of
the clock. On the other hand, at large atomic densities, cold collisions may lead to significant
undesirable clock line shifts.
In 3D optical lattice clocks the problem of collisional shifts can be eliminated altogether. One
way is to make sure that there can be only one atom per lattice site by blowing away atoms in
multiply occupied sites using a photoassociation laser beam, see, e.g., Akatsuka et al. (2010);
Origlia et al. (2018). Another approach is to load a quantum-degenerate, rather than thermal,
gas into the lattice (Campbell et al., 2017). In this case the clock lines originating from different
site occupancies are well resolved, resulting in the reduction of density shifts by many orders of
magnitude.
In certain applications, such as transportable clocks, the use of a 3D lattice may be impractical.
In a 1D lattice multiply occupied sites are difficult to avoid and the density shifts, even for fermions
(Lemke et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2013), can be as high as several 10−16 if uncontrolled. The
density of the sample can be lowered by distributing the atomic sample over many lattice sites in a
cavity-enhanced lattice (Le Targat et al., 2013; Nicholson et al., 2015). This way the atomic density,
and hence the density shifts, can be substantially reduced.
To evaluate the possible impact of the collisional shift, the density of the sample must first be
evaluated. Atoms trapped in a harmonic potential have a Gaussian spatial density distribution and
the figure of merit is a “density-weighted density” felt by the trapped atoms (Swallows et al., 2012)

Here hvx,y,z i = [exp(−h̄ωx,y,z /kB T ) − 1]−1 is the average vibrational quantum number. This expression correctly describes the width of the Gaussian density distribution expected for both the
lowest vibrational mode of the quantum harmonic oscillator (for T → 0) and a thermal sample with
finite T . The density can be controlled by changing the average number of atoms per site Nsite , by
changing the trapping frequencies using the trapping laser intensity and, in the case of the radial
frequencies ωx,y , also by changing the beam waist.

5. Understanding and controlling light and collisional shifts in optical lattice clocks

For example, the JILA SrI clock (Swallows et al., 2012) had Nsite ≈ 23, ωz = 2π × 80 kHz,
ωx = ωy = 2π × 450 Hz and Tx,y,z ≈ 3 µK, leading to an estimated average density of ρ = 3.9 ×
1011 atoms/cm3 . On the other hand, a setup at LNE-SYRTE (Le Targat et al., 2013) had atoms
loaded into the optical lattice directly from a blue MOT using a deep lattice and drain lasers
overlapped with the lattice to pump the atoms to metastable states. This reduces the density
because the blue MOT has a larger cloud than a red MOT. The parameters were Nsite ≈ 1.9,
ωz = 2π × 120 kHz, ωx = ωy = 2π × 250 Hz and temperatures Tx,y ≈ 15 µK (after Doppler cooling
in the transverse direction) and Tz ≈ 4 µK (after sideband cooling in the longitudinal direction).
The corresponding density is ρ = 2.7 × 109 atoms/cm3 . It should be noted that at sufficiently low
temperatures, the density in a 1D lattice scales as ρ ∝ T −1 (rather than ρ ∝ T −3/2 as expected for a
trapped gas) due to the reduced dimensionality.
Depending on whether the atomic species used is a boson or a fermion, there are fundamental
differences in the collisionally induced density shifts the atoms experience. Due to symmetry
considerations, bosonic atoms in the same electronic and nuclear spin states may only collide in
even partial waves — corresponding to the rotational quantum number l = 0, 2, 4, . . . (s-, d-, g-,. . .
waves, respectively). On the other hand, spin-polarised fermions in the same electronic states may
only collide in odd partial waves p, f,. . . (for l = 1, 3, . . ., respectively). Collisions in all partial
waves except for the s-wave are associated with a centrifugal barrier that grows as ∝ l(l + 1);
therefore, in the ultracold regime, only the lowest partial waves s and p are expected to be relevant
because the collisional kinetic energy is too low to penetrate the barrier. In these two partial waves,
the elastic collisions are completely described by the respective s- and p-wave scattering lengths a
and b. As an example we list these parameters for 87 Sr in Table 5.2.
Most of the work on optical clocks thus far has concentrated on fermionic species because
of their substantially reduced s-wave interactions and the expected “freezing out” of the p-wave
interactions. It turns out, however, that there are at least three cold-collisional mechanisms that can
contribute to density shifts in optical clocks that employ fermionic atoms in 1D optical lattices:
• imperfect spin polarisation of the sample (s-wave),
• inhomogenous excitation due to beam misalignment (s-wave), and finally
• p-wave interactions.
In a mixture of atoms in ground |gi and excited |ei states there are four possible collision
channels: a collision of two ground-state atoms |ggi = |g1 i ⊗ |g2 i, of two excited atoms |eei =
|e1 i ⊗ |e2 i, and two channels for collisions between ground-state and excited atoms in “triplet”

(5.8)

Due to symmetry considerations for spin-polarised fermions, p-wave collisions are only possible in
the |ggi, |eei and |ge+ i states. On the other hand, the “singlet” |ge− i states allow s-wave collisions
(Campbell et al., 2009). However, if the atomic sample is homogeneously driven by the laser field,
the |ge− i state remains unpopulated.
For distinguishable atoms, all partial waves contribute in all of these four collision channels.
Therefore, spin-polarisation impurities in fermionic species can lead to s-wave density shifts. For a
sample of distinguishable atoms, the shift of the atomic-clock transition frequency νge is (Campbell
et al., 2009)

2h̄ 
(5.9)
∆νge = ρ age+ (1 − 2 f ) + aee f − agg (1 − f ) ,
m
where m is the mass of the colliding atoms, ρ is the density of the atomic sample, f is the excited
fraction and axy is the s-wave scattering length for the collision channel |xyi. If a small fraction
η of the atomic sample is in a different spin state from the otherwise purely polarised sample,
this could lead to a frequency shift of η∆νge . A simple estimate of an upper bound for this
effect can be calculated if the respective scattering lengths and the density ρ are known. The
largest absolute value of this shift can occur at f = 0 or f = 1. For 87 Sr this occurs at f = 0,
where |agg − age+ | ≈ 64a0 . For a completely unpolarised sample of density ρ = 1011 cm−3 , this
corresponds to a shift of about 0.5 Hz, or a relative shift of about 1.2 × 10−15 . By reducing the
density to below ρ = 1010 cm−3 and the spin impurities to below η = 1%, this shift can be reduced
to below 10−18 . As a real-world example, McGrew et al. (2018) report a spin purity of ≥99.5% in
their 171 Yb clock.
Even in a perfectly spin-polarised sample there is a possibility of s-wave density shifts originating from the |ge− i collision channel if an excitation inhomogeneity is present (Campbell
et al., 2009; Swallows et al., 2011). The inhomogeneity may be a result of slightly different Rabi
oscillation frequencies for different atoms, for example due to a residual Doppler effect caused by
angular misalignment between the probe and lattice laser beams. It should be noted that even if
the laser beams were perfectly aligned, there is a residual angular spread because a Gaussian laser
beam always has some variation in its radius as it propagates. This effect can be eliminated by
carefully aligning the probe laser beam and using large beam waists.
The p-wave density shifts were initially expected to be marginal√at ultracold temperatures because the p-wave interaction energy scales as V ∝ kT2 b3 , where kT = 2πmkB T /h̄ is the wavenumber corresponding to the thermal de Broglie wavelength (Lemke et al., 2011). On the other hand, in
a 1D optical lattice ρ ∝ T −1 due to the reduced dimensionality. Therefore, for a fixed number of
atoms, p-wave collisional shifts cannot be “frozen out” by lowering the sample temperature (Zhang
et al., 2014b), but they can be controlled by lowering the density by other means. Also, the p-wave
density shift can be suppressed by up to about two orders of magnitude by carefully controlling the
excitation fraction (Lemke et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2013). Within the mean field approximation,
the density shift ∆ω is a linear function of the excitation fraction f (Martin et al., 2013),
∆ω = N [2χ( f − 1/2) +C] .

(5.10)

Here N is the total number of atoms, whereas χ = Vgg +Vee − 2Vge+ and C = Vee −Vgg are p-wave
interaction parameters. The values Vgg , Vge+ , and Vee are proportional to the respective p-wave
scattering lengths cubed. The proportionality factor depends, among other things, on the trap
geometry and the spatial distribution of atoms and could, in principle, be calculated theoretically
using the theory in Martin et al. (2013); Rey et al. (2014). In practice, however, χ and C can be

measured by varying the number of atoms in the trap and using Ramsey spectroscopy to measure
the density shift using the local oscillator as a short-term frequency reference (Lemke et al., 2011;
Martin et al., 2013). For a fixed atom number N, both χ and C are independent of the sample
temperature (Zhang et al., 2014b).
In principle, if the density shift in a given setup can be constrained to be on the order of 10−16
and the excitation fraction f can be controlled to within 1%, then the density shift could be further
suppressed to 10−18 . This requires the use of Ramsey spectroscopy. The initial Ramsey pulse has
to be tailored so that the excitation fraction f is at a value

This result is universal: it does not depend on the trap geometry, but only on the p-wave scattering
lengths. For example, using the scattering data in Table 5.2 one can calculate that the collisional shift
is suppressed in 87 Sr for f ≈ 0.625. For an 171 Yb clock, this technique enabled Ludlow et al. (2011)
to reach density shifts at the 10−18 level despite a relatively high density of ρ ≈ 3 × 1010 cm−3 .
Finally, we note that a suppression of density shifts in Rabi spectroscopy is also possible by
carefully tailoring the length of the probe pulse. For details, see Lee et al. (2016).

5.2.2

Background-gas collisions

The collisional shift of a clock transition due to the residual background gas is governed by the longrange interactions, which can be approximated by the van der Waals potential (Gibble, 2013a,b).
In optical atomic clocks the background gas consists mostly of hot clock atoms that were not
trapped and molecular hydrogen outgassing from the walls of the vacuum system. In Section 4.1,
we determined all the C6 coefficients needed to estimate the ratio of the relative collisional shift,
∆νbg /ν0 , to the collisional loss rate of clock atoms, Γbg . This ratio can be calculated with the
expression given by Gibble (2013a,b)
∆νbg
∆C6
=
,
ν0 Γbg 13.8πC6 ν0

(5.12)

where ∆C6 is the difference between the C6 coefficients of the ground and exited states of the clock
transition.
Only the collisions that do not lead to clock-atom loss from the optical lattice will contribute
to the collisional shift. Moreover, the optical transition requires the involvement of atoms that
are in both the ground and excited states. To estimate the loss of atoms in a spectroscopic clock
experiment, the interactions that have longer range and lead to greater losses should be used. For
the collisions considered here, this corresponds to the C6 coefficients of interactions between
background gases and clock atoms in the excited states.
Experimentally, the background-gas collisional shift can be measured by artificially increasing
the residual H2 pressure, for instance by heating a non-evaporable getter (NEG) pump to induce
outgassing. With residual gas analysis, it has been verified at NIST that the gas released by the
NEG pump is >95% H2 . The ratios for Yb–H2 and Sr–H2 were measured with this method at
NIST (McGrew et al., 2018) and LNE-SYRTE, respectively.
The theoretical and experimental values of the ratio ∆νbg /(ν0 Γbg ) in Yb and Sr optical lattice
clocks are summarised in Table 5.3. The uncertainties of the theoretically calculated values provided
in Table 5.3 reflect only the influence of the uncertainties of the C6 coefficients.

The blackbody radiation (BBR) emitted by the environment surrounding the atoms in optical clocks
causes an important shift of their frequency. This chapter explains how to control the thermal
environment in both optical lattice clocks and ion clocks and the techniques necessary to evaluate
the BBR shift uncertainty to 1 × 10−18 . In Section 6.1 a general introduction to blackbody radiation
is given. Section 6.2 presents the theory of the atomic response to the BBR necessary to calculate
the BBR shift. The role of emissivities and thermal inhomogeneity will be discussed in Section 6.3.
Finally, practical techniques for controlling the thermal environment of ion clocks will be presented
in Section 6.4 while Section 6.5 presents practical considerations for optical lattice clocks.

At T = 300 K, Equation (6.6) gives ωmax = 2π × 17.6 THz.
While the electric-field spectral density E(ω) is useful for calculating the atomic response
to the BBR field (Section 6.2), other spectral densities are more useful when dealing with heat
transfer (Section 6.3) or thermal imaging (Section 6.4.1). Moreover, many applications prefer to
use spectral densities in units of wavelength λ = 2πc/ω. Because equations like (6.3) include
differential quantities, these should also be considered while doing the substitution. For example,
Planck’s law for spectral radiance of a blackbody at temperature T , i.e., the radiated power per unit
area of the body, per unit solid angle, per unit wavelength, is (Rybicki and Lightman, 2008)

Atomic response to the BBR field

The BBR electric field causes a temperature-dependent shift in the transition frequency of atoms
and ions by the frequency-dependent Stark shift (Itano et al., 1982). The frequency shift between
the states e and g of an atom is given by
∆νeg = −

∆αeg (ω)E 2 (ω)dω,

(6.9)

where ∆αeg (ω) = αe (ω) − αg (ω) is the differential frequency-dependent dipole polarisability for
the transition. Theoretically the polarisability for the state i can be expressed as
αi (ω) =

ωi j

|di j |2 2

∑
h̄ j6=i
ωi j − ω 2

(6.10)

where di j and ωi j are the dipole-moment matrix element and transition frequency for the transition
between the states i and j. The summation runs over every state with dipole coupling to the state i.
For most optical clocks the peak frequency of the BBR radiation ωmax at room temperature,
Equation (6.6), is small compared to the transition frequencies that appear in Equation (6.10).
For example, Figure 6.1 shows the polarisability of the ground and excited clock states for Yb
atoms up to ω = 2π × 700 THz compared to the normalised spectral density for a blackbody at
T = 300 K. The dispersive shapes corresponding to the low-frequency transitions in Equation (6.10)

can be recognised. Also note the crossing between the two polarisabilities at ≈400 THz that is
the magic frequency for Yb lattice clocks (Derevianko and Katori, 2011). Assuming ωmax  ωi j ,
Equation (6.9) can be simplified as (Porsev and Derevianko, 2006)
∆νeg = −

∆αeg (0) 2
hE (t)i[1 + η(T )],
2h

(6.11)

where ∆αeg (0) is the static differential polarisability between the e and g states and a small dynamic
correction factor η(T ) accounts for the residual frequency dependence of ∆αeg (ω).
Given the importance of these parameters in the evaluation of the BBR shift of Equation (6.11),
considerable efforts have been made to determine their values either theoretically (Porsev and
Derevianko, 2006; Hachisu et al., 2008; Lea et al., 2006) or experimentally (Middelmann et al.,
2012a; Sherman et al., 2012; Beloy et al., 2014; Dubé et al., 2014; Huntemann et al., 2016).
Table 6.1 summarises the differential static dipole polarisabilities and dynamic corrections for the
clock transitions of some atomic species used in optical clocks. The table reports the polarisabilities divided by the Planck constant, ∆αeg (0)/h, using the units of the International System (SI).
Conversion factors to other units, including the popular atomic units (a.u.), can be found in Mitroy
et al. (2010).
The static contributions for neutral atoms have been determined experimentally by measuring
the differential polarisability in a static electric field for the (5s2 ) 1 S0 → (5s5p) 3 P0 transition in
strontium (Middelmann et al., 2012a) and the corresponding transition in ytterbium (Sherman
et al., 2012). For ion clocks the static contributions have been measured by using infrared lasers
(Huntemann et al., 2016) or by comparing the micromotion-induced scalar Stark shift (if positive)
to the time-dilation shift (Dubé et al., 2014).
The dynamic factor η(T ) can be expanded in a power series around a reference temperature T0

Figure 6.2. Fractional frequency difference δ ydyn between using only the leading-order (T /T0 )2 term and
including the (T /T0 )4 term in Equation (6.12) to estimate the dynamic contribution to the BBR-induced
frequency shift in strontium for T0 = 300 K. Approximation by the leading-order term underestimates the
magnitude of the shift for T > T0 . Based on the results reported by Middelmann (2013).

Further note that approximating the dynamic contribution by the leading T 2 term is only appropriate
within a small window around T0 . The T 4 term in Equation (6.12) is suppressed by a factor of
about 30 for ytterbium lattice clocks (Beloy et al., 2014), but by less than an order of magnitude for
strontium lattice clocks (Middelmann, 2013). Figure 6.2 shows the difference between using only
the leading term and including the T 4 term to estimate the dynamic contribution for the case of
strontium. The allowed deviation from T0 = 300 K for a fractional error below 1 × 10−18 is less
than 4 K; higher-order terms in Equation (6.12) must thus in many cases be taken into account in
lattice clocks operated around room temperature.
Figure 6.3 reports the uncertainty of the BBR shift in Sr clocks due to the uncertainty of
the representative temperature T and the atomic response coefficients as a function of T . In a
similar fashion, Table 6.2 reports the uncertainty of the BBR shift for different optical clocks
at different temperatures using Equation (6.11) and the data in Table 6.1. The uncertainty is
calculated at room temperature with different temperature uncertainties and at liquid nitrogen
temperature with an uncertainty of 1 K. For the Yb and Sr lattice clocks, a fractional uncertainty
of 1 × 10−18 requires temperature uncertainties of about 10 mK at room temperature or cryogenic

environments, where the requirements on temperature uncertainty are relaxed. Owing to the lower
value of the static differential polarisability, Yb+ (E3) clocks can achieve BBR uncertainty at the
level of 1 × 10−18 with 1-K uncertainties at room temperature. The Sr+ clock falls between the
lattice clocks and Yb+ (E3); a 100-mK temperature uncertainty at room temperature corresponds
to 1 × 10−18 fractional uncertainty with approximately equal contributions from the temperature
and the static differential polarisability. Even for the ion clocks, the uncertainty on the temperature
plays a critical role and this is mostly coming from the inhomogeneity of the thermal radiation in
the presence of thermal gradients, as explained in the next section.

where we have introduced the emissivity 0 < ε < 1 of the body to quantify the difference with
respect to a perfect blackbody. For a perfect graybody the emissivity ε is assumed wavelength
independent and reflections are assumed to be diffuse. For a general material it is possible to
introduce a wavelength- and temperature-dependent emissivity ε(λ , T ) in Equation (6.8), but in
most cases the approximation of Equation (6.13) is sufficient.
In general, the power radiating from a blackbody with temperature T1 and area A1 towards a

for graybodies by introducing the proper emissivities, but in this case care has to be taken to
also consider reflections from the surfaces. For two graybody surfaces with different emissivity

Figure 6.5. Simple model of a spherical vacuum chamber with temperature T1 and emissivity ε. A hole with
solid angle Ω leaks BBR radiation at temperature T2 inside the chamber. Atoms at the centre of the chamber
are modelled as a small spherical blackbody with effective temperature Ta,eff .

These equations are the basis of radiative heat transfer. In the next section we will illustrate their
use with a simple geometry, while complex systems like optical clocks often need to be modelled
by finite-element analysis (Doležal et al., 2015).

6.3.1

Basic model of temperature inhomogeneity

The role of temperature inhomogeneity can be better understood by analyzing the simple model
depicted in Figure 6.5. A similar model is presented by Middelmann et al. (2011). Atoms are
located at the centre of a spherical vacuum chamber which is held at temperature T1 . The chamber
wall has an emissivity ε. BBR radiation at temperature T2 leaks into the chamber through a hole
which spans a solid angle Ω with respect to the position of the atoms. We want to calculate the
effective temperature Ta,eff seen by the atoms. To do so we model the atoms as a small, perfect
blackbody with temperature Ta,eff and we impose steady state. The power balance on the atoms
should consider the following:
• The BBR at Ta,eff lost by the atoms.
• The BBR at T2 leaking through the hole. The simple geometry allow us to calculate the
view-factor between the atoms and the hole as Fa→2 = Ω/4π.
• The BBR at T1 from the chamber wall. The view-factor between the atoms and the wall is
Fa→1 = (1 − Ω/4π).
• The BBR at Ta,eff lost by the atoms but reflected back from the wall with reflectivity (1 − ε)
and reabsorbed.
• The BBR at T2 leaking from the hole, reflecting from the wall and reaching the atoms. This
contribution goes to zero as the size of the atom blackbody goes to zero for the simple
geometry considered.
Assuming the surface area of the atom blackbody is Aa and making use of the reciprocity
formula for the view factors, the steady-state condition implies

model of Figure 6.5, for Ω = 0.1 srad and ∆T = 1 K.

All prefactors to temperatures should add up to zero. Dropping σ Aa from the equation and solving
for Ta,eff we obtain

(6.22)
Ω + (4π − Ω)ε
Thus Ωeff > Ω for ε < 1. For a small temperature difference ∆T = T2 − T1 , Equation (6.21) can be

∆Ta,eff ≈

Ω + (4π − Ω)ε

Figure 6.6 shows this temperature increase for Ω = 0.1 srad and ∆T = 1 K as a function of ε.
While the model of Figure 6.5 is simplified, it represents well the problems encountered in
real-life optical clocks, such as the leaking of BBR from hot sources (e.g., atomic ovens) or the
apertures found in cryogenic fingers. The model suggests that to reduce the uncertainty coming
from temperature inhomogeneity, an optical clock should be designed with as little as possible
temperature gradients with line of sight to the atoms, with reduced solid angles to hot spots and
with high-emissivity surfaces to reduce reflections. The knowledge of the surface emissivities is
also important to predict the effective temperature seen by the atoms. Some of the techniques used
in practice will be discussed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.

6.3.2

Maximum-entropy approach to temperature inhomogeneity

A simple but powerful approach based on the principle of maximum entropy can be used if
the maximum and minimum temperatures seen by the atoms are known, even when a complete
84

OC18

6. Controlling the thermal environment for optical clocks

thermal model of the system is unavailable. This approach follows the “Guide to the expression of
uncertainty in measurement” (GUM, JCGM (2008a)) and has been used for several optical clocks,
e.g., Falke et al. (2014); Pizzocaro et al. (2017).
If the hottest and coldest points of the experiment within line of sight of the atoms are known, we
can assume that the effective BBR temperature seen by the atoms lies between the two extremes Tmax
and Tmin . The principle of maximum entropy then prescribes that a rectangular probability density
function between Tmax and Tmin should be used (JCGM, 2008b), as this is the least informative
choice one can make given the initial assumptions. The mean and standard deviation of the
rectangular distribution are then given by
Teff =
u(Teff ) =

Tmin + Tmax
,
2
Tmax − Tmin
√
.
12

(6.24a)
(6.24b)

These can be used to evaluate the BBR shift. Note that this approach does not rely on the temperature
distribution seen by the atoms (for example measured by different thermal sensors) but requires the
hottest and coldest points to be identified (for example by thermal imaging) and their temperature
to be measured.
For example, applying this method to the model of Figure 6.6 with Tmax − Tmin = 1 K results in
∆Ta,eff = 0.5(3) K. The uncertainty is high compared to the calculation of the previous section but
this result can be used without any knowledge of the emissivity and geometry of the system.

6.3.3

Measuring material emissivities

The emissivities of materials may be found tabulated, for example in Çengel and Ghajar (2015). In
general, however, the emissivities of materials may depend on temperature, roughness and surface
finish (Wen and Mudawar, 2006) and on the state of oxidation for the case of metals. When the
emissivity needs to be precisely known for FEM simulations or BBR-shift evaluation, it has to be
measured directly.
In this section we present a method to measure emissivity coefficients and give values for
the most popular vacuum-compatible materials used for vacuum chambers and thermal shields in
optical atomic clocks. This method evaluates the total emissivity of the surface. While thermal
imaging can be used to deduce emissivities, these are weighted by the spectral response of the
camera (see Section 6.4.1).
To measure emissivity coefficients, a dedicated experimental setup has been designed and built
at UMK, see Figure 6.7. The temperatures of the internal surfaces were calculated with a FEM
method for conductive heat transfer, while the radiative heat transfer was calculated analytically.
The setup was designed to maximise the view factor (see Figure 6.4) between a measured sample
and a calibrated thermometer plate. The measured samples are of cylindrical shape with a diameter
of 50 mm and a thickness of 8 mm. The thermometer plate, a 4-mm-thick copper cylinder of
diameter 48 mm, is placed opposite to the sample. It is mounted co-axially and in parallel with the
sample, with a separation of 1 mm. Thus, the diameter-to-separation ratio of the plates is around
50. The view factor between the plates is equal to 0.94, which is a good approximation of the ideal
case of two infinite plates, which has a view factor of one.
The sample is mounted with an indium gasket to a copper heater, the temperature of which
is controlled by a Peltier module. The copper element is made of Cu-ETP (electrolytic tough
pitch) and has a 20-mm diameter at its smallest cross-section. Two thermometers for temperature
stabilisation are installed inside the copper heater, close to the surface that stays in thermal contact
with the sample.

(green wire), chamber (orange), thermometer plate (red) and glass tube (blue) are read by the resistance
meter.

The thermometer plate absorbs the thermal radiation from the nearby surface of the sample.
The heat conductivity of the copper thermometer plate dominates over radiation losses so that its
temperature is homogeneous to within 1 mK at thermal equilibrium. The sample and thermometer
cylinders are enclosed in a vacuum chamber (pressure below 10−4 mbar) to ensure that conductive
and convective heat transfer via air is negligible (Hablanian, 1990).
The thermometer plate is installed on a 90-mm-long glass tube with an inside diameter of
3 mm and an outside diameter of 5 mm. The glass tube and the copper heater are attached to
the surrounding vacuum chamber by a Torr Seal compound gasket. Torr Seal epoxy has a low
thermal conductivity of 0.435 W/(K m) and prevents conductive heat exchange between elements
at different temperatures. The surrounding chamber is made of PA38/AW-6060 aluminium alloy
with a high thermal conductivity of 200 . . . 220 W/(K m).
All surfaces inside the chamber, except the radiating surface of the sample plate, are covered
with high-emissivity Krylon Ultra-Flat Black paint to eliminate reflections. This paint is vacuum
compatible at the 10−6 mbar level. The whole setup is submerged in a thermally insulated container
filled with a mixture of distilled water and ice to ensure stable thermal conditions and to prevent
heating of the chamber by thermal radiation from the measured sample. The only part that stays
in contact with the room-temperature environment is a 20-cm-long stainless steel pipe used for
connection to a turbomolecular pump.
Four Pt100 class 1/3B resistance temperature detectors (RTD) with phosphor-bronze four-wire
connections are installed in the setup: one in the chamber, one inside the thermometer plate, one
inside the sample heater and one inside the glass tube that holds the thermometer plate at the
point where the tube is mounted to the vacuum chamber, see Figure 6.7. The hysteresis of the
Pt100 RTDs upon heating and cooling is below 1 mK. The thermometers were calibrated against a
master thermometer1 , which was calibrated in the Polish Central Office of Measures with 3.5-mK
uncertainty. The total Pt100 calibration uncertainty is less than 10 mK in the temperature range
from 0.1 ◦ C to 35 ◦ C.
The analysis of the measurements that were carried out requires calculations of the view factors

between each pair of surfaces of the setup shown in Figure 6.7. Due to the simple geometry of the
experimental system (co-axial cylinders and parallel flat surfaces, see Figure 6.8), the relevant view
factors can be calculated analytically.
The process of modelling the heat transfer in the experimental setup must be performed for the
three main steps in the measurement procedure:
1. calibration of the conductive heat transfer via thermometer holder to the chamber,
2. calibration of the emissivity coefficient of the chamber’s internal coating, and
3. measurement of the sample emissivities.
The two calibration steps are necessary to calculate the conductive heat transfer via the thermometer
holder and the emissivity coefficient of the chamberâĂŹs internal coating and their uncertainties,
which are required for the measurement data analysis.
To determine the effective heat-transfer coefficient of the glass tube acting as the thermometerplate holder, an analytical heat-transfer model has been constructed. The holder (element 5 in
Figure 6.8) is a glass tube filled with air. The combination of two parallel, independent heat
transfers with different conductive heat-transfer coefficients can be substituted with the total heat
transfer with an effective heat-transfer coefficient keff and the holder can then be treated as a solid
rod. The total heat transfer needs to include heat added to the system via the resistive wire mounted
in the thermometer plate (2 in Figure 6.8) and all possible heat losses: conductive, convective and
radiative.
The surfaces of the internal parts of the setup, which are kept under vacuum, are covered
with high-emissivity Krylon Ultra-Flat Black paint. Its emissivity was known approximately, but
the uncertainty was unknown. To characterise the paint emissivity, a stainless-steel sample was
covered with the paint. That way, all surfaces inside the vacuum chamber were covered with the
same paint. The temperatures of the vacuum parts were measured for 11 values of the stabilised
temperature of the painted sample, ranging from 0.1 ◦ C to 25.0 ◦ C with a step of 2.5 ◦ C. The
results are shown in Figure 6.9. A linear function ε(T ) = aT + b was fitted to the data, yielding the
coefficients a = 0.000 074(37)stat (33)sys ◦ C−1 and b = 0.975 25(55)stat (41)sys . These values were
used to calculate the emissivities of the internal parts of the setup during further measurements.
The measured metals are known to be vacuum compatible and suitable for industrial machining
and finishing. Another selection criterion was to have high thermal conductivity to ensure low
temperature gradients, which is important for optical-clock vacuum chambers and thermal shields.
Hence, we chose the materials stainless steel 1.4301/304, aluminium PA38/AW-6060, copper CuETP and titanium grade 5/6A1-4V. Apart from the choice of material, the other crucial parameter
is the finishing grade of the surface. We describe this by the roughness of the surface, which is

defined by the DIN ISO 1302 standard. This standard describes the quality of the surface with a
roughness grade number which corresponds to the mean deviation of the assessed profile denoted
as Ra . In local national standards, this value also has an equivalent in the minimum and maximum
acceptable average distance between the highest peak and lowest valley in each sampling length,
denoted as Rz .
Two types of surface finishing were selected. The first one is machine finishing which is a
typical surface achieved in industry processes, also in off-the-shelf vacuum components. This type
of finishing corresponds to the roughness grade number N12, where Ra = 50 µm. A typical Ra
value for rough machining is in the range of 40–80 µm.
The second type of finishing was polishing of the materials with grade 600 polishing paste,
which corresponds to the N4 roughness grade number and Ra = 0.2 µm. This type of polishing
is highly reflective and can be applied both manually and mechanically for most of the common
metals used in vacuum systems due to the availability of the polishing media.
The results of the measurements are shown in Figure 6.10. The fitted linear coefficients are
gathered in Table 6.3.

Techniques for ion clocks

Ion clocks generally have smaller BBR shifts than lattice clocks, see Table 6.1. Table 6.2 shows
that the fractional-frequency-shift uncertainties for Sr+ and Yb+ are below the 10−17 level for
temperature uncertainties of 1 K or below. The uncertainty for Yb+ is dominated by the uncertainty
in the differential polarisability coefficient. For Sr+ , however, the uncertainty can be significantly
reduced with better knowledge of the BBR field (effective temperature). Evaluation of the BBR
field seen by the ion is, however, complicated by the fact that the trap structure itself, which covers
a significant fraction of the solid angle visible to the ion, heats up due to joule heating in conductors
and dielectric losses in insulators. One way to determine the effective temperature would be to use
in situ temperature sensors like in some lattice clocks (Nicholson et al., 2015), but this is difficult
due to several reasons. The trap structures are typically small and the presence of a sensor may
disturb the trap potential. Electrical sensors such as resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) and
thermistors suffer from self-heating and interference from the RF field. Surface-mounted Pt100
RTDs have been successfully used on an aluminium nitride (AlN) chip trap (Keller et al., 2019),
but this technique is not easily adapted to the traps used for typical single-ion clocks, see Chapter 3.
Therefore, in Section 6.4.3 we consider the possibility of using fibre-optic sensors for real-time
thermometry of ion traps.
A more common approach is to determine the effective temperature by a combination of thermal
imaging and FEM simulations (Doležal et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017a). These techniques will be
described in Sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2, respectively. Design recommendations on how to minimise
RF heating are given in Chapter 3.

6.4.1

Thermal imaging

In a thermographic camera, an IR lens focuses the radiation onto a focal-plane array (FPA) of
micrometer-size detectors. There are a number of detector types, see Figure 6.11. The most common
type is the thermal uncooled microbolometer detector, which has a relatively low sensitivity and
slow response. The other detector types shown in Figure 6.11 are quantum (photon) detectors
of different materials. These require cooling, which increases cost and complexity. Apart from
detector response curves, the two distinct wavelength ranges, mid-wave (MW, ∼3 . . . 5 µm) and
long-wave (LW, ∼7.5 . . . 13 µm), are governed by the so-called atmospheric windows, where the
atmospheric attenuation is reduced. Thermal imaging of ion traps takes place at short distances,
where this attenuation can be neglected, at least in the LW band.

For imaging ion traps, we note that LW cameras have a good overlap with the room-temperature
BBR spectrum, while there is a wider range of vacuum-window materials for MW. We can
distinguish between imaging of dummy traps and operational ion traps. With a dummy trap, the
vacuum window can be chosen solely based on its IR transmission. For example, in Doležal et al.
(2015) and the current work on the CMI trap, a LW camera and an AR-coated “Cleartran” (ZnS)
window (Edmund Optics #64-147) were used. In addition, one can apply high-emissivity tape or
paint to low-emissivity parts in order to improve the imaging contrast. With an operational trap, this
is not possible and reliable temperature readings can mainly be obtained from high-emissivity parts
like insulators. In principle it is possible to have a dedicated IR viewport in the ion-trap chamber,
but for compactness and optical access the IR window can also be used as the exit window for the
laser beams, requiring good transmission in the visible and near-infrared as well. For example, in
Nisbet-Jones et al. (2016) a MW camera and a MgF2 window were used, while current work on the
VTT MIKES trap used a LW camera and a CaF2 window. In the following, we consider using a
FLIR A615 LW camera and a CaF2 window as an example.
Modelling camera response and window properties
Figure 6.12 shows a typical camera response curve S(λ ) compared to a normalised BBR spectrum
at room temperature. As S(λ ) is not flat over the BBR spectrum, it is clear that the simple T 4
dependence cannot be valid. However, by numerical integration one can show that for finite
temperature ranges around room temperature, the integral can be well approximated by a linear
function in T 4 , but with an added constant,
BS (T ) =

Z ∞
0

S(λ )B(λ , T )dλ ≈ kS T 4 + B0 .

(6.25)

Figure 6.12 also shows the wavelength-dependent reflectivity, transmittivity, and emissivity of
the CaF2 window. In the same way as in Equation (6.25), we can linearise (in T 4 ) these window
properties weighted by the BBR and camera curves

6. Controlling the thermal environment for optical clocks

OC18

From the closure relation ρ + τ + ε = 1 follows kρ + kτ + kε = kS and Bρ,0 + Bτ,0 + Bε,0 = B0 . As
we will see later, the pre-factors in our measurement formulae always add up to one, which means
that the Bx,0 constants will cancel. We can then define the effective reflectivity, transmittivity and
emissivity as
hρi = kρ /kS , hτi = kτ /kS , hεi = kε /kS .
(6.27)
Similarly we can define “higher-order” coefficients like hτεi, which is needed for radiation emitted
by the window (away from the camera), reflected from the object (assumed to be a graybody) and
transmitted through the window on the way to the camera. Note that hτεi cannot be expressed as a
simple function of hτi and hεi.
The above is valid approximately in a certain, finite temperature range. The window’s τ, ρ and
ε actually have a small linear dependence on the temperature, but since the measurement formulae
are based on linearity in T 4 , we cannot account for this.
The measurement formulae
We start by considering measuring a sample in air, with no window. We can then (formally) write
what the camera measures as
BS (Tapp ) =

Z ∞
0

S(λ )B(λ , Tapp )dλ =

Z ∞
0



S(λ ) εobj B(λ , Tobj ) + (1 − εobj )B(λ , Trefl ) dλ . (6.28)

Here Tapp is the apparent temperature measured by the camera, εobj and Tobj are the emissivity
and temperature of the measured object (assumed to be a graybody), and Trefl is the temperature
reflected into the camera from the measured object. After linearisation, we obtain
4
4
4
Tapp
= εobj Tobj
+ (1 − εobj )Trefl
.

(6.29)

In principle, the emissivity can be evaluated as the slope of Equation (6.29) after measuring the
sample at several known temperatures. In practice, due to the thermal conduction and convection
of the air, it is difficult to estimate the true surface temperature even with a sensor embedded in
the sample. Thus, it is better to measure the emissivity values in vacuum, through an IR window
identical to the one used for the actual trap-heating measurements.
Measuring through a window, the linearised measurement formula becomes

where the terms describe radiation emitted by the object and transmitted through the window,
radiation emitted by the window, radiation reflected from the window, and radiation reflected
from the object and transmitted through the window. Since we are typically working at close to
4 ≈ hτiT 4
normal incidence, we can approximate the radiation reflected from the object as Tr,obj
r,win +
4

hεiTwin + hρiTobj , where the terms describe the external reflected temperature transmitted through
the window, the radiation emitted towards the object from the window, and radiation emitted by the
object and reflected back from the window. One might be tempted to add εobj in front of the last
term, but the prefactors must always add up to one. One can also see this as a consequence of not
explicitly considering multiple reflections. In practice, the reflections are not specular and there are
materials with different emissivities side by side, so this term is approximate, but fortunately hρi is
small (∼0.02). The formula becomes

6. Controlling the thermal environment for optical clocks

Correcting for window and sensor temperature
Since the effective transmission of the CaF2 window over the spectral range of the camera is only
34%, the window will absorb thermal radiation from the heated sample and heat up. In order to
measure the window temperature we put a 10 mm × 5 mm sandwich of black and aluminium tape
on the rear (sample) side of the window. The black tape provides a high-emissivity (ε ≈ 0.93)
surface that is in direct contact with the window surface, while the aluminium tape prevents direct
radiative heating of the black tape itself. The tape patch is positioned away from the measurement
areas to minimise the risk that reflections from the aluminium tape disturbs the measurements. If
4 =k
4
4
we fit the function Twin
win Tref + Twin,0 , where Tref is the bulk temperature given by the sensor,
to the data, we can substitute this into Equation (6.31) as a correction. Without accounting for this,
we obtain a window transmission and emissivities that are ∼0.01 too large. (If care is not taken to
minimise window heating, the error can be larger.)
Similarly we can monitor the temperature of the camera sensor by putting a metal mirror halfway
between the camera and the object so that one can record the sensor reflection simultaneously with
4 like for the window, we can take this into account in the
the object. If there is correlation with Tref
reflected temperature, but this effect is generally smaller than that of the window.
Measurements
The first measurement is to characterise the window transmission. This is done by measuring a
heated plate of known emissivity at different temperatures, first without and then with the window.
At small working distances, the reflected temperature is dominated by the reflection of the heated
camera microbolometer FPA from the object and thus it varies over the field of view. It can, however,
be obtained for each sample separately from the measurement at room temperature. Equation (6.29)
gives the true surface temperature as a function of the bulk temperature measured by a sensor.
Equation (6.31) can then be used to solve hτi (hρi and the second-order coefficients can here be
considered as small corrections that we can use the theoretical values for). To fit the model to the
measurement results, we introduce a wavelength offset ∆λ = 0.217(14) µm in the camera response
curve. This offset is reasonable considering that we are dealing with merely a typical response
curve.
The next measurement is to measure material emissivities in vacuum. The samples are glued
onto a temperature-controlled copper block together with reference samples of known emissivity
that are used to assess the surface temperature. Again, we determine the reflected temperatures at
room temperature and then we measure at different sample temperatures. Using Equation (6.31),
we can then determine the sample emissivities.
Finally, we measure the temperature of the ion trap with RF applied. Again, the analysis uses
Equations (6.29) and (6.31) for parts outside and inside the vacuum, respectively. Figure 6.13
shows a thermal image of the VTT MIKES trap. It was found that the heating was dominated by
the helical resonator (imaged separately, not shown).

6.4.2

Simulations

For the finite-element-method (FEM) simulations described here and in Doležal et al. (2015),
the commercial ANSYS software has been used. First the electromagnetic part of the model is
solved, which gives the losses (heat generation: joule heating in conductors and dielectric heating
in insulators) in the trap parts. These are used as a load for the steady-state thermal part of the
simulation, which gives a temperature map of the trap structures (according to given heat generation,
boundary conditions, heat conductivity and thermal radiation). The temperature seen by an ion
is evaluated as the temperature of a small (≈20 µm diameter) “blackbody sphere” inserted at the
expected ion position (usually the trap centre for single ion traps). Since the temperatures of the

(Bx1 and Bx2, emissivity 0.721(9)) gave reliable readings. Bx3 and El1 measure the fused-silica window
on the other side of the chamber. Pieces of black tape were attached to the flange and chamber to measure
the temperature of these. In the lower-right corner one can see the reflection of the camera sensor from the
metal mirror used to monitor the sensor temperature. This preliminary measurement was carried out at a
higher-than-normal RF voltage.

trap parts rise approximately by the same value above ambient temperature in usual laboratory
conditions (ambient temperature ≈20(5) ◦C), we can set up the FEM model for one selected ambient
temperature and then compare the predicted temperature rises with experiments. The uncertainty of
the computed temperature rise seen by the ion is evaluated by carrying out many simulations while
varying the parameters used in the model in the range of their expected uncertainties and deducing
the sensitivity of the ion temperature rise to the different parameters.
When developing a new trap design, the FEM simulation can be done with estimated parameters
to get an order-of-magnitude estimate of the temperature rise seen by the ion. Experimental
measurements of temperatures in the trap at operating conditions (applied trap voltage, frequency,
ambient temperature etc.) is necessary for understanding the heat dynamics in the trap and for fine
tuning the FEM model parameters. A detailed description of ion trap FEM simulations with some
examples can be found in Doležal et al. (2015).
In the following we list a few problematic areas and tips that one should consider when
developing FEM models for ion traps:
RF feedthrough is recommended to be included in the model: In some cases, the observed
temperature of traps designed for low heating is much higher than expected from the heat generation
in the trap parts. The excessive heat can be generated in the feedthrough insulator and then
conducted to the trap by wires.
Helical resonator coil is a substantial source of heat: Ion traps are often powered by a voltage
that is amplified using a helical resonator. The high-voltage end of the helical resonator coil can
have quite high temperature (several degrees above ambient temperature). In particular if the coil
end is directly joined to the massive feedthrough pin that supports the trap structure, it can have
considerable influence on the experimentally observed trap temperatures. From the FEM simulation
perspective it is good to measure the temperature of the high-voltage feedthrough pin and use it as

a boundary condition. If the feedthrough pin is not experimentally accessible, one can measure the
temperature of some nearby test point and then adjust the boundary conditions to get temperature
agreement at this point.
Thermal contact between parts: The thermal properties of the bond between two joined trap
parts is represented by the thermal contact conductivity (at least in ANSYS). The values for contact
conductivities even for common trap materials placed in vacuum are hard to find in the literature,
but can be estimated by measuring the temperature gradient across the bond. Sometimes it is good
practice to measure these gradients with the high voltage disconnected and by inserting a known
amount of heat to a particular part of the trap. This avoids uncertainties in the heat generated by
the RF high voltage resulting from imperfect knowledge of the loss tangent of dielectrics or of the
precise voltage amplitude influencing joule heat generation in conductors. For example, if there
are Pt100 sensors mounted on the trap structures like in Keller et al. (2019), these can be used as
heaters by running a DC current through them.
Vacuum gaps between two parts that seem to be connected: Apart from the bond contact
conductivity issue described above, there can be another problematic area for endcap trap designs
that use endcap and shield electrodes in the form of concentric cylinders separated by a dielectric
with high loss tangent and high relative permittivity. The gap between insulator and electrode can
reduce the effective voltage applied across the dielectric and consequently the heat generation is
lower than expected. It is possible to verify whether we have problems of this kind by measuring
the electrical capacitance of the trap and comparing the result with the analytic formula for the
capacitance of a multilayer concentric capacitor.
FEM software limitations: Commercial FEM software usually implements reflections as diffuse
and assuming graybodies. Specular reflections are not captured.
An example of a FEM simulation is shown in Figure 6.14 for the CMI trap design which is
described in Section 3.3.2. The heat generated in the feedthrough insulator is reduced by lowering
the electrical field (and consequently the heat generation) in the dielectric by making the diameter
of the insulator disk large and by separating the high voltage from ground as much as possible.
The heat generated in the helical resonator coil is removed by water cooling, which keeps the
feedthrough high-voltage pin at a stable selected temperature (e.g., at the temperature of the vacuum
chamber).
Model verification was done for three test points (outer frame, inner frame and shield electrode)
by thermal imaging. The experimentally observed temperature of the feedthrough flange was used
95

6. Controlling the thermal environment for optical clocks

as a boundary condition in the FEM model. The agreement between the FEM model and two
measurements is shown in Table 6.4. An ion located at the trap centre would see a temperature rise
∆Tion = 0.42(30) ◦C (for the conditions mentioned in Figure 6.14).

6.4.3

Real-time thermometry

This section discusses the feasibility of evaluating blackbody shifts in an ion clock using real-time
thermometry of the trap electrodes. Thermistors are unsuitable for this application since RF voltages
on the ion-clock trap electrodes induce high local RF pick-up resulting in their rapid destruction.
Typically, trap voltages are a few hundred volts and at frequencies of between 10 MHz and 20 MHz.
We therefore investigated the use of novel fibre-optic temperature sensors as an alternative to
thermistors to monitor electrode temperature.
Two GaAs fibre-optic temperature sensors were purchased from OpSens, together with a multichannel signal conditioner. The sensors were type “OTG-F”, selected on the basis of their small
size (150-µm outer diameter), fast response time (5 ms), specified accuracy (0.3 K) and resolution
(0.05 K). The fibre-optic sensors were mounted within the same aluminium block as Thorlabs
thermistors (part TSP01) that could be read by a PC via a USB interface. These thermistors were,
in turn, verified using calibrated “Edale” thermistors with a serial port connection. Measurements
in the same Al block gave excellent agreement between calibrated Edale thermistors and allowed
calibration of the Thorlabs sensors at the 0.1-K level. The fibre-optic sensors could also be calibrated
to a similar level of short-term temperature uncertainty. (For Sr+ at room temperature, a 0.1-K
temperature uncertainty gives rise to a relative BBR shift uncertainty of about 1 part in 1018 ).
We also checked the effect of electrode RF voltages on the measured temperature by switching
the local RF on and off at typical 5-s intervals; there was no observable change in the reading at the
0.1-K level. Significant problems arose, however, when the fibre-optic sensors were connected to
the read-out unit via a lossy fibre link. Although simple reconnection of a fibre link resulted in a
measured change in the observed temperature of less than 0.1 K, losses introduced by a fibre-optic
vacuum feedthrough increased this change to ∼0.2 K. Measurement variations at this level will
result in a frequency uncertainty due to the blackbody shift in room-temperature Sr+ of just over 1
part in 1018 . Since the fibre loss affected the temperature reading in a way that was not completely
reproducible in the short term, our conclusion is that fibre-optic temperature sensing is unsuitable
for Sr+ ion trap optical clocks with 10−18 overall uncertainty.

6.5

Techniques for lattice clocks

Several techniques have been developed to cope with the BBR shift in lattice clocks, both at room
temperature and in cryogenic environments. As discussed below, these designs should work under
ultra-high vacuum, should have sufficient optical access to manipulate atoms and should also have
enough physical access for atoms. The specific requirements for characterisation of the BBR
field experienced by the atoms, especially its representative temperature, depend strongly on the
temperature regime, as is discussed below. Notwithstanding, any temperature measurement must

take into account that the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) deviates from the
thermodynamic temperature scale (Fischer et al., 2011).

6.5.1

Cryogenic clocks

Lattice clocks featuring interrogation in a cryogenic environment benefit from a suppression of the
frequency shift induced by BBR by several orders of magnitude: the BBR-induced frequency shift
in a strontium lattice clock, for instance, is reduced from −2 Hz at room temperature (T ≈ 300 K)
to −9 mHz, i.e., about two parts in 1017 , near the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (T ≈ 77 K). This
substantially relaxes the uncertainty to which both the BBR field’s representative temperature and
the atomic response must be determined (see Figure 6.3). A moderate uncertainty u(T ) ≈ 0.1 K
of this temperature is sufficient to reduce the fractional uncertainty in the systematic frequency
shift to below 10−19 in the case of strontium, where the shift is larger than in other species such as
ytterbium or mercury.
There are several different approaches for realising a cryogenic lattice clock, e.g., regarding
translation of the atomic sample. Two schemes will be discussed in the remainder of this section:
firstly, translation of the optical lattice to transport atoms into a separate temperature-controlled
cryogenic environment within the apparatus for interrogation only and, secondly, a fully cryogenic
approach where the entire experimental procedure takes place in a cryogenic environment. The
former has already been demonstrated (Ushijima et al., 2015). An approach similar to the latter
has been demonstrated at room temperature (Beloy et al., 2014). However, there are additional
concerns that must be addressed for the case of cryogenic temperatures.
The main challenge of the fully cryogenic approach is the optical access required for implementing an optical lattice clock. Atom translation trades reduced optical access for additional
complexity and dead time required for transport.
Translation into a cryogenic environment
Atom translation is most easily achieved by translation of the optical lattice, particularly for twoelectron atoms as used in lattice clocks. Since interrogation is performed along the lattice direction
(only the case of a 1D optical lattice is considered here), optical and physical access to the cryogenic
compartment can be restricted to a single axis. Laser cooling, state preparation and, typically,
read-out are performed outside — with the possible exception of techniques that only require access
along the optical lattice, e.g., sideband cooling.
Pinholes provide both the physical access required to transport the atomic sample into and out of
the cryogenic compartment and optical access for the lattice and interrogation lasers. Diameters of
d . 0.5 mm are typically sufficient to accommodate the laser beams. As discussed in Section 6.3.1,
the contribution of a pinhole to the BBR field experienced by the atoms depends on its diameter
d and distance L from the atomic sample. The fractional frequency shift due to a pinhole with
d ≤ 0.5 mm and L ≥ 15 mm can be kept below 5 × 10−19 (Middelmann et al., 2011; Al-Masoudi,
2016). Windows can be used for more convenient optical access, e.g., to extract the optical lattice
for retroreflection, but need to be thick enough to block out residual transmitted BBR (see below).
The mechanical design of the cryogenic compartment is usually dictated by the need to transport
the atomic sample far into it and optical access to the preparation volume in front of it. Figure 6.15
shows the cylindrical design with a cone-shaped tip used in the strontium lattice clock at PTB as an
example. The bulk of the compartment must be manufactured from a material with high thermal
conductivity, typically copper, to reduce thermal inhomogeneity within the cryogenic environment.
Radiative contact with the surrounding room-temperature vacuum system can lead to substantial
heat load. Moreover, it is crucial to increase the emissivity of the compartment’s inner surfaces
as much as possible, e.g., by applying vacuum-compatible black paint or using a graphite tube,

to minimise the indirect perturbation of the atomic transition frequency by BBR leaking through
pinholes or windows. Objects inside the cryogenic compartment, such as the aforementioned
graphite tube, require careful consideration of their thermal contact with the remainder of the
system and may lead to extended thermalisation time constants. Placement of the temperature
sensors is not particularly critical, aside from general caveats such as parasitic heat conduction via
the wires and self-heating in vacuum.
Due to the small distance of its inner surfaces from the atomic sample, potential patch charges
must be considered when designing the cryogenic environment. Characterisation of the DC Stark
shift caused by residual static electric fields within should be possible, e.g., by installing electrodes
that allow applying electric fields in a controlled fashion.
Furthermore, the residual background pressure inside the cryogenic volume must be kept in
mind. Pinholes act as differential pumping stages leading to an increased background pressure on
the inside without pumping (e.g., by non-evaporable getter materials). Materials that are prone to
outgassing should thus be avoided.
Translation of the atomic sample is achieved either by inducing a frequency detuning between
counterpropagating lattice beams to create a travelling standing wave (Ushijima et al., 2015) or by
mechanically translating the lattice optics (Middelmann et al., 2012b). The distance across which
the atoms can or need to be transported is an important factor to be considered when designing
the cryogenic compartment. In the latter case, the focus position of the beams moves along with
the atomic sample. Avoiding Doppler frequency shifts induced by residual atomic motion with
respect to the reference system of the interrogation laser is crucial in both cases. Mechanical
translation allows the retroreflection mirror of the lattice to be used as a phase reference for the
interrogation laser and to cancel the dominant effect of residual longitudinal motion. However,
controlling motional effects at the 10−18 level of uncertainty has proven challenging (Al-Masoudi,
2016). In any case, the time required for translation across a given distance is ultimately limited by
the acceptable perturbation of the atomic sample in either case.
Fully cryogenic clock

6. Controlling the thermal environment for optical clocks

homogeneous at cryogenic temperatures is crucial for a fully cryogenic lattice clock. A suitable
environment for room-temperature operation has already been demonstrated (Beloy et al., 2014).
For a cryogenic clock, however, several additional problems must be considered — in particular,
transmission of BBR through any windows and the substantial heat load on any surfaces with high
emissivity that are exposed to the surrounding room-temperature environment.
Although the glasses typically used for laser optics are non-transmitting across most of the
spectral region that is relevant for BBR, there are two distinct cases where BBR leaking through
a window may cause a substantial frequency shift of the clock transition. The first is terahertz
radiation. The window’s absorption eventually decreases toward low frequency, where the power
spectral density in the BBR field is still quite substantial. The second case is the high-frequency tail
of the BBR spectral power distribution, reaching into the transmission region of the window. Here,
the polarisability of the electronic states used by the clock may be substantial due to transitions in
the visible or near-infrared spectral range. For strontium, the (5s5p) 3 P0 → (5s4d) 3 D1 transition at
a wavelength of about 2.6 µm is the most relevant.
Absorption of terahertz radiation by various types of glasses has been studied by Naftaly and
Miles (2007). Their investigation shows that ionic and disorded glasses like BK7 exhibit much
stronger absorption in this frequency regime than more frequently used materials such as silica.
For a strontium lattice clock operating in a cryogenic chamber, leakage of room-temperature BBR
radiation with ν ≤ 2 THz through a 3-mm-thick window alone leads to residual fractional shifts of
about 2 × 10−18 for silica, but only 3 × 10−20 for BK7 glass. (These values are upper limits that do
not include any reduction due to the actual field of view.) Therefore, BK7 glass should be favoured
as a material for windows in the cryogenic environment.
We have combined the results reported by Naftaly and Miles (2007) with absorption measurements of N-BK7 glass samples at frequencies in the range from 1 THz through 120 THz carried out
at PTB in Berlin2 and the manufacturer’s specifications (SCHOTT AG, 2014) at high frequencies
to model the frequency-dependent absorption across the relevant spectral range. Together with the
spectral density of the BBR field (see Equation (6.3)) at room temperature (Tenv = 300 K), the DC
Stark polarisability and the frequency-dependent corrections due to the most relevant low-frequency
resonances, we have then used this model to estimate the maximum frequency shift (excluding any
reduction due to the actual field of view) due to BBR leakage through windows as a function of
their thickness for the case of a strontium lattice clock. We find that a window thickness of about
10 mm is required to reduce it to less than 1 part in 1018 . However, the shift in an actual clock will
be reduced further due to the field of view (see Section 6.3.1). Note that the dominant contribution
(about 75 %) to the frequency shift arises from the aforementioned 3 P0 → 3 D1 transition.
Additionally, a window exposed to room-temperature BBR also suffers from substantial radiative heating due to its high emissivity, while heat dissipation is hindered by its relatively low
thermal conductivity. Thus, it becomes substantially warmer than surrounding parts made from
high-conductivity, low-emissivity materials such as copper. In particular, a hot spot in the atoms’
thermal environment forms on the inner surface of the window. Its temperature may be elevated by
several kelvin. Therefore, designs with a single layer of windows are not suitable for cryogenic
lattice clocks. The problem can be mitigated by adding a secondary layer of windows. The inner
windows do not experience substantial radiative heating and block out BBR emitted from the hot
spot. Figure 6.16 shows an example of the temperature distribution in such a setup, determined by
a FEM simulation. The secondary layer can be mounted to the same superstructure as the primary
layer or to a separate superstructure, which facilitates removing the heat transferred to the windows
without increasing temperature gradients across the environment exposed to the atomic sample.
Physical access to the cryogenic environment is still required for loading from an external atomic
source and for pumping, unless a suitable pump is installed within the cryogenic environment, e.g.,

using non-evaporable getter materials. Due to the various sources of residual room-temperature
BBR, ensuring high emissivity of the cryogenic environment’s interior surfaces is highly important,
e.g., by applying a suitable vacuum-compatible black paint.
Using these guidelines, a suitable temperature-controlled environment for fully cryogenic
operation can be designed. Its dimensions are typically limited by the volume and optical access
required for a conventional magneto-optical trap setup.

6.5.2

Room-temperature clocks

As an alternative to cryogenic clocks, room temperature solutions can be looked for. For example,
the temperature gradients across the vacuum chamber can be monitored and an uncertainty calculated as in Section 6.3.2. BBR uncertainty at the level of 1 × 10−17 can be achieved in this way
(Falke et al., 2014; Hachisu and Ido, 2015; Pizzocaro et al., 2017). Alternatively, Nicholson et al.
(2015) proposed the use of radiation thermometry, where in situ thermometers were used to measure
the thermal environment close to the atom position, and achieved a BBR uncertainty of 2 × 10−18 .
Finally, high-thermal-uniformity BBR shields can be used and operated at room temperature
achieving uncertainty at 1 × 10−18 , as first developed at NIST by Beloy et al. (2014). The shield
described by Beloy et al. (2014) has been used for an Yb lattice clock (McGrew et al., 2018). It is
made of copper for high thermal conductivity and has seven windows for optical access and two
apertures to allow the atomic beam through. A high-emissivity carbon-nanotube coating is applied
to all internal surfaces of the shield body. Eight calibrated thermometers are embedded in the shield
for real-time measurements of the shield’s absolute temperature. The shield is kept under ultra-high
vacuum of 2 × 10−7 Pa, for both thermal isolation and atom trapping.
The uncertainty budget for the BBR shift in the shield considered the calibration and reading of
the thermometers, and the temperature inhomogeneity caused by the windows and by the aperture.
The role of the effective solid angles of the two apertures is similar to the problem presented in
Section 6.3.1, but here the effective solid angles of the apertures were estimated by FEM simulation.
The calculations are simplified given the high emissivity of the black coating and are not limited by

the knowledge of the emissivity of the windows. Given that the windows are not as good a thermal
conductor as copper, a thermal gradient can be established on their surfaces, even if the effect is
smaller at room temperature than at cryogenic temperatures. Given the low temperature uncertainty
of the NIST system, the dominant contribution to the uncertainty is given by the dynamic coefficient
of Yb. Beloy et al. (2012) also changed the temperature of their shield between 280 K and 360 K,
verifying Equation (6.11) in this temperature range.
A picture of a similar shield developed at INRIM is shown in Figure 6.17. The shield is a
single copper block and is coated with a black coating compatible with ultra-high vacuum (Acktar
Black). Six Pt100 thermometers are embedded in the shield for temperature evaluation. A single
aperture will be used for atomic physical access. An uncertainty of 10 mK is expected for the shield
temperature. Unlike the NIST design, this chamber will separate the inner vacuum that will be kept
at ultra-high vacuum for increased atomic lifetime and the outer vacuum that will be maintained for
thermal insulation only.
Beloy et al. (2018) updated the shield design so that it also works as a Faraday cage to shield
atoms from external electric fields. High voltages (up to 2 kV) can be applied to the conductive
coating on the windows to directly measure the Stark shift. This application of high voltages
requires the shield to be protected by insulating plastic to avoid arcing. This insulation further helps
with the thermal uniformity of the shield.

This chapter explains how to minimise optical-clock inaccuracy and instability through careful
choice of probing sequences and timings. In Section 7.1, methods are presented to reduce inaccuracy
associated with frequency shifts induced by the probe laser itself. This is followed in Section 7.2
by recommendations for the optimum probe times to minimise instability, given typical frequencynoise characteristics of the probe laser. Section 7.3 demonstrates how the Dick effect in optical
lattice clocks can be eliminated and Section 7.4 discusses how interleaving different measurements
can be used to characterise and remove frequency shifts arising from the interaction of atoms with
their environment. Finally, the applicability of these interrogation methods is demonstrated in
Section 7.5 with a case study based on Yb+ optical clocks.

7.1

Methods to reduce uncertainty from probe-induced shifts

The desired output frequency of an atomic clock is that of the unperturbed atomic transition. It is
inevitable, however, that probing the atom will disturb the very transition that is being used as the
reference, leading to frequency shifts proportional to probe intensity. For many optical clocks, the
intensity of the probe beam is sufficiently weak that the resulting disturbances lead to fractional
frequency shifts well below the 10−18 level and can be neglected. Notable exceptions to this are
the zero-spin bosonic optical lattice clocks based on the 1 S0 → 3 P0 transition (e.g., 88 Sr, 174 Yb,
24 Mg) (Baillard et al., 2007; Poli et al., 2008; Akatsuka et al., 2010; Kulosa et al., 2015) and the
ytterbium ion optical clock, based on an electric octupole transition (Roberts et al., 1997, 2000;
Godun et al., 2014; Huntemann et al., 2016).

7.1.1

Outline of the problem

In fermionic optical lattice clocks, the nuclear spin gives rise to hyperfine structure and quenching
of the 3 P0 excited clock state, giving natural linewidths on the order of a few millihertz. Sufficient
Rabi frequencies for clock interrogation are obtained with very small probe powers, 1 µW, and
cause negligible probe-induced frequency shifts. In the boson there is no such favour and the clock
state is very long lived (∼years), decaying eventually through a weak E1M1 transition. To drive the
clock transition requires a multi-photon excitation (e.g., by E1M1 or E1E1E1) using moderately
large probe powers which incur large probe-induced AC Stark shifts. A popular approach is
so-called magnetically induced spectroscopy (MIS) which drives the clock state using a resonant
photon (E1) from an intense probe beam, ∼mW, and large applied static magnetic field, ∼mT, (M1)

(Taichenachev et al., 2006; Barber et al., 2006). While attractive for its ease of implementation, it
has both AC Stark and Zeeman probe-induced shifts to contend with.
In the ytterbium ion, the electric octupole transition is highly forbidden and has such a narrow
linewidth that the spectral overlap with the probe laser is very low. Probe powers at the mW level
are typically needed in a beam waist of ∼10 µm in order to drive the clock transition on a timescale
of ∼100 ms. At these intensities, the AC Stark shift from the probe beam can induce fractional
frequency shifts of ∼10−13 . Care must be taken to eliminate these frequency shifts from the final
clock output, and the following subsections outline some different approaches. Although these
methods are demonstrated below with ytterbium ion optical clocks, they are equally applicable to
bosonic optical lattice clocks or for removing smaller probe-induced shifts in other optical clocks.

7.1.2

Extrapolation to zero frequency shift

A conceptually straightforward approach to eliminate the AC Stark shift induced by the probe is to
measure the clock frequency with two different probe-beam intensities. The clock frequency can
then be extrapolated to the case of a probe beam with zero intensity (King et al., 2012; Huntemann
et al., 2012b). In practice, with sufficiently stable beam pointing, the intensity remains proportional
to the power and so only the power of the probe beam needs to be changed. Assuming the powers do
not exceed the range of linear scaling of the AC Stark shift, then Figure 7.1 shows the frequencies
f1 and f2 that are measured with probe powers P1 and P2 .
The unperturbed clock frequency f0 can be evaluated in terms of f1 , f2 and the ratio of the
probe powers, κ = P2 /P1 ,

Note that f0 depends only on the ratio of the powers, κ, rather than their absolute values. This is
very convenient to measure experimentally as it requires only a power meter with good linearity,
and does not require the power meter to be calibrated for absolute powers.
The experiment can be run in a mode that alternates between frequency readings at the two
different power levels, with software carrying out on-the-fly extrapolation. The timescale for
switching between the different power levels should be dictated by how quickly other parameters
begin to drift. For example, if the beam position were to move during the extrapolation cycle, the
power would no longer be proportional to the intensity at the atom and the extrapolation would be

incorrect. In general, it is best to switch power levels as often as possible. But note that an exact
alternation between high and low powers may be unwise if there is frequency drift in the probe
laser that is predominantly in one direction. The issue of how best to alternate probe pulses is dealt
with in Section 7.4.
To account for the uncertainty introduced in the extrapolated clock frequency, σ ( f0 ), a propagation of errors in Equation (7.1) leads to

The existence of a term depending on σ (κ) shows that any error in the knowledge of the power
ratio κ would introduce a bias in the clock frequency f0 , but larger values of κ lead to smaller
errors. The frequency extrapolation in the ytterbium ion clock is typically carried out with power
ratios around two or three. With sufficient care over the power stability of the probe beam and
the electronics used to monitor the power, it is possible to have knowledge of κ to a level that
introduces no more than 10−18 fractional offset to the extrapolated clock frequency.

7.1.3

Tailored pulse sequences

Instead of measuring and accounting for light shifts by extrapolation, as outlined above, we can
employ tailored interrogation pulse sequences based on generalised Ramsey excitation schemes,
which allow for suppression of the light shift and other interrogation-related shifts.
In the Ramsey scheme (Ramsey, 1990), the two levels of the clock reference transition are
brought into a coherent superposition by a first excitation pulse followed by a free-evolution period.
After a second excitation pulse the population in one of the levels is detected, which shows the
effect of the interference of the second pulse with the time-evolved superposition state. In the case
of excitation with high probe-light intensity that is required to drive a strongly forbidden transition,
the spectrum obtained with Ramsey excitation indicates the presence of the light shift: the position
and shape of the envelope reflects the excitation spectrum resulting from one of the pulses, whereas
the Ramsey fringes result from coherent excitation with both pulses and the intermediate dark
period. The fringes are less shifted than the envelope because their shift is determined by the time
average of the intensity. This results in a shifted and asymmetric Ramsey pattern.
This intuitive picture suggests that the effect of the light shift ∆L on the spectrum can be
compensated by introducing a frequency step of the probe light, ∆S = ∆L , during the interrogation
pulses as proposed in Taichenachev et al. (2010). Additionally, the scheme can be made insensitive
against small changes of the laser intensity or errors in ∆S by inserting an additional pulse with
identical intensity and frequency, but with a doubled duration, between the Ramsey pulses. The
additional pulse compensates the dephasing between the atomic coherence and the probe laser
field caused by the Ramsey pulses. The phase of the additional pulse is shifted by π relative to
the Ramsey pulses in order to improve the robustness against variations of the pulse area. The
frequency steps are applied in a phase-coherent way so that they do not introduce additional phase
changes of the probe field. These are the essential elements of the hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy
(HRS) scheme as proposed in Yudin et al. (2010) and first experimentally demonstrated on the
electric octupole transition 2 S1/2 → 2 F7/2 in 171 Yb+ (Huntemann et al., 2012a).
In order to stabilise the frequency of an oscillator to the line centre of the atomic resonance
signal, in many clocks resonance signals are alternately recorded with a fixed positive and negative
detuning around the line centre. The difference between the excitation probabilities obtained with
these detunings yields a discriminator signal that varies antisymmetrically around the resonance
centre. For Ramsey excitation, a discriminator signal can also be produced by alternately applying
phase steps of φ = ±π/2 to one of the excitation pulses while the excitation frequency is kept
constant (Ramsey and Silsbee, 1951; Letchumanan et al., 2004). If applied to the HRS excitation
104

OC18

7. Optimised interrogation methods

scheme, the latter technique is particularly advantageous because the immunity to light-shift
fluctuations that lead to asymmetries in the line shape is further enhanced.
The light-shift-compensating step frequency ∆S is readily obtainable from Rabi spectroscopy.
In order to confine δL = ∆L − ∆S to the region where the HRS clock error remains small, use
can be made of the significantly larger sensitivity of νclock = νRabi to δL in Rabi spectroscopy. A
feedback loop that employs the difference ε = νHRS − (νRabi − ∆S ), as determined with HRS and
Rabi excitations, as the discriminator signal can be used to steer ∆S so that |δL | approaches zero.
Although the combination of interrogation schemes converts the uncertainty due to the light
shift into a predominantly statistical contribution, systematic shifts can be caused by drifts of the
light shift and by a difference of the shifts present during the Rabi and the HRS interrogations. In
the realisation with the 171 Yb+ optical clock at PTB (Huntemann et al., 2016), slow variations of
the light shift corresponding to a drift of ∆L in the range of 50 µHz/s are typically observed. With
a servo time constant of 200 s for ∆S , the resulting servo error of δL is 10 mHz. This error could be
avoided by using a drift-compensating second-order integrating servo algorithm (Peik et al., 2005).
The main reason for differences in the frequency shifts present during the interrogation pulses are
transient thermal effects of the crystal of the AOM that shapes the pulses. The resulting phase
variations (AOM chirp) were found to lead to a frequency difference of less than 1 mHz (Kazda
et al., 2016). Beam pointing and focussing variations induced by different crystal temperatures were
found to lead to light-shift differences between the pulses of less than 0.2 mHz. The combination of
these systematic effects and the residual sensitivity ∂ νHRS /∂ δL = 0.07 yielded a probe-light-related
fractional uncertainty of 1.1 × 10−18 .
A more universal approach to eliminate a wide variety of interrogation-induced shifts like light
shifts, phase chirps, and transient Zeeman shifts was developed within the OC18 project, based
on actively balancing the spectroscopic responses from phase-congruent Ramsey probe cycles of
unequal durations, see Figure 7.2 (Sanner et al., 2018). This autobalanced Ramsey spectroscopy
(ABRS) scheme has been experimentally demonstrated and it was shown that no systematic clock
errors are incurred for arbitrarily detuned or otherwise defective drive pulses.
The fact that the spectroscopically relevant phase information is acquired during an interactionfree period makes Ramsey’s protocol the natural choice when aiming to undisturbingly extract
the transition frequency ωeg = Ee /h̄, where Ee is the energy of the excited state |ei relative
to the ground state |gi. Nonetheless, the deterministic preparation of the initial superposition
state and the subsequent phase readout, which maps phase differences to observable population
differences, require interactions with the oscillatory drive pulses. Hence, pulse defects (e.g.,
frequency deviations) potentially affect the outcome of the spectroscopic measurement leading to
erroneous phase values and corresponding clock errors. If the local-oscillator phase and the atomic
phase evolve at identical pace during the dark period, one can expect to find the same excited-state
population when comparing the outcome of two “isomorphic” interrogation sequences which only
differ in their dark times Tshort and Tlong (see also Morgenweg et al. (2014)).
Based on the simple insight that interrogation-induced errors are common mode for isomorphic
Ramsey sequences it is now straightforward to combine Tshort and Tlong Ramsey interrogations. The
respective populations p̃short and p̃long can be combined into a defect-immune spectroscopy scheme
by using the differential population p̃bal = p̃long − p̃short as an error signal for the local-oscillator
frequency ωLO . From this one obtains a passively balanced frequency feedback with p̃bal = 0
exclusively for ωLO = ωeg .
This approach, however, comes with a major drawback that is, to a lesser extent, also encountered in recently proposed coherent composite-pulse schemes (Hobson et al., 2016; ZanonWillette et al., 2016): for p̃short 6= 0 the frequency discriminant p̃bal (δ ) is no longer an odd function
around δ = 0, where δ = ωLO − ωeg is the detuning, which leads to skewed sampling distributions
and corresponding clock errors. To avoid this issue we implement an active balancing process with
two interconnected control loops as schematically displayed in Figure 7.2(b). The first feedback

loop, acting on the short Ramsey sequence, ensures p̃short = 0 by injecting together with φ ± an

additional phase correction φ c . Of course, this requires that the drive detuning δ 0 = ωLOdrive − ωeg
is smaller than the Rabi frequency Ω0 for sufficient fringe contrast. Depending on the dominant
source of error, one could also use ωLOdrive as the control variable. During Tshort the local oscillator
evolves with ωLO as determined via the second feedback loop which controls the long Ramsey
sequence by steering ωLO so that p̃long = 0. Vice versa, φ c (or ωLOdrive ) as obtained from the short
sequence is identically applied in the long Ramsey sequence. In this way a constantly updated
common-mode correction autobalances the long interrogation whose outcome is then denoted

points’ statistical uncertainties eventually increase due to the reduced fringe amplitude. In contrast,
operating a HRS interrogation at δ 0 > Ω0 yields large clock errors that scale linearly with δ 0 ;
only for δ 0  Ω0 is the error propagation suppressed to first order. Without compensating for the
motional heating of the ion (Section 3.1.2), one finds a residual dependence of δ on δ 0 as displayed
in Figure 7.3(b). This dependence is rather weak and does not introduce a clock error as long as δ 0
is on average zero; yet it confirms that heating violates the isomorphism of short and long Ramsey
sequences.
In order to illustrate the universality of the autobalancing approach, the Yb+ clock’s response
to various intentionally introduced interrogation defects was measured. Figure 7.4 displays three
defect scenarios together with their resulting clock errors. In the first scenario the π/2-pulses are
delivered with 97% of the nominal intensity for the last 3 ms of their 15 ms on-time. Considering a
total light shift of 660 Hz this intensity defect is equivalent to a temporary ωLOdrive deviation of more
than Ω0 and gives rise to a clock shift of about 1 Hz when using an unbalanced Ramsey sequence.
Autobalancing the acquisition recovers the undisturbed clock frequency to within the statistical
uncertainty. Similarly, defect immunity is verified for drive pulses suffering from engineered phase
defects with 0.15π phase excursions during the second half of each atom-light interaction. Finally,
a third scenario assumes a phase lag θ = π/10 after the first π/2-pulse, i.e., one effectively uses
φ ± = ±π/2 + θ instead of employing a symmetric phase modulation. In this case the injected
servo-controlled phase correction φ c compensates the encountered phase lag one-to-one.
While these pulse defects are exaggerated for demonstration purposes they represent a wide
variety of less pronounced and often unnoted parasitic interrogation side effects. For instance, many
clocks incorporate magnetic-field switching for the atomic ground-state preparation. Certain clock
transitions also require magnetic-field-induced state admixtures to enable direct optical Ramsey

excitation (Taichenachev et al., 2006). Due to transients associated with the switching of the field,
the dark Ramsey time gets perturbed by a transient Zeeman shift, which has in the past limited
the accuracy of such clocks. Phase excursions triggered by laser beam shutters or acousto-optic
modulators are another possible source of error. By choosing a proper Tshort that still registers the
transient perturbations, one can preventively address all such issues.

7.2

Optimum probe time and achievable instabilities for various
clock candidates

The fractional frequency instability of an optical clock is an important performance criterion, since
it determines the averaging time required to achieve a certain frequency resolution. Fundamentally,
it arises from quantum projection noise (QPN) of the measured atomic populations and is typically
expressed as an Allan deviation (Riehle, 2004), which for Ramsey interrogation is given as
r
1
Tc
√
σC (τ) =
,
(7.3)
ωT N τ
where ω is the angular frequency of the clock transition, N the number of interrogated atoms, T the
Ramsey time, Tc the total cycle time including dead time, and τ the averaging time. This relation
shows that the probe time should be as long as possible to achieve small statistical uncertainties.
The maximum probe time is limited by either the excited-state lifetime of the clock transition
(Peik et al., 2005) or the coherence time of the laser (local oscillator, LO) (Leroux et al., 2017),
which typically follows a flicker-floor-limited instability (flat Allan deviation) for the probe times
of interest. In a simple picture, the maximum probe time due to laser phase noise is given by
the noise accumulating to more than ±π. Such a large phase error during interrogation results
in ambiguities in the assignment of the Ramsey fringe being probed and thus in so-called “cycle
slips” and loss of lock. Within the OC18 project, we have analytically and numerically investigated
optimum probe times for different LO noise characteristics and atom numbers (Leroux et al., 2017),
complementing previous work on lifetime-limited probing (Peik et al., 2005) for single ions.

shorter probe times to avoid fringe hops; a suggested safe upper bound on the probe time is given in the
second column. From Leroux et al. (2017).

In the following we summarise our findings and provide explicit values for optimal interrogation
times as a function of typical LO noise levels and clock candidates. The calculation assumes a
dead-time-free interrogation scheme (T = Tc ) and therefore neglects the Dick effect. Furthermore,
spontaneous emission from the excited clock state is neglected. Including both effects into the
analysis is subject to future work.
We define a characteristic timescale Z = 1/(ωσL ) for which the LO Allan deviation σL (independent of its noise characteristic) equals the instability of the clock after one probe cycle of a
single atom as given by Equation (7.3). The first important result is given in Table 7.1, which lists
the recommended optimal probe times To for a given noise spectrum and noise level, together with
the asymptotic optimum for large N.
The reduction of To with increasing atom number can be understood from the interplay between
the laser phase noise and the quantum projection noise from the atoms. For pure white
√ LO frequency
noise, no optimal probe time exists, since QPN and LO noise both scale as 1/ τ and there is no
need to feed back onto the laser’s frequency, since it already averages down as a clock would. For
LO flicker and random walk frequency noise, the LO noise integrated over the interrogation time
equals that of the atomic QPN noise level near the optimum probe time. Since the QPN reduces
with increasing N, this optimum probe time becomes shorter.
The second noteworthy result is that the instability
√ of a clock with N > 1, operated with the
optimal probe time for each N, deviates from the 1/ N scaling of Equation (7.3) as shown in
Table 7.2. The slight reduction in instability gain as N increases is again a consequence of the
slightly shorter optimum probe times for increasing atom number.

projection noise derived from simulations. For ion (neutral atom) clock candidates with N = 1
(N = 1000) the correction factor is 2 (0.07). Following Peik et al. (2005), we have limited the
maximum probe time to the excited-state lifetime τ0 and loss of contrast from spontaneous emission
is taken into account with a scaling factor exp[−To /(2τ0 )] for the instability. Our results for the
instability are more optimistic compared to Peik et al. (2005).

7.3

Methods to remove instability caused by the Dick effect

The instability of many optical clocks,
√ especially optical lattice clocks for which the QPN level is
extremely low (lower than 10−17 / τ for 104 atoms, and possibly even lower for long interrogation
times of several seconds), is limited by the Dick effect. This is an aliasing effect arising from the
sampling of the clock-laser noise by the clock sequence. This sampling converts the high-frequency
noise of the clock laser (typically from 1 to 100 Hz) into undesirable noise at the frequency of the
clock cycle with an efficiency that decreases when the fraction of the cycle spent probing the atoms
with the clock laser (the “duty cycle”) increases.
Several techniques have been developed in order to reduce the Dick effect. First, better clock
lasers are designed in order to decrease the laser frequency noise. This includes several technical

uncertainty σC at 1 s averaging time for a laser with pure flicker noise with different noise floors σL for

lifetime for each species. The latter represents at the same time the maximum probe time. For ions (atoms)

Figure 7.5. Allan deviation of the frequency difference between the two Sr clocks at SYRTE. When the

systematic effects by a factor of four.

developments, such as long cavities, the use of crystalline coatings, cryogenic silicon cavities, or
more speculative research such as spectral hole burning techniques (see Chapter 1). However,
another way to reduce the Dick effect is to optimise the interrogation of the atoms with the clock
laser, which is generally less demanding than building state-of-the-art clock lasers.
One technique is to probe two separate clocks with the same clock laser, with synchronised
interrogation windows. In this scheme, the clock-laser noise is sampled in the same way by the two
atomic ensembles and is therefore eliminated when computing the frequency difference between
the clocks (Lodewyck et al., 2010; Takamoto et al., 2011). Figure 7.5 shows an experimental
realisation of such a rejection scheme. This method is suitable, e.g., to measure systematic effects
with a short integration time when two clocks are available. It can even be implemented between
clocks that use two different species by using a frequency comb to transfer the spectral purity of the
clock laser over the optical spectrum. When implemented efficiently, the Allan deviation of the
frequency difference between the two samples averages down as 1/τ, starting from the clock-laser
frequency noise and down to the residual noise level of the clock (from detection noise, QPN
or residual instabilities due to uncompensated optical paths). However, this technique has two
drawbacks: first, it does not actually implement a physical oscillator with a reduced instability, and
second, it is not suitable for long-range comparisons over fibre networks as this comparison method
is not capable of transferring the high-frequency noise of the ultra-stable lasers.
A second method is to probe two atomic ensembles with the same clock laser, but with
complementary interrogation windows using Ramsey spectroscopy. These two interleaved atomic
ensembles virtually form a single clock in which the frequency of the clock laser is continuously
measured by atoms, and therefore without any aliasing effect (Lodewyck et al., 2010; Schioppo
et al., 2017). For this, both clocks feed back successively to the clock-laser frequency. Anticorrelations between successive corrections enable the final output to overcome the Dick limit. This
technique can be used for remote-clock comparisons. However, its realisation is experimentally
involved because the dead time in the clock cycle used to prepare and detect the atoms must
be as short as the duration of clock interrogation in order to reach a 50% duty cycle. This can
be achieved by extending the clock interrogation window using a clock laser with a very long
coherence time (Schioppo et al., 2017). However, this defeats the purpose of an interleaved clock
whose advantage is precisely to enable very low instabilities without resorting to complicated
laser-stabilisation techniques.

detect a few hundred atoms.

In the framework of the OC18 project, we designed a clock sequence suitable for a dead-timefree clock by taking advantage of cavity-assisted non-destructive detection of Sr atoms in an optical
lattice clock (Vallet et al., 2017). The exquisite signal-to-noise ratio of this detection, capable of
resolving just a few atoms in the optical lattice, makes it possible to operate the clock with a reduced
number of atoms (a few hundred) without being limited by the detection noise. With this feature,
we were able to demonstrate a workable short clock sequence with a duration of 400 ms and a 50%
duty cycle (see Figure 7.6) that is compatible with the frequency noise of compact ultra-stable laser
systems. Furthermore, this detection technique also makes it possible to reuse the atoms from cycle
to cycle, thus offering the possibility to further reduce the clock dead time. Realisation of a similar
detection scheme in a second clock system is required in order to demonstrate a dead-time-free
clock with enhanced stabilities.

7.4

Interleaved measurement techniques to reduce uncertainty

In order to monitor and then remove frequency shifts arising from the interaction of atoms with
their environment, it is common practice to interleave independent frequency servos to the atomic
transition. The separate servos can be operated with different magnitudes of perturbing fields, such
as magnetic field, probe power etc., and then the frequency shifts can be extrapolated to zero, as
described in Section 7.1.2.
Care should be taken to avoid introducing any errors in the clock frequency from the ordering
of the probes in the interleaved sequence. For example, if the clock laser is drifting linearly in
frequency and is used to probe servo 1 and then servo 2, always in the order of [1, 2], the servos
will experience different frequency offsets compared to the situation of probing the pair of servos
in the reverse order [2, 1]. For a cavity drift of ∼50 mHz/s and 1-s cycles for each servo, the bias
introduced into the clock frequency would be at the level of 1 part in 1016 . Alternating the order of
the servo pairs, so as to average over the sequence [1, 2, 2, 1], would give immunity to linear cavity
drifts. Quadratic drift immunity could then be obtained by additionally reversing the order of these
sequences, so as to average over [1, 2, 2, 1; 2, 1, 1, 2]. Note that similar patterned sequences can also
be used in frequency locking when alternating probes between the high and low frequency sides of
a particular transition (Itano et al., 2007).

7.4.1

Ytterbium-ion E2 and E3 clock transitions

Singly-ionised ytterbium is unique amongst optical frequency standards in that it has two different
transitions that are used as optical clock frequencies: an electric quadrupole transition (E2, 2 S1/2 →
2D
2
2
3/2 ) at 436 nm and an electric octupole transition (E3, S1/2 → F7/2 ) at 467 nm, see Figure 7.7.
The two transitions have different sensitivities to external perturbations and this provides an
opportunity to run interleaved servos with the E2 and E3 transitions exposed to the same external
perturbations, but undergoing different frequency shifts (Godun et al., 2014; Huntemann et al.,

2016). Note that this is different from the previous examples of extrapolating the frequency shifts in
a single transition to zero, but is particularly useful if the shifts in a transition are too small to resolve
directly, such as for the E3 transition. The significantly higher sensitivity of the E2 transition to
electric and magnetic fields permits diagnosis of field-induced shifts of the E3 transition frequency
on a magnified scale. It is essential, of course, to know the relative scaling factors for the frequency
shifts in the E2 and E3 transitions. These are generally measured in auxiliary experiments and the
examples given in Table 7.4 show how much more readily the frequency offsets can be resolved
with the E2 transition.
For continuous monitoring, it would be necessary to interleave an E2 servo cycle with every
E3 servo cycle. This, however, has the undesirable effect of increasing the dead time of the E3
interactions. In practice, it may not be necessary to probe the E2 transition so frequently and a
judgment must be made about the timescale on which different systematic effects are likely to be
varying when choosing how often to monitor shifts with a separate transition.

loop filter that uses spectroscopic information obtained from Yb I the laser frequency is controlled via an
acoustic-optic modulator (AOM) in front of the cavity. For Yb II a digital loop filter controls a frequency
offset with an AOM before the trap.

7.5

Case study of operational practices with Yb+ clocks

Many of the probing techniques described in this chapter have been demonstrated with 171 Yb+
optical clocks at PTB, and tested via a long-term comparison of two systems that differ significantly
in trap geometry, control software and interrogation sequence (see Figure 7.8).
The older clock Yb I employs a spherically symmetric Paul trap (Beaty, 1987), while Yb II uses
an endcap trap design (Schrama et al., 1993; Stein, 2010). For the latter clock system a new control
software has recently been developed that is based on MATLAB and uses National Instruments
hardware for digital and analog signals. When referencing the E3 transition, the two clocks utilise
different techniques, described in Section 7.1.3, to cancel the probe-field-induced AC Stark shift.
For Yb I, HRS is performed with interleaved Rabi interrogations to control the step frequency ∆S .
For Yb II, the autobalanced Ramsey technique is implemented. For both systems, a free evolution
period between the Ramsey pulses of about 360 ms is chosen and the contributions to the systematic
uncertainty from the AC Stark shift in each clock are expected to be less than 1 × 10−18 .
As described in Section 7.4.1, the Yb+ E2 transition is used as a sensitive probe of the external
fields for evaluating the E3 field-induced frequency shifts. In order to decide how frequently the E2
transition should be probed, the timescale on which external fields drift should be well understood.
For Yb I, the electric fields need to be corrected on a daily basis to minimise excess micromotion,
whereas the compensation voltages in Yb II remain constant over weeks. This is attributed to
isolator material in the vicinity of the trap in the Yb I setup that is not present in Yb II. Both systems
make use of mu-metal shielding and the magnetic fields have been found to be constant over periods
of several weeks, if the mechanical setup is unchanged. Changes of the optical setup by adding,
removing or changing the position of opto-mechanical components close to the trap, however, lead
to a change in the magnetic field at the position of the ion. This change is compensated by adjusting
the currents through an orthogonal set of coils around the ion’s vacuum chamber. With knowledge
of the timescales on which the external fields change in each trap, the E2 frequency shifts can
be measured at appropriate intervals. Scaling down the magnitude of the frequency shifts for the
E3 transition, it is seen that electric field gradients and magnetic fields contribute no more than
5 × 10−19 to the total frequency uncertainty of the E3 clock.

114

7. Optimised interrogation methods

Besides the characterisation of residual electric and magnetic fields perturbing the ion, the
E2 transition is also well suited for characterising the residual motion of the trapped ion. Here,
measurements of the carrier-to-sideband ratio yield information on residual second-order Doppler
shifts after cooling and during the interrogation. The micromotion part of this shift can also be
inferred from measurements of a correlation between trap drive phase and the arrival of single
photons at the photomultiplier tube (Berkeland et al., 1998; Keller et al., 2015).
In a long-term comparison of the two clocks over a period of six months, with an uptime
of up to 95% per day, we found an agreement of the clock frequencies within the combined
systematic uncertainty ofp4 × 10−18 (Sanner et al., 2019). The observed frequency instability
averages as 1.4 × 10−15 / τ [s] and reaches a statistical uncertainty below 1 × 10−18 after a total
measurement time of about 25 days, thus giving only a minor contribution to the total uncertainty.
The excellent agreement seen between the two clocks with different-style traps, operating with
different interrogation sequences and in different external fields, demonstrates the applicability of
the techniques presented in this chapter.
