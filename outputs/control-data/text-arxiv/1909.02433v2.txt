Abstract
WTe2, as a type-II Weyl semimetal, has 2D Fermi arcs on the (001) surface in
the bulk and 1D helical edge states in its monolayer. These features have recently
attracted wide attention in condensed matter physics. However, in the
intermediate regime between the bulk and monolayer, the edge states have not
been resolved owing to its closed band gap which makes the bulk states dominant.
Here, we report the signatures of the edge superconductivity by superconducting
quantum interference measurements in multilayer WTe2 Josephson junctions and
we directly map the localized supercurrent. In thick WTe2 ( ~𝟔𝟎 𝐧𝐦) , the
supercurrent is uniformly distributed by bulk states with symmetric Josephson
−
effect ( |𝑰+
𝒄 (𝑩)| = |𝑰𝒄 (𝑩)| ). In thin WTe2 (10 nm), however, the supercurrent
becomes confined to the edge and its width reaches up to 𝟏. 𝟒 𝛍𝐦 and exhibits
−
non-symmetric behavior |𝑰+
𝒄 (𝑩)| ≠ |𝑰𝒄 (𝑩)| . The ability to tune the edge
domination by changing thickness and the edge superconductivity establishes
WTe2 as a promising topological system with exotic quantum phases and a rich
physics.

Introduction
Layered WTe2 was suggested as the first material candidate to be a type-II Weyl
semimetal, where eight separated Weyl points exist in the bulk and topological Fermi
arcs occur on the (001) crystal surfaces owing to the reflection symmetry[1]. An extra
set of quantum oscillations arising from Weyl orbits were observed as evidence of
Fermi arcs in transport[2]. Intriguingly, when the thickness is reduced to the monolayer,
WTe2 turns to be a quantum spin Hall insulator with edge states[3], which have been
demonstrated in numerous experiments involving low-temperature transport[4, 5],
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy[6], scanning tunneling microscopy[7, 8]
and microwave impedance microscopy[9]. Besides, it has also been predicted that WTe2
has 1D hinge states as a higher-order topological insulator[10].
While the boundary modes of WTe2 have been well studied in both the 3D and 2D
limits[11, 12], in multilayers these modes become rather complicated due to the
intervening bulk and edge states and thus they remain largely unexplored. Unlike the
monolayer WTe2, the nearly-closed bandgap in multilayer WTe2 results in a large
density of bulk states. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the edge states through a
gating approach. It is then necessary to make them distinct from the coexisting bulk
ones. However, separating edge and bulk states in a single electrical conductance
measurement may be ambiguous. In contrast, if the charge carriers condense together
to form Cooper pairs, the difference can be amplified since the supercurrent properties
are largely related to the coherence length[13]. A planar microscopic Josephson
junction to realize superconducting TSM is feasible to elucidate the boundary states.
For example, in Nb/Bi2Te3/Nb Josephson junctions the surface states enable the ballistic
Josephson current rather than the diffusive bulk transport[14]. The supercurrent
distribution in real space can be also quantitatively extracted from the superconducting
quantum interference (SQI) measurements, where a perpendicular magnetic field
induces oscillations in the amplitude of the superconducting current in Josephson
junctions. This approach has been widely adopted to reveal the quantum spin Hall edge
states in HgTe quantum well[15], topological surface states in TI[16] and quantum Hall
edge states in graphene[17], but not yet in TSM.
Here, we report the observation of edge superconductivity in multilayer WTe2
Josephson junctions. By varying the thickness of WTe2 in SQI experiments, we have
observed the Fraunhofer and the mixture of Fraunhofer and SQUID pattern in thick and
thin WTe2, respectively, which indicates the edge superconductivity in thin WTe2. The
non-uniform supercurrent exists in multilayer WTe2 up to 16 nm, while the bulk
supercurrent density amplitude (𝐽𝑐 ) is about 1/3 of the edge in the thinnest sample.
|𝐼𝑐+ (𝐵)| ≠ |𝐼𝑐− (𝐵)| is also observed in thin WTe2 due to the inversion symmetry
breaking.
WTe2 Josephson junctions
We measure several Josephson junctions consisting of WTe2 flakes of different
thicknesses contacted by niobium (Nb) leads. The fabrication and characterization
details are described in the Methods and SI Section I (Supplementary Fig. 1-2). A
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the actual device and its measurement
configuration are displayed in Fig. 1a (device #1, 10 nm-thick WTe2). The length and
2 / 13

width of the superconducting channel are 𝐿 = 200 nm and 𝑊 = 13 μm, respectively.
Figure 1b shows the resistance-temperature (R-T) curve of the junction with two
transitions 𝑇𝑐1 and 𝑇𝑐2 at zero magnetic field. 𝑇𝑐1 ~8 K originates from the Nb
superconducting transition, while the resistance continues to drop to 10−3 times of the
normal resistance below 𝑇𝑐2 ~0.72 K which comes from the proximity Josephson
coupling. The Josephson effect is highly reproducible across different devices, as
shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. Figure 1c and its inset display the I-V characteristics
and the differential resistance (d𝑉/d𝐼) of the junction at 45 mK, respectively. From the
slope of the I-V curve in the high bias region (𝐼 > 10 μA) where the curve is linear, the
normal-state resistance 𝑅𝑁 ~1.7 Ω is extracted. For |𝐼| < 4.1 μA, the voltage and
d𝑉/d𝐼 across the junction remain nearly zero, indicating a robust Josephson effect. Ten
WTe2 Josephson junctions with various 𝐿 and 𝑊 are studied (see Table S1 for their
junction parameters), all exhibiting a finite supercurrent at low temperatures with
reproducible behavior. The junction is in the long junction limit[18] (see SI Section IV
and Supplementary Fig. 4 for details). Therefore it follows the 1/𝐿 dependence found
from the 𝐼𝑐 𝑅𝑁 plot versus L in Fig. 1d. In this long junction regime, the critical current
𝐸

is given[18, 19] by 𝐼𝑐 ~ 𝑒𝑅𝑇ℎ , being determined by the Thouless energy 𝐸𝑇ℎ , which can
𝑁

be estimated[20] to be ~ℎ𝑣𝐹 /𝐿, yielding 𝐼𝑐 𝑅𝑁 ∝ 1/𝐿
The superconducting quantum interference measurements
Having established the Josephson effect in our Nb/WTe2/Nb junctions, we then
focus on the supercurrent of WTe2. In our experiments, the spatial distribution of the
supercurrent is analyzed by applying a perpendicular magnetic field B during the SQI
measurements with different thicknesses of WTe2. The particular shape of the critical
current interference pattern depends on the phase-sensitive summation of the
supercurrents traversing the junction. In the case of a symmetric supercurrent
distribution, this integral takes the simple form[21]:
∞

𝐼𝑐𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝐵) = |∫

−∞

𝐽𝑐 (𝑥)cos (

2𝜋𝐿𝑒𝑓𝑓 𝐵𝑥
) d𝑥 |
Φ0

where 𝐿𝑒𝑓𝑓 is the effective length of the junction along the direction of the current,
accounting for the magnetic flux threading[22] through parts of the superconducting
contacts over the London penetration depths. Φ0 = ℎ/2𝑒 corresponds to the magnetic
flux quantum.
In thick WTe2, the bulk states dominate and along the y-axis the supercurrent
density has an approximately uniform distribution as shown in Fig. 2a. Thus, the
uniform current density yields the single-slit Fraunhofer pattern described by[21]
𝐼𝑐 (𝐵) = 𝐼𝑐0 |sin (

𝜋𝐿𝑒𝑓𝑓 𝐵𝑊
Φ0

)/(

𝜋𝐿𝑒𝑓𝑓 𝐵𝑊
Φ0

)|.

We have measured device #8 with 60 nm-thick WTe2 as shown in Fig. 2b. The critical
current envelope has an oscillation characteristic. We obtain a period of ~0.33 mT,
which yields the effective length of 𝐿𝑒𝑓𝑓 = Φ0 /(𝛿𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑒 𝑊)~1.0 μm. This effective
length, larger than the distance between the two Nb electrodes (𝐿 = 240 nm), is caused
by the London penetration depth and the flux focusing due to the Meissner effect[23,
3 / 13

24]. The critical current envelope strongly resembles a single-slit pattern with 2Φ0
central lobe width. The corresponding supercurrent distribution is obtained by
transforming the single-slit pattern to the real-space current density, 𝐽𝑐 (𝑧), as shown in
Fig. 2c. This suggests a nearly uniform supercurrent density throughout the y direction.
The full details of the extraction procedure can be found in the SI section V and
Supplementary Fig. 5. Furthermore, the critical currents overlap each other at different
current directions as shown in Fig. 2d which indicates a symmetric Josephson effect
with |𝐼𝑐+ (𝐵)| = |𝐼𝑐− (𝐵)|, where + and – denote the sweep direction of the bias
current and +𝐵 and – 𝐵 are the magnetic field directions.
When the WTe2 is thinned down to a few layers, the low bulk density of states
coexists with the possible high density at edges as shown in Fig. 2e. The magneticfield-dependent critical current envelope in a 13 nm-thick WTe2 device (device #2)
demonstrates the periodic SQI with a 1.6Φ0 central lobe width (Fig. 2f). 𝐼𝑐 decays
slowly which is distinct from the Fraunhofer pattern in Fig. 2b. We use an edge-stepped
nonuniform supercurrent model to directly simulate the 𝐼𝑐 − 𝐵 relation as shown by
the black line in Fig. 2f (see the model details in SI Section VI and Supplementary Fig.
6). The good fit of both the magnitude and periodicity of 𝐼𝑐 indicates the nonuniform
supercurrent in few-layer WTe2. Furthermore, the mixture of Fraunhofer and SQUID
interference pattern corresponds to the development of sharp peaks in the supercurrent
density at the mesa edges in Fig. 2g. The widths of the supercurrent-carrying edge are
estimated to be in the range 1.3 − 1.4 μm . The value is similar to other edge
superconductivity systems[15, 25] and the additional edge modes or bulk modes
coupled weakly to edge states across the junction to carry supercurrent can result in the
large edge supercurrent channel. The relation of the critical current with the magnetic
field is presented in Fig. 2h and behaves non-symmetric |𝐼𝑐+ (𝐵)| ≠ |𝐼𝑐− (𝐵)| in most
magnetic fields which is different with thick sample.
We have reproduced the edge superconductivity and the mixture of Fraunhofer
and SQUID pattern in 10 nm-thick WTe2 device (#1), and the traditional Fraunhofer
pattern in a 40 nm-thick WTe2 device (#5, see SI Section VII and Supplementary Fig.
7 for details). The higher supercurrent density at edges suggests a robust coupling to
the superconductor electrodes.
To further distinguish the superconducting proximity Josephson coupling of
edge/bulk, we experiment with a 16 nm-thick WTe2 device (#3) to distinguish the bulk
and edge contributions. Two Josephson channels are fabricated as the edge-crossing
(𝑅1 ) and edge-untouched (𝑅2 ) as shown in Fig. 3a. For 𝑅2 , the junction is easier to be
conducted by the bulk because the electrodes are closer in the central region
(𝐿𝑏 ~0.4 μm) while far at the edge. The distance on the edge side is 𝐿𝑠 ~4 μm that
makes it hard to realize the Josephson effect through the edge region. Since the
thickness is uniform in this sample, as indicated by the atomic force microscopy (AFM)
measurement (Supplementary Fig. 2c-d), we can reasonably assume that the resistance
by bulk states is isotropic and inversely proportional to the width. Figure 3b shows the
R-T curve at low temperatures. Only edge-crossing 𝑅1 can reach zero to exhibit
Josephson effect while 𝑅2 only decreases a little. The differential resistance versus the
current measurement in Fig. 3c verifies this property. Since the lengths of two junctions
differ slightly, the coherence length of 𝑅1 should be larger than that of 𝑅2 to realize
4 / 13

the Josephson effect. A similar mixture of Fraunhofer and SQUID pattern with edgedominated supercurrent is also observed, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 7b, which is
consistent with the other two thin devices (#1 and #2). On the contrary, 𝑅2 does not
exhibit any oscillation and only the central lobe is observed (see Supplementary Fig. 8
for details). The width 𝑊2 for 𝑅2 is estimated to be 1.9 μm, which corresponds well
to the actual junction width 1.7 μm as shown in Fig. 3a. The in-complete
superconductivity of 𝑅2 is due to the weaker superconducting combining for bulk. If
the Josephson channel is further shortened, the bulk-only channel 𝑅2 can also be
superconducting in another device #9. However, only the Fraunhofer pattern with
uniform supercurrent density is observed and corresponds well to the bulk-dominated
sample #8 in Fig. 2c-d (see Figs. S8-9 for details).
Discussion
It is necessary to discuss whether the observed edge superconductivity originates
from the edge states in WTe2 or other trivial effects. All of the four different devices
exhibit the sharp edge superconductivity which can exclude the accidental impurity
effect. The exclusion of some trivial effects such as fluctuations and the affection by
the SiO2 substrate and the capping layer in thinner WTe2 is also discussed in
Supplementary Section VIII. However, it is difficult to exclude other trivial effects such
as trivial edge states. Moreover, the other trivial mechanisms can also lead to a similar
non-uniform supercurrent such as an inhomogeneous interface. A mixture of
Fraunhofer and SQUID pattern was also observed in Nb-InGaAs/InP junctions with a
step-shaped current density distribution[26]. Therefore, we need to point out that the
edge superconductivity we observed is not equivalent to the superconductivity in the
edge modes nor any evidence of toplogical superconducting phase. On the contrary,
only the superconductivity in the edge region of samples can be concluded in our
experiments.
The critical currents following |𝐼𝑐+ (𝐵)| ≠ |𝐼𝑐− (𝐵)| in thin WTe2 is quite
interesting. In general, the asymmetric crystal can induce different Fermi velocities at
two sides and results in supercurrent asymmetry. Since the supercurrent density is
uniform as shown in Fig. 2c with symmetric Fraunhofer pattern (Fig. 2d), the bulk WTe2
does not contribute to the asymmetry. Consequently, this supercurrent asymmetry may
be related to the edge which is consistent with the predicted effect of inversionsymmetry-breaking on Weyl semimetal[27]. The total Josephson current carried by the
two edges can be described by[28]
𝐼(Φ, 𝜑) ∝ 𝐼1 sin(𝑛𝜑 + 𝑛Φ) + 𝐼2 sin(𝑛𝜑 − 𝑛Φ)
where 𝐼1 and 𝐼2 represents the Josephson current carried by the two edges, Φ and
𝜑 are the phase in WTe2 ( the magnetic-field-related) and Nb regions (the currentrelated), respectively. The two edges have different energy spectra and 𝐼1 ≠ 𝐼2 in thin
WTe2 (Fig. 2g) which results from different Fermi velocity of the two edge sides,
denoted by the red and blue lines as shown in Fig. 2e. Therefore, the 𝐼(Φ, 𝜑) is not
symmetric for both 𝜑 and Φ anymore. Other possibilities such as vortex trapping,
vortex motion during the magnetic field sweep or bulk states asymmetry may contribute.
However, the |𝐼𝑐+ (𝐵)| = |𝐼𝑐− (𝐵)| in the thick sample in Fig. 2d helps to largely
exclude the other possibility.
5 / 13

We note that two recent preprints[29, 30] has also studied WTe2 Josephson
junction and shown evidence of edge states which is explained to be Hinge states[10].
Indeed, it is challenging to unambiguously determine the definite origin of edge
superconductivity in our results, and various possibilities exist. However, from the
consistent observations of high edge supercurrent density[29], the edge
superconductivity is confirmed in the multi-layer WTe2 system. Compared to the
reported data, we further perform thickness-dependence experiments and provide more
evidence that edge superconductivity exists in thin WTe2 but not a thick one.
We summarize the supercurrent density amplitude ratio of the edge and bulk in
Fig. 4. The edge superconductivity gradually emerges in thinner ones and the edge/bulk
supercurrent amplitude reaches 2.76 in 10 nm-thick WTe2. The critical thickness for the
transition from edge to bulk-dominated superconductivity is estimated to be 𝑡𝑐 = 16 −
20 nm. Moreover, various topological semimetals such as the TaAs family[31] (Fermiarc surface states), layered MoTe2[32] (edge states in the 2D limit) and ZrSiS[33]
(nodal-line surface states) can be further fabricated into Josephson junctions to detect
the surface/edge states.
Conclusion
In summary, by studying the Fraunhofer interference, our measurements provide
the supercurrent distribution in type-II Weyl semimetal WTe2. In thin WTe2, the
existence of edge superconductivity is evidenced. Besides, non-symmetric behavior
𝐼𝑐+ (𝐵) ≠ 𝐼𝑐− (𝐵) in WTe2 through the edge is an intrinsic property of the inversion
symmetry breaking, which is distinct from other systems by an external in-plane
magnetic field[22]. Furthermore, the Josephson junctions formed from 1D edge states
or 2D surface states and s-wave superconducting contacts are expected to emulate
spinless p-wave superconductivity[34] and Majorana flat bands[35] via a.c. Josephson
effect by Shapiro response measurements. Edge superconductivity establishes WTe2 as
a promising platform for the future realization of topological superconductivity and
Majorana bound states.
Methods
WTe2 crystal growth
High-quality bulk WTe2 crystals were grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT)
method as reported before[36]. Single crystals of WTe2 were grown by a hightemperature self-flux method. High-purity tungsten powders (99.9%) and Te pieces
(99.999%) were inserted into alumina crucibles with a molar ratio of 1:30 in a glove
box filled with pure argon then sealed in quartz tubes under high vacuum. The tubes
were heated to 1100 °C in 20 hours and maintained for 10 hours. Then the furnace was
slowly cooled down to 650 °C with a rate of 2 °C/h followed by separating the Te flux
in a centrifuge at 650 °C.
Device fabrication
The WTe2 flakes were mechanically exfoliated onto a Si substrate capped with a 280
nm-thick SiO2 layer and the thickness of WTe2 was identified by optical contrast and
atomic force microscopy. The WTe2 Josephson junctions were fabricated by an e-beam
lithography technique and wet-etched by standard buffered HF solution for 5 s in the
6 / 13

electrode regime. We deposited 120 nm-thick Nb electrodes using magnetic sputtering.
Then, 40 nm-thick SiO2 was deposited on top to prevent the WTe2 oxidization.
Transport measurements
Four-terminal temperature-dependent transport measurements were carried out in a
Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design) with a dilution
refrigerator, which achieves a base temperature of 35 mK. The transport properties were
acquired using lock-in amplifiers (SR830) and Agilent 2912 meters. We used an
excitation current of <50 nA. In differential resistance (dV/dI) measurements, a small
a.c. current bias (10 nA to 100 nA) is generated by the lock-in amplifier output voltage
in combination with a 10 MΩ bias resistor. This small a.c. current is added on top of
the larger d.c. current bias by Agilent 2912, and the induced differential voltage is
measured using the lock-in technique with a low frequency (<50 Hz).
