The parton distribution functions (PDFs) of heavy mesons are evaluated from their light-front
wave functions, which are obtained from a basis light-front quantization in the leading Fock sector
representation. We consider the mass eigenstates from an effective Hamiltonian consisting of the
confining potential adopted from light-front holography in the transverse direction, a longitudinal
confinement, and a one-gluon exchange interaction with running coupling. We present the gluon
and the sea quark PDFs which we generate dynamically from the QCD evolution of the valence
quark distributions.

INTRODUCTION

Heavy quarkonium is a multiscale system with all
regimes of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The perturbative expansion in the strong coupling constant
αs (µ2 ) is possible at high energies; however, at low energies, nonperturbative effects dominate. Heavy quarkonium provides an ideal platform for testing the interplay
between perturbative and nonperturbative QCD within
a data-rich regime. Production of heavy quarkonium,
i.e. charmonium (cc̄) and bottomonium (bb̄), takes place
via initial partonic scattering processes with large momentum transfer on a time scale of ~/(2m[c,b] c2 ), where
m is the mass of the quark [1]. Enormous progress has
been made on cc̄ and bb̄ decays, showing that many measurements of branching fraction, width, and spectra have
attained high precision (see Ref. [2] and the references
therein). However, data on the Bc meson (bc̄ or cb̄) family, which is unique since they are composed of two flavors
of heavy quark and antiquark, are relatively scarce. So
far, the ground state and its first radial excitation are
confirmed in experiments [3, 4]. Meanwhile, creations of
a large ensemble of heavy mesons are expected from ongoing and forthcoming high energy experiments, e.g. Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), attracting dedicated theoretical efforts for
understanding their structure [5–13].
In contrast to light mesons, heavy quarkonia are ar-

guably among the simplest mesons. The constituent
quark and antiquark are quite heavy and move rather
slowly inside the meson bound states. These two essential
features ensure the hierarchical structure of the intrinsic energy scales of a quarkonium. The influential nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization approach [14]
fully employs this scale hierarchy and allows us to efficiently separate the relativistic and perturbative contributions from the long-distance and nonperturbative
dynamics. Unlike the parton distribution amplitudes
(PDAs) for light mesons which are totally nonperturbative objects, the PDA for heavy mesons can be factorized
into a product of a perturbatively calculable distribution
part and a NRQCD matrix-element for the vacuum to
hadron state transition at the lowest order in velocity
expansion [15, 16]. The profile of the quarkonium PDA
is fully acquiescent to perturbation theory. Although the
heavy quarkonium PDAs have become objects of intensive study [9, 11, 12, 15–27], there is limited knowledge of
parton distribution functions (PDFs) of heavy mesons.
PDFs, appearing in the description of hard inclusive
reactions like deep inelastic scattering (DIS), play important roles in understanding the structure of hadrons.
PDFs encode the distribution of longitudinal momentum
and polarization carried by the constituents. There are
many experiments and theoretical investigations on this
subject and it remains an active field of research over
many years. For example, the measurement of the inclusive charm (c) and bottom (b) quark cross sections in
DIS at DESY-HERA uniquely constrains the PDFs of the
proton, in particular, its b and c content [28]. The predictions of the inclusive production of W and Z bosons,
are sensitive to the theoretical treatment of heavy quarks
[29–49]. The bottom quark PDF is crucial in Higgs production at the LHC in both the Standard Model and in
extensions to the Standard Model [50–54]. The PDFs of
heavy quarks within the nucleon have been extensively

2
investigated, however, little is known from either theory
or experiment about the PDFs of the heavy mesons, although this situation is likely to change with the new
LHC and RHIC programs on heavy mesons.
In this paper, we evaluate the unpolarized PDFs of
heavy quarkonia and Bc mesons using the light-front
wave functions (LFWFs) based on a basis light-front
quantization (BLFQ) approach [55] where only the leading Fock sector has been considered. In the effective
Hamiltonian, we choose the confining potential adopted
from the light-front holography in the transverse direction [56], a longitudinal confinement [10], and a one-gluon
exchange interaction with a running coupling. The nonperturbative solutions for the LFWFs are provided by
the recent BLFQ study of heavy quarkonia [11] and Bc
mesons [12]. The LFWFs have been successfully applied
to compute the decay constants, r.m.s. radii, distribution amplitudes, electromagnetic form factor etc. of
heavy mesons [11, 12]. We extend our investigations
to study the QCD evolution of the heavy meson PDFs
in order to obtain the gluon and the sea quark distributions. Most of the gluons and sea quarks are expected to be produced dynamically by the scale evolution. Here, we consider only the leading Fock sectors
of the Fock state expansion for the quarkonia and Bc
meson states. We use the Dokshitzer-Gribov-LipatovAltarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) equation of QCD [57–59] up to
the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for the evolution of the valence quark PDFs and obtain the gluon and
the sea quark PDFs. Since, the DGLAP evolution is applicable in the perturbative regime, the large mass scales
of heavy mesons justify the use of the QCD evolution.
Studying the DGLAP evolution of heavy quark PDFs
provides rich information about the gluon and sea quark
appearing in higher Fock sectors (such as q q̄g and q q̄ q̄q).
Our study thereby provides guidance for the structure of
heavy mesons at higher scales.
The paper is organized as follows. We discuss the
BLFQ formalism for heavy meson systems in Sec. II. The
PDFs of heavy mesons have been evaluated in Sec. III.
The scale evolution of the heavy quarkonium and Bc me-

son PDFs has also been discussed in this section. We
summarize in Sec. IV.

BASIS LIGHT-FRONT QUANTIZATION

BLFQ approach is developed for solving many-body
bound-state problems in quantum field theory [10, 55,
60]. It is a Hamiltonian-based formalism which takes advantage of light-front dynamics [61]. This approach has
been successfully applied to quantum electrodynamics
(QED) systems such as the single electron problem [62],
as well as the strong coupling bound-state positronium
problem [60] and QCD systems such as the running coupling quarkonium problem [11]. It has also been applied
to the Bc mesons [12]. Recently, the BLFQ approach using a Hamiltonian that includes the color singlet Nambu–
Jona-Lasinio interaction to account for the chiral dynamics has been applied to the light mesons [63–65]. Furthermore, the BLFQ formalism has been extended to timedependent strong external field problems such as nonlinear Compton scattering [66]. (For the reviews related to
BLFQ and its other application, see Refs. [67–75].)
The effective light-front Hamiltonian for the heavy meson consists of the light-front kinetic energy with a harmonic oscillator confining potential in the transverse direction, based on the light-front holography, as well as
a longitudinal confining potential, and the one-gluon exchange interaction with a running coupling. In a lightfront Hamiltonian approach [55], a recent study of heavy
meson presents the effective Hamiltonian as [10–12],
Heff = Tq + Tq̄ + Vconf + VOGE ,

(1)

where Tq(q̄) is the kinetic energy of the quark (antiquark).
Vconf represents the confining potential which includes
both the transverse and the longitudinal confinements
and VOGE is the one-gluon exchange term. In the second
quantized form, the effective Hamiltonian can be written
in momentum-space variables as,

employ the running coupling αs (Q2 ) based on the 1-loop
perturbative QCD. A finite vector boson mass µg = 0.02
GeV has been introduced to regularize the integrable
Coulomb singularity [11]. The Q2 in the denominator
of the boson exchange interaction arises from the cancellation of the light-front small-x divergences which appear
in the instantaneous vector boson-exchange interaction.
A detailed discussion about the cancellation of the instantaneous interaction in the effective vector-boson exchange interaction can be found in Ref. [60].

In light-front holography, the confinement κ4 ζ⊥
is introduced in the massless case. For heavy mesons, the
quark masses and the longitudinal dynamics cannot be
neglected and thus, a longitudinal confining potential
(third term in Eq. (2) [10]) has been introduced to complement the transverse holographic confinement. We
combine the holographic potential and one-gluon exchange interaction to govern the long distance as well
as the short distance physics. Here, we retain only contributions to the effective Hamiltonian which are relevant
to the simplest Fock space. Note that the Dirac matrix
structure of the two confining potentials is the identity
matrix. However, we manifest them only with the good
(independent) component of the quark fields. The Hamiltonian is expressed only in terms of the independent degrees of freedom which are conventionally selected to be
the Pauli spinors. The dependent degrees of freedom are
accessible through the equations of motion [60].

The coefficients of the expansion, ψλq λJq̄ (~k⊥ , x), are the

To evaluate the Hamiltonian matrix, one needs to construct the basis. In order to construct the basis, the twodimensional (2D) harmonic oscillator (HO) functions are
adopted in the transverse direction, which are defined in

The initial PDFs of heavy mesons

LFWFs play a central role in evaluating hadronic observables and light-cone distributions, and are an essential tool for investigating exclusive processes in DIS.
PDFs control the inclusive processes at large momentum
transfer [77]. The quark PDF, q(x, µ), is the probability
of finding a collinear quark carrying momentum fraction
x up to scale µ. In the light-front formalism, the PDF
of the meson state with mJ = 0 can be evaluated by integrating out the transverse momentum of the squared

which are normalized superpositions of these basis states,
also satisfy these sum rules. These sum rules are therefore explicitly satisfied for all choices of basis space cutoffs.

Here, we consider eight heavy quarkonium states which
include two scalar particles (ηc (1S), ηb (1S)), four vector particles, and two tensor particles with mJ = 0.
J/ψ(1S), ψ(2S) and Υ(1S), Υ(2S) are the radially excited states with J = 1, whereas χc2 (1P) and χb2 (1P)
are the tensor states for J = 2. In order to study the
PDFs of heavy mesons with unequal quark masses, we
also consider three Bc meson states: Bc (1S), Bc (2S) and
Bc (1P). It should be noted that for the systems with

6
J ≥ 1, there exists more than one PDF depending on
the polarizations of the active quark as well as the system. For example, for spin-1 hadrons, there is also the
well known tensor polarized PDF which is defined as
b1 (x) = (2qmJ =0 (x)−qmJ =1 (x)−qmJ =−1 (x))/4. The tensor polarized PDF b1 (x), being sensitive to the parton’s
orbital angular momentum, attracts significant theoretical as well as experimental attention [78–88]. We focus
on the unpolarized PDFs in this work. A detailed analysis of all other PDFs of vector and tensor particles in our
BLFQ approach will be reported in a future study.
In Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b, we show the unpolarized
PDFs of charmonium (ηc (1S), J/ψ(1S), ψ(2S), χc2 (1P))
and bottomonium (ηb (1S), Υ(1S), Υ(2S), χb2 (1P)) states
evaluated using the LFWFs for Nmax = Lmax = 8 and
Nmax = Lmax = 32, respectively. The chosen basis
functions: Nmax = 8 for charmonium and Nmax = 32
for bottomonium √
roughly correspond to UV regulator
µh = ΛU V ∼ κ Nmax ≈ 1.7mq for quarkonia and
mh + mh̄ for Bc . Our choice of the regulators of the
basis functions is motivated by the competition between
the necessities for both a better basis resolution and a
lower UV scale since the present model does not incorporate radiative corrections [11]. It is interesting to note
that the PDFs for ηc (1S) and J/ψ(1S) exhibit a similar behavior; however, the PDFs for ψ(2S) and χc2 (1P)
show a distinctly different behavior from the other two.
There appear to be ripples on the downward slopes of the
PDFs for ψ(2S) whereas there is a dip at x = 1/2 in the
PDF of χc2 (1P) which may be expected from contributions of longitudinally excited basis functions. The qualitative behavior of bottomonium 1S (ηb and Υ), 2S (Υ)
and 1P (χb2 ) states is more or less the same as charmonium 1S (ηc and J/ψ), 2S (ψ), and 1P (χc2 ) states.
However, the width of the distributions for charmonium
is larger compared to that for bottomonium. This is expected due to the smaller masses of charmonium states
than the bottomonium masses. Furthermore, at a larger
mass scale, the running coupling is smaller which leads
to the smaller kinetic energy in bottomonium. Thus, the
probability of carrying small longitudinal momentum by
the quark/antiquark in bottomonium is always small and
the probability is higher when they share equally momentum. Effectively, the momentum space distributions are
narrower in bottomonium systems than that in charmonium.
The valence quark PDFs of three Bc meson states at
the chosen hadronic scale are shown in Fig. 1c. The
peaks of the charm quark PDFs appear at lower x,
whereas due to the heavier mass, the bottom quark distributions have the peaks at higher x. We also observe that
although the PDFs of Bc (1S) and Bc (2S) show a similar
behavior, the PDF of Bc (1P) exhibits a somewhat different character reminiscent of the 1P states shown in panels
(a) and (b) of Fig. 1. Note that Bc (2S) is broader than
Bc (1S) as may be expected. This is to be compared with
charmonium state ψ(2S) and bottomonium state Υ(2S)
which, in addition, have ripples on the downward slopes.

QCD evolution of heavy meson PDFs

By performing the QCD evolution, the valence quark
PDFs at high scale can be obtained with the input valence PDFs at the initial scale. The DGLAP [57–59]
equation, which bridges PDFs between a final scale and
an initial scale, is given by,


∂
q(x, µ)
∂ ln µ2 g(x, µ)



Z
αs (µ2 ) 1 dy Pqq (x/y) Pqg (x/y)
q(y, µ)
=
,
Pgq (x/y) Pgg (x/y)
g(y, µ)
2π
x y
(15)
where Pqq (z), Pqg (z), Pgq (z) and Pgg (z) are the splitting
kernels. Here, we adopt the DGLAP equations of QCD
up to NNLO, to evolve our PDFs from the model scales
(µ0  ΛQCD ), to higher scales (µ). The QCD evolution
allows quarks to emit and absorb gluons, with the emitted gluons allowed to create quark-antiquark pairs as well
as additional gluons. In this picture, the sea quark and
gluon components of the constituent quarks are revealed
at higher scale through QCD evolution. Here, we use the
higher order perturbative parton evolution toolkit (HOPPET) to numerically solve the NNLO DGLAP equations [89]. The large mass scales of heavy mesons provide
grounds for the usage of perturbative evolution.
We evolve the PDFs of charmonia: ηc (1S), J/ψ(1S),
ψ(2S), χc2 (1P), bottomonia: ηb (1S), Υ(1S), Υ(2S),
χb2 (1P), and Bc mesons: Bc (1S), Bc (2S), Bc (1P) obtained in the basis function representation. As mentioned
above, the initial scale µ0 of the PDF is chosen as a
low UV cutoff µh to suppress the radiative corrections.
Specifically, we adopt the UV cutoffs for Nmax = 8 for
charmonia and Nmax = 32 for bottomonia as well as Bc
mesons [11, 12]. For a comprehensive study, we also vary
the initial scales by choosing µ0 = mq and µ0 = 2µh .
The difference in results is an indicator of the sensitivity
with respect to the choice of the initial scale. The initial
scales are given in Table II. The PDFs are evolved to final scales 20, 80, and 1500 GeV which are the relevant
scales for the proposed Electron Ion Collider in China
(EicC) [90], the electron-Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(eRHIC) [91], and the proposed Large Hadron Electron
Collider (LHeC) [92], respectively. Here, we consider the
range x ≥ 10−3 . We expect that at low initial scale the
DGLAP evolution with a leading twist is not sufficient
at low x [93, 94] and one needs to consider the higher
twist corrections in the DGLAP equation [95–101]. It
should be mentioned here that there is also uncertainty
from the longitudinal basis resolution within the initial
scale PDFs. The uncertainty is proportional to 1/Lmax
and would propagate to the PDFs at final scales.
We demonstrate the evolution of the PDFs of the charmonia and bottomonia states from the initial scales to
the relevant Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) scales in Fig. 2
and Fig. 3, respectively. We observe that for both the
charmonium and the bottomonium, their valence quark
distributions increase slowly at lower x but decrease at

different final scales µ. The initial scale of the PDFs for the basis truncations Nmax = 32 is the UV cutoff µ0 = 7.90 GeV. The
bands represent the range of the distributions for the initial scales µ0 = mq to 2µh . The lines with different color correspond to
the different final scales: µ1 = 20 GeV (blue), µ2 = 150 GeV (green), and µ3 = 1500 GeV (red). The solid, thick long-dashed,
dashed, and dashed double-dot lines represent to the x-PDFs of valence quark, gluon, sea quark (u/d/s/c/b), and sea quark
(t), respectively.

higher x, e.g. x > 0.3, with the scale evolution. The
gluon and the sea quark PDFs at low x increase much
faster than the valence quark PDFs. Effectively, in the
low x region the distributions are mainly dominated by
the gluon PDFs, whereas at large x the valence quark
dominates the distributions. The PDFs for gluon, sea
quark (u/d/s/c), sea quark (b), and sea quark (t) shown
in these plots, are generated by the QCD evolution of the
valence quark PDFs. The bands in those figures represent the range of the distributions for the initial scales
µ0 = mq to 2µh , while the lines correspond to the UV
cutoff for the basis truncations chosen as the initial scales.
The different scales of the PDFs have been represented
by different colors in those figures (left panels). One can
notice that the qualitative behavior of the gluon and the
sea quarks PDFs obtained by the evolution in both the
charmonia and the bottomonia states is very similar.
The evolution of the valence b and c̄ quark PDFs in the

Bc meson state, Bc (1S) is demonstrated in Fig. 4a and
Fig. 4b, respectively. The PDFs for gluon, sea quarks,
generated by the QCD evolution of the valence quark
PDFs are also presented in Fig. 4a. Since the masses of
the b and c quarks are very different, the peaks of their
distributions appear at different x. Again, we observe
that the gluon distribution dominates at low x while,
at large x, the distribution is dominated by the valence
quark distribution. We notice that other two Bc meson
states, Bc (2S) and Bc (1P) exhibit a similar behavior as
the PDF of Bc (1S) in Fig. 4 with QCD evolution.
The first moments of the corresponding PDFs of charmonium, bottomonium, and Bc meson as functions of µ
are shown in Fig. 5. For the demonstration purposes, we
consider the J/ψ(1S), Υ(1S), and Bc (1S) states. We find
that with increasing scale µ, the momentum carried by
the valence quark decreases and the contributions of the
sea quarks and gluon to the total momentum increase.

Due to heavier mass, at a particular scale, the momentum carried by b quark is larger compared to c̄ quark in
the Bc meson. However, the qualitative behaviors of the
total moments of valence quarks, sea quarks, and gluons
in all heavy meson are alike.
To further explore the basis truncation effect, we compare the PDFs calculated from the leading basis function
that excludes the one-gluon exchange effects and is reminiscent of light-front holography [102]. We present a
comparative study of the BLFQ results with our simulation in a light-front holography-inspired model results
for the J/ψ(1S) PDF. We compare the initial scale PDFs
within our BLFQ and the light-front holographic model
(LFHM) in the left panel of Fig. 6, whereas in the right
panel of Fig. 6, the evolved PDFs at the scale relevant
to eRHIC, 80 GeV, are compared. In the LFHM, the
valence quark and antiquark together carry the entire
light-front momentum of the J/ψ(1S) at the initial scale.
Thus, we use the same initial scale as BLFQ for our simulation of the LFHM. We observe that our initial scale
PDF is wider than that in the LFHM. Meanwhile, the
evolved PDFs exhibit good agreement at low x, however,
there is a discrepancy between these two models at large
x. For further investigation, we evaluate the four lowest
nontrivial moments of the valence quark PDFs for the
J/ψ(1S). In Fig. 6 (lower panel), we show these results
as a function of µ and compare with our simulation of the
LFHM for the J/ψ(1S). The results are in good agreement. The four lowest nontrivial moments of Υ(1S), and
Bc (1S) at different scales are shown in Fig. 7.
It is interesting to note that at low x, the x-PDFs
behave like xa where a > 0 for the valence quark, while
for the sea and the gluon, a > −1. With the increasing
scale µ, a decreases and at the limit, µ → ∞, a → 0 for
the valence quark, and for the sea quark and the gluon,
a → −1. This phenomenon is independent of the PDFs
at the initial scale. To demonstrate the low x behavior
of the gluon and the sea quarks PDFs with increasing
scales, we consider J/ψ(1S) x-PDFs at low x, xf (x) ∼ xa
and show the behavior of a as a function of µ in Fig. 8.
We notice that with increasing scale, a falls, steadily,
faster for the gluon than that for the sea quarks. This
phenomenon again implies that the gluon dominates the
distribution at low x as the scale increases.

SUMMARY

We presented a comprehensive study of the PDFs using the wave functions of a light-front model for quarkonium that incorporates light-front holography and the
one-gluon exchange interaction with running coupling.
The LFWFs have been obtained by using the BLFQ approach. We presented the results for the PDFs of ηc (1S),
J/ψ(1S), ψ(2S), χc2 (1P) (charmonium), ηb (1S), Υ(1S),
Υ(2S), χb2 (1P) (bottomonium), and Bc (1S), Bc (2S),
Bc (1P) (Bc meson) states. We observed that the qualitative behavior of charmonium 1S (ηc and J/ψ), 2S (ψ),

and 1P (χc2 ) states is similar to their corresponding bottomonium 1S (ηb and Υ), 2S (Υ) and 1P (χb2 ) states.
But, due to the smaller masses of charmonium compared
to bottomonium, the width of the distributions is larger
for charmonium. For bottomonium and charmonium, the
PDFs are symmetric about x = 0.5, while the peak moves
to a different x region following the naive mass fraction of
the respective constituent quark mass to the total meson
mass for the unequal constituent masses in Bc .
The QCD scale evolution of the heavy quark PDFs,
which provides us with the knowledge of the gluon and
the sea quark distributions, has also been investigated.
We found that although the valence quark dominates at
the large x(> 0.1) region, at the small x region the distributions are mainly dominated by the gluon distribution.
The momenta carried by the sea quark and gluon increase with increasing scale µ. We observed that there is
some sort of universality of the gluon PDFs from different states. Overall, the QCD evolution of heavy quark
PDFs provides predictions for a wealth of information of
the gluon and the sea quarks appearing in higher Fock
sectors. For further improvement, future developments
should focus on the inclusion of higher Fock sectors to
explicitly incorporate sea quark and gluon degrees of freedom at appropriate initial scales. Our work provides
a prediction of the expected data for heavy quarkonia
PDFs from the future experiments as well as a guidance
for the theoretical investigations of the PDFs with higher
Fock components.
