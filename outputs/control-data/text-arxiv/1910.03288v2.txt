In the case of a spatially flat Friedmann–Lemaı̂tre–Robertson–Walker Universe in f (R)-gravity
we write the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of quantum cosmology. The equation depends upon the
functional form of f (R). We choose to work with four specific functions of f (R) in which the
field equations for the classical models are integrable and solvable through quadratures. For these
models we determine similarity solutions for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation by determining LieBäcklund transformations. In addition we show how the classical limit is recovered by the similarity
solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.

INTRODUCTION

Modified theories of gravity [1, 2] are an alternate approach to the dark energy models to explain recent observational
phenomena [3–6]. The common characteristic of the modified theories of gravity is the modification of the EinsteinHilbert Action by adding new invariant terms to the gravitational Action. The novelty of that approach is that
new geometrodynamical components are introduced into the field equations which drive the dynamics to explain the
observations.
In the literature there have been proposed a plethora of different modified theories of gravity. A specific class of
models which have drawn the attention are the so-called f −theories. In f −theories of gravity a function f (Q) is
introduced into the Einstein-Hilbert Action, where Q is an invariant
Some theories which belong to that
 function.

class of models are the: f (R)-gravity in the metric formalism [7], f R̂ -gravity in the Palatini formalism [8], f (G)-

Gauss Bonnet theory [9], while in the Teleparallel formalism of gravity the f (T ) −theory has been widely studied
the last decade [10–13]. For other modified theories which belong to that class we referee the reader to [14–28] and
references therein.
In this work we are interested in f (R)-gravity in the
R metric
√ formalism [29], where Action Integral in a fourdimensional manifold is given by the expression S = dx4 −gf (R). In this theory, variable R corresponds to
the Ricci scalar of the underlying geometry with line element gµν ; consequently, General Relativity with or without
the cosmological constant is fully recovered when f (R) is a linear function. Various specific functional forms of
f (R) −theory have been proposed in the literature in order to describe the various phases of the universe. The
quadratic model f (R) = R + αR2 can describe well the inflationary era of our universe [30, 31]. The natural
extension of the latter inflationary model is the f (R) = R + αRn model [36] which provides power-law attractors. For
other f (R)-models with applications in the late acceleration phase of the universe see [32–35] and references therein.
f (R) −theory is a fourth-order theory and it is dynamical equivalent to the Brans-Dicke theory with zero value for
the Brans-Dicke parameter. The scalar field attributes the extra degree of freedom such that the theory is written
as a second-order theory but with extra dependent variables so that the total degrees of freedom are the same.
The theory is nonlinear and there are few exact solutions, either for spacetimes with one free function such as the
Friedmann–Lemaı̂tre–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW) which is usually applied in modern cosmology. Indeed, in
the case of a spatially flat FLRW spacetime the de Sitter solution, R = R0 , is recovered when there exists a solution
to the algebraic equation R0 f ′ (R0 ) = 2f (R0 ) [31]. In addition, power law solutions, which describe an ideal gas
with constant equation parameter, are recovered when f (R) = f0 Rn , n 6= 0, 1, 2. However, the latter exact solutions
do not describe the generic analytic solution for the corresponding field equations because they are valid only for
specific initial conditions. Some analytic solutions have been found by searching for conservation laws for the field
equations and making a conclusion about the integrability of the gravitational model by writing the analytic solution
with the use of closed-form functions or making use of theorems from the theory of Analytic Mechanics, for instance
see [38–41].

We focus on the determination of exact solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WdW) equation [42] in f (R)-cosmology.
The WdW equation is mainly applied in quantum cosmology. Recall that in modern cosmology we assume that the
spacetime is described by the FLRW metric with zero spatial curvature. WdW is an equation of Klein-Gordon type,
where the dependent variable is denoted to describe the wavefunction of the universe and the independent variables
are the dynamical variables of the classical system. There are various issues such that there is not a unique way
for one to define probability [43, 44]. Also there is the so-called problem of time, because time is involved in the
wavefunction through the dynamical variables [45–48].
A previous analysis of the exact solutions of WdW in f (R)-cosmology was published in [49–51]. Specifically in
3
[49] there was found that for the special power-law theory f (R) = R 2 , the classical solution can be recovered from
3
the solution of the WdW equation. The case f (R) = R 2 describes an integrable cosmological model which admits
a conservation law linear in the momentum. That approach has been extended and applied in other gravitational
models, such as anisotropic universes [44], static spherical symmetric spacetimes [52–54], inhomogeneous spacetimes
[55] and electromagnetic three-dimensional pp-wave spacetimes [56].
In our consideration we determine a family of Lie-Bäcklund transformations for the WdW equation for some specific
models of f (R)-cosmology. The models of f (R)-cosmology that we study form integrable dynamical systems where the
conservation laws which ensure the integrability are constructed by point transformations which leave the variational
integral invariant. The plan of the paper is as follows.
In Section 2 we present the basic equations of f (R)-cosmology. The main mathematical materials necessary for
the analysis of the present work are given in Section 3. Specifically, we show how Lie-Bäcklund transformations can
be constructed for the conformally invariant Klein-Gordon equation by using the point symmetries of the classical
Hamiltonian system. In addition we show how the Lie-Bäcklund operators are applied in order to determine similarity
solutions for the WdW equation. The context of the one-dimensional optimal system is discussed. Section 4 includes
the main material of our analysis. For four integrable classical models of f (R)-cosmology we write the WdW equation
and we determine the infinitesimal generators of the point transformations where the WdW equation is invariant.
From the infinitesimal generators we construct the Lie-Bäcklund operators and we find the similarity solutions. In
order our results to be completed the one-dimensional optimal system is determined for each model. For the models
of our study we observe that the classical limit is always recovered. Finally in Section 5, we discuss our results and
we draw our conclusions.

Wheeler-DeWitt equation

For the second-rank tensor (13) we calculate n = 2, which means that ∆L = ∆. The conformal Laplace operator
∆L has the property that it is invariant under conformal transformations, such a requirement it is necessary in the
case of quantum cosmology since the theory should be conformal invariant because of the arbitance of the lapse
function N (t). While in the case where n = 2 operator ∆L follows from the canonical quantization PA ≃ √1G ∂q∂A , for
higher-dimensional spaces, n ≥ 3, the conformal Laplace operator ∆L follows from the canonical quantization only

for conformally flat spaces, and in general the term 4(n−1)
R should be added by hand. However, which quantization
process which provides the operator ∆L for n ≥ 3 from a point-Lie Hamiltonian function is still an open problem.
In general and in terms of the 1+3 decomposition notation of GR the WdW equation it follows from the Hamiltonian

Condition (33) provides a constraint equation which
will be used in the following to solve the WdW equation (28).

The symmetry condition (32) where ξ A q B is a conformal vector field of the minisuperspace has been found
before in [38] for the variational symmetries for singular Lagrangians of the form of (11). Indeed, for every variational
symmetry of (11) a Lie point symmetry and consequently a Lie-Bäcklund can be constructed for the WdW equation
(28). However, that it is not the only relation between variational symmetries of classical Lagrangians and Lie
symmetries of the WdW equation.
If we consider that the lapse-function N (t) in the Lagrangian (11) is fixed, then we can apply the results for the
variational symmetries of regular Lagrangians [39]. As we shall see for the f (R)-theory we recover the results of [61]
while also we found new Lie-Bäcklund operators which will be used to determine new similarity solutions for equation
(28).
However, the Lie point symmetries of regular systems can be time-dependent, something which is not true for
the WdW equation. Below we show two cases of important interest where we show how Lie-Bäcklund operators are
constructed by using the time-dependent symmetries of the regular Lagrangian.
3.1.

Higher-order Lie-Bäcklund operators

We show, for two models of special interest, how to construct Lie-Bäcklund operators for the conformal Laplace
equation (23) by using time-dependent point symmetries of regular Lagrangians.

can construct the time-dependent conservation laws

One-dimensional optimal system

However, Lie symmetries are used to find new similarity solutions for other similarity solutions by applying the
adjoint representation of the admitted Lie group for the given differential equations. Hence, it is important to
determine the one-dimensional optimal system for the admitted Lie algebra for the equation of our study. In that
case we will determine all the unique similarity solutions which can not derived by adjoint transformation. In the
following we give the definition of the adjoint operator as also when two Lie point symmetries are connected through

SIMILARITY SOLUTIONS OF THE WHEELER-DEWITT EQUATION

As we discussed before, in order to solve the WdW equation (28) we will construct differential operators by using
the variational symmetries for the classical system. Such an analysis was performed before in [39] where the unknown
function f (R) which defines the theory is constrained by the requirement the field equations in f (R)-cosmology to
admit conservation laws generated by point symmetries.
In Lagrangian (11) we assume that N (t) = 1. Therefore, for arbitrary function f (R) the dynamical system is
autonomous and admits the point symmetry ∂t . However ,the latter symmetry does not provide any differential
operator for the WdW equation (28).
In addition, there are four specific functions of f (R)-function where Lagrangian (11) is transformed such that the
3
variation of the Action Integral (10) to be invariant. Specifically, the cases we shall study are (A) f (R) = R 2 ; (B)
3
7
7
f (R) = R 8 ; (C) f (R) = (R − 2Λ) 2 and (D) f (R) = (R − 2Λ) 8 . The first two models are power-law models; however
c
models D and E, belong to a family of models which are called Λbc CDM with general form f (R) = Rb − 2Λ [14].
Indeed, model D is the Λ1 32 CDM while model E corresponds to the Λ1 78 CDM.
At this point it is important to mention that because the WdW equation (28) is a linear second-order partial
differential equation, it admits for arbitrary function f (R) the two symmetry vectors XΨ = Ψ∂Ψ and Xb = b (a, R) ∂Ψ ,
in which b (a, R) is a solution of (28). Symmetry Xb denotes the infinity number of solutions for the partial differential
equations. However, Xb plays no role in the derivation of similarity solutions and for that reason we will omit it.

However, under the change of coordinates {a, R} → {z, w} with the relation a = 29 3 z , R = wz the point-like
Lagrangian (50) is simplified as follows,

Consequently, the field equations in the Hamiltonian formalism become

We observe that solutions Ψ̄1 (z, w) , Ψ2 (z, w) and Ψ12 (z, w) are equivalent, hence we have found in total five

However, for the classical system and specifically from (52) the Hamilton-Jacobi equation follows ∂S
∂z ∂w − 9 = 0 with
the constraint equation ∂S
∂z = S0 , which is nothing else than the conservation law ṗz = 0. Consequently, the generic
solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is
S (z, w) = S0 z +

(64)

which is nothing else than the exponent function of the similarity solution Ψ̄1 (z, w). Therefore, we can infer that
solution Ψ̄1 (z, w) is the one which recovers the classical solution where parameter δ is related with the conservation
law pz = S0 .
In addition, we observe that the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is included in solution Ψ̄4 (z, w), but
not in the rest of the solutions,
namely Ψ3 (z, w) and Ψ̄3 (z, w).

We observe that there is not any direct relation between the similarity solutions for the WdW equation and the
Hamilton-Jacobi for the classical system. However, if we focus on the limits of the Bessel functions we shall see that
the classical limit is recovered.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work we focused on the determination of similarity solutions for the WdW equation in quantum cosmology
and more specifically in f (R)-gravity in a spatially flat FLRW universe. The WdW equation is a linear equation of
Klein-Gordon class which by definition is conformal invariant. For the cosmological of our consideration the WdW
equation provides the solution of the wavefunction Ψ in terms of the two indepedent variables of the theory, the scale
factor a (t) and the Ricciscalar R (t).
We recall, that f (R) is a fourth-order theory and the Ricciscalar R (t) has been added as a Lagrangian multiplier
in order to attribute the higher-order derivatives, such that the f (R) −gravity to be of second-order but with more
degrees of freedom. Because of the latter property the theory is dynamical equivalent with scalar-tensor theories while
a point-like Lagrangian description is possible, which is necessary for our approach on the problem.
For the function form of f (R) which specifies the theory, we considered four models which were found before
and are integrable by one-parameter point transformations. Two of the models are power-law while the other two
models belong to the family of Λbc CDM. For these specific models we write the WdW equation and we determine the
infinitesimal generators of the one-parameter transformations where the WdW equations are invariant. We use the
infinitesimal generators to define Lie-Bäcklund operators which are used as constraint equations to solve the WdW
equation. These solutions are called similarity solutions.
A novel observation for the solutions that were found by that approach is that in the classical limit, that is, in the
WKB approximation, the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the classical system is recovered, consequently
the classical limit is recovered. We can say that the similarity solutions which provide the classical limit are preferred.
Indeed there are not initial and boundary conditions to constrain the solutions of the WdW equation, however by the
requirement the similarity solution to provide the classical limit we can construct a family of boundary conditions.
Because a similarity solution is invariant under the infinitesimal transformations which have been applied for the
determination, the boundary conditions should be also invariant under the same infinitesimal transformations [64, 65].
The similarity solutions can be used to define probability, or calculate the quantum potential of Bohmiam mechanics.
However such applications is not the scope of the present work and such analysis will be published elsewhere.
