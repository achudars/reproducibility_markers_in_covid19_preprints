In this work, we investigate what role the redshift drift data of Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will
play in the cosmological parameter estimation in the future. To test the constraint capability of the
redshift drift data of SKA-only, the ΛCDM model is chosen as a reference model. We find that using
the SKA1 mock data, the ΛCDM model can be loosely constrained, while the model can be well
constrained when the SKA2 mock data are used. When the mock data of SKA are combined with
the data of the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the constraints can be significantly
improved almost as good as the data combination of the type Ia supernovae observation (SN), the
cosmic microwave background observation (CMB), and the baryon acoustic oscillations observation
(BAO). Furthermore, we explore the impact of the redshift drift data of SKA on the basis of
SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT in the ΛCDM model, the wCDM model, the CPL model, and the HDE
model. We find that the redshift drift measurement of SKA could help to significantly improve the
constraints on dark energy and could break the degeneracy between the cosmological parameters.
Therefore, we conclude that redshift-drift observation of SKA would provide a good improvement
in the cosmological parameter estimation in the future and has the enormous potential to be one of
the most competitive cosmological probes in constraining dark energy.

INTRODUCTION

The accelerated expansion of the universe has been
discovered and confirmed by cosmological observations
for about twenty years, which is undoubtedly one of the
greatest scientific discoveries in the modern cosmology.
However, the science behind the cosmic acceleration, i.e.,
the nature of dark energy, still remains mysterious for
us. To measure the physical property of dark energy,
one should precisely measure the expansion history of
the universe. Currently, the mainstream way is to measure the cosmic distances (luminosity distance or angular diameter distance) and the corresponding redshifts,
and to establish a distance-redshift relation, by which
constraints on the parameters of dark energy (and other
cosmological parameters) can be made. However, a more
straightforward way is to directly measure the expansion
rate of the universe at different redshifts, although this
measurement is more difficult in the observational cosmology.
With the fast advancement in technology over the past
several decades, the possibility of measuring the temporal variation of astrophysical observable quantities over
a few decades is becoming more and more realistic. This
kind of real-time observations can be called the “realtime cosmology”. The most typical real-time observable
is the redshift drift, which can give a direct measurement
for the expansion rate (namely, the Hubble parameter)
of the universe in a specific range of redshift.
The approach of measuring the redshift drift was first

proposed by Sandage, who suggested a direct measurement of the redshift variation for the extra–galactic
sources [1]. At that time, obviously, such a measurement
was out of reach with the technological limitation of the
day. Then, the method was further improved by Loeb,
who suggested a more realistic way of measuring the redshift drift using Lyman-α absorption lines of the distant
quasars (QSOs) to detect the redshift variation [2]. Loeb
concluded that the signal would be detectable when 100
quasars can be observed over 10 years with a 10-meter
class telescope. Thus, the method of redshift drift measurement is also referred to as the “Sandage-Loeb” (SL)
test.
Based on SL test, the scheduled European Extremely
Large Telescope (E-ELT), a giant 40-meter class optical telescope, is equiped with a high-resolution spectrograph to perform the COsmic Dynamics EXperiment
(CODEX). The experiment is designed to detect the SLtest signals by observing the Lyman–α absorption lines
within the redshift range of 2 . z . 5. The forecast
of using the redshift drift from the E-ELT to constrain
dark energy models has been extensively discussed; see,
e.g., Refs. [3–18]. It has been shown that the redshift
drift in the redshift range of 2 < z < 5 is rather useful
to break the parameter degeneracies generated by other
observations and thus can play an important role in the
cosmological estimation in the future.
Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will soon start construction for the stage of Phase one. Actually, SKA can
also perform the research of real-time cosmology. Instead
of detecting the Lyman-α absorption lines of quasar,
SKA will measure the spectral drift in the neutral hydrogen (HI) emission signals of galaxies to implement
the measurement of redshift drift in the redshift range
of 0 < z < 1. Obviously, the redshift drift data of SKA

2
provide an important supplement to those of E-ELT.
In this work, we will study the real-time cosmology
with the redshift drift observation from SKA. We will
simulate the redshift drift data of SKA and use these
data to constrain cosmological parameters. We have the
following aims in this work: (i) We wish to learn what
extent the cosmological parameters can be constrained to
by using the redshift drift data of SKA-only. (ii) We wish
to learn what will happen when the redshift drift data of
SKA and E-ELT are combined to perform constraints on
cosmological parameters. (iii) We wish to learn what role
the redshift drift data of SKA will play in the cosmological estimation in the future.
We will employ several typical and simple dark energy
models to perform the analysis of this work. We will
consider the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model in this
work, which is the simplest cosmological model and is
able to explain the various current cosmological observations quite well. The wCDM model is the simplest extension to the ΛCDM model, in which the equation-of-state
(EoS) parameter w of dark energy is assumed to be a
constant. The Chevalliear-Polarski-Linder (CPL) [19, 20]
model of dark energy is a further extension to the ΛCDM
model, in which the form of w(a) = w0 + wa (1 − a) with
two free parameters w0 and wa is proposed to describe
the cosmological evolution of the EoS of dark energy.
We will also consider the holographic dark energy (HDE)
model [21] in this work, which is a dynamical dark energy
model based on the consideration of quantum effective
field theory and holographic principle of quantum gravity [22]. In the HDE model, the type (quintessence or
quintom) and the cosmological evolution of dark energy
are solely determined by a dimensionless constant c (note
that this is not the speed of light) [23]. For more detailed
studies on the HDE model, see e.g. Refs. [11, 13, 22–
46]. In this work, we use these four typical, simple dark
energy models, namely, the ΛCDM, wCDM, CPL, and
HDE models, as examples to make an analysis for the
real-time cosmology.
The structure of this paper is arranged as follows. In
Sect. II, we present the analysis method and the observational data used in this work. In Sect. III, we report the
constraint results of cosmological parameters and make
some relevant discussions. In Sect. IV, the conclusion of
this work is given.

METHOD AND DATA

We will simulate the redshift drift data of SKA, and use
these mock data to constrain the cosmological models.
We will also simulate the redshift drift data of E-ELT,
and make comparison and combination with the data of
SKA. In order to check how the redshift drift data of
SKA will break the parameter degeneracies generated by
other cosmological observations, we will also consider the
current mainstream observations in this work.

A.

A brief description of the dark energy models

In this subsection, we will briefly describe the dark
energy models employed in the analysis of this work. In
a spatially flat universe with a dark energy having an
EoS w(z), the form of the Hubble expansion rate is given
by the Friedmann equation,
H 2 (z)
= Ωm (1 + z)3 + Ωr (1 + z)4
H02

1 + w(z 0 ) 0

dz ),
1 + z0

E 2 (z) ≡

(1)

where Ωm and Ωr correspond to the present-day fractional densities of matter and radiation, respectively.
Next, we will directly give the expressions of E(z) for the
ΛCDM, wCDM, CPL, and HDE models. Note that since
we mainly focus on the evolution of the late universe, in
the following we shall neglect the radiation component.
• ΛCDM model: Since the cosmological constant Λ
can explain the various cosmological observations
quite well, it has nowadays become the preferred
and simplest candidate for dark energy, although
it has been suffering the severe theoretical puzzles.
The EoS of the cosmological constant is w = −1,
and thus we have
E 2 (z) = Ωm (1 + z)3 + (1 − Ωm ).

(2)

• wCDM model: In this model, the EoS of dark energy is assumed to be a constant, i.e., w = constant,
and thus it is the simplest case for the dynamical
dark energy. For this model, the expression of E(z)
is given by
E 2 (z) = Ωm (1 + z)3 + (1 − Ωm )(1 + z)3(1+w) .

(3)

• CPL model: In this model, the form of the EoS
of dark energy w(a) is parameterized as w(a) =
w0 + wa (1 − a) with two free parameters w0 and
wa . Thus, we have
E 2 (z) = Ωm (1 + z)3 + (1 − Ωm )


3wa z

(4)

• HDE model: In this model, the dark energy density
2 −2
is assumed to be of the form ρde = 3c2 Mpl
Reh [22],
where c is a dimensionless parameter, Mpl is
the reduced Planck mass, and Reh is the future
eventR horizon defined as Reh (t) = armax (t) =
∞
a(t) t dt0 /a(t0 ). The evolution of the universe in
this model is determined by the following two differential equations,

Current mainstream cosmological observations

SN data: We use the largest compilation of type Ia
supernovae (SN) data in this work, which is named the
Pantheon compilation [47]. The Pantheon compilation
consists of 1048 SN data, which is composed of the subset
of 279 SN data from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep
Survey in the redshift range of 0.03 < z < 0.65 and useful
distance estimates of SN from SDSS, SNLS, various lowredshift and HST samples in the redshift range of 0.01 <
z < 2.3. According to the observational point of view,
using a modified version of the Tripp formula [48], in the
SALT2 spectral model [49], the distance modulus can be
expressed as [47]
µ = mB − M + α × x1 − β × c + ∆M + ∆B ,

(7)

where mB , x1 , and c represent the log of the overall
flux normalization, the light-curve shape parameter, and
the color in the light-curve fit of SN, respectively, M
repersents the absolute B-band magnitude with x1 = 0
and c = 0 for a fiducial SN, α and β are the coefficients
of the relation between luminosity and stretch and of the
relation between luminosity and color, respectively, ∆M
is the distance correction from the host-galaxy mass of
the SN, and ∆B is the distance correction from predicted
biases of simulations.
The luminosity distance dL to a supernova can be given
by

CMB data: For the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) anisotropies data, we use the “Planck distance
priors” from the Planck 2015 data [50]. The distance
priors include the shift parameter R, the “acoustic scale”

adopt 3Ωb /4Ωγ = 31500Ωb h2 (Tcmb /2.7K)−4 and Tcmb =
2.7255 K. z∗ can be calculated by the fitting formula [51],
z∗ = 1048[1 + 0.00124(Ωb h2 )−0.738 ][1 + g1 (Ωm h2 )g2 ],

Redshift drift observations from E-ELT and
SKA

The actual measurement for the SL-test signal is the
shift in the spectroscopic velocity (∆v) for a source in
a given time interval (∆to ). The spectroscopic velocity
shift is usually expressed as [2]


∆z
E(z)
∆v =
= H0 ∆to 1 −
,
(23)
1+z
1+z
where E(z) is determined by a specific cosmological
model.
The measurement of velocity shift will be achieved by
the upcoming experiments such as the E-ELT and SKA
through two different means. The E-ELT will be able to
observe the Lyman-α absorption lines of distant quasar
systems to achieve the measurement of ∆v in the redshift
range of z ∈ [2, 5] [2, 55]. The SKA will measure the
spectroscopic velocity shift ∆v by observing the neutral
hydrogen emission signals of galaxies at the precision of
one percent in the redshift range of z ∈ [0, 1]. Obviously,
the E-ELT and SKA experiments will be the ideal complements with each other, because of the explorations of
different periods for the cosmic evolution.
E-ELT mock data: For the E-ELT data, as discussed
in Ref. [6], the standard deviation on ∆v can be estimated
as

(24)
where S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio of the Lyman-α
spectrum, NQSO is the number of observed quasars at
the effective redshift zQSO , and x is 1.7 for 2 ≤ z ≤ 4 and
0.9 for z ≥ 4. In this work, we assume S/N = 3000 and
NQSO = 30. We generate 30 mock data with a uniform
distribution for the E-ELT’s redshift drift observation in
six redshift bins (the redshift interval ∆z = 0.5 for each
bin), and we assume the observation time of ∆to = 10
years.
SKA mock data: For the case of SKA, we follow the
prescription given in Refs. [56, 57] to produce the mock

data of redshift drift. It is shown in Refs. [56, 57] that if
SKA could have the full sensitivity and detect a billion
galaxies, the evolution of the frequency shift in redshift
space would be estimated to a precision of one percent.
Thus, we consider the following two scenarios:
1. For SKA Phase 1, in our simulation, we produce 3
mock data of the drift ∆v in redshift 0 < z < 0.3
with velocity uncertainties σ∆v respectively of 3%
in the first bin, 5% in the second bin and 10% in the
third bin. The redshift interval ∆z is 0.1 for each
bin and the timespan ∆to is 40 years. Note that
although a timespan of 40 years is long integration
time, it can be as a benchmark scenario to improve
sensitivity and redshift coverage in the full SKA
configuration.
2. For SKA Phase 2, we generate 10 mock data of the
drift ∆v in the redshift 0 < z < 1 with the velocity
uncertainty σ∆v /∆v (relative error) ranging from
1% to 10%. Here, we adopt the same treatment
method for the uncertainty as in Ref. [57], i.e., the
relative error σ∆v /∆v is assumed to be linearly increased from 1% to 10% in the redshift range of
z ∈ [0, 1] (from low to high redshifts). To be more
specific, the relative error is assumed to be 1% in
the first bin, 2% in the second bin, and so forth.
This could be reached in the timespan ∆to = 0.5
years, which leads to an extremely competitive and
ideal scenario. Note that the requirement of this
scenario is 107 galaxies observed in each bin [57].
In addition, in the mock data simulation, we adopt the
scheme accordant with our previous papers [7, 11–15, 17].
In other words, the fiducial cosmology for the SL simulated data from E-ELT or SKA is chosen to be the best-fit
cosmology according to the analysis of the data combination of SN+CMB+BAO in ΛCDM model, wCDM model,
CPL model, and HDE model, respectively.
III.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Since the ΛCDM model is widely regarded as a prototype of the standard cosmology, we take this model as
a reference model to test the constraining power of the
SKA-only mock data and make an analysis of constraints
on cosmological parameters when the redshift drift data
of SKA and E-ELT are combined. In Fig. 1, we show
the simulated redshift-drift data for E-ELT, SKA1, and
SKA2, using the ΛCDM model as the fiducial model.
In this figure, the curve of ∆v(z) is plotted according
to Eq. (23), with the fiducial values of parameters given
by the best fit to the SN+CMB+BAO data; the error
bars on ∆v, i.e., σ∆v , for each redshift bin, are plotted
according to Eq. (24) for E-ELT, and according to the
detailed prescriptions described in the above section (the
part entitled “SKA mock data”) for SKA1 and SKA2.
We find that in the E-ELT case the error of ∆v decreases with the increase of redshift, and vice versa in

the SKA1 case or the SKA2 case. In Fig. 2, we plot the
two-dimensional posterior contours at 68% and 95% confidence level (CL) in the ΛCDM model. We clearly see
that using the SKA1-only mock data, the ΛCDM model
can only be loosely constrained, while the model can be
well constrained using the SKA2-only mock data.
In addition, form Fig. 2, we clearly see that in the
ΛCDM model, from the E-ELT, Ωm and h are in strong
anti-correlation while constraints from SKA1 or SKA2
provide a positive correlation for Ωm and h, and thus the
orthogonality of the two degeneracy orientations leads
to a complete breaking for the parameter degeneracy.
Thus, the constraints from the combination of E-ELT
and SKA (SKA1 or SKA2) would have a tremendous improvement, as shown by the gray and red contours in
Fig. 2. Particularly, the result from the combination of
E-ELT+SKA2 is almost as good as the constraint from
the combination of SN+CMB+BAO, which implies that
the redshift drift observation would have chance to be one
of the most competitive cosmological probes. This may
be due to the fact that the experiments of E-ELT and
SKA are complementary in mapping the expansion history of the universe with a model-independent way. That
is to say, these two experiments will be able to directly
perform reconstruction of the expansion history of the
universe in the dark matter- or dark energy-dominated
epochs by using different observational techniques.
In order to understand why Ωm and h are in positive
correlation for SKA and in anti-correlation for E-ELT, we
make a deeper analysis by a comparison of the curves of
derivatives of ∆v with respect to Ωm and h versus z for EELT and SKA. The curves of d∆v/dh and d∆v/dΩm versus z are shown in Fig. 3. We find that d∆v/dΩm always
decreases with increased z, i.e., the varying tendencies of
d∆v/dΩm for E-ELT and SKA are the same though the
values of d∆v/dΩm are not the same. However, d∆v/dh
is increasing in the most part of the SKA’s redshift range
of z ∈ [0, 1] (roughly the range of z . 0.6, covering the
whole range of SKA Phase 1), and it is decreasing in the

E-ELT’s redshift range of z ∈ [2, 5]. Meanwhile, d∆v/dh
is positive in the SKA’s redshift range of z ∈ [0, 1], and
it is negative in the E-ELT’s redshift range of z ∈ [2, 5].
The two experiments are therefore complementary in this
sense, and we can clearly understand why the degeneracies between Ωm and h can be well broken by the two
experiments, as shown in Fig. 2. Notice that in Fig. 3
the blue solid curves of d∆v/dh and d∆v/dΩm are plotted for SKA1. We do not show the case of SKA2, since
the coordinate proportions are too different, which is due
to a small timespan ∆to in the SAK2 simulation.
Meanwhile, we find that the degeneracy orientation of
E-ELT+SKA1 or E-ELT+SKA2 in the parameter plane
is evidently different from result for the combination of
SN+CMB+BAO. This phenomenon would result in an
effective breaking of the parameter degeneracy and a significant improvement of the constraints on dark energy.
It is of extreme interest to know what role the redshift
drift data of SKA will play in constraining dark energy
in the future. Next we will explore this issue in detail.
We constrain the ΛCDM, wCDM, CPL and HDE models by using the data combinations of SN+CMB+BAO,
SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT,
SN+CMB+BAO+EELT+SKA1,
and SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT+SKA2
to complete our analysis. The priors of the free parameters are given in Table II. Here, Ωb h2 and Ωc h2
respectively stand for the physical baryon and cold dark
matter densities. The constraint results are presented
in Tables III–V and Figs. 4–5. In Table III, we show
the best-fit results with the 1σ errors quoted. The
constraint errors and precisions of the cosmological
parameters are given in Tables IV–V, respectively. Here,
for a parameter ξ, we use σ(ξ) to denote its 1σ error.
For the cases that its distribution slightly deviates
from the gaussian distribution, we adopt the value of
averaging the upper-limit and lower-limit errors. We
use ε(ξ) = σ(ξ)/ξbf to denote the relative error of the
parameter ξ, where ξbf is its best-fit value. In this
paper, for convenience, we also informally call ε(ξ)

the “constraint precision” of the parameter ξ. Note
that we do not calculate the constraint precision for
the parameter wa , since its central value is close to 0.
In Figs. 4–5, we show the two-dimensional posterior
distribution contours of constraint results in the ΛCDM,
wCDM, CPL and HDE models at the 68% and 95% CL.
From these figures, we clearly see that when the E-

ELT mock data are combined with SN+CMB+BAO,
the parameter spaces can be significantly reduced in
the ΛCDM, wCDM, and HDE models, while there
is little significant improvement in the parameter
space for the CPL model. Adding the SKA1 mock
data to the data combination of SN+CMB+BAO+EELT, the parameter spaces are sharply reduced. In

FIG. 5: Constraints (1σ and 2σ CL) in the Ωm –w plane for wCDM model, in the Ωm –w0 plane for CPL model, in the
Ωm –wa plane for CPL model, and in the Ωm –c plane for HDE model from the SN+CMB+BAO, SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT,
SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT+SKA1, and SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT+SKA2 data.

particular, when the SKA2 mock data are combined with SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT, the improvement
is actually much more significant than the case of
SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT+SKA1.
Meanwhile, from
Fig. 5, we can easily find that the E-ELT and SKA mock
data can help to break the parameter degeneracies, in
particular between the parameters Ωm and c in the HDE
model.
From Table V, we can easily find that the E-ELT,
SKA1, and SKA2 can significantly improve the constraints on almost all the parameters to different extent,
in particular for SKA2. Concretely, when the E-ELT
mock data are combined with SN+CMB+BAO, the precision of Ωm is improved from 2.29% to 1.55% in the
ΛCDM model, from 2.62% to 1.69% in the wCDM model,
from 2.79% to 1.72% in the CPL model, from 2.68% to
1.65% in the HDE model. The precision of h, w0 , and c
are also enhanced in the ΛCDM, wCDM, CPL, and HDE

models; for details, see Table V. Adding the SKA1 mock
data to the data combination of SN+CMB+BAO+EELT, the improvement of the constraint on parameter Ωm
is from 1.55% to 1.29% in the ΛCDM model, from 1.69%
to 1.28% in the wCDM model, from 1.72% to 1.30% in
the CPL model, and from 1.65% to 1.46% in the HDE
model. For the parameter h, the constraint is improved
from 0.54% to 0.44% in the ΛCDM model, from 0.97%
to 0.76% in the wCDM model, from 1.00% to 0.79% in
the CPL model, and from 0.88% to 0.47%. For the parameters of dark energy, the improvement is from 3.84%
to 3.53% for the parameter w in the wCDM model, from
8.05% to 7.85% for the parameter w0 in the CPL model,
and from 5.30% to 2.41% for the parameter c in the HDE
model.
Furthermore, when the SKA2 mock data are combined
with SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT, the improvement of the
constraint on parameter Ωm is from 1.55% to 0.42% in

from 1.00% to 0.47% in the CPL model, and from 0.88%

see that for the CPL model the error of wa is reduced
by 0.74% once the SKA2 data are considered. Therefore, we conclude that the redshift drift data of SKA will
help to significantly improve the constraints of parameters and break the degeneracy between the parameters in

IV.

CONCLUSION

In this work, we wish to investigate what extent the
cosmological parameters can be constrained to when the
redshift drift data of SKA are used and what will happen when the combination of SKA and E-ELT mock
data is considered. We use the five data sets, i.e.,
SKA1, SKA2, E-ELT, E-ELT+SKA1, E-ELT+SKA2,
and SN+CMB+BAO to reach our aims in the ΛCDM
model. We find that using the SKA2 mock data alone,
the ΛCDM model can be constrained well, while the constraint is weak from the mock data of SKA1-only. When
the redshift drift mock data of SKA and E-ELT are combined, the results show that the parameter space is dramatically reduced almost as good as SN+CMB+BAO.
Thus, the last aim of this work is to investigate what
role the redshift drift data of SKA will play in constraining dark energy in the future. To fulfill the task, we
employ several concrete dark energy models, including
the ΛCDM, wCDM, CPL, and HDE models, which are
still consistent with the current observations at least to
some extent.
We first use the data combination of SN+CMB+BAO
to constrain the four dark energy models, and then we
consider the addition of the E-ELT mock data in the
data combination, i.e., we use the data combination of
SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT to constrain the models. The
constraints on cosmological parameters are tremendously
improved for the ΛCDM, wCDM, and HDE models,

[1] A. Sandage, Astrophys. J. 136, 319 (1962).

while E-ELT mock data do not help improve constraints
in the CPL model. When adding the SKA1 mock data to
the SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT, the constraint results are
significantly improved in all the four dark energy models. For example, with the help of the SKA1 mock data,
the constraints on Ωm are improved by 10%–25%, and
the constraints on h are improved by 15%–50%. Furthermore, when the SKA2 mock data are combined with
the dataset of SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT, the constraint
results are tremendously improved in all the four dark
energy models. Concretely, the constraints on Ωm are
improved by 25%–70%, and the constraints on h are
improved by 50%–70%. We also find that the degeneracy between cosmological parameters could be effectively
broken by the combination of the E-ELT and SKA mock
data. Therefore, we can conclude that in the future the
redshift-drift observation of SKA would help to improve
the constraints in constraining dark energy and have a
good potential to be one of the most competitive cosmological probes in constraining dark energy.
