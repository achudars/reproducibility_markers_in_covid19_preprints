Abstract
This paper develops a unified, accurate and computationally efficient method for changepoint inference in non-stationary spatio-temporal processes. By modeling a non-stationary
spatio-temporal process as a piecewise stationary spatio-temporal process, we consider simultaneous estimation of the number and locations of change-points, and model parameters in each
segment. A composite likelihood-based criterion is developed for change-point and parameters
estimation. Asymptotic theories including consistency and distribution of the estimators are derived under mild conditions. In contrast to classical results in fixed dimensional time series that
the asymptotic error of change-point estimator is Op (1), exact recovery of true change-points is
guaranteed in the spatio-temporal setting. More surprisingly, the consistency of change-point
estimation can be achieved without any penalty term in the criterion function. A computational
efficient pruned dynamic programming algorithm is developed for the challenging criterion optimization problem. Simulation studies and an application to U.S. precipitation data are provided
to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Keywords: Dynamic programming; increasing domain asymptotics; multiple change-points; pairwise likelihood; structural breaks.

Introduction

In analyzing dependent data, many widely-used statistical models in practice require the assumption
of stationarity to establish the validity of statistical methodologies. However, stationary models
are often inadequate when the data are collected over a long period. A growing body of empirical
evidence reveals that real data do exhibit non-stationarities, such as in climate statistics (Kelly and
Ó Gráda, 2014; Nam et al., 2015), financial data (Fryzlewicz, 2014) and genetics (Fearnhead and
Liu, 2007; Fearnhead and Rigaill, 2018). Instead of developing complicated models for describing the
non-stationary behavior, it is often more intuitive and effective to incorporate a change-point model
which segments the data into stationary pieces. With the advance in data collection technology,
many long or high frequency data sets are available, and hence change-point analysis is becoming
increasingly popular in recent decades.
Change-point estimation has been extensively studied for time series data, see, for example,
Davis et al. (2006); Aue et al. (2009); Matteson and James (2014); Preuss et al. (2015); Cho and
Fryzlewicz (2015); Yau and Zhao (2016). Recently, change-point analysis has gained popularity in
high-dimensional statistics (Wang and Samworth, 2018) and functional data analysis (Berkes et al.,
2009; Aston and Kirch, 2012; Aue et al., 2018). However, inference of change-points for spatiotemporal data remains largely unexplored. Only a few literature have considered change-point
estimation for spatio-temporal processes. Moreover, the existing methods are subject to various
limitations. For example, Bayesian methods such as Majumdar et al. (2005) and Altieri et al.
(2015) usually require very specific model structures and are computationally intensive. Gromenko
et al. (2017) focus on at most one change-point in the mean function of a spatio-temporal process.
Furthermore, all existing literature require the separability of space-time covariance. The major
difficulty of change-point analysis for spatio-temporal processes stems from the theoretical and
computational challenges of spatio-temporal modeling under the increase in dimension of both
space and time with the presence of unknown change-points.
In this paper, we propose a likelihood-based procedure for multiple change-point estimation in
spatio-temporal process with spatial locations at a possibly irregular grid. The procedure adopts
pairwise likelihood to alleviate the computational difficulty of the full likelihood for spatio-temporal
data while maintaining statistical efficiency. The proposed method is a general approach that can
handle a wide range of spatio-temporal models including both separable and non-separable spacetime covariance. Furthermore, it works under model misspecification and can detect changes beyond
first and second moments.
The contribution of this paper is two-folded. First, in terms of statistical theory, we show that,
in contrast to the commonly used likelihood-based change-point estimation approach for time series

2

(e.g. Davis et al., 2006; Ma and Yau, 2016), the pairwise likelihood for spatio-temporal data induces
an edge effect from the boundary of each change-point. This edge effect is non-ignorable under the
spatio-temporal setting as the spatial dimension grows, and causes inconsistency of change-point
estimation. To tackle this problem, we carefully modify the pairwise likelihood by introducing a
marginal likelihood term to correct the edge effect. Interestingly, unlike traditional criterion functions such as Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and minimum description length (MDL) which
involve a penalty term, the consistency of the change-point estimation can be achieved solely by
the modified pairwise likelihood. Moreover, in contrast to classical results in fixed dimensional time
series that the asymptotic error of change-point estimation is Op (1), we show that exact recovery of
true change-points is guaranteed in the spatio-temporal setting under mild conditions. To further
achieve consistent model selection for each segment and enhance finite sample performance, an
MDL-based criterion function is developed. We prove that, even if the model is misspecified, the
number and locations of change-points can be consistently estimated under mild assumptions. The
asymptotic distributions of the estimated change-points and the spatio-temporal model parameters
in each stationary segment are also derived.
Second, in terms of statistical computing, we develop a computationally efficient algorithm
for the optimization of the criterion function. Computational feasibility is a major challenge in
change-point estimation since it involves optimization over a large number of change-point location
configurations. Popular optimization methods, such as binary segmentation (Zhang et al., 2010)
and genetic algorithm (Davis et al., 2006), are fast but only provide approximate solutions. On the
other hand, dynamic programming algorithms (Killick et al., 2012; Maidstone et al., 2017) provide
exact solutions with a linear to quadratic computational cost. In particular, the pruned exact
linear time (PELT) algorithm (Killick et al., 2012) reduces the computational cost substantially
by pruning away irrelevant computational configurations. In this paper, PELT is adapted to the
spatio-temporal setting to yield a computationally efficient and asymptotically exact solution to
the optimization problem.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background and derivation
of the composite likelihood based criterion for change-point inference. The main results including
estimation consistency and asymptotic distribution of the estimators are presented in Section 3.
Numerical experiments and an application to U.S. precipitation data are given in Section 4.

Background

2.1

Setting and notations

On a set of spatial locations S with cardinality S = Card(S), consider a spatio-temporal process
Y = {yt,s : t ∈ [1, T ] ∩ N, s ∈ S} = {yt : 1 ≤ t ≤ T, t ∈ N} ,
where yt = {yt,s : s ∈ S} denotes the observations of all locations at time t. There are in total S · T
observations. We focus on S ⊂ R2 , while the theory can be easily generalized to Rd with d ≥ 3.
We assume that the spatio-temporal process can be partitioned into m + 1 strictly stationary
segments along the time dimension 1 . In other words, there are m unknown distinct change-points
τ1 , . . . , τm in the observations. Set τ0 = 0, τm+1 = T , and let λj = τj /T, j = 0, . . . , m + 1 be the
normalized change-points. Assume that 0 = λ0 < · · · < λm < λm+1 = 1. The asymptotic results
are based on increasing S, T with the λj s being fixed.
For j = 1, . . . , m + 1, the jth stationary segment is modeled by a stationary process Xj =
(j)
{xt }t∈N

(j)

with xt

(j)

= {xt,s : s ∈ S}, such that
(j)

xt−τj−1 = yt ,

t = τj−1 + 1, . . . , τj .

(1)

Let Tj = τj − τj−1 be the length of the jth segment. The observed spatio-temporal process Y can
be written as

(2)

(m+1)

Y = (x1 , . . . , xT1 , x1 , . . . , xT2 , . . . , x1

(m+1)

, . . . , xTm+1 ) .

As in Davis et al. (2008) and Aue et al. (2009), we first assume for simplicity that the data
across different segments Xj (j = 1, . . . , m + 1) are independent. This assumption is commonly
found in spatio-temporal change-point literatures, such as Altieri et al. (2015). Also, Gromenko
et al. (2017) assume independence between functional observations, which implies the independence
between segments. See Remark 1 for discussions on its relaxations.
Given the locations of the change-points, each stationary segment is modeled by a member of a
pre-specified finite class of models, M. Each element in M is a model specified by an integer-valued
parameter ξ of dimension c that represents the model order. Let ξj be the cj -dimensional integervalued vector that specifies the model order for the jth segment Xj . Note that, by definition, the
form of the parametric model and thus the form of the likelihood function for the jth segment Xj
is completely determined by ξj . Given ξj , the model for Xj depends on a real-valued parameter
θj = θ(ξj ) of dimension dj = dj (ξj ). That is, the distribution of Xj is completely determined by
θj . Here, ξj is regarded as a parameter for the model order and θj is the parameter that specifies

Note that potentially there can also be structural breaks across the space S, however, since there is no natural
order for S, the search space is much larger, so here we do not consider this case.

the exact model. This framework, for example, covers the general spatio-temporal process
Yt,s = µt,s + εt,s ,

(2)

where t = 1, . . . , T , s ∈ S and εt,s is a zero-mean error process. The mean µt,s of Yt,s can take a
0 β, where z
constant µ or a regression form such as zt,s
t,s denotes a p-dimensional covariates associated

with (t, s). The covariance structure φt,s = Cov(Yt1 ,s1 , Yt1 +t,s1 +s ) can take K possible parametric
forms of separable or non-separable spatio-temporal dependence. Here, a model class may be
specified by ξ = (i1 , . . . , ip , k), where iq = 1 or 0 indicates whether the qth covariate is selected in
the model or not, and k ∈ {1, . . . , K} indicates the parametric form for the covariance structure.
Also, θ(ξ) contains the coefficients of the selected covariates and the covariance parameters.
Define ψj = (ξj , θj ) as the complete model parameter set of the jth segment. Assume that θj
is in the interior of a compact parameter space Θj ≡ Θj (ξj ) ⊂ Rdj . The change-points and the
model parameter vector are denoted by Λ = {λ1 , . . . , λm } and Ψ = {ψ1 , . . . , ψm+1 }, respectively.
(j)

To lighten the notations, we use xt,s for xt,s and suppress the j in Tj and Θj when there is no
possibility of confusion.

2.2

Composite likelihood and pairwise likelihood

Although likelihood based methods generally achieve high statistical efficiency, when the likelihood
function involves high-dimensional inverse covariance matrices or integrals, computations become
infeasible. To overcome this limitation, Lindsay (1988) considers the composite likelihood, which is
a weighted product of likelihoods for some subsets of the data. By specifying the subsets, different
classes of composite likelihood are obtained. One popular class is the pairwise likelihood, which is
the product of the bivariate densities of all possible pairs of observations,
Y
LP (θ; X) =
Li (θ; xi , xj )wi,j ,

(3)

i,j

where wi,j are the weights. Composite likelihood often enjoys computational efficiency while statistical efficiency is retained; see Lindsay (1988); Varin et al. (2011). Owing to its flexibility and
attractive asymptotic properties, composite likelihood has been widely used in genetics (Larribe
and Fearnhead, 2011), longitudinal data (Bartolucci and Lupparelli, 2016), time series (Davis and
Yau, 2011), spatial statistics (Guan et al., 2015) and spatio-temporal statistics (Bevilacqua et al.,
2012; Huser and Davison, 2014).
Given a stationary segment X = {x1 , . . . , xT } with parameter ψ, the pairwise likelihood is
defined as the product of the bivariate densities f (·, ·; ψ) of each distinct pair of observations.
However, in many spatio-temporal processes, the dependence between observations diminishes as
the time lag or spatial distance increases, so there is a loss of efficiency because most of the pairs

5

are not informative. Therefore, it suffices to consider pairs up to a small time lag k and a small
spatial distance d. Denote N ≡ N (s) = {s0 |s0 ∈ S, s0 6= s, dist(s, s0 ) ≤ d} as a distance-based
neighborhood of location s, where the distance can be Euclidean metric. Note that N depends on
d implicitly. Given observations X and (k, N ), the pairwise log-likelihood is defined as
X
X
lpair (ψ; xt,s1 , xt+i,s2 ) ,
log f (xt,s1 , xt+i,s2 ; ψ) =
PLST (ψ; X) =

(4)

(t,i,s1 ,s2 )∈Dk,N

(t,i,s1 ,s2 )∈Dk,N

where Dk,N = {(t, i, s1 , s2 ) : 1 ≤ t, t + i ≤ T, 0 ≤ i ≤ k, s1 ∈ S, s2 ∈ s1 ∪ N (s1 ), if i = 0, s1 6= s2 } is
the collection of pairs of observations that are at most k time units and d spatial distance apart.
For the choices of k and N , intuitively, larger neighborhood can be used if there exists strong
spatial correlation across S, and smaller neighborhood should be favored if the spatial correlation
is weak; see Varin and Vidoni (2005) and Bai et al. (2012). On the other hand, similar to Ma and
Yau (2016), if the main focus is estimating change-points rather than model parameters, then it
usually suffices to use the smallest k and d that ensure identifiability of the models in the candidate
model set M. See more discussions below Assumption 3 in Section 3.

2.3

Edge effect and a remedial composite likelihood

By the definition of Dk,N in (4), each data point in a stationary segment does not appear in PLST
for the same number of times. For example, x1 can only be paired with {xt : t = 1, . . . , k + 1}, and
thus appears approximately half frequently than an ordinary observation xt̃ , k + 1 ≤ t̃ ≤ T − k,
which can be paired with {xt : t̃ − k ≤ t ≤ t̃ + k}. This can be viewed as that different weights
are implicitly assigned to the observations in X = {x1 , . . . , xT }, and observations on the edge of a
segment receive less weights. We call this phenomenon in pairwise likelihood the “edge effect”.
When we want to decide whether a change point τ exists in a segment, say {xt : t1 ≤ t < t2 }, we
need to compare two quantities: the pairwise likelihood formed by {xt : t1 ≤ t < t2 }, and the sum
of pairwise likelihoods formed by {xt : t1 ≤ t < τ } and {xt : τ + 1 ≤ t < t2 }, respectively. For the
latter quantity, all observations within k time units from τ suffer from the edge effect and receive
less weights. Essentially, the latter quantity has O(S) fewer terms than the former one. When
S −→ ∞, the edge effect is non-ignorable and can cause inconsistency of the pairwise likelihood
based method, as the following example shows.
Example 1. Consider the simple example of k = 1 and let the criterion function be in the form
IC(m) = −

m+1
X

PLST (ψ̂j ; Xj ) + C(m + 1) log(ST ) ,

j=1

where m is the number of change-points, PLST (ψ̂j ; Xj ) is the pairwise log-likelihood of the jth
segment evaluated under a parameter estimate ψ̂j , and the penalty C(m + 1) log(ST ) is of similar
6

magnitude as some common information criteria such as BIC. We compare between two scenarios:
• Scenario 1: No change point is assumed and the pairwise log-likelihood function gives an
estimate ψ̂ over the entire observations Y . We have IC(0) = −PLST (ψ̂; Y ) + C log(ST ), where
X
log f (yt,s1 , yt+i,s2 ; ψ̂) ,
PLST (ψ̂; Y ) =

Dk,N = {(t, i, s1 , s2 ) : 1 ≤ t, t + i ≤ T ; 0 ≤ i ≤ 1; 1 ≤ s1 ≤ S; s2 ∈ s1 ∪ N (s1 ); if i = 0, s1 6= s2 }.
• Scenario 2: A change point is fixed at

T
2

and the pairwise log-likelihoods give the estimates
P
ψ̂1 , ψ̂2 in the two segments, respectively. Thus, IC(1) = − 2j=1 PLST (ψ̂j ; Xj ) + 2C log(ST ), where

Suppose that there is no change-point in the data, i.e., Scenario 1 is true, and the true parameter
value is ψo . Then, under some regularity conditions, the estimators ψ̂, ψ̂1 and ψ̂2 converge in

probability to ψo with order ST . Hence, by Taylor’s expansion, it can be seen that

If |Σ| > 1, then the term in (6) is strictly positive and is of order Op (S), which dominates the penalty
term of order O(log ST ). Combining with (5), IC(0) − IC(1) > 0 with probability approaching
one, indicating that a change-point model is wrongly selected.



The non-ignorable edge effect in Example 1 is due to the special feature of S −→ ∞ in the spatio7

temporal setting, in contrast to the fixed cross-sectional dimension in multivariate time series. To
fix the edge effect and hence achieve consistency, one should compensate the missing pairs in the
edge so that each data point appears the same number of times in the likelihood function. This can
be achieved by introducing additional marginal likelihoods for data points observed on the edge
t = (1, . . . , k) ∪ (Tj − k + 1, . . . , Tj ), resulting in a new composite likelihood (for the jth segment)

on (S, Tj ), which is suppressed for notational simplicity.

Derivation of the criterion

With the modified composite likelihood, in this section we derive a criterion function for estimating
the change-points and model parameters in each segment. The criterion is based on the minimum
description length (MDL) principle, which aims to select the best-fitting model that requires the
minimum amount of code length to store the data (Rissanen, 2012), and has been shown to have
promising performance for change-point detection; see Davis et al. (2006, 2008); Aue and Lee
(2011). One classical way to construct the MDL is the two-stage approach (Hansen and Yu, 2001;
Lee, 2001), which splits the code length, CL(Y ), into two components:
c + CL(Y | M)
c ,
CL(Y ) = CL(M)
c is the code length for the fitted model M
c and CL(Y | M)
c is the information
where CL(M)

likelihood estimator of θj is obtained by θ̂j = arg maxθj ∈Θj LST {(ξj , θj ); Xj }, where LST is defined

Since (λ1 , . . . , λm ) contains information equivalent to the integer-valued vector (T1 , . . . , Tm+1 ), and

To ensure identifiability of the change-points, assume that there exists an λ > 0 such that

Main Results

In this section, we impose some mild regularity conditions on the composite log-likelihood, and
on the strong-mixing coefficients of the piecewise stationary spatio-temporal process, and then we
present the main results.
For the asymptotic theory, we assume that the spatio-temporal process is generated by a random
field in D = N × S ⊂ N × R2 . Also, the data Y is observed on Dn = Tn × Sn with Tn = [1, Tn ] ∩ N
and |Sn | = Sn , in other words,
Y = {yt,s : t ∈ [1, Tn ] ∩ N, s ∈ Sn , Sn ⊂ R2 }.
The asymptotic theory is based on n −→ ∞, where the number of observations |Dn | = Sn Tn >
|Dn0 | = Sn0 Tn0 whenever n > n0 . For notational simplicity, in the following we use (S, T ) instead of
(Sn , Tn ) when there is no possibility of confusion.
We define a metric ρ on D by ρ(d1 , d2 ) = max(|t2 − t1 |, |s12 − s11 |, |s22 − s21 |), where di = (ti , si ),
si = (s1i , s2i ), i = 1, 2, are indexes in D. Also, the distance between any subsets U, V ∈ D is defined
as
ρ(U, V ) = inf{ρ(d1 , d2 ) : d1 ∈ U and d2 ∈ V } .
The asymptotic results follow an increasing domain framework as in Jenish and Prucha (2009)
and Bai et al. (2012), as is made explicit by Assumption 1.
Assumption 1. The (possibly unevenly spaced) lattice D ⊂ N × R2 is countably infinite. All
elements in D are located at distances of at least ρ0 > 0 from each other, i.e., for all d1 , d2 ∈ D,
we have ρ(d1 , d2 ) ≥ ρ0 .
Assumption 1 allows for unevenly spaced locations and general forms of sample regions, which
is often encountered in real data. By Assumption 1, we can assume the maximum cardinality of
the neighborhood set N (s) is bounded by a constant BN . Throughout this section, we assume the

Similar as above, if the data Y is observed on a regular lattice, then by the piecewise stationarity
assumption, the supremum w.r.t. (S, T ) can be dropped in Assumption 3. Assumption 3 does not
require that the stationary process is from the model class M. Instead, Assumption 3(i) only
assumes the existence of a pseudo-true model ψjo in M, which is of the simplest form. That is,
the model cannot be expressed by another model ψj∗ = (ξj∗ , θj∗ ) in M, where θj∗ is of a smaller
dimension. The last statement in Assumption 3(i) asserts that for any model order ξj∗ , the point
θj∗ is the unique parameter value that maximizes the expected composite likelihood.
Assumption 3(ii) rules out the degenerate case that the (j − 1)th and jth stationary segments
are indistinguishable by the composite likelihood. In general, Assumption 3(ii) may fail if the two
adjacent segments follow different models but have the same expected composite likelihood. In
theory, this situation can always be avoided by using a larger lag k and neighborhood N when
defining (7). As noted by Ma and Yau (2016), this situation seldom occurs in practice and k = 1
or 2 is usually sufficient to distinguish between stationary segments.
The next two assumptions regulate the dependence structure of the spatio-temporal process
by imposing strong mixing conditions on the underlying random field. For U, V ⊂ D, let σ(U ) =
σ(xt,s ; (t, s) ∈ U ) be the sigma field generated by the random variables in U. Define
α(U, V ) = sup{|P (A ∩ B) − P (A)P (B)|; A ∈ σ(U ), B ∈ σ(V )} .
11

The α-mixing coefficient for the jth stationary random field Xj is defined as
αXj (m; u, v) = sup{α(U, V ); |U | ≤ u, |V | ≤ v, ρ(U, V ) ≥ m} .
Also, denote M = (1 + k)(1 + BN ), where 2M upper bounds the number of composite likelihood
(j)

components lpair that any point (t, s) can have in Dk,N .
Assumption 4 (r). For each stationary segment Xj of the random field, where j = 1, . . . , mo + 1,
there exist some  > 0 and c ∈ 2N where c > r, such that for all u, v ∈ N+ , u + v ≤ c, u, v ≥ 2, we
have
∞

(m + 1)3(c−u+1)−1 [αXj (m; M u, M v)]/(c+) < ∞ .

Assumption 4 requires a polynomial decaying rate for the mixing coefficient of the random field,
which is mild and is used for invoking the moment inequality in Doukhan (1994) that controls the
asymptotic size of the composite likelihood. Note that the mixing rate in Assumption 4 depends
on M = (1 + k)(1 + BN ). This is intuitive since a longer time lag k and a larger neighborhood size
BN induce a slightly higher dependence among the composite likelihood and thus require stronger
conditions on the mixing coefficients. Define also

which characterizes the dependence of the random field along the time dimension. It can be regarded
as an analogue to the classic strong mixing coefficient in the time series setting.
Assumption 5. For each stationary segment Xj of the random field, where j = 1, . . . , mo + 1,
there exist r > 2, δ > 0 and τ > r(r + δ)/(2δ), such that for any fixed model order ξ,

Assumption 5(i) is a moment condition on the first order derivative of the composite likelihood,
which is similar to the one in Assumption 2. Assumption 5(ii) is a mild mixing condition along the
time dimension and is used for invoking an maximal moment inequality in Yang (2007) that controls
the asymptotic size of the first order derivative of the composite likelihood at the true parameter
value. Note that for a fixed moment condition c = r + δ, the slowest polynomial decaying rate for
the mixing condition is τ >

which is achieved when r → 2. Thus, a higher order moment

condition on the first order derivative requires a weaker mixing condition.
Next, we impose Assumptions 6 and 7, which are standard in establishing the asymptotic

Consistency of CLMDL

We now present the main results of this paper. We begin with a somewhat surprising results on the
consistency of change-point estimation using the composite likelihood function alone without any
penalty for model complexity. It requires the existence of the (2 + )th moments of the composite
likelihood in (7) and its derivatives, and a mild divergence rate requirement between T and S.
Proposition 1. Let Y be a piecewise stationary spatio-temporal process specified by the vector
(mo , Λo , Ψo ), and Assumptions 1, 2(r), 3 and 4(r) hold with some r > 2. Analogous to (12), define

and ξ˜j has a dimension greater than dj for j = 1, . . . , mo + 1, in probability.

(14)

The consistency of change-point estimation in Proposition 1 can be viewed as the opposite
phenomenon to the inconsistency result in Example 1. The intuition behind is as follows. By
assigning one false change-point to a stationary segment, the difference introduced on the composite
likelihood criterion function in (13) is the difference between the dropped pairwise likelihood and
the corresponding compensated marginal likelihood. For a stationary segment, by Assumption
3 and information inequality, the expected value of the dropped pairwise likelihood minus the
compensated marginal likelihood is positive and is of order O(S). That is, a model with an overestimated change-point has a significantly larger criterion function value than the true model, and
thus will not be selected. This phenomenon is due to the use of the proposed composite likelihood
and that S −→ ∞ (which is non-ignorable). In contrast, the classical time series setting lacks this
feature and the consistency needs to be achieved by an extra penalty term in the criterion function
to suppress over-estimation.
Proposition 1 only guarantees consistency in change-point estimation but not model selection. Indeed, introducing penalty term ensures consistency of model selection in each segment
and improves the finite sample performance in terms of reducing false positive when there is no
change-point. Theorem 1 states the consistency of our procedure based on the CLMDL criterion.
Theorem 1. Let Y be a piecewise stationary spatio-temporal process specified by the vector (mo , Λo , Ψo ),
and Assumptions 1, 2(r), 3 and 4(r) hold with some r > 2. Then, for the estimator (m̂, Λ̂ST , Ψ̂ST )
defined in (12), we have that for j = 1, . . . , mo , there exists a λ̂ij ∈ Λ̂ST , 1 ≤ ij ≤ m̂, such that


P [T λoj ] − [T λ̂ij ] = 0 −→ 1 ,
provided that S, T −→ ∞. If, in addition, T · S −r/2 −→ 0 and Assumption 5 holds, then we have
m̂ −→ mo ,

[T Λ̂ST ] = [T Λo ],

Ψ̂ST −→ Ψo ,

(15)

in probability.
In Proposition 1 and Theorem 1, we have P ([T Λ̂ST ] = [T Λo ]) −→ 1, which indicates that
asymptotically we can recover the exact position of the change point without error. This result is
different from the one under the multivariate time series setting, where an Op (1) error is observed
asymptotically. This difference is due to the expansion of S under the spatio-temporal setting,
which intuitively provides more information for the detection of change points.
To guarantee the consistency of the estimated number of change points, Proposition 1 and
Theorem 1 require an additional polynomial rate condition on the divergence rate between S and
T , i.e. T · S −r/2 −→ 0. This technical condition is needed for controlling the asymptotic size
of the edge effect via a union bound. Compared to the classical multivariate time series setting,
e.g. Ma and Yau (2016), the condition here is more complicated due to the expansion of S. Note
14

that a higher moment assumption r on the composite likelihood function implies a less restrictive
divergence rate requirement. In the case where Y is Gaussian, all moments of the composite
likelihood exist, and the rate requirement becomes minimal.
Indeed, if the spatio-temporal process Y is observed on a regular lattice, then under an additional
assumption on the mixing coefficients, a finer result in terms of the divergence rate between S and
T can be obtained.
Theorem 2. Let Y be a piecewise stationary random field specified by the vector (mo , Λo , Ψo ), and
Assumptions 1, 2(r), 3, 4(r) and 5 hold with r > 2. Moreover, assume that
αXj (n) := sup sup αXj (n; u, v) ≤ Cn−θ ,

(16)

u≥1 v≥1

for some C > 0, θ > 2(1 + η)(q + δ)/(q − 2 + δ) with some q > 2, δ > 0 and 0 < η < 1/2. Then,
for the estimator (m̂, Λ̂ST , Ψ̂ST ) defined in (12), we have
m̂ −→ mo ,

[T Λ̂ST ] = [T Λo ],

Ψ̂ST −→ Ψo ,

(17)

in probability provided that S, T −→ ∞ with log T /S −→ 0.
The strong mixing coefficient αXj (m) in (16) is widely used in the literature, see Berkes and
∗ (m). Thus, if the random field is strongly
Morrow (1981). By definition, we have that αXj (m) ≥ αX
j

mixing with αXj (m) decaying at a sufficiently fast polynomial rate, then Assumptions 4, 5, 6, and
(16) hold. By Section 2.1 of Doukhan (1994), a wide range of stationary Gaussian random fields
have a polynomially decaying mixing coefficient αXj (m), provided that their covariance functions
decay at a sufficiently fast polynomial rate.
Remark 1. The consistency results given in Proposition 1, Theorems 1 and 2 are based on the
independence assumption across segments, which we denote as IS. Based on IS, the likelihood
P
(j)
function in the proposed CLMDL takes the form m+1
j=1 LST (ψj ; Xj ) as a sum of likelihoods across
the independent segments, which we denote as IL. As we show later, similar to the classical time
series setting, CLMDL still gives consistency result under relaxation of IS when there is weak
dependence across segments. On the other hand, relaxing IL is more difficult and requires specific
model assumption about the dependence across segments, which is hard to define, especially for nonseparable spatio-temporal covariance. As IL already enjoys consistency and relaxing IL may only
have marginal improvement in efficiency but risks losing robustness, relaxing IL is not suggested.
Before stating the consistency result under relaxation of IS, we quantify the relaxation with
Assumption 8, which is a spatio-temporal extension of Assumption 3.1 in Aue et al. (2009).

t > 1. Note that the initial observations of segment j depends on the last observations of segment

j − 1. Simple algebra yields Zt,s = (α(j) )t−T λj−1 (YT λj−1 − YT λj−1 ) for T λj−1 + 1 ≤ t ≤ T λj , which
clearly satisfies the absolutely summable condition.
The consistency result of CLMDL under the relaxed IS is presented in Corollary 1.
Corollary 1. Let Assumption 8 hold for the observed process Y , and Y ∗ is a piecewise stationary
spatio-temporal process specified by the vector (mo , Λo , Ψo ) and satisfies conditions in Theorem 1
or Theorem 2, we have that
[T Λ̂ST ] − [T Λo ] = Op (1),

and m̂ −→ mo ,

Ψ̂ST −→ Ψo ,

in probability provided that S, T −→ ∞ and S = O(T ), with T · S −r/2 −→ 0 (Theorem 1) or with
log T /S −→ 0 (Theorem 2).
By Corollary 1, the exact recovery property of the change-point estimator T Λ̂ST in Theorems
1 and 2 no longer holds. However, the relative change-point estimation remains consistent, i.e,
Λ̂ST − Λo = Op (T −1 ), which is common in classical time series setting. Intuitively, the presence of
Zt,s induces an extra Op (S) term which blurs the observed Yt,s process around the true change-point
T Λo . Note that Corollary 1 additionally requires S = O(T ) to limit the impact of the extra Op (S)
term, indicating the difficulty of detecting change-points with relaxation of IS.

3.2

Asymptotic distribution

We now investigate the asymptotic distribution of the change-point estimator. We focus on the
case where IS holds for Y since derivation of the asymptotic distribution under relaxation of IS is
difficult unless specific parametric assumption is made. See Remark 2 below for more discussion.
16

Theorems 1 and 2 indicate that under IS, the integer-valued change-points can be recovered
exactly. Thus, there is no non-degenerate asymptotic distribution for the estimated change-points
Λ̂ST . Nevertheless, the following Theorem 3 gives some insights on the finite-sample behavior of
Λ̂ST . For simplicity, we only present the result for k = 1, the result for k ≥ 1 is similar but
notationally more complicated. Define E1 = {(s1 , s2 ) : s1 ∈ S, s2 ∈ s1 ∪ N (s1 )} and E2 = {s ∈ S :
repeat s by 1 + |N (s)| times}.

inaccurate. The intuitive reason is that the distribution of T (λ̂j − λoj ) converges too fast towards
its degenerate limit when more information from the spatial dimension is available.

also on the true distributions of the jth and (j + 1)th segments. Hence, this simulation procedure
is valid only if the true models of the jth and (j + 1)th segments are known. In other words, if the

Numerical Experiments

We begin this section by discussing the numerical optimization algorithm for solving the minimization in (12), and then present simulation studies and applications to real data.

4.1

Optimization Using PELT

The optimization problem in (12) involves huge amount of combinatorial search for the best changepoints configuration and thus is computationally intensive. Various searching algorithms have been

18

proposed in the literature for this optimization problem. In general, the searching algorithms
can be classified as stochastic or deterministic. Stochastic methods such as genetic algorithm
(Davis et al., 2006) require large scale simulation and give simulation-dependent solutions. Among
the deterministic methods, the optimal partitioning (Jackson et al., 2005), which uses dynamic
programming to simplify the exhaustive search on all possible choices, can still be computationally
intensive for large datasets. Recently, pruning-based dynamic programming algorithms (Killick
et al., 2012; Maidstone et al., 2017) are proposed to obtain exact optimization solution by discarding
some unnecessary change-point configurations in dynamic programming.
In particular, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm proposed by Killick et al. (2012)
is a modified dynamic programming algorithm that solves the minimization problem of the form
F (T ) =

m+1
X

C(Y[(τj−1 +1):τj ] ) + βf (m),

(21)

j=1

where Y[a:b] = {yt ; t = a, . . . , b}, m is the number of change-points, C is the cost function for a
segment and βf (m) is a penalty function for the number of changes. If f (m) = m + 1, PELT
solves (21) by recursively computing

F (s) = min F (t) + C(Y[(t+1):s] ) + β ,
t

where t < s < T . The minimization is taken over all t < T excluding those satisfying the pruning
condition
F (t) + C(Y[(t+1):t0 ] ) + K ≥ F (t0 ) ,

(22)

for some t0 > t with t0 − t ≥ T λ .2 The constant K depends on C and is required to satisfy
C(Y[(t+1):s] ) + C(Y[(s+1):T ] ) + K ≤ C(Y[(t+1):T ] ) , for all t < s < T .

(23)

In practice, a considerable number of time points can be pruned by (22) and hence the efficiency
of the dynamic programming algorithm can be greatly improved.
To implement PELT in the current spatio-temporal setting, we express the CLMDL in (10) in
the format of (21) as
C(Y[(τj−1 +1):τj ] ) = Ck,N

where β = Ck,N and f (m) = log m. Although f (m) is not equal to m + 1, the minimization of
(10) can still be performed by applying PELT iteratively with an adaptive choice of the penalty
function f (m), until convergence; see Section 3.2 of Killick et al. (2012) for more detail.

Note that the additional requirement t0 − t ≥ T λ is imposed by the identification condition in (11).

Compared to the classical multivariate time series setting which PELT is designed for, under the
spatio-temporal setting, the constant K in (23) is much harder to derive due to the non-ignorable
edge effect when spatial dimension S −→ ∞. If the condition (23) for K is not satisfied for all
t < s < T , the exact minimizer of CLMDL cannot be guaranteed to be found by PELT. The
following lemma provides a potential choice of K, which can guarantee the asymptotic validity of
applying PELT for the minimization of CLMDL.

The true change points T Λo will not be pruned asymptotically as S, T −→ ∞ under the conditions
of Theorem 1 and T 2 · S −r/2 −→ 0, or the conditions of Theorem 2 and T · S −r/2 −→ 0.
Since the true change-points T Λo are not pruned asymptotically, by Theorem 1 or 2, PELT
can find the minimizer of CLMDL as S, T −→ ∞. Although there is no guarantee that PELT can
obtain the exact solution of CLMDL when S and T are small, in practice, we find PELT works
well as demonstrated by the numerical experiments in Section 4.2. Note that for small S and T , an
alternative is to directly implement optimal partitioning (Jackson et al. (2005)), which guarantees
the exact minimization of CLMDL and requires a computational cost of O(ST 2 ).

Simulation studies

For all the simulation studies, we set k = 1 and d = 2 in defining the composite likelihood, λ = 0.1
in the optimization, and set the number of replications to be 1000. Throughout the numerical
experiments, we mainly consider a four-parameter autoregressive spatial model,
yt − µ = φ(yt−1 − µ) + εt ,

(24)

where yt = {yt,s : s ∈ S} is defined on a regular two-dimensional grid S = {(s1 , s2 ) : s1 , s2 =
1, . . . , s}, i.e. S = s2 , and εt = {εt,s : s ∈ S} is a Gaussian noise with exponential covariance
function Cov(εt,u , εt,v ) = σ 2 exp{− ku − vk22 /ρ} and Cov(εt,u , εt0 ,v ) = 0, when t 6= t0 . The model
is specified by θ = (µ, φ, ρ, σ 2 )T , where φ ∈ (−1, 1), ρ > 0 and σ 2 > 0. Spatial and temporal
dependence are determined by ρ and φ respectively. Meanwhile, µ and σ 2 control the overall mean
and variance.
Simulation 1. (Change-point detection rate at different sample sizes and signal levels)

20

In this simulation, we demonstrate the estimation accuracy of CLMDL under different sample
sizes and signal levels. We assume that the underlying process in each stationary segment follows
(24) with µ = 0 known, hence the process is specified by θ = (φ, ρ, σ 2 )T .
Let θ1 = (−0.5, 0.6, 1)T and θ2 = (−0.5+δφ , 0.6+δρ , 1)T be the underlying parameter vectors for
the segments before and after the change-point, respectively. When there is no change-point (i.e.
δφ = δρ = 0), the entire process is simulated from θ1 , otherwise there is a change-point at λo1 = 0.5.
We consider four scenarios corresponding to no change-point, change in temporal dependence (δφ ),
change in spatial dependence (δρ ) and change in both spatial and temporal dependence.
Table 1 reports the estimated number of change-points under various settings. Under the nochange scenario, there is no false positive even when the sample size is small. Some over-fitting
is observed for small sample when there is change in spatial dependence, which is probably due
to the larger variation in estimating ρ. The over-fitting rate decreases when sample size increases.
The detection power improves when either S, T or signal level (δφ , δρ ) increases. For example, for
(δφ = 0.2, S = 62 , T = 100), the detection power increases from 37% to 81% or 98% respectively,
when S increases to 102 or T increases to 200. To be expected, the proposed procedure is most
powerful when there is change in both δφ and δρ .
Simulation 2. (Distribution of change-point estimator)
This simulation compares the empirical distribution of the change-point estimator and its
asymptotic distribution stated in Theorem 3. The underlying process follows (24) with µ = 0 known
and θ1 = (−0.5, 0.6, 1)T and θ2 = (−0.3, 0.6, 1)T . In this simulation, S = 82 , 102 and T1 = T2 = 100
are considered, each with 1000 replicates. When the number of change-points is correctly estimated,
100 replicates of WST (·) are simulated using ψ̂1 and ψ̂2 to compute arg maxq∈Z WST (q; ψ̂1 , ψ̂2 ).
The top panel of Figure 1 gives the QQ plots of the empirical quantile of λ̂ against its theoretical
quantile based on arg maxq∈Z WST (q; ψ̂1 , ψ̂2 ) in Theorem 3. Note that the plot closely aligns with
the 45 degree line. The bottom panel of Figure 1 depicts the histograms of λ̂. The distribution
of λ̂ is non-standard and becomes degenerate as the sample size increases, which aligns with the
asymptotic results.
Table 2 further reports the performance of 90% confidence interval (CI) obtained from the theoretical quantiles of arg maxq∈Z WST (q; ψ̂1 , ψ̂2 ). The width of CI decreases as sample size increases,
and the empirical coverage probabilities are close to the nominal level.
Simulation 3. (Consistency without any penalty term)
This simulation demonstrates the consistency of change-point estimation by the composite
likelihood when there is no penalty term, as stated in Proposition 1. The underlying process
follows (24) with µ = 0 known. Let θ1 = (−0.5, 0.6, 1)T and θ2 = (−0.5 + δφ , 0.6, 1)T be the

underlying parameter vectors for the segments before and after the change-point, respectively.
When there is no change-point (i.e. δφ = 0), the entire process is simulated from θ1 and T = 100,
otherwise there is a change-point at λ1 = 0.5. Table 3 reports the estimated number of changepoints using the proposed CLMDL and the composite likelihood (CL). Since there is no penalty
term, we observe some over-fitting by CL when S = 302 and δφ = 0.2. On the other hand, CLMDL
does not have false positive due to the penalty term. As the sample size increases, both criteria
shows consistency, which agrees with the theoretical result. This example shows the penalty term
in CLMDL can improve the estimation accuracy in finite sample and CL without penalty terms is
consistent asymptotically.

Simulation 4. (Robustness under misspecification)
In this simulation, we demonstrate the robustness of CLMDL against model misspecification.
In particular, we consider the non-separable spatio-temporal covariance function in Cressie and
Huang (1999),

where h and u are respectively the space and time distance, d = 2 is the spatial dimension, ν > 0
is the smoothness parameter which characterizes the behavior of the correlation function near the
origin, Kν is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order ν, a ≥ 0 is the scaling
parameter of time, b ≥ 0 is the scaling parameter of space, c > 0 is the space-time interaction
parameter, and σ 2 = C(0, 0|θ) > 0 is the variance at the origin. The parameter vector θ =
(a, b, c, ν, σ 2 ) completely specifies the covariance function in (25).
Note that C(h, u|θ) in (25) generalizes various popular covariance functions. For example, if
24

u = 0, then C(h, 0|θ) becomes the Matérn spatial covariance function. When ν = 0.5, it is further
reduced to an exponential covariance function. When ν −→ ∞, the Gaussian covariance function
is obtained. Moreover, a separable spatio-temporal covariance function is obtained when c = 1.
See Cressie and Huang (1999) for details.
In this simulation experiment, a model with change-point (δ > 0) consists of two segments with
parameters θ1 = (1, 1, 3, 0.2, 1)T and θ2 = (1 + δ, 1 + δ, 3, 0.2, 1)T respectively, and T1 = T2 = 50. A
model without change-point consists of one segment with parameter θ1 and T = 100. We consider
S = 62 , 72 , 82 and δ = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.15, 2.0.
We conduct the change-point estimation using both the separable model (24) and the true
model (25) to illustrate the robustness of CLMDL under misspecification. Table 4 summarizes the
numerical result. It shows that CLMDL works well under model misspecification, with a low false
positive rate when there is no change-point and high detection power when change-point exists.
Compared to the true model, the loss in power due to model misspecification is small. It further
shows that the empirical means of the change-point estimators based on both the misspecified model
and the true model converge to the true value with the empirical standard deviations decrease
gradually as sample size increases.
Simulation 5. (Model selection and multiple change-point detection)
In this example, we study the performance of CLMDL for model selection with the presence
of multiple change-points and model misspecification. Specifically, we simulate a spatio-temporal
process with four stationary segments. The underlying process for the first, second and fourth
segments follow the four-parameter autoregressive spatial model (24) with θ1 = (0.0, −0.2, 0.6, 1.0)T ,
θ2 = (0.0, −0.5, 0.6, 1.0)T , θ4 = (0.3, −0.2., 0.9, 1.0)T and T1 = T2 = T4 = 50. For the third segment,
instead of exponential covariance function, Matérn spatial covariance function is used, i.e.

where Kν (·) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind and Cov(εt,u , εt0 ,v ) = 0, when t 6= t0 .
We set φ = −0.5, σ 2 = 0.9, µ = 0.3 in (24) with ν = 2 and ρ = 0.9 for the Matérn spatial covariance
function and T3 = 50.
The three change-points correspond to change in φ, change in µ and spatial covariance function,
and change in φ and spatial covariance function respectively.
The candidate model class M consists of two models, M1 and M2 , both in the form of (24)
with exponential spatial covariance function, while M1 with µ = 0 fixed and M2 with µ as a free
parameter. The number of parameters of M1 and M2 are 3 and 4 respectively. Note that M1 is
nested within M2 by setting µ = 0. For the third segment, the true model is not included in M.
Since M2 allows non-zero µ, it acts as the pseudo-true model. In summary, the (pseudo-) true

Table 5 reports the results of the multiple change-point estimation. It can be seen that the
proportion of correctly estimated number of change-point increases, and both over-fitting and
under-fitting diminish as S increases. Moreover, the empirical standard deviations of the estimated
location of change-point decrease gradually. Table 6 reports the model selection results, which
further shows CLMDL performs well for model selection and maintains its efficiency when the
model is misspecified.

Application to U.S. precipitation data

Change-point detection in the amount of precipitation has been recognized as an important problem
in climatology and environmental science (Gallagher et al., 2012; Gromenko et al., 2017). Gallagher
et al. (2012) provides a review on some common approaches. Existing methods such as Gallagher
et al. (2012) and Gromenko et al. (2017) only consider the at-most one change-point case, and
require space-time separability of the covariance function, thus are not directly comparable with
the proposed CLMDL.
We consider data from the Global historical climatological network database (GHCN), which
is a main database for global climate monitoring. In particular, some key climate variables such as

the amount of precipitation are collected from stations located all over the world. The documentation and datasets are available from Menne et al. (2012) and GHCN official website3 . Similar
to Gromenko et al. (2017), selected precipitation data from the Midwest region of U.S., including
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio,
South Dakota and Wisconsin are considered.
In the GHCN database, daily precipitation from each station is recorded. However, there are a
lot of missing data in many stations. Therefore, we focus on the land surface stations that provide
at least 5 daily records of in each month over the entire period, and compute the monthly average
∗ }
precipitation data for the analysis. In summary, we have the monthly average precipitation {yt,s

in tenths of a millimeter (mm) from January 1941 to December 2010 for 76 stations (i.e. S = 76
and T = 720). To alleviate the heavy tail behavior of the data, we transform the monthly average

We select all pairs with time lag within 2 month (k = 2) and spatial distance within 200
kilometers in the specification of composite likelihood. The geodesic distance (Karney, 2013) is
used as the spatial distance, which corresponds to the shortest path between two points on the
WGS84 ellipsoid. To handle the yearly seasonality, we apply an analysis-of-variance model to
remove the month effects, treating each month as class variable as in Auchincloss et al. (2008) and
Bai et al. (2012). The change-point detection is then conducted by CLMDL with the non-separable
spatio-temporal covariance function (25) of Cressie and Huang (1999) on the resulting residuals.

The CLMDL detects two change-points at August 1952 and September 1971. Similar estimation
results are observed under different choices of time lag and spatial distance for the neighborhood,
indicating the robustness of the result. The first change-point is within the great drought and
prolonged heatwave which had great impact on the Midwest region of U.S. (Mishra and Singh,
2010; Westcott, 2011). The second change-point is inline with the change in climate in North
America proposed by Bartomeus et al. (2011) and Westcott (2011). Moreover, the second changepoint is close to the detected change-point (1968) by Gromenko et al. (2017), which analyzes a
similar dataset but allows at most one change-point. Based on Theorem 3, the 90% CIs for the
change-point are (November 1951, March 1953) and (April 1971, February 1972) respectively.
