ABSTRACT
We present a detailed analysis of a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed ultra-massive quiescent galaxies (log(M∗ /M ) ∼ 11.5) at z & 2. This sample comprises 15 galaxies selected in the
COSMOS and UDS fields by their bright K-band magnitudes and followed up with VLT/X-shooter
spectroscopy and HST /WFC3 HF 160W imaging. These observations allow us to unambiguously confirm their redshifts ascertain their quiescent nature and stellar ages, and to reliably assess their internal
kinematics and effective radii. We find that these galaxies are compact, consistent with the high mass
end of the mass-size relation for quiescent galaxies at z = 2. Moreover, the distribution of the measured
stellar velocity dispersions of the sample is consistent with the most massive local early-type galaxies
from the MASSIVE Survey showing that evolution in these galaxies, is dominated by changes in size.
The HST images reveal, as surprisingly high, that 40 % of the sample have tidal features suggestive
of mergers and companions in close proximity, including three galaxies experiencing ongoing major
mergers. The absence of velocity dispersion evolution from z = 2 to 0, coupled with a doubling of
the stellar mass, with a factor of four size increase and the observed disturbed stellar morphologies
support dry minor mergers as the primary drivers of the evolution of the massive quiescent galaxies
over the last 10 billion years.

1. INTRODUCTION

Local galaxies follow a bimodal distribution in color
represented by blue star-forming spirals and red dormant elliptical galaxies. The most massive galaxies, primarily located in cluster environments, are the giant Elliptical galaxies with stellar population ages suggesting
a formation more than 10 billion years ago (Ma et al.
2014; Greene et al. 2015).
A population of red massive galaxies are discovered to
exist at z ∼ 2 (Franx et al. 2003; Daddi et al. 2004) and
subsequently confirmed to have quiescent stellar population (Cimatti et al. 2004; Daddi et al. 2005; Labbé et al.
2005; Kriek et al. 2006a; Toft et al. 2007; Williams et al.
2009). At this epoch the star formation rate density
peaked (Madau & Dickinson 2014) alongside substantial
nuclear activity (AGN) (Hopkins et al. 2007). At this
time, half of the most massive (log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11)
galaxies are already devoid of star formation (SF), and
have old stellar ages suggesting that they quenched their
star formation at even earlier times (z > 3), when the
Universe are only a few Gyr old (e.g. van Dokkum et al.
2006; Kriek et al. 2006b; Franx et al. 2008; van Dokkum
et al. 2008; Toft et al. 2009; McCracken et al. 2010;
Williams et al. 2010; Wuyts et al. 2011; Brammer et al.
2011; Whitaker et al. 2011; Kado-Fong et al. 2017; Morishita et al. 2018). Nowadays quiescent galaxies are popularly defined by the UVJ color-color relations (see e.g.
Muzzin et al. 2013a).
These massive quiescent galaxies are found to be remarkably compact with extremely high stellar densities
when compared to local galaxies with similar stellar
mass (Papovich et al. 2005; Trujillo et al. 2006, 2007;
Buitrago et al. 2008; van Dokkum et al. 2008; Cimatti
et al. 2008; Bezanson et al. 2009; Conselice et al. 2011;
Szomoru et al. 2012; van der Wel et al. 2014; Mowla
et al. 2018). A small number of elliptical galaxies this
compact are found in the local Universe (Trujillo et al.
2009; Taylor et al. 2010b; Shih & Stockton 2011; FerréMateu et al. 2012), but these are too young (ages ∼ 2−4
Gyr) to be the descendants of z = 2 compact quiescent
galaxies. This suggests that the vast majority of the
z = 2 population must undergo a substantial increase
in size to evolve into local elliptical galaxies (Bell et al.
2012).
Bluck et al. (2012) found that the expected size evolution between z = 2.5 and present day can be described
primarily by minor mergers. However Newman et al.
(2012); Man et al. (2016a) found that minor mergers can

account for the evolution at z < 1 and that additional
mechanisms of growth is required at higher redshift.
The minor merger scenario is supported by the continuous size evolution found in compilation of spectroscopic
(Damjanov et al. 2011; Belli et al. 2014b; Matharu et al.
2019) and photometric (van der Wel et al. 2014; Faisst
et al. 2017; Mowla et al. 2018) studies as well as the
expected theoretical predictions of the galaxy properties during merger evolution (e.g. Khochfar & Silk 2006;
Naab et al. 2009; Lagos et al. 2018).
To study the dynamics of massive quiescent galaxies at z > 2, it is important to obtain both reliable
kinematic and morphological measurements using deep
spectroscopic observations and high resolution (adaptive optics or space-based) imaging (Kriek et al. 2009;
Toft et al. 2012; van de Sande et al. 2013; Belli et al.
2017). Quiescent galaxies beyond z > 2 are more disklike with higher ellipticities than local ellipticals (Toft
et al. 2005, 2007; van der Wel et al. 2011; Wuyts et al.
2011), which may cause heightened dispersion measurements from the contribution of unresolved rotation. In
Toft et al. (2017) and Newman et al. (2018), the first
spatially resolved gravitationally lensed z > 2 massive
quiesecent galaxy are observed.
Massive quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 2 are rare (ArcilaOsejo et al. 2019) and their quiescent nature implies
faint rest-frame UV continua with no strong emission
lines. Due to their rarity, large survey fields are essential to locate these galaxies. So far only a small samples
of massive quiescent galaxies have been spectroscopically confirmed at z > 2, in existing surveys like CANDELS+GOODS, and few of those have robust velocity
dispersion measurements (van de Sande et al. 2013; Belli
et al. 2014b; Kriek et al. 2016; Belli et al. 2017; Morishita
et al. 2018).
In this paper, the structural and dynamical properties of 15 UVJ massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs),
log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11, at z > 2 are studied, doubling
the spectroscopically confirmed and absorption-line detected sample at this epoch using the 2 sq. deg. COSMOS and UDS field. These MQGs are examined in
detail through their evolution to local galaxies and how
they likely formed in minor and major merger processes.
In a follow-up paper, the Fundamental Plane relation
and its evolution to z = 0 is studied (Djorgovski &
Davis 1987; Dressler et al. 1987).

(2012) K-band, stellar mass, zphot and rest-frame colors estimated from the observed photometry with EAZY (Brammer et al.

log(M∗ /M ) > 10 (Muzzin et al. 2013a). The spectroscopically confirmed z > 2 MQGs from COSMOS are shown with black

In Section 2, we present the sample selection of the
z = 2 galaxies and a corresponding local reference sample. The X-shooter spectroscopic and HST imaging
data reduction, alongside the photometry used throughout the paper, are presented in Section 3. In Section 4
we present the methods used to extract the X-shooter
absorption-line kinematics, stellar populations and the
HST structural properties from the data, together with
a multi-wavelength comparison of different star formation tracers. We address the issue of progenitor bias
using our local reference sample in Section 5.1. We
present the stellar population, kinematic and structural
results in Section 5.2 and 5.3, and the dynamical properties in Section 5.4. The results and the evolution of
these galaxies to z = 0 are discussed and summarised in
Section 6 and 7, respectively.
Throughout the manuscript, magnitudes are quoted
in the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983; Fukugita et al.
1996), and the following cosmological parameters are
used: Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc.
All stellar masses are presented using the Chabrier
(2003) Initial Mass Function (IMF).
2. SAMPLE SELECTION

The sample studied here consists of 15 MQGs from
the COSMOS and UDS (Williams et al. 2009) fields
for spectroscopic follow-up and is selected based on
the modeling of their optical to far-infrared broadband
SEDs. Three samples, from three periods of observation,
are presented below. In the first program, galaxies were

identified to be at zphot > 1.6 and with old (> 1Gyr),
quiescent stellar populations (specific star formation
rates log(sSFR/yr) < −11) in the updated version of
the Ilbert et al. (2009) catalog of the COSMOS field described in Man et al. (2012). The four K band brightest
(K < 21.5) sources covered by parallel HST /NICMOS
observations were selected for follow-up to enable study
of their morphology. These galaxies are referred to as
the P86 sample, named after the period of VLT/Xshooter observations (P86, 2010-2011).
In a second program, 10 of the K band brightest
(K < 20.5) galaxies in the COSMOS field with photometric redshifts1 zphot > 1.9, specific starformation rates log(sSFR/yr) < −10, and stellar masses
log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11 from the Muzzin et al. (2013a)
catalog were selected for follow-up. Based on visual
inspection, the sources with nearby bright objects in
the K band images are excluded to avoid photometric contamination. Objects with Spitzer /MIPS 24 µm
detections are also excluded to avoid either dusty starforming galaxies or AGN (Le Floc’h et al. 2009). Their
SEDs were visually inspected and galaxies with noisy
photometry or bad fits were excluded. This pool of
galaxies are dubbed the P93 sample, observed 3 years
after P86.

d Previously published in Toft et al. (2012) (all values in table taken from there)

Finally, in the analysis presented here, the massive quiescent galaxy UDS19627, from Toft et al.
(2012), is included. This object are selected as part
of early VLT/X-shooter GTO observations to be quiescent (log(sSFR/yr) < −10), at a high redshift
(zphot = 2.02+0.07
−0.08 ) and a bright source (K = 20.19) in
the UKIRT Ultra Deep Survey (Williams et al. 2009).
New HST /WFC3 HF 160W imaging of this galaxy is
presented, allowing us to measure resolved morphology.
UDS19627 is minimally gravitationally lensed, but Toft
et al. (2012) showed that, after taking this effect into
account, the systematic change in magnification factor
of 10 − 20 % correspond to a 0.07 and 0.03 dex resulting
lower stellar and dynamical mass.
Our full sample is compiled from the three presented
subgroups selected with variations in criteria on stellar mass, sSFR, and K-band brightness. In Figure 1a,
we show that despite the variation in selection criteria, this sample populates the quiescent galaxy region of
the UVJ rest-frame color-color diagram (Muzzin et al.
2013b). For the sake of homogeneity the full sample

(except for UDS19627) is shown using the Muzzin et al.
(2013a) catalog. Our galaxies are consistent with the
UVJ selection for massive (log(M∗ /M ) > 10) quenched
objects at 1.9 < z < 2.5.
Figure 1b shows the position of our sample in the Kband magnitude - stellar mass plane. The K < 20.5 and
log(M∗ /M ) > 11 selection of the P93 sample results in
significantly larger stellar masses than the average for
the P86 sample (selected as massive quiescent galaxies
with NICMOS coverage) with only 1 galaxy from the
latter fully satisfying the criteria of P93 (previously presented in, among others, van de Sande et al. 2013; Kriek
et al. 2016; Belli et al. 2018). The power of adding a
minimum K-band threshold to the stellar mass criterion to select the most extreme massive quiescent galaxies is evident when comparing our sample with previous studies (van de Sande et al. 2013; Krogager et al.
2014; Belli et al. 2017), identifying on average massive
quiescent galaxies with lower stellar masses. Our sample represents 60% of the total number of UVJ -MQGs
(29% of all galaxies) at 1.9 < z < 2.5, log(M∗ /M ) > 11
and K < 20.5 from Muzzin et al. (2013a) (upper right

Ultra Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z & 2
corner of Figure 1b). We confirm that our selection of
UVJ quiescent galaxies can be considered representative of the massive and K-band brightest galaxies at
1.9 < z < 2.5. This is done by using a modified version of the Anderson-Darling test2 to compare our stellar
mass and K-band selection with the photometric samples respectively.
One concern addressed by van de Sande et al. (2014) is
that the selection of the K-band brightest galaxies introduces a bias towards the bluest galaxies in the rest-frame
color (g − z)rf . To address this issue the rest-frame colors (g−z)rf , as a function of redshift between our sample
and the UVJ selected massive (log(M∗ /M ) > 11) quiescent galaxies from Muzzin et al. (2013a), are compared
in Figure 1c. Contrary to the sample of van de Sande
et al. (2014), 13/15 of our galaxies has (g − z)rf colors
consistent within the standard deviation of the average
massive quiescent galaxies at a matching epoch. The
Anderson-Darling test for k-samples confirms that the
(g − z)rf colors for our MQGs are representative of the
(log(M∗ /M ) > 11) UVJ massive quiescent galaxies at
1.9 < z < 2.5. This suggests that, our K-band selected
sample is on average not biased towards galaxies with
bluer colors. However, the highest redshift sources have
systematic lower (g − z)rf colors and could be subjected
to this selection bias.
In summary, our sample is selected to be the most
massive K-band bright UVJ quiescent galaxies at z > 2.
The selection is not subjected to a bias in (g − z)rf
and can be considered a 60 % stellar mass and K-band
complete sample of the quiescent galaxies at z > 2.
2.1. A suitable reference sample of local galaxies
The MASSIVE Survey samples the most massive Kband selected early-type galaxies within the local 108
Mpc northern hemisphere (Ma et al. 2014). These
galaxies have central stellar ages suggesting a formation
epoch at z > 2 (Greene et al. 2015). Given the similar
selection for our MQGs at z > 2, stellar masses and
inferred formation epoch, this sample is adopted as the
local reference sample. This sample is further motivated
in Section 5.1.
The extinction-corrected absolute K-band magnitudes listed in Table 3 from Ma et al. (2014) are converted into stellar masses using Equation (1) in van de
Sande et al. (2019). The NASA-Sloan Atlas semi-major
axis optical effective radii, also listed in Table 3 from
Ma et al. (2014), are used. These were derived from

two-dimensional Sérsic (Sérsic 1968) fits with Sérsic parameters varying between n = 2 − 6. For the galaxies
where this is not available, the infrared 2MASS measurements were used to convert these to semi-major axis
optical effective radii using Equation (4) in Ma et al.
(2014). These sizes were derived from single Sérsic and
de Vaucouleurs profile fits (n = 4). The effective velocity dispersion measurements used are reported in Veale
et al. (2018). They were estimated using the MILES
stellar library (Falcón-Barroso et al. 2011) together
with pPXF (Cappellari & Emsellem 2004). Finally, the
average luminosity-weighted stellar velocity dispersion
within the effective radius is adopted.
3. DATA

Here, we describe the spectroscopic observations with
the VLT/X-shooter spectrograph (D’Odorico et al. 2006;
Vernet et al. 2011) and the HST /WFC3 follow-up of
our MQGs. These spectroscopic and photometric campaigns spanned an interval of more than 10 years, spread
over several programs that are summarized in Table 1.
Finally, the ancillary data used in the analysis are presented.

3.1. VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy
X-shooter is a single object Echelle spectrograph
mounted on the VLT and covers 3, 000 − 25, 000 Å with
three arms: UVB (2936 − 5930 Å), VIS (5, 253 − 10, 489
Å), and NIR (9, 827 − 24, 807 Å). We are granted 35 and
57 service mode hours in P86 and P93, respectively (PI:
Toft). The latter carried over and finished in period 96.
The observations are completed using default nodding
mode to ensure a robust sky subtraction of the NIR
band, probing the rest-frame optical part of the spectra
for the z ∼ 2 quiescent galaxies. The majority of the
P86/P93 observations (89/96%) are completed with an
average air-mass corrected DIMM seeing of 0.00 8 in the
NIR arm. The telluric standard stars are observed close
to the science observations, both in airmass and time
to mimic the conditions of the sky and optimize the
atmospheric absorption correction. The P86/P93 observations for the NIR (VIS) frames are executed with
480s/900s (314s/863s) exposures, 0.9” × 11” slit configuration and – for the P93 sample only – including the
K-band blocking filter. We aligned the slit along the
galaxy’s major axis in the UltraVISTA K-band images
avoiding bright nearby sources.
The data are reduced using a wrapper of the ESO Xshooter pipeline (Modigliani et al. 2010; Sparre 2015),
along with customized modifications (Zabl et al. 2015).

Stockmann et al

Beyond the standard pipeline processing steps for the
NIR arm in nodding mode, we account for the spatial
variations of the background level outside of the orders
in each raw science frame by removing the median level
obtained from the illuminated areas from each row of
pixels in the detector. The 2-D VIS and NIR individual science frames are corrected for telluric absorption with a customized and publicly available wrapper3
(Selsing et al. 2016) of the Penalized Pixel-Fitting algorithm (Cappellari & Emsellem 2004, pPXF), based on
the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere library (Husser et al.
2013). A response function is constructed modeling the
atmosphere during the science exposures and each individual observation block (OB) are corrected.
Finally, individual OBs are combined into an optimally weighted 2-D spectrum removing flux outliers
using a 3 and 5σ median clipping for the VIS and
NIR, respectively. Bad pixels automatically flagged
during the reduction are also excluded. Furthermore,
off-trace emission is flagged and excluded in the construction of the OBs from UV-105842, UV-171687,
and UV-155853 to minimize the contamination from
surrounding sources. The 1-D spectrum is optimally
extracted (Horne 1986). Flux corrections are made
anchoring the synthetic photometry to the total magnitudes from the latest COSMOS15 catalog (Laigle et al.
2016) (Section 3.3), accounting for PSF matching in
different bands and for the Galactic extinction. The
H-band and I-band magnitudes are used to compute
independent aperture correction factors for the NIR and
VIS spectra, respectively.

3.2. HST/WFC3 HF 160W imaging
11 orbits of HST /WFC3 with HST-GO-14721 (PI:
Conselice) are allocated to observe the rest-frame optical images, HF 160W , for UDS19627 and the 10 galaxies
in the P93 sample. The P86 sample are covered by
the following programs: CP-1243752 (HST-GO-12440,
PI: Faber) and CP-561356 (HST-HLA-14114, PI: van
Dokkum) with WFC3; CP-1291751 and CP-540713 with
HST/NICMOS (HST-HLA-9999, PI: Scoville).
The WFC3/HF 160W data is reduced using the “Grism
redshift and line” analysis software, Grizli4 , which is
an end-to-end processing code for WFC3/IR data us3 https://github.com/jselsing/QuasarComposite/blob/master/
py/telluric.py
4 https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli/

ing ASTRODRIZZLE5 . The starting point is the standard calibrated images downloaded from the MAST
archive (FLT extension images). The calibrated images are 1014 × 1014 pixels with 000 .13/pixel. For each
visit, there are four dithered exposures that are combined using Grizli. The resulting products for each visit
are aligned, background subtracted and drizzled images
with 000 .06/pixel. The NICMOS data for CP-1291751
and CP-540713 are reduced in a similar manner with
ASTRODRIZZLE.

3.3. Ancillary data: Multi-wavelength photometry and
HST IF 814W images
We make ample use of the 14 broadband COSMOS
photometry from the Laigle et al. (2016) catalog, covering the full UV-to-NIR wavelength range to model our
stellar populations in Section 4.3. The total magnitudes
are adopted using the method described in Appendix
A.2 by the same authors. Complementary to the UVto-NIR photometry, we check the available deep X-ray
Chandra imaging (Marchesi et al. 2016) and the “superdeblended” far-infrared (FIR) catalog (Jin et al. 2018),
superseding the previous 24 µm catalog (Le Floc’h et al.
2009) used in the selection of P93. This new implementation adopts active priors from the Spitzer /MIPS 24
µm and radio observations to deblend the low resolution
imaging from Herschel /PACS and SPIRE, SCUBA2,
AzTEC, and MAMBO. The sources are cross-check with
the GALEX far-UV and near-UV data from Zamojski
et al. (2007) and Capak et al. (2007). This search for
UV or X-ray counterparts results in no detections for
any of our galaxies. On the other hand, we do find hints
of mid-infrared (MIR) and radio emission from part of
the sample, as detailed in Section 4.4.2 and discussed
in Section 6.4. UDS19627 has similar UV-to-NIR multiwavelength coverage. For an in-depth discussion of the
available photometric data for this object, see Toft et al.
(2012).
13/15 galaxies have HST IF 814W imaging that are
part of the COSMOS public released data (Scoville et al.
2007; Koekemoer et al. 2007). It covers ∼ 2 sq degrees of
the sky with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in
the I-band and comprises 81 tiles. Each tile is observed
in 4 dithered exposures that are combined to produce
a pixel scale of 0.00 03/pixel and a Point Spread Function
(PSF) of 0.00 095 at full width at half maximum (FWHM).
COSMOS images reach a point source limiting depth of
AB(F 814W ) = 27.2 (5σ).

4. ANALYSIS

We present in this section the analysis of our Xshooter spectra and our HST /WFC3 HF 160W images.
The spectroscopic redshift, the velocity dispersion and
stellar population of our galaxies are measured by modeling the absorption features in the stellar continuum
together with the broadband photometry. As we find
no significant emission line detections in the spectra, we
derive optical SFR upper limits (Section 4.4) which we
compare with the estimates from the MIR photometry.
The majority of the spatially offset sources caught in
the spectra are foreground and background galaxies.
Finally, the HST images probing the rest-frame optical structure are modeled to obtain their morphological
parameters. The major merger candidates (UV-108899,
UV-250513, and CP-561356 - see Figure 2) are confirmed to be within redshift proximity such that their
stellar masses reliably can be flux corrected.
The HST Red-Blue (RB) color images, rest-frame optical X-shooter spectra with (Laigle et al. 2016) photometry and our best fitting stellar population model
is shown in Figure 2. For UDS19627, the HST/WFC3
HF 160W image is presented in Section 4.5 and its spectrum is shown in Toft et al. (2012).
4.1. Spectroscopic redshifts and stellar velocity
dispersion
All spectra of targeted sources (P86 and P93 ) show
prominent hydrogen absorption features, which are typical of evolved stellar populations (see Figure 2). The
stellar absorption features are modeled using pPXF, and
both the line of sight velocity centroid (i.e., the spectroscopic redshift) and the line of sight stellar velocity
dispersion (LOSVD, hereafter “velocity dispersion”) are
measured.
The initial redshift and velocity dispersion guess is obtained from running pPXF with the (Bruzual & Charlot
2003) stellar population library (hereafter BC03). The
stellar population analysis is performed with complex
star formation histories (SFHs) fitting of the spectra
and SED (see Section 4.3) adopting this initial estimate.
The resulting best fit model is confirmed to be stable
against perturbations of ∆σ = ±100 km/s. The velocity
dispersion measurement is refined, by rerunning pPXF
with a non-velocity broadened best-fit stellar population
model.
The spectra and best-fit model are convolved to the
same resolution (F W HM = 3.2 Å) and rebinned to a
constant velocity scale without additional interpolation.
Low order additive (a=2) and multiplicative (m=2) correction polynomials are fit over the rest-frame range

Figure 3. Comparison of spectroscopic and photometric
redshifts for our sample of massive quiescent galaxies using
the Muzzin et al. (2013a) (red) and Laigle et al. (2016) (blue)
catalogs. The Muzzin et al. (2013a) catalog provides better
photometric redshift estimates for massive quiescent galaxies at z > 2 compared to Laigle et al. (2016). Note that
UDS19627 is not in the same area of the sky covered by the
catalogs compare here.

3750 − 5950 Å. The JH band gap and the regions, where
emission lines might be expected6 , are excluded while
also masking out bad pixels.
The associated systematic and statistical errors are
quantified by varying the wavelength range, correction
polynomials, and stellar libraries (see details in Appendix B), similar to the method used in Toft et al.
(2017). In all cases (P86 and P93 ), we determine secure redshifts and for 10/14 galaxies we estimate robust
velocity dispersions. The spectroscopic redshifts and velocity dispersion measurements along with the combined
systematic and statistical errors (Appendix B) are listed
in Table 2 and 3, respectively. In Table 3, we also list
the velocity dispersion for UDS19627 derived in Toft
et al. (2012). In Figure 3, the derived spectroscopic redshift are compared with the photometric estimates from
Muzzin et al. (2013a) and Laigle et al. (2016). Using
the Normalised Median Absolute Deviation (σN M AD )
from Brammer et al. (2008), no catastrophic outliers are

Stockmann et al

found except for photometric redshifts being systematically below the spectroscopic redshifts for both catalogs,
finding a better agreement for Muzzin et al. (2013a).

4.2. Emission lines
No on-source nebular line emission is detected at 3σ
for any objects in the sample. For UV-108899 and UV239220 we find indications of emission (∼ 2σ) from
[OII]3726.2, 3728.9 and Hα6563, respectively. In Appendix C, we discuss the specifics of the fitting method
and list, in Table 2, the SFR and uncertainties from the
[OII] and Hα (Kennicutt 1998). Furthermore, spatially
offset line emission is observed in four (UV-155853, UV171687, UV-171060, UV-105842) 2-D spectra coinciding
with close proximity sources. In 3/4 cases, this emission
arises from foreground or background sources (Appendix
A.2). The latter source north-east of UV-105842 shows
significant [OII]3726.2, 3728.9 Å, [OIII]4959, 5007Å, and
Hα emission with a matching redshift of z = 2.0124.
This corresponds to a velocity offset of 2130 ± 120 km/s
from UV-105842. If purely due to galaxy motion, such
an offset suggests that the two sources are not gravitationally bound at the time of observation. Another explanation of the asymmetric morphology might be a high
redshift analog of the locally observed offset AGN (Comerford & Greene 2014), likely caused by recent merger
event.

4.3. Stellar population modeling of continuum emission
In order to put constraints on the physical parameters of the stellar populations, the VIS+NIR X-shooter
spectra and the broadband photometry are fit with the
Bayesian approach, from Gallazzi et al. (2005) (recently
revised in Zibetti et al. (2017)), using the derived spectroscopic redshift. Spectral regions of poor atmospheric
transitions are not included in the calculation. Before
fitting, the models are convolved by the initial velocity
dispersion estimated in Section 4.1.
Models are obtained by convolving the latest revision
of BC03 Simple Stellar Population (SSP) models using the MILES stellar libraries (Sánchez-Blázquez et al.
2006; Falcón-Barroso et al. 2011) with a large Monte
Carlo library of star formation histories, metal enrichment histories and dust attenuations. The prior distribution of models is the one described in Zibetti et al.
(2017), but here limited to 50,000 models with formation ages younger than 5 Gyr to be consistent with the
high redshift of our galaxies. A full description of the
model library is given in Zibetti et al. (2017), however
the most relevant information are summarized here.

SFHs are modeled with a continuous component
parametrized à la Sandage (1986)7 , thus allowing for
both an increasing and a decreasing SFH phase, on top
of which random bursts of star formation are added.
Stellar metallicity evolves according to the SFH (see
Zibetti et al. (2019)), with initial and final values randomly generated in the range 1/50 − 2.5Z . Finally,
for 75% of the models, the effect of dust attenuation is
included following the model of Charlot & Fall (2000)
that separates the contribution of the birth clouds affecting stars younger than 107 yr and the contribution
of the ISM affecting stars of all ages.
The Bayesian modeling approach assumes the likelihood of each model to be ∝ exp(−χ2 /2). The probability distribution function (PDF) of each physical
parameter of interest are computed by weighing the
prior distribution of the models in a given parameter by
their likelihood, marginalizing over all the other parameters. We additionally used the information from the
mid-IR flux limit to restrict the sample of acceptable
models to those that have a SFR consistent with the
24 µm-based upper limits and detections (see Section
4.4.2). The median and the 16th and 84th percentiles
of the PDFs are adopted as the fiducial estimates and
their uncertainties for each parameter. Note that this
approach allows the derivation of realistic uncertainties
on the key physical parameters, accounting for both
the observational errors and the intrinsic degeneracies
among different parameters.
The stellar mass, mass-weighted mean stellar age,
effective dust attenuation (A(g)) and SFR, averaged
over the last 100 Myr for our sample, are reported in
Table 2. In this table, the SFR limits from nebular
line and 24 µm emission (see Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2)
are also listed. Stellar masses are within the range of
log10 (M∗ /M ) = 11.23 − 11.79, with a median of 11.57.
Compared to Belli et al. (2017), this sample is on average more massive, which is reflected by the brighter
K-band magnitudes (see Figure 1). Such massive quiescent galaxies have also been found over a larger area
in Arcila-Osejo et al. (2019). The SFR limits and dustcorrected stellar masses, together with the mean stellar
mass weighted ages of ∼ 1.4 Gyr, confirm the expectations from the selection that this is, in fact, a sample of massive recently quenched galaxies. Three of the
galaxies are double sources and the stellar masses are
corrected in Section 4.6.

et al. (2019)

4.4.1. Rest-frame optical emission lines
In order to confirm the quiescence nature of our galaxies upper limits on [OII]λ3727 and Hα emission are measured. These are converted into upper limits of the unobscured SFRs following Equation (2) and (3) in Kennicutt (1998), under the assumptions of solar abundance
ratio and that all massive star formation is traced by
ionized gas. A 3σ flux upper limit is determined by
summing up the flux error density squared over a region of ∆λ = 1000 km/s (similar to 300 − 500 km/s line
dispersions):

σf2 lux δλ2 .
(1)
F3σ limit = 3
Here σf lux and δλ are the flux uncertainty and bin size,
respectively. Note that we do not introduce any dust
extinction in this conversion, as this is largely unconstrained (see Section 4.4.3 for an estimated upper limit
on the dust extinction). We find unobscured SFR upper
limits that are consistent with the expectation that these
galaxies are quiescent (−10 < log10 (sSFR/yr) < −11.5).
The difference between the [OII]λ3727 and Hα SFR limits are < 11 M∗ /yr, and in Table 2 the lowest SFR upper
limits are listed.

The SFR, derived from rest-frame optical emission
lines, represents a lower limit to the total star formation
in the presence of strong dust attenuation. Therefore,
the SFR from the Spitzer /MIPS 24 µm emission (Wu
et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2008; Rieke et al. 2009; Kennicutt et al. 2009) are estimated under the assumption of
zero or subdominant AGN emission. Here, the 24 µm
flux densities (or 3σ upper limits for sources undetected
at 24 µm), from the most recent “super deblended” FIR
COSMOS catalog (Jin et al. 2018), are adopted. To derive SFR estimates, the z = 2 main-sequence SED template of Magdis et al. (2012) is rescaled to the measured
24 µm flux densities (or the 3σ upper limits) of our targets. The emerging total infrared luminosity (LIR ) of
the templates are converted to SFR through the LIR SFR relation of Kennicutt (1998), tuned to the adopted
Chabrier IMF of this study. Detections corresponding
to a median SFR ∼ 20 M yr−1 are found for 5 of the
galaxies that are undetected in the 24 µm catalog (Le
Floc’h et al. 2009). The remaining galaxies are not individually detected and we thus fix them to their 3σ upper
limit. UV-90676 and CP-561356 that have upper limits

contribution to the mid-IR heating arises from AGN,
we check if there are any radio counterparts detected in
Jin et al. (2018). Radio emission is detected in 5 sources
at 1.4 GHz and in 5 sources at 3 GHz (indicated with
symbols in Table 2), showing that AGN heating could
be responsible for the elevated mid-IR SFR estimates.
Further treatment of the radio detections will be part of
a future paper (Cortzen at al. in prep).
The SFRs derived from our stellar population analysis (Section 4.3) are consistent with SFR ∼ 0 M∗ yr−1
for all galaxies in our sample. In Table 1, we list the
3σ upper limits on these SFR limits. However, even
considering the most conservative upper limits on the
SFR from the 24 µm emission, our sample of MQGs lies
∼ 2 dex below the SFR main-sequence at their redshifts,
confirming their quiescent nature.

z = 2 from Speagle et al. (2014) is shown in dark purple,

the best-fit relation. The 24 µm MIPS SFR detections (red

et al. (2018) (diamonds) in black upper limits. Our sample of galaxies have suppressed SFR compared to the mainsequence at z = 2 and can be considered truly quiescent

listed in Table 2.
4.4.3. Comparison of different star formation tracers
Figure 4 shows the position of the sample of MQGs
in the log(SFR) − log(M∗ ) main-sequence at z = 2. For
reference, the SFR main-sequence at matching redshift
from Speagle et al. (2014) is shown, extrapolated to the
stellar mass range log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11.1 covered by our
galaxies.
The rest-frame optical SFR limits are systematically
lower than the mid-IR estimates (both probing 10 − 100
Myrs timescales). This suggests either that the starforming regions are strongly obscured and/or AGN dust
heating (Fumagalli et al. 2014). Under the assumption
of no AGN contribution to the heating that produces
the mid-IR emission (see also Section 6.4), the dust extinction is estimated by comparing the obscured and unobscured SFR estimates, resulting in a mean extinction
of A(v) < 1 − 2 consistent with our SED fit derived A(g)
(g-band) extinction. In order to judge if a significant

4.5. Galaxy structure and sizes
The 2-D stellar light distribution traced by HST /WFC3
HF 160W imaging are modeled with the χ2 -minimization
fitting code GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002) in order to retrieve the structural parameters of our sample of MQGs.
A first run of SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) allows us to detect the objects in each field and to obtain
an initial guess for the structural parameters. Postage
stamp for each target is constructed such that it encloses an ellipse with a major axis 2.5 times the Kron
radius obtained by SExtractor. The local sky level in
each stamp is calculated using Galapagos (Barden et al.
2012). This sky level is passed to GALFIT and kept
fixed during the fitting. For the WFC3 data, a combination of the TINYTIM8 -simulated point spread function
(PSF) and an empirical stacked star PSF are used. For
the NICMOS data, an empirical stacked PSF are used.
Finally, GALFIT is run on each postage stamp,
adopting a flexible Sérsic profile for every source (Sérsic
1968),

avoid any unphysical solutions (effective radius > 0.2
pixels, q > 0.1, 0.5 < n < 8). Initially, all targets are
fit with n as a free parameter. In unstable cases where
the maximum or minimum n are reached, the images
fixing the Sérsic index at either n = 1 or n = 4 are
re-fit, choosing the model providing the smallest χ2 as
the best-fit solution. These two choices represent realistic descriptions of an early-type galaxy dominated by
either a disk or a bulge. Throughout the whole fitting
procedure, neighboring objects are either modeled or
masked, depending on their proximity to the main target. A 10% measurement uncertainty on the size is (van
der Wel et al. 2008; Newman et al. 2012) shown to be a
fair representation. This conservative error estimate is
thus adopted. The semi-major axis, Re,maj , is adopted
as the effective radius in the following sections. The
best-fit parameters and their uncertainties are reported
in Table 3.

GALFIT is run several times to ensure that the solutions correspond to a global minimum in the minimization algorithm for each image, by varying the initial
guesses of the total magnitude, effective radius and
Sérsic index. The parameters are constrained so to

In Figure 5, we present the rest-frame UV (IF 814W )
and optical (HF 160W ) images along with the GALFIT
model and residual. The morphologies of these galaxies
are classified in the HF 160W image according to Conselice et al. (2005) and they fall into the two categories
for quiescent systems: Ellipticals (E) and Peculiars (P).
When available, the spectroscopic observations are used
to determine the distance in redshift space to objects
that fall in the X-shooter slit (see Section 4.2). The
majority of sources turn out not to be associated with
the central galaxy. 9/15 galaxies are categorized as
Elliptical galaxies while the remaining are categorized
as Peculiar galaxies with major mergers (UV-108899,
UV-250513, CP-561356), minor mergers (UV-105842,
CP-1291751) and/or strong tidal/post-merger features
(UV-105842, UV-90676). The galaxies UV-108899, UV250513 and CP-561356 are confirmed as ongoing major
mergers in the following section. The classifications and
the morphological parameters are listed in Table 3.
4.6. Spectroscopic confirmation and stellar mass
correction of ongoing major mergers
The RB color images, in Figure 2, reveal that three
galaxies (UV-108899, UV-250513, CP-561356) appear to
be double systems. The spectra, shown in the same figure, are the total extraction of the combined light from
the two galaxies. These objects are within close proximity and the light in the reduced 2-D frames are blended
to an unknown extent (due to limited seeing). At the
expense of drastically decreasing the S/N, an attempt
to separate the sources and determine if their individual
redshift measurements can confirm their proximity are
made.

16

Stockmann et al

For each system, the resolved 1-D HST HF 160W light
profile (extracted parallel to the X-shooter slit) is overlaid on top of the wavelength collapsed 2-D spectrum
trace. A double Gaussian profile fit allowed us to gauge
the amount of blending and to make a conservative
extraction of each individual galaxy, minimizing crosssource contamination. In Figure 6, the individual extractions and the best-fit to the composite spectrum
from Section 4.3 are shown.
Because of the low S/N of the individual conservative
flux extractions, the estimation of the velocity offset are
refrained, since it would be dominated by large uncertainties. However, the galaxies are within close physical
proximity due to the matching absorption lines shown
in the figure and can be considered ongoing quiescent
(dry) major-mergers. This confirmation is important as,
in the following section, it can be used to correct their
stellar masses, prior to presenting them in the mass-size
plane (see Section 5.3).
Spectroscopic confirmation allows us to deblend the
composite stellar mass of each system using the HF 160W
magnitude as a proxy for tracing the bulk of the stars in
the galaxies. The GALFIT modeled HF 160W flux ratio
supports the fact that these galaxies are major mergers
with mass ratios of 1 : 1 − 3. We used the flux ratio to
correct the stellar masses as:
Fi
M∗,i = M∗,tot
= M∗,tot RFlux ,
(3)
Fi + Fj
where i and j refer to the two merging galaxies and
F is the total flux from GALFIT. The corrected stellar masses (M∗,c ) and the relative flux ratio scaling,
RFlux , are listed in Table 3, with sources names matching the numbering in Figure 5. Following this correction,
the galaxies still classify as MQGs with stellar masses,
log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11.
5. RESULTS

5.1. Minimal progenitor bias
A major issue preventing us from deriving a consistent evolutionary picture connecting galaxy populations
across time is the “progenitor bias” problem (e.g. van
Dokkum & Franx 1996; Carollo et al. 2013). When
comparing galaxies across time, the implicit assumption
is that the high redshift sample contains all progenitors of the low redshift reference sample. However, the
fraction of quenched galaxies has been found to grow
over time (Buitrago et al. 2013) introducing an unknown
bias when comparing samples of galaxies across different
epochs.
One approach, that has been suggested to minimize
the progenitor bias, is comparing the evolution of galax-

ies at fixed velocity dispersion (see e.g. Belli et al.
2014a). Archaeological studies (van der Wel et al.
2009; Graves et al. 2009; Bezanson et al. 2012) find evidence suggesting that the velocity dispersion in quiescent galaxies remains approximately unchanged across
cosmic time (z < 1.5). In such a scenario the velocity dispersion must be weakly affected by the average
merger history, which according to the numerical study
by Hilz et al. (2012) occurs for minor merger-driven evolution. A detailed discussion on fixed velocity dispersion
evolution is given in Belli et al. (2014a, 2017). Another
way to minimize the progenitor bias has been to study
galaxy populations at constant cumulative number density (CND) instead of fixed velocity dispersion or stellar
mass (see e.g. Mundy et al. 2015). This approach are
introduced in van Dokkum et al. (2010) and refined further in Behroozi et al. (2013) and Leja et al. (2013). In
Section 2.1, a sample of massive galaxies with central
stellar population ages suggesting formation at z > 2
are introduced. This sample is volume limited and represents the most massive early-type systems observed
in the local Universe. In order to draw a meaningful
comparison, a subgroup of the most massive galaxies at
z = 0 are selected and matched with the CND at z = 2.
This will now be referred to as the “fixed” CND. This
approach is based on the assumption that the rank of
galaxies, within the stellar mass function, is not strongly
affected across cosmic time. This occurs if the stellar
mass continuously grows from z = 2 − 0, implying the
availability of surrounding material to accrete (or events
that trigger secondary SF, although this is not expected
for the massive quiescent galaxies at z > 2) (Brammer
et al. 2011; Behroozi et al. 2013; Muzzin et al. 2013b;
Marchesini et al. 2014).
First, the CND of massive (log(M∗ /M ) > 11.2) UVJ
quiescent galaxies in the redshift range 1.9 < z < 2.5
is estimated using the Muzzin et al. (2013a) catalog.
The stellar-mass limit represents the lower limit on the
standard deviation of the mean stellar mass from the
sample of galaxies studied in this paper. Our sample is
22 % stellar mass complete using these selection criteria.
We count 58 galaxies inside a comoving volume spanned
by this redshift range giving a n(log(M∗ /M ) > 11.2) =
9.7 × 10−6 M pc−3 .
The MASSIVE galaxy sample is trimmed starting
from the most massive object of the survey and including progressively less massive systems until we reach
the fixed CND of the massive UVJ quiescent galaxies at
z ∼ 2. The final fixed CND-matched MASSIVE sample
consists of the 25 most massive local elliptical galaxies with stellar masses of log(M∗ /M ) > 11.70. The
fixed CND-matched MASSIVE sample is referred to as

Ultra Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z & 2
“MASSIVE(n)” hereafter. The MASSIVE(n) sample is
considered a minimal progenitor biased sample and used
as our local reference sample in Section 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.
The CND evolution suffers from large uncertainties
from individual merger histories causing scatter in the
mass rank which is the main uncertainty for the highest
stellar masses (Behroozi et al. 2013; Torrey et al. 2017).
In Torrey et al. (2017), they estimate the mass rank scatter for log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11 galaxies in Illustris (Genel
et al. 2014; Nelson et al. 2015) by forward modeling of
the cumulative number density. Their forward modeling, referred to as Density Distribution Functions, is well
described by a lognormal distribution and the uncertainties can thus be treated as confidence intervals. For
massive galaxies the dominating uncertainty, the mass
rank scatter, introduces a uncertainty of factor of ∼ 2
(within 80 % confidence intervals) on the CND following
the evolution from z = 2 to 0. In Behroozi et al. (2013),
they find a similar uncertainty for the fixed CND evolution. This uncertainty on the CND evolution from
the mass rank scatter is adopted and used to repeat the
selection of the local reference sample resulting in a corresponding uncertainty on the limit of the stellar mass
+0.07
cut log(M∗ /M ) > 11.70−0.10
and thus the number of
galaxies in the local reference sample.
As an alternative approach to the fixed CND matching, the probabilistic approach from Wellons & Torrey
(2017) is used to estimate the CND at z = 0. In Appendix D, the results (from Figure 7, 8 and 9) for both a
fixed and probabilistic CND matching approach is presented. The choice of CND-matching method does not
affect the qualitative results of this paper.
5.2. Kinematic evolution of massive quiescent galaxies
from z = 2 to 0
In Figure 7, the stellar velocity dispersion-size plane
which allows us to study the kinematic evolution of massive quiescent galaxies from z = 2 − 0, is presented.
The ongoing major merger galaxies are included to show
that their incorrect composite dispersion measurement
increase the scatter if not properly accounted for.
The mean velocity dispersion of the sample studied in
this paper is 289 ± 58 km/s (without major mergers).
This is consistent with previous z > 2 massive quiescent
galaxy literature (see studies shown in Figure 7) with a
mean dispersion of 272 ± 31 km/s. Our velocity dispersion and size measurements (including other structural
parameters) for CP-1242752 (indicated by blue square
in Figure 7) are consistent with previously published values (van de Sande et al. 2013; Belli et al. 2014b; Kriek
et al. 2016; Belli et al. 2017).

17

Comparing the median dispersion of our study to that
of the local MASSIVE(n) sample, a shallow or no kinematic evolution from z = 2 − 0 is found. In Figure 7,
significant effective size evolution consistent with earlier
findings are observed (Newman et al. 2012; van der Wel
et al. 2014). The effect of the mass rank scatter on the
fixed CND matching is shown as the purple shading
around the median evolution. These shadings outline
the variation on median when using upper and lower
limit of the CND matching (based on the stellar mass
cut log(M∗ /M ) > 11.70+0.07
−0.10 ) from the mass rank scatter.
Half of the morphologies of compact massive galaxies
at z ∼ 2 have been suggested to be disk-dominated (van
der Wel et al. 2011). So far only one spatially resolved
study of a rotating disk quiescent galaxy at this epoch
has been discovered (Geier et al. 2013; Toft et al. 2017;
Newman et al. 2018). The line of sight measured velocity
broadening of the absorption lines could be a combination of both rotation and dispersion in the presence of
a disk-dominated system (see an analytical prescription
in Belli et al. 2017). Care must therefore be taken when
comparing z > 2 spatially unresolved dispersion with
resolved local measurements.
Wuyts et al. (2011) shows that the stellar light distribution of galaxies, measured by the Sérsic index, traces
well the log(SFR) − log(M∗ ) relation, separating disk
and spheroidal galaxies by n = 2.5 at z < 1.5. Under
the assumption that this is valid at z = 2, we classify
our galaxies by Sérsic index and find that 92% of our
galaxies have spheroidal (n > 2.5) morphologies (when
excluding the ongoing major mergers). If Sérsic index
n > 2.5 is a good tracer of dispersion-dominated systems at z > 2, it suggests that our sample of galaxy
dispersion measurements are not strongly contaminated
by rotation.
A recent study by Veale et al. (2018) presents the spatially resolved velocity dispersion measurements for the
MASSIVE Survey sample. Here, log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11.7
galaxies (similar to our stellar mass cut of the MASSIVE(n) sample) all have velocity dispersions in the
range 200 < σ < 350 km/s at all radii (< 15 − 30 kpc).
This rules out the possibility that the shallow dispersion evolution comparison is driven by spatial resolution.
A comparison to the fixed CND-matched MASSIVE(n)
sample establish that the dispersion remains nearly unchanged.
Negligible median dispersion evolution of our MQGs
across the last 10 billion years (z = 2 − 0) is found
in Figure 7. In the absence of spatially resolved spectroscopy, we make use of the morphological classifica-

be strongly contaminated by rotation. Studying the evolution of galaxies at fixed dispersion has been suggested
as a method to minimise progenitor bias (e.g. Belli et al.
2014b).
5.3. Stellar mass-size plane for massive quiescent
galaxies
In Figure 8, the stellar mass-size plane (log10 M∗ −
Re,maj ) is presented which allows us to study the structural and stellar mass evolution of massive quiescent
galaxies since z ∼ 2. The three ongoing major-merger
galaxies with resolved sizes of the individual galaxies
(Section 4.5) and their flux corrected stellar masses (Section 4.6) are shown in the figure. The post-merger stellar masses and sizes of these are predicted using the
argument of virialization from Bezanson et al. (2009).
The resulting position of post-merger galaxies is consistent with the average locus of the most massive
(log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11.5) individual galaxies in our sample, showing that a way to form the most massive qui-

The best-fit relation to the galaxies of this study is shown
in dashed red. The purple arrow shows the median evolution between our study and the MASSIVE(n) sample. The
shaded purple area represents the uncertainty on the median
of the MASSIVE(n) sample when the mass rank scatter from

in Section 5.2). The median mass-size evolution of MQGs
from z = 2 − 0 can be explained primarily by minor mergers.

escent galaxies in our sample could be major quiescentto-quiescent dry galaxy mergers (Naab et al. 2006).
A best fit relation to the galaxies in this study, including the major merger separated galaxies, reveal
a shallower slope than what are found in van der
Wel et al. (2014) z = 2.25 mass-size relation, but in
a better agreement with Mowla et al. (2018). The
best fit parameters, using a similar parametrization
(r/kpc = A(M∗ /(5 · 1010 ))α ), are log(A) = 0.19 and
α = 0.42. The stellar mass for CP-1243752 (blue square
in Figure 8) is consistent within 1σ standard deviation
with van de Sande et al. (2013) and Belli et al. (2017)
and within 1.1σ for the stellar mass published in Kriek
et al. (2016).

Ultra Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z & 2
The distribution of our sample shows that z > 2
MQGs are ∼ 2 times more compact than objects with
the same stellar mass in the local Universe (Shen et al.
2003), which is a well-established result in previous
works (van de Sande et al. 2013; Belli et al. 2017).
The median stellar mass and size for our (MASSIVE(n))
sample log(M∗ /M ) = 11.48 (11.77) and Re,maj /kpc =
3.42 (13.55) show that a doubling (∼ 0.3 dex) in stellar
mass and a factor of 4 in size evolution are required to
bring the two samples into qualitative agreement.
Using the method from Bezanson et al. (2009) for predicting stellar mass and size growth, minor and major
merger tracks are shown in the mass-size plane. The median mass-size evolution between our z > 2 MQGs and
the local MASSIVE(n) sample could be explained by minor merger-predicted size and stellar mass growth. The
tracks start at the median size and stellar mass of our
sample (only red symbols). The qualitative conclusions
remain the same when using a mean instead of a median or changing the choice of reference (with/without
the major merger galaxies).
The median logarithmic mass-size slope is α =
α
1.78+0.37
−0.29 (r ∝ M∗ ). The uncertainties are determined
based on the CND mass rank scatter shown as the
purple shaded area in Figure 8. This confirms the suggestion that minor mergers (α = 2), compared to major
mergers (α = 1), are the preferred evolutionary path in
the mass-size plane.
In line with earlier studies (van de Sande et al. 2013;
Belli et al. 2017; van der Wel et al. 2014; Mowla et al.
2018), we find that our sample of z > 2 MQGs is compact in the stellar mass-size plane and further suggests
that minor merger-driven size evolution (Bluck et al.
2012; Newman et al. 2012; Hilz et al. 2012, 2013; Oogi
& Habe 2013; Fagioli et al. 2016) is preferred when comparing to the fixed CND-matched MASSIVE(n) sample.
5.4. Stellar-dynamical mass plane for massive
quiescent galaxies
In Figure 9, the dynamical-to-stellar mass relation for
massive quiescent galaxies is plotted in order to study
the interplay between the stellar and total (dynamical)
mass potential over time. The dynamical mass derived
from the Jeans equation (Jeans 1902) for symmetrical
systems is as follows:
Re,maj σ 2
.

Here, Re,maj is the effective semi-major axis, σ is the
stellar velocity dispersion, G is the gravitational constant and β is a parameter incorporating the full complexity of a collisionless systems with radial dependent parameters of density, dispersion, and velocity

anisotropy. Following Cappellari et al. (2006), β(n) =
8.87 − 0.831n + 0.0241n2 is adopted where n is the
Sérsic index (Sérsic 1968). The representation of β is
a good approximation for symmetric systems such as an
elliptical galaxy that is well represented by a de Vaucouleurs profile. Taylor et al. (2010a) and Cappellari
et al. (2013) show that using such a parametrization of
β yields dynamical masses in better agreement with the
stellar masses when the sizes, are estimated using a 2dimensional Sérsic fitting method, rather than a fixed
value of β.
The galaxies of this study are consistent with the
stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio, M∗ /Mdyn < 1, within
the large uncertainties. A ratio > 1 is referred to as a
non-physical (forbidden) region where the total mass is
smaller than the mass of the stars. The galaxy, UV230929, is located in this region at 1.1σ standard deviation from the M∗ /Mdyn = 1 relation. Unfortunately,
our large uncertainties prohibit trustworthy estimates of
the total dust+gas mass for our sample. In Belli et al.
(2017), it is suggested that dispersion dominated systems with n > 2.5 lie closer to the M∗ /Mdyn = 1 relation
at z ∼ 2.
Compared to previous z > 2 massive quiescent galaxy
studies (see legend in Figure 9), our sample occupies
a similar dynamical mass range but has larger stellar
masses. This is further discussed in Section 6.3. The
dynamical mass for CP-1243752 (indicated by a blue
square) is consistent with the previous measurements in
van de Sande et al. (2013) and Belli et al. (2017).
A comparison between our study with the MASSIVE(n) sample is made to learn about the fixed CND
evolution in the dynamical-stellar mass plane. The median evolution in Figure 9 illustrates that the dynamical
mass evolves 2× faster than stellar mass within the effective radii. This means that the galaxies evolve such
that the M∗ /Mdyn ratio decreases from z = 2 to 0.
The minor and major merger evolution are shown for
constant velocity dispersion evolution (∆r ∝ M∗α ), with
α = 1 for major merger and 2 for minor merger evolution. This is motivated by the shallow/constant dispersion evolution found in Section 5.2, when also comparing to the MASSIVE(n) sample. The median evolution
from z = 2 to present day prefers the minor merger predicted evolution when comparing our study to the MASSIVE(n) sample in the dynamical-stellar mass plane.
The median evolution from our study to the MASSIVE(n) sample at present day, in the dynamical-stellar
mass plane, is consistent with minor merger evolution
that is similar to what is found in Figure 7 and 8.

et al. 2013; Kriek et al. 2016; Belli et al. 2017). The calculated dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio doubles from z = 2 to
0 when comparing to the fixed CND-matched MASSIVE(n)
sample.
6. DISCUSSION

The structural and kinematic evolution for massive
galaxies from z = 2 to present is explored by assuming
that the galaxies, in this study, are the progenitors of the
MASSIVE(n) sample. Such a claim has been motivated
by a fixed CND-matching between the two samples of
galaxies. This suggests that these galaxies undergo significant size growth together with shallow velocity dispersion evolution, driving up the dynamical-to-stellar
mass ratio from z = 2 to 0. The role of major mergers
in the evolution of massive galaxies is discussed following an interpretation using idealized and cosmological
simulations. Furthermore, the origin of the dust heating, observed in the MIR and FIR emission, is discussed.
Finally, the caveats are presented.
6.1. Quiescent-to-quiescent major mergers
Three galaxies in our sample, initially unresolved in
ground-based imaging, are found in HST images to be

double sources and confirmed with X-shooter to be ongoing major merger systems (see Section 4.6). In this
section, we discuss how the high major merger fraction
(6/18) affects the prevalence of minor merger structural
evolution of massive QG (found in Section 5) and if the
high fraction could be caused by a selection bias.
Following the definition in Man et al. (2012) we find
a pair fraction of 20 ± 12% when assuming no projected
sources (hNprojected i = 0) and using the Poisson error
estimate. In COSMOS and UDS a pair fraction of 10 %
major mergers are found for massive (log(M∗ /M ) >
11) galaxies at z = 2 (Mundy et al. 2017). In the case
that the observed major mergers are representative for
the complete sample of massive QGs we can estimate the
number of major mergers each galaxy undergo (Nmerger )
following the prescription in Man et al. (2016a). Under
the assumption that the merger rate is constant from
z = 2 to 0, equation (3) in Man et al. (2016a) can
be written as, Nmerger = ∆tfpair /tobs . The pair fraction, fpair = 0.2, observation time tobs = 0.8 Gyr (from
z = 1.9 − 2.5) and time of evolution ∆t ∼ 10 Gyr is
used to estimate the number of mergers from z = 2 to
0. These numbers reproduce a major merger rate of
∼ 1 for a pair fraction of 10 % similar to what was suggested in Man et al. (2012). For a 20 % pair fraction we
find that on average each galaxy undergo Nmerger = 2.5
mergers between 0 < z < 2. This number of 1:1 major mergers would corresponds to a stellar mass increase
of 0.5 dex which is inconsistent with the stellar mass of
the MASSIVE(n) sample (see Figure 8). In the case of a
10 % pair fraction the stellar mass increase is consistent
with the average stellar mass of the MASSIVE(n) sample, however in this case another mechanism must then
be in place to produce the large size growth observed
between our sample and the MASSIVE(n) galaxies.
Our sample was selected to be UVJ quiescent and
K-band bright, which could have introduced a bias for
ground-based unresolved bright red systems like quiescent to quiescent galaxy major mergers (see also Section
6.5). See also Mowla et al. (2018) and Marsan et al.
(2019) that addresses the issue of close pairs of massive QG at z ∼ 2. If this selection bias is responsible
for the high pair fractions, this could explain why we
observe that the stellar mass-size evolution from z = 2
to 0 is dominated by minor mergers (see Figure 8). The
majority of our major merger targets are in the low stellar mass end of our sample (log(M∗ /M ) < 11.5). This
could indicate that a possible way to produce ultra massive (log(M∗ /M ) > 11.5) QGs could be via quiescentto-quiescent galaxy major mergers at z > 2. A scenario
involving early time major and late time minor merger

Ultra Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z & 2
evolution will be testable with larger samples of massive
QGs at z > 2.5.
6.2. Minor-merger size evolution at constant dispersion
+0.37
In Figure 8, a slope of α = 1.78−0.29
is found for
the mass-size evolution of our MQG from z = 2 to 0.
Such an evolution can be interpreted using the analytical framework from Bezanson et al. (2009) and Naab
et al. (2009) which find that minor merger-driven growth
is needed to produce a mass-size slope of α = 2. An extended numerical treatment from Hilz et al. (2012) finds
that when including the effect of escaping particles (a
process arising from virialization following merger interaction), they recover a steeper mass-size slope (α =
2.4) alongside a constant dispersion evolution for minor
merger-driven growth. Such a scenario could explain
the observed size growth and shallow dispersion evolution observed.
The scenario presented in Hilz et al. (2012) occurs for
two-component (stellar+halo) systems when they undergo 1:10 minor merger evolution. They reproduce the
structural evolution found in Bezanson et al. (2009) and
Naab et al. (2009) when simulating minor-merger evolution of stellar-only systems. According to Hilz et al.
(2012) this suggests that the growth of the dark matter
halo is an important ingredient necessary to cause the
shallow dispersion evolution together with the expected
size growth evolution we find in this study. Moreover,
Hilz et al. (2012) shows that major mergers increase
the dispersion and size proportional to the stellar mass.
This is not what is found when comparing the size and
dispersion evolution with the MASSIVE(n) sample (see
Figure 7 and 8). In the minor merger scenario, the velocity dispersion would be maintained in the inner region
of the galaxy, as additional stellar mass is accreted in
the outer parts from tidally stripped satellite systems.
Over time, this would change the stellar light distribution on the outskirts of the galaxy, causing a continuous
growth of the half-light radius (van Dokkum et al. 2010;
Hill et al. 2017).
In UV-105842, we may be observing a direct example
of the minor merger-driven size increase. A small satellite system within close (spectroscopically confirmed)
proximity of the central galaxy is found. Based on the
flux-ratio estimated from the GALFIT modeling we estimate a stellar mass ratio of 1:12+6
−3 for this minor merger,
consistent with the average 1:16 ratio estimated by Newman et al. (2012). To double its stellar mass (as suggested by the median ∼ 0.3 dex increase derived for our
sample), the galaxy would need to go through ∼ 12 such
minor mergers between z=2 and 0. Other minor merger
stellar mass ratios of 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 suggested by

21

Hilz et al. (2013) and Bédorf & Portegies Zwart (2013),
would correspond to 5, 10, and 20 minor mergers between z=2 and 0 for a similar stellar mass increase. In
Man et al. (2016a) issues related to the translation of
the H-band flux ratio to a stellar mass ratio (e.g. due to
M/L ratio variation in galaxies), directly affecting the
above argument, are discussed.
Many observational (Bluck et al. 2012; McLure et al.
2013; Fagioli et al. 2016; Matharu et al. 2019; Zahid et al.
2019) and numerical (Naab et al. 2009; Oser et al. 2012;
Oogi & Habe 2013; Tapia et al. 2014; Naab et al. 2014;
Remus et al. 2017) studies find that minor mergers could
be a dominant process for the size growth of massive
galaxies, but it may not be able to explain the the full
size evolution (Cimatti et al. 2012; Newman et al. 2012).
Feedback processes have been shown to also affect the
size growth (e.g. Lackner et al. 2012; Hirschmann et al.
2013). Specifically AGN feedback is shown, by modern
simulations, to be necessary to reproduce the observed
size evolution (see Dubois et al. 2013; Choi et al. 2018).
6.3. Stellar-to-dynamical mass evolution
We found that the dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio
shown in Figure 9 increases by a factor of two within
MQGs from z = 2 to 0. This could be attributed to
either IMF changes of the stellar population (Cappellari
et al. 2012) affecting the stellar mass estimates or an
increase in the dark matter fraction within the effective
half-light radius.
Numerical simulations find that minor merger-driven
evolution alters the distribution of stars over time from
a core to a core-envelope system by accretion of particles in the outskirts of the galaxy (Hopkins et al. 2009;
Hilz et al. 2012, 2013; Frigo & Balcells 2017; Lagos et al.
2018). A consequence of this is that the central dispersion remains constant while the half-light radius grows,
encompassing a larger part of the dark matter halo and
effectively increasing the dark matter fraction over time
(Hilz et al. 2012).
A mass-size evolution similar to what we find is, according to Hilz et al. (2013), caused by a massive dark
matter halo that drives the accretion of dry (collisionless) minor mergers at large radii through tidal stripping. This inside-out growth increases the effective halfmass radius to encompass dark matter dominated regions which might explain the increase of the dynamicalto-stellar mass fraction within the half-light radius that
we observe.
Care must be taken when interpreting the observations in terms of idealized numerical simulations. However, Remus et al. (2017) also find that the central dark
matter fraction increases with decreasing redshift when

22

Stockmann et al

comparing different cosmological simulations. Furthermore, observational evidence for inside-out growth in
massive galaxies is presented in Szomoru et al. (2012).
In Figure 9, we find that our sample is consistent with
the dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of one suggesting low
dark matter fractions at z ∼ 2. For a stellar mass increase of 0.3 dex (similar to our median evolution), Hilz
et al. (2012) predict a dark matter fraction increase of
∼ 70 % within the effective radius. If we assume that
the mass of the galaxy consists only of dark matter and
stars, we can estimate the dark matter mass fractions
(MDM /Mdyn = 1 − M∗ /Mdyn ), from the dynamicalto-stellar median ratio at z = 2 and 0, to be 7+24
−7 %
and 56 ± 8 %, respectively. This suggests an increase
of the dark matter fraction within the effective radius
of 17 − 64 %. Note, however, that this increase cannot purely be associated with the dark matter from the
minor mergers as the growing half-light radius similarly
encompasses more of the central dark matter halo and
also contributes to this increase.
According to Remus et al. (2017), the mass growth of
massive galaxies can be explained by two stages: 1) High
redshift in situ mass growth resulting in a dense stellar
component in the center of the potential where the dark
matter fraction is low, 2) dry merger events dominate
the mass growth at lower redshift (with major mergers
being rare) resulting in the build-up of a stellar envelope
increasing the half-light radius and thus the dark matter
fraction (similar to the interpretation above).
6.4. Dust heating in massive quiescent galaxies at
z>2
The 24 µm SFR limit, used to restrict the stellar population models, results in specific SFRs for our galaxies
of log10 (sSFR/yr) < −10. Nonetheless, stronger limits
on the specific SFR can be obtained if the source of dust
heating is not caused by recent star formation. In Section 4.4.3, the information from optical nebular emission
and mid-IR is combined to set stringent limits on the
SFR of our sample (see also Figure 4). This information
reveals that our sample lies 1.5 dex below z = 2 the star
formation - stellar mass relation of (Speagle et al. 2014)
(extrapolated to log10 (M /M∗ ) ∼ 11.5).
Low-luminosity AGN is shown to be common in massive, log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11, quiescent galaxies at z < 1.5,
through excess radio emission in stacked samples (Man
et al. 2016b; Gobat et al. 2018). Six galaxies, in our
sample, have direct radio detections; three of them with
matching mid-IR detections (see Table 2). This could
be evidence in line with the results from Olsen et al.
(2013) who find a high fraction of AGN in massive quiescent galaxies at 1.5 < z < 2.5 using X-ray stacking.

Low luminosity AGN activity has, in Schawinski et al.
(2009); Best & Heckman (2012), been associated with
the suppression of SF which is an important effect in
maintaining galaxies quiescent. Low levels of dust heating have also been associated with evolved stellar populations as a significant source to emit at wavelengths
beyond > 160 µm (Salim et al. 2009; Bendo et al. 2012;
Fumagalli et al. 2014; Utomo et al. 2014). However, with
no detections in the Herschel/PACS bands, we cannot
rule this scenario out. In the case where AGN are indeed
the dominant dust heating source in the galaxies, we can
expect that the 24 µm flux does not arise from residual SF. This is consistent with Whitaker et al. (2017)
that find no strongly obscured SF in massive quiescent
galaxies at z > 2. Assuming the 24 µm emission is
not due to obscured starformation, we find a specific
SFR, log10 (sSFR/yr) < −11, based purely on the optical emission limits/detections. The MIR-to-radio emission of the sample will, in a future publication, be investigated in detail (Cortzen et al. in prep).
6.5. Caveats
The main limitations of the results are here presented
in bullet points:
• Overestimated stellar masses would lead to a shallower mass-size evolution and dynamical-to-stellar
mass ratio evolution. Nonetheless, substantially
overestimated stellar masses are ruled out by our
dynamical masses being in agreement with previous kinematic studies of massive quiescent galaxies
at z > 2 (Toft et al. 2012; van de Sande et al. 2013;
Bezanson et al. 2013; Belli et al. 2014b, 2017).
• If rotation is significant in massive quiescent galaxies at z > 2, the measured velocity dispersion, depending on the inclination, could have an unknown
contribution from rotation resulting in heightened
dispersion measurements. On the other hand,
dispersion measurements from face-on rotationdominated galaxies could result in low values.
This would further drive the dynamical mass artificially down. Such issues should be addressed by
spatially resolved spectroscopy where the Vrot /σ
can be estimated.
• Previous studies (Mancini et al. 2010) have suggested that sizes might be underestimated due
to non-detection of low luminosity profile wings.
However, ultra-deep imaging out to many effective
radii does not find that this is the case (Szomoru
et al. 2010, 2011).
• Dynamical-to-stellar mass evolution is sensitive to
the determination of β(n). The prescription from

Ultra Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z & 2
Cappellari et al. (2006) is used, yet, this relation is
determined from local galaxies and is assumed to
be representative for dynamical systems at z ∼ 2.
When comparing with the MASSIVE(n) sample,
we assume a Sérsic index of n = 4, to be a fair representation of a spheroidal system. When changing the choice of β = 2 − 6 for the MASSIVE(n)
sample, the conclusion that the ratio must evolve
from z = 2 − 0 remains.
• The sample is 60 % mass complete for the massive (log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11) and K-band brightest
(K < 20.5) UVJ quiescent galaxies at 1.9 < z <
2.5. This selection depends strongly on the performance of the photometric redshift estimate. In
Figure 3, we show that this works well for our sample using the catalog from Muzzin et al. (2013a).
This suggests that the sample studied in this paper is representative of the selection we presented
in Section 2. However, the photometry is used to
select red systems and, consequently, introduce a
selection bias towards mergers between red galaxies. An unresolved merger of a quiescent galaxy
with a star-forming galaxy would produce a resulting bluer system that might be excluded from
the selection.
7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We examined the largest sample of massive quiescent
galaxies observed to date at z > 2 with deep X-shooter
spectroscopy and HST/WFC3 imaging. We extend previous searches for very massive quiescent galaxies at
z > 2 to the K-band brightest UVJ quiescent galaxies
in COSMOS (Muzzin et al. 2013a), constructing a sample of 15 MQGs. Full SED modeling of the photometry
and spectroscopy confirms the sample to be ∼ 1.5 Gyr
old, massive, log10 (M∗ /M ) > 11, quiescent galaxies.
3 out of 15 galaxies are confirmed as ongoing major
merger using both imaging and spectroscopy. In total,
40 % of the sample show evidence of mergers (minor or
major) or other disturbed morphologies in HST/WFC3
HF 160W imaging, suggestive of ongoing morphological
transformation. The morphological information is used
to correct the stellar masses prior to comparing the stellar populations, kinematics and structure/morphology
of the galaxies to the MASSIVE(n) sample. We list
below the main conclusions of the paper:

• We find that our galaxies lie 1 − 1.5 dex below the
extrapolation at the high stellar mass end of the
SFR main-sequence (Speagle et al. 2014) at z = 2
and can be considered quiescent with low specific

23

SFR, log10 (sSFR/yr) < −10.5. These limits are
based on optical emission line and MIR emission
limits and detections. 1/3 of the galaxies are detected in the MIR which could be caused by residual SF. However, more than half of our sample
(60 % of the MIR detections) have radio emission
detected at 1.4 or 3 GHz. This radio emission is
likely associated with AGN activity, a proposed
heating mechanism leading to quenching and/or
the maintenance of quiescence in massive galaxies.
• We find indirect evidence pointing to our velocity
dispersion measurements to be minimally contaminated by rotation. Our systems also have a Sérsic
index n > 2.5 (see Section 5.2). A direct comparison between our study and the MASSIVE(n)
sample, shows evidence for shallow or no velocity
dispersion evolution from z = 2 − 0.
• Our sample is compact, in line with previous studies at z ∼ 2 (van der Wel et al. 2014; Mowla et al.
2018). We find that the median mass-size evolution (∆r ∝ ∆M∗α ) compared to the MASSIVE(n)
sample is best described by α = 1.78+0.37
−0.29 . This is
consistent with both the simple kinematic predictions of minor merger driven size evolution from
Bezanson et al. (2009) and the more extensive numerical treatment from Hilz et al. (2012).
• We find that our sample of z > 2 MQGs is
consistent with a dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio
M∗ /Mdyn < 1 but that the shallow dispersion
and significant size increase lead to an increasing dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio, doubling from
z = 2 to the present day. Such an effect is shown
to be reproduced for an increasing dark matter
fraction from z = 2 − 0, within the effective radius
of the galaxy (Hilz et al. 2012).
In this paper the largest sample of MQGs at z > 2
with kinematic and structural observations, found via
the mass-size and dynamical-stellar mass plane, is presented. A fixed CND-matching suggests that our sample of galaxies are the progenitors of the most massive
and oldest elliptical galaxies in the local Universe, thus
connecting 10 billion years of evolution. These galaxies
show a broad range of disturbed morphologies, confirming that mergers play a significant role in their morphological transformation and evolution to z = 0.
In a companion paper, the relationship between the
size and dispersion will be explored by studying the
Fundamental Plane at z ∼ 2 and its consequent evolution to the present-day Universe (Stockmann+19b in

APPENDIX
A. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE REDUCTION OF THE IMAGES

A.1. PSF & astrometry
The HF 160W images from our program and the ancillary COSMOS F 814W images employed in this work do not
share the same World Coordinate System (WCS). We need to guarantee that the astrometry is common and accurate in
both bands. Therefore, we chose to align the images to the COSMOS ACS F 814W image as the reference frame, which
is registered to the fundamental astrometric frame of the COSMOS field, ensuring an absolute astrometric accuracy
of 0.00 05–0.00 1 or better. Following Gómez-Guijarro et al. (2018), we use TweakReg along with SExtractor (Bertin &
Arnouts 1996) catalogs of the two bands with the F 814W catalog and frame as references to register the images. After
this, the images in both bands are resampled to a common grid and a pixel scale of 0.00 06 pix−1 using SWarp (Bertin
et al. 2002). In addition, the spatial resolution of the two HST bands is also different. Following Gómez-Guijarro et al.
(2018), we degrade the F 814W to the resolution of the F 160W data (0.00 18 FWHM). We calculate the kernel to match
the ACS F 814W to the PSF in the F 160W images employing the task PSFMATCH in IRAF, including a cosine bell
function tapered in frequency space to avoid introducing artifacts in the resulting kernel from the highest frequencies.
Then, we convolve this kernel to the F 814W image to achieve a common spatial resolution.
A.2. Modeling of foreground and background sources
Based on the spatially offset emission in the 2-D X-shooter spectra, we determine if candidate sources are within close
proximity to the central galaxy. In Figure 5 the central sources along their spatially offset sources is shown. UV-171687
shows offset Hα and [NII] emission arising from a south-western source that we establish to be a foreground galaxy at
z = 1.51. We find another foreground galaxy north-east of UV-171060 at z = 1.37 based on assuming that the single
emission line detection is Hα. North-east of UV-155853 we find a background galaxy at z = 2.36 (best visible in the

Galfit modeling residuals of Figure 5) determined from the [OIII] doublet at 4959, 5007 Å. For UV-105842 we find two
spatially offset source, 1) ∼ 300 north-east and 2) ∼ 100 north-east. Source 1) is a foreground galaxy at z = 0.44 based
on the detected strong O[III] doublet at 4959, 5007 Å and Hα emission. For source 2) we find the [OII] doublet at
3726.2, 3728.9 Å, O[III] doublet at 4959, 5007 Å, and Hα corresponding to a redshift z = 2.0124. The latter redshift
corresponds to a velocity offset of 2130 ± 120 km/s (uncertainty is calculated based on the spread of the individual
redshift measurements) suggesting that it is not gravitationally bound to the central galaxy. Another option could be
an offset AGN with high peculiar velocity following a merger.
B. DETAILS ON MODELING OF THE VELOCITY DISPERSION

B.1. Statistical and systematic uncertainties
To estimate the statistical error we measure the spread of the velocity dispersion distribution obtained from running
pPXF on a 1000 data realizations. The data realizations are made by perturbing the pPXF best fit model with the
pipeline estimated error spectrum, by linearly drawing values from a Gaussian with a mean of zero and spread of the
initial errors. The X-shooter pipeline-estimated noise map is subjected to a wavelength dependent correlation of the
pixels. We take this effect into account by scaling our noise spectrum to a reduced χ2red = 1 (assuming the errors
are Gaussian). We follow the method used in Toft et al. (2017) and fit a 2nd
q order polynomial to a 50 pixel running

reduced χ2 that we use to make a correction noise map, σχ2corr = σχ2original χ2f it .
We estimate the systematic error by testing how the dispersion is changing with the correction polynomial and
implemented wavelength range. We construct a grid of correction polynomials up to 24th order of both additive
and multiplicative polynomials, where we find an average of 20 % variation from the fiducial dispersion, except for
UV-239220, UV-773654, UV-171060, and CP-1291751. When varying the start wavelength range ([λstart , λend ]) within
the interval [3750 − 4050, 5950] and the end wavelength within the interval [3750, 4050 − 5950], we find that overall the
dispersions are stable. In a few cases, the velocity dispersion increases well above the median dispersion (with varying
wavelengths) with 50−100 % when excluding the higher order Balmer and Ca H+K lines, highlighting their importance.
When including the end wavelength λ > 4500 we find more stable dispersion measurements, not surprising as otherwise
only half of the spectrum is included. The low S/N cases have more unstable dispersion values when excluding wavelength areas, highlighting the importance of understanding the systematic uncertainties. We sum up the wavelength
and polynomial test by confirming that our fiducial velocity dispersions are robust (except for UV-239220, UV-773654,
UV-171060, and CP-1291751). The systematic error is primarily due to template mismatch and as a result, we estimate the systematic error from the minimum and maximum values of the dispersion when using the full wavelength
range and varying the additive and multiplicative correction polynomials, σsys = 2/3 · (σmax − σmin )/2. This method
is subjected to catastrophic outliers, and prior to the systematic error estimate, we exclude dispersion values more
than 5σ outside of a Gaussian mean. We find that the systematic errors are on the order of the statistical uncertainties.
B.1.1. Additional tests
We measure the dispersion while excluding a window of 1600 km/s along the wavelength direction in steps of 5 Å, to
test whether the measured dispersion is dominated by specific lines. We find that the fiducial dispersion is very stable
against excluding individual lines, and did not find a consistent decrease in the velocity dispersion similar to previous
studies when excluding the Hβ line (van de Sande et al. 2013; Toft et al. 2017). We allow pPXF to construct a linear
combination of templates from the stellar library of BC03 with a Chabrier IMF and solar metallicity and find similar
redshifts and velocity dispersions as our fiducial values which are reassuring.
C. DETAILS ON THE EMISSION LINE FITTING

For UV-108899, we find that when fitting a double Gaussian profile to [OII] (3726 + 3729 Å) fixed to the redshift of
the central galaxy, gives the most conservative (highest) flux estimate. We try fitting with a single profile while using
a free redshift parameter but recover high χ2 solutions. We list this conservative flux estimate, corresponding to a
SFR = 6 ± 4 M /yr (Kennicutt 1998), in Table. 2.
For UV-239220, we detect excess emission in the region of Hα and the [NII] (6548 + 6583 Å) doublet. With a fixed
ratio between the [NII] doublet, we try three types of triple Gaussian profile models (free redshift+dispersion limit
of 250 km/s, free redshift+dispersion limit of 1000 km/s, and fixed redshift+dispersion limit of 1000 km/s) that all
result in χ2 > 2.4 with no preferred solution. If we assign all of the flux in the excess to Hα we obtain a conservative

26

Stockmann et al

Kennicutt (1998) SFR upper limit of ∼ 30 M /yr (log(sSF R) < −10 [yr−1 ]) consistent with the FIR and rest-frame
optical upper limits from Section 4.4.1. This confirms that the galaxy has low specific star formation consistent with
its selection.
D. COMPARING DIFFERENT CND METHODS

The MASSIVE(n) sample was established using the assumption of a fixed CND from z = 2 to 0. To show that
our results are robust against the choice of CND matching method we show the three result figures from Section 5 in
Figure 10 using both the fixed CND matching and the probabilistic approach presented in Wellons & Torrey (2017).
The probabilistic approach uses numerical simulations (e.g. Illustris) to estimate the probability that a galaxy at
z = 0 are the descendant of a galaxy at redshift, zobs . This method therefore allows to predict the most probable CND
at z = 0 for a population of galaxies with the specific CND at z = 2 following the evolution of a numerical simulation.
This method is thus a different approach than the fixed CND approach and in Figure 10 we show that adopting these
two methods of connecting galaxies across time leads to the same conclusions.
