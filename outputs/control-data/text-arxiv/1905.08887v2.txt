Abstract. We consider a class of second-order partial differential operators A of Hörmander
type, which contain as a prototypical example a well-studied operator introduced by Kolmogorov
in the ’30s. We analyze some properties of the nonlocal operators driven by the fractional powers
of A , and we introduce some interpolation spaces related to them. We also establish sharp
pointwise estimates of Harnack type for the semigroup associated with the extension operator.
Moreover, we prove both global and localised versions of Poincaré inequalities adapted to the
underlying geometry.

1. Introduction
In our recent works [24], [25] we have developed a fractional calculus, and established nonlocal

partial differential equations of evolution type
(1.1)

K u = A u − ∂t u = 0,

with diffusive part in the form
(1.2)

A u = tr(Q∇2 u)+ < BX, ∇u > .

FUNCTIONAL INEQUALITIES ETC.

Here, we have denoted by X the variable in RN (N ≥ 2), whereas Q and B indicate two given
N × N matrices with real constant coefficients. For a N × N matrix A the notation tr A indicates
the trace of A, A∗ the transpose of A, ∇2 u the Hessian matrix of u.
The aim of the present note is to complement the above cited works, as well as our work in
preparation [26], and also establish two results of independent interest. We remark that when
Q = IN and B = ON in (1.2), then A = ∆ and (1.1) gives that K = ∆ − ∂t is the standard
heat operator in RN +1 . Although we will at times refer to this classical non-degenerate case
for comparison or illustrative purposes, our primary focus is the genuinely degenerate setting
in which Q = Q∗ ≥ 0, and B 6= ON . In such framework, the class (1.1) encompasses various
evolution equations of interest in mathematics and physics.
Perhaps the best known example dates back to Kolmogorov’s 1934 note [33] on Brownian
motion and the theory of gases, and it is given by
K0 u = ∆v u+ < v, ∇x u > −∂t u = 0,

where now N = 2n, X = (v, x), with v, x ∈ Rn . Other examples of degenerate equations
in the form (1.1) of interest in physics were studied in [15]. We emphasise that the operator
K0 badly fails to be parabolic since it is missing the diffusive term ∆x u. Nonetheless, it is
hypoelliptic. This remarkable fact was proved by Kolmogorov himself, who found the following
explicit fundamental solution
 1

cn
p0 (X, Y, t) = 2n exp − |v − w|2 + < v − w, y − x − tv > + 2 |x − y + tv|2 ,
t

where Y = (w, y). Since p0 (X, Y, t) is obviously smooth off the diagonal, the hypoellipticity of
K0 follows. For the probabilistic meaning of p0 (X, Y, t) we refer the reader to the insightful note
of D. Stroock [50], from which we now quote: “Kolmogorov’s example stood in isolation until
1967, when Hörmander [29] proved a general theorem that put it in context”.
The result referred to in this quote is the celebrated hypoellipticity theorem. Specialised to the
class (1.1) such result states that K is hypoelliptic if and only if for every t > 0 the covariance
matrix is invertible, i.e.,
Z t
⋆
def 1
(1.3)
K(t) =
esB QesB ds > 0.
t 0
It is well-known that (1.3) is equivalent to Hörmander’s famous finite rank condition for the
operators (1.1) and (1.2), see [29], but also [55, 30, 34, 37, 40].
One notable feature of the class (1.1) is that the fundamental solution of K (i.e., the transition
probability kernel of A ) is explicit, see [29]. This fact has been extensively used, for example, for
interior and boundary regularity issues in [48, 23, 37, 46, 41, 32, 2]. In the recent works [25, 26]
such fundamental solution was expressed in the following suggestive form

for the non-symmetric intertwined pseudo-distance, and
(1.6)

Bt (X, r) = {Y ∈ RN | mt (X, Y ) < r},

for the corresponding time-dependent pseudo-balls. Also, we have indicated with
√
(1.7)
V (t) = VolN (Bt (X, t)) = ωN (det(tK(t)))1/2
the volume function. By the expression (1.4) it should be apparent that such function is bound
to play an important role in the analysis of (1.1). The reader should note that the right-hand
Lie group structure
side of (1.7) is independent of the point X ∈ RN . This reflect the underlying
R
first noted in [37]. It was shown in [29] that for f ∈ S (RN ), u(X, t) = RN p(X, Y, t)f (Y )dY is
the unique solution of the Cauchy problem K u = 0 in RN × (0, ∞), u(X, 0) = f (X). Moreover,
the formula
Z
p(X, Y, t)f (Y )dY,
(1.8)
Pt f (X) = e−tA f (X) =
RN

defines a strongly-continuous semigroup {Pt }t>0 in every Lp (RN ), 1 ≤ p < ∞, with infinitesimal
generator −A . The same is true for p = ∞, if we agree (as we will, henceforth) to replace
N
N
L∞ (RN ) with the Banach space L∞
0 (R ) of those f ∈ C(R ) such that lim |f (X)| = 0 with
N
L∞
0 (R ),

|X|→∞

the norm || · ||∞ . In fact, Pt is contractive on
but it is not so, in general, on Lp (RN ),
when p < ∞. For a summary of the main known properties of the semigroup (1.8), we refer the
reader to see [24, Section 2] and the bibliography therein.
Despite its apparent similarity with the classical Euclidean heat kernel, formula (1.4) hides
a greater complexity. One aspect of this is the
√ dependence of both the intertwined pseudot), on the time variable t. Another difficulty is
distance mt (X, Y ), and the pseudo-balls Bt (X,
√
the drastically different geometry of Bt (X, t) depending on the eigenvalues of the matrix B.
In this connection, we recall that in [25, Section 3] we showed the Lp − L∞ ultracontractivity of
the semigroup. Precisely, for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ one has for f ∈ Lp (RN ),
cN,p
||f ||p ,
(1.9)
|Pt f (X)| ≤
V (t)1/p
for a certain constant cN,p > 0. The unfamiliar reader should be aware that in the general
framework of (1.1), (1.2) this property, per se, does not necessarily imply a decay rate of the
semigroup. For instance, when Q = IN and B = −IN , then the operator in (1.1) becomes
K = ∆u− < X, ∇u > −∂t u, the classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. In such case one can
see that V (t) → cN > 0 as t → ∞. One of the main ideas in [25] was to combine (1.9) with the
assumption
(1.10)

tr B ≥ 0.

Not only (1.10) guarantees that Pt be contractive in Lp (RN ) for 1 ≤ p < ∞, see (2.9), but such
assumption also determines the large time behaviour of the volume function V (t). In fact, it
was shown in [25, Prop. 3.1] that (1.10) implies that V (t) blows up at least linearly at infinity.
Furthermore, if at least one of the eigenvalues of B has a positive real part, then V (t) blows up
exponentially. In all cases, when (1.10) holds we obtain from (1.9) that Pt f (X) → 0 as t → ∞.

FUNCTIONAL INEQUALITIES ETC.

This information played a key role in our proofs of the nonlocal Sobolev and isoperimetric
inequalities in [25], [26]. For instance, in establishing the fundamental identity
(1.11)

f = Iα ◦ (−A )α/2 f = (−A )α/2 ◦ Iα f,

0 < α < 2,

which shows that Iα = (−A )−α/2 . In (1.11) we have let (−A )s denote the nonlocal operator
in (2.8), whereas we have indicated with
Z ∞
1
tα/2−1 Pt f (X)dt,
Iα f (X) =
Γ(α/2) 0
the potential operators of order α. While we refer to [25, 26] for the relevant results, in view of
their applications it is of interest to further analyse the properties of the nonlocal operators in
[24].
This leads us to briefly discuss the main results in this paper. In Section 2 we recall the
definition of (−A )s following the classical approach by Balakrishnan, and we show some notable
properties both of (−A )s and an extension of (1.9). In Section 3 we introduce a class of hypoelliptic Besov spaces related to A . We study the mapping properties of the fractional powers
(−A )s from these Besov spaces into Lp -spaces, with special attention to indicator functions.
This latter aspect becomes relevant in connection with the nonlocal isoperimetric inequalities in
[26]. In Section 4 we discuss two new Poincaré inequalities adapted to the underlying geometry
of the operators in (1.2). In Proposition 4.1 we prove a global Poincaré inequality with respect
to the Gaussian kernel in (1.4). In Corollary 4.2 we establish a localised one on the intertwined
pseudoballs in (1.6). In this latter result the order of differentiation is suitably weighted by the
covariance matrix K(t) in (1.3). Finally, in Section 5 we provide a sharp Harnack inequality for
the semigroup of the extension operator associated with K , see Theorem 5.4. Such estimate is
deduced from an inequality of Li-Yau type established in Lemma 5.3.
2. Fractional powers of A and ultracontractivity
In this section we recall some results from Balakrishnan’s seminal papers [6, 7], with the
purpose of connecting them to our work [24]. We also establish a Lp − Lq ultracontractive
estimate which extends that in [25], and a new representation of the fractional powers (−A )s
using the Poisson kernel in [24, 25].
2.1. The fractional calculus of Balakrishnan. To provide a motivation for the definition of
the fractional powers, we recall some of the pioneering ideas of Balakrishnan. In his work [7] he
considered a closed linear operator A with domain and range in a Banach space X. He assumed
that every λ > 0 belongs to the resolvent set ρ(A), and that with R(λ, A) = (λI − A)−1 , one has
for λ > 0,
(2.1)

λ||R(λ, A)|| ≤ M.

Balakrishnan himself pointed out that this assumption does not necessarily imply that A be the
generator of a semigroup on X. Under the hypothesis (2.1) he defined in formula (2.1) in [7] a

linear operator J α : D(A) ⊂ X → X by the formula
Z
sin(πα) ∞ α−1

λ
R(λ, A)(−A)x dλ,
(2.2)
J x=

0 < ℜα < 1.

If we write the integral in the right-hand side of (2.2) as
Z ∞
Z 1
λα−1 R(λ, A)(−A)xdλ,
λα−1 R(λ, A)(−A)xdλ +

one immediately recognises that both integrals are convergent (in the sense of Bochner). The
former does since ℜα > 0, the latter converges since one has ||λα−1 R(λ, A)(−A)x|| ≤ Cλℜα−2
on [1, ∞) thanks to (2.1), and thus convergence is guaranteed by the hypothesis ℜα < 1. On
p.421-22, Balakrishnan observed that: “If A does generate a semigroup, these coincide with
the previous definitions in [6]”. Let us provide a proof of this statement for the benefit of the
unfamiliar reader. Suppose, in addition to (2.1), that A be the infinitesimal generator of a
strongly continuous semigroup {T (t)}t>0 on X. Then, formula [6, (6.10) in Theor. 6.3] gives for
x ∈ D(A),

s
(T (t)x − x)dt,
0 < ℜα < 1.
(2.3)
Aα x = −
1+α
Γ(1 − s) 0 t
On the other hand, by the well-known
R ∞integral representation of the resolvent, see e.g. [18, (i)
in Theor. 1.10], we have R(λ, A)x = 0 e−λt T (t)x dt. We can thus rewrite (2.2) as follows

where in the second equality we have used the fact that AT (t)x = T (t)Ax for every x ∈ D(A).

We note that in the above integration by parts the boundary terms at 0 and ∞ vanish since for
any x ∈ D(A) we have ||T (t)x − x|| = O(t) as t → 0+ , and ||t−α [T (t)x − x]|| ≤ Ct−ℜα as t → ∞
(we note that by the theorem of Hille-Yosida the assumption (2.1) implies that ||T (t)|| ≤ M for
every t > 0). Substituting the latter identity in (2.5) we find

Keeping the identity Γ(α)Γ(1 − α) = sinππα in mind (see e.g. [53, 3.123 on p.105]), we finally
reach the conclusion that J α x = Aα x, for every x ∈ D(A), which proves Balakrishnan’s comment.

6

FUNCTIONAL INEQUALITIES ETC.

Summarizing, we have shown that when A satisfies (2.1) and it is the infinitesimal generator of
a strongly continuous semigroup {T (t)}t>0 on X, then for 0 < ℜα < 1 one has

As an illustration of (2.6) (and, in fact, this example was the main motivation behind Balakrishnan’s formula (2.3)), consider the standard heat semigroup e−t∆ in RN , with generator
N

A = −∆. If we denote by p(X, Y,

) the heat kernel, then for any
4t
R
f ∈ S (RN ) one has e−t∆ f (X) = RN p(X, Y, t)f (Y )dY . If we insert this information in (2.3),
and we exchange the order of integration, we find

see also [38], and the survey articles [11], [35], [21], [1].

2.2. The fractional powers (−A )s . After these preliminaries we return to the semigroup
(1.8). It was shown in [24] that, under the assumption (1.10) such semigroup possesses all the
properties which are needed to the implementation of Balakrishnan’s fractional calculus. We
recall here the definition of the nonlocal operators (−A )s given in [24, Definition 3.1].
Definition 2.1. Let 0 < s < 1. For any f ∈ S (RN ) we define for X ∈ RN ,
Z ∞
s
s
(−A ) f (X) = −
(2.8)
t−(1+s) [Pt f (X) − f (X)] dt.
Γ(1 − s) 0

The previous definition makes a pointwise sense for any drift matrix B, and it makes sense
also in Lp for any p ∈ [1, +∞] if B satisfies (1.10). We next collect some known basic properties
of the nonlocal operators (2.8), see [7, Lemmas 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5]. In the next result, when we
write D(A ) we mean the domain of the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup Pt over the
N
Banach space L∞
0 (R ).
Proposition 2.2. The following properties hold:

7

(i) for any f ∈ D(A ) such that A f ∈ D(A ), one has lim (−A )s f = −A f ;
s→1−

(ii) for any f ∈ D(A ) such that λR(λ, A ) → 0 as λ → 0+ , one has lim (−A )s f = −f ;
(iii) let

s, s′

∈ (0, 1) and suppose that s

+ s′

s→0+

∈ (0, 1]. Then, for any f ∈ D(A 2 ) one has
′

(−A )s+s f = (−A )s ◦ (A )s f.

2.3. Ultracontractivity. The role of the number tr B in the spectral properties of the semigroup {Pt }t>0 can be seen in the following estimate valid for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, and any t > 0 (see,
e.g, [24, Lemma 2.4, (iv)]),
||Pt ||Lp (RN )→Lp (RN ) ≤ e−t

(2.9)

.

Moreover, we proved in [25, Proposition 3.5] that for any 1 ≤ p < ∞ the following Lp → L∞
ultracontractivity holds
cN,p
(2.10)
||Pt ||Lp (RN )→L∞ (RN ) ≤
1 ,
V (t) p
for a certain constant cN,p > 0. In the next proposition we generalise formulas (2.9)-(2.10) by
establishing the following Lp → Lq ultracontractivity of the semigroup {Pt }t>0 .

Proposition 2.3. For every 1 ≤ p < ∞ and q ≥ p, we have Pt : Lp (RN ) → Lq (RN ) for any
t > 0, with

3. Interpolation spaces and fractional powers of A
In this section we introduce a class of hypoelliptic Besov spaces which are tailored on the
operator A . By this we mean that, as we show in Proposition 3.3 below, for every p ≥ 1 the
fractional powers (−A )s continuously map the Besov space B p,α(RN ) into Lp (RN ), provided that
α > 2s and that (1.10) hold. We then turn our attention to the Besov seminorm of indicator
functions, which is relevant for the theory of nonlocal perimeters developed in [26].
To motivate our definition we recall the classical Sobolev-Besov spaces, see e.g. [31], the
monograph [16] and the references therein. When α > 0 and 1 ≤ p < ∞ the space Bαp (RN ) =
Bαp,p(RN ) is the collection of all functions f ∈ Lp (RN ) such that the seminorm

Seminorms of this sort were considered by Slobedetzky [45], Aronszajn [5] and Gagliardo [20].
Using (2.7) with 2s = αp, with the aid of the classical heat kernel p(X, Y, t), we can express the
∆ (f ) < ∞ in the alternative form

Keeping in mind that e−t∆ f (X) = RN p(X, Y, t)f (Y )dY , we see that (3.2) can be equivalently

Concerning (3.3), we recall that the first mathematician to introduce a characterisation of the
Besov spaces via the Poisson or the Gauss-Weierstrass kernels was M. Taibleson in his seminal
work [51], see also [52].
Having observed (3.2) and (3.3) for the classical case, we now return to the setting of (1.2)
and use the semigroup (1.8) to introduce the relevant definition.

Definition 3.1. For p ≥ 1 and α ≥ 0, we define the Besov space B p,α RN as the collection of
those functions f ∈ Lp (RN ), such that the seminorm

The following result establishes the mapping properties of the fractional powers of A from a
Besov space B p,α(RN ) into Lp (RN ) (in this respect, see also [25, Lemma 4.3]).

3.1. Besov spaces and indicator functions. We now take a closer look at the cases p = 1 and
p = 2 of Definition 3.1, with particular attention to indicator functions f = 1E of measurable
sets E ⊂ RN . For any 1 ≤ p < ∞ and 0 < s < 1 we denote by
Dp,s = {f ∈ Lp (RN ) : (−A )s f ∈ Lp (RN )},

the domain of (−A )s in Lp (RN ). Throughout this section, we use the notation C(s) =

The next result provides a basic characterisation, in terms of the Besov spaces B p,α RN , for
membership of an indicator function in the domain of (−A )s in L1 (RN ). We stress that the
next proposition is not true for general functions.
Corollary 3.6. Let E ⊂ RN be measurable. The following are equivalent:

13

FUNCTIONAL INEQUALITIES ETC.

(i) 1E ∈ D1,s ;

(ii) 1E ∈ B 2,s RN ;
(iii) 1E ∈ B 1,2s RN .
Furthermore, when either one of these equivalent statements hold, we have
||(−A )s 1E ||L1 (RN ) = C(s)N2,s (1E )2 = C(s)N1,2s (1E ).

(3.11)

Proof. Proposition 3.4 and (3.9) immediately give (i) =⇒ (ii) ⇐⇒ (iii). To complete the proof
suppose (iii) hold. According to (3.4) this means that 1E ∈ L1 (RN ) and

where in the second equality we have used (3.10). By Remark 3.5 we infer
||(−A )s 1E ||1 = C(s)N1,2s (1E ) < ∞.

This implies that (−A )s 1E ∈ L1 (RN ), hence (i) holds.

At this point it is worth recalling some well-known facts concerning the case p = 2 for the
classical Besov spaces. From (3.1) and Plancherel theorem we have

We mention that the left-hand side of (3.13) is what in their seminal work [12] Caffarelli, Roquejoffre and Savin call the nonlocal perimeter of a measurable set E ⊂ RN . Precisely, for every
0 < s < 1/2 the s-perimeter of E is

where in the second equality we have used (3.11).
Remark 3.7. To understand the limitation 0 < s < 1/2, we stress that if E is a non-empty
open set E, such that |E| < ∞, then in view of (3.13), (3.14), we have
Z
s/2
|ξ|2s |1̂E (ξ)|2 dξ < ∞.

To now see why the condition Ps (E) < ∞ imposes the restriction 0 < s < 1/2, consider e.g. the
unit ball B = {x ∈ RN | |X| < 1}. Using Bochner’s formula

see [28, 6.561, 5., p.683], we find 1̂B (ξ) = |ξ|− 2 J N (2π|ξ|), where Jν (z) is the Bessel function of

we see that |ξ|s 1̂B (ξ) ∈ L2 (RN ) if and only if 0 < s < 1/2. More in general, for any non-empty
open set E ⊂ RN , one has (−∆)s/2 1E 6∈ L2 (RN ) for s = 1/2, see [49, Lemma 3.2].
4. A Poincaré inequality in Gaussian space

see [4]. His proof was based on the Harnack inequality for parabolic equations which had been
recently established by J. Moser in [42], [43]. In their work [19] Fabes and Stroock’s gave a
beautiful rendition of the groundbreaking 1958 ideas of Nash in [44]. In their approach the

15

FUNCTIONAL INEQUALITIES ETC.

above Gaussian lower bound was obtained independently from the Harnack inequality. One
crucial tool was the following Poincaré inequality with respect to the Gaussian measure that had
already played a key role in Nash’ seminal work: for every f ∈ S(Rn ) one has

In (4.1) we have denoted
R by dµ(x) = (4π) 2 e 4 dx the normalised Gaussian measure in R ,
and we have let af = Rn f dµ.
The objective of this section is to prove the following generalisation of the inequality (4.1),
when Gaussian measure is replaced by the transition density kernel p(X, Y, t) in (1.8).

Proposition 4.1 (Generalised Nash inequality). Let f ∈ S (RN ). For all X ∈ RN and t > 0,
we have
Z

< K(t)∇f (Y ), ∇f (Y ) > p(X, Y, t) dY .
|f (Y ) − Pt f (X)|2 p(X, Y, t) dY ≤ 2t

RN

The proof of this result is deferred to subsection 4.2. It should be obvious to the reader that,
if we let A = ∆ in (1.1), then from (1.3) we see that K(t) ≡ IN , and thus the case t = 1 and
X = 0 of Proposition 4.1 is exactly the inequality of Nash (4.1).
Interestingly, Proposition 4.1 implies the following localised Poincaré inequality on the intertwined pseudo-balls Br2 (X, r) in (1.6), see
R also (1.5). For a given function f and a measurable
N
−1
set E ⊂ R , we indicate with fE = |E|
E f (Y )dY the average of f on E. For ease of notation,
in the following statement we let fr = fBr2 (X,r) .
Corollary 4.2. Let r > 0, X ∈ RN , and f ∈ C0∞ (B4r2 (X, 2r)). Then, with C = 2e1/4 , one has

|f (Y ) − fr |2 dY ≤ Cr 2

(1.6) that Br2 (X, r) = {Y ∈ RN | |Y − X| < r} is the standard Euclidean ball B(X, r). In such
situation, Corollary 4.2 is nothing but the following form of the classical Poincaré inequality for

∇X p(X, Y, τ ) = −eτ B ∇Y p(X, Y, τ )

We mention that, in the special case of the Kolmogorov operator ∆v + < v, ∇x > −∂t in
R2n+1 , a more indirect proof of Lemma 4.4 can be found in [9, Proposition 2.5]. There, the
authors perform a suitable perturbation of a carré du champ related to the operator.

This proves (4.2), thus completing the proof.

We close this section by noting that a full-strength analogue of the classical Poincaré inequality
for the operator A seems to be presently missing. In this respect, we mention the work [54],
where the authors prove localised Poincaré inequalities for subsolutions of a class of divergence
form equations with bounded measurable coefficients as in (4.3) below. In their recent work [3]
the authors establish a Poincaré inequality on unbounded cylinders in suitable mixed SobolevGaussian spaces adapted to the special operator A = ∆v − < v, ∇v > + < v, ∇x > in Rn × Rn .
We also mention that in [27] the authors obtain a Moser-type Harnack inequality for nonnegative
solutions to
(4.3)

divv (A(v, x, t)∇v u) + < v, ∇x u > −∂t u = 0,

where (v, x, t) ∈ Rn × Rn × R. The matrix A(·) is uniformly positive definite with bounded measurable entries. Their method does not make use of adapted versions of the Poincaré inequality.
Exploiting the Harnack inequality in [27], in [36] the authors prove a Gaussian lower bound of
Aronson type (see also [17], and references therein, for Gaussian lower bounds for equations with
Hölder coefficients).
5. A sharp Harnack inequality for the extended equation
In their celebrated work [39] Li and Yau proved (among other things) that if f > 0 is a solution
of the heat equation ∂t f − ∆f = 0 on a boundaryless, complete n-dimensional Riemannan

Such inequality becomes an equality when f is the heat kernel in flat Rn . The relevance of (5.1)

In Theorem 5.4 below we are going to establish a global Harnack estimate for Pt ϕ, with
(a)
ϕ ≥ 0. The key step is a remarkable Li-Yau type inequality satisfied by the semigroup {Pt }t>0 ,
see Lemma 5.3 below. We start with the following preliminary lemma, where we compute the
derivative of the function V (t) in (1.7). We denote

Proof. From the relation tK(t) = etB C(t)etB we deduce that for every t > 0,
det (tK(t)) = e2t tr(B) det (C(t)) ,

which easily implies the second equality in (5.6). Concerning the first equality, we recall the
formula
d
(det(M (t))) = tr(M ′ (t)M −1 (t)) det(M (t)),
dt
which holds true for any symmetric invertible matrix M (t), and gives
(5.7)

(log (det (C(t)))) = tr(C ′ (t)C −1 (t)).

On the other hand, from the definition (5.4), we obtain C ′ (t) = e−tB Qe−tB . We also know (see
e.g. [2, equation (4.6)]) that

e−tB Qe−tB = Q − BC(t) − C(t)B ∗ .

The following two lemmas are the crucial Li-Yau type estimates respectively for the Neumann

Lemma 5.2. For any X, Y ∈ RN , z, ζ > 0, t > τ , we denote
