Abstract
We have fabricated arrays of High-Tc Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) with
randomly distributed loop sizes as sensitive detectors for Radio-Frequency (RF) waves.

These sub-

wavelength size devices known as Superconducting Quantum Interference Filters (SQIFs) detect the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field. We used a scalable ion irradiation technique to pattern the
circuits and engineer the Josephson junctions needed to make SQUIDs. Here we report on a 300 SQUIDs
series array with loops area ranging from 6 to 60 µ m2 , folded in a meander line covering a 3.5 mm×120 µ m
substrate area, made out of a 150 nm thick YBa2 Cu3 O7 (YBCO) film. Operating at a temperature T = 66 K
in an un-shielded magnetic environment, under low DC bias current (I = 60 µ A) and DC magnetic field
(B = 3 µ T), this SQIF can detect a magnetic field of a few pT at a frequency of 1.125 GHz, which corre√
sponds to a sensitivity of a few hundreds of fT/ Hz, and shows linear response over 7 decades in RF power.
This work is a promising approach for the realization of low dissipative sub-wavelength GHz magnetometers.

Detecting electromagnetic fields in the micro-wave domain with high precision and resolution is a pivotal issue for both basic science and applications. For instance in solid state studies,
highly sensitive magnetometers are needed to detect electromagnetic fields in quantum information
systems[1], to study electron spin dynamics[2] or to make advanced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
spectroscopy [3]. At the same time, further progress in security systems, wireless and satellite
communications or radars requires significant improvement of state of the art Radio Frequency
(RF) detectors[4].
While most of the electromagnetic wave detectors are based on a resonant electrical dipole for
enhanced sensitivity, the need of sub-wavelength devices is increasing, to miniaturize the detectors and include them in compact and mobile ensembles, or to image electromagnetic fields at
small scale[5–7]. Such lumped elements are usually broadband[8], which is of high interest for
many applications. One way to fulfill all these requirements (high sensitivity, sub-wavelength size,
broadband operation) is to detect the magnetic component of the wave instead of the electric one
as usual.
The state-of-the-art magnetometers reach their best sensitivity in a narrow band of frequency,
and typically operate at frequencies lower than 10-100 MHz. Magnetic sensitivity in the range of
√
(sometimes sub-) fT/ Hz can be achieved[9–11] using two technologies : atomic magnetometers[12]
and Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs)[13]. While the former are based
on optical transition between magnetic sensitive atomic levels, the latter rely on quantum interferences in a superconducting loop interrupted by Josephson Junctions (JJ). The high and comparable
sensitivities of both systems hold at low frequency and rapidly degrade beyond typically a few
MHz. Using Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, Stark et al reported a sensitivity of
√
√
1 µ T/ Hz at 1.6 GHz[9], while Horsley et al reached 1.8 µ T/ Hz up to 26 GHz with a Rb
√
atomic vapor cell[14] and 130 nT/ Hz at 2.7 GHz with NV centers in diamonds[15].
Limitations for high frequency operation also hold for SQUIDs. Indeed, these devices have
a response which is Φ0 periodic in applied magnetic flux (Φ0 =

h
2e

being the flux quantum). An

external feedback loop is used to operate them in a limited range of magnetic field corresponding to
a single valued response. The dynamics of the feedback electronics limits in practice the SQUIDs
bandwidth to 100 MHz[16] in the best cases, unless a special implementation is used to reach up
to GHz, but in a severely reduced bandwidth[17]. To overcome this drawbacks, Superconducting
Quantum Interference Filters (SQIFs), were developed since the pioneer work of Oppenländer
et al[18]. A SQIF is an array of SQUIDs with incommensurate loops sizes. All the periodic
2

responses of individual SQUIDs cancel, and the voltage response to an applied external magnetic
field is single valued. Thus, the magnetic DC response is highly peaked and symmetric around
zero magnetic field, with an extended linear part[19–22]. As a consequence, there is no need of
feedback electronics, and therefore no limitation in frequency for this reason. A SQIF is therefore
an absolute magnetometer, with an interesting linear range when magnetically polarized around the
maximum slope of the peak, and potentially operating at high frequency. Moreover, such devices
can combine different roles and serve as sub-wavelength antennas and amplifiers for instance
[23]. Based on the well-established technology of niobium-based Josephson Junctions (JJ) and
optimized architectures [23, 24], SQIFs were successfully operated as RF detectors up to 15 GHz
with gain in the 20-25 dB range[25, 26]. High-Tc Superconductors (HTS) have also been used
to make SQIFs[27–30] but the maximum operation frequency reported to date is about 100-200
MHz[31–33]. In the present article, we report on an HTS SQIF operating in the GHz frequency
√
range with a sensitivity in the hundreds of fT/ Hz range.
We have fabricated an HTS SQIF using the ion irradiation technique in a two-step process (details on the fabrication techniques can be found in our previous papers[30, 33–37]). Starting from a
commercial[38] 150 nm thick c-axis oriented YBa2 Cu3 O7 (YBCO) film grown on a sapphire substrate, we first design the superconducting circuit, namely the SQUID rings, their interconnections
and the contact pads : a photoresist mask protects the film from a 110 keV oxygen ion irradiation at
a dose of 5 × 1015 ions/cm2 to keep it superconducting. The unprotected part becomes insulating.
In a second step, an e-beam sensitive resist mask covering the whole film is used, in which trenches
of 40 nm wide and a few microns long have been opened at places where Josephson junctions (JJ)
will be created, namely accross the SQUIDs arms. Another ion irradiation at much lower dose
(3 × 1013 ions/cm2) defines the JJ by lowering locally the superconducting Tc . The SQIF used in
this study is made of 300 SQUIDs in series, with loop sizes randomly distributed between 6 and
60 µ m2 folded in a meander line (see Figure 1 (a)). The width of the SQUIDs arms is 2 µ m in the
vicinity of the JJs. The total size of the device is 8 mm by 120 µ m. This is much smaller than the
wavelength λ ∼ 30 cm of the RF waves used in this experiment (frequency ∼ 1 GHz). The SQIF
can therefore be considered as a lumped element at such frequencies.
The SQIF is mounted on a Printed-Circuit Board (PCB) with a Co-Planar Wave guide (CPW)
transmission line. It is then placed in a magnetically un-shielded cryogen-free cryostat, equipped
with Helmholtz coils to generate a DC magnetic field, filtered wires to DC bias the device and
coaxial cables for RF measurements. The measurement setup is schematically shown in Figure
3

FIG. 1. (a) Optical picture of the device. SQUIDs are in series in a meander line to make the SQIF (central
part of the picture), which is connected to the CPW (CoPlanar Waveguide) line made of gold covered YBCO
(on the right part of the picture). JJ are indicated by white lines in the blow-up part. The regions colored in
brown are pristine and superconducting. The ones in grey are insulating. The superconducting line around
the SQIF (dashed line texture) is not used in this experiment. (b) Sketch of the measurement set-up. The
RF input signal is sent onto the sample through a circular antenna placed above it. The detected signal is
conveyed through an on-chip CPW line followed by a coaxial cable to the room-temperature amplifier and
the spectrum analyzer. A bias-T is used to DC bias the sample.

1 (b). The input RF signal is generated in a continuous mode at a fixed frequency f and a given
source power PRF , band-filtered at room temperature (in a 400 MHz bandwidth (around 1.17 GHz))
and then coupled to the sample through a circular antenna (5 mm in diameter) placed at about 1
cm from the SQIF surface, i.e. in a near-field condition for ∼ 1 GHz frequency wave in vacuum.
The RF output signal is isolated from DC by a bias-tee at low temperature, pre-amplified at room
temperature (+ 40 dB gain) and measured with a spectrum analyzer in a zero-span mode with a
1-kHz resolution bandwidth. A circulator has been used to prevent the amplifier’s noise to radiate
back onto the sample.
Figure 2 (a) shows the resistance R of the SQIF as a function of temperature T . As reported
previously [30, 34, 37], a Josephson behavior is observed below a coupling temperature TJ =
4

67 K. The normal state resistance measured at T = 80 K is RN = 309 Ω. The Current-Voltage
(IV) characteristic (inset Figure 2 (a)) measured at T = 66 K is typical of ion irradiated YBCO
JJ[30, 36, 39, 40].

I and B at TOPT . Two pronounced extrema can be seen, corresponding to optimal field and current
conditions to detect a DC magnetic field. In the following, we are studying the ability of such a
device to detect the magnetic component of RF waves, and therefore to be used as highly sensitive
sensor in the GHz frequency range.
The device is DC biased with IOPT at TOPT and exposed to RF waves at a frequency of f = 1.125
GHz. The RF power delivered by the source is PRF = 0 dBm. As compared to our previous
measurements[33] where the RF wave was directly coupled on-chip, we are in a situation of weak
RF coupling. Even at the highest input RF power used here (PRF = 10 dBm), neither the I − V
characteristics nor the V (B) one change with PRF within 1%.
The output RF voltage of the SQIF is measured with a spectrum analyzer under a swept DC
magnetic field B. The amplitude of the signal VRF at frequency f is partially modulated by B,
6

which is a clear signature of a SQIF response. In Figure 3 (b) we plot the pure SQIF response[33]
∆VRF = VRF (B) −VRF (B = 0) as a function of B (red squares) at TOPT . In the same graph is shown
the variation of VB (black line), which is a cut of the Figure 3 (a) for IOPT = 60 µ A . The two
curves superimpose with a very good accuracy as expected in a linear regime[33]. Indeed, the
total magnetic field seen by the SQIF is BTOT = B + bRF sin (2π f t), where bRF is the RF magnetic
√
field amplitude, proportional to PRF . For small bRF , one can make a first order Taylor expansion
of the output signal, and VRF ∝ ∂ V /∂ B = VB . This is valid for temperatures corresponding to
the Josephson regime, as shown in Figure 3 (d). The evolutions of VB and ∆VRF (PRF = 0 dBm)
with the bias current I also coincide as shown in Figure 3 (c) at TOPT , in which we have plotted
−
+
∆VRF
= min(∆VRF (B < 0)) and ∆VRF
= max(∆VRF (B > 0)) as a function of I (red symbols) to

account for the relative signs of the magnetic field. On the same graph is shown (black line)
VB− = min(VB (B < 0)) and VB+ = max(VB (B > 0)) as a function of I. This analysis clearly proves
that the SQIF response is at play in the RF detection. Indeed, the evolution of the RF signal closely
follows that of the DC transfer factor under B, I and T changes. This allows us going one step
further and making parametric plots of the data to extract more quantitative information.
In the following, we estimate quantitatively the RF magnetic field sensitivity of the device.
We express the first order Taylor expansion of the voltage for small bRF as follows V (BTOT ) =
V (B) + ∂∂VB bRF sin (2π f t)+CbRF cos (2π f t), where the last term accounts for the regular induction
(non-SQIF response) of the device and C is a constant[33]. The measured VRF at frequency f is the
Fourier amplitude of the linear term, and ∆VRF = ∂ V /∂ B · bRF = VB · bRF . The amplitude of the RF
magnetic field is therefore just the ratio bRF =

∆VRF
VB .

In Figure 4 (a) ∆VRF is plotted as a function

of VB for different bias currents I (solid symbols) and magnetic fields B (open symbols) at TOPT .
The RF input power is PRF = 0 dBm. All the points align on a single straight line (dashed line in
the Figure) as expected for this parametric plot. According to the above expression, the slope of
this line is the RF magnetic field amplitude, which is here bRF = 12 nT ± 2 nT. The uncertainty is
given by the reddish zone in Figure 4 (a). The same parametric plot in B made for different PRF
ranging from −60 dBm to 10 dBm also shows a linear behavior (Figure 4 (b) & (c) ). The slope
√
of these curves, that is bRF , is then plotted as a function of PRF on a log-log scale in Figure 4
(d). The dashed line has a slope of 1 as expected. This shows that the RF measured magnetic field
is proportional to the input one over 7 decades in RF power, and that the minimum field measured
in this series of experiments is of the order of bRF ∼ 10 pT. The sensitivity of this SQIF in the 1
√
kHz bandwidth of the zero-span mode of our analyzer is therefore s ∼ 300 fT/ Hz.

Such numbers are in line with what is expected. The amplitude of the magnetic field produced
in the near-field by an antenna of diameter d on its axis at a distance D is | B |=

µ0 d 2 IRF
,
8D3

where

IRF is the RF current in the antenna[41]. Taking into account the impedance of the antenna at
f = 1.125 GHz (resistance = 1.8 Ω, inductance ×2π f = 50 Ω) and the reflection coefficient
S11 = 0.96 of our set up, we estimate the produced RF magnetic field to be bRF ∼ 25 pT for
PRF = −60 dBm, which is only twice the measured one. This is the maximum field produced by
the emitting antenna, and a more accurate calculation with the exact geometry of the antenna and
the SQIF would give a lower value.
The main targeted applications for SQIFs are sensitive detectors of free space RF waves for
radars, communications or security systems in open environments, for which the noise floor is
typically in the -120 dBm range. The minimum detected signal in conventional devices is therefore
around -110 dBm. We can calculate the average power P corresponding to the minimum RF field
we detected (bRF ∼ 10 pT ), P =

b2RF ε0 c3 Σ
,
2

where ε0 is the air permittivity, c the speed of light and
8

Σ the surface of the detector, ∼ 1 · 10−6 m2 for the present SQIF. We find P ∼ -110 dBm, not far
from the targeted value, with a device much smaller than regular antennas.
The field sensitivity around 1 GHz achieved with this device compares favorably with the best
√
ones using atomic magnetometers which operate at room temperature, in the µ T/ Hz range,
reported by Stark et al[9] and Horsley et al[14] (up to 50 GHz), and more recently down to
√
130pT/ Hz at ∼ 2 GHz[15]. It is worthwhile noticing that this is the highest frequency ever
reported for High-Tc SQIF operation. Moreover, we could observe a SQIF response up to 7.7 GHz
confirming the intrinsic broadband character of the device, but not perform a quantitative analysis of the signal because of poor impedance matching of the whole circuit at this frequency, and
the associated numerous parasitic resonances in the detection system. The latter limit the actual
bandwidth as well, to roughly 30 MHz at 1.125 GHz.
We can compare these results with the only low-Tc SQUIDs arrays which have been successfully operated as RF antennas in the GHz region so far[19, 26]. Authors report on "power gains"
in the range of 5 to 30 dB at frequencies between 9 and 12 GHz mostly, with a bandwidth varying
from ∼ 30 to 300 MHz depending on the configuration. However, what is shown is an ON/OFF
operation. Indeed, a comparison is made on the transmission coefficient S21 when the SQIF is DC
powered (ON), and not powered (OFF). The ratio is measured to be between 5 and 30 dB, and in
fact corresponds to the signal that can be measured, exactly as in our case, and not the true gain of
an active system. In addition, no magnetic field dependence is specifically reported, which is the
proof of SQIF operation.
Better sensitivity can be achieved with our ion-irradiated HTS SQIF, by increasing the transfer
factor VB which is quite low for the device described here (∼ 125 VT−1 ) as compared to our
previous results[30] (∼ 1000 VT−1 ), or to the best results with step-edge HTS JJ of the CSIRO
group VB ∼ 1750 VT−1 [29] and VB ∼ 40 kVT−1 [42] using more complex architectures. A new
design using 2D arrays is under test for enhanced transfer factor. In addition, one can improve the
sensitivity by concentrating the magnetic field. The actual flux focusing factor of the individual
SQUIDs is of the order of 3 in the actual geometry[43], which can be slightly increased. We
can also put large superconducting pads in the vicinity of the SQIF to concentrate the flux even
further[44].
In summary, we have studied the RF properties of a HTS 1D series SQIF array made of ion irradiated JJ, and tested its performance as a sensitive magnetometer in the GHz frequency range, in
an un-shielded magnetic environment. Operating in the 60 − 68 K temperature range, the device
9

showed a SQIF response under DC magnetic field, and could detect RF electromagnetic waves
emitted by a loop antenna up to 7.7 GHz. We evidenced that the applied DC magnetic field
modulates the RF output signal, sign of a SQIF operation, and that the absolute value of the RF
magnetic field can be extracted from the measurement at 1.125 GHz. At optimum conditions,
we have shown that the device can detect an RF magnetic field of about 10 pT at this frequency,
√
corresponding to a sensitivity of ∼ 300 fT/ Hz, in a bandwidth of 30 MHz and with a dynamical range of 70 dB. Such result paves the way of highly sensitive RF magnetometers working at
temperatures where cost- and energy-effective cryo-coolers operate, which are broadband in frequency and sub-wavelength in size. These are three major issues for a wide range of applications
where compact RF antennas are required.
