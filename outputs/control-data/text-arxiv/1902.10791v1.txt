CeRhSi3 is a superconductor under pressure coexisting with a weakly antiferromagnetic phase
characterized by a Bragg peak at ~
q0 =(∼ 0.2, 0, 0.5) (N. Aso et al. J. Magn. Magn. Mater. 310,
602 (2007)). The compound is also a heavy fermion material with a large specific heat coefficient
γ=110 mJ · mol−1 · K−2 and a high Kondo temperature of TK =50 K indicative that CeRhSi3 is
in a strongly Kondo screened state. We apply high resolution neutron spectroscopy to investigate
the magnetic fluctuations in the normal phase, at ambient pressures, and at low temperatures. We
~
measure a commensurate dynamic response centered around the Q=(0,
0, 2) position that gradually evolves to H ∼ 0.2 with decreasing temperature and/or energy transfers. The response is
broadened both in momentum and energy and not reminiscent of sharp spin wave excitations found
in insulating magnets where the electrons are localized. We parameterize the excitation spectrum
and temperature dependence using a heuristic model utilizing the random phase approximation to
couple relaxing Ce3+ ground state Kramers doublets with a Kondo-like dynamic response. With
a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interaction within the ab plane and an increasing single site susceptibility, we can qualitatively reproduce the neutron spectroscopic results
in CeRhSi3 and namely the trade-off between scattering at commensurate and incommensurate
positions. We suggest that the antiferromagnetic phase in CeRhSi3 is driven by weakly correlated
relaxing localized Kramers doublets and that CeRhSi3 at ambient pressures is on the border between a Rudderman-Kittel-Yosida antiferromagnetic state and a Kondo screened phase where static
magnetism is predominately absent.

I.

INTRODUCTION

There are a growing list of heavy fermion based materials that show a balance between unconventional superconductivity and localized magnetism.2,3 In particular,
several Ce3+ compounds, such as CeCoIn5 (Tc =2.3 K),
display similar unconventional superconducting order parameters4,5 to that of cuprate or iron based high temperature superconductors. However, in case of the Ce3+ materials, the energy scale is much more amenable to experimental techniques such as thermal and cold neutron spectroscopy.6–8 These materials therefore provide excellent
model systems to understand the balance between competing electronic and magnetic phases.9,10 We present
neutron inelastic scattering data in the low temperature
ambient and non superconducting phase of CeRhSi3 11 illustrating the competition between commensurate magnetism and incommensurate density wave fluctuations.
CeRhSi3 is a noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion
(space group # 107 I4mm) with a tetragonal unit cell
with lattice parameters a=4.269 Å and c=9.738 Å.12

Magnetic Ce3+ ions are located at the body center and
the unit cell edges. The body center Ce3+ position is surrounded by a layer of Rh above and by a layer of Si below,
therefore breaking inversion symmetry making CeRhSi3
non centrosymmetric (Fig. 1 a). CeRhSi3 has a comparatively high electronic specific heat coefficient of γ=110
mJ · mol−1 · K−2 in comparison to, for example, antiferromagnetic CeCoGe3 with γ=57 mJ · mol−1 · K−2 along
with a large Kondo temperature of TK =50 K.13 Putting
these values together to estimate the RKKY temperature (given by kB TRKKY ∼ 3J 2 γ/π 2 with J estimated
from the specific heat and Kondo temperature with
J = −1/ log(3TK γ/π 2 ))14 gives TRKKY ∼ 300 K. While
TRKKY >TK is indicative of local magnetism15 , the combination of γ and TK is suggestive of a strongly Kondo
screened phase by comparing −1/ log(3kB TK γπ −2 ) to
other Cerium based heavy fermions.14 Furthermore, the
low temperature phase has been studied by both band
structure calculations and quantum oscillation measurements reporting large electron effective mass enhancement factors of m∗ /me ∼ 8.16 Possibly indicative of being

2
on the borderline between itinerant and localized magnetism, CeRhSi3 is weakly antiferromagnetic with a small
ordered magnetic moment ∼ 0.1 µB below temperatures
of TN =1.6 K and was previously characterized by an incommensurate wave vector of (∼0.2, 0, 0.5) investigated
with neutron elastic scattering.1
Under pressures greater than ∼ 12 kbar, CeRhSi3 is
found to be superconducting with a Tc ∼ 1 K13,17 and
unusually large critical fields along the c-axis.18–21 The
superconducting phase is further peculiar as muon spectroscopy finds antiferromagnetism to persist into this
phase only being completely suppressed at pressures of
23.6 kbar following a second order transition indicative
of a quantum critical point.22 This is consistent with
AC susceptibility measurements under pressure.23 The
nature of this critical point has been further explored
by resistivity measurements under pressure and applied
magnetic field24 , but remains unclear due to the lack of a
high pressure and high field Fermi liquid phase. However,
we note that recent penetration depth measurements report magnetism and superconductivity coexisting up to
the largest pressures measured.25
The noncentrosymmetric crystal structure combined
with the strongly correlated electronic nature evidenced
by heat capacity, allows the possibility of novel unconventional electronic orders.26,27 In centrosymmetric superconductors, spin-up and spin-down bands are degenerate in energy, however when the crystal structure is non
centrosymmetric, spin-orbit coupling can split these two
bands and the orbital and spin wave functions cannot
be treated independently.28 Magnetic fluctuations may
therefore play a key role in superconductivity29–31 and
this has been further implicated by the transport and
spectroscopic measurements outlined above which seem
to suggest that the Neel and superconducting temperatures are correlated.
We characterize the magnetic fluctuations in the low
temperature Kondo screened, normal state, and at ambient conditions in CeRhSi3 by applying neutron inelastic
scattering. This paper is divided into six sections including this introduction and a final summary and conclusions component. We first discuss the single-ion crystal
field theory to motivate our spectroscopic experiments.
The experiments and materials are described in the next
section along with how we utilized the multidetector array on MACS to correct for the background. We then
present our data illustrating the competing commensurate and incommensurate response in CeRhSi3 and discuss the results in terms of a heuristic model based on
weakly coupled Kramers doublets.

SINGLE-ION CRYSTAL FIELD THEORY

As a starting point towards understanding the neutron
scattering cross section characterizing the magnetic excitations and static order in CeRhSi3 , we review the crystal field theory results and also calculate matrix elements

relevant for the discussion of the static and dynamic magnetism in this heavy fermion compound. In the discussion section below, we apply this analysis to investigate
the possibility that the thermally isolated ground state
doublet can be considered in terms of projecting onto
a jef f = 1/2 angular momentum operator. For Ce3+
with j=5/2 in a local C4ν environment, as is the case
for CeRhSi3 in Fig. 1 (a), the crystal field scheme should
consist of 3 Kramers doublets. The corresponding Hamiltonian takes the following form,
HCEF = B20 O20 + B40 O40 + B44 O44

(1)

where Onm are the Stevens operators based on angular
momentum operators acting on the |j, mi basis and Bnm
are the Stevens parameters.33
To obtain an idea about how much neutron scattering intensity should reside in the different crystal field
doublets and in particular the intensity in the inelastic
and elastic channels, we have taken the following Stevens
parameters extracted from susceptibility measurements.
TABLE I. Stevens coefficients taken from Ref. 32.
B20 = -0.151 meV
B40 = 0.0329 meV
B44 = 0.409 meV

The resulting crystal field scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1
(b) and found to be in good agreement with the energy
values of the crystal field excitations extacted from neutron inelastic scattering experiments. Substituting these
coefficients into HCEF , we can obtain the eigenstates
and calculate the matrix elements characterizing the elastic and inelastic neutron cross sections. We then obtain

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Having outlined the background and crystal field theory describing the magnetic excitations, we now discuss
the experimental techniques and results obtained with
neutron scattering.
A.

Materials and scattering experiments:

Materials Preparation and Sample Mounting: Single
crystals of CeRhSi3 were synthesized using a flux technique. Given the relatively small sample sizes for neutron
scattering, an array of 2 g of single crystals were aligned
on a series of Aluminum plates as displayed in Fig. 2 (c)(d) with the rocking scan shown in Fig. 2 (a), indicating
a mosaic of 4 degrees. The individual single crystals were
secured to the plates using hydrogen-free Fomblin oil and
covered with Aluminum foil as shown in Fig. 2 (c − d).
The Aluminum plates were shaped in circles with two
pins so that sample could be aligned and swapped between the H0L and HHL scattering planes. Given the
sample mounting, our sample was on average centrosymmetric as the mounting does not distinguish between ±
c of the individual crystals.

with gJ =6/7 for Ce . The above calculation suggests,
based on the single-ion crystal field Hamiltonian, a large
dynamic cross section in the neutron scattering response
and comparatively little intensity in the elastic channel,
a result consistent with initial powder work with neutrons.36 A similar situation exists with YbRh2 Si2 with a
small ordered moment in comparison with the spectral
weight in the inelastic channel.37 The crystal field prediction of a low static ordered magnetic moment at low
temperature is consistent with the small entropy gain
measured from heat capacity (only 0.08 R ln 2) which is
one of the smallest values found for Ce3+ based materials.13 The small static magnetic moment may therefore
possibly be indicative of the underlying crystalline electric field rather than quantum criticality38 which would
mark the boundary between an itinerant phase and one
where the mass of electrons diverge being characterized
by more localized magnetism.15 Such a critical point has
also been suggested to host a Griffiths phase.39 The lack
of quantum criticality has been supported by transport
measurements under pressure40 and the presence of lowenergy spin fluctuations has been implicated as the origin
of the linear resistivity.29

CeRhSi3 confirming a transition at ∼ 1.8 K. (c)-(d) The sample mount used for the neutron inelastic scattering studies on
CeRhSi3 discussed in the main text.

Heat capacity measurements were performed on a
3.2 ± 0.5 mg sample, using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design) in a temperature
range between 1.2 and 3 K. A relaxation method with a
2τ fitting procedure was used. The data displayed in Fig.
2 (b) shows a transition near 2 K expected from magnetic
ordering.
Neutron Spectroscopy: Attempts to search for a static
magnetic Bragg peak using the D23 diffractometer (ILL,
France) were not successful in resolving a temperature
dependent signal from the background. This maybe expected based on the crystal field analysis discussed above
which suggests a comparatively weak static moment in
comparison to the inelastic scattering. We therefore focussed our measurements on studying the dynamics with
spectroscopy.
Initial triple-axis measurements were carried out on
the PANDA spectrometer (FRM2) where it was established that the magnetic scattering was highly extended
in momentum space. This was further confirmed by experiments on the SPINS spectrometer (NIST). Given the
need for measurements of a broad range in momentum
space, the MACS cold triple-axis spectrometer (NIST)
was utilized. Cooled filters of Beryllium and Beryllium
Oxide were placed before the monochromator and after
the sample respectively. With a fixed Ef =3.7 meV, this
configuration afforded energy transfers up to 1.3 meV.
The use of a double filter configuration was found neces-

sary to remove higher energy neutrons from scattering off
the monochromator onto the sample. In such a situation,
without the first Beryllium filter, it was found that the
sample mount and Fomblin oil gave a large background
making extraction of the magnetic signal difficult and
unreliable.

Motivated by the observation of a commensurate response which maybe indicative of ferromagnetic interactions, we measured the neutron inelastic response under
a magnetic field. We note that in YbRh2 Si2 , the incommensurate response was found to be strongly affected by
an applied field.8 Measurements with a magnetic field
were done using the IN12 cold triple-axis spectrometer
at the ILL with Ef =3.5 meV and using a 6 T cryomagnet with a He-3 insert so that temperatures as low as 0.5
K could be reached.

B.

Background Subtraction on MACS

Given our complex sample mounting scheme shown
in Fig. 2, background scattering of neutrons from the
Fomblin grease and also the Aluminum sample holder
were an issue. We outline here how the magnetic inelastic signal was isolated from the background using the
detector arrangement on the MACS cold triple-axis spectrometer (NIST). The wide coverage of MACS allowed
for a simultaneous measurement of both the magnetic inelastic signal and also a large background region where a
comparatively strongly temperature dependent magnetic
signal was not observed.
The methodology used to calculate the background for
any given temperature and energy is illustrated in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3 (a) shows the smoothed intensity including background and magnetic scattering adding equivalent data
at ± L positions. The intensity consists of a main mag-

also includes Bragg peaks that occur near the (1, 0, 1)
and (-1, 0, 1) positions. The relative strength of this
background varied with temperature and energy. Therefore, the background needed to be approximated at each
temperature and energy.
To subtract this background, for a given temperature
and also energy transfer, we have removed strips that
contained the magnetic signal and the Bragg peaks, as
shown in Fig. 3 (b). The remaining data was then used
to determine a radially averaged background, as shown
in Fig. 3 (c). This averaging did not consider small angle
scattering from the main beam indicated by the bright
region about the origin in Fig. 3. Subtracting Fig. 3
(c) from Fig. 3 (a) returns the magnetic inelastic signal
shown in Fig. 3 (d). A similar background subtraction
procedure has been applied in a recent study on MACS
investigating CeCo(In1−x Hgx )5 (x=0.01).41

Having discussed the single-ion properties of CeRhSi3
and the experimental details, we discuss the results obtained for the dynamic neutron response. We first show
the temperature dependence of the correlated low-energy
magnetic scattering. Motivated by previous neutron
scattering reports of a weak low temperature magnetic
Bragg peak at (∼ 0.2, 0, 0.5)1 , we focussed our measurements in the (H, 0, L) scattering plane. Figure 4 shows
the temperature dependence of the correlated magnetic
~
scattering near Q=(0,0,2)
taken on MACS with the sample oriented in the (H0L) plane and with the background
subtracted following the methodology discussed above.
Figure 4 (a − c) illustrates a low temperature constant
E=0.5 meV slices at T=0.3 K, 6 K, and 10 K. The results show enhanced but momentum broadened scatter~
ing near Q=(0,0,2)
for these three temperatures. We note
~
that the commensurate scattering at the Q=(0,0,2)
is
strongly contaminated by nuclear elastic scattering given
that (0,0,2) is an allowed crystallographic Bragg peak.
The background corrected scattering near (0,0,2) in Fig.
4 (a) consists of both a sharp component originating from
scattering from the nuclear peak and also scattering elongated along the L direction and extending over the entire Brillouin zone. The momentum broadened rods of
scattering are elongated along L indicative of weak correlations along c. With increasing temperature, shown in
Figs. 4 (b) and (c), the scattering decreases in intensity,
confirming the magnetic origin.
Figure 4 panels (d − f ) illustrates cuts through these
~
rods of scattering near Q=(0,
0, 2) integrating along L
in the (H, 0, 1.5 ± 0.2) direction. At low temperatures
(T=0.3 K) shown in Fig. 4 (d), two clear peaks can be
seen symmetrically displaced along H located at H0 =0.14
± 0.03. On heating, the structure disappears until 10 K
where the scattering is well described by a commensurate
peak centered at H=0. The low-energy magnetic scattering in CeRhSi3 therefore crosses over from incommensurate scattering along H to a commensurate response with
increasing temperature.
Having established the presence of momentum broadened correlations along L which weaken with increasing
temperature as expected for magnetic scattering, we now
show the energy dependence at low temperatures. Figure
5 shows a series of constant energy slices taken at T=0.5
K using the MACS spectrometer. At low-energy transfers of E=0.5 meV (panel a), extended scattering along
L which is peaked near H=0.14 ± 0.03 r.l.u. is found.
However, as shown in Figs. 5 (b) and (c), on increasing
the energy transfer the scattering becomes weaker and
~
also centered around the commensurate Q=(0,0,2)
position. For energy transfers at E=1.0 meV, shown in Fig.
5 (c), the scattering remains highly extended in momentum yet more centered at the commensurate position.
The magnetic scattering therefore crosses over from an
incommensurate response to a commensurate response

through either increasing the energy transfer, or temperature.
The experimental data has primarily been taken in
the (H,0,L) plane motivated by the discovery of a weak
magnetic Bragg peak in this scattering plane. However, in most tetragonal heavy fermion materials, like
Ce(Rh,Co)In5 family, the scattering is located near the
antiferromagnetic (0.5, 0,5) position.8,37,42 In Figure 6,
the neutron response in both the (H,0,L) and (H,H,L)
scattering planes is compared at a series of energy transfers. The scattering in both planes is qualitatively similar
with the magnetic scattering being highly extended along
the L direction. At low temperatures and energy transfers, in the (H, H, L) plane as illustrated in Fig. 6 (d),
the scattering is also suggestive of being extended along
the [1,1,0] direction. With increasing energy transfer,

the scattering broadens and weakens considerably near
the (0,0,2) position in both scattering planes.
The presence of magnetic scattering near the commensurate (002) position is suggestive of an underlying ferromagnetic response as observed in YbRh2 Si2 .37 While ferromagnetism in Ce based compounds is rare, it has been
reported in CeRuPO43 and also CeSb2 44 . However, given
the body centered nature of the crystallographic structure, it is also consistent with an antiferromagnetic interaction between nearest Ce3+ neighbors along c. To test
for this hypothesis, we have applied a vertical magnetic
field in order to check for a strong response of the magnetic fluctuations. These experiments were performed
on IN12 and are summarized in Fig. 7 comparing a constant (H, 0, 1.5) scan at 0 and 6 T at low temperatures.
While the data is statistics limited, we do not observe a
strong or significant response of magnetic fluctuations to
a magnetic field aligned within the a − b plane. As an
additional check for a possible ferromagnetic response,
the elastic (0,0,2) nuclear Bragg peak was also studied as
a function of magnetic field with no measurable change
observed. Based on this and the lack of a strong change
with applied field in the inelastic channel, we conclude
that the underlying interaction is dominated by antiferromagnetic interactions.

To investigate this point, we have transformed the coordinates of the angular momentum operators from a
|j, mi basis to the a basis corresponding to the eigenstates of the the crystal field Hamiltonian HCEF (denoted as the |CEF i basis). This corresponds to writing
a transformation matrix with the columns the eigenstates

energy doublet by ∼ 19 meV = 220 K. Given the energy
scale separating these two excitations, at low temperatures we would expect this doublet to be well separated
from the higher energy and then to possibly behave as a
jef f = 1/2 magnet similar to the spin-orbit split levels
in Co2+45 or 4d or 5d transition metal ions.45–50 In this
section, we investigate this point by studying the lowest
energy doublets and the angular momentum operators in

HEURISTIC DESCRIPTION

Having presented the experimental results, we now attempt to understand the interplay between the commensurate magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures and
energies and the crossover at low energies and temperatures to an incommensurate response. We first discuss
the results in terms of over damped jef f = 1/2 spin
waves and show that the local crystal field symmetry
is not consistent with such a description. We then discuss the fluctuations in terms of weakly coupled Kramers
doublets through the use of the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). We find that this later approach allows
us to reproduce, qualitatively, the interplay between commensurate and incommensurate responses.

To determine if the ground state doublet can be projected
onto a jef f =1/2 angular momentum operator, we consider the upper 2 × 2 matrix (denoted in blue ) which operates on this subspace. Calculating this for the Ãx , Ãy ,
and Ãz operators we get,

These 2 × 2 matrices do not follow the canonical commutation relations summarized by J~ × J~ = iJ~ as satisfied
by the Pauli spin matrices which belong to the SU(2)
group. We therefore conclude that the ground state crystal field doublet of CeRhSi3 , while isolated at low temperatures from higher energy crystal field doublets, cannot be projected onto a jef f =1/2 angular momentum
operator. Therefore, Ã 6= αJ, where J is an angular
momentum operator and α is a scaler projection factor.
From a symmetry perspective, this result is not surprising given the highly anisotropic crystalline electric field.
We will discuss this result below in parametrizing the
low-energy and temperature dependent spin fluctuations
in CeRhSi3 .

Correlated relaxing Kondo sites

The magnetic scattering illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5 is
highly extended both in momentum and energy, display~ − ω structure like that reported in other more
ing little Q
localized Ce3+ based systems such as CeRhIn5 42,51 or discussed in the context of temporally sharp spin excitations
in CeCoIn5 52 . Therefore, parameterization of the excitations involving crystal fields or well defined harmonic
magnons is not appropriate to describe the low-energy
magnetic dynamics in CeRhSi3 at ambient pressures.
Furthermore, the crystal field analysis discussed above illustrates that the ground state cannot be projected onto
a jef f = 21 ground state and therefore damped spin wave
theory involving Heisenberg coupling of jef f = 21 spins
cannot be applied. Any heuristic model must be able
to describe the temperature and energy dependence of
the magnetic excitations discussed in the previous sections. In particular, the results outlined above indicate
two competing effects with one described by a commensu~
rate wavevector near Q=(0,0,2)
and another associated
with the low temperature incommensurate wave order
appearing near H ∼ 0.2. In this section, we investigate
whether a weakly correlated lattice of Kondo sites can
consistently describe the commensurate scattering and
the extended nature of it in momentum. We emphasize
that this model is not unique and similar incommensurate to commensurate magnetic responses have been observed in a number of materials notably in, for example,

imaginary part of the susceptibility. To model the energy broadened commensurate component, we note that
the extended nature of the neutron cross section in momentum indicates weak correlations between Ce3+ sites.
We therefore consider a single-site susceptibility describing fluctuations within the ground state of the localized
Kramers doublet with a characteristic energy scale Γ set
by the relaxational timescale τ via Γ ∼ τ1 . This results
in a single site susceptibility given by,

χ0 (ω) =

X0 Γ

Γ − iω

where X0 is the temperature dependent single site static
susceptibility. Similar single-site susceptibilities have

9
been used to describe the paramagnetic scattering in Uranium based heavy fermions53–55 and also in the paramagnetic phase of the cuprates56,57 . In this case, given that
the dominant single-ion cross section discussed above
is for transitions between members of the ground state
doublet, this susceptibility can be interpreted physically
as transitions between the members of the lowest energy Kramers doublet with a timescale set by τ ∝ Γ1 .
We therefore term this single-ion response as a relaxing
Kramers doublet.
To parameterize the coupling of these relaxing
Kramers doublets on different Ce3+ sites, we apply the
random phase approximation (RPA) which gives a final
susceptibility with the following form,

We note that this form of χ is an odd function in energy
required for detailed balance.58 Given the scattering is
confined along the (0,0,L) direction and extended along L
indicative of short-range correlations, we have considered
the cross section from in-plane fluctuations and weakly
correlated Ce3+ spins along c. The neutron cross section
can therefore be written as,

Fig. 8 (a) illustrates the X0 and J phase diagram with

 indicatingwhere in H the term in the suscepti~ is a minimum and therefore where
bility 1 − X0 J(Q)
the neutron scattering cross section is maximum. The
value of Γ was chosen to be 0.5 meV to match the energy
range were strong magnetic fluctuations are observed on
MACS. The plot is done for X0 and J and shows that
for small values of the susceptibility, X0 , a maximum in
the scattering cross section occurs at the commensurate
value H∼ 0 where for larger values of either X0 or J, the
cross section is maximum at H=0.25 when 2πH = 1/2.
This is further illustrated in Figs. 8 (b, c) which plots
constant energy slices for the two extreme cases. Panel
(b) shows the scattering cross section for the case of both
large susceptibility X0 and also large correlations along
c. The intensity profiles display peaks displaced along
H near H=0.25 and also L=0.5. When the susceptibility
X0 is reduced, the cross section becomes peaked around
the commensurate position as illustrated in panel (c).
This simple and heuristic model of correlated and
relaxing localized Kramers doublets captures the main
qualitative results of our experiments. The calculations
with Γ=0.5 meV provide an estimate for the exchange
constant of ∼ 1 meV (assuming X0 ∼ 1µ2B /meV ) to be
compared with an estimate of ∼ 10 meV extracted from
the Kondo temperature and specific heat coefficient. Our
choice of X0 is consistent with Q = 0 susceptibility measurements which indicate a low temperature susceptibility of order ∼ 10−2 emu/mol.32 Our calculated value is
sensitive to the choice of Γ also X0 , but nevertheless is
in reasonable agreement with the value estimated based
on Ref. 14.
The experimental results shown above exhibit a trade
off in intensity between incommensurate magnetic scattering peaked near (∼ 0.2,0,1.5) and also the commensurate (0,0,2) position. The maximum in the cross section
shifts with increasing temperature or energy transfer. In
both cases, our model would imply that such a change in
either energy or temperature coincides with a reduction
in susceptibility X0 . We note that neutron diffraction
results have reported a Bragg peak near ~q0 =(∼ 0.22, 0,
0.5). The displacement of the wavevector from the 0.25
position along H may be accounted for through incorporating further neighbor exchange constants resulting in a

CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

The momentum and energy broadened response reported here for CeRhSi3 differs from dispersing spin
waves measured in insulating magnets and also metallic compounds with strongly localized moments. In this
context CeRhSi3 differs from other non centrosymmetric
systems like CePt3 Si which displays momentum dispersing spin wave excitations, albeit damped.59 The energy
and momentum broadened spin response at low energies

10
also contrasts to the localized systems with the same
crystal structures such as CeCoGe3 60 and CeIrGe3 61 and
is suggestive of a highly itinerant f -electrons. This latter point is consistent with quantum oscillation measurements which fail to measure a divergence in effective
mass in the magnetic phase as a function of pressure
which would indicate a crossover to strongly localized
moments.62
The results presented here also differ from muon results
which suggest static magnetism on the MHz timescale.
We observe relaxational dynamics with a frequency scale
on the order of THz, and this may indeed be outside
the time window of muons. The pressure dependence of
the magnetic ordering22 has been interpreted in terms of
the Doniach phase diagram14,63 which captures the competition between RKKY driven antiferromagnetism and
a Kondo screened state64–66 separated by a critical exchange constant value. Our results point to CeRhSi3 being on the borderline between these different phases with
relaxational dynamics reminiscent of a screened antiferromagnetic phase without long range order. However, our
results are consistent with a weak RKKY coupling between sites and also a growing susceptibility which drives
the incommensurate order. This might point to the existence of well defined spin excitations at low-energies
in more localized variants such as CeCoGe3 where much
higher pressures (∼ 4 GPa) are required to achieve superconductivity67 and where also thermodynamic measurements suggest a weaker Kondo effect than in CeRhSi3 12 .

We would expect a decrease in JRKKY with pressure as
Kondo screening becomes more prevalent. This is consistent with thermoelectric measurements under pressure68
and also resistivity on CeRhSi3 .69
In summary, we have measured the low energy magnetic response in CeRhSi3 at ambient pressures and at
low temperatures. A momentum and energy broadened
response is observed which crosses over from commensurate at high energies to a incommensurate wave vector along H at low energy transfers and low temperatures. The response is not consistent with dispersing or damped spin excitations as observed in other Ce
based non centrosymmetric superconductors. We find
a heuristic model based on weakly correlated relaxing
and strongly Kondo screened localized Kramers doublets
qualitatively accounts for this behavior. We suggest
that CeRhSi3 is on the border between a RuddermanKittel-Yosida antiferromagnetic phase with strong and
underdamped magnetic correlations and a fully Kondo
screened phase where no correlations exist.
