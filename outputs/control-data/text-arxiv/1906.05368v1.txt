A BSTRACT. We show that for a sequence of random graphs Brouwer’s conjecture holds true with probability tending to one as the number of vertices tends to infinity. Surprisingly, it was found that a similar
statement holds true for weighted graphs with possible negative weights as well. For graphs with a fixed
number of vertices, the result implies that there are constants C > 0 and n0 such that if n ≥ n0 then among
n
n
all 2(2 ) graphs with n vertices, at least (1 − exp (− Cn )) 2(2 ) graphs satisfy Brouwer’s conjecture.

from matrix theory. This conjecture seems to be a difficult problem and to this date it remains open.
In this paper we present an approach to this problem using methods from random matrices and
random graphs. Here we address the following question: for how many graphs inequality (1.1)
holds? In contrast to what previous investigations have been focused so far, instead of approaching
the problem for graphs enjoying a prescribed structure, we show that a great proportion of graphs
satisfy the conjecture.
In this paper it is shown that Brouwer’s conjecture holds asymptotically almost surely for random
graphs under general conditions to be specified later. That is to say that graphs that potentially do not
satisfy the inequality in Brouwer’s conjecture are rare, in a precise measure theoretic sense. That suggests a change of focus in the research that has been done on this problem so far. Instead of searching
for new families of graphs for which the conjecture holds, one should attempt to understand these
rare cases for which the conjecture potentially do not hold.
It comes as a surprise that this approach reveals that a similar statement holds true for weighted
graphs, and even with possible negative weights. To state the result precisely some notation is
needed. First, we denote by wuv the weight of an edge uv ∈ E and set wuv = 0 in case uv ∈
/ E.
Then, we define e( G ) = ∑uv∈ E wuv . The Laplacian matrix of a weighted graph have the number
−wuv in the off-diagonal entry uv and ∑ j6=u wuj in the diagonal entry uu. As usual, an unweighted
graph can be seen as a {0, 1} weighted graph with its standard Laplacian matrix. Clearly, in this case
| E| = e( G ). We show that for a weighted graph G and for k = 1, . . . , n we have

A random weighted graph Gn is a graph with n vertices and edge weights given by a random
(n)

variable ξ ij for each ij ∈ [n]. Throughout this paper a sequence of random weighted graphs is under
the general condition described as follow:

It is interesting to understand what this result is saying for the set of graphs with fixed number
of vertices. For such graphs this result is implying a strong statement that quantifies the number of
graphs satisfying Brouwer’s conjecture. In fact, the most simple instance of Theorem 1 is the most
meaningful for the conjecture. To see that consider the Erdős–Rényi random graph with probability
1/2 and distribution G (n, 1/2), i.e., a graph drawn from this distribution has n vertices where each
pair of vertices has an edge with probability 1/2 independently at random. It is a basic fact that any
graph with n vertices is equally likely in the distribution G (n, 1/2). Therefore, Theorem 1 implies that
n

for n ≥ n0 among all 2(2 ) graphs with n vertices that exist, at least (1 − exp −Cn) 2(2 ) graphs satisfy
Brouwer’s conjecture.

1/2
µ
The hypothesis σnn logn n
→ ∞ in Theorem 1 ensures that µn /σn is not approaching zero too
fast. That is necessary because of the concentration of the largest eigenvalue around µn n and because
there is a threshold phenomena
happening here. When µn /σn goes to zero fast, the largest eigenvalue
p
concentrates around σn n logn. In that case we still can apply the same method, but the difference
in concentration requires a different analysis. For this reason


range, where µn /σn goes to zero in such a way that

We get into the detailed proof in the next section, where we first present the method from a general
perspective. Our intention is to give an insight on how such ideas can be used to provide bounds for
the partial sum of eigenvalues of random matrices from different ensembles.
2. I DEA

AND PROOFS

The main idea is straightforward and it consists in finding functions f and g depending on n
satisfying:

• There
h exists n0 isuch that f (n) ≤ g(n) for n ≥ n0
• P ∑ki=1 λi ≤ f → 1 as n → ∞
h
i
• P g ≤ e( Gn ) + (k+2 1) → 1 as n → ∞

Once we figure out what f and g should be, by Bonferroni’s inequality we clearly have

And that finishes the proof. It is also clear that the technical challenge here is to find such functions.
To do that, we need some information about the spectrum as n increases. For instance, if the limiting
spectral distribution is known, then we can obtain a candidate for f , which will be an approximation
of the limit. For g we can use some Chernoff-type bound for the random variable that amounts the
total edge weight.
We remark that there is nothing particular in this idea about the Laplacian matrix. Apart from the
fact that Brouwer’s conjecture claims what the correct bound should be, this method can be applied
to any matrix ensemble for which we know the limiting spectral distribution.
Next, we proceed with the proof of the main results. Our analysis relies on the following technical
lemma which fully describes the aforementioned relevant functions f and g.
Lemma 3. If µn ∈ (0, 1 − γ] for some γ ∈ (0, 1), then there are ǫ > 0, δ > 0, and n0 such that for all n ≥ n0
we have

for all k ∈ R.
Proof. First, we define a polynomial in k by f (k) := µn (1 − δ) (n2 ) + (k+2 1) − k(1 + ǫ)µn n. That has
discriminant
∆ = n2 µn (δ − 1 + µn (ǫ + 1)2 ) − nµn (δ + ǫ) + 1/4.

It suffices to find ǫ, δ, and n0 such that the discriminant is negative for all n ≥ n0 . To this end, we use
the upper bound on µn to obtain
∆ ≤ n2 µn (δ − 1 + (1 − γ)(ǫ + 1)2 ) − nµn (δ + ǫ) + 1/4.

BROUWER’S CONJECTURE HOLDS ASYMPTOTICALLY ALMOST SURELY

Now fix δ = γ2 /2 and ǫ > 0 such that (ǫ + 1)2 = 1 + γ. That allow us to bound the discriminant by
∆ ≤ n2 µn (δ − 1 + (1 − γ)(1 + γ)) − nµn (δ + ǫ) + 1/4

= n2 µn (δ − γ2 ) + 1/4

= −n2 µn γ2 /2 + 1/4.

Clearly, for n large enough the last expression is dominated by the term −n2 µn γ2 /2 and therefore
there exists a n0 such that for all n ≥ n0 we have that f (k) > 0 for all k. That proves the lemma.

To estimate the largest eigenvalue λmax ( Ln ) we use Corollary 1.1 (b1) and (b2) from [2].

Now, we are ready to proceed with the main proof which was roughly sketched in the beginning of
this section.

Now, the proof of Theorem 2 is basically the same, only the details in the analysis change. For that

To show it we define a polynomial in k by f (k) := k2 − k(2 + ǫ)σn n log n + Cµn (1 − δ) n2 . This
polynomial has discriminant
∆ = (2 + ǫ)2 σn2 n log n − 2Cµn (1 − δ) n2 .

It suffices to find ǫ, δ, and n0 such that the discriminant is negative for all n ≥ n0 . In fact, it is enough
to choose any ǫ > 0 and δ ∈ (0, 1). Notice that ∆ < 0 is equivalent to
