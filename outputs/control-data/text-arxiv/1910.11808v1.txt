Dedicated to Gabriel Thierrin
on the occasion of his eightieth birthday
Abstract
In [1] the concept of nondecreasing Dyck paths was introduced.
We continue this research by looking at it from the point of view
of words, rational languages, planted plane trees, and continued
fractions. We construct a bijection with planted plane trees of
height ≤ 4 and compute various statistics on trees that are the
equivalents of nondecreasing Dyck paths.

Personal reminiscences about Gabriel Thierrin
Gabriel Thierrin invited me to London, Ontario, for six weeks in February/March 1982. My memories about that trip are still very much alive
since it was my first crossing of the atlantic ocean, and I was a very inexperienced traveller at that time, and everything was new to me. Snow
storms, arctic temperatures, clear blue skies, frozen sidewalks! I had
the opportunity to visit Waterloo, to give a talk, and to see the Niagara
falls, and to learn that Canada has best proportion of great rock bands
versus total population.
I am only guessing, but I think that Gabriel Thierrin was the referee
of [4] and was attracted by the combination of formal languages and

other mathematical concepts, perhaps not the standard ones in this
context. I always liked the concepts of words, languages, grammars,
and automata, but I also wanted to see them in a wider context, mostly
in a combinatorial one. This is still true today, where I only occasionally
bump into some (formal) languages.
Gabriel Thierrin invited me to his house several times, and he and
his wife were extremely friendly and helpful. Once, he gave a party, and
David Borwein also attended. Later in life I met his sons Jonathan and
Peter.
We also wrote the paper [5] together.
I remember much more, more than about any other trip I guess, but
perhaps I should rather stop here.
In the technical part of this paper, I want to demonstrate a charming interplay of Dyck paths (related to Dyck words, of course), certain
rational languages and their associated generating functions (being best
described as continued fractions), and some families of trees. The form of
the generating functions cries out for bijections, and they are described
in the sequel. Several characteristic parameters are also counted.

Introduction

In the paper [1], the Italian authors come up with the lovely new concept
of nondecreasing Dyck paths. Dyck words are geometric renderings of
Dyck paths where an open bracket is coded by an upward step, and
a closing bracket by a downward step. The condition “nondecreasing”
means roughly that the sequence of the altitudes of the valleys must be
nondecreasing. We prefer to think about it in terms of planted plane
trees; there is an obvious and well–known bijection, [2, 6].
In honour of one of the authors, we decide to call the corresponding
trees Elena trees, or simply Elenas 1 .
In [1] the generating function of nondecreasing Dyck paths of length
z(1−z)
2n was already found to be 1−3z+z
2 . We find it practical also to include
1

In the literature, there are also Patricia trees (tries).

1 − 3z + z 2

Since the length 2n corresponds to an Elena of size (=number of nodes)
n + 1, we find the generating function of Elenas as
X
z(1 − 2z)
E(z) =
[Number of Elenas of size n] z n =
.
1 − 3z + z 2
n≥0

Now here is an easy argument to see that directly. We use the letter p
to describe an arbitrary path of length ≥ 1 and the letter a which means
‘advance to next node on the rightmost branch.’ Then the set of Elenas
E is given by the symbolic equation (a rational language)
∗
E = ap∗ a .

The continued fraction form suggests a relation to planted plane trees
of height ≤ 4; a bijection is constructed in the next section.
The following sections consider average values of several simple parameters of Elenas. For simplicity, we give only first order asymptotics,
but explicit values (in terms of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers) and also
variances should not be too hard to obtain.
Then we deal with the harder problem of the average height of (random) Elenas of size n.
√
We will use the number α = 1+2 5 frequently in this paper, since
it is prominent in the asymptotics of Fibonacci numbers (and thus also
Elenas).

A bijection

The continued fraction representation for E(z) is well known in tree
enumeration; it enumerates the set of planted plane trees with height
≤ 4 (compare e.g. [2, 6]).
Now we will describe a bijectionbetween Elenas and those trees. We
∗
start from the representation ap∗ a and give an alternative interpretation of the words in this set as height restricted trees.
First, a path with n nodes (coded by pn ) will be interpreted as a
root, followed by n − 1 subtrees of size 1.

Then, a word ap . . . p will be interpreted as a root, followed by subtrees given by the p’s.
Finally, the last a will be the root, and the ap . . . p’s become subtrees
of it. Figure 6 describes the process.
Geometrically, one can imagine the process as follows. We consider
the rightmost branch of an Elena, take its right node as a root, move the
rest into horizontal position and rearrange the edges so that the nodes

Number of descendants

The number of descendants of a node is the size of the subtree with this
node as the root. The paper [3] deals e. g. extensively with this subject.
We want to know the average number of descendants. This is an average
over both, the Elenas, and the nodes in an Elena. Thus it is meaningful
to define for an Elena t
X
ψ(t) :=
[number of descendants of v]
v a node of t

and
D(z, u) :=

X

z |t| uψ(t) ;

t∈E

∂
D(z, u) u=1 . Now we want
then we find the desired average as n1 [z n ] ∂u
to derive a functional equation for this function D(z, u). Of course we
follow the general decomposition (1). The contribution of each path
attached to the root is
X
m+1
Q(z, u) =
z m u( 2 ) .

The contribution of the root is zun , which is handled by first neglecting
it and then substituting zu for z. Altogether we find
D(z, u) = zu +

zu D(zu, u)
.
1 − Q(zu, u)

Now let us differentiate this w. r. t. to u and plug in u = 1. We can also
use the special values
D(z, 1) = E(z)
as well as
Q(z, 1) =

Number of ascendants

The number of ascendants of a node is defined to be the number of nodes
on the path of the node to the root. It is also called the depth. And the
sum over all depths (summed over all nodes in the Elena) is called the
path length. It is very similar to the area, studied in the paper [1].
However, it is quite easy to see that the average number of ascendants
equals the average number of descendants: Consider two nodes i and j
such that i lies on the path from the root to j. Then i appears in the
count of j of the number of ascendants, and j appears in the count of i
of the number of descendants. Since these quantities are summed over
all nodes, we are done. (This argument is general and not restricted to
Elenas.)

Average height of Elenas

The recursion E = a + (ap∗ )E translates into E = z + z(1−z)
1−2z E and also
into the recursion for Eh , the generating functions of Elenas of height
≤ h,
z(1 − z)
Eh−1 .
Eh = z +
1 − 2z + z h
Denoting the generating functions of Elenas of height > h by Uh , we
find by taking differences
(1 − 2z + z h )Uh =
We find the average height as
[z n ]
Now define U (z, w) :=

Summing up we get

(1 − 3z + z 2 ) U (z, 1) + U (z, z) =

z(2 − 6z + 5z 2 )

1 − 3z + z 2

From this we see that U (z, 1) has a double pole at the dominant singularity z = λ := 1/α2 . Since for all h ≥ 0
