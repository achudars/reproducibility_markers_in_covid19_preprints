(Posted on the arXiv on 17 January 2019)
We stand by our findings in Phys. Rev. A 96, 022126 (2017). In addition to refuting the invalid
objections raised by Peleg and Vaidman, we report a retrocausation problem inherent in Vaidman’s
definition of the past of a quantum particle.

In their Comment [1] on Ref. [2], Peleg and Vaidman
correctly state that there is a fundamental difference in
the way Vaidman answers the question Where was the
particle after entering and before leaving the interferometer? and our traditional approach. We examine the
traces left by the particle — by an unambiguous path
discrimination measurement or by any other suitable
method — and then infer the path in accordance with
the result found. This can yield definite path knowledge,
or probabilistic path knowledge, or no path knowledge at
all, depending on how the traces are examined and what
is found. For us, then, a statement such as “this particle
went through checkpoint C” has an operational meaning,
which derives from interpreting measurement results by
the usual applications of the tools of standard quantum
mechanics.
By contrast, Vaidman defines that the particle was
where it left faint traces — meaning: in all places where
computed weak values are nonzero, for which the particle may have to be in several places simultaneously. Even
when the traces are indiscernible and of no phenomenological consequence, Vaidman maintains that the particle
has visited all places for which the computation yields a
nonzero weak value. In the context of Vaidman’s threepath interferometer, these are all places where both wave
functions are nonzero, namely the usual “forward” wave
function that emerges from the source and the “backward” wave function that interferes constructively at the
actual output port only.
The situation is depicted in Fig. 1, for a particle detected at exit iii, a variant of Fig. 2 in [2]. The thickness of the blue lines is proportional to the squared amplitudes of the forward wave function, and likewise for
the red lines and the backward wave function. This picture refers to the extreme situation of indiscernible traces

FIG. 1. The source S emits particles into the three-path interferometer. Beam splitters BS2 and BS3 are symmetric
and the inner-loop interferometer is balanced. Beam splitters BS1 and BS4 are asymmetric, they transmit two-thirds
of the incident particles and reflect one-third. Only particles
detected at exit iii are considered. The blue lines follow the
usual “forward” wave function that emerges from S, with the
line thickness proportional to the probabilities (squared amplitudes). The red lines follow the “backward” wave function
that has unit probability for delivering the particle to exit iii,
with the same significance of the line thickness. While both
wave functions have nonzero amplitudes in the inner loop, the
only blue or red links from the source S to the exit iii bypass
the inner loop and go through checkpoint C.

( = 0 in [2]), or to the conditioning on the inconclusive
outcome of the unambiguous path discrimination.
We observe that the wave function branches associated with the checkpoints A and B inside the inner loop,
whether blue or red, do not connect the source S to exit
iii. According to standard quantum mechanics, therefore, these branches are irrelevant as they do not contribute to the probability of detecting the particle at this
exit. The only link is through the checkpoint C. This
is what standard quantum mechanics says about prese-

2
lected (≡ emitted by source S) and postselected (≡ detected at exit iii) particles. Accordingly, Peleg and Vaidman’s assertion that “the standard formalism has no any
answer” for pre- and postselected particles is incorrect.
According to Vaidman’s definition, however, each particle detected at exit iii left a faint trace at checkpoint A
and at checkpoint B and also at checkpoint C on its
way from the source to the detector; each particle was
at all three checkpoints simultaneously. Peleg and Vaidman tell us that one must not examine the traces of a
single particle (as one would usually do before making
statements about the particle’s whereabouts) but that
the “information about the traces is obtained either by
a calculation, or by a measurement performed on the
pre- and postselected ensemble.” Nevertheless, Vaidman
insists that each particle individually was at the three
checkpoints simultaneously — and the evidence are the
faint traces that the particle left at each checkpoint but
they must not be examined . . .
Central to Vaidman’s reasoning is that the particle interacts weakly with the stuff it encounters on its way,
such as transferring a bit of momentum to the mirror
at a checkpoint. In a simplified description [5], the particle’s passing through the interferometer results in the
before-to-after transition

+ |(out)b ; no, yes, noi


where (in) and (out) symbolize sets of quantum numbers
for the particle’s center-of-mass motion and, for example,
|(out)a ; yes, no, noi stands for a trace at checkpoint A and
no traces at checkpoints B and C. An individual particle
leaves a trace at one of the checkpoints. Since there are
“yes” terms for all three checkpoints, a measurement on
a large ensemble of particles would exhibit evidence for
the traces of all three kinds. In Vaidman’s reading, however, Eq. (1) states that each particle leaves traces at all
checkpoints although there is no |(out); yes, yes, yesi term
to account for that [6].
Despite being told otherwise, we did examine the
traces of a single particle in Ref. [2] and found that all
particles in the pre- and postselected ensemble went only
through checkpoint C in the limit of ultrafaint traces
( → 0). This is exactly what standard quantum mechanics tells us (see above). It is also what common sense
tells us in conjunction with basic knowledge about interferometers.
In standard quantum mechanics, there are situations
in which questions such as Through which arm of the
interferometer did the particle arrive? do not have an
answer, and then we insist that We do not know. is
the correct reply. The basic example is that of a well
stabilized two-path interferometer, say of Mach–Zehnder
design. Whenever standard quantum mechanics does not
provide an answer, one may feel invited to define the past

of the particle in a fitting way. Vaidman accepted this
invitation, as advocates of Bohmian mechanics had done
earlier.
Now, while providing answers where there were none
before, such definitions must always give the correct answer in all situations in which there already is one without the added definition. This is a basic test of consistency. Bohmian mechanics fails this test although it
took some time before an example was found that demonstrates the case [3, 4]. Vaidman’s definition fails the test,
too, as we established by our analysis of the three-path
interferometer that he himself designed.
Peleg and Vaidman disagree with this verdict. They
claim that our “argument for a particular single-path
story can be repeated equally well for another single
path” and if that were true it would indeed imply that we
contradict ourselves. But below we show it is not true.
In our analysis of the three-path interferometer of
Fig. 1, with a balanced inner-loop interferometer, we observe that the probability of detecting the particle at exit
iii does not change when we introduce a phase γ into the
amplitude at checkpoint C. Since this is a relative phase
between the amplitudes that meet at beam splitter BS4,
and are then processed by BS4, we conclude that these
phases are incoherent. Upon this observation, we then
proceed with the accounting exercise in Sec. IV B of [2]
that culminates in the conclusion that all particles reach
exit iii through checkpoint C when  → 0.
Peleg and Vaidman did not find an error in this argument. Instead they try to construct a contradiction —
and fail. They begin by recalling that the said probability
is [7]
p(α, β, γ) =  +

2
1 − 3 iγ
e + eiβ − eiα ,

(2)

when phase factors eiα , eiβ , and eiγ multiply the probability amplitudes at checkpoints A, B, and C, respectively. Yes, as noted above, there is no dependence
on γ when the inner-loop interferometer is balanced
(eiα = eiβ ), and so we get our “argument for a particular
single-path story” — via C, that is. Peleg and Vaidman
then consider the situation of eiα = eiγ and note that the
dependence on β disappears, and so they wrongly conclude that there is equally strong evidence for the “via B”
single-path story.
Why is this conclusion wrong? Simply because our accounting exercise cannot be carried out when the balance
of the inner-loop interferometer is disturbed (eiα 6= eiβ );
there are now coherences between the amplitudes arriving at BS4.
This becomes obvious if we replace BS4 with a beam
splitter with more general properties, one that reflects with probability R and transmits with probability
T = 1 − R. Then Eq. (2) is replaced by

and this dependence disappears only when R = 13 , T = 23 ,

It follows that the accounting exercise is justified for
α = β, when it leads to the “all via C” conclusion, but it
is not justified for α = γ 6= β. The reasoning put forward
by Peleg and Vaidman, who wrongly conclude that “all
via B” is as valid as “all via C,” is of no consequence.
Other objections raised by Peleg and Vaidman are
equally invalid. It is not necessary that we address them
all. Instead, we point out that Vaidman’s definition has
yet another implication that speaks against adopting it.

applies for all intermediate R values (0 < R < 1) with adjusted line thicknesses, not only for R = 13 . While there
is no γ dependence in Eq. (4), confirming that incoherent
amplitudes meet at BS4, there is a dependence on α − β,

As noted above, Fig. 1 applies when the inner-loop
interferometer is balanced and 0 < R < 1 with the necessary adjustments of the line thickness. For all intermediate R values, then, we have Vaidman’s narrative that
a particle detected at exit iii has earlier left traces at
checkpoint A and at checkpoint B and also at checkpoint
C. For R = 1, we have Fig. 2 with vanishing weak values at checkpoints A and B. In this situation, Vaidman’s
narrative is that a particle detected at exit iii has earlier
left a trace at checkpoint C, but did not leave traces at
checkpoints A and B. Accordingly, a last-moment choice
between R = 31 and R = 1 is a choice between these two
different pasts of the quantum particle, at a time when
the trace-leaving (or not) has already happened earlier.
While retrocausation of this kind is disquieting for Vaidman’s definition of the particle’s past, it has no bearing
on the story told by standard quantum mechanics: Both
in Fig. 1 and in Fig. 2, the particle passes through checkpoint C only on its way from the source S to the exit iii.
