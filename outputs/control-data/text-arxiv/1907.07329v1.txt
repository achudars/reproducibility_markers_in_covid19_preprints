Introduction

Replica symmetry breaking phenomena in disordered spin systems have been studied extensively, since
Talagrand proved Parisi’s replica symmetry breaking formula [18] for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
[19] in a mathematically rigorous manner [20]. It is well known that the replica symmetry breaking
appears generally in mean field disordered spin models at low temperature as a spontaneous symmetry
breaking phenomenon. There have been lots of discussions whether or not, the random field Ising model
has some nontrivial phases due to its randomness such as replica symmetry breaking phase or spin glass
phase. Krzakala, Ricci-Tersenghi, Sherrington and Zdeborova have pointed out an evidence that spin
glass phase does not exists in the random field Ising model, the random field Ginzburg-Lamdau model
and random temperature Ginzburg-Landau model [16, 17], which satisfy the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Ginibre
(FKG) inequality [11]. Recently, Chatterjee has proved the absence of replica symmetry breaking in the
random field Ising model in an arbitrary dimension rigorously [2]. He proved that the variance of the spin
overlap vanishes almost everywhere in the coupling constant space of the random field Ising model using
the FKG inequality [11] and the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities. His method has been extended to quantum
systems with the weak FKG property [15]. In the present paper, we prove that the replica symmetry
breaking does not occur also in the random field Ginzburg-Landau model, as well as the random field
Ising model.
First, we define the model and several functions. Coupling constants in a system with quenched
disorder are given by i.i.d. random variables. We can regard a given disordered sample as a system
obtained by a random sampling of these variables. All physical quantities in such systems are functions
of these random variables. Consider a disordered Ginzburg-Landau model on a d dimensional hyper
cubic lattice ΛL := [1, L]d ∩ Zd whose volume is |ΛL | = Ld . Let J = (Jx,y )x,y∈Λ be a real symmetric
matrix such that Jx,y = 1, if |x − y| = 1, otherwise Jx,y = 0. Define Hamiltonian as a function of spin
configuration φ = (φx )x∈ΛL ∈ RΛL by
X
X
Jx,y φx φy − h
H(φ, g) := −
gx φx ,
x∈ΛL

|x,y∈ΛL

where a vector g = (gx )x∈ΛL consists of i.i.d. standard Gaussian random variables with a real constant
h. Here, we define Gibbs state for the Hamiltonian. For a positive β, the partition function is defined by
Z
Dφe−βH(φ,g) ,
(1)
ZL (β, u, h, r, g) :=
R|ΛL |

1

where the measure Dφ is defined by
Dφ =

Y

4

2

dφx e−uφx +rφx

x∈ΛL

for u > 0 and r ∈ R. The expectation of a function of spin configuration f (φ) in the Gibbs state is given
by
Z
1
Dφf (φ)e−βH(φ,g) .
(2)
hf (φ)i =
ZL (β, h, u, r, g) R|ΛL |
Define the following functions of (β, h, u, r) ∈ [0, ∞)3 × R and randomness g = (gx )x∈ΛL
ψL (β, h, u, r, g) :=

1
log ZL (β, h, u, r, g),
|ΛL |

(3)

− |ΛβL | ψL (β, h, u, r, g) is called free energy in statistical physics. We define a function pL : [0, ∞)3 × R → R
by
pL (β, h, u, r) := EψL (β, h, u, r, g),

(4)

where E stands for the expectation of the random variables (gx )z∈ΛL .
Next, we consider replica symmetry breaking phenomena which apparently violate self-averaging of
the overlap between two replicated quantities in a replica symmetric expectation. Let φa (a = 1, · · · , n)
be n replicated copies of a spin configuration, and we consider the following Hamiltonian
1

n

H(φ , · · · , φ , g) :=

n
X

H(φa , g),

a=1

where replicated spin configurations share the same quenched disorder g. This Hamiltonian is invariant
under an arbitrary permutation σ ∈ Sn .
H(φ1 , · · · , φn , g) = H(φσ1 , · · · , φσn , g)
This permutation symmetry is the replica symmetry. The spin overlap Ra,b between two replicated
spin configurations is defined by
1 X a b
Ra,b :=
φx φx .
|ΛL |
x∈ΛL

The covariance of the Hamiltonian is written in terms of the overlap
EH(φa , g)H(φb , g) − EH(φa , g)EH(φb , g) = |ΛL |h2 Ra,b .
When the replica symmetry breaking occurs, broadening of the overlap distribution with a finite variance
is observed. This phenomenon is well-known in several disordered systems, such as the SherringtonKirkpatrick model [18, 20, 21]. In the present paper, we define replica symmetry breaking by the finite
variance calculated in the replica symmetric expectation in the infinite volume limit
6 0,
lim Eh∆R1,2 2 i =

L→∞

where ∆R1,2 := R1,2 − EhR1,2 i. Chatterjee has given this definition of the replica symmetry breaking
and proved
(5)
lim Eh∆R1,2 2 i = 0,
L→∞

in the random field Ising model [2]. In the present paper, we extend his proof to the random field
Ginzburg-Landau model. We prove the following theorem.
Theorem 1.1 In the random field ferromagnetic Ginzburg-Landau model, the following variance vanishes
lim [EhR1,2 2 i − (EhR1,2 i)2 ] = 0,

L→∞

2

(6)

for almost all coupling constants (β, u, h, r) ∈ [0, ∞)3 × R2 in the infinite volume limit. Here, we roughly
sketch Chatterjee’s proof for the random field Ising model and explain a key to extend it to the random
field Ginzburg-Landau model.
From the view point of detecting the spontaneous symmetry breaking, observe another variance
lim hδR1,2 2 i,

L→∞

calculated in the replica symmetric Gibbs state, where δR1,2 := R1,2 − hR1,2 i. If this variance does not
vanish in a sample, a strong fluctuation should yield an instability of the replica symmetric Gibbs state
and one can expect spontaneous replica symmetry breaking. This phenomenon corresponds to a long
range order in systems without disorder as discussed by Griffiths [13]. First, Chatterjee prove
lim EhδR1,2 2 i = 0,

(7)

L→∞

by the FKG inequality and another inequality obtained from the boundedness of R1,2 in the random field
Ising model. In the random field Ginzburg-Landau model, however, there is no simple bound for the
truncated correlation function
hφx φy i − hφx ihφy i,
unlike its sample expectation
E(hφx φy i − hφx ihφy i) ≤ C,
for a positive number C. To show the limit (7) in the random field Ginzburg-Landau model, we prove a
bound
X
1
E(hφx φy i − hφx ihφy i)2 ≤ K|ΛL |− 4 ,
x,y∈ΛL

for a positive number K. Next, Chatterjee points out a relation between two variances Eh∆R1,2
i and
2
EhδR1,2
i. For the disordered Ising systems,

2 lim Eh∆R1,2 2 i = 3 lim EhδR1,2 2 i = 6 lim Eh∆R1,2 i2

L→∞

are obtained from the Aizenman-Contucci [1, 5] or the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities [2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12].
Therefore, the identity (7) implies stronger identity (5), then the proof has been completed for the
random field Ising model. The naive extension of this argument to the random field Ginzburg-Landau
model derives a kind of the Ghirlanda-Guerra type identities including the self-overlap R1,1 because of
φ2x 6= 1, they are not useful to prove the identities (8). We use a new method to obtain the variance bound
on R1,1 , and then we obtain the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities as a useful form to prove the identities (8).
In the present paper, we prove that all variances of the spin overlap vanish in the replica symmetric Gibbs
state in another way for the random field ferromagnetic Ginzburg-Landau model.

where k is an arbitrary even integer and Ck is independent of the system size L.
Proof. This is proved by an inductivity for even integer k. First, we consider this bound in the case

Note that the right hand side in the above denotes the Gibbs expectation in the independent spin model.
Then the left hand side Ehφ2x i is finite for a sufficiently large b, since the one point function Ehφ2x i0 in
the independent model has a simple upper bound.
Next, we consider the case for an even integer k ≥ 4. An integration by parts with respect to a spin

Therefore, Ehφkx i for an even integer k is bounded from the above by Ehφxk−2 i. This and the bound (10)
for k = 2 complete the proof. 
Lemma 2.2 The following infinite volume limit exists
p(β, h, u, r) = lim pL (β, h, u, r),
L→∞

for arbitrary coupling constants.
Proof. This is proved by a standard argument based on the decomposition of the lattice into disjoint
4

blocks [8, 9, 13]. Let L, M be positive integers and denote N = LM , then we divide the lattice ΛN into
M d disjoint translated blocks of ΛL . Define a new Hamiltonian H on ΛN by deleting interaction bonds
near the boundaries of blocks, such that M d spin systems on the block ΛL and its M d − 1 translations
have no interaction with each other. The original Hamiltonian HN has the following two terms
HN (φ, g) = H(φ, g) + Hdel (φ, g),
where Hdel is deleted interaction Hamiltonian, and H denotes the summation of Hamiltonians on the M d
disjoint blocks. Define the following function of s ∈ [0, 1] by
Z
1
E log Dφ exp[β(H + sHdel )].
πN (s) :=
|ΛN |
Note that πN (1) = pN (β, u, h, r) and πN (0) = pL (β, u, h, r). The derivative functions of πN are given by

configuration. Since the function πN (s) is convex, we have

then

Since the expectation

is bounded as shown in Lemma 2.1, |EhHdel is | is bounded by the number of deleted bonds. Then, there
exist positive numbers K independent of L and N , such that the function pN and pL obey

The sequence pL is Cauchy. 
Note 2.3 The functions p, pL ψL are convex functions of each argument for arbitrarily fixed others.
Note 2.4 The function p is differentiable almost everywhere in the coupling constant space [0, ∞)3 × R
because of its convexity.
Hereafter, we use a lighter notation ψL (g) for ψL (β, h, u, r, g). Define the function of s ∈ [0, 1]
√
√
G(s) := sgx + 1 − sgx ′ ,
where g = (gx )x∈ΛL and g ′ = (gx′ )x∈ΛL consist of i.i.d. standard Gaussian variables. Define a generating
function γL (s) of a parameter s ∈ [0, 1] by
γL (s) = E[E′ ψL (G(s))]2 ,

(11)

where E and E′ denote expectation over g and g ′ , respectively. This generating function γL is introduced by Chatterjee [4]. We denote the Gibbs expectation of a function of spin configuration f (φ) with

We have used Lemma 2.11. 
The following two lemmas show that two kinds of variance of self-overlap R1,1 vanish. Proving these
two lemmas is necessary to obtain the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities for the random field Ginzburg-Landau
model, although they are automatically valid in the random field Ising model because of R1,1 = 1.

The Ghirlanda-Guerra identities

model in the useful form as well as those for Ising systems [1, 12] .

2.5

Concluding the proof of Theorem 1.1

As proved by Chatterjee for the random field Ising model [2], we use the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities.
Lemma 2.15 for n = 2 and f = R1,2 implies
2
lim [2EhR1,2 R1,3 i − EhR1,2
i − (EhR1,2 i)2 ] = 0,

L→∞

and it for n = 3 and f = R2,3 implies
lim [3EhR2,3 R1,4 i − EhR1,2 R2,3 i − EhR1,3 R2,3 i − (EhR1,2 i)2 ] = 0.

L→∞

Both are valid almost everywhere in the coupling constant space. The replica symmetric Gibbs state
gives
EhR1,2 R2,3 i = EhR1,3 R2,3 i = EhR1,2 R1,3 i.

Then the following relation between two kinds of variance

2 lim Eh∆R1,2 2 i = 3 lim EhδR1,2 2 i,
L→∞

L→∞

is obtained. Lemma 2.12 implies

lim Eh∆R1,2 2 i = 0.

L→∞

This completes the proof of Theorem 1.1. 
