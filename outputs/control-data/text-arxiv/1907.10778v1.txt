Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have been proposed as a tool to witness quantum information scrambling in many-body system dynamics. These correlators can be understood as averages
over nonclassical multi-time quasi-probability distributions (QPDs). These QPDs have more information, and their nonclassical features witness quantum information scrambling in a more nuanced
way. However, their high dimensionality and nonclassicality make QPDs challenging to measure
experimentally. We focus on the topical case of a many-qubit system and show how to obtain such a
QPD in the laboratory using circuits with three and four sequential measurements. Averaging distinct values over the same measured distribution reveals either the OTOC or parameters of its QPD.
Stronger measurements minimize experimental resources despite increased dynamical disturbance.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has attracted considerable recent attention in high energy
physics [1–15] and condensed matter physics [16–26].
It helps characterize quantum information scrambling
due to the spread of entanglement, and has found utility in applications ranging from black hole thermalization to quantum chaos. Alongside the theoretical effort, there has been increasing interest in finding experimental methods to measure such a quantity in modern
quantum simulators (e.g., [27–31]). These controllable
quantum systems may be used to simulate and measure
exotic dynamics that are otherwise out of experimental
reach, such as quantum state teleportation through a
traversable wormhole [32, 33].
Expanding upon the idea of the OTOC, we recently introduced a more refined and robust informationscrambling witness by decomposing the OTOC into
its extended (coarse-grained) Kirkwood-Dirac [34–40]
quasiprobability distribution (QPD) [41, 42]. This QPD
has since found utility in entropic uncertainty relations
for scrambling [43], and is closely related to a witness for
quantum advantage in postselected metrology [44]. The
OTOC signals interesting scrambling behavior when it
decays to a persistently small value; to produce this decay, its associated QPD must exhibit negative or nonreal values, despite satisfying all other properties of a
probability distribution. The OTOC is an average over
this QPD, so it has less information than the full QPD
about the probed system dynamics. Moreover, while the
OTOC can also decay due to decoherence in a manner
that seems qualitatively similar to the decay from information scrambling, the nonclassical features of the corresponding QPD can only diminish with decoherence. As
such, the QPD robustly distinguishes such decoherence
from scrambling [45], making it an attractive candidate
for experimental use.
The apparent problem with the QPD is that it is a 4argument distribution, and thus seems to require the ex-

perimental measurement of many more parameters than
the OTOC. Indeed, for a qubit OTOC there are 2 real parameters to measure, but its corresponding QPD ostensibly has 2 × 24 = 32 real parameters in the distribution.
Without a practical method of determining all the parameters composing the QPD, its advantages compared
to an OTOC are reduced.
In this paper we show that a qubit QPD can be measured using the same sequential measurement circuit used
to determine the OTOC itself, which demonstrates that
it is no more difficult to measure in spite of its highdimensionality. We accomplish this feat through two
simplification steps: First, we show that the 32 real parameters of the QPD are redundant and can be reduced
to 8 independent correlators. Second, we generalize the
method that we introduced in Ref. [46] for measuring
qubit OTOCs using 2 circuits of sequential measurements. We show that the same circuits also yield all 8
correlators that determine the QPD. Moreover, the statistical error is minimal when all but the first measurement are projective, with the first only slightly weakened.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we
review the OTOC and its associated QPD. In Section III
we review sequential qubit measurements and the key
results of Ref. [46]. In Section IV we detail how to measure the QPD efficiently. In Section V we optimize the
measurement strengths to minimize statistical error. We
conclude in Section VI.

OTOCS AND THEIR QPDS

We consider the important case of a lattice of locally
interacting qubits, such as those used in modern quantum
computing hardware. When such a multi-qubit system
evolves with a Hamiltonian H, the dynamics can cause
initially localized information to spread through the lattice. More precisely, an initially localized single-qubit
operator A will typically evolve to have support over
multiple lattice sites in the Heisenberg picture, A(t) =
U † (t)AU (t), with i~∂t U (t) = HU (t) and U (0) = I. In-

2
tegrable Hamiltonians cause periodic evolution that will
relocalize such an operator at a future recurrence time.
However, non-integrable Hamiltonians can have an exponentially longer recurrence time [12, 47, 48] that persistently scrambles the information of the initially local
operators to cover the lattice. An OTOC and its QPD
can witness such information-scrambling behavior [45].
We assume in this paper that local qubit operators A
and B at distinct lattice sites square to the identity A2 =
B 2 = I and initially commute [A, B] = 0. At later times
t, however, B(t) can evolve to overlap the initial support
of A. We can detect such emergent overlap by averaging
the positive Hermitian-square of their commutator after
evolving only B,
C(t) := [A, B(t)]† [A, B(t)] = 2[1 − ReF (t)] ≥ 0. (1)
Since A2 = B(t)2 = I for any t, C(t) is determined by
F (t) := hB(t)AB(t)Ai,

(2)

which is an OTOC that satisfies F (0) = 1 and ReF (t) ≤
1. For a non-integrable Hamiltonian, persistent noncommutativity of A and B(t), i.e., C(t) > 0, causes ReF (t)
to drop to a small value for an extended duration [45].
The noncommutativity of A and B(t) also precludes
the existence of a classical joint probability distribution
over their eigenvalues, so prevents the OTOC from being understood as a simple eigenvalue average. Specifically, if we decompose A and B into their eigenprojecP

The parameter φ ∈ (0, π/2] is an angle that sets the measurement strength [46], with φ = π/2 corresponding to a
projective measurement of the eigenbasis of A, and φ → 0
corresponding to the weak measurement limit that leaves
ρ nearly unperturbed. For any φ, averaging the ancilla(A)

generalized eigenvalues [49–51] αφ,aP= (−1)a / sin φ recovers the expectation value hAi = a=0,1 αφ,a PφA (a).
A noninformative measurement causes phase backaction by entangling the eigenbasis of A with a mutually unbiased basis of the ancilla. Measuring the ancilla
then gives no information about A, but does produce a
measurement-controlled unitary effect generated by A on

The QPD p̃t is normalized,

classical probability distribution when A and B(t) commute, but can take imaginary and negative values when A
and B(t) do not commute. Thus, the interesting behavior
of the OTOC F (t) directly corresponds to when
P the aggregated nonclassicality of the QPD, N (t) := |p̃t |−1 ≥
0, becomes nonzero [45]. This nonclassicality is a witness
of information scrambling that is more robust to experimental imperfections than the OTOC itself [45].

An informative measurement of a qubit observable A
correlates the measured basis of an ancilla qubit with
the eigenbasis of A. Measuring a result a = 0, 1 on the
ancilla then causes (partial) collapse backaction in the
basis of A. Such a partial collapse modifies the state

SEQUENTIAL QUBIT MEASUREMENTS

We will measure the OTOC and its QPD with sequences of informative and non-informative ancilla-based
qubit measurements. Our analysis extends that of
Ref. [46], which provides explicit implementation circuits
and detailed derivations in its appendix.

where ai = 0, 1 is the outcome of the ith measurement.
As shown in Ref. [46], averaging this joint distribution
with the generalized eigenvalues αφi ,ai = (−1)ai / sin φi
exactly produces a correlation function involving nested
anticommutators of A1 , A2 , . . . , An :

Adding an informative measurement of B(t) produces
the two-measurement sub-circuit in Fig. 1(b) (blue, dotted). As discussed in Ref [46], measuring B(t) requires
first evolving the qubit system for a duration t, then coupling the eigenspace of B to an ancilla, then backwardevolving for a duration t. The backwards evolution may
be omitted if it occurs at the end of the subcircuit. According to Eq. (8), averaging the simple product

MEASURING A QPD

The QPD p̃t formally consists of 24 complex numbers, so apparently it requires experimental determination of 32 real parameters. However, we can reduce
this complexity to just 8 real parameters to measure
[42]. Since A2 = B 2 (t) = I, we use the identities
B(t)
a
= [I + (−1)b B(t)]/2
ΠA
a = [I + (−1) A]/2 and Πb
to expand the QPD in Eq. (4) into 24 terms that contain
only 8 real-valued correlators: hAi, hB(t)i, RehB(t)Ai,
ImhB(t)Ai, hB(t)AB(t)i, hAB(t)Ai, RehB(t)AB(t)Ai,
and ImhB(t)AB(t)Ai. Notably, two of these correlators
are the real and imaginary parts of the OTOC F (t) itself,
emphasizing that the QPD contains more information.
Once these 8 independent correlators are determined, the
entire QPD may be reconstructed.
We now consider how to measure each correlator in
turn by strategically averaging sequential measurements
as in Eqs. (8) and (10). Our goal is to measure all needed
terms with a minimum amount of experimental resources,
including both the number of measurement circuits and
the number of realizations of each required to obtain a
desired statistical error.
We show that a single circuit with four informative
measurements can determine 6 of the 8 correlators. The
remaining 2 correlators are determined by a related threemeasurement circuit that substitutes the first measurement with a noninformative measurement. To be systematic, we construct the circuit shown in Fig. 1 by adding
one measurement at a time.
A.

Two-measurement sub-circuit

(10)

In Ref. [46] we showed that the OTOC F (t) is
completely determined by four-measurement correlators
C AB(t)AB(t) and C˜AB(t)AB(t) . We will now analyze sequences of both informative and noninformative measurements more carefully to improve upon this result and
obtain all 8 correlators needed to construct the QPD p̃t .

over the distribution PφAa (a). We show later that the
other single-point correlator (i.e., expectation value)
hB(t)i can be obtained by the three-measurement subcircuit in Fig. 1(c) (green, dot-dashed).

One-measurement sub-circuit

We start from the smallest sub-circuit in Fig. 1(a) (red,
dashed) consisting of one informative measurement of A.
According to Eq. (8), we obtain hAi by averaging the
values
(−1)a
ξaA := αφa ,a ≡
(11)
sin φa

(12)

over the joint distribution PφA,B
(a, b) produces the cora ,φb
relator C A,B = h{B(t), A}i/2 = RehB(t)Ai. Substituting
the first measurement with a non-informative measureAB
ment as in Eq. (10) and averaging the same values ξa,b
yields C˜A,B = h[B(t), A]i/2i = ImhB(t)Ai instead [46].
For brevity, we omit the time-dependence of B(t) in the
remainder of the paper as understood.
To elucidate the structure of this sub-circuit, we
compute the measured distribution PφA,B
(a, b). Using
a ,φb
Eq. (5) we find

a ,φb

This form shows that marginalizing over b = 0, 1 cancels the last two lines to recover the result for the onemeasurement sub-circuit. However, marginalizing over
a = 0, 1 and averaging b with the generalized eigenvalues αφb ,b = (−1)b / sin φb only cancels the terms with hAi
and h{B, A}i to leave a linear combination of hBi and
hABAi, making it impossible to isolate those two correlators independently. Intuitively, the first measurement
of A (partially) collapses the state, which correlates the
result of the second measurement with the first.
Note that if we perform a weak measurement of the
observable A with φa ≈ 0, then the pre-factor of hABAi
in Eq. (13) becomes negligible compared to hBi because
it is quadratic in φa . In this case, the marginalization of
Eq. (13) approximates P (b), from which we can isolate
hBi. However, weak measurements require more experimental realizations to minimize statistical error, so instead we will directly isolate both hBi and hABAi after
adding one more measurement of A.

Three-measurement sub-circuit

Adding an informative measurement of A yields the
three-measurement sub-circuit in Fig. 1(c) (green, dotdashed). The joint probability distribution of the measured outcomes is then PφA,B,A
(a, b, a0 ). The struca ,φb ,φa0
ture of this distribution is similar to that of Eq. (13),
but we omit its full form for brevity. This joint distribution will allow us to obtain the correlators hBi,
hABAi, and RehBABAi, while the modified distribution
P̃φA,B,A
(ã, b, a0 ) will produce ImhBABAi.
a ,φb ,φa0

Following Eq. (8), averaging PφA,B,A
(a, b, a0 ) with
a ,φb ,φa0
the product αφa ,a αφb ,b αφa0 ,a0 produces the correlator
C A,B,A = h{{A, B}, A}/4i = hB + ABAi/2. This result
produces a second linear combination of hBi and hABAi,
which we can combine with a partial average of Eq. (13)
to isolate both hBi and hABAi separately. Solving this
linear system to obtain hBi yields the effective values

We note two important subtleties of this result. First,
B may be isolated in the measurement sequence (A, B, A)
because the first A measurement algebraically cancels
with the final A measurement, which is only possible
because A2 = I. Surprisingly, the later measurement
allows us to “undo” the effect of the earlier measurement. Second, this cancellation is only possible when
the first measurement is not projective, φa 6= π/2. Intuitively, a projective measurement would irreversibly collapse the state, preventing information from being re-

trieved and canceled. However, cancellation is possible
with any other measurement strength 0 < φa < π/2.
In addition to hBi and hABAi, we can also obtain the OTOC itself RehBABAi from the distribution
PφA,B,A
(a, b, a0 ). Much as PφA,B
(a, b) in Eq. (13) cona ,φb ,φa0

So far we have obtained 7 of the 8 correlators needed
to determine the OTOC QPD, with only hBABi remaining. Unfortunately, the three-measurement circuit is not
sufficient for the same reason that hBi could not be obtained from the sequence (A, B) in Eq. (13). That is,
after marginalizing a and b then averaging a0 we find

Four-measurement circuit

Adding one last informative measurement of A produces the full circuit in Fig. 1(d). The remaining hBABi
correlator can then be isolated. As with the hBi correlator, the effect of the first A measurement is undone by
subsequent measurements; however, the cancellation is
more complicated and involves measurement backaction
terms similarly to the OTOC correlators in the previous
section. To extract hBABi, we average the values

Notably, in Ref. [46] we used precisely the same fourmeasurement circuit as in Fig. 1 to obtain the real part of
the OTOC RehB(t)AB(t)Ai itself. As such, once we add

OPTIMIZING MEASUREMENT STRENGTH

All preceding derivations assumed arbitrary strength
measurements and ideal probability distributions. However, in practice one measures realization frequencies in
the lab, so both the experiment time and the statistical
error must be taken into account. For a finite ensemble of
realizations N the squared deviation of the mean value,
¯ 2 /N 2 ≤ (maxj ξ 2 )/N , is bounded
¯ 2 = PN (ξk − ξ)
(∆ξ)
j
k=1
from above by the largest averaged value. Here k ranges
over realizations and j ranges over possible outcomes in
one realization. Fixing the experiment time for one circuit realization and the admissible realization number
N , we should minimize this deviation of the mean to
conserve experimental resources.
As an example of this procedure, we examine the statistical error for one of the 16 QPD values:

where each k is a particular realization of the measurement sequence (a, b, a0 , b0 ). To minimize the statistical
error, we minimize the largest averaged value in this sum
over all free parameters φa , φb , φa0 , and φb0 . Numerical
minimization yields different optimal strengths for each
QPD value, with the one in Eq. (20) having strengths
φb = φa0 = φb0 = π/2,

φa ≈ (0.67) π/2.

(21)

For all QPD values, all measurements are optimally projective except the first measurement, which has an optimum that is still reasonably strong (φa ≈ (0.47) π/2 or
φa ≈ (0.67)π/2 ). A similar computation for the corB(t) A B(t)
responding imaginary part ImhΠA
+ Π+ Π+ Π+ i shows
that projective measurements are always optimal for all
measurements.

VI.

CONCLUSIONS

For multi-qubit systems possessing local observables
that square to the identity, we have reduced the problem of measuring the QPD behind the OTOC to that
of determining eight independent real-valued correlators,
in contrast to the 24 complex parameters that ostensibly
comprise the distribution. Six of these correlators can be
constructed from one data set of the four-measurement
circuit shown in Fig. 1. To minimize statistical error, all
but the first measurement can be made projective, with
only a slight strength reduction needed for the first measurement. The remaining two correlators can be obtained
from a second data set from a slight variation of the same
circuit that replaces the first measurement with a noninformative measurement and uses only three projective
measurements. These simplifications greatly reduce the
experimental difficulty for determining such a QPD.
The present work demonstrates that the same circuit
used to sequentially measure a multi-qubit OTOC can
also be used to determine all eight correlators needed
to parametrize the QPD behind the OTOC. Thus, for
qubits the QPD is no more difficult to measure with sequential measurements than the OTOC alone. We expect
that measurements of this sort are presently attainable in
modern quantum computing hardware. We also expect
that aspects of this work may be extended to qutrits and
higher-dimensional systems, where the assumption that
observables square to the identity breaks down.
