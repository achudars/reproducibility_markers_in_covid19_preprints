ABSTRACT

© 2019 The Authors

The time-variable velocity fields of solar-type stars limit the precision of radialvelocity determinations of their planets’ masses, obstructing detection of Earth twins.
Since 2015 July we have been monitoring disc-integrated sunlight in daytime using a
purpose-built solar telescope and fibre feed to the HARPS-N stellar radial-velocity
spectrometer. We present and analyse the solar radial-velocity measurements and
cross-correlation function (CCF) parameters obtained in the first 3 years of observation, interpreting them in the context of spatially-resolved solar observations. We
describe a Bayesian mixture-model approach to automated data-quality monitoring.
We provide dynamical and daily differential-extinction corrections to place the radial
velocities in the heliocentric reference frame, and the CCF shape parameters in the
sidereal frame. We achieve a photon-noise limited radial-velocity precision better than
0.43 m s−1 per 5-minute observation. The day-to-day precision is limited by zero-point
calibration uncertainty with an RMS scatter of about 0.4 m s−1 . We find significant
signals from granulation and solar activity. Within a day, granulation noise dominates,
with an amplitude of about 0.4 m s−1 and an autocorrelation half-life of 15 minutes.
On longer timescales, activity dominates. Sunspot groups broaden the CCF as they
cross the solar disc. Facular regions temporarily reduce the intrinsic asymmetry of the
CCF. The radial-velocity increase that accompanies an active-region passage has a
typical amplitude of 5 m s−1 and is correlated with the line asymmetry, but leads it
by 3 days. Spectral line-shape variability thus shows promise as a proxy for recovering
the true radial velocity.

INTRODUCTION

The Sun is the only star that can be observed with spatial
resolution fine enough to discern the finest convective and
magnetic elements that decorate its surface. Tiny though
they are, these small surface elements have a profound impact on the integrated solar spectrum. The contrast between
the hot, upwelling cores of granules only a few hundred km
across and the cooler surrounding downflow lanes gives rise
to global spectral-line asymmetries (Dravins, Lindegren, &
Nordlund 1981). These asymmetries are strongly suppressed
by small-scale magnetic fields in the faculae that surround
large sunspot groups (Cegla et al. 2013). The finite number
of granules, and their finite lifetimes, give rise to statistical fluctuations in the global solar radial velocity (Ludwig
2006). The changing filling factor of sunspots and faculae as
the Sun rotates gives rise to larger perturbations in global
radial velocity and line asymmetries (Meunier, Desort, &
Lagrange 2010).
Early campaigns to monitor the solar radial velocity
in integrated sunlight (e.g. Deming et al. 1987) were motivated by the need to understand the intrinsic variability of
solar-type stars at a time when high-precision studies of stellar radial velocities (e.g. Campbell & Walker 1979) were in
their infancy. At about the same time, the Birmingham Solar
Oscillations Network (BiSON, Chaplin et al. 1996) started a
39-year campaign of radial-velocity monitoring of integrated
sunlight, with the goal of using low-order p-modes in the solar oscillation spectrum to probe the Sun’s deep interior.
In the era of ultra-high precision radial velocity instruments such as ESO’s High-Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet
Searcher (HARPS, Pepe et al. 2004) and its northern counterpart HARPS-N (Cosentino et al. 2012), Keck’s High Resolution Échelle Spectrometer (HIRES, Vogt et al. 1994),
the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable
Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO, Pepe et al. 2014)
at the VLT, the EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer (EXPRES, Jurgenson et al. 2016) at Lowell Observatory and
others following up transiting terrestrial-sized planet candidates from the CoRoT, Kepler/K2 and TESS space photometry missions, the need has become acute to understand
the frequency spectrum and origins of stellar radial-velocity
variability. Studies such as the recent “radial-velocity fitting
challenge” of Dumusque et al. (2017) are designed to test
the efficacy of novel analysis tools for modeling star-induced
RV variability as part of the measurement process, and have
highlighted the need to understand the underlying physics.
Using an approach developed by Fligge, Solanki, & Unruh (2000) for modelling solar irradiance variations, Meunier, Desort, & Lagrange (2010) pioneered the study of the
effects of different types of solar activity on the global solar radial velocity. By partitioning solar images from the
Michaelson Doppler Imager (MDI) aboard SoHo into quietsun, sunspot and facular regions according to their continuum brightness and magnetic flux density, and isolating the
relative velocities of the different components in the Dopplergrams, Meunier et al. concluded that the dominant contributor to solar radial-velocity (RV) variability is convective suppression of the granular blueshift. This prediction
was confirmed observationally by Haywood et al. (2016),
who used the same technique on images from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics

Observatory (SDO) to model radial-velocity variations in
integrated sunlight reflected from asteroid 4/Vesta.
The HARPS-N solar telescope (Phillips et al. 2016; Dumusque et al. 2015) was conceived with a longer-term goal
in mind: to monitor precisely the solar radial velocity during
the day using the same instrument as is being used at night
for measuring the reflex orbital motions of exoplanet host
stars. By using the stellar data-reduction pipeline for the solar spectra, we aim to characterise the impact of both solar
variability and instrumental and data-reduction systematics
on the radial velocities delivered by the instrument.
The analysis of the solar data is complicated by two considerations that do not apply to stellar targets. The observer
and the target are both participants in solar-system gravitational dynamics, and the Sun is not a point source. The
purpose of the present paper is to describe the methods used
to correct for these non-stellar effects, transforming the data
to the equivalent of the sidereal, heliocentric frame. The goal
is to separate the effects of solar photospheric physics from
those of solar-system dynamics and differential atmospheric
effects.
In Section 2 we describe briefly the instrument, the observing strategy and the data-reduction pipeline. We develop
a Gaussian mixture-model approach to determine daily extinction coefficients and to quantify the reliability of data
points affected by short-term obscuration of parts of the
solar disc. We correct the radial velocities for differential
extinction across the solar rotation profile and use the good
data within single days to assess the level of residual p-mode
and granulation noise on minutes-to-hours timescales. In
Section 3 we transform the radial velocities delivered by the
pipeline from the barycentric frame (which is dominated by
the synodic radial-velocity signal of Jupiter) to the heliocentric frame. We provide algorithms for correcting line-profile
moments of the HARPS-N cross-correlation function (CCF)
for the Earth’s changing orbital velocity and the obliquity
of the solar rotation axis to the ecliptic. In Section 4 we
analyse the behaviour of the radial velocity and CCF profile
parameters on timescales from days to years. We identify
fluctuations in the width and asymmetry of the CCF profile with the passages of sunspot groups and large facular
regions across the solar disc, respectively. We identify correlations and temporal offsets between these parameters and
the radial velocity, and discuss their viability as proxy indicators for disentangling exoplanetary orbital reflex motion
from host-star activity.

HARPS-N SOLAR TELESCOPE
OBSERVATIONS
Instrument and observing strategy

The HARPS-N solar telescope comprises a small guided telescope on an amateur mount, housed in a perspex dome
on the exterior of the enclosure of the 3.58-m Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo (TNG) at the Observatorio del Roque de
los Muchachos, Spain. Its 7.6-cm achromatic lens of 200mm
focal length feeds sunlight via an integrating sphere and an
optical fibre into the calibration unit of the HARPS-N spectrograph. The telescope, fibre feed and control systems are
described by Phillips et al. (2016). Early results from the

occurs because the Sun rises behind part of the TNG enclosure.

instrument were published by Dumusque et al. (2015), confirming that it achieves uniformity of throughput better than
1 part in 104 over the solar disc. This performance is essential
to achieve velocity precision of 10 cm s−1 across the width
of the solar rotation profile.
The instrument observes the Sun continuously each day,
with 5-minute integration times designed to average out solar p-mode oscillations. The seasonal variations in hour angle
are shown in Fig. 1. Observing begins each clear day when
the Sun rises above an altitude of ∼ 20 degrees, and ends
either at the same altitude or earlier, if the instrument is
required for afternoon setup by the night-time observer.

2.2

HARPS-N data reduction pipeline

The data are reduced using the same HARPS-N DataReduction System (DRS) employed for night-time stellar radial velocimetry. Calibration exposures taken after the end
of solar observations and before the start of night-time observing each day provide order-by-order information on the
locations of the echelle orders and the wavelength calibration scale. Fabry-Perot exposures are recorded simultaneously with the solar exposures to monitor instrumental drift,
via a second optical fibre from the spectrograph calibration
unit. Following optimal extraction (Horne 1986; Marsh 1989)
to obtain one-dimensional background-subtracted spectra in
each order, the data are calibrated in wavelength. They are
then cross-correlated with a digital mask (Baranne et al.
1996; Pepe et al. 2002) derived from a typical G2 stellar
spectrum, and corrected for instrumental drift derived from
the Fabry-Perot spectrum. The radial velocity is computed
as the mean velocity of a Gaussian fit to the CCF profile.
The (dimensionless) contrast of the CCF is expressed as the
maximum depth of the fitted Gaussian, expressed as a percentage of the surrounding pseudo-continuum. The area W
of the fitted Gaussian is then proportional to the product of
MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

The units of W and F are the same, in this case velocities
in km s−1 , because the pseudo-continuum of the CCF is
normalised to unity. Although C is normally expressed as
a percentage, the expression above treats it as a fraction
0 < C < 1. The “area” is therefore defined in a manner
similar to the equivalent width of a single spectral line.
The CCF itself is not perfectly symmetric, mainly because of the convective asymmetry in solar and stellar line
profiles resulting from the brightness and velocity structure
of the photospheric granulation pattern. This asymmetry is
quantified as the difference in the line-bisector velocity in
the upper and lower parts of the CCF, commonly referred
to as the Bisector Inverse Slope (BIS; Queloz et al. 2001).
The DRS computes the formal uncertainty in each
radial velocity by propagating the photon-noise error of
the spectrum through all stages of extraction and crosscorrelation, into the CCF. The error of the RV precision
is then measured using the derivative of the CCF (Bouchy,
Pepe, & Queloz 2001). The median radial-velocity precision
achieved with a standard 5-minute exposure is 0.43 ms −1 in
observing conditions of high transparency; the upper 95th
percentile is 0.77 m s−1 .
2.3

Data quality assessment

Under normal circumstances the SNR of the radial velocity is determined primarily by photon shot noise and wavelength calibration error. Large systematic errors in the radial
velocity can, however, arise when part of the solar disc is obscured, for example by cloud or by temporary tracking errors
in the telescope mount. This happens because the solar disc
has a finite angular diameter and a projected equatorial rotation speed of order 2 km s−1 . Partial obscuration of the
solar disc distorts the rotation profile and corrupts the measured radial velocity. It is therefore mandatory to identify
and flag data points with anomalously low fluxes relative to
neighbouring points.
The worst outliers are eliminated by rejecting the 5 percent of the data with the poorest estimated radial-velocity
errors, followed by an iterative 6-sigma clip of the radial
velocities in the heliocentric frame.
It is relatively straightforward to perform more rigorous automated data-quality assessment because the spectral fluxes observed in cloud-free conditions should follow
an exponential extinction law as a function of airmass. To
determine the apparent magnitude of the Sun, we use the
SNR estimate for pipeline order 60 (echelle order 98, central
wavelength 6245 Å) recorded in the HARPS-N data headers.
The SNR is proportional to the square root of the recorded
photon count. We therefore construct a sequence of instrumental magnitudes of which the ith measurement is

Figure 2. The upper panels show the instrumental magnitude in order 60 as functions of hour angle (left) and airmass (right) on a clear
day (2018 Apr 03) with good transparency but intermittent clouds or guiding errors during the day. The lower panels show the radial
velocity corrected for differential extinction, and the median probability for each data point that it belongs to the foreground (good)
mixture population as given by Eq. 10 of Sec. 2.3: Pr(good data) is synonymous with p(qi = 0|y)
. Points are colour-coded from blue to red in order of descending median probability that they belong to the foreground population.
The extinction coefficient k60 and transparency fluctuation amplitude σjit are small.

On a day of near-optimal observing conditions, such as
the clear spring day affected by occasional scattered clouds
illustrated in Fig. 2, we expect the relation between the instrumental magnitude m60 (xi ) in order 60 and the airmass xi
of the centre of the solar disc to be represented by a linear
(Bouguer’s Law, Bouguer 1729) model
m60 (xi )

=

m60 (x = 0) + k60 xi

⇒ m60 (xi ) − m60 ( x̂)

=

k60 (xi − x̂).

(4)

The slope k60 of the linear extinction law is the primary
extinction coefficient, while m60 (x = 0) is the instrumental
magnitude extrapolated to zero airmass using the extinction
law. We use the inverse variance-weighted mean airmass x̂
and the corresponding magnitude m60 (x = x̂) as the origin
for the linear regression, to eliminate correlation between
the slope and the zero-point of the extinction law.
In addition to the fiducial magnitude m60 ( x̂) at the mean
airmass and the extinction coefficient k60 we include a white2 representing low-level transnoise variance parameter σjit
parency fluctuations. This mitigates the risk of rejecting usable data in observing conditions where the transparency is
imperfect but slowly-varying, as is the case shown in Fig. 3
for a day affected by the calima conditions often encoun-

tered in summer when fine dust is blown westward from the
Sahara desert over the observatory. Even on a clear day, the
extinction coefficient may vary subtly with time and/or hour
angle (Poretti & Zerbi 1993).
It is not clear that simple methods such as iterative
sigma-clipping can make a reliable distinction between good
and bad data under calima conditions in particular. Instead,
we adopt a more rigorous and robust Bayesian mixturemodel approach (e.g. Hogg, Bovy, & Lang 2010) to identify
those data points that lie close enough to the daily linear
extinction law to be considered reliable, and to distinguish
them from a separate background population of outliers that
do not. For this purpose we introduce a discrete classifier qi
which takes the value 0 for a good (“foreground”) observation, and 1 for a “background” outlier.
The extinction model yields the likelihood that a single
measurement yi = m60 (xi ) was obtained in good (i.e. qi = 0)
conditions:

Saharan dust conditions known as calima. The extinction coefficient and transparency fluctuations are high, but the spatial variations
in extinction are smooth enough to yield reliable velocities except when scattered clouds cause severe decreases in flux.

In the present application, the prior Q can be thought
of as the fraction of all observations obtained on a given
day that belong to the foreground (“good”) population. It is
a quantity that must be derived from the data themselves,
because weather conditions change from day to day.
We sample from the distribution described by Eq. 9

the values of p(yi |xi, σi, θ, qi = 0) and p(yi |xi, σi, θ, qi = 1) for
each sample for later use. This allows us to estimate the
conditional foreground probabilities marginalised over the

velocities of the observations classified as having mixture
probabilities greater than 0.9 of being “good” (blue) show a
much lower point-to-point scatter than those with lower mixture probabilities (cyan, green, yellow, red). This confirms
that the mixture-model approach is successful, and that a
threshold probability of about 0.9 is appropriate for detecting and filtering out observations with anomalous extinction
high enough to bias the radial-velocity measurements.
The prior probability distributions for the parameters
are listed in Table 1. To ensure orthogonality between the
fiducial magnitude θ 1 = m60 ( x̂) and the extinction coefficient θ 2 = k60 , we subtract the inverse variance-weighted
mean airmass x̂ from all airmass values, and the corresponding fiducial magnitude m60 ( x̂) from all magnitude values.
The extinction coefficient was allowed to vary between 0.075
mag/airmass, which represents a transparency slightly better than is encountered in any of the 904 daily datasets examined, and 0.4 mag/airmass, representing the worst transparency encountered in calima conditions that can still yield
a meaningful airmass plot. Short-term transparency fluctuations with a standard deviation as great as 0.08 mag/airmass
are allowed in the foreground population; anything worse
than this is likely to give differential extinction across the
solar disc bad enough to distort the radial velocity measurements. The mean of the background outlier population was
determined to be up to 0.8 magnitude fainter than the daily
mean, with a standard deviation between 0.1 and 0.7 magnitudes. The quality of a given daily sequence is not known
a priori, so the prior probability Q that any given data point
belongs to the foreground population is allowed to vary between 0.0 and 1.0.
Because the parameters are very close to being mutually
orthogonal, we used an MCMC scheme employing a simple
Metropolis-Hastings sampler. Two initial burn-in phases of
104 samples were employed. At the end of each, the standard
deviation of the parameter values was determined from the
last 103 steps to ensure better mixing in the next stage. A
third production phase of 104 steps yielded the posterior
samples used to determine the daily extinction coefficients
and to calculate the foreground membership probabilities
for the individual data points. Median values of these samples are listed in machine-readable form in Appendix A, Table A1. The mixture probabilities from Eq. 10 provide clear
thresholds against which the user can partition usable from
unusable data, and are used as quality flags in Appendix B,
Table B1.

Differential extinction corrections

The daily mean extinction coefficient defines the vertical extinction gradient across the diameter of the solar disk as
a function of airmass. This gradient affects the measured
solar radial velocity whenever the solar rotation axis is inclined relative to the vertical direction. This generally leads
to a spurious redshift in the morning, when the approaching
hemisphere of the Sun is lower in the sky than the receding
hemisphere. The effect was first identified and corrected by
Deming et al. (1987), and has subsequently been modelled
by the BiSON team (Davies et al. 2014). The analytic apMNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

proach we adopt here was developed independently of, and is
slightly different from, these previous studies, but the results
obtained are essentially identical.
The difference in airmass X between the upper and
lower limbs of the Sun is
δX = Xupper − Xlower

(13)

where X = sec z[1 − 0.0012(sec2 z − 1)] (Young & Irvine 1967).
The zenith angles zlower,upper = z ± sin−1 (R /d ) depend on
the zenith angle z of the solar centre, the solar radius R
and the Earth-Sun distance d at the time of observation.
The corresponding difference in magnitudes of atmospheric extinction is δm60 = k60 δX/2 across the solar radius. We define a fractional difference in brightness  '
δm60 ln 10/2.5, with  = 0 at the centre of the solar disc.
The angle between the solar rotation pole and the local
vertical is φ = P A − q, where P A is the position angle of
the solar rotation axis relative to the north celestial pole at
the time of observation. The parallactic angle q is the angle
subtended at the Sun by the celestial pole and the zenith,
giving

For a linear limb-darkening law with limb darkening
coefficient u, the form of the rotation profile in the absence
of differential extinction is (Gray 1992):
f (x) =

dy,

(16)

where the brightness is I(x,py) = 1 − u + uµ(x, y) and the foreshortening cosine µ(x, y) ≡ 1 − x 2 − y 2 .
The orthogonal Cartesian coordinates x and y are in the
directions of increasing solar rotation velocity and the solar
north pole respectively in the plane of the sky. For solidbody rotation with equatorial velocity veq , the brightnessweighted correction to the solar radial velocity is

(17)

In the absence of differential extinction across the rotation
profile, the integrand in the numerator of Eq. 17 is an odd
function, so the brightness-weighted velocity offset is zero.
We modify the calculation of the limb-darkened rotation
profile to include such a density gradient, parameterised by
the fractional extinction difference  across the solar radius.
A brightness gradient of uniform slope  in x and y at an
angle φ to the local vertical modifies the rotation profile in

has the analytic solution δvc = 0.376991 − 0.273631u for any
linear extinction gradient across the solar disc. Since there
is no dependence on either  or φ, the extinction gradient
across the convective velocity pattern does not produce any
change in radial velocity with either airmass or position angle. We therefore treat the effect of the centre-to-limb variation in convective velocity as a time-invariant offset to the
velocity zero-point, and evaluate the integrals in Eqs. 22 and
24 to obtain

Here ψ is the position angle between ecliptic north and the

relative to celestial north at the Sun is given by

where ε is the 23.4-degree obliquity of the ecliptic and α is
the solar RA at the time of observation. By analogy with
the position angle of the solar rotation pole, ψ = PAecl − q
where q is the parallactic angle. The integration is specified
separately in Eq. 24 in a Cartesian coordinate system in
which y is oriented toward the ecliptic north pole and x is
in the direction of Earth’s orbital motion. The solution has
the same form as Eq. 19 with veq replaced by −R ωorb .

Both I(x, y) and vconv (µ(x, y)) are azimuthally-symmetric
functions of radius only. The contribution of c(x, φ) to δvr in
Eq. 24 is therefore independent of  and φ, being a constant
that depends on the radial variations in limb darkening and
convective velocity only. To illustrate this point by way of
example, we approximate the centre-to-limb dependence of
the line-of-sight convective velocity as a sigmoidal function
with the form

So far we have assumed that the solar photosphere rotates as a solid body, ignoring the effects of differential rotation, axial inclination and centre-to-limb variations in convective blueshift. Reiners et al. (2016) modelled the effects
of these modifications to the solar rotation profile on the solar radial velocity in the presence of an extinction gradient.
Following their example, we can include differential rotation
in our model by allowing the apparent rotational angular
frequency ωobs to vary as a function of heliographic latitude
b. This alters eq. 17 such that the intrinsic solar equatorial rotation speed veq is replaced by R ωrot (x, y). We adopt
the sidereal differential rotation law of Snodgrass & Ulrich
(1990) as a function of heliographic latitude b, defining

The velocity correction for differential extinction varies
almost linearly with airmass, and has an amplitude of 2 to 3
m s−1 in an uninterrupted day’s observations. As cos i varies
through the year, the values of δvr depart by only 1 or 2
mm s−1 from the solid-body rotation values obtained using
a sidereal rotation rate ωsid = 2.875 × 10−6 rad s−1 . The inclination dependence involves only even powers of cos i, and
does not change sign when the Earth crosses the solar equator.
The radial-velocity plots in the lower-left panels of
Figs. 2, 3 and 4 have all been corrected for this effect, using Eq. 29 with u = 0.6. The full set of extinction-corrected
instrumental radial velocities are plotted in Fig. 7 for the
duration of the observing campaign to date.

Intra-day solar radial-velocity variability

Phillips et al. (2016) have shown that the 5-minute solar
p-mode oscillations are clearly detected in sequences of 20s exposures taken as part of the science verification programme for the HARPS-N solar telescope. Although the 5minute exposures used in the longer-term study reported
MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

Sun-as-a-star radial-velocity observations

here are designed to suppress these oscillations, the daily
radial-velocity traces in the lower-left panels of Figs. 2 and
3 show that short-term correlated noise is still present. The
daily RMS scatter shown in the upper panel of Fig. 5 is
nonetheless only slightly greater than the 0.43 m s−1 estimated uncertainty on a single radial-velocity measurement
in conditions of good transparency. This agrees well with
early results studied by Dumusque et al. (2015).
To ensure that the correlated noise is not caused by
variable atmospheric transparency in calima conditions, in
the lower panel of Fig. 5 we plot the same values against
the daily extinction coefficient. Calima is characterised by
values of k60 in the approximate range from 0.15 to 0.40
magnitudes per airmass. No dependence of the daily RMS
scatter on extinction coefficient is apparent.
To obtain the autocorrelation function of the Sun on
minutes-to-hours timescales in the quietest possible conditions, we selected the period from 2018 July 21-October 12.
Daily SDO magnetograms show that six weak or decaying
bipolar magnetic regions crossed the centre of the solar disc
during this period. These disc-centre crossings are marked
by blue arrows in the upper panel of Fig. 6. We estimated
the RMS scatter of the individual 5-minute radial-velocity
measurements under these quiet-Sun conditions by taking
all days on which we obtained more than 4 hours’ data (48
observations) with mixture probabilities (cf. Eq. 10) greater
than 99 percent. Within each day we applied an iterative
4-sigma clip to remove very occasional outlying RV meaMNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

surements with causes other than transparency fluctuations,
which had not been rejected by the mixture modelling.
Even during periods when no discernible magnetic regions are present, the day-to-day scatter of the radial velocities greatly exceeds the intra-day scatter. The BIS and
FWHM, however, display day-to-day scatter no greater than
their daily averages. HARPS-N observations entail comprehensive daily calibration sequences. These establish the geometry for the extraction of the spectral orders from the

10

A. Collier Cameron et al.

CCD frames, and the wavelength dispersion relation for the
extracted spectra. The accuracy of the zero point of the radial velocities therefore depends on the accuracy of the daily
calibration. Our results indicate that the zero-point accuracy
of the daily calibrations is very similar to the 0.4 m s−1 RMS
scatter measured by Dumusque (2018) in HARPS data reduced with the same version of the DRS used to extract
and calibrate the solar spectra. We conclude that the daily
jumps in the RV are likely to be a data-reduction artifact.
To eliminate the effects of day-to-day calibration zeropoint errors and any residual rotationally-modulated stellar
activity, we subtracted the daily mean from each day’s RV
measurements. The resulting set of velocities is plotted in the
middle panel of Fig. 6. The autocorrelation function (ACF)
of these data was computed using the method of Edelson
& Krolik (1988), and is plotted in the lower panel of the
same figure. For comparison, the ACF of white noise with
the same variance, sampled at the same times, is also shown.
The ACF confirms clearly that the radial velocities are
strongly correlated, with a correlation half-life close to 15
minutes. This is somewhat longer than the average lifetime
of a solar granule. The radial velocities become effectively
uncorrelated for time lags longer than about 0.07 day (1.7
hours).
The 5-minute cadence of the observations is designed to
suppress short-term variability caused by the solar 5-minute
p-mode oscillations. For stellar observations, the HARPS
and HARPS-N Rocky Planet-Search projects use 2 or 3 exposures of at least 15 minutes, spaced at least 2 or 3 hours
apart. The 15-minute exposure mitigates the effects of pmode oscillations, and the 2 to 3-hour sample spacing ensures that granulation noise is effectively uncorrelated (Dumusque et al. 2011; Meunier et al. 2015). The autocorrelation
properties of the HARPS-N solar data illustrate the need for
such a strategy.

CORRECTIONS FOR SOLAR-SYSTEM
DYNAMICS
Solar barycentric motion

The radial velocities derived from the solar spectra are processed using the same HARPS-N Data Reduction System
that is employed for night-time observations. The exposureweighted mid-time of each exposure is converted from UTC
to Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical
Time standard, and the radial velocity is transformed to the
reference frame of the solar-system barycentre. For both calculations, the apparent J2000 position of the centre of the
Sun replaces conventional J2000 stellar coordinates.
When the target is the Sun, the use of the Barycentric
Julian Date remains valid to within 2 or 3 seconds. The
radial velocity, however, represents the component of the
Sun’s barycentric motion in the direction of the observer, in
this case HARPS-N at the TNG. The raw radial velocities
thus comprise the radial component of the total solar reflex
motion induced by the planets. The sum of these motions
is clearly seen in Fig. 7 as a sinusoidal variation with an
amplitude of 12 m s−1 and a period close to 13 months. This
is the synodic period of Jupiter observed from Earth.
To eliminate this reflex motion, we transform the radial

velocities to the heliocentric system, using the JPL Horizons
ephemeris (Giorgini et al. 1996) to obtain the component of
the Sun’s barycentric motion in the direction of the TNG.
This is subtracted from the raw velocities, reducing the observed velocities to a reference frame in which the rate of
change of distance of the solar centre from the TNG is zero.
The resulting radial velocities are shown in the lower panel
of Fig. 7. The average observed velocity of 102 m s−1 includes the instrumental zero point, the solar gravitational
redshift and the granular convective blueshift, and agrees
with the mean values determined by Molaro et al. (2013)
and Haywood et al. (2016) using HARPS on the ESO 3.6-m
telescope within 2 m s−1 .

rotationally modulated in exoplanet host stars with moderate to high levels of stellar activity (Queloz et al. 2009).

constructed with the Bayesian Generalised Lomb-Scargle

where e is the Earth’s orbital eccentricity, P ⊕ is the orbital
period and r(t)/a ⊕ is the Earth-Sun separation at time t

The variation in v sin i with time is straightforward
to calculate given the Cartesian ecliptic direction vector
ω̂ of the solar rotation pole and the instantaneous SunEarth direction vector r̂ ⊕ in ecliptic coordinates, since sin i =
p
1 − (ω̂ .r̂ ⊕ )2 . The correction needed to recover the value of
the FWHM that would be observed in the sidereal reference
frame is, however, less straightforward. The observed CCF
can be considered as the convolution of a limb-darkened rotation profile with the CCF that would be obtained for a hypothetical non-rotating star. For the purposes of this study
we treat the observed FWHM Fobs as the quadrature sum
of the intrinsic linewidth F0 and an unknown fraction γ of
the observed v sin i, such that

These additional modulations are of dynamical origin.
The solar apparent equatorial velocity is v sin i = R ωobs sin i,
where i is the inclination of the solar rotation axis to the
line of sight. The solar apparent angular velocity ωobs is
the difference between the solar sidereal angular velocity ω
and the instantaneous orbital angular velocity ω ⊕ (t) of the
observer. The Earth’s orbital eccentricity imposes an annual

We find that the RMS scatter in the resulting values of Fsid
is minimised for γ = 1.04. Using this value we plot the corrected FWHM in the sidereal frame in Fig. 9. To first order,
the CCF profile is the convolution of a local line profile with
a stellar rotation profile of unit area, re-normalised to the
resulting continuum level. So long as the area of the local
line profile does not change strongly between facular and
quiet-Sun areas, and the centre-to-limb variation in the area
of the local line profile is small, the area W of the CCF will
remain approximately constant even when parts of the stellar disc are occupied by dark spots or bright faculae. The
area of the fitted profile is thus proportional to the product
of the FWHM and the contrast, so Csid Fsid = Cobs Fobs gives
the corresponding correction to the contrast.

LINE-PROFILE BEHAVIOUR ON THE
APPROACH TO SOLAR MINIMUM

When corrected to the sidereal reference frame, the FWHM
of the solar CCF shows a barely significant increase over the
duration of the study. Dumusque (2018) found a similar slow
change in the FWHM for HARPS, which they attributed
to long-term changes in the focus of the instrument. The
FWHM shows strong short-term variability, however, and
peaks strongly at the times when one or more major spot
groups are near the centre of the disk (Fig. 9, top two panels;
SILSO World Data Centre 2015–2018; Clette et al. 2016).
The Bisector Inverse Slope, plotted in the third panel of
Fig. 9, exhibits a secular decline over the three years of observation amassed to date, with a shorter modulation clearly
seen at the solar rotation period and its first harmonic. Although it is likely that the BIS will be affected to some extent
by the modulation of the solar v sin i, Fig. 9 shows that it is
not the dominant signal.

12

A. Collier Cameron et al.
This long-term trend is mirrored in the area of the Gaussian fit to the CCF, plotted in the bottom panel of Fig. 9.

gridlines denote calendar-year boundaries.

Long-term trends

Early in the sequence the BIS shows rapid oscillations, as
might be expected if multiple active regions cross the disc
during every solar rotation. Underlying the peaks associated
with disc-centre passages of large magnetic regions, the BIS
exhibits a long-term downward trend. This trend appears to
mirror the general decline in sunspot number over the same
period.
The CCF area shows a corresponding secular increase
over the three years of observation amassed to date. This increase is not seen in the FWHM, so cannot be attributed to,
for example, a long-term change in spectrograph focus. On
shorter timescales of order weeks to months, the FWHM is
anticorrelated with the CCF contrast. The CCF area, being
the product of the contrast and the FWHM, does not therefore contain a strong rotational signal. The secular increase
in the CCF area thus appears to be driven by a slow increase
in the CCF contrast. This might happen if, for instance,
the relative contributions of the blue and red echelle orders
were changing slowly with time, as might happen through
uncorrected ageing of a calibration lamp’s colour temperature. We can rule out this possibility because the HARPS-N
data-reduction system corrects the blaze function and normalises the continuum level in all orders before computing
the CCF, with the explicit purpose of preventing such chromatic imbalances.
The trends in both the area and the BIS are interrupted temporarily at approximately BJD 2457850.0, and
resume from their new levels from about BJD 2457900.0
(Fig. 9). This interruption coincides with the appearance of
the large, persistent bipolar active regions mentioned above
(AR12653 and AR12654 in late 2017 March, then AR12674
and AR12675 early in 2017 September), following a lengthy
period of low activity. From late 2017 onward, the decline
toward solar minimum resumed, with few spot groups visible.
At face value, a secular increase in the equivalent widths
of the thousands of spectral lines that contribute to the CCF
area gives the appearance of a global decrease in the stellar
effective temperature. The area of the CCF represents a reliable proxy of the temperature and metallicity of a star, as
demonstrated by Malavolta et al. (2017). Under the reasonable assumption that the Sun did not change its metallicity
during the three years spanning our observations, we can use
the CCF area to track global temperature changes in the
photosphere of the Sun. The correlation with the BIS suggests that the trends are also associated with a change in line
asymmetry, and hence with changes in either the magnetic
field (Brandt & Solanki 1990; Meunier et al. 2017) or the
flux effect due to dark spots (Meunier, Desort, & Lagrange
2010; Haywood et al. 2016).
Unlike the BIS, however, the CCF area shows little
evidence of rotational modulation. This lack of rotational
modulation suggests that the structures responsible for the
change in CCF area are axisymmetrically distributed over
the solar surface. We speculate that the CCF area may be
tracing the evolution of the solar magnetic network, which
largely comprises dispersed magnetic flux elements from deMNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

Short-term line-profile variability

The FWHM and the BIS both peak strongly at times when
major sunspot groups and their accompanying bipolar magnetic regions cross the solar disc for the first time. Unlike the
FWHM, however, the BIS shows a persistent periodic signal
at the solar rotation period for about 3 rotations following
the first passage of each major new spot group.
This behaviour is particularly apparent following the
appearance of the pair of large bipolar solar active regions
AR12654 and AR12655, which crossed the solar disc centre near JD 2457845.5 (2017 March 30). One rotation later,
these regions had decayed to the extent that only remnants
of the leading spots are visible in continuum images from
SDO/HMI 1 . The SDO/HMI magnetograms, however, show
that the bipolar fields from these active regions persisted for
a further 3 or 4 rotations.
The same behaviour is seen following disc centre passage
of the large bipolar regions AR12674 and AR12675 near JD
2458002.5 (2017 September 5). These same two spot groups
survived to cross disc centre one Carrington rotation later
on 2017 October 1, when they produced secondary peaks in
both the FWHM and the BIS. A third “echo” of this event
appears strongly in the BIS plot (Fig. 9) after a further
Carrington rotation, even though the spots themselves had

cayed active regions being swept up towards the poles by
meridional circulation. As the activity cycle declines, the
supply of flux elements to the network decreases, reducing
localised facular brightening and giving the appearance of a
decreased effective temperature.
A decline in network flux also increases the dominance
of the asymmetric quiet-Sun pattern of granular line asymmetry (e.g. Cegla et al. 2013). The changes in line asymmetry measured by the BIS show both the long-term trend seen
in the CCF area and a rotationally-modulated component
that responds to the visibility of the facular magnetic fields
of large bipolar regions.
The connection between the effective temperature and
the coverage of activity regions and network is not yet fully
explored, but the solar data already offer some useful insights. The visibility of the more strongly RV-suppressive
facular magnetic-field concentrations in SDO images has
been found to be a stronger predictor of the solar radial
velocity than the total visible-hemisphere coverage of activeregion and network field elements (Milbourne et al. 2019).
Milbourne et al. (2019) find the filling factor of the small,
weakly RV-suppressive magnetic areas that they label “network” to be greater (and around solar minimum, much
greater) than the filling factor of the more strongly RVsuppressive faculae. If the CCF area is sensitive to the temperature contrast and filling factor of network/faculae in the
optical, changes in the CCF area will mostly be driven by
the slow, small, long-term variation of network rather than
the much less dominant (by area) faculae. The BIS, on the
other hand is sensitive to velocity suppression, so it would
see both the long-term changes (due to changes in network
and facular area) and the short term effects of rotationally
modulated faculae.

almost disappeared. SDO magnetograms taken on 2017 October 28 show that the bipolar magnetic regions associated
with these groups are still very much present.
The coincidence of strong, isolated peaks in the FWHM
time series with similarly isolated peaks in the sunspot number, and the greater observed persistence of the BIS signal
for several rotations after the emergence of each new active
region suggests strongly that the FWHM responds to dark
spots while the line asymmetry measured by the BIS traces

this observation on a more quantitative footing we computed the autocorrelation functions of the timeseries data
in RV, FWHM, BIS and CCF area. For each time series, we
took the daily median value and time of observation, and
subtracted a linear trend in time. We used the method of
Edelson & Krolik (1988) to obtain the ACF of the resulting
irregularly-sampled timeseries, with a bin width of 2 days.
The results are presented in Fig. 10, for time lags from 0
to 150 days. The BIS shows the most persistent periodicity,

Active-region BIS signal and radial velocity

As discussed above, the BIS shows a secular trend mirroring
the smooth long-term change in the CCF area. To isolate the
rotational signal in the BIS we decorrelated the BIS against
the CCF area. The residual BIS signal exhibits annual and
six-month periodicities similar to those seen in the FWHM
(Fig. 11). We fitted out these periodicities using sinusoids
with periods of 6 months and 1 year, whose phases and amplitudes are to be treated as free parameters. The corrected
BIS signal is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 11.
Periodograms of the daily median RV and de-trended
BIS time series bear a close resemblance to each other
(Fig. 12). Both periodograms are dominated by the solar
rotation period and its first harmonic.

and BIS in fig. 9 and the evidence described above that the
oscillatory part of the BIS tracks the active-region facular
filling factor, it is tempting to infer that the BIS will be a
good proxy indicator of the radial velocity. Fig. 13, however,
shows that the two are almost entirely uncorrelated.
This lack of correlation arises from the temporal behaviour of the RV and the line-profile parameters. Fig. 14
shows the sunspot number, corrected FWHM, radial velocity and uncorrected BIS during the period between 16 June
and 3 November 2017, when a number of large, relatively
isolated active regions crossed an otherwise quiet Sun. Close
inspection of this figure, and of the discrete cross-correlation
functions (Edelson & Krolik 1988) in Fig. 15, reveals that
the maxima in radial velocity occur 1 to 3 days before the
maxima in FWHM and BIS respectively. Given that each
peak has a width of about 7 days, this temporal offset between the RV and BIS weakens the correlation.
Similar temporal shifts between maxima in the RV, BIS,
FWHM and chromospheric Ca II H&K emission flux have
been reported for other intensively-observed stars such as
GJ674 (Bonfils et al. 2007), GJ176 (Forveille et al. 2009),
CoRoT-7 (Queloz et al. 2009) and HD41428 (Santos et al.
2014). While the authors of these papers generally attribute
the phase lags in these cases to the RV signal being dominated by dark spots, the HARPS-N solar data indicate that
the same phenomenon is present even when the RV signal is
dominated by facular suppression of the convective blueshift
(Meunier, Desort, & Lagrange 2010; Haywood et al. 2016).
It is also worth noting that HD41248 is an inactive G2V star,
so the observation by Santos et al. (2014) that increases in
RV precede increases in FWHM by 2-3 days is consistent
with the solar behaviour, i.e., facular, not spot, dominated
RV variations.
The reasons for this temporal offset between the RV and
the line-profile parameters are subtle but important. The
FWHM is expected to increase when a dark sunspot group
crosses the centre of the solar disc. This phenomenon is well
known from Doppler imaging of starspots (Vogt & Penrod
1983): when the missing light from a dark spot crosses the
stellar rotation profile, it reduces the depth of the centre
of the normalised line profile while approximately preserving the area (subject to any centre-to-limb variation in the
area of the local CCF). The width of the line must thereMNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

fore increase to compensate. The lack of persistence seen in
the FWHM in Figs. 9 and 10 supports an association of the
FWHM with dark spots rather than the longer-lived surrounding magnetic regions.
In the absence of granular convection, we might expect
the BIS to track the first derivative of the FWHM as the
spectral signatures of dark spots cross the line profile from
blue to red. Such an effect may be present at a low level,
but in reality the BIS peaks only slightly later than the
FWHM when an active region crosses disc centre. As noted
above, the BIS peaks repeat for 3 or 4 solar rotations after
the initial appearance of a large, isolated active region, even
after the spots themselves have dispersed. This supports an
association of the line asymmetry (quantified by the BIS)
with the suppression of granular convection in the stronglymagnetic, bright facular regions that are the longer-lived
counterparts of bipolar sunspot groups.
The close connection proposed by Meunier, Desort, &
Lagrange (2010) between the solar radial velocity and magnetic suppression of granular convection has been confirmed
observationally by Haywood et al. (2016) and Milbourne et
al. (2019). The temporal offset between the RV and BIS
signatures thus appears all the more surprising, until we
consider how the measurements are actually made.
The cause of these temporal offsets was discussed by
Dumusque, Boisse, & Santos (2014) and is illustrated in
their Figure 6. The HARPS-N DRS determines radial velocities by fitting a Gaussian to the CCF and recording the
location of the peak. The CCF profile represents the convolution of many different local line profiles with the limbdarkened stellar rotation profile. As discussed above, a dark
spot crossing the disc creates a disturbance to the CCF that
is symmetric in time about disc-centre crossing if the CCF
profile itself is reasonably symmetric. If we now replace the
dark spot with a highly-simplified active-region CCF which
contributes similar total flux but whose line profile is displaced redward by suppression of convective blueshift, the
net effect is to add a travelling perturbation whose form resembles the first derivative of the local line profile. Being
antisymmetric, this disturbance influences the Gaussian fit,

and hence the measured radial velocity, in a way that is not
symmetric about disc-centre passage.
For a slowly-rotating star like the Sun, the rotation profile is narrower than the intrinsic linewidth. When the active
region is on the approaching hemisphere, the disturbance
weakens the blue wing of the CCF and moves the core redward. When the active region is at disc centre, the core of
the line moves redward. When on the receding hemisphere,
the disturbance boosts the red wing of the profile and weakens the blue side of the core. The displacement of the centre
of the fitted Gaussian is therefore always redward, but is not
necessarily symmetric about the time of disc-centre passage.
The time lags between the maxima of the RV, the BIS and
the FWHM thus depend crucially on the details of changes
to the local line asymmetry that occur as the active region
crosses the disc.
There is another effect that could introduce time delays
between different activity indicators. Strong, mostly vertical
(buoyant) magnetic fields inhibit, in particular, flows perpendicular to them. These however, are not visible at disc
centre. Their area and limb darkened visiblity peaks ∼ 40
degrees off disc centre. This leads to a natural phase offset
between BIS (which is more affected by magnetic inhibition
of velocities, peaking away from from disk center, and suppressed relative to local quiet Sun) and FWHM (which is
more affected by thermal variations, peaking at disc centre). One implication is that the lag would then be, at least
in part, a function of the rotation period.
Figure 14 also shows that at times when the Sun is
quiet, the day-to-day scatter in the FWHM and BIS is comparable to the intra-day scatter. The same is not true of the
radial velocity, which shows an additional day-to-day scatter
of order 0.4 m s−1 . The most likely source of this additional
scatter is lack of repeatability in the daily calibrations used
to establish the order locations and wavelength dispersion
relations for the 2-D spectra.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Three years of radial-velocity monitoring the Sun as a
star with the HARPS-N instrument reveal variability on
timescales ranging from minutes to days to years.
Within a single day, the radial-velocity signal is strongly
correlated on timescales of minutes to hours. We find that
15-minute integrations attenuate the autocorrelation amplitude of the data by a factor 2 or so better than 5-minute sampling. The same autocorrelation analysis shows that samples
taken 2 or more hours apart are effectively statistically independent. This supports the recommendations of the earlier
study of the impact of stellar granulation by Dumusque et
al. (2011), whose conclusions have determined the nightly
observing strategy of surveys for terrestrial-mass planets
around bright stars with HARPS and HARPS-N.
Finally, the solar data reveal a need for more sophisticated data-reduction strategies. High-precision instruments
such as HARPS-N require comprehensive daily calibration
sequences to monitor the long-term stability of the instrument. No calibration is perfect, however, and the solar data
reveal radial-velocity zero-point errors with an RMS scatter of order 0.4 m s−1 . These arise mainly from day-today zero-point uncertainty in the daily wavelength calibraMNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)

Sun-as-a-star radial-velocity observations
tions carried out by the version of the pipeline with which
these data were reduced. A recent major upgrade to the
HARPS/HARPS-N data-reduction system has introduced a
better-constrained 2-dimensional fit across all échelle orders
into these daily calibrations for stellar data. Improvements
can therefore be expected in future data releases from this
project, once the 58000 existing solar spectra and future observations have been reprocessed.
Long-term changes in the area of the CCF appear to
arise from cycle-related changes in the magnetic network.
There is no rotational modulation component to this signal,
and the impact on the radial velocity is not yet fully clear.
There appears to be no strong trend in RV over the three
years of this study, but we caution that we have not yet had
the opportunity to observe the full range of activity in a
solar cycle.
The long-term evolution of the BIS, which measures
the core-wing asymmetry of the CCF, has a baseline which
mirrors the long-term evolution of the CCF area. Bipolar
magnetic active regions passing across the solar disk cause
perturbations lasting several days in both the radial velocity
and the CCF profile parameters. The line-shape parameters
of the CCF appear to respond to different components of
the active regions. The FWHM shows modulation behaviour
that tracks the sunspot number. The BIS shows more persistently repetitive modulation, suggesting that the line asymmetry responds primarily to disruption of the photospheric
granulation pattern in the faculae, which are the longestlived components of active regions.
There is no single proxy indicator that can recover the
RV from an isolated measurement of the line-profile shape or
other activity indicators without reference to time-domain
information. Given that active regions in solar-type stars
evolve on timescales comparable to the rotation period, it is
therefore mandatory to sample stellar radial-velocity signals
often enough that active-region passages can be fully characterised in all proxy indicators. The radial velocity tracks the
BIS closely, but the BIS lags the radial velocity by about 3
days. As Figs. 14 and 15 show, these time lags are large
enough that a simple linear decorrelation against BIS or
FWHM cannot be used to correct the radial velocity for the
effects of magnetic activity. A more sophisticated approach
which uses time-domain information as well as line-shape
information is needed. Although such a treatment is beyond
the scope of this paper, we refer the reader to recent papers
by Aigrain, Pont, & Zucker (2012), Rajpaul et al. (2015) and
Jones et al. (2017). These multivariate Gaussian-process regression approaches use temporal derivative models of RV
proxy indicators in a general way that has strong potential
capability to model such time lags.

(4) Heliocentric RV in km s−1 ;
(5) Heliocentric RV in km s−1 , corrected for differential extinction;
(6) RV error in km s−1 ;
(7) Observed CCF FWHM in km s−1 ;
(8) Sidereal CCF FWHM in km s−1 , corrected for Earth orbital motion and solar obliquity;
(9) CCF contrast (percent);
(10) Observed CCF BIS in km s−1 ;
(11) Apparent hour angle in radians;
(12) Apparent Airmass;
(13) Pseudo-magnitude derived from SNR in order 60;
(14) Magnitude error derived from SNR in order 60;
