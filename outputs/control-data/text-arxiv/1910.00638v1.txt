Abstract. With a view toward describing reactions of intermediatemass nuclei from first principles, we present first results for the norm
and Hamiltonian overlaps (kernels) for the p-α, p-16 O and p-20 Ne cluster
systems using realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions. This is achieved in
the framework of a new ab initio approach that combines the symmetryadapted no-core shell model (SA-NCSM) with the resonating group method
(RGM). In this model, a physically relevant basis based on the SU(3)
symmetry is used. The structure of the clusters is provided by the ab
initio SA-NCSM, which enables the description of spatially enhanced nuclear configurations and heavier nuclei, by exploiting symmetries known
to dominate in nuclei. Here, we discuss the applicability and efficacy of
this approach.

Introduction. – Ab initio descriptions of reactions of nuclei heavier than
16
O remain a challenge in nuclear physics. Their theoretical and experimental
study is of utmost importance to identify various quantum mechanisms that can
explain the complexity of nuclei. In addition, many simulations of astrophysical phenomena are very sensitive to nuclear reaction cross sections. For example,
simulations of X-ray burst nucleosynthesis have been found to be sensitive to several nuclear reaction rates for intermediate- and medium-mass nuclei [1], pointing
to the need for accurate cross sections. For theoretical predictions, this level of
accuracy can be achieved through an ab initio description of nuclear reactions.
Recent progresses in ab initio nuclear theory using QCD-inspired realistic interactions along with the continuous improvement of high performance computing
have given the necessary tools to theoretical approaches such as the no-core shell
model (NCSM) to provide an ab initio description of the structure of light nuclei
[2,3]. Its recent implementation within the RGM [4], the NCSM/RGM, has allowed a microscopic study of nuclear reactions [5,6,7], pursuing the long-standing
goal of unifying nuclear structure and reactions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the SA-NCSM [8,9], which employs a physically relevant basis, can
use drastically reduced configuration spaces with practically the same accuracy

of results, and has been successfully applied up to medium-mass nuclei [10,11].
Motivated by the need for calculated nuclear cross sections in experimental research and astrophysical studies, and following the success of the NCSM/RGM
for light nuclei, we combine the SA-NCSM with the RGM. As a first step, we
focus on reactions of two clusters, in which the projectile is a nucleon.
Ab initio symmetry-adapted framework for nuclear reactions. – In
the RGM framework, the nucleons are organized within different groups, or
clusters, “resonating” through the intercluster exchange of nucleons. This antisymmetrization between the different clusters guarantees the Pauli exclusion
principle, which, along with the consideration of the cluster internal structure, is
one of the most important features of the approach. In the case of two clusters,
the wave function is written as (in notations of Ref. [6]):

projectile for all channels ν, and the cross section can be extracted from their

as hΦJν 0 rT0 | ÂÔÂ |ΦJνr T i with Ô being the identity and the Hamiltonian operator,
respectively, and where Â is the antisymmetrizer ensuring the Pauli exclusion
principle. The kernels are computed using the wave functions of the clusters. Eq.
(2) can then be solved using an R-matrix approach [12,13].
An ab initio application of this approach is the NCSM/RGM [6], which uses
NCSM wave functions and realistic interactions. However, the method becomes
numerically challenging for heavier systems due to the size and complexity of
the configuration space. We address the limitation of the NCSM/RGM by combining the SA-NCSM with the RGM formalism, where the former allows for the
calculation of the intermediate mass wavefunctions required by the RGM.
In the SA-NCSM, the microscopic many-body basis is based on the spherical
harmonic oscillator single-particle basis, and labeled by irreducible representations according to the group chain:
SU(3)(λµ) ⊃ SO(3)L ⊃ SO(2)ML .

Consequently, for any given total spin J and its projection M , the wave function
of a nucleus will be described within a basis {|αi (λi µi )κi (Li Si )JM i} with each
component weighted by a coefficient Ci . Here αi represents additional quantum
numbers needed to enumerate the complete shell-model space.
In the SA-RGM, the channels are defined by coupling each component of the
SA-NCSM wave functions between the projectile and the target. Consequently,
the channels with good SU(3) spin and isospin quantum numbers are given in
the case of one nucleon projectile as:

where the index γ ≡ {α1 (λ1 µ1 )S1 T1 ; (n0) 21 12 } labels the channel basis, with (n0)
representing the SU(3) labels of the projectile with spin 21 and isospin 12 . Note
that there is no dependence on the orbital momentum of the target and the
projectile.
In this basis, the exchange matrix, which ensures the antisymmetrization in
the kernels, has the following form (in conventional notations [16]):

Clearly, the presence of the delta Kronecker functions in Eq.(5) makes the exchange matrix diagonal within this SU(3) basis, allowing for several numerical simplifications [17]. Furthermore, matrix calculations avoid complications of
dealing with the orbital momentum, which is introduced at the very last step
of the calculation, for input to the R-matrix approach. Namely, we can retrieve

are more complicated and are omitted for brevity here.

Results. – To demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, we present results for
norm and Hamiltonian kernels for light and intermediate-mass nuclei.
SA-NCSM and SA-RGM computations are performed in laboratory coordinates. The center-of-mass (CM) spuriosity is removed for the target wave function. To simplify the calculations the present results are reported for a projectiletarget system with the CM included (the removal of the CM is work in progress
and is based on an efficient group-theoretical algorithm to be reported in another publication). Nonetheless, this CM effect is expected to be negligible for
reactions for one nucleon plus an A & 16 target, such as 16 O and 20 Ne.

kernel for p-16 O with the NNLOsat [18] interaction and p-20 Ne with the NNLOopt
[19] interaction (Fig. 2). As expected, the norm kernel vanishes at large distances,
which is consistent with the Pauli principle. Results are shown for a model space
for the projectile that yields convergence. Indeed, we find that the norm kernel
converges comparatively quickly for the NNLOsat interaction and, e.g., including
up to 4 shells has already yielded a converged norm kernel for p-16 O (Fig. 3).
The Hamiltonian kernel provides information on the non-local effective interaction between the projectile and the target for a given channel, and can be
studied for intermediate-mass targets in the SA-RGM framework. For example,
we find that the direct part of the Hamiltonian kernel for the p+20 Ne shows a
different behavior as compared to doubly-magic systems (Fig. 4, left panel). The
positive peaks occurring around r = 3 fm might be related to the intricate structure of 20 Ne that exhibits clustering substructures and enhanced deformation,
as shown in the density profile (Fig. 4, right panel). Further investigations of
these effective interactions in this region and the role of non-locality are needed,
especially in relation to obtaining first-principle optical potentials.
To summarize, the use of a physically relevant basis in the SA-RGM provides
a pathway to ab initio descriptions of nuclear reactions in the intermediatemass region. The use of this basis allows several numerical procedures inherent
to RGM to be simplified. The present outcome shows the applicability of the
method, including benchmark calculations, convergence properties, and a discussion of non-local inter-cluster effective interactions.
