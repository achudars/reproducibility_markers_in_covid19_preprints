Abstract
Describing partially-condensed Bose gases poses a long-standing theoretical challenge. We present
exact stochastic Ehrenfest relations for the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation, including both number and energy damping mechanisms, and all projector terms that arise from
the energy cutoff separating system from reservoir. We test the theory by applying it to the
centre of mass fluctuations of a harmonically trapped prolate system, finding close agreement
between c-field simulations and analytical results. The formalism lays the foundation to analytically explore experimentally accessible hot Bose-Einstein condensates.

Introduction

A system of Bose atoms with temperature T undergoes a dramatic change in behavior at the critical
temperature for the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), T c . Far below the BEC transition
T  T c , a nearly pure BEC forms, consisting of a highly occupied many-body quantum state; in this
regime dilute gas BEC are renowned both for their high experimental control, and precise theoretical
description [1]. At temperatures T  T c thermal energy dominates, the quantum statistics are unimportant, and a Boltzman description captures the physical properties of the atoms. When T ∼ T c the
quantum statistics of the atoms are decisive, despite appreciable thermal energy. In a hot BEC T . T c ,
competition between thermal and interaction effects leads to fragmentation of the condensate, and
formation of vortices, solitons, and phononic excitations. A cooling quench across the transition can
inject interesting excitations into the BEC that form as remnants of the broken U(1) symmetry [2, 3],
and rich turbulent dynamics develop from the competition between thermal, quantum, and interaction
effects, posing a challenge for theory.
At low temperatures that contain significant condensate and non-condensate fraction, mean field
theory provides a useful description, upon which the GPE and its generalizations are based. The
Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin U(1) symmetry breaking approach has proven well suited for practical calculations in this low-temperature regime [4], having the virtue that the interactions between condensate
and thermal cloud, and their respective dynamics, are all included in the dynamical description. However, it’s strength for low temperatures presents a limitation at high temperatures: despite notable successes, e.g. for collective modes [5], the symmetry-breaking ansatz has limited scope for describing
strongly fluctuating systems containing large non-condensate fraction. Fortunately, the scope of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) upon which ZNG is based goes much further than mean-field theory:
GPE-like field equations appear naturally in phase-space representations of Bose gases [6], suggesting
a generalization of quantum optical open systems theory [7] for describing hot Bose gases. Indeed,
various generalized Gross-Pitaevskii theories have been developed for the high temperature regime,
describing many modes that are weakly occupied, interacting, and partially coherent [8, 9]. Devoid of
the symmetry-breaking ansatz, these approaches have advantages for high-temperature work.
One approach capable of describing experiments across the phase transition is known as the
stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) [10–14]. The SPGPE was developed as a

synthesis of quantum kinetic theory [15] and the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation [16], and provides a tractable approach for numerical simulations of hot matter-wave dynamics that includes all
significant reservoir interaction processes. The SPGPE describes the evolution of a high-temperature
partially condensed system within a classical field approximation, is valid on either side of the critical
point, and has been used to quantitatively model the BEC phase transition [3], and BEC dynamics
observed in high-temperature experiments [17]. The complete SPGPE includes a number-damping
reservoir interaction (of Ginzburg-Landau type) described in previous works [3, 17], and an additional
interaction involving exchange of energy with the reservoir [2]; the latter is a number-conserving interaction that can in principle have a significant influence on dissipative evolution [9, 13, 18, 19], yet
due to technical challenges, its physical effects have thus far been largely unexplored.
Ehrenfest’s theorem [20] relates, for example, the time derivative of the expectation (with respect
to the wavefunction) of momentum and position of a particle with the potential experienced by the
particle. The Ehrenfest relations can be extended to the Gross-Pitaevskii fluid — essentially without
modification — due to the net cancellation of two-body interaction forces. Previously, development
of the number-damping SPGPE theory was aided by Ehrenfest relations [21]. Such relations for
ensemble averages provide an essential validity check for numerical work, and physical consistency
tests for the reservoir theory, including ensemble averages expected in equilibrium.
In this work we derive stochastic collective equations for the SPGPE including the effects of both
number-damping and energy-damping. These stochastic Ehrenfest relations (SERs) form the extension of Ehrenfest relations to finite-temperature stochastic field theory of Bose-Einstein condensates.
They extend beyond the scope of previously derived relations of this type [21] by explicitly retaining
all noises and cutoff terms. Importantly, for many one-body operators the multiplicative noise in the
energy-damped SPGPE is transformed into additive noise in the collective equations. This simplification opens the way for analytical treatments of a broad class of low-energy excitations in BEC
including solitons, vortices, and collective modes, for both number- and energy-damping decay channels. As a test we apply the Ehrenfest relations to the centre of mass fluctuations of a harmonically
trapped system tightly confined along two spatial dimensions. We find that the analtyic solution of
the SER for the centre of mass is in close agreement with SPGPE simulations. The SPGPE theory
of spinor and multicomponent systems [14] enables these techniques to be applied to systems where
dissipation can only proceed via energy damping.
The paper is structured as follows. The GPE, PGPE, and SPGPE are introduced in Sec. 2, and
the Ehrenfest relations for the GPE and PGPE briefly reviewed. In Sec. 3 we apply Ito’s formula
for change of variables to derive SERs for the SPGPE. We then derive a set of simple fluctuationdissipation relations describing equilibrium ensembles. In Sec. 4 we test the formalism on the centre
of mass motion of a harmonically trapped quasi-1D system. In Sec. 5 we discuss links between our
work and relevant linterature, and give our conclusions.

trajectories. Many-body expectation values are calculated as ensemble averages over trajectories of
the stochastic field theory [9]. When generalizing the above definitions [(6)—(10)] to the many-body
theory as described below, the average h·i refers only to the wavefunction expectation over position
coordinates. The combination of wavefunction and ensemble average will be denoted by hh·ii.

Stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation

The derivation of the complete SPGPE for scalar BEC appeared in [10]. A later generalization allows
for the possibility of multiple components and spins [14]. The derivation involves finding a master
equation for the coherent region density operator. A series of approximations valid at high temperartures [21] then gives the high temperature regime master equation, which is mapped to an equivalent
equation of motion for the multimode Wigner distribution function W[ψ, ψ∗ ] using quantum to classical operator correspondences [7, 24]. The result of this is a generalized Fokker-Planck equation
(FPE) of motion for the Wigner function that includes third-order functional derivates. An equation
of motion for a quasi-probability distribution can only be mapped to an SDE if it takes the form of
a Fokker-Planck equation, that is, only contains functional derivatives up to second order and has a
positive semi-definite diffusion matrix. Futher progress can be made by neglecting the third-order
derivatives, an approximation known as the truncated Wigner approximation. Such an approximation is physically well justified at high temperatures where thermal and classical noise dominate over
quantum noise [25]. To establish notation and formulate the problem, we now summarize the key
results.
2.2.1

Projector

The SPGPE requires a clear formulation of a projection operator that formally and numerically projects
the nonlinear GPE dynamics into a low-energy subspace. To define the projector, the external potential is split into a time-invariant part and a time-dependent part V(r, t) ≡ V(r) + δV(r, t). The time
independent part defines the single-particle Hamiltonian
Hsp ≡ −

~2 ∇2
+ V(r).
2m

(11)

The basis of representation is chosen to be the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian, satisfying Hsp φn (r) =
n φn (r), where n denotes the set of quantum numbers required to completely describe the singleparticle basis states, with corresponding energy eigenvalues n .
The projector can be written in operator form as
X
P̂ =
|nihn|,
(12)
n∈C

where the coherent region C is defined as the set of basis states beneath the cutoff: C ≡ {n : n ≤ c }.
In position space, this becomes an integral operator projecting an arbitrary function F(r) into C, with
action on the function F(r) written as

where the incoherent region I is defined as I ≡ {n : n > c }. Since P̂ is Hermitian, for any two states

Provided δV ≡ 0, N and H are both formally conserved by the PGPE: ∂t N = {N, H} = 0, ∂t H =
{H, H} = 0. A short account of the former is instructive. Evaluating the projected derivatives, we have
Z

{N, H} =
d3 r ψ∗ (r)(PLψ)(r) − ψ(r)(PLψ)∗ (r).
(22)
i~
Since P is hermitian, and Pψ ≡ ψ for projected fields, we then have {N, H} ≡ 0. As usual, additional
conserved quantities may exist when the confining potential possesses additional symmetries, and
numerical conservation requires that the basis also respect the symmetry. In practice this requires that
the basis modes are eigenstates of the the symmetry generator.
2.2.2

Equations of motion

The PGPE gives Hamiltonian evolution of the coherent region field in isolation. In SPGPE c-field
theory, the incoherent region is usually assumed to be thermalised and is thus treated as a reservoir that
acts as a damping mechanism for the coherent region. Applying the truncated Wigner approximation
to the Born-Markov master equation for the Bose field leads to the Fokker-Planck equation [10]

while for distinct reservoir species, it is reduced by 1/2 [14]. The scattering potential Eq. (25) describes the reservoir interaction involving transfer of energy and momentum without transfer of particles.
Direct solution of the Fokker-Planck equation of motion (23) is impractical numerically. Working
with this FPE involving only derivatives up to second order, the Wigner function evolution equation
can be mapped to an equivalent SDE for ψ(r) [26], provided the diffusion matrix is positive semidefinite. For the FPE Eq. (23) this condition is always satisfied, and the stochastic projected GrossPitaevskii equation (SPGPE) is [10, 11, 14]

The notation (S) indicates that the SDE is to be interpreted as a stochastic integral in Stratonovich
form [26], and thus at a given time t the noises are not independent of the fields.
2.2.3

Energy cutoff and the single-particle basis

Before presenting our results, we remark that there exists a variety of interpretations in the literature of
a central feature of C-field theory: what constitutes a cutoff, and how should it be imposed in practice?
In some cases any convenient numerical basis of representation is truncated. However, truncation in
an arbitrary basis will not usually generate a consistent energy cutoff, and some care should be taken
when choosing a basis of representation. In particular, if a highly inappropriate basis of representation
is used, then thermal noise driving the C-field modes will generate thermalization artifacts [21]. In
our approach to the SPGPE we impose the cutoff in the single-particle basis generated by the timeindependent confining potential. There is a clear physical motivation for this choice (clearly articulated
by the pioneers of the PGPE): at sufficiently high energy — usually of order 2-3µ — the interacting
many-body problem is approximately diagonal in the single-particle basis. Thus a well-chosen cutoff
in the single-particle basis is also an approximate energy cutoff for the many-body system, precisely
what is required for its separation into coherent and incoherent subspaces. These considerations will
feature below in our discussion of equilibrium properties of the SPGPE.

Stochastic Ehrenfest relations

Ehrenfest relations for the stochastic field can be derived by casting the SPGPE in Ito form. The noises
and fields are then uncorrelated, allowing change of variables using the rules of Ito calculus.

3.1

Ito form of the SPGPE

Recasting the SPGPE in Ito form involves reordering the projected function derivatives in the final
term of the FPE and mapping the equation to a new SDE.

and trace2 term. It is worth remarking that that the general expression obtained above allows for any
observable. Furthermore, it is well-suited for significant simplification via an ansatz for the wavefunction, provided the integrals may be evaluated. In the remainder of this paper we explore the
consequences of this formulation, providing explicit stochastic equations for particular observables of
interest.

One-body operators

If we restrict our attention to one-body operators, the projected functional calculus assumes a particularly simple form. Consider a quantity that is the pure-state trace of a one-body operator

A[ψ, ψ ] = hψ|Â|ψi =
d3 rhψ|Â|riψ(r),
(40)
where the operator Â is independent of ψ, ψ∗ . We emphasize that this quantity is spatial average for
the pure state wavefunction associated with each trajectory, and does not represent the many-body
expectation value found by tracing over the density matrix (the ensemble average). The non-zero
projected functional derivatives are

The projected functional derivatives corresponding to the operator Â are equivalent to the regular
functional derivatives of the totally projected operator ÂP ≡ P̂ÂP̂; the change of variables is then
simple to construct. Again writing in the form of a wave function average with additional projector

where the noise correlators are given by Eqs. (46),(47). This set of equations are our main result. They
take the form of generalized Ehrenfest relations with additional damping and noise terms arising from
the reservoir coupling processes. They provide a starting point for finding analytic descriptions of hot
BEC dynamics, and also provide tests for numerical consistency of SPGPE simulations. We make the
following remarks:
i) Ensemble averages.—Neglecting energy-damping and taking the average over the noise (in Ito
form the fields and noises are uncorrelated), we immediately recover the Ehrenfest relations for
the number-damped SPGPE as found in [21]. Those Ehrenfest relations described the evolution
of ensemble avarages, whereas in the present formulation we retain all noises in the collective
equations.

ii) Multiplicative noise.—Superficially, the multiplicative noise in the SPGPE Eq. (28) may appear
to have been transformed into additive
p noise. However, we emphasize that multiplicative noises
remain present in terms of the form hÂidW j , since hÂi is not a noise average.
iii) Additive noise.—Reduction to additive noise can be achieved in special cases where the system
can be well-described by a suitable physically motivated ansatz wavefunction. If such an ansatz is
available, reduction to an additive noise SDE provides a significant simplification that can enable
analytical progress [19].
iv) Projector terms.—The projector terms are all consistently accounted for, and in general contribute
additional noises. However, provided the basis of projection is properly chosen, their effect is
typically only a small correction. Testing whether such terms are negligible provides a useful
consistency test for a well-chosen cutoff.
v) Thermal equilibrium.—Formally it is known that trajectories of the SPGPE will approach a grand
canonical ensemble [10] describing the thermal equilibrium properties of the system. The c-field
ensemble is then drawn from the equilibrium Wigner functional
W[ψ, ψ∗ ] ∝ exp (−β(H − µN)).

(51)

In the SPGPE, the particular ensemble depends upon the ratio M/γ, with canonical equilibrium
reached in the limit M  γ, and grand-canonical equilibrium reached in the opposite limit. The
equilibrium ensemble satisfies a set of fluctuation-dissipation relations, as may be derived by
applying the steady-state condition to Eq. (50). In each case there is a balance between thermal
noise and the damping. For example, for pure number damping it is easily shown that hhL − µii =
kB T N for N ≡ Tr P̂ modes in the C-region. The correct balance between damping and noise is
manifest through the absence of the dissipation parameters from such expressions, consistent with
their absence from the equilibrium ensemble Eq. (51). We note that ensemble (in)equivalence [27]
and the choice of an optimal cutoff [28] are both active areas of research.

Application to centre of mass fluctuations

As a test of the formalism we consider centre of mass oscillations in a quasi-1D harmonically trapped
system with frequency for transverse trapping ω⊥ such that ω⊥  ω, the frequency for the axial
trap. Our primary aim is to test the validity of our analytical approach against c-field simulations.
The system we choose is particularly simple and thus amenable to analytic treatment of the SERs.
However, we must take some care in interpreting the reservoir theory in this case, as the Bose gas in a
harmonic trap obeys Kohn’s theorem.
Kohn’s theorem states that in a harmonically trapped system the centre of mass undergoes bulk
oscillations about the trap centre at the trapping frequency. While the second-quantized field theory
satisfies Kohn’s theorem, the best available c-field reservoir theory describes the I region as time independent, and hence violates Kohn’s theorem. C-field theory is thus currently best suited to systems
for which a time-independent high-energy thermal reservoir is a reasonable approximation. We emphasize that the low-energy c-field is a dynamical treatment of both condensate and non-condensate;
above a high-energy cutoff the dynamics are typically not included due to technical limitations.
While the time-independent reservoir approximation (TIRA) is not strictly applicable for scalar
BEC in the purely harmonic trap, there are a number of physical systems where it is applicable:
13

SciPost Physics

Submission

Kohn’s theorem does not apply to a scalar Bose gas held in a harmonic trap if the trap becomes non
harmonic at high energy. The theorem is also inapplicable for a harmonically trapped system if the
reservoir consists of second atomic species confined by a different trapping potential, as may occur
during sympathetic cooling. Furthermore, any system that is not harmonically trapped will not obey
Kohn’s theorem, and is thus potentially amenable to the TIRA. Examples systems in non-harmonic
traps for which the theory is applicable include vortex decay in hard-wall confinement [46], soliton
decay in a 1D toroidal trap (where the present approach was first used) [19], and persistent current
formation in a 3D toroidal trap, where SPGPE simulations [17] compare well with experiment [44].
In this work our approach is simply to test the formalism on a simple model system within the
TIRA by integrating out the spatial degrees of freedom to find effective stochastic equations of motion
for the centre of mass. We stress that the TIRA approached used here is physically valid for (at least)
two scenarios if immediate interest: non-harmonic trapping at high energies for a scalar BEC, and
sympathetic cooling involving two BEC components in different harmonic traps [14]3 . An effective
one-dimensional theory can be found in the prolate trapping regime where the reservoir remains three
dimensional4 , and the low-dimensional subspace is well-described by projecting onto the transverse
ground state of the confining potential.
The one dimensional SPGPE assumes an identical functional form to the three dimensional SPGPE,
but with dimensionally reduced damping and noise coefficients [18]. The number-damping term is
only changed by the replacement 1 → 11D , as are the Hamiltonian terms. The scattering kernel in the
1D reduction of Eq. (26) becomes

to be sufficiently condensed that the centre of mass motion can be approximated using a ThomasFermi wavefunction ansatz. We do not require that this is a good approximation — indeed, the hightemperature regime requires that it must not be. We merely require that it should approximate the
centre of mass motion. The Thomas-Fermi wave function allowing for arbitrary variations in the
centre of mass position x(t) and momentum p(t) is

The theory introduced here can be developed into a first-principles treatment for a particular atom number and temperature by self-consistent calculation of the reservoir interaction parameters [3, 13, 17].

Without this restriction the complexity of the reservoir interactions increases significantly and we do not pursue this
regime further here.

given in Appendix B.1, severely constrain exact analytic progress beyond this point. Provided these
terms may be safely neglected, we can arrive at an approximate set of equations that can be solved
analytically. For consistent c-field simulations, neglecting the projector terms in the SERs will always
be a good approximation, since for a well-chosen cutoff the mode population near the cutoff will be
relatively small. Since we are considering equilibrium states, we can assume that the values of x(t) and
p(t) will also be small relative to the characteristic harmonic oscillator length and momentum scales;
we test our assumptions by solving the SPGPE numerically. It is convenient to rewrite the equations

Analytic and numerical solutions

In this section we present an analytical treatment of the stochastic equations discussed in Section 4.1,
and compare the results with numerical simulations of the 1D SPGPE. The analytic approach offers a
simple intuitive picture of the dynamics of the centre of mass, for both number and energy damping
mechanisms, and for both dissipation and noise.
Neglecting the projector terms, we can write the coupled differential equation as a vector SDE

The defining property of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is that the drift and diffusion matrices are independent of the
stochastic field. Since the noise is additive, the distinction between Ito and Stratonovich is irrelevant for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
processes.

We now test our analytical description against SPGPE simulations. While the SPGPE can be
used for quantitative modelling [17, 29, 30] here our aim is simply to test our analytic solutions of the
SPGPE using the SERs. We thus choose parameters that are representative of BEC experiments, and
leave a first principles treatment of reservoir interactions [18] for future work.
We perform simulations of the 1D SPGPE [18] with the initial condition given by Eq. (53) with
x(0) = p(0) = 0. We use a chemical potential of µ = 100~ω, an energy cutoff of c = 250~ω, a
temperature of T = 500~ω/kB , an interaction strength of 11D = 0.01~ωaω , an energy-damping rate of
M = 0.0005a2ω , and a number-damping rate of γ = 0.001. We chose values for the damping rates such
that Λε ≈ Λγ and thus neither damping process is dominant over the other. Timescales are considered
in units of the harmonic oscillator time period tω ≡ 2π/ω.
We compare our analytic solutions with the numerical data from equilibrated SPGPE simulations.
In Fig. 2 we show the steady-state correlation functions for an ensemble of 5000 trajectories7 . We
see that the analytic and numeric results show excellent agreement for short times with differences
becoming more pronounced for larger τ. Similarly, the steady-state spectra for position-position,
momentum-momentum, and momentum-position are shown in Fig. 3, where the numeric spectra are
obtained using the Wiener-Khinchin theorem applied to the numeric steady-state correlations. The
bulk oscillation seen in Fig. 2 is the Kohn mode, as seen from the peak at Ω ≡ ω in Fig. 3. The
spectral linewidth represents the decay time of the two-time correlation function, determined by Λε
and Λγ , the energy and number damping rates. Again we see that the analytic and numeric results show
good agreement. To assess the validity of neglecting projector terms in our analytical treatment, we
evaluate their contribution numerically in Appendix B.3, finding that indeed the projector correction
is negligible.

7

When calculating the correlations from the numeric data, we have assumed that the system has reached equilibrium
after five trap cycles t = 5tω , and used ergodic averaging over the remaining time interval t = 5tω . With respect to the
dissipation timescale (Λγ + Λε )−1 , the timescale of averaging is equivalent to t = 2.78(Λγ + Λε )

Discussion and Conclusions
Discussion

The SERs derived here using projected functional calculus contain many projector terms, posing a
technical challenge. As an application of projected functional calculus, our approach bears comparison
with that of Opanchuk et al [31], where a number of useful functional relations were derived for
Wigner phase-space methods [6] involving projected fields. The action of the projector was reduced
to the action of matrix operations, as is always possible in a finite basis. While not without its own
technical challenges, our approach has the advantage that the equations of motion have an obvious
link with the continuum limit recovered for a high cutoff.
An alternate stochastic reservoir theory, namely the Stoof SGPE [32], has been used in several
studies of finite-temperature BEC dynamics [33–37]. While the SGPE lacks a projection operator of
the form used in the present work, our aims are similar in spirit to the work of Duine et al. [38] applying
path-integral techniques to the Stoof SGPE to find effective stochastic equations for a reduced set of
variables. However, the explicit high-energy cutoff in the SPGPE necessitates a different technical
approach, with significant differences appearing in the resulting stochastic equations. As the energydamping mechanism is absent from the Stoof SGPE, an interesting future direction is to identify
further experimentally accessible regimes capable of distinguishing between the two approaches [30].
A related question receiving recent attention is that of ensemble equivalence [27]; in general the
equilibrium ensemble generated by the SPGPE will be affected by the relative strengths of number
and energy damping processes.
In applications of the SPGPE, the energy cutoff must be chosen such that the bulk of the coherent
region modes are significantly occupied compared to the modes in the incoherent region. The relative
occupation at the cutoff thus determines the presence of spurious dynamics due to the projector, and
this population can typically be chosen to be of order unity. Ultimately, large projector corrections
generate spurious dynamics and for a consistent treatment the cutoff should be chosen such that the
projector corrections are small.

Conclusions

We have developed a set of exact stochastic Ehrenfest relations (SERs) for the complete stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation [10], an equation of motion which has significant application in the
study of finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates [3, 9, 11]. In addition to the number-damping
process, the SPGPE contains a number-conserving dissipative mechanism that transfers energy between the system and reservoir. Our main result, the SERs, retain the stochastic nature of the SPGPE
and explicitly contain terms that result from both number- and energy-damping processes.
We tested our stochastic Ehrenfest equations in two ways. Considering the centre of mass motion of a finite-temperature quasi-1D condensate near equilibrium, we tracked the size of the largest
projector corrections and saw they are indeed small. We also compared the steady-state correlations
of position and momentum to analytic solutions derived by neglecting the projector corrections, finding excellent agreement. Our chosen test system has the weakness that the centre of mass motion in
a purely harmonic trap is not strictly amenable to the reservoir theory due to a violation of Kohn’s
theorem, However, our treatment is physically relevant for non-harmonic trapping, multicomponent
systems, and other systems of interest that physically violate Kohn’s theorem, provided a low-energy
fraction is harmonically trapped. Indeed, since the thermal equilibrium properties involve small excursions from equilibrium, the confining potential is only required to be locally harmonic near the trap
minimum and any number of non-harmonic effects may intrude at larger distances. The centre of mass
motion thus provides an excellent formal and numerical test of the SERs, being one of the simplest
states of motion to handle analytically.
We have shown that SERs can be used to obtain analytic equations that agree with numerical
solutions of the full SPGPE and offer some physical insight into the open system dynamics. Future
work will explore systems involving analytically tractable excitations such as vortex decay in hardwall confinement [46], soliton [39] and phase-slip dynamics [40] in toroidal confinement, sympathetic
cooling [41, 42], spinor BECs [43], and quantum turbulence in non-harmonic traps [44–47].

of imposing a very high energy cutoff, the populations of the modes above the cutoff approach zero
and hence all the cutoff terms go to zero. For a well-chosen but finite cutoff the integrals involving
the overlap of the lowest energy incoherent mode φnc +1 (x) and the coherent field wave function ψ(x)
should be small, as φnc +1 (x) is highly oscillatory and the mode population is also small by definition.
We claim that for a well-chosen cutoff the cutoff terms are small enough such that they may be neglected, and we justify this in two ways. Firstly, we consider the magnitude of a selection of the cutoff
terms by calculating them numerically. Second, we consider the analytic solutions that can be found
by neglecting the cutoff terms and show that these agree well with simulations of the 1D SPGPE.
When considering the cutoff terms involving mode mixing at the cutoff (i.e. all except the epsilon
correction), we note that only the Hamiltonian cutoff term qzH Eq. (82a) does not have one of the
damping rates as a multiplying factor. As the damping rates have a typical value several orders of
magnitude less than unity, it is reasonable to expect that of all these terms, the Hamiltonian cutoff
term will be the largest. If we show that qzH is small enough to be neglected then we can reason that
γ
γ
qz Eq. (82b), qεz Eq. (82c), dz Eq. (82d), dzε |(1) Eq. (82e), and dzε |(2) Eq. (82f) are smaller still and so
can certainly be neglected also.
The epsilon term dzε Eq. (82g) is distinct from the other terms, as it is not a result of mode mixing
at the cutoff. We expect the two terms in the epsilon term to almost cancel, as it is clear this is the case
in the limit that the projector becomes the identity. This is an important result of the earlier step where
we found that writing the SPGPE in Ito form resulted in an extra term; without this extra term the
epsilon term would in general be non-negligible, and in fact diverges in the infinite cutoff limit. We
thus monitor the magnitudes of qzH and dzε over the course of an ensemble of numerical trajectories.
We define the relative cutoff term magnitudes by
Ez(1) (t) = qzH (t)/ż(t) ,

Ez(2) (t) = |dzε (t)/ż(t)| ,

(83)

noting that |ż(t)| is strictly non-zero for harmonic motion. If these values remain significantly less than
unity, then we may conclude that the effects of the cutoff terms are negligible. For the simulations
of section 4.2, example relative cutoff term magnitudes are shown in Fig. 4, where the initial state is
Eq. (53) with x(0) = p(0) = 0 and we have taken an ensemble average over 1000 trajectories. While
the relative magnitudes can reach as high as ∼ 0.1 early in the dynamics, we see that once the system
