Abstract
We study solutions of the Volterra lattice satisfying the stationary equation for
its non-autonomous symmetry. It is shown that the dynamics in t and n are governed
by the continuous and discrete Painlevé equations, respectively. The class of initial
data leading to regular solutions is described. For the lattice on the half-line, these
solutions are expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function. The
Hankel transform of the coefficients of the corresponding Taylor series is computed
on the basis of the Wronskian representation of the solution.
Keywords: Volterra lattice, symmetry, Painlevé equation, confluent hypergeometric function, Hankel transformation, Catalan numbers.

Introduction

Let an evolution equation ut = f [u] admits a symmetry uτ = g[t, u] (that is, vector
fields ∂t and ∂τ commute), then the stationary equation g[t, u] = 0 defines a constraint
which is consistent with the dynamics in t. Moreover, if ∂τ belongs to a commutative
Lie subalgebra of the higher symmetries, then the stationary equation inherits this
subalgebra. It is well known that many important classes of exact solutions satisfy such
stationary equations, including the finite-gap, multisoliton and rational solutions. On
the other hand, if ∂τ contains some members of the additional noncommutative Lie
subalgebra of symmetries then the constraint leads to a Painlevé type equation. Such
solutions are also considered in the literature for a long time, but, for the understandable
reasons, they are studied much worse.
In this paper we study the solutions of the Volterra lattice un,t = un (un+1 − un−1 )
which satisfy the stationary equation for the master-symmetry (plus lower order terms).
An analogous, more simple constraint was studied in papers [1, 2], where the evolution
in n was governed by the discrete Painlevé equation dP1 and the evolution in t was
governed by the Painlevé equation P4 . In our case, the respective equations are dP34
and P5 (or P3 , for degenerating parameters). The corresponding set of solutions is not
so small and contains a family of solutions depending on three essential parameters,
which are regular for all n, t.

Section 2 contains the definition of the constraint under study, lowering of its order
and reduction to the Painlevé equations. In Section 3, we define a subclass of regular
solutions. It is characterized by the special choice of initial data at the fixed singular
point t = 0 and by certain restrictions on the values of parameters, ensuring the absence
of poles at t 6= 0. These solutions describe small-scale oscillations in a region that
grows linearly with increase of t. Such behavior is typical for generic solutions outside
the soliton sector with the initial data in the form of sharp spikes. The constraint
which we study is of interest as an example of exact solution (in terms of the Painlevé
transcendents) for this mode. However, so far these solutions are investigated only
numerically.
Section 4 deals with the case when, in addition to the constraint equations, the condition u0 = 0 is satisfied. Then the lattice equations admit a reduction on the half-line
n > 0, and the equations P5 and P3 are reduced, respectively, to the confluent hypergeometric equation and the Bessel equation. Section 5 contains asymptotic formulas for
the regular solutions related to the hypergeometric equation.
The class of solutions in study contains, in particular, the solution with the most
simple initial data in the form of the unit step u0 = 0, un (0) = 1 for n > 0. It was
constructed in our previous paper [3] by comparing of the Wronskian representation
for the Volterra lattice solution [4] with the well known result from the combinatorics
about the Hankel transform for the Catalan numbers [5, 6, 7]. Now we are able to
reverse this construction and to apply the constraint equations for computing of the
Hankel transform. In Section 6, this is done for the coefficients of the Taylor expansion
of the Kummer function.

Constraints for the Volterra lattice

The Volterra lattice
un,t = un (un+1 − un−1 )

(1)

possesses the symmetries
un,t2 = un (hn+1 − hn−1 ),

hn := un (un+1 + un + un−1 ),

un,τ0 = tun (un+1 − un−1 ) + un ,
un,τ1 = tun (hn+1 − hn−1 ) + un n +

un−1 .

The flow ∂τ0 corresponds to the scaling transformation and ∂τ1 is the master-symmetry
which generates the commutative Lie subalgebra of the symmetries by the formula
∂tk+1 = [∂τ1 , ∂tk ], starting from ∂t1 = ∂t [8, 9]. Both sequences ∂tk and ∂τk are infinite (and the flows ∂τk are non-local for k > 1), but in this paper we will need only the
above members of the whole hierarchy of the symmetries.
The stationary equation for any linear combination of the symmetries is a constraint
compatible with (1). The equations which correspond to the commutative symmetries
only, bring to the algebro-geometric (in particular, multisoliton) solutions. The simplest
example involving a noncommutative symmetry is given by equation
un,t2 + 2un,τ0 = 0
2

(the coefficient at the second term is fixed by scaling and the term un,t can be neglected,
due to the shift t → t − const). After dividing by un , the 5-point difference equation
appears
hn+1 − hn−1 + 2t(un+1 − un−1 ) + 2 = 0.
It can be easily reduced to the 3-point constraint
un (un+1 + un + un−1 ) + 2tun + n + (−1)n b + c = 0,

(2)

moreover, a straightforward computation proves that it is consistent with (1) if and only
if the integration constants b and c do not depend on t. This equation, known as the
discrete Painlevé equation dP1 , turns the lattice equations (1) into a coupled system for
the variables un−1 , un which is equivalent to the continuous Painlevé equation P4 for
the function y = un [1, 2, 10, 11]:

The mapping (un−1 , un ) 7→ (un , un+1 ) defines one of the Bäcklund transformations for
(3).
In this paper, our main goal will be to investigate another, more complicated case
un,τ1 − 4aun,τ0 − dun,t = 0.
Here, the coefficient a can be scaled either to 0 or to 1, and the shift of t makes possible
to remove the term un,t2 . Like in the previous example, this 5-point constraint can be
reduced to a 3-point one, although it is less obvious in this case. First, we notice that
the equation takes the following form, after dividing by un :
e n+1 + G
en = 0
G

⇒

e n + 4(−1)n b = 0,
Gn = G

where we denote
Gn = (qn+2 + qn+1 )un+1 − (qn + qn−1 )un − 4a(qn+1 − qn ) + 4(−1)n b = 0

(4)

qn = 2tun + n − d.

(5)

and
Next, we lower the order by use of the integrating factor:
(qn+1 + qn )Gn = Fen+1 − Fen = 0

⇒

Fn = Fen − 4c = 0,

where Fn is the left hand side of equation (6) below.
Statement 1. The lattice (1) is consistent with the equation
Fn = (qn+1 + qn )(qn + qn−1 )un − 4(aqn2 + (−1)n bqn + c) = 0,

(6)

where qn = 2tun +n−d, for any constants a, b, c, d and under assumption that qn+1 +qn 6=
0 at some inital moment t = t∗ , for all n.
3

Proof. A straightforward computation proves the identities
Gn,t = un+1 (Gn+1 + Gn ) − un (Gn + Gn−1 ),
Fn,t = un (qn + qn−1 )Gn + un (qn+1 + qn )Gn−1 ,
assuming, like for the constraint (2), that the integration constants b and c do not depend
on t. Let equation Fn = 0 is satisfied for t = t∗ , then also Gn = (Fn+1 −Fn )/(qn+1 +qn ) =
0 for t = t∗ . Then it follows from the above identities that Gn = Fn = 0 for all t such
that the solution un (t) exists.
Remark 1. The stipulation that qn+1 +qn do not vanish at t = t∗ is not very essential. We
need it only in order to provide Gn (t∗ ) = 0. However, in the situation when qn+1 +qn = 0
for some n, we can directly require that the initial conditions satisfy the equality Gn = 0,
then the constraint (6) will be preserved as before. In other words, if we consider
equation (6) as a mapping (un , un+1 ) 7→ (un+1 , un+2 ) then the equality qn+1 + qn = 0
determines a singularity which is eliminated by use of the equation Gn = 0.
Similar to the case (2), the constraint (6) turns the lattice equations (1) into a
coupled system for the variables un−1 , un , and the shift n 7→ n + 1 defines a Bäcklund
transformation for the latter. This system is equivalent, after some additional changes,
to the Painlevé equations P5 or P3 , depending on the value of the parameter a. The
following statement is verified by straightforward substitution, for which it is convenient
to completely rewrite equations (1) and (6) it terms of qn :

Notice, that (8) coincides, up to a scaling of parameters, with dP34 equation [11].

Regular solutions

In general, solutions of equations (1), (6) may have singularities in t. Such solutions are
of interest as well, but in this paper we restrict ourselves by consideration of a special
family of solutions, such that functions un (t) are continuously differentiable on the whole
axis t ∈ R, for all n ∈ Z. This regularuty condition strictly fixes the initial data of the
lattice at t = 0, that is, at the singular point of the system (1), (6). Indeed, since the
values un (0) are finite for a regular solution, hence qn+1 (0) + qn (0) = 2n − 2d + 1 and
we obtain from (6) that, if d is not a half-integer then
un (0) = a +

4(−1)n b(n − d) + 4c + a

4(n − d)2 − 1

d 6∈

(11)

Therefore, for the fixed values of a, b, c and d, we are talking about one special solution
of equations (1) and (6) (while the general solution is 2-parametric). In terms of the
P5 equation (9), this solution corresponds to the functions yn (t) without singularity at
t = 0, with the initial data
yn (0) = 1,

In the case when d = 12 + k is half-integer, the integrating factor qn+1 + qn which we
used for derivation of (6) turns into 0 for t = 0 and n = k, and we have to use equation
(4) instead of (6), as it was explained in Remark 1. For t = 0, it takes the form
(n − k + 1)un+1 (0) − (n − k − 1)un (0) = 2a − 2(−1)n b.
From here, all un (0) are uniqueley defined, except for uk (0) and uk+1 (0) which are
chosen independently on the rest values in such a way that their sum is constant:
(−1)n (2n − 2k − 1) + (−1)k
, n 6= k, k + 1,
2(n − k)(n − k − 1)
1
uk+1 (0) + uk (0) = 2a − 2(−1)k b, d = + k, k ∈ Z.
2

un (0) = a + b

(12)

These inital data can be viewed as a limiting case of (11) with c = (−1)k b/2 − a/4, for
d → 21 + k.
Under certain relations between parameters, it is possible that the equality um (0) = 0
is fulfilled which splits the lattice (1) into two independent systems for n < m and n > m.
We consider this case in the rest sections in more details, and now we will assume that
un (0) 6= 0 for all integer n.
The absence of singularity at t = 0 does not guarantee that the solution is regular
for all t, this requires an additional study. The numeric experiments show that, for the
solution family under scrutiny, the crucial property is related with the signs of un (0):
is all un (0) are of one and the same sign (positive, without loss of generality) then the
solution is regular for all n, t; in contrast, if there are un (0) with different signs then the
solution acquires a singularity at a finte t.

Remark 2. The question about the regularity criterium fot the solutions of lattice equations (1) with generic inital data is open. Regular solutions with different signs do exist:
a simple explicit example is the solution
u2n = −

β(n + δ)e2βt
,
α + e2βt

u2n+1 =

β(αn + γ)
,
α + e2βt

(13)

which, apparently, does not have singularities for α ≥ 0, and also the stationary solution
u2n = α, u2n+1 = β with constants of different signs. However, the nonalternating
solutions are of primary interest. In many papers, this requirement is simply postulated;
√
sometimes, the Volterra lattice is wrtten down in the variables pn = un .
For a = 0 and nonzero b, c, the initial data (11), (12) always change the sign and
there are no regular solutions. If a 6= 0 then one can set a = 1 without loss of generality.
In addition, taking into account the shift of n, one can assume that d ∈ (− 21 , 12 ]. Then
the condition of the positivity of the initial data reduces to inequalities
bd − c − d2 > 0,

b(d − 1) + c + (d − 1)2 > 0,

b(d + 1) + c + (d + 1)2 > 0

which cut off a bounded region in the parameter space (for a fixed d it is a triangle in
the b, c plane) and the corresponding solutions are regular. Fig. 1 demonstrates a typical
solution from this family, corresponding to the values a = 1, b = 0, c = −3/4 and d = 0.
The initial profile is shown on the left plot. It quickly collapses and generates a zone
of small-scale oscillations (with the period comparable to the lattice spacing), which
has an arrow-shaped profile and expands at a constant speed in both directions with
increasing t (for the negative t, the direction of the arrowhead changes). For nonzero
b and d, the initial data look a bit more complicated, but the general behavior of the
solution remains the same. Moreover, the picture does not change much if we take the
initial data that do not satisfy the constraint (6), but are close to (11). Apparently,
this behavior is typical for solutions with generic initial data in the form of sharp spikes
(as opposed to solutions of the soliton type, which are formed when the initial data are
relatively gently sloping). Fig. 2 shows a solution for initial data which differ from 1
at two points. Each spike generates oscillations of the type described, which form an
interference pattern after fusion.
Thus, this is a fairly common mode in the Volterra lattice that deserves to be studied.
It would be interesting to obtain its description from the point of view of the inverse

scattering method. The constraint (6), with positive initial data, is of interest as an
exact solution example for this mode, in terms of the Painlevé transcendents. More
precisely, here we use not all solutions of P5 , but only one, which is distinguished by the
regularity condition at t = 0. However, this solution does not seem to be expressed in
terms of classical special functions, at least for the general values of parameters.

Solutions on the half-line

Assume that, in addition to the constraint (6), the condition u0 = 0 is fulfilled (which
is also a constraint, consistent with the lattice equations (1)). In this case, the lattice
splits into two unrelated subsystems for n < 0 and n > 0. It is enough to consider
solutions on the half-line n > 0. First of all, we notice that if u0 = 0 then the system of
ordinary differential equation for the variables u0 , u1 (which is equivalent, in general, to
a Painlevé equation) reduces to the Riccati equation for u1 .
Statement 3. Let un be a solution of the lattice (1) governed by the constraints (6) and
u0 = 0. Then the function u1 (t) satisfies the equation

Proof. Substituting of u0 = 0 into equations (6) for n = 0 and n = 1 gives

1
(q2 + q1 )(q1 − d)u1 − aq12 + bq1 − c = 0,
4
where qn = 2tun + n − d. Subtracting one equation from another and dividing by q1 − d,
we obtain
1
(q2 + q1 )u1 − a(q1 + d) + b = 0.
4
This is equivalent to (14), taking into account the relation u01 = u1 u2 which follows from
equation (1). The passage to equation (15) is standard.
Thus, u0 = 0 and u1 is constructed by solving equation (15), then all functions un+1
for n = 1, 2, . . . are constructed by recurrent relations, either by use of the lattice itself:
un+1 =

u0n

(this is the constraint equation (6) with c = bd − ad2 resolved with respect to un+1 ).
As in the previous section, we will consider only regular solutions, and such that
un 6= 0 for n > 0 (since otherwise the solution is constrained to a finite interval). In this
case, equations (11), (12) are slightly refined and we arrive to the following statement.
As before, it guarantees only regularity at t = 0; the regularity for all t is related with
the constant sign property of the sequence (18).
Statement 4. Let u0 = 0 and let un 6= 0 be a solution of the lattice (1) for n > 0,
satisfying the constraint (6) and regular at t = 0. Then

denominators do not vanish. If d 6= 12 then the expression for u1 (0) is also found from

correspond to one or two terms of the asymptotic expansions.

(11) and if d = 12 then it is obtained from (12) for k = 0 (or directly from equation (14)).
Solving the inequalities u2k−1 (0) 6= 0 for the obtained initial data brings to restrictions
b 6= a(2k − 1); the inequalities u2k (0) 6= 0 yield b 6= 2a(d − k).
For d = 21 + k, k > 0, we use equations (12) instead of (11). In this case, if follows
from the equality u0 = 0 that
a=b

The corresponding initial data (18) are alternating. Numeric experiments show that if
b < 0 (without loss of generality) then the solution acquires the poles at t < 0, but it
tends to 0 for t > 0 (the corresponding function y is the Bessel function of the imaginary
argument). This gives an example of alternating solution which is bounded and regular
in the quadrant n, t > 0. However, this solution is very unstable with respect to the
calculation errors and the perturbations of the initial data.

Asymptotics in the case a = 1, u0 = 0

If a 6= 0 then the scaling of the independent variable z = 4at, f (t) = y(z) brings (15) to

the Kummer function M (α, β, z) (or 1 F1 (α; β; z) in other notation), that is, f (t) =
M (α, β, 4at).
In this section we set a = 1 without loss of generality. If b = 0 and d = − 12 then
the initial data take especially simple form of the unit step: un (0) = 1 for n > 0.

Figure 4. Solution with random perturbation of the initial unit step.

The corresponding solution, shown of fig. 3, was studied in [3] (notice, that we used
there an equivalent representation of f in terms of the modified Bessel function: f (t) =
e2t (I0 (2t) − I00 (2t)) = M ( 21 , 2, 4t); however, f is not expressed through In for the generic
initial data (18)).
The initial data are changed for other admissible values of b and d, but the general
behaviour of the solution remains the same, exactly as for the case of solutions described
in Section 3. Moreover, the numeric experiments demonstrate that this mode is stable
with respect to small enough perturbations of the step-like initial data (of course, under
the condition that the boundary value u0 = 0 is not changed). Fig. 4 shows the evolution
of the initial data
un (0) = 1 + 0.9 exp(−0.001(n − 30)2 )rn ,

n > 0,

where rn is a random value uniformly distributed in [−1, 1]. This perturbation leads
to appearance of soliton-like structures on the pure decay solution background, but the
overall asymptotics does not change.
To determine the asymptotics, we use the formal expansion of the solution of the
Riccati equation (14)
u1 = q0 + q1 t−1 + q2 t−2 + . . .
Substitution into equation proves that the leading term may take the values q0 = 4 or
q0 = 0, while the subsequent coefficients are computed uniquely. This gives two series
which correspond to the different asymptotics at t → ±∞, which is easy to see by

From here it follows, for the function u1 = f 0 /f and for real z = 4t, that u1 ∼ 4 − (α −
β)t−1 + . . . at t → +∞ and u1 ∼ 0 + αt−1 + . . . at t → −∞. Next, the expansions for
all un are obtained by intermediate use of equation (14) and the lattice equation (1).
We wil restrict ourselves by two first terms of the asymptotics.
Statement 5. Consider the solution of the lattice (1) with u0 = 0 and the initial data

It is easy to prove by induction that expansions for un at t → +∞ are of the following
form, depending on the parity of n:
u2j =

pj,2 pj,3
+ 3 + ...,
t2
t

u2j+1 = 4 +

qj,1 qj,2

and that the substitution into (1) gives the difference equations for the coefficients
qj,1 − qj−1,1 = −2,
pj,2 (qj,2 − qj−1,2 ) = −pj,3 ,

4pj+1,2 − 4pj,2 = −qj,1 ,
2
16pj+1,3 − 16pj,3 + 8qj,2 = qj,1
.

Similarly, the expansions at t → −∞ start from t−1 for all n:
u2j = pj,1 t−1 + pj,2 t−2 + . . . ,

u2j+1 = qj,1 t−1 + qj,2 t−2 + . . .
11

and the coefficients are governed by equations
qj,1 − qj−1,1 = −1,

pj+1,1 − pj,1 = −1,

pj,1 (qj,2 − qj−1,2 ) = −pj,2 ,

qj,1 (pj+1,2 − pj,2 ) = −qj,2 .

The initial data for these equations are given by the coefficients q0,1 , q0,2 of the above
series for u1 and the values p0,k = 0 corresponding to u0 = 0. In both cases, the solution
is easily obtained as polynomials in j and we obtain the required formulas by returning
to the variable n.
For t > 0, one can obtain a rough estimate of the decay zone by constructing a
triangular region bounded by the plots of one or two terms of the asymptotic expansions,
as shown on figs. 3 and 4. In particular, an upper bound for the wedge point n0 (t) of
the decay zone can be obtained by solving the inequality 4 − 2n0 −2d+b
> 1, which gives,
2t
apparently, n0 < 3t + const. More accurate estimates can be obtained by taking the
next asymptotic terms. For the negative t, the solution is well approximated by the first
term of the asymptotics.
We conclude this section with a note on the conservation laws of the Volterra lattice,
that is, relations of the form

In the case of the problem on the whole line and with the initial data which have
the same constant asymptotics for n → ±∞, it follows from (22) that the quantities
P (k)
Hk = n (ρn − r(k) ) are preserved, where the summation is taken over all integer n
and the constant r(k) is chosen so that the sum is well defined. For the lattice truncated
by u0 = 0, the analogous sums over n > 0 do not preserve, since

Determinant identities

In addition to the recurrent relations (16), (17), there exists the Wronskian representation of the Volterra lattice solution on the half-line, which goes back to the Leznov
paper [4]. It is not very convenient for a practical computing of solutions, but we will
show that using it together with explicit expressions for u1 (t) and un (0) makes possible
to get nontrivial identities for some number sequences.
Statement 6. The solution of the lattice (1) on the half-line n ≥ 0, such that u0 = 0
and u1 = f 0 /f , with an arbitrary infinitely differentiable function f (t), is of the form
un =

wn−3 wn
,
wn−2 wn−1

n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(23)

where w−3 = 0, w−2 = w−1 = 1 and, for k ≥ 0,

w2k =

Proof. We will prove that wn satisfy equations
0
wn wn+1
− wn0 wn+1 = wn−1 wn+2 ,

n = −2, −1, 0, 1, . . . ,

(25)

then it is easy to check that substitution (23) gives a (unique) solution of the lattice
equations (1) with u0 = 0 and u1 = f 0 /f .
For n = −2, −1, the relations (25) are verified directly. For n ≥ 0, let W (A) denote
the Wronskian of an arbitrary finite sequence A of smooth functions (possibly empty).
For n = 2k we set A = f (1) , . . . , f (k) , then
wn−1 = W (A),

wn = W (f (0) , A) = (−1)k W (A, f (0) ),

wn+1 = W (A, f (k+1) ),

wn+2 = W (f (0) , A, f (k+1) ) = (−1)k W (A, f (0) , f (k+1) ).

Similarly, for n = 2k + 1 we set A = f (0) , . . . , f (k) , then
wn−1 = W (A),

wn = W (1, A) = (−1)k+1 W (A, 1),

wn+1 = W (A, f (k+1) ),

wn+2 = W (1, A, f (k+1) ) = (−1)k+1 W (A, 1, f (k+1) ).

In both cases, equation (25) is satisfied due to the identity
W (A, b)

d
d
W (A, c) − W (A, b)W (A, c) = W (A)W (A, b, c),

where b, c are arbitrary smooth functions. In order to prove it, it is sufficient to consider
both left and right hand sides as the differential operators with respect to c and to
compare their kernels and the coefficients at the highest derivative.

The determinants of the form (24) for the number sequences f0 , f1 , f2 , . . . are actively
studied in combinatorics. Recall that the Hankel transformation for such a sequence is
the sequence of determinants of size n × n with (i, j)-th element equal to fi+j−2 . This
mapping is not one-to-one, since the determinant of size n involves 2n−1 members of the
sequence. To get a one-to-one mapping, one can use simultaneously Hankel transforms
for the sequence itself and the sequence without the zero member, provided that all
determinants do not vanish.
For instance, the Hankel transform of the Catalan numbers 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132,
429, . . . is the sequence 1, 1, 1, . . . and the same is true for the sequence of the Catalan
numbers with the first member dropped [5, 6, 7]. In [3], we associated these identities of
the Catalan numbers with the Wronskian representation of the solution with the initial
data u0 = 0, un (0) = 1, n > 0 and derived the Riccati equation for u1 (t) from this.
Now we are able to reverse and to generalize this result. Indeed, the Wronskians w2k
and w2k+1 define the Hankel transformations for the sequences f, f 0 , . . . and f 0 , f 00 , . . . ,
respectively. By setting t = 0 in (24), we obtain the Hankel transformations for the
coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the function f (t) (here, the regularity for other
values of t is not necessary) and it remains to compare the result with the known initial
data by substituting into equation (23) at t = 0.
Statement 7. Let a solution of the lattice equation (1) on the half-line n ≥ 0 be given
by equations (23), (24) with the function f given by the Taylor expansion
f (t) = f0 + f1 t + · · · + fn

Proof. By setting hn = wn (0), we obtain h−2 = h−1 = h0 = 1 and the recurrent relation
hn hn−3 = un (0)hn−1 hn−2 ,

n = 1, 2, . . . ,

which proves the statement by induction.
We note that some nontrivial identities follows from here even for the explicit solution
u2k−1 = et ,

u2k = k

which is a particular case of solution (13) at α = 0, β = −1/2, γ = −2 and δ = 0. In
this case we find, by solving equation f 0 /f = u1 = et , that

set of n elements. Here u2k−1 (0) = 1, u2k (0) = k and one obtains easily that h2k =
h2k+1 = 1! · · · k! (the superfactorial of k). This result is known since 1978 [13].
Now, let us apply Statement 7 to solutions desribed in the previous section (however,
now we do not set a = 1). Due to the known expansion of the Kummer function, we
have

where (α)n is the Pochhammer symbol
(α)n = α(α + 1) · · · (α + n − 1),

(α)0 = 1.

In addition, let us denote
((α))n = (α)1 · · · (α)n = αn (α + 1)n−1 · · · (α + n − 1)1 ,

((α))0 = 1;

in particular, the superfactorial is denoted as ((1))n = 1! · · · n!.

(β + 2k − 1)(β + 2k)

u2k (0) = 4a

k = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,

and the inequalities for α and β coincide exactly with the conditions (19) which guarantee
that all numerators and denominators are not 0. According to Statements 3 and 6, the
corresponding regular (at t = 0) solution of the Volterra lattice is defined by equations
(23), (24) with function (27) and we only have to substitute the initial data into (26)
and to arrange the factors.

to the choice a = 1, b = 0 and d = − 12 (or, α = 12 and β = 2). In this case the initial

recurrence relation hn hn−3 = un (0)hn−1 hn−2 directly, which immediately gives that all
hn = 1.

Similarly, the central binomial coefficients fn =

and the recurrent relation yields h2k = 2k , h2k+1 = 2k+1 . This example is also known
in the combinatorics.
In particular, the example with the Catalan numbers fn =
