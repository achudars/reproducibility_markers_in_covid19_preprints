Homomorphisms of matrix algebras and constructions
of Butson-Hadamard matrices
Padraig Ó Catháin and Eric Swartz
Abstract. An n × n matrix H is Butson-Hadamard if its entries are k th roots of unity and
it satisfies HH ∗ = nIn . Write BH(n, k) for the set of such matrices.
Suppose that k = pα q β where p and q are primes and α ≥ 1. A recent result of Östergård
and Paavola uses a matrix H ∈ BH(n, pk) to construct H ′ ∈ BH(pn, k). We simplify the
proof of this result and remove the restriction on the number of prime divisors of k. More
precisely, we prove that if k = mt, and each prime divisor of k divides t, then we can
construct a matrix H ′ ∈ BH(mn, t) from any H ∈ BH(n, k).

1. Introduction
A Butson-Hadamard matrix H ∈ BH(n, k) is a matrix whose entries are all complex k th
roots of unity satisfying HH ∗ = nIn , where H ∗ denotes the conjugate transpose of H and
In is the n × n identity matrix. It follows from the definition that distinct rows of a ButsonHadamard matrix are orthogonal. Hadamard proved that a matrix M with real entries of
modulus bounded by 1 has determinant at most nn/2 and that this bound is met if and only
if M is a real Hadamard matrix, i.e., if and only if M ∈ BH(n, 2) [6]. Butson-Hadamard
matrices are so-named for their appearance in [1], where Butson constructed matrices in
BH(2p, p).
A major open question in the theory of Butson-Hadamard matrices is for which pairs of
integers (n, k) the set BH(n, k) is nonempty. Recently a number of authors have used matrices
in BH(n, k) to construct matrices in BH(mn, t) for various values of (m, n, t). The first result
of this type is due to Cohn, who proved that the existence of a matrix in BH(n, 4) implies that
BH(2n, 2) is nonempty [2]. More recently, Compton, Craigen and de Launey proved that a
matrix in BH(n, 6) with no entries in {1, −1} implies that BH(4n, 2) is nonempty [3]. The
first author and Egan unified and generalised these results, giving sufficient conditions for
the existence of a matrix in BH(n, k) and a matrix in M ∈ BH(m, ℓ) to imply the existence
of a matrix in BH(mn, ℓ) [4]. The most substantial conditions in these constructions are
on the spectrum of the matrix M. In [5], the authors of this paper and Egan proved the
existence of a real Hadamard matrix with minimal polynomial Φ2t+1 (x), which implies that,
t−1
whenever there exists H ∈ BH(n, 2t ), there exists a real Hadamard matrix of order 22 −1 n.
Perhaps the strongest of these recent results is due to Östergård and Paavola [9], who
prove that a matrix in BH(n, pk) can be used to construct a matrix in BH(pn, k), provided
that k = pα q β for primes p and q with α ≥ 1. In this note, we will generalise this result,
removing the restriction on the number of primes dividing k, while also simplifying the proof.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that H ∈ BH(n, k), and p is a prime such that p2 | k. Then
there exists H ′ ∈ BH(np, k/p).
This result generalizes easily to the following.
Theorem 1.2. Let k = mt, where each prime divisor of k also divides t. If there exists
a matrix in BH(n, k), then there exists a matrix in BH(mn, t).
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 1.1,
from which Theorem 1.2 essentially follows immediately. We conclude with a short discussion
of obstructions to generalising Theorem 1.2 further by similar techniques.
2. Proof of the main result
Throughout this section, we will use the following conventions: k is a fixed positive
integer and p is a prime such that p2 divides k. For any positive integer t, we write ζt for a
primitive tth root of unity.
Given a field K, we say that a ∈ K is a pth power (in K) if there exists x ∈ K such
that xp = a, and we write K p for the set of pth powers in K. We will require the following
sufficient condition for the polynomial xn − a to be irreducible over K.
Lemma 2.1. [7, Chapter VI, Theorem 9.1] Let K be a field, and let n ≥ 2 an integer with
prime divisors p1 , p2 , . . . , pd . Let a ∈ K/ ∪di=1 K pi . If 4 | n we also require that a ∈
/ −4K 4 .
Then xn − a is irreducible in K[x].
Let t = k/p. The following p × p matrix features
we record its definition below.

Lemma 2.2. Let p be a prime divisor of the positive integer k, and let ζk be a primitive
k root of unity. Write t = k/p and set ζt to be a primitive tth root of unity. Then
th

ψk,p : ζki 7→ Mk,p

defines an isomorphism of Q-algebras, ψk,p : Q[ζk ] → Q[Mk,p ].
Proof. If t = k/p, the field Q[ζk ] is a p-dimensional extension of Q[ζt ] and is isomorphic
to Q[x]/hf (x)i, where f (x) = xp − ζt . Note that f (x) is irreducible over Q[ζt ] by Lemma

2.1. The minimal polynomial of the matrix Mk,p is also f (x), and so Q[ζk ] ∼
= Q[Mk,p ].
Next, we will lift this embedding of fields to an embedding of matrix algebras.
Lemma 2.3. Let ψ be a function defined entrywise on a matrix in Mn (Q[ζk ]) by

so that Aψ ∈ Mnp (Q[ζt ]). Then ψ is a homomorphism of matrix algebras.

Proof. Let A = (ai,j ), B = (bi,j ) ∈ Mn (Q[ζk ]). It suffices to check that ψ preserves
matrix addition, the conjugate transpose operation ∗, and matrix multiplication. Then,

It follows from Lemma 2.3 that if M, N ∈ Mn (Q[ζk ]) are such that MN ∗ = In then
M ψ (N ∗ )ψ = (MN ∗ )ψ = Ink .
It is well-known that BH(p, p) is always nonempty. It contains, for example, the Discrete
Fourier Matrix of order p:
Fp = ζpij



0≤i,j≤p−1

where ζp denotes a primitive pth root of unity. In general, character tables of abelian groups
give rise to Butson-Hadamard matrices, and the Discrete Fourier Matrix is such an example
for a cyclic group of order p.
Definition 2.4. If ψ is the entrywise application of ψk,p , H ∈ BH(n, k), and C ∈
BH(p, p), then we define
H(H, C, ψ) := H ψ · (In ⊗ C),
where In ⊗ C is the Kronecker product.
Note that by definition the matrix In ⊗ C will be a block diagonal matrix with each block
equal to C. We will now prove Theorem 1.1, which generalises [9, Theorem 4].
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let k be a positive integer such that p2 | k for some prime
p and let t = k/p. Let ψ := ψk,p , H ∈ BH(n, k), and C ∈ BH(p, p). We will show that
H(H, C, ψ) ∈ BH(np, t). Observe first that H(H, C, ψ) is a block matrix, and by definition
i
every block is of the form Mk,p
C for some i. Since Mk,p is a monomial matrix whose nonzero
th
entries are t roots of unity and all the entries of C are pth roots of unity, the entries of
H(H, C, ψ) are all products of tth and pth roots of unity. Since by assumption p2 | k, we
have ζp ∈ Q[ζt ], and hence every entry of H(H, C, ψ) is a tth root of unity. It now suffices to

check that the Gram matrix has the required form. Using Lemma 2.3, we have
∗
H(H, C, ψ) · H(H, C, ψ)∗ = H ψ · (In ⊗ C) · H ψ · (In ⊗ C)
∗
= H ψ · (In ⊗ C) · (In ⊗ C)∗ · H ψ
∗
= H ψ · (In ⊗ C) · (In ⊗ C ∗ ) · H ψ
∗
= H ψ · (In ⊗ CC ∗ ) · H ψ
∗
= H ψ · (In ⊗ p · Ip ) · H ψ
∗
= p · Hψ · Hψ
= p · (H · H ∗ )ψ
= p · (n · In )ψ
= np · Inp .
The result follows.

We can now prove Theorem 1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let k = mt, and write m = p1 p2 . . . pd as a product of (not
necessarily distinct) primes. By hypothesis, BH(n, k) is nonempty. Applying Theorem 1.1
Q
Q
repeatedly, we obtain matrices in the sets BH(n ci=1 pi , t di=c+1 pi ) for c = 1, 2, . . . , d. 

Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 do not allow us to eliminate a prime divisor from k. If one constructs
a matrix Mk,p , where p divides k and p2 does not, then, since p is coprime to k/p, the map
ζ 7→ ζ p permutes the primitive (k/p)th roots of unity, so there exists ζ ′ such that (ζ ′ )p −
ζk/p = 0, and the minimal polynomial of Mk,p has a linear factor. Then we do not obtain
a homomorphism in Lemma 2.2, and none of the remaining proof follows. It is instructive
to consider the problem of constructing homomorphisms ψ : Q[ζp ] → Q (equivalent to
constructing morphisms from BH(n, p) onto real Hadamard matrices); as of writing, the only
examples known have k = 2α for some α. This is because the only irreducible polynomials
α
over Q with precisely two non-zero terms (and constant term ±1) are of the form x2 + 1.
Parity obstructions also arise: suppose that we had a monomial matrix P with minimal

polynomial xx−1
, then we could have

But each P i C is a Hadamard matrix, and the number of terms in the sum is odd, so no
entry in the matrix can vanish. One could perhaps circumvent the restriction of binomial
minimal polynomials by considering arbitrary matrices K1 , . . . , Kt and L1 , . . . , Lt such that
Ki L∗j is complex Hadamard for each pair 1 ≤ i, j ≤ t; such constructions have been considered by McNulty and Weigert [8] for example. We leave this as a direction for future research.
