Abstract In this paper, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is integrated
with power splitting based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT-PS) and cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (CNOMASWIPT-PS) downlink transmission, called as CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM. The
proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme enhances the spectral efficiency
and energy efficiency as well. The SWIPT-PS will energize the relaying operation from cell center user (CCU) to cell edge user (CEU). Different symbols
are transmitting towards the users simultaneously from the base station by
utilizing different OAM modes on the time slot of relaying (CCU to CEU)
for CNOMA-SWIPT-PS. The CCU, CEU and sum capacities and energy efficiency of the proposed scheme over Rician fading channels are investigated
in this paper. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes over existing schemes and conventional orthogonal multiple access based scheme are
demonstrated through the result analysis.

1 Introduction
Spectral efficiency along with energy efficiency (EE) are two vital challenges
that need to be satisfied among the several requirements to achieve the upcoming challenges of the future wireless networks [1,2]. To deal with these
challenges non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) can be integrated. Moreover,
by utilizing the different modes of orbital angular momentum (OAM), additional symbols can be transferred to cell center user (CCU) and cell edge user
(CEU) to enhance the channel capacities as well. These are the main focus of
this paper.
NOMA is an interesting and suitable solution to enhance spectral efficiency
and serve a large number of users [3,4]. In NOMA based system, the users
are served simultaneously by the same code at the same frequency, time but
different power levels. Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is used at
the received end to separate the superimposed messages transmitted by the
source [5].
Cooperative relaying is an effective way to enhance the reliability and coverage area by utilizing CCU as a relay for the CEU or using a dedicated relay
which assists the NOMA users [6-9]. In general, the user closer from the base
station (BS) is called CCU and the user further from BS is called CEU. NOMA
with cooperative relaying is known as cooperative NOMA (CNOMA) [7-9].
Furthermore, RF signals can be utilized to energize the energy-constrained
nodes. [10-11] This will enhance the battery lifetime by utilizing the SWIPT
technique [12]. SWIPT, which can extract energy and information simultaneously from the ambient RF signals using power splitting or time switching
receiver architecture, can provide RF energy harvesting (EH) at the energyconstrained nodes [13].
In present research work, CNOMA and SWIPT are integrated together
which is known as CNOMA-SWIPT to provide spectral efficiency and energy
efficiency as well [14-15]. CNOMA-SWIPT protocol can be categorized into
two different types. In the first type, the CCU which is an energy-constrained
node is used as a relay for the CEU [15-18]. In the second type, energy harvesting is used for the dedicated relay which relaying information for all NOMA
users. The first type of CNOMA-SWIPT is the main consideration of this paper since dedicated relay is not available in every cases [19-20]. In the previous
works, the ergodic sum capacity and outage probabilities are analyzed for the
CNOMA-SWIPT protocol [21-22]. In the work of Kader et. al. [22], two novel
cooperative spectrum sharing protocols, i.e., time switching (TS) and power
splitting (PS), were investigated for CNOMA-SWIPT, where dedicated relay
is used as an energy-constrained relay for the CEU. The ergodic sum capacity
(ESC) and outage probabilities (OP) are analyzed for the CNOMA-SWIPT
over Nakagami-m fading channel. In the work of Shah et. al. [23], a CNOMASWIPT protocol was proposed over Rayleigh fading channels. Whereas the
source is communicating with the user with a backscattering node and an EH
based decode and forwards (DF) relay technique. Moreover, in [24], a trans-

mit antenna selection scheme based on CNOMA-hybrid SWIPT protocol was
proposed over the Rayleigh fading channel as well. Furthermore, the source
is communicating with two users simultaneously via the support of an EH
based decode and forwards (DF) relay technique. Furthermore, R. Jiao et. al.
analyze the capacity of CNOMA over the Rician fading channel. However,
the capacity enhancement and empowering the relaying node to enhance the
energy efficiency are not analyzed to fulfill the requirements of the upcoming
cellular communication system [25].
Considering all the above techniques, a suitable solution is required to
energize the relay operation and provides enhanced channel capacity simultaneously without any additional resources. That is why CNOMA downlink
transmission with PS based SWIPT protocol (CNOMA-SWIPT-PS) is a viable solution for simplicity and provides better capacities than TS as well [22].
So, CNOMA-SWIPT-PS is considered in this paper to energize the relay operation. OAM utilizes a new degree of freedom which is known as OAM mode
for signal transmission [26-27]. Moreover, OAM exploits the phase variation
with respect to the azimuth angle of the propagated electromagnetic waves. To
enhance the capacity of CNOMA-SWIPT-PS, OAM is a potential candidate
to transmit different symbols by utilizing different modes of OAM simultaneously to enhance the channel capacities without any interference [26-28]. That
is why a novel scheme is proposed here by utilizing the time slot of relaying
in the case of CNOMA-SWIPT-PS protocol. Two different additional symbols will be transmitted by different OAM modes towards the users from the
base station (BS) by utilizing the same time slot for relaying from CCU to
CEU. This proposed scheme can enhance the capacity of the CNOMA with
PS SWIPT protocol without any interference and this scheme does not any
required additional resources (e.g. time slot or frequency band) as well. Moreover, energy efficiency (EE) will be also enhanced by utilizing the proposed
technique as well. The principal contribution of this paper is given below:
– PS based CNOMA-SWIPT-PS is considered over the Rician fading channel.
– OAM is integrated with CNOMA-SWIPT-PS protocol to achieve higher
channel capacities. The proposed scheme of OAM with CNOMA-SWIPTPS is mentioned as CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM in this paper.
– To analyze the capacity enhancement of the proposed CNOMA-SWIPTPS-OAM scheme, capacity of CCU, the capacity of CEU, and sum capacity
(SC) are analyzed and investigated. Moreover, the capacities of the proposed scheme are compared with CNOMA based conventional SWIPT protocols (CNOMA-SWIPT-PS and CNOMA-SWIPT-TS) and conventional
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based SWIPT-PS with OAM (OMASWIPT-PS-OAM) as well.
– EE is another performance analysis metric that is analyzed here as well.
Hence the EE comparison for the proposed scheme is compared with CNOMA
and OMA based conventional SWIPT protocols as well.

proposed scheme is analyzed and compared with CNOMA-SWIPT-PS,
CNOMA-SWIPT-TS, and OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM as well to analyze the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM system model and the proposed protocol
as well. The capaciti analysis and OMA based SWIPT-PS scheme are also
presented in this section. Section 3 exhibits numerical results. This paper is
concluded in Section 4.

2 System Model
A two-phase CNOMA-SWIPT-PS network with a BS which is considered as
a source and two users (a CCU and a CEU) is considered. The BS directly
communicates with the CCU called U E1 and CEU called U E2 as well. There
is two line of sight (LOS) links that are considered from BS to U E1 and U E2
accordingly to send additional symbols directly to the users as well by different OAM modes. To enhance the data reliability at U E2 and enhance the
coverage area, U E1 perform the energy harvested based decode and forward
(DF) relaying from U E1 to U E2 . The proposed network model is shown in
Figure 1. Hereafter, subscript s, 1 and 2 denote BS, U E1 and U E2 respectively. Assume that the channel coefficient hp,q between any two nodes p and
q (p, qǫ{s, U E1 , U E2 } and i 6= j) is subjected to Rician fading plus Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Whereas, Ωs,1 , Ωs,2 , and Ω1,2 are the average power of BS to U E1 , BS to U E2 , and U E1 to U E2 relay link respectively,
where Ωs,2 < Ωs,1 [25]. The total transmits power of S for direct transmissions (NOMA and OAM) and power transmit from U E1 for relaying are denoted by P and P1 respectively. Moreover, ls,1 and ls,2 are two different OAM
modes as well to transmit additional symbols to U E1 and U E2 respectively
from the BS to enhance the capacities. The data communication policy along
with the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model of the proposed
CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme are discussed explicitly in section 2.1 and
2.2, respectively.

2.1 CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM
In this strategy, it is considered that U E1 acts as a PS based EH relay. Moreover, additional symbols are transmitted to the users as well by utilizing different OAM modes. The proposed system model and protocol summary are
presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively. T is the total duration of downlink transmission of the CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme which is shown in
Figure 2.

2.1.1 Phase-1
Following the principle
√ of downlink
√ NOMA, BS transmits a superimposed
composite signal A = pN P x1 + pF P x2 for a duration of T /2, where x1 , x2
are the data symbols and pN , pF are power allocating factors respectively. Note
that x1 , pN and x2 , pF are assigned to U E1 and U E2 , respectively. Moreover,
the received power at U E1 is split in the ratio of δP : (1 − δ)P (0 ≤ δ ≤ 1),
where δP and (1 − δ)P are for EH and information decoding (ID) respectively
[22]. The transmitted power P1 of U E1 by harvested energy for DF relaying
is given below
2

P1 = ηδP |hs,1 | .

(1)

Where, η is the energy conversion efficiency, where 0 ≤ η ≤ 1 [14,18,22,24].
The received signals at U E1 and U E2 are respectively given by,
p
p
y1 = ( pN (1 − δ)P x1 + pF (1 − δ)P x2 )|hs,1 |2 + n1 ,

where n1 ∼ CN (0, σ 2 ) and n2 ∼ CN (0, σ 2 ) are the complex AWGN at
U E1 and U E2 respectively with zero mean and variance σ 2 . According to the
downlink NOMA protocol, U E1 first decodes x2 and then performs SIC to
decode own symbol x1 [22]. Thus, the received SINR at U E1 for x2 and x1 are
respectively given by following equations
γxt11 = (1 − δ)ρ|hs,1 |2 pN ,

where ρ , σP2 is the transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by BS and γxt12 →x1
denotes the required SINR to decode symbol x2 . Afterwards, U E2 can obtain
x2 directly by treating x1 as noise. Therefore the received SINR at U E2 for
x2 can be derived by following equation
γxt12 =

ρ|hs,2 |2 (1 − δ)pF

ρ|hs,2 |2 (1 − δ)pN + 1

Note that pN + pF = 1 − δ and pN < pF [22].

2.1.2 Phase-2
This phase is consists of cooperative DF relaying and BS transmits additional
symbols to the U E1 and U E2 by different OAM modes to the users. The
cooperative DF relay transmission from U E1 to U E2 and additional symbol
transmission directly by different OAM modes from BS are performed on the
remaining T − T /2 = T /2 duration. The cooperative relay is performed by
U E1 . U E1 transmits the decoded symbol xˆ2 to U E2 by utilizing the harvested
energy. The received signal at U E2 by DF relaying is expressed below
p
(7)
yˆ2 = P1 xˆ2 |h1,2 |2 + n2 .
Therefore, the received SINR at U E2 by DF relaying is obtained as below
γxt22 = ρηδ|hs,1 |2 |h1,2 |2 .

(8)

√
y4 = ( P x4 )|hs,2,(ls,2 ) |2 + n2 .

(10)

Two additional symbols x3 for U E1 and x4 for U E2 by using different√LOS
channels to U E1 and U E
√2 respectively from BS. BS transmit signal B = P x3
to U E1 and signal D = P x4 to CEU for a duration of T /2 simultaneously. To
mitigate the interference issue and effective transmission two different OAM
modes ls,1 and ls,2 are considered for U E1 and U E2 respectively. The LOS
channel coefficient hy,z (ly,z ) between any two nodes y and (y, zǫ{s, U E1, U E2 }
and y 6= z) is subjected to LOS channel. The received signal at U E1 and U E2
from the BS by different OAM modes are given below
√
(9)
y3 = ( P x3 )|hs,1,(ls,1 ) |2 + n1 .

Accordingly, the received SINR for symbol x3 at U E1 can be expressed as
[27-31]
(11)
γxt23 = ρµ1 ,
where µ1 is the singular value of the channel response matrix (hs,1,(ls,1 ) ) of
CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM system [22,27,30]. OAM beam has divergence in
its high-intensity region which caused attenuation [27-30]. By using Fresnelzone-plate lenses antenna at BS, this issue can be mitigated without affecting
the helical phase profile of OAM beam [27-30]. So, similarly the received SINR
for symbol x4 at U E2 can be expressed as [29-31]
γxt24 = ρµ2 ,

(12)

where similarly as before µ2 is the singular value of the channel response
matrix (hs,2,(ls,2 ) ) of the proposed system [22,27,30].
2.2 Achievable capacity analysis
By considering normalized total time duration (T = 1). The equations for the
capacities are derived in following segments.

8

Ahmed Al Amin et al.

2.2.1 Capacity of U E1
x1 and x3 are received by U E1 . So, the achievable capacity of U E1 is obtained
as below by (4) and (11),
CUE1 =

1
1
log2 (1 + γxt11 ) + log2 (1 + γxt23 ).
2
2

(13)

2.2.2 Capacity of U E2
Using (5), (6), (8) and (12) the achievable capacity of U E2 for x2 and x4 can
be achieved by following equation,
CUE2 =

1
1
log2 (1 + min(γxt12 →x1 , γxt12 , γxt22 )) + log2 (1 + γxt24 ).
2
2

(14)

2.2.3 Sum Capacity
So, the SC can be achieved by following equation [27]
Csum = CUE1 + CUE2 .

(15)

Whereas, CUE1 and CUE2 are the capacity of U E1 and U E2 for the proposed
CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM technique.
2.3 Energy Efficiency of CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM
Energy efficiency is the ratio of ergodic sum channel capacity (Csum ) and the
total transmitted power by the BS for direct transmissions and transmission
power from CCU for relaying. BS transmits P amount of power for direct transmissions for NOMA from BS. For additional symbol transmission by different
OAM modes to the users from BS, P amount of power is also transmitted from
BS as well. U E1 transmit P1 for DF relaying from U E1 to U E2 . So the EE
can be derived as below for the proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM [34-35],
EE =

Csum
.
2P + P1

(16)

2.4 OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM
For a fair comparison with the prposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme,
OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme is also devised in this paper as benchmark.
For the OMA case, time division multiple access (TDMA) is considered here.
In this case, BS transmits information signal for U E1 and U E2 independently
in different time slots with total transmit power P . The different time slots
allocated for U E1 and U E2 for different symbols (e.g. x1 , x2 , x3 and x4 ) and
DF relaying of x2 are denoted as t1 , t2 , t3 , and t4 respectively. Moreover, PS

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

based SWIPT is considered at U E1 [16,18,22]. Hence, U E1 utilizes the fraction
δ of the received power for energy harvesting and the remaining 1 − δ fraction
for ID [18,22,27]. So different transmission for x1 , x2 and DF relaying of x2
utilizes single time slot for each transmission. Such as x1 transmitted from BS
to U E1 in t1 along with PS SWIPT based energy harvesting at U E1 . x2 is
transmitting from BS to U E2 in t2 . Furthermore, DF relaying transmission of
x2 by utilizing the harvested energy from U E1 to U E2 is perform in t3 . The
transmission of x3 and x4 by different OAM modes (ls,1 and ls,2 ) are performed
in t4 . Because without interference by using different modes of OAM, different
symbols can be transmitted to the users in same time slot (t4 ). Moreover, since
T = 1 is considered here, so total time slot is equally splitted for each time
slot for OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM technique. Hence, t1 = t2 = t3 = t4 = 41 are
considered here, which are the duration of each time slot. So, the achievable
capacity of U E1 and U E2 can be achieved as below for the OMA-SWIPT-PSOAM technique [5,27,33]

3 Numerical Results
In this section, results for the user capacities, SC and EE of the proposed
protocol and techniques are examined and explained. The impact of changes
in transmit SNR ρ, allowed power splitting factor δ, distance ds,1 between
BS and U E1 on the performance of the considered system are discussed.
Collinear placement of all nodes (e.g. BS, U E1 , and U E2 ) and normalized
distances between any two nodes are considered, where ds,1 = 0.5, ds,2 = 1,
and d1,2 = 1 − ds,1 . (Ωs,2 = 9) < (Ωs,1 = Ω1,2 = 36) are considered for simulation [25,27]. Furthermore, normalized P = 1, normalized T = 1, ls,1 = 2
and ls,2 = 1 are considered here for simulation purpose. For performance

comparison, simulation results for CCU (U E1 ) capacity, CEU (U E2 ) capacity and SC of CNOMA-SWIPT-PS, CNOMA-SWIPT-TS, CNOMA-SWIPTPS-OAM, and OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM are also provided. Note that similar
simulation parameters are considered for the proposed and other compared
schemes for consistency.

3.1 User Capacities and Sum Capacity
The impact of ρ, ds,1 and δ on the capacity of CCU, CEU, and SC of the
proposed system is shown in this part. All figures are plotted for the parameters
Ks,1 = K1,2 = 5, and Ks,2 = 2 due to Rician fading channel [25,27].
CCU (U E1 ) capacity behavior with respect to (w.r.t) transmit SNR ρ is
demonstrated in Figure 3 for the proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme
and compared with CNOMA-SWIPT-PS, CNOMA-SWIPT-TS, and OMASWIPT-PS-OAM schemes [22]. Parameters pN = 0.4, pF = 0.6, η = 0.7,
δ = 0.3, ds,1 = 0.5, ds,2 = 1, and d1,2 = 1 − ds,1 are set during the simulation purpose. CCU capacity of all schemes increases linearly with an increase
of ρ. CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM exhibits far better performance than other
schemes in case of CCU capacity because of additional symbol transmission
from BS to CCU by an OAM mode (ls,1 ). In the case of OMA-SWIPT-PSOAM, CCU capacity is degraded than the proposed scheme due to using a
dedicated time slot for each separate transmission from BS to CCU, excluding
OAM based transmission.
Figure 4 represents CEU (U E2 ) capacity behavior w.r.t transmit SNR ρ
for the proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM and compared with CNOMASWIPT-PS, CNOMA-SWIPT-TS, and OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM schemes as
well. Parameters pN = 0.4, pF = 0.6, η = 0.7, δ = 0.3, ds,1 = 0.5, ds,2 = 1, and
d1,2 = 1 − ds,1 are set during the simulation purpose as before. CEU capacity
of all schemes increases linearly with increasing values of ρ. Figure 4 illustrates
that in the case of CEU, the proposed scheme (CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM)
provides higher CEU capacity than other schemes as well. Similarly as before, an additional symbol is transmitting by utilizing the OAM beam with
different OAM mode (ls,2 ) on the time slot for relaying. Hence, the capacity
is enhanced for the proposed technique at CEU. In the case of OMA-SWIPTPS-OAM, CEU capacity is degraded than the proposed scheme due to using
a dedicated time slot for each separate transmission from BS to CEU like as
CCU, excluding OAM based transmission.
Figure 5 shows SC behavior w.r.t transmit SNR ρ for the proposed CNOMASWIPT-PS-OAM and compared with CNOMA-SWIPT-PS, CNOMA-SWIPTTS, and OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM schemes as well. Parameters pN = 0.4, pF =
0.6, η = 0.7, δ = 0.3, ds,1 = 0.5, ds,2 = 1, and d1,2 = 1 − ds,1 are set
during the simulation purpose as before. Figure 5 illustrates that SC of all
schemes increases linearly with the increasing values of ρ. Moreover, the proposed technique (CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM) provides higher SC than other
conventional techniques as well. The higher SC is achieved by utilizing the dif-

are significantly higher than other existing schemes which is shown in Figure
3 and Figure 4. As a result, the SC of the proposed system is also enhanced
significantly. In the case of OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM, SC is lower than the proposed scheme because the capacities of CCU and CEU are comparatively lower
than the proposed scheme (Which are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4).
In Figure 6, the SC w.r.t ds,1 is plotted for CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM
and compared with CNOMA-SWIPT-PS, CNOMA-SWIPT-TS, and OMASWIPT-PS-OAM schemes as well. Parameters pN = 0.4, pF = 0.6, η = 0.7,
δ = 0.3, and ρ = 15dB are set during the simulation purpose. Figure 6 shows
that due to increasing values of ds,1 , the SC is decreasing for all cases. This
is happening because due to increasing values of ds,1 , the channel condition
between BS and CCU is degraded. Moreover, pN is lower than pF as well due
to NOMA [22]. So, CCU cannot decode the information properly due to the
degradation of the channel from BS to CCU. Figure 6 also illustrates that
due to the increase of ds,1 , the SC of the proposed scheme is comparatively
higher than other conventional schemes. Due to the increasing values of ds,1 ,
the channel condition between BS to CCU is degrading as well. But due to
the simultaneous transmission of additional symbols from BS to the users
by different OAM modes is performed on the time duration of relaying. So,
the achieved SC of the proposed scheme is significantly higher than other
techniques due to the increasing values of ds,1 . Due to utilizing the separate
time slot for each transmission, except OAM based transmission. So, the OMA-

SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme provides comparatively lower SC w.r.t ds,1 than the
proposed scheme which is illustrated in Figure 6 as well.
In Figure 7, the influence of δ over SC is plotted for CNOMA-SWIPTPS-OAM and compared with CNOMA-SWIPT-PS, CNOMA-SWIPT-TS, and
OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM schemes as well. Parameters pN = 0.4, pF = 0.6,
η = 0.7, ds,1 = 0.5,ds,2 = 1, d1,2 = 1 − ds,1 , and ρ = 15dB are set during
the simulation purpose. Figure 7 illustrates that due to increasing values of δ,
the SC is decreasing for all schemes except CNMOMA-SWIPT-TS. Because in
case of TS based SWIPT, there is no impact of δ [22]. Because δP is only used
for energy harvesting for PS based SWIPT protocols. So, the higher values of
δP can enhance the harvested energy for relaying. In contrast, the amount of
harvested energy ((1−δ)P ) for information decoding (ID) decreases as well for
increasing values of δ. Hence, the information cannot decode properly at CCU.
As a result, the SC is decreased for the increasing values of δ. Figure 7 shows
that the proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM provides better SC than other
schemes for different values of δ. Because the additional information transmission from BS to the users by different OAM modes can enhance the SC of the
proposed scheme than other compared schemes significantly. Due to utilizing
the separate time slot for each transmission except OAM based transmission,
the OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme provides comparatively lower SC w.r.t δ
than the proposed scheme which is illustrated in Figure 7 as before.

3.2 Energy Efficiency
EE shows the ratio of SC and total transmitted power. Impact of ρ, ds,1 and δ
on EE of the proposed scheme is shown in this part. All figures are plotted for
the parameters Ks,1 = K1,2 = 5, and Ks,2 = 2 due to Rician fading channel
[25,27].
EE w.r.t transmit SNR ρ is demonstrated in Figure 8 for the proposed
CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM and compared with CNOMA-SWIPT-PS, CNOMASWIPT-TS, and OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM schemes [22]. Parameters pN = 0.4,
pF = 0.6, η = 0.7, δ = 0.3, ds,1 = 0.5, ds,2 = 1, and d1,2 = 1 − ds,1 are
set during the simulation purpose as before. The EE is going downwards due
to the increasing number of transmit SNR ρ for every case. The transmitted
power for relaying by the harvested energy is higher at CCU for higher values
of ρ. That is why the EE is decreasing for higher ρ in all cases. Moreover, the
proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme provides higher EE than other
schemes due to higher SC can be achieved by different OAM mode based
transmission from BS to the users. So, Figure 8 illustrates that the proposed
technique provides significantly higher EE than other conventional techniques
as well. Because the SC is higher for the proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM
technique than other compared schemes which is shown in Figure 5. Moreover,
the PS based SWIPT provides higher EE than TS based SWIPT for CNOMA
as well which is also shown in Figure 8 as well. Due to utilizing the separate
time slot for each transmission except OAM based transmission, the OMA-

Fig. 10: EE comparisons with respect to δ; Ks,1 = Ks,2 = 5, Ks,2 = 2,
pN = 0.4, pF = 0.6, P = 1, ls,1 = 2, ls,2 = 1, η = 0.7, ds,1 = 0.5, ds,2 = 1 and
ρ = 15dB.

In Figure 9, the EE w.r.t ds,1 is plotted for CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM
and compared with CNOMA-SWIPT-PS, CNOMA-SWIPT-TS, and OMASWIPT-PS-OAM schemes as well. Parameters pN = 0.4, pF = 0.6, η = 0.7,
δ = 0.3, and ρ = 15dB are set during the simulation purpose. The EE is
increasing for all cases in Figure 9. This happens because of the increasing
value of ds,1 causes a reduction of transmit power for relaying (P1 ) at CCU
due to degradation of channel conditions between BS and CCU. The EE is
significantly higher for the proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme than
other schemes which is shown in Figure 9. Because according to Figure 6, the
SC of the proposed scheme is significantly higher than other schemes due to
additional symbol transmission from BS to the users by different OAM modes.
Due to utilizing the separate time slot for each transmission except OAM based
transmission, the OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme provides significantly lower
EE than the proposed scheme w.r.t ds,1 which is illustrated in Figure 9.
In Figure 10, the impact of δ over EE is plotted for CNOMA-SWIPTPS-OAM and compared with CNOMA-SWIPT-PS, CNOMA-SWIPT-TS, and
OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM schemes as well. Parameters pN = 0.4, pF = 0.6,
η = 0.7, ds,1 = 0.5, ds,2 = 1, d1,2 = 1 − ds,1 , and ρ = 15dB are set during the
simulation purpose. The EE is decreasing for increasing value of δ. According
to Figure 7, SC is decreasing for increasing values of δ. Moreover, Figure 7
shows that the proposed CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM provides better SC than
other schemes for different values of δ as well. The additional information
transmission by different OAM modes boosts up the SC of the proposed scheme

than other schemes significantly. As a result, the EE is higher for the proposed
scheme than other schemes which is shown in Figure 10. In addition, there is no
impact of δ on SC of CNMOMA-SWIPT-TS. Because δ is only used for energy
harvesting for PS based SWIPT protocols [22]. So there is no impact of δ on
EE of CNMOMA-SWIPT-TS scheme as well. Due to utilizing the separate
time slot for each transmission except OAM based transmission, the OMASWIPT-PS-OAM scheme provides significantly lower EE than the proposed
scheme w.r.t δ which is illustrated in Figure 10.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, the CNOMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM scheme has been proposed to
enhance the capacities and energy efficiency of PS SWIPT based CNOMA
downlink transmission. Moreover, OMA-SWIPT-PS-OAM and other two conventional schemes such as CNOMA-SWIPT-PS and CNOMA-SWIPT-TS are
also compared with the proposed scheme for a fair comparison. According
to result analysis, it is shown that the proposed scheme provides better performance compared to other conventional schemes in terms of capacities and
energy efficiency. In the future, the work can be extended by incorporating
amplify and forward relay assisted CNOMA with the proposed scheme.
