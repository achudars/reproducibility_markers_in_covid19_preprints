ABSTRACT

In the upcoming decade large astronomical surveys will discover millions of transients raising
unprecedented data challenges in the process. Only the use of the machine learning algorithms
can process such large data volumes. Most of the discovered transients will belong to the known
classes of astronomical objects. However, it is expected that some transients will be rare or
completely new events of unknown physical nature. The task of finding them can be framed as
an anomaly detection problem. In this work, we perform for the first time an automated anomaly
detection analysis in the photometric data of the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), which serves
as a proof of concept for the applicability of these methods to future large scale surveys. The
analysis consists of the following steps: 1) data selection from the OSC and approximation
of the pre-processed data with Gaussian processes, 2) dimensionality reduction, 3) searching
for outliers with the use of the isolation forest algorithm, 4) expert analysis of the identified
outliers. The pipeline returned 81 candidate anomalies, 27 (33%) of which were confirmed to
be from astrophysically peculiar objects. Found anomalies correspond to a selected sample of
1.4% of the initial automatically identified data sample of ∼2000 objects. Among the identified
outliers we recognised superluminous supernovae, non-classical Type Ia supernovae, unusual
Type II supernovae, one active galactic nucleus and one binary microlensing event. We also
found that 16 anomalies classified as supernovae in the literature are likely to be quasars or
stars. Our proposed pipeline represents an effective strategy to guarantee we shall not overlook
exciting new science hidden in the data we fought so hard to acquire. All code and products of
this investigation are made publicly available‡.

INTRODUCTION

Supernovae (SNe) hold vital pieces of the large cosmic puzzle astronomy and cosmology aim to solve. They are responsible for the
chemical enrichment of interstellar medium (Nomoto et al. 2013);
the production of high energy cosmic rays (Morlino 2017), and
they trigger star formation via the density waves induced by their
energetic explosions (Nagakura et al. 2009; Chiaki et al. 2013).
Moreover, the study of different types of SNe allows us to probe the
composition and distance scale of the Universe (Kirshner & Kwan
1974; Hamuy & Pinto 2002; Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al.
1999) — imposing strong constraints on the standard cosmological
model (Betoule et al. 2014; Scolnic et al. 2018).
Given the potential impact of SN research on different areas
of astronomy, the scientific community has allocated a large fraction of its efforts in the generation of large supernova surveys —
a few recent examples include the Carnegie Supernova Project1
(CSP; Hamuy et al. 2006), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and
Rapid Response System2 (Pan-STARRS; Kaiser et al. 2010; Chambers et al. 2016), the Dark Energy Survey3 (DES; Dark Energy Survey Collaboration et al. 2016) and the Zwicky Transient Facility4
(ZTF; Bellm et al. 2019). Another generation of even larger counterparts, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope5 (LSST; LSST
Science Collaboration et al. 2009), will soon join this list, making available a combined data set of unprecedented volume and
complexity.
In this new data paradigm, the use of machine learning (ML)
methods is unavoidable (Ball & Brunner 2010). Astronomers have
already benefited from developments in machine learning, in particular for exoplanet search (McCauliff et al. 2015; Thompson et al.
2015; Pearson et al. 2018), but the synergy is far from that achieved
by other endeavours in genetics (Chen & Ishwaran 2012; Libbrecht
& Noble 2015; Quang & Xie 2016), ecology (Criscia et al. 2012) or
medicine (Venkatraghavan et al. 2019; Dubost et al. 2019). Moreover, given the relatively recent advent of large data sets, most of
the ML efforts in astronomy are concentrated in classification (e.g.,
Kessler et al. 2010; Ishida & de Souza 2013; Lochner et al. 2016;
Heinis et al. 2016; Ishida et al. 2019; Sooknunan et al. 2018) and
regression (e.g., Hildebrandt et al. 2010; Cavuoti et al. 2015; Vilalta
et al. 2017; Beck et al. 2017) tasks. Machine learning is also actively
applied for the real-bogus classification that allows to automatically
disentangle real transients from the artefacts on the images produced by major time-domain surveys (Bloom et al. 2012; Wright
et al. 2015; Goldstein et al. 2015; du Buisson et al. 2015). A large
variety of ML methods were applied to supervised photometric SN
classification problem (Richards et al. 2012; Sanders et al. 2015b;
Lochner et al. 2016; Möller et al. 2016; Charnock & Moss 2017;
Revsbech et al. 2018; Brunel et al. 2019; Pasquet et al. 2019; Möller
& de Boissière 2019) and unsupervised characterisation from spectroscopic observation (e.g., Rubin & Gal-Yam 2016; Sasdelli et al.
2016; Muthukrishna et al. 2019).
Astronomical anomaly detection has not been yet fully implemented in the enormous amount of data that has been gathered.
Barring a few exceptions, most of the previous studies can be divided into only two different trends: clustering (e.g., Rebbapragada
et al. 2009) and subspace analysis (e.g., Henrion et al. 2013) meth-

ods. More recently, random forest algorithms have been extensively
used by themselves (Baron & Poznanski 2017) or in hybrid statistical analysis (Nun et al. 2014). Although all of this has been done
to periodic variables there is not much done for transients and even
less for supernovae.
The lack of spectroscopic support causes the large supernova
databases to collect SN candidates basing on the secondary indicators (proximity to the galaxy, arise/decline rate on a light curve
(LC), absolute magnitude). This leads to the appearance of incorrectly classified objects. Anomaly detection can help us to purify
the supernova databases from the non-supernova contamination. It
is also expected that during such analysis the unknown variable
objects or SNe with unusual properties can be detected. As an example of unique objects one can refer to SN2006jc — SN with very
strong but relatively narrow He I lines in early spectra (∼30 similar
objects are known, Pastorello et al. 2016), SN2005bf — supernova
attributed to SN Ib but with two broad maxima on LCs (Folatelli
et al. 2006), SN2010mb — unusual SN Ic with very low decline
rate after the maximum brightness that is not consistent with radioactive decay of 56 Ni (Ben-Ami et al. 2014), ASASSN-15lh —
for some time it was considered as the most luminous supernova
ever observed — two times brighter than superluminous supernovae
(SLSN), later the origin of this object was challenged and now it is
considered as a tidal disruption of a main-sequence star by a black
hole (Dong et al. 2016; Leloudas et al. 2016). As such sources are
typically rare, the task of finding them can be framed as an anomaly
detection problem.
In this paper we turn to the automatic search for anomalies in the real photometric data using the Open Supernova Catalog6 (OSC, Guillochon et al. 2017). The OSC has never been
used for the task of the anomaly detection with the ML algorithms
until this work, however, it was used for the classification problem (Narayan et al. 2018; Muthukrishna et al. 2019). The anomalies
we are looking for are any artefacts in the data, cases of misclassification (active galactic nuclei (AGN), novae, binary microlensing
events), rare classes of objects (SLSN, kilonovae, SNe associated
with gamma-ray bursts), and objects of unknown nature. We use the
isolation forest as an outlier detection algorithm that identifies outliers instead of normal observations (Liu et al. 2012). This technique
is based on the fact that outliers are data points that are few and different. Similarly to random forest it is built on an ensemble of binary
(isolation) trees. The final goal of the presented work is to develop
some approach that allows to detect anomalies in huge amount of
data produced by time-domain surveys such as LSST. Due to the initial absence of any labelled data in transient databases, the algorithm
follows the paradigm of unsupervised learning. For this reason we
pretend that we do not have any labels in the OSC and we use only
the multicolour photometry. Moreover, the spectral classification
provided by the OSC is collected from different sources, including the preliminary classification from the astronomical telegrams7
where it can be based on one spectrum only, that is simply fitted by
SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007) to the closest supernova template.
Such rough classification can not give an information about peculiar
behaviour of the source, usually more detailed study is needed. On
the contrary, it is not necessary that all outliers found by machine are
real anomalies. That is why we also subject the outliers to the careful
astrophysical analysis using the publicly available information.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2

approximation by Gaussian processes (GP). The outlier detection
algorithm is presented in Section 4. Section 5 shows the results and

THE OPEN SUPERNOVA CATALOG

The data are drawn from the Open Supernova Catalog (Guillochon
et al. 2017). The catalog is constructed by combining many publicly
available data sources such as the Asiago Supernova Catalog (Barbon et al. 1999), the Gaia Photometric Science Alerts (Wyrzykowski
et al. 2012; Campbell et al. 2014), the Nearby Supernova Factory (Aldering et al. 2002), Pan-STARRS (Kaiser et al. 2010;
Chambers et al. 2016), the SDSS Supernova Survey (Sako et al.
2018), the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Light Curve
Catalogue (Tsvetkov et al. 2005), the Supernova Legacy Survey
(SNLS, Pritchet & SNLS Collaboration 2005; Astier et al. 2006),
the MASTER Global Robotic Net (Lipunov et al. 2010), the AllSky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN, Holoien et al.
2019), and the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF, Law
et al. 2009; Cao et al. 2016a) among others, as well as from individual publications. It represents an open repository for supernova
metadata, light curves, and spectra in an easily downloadable format. This catalog also includes some contamination from non-SN
objects.
Given the large number of objects and their diverse characteristics, this catalog is ideal for our goal of automatically identifying anomalies. It incorporates data for more than 5 × 104 SNe
candidates among which ∼1.2×104 objects have >10 photometric observations and ∼5×103 have spectra. For comparison, SDSS
supernova catalog contains only 4607 SNe candidates: 889 with
measured spectra (Sako et al. 2018).
The catalog stores the data in different photometric passbands.
To have a more homogeneous sample, we chose only those objects
that have LCs in BRI (Bessell 1990), g 0r 0i 0 or gri filters. The primed
system u 0 g 0r 0i 0 z 0 is defined in the natural system of the USNO 1-m
telescope. The SDSS magnitudes ugriz, however, are defined in the
natural system of the SDSS 2.5-m telescope. These two systems are
very similar and the coefficients of the transformation equations are
quite small (Fukugita et al. 1996; Tucker et al. 2006; Smith et al.
2007). We assume that g 0r 0i 0 filters are close enough to gri and
transform BRI to gri (see Sect. 3.1). We require a minimum of
three photometric points in each filter with a 3-day binning (Fig. 1).
Our experiments show that this threshold is enough to provide a
good reconstruction of the light curve — specially in cases where
photometric points are not homogeneously distributed among filters. This is natural consequence of the light curve approximation
procedure we adopted (Section 3.2) which takes into account the
correlation between photometric bands to guide the reconstruction
in sparsely populated filters. After this first cut, our sample consists
of 3197 objects (2026 objects in g 0r 0i 0 , 767 objects in gri, and 404
objects in BRI).
We downloaded the data from the GitHub page8 of the Astrocats project on June, 2018. The complete data set of 45162 objects
is located at http://snad.space/osc/sne.tar.lzma.

PRE-PROCESSING

In this section we describe how to get features for ML from the OSC
light curves. The pre-processing procedure includes several steps
that are described in detail in the subsections below and illustrated
by Fig. 1. First, we prepared the photometric data extracted from the
OSC; we transformed the magnitudes to the flux units, converted the
upper limits, and implemented 1-day time-binning. Then, we used
the Gaussian processes to approximate the photometric observations
in each filter. The objects with bad light curve approximations were
removed from the further analysis. After that, we transformed the
remaining light curves in BRI filters to gri. To have a homogeneous
input data, for each object we extracted its photometry in the range
[−20, +100] days relative to the maximum flux. We also kept the
kernel parameters of the Gaussian processes. All of this together
was subjected to the dimensionality reduction procedure using tSNE method (Maaten & Hinton 2008).
3.1

Filter transformation

In order to ensure maximum exploitation of the data at hand, we
convert the Bessel’s BRI into gri filters using the Lupton’s (2005)
transformation equations9 . These equations are derived by matching
SDSS DR4 photometry to Peter Stetson’s published photometry for
stars10 :

As we can see, there are several possibilities to obtain gri
light curves from the Bessel’s ones. Obviously, the accuracy of
the transformation increases with the number of available filters.
However, in the Open Supernova Catalog objects having photometry
only in two filters are more numerous than those having photometry
in three or four filters. Therefore, the less filters we use, the larger
sample of SNe candidates we obtain. First, we tried to use only
two Bessel’s filters. Prior to applying the filter transformation, we
approximated the LCs with Gaussian processes (see Sect. 3.2). To
evaluate the quality of transformation, with two filters only, we chose
a few objects with LCs available in both, Sloan and Bessel’s filters,
and compared the transformed gri with the original ones. As can be
seen from the Fig. 2, the results of comparison are unsatisfactory
for i filter. This indicated that at least one more filter had to be
added in the analysis. The same test showed that three filters (BRI)
are enough to adequately reproduce gri light curves (Fig. 2). Since
with 3 filters the equations become over-determined, we used the
least-square method to solve Eq. 1.
Despite the fact that the transformation between the filters
depends on the spectrum of an object, and Lupton’s equations are
derived for stars, not for supernovae, the Fig. 2 shows quite good
agreement between transformed and original light curves.

3.2

Light curve approximation

Traditionally, ML algorithms require a homogeneous input data
matrix which, unfortunately, is not the case with supernovae. A
commonly used technique to transform unevenly distributed data
into an uniform grid is to approximate them with Gaussian processes (Rasmussen & Williams 2005). Usually, each light curve is
approximated by GP independently. However, in this study we use a
Multivariate Gaussian Process11 approximation. For each object it takes into account the correlation between light curves in
different bands, approximating the data by GP in all filters in a one
global fit (for details see Kornilov et al. 2019, in prep.). With this
technique we can reconstruct the missing parts of LC from its behaviour in other filters. For example, in Fig. 11 maximum in g filter
is reproduced from the r, i light curves. This correlation does not rely
on any physical assumptions about LC shape. As an approximation
range we chose [−20, +100] days. We also extrapolated the GP approximation to fill this range if needed. Once the GP approximation
becomes negative, it is zeroed till infinity.
Gaussian process is based on the so-called kernel, a function describing the covariance between two observations. The
kernel used in our implementation of Multivariate Gaussian

the parameters of Gaussian process to be found from the light curve
approximation. These length parameters describe the characteristic
time scale of correlation between observations. If the value of li is
too small the approximated light curve will be over-fitted and can
show unrealistic oscillations. To prevent it we set a lower limit on li
as the maximum time interval between two neighbouring observations, but not larger than 60 days. Also, Multivariate Gaussian
Process kernel includes 6 constants, three of which are unit variances of basis processes and three others describe their pairwise
correlations. Totally, Multivariate Gaussian Process has 9 parameters to be fitted.
Prior to applying the GP approximation, we prepare the
data (Fig. 1). First, we transform the magnitudes given by the Open
Supernova Catalog to fluxes and perform all further analysis in
the flux space only. Since measurements remote in time from the
maximum (mainly the upper limits or host detection) could potentially affect the GP behaviour, including the main part of light curve
around maximum, for each object we take only the points in the
interval [−240, +240] days relative to the maximum in r, r 0, R filter depending on the sub-sample. The Julian dates are rounded to
integers. We also implement 1-day time-binning to the data.

where wi is the weight of observation, w is the sum of weights,
hσi is the mean error, σw is the error of the weighted mean. If
the mean error is larger than the error of the weighted mean, then
observation errors are probably underestimated or the object is very
variable during the considered time interval. Upper limits are taken
into account only if there are no detections in the bin. In this case
we keep the most conservative upper limit, i.e. the one with the
smallest flux.
Since for each object the OSC assembles the photometry obtained by different telescopes with different limited magnitudes, a
lot of upper limits appeared in between or even simultaneously with
the real detections. This could also have an undesirable impact on
the Gaussian processes approximation. Therefore, for each filter we
keep only those upper limits which are later than the latest real
detection or earlier than the earliest real detection. Furthermore,
we reassign the values of these upper limits yup : the new values
are zeros with error equal to 3 × yup . This is done to decrease the
influence of too high upper limits on the GP approximation and to
force it to vanish for very early and very late times. Some particular
aspects of pre-processing are illustrated in Fig. 3.
Once the Multivariate Gaussian Process approximation
was done, we visually inspected the resulting light curves. Those
SNe with unsatisfactory approximation were removed from the sample (mainly the objects with bad photometric quality). The remaining BRI approximated light curves were then transformed to gri
(Sect. 3.1).
We consider the light curves in the observer frame. Since each
object has its own flux scale due to the different origin and different distance, we normalized the flux vector by its maximum
value. Based on the results of this approximation, for each object
we extracted the kernel parameters, the log-likelihood of the fit, LC
maximum and normalized photometry in the range of [−20, +100]
days with 1-day interval relative to the maximum. These values
were used as features for the ML algorithm (Sect. 4).
Our final sample consists of 1999 objects, ∼30% of which have
at least one spectrum in the OSC (see Fig. 4). The distribution of
these objects by astrophysical types is also shown in Fig. 4. The
classification is extracted from the OSC without any verification,
it can be photometric or based on one spectrum only. Less than
5% of our sample have <20 photometric points in all three filters.
The distributions of objects by redshift and by number of photometric points for the three sub-samples are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
The Fig. 5 contains only 1624 objects which significantly exceeds
the number of objects with the OSC spectra. The reason for such
discrepancy is that, first, the OSC collects also the photometric redMNRAS 000, 1–18 (2019)

Dimensionality Reduction

After the approximation procedure, each object has 374 features:
121×3 normalized fluxes, the LC flux maximum, 9 fitted parameters
of the Gaussian process kernel, and the log-likelihood of the fit.
We apply the outlier detection algorithm not only to the full data
set but also to the dimensionality-reduced data. The reason for this
is that the initial high dimensional feature space can be too sparse
for the successful performance of the isolation forest algorithm.
We applied t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton 2008), a variation of the
stochastic neighbour embedding method (Hinton & Roweis 2003),
for the dimensionality reduction of the data. In the t-SNE technique,
a nonlinear dimensionality reduction mapping is obtained so as
to keep distribution of distances between points undisturbed. This
ensures that if a point is anomalous in the sense that it is distant from
other points in the original data, it remains anomalous in the lower
dimension space. As a result of the dimentionality reduction, we
obtain 8 separate reduced data sets corresponding to 2 to 9 t-SNE
features (dimensions). Since t-SNE is a stochastic technique we have
also taken additional precautions to ensure that the resulting outlier
list does not depend on the t-SNE initial random state.

ISOLATION FOREST

Isolation forest (Liu et al. 2008, 2012) is an ensemble of random
isolation trees. Each isolation tree is a space partitioning tree similar
to the widely-known Kd-tree (Bentley 1975). However, in contrast
to the Kd-tree, a space coordinate (a feature) and a split value
are selected at random for every node of the isolation tree. This
algorithm leads to an unbalanced tree unsuitable for efficient spatial
search. However, the tree has the following important property: a
path distance between the root and the leaf is shorter on average
for points distant from "normal" data. This allows us to construct
enough random trees to estimate average root-leaf path distance for
every data sample that we have, and then rank the data samples
based on the path length. The anomaly score, defined in a range
[0, 1], is assigned to each object (see Eq. 2 in Liu et al. 2008). Then,
objects with the highest anomaly score — outliers — are selected
according to the contamination level which is a hyper-parameter of
the algorithm. The isolation forest algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 7.
We run the isolation forest algorithm on 10 data sets obtained
using the same photometric data (Fig. 1):
A) data set of 364 photometric characteristics (121×3 normalized
fluxes, the LC flux maximum),
B) data set of 10 parameters of the Gaussian process (9 fitted
parameters of the kernel, the log-likelihood of the fit),
C) 8 data sets obtained by reducing 374 features to 2–9 t-SNE
dimensions (Sect. 3.3).
For each data set we obtained a list of outliers. Contamination
levels were set to 1% (20 objects with highest anomaly score) for

contamination (40 objects with highest anomaly score). This larger
contamination was chosen to take into account the influence of the
dimensionality reduction step in the final data configuration. Given
different representations of the data and the stochastic nature of
the isolation forest algorithm, the same object can be assigned a

RESULTS

Applying the unsupervised learning to the photometric data extracted from the Open Supernova Catalog we found ∼100 outliers
among a total of 1999 objects (Fig. 1). However, not all of them are
necessary anomalies. That is why we also subject the outliers to the
careful astrophysical analysis. Using publicly available sources, we
collected information about each outlier and determined to which
kind of astrophysical objects it belongs — given the information we

could gather. Among the detected outliers there are few known cases
of miss-classifications, representatives of rare classes of SNe (e.g.,
superluminous supernovae, 91T-like SNe Ia) and highly reddened
objects. We also found that 16 anomalies classified as supernovae
by Sako et al. (2018), are likely to be quasars or stars.
Light curves with GP approximation for all 1999 objects can
be found at http://snad.space/osc/ and those who considered anomalous according to the criteria described in the previous section are
listed in Table A1. Names and equatorial coordinates of outliers are
shown in Columns 1-3; types in Column 4. CMB redshifts are presented in Column 5. Columns 6-8 contain the names and equatorial
coordinates of the corresponding host galaxies. Host morphological
types are displayed in Column 9. Columns 10 and 11 contain the
separation between center of the host and object in angular seconds
and kiloparsecs, respectively (to calculate the angular diameter distance we use a flat ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 ,
ΩΛ = 0.7). We give our comments and short description of each
object in Column 12. References are in Column 13. The most interesting of these objects are described below.

Peculiar SNe Ia

Type Ia supernova is an explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf
that exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit either by matter accretion from
a companion star or by merging with another white dwarf (Whelan &
Iben 1973; Iben & Tutukov 1984; Webbink 1984). SNe Ia are used as
universal distance ladder since their luminosity at maximum light is
approximately the same (Perlmutter et al. 1999; Riess et al. 1998).
However, the class of SNe Ia is not homogeneous, for example,
91T-like supernovae are on average 0.2–0.3 mag more luminous
than normal SNe Ia, have broader LCs, and different early spectrum
evolution (Filippenko et al. 1992b; Blondin et al. 2012); 91bg-like
supernovae are subluminous and fast-declining (Filippenko et al.
1992a); peculiar SNe Iax are spectroscopically similar to SNe Ia,
but have lower maximum-light velocities and typically lower peak
magnitudes (Foley et al. 2013). The presence of non-classical SNe Ia
in cosmological samples may introduce a systematic bias and affect
the cosmological analysis (e.g., Scalzo et al. 2012).

5.1.1

SN2002bj

SN2002bj was discovered in NGC 1821 on unfiltered CCD frames
taken with the Puckett Observatory 0.60-m automated patrol telescope on 2002 February 28.06 and March 1.05 UT, and on unfiltered
CCD LOTOSS images taken with the 0.8-m Katzman Automatic
Imaging Telescope on February 28.2 and March 1.2 UT (Puckett

et al. 2002). This supernova was a first representative of rapidly
evolving events (Fig. 10). Its light curve has a rise time of <7 days
followed by a decline of 0.25 mag day−1 in B band and reaches
a peak intrinsic brightness greater than −18 mag (Poznanski et al.
2010). The spectra are similar to that of a SN Ia but show the presence of helium and carbon lines. The analysis of archive data after
the discovery of this object and the subsequent observations revealed
other bright, fast-evolving supernovae, e.g., SN1885A, SN1939B,
SN2010X, SN2015U (Kasliwal et al. 2010; Perets et al. 2011; Shivvers et al. 2016). These objects can be produced by the detonation
of a helium shell on a white dwarf, ejecting a small envelope of
material (Poznanski et al. 2010).

5.1.2

SN2013cv

SN2013cv was independently discovered by Zhou et al. (2013)
and iPTF (Law et al. 2009) on 2013 May 1.44 UT, see Fig. 11.
This peculiar supernova has large peak optical and UV luminosity
and show an absence of iron absorption lines in the early spectra.
Cao et al. (2016b) suggests that SN2013cv is an intermediate case
between the normal and super-Chandrasekhar events.

5.1.3

SN2016bln

SN2016bln/iPTF16abc discovered by the iPTF on 2016 April l3.36
UT (Miller et al. 2016; Cenko et al. 2016) and classified by our
code as outlier, belongs to the 91T-like SNe Ia subtype (see Fig. 12).
The transitional and nebular spectrum of SN2016bln appear similar
to the normal SN2011fe as well as to over-luminous SNe 1991T
and 1999aa (Dhawan et al. 2018). Early-time observations show a
peculiar rise time, non-evolving blue colour, and unusual strong C II
absorption. These features can be explained by the ejecta interaction
with nearby, unbound material or/and significant 56 Ni mixing within
the SN ejecta (Miller et al. 2018).

5.2

Peculiar SNe II

Type II supernovae arise from the core collapse of massive stars
at the final stage of their evolution. The radius of these stars can
be several hundred times greater than the solar radius, and their
extremely tenuous envelopes contain large amounts of hydrogen.
That is why hydrogen lines are the most prominent in the spectra of
SNe II. Based on the shape of light curves Type II supernovae have
historically been divided into the Type IIL (linear) and Type IIP
(plateau) subtypes, however the following studies revealed a continuity in light curve slopes of Type II SNe (Anderson et al. 2014;
Sanders et al. 2015a).

5.2.1

SN2013ej

Light curve of SN2013ej, discovered by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search on 2013 July 25.45 UT (Kim et al. 2013), appears intermediate between those of Type IIP and IIL supernovae
(see Fig. 13). The event has a higher peak luminosity, a faster postpeak decline, and a shorter plateau phase compared to the normal
Type IIP SN 1999em. The radioactive 56 Ni mass is 0.02 M , which
is significantly lower than for typical SNe IIP (Huang et al. 2015).
The source exhibits signs of substantial geometric asphericity, Xrays from persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM),
thermal emission from warm dust (Mauerhan et al. 2017).

5.2.2

SN2016ija

This supernova was discovered on 2016 November 21.19 UT
(Tartaglia et al. 2016, see Fig. 14) during one-day cadence SN
search for very young transients in the nearby Universe (DLT40).
Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007), it was first suggested to be
an early time 91T-like SN Ia with few features and red continuum. It has been also associated to the outburst in an obscured
luminous blue variable, an intermediate luminosity red transient
or a luminous red nova (Blagorodnova et al. 2016). The subsequent spectroscopic follow-up revealed broad Hα and calcium features, leading to a classification as a highly extinguished Type II
supernova. The colour excess from the host galaxy NGC 1532 is
E(B − V)host = 1.95 ± 0.15 mag (Tartaglia et al. 2018). Moreover,
SN2016ija is brighter than usual SNe II (see fig. 6 of Tartaglia et al.
2018).
5.3

Superluminous SNe

Superluminous SNe are supernovae with an absolute peak magnitude M < −21 mag in any band. According to Gal-Yam (2012)
SLSN can be divided into three broad classes: SLSN-I without
hydrogen in their spectra, hydrogen-rich SLSN-II that often show
signs of interaction with CSM, and finally, SLSN-R, a rare class of
hydrogen-poor events with slowly evolving LCs, powered by the radioactive decay of 56 Ni. SLSN-R are suspected to be pair-instability
supernovae: the deaths of stars with initial masses between 140 and
260 solar masses.
In our outlier list in Table A1 there are four SLSN: SDSSII SN 17789, SN2015bn, PTF10aagc, SN2213-1745.
5.3.1

SN2213-1745

SN2213-1745 was discovered at z = 2.046 by the Canada-FranceHawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (Fig. 15). It belongs to the SLSN-R
events. Cooke et al. (2012) suggested that SN 2213-1745 may be
powered by the radiative decay of a 4–7 M of synthesised 56 Ni,
and implied a progenitor with an estimated initial mass of ∼250 M .
5.3.2

PTF10aagc

The high peak luminosity (Lbol,peak = 1043.7 erg s−1 ) and the
absence of hydrogen lines in early spectrum allowed to attribute
PTF10aagc to SLSN-I (De Cia et al. 2018, see Fig. 16). However, the
latter spectra revealed a broad Hα and the corresponding weak, but
detected Hβ (Yan et al. 2015). This particularity makes PTF10aagc
clearly distinct from others SLSN-I. Such spectral behaviour can
be explained by interaction between SLSN-I ejecta and a H-rich
circumstellar material at late times (Yan et al. 2015). The host
of PTF10aagc is bright and shows clear morphological structure
suggesting a possible ongoing merger (Perley et al. 2016).

SN2006kg

SN2006kg was first classified as a possible Type II SN (Bassett
et al. 2006, see Fig. 17). It is also appeared as Type II spectroscopically confirmed supernova in table 6 of Sako et al. (2008). However,
further analysis of 3.6-m New Technology Telescope spectrum revealed that SN2006kg is an active galactic nucleus (Östman et al.
2011; Sako et al. 2018). It is interesting that SN2006kg continues to

even in a set of 12 well-observed events that were used as Type II

the WISE AGN Catalog (Assef et al. 2018) that consists of >20
millions AGN candidates.

5.4.2

Gaia16aye

Gaia16aye (Bakis et al. 2016) is an object with the most non-SNlike behavior among our set of outliers (Fig. 18). In Wyrzykowski
et al. (2016) it was reported that Gaia16aye is a binary microlensing
event — gravitational microlensing of binary systems — the first
ever discovered towards the Galactic Plane.

5.4.3

Possible misclassified objects

Our analysis also reveals that 16 objects classified as pSN by Sako
et al. 2018, where a prefix "p" indicates a purely photometric type,
are likely to be stars or quasars. First, we do not find any signature of supernovae on the corresponding multicolour light curves.
Then, according to SDSS DR1512 type of SDSS-II SN 5314, SDSSII SN 14170, SDSS-II SN 15565, SDSS-II SN 13725, SDSSII SN 13741, SDSS-II SN 19699, SDSS-II SN 18266, SDSSII SN 4226, SDSS-II SN 2809, SDSS-II SN 6992 is denoted as
STAR. Moreover, all these objects can be found in Pan-STARRS
Catalog with Pan-STARRS magnitudes equal or even brighter than
those on the corresponding light curves.
The other objects SDSS-II SN 1706, SDSS-II SN 17756,
SDSS-II SN 17339, SDSS-II SN 17509, SDSS-II SN 4652, SDSSII SN 19395 have a BOSS (Smee et al. 2013) spectrum with class
"QSO" and have high redshifts (see Table A1)

CONCLUSIONS

The development of large sky surveys has led to a discovery of a
huge number of supernovae and supernova candidates. Among the

12

http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr15/en/tools/explore/summary.aspx

MNRAS 000, 1–18 (2019)

SNe discovered every year, only 10% have spectroscopic confirmation. The amount of astronomical data increases dramatically with
time and is already beyond human capabilities. The astronomical
community already has dozens of thousands of SN candidates, and
LSST survey (LSST Science Collaboration et al. 2009) will discover over ten million supernovae in the forthcoming decade. Only
a small fraction of them will receive a spectroscopic confirmation.
This motivates a considerable effort in photometric classification of
supernovae by types using machine learning algorithms. There is,
however, another aspect of the problem: any large photometric SN
database would suffer from the non-SN contamination (novae, kilonovae, GRB afterglows, AGNs, etc.). Moreover, the database will
inevitably contain the astronomical objects with unusual physical
properties — anomalies. Finding such objects and studying them in
detail is very important and constitutes the main goal of this paper.
The analysis presented here is based on the photometric data
extracted from the Open Supernova Catalog (Guillochon et al.
2017). The use of real data allows us to reveal a lot of caveats
in observations at the pre-pocessing stage – many of which are not
normally present in the simulated data. After pre-processing, we
obtain 1999 SNe with light curves either in gri or in g 0r 0i 0 or in
BRI filters approximated by Gaussian processes. We consider 10
different data sets: one that includes the approximated photometric
observations (A), another with the parameters of Gaussian process
only (B) and 8 data sets were the information in GP photometry
and GP parameters were summarised via dimensionality reduction
using t-SNE (dimension varying from 2 to 9, case C).
We apply the isolation forest algorithm to all data sets, considering a 1% contamination for cases A/B and 2% contamination
for all data sets in case C. We visually checked all objects identified in cases A and B. We also checked all the objects which were
identified as anomalous in at least 2 of the data sets in case C. As
a result, we find ∼100 outliers, 40 from cases A/B and 60 which
were identified in at least two data sets of case C. Among these,
19 objects were identified by both strategies, with and without dimensionality reduction. Our final validation analysis resulting in
81 objects which were carefully studied with the use of publicly
available information. Among these there are four superluminous
supernovae (SDSS-II SN 17789, SN2015bn, PTF10aagc, SN22131745), non-classical Type Ia SNe (91T-like SNe 2016bln, PS15cfn,
SNLS-03D1cm; peculiar SN2002bj and SN2013cv), two unusual

Figure 18. Light curves in gri filters of binary microlensing event Gaia16aye (http://gsaweb.ast.cam.ac.uk/alerts/alert/Gaia16aye/followup). Solid lines are the
results of our approximation by Multivariate Gaussian Process. The vertical line denotes the moment of maximum in r filter.

Type II SNe which anomalous multicolour light curve behaviour
can be due to the environment (SN2013ej, SN2016ija), one AGN
– SN2006kg, and one binary microlensing event Gaia16aye. We
also find that 16 anomalies classified as supernovae by Sako et al.
(2018), which are likely to be stars (SDSS-II SN 5314, SDSSII SN 14170, SDSS-II SN 15565, SDSS-II SN 13725, SDSSII SN 13741, SDSS-II SN 19699, SDSS-II SN 18266, SDSSII SN 4226, SDSS-II SN 2809, SDSS-II SN 6992) or quasars
(SDSS-II SN 1706, SDSS-II SN 17756, SDSS-II SN 17339, SDSSII SN 17509, SDSS-II SN 4652, SDSS-II SN 19395). However,
without careful spectral analysis it is difficult to distinguish a highredshift supernova against a background galaxy or from quasar
activity. As a confirmation of the robustness of the pipeline used
here, we note that of the 9 objects identified as outliers in all data
sets of case C, 5 are miss-classifications and 1 is an extreme case of
bad photometry.
In summary, the isolation forest analysis identified 81 potentially interesting objects, from which 27 (33%) where confirmed to
be non-SN events or representatives of the rare SN classes. Found
anomalies correspond to 1.4% of the original data set of ∼2000

objects which was identified demanding significantly less resources
than a manual search would entail. Among these objects, we report
for the first time the 16 star/quasar-like objects misclassified as SNe.
It is important to note that this results are not expected to be
complete. For example, there are known SLSN which were not identified as outliers in our search, as well as 1 object (SN1000+0216) at
very high redshift which was identified as anomalous in only 1 of the
data sets for case C — and consequently was not included in our final
list. This is a natural consequence of the pre-processing analysis we
chose to adopt, where the objects are mainly characterised by their
light curve shape (all photometric features were normalised). In this
context, differences in intrinsic brightness only marginally affect our
final results. Another source of false negatives can be traced back
to GP approximations, the typical example being Gaia16aye (Fig.
18). From a visual inspection of its observed photometric points
this objects is obviously not a SN. However, it appeared only in 3 of
the 8 possible data sets in case C. A more detailed analysis of its GP
approximation (solid line in Fig. 18), reveals that the information
input to the ML model was much smoother than one would expect.

SNAD: SuperNova Anomaly Detection
As a consequence, the algorithm struggles to separate it from other
slow declining events.
Nevertheless, the above results provide clear evidence of the
effectiveness of automated anomaly detection algorithms for photometric SN light curve analysis. In this work we used data from
the OSC in order to provide a proof of concept. Although this is
not a big data sample, it does allow us to search for independent
information in the literature on which we could confirm our findings. This approach to the analysis of photometric light curves will
be paramount for future astronomical surveys like LSST, which will
not be able to afford a manual research or the possibility to overlook
interesting objects deviating from the bulk of the data — where the
most interesting physics resides.

a normal Type IIP event, although with a steeper decline
during the plateau relative to other archetypal SNe of similar
brightness

LC is intermediate between those of Type IIP and IIL SNe

SLSN-I with hydrogen in late spectra; host morphological
structure suggests a possible ongoing merger

This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX file prepared by the author.

† The object is also found in a data set of 364 photometric characteristics (121 × 3 normalized fluxes and the LC flux maximum).

? The object is also found in a data set of 10 Gaussian process parameters (9 fitted parameters of the kernel and the log-likelihood of the fit).

d If classification is made by Sako et al. 2018: a prefix "p" (pSN) indicates a purely photometric type, a prefix "z" (zSN) indicates that a redshift is measured from its candidate host galaxy and the classification uses that redshift as a prior.

c Separation of the source from the center of its host galaxy.

b Simbad host galaxy morphological type.
