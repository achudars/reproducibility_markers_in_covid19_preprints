It is now well established that the Kitaev honeycomb model in a magnetic field along the [111]direction harbors an intermediate gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase sandwiched between a
gapped non-abelian QSL at low fields H < Hc1 and a partially polarized phase at high fields H >
Hc2 . Here, we analyze the low field and high field phases and phase transitions in terms of singleand two-magnon excitations using exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) methods. We find that the energy to create a bound state of two-magnons ∆p
becomes lower than the energy to create a single spin flip ∆s near Hc2 . In the entire Kitaev spin
liquid ∆p < ∆s and both gaps vanish at Hc2 . We make testable predictions for magnon pairing
that could be observable in Raman scattering measurements on Kitaev QSL candidate materials.

Introduction: Quantum spin liquids (QSL) have generated significant excitement because of their potential
applications for topological quantum computation. In
QSLs, magnetic order is suppressed by quantum fluctuations hence they cannot be described within the traditional Landau theory of symmetry-breaking which is
based on the existence of a local order parameter. Instead, the concept of topology plays a central role in the
study of QSLs. QSLs are characterized by long-range
entanglement, multiple degeneracy of the ground-state,
fractionalized quasi-particles and the existence of topological order [1–6].
The Kitaev spin-1/2 model on the honeycomb lattice [7] is the paradigmatic example for a QSL because
of its unique combination of exact solvability hosting a
variety of gapped and gapless QSL phases [8–13] and for
having experimental relevance [14–22]. It is described by

where we take the interaction parameter K to be antiferromagnetic (K γ > 0). The pairwise nearest neighbor
Ising spin interactions are bond (γ = x, y, z)-dependent
between sites i and j (Fig. 1a). The isotropic AFM Kitaev model (K x = K y = K z = 1eV) has a topologically non-trivial gapless QSL ground-state. Following
Kitaev’s original solution, each spin-1/2 can be split into
four Majorana fermions: three are associated with the
bonds and one with the original site. The bond Majoranas can be recombined to form a static Z2 gauge field,
leaving a single free Majorana fermion moving in a background of Z2 -gauge fields. The Majorana spectrum is
gapless with Dirac points located at the K/K 0 points
of the Brillouin zone, yielding a gapless Z2 Kitaev spin
liquid (KSL) [7, 8].
In this Letter our main goal is to obtain the effect of
a magnetic field on the magnetic excitation spectrum.
As shown schematically in Fig. 1b, we have previously
discovered two transitions between a gapped KSL and a
gapless U (1) QSL at Hc1 and a second phase transition
between the gapless U (1) QSL and a partially polarized
magnetic phase at Hc2 [9, 10]. We choose to use the hard

core boson (HCB) representation [23] to describe the S =
1/2 operators in order to describe the gap closing at the
critical fields in the familiar language of multi-magnon
excitations. Our main contribution is the calculation of
the dynamical one- and two-particle spectra as a function
of magnetic field from which we extract the gap scales as
shown schematically in Fig. 1b.
Kitaev model in a magnetic field along [111]: The
isotropic AFM Kitaev model with an external magnetic
field applied
in the [111]-direction is defined by adding
P
−H · iγ Si γ to the Kitaev Hamiltonian in Eq. 1,
where H = H(êx + êy + êz ) is perpendicular to the 2D
honeycomb plane with equal projections along the bond
directions {êx , êy , êz }. We use density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [24–31] to directly simulate
the interacting spin model and exact diagonalization
(ED) to evaluate the spectrum of the HCB model. The
dynamical spectra are obtained using Lanczos on small
clusters [27, 32]. Overall, the combination of the spin
and hard-core boson representations provides useful
insights.
One- and Two-spin Dynamical Spectra: We calculate the
one-particle (magnon) and two-particle (two-magnon)
dynamical spectra as a function of the magnetic field
H. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy gives
information about the magnon dispersion. Here we
make predictions for two-magnon spectroscopy that can
be probed by Raman spectroscopy to see the effects of
magnon-magnon bound states [33]. To this end, we calculate the magnon density of states S(ω) and the magnon
pair density of states P (ω) defined by

Schematic phase diagram based on references [9, 15] that show the evolution of the gapless Z2 Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) to a
Z2 gapped KSL (I) as a function of a magnetic field along [111] or e3 perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The one-particle
gap ∆s is the energy cost for creating a spin-flip or a magnon excitation with a change in the spin quantum number ∆S = 1 .
The two-particle gap ∆p , main result of our paper, is the energy cost of creating two spin-flips or a two-magnon bound-state.
A phase transition is signaled by closing of ∆s and ∆p gaps with increasing field, leading to an intermediate U (1) gapless QSL
(II). For H > Hc2 , the gaps ∆s and ∆p become finite again in the partially polarized magnetic (PPM) phase (III) and increase
linearly at high fields H  Hc2 . In the region H < Hc1 , ∆p is always smaller than ∆s . In the PPM phase, there is a cross
over between the energy scales ∆s and ∆p that occurs near Hc2 . The schematic plots for ∆s and ∆p are based on calculations
presented in fig. 2c. The analysis of the lowest energy gap ∆E, magnetization M and the peaks in magnetic susceptibility χ
as a function of H give Hc1 = 0.21 and Hc2 = 0.34 in Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material.

state), γ = {x, y, z} is the bond direction with respect to
site i, ω is the energy transferred to the system. We
use fixed ∆ω = 0.01 with η = 0.02 as an artificial
broadening parameter for all presented calculations. We
consider all possible spin-flip processes built in through
α = {+, −, z}. The one-magnon creation operator Si+
scatters a boson from an initial state |0i and to a final
state |mi. The Raman scattering involves the creation
or destruction of a pair of magnons denoted by a pair of
α
spin operators Siα Si+γ
along different bonds γ.
Fig. 2 shows density of states (DOS) plots of oneparticle DOS S(ω), two-particle DOS P (ω) and the corresponding gaps ∆s/p for all H. We also show S(ω) and
P (ω) for a few H within each phase of the phase diagram in Fig. 3. We also compare one-particle spectra obtained by exact methods with the corresponding spectra
and gap ∆LSW T obtained from linear spin-wave theory
(LSWT) [23].
H < Hc1 : For H = 0 in the gapless Z2 KSL, the two
particle gap is less than the energy to create a single spin
flip (SF), ∆p < ∆s , (Figs. 2c and 3a). With increasing
H, the system enters the Z2 gapped KSL phase in which
∆p continues to remain below ∆s and both gaps vanish
at Hc1 (see Figs. 3b and 2c).
Hc1 ≤ H ≤ Hc2 : A broad high energy continuum in the
one and two-particle excitation is found for the intermediate gapless QSL (Figs. 2a-b and 3c-d), that extends
upto ω ' 0.15 for S(ω) and ω ' 0.2 for P (ω). We attribute this characteristic high energy continuum to the
formation of a Fermi surface of fractionalized charge neutral spin-1/2 spinons that are coupled to U(1) gauge field
fluctuations [9]. We show here that in addition to gapless spin-flip excitations, two spin-flip excitations are also
gapless, ∆p = 0.

H > Hc2 : The continuum splits into multiple independent modes that shift to higher energies with increasing H (Figs. 2 and 3e-i). For sufficiently large magnetic field (H > Hc2 ), the ground state gets polarized
along the direction of H, leading to partially polarized
magnetic (PPM) phase that is precursor to a trivially
polarized product state. This transition is signaled by
opening of a spin-gap ∆s that increases linearly with
field at large H. At high fields the two-magnon gap
∆p = 2∆s , as expected, however, close to the transition,
we find a crossover between gaps with ∆p dipping below
∆s (see Fig. 2c and 3e-f). Further away from the transition, Fig. 3g-i shows that the two-particle spectral weight
shifts to higher energies compared to the one-particle indicating a crossover of the gap scales.
Fig. 2c shows one particle ∆s and two-particle ∆p gaps
as a function of H, extracted from the exact calculations.
Fig. 2c shows remarkable agreement between ∆LSW T and
∆s for sufficiently large fields. Additionally, we demonstrate that there is a crossover in ∆s and ∆p at H ' 0.5
where ∆p < ∆s . This is one of the key results of our
work. We demonstrate that two-particle excitations play
a main role near the Hc2 phase transition. In fact, Figures 3a-b show that low energy physics is dominated by
(both) one and two magnon excitations. For lower fields,
Hc2 < H < 0.4, the LSWT results significantly deviate
from the exact one-particle results, indicating the importance of inter-particle interactions in the intermediate
phase, in agreement with Ref. [34]. This kind of picture
is readily available in some extended Kitaev-like material
α − RuCl3 ; here also authors claim multi-magnon processes are important in the high-field (field applied along
a and b-axis of the material) [35, 36].

FIG. 3.
The normalized one-magnon S(ω) and two-magnon P γ (ω) dynamical spectra are shown for certain cuts in the
contour plot of the intensity. Left panel (a)-(c) shows one and two-particle excitations from zero-field Kitaev limit towards
gapless phase. The middle panel (d)-(f) Hc2 to partially polarized phase and the right panel (g)-(i) gives the magnon intensity
for the high-field polarized phase. DOS calculated from LSWT is shown for high-field phases where the agreement is good.

Magnon pair and density order parameters: In order to
understand the processes that close the gap at the critical fields, we analyze the order parameter for forming
a bound state of magnons or correspondingly, the boson
P
bound-state order parameter ∆γ = (1/N ) i ha†i a†i+δγ i
γ
and the
P boson density-density bond correlator N =
(1/N ) i hni ni+δγ i.
Fig. 4a shows that the pair order parameter is finite
for the x, y-bonds since pairing operators appear explicitly in the Hamiltonian on the x−, y− bonds since
hSi+ Sj+ i ∝ ha†i a†j i. On the other hand, two-boson pairing
develops on the z-bond near the critical field Hc1 with
a maximum value for H ' 0.45. The two-boson bound
state is unfavourable in the polarized limit (H → ∞)
as all correlations are suppressed in the product-state.
Remarkably, two-particle pairing on all bonds is most

favorable close to the phase boundary H = Hc2 of the
gapless QSL and PPM phase. Fig. 4d is the real space
representation of Fig. 4a, where the thickness of the lines
represents the magnitude and the color represents the
phase θ. For H = 0, ∆x/y 6= 0 forms a zig-zag chain
pattern with θ = 0 phase. With increasing field, pairing
develops on the z-bonds with θ > 0 while the x− and y−
bonds have the opposite phase structure for the pairing
field.
At H = 0, we find N z 6= 0 while N x = N y = 0
(fig. 4b). At the high field limit, N γ approaches zero.
With increasing field, N z approaches zero monotonically
while N x/y show non-monotonic behavior with H, with
large density fluctuations near the critical field Hc2 .
We perform similar analysis of the pairing and boson
density correlations using the ‘rotated’ ({ê1 , ê2 , ê3 }) basis

Real space representation of pairing on different bonds on the honeycomb lattice for unrotated (panel d) and rotated (panel e)
coordinates. Thickness of the line gives the magnitude ∆0 of the pairing and the phase θ is indicated by the color gradient.

(Fig. 4c). In the rotated basis ∆γ and N γ on all bonds
are equivalent as expected. There is sudden decrease in
∆γ and N γ at Hc1 followed by a sharp increase at Hc2 .
The pair magnitude is largest beyond Hc2 followed by a
continuous decrease into the partially polarized product
state where all correlations are suppressed. The density
correlations are real with no associated complex phases
and are qualitatively similar to the local boson pair correlations. However, there is an overall change in the sign
associated with the hni nj i in the gapless phase. Fig. 4e
shows the real-space representation of the boson pairing on different bonds for fixed values of H analogous to
fig. 4d for the unrotated case. For the rotated case, the
phase on x, y-bonds remains equal and opposite and zero
phase for the z-bond. Therefore, with increasing field
only the amplitude of boson-pairing evolves and there is
no change in the phase.
Is boson pair formation tied to the two spin-flip (SF) processes in the ground-state? We calculate the probability
associated with different SF processes in the ground-state
and the first excited state (Fig. S2 [23]). We discover
that 2 and 4 SF processes are more likely and mix into
the ground-state rather than 1-SF. Further, the 1st excited state in the PPM phase contains a high probability

of even number of spin-flips for H > 0.5. This clearly indicates that 2-magnon excitations or pair-like excitations
are key players in the phase transition near Hc2 into the
gapless QSL phase.
Experimental Implications: We predict that the lowenergy Raman response for one-particle and two-particle
excitations should show distinctive signatures in the different regimes of the phase diagram. One of our significant findings is that gap with decreasing magnetic field
from the polarized regime closes by a pair-magnon process rather than by one magnon process. This result
is confirmed from our calculations of the boson bound
state on each bond, the spin-flip probability amplitude
and one- and two- spin flip spectra. It would first be
useful to establish that at fields much larger than Hc2 ,
the two-spin gap is approximately twice the single-spin
gap. Once this is established, it would be interesting to
see if the gap scale for two-spin excitations dips below
the one-spin excitation close to Hc2 .

operators on a site i. The one-spin- flip operator Si+ is
equivalent to creating a boson, and the exclusion principle leads to a constraint ni = 0 or 1, hence a hardcore boson constraint. In the HCB transformed basis,
the up spin is identified as singly occupied boson and a
down spin is identified as an empty site. This analogy
between the spin variables and the HCB variables was
first explored in the context of helium [37] and later in
the context of the Heisenberg model [38].
The above Hamiltonian (S1) can be expressed in terms
of HCB in the {eˆx , eˆy , eˆz } (‘unrotated’) bond-directional

direction of the magnetic field: √13 (êx + êy + êz ). In
the ‘rotated’ basis, the up spin configuration refers to
spin aligned along the [111]-direction of the original
{êx , êy , êz } basis. This coordinate rotation allows us to
analyze the spin-flip processes in the ground-state.

S.2 Benchmarking Results with HCB Representation —
We analyze the rotated HCB Kitaev model (S6) using ED and Lanczos [32], while we directly simulate the

Kitaev model in the un-rotated spin representation (S1)
using DMRG. We use N = 8, 12, 16, 18 and 96 sites honeycomb geometry on a torus for ED/Lanczos and a cylinder for DMRG. We begin by analyzing the ground-state
energy, magnetization M , and spin susceptibility χ defined as,

(S7)

∂M
∂H

to benchmark our results with previous findings [9–11, 15,
39]. Note that M is defined in the original {êx , êy , êz }
bond basis and can also be obtained in the {ê1 , ê2 , ê3 }
basis using Equation S5.
The energy gap (∆E = E1 − E0 ) as a function of the
magnetic field is presented in Fig. S1a. With decreasing
field, the energy gap closes at a critical field strength
Hc2 and the spectrum remains gapless upto Hc1 . For
H ≤ Hc1 , a gap reopens and vanishes again at H = 0.
The magnetization in the presence of [111]-field would
tend to align the spins along the ê3 in the rotated basis,
therefore we find that S 3 = 0.5 and S 1 = S 2 = 0 for
large fields. The two-step structure of M in Fig. S1b and
the corresponding two-peak structure of χ in Fig. S1c
indicate two-phase transitions, in agreement with our
previous works [9–11]. A finite-size scaling analysis in
Fig. S1d using a combined ED, Lanczos and DMRG data
yields extrapolated values of Hc1 = 0.208 ± 0.03 and
Hc2 = 0.340 ± 0.01.
S.3 Spin-flip Probabilities —
We address the following questions:
(1) What are the dominant processes involved in closing
the spin gap with decreasing H?
(2) Is boson bound-state formation tied to the two spinflip processes in the ground-state?
To this end, we show probability associated with ‘n’
spin-flips in the ground-state |Ψ0 i and the first excited
state |Ψ1 i (Fig. S2). We define this probability as
X
an =
|cb |2
(S8)
b∈n
z
where N is the number of sites, n = N −hb|Stotal
|bi is the
number of spin flips relative to the fully polarized phase,
and b labels a particular configuration of the N spins with
the constraint that the configuration has n spin flips. For
example, the ground-state is |↑↑↑ .... ↑i in a polarized
phase at H → ∞. With zero spin-flip processes, this
is the only candidate because only configuration |bi =
|↑↑↑ .... ↑i contributes to the ground-state. This in turn
implies that the probability associated with n 6= 0 spinflips are zero (an6=0 = 0) as shown in Fig. S2a.

data are obtained from DMRG [9]. The extrapolated values of
Hc1 and Hc2 are 0.208 (±0.03) and 0.340 (±0.01) respectively
in the N → ∞ limit.

High-field phase: The first excited state in the PPM
phase corresponds to creating a magnon or a single spinflip. Fig. S2b shows that indeed the 1st excited state for
H > 0.5 has a large probability associated with a1 , i.e., a
single spin-down in a sea of spin-up (1 spin-flip). Naively,
one would expect that upon decreasing H towards Hc2 ,

FIG. S2. Dominant spin-flip processes that contribute to the closing of the magnon gap from the ground state and the first
excited state wave functions respectively. (a) and (b) show the results from the high-field end; (c) and (d) show the results
from the low-field Kitaev spin liquid end.

the ground-state probability of 1 spin-flip process would
dominate. Remarkably, we discover that two and four
spin-flip (a2 and a4 ) processes become more likely in the
ground-state rather than a1 (Fig. S2a). This clearly indicates that two-magnon excitations or pair-like excitations
are the key players in the phase transition near Hc2 . Similar analysis of the |Ψ1 i shows that the a3 process dominates near Hc2 , i.e., 2-flips with respect to the high-field
|Ψ1 i = | ↑↓↑ ... ↑i. This analysis shows the dominance of
even spin-flips, with respect to the high field state, as the
phase transition to the gapless QSL phase is approached.
Low-field phases: The zero field KSL phase preserves
time-reversal symmetry and hence we expect an equal
number of spin-up and spin-down configurations mixing
in the ground-state. This is in agreement with the
large probability associated with a9 , i.e., N/2 = 9

for the N = 18 spins considered here in the up-state
along the e3 direction as shown in Fig. S2c. The linear
superposition of configurations with equal number of up
and down spins is also consistent with a spin-disordered
QSL ground state and also for the excited state |Ψ1 i
(Fig. S2d). Upon increasing H, the system develops a
finite magnetization as spin-up configurations become
more favorable relative to spin-down. Therefore, we find
an overall shift in the peaks of an with increasing H,
i.e., the higher order spin-flip processes are less likely
with increasing H (Fig. S2c and Fig. S2d).

S.4 Linear Spin-Wave Theory — The high-field
polarized phase hosts “magnons” as topological excitations [40, 41]. Spin waves in magnetically ordered sys-

4
tems are analog of lattice waves in solid systems, where
a quantized spin wave is called a “magnon”. These are
best studied within the spin-wave theory by representing
the spin operators in terms of auxiliary bosons via the
Holstein-Primakoff transformation. We expand about
this fully polarized state using the following transformation and commutation relations:
