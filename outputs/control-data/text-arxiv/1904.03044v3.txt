Abstract. This paper presents a derivation of the possible residual symmetries of rational
K-matrices which are invertible in the ”classical limit” (the spectral parameter goes to
infinity). This derivation uses only the boundary Yang-Baxter equation and the asymptotic
expansions of the R-matrices. The result proves the previous assumption of the literature: if
the original and the residual symmetry algebras are g and h then there exists a Lie-algebra
involution of g for which the invariant sub-algebra is h. In addition, we study some Kmatrices which are not invertible in the ”classical limit”. It is shown that their symmetry
algebra is not reductive but a semi-direct sum of reductive and solvable Lie-algebras.

Keywords: rational K-matrix, boundary Yang-Baxter equation, classification
1. Introduction
Integrable physical systems with boundaries can be defined by their R- and K-matrices
[Skl88]. The R-matrices satisfy the famous Yang-Baxter equation and the K-matrix is the
solution of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation (bYBE) for a given R-matrix. In this paper
we give a derivation of the possible residual symmetries of the rational K-matrices. Some
explicit forms of rational K-matrices (where there is no boundary degrees of freedom) were
calculated for the defining representations of the matrix Lie-algebras [MS03]. Motivated by
a classical argument, the derivation uses the following assumption. If the boundary breaks
the bulk symmetry G to H then G/H has to be a symmetric space, which means that there
exists a Lie-group involution for which the subgroup H is invariant. There are other direct
calculations of K-matrices in the defining representation in [AAC+ 03, AAC+ 04].
It is well known that a special class of the ratioanal R-matrices are classified with the
representations of Yangian algebras [Dri85, Loe16]. The introduction of boundaries into the
theory of Yangians leads to a whole new class of the so-called reflection or twisted Yangian
algebras [Ols92, MR02, GR16]. The twisted Yangians are in exact correspondence with the
symmetric spaces G/H which are given by a proper involution. The involution can be used to
construct a co-ideal sub-algebra (which is isomorphic to the twisted Yangian) of the original

Yangian. The representations of this co-ideal sub-algebra can be further used to calculate
K-matrices [DMS01, Mac02].
In this paper we derive the assumption above - i.e. we prove for K-matrices (which are
invertible in the ”classical limit”) that the residual symmetry algebra has to be the invariant
sub-algebra of a Lie algebra involution. This derivation use only the boundary Yang-Baxter
equation and the asymptotic expansion of the R- and K-matrices. We give an example for
a K-matrix with non-invertible ”classical limit” and we describe its symmetry which is not a
reductive Lie-algebra but a semi-direct sum of a solvable and a reductive algebra.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the basic notations. Section
3 contains the main theorem and proofs which lead to the classification of possible K-matrices
with invertible ”classical limit” when the boundary vector space is one dimensional. In this
section, we also give an example for K-matrices with non-invertible ”classical limit” and
describe its symmetry. In section 4, we extend the main theorem of section 3 to K-matrices
with general finite dimensional boundary vector spaces.
2. Notations
Let g be a complex simple Lie algebra with basis {XA } where A = 1, . . . , dim(g) and
C
XC . If ρ(i) : g → End(Cdi ) is a faithful representation of g then let
[XA , XB ] = fAB
V (i) := ρ(i) (g) ⊂ End(Cdi ). There is a non-degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form
(metric) h·, ·ii : End(Cdi ) ⊗ End(Cdi ) → C for which hY, Zii = Tr (Y Z). This metric can be
used to define the orthogonal complement of V (i) in End(Cdi ): End(Cdi ) = V (i) ⊕ V̄ (i) for
which Y, Ȳ i = 0 for all Y ∈ V (i) and Ȳ ∈ V̄ (i) . We can choose a basis in V (i) and V̄ (i) .

Let h be a subalgebra of g then (g,h) is a symmetric pair if there exists a Lie-algebra
involution α for which α(X) = X for all X ∈ h. If f is the orthogonal complement of h in g
then g = h ⊕ f is a Z2 graded decomposition i.e.
[h, h] ⊆ h

[h, f] ⊆ f

[f, f] ⊆ h

We can choose a basis in h and f: {Xa } and {Xα } respectively where a = 1, . . . , dim(h) and
α = dim(h) + 1, . . . , dim(g). Using this basis, one can define C (h,12) = B ab ρ(1) (Xa ) ⊗ ρ(2) (Xb )
and C (f,12) = B αβ ρ(1) (Xα )⊗ρ(2) (Xβ ) for which C (12) = C (h,12) +C (f,12) . The quadratic Casimir
of h is c(h,1) = B ab ρ(1) (Xa ) ρ(1) (Xb ).
Let ρ(B) : h → End(CdB ) be a representation of subalgebra h then C (h,1B) = B ab ρ(1) (Xa )⊗
ρ(B) (Xb ).
Let W (i) := ρ(i) (h) ⊂ End(Cdi ). Obviously W (i) ⊆ V (i) . The metric can be used to define

Definition 2. Let R(ij) (u) ∈ End Cdi ⊗ Cdj be a quasi classical R-matrix in the
representation ρ(i) ⊗ ρ(j) and h is a sub-algebra of g where i, j = 1, 2. The map K(u) :

Cd2 ⊗ CdB → Cd1 ⊗ CdB is a (g, h) symmetric K-matrix in the representation ρ(1) , ρ(2) if the
following two conditions are satisfied.

R12 (u − v)K13 (u)R21 (u + v)K23 (v) = K23 (v)R12 (u + v)K13 (u)R21 (u − v).

Definition 3. Let K(u) be a (g, h) symmetric K-matrix with the following asymptotic
expansion
(3)

K(u) = κ + O(u−1).
The K-matrix K(u) is called quasi-classical if κ is invertible.
In the following we deal with quasi-classical K-matrices therefore d1 = d2 = d.
3. K-matrices with 1 dimensional boundary space

In this section we investigate K-matrices with one dimensional boundary space i.e. dB = 1.

Proposition 4. If there exists a quasi classical K-matrix in the representation ρ(1) , ρ(2)
then the map Adκ : End(Cd ) → End(Cd ) is a bijection between ρ(1) (g) and ρ(2) (g) i.e.

Adκ (ρ(2) (XA )) = MAB ρ(1) (XB ) where M is invertible, and M2 = 1 ((M)B

From this, we can derive that Adκ is a bijection between ρ(1) (g) and ρ(2) (g). The action of
Adκ on ρ(2) (g) can be written as follows

From this, we obtain two constrains for M and N:

BMT B−1 N = 0.

It follows from the first that M is invertible and M−1 = BMT B−1 . Using this in the second
equation, we obtain that N = 0. Therefore
(2)

(1)

Adκ (YA ) = MAB YB

(9)

which implies that Adκ is a bijection between ρ(1) (g) and ρ(2) (g).

Corollary 5. If there exists a quasi classical K-matrix in the representation ρ(1) , ρ(2) then
there exists a Lie algebra involution α : g → g, α2 = idg for which Adκ (ρ(2) (X)) = ρ(1) (α(X)).
Proof. Since Adκ (ρ(2) (X)) ∈ ρ(1) (g) for all X ∈ g and ρ(1) is faithful, the map α =
−1
ρ(1)
◦ Adκ ◦ ρ(2) : g → g exists and it is a Lie algebra automorphism. From (9) we
obtain that α(XA ) = MAB XB . We also saw that M2 = 1, therefore α2 = idg i.e. α is a Lie
algebra involution.
−1

From the definition of α we obtain that α(X) = ρ(1)
Adκ ρ(2) (X) therefore
Adκ (ρ(2) (X)) = ρ(1) (α(X))

(10)

for all X ∈ g.
Remark 6. The equation (10) can be written as
ρ(2) = Adκ−1 ◦ ρ(1) ◦ α
Therefore if we choose an arbitrary representation ρ(1) and a Lie algebra involution α then
the equation above fixes ρ(2) . Let us choose ρ(1) = ρ then there are two possibilities for ρ(2) .

(i) There exists V ∈ Aut(Cd ) such that ρ ◦ α = AdV −1 ◦ ρ. This V exists for all inner and
some outer involutions. Using V , the equation (10) reads as
ρ(2) = Ad(V κ)−1 ◦ ρ
which means ρ and ρ(2) are equivalent representations, it is therefore advisable to choose
a basis where ρ(2) = ρ. In this basis
ρ(α(X)) = Adκ (ρ(X)) = κρ(X)κ−1 ,
Therefore these K-matrices belong to the usual untwisted boundary Yang-Baxter
equation:
R12 (u − v)K1 (u)R21 (u + v)K2 (v) = K2 (v)R12 (u + v)K1 (u)R21 (u − v),
where R(u) is the R-matrix in the ρ ⊗ ρ representation.
(ii) There is no V ∈ Aut(Cd ) such that ρ ◦ α = AdV −1 ◦ ρ which is true for some outer
involutions. These belong to the Z2 automorphisms of the Dynkin-diagrams of the Liealgebras, e.g. in the case of the An series, these connect the representations to their
contra-gradient representations, therefore ρ(2) = ρcg i.e.
ρ(α(X)) = Adκ (ρcg (X)) = −κρ(X)T κ−1 ,
for all X ∈ g. Therefore these K-matrices belong to the twisted boundary Yang-Baxter
equation:
R12 (u − v)K1 (u)R̄21 (u + v)K2 (v) = K2 (v)R̄12 (u + v)K1 (u)R21 (u − v),
where R̄(u) is the crossed R-matrix of R(u):
R̄(u) = R(Γ − u)T1 ,
where Γ is the crossing parameter.
Theorem 7. Let K(u) be a quasi classical (g, h) symmetric K-matrix in the representation

ρ(1) , ρ(2) then (g, h) is a symmetric pair.

Proof. From the previous corollary there exists a Lie algebra involution α, for which
Adκ (ρ(2) (X)) = ρ(1) (α(X)). This involution can be used for a Z2 graded decomposition:
g = h0 ⊕ f where α(X (+) ) = +X (+) and α(X (−) ) = −X (−) for all X (+) ∈ h0 and X (−) ∈ f.
Therefore (g, h0 ) is a symmetric pair.
Let us assume that X ∈ h. This implies that K(u)ρ(2) (X) = ρ(1) (X)K(u) (see
equation (2)) which reads as κρ(2) (X) = ρ(1) (X)κ in the asymtotic limit. Therefore
Adκ (ρ(2) (X)) = ρ(1) (X) which implies that α(X) = X i.e X ∈ h0 therefore h ⊆ h0 .
Now, we take the bYBE in the v → ∞ limit:

which implies that

Therefore

B AB K(u)ρ(2) (X) − ρ(1) (X)K(u) ⊗ ρ(1) (XB ) + κρ(2) (XB )κ−1 =

=0

B ab K(u)ρ(2) (Xa ) − ρ(1) (Xa )K(u) ⊗ ρ(1) (Xb ) = 0

which is equivalent to

K(u)ρ(2) (X) = ρ(1) (X)K(u)
for all X ∈ h0 which implies that h0 ⊆ h. We have seen previously that h ⊆ h0 therefore
h0 = h i.e. (g, h) is a symmetric pair.

Theorem 8. The (g, h) symmetric K-matrix in the representation ρ(1) , ρ(2) is unique up
to a multiplicative scalar function if h is semi-simple, ρ(1) is irreducible and the matrix κ is
fixed. If h is not semi-simple but reductive then the K-matrix may have a free parameter.
Remark 9. The proof of this theorem can be found in [BS19] for a special case when g = sl(n)
and ρ(1) and ρ(2) are the defining representations. The authors of that paper uses the Sklyanin
determinant but we do not use it in the following modified proof.
Proof. Let the asymptotic expansion of K(u) be
1
1
K(u) = κ + k (1) + . . . + r k (r) + . . .
u
u
where κ is a fixed. The bYBE is invariant under the scalar multiplication: K(u) → c(u)K(u).
We can fix this freedom by

Tr K(u)κ−1 = d.
(11)

Let us assume that we have two K-matrices satisfying the bYBE with the above
normalization, and these agree up to order r − 1. The difference of the two K-matrices
are
1
K̃(u) − K(u) = r δk (r) + . . .
u
From the normalization (11) we obtain that

Tr δk (r) κ−1 = 0.

therefore


ρ(1) (X), δk (1) κ−1 = 0

for all X ∈ h. Since δk (1) κ−1 ∈ ρ(1) (g), δk (1) = 0 if h is semi-simple. For reductive h, the
δk (1) κ−1 is an element of the center of h which is a one dimensional subspace for the (g, h)
symmetric pair (see the classification of symmetric pairs [Hel79]), therefore K(u) may has a
free parameter.
3.2. Comments on the classical limit
The reason we use the ”quasi classical” name is the following [Dri85]. The YBE does not fix
the norm of the R-matrix and the spectral parameter (if R(u) a solution then c(u)R(xu) is
also a solution for all x ∈ C and any complex function c(u)) therefore one can redefine the
spectral parameter as u → u/~ for which
R(ij) (u, ~) := R(ij) (u/~) = 1 + ~r (ij) (u) + O(~2 ).
where r(u) is the classical R-matrix

r12 (u), r13 (u + v) + r12 (u), r23 (v) + r13 (u + v), r23 (v) = 0

which is the order ~2 term of the YBE. Scaling the spectral parameter in the K-matrix
similarly, we obtain that
K(u, ~) := K(u/~) = κ + O(~).

The first non-trivial term of the bYBE in ~ reads as
r (11) (u − v)κ1 κ2 − κ1 κ2 r (22) (u − v) + κ1 r (21) (u + v)κ2 − κ2 r (12) (u + v)κ1 = 0
which is the classical boundary Yang-Baxter equation (cbYBE) which was investigated in
Proposition 4.
However, we saw that if the residual symmetry is not semi-simple then the K-matrix
may have a free parameter (K(u) → K(u, a) where a is the free parameter). These free
parameter dependent solutions really exist [Gom18b]. The asymptotic expansion of these
K-matrices can be written as

1 (1)
K(u, a) = κ +
k + aρ(1) (X0 ) κ + O(u−2 ),
(16)
u
where X0 is the central element of h and
ρ(1) (X0 ), k (1) = 0

ρ(1) (X0 ), ρ(1) (X0 ) = 1

On the classification of rational K-matrices

11

The above parameter can become an ~ dependent function: a → a(~). Using a proper
function a(~) the K-matrix can be written as
K(u, ~, a(~)) := K(u/~, a(~)) = κ̃(u) + O(~)

(17)

which means that the classical limit of the K-matrix can be spectral parameter dependent.
Using this ~ expansion, the first non-trivial term of the bYBE can be written as
(11)

(22)

r12 (u − v)κ̃1 (u)κ̃2 (v) − κ̃1 (u)κ̃2 (v)r12 (u − v) +
(21)

(12)

κ̃1 (u)r12 (u + v)κ̃2 (v) − κ̃2 (v)r12 (u + v)κ̃1 (u) = 0
which is the classical boundary Yang-Baxter equation for spectral parameter dependent κmatrix. In [Gom18a], there was derived some solutions of this equation in the defining
representations of the matrix Lie-algebras. These solutions can be matched to the parameter
dependent solutions of the bYBE.

Using the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 8, one can prove that k (r) = 0 which
implies that κ̃(u) = κ.
Proposition 11. If h is reductive Lie-algebra then the asymptotic expansion of κ̃(u) has to
be
a0
κ̃(u) = κ + ρ(X0 )κ + O(u−2 )
(22)
u
where X0 is a central element of h for which hρ(X0 ), ρ(X0 )i = 1 and a0 ∈ C. If we fix a0 then
κ̃(u) is unique.
Proof. Putting
1
κ̃(u) = κ + k (1) + O(u−(2) )
u
into equation (20) we obtain the equation (21) for r = 1. Using the same argument as the
proof of Theorem 8, one can prove that k (1) κ−1 has to be a central element of h which means
that k (1) = a0 ρ(X0 )κ.
The proof of the universality is the same as for K(u).
Corollary 12. Let κ̃(u, a0 ) be the κ-matrix with a fixed parameter a0 and κ̃(u) = κ̃(u, 1)
then κ̃(u, a0 ) = κ̃(u/a0 , 1) = κ̃(u/a0 ).
We can connect the parameter a0 of (22) to the function a(~). From equations (16),(17)
and (22) we can obtain that
1
a(~) = (a0 + O(~)) .
~
In summary, if the residual symmetry algebra is semi-simple then the classical κ-matrix
is fixed by the symmetry, and the quantum correction to K-matrix is fixed by this κ and the
bYBE (up to a normalization)
κ =⇒ K(u, ~).

On the classification of rational K-matrices

13

However, if the residual symmetry algebra is not semi-simple but reductive then the classical
κ-matrix is not totally fixed by the symmetry since it has a free parameter a0 , and the
K-matrix has a dynamical parameter a(~) which is not fixed by the κ(a0 u) and the bYBE
{κ(a0 u), a(~)} =⇒ K(u, ~, a(~)).
3.3. Not quasi classical K-matrices
There also exist non quasi-classical solutions of the bYBE. If g = sl(n) and ρ(1) = ρ(2) = ρ,
where ρ is the defining representation then
1
K(u) = κ + 1
u
2
is a solution for κ = 0 i.e. K(u) is not quasi classical. This K-matrix is satisfies the unitary
condition:
1
K(u)K(−u) = − 2 1.
u
The residual symmetry algebra is not reductive but a semi-direct sum of a solvable and a
reductive Lie-algebras
h = hs ⊕ hr
where hs is solvable and hr is reductive. Since
[hs , hs ] ⊂ hs ,

[hs , hr ] ⊂ hs ,

[hr , hr ] = hr ,

the above sum is semi-direct. With a suitable base change, κ can always be brought into
Jordan canonical form:

where there are k non-trivial block. The reductive sub-algebra is hr = sl(n − 2k). The
solvable part can be written in a direct sum of subspaces: hs = h2 + hD + h+ + h− where
h2 = {E2a−1,2b |a = 1, . . . , k; b = 1, . . . , k}

h− = {Ei,2a |a = 1, . . . , k; i = 2k + 1, . . . , n}

where Ei,j s are the elementary matrices: (Ei,j )ab = δia δjb . The Lie-bracket of these are the
following:
[h2 , h2 ] = [h2 , h+ ] = [h2 , h− ] = [hD , hD ] = [h+ , h+ ] = [h− , h− ] = 0
[hD , h2 ] ⊆ h2
[hD , h+ ] ⊆ h+
[hD , h− ] ⊆ h−
[h+ , h− ] ⊆ h2
Therefore [hs , hs ] := h1 = h2 + h+ + h− and [h1 , h1 ] = h2 which is a commutative Lie-algebra.
4. K-matrices with general boundary space
In this section we investigate K-matrices with dB > 1.
Definition 13. Let K(u) = Eij ⊗ Ψij (u) ∈ End(Cd ⊗ CdB ) where Eij are the elementary
matrices of End(Cd ). The K-matrix K(u) is irreducible if there is no proper invariant subspace
Cd0 ⊂ CdB of Ψij (u) for all i, j.
Corollary 14. If K(u) ∈ End(Cd ⊗ CdB ) is an irreducible K-matrix then κ̃ = κ ⊗ 1 where
κ ∈ End(Cd ).
Proof. The bYBE in the v → ∞ limit reads as
[K(u)13 , κ̃23 ] = 0.
We can write the K-matrix and the matrix κ̃ as
K(u) = Eij ⊗ Ψij (u)
κ̃

= Eij ⊗ ψ ij

where Eij s are the elementary matrices of End(Cd ) and Ψij (u), ψ ij ∈ End(CdB ) for all i, j.
Putting this into the equation above, we obtain that
 ij

Ψ (u), ψ kl = 0

for all i, j, k, l. Since K(u) is irreducible, the matrices ψ kl have to be proportional to the
identity therefore κ̃ = κ ⊗ 1.

Proposition 15. Let K(u) ∈ End(Cd ⊗CdB ) be an irreducible K-matrix in the representation

ρ(1) , ρ(2) then there exists a Lie-algebra involution α : g → g, α2 = idg for which
Adκ (ρ(2) (X)) = ρ(1) (α(X)).

is κ ⊗ 1 therefore the leading non-trivial term of the bYBE

Since this is true for all r, the equation (35) implies that

1 ⊗ U i , K(u) = 0

Theorem 17. Let K(u) be a quasi classical, irreducible (g, h) symmetric K-matrix in the

representation ρ(1) , ρ(2) then (g, h) is a symmetric pair.

Proof. Similarly to the scalar boundary case, the leading order of K(u) defines a Lie-algebra
involution α, for which Adκ (ρ(2) (X)) = ρ(1) (α(X)). This involution can be used for a Z2
graded decomposition: g = h0 ⊕ f where α(X (+) ) = +X (+) and α(X (−) ) = −X (−) for all
X (+) ∈ h0 and X (−) ∈ f therefore (g, h0 ) is a symmetric pair.
Let us assume that X ∈ h which implies that there exists a representation ρ̃ of h such
that


K(u) ρ(2) (X) ⊗ 1 − ρ(1) (X) ⊗ 1 K(u) + [K(u), 1 ⊗ ρ̃(X)] = 0.
Going to the u → ∞ limit, we obtain that κρ(2) (X) = ρ(1) (X)κ i.e. Adκ (ρ(2) (X)) = ρ(1) (X)
which means α(X) = X i.e X ∈ h0 therefore h ⊆ h0 .
Now, we take the v → ∞ limit of the bYBE:

which is equivalent to


K(u) ρ(2) (X) ⊗ 1 − ρ(1) (X) ⊗ 1 K(u) + K(u), 1 ⊗ ρ(B) (X) = 0

for all X ∈ h0 which implies that h0 ⊆ h. We have seen previously that h ⊆ h0 therefore
h0 = h i.e. (g, h) is a symmetric pair.
5. Conclusion
In this paper we derived directly from the boundary Yang-Baxter equation that the possible
residual symmetry algebras of the quasi-classical K-matrices have to be invariant sub-algebras
of Lie-algebra involutions. It was also proved that if the boundary vector space is one
dimensional then these K-matrices are universal (up to a normalization) when the residual
sub-algebra is semi-simple, and for the non semi-simple ones the K-matrices have a free
parameter. In the following it might be interesting to try to generalize these statements
and proofs to the trigonometric cases where similar classification seemed to be present
[RV16, NR18].
In addition, a not quasi-classical K-matrix was briefly examined. We have seen that its
residual symmetry algebra is a semi-direct sum of a reductive and a solvable Lie-algebra.
For further work, the classification of these may also be interesting. It is possible that
they also play a role in the classification of the integrable initial states of spin chains
[PVCP19a, PVCP19b, PPV19].
