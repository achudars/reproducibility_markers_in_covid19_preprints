Abstract
An eternal dominating set of a graph G is a set of vertices (or “guards”)
which dominates G and which can defend any infinite series of vertex attacks,
where an attack is defended by moving one guard along an edge from its current
position to the attacked vertex. The size of the smallest eternal dominating set
is denoted γ ∞ (G) and is called the eternal domination number of G. In this
paper, we answer a conjecture of Klostermeyer and Mynhardt [Discussiones
Mathematicae Graph Theory, vol. 35, pp. 283-300], showing that there exist
there are infinitely many graphs G such that γ ∞ (G) = θ(G) and γ ∞ (G✷K2 ) <
θ(G✷K2 ), where θ(G) denotes the clique cover number of G.

Introduction

Let G = (V, E) be a graph, which is assuming throughout to be simple and finite. A
set X ⊆ V (G) is called a dominating set if for every u ∈ V (G) \ X there exists an
x ∈ X such that ux ∈ E(G). Consider the following graph security model. A set of
guards begins by occupying a dominating set X in a graph G, and must respond to
an infinite sequence of attacks. By this, we mean that after a vertex u ∈
/ X is chosen
by an attacker, one guard which is adjacent to u must move from its current position
to u; necessarily, the resulting set of positions must still be a dominating set of G.
If k guards can move in this way to respond to any infinite sequence of attacks, then
1

we say G can be eternally k-guarded. The minimum k for which G can be eternally
k-guarded is called the eternal domination number of G, which is denoted γ ∞ (G).
The study of γ ∞ (G) was introduced in [1], where (among other topics) its relation
to other graph parameters was studied. Recall that an independent set of G is a set
of pairwise non-adjacent vertices, and α(G), called the independence number of G,
is the maximum cardinality of an independent set in G. A clique of G is a set of
pairwise adjacent vertices. A clique cover of G is a set {X1 , . . . , Xk } for which each
Xi is a clique and ∪ki=1 Xi = V (G). The cardinality of a minimum clique cover of G is
called the clique cover number of G and is denoted θ(G). It was shown in [1] that, for
any graph G, α(G) ≤ γ ∞ (G) ≤ θ(G). Many open questions remain regarding eternal
domination with respect to these bounding parameters, and in particular whether or
not particular constructions force γ ∞ (G) to be equal to one of them (the survey [5]
provides a nice overview of what is and is not known about eternal domination and
its variants).
We make use of two graph binary operations on graphs in this paper. The join
of two graphs G and H, denoted G ∨ H, is the graph obtained by adding all possible
edges between G and H. The Cartesian product of two graphs G and H, denoted
G✷H, has V (G✷H) = V (G) × V (H) and an edge between (u, v) and (x, y) if and
only if either u = x and vy ∈ E(H) or v = y and ux ∈ E(G). The product
G✷K2 (Kk denotes the complete graph on k vertices) is called the prism of G; one
can informally think of the prism of G as the graph obtained by taking two copies
of G and adding a matching between corresponding vertices. In [4], the following
conjecture is put forward:
Conjecture 1. [4] If G is a graph such that γ ∞ (G) = θ(G), then γ ∞ (G✷K2 ) =
θ(G✷K2 ).
The purpose of this paper is to present a construction of an infinite family of
counterexamples to this conjecture.

A Mycielskian construction

Throughout the paper, we use [n] to denote the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}. The Mycielskian
of a graph G, with V (G) = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn }, denoted M(G), is defined as follows:
V (M(G)) = V (G) ∪ {v1′ , v2′ , . . . , vn′ } ∪ {x}
E(M(G)) = E(G) ∪ E ′ ∪ X where
1. E ′ = {vi vj′ | vi vj ∈ E(G)} and
2. X = {vi′ x | i ∈ [n]}.

This construction was introduced in [6], the purpose of which was to demonstrate
the existence of triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number (recall
that the chromatic number of a graph G, denoted χ(G), is the minimum number of
colours needed to colour V (G) so that no adjacent vertices receive the same colour).
In particular, Mycielski proved the following:
Lemma 2. [6] For any graph G, χ(M(G)) = χ(G) + 1.
The following simple lemma follows directly from the construction of M(G):
Lemma 3. For any connected graph G on at least two vertices, ω(M(G)) = ω(G).
Recall that a graph is called vertex-critical if χ(G−v) < χ(G) for every v ∈ V (G).
Lemma 4. If G is a vertex-critical graph, then M(G) is vertex-critical.
Proof. Let k = χ(G) and let c be a minimum proper k-colouring of G. We proceed by
cases on the vertex v to be deleted from M(G), showing in each case that χ(M(G) −
v) = k. If v = x, then we assign c(vi′ ) = c(vi ). Suppose v = vi′ . Since G is vertex
critical, we may assume that c(vi ) is a unique colour in G. In this case c can be
extended to M(G) − vi′ by letting c(vj′ ) = c(vj ) for j 6= i and c(x) = c(vi ). Finally,
suppose that v = vi , and that c(vi ) is unique in G. In this case, c can be extended by
assigning c(vj′ ) = c(vi ) for all j, and c(x) may be given any colour used in colouring
V (G) which is distinct from c(vi ).
We now define a particular family of graphs obtained by the Mycielskian
operation. Let k ≥ 2 be an integer and let {Mlk }l≥k be a family of graphs
defined

recursively by Mkk = Kk and for each integer l > k, Mlk = M Ml−1
)
.
By
Lemmas
k
2 and 3, χ(Mlk ) = l and ω(Mlk ) = k. By applying simple induction, we also have
the following:
Lemma 5. For each 2 ≤ k ≤ l, Mlk is vertex-critical.

Main result

The construction of our family of counterexamples to Conjecture 1 requires the
following three lemmas.

Lemma 6. [3] For any graph G, γ ∞ (G) ≤ α(G)+1

Lemma 7. [2] Let G be a graph such that α(G) = a, γ ∞ (G) = g, θ(G) = t. If
p is an integer such that g ≤ p ≤ t, then α(G ∨ Kp ) = p, γ ∞ (G ∨ Kp ) = p and
θ(G ∨ Kp ) = t.

Lemma 8. Let G be a graph and let qX denote the number of cliques of cardinality
1 in a clique cover X of G. If q is the maximum value of qX taken over all clique
covers of size θ(G), then θ(G✷K2 ) = 2θ(G) − q.
Proof. Without loss of generality, suppose the vertex set of K2 is {1, 2}. Let
{C1 , C2 , . . . , Ck } be a clique cover of G and let Cji = {(v, i) : i ∈ [2], j ∈ [k], v ∈ Cj }.
For any i ∈ [2], if Gi is the subgraph induced by the vertices of the set V (G) × {i}
then {C1i , C2i , . . . , Cki } is a clique cover of Gi . For any j ∈ [k], if Cj = {v} then
Cj = {(v, 1), (v, 2)} is a clique of G✷K2 and covers the vertices (v, 1) and (v, 2).
Without loss of generality, suppose each of the cliques C1 , C2 , . . . , Cq covers a unique
vertex and each of the cliques Cq+1 , Cq+2, . . . , Ck have at least two vertices. The
set {C1 , C2 , . . . , Cq } ∪ {Cij : i ∈ {1, 2}, q + 1 ≤ j ≤ k} covers G✷K2 , hence
θ(G✷K2 ) ≤ 2θ(G) − q. Observe that a clique of G✷K2 is contained in either
G1 or G2 or the clique is of the form C = {(v, 1), (v, 2)}. The cliques contained
in G1 (respectively G2 ) with the vertices (v, 1) (respectively (v, 2)) in C cover G1
(respectively G2 ). Therefore, we then have the inverse inequality.
We now use the construction of Mlk to obtain our infinite family of
counterexamples, which may have arbitrarily large independence number, eternal
domination number, and clique cover number.
Theorem 9. For any
 integer k ≥ 2, there ∞exists a graph G such that α(G) =
γ ∞ (G) = θ(G) = k+1

let H = M . Since χ(M) = 2 + 1 and ω(M) = k, we have that α(H) = k

w ∈ V (M) there exists a proper χ-coloring of V (M) such that w receives a unique
color. As a consequence, for any given vertex w ∈ H, there exists a clique covering of
H by a minimum number of cliques where the clique
which contains w is of cardinality

the clique which contains w is of cardinality 1, since each vertex of K (k+1) can be

added to a distinct clique of H not containing w. Fix w to be any vertex in H, and
note that H ∗ has a maximum independent set I for which w ∈
/ I. Finally, let G be
∗
the graph obtained fromH by adding a single vertex x adjacent only to w. Then,
α(G) = α(H ∗)+1 = k+1
+1. By taking the minimum clique cover of H ∗ for which w

by replacing {w} with {w, x}; by Lemma 8, this implies that θ(G✷K2 ) = 2 k+1

On the other hand, denoting V (K2 ) = {1, 2}, 2 guards can protect the subgraph

guards can protect the

subgraph induced by the vertices in the set {(v, 2) : v ∈ V (H ∗)} and one guard can
protect the vertices (x, 1) and (x, 2). Thus γ ∞ (G✷K2 ) ≤ 2 k+1
+ 1 < θ(G✷K2 ).
