Abstract
In this report, we present the phased array feed (PAF) model equations for two definitions of
embedded beam patterns. In Roshi & Fisher (2016), we presented the PAF model by defining the
embedded beam pattern as the beam pattern due to a 1 V excitation to one port and all other ports
short circuited. This embedded beam pattern is referred to as voltage-embedded-beam (VEB). The
embedded beam pattern can also be defined as the beam pattern due to a 1 A excitation to one
port and all other ports open circuited. This definition is usually used in engineering literature and
we refer to the pattern as current-embedded-beam (CEB). Here we derive the relationship between
the two embedded beam patterns and present the corresponding model equations.

Introduction
Embedded beam pattern

It is convenient to express the radiation pattern of PAF in terms of the embedded beam pattern (see
Roshi & Fisher 2016). The embedded beam pattern can be defined in different ways. A definition
used in Roshi & Fisher (2016) is : the j th embedded beam pattern, E~je is the beam pattern of the
PAF when j th port is excited with 1 V (i.e. v0j = 1 V) and all other ports are short circuited (i.e.
v0i = 0 V for i 6= j; see Fig. 1a). The source impedance for excitation is considered to be equal to
z0 , the characteristic impedance of the transmission line connected to the dipole. There will be M
embedded beam patterns for a M element PAF, which are represented conveniently as a vector E~e ,
h
i
T
E~e = E~1e , E~2e , ... .
(1)
These beam patterns are functions of the position vector ~r with the origin of the coordinate system
located at the center of the PAF (see Roshi & Fisher 2016). The beam patterns are specified at
2D2

the far-field ie |~r| >> array
, where Darray is the maximum physical size of the PAF and λ is the
λ
wavelength of operation of the PAF. The radiation pattern when the PAF is excited by an arbitrary
set of port voltages is obtained by scaling the embedded beam patterns with the port voltage and
summing them up. Hence the dimension of the embedded beam pattern in this definition is m−1 .
At the far-field, the beam pattern can be described by an outgoing spherical wave,

PAF in a thermal radiation field

In this Section, we show that the open circuit voltage correlations Rt , obtained from the two
embedded beam patterns, when the the PAF is embedded in a black body radiation field are equal
to the result given by Twiss’s theorem (Twiss 1955). The correlation Rt is given by (Roshi &
