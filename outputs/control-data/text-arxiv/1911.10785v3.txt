We calculate the semileptonic and a subclass of sixteen nonleptonic two-body decays of the double
+
+
charm baryon ground states Ξ++
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc where we concentrate on the nonleptonic decay modes.
We identify those nonleptonic decay channels in which the decay proceeds solely via the factorizing
contribution precluding a contamination from W exchange. We use the covariant confined quark
model previously developed by us to calculate the various helicity amplitudes which describe the
dynamics of the 1/2+ → 1/2+ and 1/2+ → 3/2+ transitions induced by the Cabibbo-favored
effective (c → s) and (d → u) currents. We then proceed to calculate the rates of the decays as well
as polarization effects and angular decay distributions of the prominent decay chains resulting from
the nonleptonic decays of the double heavy charm baryon parent states.

INTRODUCTION

Two years ago the LHCb Collaboration reported on the discovery of the double heavy charm baryon state Ξ++
cc [1].
− + +
+
The state was found in the invariant mass spectrum of the final state particles (Λ+
K
π
π
)
where
the
Λ
baryon
c
c
was reconstructed in the decay mode pK − π + . The mass of the new state was given as 3621.40 ± 0.72 ± 0.14 ± 0.27
+
+
with a mass
MeV. A year later the LHCb Collaboration identified the same state in the decay Ξ++
cc → Ξc + π
+
++
value of 3620.6 ± 1.5(stat) ± 0.4(syst) ± 0.3(Ξc ) MeV [2]. The lifetime of the Ξcc was measured to be τ (Ξ++
cc ) =
0.256+0.024
−0.022 (stat) ± 0.014(syst) ps [3].
The weighted average of the two mass measurements of mΞ++
= 3621 ± 1.1 ± 0.3 ± 0.3 MeV is quite close to
cc
the value of 3610 MeV predicted some time ago in Ref. [4] in the framework of the one-gluon exchange model of
de Rujula et al. [5] with a Breit-Fermi spin-spin interaction term. It is noteworthy that Ebert et al. predicted a
mass of 3620 MeV for the Ξ++
cc using a relativistic quark-diquark potential model [6]. In Ref. [7] we have interpreted
− + +
the new double charm baryon state found in the (Λ+
c K π π ) mass distribution as being at the origin of the
∗0
+
+ +
++
++
decay chain Ξcc → Σc (2455; 1/2 )(→ Λc π ) + K̄ (→ K − π + ). In the present paper we extend the analysis of
Ref. [7] in two directions. First, we consider the possibility that the first step in the decay chain consists of the decay
+
+
∗0
++
where the state Σ++
Ξ++
c (2520; 3/2 ) is the spin 3/2 heavy quark symmetry partner of
cc → Σc (2520; 3/2 ) + K̄
++
+
the Σc (2455; 1/2 ). In fact, in a talk at a CERN Seminar [8] Zhang (LHCb Collaboration) showed an invariant
+
mass plot for the (Λc π + ) subsystem in which the peaking bin for m(Λc π + ) lies in between the two Σ++
c (2455; 1/2 )
+
and Σ++
(2520;
3/2
)
states.
Second,
we
provide
results
for
a
subclass
of
the
Cabibbo-favored
nonleptonic
two-body
c
+
decays of the not yet identified J P = 1/2+ double charm baryon ground states Ξ+
cc (3610) and Ωcc (3710) where the
mass values are again taken from the calculation of [4]. The authors of [6] predict a mass value of MΩ+
= 3778 MeV
cc
which is considerably higher than the value MΩ+
=
3710
calculated
in
Ref.
[4].
A
recent
lattice
calculation
quotes a
cc
+
value of 3712 ± 10 ± 12 MeV for the Ωcc state [9].
The physics of double heavy charm and bottom baryons (mass spectrum and decay properties) has been studied
before in a number of papers [4–7], [9]-[34]. We presented a detailed analysis of exclusive decays of double heavy
baryons using several versions of covariant quark models in Refs. [7, 10, 12]. Double heavy baryon decays and their
magnetic moments were treated by us in Refs. [10] where we performed a comprehensive study of the semileptonic and
radiative decays of double heavy baryons using a covariant quark model without implementing quark confinement. The
version of the covariant quark model used in [10] has been improved by incorporating quark confinement in an effective
way [35]. For the calculation of the relevant 1/2+ → 1/2+ and 1/2+ → 3/2+ transitions performed in this paper we

2
use the improved quark model which we refer to as the covariant confined quark model (CCQM). In Refs. [7, 11, 12]
we studied decay properties of double heavy baryons in the CCQM approach. In particular, in Ref. [7] we interpreted
the Ξ++
cc baryon found by the LHCb Collaboration in the invariant mass distribution of the set of final state particles
+ +
++
++
+ +
∗0
− +
(Λ+
c K π π ) as being at the origin of the decay chain Ξcc → Σc (→ Λc π ) + K̄ (→ K π ). The nonleptonic

→
Σ
K̄
belongs
to
the
class
of
factorizing
decays,
i.e.
the
decays
precluding
a contamination from
cc
c
internal W exchange. As a byproduct of our investigation we have also analyzed the nonleptonic mode with K̄ 0 in
the final state. In Ref. [11] we proposed a novel method for the evaluation of the nonfactorizing (three quark loop)
diagrams generated by W –exchange and contributing to the nonleptonic two-body decays of the doubly charmed
+
baryons Ξ++
cc and Ωcc . The W –exchange contributions appear in addition to the factorizable tree graph contributions
and are not suppressed in general. In Ref. [12] we reviewed novel ideas in the theoretical description of nonleptonic
decays of double heavy baryons. In the present paper we extend our analysis of semileptonic decays of double charm
baryons started in Ref. [10] by inclusion of all factorizable modes for both types of weak transitions — semileptonic
and nonleptonic using the updated theoretical framework — CCQM model. Note that in our paper Ref. [10] we used
′
+
mass values for the single and double charm baryons masses Ξ++
cc = 3.61 GeV and Ξc = 2.47 GeV, which differ
′
++
+
from the updated mass values used in the present paper (Ξcc = 3.6206 GeV and Ξc = 2.5774 GeV [36]). When
comparing the relevant semileptonic rate in [10] to that in the present paper one has to take the changed mass values
into account, which results in a suppression of our 2001 result by a factor of ∼ 1.6 which is mostly kinematical in
nature.
Our paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II we discuss the decay topologies of the Cabibbo-favored nonleptonic
+
+
two-body decays of the double charm baryon ground states Ξ++
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc . Of the many possible decays we
identify 16 decays which proceed via the factorizing contributions alone. In Sec. III we collect material on the spin
kinematics of the decays. We define invariant form factors and helicity amplitudes. We also write down formulas for
the semileptonic and nonleptonic rates. In Sec. IV we list a set of local interpolating three-quark currents with the
correct quantum numbers of the baryon states that they describe. The nonlocal versions of the interpolating currents
enter the calculation of the various transition form factors in our covariant confined quark model (CCQM). We also
give a brief description of the main features of our CCQM calculation. Sec. V contains our numerical results for the
semileptonic and nonleptonic rates and branching fractions. In Sec. V we also discuss polarization effects and angular
decay distributions of the eight semileptonic and 16 nonleptonic cascade decays. In Sec. VI we summarize our results
and outline our follow-up program of further calculations involving also W –exchange contributions to the nonleptonic
decays of double heavy charm baryons.
II.

DECAY TOPOLOGIES OF CABIBBO-FAVORED DOUBLE HEAVY CHARM BARYON
NONLEPTONIC DECAYS

We begin by a discussion of the different color-flavor topologies that contribute to the various possible nonleptonic
+
+
two-body transitions of the double heavy Ξ++
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc states. The relevant topologies are displayed in Fig. 1.
We refer to the topologies of Ia and Ib as tree diagrams. They are sometimes also referred to as external (Ia) and
internal W -emission (Ib) diagrams. The topologies IIa, IIb and III are referred to as W –exchange diagrams. In [37]
they are denoted as the Exchange (IIa), color-commensurate (IIb) and Bow tie (III) diagram. As shown in Fig. 1 the
color-flavor factor of the tree diagrams Ia and Ib depends on whether the emitted meson is charged or neutral. For
charged emission the color-flavor factor is given by the linear combination of Wilson coefficients (C2 + ξC1 ), where
ξ = 1/Nc , while for neutral emission the color-flavor factor reads (C1 + ξC2 ). We take C1 = −0.51 and C2 = 1.20
from Ref. [38]. We use the large Nc limit for the color-flavor factors. For the W –exchange diagrams not treated in
this paper the color-flavor factor is given by (C2 − C1 ).
In Table I we provide a complete list of the Cabibbo-favored ground-state to ground-state nonleptonic two-body
decays of double heavy charm baryons together with the color-flavor topologies that contribute to these decays. For
reasons of compactness we employ a star notation for the spin 3/2 ground state baryons which differs from the notation
suggested by the Particle Data Group (PDG). Thus, for example, our Ω∗c 0 stands for the spin 3/2 partner of the spin
1/2 state Ω0c . The spin 3/2 state Ω∗c 0 is listed in the PDG [36] as Ωc (2770)0 .
In this paper we restrict our analysis to those nonleptonic decays whose decay dynamics is solely determined by
the tree diagram contributions Ia and Ib. There are two classes of such decays which we discuss in turn.
• The first class of decays is solely contributed to by the two topologies Ia and Ib. These decays can be identified
by necessary and sufficient conditions for the quarks involved in the two-body nonleptonic transitions which we
label according to the following scheme
B1 (q1 q2 q3 ) → B2 (q1′ q2′ q3′ ) + M (qm q̄n̄ ) .

A necessary condition for the contribution of the factorizing class of decays is that a quark pair qi qj = qi′ qj′ is
shared by the parent and daughter baryon B1 and B2 , respectively. A sufficient condition for the factorizing
class of decays is that (i) qm is not among q1 , q2 , q3 and (ii) qn̄ is not among q1′ , q2′ , q3′ . Using these two criteria
we have identified the two groups of decays

which proceed via the tree graphs alone.
• The second class of decays involves in addition to the tree topologies also the W –exchange topologies IIb which,
however, do not contribute because of the Körner, Pati, and Woo (KPW) theorem [39, 40]. The Körner, Pati,

4
and Woo theorem states that the contraction of the flavor antisymmetric current-current operator with a flavor
symmetric final state configuration is 0. There are two groups of decays that belong to this class given by

We neglect SU(3) breaking effects when applying the KPW theorem to the above two groups of decays. We
plan to quantify the SU(3) breaking effects in a future dynamical calculation of these decays.
+
+
The recently observed decay Ξ++
cc → Ξc + π [2] is not discussed in this paper since, in addition to the tree diagram
Ia, there is a non-vanishing contribution from the W –exchange diagram IIb. In this context it is interesting to observe
that the decays

induced by the topologies IIb and III are predicted to be altogether zero due to the KPW theorem. It would be very
interesting to experimentally confirm this prediction.
Let us add a few comments concerning the W –exchange diagrams. The contribution of the W –exchange diagrams
cannot be neglected even if this is frequently done in the analysis of nonleptonic charm baryon decays. A prominent
0 +
example is the decay Λ+
which is contributed to by the topologies IIa, IIb, and III, i.e. there are no
c → Σ π
tree graph contributions to the decay. Nevertheless, its experimental branching ratio is comparable to that of the
0 +
decay mode Λ+
where the latter mode is also contributed to by the tree diagram 1a. The interplay of the
c → Λ π
tree and W –exchange diagrams for the Cabibbo-favored ∆C = 1 nonleptonic charm baryon decays has been studied
in [41–44] and also in a previous version of our model [45]. We hope to return to the calculation of the W –exchange
contributions in single charm and double charm baryon decays in the framework of our CCQM quark model. We
mention that the evaluation of the W -exchange diagrams in our approach is technically quite demanding since it
involves a three-loop calculation. Naturally it is of utmost importance to get the relative signs between the tree and
W –exchange contributions right since this decides whether the two classes of contributions interfere constructively
or destructively. A first attempt to estimate the W –exchange contributions to the 1/2+ → 1/2+ + 0− double heavy
baryon decays has been published in [25] using a baryon pole model for the W –exchange contributions. There is a
one-to-one correspondence between the 1/2+ → 1/2+ + 0− decays treated in [25] and the 1/2+ → 1/2+ + 0− decays
listed in Table I. The W –exchange topology structure of the decays written down in [25] in terms of s–channel and
u–channel contributions is consistent with the corresponding topology structure in Table I.
Returning to the factorizing contributions we in the following discuss the class 1 and class 2 decays listed in Eqs. (2)
and (3), respectively, which are determined by the factorizing contributions alone.

MATRIX ELEMENTS, HELICITY AMPLITUDES AND DECAY RATES EXPRESSIONS

M (B1 → B2 + M ) = √ Vij Vkl∗ Ceff fM MM hB2 |q̄2 Oµ q1 |B1 i ǫ† µ (λM ) ,

(5)

where M = V and M = P stand for the vector and pseudoscalar meson cases such that MM and fM are the respective
masses MV , MP and leptonic decay constants fV , fP . The Dirac string Oµ is defined by Oµ = γ µ (1 − γ 5 ). Here Vij
are the Cabibbo-Kabayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements: Vud = 0.97420 and Vcs = 0.997.
Here Ceff is the combination of the Wilson coefficients (C2 + ξC1 ), where ξ = 1/Nc and Nc is the number of colors,
while for neutral emission the color-flavor factor reads (C1 + ξC2 ). We take C1 = −0.51 and C2 = 1.20 at µ = mc =
1.3 GeV from Ref. [38]. We use the large Nc limit for the color-flavor factors. It is known, that nonfactorizable
contributions coming from, e.g., one-gluon exchange, might be important for the description of nonleptonic decays.
As an example, recall the well-known decay B → J/ψ + K, which is proportional to the coefficient a2 = C1 + ξC2 and
would thus be predicted to be 0 for Nc = 3. In this case naive factorization clearly does not describe the experimental
data. The discussion on and determination of the nonfactorizable corrections to the coefficient a2 has been actively
pursued in the literature using various techniques. However, as far as we know, up to now there is no well-established
framework in which the nonfactorizable contributions could be taken into account in a self-consistent way. Therefore,
we employ a phenomenological and simple assumption in our calculations of the nonleptonic decays of both heavy
mesons and baryons that the color factor ξ = 1/Nc appearing in the combination of the Wilson coefficients is set to 0.
This assumption has been extensively used in the literature and is well justified in the comparison with experimental
data in the meson sector.

where σµν = (i/2)(γµ γν − γν γµ ) and all γ matrices are defined as in Bjorken-Drell.
The results of a covariant dynamical calculation as in the present case are usually obtained in terms of the invariant
form factors defined above. To proceed further, it is very convenient to convert the set of invariant form factors
to a set of helicity amplitudes where the two sets are linearly related. We therefore express the vector and axial
V /A
V /A
helicity amplitudes Hλ2 λM in terms of the invariant form factors Fi , where λM = t, ±1, 0 and λ2 = ±1/2, ±3/2
are the helicity components of the meson M (M = P, V ) and the baryon B2 , respectively. We need to calculate the
expressions
Hλ2 λM = hB2 (p2 , λ2 )|q̄2 Oµ q1 |B1 (p1 , λ1 )iǫ† µ (λM ) = HλV2 λM − HλA2 λM

(8)

where we split the helicity amplitudes into their vector and axial parts. For the color enhanced decays the operator
q̄2 Oµ q1 represents a charged current transition while, for the color suppressed decays, q̄2 Oµ q1 describes a neutral
current transition. We work in the rest frame of the baryon B1 with the baryon B2 moving in the positive zdirection: p1 = (M1 , ~0), p2 = (E2 , 0, 0, |p2 |) and q = (q0 , 0, 0, −|p2|). The helicities of the three particles are related
by λ1 = λ2 − λM . We use the notation λP = λt = 0 for the scalar (J = 0) contribution in order to set the helicity
label apart from λV = 0 used for the longitudinal component of the J = 1 vector meson. The relations connecting
the helicity amplitudes to the invariant form factors are given

We use the abbreviations M± = M1 ± M2 , Q± = M±
− q 2 . The magnitude of the momentum of the daughter baryon
p
B2 is given by |p2 | = Q+ Q− /2M1 = λ1/2 (M12 , M22 , q 2 )/(2M1 ).

Let us add a few remarks on the helicity composition of the vector and axial vector helicity amplitudes. At the zero
recoil point q 2 = (M1 − M2 )2 the vector helicity amplitudes vanish and the transverse-to-longitudinal composition
can be seen to be given by FL /FT = 1/2 for both 1/2+ → 1/2+, 3/2+ transitions (“allowed Fermi-Teller transition”).
At the other end of the q 2 -spectrum at q 2 = 0 the longitudinal mode dominates. These findings have a bearing on
the transverse-to-longitudinal composition of the vector mesons in the nonleptonic decays to be discussed later on.
Using the helicity amplitudes one can write down very compact expressions for the various decay rates. The
semileptonic decay width is given by (mℓ = 0)
Γ(B1 → B2 + ℓ+ νℓ ) =

(M1 −M2 )2

INTERPOLATING CURRENTS AND CALCULATION OF THE TRANSITION FORM FACTORS
IN THE CONFINED COVARIANT QUARK MODEL (CCQM)

As described in the introduction we use the confined covariant quark model (CCQM) to calculate the various
1/2+ → 1/2+ and 1/2+ → 3/2+ transition form factors FiV,A (q 2 ) that are needed in the calculation of the helicity
amplitudes. We describe the coupling of the baryons with the constituent quarks by nonlocal extensions of the
interpolating currents (see details in Refs. [7, 10], [45]-[50]). In Table II we list the interpolating currents needed in
the present application.

The three constituent quarks are treated as separate dynamic entities which propagate with fully covariant fermion
propagators Sq (k) = 1/(mq − k/) in the two-loop Feynman diagram which describes the current-induced transition
between the respective baryons. The propagator masses mq are constituent quark masses fixed in previous analyses
of a multitude of hadronic processes within our approach (see, e.g., Refs. [46, 47]).
Apart from the choice of the interpolating current and the constituent quark masses there are two parameters
that describe the structure of a baryon in the CCQM. These are the coupling factor of the baryon to its constituent
quarks gB and the size parameters ΛB characterizing the size of the nonlocal distribution of the quarks in the
baryons. The coupling factor gB and the size parameter ΛB become related by the compositeness condition of
Salam and Weinberg [51, 52]. By analogy we treat mesons as bound states of a constituent quark and an antiquark,
i.e. we construct respective nonlocal interaction Lagrangians of mesons with their constituent quarks (see details in
Refs. [35, 49]).
The details of calculating the 1/2+ → 1/2+ and 1/2+ → 3/2+ transition form factors between baryons have been
discussed in detail in Refs. [7, 10], [45]-[50] and need not be repeated here.

POLARIZATION, LONGITUDINAL/TRANSVERSE HELICITY FRACTIONS AND ANGULAR
DECAY DISTRIBUTIONS

+
+
Since the semileptonic and nonleptonic two-body decays of the Ξ++
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc are mediated by weak interactions
one can expect sizable polarization effects in these decays entailing nontrivial angular decay distributions in the decays
+
+
of the mesons and baryons further down the decay chains. We treat the initial state baryons Ξ++
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc as
being unpolarized. In principle, the parent baryons could acquire a nonzero transverse polarization in the hadronic
production process which would depend on the rapidity of the baryon in question. However, since one is usually
averaging over the rapidities of the production process, the parent baryons become effectively unpolarized (for more
details see [47]).

A.

Semileptonic decays

+
+
We only consider the Cabibbo-favored semileptonic decays of the double heavy charm baryons Ξ++
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc
induced by the quark level c → s transition. The Cabibbo-suppressed semileptonic decays induced by the quark level
c → d transitions are suppressed by an overall factor (Vcd /Vcs )2 = 0.049. The Cabibbo suppression factor (Vcd /Vcs )2
is partly offset by the larger phase space of the ∆S = 1 Cabibbo-suppressed decays which then amounts to an overall
suppression factor of ∼ 0.1 (see e.g. [31]).
The Q values of the semileptonic c → s decays discussed here are not large enough to allow for the semileptonic
τ modes. On the other hand, the Q values are sufficiently large to allow one to neglect the lepton masses in the
semileptonic e+ - and µ+ -modes.

9
taking the q 2 –averages one has to integrate the numerators and denominators separately including the factor |p2 |q 2
(see Eq.(12)). The q 2 –dependent helicity fractions are defined by
1/2+ → 1/2+ :

F+ (q 2 ) = |Ĥ1/2,1 |2

where λ2 = 1/2, 3/2 for F+ (q 2 ) and λ2 = −1/2, −3/2 for F− (q 2 ) in the 1/2+ → 3/2+ case. Since we use normalized
helicity amplitudes Ĥλ2 λM [see Eq.(16)] the helicity fractions satisfy F+ (q 2 ) + F0 (q 2 ) + F− (q 2 ) = 1. The angular

can be discussed along the lines of [48].

angles θV , θB and χ describing the angular structure of the decay are defined in Fig. 2. We have again used the
orthonormality property Eq. (23) in the reduction of the first row of Eq. (27). The seeming threefold angular
decay distribution has collapsed to a onefold angular decay distribution. In particular, the azimuthal correlation

The vector mesons on the meson side of the decay chain can be transversely and longitudinally polarized. We

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have cataloged all Cabibbo-favored semileptonic and nonleptonic two-body decays of the three double heavy
+
+
charm baryon states Ξ++
cc , Ξcc and Ωcc where the nonleptonic two-body decays are into ground state mesons and
−
baryons. For the semileptonic decays we have calculated rates, branching ratios and helicity fractions of the Woff−shell
using transition form factors calculated in our CCQM quark model. For the nonleptonic decays we have analyzed the
topology structure of their various two-body decays in terms of the two W –emission (external and internal) or tree
++ (∗)
+ K̄ 0(∗)
topologies and the three W –exchange topologies. We have identified two groups of decays Ξ++
cc → Σc
0
(∗)
and Ω+
+ π + (ρ+ ) which proceed by W –emission alone and are thus theoretically favored since there is no
cc → Ωc
′(∗)+
contamination from W –exchange contributions. The W –exchange contributions to the decays Ξ++
+π + (ρ+ )
cc → Ξc
′(∗)+
+
(∗)0
and Ωcc → Ξc
+ K̄
vanish in the SU (3) limit as a consequence of the Körner-Pati-Woo theorem Using again
transition amplitudes from our CCQM quark model for the latter decays we have calculated rates, branching ratios
and angular coefficients that characterize the angular decay distributions of the one-sided or two-sided cascade decays
of the above two classes of decays. The angular decay distributions involving the 1/2+ → 1/2+ baryon transitions
are markedly different from those of the 1/2+ → 3/2+ transitions. In particular, in the 1/2+ → 1/2+1− cascade
++
+
∗0
decay Ξ++
there are no azimuthal correlations between the two planes formed by the
cc → Σc (2455; 1/2 ) + K̄
++
+
+
∗0
second stage decays Σc (2455; 1/2 ) → Λ+
→ K − π + ) whereas the two decay planes become azimuthally
c π and K̄
∗++
correlated in the 1/2+ → 3/2+ + 1− cascade decay Ξ++
(2520; 3/2+) + K̄ ∗0 . Another discriminating feature
cc → Σc
of these two possible decay paths is that there is pronounced dip in the cos θ distribution in the latter case.
+
Any of the two-body nonleptonic decays of the Ξ+
cc and Ωcc listed in Table I could be explored in the search for the
two missing double heavy charm baryon states. If one takes the discovery channels of the Ξ++
cc as a guide the decays

Ξcc → Λc (Σc ) + K̄
