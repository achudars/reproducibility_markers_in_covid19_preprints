A NOTE ON A SHEAF OF REAL REGULAR FUNCTIONS
SHAHRAM MOHSENIPOUR
Abstract. Coste and Roy defined in [2] a structural sheaf on the
real Zariski spectrum of P
a semi-real ring A and asked whether the
−1
ring of global sections is
1 A when Σ1 is the multiplicative subset
Pn

{1 + i=1 ai |ai ∈ A, n ∈ N ∪ {0}} of A. We give a positive answer to
this question in the case of A is a real ring.

1. Introduction
By a ring we mean a commutative with identity. Let A be a semi-real
ring. The real Zariski spectrum of A denoted by SpecR (A) is a topological
space whose underlying set is the set of all real prime ideals of A and its
topology is described as follows. Let I be an ideal of A, we define V (I) as
the set all real prime ideals p of A with p ⊇ I. We have
Lemma 1.1. (i) If I and J are two ideals of A,P
then V (IJ)
T = V (I) ∪ V (J).
(ii) If {Ii } is any set of ideals of A, then V ( Ii ) = V (Ii√
).
√
R
(iii) If I and J are two ideals, V (I) ⊆ V (J) if and only if I ⊇ R J.
√
Proof. The same as ([3], Lemma 2.1) and see Theorem 1.3 below for R I. 
Now take the subsets of the form V (I) to be the closed subsets. This
defines a topology on SpecR (A) which we call the real Zariski topology of
SpecR (A). Note that V (A) = ∅ and V ({0}) = SpecR (A). For any element
f ∈ A, we denote by D(f ) the open complement of V ((f )). It is easy to
see that the open sets of the form D(f ) form a basis for the topology of
SpecR (A). An open set of the form D(f ) is called a principal open subset
while its complement V ((f )) is called a principal closed subset.
Now for a semi-real ring A, Coste and Roy defined a sheaf of rings
OSpecR (A) on the real Zariski spectrum SpecR (A) as follows [2].
` For an open
U ⊆ SpecR (A), OSpecR (A) (U ) consists of all functions s : U → p∈SpecR (A) Ap ,
satisfying the following two conditions1. Firstly for all p ∈ U we have
s(p) ∈ Ap , secondly for each p ∈ U there is a neighborhood Up of p in U and
also a, f ∈ A such that for all q ∈ Up we have f ∈
/ q and s(q) = fa ∈ Aq . For

V ⊆ U we define OSpecR (A) (U ) → OSpecR (A) (V ) by the restriction of functions. Let X = SpecR (A) and p ∈ X, it is easily seen that there is a canonical isomorphism
OX,p ∼
= Ap . We denote by Σ1 the multiplicative subset
Pn

{1 + i=1 ai |ai ∈ A, n ∈ N ∪ {0}} of A. P
Also for a nonzero f ∈ A we denote
by Σf the multiplicative subset {f 2m + ni=1 a2i |ai ∈ A, m, n ∈ N ∪ {0}} of
A. Obviously if A is a semi-real ring, then Σ1 6= ∅ and if A a real ring, then
Σf 6= ∅. Now we are able to state Coste and Roy’s question.

Question 1.2 ([2], Page 48). Do we have −1
f A = O X (D(f ))?
P
We show in Theorem 2.3 that the canonical homomorphism from −1
f A
into OX (D(f )) is always injective and in the case of A being a real ring is
surjective. Hence an isomorphism. We don’t know whether this is the case
for every semi-real ring. We shall make several use of the abstract version
of the real Nullstellensatz.
Theorem 1.3 ([1], Proposition 4.1.7). Let A be a commutative ring and I
an ideal of A. Then

I = {a ∈ A | ∃m ∈ N ∃b1 , . . . , bp ∈ A a2m + b21 + · · · + b2p ∈ I}

is the smallest real ideal of A containing I. The ideal R I, called the real
radical of I, is the intersection of all real prime ideals containing I (or is A
itself if there is no real prime ideal containing I).

2. The ring of global sections
Lemma 2.1. For any f ∈ A, D(f ) is quasi-compact.

Proof. Let D(fi ), i ∈ I be a open cover of D(f ), then V ((f )) = i∈I V ((fi )) =

P
V ( i∈I (fi )). So f ∈ R i∈I (fi ) and it follows that there are a1 , . . . , ak in
P
A and fi1 , . . . , fik such that a1 fi1 +· · ·+ak fik = f 2m + x2 for some m ∈ N.
Therefore
X
D(f ) ⊆ D(f 2m +
x2 ) = D(a1 fi1 + · · · + ak fik ) ⊆ D(fi1 ) ∪ · · · ∪ D(fik ),
thus D(f ) has a finite subcover.



Now we will need the following useful lemma.
Lemma 2.2 (Basic Lemma). Let X = SpecR (A), f ∈ A and s ∈ OX (D(f )),
then there are g1 , . . . , gn ∈ A such that D(f ) = D(g1 ) ∪ · · · ∪ D(gn ) and
s ↾ D(gi ) = agii for some ai ∈ A.

Proof. Let D(f ) = {pi |i ∈ I}, then each pi has a neighborhood D(hi ) ⊆
D(f ) such that s ↾ D(hi ) = fbii so that for all q ∈ D(hi ) we have fi ∈
/ q. This
Pi 2

means that D(hi ) ⊆ D(fi ) for i ∈ I which implies that hi +

for some ni ∈ N and i x2 , ui ∈ A. Thus s ↾ D(hi ) = fbii = 2niui P

set ai = ui bi h2i and gi = h2i (hi2ni + i x2 ), so s ↾ D(hi ) = agii . Observing
that

we get s ↾ D(gi ) = agii . Also i∈I D(gi ) = i∈I D(hi ) = D(f ), then by
quasi-compactness we can choose finitely many of D(gi ) covering D(f ). 
Theorem 2.3. Let A be a real ring, f ∈ A and let X = SpecR (A), then

OX (D(f )) ∼

OX (D(1)) = OX (SpecR (A)) ∼

Proof. We define a map ψ :
f A → O X (D(f )) by sending f 2n + x2 to
s ∈ OX (D(f )) where s(p) = f 2n +aP x2 for all p ∈ D(f ). Obviously ψ is
homomorphism. We first show that ψ is injective. Note that for injectivity
we do not need A is real. Let ψ( f 2n +aP x2 ) = ψ( f 2m +bP y2 ) = s ∈ OX (D(f )),
then for any p ∈ D(f ), both f 2n +aP x2 and f 2m +bP y2 are equal to s(p) ∈ Ap .
Hence there is h ∈
/ p such that

h a(f 2m +

Let I be the annihilator of a(f 2m + y 2 ) − b(f 2n + x2 ), then h ∈ I, h ∈

so I * p. This holds
for

D(f

so
we
conclude
that

Therefore f ∈ I, thus there are k ∈ N and

Observing that (f 2k + z 2 ) ∈ f , we get f 2n +aP x2 = f 2m +bP y2 in −1
f A.
Hence ψ is injective.
Let’s show that ψ is surjective. Let s ∈ OX (D(f )), by Basic Lemma there
are g1 , . . . , gn ∈ A such that D(f ) = D(g1 ) ∪ · · · ∪ D(gn ) and s ↾ D(gi ) = agii
for some ai ∈ A. So for any p ∈ D(gi gj ) = D(gi ) ∩ D(gj ), there is hp ∈
/ p
such that hp (ai gj − aj gi ) = 0 in A. Let I be the annihilator of ai gj − aj gi ,
so hp ∈ I, hp ∈
/ p thus p + I and this holds for any p ∈ D(gi g√j ), therefore
we have V (I) ∩ D(gi gj ) = Ø from which it follows that gi gj ∈ R I. So there
P
are mij ∈ N and ij x2 in A such that
Xij 

(gi gj )2mij +
x2 (ai gj − aj gi ) = 0.
By reality of A we have
(gi gj )mij (ai gj − aj gi ) = 0.

So taking m larger than all mij we get (gi gj )m (ai gj − aj gi ) = 0 for all
i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Rewriting as
gjm+1 (gim ai ) − gim+1 (gjm aj ) = 0

and then replacing each gi by gim+1 , and ai by gim ai , we still have s represented on D(gi ) by agii and furthermore, we have gi aj = gj ai for all i, j ∈
T
P
{1, . . . , n}. On
the other hand having V ((f )) = ni=1 V ((gi )) = V ( ni=1 (gi ))

P
we get f ∈ R ni=1 (gi ) and it follows that there are b1 , . . . , bk in A such that

b1 g1 + · · · + bn gn = f 2k + x2 for some k. Now let a = a1 b1 + · · · + an bn .
Then for each j we have
