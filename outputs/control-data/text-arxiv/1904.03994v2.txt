The operators ∇+s and ∇−s can be viewed as the fractional extensions of the gradient operator

⊲ If 0 < s < p = 1 < n, then the right-hand-side of (1.2) can be replaced by k∇−s ukL1 (cf.
[25, Theorem A′ ]) but cannot be replaced by k∇+s ukL1 (cf. [33, p.119]).
⊲ If 0 < s < p = 1 = n, then the right-hand-side of (1.2) cannot be replaced by either
k∇+s ukL1 or k∇−s ukL1 . A counterexample is given in [25, Section 3.3].
⊲ If 0 < s < p = 1 ≤ n, then instead of the strong-type estimates, one has the following

Also, write S′ for the Schwartz tempered distribution space - the dual of S endowed with the

then for any
u ∈ S′s ⊂ S′
we can define ∇±s u as a distribution in S′ . This definition and the case p = 1 of (1.2) motivate
us to consider the fractional Hardy-Sobolev space
n
o
s
H s,1 = u ∈ S′s : [u]H s,1 = k(−∆) 2 ukH 1 < ∞ .
Note that

u1 − u2 = constant ⇔ [u1 ]H s,1 = [u2 ]H s,1 .
So, [·]H s,1 is properly a norm on quotient space of H s,1 modulo the space of all real constants,
and consequently this quotient space is a Banach space.
Upon introducing
n
o
H±s,1 = u ∈ S′s : [u]H±s,1 = k∇±s ukL1 < ∞ ,

we immediately find

H s,1 = H+s,1 ∩ H−s,1 .
Also, since S is dense in H s,1 but it is hard to see the density of S in H±s,1 , we are induced to
introduce
H̊±s,1 = closure of S in H±s,1 under [·]H±s,1 ,
and yet still have
H s,1 = H̊+s,1 ∩ H̊−s,1
whose H̊±s,1 is a Banach space modulo the space of all real constants.
Correspondingly, for s ∈ (0, 1) let W s,1 be the collection of all locally integrable functions u
on Rn obeying
Z Z
|u(x) − u(y)|
dy dx < ∞.
[u]W s,1 =
n+s
Rn Rn |x − y|
Then the quotient space of W s,1 modulo the space of all real constants is equal to the homoges
neous Besov space Λ̇1,1
(cf. [38]) and is also called Sobolev-Slobodeckij space (cf. [36, p. 36])
or fractional Sobolev space (cf. [23]), and hence
n

S∞ = f ∈ S : Dα fˆ(0) = 0 ∀ α ∈ Zn+

it follows that
[u]H s,1 = k∇+s ukL1 + k∇−s ukL1 . [u]W s,1 ∀ u ∈ S.

(1.4)

Thus, both H s,1 and H̊±s,1 contain W s,1 . More information on {∇±s , H s,1 , H±s,1 } is demonstrated in
Propositions 2.11-2.12-2.13-2.14.

3.5-3.6. Then, we verify (1.8)⇔(1.9) in Theorem 3.7.

Duality laws for H s,1 & H̊±s,1 . As a by-product of (1.3)-(1.4) and the capacity analysis developed within §3, Theorem 4.3 shows that the dual space [H s,1 ]∗ can be characterized by the
bounded solutions

Also, a similar characterization for

is presented in Theorem 4.3 in terms of the bounded solutions to the fractional differential

with 1[−1,1] being the characteristic function of the interval [−1, 1]. Let us take the space Is (L s )
for example to explain why we require the validity of (1.10) in the sense of S′ /P. Indeed, if
n
f ∈ L s , then Is f may not be pointwisely well defined, but it is a well defined distribution in
S′ /P.
Nevertheless, the importance of (1.10) can be also seen below.
⊲ Via a different approach, (1.10) reveals the essential structure of the Riesz transform

⊲ (1.10) may be treated as a solution to the Bourgain-Brezis question (cf. [6, p.396])
1,n
- What are the function

that W 1,n obeys the following decomposition ([6, p.305])
~ · L∞ ∩ W 1,n n under n ≥ 2.
W 1,n = R

⊲ As proved in [22, Theorem 3.5] (solving the open problem in [5, Remark 3.12]), if BV

This indicates that (1.10) has a limiting case s ↑ 1:

W 1,n ⊂ I1 [BV]∗ ⊂ BMO under n ≥ 2.
⊲ (1.10) improves [29, Corollary 1.5] which proves that

Although W 1,n=1 is a proper subspace of L∞ on R, the foregoing consequence cannot
be extended to

and hence the integral in the right-hand-side of (2.2) converges absolutely.
To show (2.2), we take an arbitrary open set Ω0 ∋ x compactly contained in Ω. According
to the proof of [28, Proposition 2.4], there exists a sequence { fk }k∈N ⊂ S uniformly bounded in
C s+ǫ (Ω), converging uniformly to f in Ω0 and also converging to f in the norm of L s . For any

(ii) If φ ∈ S′s , then ∇−s φ = I1−s ∇φ in S′/P.
(iii) If φ ∈ S, then all identities in (i) hold almost everywhere on Rn .
Proof. (i) Via the Fourier transform, we see that
s

I1−s , (−∆) 2 & R1≤ j≤n
map S∞ into S∞ . Then, taking the inverse Fourier transform verifies the assertion in (i).
(ii) Let
(φ, j, ψ) ∈ S′s × {1, 2, . . . , n} × S∞ .
Then by the just-checked (i) and Definition 2.7 we have
h∇sj φ, ψi = −hφ, ∇sj ψi = −hφ, ∂ x j I1−s ψi
Further, since
φ ∈ S′s ⇒ φ ∈ S′ ⇒ ∂x j φ ∈ S′ ⊂ S′ /P,
this implication, along with the fact that I1−s maps S′ /P onto S′ /P, derives
−hφ, ∂ x j I1−s ψi = h∂ x j φ, I1−s ψi = hI1−s ∂ x j φ, ψi,
namely,
∇sj φ = I1−s ∂ x j φ

in S′ /P.

(iii) Observe that S∞ is dense in L p whenever p ∈ (1, ∞). Indeed, this follows easily from
the fact that the Calderón reproducing formula of an L p -function

Thus, if φ ∈ S, then a discussion similar to (ii) yields that the identity in (i) holds in S′ /P.
Moreover, by the density of S∞ in L2 and the duality equality
kukL2 = sup {|hu, φi| : φ ∈ S∞ , kφkL2 ≤ 1} ,
we obtain that the identity in (i) holds in L2 and hence almost everywhere on Rn .

The first and second dense subspaces of H s,1 . Lemma 2.10 produces the following property.
Proposition 2.11. Let s ∈ (0, 1). Then
(i) H s,1 ∩ S∞ = Is (S∞ ∩ H 1 ).
(ii) Is (H 1 ) ⊂ H s,1 .
(iii) For any f ∈ H s,1 there exists g ∈ H 1 such that f = Is g in S′ /P.

get

f = Is g in S′ /P with g = (−∆) 2 f ∈ H 1 .

Next, we have the following density result.
Proposition 2.12. If s ∈ (0, 1), then
S∞ ⊂ S ⊂ H s,1 ⊂ H±s,1 .
Moreover, both S∞ and S are dense in H s,1 .
Proof. For any u ∈ S, we use Lemma 2.10 to derive
s

(−∆) 2 u ∈ H 1 i.e. u ∈ H s,1 .
This proves S ⊂ H s,1 ; the other inclusions are obvious.
It remains to show the density of S∞ in H s,1 . If f ∈ H s,1 , then

Due to the density of S∞ in H 1 ,
s

∃ {g j } j∈N ⊂ S∞ such that lim kg j − (−∆) 2 f kH 1 → 0.

For any j ∈ N, let

A dense subspace of H+s,1 . It is difficult to determine the density of S in H±s,1 . However, we
have
Proposition 2.13. If s ∈ (0, 1), then Is (S) is a dense subspace of H+s,1 but
Is (S) 1 H−s,1 .
Proof. On the one hand, if f ∈ Is (S) then
∃ φ ∈ S such that f = Is φ,
but Lemma 2.3 implies

s

s

(−∆) 2 f = (−∆) 2 Is φ = φ ∈ S ⊂ L1 ,
that is, f ∈ H+s,1 . To show the density of Is (S) in H+s,1 , given any f ∈ H+s,1 we utilize
s

(−∆) 2 f ∈ L1
and the density of S in L1 to find a sequence
{g j } j∈N ⊂ S
such that

s

lim kg j − (−∆) 2 f kL1 = 0.

Upon defining
f j = Is g j ∈ Is (S)
and using Lemma 2.3, we gain the representation

g j = (−∆) 2 f j
and the desired convergence

In other words, Is (S) is a dense subspace of H+s,1 .
On the other hand, Is (S) is not a subspace of H−s,1 - otherwise - if Is (S) ⊂ H−s,1 , then this,
along with Is (S) ⊂ H+s,1 , would imply Is (S) ⊂ H s,1 and hence S ⊂ H 1 which is impossible. 
The third dense subspace of H s,1 . In addition to Proposition 2.12, we obtain
Proposition 2.14. If s ∈ (0, 1), then

So, it suffices to show the density of D0 in H s,1 . Let f ∈ H s,1 . Based on Proposition 2.11(iii),
∃ g ∈ H 1 such that f = Is g in S′ /P.

Note that H 1 is nothing but the homogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin space Ḟ 1,2

Furthermore, CapX (·) is extendable from compact sets to general sets as seen below.

(ii) For an arbitrary set E ⊂ Rn set

Thus, the definition of CapX on any compact/open set is consistent (cf. [19, Lemma 3.2.4]).

Then
(i) CapX (∅) = 0 & CapX (B(x, r)) = rn−s CapX (B(0, 1)).

max Cap H+s,1 (·), CapH−s,1 (·) ≤ CapH s,1 (·) ≈ Λ(∞)

(iv) CapW s,1 (·) is countably subadditive, but CapH s,1 (·) and CapH±s,1 (·) may not be countably
subadditive.
Proof. Both (i) and (ii) follow from (3.1).
(iii) First, according to Definition 3.1, we only need to consider these capacities on compact
sets. For any u ∈ S, by (1.4), we get
[u]H±s,1 ≤ [u]H s,1 . [u]W s,1 ⇒ Cap H±s,1 (·) ≤ CapH s,1 (·) . CapW s,1 (·).
Noting that
CapW s,1 (·) ≈ Λn−s

R s (K) = inf k f kH 1 : f ∈ S∞ & Is f ≥ 1 on K

satisfies

Λn−s
(∞) (K) ≈ R s (K).
By Lemma 2.10, we have
S∞ ⊂ S s,0 ⊂ H 1
and the density of S s,0 in H 1 . Meanwhile, for any ( f, x) ∈ S s,0 × Rn , it is obvious that Is f (x) is
well defined and Is f is continuous on Rn . Thus, instead of using S∞ , we have
o
n
R s (K) = inf k f kH 1 : f ∈ S s,0 & Is f ≥ 1 on K .

INTRINSIC NATURE OF THE STEIN-WEISS H 1 -INEQUALITY

21

For any u ∈ S satisfying u ≥ 1 on K let
s

f∗ = (−∆) 2 u,
which belongs to S s,0 in terms of Lemma 2.10. Then, by Lemma 2.3 we have
Is f∗ = u ≥ 1 on K,
thereby achieving
s

R s (K) ≤ k f∗ kH 1 = k(−∆) 2 ukH 1 = [u]H s,1 .
Taking the infimum over all such u ∈ S satisfying u ≥ 1 on K yields

R s (K) ≤ inf [u]H s,1 : S ∋ u ≥ 1 on K = Cap H s,1 (K).

Thus,

Λn−s
(∞) (K) . Cap H s,1 (K).
This proves (3.2).
(iv) The countable subadditivity of CapW s,1 (·) follows from [39, Theorem 1(iii)]. Since the
test functions used in

Cap X (·) for X ∈ H s,1 , H±s,1

are not assumed to be nonnegative, the capacities under consideration may not be countably
subadditive as mentioned in [4].

Strong estimates for CapX∈{H s,1 ,H−s,1 (n>1)} . First of all, an application of Proposition 3.2(iii) and
[38, Theorem 1.1] or [23, Theorem 1.3] gives the following strong inequality for CapW s,1 (cf.

∀ u ∈ Cc∞ .

Next, we are led by (3.3) to get the strong inequality for CapH s,1 as seen below.
Theorem 3.3. If s ∈ (0, 1), then
Z ∞

CapH s,1 {x ∈ Rn : |u(x)| > t} dt . [u]H s,1

Proof. Note that Proposition 3.2(iii) implies

Let v = t−1 u. Then

Accordingly, by definition we have

which implies

CapH±s,1 {x ∈ Rn : u(x) > t} < t−1 [u]H±s,1 + ǫ.

Motivated by the argument in [6, p. 399], we consider the bounded linear operator
A+ : H̊+s,1 → L1
s

u 7→ (−∆) 2 u
which is actually a closed operator thanks to the definition of H̊+s,1 based on the completeness
of S in H+s,1 . If
s
u ∈ H̊+s,1 obeys k(−∆) 2 ukL1 = 0,
then
s
(−∆) 2 u = 0 almost everywhere on Rn ,
which implies
s

s

hu, φi = hu, (−∆) 2 Is φi = h(−∆) 2 u, Is φi = 0

∀ φ ∈ S∞ ,

that is, u = 0 in S′ /P, or equivalently, u is a polynomial on Rn . Further, any u ∈ S′s being a
polynomial forces u to be a constant function on Rn . In other words, it holds u = 0 in H̊+s,1 .
Thus, the operator A+ is injective. In the meantime, A+ enjoys
s

kA+ ukL1 = k(−∆) 2 ukL1 = kukH+s,1

∀ u ∈ H̊+s,1 .

Consequently, A+ has a continuous inverse from L1 to H̊+s,1 . Since the definition of H̊+s,1 (determined by the closure of S in H+s,1 ) ensures that
A+ : H̊+s,1 → L1
is a closed linear operator, the closed range theorem (see [40, p. 208, Corollary 1]) derives that
the transpose of A+
A∗+ : L∞ → [H̊+s,1 ]∗ ,
defined by
hA∗+ F, ui = hF, A+ ui ∀ F~ ∈ L∞ & u ∈ H̊+s,1 ,
is surjective. In particular, since
T ∈ [H̊+s,1 ]∗ ,
we can find
U0 ∈ L∞ such that A∗+ U0 = T.
Consequently, for any u ∈ S, we have
s

hA∗+ U0 , ui = hU0 , A+ ui = hU0 , A+ ui = hU0 , (−∆) 2 ui = h[∇+s ]∗ U0 , ui,
whence gives
T = A∗+ U0 = [∇+s ]∗ U0 in S′ .
(iv) Let T ∈ S′ . If

This shows that u = 0 in S /P. In other words, u is a polynomial on Rn . However, if a
polynomial u is a bounded linear functional on S s , then u must be a constant function,
which implies that u = 0 in H̊−s,1 . In other words,
A− : H̊−s,1 → (L1 )n
is injective.
⊲ This last injectiveness and the next identification
kA− uk(L1 )n = k∇−s ukL1 = kukH−s,1

∀ u ∈ H̊−s,1 .

derive that
A− : H̊−s,1 → R(A− ) = A− (H̊−s,1 )
has a continuous inverse sending R(A− ) to H̊−s,1 .
⊲ Clearly, the closure of S in H−s,1 ensures that R(A− ) is closed in (L1 )n . So, from the
