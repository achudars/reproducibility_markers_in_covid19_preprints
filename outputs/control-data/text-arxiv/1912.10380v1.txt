The Black-Scholes-Merton Dual Equation

Abstract: We derive the Black-Scholes-Merton dual equation, which has exactly the same form
as the Black-Scholes-Merton equation. The new equation is general and works for European,
American, Bermudan, Asian, barrier, lookback, etc. options and leads to new insights into pricing
and hedging. Trivially, a put-call equality emerges − all the above-mentioned put (call) options
can be priced as their corresponding calls (puts) by simply swapping stock price (dividend yield)
for strike price (risk-free rate) simultaneously; equally important, deltas (gammas) of such
options are linked via analytic formulas. As one application in hedging, the dual equation is
utilized to improve the accuracy of the recently proposed approach of hedging options statically
with short-maturity contracts.
Key words: Black-Scholes-Merton dual equation; put-call equality; payoffs of homogeneous of
degree one; static hedge with short-maturity options; hedge accuracy.

In his groundbreaking paper, Merton (1973) elegantly proves that call prices of American options
are homogeneous of degree one. 1 The price homogeneity of derivatives turns out to be quite
general for scale-invariant underlying processes, and the prices of many well-known options,
such as Bermudan, Asian, and barrier, are actually homogeneous of degree one (Alexander and
Nogueira, 2006).
Utilizing the price homogeneity and the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) differential equation
(Black and Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1973), 2 we derive a second-order partial differential equation
with respect to the option’s strike as the fundamental variable. Interestingly, this new equation
has exactly the same form as the celebrated BSM equation, but with the strike price replacing the
underlying price and the risk-free interest rate switching places with the dividend yield. Due to
the “symmetry” between the new equation and the BSM equation, we will refer to this new
equation as the Black-Scholes-Merton dual equation.
Conspicuously, the BSM dual equation is very general. Because the option’s price preserves
the homogeneity of its payoff (Alexander and Nogueira, 2006), the BSM dual equation works for
any option with a payoff of homogeneous of degree one. Such options include, but are not
limited to, European, American, Bermudan, Asian, barrier, and lookback.
The BSM dual equation has intriguing implications for the pricing of complex options. We

prove that the price of put options is equal to that of call options via the dual equation, and vice
versa. Actually, the put-call equality is accomplished by simply swapping stock price (dividend
yield) for strike price (risk-free rate) simultaneously, which is readily verifiable for European
options via the BSM formulas and for American options via binomial-trees. This put-call
equality is more general than the classic put-call parity, which is valid solely for European
options. Equally important, the delta of put options is a simple analytic function of that of call
options, so is gamma, and vice versa.
The put-call equality leads to further new insights on pricing, among which we show two. It
is generally believed that unlike American calls, American puts can only be priced numerically.
We show convincingly that American currency puts can be approximated quite well by the
Black-Scholes-Merton put formula, if the foreign risk-free rate is higher than the domestic
risk-free rate. In the limit of a zero domestic risk-free rate, the BSM put formula becomes the
exact price for American currency puts.
Another insight concerns the issue of known dollar dividends in pricing European options.
Hull’s popular textbook (2015) makes use of the risky component of the stock process. We argue
that under the put-call equality the risky component approach is incorrect for American calls.
Therefore, the textbook approach to dollar dividends for European options pricing is probably
problematic.

No less fascinatingly, the BSM dual equation also has potential applications in options’
hedging, a representative example of which is shown by us. Wu and Zhu (2016) recently
proposed an ingenious scheme of hedging an option statically with a portfolio of options with
shorter maturities. In terms of hedge accuracy, we show that the Wu-Zhu scheme can be
improved upon by utilizing the dual equation. The improvement is confirmed by extensive
numerical analyses.
We contribute to the derivatives’ literature in three ways. First, the BSM dual equation,
which complements the BSM equation, is perhaps the last piece to complete the
Black-Scholes-Merton framework. Second, the BSM dual equation and the put-call equality
provide new perspectives on and innovative approaches to options’ pricing, and is shown to shed
light on several complex issues in options’ pricing and hedging. Third, the put-call equality leads
to simpler and possibly more efficient implementations of options’ pricing for real-world
practical applications.
Note that the BSM dual equation is not the only second-order partial differential equation
with respect to the option’s strike. Widely used as local volatility models, the Dupire equation
(1993) and its improved version (Gatheral, 2002) also utilize the strike price as the fundamental
variable. 3 Important differences remain, however. Unlike our general dual equation, the
3

According to Breeden and Litzenberger (1978), the risk-neutral probability density at an option’s maturity is a

linear function of the second-order partial derivative of the price of a European call with respect to its strike. This

3

(improved) Dupire equation is not scale-invariant (Alexander and Nogueira, 2006) and in
principle works only for European options at maturity.
Also, relationships between puts and calls exist in the literature. Andreasen and Carr (2002)
provide an excellent review of various ways of relating puts to calls, such as put-call equivalence
(Grabbe, 1983; Detemple 1999; Schroder, 1999), put-call symmetry (Bates, 1988), and put-call
duality (Andreasen, 1997; Haug, 2002; Peskir and Shiryaev, 2002). Among those, the “dual
economy” in Andreasen (1997) is closest to ours, but “time is reversed” in that economy. All
those previous discussions are limited only to European and perhaps American options, but our
put-call equality generalizes the existing results and is also applicable to other options, such as
Bermudan, Asian, barrier, and lookback. Our approach stands out in other aspects, too. The proof
of the put-call equality, which seems ingenious and mathematically simplest, is undoubtedly
unique. Operationally, the application of the put-call equality is the simplest. Finally, it appears
that only our dual reasoning leads to additional insights into issues concerning options’ pricing.
The remaining part of the paper is outlined here. Section I derives the Black-Scholes-Merton
dual equation for options with payoffs of homogenous of degree one, and discusses its economic
implications. Next, we discuss the put-call equality, a new insight from the BSM dual equation,
and several issues on options’ pricing in Section II. In Section III, an application of the BSM

relationship is utilized to derive both the Dupire equation and its improved version.

dual equation in options’ hedging, concerning the improvement of the Wu and Zhu (2016) hedge
scheme, is considered in details. Finally, we conclude with remarks.
I. The Black-Scholes-Merton Dual Equation
Wu and Zhu (2016) proposed the ingenious scheme of hedging an option statically with a
portfolio of options of the same kind but of shorter terms of maturities. The weights of the
hedging options are determined by matching payoffs at the end of the hedging period via the
approximate Dupire equation (1993). Researching on an improvement of the Wu-Zhu scheme,
we serendipitously stumble onto the “symmetric” twin form of the celebrated
Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) equation. 4 To the best of our knowledge, the BSM twin form
seems to have not been discussed by previous literature. This new twin form is presented in
Proposition 1.
PROPOSITION 1: Under the Black-Scholes-Merton framework, the price of any option with a
payoff of homogeneous of degree one satisfies the following Black-Scholes-Merton dual
equation:

∂v
∂v 1 2 2 ∂ 2v
+ (q − r ) K
+ σ K
= qv

where v is the option price, q is the continuous dividend yield, r is the risk-free interest rate, K is

Loosely, we use the term “BSM equation” to refer to the generalized equation with a continuous dividend yield or

for a foreign currency (Garman and Kohlhagen, 1983).

the strike price, and σ is the volatility.
PROOF: According to Alexander and Nogueira (2006), the price of options preserves the
homogeneity of their payoffs, given a scale-invariant underlying process. Further, the
well-known geometric Brownian motion (GBM) under the BSM framework is scale-invariant.
Therefore, the prices of options with a payoff of homogeneous of degree one are homogeneous
of degree one under BSM, too.
Denote the prices of such options by v( St ,K), where St is the underlying price and K is the
strike price. According to Euler’s homogeneous function theorem, we have:

v = St

Furthermore, it is not difficult to show (see Appendix I) that:

⑶.

Combining Equations (2-3) with the Black-Scholes-Merton equation (with a constant dividend
yield), we obtain Equation (1). QED.
One can readily see that Equation (1) has exactly the same form as the BSM differential
equation with a continuous dividend yield (Black and Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1973), but with K
substituting St and r switching places with q. For this reason, it is called the
Black-Scholes-Merton dual equation in Proposition 1. Note that the derivation is independent of

6

q, r, and/or σ , so Equation (1) is not limited to these three parameters being constant.
Note that Equation (1) is quite general. The dual equation works for a broad class of
well-known options under BSM, such as European, American, Bermudan, barrier, and Asian,
because their payoffs (and thus prices) are homogeneous of degree one (Alexander and Nogueira,
2006).
Intuitively, Equation (1) is not difficult to understand for two simple reasons. First, the
payoff, max(ST − K ,0) , of a call option is also the payoff of a put option on the “underlying”
price K with a “strike” ST . This can be elaborated in the following way. Imagine that one stands
on and moves with the underlying price at maturity. The underlying price would appear to be
fixed while the strike price would seem to be varying. As a result, the call option written on the
underlying would appear to be a put option written on the (varying) strike, which can be viewed
as a risk-free “bond” with price K. In such a world, the underlying share is the numeraire or the
unit of measure. 5 Measured in shares, q represents additional “shares” or would be the “risk-free
interest rate”, and r stands for the “interest rate income” provided by the “underlying bond” or
would be the “continuous dividend yield.” Second, it is true of course that the
Black-Scholes-Merton equation works for both calls and puts. Therefore, the price of “the put
written on the bond” would also satisfy the BSM equation. With K as the underlying price, q as
5

The BSM dual equation (1) is not a result of simply changing the numeraire though, because in changes of

numeraire, the strike is still treated as a constant (see for example, Schroder, 1999).

7

the risk-free interest rate, and r as the continuous dividend yield, that “Black-Scholes-Merton
equation” would be nothing but the dual Equation (1).
Further, the Black-Scholes-Merton formulas provide special cases for the above reasoning.
In the price formulas of European options with a continuous dividend yield, the symmetry
between St (q) and K (r) is doubtlessly obvious. Therefore, it will not change the mathematical
characteristics of the formulas by swapping St (q) for K (r) simultaneously. The new formulas
would be prices for options written on K, with a strike price St , a “risk-free interest rate” q, and a
“continuous dividend yield” r. Then mathematically, the formulas after swapping have to be the
solutions of the dual Equation (1).
II. The Put-call Equality
The dual nature of Equation (1) with respect to the BSM equation has intriguing implications for
options’ pricing. The results for a general put and its corresponding call in the world of the BSM
dual equation are proved and summarized as follows.
PROPOSITION 2: Let refer to the original BSM world as the BSM space. Further, the BSM
dual equation world is named the dual space, in which the strike price is treated as the
“underlying” variable and the current stock price is assumed to be the “strike”, while the roles of
r and q are switched. Further, dual calls (puts) are used to mean call (put) options in the dual
space. For options with payoffs that are homogenous of degree one (i.e., consisting with

8

Proposition 1), denote the call prices by VC ( S 0 , r ; K , q ) and put by VP ( S 0 , r ; K , q ) , in which the
positions of the variables are significant and sequentially denote stock price, risk-free rate, strike
price, and dividend yield:
(a) The price of a put VP ( S0 , r ; K , q) is equal to the price of its corresponding dual call

VC~ ( K , q; S0 , r ) . Note that we use ~ on top of the C (or P) to indicate the dual space;
(b) The delta of a put ∂VP ∂S0 is equal to (VC~ − K∆) S0 , where ∆ = ∂VC~ ∂K is the delta of the
corresponding dual call. S 0 and K stand for stock price and strike price defined in the BSM space,
respectively;
(c) The gamma of a put ∂ 2VP ∂S02 is equal to K 2Γ S02 , where Γ = ∂ 2VC~ ∂K 2 is the gamma of
the corresponding dual call. S 0 and K stand for stock price and strike price defined in the BSM
space, respectively. 6
PROOF: (a) According to Proposition 1, the price of a put VP ( S0 , r ; K , q ) solves both the BSM
equation and Equation (1). As a solution of the dual equation though, VP is also the price of a call
with underlying variable K, strike S 0 , risk-free rate q, and dividend yield r, and is thus nothing
but VC~ ( K , q; S 0 , r ) by definition. To conclude, VP = VC~ .
(b) From (a), we have ∂VP ∂K = ∂VC~ ∂K . Combining with Equation (2), we obtain the result for

With delta and gamma, we have a complete story for pricing and hedging. Undoubtedly, delta and gamma are two

of the most important and useful Greeks. According to Chatterjea and Jarrow (2012), they are also the only valid
Greeks.

9

the put delta.
(c) From (b), we have ∂ 2VP ∂K 2 = ∂ 2VC~ ∂K 2 . Utilizing Equation (3), we obtain the result for the
put gamma. QED.
The interpretation of Proposition (2.a) is actually very simple; trivially, any put can be priced
as its corresponding call by simply swapping stock price (dividend yield) for strike price
(risk-free rate) simultaneously. For example, a put with stock price 40, strike 50, risk-free rate
6%, and without dividends can be priced as a call with stock price 50, strike 40, risk-free rate 0%,
and dividend yield 6%, or VP (40,6%;50,0) = VC~ (50,0;40,6%) in mathematical notations. This will
be easily seen later in Table I for American options.
Apparently, the above proof is also correct for any call and its corresponding dual put. With
Proposition 2, it is clear that the price, delta, and gamma of a put (call) can be obtained from
those of a call (put) in the dual space. This provides a new approach for understanding and
pricing options, which is referred to as the put-call equality, and can be truly useful when the
pricing in the BSM space seems to be challenging (see Sections II.C and II.D below).
Importantly, the proposition is very general and works for a broad class of options with payoffs
of homogeneous of degree one.
Furthermore, Proposition 2 or the put-call equality has appealing implications for the
implementation of options’ pricing methods. In principle, only one type of options, either calls or

10

puts, is necessary to be implemented in computer coding. If the call pricing is implemented, puts
can then be priced via the same program by simply swapping stock price (dividend yield) for
strike price (risk-free rate) simultaneously, and vice versa. This leads to simple and clean, small
and efficient implementations of pricing algorithms in real-world applications.
For illustration, the put-call equality is verified in the following for European options via the
Black-Scholes-Merton formulas and numerically for American options. Further, the put-call
equality is utilized to shed light on the complex issues of pricing certain American puts and
known dollar dividends in options’ pricing.
A. European Options
Denote the European call (put) price by c (p). The well-known Black-Scholes-Merton put
formula is:
p( S0 , r ; K , q) = Ke- rT N (−d 2 ) − S0e- qT N (−d1 )
d1 =

ln(S0 K ) + (r − q + 0.5σ 2 )T
, d 2 = d1 − σ T
σ T

Because the BSM dual equation has exactly the same form as the BSM equation, the dual
call price that solves the BSM dual equation must have the same form as the BSM call formula
in the BSM space, but with S 0 (r) switching places with K (q). Therefore, the corresponding dual
call price is as follows:
c~ ( K , q; S 0 , r ) = Ke - rT N (d1* ) − S 0e - qT N (d 2* )

11

d1* =

ln( K S0 ) + (q − r + 0.5σ 2 )T *
, d 2 = d1* − σ T
σ T

Trivially d1* = −d 2 and d 2* = −d1 . Therefore, c~ = p . Similarly, the corresponding dual put price can
be shown to be the same as the call price.
Further, it is trivial to show that the call delta in the dual space is e- rT N (d1* ) . Applying
Proposition (2.b), we obtain the put delta as e - qT N (d 2* ) , which is nothing but the well-known put
delta e- qT N (−d 1) in the BSM space. Similarly, Proposition (2.c) can be verified.
Of course, the European call and put are related via the well-known put-call parity (Black
and Scholes, 1973), so the put-call equality may seem to be unnecessary for European options.
Nevertheless, the put-call equality, which also works for American and many other options,
provides an alternative to and is significantly more general than the put-call parity.
B. American Equity Options
For American options when early-exercise can be optimal, the put-call equality can only be
verified via numerical examples. The numerical parameters utilized in this section are assumed
as follows. The risk-free rate is 6%, the volatility is 40%, and the maturity of options is 365 days.
The numerical pricing is carried out via binomial tree with daily steps here. Note that even
though the chosen numerical values in this section are quite limited, the conclusions are
nevertheless valid in general.
It is well-known that when the underlying stock does not pay any dividend, an American

12

equity call should never be exercised early (Merton, 1973), and thus can be priced by the
Black-Scholes-Merton call formula. Further, the premium of early-exercising can usually be
ignored approximately (see a heuristic argument in Appendix II). On the other hand, it may be
optimal to exercise an American put before maturity. Therefore, it is only necessary to verify
Proposition 2 for American puts. Table I shows clearly that American puts can be priced as
American calls in the dual space with negligible errors.
Table I here
In addition, the delta and gamma of an American put option can be computed accurately
from the delta and gamma of its corresponding dual call, respectively. Most of the corresponding
deltas match to four digits after the decimal point, so do gammas (Table II).
Table II here
C. American Currency Puts
Ever since Merton (1973), it has been believed that American puts can only be priced
numerically. The put-call equality leads to new insights on American currency puts, however. If
the domestic risk-free rate were zero, the corresponding dual call of the American put would be
equivalent to an American equity call without dividends, and thus not be exercised early at all.
Applying the dual pricing reasoning again but in reverse, we know that this dual call has the
same price as its corresponding European put in the BSM space. Therefore, the American

13

currency put with a zero domestic risk-free rate can then be priced exactly by the BSM put
formula. 7 This is certainly more accurate than numerical approaches, all of which are
unfortunately prone to numerical errors.
One might argue that risk-free interest rates are rarely zero. Still, it is not uncommon for
r < rf . In this case, the early-exercising premium of an American put can be negligible, as the
put-call equality reveals once more. In other words, American puts with r < rf can be priced
approximately by the BSM put formula.
The above analyses for American puts are easily confirmed numerically (Table III). When
the domestic risk-free rate is zero, the prices of American puts and their corresponding European
puts are almost the same, provided that numerical errors exist in the binomial-tree pricing of
American puts. With a domestic risk-free rate of 3%, which is one half of the foreign risk-free
rate, the absolute pricing errors of the BSM put formula for the American puts are all below 0.1%
and still truly small. Finally with a domestic risk-free rate as high as 5%, the biggest absolute
error is nevertheless under 1% and perhaps well acceptable in practice.
Table III here
D. Known Dollar Dividends
The issue of known dollar dividends in options’ pricing is complicated and seems to be still an
7

The “BSM formulas” here loosely refer to pricing formulas for European currency options in Garman and

Kohlhagen (1983).

14

open question. In the popular textbook of Hull (2015), European options are priced by applying
the BSM formulas to the risky component of the stock process. With the notation used in Section
II.A, the price of a European call is then c( S0 − D, r ; K ,0) , where D is the present value of dollar
dividends, and the parameter 0 indicates a zero dividend yield or without dividends. Obviously,
the risky component of the stock process is modeled as GBM (and thus scale-invariant), and the
BSM formula c( S 0 − D, r ; K ,0) is homogenous of degree one with respect to S 0 − D and K, and is a
solution of the dual equation. Note that Hull (2015) states explicitly that this approach has been
criticized by some recent literature (for example, Areal and Rodrigues, 2013).
Remarkably, whether the Hull (2015) approach is legitimate can be analyzed via the put-call
equality. If we follow the Hull approach for American calls, the American price is then

C ( S0 − D, r ; K ,0) . Even though it is perhaps unclear how to handle early exercise for calls here,
the corresponding put in the dual space turns out to be easier to analyze. The price of the dual

~
American put is simply P ( K ,0; S 0 − D, r ) , where the underlying variable K represents again the
risky component. Since S 0 − D is now the strike (and a constant), D is absent from the underlying
process of the risky component, and the “risk-free rate” is zero, the dual put will not be exercised

~
early (see Section II.C above). Therefore, P is equal to the price of the dual European put.
Because the price of the dual European put is the same as c( S0 − D, r ; K ,0) , we have

C ( S0 − D, r ; K ,0) = c( S0 − D, r ; K ,0) . In other words, the American call would have the same

15

price as the corresponding European call under the Hull (2015) approach. On the other hand, it is
known that it can be optimal to exercise the call right before the dividend payment (Merton,
1973). Therefore, we have a contradiction here. This implies that the assumption of the risky
component is problematic. To conclude, the textbook treatment of dollar dividends for European
options is probably problematic.
A moment of reflection will confirm this unfortunate conclusion. Indeed, if one works only
with the risky component of the stock process, there is no place for any known dividend; the
present value of the dividend can only go with the initial stock price. On the other hand, the risky
component of the stock process should be independent of and indifferent to the type of the option,
be it European or American. In other words, the risky component of the stock process should
work in the same way for both European and American options. Without any mechanism for
early-exercising, an American call thus has to be the same as its corresponding European call.
In summary, the implication of the put-call equality on options’ pricing is very innovative
and insightful. Further, the put-call equality leads to an efficient evaluation via the BSM put
formula for American currency puts, when the foreign risk-free rate is higher. Finally, a new
understanding can be gained on Hull’s textbook approach to known dividends in pricing
European options, as the above dual pricing analyses reveal.
III. Improved Wu-Zhu Static Hedge

16

In this section, we discuss another possible application of the BSM dual equation. Theoretically,
the risk of options can only be perfectly hedged dynamically (Black and Scholes, 1973; Merton,
1973). Alternatively, options can be approximately hedged statically, which might be preferred in
practice for its simplicity of implementation. Static hedge is more or less based on matching
payoffs, an idea first suggested by Breeden and Litzenberger (1978). For nonlinear payoffs, a
scheme of static hedge was first proposed by Derman et al. (1995) and later improved upon with
optimizations by Liu (2010). Hedging barrier options by standard options was discussed by Carr
and Chou (1997). For piecewise linear payoffs, Wu and Zhu (2016) recently proposed an
ingenious approach of static hedge, built on Carr and Wu (2014), by using a portfolio of
contracts with shorter maturities.
The Wu-Zhu scheme of matching payoffs depends critically on the Dupire equation (1993):

∂c 1 2 2 ∂ 2c
= σ K
∂T 2
∂K 2
for eliminating the terms of the second-order partial derivative with respect to the option’s strike.
With both the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield being zero, the Dupire equation is
only an approximation, however. Therefore, the hedge can in principle be made more meaningful
economically and accurate numerically by including both the risk-free rate and the dividend
yield.
Fortunately, this can be achieved by utilizing the BSM dual equation. Substituting ∂ ∂t by

17

− ∂ ∂T in Equation (1), we obtain the following:

which does contain both the risk-free rate and the dividend yield. Incidentally, Equation (2)
seems to be the same as the improved Dupire equation (Gatheral, 2002). 8 Still, there are crucial
differences between the BSM dual equation and the improved Dupire equation. While the former
is very general, the latter appears to work only for European options at maturity (see Footnote 3).
A. BSM-Dual Hedge Scheme
Applying Equation (2), we can now improve the hedge accuracy of the Wu-Zhu scheme. To
make it more general, we introduce a hedge period, which ends before the maturity of any of the
hedging options, to the hedge scheme. The improved hedge weights of Wu-Zhu are summarized
in Proposition 3, the derivation of which can be found in Appendix III.
PROPOSITION 3: An option with strike K and maturity T can be hedged statically for a short
period of T h . Assume that options are available with the following (strike, maturity) pairs: (K u ,
T o ), (K d , T o ), and (K c , T c ), where K d < K < K u , K d < K c < K u , Th < min(To , Tc ) , and

max(To , Tc ) < T . A static replication is possible by a portfolio of three options with the following
weights ( wx , x = d , u , c ), as a result of Taylor expansions of the prices of options around ( K , Th ) :

8

Equation (4) in Gatheral (2002) is incorrect for having an extra rc term, which can be confirmed by a different

derivation that follows primarily the original Dupire (1993) derivation.

It is not difficult to verify that Equation (5) reduces to Equation (4) of Wu and Zhu (2016),
when both r and q are set to zero and Th = To . Therefore, Equation (5) is more general and
probably more accurate too. For brevity, the new hedge scheme via Equation (5) will be called
the BSM-dual hedge scheme hereafter.
Further, note that T c is allowed to be shorter than T o in Wu and Zhu (2016). This might be
problematic or leads to large errors, because at or after the maturity the partial derivative with
respect to T may be ill-defined. Certainly, it makes more sense for a hedge to end before any of
the hedging options expires. Therefore, the hedge period in Proposition 3 is required and set to
be shorter than all the maturities of the hedging options.
It is worth noting that BSM-dual hedge scheme is in principle applicable to all the options
with payoffs of homogeneous of degree one, due to the dual equation (1). Therefore, it is more

19

general than the original Wu-Zhu hedge scheme.
B. Hedge Performance under BSM
The weights of the BSM-dual hedge via Equation (5), as well as the original Wu-Zhu hedge, are
functions of the local volatility σ ( K , Th ) at the future time T h . Consequently, both hedge schemes
at the time of the hedge setup have to know the currently unknown future volatility, or rely upon
the implicit assumption of deterministic volatilities.
Even though the Heston stochastic volatility or/and jumps in the underlying price are
included in the simulation analyses of Wu and Zhu (2016), how the future local volatility is
determined under those circumstances appears not to be discussed. For example, it is even
unclear how σ ( K , Th ) should be forecasted at the time of the hedge setup under the Heston model
(Heston, 1993). This issue may be worthy of research in a future project.
Fortunately, the volatility is either constant or deterministic under the Black-Scholes-Merton
framework. Accordingly, the hedge weights in Equation (5) can be computed readily without any
possible ambiguity. Further, prices of European options can trivially be obtained via the BSM
formulas. Therefore, we focus on analyzing the hedge performance under Black-Scholes-Merton
in the remaining part of this section.
B.1. Parameter Sets
Since the parameter space for options is infinite, the numerical values are chosen and limited to

20

the following for illustration purposes. Assume first, as is typically done, that the risk-free
interest rate, volatility, and dividend yield are 5%, 20%, and 1% per annum, respectively.
Suppose that the strike and maturity of the call option being hedged are 50 and 0.5 years (or
6 months). The strike spacing and maturity of the hedging call options can then be chosen with
practical considerations. Around 50, the strikes for the hedging calls can be between 35 and 65
with a strike spacing of 5. Typically, the front (or nearby) month contract expires in about one
month, and the next month contract has a maturity of roughly two months. 9 For easy exposition
then, these shorter terms of maturity are set to be 1 month (or 1 12 years) and 2 months (or 2 12
years), respectively. Finally, the hedge period will end five days before the front month contract
expires (i.e. Th = 1 12 − 5 365 years), in order to avoid extreme price volatility when the option is
very close to maturity.
Our unreported analysis shows that when K c ≠ K the corresponding hedge errors turn out to
be quite large. This is also mentioned in Wu and Zhu (2016). Thus, the remaining analyses will
focus exclusively on K c = K . For the pair ( K d , K u ) , (40,60) yields overall the smallest errors
among the nine possible combinations, namely (35,55), (35,60), (35,65), (40,55), (40,60),
(40,65), (45,55), (45,60), and (45,65). With the pair (40,60), one can further choose among three
possibilities, namely two front month contracts and one next month contract, three front month
9

A contract with the shortest maturity is called the front, spot, or nearby month contract, and the next month

contract expires one month after the front month contract does.

21

contracts, or one front month contract and two next month contracts. The first case,

(To , Tc ) = (1 12 , 2 12) , out of the three possibilities appears to be the best. 10 Those observations
confirm more or less the results reported in Wu and Zhu (2016).
B.2. Gross Hedge Error
Now let focus on the best case, namely ( K d , K c , K u ) = (40,50,60) and (To , Tc ) = (1 12 , 2 12) , and
compare with Wu and Zhu (2016). From Equation (5), the BSM-dual weights, ( wd , wc , wu ) , are
(0.2184,0.6323,0.1456), while the Wu-Zhu weights are (0.1818,0.6364,0.1818). 11 Obviously,
even though the values of the risk-free rate and dividend yield are small, their effects on the
weights are not insignificant.
Given the underlying price at Th , the gross hedge error ε h can be computed directly under
Black-Scholes:

ε h = wd c( K d , To ;Th ) + wc c( K c , Tc ;Th ) + wu c( K u , To ;Th ) − c( K , T ;Th )

⑹.

where c( K , T ; Th ) is the BSM call price formula at time Th (or the end of the hedge) with strike K
and maturity T − Th . The three other price symbols in Equation (4) can be similarly interpreted.
Of course, this definition is given by Wu and Zhu (2016), and its application is not limited only
to Black-Scholes-Merton.
The gross hedge errors for stock prices between 35 and 85 are reported in Table IV. The
10

There are 81 possible combinations of strikes and maturities.

11

The hedge period is the maturity of the front month contract for the Wu-Zhu weights.

22

absolute values of the hedge errors under BSM-dual are quite small for a wide range of stock
prices, with the maximum of 0.218 for the stock price 45. On the other hand, the absolute values
of the hedge errors from Wu-Zhu are comparatively much larger, with the largest at 0.779 for the
stock price 60.
Table IV here
Even though the absolute values of the errors are tiny for out-of-the-money calls, these
errors as a percentage of the hedged call price are not small at all. Indeed, the percentage hedge
error for the stock price 35 is as big as -100%. Therefore, the percentage error, defined as the
ratio of ε h and c( K , T ; Th ) , would be a more meaningful gauge of the hedge performance. For the
BSM-dual hedge, the absolute percentage errors are all under 1% when the call is at-the-money
(ATM) or in-the-money ITM. On the other hand, all the absolute percentage errors from Wu-Zhu
are above 1% and much larger. Viewed via percentage hedge errors, the outperformance of
BSM-dual becomes truly remarkable. Unfortunately, percentage hedge errors are not reported by
Wu and Zhu (2016).
B.3. True Hedge Error
Actually, the hedge error ε h from Equation (4) may be inaccurate, because Equation (4) deals
only with time Th . An accurate and correct measure should take the setup of the hedge into
consideration, unless the initial replication is perfect. Let’s define the net cost of hedge as

23

follows:

x = wd c( K d , To ) + wc c( K c , Tc ) + wu c( K u , To ) − c( K , T )

⑺.

where c( K , T ) is the BSM option price at time 0 (i.e., the beginning of the hedge period). x is
simply the value of the hedging portfolio minus the price of the hedged option at the time of the
hedge setup.
It turns out that the net hedge cost is not zero from either BSM-dual or Wu-Zhu (Table V).
While the highest cost from BSM-dual is only 0.151, most of the absolute costs from Wu-Zhu
are many times higher. Similarly, the absolute value of the net cost is very close to the price of
the hedged call, when the initial stock price is 35. As a result, the (setup) error is around -90%.
Note that the setup hedge cost is another issue that is overlooked by Wu and Zhu (2016).
Table V here
If the net hedge cost is positive, the hedging has to be financed by a loan that needs to be
repaid at the end of the hedge. Otherwise, the hedging will be covered completely by the sales of
the option being hedged (and possibly with an extra cash amount to be deposited in a bank).
Thus, the true hedge error eh has to take the net cost of hedge into consideration, by deducting the
future value of the net hedge cost from the gross hedge error ε h :

eh = ε h − x exp(rTh )

⑻.

Using the gross hedge errors from Table IV and the net costs of hedge from Table V, one can

24

estimate the true hedge error for any pair of the initial underlying price at time 0 and the final
underlying price at time Th . The price pair can be viewed as representing a possible price path.
Because both Tables IV and V contain 11 prices, the number of price paths -- amounting to 121
-- is too many to show here. Consequently, Table VI shows only the most relevant nine paths.
Table VI here
As expected, the BSM-dual hedge outperforms Wu-Zhu. The percentage errors for the initial
price of 45, or when the call option is out-of-the-money, are quite large. With errors as large as
60% or even lower at 38%, the Wu-Zhu scheme is highly unacceptable. Therefore, the extension
to the BSM-dual hedge is certainly worthwhile.
B.4. Simulated Hedge Errors
Obviously, the results in Table VI are rather contrived, even if the true hedge error does depend
on the underlying price at the end of the hedge as well as the underlying price at the beginning of
the hedge. Of course, the end-of-hedge price is not known at the time of the hedge setup.
Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the hedge performance by utilizing Monte-Carlo
simulations.
Simulation Details
Under Black-Scholes-Merton, it is well-known that given an initial price S 0 , the terminal price
can be obtained simply as:

25

STh = S0 exp([ µ − 0.5σ 2 ]Th + σ Th z )
where µ is the rate of return of the underlying, and z is the standard normal random variable.
Again assume ( K d , K c , K u ) = (40,50,60) and (To , Tc ) = (1 12 , 2 12) . Further, all the other
parameter values from section III.B are also used here. µ is set to be r − q in Wu and Zhu (2016).
For robustness, both r − q (or 4%) and the more realistic 8% are considered here. Finally, five
initial stock prices from 46 to 54 are used in simulations, so that a full assessment can be
obtained from two out-of-the-money (OTM) options, one at-the-money (ATM) option, and two
in-the-money (ITM) options. For each initial price, 10,000 terminal prices are simulated by
drawing independently from the standard normal distribution. Note that only the ATM case with
1,000 final prices is analyzed via graphs in Wu and Zhu (2016).
Mean Hedge Errors
Only the root mean square hedge error (RMSE) is used in assessing hedge performance by Wu
and Zhu (2016). As was pointed earlier in Section III.B, the percentage error can be a more
meaningful gauge of the hedge performance than an absolute error. For similar reasons, RMSE
alone is arguably not good enough, either. Therefore, two relative measures, in addition to RMSE,
are used here. As is commonly utilized in the pricing literature, the three measures used are the
mean percentage true hedge error (MHE), the mean absolute percentage true hedge error (MAE),
and RMSE:

26

MHE =

1 J
∑ [eh (STjh ) c( K , T ; Th , STjh ) − 1]
J j =1

MAE =

1 J
eh ( STjh ) c( K , T ;Th , STjh ) − 1
∑
J j =1

RMSE = [

1 J
[eh ( STjh )]2 ]0.5
∑
J j =1

where J is the total number of simulated stock prices at Th (and 10,000 in this Section), eh ( STjh ) is
defined by Equation (6) for stock price STjh , and c( K , T ; Th , STjh ) is the time Th BSM option price
with maturity T − Th and stock price STjh .
Table VII presents the true hedge errors from simulations. In terms of MHE, the BSM-dual
scheme seems to work fine for all the OTM, ATM, and ITM cases, while the corresponding
MHEs from Wu-Zhu are roughly three times large, but nevertheless might be acceptable. With
MAE, the errors from Wu-Zhu for the two OTM calls may well be too big to be practically
useful, but the BSM-dual scheme may be still fine. Across OTM, ATM, and ITM, RMSEs are of
the same magnitude roughly and indistinguishable; the RMSE from Wu-Zhu is at least twice as
large as the corresponding RMSE from BSM-dual, but still seems to be quite small. Finally,
these results are robust to the two choices of µ . In summary, the proposed BSM-dual scheme
outperforms clearly the Wu-Zhu scheme in terms of all three error measures. Therefore, the
proposed generalization of the Wu-Zhu hedge scheme via the Black-Scholes-Merton dual
equation is no doubt well justified.

27

Table VII here
Three insights emerge from Table VII. First, the BSM-dual hedge approach works really
well for and applies to ATM (with MAE under 2.5%) and ITM (with MAE under 1%) options in
practice. Second, RMSE alone does not provide an accurate or clear picture of the hedge
effectiveness. For example, the MAE from BSM-dual for one of the OTM calls is around 7% and
thus may be unsatisfactory, even though the corresponding RMSE is tiny at about 0.07 or seven
cents. Third, the Wu-Zhu hedge is only good enough for the ITM options due to its dependence
on the approximate Dupire equation.
IV. Conclusions
We derive the Black-Scholes-Merton dual equation, a second-order partial differential equation
with respect to the option’s strike price. This new equation is very general and works for
European, American, Bermudan, Asian, barrier, lookback, etc. options.
The BSM dual equation shows important implications for options’ pricing. With the dual
equation, it is easily proved that the price, delta, and gamma of put (call) options are equal to
those of the corresponding call (put) options in the dual space. These equalities are readily
verified for European options via the BSM formulas and for American options via binomial-trees.
Further, the dual nature implies that American currency puts can be valued efficiently by the
BSM formula of the dual call, when the foreign risk-free rate is higher. Finally, the dual

28

argument seems to suggest that the treatment of known dollar dividends in European options’
pricing is problematic in the popular textbook of Hull (2015).
As a remarkable application in options’ hedging, the BSM dual equation is utilized to
improve the hedge accuracy of the static hedge scheme with short-maturity options of Wu and
Zhu (2016). Extensive numerical analyses are carried out to assess the performance of the
proposed BSM-dual hedge scheme. Under Black-Scholes-Merton, the BSM-dual scheme
outperforms significantly the original Wu-Zhu scheme. The absolute percentage errors show that
the new hedge scheme works fine for ITM and ATM options.
Future researches could proceed at least in three directions. First, the dual pricing reasoning
may lead to new insights into the early-exercising boundary for American options. Second, it can
be interesting to extend the dual equation to stochastic volatility and/or stochastic risk-free rate
models. Third, it can be worthwhile to study how the BSM-dual hedge might be applied to
American or barrier options.

APPENDIX
I. Derivation of Equation 3
It is known that the first-order partial derivatives of functions of homogeneous of degree one,
such as v( St ,K), are homogeneous of degree zero:

∂v( βSt , βK ) ∂v( St , K ) ∂v( βSt , βK ) ∂v( St , K )
=

=
∂ ( β St )
∂St
∂ ( βK )

where β is an arbitrary positive real variable. Differentiating both sides of these two equations
with respect to β , and setting β to 1, we obtain Equation (2) as follows:

II. Early Exercise of American Calls
In the binomial tree model, the risk-neutral probability of the underlying price going up is (Hull,
2015):
Q=

exp([r − q ]δ ) − d
u−d

where δ is the time interval, and u (d) are the up (down) parameters. The hold value of American
call is at least: 12

e − rδ [Q( Su − K ) + (1 − Q)( Sd − K )] = Se − qδ − Ke − rδ
≈ ( S − K ) − ( Sq − Kr )δ
Apparently, it is optimal to hold the call if the dividend yield is zero. Further, it is

12

The hold value will accumulate and increase going backwards in time.

30

approximately optimal to hold the call with Sq < Kr . Since q < r usually, only deep in-the-money
American calls will be exercised early. Therefore, the early-exercising premium can be ignored
approximately. On the other hand, the call shall be exercised early if Sq > Kr .
III. Derivation of Proposition 3
The derivation follows mainly Wu and Zhu (2016). Denote the price of an option with strike K
and maturity T by c(K, T). Assume that K d < K < K u , K d < K c < K u , Th < min(To , Tc ) , and

max(To , Tc ) < T . An option can be approximated around ( K , Th ) via Taylor expansions, to
first-order in T and second-order in K:
c( K , T ) = c( K , Th ) +

∂c
(T − Th )
∂T

1 ∂ 2c
∂c
∂c
(Kd − K ) +
( K d − K )2 +
(To − Th )
c( K d , To ) = c( K , Th ) +
2
2 ∂K

∂T
c( K u , To ) = c( K , Th ) +

1 ∂ 2c

c( K c , Tc ) = c( K , Th ) +

1 ∂ 2c
∂c
( Kc − K ) +
( Kc − K )2 +
(Tc − Th )
2
∂K
2 ∂K
∂T

Applying Equation (A3) while substituting ∂ ∂t by − ∂ ∂T , one can eliminate the
second-order partial derivatives with respect to K. Matching the “constant” c( K , Th ) terms gives
the first equation among the three weights ( wx , x = d , u , c ):
(1 + γhd2 ) wd + (1 + γhc2 ) wc + (1 + γhu2 ) wu = 1

where

31

hx =

Kx − K
, x = d , u, c
σ ( K , Th ) K T − Th

and γ = q (T − Th ) . The first-order partial derivatives with respect to K require that:
(hd + βhd2 ) wd + (hc + βhc2 ) wc + (hu + βhu2 ) wu = 0
where β = (r − q ) T − Th σ . The first-order partial derivatives with respect to T yield the final
equation:
(hd2 − α o ) wd + (hc2 − α c ) wc + (hu2 − α o ) wu = 1
where α x = (Th − Tx ) (T − Th ) , x = o, c . In matrix notations, the three equations in the three
weights are written as Equation (5) in Proposition 3. With three linear equations, the three
unknown variables (or weights) can be determined uniquely in closed-form if the determinant of
the 3-by-3 coefficient matrix is non-zero.

Notes: BSM-Dual: hedge weights defined in Equation (3). Wu-Zhu: hedge weights defined in Equation (4) of Wu
and Zhu (2016). The hedge period (T h ) lasts 0.0696 years. The hedged call has strike 50 and maturity 0.5 years. The
hedging calls have (strike, maturity) pairs: (40, 0.0833), (50, 0.1667), and (60, 0.0833). The risk-free rate, volatility,
and dividend yield are 5%, 20%, and 1% per annum, respectively. Calls are priced by the Black-Scholes-Merton
formula. Gross Error: the value of the hedging portfolio minus the price of the hedged call at T h . Gross Error (%):
“Gross Error” as a percentage of the price of the hedged call at T h .
