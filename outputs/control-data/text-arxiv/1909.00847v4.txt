Abstract. Smart sanctions are an increasingly popular tool in foreign
policy. Countries and international institutions worldwide issue such lists
to sanction targeted entities through financial asset freezing, embargoes,
and travel restrictions. The relationships between the issuer and the targeted entities in such lists reflect what kind of entities the issuer intends
to be against. Thus, analyzing the similarities of sets of targeted entities created by several issuers might pave the way toward understanding
the foreign political power structure that influences institutions to take
similar actions. In the current paper, by analyzing the smart sanctions
lists issued by major countries and international institutions worldwide
(a total of 73 countries, 12 international organizations, and 1,700 lists),
we identify the hierarchical structure of influence among these institutions that encourages them to take such actions. The Helmholtz–Hodge
decomposition is a method that decomposes network flow into a hierarchical gradient component and a loop component and is especially suited
for this task. Hence, by performing a Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition
of the influence network of these institutions, as constructed from the
smart sanctions lists they have issued, we show that meaningful insights
about the hierarchical influence structure behind smart sanctions can be
obtained.

Introduction

As globalization progresses, economic trade among nations has been growing at
an increasing rate [11]. There is no doubt that this global expansion of economic
trade contributes to the growth of prosperity in the global economy. Still, the
rising geographical and cultural distances among the participants make it challenging to avoid trading with entities (such as companies and individuals) that
are involved with illegal criminal activities such as money laundering, terrorism,
drug cartels, and human trafficking. To tackle such challenges, governments and
international organizations around the world are increasingly interested in issuing smart sanctions lists, which contain the names of entities involved in such
criminal acts [9, 13].

2

Hisano et al.

However, these lists vary quite substantially, both in the set of entities being banned and the timing of their inclusion, even when the target category
that they aim to ban is the same. This difference stems from several sources.
For instance, some institutions might be vigorous in collecting intelligence that
influences others to follow, whereas other lists might be ignored because of a different understanding of the problem. Some authoritative institutions might have
a higher standard for banning an entity, while others might take actions without much undeniable evidence. It is also possible that an institution is merely
copying the entities added to another, prestigious list to project a sense of international cooperation without actively collecting intelligence themselves [5].
Thus, by analyzing the similarities and differences among such lists, we can shed
some light on the influence network that governs the institutions issuing these
lists. The understanding of such an influence network could enrich our knowledge
of the global political structure.
In this paper, we describe the application of network analysis to the influence
network that governs the major institutions issuing smart sanctions lists. We use
a dataset that includes over 1,700 smart sanctions lists, mainly focused on banning global criminal activities, and perform a Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition
on the network constructed from this dataset. We show that this simple analysis
readily provides meaningful results, which enables a better understanding of the
global political process behind smart sanctions lists.
Many empirical studies measuring the impact of economic sanctions have
restricted their scope to state-level effects, focusing on the period in which a
comprehensive sanction was enacted at the state level [4]. Meanwhile, studies
focused on economic sanctions targeting specific entities such as firms, individuals, and vessels (that is, smart sanctions) are relatively new and less well understood, and studies using firm-level data are scarce [1]. Of the few such studies
to date, [12] undertook an event study and measured the impact of sanctionsrelated news items on the stock market. To the best of our knowledge, no study
has yet focused on analyzing the influence structure among institutions issuing
smart sanctions lists by constructing an influence network from the smart sanctions lists they have released. The current paper opens the door to applying and
developing a new network algorithm to study the foreign power structure in the
global society, which would significantly affect political sciences.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review
the dataset used in this paper. We describe how we construct the influence
network from a set of smart sanctions lists. In Section 3, we briefly explain the
Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition technique used in this paper. In Section 4, we
summarize our results. The final section concludes the paper.

Data

Smart sanctions lists are available online for public use. However, named entity recognition of banned targets, such as companies and individuals, can be a
difficult task because of the variety of ways each institution handles their lists.

Table 1: Ranking of institutions by how many smart sanctions lists they have
issued.

Thus, we resort to information provided from professional sources.4 We use the
smart sanctions list data included in the Dow Jones Adverse Media Entities,
State-Owned Companies, and the Watchlist datasets. The Dow Jones datasets
contain approximately 1,700 smart sanctions lists from 2001 to the present. The
purpose behind these smart sanctions are to curb illegal activities such as money
laundering, drug use, fraud, organized crime, human trafficking, banned air carriers, and terrorist activity.
A total of 85 institutions (such as countries and international organizations)
have issued sanctions lists in our dataset. The top ten institutions, in terms of
the total number of sanctions lists issued, are provided in Table 1. We can see
that the majority are from countries worldwide, but international organizations
such as the EU and the United Nations are also included. The number of smart
sanctions lists issued by each institution varies quite substantially. The average
number of lists issued is 16.7, and the standard deviation is 92.7, which confirms
this insight.
Each entry in a sanctions list comprises the name of the entity sanctioned
and the date of their inclusion, and we can build two types of influence networks
from this dataset. One is the influence network at the smart sanctions list level,
which treats each smart sanctions list as a node. The network is constructed as
follows. For each pair of smart sanctions lists, if list B includes an entity that
is the same as an entity added earlier to list A, we add a weight (that is, 1) to
the edge from A to B. A pair of smart sanctions lists have no connecting edges
if there are no common target entities in the lists. We ignore cases in which two
lists include entities precisely the same date because the direction of influence is
not clear.
We show the result in Fig. 1a. The color of the nodes indicates the major
communities found by standard modularity minimizing algorithms [2, 8]. We see
many isolated nodes (that is, lists) located at the top of community H and be4

low community B. These lists are mainly domestic wanted lists issued by countries that are of little interest to other institutions. Excluding these lists, the
algorithms identified nine major communities. Table 1b summarizes the characteristics of each community. We observe that smart sanctions lists targeting
terrorism are generally located on the left (in community H) close to community
I, which targets Al-Qaeda. On the bottom of the network, there is a community
that targets Libya (community G), and right next to it, we have a community
that deals with Africa in general. Smart sanctions lists dealing with domestic
Japanese issues have, in many cases, nothing in common with foreign lists, which
explains why community A is isolated. However, we can also see several edges
between communities A and B, where B deals with financial crimes. We use these
distinctive communities (the categories of smart sanctions lists) in the following
sections.

Fig. 2: Influence network at institution level using all smart sanctions lists depicted in Fig. 1a.

We can also create an influence network at the country level, and this network
is used to identify the hierarchical influence structure among the institutions behind the smart sanctions. The steps taken are quite similar to those used to
create the influence network at the smart sanctions list level. We first treat each
institution that has issued a list as a node. For each pair of institutions, if institution B included the same entity on their list at a later time than institution
A, we add a weight (that is, 1) to the edges between A and B. A pair of institutions have no edges if there are no common entities on the lists that they
have issued. We ignore cases when two institutions add an entity on precisely
the same date, as the direction of influence is not clear. This procedure produces
a weighted directed network of institutions, as shown in Fig. 2. The network can
be decomposed into two communities, distinguished by two colors, using standard modularity maximization techniques [2, 8]. Note that the position on the

hierarchical component of the network, where information flows from nodes with
higher potentials to nodes with lower ones. Mathematically, this can be written
as
Fijp = wij (φi − φj ),

where wij is the weight of the edges between nodes i, and j and φi denotes
the Helmholtz–Hodge potential associated with node i. The Helmholtz–Hodge
potential of a node reflects its hierarchical position in its flow structure, which
neglects the effect from the feedback mechanism. The potential φi for every node
can be easily determined by minimizing the overall squared difference between
the actual flow and the gradient flow (see [6, 7] for more details).

Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America) are shown
in bold font. We can see that the OECD and the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda (ICTR), which are primarily focused on specific issues, top the list,
which shows that they are less influenced by the sanctions lists issued by other
institutions. This observation is quite intuitive because the smart sanctions issued by these institutions are restricted to focusing on specific issues. However,
an analysis using all the smart sanctions lists is somewhat vague, locating a large
proportion of the institutions in the middle. To look deeper into the structure,
we must divide the smart sanctions lists into categories.

Table 2: Gradient and loop ratio for each category.

In this section, we provide results obtained by restricting the set of lists
used to derive the influence network. We use seven out of the nine categories
found, as depicted in Fig. 1, excluding categories A (that is, issued by Japanese
bureaucracy) and E (embargoes) because only a few countries were involved in
the country-level network created from these smart sanction lists. The gradient
and loop ratio are relative measures quantifying to what extent the flow structure
is hierarchical and circular respectively (i.e., Fig. 3). The two ratios are thereby
complementary to each other so that the sum of them is always normalized
to 1. Table 2 summarizes the gradient and loop ratios of all the networks. We
observe that the loop ratio ranges from 0.11 to 0.21 for almost all the network,
which indicates that a non–negligible amount of information loops through the
network. However, for smart sanctions against terrorism in general, the loop ratio
is close to 0.0, which means that there is almost no loop structure. Hierarchical
components dominate the network, and information flows to a hub, as shown in
Fig. 6(b). In all cases, the average value of the Helmholtz-Hodge potential is set

to 0.0. Thus, if the potential of a node is positive, we can conclude that it is
located in the upper stream side, and vice versa.
In Fig. 5, we show the result of our Helmholtz–Hodge analysis for the financial crime category (that is, B in Fig. 1). As in Fig. 2, the y-axis position
is determined using the Helmholtz–Hodge potential and the x-position is determined using the method of [10]. In this influence network, we see that there are
many players involved, which creates four different communities (North America, Europe, island nations in the Indian Ocean, and other significant countries)
where each community focuses on different sets of targeted entities. Moreover,
the North American community and the island nation’s community are located
in distinct positions on the left, which reflects the similarity between these communities.

Fig. 6: Analysis of the community structure of the influence network at the level

In Fig. 6a, we show the influence network for the Libya category (G in Fig.
1). In this example, we find two distinct communities. One reflects countries
and institutions that heavily influence the European Union (such as the United

10

Hisano et al.

Nations, Switzerland, and Japan) and the other reflecting institutions that influence INTERPOL. Figure 6b shows the result for sanctions against Africa (D in
Fig. 1). Italy is at the far top of the hierarchy, but there is only one edge pointing
to the United States. Switzerland and the United Kingdom are key players that
strongly influence the European Union, whereas Australia seems to be a follower
of the European Union decisions.
Figures 7a and 7b showcases in which there is only one community in the
network. Figure 7a corresponds to smart sanctions against Burma (F in Fig. 1),
and Fig. 7b corresponds to terrorism in general. In both cases, Switzerland is the
key player that strongly affects the European Union’s decision. Luxembourg is
another key player in the Burma case, but it is quite interesting that Switzerland
and Luxembourg do not have much influence on each other.

Figure 8a shows the result for the Al-Qaeda case (I in Fig. 1). This is a quite
complex case in which there are three communities and many edges among
the institutions, which makes the network quite dense. We can see that the

United Nations and the European Union are both working as hubs, gathering
information from various countries. Still, the United Nations seems to be leading
the European Union, as could be suspected by its position. In Fig. 8b, we show
the case concerning the sanctions against Iran and North Korea. In this case, we
also see that the European Union acts as a hub, gathering information worldwide.
It is also noteworthy that the United Nations Security Council is apparently at
the bottom of the hierarchy, which indicates the complex approval mechanism
of this council [5].

Table 3 summarizes the Helmholtz–Hodge potential for selected countries.
Several things are worth mentioning here. Switzerland appears in almost all
categories, with positive values for each category. This observation indicates
that Switzerland is quite an active player when it comes to smart sanctions.
Australia, however, does appear in many categories but instead has a negative
overall position (except for Iran-North Korea), which indicates that it is more of
a follower. The United States is notably in a high position for Al-Qaeda, Libya,
Africa, and terrorism in general, but is located in the lower part for financial
crimes. Japan, conversely, is located in the lower part for Al-Qaeda but is an
active player when it comes to terrorism in general. To summarize, our analysis
provides meaningful insights into the hierarchical influences underlying smart
sanctions lists.

Conclusion

This paper makes two contributions. The first is that we showed how to construct
an influence network governing smart sanctions at the country level from the
smart sanctions lists each country has issued. We then showed that by performing
a Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition of the influence network, we could shed some
light on the influence network that governs the institutions issuing such lists.
Specifically, we derived three interesting observations from our Helmholtz–
Hodge analysis. First, we found that for smart sanctions lists against Iran and
North Korea, while the United Kingdom, United Nations, and the United States
are at the top of the hierarchy of influencing other major countries and international institutions, the United Nations Security Council is clearly at the bottom
of the hierarchy, which indicates its complex approval mechanism. Second, for
the smart sanctions against Libya, the United Nations, ICTR, United States,
and Japan are the key influencers in the upper stream of the hierarchy, and
INTERPOL and the European Union are located in the middle of the hierarchy,
acting as hubs aggregating information. Another intriguing example is the smart
sanctions concerning financial crimes. In this example, there are four different
communities (North America, Europe, island nations, and other countries), and
each community focuses on different sets of targeted entities.
Furthermore, for some of the smart sanctions list categories, the influence
network is governed almost entirely by a hierarchical structure. Still, for others,
there is a significant amount of loop flow, which indicates that countries and
international institutions actively influence each other. Our simple and effective
analysis enables a better understanding of the hidden global political structure
behind smart sanctions.
