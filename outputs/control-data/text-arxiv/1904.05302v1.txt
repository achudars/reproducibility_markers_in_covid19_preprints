Abstract. In this paper we shall use the boundary Schwarz lemma
of Osserman to obtain some generalisations and refinements of
some well known results concerning the maximum modulus of the
polynomials with restricted zeros due to Turán, Dubinin and others.

1. Introduction
Let Pn denote the class of all algebraic polynomials of the form
n
P
P (z) =
aj z j of degree n ≥ 1. It was shown by P. Turán [14] that if
j=o

P ∈ Pn has all its zeros in |z| ≤ 1, then
n
max |P ′(z)| ≥ max |P (z)|.
(1.1)
|z|=1
2 |z|=1

Equality in (1.1) holds for P (z) = az n + b, |a| = |b| = 1.
As an extension of (1.1), Govil [8] proved that if P ∈ Pn and P (z)
has all its zeros in |z| ≤ k, k ≥ 1, then
n
(1.2)
max |P (z)|.
max |P ′(z)| ≥
|z|=1
1 + k n |z|=1
The result is sharp as shown by the polynomial P (z) = z n + k n .
By involving the minimum modulus of P (z) on |z| = 1, Aziz and
Dawood [2], proved under the hypothesis of inequality (1.1) that

Equality in (1.3) holds for P (z) = az n + b, |a| = |b| = 1.
In literature, there exist several generalizations and extensions of
(1.1), (1.2) and (1.3) (see [1]-[5],[10], [12], [13]). Dubinin [7] obtain a
refinement of (1.1) by involving some of the coefficients of polynomial
P ∈ Pn in the bound of inequality (1.1). More precisely, proved that

2. Main results
In this paper, we are interested in estimating the lower bound for
the maximum modulus of P ′(z) on |z| = 1 for P ∈ Pn not vanshing
in the region |z| > k where k ≥ 1 and establish some refinements and
generalizations of the inequalities (1.1), (1.2), (1.3) and (1.4). We begin
by proving:
Theorem 2.1. If all the zeros of polynomial P ∈ Pn of degree n ≥ 2
lie in |z| ≤ k, k ≥ 1, then

The result is best possible and equality in (2.1) holds for P (z) = z n +k n .
Remark 2.1. Since all the zeros of P (z) lie in |z| ≤ k where k ≥
1, therefore, |a0 | ≤ k n |an |. In view of this, inequality 2.1 constitutes
a refinement of inequality (1.2). Further, inequality (2.1) reduces to
inequality (1.4) for k = 1.
Theorem 2.2. If all the zeros of polynomial P ∈ Pn of degree n ≥ 2
lie in |z| ≤ k where k ≥ 1 and m = min|z|=k |P (z)|, then for 0 ≤ l < 1

where φ(k) and ψ(k) are same as defined in Theorem 2.1.
The result is sharp and equality in (2.2) holds for P (z) = z n + k n .
Remark 2.2. As before, it can be easily seen that Theorem 2.2 is a
refinement of Theorem 2.1. Moreover, for k = 1, we get the following
result which includes a refinement of inequality (1.4) as a special case.

3. Lemmas
For the proof of these theorems, we need the following lemmas. The
first Lemma is due to P. Erdös and P. D. Lax [9]
Lemma 3.1. If P ∈ Pn does not vanish in |z| < 1, then
max |P ′(z)| ≤

(3.1)

|z|=1

n
max |P (z)|.
2 |z|=1

Next Lemma is a special case of a result due to Aziz and Rather[3, 4].
Lemma 3.2. If P ∈ Pn and P (z) has its all zeros in |z| ≤ 1 and

Q(z) = z n P 1/z , then for |z| = 1,
|Q′ (z)| ≤ |P ′(z)|.

The following result is due to Frappier, Rahman and Ruscheweyh [6].
Lemma 3.3. If P ∈ Pn is a polynomial of degree n ≥ 1, then for
R ≥ 1,
(3.2) max |P (z)| ≤ Rn max |P (z)| − (Rn − Rn−2 )|P (0)|
|z|=R

if

and
(3.3)

From above lemma, we deduce:

Proof of Lemma 3.4. By hypothesis all the zeros of P (z) lie in |z| ≥
1. Let m = min|z|=1 |P (z)|, then m ≤ |P (z)| for |z| = 1. Applying
Rouche’s theorem, it follows that the polynomial G(z) = P (z) + αmz n
has all its zeros in |z| ≥ 1 for every α with |α| < 1 (this is trivially true
for m = 0.) Now for each θ, 0 ≤ θ < 2π, we have

which proves inequality (3.4) for n > 2 and |α| < 1. Similarly we can
prove inequality (3.5) for n = 2 by using (3.3) of Lemma 3.3 instead of
(3.2). For |α| = 1, the result follows by continuity. This completes the
proof of Lemma 3.4.

Finally we also need the Lemma due to Osserman [11], known as
boundary Schwarz lemma.
Lemma 3.5. If
(a)
f (z) is analytic for |z| < 1,
(b)
|f (z)| < 1 for |z| < 1,
(c)
f (0) = 0,
(d)
for some b with |b| = 1, f (z) extends continuously to b,
|f (b)| = 1 and f ′ (b) exists.
Then

4. Proof of the Theorems
Proof of Theorem
2.1. Let g(z) = P (kz). Since all the zeros of
Q
P (z) = an nj=1 (z − zj ) lie in |z| ≤ k where k ≥ 1, g(z) has all its
zeros in |z| ≤ 1 and hence all the zeros of the conjugate polynomial
g ∗ (z) = z n g(1/z̄) lie in |z| ≥ 1.
Therefore, the function

which proves inequality (2.1) for the case n > 1. For the case n = 2, the
result follows on similar lines in view of part second of Lemma 3.3 and
Lemma 3.4 with α = 0. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1. 
Proof of Theorem 2.2. By hypothesis P ∈ Pn and P (z) has all its
zeros in |z| ≤ k, k ≥ 1. If P (z) has a zero on |z| = k, then m = 0
and the result follows by Theorem 2.1. Henceforth, we assume that
all the zeros of P (z) lie in |z| < k, so that m > 0. Hence all the
zeros of h(z) = P (kz) lie in disk |z| < 1 and m = min|z|=k |P (z)| =
min|z|=1 |h(z)|. Therefore, we have m ≤ |h(z)| for |z| = 1. This implies
for every λ ∈ C with |λ| < 1 that
m|λz n | < |h(z)|

for |z| = 1.

Applying Rouche’s theorem, it follows that all the zeros of the polynomial H(z) = h(z) + λmz n lie in |z| < 1 for every λ ∈ C with |λ| < 1.

The above inequality is equivalent to the inequality (2.2) for n > 2.
For n = 2, the result follows on the similar lines by using inequality
(3.3) of Lemma 3.3 and inequality (3.5) of Lemma 3.4 in the inequality
(4.11). This proves Theorem 2.2.

5. Concluding Remark
If we use Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.4 with |α| = 1 in the proof of
Theorem 2.1, we get the following refinement of inequalities (1.2) and
(2.1).
Theorem 5.1. If P ∈ Pn has all its zeros in |z| ≤ k where k ≥ 1, then
(5.1)


k n |an | − |a0 |
1
max |P (z)| + |a1 |ψ(k)
n+ n
max |P (z)| ≥
|z|=1
1 + kn
k |an | + |a0 | |z|=1


kn − 1
k n |an | − |a0 |
+ n
n+ n
min |P (z)|
2k (1 + k n )
k |an | + |a0 | |z|=1
′

where

ψ(k) = 1 − 1/k 2 or (1 − 1/k) according as n > 2 or n = 2.

The result is sharp and equality in (5.1) holds for P (z) = z n + k n .
