ABSTRACT

Extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac objects (EHBLs) are an emerging class of blazars.
Their typical two-hump structured spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks at higher
energies with respect to conventional blazars. Multi-wavelength (MWL) observations
constrain their synchrotron peak in the medium to hard X-ray band. Their gamma-ray
SED peaks above the GeV band, and in some objects it extends up to several TeV.
Up to now, only a few EHBLs have been detected in the TeV gamma-ray range. In
this paper, we report the detection of the EHBL 2WHSP J073326.7+515354, observed
and detected during 2018 in TeV gamma rays with the MAGIC telescopes. The broadband SED is studied within a MWL context, including an analysis of the Fermi -LAT
data over ten years of observation and with simultaneous Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT,
and KVA data. Our analysis results in a set of spectral parameters that confirms the
classification of the source as an EHBL. In order to investigate the physical nature of
this extreme emission, different theoretical frameworks were tested to model the broadband SED. The hard TeV spectrum of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 sets the SED far
from the energy equipartition regime in the standard one-zone leptonic scenario of
blazar emission. Conversely, more complex models of the jet, represented by either a
two-zone spine-layer model or a hadronic emission model, better represent the broadband SED.

INTRODUCTION

Blazars are active galactic nuclei (AGN) with relativistic
jets closely aligned with the line of sight of the observer.
Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) generally consist
of two main non-thermal components. Typically, the first
component is ascribed to synchrotron radiation emitted by
relativistic electrons moving within the jet. Different scenarios have been proposed to explain the nature of the second hump peaking at higher energies. The standard leptonic
scenario suggests that this second hump is produced by inverse Compton (IC) scattering of low-energy photons (Rees
1967). In the Synchrotron-Self-Compton (SSC) model (e.g.,
Maraschi et al. 1992; Tavecchio et al. 1998), this photon field
may be composed by the synchrotron emission responsible
for the first SED hump. Additionally, this high-energy hump
might be associated with external photon fields that are upscattered by IC scattering in the External Compton scenario
(Dermer & Schlickeiser 1993).
Relativistic protons might also be accelerated in the
blazar jet. When sufficiently high energies are reached to
allow photo-pion production, electromagnetic cascades will
develop and contribute to the emission of the high-energy
hump, in addition to proton, muon, and pion synchrotron
radiation (Mannheim 1993; Boettcher 2010). Moreover, in
the so-called hadronic cascade scenario, ultra-high energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs) might interact in the intergalactic
space through photo-hadronic reactions and produce photons that contribute to the high-energy hump (e.g., Essey &
Kusenko 2010; Murase et al. 2012; Tavecchio 2014). Finally,
this second hump may be also produced by a combination
of leptonic and hadronic processes.
Blazars are historically subdivided into two main
categories. The objects that show broad emission lines in
their optical spectrum are classified as Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). When these lines have an equivalent
width of less than 5 Å, blazars are defined as BL Lac objects. It has been suggested that blazars follow the so-called
“blazar sequence” (Fossati et al. 1998), based on the anticorrelation between the bolometric luminosity and the peak
energy of their SED humps (Ghisellini 1999; Ghisellini &
Tavecchio 2008; Ghisellini et al. 2017). Conversely, some
authors argue that the blazar sequence might be due to
selection effects (see e.g., Antón & Browne 2005; Giommi
et al. 2012). The FSRQs, whose synchrotron peak is located
at low frequencies, are the “redder” blazars. The BL Lac
objects populate the sequence at higher frequencies. Blazars
are further divided in sub-classes depending on the frequency
sync
of the synchrotron peak νpeak
: they are classified as lowsync
peaked objects (LBL, with νpeak
< 1014 Hz), intermediatesync
peaked objects (IBL, with νpeak between 1014 and 1015 Hz),
sync
and high-peaked objects (HBL, νpeak
between 1015 and 1017
Hz), according to Abdo et al. (2010).
Costamante et al. (2001a) proposed a new class of
BL Lac objects with extreme spectral properties and located
at the very edge of the blazar sequence, named extreme highfrequency peaked blazars (EHBLs). In this work, we will use
the definition of EHBL based on the synchrotron peak posync
sition νpeak
located above 1017 Hz.
The archetypal EHBL is 1ES 0229+200.
Its archival SED has been observed in detail by several multi-wavelength (MWL) observational campaigns dur-

ing the last years, and shows the key features of this class
of objects. In fact, in the EHBLs the synchrotron hump is
shifted towards high energies with respect to conventional
blazars, making the thermal optical radiation of the host
galaxy visible for low-redshift objects.
The synchrotron peak located in the medium-to-hard
X-ray band pushes the second SED peak to the very-highenergy gamma-ray band (VHE, energies above 100 GeV).
For this reason, EHBLs are generally supposed to be faint in
high-energy (HE, energies between 100 MeV and 100 GeV)
gamma rays (Tavecchio et al. 2010). The intrinsic spectrum
of 1ES 0229+200 at VHE is the hardest ever measured (e.g.,
Aharonian et al. 2007c; Aliu et al. 2014). Similar hard spectra have been reported for few other sources, like for example 1ES 0347-121 (Aharonian et al. 2007b), RGB J0710+591
(Acciari et al. 2010), and 1ES 1101-232 (Aharonian et al.
2007a). In these objects, the peak of the second hump extends beyond several TeV, and for this reason they have also
been called “hard-TeV blazars” by Costamante et al. (2018).
This feature makes their SEDs challenging for the standard one-zone leptonic SSC model. In that scenario, the
model would suggest rather soft SSC spectra at TeV energies due to the decreasing scattering cross section with
energy in the Klein-Nishina regime (Tavecchio et al. 2009).
In order to explain such a shift in the SED peaks, the minimum Lorentz factor of the electron energy distribution γmin
has to be very high and the magnetic field intensity B is
required to be very low with respect to the standard values
inferred in classical TeV BL Lac objects (Tavecchio et al.
2010; Lefa et al. 2011).
To explain the hard-TeV spectra in EHBLs, different alternative models have been proposed. Saugé & Henri (2004)
and Lefa et al. (2011), for example, adopt extremely hard
Maxwellian particle distributions, while Katarzynski et al.
(2006) and Tavecchio et al. (2009) use a low-energy cutoff of the electron distribution at VHE. In the case of
1ES 0229+200, the intergalactic cascades scenario (Murase
et al. 2012) was successfully applied to explain the hard TeV
spectrum. Finally, thanks to the evidence of scarce and lowamplitude flux variability and their hard TeV gamma-ray
spectra, EHBLs turn out to be interesting candidates for
hadronic and lepto-hadronic emission models, that can well
reproduce their observed SEDs (e.g., Murase et al. 2012;
Cerruti et al. 2015).
The hard VHE gamma-ray spectrum of EHBLs extending up to several TeV – as that observed in sources like
1ES 0229+200 – is also an important probe for testing models of the extragalactic background light (EBL, see e.g.,
Hauser & Dwek 2001) and of the intergalactic magnetic fields
(IGMF, e.g., Vovk et al. 2012).
MWL observations have revealed that other EHBL objects have high synchrotron peak frequencies similar to 1ES
0229+200, but much softer TeV spectra with an IC hump
clearly peaking in the GeV to TeV band (e.g., Costamante
et al. 2001b, 2018). Additionally, some very bright HBL
sources (like, for example, Mrk 501) have shown EHBL-like
behavior during some flaring episodes (Pian et al. 1998; Ahnen et al. 2018). Hence, the EHBL class might be a complex population of sources, characterized by different spectral properties (Foffano et al. 2019), or even associated to
high-activity states of some blazars.
Hard-TeV blazars are the EHBL sources with the highMNRAS 000, 1–15 (2019)

est IC peak frequency, and the difficulties in modeling their
SEDs are generally related to this extreme spectral property.
However, EHBLs with a more moderate IC peak located below a few TeV might be good candidates for testing theoretical models. The successful application of theoretical models
to different EHBLs might help in understanding why the
high synchrotron peak is not always correlated with a hard
VHE spectrum, and might help to unveil the origin of the
extreme particle acceleration mechanism of this class. The
differences in the spectral properties we find in the EHBL
category and the low number of known objects of this class
motivate their monitoring and the search for new candidates.
An accurate description of the broad-band spectrum
is essential to understand the origin of the extreme SED
properties of EHBLs, especially in the gamma-ray band.
For example, dedicated studies have been recently carried
out in the HE gamma-ray band performing detailed analyses of faint Fermi-LAT sources (Arsioli et al. 2018). In this
framework, the TeV gamma-ray band plays a key role in the
EHBLs characterization. However, up to now only a few such
sources have been observed and characterized in the VHE
gamma-ray regime. New TeV observations of EHBL objects
are needed in order to increase the EHBL population and
possibly disclose the physical interpretation of such extreme
spectral properties.
In this paper, we provide a set of new VHE
gamma-ray
observations
on
an
EHBL
named
2WHSP J073326.7+515354. This blazar, also named
PGC 2402248, has been selected from the 2WHSP catalogue
(Chang et al. 2017) on the basis of its high synchrotron peak
sync
frequency equal to νpeak,2WHSP
= 1017.9 Hz. It is associated
with the Fermi-LAT source 3FGL J0733.5+5153 in the
3FGL catalogue (Acero et al. 2015) as active galaxy of uncertain type, and reported in the 3FHL catalogue (Ajello et al.
2017) as associated with the source 3FHL J0733.4+51523
with a spectral index of ΓHE = 1.34 ± 0.43. Additionally, the source 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 is compatible with the position (at 2.4 arcmin) of the source
SWIFT J0733.9+5156 (position uncertainty 5.67 arcmin),
that is reported also in the Swift-BAT 105-months catalogue
(Oh et al. 2018). In this catalogue, the reported flux of the
−12
source is 8.1710.44
erg cm−2 s−1 with a spectral
6.00 × 10
index of 2.323.25
.

The MAGIC observations led to the first detection of
this source in TeV gamma rays on 2018 April 19 (Mirzoyan
2018). During the MAGIC pointings, simultaneous observations were performed by the KVA, Swift-UVOT/XRT,
and Fermi-LAT telescopes. Additionally, optical data were
collected with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) in order to estimate the redshift of the source that was previously unknown. The new measurement of the redshift of
MNRAS 000, 1–15 (2019)

2WHSP J073326.7+515354 was reported as z = 0.065 (Becerra Gonzalez et al. 2018). This value is particularly important for the estimation of the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum
of the source, and consequently for testing the theoretical
emission models of the broad-band SED.
The structure of this paper is the following: in Section 2, we describe the observations and results from the
MAGIC observations. In addition, simultaneous observations performed by KVA, Swift, and the long-integration
analysis of the Fermi-LAT telescope data are presented.
In Section 3 the variability at different frequencies is discussed. In Section 4, we report the collected broad-band
SED and a discussion about the observational properties
of the source. In Section 5, we provide a discussion on
the modeling of the SED, performed by means of leptonic
and hadronic models. Finally, we report in Section 6 the
conclusions of this work and future prospects. We adopt
H0 = 67 km s−1 Mpc−1 , ΩΛ = 0.7, ΩM = 0.3 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2018).

OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS

2WHSP J073326.7+515354 was observed in the VHE
gamma-ray band with the MAGIC telescopes, in the optical and UV bands with the KVA telescope and Swift-UVOT
and in the X-ray band with Swift-XRT. Additionally, an
analysis of the sample collected by Fermi-LAT during more
than ten years of operation was performed.

2.1

The MAGIC telescopes

MAGIC (Aleksić et al. 2016a) is a system of two Imaging
Air-shower Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed to indirectly detect gamma rays through the Cherenkov emission
of the charged component of the extensive air shower they
generate interacting with Earth’s atmosphere. The two telescopes are located on the Canary island of La Palma, at
2200 m altitude. Their large reflective surface of 17 m diameter each allows the MAGIC telescopes to reach, under good
observational conditions, an energy threshold as low as 50
GeV when operated in standard trigger mode. The integral
sensitivity for point-like sources above 220 GeV, assuming
a Crab Nebula-like spectrum, is (0.66 ± 0.03)% of the Crab
Nebula flux in 50 h of observations. At those energies the angular resolution is 0.07 degree, while the energy resolution
reaches 16%. The performance of the instrument and the
details on the data analysis procedure are fully described in
Aleksić et al. (2016b) and references therein.

2.1.1

Observations

MAGIC observed the source 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 for
a total of 23.4 h in 2018 within an observational program
aimed at searching for new EHBLs in the TeV gamma-ray
band. The observations were performed during 25 nights
from 2018 January 23 to April 19 (MJD 58141-58227), with
zenith angle range between 23◦ and 40◦ and good data quality. The data have been analysed using the MAGIC Analysis
and Reconstruction Software (MARS, Moralejo et al. 2009;
Aleksić et al. 2016b).

2.1.2

Signal search

The emission from a source in VHE gamma rays can be evaluated by means of the so-called θ2 plot. The θ2 parameter is
defined as the squared angular distance between the reconstructed incoming direction of the gamma-ray event and the
nominal position of the source in camera coordinates. The
typical signature of VHE point-like sources, after the application of energy-dependent background suppression cuts, is
an excess at low θ2 values. In general, a source is considered

detected in the VHE gamma-ray range, if the significance
of the excess of gamma-like events over background events
exceeds 5 σ. The significance of the gamma-ray signal is estimated with formula n.17 of Li & Ma (1983).
The θ2 plot for 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 is shown
in Figure 1a. An excess of 95 ± 16 events in the standard
fiducial signal region with θ2 < 0.009 deg2 is found,
corresponding to a significance of 6.76 σ. The θ2 distribution shows a fluctuation of the gamma-like events
with respect to the background events in the region from
0.04 to 0.12 deg2 . In order to investigate whether this
fluctuation is significant, we compare the θ2 distribution for 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 with regards to the
reference Point Spread Function (PSF) obtained from a
Crab Nebula data sample observed contemporaneously to
2WHSP J073326.7+515354. The PSF was also rescaled
to the 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 spectrum and zenith
distribution. Following Da Vela et al. (2018), the PSF and
the θ2 -plot of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 were fitted with
the King function, and a comparison among the parameters
was performed. The fit has been performed up to θ2 = 0.45
deg2 . The PSF computed for 2WHSP J073326.7+515354
is consistent (χ2 /DOF = 89/98) with the reference PSF of
the instrument. In Figure 1b the residuals plot of the fit is
shown. This check confirms that the possible mismatch with
the background in the region from 0.04 to 0.12 deg2 is not
statistically significant, and represent a casual fluctuation
of the background.

2.1.3

Spectrum

The spectrum of the source 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 observed with the MAGIC telescopes, reported in Figure 2, was
reconstructed between 0.1 and 8 TeV using the Tikhonov
unfolding method (Albert et al. 2007) in order to include

migrations between true and reconstructed energy. It can be
described by a simple power-law model (χ2 /DOF = 2.4/3):

where the observed photon index is Γobs = 2.41 ± 0.17stat ,
and the corresponding normalization constant f0,obs =

of 200 GeV. A detailed discussion on the systematic uncertainties can be found in Aleksić et al. (2016b).
The intrinsic spectrum, after correcting for the absorption due to the interaction with the EBL according
to the model by Dominguez et al. (2011), can be fitted
with a power-law function (χ2 /DOF = 2.8/3) with a photon index Γintr = 1.99 ± 0.16 and a normalization constant
f0,intr = (2.03 ± 0.13) × 10−11 ph cm−2 s−1 TeV−1 at the
same energy of 200 GeV. Other EBL models applied to correct the data provide compatible results.
Since
the
resulting
SED
from
2WHSP J073326.7+515354 at VHE is substantially
flat, the source has a second hump likely peaking at few
TeV (see later for further details). This is a first difference
with respect to the hard-TeV blazars of Costamante et al.
(2018), which show continuously increasing flux up to at
least several TeV and hard spectral index of the order
of 1.5 ∼ 1.7. A summary of the source characteristics
and results from the VHE data analysis can be found in
Table 1. The flux results above 200 GeV as a function of
the observation time are given in Table A1.

2.2

Fermi -LAT data analysis

The pair-conversion Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board
the Fermi satellite monitors the gamma-ray sky in survey
mode every three hours in the energy range from 20 MeV to
> 300 GeV (Atwood et al. 2009). For this work, a region of
interest (ROI) centered around 2WHSP J073326.7+515354
(4FGL J0733.4+5152) with a radius of 7◦ was selected. The
data sample included more than ten years of data collected
by Fermi-LAT, from 2008 August 4 to 2019 June 24 (MJD
54682-58658). The data reduction of the events of the Pass8
source class was performed with the Science-Tools software
package version v11r5p3 in the energy range 0.5-300 GeV.
To reduce Earth limb contamination a zenith angle cut of
90◦ was applied to the data. The binned likelihood fit of the
data was performed using the recommended Galactic diffuse
emission model (see e.g., Acero et al. 2016) and isotropic
component recommended for Pass8 (P8R2) source event
class1 .
The normalizations of both diffuse components in the
source model were allowed to freely vary during the spectral fitting. In addition to the source of interest, all the
sources included in the 4FGL catalogue (The Fermi-LAT
collaboration 2019) within a distance of 14 degrees from
the source of interest were included. We build the likelihood model including all the 4FGL sources within 14 degrees from the position. For the likelihood minimization we
leave free to vary the spectral parameters of the sources in

likelihood fit was carried out in two steps, After a first fit,
the targets with Test Statistics (TS) < 2 were removed
from the model. After that cut, a final likelihood fit was
carried out. We did not find significant residuals, which
could suggest the presence of additional sources in the ROI.
2WHSP J073326.7+515354 was detected with a TS=138.8, a
flux of F (0.5−300GeV) = (1.3±0.5)×10−9 ph cm−2 s−1 and
a hard spectral index of Γ = 1.73±0.11 (compatible with the
value reported in the 4FGL catalogue, Γ4F GL = 1.80±0.10).
The same analysis is carried out in 2-year time bins to study
the flux evolution of the source. The results are shown in Table A2.

bottom, we present the MAGIC flux and 95% C.L. upper-limits (arrows) above 200 GeV, the Swift-XRT 0.3-10 keV flux
points, the Swift-UVOT points (in the U-band in violet, W1-band in red, and W2-band in dark green), and the KVA optical
flux points (after host galaxy subtraction). For the X-ray and optical energy bands, we report in light grey the 1σ-band around
the average flux. The MAGIC flux has been computed in night-wise (in blue) and monthly binning (black). For the X-ray and
UV energy bands, we report in dashed light grey lines the highest average flux obtained during 2014 observations. Due to the
low flux emitted by the source in the HE band, the light-curve as observed by the Fermi-LAT can only be produced in large
time bins larger than the scale shown in this figure.
have a total exposure time of ∼ 2.7 h with an average of
1.2 ks per observation. The observation data were analysed
based on the standard Swift analysis procedure described
by Evans et al. (2009) using the configuration described by
Fallah Ramazani et al. (2017) for the photon counting observation mode and assuming a fixed equivalent Galactic hydrogen column density of NH = 5.12 × 1020 cm−2 (Kalberla
et al. 2005).
The spectra for each individual daily observation were
fitted by a power-law and a log-parabola function. In all
cases, the log-parabola fit did not improve significantly the
result (lower than 3 sigma confidence level -C.L.-) with respect to the power-law fit. The results of this analysis are
reported in Table A3 together with data obtained by SwiftXRT since 2009. The X-ray spectrum of the source is hard,
with a photon index 1.5 ≤ ΓX ≤ 1.6 on the data strictly
simultaneous to the MAGIC campaign, but with hint of a
softer spectrum in the archival data with larger uncertainty.

2.3.2

UVOT observations

During the Swift pointings in 2018, the UVOT instrument
observed 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 in its optical (U) and
UV (W1 and W2) photometric bands (Poole et al. 2008;
Breeveld et al. 2010). We analysed the data using the uvotsource task included in the HEAsoft package (v6.23). Source

counts were extracted from a circular region of 5 arcsec radius centred on the source, while background counts were derived from a circular region of 20 arcsec radius in a nearby
source-free region. The observed magnitudes are corrected
for extinction using the E(B–V) value of 0.50 from Schlafly
& Finkbeiner (2011) and the extinction laws from Cardelli
et al. (1989) and converted to flux densities. The results for
each individual observation are shown in Table A4.

2.4

KVA data analysis

The Tuorla blazar monitoring program3 has observed
2WHSP J073326.7+515354 coordinated with the MAGIC
observations since 2018 April. These observations were performed in the R-band (Cousins) by the 35 cm telescope
attached to the Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien Academy
(KVA) system. The data were analysed using the differential photometry method described by Nilsson et al. (2018).
In order to perform differential photometry, the comparison
stars were selected in the same field of view (reported in Figure 3). To measure their magnitude, the source was observed
among many other blazars with known comparison stars on
the night of 2018 April 2. The results of the calibration in
the R band of the comparison stars in Figure 3 are: star

n.1 with magnitude 13.11, star n.2 with magnitude 14.29,
star n.3 with magnitude 11.93, and star n.4 with magnitude
13.63. The average zero point of the night was calculated
from the photometric zero point magnitude of each image
using constant aperture taking into account the effect of airmass.
The contribution of the host galaxy flux is calculated
by combining 55 good quality images taken by the KVA
telescope. The images are treated for bias, dark, flat-fielding
and fringe map corrections. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo
ensemble sampler (e.g Martino & Elvira 2017) was used to
map an a posteriori distribution in the three-dimensional
parameter space. The resulting images are aligned using the
stars in the FoV and the median combining method. The
combined image has a total exposure of 5500 s with a full
width at half-maximum of FWHM= 3.000 . The comparison
star No. 3 (Figure 3) was used to calibrate the field. Following the method described in MAGIC Collaboration et al.
(2018), we use the combined deep R-band image to search
for the host galaxy emission.
In order to study its host galaxy, we fitted twodimensional surface brightness models to the light distribution of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354. First, we fit a point
source model (with three free parameters, i.e. the source
x–y positions and the nucleus flux) with the Sersić index
equal to 4 to fix the position of the nucleus. A second fit
was performed with a model of a point source and an elliptical host galaxy of ellipticity equal to zero. The positions determined in the first model were used as first order approximation for the position of the core and the host
galaxy. Both models were convolved with the PSF which
was determined from the comparison with star n.3. The
fits were made to pixels within 18 pix from the center of
2WHSP J073326.7+515354. We employed 50 independent
walkers, each completing 2000 iteration steps and with flat
priors. The best-fitting (mode of the posteriors) parameters
of the second model are host galaxy flux Rhost = 14.88 mag
and effective radius reff = 6.800 . The core flux in the R-band
optical is Rcore = 17.36 mag. From these data, the host
galaxy flux within an aperture of 500 is Fhost = 1.38 mJy.
The results of the Tuorla blazar monitoring are preMNRAS 000, 1–15 (2019)

VARIABILITY

The MWL light-curve from optical to VHE gamma rays is
shown in Figure 4. The X-ray observations allow us to study
the variability of the synchrotron flux and the peak of its
emission, while the gamma-ray light-curve from MAGIC can
be used to infer the flux evolution in the high energy peak.
Since the light-curve from Fermi-LAT has been computed
on large time bins of two years over all ten years of observations, we report in Table A2 the flux and photon index
measurements in this energy band.
In the optical band, the KVA observations during the
MAGIC campaign were carried out in the R filter. The results are compatible with a constant flux of 3.74 ± 0.1 mJy,
yielding a χ2 /DOF of 6.6/11.
In the UV band, as observed by Swift-UVOT with filters U, W1 and W2, even though the statistics are sparse,
no strong flux variations were detected over the course of
the MAGIC observation campaign. The flux is compatible
with a constant fit of (1.3 ± 0.2) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 with
χ2 /DOF of 0.5/3 and (1.76±0.05)×10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 with
χ2 /DOF of 4.6/4 for the bands W1 and U, respectively. For
the band W2, only one observation is available during that
period, and therefore no conclusion for variability can be derived. As reported in Table A4, in comparison with historical observations from 2009 and 2011, the source shows fluxes
compatible with the average fluxes reported above. However,
during January 2014 the source showed fluxes higher by a
factor of about 4-5 times compared to the average flux during the MAGIC observation window in both the U and W2
bands.
The X-ray observations performed by Swift-XRT during the MAGIC observation campaign show moderate variability. A constant fit to the flux evolution during that period can be discarded at a 3.7 σ C.L. (χ2 /DOF of 29.6/8).
The previous observations of the source carried out between 2009 and 2014 show a flux range of 1 to 3 × 10−12
erg cm−2 s−1 . When considering only simultaneous XRT
and MAGIC observations (MJD 58144, 58164, 58190, and
58227), the flux is compatible with a constant average flux
of (2.07 ± 0.15) × 10−11 erg cm−2 s−1 (χ2 /DOF of 6.8/4). A
marginal “harder-when-brighter” trend is found in the flux
vs spectral index observed in the X-ray band by Swift, as
shown in Figure 5. The trend can be fitted by a linear function with χ2 /DOF of 1.3/13) with slope of −1.64±0.62. This
trend is quite typical in BL Lacs, and has been observed in
several X-ray campaigns of Mrk 501 and Mrk 421 (e.g., Pian
et al. 1998; Ahnen et al. 2018).
Finally, in the Swift-BAT 105-months catalogue (Oh
et al. 2018) the source is detected with a signal to noise
ratio (SNR) of only 5.38, and no variability is reported.
Regarding the high-energy SED peak, the light curve is
limited due to the low flux of the target. For the flux evolution of the HE gamma rays observed by Fermi-LAT, a time
bin of two years was used in order to collect enough photon
statistics. As shown in Table A2, due to the weak detection,
the measured flux is compatible with a constant flux during

8

The MAGIC Collaboration

the first 10 years of operation of Fermi-LAT. We checked the
possible enhanced flux of the source of interest in the period
around January 2014, when there was an optical-UV flux
registered by Swift-UVOT few times higher with respect to
the average flux measured during the MAGIC observation
window. An analysis of the Fermi-LAT data over the period
from August 3rd , 2012 to August 3rd , 2014 (MJD 56142.756872.7, as reported in Table A2), which includes January
2014, reports no photons detected with probability >50%
of belonging to the source of interest. This result is also
compatible with the variability index of 39 reported in the
Fermi-LAT 3FGL catalogue (Acero et al. 2015), statistically
consistent with a steady source (variability threshold 72.44
as reported in the 3FGL catalogue). Moreover, the long-term
SED measured by Fermi-LAT connects smoothly with the
VHE gamma-ray SED observed by MAGIC as shown in Figure 6. Thus, while short term variability cannot be excluded
due to the low photon statistics and the fact that the long
integration of the signal might smooth out some modest flux
variations, the stability of the light curve on the long term
supports a steady flux condition of the source within the
sensitivity of the instrument.
For the VHE band, as shown in Figure 4 the source is
detected above 2σ C.L. only during four nightly observations
(blue points and arrows). The rest of the observations yield
upper limits. Due to the lack of strong variability detected
from the nightly observations (constant fit with χ2 /DOF of
16/21) and the low photon statistics, the monthly light-curve
is also evaluated (black points). Also with larger time bins,
the light-curve does not show any hint of variability, and the
average flux results in (3.4 ± 0.4) × 10−12 ph cm−2 s−1 with
χ2 /DOF of 1.2/4.
In summary, when considering only the MWL data simultaneous to the MAGIC observations, no significant variability is identified. Therefore, during the MAGIC observation campaign the source remained in a stable state.
Only some moderate variability was measured by SwiftUVOT/XRT when comparing with historical observations.

MULTI-WAVELENGTH SED

We present in Figure 6 the SED with the full data sample we assembled for 2WHSP J073326.7+515354. In grey,
we show the selected archival SSDC data (see caption for
details). Then we report in orange the KVA data, in blue
the Swift-UVOT data, in light red the Swift-XRT data, in
dark red the Swift-BAT data, in purple the Fermi-LAT data,
and in dark green the MAGIC data. In order to account for
the modest variability found with the Swift data, we will
consider only its data strictly simultaneous to MAGIC observations (MJD 58144, 58164, 58190, and 58227).
sync
Since the synchrotron peak position νpeak
is the basis of
the definition of EHBL, this value plays an important role
in classifying new sources of this class. In order to measure
sync
νpeak
, we performed a log-parabolic fit of the synchrotron
peak of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 as illustrated in Figure B1a. The fit performed only on the Swift-XRT X-ray
data simultaneous to MAGIC observations, being compatible with a power-law model, does not allow us to constrain the synchrotron peak location. For this reason, the
non-simultaneous Swift-BAT 105-month archival data were

used to provide a first estimation of the synchrotron peak.
sync
The resulting new estimation leads to νpeak
' 1017.8±0.3 Hz
2
(χ /DOF of 19/39). This value is compatible with the estimation reported in the 2WHSP catalogue (Chang et al.
sync
2017) of νpeak,2WHSP
= 1017.9 Hz and confirms the classification of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 as an EHBL.
Due to the high-frequency location of the synchrotron
peak, the SED exhibits the optical radiation of the host
galaxy. The combination of the simultaneous KVA and
Swift-UVOT data allows us to build a good template for
the host galaxy radiation in the optical range of the SED.
Thanks to the set of MAGIC and Fermi-LAT SED
IC
points, we are now able to study the IC peak νpeak
, reported
in Figure B1b. In the HE gamma-ray band, the Fermi-LAT
points present a hard spectral index of ΓHE = 1.67 ± 0.11.
This means that they constitute the rising part of the second SED hump that finally peaks in the TeV gamma-ray
band. For this reason, given the hard gamma-ray spectrum, we fitted the (EBL-deabsorbed) second hump with a
power-law model, reporting a (χ2 /DOF of 5.2/7) and a slope
of 2.13 ± 0.04. Alternatively, the EBL-deabsorbed spectrum
can be fitted also with a power-law model with exponential cut-off (χ2 /DOF of 4/8). This allows for an estimation
IC
of the cut-off νcutoff
1027.2±0.2 Hz, and thus that the second
IC
SED hump peaks at νpeak
= 1026.4±0.6 Hz.
The Compton dominance (CD) parameter for the different models, reported in Table 2, is defined as the ratio between the second hump peak luminosity and the synchrotron
peak luminosity νLν . Considering our estimation of the two
SED peaks, this parameter results in CD ∼ 0.12. This result
is compatible with the phenomenological CD trend observed
for the gamma-ray blazar sample detected by Fermi-LAT
reported in Finke (2013): the higher the frequency of the
synchrotron peak the lower the CD value. The low value
for the CD parameter agrees with the conventional interpretation of poor environments without strong low energy
photon fields around the EHBL relativistic jets preventing
the high-energy emission via EC scattering (contrary to the
rich external fields in FSRQs for instance).

MODELING

Four different emission models have been tested on the experimental data for the emission of the blazar jet. First, we
start with the application of two different one-zone leptonic models. Testing such models, we face the need for applying extremely low magnetization within the emission region. Therefore, we use two different approaches to try to
overcome this problem: a two-zone leptonic model and a
hadronic model.
In addition, the template for a typical host galaxy
contribution is applied to the broad-band SED following Silva et al. (1998), adapted to the redshift of
2WHSP J073326.7+515354 (z=0.065). It is worth to note
that this model represents only a reference model for the
host galaxy emission, and is not fitted to the data. Differences between the model and some archival data might be
due to different apertures adopted by the different instruments, or specific observing conditions, but no detailed information about this is available in the database.

The MAGIC Collaboration

Any conclusion based on the comparison between the model
and the data would require much more careful analysis beyond our scope.
Given that no significant variability is observed in the
source (see Section 3), we fix the emitting region size to
R = 1016 cm (a typical value for HBLs).
Finally, considering that electrons and positrons cannot
be distinguished from a radiative perspective, we will refer
to both populations as electrons.

5.1
5.1.1

One-zone leptonic models
Synchrotron self-Compton model

The synchrotron self-Compton model is the standard
one-zone leptonic model historically used to model the MWL
emission of BL Lac type objects (e.g., Maraschi et al. 1992;
Tavecchio et al. 1998). In this scenario, the emission is produced by relativistic electrons contained in a spherical region
of radius R = 1016 cm with a tangled and uniform magnetic
field B. This region is moving with a bulk Lorentz factor Γ
along the axis of a relativistic jet, which forms an angle θ
with respect to the observer line of sight. The special relativistic effects are accounted for by the relativistic Doppler
factor δ = [Γ(1 − β cos θ)]−1 . The model assumes the presence of a population of relativistic electrons of density N
distributed with a broken power-law spectrum as a function
of the Lorentz factor of the electrons:

γ p1 −p2
N (γ) = K γ −p1 1 +
,
γb
where K is the normalization factor, and p1 and p2 are the
spectral indices respectively before and after the spectral
break, at which the Lorentz factor of the electrons is γb .
Electrons produce synchrotron radiation that is in turn
Compton-scattered generating the high-energy SSC continuum. As detailed in Tavecchio et al. (1998), this simple
model is fully constrained if a good sampling of the SED
(especially around the peaks) and an estimate of the variability timescale are available. The good dataset collected for
2WHSP J073326.7+515354 is therefore quite suitable for the
application of this model in Figure 6a and provides strong
constraints on the physical parameters of the jet, reported
in Table 2.
By applying the SSC model to the data, we can provide
sync
an estimation of the synchrotron peak located at νpeak
=
18
IC
10 Hz (' 4.0 keV) and an IC peak located at νpeak =
1026.4 Hz (' 1.2 TeV). These values are in agreement with
the observational fits we reported in Section 4.

5.1.2

1D conical jet model

The MWL SED has been modeled also adopting the numerical code by Asano et al. (2014a) (see also Asano & Hayashida
2015, 2018), reporting the results in Figure 6b. This model
calculates the emission from the non-thermal electrons in a
conical jet. The evolution of the electron and the photon energy distributions are followed along the motion of the jet.
This framework is similar to the BLAZAR code by Moderski
et al. (2003), which has been frequently adopted to reproduce blazar spectra (see e.g. Kataoka et al. 2008; Hayashida
”
et al. 2012).

The conical expansion of the jet naturally leads to adiabatic cooling of the electrons. This effect resembles the electron escape in one-zone steady models, that can thus be
neglected in this 1-D code. The model assumes a continuous injection of non-thermal electrons from the initial radius
R = R0 during the dynamical timescale R0 /cΓ in the plasma
rest frame. In this timescale, the injection rate into a given
volume V - which is expanding as V ∝ R2 - is assumed to be
constant. The magnetic field B in the plasma frame evolves
as B = B0 (R0 /R). We take into account the synchrotron
and inverse Compton scattering with the Klein-Nishina effect, the γ-γ-absorption, the secondary pair injection, the
synchrotron self-absorption, and the adiabatic cooling.
The electron energy distribution at injection is assumed
as a broken power-law with exponential cut-off, where the
parameters are low-energy index p1 , high-energy index p2 ,
and the break energy (Lorentz factor) γbr and the cut-off
energy γmax . The minimum Lorentz factor γmin is fixed as
20. The electron energy distribution and the photon emission are computed even after electron injection ends, until
R reaches R = 10 R0 .
In this paper, considering an on-axis observer (viewing
angle θv is zero), the jet opening angle is assumed to be 1/Γ,
where Γ is the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet. The photon flux
is obtained by integrating the emission over the entire jet,
taking into account the Doppler boosting by the conically
outflowing emission region.
For the steady emission scenario, this model includes
eight parameters: the initial radius R0 , the bulk Lorentz
factor Γ, the initial magnetic field B0 , the electron Luminosity Le , p1 , p2 , γbr , and γmax . The results are summarized
in Table 2. The model provides a particularly low magnetic
field B, and this puts the object far from the equipartition
limit by more than five orders of magnitude.
The modeling provides also an estimated synchrotron
sync
peak frequency νpeak
= 1018 Hz (' 4.0 keV) and an IC peak
IC
26.5
frequency νpeak = 10
Hz (' 1.25 TeV). These values are
well in agreement with the observational fits we reported in
Section 4.

5.2

The energy equipartition issue

In Table 2, we summarize the resulting parameters for the
first two one-zone leptonic models we used. An inspection
of the table shows that the parameters are quite similar in
both the SSC model and the 1D conical jet model. Both the
models present a low magnetic field B of the order of 10−2
G. The low magnetic field - together with a relatively large
Doppler factor - is generally required by the SSC modeling
in order to account for the large separation between the
two SED peaks. Since the total electron energy for p1 >
2 is dominated by low-energy electrons, a harder electron
spectrum (p1 < 2) well below the energy responsible for
the synchrotron peak would make it close to equipartition.
A stochastic acceleration model (e.g., Asano et al. 2014b)
can generate such a hard spectrum. Dermer et al. (2015)
succeeded in reproducing a relation between the spectral
index and the peak Compton frequency in blazars with an
equipartition model adopting log-parabola electron energy
distribution motivated by the stochastic acceleration model.
Even with their model, however, the broad-band spectrum

Table 2: Resulting values of the parameters used by the three leptonic models in the paper. We report the bulk Lorentz factor
Γ, the magnetic field B, and the electron luminosity Le . The electron distribution is assumed to have an index of p1 between
γmin and γbr , and an index of p2 up to the maximum γmax . Then, we report the Compton dominance parameter CD (the ratio
of νLν at εsyn,pk to that at εIC,pk ), and the energy density ratio of the magnetic field to that of the non-thermal electron
distribution (UB /Ue ) at the radius where the electron injection terminates.
of Mrk 501 requires a low magnetization. It may be difficult
to make it close to the equipartition for EHBLs even with
stochastic acceleration models within one-one or 1D SSC
picture (see Asano & Hayashida 2015).
Another common feature of the modeling results is the
high value of the minimum energy of the electrons γmin
(Katarzynski et al. 2006). The extreme values obtained by
our models for these parameters might be in tension with
those commonly adopted to describe standard HBL via
SSC emission. Their values are instead in agreement with
the ones commonly required in the modelling of the extreme counterpart of this class of sources, the EHBL objects
(Tavecchio et al. 2010, but see also Cerruti et al. 2015 for a
comparison of some results on the modeling of other known
EHBLs).
In the one-zone leptonic framework, both the standard
stationary one-zone model and the 1D conical jet model imply an extremely low magnetic field B of the emitting region
that results in a low ratio of the energy densities UB /Ue ,
being far from the equipartition limit. Such conditions are
particularly interesting considering that they are not related
to flaring episodes of the source, but to their relatively quiescent observed emission. This means that, in the case of
leptonic scenarios, a mechanism is expected to continuously
keep the emission out of equipartition.
In order to increase the UB /Ue ratio, a solution is to
decrease the number of radiating electrons and increase the
minimum Lorentz factor γmin . Another way would be to
modify the size of the emitting region. A larger size of the
emitting region R and smaller Doppler factors δ may be an
alternative solution, but these ad-hoc values would not help
enough in bringing the conditions much closer to equipartition, accounting only for few times closer, and not orders of
magnitude (e.g., Costamante et al. 2018).
Alternative solutions that require less extreme parameters are proposed in the following sections: a spine-layer
structured jet and a hadronic model.

5.3.1

Two-zone model
Spine-layer model

As shown above, the one-zone models applied to the data
of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 suggest that the emission region is quite far from equipartition, with the electron energy
density dominating over that of the magnetic field by more
than 3 orders of magnitude. As discussed by Tavecchio &
Ghisellini (2016), this result is commonly found for one-zone
MNRAS 000, 1–15 (2019)

models of high-energy emitting BL Lacs (see also Inoue &
Tanaka 2016). The same authors show that a possible solution allowing equipartition conditions for the emitting region is the spine-layer model introduced by Ghisellini et al.
(2005). In this framework, the relativistic jet is supposed to
be structured, as suggested by several theoretical and observational hints (e.g., Tavecchio & Ghisellini 2015 for details).
Besides the emission from blazars, the scenario can satisfactorily reproduce the emission of radiogalaxies (Tavecchio &
Ghisellini 2008), and can potentially account for the neutrino production in BL Lac objects (Ansoldi et al. 2018).
Specifically, the jet is supposed to consist of two components: a central fast spine and a slower layer around it.
The former moves with Lorentz factor Γspine = 10 − 20 in
the inner part of the cylindrical jet, while the external layer
has Γlayer = 2 − 5 (Chhotray et al. 2017). The layer acts as a
source of soft (synchrotron) photons that, thanks to boosting due to the relative motion of the two jet components,
can dominate the radiation energy density in the frame of
the spine. In these conditions, the inverse Compton emission from the spine is dominated by the scattering of the
layer radiation field, while the SSC component is expected
to provide a minor contribution. Due to the larger Lorentz
factor, at small angles (such as those characterizing blazars)
the spine emission prevails over that of the layer.
In Figure 6c, we report the model obtained within
the spine-layer framework. The IC emission of the spine is
largely dominated by the scattering of the layer radiation
field. The parameters for the spine (analogous to those describing the one-zone model above) are reported in Table 2.
The introduction of a more complex structure of the jet
allows a more relaxed fit of the physical parameters. The
spine-layer scheme offers an increased energy density of the
radiation field (supposed to be dominated by the radiation
provided by the layer), and this allows us to lower the electron density needed to produce a given IC luminosity. In
turn, in order to account for the reduced number of electrons, the model slightly increases the magnetic field B to
keep the same synchrotron luminosity. This fact increases
the previous UB /Ue ratio and brings it closer the equipartition limit, reconciling it with the theoretical expectations.
Also adopting lower values of γmin confirms our results concerning the energy densities close to equipartition in this
model: for example, γmin = 10 implies UB /Ue = 0.1, that
still represents an acceptable value.
The structured jet model provides more appropriate
physical conditions closer to equipartition, and leads to an

12

interesting comparison with its application to the sample of
hard-TeV blazars reported in Costamante et al. (2018). In
fact, the spine-layer model can provide larger magnetic field
that generates a more efficient cooling of the TeV electrons,
providing a softer spectrum at TeV energies that does not
agree with the hard spectrum up to several TeV of the hardTeV blazars seen in Costamante et al. (2018).
However, such a softer spectrum at TeV energies is observed in more “standard” HBL-like EHBLs, like for example 2WHSP J073326.7+515354. This source, according to
the results in gamma rays previously found, is an EHBL
object that presents an IC peak well detectable at few
TeV. This implies that the spine-layer model is still able
to fit the SED (especially the IC peak). Thus, the case
of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 might be a limit-case in the
EHBL population with a high synchrotron peak but not extremely hard TeV gamma-ray spectrum. This result confirms the great difference that might be hidden in the EHBL
population due to different spectral properties in the TeV
gamma-ray band. Further observations at TeV energies will
be able to increase the statistics and characterize new objects of this population.
Applying this model to the data, it provides the synsync
chrotron peak located at νpeak
= 1018 Hz (' 4.1 keV) and
IC
an IC peak located at νpeak = 1026.5 Hz (' 1.25 TeV). These
values are in good agreement with the observational fits we
reported in Section 4.

5.4

Hadronic model

Another solution in order to interpret the SED of
2WHSP J073326.7+515354 without using extreme physical parameters can be found considering a hadronic origin
for the gamma-ray component. Blazar hadronic models, in
which the gamma-ray component is ascribed to emission
by protons in the jet, or by secondary leptons produced
in p-gamma interactions, have been widely studied (e.g.,
Mannheim 1993; Aharonian 2000; Mucke & Protheroe 2001;
Boettcher et al. 2013) as an alternative to leptonic models. One of the major drawbacks of this scenario is that it
often requires a high proton power, well above the Eddington luminosity of the black hole powering the blazar. For the
particular case of EHBLs on the other hand, due to their relatively low luminosity compared to other blazar subclasses,
a successful hadronic modeling can be achieved with an acceptable energy budget (see Cerruti et al. 2015). In addition,
the absence of fast flares from EHBLs (in contrast with the
γ-ray variability seen in more common HBLs) is also consistent with the cooling time-scales of protons in the jet. With
this scenario in mind, we test a simple proton synchrotron
model for 2WHSP J073326.7+515354, using the numerical
code described in Cerruti et al. (2015). We make the following assumptions to reduce the number of free parameters to
study:
• electrons and protons share the same acceleration process, and thus the index α of the injected energy distribution
is identical;
• the maximum proton Lorentz factor γp,max is constrained by the equality of cooling and acceleration timescales; for the parameters used in the model, the fastest
cooling time-scale for protons is the adiabatic one;

• the electron energy distribution at equilibrium is calculated assuming that electrons are cooled primarily by synchrotron radiation;
• the emitting region size R is limited by the variability
time scale, which is considered to be two days
• the Doppler factor δ of the emitting region is fixed to
30.
Under these assumptions, we produce 350 hadronic models
scanning the following parameter space: the radius of the
emitting region R ∈ [1014 cm − 1.46 × 1017 cm], the proton
peak synchrotron frequency νp,syn ∈ [4 × 1024 − 4 × 1026 ]
Hz, and the proton normalization Kp ∈ [K ? /3, 3K ? ], where
K ? corresponds to the proton density such that the peak
of the proton synchrotron component is at the level of the
MAGIC data. A χ2 test is used to select the solutions which
correspond to a 1 σ C.L., obtaining a best χ2 /DOF of 46/42.
The proton-synchrotron models which describe the SED are
shown in Figure 6d and the corresponding model parameters
are reported in Table 3.
Hadronic solutions are thus a viable alternative to leptonic ones, and can be achieved with acceptable values for
the Doppler factor (equal to 30) and the jet luminosity
(which can be as low as 2 × 1045 erg s−1 , that is about 0.01
× LEdd for a typical supermassive black hole mass of 109 solar masses). The emitting region in this case is extremely out
of equipartition, being dominated by the magnetic energy
density with UB /Up ' 0.9 − 120 × 103 . The well known degeneracy in the synchrotron radiation spectrum implies that
the parameters of the emitting region cannot be constrained,
and indeed all studied values of the size of the emitting region from Rmin = 1014 cm, to Rmax = 1.46 × 1017 cm can
provide a good solution. The same is true for the values of
the magnetic field, which can take any value between 1.2 and
46.8 G. The only parameter which takes unusual values is
the index of the injected particle population, α = 1.3: such
a hard injection index is not consistent with standard shock
acceleration, although it can be achieved, if particles are accelerated via magnetic reconnection (Sironi & Spitkovsky
2014). On the other hand, it is important to underline that
this value does not come from the SED fitting, but is a direct consequence of the two assumptions on co-acceleration
of electrons and protons, and that only synchrotron and adiabatic cooling terms shape the stationary particle distribution. Removing one of these assumptions (or both) can lead
to softer particle injection indices still in agreement with the
observations.
The hadronic model provides an estimated synchrotron
sync
peak located at νpeak
= 1018 Hz (' 4.1 keV) and a gammaray peak located at νpeak = 2 − 4 1025 Hz (' 0.25 TeV).
The latter range of values represents the result for the bestfit solutions whose χ2 is dominated by the Fermi-LAT data.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we provide the results of the TeV gammaray discovery of the EHBL 2WHSP J073326.7+515354. This
source has been observed during 2018 with the MAGIC telescopes, which reported a firm detection after about 23 hours
of observations. Simultaneous data have been collected also
in the optical, UV, soft X-ray, and HE gamma-ray bands.

luminosity of the emitting region has been calculated as
L = 2πR2 cΓ2bulk (uB + ue + up ), where Γbulk = δ/2, and
uB , ue , and up , the energy densities of the magnetic field,
the electrons, and the protons, respectively. The quantities
flagged with a star (? ) are derived quantities, and not model
parameters.
This allowed us to build a well-sampled broad-band SED of
the source. Thanks to the new data for this source, we were
also able to perform a new estimation of the synchrotron
peak and IC peak positions. This leads us to confirm the
classification of this source as an EHBL object but showing
a softer spectrum at gamma rays compared to the “hardTeV” EHBLs like for example 1ES 0229+200.
The broad-band SED has been fitted with four different
models: three leptonic and one hadronic. The results of leptonic SSC models, whether considering electron acceleration
in a spherical plasmoid or in the whole conical expansion of
the jet, substantially agree on the extreme spectral parameters needed to fit the SED of this source. The high Doppler
factor δ, the low magnetic field B of the emitting region, and
the minimum Lorentz factor γmin , are common resulting parameters. However, for the one-zone leptonic framework an
extremely low magnetization is required, in both models being very far from equipartition. In order to overcome this
problem, two different approaches are used: a two zone leptonic model (spine-layer), and a hadronic scenario. While the
one-zone leptonic models result in a ratio between the energy density of the particles and the magnetic field (Ue /UB )
of several orders of magnitude, the spine-layer model results
in a value close to the theoretical expectations. Another interesting point is that equipartition is not reachable with
the spine-layer model in other EHBLs like the “hard-TeV”
blazars (e.g., 1ES 0229+200), and this implies that this object might represent an exception or a transitional case in
the EHBL class where the spectral properties are sufficiently
extreme but the equipartition regime still holds with respect
to hard-TeV blazars (compare with Costamante et al. 2018).

est variability make the application of hadronic modeling
successful with reasonable physical parameters. Therefore,
in addition to the leptonic models, we presented another
model by including a hadronic contribution to the emission
mechanism. While the hadronic scenario is able to produce
a plausible fit to the MWL SED, the opposite problem for
equipartition with respect to one-zone leptonic models is
found. The parameter space able to fit the SED results in a
ratio UB /Ue far from equipartition, with the jet highly magnetized in this case. For all the models we tested, we ignored
the cascade emission by pairs produced in the interaction of
TeV photons with the EBL. Emission from these pairs could
emerge in the MeV-GeV part of the spectrum if pairs are
not isotropized by the intergalactic magnetic field, or if they
do not loose energy via other mechanisms. Such an emission,
although predicted theoretically, has never been observed so
far in any gamma-ray blazar, indicating that, if it exists, it
is likely sub-dominant with respect to the emission from the
source itself. Finally, considering that the simple one-zone
SSC model already provides a good description of the SED,
more complex models (including hadronic component, e.g.
a photo-meson model similar to that discussed in MAGIC
Collaboration et al. 2018) could only provide second order
effects.
In conclusion, while the four SED modeling scenarios can provide compatible models for the MWL SED of
2WHSP J073326.7+515354, extreme physical parameters
would be required for three of them. The model that better
matches with the theoretical predictions is the spine-layer
scenario, which provides a reasonable framework to explain
the broad-band SED.
The case of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354, is an important example of the key role that the TeV gamma-ray band
plays in the characterization of EHBLs. New observations of
this class of sources by Cherenkov telescopes will allow to
increase the number of objects in this population. The forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory, with
its improved sensitivity in this energy band, will be critical
in discovering new TeV EHBLs and will help in disclosing
the physical phenomena behind their extreme spectral emission.

105-months catalogue (Oh et al. 2018) data (dark red
dots) .

Table A1: Flux (points and 95% C.L. upper limits) and effective observing time of the source 2WHSP J073326.7+515354
registered by the MAGIC telescopes.
APPENDIX A: OBSERVATION TABLES
In this Appendix, the tables including the MWL observation
results are included. The nightly fluxes obtained in the VHE
band as observed by MAGIC telescopes are given in Table A1. The 2-year fluxes obtained in the HE band with the
Fermi-LAT telescope are reported in Table A2. In Table A3
and Table A4 we report the information from all the observations of the source with the Swift-XRT and Swift-UVOT
instruments, respectively. The details from the optical observations from KVA telescope are reported in Table A5.

model from Dominguez et al. (2011). A power-law
with an exponential cut-off is used to fit the FermiLAT data (red circles) and the MAGIC data (blue
circles)

Figure B1: Synchrotron (a) and (b) IC hump of
2WHSP J073326.7+515354.
APPENDIX B: ESTIMATION OF THE
BROAD-BAND SED PEAK FREQUENCY
The frequencies at which the peaks of the MWL SED are
located are crucial for the classification of the target. For
the case of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354, the low energy peak
is characterized by means of the Swift-XRT and Swift-BAT
spectra. The high energy peak instead is characterized by
the gamma-ray observations from Fermi-LAT and MAGIC.
The SEDs can be found in Figure B1.

Table A3: Results of Swift-XRT data analysis for the observations of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354. We report for each observation the MJD, the exposure obtained by XRT, and the two integral fluxes between 2-10 keV and 0.3-10 keV. Every
individual spectrum can be well fitted by a power-law function with spectral index ΓX and good reduced χ2 . In addition to
the simultaneous observations with MAGIC, the results from historical observations are also included for comparison purposes.

Table A4: Results of Swift-UV data analysis for the observations of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354. We report the energy band
of the UVOT instrument, the date and MJD of the observation, the integral flux, and the compatibility between each value
and the average flux for only 2018 data simultaneous to MAGIC observations. The compatibility has been computed as
λ = √|A−B|
, for a given two fluxes with values A and B and their respective uncertainties (σA and σB ). where for example

σA +σB

A is a flux value and B is the average flux reported in the text.
