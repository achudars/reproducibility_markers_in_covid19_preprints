Abstract. In this present work, we study the scattering of a pseudoscalar meson off one ground state octet baryon in covariant baryon
chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-next-to-leading order. We
remove the power counting breaking terms with the extended-on-massshell scheme. We perform the first combined study of the pion-nucleon
and kaon-nucleon scattering data and show that the covariant baryon
Chiral perturbation theory can provide a reasonable description of the
experimental data for both channels.
Keywords: meson-baryon scattering, extend-on-mass-shell scheme, covariant BChPT

Introduction

Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), as a low-energy effective field theory of
QCD, plays an important role in our understanding of the non-perturbative
strong interactions [1]. Elastic meson-baryon scattering is a fundamental process
that not only can test our understanding of the strong interaction but also
plays a relevant role in the studies of the properties of single and multi baryons.
Because of the large nonzero baryon masses m0 in the chiral limit, lower order
analytical terms appear in nominal higher order loop calculations, and therefore
a consistent power counting is lost [2]. In the past three decades, several solutions
have been proposed. The most studied ones are the heavy baryon ChPT [3,4],
the infrared (IR) baryon ChPT [5], and the extended-on-mass-shell (EOMS)
BChPT [6,7]. Among them, the EOMS BChPT turns out to be more appealing
because it satisfies all the symmetry and analyticity constraints and converges
relatively faster [8,9].
In this talk, we present our work on meson-baryon scattering up to next-tonext-to-leading order in the EOMS scheme.

Theoretical Formalism

In the isospin limit, the standard decomposition of the meson-baryon scattering
amplitude reads [2],


i

TMB = u(p , s ) D +

where the p(p′ ) and q(q ′ ) are the momentum for initial (final) baryons and
mesons, respectively.
In order to calculate the meson-baryon scattering amplitudes up to the leading one-loop order, i.e., O(p3 ), we need the following meson-meson and mesonbaryon Lagrangians:

It should be noted that not all of the remaining O(p2 ) and O(p3 ) terms
contribute to a specific process. Particularly, for pion-nucleon and kaon-nucleon
scattering, only 24 out of the total 37 LECs contribute. They are tabulated in
Table. 2.
Because the baryon mass at chiral limit does not vanish, the power counting
rules are violated [2]. Within the EOMS scheme, as shown in Ref. [7], these
power counting breaking terms are all analytic and can be absorbed into low
energy constants. Thus in the present work, we apply the M S − 1 first to absorb
the ultraviolet divergence and then the EOMS scheme to remove the PCB terms
to restore the power counting rules.

Fitting and Results

In the present work we focus on the πN and KN channels, because only for
these channels partial wave phase shifts are available.

With the amplitudes properly renormalized, we determined the LECs by fitting to the partial wave phase shifts from the analysis of WI08 [13] for πN . And
correspondingly, the phase-shift analysis of the SP92 solution [14] are used for
KN . The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The corresponding fit
results are compared with the empirical data in both figures. For the sake of comparison, we show as well the O(p3 ) results of the SU(3) heavy baryon(HB) [16]
and the SU(2) EOMS BChPT [15].
Clearly, the EOMS results can
√ describe the phase shifts quite well. While
s = 1.13GeV, the phase shifts are described
the data are only fitted
up
to
√
very well even up to s = 1.16GeV. Besides, our calculation in SU(3) shows
a compatible description compared to that in SU(2), which implies that the
inclusion of strangeness has small effects on the fitting results. For the KN
scattering, a quite good description of the phase shifts can already be achieved
at NLO. We found that in the EOMS ChPT, the phase shifts alone cannot
uniquely fix the eight LECs up to O(p3 ). For the sake of comparison, we show
as well the HB results of Refs. [16]. It is clear that the EOMS descriptions are
slightly better that the HB results when extended to higher energy region.

WI08 solutions. For the sake of comparison, we show as well the EOMS SU(2) results [15] (green dot-dashed lines) and the HB SU(3) results [16] (red dashed lines).

Summary

In this talk, we present our results on meson-baryon scattering up to nextto-next-to-leading order in the framework of covariant ChPT with the EOMS
scheme. We determined the LECs by fitting to the partial wave phase shifts from
GWU group. We achieved a pretty good description for πN and KN channels
simulatively. Compared with those in HB scheme, our results in πN channels
are much better, while in KN channels, the improvements are not significant as
in πN cases.
