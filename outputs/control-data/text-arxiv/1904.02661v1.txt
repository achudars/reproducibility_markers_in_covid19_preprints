Abstract
In a proper edge-coloring of a cubic graph an edge uv is called poor or rich, if the set of
colors of the edges incident to u and v contains exactly three or five colors, respectively. An
edge-coloring of a graph is normal, if any edge of the graph is either poor or rich. In this
note, we show that some snarks constructed by using a method introduced by Loupekhine
admit a normal edge-coloring with five colors. The existence of a Berge-Fulkerson Covering
for a part of the snarks considered in this paper was recently proved by Manuel and Shanthi
(2015). Since the existence of a normal edge-coloring with five colors implies the existence
of a Berge-Fulkerson Covering, our main theorem can be viewed as a generalization of their
result.

1. Introduction
In graph theory the Petersen coloring conjecture asserts that the edges of every bridgeless
cubic graph G can be colored by using as set of colors the edge-set of the Petersen graph
P , such that adjacent edges of G are colored with adjacent edges of P . The conjecture is
well-known and is considered hard to prove as it implies classical conjectures in the field such
as the Berge-Fulkerson conjecture and the Cycle Double Cover conjecture (see [5, 8, 19]).
Jaeger in [8] introduced an equivalent formulation of the Petersen coloring conjecture. More
precisely, he showed that a bridgeless cubic graph satisfies this conjecture, if and only if,
it admits a normal edge-coloring with at most five colors (see exact definitions later). Let
χ′N (G) denote the minimum number of colors in a normal edge-coloring of G. Usually, it
is called the normal chromatic index of G. In this terms, the Petersen coloring conjecture
amounts to proving that every bridgeless cubic graph has normal chromatic index at most
five. To the best of our knowledge, the smallest known upper bound for χ′N (G) in an
arbitrary bridgeless cubic graph is 7 (see [2, 12]). The situation is similar in the larger class
of all simple cubic graphs (not necessarily bridgeless): there are cubic graphs with normal

chromatic index 7, on the other hand, in [12] two of the authors have shown that any
simple cubic graph admits a normal 7-edge-coloring. One may wonder whether the upper
bound 7 can be improved in other interesting subclasses of cubic graphs. Related with this
question, in this paper we show that a class of snarks obtained with a method introduced by
Loupekhine, admits a normal edge-coloring with five colors. Let us remark that this result
implies the main result in [11].
Now, let us give the all necessary definitions and notions used in the paper. We consider
finite and undirected graphs. They do not contain neither loops nor parallel edges.
For a graph G, the set of vertices and edges of G are denoted by V (G) and E(G),
respectively. Let ∂G (v) be the set of edges of G that are incident to the vertex v of G.
Assume that G and H are two cubic graphs. If there is a mapping φ : E(G) → E(H), such
that for each v ∈ V (G) there is w ∈ V (H) such that φ(∂G (v)) = ∂H (w), then we refer to φ
as an H-coloring of G. If G admits an H-coloring, then we write H ≺ G.

Figure 1: The graph P10 .

Let P10 be the Petersen graph (Figure 1). The Petersen coloring conjecture of Jaeger
states:
Conjecture 1. (Jaeger, 1988 [9]) For any bridgeless cubic graph G, we have P10 ≺ G.
It is shown in [13] that the Petersen graph is the only connected, bridgeless cubic graph
that can color all bridgeless cubic graphs. The conjecture is difficult to prove, since it implies
the classical Berge-Fulkerson conjecture [5, 18] and (5,2)-cycle-cover conjecture [3, 15]. For
our aim, we only need to recall the statement of the former one.
Conjecture 2. (Berge-Fulkerson, 1972 ) Any bridgeless cubic graph G contains six (not
necessarily distinct) perfect matchings such that any edge of G belongs to exactly two of
them.
We will call Berge-Fulkerson Covering of G any set of six perfect matchings which satisfy
the condition in Conjecture 2.
2. Normal 5-edge-colorings
A k-edge-coloring of a graph G is an assignment of colors {1, ..., k} to edges of G, such
that adjacent edges receive different colors. For an edge-coloring c of G and a vertex v of
G, let Sc (v) be the set of colors that edges incident to v receive.
2

Definition 1. Assume that uv is an edge of a cubic graph G, and let c be an edge-coloring
of G. We say that the edge uv is poor or rich with respect to c, if |Sc (u) ∪ Sc (v)| = 3 or
|Sc (u) ∪ Sc (v)| = 5, respectively. An edge is normal (with respect to c) if it is poor or rich.
Edge-colorings in which all edges are poor are trivially 3-edge-colorings of G. On the
other hand, edge-colorings having only rich edges have been considered before, and they are
called strong edge-colorings [1]. In the present paper, we focus on the case when all edges
must be normal.
Definition 2. An edge-coloring c of a cubic graph is normal, if any edge is normal with
respect to c.
In [8], Jaeger has shown that:
Proposition 1. (Jaeger, [8]) Let G be any cubic graph. Then P10 ≺ G, if and only if G
admits a normal 5-edge-coloring.
This implies that Conjecture 1 can be re-stated in the following way:
Conjecture 3. For any bridgeless cubic graph G, χ′N (G) ≤ 5.
Our previous considerations imply that Conjecture 3 holds for 3-edge-colorable cubic
graphs. This means that the non-3-edge-colorable cubic graphs are the main obstacle for
proving Conjecture 3. Let us note that in [6] Conjecture 3 is verified for some non-3-edgecolorable bridgeless cubic graphs. Also, in [16] the percentage of edges of a bridgeless cubic
graph, which can be made normal in a 5-edge-coloring, is estimated.
The following well-known result says that Conjecture 3 implies Conjecture 2.
Proposition 2. Let G be a bridgeless cubic graph. If G admits a normal 5-edge-coloring,
then it admits a Berge-Fulkerson covering.
Proof. (Sketch) The existence of a normal 5-edge-coloring is equivalent to the existence of
a Petersen Coloring φ : E(G) → E(P ) of G. The preimages of the six distinct perfect
matchings of P give a Berge-Fulkerson covering of G (see also [13]).
3. Loupekhine snarks
In many contexts, among all non-3-edge-colorable cubic graphs, ones with some additional restrictions are more studied in order to avoid trivial cases. Even if there are many
interesting definitions of what non-trivial could mean (see for instance [4, 14]), here we stick
to the largely used definition of snark as a non-3-edge-colorable cyclically 4-edge-connected
cubic graph of girth at least 5.
A classical method to construct snarks was proposed by Loupekhine in early 70s and it
appears firstly in a paper of Isaacs in 1976 (see [7]).
Here, we recall the general method and we focus our attention on some families of snarks
which can be constructed by using such a method. In particular, we will make use of the
same terminology and notations in [10].
3

Let G be a snark. We denote by B(G) any induced subgraph of G obtained by removing
the three vertices of a path of length 2 in G. Since G has girth at least 5, the subgraph
B(G) has exactly 5 vertices of degree 2, while every other vertex has degree equal to 3.
Let G1 , G2 , . . . , Gk be arbitrary snarks. Consider the disjoint union of the k graphs
Bi = B(Gi ). For all i = 1, . . . , k, add two new edges between two of the vertices of degree
2 in Bi with two of the vertices of degree 2 in Bi+1 (indices larger than k are taken modulo
k) in such a way that the set of these new edges is a matching in the resulting graph GB
k.
B
C
The new graph Gk has exactly k vertices of degree 2, say w1 , w2 , . . . , wk . Let Gk be a
graph with exactly k vertices of degree one, say z1 , z2 , . . . , zk , and all other vertices of degree
3.
C
If we identify every vertex wi of GB
k with a vertex zi of Gk , we obtain a cubic graph,
denoted by GLk .
Proposition 3. ([7]) If k odd, then GLk is a snark.
All snarks obtained with the method described in previous proposition are known as
Loupekhine snarks, or L-snarks.
Definition 3. Let G be an L-snark.
• If every connected component of GC
k is either an isolated edge or a star with three
vertices of degree 1, then G is said to be an L1 -snark.
• If every subgraph Bi is isomorphic to B(P ) (see Figure 2), where P is the Petersen
graph, then G is said to be an LP -snark.
• An LP1 -snark is a snark which is both an L1 -snark and an LP -snark.
In [11], the authors prove that a very special family of LP1 -snarks admits a BergeFulkerson covering. In the next section, we strongly generalize their result by proving the
existence of a normal 5-edge-coloring for a larger class of LP1 -snarks which properly contains
the class of LP1 -snarks studied in [11]. Hence, by Proposition 2, we have that all of them
admit also a Berge-Fulkerson covering.
4. Main result
Now we construct a normal 5-edge-colorings for a class of LP1 -snarks. Later, we will
prove that our class properly contains all snarks considered in [11].
For any odd k, let GLk be an LP1 -snark, and, as described in Section 3, we consider its
C
L
B
decomposition in the two subgraphs GB
k and Gk . Recall that, since Gk is an LP1 -snark, Gk
is the disjoint union of copies of B(P ) and every connected component of GC
k is either K2
or a star with four vertices.
Firstly, we construct a normal 5-edge-coloring of GB
k . We consider the k consecutive
copies of B(P ), say B1 , . . . , Bk , and we subdivide them in three subsequences B1 , . . . , Br ,
Br+1 , . . . , Br+s and Br+s+1 , . . . , Bk with r and s odd. Note that all the three subsequences
have an odd number of copies of B(P ) since k is also odd.

k

By a direct check, the defined coloring is normal for each of the previous subgraphs and it
remains normal also when we consider the entire subgraph GB
k . Moreover, all the k vertices
of degree 2 are incident to edges with colors 1 and 2.
Now, consider a subgraph GC
k which satisfies the additional property that every copy
of K2 connects two vertices of GB
k in the same subsequence.
C
Color every edge of Gk incident a vertex of the first subsequence with the color 3,
incident a vertex of the second subsequence with the color 4 and incident a vertex of the
third subsequence with the color 5.
For all GC
k which satisfy the additional constraint, the presented coloring is a normal
5-edge-coloring of GLk . Then, we are now in position to state our main result.
Theorem 1. Let GLk be an LP1 -snark and let B1 . . . Bk be the k blocks in GB
k . If the k
blocks can be partitioned in three subsequences of odd length in such a way that every copy
B
L
of K2 in GC
k connects two vertices of Gk in the same subsequence, then Gk admits a normal
5-edge-coloring.
Now, let us show that the class of LP1 -snarks presented in [11] satisfy the assumptions
of Theorem 1.
For any odd k, the LP1 -snark considered in [11] is the one having the following decomB
position in GC
k and Gk .
The subgraph GC
k has a unique star and denote its three vertices of degree one by
z1 , z⌊k/2⌋+1 and z⌊k/2⌋+2 . Moreover, each copy of K2 connects pairwise the vertices zi+2 , zk−i ,
for i = 0, . . . ⌊k/2⌋ − 2.
We use the same patterns of coloring in Figures 3, 4, 5 where B⌊k/2⌋+3 , ..., B1 , ...B⌊k/2⌋
is the first subsequence, the unique block B⌊k/2⌋+1 gives the second subsequence and the
unique block B⌊k/2⌋+2 is the third one.
Hence, every element of this family of LP1 -snarks satisfies the assumptions of Theorem
1 and then it is contained in our larger class of LP1 -snarks.
4.1. Loupekhine snarks of the second type
Here we briefly explain how we can slightly modify the coloring presented above in order
to exhibit a normal 5−edge-coloring also for the class of Loupekhine snarks of the second
6

kind [17]. First of all, let us define this class. We will call twist the operation that replace
two edges between two consecutive blocks in GB
k in the way described in Figure 6.
Definition 4. An LP2 -snark is a snark which is obtained by an LP1 -snark with a twist of
the two edges between two consecutive selected blocks.

Figure 6: A twist between two copies of B(P ).

Observe that we do not really construct new examples of snarks if we perform additional
twists between other blocks of the snark so obtained. Indeed, it is easy to prove that an even
number of twists produces a graph isomorphic to the original one. Hence, by applying an
odd number of twists we obtain the same snark obtained by using a unique twist. Moreover,
it is not relevant the pair of blocks where the twist is applied: indeed, given an LP1 -snark
GLk , all LP2 -snarks obtained starting from GLk with a twist between two arbitrary consecutive
blocks are isomorphic.
Hence, without loss of generality, we can always apply the twist to the two edges with
color 3 between the last block in the second subsequence and the first block in the third
subsequence. With such a configuration, we maintain clearly the same pattern of coloring
described before for the entire graph and the following holds.
Theorem 2. Let GLk be an LP2 -snark and let B1 . . . Bk be the k blocks in GB
k . If the k
blocks can be partitioned in three subsequences of odd length in such a way that every copy
B
L
of K2 in GC
k connects two vertices of Gk in the same subsequence, then Gk admits a normal
5-edge-coloring.
We would like to stress that it remains largely open the general problem of proving that
the normal chromatic number of any Loupekhine snark is five, and it is still open even if we
restrict our attention to the class of LP1 -snarks.
