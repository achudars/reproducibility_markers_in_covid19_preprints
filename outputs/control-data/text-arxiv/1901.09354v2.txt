ABSTRACT
We present a detailed guide to advanced collisionless fluid models that incorporate kinetic effects into
the fluid framework, and that are much closer to the collisionless kinetic description than traditional
magnetohydrodynamics. Such fluid models are directly applicable to modeling turbulent evolution
of a vast array of astrophysical plasmas, such as the solar corona and the solar wind, the interstellar medium, as well as accretion disks and galaxy clusters. The text can be viewed as a detailed
guide to Landau fluid models and it is divided into two parts. Part 1 is dedicated to fluid models
that are obtained by closing the fluid hierarchy with simple (non Landau fluid) closures. Part 2 is
dedicated to Landau fluid closures. Here in Part 1, we discuss the CGL fluid model in great detail,
together with fluid models that contain dispersive effects introduced by the Hall term and by the finite
Larmor radius (FLR) corrections to the pressure tensor. We consider dispersive effects introduced
by the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors. We investigate the parallel and oblique firehose instability,
and show that the non-gyrotropic heat flux strongly influences the maximum growth rate of these
instabilities. Furthermore, we discuss fluid models that contain evolution equations for the gyrotropic
heat flux fluctuations and that are closed at the 4th-moment level by prescribing a specific form for
the distribution function. For the bi-Maxwellian distribution, such a closure is known as the “normal” closure. We also discuss a fluid closure for the bi-kappa distribution. Finally, by considering
one-dimensional Maxwellian fluid closures at higher-order moments, we show that such fluid models
are always unstable. The last possible non Landau fluid closure is therefore the “normal” closure, and
beyond the 4th-order moment, Landau fluid closures are required.

1. INTRODUCTION

Fluid models are an extremely important tool in many areas of space physics, astrophysics and laboratory plasmas.
Even though many physical systems studied in these fields are almost collisionless, where a proper kinetic description
should be used, traditional fluid models with isotropic scalar pressures (temperatures), such as the usual magnetohydrodynamic description (MHD) and multi-fluid models based on this description, were extremely successful in
modeling, interpreting, or at least offering the first insight into many space physics phenomena. For example, it was
indeed the simplified fluid approach that allowed Parker (1958) to predict the existence of the solar wind, which was
surprisingly several decades later than the breakthrough discoveries in quantum mechanics and relativity. In recent
years, observational studies re-sparked interest in the temperature anisotropy effects, that cannot be studied with the
usual MHD fluid descriptions, and we anticipate that the interest will grow even further, once data from the Parker
Solar Probe and the future Solar Orbiter missions are analyzed.
The correct modeling and understanding of collisionless plasmas in a fluid framework, does not concern only systems
with plasma temperatures far from an isotropic state. It is sometimes forgotten that while the application of fluid
theory to strongly collisional systems is intuitively obvious, the approach to collisionless (or weakly collisional) systems
is not. From a linear perspective, the usual MHD description does not converge to the collisionless kinetic description
even in the low-frequency long-wavelength limit (even when the kinetic distribution function is considered to be an
isotropic Maxwellian), since in the absence of collisions the isotropic equation of state is never correct. Additionally,
Landau damping never completely vanishes (even when electrons are hot). The situation is much more complicated
from a non-linear perspective, where on average, the effect of Landau damping might be balanced by processes called
stochastic plasma echoes (Meyrand et al. 2019).
As a linear example, the ordering of the phase speeds in MHD is always slow, Alfvén, fast, i.e., vs ≤ vA ≤ vf .
In contrast, in collisionless systems with sufficiently high plasma beta, the real phase speed of the slow mode can
become faster than the Alfvén mode, so that the ordering can become Alfvén, slow, fast, i.e., vA ≤ vs ≤ vf . Or in
another words, the phase speeds of linear eigenmodes that are present in MHD do not hold in the collisionless (or
weakly collisional) regime, and this effect exists even if the temperatures are isotropic. From a fluid perspective, the
main reason for this discrepancy is that in magnetized collisionless systems, the pressure fluctuations in the directions
parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field lines are not equivalent, and cannot be described with a single scalar
pressure equation. The pressure fluctuations have to be described with two different evolution equations for pk and
(0)
(0)
p⊥ , even if the mean pressure values are equal (pk = p⊥ ) and no mean temperature anisotropy exists.
The simplest collisionless fluid description is the CGL fluid model - named after Chew, Goldberger and Low
Chew et al. (1956) - and sometimes also referred to as collisionless MHD. The CGL dispersion relation is not equivalent
(0)
(0)
to the MHD dispersion relation (even in the case pk = p⊥ ), since the pressure fluctuations still remain anisotropic
and the evolution equations for pk and p⊥ remain different. In another words, in collisionless systems the distribution
function is free to evolve from its initial state and to become anisotropic. By “forcibly” prescribing only one scalar
pressure, one effectively prescribes a high-collisionality regime, even if collisions are not prescribed explicitly. Formally,
the MHD equations can indeed be derived from the collisionless Vlasov equation, i.e. with no explicit collisional operator. It is therefore often stated, that the MHD description is highly-collisional implicitly. Moreover, as discussed for
example by Kulsrud (1983), while in the presence of a magnetic field, transverse motions can in some circumstances
be described by fluid-type equations, the determination of pressures as well as longitudinal motions a priori requires
a kinetic description.
Here we focus on collisionless fluid models. Nevertheless, weak collisions can be incorporated easily, and calculations
just yield additional terms on the right hand sides of the parallel and perpendicular pressure and heat flux equations. For the simple Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collisional operator (Bhatnagar et al. 1954), see for example
Snyder et al. (1997). A thorough review of anisotropic fluid models, including the collisional dynamics, was presented
by Barakat & Schunk (1982). A very good discussion about collisionality of various astrophysical plasmas, such as the
solar wind, interstellar medium, accretion disks and galaxy clusters, can be found for example in Schekochihin et al.
(2009). Weakly collisional fluid models also seem to be applicable for modelling the upper solar photosphere and
chromosphere, where a curious situation exists and the proton-proton collisional frequency is roughly equal to the
proton cyclotron frequency - see for example Figure 1 in Khomenko et al. (2014). We note that in this guide we use
the definition of a “collisionless fluid model” as being a fluid model that 1) is derived from collisionless Vlasov equation
with zero right hand side; and 2) that has two different pressure equations. Our definition therefore differs from an
alternative view of for example Zank et al. (2014); Zank (2014), where models with scattering operator that reflects
charged particle scattering by electromagnetic fluctuations on the right hand side of Vlasov equation are also viewed

5
as collisionless.
Fluid modeling of collisionless plasmas is an extremely attractive subject, and an enormous amount of theoretical
and numerical work was done in this field in the past. The manuscript presented here has no intention to be a proper
review paper in this field. In our opinion, no satisfactory easy-to-read introductory paper exists about collisionless
fluid models, and this manuscript attempts to fill such a spot. Instead of just stating the major results and discussing
what was done in the past and by whom, we make a significant effort to present a (hopefully consistent) derivation of
basic collisionless fluid models. On one hand, the presented calculations might be considered as too detailed in many
places. On the other hand, it is exactly the relatively complicated algebra of collisionless fluid models, that makes the
field difficult to enter for new researchers. The primary goal of this paper is to allow researchers new to the subject to
follow the algebra easily. Instead of spending years, an interested reader should be able to get comfortable with the
basics of the subject in a matter of days, or perhaps a couple of weeks. The text is separated to two parts. Part 1
is dedicated to fluid models that are obtained by closing the fluid hierarchy with simple (non Landau fluid) closures.
Part 2 is dedicated to Landau fluid closures.
Here in Part 1, Section 2, we start with the detailed derivation of the pressure tensor equation. The pressure
tensor p is then decomposed to its gyrotropic part pg = pk b̂b̂ + p⊥ (I − b̂b̂) (also referred to as pCGL ), and nongyrotropic part Π, the latter usually called the finite Larmor radius (FLR) corrections to the pressure tensor, or the
gyroviscous stress tensor. In the highly-collisional decomposition p = pI + Π, see e.g. Braginskii (1958, 1965), the
quantity Π is called the stress tensor. The decomposition procedure yields rigorously exact (even though still not
closed) evolution equations for pk and p⊥ , see e.g. Passot & Sulem (2004); Goswami et al. (2005); Oraevskii et al.
(1968). Importantly, at the leading order (by neglecting the Π and also the non-gyrotropic heat flux contributions q ng ),
the equations of Chew et al. (1956), hereafter referred to as CGL, are recovered. We discuss the paper by Chew et al.
(1956) and point out that the paper derived the correct form of the pressure equations with the gyrotropic heat flux
contributions included, however, the quantities qn , qs used in that paper are related to the usual qk , q⊥ by relations
qn = qk − 3q⊥ and qs = q⊥ . By further neglecting the heat flux contributions, the pressure equations can be written in
conservative form. The resulting pressure equations became known as the CGL equations, and they can be interpreted
as the conservation laws for the first and second adiabatic invariants (Kulsrud 1983; Gurnett & Bhattacharjee 2005).
Furthermore, we discuss the general equations of collisionless multi-fluid models. The pressure equations are rigorously exact, even though the system is not closed, since the FLR pressure tensor and the entire heat flux tensor are
not specified; for a quick look see eq. (89)-(92). Rewriting the system to a form where the usual CGL conservation
laws are on the left hand side, and all other contributions on the right hand side, nicely represents the complicated
plasma heating process that can be encountered, and that are responsible for the breaking of the adiabatic invariants;
see eq. (99), (100). We also discuss the conservation of energy. For the case of periodic boundary conditions, the total
conservation of energy has a very illuminating form, that can be found for example in Yang et al. (2017b,a). That
formulation is obtained by considering the total “internal” energy for each particle species Erint = 12 hTr pr i (where the
brackets represent integration over the entire spatial domain), which only reveals the total plasma heating. Here we
int

= hp⊥r i, and formulate
split the internal energy into its parallel and perpendicular components Ekr
= 21 hpkr i, E⊥r
the total conservation of energy with the possibility of anisotropic plasma heating, see eq. (112)-(115).
The CGL description is analyzed in great detail in Section 3. We derive the CGL dispersion relation, and discuss properties of the slow, Alfvén and fast modes that are present. We verify many of the classical results of Abraham-Shrauner
(1967), here written in a slightly more convenient notation by using the parallel plasma beta βk , and the temperature
anisotropy ratio ap = T⊥ /Tk . Collisionless plasmas can not reach arbitrarily large values of temperature anisotropy,
and the linear CGL eigenmodes can indeed become unstable, with the associated instabilities referred to as the (parallel and oblique) firehose instability and the mirror instability. Similarly to MHD, the simple CGL description does
not contain any dispersive effects and is technically scale invariant, even though valid only on the largest scales. The
instability thresholds present in the CGL model therefore can be referred to as “hard” thresholds, i.e. thresholds that
are obtained in the long-wavelength low-frequency limit. The firehose and mirror instabilities are believed to play
a crucial role in solar wind dynamics (see e.g. Hellinger et al. (2006); Bale et al. (2009)), and in Figure 1, they are
plotted in the usual (βk , T⊥ /Tk ) plane with logarithmic scales. While the firehose threshold matches the one obtained
from kinetic theory, the CGL mirror threshold contains the well-known factor of 6 error for large βk values. The factor
of 6 error can be interpreted as inadequacy of the adiabatic CGL closure in the very slow-dynamics context, such as
the mirror instability. This is further addressed in Section 9.4, where we discuss that the “static” closure, which can be
viewed as a generalization of isothermal closure in presence of temperature anisotropy and variations of magnetic field
strength, reproduces the correct mirror threshold (Constantinescu 2002; Chust & Belmont 2006; Passot et al. 2006).

6
We discuss the core differences between MHD and CGL, which can be nicely summarized with the concept of
adiabatic indices γ, related to the number of degrees of freedom i by γ = (i + 2)/i. While MHD is fully 3D with
γ = 5/3, the CGL can be viewed as composed of 1D and 2D dynamics with γk = 3 and γ⊥ = 2. We also address
the velocity and magnetic field eigenvectors. Similarly to the velocity field eigenvector in MHD (see Figure 2), which
shows a “singular” behavior for strictly parallel propagation with VA = Cs , the CGL eigenvector (Figure 3) shows
similar singularity for βk = 2/(4 − T⊥/Tk ). We also briefly discuss fluid models with empirical “free” polytropic indices
γk , γ⊥ , studied for example by Hau & Sonnerup (1993); Hau et al. (1993); Abraham-Shrauner (1973).
In Section 4, we introduce the simplest dispersive effects by including the Hall term into the induction equation,
and study dispersion relations of the Hall-CGL model. We focus on the parallel firehose instability, and show that the
instability is indeed associated with the whistler mode, see Figures 4 and 5. We show that negative real frequencies
ωr < 0 have to be handled carefully, and that non-causal analytic solutions (339)-(342) have to be modified to the causal
form (350)-(353). We briefly discuss the simplest ion-cyclotron resonances, and compare solutions of the Hall-CGL
model with solutions of linear kinetic theory, see Figure 6.
In Section 5, we evaluate the FLR tensor Π at several levels of approximation. The evaluation of the FLR tensor is
cumbersome, because the tensor is described by the pressure tensor equation implicitly. We first reproduce the fully
nonlinear “inversion” procedure on how to obtain Π from expression (b̂ × Π) + (b̂ × Π)T that can be found for example
in Hsu et al. (1986); Passot & Sulem (2004); Ramos (2005) as a brief note. By applying this inversion procedure at
the pressure tensor equation evaluates the FLR corrections correctly along the magnetic field lines, but leads to an
equation for Π that is still implicit. Nevertheless, by evaluating the resulting equation at the leading-order (technically
first order in frequency and wavenumber), leads to an explicit expression for Π. We first recover the nonlinear result of
Schekochihin et al. (2010), derived in that paper slightly differently, without using the inversion procedure. We point
out that the result can be slightly simplified, and by rearranging the expression yields two different useful forms for
writing the nonlinear Π. Finally, by using the non-dispersive (MHD) induction equation, we obtain the nonlinear result
of Ramos (2005) (see also Macmahon (1965)). For further evaluation of nonlinear FLR corrections to higher-orders,
an advanced reader is referred to Ramos (2005). We continue with the evaluation of the FLR tensor in the linear
approximation, i.e. when the magnetic field lines are not too distorted. For the 1st-order tensor (here called FLR1),
we recover the classical result of Yajima (1966), which is notably different from the one provided by Oraevskii et al.
(1968). In the isotropic case, the FLR1 tensor is consistent with the one extracted from the stress tensor of Braginskii
(1965), if the collisional terms are “ignored”. It is noteworthy that a proper collisionless limit cannot be achieved
from the stress tensor of Braginskii (1965), because expressions are proportional to τ (and also 1/τ ), where τ is time
between two collisions (τ ∼ 1/ν where ν is the usual collisional frequency), so the collisionless limit τ → ∞ does not
work.
We consider the Hall-CGL-FLR1 fluid model, and we provide dispersion relation for generally oblique propagation,
which can be also found in Hunana & Zank (2017). For higher-order FLR corrections, we only provide analytic
dispersion relations for the parallel propagating whistler and ion-cyclotron modes, as well as the perpendicular fast
mode. Nevertheless, we provide linearized, normalized and Fourier transformed equations written in the x-z plane for
all the fluid models. To obtain the dispersion relation for an oblique propagation, the reader is encouraged to use
analytic software such as Maple or Mathematica, or to solve the system numerically. The 2nd-order FLR corrections
(FLR2) are here defined as containing the Hall-term and the time-derivative ∂Π/∂t. We also consider FLR corrections
k
⊥
with the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors S⊥ , S⊥
, that are here defined as FLR3. The precision of various FLR
corrections can be compared nicely by considering the perpendicular fast mode in the long-wavelength limit. The
comparison is especially meaningful, when written in the notation of Del Sarto et al. (2017), see eq. (502)-(504). We
proceed by showing that the FLR3 corrections (with the second-order non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors) indeed recover
the fully kinetic dispersion relation for the fast mode in the long-wavelength (low-frequency) limit, a result reported
by Mikhailovskii & Smolyakov (1985). Instead of expanding the pressure tensor equation, one can derive very precise
linear FLR corrections from linear kinetic theory, which is not addressed here, and the reader is referred to papers by
Passot & Sulem (2007); Sulem & Passot (2015) and references therein.
In Section 6, we investigate the parallel and oblique firehose instability. The FLR and Hall dispersive effects are
crucial for the stabilization of the firehose instability at small scales, and a comprehensive discussion can be found
in Hunana & Zank (2017). That paper was essentially extracted from this guide (with many figures that we do not
republish here), and an interested reader who wants to focus on the firehose instability can find further information
there. Nevertheless, here we briefly investigate improvements that can be made by considering the FLR2 and FLR3
corrections, see Figures 7-11. Importantly, we show that the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors in the FLR3 model,

7
partially reproduce the large “bump” in the imaginary phase speed (growth rate normalized to the wavenumber),
when the plasma is close to the long wavelength limit “hard” firehose threshold, see Figure 7. The firehose instability
in a fluid formalism was also investigated by Wang & Hau (2003, 2010); Schekochihin et al. (2010); Rosin et al. (2011)
and references therein.
In Section 7, we derive the heat flux tensor equation. The heat flux tensor is then decomposed into its gyrotropic
and non-gyrotropic parts, q = q g + q ng . The procedure yields evolution equations for the gyrotropic parallel and
perpendicular heat fluxes, qk and q⊥ , that contain the tensor of the 4th-order moment r. It is emphasized that, if
one wants to keep the non-gyrotropic Π contributions in the scalar heat flux equations, one needs to keep the nongyrotropic contributions of the 4th-order moment r ng as well, since there are several possible cancellations even at
the linear level. The non-gyrotropic heat flux q ng can be further decomposed to the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors
k
k
⊥
⊥
S⊥ , S⊥
and tensor σ. The detailed algebra of the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors S⊥ , S⊥
, i.e. how to express
them through lower-order moments, is presented in the Appendix D. The first-order expressions are obtained at the
nonlinear level and the second-order expressions at the linear level. We do not address how to decompose the tensor
σ through lower-order moments. Such calculations require a complicated “inversion” procedure for a 3rd-rank tensor
(b̂ × σ)S , and an advanced reader is referred to Ramos (2005).
In Section 8, we consider the 4th-order moment r which is a tensor of 4th-rank, rijkl . The moment is again decomposed to its gyrotropic and non-gyrotropic parts, r = r g + r ng and the gyrotropic part has three scalar components,
rkk , rk⊥ and r⊥⊥ . We show that for a bi-Maxwellian distribution function, the gyrotropic components can indeed be
evaluated as rkk = 3p2k /ρ, rk⊥ = pk p⊥ /ρ, and r⊥⊥ = 2p2⊥ /ρ. This constitutes a “normal” closure, a name suggested
by Chust & Belmont (2006). By using a similar procedure to the one provided by Grad (1949) for dilute gases, it is
possible to express the non-gyrotropic bi-Maxwellian r ng through a combination of pg and Π, see e.g. Oraevskii et al.
(1968).
In Section 9, a dispersion relation of a fluid model closed with the bi-Maxwellian “normal” closure is provided for
generally oblique propagation, and we call this model 2nd-order CGL (CGL2). We specifically focus on the mirror
instability, since this simple fluid model (without any Landau damping) corrects the erroneous 1/6 factor in the
“hard” mirror threshold found in the basic CGL description, a result also reported by Dzhalilov et al. (2011). The
mirror instability is not addressed to a higher level of sophistication in this guide. However, we note that capturing
the mirror growth rate (when the threshold is crossed) sufficiently well requires Landau fluid models (Snyder et al.
1997) and the stabilization at small scales requires FLR corrections (Passot & Sulem 2007; Sulem & Passot 2015).
We also provide the dispersion relation of the Hall-CGL2 fluid model. Finally, the CGL2 model can be simplified by
considering slow-dynamics regime and constructing generalized isothermal closure that is called the “static” closure,
yielding the simplest fluid model that captures the correct mirror threshold (Constantinescu 2002; Chust & Belmont
2006; Passot et al. 2006).
In Section 10, we consider the bi-Kappa distribution function. We show that the closure at the 4th-order moment is
constructed by rkk = ακ 3p2k /ρ, rk⊥ = ακ pk p⊥ /ρ, and r⊥⊥ = ακ 2p2⊥ /ρ, where the coefficient ακ = (κ − 3/2)/(κ − 5/2),
and the closure is valid for κ > 5/2. We call this closure and the associated fluid model as “BiKappa”, and we discuss
its dispersion relations. Even though the linear modes are generally different in this fluid model than in the CGL2 fluid
model, we show that the “hard” thresholds for the parallel and oblique firehose instability, and for the highly-oblique
mirror instability, are not affected by and are independent of the κ value. The Hall-BiKappa fluid dispersion relation
k
⊥
is also provided. We also provide the first-order non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors S⊥ , S⊥
. We do not calculate the r ng
for the bi-Kappa distribution, and therefore we do not provide the second order non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors.
In Section 11, we discuss the core differences between the usual fluid models and kinetic theory. Namely, we discuss
why the usual fluid models do not contain collisionless damping mechanisms, such as the Landau damping, regardless of
the order to which the fluid hierarchy is developed. The effect of Landau damping is present in the collisionless Vlasov
equation, and the crucial difference between the usual fluid hierarchy and kinetic calculations just lies in the technique
how the Vlasov equation is integrated over the velocity space. We introduce preliminary ideas how the Landau fluid
closures will be constructed. For example, for closures performed at the 4th-order moment instead of the “normal”
closure, one needs to consider perturbations around this state, and prescribe rkk = 3p2k /ρ + rekk , rk⊥ = pk p⊥ /ρ + rek⊥ ,
and r⊥⊥ = 2p2⊥ /ρ + re⊥⊥ . The deviations rekk , rek⊥ , re⊥⊥ will be calculated from linear kinetic theory in Part 2, by
performing Landau fluid closures.
In Section 12, we derive evolution equation for a general n-th order fluid moment (a tensor with 3n components).
We then consider fluid models in the simplified 1D geometry that can be viewed as an electrostatic case (or as a
propagation along the mean magnetic field), that are closed at a general n-th order level by a Maxwellian fluid closure.

8
A dispersion relation is obtained, which for n > 4 always yields some solutions that are unstable. It is therefore
concluded that the last non-Landau fluid closure is the “normal” closure and that for n > 4, Landau fluid closures
are required. This surprising result, first reported in Hunana et al. (2018), serves as motivation for Part 2, which is a
detailed guide to Landau fluid closures.

2. PRESSURE TENSOR EQUATION

Collisionless plasmas are described by the Vlasov equation, which in CGS units reads

∂fr
(E + v × B) · ∇v fr = 0,
+ v · ∇fr +
∂t
mr
c

(1)

and which describes how a distribution function fr (x, v, t) evolves in time. The r is the index of species and r = p
for protons, r = e for electrons, etc. The qr is the particle charge, mr the particle mass, c the speed of light, E the
electric field vector and B the magnetic field vector. The species index r can sometimes be confusing in lengthy tensor
calculations with multiple indices and for clarity we will often drop it and reintroduce it when required. To derive
the fluid equations, we need to integrate (perform an averaging) at each spatial point over the “kinetic” velocity v.
It is important to realize that the distribution function just describes the probability to find a particle with velocity
v at the position x, t and that the “kinetic” velocity v entering the distribution function f (x, v, t) is a completely
independent variable from x, t, i.e.
∂vi
∂vi
= 0.
(2)
= 0;
∂t
∂xj
Also, the magnetic and electric fields B(x, t), E(x, t) are macroscopic quantities that do not depend on v and can be
moved outside of velocity integrals over d3 v, or in another words ∂Bi /∂vj = 0 and ∂Ei /∂vj = 0. The definitions of
the fluid moments are
Z
n = f d3 v;
(3)
Z
nu = vf d3 v;
(4)
Z
p = m (v − u)(v − u)f d3 v;
(5)
Z
q = m (v − u)(v − u)(v − u)f d3 v;
(6)
Z
r = m (v − u)(v − u)(v − u)(v − u)f d3 v,
(7)
where we have omitted the tensor product notation that is sometimes written down explicitly as uu = u ⊗ u and in
the index notation (uu)ij = ui uj . If two vectors or tensors are next to each other without an operator between them,
a tensor product is always assumed. The number density n is a scalar, the fluid velocity u is a vector, the pressure
tensor p is a tensor of second rank (3 × 3 matrix), the heat flux tensor q is a tensor of third rank (with 3 × 3 × 3
components), the tensor r is of fourth rank (with 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 components), etc. Directly from the definitions, it is
obvious that all fluid tensors must be symmetric in all of their indices, i.e. pij = pji , qijk = qikj = ... The fluctuating
velocity is defined as
c = v − u,

(8)

and should not be confused with the speed of light c.
The second important concept that is used in deriving the fluid hierarchy, is the use of the usual Gauss-Ostrogradsky
(divergence) theorem. The divergence theorem is used in velocity space and, written in a form that is typically
encountered when calculating the fluid hierarchy, it reads
Z
Z
3
∇v · (f A)d v =
f A · dS.
(9)
V

S

The A is a general n-th order tensor, f is a distribution function, the left hand side is a 3D integral calculated over
the entire velocity volume V and the right hand side is a surface integral calculated over a boundary of that volume
dS = n̂dS, where n̂ is a unit normal vector to the local surface area pointing outwards. When such an integral is
encountered in the fluid hierarchy, the result is always assumed to be zero. The volume integrals are from v = −∞ to
v = ∞ in each velocity component and the integration on the right hand side of (9) is therefore performed over the
velocity surface area at infinity. The necessary (but technically not sufficient) condition for the integral to be negligible
is
lim f (v) = 0.
(10)
v→∞

10
Since the area dS ∼ v 2 dv, the sufficient condition for the integral to vanish, can be estimated more precisely as
lim f (v)A(v)v 2 = 0.

(11)

v→∞

When calculating the fluid hierarchy, the encountered expressions are always A(v) ∼ v n , where n is a positive integer.
2
Then, for example, for a Maxwellian distribution f (v) ∼ e−v the limit (11) is always zero for all n. Even for a slower
converging distribution f (v) ∼ e−|v| , the limit is always zero. For distribution functions proportional to a power
law, for example f (v) ∼ (v 2 )−(κ+1) as for a kappa-distribution, the situation is more restrictive, with some minimum
required values of κ. When we will calculate the n-th order fluid moment (Section 12), we will see that two surface
integrals are encountered, one with A(v) ∼ v n and one with A(v) ∼ v n+1 . Therefore, for a kappa-distribution, the
strict condition for limv→∞ (v 2 )−(κ+1) v n+1 v 2 = 0 yields the requirement κ > (n + 1)/2. For example, many fluid
models discussed in this guide are closed at the 4th-order moment r, so n = 4, which implies the requirement κ > 5/2.
At first sight, the required limit (11) can be considered only a technical mathematical detail, since physically, one can
argue that particles with enormously large energies will not be measured/observed, and some physical mechanism that
is responsible for a cut-off of the distribution function at finite energies, can be usually assumed. Or in another words,
even observational studies that fit the data with a kappa-distribution do not assume that the fit is valid all the way up
to v → ∞, and usually a cut-off is implicitly assumed. However, once we calculate the 4th-order moments for a kappa
distribution, we will see that for example rkk = ακ 3p2k /ρ, where ακ = (κ − 3/2)/(κ − 5/2), so the restriction κ > 5/2
returns, and has to be applied regardless. When the limit (11) is satisfied, the neglect of the surface integrals (9) is
therefore based on solid theoretical principles, and it is not an approximate or an ad-hoc choice, the surface integrals
are really zero. Nevertheless, for complete clarity in the upcoming fluid hierarchy calculations, we will differentiate
between expressions that are zero exactly, and between the surface integrals (9) that are zero asymptotically, by using
= 0 and → 0.
We start directly with the derivation of the pressure tensor equation, since a detailed derivation of the density and
momentum equations can be found in many books. To derive the pressure tensor equation, it is possible to multiply
the Vlasov equation by mci cj or mvi vj (another possibility is mci vj ). Here we will use the first choice which is slightly
easier to present in detail, because the second choice requires the use of density and momentum equations to cancel
several terms. It is useful to derive the following identities

To go back and forth between the index notation and the vector notation in a fully consistent matter, it is important to
establish some conventions that were not required in a simple fluid models. One important convention that is typically
used is that the divergence of a tensor is meant to be through its first component, i.e. for a general tensor Xijk...n , the
divergence ∇ · X means ∂i Xijk...n . This convention is the reason why in the above expression we used that qijk = qkij
and also the ordering of u and p inside ∇ · (up) reflects that in the index notation we have ∂k (uk pij ).

In the expression above, one encounters a vector product of a vector with a matrix, B × p. This operator might appear
unusual at first, but it is just a generalization of a vector product of two vectors, it is defined as (B × p)ij = ǫikl Bk plj
and the result is a matrix. Similarly, a vector product between a vector and a tensor of 3rd rank is defined as
(B × q)ijk = ǫilm Bl qmjk and for a tensor of n-th rank (B × X)i...jk = ǫilm Bl Xm...jk (i.e., the second index in ǫ is
the vector B index and the third index in ǫ is the first index of tensor X). However, a definition of a vector product
where a matrix is applied on a vector reads (p × B)ij = ǫjkl pik Bl , and in general p × B = −(B × pT )T , but since the
p is here symmetric, p × B = −(B × p)T . The vector product (cross product) is addressed further in the Appendix
B. The term (24) is sometimes rewritten as
=

B × p + (B × p)T = B × p − p × B.
Combining all the results together 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 0, yields the entire pressure tensor equation as

One notices that, for example, the pressure tensor equation of Kulsrud (1983), eq. 57, contains a minus sign typo in
the last term, which should be written as (25). That it is indeed a typo and not a definition of p × B is evident from
his subsequent eq. 59. It is useful to introduce a symmetric operator that acts on a matrix A according to

2.1. Pressure tensor decomposition

By introducing a unit vector in the direction of the local magnetic field b̂ = B/|B| and the gyrofrequency Ω =
qB0 /(mc), the last term in the pressure tensor equation (26) can be rewritten as
i
|B| h
Ω
b̂ × p + (b̂ × p)T .
(29)
B0

At very low frequencies ω ≪ Ω (and at very long spatial scales) this term will dominate and must be equal to zero.
The simplest possibility that makes this term to be equal to zero is piso = pI, where p is the scalar pressure and I is
the unit matrix. In index notation piso
ij = pδij , and we can verify that
(b̂ × piso )ij = ǫikl b̂k piso

(30)

pg = pk b̂b̂ + p⊥ (I − b̂b̂),

(32)

(31)

There is however a much more general solution that makes the term (29) equal to zero, which is

where the “g” stands for gyrotropic. For quick analytic calculations it is sometimes easier to use pg = (pk −p⊥ )b̂b̂+p⊥ I
since we have to deal with b̂b̂ only once instead of twice. We need to verify that the term (29) indeed disappears,

=>

It is easy to see that the parallel and perpendicular pressures can be extracted from the gyrotropic pressure tensor
matrix by performing double contractions according to
pk = pg : b̂b̂,

and p⊥ = pg : (I − b̂b̂)/2,

(35)

The double contraction (the double dot product, represented by the colon) is a very useful operator that is frequently
encountered in higher order fluid models. For two matrices it is defined as A : B = Aij Bij and yields a scalar.
Sometimes, the double contraction is defined as A : B = Aij Bji , which for symmetric matrices is equivalent to the
previous definition. As a reminder, the usual matrix product of two matrices is (A·B)ij = Aik Bkj and yields a matrix.
It is useful to write down the following identities that involve the double contraction,
b̂b̂ : b̂b̂ = 1;

(36)

I : b̂b̂ = 1;

(37)

(I − b̂b̂) : b̂b̂ = 0;

(38)

I : I = 3;

(39)

(I − b̂b̂) : (I − b̂b̂)/2 = 1.

(40)

Also interestingly, the trace of a matrix A can be expressed through the double contraction with I, i.e. A : I =
Aij δij = Aii = Tr(A). The pressure decomposition (35) can now be verified easily. Even more revealing is to apply
the decomposition (35) directly at the definition of the entire pressure tensor (5), which yields

where we have used the fact that the magnitude of the 3D velocity vector can be decomposed as |v − u|2 = |v⊥ −
u⊥ |2 + (vk − uk )2 , or equivalently |c|2 = |c⊥ |2 + c2k .
A distribution function is called isotropic when the direction of the velocity vector v does not matter, and the
2
distribution function depends only on magnitude |v|, as for example the Maxwellian distribution e−|v| . A distribution
function is called gyrotropic when the direction of the perpendicular velocity vector v⊥ does not matter, and the
2
2
function depends only on |v⊥ |, as for example the bi-Maxwellian distribution e−αk vk e−α⊥ |v⊥ | . In another words, the
gyrotropic distribution function is isotropic only in its transverse velocity components. The same vocabulary is used
for the fluid moments, and a fluid moment is called gyrotropic when it involves integrals over |c⊥ |2i , i = 0, 1, 2, 3 . . ..
For the pressure tensor, there are only two possibilities, represented by the parallel and perpendicular pressure (41),
(42).
The part of the pressure tensor extracted by the decomposition (35) is therefore called the gyrotropic pressure pg ,
sometimes also called the CGL pressure pCGL . The gyrotropic approximation is sufficient at very long spatial scales,
where the Larmor radius (=the gyroradius) of particles gyrating around the magnetic field is small, and the nongyrotropic contributions become negligible. However, at sufficiently small spatial scales comparable to the gyroradius,
the non-gyrotropic pressure contributions become significant and we represent these through a tensor Π, that is
called the Finite Larmor Radius (FLR) corrections to the (gyrotropic) pressure tensor, or sometimes non-gyrotropic
or gyroviscous stress tensor. The entire pressure tensor is thus decomposed according to
p = pk b̂b̂ + p⊥ (I − b̂b̂) + Π,

In the momentum equation, the pressure tensor enters through its divergence, which is useful to break down to its
components. Since ∇ · (b̂b̂) = b̂(∇ · b̂) + (b̂ · ∇)b̂, and ∇ · (p⊥ I) = ∇p⊥ , the divergence of the pressure tensor calculates


∇ · p = ∇ · (p⊥ I) + ∇ · (pk − p⊥ )b̂b̂ + ∇ · Π

= ∇p⊥ + (pk − p⊥ ) b̂(∇ · b̂) + (b̂ · ∇)b̂ + b̂(b̂ · ∇)(pk − p⊥ ) + ∇ · Π.

Importantly, we have seen in (41), (42) that the scalar parallel and perpendicular pressures are extracted by applying the
double contractions at the entire pressure tensor (and not necessarily only at the gyrotropic part). The decomposition
(43) can be rewritten as


p = p : b̂b̂ b̂b̂ + p : (I − b̂b̂)/2 (I − b̂b̂) + Π.
(46)
By applying the double contraction : b̂b̂ to (46) yields the first requirement for the FLR tensor
Π : b̂b̂ = 0.

(47)

Similarly, by applying : (I − b̂b̂)/2 to (46) yields the second requirement for the FLR tensor,
Π : (I − b̂b̂) = 0.

(48)

By further using the first requirement, the second requirement can be rewritten as
Π : I = Tr(Π) = 0.

(49)

By using the pressure decomposition (43) in the pressure tensor equation (26), and using the fact that the gyrotropic
part of pressure satisfies b̂ × pg + (b̂ × pg )T = 0, the pressure tensor equation can be rewritten as

2.3. Perpendicular pressure equation
It is possible to either apply the double contraction : (I − b̂b̂)/2 on the pressure tensor equation, and directly obtain
the equation for ∂p⊥ /∂t, or to apply the Trace (the double contraction : I), obtain the equation for ∂pk /∂t + 2∂p⊥/∂t,
and subtract the previously obtained equation for ∂pk /∂t. Both approaches are equivalent, since p⊥ = (Tr(p) − pk )/2.
In another words, directly calculating the trace of the pressure tensor yields
Trp = δij pij = pii = pk b̂i b̂i +p⊥ (δii − b̂i b̂i ) + Πii = pk + 2p⊥ ,

which is an expression of general validity since no specific form of the induction equation was assumed yet. In the
next section we will calculate the decomposition of the heat flux tensor q and we will show that if only the gyrotropic

Terms with the non-gyrotropic heat flux q ng can be further split to non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors S⊥ , S⊥
and
heat flux tensor σ, which is addressed in the Appendix D, see equations (D136), (D138). Terms containing the FLR
pressure tensor Π are usually called the FLR stress forces, and these forces can generate complicated plasma heating
processes. The FLR stress forces can generate both parallel and perpendicular plasma heating that can be determined
only from fully nonlinear numerical simulations, since all the terms disappear at the linear level. This process is also
sometimes called “stochastic heating”. The importance of stochastic heating was shown by Laveder et al. (2013), who
performed 1.5 dimensional numerical simulations with the sophisticated FLR Landau fluid model of Passot & Sulem
(2007); Passot et al. (2012).

2.4. On the paper by Chew, Goldberger, Low 1956
The very influential paper by Chew et al. (1956) that is typically cited for the CGL equations (with zero heat
fluxes) actually also derived the pressure equations when the gyrotropic heat fluxes are considered. It is important to
emphasize that even though the scalar pressures pn , ps in the notation of that paper are equal to the usual pressures
pk , p⊥ , this is not the case for the heat fluxes. The gyrotropic heat flux tensor in that paper is decomposed into
components qn , qs according to (Chew et al. 1956, eq. 34)

g
(76)
qijk
= qn b̂i b̂j b̂k + qs δij b̂k + δjk b̂i + δik b̂j .

In contrast, the usual gyrotropic heat flux decomposition to qk , q⊥ reads (see later in the text)

g
qijk
= qk b̂i b̂j b̂k + q⊥ δij b̂k + δjk b̂i + δik b̂j − 3b̂i b̂j b̂k ,

(77)

i.e. the last term is not present in their decomposition. However, this does not mean that their pressure equations
(Chew et al. (1956), eq. 31, 32) are incorrect. It only implies that their equations are written in terms of
qn = qk − 3q⊥ ;

qs = q⊥ .

(78)

By neglecting the FLR corrections Π and q ng , the parallel and perpendicular pressure equations (74), (75) simplify
to
dpk
+ pk ∇ · u + 2pk b̂ · ∇u · b̂ + ∇ · (qk b̂) − 2q⊥ ∇ · b̂ = 0;
(79)
dt
dp⊥
(80)
+ 2p⊥ ∇ · u − p⊥ b̂ · ∇u · b̂ + ∇ · (q⊥ b̂) + q⊥ ∇ · b̂ = 0.
dt
By using (78), the heat flux contributions in the parallel pressure equation above can be rewritten as


∇ · (qk b̂) − 2q⊥ ∇ · b̂ = ∇ · (qn + qs )b̂ + 2b̂ · ∇qs ,

(81)

which agrees with the parallel pressure equation obtained by Chew et al. (1956), eq. 31. The pressure equations
of Chew et al. 1956 are therefore correct, but it has to be remembered that qn is not the usual parallel heat flux

17
R
qk = m (vk − uk )3 f d3 v.1 Actually, the authors do not even call the quantities qn , qs heat flux components, but
components of a “pressure-transport” tensor.
To conclude this subsection, we will go slightly ahead and use equations (167), (168) (without the zero right hand
sides) that are the usual CGL pressure equations and valid only at long spatial scales when the Hall term in the
induction equation is neglected. Under this assumption, the pressure equations (79), (80) are rewritten as

It is often forgotten that the paper by Chew, Goldberger, Low 1956 derived the correct pressure equations with
gyrotropic heat flux contributions. The authors however did not write the equations in the form (82), (83), and left
them in the form (79), (80), using the “conservative” form only after prescribing the closure qk = q⊥ = 0 (their eq.
35, 36):

Over time, equations (84), (85) became known as the CGL description. Equations (84), (85) are often replaced by the
equations of state pk |B|2 /ρ3 = const. and p⊥ /(ρ|B|) = const., see e.g. Mjølhus (2009). Additionally, similarly to the
definition of (appropriately normalized) entropy in MHD, s = ln(p/ργ ), it is useful to define parallel and perpendicular
entropy in the CGL model, according to

The total entropy, sk + s⊥ = ln(pk p⊥ ρ−5/3 ), is equivalent to the MHD entropy when pk = p⊥ , see for example eq.
9-11 in Abraham-Shrauner (1967).
2.5. Physical meaning of CGL equations

The exact derivation of the CGL equation (84), (85) will be completed in the next section. Here we briefly discuss
the physical meaning of these equations. The CGL equations (85), (84) can be interpreted as the conservation of the
1st and 2nd adiabatic invariants, as is nicely discussed for example by Kulsrud (1983) and by Gurnett & Bhattacharjee
(2005). Considering many particles with velocity components vk and v⊥ with respect to the mean magnetic field, the
parallel and perpendicular pressures can be estimated as
pk ∼ hvk2 iρ;

2
p⊥ ∼ hv⊥
iρ,

(87)

where the brackets represent an average over all particles. To complete the estimate, we need expressions for hvk2 i and
2
hv⊥
i, which come from the conservation of the adiabatic invariants. The 1st adiabatic invariant is the conservation
of magnetic moment µ of a particle that is gyrating periodically around a mean magnetic field. The 2nd adiabatic
invariant, sometimes also called the longitudinal invariant, is associated with a particle bouncing periodically between
two
H b magnetic mirror points. The conserved quantity is the integral over the parallel momentum of a particle J ≡
a mvk dl, where the magnetic mirrors are located at “a” and “b” and the integral is performed along the magnetic
field line. The distance between the two magnetic mirrors at “a” and “b” can be labeled as L. The conservation of the
1st and 2nd adiabatic invariants is therefore
2
mv⊥
= const.;
J ≡ mvk L = const.
(88)
µ≡
2B
Since we are considering only non-relativistic particles, the particle mass “m” is also a constant. The conservation
2
of magnetic moment µ therefore implies v⊥
∼ B, and using this in (87) yields p⊥ ∼ Bρ, recovering (85). The
CGL equation (85) therefore corresponds to conservation of magnetic moment, i.e., the 1st adiabatic invariant. The

(vk − uk )3 f d3 v, but this definition should be avoided.

18
conservation of the second adiabatic invariant J is more tricky, since we need to somehow estimate the non-intuitive
length L between the two magnetic mirrors, and no magnetic mirrors are explicitly assumed, since we are just dealing
with somewhat random magnetic field lines. The length L can be nevertheless estimated from two fundamental
physical principles. Consider a magnetic flux tube (a deformed cylinder) with cross sectional area A and length L.
The conservation of the total magnetic flux through the area A implies AB = const., which yields an estimate for the
area A ∼ 1/B. The second principle is the conservation of the total mass of particles that are completely trapped in
that flux tube and that can not escape, mnAL = const., yielding L ∼ 1/(ρA). The use of A ∼ 1/B yields the final
estimate for the non-intuitive length L ∼ B/ρ. The conservation of the 2nd adiabatic invariant J therefore implies
vk ∼ 1/L ∼ ρ/B. Using this result in (87) implies pk ∼ ρ3 /B 2 , recovering (84). The CGL equation (84) corresponds
to conservation of the second adiabatic invariant J, and the equation is valid for particles that are completely trapped
and therefore cannot carry a heat flux. As we discuss later, the consideration of the Hall-term, the heat flux, and
the FLR stress forces (the stochastic heating), leads to the breaking of these two adiabatic invariants. Nevertheless,
exact conservation laws can still be derived, and the very simple CGL equations (84), (85) have to be modified with
non-zero right hand sides.
In Part 2 of our guide (see section 4.1), we show that the conservation of magnetic moment is very useful for
understanding the form of the perturbed distribution function f (1) in the gyrotropic limit. By performing calculations
in the laboratory reference frame, we show that to obtain the correct f (1) in the gyrotropic limit actually requires
the usual complicated kinetic integration around the unperturbed orbit (see Appendix of Part 2) and only then the
gyrotropic limit can be imposed. In contrast, performing calculations in the guiding-center reference frame allows one
to prescribe the conservation of magnetic moment from the beginning, and obtain the correct f (1) in the gyrotropic
limit perhaps more intuitively. Conservation of adiabatic invariants is important in many areas of space physics and
astrophysics. For example, conservation of adiabatic invariants is used to construct models that describe particles
trapped inside of magnetic islands and that are being accelerated during magnetic island contraction and merging
(Drake et al. 2013; Zank et al. 2014).
2.6. Exact equations of anisotropic multi-fluid models
Before we discuss solutions of specific fluid models, it is beneficial to summarize the most general equations of multifluid models that were derived with no simplifications at all. By reintroducing the species index r, the equations that
were directly obtained by integrating the collisionless Vlasov equation read

where the convective derivative dr /dt = ∂/∂t + ur · ∇. In the above equations, the pressure tensor for each species was
just decomposed to a gyrotropic contributions pkr , p⊥r and the rest of the pressure tensor (the FLR pressure tensor
Πr ), according to
pr = pkr b̂b̂ + p⊥r (I − b̂b̂) + Πr ,

(93)

which is a rigorous decomposition not introducing any simplifications. The heat flux qr contributions are here left at
the most general level without any simplifications either. The equations are accompanied by the Maxwell’s equations,
that for now we write down here with no simplifications to emphasize that no Maxwell’s equations were used in deriving
the above system,

Equations (89)-(95) represent exact (even though not closed) kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell system formulated in fluid variables, and the description is valid for any general distribution function and for all considered spatial and temporal
scales. All advanced collisionless multi-fluid models have to be based in one way or another on these equations. One
can concentrate on the proton dynamics or one can concentrate on the electron dynamics and simplify these equations
accordingly for these spatial scales. Naturally, one can consider complicated multi-fluid descriptions composed of many
particle species.
For a new reader who just jumped straight to this section, the symmetric operator “S” acts on a matrix Aij according
to ASij = Aij + Aji . If one does not like the symmetric operator in the expressions above, the symmetric operator is
actually not necessary, since

(98)

where we also got rid of the double contractions. Note that Πik = Πki and also pik = pki .
Equations (89)-(92) contain two very important catches - the entire heat flux tensor qr and the nongyrotropic
pressure tensor Πr are not specified yet. In this moment, the entire class of collisionless fluid models separates to
many possible classes and sub-classes, depending on how precisely one wants to evaluate the heat flux tensor qr and
the FLR pressure tensor Πr . There are several complications how to correctly model these two quantities, but before
we discuss this, we want to point out that by using the simple general identities (162), (163) (that are nothing more
than calculating derivatives and using the density equation for each species separately), the above pressure equations
can be rewritten to the following form

Again, no simplifications were introduced and no Maxwell’s equations were used yet. The equations are exact. The
equations represent the complicated plasma heating processes that are responsible for anisotropic plasma heating, and
that are in general very difficult to classify. The left hand sides of (99)-(100) are the familiar CGL equations that
represent conservations of the first and second adiabatic invariants, and all the expressions on the right hand sides break
these adiabatic invariants. On the right hand side, we have the ∂B/∂t that couples various species together through
the Maxwells equations, and that also introduces the Hall-term responsible for the simplest dispersive effects. The heat
flux tensor qr (a tensor of 3rd rank), is decomposed to its gyrotropic and non-gyrotropic (FLR) part qr = qrg + qrng .
At large scales, the gyrotropic heat flux can be viewed as a gateway for the simplest forms of collisionless damping
mechanisms, known as Landau damping, that can be further separated to a “pure” electrostatic Landau damping,
and its magnetic analogue, the transit-time damping - see Part 2 of the text, subsection “Coulomb force & mirror
force (Landau damping & transit time damping)”. Nevertheless, fluid models that contain the gyrotropic heat flux
fluctuations, but that do not contain any Landau damping can be constructed as well (see CGL2 model later in the
text). The FLR pressure tensor Πr introduces further dispersive effects and therefore also modifies the collisionless
damping rates, as well as the heat flux qr modifies the FLR pressure corrections Πr . The quantities qr and Πr
are therefore generally coupled. Importantly, the FLR pressure tensor Πr introduces complicated turbulent plasma
heating processes, referred to as stochastic heating. Since these FLR stress forces completely disappear at the linear
level in the above pressure equations, they can be explored only with fully nonlinear numerical simulations (Πr still
enters at the linear level in the momentum equation and modifies the dispersion relations).
From a fluid perspective, there are several major difficulties how to correctly model the quantities Πr and qr . The
heat flux tensor qr is described by an infinite hierarchy of higher-order fluid moments, and one needs to find an
appropriate way, how to close the system. The FLR pressure tensor Πr is described by equations that are implicit,

20
and the FLR corrections have to be typically expanded on temporal and spatial scales in order to obtain tractable
expressions that can be used for numerical simulations. This expansion will naturally restrict the area of validity
of such fluid models to those scales considered. For example, for the proton-electron plasma where the spatial and
temporal scales are largely separated because of the mass ratio mp /me = 1836, simplest first order FLR corrections
expanded around the proton scales kρi , ω/Ωp will long lose their validity at the electron scales. The most complicated
Landau fluid models that use linear kinetic theory to evaluate Π and that contain the Bessel functions Passot & Sulem
(2007); Passot et al. (2012); Sulem & Passot (2015), have technically no restriction for wavenumbers k⊥ ρi , but the
first order frequency restriction is there nevertheless.
2.7. Conservation of energy
The equations (99)-(100), that correctly split the entire plasma heating to parallel and perpendicular heating, are
indeed quite complicated. To gain further insight, let’s briefly consider a case in which we are not interested in
parallel and perpendicular heating (whose net effect can be possibly zero), and we are only interested in the heating
of the entire system. Such formulations are sometimes used to interpret plasma heating in fully kinetic simulations
Yang et al. (2017b,a). By summing together the pressure equations (91), (92), we are interested in the evolution
equation ∂(pk + 2p⊥ )/∂t, or in another words we are interested in ∂Trp/∂t. Summing the equations together (actually
the trace of the entire pressure tensor equation was calculated few pages back, that is how the p⊥ equation was derived)
yields

periodic box, one can use the Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem (9), now in a spatial domain, and for periodic boundary
conditions all divergence operators in (101) vanish, yielding

Equations (101), (103) are equivalent to equations 4 and 7 of Yang et al. (2017b). Here the equations are just written in
such a way that one can explicitly see the pressure components pk , p⊥ , Π, but the equations are equivalent. Following
Yang et al. (2017b), one can also easily derive the evolution equations for the “kinetic” energy and the electromagnetic

3. CGL DESCRIPTION

The CGL model is the simplest possible fluid model that incorporates anisotropic temperatures. In contrast to
MHD, CGL contains two pressure equations. For very good MHD reviews, from the perspective of turbulence in the
solar wind, and the use of MHD in modeling heliospheric and astrophysical plasmas, we recommend the reviews by
Goldstein et al. (1995); Tu & Marsch (1995); Zank (1999); Zhou et al. (2004); Bruno & Carbone (2013). The CGL
model is obtained by using the parallel and perpendicular pressure equations (74), (75) and prescribing zero heat flux
qk = q⊥ = 0, q ng = 0, and by neglecting the FLR pressure tensor Π = 0. The pressure equations greatly simplify to
the form
∂pk
+ ∇ · (pk u) + 2pk b̂ · ∇u · b̂ = 0;
(117)
∂t
∂p⊥
+ ∇ · (p⊥ u) + p⊥ ∇ · u − p⊥ b̂ · ∇u · b̂ = 0.
(118)
∂t
By using the notation for the convective derivative d/dt = ∂/∂t + u · ∇, the pressure equations can be rewritten as

dpk
+ pk ∇ · u + 2pk b̂ · ∇u · b̂ = 0;
(119)
dt
dp⊥
(120)
+ 2p⊥ ∇ · u − p⊥ b̂ · ∇u · b̂ = 0.
dt
Note that the CGL pressure equations are fully nonlinear and that the nonlinearities are actually of 4th order, i.e.
CGL pressure equations are more nonlinear than the usual MHD pressure equation dp/dt + γp∇ · u = 0, where the
nonlinearity is only of 2nd order. At first sight, expressions b̂ · ∇u · b̂ might appear to be a little unusual when written
without any brackets. From MHD, one is familiar with nonlinear expressions of the type u · ∇u, which are also usually
written without any brackets and can be interpreted in two equivalent forms, either as (u · ∇)u (a scalar u · ∇ applied
on a vector u; or u·(∇u) (a vector u multiplied by a matrix ∇u). In a similar fashion, the expression b̂·∇u· b̂ is meant
to be interpreted as (b̂ · ∇u) · b̂ or b̂ · (∇u) · b̂; but importantly, it is not meant to be interpreted as b̂ · ∇(u · b̂), because
the derivative is meant to act only on u in this case. For direct numerical simulations, the 4th order nonlinearity
explicitly reads
b̂ · ∇u · b̂ = b̂i (∇u)ij b̂j = b̂i b̂j ∂i uj = b̂x (b̂x ∂x ux + b̂y ∂x uy + b̂z ∂x uz )

+ b̂y (b̂x ∂y ux + b̂y ∂y uy + b̂z ∂y uz ) + b̂z (b̂x ∂z ux + b̂y ∂z uy + b̂z ∂z uz ),

(121)

and is of course a scalar. So far, we have not made any assumptions about particle species, and have only integrated
the Vlasov equation and derived the density, momentum and scalar pressure equations, which can be done for each
species separately. By re-introducing the species index r, where r = p for protons, r = e for electrons etc., the n-fluid
CGL-type equations become

The above CGL pressure equations are valid regardless of the form of the induction equation ∂B/∂t and are therefore
very general and valid for a wide range of CGL-type n-fluid models. It is advisable to keep them in this form when
considering direct numerical simulations or solving linear dispersion relations. The above equations are accompanied
P
by Maxwell’s equations. Specifically, 1) Gauss’s law ∇ · E = 4πρc where the total charge density ρc = r qr nr , 2)
4π
1 ∂E
∇ · B = 0, 3) Faraday’s
induction equation ∇ × E = − 1c ∂B
∂t and 4) Ampère’s law ∇ × B = c j + c ∂t , where the
P
total current j = r qr nr ur . In many areas of space physics and astrophysics it is often very useful to eliminate
very high frequency effects occurring at frequencies higher than the plasma frequency. This is achieved by prescribing
local charge neutrality (so called quasi-neutrality since the plasma is still ionized) by ρc = 0 and by neglecting the
second term in the Ampère’s law 1c ∂E
∂t known as Maxwell’s displacement current (or Maxwell’s correction to Ampère’s
law). This eliminates high frequency effects such as for example plasma oscillations known as Langmuir waves. This
assumption is also equivalent to assuming that the Alfvén speed is much less than the speed of light VA /c ≪ 1. It is

23
important to emphasize that the Gauss’s law ∇ · E = 4πρc is replaced by the quasi-neutrality condition ρc = 0 and no
requirement is imposed on ∇ · E (other than it is small). For further discussion concerning the charge neutrality and
∇ · E, see for example Braginskii (1965) page 264, Webb et al. (2007) eq. 7, and Passot & Sulem (2007) eq. A1. The
Maxwell’s equations in this approximation simplify to

and this form of Maxwell’s equations is considered in most of the fluid models that we discuss, regardless of future
complexities arising from FLR corrections, heat flux, Landau damping and so on. The exception is section in Part
2 “Electron Landau damping of the Langmuir mode”, where the displacement current has to be retained. Here we
further focus only on a plasma consisting of protons and electrons, with charges qp = e and qe = −e, but models with
more species can of course be considered. Charge neutrality implies that the proton and electron number densities are
equal, i.e. np = ne = n. By using the definition of current j = enup − enue , the electron velocities are related to the
proton velocities by

The last term represents the effects of electron inertia and is for example responsible for the effect that at small
spatial scales the frequency ω of the parallel whistler mode converges to the electron cyclotron frequency Ωe instead of
increasing to infinity. When considering only relatively low frequencies, it is very useful to neglect the electron inertia
term.2 This yields somewhat simpler analytic expressions, but most importantly, it provides a great benefit for direct
numerical simulations since the time step is not restricted by the requirement to fully resolve the electron motion.
This of course restricts the validity of a model to frequencies that are sufficiently smaller than the electron cyclotron
frequency. By neglecting the electron inertia and using (130), the electric field can be expressed as

and is accompanied by the parallel and perpendicular pressure equations (124), (125) for the proton and electron
species. In the induction equation (136), the first term is the familiar term from the MHD induction equation and
considering only this first term yields the classical CGL model (where in addition the electrons are prescribed to be cold
to eliminate pe from the momentum equation). The second term in the induction equation represents the Hall-term,
and fluid models containing this term are generally referred to as Hall-CGL fluid models. The third term represents

the electron pressure contributions and in CGL plasmas the term is in general nonzero, since

∇ · pe = (pke − p⊥e ) b̂ · ∇b̂ + b̂∇ · b̂ + b̂b̂ · ∇(pke − p⊥e ) + ∇p⊥e .

(137)

In contrast, by prescribing the electrons to be isotropic and isothermal (a typical assumption used in hybrid simulations)

(0)
with pressure pe = pe I, pe = nTe , so that ∇ · pe = ∇pe = Te ∇n, eliminates the pressure term since ∇ × [ n1 ∇n] =
∇ × [∇ln(n)] = 0. By prescribing the electrons to be isotropic but not isothermal, with pressure pe = pe I, the term
initially does not disappear and it is equal to

The term only disappears after the equation of state is prescribed, for example for pe ∼ nγ . The term (138) is
sometimes called the “battery” term (Biermann 1950; Kulsrud et al. 1997; Khomenko et al. 2017), since it is argued
that for any deviations from an ideal equation of state (caused for example by shocks), the term can produce magnetic
field fluctuations even if there is no magnetic field initially.
3.1. Normalized equations and definitions
As with MHD and Hall-MHD, it is often useful to work with normalized equations. The density, velocity, magnetic
(0)
field and pressure are normalized with respect to ρ0 , u0 , B0 , pk . The length is normalized with respect to (for now)
arbitrary x0 and the time with respect to t0 = x0 /u0 . The normalized quantities are then

where the Alfvén speed VA = B0 / 4πρ0 . The momentum equation implies that it is beneficial to choose the (so far
unspecified) normalizing velocity u0 to be the Alfvén speed u0 = VA . If the 2nd and 3rd terms are neglected in the
induction equation (i.e. when the usual MHD induction equation is used), the CGL system is independent of lengthscale x0 , similarly to the MHD system. If the Hall term is considered, it is beneficial to choose (so far unspecified)
normalizing length-scale x0 to be the ion inertial length

We note that normalizations do not have to be done with respect to mean values, and normalizations with respect to

Zank & Matthaeus (1993).
3.2. Classical CGL model with cold electrons
Here we want to consider the simplest possible CGL model for the proton species. We assume the electrons to be
massless and cold (pe = 0), and we also neglect the Hall-term in the induction equation. Since only proton species
are present, for simplicity we can drop the proton index “p”. Let’s work in physical units for a moment. The classical
CGL model with cold electrons therefore reads (written in physical units)

(156)

Similarly to the usual MHD model, the CGL equations are scale-invariant and do not contain any information about
the physical length scale. A length scale is introduced by considering the Hall-term in the induction equation, and we
discuss the Hall-CGL model in the next section. Also, the absence of the Hall-term allows the CGL pressure equations
to be rewritten into “conservative” form as

where d/dt is the convective derivative. This formulation is the most often cited form of the CGL pressure equations
(often the |B| is abbreviated only as B, which can lead to confusion on how to correctly calculate the derivatives).
We want to show the equivalence of (157) and (154), (155). We need the following identity,

Equations (167)-(168) verify that the CGL pressure equations (157) written in the “conservative” form and the directly
derived CGL equations (154)-(155) are equivalent. We will see that the right hand side of the usual CGL equations
(157) is nonzero if the Hall-term is considered, and that it is further modified by the heat flux contributions and by
the FLR stress forces.
3.3. Linearized CGL equations
To obtain the dispersion relations, the equations need to be linearized and transformed to Fourier space. Equations
(0)
(152)-(156) are linearized with respect to mean values ρ0 ; u(0) ≡ hui = 0; pk⊥ ; B0 = (0, 0, B0 ); b̂0 = (0, 0, 1) where the
magnetic field B0 is assumed to be in the z-direction. We assume that the mean value of the velocity is zero (the zero
mean velocity value u(0) = 0 should not be confused with normalizing velocity as in (139), which is later chosen to be

Additionally, the 3 components of the induction equation are not independent, but satisfy the ∇ · B = 0 constraint.
In order to find the linear dispersion relations, without any loss of generality, we consider wave propagation in the x-z
plane and assume that there is no variation with respect to the y-coordinate (i.e. one assumes that all expressions
containing ∂y are zero; alternatively, one can consider propagation in the y-z plane, where all expressions containing
∂x would be zero). By exploring the above system, it is noteworthy that the density equation does not play any role
in determining the dispersion relation, since no other equation contains the variable ρ.
3.4. Alfvén mode
On considering (184)-(190) written in the x-z plane with ∂y = 0, it is apparent that the equations for uy and By
decouple from the entire system and by applying ∂/∂t at the equation for uy yields

Considering a wave propagating obliquely in the x-z plane with the wavevector k = (k⊥ , 0, kk ) at an angle θ with
respect to the z-direction (the B0 direction), the parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers are defined as
kk = k cos θ;

k⊥ = k sin θ,

(194)

and the transformation to Fourier space is performed according to (see Appendix A)
∂

It is important to emphasize that similarly to MHD, the Alfvén mode propagates in all the oblique directions, with
frequency ω that is proportional to the projection of the wavenumber k to the direction of B0 , i.e. kk = k cos θ.
If the expression under the square root in (197) becomes negative, i.e. if 1 + βk (ap − 1)/2 < 0, the frequency ω is
imaginary and the Alfvén mode becomes unstable. This instability, that affects the obliquely propagating Alfvén mode
is known as the oblique firehose instability. The necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the instability to develop
(0)
(0)
is ap = T⊥ /Tk < 1. The firehose instability criterion can be rewritten in many forms, the most common being

The first expression directly implies that if βk ≤ 2, no firehose instability can exist. The firehose instability therefore
exists only for a relatively high plasma beta βk > 2 and only if the parallel temperature is higher than the perpendicular
temperature. Importantly, the firehose instability criterium in the CGL model is equivalent to the one found from
linear kinetic theory in the long-wavelength limit (for example, Rosenbluth (1956); Chandrasekhar et al. (1958); Parker
(1958); Vedenov & Sagdeev (1958)). Alfvén wave propagation only affects components uy and By which are decoupled
from the rest of the system, and yields the other (eigenvector) components as ux , uz , Bx , Bz being zero. The uy
component does not enter the density equation and Alfvén mode fluctuations therefore do not produce any density
fluctuations or pressure fluctuations. The Alfvén mode is therefore incompressible. It is also useful to define the
magnetic compressibility χb (kk , k⊥ ) in Fourier space, that measures the relative ratio of magnetic energy in the parallel
component versus the total magnetic energy
|Bz |2
.
|Bx |2 + |By |2 + |Bz |2

χb (kk , k⊥ ) =

(199)

Since the Alfvén mode produces only By fluctuations, with Bx = Bz = 0, the magnetic compressibility for this mode
is
χb (kk , k⊥ ) = 0,

(200)

for all the propagation directions. Sometimes the magnetic compressibility is defined as a ratio of parallel and perpendicular energies |Bz |2 /(|Bx |2 + |By |2 ), this quantity however has a slight disadvantage in that the values can become
very large (and actually equal to infinity), which makes plotting of this quantity problematic. In contrast, the magnetic
compressibility as defined in (199), has a nicely bounded range of values between 0 and 1. A similar quantity is defined
for the ratio of the energy in velocity fluctuations
χu (kk , k⊥ ) =

|uz |2
,
|ux |2 + |uy |2 + |uz |2

(201)

and the Alfvén mode has χu = 0 for all propagation directions, since only the perpendicular velocity component uy is
nonzero.

One can proceed in several ways with the above dispersion relation.
In the specific cases of strictly parallel (k⊥ = 0) and strictly perpendicular (kk = 0) propagation directions it is
actually easier to work directly with the system (204), because the off-diagonal components in the matrix are zero
and the dynamics in the ux and uz components decouples. For strictly parallel propagation one solution is in the ux
component, with the dispersion relation identical to the Alfvén wave (197). Since the magnetic and velocity fluctuations
are only in the ux , bx components, the compressibility χb = 0 and χu = 0 for this mode. The second solution for
parallel propagation
and it is called the sound mode, or the ion-acoustic mode, with dispersion
q is in the uz component,
p
(0)
relation ω = ±kk 3pk /ρ0 = ±kk VA 3βk /2. The parallel ion-acoustic mode has χu = 1 and χb = 0. Considering
strictly perpendicular propagation, the waves in the uz component vanish withq
the solution ω = 0. The waves in the
p
(0)
ux component are fast magnetosonic waves with dispersion relation ω = ±k⊥ VA2 + 2p⊥ /ρ0 = ±k⊥ VA 1 + ap βk ,
q
(0)
and χu = 0 and χb = 1. It is also possible to define the parallel and perpendicular sound speeds Ck = 3pk /ρ0 ;
q
(0)
C⊥ = 2p⊥ /ρ0 , which yields the parallel acoustic mode dispersion ω = ±kk Ck and the perpendicular fast mode
p
2. 4
dispersion ω = ±k⊥ VA2 + C⊥
In the general case of oblique propagation, we choose to use the normalized frequencies and wavenumbers (145), and
rewrite the dispersion relation as

can be used to write the CGL dispersion relation in a shorter form, as done later in (307). The solution of
p
e 2 = (A2 ± A22 − 4A0 )/2, and it is obvious that the coefficient A2 is always positive,
the polynomial (206) is simply ω
since both the plasma beta and the temperature anisotropy ratio must be always positive. It is also possible to show
that the discriminant under the square root A22 − 4A0 ≥ 0 (proof shown few lines below). The solution with the minus
sign is called the slow mode and the solution with the plus sign is called the fast mode. For the slow mode, ω
e 2 becomes
negative (and ω
e complex) when A0 < 0, implying that the slow mode becomes unstable when

where we suppress the tildes on the wavenumbers since the above condition is valid for both e
k and k forms of
wavenumbers. The above condition implies that there are two competing instabilities. The highly parallel propagation
with kk ≫ k⊥ yields instability threshold equivalent to (198) and the associated instability is called the parallel firehose
instability. The highly oblique propagation with k⊥ ≫ kk yields the mirror instability and the threshold in the CGL

It is well documented that the mirror instability threshold in the CGL description is not equivalent to the one found
in linear kinetic theory. In particular, the CGL mirror threshold contains a factor of 6 error (Abraham-Shrauner 1967;
Tajiri 1967; Kulsrud 1983; Ferrière & André 2002), since the correct threshold obtained from kinetic theory reads

The threshold (209) implies that the necessary condition for the mirror instability to exist in the CGL description is
(0)
(0)
ap = T⊥ /Tk > 6, whereas in kinetic theory the necessary condition is ap > 1. A very good discussion about the
physical mechanism of the mirror instability and the role of resonant particles can be found in Southwood & Kivelson
(1993); Kivelson & Southwood (1996). The correct mirror instability threshold is obtained when using the normal
closure discussed later on in the text or, more simply, its quasi-static limit (Constantinescu 2002; Chust & Belmont
2006; Passot et al. 2006). In the opposite case where ions are cold, a similar electron temperature anisotropy instability
is obtained which is called the field-swelling instability, see e.g. Basu & Coppi (1984).
Returning to the oblique dispersion relation, we show that indeed A22 − 4A0 ≥ 0. By using (194) the wavenumber k
can be pulled out of the A0 , A2 coefficients and the dispersion relation can be rewritten in terms of a phase speed as
(e

and ap = T⊥ /Tk (for a direct comparison with units used in that paper, the relations are βk = 2Sk and ap βk = 2S⊥ ).
The magnetic compressibility of the slow and fast modes can be calculated easily directly from the induction equations
(188). The slow and fast modes generate only components Bx and Bz with the component By = 0. The transformation
of (188) to Fourier space yields −ωBx = B0 kk ux , and −ωBz = −B0 k⊥ ux , and by applying the magnitude operator
yields the magnetic compressibility
k2
χb (kk , k⊥ ) = 2 ⊥ 2 = sin2 θ.
(216)
kk + k⊥
For quasi-parallel propagation angles the magnetic compressibility χb is therefore not a good indicator for mode
recognition, since all three modes have χb close to zero. The magnetic compressibility is however an excellent tool
for oblique propagation angles, because the Alfvén mode has χb = 0 regardless of the propagation direction, whereas
for the slow and fast mode χb increases with θ towards χb = 1. We will leave discussion about the CGL velocity
eigenvector (the ratio χu ) to a later subsection since the discussion is a bit technical, and we instead focus now on an
interesting effect that can be directly obtained by considering the CGL dispersion relations.

5 To obtain the mirror instability threshold, it is not possible to consider strictly perpendicular propagation with k = 0 because the
k
coefficient A0 would be exactly zero. The mirror threshold is revealed only in the highly oblique limit k⊥ ≫ kk .

Figure 1. Analytic “hard” thresholds of the mirror instability (blue) and the firehose instability (red) at long wavelengths.
Solid lines are solutions of the linear kinetic theory (bi-Maxwellian) and crosses are solutions of the linear CGL model. The
firehose instability is described correctly (both the oblique firehose and the parallel firehose), whereas the mirror instability
contains an asymptotic factor of 6 error for large βk values. The black dashed line is the CGL threshold (219), where for all
oblique directions the slow mode speed vs matches the Alfvén mode speed vA , and which separates two regions where vs < vA
and vs > vA . The green dotted curve is a special case for parallel propagation (224) where vsk = vAk . For parallel propagation
the slow mode speed cannot exceed the Alfvén mode speed, but can only match it, and the green dotted curve separates two
regions where vsk < vAk and vsk = vAk . For a similar plot in linear scale, see Figure 1 of Abraham-Shrauner (1967).

3.6. Slow mode can become faster than Alfvén mode
There is a very interesting phenomenon present in the CGL description that is also observed in the kinetic description
but that is absent in the MHD description. For a sufficiently high plasma beta, the slow mode phase speed can be larger
than the Alfvén mode phase speed. To obtain the critical plasma beta when this happens, one can write the dispersion
relation for the Alfvén wave as (e
ω /e
k)2A = (1 − βk /2 + apβk /2) cos2 θ ≡ AA and using this expression with the dispersion
p
relation (211), the critical condition when the slow mode speed matches the Alfvén speed is (A2 − A22 − 4A0 )/2 = AA ,
and since A22 − 4A0 ≥ 0, this further yields A2A − A2 AA + A0 = 0. It takes quite a few algebraic operations to simplify
the result, the easiest way is to collect terms with different powers of βk and then simplify. A very valuable approach
available now is to use mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica for guidance, and for example the Maple
command simplify(expr,trig) immediately simplifies the result, which can then be of course verified with pencil and
paper. The result is
3

h
3
(217)
A2A − A2 AA + A0 = − sin2 θ cos2 θ 1 + βk ap − 2 + βk2 ap ap − 2 = 0.

4
The expression is naturally satisfied for cases of strictly parallel and strictly perpendicular propagation. For θ = π/2,
both the slow mode and the Alfvén mode have zero frequency. For θ = 0, the slow mode speed can be only smaller
or equal to the speed of the Alfvén mode (never higher), depending on another condition that will be easier to clarify
later when specifically considering the parallel propagation limit. Now, on which side of the threshold (217) does the
speed of the slow mode become faster than the speed of the Alfvén mode? Working with inequalities is a bit trickier.
By assuming that both modes have real frequencies (and are not firehose or mirror unstable), the condition is derived
to be

which agrees with the result obtained by Abraham-Shrauner 1967, eq. 42. The expression (218) reveals that there is
a condition that can be satisfied for all directions of propagation and that reads

This is a quadratic equation in βk which can be solved easily for a given ap (or solved for ap for a given βk ). To
visualize this equation, the threshold is plotted in Figure 1 as a black dashed line. A particularly useful result is
obtained for isotropic temperatures (ap = 1). In this case the inequality (219) becomes 1 − βk /2 − βk2 5/4 ≤ 0 and the
critical plasma beta at which the slow mode speed becomes larger than the Alfvén mode speed is

Thus, this effect exists in the CGL description even when the temperatures are isotropic.
3.7. CGL parallel propagation
When numerically solving the CGL dispersion relations for finite (nonzero) propagation angles, the slow and fast
mode expressions always get the correct ordering with ωs ≤ ωf . It is sometimes confusing about how the dispersion
relations hold in the limit of parallel propagation θ → 0 which we will address here. In this limit, the dispersion
relations (215) for the slow and fast modes can be directly evaluated as

Now, because a2 = |a|, for further calculation one needs to determine the sign of the expression under the square
root. For 1 + 21 ap βk − 2βk > 0, i.e. when βk < 2/(4 − ap ), the above equations yield

(e

so the slow mode is the sound/acoustic mode and the fast mode coincides with the Alfvén mode. However, for
1 + 12 ap βk − 2βk < 0, i.e. when βk > 2/(4 − ap ), the dispersion relations yield
(e

(e

so the slow mode coincides with the Alfvén mode and the fast mode is the sound/acoustic mode. In this region, the
slow mode phase speed will always stay equal to the Alfvén mode phase speed, regardless of further increases of βk .
In the special case when 1 + 12 ap βk − 2βk = 0, which is equivalent to

all three modes propagate with the same phase speed (e
ω /e
k)2Asf = 32 βk . The criterion (224) can be satisfied only for
βk ≥ 1/2 and in the limit βk → ∞ the asymptote is ap = 4, so the possible range of ap is [0, 4]. This curve is plotted in
Figure 1 as a green dotted line. The curve separates two regions. In the first region βk < 2/(4 − ap) and vsk < vAk . In
the second region βk > 2/(4 − ap ) and vsk = vAk . The interesting result to remember is that for isotropic temperatures
(ap = 1) and parallel propagation, the critical plasma beta at which the slow mode speed matches the Alfvén mode
speed is

3.8. CGL with T⊥ = Tk is not equivalent to MHD
It is important to emphasize that even for isotropic temperatures ap = 1, the CGL dispersion (215) is not equivalent
to the MHD dispersion for the slow and fast waves. The MHD dispersion is usually written in the form (see (C16) in
the Appendix C)

which nicely shows that the expression under the square root is always greater or equal to zero. The MHD sound
speed is defined as Cs2 = γp(0) /ρ0 , where γ = 5/3. Rewritten with parameters we use here Cs2 /VA2 = γβk /2 = 5βk /6,

We wrote down all major possibilities on purpose, since we wanted to clearly show that regardless of the choice of βk
and γ, the MHD dispersion relation can not match the CGL dispersion relation simultaneously for all propagation
directions θ. One could even play with an abstract idea to make the MHD γ dependent on angle θ, and possibly βk .
Even then, there is no obvious way to modify the MHD dispersion relation so that it behaves like the CGL model.
Additionally, the CGL description leads to the development of pressure anisotropy even when the initial pressure is
isotropic.
3.9. MHD velocity eigenvector
Before we proceed with the discussion of the CGL velocity eigenvector (which can appear to be a bit tricky), for
the sake of clarity it is useful to consider the simpler MHD case first. By following the steps outlined above, it is easy
to show that again the Alfvén mode dynamics in the uy decouples from the dynamics in the other directions and the
velocity eigenvector matrix for the slow and fast waves in MHD is


(ω/k)2 − Cs2 cos2 θ
uz

(233)

This yields the MHD dispersion relations for the slow and fast mode in the form of (226) or alternatively (227). It
possible to either express the ratio ux /uz or uz /ux. We want to calculate the velocity ratio χu and we choose the first
possibility that allows us to express that for the slow and fast modes (since uy = 0)
χu (kk , k⊥ ) =

1
|uz |2
= ux 2
.
|ux |2 + |uz |2
| uz | + 1

(234)

The ratio ux /uz can be found for example from the second row of the matrix as
(ω/k)2 − Cs2 cos2 θ
ux
=

uz
Cs2 sin θ cos θ

(235)

or equivalently from the first row of the matrix as
Cs2 sin θ cos θ
ux

=
2
uz
(ω/k) − (VA2 + Cs2 sin2 θ)

(236)

35
The possible range of the ratio ux /uz is from −∞ to +∞ and the possible range for χu is from 0 to 1. Solutions can be
easily divided into two categories - depending on the behavior for parallel propagation - and are plotted in Figure 2. For
the sake of clarity, we only consider propagation with positive wavenumbers kk and k⊥ , so the possible range of angle
θ is from 0 to π/2 and sin θ ≥ 0, cos θ ≥ 0. Consider first the case Cs < VA . For parallel propagation, the dispersion
relation (227) directly yields that for the fast mode (ω/k)2f |θ=0 = VA2 and for the slow mode (ω/k)2s |θ=0 = Cs2 . Using
the expression (235) then yields that for the fast mode (ux /uz )f |θ=0 = +∞ and for the slow mode (ux /uz )s |θ=0 = 0.
This implies that for Cs < VA , all the χu (θ) curves start at
Cs < VA :

χfu (θ = 0) = 0;

χsu (θ = 0) = 1,

(237)

regardless of the actual value of Cs /VA < 1. The second case Cs > VA is straightforward, since for parallel propagation
everything is just turned around; the fast mode dispersion relation is (ω/k)2f |θ=0 = Cs2 and the slow mode dispersion
relation is (ω/k)2s |θ=0 = VA2 . Implying that for Cs > VA , all the χu (θ) curves start at
Cs > VA :

χfu (θ = 0) = 1;

χsu (θ = 0) = 0,

(238)

regardless of the actual value of Cs /VA > 1. The perpendicular propagation limit is even easier since the split into two
categories is not required and for both cases the dispersion (226) yields (ω/k)2f |θ=π/2 = VA2 + Cs2 and (ω/k)2s |θ=π/2 = 0,
implying that for the fast mode (ux /uz )f |θ=π/2 = +∞ and that for the slow mode (ux /uz )s |θ=π/2 = 0. All the χu (θ)
curves therefore “end” at
χfu (θ = π/2) = 0;
χsu (θ = π/2) = 1,
(239)
whether the ratio Cs /VA < 1 or Cs /VA > 1. The behavior of the χu (θ) curves is plotted in Figure 2.
In MHD, the ratio Cs2 /VA2 is sometimes used as the definition of plasma beta, which we will call here βMHD ≡ Cs2 /VA2 .
As can be seen in Figure 2, for βMHD approaching 1, the curves display a “singular” behavior, and it is difficult to guess
what will happen when βMHD reaches the value of 1 exactly. This special case is addressed in the next subsection.
There are also two special cases, one for Cs ≪ VA or βMHD ≪ 1 and one for Cs ≫ VA or βMHD ≫ 1. Both limits
Cs ≪ VA and Cs ≫ VA are easily obtained by rewriting the dispersion relation (226) to a form

In both limits the second term under the square root is small and the expression can be expanded as 1 − ǫ = 1 − ǫ/2,

which further yields dispersion relations (242), (244). Note that the limit Cs ≪ VA can be easily obtained directly
from the velocity matrix (233) by neglecting the off-diagonal terms that decouples the two modes. In contrast, the
limit Cs ≫ VA is not that obvious and one needs to calculate the determinant.
In the limit βMHD ≪ 1, the MHD dispersion relation simplify to
βMHD ≪ 1 :

(ω/k)2f = VA2 + Cs2 sin2 θ;

(ω/k)2s = Cs2 cos2 θ.

(242)

The expression (235) yields for the fast mode (ux /uz )f (θ) = ∞ and the expression (236) yields for the slow mode
(ux /uz )s (θ) = 0, implying
βMHD ≪ 1 :
χfu (θ) = 0;
χsu (θ) = 1.
(243)
In the opposite limit βMHD ≫ 1, the MHD dispersions simplify to
βMHD ≫ 1 :

(ω/k)2f = Cs2 + VA2 sin2 θ;

(ω/k)2s = VA2 cos2 θ.

(244)

In this limit, the expression (235) yields (ux /uz )f (θ) = (1 + VA2 /Cs2 ) tan θ, that describes the behavior of the fast mode
for large beta values and the complete limit is (ux /uz )f (θ) = tan θ. For the slow mode the expression (235) yields
(ux /uz )s (θ) = −(1 − VA2 /Cs2 ) cot θ and the complete limit is (ux /uz )s (θ) = − cot θ. The χu (θ) solutions for large beta
values therefore converge to
βMHD ≫ 1 :
χfu (θ) = cos2 θ;
χsu (θ) = sin2 θ,
(245)
and these two curves are plotted in Figure 2 as dashed lines.

Figure 2. MHD velocity ratio χu (θ) = |uk |2 /|u|2 for the slow mode (red lines) and the fast mode (blue lines) for different ratios
of Cs2 /VA2 = βM HD . The left figure is for βM HD < 1, and the thickness of the lines increases with βM HD when approaching
the critical value of βM HD = 1. The plotted lines have βM HD = 0.3; 0.6; 0.8; 0.9; 0.99. The right figure is for βM HD > 1 and
the thickness of the lines decreases with βM HD when going away from the critical value of βM HD = 1. The plotted lines have
βM HD = 1.01; 1.1; 1.2; 2.0; 10; 103 . In both figures, the dotted lines are the critical case βM HD = 1 with solutions (250). In the
right figure the dashed lines represent the limit βM HD ≫ 1 with solutions (245) and the dashed lines nicely overlap with a thin
solid line solutions obtained for βM HD = 103 . The Alfvén mode has χu (θ) = 0 regardless of plasma beta and is not plotted.

3.9.1. MHD special case VA = Cs
Consider the very peculiar case of parallel propagation θ = 0 with VA = Cs . The velocity eigenvector matrix (233),
when evaluated exactly at these values reads

   
0   ux   0 
0

(246)

It is not possible to determine the ratio ux /uz and the eigenvector must be found by taking the limit θ → 0. For
VA = Cs the dispersion relation for the slow and fast modes (227) simplifies to (ω/k)2 = VA2 ± VA2 | sin θ|. As before,
for the sake of simplicity we consider only positive wavenumbers, so the propagation angle θ is in the range [0, π/2]
and sin θ ≥ 0, cos θ ≥ 0. Evaluating the velocity matrix (233) at VA = Cs only, it is possible to pull the sin θ out of
the system so that

which nicely demonstrates that for θ → 0 the system approaches (246). Nevertheless, we can now calculate the velocity
ratio (for example from the second row) as
±1 + sin θ
ux
=

(248)
uz
cos θ
which can be evaluated at θ = 0. For the fast mode (ux /uz )f (0) = 1 and for the slow mode (ux /uz )s (0) = −1. This
implies that for the peculiar case of VA = Cs , the velocity ratio χsf
u (0) = 1/2 for both the fast and slow modes. The
expression (248) can of course be directly obtained by using the result (ω/k)2 = VA2 ± VA2 sin θ in the expression (235)
and by canceling the sin θ in the nominator and denominator. The expression (248) is valid for any angle θ. However,
for the slow mode it becomes singular at θ = π/2, and has to be rearranged by multiplying and dividing with 1 + sin θ
(or equivalently, use the first row of the matrix). To have useful expression for the entire range of θ, we therefore split
the expressions for the slow and fast modes as
(ux /uz )s = −

cos θ

1 + sin θ

(ux /uz )f =

(249)

which yields in this peculiar case of VA = Cs , that the ratio χu for the slow and fast modes can be expressed as

(1 + sin θ);

These solutions are plotted in Figure 2 as dotted lines.

abbreviated symbols, and we write the matrix (204) for the ux and uz components as

The behavior of these solutions is plotted in Figure 3, where we plot solutions for isotropic temperatures ap = 1.
Similarly to MHD, two classes of solutions can be characterized based upon the behavior for parallel propagation θ = 0,
depending if the quantity a−c (255) evaluated at θ = 0 is positive or negative. The quantity (a−c)|θ=0 = 1+ 12 ap βk −2βk
was discussed in the section for parallel propagation and this quantity represents the green dotted curve in Figure 1
that separates the system into two regions. For (a − c)|θ=0 > 0, i.e. in the region βk < 2/(4 − ap ), for the slow mode
(use eq. 257) the ratio (ux /uz )s (0) = 0 and for the fast mode (use eq. 256) the ratio (ux /uz )f (0) = +∞. In this
region, all the χu (θ) curves start at
βk < 2/(4 − ap ) :

χsu (0) = 1;

χfu (0) = 0.

(258)

38
For (a − c)|θ=0 < 0, i.e. in the region βk > 2/(4 − ap ), for the slow mode (use eq. 256) the ratio (ux /uz )s (0) = +∞
and for the fast mode (use eq. 257) the ratio (ux /uz )f (0) = 0. In this region, all the χu (θ) curves start at
βk > 2/(4 − ap ) :

χsu (0) = 0;

χfu (0) = 1.

(259)

For perpendicular propagation θ = π/2 the quantity (a − c)|θ=π/2 = 1 + ap βk is always positive and the separation
into two regions is not necessary. For the slow mode (ux /uz )s (π/2) = 0 and for the fast mode (ux /uz )f (π/2) = +∞.
All the χu (θ) curves, regardless of the value of βk therefore end at
χsu (π/2) = 1;

χfu (π/2) = 0.

(260)

This summarizes the general behavior of the solutions. However, as can be seen from Figure 3, there is a special case
when the parameters approach βk = 2/(4 − ap), i.e. when (a − c)|θ=0 = 0, that will be discussed in the next subsection.
One can again consider the two limiting cases when βk is small or large. The βk ≪ 1 case yields dispersion relations 6

Using expression (257) for the slow mode yields (ux /uz )s (θ) = 0 and expression (256) for the fast mode yields
(ux /uz )f (θ) = ∞, implying that in low beta limit the χu (θ) solutions are
βk ≪ 1 :

βk ≪ 1 :

χsu (θ) = 1;

χfu (θ) = 0,

(264)

and the constant solutions approaching this limit are visible in the plot of Figure 3. The opposite βk ≫ 1 limit in the
CGL description is not particularly revealing since there is no obvious way to simplify the expansion, even for isotropic
temperatures. For ap = 1, the βk ≫ 1 expansion yields

that is independent of βk . For the slow mode wave the dispersion relation cannot be further simplified because if we
collect only terms proportional to βk , the resulting expression will be nonzero everywhere except exactly at θ = 0 (and
also θ = π/2). For θ = 0, the entire contribution of (e
ω /e

to βk . Nevertheless, the analytic velocity ratio (268) for the fast mode is sufficiently simple and to obtain analytic
χsu (θ) for the slow mode, it is actually possible to cheat a little by realizing that the slow and fast mode curves are

3.10.1. CGL special case βk = 2/(4 − T⊥ /Tk )
In this peculiar case when all 3 modes propagate in the parallel direction with the same phase speed, one again faces
complications when calculating the velocity eigenvector, as with the MHD peculiar case when VA = Cs . This CGL
special case can be encountered only for βk ≥ 1/2 because the temperature anisotropy must be ap ≥ 0. We start with
the velocity eigenvector matrix (254) and for the special case considered 1 + 12 ap βk − 2βk = 0, the expression (255)
simplifies to a − c = (4βk − 1) sin2 θ. One can already see that for strictly parallel propagation the entire matrix will
be zero and it will not be possible to evaluate the eigenvector. Similarly to the MHD case, the sin θ can be pulled out
of the matrix or alternatively one can use (256), (257) and calculate the limit. For the special case considered here,
the parameter b = 12 (4βk − 2) sin θ cos θ. Considering again for simplicity only positive wavenumbers, the expression
(256) yields in this particular case

3.11. Empirical models with polytropic indices γk , γ⊥
The differences between MHD and CGL can be further clarified with polytropic indices. The linearized MHD
pressure equation reads
∂p
+ γp(0) (∂x ux + ∂y uy + ∂z uz ) = 0.
(273)
∂t
One can introduce the concept of polytropic indices γk and γ⊥ to the CGL pressure equations (189), (190) and write
∂pk
(0)
(0)
+ pk (∂x ux + ∂y uy ) + γk pk ∂z uz = 0;
∂t
∂p⊥
(0)
(0)
+ γ⊥ p⊥ (∂x ux + ∂y uy ) + p⊥ ∂z uz = 0,
∂t

(274)
(275)

where for the CGL model γk = 3 and γ⊥ = 2. 7 The reasoning for such a construction is to enable a smooth transition
between two extreme cases - the CGL model on one side, and the isothermal model γk = 1 and γ⊥ = 1 on the other
side. The important observation is that in the parallel pressure equation the γk acts only on the parallel velocity
component uz , and in the perpendicular pressure equation the γ⊥ acts only on the perpendicular velocity components
ux , uy . In MHD, the γ acts on all three components ux , uy , uz . The values of polytropic indices are directly related to
the number of degrees of freedom i, through the well known relation γ = (i + 2)/i. In the MHD description the number
of degrees of freedom is i = 3 and so γ = 5/3. In contrast, the CGL description can be interpreted as being composed
of a (strongly coupled) mixture of one-dimensional and two-dimensional dynamics, where for the parallel direction
i = 1 and γk = 3 and for the perpendicular direction i = 2 and γ⊥ = 2. The subtle appearing, but nevertheless
fundamental difference between (273) and (274), (275) is the core of many differences between the MHD and CGL
descriptions, such as for example the effect of the slow mode becoming faster than the Alfvén mode. The two systems
(0)
(0)
remain different even if the mean CGL pressures (or temperatures) are prescribed to be isotropic pk = p⊥ and
equal to the mean MHD pressure p(0) . This means that the MHD does not match the CGL description even if the
distribution function is isotropic, as for example Maxwellian.
We briefly consider models with polytropic indices γk , γ⊥ that are based on the linearized pressure equations (274),
(275). If these pressure equations are “un-linearized”, i.e. if one performs a “reverse engineering” procedure to obtain
a nonlinear equations (a procedure that is possible to do because of the known guidance by the CGL model), the
nonlinear equations read

Empirical fluid models of this type were studied for example by Hau & Sonnerup (1993) and Hau et al. (1993) with the
motivation that spacecraft observations in the Earth’s magnetosheath often show behavior that cannot be explained
by the CGL values of γk = 3, γ⊥ = 2 or by the isothermal values of γk = 1, γ⊥ = 1, but can be fitted by the values that
lie somewhere in between (and actually quite close to the isothermal case). For a direct comparison with the CGL
model, the equations (278) can be rewritten to a form

Obviously, for CGL values of γk = 3, γ⊥ = 2 the right hand sides disappear and one obtains the classical CGL
expressions. The right hand sides of the above expressions can be compared with equations of Chew et al. 1956
(82), (83) which contain the gyrotropic heat flux contributions. Therefore, the deviations from the CGL values of
γk = 3, γ⊥ = 2 can be considered to offer a very simple empirical model (perhaps too simple) that shows how the heat
flux contributions modify the CGL dynamics. The dispersion relations for this fluid model can be found in Hau et al.
(1993) and also in Abraham-Shrauner (1973), who studied even more general empirical model with four polytropic
indices (essentially, the γk , γ⊥ acting on |B| and ρ in (278) can be further split to two independent parameters).
Interestingly, complex polytropic indices have been suggested to model Landau damping (Belmont & Mazelle 1992).
By considering the linearized CGL equations (184)-(188) and linearized polytropic pressure equations (274)-(275)
written in the x-z plane yields the dispersion relations for this model. The Alfvén wave is still decoupled from the rest
of the system and the Alfvén wave dispersion relation is unaffected by the different pressure equations, therefore also
yielding the same oblique firehose instability threshold. What is modified is the dispersion relation of the slow and
fast waves. The velocity equations read

(290)

For γk = 3, γ⊥ = 2, the condition (289) is naturally equivalent to the CGL mirror threshold. However, the condition
offers a temptingly simple result to keep the perpendicular polytropic index unchanged γ⊥ = 2 and modify the
parallel polytropic index to γk = 1/2. In this way, the mirror threshold matches the correct kinetic threshold (210).
Nevertheless, this is just an interesting empirical concept, it fixes the highly oblique mirror threshold but at the same
time moves the slow and fast mode dispersion relations in other directions, for example the parallel sound speed in such
(0)
a model is Ck2 = 12 pk /ρ0 , which appears to be unrealistically low. Such a ’tuning’ of models with free parameters only in one particular direction and only at the level of dispersion relations - can be sometimes useful for interpretation
of observational data, however, such models will usually lead to unphysical situations. We will not consider models
with polytropic indices further in this text. Instead, to obtain a better match with kinetic description, it is advisable to
use the correct CGL values of γk = 3, γ⊥ = 2 and focus on fluid models that derive the correct heat flux contributions
qk and q⊥ .
3.12. CGL and radially expanding solar wind
Similarly to MHD, the CGL fluid model can be very useful for understanding evolutions of temperatures in the
radially expanding solar wind. A good discussion can be found for example in Matteini et al. (2007); Matteini et al.
(2013) and references therein. Let’s first consider the MHD case. Combining the pressure equation dp/dt + γ∇ · u = 0
with the density equation dρ/dt + ρ∇ · u = 0 yields
 


d

d

(291)
MHD:

dt ργ−1
which in a steady-state (or co-moving with the convective derivative) implies T ∼ ργ−1 . By considering simple radially
expanding solar wind, one prescribes that the density ρ evolves with the heliocentric distance r as ρ ∼ 1/r2 , and by
using γ = 5/3, the ideal MHD model yields (in the absence of any dissipation and associated turbulent heating)
T ∼ r−4/3 .
In contrast, the CGL equations (157) are rewritten as

(294)

For the magnetic field it is possible to consider profiles of roughly |B| ∼ 1/r2 , or |B| ∼ 1/r (one can be more precise
and consider the Parker spiral profile). The first magnetic field profile yields
|B| ∼ 1/r2 ;

=>

Tk ∼ const.;

T⊥ ∼ 1/r2 ;

T⊥

(295)

T⊥

(296)

The second magnetic field profile yields
|B| ∼ 1/r;

=>

Tk ∼ 1/r2 ;

T⊥ ∼ 1/r;

There is also a curious case when the magnetic field profile is prescribed to be |B| ∼ r−4/3 , i.e. a profile between two
cases of 1/r and 1/r2 , that yields
|B| ∼ r−4/3 ;

=>

Tk ∼ r−4/3 ;

T⊥ ∼ r−4/3 ;

T⊥

(297)

8 Note that the equation in the cited paper has opposite sign, which is not a typo, authors just call the mirror threshold a condition
when a mode is stable - opposite to a more usual condition when a mode becomes unstable. Similarly, authors write the condition for the
firehose stable region as βk ≤ 2 + β⊥ .

43
and the temperature anisotropy stays constant. The estimations are of course valid only until a firehose threshold or
a mirror threshold is reached. For example, evolution according to (295) will lead the system to a firehose threshold,
and evolution according to (296) will lead the system to a mirror threshold. In general, if we fix the density profile
to ρ ∼ 1/r2 , any magnetic field profile steeper than r−4/3 will evolve the system towards a firehose threshold, and
a magnetic field profile shallower than r−4/3 will evolve the system towards a mirror threshold. The estimations
do not reveal presence of the firehose instability or the mirror instability in the CGL model, since the solutions are
written in a steady-state, and concern only evolution of mean temperatures (i.e. the solutions should be written with
(0)
(0)
Tk , T⊥ ). To find an instability, one of course needs to consider evolution equations for fluctuating variables and
analyze associated dispersion relations, since it is the fluctuations that become unstable. Further discussion can be
found in Hunana & Zank (2017).
From a linear perspective, the CGL model has to be accompanied by the Hall term and FLR corrections, so that
the instabilities are stabilized at small spatial scales. However, considering nonlinear evolution with finite amplitudes of fluctuations, even the non-dispersive CGL model is stabilized. For example, considering parallel propagation
Tenerani et al. (2017) has shown that the firehose instability criterion reads (see eq. 9 in that paper)

(298)

i.e., for infinitely small amplitudes of the magnetic field, the usual firehose criterion is obtained. However, when the
CGL system reaches firehose unstable regime and the amplitude of fluctuations starts to grow, the firehose criterion
is modified according to (298). Therefore, the amplitude of fluctuations can not grow without bounds, and beyond
some critical amplitude, the system becomes again stabilized. The condition (298) nicely demonstrates how the CGL
system is stabilized during nonlinear evolution, once the firehose instability is reached. For further discussion, see
Tenerani et al. (2017); Tenerani & Velli (2018).
To finish this subsection, the heuristically generalized CGL model with polytropic indices γk , γ⊥ yields that in the
steady state the mean temperatures evolve according to

3.13. CGL model - summary
The usual “combining” of evolution equations (by performing ∂/∂t and substituting one equation to another) is very
useful to gain insight into the linear eigenmodes of a considered system. However, for more advanced fluid models,
such a procedure can become very analytically involved, and it is much easier to calculate the determinant of the entire
system with analytic software, such as Maple or Mathematica. Therefore, for more advanced fluid models we often do
not write down the final dispersion relation for arbitrary propagation angle (which might be uneconomically large to
write down), and we only provide normalized, linearized in the x-z plane and Fourier transformed equations. For easy
comparison with more advanced fluid models, it is beneficial to write the final CGL equations in the same form. It
is useful to work in normalized units, and we drop writing the tilde. The normalized, linearized in the x-z plane, and
Fourier transformed CGL equations read

4. HALL-CGL MODEL

Here we consider a slightly generalized CGL model when the Hall-term is included in the induction equation.
Concerning the isotropic Hall-MHD model, a good comparison with solutions of kinetic thoery can be found for
example in Howes (2009). Before we proceed with the discussion of dispersion relations, we want to point out how
the Hall-term and the electron pressure contributions and the electron inertia contributions modify the usual “CGL
conservation equations” for protons. The general electric field was already written down in (131). For a moment it is
beneficial to consider this most general form including the electron inertia and the electron pressure contributions and
separate the electric field into two parts

The notation EH is perhaps slightly misleading since only the first term in (309) is usually called the Hall electric
field. Note that the first term in EH still has to be used in the proton momentum equation even for the simplest CGL
(or MHD) models. The induction equation then reads
∂B

which is then rewritten with the use of convective derivative as

4.1. Hall-CGL model with cold electrons
Here we want to study the simplest Hall-CGL model for the proton species. We neglect the electron inertia and we
make the electrons cold with pe = 0. The full model is described by the usual CGL equations (152)-(155), but the
induction equation now reads

These equations replace the ∂B/∂t equations in the linearized CGL system written in the x-z plane. And the trouble
is immediately apparent. In contrast to the CGL system, we are no longer able to separate the Alfvén mode which
was before exclusively in the By , uy components. Now all the components are coupled and all three modes, the
Alfvén mode, the slow mode and the fast mode are coupled. This is not surprising, since the same situation is in the
Hall-MHD. In this case, we have no other choice and we have to calculate the dispersion relation for all three modes.
The dispersion relation can be solved analytically only for special cases and in general, the dispersion relation has to
be solved numerically. Let’s quickly consider the two special cases of parallel and perpendicular propagation that can
be solved analytically.

where importantly, the kk2 = |kk | was used. The solution (335) is the whistler mode, and the solution (336) is the

ion-cyclotron mode. For isotropic temperatures (ap = 1), the result is equal to the Hall-MHD dispersion relation. At
long wavelengths (kk → 0) the solutions become non-dispersive and connect to the usual CGL Alfvén modes. For
parallel propagation, the Hall-term is therefore responsible for splitting the two modes that otherwise would propagate
at the same speed, while it does not influence the ion-acoustic mode. Or in another words, using the vocabulary of
slow, Alfvén, fast, depending on plasma βk and temperature anisotropy ap , the Hall-term either splits the parallel
propagating Alfvén and fast mode, or the slow and Alfvén mode. At very short spatial scales (kk ≫ 1), the limits are

For isotropic temperatures ap = 1 the frequency of the ion-cyclotron mode (that should be actually called the protoncyclotron mode) converges towards the proton cyclotron frequency ±Ωp . For anisotropic temperatures, the frequency
of the mode starts to be βk dependent and will converge to frequencies that can be higher or lower than the Ωp . The
frequency of the whistler mode is not bounded and technically goes to infinity, which is a consequence of neglecting the
electron inertia. Importantly, both modes are stable for high wavenumbers. The solutions (335), (336) are analytically
correct, but similarly to the Hall-MHD, the solutions can be rewritten to a more useful form, by realizing that the
dispersion equation (334) can be decomposed as 10

It is straightforward to check that (ω −ωW,1 )(ω −ωW,2 ) = 0 yields the whistler mode solution (335), and (ω −ωIC,1 )(ω −
ωIC,2 ) = 0 yields the ion-cyclotron mode solution (336). Often, solutions (339)-(342) are written in an alternative
form where the absolute value on kk is removed (which obviously can be done), and the solutions are just slightly
re-arranged. Additionally, for more complicated fluid models, we want to write solution in one line instead of four
lines. In this example, we just write a shortcut that two solutions are

with another two solutions obtained by substituting ω with −ω.
4.2.1. Firehose instability
β

Now we can discuss the firehose instability. If the quantity 1 + 2k (ap − 1) > 0, then all the solutions (339)-(342) have
frequencies that are purely real for the entire range of wavenumbers. For isotropic temperatures ap = 1, the dispersion
relations do not depend on the value of βk , which is a consequence of neglecting the FLR pressure corrections as will
be discussed later, and all solutions are equivalent to the Hall-MHD dispersion relations. Solutions (339)-(342) with
ap = 1 are plotted in Figure 4 left panel, where we plotted both positive and negative wavenumbers and positive and
negative frequencies to clearly understand how the modes are connected to each other. The magenta and cyan lines
are plotted as dashed lines, so that the growth rates in the firehose-unstable regime (plotted in Figure 5) are clearly
visible. For anisotropic temperatures ap 6= 1, the solutions are naturally βk dependent. To show solutions in a fire-hose
unstable regime, one has to choose βk > 2 since the instability does not exist for lower values of βk . In Figure 4, right
panel, we have chosen a value of βk = 4 and varied the temperature anisotropy from ap = 2 down to a critical value
of ap = 0.5. In this regime, all the modes have purely real frequencies.
Importantly, if the temperature anisotropy parameter ap is further decreased, the frequencies of all the modes will
become complex numbers (with a real and imaginary part) in the region where

which can be viewed as a modified Hall-CGL firehose instability threshold that is now length-scale dependent. At
long spatial scales (kk → 0), the above criterium is naturally equivalent to the CGL firehose criterium. The term
proportional to kk2 in (344) is always positive and as kk increases, after some critical wavenumber the frequency of
modes will become purely real. The Hall-term is therefore responsible for the stabilization of the firehose instability
at sufficiently high wavenumbers (small spatial scales). The solutions in this firehose unstable regime are plotted in
Figure 5, where again βk = 4 and the temperature anisotropy is varied from ap = 0.49 to the lowest possible value of
ap = 0.0. The left panel shows real frequencies and the right panel shows imaginary frequencies.
It is of interest to determine, which mode becomes unstable. According to our Fourier transform (see Appendix A),
a mode with positive imaginary frequency is unstable and growing, and a mode with negative imaginary frequency
is stable and damped. If the firehose threshold (344) is satisfied, for some range of kk the second terms in solutions
(339)-(342) become purely imaginary and the first terms stay purely real. Consider one of the four possible quadrants
in the Figure 5 left, for example the quadrant with kk > 0; ωr > 0. Up to some critical kk where the Hall-CGL

Figure 5. Dispersion relations for the Hall-CGL model (with cold electrons), for parallel propagation θ = 0, with fixed βk = 4,

after crossing the firehose threshold ap = T⊥ /Tk < 0.5. The color coding of lines is according to (339)-(342). The thickness of
the lines decreases as going away from the threshold ap = 0.5. Left panel: real frequency and the curves have ap = 0.49; 0.2; 0.0.
Right panel: imaginary frequency and the curves have ap = 0.4; 0.2; 0.0. The mode with ap = 0.49 shown in the left panel has
the imaginary part of the frequency which is very close to zero for the entire range of kk . For this reason this mode is not
plotted in the right panel, where instead a mode with ap = 0.4 is plotted. A mode that has Im ω > 0 is unstable and growing
in time. A mode that has Im ω < 0 is stable and damped. According√to the figure, whistler modes with ωr > 0 are unstable,
and ion-cyclotron modes with ωr < 0 are unstable. It is assumed that −1 = +i. The solutions for ωr < 0 are here non-causal,
and the right panel should be re-plotted with causal solutions (350)-(353), so that whistler modes are always unstable, and
ion-cyclotron modes stable.

50
firehose criterium is satisfied, both the blue mode and the cyan mode propagate with the same real frequency ωr =
+kk2 VA2 /(2Ωp ). The differences are in the imaginary frequency, see Figure 5 right, where in this quadrant the blue mode
is unstable and the cyan mode is stable (and damped). After a critical kk (for example for ap = 0 it is kk VA /Ωp = 2),
both modes become purely real and evolve with different real frequencies, here the blue mode is obviously the whistler
mode and the cyan mode is the ion-cyclotron mode. The same situation is in the quadrant kk < 0; ωr > 0. We can
therefore conclude that for positive real frequencies, ωr > 0, the whistler mode is unstable and the ion-cyclotron mode
is stable and damped.
Now we could say that considering both positive and negative wavenumbers and frequencies is redundant, and that
we are finished. However, from a perspective of this guide, we consider useful to show that one might easily come
into contradictions, if negative frequencies are not handled with sufficient care. Importantly, according to Figure 5,
for negative real frequencies ωr < 0, the whistler mode is stable and the ion-cyclotron mode is unstable. This is
indeed contradictory. Keeping the kk > 0, a change from positive to negative ωr represents a change of direction of
propagation along B0 . One can argue, that in a homogeneous system (e.g. excluding propagation in a stratified fluid),
a change of direction of propagation should not yield a change of stability. Additionally, kinetic theory and simulations
show, that it is the whistler mode that is firehose unstable for both ωr > 0 and ωr < 0, and the ion-cyclotron mode
is stable. It is important to emphasize that from a perspective of solutions (339)-(342), at the range of wavenumbers
where the firehose instability is present, the whistler and ion-cyclotron modes propagate (in a given quadrant) with
the same real frequency. Moreover, both modes have the same polarization of electric and magnetic field (see Section
4.2.3). Both modes are completely degenerate, and not distinguishable. Thus,
√ how the modes are continued for higher
wavenumbers once the firehose instability disappears, is not obvious (since −1 can be possibly both +i or −i). One
should consider all the possible solutions and verify, which solutions are physically plausible. Therefore, after the
firehose threshold is crossed, the analytic solutions (339)-(342) are not correctly separated. Obviously, more “physical
information” is needed to distinguish between the ion-cyclotron and whistler modes in the firehose unstable regime,
and to determine which solutions are causal and which are non-causal.
4.2.2. Generalization to causal (correct) solutions
The mind boggling puzzle, why the Hall-CGL solutions (339)-(342) are in contradiction to kinetic theory and to
common sense (a discrepancy found by one of the Referees of this text), was beautifully solved by Paul Cally. The
easiest way to obtain correct solutions is to introduce a very small “causal” dissipation into the system, and remove it
later. Alternatively, it should be possible to obtain the same result by using Laplace-Fourier transforms on temporalspatial scales and considering an initial value problem.
We introduce causality, by adding a tiny amount of dissipation on the right hand sides of momentum equations
(326)-(327), in the following form

where ǫ is a dimensionless real small positive number, for example ǫ = 10−8 . The dissipation will be later completely
removed by the limit limǫ→0+ . The VA2 /Ωp is there so that the parameter ǫ is indeed dimensionless (since here we
usually normalize with respect to VA and Ωp , but other normalizations can be of course considered). The factor of
2 is there for pure convenience, so that the final dispersion relations (350)-(353) are of the utmost beauty, and that
we don’t have to later redefine ǫ. The momentum equations are accompanied by the induction equations (328)-(329).
The reader is encouraged to verify the calculations by switching to normalized variables kek = kk VA /Ωp , ω

and similar generalizations can be done for models with FLR corrections. Then, since ǫ is small, it is easy to show
that the non-causal solutions (339)-(342) are “corrected” by the tiny dissipation to the following causal form

The reader is encouraged to plot these solutions, for example with ǫ = 10−8 , and verify that the right panel of Figure
5, is indeed corrected. I.e., that the whistler is unstable for both ωr > 0 and ωr < 0. We want to further address the
limits. For clarity, let’s first consider the following simplest case
√
ǫ
lim −1 ± iǫ = ± i,
(354)

2
ǫ→0
where
√ one can further suppress the small real ǫ/2 on the right hand side. The limit (354) provides an answer, when
the −1 is equal to +i or −i. The result (354) can be easily generalized, and limits in expressions (350)-(353) are
calculated according to

Obviously, the whistler solutions (351), (352) are unstable, and the ion-cyclotron solutions (350), (353) are damped.
Only now we can conclude with confidence, that the parallel firehose instability as an instability of the whistler mode.
We note that if instead of the momentum equations, we added the dissipation (diffusivity) to the induction equations,
the solutions (350)-(353) are recovered with ǫ → −ǫ. I.e., by adding a dissipation to the induction equations, the
whistler mode would be always damped and the ion-cyclotron mode unstable. The result makes sense with respect
to kinetic theory, since the ion-cyclotron resonances enter through the velocity moment
P(by integration over the
perturbation of the distribution function f (1) ), or more precisely through the current j = r qr nr ur , see Part 2.
4.2.3. Polarization

The polarization of the magnetic field can be easily checked, actually without plugging any dispersion relations into
the matrix (333), since the matrix can be represented simply as

kk2 and b = VA2 kk2 ω/Ωp . It is useful to define the polarization as the angle between the complex Bx
where a = ω 2 − vAk
and By components, which is calculated as Arg(By /Bx ). If the result is smaller than zero, the wave is left polarized.
If the result is larger than zero, the wave is right polarized. The determinant of the matrix (356) is a2 − b2 = 0, so
a = ±b. The case a = −b (which is directly equal to the first bracket in (338) with solutions (339), (340)) yields that

the words left/right polarized are usually meant for the E field. The ratio Ey /Ex can be easily calculated, for example

52
from equations (381), (382) (written there in the normalized form), which when multiplied by ω and use of momentum
equations, yields for the special case of parallel propagation considered here

When plotting many solutions, it is useful to additionally divide the angle by π, and define the B and E field
polarizations as

PB = Arg ;

Electric field polarization defined this way was used for example by Hunana et al. (2013) to investigate properties of
(highly oblique) kinetic Alfvén waves in various fluid models and kinetic description; and also by Camporeale & Burgess
(2017) who compared various linear modes in hybrid, gyrokinetic and fully kinetic descriptions. 11 When PE < 0
the wave is called left polarized and when PE > 0, the wave is called right polarized. For the first group (357) this
yields Ey /Ex = −i and PE = −1/2 < 0 (left polarized wave), and for the second group (358) Ey /Ex = +i and
PE = +1/2 > 0 (right polarized wave).
Finally, it is of interest to note another possible definition of polarization, that is defined with respect to positive
real frequency, i.e. the electric field polarization (360) is redefined to
PE =

Ey
sign(ωr )
Arg .
π
Ex

(361)

A similar definition of polarization with sign(ωr ) is used for example in the book by Gary (1993), page 91. With such
a definition, the whistler mode is always right polarized, both in the firehose-stable and firehose-unstable regimes, since
for the whistler mode (341, blue line) the real frequency remains ωr > 0, and for the whistler mode (340, magenta line)
ωr < 0. The situation is more confusing for the ion-cyclotron mode, where the firehose-stable and firehose-unstable
regimes have to be considered separately. 1) In the firehose-stable regime, both ion-cyclotron modes are left polarized,
since for the mode (339, green line) ωr > 0, and for the mode (342, cyan line) ωr < 0. 2) In contrast, in the firehoseunstable regime, both ion-cyclotron modes are right polarized, since for the mode (339, green line) ωr < 0, and for the
mode (342, cyan line) ωr > 0.
4.2.4. Simplest ion-cyclotron resonances
When talking about “resonances”, one often expects to see expressions with a denominator that becomes zero.
Generally speaking, the simplest “singular” expressions representing resonances just arise from a technique used in
deriving the dispersion relations. If one eliminates the electric field E from the beginning and expresses the fluid
model through a matrix multiplied by a vector (ρ, ux , uy , uz , bx , by , bz , pk , p⊥ ), leads to dispersion relations that are
not singular explicitly. In contrast, expressing the model through a matrix multiplied by a vector (Ex , Ey , Ez ), yields
equivalent dispersion relations where the resonances are shown explicitly. The dispersion equation (338) can be easily
rewritten as

which, in the cold plasma limit (βk = 0) or in this case also for isotropic temperatures (ap = 1), simplifies to

Ωp /VA2

ω − Ωp

kk2

(363)

making it more evident that we have the simplest ion-cyclotron resonances here too. Indeed, for k → ∞ the frequency
ω → Ωp (first case) and ω → −Ωp (second case). For a plasma with finite βk and nonisotropic temperatures, the
k → ∞ limit yields more general ion-cyclotron resonances (337).
To better understand what effects are present and what effects are absent in the Hall-CGL model, we plot fully
kinetic solutions obtained with the WHAMP code in Figure 6. The proton temperature is prescribed to be isotropic
T⊥ /Tk = 1 and the electrons are prescribed to be cold with Te /Tp = 0 (in the WHAMP code, the value is chosen to
be 10−8 ). In the WHAMP code it is necessary to prescribe the ratio of the parallel proton thermal speed to the speed

11 Similar definition was used by Sahraoui et al. (2012), who however plot a bit confusing Arg(E )/π, since in the WHAMP code the
y
electric field is normalized so that Arg(Ex ) = 0.

Figure 6. Left panel: Comparison of solutions of full kinetic theory obtained with the WHAMP code (solid lines) and the

simple dispersion of the Hall-CGL model (dashed lines) for the whistler mode (blue) and the ion-cyclotron mode (green). The
proton temperatures are isotropic T⊥ /Tk = 1, electrons are cold and the angle of propagation θ = 0. Real frequency is plotted.
The βk is varied as βk = 10−4 ; 0.1; 1; 2; 4. The kinetic solutions show that while the frequency of whistler mode is not much βk
dependent (only the case βk = 4 is slightly different), the frequency of the ion-cyclotron mode is strongly βk dependent since
the mode experiences strong damping. The Hall-CGL model has only the simplest ion-cyclotron resonance, and the Hall-CGL
ion-cyclotron mode matches the kinetic ion-cyclotron mode only for the lowest βk = 10−4 . Right panel: Solutions of the
Hall-CGL-FLR2 model are plotted. Note that the real frequency of the ion-cyclotron mode is crudely reproduced.

blue curve is the whistler mode and the green curve is the ion-cyclotron mode. Solutions of the Hall-CGL model are
shown in the left panel of Figure 6 and, for isotropic temperatures the solutions are completely βk independent and
are represented with two dashed curves. It is shown that the kinetic solutions for the whistler mode are almost βk
independent and only the mode with βk = 4 deviates from the other whistler solutions, and only between kdi = 0.1−2.0.
For comparison, in the right panel of Figure 6 we plot solutions of the Hall-CGL-FLR2 model (the model is discussed
later in the text).
4.3. Hall-CGL dispersion relation for arbitrary propagation angle
To make everything as clear as possible, let’s write down one more time the normalized equations we are solving,
including the linearized and Fourier transformed equations in the x-z plane. The nonlinear Hall-CGL equations with
cold electrons are (dropping the tilde)
∂ρp

Linearizing in normalized units is even easier, because (temporarily introducing back the tilde for clarity) the pekp = 1;

e0 = 1. Linearizing these equations, writing them in the x-z plane, and Fourier transforming yields

−ωBz + k⊥ Ey = 0,

(380)

−ωBy − k⊥ Ez + kk Ex = 0;

and in this case with cold electrons the electric field components are
Ex = −uy − ik⊥ Bz + ikk Bx ;

(381)

Ey = ux + ikk By ;

(382)

Ez = 0.

(383)

The induction equation (378)-(380) with the above electric field components is of course equivalent to the induction
e = E/E0 , where
equation (373)-(375). All equations are normalized, the tilde are dropped, and the electric field E
E0 = VA B0 /c. The Hall-CGL dispersion relation reads

ω = ± 3βk /2kk . For perpendicular propagation (kk = 0), the fast mode solution is ω = ±k⊥ 1 + ap βk , which is
equivalent to CGL since the Hall-term disappears.
We investigated solutions of the Hall-CGL model in much greater detail in our paper “On the Parallel and Oblique
Firehose Instability in Fluid Models” (Hunana & Zank 2017), a paper which was essentially pulled out of this guide.
We do not want to repeat the discussion with many associated figures here, and a reader who is further interested in
the Hall-CGL firehose instability can find much more information in that paper.

5. FLR CORRECTIONS TO THE PRESSURE TENSOR

The finite Larmor radius (FLR) corrections to the pressure tensor can be derived in several levels of approximation.
The pressure tensor equation (50) can be rewritten as
i
1 B0 h ∂p
(387)
+ ∇ · (up + q) + p · ∇u + (p · ∇u)T .
b̂ × Π + (b̂ × Π)T = −
Ω |B| ∂t

This equation is exact and since p = pg + Π, the FLR tensor Π is described implicitly.
5.1. Fully nonlinear FLR corrections

If preservation of all nonlinearities is desired, this implicit equation can be further rewritten by the following procedure that can be found for example in Hsu et al. (1986); Passot & Sulem (2004); Ramos (2005) as a brief note. By
applying b̂× to the left hand side, the first term calculates
[b̂ × (b̂ × Π)]ij = ǫikl b̂k (b̂ × Π)lj = ǫikl b̂k ǫlrs b̂r Πsj = (δir δks − δis δkr )b̂k b̂r Πsj = b̂k b̂i Πkj − b̂k b̂k Πij
|{z}
=1

= b̂i b̂k Πkj − Πij ,

(388)

where we have used that ǫikl ǫlrs = δir δks − δis δkr . The second term on the left hand side of (387) calculates quite
differently and we will need an identity
ǫikl ǫjrs = δij (δkr δls − δks δlr ) − δir (δkj δls − δks δlj ) + δis (δkj δlr − δkr δlj ).

(389)

Let’s also remind ourselves that in the index notation Πss = TrΠ = 0 and b̂k b̂l Πkl = Π : b̂b̂ = 0. The second term
calculates
[b̂ × (b̂ × Π)T ]ij = ǫikl b̂k (b̂ × Π)T
lj = ǫikl b̂k (b̂ × Π)jl = ǫikl b̂k ǫjrs b̂r Πsl = ǫikl ǫjrs b̂k b̂r Πsl

(398)

The expression (398) is completely general since no simplifications were introduced, the expression is exact. However,
the equation is still implicit, since on the right hand side the tensor κ contains the full pressure tensor p = pg + Π.
Nevertheless, the equation is extremely useful, once the expansion of the r.h.s. is performed, as we will do below. Note
that the brackets are not unique, since

b̂ × κ · I + 3b̂b̂ = b̂ × κ · I + 3b̂b̂ = b̂ × κ · I + 3b̂b̂ ,
(399)

where the last choice leaves the brackets unspecified (since both options are allowed), similarly to b̂ · ∇u. Alternatively,
one can get rid off the operator ·I (which acting on a matrix yields the same matrix), and split the result into two
parts
S 3

(400)
Π = b̂ × κ + b̂ × κ · b̂b̂ .

Another possible form can be obtained by subtracting the evolution equations for the gyrotropic pressure components
∂pk /∂t and ∂p⊥ /∂t. The scalar pressure equations were derived by applying : b̂b̂ and : (I − b̂b̂)/2 on the pressure
tensor equation. The subtraction can be formally represented by introducing “overbar” projection operator ā that
projects any (3 × 3) matrix a to
ā = a − [a : b̂b̂]b̂b̂ − [a : (I − b̂b̂)/2](I − b̂b̂).

(401)

The definition is of course motivated by the pressure decomposition (46). By applying this operator on (396), the l.h.s.
remains the same, yielding (b̂ × Π)S = −κ̄. The solution (398) for the FLR tensor therefore rewrites

iS
1h
.
(402)
b̂ × κ̄ · I + 3b̂b̂

The subtraction of scalar pressure equations is motivated by the observation, that when working in the linear approximation directly with equation (396), i.e. without performing the inversion procedure, the scalar pressure equation
have to be subtracted at the end. However, by performing the inversion procedure, the scalar pressure equations are
subtracted “automatically” during calculations, and it is actually easier to work directly with (398) instead of (402).
Therefore, let’s work with (398). The leading-order nonlinear FLR corrections are obtained by neglecting the nongyrotropic contributions Π and q ng on the right hand side of (398), i.e. by prescribing

κ(1) =
Ω |B| ∂t
Therefore, the only non-gyrotropic quantities that were retained on the r.h.s. of (398), are the perpendicular components of the velocity u. The slightly unappealing factors B0 /|B| in all the expressions can be removed, by redefining
the cyclotron frequency with |B| instead of B0 , so that Ω|B| = e|B|/(mc). Let’s calculate (403) step by step. For the
brevity of calculations, it is useful to introduce convective derivative d/dt = ∂/∂t + u · ∇ and work with

∇(q⊥ b̂) . However, calculating the rest of the expression according to (403) simplifies several terms, and for example
all terms in the third line of (411) vanish. The terms in the 3rd line containing b̂i b̂j vanish after applying b̂×, since
(b̂ × (b̂b̂))ij = ǫikl b̂k b̂l b̂j = 0. The terms in the 3rd line containing δij vanish after applying the symmetric operator

derived in the Appendix of that paper in a somewhat simpler way. In Schekochihin et al. (2010), instead of our
notation for matrix W and vector w, the symbols S and σ are used, where S = W and σ = −w. We wanted to
avoid the use of S and σ, since these symbols are typically used when decomposing the heat flux tensor. For a reader
who just jumped to this result, the symmetric operator is defined as ASij = Aij + Aji . For clarity, for any vector w

The last identity follows from an identity for general matrix A, that reads (b̂ × A)T = −AT × b̂, and for a matrix
A = B · C the AT = C T · B T , implying (b̂ × B · C)T = −C T · B T × b̂.

The nonlinear solution for the FLR tensor Π can be further re-arranged. For example, to obtain the form reported

The solution (435) has a nice advantage that it is decomposed with respect to the magnetic field lines. I.e. projecting
the Π along the field lines by performing Π · b̂ cancels the first term, and directly yields vector b̂ × h/Ω|B| , that could

5.1.1. Employing non-dispersive induction equation
Considering the long-wavelength low-frequency limit, the solution (429) for vector w and the solution (437) for vector

the following form (see later in the text)

The result (441) can be further rewritten with vorticity ω = ∇ × u, by using identity (∇u) · b̂ − b̂ · ∇u = b̂ × (∇ × u) =
b̂ × ω, finally yielding

Results (435), (436), (442) are equivalent to eq. 49-51 of Ramos (2005) (see also eq. 11-13 of Macmahon (1965)).
Further evaluation of nonlinear FLR corrections to higher precision is out of scope of this simple guide, and the
interested reader is referred to Ramos (2005). We will continue in a much simpler linear approximation.

5.2. Simplest FLR corrections (FLR1)
We could continue by evaluating the obtained nonlinear results in the linear approximation. However, the nonlinear
FLR calculations were quite complicated and it is very useful to clarify, how to derive the simplest FLR corrections
directly in the linear approximation. Let’s start again, and work with the general equation (387). To derive the
simplest finite Larmor radius corrections to the pressure tensor, one has to cancel the Π contributions on the right
hand side of (387) and also neglect the heat flux contributions, which yields
i
1 B0 h ∂pg
b̂ × Π + (b̂ × Π)T = −
(443)
+ u · ∇pg + pg ∇ · u + pg · ∇u + (pg · ∇u)T .
Ω |B| ∂t

Considering complete linearization (so that we can easily go to Fourier space), this is equivalent to performing expansion
to the first order in frequency ω/Ω and to the first order in wavenumber rL k. We do not want to perform complete
linearization just yet. However, to move further, we introduce simplification by not evaluating the FLR corrections
along the magnetic field lines, but along the ambient magnetic field B0 that is prescribed to be in the z-direction,
and therefore b̂ = (0, 0, 1) ≡ b̂0 . This simplification typically used in numerical simulations is appropriate if the
magnetic field lines are not too distorted with respect to the mean magnetic field. Here we will distinguish between
complete linearization and evaluation along b̂0 . However, it is important to note that the procedure of evaluating some
terms with b̂0 , while other nonlinearities are kept, is of course not a fully consistent procedure. With the approach
presented here, the only fully consistent procedure that simplifies the general equation (387), is complete linearization.
Additionally, as discussed by Passot et al. (2014), neglecting magnetic field line distortion may in some instances lead
to spurious instabilities.
Let’s evaluate (443) along b̂0 . On the left hand side we calculate each component in the matrix separately. Since
(b̂ × Π)ij = ǫikl b̂k Πlj , it is obvious that non-zero contributions are obtained only if b̂k = b̂z = 1, so the index k = z,
and (b̂ × Π)ij = ǫizl Πlj . Now, for example the ′ xx′ component calculates (b̂ × Π)xx = ǫxzl Πlx and the only nonzero
contribution is obtained for index l = y, which yields (b̂ × Π)xx = ǫxzy Πyx = −ǫxyz Πyx = −Πyx = −Πxy , where in the
last step we used that the FLR tensor is symmetric. The entire left hand side [b̂ × Π + (b̂ × Π)T ]ij = ǫizl Πlj + ǫjzl Πli
and it is straightforward to calculate each component, which yields

The second term in (447) contributes because of the induction equation ∂B/∂t = −c∇ × E. For now, we will not use
the induction equation and keep our FLR calculations in the above form. Let’s continue with the second term on the
r.h.s of (443). When completely linearized this term does not contribute, but for now we will keep it and combine it
with the first term into a convective derivative ∂pg /∂t + u · ∇pg = dpg /dt, so that ∂/∂t in (447) is replaced by d/dt.
The remaining terms on the r.h.s. of (443) are straightforward to evaluate since no derivatives of b̂ are encountered,
and the third term pg ∇ · u b̂=b̂0 is equal to matrix (445) multiplied by ∇ · u. The last two terms of (443) are together

However, since the FLR tensor was derived with a precision to only first order in wavenumber k, to make everything

which is equivalent to equation 5 of Yajima (1966). Perhaps surprisingly, the result is also equivalent to the highly
collisional eq. (2.20)-(2.24) of Braginskii (1965), after one prescribes pk = p⊥ and after terms containing the collisional
time τ are “ignored” (τ ∼ 1/ν where ν is the usual collisional frequency). A proper collisionless limit τ → ∞ can not
be obtained from the expressions of Braginskii (1965), since the results are proportional to τ (and also 1/τ ).
Furthermore, evaluation along b̂ = (0, 0, 1) basically means that the magnetic field terms of the system were linearized
and other parts of the system were not. The expansion procedure preserved some nonlinearities, but other nonlinearities
that are of the same order were implicitly neglected. Therefore, the only fully consistent procedure is to evaluate the
FLR tensor in the linear approximation, yielding

and the result is consistent with eq. 17 of Yajima (1966), after neglecting the electron inertia in that paper (by

(476) is also equal to eq. 34 of Del Sarto et al. (2017), who discuss in detail that compared to solutions of a truncated
kinetic Vlasov system, and also of a fluid model with more precise FLR corrections, the solution (476) actually has

an opposite sign in front of the FLR term ∼ k⊥
. For further refinement with FLR2, see eq. (500) and the subsequent
discussion.

For strictly perpendicular propagation the solution is equivalent to (476) since the Hall contributions vanish.
5.5. 2nd-order FLR corrections (FLR2)
If a more precise FLR corrections are desired, it is relatively easy to increase the precision to the second order in
frequency ω/Ω while keeping the precision in wavenumber krL at first order. The pressure tensor equation (387) is
simplified to
i
1 B0 h ∂ g
b̂ × Π + (b̂ × Π)T = −
(482)
(p + Π) + ∇ · (upg + q g ) + pg · ∇u + (pg · ∇u)T .
Ω |B| ∂t

For clarity, let’s first consider the case with the heat flux q = 0. Compared to the first-order FLR corrections in the
∂
previous section, we just have one more matrix present, ∂t
Π. As before, the FLR tensor must be symmetric and
also satisfy conditions Πzz = 0 and Πyy = −Πxx . Following the previous derivation, the system (450) now includes
also the time derivative of the FLR tensor on the right hand side. Let’s write down the system directly in the linear
approximation. The system reads

The FLR components could be considered as independent fluid quantities described by the time-dependent equations
as written above. However, from a linear perspective this introduces additional linear modes, and from direct numerical simulations perspective it is preferred not to introduce additional four time-dependent equations (nevertheless,
numerical simulations with the full pressure tensor equation are sometimes performed, see e.g. Wang et al. (2015);
Del Sarto et al. (2016); Ng et al. (2017)). The above equations are therefore typically simplified by expanding the
FLR tensor to the first and second-order as Π = Π(1) + Π(2) and the time derivative of the second-order tensor is

where we also used the linearized induction equation in the last two equations. Now there are two possibilities to
handle the Hall-term contributions coming from the induction equation. It is possible to either define Π(1) to be equal
to set (458) and move the Hall-term to Π(2) , or it is possible to keep the Hall term in Π(1) that is equal to linearized
set (456). The first choice, i.e. if Π(1) is set (458) yields the second-order components

The difference between the two approaches therefore is that the first approach neglects the time derivative of the
Hall-term. It is noted that the second approach is not necessarily better or more accurate than the first approach.
For example for parallel propagation, the frequency of the whistler mode seems to be better described by the first
approach and the solutions are closer to kinetic theory.

where for cold (and massless) electrons in the x-z plane
(∇ × EH )x = +kk2 By ;

(∇ × EH )y = kk k⊥ Bz − kk2 Bx ;

(∇ × EH )z = −kk k⊥ By .

(495)

We purposely wrote the equations with EH so that the generalization to a more elaborate electric field will be
straightforward. Note that the Hall contributions (495) in the FLR tensor completely vanish for isotropic temperatures
ap = 1, regardless of the form of EH , i.e. regardless if the electrons are cold or not.
To write down the solution for parallel propagation (k⊥ = 0) it is useful for brevity to introduce the following

Importantly, in comparison to FLR1 solution (476), the FLR2 solution (501) has an opposite sign in front of the FLR

. The equation (501) is equivalent to eq. 32 of Del Sarto et al. (2017), obtained by solving the pressure
tensor equation without the expansion to Π(1) and Π(2) , and by expanding for small wavenumber afterwards. The
difference between the FLR1 solution (476) and the FLR2 solution (501) is perhaps even more clear, when written in
physical units for ω and k, and by using the gyroradius ρi = vth⊥ /Ωp , in the following form

Equations (502), (503), (504) are eq. 34, 32, 56 of Del Sarto et al. (2017). As discussed in that paper, the FLR1 model
does not only fail to capture the correction to the Alvén velocity, it also introduces correction to the thermal velocity
with incorrect sign. The kinetic result can be obtained for example from eq. 2.10 of Mikhailovskii & Smolyakov (1985),
when written for cold electrons (βe = 0), and rewritten to our notation (thermal speed in that paper does not have a
factor of 2, so (ρ2i )(MS) = ρ2i /2).
Coming back to the generally oblique propagation, the second approach to write the FLR2 tensor, i.e. when the
time derivative of the Hall term is not neglected and kept in the first-order tensor Π(1) with components

For isotropic temperatures (ap = 1) the result is equivalent to (498) since the Hall term contributions for the FLR
tensor disappear for all propagation directions. Also, for perpendicular propagation, the dispersion relation is naturally
equal to (500).

(∇ · q )zz = ∂z qk + (qk − 2q⊥ )∇ · b̂,

where in the last ’zz’ component we also used ∂z b̂z = 0, but for brevity we left the divergence ∇ · b̂ = ∂x b̂x + ∂y b̂y
intact in all expressions. Note that (∇ · q g )yy 6= −(∇ · q g )xx , which is not a problem as will be described below. The
pressure tensor equation is here approximated as
i

∂(pg + Π)
+ ∇ · (upg + q g ) + pg · ∇u + (pg · ∇u)T + Ω b̂ × Π + (b̂ × Π)T = 0,
∂t

(516)

and evaluated with respect to b̂ = b̂0 = (0, 0, 1). All components were already evaluated and the calculation is
straightforward, however, we need to subtract from diagonal components the scalar pressure equations that contain
the gyrotropic heat flux contributions and that evaluated along b̂0 read
dpk

dp⊥
+ 2p⊥ ∇ · u − p⊥ ∂z uz + ∂z q⊥ + 2q⊥ ∇ · b̂ = 0.

(517)
(518)

The requirement again is that Πzz = 0 and Πyy = −Πxx . Direct calculation yields
∂
Πxx − 2ΩΠxy + p⊥ (∂x ux − ∂y uy ) + q⊥ (∂x b̂x − ∂y b̂y ) = 0;
∂t

∂t
dt

(519)
(520)
(521)
(522)

Note that after subtraction of the perpendicular pressure equation, the ′ xx′ and ′ yy ′ components are again antisymmetric, i.e. (∇ · q g )yy − ∂z q⊥ − 2q⊥ ∇ · b̂ = −q⊥ (∂x b̂x − ∂y b̂y ), and the system indeed satisfies that Πyy = −Πxx .
Also, considering the ′ zz ′ component, after subtraction of the parallel pressure equation all the terms cancel, i.e.
(∇ · q g )zz − ∂z qk − (qk − 2q⊥ )∇ · b̂ = 0 and the system indeed satisfies Πzz = 0.
Finally, expressing the above system in the linear approximation, with the assumption that mean heat flux values are
(0)
(0)
zero, i.e. qk = 0, q⊥ = 0, the only gyrotropic heat flux contributions that remain are ∂x q⊥ and ∂y q⊥ , in equations
(521), (522). The FLR tensor is again separated to Π(1) + Π(2) and similarly to the Hall-term contributions, it is
again a matter of choice if the heat flux contributions are pushed to Π(2) or kept in Π(1) . We prefer the first choice,

69
i.e. when Π(1) is equivalent to (458), which yields the second order tensor

Note that we could have derived the contributions ∂x q⊥ and ∂y q⊥ in a much quicker way, if the expression (509) was
linearized from the beginning. However, we wanted to demonstrate that if nonlinear FLR corrections are considered, the
heat flux nonlinearities can significantly complicate the dynamics, even if simplified evaluation along b̂0 is performed.
Right now, we can not use these FLR corrections to obtain a dispersion relation, since we have no means to determine
a closure for the gyrotropic heat flux q⊥ . We would have to consider CGL2 fluid model or more complicated Landau
fluid models, that contains evolution equations for qk and q⊥ . Additionally, the perpendicular propagating fast mode,
as well as the parallel propagating ion-cyclotron and whistler modes, are not influenced by the gyrotropic heat flux.
Instead, as the last step, we will consider contributions of the non-gyrotropic heat flux.
5.8. FLR corrections with non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors (FLR3)
It is possible to further increase precision of the FLR corrections by considering non-gyrotropic heat flux contribuk

tions. Detailed calculations with the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors S⊥ and S⊥
are presented in the Appendix D.
At the linear level, these non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors contribute to the linearized pressure equations

These equations are equivalent to equations 18-21 of Goswami et al. (2005) (by noting that the vector S ⊥ = q⊥ b̂ + S⊥

where the gradients are meant to be further linearized. Nevertheless, the above form is useful to point out that
the non-gyrotropic heat fluxes are proportional to the gradients of the temperature. For clarity, partially linearized
expressions are also written down by components in the Appendix D, see equations (D40), (D41) and (D75), (D76).
It is important to emphasize that the expressions (531), (532) were derived for a bi-Maxwellian distribution function.
As discussed later in the text, this is achieved by prescribing closures for the gyrotropic 4th-order moment in the
3p2

p p

2p2

form rkk = ρk + rekk , rk⊥ = kρ ⊥ + rek⊥ , and r⊥⊥ = ρ⊥ + re⊥⊥ . In (531), (532), we additionally neglected the
perturbations re (since right now we do not want to consider models where these perturbations are evaluated from

70
linear kinetic theory). Therefore, the FLR corrections with the non-gyrotropic heat flux, that we call here FLR3, are
distribution function specific. Nevertheless, as discussed later in the text, very similar closures can be also obtained for
the bi-Kappa distribution function, just with additional coefficients ακ = (κ − 3/2)/(κ − 5/2), and expressions similar
to (531), (532) can be derived.
The second-order vectors are also derived in the Appendix D, this time directly in the linear approximation, eq.

Rather amusingly, in comparison to the FLR2 result (503), the wrong sign in the correction of the thermal speed is

Obviously, if matching with kinetic theory for the fast perpendicular mode is of upmost importance (for small

Importantly, the Π(2) expressions contain both the 1st and 2nd order contributions from the heat flux vectors S⊥ ,

. To explicitly see where the closure for the gyrotropic heat fluxes qk = 0, q⊥ = 0 was performed, we scratched the

the linear level.

Therefore, the Hall-CGL-FLR3 fluid model finally matches the analytic result from kinetic theory! We note that if
the Π contributions are neglected in the second-order heat flux expressions (546), instead of the correct −5/16 FLR
correction to the thermal speed, one obtains −7/16. The necessity to keep the second-order heat flux contributions to
recover the kinetic result for the perpendicular fast mode was discovered by Mikhailovskii & Smolyakov (1985).

6. PARALLEL AND OBLIQUE FIREHOSE INSTABILITY

6.1. Parallel propagation
For clarity, it is useful to summarize all 3 major models that describe the parallel propagating ion-cyclotron and
whistler modes. By prescribing k⊥ = 0 in the equations of the Hall-CGL-FLR3 fluid model, the model greatly
simplifies. The parallel magnetic field Bz = 0, the ion-acoustic mode decouples, and both the first and second order
⊥
contributions to Πxx = 0, Πxy = 0, S⊥
= 0. The normalized, Fourier transformed equations written in the x-z plane

Importantly, the solutions are written here for ω (and not ω 2 ), and all the models of course yield 4 solutions, the other
two solutions are obtained by substituting ω with −ω. For a reader who just jumped to this section, and is confused
on how the solutions were split, see section 4.2 where the Hall-CGL model is discussed with final equation (343). The
solutions can be written in various forms, and one possibility is to keep |kk | in front of the square roots.

The (parallel and oblique) firehose instability was studied in detail by Hunana & Zank (2017), who focused on the
Hall-CGL and Hall-CGL-FLR1 models. One of the conclusions reached in that paper was that the main reason for the
relatively large discrepancy between usual fluid models and kinetic description is the appearance of a huge “bump”
in the imaginary phase speed, when close to the firehose threshold. The situation is demonstrated in Figure 7, where
kinetic solutions obtained by the WHAMP code (blue solid lines) are compared to solutions of the Hall-CGL-FLR2
model (left figure, blue dashed lines) and the Hall-CGL-FLR3 fluid model (right figure, black dashed lines). The plasma

Figure 7. Imaginary phase speed (growth rate normalized to the wavenumber) of the parallel firehose instability. The βk = 4,

and temperature anisotropy is varied so that the whistler mode is in the firehose unstable regime. Solid lines (blue) are kinetic
solutions, obtained with the WHAMP code. Dashed lines are fluid solutions. Left figure: FLR2 solutions (blue), Right figure:
FLR3 solutions (black). It is shown that in contrast to the FLR2 model, the FLR3 model reproduces the large “bump” when
close to the long-wavelength “hard” firehose threshold T⊥ /Tk = 0.5.

βk = 4, so the long-wavelength firehose threshold, that we call “hard threshold”, is at ap = 0.5. The temperature
anisotropy is varied from ap = 0 to ap = 0.501. For solutions with the Hall-CGL and Hall-CGL-FLR1 models see
Figure 3 and 4 of Hunana & Zank (2017). In the WHAMP code the value of ap = 0 cannot be used, and ap = 10−4
was chosen instead. Also, since here we concentrate on proton dynamics, the influence of electrons in the WHAMP
code was eliminated by making the electrons cold (with Te /Tp = 10−8 ).
Very surprisingly, Figure 7 shows that the large “bump” is reproduced by the FLR3 model, and the precision is
quite good! The situation is further analyzed in Figure 8, where instead of the imaginary phase speed, the growth
rate is plotted. The same conclusion is obtained. For the temperature anisotropy ap = 0.501, all simpler fluid models
(Hall-CGL, FLR1, FLR2) are fully stable for all range of wavenumbers. In contrast, the FLR3 model still develops a
k
strong firehose instability. Therefore, it is the non-gyrotropic heat flux S⊥ of the FLR3 model that is responsible for the
“bump” (for the case of strictly parallel propagation). The appearance of the “bump” can be understood analytically,
by evaluating the fluid dispersion relations exactly at the “hard” firehose threshold ap = 1 − β2k , where the quantities
β

= 0 and vb = 1 + 2k . At the hard firehose threshold, the expression under the square root of the FLR2 solution

implying that the FLR2 model is always stable for all values of kk and βk . Such a factorization can not be achieved
for the FLR3 model, and the solution (558) still becomes unstable at some range of wavenumbers, where

which is the (strictly parallel) firehose instability criterium of the FLR3 model. We note that the model can become
unstable also for the temperature anisotropy ap > 1. This can be perhaps considered as some remnant of the
ion-cyclotron anisotropy instability, but we did not study the situation further since the instability should not be
reproduced correctly. The parallel firehose instability for high plasma beta value βk = 100 is shown in Figure 9. The

Figure 8. Same parameters as in Figure 7, but the growth rate is plotted, and linear scale is used for the x-axis. Notice the

excellent precision of the FLR3 model for small wavenumbers up to kdi = 0.1 − 0.2. In comparison to kinetic theory, the fluid
solutions are stabilized much more “rapidly”. Nevertheless, the value of the maximum growth rate, and the wavenumber where
the maximum growth rate is achieved, is surprisingly close to kinetic theory. This is an excellent result for a fluid model, which
does not contain collisionless ion-cyclotron damping.

left Figure is from Hunana & Zank (2017), and it shows solutions of the Hall-CGL model (blue dashed lines) and of
the Hall-CGL-FLR1 model (green dashed lines). The kinetic solutions are blue solid lines. It is shown that the FLR
corrections are crucial for the correct stabilization of the firehose instability. The right Figure 9 shows refinement
with FLR2 (blue dashed lines) and FLR3 tensors (black dashed lines). Obviously, for high plasma beta values, the
maximum growth rate of the (strictly) parallel firehose instability is captured very precisely by the Hall-CGL-FLR3
model. The maximum growth rate (for parallel propagation) can be easily found analytically only for the Hall-CGL

6.2. Oblique propagation
Here we briefly investigate the parallel and oblique firehose instability for oblique propagation directions. Contour
plots of the growth rate in (k, θ) plane are shown in Figure 10. The plasma βk = 4 and the temperature anisotropy
ap = 0.49, so all the fluid models are in the firehose unstable regime. We compare four different fluid models, Hall-CGL
(top left), and enhancement with FLR1 (top right), FLR2 (middle left) and FLR3 (middle right). The FLR2 solution
shows an additional instability at higher wavenumbers that we did not study further. Note the large differences
between the four solutions. Importantly, the FLR3 solution shows large enhancement of the growth rate. We use the
WHAMP code for kinetic calculations, and we do not provide contour plot for the kinetic theory. Instead, we plot the
growth rate for several propagation angles, so that the comparison with the contour plots can be made easily. The
bottom left figure is the FLR3 model, and the bottom right figure is the kinetic result. It is noted that similarly to
other fluid models with higher-order FLR corrections, the FLR3 model can develop secondary instabilities at scales
below the proton gyroscale.
6.3. Hellinger’s contours for Hall-CGL-FLR3 model
Here we prescribe a fixed value for the maximum growth rate, γmax = 10−3 ; 10−2 ; 10−1 , and plot solutions in the
(βk , ap ) plane, which is shown in Figure 11. The left panels show the parallel firehose instability, and the right panels
show the oblique firehose instability. The top panels are plotted with the usual logarithmic scales, and the bottom
panels with linear scales. Additionally, only solutions with βk < 6 are shown at the bottom panels. Solutions for the
Hall-CGL-FLR3 fluid model are black dashed lines, and kinetic solutions are solid blue lines (left panels) and solid
red lines (right panels). The kinetic solutions were provided to us by P. Hellinger (private communication) and are
identical to solutions shown in Figure 1 of Hellinger et al. (2006). It is shown that the γmax = 10−3 ; 10−2 contours
clearly lie below the hard firehose threshold, i.e., the firehose instability in the FLR3 fluid model develops at some
range of wavenumbers, even if the model is stable in the long-wavelength limit. Importantly, the kinetic contours of
Hellinger et al. (2006) were not calculated for cold electrons, but for isotropic electrons with βe = 1. This does not
matter for the parallel propagation, since isotropic electron pressure does not influence the dispersion relations for
the parallel propagating whistler and ion-cyclotron modes. Only the effect of electron inertia will enter, however, the
effect should be negligible at the scales considered here. Unfortunately, the solution for the parallel firehose instability
can not be further improved by currently developed fluid models. The oblique case is different, since even isotropic
electron pressure will influence the dynamics. The contours for the oblique firehose instability should be therefore
recalculated by using a proper proton-electron two fluid model. The oblique case could be further improved, by
considering FLR contributions from the non-gyrotropic heat flux tensor σ that were neglected here (contributions for
parallel propagation are zero). For the oblique case, one can also use higher-order fluid models with the gyrotropic
heat flux fluctuations qk , q⊥ (such as the CGL2 model discussed later), or even Landau fluid models. The main reason
for the relatively large discrepancies found in the contours for the parallel firehose instability is demonstrated in Figure
12.

Figure 12. Parallel firehose instability, βk = 4. It is shown that the Hall-CGL-FLR3 model (black dashed lines) indeed develops

firehose instability even for values of ap > 0.5, i.e. when there is no instability in the long-wavelength limit. Nevertheless, by
increasing the value of ap beyond 0.5, the growth rate in the FLR3 model quickly falls off, and the instability disappears for
ap > 0.5317. In contrast, kinetic theory (blue solid lines) develops strong firehose instability even at ap = 0.6.

7. HEAT FLUX TENSOR EQUATION

Multiply the Vlasov equation by mci cj ck and integrate over the velocity space. Naturally, the other possibilities are
to multiply by mci cj vk , mci vj vk or mvi vj vk , but none of them is more revealing and we will use the first choice. It is
convenient to define the symmetric operator S that acts on a tensor of third rank according to
ASijk = Aijk + Ajki + Akij ,

i.e. the operator represents all possible cyclic permutations. For the first term we will need the following identities

Note again that the divergence of a tensor operates through its first component ∂l (rlijk + ul qijk ) = [∇ · (r + uq)]ijk .
Similarly, if the operator acts on a tensor from the right hand side, the most natural way is to define that it operates
through the last component, i.e. [q · ∇]ij = qijl ∂l . In the expressions above [q · ∇u]ijk = qijl ∂l uk and [pu · ∇u]ijk =
(pu)ijl ∂l uk = pij ul ∂l uk . The last term can also be rewritten as pij (u · ∇u)k , where the expression (u · ∇u)k = ul ∂l uk

7.1. Heat flux tensor decomposition

Considering only the gyrotropic part of the heat flux tensor (3 × 3 × 3) cube, the heat flux is decomposed to the
scalar parallel and perpendicular heat flux components qk , q⊥ according to


q g = qk b̂b̂b̂ + q⊥ (I − b̂b̂)b̂ ,

= qk b̂i b̂j b̂k + q⊥ δij b̂k + δjk b̂i + δki b̂j − 3b̂i b̂j b̂k .

(588)

This part of the pressure tensor represents only the gyrotropic part, and the full heat flux decomposition can be written
0
as q = q g + q ng . In the heat flux tensor equation, the term B × q is proportional to the cyclotron frequency Ω = qB

We will address the non-gyrotropic heat flux contributions in the Appendix D.
In a similar fashion to the pressure decomposition (35), we are going to frequently apply double contractions with
b̂b̂ and (I − b̂b̂)/2. Applying these operators on the heat flux tensor qijk , must yield quantities that are vectors. It is
therefore logical to define parallel and perpendicular heat flux vectors
S k ≡ q : b̂b̂;

S ⊥ ≡ q : (I − b̂b̂)/2.

(598)

The scalar parallel and perpendicular heat flux components qk , q⊥ (which are the only parts that are gyrotropic) are
obtained by further projecting these heat flux vectors along the magnetic field lines, i.e. by performing ·b̂, so that
qk = (q : b̂b̂) · b̂;

q⊥ = (q : (I − b̂b̂)/2) · b̂.

(599)

Briefly considering only the gyrotropic heat flux (588) on the right hand side, it is easy to verify that the parallel
decomposition indeed works

which verifies that the perpendicular decomposition (599) is satisfied for q g . Now we apply the decomposition (599)

(611)

The decomposition (599) obviously works for the entire heat flux q, as well as for the gyrotropic part q g . Similarly to
the pressure decomposition, this further yields required properties that the non-gyrotropic heat flux q ng must satisfy.

83
By using (599), the entire heat flux decomposition reads

q = qk b̂b̂b̂ + q⊥ (I − b̂b̂)b̂ + q ng ;


S
q = (q : b̂b̂) · b̂ b̂b̂b̂ + (q : (I − b̂b̂)/2) · b̂ (I − b̂b̂)b̂ + q ng .

(612)
(613)

Obviously, it would be useful to introduce a triple-contraction operator and instead of (q : b̂b̂) · b̂ to write something
.
like q .. b̂b̂b̂, but we do not want to introduce new notations. Also, an alternative and perhaps prettier expression is
to move the ·b̂ to the left hand side, as (q : b̂b̂) · b̂ = b̂ · q : b̂b̂, but we will keep the first choice. By applying : b̂b̂ and
·b̂ at the above equation yields
(q : b̂b̂) · b̂ = (q : b̂b̂) · b̂ + (q ng : b̂b̂) · b̂,
(614)
implying the first requirement for the non-gyrotropic heat flux
(q ng : b̂b̂) · b̂ = 0.

(615)

Similarly, the second requirement is obtained by applying : (I − b̂b̂) and ·b̂, yielding
(q ng : (I − b̂b̂)) · b̂ = 0.

(616)

By using the first requirement, the second requirement simplifies to
(q ng : I) · b̂ = Trq ng · b̂ = 0,

(617)

where obviously the trace and ·b̂ operators commute. The two requirements in the index notation read
ng
qiik
b̂k = 0.

ng
qijk
b̂i b̂j b̂k = 0;

(618)

Instead of decomposing q = q g + q ng , an alternative and very useful decomposition of the entire heat flux tensor reads
q = S + σ,

(619)

with the requirement σ : b̂b̂ = 0 and σ : (I − b̂b̂) = 0 (or equivalently σ : I = 0). The heat flux vectors (598) therefore
satisfy S k = S : b̂b̂ and S ⊥ = S : (I − b̂b̂)/2. The heat flux vectors contain both gyrotropic and non-gyrotropic
contributions. Since the gyrotropic contributions are obtained by projecting these vectors along the magnetic field
lines qk = S k · b̂, q⊥ = S ⊥ · b̂, it is useful to introduce the following decomposition
k

S k ≡ qk b̂ + S⊥ ;

⊥
S ⊥ ≡ q⊥ b̂ + S⊥
.

(620)

⊥
The vectors S⊥ , S⊥
are referred to as the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors, and their algebra is addressed in the

Appendix D. Here we only state that the q ng can be decomposed to vectors S⊥ , S⊥
and tensor σ according to

The entire heat flux tensor σ is of course non-gyrotropic.
Now we need to verify the heat flux contributions (72), (73) that we used in the pressure equations (74), (75). To
calculate the heat flux contributions to the pressure equations, we will need

The left hand side of the above equation can be also written naturally as (∇ · q g ) : (I − b̂b̂)/2, which is consistent
with an alternative derivation of the perpendicular pressure equation, where instead of doing Trace and subtracting
the parallel pressure equation, one can directly perform : (I − b̂b̂)/2.

7.4. Scalar heat flux equations continued
The parallel and perpendicular heat flux equations (636), (654) contain expressions for the 4th-order moment r, and
even though we will consider this moment in detail in the next section, here we want to finish the derivation of the
scalar heat flux equations, and we write down the required expressions. Similarly to the pressure tensor and the heat
flux tensor, the 4th order moment can be decomposed to its gyrotropic and non-gyrotropic part, r = r g + r ng . The
gyrotropic part r g is decomposed according to (680), and it can be shown (see later in the text), that direct calculation

Exact nonlinear expressions for Qng
are
k and Q⊥ that represent contributions from the non-gyrotropic heat flux q
calculated in the Appendix D, see eq. (D122), (D132). The scalar heat flux equations (658) and (659) are completely
general at this stage, since no distribution function was prescribed yet, and no simplification was introduced. These
equations are exact.
Nevertheless, equations (658), (659) are very complicated, and at this stage, it is beneficial to simplify. One possibility, is to cancel all the non-gyrotropic contributions Π, q ng and r ng , and we will study such fluid models later.
Another possibility, is to keep only those non-gyrotropic terms, that have some non-zero contribution at the linear
level. This eliminates the last term in the second line of (659) that is proportional to [. . .] · Π · b̂. Also, by following
ng
derivations in the Appendix D, it is easy to show that the terms Qng
k , Q⊥ (that represent the non-gyrotropic heat flux
q ng ), do not contribute at the linear level. Therefore, the heat flux equations simplify

Still, no specific distribution function was assumed. However, to evaluate the non-gyrotropic r ng , and correctly
evaluate possible cancellations with terms containing Π, we need to use r ng decomposition (721). Importantly, the
decomposition (721) is valid only for perturbations around a bi-Maxwellian distribution function. By keeping only
terms that have non-zero contribution at the linear level, see equations (726), (728) later in the text, the r ng terms
are evaluated as

Importantly, both non-gyrotropic contributions in the parallel heat flux equation (660) completely cancel out! The
cancellation demonstrates the importance of keeping the non-gyrotropic r ng , if one wants to keep the non-gyrotropic
Π. Also, there is a partial cancellation in the perpendicular heat flux equation (661). The heat flux equations therefore
read

The last term can be evaluated with respect to the mean magnetic field, and assuming that b̂0 is in the z-direction,
the term is equal to pρ⊥ (∂x Πxz + ∂y Πyz ), since Πzz = 0. Essentially, the term should be written in a fully linearized

form ρ⊥0 (∇ · Π) · b̂0 , since other non-gyrotropic nonlinear terms were neglected. It is important to emphasize that it
is because of this one term, that the equations (664), (665) are valid only for perturbations around a bi-Maxwellian
distribution function. If the term is neglected, i.e. if one neglects from the beginning the non-gyrotropic contributions
in (660), (661), the heat flux equations are valid for perturbations around any distribution function. We will consider
bi-Kappa distribution function later.

8. FOURTH-ORDER FLUID MOMENT

R
The algebra of the fourth order fluid moment r = m ccccf d3v can be quite intimidating at first, since the moment
is a 4D cube (3x3x3x3). We are not going to derive the time evolution equation for this moment step by step,
nevertheless, later in the text we derive the evolution equation of the n-th order fluid moment X (n) , see eq. (873),
and therefore for n = 4, the equation reads

(672)

The symmetric operator “S” is here defined as

Here we are not that interested in the evolution equation for r, we just want to clarify its decomposition, that we
need in the heat flux equations. The definition of gyrotropy means that the integral has to be evaluated only over
combinations of (vk − u⊥ ) ≡ ck and |v⊥ − u⊥ |2 ≡ c2⊥ . For the 4th moment r, there are obviously only 3 possibilities:
c4k , c2k c2⊥ and (c2⊥ )2 , and these gyrotropic components will be called rkk , rk⊥ and r⊥⊥ . We have already seen that the
double contractions with b̂b̂ and (I − b̂b̂)/2, were very useful operators to extract the gyrotropic components for the
lower order moments, p and q. To obtain any scalar quantity from the 4th moment, we obviously need to apply two
double contractions. There are 3 possibilities: we can apply b̂b̂ twice, we can apply b̂b̂ and (I − b̂b̂)/2, or we can apply
(I − b̂b̂)/2 twice. Not surprisingly, these double contractions with r indeed extract the 3 possible gyrotropic parts, as
it is easy to verify

We are now ready to guess how to write the decomposition of the gyrotropic 4th order moment. Motivated with the
previous decompositions, it obviously has to be something in the form of

Sym

Sym
,
r g = rkk b̂b̂b̂b̂ + rk⊥ b̂b̂(I − b̂b̂)
+ r⊥⊥ (I − b̂b̂)(I − b̂b̂)

(676)

where we still did not determine how the symmetric operator acts here. Importantly, the symmetric operator “Sym”
is not equivalent to the symmetric operator “S” that cycles all the indices around, eq. (672). The fluid hierarchy
obviously needs two symmetric operators, one unique “S” that is used to derive the evolution equation of a given fluid
moment X (n) , and one non-unique “Sym” that is used for the decomposition of that fluid moment. The determination
of how “Sym” acts here is not that obvious. Nevertheless, one can consider in how many ways one can extract the
gyrotropic components from the rijkl . For the rkk , one does two double contractions with (b̂b̂). The possible choices
are (b̂b̂)ij (b̂b̂)kl ; (b̂b̂)ik (b̂b̂)jl and (b̂b̂)il (b̂b̂)jk , however, all of these choices are equivalent. To obtain the rk⊥ , we
perform double contractions with (b̂b̂) and (I − b̂b̂)/2, where the last operator
contains a function δij . How many

and all of them are non-equivalent. The symmetric operator acting in the second term therefore has 6 components

(678)

Lastly, to obtain the r⊥⊥ component, one applies two double contractions with (I − b̂b̂)/2 that results in combinations
of δij δkl . How many possibilities do we have ? Obviously, there are 6 possibilities for the first delta function,
which by pairing with the other delta function in a way that indices are not repeated, yields together 6 possibilities
δij δkl ; δik δjl ; δil δjk ; δjk δil ; δjl δik ; δkl δij . However, 3 possibilities have an equivalent pair, δij δkl = δkl δij ; δik δjl = δjl δik
and δil δjk = δjk δil and there are only 3 non-equivalent combinations. The symmetric operator acting on the last term
in (676) can be determined to be
i

Sym 1 h
(I − b̂b̂)(I − b̂b̂) ijkl = (I − b̂b̂)ij (I − b̂b̂)kl + (I − b̂b̂)ik (I − b̂b̂)jl + (I − b̂b̂)il (I − b̂b̂)jk

(694)

which verifies (656), (657).
Furthermore, by exploring the ∂r/∂t equation (671), at frequencies that are much smaller than the gyrofrequency,
the gyrotropic part of r should satisfy
(b̂ × r g )S = 0,
(695)
in the same way that the gyrotropic parts of p and q satisfied this requirement. By using the gyrotropic (680), it is
easy to calculate for example

and by adding together all the 4 representations of the “S” operator, one can indeed verify that all the terms cancel,
yielding (695). By decomposing the entire 4th order moment to its gyrotropic and non-gyrotropic part
r = r g + r ng ,
the evolution equation (671) can therefore be rewritten as

8.1. Non-gyrotropic r ng

Basic properties of the non-gyrotropic tensor r ng can be easily determined with a similar procedure as those we used
for the non-gyrotropic pressure Π and the non-gyrotropic heat flux q ng . The decomposition of the entire 4th-order
moment is

and the meaning of the “Sym” operators were specified by (678), (679). By using definitions (673), (674), (675) for
rkk , rk⊥ , r⊥⊥ in the expression above, the full decomposition reads

Now, by applying : b̂b̂ twice on both sides of the equation yields r : b̂b̂ : (b̂b̂) = r : b̂b̂ : (b̂b̂) + r ng : b̂b̂ : (b̂b̂),

implying r ng : b̂b̂ : (b̂b̂) = 0, which can be also rewritten as
b̂b̂ : r ng : b̂b̂ = 0.

(701)

92
Similarly, the other two properties are derived by either applying : b̂ and : (I − b̂b̂), or twice : (I − b̂b̂), yielding
(I − b̂b̂) : r ng : b̂b̂ = 0;

(I − b̂b̂) : r ng : (I − b̂b̂) = 0,

(702)

which by using the property (701) are further reduced to
I : r ng : b̂b̂ = 0;

I : r ng : I = 0.

(703)

The last two properties can be also written as Trr ng : b̂b̂ = 0, TrTrr ng = 0. Finally, writing all 3 properties in the
index notation

and then expand the r.h.s. similarly to we did for the non-gyrotropic Π (and also the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors
in the Appendix D). However, the equation does not seem to yield anything useful. Instead, one needs to consider a
specific example of a bi-Maxwellian distribution function.

The double factorial (n − 1)!! = 1 · 3 · 5 · · · (n − 1), with (−1)!! = 1. The identity (710) is easily obtained by performing
differentiation ∂/∂α of the first result in (709), and this technique is useful in the calculation of fluid moments.
To get more familiar with the bi-Maxwellian distribution, it is useful to verify if integrals over f0 indeed yield the
expected fluid moments. Since the macroscopic velocity u is independent of v, changing from variable v to c just
yields d3 v = d3 c (similarly to substitution y=x+constant that yields dy=dx). We use notation d3 c = dck d2 c⊥ and
d2 c⊥ = dcx dcy . Also, because the integrals are evaluated from −∞ to ∞, substitution from v to c does not change
these bounds. Integration in velocity space therefore yields

It is important to emphasize, that the zero heat flux values were obtained by assuming some prescribed equilibrium f0 ,
here bi-Maxwellian. A crucial principle used in constructing fluid models with higher-order moments is that the specific
f0 is assumed only for the last retained moment. Indeed, if one closes the hierarchy by prescribing qk = 0, q⊥ = 0, the
CGL fluid model is obtained. However, to go higher in the fluid hierarchy, evolution equations for qk and q⊥ cannot
be eliminated, even if the hierarchy will be eventually closed, for example at the 4th-order moment level, by assuming
a bi-Maxwellian f0 . Or in another words, the zero heat flux values were obtained for a distribution function that is
strictly f0 , however, fluctuations/perturbations around f0 are still allowed. Therefore, to obtain the next available
model after the CGL, the heat flux equations must be retained, and a closure is performed on the 4th-order moment.
Only this last moment is calculated by assuming specific distribution function, that is strictly f0 . For a bi-Maxwellian,
the gyrotropic 4th-order moments are calculated according to

8.3. Bi-Maxwellian non-gyrotropic r ng contributions
Let’s consider a specific case of a bi-Maxwellian distribution function. Then, an expansion procedure analogous to
the one developed by Grad (1949) for rarefied gases can be used, where the distribution function is expanded in a series
of Hermite polynomials. By keeping only first few terms, one can express the 4th-order moment through 2nd-order
(pressure) moments. The procedure is written down in Oraevskii et al. (1968), and the entire 4th-order moment can
be decomposed in the following way: see equation (2.31) in Oraevskii et al. (1968) (where a small typo on the l.h.s.
is present, where instead of qαβγǫ , there should be qαβγδ ), equation (24) in Goswami et al. (2005), equation (9) in

(721)

and where terms Πij Πlk + Πik Πjl + Πil Πjk were neglected. By using pgij = pk b̂i b̂j + p⊥ (δij − b̂i b̂j ), it can be indeed
shown by direct straightforward calculation that the gyrotropic part

This agrees with the decomposition (680) valid for a general distribution function, after one specifies that for a bi3p2

Maxwellian distribution rkk = ρk , rk⊥ = kρ ⊥ , and r⊥⊥ = ρ⊥ (last term in (680) has there r⊥⊥

Now it is possible to calculate the non-gyrotropic contributions r ng , by using equation (721). It is useful to precalculate the trace of (721) that reads


ρriikl = (pk + 6p⊥ )Πkl + 2(pk − p⊥ )b̂i b̂k Πil + b̂l Πik .

It is useful to summarize the fully nonlinear model that we want to consider here. We consider only proton species,
and we make the electrons massless and cold. We simplify the pressure equations, by neglecting the FLR stress forces
(which enter only nonlinearly), and we keep only those non-gyrotropic contributions in the pressure and heat flux
equations that have a non-zero contributions. The nonlinear model reads

To develop a vocabulary, let’s first consider the above fluid model with all the non-gyrotropic fluctuations neglected, i.e.
k
⊥
when all the terms with Π, S⊥ , S⊥
are neglected. Additionally, let’s neglect the Hall-term in the induction equation.
Such fluid model is non-dispersive, and represents generalization of the non-dispersive CGL model. Even though
such fluid model was not explicitly considered by Chew, Goldberger and Low, the pressure equations that include the
gyrotropic heat flux contributions qk , q⊥ , were indeed given by Chew et al. (1956). As discussed previously, the authors
just used a different notation with qn = qk − 3q⊥ and qs = q⊥ , but their pressure equations contain the gyrotropic heat
flux. The authors did not consider evolution equations for the gyrotropic heat fluxes, eq. (736), (737). Nevertheless,
the name CGL is so well recognized by the community, i.e. the name CGL is essentially recognized as the collisionless
MHD, that we suggest to call the non-dispersive fluid model that used the above gyrotropic heat flux equations, as
the “the 2nd-order CGL”, abbreviated as “CGL2”. The name CGL2 has a nice advantage, that the abbreviations for
many models considered previously, can be easily and naturally generalized.
The CGL2 fluid model does not contain any dispersive effects and it is length-scale invariant, similarly to the CGL and
MHD models. If the Hall term in the induction equation is considered, yields the “Hall-CGL2” model. Considering
also the first-order FLR corrections to the pressure tensor (FLR1) or the second-order corrections (FLR2), yields
the “Hall-CGL2-FLR1” and the “Hall-CGL2-FLR2” fluid models. Finally, considering the non-gyrotropic heat flux
k
⊥
fluctuations S⊥ , S⊥
, yields the Hall-CGL2-FLR3 model. Fluid models with the Hall term neglected, can be easily
abbreviated as the “CGL2-FLR1”, “CGL2-FLR2” etc. Even though, if the dispersive effects by the FLR corrections
are considered, there is really no reason to neglect the simple Hall-term, and such fluid models are discouraged to use.
Obviously, the name “CGL2” is extremely beneficial and very natural for the classification of fluid models, and we will
use this name henceforth.
(0)
It is important to correctly normalize the heat flux, and the normalization is according to qek,⊥ = qk,⊥ /(pk VA ), so
both the parallel and perpendicular heat flux are normalized the same way (similarly, both pk and p⊥ are normalized
(0)
with respect to pk ). By dropping the tilde, the scalar pressure equations (734), (735) remain unchanged, and the
normalized nonlinear heat flux equations read

9.1. CGL2 dispersion relation

⊥
Neglecting all the dispersive effects, by prescribing Π = 0, S⊥ = 0, S⊥
= 0, and eliminating the Hall term in
2
the induction equation (i.e. terms proportional to ik in the above induction equation), yields the CGL2 model. By
exploring the system, it is obvious that the Alfvén mode separates from the system in the uy , By components. The
dispersion relation of the Alfvén mode in the (non-dispersive) CGL2 model is therefore the same as in the CGL model,
and reads (the normalization tildes are dropped)
r
βk
(751)
ω = ±kk vAk = ±k cos(θ) 1 + (ap − 1).
2
The “hard” threshold of the oblique firehose instability is therefore the same as in the CGL model, and correctly
reproduced. The entire dispersion relation for the CGL2 fluid model can be written in the following form

The CGL2 fluid model therefore contains 5 forward and 5 backward propagating modes. The oblique Alfvén mode
is separated as stated above, and is incompressible. The remaining 4 forward and 4 backward waves are generally
compressible and coupled together through the 8th-order polynomial in ω (4th-order polynomial in ω 2 ). Let’s ignore
for a moment the distinction between the forward and backward modes, since these will always be symmetric in ω.
The CGL2 model contains 5 waves/modes. The oblique Alfvén mode is separated, and the remaining 4 compressible
modes are in general strongly coupled. In contrast to the simpler CGL (and MHD) model, that contains only 2
compressible modes (slow and fast), we therefore have 2 “new” modes, that do not have an analogy in the usual CGL
& MHD descriptions. There is no standardized vocabulary on how the modes should be called, perhaps an expression
of “higher-order modes” is the most appropriate. For the highly oblique propagation, considering the mirror instability,
sometimes an expression of “mirror modes” is used. Nevertheless, since none of the 4 compressible modes match the

97
slow and fast CGL dispersion relations, the distinction between modes becomes blurry. The reader has to get used to
the fact that by considering higher-order fluid moments, we perhaps came closer to the kinetic theory, which admits an
infinite number of modes that are difficult to classify, unless a specific situation is considered. The difference between
CGL2 model and kinetic description is, that unless a firehose or mirror instability threshold is reached, the fluid modes
are un-damped.
For strictly parallel propagation (k⊥ = 0), in addition to the parallel Alfvén mode (751) ω = ±kk vAk that was
already separated, the solution of the 8th-order polynomial contains another Alfvén mode ω = ±kk vAk , which was
of course expected and is equivalent to the CGL model, since the components ux , uy , Bx , By de-couple for parallel
propagation. The remaining solutions are

Solutions (757) and (758) can be obtained by considering pure 1D geometry (where p⊥ and q⊥ disappear since the
kinetic velocity v⊥ disappear) and considering only fluctuations in quantities ρ, uz , pk , qk . The qk heat flux fluctuations
p
in the CGL2 fluid model are therefore responsible for “splitting” of the CGL ion-acoustic mode ω = ±kk 3βk /2 to
two modes (757) and (758).
Considering solutions for strictly perpendicular propagation (kk = 0), the only non-zero mode is the fast mode
q
(760)
ω = ±k⊥ 1 + ap βk ,

and the dispersion relation is unchanged from the CGL model (for perpendicular propagation the qk , q⊥ contributions
in the equations for pk , p⊥ naturally vanish and the CGL2 model is equivalent to the CGL model).
9.2. Mirror instability
A very interesting direction of propagation for this fluid model is the highly oblique limit, k⊥ ≫ kk , since the CGL2
fluid model contains the correct mirror instability threshold. The correct mirror threshold can be already seen in the
quantity A0 , where in contrast to the usual CGL model, the factor 1/6 disappeared in the last term ∼ a2p βk .
In the highly oblique limit, the fast mode (760) can be separated from the coupled 8-th degree polynomial (actually
4-th degree polynomial in ω 2 ) in the following way. Importantly, one can not prescribe a completely perpendicular
propagation kk = 0, and a highly oblique limit k⊥ ≫ kk , or kk → 0, has to be considered. The polynomial coefficients
can be approximated as

2
A6 = k⊥
(1 + ap β);



3
2
1 + ap βk − a2p βk .
(764)
A0 = kk6 βk3 k⊥
8
An alternative approximation is to use k⊥ → k in the above expressions. The coefficient A6 does not contain any kk
and is very large compared to A4 , A2 , A0 that all contain kk . The solutions will inevitably be one fast mode, and 3
very slow modes. In this specific case, the fast mode can be quickly separated from the 8th order polynomial in (752)
with a neat trick


ω 8 − A6 ω 6 + A4 ω 4 − A2 ω 2 + A0 = 0;



ω 2 − A6 − A6 ω 6 + A4 ω 4 − A2 ω 2 + A0 = 0.
(765)

The trick can be verified by multiplying both brackets term by term, dividing by −A6 , and observing that
(A4 , A2 , A0 )/A6 is negligible. The fast mode is always obtained correctly in this way (when the A6 is much larger than

98
all the other coefficients), however, the dispersion relation for the 3 slow modes is correct only in this specific case
when the system is non-dispersive, and all 3 slow modes have constant phase speeds. A proper limit and expansion
should be always checked.
p
Nevertheless, in the highly oblique limit, the fast mode ω = ±k⊥ 1 + ap βk is separated, and the rest of the dispersion
2
is of 6th order in ω and contains 3 “slow” modes. By canceling out thepk⊥
that is common in all the remaining
2
coefficients (or k ), an obvious substitution is offered that reads ω̄ = ω/(kk βk ), and that yields a dispersion equation
of 3rd order in ω̄ 2 in the form

Now, at exactly the mirror threshold ap βk = 1 + ap βk , the last term disappears and we have one solution ω̄ 2 = 0, and
two solutions
√
ω̄ 2 = (3 ± 5)/2,
(767)

that are both positive. Slightly below or beyond the mirror threshold, we can prescribe a2p βk = (1 + ap βk )(1 + ǫ), where
ǫ is a small parameter, meaning that for ǫ < 0, the system is slightly below the expected mirror threshold, i.e. stable.
For ǫ > 0, the system is slightly beyond the expected mirror threshold, i.e. unstable. The polynomial transforms to
ǫ

3
(ω̄ 2 )3 − (3 − )(ω̄ 2 )2 + (1 − ǫ)(ω̄ 2 ) + ǫ = 0.
(768)
2

8
It is possible to show that this polynomial has a discriminant12 △ > 0, implying the existence of 3 distinct real roots.
Now, when ǫ is small, the two solutions (767) will remain almost the same and change only slightly, importantly, the
solutions will remain positive. Solutions of a cubic polynomial (x − x1 )(x − x2 )(x − x3 ) = 0 form the last coefficient
in that polynomial, −x1 x2 x3 , here equal to 38 ǫ, and here x1 and x2 are positive. Therefore, ǫ < 0 (slightly below the
threshold) implies x3 > 0; and ǫ > 0 (slightly beyond the threshold) implies x3 < 0. The negative solution (in (ω̄ 2 ))
represents the mirror instability, which finishes the analytic proof that the (highly oblique) mirror threshold in CGL2
model is indeed a2p βk = 1 + ap βk . The CGL2 fluid model therefore contains the same mirror instability threshold as
is found in kinetic theory.
The conclusion can be double checked by numerically exploring solutions of (768) for several values of ǫ, and it
is indeed possible to conclude that for ǫ < 0 (slightly below the threshold) the signs of solutions are ω̄ 2 = +, +, +;
and that for ǫ > 0 (slightly beyond the mirror threshold), the signs of solutions are ω̄ 2 = +, +, −. The solution
with the minus sign represents the mirror instability. It is noted that the Landau fluid description allows for the
construction of a fluid model with quasi-static heat fluxes, that also correctly reproduces the “hard” mirror instability
threshold (Sulem & Passot 2012). Considering Landau fluid models, the mirror instability was numerically investigated
in detail for example by Passot & Sulem (2007); Passot et al. (2012); Sulem & Passot (2015). As a suggestion for
possible future work, it would be beneficial to numerically calculate “Hellinger’s” contours (see subsection 6.3) with
the prescribed maximum growth rate for the mirror instability. If one uses Landau fluid models with sufficiently precise
FLR corrections, the results should match the kinetic contours very precisely.

For strictly perpendicular propagation, the solution is (760) since the Hall term vanishes. The dispersion relation of
the Hall-CGL-FLR1 model was already quite large to write down, and we do not provide the final dispersion relation
for the Hall-CGL2-FLR1 model, instead we recommend to work with the full system of linearized equations and solve
it numerically or to use analytic software such as Maple.

9.4. “Static” closure - generalized isothermal closure
There exists even simpler fluid closure that recovers the correct mirror threshold, called “static” or “quasi-static”
closure (Constantinescu 2002; Chust & Belmont 2006; Passot et al. 2006). By using heat flux equations (736), (737)
and considering quasi-static regime with ∂qk /∂t = 0, ∂q⊥ /∂t = 0, u = 0 yields

where the FLR pressure tensor Π was neglected in the second equation. It is useful to define ∂k ≡ b̂·∇ which represents

where ap = T⊥ /Tk . Solution (773) is referred to as the “static” closure and it is for example equivalent to eq.
19, 20 of Passot et al. (2006), and eq. 2 of Constantinescu (2002). For isotropic mean temperatures ap = 1, eq.
(0)
(0)
(773) yields T⊥ = T⊥ = Tk and both parallel and perpendicular temperatures are isothermal. A similar result
(0)

is obtained for general ap with |B| = B0 , which yields T⊥ = T⊥ . The closure (773) can be therefore viewed as a
generalization of isothermal closure in the presence of temperature anisotropy and variations of magnetic field strength.
The closure is used directly in the momentum equation (732), and the time-dependent pressure equations (734), (735)
are disregarded. Therefore, even though the closure was derived by considering 4th-order moments, the resulting fluid
model is actually simpler than CGL2 and CGL models. As discussed for example by Passot et al. (2006), the closure
prescribes limitation for the minimal value of |B|/B0 > 1−1/ap that is required to prevent temperature singularity. Or
in other words, by separating |B| = B0 + B (1) the requirement reads B (1) > −1/ap , meaning that the fluctuating B (1)
can not be too negative. Mirror instability is often associated with nonlinear structures in the form of magnetic holes
and humps, and the requirement implies that the magnetic holes can not be too deep. To easily analyze dispersion
relations, it is useful to write the closure at the linear level, in the following form

pk = nTk ;

The result can be obtained by linearizing (773) or (772), and at the linear level ∂i |B| = ∂i Bz . The normalized closure
reads (tilde are dropped) pk = n and p⊥ = ap n + ap (1 − ap )Bz . Considering the simplest non-dispersive model (by
neglecting the Hall term and Π), the dispersion relation of this fluid model reads

In comparison with the dispersion relation (307) of the adiabatic CGL model, the “static” closure eliminates the
erroneous 1/6 factor in the A0 coefficient and yields the correct mirror threshold. The erroneous 1/6 factor in the
CGL model can be therefore interpreted as a result of inadequacy of adiabatic closures in the very slow-dynamics
context, such as the mirror instability. For completeness, solutions for parallel propagation (k⊥ = 0) are ω = ±vAk kk

and ω = ± 2k kk . For perpendicular propagation (kk = 0) the solution is ω = ± 1 + ap βk − a2p 2k k⊥ . Obviously,

100
somewhere beyond the mirror threshold, the perpendicular fast mode experiences unphysical instability, which can be
interpreted as a result of inadequacy of “static” (isothermal) closures in the fast-dynamics context.
To clearly demonstrate that variations of magnetic field in the “static” closure (774) are indeed crucial in recovering
(0)
(0)
the mirror instability, let’s neglect them and quickly consider strictly isothermal closure pk = nTk ; p⊥ = nT⊥ , which
yields the following dispersion relation

As can be seen from the A0 coefficient, this model does not recover the mirror instability. For parallel propagation the
solutions
q are the same as for the “static” closure, nevertheless, the perpendicular fast mode is now always stable with
β

ω = ± 1 + ap 2k k⊥ . As a double check, after prescribing ap = 1, the dispersion relation (776) is equal to (775), since
the Bz contributions in the “static” closure disappear. Also, we considered models with polytropic indices γk , γ⊥ in
Section 3.11, and the dispersion relation (776) is consistent with (287), after prescribing γk = 1, γ⊥ = 1.

10. BI-KAPPA FLUID MODEL (BIKAPPA)

10.1. Bi-kappa distribution function
Often in the solar wind and in the space plasma physics, distribution functions with elongated high-energy “suprathermal” tails are observed, that cannot be modeled with the bi-Maxwellian distribution. A slightly more general distribution function is the bi-kappa distribution, that contains one free parameter κ, see for example Summers & Thorne
(1992); Pierrard & Lazar (2010); Livadiotis & McComas (2013) and references therein. The κ parameter can be different in the parallel and transverse directions (see e.g. Basu (2009); dos Santos et al. (2015)). Here we consider only
one free κ parameter. The distribution has the following form

and Γ is the usual gamma function. In the limit κ → ∞, the generalized thermal speeds are the usual thermal speeds
and the distribution function is bi-Maxwellian, since

Why the generalized thermal speeds are defined this way will become clear from later calculations of moments, and the
choice of the power law index −(κ + 1), instead of perhaps more logical −κ, is attributed to a purely historical reasons.
Calculating 2nd-order (pressure) integrals with this distribution requires for convergence κ > 3/2, and this value is
also the minimum value for the generalized thermal speeds (778) to have real values. Sometimes, in the definition of
√
√
the isotropic kappa distribution, a value of Γ(3/2) = π/2 is used and π 3/2 = 2π π/2 = 2πΓ(3/2). Again, for the

brevity of calculations, it is useful to introduce αk = 1/(κθk2 ), α⊥ = 1/(κθ⊥
), and rewrite the bi-kappa distribution

For the critical value of a = 1/2, the integral 1/ 1 + x2 dx = arcsinh(x), and since limx→±∞ arcsinh(x) = ±∞, the

which explains the normalization factors. For an anisotropic bi-kappa distributions f (c2k , c2⊥ ), the integration is slightly
more complicated because in contrast to a bi-Maxwellian distribution, the integration cannot be fully separated to two

independent integrations over parallel and perpendicular velocity components, and have to be performed successively.
It is possible to use a cylindrical coordinate system and integrate

The last two calculations clarify the reasoning behind the definition of the bi-kappa generalized thermal speeds θk , θ⊥

⊥ = κθ⊥ is dictated by the requirement that for κ → ∞ the
generalized thermal speeds converge to the usual thermal speeds, and which also yields that in this limit the distribution
is bi-Maxwellian.
The bi-kappa distribution was specified with perhaps a bit obscure power law −(κ + 1) instead of more logical −κ,
which is attributed to purely historical reasons. If one wants to define an anisotropic power-law distribution, a first
guess would be

The convergence of the pressure integrals requires κ > 25 , which is also the limiting case for the thermal speeds to be real.
In the limit κ → ∞ the generalized thermal speeds converge to the usual thermal speeds and the distribution converges
to the bi-Maxwellian. To double-check that the distribution (807) is really correct, one can of course substitute

κ → κ+1, which fully recovers the original bi-kappa distribution (777), since κθ2 → (κ+1)(1− 2(κ+1)
m = κ(1− 2κ ) m .
From now on, lets continue calculations with the original bi-kappa distribution (777), that uses the −(κ + 1) power-law
index.
10.2. Bi-kappa fluid closure

fluxes are zero and easy to calculate, since both qk , q⊥ are anti-symmetric in ck , and by a direct calculation

where the 3 proportionality constants αkk , αk⊥ , α⊥⊥ have to be determined, once a specific distribution function
is prescribed. Such unspecified closure, can account for a very wide class of distribution functions. Also, a much
more complicated distribution functions can be modeled by considering multi-fluid models. For example, one could
consider plasma consisting of 3 different electron species, that would describe the core, halo and the tail/strahl parts
of the electron distribution function. Further information about the core, halo and strahl components of the electron
distribution function can be found for example in Vocks et al. (2005, 2008); Pierrard et al. (2011) and references
therein.
Here we consider closure (818), (819). Nevertheless, in the following calculations one can we keep the value of ακ
unspecified. Therefore, the results are actually valid for a much larger class of fluid models, and not just for a bi-kappa
distribution. Let’s completely neglect the non-gyrotropic Π and r ng in the heat flux equations (660) and (661). We

Obviously for ακ = 1 (i.e. for κ → ∞), the bi-Maxwellian heat flux equations are obtained. The model is now closed,
and it is accompanied by equations (731)-(735). The model is nonlinear and numerical simulations for a chosen (and
fixed) value of κ can be considered. Even though the κ coefficient is fixed, similarly to a bi-Maxwellian nonlinear
simulations, the temperature anisotropy is free to develop, and complicated plasma heating process can be studied (we
recommend to add the FLR pressure stress forces to the scalar pressure equations). We call the non-dispersive fluid
model that uses the above heat flux equations with abbreviation “BiKappa”. If the Hall term is considered in the
induction equation, “Hall-BiKappa” fluid model is obtained. Similarly, by considering FLR1 and FLR2 corrections to

106
the pressure tensor, yields “Hall-BiKappa-FLR1” and “Hall-BiKappa-FLR2” fluid models. The heat flux equations

Here we neglected perturbations re, since we will not consider Landau fluid models for bi-kappa distribution. For

vectors are not addressed here, since we would have to derive r ng for bi-kappa distribution.

and for ακ = 1 it is of course equivalent to the CGL2 dispersion relation (752). The oblique Alfvén mode is not
effected, and is identical to (751), implying that the long-wavelength threshold of the oblique firehose instability is
identical as well.

Note that in the last solution (837), the expression under the square root remains always positive, regardless how large
ακ is (i.e. when the κ-index approaches 5/2). For strictly perpendicular propagation (kk = 0), the fast mode is not
effected, and is equivalent to (760).
10.4. Mirror instability
By considering the highly oblique limit k⊥ ≫ kk , and by assuming that ακ is not enormously large (i.e. that κ is not
very close to 5/2) so that ακ kk can be neglected with respect to k⊥ , the polynomial coefficients can be approximated

and which for ακ = 1 is equivalent to the bi-Maxwellian polynomial (768). As previously, for small ǫ the solutions
(843) remain almost the same, and positive. Furthermore, since multiplying all 3 solutions together must yield − 83 α2κ ǫ,
it implies that below (ǫ < 0) the threshold the 3rd solution is positive, and beyond (ǫ > 0) the threshold the 3rd
solution is negative, which analytically proves that the (highly oblique) mirror instability threshold is a2p βk = 1 + ap βk ,
regardless of ακ . The long-wavelength limit or “hard” mirror threshold for the bi-kappa distribution is therefore the
same as for the bi-Maxwellian distribution.
CONCLUSION

We investigated solutions of the (non-dispersive) BiKappa fluid model. The calculations were done with closure (818)
for a general ακ coefficient, i.e. without using the specific value (819) for the bi-kappa distribution. The calculations
are therefore more general and valid for any distribution function that can be closed as (818). We conclude that all
3 long-wavelength “hard” thresholds - for the parallel and oblique firehose instability and the highly oblique mirror
instability - are not effected by the value of ακ .

where we kept the BiKappa dispersion relation (829)-(833) on the l.h.s., and the Hall term contributions on the r.h.s..
For the bi-Maxwellian value ακ = 1, the result is equivalent to the Hall-CGL2 dispersion relation (769). For strictly
parallel propagation, the solutions are the usual dispersive ion-cyclotron and whistler waves (that are not affected
by the ακ coefficient) and the non-dispersive solutions (835)-(837) of the BiKappa model. For strictly perpendicular
propagation, the Hall term naturally disappears and the fast mode solution is (760).

11. COLLISIONLESS DAMPING IN FLUID MODELS - LANDAU FLUID MODELS

In the previous sections, we have calculated the fluid hierarchy up to the 4th-order fluid moment r. We have seen
that unless we crossed some instability threshold, the dispersion relations yielded frequencies ω that were purely real,
and there was no collisionless damping present. Remarkably, collisionless damping, i.e. Landau damping, will be
absent even if we continue to develop the fluid hierarchy to higher-order moments. In fact, we will see in the next
section by considering parallel 1D propagation (where all the fluctuations are along B0 ), that fluid models closed by
a bi-Maxwellian fluid closure at higher-order moments than r, are always unstable. Such fluid models are physically
ill-posed. To go higher in the fluid hierarchy, one needs to incorporate Landau damping phenomenon into the fluid
framework, and consider Landau fluid closures.
Nevertheless, to capture the Landau damping, it is not necessary to go beyond the 4th-order moment and closures
performed at the 4th moment level describe the Landau damping with very good accuracy. Even though the entire
Part 2 of this text is dedicated to Landau fluid closures, it is beneficial to briefly show, why the Landau damping
was omitted in the previous calculations. Let’s consider the simplest example of 1D electrostatic propagation. The
collisionless Vlasov equation reads
∂f
∂f
q

(846)

Direct integration of the Vlasov equation (over vz ) for a general distribution function f , of course yields the usual
density equation, ∂n/∂t
+ ∂z (nuz ) = 0. The same result is obtained if one considers specific f0 , as for example 1D
p −α(v

z −uz )
e
, 1D kappa distribution, etc.. The last term of the Vlasov equation ∼ Ez vanishes by
Maxwellian f0 = n α

and one assumes that there is no large-scale electric field, so Ez

(847)

and transformation to Fourier space yields
−i(ω − kz vz )f (1) +

q (1) ∂f0

E
m z ∂vz

(848)

The equation (848) is actually not that much different from (846), the Vlasov equation is just fully linearized and
written in Fourier space. However, in kinetic calculations, the (848) is not directly integrated in this form. The crucial
technique that reveals the presence of Landau damping in the Vlasov equation is, that the equation (848) is first
divided by (ω − kz vz ), and an expression for f (1) is obtained. Only then the equation is integrated over the velocity
space, yielding

The integral contains a “singularity” in the denominator, and it is not obvious how to calculate this integral. Such
singularities are called wave-particle resonances, and can have a more general form ω − kz vz ± lΩ, where Ω is the
cyclotron frequency of the considered species, and l is an integer. The resonance for l = 0 is called the Landau
resonance, and the other resonances for l 6= 0 are called cyclotron resonances. It is the presence of these resonances
in integrals such as (849), that yields collisionless damping mechanisms, the Landau damping and the cyclotron
damping. In Part 2 of our guide, we will see that the integral actually cannot be “calculated”, i.e. the integral cannot
be expressed through elementary functions, even if f0 is simple Maxwellian. The integral is just expressed through the
famous plasma dispersion function Z(ζ), where ζ = ω/(|kz |vth ), since the plasma dispersion function was specifically
developed to describe this integral. Skipping many technical (but very important) details such as the definition of
Z(ζ), for Maxwellian f0 the density integral is simply expressed as
n(1) = −

(1)

q iEz 
1 + ζZ(ζ) .

(850)

One can define function R(ζ) = 1 + ζZ(ζ), that is called the plasma response function. Now for example considering

109

proton-electron plasma with Te = Tp at wavelengths that are much longer than the Debye length, yields the
following dispersion relation and numerical solution
ω
= ±1.457 − 0.627i.
(851)
R(ζp ) + R(ζe ) = 0; => ζp =
|kz |vthp

The negative imaginary part represents the Landau damping, and the effect comes from the Landau resonance in
the integral (849). Obviously, integrating the Vlasov equation directly in the form (846) or (1) neglects the waveparticle resonances in velocity space, which clarifies why traditional fluid models do not contain collisionless damping
mechanisms. It is the f (1) - the fluctuations/perturbations around f0 - where the wave-particle resonances are written
down explicitly, that yields the collisionless damping mechanisms in kinetic theory. To introduce collisionless damping
into fluid models, we have no other choice, and we have to calculate the hierarchy of moments again, this time by
integrating over the “kinetic” f (1) . We find it useful to introduce the following vocabulary:
• fluid moments = integrals over a general (unspecified) distribution function f , or over a specific f0 . Evolution
equations for fluid moments are obtained by direct integration of the Vlasov equation written in a form that
does not explicitly contain wave-particle resonances. The resulting expressions can be nonlinear or linear and
contain only fluid variables, i.e. expressions do not contain Z(ζ).
• kinetic moments = integrals over f (1) (perturbations f (1) = f − f0 , where a specific equilibrium f0 is assumed),
where the wave-particle resonances in velocity space are written down explicitly. The resulting expressions are
linear and contain Z(ζ), which is not a fluid variable.
Importantly, we want to keep the entire nonlinear fluid hierarchy discussed so far, including the nonlinear heat
flux equations. Therefore, considering bi-Maxwellian distribution f0 , instead of the “normal” closure, the 4th-order
moment is decomposed in the following form
rkk =

3p2k
ρ

+ rekk ;

rk⊥ =

pk p⊥
+ rek⊥ ;
ρ

r⊥⊥ =

2p2⊥
+ re⊥⊥ .
ρ

(852)

The first terms represent the “normal” closure, i.e. when an exact bi-Maxwellian f0 is prescribed. The tilde components
represent fluctuations/perturbations around f0 , and a good notation would also be δr. The decomposition (852) yields
the following form of the nonlinear heat flux equations

Similarly to decomposition (852), “kinetic” corrections with wave-particle resonances can also be considered for the
non-gyrotropic r ng , which is not addressed in this guide. Neglecting those contributions, the heat flux equations are
equivalent for example to eq. 14, 15 of Passot & Sulem (2007), and eq. 9, 10 of Passot et al. (2012).
In Part 2 of this guide, we will calculate the “kinetic moments” for rekk , rek⊥ , re⊥⊥ , by integrating over f (1) . In the 3D
electromagnetic geometry, we will use more sophisticated f (1) in the gyrotropic limit, which describes both Landau
damping and its magnetic analogue, the transit-time damping. The expressions of the entire “kinetic” hierarchy will
contain the Z(ζ), or actually the R(ζ), which is not a fluid variable. Nevertheless, we will see that by introducing the
concept of Padé approximation to R(ζ), that sometimes a rare possibility arises, when the “kinetic” moment re can
be expressed through lower-order “kinetic” moments. Such a closure, where the last retained kinetic moment (in this
case re) is expressed through lower-order moments, in a way that the kinetic Z(ζ) function is completely eliminated
and that the closure is valid for all ζ values, will be called a Landau fluid closure. For the impatient reader, we will
reveal, that one of the possibilities are going to be (written in Fourier space)

The first closure was obtained in the slab geometry by Hammett & Perkins (1990) and the remaining closures were
obtained in the 3D geometry by Snyder et al. (1997) (note that thermal speeds in those papers are defined without
the factor of 2). In Part 2 of our guide, we are going to map all the Landau fluid closures that can be constructed at
the 4th-moment level, and we will identify the most precise closures. A summary of these findings, can be found in
Hunana et al. (2018).

12. EVOLUTION EQUATION FOR N-TH ORDER FLUID MOMENT

Now we are proficient with calculating the fluid moments for general f , and before we start with kinetic calculations,
it is useful to derive the time-dependent evolution equation for a general n-th order fluid moment. Before going through
this part, we highly recommend to go through the parts of the paper where the pressure tensor and heat flux tensor
equations are obtained. Then the algebra and the notation used here will look hopefully logical and natural. We define
the n-th order fluid moment X (n) according to
(n)

Xij...n = m

and it is valid for n ≥ 2. Evaluation at m = 3 recovers the heat flux tensor equation (584) and evaluation at m = 2
recovers the pressure tensor equation (28). Note that X (4) = r, X (3) = q, X (2) = p, however, and very importantly,
according to our definition (858), X (1) = 0 and it is not equal to the velocity u, which is defined according to (4).
Additionally, X (0) = ρ. The momentum equation can still be recovered by evaluating (870) at n = 1, and by dividing
by ρ (where naturally the symmetric operator does not have any influence on a vector, and uSi = ui ). Similar equation
to our (870) was also obtained for example by Waelbroeck (2010), eq. 22, even though we did not verify if it is
consistent with ours since X (n) in that work is defined with v instead of our c.
We want to always decompose the tensor X (n) to its gyrotropic and nongyrotropic part, and to have a space to
write the “g” and “ng”, lets move the index (n) down, so that
g
ng
X(n) = X(n)
+ X(n)
.

(874)

By generalizing the results we have seen for the gyrotropic pg , q g , r g , the same result is obtained for the n-th moment,
and at low frequencies the gyrotropic part must satisfy
h
iS
g
b̂ × X(n)

Ideally, an “inversion procedure” should be found for the l.h.s., so that an equation for X(n)
can be found, and then by
expanding the r.h.s. (for example at the leading order by considering only gyrotropic X g ), a fully nonlinear expressions
ng
for X(n)
can be obtained. Nevertheless, we have seen that the inversion procedure was already quite complicated for

the matrix (b̂ × Π)S , see eq. (395). For a tensor of 3rd-rank, such as the (b̂ × q ng )S , the full inversion procedure
is actually not addressed in this guide and an advanced reader is referred to eq. 43 of Ramos (2005). The inversion
k
procedure was obtained only for a part of the q ng , that can be decomposed to the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors S⊥ ,
⊥
S⊥
, which is done in detail in the Appendix D. For the rest of the q ng that consists of heat flux tensor σ, the inversion
procedure cannot be avoided. Additionally, we have seen that for 4th-order moment r ng , the eq. (877) does not seem
to yield anything useful even at the linear level, and a different procedure was used, where the specific bi-Maxwellian
distribution was expanded in Hermite polynomials. Therefore, for higher-order moments, the eq. (877) is immensely
complicated.

It is useful to briefly consider, how many scalar gyrotropic moments has an n-th order tensor X(n) . The scalar
gyrotropic moments can be constructed only from combinations of ck and c2⊥ . It is beneficial to write down the

Obviously, the number of gyrotropic moments for tensor X(n) is equal to 1 + int[n/2]. The function “int” means
integer part. In mathematics, the integer function is often abbreviated with square brackets, as 1 + [n/2]. However,
this notation might be possibly confusing (we used square brackets in many other places), and we prefer to write
explicitly “int”. Another possibility would be to use the “floor” function.

12.1. Hierarchy of moments in 1D geometry (electrostatic)
Let’s see if we can use the n-th order moment equation (873) for something useful, since the equation is immensely
complicated. Let’s consider the special case of strictly parallel propagation along B0 (in the z-direction), where all the
moments (including the velocity) are along B0 , i.e. let’s consider the electrostatic case. Let’s change the index of a
moment from (n) to (l), so that the index is not confused with the number density. Let’s stop writing the k subscript
on all the variables
starting from the pressure, so pk , qk , rkk are simply p, q, r and the l-th order parallel moment is
R
just X (l) ≡ m clk f dv. We keep the z-subscript for uz to remind us we are writing 1D equations. In 1D geometry, the
nonlinear evolution equation (873) simplifies to


X + ∂z X (l+1) + uz X (l) + l(∂z uz )X (l) − (∂z p)X (l−1) = 0;

l ≥ 2.

(878)

If one wants to be more general, instead of propagation along B0 , it is possible to consider propagation along magnetic
field line b̂, and write the same equation with uk and ∂k . The equation is accompanied by the density and momentum

When closing the system, one has to be careful how to deal with l=even quantities, since we want to separate the
“deviations”, similarly as we did for r = 3p2 /ρ + re. For a Maxwellian f0 and l ≥ 4 and even, we therefore write

l = even :

The equations are written in physical units, and these results will be useful in Part 2, where we will calculate Landau
fluid closures for deviations of various moments.
12.2. Impossibility to go beyond CGL2 without Landau fluid closures

2
with e
k = kVA /Ωp , ω
e = ω/Ωp and β = vth
/VA2 in almost all dispersion relations, let’s rewrite the fluid hierarchy to
normalized units, so that everything feels more familiar. The X (5) is normalized with p0 VA3 , the X (6) with p0 VA4 , and
X (n) with p0 VAn−2 . By dropping the normalization tilde as usual (but obviously not for even moments such as re, that
should be perhaps called δr), the equations in Fourier space read
−ωρ + kuz = 0;

fluid hierarchy. With the next example we demonstrate that this does not happen. Let us consider fluctuations in re,

Importantly, the last two modes are imaginary, and one is unstable. Therefore, such a fluid model does not make any
physical sense. Why did this happen ? For example, expressing everything through pressure fluctuations, and putting
the re fluctuations on the r.h.s yields

DOUBLE-CHECK

Let’s double check our results, to verify that we calculated everything correctly. As stated previously, a closure
should be performed only at the last retained fluid moment, and this is especially true when nonlinear numerical
simulations are performed.13 The CGL and CGL2 systems were already discussed at great length. Let’s check the
CGL3 dispersion relation, and let’s work directly in physical units. The system of equations that we have in mind
reads

∂
r + ∂z X (5) + 5r0 (∂z uz ) = 0,
∂t

(937)

and the closure is performed by setting X (5) = 0. Importantly, the 4th-order moment r is kept undetermined, and
it is not separated to its “core” and re, nor any specific form of a distribution function is prescribed yet (other than
(l)
the mean values of odd moments X0 = 0). Calculating dispersion relation of this system (a matrix multiplied by
vector (ρ, uz , p, q, r) ) yields result ω 4 − 5k 4 r0 /ρ0 = 0, which for r0 = 3p20 /ρ0 recovers the CGL3 dispersion relation.
Our calculations were therefore done right. Similarly, double checking the CGL4 dispersion, the system (937) is
supplemented with equation (890), and a closure is performed with X (6) = 15p3 /ρ. Again, the r is left untouched,
and dispersion relation of this system recovers the CGL4 result. Checking the CGL5 dispersion relation, the system
is supplemented with (891), and a closure X (7) = 0. Again, the X (6) is kept untouched and generally undetermined.

(6)
Calculating the dispersion relation yields ω 6 − 7k 6 X0 /ρ0 = 0, and prescribing Maxwellian X0 = 15p30 /ρ20 recovers
(8)

the CGL5 result. Going higher in the hierarchy, and using closure X
= 105p /ρ recovers the CGL6 results.
And finally, keeping all the variables up to X (8) undetermined and using closure X (9) = 0 yields dispersion relation
(8)
(8)
ω 8 − 9k 8 X0 /ρ0 = 0, which for Maxwellian X0 = 105p40 /ρ30 recovers the CGL7 result.
Or in general, without yet performing a closure, and going higher and higher in the hierarchy step by step, a

13 An alternative approach that would describe the Landau damping very precisely, is to keep the fully nonlinear CGL2 equations, and
supplement them with a hierarchy of time-dependent linear equations for higher-order moments, closed with an appropriate Landau fluid
closure.

Therefore, the last physically meaningful fluid model (without considering Landau fluid closures) is the CGL2 model,
and the last closure is the “normal” closure, r = 3p2 /ρ. To go higher in the fluid hierarchy, we necessarily need to
make connection to kinetic theory, and consider Landau fluid closures. These closures are described in Part 2 of our
guide, and for direct comparison with the simplest Landau fluid dispersion relations, see Part 2, Section 3.12 “Parallel
ion-acoustic (sound) mode, cold electrons”.

13. CONCLUSIONS

We offer a brief summary of the major results discussed throughout the text.
• Collisionless plasma is completely described by the kinetic Vlasov equation. By directly integrating the Vlasov
equation over velocity space, yields evolution equations for an infinite hierarchy of fluid moments. In addition
to the usual density and momentum equations, it is possible to derive an evolution equation for a general n-th
order fluid moment (n ≥ 2), see eq. (873). Then, evolution equations for the pressure tensor and heat flux tensor
can be obtained by simply evaluating (873) at n = 2 and n = 3.
• Even though the fluid hierarchy is infinite, the reformulation of the kinetic description to a fluid formalism is not
necessarily complete, since the usual calculations neglect wave-particle resonances in velocity space. These waveparticle resonances that are implicitly present in the Vlasov equation are responsible for collisionless damping
mechanisms, such as Landau damping, transit-time damping and cyclotron damping.
• The presence (or absence) of collisionless damping mechanisms in a fluid hierarchy is determined by the type of
closure selected to truncate that fluid hierarchy. We differentiate between two classes of closures: 1) “Classical”
(non-Landau fluid) closures, that neglect wave-particle resonances, and 2) Landau fluid closures, that account
for Landau wave-particle resonances and associated Landau damping & transit-time damping, addressed in Part
2.
• There are currently no known closures that account for cyclotron wave-particle resonances and associated cyclotron damping. Nevertheless, there is a priori no reason why such fluid closures can not be found in the future,
at least for the simplified case of electromagnetic propagation along the magnetic field (slab geometry).
• Considering “classical” closures, the hierarchy of fluid moments therefore does not contain collisionless damping
mechanisms, regardless of the order to which the hierarchy is developed. Or in another words, collisionless
damping is beyond all-orders in the classical hierarchy of fluid moments.
• In fact, it is impossible to go beyond the 4th-order moment with classical bi-Maxwellian fluid closures X (n) =
(n)
f(n) , where X (n) represents bi-Maxwellian value of X (n) and its perturbation X
f(n) = 0, since all the
X0 + X
0
fluid models contain higher-order modes that are unstable. This is perhaps the most surprising result discussed
in Part 1. For a detailed proof, see section 12.2, where 1D geometry is considered and a bi-Maxwellian closure
is used at the n-th order fluid moment, which yields dispersion relation (953). The same dispersion relation will
be valid in 3D geometry for the propagation along the magnetic field, where additional de-coupled modes will
be present as well. For n > 4, all the fluid models contain unphysical instabilities. The same result is expected
for other distribution functions.

• The classical bi-Maxwellian closure at the 4th-order moment reads rkk = 3 ρk ; rk⊥ = kρ ⊥ ; r⊥⊥ = 2 ρ⊥ (or
equivalently re = 0), and is called the “normal” closure. Therefore, the “normal” closure is the last classical fluid
f(n) = 0) and beyond the 4th-order moment, Landau fluid closures (X
f(n) 6= 0) are required.

• From a collisionless (or weakly collisional) perspective, the long-wavelength low-frequency limit of a distribution
function is not necessarily an isotropic Maxwellian, but a general distribution function that is gyrotropic, i.e.
isotropic only in its perpendicular velocity components. Fluid moments are therefore typically decomposed into
their gyrotropic and non-gyrotropic parts. For example the pressure tensor p = pg + Π, the heat flux tensor
q = q g + q ng , the 4th-order moment r = r g + r ng . The non-gyrotropic parts are also referred to as the Finite
Larmor Radius (FLR) corrections, since they represent deviations from gyrotropy at small spatial scales, when
the Larmor radius (gyroradius) is not infinitely small.
• A general n-th order fluid moment contains 1 + int[n/2] scalar gyrotropic moments, where the function “int”
means integer part.

• The pressure tensor is 2nd-order fluid moment and contains two gyrotropic moments, pk and p⊥ . Therefore,
any fluid description of collisionless (or weakly collisional) plasmas, requires two separate evolution equations
for pk and p⊥ . Importantly, from a linear perspective the evolution equations remain different even when the
(0)

(0)

distribution function is isotropic, i.e. even when the mean pressure values are equal (pk = p⊥ ), since pressure
fluctuations in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field remain anisotropic. We often

use proton pressure (temperature) anisotropy coefficient ap = T⊥ /Tk = p⊥ /pk .

122
• The simplest fluid model that describes collisionless plasma in an adiabatic regime is the CGL description (model)
- named after Chew-Goldberger-Law (Chew et al. 1956). The model is non-dispersive and obtained by a closure
with zero heat flux. The CGL description should be viewed as collisionless magnetohydrodynamics (collisionless
MHD), since the usual MHD description with isotropic scalar pressure is highly-collisional implicitly.
• The CGL pressure tensor is decomposed with respect to the direction of the local magnetic field lines according
to pg = pk b̂b̂ + p⊥ (I − b̂b̂). It is possible to switch to the reference frame of the magnetic field lines, where
the pressure tensor is a diagonal matrix. However, it should not be forgotten that in a such a reference frame,
imposing external (mean) magnetic field is not straightforward. For nonlinear numerical simulations of turbulence
and plasma heating, the laboratory reference frame is strongly recommended.
• The two pressure equations of the CGL model can be interpreted as conservation laws for the first and second
adiabatic invariants, see Section 2.5. The first adiabatic invariant is a conservation of the magnetic moment
of a particle that is periodically gyrating around a mean magnetic field. The second adiabatic invariant is a
conservation of the average parallel momentum of a particle that is completely trapped and periodically bouncing
inside of a magnetic bottle.
• Without performing (yet) any kind of closure and leaving the heat flux tensor q and FLR pressure tensor Π
unspecified, it is possible to derive rigorously exact evolution equations for pk and p⊥ , see eq. (91)-(92).
• Rewriting the pressure equations to an alternative form, eq. (99)-(100), shows that the adiabatic invariants in
the CGL model are broken by the inclusion of the Hall-term in the induction equation, gyrotropic heat flux,
non-gyrotropic FLR corrections to the pressure and heat flux, as well as by coupling of various species together.
All of these contributions therefore yield very complicated anisotropic plasma heating processes, that can be
studied only by nonlinear numerical simulations.
• The anisotropic plasma heating does not simplify much even in the case of periodic boundary conditions (i.e.
when the system can be viewed as completely isolated) and when averaging over the entire spatial volume is
performed and expressed as a conservation of total energy, see eq. (112)-(115). Only when the anisotropic heating
is neglected, i.e. when only total plasma heating studied, the conservation of energy significantly simplify, see
eq. (108)-(110).
• By using the concept of polytropic indices, the pressure equations in the ideal CGL model can be interpreted
as having γk = 3 and γ⊥ = 2. Consequently, the CGL dispersion relation is in general not equal to the MHD
dispersion relation, even when ap = 1. The exception is the Alfvén mode, which for ap = 1 propagates with the
same phase speed ω/k = VA cos θ in both CGL and MHD models, for all the propagation directions θ.
• Polytropic indices can be further related to the number of degrees of freedom i through γ = (i + 2)/i, which
for the CGL model yields ik = 1 and i⊥ = 2. The CGL pressure equations can be therefore viewed as being
composed of strongly coupled 1D and 2D dynamics, whereas the dynamics in the MHD model with γ = 5/3 and
i = 3 can be viewed as isotropicaly 3-dimensional.

• In the CGL model, the Alfvén mode propagates with the phase speed ω/k = VA cos θ 1 + 2k (ap − 1), which
matches the (collisionless) kinetic theory in the long-wavelength limit. Consequently, for ap = 1, the Alfvén
mode in the MHD model matches the kinetic theory as well. The CGL result is very useful when numerically
solving kinetic dispersion relations (for example with the WHAMP solver), since the Alfvén mode can be easily
identified at long-wavelengths.
• In contrast to MHD where the ordering of phase speeds is always vs ≤ vA ≤ vf (slow, Alfvén, fast), in collisionless
plasmas the oblique slow mode can become faster than the oblique Alfvén mode. In general, oblique slow and fast
modes in the CGL model do not necessarily match the kinetic theory in the long-wavelength limit. Nevertheless,
the effect when vs > vA is present in the CGL model and exists even for ap = 1, see Section 3.6. The effect is
very important for the parallel firehose instability.
◦
• Considering strictly perpendicular
p propagation (θ = 90 or kk = 0), the fast mode in the CGL model propagates
with the phase speed ω/k = VA 1 + ap βk , which matches the kinetic theory in the long-wavelength limit. The

123
(0)

(ω/k)2 = VA2 + 35 pρ0 . The factor of 2 in the CGL result comes from γ⊥ = 2, which shows that the adiabatic
assumption of the CGL model is appropriate for the perpendicular fast mode.
• Contributions of the Hall term completely disappear for strictly perpendicular propagation.
• It is more difficult to analytically show where the adiabatic CGL value γk = 3 is appropriate, since for example
the parallel propagating ion-acoustic (sound) mode is strongly Landau damped in kinetic theory (unless electrons
are hot), which also modifies its real frequency. The ion-acoustic mode in the CGL model therefore does not
match kinetic theory. One needs to consider Landau fluid models with proton and electron species, which is
addressed in Part 2.
• Nevertheless, when electrons are hot (Te ≫ Ti ) and the ion-acoustic mode is Landau damped
only weakly, the
p
real phase speed obtained from kinetic theory in the long-wavelength limit reads ω/k = (Te + 3Ti )/mi . Thus,
in this example the kinetic theory is matched by a fluid model where protons are described adiabatically (with
the CGL value γk = 3), while electrons are isothermal (with γk = 1). Also, a good example for γk = 3 is the real
(0)

2
frequency of the Langmuir mode, ω 2 = ωpe
+ 3(Tke /me )k 2 , which is addressed in Part 2.

• For anisotropic temperatures (ap 6= 1), some modes can become unstable. A threshold of an instability that is
obtained in the long-wavelength (non-dispersive) limit is called “hard” threshold. The CGL model contains 3
instabilities, the oblique firehose instability, the parallel firehose instability and the mirror instability. The mirror
instability is not described correctly.
• The oblique firehose instability is an instability of the oblique Alfvén mode. Since the Alfvén mode is described
β
correctly by the CGL model, its instability threshold 1 + 2k (ap − 1) < 0 matches the kinetic theory. The
instability requires ap < 1 and (in the long-wavelength limit) βk > 2. Since the CGL model is non-dispersive,
here the instability growth rate only has a simple cos θ dependence. Once dispersive effects are considered, the
instability reaches maximum growth rate at some wavenumber and angle θ that is oblique, see Figure 10.
• The parallel firehose instability is an instability of the whistler mode, which can be shown by considering the HallCGL model. However, considering usual (non-causal) analytic solutions (339)-(342), one arrives at a contradiction
that for ωr > 0 the whistler mode is unstable, and that for ωr < 0 the whistler mode is stable. The contradiction
arises, because at the range of wavenumbers where the firehose instability exists, the ion-cyclotron and whistler
modes are completely degenerate and distinguishing between them looses sense. The problem is resolved by
introducing a small (∼ ǫ) causal dissipation into the momentum equations, which is later removed by the limit
limǫ→0+ . The procedure yields causal dispersion relations (350)-(353), where the whistler mode is firehose
unstable for both positive and negative ωr , and the ion-cyclotron mode is stable.
• The parallel firehose instability occurs for quasi-parallel (small θ) propagation directions, with the maximum
growth rate at θ = 0◦ , see Figure 10. In the non-dispersive CGL model it corresponds to the instability of the
slow mode. Its threshold obtained for θ = 0◦ is equivalent to the oblique firehose instability (since vs = vA ), and
matches the kinetic theory. At first it might sound surprising that the slow mode connects to the whistler mode
once dispersive effects are considered. However, considering θ = 0◦ , βk > 2, ap < 1 yields that the fast mode
is the ion-acoustic (sound) mode and vs = vA , see Figure 1. After dispersive effects are introduced, which split
the Alfvén and slow mode to the ion-cyclotron and whistler mode, it is clarified that the instability is associated
with the whistler mode. For quasi-parallel propagation directions the situation is more obvious, since vs > vA
(see Figure 1), and the slow mode clearly becomes the whistler mode.
• In the non-dispersive CGL model, all 3 instabilities are non-propagating, i.e. purely growing with zero real
frequency. Once dispersive effects are introduced, the parallel firehose instability becomes propagating.
• The mirror instability requires ap > 1 and usually develops for highly-oblique propagation angles. In the CGL
model it corresponds to the instability of the slow mode. Its threshold obtained in the highly-oblique (but not
completely perpendicular) limit reads 1 + ap βk − 61 a2p βk < 0, and with respect to kinetic theory the 1/6 factor is
erroneous. The erroneous 1/6 factor shows that the adiabatic CGL closure is not appropriate for the very-slow
dynamics of the mirror instability.

124
• The simplest fluid closure that recovers the correct threshold of the mirror instability is the “static” closure,
see Section 9.4. This closure is derived from the “normal” closure in a simplified quasi-static approximation,
and represents a generalization of the isothermal closure (in presence of temperature anisotropy and variations
of magnetic field strength). The “static” closure is very useful since it clarifies, that the highly-oblique veryslow dynamics of the slow mode (and of the associated mirror instability), is better described by a generalized
isothermal closure than the adiabatic CGL closure.
• However, the “static” closure modifies the dynamics of the perpendicular fast mode, that now does not match the
kinetic theory. Additionally, the fast mode now experiences an uphysical instability, even though the instability
is beyond the mirror threshold, and should perhaps not play a role in numerical simulations. The erroneous
result shows that the generalized isothermal closure is not appropriate for the relatively fast dynamics of the
perpendicular fast mode, where the adiabatic CGL closure is appropriate.
• Heuristically, the correct mirror threshold can be also obtained by keeping the CGL value γ⊥ = 2 and modifying
the parallel polytropic index to γk = 1/2. Such a closure does not alter the dynamics of the perpendicular fast
mode, since the phase speed depends only on γ⊥ (and not on γk ). Thresholds of parallel and oblique firehose
instability are not altered either. Nevertheless, the γk = 1/2 is even below the isothermal value γk = 1, the
closure is heuristic, and it is mentioned only as a curiosity.
• Obviously, to correctly capture both the slow dynamics of the highly-oblique mirror instability, as well as the fast
dynamics of the perpendicular fast mode, neither adiabatic nor (generalized) isothermal closures are sufficient.
Considering classical (rigorously derived) closures, one has no other choice but to keep the correct adiabatic
CGL values γk = 3, γ⊥ = 2 unaltered, and instead, break the (long-wavelength) adiabaticity by going higher
in the fluid hierarchy. One needs to consider fluid models with evolution equations for the heat flux tensor q,
that has two gyrotropic components, qk and q⊥ . The system is closed at the 4th-order moment r, that have
3 gyrotropic components, rkk ; rk⊥ ; r⊥⊥ . To perform a closure, a specific distribution function (or a class of
distribution functions) has to be assumed.
• Considering a bi-Maxwellian distribution function, the closure re = 0 is known as the “normal” closure (see
above). We call this non-dispersive bi-Maxwellian fluid model the “2nd-order CGL”, abbreviated as CGL2. The
abbreviation CGL2 seems beneficial, since the name CGL is associated with collisionless magnetohydrodynamics,
now just taken to one higher order. Additionally, by showing that all classical bi-Maxwellian models beyond
CGL2 do not make physical sense, fluid models can be easily classified as based on CGL or CGL2 descriptions.
For direct comparison of the two systems, see dispersion relations of the CGL model (307) and the CGL2 model
(752). The Hall term introduces simplest dispersive effects, see dispersion relations of the Hall-CGL model (385),
and the Hall-CGL2 model (769).
• By comparing the dispersion relations, it is obvious that the gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations in the CGL2 model
(0)
(0)
modify the general dynamics (the mean heat flux values are zero qk = q⊥ = 0). One of the exceptions is the
perpendicular fast mode, which is not altered by the gyrotropic heat fluxes, and therefore described correctly.
Other exceptions are the oblique Alfvén mode (the oblique firehose instability), and once dispersive effects are
introduced also the parallel propagating ion-cyclotron and whistler modes (the parallel firehose instability).
• Two additional evolution equations typically create two additional modes. For example, for the case of highlyoblique CGL2 propagation, one obtains the Alfvén mode, the fast mode, and 3 “slow” modes. One of these
slow modes is responsible for the mirror instability, and is sometimes called the mirror mode. The CGL2 mirror
threshold matches the kinetic theory. The CGL2 model is therefore the simplest classical model that correctly
captures (in the long-wavelength limit) both the mirror instability threshold, as well as the perpendicular fast
mode. Nevertheless, only the “hard” mirror threshold is correctly recovered, and capturing the (long-wavelength)
mirror instability growth rate requires Landau damping.
• One can construct closures for other distribution functions than bi-Maxwellians. For example, one can consider the bi-Kappa distribution function (777) with a free parameter κ > 3/2. The closure then reads rkk =
p2

p p

p2

3ακ ρk ; rk⊥ = ακ kρ ⊥ ; r⊥⊥ = 2ακ ρ⊥ , where the coefficient ακ = (κ − 32 )/(κ − 25 ). The closure is restricted to
κ > 25 , which can be seen from the ακ coefficient, and the same requirement is necessary for the convergence of
the velocity integrals. We call this closure and resulting fluid model simply as “biKappa”.

125
• If a closure for the bi-Kappa distribution is performed at a higher nth-order moment (which is presumably not
possible with classical closures since it is expected that for n > 4 all models contain unphysical instabilities), the
closure will be restricted to κ > (n + 1)/2, which increases with n. The requirement for the minimum κ value
is there, since the power-law in the bi-Kappa distribution is assumed all the way till infinite velocities, and the
requirement is necessary for the convergence of the velocity integrals. Therefore, by going higher and higher in
the bi-Kappa fluid hierarchy, the minimum value of κ increases, and in the limit κ → ∞ the required distribution
function converges towards bi-Maxwellian.
• The dispersion relation for the biKappa model is given by (829). A general ακ coefficient is used, so the dispersion
relation is valid for a much larger class of distribution functions that can be closed with an analogous closure with
just one ακ coefficient. The dispersion relation shows that the general dynamics is of course altered by the value
of the ακ coefficient. Nevertheless, few exceptions are: the oblique Alfvén mode (oblique firehose threshold), the
perpendicular fast mode, the parallel firehose threshold, and the mirror threshold. When dispersive effects are
considered, and figures similar to Figure 10 created, the growth rates for oblique propagation will of course be
affected by the ακ value. The Hall-biKappa dispersion relation is given by (845).
• The non-gyrotropic (FLR) corrections Π to the pressure tensor were studied in Section 5. The tensor Π is
described by the pressure tensor equation implicitly. To prevent introducing several new independent fluid
variables for components of the tensor Π, each with its own evolution equation, expansion on temporal and
spatial scales is required. Correct evaluation of the FLR tensor with respect to magnetic field lines is quite
cumbersome, and at the leading order (in temporal and spatial scales) one obtains (427)-(429), or equivalently
(435)-(437). The FLR tensor Π is therefore often evaluated in the linear approximation, which is appropriate
when the magnetic field lines are not too distorted.
• Even though the FLR pressure tensor Π has a zero trace, its contributions should not be called as “off-diagonal”,
since the diagonal components are non-zero. In the collisionless case considered here with the mean field in the
z-direction, only Πzz = 0, and Πxx = −Πyy 6= 0. In the collisional case (which was not considered) also Πzz 6= 0.
• For the purpose of comparing various contributions, we differentiate between FLR1, FLR2 and FLR3 corrections,
even though the classification can be a bit blurry and there are various possibilities. Perhaps the best definition
that we used later is as follows. The classical FLR1 tensor Π contains only velocity gradients, see (458).
The FLR2 tensor also contains ∂Π/∂t and the Hall-term from the induction equation, see (492). It can also
k
contain gyrotropic heat flux contributions, see (523). The FLR3 contains non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors S⊥ ,
⊥
S⊥
, described in Section 5.8, with the detailed algebra presented in Appendix D. It can also contain the nongyrotropic heat flux tensor σ, which we neglected. For complete clarity in analyzing the dispersion relations, the
entire Hall-CGL-FLR3 model (linearized in the x-z plane, normalized and Fourier transformed) is written down
in Section 5.9, see eq. (543)-(546).
• Considering the strictly perpendicular fast mode, kinetic theory yields the leading order FLR corrections (in the
5 2 2
2
long-wavelength limit) to the phase speed in the following form (ω/k)2 = VA2 (1 − 81 k 2 ρ2i ) + vth⊥
(1 − 16
k ρi ). The
kinetic result is reproduced by the CGL-FLR3 model (the Hall contributions are zero). Importantly, both the
first and second order non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors have to be retained.
• If the second order non-gyrotropic heat flux contributions are neglected in the FLR3 model, yields solution for
the perpendicular fast mode (542). In such a model, the correction to the Alfvén speed is captured correctly,
1 2 2
5 2 2
however, the correction to the thermal speed is + 16
k ρi instead of − 16
k ρi , i.e., the correction has a wrong
sign. This is surprising, since the solution of the FLR2 model, eq. (503), has a correction to the thermal speed
1 2 2
k ρi , i.e. at least the sign is correct. Finally, the FLR1 model yields solution (502), and does not capture
− 16
any correction to the Alfvén speed, additionally, the correction to the thermal speed has a wrong sign as well.
• We used the Hall-CGL-FLR3 model to investigate the parallel and oblique firehose instability, and compare it
with results of the FLR2 and FLR1 models, see Figures 7-11. It is shown that the growth rates of the parallel
and oblique firehose instability are strongly enhanced by the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors of the FLR3 model,
see Figure 10 (see the scales of colorbars).
• In general, when the maximum growth rates are sufficiently large (let’s say ωi /Ω ∼ 0.1) and not tiny (such as
0.001), the FLR3 model reproduces the kinetic results with unexpectedly good accuracy. See for example bottom

126
panels of Figure 10. Not only is the value of the maximum growth rate for the oblique firehose instability (red
lines) approximately the same in the FLR3 model and kinetic theory, the maximum growth rate is also reached
approximately for the same angle of propagation and the same wavenumber.
• The oblique firehose instability can be (in general) reproduced with better accuracy than the parallel firehose
instability. Nevertheless, for very high βk values, the parallel firehose instability is reproduced very accurately,
see Figure 9.
• Importantly, we show that the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors in the FLR3 model, partially reproduce the large
“bump” in the imaginary phase speed (growth rate normalized to the wavenumber), when the plasma is close
to the long wavelength limit “hard” firehose threshold, see Figure 7. The result clearly shows, that similarly to
kinetic theory, fluid models can develop firehose instability at small spatial scales, even when they are stable in
the long-wavelength limit. Or in other words, fluid models can become unstable even before the “hard” firehose
threshold is reached. This unexpected result is perhaps the second most surprising result discussed in Part 1.

APPENDIX
A. FOURIER TRANSFORMATIONS

If we have an equation in Real space, we decompose each quantity as a superposition of waves according to
Z ∞ Z ∞
1
f (x, t) =
fˆ(k, ω)eik·x−iωt d3 kdω.
(2π)4 −∞ −∞

(A1)

Most of plasma physics books and kinetic papers use eik·x−iωt in the definition (A1). Decomposing the frequency to
real and imaginary part ω = ωr + iωi , so e−iωt = e−iωr t e+ωi t , implies that a wave with ωi > 0 grows (i.e. has a
positive growth rate) and a wave with ωi < 0 is damped. Of course, an alternative definition of (A1) with e−ik·x+iωt
is allowed, one just has to remember that a wave with ωi > 0 is damped and a wave with ωi < 0 grows. However, in
part 2 of the text, we will calculate the Landau damping and we will see that following all the correct minus signs in
the Landau integral can be very confusing. We therefore recommend to use the first decomposition, where waves with
ωi < 0 are damped. This choice yields that Fourier transformations in the x-z plane (with B0 in the z-direction) are
performed according to a shortcut
∂
↔ −iω;
∂t

∂z ↔ ikk ;

∂x ↔ ik⊥ .

(A2)

The transformation (A1) is technically the inverse/backward Fourier transform F −1 fˆ(k, ω). The forward Fourier
transform reads
Z ∞ Z ∞
f (k, ω) =
fˆ(x, t)e−ik·x+iωt d3 xdt.
(A3)
−∞

−∞

The location of normalization constants 1/(2π) is an ad-hoc choice, one just needs to be consistent in using them,
especially when calculating convolutions.
B. GENERALIZED VECTOR (CROSS) PRODUCT

In the collisionless fluid hierarchy one encounters a vector product between vectors and tensors, as for example in
the pressure tensor equation (26). It is useful to clarify the definition of this generalized vector product. Consider
matrix A, which is written as a tensor product between vectors a, b, so A = a ⊗ b = ab, where as everywhere in
this text, we omit writing the tensor product ⊗. Or in the index notation Aij = ai bj . Now consider vector c, and
how can one define a generalized vector product c × A, by using the usual vector product between two vectors. The
natural definition is c × A = c × (ab) ≡ (c × a)b, or in the index notation (c × A)ij = ǫikl ck al bj = ǫikl ck Alj . Now
let’s consider how to define the much more confusing A × c. The natural definition is A × c = (ab) × c ≡ a(b × c),
and in the index notation (A × c)ij = ai ǫjkl bk cl = ǫjkl Aik cl . Now it is straightforward to show that
A × c = −(c × AT )T .

(B4)

Generalizing the vector product to higher order tensors is easy and in the fluid hierarchy we always encounter a vector
b̂, and tensors p, q, r, let’s therefore write


p × b̂ ij = ǫjrs pir b̂s ;
b̂ × p ij = ǫirs b̂r psj ;


(B5)
q × b̂ ijk = ǫkrs qijr b̂s ;
b̂ × q ijk = ǫirs b̂r qsjk ;


b̂ × r ijkl = ǫirs b̂r rsjkl ; r × b̂ ijkl = ǫlrs rijkr b̂s .
The vector product is very useful for decomposing quantities to the directions parallel and perpendicular with respect
to b̂. For example, the usual decomposition of the velocity u reads
u = (u · b̂)b̂ + u · (I − b̂b̂) .
| {z } |
{z
}

(B6)

u = (u · b̂)b̂ − b̂ × (b̂ × u),

(B7)

uk

u⊥

Nevertheless, it is possible to directly obtain u⊥ , by applying b̂× twice on u, so that

or u⊥ = b̂ × u × b̂. Similar decompositions can be made for tensors. For example, a general matrix Π can be
decomposed according to
Π = (Π · b̂)b̂ + Π · (I − b̂b̂),
(B8)

128
where the perpendicular component can be written as Π·(I − b̂b̂) = −(Π× b̂)× b̂, i.e., where all the b̂ act on Π from the
right. Alternatively, one can write a decomposition when all the b̂ act on the Π from the left, Π = b̂(b̂·Π)+(I − b̂b̂)·Π,
where the perpendicular part (I − b̂b̂) · Π = −b̂ × (b̂ × Π).
C. MHD DISPERSION RELATION

We assume that many people reading this text, will have some previous experience with MHD. It is therefore
beneficial to obtain the MHD dispersion relation, so that it will be clear how more advanced fluid models are treated
in this text. The MHD fluid model reads
∂ρ
+ ∇ · (ρu) = 0;
∂t
1

∂u
+ u · ∇u + ∇p −
(∇ × B) × B = 0;

ρ
4πρ
∂B
= ∇ × (u × B);
∂t
∂p
+ u · ∇p + γp∇ · u = 0,
(C9)
∂t
where γ = 5/3. As in advanced fluid models, it is beneficial to normalize the speed with respect to the Alfvén speed VA ,
and normalize the length with respect to the ion-inertial length di = VA /Ωp , i.e. by using normalizations (139)-(144),
which in Fourier space yields e
k = kdi , ω
e = ω/Ωp . Normalizing the MHD equations and dropping the tilde yields
unchanged density, induction and pressure equations, and the momentum equation reads
∂u
p(0) 1
1
+ u · ∇u +
∇p − (∇ × B) × B = 0.
∂t

(C10)

One can decide how to rewrite the p(0) /(ρ0 VA2 ), either by introducing the usual MHD sound speed Cs2 = γp(0) /ρ0 , or
by introducing the plasma beta

where we use the Boltzmann constant kB = 1, see the footnote after the definition of thermal speeds (146). By
specifying the mean magnetic field to be in the z-direction, the normalized equations are linearized according to
∂ρ

(C12)

and without a loss of generality, we consider propagation in the x-z plane (with ∂y = 0). By considering a wave
propagating with wavenumber k = (k sin θ, 0, k cos θ) = (kx , 0, kz ) = (k⊥ , 0, kk ), i.e. a wave propagating in the
direction that makes an angle θ with respect to B0 , the MHD system written in Fourier space reads
−ωρ + (k sin θ)ux + (k cos θ)uz = 0;
β

yielding the MHD dispersion relation for the Alfvén mode ωA = ±VA k cos θ = ±VA kk (sometimes called the shear
Alfvén mode), and the slow and fast modes (226).
In the limit β → 0 that corresponds to a cold plasma (Cs → 0) or a plasma with a very strong magnetic field
(VA → ∞), the slow mode ωs = ±Cs kk , and the fast mode ωf = ±VA k (sometimes called the compressional Alfvén
mode). In the limit β → ∞ that corresponds to the incompressible MHD (Cs → ∞) or a plasma with vanishing
magnetic field (VA → 0), the slow mode ωs = ±VA kk , and the fast mode ωf = ±Cs k. Note the difference in kk and k
in these two limits.

The equation appears very complicated, however, it is not overly so, since it is only a vector equation. The equation just

since the parallel components are zero (directly from the decomposition of S k )
k

S⊥ · b̂ = 0;

⊥
S⊥

(D43)

we actually do not have to evaluate the eq. (D35) with respect to b̂0 . For a general vector a, the following identity
holds b̂ × (b̂ × a) = b̂(b̂ · a) − a. So for a vector a which does not have any parallel components to b̂, so that b̂ · a = 0,
the identity is b̂ × (b̂ × a) = −a, and

Additionally, evaluation from linear kinetic theory in the gyrotropic limit (at long wavelengths) yields re⊥⊥ = 0, as we
will see in Part 2. With this requirement, the equation (D74) is equivalent to eq. 3.6 of Sulem & Passot (2015). The
result (D74) is also equivalent to expressions 55, 58 of Ramos (2005). However, eq. 15 of Macmahon (1965) appears
to have a typo, where in comparison to our (D73), his definition of T appears to be missing a factor of 2 in front of
the ∇u term. Ramos (2005) however states that his results are equivalent to those of Macmahon (1965), so we might
not correctly understand the notation in that paper.

where we have kept the re⊥⊥ contributions, just in case we need them in the future. Note that similarly to the

linearization of the vector S⊥ , the induction equation is completely eliminated at the linear level, and more elaborate
forms of induction equation will not have additional contributions.
D.4. 2nd-order heat flux vectors

Here we are interested only in the linear level contributions, which we want to use in the FLR pressure tensor.
Therefore, since we know that here we will linearize everything at the end, we can immediately get rid of the two heat
flux terms q∇ · u and (q · ∇u)S , and also replace the d/dt by ∂/∂t, so partial linearization yields

Alternatively, one can write ∂l Πlk − ∂z Πkz = ∂x Πxk + ∂y Πyk . The second order heat flux vectors contribute to scalar
(gyrotropic) pressure equations, and also to the FLR pressure tensor Π. The non-gyrotropic pressure tensor Π, and
k
⊥
the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors S⊥ , S⊥
are therefore generally coupled. To make the system easily solvable, terms
with Π on the r.h.s. of (D102), (D103) are approximated by Π(1) . The equations (D102), (D103) can be written in a
more elegant vector form, see eq. (536), (537), and the result is equivalent to equations 53, 54 of Passot et al. (2012).
k
⊥
Instead of splitting of Π, S⊥ and S⊥
to the first and second order components, one might be interested in the future
to check the behaviour of the coupled system. I.e., one might be interested in solving the pressure tensor equation,
that is coupled to the heat flux vectors, by making the associated variables as independent quantities. For example,
one might be interested to double check the solutions for the parallel firehose instability. The procedure how to obtain
k
⊥
time dependent equations for S⊥ and S⊥
can be perhaps a bit blurry from the steps outlined above, so let’s write it

one more time, only for S⊥ . One can work directly with the heat flux tensor equation (595), and keeping only terms
that contribute at the linear level, the partially linearized heat flux tensor equation reads

Considering parallel propagation (k⊥ = 0), these equations are coupled with equations for Πxz , Πyz , eq. (540), (541),
and also with equations for ux , uy , Bx , By , system (552). Now it should be easy to derive the dispersion relation, and
for example check, if the solutions for the parallel firehose instability are improved.
D.5. Contributions of q ng to various equations
Here we calculate contributions of q ng to the FLR pressure tensor, scalar heat flux equations, and scalar pressure
equations. Contributions to the FLR pressure tensor are calculated at the linear level by neglecting σ. Contributions
to scalar heat flux equations and scalar pressure equations are calculated nonlinearly. In these calculations, no specific
form of a distribution function is assumed.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO FLR PRESSURE TENSOR

For contributions to the FLR tensor Π, we need to calculate ∇ · q ng . To calculate it, we will neglect the heat flux
tensor σ, and use the decomposition of the heat flux tensor S, that can be figured out to be

The nonlinear results (D136), (D138) are exact, and here we do not address how to further decompose the tensor σ.
Finally, considering contributions at the linear level (assuming that the mean values of the entire heat flux q (0) = 0),
it is easy to see that

The heat flux tensor σ therefore does not contribute to the gyrotropic pressure equations at the linear level.
