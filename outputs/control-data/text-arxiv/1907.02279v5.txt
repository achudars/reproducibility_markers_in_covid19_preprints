FORMAL EXPANSIONS IN STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR
WAVE TURBULENCE 2: METHOD OF DIAGRAM
DECOMPOSITION
ANDREY DYMOV AND SERGEI KUKSIN
Abstract. We continue the study of small amplitude solutions of the
damped/driven cubic NLS equation, written as formal series in the amplitude, initiated in our previous work [4]. We are interested in behaviour of the formal series under the wave turbulence limit “the amplitude goes to zero, while the space-period goes to infinity”.

1. Introduction and results
In this paper we continue the study of the nonlinear cubic Shrödinger
equation (NLS) on a torus of large period, dumped by a viscosity and driven
by a random force, initiated in our work [4]. In the first two subsections we
recall the setup and state the main theorem, while in Sections 1.3 and 1.4
we discuss the results obtained in [4] and in the present work. We refer to
[4] for detailed discussion of the role of the results of two our papers for the
wave turbulence (WT), and refer to [12, 15, 13] for a general discussion of
WT.
1.1. The setting. Let TL = R /(LZ ) be a d-dimensional torus, d ≥ 1,
of period L ≥ 1. We denote by ∥u∥ the normalized L2 -norm of a complex
d

function u on TL , ∥u∥ = L ∫Td ∣u(x)∣ dx , and write the Fourier series

parameter. The modification of the nonlinearity by the term 2iλ∥u∥ u
keeps the main features of the standard cubic NLS equation, reducing some
non-crucial technicalities, see [4] for a detailed discussion.
The objective of WT is to study solutions of (1.2) under the wave turbulence limit L → ∞ and λ → 0 on long time intervals, usually while ”pumping
the energy to low modes and dissipating it in high modes”. To make this
rigorous, following Zakharov-L’vov [14], we consider the NLS equation (1.2)
dumped by a (hyper) viscosity and driven by a random force:

In [4] and in this paper we study formal decompositions in ρ of solutions
to eq. (1.5), regarding ρ as an independent parameter, and those of the
energy spectrum ns . In Sections 1.3 and 1.4 we present the results of [4],
−1/2
and there we assume that ρ ∼ ν
since due to [4] exactly under this
scaling a principal term of the decomposition in ρ for of energy spectrum
has a non-trivial behaviour under the limit (1.6).
1.2. The result. Let us take the Fourier transform of equation (1.5):

We fix 0 < T ≤ +∞ and study equation (1.5)=(1.7) with zero initial condition at τ = −T , so

To prove the theorem we approximate, with accuracy ν L , the ex(m) (n)
pectation Evs v̄s by a finite sum of integrals, independent from L and
parametrized by a suitable class of Feynman diagrams F. Next we study
the behaviour of each integral as ν ≪ 1. To this end, in Section 5, for every
diagram F we find a special coordinate system such that in these coordinates
the integral, corresponding to F, has the relatively simple explicit form:

while as a function of l it is piecewise smooth and fast decays as ∣l∣ → ∞.
Then in Sections 6 and 7 we prove that

Behaviour of energy spectra of small-amplitude solutions for nonlinear
equations when the space-period of the solution grows to infinity has been
intensively studied by physicists since the 1960’s. Last decade this problem
draw attention of mathematicians, see [11, 1] and discussion in introduction
to [4]. In [11, 1] decompositions of energy spectra to series of the form
(1.10) where examined, evoking techniques of Feynman diagrams, inspired
by the works [5, 6] (in [5, 6] the diagram techniques were used to analyse
expansions of solutions in different, but related situations). Our diagram

presentation is based on similar ideas, but is rather different from those
in the mentioned works. In particular our approach leads to an explicit
(m) (n)
integral presentation of the correlations Evs v̄s which may be treated by
asymptotical methods, developed in the present paper and in [4].
In the next two subsections we briefly present the results of [4] and explain
the role of Theorem 1.1 in the research, started there.
1.3. Kinetic limit. Let u(τ, x) be a solution of equation (1.5), so that
v(τ ) = F(u(τ )) is a solution of (1.7). We recall that the function
ZL ∋ s ↦ ns (τ ) = E∣vs (τ )∣
d

(1.16)

2

is called the energy spectrum of u. One of the objective of WT is to study
its behaviour under the limits (1.6) with a properly scaled ρ, see [14, 15, 12].
The order of limits is not quite clear but, as we mentioned above, in WT
−1
it is usually accepted that L grows to infinity much faster than ν (for a
discussion of other possibilities see introduction to [4]). Accordingly in [4]
we assume that
(1.17)

L≥ν

−2−δ

for some

δ > 0.

It is traditional in WT to study the quadratic in ρ truncation of series (1.10), postulating that it well approximates small amplitude solutions.
Thus motivated, in [4] we considered the process

̃ s (τ ) = ns (τ ) + ρns (τ ) + ρ ns (τ ) + ρ ns (τ ) + ρ ns (τ ).
(2)

Assuming d ≥ 2, we proved that ns ∼ ν as ν → 0 uniformly in L satisfying
(0)
(1)
(1.17), while a simple computation showed that ns ∼ 1 and ns = 0. This
2
indicates that the right scaling for ρ is such that ρ ν ∼ 1 as ν → 0, and
accordingly in (1.17) we chose ρ to be of the form
√ −1/2
2
, so that ρ ν = ε.
(1.20)
ρ = εν
Here 0 < ε ≤ 1 is a fixed small number (independent from ν and L). Us3 (3)
ing estimate (1.15), under the scaling (1.17), (1.20) we found that ∣ρ ns ∣,

∣ρ ns ∣ ≲ ε . Accordingly,

when ν → 0, since ns ∼ ν.
Thus, the parameter ε measures the properly scaled amplitude of oscillations, described by eq. (1.5), and indeed ε should be small for the methodology of WT to apply to study the energy spectrum. Next we establish that

6

for ν small in terms of ε, the energy spectrum n
̃ s (τ ) is ε -close to a function m(τ, s), which is a unique solution of the damped/driven wave kinetic

In particular, from what was said it follows that in our setting ρ ∼ ν
is
the only scaling of ρ when the energy spectrum admits a non-trivial kinetic
limit of order one; see [4] for a more detailed discussion.

Here the terms

min(⌈k/2⌉,d) k

∣ns ∣ ≤ C (s)((ν L + ν

where for definiteness we assumed that d ≥ 2. For k ≤ 2d in the exponent
in r.h.s. the minimum with d can be removed, so (1.24) takes the form
(1.25)

∣ns ∣ ≤ C (s)(ν

In particular, (1.25) holds for k ≤ 4 since d ≥ 2. Using estimate (1.25)
with k ≤ 2d it is straightforward to show that under the scaling (1.20)
the kinetic limit for quasisolution, established in [4] and discussed in the
m
i (i)
previous section, takes place for the truncation ∑i=0 ρ vs of series (1.10)
not only in order m = 2 as in (1.18) but in any order 2 ≤ m ≤ d (with the
2
same kinetic equation (1.21) and at least with the same accuracy ε ). If

STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR WAVE TURBULENCE 2: DIAGRAMS

it was true that (1.25) is valid for any k, then the kinetic limit would take
place for the truncation in any order m ≥ 2.

On the contrary, if for some k we have ∣n ∣1 ∶= L ∑s ∣ns ∣ ≫ ν
then

this is not the case as the term ρ n explodes as ν → 0.

Since, as explained above, the moments Evs v̄s can be approximated
−2 −2
by finite sums of integrals ∑F J̃s (F) with accuracy L ν , then they admit

finite limits when L → ∞ and ν stays fixed. So the limit ns

with ρ = ε/ν
if (1.25) holds for any k. √ Then the series ∑k=0 ρ ns
becomes a formal series in ε uniformly in ν, and it would be plausible that
it is an asymptotic of the limiting energy spectrum limL→∞ ns (τ ), where ns
k,∞
k/2
is defined in (1.16). On the contrary, if ∣n ∣1 ≫ ν
for some k then the
series is not a formal series uniformly in ν.
The question if estimate (1.25) holds for high k is complicated. Namely,
estimate (1.24) follows from (1.15), and in Theorem 1.1 we established the
latter by showing that each integral J̃s (F) is bounded by the r.h.s. of (1.15).
We are able to prove that this estimate is optimal at least for some integrals
J̃s (F) in the sense that for some of them the minimum with d in the exponent
cannot be removed, so for these terms estimate (1.25) fails. However, in
(m) (n)
the sum ∑F J̃s (F) that approximates Evs v̄s there are some non-trivial
cancellations in a few first orders of its decomposition in ν which could lead
to (1.25). In Section 8.1 we discuss this phenomenon in more detail.
In the next Section 2 we give some preliminaries and outline the proof of
the theorem. The rest of the paper, except some appendices, is devoted to
the proof itself.

2.1. Approximate equation. We start by getting rid of the term −iρL ∣vs ∣ vs
in the r.h.s. of equation (1.7) since the term is small but rather inconvenient
for our analysis. With this term being dropped, equation (1.7), (1.9) reads

Remark 2.2. In what follows, till the end of Section 5.3, we do not use the

give an outline of the proof of Theorem 2.1). Instead we assume that the
(m)

processes as are given by equation (2.14) where θ ∶ R ↦ C is a measurable
function with at most polynomial growth at infinity. In particular, we may
choose for θ the function θ(x, t) = I{0} (x), where I{0} (x) is the indicator
function of the point x = 0 (in this case θ does not depend on t). This
generalisation is used in our paper under preparation.

2.3. Outline of the proof of Theorem 2.1. We divide a quite detailed

The root of a diagram D, associated with a sum Ĩs , is the vertex as (τ1 ).

vertex. It corresponds to the factor δs′′ in (2.14), is coupled with the parent
(p)

as′ (t) by an edge and one can think that its role is to couple the block

with its parent. Similarly, each vertex ās′ (t) with degree p ≥ 1 generates
a block, where the three real vertices correspond to a choice of the terms

We denote by Dm the set of all diagrams D associated with different

terms Ĩs from (2.16), sum of which gives as (τ1 ). 3 Then in every diagram
D ∈ Dm there are m blocks, and in each block there are two conjugated
and two non-conjugated vertices. By convention, in each block we draw
and enumerate first the non-conjugated vertices and then the conjugated,

and the virtual vertex is always positioned at the second or forth place,
depending whether it is conjugated or not, see fig. 1(a).

We denote by ξ1 , . . . , ξ2m the indices sj ∈ ZL , enumerating the nonconjugated vertices, and by σ1 , . . . , σ2m – those enumerating the conjugated
vertices. Then, setting ξ0 = s, the diagram from fig. 1(a) takes the form as
in fig. 1(b). For more examples see fig. 2, 3(a-c), where we write c instead
of a and omit indices ξ and σ.
Now the linear relations, imposed on the vectors ξi , σj in a sum from

it remains to study equation (2.17)(1) in which we substitute σ = σ(ξ).

(0)
(0)
processes ak and āk (see Lemma 3.1). The construction is rather tedious
but the main difficulties are notational: once the diagrammatic language
is developed and convenient notation are introduced, proof of Lemma 3.1
becomes a simple computation.

3.1. The set of diagrams Dm ×Dn . For integers m, n ≥ 0 we define the set
Dm × Dn as a direct product of the sets of diagrams Dm and Dn , associated,
(n)
(m)
correspondingly, with the variables as and ās .
We start by constructing the set Dm , construction of Dn is similar. For
example, the set D1 consists of a unique diagram, which can be obtained
(0)
from the diagram in fig. 3(a) by erasing the isolated vertex c̄0 . Here each
(p)

cj

is regarded as an argument, which should be substituted by a variable

(p)
aξj (l),

(p)

(p)

while c̄j should be substituted by an āσj (l ). E.g., this substitution,
applied to the diagram in fig. 2(c), gives the diagram in fig. 1(b). The set
D2 consists of three diagrams in fig. 2. The set D3 consists of 12 diagrams,
two of which are given in fig. 3(b,c). Construction of the diagrams seems
to be quite clear from these examples. Nevertheless, below we explain it in
detail.
′

3.1.1. Agreements and first notation. Each diagram D ∈ Dm consists of a
number of vertices, some of them are coupled by edges. Each vertex is either
non-conjugated or conjugated. The non-conjugated vertices are denoted by
cj while the conjugated — by c̄j . If we do not want to indicate whether a
vertex is conjugated or not, we write it as ĉj . Each vertex is characterised
by its degree which we often write as an upper index:
(k)

deg ĉj

= k,

and each vertex is either virtual or real. If a vertex cj , c̄j or ĉj is virtual, we
usually write it as wj , w̄j or ŵj . Each virtual vertex ŵj has zero degree,
deg ŵj = 0,
so we do not write the upper index in the notation wj , w̄j , ŵj . Real vertices
of zero degree are called leaves.
The vertices of a diagram are organised in blocks of four, where the k-th
block, k ≥ 1, is {c2k−1 , c2k , c̄2k−1 , c̄2k }. Among these four vertices either the
vertex c2k or the vertex c̄2k is virtual, while the other are real. If the vertex
c2k is virtual then we denote this block by Bk ,
(3.1)

Bk = {c2k−1 , w2k , c̄2k−1 , c̄2k },

and call it the non-conjugated k-th block. If the vertex c̄2k is virtual, we
denote
(3.2)

B̄k = {c2k−1 , c2k , c̄2k−1 , w̄2k },

and call it the conjugated k-th block. If we do not want to emphasize whether
a block is conjugated or not, we denote it by B̂k . We define the degree of
each block as the sum of degrees of the forming it vertices. So
deg Bk ∶= deg c2k−1 + deg c̄2k + deg c̄2k−1
(since deg w̄2k = 0), and similarly for deg B̄k . E.g., the diagram from fig. 2(a)
has two conjugated blocks B̄1 and B̄2 , where deg B̄1 = 1 and deg B̄2 = 0.

Some diagrams from the set D3 . d) The unique diagram of
the set D1 .
3.1.2. Construction of the diagrams. If a vertex cj is coupled with a virtual
vertex w̄2k of a block B̄k then we say that cj generates the block B̄k . The
notion that a vertex c̄j generates a block Bk is defined similarly.
The set of diagrams Dm is constructed by the following inductive procedure. The set D0 is formed by a unique diagram which consists of a unique
(0)
(real) vertex c0 . If m ≥ 1, the root of each diagram D ∈ Dm is a real
(m)

vertex c0 . Each vertex ĉj of the diagram D with deg ĉj ≥ 1 (i.e. which is
real and is not a leave) generates a block B̂k satisfying
(3.3)

deg B̂k = deg ĉj − 1.

Non-conjugated vertices cj generate conjugated blocks B̄k while conjugated
vertices c̄j generate non-conjugated blocks Bk . The numeration of the blocks
(i.e. the dependence of k as a function of (ĉj )) is chosen in arbitrary way.
E.g., from the left to the right and from the top to the bottom, as in fig. 2,3.
Rule (3.3) does not determine uniquely the degrees of vertices in the block
B̂k , but fixes only their sum. So, for m ≠ 0, 1 the diagram D obtained by
the inductive procedure above is not unique. We define Dm as the set of all
possible diagrams obtained by this procedure.

Figure 4. A diagram from the set a) D2 × D0 and b) D1 × D2 .
The set of diagrams Dn is constructed by a similar procedure. The only
difference is that in diagrams D̄ ∈ Dn the root vertex is conjugated and has
(n)
the form c̄0 , see fig. 3(d). The set of diagrams Dn equals to the set Dn in
which we conjugate each diagram, and in every block of each diagram we
exchange positions of conjugated and non-conjugated vertices, so that the
non-conjugated vertices are situated first.
Finally, for a pair of diagrams D1 ∈ Dm and D̄2 ∈ Dn we consider the
diagram D1 ⊔ D̄2 , see fig. 3(a) and 4. Namely, we draw the diagrams D1 and
D̄2 side by side and enumerate the vertices of the diagram D̄2 (except the
root c̄0 ) not from 1 to 2n but from 2m + 1 to 2m + 2n. Thus, in D1 ⊔ D̄2 we
denote the two roots as c0 and c̄0 , then enumerate the remaining vertices of
the diagram D1 , and finally those of the diagram D̄2 . We define
Dm × Dn = {D1 ⊔ D̄2 ∶ D1 ∈ Dm , D̄2 ∈ Dn },

— this is the set, formed by all possible pairs of diagrams from the sets Dm
and Dn .
3.1.3. Properties of the set Dm × Dn and some terminology. Throughout
the paper we use the notation
N ∶= m + n.
The following properties of a diagram D ∈ Dm × Dn are obvious.
• The number of blocks of D equals to N .
• The diagram D has 4N + 2 vertices, half of them are conjugated while
another half are non-conjugated.
• If vertices ĉi and ĉj are coupled by an edge, we call them adjacent and
write ĉi ∼ ĉj . Each pair of adjacent vertices in D consists of a conjugated
(p)

(p)

and non-conjugated vertex, and has either the form (ci , w̄j ) or (c̄i , wj ),
where the degree p ≥ 1.
• An edge which joins ci with c̄j is denoted (ci , c̄j ) (either ci or c̄j is a
virtual vertex). Each diagram D ∈ Dm × Dn has N edges.
(0)
• Recall that a real vertex ĉj with zero degree is called a leaf. There is
no vertex in D which is adjacent to a leaf. The number of conjugated leaves
equals to the number of non-conjugated leaves and equals to N + 1.

vertex ĉi of a block B̂k , 1 ≤ k ≤ N , we assign a time variable lk ≥ −T . E.g.,
in the diagram from fig. 4(b) the times assigned to the vertices c2 and c̄6 are
l1 and l3 , respectively. To the roots c0 and c̄0 we assign the times τ1 and τ2 .
The vectors
l = (l1 , . . . , lN )
and
l = (τ1 , τ2 , l)
are called the vectors of times. Let

ξ = (ξ0 , . . . , ξ2N ),

σ = (σ0 , . . . , σ2N ),

(4N +2)d

where ξi , σj ∈ ZL , so (ξ, σ) ∈ ZL
, and we recall that 4N + 2 is the
number of vertices in D. These will be the indices for summation in a formula
(m)
(n)
for as (τ1 )ās (τ2 ). We assign the indices ξj to the non-conjugated vertices
and σj to the conjugated vertices in the following sense. We regard the real
vertices ĉj of the diagram D as (random) functions of the variables (l, ξ, σ).
Namely, we set

where t and t are the time variables (components of the vector l) assigned
(p)
(p)
(p)
to the vertices cj and c̄j respectively. We say that the vertices cj and
(p)

(p)

(p)

c̄j take values aξj (t) and āσj (t ). For virtual vertices wj and w̄j we say
that they take values wξj and w̄σj .

3.1.5. Restrictions on the indices (ξ, σ). To calculate a value of a diagram
(4N +2)d
.
D ∈ Dm ×Dn we may substitute in it any vector of indices (ξ, σ) ∈ ZL
At some stages of our constructions it will be necessary to put some restrictions on the vectors (ξ, σ) and substitute in the diagram only the vectors
which we call admissible. The set of all admissible vectors of indices (ξ, σ)
is denoted

where we take s, ξi , σj ∈ R rather than s, ξi , σj ∈ ZL to be able to extend

in view of condition (3.4), it can be not empty only if s ∈ ZL .
3.1.6. More notation. Let D ∈ Dm × Dn .
• We denote by E(D) the set of all edges of a diagram D, E(D) =
{(ci , c̄j )}.
• Let (ξ, σ) ∈ As (D) be an admissible index–vector. Then ξi = σj if
ci ∼ c̄j . Denoting by ϕ an edge ϕ = (ci , c̄j ), we set
(3.8)

γ (ξ, σ) ∶= γξi = γσj .
ϕ

• Recall that in each pair of adjacent vertices in D always one vertex
ϕ
ϕ
is real while another is virtual. Then, by lr and lw we denote the times
assigned to the real and virtual vertices, connected by the edge ϕ. So each
ϕ
lr,w is a mapping from E(D) to the set {τ1 , τ2 , l1 , . . . , lN }.
ĉ
• By l i we denote the time, assigned to a vertex ĉi .
• By
L(D), L̄(D) ⊂ {0, . . . 2N }

we denote the sets such that {ci }i∈L(D) and {c̄i }i∈L̄(D) form the sets of all
non-conjugated leaves and all conjugated leaves, correspondingly. In other
words, abusing notation and identifying the vertices with their values, we
(0)

have {ci }i∈L(D) = {aξi } and {c̄i }i∈L̄(D) = {āσi }. E.g., for the diagram from

the product of values of all leaves of the diagram D. The term lr − lw is
a difference of the times assigned to vertices, coupled by an edge ϕ, and
the corresponding exponent in GD (τ, l, ξ, σ) comes from the iteration of the
Duhamel formula (2.14) that generates ϕ. It appears together with the
indicator function I{−T ≤lwϕ ≤lrϕ } , which arises due to the fact that in (2.14)
the integration is performed not over R but only over the interval [−T, τ ].

The factor θ(ωj , ν lj ), entering the function Θ(ω, ν l), comes from the
iteration of the Duhamel formula, generating the j-th block of D.
The assertion of Lemma 3.1 easily (but clumsily) follows by iterating the
formula (2.14). Instead of giving a complete proof we restrict ourselves to
considering an example below.

In this section we compute the expectation Eas (τ1 )ās (τ2 ). Due to

(0)
the randomness enters Is (D) only via the product of values of leaves aξi ,
(0)

āσj in (3.10), which are Gaussian random variables. Since their correlations
are given by (2.15), due to the Wick theorem EIs (D) is given by a sum
(0) c
over all Wick pairings of values aξi (l i ) of non-conjugated leaves in D with
(0)

values āσj (l j ) of conjugated leaves. We parametrize this sum by Feynman
diagrams F (see [8] for the notion), which are obtained from the diagram D
by connecting the Wick paired leaves by edges, see fig. 5.
Next we give a detailed definition of Feynman diagrams and discuss related notions.

diagram. We never couple leaves ci and c̄j belonging to the same block
(0) (0)

since in this case the Wick pairing Eaξi āσj = 0 for every (ξ, σ) ∈ As (D),
because ξi ≠ σj by (3.5) (we recall the relation {s1 , s2 } ≠ {s3 , s} from (1.8)).
Let F(D) be the set of all Feynman diagrams, which may be obtained
from D using different partitions of the set of leaves to pairs. We define
(4.1)

Fm,n =

⋃

F(D).

D∈Dm ×Dn
(m) (n)

This is the set of all Feynman diagrams corresponding to the product as ās .
By construction, the set of vertices of any Feynman diagram F is partitioned
(p)
into pairs of adjacent vertices (ci , c̄j ). Each pair has either the form (ci , w̄j )
(p)

(0)

(0)

or (wi , c̄j ), where p ≥ 1, or the form (ci , c̄j ). Moreover, adjacent vertices never belong to the same block. To any D ∈ Dm × Dn the construction
above corresponds many diagrams F, but the inverse mapping
(4.2)

Fm,n → Dm × Dn ,

F ↦ DF ,

is well defined: the diagram DF is obtained from F by erasing the edges that
couple its leaves.
In fact, by assuming that in Feynman diagrams there are no coupled leaves
that belong to the same block, we have excluded only a part of vanishing
Wick pairings. To exclude the remaining part, in Section 5.2 we will replace
true
the set Fm,n of Feynman diagrams by a smaller set Fm,n ⊂ Fm,n . For the
true
Wick pairings corresponding to the diagrams F ∉ Fm,n the assumption
{s1 , s2 } ≠ {s3 , s} from (1.8) is again violated in (3.5), but in a less trivial
way (see Proposition 5.3).

4.1.1. Set of admissible indices As (F). Let us orient edges of a Feynman diagram F ∈ Fm,n in the direction from conjugated vertices to non-conjugated,

the permutation fF while (3.4) and (3.5) are obvious.

We also consider the discrete set As (F) = As (F) ∩ ZL

Our motivation behind this definition is as follows. As it is explained in
the beginning of section, each term EI(D) can be written as a sum over the
Feynman diagrams F,

Each summand Js (F) has the form (3.15) where GD is replaced by a function
(0)
(0)
obtained by the corresponding to F Wick pairing of values aξi , āσj of leaves.
In this formula for Js (F) we should take summation only over those vectors
L
(ξ, σ) ∈ As (D) for which ξi = σj once the vertices ci and c̄j are adjacent in
′L
F, that is over vectors of the form (ξ, ξfF ), where ξ ∈ As (F).

4.2. Formula for the expectation Eas ās . Below we introduce some
more notation. Let F ∈ Fm,n be a Feynman diagram.
• We denote by E(F) the set of edges of the diagram F, then E(DF ) ⊂
E(F) (see (4.2)). We also set
ED (F) ∶= E(DF ),

EL (F) ∶= E(F) \ ED (F)

so E(F) = ED (F) ⊔ EL (F).

• For an edge ϑ ∈ E(F) which couples some vertices ci and c̄j , we set
c

cϑ ∶= ci , c̄ϑ ∶= c̄j , and denote by l ϑ and l ϑ the times assigned to the vertices

Lemma 4.1 gives an explicit formula for the expectation Eas ās , how′L
ever, the structure of the set As (F), over which we take a summation in
(4.10), is too complicated for further analysis. In this section we find new
′L
coordinates in which the set As (F) and the quadratic forms ωj take convenient form.
′L
By (4.6) the vectors ξ ∈ As satisfy the system of equations
(5.1)

ξ2k−1 + ξ2k = σ2k−1 + σ2k ,

σ ∶= ξfF ,

1 ≤ k ≤ N.

We start with constructing coordinates x = (x0 , . . . , x2N ) where x0 = ξ0 and
for every 1 ≤ k ≤ N we set either x2k−1 = ξ2k−1 − σ2k−1 and x2k = ξ2k − σ2k
or x2k−1 = ξ2k−1 − σ2k and x2k = ξ2k − σ2k−1 , so that equations (5.1) take
trivial form x2k = −x2k−1 , ∀k. We will make a choice (different for different
k and dependent on the diagram F) between the two possibilities above in
such a way that the transformation ξ ↦ x is invertible. Then, components
′L
zk ∶= x2k−1 , 1 ≤ k ≤ N , form coordinates on the set As while components
x2k are functions of z = (zk )1≤k≤N .
To construct this transformation ξ ↦ x we add to the diagram F dashed
edges which couple vertices inside each block in such a way that the obtained
diagram becomes a Hamilton cycle, see fig. 6(b) (we show that it is always
possible to do). For every k we choose between the two possibilities above
in accordance with the dashed edges. It turns out that in the coordinates z,
F −1
ixt
constructed in such a way, the function Θ(ω , ν l) with θ(x, t) = e takes
a simple form (5.20)-(5.21), and we get a nice explicit formula for the sum
Js (F), which allows to analyse its asymptotic behaviour as ν → 0, L → ∞.
Next we explain construction of the transformation ξ ↦ x in detail.
5.1. Cycles CF , ĈF and permutation πF . Let us take a Feynman diagram
F ∈ Fm,n with N = m + n ≥ 2. By construction, if two vertices of F belong
to the same block then they are not adjacent. Now inside each block B̂k ,
k ≥ 1, (see (3.1)-(3.2)) we join by four dashed edges conjugated vertices with
non-conjugated in all possible ways, see fig. 6(a). We also join by a dashed
edge the two roots c0 , c̄0 and denote the resulting graph by UF .
Lemma 5.1. For each Feynman diagram F ∈ Fm,n the graph UF has a
Hamilton cycle in which solid and dashed edges alternate.
Proof of Lemma 5.1, given in Appendix 8.3, follows from the fact that the
diagram, made by the blocks of F, is connected. In general, the Hamilton
cycle in Lemma 5.1 is not unique, so we fix one for each diagram UF and
denote it as CF . Examples of the Hamilton cycles CF are given in fig. 6(b)
and fig. 9. It is straightforward to see that, by construction of the diagrams
UF , the cycles CF contain all solid edges of UF (which are the edges of F),

and a half of the dashed edges: for each block exactly two of four dashed
edges that couple vertices inside the block enter the cycle CF .
We orient the dashed edges of CF in the direction from non-conjugated
vertices to conjugated and recall that the solid edges are oriented in the
opposite direction, from conjugated vertices to non-conjugated. Then, CF
becomes an oriented cycle, see fig. 6(b).
Let us denote by ĈF the reduced oriented cycle CF , that is the cycle CF
in which we keep only non-conjugated vertices and ”forget” all conjugated
vertices, see fig. 7. The cycle ĈF defines a cyclic permutation πF of the set
{0, . . . , 2N } as
πF (j) = i if an edge of ĈF goes from cj to ci .

The graph UF and the Hamilton cycle CF play a central role in the presented
construction. Nevertheless, below we use only the ”derivative” objects: the
reduced cycle ĈF and the permutation πF .

5.2. The change of coordinates. For a fixed Feynman diagram F ∈ Fm,n

and define a (2N + 1)–vector x = (xj )0≤j≤2N , xj ∈ R . Since πF is a cyclic

{π(2k − 1), π(2k)} = {f (2k − 1), f (2k)}.

5Formula (5.4) admits the following interpretation. An element αF equals ±1 if the

arcs [c2i−1 , c2i ] and [c2j−1 , c2j ] are linked, and equals 0 otherwise. The sign ”+” or ”−”
is determined by the order of linking. See fig. 7.

Indeed, the permutation π encodes change of indices of non-conjugated vertices of the cycle CF under the double shift, the first along dashed edges
and the second along solid edges. The first shift preserves the set of indices
{2k − 1, 2k} while the second is encoded by the permutation f .

Now let us recall that the set As (F) consists of all vectors of indices ξ
satisfying (4.5) and (4.6) with σ = ξf . In view of what is told above, we have
′ξ2k−1 ξ2k
′ξ
ξ2k
= δξπ(2k−1)
{ξf (2k−1) , ξf (2k) } = {ξπ(2k−1) , ξπ(2k) }, so δξf2k−1

2k−1 2k
equation (4.6) is equivalent to δξπ(2k−1)
ξπ(2k) = 1, that is to the equation

(5.8)
joined with
(5.9)

ξ2k−1 + ξ2k = ξπ(2k−1) + ξπ(2k)
{ξ2k−1 , ξ2k } ∩ {ξπ(2k−1) , ξπ(2k) } = ∅.

Equation (5.8) is equivalent to (5.5)(b). The equality ξ0 = s from (4.5) is
equivalent to (5.5)(a) while the equality σ0 = s, in view of (5.3), takes the
form
(5.10)

s = ξf (0) =

∑

i∶ ci ∈[cf (0) ,c0 ]

xi .

Since f (0) = π(0), then [cf (0) , c0 ] = [cπ(0) , c0 ], and this interval contains
all vertices of the cycle ĈF . Then, using (5.5)(b), we see that the right-hand
side of (5.10) equals to x0 , so (5.10) again takes the form (5.5)(a).
Now it remains to show that (5.9) is equivalent to (5.6). In view of (5.8),
relation (5.9) is equivalent to
and ξ2k−1 ≠ ξπ(2k) .

ξ2k−1 ≠ ξπ(2k−1)

∑

i∶ ci ∈[cπ(2k) ,c0 ]

Let us first assume that cπ(2k) ∈ [c2k−1 , c0 ] and cπ(2k) ≠ c2k−1 . Then identity
above takes the form
ξ2k−1 − ξπ(2k) =

∑

i∶ ci ∈[c2k−1 ,c2k ]

xi ,

where we have used that the vertex situating in ĈF before cπ(2k) is c2k . In
view of the assumption above, c0 ∉ [c2k−1 , c2k ]. Then, due to cancellations
provided by (5.5)(b), we get (5.11).
The case cπ(2k) ∉ [c2k−1 , c0 ] can be considered similarly. If cπ(2k) = c2k−1 ,
that is π(2k) = 2k −1, then the both sides of equation (5.11) vanish. Indeed,
F
αki = 0 ∀i since the arc [c2k−1 , c2k ] contains all vertices cj ∈ ĈF .

Theorem 6.3 is proven in the next subsection. In Appendix 8.7 we note
that Theorem 6.3 implies an asymptotic estimate for a family of integrals of
some quotients with degenerate divisors, including those which are obtained
N
from the integrals J̃s (F) by explicit integration over Rl . That result is not
needed for the present paper however we believe that it is of independent
interest; it is related to [9].
In view of (5.19), the integrals J̃s (F) satisfy assumptions of Theorem 6.3
#
with the functions Cκ and the constants Cκ independent from τ1 , τ2 . Here,
F
in view of (5.21), we have qij ⋅ l = αij (li − lj ) and it can be shown that
the rank R satisfies R ≥ ⌈N /2⌉ (which follows solely from the fact that the
F
matrix α is skew-symmetric and does not have zero lines and columns). So

Theorem 6.3 implies estimate (6.1), where the function χd is replaced by

F
ψd . In the case R = d = ⌈N /2⌉ (which holds true for certain matrices α )
this estimate is slightly weaker than (6.1). Indeed, it gives

so compare to (6.1) we get an additional factor ln ν , unless N = 2, 3. This

To overcome this difficulty, in Theorem 7.1 we prove that if the tensor
k
(qij ) has a block-diagonal form, the estimate (6.6) improves and implies
(6.1). This is mostly a technical issue, and ideologically (6.1) follows from
(6.6). So, we postpone Theorem 7.1 till Section 7, and first show how to
prove the estimate (6.6).

7. Refinement of estimate (6.6) and proof of Theorem 6.1
In this section we establish Theorem 7.1, in which we improve estimate
(6.6), and deduce from it Theorem 6.1.
7.1. Refinement of (6.6). We consider integral (6.2), where to simplify
the formulation of result (and since it suffices for our purpose) we assume
M = K and denote N ∶= M = K ≥ 2. We consider a decomposition of the
set {1, . . . N } into p ≥ 1 non-empty disjoint subsets
{1, . . . N } = I1 ∪ . . . ∪ Ip ,

(7.1)

and denote l = (li )i∈Ik .
We assume that the phase function Q admits the decomposition

where in (6.4) we replace K by ∣Ii ∣. Denote by Rk the rank of the system
of ∣Ik ∣-vectors (qij )i,j∈Ik .

under assumption (7.2) we have

Proof. We argue by induction. In the case p = 1 the assertion follows from

7.2. Proof of Theorem 6.1. Recall that the phase function Ω from the
definition (5.23) of the integral J̃s (F) is given by (5.21) and that for F ∈
true
F
Fm,n the skew-symmetric matrix α does not have zero lines and columns.
F
Consider a partition (7.1) with p ≥ 1 such that the matrices αk = (αij )i,j∈Ik
F

are irreducible and αij = 0 once i ∈ Ik and j ∈ Ir with k ≠ r. Then the
F
integral J̃s (F) satisfies assumptions of Theorem 7.1 with qij ⋅ l = αij (li − lj ).

Lemma 7.2. Let A = (aij ) be an irreducible n × n-matrix, n ≥ 2, and the
n
vectors rij ∈ R be given by rij = aij (ei − ej ), where (ei )1≤i≤n is a basis in
n
R . Then rank R of the system of n-vectors (rij )1≤i,j≤n equals n − 1.

Proof of Lemma 7.2 is a simple exercise from linear algebra and we postpone it to Appendix 8.5. Set Nk = ∣Ik ∣. Since the Nk × Nk -matrices αk are
skew-symmetric and non-zero, we have Nk ≥ 2. Applying Lemma 7.2 to the

STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR WAVE TURBULENCE 2: DIAGRAMS

39

system of vectors (qij )i,j∈Ik , we see that its rank Rk equals to Nk − 1. Then
by Theorem 7.1 we get the estimate
p

∣J̃s (F)∣ ≤ C (s) ∏ ν

(7.3)

i=1

Let us show that (7.3) implies the desired estimate (6.1). Assume first that
Ni − 1 < d for every 1 ≤ i ≤ p. Then, in view of (7.3) and the identity
p
∑i=1 Ni = N , we have
∣J̃s (F)∣ ≤ C (s)ν
#

N −p

.

Since Ni ≥ 2 for any i, the number of blocks p satisfies p ≤ ⌊N /2⌋, where
N −p
⌊⋅⌋ denotes the (lower) entire part. Then N − p ≥ ⌈N /2⌉, so we get ν
≤
⌈N /2⌉
ν
which implies (6.1).
Now we assume that
(7.4)
so ν
find

Nj − 1 ≥ d for some

min(Nj −1,d)

1 ≤ j ≤ p,

d

= ν . Since for every i we have ν

In the case p ≥ 2 this implies (6.1). Now it remains to consider the case
when (7.4) holds with p = 1. Then N − 1 ≥ d. If N − 1 > d then (7.3) with
p = 1 implies (6.1). Otherwise N − 1 = d, so

N = 3 or d = 1, N = 2. In these cases we find N − 1 = ⌈N /2⌉ = d, which is
2 or 1 correspondingly, so again (7.5) implies (6.1).

Let Fm,n ⊂ Fm,n be a subset of Feynman diagrams F for which there is

q = q(F) such that the matrix α from (5.21) satisfies αij = 0 if both i ≠ q

and j ≠ q (so, all elements of the matrix α outside the q-th line and column

F ∈ Fm,n we have C1 (s)ν ≤ ∣J̃s (F)∣ ≤ C2 (s)ν .

Proposition 8.1 shows that the first estimate from (8.3) is false for F ∈
2
Fm,n when N > 2d, so in general we have only (8.2). Then, if the large
d
integrals J̃s (F) of the size ν did not cancel each other in the sum from
(8.1), the second estimate from (8.3) would also fail. Moreover, if they did
k
not cancel in the sums from (1.23) that give ns , then as we have discussed
in Section 1.4, this would imply that the energy spectrum corresponding
m

to a truncation ∑i=0 ρ vs with m > d of the decomposition (1.10) can not
be approximated by a solution of the WKE (1.21). However, we find some

2
F ∉ Fm,n for which the corresponding integrals also are large (bigger than

Discussion of proofs of Propositions 8.1, 8.2 and of Problem 8.3. Below
we do not give proofs but present only their rough ideas. Let us consider
F
F
N
the matrix αl = (αij (li − lj ))1≤i,j≤N , which depends on l ∈ R (see (5.21)).
Since it is symmetric, it has N real eigenvalues, which we enumerate in the
N
decreasing order ∣λ1 (l)∣ ≥ ∣λ2 (l)∣ ≥ . . . ≥ ∣λN (l)∣ ≥ 0, for any l ∈ R . It
2
is possible to show that the set Fm,n can be equivalently defined as follows.
k
For k ≥ 1 we denote by Fm,n a set of Feynman diagrams F for which the
eigenvalues λ1 (l), . . . , λk (l) are not identically zero while λi (l) ≡ 0 for any
F
i ≥ k + 1. Since the matrix αl is non-zero but has zero trace, we have
k
N
true
1
Fm,n = ∅, so Fm,n = ∪k=2 Fm,n .
2
Let us take a diagram F ∈ Fm,n and consider the integral over dz from the
definition (5.23) of J̃s (F). Applying to it the Parseval identity in the eigendirections corresponding to the eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 , and using that for F ∈
F
hs (l) dl
d
2
̃
Fm,n we have λ3 = . . . = λN = 0, we find that Js (F) ∼ ν ∫
RN ∣λ1 (l)λ2 (l)∣d/2
F
if N > 2d, for an appropriate integrable function hs , which is fast decaying
F 2
2
in s. Due to Lemma 6.4, we have λ1 λ2 = − 21 ∑ (αij ) (li − lj ) . Us1≤i,j≤N

ing this formula, we show that the latter integral converges, which proves
Proposition 8.1.
Below by a graph of a Feynman diagram we mean the diagram, where
we do not specify which vertices are virtual, which have positive degree and
which are leaves, so the graph is just a collection of vertices coupled by
edges. To establish Proposition 8.2, we note that, up to a renumbering of
2
2
vertices, all diagrams F ∈ Fm,n have the same graph which we denote by G .
2
To recover the set of diagrams Fm,n from this graph, it suffices to look over
all possible placings of virtual vertices (once positions of the virtual vertices
are known, degrees of the other vertices are recovered uniquely).
2
The graph G is such that in a k-th block with any k ≠ 1, m + 1, the
virtual vertex can be placed in two different positions, c2k or c̄2k . Now,
using the stationary phase method [2, 7], we develop each integral J̃s (F) in
ν. Change of position of a virtual vertex inside of a block, roughly speaking,
changes only the sign in first p orders of this decomposition. This is where
the cancellations come from. The number p here equals to the number of
blocks in which position of the virtual vertex is not determined uniquely,
that is p = N − 2. After some work, we deduce from this Proposition 8.2.

42

ANDREY DYMOV AND SERGEI KUKSIN

Let us now discuss Problem 8.3. Take a diagram F0 ∉ Fm,n and consider
its graph GF0 . We expect that in the sum
∑

(8.5)

F∈Fm,n
∶ GF =GF0

J̃s (F)
2

there are similar cancellations. However, the graph G is ”very symmetric”
(we are able to draw it explicitly), while for a general diagram F0 there are
less symmetries in the graph GF0 . That is why we expect that in the sum
(8.5) the number p of orders, in which the cancellations take place, is smaller
than in the sum from Proposition 8.2, so we expect to get less ”additional
degrees” of ν than in Proposition 8.2. Then the estimate (8.4) can be true
only if the integrals J̃s (F) are smaller than those from Proposition 8.2, once
N > 2d. Namely, if there exists r > d sufficiently large such that for the
#
r
diagrams F satisfying GF = GF0 we have ∣J̃s (F)∣ ≤ C (s)ν .
It is plausible that this is indeed the case and below we explain the reason.
k
Let k > 2 be such that F0 ∈ Fm,n . Then it is possible to show that F ∈
k
Fm,n as well for any diagram F satisfying GF = GF0 . Then, arguing as
in the proof of Proposition 8.1 and applying the stationary phase method
in the eigendirections corresponding to the eigenvalues λ1 , . . . , λk , we get

we do not know a good estimate from below for the product λ1 (l)⋯λk (l)
in the case k > 2, in difference with the situation when k = 2 considered in
Proposition 8.1.

which take values aξf (j) and āσj ); denote the obtained diagram by Ff . The
summation over the bijections f in (8.6) can be replaced by the summation
over the diagrams Ff .
The only difference between the set F(D) of Feynman diagrams obtained
from the diagram D with the set of diagrams Ff is that, by definition, in
any F ∈ F(D) there are no leaves from the same block which are adjacent.

for any j ∉ L(F). Inequality (8.9) easily follows from assumption (4.6).
(p)
Indeed, since for j ∉ L(F) a vertex cj has positive degree p ≥ 1, it is coupled
′
in F with a virtual vertex w̄2k . Then, for ξ ∈ As (F) we have fF (2k) = j, so
(4.6) implies ξ2k−1 + ξ2k = ξfF (2k−1) + ξj . Then, among the indices ξ2k−1 , ξ2k
and ξfF (2k−1) there is at least one, say ξ2k−1 , satisfying ∣ξ2k−1 ∣ ≥ ∣ξj ∣/3. If
(p )

1
2k − 1 ∈ L(F) then we get (8.9), so we are done. Otherwise, the vertex c2k−1
is not a leaf and we continue the procedure in the same way until we arrive
at a leaf. If it is ξ2k or ξfF (2k−1) who dominates ∣ξj ∣/3 then we argue in the
same way.
Now we establish the estimate (8.8). We recall that ED (F) is the set
of edges of the diagram F which couple its virtual vertices with vertices of
positive degree. Fix any 1 ≤ k ≤ m. There exist edges ϕ1 , . . . , ϕp ∈ ED (F)
(m)
which form a path from the block B̂k of the diagram F to the root as .
That is, the edge ϕ1 couples the virtual vertex of the block B̂k with a
vertex of a block B̂j1 , the edge ϕ2 couples the virtual vertex of the block
B̂j1 with a vertex from a block B̂j2 , etc. Finally, the edge ϕp couples the
(m)
(here, essentially, B̂jp−1 =
virtual vertex of the block B̂jp−1 with the root c
B1 ). Accordingly to the indicator function in (8.8), the times lk , lj1 , . . . , ljp−1
assigned to the blocks B̂k , B̂j1 , . . . , B̂jp−1 satisfy −T ≤ lk ≤ lj1 ≤ . . . ≤ ljp−1 ≤
τ1 . Then, bounding by one those exponents from (8.8) which correspond to

8.3. Proof of Lemma 5.1. Let us consider a graph CF which is obtained
from UF by erasing in each block two (of four) dashed edges. We choose the
′
edges we preserve arbitrarily, but in such a way that in the graph CF each
vertex is incident to exactly two edges, one of which is solid and another
one is dashed. We will modify the choice of the preserved dashed edges in
′
′
certain blocks of CF in such a way that CF will become a cycle. Since in the
′
′
graph CF every vertex is incident to two edges, CF decouples to a union of
k ≥ 1 disjoint cycles Ci , 1 ≤ i ≤ k, in which solid and dashed edges alternate.
If k = 1 then we are done. Assume that k > 1. We claim that in this case
there exists a block B̂r = {c2r−1 , c2r , c̄2r−1 , c̄2r } such that some but not all
of its vertices belongs to cycle C1 .
Indeed, assume that the claim is not true, so that each block either entirely
belongs to the cycle C1 , or its intersection with C1 is empty. Take a block B̂p
belonging to C1 . Then any vertex ĉj ∉ B̂p which is adjacent with a vertex
′
from the block B̂p (by construction of CF such vertex exists), belongs to the
cycle C1 and, consequently, all other vertices from the block to which belongs

ĉj belong to C1 as well. Arguing in this way, by induction we obtain that
′
the cycle C1 contains all blocks of the diagram CF , as well as the vertices c0
′
and c̄0 . Thus, C1 = CF which contradicts to the assumption k > 1, so the
claim is true.
′
Let B̂r be a block as in the claim. By construction of the diagram CF ,
its dashed edges either provide the couplings c2r−1 ∼ c̄2r−1 and c2r ∼ c̄2r
or the couplings c2r−1 ∼ c̄2r and c2r ∼ c̄2r−1 . For definiteness, we assume
that c2r−1 ∼ c̄2r−1 ∈ C1 and c2r ∼ c̄2r ∈ C2 , as in fig. 8(a). Let us erase the
(dashed) edges that couple the vertices c2r−1 with c̄2r−1 and c2r with c̄2r ,
and instead couple the vertices c2r−1 with c̄2r and c2r with c̄2r−1 . Then from
′′
′
the diagram CF we obtain another diagram CF , constructed from UF in the
′
same way as the diagram CF , in which there is one cycle C12 instead of the
′
two disjoint cycles C1 and C2 in CF , see fig. 8(b). So the total number of
′′
cycles in the diagram CF is k − 1, where we recall that by our assumption
′
in CF there are k > 1 cycles. Then, arguing by induction, we arrive at a
diagram CF which is a cycle itself.

the product over the set ED (F) in the formula (4.7) and the last to lines

compute the integral over the time variable dl in (5.23) and discuss the

8.5. Proof of Lemma 7.2. Since the matrix A is irreducible, there exists k
and indices i1 , . . . , ik satisfying ij ≠ ij+1 ∀j, such that ai1 i2 ai2 i3 ⋯aik−1 ik ≠ 0
and the sequence i1 , . . . , ik contains every number from 1 to n. We construct a set B of linearly independent vectors rij by the following inductive
procedure. For the base of induction we consider the indices i1 , i2 and set
B = {ri1 i2 }. For the inductive step, we assume that the indices i1 , . . . , im−1
are already considered, and we consider the index im . If the set B does not
contain any vector ruv for which u = im or v = im then we add the vector
rim−1 im to B and pass to the next step. Otherwise we just pass to the next
step. We conclude the procedure when all indices i1 , . . . , ik are considered.
Since the sequence i1 , . . . , ik contains every 1 ≤ j ≤ n, after the end of
the procedure above we have ∣B∣ = n − 1. Due to the form of the vectors
rij , vectors from the set B are linearly independent, so the rank R satisfies
R ≥ n − 1. Thus, it remains to show that R < n. If R = n then the basis
vectors em can be uniquely expressed through the vectors rij . However, this
is not possible since the vectors rij are invariant with respect to translations
of the set (ei ): if we replace ei by ei + e for every i and a vector e then the
vectors rij remain unchanged.

8.6. Integrals J̃s (F) in which the time variable l is integrated out.
In this appendix we integrate out the time variable l in the integrals J̃s (F),
which are defined in (5.23). We believe that it is relevant for further study of
the energy spectrum (1.23) of quasisolutions since for the moment of writing
we know asymptotical as ν → 0 behaviour of the integrals J̃s (F) only in case
N = 2, and to find it we have to write the integrals in such integrated in
l form. See in [4], where we found this asymptotic and, using a particular
case of Theorem 5.7, deduced from it the asymptotical as ν → 0, L → ∞
(1) 2
behaviour of the moment E∣as ∣ . Note, however, that in case of general
N , even to get an upper bound for the integrals J̃s (F) in Theorem 6.3 we
write them in the form (5.23) and we do not know how to get the upper
bound using their integrated in l form.

in divisors. In Lemma 8.4 we integrated out the time variable l in the

of quotients with large quadratic forms in divisors, see (8.11),(8.13). In
Theorem 6.3 we got an upper bound for a family of integrals of quotients
that have more general form than the integrals J̃s (F). As a corollary, in
this appendix we obtain an upper bound for a natural family of integrals of
more general form than those in (8.11),(8.13).

Γ1 = Γ2 and Q1 = −Q2 , where the quadratic form Q1 was assumed to be
non-degenerate and to have the index of the form (m, m), for some m. This
result plays a crucial role in [4] when analysing the asymptotic behaviour
(2)
of the term n from the decomposition (1.19). In particular, it was shown

that J ∼ ν which is in accordance with the estimate (8.15). The family of
integrals (8.14) is significantly more complicated than that from [9], however,
we get only the upper bound for them and for the moment we do not now
how to find their asymptotic behaviour. See also [10] for a related result, as

see that assumptions on the functions G and Γk imply that the function F
−δC x
satisfies (6.3) with l0 = 0 and hκ (x) = Cκ e Γ , where the constant δ > 0
is sufficiently small and Cκ > 0 are sufficiently large.
Since tr Ak = 0 for any k, assumptions of Theorem 6.3 are fulfilled, so the
ν
#
integral J satisfies the estimate (6.6) (with C (s) replaced by C), where
R denotes the rank of the family of vectors (qij )1≤i,j≤M . Thus, it remains to
show that R = r (cf. Remark 6.2). To this end we order somehow elements
of each matrix Ak and write it as a column vector Ã k (the ordering is the
same for every matrix Ak ). Then rows of the matrix A ∶= (Ã1 , . . . , ÃK ) are
vectors qij . So, rank of the set columns of the matrix A equals to r while
rank of the set of rows equals to R, which implies r = R.
