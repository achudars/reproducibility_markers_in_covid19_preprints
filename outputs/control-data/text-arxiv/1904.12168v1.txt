Abstract—In this paper, the uplink adaptation for massive
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) networks without the
knowledge of user density is considered. Specifically, a novel
cooperative uplink transmission and detection scheme is first
proposed for massive MIMO networks, where each uplink frame
is divided into a number of data blocks with independent coding
schemes and the following blocks are decoded based on previously
detected data blocks in both service and neighboring cells.
The asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of
the proposed scheme is then derived, and the distribution of
interference power considering the randomness of the users’
locations is proved to be Gaussian. By tracking the mean and
variance of interference power, an online robust rate adaptation
algorithm ensuring a target packet outage probability is proposed
for the scenario where the interfering channel and the user
density are unknown.

I. I NTRODUCTION
As a technique offering sufficient degree of freedom and
considerable spatial multiplexing gain by using large numbers
of antennas, massive MIMO has a great potential to boost
the throughput of cellular networks. However, the issue of
pilot contamination [1], which refers to the undiminished
inter-cell interference caused by pilot reuse, may severely
degrade the performance of massive MIMO networks. One
straightforward approach to mitigate the inter-cell interference
in channel estimation is the soft pilot reuse scheme [2], [3],
where pilot sequences are only reused at the center of cells
and hence its overhead is large. There are also some works
introducing compressive-sensing-based channel estimation algorithms to exploit the sparsity in massive MIMO channel
[4]. All these works exploit the channel spatial correlation.
In contrast, there are some works considering massive MIMO
transmission schemes without such correlation. For example
in [5], the authors proposed to synchronize the uplink channel
estimation with the downlink transmission of neighboring
cells. However, this might cause severe interference between
BSs in practice. Another promising approach addressing the
issue of pilot contamination is to utilize the data symbols
in channel estimation. Channel estimation schemes based on
superimposed pilots was proposed in [6], [7], where pilot and
data symbols are transmitted alongside each other for the
entire duration of the uplink frame. We proposed to utilize
temporal channel correlation and detected data symbols to
improve channel estimation in [8] without the consideration of
BS cooperation. Moreover, in [9]–[12], we proposed to divide
the uplink frame into blocks and to utilize the detected data

blocks as equivalent pilots for the successive data detection. In
[13], pilots of different lengths are assigned to cell-center users
and cell-edge users to suppressing the pilot contamination
efficiently.
To study the network performance, it is important to consider the randomness on the users’ geometric distribution.
There exist a number of works on the massive MIMO performance analysis with the tool of stochastic geometry. For
example, an analysis on the asymptotic SINR distribution in
the uplink was given in [14] with maximum ratio combining
(MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers. However, in these
works, the network performance is derived by randomizing
the locations of both BSs and users. The conclusions of
these works cannot be applied directly on one particular
network with fixed locations of BSs. Nevertheless, although
performance with fixed BSs’ locations is studied in [15]–
[18], it assumes uniform distribution of users, which may
not match the practical scenario. Moreover, the performance
distribution derived in these works is complicated, and the
further parameter adaptation based on it may be intractable.
A. Our Contributions
In this paper, we consider the uplink transmission of a
massive MIMO network, where the user density is unknown.
The main contributions are summarized below.
• In this paper, we propose a scheme where the uplink
frame is divided into data blocks with independent
channel coding schemes, and the data symbols in the
detected data blocks can be shared among neighboring
BSs for the estimation of dominant interfering channels.
Therefore, inter-cell interference from these channels can
be mitigated, and better performance than the schemes in
[10], [11] can be obtained. Moreover, we prove that the
asymptotic distribution of interference power is Gaussian,
even without uniform user distribution.
• We consider the practical scenario that the user density
is unknown, and the interfering channel is not measured
at the service BSs. In this case, neither the accurate
value nor the distribution of uplink SINR is known at
the beginning of transmission, which leads to potential
packet outage (the transmission data rate is larger than the
channel capacity). Exploiting the fact that the interference
is Gaussian, a robust rate adaptation algorithm given a
target packet outage probability is proposed. Moreover,
we also show that the distribution statistics of interference

power can be analytically derived for all other users as
long as they have been learned for a few number of users.

A. Uplink Model of Massive MIMO Network
The uplink transmission of a massive MIMO cellular
network is considered, where BSs are deployed on a 2dimensional plane R2 . The number of antennas at each BS
is M . It is assumed that there is one BS locating at the origin.
It is treated as the target BS of analysis for convenience. Each
BS (or cell) is assigned with an index, and the index of the
target BS (or cell) is 1. The location of the i-th BS (∀i) is
denoted by a 2-dimensional vector li . There can be multiple
users, each with single antenna, in each cell. Due to random
packet arrival, not every user has uplink data in each frame.
We refer to the users with uplink data as active users. The
distribution of all active uplink users in one frame, is modeled
as an SPPP Πu on R2 with density λu (l) for location l ∈ R2 .
The user density may vary for different locations. It is assumed
that 0 < λlu ≤ λu (l) ≤ λuu for all l ∈ R2 , where λlu and λuu
are two positive constants. The distance-based association [2]
are considered in this paper where users are associated to BSs
with minimum distance (pathloss). Let Φ` be the set of active
users in the `-th cell and |Φ` | be the cardinality of set Φ` .
The block fading channel is considered, where the channel
is quasi-static within one uplink frame and varies in different
frames. For the elaboration convenience, we only consider the
uplink transmission within coherence bandwidth of one frame.
To facilitate the proposed scheme, the uplink frame is divided
into N +1 blocks, where the 0-th block containing Lp symbols
is for pilot transmission, and the following blocks (from the
1-st block to the N -th one) are for uplink data transmission.
Let Bi be the number of symbols in the i-th (i = 1, 2, ..., N )
N
P
data block, and L =
Bi be the total length of all data
i=1

blocks. The modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for each
data block can be independently adapted. We assume that the
length of pilot sequences is sufficiently large and only consider
the situation of Lp ≥ |Φ` |, ∀`, in the analysis.
Each user has a unique index in its service cell. The kth user in the `-th cell is referred to as the (`, k)-th user,
whose location is denoted by a 2-dimensional vector l`,k . The
notations on the uplink transmission are listed in the following.

the (`, k)-th user. A set of orthogonal pilot sequences are

I is an identity matrix, σ is the pathloss exponent. It
is assumed that χ1`,k = 10ζ/10 , where is ζ a Gaussian
random variable with zero mean and standard deviation
θ. Similarly, let ρi`,k and χi`,k be the large-scale fading
coefficient and shadowing from the (`, k)-th user to the
i-th BS, respectively. In order to simplify the expressions,
we shall neglect the superscript 1 and use ρ`,k and χ`,k to
represent the large-scale fading coefficient and shadowing
from the (`, k)-th user to the target BS in remaining parts.

A. Asymptotic Uplink SINR
Since the active users are independently distributed, we only
provide the uplink SINR analysis of the first active user in the
target cell. The first user of the target cell is called as the
target user in the remainder of this paper. With the proposed
scheme, the uplink SINR of the target user is then given
by (3) and (4) for i ≤ d − 1 and i ≥ d, respectively. In
both SINR expressions, the terms I, II and III are due to the
intra-cell interference, channel estimation error, and inter-cell
interference, respectively. The expectation is taken over all
possible small-scale fading in other cells.
Then, the asymptotic expressions of the uplink SINR when
there are sufficient data symbols involved in channel estimation are given by the following lemma.

Interference II

From Lemma 1, we can observe that the uplink interference
in (5) is due to the users outside target cell Φ1 when i ≤ d−1,
and the users outside Φ1 ∪ Φ1co when i ≥ d + 1. Thus BS
cooperation will lead to better performance. It can be observed
that the SINR of the target user is a function of the locations of
interfering users, which are usually unknown to each service
BS. Hence, the accurate value of uplink SINR is hard to
predict before transmission. Considering the randomness in
active user distribution, we continue to analyze the distribution
of the asymptotic SINR in the following subsections, which
is necessary for robust rate allocation with a target outage
probability.
B. Asymptotic SINR Distribution
The asymptotic CDF expression of the SINR distribution is
given by the following theorem.
Theorem 1 (Asymptotic CDF of SINR for Distance-based
Cell Association). For sufficiently large L†i and M , the CDF

With the knowledge of λu , Mi+1 and Vi+1 can be calculated numerically using (7) and (8), and the corresponding
distribution of SINR can be obtained. In fact, a more practical
way is to learn these two parameters in real time since λu (l)
is usually unknown at the BSs. The online learning method is
elaborated in the following section.
IV. U PLINK R ATE A DAPTATION
Note that the uplnik SINR expression derived in (5) is the
function of the large-scale fading coefficients of interfering
channels, which is unknown to each service BS. For example,
ρ`,j (∀` 6= 1) are usually not measured at the target BS due to
large signaling overhead. In fact, not only the accurate value
of uplink SINR, but also its distribution derived in Theorem
1 are hard to predict due to the lack of knowledge on density
λu . This raises an issue on robust uplink rate allocation, which
will be addressed in the following Section IV-A via an online
learning algorithm.
A. Learning-based Uplink Rate Adaptation

In this section, we demonstrate the performance of the

the analytical results derived in the previous sections. As
a comparison, we also show the simulation results for the
data-assisted uplink scheme in [10] (denoted as the baseline

a hexagonal cellular network is considered. The cell radius

In this paper, a cooperative uplink transmission and detection scheme for massive MIMO networks is proposed and
analyzed. Based on it, learning-based algorithms are proposed
to adapt the uplink data rate without the knowledge of active
user distribution density. It is shown by simulations that the
proposed scheme can significantly improve the uplink SINRs
of the back data blocks in each uplink frame.

schemes demonstrates the performance of massive MIMO
system without data-assisted detection. Taking the 3-rd block
of the baseline scheme as an example, when data symbols are
used as equivalent pilot sequence, there are around 1dB and
5dB gains for the cell-center and cell-edge users, respectively.
Hence, the data-assisted detection scheme benefits more on
cell-edge users. This is because the cell-edge users suffer more
on the inter-cell interference. In both figures, our proposed
scheme outperforms the baseline scheme. This is because the
pilot information and data symbols of the closest interfering
users are used for channel estimation in the proposed scheme.
In Fig. 4, we check the convergence of online learning
algorithm, where the learning process of mean and variance
in (6) is demonstrated. The target user is 50 m away from
the service BS. The average number of users per cell is 10.

When Li is sufficiently large, the noise item can be approximated by P M1ρ1,1 .
Note that for high SNR region and sufficiently large M , the
noise item and interference term I are negligible compared
with the interference term II and III. As Li ≈ Li − 1, the

can be derived from (16) and
(32). When i ≥ d, the proof is similar, due to page limitation,
it is omitted here.
