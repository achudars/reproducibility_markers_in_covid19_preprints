Abstract
This preprint mainly reflects the new chapter we are prepearing for
the second edition of our book ”Gravitational Solitons” (V. Belinski and
E. Verdaguer). However, here it is written in the form of more or less
self-consistent paper dedicated to the mathematical theory of black holes
immersed in the external electromagnetic field. The purpose of this development is to describe the procedure by which one can construct a number
of axially symmetric black holes or naked singularities arranged along
the symmetry axis and immersed in an (also axially symmetric) external
electromagnetic field.

Introduction
Equilibrium states

In the non-relativistic physics two particles can be in equilibrium if the product
of their masses is equal to the product of their charges (in appropriate units).
However, the analogous question in General Relativity is far from being trivial.
Besides the natural mathematical complications, in General Relativity arise two
different types of the ”point” centers, namely Kerr - Newman black holes (BH)
and Kerr - Newman naked singularities (NS). Therefore, seeking equilibrium
configurations, one has to consider all three possible types of binary systems:
• black hole - black hole (BH-BH),
• black hole - naked singularity (BH-NS),
• naked singularity - naked singularity (NS-NS).
Due to the known solitonic generating technique [1] the construction of solutions for such binary systems in stationary states do not represents principal
difficulties, but it is quite intricate task to single out from these solutions the
1

physically reasonable cases because such solutions possess some features unacceptable from the physical point of view. These unwanted traits are due to the
presence in the solutions the following exotic peculiarities:
• non-vanishing global NUT parameter,
• closed time-like curves around those parts of the symmetry axis which are
outside the sources,
• angle deficit (or excess) at the points of the symmetry axis,
• non-zero physical magnetic charges of the sources,
• existence of some additional singularities on or off the axis.
To single out solutions without these physically unacceptable properties,
one needs to impose on the parameters of these solitonic families some constraints which lead to a system of algebraic equations. The problem is that
these algebraic equations (even for the simplest case of two objects) are extremely complicated and it is difficult to resolve them in order to show whether
they have physically appropriate resolution compatible with the existence of a
positive distance between the sources.
The aforementioned nuisances constitute the real troubles only in the general
case of rotating sources. The comprehensive study of the problem in static case
have been presented in [2] where it was constructed the exact analytic static
solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for two charged massive sources separated by the well defined positive distance and free of aforementioned pathologies. We showed that such static equilibrium exists only for the BH-NS system
and it is impossible to have the physical equilibrium state for the pairs BH-BH
or NS-NS. It is worth mentioning that these exact results was in full agreement
with earlier approximate approach [3] and numerical experiments [4].
After these results, the natural question arose whether the analogous physical
equilibrium exists for two rotating sources. It turns out that for the case BHNS the answer is affirmative and we were able to demonstrate [5] the exact
equilibrium solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for two rotating charged
objects one of which is a Black Hole and another one is a Naked Singularity.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to emphasize that in spite of the known nonexistence of physical equilibrium for the systems BH-BH and NS-NS in static
case, we cannot assert the non-existence of physical equilibrium for such systems also for rotating objects. May be the rotations can create the additional
forces which can overcome the ”no go” result for the static states (although, if
so, it seems to be a little bit strange, because such rotating equilibrium states
would have no limit to the case of vanishing rotations). Thus, for the binary systems of rotating BH-BH and NS-NS the question on the possibility of physical
equilibrium at present remains open.

1.2

On the influence of the external electromagnetic fields

Another relevant line of examination the problems of this kind is stability and
existence of the equilibrium states of the binary system of rotating Black Holes
and Naked Singularities immersed in the external electromagnetic fields. The

2

problem here is to construct solutions describing Black Hole or Naked Singularity or binary system containing different combinations of such objects under the
influence of the external fields. Of course, the most interesting cases would be
the exactly solvable models. It is known that all kind of Black Holes and Naked
Singularities and their binary states are solitons. That’s why these states can be
described by exact analytical solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Is it
possible to immerse these objects into external electromagnetic fields but do not
exceed the bounds of exactly solvable models? The answer is affirmative and
the starting crucial point is that such popular external field as Melvin magnetic
universe [6] indeed can be derived in the framework of the inverse scattering
solitonic generating technique, that is this universe appear as Einstein-Maxwell
soliton (”geon” in the John Wheeler terminology which nomen have been used
by M.A. Melvin in his paper) on the flat Minkowski space, however, in the
form of cosmological non-localizable configuration1 . The solitonic nature of the
Melvin magnetic universe have been discovered in 1988 by G.A. Alekseev [8] in
framework of his generalized inverse scattering technique [9] applicable for the
case when Einstein-Maxwell fields can be interpreted as external (extending to
infinity) and not in the form of localized perturbations2 .
The same is true for the Melvin-Harrison universe [10] which generalizes
the Melvin solution by adding an azimuthal twist to the gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Such a twist appear when together with magnetic also an
electric field is present and these fields (although each of which has no azimuthal
components) are, nevertheless, not parallel producing the flux of electromagnetic
energy in azimuthal direction (that is azimuthal component of the Poynting
vector). This, in turn, produce also non-zero time-azimuthal component of the
metric tensor responsible for the rotation of such generalized Melvin geon.
Soon after Melvin’s publication K.S. Thorne [11] in 1965 investigated the
stability of this solution. The results of his analysis he formulated in the following clear statements: ”It is shown that no radial perturbation can cause
the magnetic field to undergo gravitational collapse to a singularity or electromagnetic explosion to infinite dispersion. Rather, when arbitrarily perturbed
inside a finite region, the magnetic and gravitational fields undergo damped,
turbulent oscillation until they have radiated away from the perturbed region
all the energy associated with the perturbation. Then they settle down into
1 It is worth mentioning that this solution have been obtained ten years before M.A. Melvin
in 1954 by W.B. Bonnor [7] [see page 230, expressions (3.13) in his paper] and has been
rediscovered in 1964 by M.A. Melvin.
2 Such solutions are generated by the meromorphic structure of the dressing matrix in the
complex plane of the spectral parameter but they correspond to the poles located at infinity
of this plane. Mathematically such solutions represent solitons (because their definition is
based only on aforementioned meromorphicity property without any additional conditions,
for example as localization or finiteness of energy). Although such definition mathematically
corresponds to the notion of solitons in non-gravitational physics the gravitational solitons in
general have many different traits. For the case of pure gravity these differences have been
outlined in subsection 2.3 of the book [1].
Because of the non-local nature of gravitational solitons corresponding to the pole of dressing
matrix at infinity G.A. Alekseev in his papers preferred called them non-solitonic configurations.

Melvin’s unperturbed, static configuration”. Such conclusion suggests that the
Melvin solution in some finite region of space can have a reasonable physical
application.
The first step in this direction was made in 1974 by R.M. Wald [12] who (on
the base of A. Papapetrou analysis of some properties of Killing vectors in case of
axial symmetry [13]) constructed the exact solution for the test electromagnetic
field in the fixed external gravitational field produced by the Kerr black hole. Far
from black hole the Wald space-time (in the linear approximation with respect
to the electromagnetic potentials) tends to the Melvin magnetic universe.
This field of research have been essentially promoted in 1976 by F.J. Ernst
and W.J. Wild [14] who constructed the exact solution of Einstein-Maxwell
equation describing the Kerr-Newman black hole placed in the Melvin magnetic
universe. This solution have been obtained by different technique with respect
to our inverse scattering method but, of course, our ”solitonic approach” for
this particular case should give the same result.

1.3

Method in general

The Melvin magnetic field configuration can be generalized further and corresponding generalization we can call Melvin Class of solutions of the EinsteinMaxwell equations. As we already mentioned, the general theory and the
method how to construct such non-localazible solutions in the framework of
the inverse scattering technique have been developed by G.A. Alekseev [8, 9].
Then it is possible to construct a set of exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell
equations representing black holes (BH), naked singularities (NS) or their combinations immersed into the Melvin Class external electromagnetic fields.
To do this one need first of all solutions generating technique for the elementary processes (BH)0 → (BH)def ormed + External F ield or (N S)0 →
(N S)def ormed + External F ield where (BH)0 and (N S)0 are initial background
configurations. In general, solutions generating technique permits to solve the
matrix linear eigenvalue problem
∂ϕ (x, w) /∂xµ = Λµ ν (x, w) Uν (x) ϕ (x, w) ,

(1)

the integrability conditions of which coincide with original Einstein-Maxwell
equations. Here the components Λµ ν (x, w) are given (solution independent)
functions of xµ , w and w is a complex spectral parameter independent on the
coordinates xµ . The seed (background) solution for the metric and electromag(0)
netic potentials together with seed matrices Uν and ϕ(0) are known. Then
perturbed matrix ϕ can be found by the dressing procedure ϕ = χϕ(0) solving
the corresponding spectral equation for χ for each type of its analytical structure in w-plane. The standard localized solitonic perturbations correspond to
the meromorphic matrix χ tending to identity at w → ∞ and having the finite
number of poles in the finite region of complex w-plane. The new point is that
Melvin Class of external fields is generated also by meromorphic structure of
dressing matrix χ but with poles at infinity w → ∞. In general this corresponds
4

to the rational function (with respect to the spectral parameter w) analytical
structure of the dressing matrix:
χ=

k=n
X
k=1

Rk (x)
+ A(0) (x) + wA(1) (x) + w2 A(2) (x) + ... + wm A(m) (x) . (2)
w − wk

Here the first sum of simple poles at finite region of the w-plane generates
the set of n localized solitons (the multiple poles localizable solitons also can be
obtained by the poles fusion procedure [1], like it was done for Tomimatsu-Sato
multi-solitonic solution). In stationary case these are a mixture of n interacting
black holes and naked singularities. The multiple pole at infinity generates
external electromagnetic fields into which this mixture is immersed. Up to now
we show in details how to construct exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell
equations for the simplest case of the such dressing matrix (one simple pole in
finite region and one simple pole at infinity):
R1 (x)
+ A(0) (x) + wA(1) (x) .
(3)
w − w1
Depending on the free arbitrary parameters the external fields contain we
have solutions of the three types:
1. Kerr-Newman object placed into external electromagnetic field which has
original Melvin pure magnetic structure at spatial infinity (this is the solution
which has been obtained in [14]).
2. The same but with twisting Melvin-Harrison gravitational and electromagnetic fields at spatial infinity [10].
3. The set of solutions corresponding to the general Melvin Class asymptotics at spatial infinity. Some subset of these solutions have the new exotic
peculiarities outside the symmetry axis (most interesting are ergoregions of the
toroidal structure), see discussion in [8].
Case 3 are new but a number of these solutions need a remedy to be made
free from some unphysical phenomenons. We think that this can be possible by
adding multipole poles at w → ∞.

Einstein-Maxwell equations

The task of the inverse scattering method for the interacting gravitational and
electromagnetic fields is to find a new solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations
if some background (seed) of these equations is given. The method represents
the generalization of the pure gravity inverse scattering technique [15, 16] and
has been developed by G.A. Alekseev in [17] which technique he exposed in
details in [8]. We described Alekseev technique (in slightly different notations)
in chapter ”Einstein-Maxwell fields” of the book [1] and in the present paper
we follow definitions and notations from this book.
The outline of the method is as follows. For the integrable ansatz of the
Einstein–Maxwell equations the metrics is:
ds2 = f η µν dxµ dxν + gab dxa dxb ,
5

(4)

where the Greek indices as well as small Latin indices take only two values. The
metric coefficients f and gab are functions only on two Greek coordinates xµ .
In case of stationary fields with axial symmetry the variables xµ correspond to
the standard pair of cylindrical coordinates (ρ, z) (that is radial distance from
the axis and coordinate along this axis) and Latin variables xa stand for time
and azimuthal angle. In case of non-stationary fields the pair of xµ signify
time and one active spatial coordinate while the variables xa correspond to
the two residual (mute) spatial variables from which the fields do not depend.
Accordingly, the metric components η µν take the form:


−e 0
η µν =
,
(5)
0 1
where e = −1 and e = 1 for the stationary and non-stationary cases, respectively.
From now on we attribute to the small Latin indices numerical values 1, 2
(as for the Greek indices one also can keep in mind some values for them but
nowhere in the paper there is a necessity to use for these indexes any concrete
numerics). With this convention the interval (4) is:
ds2 = f η µν dxµ dxν + g11 dx1

2

+ g22 dx2

2

+ 2g12 dx1 dx2 ,

(6)

The metric coefficients gab are real and symmetric (g21 = g12 ) and for the
2
determinant g11 g22 − g12
we adopt the notation:
2
g11 g22 − g12
= eα2 .

(7)

In order to make the integrable ansatz compatible with the metric of this type
one should assume that only components Aa of the electromagnetic potentials
are non zero and they depend only on Greek coordinates xµ , that is:
Aµ = 0 , Aa,b = 0 , Aa,µ 6= 0.

(8)

Correspondingly, the nonvanishing covariant and contravariant components of
the electromagnetic field tensor are:
Fµa = Aa,µ , F µa = f −1 η µν g ab Ab,ν .

(9)

Here, and in the sequel, η µν and g ab are the metric components inverse to η µν
and gab respectively (that is η µλ η λν = δ µν , g ac gcb = δ ab ) and by comma we denote
the simple partial derivatives.
The Einstein-Maxwell equations for the metric coefficients gab and electromagnetic potentials Aa do not contain the scale factor f and represent the
following closed self-consistent system:
η µν α−1 (αg bc gac,µ ),ν = −4ηµν g bc Aa,µ Ac,ν + 2δ ba η µν g cd Ac,µ Ad,ν ,
η µν (αg ab Ab,µ ),ν = 0 .
6

(10)
(11)

Contracting indices a and b in the first of these equations we get the useful
consequence:
η µν α,µν = 0 .
(12)
If α is some given solution of this equation, the second functionally independent solution we denote by β and it can be found (up to an arbitrary additive
constant) from the relation
β ,µ = −eη µρ ǫρσ α,σ .

(13)

Here and in what follows we use the Euclidean Kroneker symbols in Greek
indices as


0 1
ǫµν = ǫµν =
,
(14)
−1 0
and the same (which we will need later) for the Latin indices:


0 1
ab
ǫ = ǫab =
.
−1 0

(15)

Alongside with Aa we introduce an auxiliary electromagnetic potentials Ba
which play an intermediary role and not manifest itself in the final results, however, which is very helpful for technical side of the inverse scattering machinery.
This are defined by the following differential relation:
Ba,µ = −α−1 η µν ǫνλ gab ǫbc Ac,λ .

(16)

It is easy to verify that the integrability condition for this equation, ǫµν Ba,µν =
0, coincides with the Maxwell equation (11). Relation (16) can also be written
in its inverse form:
Aa,µ = α−1 η µν ǫνλ gab ǫbc Bc,λ .
(17)
Now we combine Aa and Ba into a single complex electromagnetic potential Φa
defined by
Φa = Aa + iBa ,
(18)
then (16)–(17) are, respectively, the imaginary and real parts of the following
equation for Φa :
Φa,µ = −iα−1 η µν ǫνλ gab ǫbc Φc,λ ,
(19)
from which the Maxwell equations for Φa trivially results:
η µν (αg ab Φb,µ ),ν = 0 .

(20)

By the direct calculation one can show that Einstein equations (10) can be
written as
η µν α−1 (αg bc gac,µ ),ν = −2g bc η µν Φ̄a,µ Φc,ν ,

(21)

where (and in what follows) the line over a letter signify complex conjugation.
Due to relation (16) the right hand side of this equation is real and coincides
7

with the right hand side of (10). It is thus clear that any solution gab and
Aa = Re Φa of (18)–(21) is also a solution of the Einstein–Maxwell equations
(10)–(11). Note the auxiliary role played by the potential Ba .
Einstein-Maxwell equations can be represented in more compact form using three-dimensional matrices (we designate them by the bold letters). Let’s
use the capital Latin indexes A, B, ... to enumerate the components of these
matrices. Each such index take values 1, 2, 3 and fuse previously used small
Latin indexes with index 3 which enumerate the third rows and columns of the
three-dimensional matrices.
AB
We note for definiteness that in any matrix components of the types (M) ,
A
B
(M)AB , (M) B or (M)A the first index, independent of its up or down
position, will enumerate the rows, and the second index - columns.
The basic objects for such 3-dimensional representation of the theory are

det G =16 g11 g22 − g12

(25)

η µν (αYG,µ G−1 ),ν = 0

(26)

Now the Einstein-Maxwell equations (20)-(21) together with additional condition (19) acquire the three-dimensional matrix form:

where the matrix Y (with components (Y)A B ) are defined as


1 0 2Φ2
Y =  0 1 −2Φ1 
0 0

(27)

Substitution of (22), (23) and (27) into (26) gives exactly (19)-(21) and
nothing else.
After matrices G and Y become known the metric coefficient f can be found
by quadratures from the following equation:
(ln f ),µ = (ln D),µ − (ln α),µ

The integrability condition for equation (28), ǫ (ln f ),µν = 0, satisfy automatically if the previous equations for the metric coefficients gab and potentials Φa
are satisfied. The complete Einstein-Maxwell system contain also one additional
differential equation of the second order for the metric coefficient f . However, it
is the direct consequence of the relations (28)-(29) and of all previous equations
for gab and Φa , then there is no necessity to pay attention to it.

Construction of solutions

We see that any solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations is encoded in matrix G
which not only satisfy equation (26) but also has special structure (22)-(23) [note
that a solution of equations (26)-(27) in general has no bound to give matrix
G namely in the special form (22)-(23)]. Correspondingly we need to construct
a three-dimensional linear spectral problem the self-consistency conditions of
which provide for both of these properties. This task is resolved by the following
spectral equation for three-dimensional matrix ϕ (with components (ϕ)AB ):
ϕ,µ =

(w + β) δ νµ + eαη µρ ǫρν
i Uν ϕ ,
h
2
2i (w + β) − eα2

(30)

where w is free complex spectral parameter independent on coordinates xµ .
Matrix ϕ is function on all three variables xµ and w, but matrices Uν (with
components (Uν )A B ) depend only on two coordinates xµ and are of the form:
Uν = ieαη νρ ǫρσ G−1 G,σ Y† + 4e(α2 G−1 ),ν Ω ,

(31)

where matrix G and Y have been introduced by expressions (22),(23) and (27).
AB
Matrix Ω (with components (Ω) ) is defined as


0 1 0
Ω =  −1 0 0  .
(32)
0 0 0
Direct calculations show that the integrability conditions for the equation (30)
(that is ϕ,µν = ϕ,νµ ) coincide with equation (26) and, due to the structure
(22),(23) and (27) of matrices G and Y, gives Einstein-Maxwell equations (19)(21).
Then it is clear that any solution for ϕ automatically contains solution for
Einstein-Maxwell equations encoded in matrix G. Now the problem is how to
pull out matrix G from ϕ.
The inverse scattering dressing procedure implies that we need to know
(0)
(0)
some background solution gab , Φa of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for metric
coefficients and electromagnetic potentials from which we can get from (22)(23) the background matrix G(0) as well as its inverse. Then from relation (31)
9

(0)

follows the background matrices Uµ and from differential equation (30) we can
find the background spectral matrix ϕ(0) (the calculation of ϕ(0) is the only point
in the procedure which need a real integration of some differential equations,
all other steps of the method consist either of pure algebraic manipulation or
calculation the quadratures). The dressing procedure for construction a new
solutions from the given background one means that the new spectral matrix ϕ
can be represented as ”dressed” value of its seed solution ϕ(0) , that is:
ϕ = χϕ(0) ,

(33)

where matrix χ (with components (χ)A B ) play a role of relative exact perturbation of the background and depends on all three variables xµ and w. Equation
for matrix χ following from (30) [taking into account that ϕ(0) is a solution of
(30)] is:

(34)
χ,µ =

The analysis shows that due to equations (30),(33),(34) and special structure
(22)-(23) of matrix G we have the following important algebraic relation:
i
† h (0)
G + 4i (w + β) Ω χ−1 ,
(35)
G+4i (w + β) Ω = χ−1
which is satisfied everywhere in the complex plane of parameter w. Here appeared the Hermitian conjugation of the matrix χ−1 (with components χ−1 A B )
which depends on w and the sense of such object need to be explained. The
definition of the Hermitian conjugation of matrix functions depending on the
real coordinates xµ and complex parameter w is the following: to obtain the
Hermitian conjugation M† as a function of xµ and w of any matrix M one
should first calculate the value of the matrix M at the complex conjugate point
w̄, i.e. the value M(xµ , w̄), and then take the usual Hermitian conjugate of this
value.
Namely from equation (35) follows matrix G (and, consequently, metric
and electromagnetic potentials) in terms of the background solution if also the
dressing matrix χ can be found in terms of the background quantities. However,
precisely this miraculous possibility is provided by the inverse scattering method
in case of the meromorphic structure of the dressing matrices χ and χ−1 with
respect to the parameter w. In this way the final expressions for the metric and
electromagnetic potentials can be obtained in exact analytical form.

Alekseev’s extension for the dressing matrix

In the book [1] we considered only the Einstein-Maxwell solitonic solutions when
both dressing matrix χ and its inverse χ−1 have simple poles at the finite points
of the complex plane of the spectral parameter w and also under condition that
all these points are different from each other. Here, following the Alekseev
10

papers [8, 9], we describe the generalization of this technique for the case when
dressing matrices χ and χ−1 both have one simple pole at infinity of the complex
plane of spectral parameter. In this case χ and χ−1 are of the form:
χ = Aw+P , χ−1 = Bw+Q ,

(36)

where matrices A, P, B, Q (with components (A)A B , (P)A B , (B)A B , (Q)A B )
do not depend on the parameter w and matrix P has an inverse P−1 (with
components P−1 A B ).
Complete system where from all matrices can be found are two evident
relations χχ−1 = I, χ−1 χ = I and equations (34), (35). Each of these can be
represented as zero condition for some polynomial (cubic or second order) with
respect to the parameter w. The vanishing conditions for all coefficients of the
second order w-polynomials χχ−1 − I and χ−1 χ − I give matrices B, Q as:
Q = P−1 , B = −P−1 AP−1 ,

(37)

and the special requirement for matrix A:
AP−1 A = 0 .

(38)

Then from (34) and (35) first of all follows two additional demands for the
matrix A:
A,µ = 0 ,
(39)
A† ΩA = 0
and basic expressions for matrices G and Uµ :

The six equations (38)-(40) and (43)-(45) represent the complete self-consistent
system from which matrices A and P can be found in terms of the background
(0)
matrices G(0) , Uµ and given (chosen from the outset) functions α, β. Remarkably enough this system can be resolved exactly [8] and it has a unique solution
up to the three arbitrary real constants, which represent free parameters of the
11

dressed solution generated by the pole at infinity of the w-plane. After we obtain in this way matrix P the resulting solutions of interest for G and Uµ follow
from equations (41) and (42). The results show that A is the degenerate matrix

By the direct calculations it is easy to show that integrability conditions of
equations (53) and (56) for functions κ−1 and Q are guaranteed by the fact
that matrices Uµ defined by formula (31) automatically satisfied the identity
ǫµν Uµ,ν = 0 if Einstein-Maxwell equations (26) are satisfied. This is indeed
(0)
the case for the background matrices Uµ entering the right hand sides of (53)
and (56) since all background quantities represent a solution of the EinsteinMaxwell equations by definition. Because all other terms in the right hand sides
of (53) and (56) are constants the integrability conditions of these equations are
satisfied evidently.
Not so simple are circumstances about integrability of the equation (58) for
function R. To prove this integrability we need to show that quantity ǫµν R,µν
vanish. Substituting into this expression the derivative over xν of the right hand
side of the (58) and eliminating from the result derivatives of the functions κ−1
and κ̄−1 using equation (54), one can show by the direct calculation that ǫµν R,µν
indeed is zero.

With these results we have from (22) and (27) matrices G and Y after
which we can calculate matrices Kµ from (29) and take quadrature for metric
coefficient f from equation (28). These calculations are straightforward but
lengthy. The final result, however, is very simple:
f = c0 (κκ̄)−1 f (0) ,

(64)

where c0 is an arbitrary real constant and f (0) represents the background solution for the metric coefficient f .

6

Case of the flat background

Let’s consider the simplest case for the background solution, that is the flat
space without electromagnetic field. For the background metric we have:
2

2
2
(0)
(0)
(65)
ds(0) = f (0) η µν dxµ dxν + g11 dx1 + g22 dx2 ,
where η µν is the same as in (5) and metric coefficients are:
(0)

(0)

g11 = e , g22 = α2 , f (0) = −c1 eD ,

(66)

where α is some solution of the equation (12), c1 is an arbitrary real constant
and D has been defined by the formula (29). The background electromagnetic
potentials are absent3 :
Φ(0)
(67)
a = 0.
3 The fact that (65)-(67) represent the solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations for the flat
space-time can be seen easily if we pass from the coordinates xµ to the pair of coordinates α
and β. Using definition (13) for function β we can derive the identity:

−edα2 + dβ 2 = −eDη µν dxµ dxν .
Due to this relation metric (65)-(66) can be written in the form:

2
2
ds2 = c1 −edα2 + dβ 2 + e dx1 + α2 dx2
,
which is evidently flat. Using matrices G(0) and Y(0) from (68) it is easy to calculate matrices
(0)
Kµ from (29) and substitute them into the equation (28) to check that this equation for
coefficient f (0) is automatically satisfied.

14

First of all we need the background matrices
from formulas (22), (27), (31) respectively:




G(0) =  0

(68)
Although the flat background spectral matrix ϕ(0) (xµ , w) satisfying equation
(0)
(30) with Uµ from (68) we need not in this section, it would be reasonable to
show it since we will need it later. This matrix has the following structure:

0 1
0
0 1
(69)
where function v is defined by the relation:
2

v 2 = (w + β) − eα2 .

(70)

The second step is to calculate functions κ, Q, R from equations (52), (53),
(56), (58), in the right hand side of which we should use the background values
(68) for the corresponding matrices. All three quadratures can be taking easily
and gives the following explicit expressions:
κ−1 = 4k12 α2 + 4ek22 + 1 + i(c2 − 8k1 k2 β) ,

(71)

Q = −8ik1 k3 β + c3 + ic4 ,

(72)

R = −16k1 c2 β +

64k12 k2 β 2

+ c5 ,

(73)

where c2 , c3 , c4 , c5 are new arbitrary real constants. The potentials Φa follow
(0)
from equations (62) and (63) under condition Φa = 0:
Φ1 =

taking into account that k3 = cos γ + i sin γ, we obtain the following expressions
for the electromagnetic potentials:

Melvin magnetic universe as Einstein-Maxwell
soliton

From the previous section it easy to show that the well known Melvin magnetic
universe represents nothing else but solitonic configuration corresponding to the
pole at infinity of the complex plane of the spectral parameter. To see this it
is necessary to take the following particular case of the general solution derived
in the previous section. First of all we choose the stationary case, that is
e = −1 .
Then we leave k1 to be an arbitrary constant and designate it as
constants k2 and γ we put to zero:
k1 =

1
B0 , k2 = 0, γ = 0 (that is k3 = 1) .
4
16

(86)

but

(87)

Also we eliminate arbitrary constant parameters c2 − c5 :
c2 = c3 = c4 = c5 = 0 .

(88)

The coordinates x1 and x2 we can understand as time t and azimuthal angle ϕ
of cylindrical coordinate system and for the stationary case (e = −1) we always
can choose functions α and β [which are solutions of equations (12)-(13)] to
be the radial cylindrical coordinate (α = ρ) and coordinate along the axis of
symmetry (β = −z):
(α, β, x1 , x2 ) = (ρ, −z, t, ϕ)
(89)
(minus in front of z we choose only for technical convenience, as can be seen
from (13) this choice corresponds to the following definition of the 2-dimensional
greek antisymmetric symbol ǫµν : ǫρz = 1, ǫzρ = −1). With such choice of
arbitrary constants and coordinates designation the functions κ, Q, R following
from (71)-(73) are:
1
κ−1 = 1 + B02 ρ2 , Q = 2iB0 z, R = 0 .
4

(90)

As for the arbitrary constants c0 and c1 in (81) we can take them to be unities
without loss of generality:
c0 = c1 = 1 .
(91)
The factor D in (81) under the choice α = ρ also becomes unity:
D=1.
Now the metric follows from (78)-(82):
1
1
ds2 = (1 + B02 ρ2 )2 (dρ2 + dz 2 − dt2 ) + (1 + B02 ρ2 )−2 ρ2 dϕ2 ,

(92)

and electromagnetic potentials from (76)-(77):
At = 0, Aϕ = −

1
2
(1 + B02 ρ2 )−1 .

4

(93)

The only non-vanishing component of the electromagnetic tensor is:
1
Fρϕ = −Fϕρ = B0 ρ(1 + B02 ρ2 )−2 .

(94)

Complex electromagnetic potential (18) for the Melvin solution follows from
(74) and (90):
Φt = −iB0 z , Φϕ = −

1
2
(1 + B02 ρ2 )−1 .

The limit B0 → 0 gives (after adding to the potential Aϕ an appropriate calibration constant) flat space-time without electromagnetic field.

Black hole immersed into Melvin universe

Using the generating technique outlined in the subsection 1.2 (and in the subsection 3.3.4 of the book [1]) it is straightforward to immerse a generalized black
hole (with rotation, electric charge, magnetic charge and NUT parameter) into
the Melvin magnetic universe. Technically this can be done in three different
way. The first one is to add to the flat Minkowski space-time, choosing it as
background, two solitons one of which corresponds to the pole in the finite region of the w-complex plane and other is located at infinity of this plane. Such
approach would corresponds to the dressing matrix we mentioned in Introduction by the formula (3). Second way would be to choose as background the well
known exact solution for generalized black hole and introduce on it the solitonic
perturbation with pole at infinity of the w-plane. The third possibility is to
choose for the background the Melvin magnetic geon derived in the previous
section and add to this background one soliton corresponding to the finite pole
in the complex plane of spectral parameter. Each way has its technical advantages and complications. Let’s choose the third approach which on our opinion
is more straightforward.
So then we consider the Melvin solution (92)-(93) as new background and all
quantities corresponding this solution we designate now by index ”M” (in order
to distinguish them from flat background quantities for which we used before
the index ”0”). Then we have

and we should keep in mind the choosed numerics for the mute Latin coordinates

First of all we need the Melvin background spectral matrix ϕ(M) (ρ, z, w)
which is appropriately normalized solution of equation (30) applied to the
Melvin metric and electromagnetic potentials (96)-(99). In general to integrate
equation (30) is not a simple task. Fortunately in our present problem this
matrix is already known. As follows from (33) and (36)-(37) it is

Formulas (108)-(109) for the background spectral matrix are most fundamental because all the rest is just algebraic manipulations.

the point w = w1 and lA are three arbitrary complex constants. In constants lA
and w1 are encoded all arbitrary parameters of the black hole we immersed in
the Melvin universe. In fact the final metric and electromagnetic potentials does
not depend separately on the constant l1 , they depend only on the ratios l2 /l1
and l3 /l1 . These two arbitrary complex ratios together with pole parameter
w1 generate six real parameters of black hole: mass and NUT parameter (ratio
l2 /l1 ), electric and magnetic charge (ratio l3 /l1 ), angular momentum (Im w1 )
and position of the black hole on the symmetry axis (Re w1 ).
Final solution for the metric and electromagnetic potentials, that is for the
matrix G (22), can be expressed in terms of the matrix S (with components
(S)A B ) (see subsection 3.3.3 in the book [1]):

where c0 is an arbitrary real constant and f (M) is the Melvin background value
of this factor defined in the formula (97).
There is no big sense to express this final solution in closed analytical form
in terms of elementary functions on coordinates ρ, z, (although this is possible, of course) because such form is too cumbersome. It is more convenient to
20

investigate each particular case of interest starting from the corresponding particular form of Melvin spectral matrix (108)-(109) and derive all the rest from
(110)-(116) keeping calculations strictly in framework of this particular case.
There is further more practical development and applications of the theory
presented here but it is still under progress and we hope to expose it later.
