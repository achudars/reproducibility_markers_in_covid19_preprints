Abstract
Large intelligent surfaces (LISs) have been recently proposed as an effective wireless communication
solution that can leverage antenna arrays deployed on the entirety of man-made structures such as walls.
An LIS can provide space-intensive and reliable communication, enabling the desired wireless channel to
exhibit a perfect line-of-sight. However, the outage probability of LIS, which is an important performance
metric to evaluate the system reliability, remains uncharacterized. In this paper, the distribution of uplink
sum-rate is asymptotically analyzed for an LIS system. Given the derived asymptotic distribution, the
outage probability is derived for the considered LIS system. Simulation results show that the results of
the proposed asymptotic analyses are in close agreement to the exact mutual information in the presence
of a large number of antennas and devices.

and drones [1], [2]. To support this demand for wireless connectivity for IoT services without
additional radio resources, the concept of large intelligent surfaces (LISs) has been newly
proposed to exploit the fact that man-made structures, such as buildings and walls, can be
made electromagnetically active and used for wireless transmission [3]–[7]. An LIS system
enables the desired channels to become line-of-sight (LOS) channels, resulting in more reliable
and space-intensive communications compared to conventional massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) systems.1 Effectively using LISs requires addressing many challenges such
as obtaining their achievable rate, evaluating the system reliability, and analyzing the channel
hardening effect.
Prior art [3]–[7] has studied some of these challenges. In particular, the work in [3] studied
uplink data rate of the matched filter (MF) and derived the performance of the optimal receiver
in an LIS system. In [4] and [5], the authors analyzed the uplink data rates to evaluate LIS performance while considering, respectively, hardware impairments and channel estimation errors.
Moreover, the work in [5] verified the occurrence of the channel hardening effect theoretically.
Meanwhile, the authors in [7] and [6] proposed the use of LIS as a reconfigurable scatterer that
reflects transmitted signals and developed LIS phase shifter that maximize energy efficiency and
received signal strength, respectively. However, these recent works [3]–[7] have not investigated
the distribution of the actual data rate which is necessary to analyze the outage probability of
an LIS. Since an accurate estimation of the outage probability enables us to operate an LIS
network reliably, it is necessary to analyze this outage probability in an LIS system serving a
large number of devices.
The main contribution of this paper is to derive an exact closed-form expression for the outage
probability and verify the reliability of an LIS system in terms of the outage probability.2 Given an
LIS area serving multiple devices, we analyze the asymptotic distribution of the sum-rate, relying
on the Lyapunov central limit theorem (CLT) in the presence of a large number of antennas and
devices. This approximation allows for accurate estimations of the outage probability without
the need for a large number of simulations, and it enables us to verify the reliability of an LIS
system. Simulation results show that an LIS can provide reliable communication regardless of

signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) given that the outage probability keeps constant for varying SNR
when the LIS is equipped with a large number of antennas and devices.
II. S YSTEM M ODEL
Consider an uplink LIS system in which a large number of IoT devices are connected to
the LIS’s large array and a two-dimensional LIS is deployed on the horizontal plane. The LIS
consists of K LIS units, each of which occupies a subarea of the entire LIS and has a square
shape with limited area of 2L × 2L serving a single-antenna device. We assume that the LIS has
its own signal processing unit for estimating channel and detecting any data signal, as in [3]–[5].
A large number of antennas, M, are deployed on the surface of the LIS unit in rectangular lattice
form with ∆L spacing, centered on the (x, y) coordinates of the corresponding device. Given that
LIS
the location of device k is (xk , yk , zk ), antenna m of LIS unit k is placed at (xLIS
km , ykm , 0) where
LIS
xLIS
km ∈ [xk − L, xk + L] and ykm ∈ [yk − L, yk + L]. The LIS units may overlap depending on

the location of their corresponding devices and this results in severe performance degradation.
To prevent this problem, we assume that the devices with partially overlapping LIS units are
allocated on orthogonal resources, resulting in an LIS composed of K non-overlapping LIS units.
Moreover, we assume that each device controls its uplink transmit power toward the center of
its LIS unit according to a target SNR.
A. Wireless Channel Model
Note that the entire LIS environment is active during wireless communication and the signal
from the NLOS path can be negligible compared to the LOS signal, as proved in [5]. Hence,
we consider the LIS channel hkk ∈ CM between device k and LIS unit k as a LOS path defined

In [5], the mean and variance of the individual rate in an uplink LIS system is asymptotically
derived. However, the distribution of the sum-rate must be analyzed in order to obtain the outage
probability and evaluate the system reliability. Deriving this distribution is not trivial and cannot
be obtained directly from [5], because a sequence of individual rates, [R1 , · · · , RK ], is not
identically distributed. We begin with a characteristic of LIS systems in which
Sk /M 2 − p̄k /M 2 −−−−→ 0,
M →∞

Ik /M 2 − µ̄Ik /M 2 −−−−−→ 0,
M,K→∞

where p̄k =

M 2 p2k
16π 2 L4

, pk = tan−1 (L2 /(zk

p

2L2 + zk2 )), and µ̄Ik is a deterministic value depending

on the correlation matrices and the locations of the devices [5, Lemma 4]. Then, the asymptotic
rate, R̄k , is obtained by the following lemma.
Lemma 1. The asymptotic rate, R̄k , can be obtained by the function of a random variable Ik
as R̄k = ak − bk Ik , where ak =

ρk p̄k (1−τk2 )
ρk p̄k (1−τk2 )+µ̄Ik

+ log(1 +

ρk p̄k (1−τk2 )
)
µ̄Ik

and bk =

ρk p̄k (1−τk2 )/µ̄Ik
ρk p̄k (1−τk2 )+µ̄Ik

.

Proof: The detailed proof is presented in Appendix A.
Given that p̄k and µ̄Ik are deterministic values, ak and bk are also deterministic values. Then,
Lemma 1 shows that the distribution of R̄k is exclusively determined by that of Ik , and it allows
P
us to readily obtain the distribution of R̄ = k R̄k by analyzing Ik instead of R̄k itself. From
P
P
Lemma 1, we have R̄ = k ak − bk Ik and the second term k bk Ik determines the distribution
P
of R̄. By using the Lyapunov CLT [9], we analyze the distribution of k bk Ik and finally obtain
the distribution of R, as follows.

Theorem 1. For large M and K, R approximately follows R ∼ N (µ̄R , σ̄R2 ), where µ̄R =

ergodic rate, reliability, and scheduling diversity, without extensive simulations. Then, we can
characterize the closed-form expression for the outage probability, defined as the probability
when the instantaneous sum-rate falls below a certain threshold value.
Corollary 1. For large M and K, the outage probability of event {R < RD } is approximately
obtained as follows:
Po = Pr [R < RD ] = 1 − Q

RD − µ̄R 
,
σ̄R

where RD is a desired rate when the probability of the outage event is Po , and Q(·) is a Gaussian
Q-function.

Assume that RD = δ· µ̄R for 0 < δ ≤ 1, then we have Po = Q (1−δ) µ̄σ̄RR . As M increases, µ̄R

increases and converges to its bound, and σ̄R decreases, as proved in [5]. Therefore P̄o decreases
as M increases. On the basis of scaling law for K, µ̄R and σ̄R follow O(K log(1 + K1 )) = O(1)
√
and O( √1K ), respectively. Then, µ̄σ̄RR increases with O( K) and finally P̄o also decreases, as
K increases. Therefore, an LIS can provide reliable communication in the presence of a large
number of antennas and devices. Moreover, since µ̄R and σ̄R are deterministic values obtained
from the correlation matrices and the locations of the devices, we can estimate the outage
probability of LIS without the need for extensive simulations.

AND

A NALYSIS

In this section, all simulations are statistically averaged over a large number of independent
runs. For our simulations, we assume that target SNR is 3 dB, λ = 0.1 m, L = 0.25 m, τk2 = 0.5,
and βPL = 3.7, and the probability of LOS path and Rician factor are applied based on the 3GPP
model [5]. We consider a scenario in which devices are located on a two-dimensional xy-plane
at z = 1 in parallel to the LIS within the range of −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 4 (in meters) and
the distance between the adjacent devices is equally set to dm . Therefore, a total of 81, 25, and 9
devices are located in a two-dimensional rectangular lattice form when dm = 2L, dm = 4L, and
dm = 8L, respectively. For a massive MIMO system, we assume a single BS with M antennas
serving K users based on a uniform linear array, as in [5].
Fig. 1 shows the probability density function (PDF) of the instantaneous rate according to the
independent channel realizations. As proved in Theorem 1, the PDF of the sum-rate follows a
Gaussian distribution and the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation improves as M and K
increase. As can be seen, the two PDFs are almost aligned with each other, and the approximation
error is negligible when M = 400 and dm = 2L, corroborating the result of Theorem 1.

from Corollary 1 as a function of the target SNR and M, respectively. We assume that RD = µ̄R
when the target SNR is 0 dB in Fig. 2 and δ = 0.98 in Fig. 3. In both figures, the asymptotic
results from Corollary 1 become close to the results of our simulations as M increases, verifying
the accuracy of our analyses. As shown in Fig. 2, even when M = 100, the performance gap
between the results of the asymptotic estimation and the simulation is less than 0.2 dB in terms
of the target SNR. Moreover, since the noise component of an LIS system becomes negligible
as M increases [5], we can observe that the target SNR gradually lessens its effect on the
outage probability as M increases (e.g., when the target SNR is 2 dB, the outage probabilities
for M = 100 and 1600 are 3 · 10−3 and 10−1 , respectively). Furthermore, Fig. 3 shows that
the outage probability decreases and eventually reaches zero as M and K increase. In addition,
the outage probabilities resulting from LIS are always lower than those resulting from massive
MIMO system over the entire range of M, which shows that an LIS system can be more reliable
than massive MIMO.
Fig. 4 shows the impact of the surface-area of each LIS unit on the outage probability with
a fixed total allocated area of an LIS (e.g., A = 16 [m2 ]). Given a fixed A, K increases as L
decreases and, hence, Po decreases, as shown in Fig. 4.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have analyzed the sum-rate of an uplink LIS system asymptotically, under
practical LIS environments. In particular, we have derived the distribution of the sum-rate by
considering a practical LIS environment in which the interference can be generated by devicespecific Rician fading with spatial correlation in presence of imperfect channel estimation.
Moreover, we have studied the outage probability of the sum-rate from the derived asymptotic
distribution. We have shown that the asymptotic results can accurately and analytically determine
the performance of an LIS, including the distribution of the sum-rate and outage probability,
without the need for a large number of simulations. Simulation results have verified the results
of the asymptotic analyses. These numerical results have shown that the analytic results were
in close agreement with the results arising from extensive simulations, and an LIS can provide
reliable communication in terms of the outage probability.

Then, the numerator and denominator of the upper bound of (3) decrease with O( K 3M
10 ) and

O( K 2 M
10 ), respectively, as M, K → ∞. Therefore, the upper bound of (3) decreases with
P
O( K1 ) and eventually reaches zero as K → ∞. In conclusion, (2) is satisfied and
k bk Ik

approximately follows a Gaussian distribution. Given that bk Ik is a random variable independent

across k, we can ultimately obtain the distribution of k bk Ik for large M and K, as follows:
