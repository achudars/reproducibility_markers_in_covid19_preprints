Abstract. We prove that for a stratiﬁable scattered space X of ﬁnite scattered height, the function
space Ck (X) endowed with the compact-open topology is Baire if and only if X has the Moving Oﬀ
Property of Gruenhage and Ma. As a byproduct of the proof we establish many interesting Baire
category properties of the function spaces Ck′ (X, Y ) = {f ∈ Ck (X, Y ) : f (X ′ ) ⊂ {∗Y }}, where X is
a topological space, X ′ is the set of non-isolated points of X, and Y is a topological space with a
distinguished point ∗Y .

1. Introduction and Main Results
This paper was motivated by the problem of characterization of scattered topological spaces X
whose function space Ck (X) is Baire. Here Ck (X) is the space of real-valued continuous functions on
X, endowed with the compact-open topology.
T A topological space X is Baire if for any sequence (Un )n∈ω of open dense sets in X, the intersection
n∈ω Un is dense in X. In [17] Gruenhage and Ma made a conjecture that for a Tychonoff space X,
the function space Ck (X) is Baire if and only if X has the Moving Off Property (abbreviated MOP),
which is defined as follows.
A family F of subsets of a topological space X is called
• discrete if each point x ∈ X has a neighborhood Ox ⊂ X that meets at most one set of the
family F;

• strongly discrete if each set F ∈ F has an open neighborhood OF ⊂ X such that the indexed
family {OF }F ∈F is discrete in the sense that each point x ∈ X has a neighborhood Ox ⊂ X
that meets at most one set OF , F ∈ F;
• a moving off family if for any compact set K ⊂ X there exists a non-empty set F ∈ F such
that K ∩ F = ∅.
A topological space X is defined to have the Moving Off Property (abbreviated MOP) if each
moving off family F of compact sets in X contains an infinite strongly discrete subfamily D ⊂ F.
In Theorem 2.1 of [17] Gruenhage and Ma observed that a Tychonoff space X has MOP if its
function space Ck (X) is Baire, and made the following conjecture (see also [18, Question 4.7]).
Conjecture 1.1. A Tychonoff space X has MOP if and only if its function space Ck (X) is Baire.
In [17] this conjecture was confirmed for all q-spaces, i.e., spaces whose
Q any point x ∈ X admits a
sequence (Un )n∈ω of neighborhoods such that each sequence (xn )n∈ω ∈ n∈ω Un has an accumulation
point in X. The class of q-spaces includes all locally compact and all first-countable spaces. In
[15] Conjecture 1.1 has been confirmed for subspaces of linearly ordered spaces. More extensive
information on MOP can be found in the Ph.D. dissertation of Hughes [21]. Some set-theoretical
questions related to MOP were studied by Tall in [31].
In this paper we confirm Conjecture 1.1 for stratifiable scattered spaces of finite scattered height.
Let us recall that a topological space X is scattered if each non-empty subspace of X contains an
isolated point. A point x of a topological space X is called isolated if its singleton {x} is clopen in
X. A subset of a topological space is clopen if it is both closed and open. For a topological space X
by Ẋ we denote the set of isolated points in X.
The complexity of a scattered space X can be measured by an ordinal number ~(X), called the
scattered height of X. It is defined as follows.
For a subspace A ⊂ X of X denote by A′ := A\ Ȧ the set of non-isolated points of A. Let X [0] = X
and for any ordinal α > 0 define the α-th derived set X [α] of X by the recursive formula
\
X [α] =
(X [β] )′ .
β<α

The smallest ordinal α with X [α] = X [α+1] is called the scattered height of X and is denoted by ~[X].
Observe that a topological space X is scattered if and only if X [~[X]] = ∅.
A regular topological space X is called stratifiable if to each point x ∈ X it is possible to assign
a decreasing sequence (Un (x))n∈ω of neighborhoods such that each closed set F is equal to the
S
T
intersection n∈ω Un [F ] where Un [F ] = x∈F Un (x). The class of stratifiable spaces includes all
metrizable spaces and has many nice properties, see [16, §5]. In Theorem 13.2 we shall prove that
a scattered space X of finite scattered height is stratifiable if and only if for every n < ~[X] the set
X [n] is a retract of X and X [n] is a Gδ -set in X.
One of the principal results of this paper is the following theorem.
Theorem 1.2. For a stratifiable space X, the function space Ck (X) is Baire if and only if X has
MOP and the function space Ck (X ′ ) is Baire.
Applying this theorem by induction, we get the following corollary.
Corollary 1.3. For a stratifiable space X, the space Ck (X) is Baire if and only if X has MOP and
for some n ∈ ω the function space Ck (X [n] ) is Baire.
In its turn, Corollary 1.3 implies
Corollary 1.4. For a stratifiable scattered space X of finite scattered height, the space Ck (X) is
Baire if and only if X has MOP.

Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.3 will be proved in Section 15 after extensive preliminary work made
in Sections 2–14. Namely, in Section 2 we introduce a discrete version of MOP, called DMOP and
prove a game characterization of DMOP, resembling the game characterization of MOP, found by
Gruenhage and Ma in [17] (our game GKF (X) resembles also the games Γ1 (X) and Γ2 (X), studied
by McCoy and Ntantu [25, §8]). In Section 4 we apply the game characterization of DMOP to prove
that a topological space X has DMOP if and only if for any Polish space Y with a distinguished point
∗Y the function space

Ck′ (X, Y ) = f ∈ Ck (X, Y ) : f (X ′ ) ⊂ {∗Y }

is Baire. In Section 5, we study a “winning” modification of DMOP, called WDMOP and prove that
a topological space X has WDMOP if and only if for any pointed Polish space (Y, ∗Y ) the function
space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Choquet. In Sections 7 and 8 we characterize topological spaces X, Y for which the
function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is metrizable or complete-metrizable. In Section 9 we characterize topological
spaces X for which the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has a countable network for any second-countable
pointed space Y . As an application of the mentioned characterizations of Baire category properties of
function spaces Ck′ (X, Y ), in Section 11 we prove the following dichotomy: if for a topological space
X and a pointed Polish space Y the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is analytic, then it is either Polish or
meager (more precisely, ∞-meager). Also we prove that for a regular pointed space Y the function
space Ck′ (X, Y ) is analytic if and only if it is cosmic and the function space Cp′ (X, Y ) is analytic.
The equivalence of meager and ∞-meager properties in the function spaces Ck′ (X, Y ) is established
in Section 10. In Section 12 we observe that for any topological space X and pointed topological
space Y , the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) admits a continuous bijective map onto the function space
Ck′ (X/X ′ , Y ) defined on the quotient space X/X ′ having a unique non-isolated point, and give conditions under which this bijective map Ck′ (X, Y ) → Ck (X/X ′ , Y ) is (or is not) is a homeomorphism.
In Section 13 we prove that a scattered space X of finite scattered height is stratifiable if and only
if for every k < ~[X] the set X [k] is a Gδ -retract in X. In Section 14 we study function spaces with
values in rectifiable spaces Y and prove that if X ′ is a retract of X, then the function space Ck (X, Y )
is homeomorphic to Ck (X ′ , Y ) × Ck′ (X, Y ). In the final section 15 we return back to studying the
function spaces Ck (X, Y ) over stratifiable scattered spaces with values in rectifiable spaces and using
the game characterization of DMOP, prove a more general version of Theorem 1.2 announced in the
introduction. It should be mentioned that the results on Baire category properties of the function
spaces Ck′ (X, Y ) obtained in this paper are essentially used in our forthcoming paper [32], devoted to
studying the function spaces C↓F (X, Y ) endowed with the Fell hypograph topology.
The characterization theorems proved in Sections 4–10 can be unified in the following
Theorem 1.5. Let Y be a pointed metrizable space containing more than one point and X be a
topological space containing an isolated point.
If X does not have DMOP, then Ck′ (X, Y ) is meager and ∞-meager.
If X has DMOP and Y is Choquet, then the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Baire.
Ck′ (X, Y ) is Choquet if and only if Y is Choquet and X has WDMOP.
Ck′ (X, Y ) is complete-metrizable if and only if Y is complete-metrizable and X is a κ̇-space.
Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost complete-metrizable if and only if Y is Choquet and X is a κ̇-space.
Ck′ (X, Y ) is Polish if and only if Y is Polish and X is a κ̇-space with countable set Ẋ of
isolated points.
(7) Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost Polish if and only if Y is almost Polish and X is a κ̇-space with countable
set Ẋ.
(8) Ck′ (X, Y ) is metrizable if and only if X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space.
(9) Ck′ (X, Y ) is metrizable and separable if and only if Y is separable and X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space
with countable set Ẋ.

(10) Ck′ (X, Y ) has a countable network if and only if Y is separable and X has a countable κ̇network.
The statements (1)–(10) of this theorem are proved in Theorems 10.2, 4.4, 5.3, 8.1, 8.4, 8.2, 8.5,
7.4, 7.9, 9.4, respectively. All undefined notions appearing in Theorem 1.5 can be found in the
corresponding sections.
2. The discrete moving off property
In this section we discuss the discrete modification of MOP, called DMOP.
Definition 2.1. A topological space X has the discrete moving off property (briefly, DMOP) if any
moving off family F of finite subsets of Ẋ contains an infinite subfamily D ⊂ F, which is discrete in
X.
We recall that Ẋ denotes the set of all isolated points in X, i.e. points x ∈ X whose singleton {x}
is clopen in X.
It is clear that each space with MOP has DMOP.
Definition 2.2. A topological space X is defined to have the property of discrete diagonalization if
for any sequence F0Q
, F1 , F2 , . . . of infinite discrete families Fn of finite subsets of Ẋ there exists a
sequence (Fn )n∈ω ∈ n∈ω Fn such that the indexed family {Fn }n∈ω is discrete in X.

Lemma 2.3. Each topological space X with DMOP has the property of discrete diagonalization.

Proof. Assume that X has DMOP and let (Fn )n∈ω be a sequence of infinite discrete families of finite
subsets of Ẋ. Fix a countable subfamily {Dn }n∈ω ⊂ F0 consisting of pairwise disjoint non-empty
finite sets Dn in Ẋ. For every n ∈ N let
n
Y

Fi .
En = Dn ∪ F1 ∪ · · · ∪ Fn : (Fi )ni=1 ∈
i=1

S∞

It is easy to see that E := n=1 En is a moving off collection of non-empty finite subsets of Ẋ.
By DMOP, there exists an infinite discrete subfamily {Ek }k∈ω ⊂ E consisting of pairwise disjoint
sets Ek , k ∈ ω. For every k ∈ ω find a number n(k) ∈ N with Ek ∈ En(k) and observe that the
correspondence k 7→ n(k) is injective (as the sets Ek are pairwise disjoint). Replacing (Ek )k∈ω by a
suitable subsequence, we can assume that the sequence (n(k))k∈ω is increasing and hence n(k) ≥ k for
all k ∈ ω. Then for any k ∈ ω there exists a set Fk ∈ Fk such that Fk ⊂ Ek ∈ En(k) . The discreteness
of the family {Ek }k∈ω implies that discreteness of the family {Fk }k∈ω .

Now we are going to present a game characterization of DMOP with help of the game GKF (X),
played by two players, K and F on a topological space X. The player K starts the game. At the n-th
inning the player K chooses a compact subset Kn ⊂ X and player F responds by choosing a finite
subset Fn of Ẋ such that Fn ∩ Kn = ∅. At the end of the game, the player K is declared the winner
if the family {Fn }n∈N is discrete in X; otherwise the player F wins the game.
For a topological space X by F(X) and K(X) we denote the families of finite and compact subsets
of X, respectively.
S
For set A by A<ω we denote the family n∈ω An of all finite sequences (a0 , . . . , an−1 ) of elements
of A. The set A<ω is a tree with respect to the partial order ≤ defined by (a0 , . . . , an ) ≤ (b0 , . . . , bm )
iff n ≤ m and ai = bi for i ≤ n. For a sequence s = (a0 , . . . , am−1 ) and a number n ≤ m let
s↾n := (a0 , . . . , an−1 ) be the initial segment of s of length n.
The following theorem is just a suitable modification of the game characterization of MOP, proved
by Gruenhage and Ma in [17, Theorem 2.3].

Theorem 2.4. A topological space X has DMOP if and only if the player F has no winning strategy
in the game GKF (X).
Proof. If X does not have DMOP, then there exists a moving off family F of finite sets in Ẋ containing
no infinite discrete subfamily. Then the player F can win the game GKF (X) by always choosing distinct
members of F.
Now assume that X has DMOP and let SF : K(X)<ω → F(Ẋ) be any strategy of the player F in the
game GKF (X). The strategy SF is a function assigning to each finite sequence (K1 , . . . , Kn ) ∈ K(X)<ω
a finite set SF (K1 , . . . , Kn ) ⊂ Ẋ that is disjoint with the compact set Kn . Since the player K starts
the game, we can assume that SF assigns to the unique sequence K(X)0 of length zero the empty
subset of Ẋ.
We shall inductively construct a countable subtree T ⊂ K(X)<ω such that for any sequence
(K1 , . . . , Kn ) ∈ T the family {SF (K1 , . . . , Kn , K) : (K
S1 , . . . , Kn , K) ∈ T } is infinite and discrete.
The tree T will be constructed as the union T = n∈ω Tn of trees Tn of height n. To start
the inductive
we put T0 := K(X)0 = {∅}. Assume that for some n ∈ ω the subS construction,
tree Tn ⊂ k≤n K(X)k has been defined. For any node (K1 , . . . , Kn ) ∈ Tn , consider the family
{SF (K1 , . . . , Kn , K) : K ∈ K(X)} and observe that it is moving off. Since X has DMOP, this
family contains an infinite discrete subfamily {SF (K1 , . . . , K, K) : K ∈ Tn+1 (K1 , . . . , Kn )} for some
countable infinite subset Tn+1 (K1 , . . . , Kn ) ⊂ K(X). Finally, put
[
{(K1 , . . . , Kn , K) : K ∈ Tn+1 (K1 , . . . , Kn )}.
Tn+1 = Tn ∪
(K1 ,...,Kn )∈Tn

S
It is clear that the countable tree T = n∈ω Tn has the required property: for every sequence
(K1 , . . . , Kn ) ∈ T the indexed family {SF (K1 , . . . , Kn , K) : (K1 , . . . , Kn , K) ∈ T } is infinite and
discrete.
By Lemma 2.3, the space X has the discrete diagonalization property. So to each sequence
(K1 , . . . , Kn ) ∈ T we can assign a compact set Kn+1 = κ(K1 , . . . , Kn ) such that (K1 , . . . , Kn+1 ) ∈ T
and the indexed family
D = {SF (K1 , . . . , Kn , κ(K1 , . . . , Kn )) : (K1 , . . . , Kn ) ∈ T }
is discrete. Now consider the sequence (Kn )n∈ω ∈ K(X)ω defined recursively as K1 = κ(∅) and
Kn+1 = κ(K1 , . . . , Kn ) for n ∈ N. Also put Fn = SF (K1 , . . . , Kn ) for every n ∈ N. Observe that the
indexed family {Fn }n∈N is discrete, being a subfamily of the discrete family D. Now we see that the
sequence
K1 , F1 , K2 , F2 , K3 , F3 , . . .
is a sequence of moves of the players K, F in which the player F plays according to the strategy SF .
Since the family {Fn }n∈N is discrete, the player K wins, which means that the strategy SF of the
player F is not winning.

Definition 2.5. A topological space X is defined to have the winning discrete moving off property
(abbreviated WDMOP) if the player K has a winning strategy SK in the game GKF (X).
This winning strategy is a function SK : F(Ẋ)<ω → K(X) assigning to any finite sequence
(F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ) of finite subsets of Ẋ a compact subset SK (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ) of X such that a family
(Fn )n∈ω of finite subsets of Ẋ is discrete in X if for every n ∈ ω the set Fn is disjoint with the
compact set SK (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ).
It is clear that WDMOP implies DMOP.
Lemma 2.6. If a topological space X has WDMOP, then the player K has a strategy SK : F(Ẋ)<ω →
K(X) in the game GKF (X) such that for any sequence (Fn )n∈ω of finite subsets of Ẋ the indexed
family {Fn \ SK (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 )}n∈ω is discrete in X.

6

TARAS BANAKH AND LEIJIE WANG

Proof. Since the space X has WDMOP, the player K has a winning strategy in the game GKF (X). This
winning strategy is a function W : F(Ẋ)<ω → K(X) such that a sequence (Fn )n∈ω of finite subsets
of Ẋ is discrete in X if Fn ∩ W (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ) = ∅ for every n ∈ ω. Define a strategy SK : F(Ẋ)<ω →
K(X) of the player K in the game GKF (X) assigning to each finite sequence (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ) ∈ F(Ẋ)<ω
the last element Kn of the sequence (K0 , . . . , Kn ) of compact subsets of X, defined by the recursive
formula: Ki = W (F0 \ K0 , . . . , Fi−1 \ Ki−1 ) for i ≤ n.
We claim that the strategy SK has the required property. Indeed, given any sequence (Fn )n∈ω of
finite subsets of Ẋ, define the sequence (Kn )n∈ω of compact subsets of X by the recursive formula
Kn = W (F0 \ K0 , . . . , Fn−1 \ Kn−1 ) for n ∈ ω. The definition of the strategy SK ensures that
Kn = SF (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ) for every n ∈ ω. For every n ∈ ω consider the finite subset En := Fn \ Kn
of Fn ⊂ Ẋ and observe that En is disjoint with the compact set Kn = W (E0 , . . . , En−1 ). Since the
strategy W is winning, the indexed family

(En )n∈ω = (Fn \ Kn )n∈ω = Fn \ W (F0 \ K0 , . . . , Fn−1 \ Kn−1 ) n∈ω = Fn \ SK (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ) n∈ω
is discrete in X.

3. A convenient base for the function space Ck′ (X, Y )
For topological spaces X, Y , let Ck (X, Y ) be the space of continuous functions from X to Y ,
endowed with the compact-open topology. This topology is generated by the subbase consisting of
the sets
[K; U ] := {f ∈ Ck (X, Y ) : f (K) ⊂ U }
where K is a compact subset of X and U is an open subset of Y .
By a pointed topological space we understand a topological space Y with a distinguished point
∗Y ∈ Y .
A pointed topological space Y is defined to be
• ∗-first-countable if Y is first-countable at its distinguished point ∗Y ;
• ∗-admissible if the distinguished point ∗Y of Y has a neighborhood U∗ which is not dense in
Y.
It is easy to see that a pointed topological space Y is ∗-admissible if Y is Hausdorff and contains
more than one point.
For a topological space X and a pointed topological space Y we shall study the Baire category
properties of the subspace

Ck′ (X, Y ) := f ∈ Ck (X, Y ) : f (X ′ ) ⊂ {∗Y } ⊂ Ck (X, Y ),

where X ′ := X \ Ẋ is the set of non-isolated points of X.
First we describe a convenient base of the topology of the function space Ck′ (X, Y ). For two sets
K ⊂ X and U ⊂ Y we keep the notation
[K; U ] := {f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) : f (K) ⊂ Y }.
Fix a base BY ∋ Y of the topology of the space Y and consider the family Q of all quadruples
(K, U, F, u), where
•
•
•
•

K is a compact subset of X;
U ∈ BY is a neighborhood of the distinguished point ∗Y of Y ;
F ⊂ Ẋ \ K is a finite set of isolated point in X;
u : Ẋ → BY is a function assigning to each point x ∈ Ẋ a non-empty basic open set u(x) ∈ BY
such that u(x) = Y if x ∈
/ F.

For any quadruple (K, U, F, u) ∈ Q, consider the open set

[K; U |F ; u] := [K; U ] ∩
[{x}; u(x)]

), and observe that this open set is not empty.
in the function space
The following lemma shows that the family {[K; U |F ; u] : (K, U, F, u) ∈ Q} is a base of the topology
of the function space Ck′ (X, Y ).
Lemma 3.1. For any quadruple (K, U, F, u) ∈ Q, function f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) and neighborhood Of ⊂
Ck′ (X, Y ) of f there exists a quadruple (K̃, Ũ , F̃ , ũ) ∈ Q such that
F ⊂ F̃ ,

K ∪ F ⊂ K̃ ∪ F̃ ,

Ũ ⊂ U

and

f ∈ [K̃; Ũ |F̃ ; ũ] ⊂ Of .

′
Proof. By definition of the compact-open topology
Tnon Ck (X, Y ), there are compact sets K1 , . . . , Kn ⊂
X and open sets U1 , . . . , Un ⊂ X such that f ∈ i=1 [Ki ; Ui ] ⊂ Of .
Choose any basic open set Ũ ∈ BY such that
\
∗Y ∈ Ũ ⊂ U ∩ {Ui : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, ∗Y ∈ Ui }.
S
Consider the compact set C = K ∪ F ∪ ni=1 Ki in X and observe that the open set V = (f ↾C)−1 (Ũ )
contains the set X ′ ∩ C. The set C \ V ⊂ Ẋ is finite, being a closed discrete subspace of the compact
space C. Then the union F̃ := (C \ V ) ∪ F ⊂ Ẋ is clopen in X and its complement K̃ := C \ F̃ is a
compact subset of X.
For every x ∈ Ẋ \ F̃ put ũ(x) = Y and T
for every x ∈ F̃ choose a basic neighborhood ũ(x) ∈ BY
of the point f (x) ∈ Y such that ũ(x) ⊂ {Ui : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, f (x) ∈ Ui }. It is easy to see that
T
f ∈ [K̃; Ũ |F̃ ; ũ] ⊂ ni=1 [Ki ; Ui ] ⊂ Of .


As a first application of the above base, we find a conditions of the topological spaces X, Y ensuring
that the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has countable cellularity.
We recall that a topological space has countable cellularity if it contains no uncountable family of
pairwise disjoint open sets.

Proposition 3.2. If the space Y is second-countable and the set Ẋ of isolated points of X is of type
Fσ in X, then the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has countable cellularity.
Proof. To derive a contradiction, assume that Ck′ (X) contains an uncountable family {Wi }i∈ω1 of
non-empty pairwise disjoint open sets. Fix a countable base BY of the topology of the space Y . By
Lemma 3.1, we can assume that each set Wi is of basic form Wi = [Ki ; Ui |Fi ; ui ] for some quadruple
(Ki , Ui , Fi , ui ) ∈ Q. By the ∆-Lemma [22, 9.18], there exists an uncountable subset Ω ⊂ ω1 and a
finite set F such that Fi ∩Fj = F for any distinct elements i, j ∈ Ω. By Pigeonhole Principle, for some
function u : F → BY the set {i ∈ Ω : ui ↾F = u} is uncountable. Replacing Ω by this uncountable
set, we can assume that ui ↾F = u for all i ∈ Ω.
S
By our assumption, the set Ẋ is an Fσ -set in X, so Ẋ = n∈ω Dn for some increasing sequence
(Dn )n∈ω of closed (discrete) sets Dn ⊂ X. By the Pigeonhole Principle, for some n ∈ ω the set
Ωn := {i ∈ Ω : Fi ⊂ Dn } is uncountable. Since the set Dn is closed and discrete in X, for every
i ∈ Ωn the compact set Ei := Ki ∩Dn is finite. By the ∆-Lemma [22, 9.18], there exists an uncountable
subset Λ ⊂ Ωn and a finite set E such that Ei ∩ Ej = E for any distinct elements i, j ∈ Λ. Now take
any element i ∈ Λ and observe that
F ∩ E ⊂ Fi ∩ Ei ⊂ Fi ∩ Ki = ∅.
Since each of the families (Fj \ F )j∈Λ and (Ej \ E)j∈Λ is disjoint, and the sets Fi , Ei are finite, the set
λ := {j ∈ Λ : (Fj \ F ) ∩ Ei 6= ∅} ∪ {j ∈ Λ : Fi ∩ (Ej \ E) 6= ∅}

8

is finite. Take any element j ∈ Λ \ (λ ∪ {i}) and observe that
Fi ∩ Kj = Fi ∩ Dn ∩ Kj = Fi ∩ Ej = (Fi ∩ (Ej \ E)) ∪ (Fi ∩ E) ⊂ ∅ ∪ (Fi ∩ Ei ) = ∅.
By analogy we can check that Fj ∩ Ki = ∅. This allows us to choose a (necessarily continuous)
continuous function f : X → Y such that
• f (x) ∈ u(x) for all x ∈ F ;
• f (x) ∈ ui (x) for all x ∈ Fi \ F ;
• f (x) ∈ uj (x) for all x ∈ Fj \ F ;
• f (x) = ∗Y for all x ∈ X \ (Fi ∪ Fj ).
It is clear that
f ∈ [Ki ; Ui |Fi , ui ] ∩ [Kj ; Uj ; Fj ; uj ] = Wi ∩ Wj ,
which is a desired contradiction.

4. A function space characterization of DMOP
In this section we shall characterize DMOP in terms of Baire category properties of function spaces
Ck′ (X, Y ).
We shall use the classical Oxtoby’s characterizations of Baire and meager spaces in terms of the
Choquet games GNE (X) and GEN (X), which are played by two players E and N (abbreviated from
Empty and Non-Empty) on a topological space X.
The game GNE(X) is started by the player N whose chooses a non-empty open set U1 of X. Then
player E responds selecting a non-empty open set V1 . In the nth inning the player N selects a nonempty open set Un ⊂ Vn−1 and the player E responds selecting a non-emptyTopen set VnT⊂ Un . At
the end of the game the player E is declared the winner if the intersection n∈N Un = n∈N Vn is
empty; otherwise the player N wins the game GNE (X).
The game GEN (X) is started by the player E whose chooses any non-empty open set U1 of X.
Then player N responds selecting a non-empty open set V1 . In the nth inning the player E selects a
non-empty open set Un ⊂ Vn−1 and the player N responds selecting a non-empty
T open setTVn ⊂ Un .
At the end of the game the player E is declared the winner if the intersection n∈N Un = n∈N Vn is
empty; otherwise the player N wins the game GEN (X).
The following classical characterization can be found in [29].
Theorem 4.1 (Oxtoby). A topological space X is
• meager if and only if the player E has a winning strategy in the game GNE (X);
• Baire if and only if the player E has no winning strategy in the game GEN (X).
A topological space X is defined to be Choquet if the player N has a winning strategy in the
Choquet game GEN (X).
Oxtoby’s Theorem 4.1 implies that
Choquet ⇒ Baire ⇒ non-meager.
By [23, 8.17] (see also [4, 7.3]), a metrizable topological space is Choquet if and only if it almost
complete-metrizable; moreover, any open continuous image of a Choquet space is Choquet and the
Tychonoff product of any family of Choquet spaces is Choquet [33].
A topological space X is defined to be
• complete-metrizable if X is homeomorphic to a complete metric space;
• Polish if X is separable and complete-metrizable;
• almost Polish if X contains a dense Polish subspace;
• almost complete-metrizable if X contains a dense complete-metrizable subspace.

We recall that a pointed topological space Y is ∗-admissible if its distinguished point ∗Y has a
neighborhood U∗ which is not dense in Y .
Lemma 4.2. Let X be a topological space and Y be a ∗-admissible pointed topological space. If the
function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is non-meager, then the space X has DMOP.
Proof. Assume that the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is non-meager. By Theorem 4.1, the player E has
no winning strategy in the Choquet game GNE (Ck′ (X, Y )). By Theorem 2.4, the DMOP for the space
X will follow as soon as we show that the player F has no winning strategy in the game GKF (X). Let
SF : K(X)<ω → F(Ẋ) be any strategy of the player F in the game GKF (X). The strategy SF assigns
to each finite sequence of compact sets (K0 , . . . , Kn ) ∈ K(X)<ω a finite set SF (K0 , . . . , Kn ) ⊂ Ẋ \ Kn .
Define a new strategy S̃F of the player F in the game GKF assigning to each sequence (K0 , . . . , Kn ) ∈
S
K(X)<ω the sequence SF (K̃0 , . . . , K̃n ) where K̃0 = K0 and K̃i = Ki ∪ j<i S̃F (K0 , . . . , Kj ) for
1 < i ≤ n.
Now we use the strategy S̃F , to describe a strategy SE of the player E in the Choquet game
GNE (Ck′ (X, Y )).
Let τ denote the family of all non-empty open sets in Ck′ (X, Y ). By our assumption, the pointed
space Y is ∗-admissible. So, there exists a non-empty open set W ⊂ Y whose closure does not contain
the distinguished point ∗Y of Y .
The definition of the compact-open topology ensures that for every U ∈ τ there exists a compact
set κ(U ) ⊂ X such that for any finite set F ⊂ Ẋ \ κ(U ) the open set U ∩ [F ; W ] is not empty.
For any sequence (U0 , . . . , Un ) ∈ τ <ω let SE (U0 , . . . , Un ) = Un ∩ [Fn ; W ] where
Fn = S̃F (κ(U0 ), . . . , κ(Un )) ⊂ Ẋ \ κ(Un )
is the answer of the player F to the moves (κ(U0 ), . . . , κ(Un )) of the player K in the game GKF (X),
according to the strategy S̃F . Since Fn ∩ κ(Un ) = ∅, the open set Un ∩ [Fn ; W ] is non-empty and
hence it is a legal move of the player E in the Choquet game GNE (Ck′ (X, Y )). Since the player E has
no winning strategy in the game GNE (Ck′ (X, Y )), the strategy SE is not winning. So there exists an
infinite
sequence (Un )n∈ω ∈ τ ω such that Un+1 ⊂ SE (U0 , . . . , Un ) for all n ∈ N and the intersection
T∞
′
n=1 Un is not empty and hence contains some function
S f ∈ Ck (X, Y ).
Let F0 = ∅ and for every n ∈ N let Kn = κ(Un ) ∪ i<n Fi and

Fn ⊂ W and
It follows that the family (Fn )n∈N is disjoint and f ∈ n∈N [Fn ; W ]. Since f

∗Y ∈
/ W , the continuity of f guarantees that the closure of the set ∞
n=1 Fn does not intersect the set
X ′ ⊂ f −1 (∗Y ) and hence the disjoint family {Fn }n∈N is discrete in X.
Observe that
K1 , F1 , K2 , F2 , . . .
is the sequence of the moves of the players K and F in the game GKF (X), where the player F plays
according to the strategy SF and eventually loses as the family {Fn }n∈N is discrete. So, the strategy
SF is not winning.

Lemma 4.3. Let Y be a ∗-first-countable pointed Choquet space. If a topological space X has DMOP,
then the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Baire.

Proof. By the ∗-first-countability of the pointed space Y , the distinguished point ∗Y of Y has a
countable neighborhood base {On }n∈ω such that On+1 ⊂ On for all n ∈ ω. Let τY be the family of
all non-empty open sets in Y . Since the space Y is Choquet, the player N has a winning strategy
SN : τY<ω → τY in the Choquet game GEN (Y ). The winning strategy SN is a function assigning to each
finite sequence (U0 , . . . , Un ) of non-empty open sets in X a non-empty
open set SN (U0 , . . . , Un ) ⊂ Un
T
such that for any infinite sequence (Un )n∈ω ∈ τYω the intersection n∈ω SN (U0 , . . . , Un ) is not empty if
Un ⊂ SN (U0 , . . . , Un−1 ) for any n ∈ N. Since the player E starts the game GEN (Y ), it is convenient to
assume that SN (∅) = Y for the empty sequence ∅ ∈ τY0 . We can also assume that SN (U0 , . . . , Un−1 ) =
Y if Ui = Y for all i < n.
′
To derive a contradiction, assume that the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is not Baire. Then
S Ck (X, Y )
contains a non-empty open meager subset W , which is contained in the countable union n∈ω Mn of
an increasing sequence (Mn )n∈ω of closed nowhere dense sets in Ck′ (X, Y ).
Replacing W by a smaller set and applying Lemma 3.1, we can assume that W is of basic form
W = [κ∅ ; U∅ |F∅ ; u∅ ]
for some quadruple (κ∅ , U∅ , F∅ , u∅ ) ∈ Q such that U∅ ⊂ O0 . Here we assume that the base BY of the
topology of Y coincides with the family τY of all non-empty open sets in Y .
For any n ∈ ω and any finite sequence s = (K0 , . . . , Kn ) ∈ K(X)n+1 we shall define inductively a
quadruple (κs , Us , Fs , us ) ∈ Q such that for the sequence t = (K0 , . . . , Kn−1 ) the following conditions
are satisfied:
(a) Ft ⊂ Fs ;
(b) κt ∪ Kn ⊂ κs ∪ Fs ;
(c) Us ⊂ Ut ∩ On+1 ;
(d) for every x ∈ Fs the set us (x) is contained in the set SN (us↾0 (x), . . . , us↾n (x)) where s↾i :=
(K0 , . . . , Ki−1 ) for i ≤ n;
(e) [κs ; Us |Fs ; us ] ⊂ [Kn \ Ft ; Ut ∩ On+1 ] ∩ [κt ; Ut |Ft ; ut ] \ Mn+1 .
Assume that for some n ∈ ω and all sequences s ∈ K(X)n the function fs and quadruple (κs , Us , Fs , us ) ∈
Q satisfying the inductive conditions (a)–(e) have been defined. Fix a sequence s = (K0 , . . . , Kn ) ∈
K(X)n+1 and consider the sequence t = s↾n = (K0 , . . . , Kn−1 ). For every x ∈ Ẋ consider the
non-empty open set
ws (x) = SN (us↾0 , . . . , us↾n (x)) ⊂ us↾n (x) = ut (x).
The definition of Q ensures that for any x ∈ Ẋ \ Ft we have us↾i (x) = Y for all i ≤ n and then
ws (x) = Y by the choice of the strategy SN . Then the quadruple (κt , Ut , Ft , ws ) belongs to the family
Q.
It is easy to see that the open set [Kn \ Ft ; Ut ∩ On+1 ] ∩ [κt ; Ut |Ft ; ws ] ⊂ Ck′ (X, Y ) is not empty
and hence contains some function fs ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ). Since the closed set Mn+1 is nowhere dense in
/ Mn+1 . Using Lemma 3.1, find a quadruple (κs , Us , Fs , us ) ∈ Q
Ck′ (X, Y ), we can assume that fs ∈
such that
fs ∈ [κs ; Us |Fs ; us ] ⊂ [Kn \ Ft ; Ut ∩ On+1 ] ∩ [κt ; Ut |Ft ; ws ] \ Mn+1
and the conditions (a)–(e) are satisfied.
Now define a strategy SF : K(X)<ω → F(Ẋ) of the player F in the game GKF letting
SF (K0 , . . . , Kn ) = F(K0 ,...,Kn) \ Kn = Fs \ Kn

for s = (K0 , . . . , Kn ) ∈ K(X)<ω .

By Theorem 2.4, the strategy SF of F is not winning. So there exists an infiniteS sequence s =
(Kn )n∈ω ∈ K(X)ω such that the family SF (s↾n) n∈ω is discrete in X. Then the set n∈ω SF (s↾n) ⊂
Ẋ is closed in X.
S
Consider the countable set D := n∈ω Fs↾n ⊂ Ẋ. The inductive condition (e) ensures that
us↾n (x) ⊂ SN (us↾0 (x), . . . , us↾(n−1) (x))

ON BAIRE CATEGORY PROPERTIES OF FUNCTION SPACES Ck′ (X, Y )

for every n ∈ N. Since the strategy SN is winning, the intersection
hence it contains some point f∞ (x) ∈ Y .
We claim that the function f : X → Y defined by

us↾n (x) is not empty and

is continuous.
It suffices to check that f is continuous at each non-isolated point x ∈ X ′ . Since (On )n∈ω is a
neighborhood base at ∗Y , for any k ∈ N it suffices to find a neighborhood Wx ⊂ X of x such that
f (Wx ) ⊂ Ok . Choose a neighborhood Wx of x which is disjoint with the closed set

SF (s↾i).

We claim that f (w) ∈ Ok for all w ∈ Wx . This is clear if w ∈
/ D. So assume that w ∈ D and find the
smallest number m ∈ ω such that w ∈ Fs↾m . Then w ∈
/ Fs↾(m−1) . The choice of the neighborhood Wx
ensures that m ≥ k and
w ∈ Fs↾m \ SF (s↾m) = Fs↾m \ (Fs↾m \ Km−1 ) = Fs↾m ∩ Km−1 .
Since w ∈
/ Fs↾(m−1) , the inductive conditions (e) ensures that
f (w) = f∞ (w) ∈ us↾m (x) ⊂ Om ⊂ Ok .
So f is continuous and belongs to Ck′ (X, Y ).
Next, we show that f ∈ [κs↾n ; Us↾n |Fs↾n ; us↾n ] for every n ∈ N. Given any x ∈ X, we should prove
that f (x) ∈ Us↾n if x ∈ κs↾n and f ∈ us↾n (x) if x ∈ Fs↾n . In the latter case the inclusion follows from
f (x) = f∞ (x) ∈ us↾n (x). So, we assume that x ∈ κs↾n . If x ∈
/ D, then f (x) = ∗Y ∈ Us↾n and we are
done. So, we assume that x ∈ D and hence x ∈ Fs↾(m+1) \ Fs↾m for some m ∈ ω. It follows from
x ∈ κs↾n ⊂ X \ Fs↾n that m ≥ n.
The inductive conditions (b), (e) and (c) ensure that x ∈ κs↾n \ Fs↾m ⊂ κs↾m and
f (x) = f∞ (x) ∈ us↾(m+1) (x) ⊂ Us↾m ⊂ Us↾n .
Therefore,

Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 imply the main result of this section.
Theorem 4.4. Assume that (Y, ∗Y ) is a ∗-admissible ∗-first-countable Choquet pointed space. For
any topological space X the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) Ck′ (X, Y ) is Baire;
(2) Ck′ (X, Y ) is not meager;

For a topological space X consider the function space
Ck′ (X, 2) := {f ∈ Ck (X, 2) : f (X ′ ) ⊂ {0}} ⊂ Ck (X, 2)
where the ordinal 2 = {0, 1} is endowed with the discrete topology.
Definition 4.5. A topological space X is defined to be
• Ck′ -meager if the function space Ck′ (X, 2) is meager;
• Ck′ -Baire if the function space Ck′ (X, 2) is Baire;

• Ck′ -Choquet if the function space Ck′ (X, 2) is Choquet.
Theorem 4.4 implies the following function space characterization of DMOP.
Corollary 4.6. For a topological space X the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) X has DMOP;
(2) X is Ck′ -Baire;
(3) X is not Ck′ -meager.
5. A function space characterization of WDMOP
In this section we shall prove that a topological space has WDMOP if and only if it is Ck′ -Choquet.
First, we prove a counterpart of Lemma 4.2.
Lemma 5.1. Let X be a topological space and Y be a ∗-admissible pointed topological space. If the
function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Choquet, then the space X has WDMOP.
Proof. Assume that the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Choquet, which means that the player N has a
winning strategy SN in the Choquet game GEN (Ck′ (X, Y )). The strategy SN assigns to each finite
sequence of non-empty open sets (U0 , . . . , Un ) in Ck′ (X, Y ) a non-empty open set SN (U0 , . . . , Un ) ⊂
′
U
Tn so that for any infinite sequence (Un )n∈ω of non-empty open sets in Ck (X, Y ) the intersection
n∈ω SN (U0 , . . . , Un ) is not empty if Un ⊂ SN (U0 , . . . , Un−1 ) for every n ∈ N. Since the player
E starts the game GEN (Ck′ (X, Y )), it convenient to assume that SN (∅) = Ck′ (X, Y ) for the empty
sequence of zero length.
By our assumption, the pointed space Y is ∗-admissible. So, there exists a non-empty open set
W ⊂ Y whose closure does not contain the distinguished point ∗Y of Y . By the definition of
the compact-open topology, for any non-empty open set U ⊂ Ck′ (X, Y ) there exists a compact set
κ(U ) ⊂ X such that for any finite set F ⊂ Ẋ \ κ(U ) the intersection U ∩ [F ; W ] is not empty.
Now we define a strategy SK of the player K in the game GKF (X). This strategy assigns to any
sequence (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ) of finite sets in Ẋ the compact set
[
Kn := κ(Un ) ∪
Fi
i<n

where (U0 , . . . , Un ) is a decreasing sequence of non-empty open sets in Ck′ (X, Y ), defined recursively
by U0 = Ck′ (X, Y ) and
(
SN (U0 ∩ [F0 ; W ], . . . , Ui ∩ [Fi ; W ]), if Ui ∩ [Fi ; W ] 6= ∅;
Ui+1 =
for i < n.
Ui ,
otherwise;

We claim that this strategy SK of player K is winning. Let (Fn )n∈ω be any sequence of finite
subsets of Ẋ such that for any n ∈ ω the set Fn is disjoint with the compact set SK (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ).
Let U0 = Ck′ (X, Y ) and (Un )n∈ω be the sequence of non-empty open sets in Ck′ (X, Y ) defined by the
recursive formula
Un+1 = SN (U0 ∩ [F0 ; W ], . . . , Un ∩ [Fn ; W ]) ⊂ Un
for n ∈ ω. Let us show that for every n ∈ ω the intersection Un ∩ [Fn ; W ] is not empty, which means
that the set Un+1 is well-defined. The intersection U0 ∩ [F0 ; W ] is not empty as U0 = Ck′ (X, Y ).
Assume that for some n ∈ N we have proved that the set Un−1 ∩ [Fn−1 ; W ] is not empty. Then the
set Un = SN (U0 ∩ [F0 ; W ], . . . , Un−1 ∩ [Fn−1 ; W ]) is not empty and by the definition of the strategy
SK , we get κ(Un ) ⊂ SK (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ). Since
Fn ∩ κ(Un ) ⊂ Fn ∩ SK (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ) = ∅,
the definition of the compact set κ(Un ) ensures that the open set Un ∩ [Fn ; W ] is not empty.

ON BAIRE CATEGORY PROPERTIES OF FUNCTION SPACES Ck′ (X, Y )

Now observe that for the sequence of non-empty open sets (Un ∩ [Fn ; W ])n∈ω we have the inclusion
Un+1 ∩ [Fn+1 ; W ] ⊂ Un+1 = SN (U0 ∩ [F0 ; W ], . . . , Un ∩ [Fn ; W ])
T
for all n ∈ ω. The winning property of the strategy SN ensures that the intersection n∈ω Un ∩[Fn ; W ]
is not empty and hence contains some function f ∈ Ck′ (X,

TY ).
S
It follows that the family (Fn )n∈N is disjoint and f ∈ n∈N [Fn ; W ]. Since f
Fn ⊂ W and
n∈ω
S
′
∗Y ∈
/ W , the continuity of f guarantees that the closure of the set ∞
n=1 Fn does not intersect X and
hence the disjoint family {Fn }n∈N is discrete in X.
For every n ∈ ω let Kn = SK (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 ) and observe that
K1 , F1 , K2 , F2 , . . .
is the sequence of the moves of the players K and F in the game GKF (X), where the player K plays
according to the strategy SK and eventually wins as the family {Fn }n∈N is discrete. So, the strategy
SK is winning and the space X has WDMOP.

Now we prove a “Choquet” version of Lemma 4.3.
Lemma 5.2. Let Y be a ∗-first-countable pointed Choquet space. If a topological space X has
WDMOP, then the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Choquet.
Proof. By our assumption, the distinguished point ∗Y of Y has a countable neighborhood base
{On }n∈ω such that On+1 ⊂ On for all n ∈ ω. Let τY be the family of all non-empty open sets
in Y . The family τY plays the role of the base BY in the definition of the family Q of quadruples
from Section 3.
Since the space Y is Choquet, the player N has a winning strategy SN : τY<ω → τY in the Choquet
game GEN (Y ). The strategy SN is a function assigning to each finite sequence (U0 , . . . , Un ) ∈ τY<ω
of non-empty open sets in Y a non-empty
T open set SN (U0 , . . . , Un ) ⊂ Un such that for any infinite
sequence (Un )n∈ω ∈ τYω the intersection n∈ω SN (U0 , . . . , Un ) is not empty if Un ⊂ SN (U0 , . . . , Un−1 )
for any n ∈ N. Since the player E starts the game GEN (Y ), it is convenient to assume that SN (∅) = Y
for the empty sequence ∅ ∈ τY0 . We can also assume that SN (U0 , . . . , Un−1 ) = Y if Ui = Y for all
i < n.
By Lemma 2.6, the player K has a strategy SK in the game GKF such that for any sequence (Fn )n∈ω
of finite subsets of Ẋ the indexed family {Fn \ SK (F0 , . . . , Fn−1 )}n∈ω is discrete in X.
Let τ be the family of all non-empty open sets in Ck′ (X, Y ). Let κ∅ = F∅ = ∅, U∅ = Y and
u∅ : Ẋ → {Y } ⊂ τY be the constant function.
For any n ∈ ω and any finite sequence s = (W0 , . . . , Wn ) ∈ τ n+1 we shall define inductively a
compact set Ks ⊂ X and two quadruples (κ̃s , Ũs , F̃s , ũs ), (κs , Us , Fs , us ) in Q such that the following
conditions are satisfied:
(a) [κ̃s ; Ũs |F̃s ; ũs ] ⊂ Wn ;
(b) Ũs ⊂ On+1 ∩ Us↾n , Fs↾n ⊂ F̃s , and κs↾n ⊂ κ̃s ∪ F̃s ;
(c) Ks = SK (F̃s↾0 , . . . , F̃s↾(n+1) );
(d) Fs = F̃s , Us = Ũs and κs = κ̃s ∪ Ks \ F̃s ;
(e) us (x) = SN (ũs↾0 (x), . . . , ũs↾(n+1) (x)) ⊂ ũs↾(n+1) (x) = ũs (x) for every x ∈ Ẋ;
(f) [κs ; Us |Fs ; us ] ⊂ [κ̃s ; Ũs |F̃s ; ũs ] ⊂ Wn .
Assume that for some n ∈ ω and all sequences s ∈ τ n a compact set Ks , and quadruples
(κ̃s , Ũs , F̃s , ũs ), (κs , Us , Fs , us ) satisfying the inductive conditions (a)–(f) have been defined. Fix a
sequence s = (W0 , . . . , Wn ) ∈ τ n+1 .
Using Lemma 3.1, find a quadruple (κ̃s , Ũs , F̃s , ũs ) ∈ Q satisfying the conditions (a), (b). Define
the compact set Ks by the formula (c). Finally define the quadruple (κs , Us , Fs , us ) by the conditions
(d) and (e). The conditions (a), (d), (e) imply the condition (f). This completes the inductive step.

14

TARAS BANAKH AND LEIJIE WANG

After completing the inductive construction, define a strategy $N : τ <ω → τ of the player N in the
Choquet game GEN (Ck′ (X, Y )) letting $N (s) = [κs ; Us |Fs ; us ] for any sequence s = (W0 , . . . , Wn ) ∈
τ <ω . The inductive condition (f) guarantees that $N (W0 , . . . , Wn ) ⊂ Wn .
We claim that the strategy $N is winning. Fix an infinite sequence s = (Wn )n∈ω ∈ τ ω such that
Wn ⊂ $N (W0 , . . . , Wn−1 ) = $N (s↾n) for every n ∈ N. The condition (f) of the inductive construction
ensures that for every n ∈ N we have the inclusions
[κs↾n ; Us↾n |Fs↾n ; us↾n ] ⊂ [κ̃s↾n ; Ũs↾n |F̃s↾n ; ũs↾n ] ⊂ Wn−1 ⊂
⊂ $N (s↾(n − 1)) = [κs↾(n−1) ; Us↾(n−1) |Fs↾(n−1) ; us↾(n−1) ],
which imply the inclusions
us↾n (x) ⊂ ũs↾n (x) ⊂ us↾(n−1) (x) = SN (ũs↾0 (x), . . . , ũs↾(n−1) (x))
holding for every x ∈ Ẋ.
Since the strategy SN is winning, for every x ∈ Ẋ the intersection
\
\
ũs↾n (x) =
us↾n (x)
n∈ω

n∈ω

is not empty and hence contains some point f∞ (x) ∈ Y .
The choice of the strategy SK guarantees that the indexed family
{Fs↾n \ SK (Fs↾0 , . . . , Fs↾(n−1) )}n∈ω

is discrete in X.
S
Consider the countable set D = n∈ω Fs↾n ⊂ Ẋ. We claim that the function f : X → Y defined
by
(
f∞ (x) if x ∈ D
f (x) =
0
otherwise
is continuous.
It suffices to check that f is continuous at each non-isolated point x ∈ X ′ . Since (On )n∈ω is a
neighborhood base at ∗Y , for any k ∈ N it suffices to find a neighborhood Wx ⊂ X of x such that
f (Wx ) ⊂ Ok . Choose a neighborhood Wx of x which is disjoint with the set
[

Fs↾(i+1) ∪

i<k

[

(Fs↾(i+1) \ SK (Fs↾0 , . . . , Fs↾i )).

We claim that f (z) ∈ Ok for all w ∈ Wx . This is clear if w ∈
/ D. So assume that w ∈ D and find the
smallest number m ∈ ω such that w ∈ Fs↾(m+1) . Then w ∈
/ Fs↾m . The choice of the neighborhood Wx
ensures that m ≥ k and
w ∈ SK (Fs↾0 , . . . , Fs↾m ) \ Fs↾m = Ks↾m \ Fs↾m ⊂ κs↾m .
The inductive conditions (b), (d) and the inclusion
[κs↾(m+1) ; Us↾(m+1) |Fs↾(m+1) ; us↾(m+1) ] ⊂ [κs↾m ; Us↾m |Fs↾m ; us↾m ]
ensure that f (w) = f∞ (w) ∈ us↾(m+1) (w) ⊂ Us↾m ⊂ Om ⊂ Ok . So f is continuous and belongs to
Ck′ (X, Y ).
Repeating the argument from the proof of Lemma 4.3, we can show that
\

so the intersection n∈ω Wn is not empty and the strategy $N is winning, which means that the

Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 imply the main result of this section.
Theorem 5.3. Assume that Y is a ∗-admissible ∗-first-countable pointed Choquet space. For any
topological space X the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) Ck′ (X, Y ) is Choquet;
(2) X has WDMOP;
(3) X is Ck′ -Choquet.
6. Introducing properties of X, responsible for the metrizability of Ck′ (X, Y )
In this section we introduce some properties of a topological space X, which will be used in subsequent sections for characterizing pairs X, Y for which the function spaces Ck′ (X, Y ) are metrizable,
(almost) complete-metrizable or (almost) Polish.
Definition 6.1. A topological space X is called
• κ̇-space if for any non-closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ of X there exists a compact set K ⊂ X such that
K ∩ D is infinite;
• ω-κ̇-space if for any non-closed countable subset D ⊂ Ẋ of X there exists a compact set
K ⊂ X such that K ∩ D is infinite;
• κ̇ω -space if there exists a countable family {Kn }n∈ω of compact subsets of X such that Ẋ ⊂
S
n∈ω Kn and for any non-closed set D ⊂ Ẋ of X there exists n ∈ ω such that D ∩ Kn is
infinite;
• hemi-κ̇ω -space if there exists a countable family {Kn }n∈ω of compact subsets of X such that
for any compact set K ⊂ X there exists n ∈ ω such that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn .
These properties relate as follows

Non-trivial implications in this diagram are proved in the following proposition.
Proposition 6.2.
(1) Each κ̇ω -space is both a κ̇-space and a hemi-κ̇ω -space.
(2) A topological space is a κ̇ω -space if and only if it is a hemi-κ̇ω -space and an ω-κ̇-space.
(3) Each κ̇ω -space has WDMOP.
(4) Each space with WDMOP is an ω-κ̇-space.
(5) A topological space is a κ̇ω -space if and only if it is a hemi-κ̇ω -space with WDMOP.
Proof. 1. The definitions imply that each κ̇ω -space X is a κ̇-space. To show that X is a hemi-κ̇ω space, take any sequence (Kn )n∈ω of compact subsets of X, witnessing that X is a κ̇ω -space. The
hemi-κ̇ω -space property of X willSfollow as soon as we check that for any compact set K ⊂ X there
exists n ∈ ω such that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ i≤n Ki . Assuming no such n exists, for every n ∈ ω we can choose
S
S
a point xn ∈ K ∩ Ẋ \ i≤n Ki . Since Ẋ ⊂ n∈ω Kn , the set D = {xn }n∈ω ⊂ K is infinite and hence
has an accumulation point x′ ∈ K ∩ X ′ ⊂ K \ D in the compact space K. Therefore, D is not closed
in X and the choice of the sequence (Kn )n∈ω yields a number n ∈ ω such that D ∩ Kn is infinite. On

the other hand, D ∩ Kn ⊂ {x0 , . . . , xn−1 } by the choice of the sequence (xn )n∈ω . This contradiction
shows that X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space.
2. Assume that X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space and an ω-κ̇-space. Let (Kn )n∈ω be a sequence witnessing
that X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space. We claim that this sequence witness that X is κ̇ω -space. Since each
singleton {x} ⊂ Ẋ is compact, there exists n ∈ ω such that {x} = {x} ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn , which implies
S
that Ẋ ⊂ n∈ω Kn . Given a non-closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ, it remains to find n ∈ ω such that Kn ∩ D
is infinite. To S
derive a contradiction, assume that D ∩ Kn is finite for every n ∈ ω. Then the set
D = D ∩ Ẋ = n∈ω D ∩ Kn is countable. Since X is an ω-κ̇-space, there exists a compact set K ⊂ X
such that K ∩ D is infinite. The choice of the sequence (Kn )n∈ω ensures that Ẋ ∩ K ⊂ Kn for some
n ∈ ω. Since D ∩ K = D ∩ Ẋ ∩ K ⊂ D ∩ Kn , the set D ∩ Kn is infinite, which contradicts our
assumption. This contradiction completes the proof.
3. Assume that X is a κ̇ω -space and let (Kn )n∈ω be a sequence of compact sets witnessing this
fact. It is easy to see that the function SK assigning to any finite sequence (F0 , . . . , Fn ) ∈ F(Ẋ)<ω
the compact set
[
SK (F0 , . . . , Fn ) =
(Fi ∪ Ki )
i≤n

is a winning strategy of the player K in the game GKF (X).
4. Assume that X has WDMOP and let A ⊂ Ẋ be a non-closed countable set in X. To derive a
contradiction, assume that every compact set K ⊂ X the intersection A ∩ K is finite.
By Theorem 5.3, the function space Ck′ (X, 2) is Choquet. The space Ck′ (X, 2) is a subspace of the
space Fk′ (X, 2) = {f ∈ 2X : f (X ′ ) ⊂ {0}}, endowed with the compact-open topology. A neighborhood
base of this topology at a function f ∈ Fk′ (X, 2) consists of the sets OK (f ) = {g ∈ Fk′ (X, 2) : g↾K =
f ↾K} where K runs over compact subsets of X.
Endow the doubleton 2 = {0, 1} with a group operation ⊕ in which 0 is a neutral element. This
group operation induces a continuous group operation on the space Fk (X, 2).
Let χ ∈ Fk′ (X, 2) be the function defined by χ−1 (1) = A. Since the set A is not closed in X, the
function χ is discontinuous. On the other hand, this function belongs to the closure Ck′ (X, 2) of the
subgroup Ck′ (X, 2) in Fk′ (X, 2) as for any compact set K ⊂ X the intersection K ∩ A ⊂ Ẋ is finite
and hence the restriction χ↾K is continuous.
By [6, Theorem 3], each Choquet topological group H is Gδ -dense in its Raikov completion H̄,
which means that H has non-empty intersection with any non-empty Gδ -subset of H̄.
This fact implies that the Choquet subgroup Ck′ (X, 2) is Gδ -dense in its closure Ck′ (X, 2). Then
the Gδ -set G = {f ∈ Ck′ (X, 2) : f ↾A = χ↾A} has common point f with the subgroup Ck′ (X, 2). Now
get a desired contradiction:
∅=
6 X ′ ∩ Ā ⊂ f −1 (0) ∩ f −1 (1) = f −1 (0) ∩ f −1 (1) = ∅.
5. If X is a κ̇ω -space, then it is a hemi-κ̇ω -spaces with WDMOP by the statements (1) and (3),
proved above. If X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space with WDMOP, then X is a κ̇ω -space by the statements (2)
and (4), proved above.

For topological spaces with countable set of isolated points we can prove a bit more.
Theorem 6.3. Let X be a topological space with countable set Ẋ of isolated points. Then
(1) X is a κ̇-space if and only if it is a ω-κ̇-space;
(2) X is a κ̇ω -space if and only if X has WDMOP.
Proof. 1. The first equivalent follows directly from the definitions.
2. If X is a κ̇ω -space, then it has WDMOP by Proposition 6.2(3). Now assume that X has WDMOP
and fix a winning strategy SN : F(Ẋ)<ω → K(X) of the player K in the game GKF (X). Here F(Ẋ) is

the family of finite subsets of Ẋ. Since the set Ẋ is countable, the family K = F(Ẋ) ∪ {SK (s) : s ∈
F(Ẋ)<ω } is countable, too.
Let K = {Kn }n∈ω be an
S enumeration of the family K. We claim that the sequence (K≤n )n∈ω of
the compact sets K≤n = i≤n Ki witnesses that X is a κ̇ω -space.
Given a non-closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ, we should show that the intersection D ∩ K≤n is infinite for
some n ∈ ω. By Proposition 6.2(4), there is a compact set K ⊂ X such that the intersection K ∩ D is
infinite. We claim that there exists n ∈ ω such that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ K≤n . To derive a contradiction, assume
that for every n ∈ ω the complement K∩ Ẋ\K≤n contains some point xn ∈ Ẋ. Since each subsequence
of the sequence (xn )n∈ω has an accumulation point in the compact space K ⊂ X, the player F has a
winning strategy by choosing his moves in the set {xn }n∈ω . But this is not possible as player K has
a winning strategy in the game GKF (X). This contradiction shows that K ∩ D ⊂ K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ K≤n for
some n ∈ ω. Then the intersection D ∩ K≤n ⊃ D ∩ K is infinite.

Theorem 6.3 implies that for any topological space X with countable set Ẋ we have the following
equivalences and implications:
hemi-κ̇ω -space
⇔ κ̇ω -space ⇔ WDMOP ⇒ κ̇-space ⇔ ω-κ̇-space.
and ω-κ̇-space
7. The metrizability of the function spaces Ck′ (X, Y )
Lemma 7.1. Let Y be a pointed topological space whose distinguished point ∗Y has a neighborhood
U∗ 6= Y . A topological space X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space if the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is first-countable
at the constant function c : X → {∗Y }.
Proof. Being first-countable at c, the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has a countable neighborhood base
{On }n∈ω at c. By the definition of the compact-open topology on Ck′ (X, Y ), for every n ∈ ω we can
find a compact subset Kn ⊂ X and a neighborhood Vn ⊂ Y of ∗Y such that c ∈ [Kn ; Vn ] ⊂ On . We
claim that the sequence (Kn )n∈ω witnesses that X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space.
Given a compact set K ⊂ X, we should find n ∈ ω such that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn . By our assumption,
the distinguished point ∗Y has an open neighborhood U∗ 6= Y . Consider the open neighborhood
[K, U∗ ] ⊂ Ck′ (X, Y ) of the constant function c and find n ∈ ω with On ⊂ [K; U∗ ]. Then the inclusion
[Kn ; Vn ] ⊂ On ⊂ [K; U∗ ] implies K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn . Indeed, assuming that K ∩ Ẋ 6⊂ Kn , we can find an
isolated point x ∈ K ∩ Ẋ \ Kn . Fix any point y ∈ Y \ U∗ and consider the map χx : X → {∗Y , y} ⊂ Y
defined by χ−1
x (y) = x. Since x is isolated in X, the map χx is continuous. Taking into account that
χx (Kn ) ⊂ {∗Y } and χx (x) = y ∈
/ U∗ , we conclude that χx ∈ [Kn ; Vn ] \ [K; U∗ ], which contradicts the
choice of n (with [Kn ; Vn ] ⊂ On ⊂ [K; U∗ ]).

For the proof of Corollary 7.5, we shall need the following refined version of Lemma 7.1.
Lemma 7.2. Let Y be a pointed topological space such that each point y ∈ Y has a neighborhood Oy
which is not dense in Y . A topological space X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space if the function space Ck′ (X, Y )
contains a dense subspace D, which is first-countable at some point δ ∈ D.
Proof. Let {On }n∈ω be a countable neighborhood base at the point δ of the space D. By Lemma 3.1,
for every n ∈ ω we can find a quadruple (Kn , Un , Fn , un ) ∈ Q such that δ ∈ D ∩ [Kn ; Un |Fn ; un ] ⊂ On .
We claim that the sequence (Kn ∪ Fn )n∈ω witnesses that X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space.
Given a compact set K ⊂ X, we should find n ∈ ω such that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn ∪Fn . By our assumption,
each point y ∈ Y has a neighborhood Oy , which is not dense in Y . By Lemma 3.1, there exists a
quadruple (κ, V, E, v) ∈ Q such that δ ∈ [κ; V |E; v], K ⊂ κ ∪ E, V ⊂ O∗Y and v(x) ⊂ Oδ(x) for all
x ∈ E. Since {On }n∈ω is a neighborhood base of the space D at δ, there exists n ∈ ω such that
On ⊂ [κ; V |E; v].

TARAS BANAKH AND LEIJIE WANG

We claim that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn ∪ Fn . Assuming that K ∩ Ẋ 6⊂ Kn ∪ Fn , we can find a point
x ∈ Ẋ ∩ K \ (Kn ∪ Fn ). Choose a non-empty open set Wx ⊂ Y such that Wx ∩ Oδ(x) = ∅ if
x ∈ E and Wx ∩ V = ∅ if x ∈
/ E. By the density of the set D in Ck′ (X, Y ), the intersection
D ∩ [Kn ; Un |Fn ; un ] ∩ [{x}; Wx ] contains some function f . Then f ∈ D ∩ [Kn ; Un |Fn ; un ] ⊂ On ⊂
[κ; V |E; v]. Since x ∈ K ⊂ κ ∪ E, the inclusion f ∈ [κ; V |E; v] implies that f (x) ∈ V if x ∈ κ and
f (x) ∈ v(x) ⊂ Oδ(x) if x ∈ E. In both cases, we get f (x) ∈
/ Wx , which contradicts the inclusion
f ∈ [{x}; Wx ]. This contradiction shows that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn ∪ Fn . Therefore, the sequence of compact
sets (Kn ∪ Fn )n∈ω witnesses that X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space.

Lemma 7.3. For any hemi-κ̇ω -space X and any metrizable space Y , the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is
metrizable.
Proof. Let (Kn )n∈ω be a sequence of
S compact sets witnessing that X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space. Replacing
each compact set Kn by the union i≤n Ki , we can assume that Kn ⊂ Kn+1 for all n ∈ ω.
Let d be any metric generating the topology of the space Y . For a point y ∈ Y and ε > 0 denote
by B(y; ε) := {x ∈ Y : d(y, x) < ε} the open ε-ball centered at y.
We claim that the metric ρ on Ck′ (X, Y ) defined by the formula
ρ(f, g) = max min{ 21n , max d(f (x), g(x))}
n∈ω

x∈Kn

for f, g ∈ Ck′ (X, Y )

generates the compact-open topology of the function space Ck′ (X, Y ).
By [14, 8.2.7], the compact-open topology on Ck′ (X, Y ) coincides with the topology of uniform
convergence on compacta, which implies that the metric ρ is continuous. It remains to check that for
any compact set K ⊂ X and any open set U ⊂ Y the subbasic open set [K; U ] := {f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) :
f (K) ⊂ U } is open in the metric space (Ck′ (X, Y ), ρ). Fix any function f ∈ [K; U ]. By the choice
of the sequence (Kn )n∈ω , there exists a number n ∈ ω such that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn . By the compactness
1
of the set f (K)
S ⊂ U , there exists a positive real number ε < 2n such that B(f (K); ε) ⊂ U , where
B(f (K); ε) = y∈f (K) B(y; ε).
We claim that any function g ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) with ρ(f, g) < ε belongs to [K; U ]. Given any z ∈ K,
we should check that g(z) ∈ U . If z ∈ X ′ , then g(z) = ∗Y = f (z) ∈ f (K) ⊂ U . If z ∈
/ X ′ , then
1
z ∈ K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn and then ε < 2n and

min 21n , max d(f (x), g(y)) ≤ ρ(f, g) < ε
x∈Kn

imply that d(g(z), f (z)) ≤ maxx∈Kn d(f (x), g(x)) < ε and finally, g(z) ∈ B(f (z); ε) ⊂ B(f (K), ε) ⊂
U.

Theorem 7.4. For a pointed topological space Y containing more than one point, and a topological
space X containing an isolated point, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is metrizable;
(2) the space Y is metrizable and X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space.
Proof. The implication (2) ⇒ (1) was proved in Lemma 7.3.
To prove that (1) ⇒ (2), assume that the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is metrizable. By Lemma 7.1,
X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space. By our assumption, the space X contains an isolated point x ∈ X. It is easy
to see that the function
H : Ck′ (X, Y ) → Y × Ck′ (X \ {x}, Y ), f 7→ (f (x), f ↾X \ {x}),
is a homeomorphism. Then the space Y is metrizable, being homeomorphic to a subspace the metriz
able space Y × Ck′ (X \ {x}, Y ) = H(Ck′ (X, Y )).
Theorem 7.4 and Lemma 7.2 imply the following corollary.

Corollary 7.5. For a pointed metrizable space Y containing more than one point, and a topological
space X containing an isolated point, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is metrizable;
(2) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) contains a dense first-countable subspace;
(3) X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space.
A topological space X is defined to have countable spread if each discrete subspace in X is at most
countable.
Lemma 7.6. Let Y be a pointed space such that the singleton {∗Y } is not dense in Y . A topological
space X has countable set Ẋ of isolated points if the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has countable spread.
Proof. By our assumption, the space Y contains a point y ∈ Y \ {∗Y }. For every x ∈ Ẋ let δx :
X → {∗Y , y} be the unique function with δx−1 (y) = {x}. Observe that the set Ux := {f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) :
f (x) ∈
/ {∗Y } is an open neighborhood of δx in Ck′ (X, Y ). Consider the subspace D = {δx : x ∈ Ẋ}
and observe that it is discrete, because Ux ∩ D = {δx } for all x ∈ Ẋ. Since the space Ck′ (X, Y ) has
countable spread, the discrete subspace D has at most countable cardinality ω ≥ |D| = |Ẋ|.

Lemma 7.7. Let Y be a ∗-admissible pointed space and X be a hemi-κ̇ω -space. If the function space
Ck′ (X, Y ) has countable cellularity, then Ẋ is at most countable.
Proof. Assuming that Ẋ is uncountable and taking into account that X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space, we can
find a compact set K ⊂ X such that Ẋ ∩ K is uncountable.
Since the pointed space Y is ∗-admissible, the point ∗Y has a neighborhood U∗ which is disjoint
with some non-empty open set V ⊂ Y . For every x ∈ K ∩ Ẋ consider the open set
Wx := [{x}; V ] ∩ [K \ {x}; U∗ ]
Ck′ (X, Y

) and observe that (Wx )x∈Ẋ∩K is an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint open sets in
in
′

Ck (X, Y ), which means that Ck′ (X, Y ) has uncountable cellularity.
Lemma 7.8. For any separable pointed space Y and any topological space X with countable set Ẋ of
isolated point, the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is separable.
Proof. Fix a countable dense set D ⊂ Y , containing the distinguished point ∗Y of Y . It is easy to see
that the countable set
{f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) : f (X) ⊂ D, |X \ f −1 (∗Y )| < ω}
is dense in Ck′ (X, Y ), which means that the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is separable.



Theorem 7.9. For a pointed topological space Y containing more than one point, and a topological
space X containing an isolated point, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is metrizable and separable;
(2) Y is a metrizable separable space, and X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space with countable set Ẋ of isolated
points.
Proof. To prove that (1) ⇒ (2), assume that the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is separable and metrizable.
By Theorem 7.4, the space Y is metrizable and X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space. By Lemma 7.6, the set Ẋ is
countable. Since the space X has an isolated point x, the space Y is separable, being the image of
the separable space Ck′ (X, Y ) under the continuous map δx : Ck′ (X, Y ) → Y , δx : f 7→ f (x).
(2) ⇒ (1) Assume that Y is a separable metrizable space, and X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space with countable set Ẋ of isolated points. By Theorem 7.4, the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is metrizable and by
Lemma 7.8, it is separable.

Theorem 7.9 and Lemmas 7.2, 7.7 imply the following characterization.
Corollary 7.10. For a pointed metrizable space Y 6= {∗Y } and a topological space X containing an
isolated point, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is metrizable and separable;
(2) Ck′ (X, Y ) contains a dense separable first-countable subspace;
(3) Y is separable and X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space with countable set Ẋ of isolated points.
8. The (almost) complete-metrizability of the function spaces Ck′ (X, Y )
In this section we characterize function spaces Ck′ (X, Y ) which are (almost) complete-metrizable
or (almost) Polish.
Theorem 8.1. For a pointed topological space Y containing more than one point, and a topological
space X containing an isolated point, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is complete-metrizable;
(2) the spaces Y and Ck′ (X, 2) are complete-metrizable;
(3) the space Y is complete-metrizable and X is a κ̇ω -space.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). Assume that the function space Ck (X, Y ) is complete-metrizable. Take any isolated
point x ∈ Ẋ and observe that the map
H : Ck′ (X, Y ) → Y × Ck′ (X \ {x}, Y ), H : f 7→ (f (x), f ↾X \ {x}),
is a homeomorphism. Then the space Y is complete-metrizable, being homeomorphic to a closed
subspace of the complete-metrizable space Ck′ (X, Y ).
Next, choose any point y ∈ Y \ {∗Y } and consider the bijective map e : {0, 1} → {∗Y , y} such that
e(0) = ∗Y and e(1) = y. The map e induces a closed topological embedding e∗ : Ck′ (X, 2) → Ck′ (X, Y ),
e∗ : f 7→ e ◦ f . Then the space Ck′ (X, 2) is complete-metrizable, as a closed subspace of the completemetrizable space Ck′ (X, Y ).
(2) ⇒ (3) Assume that the space Ck′ (X, 2) is complete-metrizable. We can endow the doubleton
2 = {0, 1} with the group operation having 0 as its neutral element and consider Ck′ (X, 2) as an
abelian metrizable topological group. Being complete-metrizable, this topological group is complete
in its uniformity (of uniform convergence on compacta).
Since the complete-metrizable space Ck′ (X, 2) is first-countable, there exist an increasing sequence
(Kn )n∈ω of compact subsets of X such that the sets

[Kn ; {0}] := f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) : f (Kn ) ⊂ {0} , n ∈ ω,

form a neighborhood base at the constant function e : X → {0}, which is the neutral element of the
group Ck′ (X, 2).
We claim that the sequence (Kn )n∈ω witnesses that X is a κ̇ω -space. First observe that for any
compact set K ⊂ X we can find n ∈ ω such that [Kn , {0}] ⊂ [K, {0}]. The latter inclusion implies
S
that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn . So, Ẋ ⊂ n∈ω Kn .
Next, we shall prove that a subset D ⊂ Ẋ is closed in X if D ∩ Kn is finite for every n. For
every n ∈ ω consider the continuous function fn ∈ Ck′ (X, 2) defined by fn−1 (1) = D ∩ Kn . We claim
that the sequence (fn )n∈ω is Cauchy in the uniformity of uniform convergence on compacta. Given
a compact set K ⊂ X, we should find n ∈ ω such that fm ↾K = fn ↾K for all m ≥ n. Consider
the open neighborhood [K; {0}] ⊂ Ck′ (X, 2) of the constant function e and find n ∈ ω such that
[Kn ; {0}] ⊂ [K; {0}]. The latter inclusion implies K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn . Then for any m ≥ n we get
D ∩ Kn ∩ K = D ∩ K = D ∩ Km ∩ K, which implies fn ↾K = fm ↾K. By the completeness of the group
Ck′ (X, 2), the Cauchy sequence (fn )n∈ω converges to a continuous function f∞ : X → 2. The only

−1 (1)
choice for this limit is the characteristic function of the set D, which implies that the set D = f∞
is closed in X by the continuity of f∞ .
(3) ⇒ (1) Assume that the space Y is complete-metrizable and X is a κ̇ω -space. Let (Kn )n∈ω
be an increasing sequence of compact sets, witnessing that X is a κ̇ω -space. For every n ∈ ω,
the compactness of Kn and the complete-metrizability
of Y imply the complete-metrizability of the
Q
function space Ck (Kn , Y ). Then the product n∈ω Ck (Kn , Y ) is complete-metrizable as well. The
proof of Lemma 7.3 implies that the map
Y
Ck (Kn , Y ), δ : f 7→ (f ↾Kn )n∈ω ,
δ : Ck′ (X, Y ) →
n∈ω

is a topological embedding.
Q
We claim that the image δ(Ck′ (X, Y )) is a closed subset of k∈ω Ck (Xn , Y ). Take any element
Q
(fn )n∈ω ∈ δ(Ck′ (X, Y )) ⊂ n∈ω Ck (Kn , Y ). It follows from (fn )n∈ω ∈ δ(Ck′ (X, Y )) that for every
n ≤ m the restriction fm ↾Kn coincides with the function fn and moreover fn (Kn ∩ X ′ ) ⊂ {∗Y }. So,
we can define a function f : X → Y by f (X ′ ) ⊂ {∗Y } and f ↾Kn = fn for every n ∈ ω. We claim
that the function f is continuous. It suffices to prove the continuity of f at each non-isolated point
x′ ∈ X ′ . Assuming that f is discontinuous at x′ , we can find an open neighborhood U∗ ⊂ Y of the
point ∗Y = f (x′ ) whose preimage f −1 (U∗ ) is not a neighborhood of x′ , which means that the set
D = X \ f −1 (U∗ ) ⊂ Ẋ contains the point x′ in its closure.
Since the sequence (Kn )n∈ω witnesses that X is a κ̇ω -space, for some n ∈ ω the intersection D ∩ Kn
is infinite. On the other hand, the set
D ∩ Kn = Kn \ f −1 (U∗ ) = Kn \ (f ↾Kn )−1 (U∗ ) = Kn \ fn−1 (U∗ ) ⊂ Kn ∩ Ẋ

is closed in Kn by the continuity of fn . Being a closed discrete subset of the compact space Kn , the
set D ∩ Kn is finite, which contradicts the choice of n. This contradiction shows that the function
f is continuous
and hence (fn )n∈ω = (f ↾Kn )n∈ω = δ(f ) ∈ δ(Ck′ (X, Y )). So, the set δ(Ck′ (X, Y )) is
Q
being homeomorphic to
closed in n∈ω Ck (Kn , Y ) and the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is complete-metrizable,
Q
′

the closed subspace δ(Ck (X, Y )) of the complete-metrizable space n∈ω Ck (Kn , Y ).
Theorems 8.1 and 7.9 imply the following characterization of Polish function spaces Ck′ (X, Y ).

Theorem 8.2. For a pointed topological space Y that contains more than one point, and a topological
space X containing an isolated point, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Polish;
(2) the spaces Y and Ck′ (X, 2) are Polish;
(3) the space Y is Polish and X is a κ̇ω -space with countable set Ẋ of isolated points.
Theorem 8.3. For a topological space X and a pointed Polish space Y the function space Ck′ (X, Y )
is Polish if and only if Ck′ (X, Y ) is a Choquet space with countable spread.
Proof. The “only if” part is trivial. To prove the “if” part, assume that the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is
Choquet and has countable spread. If Y = {∗Y }, then the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Polish, being a singleton.
So, we assume that Y 6= {∗Y }. By Theorem 5.3, the space X has WDMOP and by Lemma 7.6, the
set Ẋ is at most countable. By Theorem 6.3, X is a κ̇ω -space and by Theorem 8.2, the function space

Ck′ (X, Y ) is Polish.
Finally, we characterize pairs X, Y for which the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost completemetrizable or almost Polish.
Theorem 8.4. For a pointed metrizable space Y 6= {∗Y } and a topological space X with Ẋ 6= ∅, the
following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost complete-metrizable;

22

(2) the space Y is almost complete-metrizable and X is a κ̇ω -space.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) If Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost complete-metrizable, then it is Choquet and by Lemma 5.1,
X has WDMOP. By our assumption, the space X contains an isolated point x. It is easy to see that
the map δx : Ck′ (X, Y ) → Y , δx : f 7→ f (x), is an open surjection, so the space Y is Choquet. Being
metrizable, the Choquet space Y is almost complete-metrizable, see [23, 8.17] or [4, 7.3]. Being almost
complete-metrizable, the space Ck′ (X, Y ) contains a dense first-countable subspace. By Lemma 7.2,
X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space. By Proposition 6.2(5), X is a κ̇ω -space.
(2) ⇒ (1) Assume that the space Y is almost complete-metrizable and X is a κ̇ω -space. Then
Y contains a dense complete-metrizable subspace M ⊂ Y . Let Ỹ be any complete-metrizable space
containing Y as a dense subspace. By [23, 3.11], the complete-metrizable space M is a Gδ -set in Ỹ .
Since the singleton {∗Y } is a Gδ -subset of Ỹ , the union M ∪ {∗Y } is a Gδ -set in Ỹ . By [23, 3.11], the
space M ∪ {∗Y } is complete-metrizable. Replacing M by M ∪ {∗Y }, we can assume that ∗Y ∈ M .
By Theorem 8.1, the function space Ck′ (X, M ) is complete-metrizable. Since Ck′ (X, M ) is a dense

subspace in Ck′ (X, Y ), the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost complete-metrizable.
Theorem 8.5. For a pointed metrizable space Y 6= {∗Y } and a topological space X with Ẋ 6= ∅, the
following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost Polish;
(2) the space Y is almost Polish and X is a κ̇ω -space with countable set of isolated points.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) If Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost Polish, then Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost complete-metrizable. Moreover, Ck′ (X, Y ) is separable and hence has countable cellularity. By Theorem 8.4, the space Y is
almost complete-metrizable and X is a κ̇ω -space. By Lemma 7.7, the κ̇ω -space has countable set Ẋ
of isolated points.
It remains to prove that the space Y is almost Polish. We already know that Y is almost completemetrizable and hence Y contains a dense complete-metrizable subset M ⊂ Y . By [23, 3.11], M is
a Gδ -set in Y . By our assumption, the space X contains an isolated point x. It is easy to see that
the map δx : Ck′ (X, Y ) → Y , δx : f 7→ f (x), is an open surjection. This implies that the preimage
δx−1 (M ) is a dense Gδ -set in Ck′ (X, Y ). By our assumption, the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost Polish and
hence contains a dense Polish subspace P . Since the complement Ck′ (X, Y ) \ δx−1 (M ) is a meager
Fσ -set in Ck′ (X, Y ), the set P \ δx−1 (M ) is a meager Fσ -set in the Polish space P and its complement
P ∩ δx−1 (M ) is a dense Gδ -set in P , by the classical Baire Theorem. Then δx (P ∩ δx−1 (M )) is a dense
separable set in M , which implies that the complete-metrizable space M is separable and hence
Polish. Consequently, the space Y is almost Polish.
(2) ⇒ (1) Assume that the space Y is almost Polish and X is a κ̇ω -space with countable set of
isolated points. Let P be a dense Polish subspace in Y . Replacing P by P ∪ {∗Y }, we can assume
that ∗Y ∈ P . By Theorem 8.2, the function space Ck′ (X, P ) is Polish. Since the subspace Ck′ (X, P )

is dense in Ck′ (X, Y ), the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is almost Polish.
9. Countable networks in function spaces Ck′ (X, Y )
A family N of subsets of a topological space X is called
• a network if for any open set U ⊂ X and point x ∈ U there exists a set N ∈ N such that
x ∈ N ⊂ U;
• a cs∗ -network if for any open set U ⊂ X and sequence {xn }n∈ω ⊂ X that converges to a point
x∞ ∈ U there is a set N ∈ N such that x∞ ∈ N ⊂ U and N contains infinitely many points
xn , n ∈ ω;
• a k-network if for any open set U
S ⊂ X and compact subset K ⊂ U there exists a finite
subfamily F ⊂ N such that K ⊂ F ⊂ U ;

ON BAIRE CATEGORY PROPERTIES OF FUNCTION SPACES Ck′ (X, Y )

23

• a κ̇-network if for any compact set K ⊂ X and any closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ \ K of X there exists
S
a finite subfamily F ⊂ N such that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ F ⊂ X \ D.
It is clear that for any family N we have the implications
k-network ⇒ cs∗ -network ⇒ network.

In case of countable networks, we have the following equivalence, which was proved for Hausdorff
spaces in [20].
Lemma 9.1. Each countable cs∗ -network is a k-network.
Proof. Let N be a countable cs∗ -network for a topological space X. To prove that it is a k-network,
fix an open set W ⊂ X and a compact subset K ⊂ W . Consider the countable
subfamily NW :=
S
{N ∈ N : N ⊂ W } and write it as NW = {Nk }k∈ω . We claim that K ⊂ i≤n Ni for some n ∈ ω.
S
In the opposite case we can find a sequence of points xn ∈ K \ i≤n Ni . Observe that the family
{N ∩K : N ∈ N } is a countable network for the compact space K, which implies that K is hereditarily
Lindelöf and hence sequentially compact, by a result of Alas and Wilson [1]. This allows us to find
an increasing number sequence (kn )n∈ω such that the subsequence (xkn )n∈ω of the sequence (xk )k∈ω
converges to some point x∞ ∈ K. Since N is a cs∗ -network, there exists a set N ∈ N such that
N ⊂ W and the set Ω = {n ∈ ω : xkn ∈ N } is infinite. Since N ∈ NW , there exists a number m ∈ ω
such that N = Nm and then xi ∈
/ Nm = N for all i ≥ m. In particular, Ω ⊂
S{n ∈ ω : kn < m} is
finite, which contradicts the choice of N . This contradiction shows that K ⊂ i≤n Ni ⊂ W for some
n, which means that the family N is a k-network.

Now we prove some results on networks in the function spaces Ck′ (X, Y ).

Lemma 9.2. Let Y be a pointed topological space whose distinguished point ∗Y has a neighborhood
U∗ 6= Y . A topological space X has a countable κ̇-network if the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has a
countable network.
Proof. Let N be a countable network of the function space Ck′ (X, Y ). For every N ∈ N let N ∗ =
{x ∈ X : N ⊂ [{x}; U∗ ]}, where [{x}; U∗ ] = {f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) : f (x) ∈ U∗ }. We claim that the countable
family N ∗ = {N ∗ : N ∈ N } is a κ̇-network for the space X.
Given a compact set K ⊂ X and a closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ \ K of X, it suffices to find a set N ∈ N
such that K ⊂ N ∗ ⊂ X \ D. Fix any point y ∈ Y \ U∗ . Taking into account that the closed set
D ⊂ X consists of isolated points of X, we conclude that D is clopen in X. Then its characteristic
function χ : X → {∗Y , y} defined by χ−1 (y) = D is continuous and the set [K, U∗ ] is a neighborhood
of χ in Ck′ (X, Y ). Since N is a network of the topology of Ck′ (X, Y ), there exists N ∈ N such that
χ ∈ N ⊂ [K, U∗ ]. Observe that for each point x ∈ K and any function f ∈ N ⊂ [K, U ∗ ] we get
f (x) ∈ U∗ and hence f ∈ [{x}, U∗ ], which implies that N ⊂ [{x}; U∗ ] and hence K ⊂ N ∗ . On the other
hand, for every x ∈ D the function χ ∈ N does not belong to [{x}; U∗ ], which implies N 6⊂ [{x}; U∗ ]
and hence x ∈
/ N ∗ . This means that N ∗ ⊂ X \ D.

Lemma 9.3. For any topological space X with a countable κ̇-network and any pointed topological
space Y with a countable base, the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has a countable network N (which is a
countable k-network for Ck′ (X, Y ) if X is a ω-κ̇-space).
Proof. Let NX be a countable κ̇-network for the space X and BY be a countable base for the space Y .
We lose no generality assuming that the family NX is closed under finite unions. By the definition of a
κ̇-network, for any point x ∈ Ẋ there exists a set Nx ∈ NX such that {x} ⊂ Nx ⊂ X \(X \{x}) = {x},
which implies that Nx = {x} and hence the family NX contains all singletons {x} ⊂ Ẋ. Now the
countability of NX implies the countability of the set Ẋ.
Consider the family Q′ of quadruples (N, U, F, u) where N ∈ NX , U ∈ BY is a neighborhood of
∗Y , F ⊂ Ẋ \ N is a finite subset, and u : Ẋ → BY is a function such that u(x) = Y for all x ∈ Ẋ \ F .

24

TARAS BANAKH AND LEIJIE WANG

Since the sets NX , Ẋ, BY are countable, so is the family Q′ . For any quadruple (N, U, F, u) ∈ Q′
consider the set
\
{f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) : f (x) ∈ u(x)}.
[N ; U |F ; u] := {f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) : f (N ) ⊂ U } ∩
x∈F

We claim that the countable family N = [N ; U |F ; u] : (N, U, F, u) ∈ Q′ is a network for the space
Ck′ (X, Y ).
Take any function f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) and a neighborhood Of ⊂ Ck′ (X, Y ) of f . By Lemma 3.1, there
exists a quadruple (K, U, F, u) ∈ Q such that f ∈ [K; U |F ; u] ⊂ Of . It follows that K ⊂ f −1 (U ) and
the set D = X \ f −1 (U ) ⊂ Ẋ \ K is closed in X. By the definition of the κ̇-network NX , there exists
S
a finite subfamily F ⊂ NX such that K ∩ Ẋ ⊂S F ⊂ X \ (D ∪ F ) = f −1 (U∗ ) \ F . Since the family
NX is closed under finite unions, the set N = F belongs to N . Now it is easy to see that


f ∈ [N ; U |F ; u] ⊂ [K; U |F ; u] ⊂ Of .

Next, assuming that X is an ω-κ̇-space, we shall prove that the family N is a cs∗ -network for
). Given any open set W ⊂ Ck′ (X, Y ) and a sequence of functions {fn }n∈ω ⊂ W that converge
to a function f∞ ∈ W , we should find a quadruple (N, U, F, u) ∈ Q′ such that f∞ ∈ [N ; U |F ; u] ⊂ W
and [N ; U |F ; u] contains infinitely many functions fn . By Lemma 3.1, there exists a quadruple
(K, U, F, u) ∈ Q such that f∞ ∈ [K; U |F ; u] ⊂ W . Since [K; U |F ; u] is an open neighborhood
of f∞ , we can find a number m ∈ ω such that {fn }n≥m ⊂ [K; U |F ; u]. We claim that the set
S
D = n∈ω fn−1 (Y \ U ) ⊂ Ẋ is closed in X. Taking into account X is an ω-κ̇-space with countable
set Ẋ of isolated points, we conclude that X is a κ̇-space. Assuming that the set D is not closed in
−1 (U )
X, we can find a compact set C ⊂ X such that C ∩ D is infinite. Observe that the set C \ f∞
is finite (being discrete and closed in the compact space C). So, we can replace C by the compact
−1 (U ) and assume that f (C) ⊂ U . Since the sequence (f )
set C ∩ f∞
∞
n n∈ω convergesSto f∞ ∈ [C; U ],
there exists a number l ∈ ω such that fn ∈ [C; U ] for all n ≥ l. Then C ∩ D = n<l C \ fn−1 (U )
is finite, being a finite union of finite sets C \ fn−1 (U ). This contradiction finishes the proof of the
closedness of the set D. Since NX is a κ̇-network for X, there exists a set N ∈ NX such that
K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ N ⊂ X \ (D ∪ F ). It is easy to see that
Ck′ (X, Y

{fn }n≥m ⊂ [N ; U |F ; u] ⊂ W.
Therefore, N is a countable cs∗ -network. By Lemma 9.1, N is a countable k-network for the function

space Ck′ (X, Y ).
Lemmas 9.2 and 9.3 imply the following characterization.
Theorem 9.4. For a pointed metrizable space Y 6= {∗Y } and a topological space X 6= X ′ the following
conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has a countable network;
(2) the space Y is separable and the space X has a countable κ̇-network.
If X is a ω-κ̇-space, then the conditions (1),(2) are equivalent to
(3) the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has a countable k-network.
Problem 9.5. Is the condition (3) in Theorem 9.4 equivalent to the conditions (1) and (2) for any
topological space X?
Theorem 9.6. For a topological space X with DMOP the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) X has a countable κ̇-network;
(2) X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space with countable set Ẋ of isolated points.

ON BAIRE CATEGORY PROPERTIES OF FUNCTION SPACES Ck′ (X, Y )

25

Proof. (2) ⇒ (1) First assume that X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space with countable set Ẋ of isolated points,
and find a sequence (Kn )n∈ω of
Scompact sets witnessing that X is hemi-κ̇ω -compact. Replacing each
compact set Kn by the union i≤n Ki , we can assume that Kn ⊂ Kn+1 for all n ∈ ω. We claim that
the countable family
N = {Kn \ F : n ∈ ω, F ∈ F(Ẋ)}
is a κ̇-network for X. Indeed, for any compact set K ⊂ X and any closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ \ K of X,
we can find n ∈ ω with K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ Kn and observe that the set F = Kn ∩ D is finite (being closed
and discrete in the compact space Kn ). Then the set N = Kn \ F ∈ N has the required property:
K ∩ Ẋ ⊂ N ⊂ X \ D.
(1) ⇒ (2) Assume that the space X has a countable κ̇-network. By Corollary 4.6 and Theorem 9.4,
the function space Ck′ (X, 2) is Baire and has a countable network. By [6], each Baire topological
group with countable network is metrizable and separable. Applying this result to the space Ck′ (X, 2)
(carrying a structure of a topological group), we conclude that Ck′ (X, 2) is metrizable and separable.
By Theorem 7.9, X is a hemi-κ̇ω -space with countable set of isolated points.

10. Recognizing ∞-meager function spaces Ck′ (X, Y )
Lemma 4.2 implies that for any ∗-admissible pointed space Y and any topological space X that does
not satisfy DMOP the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is meager. In this section we prove that the meagerness
of Ck′ (X, Y ) in this result can be improved to a stronger property, called the ∞-meagerness.
Definition 10.1. A subset A of a topological space X is called
• ∞-dense in X if for any compact Hausdorff space K the subset Ck (K, A) = {f ∈ Ck (K, X) :
f (K) ⊂ A} is dense in Ck (K, X);
• ∞-codense in X if the complement X \ A is ∞-dense in X;
• ∞-meager in X if A is contained in a countable union of closed ∞-codense subsets of X.
A topological space X is ∞-meager if it X is an ∞-meager subset of X.
It is easy to see that each closed ∞-codense set is nowhere dense, so each ∞-meager set is meager.
For future applications, ∞-meager spaces are important as the ∞-meagerness implies the σZ-space
property, which is a key ingredient in many characterization results of Infinite-Dimensional Topology,
see [5], [7], [10], [12], [27], [28], [30].
Theorem 10.2. If a topological space X does not have DMOP, then for any ∗-admissible pointed
topological space (Y, ∗Y ), the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is ∞-meager.
Proof. Assuming that X does not have DMOP and applying Lemma 4.2, we conclude that S
the function
space Ck′ (X, 2) is meager and hence can be written as the countable union Ck′ (X, 2) = n∈ω Mn of
closed nowhere dense subsets Mn in Ck′ (X, 2).
Since the pointed space Y is ∗-admissible, the point ∗Y has an open neighborhood U∗ ⊂ Y which
is not dense in Y . Let χ : Y → {0, 1} be a (unique) function such that χ−1 (0) = U∗ . Observe that
for every function f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) the composition χ ◦ f : X → 2 is a continuous function that belongs
to the space Ck′ (X, 2). So, for every n ∈ ω we can consider the set
Zn := {f ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) : χ ◦ f ∈ Mn } ⊂ Ck′ (X, Y )
S
and its closure Z̄n in Ck′ (X, Y ). It is clear that Ck′ (X, Y ) = n∈ω Z̄n .
It remains to prove that each set Z̄n is ∞-codense in Ck′ (X, Y ). Given any compact Hausdorff
space K, continuous map µ : K → Ck′ (X, Y ), and neighborhood Oµ ⊂ Ck (K, Ck′ (X, Y )) of µ, we need
to find a continuous map µ′ ∈ Oµ such that µ′ (K) ∩ Z̄n = ∅.
On the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) consider the base B of the topology, consisting of the sets [K1 ; U1 ]∩
· · · ∩ [Km ; Um ] where K1 , . . . , Km are non-empty compact sets in X and U1 , . . . , Um are non-empty
open sets in Y .

26

TARAS BANAKH AND LEIJIE WANG

We lose no generality assuming that the neighborhood Oµ is of basic form
Oµ =

m
\

[Ki ; Bi ]

i=1

where K1 , . . . , Km are compact sets in K and B1 , . . . , Bm ∈ B. For any i ≤ m find a finite family
Ki of T
non-empty compact sets in X and a function uiS: Ki S
→ τY to the topology τY of Y such that
Bi = κ∈Ki [κ; ui (κ)]. Consider the compact set C := m
Ki and the open neighborhood
i=1
V∗ = U∗ ∩

m \
\
{ui (κ) : κ ∈ Ki , ∗Y ∈ ui (κ)}

i=1

of ∗Y .
For a point z ∈ K it will be convenient to denote the function µ(z) ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ) by µz . Since
µz (C ∩ X ′ ) ⊂ µz (X ′ ) ⊂ {∗Y } ⊂ V∗ , there exists a finite set Fz ⊂ C ∩ Ẋ such that µz (C \ Fz ) ⊂ V∗ .
Then [C \ Fz ; V∗ ] is an open neighborhood of the function µz in Ck′ (X, Y ) and by the continuity of the
map µ : K → Ck′ (X, Y ), there exists an open neighborhood Oz ⊂ K of z such that µ(Oz ) ⊂ [C\Fz ; V∗ ].
By the compactness of K, the open cover {Oz : z ∈ K} of K has a finite subcover {Oz : z ∈ E}.
S
Then for the finite set F = z∈E Fz ⊂ C ∩ Ẋ we have the inclusion µ(K) ⊂ [C \ F ; V∗ ].
Observe that the map
H : Ck′ (X, 2) → 2F × Ck′ (X \ F, 2), H : f 7→ (f ↾F, f ↾X \ F ),

is a homeomorphism. For every function v : F → 2 consider the open embedding ev : Ck′ (X \ F, 2) →
Ck′ (X, 2) assigning to each function f ∈ Ck′ (X \F, 2) the function ev f : X → 2 such that ev f ↾X \F = f
and ev f ↾F = v. The nowhere density of the closed set Mn in Ck′ (X, 2) implies that the finite union
[
M=
e−1
v (Mn )
v∈2F

is closed and nowhere dense in

Ck′ (X

\ F, 2). So, we can choose a function

~ ∈ [C \ F ; {0}] ∩ Ck′ (X \ F, 2) \ M
and using the definition of the compact-open topology on Ck′ (X \ F, 2), find a compact set A ⊂ X \ F
such that the neighborhood
O~ := {f ∈ Ck′ (X \ F, 2) : f ↾A = ~↾A}
does not intersect
the set M . Replacing A by A ∪ (C \ F ), we can assume that C \ F ⊂ A. It follows
S
that the set v∈2F ev (O~ ) is disjoint with the set Mn . The continuity of the function ~ ∈ Ck′ (X \ F, 2)
implies that the set A∗ := A ∩ ~−1 (0) is compact and has finite complement A \ A∗ . Moreover, since
~ ∈ [C \ F ; {0}], the set A∗ contains C \ F , which implies that C ∩ (A \ A∗ ) = ∅.
Since the set U∗ is not dense in Y , there exists a point y ∈ Y \ Ū∗ . Now consider the map
µ′ : K → Ck′ (X, Y ) assigning to each z ∈ K the function µ′z : X → Y defined by the formula


µz (x) if x ∈ F
′
µz (x) = y
if x ∈ A \ A∗


∗Y
otherwise.

It is easy to see that the map µ′ : K → Ck′ (X, Y ) is continuous and µ′ ∈ Oµ . It remains to prove that
µ′ (K)∩ Z̄n = ∅. Observe that the set µ′ (K) is contained in the open subset W := [A∗ ; V∗ ]∩[A\A∗ ; Y \
Ū∗ ] of Ck′ (X, Y ). So, it suffices to prove that W ∩ Zn = ∅. Take any function w ∈ W and consider the
function v = χ ◦ w↾F . The inclusion w ∈ W yields the equality χ ◦ w↾A = ~↾A implying the inclusion
χ ◦ w↾X \ F ⊂ O~ ⊂ Ck′ (X \ F, 2) \ M and χ ◦ w = ev (χ ◦ w↾X \ F ) ∈ ev (O~ ) ⊂ Ck′ (X, 2) \ Mn and
hence w ∈

11. A dichotomy for analytic function spaces Ck′ (X, Y )
A topological space X is defined to be analytic if there exists a surjective continuous map f : P →
X, defined on some Polish space P . By an old result of Christensen [13, Theorem 5.4], each Baire
analytic commutative topological group is Polish. We use this fact to prove the following dichotomy,
which is the main result of this section.
Theorem 11.1. Let Y be a pointed Polish space. If for some topological space X the function space
Ck′ (X, Y ) is analytic, then Ck′ (X, Y ) is either Polish or ∞-meager.
Proof. If Y = {∗Y }, then Ck′ (X, Y ) is a Polish space, being a singleton. So, assume that Y 6= {∗Y }
and fix any point y ∈ Y \ {∗Y }. Let e : 2 → {∗Y , y} be the map defined by e(0) = ∗Y and e(1) = y.
The map e induces a closed embedding e∗ : Ck′ (X, 2) → Ck′ (X, Y ), e∗ : f 7→ e ◦ f . Now we see
that the space Ck′ (X, 2) is analytic, being homeomorphic to a closed subspace of the analytic space
Ck′ (X, Y ). Since Ck′ (X, 2) carries a natural structure of a commutative topological group, we can
apply Christensen’s Theorem 5.4 [13] and conclude that Ck (X ′ , 2) is either Polish or meager.
If Ck′ (X, 2) is Polish, then by Theorem 8.2, X is a κ̇ω -space with countable set Ẋ of isolated points.
By Theorem 8.2, the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Polish.
If Ck′ (X, 2) is meager, then by Corollary 4.6, the space X does not DMOP and by Theorem 10.2,

the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is ∞-meager.
Now we prove that the analyticity of a cosmic function space Ck′ (X, Y ) is equivalent to the analyticity of the space

Cp′ (X, Y ) = f ∈ Cp (X, Y ) : f (X ′ ) ⊂ {∗Y } ⊂ Cp (X, Y ).

Here by Cp (X, Y ) we denote the space C(X, Y ), endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence.
This topology coincides with the Tychonoff product topology, inherited from Y X .
A topological space X is called cosmic if it is regular and has a countable network. A function
f : X → Y between two topological spaces is called Borel if for any open set U ⊂ Y the preimage
f −1 (U ) is a Borel subset of X.
Proposition 11.2. For a pointed regular topological space Y and a topological space X, the following
conditions are equivalent:
(1) the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is analytic;
(2) the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is cosmic and the space Cp′ (X, Y ) is analytic.
Proof. If Y = {∗Y }, then both spaces Ck′ (X, Y ) and Cp′ (X, Y ) are singletons and the conditions
(1), (2) are satisfied and hence are equivalent. So, we assume that Y 6= {∗Y }. The regularity of the
space Y implies the regularity of the spaces Cp (X, Y ) ⊂ Y X and Ck (X, Y ), see [14, 3.4.13].
(1) ⇒ (2) If the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is analytic, then it is cosmic, being a continuous image of some
Polish space, see [18, 4.9]. The space Cp′ (X, Y ) is analytic, being a continuous image of the analytic
space Ck′ (X, Y ).
(2) ⇒ (1) Now assume that the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is cosmic and the space Cp′ (X, Y ) is analytic.
Observe that the identity map Ck′ (X, Y ) → Cp′ (X, Y ) is continuous. We claim that the identity map
Cp′ (X, Y ) → Ck′ (X, Y ) is Borel. Since the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is hereditarily Lindelöf (being cosmic), it
suffices to check that for any compact set K ⊂ X and any open set the subbasic open set [K; U ] ⊂
Ck (X, Y ) is Borel in Cp′ (X, Y ). This is trivially true if [K; U ] is empty. So we assume that [K; U ] 6= ∅.
The space Ck′ (X, Y ), being cosmic, has countable spread. Applying Lemma 7.6, we conclude that
the set Ẋ is at most countable.

If K ∩ X ′ = ∅, then K is finite and the set [K; U ] is open in Cp′ (X, Y ). If K ∩ X ′ 6= ∅, then

is a Gδ -set in
Therefore, the identity map Cp′ (X, Y ) → Ck′ (X, Y ) is Borel. By [8], a cosmic space is analytic if
and only if it is a Borel image of a Polish space. This characterization implies that the cosmic space
Ck′ (X, Y ) is analytic, being a Borel image of the analytic space Cp′ (X, Y ).

12. The interplay between the function spaces Ck′ (X, Y ) and Ck′ (X/X ′ , Y )
Given a non-discrete topological space X, by X/X ′ we denote the quotient topological space (with
the set X ′ , collapsed to the point {X ′ } ∈ X/X ′ := (X \ X ′ ) ∪ {X ′ }) and observe that X/X ′ is a
Hausdorff space with a unique non-isolated point {X ′ }. So, (X/X ′ )′ is a singleton.
For every pointed topological space (Y, ∗Y ) the quotient map q : X → X/X ′ induces a continuous
bijective map
q ∗ : Ck′ (X/X ′ , Y ) → Ck′ (X ′ , Y ), q ∗ : f 7→ f ◦ q.
This map is a homeomorphism if the quotient map q is compact-covering in the sense that any
compact set K ⊂ X/X ′ is contained in the image q(C) of some compact set C ⊂ X. In this
case the investigation of the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) can be reduced to studying the function space
Ck′ (X/X ′ , Y ) over the space X/X ′ with a unique non-isolated point.
However in many natural situations the quotient map q : X → X/X ′ is not compact-covering. In
particular, it is not compact-covering for the space X = ω1 of all countable ordinals endowed with
the order topology. The reason is that the space ω1 is pseudocompact but not compact. We recall
that a Tychonoff space X is pseudocompact if each continuous real-valued function on X is bounded.
Example 12.1. If X is a non-compact pseudocompact space X with dense set Ẋ of isolated points,
then
(1) the space X does not has DMOP;
(2) the space X/X ′ is compact;
(3) the function space Ck′ (X, 2) is meager but Ck′ (X/X ′ , 2) is discrete;
(4) the quotient map q : X → X/X ′ is not compact-covering.

Proof. 1. To see that X does not have DMOP, observe that the family of singletons {x} : x ∈ Ẋ
is moving off, but contains no infinite discrete subfamily (otherwise X would admit an unbounded
real-valued continuous function).
2. Since the pseudocompactness is preserved by continuous images, the quotient space Q = X/X ′
is pseudocompact. Since Q has only one non-isolated point, it is compact. Indeed, given any open
cover U of Q, we can find an open set U ∈ U containing the unique non-isolated point q of the space
X. We claim that the complement Q \ U is finite. Otherwise, we could find a sequence (xn )n∈ω of
pairwise distinct points in Q \ U and define a continuous unbounded function f : Z → R by the
formula
(
n, if x = xn for some n ∈ N;
f (x) =
0, otherwise.
But the existence of such unbounded continuous function f contradicts the pseudocompactness of
the space Q = q(X).
3. Since the space X does not have DMOP, the function space Ck′ (X, 2) is meager by Theorem 4.4.
Since the space X/X ′ is compact, the function space Ck′ (X/X ′ , 2) is discrete.

4. Assuming that the quotient map q : X → X/X ′ = Q is compact-covering, we could find a
compact set K ⊂ X such that q(K) = Q. Then K contains all isolated points of the space. Since the
set Ẋ is dense in X, we conclude that X ⊂ K = K and the space X is compact, which contradicts
our assumptions.

Now we shall characterize topological spaces X for which the quotient map q : X → X/X ′ is
compact-covering.
A topological space X is called a µ-space if each closed bounded subset of X is compact. A subset
B of a topological space X is bounded if for any continuous function f : X → R the image f (B) is a
bounded subset of the real line. It is known [3, 6.9.7] that the class of µ-spaces includes all Diedounnécomplete spaces, and consequently, all paracompact spaces [14, 8.5.13] and all submetrizable spaces
[3, 6.10.8].
Definition 12.2. A topological space X is called a µ̇-space if for any subset A ⊂ Ẋ the following
conditions are equivalent:
• A is contained in a compact subset of X;
• for any closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ of X the intersection A ∩ D is finite.
Theorem 12.3. Let Y be a pointed topological space whose distinguished point ∗Y has an open
neighborhood U∗ 6= Y . For a non-discrete topological space X the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) X is a µ̇-space;
(2) the quotient map q : X → X/X ′ is compact-covering;
(3) the map q ∗ : Ck′ (X/X ′ , Y ) → Ck′ (X, Y ), q ∗ : f 7→ f ◦ q, is a homeomorphism.
The conditions (1)–(3) follow from the condition
(4) X is a µ-space.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) Assume that X is a µ̇-space. Given any compact subset K ⊂ X/X ′ , observe that
the set A = q −1 (K) \ X ′ has finite intersection A ∩ D with any closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ of X (because K
is compact and q(X \ D) is an open neighborhood of the unique non-isolated point of X/X ′ ). Since
X is a µ̇-space, the set A is contained in some compact subset K̃ of X. Replacing K̃ by a larger
compact set, we can assume that K̃ ∩ X ′ 6= ∅. Then q(K̃) is a compact subset of X/X ′ , containing
K, which means that q is compact-covering.
(2) ⇒ (1) Assume that the quotient map q is compact-covering. To prove that X is a µ̇-space, take
any set A ⊂ Ẋ that has finite intersection A ∩ D with any closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ of X. The definition
of the quotient topology on X/X ′ ensures that the subset q(A ∪ X ′ ) ⊂ X/X ′ is compact. Since q is
compact-covering, there exists a compact set K ⊂ X such that q(A ∪ X ′ ) ⊂ q(K) and hence A ⊂ K.
(2) ⇒ (3) It is easy to see (from the definition of the compact-open topology) that the compactcovering property of the quotient map q : X → X/X ′ implies that the continuous bijective map
q ∗ : Ck′ (X/X ′ , Y ) → Ck′ (X, Y ) is a homeomorphism.
(3) ⇒ (2) Assuming that q ∗ : Ck′ (X/X ′ , Y ) → Ck (X, Y ) is a homeomorphism, we shall prove that
the map q : X → X/X ′ is compact-covering. By our assumption, the distinguished point ∗Y of Y
has an open neighborhood U∗ that does not contain some point y ∈ Y . Given a compact subset
K ⊂ X/X ′ , consider the open neighborhood [K; U∗ ] of the constant function X/X ′ → {∗Y } ⊂ Y .
Since the map q ∗ is open, the image q ∗ ([K; U∗ ]) is an open neighborhood of the constant function
X → {∗Y } ⊂ Y . Consequently, there exists a compact set K̃ ⊂ X and a neighborhood U ⊂ Y of ∗Y
such that [K̃; U ] ⊂ q ∗ ([K; U ∗ ]). Replacing K̃ by a larger compact set, we can assume that K̃ ∩X ′ 6= ∅.
We claim that K ⊂ q(K̃). Given any point x ∈ K, we should prove that x ∈ q(K̃). If x is
not isolated in X/X ′ , then x ∈ q(X ′ ) = q(X ′ ∩ K̃). So we assume that x is isolated in X/X ′
and hence x = q(x̃) for a unique isolated point x̃ ∈ Ẋ. We claim that x̃ ∈ K̃. In the opposite

30

case, we can consider the function χ : X → {∗Y , y} defined by χ−1 (y) = {x̃}, and observe that
χ ∈ [K̃; U ] ⊂ q ∗ ([K; U∗ ]), which implies that y ∈ U∗ . But this contradicts the choice of the point y.
This contradiction shows that x̃ ∈ K̃ and hence x = q(x̃) ∈ q(K̃) and the map q is compact-covering.
(4) ⇒ (1) Finally, assuming that X is a µ-space, we prove that it is a µ̇-space. Fix any subset
A ⊂ Ẋ that has finite intersection A ∩ D with any closed subset D ⊂ Ẋ of X. Assuming that
Ā is not compact in the µ-space X, we conclude that the set A is not bounded. So there exists a
continuous function f : X → R such that the set f (A) is unbounded in the real line. Then we can
choose a sequence {an }n∈ω ⊂ A such that |f (an )| > n for every n ∈ ω. The continuity of the function
f ensures that the sequence (an )n∈ω has no accumulation points in X, which means that the set
D = {an }n∈ω is closed in X and hence has a finite intersection D ∩ A = D with A, which is not true.
This contradiction shows that X is a µ̇-space.

Now we recall the definitions of some familiar properties of topological spaces that correspond to
the properties introduced in Definition 6.1.
Definition 12.4. A topological space X is called
• a k-space if a set F ⊂ X is closed if for any compact set K ⊂ X the intersection F ∩ K is
closed in K;
• a kω -space if there exists a countable family K of compact sets in X such that a set F ⊂ X
is closed if for any K ∈ K the intersection F ∩ K is closed in K;
• hemicompact if there exists a countable family K of compact sets such that each compact
subset of X is contained in some set K ∈ K.
Comparing Definitions 6.1 and 12.4, we can see that a topological space with a unique non-isolated
point X is a κ̇-space (resp. a κ̇ω -space, a hemi-κ̇ω -space) if and only if X is a k-space (resp. a kω -space,
a hemicompact space). Using these equivalences, we can prove the following characterization.
Proposition 12.5. A µ̇-space X
(1) has DMOP iff X/X ′ has DMOP iff X/X ′ has MOP;
(2) has WDMOP iff X/X ′ has WDMOP;
(3) is a κ̇-space iff X/X ′ is a k-space;
(4) is a hemi-κ̇ω -space iff X/X ′ is hemicompact;
(5) is a κ̇ω -space iff X/X ′ is a kω -space;
(6) has a countable κ̇-network iff X has a countable k-network.
Proof. Notice that a topological space with unique non-isolated point has DMOP if and only if it has
MOP, then (1) is follows from Theorems 4.4. The implications (2),(4),(5) and (6) follow directly from
Theorems 5.3, 7.4, 8.1 and 9.4, respectively.
(3) Suppose X is a κ̇-space and D ⊂ Ẋ such that for any compact subset K ⊂ X/X ′ , the
intersection D ∩ K is finite. Then for any compact subset K̃ ⊂ X, the intersection D ∩ q(K̃) is finite,
which implies that D ∩ K̃ is finite, so D is closed in X and hence closed in X/X ′ . Consequently,
X/X ′ is κ̇-space. On the other hand, suppose D ⊂ Ẋ such that for any compact subset K̃ ⊂ X,
the intersection D ∩ K̃ is finite. Since q is compact-covering, for every compact subset K ⊂ X/X ′
there exists a compact subset K̃ ⊂ X such that K ⊂ q(K̃). So D ∩ K ⊂ D ∩ q(K̃) is finite, and D
is closed in X/X ′ . It follows that D is closed in X by the definition of quotient map, and hence X is
κ̇-space.

Proposition 12.5(6) allows us to give a partial answer to Problem 9.5.
Corollary 12.6. For any µ̇-space X with a countable κ̇-network X and any regular space Y with a
countable k-network, the function space Ck′ (X, Y ) has a countable k-network.

Proof. By Theorem 12.3, the quotient map q : X → X/X ′ is compact-covering and function spaces
Ck′ (X, Y ) and Ck′ (X/X ′ , Y ) are homeomorphic. By Proposition 12.5(6), the space X/X ′ has a countable k-network. Being a Hausdorff space with a unique non-isolated point, the space X/X ′ is regular.
By a result of Michael [26] (see also [18, 11.5]), the function space Ck (X/X ′ , Y ) has a countable

k-network. Then its subspace Ck′ (X, Y ) has a countable k-network, too.
13. Characterizing stratifiable scattered spaces of finite scattered height
In this section we characterize stratifiable spaces among scattered space of finite scattered height.
A subset A of a topological space X is called
• a retract of X if there exists a continuous map r : X → A such that r(a) = a for all x ∈ A
(this map r is called a retraction of X onto A);
• a Gδ -retract of X, if A is a retract in X and A is a Gδ -subset of X.
Theorem 13.1. A non-discrete topological space X is stratifiable if and only if the set X ′ of nonisolated points of X is a stratifiable space and X ′ is a Gδ -retract of X.
Proof. First, assume that X ′Tis a stratifiable Gδ -retract in X. Fix a retraction r : X → X ′ and write
X ′ as the intersection X ′ = n∈ω Wn of a decreasing sequence (Wn )n∈ω of open sets in X.
By definition, each point x ∈ X ′ of the stratifiable space X ′ has a countable family (Un (x))n∈ω of
T
open neighborhoods such that each closed set F ⊂ X ′ is equal to the intersection n∈ω Un [F ].
For every x ∈ X \ X ′ put Wn (x) = {x} for all n ∈ ω. Also for every x ∈ X ′ and n ∈ ω
put Wn (x) = Wn ∩ r −1 (Un (x)). We claim that the system of neighborhoods (Wn (x))n∈ω x∈X
witnesses
Given any closed subset F ⊂ X, we should prove that
T that the space X is stratifiable.
S
F = n∈ω Wn [F ] where Wn [F ] = x∈F Wn (x). Given any point x ∈
/ F , we should find n ∈ ω such
that x ∈
/ Wn [F ].
If x ∈
/ X ′ , then there exists n ∈ ω such that x ∈
/ Wn . Then the neighborhood {x} of x is disjoint
with the set Wn [F ] ⊂ F ∪ Wn and we are done.
T
/ Un [F ∩ X ′ ]
If x ∈ X ′ , then x ∈
/ F ∩X ′ = n∈ω Un [F ∩ X ′ ]. So, there exists a number n ∈ ω with x ∈
and then x ∈
/ F ∪ r −1 (Un [F ∩ X ′ ]). It remains to observe that
Wn [F ] = F ∪ Wn [F ∩ X ′ ] ⊂ F ∪ r −1 (Un [F ∩ X ′ ]) ⊂ F ∪ r −1 (Un [F ∩ X ′ ])
and Wn [F ] ⊂ F ∪ r −1 (Un [F ∩ X ′ ]) ⊂ X \ {x}. This completes the proof of the “if” part.
To prove the “only if” part, assume that the space X is stratifiable. Since the stratifiability is
inherited by subspaces, X ′ is stratifiable. By definition, each closed subset of a stratifiable space
is a Gδ -set in X, which implies that the closed subset X ′ of X is a Gδ -set in X. It remains to
prove that X ′ is a retract of X. By definition
T of stratifiability, each point x has a countable family
neighborhoods {Un (x)}n∈ω such that F = n∈ω Un [F ] for every closed subset F ⊂ X. We lose no
generality assuming
that U0 (x) = X for any x ∈ X. Replacing each neighborhood Un (x) by the
T
intersection i≤n Ui (x), we can assume that Un+1 (x) ⊂ Un (x) for all n ∈ ω and x ∈ X.
T
T
Since X ′ = n∈ω Un [X ′ ] = n∈ω Un [X ′ ], for every x ∈ Ẋ the set Nx = {n ∈ ω : x ∈ Un [X ′ ]} is
finite and hence has the largest element nx . Choose any point r[x] ∈ X ′ with x ∈ Unx (r[x]). We
claim that the function r : X → X ′ defined by
(
r[x] if x ∈ Ẋ;
r(x) =
x
otherwise;
is a continuous retraction of X onto X ′ .
It suffices to proveTthe continuity of r at any point x′ ∈ X ′ . Take any open neighborhood V ⊂ X
/ Un [X \ V ]. We
of x′ . Then X \ V = n∈ω Un [X \ V ] and there exists a number n ∈ ω such that x′ ∈

32

TARAS BANAKH AND LEIJIE WANG

claim that Ox′ := Un (x′ ) \ Un [X \ V ] is an open neighborhood of x′ such that for any x ∈ Ox′ we get
r(x) ∈ V .
If x ∈ X ′ ∩ Ox′ , then r(x) = x ∈ Ox′ ⊂ X \ Un [X \ V ] ⊂ X \ (X \ V ) = V .
If x ∈ Ẋ, then the inclusion x ∈ Ox′ ⊂ Un (x′ ) ⊂ Un [X ′ ] implies that nx ≥ n and x ∈ Unx (r(x)).
Assuming that r(x) ∈ X \ V , we conclude that x ∈ Unx (r(x)) ⊂ Unx [X \ V ] ⊂ Un [X \ V ], which

contradicts the choice of x ∈ Ox′ ⊂ X \ Un [X \ V ].
Theorem 13.2. A scattered space X of finite scattered height is stratifiable if and only if for every
n < ~[X] the set X [n] is a Gδ -retract in X.
Proof. This characterization will be proved by induction on the scattered height ~[X]. If ~[X] = 0,
then the space X is discrete and hence stratifiable.
Assume that for some n ∈ N we have prove that a scattered space X of scattered height ~[X] < n
is stratifiable if and only if the sets X [k] , k < ~[X], are Gδ -retracts of X.
Let X be a scattered space of scattered height ~[X] = n. If X is stratifiable, then X ′ is a stratifiable
Gδ -retract of X, by Theorem 13.1. Since the space X ′ has scattered height ~[X ′ ] < n we can apply
the inductive assumption and conclude that for every k < ~[X ′ ] the set X [k] is a Gδ -retract in X ′ .
Since X ′ is a Gδ -retract in X, the set X [k] is a Gδ -retract in X.
Now assume that for every k < ~[X] the set X [k] is a Gδ -retract in X. So, there exists a retraction
rk : X → X [k] and X [k] is a Gδ -set in X. Then X [k] is a Gδ -set in X ′ and the restriction rk ↾X ′ : X ′ →
X [k] is a retraction of X ′ onto its closed subset X [k] . So X [k] is a Gδ -retract of X ′ . By the inductive
assumption, the space X ′ is stratifiable. Since X ′ is a Gδ -retract of X, we can apply Theorem 13.1
and conclude that the space X is stratifiable.

14. On function spaces with values in rectifiable pointed spaces
A pointed topological space Y is called a rectifiable space if there exists a homeomorphism H : Y ×
Y → Y × Y such that H({y} × Y ) = {y} × Y and H(y, y) = (y, ∗Y ) for every y ∈ Y . Each topological
group Y is rectifiable because of the homeomorphism H : Y ×Y → Y ×Y , H : (y, z) 7→ (y, y −1 z). The
unit sphere S 7 in the space of Cayley octonions is an example of a rectifiable pointed space, which is
not homeomorphic to a topological group. By [19], a rectifiable space is regular (and metrizable) if
and only if it satisfies the separation axiom T0 (and is first-countable). More information on rectifiable
spaces can be found in [2], [9], [19].
Proposition 14.1. Let Y be a rectifiable space and X be a topological space. If the set X ′ is a retract
of X, then the function space Ck (X, Y ) is homeomorphic to Ck (X ′ , Y ) × Ck′ (X, Y ).
Proof. By the rectifiability of the pointed space Y , there exists a homeomorphism h : Y × Y → Y × Y
such that h({y} × Y ) = {y} × Y and h(y, y) = (y, ∗Y ) for every y ∈ Y . Let pr2 : Y × Y → Y ,
pr2 : (x, y) 7→ y, be the projection onto the second coordinate. Assume that r : X → X ′ is a
retraction of X onto X ′ .
We claim that the map

H : Ck (X, Y ) → Ck (X ′ ) × Ck′ (X, Y ), H : f 7→ f ↾X ′ , pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f ) ,

is a homeomorphism. Here pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f ) : X → Y is the map assigning to each x ∈ X the element
pr2 ◦ h(f ◦r(x), f (x)) ∈ Y . Observe that for any x ∈ X ′ we get
pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r(x), f (x)) = pr2 ◦ h(f (x), f (x)) = pr2 (f (x), ∗Y ) = ∗Y ,
which means that pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f ) ∈ Ck′ (X, Y ).
The map H has a continuous inverse
H −1 : Ck (X ′ , Y ) × Ck′ (X, Y ) → Ck (X, Y ), H −1 : (g, f ) 7→ pr2 ◦ h−1 (g ◦ r, f ),

ON BAIRE CATEGORY PROPERTIES OF FUNCTION SPACES Ck′ (X, Y )

33

where the map pr2 ◦h−1 (g ◦r, f ) : X → Y assigns to each x ∈ X the element pr2 ◦h−1 (g ◦r(x), f (x)) ∈
Y.
To show that H −1 ◦H is the identity map of Ck (X, Y ), take any function f ∈ Ck (X, Y ) and observe
that

H −1 ◦ H(f ) = H −1 f ↾X ′ , pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f ) = pr2 ◦ h−1 ((f ↾X ′ ) ◦ r, pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f )) =
= pr2 ◦ h−1 (f ◦ r, pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f )) = pr2 ◦ h−1 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f ) = pr2 (f ◦ r, f ) = f.

Next, we prove that H ◦ H −1 is the identity map of Ck (X ′ , Y ) × Ck′ (X, Y ). Given any pair (ϕ, ψ) ∈
Ck (X ′ , Y ) × Ck′ (X, Y ), consider the function f = H −1 (ϕ,ψ) = pr2 ◦ h−1 (ϕ ◦ r, ψ). We claim that
H(f ) = (ϕ, ψ). Recall that H(f ) = f ↾X ′ , pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f ) . Then
f ↾X ′ = pr2 ◦ h−1 (ϕ ◦ r, ψ)↾X ′ = pr2 ◦ h−1 (ϕ, ∗Y ) = pr2 (ϕ, ϕ) = ϕ.

On the other hand,

(f ◦ r, pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f )) = h(f ◦ r, f ) = h pr2 ◦ h−1 (ϕ ◦ r, ψ) ◦ r, pr2 ◦ h−1 (ϕ ◦ r, ψ) =


= h pr2 ◦ h−1 (ϕ ◦ r, ∗Y ), pr2 ◦ h−1 (ϕ ◦ r, ψ) = h pr2 (ϕ ◦ r, ϕ ◦ r), pr2 ◦ h−1 (ϕ ◦ r, ψ) =

= h ϕ ◦ r, pr2 ◦ h−1 (ϕ ◦ r, ψ) = h ◦ h−1 (ϕ ◦ r, ψ) = (ϕ ◦ r, ψ)

and hence ψ = pr2 ◦ h(f ◦ r, f ).

15. Function spaces Ck (X, Y ) for scattered X and rectifiable Y
In this section we shall prove (general versions of) the results announced in the introduction.
Theorem 15.1. Let X be a topological space such that X ′ is a Gδ -retract in X and Y 6= {∗Y } be a
second-countable Choquet rectifiable T0 -space. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck (X, Y ) is Baire.
(2) the space X has DMOP and the function space Ck (X ′ , Y ) is Baire.
Proof. By Proposition 14.1, the function space Ck (X, Y ) is homeomorphic to Ck (X ′ , Y ) × Ck′ (X, Y ).
By [19], the second-countable rectifiable T0 -space Y is metrizable and separable. Consequently, Y is
∗-first-countable. Since Y 6= {∗Y }, the metrizable space Y is ∗-admissible.
(1) ⇒ (2) Assume that the function space Ck (X, Y ) is Baire. Since the Baire space Ck (X, Y ) is
homeomorphic to Ck′ (X, Y ) × Ck (X ′ , Y ), the spaces Ck′ (X, Y ) and Ck (X ′ , Y ) are Baire. By Corollary 4.6, the space X has DMOP.
(2) ⇒ (1) Assume that the space X has DMOP and the function space Ck (X ′ , Y ) is Baire. By
Corollary 4.6, the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Baire. By our assumption, X ′ is a Gδ -set in X. By Proposition 3.2, the space Ck′ (X, Y ) has countable cellularity. By Theorem 3.1 of [24], the product of a Baire
space and a countably cellular Baire space is Baire. Consequently, the product Ck (X ′ , Y ) × Ck′ (X, Y )
is Baire and so is its topological copy Ck (X, Y ).

Applying Theorem 15.1 inductively, we can prove the following characterization.
Corollary 15.2. Let n ∈ N and X be a topological space such that for every k ≤ n the set X [k] is a
Gδ -retract in X. Then for any second-countable Choquet rectifiable T0 -space Y 6= {∗Y }, the following
conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck (X, Y ) is Baire;
(2) for every i ≤ n the space X [i] has DMOP and the space Ck (X [n] , Y ) is Baire.
Combining Corollary 15.2 with Theorem 13.2, we obtain the following characterization.
Corollary 15.3. For any stratifiable scattered space X of finite scattered height and any secondcountable Choquet rectifiable space Y 6= {∗Y }, the following conditions are equivalent:

34

TARAS BANAKH AND LEIJIE WANG

(1) the function space Ck (X, Y ) is Baire;
(2) for every k < ~[X] the space X [k] has DMOP.
Corollary 15.4. For a stratifiable scattered space X of finite scattered height the following conditions
are equivalent:
(1) The function space Ck (X) is Baire.
(2) The space X has MOP.
(3) For every n < ~[X] the space X [n] has DMOP.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) If the function space Ck (X) is Baire, then the space X has MOP by Theorem 2.1
in [17].
(2) ⇒ (3) If X has MOP, then each closed subspace of X has MOP. In particular, for every
k < ~[X] the closed subspace X [k] has MOP and hence has DMOP (because MOP implies DMOP).
The implication (3) ⇒ (1) follows from Corollary 15.3 since the real line is a rectifiable Choquet
space.

Analogous result can be proved for the Choquet property.
Theorem 15.5. Let X 6= X ′ be a topological space such that X ′ is a retract of X and Y 6= {∗Y } be
a second-countable rectifiable T0 -space. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck (X, Y ) is Choquet;
(2) the spaces Y and Ck (X ′ , Y ) are Choquet and the space X has WDMOP.
Proof. By Proposition 14.1, the function space Ck (X, Y ) is homeomorphic to Ck (X ′ , Y ) × Ck′ (X, Y ).
(1) ⇒ (2) Assume that the function space Ck (X, Y ) is Choquet. Since the Choquet space Ck (X, Y )
is homeomorphic to Ck′ (X, Y ) × Ck (X ′ , Y ), the spaces Ck′ (X, Y ) and Ck (X ′ , Y ) are Choquet, being
open continuous images of Ck (X, Y ). By Theorem 5.3, the space X has WDMOP.
(2) ⇒ (1) Assume that Y is Choquet, X has WDMOP and function space Ck (X ′ , Y ) is Choquet. By Theorem 5.3, the space Ck′ (X, Y ) is Choquet. Then the space Ck (X, Y ) is Choquet, being

homeomorphic to the product Ck′ (X, Y ) × Ck (X ′ , Y ) of two Choquet spaces.
This theorem has the following corollaries.
Corollary 15.6. Let n ∈ N and X 6= X ′ be a topological space such that for every k ≤ n the set
X [k] is a retract of X. Then for any second-countable rectifiable T0 -space Y 6= {∗Y }, the following
conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck (X, Y ) is Choquet;
(2) the spaces Y and Ck (X [n] , Y ) are Choquet, and for every k ≤ n the space X [k] has WDMOP.
Corollary 15.7. For any non-empty stratifiable scattered space of finite scattered height and any
second-countable rectifiable T0 -space Y =
6 {∗Y }, the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) the function space Ck (X, Y ) is Choquet;
(2) Y is Choquet and for every k < ~[X] the space X [k] has WDMOP.
Corollary 15.8. For any stratifiable scattered space X of finite scattered height the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) The function space Ck (X) is Choquet.
(2) For every n < ~[X] the space X [n] has WDMOP.
