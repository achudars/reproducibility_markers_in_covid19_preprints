A non-perturbative calculation of the effective thermal potential between heavy Q and Q̄ from
lattice QCD is difficult, and usually involves a Bayesian analysis. Here we present a simple
method to obtain the potential from smeared Wilson loop, using the structure of the thermal
Wilson loop. We present results for the QQ̄ thermal potential in a gluonic plasma for temperatures
. 2Tc . We also present preliminary results for the effective potential when the Q and Q̄ are in
octet color configuration.

Non-perturbative thermal potential

1. Introduction
Quarkonium is an important probe of quark-gluon plasma formation in relativistic heavy ion
collision experiments. One can define an effective “thermal potential” to understand the medium
modification of quarkonia [1]. The thermal potential plays an important role in the treatment of
in-medium quarkonia as open quantum system [2]. To define the potential at finite temperature
consider the real time QQ̄ operator, M(r = |~x −~y|,t) = ψ̄ (~x,t)U (~x,~y;t)ψ (~y,t). In the static limit,
the forward correlation function of this operator c(r,t) = hM(r,t) M † (r, 0)i becomes proportional to
a rectangular real time Wilson loop w(r,t). The static potential is defined as [1]

∂ loghw(r,t)i

(1.1)

Eqn. (1.1) has been calculated in leading order HTL perturbation theory. It gives a complex
potential: V (r) = VTre (r) − iVTim (r), with VTre (r) the usual Debye-screened Coulomb potential and

Here T denotes the temperature, and mD is the Debye mass.
On the lattice we can only calculate Euclidean-time Wilson loop wE (r, τ ), defined in the time
interval τ = [0, β = 1/T ). This can be connected to the real-time Wilson loop w(r,t) through a
spectral function ρ (ω ) [3],

(1.3)

w(r,t) can be constructed by taking Fourier transform of ρ (ω ). On lattice obtaining ρ (ω ) is very
difficult problem as we have only small number of data points along the temporal direction.
There have been attempts to calculate ρ (ω ) using various Bayesian analysis methods. Maximum Entropy method was used in Ref. [3]; however the potential obtained there was not screened
above Tc . Also the quality of signal for Wilson loop deteriorates very fast with the size of the loop.
To improve the signal, we have used multilevel algorithm, slicing the lattice in τ direction, and
used APE smeared spatial links in the construction of the Wilson loop. If a suitable potential can
be defined, it should not depend on the smearing of the spatial link; we have checked this by using various levels of smearing. In the literature Coulomb gauge fixed Wilson line correlators have
often been used to extract the potential. Bayesian reconstruction of such a correlator has shown a
screened potential, and the imaginary part of the potential has also been obtained [4]. However the
results have large errors [4]. There are also studies using the method of moments and making some
ansatz for the form of ρ (ω ) [5].
We use a different analysis method, using the structure of the Wilson loop; our method will
be described in the next section. In Sec. 3 we will show the results for the potential for gluonic
plasma. More details regarding these can be found in Ref. [6].
For QGP phenomenology, one needs the thermal potential not only between QQ̄ in the singlet
channel, but also when they are in an octet color configuration. The octet potential is also a necessary ingredient for the open quantum system approach [2]. In Sec. 4 we discuss the interaction
potential between the static Q and Q̄ in a color-octet configuration.

2. Method
At zero temperature hwE (r, τ ; T = 0)i ∼ e−V (r)τ at large τ ; as a result one would see a plateau in
E (r,τi )i
the effective mass me f f (r, τi ) = log hwhwE (r,
τi +1)i . V (r) determined from lattice is qualitatively similar
to the Cornell potential. However at finite temperature above Tc there is no plateau in the effective
mass. Given that VT (r) is expected to have an imaginary part [1], one should not expect a plateau
either.
Motivated from HTL perturbation theory, we split wE (r, τ ) as:

Let us first focus on the anti-periodic part A(r, τ ) = 12 log hwhw

mass m(r, τ ) and (βA(r,
/2−τ ) . From the figure it is clear that non-perturbatively also A(r, τ ) is linear in

τ around β /2. For the remaining part, P(r, τ ) = 21 log(hwE (r, τ )ihwE (r, β − τ )i), we can again take
help from perturbation theory and write it as
P(r, τ ) =

d ω σ (ω ) (e−ωτ + e−ω (β −τ ) + τ independent parts).

(2.2)

Now to have a potential i∂t P(r, it) should approach a constant as t goes to infinity.
i∂t P(r, it) =

−∞

(e−iω t − e−ω (β −it) ) ω σ (ω ) d ω .

(2.3)

Therefore we need σ (ω ) to go like σ (ω ) ∼ ω12 as ω approaches zero. On the right panel of Fig. 1
we have shown a fit of ∂τ P(r, τ ) calculated from lattice data with the leading ω12 behaviour. We can
see that almost the entire range of τ can be fitted with this leading singular structure.

One of the 1/ω in 1/ω 2 comes from a factor 1 + nb (ω ), where nb (ω ) is the Bose distribution function [1]. This can be understood from the structure of the time-ordered correlator [6].

Non-perturbative thermal potential

Only the odd terms are present because the even ones do not contribute to Eq. (2.2). A very good
fit of the data can also be found just by using two terms in the series. The potential is obtained from
the coefficient of 1/ω in the expansion, as only this term contributes in the long time t limit. Using
Eq. (2.4) one would then get

Our strategy for calculating potential is then obvious: we do a linear fit of A(r, τ ) near β /2 to
get the real part of the potential and the imaginary part can be obtained by fitting Eq. (2.5) More
details on the analysis can be found in [6].

3. Results for singlet channel
We show here the results of the singlet potential obtained from anisotropic lattices with coupling β = 6.64 and the bare anisotropy ξb = 2.55, which corresponds to a renormalized anisotropy
ξ = 3 and a spatial lattice spacing of 0.048 fm. For results with other lattice parameters and discussion of cutoff effects see [6]. The spatial volume was kept fixed at 1.44 fm, and temperatures upto 2
Tc were explored by varying the temporal extent Nt . We used APE smearing for the spatial links of
the Wilson loop. The potential was calculated with various number of smearing steps, where each

In Fig. 2 we have plotted the real and imaginary parts of the potential as a function of the
number of smearing sweeps for T = 1.5Tc . From the figure it is clear that the potential has very
minor dependence on the smearing after a certain number of smearing. Anyway for the calculation
of error we have included the variation with respect to smearing as a systematic error. When
quoting the value of imaginary part the error also includes the variation of the fit results when we
change the number of terms in Eq. (2.4).
In Fig. 3 we show the temperature dependence of the singlet potential. VTre (r), shown in the
left panel, shows a clear screening behavior above Tc . At a temperature of 0.75 Tc VTre (r) shows the

usual linear string tension behavior at long distances. Above Tc this linear rise is screened, with
the screening increasing with temperature. However, quantitatively the potential is different from
the screened Coulomb form; addition of a screened string tension term [7] is needed to fit VTre (r) at
these temperatures.
On the right hand side we have plotted VTim (r). The results below Tc are consistent with zero
and are not shown in the plot. Above Tc , VTim (r) is very different from the perturbative results of
Ref. [1]. It is also seen to increase with rise in temperature. More details about the temperature
dependence and parametrization of VTim (r) can be found in Ref. [6].

4. Results for octet channel
For phenomenology of quarkonia in QGP, one also needs to understand the interaction between
Q and Q̄ when they are in a color octet configuration. In analogy with the singlet state, we can try to
define a potential using the point-split operator ψ̄ (~x,t)U (~x,~x0 ;t)TaU (~x0 ,~y;t)ψ (~y,t) [8]. This state,
however, is not gauge invariant.
A gauge invariant state with the quark content of the above operator can be formed by adding
a color-adjoint gluonic operator Ha [9]:
O(r = |~x −~y|,t;~x0 ) = ψ̄ (~x,t)U (~x,~x0 ;t)Ta Ha (~x0 ,t)U (~x0 ,~y;t)ψ (~y,t).

(4.1)

Taking the above source will, in the static limit, lead to Wilson loop with inserted Ta Ha (~x0 ) at both
initial and final time slices. Here we take two operators, Bza and Bxa + iBya , for Ha , where the quark
and the antiquark are taken to be separated in the z direction. These are the hybrid states with
gluonic angular momentum L = 0 and L = 1 along z direction for Bza and Bxa + iBya respectively. The
results shown in this section are from Wilson loops with 200 steps of smearing for spatial links.
In the left panel of Fig. 4 we show the octet potential at the temperature of 0.75 Tc . For comparison, the singlet potential at this temperature is also shown. As with the singlet channel, below
Tc the potential is largely insensitive to temperature and closely resembles the zero temperature
potential. In leading order perturbation theory these hybrid potentials at short distances only get
contribution from octet channel, and the potential is independent of Ha [9] at short distance. However, at long distance the potential depends on Ha [9], leading to different hybrid potentials for the
L = 0 and L = 1 channels.

Figure 4: Singlet and “octet” potentials between static Q and Q̄ below (left, at 0.75 Tc ) and above (right) the
deconfinement transition temperature.

At finite temperature we have calculated the real part of the potential for the state O(r,t) using
the method of Sec. 2. The plateau structure here is not as good as that of the singlet, however the
real part of the potential can be obtained by fitting a few points near β /2. Preliminary results for
the potential are shown in the right panel of Fig. 4. Here we find that the potential is identical for
the two choices of Ha we have used. This suggests that at finite temperature the effect of Ha gets
decoupled from the potential at all distances, and we can meaningfully talk about the real part of
the effective thermal potential for octet QQ̄. Of course, it would be good to further check this with
other choices of the gluonic operator.
In the figure we have also shown VTre (r) for the singlet potential, at the same temperatures. As
the figure shows, the octet and singlet potential approach each other at long distances. At higher
temperatures they approach each other at shorter distances. We stress that we did not add any
additive renormalization constant to the octet potential to match with singlet: as the effect of Ha
gets decoupled, the renormalization of the octet gets fixed once the additive renormalization for the
singlet is fixed.
At short distances, the singlet and octet potentials are attractive and repulsive, respectively,
consistent with perturbation theory. To further investigate conformity with perturbation theory
without having to worry about the additive renormalization constant, we define [10] δ Vo,s (r) =
Vo,s (r + as ) −Vo,s (r), where o, s stand for octet and singlet, respectively. In leading order of perturbation theory, δ Vs (r) = −8δ Vo (r). The nonperturbative estimates, shown in Fig. 5, agree with this
prediction within our errorbars.

5. Summary
Extraction of a thermal potential from the Euclidean time Wilson loop is difficult and often
involves Bayesian analysis. Here we calculate the complex “thermal potential” [1] using various
properties of Wilson loops, motivated from perturbation theory; the method is described in Sec.
2. We have discussed results for the singlet potential in Sec. 3. On crossing Tc , the linear confining part of the real part of the potential is screened, the screening increasing with increase in
temperature. However, at least upto temperatures of 2 Tc the singlet VTre (r) is different from the
perturbative potential. In the deconfined phase, the effective potential also acquires an imaginary

part. The imaginary part is very different from the perurbative result, with the potential not saturating upto the distance scale rTc ∼ 1.4, or r ∼ 1 fm. We have also studied the effective thermal
potential between the Q and Q̄ in an octet configuration. Preliminary results for the real part of the
potential are discussed in Sec. 4. Our results indicate that, unlike at zero temperature, the thermal
potential between hybrid states is not sensitive to the gluonic structure in O(r), Eq. (4.1). While at
short distances the octet potential is repulsive, at long distances it approaches the singlet potential.
Qualitatively the potential is similar to the free energy for the octet state [11].
