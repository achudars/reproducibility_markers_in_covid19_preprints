The optimal success probability of a communication game sets fundamental limitations on an operational
theory. Quantum advantage of parity oblivious random access code (PORAC), a communication game, over
classical resources reveals the preparation contextuality of quantum theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 010401
(2009)]. Optimal quantum advantage in the N-dit PORAC game for finite dimensions is an open problem. Here,
we show that the degree of uncertainty allowed in an operational theory determines the amount of preparation
contextuality. We connect the upper bound of fine-grained uncertainty relation to the success probability of
PORAC game played with the quantum resource. Subsequently, we find the optimal success probability for the
2-dit PORAC game using MUBs for the decoding strategy. Finally, we also derive an upper bound on quantum
advantage for the N-dit PORAC game.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum physics has several fundamental no go theorems,
which reveals how radically it deviates from classical physics.
Bell theorem states that quantum theory cannot be reproduced
by a local realist model [1, 2]. On the other hand, the BellKochen-Specker theorem asserts that quantum theory is contextual [3, 4]. It means that the observables cannot be assigned
definite values, independent of the setting in which they are
measured, i.e., the context. Later, the notion of contextuality
was generalized so that it can be associated with any operational theory [5].
These no go theorems arise out of quantum correlations[2].
In the context of spatial correlation, it is known that nonlocality of a theory is not enough so that it allows signaling [6].
Quantum correlation between space-like separated measurements is restricted by the Cirelson type bound [7]. Subsequently, it was asked whether there are some physical principles which limit the amount of nonlocality. There are approaches from information theory [8, 9], communication complexity [10, 11], local quantum mechanics [12] to address this
question. In Ref.[13], the authors took a very different approach i.e., they relate the limit of nonlocality with two inherent properties of any physical theory called, uncertainty [14]
and steerability [15–17].
Initially, uncertainty relations were stated in terms of product of standard deviations lower bounded by some quantity related with commutators of the observables measured [14, 18].
Later, entropic uncertainty relations were introduced which
are state-independent [19, 20]. However, entropic measures
depict uncertainty in a coarse way as it does not capture uncertainty in the realization of different outcomes distributions
for multiple measurements. To circumvent this, fine-grained
uncertainty relation(FUR) was introduced, which is a set of
inequalities, one for each possible combination of outcomes
[13]. Later this inequality was generalized for higher dimensional systems for mutually unbiased bases (MUB) [21].

Fundamental limiting features of a theory has been often
studied through the ability of some communication games to
process information [9, 22]. Random access code (RAC) is a
two-player communication game [23, 24], a party, say, Alice
holding a data set in the form of n-bit string, encodes it in a
state and sends to another party Bob whose task is to guess
any one of the bit randomly chosen from the string(see Fig.1).
The generalization of bits to higher dimensions is dits. A bit
refers to a two-level system whereas dit is a d level system.
Therefore, instead of a n-bit string, Alice can also encode an
n-dit string in a state and send it to Bob, who then tries to
guess a dit from the string [25].
An interesting connection between an RAC game and contextuality was made by Spekkens et al.[26], invoking the parity obliviousness constraint. The constraint of parity obliviousness in an RAC game demands that encoding is such that
the receiver can not know the parity of the incoming signal
x from the sender. One of the ways of defining the parity of
message x is the sum (mod d) of the bit values contained in
the message. If parity obliviousness constraint is imposed on
the RAC game, which we discuss in detail in the main text,
then optimal success probability of winning with classical resources coincides with that when resources are taken from
noncontextual theory. Therefore, the quantum advantage of
parity oblivious random access code (PORAC) game implies
the preparation contextuality of quantum theory. It was also
shown that preparation contextuality leads to nonlocality [27–
30]. Following this notion connection has been made with
PORAC game and other nonlocal games [30–32] and optimal
quantum bound follows from the Cirelson like bound associated with nonlocality [7]. To reveal preparation contextuality,
PORAC game was studied for higher-dimensional single systems and experimental realization was demonstrated as well
[26, 33, 34]. Optimal quantum advantage of PORAC game
was derived when n-bit classical information is encoded in
higher dimensional systems [32]. Up to a few dimension,
maximal quantum violation of preparation noncontextuality
inequality was also derived numerically in [33]. In general
finding optimal quantum bound for high-level PORAC game
or maximal quantum violation of non-contextuality inequality
is an open question.
Here we show that the degree of uncertainty, which is a

2
property of a theory, determines how much a theory would be
preparation contextual. Specifically, we derive tight FUR for
any pair of measurements for any finite dimension and show
the upper bound of the FUR is closely related with the quantum advantage of PORAC game in terms of enhanced success probability over classical strategy. We, then prove that
the optimal quantum bound is reached when Alice encodes
n-dit string in a qudit states which are the maximal certain
states with respect to a set of MUBs, while Bob’s decoding
strategy is to perform those MUBs. We further show optimal
encoding-decoding strategy thus determined by FUR also satisfies the parity obliviousness constraint. Finally, we compare
some results regarding maximal quantum bound obtained previously, with our result for the sake of completeness.

II. PREPARATION NONCONTEXTUALITY FROM
PARITY OBLIVIOUS RANDOM ACCESS CODES

Preparation non-contextuality associated with an operational theory was first introduced in [5]. An operational theory
provides the probabilities p(k|P, M ) of getting an outcome
k given the preparation procedure P , and the measurement
M . Quantum theory is also an operational theory in which
a preparation procedure P is represented by ρP and a measurement is represented by a positive operator valued measure
(POVM), ΛM,k . The probability of getting an outcome k is
p(k|P, M ) = Tr(ρP ΛM,k ).
An operational theory is said to be preparation noncontextual if two preparations yield the same measurement
statistics for all possible measurements implies probability associated with two different preparations at the hidden variable
level(λ) is also same, i.e,
∀M ∀k; p(k|P, M ) = p(k|P 0 , M ) =⇒ p(λ|P ) = p(λ|P 0 )
(1)
where λ is a hidden variable and P and P 0 denote two preparation procedures.
Preparation contextuality was demonstrated using parity
oblivious communication games [26, 33]. In the game, Alice receives an N -dit string x ∈ {0, 1, ..., d − 1}N , which
she encodes in a state ρx and then sends it to Bob, chosen
uniformly. Whereas, Bob’s task is to guess the y th bit of the
string x, using his measurement outcome b obtained by a set
of measurements Y, as shown in Fig.1. There is a cryptographic constraint that Alice can encode her message under
the parity obliviousness condition that no information about
the parity of x can be revealed to Bob. If s ∈ P ar where
P ar ≡ {s|s ∈ {0, 1, .., d − 1}N , ζ ≤ d − 2}, with ζ denoting the number of zeroes appearing in a particular s, then no
information about x · s = ⊕i xi si ( mod d) = l, ∀l ≤ d − 1
should be revealed to Bob. We refer to this task as N → 1
d-Parity oblivious random access codes (d-PORACs). The
parity obliviousness condition, for the set of measurements Y
performed by Bob, can be cast down in the form of following

b
FIG. 1: (Color online) In this communication game, Alice
encodes the classical string x ∈ {0, 1, ..., d − 1}N in state ρx .
On recieving the state ρx Bob’s performs a measurement Xi
chosen uniformly from a set of N observables, and tries to
guess the y th dit of x using his measurement outcome b.
Given the obliviousness constraint Bob’s task is to maximize the average success probability of reporting the correct
output b = xy . The average probability of guessing the correct bit is given by

Different operational theories provide different maximal success probability of the game. It was shown in [33] that an
operational theory which admits a preparation non-contextual

FINE-GRAINED UNCERTAINTY RELATIONS

Suppose, we want to measure N different observables Xi ,
where i ∈ {1, ..., N }, and outcomes xi ∈ {0, ..., d − 1}.
One can quantify the uncertainty associated with the measurements using entropic uncertainty relations as following
N
X
i=1

H(Xi )ρ ≥ β,

3
where β depends on the compatibility between different observables. However, entropy is a coarse way of measuring the
uncertainty and incompatibility of a set of measurements. It
does not reflect the uncertainty inherent in obtaining a particular combination of outcomes xi for different measurements
Xi . To circumvent this issue, fine-grained uncertainty relation
was proposed in Ref.[13]. The uncertainty relation is a set of
dN inequalities of the following form
P cert (ρ, x) =

N
X

p(Xi )p(xi |Xi )ρ ≤ Cx (O, P),

(4)

i=1

where Cx (O, P) depends on the particular combination of
measurement outcomes from a set of observables O = {Xi }
and chosen with distribution function P = {p(Xi )}. For the
set of observables O = {Xi }, the state which saturates Eq.(4),
is a maximally certain state for these observables. The quantity Cx (O, P) captures the amount of uncertainty allowed in
a particular physical theory. If Cx (O, P) < 1 for any x, one
cannot obtain any outcome with certainty. Later, in Ref.[21]
FUR were generalized for mutually unbiased bases (MUBs)
in d dimensional systems. For a set of N mutual unbiased
bases(MUBs) chosen with equal probability, the inequalities

Tight fine-grained uncertainty relations for two arbitrary
observables in arbitrary dimension

For two d− dimensional observables X1 and X2 , we can
prove the following fine-grained inequalities corresponding to
combination of outcomes x1 and x2 respectively.

X1 and X2 respectively on the state ρ has the following form

and |x2 i corresponding to outcomes x1 and x2 respectively,
the following inequality exists
Arccoshx1 iρ + Arccoshx2 iρ ≥ Arccos|hx1 |x2 i|.

(8)

Note that Tr(|x1 ihx1 |ρ) = hx1 i2ρ and similarly for
From Eq.(8), we have
Tr(|x2 ihx2 |ρ) = hx2 i2ρ .
Arccoshx2 iρ ≤ Arccos|hx1 |x2 i| − Arccoshx1 iρ . We denote
Arccoshx1 iρ = α and Arccos|hx1 |x2 i| = θ and substitute this
inequality in the left-hand side term of Eq.(7).

VIOLATING NON-CONTEXTUALITY INEQUALITY
WITH FINE-GRAINED UNCERTAINTY

In this section, we show how FUR determines the preparation contextuality of quantum theory. As previously stated,
there exist dN such inequalities for N mutually unbiased observables Eq.(9). If we take the average over all such inequalities for N = 2, we obtain

where xi ∈ {0, 1, ..., d − 1} are the measurement outcomes
corresponding to observable Xi . If Alice encodes the classical
string x by preparing ρx , and sends to Bob, who measures Xi
to guess the ith bit of x, then L.H.S of inequality Eq.(10) becomes the success probability of 2 → 1 d RAC game. Now,
R.H.S of inequality Eq.(10) gives the quantum upper bound
for the success probability of the game. Later we also show
that such encoding and decoding scheme also respects the parity obliviousness condition, with respect to Bob’s choice of
measurements. Now, we state our result in terms of a theorem
when Bob performs measurement with MUBs.

Preparation contextuality via 2→ 1 d PORAC game

Using a 2→ 1 d RAC game one can demonstrate preparation contextuality on the basis of the following theorem.
Theorem 3: In an RAC game, if Alice encodes the 2-dit classical string x in quantum states, which are maximally certain states for Bob’s set of measurements (which are MUBs),
then the preparation contextuality of quantum theory can be
revealed. Moreover, this encoding-decoding strategy, guided
by fine-grained uncertainty relations for MUBs satisfies Parity
obliviousness condition, given by Eq.(2) for 2 → 1 d-PORAC.
Demonstrating preparation contextual nature with an encoding and decoding scheme requires two things: 1) The RAC
game should satisfy the parity obliviousness condition and 2)
The success probability should be greater than that obtained
in a non-contextual theory. First, we will show that our encoding and decoding scheme respects the parity obliviousness
condition, given a set of measurements performed by Bob.
Proof. 2 → 1 d-RAC game has d sets of different parity
and the number of classical message, x = x0 x1 , in each set
are d. We follow the encoding and decoding scheme presented in [25] for a d−level Quantum random access code
game(QRAC), and show that their scheme is parity oblivious
and can be derived from fine-grained inequalities for MUBs.
To detect the message x0 x1 we use mutually unbiased basis given by the computational basis {|pi}p and fourier basis
Pd−1
ep = √1d q ω pq |qi, where ω = exp( 2πi
d ). Alice encodes
the classical signal x0 x1 = 00 in the state |ψ00 i = N1d (|0i +
q
|e0 i) where Nd = 2 + √2d . For the two projectors |0i and
|e0 i, this state is the maximally certain state, i.e., it saturates
the fine-grained inequality in Eq.(9). Similarly, for other signals we use the encoding state as |ψx0 x1 i = X x0 Z x1 |ψ00 i,
Pd−1
Pd−1 q
where X =
q=0 |q + 1ihq| and Z =
q=0 ω |qihq| are
the unitary operators. To learn about the first bit x0 Bob will
do the measurement in the computational basis and he will
do measurement in the Fourier basis to learn about x1 . Given
this encoding and decoding scheme, the success probability of
Bob for determining the x0 and x1 bit is given by

Bob’s prediction is correct when either p = x0 for Px0 and

turns out to be

. Thus, it also saturates the fine

grained inequality for the measurements in {|pi} basis and
{|ep i} basis. We note that since the success probability of
Px0 is independent of the dit at position x1 and similarly the
success probability Px1 is independent of dit x0 , our encoding
and decoding scheme is parity oblivious in this scenario.
Next, we will show that the success probability in our
encoding and decoding scheme exceeds the non-contextual
bound of a PORAC.
Proof. The maximum success probability of the 2 → 1 dlevel RAC game in quantum theory is exactly the R.H.S of the
Eq.(10). On comparing the upper bound of N → 1 d PO√
RAC game with that of FUR, we find that d1 1 + d−1

2+d−1
= d 1 + 2 . Therefore, we have obtained a viola2d
tion of the preparation non-contextuality inequality.
It should be noted that a full set of MUBs for an arbitrary dimension d is not known. But in the 2→ 1 d PORAC game, we
need only 2 such observables of dimension d for our scheme
to work.
Example-1 First we present the simplest example of a 2 →
1, 2-PORAC. Although this has been presented earlier [26],
we only highlight how the fine-grained uncertainty relations
comes in the picture. The classical signal
 {00,01,10,11}
 are

encoded in the states with Bloch vectors 0, ± √12 , ± √12 , because for σx and σy these states saturate the fine-grained uncertainty relation. To decode the signal Bob measures with
σx to measure the first bit and with σy to measure the second bit. Usingthis method
 he detects the correct signal with
1
1
3
probability 2 1 + √2 = 0.8535553 ≥ n+1
2n = 4 , and
thus violates the inequality in Eq.(3). The parity obliviousness condition is also respected, since the parity 0 and 1
states are represented by the same density matrix operator,i.e.,
1
1
1
1
I
2 ρ00 + 2 ρ11 = 2 ρ10 + 2 ρ01 = 2 . Thus, by using the fine
grained uncertainty relation we obtain a violation of preparation non-contextuality.
Example-2 In [25], the authors have found a violation
of 2 → 1 RAC game analytically as well as numerically.

The analytical value of success probability is 12 1 + √13 =
0.788675. As we have shown, their encoding and decoding
scheme is parity oblivious also.

In the 3 → 1, 2−PORAC game, Alice encodes the classical
signal {000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111} in qubit quantum
states and sends them to Bob. Following the fine-grained inequalityin Eq.(6), if Aliceencodes them states with Bloch
vectors ± √13 , ± √13 , ± √13 , which saturate the fine-grained
uncertainty for 3 observables σx , σy and σz with mutually unbiased bases. Bob employs σx ,σy and σz operators to detect
the first, second and thirdbit respectively
and obtains correct

signal with probability 12 1 + √13 = 0.788675 ≥ n+1
2n = 3 .
It has been shown that this encoding scheme is also parity
oblivious [26]. Moreover, this is the optimal success probability for this game Refs.[30, 32].
Now, we find an upper bound of the quantum violation of
preparation non-contextuality inequality.
Theorem 4: Encoding-decoding strategy based on FUR for
MUBs gives the upper bound of quantum violation of preparation the non-contextuality inequality, specifically, it gives an
upper bound of success probability of quantum theory in the
N → 1 d-PORAC game, in which decoding is done using
rank-one projective measurements.
We prove Theorem 4 in Appendix B.

CONCLUSION

The optimal success probability of certain communication
games reveal the fundamental limitations of different operational theories. Quantum advantage of random access code
game with the additional constraint of parity obliviousness
asserts that quantum theory is preparation contextual. Here
we show the degree of contextuality of a theory is limited by
the amount of uncertainty allowed in a theory. To show this,
we have derived an upper bound for fine-grained uncertainty
relations of N arbitrary observables of dimension d. In addition, we have also found tight fine-grained inequalities for
two observable, which provide optimal encoding and decoding strategy for 2 → 1 d-PORAC. Subsequently, we find analytically the quantum violation of the preparation contextuality inequality for the 2 → 1 d-PORAC game. Some partial results of optimal violations were known up to a few dimension
with the help of numerical methods i.e., semidefinite programming [31]. Our results are derived under the condition that the
dimension of the resource states corresponding to d-PORAC
game is also d in classical or quantum theory. In future, one
can try to find the violation of preparation non-contextuality
for N → 1 d-PORAC games, for N > 2 also.

Here, we will prove Theorem 4, and find the maximal success probability of a N → 1 d-PORAC game, over all possible
measurement settings. The success probability of the N →1

where we have not specified the measurement setting chosen
by Bob. For any arbitrary measurement performed by Bob,
p(xi |Xi )ρ = d1 + 2x~i · ~b, where x~i is the bloch vector corresponding to the outcome xi , where ~b is the bloch vector of
encoding state. For optimal encoding it will depend on the
x~i ’s, which we will prove now. Substituting this probability
in the above equation we get
