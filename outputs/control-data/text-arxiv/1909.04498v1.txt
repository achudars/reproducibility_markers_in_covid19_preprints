Abstract
We present the results of XMM-Newton observations toward the pulsar PSR J1826−1256,
which lies at 50 .4 from the centroid of the TeV source HESS J1826−130. These data show
an elongated nebula with the pulsar located in the northern border with the emission in
the direction of the peak of the very high energy source. The spectral study of the X-ray
emission shows a clear softening of the photon index with increasing distance from the
pulsar. We discuss the connection among the pulsar, its nebula, and the HESS source.

Introduction

The pulsar PSR J1826−1256, one of the brightest radio-quiet γ-ray pulsars, is surrounded
by diffuse and weak X-ray emission of nonthermal origin. It was suggested that this emission
detected with Chandra could come from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR
J1826−1256, named G18.5−0.4 or “Eel” PWN (Roberts et al., 2007). PSR J1826−1256 is
seen projected 50 .4 away from the centroid of the TeV source HESS J1826−130, which is
a newly-unidentified extended TeV source, previously hidden within the emission from the
bright nearby PWN HESS J1825−137 (H. E. S. S. Collaboration et al., 2018). In this paper,
we present a new X-ray study with the aim to confirm the nature of the X-ray emission
around PSR J1826−1256 and investigate its connection with HESS J1826−130 in order to
unveil the origin of the γ-ray emission.

Observations and Results
X-ray emission

The X-ray image and spectra toward PSR J1826−1256 were obtained by processing unpublished archival XMM-Newton data. The MOS1 and MOS2 cameras were set in the full-frame

mode and hence mapped the full extension of the nebula, while the PN camera was operated
in the small-window mode, which covers a small region around PSR J1826−1256. The two
MOS cameras were used for the analysis of the X-ray while the three cameras for the spectral
study of the pulsar. The data were processed using software packages SAS 16.1.0 and Heasoft
6.22.1 following standard procedures.
Figure 1 shows the new XMM-Newton image toward PSR J1826−1256 in the energy
range 1 to 7 keV. This image reveals considerable new structures and diffuse emission not
detected in the previous study performed on the basis of Chandra data. The bulk of the
emission comes from an elongated feature with an elliptical shape of about 60 × 20 , which is
brighter around the pulsar and extends toward the southwest in the direction of the centroid
of the HESS 1826−130 TeV source. The elongated feature is surrounded by faint and diffuse
emission that is more prominent toward the southeast.
To obtain the overall properties of the X-ray emission, the spectrum was extracted from
the entire source. The background was chosen from a circular region free of diffuse emission
and excluding the point sources over it. The spectral points were simultaneously fit in the 1-7
keV energy band with an absorbed power-law model (wabs+powerlaw ). On the other hand,
the spectrum of PSR J1826−1256 is also well fitted with an absorbed power-law model. We
noted that the absorbing column density turns out to be similar to that obtained for the

extended emission, as expected if they are associated sources.
We searched for spectral variations of the photon index along the diffuse emission and
found a spectral steeping with increasing from 1.6 to 2.7 with the distance to the pulsar, a
behaviour observed in several Galactic PWNe, and consistent with synchrotron cooling of
electrons.

The connection with HESS J1826−130

In a search for possible associations with HESS J1826−130, the PSR J1826−1256 and its
nebula appear as the most plausible candidates. In a leptonic scenario the TeV emission
is expected to arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering between the ambient low-energy
photons and the same population of electron producing synchrotron radiation in the keV
band. Assuming that the softening of the spectrum with the distance from the pulsar is due
to cooling effects and the cosmic microwave background is the main source of background
photons with a temperature of 3 K, we roughly estimate the energy of the TeV photons
produced by IC scattering. The obtained a value is lower than 30 TeV, compatible withe the
detection of γ-ray in the 0.5 - 40 TeV range from HESS J1826−130 (Angüner et al., 2017).
In this way we suggest that the very high emission is likely produced by the PWN powered
by PSR J1826−1256 via the inverse Compton mechanism.

Conclusions

The analysis of the new XMM-Newton data confirmed the nonthermal origin for the X-ray
emission with a photon index Γ softening with the distance to the pulsar. We suggest that
the most plausible origin for HESS J1826−130 is due to the IC mechanism within the PWN
powered by PSR J1826−1256.
