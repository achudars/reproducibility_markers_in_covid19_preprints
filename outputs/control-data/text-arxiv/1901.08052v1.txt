THE THICKNESS OF THE KRONECKER PRODUCT OF
GRAPHS
XIA GUO AND YAN YANG
Abstract. The thickness of a graph G is the minimum number of planar
subgraphs whose union is G. In this paper, we present sharp lower and upper
bounds for the thickness of the Kronecker product G × H of two graphs G and
H. We also give the exact thickness numbers for the Kronecker product graphs
Kn × K2 , Km,n × K2 and Kn,n,n × K2 .

1. Introduction
The thickness θ(G) of graph G is the minimum number of planar subgraphs
whose union is G. It is a measurement of the planarity of a graph, the graph
with θ(G) = 1 is a planar graph. Since W.T.Tutte[15] inaugurated the thickness
problem in 1963, the thickness of some classic types of graphs have been obtained
by various authors, such as [1, 3, 4, 12, 16, 18] etc. In recent years, some authors
focus on the thickness of the graphs which are obtained by operating on two
graphs, such as the Cartesian product graph[7, 19] and join graph[8]. In this
paper, we are concerned with the Kronecker product graph.
The Kronecker product (also called as tensor product, direct product, categorical product) G × H of graphs G and H is the graph whose vertex set is
V (G × H) = V (G) × V (H) and edge set is E(G × H) = {(g, h)(g ′, h′ )|gg ′ ∈
E(G) and hh′ ∈ E(H)}. Figure 1 shows the Kronecker product graph K5 × K2 in
which {u1 , . . . , u5} and {v1 , v2 } are the vertex sets of the complete graph K5 and
K2 , respectively. Many authors did research on various topics of the Kronecker
product graph, such as for its planarity[5, 10], connectivity[17], colouring[9, 13]
and application[14] etc.

can be partitioned into two parts X and Y , |X| = m and |Y | = n, every edge has
its ends in different parts and every two vertices in different parts are adjacent.
The complete tripartite graph Kl,m,n is defined analogously.
In this paper, we present lower and upper bounds for the thickness of the
Kronecker product of two graphs in Section 2, in which the lower bound comes
from Euler’s formula and the upper bound is derived from the structure of the
Kronecker product graph. Then we study the thickness of the Kronecker product
of graph with K2 . There are two reasons why we interested in it. One reason is
that the upper bound for the thickness of the Kronecker product of two graphs
we just given rely on that of the Kronecker product of graph with K2 . Another
reason is that the planarity of the Kronecker product of two graphs have been
characterized in [10], but graph with K2 is one of its missing cases. It’s a difficult
case, because there exist non-planar graphs whose Kronecker product with K2
are planar graphs, see Figures 1 and 2 in [5] for example. In Sections 3 and 4, we
provide the exact thickness numbers for the Kronecker product graphs Kn × K2 ,
Km,n × K2 and Kn,n,n × K2 .
For undefined terminology, see [6].
2. Thickness of the Kronecker product graph G × H
Theorem 2.1. Let G and H be two simple graphs on at least two vertices, then

ej ∈E(G)

Proof. It is easy to observe that the number of edges in G × H is |E(G ×
H)| = 2|E(G)||E(H)| and the number of vertices in G × H is |V (G × H)| =
|V (G)||V (H)|. From the Euler’s Formula, the planar graph with |V (G)||V (H)|
vertices, has at most 3|V (G)||V (H)| − 6 edges, the lower bound follows.
From the structure of the Kronecker product graph, we have
G×H =

In the following, we will give examples to show both the lower and upper
bound in Theorem 2.1 are sharp. Let G and H be the graphs as shown in Figure
2(a) and (b) respectively. Figure 2(c) illustrates a planar embedding of the graph
G × {v1 v2 }, in which we denote the vertex (ui , vj ) by uji , 1 ≤ i ≤ 7, 1 ≤ j ≤ 2.
So the thickness of G × {v1 v2 } is one which meets the lower bound in Theorem
2.1. Figure 2(d) illustrates a planar embedding of the graph G × {v2 v3 } which is
isomorphic to G × {v1 v2 }. Because G × H = G × {v1 v2 } ∪ G × {v2 v3 }, we get a
planar subgraph decomposition of G × H with two subgraphs, which shows the
thickness of G × H is not more than two. On the other hand, the graph G × H
contains a subdivision of K5 which are exhibited in Figure 2(e), so G × H is not a

is two which meet the upper bound in Theorem 2.1.

If G × H does not contain any triangle, from the Euler’s Formula, the planar
graph with |V (G)||V (H)| vertices, has at most 2|V (G)||V (H)|−4 edges, a tighter
lower bound can be derived.

3. The thickness of Kn × K2 and Km,n × K2
Let G be a simple graph with n vertices, V (G) = {v1 , . . . , vn } and V (K2 ) =
{1, 2}. Then G × K2 is a bipartite graph, the two vertex parts are {(vi , 1)|1 ≤
i ≤ n} and {(vi , 2)|1 ≤ i ≤ n}, so G × K2 is a subgraph of Kn,n which shows that
θ(G × K2 ) ≤ θ(Kn,n ).
Although the thickness of the complete bipartite Km,n have not been solved
completely, when m = n, we have the following result.
Lemma 3.1. [4] The thickness of the complete bipartite graph Kn,n is

When n = 4p (p ≥ 1), Chen and Yin gave a planar subgraphs decomposition
of K4p,4p with p + 1 planar subgraphs G1 , . . . , Gp+1 in [7]. Denote the two vertex
parts of K4p,4p by U = {u1 , . . . , u4p } and V = {v1 , . . . , v4p }, Figure 3 shows their

Lemma 3.2. [7] Suppose Kn,n is a complete bipartite graph with two vertex parts
U = {u1 , . . . , un } and V = {v1 , . . . , vn }. When n = 4p, there exists a planar
subgraphs decomposition of K4p,4p with p + 1 planar subgraphs G1 , . . . , Gp+1 in
which Gp+1 is a perfect matching of K4p,4p with edge set {ui vi |1 ≤ i ≤ 4p}.
Theorem 3.3. The thickness of the Kronecker product of Kn and K2 is
θ(Kn × K2 ) =

n

Proof. Suppose that the vertex sets of Kn and K2 are {x1 , . . . , xn } and {1, 2}
respectively. The graph Kn × K2 is a bipartite graph whose two vertex parts are
{(xi , 1)|1 ≤ i ≤ n} and {(xi , 2)|1 ≤ i ≤ n}, and edge set is {(xi , 1)(xj , 2)|1 ≤
i, j ≤ n, i 6= j}. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2, we denote the vertex (xi , k) of Kn ×K2
by xki for simplicity.
Since |E(Kn × K2 )| = n(n − 1) and |V (Kn × K2 )| = 2n, from Theorem 2.2,
we have
θ(Kn × K2 ) ≥

In the following, we will construct planar decompositions of Kn × K2 with
subgraphs to complete the proof.

Case 1. When n = 4p.
Suppose that Kn,n is a complete bipartite graph with vertex partition (X 1 , X 2 )
in which X 1 = {x11 , . . . , x1n } and X 2 = {x21 , . . . , x2n }. The graph Gp+1 is a perfect
matching of K4p,4p whose edge set is {x1i x2i |1 ≤ i ≤ n}, then Kn × K2 = Kn,n −
Gp+1 . From Lemma 3.2, there exists a planar decomposition {G1 , . . . , Gp } of
Kn × K2 in which Gr (1 ≤ r ≤ p) is isomorphic to the graph in Figure 3(a).
Therefore, θ(K4p × K2 ) ≤ p.
Case 2. When n = 4p + 2.
When p ≥ 1, we draw a graph G′p+1 as shown in Figure 4, then {G1 , . . . , Gp , G′p+1 }
is a planar decomposition of K4p+2 ×K2 with p+1 subgraphs, so we have θ(K4p+2 ×
K2 ) ≤ p + 1. When n = 2, K2 × K2 = 2K2 is a planar graph.

Case 3. When n = 4p + 1 and n = 4p + 3.
Because K4p+1 × K2 is a subgraph of K4p+2 × K2 , we have θ(K4p+1 × K2 ) ≤
θ(K4p+2 × K2 ) = p + 1. Similarly, when n = 4p + 3, we have θ(K4p+3 × K2 ) ≤
θ(K4(p+1) × K2 ) = p + 1.

4. The thickness of the Kronecker product graph Kn,n,n × K2
Let (X, Y, Z) be the vertex partition of the complete tripartite graph Kl,m,n (l ≤
m ≤ n) in which X = {x1 , . . . , xl }, Y = {y1 , . . . , ym}, Z = {z1 , . . . , zn }. Let
{1, 2} be the vertex set of K2 . We denote the vertex (v, k) of Kl,m,n × K2 by v k in
which v ∈ V (Kn,n,n ) and k ∈ {1, 2}. For k = 1, 2, we denote X k = {xk1 , . . . , xkl },
k
Y k = {y1k , . . . , ym
} and Z k = {z1k , . . . , znk }. In Figure 5, we draw a sketch of the
graph Kl,m,n × K2 , in which the edge joining two vertex set indicates that each
vertex in one vertex set is adjacent to each vertex in another vertex set. Suppose
G(X 1 , Y 2 ) is the graph induced by the vertex sets X 1 and Y 2 of Kl,m,n ×K2 , then
G(X 1 , Y 2 ) is isomorphic to Kl,m , the graphs G(Y 1 , Z 2 ), G(Z 1 , X 2 ), G(X 2 , Y 1 ),
G(Y 2 , Z 1 ) and G(Z 2 , X 1 ) are defined analogously. We define
G1 = G(X 1 , Y 2 ) ∪ G(Y 1 , Z 2 ) ∪ G(Z 1 , X 2 )
and
G2 = G(X 2 , Y 1 ) ∪ G(Y 2 , Z 1 ) ∪ G(Z 2 , X 1 ),
then Kl,m,n × K2 = G1 ∪ G2 .

Theorem 4.1. The thickness of the Kronecker product graph Kl,m,n × K2 (l ≤
m ≤ n) satisfies the inequality
 lm + ln + mn 
≤ θ(Kl,m,n × K2 ) ≤ 2θ(Km,n ).
2(l + m + n) − 2
Proof. From Theorem 3.4, one can get the lower bound in this theorem easily.
Any two graphs of G(X 1 , Y 2 ), G(Y 1 , Z 2 ) and G(Z 1 , X 2 ) are disjoint with each
other and l ≤ m ≤ n, so we have
θ(G1 ) ≤ Max{θ(G(X 1 , Y 2 ), θ(G(Y 1 , Z 2 ), θ(G(Z 1 , X 2 )} = θ(Km,n ).
Similarly, we have
θ(G2 ) ≤ Max{θ(G(X 2 , Y 1 ), θ(G(Y 2 , Z 1 ), θ(G(Z 2 , X 1 ))} = θ(Km,n ).
Due to the graph Kl,m,n × K2 = G1 ∪ G2 , we have θ(Kl,m,n × K2 ) ≤ 2θ(Km,n ).
Summarizing the above, the theorem is obtained.

In the following, we will discuss the thickness of Kn,n,n × K2 and we will see
when n = 4p + 2, the upper and lower bound in Theorem 4.1 are equal, so both
bounds in Theorem 4.1 are sharp.
Lemma 4.2. When n = 4p, there exists a planar decomposition of the Kronecker
product graph Kn,n,n × K2 with 2p + 1 subgraphs.

Proof. Because |X k | = |Y k | = |Z k | = n (k = 1, 2), all the graphs G(X 1 , Y 2 ),
G(Y 1 , Z 2 ), G(Z 1 , X 2 ), G(X 2, Y 1 ), G(Y 2 , Z 1 ), G(Z 2 , X 1 ) are isomorphic to Kn,n .
Let {G1 , . . . , Gp+1} be the planar decomposition of Kn,n as shown in Figure
3. For 1 ≤ r ≤ p + 1, Gr is a bipartite graph, so we also denote it by Gr (V, U).
In Gr (V, U), we replace the vertex set V by X 1 , U by Y 2 , i.e., for each 1 ≤
i ≤ n, replace the vertex vi by x1i , and ui by yi2 , then we get graph Gr (X 1 , Y 2 ).
Analogously, we obtain graphs Gr (Y 1 , Z 2 ),Gr (Z 1 , X 2 ), Gr (X 2 , Y 1 ), Gr (Y 2 , Z 1 )
and Gr (Z 2 , X 1 ).
For 1 ≤ r ≤ p + 1, let
G1r = Gr (X 1 , Y 2 ) ∪ Gr (Y 1 , Z 2 ) ∪ Gr (Z 1 , X 2)
and
G2r = Gr (X 2 , Y 1 ) ∪ Gr (Y 2 , Z 1 ) ∪ Gr (Z 2 , X 1 ).
Because Gr (X 1 , Y 2 ), Gr (Y 1 , Z 2 ), Gr (Z 1 , X 2 ) are all planar graphs and they are
disjoint with each other, G1r is a planar graph. For the same reason, we have that
G2r is also a planar graph.
Let graph Gp+1 be the graph G1p+1 ∪ G2p+1 . We have
Gp+1 = G1p+1 ∪ G2p+1

It is easy to see Gp+1 consists of n disjoint cycles of length 6, hence Gp+1 is a
planar graph.

and
G(Y 2 , Z 1 ) = ∪ Gr (Y 2 , Z 1 ), G(Z 2 , X 1 ) = ∪ Gr (Z 2 , X 1 ),
we have

embedding of G. Then G admits a planar embedding whose outer face has the
same boundary as f .

Proof. Case 1. When p ≤ 1.
When p = 0, the Kronecker product graph K1,1,1 × K2 is a cycle of length 6,
so K1,1,1 × K2 is a planar graph. When p = 1, as shown in Figure 7, we give a
planar decomposition of K5,5,5 × K2 with three subgraphs A, B and C.

Case 2. When p ≥ 2.
Suppose that {G11 , . . . , G1p , G21 , . . . , G2p , Gp+1} is the planar decomposition of
K4p,4p,4p × K2 as provided in the proof of Lemma 4.2. By adding vertices x14p+1 ,

modifications of adding and deleting edges to these graphs, a planar decomposition of K4p+1,4p+1,4p+1 × K2 will be obtained.
For convenience, in Figure 3 we label some faces of Gr (1 ≤ r ≤ p) with face
1, 2 and 3. As indicated in Figure 3, the face 1 is bounded by v4r−1 u4r−3 v4r−2 u4r ,
the face 3 is its outer face, bounded by v4r−3 u4r−2 v4r u4r−1 . The face 2 is bounded
p

{v4i−2 , v4i }.
by u4r−3 v4r−1 u4r−2 vj in which vertex vj can be any vertex of
i=1,i6=r

Because u4r−3 and u4r−2 in Gr (1 ≤ r ≤ p) is joined by 2p − 2 edge-disjoint
paths of length two that we call parallel paths, we can change the order of these
parallel paths without changing the planarity of Gr . Analogously, we can change
the order of parallel paths between u4r−1 and u4r , v4r−3 and v4r−1 , v4r−2 and v4r .

Figure 10. The planar decomposition of K3,3,3 × K2
Case 2. When p ≥ 1.
The graph K4p+3,4p+3 is a thickness (p + 2)-minimal graph. Hobbs, Grossman
[11] and Bouwer, Broere [2] proved it independently, by giving two different planar
subgraphs decompositions {H1 , . . . , Hp+2} of K4p+3,4p+3 in which Hp+2 contains
only one edge. Suppose that the two vertex parts of Kn,n is {v1 , . . . , vn } and
{u1 , . . . , un }, the only one edge in the Hp+2 is va ub (the edge is v1 u1 in [11] and
v4p+3 u4p−1 in [2]). For 1 ≤ i ≤ p + 2, Hi is a bipartite graph, so we also denote it
by Hi (V, U).
Because Kn,n,n × K2 = G1 ∪ G2 in which G1 = G(X 1 , Y 2 ) ∪ G(Y 1 , Z 2 ) ∪
G(Z 1 , X 2) and G2 = G(X 2 , Y 1 ) ∪ G(Y 2 , Z 1 ) ∪ G(Z 2 , X 1 ), |X i | = |Y i | = |Z i | = n
(i = 1, 2), all the graphs G(X 1 , Y 2 ), G(Y 1 , Z 2 ), G(Z 1 , X 2 ), G(X 2 , Y 1 ), G(Y 2 , Z 1 )
and G(Z 2 , X 1 ) are isomorphic to Kn,n .
For graph Hi (V, U) (1 ≤ i ≤ p + 2), We replace the vertex set V by X 1 , U by
2
Y , i.e., for each 1 ≤ t ≤ n, replace the vertex vt by x1t , and ut by yt2 , then we get
a graph Hi (X 1 , Y 2 ). Analogously, we can obtain graphs Hi (Y 1 , Z 2 ), Hi (Z 1 , X 2),
Hi (X 2 , Y 1 ), Hi (Y 2 , Z 1 ) and Hi (Z 2 , X 1). For 1 ≤ i ≤ p + 2, let
Hi1 = Hi (X 1 , Y 2 ) ∪ Hi (Y 1 , Z 2 ) ∪ Hi (Z 1 , X 2 ),
then Hi1 is a planar graph, because Hi (X 1 , Y 2 ), Hi (Y 1 , Z 2 ), Hi (Z 1 , X 2 ) are disjoint with each other. For the same reason, the graph
Hi2 = Hi (X 2 , Y 1 ) ∪ Hi (Y 2 , Z 1 ) ∪ Hi (Z 2 , X 1 )
is also a planar graph, 1 ≤ i ≤ p + 2. And we have

in which

and E(Hp+2
) = {x2a yb1 , ya2zb1 , za2 x1b }.
1
In the following, we will add edges in E(Hp+2
) to graphs H12 and H22 , add
2
edges in E(Hp+2
) to graphs H11 and H12 to complete the proof. From Lemma
4.3, there exists a planar embedding of H1 (Y 1 , Z 2 ) such that vertex za2 on the
boundary of its outer face, exists a planar embedding of H1 (X 1 , Y 2 ) such that x1b
on the boundary of its outer face. Then we join za2 to x1b without edge crossing.
Suppose yb1 is on the boundary of inner face F of the embedding of H1 (Y 1 , Z 2 ),
put the embedding of H1 (Z 1 , X 2 ) in face F with x2a on the boundary of its outer
face, then we join x2a to yb1 without edge crossing. After adding both x2a yb1 and
e 1 . With the same
za2 x1b to H11 without edge crossing, we get a planar graph H

process, we add both x1a yb2 and za1 zb2 to H12 without edge crossing, then we get a

When n = 4p+2, because K4p+2,4p+2,4p+2 ×K2 is a subgraph of K4p+3,4p+3,4p+3 ×
K2 , we have θ(K4p+2,4p+2,4p+2 × K2 ) ≤ θ(K4p+3,4p+3,4p+3 × K2 ). Combining this
fact with Lemmas 4.2 ,4.4 and 4.5, we have
