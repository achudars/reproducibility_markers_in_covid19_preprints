We use lattice QCD to investigate the spectrum of the b̄b̄ud four-quark system with quantum
numbers I(J P ) = 0(1+ ). We use five different gauge-link ensembles with 2 + 1 flavors of domainwall fermions, including one at the physical pion mass, and treat the heavy b̄ quark within the
framework of lattice nonrelativistic QCD. Our work improves upon previous similar computations
by considering in addition to local four-quark interpolators also nonlocal two-meson interpolators
and by performing a Lüscher analysis to extrapolate our results to infinite volume. We obtain
a binding energy of (−128 ± 24 ± 10) MeV, corresponding to the mass (10476 ± 24 ± 10) MeV,
which confirms the existence of a b̄b̄ud tetraquark that is stable with respect to the strong and
electromagnetic interactions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Mesons, i.e., hadrons with integer spin, were first envisioned by Gell-Mann and Zweig [1, 2] to be built from one,
two or more quark-antiquark pairs. However, systems that manifestly contain more than a single quark-antiquark
pair were found only relatively recently, primarily in the heavy-quark sector [3–8]. Exotic mesons can be characterized
as having J P C quantum numbers that cannot be constructed in the simple quark-antiquark model, or as having a
manifestly exotic quark flavor content. In this work, we consider an example for the latter, a b̄b̄ud tetraquark.1
It can be shown that QCD-stable Q̄Q̄qq tetraquarks must exist in the limit mQ → ∞ [9–11]. In this limit, the two
heavy antiquarks form a color-triplet object with a size of order (αs mQ )−1 and a binding energy of order αs2 mQ due
to the attractive Coulomb potential at short distances. The doubly-heavy Q̄Q̄qq tetraquarks then become related to
singly-heavy Qqq baryons, just like doubly-heavy Q̄Q̄q̄ baryons become related to singly-heavy Qq̄ mesons [12–15].
The question is whether the physical bottom quark is heavy enough for b̄b̄qq bound states to exist below the b̄q-b̄q
two-meson thresholds. Studies based on potential models, effective field theories, and QCD sum rules suggest that this
is indeed the case [9–11, 16–30]. Possible experimental search strategies for bottomness-2 tetraquarks are discussed
in Refs. [31–33].
Within lattice QCD, b̄b̄qq four-quark systems were explored for the first time using static b̄ quarks and the BornOppenheimer approximation. A stable b̄b̄ud tetraquark with quantum numbers I(J P ) = 0(1+ ) around 30 . . . 90 MeV
below the BB ∗ threshold as well as a b̄b̄ud tetraquark resonance with quantum numbers I(J P ) = 0(1− ) around 15 MeV
above the BB threshold were predicted [34–38]. Effects from the heavy-quark spin were investigated for the stable
I(J P ) = 0(1+ ) tetraquark by solving a coupled-channel Schrödinger equation in Ref. [37]. Moreover, several flavor
combinations were explored and no stable b̄b̄qq tetraquarks with qq = ss and qq = cc were found in this approach
[39]. Recently, the same b̄b̄qq four-quark systems have been investigated with b̄ quarks of finite mass treated within
nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD). A stable b̄b̄ud tetraquark with quantum numbers I(J P ) = 0(1+ ) was also seen in two
such computations [40, 41], but there is a quantitative difference by a factor ≈ 2 . . . 3 in the binding energy between
Refs. [40, 41] and Ref. [37], which is not yet understood. Moreover, Q̄Q̄qq systems with further flavor combinations
Q̄Q̄ ∈ {b̄b̄, b̄c̄, c̄c̄} and q ∈ {u, d, s, c} have been investigated and some indication has been obtained that systems with
J P = 1+ and Q̄Q̄qq ∈ {b̄b̄us, b̄b̄uc, b̄b̄sc , b̄c̄ud , c̄c̄ud} are stable as well [41, 42].
In this paper we perform a lattice QCD study of the b̄b̄ud four-quark system with quantum numbers I(J P ) = 0(1+ ),
using NRQCD b̄ quarks and domain-wall light quarks (results obtained at an early stage of this project have been
presented in Ref. [43]). We make use of both local interpolating fields (in which the four quarks are jointly projected
to zero momentum) and nonlocal interpolating fields (in which each of the two quark-antiquark pairs forming a
color-singlet is projected to zero momentum individually). It has been shown in previous studies of other systems
1

In the literature, the term “tetraquark” is somewhat ambiguous. In certain papers it exclusively refers to a diquark-antidiquark structure,
while in other papers it is used more generally for arbitrary bound states and resonances with a strong four-quark component, including,
e.g., mesonic molecules. Throughout this paper we follow the latter convention. Moreover, the b̄b̄ud system is a tetraquark in a fully
rigorous sense, since it contains four net quark flavors.

2
[44, 45] that including both types of interpolating fields is required to reliably determine ground-state energies in
exotic channels. In this way we expand on the works of Refs. [40–42], where nonlocal interpolating fields were not
considered. Having both local and nonlocal interpolating fields allows us to determine the ground-state and firstexcited-state energy in the I(J P ) = 0(1+ ) channel and perform a Lüscher analysis of BB ∗ scattering.
The paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II we summarize our lattice setup, including the computation of quark
propagators. In Sec. III we discuss the interpolating operators and the corresponding correlation functions. The
extraction of the energy levels on the lattice is discussed in Secs. IV and V. In Sec. VI we present the scattering
analysis, and in Sec. VII we perform a fit of the pion-mass dependence of the binding energy and estimate systematic
uncertainties. Our conclusions are given in Sec. VIII.

LATTICE SETUP

Gauge-link configurations and light-quark propagators

We performed the computations presented here using gauge-link configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD
collaborations [46, 47] with 2+1 flavors of domain-wall fermions [48–51] and the Iwasaki gauge action [52]. We use
the five ensembles listed in Table I, which differ in the lattice spacing a ≈ 0.083 fm . . . 0.114 fm, the lattice size (spatial
extent ≈ 2.65 fm . . . 5.48 fm) and the pion mass mπ ≈ 139 MeV . . . 431 MeV. Ensemble C00078 uses the Möbius
domain-wall action [51] with length of the fifth dimension N5 = 24, while the other ensembles use the Shamir action
[50] with N5 = 16. The lattice spacings listed in the Table were determined in Ref. [47].

column titled “Nmeas ” gives the total numbers of sloppy and exact light-quark propagators used on each ensemble. The values
NEV and NCG, sl are the numbers of eigenvectors used for the deflation of the light-quark solver, and the conjugate-gradient
counts used for the sloppy propagators.

Our calculation uses smeared point-to-all propagators for the up and down quarks (the smearing parameters are
given in Sec. III A). The computational cost of generating these propagators was reduced using the all-mode-averaging
technique [53, 54]. On each configuration, a small number of samples of “exact” correlation functions is combined
with a large number of samples of “sloppy” correlation functions in such a way that the expectation value is equal
to the exact expectation value, but the variance is reduced significantly due to the large number of sloppy samples
[53, 54]. The exact correlation functions are generated from light-quark propagators computed with high precision
(relative solver residual of 10−8 ), while the sloppy correlation functions are generated from approximate light-quark
propagators. We used the conjugate gradient (CG) solver combined with low-mode deflation, where in the case
of the approximate propagators the CG iteration count is fixed to a smaller value, NCG, sl , than needed for the
exact propagators. The lowest NEV eigenvectors of the domain-wall operator were computed using Lanczos with
Chebyshev-polynomial acceleration. The values of NEV and NCG,sl are also listed in the table. On a given gauge-link
configuration, the different samples were obtained by displacing the source locations on a four-dimensional grid, with
a randomly chosen overall offset.

B.

Bottom-quark propagators

The heavy b quarks are treated with the framework of lattice nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) [55, 56]. We use
the same lattice NRQCD action and parameters as in Ref. [57]. This action includes all quark-bilinear operators
through order v 4 in the heavy-heavy power counting, and order Λ2 /m2b in the heavy-light power counting. The bare
heavy-quark mass was tuned on the C005 and F004 ensembles such that the spin-averaged bottomonium kinematic

3
mass agrees with experiment, using the lattice spacing determinations of Ref. [58]. We use the same masses also on
the other coarse and fine ensembles, respectively, as shown in Table II. The matching coefficients c1 , c2 , c3 were set
to their tree-level values (= 1), while for c4 we use a result computed at one loop in lattice perturbation theory [59].
The gauge links entering the NRQCD action are divided by the mean link u0L in Landau gauge to achieve tadpole
improvement [60, 61].

Since we focus on the computation of the energy spectrum in this work, it is sufficient to use the leading-order,

INTERPOLATING OPERATORS AND CORRELATION FUNCTIONS
b̄b̄ud four-quark system

A.

We are interested in the spectrum of the doubly-bottomed system with quantum numbers I(J P ) = 0(1+ ). The
lowest two thresholds in this channel correspond to the meson pairs BB ∗ and B ∗ B ∗ . The lowest three-meson threshold
is BBπ, which is approximately 44 MeV above B ∗ B ∗ . From Ref. [57] we can see that the Ξbb N antibaryon-baryon
threshold is already much higher than the B ∗ B ∗ threshold: 11.1 GeV for Ξbb N compared to 10.6 GeV for B ∗ B ∗ .
The J P = 1+ quantum numbers appear in the T1g irreducible representation (irrep) of the Oh point group [62].
To determine the low-lying spectrum in this irrep we make use of two types of interpolating operators: local and
nonlocal. The first three operators are local operators, in which all four (smeared) quark fields are multiplied at the
same space-time point and the product is projected to zero momentum (in the following we omit the time coordinate):

4
Above, a, b, c, . . . denote color indices, j, k, l spatial vector indices, and C = γ0 γ2 is the charge-conjugation matrix.
We expect that operators O1 to O3 generate sizable overlap to a tetraquark state. O1 is an obvious choice in
studying this channel. Our reason to include O2 is a bit more subtle. Since two B ∗ mesons are around 45 MeV
heavier than a B and a B ∗ meson, one might expect that O[B ∗ B ∗ ](0) will have less overlap with the ground state than
O[BB ∗ ](0) . However, a previous investigation with static quarks (see Ref. [37] and Fig. 3 therein) has determined the
wave functions for both BB ∗ and B ∗ B ∗ contributions and found that both spin structures are of similar importance.
The inclusion of the color-triplet diquark-antidiquark interpolator O3 is motivated by the heavy-quark limit, in which
the two heavy antiquarks are expected to form a compact color-triplet object, and the tetraquark becomes equivalent
to a singly heavy baryon [9–11]. The importance of diquark operators was also discussed in Refs. [63, 64].
Note that in exotic channels it is typically difficult to properly resolve the ground state due to the coupling
to nearby thresholds. An example of this phenomenon is the positive-parity Ds spectrum, where the authors of
Refs. [44, 45] had to include nonlocal interpolating operators to resolve the Ds0 (2317) mass puzzle. Previous studies
of the I(J P ) = 0(1+ ), bottomness-2 sector [40, 41] did not include multi-hadron operators, which might have affected
their results. To make our determination of the spectrum more robust, we include operators O4 and O5 , which are
nonlocal meson-meson scattering operators built from two color-singlets separately projected to zero momentum. We
expect them to generate sizable overlap with the nearby first excited state, which will help us isolate the ground state
in the multi-exponential fits of the correlation matrices.
To improve the overlap to the low-lying states, we employ standard smearing techniques. The quark fields in O1 to
O5 are Gaussian-smeared using

where ∆ is the nearest-neighbor gauge-covariant spatial Laplacian. For the up and down quarks, the gauge links in

parameters are collected in Table III.

such sweeps.

where h. . .i denotes the path integral expectation value. The corresponding nonperturbative quark-field Wick contractions in a given gauge-field configuration are shown in Fig. 1. Because the calculation of the light-quark propagators is
computationally expensive, we reuse existing smeared point-to-all propagators. With such propagators we are limited
to operators O1 , O2 , O3 at the source, which have only a single momentum projection, allowing us to remove the
summation over x at the source (using translational symmetry). Thus, we do not determine the elements C44 (t),
C45 (t), C54 (t) and C55 (t) of the correlation matrix, where two momentum projections are needed both at the source
and at the sink. For a detailed discussion of this approach, see, for example, Refs. [67, 68].
The correlation matrix has analytical properties that follow from the symmetries of lattice QCD, in particular
time reversal and charge conjugation. These symmetries imply that (Cjk (t))∗ = Ckj (t) and that all Cjk (t) are real.
Moreover, one can relate Cjk (+t) and Cjk (−t). We exploit these analytical findings to improve our lattice QCD
results, by averaging related correlation functions appropriately and by setting all imaginary parts (which are pure
noise) to zero.

B and B ∗ meson

Since we will compare the energy levels of the b̄b̄ud four-quark system to the BB ∗ threshold, we need to determine
the energies of the B and B ∗ mesons within the same setup. We use the interpolating operators

(needed for the scattering analysis in Sec. VI). The quark fields are smeared with the same parameters as in Table

(p, 0)i and hOB ∗ (p, t)OB
∗ (p, 0)i. As discussed in Sec. III A,
we perform the summation over x at the sink only.

IV.

ENERGIES AND KINETIC MASSES OF THE B AND B ∗ MESONS

We determined the energies of the B and B ∗ mesons from single-exponential fits of the two-point functions; the
results are listed in Table IV. An example of a corresponding effective-energy plot is shown in Fig. 2. The energy of a
state containing nb bottom quarks is shifted by nb times the NRQCD energy shift, which at tree-level would be equal
to −mb . This energy shift is not known with high precision, but cancels in energy differences with matching numbers
of bottom quarks, including the quantities of interest in the following sections: En − EB − EB ∗ , where En is the n-th
energy level of the b̄b̄ud system.
For the scattering analysis in Sec. VI (and to assess the tuning of the b-quark mass), we also need the momentumdependence of the B and B ∗ energies. We find that within statistical uncertainties our results are consistent with the
form
q
EB (p) = EB (0) + m2B, kin + p2 − mB, kin

On the C00078 and C005 ensembles, the spin-averaged kinetic masses mkin,spinav = 14 mB, kin + 34 mB ∗, kin agree with
the experimental value of 5.28272(2) GeV [69]. On the other ensembles, the lattice results are up to 5% higher, which
can be attributed mainly to the following:
(i) The tuning of the bare b-quark mass was performed using bottomonium; the results here are affected by the
heavier-than-physical light-quark masses and by discretization errors.
(ii) The tuning was performed using a different determination of the lattice spacing (that of Ref. [58], while here we
use the lattice spacing determinations of Ref. [47] to convert to physical units).
However, the effect of a possible <
∼ 5% mistuning of the b-quark mass is expected to be even smaller in the energy
differences En − EB − EB ∗ due to partial suppression by heavy-quark symmetry. The hyperfine splittings EB ∗ − EB
are of order Λ/mb , and are therefore affected by the same relative error as the b-quark mass, which corresponds to an
absolute error of <
∼ 2.5 MeV. Our results for the hyperfine splittings are also shown in Table IV. The value from the
physical-pion-mass ensemble C00078 is consistent with the experimental value of 45.3(2) MeV [69]. We find a trend
of increasing hyperfine splitting as the light-quark mass is increased.

which is a good approximation in our case. As discussed in Sec. III A, all Cjk (t) are real and, thus, so are the overlap
factors
Zjn = hΩ|Oj |ni.

(17)

To extract the energies En from our numerical results for Cjk (t), we perform fully correlated, least-χ2 , multiexponential fits using a truncated version of (16),
Cjk (t) ≈

N
−1
X

Zjn Zkn e−En t ,

(18)

n=0

where we must choose the time range tmin ≤ t ≤ tmax such that contributions from higher excited states are negligible.
To enforce the ordering of the En returned from the fit, for n > 0 we actually use the logarithms of the energy
differences, ln = ln(aEn − aEn−1 ), as our fit parameters. Furthermore, we rewrote the overlap factors for n > 0 as
Zn = Bn Z0 and used Bn as the fit parameters. Note that Cjk (t) does not need to be a square matrix. In particular,
the multi-exponential matrix fit method allows us to also include correlation matrix elements Cjk (t) with j = 4, 5
and k = 1, 2, 3, i.e. the scattering operators O4 and O5 . An example of such a (5 × 3) matrix fit is shown in Fig. 3.
On each ensemble, we performed fits to the full matrix as well as to various sub-matrices, for different fit ranges and
different numbers of states. The results are listed in Tables VIII-XII in Appendix A.
The matrix fits have a large number of degrees of freedom, and the covariance matrix, whose inverse enters in χ2 ,
can become poorly determined or singular if the number of statistical samples used to estimate this matrix is not
much larger than the number of degrees of freedom. This is particularly problematic when using all-mode-averaging
(or, more generally, covariant-approximation-averaging, CAA), where the samples are given by [53, 54]

displacements s to the initial source location e, with s = 0 corresponding to no displacement. As shown in Table I,
the number of exact samples, and hence CAA samples, is as low as 80 in the case of the C00078 ensemble. To obtain
a meaningful χ2 even for large numbers of degrees of freedom, we use a “modified CAA” (MCAA) procedure, given
by

(MCAA sample)e,s = (exact sample)e − (sloppy sample)e,0 + (sloppy sample)e,s .

(20)

This procedure provides Nsloppy (= 32 in our case) times as many samples as the standard CAA procedure, without changing the overall average, and allows robust matrix fits even in the (5 × 3) case. The drawback is that
there are autocorrelations between the different choices of s, introduced by the constant (but very small) term
(exact sample)e − (sloppy sample)e,0 and by any possible autocorrelations between the different sloppy samples on
the same configuration. As a result of these autocorrelations, the uncertainties of parameters obtained from fits based
on the MCAA procedure are initially slightly underestimated. We correct for these autocorrelations by rescaling all
uncertainties in the fitted En with a factor estimated for each ensemble using the simple B meson two-point functions.
The factor is given by the ratio of uncertainties of the B meson energies obtained from single-exponential fits using
the CAA and MCAA procedures. The factors range from 1.08 to 1.27. The uncertainties of all results shown in this
paper are already corrected with these factors.
The condition numbers of the data covariance matrices range from approximately 106 to 1015 , depending on how
many interpolating operators are included and on the fit range. We always computed the full inverse using LU
decomposition. The minimization of χ2 was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, with initial guesses
for the fit parameters obtained as described in Sec. V B of Ref. [70]. The fit results were stable under variations of
the initial guesses within reasonable ranges.
As a cross-check of the multi-exponential matrix fitting method, we also determined the spectrum using the variational approach, which involves solving the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) [71–73]. We found that the GEVP
method, where applicable, gives results consistent with the direct multi-exponential matrix fits. The comparison of
the two methods is presented in Appendix B.

Even though the actual energy levels for a chosen set of quantum numbers are independent of the interpolating
operators used in the two-point functions, in practice the numerical results depend on these choices, due to limited
statistical precision. In Fig. 4 we present the two lowest energy levels relative to the BB ∗ threshold as determined
on ensemble C005 using multi-exponential matrix fitting. The interpolators used are indicated by the five bars below
each column. The three black bars at the bottom correspond to the local interpolators O1 , O2 , O3 , while the two
red bars at the top correspond to the nonlocal interpolators O4 and O5 . A filled bar indicates that an interpolator is
included, an empty bar that it is not included. Two things are evident from Fig. 4: first, stable results for the two
lowest energy levels are only obtained once the nonlocal two-meson interpolators are included in the analysis; second,
once the nonlocal interpolators are included, the estimates of both the ground-state energy and the first excited energy
drop significantly. Both observations clearly indicate the importance of the nonlocal interpolators for our study of
the b̄b̄ud system. Note that the first excited energy is close to the BB ∗ threshold, while the ground state energy
is significantly below threshold. This is a first indication that the ground state corresponds to a stable tetraquark,
while the first excitation corresponds to a meson-meson scattering state. Similar plots for the other four ensembles
are collected in Appendix A.

Overlap factors

For a given j, the overlap factors Zjn indicate the relative importance of the energy eigenstates |ni when expanding
the trial state Oj† |Ωi in terms of energy eigenstates,
Oj† |Ωi =

n=0

|nihn|Oj† |Ωi =

Zjn |ni.

(21)

Therefore, the overlap factors Zjn provide certain information about the composition and quark arrangement of the
energy eigenstates |ni. In particular, if the overlap factor Zjm for one state |mi is significantly larger than all other
Zjn , n 6= m, this might be a sign that |mi is quite similar to Oj† |Ωi.
It is convenient to consider rescaled squared overlap factors,
|Z̃jn |2 =

|Zjn |2
,
maxm (|Zjm |2 )

(22)

which are normalized such that maxm (|Z̃jm |2 ) = 1 for each trial state Oj† |Ωi. Here, the indices n and m can take on
values from 0 to N − 1, where N is the number of states included in the fit. The results for |Z̃jn |2 obtained from our
fits are qualitatively similar for all ensembles, and do not strongly depend on the temporal fit range tmin ≤ t ≤ tmax .
In Fig. 5 we show the normalized overlap factors obtained on ensemble C005 using the full 5 × 3 correlation matrix
for N = 2 and N = 3, with fit ranges of 14 ≤ t/a ≤ 24 and 12 ≤ t/a ≤ 24, respectively. One can see that for the
trial state created by the diquark-antidiquark operator O3 , the ground-state overlap is significantly larger than the
overlap to the first excited state. Vice versa, for the two trial states created by the nonlocal meson-meson operators
O4 and O5 , the overlaps to the first excited state are larger than the ground-state overlaps. This supports our above
interpretation concerning the composition of the lowest two energy eigenstates: the ground state |0i seems to be a

the lower row corresponds to a three-exponential fit with 12 ≤ t/a ≤ 24. The mean values and variances of the |Z̃jn |2 were

four-quark bound state and the first excitation |1i a meson-meson scattering state. Finally, it is interesting to note
that in the three-exponential fit, the local meson-meson operators O1 and O2 appear to produce a large overlap with
the second excited state, while the diquark-antidiquark operator O3 and the nonlocal operators O4 and O5 do not
(also note that the large values of |Z12 |2 /|Z10 |2 = 4 ± 5, |Z22 |2 /|Z20 |2 = 8 ± 9 substantially change the normalization of
the plots for O1 and O2 when going from N = 2 to N = 3). What appears in the fit as the “second excited state”
(with a rather high energy and large uncertainty, as shown in Table IX) is likely an admixture of the dense spectrum
of all the scattering states above threshold, which are all created with similar weights by the local operators O1 and
O2 , while the nonlocal operators O4 and O5 mostly create the lowest-lying scattering state.

D.

Final results for the lowest two energy levels on each ensemble

To obtain final results for the energy differences ∆E0 and ∆E1 on each ensemble, we select a subset of fits that
we deem reliable, based on the discussion in the previous two subsections and based on χ2 /d.o.f.. All of these fits,
which are indicated with filled symbols in Fig. 4 and Figs. 9-12, include at least one of the nonlocal interpolating
operators O4 and O5 . We then repeat all selected fits for 500 bootstrap samples, where each bootstrap sample
consists of randomly drawn gauge-link configurations and source locations (using the same random numbers for the
different types of fits to preserve correlations). This produces 500 samples for ∆E0 and ∆E1 for each type of fit
(and on each ensemble). We then average these values over the different types of fits with equal weights, bootstrap
sample by bootstrap sample. Finally, we compute the mean and standard deviation (rescaled again by the MCAA
autocorrelation correction factors; see the discussion in Sec. V A) of these new 500 samples. The results for ∆E0 and
∆E1 obtained in this way are listed in Table VI and are indicated with the horizontal lines and shaded uncertainty
bands in Fig. 4 and Figs. 9-12.

SCATTERING ANALYSIS

The energies En determined in a spectroscopy computation can be related to the infinite-volume scattering amplitude using Lüscher’s method [74] and its generalizations [75–82]; see Ref. [83] for a recent review. Here, we apply
Lüscher’s method to the lowest two energy levels of the b̄b̄ud system in the T1g irrep, assuming that these energy
levels can be described in terms of the elastic S-wave B-B ∗ scattering amplitude (and its analytic continuation below
threshold). We neglect higher partial waves and the coupling to other channels, such as B ∗ B ∗ . Thus, we obtain the
S-wave B-B ∗ scattering amplitude for the two scattering momenta k0 and k1 that correspond to E0 and E1 . Having
only these two points limits the choice of parametrization of the scattering amplitude to a function with two parameters, for which we use the effective-range expansion (ERE). The ERE parametrization then allows us to determine
the infinite-volume bound-state energy.

A.

Relation between finite-volume energy levels and infinite-volume phase shifts

We define the scattering momentum kn corresponding to the n-th energy level of the b̄b̄ud system En through the
equation
En = EB +

q

m2B, kin + kn2 − mB, kin + EB ∗ +

q
m2B ∗, kin + kn2 − mB ∗, kin ,

(23)

12
where EB = EB (0) and EB ∗ = EB ∗ (0) are the energies of the single-B meson and single-B ∗ meson states at zero
momentum. Solving for kn2 gives
kn2 =

∆En (∆En + 2mB, kin )(∆En + 2mB ∗, kin )(∆En + 2mB, kin + 2mB ∗, kin )
,
4(∆En + mB, kin + mB ∗, kin )2

(24)

where
∆En = En − EB − EB ∗ .

(25)

The mapping between the finite-volume scattering momentum in the rest frame and the infinite-volume scattering
amplitude expressed as the S-wave scattering phase shift δ0 is
cot δ0 (kn ) =

2Z00 (1; (kn L/2π)2 )

(26)

where Z00 is the generalized zeta function [74]. The scattering amplitude is given by

(27)

Effective-range expansion and determination of the bound-state pole

On each ensemble, we use the lattice QCD results for the energy differences ∆E0 and ∆E1 combined with the
corresponding results for the B and B ∗ meson energies and kinetic masses to calculate kn2 for n = 0 and n = 1 using
Eq. (24), and we determine the corresponding kn cot δ0 (kn ) using Eq. (26). We parametrize the scattering amplitude
using the effective-range expansion (ERE),
k cot δ0 (k) =

1
1
+ r0 k 2 + O(k 4 ),
a0
2

(28)

and determine the two parameters a0 (the S-wave scattering length) and r0 (the S-wave effective range). Bound
states correspond to poles in the scattering amplitude (27) below threshold, where −ik > 0. Such a pole occurs for
cot δ0 (kBS ) = i, where kBS is the (imaginary) bound-state momentum. Combining this condition with the ERE then
gives
−|kBS | =

where terms of O(|kBS |4 ) are neglected. We solve Eq. (29) for |kBS | and obtain the binding energy via

(30)

This approach was previously utilized in Refs. [44, 45, 84, 85]. Determining masses of bound states in this way
is equivalent to taking the infinite-volume limit up to exponentially small finite-volume corrections proportional to
e−|kBS |L (for more details, see, for example, Refs. [86, 87]).
C.

Numerical results

In Fig. 6 we show k cot δ0 (k) = 1/a0 + r0 k 2 /2 as a function of the scattering momentum k together with the
corresponding lattice data points, for the five different ensembles. One can see that k cot δ0 (k) is consistent with zero
within uncertainties at k = 0, which implies an inverse scattering length also consistent with zero. The results for the
inverse scattering length 1/a0 , the effective range r0 , the binding momentum |kBS |, and the binding energy Ebinding
are given in Table VII. The binding energies are essentially identical to the finite-volume energy differences ∆E0
collected in Table VI. This supports our interpretation of the ground state as a stable tetraquark. We also applied the
consistency check proposed in Ref. [88], but our statistical uncertainties are too large to reach a definitive conclusion.
As indicated in Fig. 6, the first excited state is close to the inelastic B ∗ B ∗ threshold for some of the data sets,
which means that the single-channel analysis performed here is not well justified. A coupled-channel analysis is not
feasible with the data we have, but is unlikely to significantly affect the results for the bound state.

FIT OF THE PION-MASS DEPENDENCE AND ESTIMATES OF SYSTEMATIC
UNCERTAINTIES

Given the statistical uncertainties in our results for Ebinding (shown in Table VII), we cannot resolve any significant
dependence on the lattice spacing or pion mass. We expect lattice discretization errors to be at the level of a few
MeV, as discussed further below. Since this is well below our statistical uncertainties, we choose to perform a fit of
the pion-mass dependence of our results from all ensembles without including a-dependence. We consider a quadratic
pion-mass dependence, corresponding to linear dependence on the light-quark mass,
Ebinding (mπ ) = Ebinding (mπ,phys ) + c(m2π − m2π,phys ),

(31)

where we use mπ,phys = 135 MeV for the physical pion mass in the isospin-symmetric limit. The fit gives

2

Ebinding (mπ,phys ) = (−128 ± 24) MeV,

c = (1.5 ± 2.3) × 10−4 MeV−2 ,

(32)

and has χ /d.o.f. = 0.27. A plot of the fit function together with the data is shown in Fig. 7. Given that, (i), the fit
has excellent quality, (ii), the resulting coefficient c is consistent with zero, and (iii), the result for Ebinding (mπ,phys )
is nearly identical with the result from the C00078 ensemble with mπ = 139(1) MeV, we conclude that any remaining
systematic uncertainties associated with the extrapolation to mπ,phys are negligible.

FIG. 7. Fit of the pion-mass dependence of Ebinding . The vertical dashed line indicates the physical pion mass.

The lattice discretization errors associated with our light-quark and gluon actions and are expected to be at the 1%
level for the fine lattices, and at the 2% level for the coarse lattices [47]; multiplying by the QCD scale of Λ ∼ 300 MeV
yields 3 MeV to 6 MeV. The NRQCD action introduces additional systematic uncertainties. For our choice of lattice
discretization and matching coefficients, the most significant systematic errors in the energy of a heavy-light hadron
are expected to be the following:
• Four-quark operators, which arise at order αs2 in the matching to full QCD, are not included in the action. The
analysis of Ref. [89] suggests that their effects could be as large as 3 MeV.
g
• The matching coefficient c4 of the operator − 2m
σ · B was computed to one loop. Missing higher-order
b
corrections to this coefficient introduce systematic errors of order

αs2 Λ2 /mb ≈ 2 MeV.

(33)

• The matching coefficients of the operators of order (Λ/mb )2 were computed at tree-level only. The missing
radiative corrections to these coefficients introduce systematic errors of order
αs Λ3 /m2b ≈ 0.4 MeV.

(34)

These estimates are appropriate for EB and EB ∗ , which contribute to our calculation of the binding energy via
Ebinding = EBS − EB − EB ∗ . For the tetraquark energy EBS , the power counting is more complicated due to the
presence of two bottom quarks. Conservative estimates of the systematic errors can be obtained by replacing the scale
Λ in the heavy-light power counting by the binding momentum |kBS | ∼ 800 MeV, which suggests systematic errors of
order 10 MeV. It is likely that there is a partial cancellation of the systematic errors in Ebinding = EBS − EB − EB ∗ .
Therefore, we estimate the overall discretization and heavy-quark systematic errors to be not larger than 10 MeV (in
future work, the estimates of the heavy-quark errors could be made more precise by numerically investigating the
dependence of Ebinding on the lattice NRQCD matching coefficients). Our final results for the tetraquark binding
energy and mass are therefore
Ebinding (mπ,phys ) = (−128 ± 24 ± 10) MeV,

mtetraquark (mπ,phys ) = (10476 ± 24 ± 10) MeV,

(35)

where mtetraquark is obtained by adding the experimental values of the B and B ∗ masses [69] to Ebinding .

CONCLUSIONS

In this work we computed the low-lying spectrum in the bottomness-2 and I(J P ) = 0(1+ ) sector. Using both local
and nonlocal interpolating operators, we determined the two lowest energy levels for five different ensembles of lattice
gauge-link configurations, including one with approximately physical light-quark masses. We carried out a Lüscher
analysis for the first time in this sector and used the effective-range expansion to find the infinite-volume binding

energies (but we found these to be nearly identical to the finite-volume binding energies). Our calculation confirms
the existence of a b̄b̄ud bound state that is stable under the strong and electromagnetic interactions.
In Fig. 8 we compare our result (35) for the binding energy with several previous determinations. These include
direct lattice QCD calculations that also treated the heavy b̄ quarks with NRQCD [40, 41], calculations in the BornOppenheimer approximation using static b̄b̄ potentials (in the presence of u and d valence quarks) computed on the
lattice [34, 35, 37], as well as the studies of Refs. [9, 11, 16–26, 28–30], which are based on quark models, effective
field theories, or QCD sum rules.
The calculations using static b̄b̄ potentials from lattice QCD [34, 35, 37] consistently give a binding energy that is
about a factor of 2 smaller than our result (35), but this disagreement might be due the approximations used there,
in particular the neglect of 1/mb corrections to the potentials.
The two previous direct lattice QCD calculations [40, 41] employed only local four-quark interpolating operators.
According to our observations, the lack of nonlocal operators can affect the reliability of the extracted ground-state
energy, as the local operators are not well suited to isolate the lowest BB ∗ threshold state. While the result of Ref. [41]
agrees with ours, Ref. [40] gives a significantly larger binding energy. Apart from the lack of nonlocal interpolating
operators, another possible source of this discrepancy might be the use of ratios of correlation functions as input
to the generalized eigenvalue problem in Ref. [40]. It is interesting to observe that the effective energies shown in
Refs. [40, 41] approach the ground state from below, corresponding to a decrease in the magnitude of the extracted
binding energy as the time separation is increased. Both of these studies used wall sources for the quark fields, while
we use Gaussian-smeared sources. These two types of sources can behave quite differently with regard to excited-state
contamination [90]. Furthermore, the excited-state spectrum of B-B ∗ and B ∗ -B ∗ scattering states above threshold
is very dense, because the changes in the kinetic energy when increasing the back-to-back momenta are suppressed
by the heavy-meson masses. For example, on a lattice with L = 6 fm, the energy difference between the threshold
and next scattering state is only around 8 MeV. In the context of two-nucleon systems, it has been argued that the
dense spectrum can lead to “fake plateaus” at short time separations in the effective energies from ratios of correlation
functions [91]; see Ref. [92] for a critical discussion of this issue.

16
Even though our work has improved upon previous studies of the b̄b̄ud system by including nonlocal mesonmeson scattering operators at the sink, our fits still require rather large time separations, leading to large statistical
uncertainties. As demonstrated for the case of the H dibaryon in Ref. [68], the results can be vastly improved by
including nonlocal operators at both source and sink, and by including additional back-to-back momenta to map out
a larger region of the spectrum. This requires more advanced techniques [67, 93] for constructing the correlation
functions.

In Figs. 9-12 we show the two lowest energy levels for the ensembles C00078, C01, F004, and F006. The style is
identical to Fig. 4, where the same energy levels are shown for ensemble C005, and which is discussed in detail in
Sec. V C. The numerical results of the fits for all ensembles are given in Tables VIII-XII.

Appendix B: Comparison of multi-exponential matrix fitting and solving the GEVP

In this section we compare the multi-exponential matrix fitting method, used in the main part of this work, to the
variational method [71–73]. The latter is based on the generalized eigenvalue problem
Cjk (t)vkn (t, t0 ) = λn (t, t0 )Cjk (t0 )vkn (t, t0 ),

(B1)

where Cjk (t) must be a hermitian square matrix. As discussed in Sec. III A, our use of point-to-all propagators did
not allow us to compute the correlation matrix elements Cjk (t) with j, k ∈ {4, 5}, which means that we can only
include the operators O1 to O3 in the GEVP analysis (in contrast, the multi-exponential matrix fitting method does
not require a square matrix and allows us to include O4 and O5 at the sink).
For large time, the eigenvalues λn (t, t0 ) are expected to satisfy
λn (t, t0 ) ∝ e−En t ,

(B2)

where En is the energy of the nth state. We define the effective energy Eeff,n (t) as


1
λn (t, t0 )
Eeff,n (t) = ln
,
a
λn (t + a, t0 )

(B3)

which for large t should plateau at En . An example for Eeff,n (t) is shown in Fig. 13. We determined En from constant
fits to Eeff,n (t) in a suitable range tmin ≤ t ≤ tmax such that χ2 /d.o.f. <
∼ 1. Alternatively, one can fit exponential
functions Ae−En t to the eigenvalues λn (t, t0 ). We performed such fits as cross-checks and found consistent energies
and statistical uncertainties.

FIG. 13. Effective energies aEeff,n for n = 0, 1 obtained for the C005 ensemble by solving the GEVP for the 3 × 3 correlation
matrix Cjk (t) containing operators O1 to O3 . The horizontal lines show the results of constant fits in the regions t/a = 8 . . . 17
(n = 0) and t/a = 8 . . . 14 (n = 1).

We compared the multi-exponential matrix-fit method and the GEVP method by determining the lowest two energy
levels with both methods in the following way:
• We used the same symmetric correlation matrices: 2 × 2 correlation matrices with operators (O1 , O2 ), (O1 , O3 )
and (O2 , O3 ) as well as the 3 × 3 correlation matrix with operators (O1 , O2 , O3 ).
• We used the same values for tmin (larger tmin leads to a stronger suppression of excited states; we performed a
comparison for several values for tmin ).
• We used similar values for tmax (the results only weakly depend on tmax ; we chose tmax as the largest temporal
separation where the signal is not lost in statistical noise).
• We checked that the energy levels obtained by solving the GEVP are independent of the parameter t0 for
t0 /a = 1, 2, . . . , 6 (results shown in the following were obtained with t0 /a = 3).
This comparison is shown in Table XIII for the C005 ensemble. It is reassuring that the results obtained from multiexponential matrix fits and from the GEVP are in excellent agreement (when using the same operator bases). The
two methods were also compared extensively in the study of ππ scattering in Ref. [70], where agreement was also
found.
