ABSTRACT
This paper deals with the explicit design of strategy formulations to make the best
strategic choices from a conventional matrix form of representing strategic choices.
The explicit strategy formulation is an analytical model which is targeted to provide
a mathematical strategy framework to find the best moment for strategy shifting to
prepare rapid market changes. This theoretical model could be adapted into
practically any strategic decision making situation when a strategic formulation is
described as a matrix form with quantitative measured decision parameters.
Analytically tractable results are obtained by using the fluctuation theory and these
results are capable to predict the best moments of changing strategies in a matrix
form. This research helps strategy decision makers who want to find the optimal
moments of shifting present strategies.
Keywords: Strategy; strategy formulation; fluctuation theory; first exceed model;
BCG growth-share matrix; business level strategy

1. INTRODUCTION
The strategy is a set of actions which contains the execution of core competencies and the
collection of competitive advantages. The determination of long-run goals, the adaptation for
series of actions, and the allocation of resources are handled for carrying out strategic goals.
Hence, companies could make choices among competing alternatives as the pathway to
pursue strategic competitiveness by choosing proper strategies. The strategic management is
operating the full set of commitments, decisions, and actions for gaining break-even returns
by achieving strategic competitiveness [1-3]. The strategy formulation is a particular process
to choose the most appropriate strategic actions for realizing objectives and for achieving
visions of a company [4]. Formulation results provide a blueprint of strategic actions to
achieve goals of a company. A strategy formulation forces a company to find the moments of
environment changes and to be ready for shifting strategies [5]. A conventional strategic
1

formulation includes defining a corporate mission, specifying achievable objectives,
developing strategies, and setting policy guidelines [3]. It is also based on the sources of
decision parameters which could develop visions and missions of a company by formulating
one or more strategies with available information [1]. The main contribution provides the
general framework for formulating the strategy which is explicitly designed and
mathematically proven and the theory to determine the explicit probability of the strategy
shifting is also included. This mathematical model explicitly identifies the best moment of
shifting strategic choices and the analytical form could even count one step prior to pass the
thresholds of strategic decision parameters. The fluctuation theory is one of powerful
mathematical tools in the stochastic modeling and the first exceed model is a variation of
conventional fluctuation models [12, 13]. In the fluctuation model [12, 13], the multicompound renewal process evolves until either of the components hit (i.e. reach or exceed)
their assigned levels for the first moment and the associated random variables which include
the first passage time, the first passage level and the termination index. The first exceed level
theory in the fluctuation model has been applied into various applications including the
antagonistic games [14-16], the stochastic defense system [17], the Blockchain Governance
Games [18, 19] and the versatile stochastic duel games [20, 21]. Analytically solved
probability distributions by using the variation of the fluctuation model [13-15] is one of core
contributions of this paper.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
A strategy formulation helps a company to prepare the moment of shifting strategies. As
mentioned in the previous section, strategic formulation tools include the business level
strategy by Porter [7], the product-market matrix by Ansoff [9] and the growth-share matrix
by the Boston Consulting Group [22,23]. The purpose of this section is showing how simple
matrix form could be adapted into various strategic formulations intuitively. It is noted that
actual applications for using strategic formulations will not be covered in this section.
Strategic Group Mapping: Strategic groups are groups of which team members are gathered
by similar strategic characteristics, following similar strategies within an industry or a sector
[2]. The strategic group matrix maps based on the R&D intensity and export focus that
distinguish between strategic groups (see Fig. 1).

Issues Priority Matrix is the matrix form to identify and to analyze developments in the
external environment [3, 6]. The issues priority matrix is applied for helping managers to
decide which environmental trends should be merely scanned (low priority) and which should
be monitored as strategic factors (high priority). The decision parameters are the probable
impacts and the chances of occurrences (see Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. Issues Priority Matrix adapted from Lederman [7]
Value-Creation Diversification Matrix is a matrix form of a corporate-level strategy
specifies actions [1]. Corporate-level strategies help firms to select new strategic positions
and the matrix specifies actions of company to gain a competitive advantage by selecting a
proper strategy. Operational relatedness and corporate relatedness are the decision parameters
to determine a best strategy. The decision parameter of the vertical dimension is an
opportunity to share operational activities between businesses while the horizontal dimension
suggests an opportunity for transferring corporate-level core competencies (see Fig. 5).

BCG Product Portfolio Matrix (aka. Growth-share Matrix): This matrix which is given to
the various segments within their mix of businesses [1] is formulated by the Boston
Consulting Group (BCG) since 1970s [25]. It is targeted to help with long-term strategic
planning, to help a business consider growth opportunities by reviewing its portfolio of
products to decide where to invest, to discontinue or develop products. The decision

3

parameters of the growth-share matrix are rate of market growth and market share and the
matrix plots four strategy in a 2-by-2 matrix form as shown in Fig. 10.

Fig. 10. BCG Product Portfolio Matrix [23]
It is noted a BCG growth-share matrix contains a quantitative scale of each decision
parameter [10]. Therefore, the newly proposed analytical model in the paper could be easily
adapted into this matrix form. Previously mentioned, actual implementation of the
mathematical model into a BCG growth-share matrix is provided in Section 4.
 Dogs (I): The usual marketing advice here is to aim to remove any dogs from
your product portfolio as they are a drain on resources.
 Cows (II): The simple rule here is to "Milk these products as much as possible
without killing the cow!" Often mature, well-established products.
Stars (III): The market leader though require ongoing investment to sustain.
They generate more ROI than other product categories.
 Question Marks (IV): These products often require significant investment to
push them into the star quadrant.

3.2. General Matrix Frameworks for Strategy Formulation
Recalling from the previous section, the matrix form is atypical way to describe the set of
strategic choices based on the decision parameters (i.e., the category of the strategy input) in
the strategy formulation. Most strategy formulation could be described by the matrix. The
section deals the conventional 2-by-2 matrix form to combine the fluctuation theory for
determine the proper strategic decision making. The stakeholder mapping \cite{02} in Fig. 3,
the product-market matrix in Fig. 10, the business level strategy in Fig. 6 and the BCG
product portfolio in Fig. 9 are intuitively described by a 2-by-2 matrix form.

Fig. 11. 2x2 Conventional Strategy Matrix
Generally, the 2-by-2 matrix provides the four strategic choices (I-IV) and the optimal
strategic choice depends on a present or a future position of the company. Let us assume that
the decision parameters are quantitative and the thresholds are exists which are equivalent
with  and  from (3.16)-(3.17). The strategy I becomes be the best when   m, B  
and strategy II is the best when   m, B   Formally speaking, the best strategic choice
could be chosen as follows:

from (3.16)-(3.17). The moment of selecting the strategic choice becomes the critical matter
and the first exceed model could analytically solve when the strategic decision maker takes
the action. Generally, the moment of shifting the strategy is the time when the decision
parameters pass their thresholds   which could be determined analytically from (3.16)
and (3.17). But a strategic choice could be shifted before passing the strategic thresholds
which are  and   instead of the first exceed moments  and  .
3.3. Find The Moment of The Strategy Shifts
It is assumed that the observation process has the memoryless properties which might be a
special condition but very practical for actual implementation on a decision making system. It
implies that the observation process dose not have any dependence with the strategic decision
parameters. Recall from (3.19), the operator is defined as follows:

The marginal mean of  and  are the moment of the strategy chances and it could be

3.4. Useful Tips for Theoretical Modeling
Since we are dealing with the mathematical approach, it is impossible to apply a theoretical
model into a practical implementation without adjustments. Although all strategy
formulations in the literature review are described as a matrix form, not all of them have
quantitative decision parameters. It is noted that all decision parameters should be
quantitative and the thresholds should be measurable to be applied into an analytical model.
Additionally, the scale of decision parameters might be modified for sustaining the linearity
of the decision parameter values. In this newly proposed mathematical strategy formulation
model, it should be assumed that the process for each decision parameter is the Poisson
compound process and this is the most mandatory condition that makes the mathematical

9

model analytically solvable. Instead of the Poisson process, a generally distributed random
process of decision parameters might be considered when the related data are possibly
obtained. Similarly, a numerical approach could be considered instead of an analytical
approach if it is feasible to collecting suitable real data in a certain way. Lastly, the
observation process might have the memoryless properties which implies that the observation
process does not contain any past information.

4. BCG GROWTH-SHARE MATRIX
In the literature review, the BCG growth-share matrix contains the quantitative scale of each
decision parameter. Using the BCG growth-share matrix with the quantitative scale has been
shown in Fig. 12. It is one of intuitive way to portray a company's portfolio strategy [11].
According to Hedley [11], the separating areas of high and low relative competitive position
is set at 1.5 times. If a product has relative strengths of this magnitude to ensure that it will
have the dominant position needed to be Stars or Cows. In the BGC growth-share matrix
model,  represents the transformed random value from the a market share  of a product
(or a company) at -th epoch and  represents a growth rate (%) of a market at -th epoch.
Both are assumed to be monotone nondecreasing until a strategy is shifted. The scale of the
BCG matrix should be modified to adapt the mathematical model and the scale of the relative
competitive position is mapped as follows:


    
  

(4.1)

and the market share  is transformed into the relative competitive ratio with the revised
scale (i.e., the x-axis in Fig. 12) and the modified mapping scale could be shown in Fig. 13.

5. CONCLUSION
The main contribution of this paper is establishing the theoretical framework of the strategy
formulations by providing the explicit forms from a conventional strategy formulation matrix.
The mathematical analysis which includes the explicit functionals for finding the optimal
moments of the strategy shifts and strategy executions are fully deployed in this paper. This
analytical approach supports the theoretical background of the strategic choice to make the
best decisions from advanced mathematical strategy formulations. Additionally, this newly
proposed analytical model has been applied into the BCG growth-share matrix to demonstrate
the actual implementation of the model. This research shall be helpful for whom is looking
for scientific strategy executions in real business matters.
