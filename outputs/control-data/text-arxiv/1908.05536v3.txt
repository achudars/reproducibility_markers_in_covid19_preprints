THE BRAUER INDECOMPOSABILITY OF SCOTT
MODULES WITH SEMIDIHEDRAL VERTEX
SHIGEO KOSHITANI AND İPEK TUVAY

Abstract. We present a sufficient condition for the kG-Scott
module with vertex P to remain indecomposable under the Brauer
construction for any subgroup Q of P as k[Q CG (Q)]-module, where
k is a field of characteristic 2, and P is a semidihedral 2-subgroup
of a finite group G. This generalizes results for the cases where
P is abelian or dihedral. The Brauer indecomposability is defined
by R. Kessar, N. Kunugi and N. Mitsuhashi. The motivation of
this paper is the fact that the Brauer indecomposability of a ppermutation bimodule (p is a prime) is one of the key steps in
order to obtain a splendid stable equivalence of Morita type by
making use of the gluing method due to Broué, Rickard, Linckelmann and Rouquier, that then can possibly be lifted to a splendid
derived (splendid Morita) equivalence.

1. Introduction and notation
Throughout this paper we denote by k an algebraically closed field of
characteristic p > 0 and by G a finite group. For a p-permutation kGmodule M and a p-subgroup P of G, the Brauer construction (Brauer
quotient) M(P ) of M with respect to P plays a very important role. It
canonically becomes a p-permutation module over kNG (P ) (see p.402
in [4]). In their paper [12] Kessar, Kunugi and Mitsuhashi introduce a
notion Brauer indecomposability. Namely, M is called Brauer indecomN (Q)
posable if the restriction module ResQGCG (Q) [M(Q)] is indecomposable
or zero as k[Q CG (Q)]-module for any subgroup Q of P . Actually in
order to get a kind of equivalence between the module categories for
the principal block algebras A and B of the group algebras kG and
kH respectively (where H is another finite group), e.g. in order to
prove Broué’s abelian defect group conjecture, we usually first of all
have to face a situation such that A and B are stably equivalent of

Morita type. In order to get the stable equivalence, we often want to
check whether the k(G×H)-Scott module Sc(G×H, ∆P ) with a vertex
∆P := {(u, u) ∈ P × P } induces a stable equivalence of Morita type
between A and B, where P is a common Sylow p-subgroup of G and
H by making use of the gluing method originally due to Broué (see
[5]), and also Rickard, Linckelmann and Rouquier. If this is the case,
then Sc(G × H, ∆P ) have to be Brauer indecomposable. Therefore it
should be very important to know whether the k(G × H)-Scott module
Sc(G×H, ∆P ) is Brauer indecomposable or not. This is the motivation
why we have written this paper.
Actually, our main results are the following:
Theorem 1.1. Suppose that a finite group G has a semidihedral 2subgroup P . Assume further that the fusion system FP (G) of G over
P is saturated and that CG (Q) is 2-nilpotent for every fully FP (G)normalized non-trivial subgroup Q of P . Then the Scott module Sc(G, P )
is Brauer indecomposable.
Theorem 1.2. Let G and G′ be finite groups with a common Sylow
2-subgroup P which is a semidihedral group, and assume that the two
fusion systems of G and G′ over P are the same, namely FP (G) =
FP (G′ ). Then the Scott module Sc(G × G′ , ∆P ) is Brauer indecomposable.
These theorems in a sense generalize [12, 11, 13, 14], and there are
results on Brauer indecomposability of Scott modules also in [15, 21].
Notation 1.3. Besides the notations explained above we need the
following notations and terminology. In this paper G is always a finite
group, and k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0.
By a kG-module we mean a finitely generated left kG-module unless
stated otherwise. For a kG-module and a p-subgroup P of G the Brauer
construction (Brauer quotient) M(P ) is defined as in §27 of [20] or
p.402 in [4]. For such G and P we write FP (G) for the fusion system
(fusion category) of G over P as in I.Definition 1.1 of [1]. For two
kG-modules M and L, we write L | M if L is (isomorphic to) a direct
summand of M as a kG-module. For a subgroup H of G, a kG-module
M and a kH-module N, we write ResG
H (M) for the restriction module
G
M from G to H, and IndH (N) for the induced module of N from H to
G. For a subgroup H ≤ G we denote the (Alperin-)Scott kG-module
with respect to H by Sc(G, H). By definition, Sc(G, H) is the unique
indecomposable direct summand of IndG
H (kH ) which contains kG in its
top (or equivalently in its socle), where kH and kG are the trivial kH2

and kG-modules, respectively. We refer the reader to §2 of [4] and in
§4.8.4 of [18] for further details on Scott modules.
We write Op′ (G) for the largest normal p′ -subgroup of G, and Z(G)
for the center of G. For x, y ∈ G we set xy := y −1xy and yx := yxy −1.
Further for a subgroup H of G and g ∈ G we set gH := { gh | ∀h ∈ H}.
For two groups K and L we write K ⋊ L for a semi-direct product of
K by L where K ⊳ (K ⋊ L). For a positive integer m, we mean by Cm
and Sm the cyclic group of order m and the symmetric group of degree
m, respectively. Furthermore Q2m for m ≥ 3 and SD2m for m ≥ 4
are the generalized quaternion group of order 2m and the semidihedral
group of order 2m , respectively. In fact more precisely speaking our
main character the semidihedral group SD2n is defined by
n−1

SD2n := hx, y | x2

n−2 −1

= y 2 = 1, y −1 xy = x2

i where n ≥ 4.

We fix the notations x, y and n throughout this paper. We also set
n−2
z := x2 , and hence hzi = Z(SD2n ) ∼
= C2 , see p.191 of [8].
For the other notations and terminologies, see the books [18], [8] and
[1].
The organization of this paper is as follows. In §2 we give several
theorems which have been proved, and also lemmas that are useful of
our aim, and already in §2 we prove our first result Theorem 1.1. In
§3 we prove our second result Theorem 1.2.
2. Preliminaries/Lemma
In this section we list several previous results and lemmas which
are useful to prove our main results. The following results of Ishioka
and Kunugi will be used for showing Brauer indecomposability of Scott
module under consideration.
Theorem 2.1 (Theorem 1.3 of [9]). Assume that P is a p-subgroup of
G and FP (G) is saturated. Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(1) Sc(G, P ) is Brauer indecomposable.
N (Q)
(2) ResQGCG (Q) Sc(NG (Q), NP (Q)) is indecomposable for each fully
FP (G)-normalized subgroup Q of P .
If these conditions are satisfied, then (Sc(G, P ))(Q) ∼
= Sc(NG (Q), NP (Q))
for each fully FP (G)-normalized subgroup Q ≤ P .
Theorem 2.2 (Theorem 1.4 of [9]). Assume that P is a p-subgroup
of G and FP (G) is saturated. Let Q be a fully FP (G)-normalized subgroup of P . Assume further that there exists a subgroup HQ of NG (Q)
satisfying the following conditions:
3

(1) NP (Q) is a Sylow p-subgroup of HQ and
(2) |NG (Q) : HQ | = pa for an integer a ≥ 0.
N (Q)

Then ResQGCG (Q) Sc(NG (Q), NP (Q)) is indecomposable.
The following lemma is essentially a kind of very nice application of
Baer-Suzuki Theorem Theorem 3.8.2 of [8]. It surprisingly does play
an important role not only for [13] but also for our purpose, though
it seems quite elementary. Below, we present a shorter proof than the
proof given in Lemma 4.2 of [13].
Lemma 2.3 (Lemma 4.2 of [13]). Let Q be a normal 2-subgroup of
G such that G/Q ∼
= S3 . Assume further that there is an involution
t ∈ G\Q. Then G has a subgroup H such that t ∈ H ∼
= S3 .
Proof. We first claim that there is an involution y ∈ G\Q which is
different from t.
Assume that there is no such an element. For any g ∈ G we have
tg 6∈ Q since Q E G, and hence tg = t. So that t ∈ Z(G). Moreover,
hQ, ti = Qhti and
Q E Qhti E G.
We observe that Q 6= Qhti and that Qhti =
6 G. Hence Qhti/QEG/Q ∼
=
∼
S3 implies that Qhti/Q = C3 . However, Qhti/Q ∼
= hti/(hti ∩ Q) is a
2-group, which is a contradiction.
Now, we can write G = QK where K = ht, yi. Since K is generated
by the two involutions t and y, K is dihedral. Hence there is an element
x ∈ K such that K = hxi ⋊ hti and that xt = x−1 . Since Q is a 2-group
and G/Q ∼
= S3 , we have 3 | |x|. So there exists an element u which is
a power of x and is of order 3. Then ut = u−1 , so that we can set
H = hu, ti ∼

= S3 .
The following corollary is the corresponding version of Corollary 4.3
in [13] that will be crucial in the proof of our main results. Although
the proof is quite similar, we add it for completeness.
Corollary 2.4. Let P be a semidihedral 2-subgroup of G, and let Q be
a subgroup of P . Assume that either Q ∼
= C2 ×C2 or Q ∼
= Q8 . Assume,
moreover, that CG (Q) is 2-nilpotent and NG (Q)/Q CG (Q) ∼
= S3 . Then
there exists a subgroup HQ of NG (Q) such that NP (Q) is a Sylow 2subgroup of HQ and |NG (Q) : HQ | is a power of 2 (possibly 1).
Proof. Since CG (Q) is 2-nilpotent, the group Q CG (Q) is also 2-nilpotent.
Let K := O2′ (Q CG (Q)) and let R ∈ Syl2 (Q CG (Q)) containing Q CP (Q),
so that Q CG (Q) = K⋊R. Note that since O2′ (Q CG (Q)) = O2′ (CG (Q))
we have [K, Q] = 1 and so K ⋊ Q = K × Q. Note that (K × Q) E (K ⋊
4

NP (Q)). Moreover, since K is a characteristic subgroup of Q CG (Q)
and Q CG (Q) E NG (Q), we have K E NG (Q), so that K × Q E NG (Q).
Let us consider quotients with respect to L := K × Q and use the
notation H for the image of H ≤ G under the natural epimorphism
πL : NG (Q) ։ NG (Q)/L. Then (Q CG (Q)) ∼
= R/Q is a normal 2subgroup of NG (Q) and we have an isomorphism
NG (Q) / (Q CG (Q)) ∼
= NG (Q) / (Q CG (Q)) ∼
= S3 .
Note that, (K ⋊ NP (Q)) ∼
= C2 where the latter isomor= NP (Q)/Q ∼
phism comes from Lemma (viii) of [16]. Note also that,
(K ⋊ NP (Q)) ∩ (Q CG (Q)) = (K ⋊ Q CP (Q)) = 1
where the latter equality is true since CP (Q) = Z(Q) from Lemma (viii)
of [16]. So there is an involution t ∈ NG (Q)\(Q CG (Q)) (in fact there
is one in (K ⋊ NP (Q)) ). Hence, by Lemma 2.3 there is a subgroup H
of NG (Q) such that t ∈ H ∼
= S3 . Set HQ as the preimage of H under
πL . It is easy to see that HQ satisfies the required properties.

Now, we are ready to prove the first main result, namely Theorem
1.1.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Set F := FP (G). We want to prove that M(Q)
is indecomposable as Q CG (Q)-module. It follows from Lemma 4.3(ii)
of [12] that M(P ) is indecomposable as P CG (P )-module. Hence we
can assume that Q  P . From Lemma (i) of [16], P has exactly
three maximal subgroups each of which is either isomorphic to cyclic,
dihedral or generalized quaternion. Hence a fully FP (G)-normalized
subgroup Q of P is isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral or generalized
quaternion. Thus, from Proposition 3.2 (1) of [7] or Lemma 2.1.(i) of
[19], it is easy to see that Aut(Q) is a 2-group unless Q is isomorphic
to C2 × C2 or Q8 .
Suppose that Q ∼
6= C2 × C2 or Q8 . Although the proof for this case
is similar to the second paragraph of the proof of Theorem 1.3 of [13],
we add the details for the convenience of the reader. Since in this case
Aut(Q) is a 2-group, NG (Q)/CG (Q) is also a 2-group. Thus NG (Q) is
2-nilpotent, since CG (Q) is assumed to be 2-nilpotent. So we can write
NG (Q) = K ⋊ S where K := O2′ (NG (Q)) and S is a Sylow 2-subgroup
of NG (Q). Since NP (Q) is a 2-subgroup, without loss of generality we
can assume that NP (Q) ≤ S. Let us set HQ := K ⋊ NP (Q), then
NP (Q) is a Sylow 2-subgroup of HQ and |NG (Q) : HQ | is a power of 2.
Suppose that Q ∼
= S3 and
= C2 × C2 or Q8 . Then Out(Q) ∼
C2 ∼
= NP (Q)/Q CP (Q) ≤ NG (Q)/Q CG (Q) ֒→ Out(Q)
5

where the former isomorphism follows from Lemma (viii) of [16], so
that we have two cases. If NG (Q)/Q CG (Q) ∼
= C2 , we can argue
as in the previous paragraph and get the desired subgroup HQ . If
NG (Q)/Q CG (Q) ∼
= S3 , by Corollary 2.4 we again get HQ with the
desired properties.
Therefore for all possible fully FP (G)-normalized Q, we find the subgroup HQ satisfying the conditions of Theorem 2.2, so we can conclude
that Sc(G, P ) is Brauer indecomposable.

Lemma 2.5. Let P be a subgroup of G which is isomorphic to a semidihedral 2-group such that FP (G) is saturated. If, furthermore, Q is
a fully FP (G)-normalized subgroup of P such that CG (Q) is 2-nilpotent,
N (Q)
then ResQGCG (Q) Sc(NG (Q), NP (Q)) is indecomposable, namely,


NG (Q)
ResQ CG (Q) [Sc(G, P )](Q) is indecomposable.
Proof. This follows from the proof of Theorem 1.1 and the final part
of Theorem 2.1.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.2
The following lemma is used in the proof of our second main result.
Lemma 3.1. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G which is isomorphic
to a semidihedral 2-group. If Q ≤ P with |Q| ≥ 8, then CG (Q) is
2-nilpotent.
n−1

n−2

= y 2 = 1, xy = x2 −1 i where
Proof. Set P := SD2n := hx, y | x2
n−2
n ≥ 4 as before. Note that setting z := x2 , we have that Z(P ) =
hzi ∼
= C2 . If Q contains an element xi 6∈ {1, z}, then CG (Q) is 2nilpotent, because from line −3 on page 246 of [2] we know that for
such xi , CG (xi ) is 2-nilpotent. So, in order to prove the claim, it is
enough to show that if |Q| ≥ 8, then there is an element xi 6∈ {1, z}
which lies in Q.
By Lemma (ii) of [16], the elements xi y has order 2 or 4, when i is
even or odd, respectively. So if Q is cyclic, then it must contain xi
which has order greater or equal to 8, hence the claim is true. So, we
may assume that Q is generated by two elements. We have two cases
for this situation, either Q = hxi y, xj yi or Q = hxκ y, xl i where i, j, κ, l
are integers in the set {1, 2, . . . , 2n−1 } with i 6= j.
In the first case, Q has the element ai,j := (xi y)(xj y) = xi−j z j
inside itself. If both i and j are even, then since z j = 1 we have
that ai,j = xi−j . If xi−j 6∈ {1, z}, we have the result. Otherwise, since
i 6= j, xi−j can not be trivial, hence there is only one possibility left:
xi−j = z, but this implies that (xi y)(xj y) = (xj y)(xi y) = z, hence
6

Q∼
= C2 × C2 contradicting with the assumption |Q| ≥ 8. So xi−j = z
can not happen. If one of i or j is even and the other one is odd,
then ai,j = xi−j z j where i − j is odd. So, in this case ai,j is a nontrivial element in hxi\Z(P ), whence the result. If both i and j are
odd, then ai,j = xi−j z. Similarly, if xi−j 6∈ {1, z}, we have the result.
Otherwise, since i 6= j, there is only one possibility left: xi−j = z. In
this case, (xi y)(xj y) = z.z = 1 so that xi y = (xj y)−1. But this is
impossible because if this holds Q ∼
= C4 contradicting our assumption.
i−j
So x = z can not happen in this case, too.
In the second case, if xl lies outside Z(P ), the result is true. So let
us assume that xl = z (since xl is non-tirivial by the assumptions),
then Q = hxκ y, zi. If κ is even then xκ y is an involution and commutes
with the central involution z, hence hxκ y, zi ∼
= C2 × C2 . This gives a
contradiction with our assumption on Q. If κ is odd, then (xκ y)2 = z,
so Q ∼
= C4 , which is similarly a contradiction with the property of
Q.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Set H := G×G′ . Since P is a Sylow 2-subgroup
of G, F := FP (G) is a saturated fusion system (see Proposition 1.3
of [3]). Moreover since F∆P (H) ∼
= FP (G), we have that F∆P (H) is
saturated.
Let ∆Q ≤ ∆P be any fully F∆P (H)-normalized subgroup of ∆P .
Setting M := Sc(H, ∆P ), we claim that M(∆Q) is indecomposable as
a ∆Q CH (∆Q)-module. Note that CH (∆Q) = CG (Q) × CG′ (Q).
Case 1: |Q| ≥ 8: If Q is a subgroup of P such that |Q| ≥
8, by Lemma 3.1 both CG (Q) and CG′ (Q) are 2-nilpotent. Hence,
CH (∆Q) is also 2-nilpotent. Therefore, by Lemma 2.5 we have that
NH (∆Q)
Res∆Q
CH (∆Q) M(∆Q) or equivalently
N (∆Q)

H
Res∆Q
CH (∆Q) Sc(NH (∆Q), N∆P (∆Q))

is indecomposable for such Q.
Case 2: Either Q ∼
= C4 : Let Q be a fully F = C2 × C2 or Q ∼
normalized subgroup of P such that Q ∼
= C2 × C2 . Since by Lemma
(viii) of [16] there is only one P -conjugacy class of Klein four subgroups
of P , we can assume Q := Z(P ) × hyi. Then, again by Lemma (viii)
of [16], CP (Q) = Q, and by Proposition 2.5 of [17], Q is fully F centralized, so that from Lemma 2.10(i) of [17], Q is a Sylow 2-subgroup
of CG (Q). Hence the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem yields that CG (Q) =
Q × O2′ (CG (Q)), so that CG (Q) is 2-nilpotent. Similarly, CG′ (Q) is
also 2-nilpotent. Thus, CH (∆Q) is also 2-nilpotent. Hence Lemma 2.5
N (∆Q)
implies that ResCHH(∆Q) [M(∆Q)] is indecomposable.
7

Now, let Q be a fully F -normalized subgroup of P such that Q ∼
=
C4 . By Theorem of [16] either all elements of order 4 are G-conjugate
or there are exactly two G-conjugacy classes of elements of order 4.
The same situation holds for G′ -conjugacy classes and hence for F n−3
conjugacy classes. In the first case, hx2 i is a fully F -normalized
representative of the single F -conjugacy class of cyclic subgroups of
n−3
order 4 of P . In the second case, hx2 i and hxyi are representatives
of fully F -normalized subgroups of two F -conjugacy classses of cyclic
n−3
subgroups of order 4 of P . If Q = hx2 i, then line −3 on page 246
of [2] implies that both CG (Q) and CG′ (Q) are 2-nilpotent and hence
CH (∆Q) is a 2-nilpotent subgroup of H. Therefore Lemma 2.5 implies
N (∆Q)
that ResCHH(∆Q) [M(∆Q)] is indecomposable. If Q = hxyi, then since Q
is fully F -normalized, it is fully F -centralized (see Proposition 2.5 of
[17]), and hence by Lemma 2.10 (i) of [17], CP (Q) ∈ Syl2 (CG (Q)), and
similarly CP (Q) ∈ Syl2 (CG′ (Q)). From Lemma (ix) of [16], CP (Q) =
Q, and hence CP (Q) is a normal abelian Sylow 2-subgroup of both
CG (Q) and CG′ (Q). Hence the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem implies that
CG (Q) = Q×O2′ (CG (Q)) and similarly for CG′ (Q). In particular, both
of them are 2-nilpotent. Therefore CH (∆Q) is 2-nilpotent. Thus by
N (∆Q)
Lemma 2.5, we have that ResCHH(∆Q) [M(∆Q)] is indecomposable in this
case, too.
Case 3: Q ∼
= C2 : Let Q be a subgroup of P which is isomorphic to a
cyclic group of order 2. From Theorem in [16], either all involutions in
P are G-conjugate or there are two G-conjugacy classes of involutions
of P represented by z and y. Similar situation holds for G′ -conjugacy
classes and for F -conjugacy classes. Hence, it is enough to prove the
desired result for Q = Z(P ) and for Q = hyi, since they are the fully
F -normalized elements in their own F -conjugacy classes.
Suppose first that Q = Z(P ), then ∆P ≤ NH (∆Q). Suppose also
that M(∆Q) = M1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Mr where r ≥ 1 and Mi are indecomposable NH (∆Q)-modules. From Theorem 4.8.6 (ii)] of [18] we can
set M1 := Sc(NH (∆Q), ∆P ). Since M(∆Q) | ResH
NH (∆Q) (M), we have
H
that Mi | ResNH (∆Q) (M) for each i. Moreover since M | IndH
∆P (k), by
Mackey decomposition we have that for a fixed i ≥ 2,
M
NH (∆Q)
(k)
IndNH
Mi |
(∆Q)∩ h∆P
h

where h runs over representatives of the double cosets in NH (∆Q)\H/∆P
which satisfies ∆Q ≤ h∆P by 1.4 of [4]. Hence a vertex ∆R of Mi lies
in Nh∆P (∆Q) = NH (∆Q) ∩ h∆P for some h. Note that for such h, we
8

have that
∆R ≤ Nh∆P (∆Q) ≤NH (∆Q) ∆P
by Lemma 3.2 of [9]. So, we have that M1 (∆R) 6= 0. On the other
hand, by applying Burry-Carlson-Puig’s Theorem for ∆Q (see Theorem
4.4.6 (ii)] of [18]), each Mi has vertex not equal to ∆Q. Hence ∆Q is
a proper normal subgroup of ∆R and so
M1 (∆R) ⊕ Mi (∆R) | (M(∆Q))(∆R) ∼
= M(∆R)
as NH (∆R) ∩ NH (∆Q)-modules, but CH (∆R) ≤ NH (∆R) ∩ NH (∆Q),
so the isomorphism above restricts to as CH (∆R)-modules which contradicts with the fact that M(∆R) is indecomposable as a CH (∆R)module by Case 1 and Case 2. Therefore, r = 1 and M(∆Q) is indecomposable as a CH (∆Q)-module since CH (∆Q) = NH (∆Q).
Suppose now that Q = hyi, and set S := CP (Q). Then, S =
CP (Q) = NP (Q) = hy, zi ∼
= C2 × C2 . Assume similarly that M(∆Q) =
M1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Mr where Mi are indecomposable NH (∆Q)-modules. By
Lemma 3.1 of [9] and Theorem 1.7 of [10] we can set M1 := Sc(NH (∆Q), ∆S).
Since M | IndH
∆P (k), we have that
M
NH (∆Q)
(k)
IndNH
M(∆Q)
(∆Q)∩ h∆P
h

where h runs over representatives of the double cosets in NH (∆Q)\H/∆P
which satisfies ∆Q ≤ h∆P by 1.4 of [4]. Hence,
M
NH (∆Q)
(k)
IndNH
Mi
(∆Q)∩ h∆P
h

for each i, where h runs through the same set. Hence, for a fixed i, a
vertex of Mi is contained in Nh∆P (∆Q). Note that for such h, we have
that
Nh∆P (∆Q) ≤NH (∆Q) ∆S
by Lemma 3.2 of [9]. So for a fixed i, any vertex of Mi is contained in
∆S. On the other hand, by Lemma 2.1 of [9] and Burry-Carlson-Puig’s
Theorem (see Theorem 4.4.6 (ii) in [18]), a vertex of Mi contains ∆Q
properly. Hence each Mi has a vertex ∆S (Note that |S : Q| = 2).
This implies that Mi (∆S) 6= 0 by (27.7) Corollary in [20]. Therefore,
since ∆Q is normal in ∆S,
M(∆S) ∼
= (M(∆Q))(∆S) = M1 (∆S) ⊕ . . . ⊕ Mr (∆S)
as NH (∆S) ∩ NH (∆Q)-modules. Since CH (∆S) ≤ NH (∆S) ∩ NH (∆Q)
and since we have already proved in Case 2 that M(∆S) is indecomposable as a CH (∆S)-module (recall that S ∼
= C2 × C2 ), we have r = 1,
so M(∆Q) is an indecomposable CH (∆Q)-module.
