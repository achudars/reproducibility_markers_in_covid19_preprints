A BSTRACT. This paper presents a non-trivial two-fold study of the fractional differential cous
s−1
ples - derivatives (∇+0<s<1 = (−∆) 2 ) and gradients (∇−0<s<1 = ∇(−∆) 2 ) of basic importance
in the theory of fractional advection-dispersion equations: one is to discover the sharp HardyRellich (sp < p < n) | Adams-Moser (sp = n) | Morrey-Sobolev (sp > n) inequalities for
∇±0<s<1 ; the other is to handle the distributional solutions u of the duality equations [∇±0<s<1 ]∗ u =
µ (a nonnegative Radon measure) and [∇±0<s<1 ]∗ u = f (a Morrey function).

In his celebrated 1988 paper [3], Adams extends the Moser inequality in [23] from the first
order to the higher order gradients in the Euclidean space Rn≥2 - given the gradient

Clearly, (1.1), (1.3) and (1.4) give a complete structure on utilizing the higher derivatives
and gradients to sharply dominate the size of a derivative/gradient-free function. However,

If φ ∈ Cc∞ , then (2.7) goes back to (2.2)-(2.3)-(2.4) (cf. [32, 8, 20]). Moreover, the above
equalities in (2.6) are well defined because ∇+s and ∇sj send S to S s (cf. [32, 8] for ∇+s and [20,
Lemma 2.6] for ∇sj ).

To see that κsp≥n,− is sharp, we consider two situations below.

4. F RACTIONAL H ARDY-S OBOLEV

SPACES AND THEIR DUALITIES

4.1. Fractional Hardy-Sobolev spaces H s,p and H±s,p . Suppose 0 < s < 1 ≤ p < ∞. Since
both ∇+s u and ∇−s u are well defined when u ∈ S′s , the study for the case p = 1 of (2.5) in [20]
motivates us to consider the fractional Hardy-Sobolev space
n
o
s
H s,p = u ∈ S′s : [u]H s,p = k(−∆) 2 ukH p < ∞ .

Note that

u1 − u2 = constant ⇐⇒ [u1 ]H s,p = [u2 ]H s,p .
So, [·]H s,p is properly a norm on quotient space of H s,p modulo the space of all real constants,
and consequently this quotient space is a Banach space.
Upon introducing
o
n
H±s,p = u ∈ S′s : [u]H±s,p = k∇±s ukL p < ∞ ,
we find immediately
H s,p = H+s,p ∩ H−s,p .
Indeed, as shown in the next theorem, when s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ (1, ∞), these three spaces are
equal to each other and they all have the Schwartz class S and
S∞ = {φ ∈ S : the Fourier transform of φ is 0 near the origin}
as dense subspaces.
Theorem 4.1. Let 0 < s < 1 < p < ∞. Then
S∞ ⊆S ⊆ H s,p = H+s,p = H−s,p .
Moreover, both S∞ and S are dense in H s,p and H±s,p .
s

Proof. Notice that any u ∈ S satisfies (−∆) 2 u ∈ S s (cf. [32]). Of course, any function in S s
belongs to L1<p<∞ . We therefore obtain
S ⊆ H s,p .
Given p ∈ (1, ∞), upon recalling boundedness of the Riesz transforms R j on L p (cf. [35])
and the identity
n
X
id = −
R2j in L p ,
j=1

we achieve

~ f k L p ≈ k f k L p ≈ kR
~ f kL p
k f k L p + kR

∀ f ∈ Lp,

thereby reaching

~
~
2 uk p ≈ k(−∆) 2 uk p ≈ kR(−∆)
2 uk p .
k(−∆) 2 ukL p + kR(−∆)

L
L

This in turn implies
[u]H p,s ≈ [u]H+s,p ≈ [u]H−s,p .
Consequently, we obtain
H s,p = H+s,p = H−s,p .
It suffices to show the density of S∞ in H+s,p . If u ∈ H+s,p , then
s

u ∈ S′s & (−∆) 2 u ∈ L p .
Due to the density of S∞ in L p (cf. the proof of [20, Lemma 2.9(iii)]), we can find a sequence
{ f j } j∈N in S∞ such that
s
lim k f j − (−∆) 2 ukL p = 0.
j→∞

FRACTIONAL DIFFERENTIAL COUPLES BY SHARP INEQUALITIES AND DUALITY EQUATIONS

15

For any j ∈ N, we write
u j = I s f j ∈ S∞ .
Upon noticing
s

f j = (−∆) 2 u j ,
we obtain
s

s

[u j − u]H+s,p = k(−∆) 2 (u j − u)kL p = k f j − (−∆) 2 ukL p → 0

as j → ∞.

Thus, any u ∈ H+s,p can be approximated by the S∞ -functions {u j } j∈N .

4.2. Dual Hardy-Sobolev spaces [H s,p ]∗ and [H±s,p ]∗ . In this subsection, we are about to
show that these dual spaces can be characterized by
p 
n+1
(T 0 , T 1 , . . . , T n ) ∈ L p−1
solving the fractional differential equation

[∇+s ]∗ T 0 = T or [∇−s ]∗ (T 1 , . . . , T n ) = T.
p
Theorem 4.2. Let 0 < s < 1 < p < ∞ and p′ = p−1
. Then for any distribution T ∈ S′ the
following three assertions are equivalent:
(i) T ∈ [H s,p ]∗ = [H+s,p ]∗ = [H−s,p ]∗ ;
′
(ii) ∃ T 0 ∈ L p such that T = [∇+s ]∗ T 0 in S′ ;
′
(iii) ∃ (T 1 , . . . , T n ) ∈ (L p )n such that T = [∇−s ]∗ (T 1 , . . . , T n ) in S′.

Proof. Note that Theorem 4.1 implies
[H s,p ]∗ = [H+s,p ]∗ = [H−s,p ]∗ .

(4.1)

So, we begin with showing that (ii) implies (i) by considering H+s,p . If (ii) is valid, i.e., if
′

T = [∇+s ]∗ T 0 in S′ for some T 0 ∈ L p ,
then
s

hT, φi = h[∇+s ]∗ T 0 , φi = hT 0 , ∇+s φi = hT 0 , (−∆) 2 φi

∀ φ ∈ S,

and hence
s

|hT, φi| ≤ kT 0 kL p′ k(−∆) 2 φkL p = kT 0 kL p′ [φ]H+s,p

∀ φ ∈ S.

Accordingly, using the density of S in H+s,p , we see that T induces a bounded linear functional
on H+s,p . This proves that
T ∈ [H+s,p ]∗
and (i) holds due to (4.1).
Conversely, in order to show that (i) implies (ii), upon assuming
T ∈ [H+s,p ]∗ ,
we are required to find
′

T 0 ∈ L p such that T = [∇+s ]∗ T 0 in S′.
Inspiring by [7, Proposition 1, pp. 399-400], we consider the operator

Evidently, the above-defined linear operator A+ is bounded and hence closed. Thus, if

LIGUANG LIU AND JIE XIAO

then
s

(−∆) 2 u = 0 almost everywhere on Rn ,
and hence
s

u = Is (−∆) 2 u ≡ 0 on Rn .
This in turn implies that the operator A+ is injective. Moreover, due to
s

kA+ ukL p = k(−∆) 2 ukL p = [u]H+s,p ,
the operator A+ has actually a continuous inverse from L p to H+s,p . Accordingly, by the closed
range theorem (see [40, p. 208, Corollary 1]), we know that the adjoint operator

A∗+ : L p → [H+s,p ]∗ defined by hA∗+ F, ui = hF, A+ ui ∀ (F, u) ∈ L p × H+s,p ,
is surjective. In particular, if
T ∈ [H+s,p ]∗ ,
then there exists

T 0 ∈ L p such that A∗+ T 0 = T.
Consequently, for any φ ∈ S, we have

hA∗+ T 0 , φi = hT 0 , A+ φi = hT 0 , (−∆) 2 φi = h[∇+s ]∗ T 0 , φi,
namely,
T = A∗+ T 0 = [∇+s ]∗ T 0 in S′ .
This completes the argument for that (i) implies (ii).
Next, we show that (iii) implies (i) by considering H−s,p . If
′
T = [∇−s ]∗ T~ in S′ for some T~ = (T 1 , . . . , T n ) ∈ (L p )n ,

we are about to verify that

T = [∇−s ]∗ T~ = (T 1 , . . . , T n ) in S′ for some T~ ∈ (L p )n .

To this end, we consider the bounded linear operator
A− : H−s,p → (L p )n via u 7→ ∇−s u.
Now we validate that the just-defined operator A− is injective. If

This, along with the density of S∞ in L p (cf. the proof of [20, Lemma 2.9(iii)]), further gives
u = 0 in L p & a. e. =⇒ u = 0 in H−s,p .
Accordingly, A− is an injective map from H−s,p onto A− (H−s,p ) (the closed range of A− ) ⊆ (L p )n .
This, along with
kA− ukL p = k∇−s ukL p = [u]H−s,p ,
ensures that A− has a continuous inverse from A− (H−s,p ) to H−s,p . Upon applying the closed

We can also show that the operator A is injective. To this end, assuming that u ∈ X satisfies

deduce that the adjoint operator
~ ui = hF,
~ Aui ∀ (F,
~ u) ∈ [A(X)]∗ × X.
A∗ : [A(X)]∗ → X ∗ via hA∗ F,
is surjective.
Next, we validate that any f ∈ L p,κ belongs to X ∗ . Indeed, for any φ ∈ S ∩ X, we apply [30,
Theorem 1.12] to write
 n

φ = Is  R j ∇sj φ .

Also, using φ ∈ S, we derive from [20, Lemma 2.6] that ∇sj φ ∈ S s , which easily implies that
R j ∇sj φ is continuous on Rn . From the fact

it follows that

the function

is strictly increasing on the interval (0, s] and ψ(s) = 0. By (5.8), [17, Theorem 1.1] and its
remark, we can derive the continuity of the mapping

Due to the density of S ∩ X in X, we arrive at the conclusion that f induces a bounded linear
functional on X.
To continue, like proving Theorem 4.2(iii) we use the surjective property of A∗ and the
Hahn-Banach extension theorem to obtain
F~ = (F 1 , . . . , F n ) ∈ Y ∗ = (Lip s− κ )n

such that
~ φi = hF,
~ Aφi = hF,
~ ∇−s φi = h[∇−s ]∗ F,
~ φi ∀ φ ∈ S,
h f, φi = hA∗ F,
whence
[∇−s ]∗ F~ = A∗ F~ = f in S′ .
Part 2 - the case sp < κ.
This part is similar to the case sp ≥ κ. To be precise, we take

Again, observing that kukX = 0 if and only if u is a constant, we also understood this X as a
quotient space. Though we do not know if S ∩ X is dense in X, we use the space X̊ which is
the closure of S ∩ X in X.
Still we consider the operator
A : X̊ → Y via u 7→ A(u) = ∇−s u,
and can show that A is injective and has a continuous inverse from A(X̊) (the close range of A)
to X̊. Consequently, the closed range theorem (cf. [40, p. 208, Corollary 1]) can be applied to
derive that the adjoint operator

Next, we validate that any f ∈ L p,κ belongs to (X̊)∗ . Applying [19, Proposition 5.1] gives
the continuity of the mapping

Note that the boundedness of R j on Hq ,q( p −s) is given in [4, Chapter 8]. So, upon using (5.7)
and the Fubini theorem, we derive that any φ ∈ S ∩ X satisfies

This implies that f can be extended to a bounded linear functional on X̊, that is, f ∈ (X̊)∗ .
Because of f ∈ (X̊)∗ and the surjective property of A∗ , we can borrow the idea of verifying
Theorem 4.2(iii) and use the Hahn-Banach extension theorem to find a vector-valued function
