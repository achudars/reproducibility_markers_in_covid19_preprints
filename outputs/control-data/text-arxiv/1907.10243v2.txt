overview can shed light to MDPs in queues and networks, and also to their extensive
applications in various practical areas.

Introduction
One main purpose of this paper is to provide an overview for research on MDPs in

queues and networks in the last six decades. Also, such a survey is first related to several
other basic studies, such as, Markov processes, queueing systems, queueing networks,
Markov decision processes, sensitivity-based optimization, stochastic optimization, fluid
and diffusion control. Therefore, our analysis begins from three simple introductions:
1

Markov processes and Markov decision processes, queues and queueing networks, and
queueing dynamic control.
(a) Markov processes and Markov decision processes
The Markov processes, together with the Markov property, were first introduced by
a Russian mathematician: Andrei Andreevich Markov (1856-1922) in 1906. See Markov
[238] for more details. From then on, as a basically mathematical tool, the Markov processes have extensively been discussed by many authors, e.g., see some excellent books by
Doob [99], Karlin [175], Karlin and Taylor [176], Chung [80], Anderson [21], Kemeny et
al. [181], Meyn and Tweedie [241], Chen [77], Ethier and Kurtz [110] and so on.
In 1960, Howard [165] is the first to propose and discuss the MDP (or stochastic dynamic programming) in terms of his Ph.D thesis, which opened up a new and important
field through an interesting intersection between Markov processes and dynamic programming (e.g., see Bellman and Kalaba [32]). From then on, not only are the MDPs an
important branch in the area of Markov processes, but also it is a basic method in modern
dynamic control theory. Crucially, the MDPs have been greatly motivated and widely
applied in many practical areas in the past 60 years. Readers may refer to some excellent
books, for example, the discrete-time MDPs by Puterman [261], Glasserman and Yao [143],
Bertsekas [33], Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis [34], Hernádez-Lerma and Lasserre [155, 156], Altman [9], Koole [193] and Hu and Yue [166]; the continuous-time MDPs by Guo and
Hernández-Lerma [145]; the partially observable MDPs by Cassandra [67] and Krishnamurthy [196]; the competitive MDPs (i.e., stochastic game) by [127]; the sensitivity-based
optimization by Cao [58]; some applications of MDPs by Feinberg and Shwartz (Eds.) [122]
and Boucherie and Van Dijk (Eds.) [44]; and so on.
(b) Queues and queueing networks
In the early 20th century, a Danmark mathematician: Agner Krarup Erlang, published
a pioneering work [109] of queueing theory in 1909, which started the study of queueing
theory and traffic engineering. Over the past 100 years, queueing theory has been regarded as a key mathematical tool not only for analyzing practical stochastic systems
but also for promoting theory of stochastic processes (such as Markov processes, semiMarkov processes, Markov renew processes, random walks, martingale theory, fluid and
diffusion approximation, and stochastic differential equations). On the other hand, the
theory of stochastic processes can support and carry forward advances in queueing theory
and applications (for example single-server queues, multi-server queues, tandem queues,
2

parallel queues, fork-join queues, and queueing networks). It is worthwhile to note that
so far queueing theory has been widely applied in many practical areas, such as manufacturing systems, computer and communication networks, transportation networks, service
management, supply chain management, sharing economics, healthcare and so forth.
The single-server queues and the multi-server queues: In the early development of
queueing theory (1910s to 1970s), the single-server queues were a main topic with key
results including Khintchine formula, Little’s law, birth-death processes of Markovian
queues, the embedded Markov chain, the supplementary variable method, the complex
function method and so on. In 1969, Professor J.W. Cohen published a wonderful summative book [81] with respect to theoretical progress of single-server queues.
It is a key advance that Professor M.F. Neuts proposed and developed the phasetype (PH) distributions, Markovian arrival processes (MAPs), and the matrix-geometric
solution, which were developed as the matrix-analytic method in the later study, e.g.,
see Neuts [245, 246] and and Latouche and Ramaswami [210] for more details. Further, Li [218] proposed and developed the RG-factorizations for any generally irreducible
block-structured Markov processes. Crucially, the RG-factorizations promote the matrixanalytic method to a unified matrix framework both for the steady-state solution and
for the transient solution (for instance the first passage time and the sojourn time). In
addition, the matrix-analytic method and the RG-factorizations can effectively deal with
small-scale stochastic models with several nodes.
In the study of queueing systems, some excellent books include Kleinrock [184, 185],
Tijms [304] and Asmussen [23]. Also, an excellent survey on key queueing advances was
given in Syski [302]; and some overview papers on different research directions were reported by top queueing experts in two interesting books by Dshalalow [104, 105].
The queueing networks: In 1957, J.R. Jackson published a seminal paper [168] which
started research on queueing networks. Subsequent interesting results include Jackson
[169], Baskett et al. [29], Kelly [178, 180], Disney and König [97], Dobrushin et al. [98],
Harrison [152], Dai [86] and so on. For the queueing networks, the well-known examples
contain Jackson networks, BCMP networks, parallel networks, tandem networks, open networks, closed networks, polling queues, fork-join networks and distributed networks. Also,
the product-form solution, the quasi-reversibility and some approximation algorithms are
the basic results in the study of queueing networks.
For the queueing networks, we refer readers to some excellent books such as Kelly [179],
3

Van Dijk [310], Gelenbe et al. [138], Chao et al. [72], Serfozo [284], Chen and Yao [76],
Balsamo et al. [27], Daduna [85], Bolch et al. [41] and Boucherie and Van Dijk (Eds.) [43].
For applications of queueing networks, readers may refer to some excellent books,
for example, manufacturing systems by Buzacott and Shanthikumar [52], communication
networks by Chang [71], traffic networks by Garavello and Piccoli [133], healthcare by
Lakshmi and Iyer [206], service management by Demirkan et al. [92] and others.
(c) Queueing dynamic control
In 1967, Miller [242] and Ryokov and Lembert [277] are the first to apply the MDPs
to consider dynamic control of queues and networks. Those two works opened a novel
interesting research direction: MDPs in queues and networks.
For MDPs of queues and networks, we refer readers to three excellent books by Kitaev
and Rykov [182], Sennott [282] and Stidham [298].
In MDPs of queues and networks, so far there have been some best survey papers, for
instance, Crabill et al. [83, 84], Sobel [289], Stidham and Prabhu [299], Rykov [272, 274],
Kumar [198], Stidham and Weber [300], Stidham [296] and Brouns [50].
For some Ph.D thesises by using MDPs of queues and networks, reader may refer to,
such as, Farrell [114], Abdel-Gawad [1], Bartroli [28], Farrar [112], Veatch [314], Altman [7],
Atan [25] and Efrosinin [107].
Now, MDPs of queues and networks play an important role in dynamic control of many
practical stochastic networks, for example, inventory control [54, 116, 117], supply chain
management [111], maintenance and quality [95, 200], manufacturing systems [52, 172],
production lines [323], communication networks [6, 11, 251], wireless and mobile networks
[4,96], cloud service [301], healthcare [254], airport management [211,271], energy-efficient
management [250, 262] and artificial intelligence [188, 287]. With rapid development of
Internet of Things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, blockchain and artificial intelligence,
it is necessary to discuss MDPs of queues and networks under an intelligent environment.
From the detailed survey on MDPs of queues and networks, this paper suggests a
future research under an intelligent environment from three different levels as follows:
1. Networks with several nodes: Analyzing MDPs of policy-based Markov processes
with block structure, for example, QBD processes, Markov processes of GI/M/1 type,
and Markov processes of M/G/1 type, and specifically, discussing their sensitivitybased optimization.
4

2. Networks with a lot of nodes: discussing MDPs of practical big networks, such as
blockchain systems, sharing economics, intelligence healthcare and so forth.
3. Networks with a lot of clusters: studying MDPs of practical big networks by means
of the mean-field theory, e.g., see Gast and Gaujal [134], Gast et al. [135] and Li [219].
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 to 5 provide an overview
for MDPs of single-server queues, multi-server queues, queueing networks, and queueing
networks with special structures, respectively. Section 6 sets up specific objectives to
provide an overview for key objectives in queueing dynamic control. Section 7 introduce
the sensitivity-based optimization and the event-based optimization, both of which are
applied to analyze MDPs of queues and networks. Finally, we give some concluding
remarks in Section 8.

ing dynamic control, for example, input control, service control, dynamic control under
different service mechanisms, dynamic control with pricing, threshold control and so forth.
Objective one: Input control
The input control is to apply the MDPs to dynamically control the input process
of customers in the queues and networks, including the input rate control, the interval
time control, and the admission access control (e.g., probability that an arriving customer
chooses entering the system or some servers).

on.

it is a precondition that sets up useful relations among key customers, segmenting market
and adhering to long-term cooperation. Note that the priority makes dynamic control of
queues with multi-class customers. Readers may refer to Rykov and Lembert [277], Crabill

The optimal pricing policy is an important research direction in dynamic control of
queues and networks, e.g., see literature Low [229], Chen and Frank [74], Yoon and Lewis
[340], Çelik and Maglaras [69], Economou and Kanta [106], Yildirim and Hasenbein [339],
Feinberg and Yang [125], Bradford [45], Xia and Chen [327] and Federgruen and Zheng
[116].

Sensitivity-Based Optimization for MDPs of Queueing
Networks
In this section, we simple introduce the sensitivity-based optimization in the MDPs,

and then provide an overview on how to apply the sensitivity-based optimization in dynamic control of queues and networks.
In the late 1980s, to study dynamic control of queueing systems, Professors Yu-Chi
Ho and Xi-Ren Cao proposed and developed the infinitesimal perturbation method for
discrete event dynamic systems (DEDS), which is a new research direction for online
simulation optimization of the DEDS. See [158] for more interpretation. Further excellent
books include Glasserman [142], Cao [56] and Cassandras and Lafortune [68].
Sensitivity-Based Optimization: Cao et al. [66] and Cao and Chen [65] published
a pioneer work that transforms the infinitesimal perturbation of DEDS, together with
the MDPs, into the so-called sensitivity-based optimization by means of the policy-based
Markov processes and the associated Poisson equations, in which they also developed
12

new concepts, for example, performance potential, and performance difference equation.
On this research line, Cao [58] summarized many basic results of the sensitivity-based
optimization. In addition, Li and Liu [223] and Chapter 11 in Li [218] extended and
generalized the sensitivity-based optimization to a more general perturbed Markov process
with infinite states by means of the RG-factorizations.
So far some work has applied the sensitivity-based optimization to deal with MDPs of
queues and networks, e.g., see Xia and Cao [326], Xia and Shihada [331], Xia [324], Xia and
Jia [329], Xia et al. [328] and Xia and Chen [327]; Ma et al. [233,234] for data centers; and
Li et al. [222] for inventory rationing control. It is worthwhile to note that the sensitivitybased optimization of queues and networks can be effectively supported and developed
by means of the matrix-analytic method by Neuts [245,246] and the RG-factorizations by
Li [218]. Also see Ma et al. [233, 234] and Li et al. [222] for more details.
Recently, Xi-Ren Cao further extended and generalized the sensitivity-based optimization to the more general case of diffusion processes, called relative optimization of
continuous-time and continuous-state stochastic systems (see Cao [62] with a complete
draft). Important examples include Cao [59–61, 63, 64] and references therein.
Event-Based Optimization Approach: In many practical systems, an event usually has a specific physical meaning and can mathematically correspond to a set of state
transitions with the same characteristics. In general, the number of events from change
of system states is much smaller than the state number of the system. Therefore, such
an event can be used to describe an approximate MDP, hence this sets up a new optimal
framework, called event-based optimization. The event-based optimization can directly
capture the future information and the structure nature of the system, which are reflected
in the event to aggregate performance potential. Note only can the event-based optimization greatly save the calculation, but also it alleviates the dimensional disaster of a
network decision process.
For the event-based optimization, readers may refer to, for example, dynamic control
of queueing systems by Koole [190] and Koole [195]; dynamic control of Markov systems by
Cao [57], Cao [53], Xia [330] and Jia [171]; partially observable Markov decision processes
by Wang and Cao [318]; and admission control of open queueing networks by Xia [325].

Concluding Remarks
In this survey, we provide an overview for the MDPs of queues and networks, including

single-server queues, multi-server queues and queueing networks. At the same time, the
overview is also related to some specific objectives, for example, input control, service
control, dynamic control based on different service mechanisms, dynamic control based on
pricing, threshold control and so on.
Along such a line, there are still a number of interesting directions for potential future
research, for example:
• Developing effective and efficient algorithms to find the optimal polices and to compute the optimal performance measures, and also probably linking AI and learning algorithms;
• discussing structure properties of the optimal policy in the MDPs of queueing networks under intelligent environment (for example, IoT, big data, cloud service, blockchain
and AI), and specifically, dealing with multi-dimensional queueing dynamic control;
• analyzing structure properties of the optimal policy in the MDPs with either QBD
processes, Markov processes of GI/M/1 type or Markov processes of M/G/1 type, which
are well related to various practical stochastic models.
• applying the sensitivity-based optimization and the event-based optimization to deal
with dynamic control of practical stochastic networks, for example, production and inventory control, manufacturing control, transportation networks, healthcare, sharing economics, cloud service, blockchain, service management, energy-efficient management and
so forth.
