Abstract
In this paper we study the correspondence between a field theory in de Sitter space in D-dimensions
and a dual conformal field theory in a euclidean space in (D − 1)-dimensions. In particular, we investigate
the form in which this correspondence is established for a system of interacting scalar and a vector fields
propagating in de Sitter space. We analyze some necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for which conformal symmetry is preserved in the dual theory in (D − 1)-dimensions, making possible the establishment of
the correspondence. The discussion that we address on this paper is framed on the context of inflationary
cosmology, so, the results obtained here pose some relevant possibilities of application to the calculation
of the fields’s correlation functions and of the primordial curvature perturbation ζ, in inflationary models
including coupled scalar and vector fields.
Keywords: Inflation; vector fields; de Sitter symmetries; parity violation.

Introduction

in the sense that it is a maximally symmetric space,
which means that in D dimensions, the number of
symmetry generators is D(D + 1)/2. This fact defines
and restricts the form of the kinematic features and
the evolution of a system on this space. During the inflationary period the symmetries of the de Sitter group
play an essential role on the description of the primordial perturbations and their statistical properties. In
particular, by using the correspondence between the
de Sitter symmetry group in D-dimensions and the
conformal group in an euclidean (D − 1)-dimensional
“boundary” space [1], it is possible to calculate general
important features of the system, such as the correla-

The study of the symmetries is very important when
we look for fundamental descriptive features of a particular physical system and solve its dynamics, for example, it is well known that through the Noether theorem we can identify conserved quantities related to
the symmetries, which allows us to discover intrinsic
fundamental characteristics that will be reflected on
the dynamics of the system. It is also well known that
the geometry of the inflationary period of our universe
is described with great accuracy by the de Sitter space.
This spacetime is similar to the Minkowski spacetime

tions functions of the fields that govern the dynamics
of the inflationary Universe [2], which are necessary to
calculate the statistical descriptors of the primordial
curvature perturbation by using, for example, the δN
formalism [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] or cosmological perturbation
theory [8, 9] . To do that, we need first to calculate
one of the fundamental quantities of the conformal
field theory description: the conformal weights of the
fields.
The correspondence between a field theory in de
Sitter space and a dual theory in a euclidean boundary space, one dimension less than the de Sitter space,
is what we shall refer to as dS/CFT correspondence
and it is at the core of the approach that we are pursuing here. This correspondence was proposed initially
for free non interacting single fields propagating on de
Sitter space [10] but some considerations about the
interacting case was discussed in the literature [11].
In this paper, we follow the approach proposed by [2]
to study the case of a coupled scalar-vector system.
In the context that we are framing our discussion, the
scalar field is responsible for the inflationary expansion
and the vector field is partly responsible of the generation of the primordial curvature perturbation ζ. The
inclusion of vector fields on the inflationary dynamics
permits the study of several interesting possibilities
such as the presence of statistical anisotropies, parity
violating patterns, the origin of primordial magnetic
fields, etc. (see for instance [12, 13, 14, 15] and references therein). For concreteness we will settle the
discussion in four dimensional de Sitter space but the
results obtained can be generalised straightforwardly
to any dimensions.
This paper is organized as follows. In section II
we review the symmetries and some basics of de Sitter
space. Next, on sections III and IV we shall describe
the transformation laws imposed by these symmetries
over the conformal fields on the dual theory and we
calculate the associated conformal weights of those
fields. In section V we briefly review the results for
the scalar and the vector field separately and then, in
section VI we consider the coupled scalar-vector system. Finally, in section VII we present our conclusions
and discuss some possible applications of the results
obtained.

is written as

(1)
ds2 =

(Hτ )

where H is the Hubble parameter and τ is the conformal time. In this coordinate system it is easy to
see that the line element (1) is invariant under spacial
translations and rotations on τ = constant sections:
x′i = ai + Rij xj ,

(2)

where ai is a 3-dimensional constant vector and Rij is
an O(3) matrix satisfying the condition Rik Rkj = δij
and representing a three dimensional rotation. We
have a total of six symmetry generators included in
the transformation (2) and they affect only the spacial sections of the spacetime. Notice also that we
allow the possibility of spacial reflexion xi → −xi in
this group of transformations. Spacial reflexion is an
explicit symmetry of the line element (1) and we will
pay attention to this specific transformation, when we
consider the possibility of introducing parity violating
models in the presence of vector fields. There are two
additional transformation which mixes the time and
the spacial coordinates, the spacetime dilatation:
x′µ = λxµ →

x′i = λxi ,

τ → τ ′ = λτ,

where λ is a constant factor and the special conformal

with bµ = (0, bi ) a three dimensional vector which
generates the transformation. In the last expressions we use the notation x2 = ηµν xµ xν , ηµν =
diag(−1, 1, 1, 1), ~x2 = δij xi xj and ~x · ~b = δij bi xj . Together, the transformations (2), (3) and (4) tell us
that de Sitter space has ten symmetry generators, so,
this is a maximally symmetric spacetime. It can be
seen that (4) is constructed out by the composition of
2 Symmetries of the de Sitter three consecutive transformations, namely, an inversion, written as

It becomes useful in the following to have the Jacobian

of the de Sitter isometries. Particularly, we will need
the Jacobian for the dilatation and for special conformal transformation (3) and (4). Nevertheless, as
we said before, the special conformal transformation
can be obtained by composing translations and inversions, then, we use the transformation (6) instead of
(4). The Jacobian matrix of the inversion, can be derived directly for (6) obtaining

some basis of the conformal group and introduce the
relevant terminology that will allow us to construct a
conformal field theory representation of the fields in de
Sitter space. An important part of the following discussion is devoted to the conformal weight of the fields
in the conformal field theory representation. The conformal weight of the field is a crucial element for expressing the transformation rules of the fields and the
symmetries of their correlation functions which are the
meaningful objects constructed in the theory because
they encode the statistical properties of the theory.

So far we were talking about the symmetries and the transformation of the fields. To emphasise the differgeometry of the spacetime, and now we turn to the ence between the properties of the scalar field in de

for the conformal field theory description, are the ones the transformation law for a scalar in de Sitter as in

where n is the order of the tensor, d is the dimension of the spacetime and ∆T is the conformal
weight of the field [2]. When dealing with the conformal dual theory to the theory in de Sitter space,
we will consider the Euclidean space R3 . By using
the above transformation, we can find the conformal
dimension ∆T of different fields that are involved in
the theory. It is beyond the scope of this short article
to enter in the details of the conformal field theory
machinery, we will just restrict to the introduction of
the fundamental elements necessary for our purpose.
A complete study of conformal field theory can be
found for instance in [19].

where we have used ∂µ′ = x2 Jµν ∂ν . Demanding invariance of the action Sφ = Sφ′ we see that it is necessary
to set ∆φ = 0, and then φ′ = φ. It is easy to arrive
to the same result if we apply the dilatation (3) and
it is trivial for the translations and three dimensional
rotations (2) because the transformation matrix is orthogonal. Certainly, this result does not come as a
surprise at all, since we are talking about of a scalar
field. Nevertheless it is worth to stress this fact because we are going to see that asymptotically, in the
super horizon limit the dual field associated to the
scalar transform according with (20) with a conformal
weight different than ∆φ = 0.
Now, we study the behaviour of the associated conformal field of the scalar filed in the three dimensional
space R3 . To this end it is necessary to solve the equation of motion and go to super horizon scales. The
equation of motion derived from (21) is

Fields on de Sitter space

Now we study of fields propagating on de Sitter space.
With the results obtained in the previous section we
can evaluate the conformal weight, which is an essential quantity necessary for the conformal field theory
description of the fields. We are interested in the coupled scalar vector system, but, before that, and mainly
for illustrative reasons and for developing the technique introducing the necessary elements, we study
the single scalar field and the single vector field cases
separately. After that and invoking the results from
the single field case, we will face the coupled system.

The field σ is the one that we need to construct the
dual conformal theory for late times after horizon
crossing, so, we need to determine if it behave as a
conformal field by deriving its transformation under
conformal transformations in R3 , actually, as we comment before, we just need the transformation for dilatations (3) and inversions (6) in 3D. Before that, we
need to take the super horizon limit |τ | ≪ |~x| of the
inversion (6): τ ′ = |~xτ|2 , x′i = |~xx|i2 . Using φ′ = φ, and

And we consider the asymptotic symmetries of dilatations and inversion. The result is the same for both
symmetries as in the scalar field, and then we only
show the transformation law of the boundary field Ui
under dilatations. Taking into account the transformation law for the vector field:

from which we deduce that invariance under inversions implies that ∆A = 1. Again, this is not surprising since this is precisely the transformation law for a
vector in four dimensional de Sitter space.
Now, we look if there is an associated three dimensional vector which transforms as a conformal vector
field in R3 . We begin by solving the equations of motion derived from the action (36)

The system before propagate three degrees of freedom
due to the presence of the mass term, two transverse
terms perpendicular to the propagation axis, and a
longitudinal term for the equation of the component
A0 . It is well known that the longitudinal mode in
this model is problematic due to the presence of ghost
instabilities ([23], [24]), but it is also known that this
problem can be solved by introducing a time dependent coupling in the Maxwell term f (τ )F 2 and a time
dependent mass term m(τ ) ([25], [26]).We avoid the
analysis of the longitudinal mode which is not relevant for our main objectives here, we refer the reader
to the references mentioned before and in the following we just focus on the transverse components that
can be obtained from the divergence free spacial components (∂i Ai = 0) 1 :

section we discuss coupled system involving a scalar
and a vector field which results useful for applications
in inflationary cosmology and analyse in which conditions it is possible to extend the ideas explored in
previous sections and if it is possible to find a conformal field theory representation of the theory aiming to
calculate the properties of inflationary perturbations
by using the conformal field theory machinery.

The equations of motion for the vector field derived
from the action (48) are:

(50)
∇µ f1 (φ)F µν + f2 (φ)F̃ µν = 0,

which must be complemented with the Bianchi identity:
(51)
∇µ F̃ µν = 0.

We don’t solve the dynamics of the scalar field, we
just assume some features of its solutions due to the
fact that this field drives the inflationary expansion.
Accordingly, we further assume that the inflationary
dynamics homogenise the scalar perturbations, so that
we can approximate the scalar field as a time dependent function, this is ∂i φ = 0. Accordingly, this implies that on the solutions of the inflationary scalar
field f1 (φ) = f1 (φ(τ )) and f2 (φ) = f2 (φ(τ )), then
∂i f1 = ∂i f2 = 0. With this approximation, the temporal and spacial components of the equation (50) in de
Sitter conformal coordinates (1) become respectively

Vector-scalar coupled system.

In this section we study a system of interacting scalar
and vector fields which results useful for several applications to inflationary cosmology [27, 25, 28, 26, 29,
30, 31, 32, 33, 9, 34, 35, 36, 37, 12, 38, 39, 40]. The
model that we consider here is described by the action

Now, given that this theory is manifestly gauge invariant because it only depend of the field strength Fµν
and its dual F̃ µν , we choose the Coulomb gauge and
set A0 = 0 and ∂i Ai = 0. With this choice, the temporal equation equation (52) cancels and the spatial
part (53) reduces to:

where ǫµναβ is the four dimensional Levi-Civita symbol and f1 (φ) and f2 (φ) are coupling functions which
depend only of the scalar field. This model introduces explicitly parity violation through the term
f2 (φ)F̃ µν Fµν . We assume the results obtained previously for the conformal weight of the scalar and
the vector field in four dimensional de Sitter, this is
∆φ = 0 and ∆A = 1 so that the action (48) is manifestly invariant under de Sitter group transformations.
Additionally, assuming ∆φ = 0 imply that if we assign
some conformal weight ∆fi to the coupling functions

So far, we don’t have any restriction over the form of
the coupling functions fi , and now we impose some
conditions mainly, to preserve conformal invariance
on the asymptotic region. Let’s apply the dilatation
τ ′ = λτ and ~x′ = λ~x to the previous equation and demand invariance under this transformation. We further assume that the coupling functions are homogeneous functions of time, this is f1 (λτ ) = λn f1 (τ ),
f2 (λτ ) = λm f2 (τ ), so that the equation of motion
transforms as:

we get that ∆fi = 0 in order to preserve de Sitter invariance.
Now, we proceed as in previous sections, we solve the
equations of motion and study its super horizon evolution. In the context that we frame the discussion we
consider that the scalar field drives the inflationary
dynamics and that the vector field is an auxiliary subdominant field which affects the primordial curvature
perturbation and can leave an imprint on the inflationary evolution. The scalar affect the evolution of In this way we see that a necessary condition for getthe vector field through the coupling functions fi (φ). ting scaling invariance is that the coupling functions
