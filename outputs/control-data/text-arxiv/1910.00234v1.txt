We present the relation between the sphaleron energy and the gravitational wave signals from
a first order electroweak phase transition. The crucial ingredient is the scaling law between the
sphaleron energy at the temperature of the phase transition and that at zero temperature. We
estimate the baryon number preservation criterion, and observe that for a sufficiently strong phase
transition, it is possible to probe the electroweak sphaleron using measurements of future spacebased gravitational wave detectors.

The electroweak sphaleron is a static but unstable solution to the classical equations of motion of the EW theory, which corresponds to a saddle-point configuration in
the field space and sits at the top of the potential barrier
between two topologically distinct vacua with adjacent
values of the Chern-Simons number [7, 8]. To calculate
the energy of the sphaleron configuration, we adopt the
spherically symmetric antasz since the U(1)Y contribution is sufficiently small [8, 42–44]. In the xSM, it follows

a more significant supercooling. The relation between
the sphaleron energy and the SNR of the corresponding
gravitational wave spectra from the EWPT is shown in
the bottom-right plot, which indicates that the sphaleron
can be probed by the gravitational wave detector (with a
larger SNR) when Λ is lower. The Esph (Tn )/Tn obtained
for all EWPT points are smaller than the SM sphaleron
energy at zero temperature.

by a deviation of the triple and quartic Higgs couplings
in the Higgs potential 7 . Thus the relation between the
sphaleron energy and the phase transition strength studied here makes it possible to probe the sphaleron through
both gravitational wave and collider measurements, in a
complementary role.

Note that the results of a recent numerical simulation by the
same group shows that for strong EWPT (i.e., those with α ∼ 1),
there is a significant deficit in the GW production from the sound
waves [47]. This invalidates the naive generalization of the GW
formulae to arbitrary values of (vw , α). For the xSM, this leads
to a shrinking of the parameter space that gives detectable GWs
while the main features of the resulting parameter space remains
qualitatively unchanged(see [48] for a detailed study). For the
SMEFT, however, it leads to a more severe reduction of the
parameter space, making it difficult to generate detectable GWs.

Probing the (B+L)-violation process is of crucial importance to
test the Sakharov conditions and the EWBG mechanism. Previously, the conventional wisdom is that the (B+L)-violating process at zero temperature is difficult to probe at current and near
future high energy colliders as the sphaleron induced (B+L)violating process is highly rare [9, 49–52]. Very recently, the
Bloch wave approach was proposed such that there is a chance
to observe a (B +L)-violating event at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) [53–57].
The sensitivities of future colliders in the SFOEWPT parameter space (where one can have gravitational wave signal) can be
accessed with the measurements of the two couplings (λhhh and
λhhhh ) at future e+ e− colliders and the HL-LHC [58, 59].
The starting point of the lattice simulation of the sphaleron
rate and EWPT is the dimensional reduction. For the SMEFT
theory with dimensional six operators, the 3d EFT obtained after dimensional reduction is not super-renormalizable, and the
lattice-continuum relations receive corrections at all orders in
