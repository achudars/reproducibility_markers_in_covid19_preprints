Abstract
Skyrmions can be stabilized in magnetic systems with broken inversion symmetry and chiral
interactions, such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI). Further, compensation of magnetic
moments in ferrimagnetic materials can significantly reduce magnetic dipolar interactions, which tend
to favor large skyrmions. Tuning DMI is essential to control skyrmion properties, with symmetry
breaking at interfaces offering the greatest flexibility. However, in contrast to the ferromagnet case, few
studies have investigated interfacial DMI in ferrimagnets. Here we present a systematic study of DMI
in ferrimagnetic CoGd films by Brillouin light scattering. We demonstrate the ability to control DMI by
the CoGd cap layer composition, the stack symmetry and the ferrimagnetic layer thickness. The DMI
thickness dependence confirms its interfacial nature. In addition, magnetic force microscopy reveals the
ability to tune DMI in a range that stabilizes sub-100 nm skyrmions at room temperature in zero field.
Our work opens new paths for controlling interfacial DMI in ferrimagnets to nucleate and manipulate
skyrmions.

Introduction:
Magnetic skyrmions due to their non-trivial topology have interesting properties1-3 that make
them attractive for spintronic applications, such as racetrack memory and logic devices4-6. A
magnetic skyrmion designates a chiral spin texture with a whirling spin configuration7.
Skyrmions can be stabilized by broken inversion symmetry and chiral interactions, such as the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI)8,9, which is an antisymmetric exchange interaction
that favors non-collinear neighboring spins. Ultrathin magnetic materials with interfaces to
heavy non-magnetic metals with large spin-orbit coupling exhibit interfacial DMI that stabilizes
skyrmions and chiral domain walls10-13. The interfacial DMI and the nucleation of skyrmions
have been extensively investigated in ferromagnetic materials10,14-18. Very recently, magnetic
skyrmions and chiral domains were reported in ferrimagnetic systems19-21. Nearly compensated
thin ferrimagnetic films with interfacial DMI are interesting materials due to their low stray
fields, reduced sensitivity to external magnetic fields, and fast spin dynamics, which are
predicted to lead to ultrasmall and ultrafast skyrmions19,22. Unlike in ferromagnets where fast
current-induced motion of chiral textures is impeded by the Walker breakdown and domain
wall pinning13,23-25, high domain wall velocities––reaching 1000 m s-1––have been observed in
ferrimagnetic CoGd films near the angular momentum compensation temperature19. Hence,
ferrimagnetic thin films are promising candidates for ultrafast skyrmion-based spintronics.
Recently, bulk DMI was reported in an amorphous ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloy26. However,
the significant advantages of interfacial DMI are that it can be controlled by the nature of the
interfaces and widely tuned to stabilize skyrmions. Yet, interfacial DMI has not been studied
in this class of materials. The DMI competes with the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and
Heisenberg exchange interaction and tuning the DMI in a range that favors small skyrmions
can be challenging. Asymmetric domain wall nucleation and motion is commonly used to
measure DMI12,27. However, these methods require advanced models of the domain wall
dynamics28,29. A more direct method is Brillouin light scattering (BLS) in the Damon-Eshbach
geometry, which relies on the asymmetric spin-wave frequency dispersion in the presence of
DMI30; the asymmetry is directly related to the strength of the DMI.
Here we present a systematic study of the interfacial DMI in CoGd thin films by BLS as a
function of the capping layer composition and magnetic layer thickness. We aim to understand
how the DMI in CoGd films depends on the structural symmetry and magnetic properties. The
interfaces are studied by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We found
that as little as 10% of W in the cap layer in Pt/CoGd/Pt1-xWx thin films is sufficient to induce
a DMI of about 0.15 mJ m-2, larger than the bulk DMI found in much thicker films26. We also
observed that the DMI is inversely proportional to the magnetic thickness in asymmetric CoGd
stacks, confirming the interfacial nature of the DMI. In addition, we were able to tune the DMI
in a range that stabilizes sub-100 nm skyrmions at room temperature in zero field, as observed
by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Our findings provide insight into the key parameters
that control the DMI in ferrimagnetic films toward achieving ultrasmall and ultrafast skyrmions.

Results:
Tuning the DMI with the capping layer composition:
The ferrimagnetic CoGd thin films were grown by RF magnetron co-sputtering on oxidized
silicon wafers in the following sequence: W(3)/Pt(3)/Co78Gd22(t)/Pt1-xWx(3)/Pt(3) (thicknesses
in nanometers) [Methods]. The W/Pt seed layer provides good adhesion to the substrate and
texture to ensure perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The top Pt layer prevents sample
oxidation. The DMI of a 5-nm thick CoGd film was studied as a function of the W composition
(x) of the cap layer Pt1-xWx. The magnetic properties of the films were measured by vibrating
sample magnetometry (VSM) and are summarized in Table I (Methods). Figures 1(a) and 1(b)
show an out-of-plane field room-temperature magnetization hysteresis loop and the temperature
(T) dependence of the saturation magnetization (MS) for Pt/CoGd(5 nm)/W, respectively. MS
(T) is greatly reduced around 150 K, corresponding to the magnetization compensation
temperature (TM).
Spin wave spectroscopy using BLS was performed to measure the DMI in the CoGd films
(Methods). The DMI leads to an asymmetric frequency dispersion of the counterpropagating
spin waves30. The DMI energy D (mJ m-2) is proportional to the frequency shift (∆f DMI) and
given by:

where g is the spectroscopic splitting factor (we take g = 2), μB the Bohr magneton and h
Planck’s constant and k = 16.7 µm-1 is the spin wave vector. Notably, the DMI energy given by
BLS measurements is an effective DMI averaged over the film thickness, i.e., a sum of the
bottom and top interfacial contributions. An example of BLS spectra is displayed in Fig. 1(c)
for Pt/CoGd(5 nm)/W. We fitted the spectra for positive and negative field polarity. The
frequency shift was determined for the Stokes and the anti-Stokes peaks separately and then
averaged.
The diameter of a skyrmion results from the competition between different energies such as the
Heisenberg exchange energy, the magnetic anisotropy energy and the DMI strength. Ultrasmall
skyrmions can be nucleated at room temperature only in a narrow range of D31-33. For DMI
strength larger than a scale set by the magnetic anisotropy, the formation of stripe domains
become energetically favorable32,33. Conversely, a weak DMI cannot stabilize a skyrmion.
Theoretical work has predicted that ferrimagnetic materials are better candidates than
ferromagnets to host ultrasmall and ultrafast skyrmions due to their low saturation
magnetization, which causes only small stray fields22. Indeed, in ferrimagnetic materials, the
interfacial DMI can dominate over the dipolar interactions and enable the formation of
ultrasmall DMI skyrmions, which is difficult to achieve in ferromagnets. Hence, our goal was
to provide a new method for controlling the interfacial DMI in thin ferrimagnetic CoGd films,
which could allow one to precisely tune the DMI in a range that would enable skyrmion
nucleation.
Changing the nature of the CoGd interfaces can be used to engineer the DMI strength.
Therefore, the idea is to leave the Pt underlayer at the bottom interface of the CoGd film
unchanged and insert a Pt1-xWx alloy at the top interface. Thus, by changing the composition of
the Pt1-xWx alloy, the structural symmetry of the film can be gradually broken to induce DMI.

Pt is chosen for its strong spin-orbit coupling that gives a large interfacial DMI on Co spins34,35.
Theoretical calculations based on Hund’s first rule have shown that, on the contrary, a weaker
DMI arises from interactions between W and Co34 and with the same chirality as Pt and Co. In
addition, W, due to its giant spin-Hall angle36,37, would serve as a spin current source to enable
skyrmion motion induced by spin-orbit torque (SOT).
Figure 2(a) shows the DMI energy as a function of the W composition (x) in Pt/CoGd(5 nm)/Pt1-2
xWx measured by BLS. A maximum DMI of 0.23 ± 0.02 mJ m is obtained for the asymmetric
stack (x = 1). In comparison, a bulk DMI of up to 0.10 mJ m-2 was reported in ferrimagnetic
GdFeCo films26. Conversely, the DMI is almost zero for the symmetric film (x = 0). Indeed, in
the Pt/CoGd/Pt film, the top and bottom interfaces induce an interfacial DMI of similar
amplitude but opposite sign (as the DMI is a chiral interaction), thus, resulting in a near
vanishing effective DMI. In Pt/CoGd/W, since W gives rise to a weaker interfacial DMI, the
contributions of the two interfaces are not compensated, leading to a larger effective DMI. As
seen in Fig. 2(a), as little as 10 % of W introduced in the top layer is enough to significantly
break the symmetry and induce a DMI of 0.15 mJ m-2. Yet, for x > 0.1, the DMI is less sensitive
to the W content in the top interface. This would indicate that for 0.1 < x < 0.9, the W rather
greatly reduces the DMI between the Co spins and the Pt. Indeed, if the W were actively
contributing to the interfacial DMI, a stronger dependence of the DMI energy with the alloy
composition would have been expected. Additionally, the quality of the interfaces, which has a
great impact on the DMI38,39, was assessed by cross-sectional TEM. Figure 2(b) shows a crosssection of the asymmetric Pt/CoGd(5 nm)/W film, while a closer view of the top and bottom
interfaces of the CoGd layer is displayed in Fig. 2(c). The CoGd alloy and the W layers are
amorphous and the Pt is polycrystalline. Figure 2(c) shows that the Pt/CoGd and the CoGd/W
interfaces are smooth.
Thickness-dependence of the DMI:
It is necessary to study the dependence of the DMI on CoGd thickness to establish its nature,
i.e. to know whether the DMI is arising from interfacial effects. In our Pt/Co78Gd22(t)/Pt1-xWx
films, the W composition (x) was fixed either to 0 or 1 to investigate the DMI in a symmetric
(x=0) and asymmetric (x=1) stack as a function of the magnetic thickness t. t was increased
from 5 nm to 15 nm. The magnetic properties were systematically measured by VSM as a
function of thickness. The results are presented in Fig. 3(a) and the DMI is plotted versus the
inverse magnetic thickness. In the asymmetric Pt/CoGd/W stack, the DMI is inversely
proportional to the magnetic thickness and reaches a minimum of 0.09 ± 0.01 mJ m-2 for 1/t =
0.067 nm-1 (t = 15 nm). The DMI linearly increases with the inverse thickness at a rate of ~ 1
mJ nm-1. This confirms that the strength of the DMI at the interface remains unchanged and
underlines its interfacial nature. In Fig. 3(b), the saturation magnetization times the magnetic
thickness is plotted versus the CoGd thickness. It has a linear dependence on thickness with an
x-axis intercept near zero thickness, which indicates that there is no measurable dead layer in
the CoGd film. Notably, in Fig. 3(a), the intercept of the linear fit is non-zero for 1/t = 0 (i.e. an
infinitely thick film). This indicates that there is a residual DMI of 0.03 mJ m-2, which may
result from a change of the magnetization compensation temperature throughout the thickness
as evidenced in another rare-earth transition-metal alloy40 that could induce inversion symmetry
breaking. Yet, as the thickness decreases, the interfacial effects become more important and the
DMI increases as seen in Fig. 3(a). Thus, the interfacial DMI dominates in the entire thickness
range we have studied.

On the other hand, for the symmetric Pt/CoGd/Pt film, the DMI increases with the thickness to
a value of 0.09 ± 0.02 mJ m-2 as seen in Fig. 3(a) (red data points). This behavior is surprising
as the interfacial DMI is expected to be almost zero in symmetric layer structures. This result
shows there is a difference in the nature of the top and bottom CoGd interfaces. In order to
verify the latter, we performed TEM imaging in the Pt/CoGd(15 nm)/Pt film. The full stack is
shown in Fig. 4(a) and a closer view of the top and bottom interfaces in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c),
respectively. In Fig. 4(b), a thin layer of intermediate gray contrast (indicated by the white
arrows) can be seen at the top CoGd interface and not in the bottom interface. It appears that
the Pt from the capping layer has diffused into the amorphous CoGd film. As a result, the
bottom and top interfaces have different roughness and intermixing. Hence, the DMI
contributions of the top and bottom interfaces are not equal. Thus, due to the chirality of the
interaction, they do not cancel out, leading to an increase of the net DMI. Intermixing and
roughness effects appear to be more predominant in thicker films as the DMI increases with
thickness in Pt/CoGd/Pt as seen in Fig. 3(a). Interestingly, the residual DMI observed for the
asymmetric stack is of the same order of magnitude as that for the symmetric Pt/CoGd(5 nm)/Pt
structure. Therefore, this suggests that this residual DMI is independent of the CoGd interfaces.
Finally, as the skyrmion size depends on the magnetic film thickness22,33, it is thus important to
understand how the interfacial DMI scales with the thickness.
Evidence of magnetic skyrmions by MFM:
Finally, we aimed to verify whether these thin ferrimagnetic alloy films would indeed host
skyrmions. We focused on the asymmetric Pt/CoGd/W stacks as they are more promising for
skyrmion motion via spin-orbit torque because of the giant spin-Hall angle of W36,37. In fact, in
Pt/CoGd/Pt, the spin-orbit torques from the top and bottom interfaces would tend to cancel each
other out. The Pt/CoGd/W films were subject to AC in-plane magnetic field demagnetization
and imaged by atomic and magnetic force microscopy (AFM and MFM) at room temperature
in zero field. Figure 5 shows images for Pt/CoGd(10 nm)/W. The left column is AFM data
(Figs. 5(a) and (c)) and right column MFM images (Figs. 5(b) and (d)). The surface roughness
was measured and is on the order of 0.2 nm (rms). Magnetic contrast is indicated by dark areas
in the MFM images. By comparing the AFM and MFM images, it is clear that this contrast
comes from magnetic textures and is not due to topography. Several skyrmion-like textures can
be seen in Fig. 5(b). Figure 5(d) corresponds to a smaller MFM scan performed around of one
of them marked by a square box in Fig. 5(b). This skyrmion-like texture is on the order of 100
nm. 50 nm skyrmions were observed in Pt/CoGd(8 nm)/W (see supplemental materials41).
Arguably, considering the size of these textures, the DMI energy values [see Fig. 3(a)], and the
fact that the CoGd films are weakly magnetized (MS ~ 140 – 150 kA m-1, see supplemental
materials41), it is unlikely that these textures be magnetic bubbles4,7 stabilized by dipolar
interactions. Thus, MFM images would rather indicate the presence of skyrmions. However,
accurate estimation of the skyrmion size is difficult. Indeed, the MFM tip is sensitive to the
dipolar field emerging from the magnetic texture which is spatially spread out. Furthermore,
smaller magnetic features may be present in Fig. 5(b), yet they cannot be clearly distinguished
due to the background noise and small magnetic contrast.
Discussion:
To summarize, we have demonstrated that by capping the ferrimagnetic CoGd layer with a PtW
alloy we could tune the DMI energy over a large range, from almost no DMI to an interfacial
DMI energy of 0.23 mJ m-2. The DMI thickness dependence reveals the interfacial nature of
the DMI in CoGd thin films. Thus, the DMI strength can be controlled by the interfaces in the

thickness range we studied, which is also the range relevant for skyrmion nucleation. Moreover,
the DMI was found to be non-zero in thicker symmetric structures emphasizing the role of
interface roughness and intermixing. Lastly, we showed evidence that films can have a DMI in
a range that allows sub-100 nm skyrmion nucleation at room temperature in zero field. Our
experimental results provide insight into the key parameters that control the DMI in
ferrimagnetic films toward achieving ultrasmall and ultrafast skyrmion motion for spintronic
applications.
Methods:
Thin film deposition:
The thin films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering and deposited onto Si-SiO2 substrates
at room temperature with a base pressure of 2.7´10-5 Pa. The Ar deposition pressures of W, Pt,
CoGd, and Pt1-xWx were 0.93 Pa, 0.1 Pa, 0.16 Pa, and 0.16 Pa, respectively. CoGd films were
obtained by co-sputtering from the Co and Gd targets. The powers of the Co and Gd sources
were tuned to obtain CoGd films with approximately 78 at. % of Co. The deposition rates were
calibrated using x-ray reflectometry.
Magnetometry:
The magnetic properties of the samples were measured by vibrating sample magnetometry.
Magnetic hysteresis loops were measured by varying the temperature from 100 K to 300 K with
steps of 25 K in order to extract the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization
and the coercive field. Magnetometry was systematically performed prior to BLS experiments.
Brillouin light scattering:
Spin wave spectroscopy using BLS is sensitive to interfacial effects and can be used to measure
the DMI strength. The spin waves (SWs) inelastically scatter the monochromatic laser beam
that is focused onto the sample surface. The frequency of the scattered photons is shifted by the
SWs frequency. The SWs frequency is determined by analyzing the backscattered light with a
(3 + 3)-pass tandem Fabry-Pérot interferometer. The counterpropagating Damon-Eshbach SWs
have a non-reciprocal frequency dispersion characterized by a frequency shift (noted ∆fDMI).
The frequency shift is considered here in absolute value. An in-plane bias magnetic field was
applied to allow the SW propagate in-plane (Damon- Eshbach geometry). For a λ = 532 nm
laser beam with an incidence of θi = π/4, the SW vector, k defined as k = 4πsin(θi)/λ was set to
16.7 μm-1.
