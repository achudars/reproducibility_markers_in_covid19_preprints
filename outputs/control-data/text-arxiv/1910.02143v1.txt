ABSTRACT

We present a deep Blanco/DECam colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) for the large
but very diffuse Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxy Crater II. The CMD shows only
old stars with a clearly bifurcated subgiant branch (SGB) that feeds a narrow red
giant branch. The horizontal branch (HB) shows many RR Lyrae and red HB stars.
Comparing the CMD with [Fe/H] = -2.0 and [α/Fe] = +0.3 alpha-enhanced BaSTI
isochrones indicates a mean age of 12.5 Gyr for the main event and a mean age of 10.5
Gyr for the brighter SGB. With such multiple star formation events Crater II shows
similarity to more massive dwarfs that have intermediate age populations, however
for Crater II there was early quenching of the star formation and no intermediate
age or younger stars are present. The spatial distribution of Crater II stars overall
is elliptical in the plane of the sky, the detailed distribution shows a lack of strong
central concentration, and some inhomogeneities. The 10.5 Gyr subgiant and upper
main sequence stars show a slightly higher central concentration when compared to the
12.5 Gyr population. Matching to Gaia DR2 we find the proper motion of Crater II:
µα cos δ=-0.14 ± 0.07 , µδ =-0.10 ± 0.04 mas yr−1 , approximately perpendicular to the
semi-major axis of Crater II. Our results provide constraints on the star formation and
chemical enrichment history of Crater II, but cannot definitively determine whether
or not substantial mass has been lost over its lifetime.

ciated with our Galaxy. It occupies a parameter space where
it is physically very large - with half light radius 1066 ± 84
pc (Torrealba et al. 2016) so similar in size to classic dwarf
galaxies such as Sculptor and Fornax - but 100 times less luminous with Mv = −8.2 (Torrealba et al. 2016), and of such
low stellar density that its stars are difficult to discern from

amongst Galactic foreground stars and faint background
galaxies. In this latter characteristic it is similar to the ultrafaint dwarfs (UFD) and Simon (2019) draws the boundary
between UFDs and more luminous dwarfs in the luminosity
- metallicity plane close to the position of Crater II. The
discovery of Antlia II (Torrealba et al. 2019) lying behind
the Galactic disk and also of similar size and very low surface brightness might argue for a significant number of such
galaxies still to be discovered. It is presently an open question as to how Crater II formed and subsequently evolved,
with a key aspect being whether it has lost most of its original mass and, if not, how has it managed to remain intact
for a Hubble time? Fritz et al. (2018) analysed the orbits of
a number of Milky Way (MW) satellites by use of Gaia Data
Release 2 (Gaia DR2, Gaia Collaboration 2018) proper motion determinations. For Crater II, they find a reconstructed
orbit that is radial with eccentricity ∼ 0.7 and with pericenter that may be less than 20 kpc from the center of the
MW, depending on the adopted mass for the MW. Such an
orbit, consistent with models by Sanders, Evans & Dehnen
(2018); Fattahi et al. (2018), together with the observed size
of Crater II, would suggest a system vulnerable to disruption. In addition, Fu, Simon & Alarcón Jara (2019) identify
37 Crater II members from radial velocities, 22 previously
classified as members by Caldwell et al. (2017), and together
with Gaia DR2 astrometry calculate an orbit for Crater II,
concluding that it is almost certain that the galaxy has been
stripped over its lifetime. Spectroscopy of Crater II members, mostly Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars (Caldwell et al. 2017; Fu, Simon
& Alarcón Jara 2019), demonstrates a resolved but rather
narrow range of [Fe/H] values, suggesting a relatively simple chemical evolution, together with very cold dynamics
although, despite this, apparently Crater II is dark-matter
dominated with M/L = 53+15
M /LV, (Caldwell et al.
−11
2017).
Studies of Crater II by our group and others (Joo et al.
2018; Monelli et al. 2018; Vivas et al. 2019), have identified a
copious number of RR Lyrae (RRL) variable stars indicative
of a strong ancient population. Importantly, RRL are useful
for delineating the spatial distribution of the galaxy, and for
large enough structures can determine the depth as well. In
the case of Crater II, the RRL distribution could provide a
strong observational constraint as to whether stars are still
being lost (Vivas et al. 2019).
In this paper we study the star formation history of
Crater II by analyzing a Colour Magnitude Diagram (CMD)
that reaches well below the main sequence turn-off (MSTO)
for the oldest population. A companion paper (Vivas et al.
2019) discusses the variable star content of Crater II, from
the same set of observations. In § 2 we describe the observations and preparation of the data, in § 3 we discuss the features of the CMD and compare with theoretical isochrones,
in § 4 we discuss the spatial distribution of Crater II stars,
and by matching 80 stars classified as members and with
low Gaia proper motion errors, we calculate the Crater II
proper motion. In § 5 we relate the variable stars properties
to the CMD results, and in § 6 we discuss the results and
present our conclusions.

OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The Crater II observations presented here derive from an
allocation of three nights awarded by NOAO (P.I. A.R.
Walker, prop-id 2017A-0210) with DECam on the Blanco
4m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
(CTIO). From these observations we have produced a deep
CMD and high-quality light curves for the Crater II variable
stars, with main science goals to study the star formation
history and the spatial distribution of the galaxy’s stellar
populations. The observing log of the observations used for
the CMD is summarized in Table 1. When the Moon was
down we took exposures of 180s in a u, g, i sequence, centered on the Crater II position as given by Torrealba et al.
(2016) with small dithers to fill in the CCD gaps. If the
Moon was up only g, i exposures were taken. In photometric
conditions SDSS standard star fields were observed, mostly
equatorial.

2.1

Image Combination

The images were processed by the DECam Community
Pipeline (CP, Valdes 2014), which removes the instrument
signature and provides various data products. For the specific purposes of this study custom stacks were produced, as
follows: A total of 153 g, 153 i and 32 u band exposures were
available, and after examination of the image quality and the
depth of each of these exposures, stacks were produced containing 100, 100, 31 selected images in g, i, u respectively,
rejecting images that were taken in poor sky transparency,
or with a very bright sky, or in poor seeing conditions. For
these stacks, the CP produces multi-extension FITS (MEF)
files that have 9 image extensions with each containing approximately 9K × 9K pixels and corresponding to ∼ 39 × 39
arcmin on the sky. The extensions are spatially arranged in
a 3 × 3 format that covers the approximately circular 2 degree diameter DECam field, thus the four corner extensions
(numbers 1, 3, 7, 9) are only partially filled by DECam.
Two alternative algorithms for flattening the sky background are offered by the CP. Here we chose to use the osj
option rather than osi after visual inspection that the former
skies were flatter with only minimal over-subtraction around
very bright objects. The bad pixel masks provided for stacks
are very simple, with a value 0 corresponding to good data,
a value 1 coming from an input image bad pixel mask, and a
value 2 (the majority of the bad pixels) coming from where
there was no useful data, e.g. from a star saturated on all
images. Of particular utility is the exposure map provided
by the CP, that is, an image where the data are the exposure times corresponding to each pixel in the stacked object
image.
We further processed the provided stacks in preparation

for photometry, producing two sets of images as follows: the
first full set had (i) any pixel appearing with a value of 1 or
2 in the bad pixel mask was replaced by 32767, the second
uniform set had (i) any pixel appearing with a value of 1 or
2 in the bad pixel mask was replaced by 32767, in addition
(ii) for all pixels in the exposure maps with value less than
16200 seconds (g, i) or 5040 seconds (u) the corresponding
image pixel was replaced by 32767. The values of 16200 and
5040 seconds are 90% of the maximum possible exposure
times for g, i and u respectively. The value of 32767 for the
invalid pixel indicator was chosen for compatibility with the
requirements of the photometry program (see below).
The observation scripts used for the Crater II exposures deliberately dithered the telescope just enough to fill
in the gaps between the CCDs, with small additional random dithers of size a few arcsec arising from errors in the
telescope pointing and adjustments made by the active optics system on an image by image basis to optimize image
quality. The full data set will therefore contain stars, at a
given magnitude, that have a range in S/N due to a varying
contribution of exposures. However for brighter stars (e.g.
including the RRL at g ∼ 21) high S/N is achieved even with
only a few contributing exposures, and the photometric accuracy is dominated by systematic effects rather than shot
noise. Therefore, for bright stars we have full spatial coverage with no drawbacks, and we can with confidence use
the full dataset (74541 stars) for studying the morphology
of Crater II as indicated by the RRL (Vivas et al. 2019).
For the uniform set as described above with selection by
exposure time, the sacrifice is that the coverage fraction is
reduced to ∼ 60 percent (44294 stars) however the remaining
good pixels are very uniform in depth. This is very important
for correct interpretation of any changes in features in the
faintest parts of the CMD as a function of spatial position.
In summary, from the above procedures we have produced two sets of three image FITS files, one each for g, i
and u, each file with 9 image extensions of approximately 9K
× 9K pixels. The first set covers the full field with no gaps,
and the second set is more restrictive, including ∼ 60 percent
of the stars, but with uniformity and cleanness suitable for
interpreting the photometry to the faintest levels.
2.2

Photometry

We use DAOPHOT (Stetson 1987, 1994) for the photometry.
Firstly, the DAOPHOT parameter files were prepared, of particular note is that we set the highest good pixel value (hi) =
15000 counts. While this is much less that the full-well values for any of the DECam CCDs, the CP does not explicitly
correct for the brighter-fatter effect (Bernstein, et al. 2017)
so it is preferable to keep stars selected to define the PSF and
also those used for comparison with photometric standards
to be those of no more than medium brightness. In any case,
the brighter stars will all be Galactic foreground field stars
and not of interest to this project. We searched for objects
down to S/N threshold (th) of 3.5, in two passes. For the center 9K × 9K field (extension 5, centered on Crater II), and
considering the uniform sample that excludes the dithered
regions, we found 42890, 60368, 1574 objects in g, i, u respectively thus the object density for g, i is approximately
one per 90 arcsec2 , i.e. comfortably low.

lar images and a Moffat function with beta parameter =
3.5 is an excellent fit to the stellar image profiles, including
the profile wings. After some experimentation we chose a
linear-varying (va = 1) PSF as being appropriate; while a
quadratic-varying (va = 2) PSF showed slightly smaller fit
residuals for the PSF stars, the resulting photometry showed
no improvement and we decided to keep the simpler functional form for the PSF. In itself, the ability to fit the stacks
with a va=1 psf form is a simple confirmation that nothing untoward with regard to the star images is taking place
spatially in the stacking process.
Following aperture photometry and PSF star picking,
the PSF photometry was performed in the standard way
with ALLSTAR. For each image the PSF was constructed from
∼ 200 stars (100 for u). The photometric errors for the g − i
colors were calculated as the quadrature sum of the errors
in g and i returned by ALLSTAR, and were <0.01 mag for
g < 21, < 0.02 mag for g < 22.5, and averaged 0.04, 0.1, 0.2
mag at g = 24, 25, 26 respectively. Since the depths achieved
in g and i are similar, the errors in the g and i bands at
these stated magnitudes will be approximately 2/3 of those
for the colors. Exactly the same procedure was carried out
on the two sets of images (uniform, full).
It is instructive to compare the approach chosen here
(stack the images, then run DAOPHOT/ALLSTAR), to the alternative of running DAOPHOT/ALLSTAR/ALLFRAME on the individual images. In principle the latter forced-photometry
approach should be superior (Stetson 1994) and be able to
go deeper since the star list is constructed from all available images. However the computation resources needed to
handle 231 DECam images as opposed to 3 is very significant, and was beyond those available to our group, even
when using PHOTRED1 (Nidever et al. 2017) to handle all the
book-keeping and efficiently automate the process. By contrast, all the photometry for this project was run in a few
minutes per image using a MacBook Pro laptop. The wellknown difficulties for doing photometry on stacks, such as
poor control of PSF across the field, poor control of errors,
varying depth, are mitigated here by the low distortion and
near-constant image quality across the DECam focal plane,
by the similariry of the quantum efficiency response for the
DECam CCDs over the passbands of main interest (g, i),
and by use of the uniform set of reductions as described
above for the critical interpretive tasks.
The photometric (g, i) calibration involved transformation to the SDSS system (Alam et al. 2015; Nidever et al.
2017) by cross-correlating low-error matches (σ < 0.05 mag)
at the catalogue level with the Crater II catalogue produced
by PHOTRED (Nidever et al. 2017), see Vivas et al. (2019) for
details on how the reference catalogue was produced. The
SDSS and DECam g and i passbands are quite similar, and
we find simple linear transformations, excluding stars with
photometric errors σ > 0.05 mag., and using S and D to
denote SDSS and DECam respectively:
gS − gD = 0.0710(±0.0003)(gS −iS )+0.0174(±0.0004), N = 7141

The u band photometry was left on the DECam natural
system, since our intent was to use these observations to
select Crater II members –mostly RGB, AGB and Horizontal
Branch (HB) stars– in g vs. g − i vs. u − g space (Di Cecco
et al. 2015). For this task it is not necessary to calibrate the
u band.
With the photometry in hand, we proceeded with an
initial evaluation by constructing plots of the photometric
errors as a function of magnitude, and plots of the PSF fit
parameters chi and sharp as functions of magnitude. The
former allowed formation of an envelope that included the
great majority of detected objects but excluded those with
large errors, and bounds on chi of 0, 1 fulfilled a similar function of removing errant measurements. Because of the high
Galactic latitude of Crater II and the diffuse nature of the
galaxy itself the star density is not so great as to make photometry difficult by having many overlapping stars, and thus
the sharp parameter is a very efficient separator of stars and
galaxies. We used −0.5 < shar p < 0.2 to select stars and
shar p > 0.2 to select galaxies. The samples appear to be
very pure (referring here to g and i, the shallower u band
images contain few galaxies) except in the final faintest one
magnitude, where from the CMDs (see below) some stars are
clearly classified as galaxies, and vice versa. With these definitions in hand, we proceeded to match stars between the
photometric bands, taking account of the systematic fewpixel positional differences between the g, i, u stacks, defining a successful match for objects with centers separated by
no more than 3.5 pixels (0.9 arcsec). In the case of multiple
matches, the closest was selected. With astrometry from the
original images WCS and redefined using SAOImageDS9, the
nine photometry files were merged into a single stellar photometric catalogue. By comparison, the galaxy photometric
catalogue (i.e. that containing all objects with shar p > 0.2)
contains approximately four times as many objects as the
stellar catalogue. The stellar catalogue is shown in Table 2,
where we use flags to denote whether the object is in the
uniform selection (Funi = 1), is a variable star (Fvar = 1), or
is identified as a probable member on spectroscopic (Fspec
= 1) or photometric grounds (Fphot = 1).

Reddening Correction

We first correct the Crater II photometry for foreground
reddening, obtaining E(B-V) from the Schlegel, Finkbeiner
& Davis (1998) interstellar dust maps using the python task
dustmaps (Green 2018). Although the reddening is small due
to the high Galactic latitude, the very large field of DECam
usually means that the reddening varies across the field, and
so this aspect should be taken into account (see Figure 1).
In order to apply the reddening correction, we correct each g
and i magnitude of our detected sources using the Schlegel,
Finkbeiner & Davis (1998) reddening values and the coefficients given in Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011), i.e. Ag = 3.303

The reddening-corrected i, g −i CMDs are shown in Figure 3, where results for both the full and uniform reductions
are displayed, each of the two sets of three panels depict stars
within a elliptical distance2 of 0.35 degrees of the center of
Crater II, between 0.35 and 0.65 degrees, and exterior to 0.65
degrees. We denote these inner, central, and outer regions,
respectively.

3.2

CMD Description

The CMD (Figure 3) reaches to g, i ∼ 25.5 and the stellar sequences belonging to Crater II are thus defined to well below
the level of the oldest MSTO. Crater II stars are prominent
in the inner and central regions, while the outer region is
dominated by field stars. In the outer region of the DECam field, compact and relatively blue galaxies dominate
in numbers over both field and Crater II stars for magnitudes fainter than i ∼ 24.5. With low S/N some galaxies will
have measured value of DAOPHOT shar p < 0.2 and will thus
be classified as stars, and given the relative numbers, will
appear on the CMD. It is notable that this contamination is
less prominent in the uniform sample than for the full sample, as expected since the uniform sample will exclude stars
with low S/N for a given magnitude. Over the whole field,
compact galaxies outnumber stars by a factor three, but as
previously discussed a cut on DAOPHOT sharp excludes these
with high efficiency except near the faint magnitude cutoff.
Crater II shows a strongly populated HB in the vicinity
of the RRL, the latter are relatively easy to see on the CMD
since they are bluer than the majority of field stars. There
are red HB (RHB) stars, much more contaminated by MSTO
field stars than the RRL. There is a likely increase in density
of the RHB stars of stars near the red end of the RHB.
There appear to be no blue HB (BHB) stars at all, and
this is consistent with the RRL distribution, see discussion

2

We use the elliptical geometry for Crater II as determined from
the RRL (Vivas et al. 2019) so the elliptical distance stated is
half of the geometrical constant of the ellipse at the position of
each star. We denote this by using the nomenclature r’.

*Funi , Fphot , Fspec , and Fvar are flags that show if a particular star has been identified in the uniform catalogue, as photometric member,
as spectroscopically-confirmed star, and as variable star member, respectively.

and content.

in Vivas et al. (2019). The RGB is narrow, down to the
base, however the subgiant branch (SGB) is clearly split into
two components, both feeding into the RGB. There is an
indication that the brighter SGB is less prominent at larger
radii, this will be discussed in the following section. There
are many blue stragglers, but no turn-off brighter than the
two just described is visible.
The Crater II AGB stars and RGB stars brighter than
the HB are difficult to discern from amongst the foreground
field stars, even in the inner regions. However there are three
ways in principle that we can identify Crater II stars in the
field-star dominated regions of the CMD.
Firstly, we can cross reference our photometry to stars
classified as members by Caldwell et al. (2017); Fu, Simon
& Alarcón Jara (2019) on the basis of radial velocity and
metallicity; we call this the spectroscopic membership sample. There are a total of 70 stars in this sample, 56 of them
are in Caldwell et al. (2017) and 35 in Fu, Simon & Alarcón
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

Jara (2019), with 21 stars in common between both catalogues. It is worth noting that, by definition, this is a very
pure sample.
Secondly, we have u band photometry for all stars to
below the level of the HB, and so can select for stars that
are metal-poor in the two-colour diagram, and also lie close
to the cluster sequences in the CMD. In order to separate
candidates and field stars, we followed the prescription described by Di Cecco et al. (2015) and Calamida et al. (2017).
Briefly, we generated two isodensity maps in the i, u − g and
in the g, u − g CMDs and created two ridge lines that helped
us to locate our most probable candidates. These candidates
were selected considering those stars located between ±1σ
(defined as the quadratic sum of the photometric errors in
the three bands) to the 3D ridge line and their position in the
(u − g), (g −i) diagram. We selected a total of 1166 stars that
we call the photometric catalogue. This method is expected
to work well for AGB and RGB stars because the magnitude

Figure 2. Left.- (uinst , g − i) colour-magnitude diagram of the sources contained within the DECam FoV centered on Crater II. Field
stars are shown in grey, photometric members in blue (AGB+RGB) and in green (HB), spectroscopically confirmed members as red
crosses and spectroscopically confirmed non-members in yellow. Cyan open squares display those stars that were classified in this work
as photometric members of Crater II but they are not members from the spectroscopy. A 12.5 Gyr isochrone of [Fe/H] = -2.0 dex is
plotted for guidance. Right.- Colour-colour diagram for the same sources. The spectroscopically confirmed non-members are located in
the region of the more metal-rich stars, while the members of Crater II are in the region of the most metal-poor stars.

of these stars in the g and i bands is a strong function of
the colour, and thus provides an effective constraint. We can
select HB stars similarly, although the small range in luminosity makes field star discrimination less effective. Figure 2
shows, in the left panel, the (uinst , g − i) CMD and, in the
right panel, the (uinst − g) versus (g − i) colour-colour diagram for the selected photometric membership sample with
blue (RGB+AGB) and green (HB) dots while red crosses
represent the spectroscopic membership sample.
We can test for field star contamination in the RGB and
AGB photometric catalogue (863 stars) in the following way:
Caldwell et al. (2017) in their table 2 list all their observed
stars, and have provided probabilities (private communication to M. Monelli) that each star is a Crater II member.
All except a very few stars are classified as member (probability 1) or non-member (probability 0), see Caldwell et
al. (2017) for details of how they calculate the probability.
There are 314 stars with probability 0, represented as yellow
dots in Figure 2. We cut off our photometric catalogue at
i = 20.1 to match the spectroscopic catalogue, leaving 157
stars, and search for positional matches; we find five (cyan
open squares in Figure 2) stars with positional agreements
0.2-0.3 arcsec using a 5 arcsec window. With the areas of the
two catalogues differing by a factor 2.0, then the contamination in our catalogue of RGB and AGB stars is thus 5 × 2 /
157 = 0.06. This analysis does assume that the fainter stars
in our photometric catalogue have the same degree of field
star contamination as do those brighter than i = 20.1 but
this is a reasonable assumption, see Figure 2. We note that
one of the five stars is metal poor, [Fe/H] = -1.67 and with
a radial velocity indicating a non-member, is apparently a
halo giant at approximately the distance of Crater II. The
remaining four stars are non members on the grounds of
both metallicity and radial velocity.
The photometric sample also contains 303 RHB stars.
Unfortunately, we have no way of testing spectroscopically
for membership in any significant way, with only two RHB

stars in the Fu, Simon & Alarcón Jara (2019) catalogue.
Membership can be evaluated by counting field stars in photometric (magnitude, colour) boxes above and below the
RHB. This is complicated by the high density of field stars,
and the rapid change of star density as a function of colour
as the MSTO colour for the foreground stars is approached.
We conclude that the photometric catalogue for the RGB
and AGB stars is pure at the 95% level, but the RHB star
entries (303 stars) will be contaminated by field stars at a
much higher level, and one that is difficult to estimate.
Thirdly, we have the variable star members. In our companion paper (Vivas et al. 2019), we have identified a total
of 106 variable star members of Crater II which consist of
983 RRL, seven Anomalous Cepheid (AC), and one dwarf
Cepheid (DC) stars. This sample is also considered a very
pure.

Isochrone Comparison to the CMD

The BaSTI4 (Hidalgo et al. 2018) model grid selected for
the present analysis corresponds to that of stellar evolutionary computations accounting for the occurrence of mass loss
(according to the Reimers’ law and the free parameter η
set to the value of 0.3) as well as for core convective overshooting during the central H-burning stage and atomic diffusion. However core convective overshooting is irrelevant in
the present context since low-mass (i.e. old) stars burn H
into a radiative core. In Figure 4 we compare the CMD sequences with alpha-enhanced (Pietrinferni et al. in prep.)
BaSTI isochrones and zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB)
models.

Figure 3. Colour-Magnitude diagrams of Crater II. Top and bottom panels represent the full and the uniform catalogues, respectively
(see the text for details). Left panels show those stars within 0.35◦ elliptical distance (see text for details) centred on Crater II, middle
panels display those stars within 0.35◦ and 0.65◦ , while right panels show those stars beyond 0.65◦ .

& Alarcón Jara (2019) finds mean [Fe/H] = -2.0 with a small
dispersion (sigma ∼ 0.2 ± 0.1 dex). With Crater II lying near
the boundary between UFDs and classical dwarfs (Simon
2019), we assume that Crater II will behave similarly with
respect to alpha element enhancement. All these galaxies,
at the metallicity of Crater II or lower, are alpha-enhanced
(Kirby, et al. 2011; Vargas, et al. 2013; Simon 2019) with
the transition from high alpha to solar alpha ratio driven by
the change from dominance of SN II to SN Ia, and showing
variance from galaxy to galaxy depending on the details of
the star formation history for each. For Crater II a choice of
[α/Fe] = +0.3 would seem appropriate. We therefore choose
BaSTI-IAC alpha-enhanced isochrones (Pietrinferni et al.
in preparation) with [Fe/H] = -2.0 and [α/Fe] = +0.3, after exploring parameter space quite widely. In matching the
isochrones and the ZAHB to the data we use the most reMNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

cent RRL distance modulus (µ0 = 20.333 ± 0.004 mag, Vivas
et al. 2019), and apply a small colour shift of 0.04 magnitude so that the isochrones better coincide with the observational sequences. The origin of this colour shift could be
one or more of small errors in the reddening scale, errors
in the photometric zeropoints, or a residual shortcoming in
the adopted colour-effective temperature scale adopted for
transferring the isochrones from the theoretical plane to the
observational one.
The right panel of Figure 4 shows that the photometric (dark blue dots) and spectroscopic (black open squares)
members of Crater II play an important role when doing
the isochrone matching. The age of the isochrone that best
matches the older turnoff is 12.5 Gyr and the younger SGB
is best matched with an isochrone with the same metallicity
and an age of 10.5 Gyr. The latter is a minority population,

Figure 4. Isochrone Comparison to the CMD of Crater II (r’ < 0.78◦ , 1.5×rh ). The CMD was corrected star-by-star by the Schlegel,
Finkbeiner & Davis (1998) reddening map, using the modified version of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011). Orange and light blue lines
represent the best set of [Fe/H]=-2.0 alpha enhanced ([α/Fe]=+0.3) isochrones from BaSTI (Pietrinferni et al. in preparation) that
match the CMD of Crater II, 12.5 Gyr and 10.5 Gyr respectively. Isochrones and ZAHB were shifted using a distance modulus for
Crater II of 20.33 mag (Vivas et al. 2019). Additionally, we add 0.04 mag to the total reddening in order to make the isochrones and the
stellar sequences match better (see text for more details). Spectroscopic members are shown as black squares in the right panel, while
photometric members are displayed as dark blue dots and variable members (RR Lyrae stars, Anomalous Cepheids, dwarf Cepheid) are
purple dots.

and given the errors in the individual spectroscopic measurements for the stars classed as Crater II members, we
cannot rule out that the 10.5 Gyr stars might have slightly
lower alpha elements abundance and slightly higher [Fe/H]
than does the 12.5 Gyr population, a scenario similar to that
convincingly demonstrated for the Carina dwarf galaxy by
VandenBerg, Stetson & Brown (2015). If, for example, we
compare a solar-scaled isochrone with [Fe/H] = -1.7 (Hidalgo et al. 2018) to the younger population then an excellent match is obtained, although at an age 1 Gyr younger
(9.5 Gyr) than the alpha enhanced isochrone.
Similarly, while there is no obvious evidence for older
(12.5 - 13.5 Gyr) stars, the lack of sensitivity of the RGB
colour to metallicity for metal poor stars, the age-metallicity
degeneracy, and the unknown alpha element enhancement
for such stars, make it possible to hide such a minority population. We return to this issue in § 6.
Note that the isochrones are placed on the centre of the
star distributions in the CMD; compared to the magnitude
errors at the level of the SGBs both appear to be broadened
in age. The younger population is close to, or under, the age
limit of 10-11 Gyr for forming RRL (Walker 1989; Glatt et
al. 2008; Catelan 2018), and is thus expected to contain few

or no RRL, with the majority of the core-helium burning
stars populating the RHB.

3.4

The Horizontal Branch Morphology

We consider an inner region with r’ < 35 arcmin (see § 4.2)
within which we count 0 BHB, 43 RRL and 80 RHB stars,
and (see Table 3) 530 stars from the older SGB and 233
from the younger. The older SGB will populate the RHB
and RRL, while the younger SGB will likely only populate
the RHB, if so we calculate that 43 RRL and 42 RHB stars
belong to the 12.5 Gyr population and 38 RHB stars belong
to the 10.5 Gyr population. We calculate the HB morphology parameter (Lee 1990) for the 12.5 Gyr population to be
N(BHB)−N(RHB)
= −0.49.
N(BHB)+N(RRL)+N(RHB)
As demonstrated by Lee et al. (1994) and Sarajedini,
Lee & Lee (1995) for Galactic globular clusters, a HB dominated by RRL and RHB stars with few or no BHB stars
can be produced by high metal abundance, clearly not the
case here, but also by young age. For a metal poor population such as Crater II, an age of the RRL of 11-12 Gyr after
applying a small zeropoint offset, accounting for the modern
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)

The Colour Magnitude Diagram of Crater II
age of the Universe (13.8 Gyr), to the results of Lee et al.
(1994) and Sarajedini, Lee & Lee (1995), is consistent with
the observed HB morphology, but suggesting an age slightly
younger than found by our isochrone fitting.
Other parameters that can affect the HB morphology are He abundance enhancements or spread, or a noncanonical value for the mass loss on the RGB. After the
discovery of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters
there is compelling evidence (Milone, et al. 2014) that, after
metallicity and age, He abundance anomalies play a major
role in determining HB morphology. However for Crater II
such anomalies would produce BHB stars, which are not observed. For mass loss, McDonald & Zijlstra (2015) show for
a large sample of globular clusters that there is little dispersion in the measurements. We will proceed for Crater II by
making the assumption that age and metallicity are driving the HB morphology, as there is no evidence from the
available data that more exotic explanations are required.
3.5

The CMD and the RR Lyrae Variables

Joo et al. (2018); Monelli et al. (2018); Vivas et al. (2019)
show that the Crater II RRL period distribution is unusual
with only a few RRcd stars and many RRab. This distribution implies that a 12.5 Gyr stellar population, during the
core He-burning stage, is not able to populate the whole
RR Lyrae domain from the blue edge of the First Overtone instability strip to the red boundary of the Fundamental strip. In this respect Crater II is similar to the unusual Galactic globular cluster Ruprecht 106 (Dotter et al.
2018), which is young, metal-poor and contains only RRab
variables (Buonanno, Corsi, Pecci, Richer & Fahlman 1993;
Kaluzny, Krzeminski & Mazur 1995; Leaman, VandenBerg
& Mendel 2013).
By considering the dispersion in brightness in the iband RRL period-luminosity (PL) relation, and dividing the
RRab stars into bright (B) and faint (F) groups by considering the position of each star relative to the mean PL relation, Vivas et al. (2019) show that the two groups have
a different spatial distribution with the F group more centrally concentrated (their figure 12). This is interpreted as a
small difference in the mean metallicity (nominally 0.17 dex)
between the two groups. We do note, considering the spectroscopic sample of stars and removing the AGB stars, the
RGB stars are almost all closer than 0.02 mag in colour to
the fitted isochrone (Figure 4). The BaSTI isochrones show
that a small systematic metallicity shift of 0.1-0.2 dex could
be hidden in the present observations particularly if combined with a slight age change (e.g. a few 100 Myr) given
the well-known degeneracy between RGB age and metallicity, in the sense that younger age will produce a bluer RGB
and higher metallicity will make the RGB redder.
Additionally, we plotted a Cugi diagram (Monelli, et
al. 2013) for the Crater II RGB stars with spectroscopy,
this pseudo-colour can split stars with different metalliicities over much of the RGB. We divided the stars into two
groups divided by [Fe/H] = -2.0, and found no significant
difference between the location of the two groups of stars in
this diagram. We conclude that we are not able, with the
photometry alone, to provide further insight into the possible metallicity gradients in Crater II suggested by Vivas et
al. (2019).

CRATER II STRUCTURE AND MOTION
Proper Motion

All proper motion measurements are from Gaia DR2 (Gaia
Collaboration 2018). Figure 5 has three panels, the left panel
shows the 2D proper motion distribution for stars in an external field comprising an annulus with radii of 1.5 and 2.0
deg centered on Crater II, the center panel shows the 2D
proper motions distribution for stars inside r < 1.0 deg, and
the right panel is the subtraction between the first two panels (normalized) that clearly reveals Crater II. Guided by
this, we proceed by selecting stars in our catalogue that satisfy the following criteria: they are flagged as photometric,
spectroscopic, or variable star members; they are found in
Gaia DR2 with proper motion errors smaller than 1 mas
yr−1 ; and they have proper motions between ±3 mas yr−1
mas yr−1 (both in RA and Dec). This gives a sample of 80
stars, which are displayed as orange symbols in Figure 6, of
which 50 have spectroscopy and thus also appear in proper
motion analyses by Fritz et al. (2018); Fu, Simon & Alarcón
Jara (2019), 65 are photometric members (of which 36 have
spectroscopy), and 1 AC. The proper motion of Crater II
is then determined by a weighted average of the proper motions for these 80 stars, in units of mas yr−1 , µα cos δ = −0.14
± 0.07 (standard deviation = 0.66), µδ = −0.10 ±0.04 (standard deviation = 0.38), represented by a blue square in Figure 6. This Crater II systemic proper motion, using a slightly

The Spatial Distribution of Crater II stars

The GB stars (RGB + AGB) of Crater II overall have an
elliptical distribution similar to that found for the RRL by
Vivas et al. (2019), the parameters of which we have adopted
for the analysis in this section. In Figure 7 we show the
distribution and the morphology for the 863 GB stars from
the photometric sample together with the proper motion
vector obtained in § 4.1.
The distribution of the members of Crater II (see § 3.2)
does not show a peaked central concentration, also suggested
from the distribution of RRL (Vivas et al. 2019) and confirmed by the larger sample of stars here. Although overall the distribution of stars is smooth, on closer examination there are indications of inhomogeneities in the spatial
distribution of stars. Figure 8, an isodensity contour map,
shows two overdensities located at (RA = 177.45 deg, DEC
= -18.47 deg) and (RA = 177.18 deg, DEC = -18.40 deg).
They are approximately the same distance from the Crater II
center (displayed as a black cross), and between these two
peaks, in the center of Crater II, there is a 2-σ fall in the
number of stars. The reliability of these overdensities is statistically confirmed by calculation of Poisson uncertainties.
There is an indication from Figure 3 that there may be
a difference in the relative numbers of the two SGB populations as a function of the elliptical distance (r’), and we
investigate this further by selecting stars from the SGB and

the top of the MS region of the CMD (from i = 22.8 to i =
24.3). We follow up the 10.5 Gyr isochrone with a circular
bin of radius 0.02 mag, and with a circular bin of radius 0.03
mag for the 12.5 Gyr isochrones. At the ends of the region
under consideration the two tracks are close enough so the
stars may appear in both selections, in such cases the closest isochrone is selected so that there is no double counting.
The selection performed is shown in Figure 9.
We then use the center of Crater II and the elliptical
shape as defined by the RRL (Vivas et al. 2019) and divide
into three annuli, the inner contains stars with elliptical distance (r’) less than 0.35 degrees, the second with elliptical
distances between 0.35 and 0.65 degrees, and the outer with
elliptical distances between 0.70 and 0.78 degrees. Although
there are Crater II stars across the whole DECam field, their
numbers in this outer annulus will be very few compared to
the field stars, and for the MSTO region a good approximation for the purposes of this calculation is zero Crater II
stars, however we conservatively consider an error of 10 per-

number to correct the inner and center annulus star counts
for field star contamination. For stars definitely identified
as Crater II members such as the RRL, no corrections are
required for comparing their star counts in the two inner
annuli, and the errors quoted derive from the counts only.
The results in Table 3 highlight the difference between
the central concentration of faint and bright RRL, shown
as a radial plot in figure 12 of Vivas et al. (2019). This has
been interpreted as a slightly more metal poor population

having a wider spatial distribution than the more metal rich
stars. In any case, the spread in metallicity between the two
populations is expected to be small. In addition, we confirm by star counts the visual impression that the SGB plus
upper MS stars that follow the 10.5 Gyr isochrone appear
slightly more centrally concentrated than those that follow
the 12.5 Gyr isochrone. For more populous dwarf galaxies
it is commonly found that younger populations are more
centrally condensed than older populations (see e.g. Harbeck, et al. 2001; Tolstoy, et al. 2004; Okamoto, et al. 2017),
although generally the age differences are greater than for
Crater II. While it is suggestive here to make an association
between the two populations of SG-MSTO stars and the apparent two groups of RRL stars, a direct association is not
supported on stellar evolution grounds as discussed above,
and the ratios in Table 3 have large error bars. However,
the radial distributions of the RRL and the two SG-MSTO
stars are not inconsistent, in a scenario of a small increase of
metallicity over a rather narrow age range. Spectroscopy of
the HB stars, possible with present large telescopes, would
help to turn the tentative statements from the present data
into firmer conclusions.

CRATER II VARIABLE STARS
PROGENITORS

The RRL variables are discussed by Joo et al. (2018); Monelli et al. (2018); Vivas et al. (2019), with the latter paper
providing a definitive analysis of the pulsational properties.
The distribution and relation of the RRL to other CMD
components are discussed above. In addition to the 99 RRL
(98 measured from DECam data), seven ACs and one DC
have been found in Crater II by Vivas et al. (2019). With the
large numbers of blue stragglers (BS) and no young stars,
the DC is interpreted as an SX Phoenicis variable, and its
discovery amongst the BS stars is not surprising, indeed
there are likely to be more of these (very faint and short
period) stars waiting discovery. For the AC, there are two
production channels (Bono, Caputo, Santolamazza, Cassisi
& Piersimoni 1997; Fiorentino & Monelli 2012; Cassisi &
Salaris 2013), the first is from an intermediate age population that directly produces the 1 − 2 M stars, and for
which there is no progenitor evidence from the Crater II
CMD, while the second channel is from BS stars. This route
also has two possible production channels, both involving

merging of two stars; in globular clusters stellar collisions in
the dense cluster core will be frequent, however this route is
clearly not significant for Crater II. Instead, the coalescence
of close binaries will be the production channel relevant here
(Gautschy & Saio 2017).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

From analysis of a deep CMD, and by comparison with the
properties of the RRL discussed in detail in a companion paper (Vivas et al. 2019) we can make a number of statements
about this unusual, but perhaps not uncommon, galaxy.
The main new finding in this paper has been possible
thanks to the unprecedentedly deep CMD, which reaches the
old MSTO with high photometric precision. The stellar populations of Crater II are characterized by two main events of
star formation that occurred at a mean age of 12.5 and 10.5
Gyr ago. An old (∼ 13.5 Gyr) population seems to be a minor component, as disclosed by the main sequence isochrone
fitting, by the HB morphology, which lacks a blue component, and by the characteristics of the RRL variable star
population. These characteristics of the stellar population of
Crater II (MV = -8.2) are very unusual among UFDs; a similarly extended period of star formation in a UFD has been
found so far only in the M31 satellite And XVI (Monelli,
et al. 2016; MV = −7.3), even though in that case a double
star-formation episode is not evident in the CMD, while it is
hinted in the star formation history derived through CMD
fitting. What may be the origin of a stellar component with
such unusual characteristics? To try to answer this question,
we will consider other observed aspects of this galaxy.
Firstly, the Crater II proper motion confirmed here, and
the orbit that has been derived (Fritz et al. 2018; Fu, Simon
& Alarcón Jara 2019) suggest strongly that Crater II should
be disrupting due to penetrating well into the more central
regions of our Galaxy on each orbit. From the current analysis, we can state, in contrast, that the galaxy structure seems
regular, and the younger (10.5 Gyr) population is more centrally concentrated than the older (12.5 Gyr) population,
as is common in dwarf galaxies (Harbeck, et al. 2001; Tolstoy, et al. 2004; Okamoto, et al. 2017), which would support
a quiet rather than an episodically violent life. However, we
cannot make strong direct statements about this scenario, as
a much wider area survey for extra tidal material, in particular RRL, would be needed to provide observational proof.
In this scenario, a relatively minor old population could
be explained by preferential tidal stripping in the earliest
pericentric passages (see e.g. Fritz et al. 2018 for an orbit
integration under different assumptions of the Milky Way
potential). The second event of star formation could have
occurred or even have been triggered by one of these early
pericentric passages, before complete removal of gas would
have taken place, while the prior star formation events are
consistent with star formation occurring along the orbit of
the galaxy. This is behavior that is expected from simulations (see, e.g. Nichols, Revaz & Jablonka 2015 or Hausammann, Revaz & Jablonka 2019) and that has been observed,
for example, in the Sagittarius dSph, which has retained gas
and continued star formation during several pericentric passages prior to infalling (Siegel, et al. 2007).
An alternative scenario would be that Crater II is a rel-

atively recent capture by our Galaxy; a relatively low initial
star formation rate could indicate that it formed in an environment isolated from other galaxies. Gallart et al. (2015)
suggested that the difference between dwarf galaxies with
fast evolution (in fast dwarfs, star formation would have
started early, probably before reionization and would have
terminated early) compared to slow evolution (low intensity
of early star formation, which then takes place for most or
all of a Hubble time) depended on the density of the environment at time of formation, with fast evolvers forming in
high density environments.
If the low amount of old population in Crater II is intrinsic (that is, not due to preferential stripping of the old
population), it implies that the rate of star formation was
low prior to reionization, and by this Crater II would comply
with one of the criteria to be classified as a slow dwarf. However, the relatively early cessation of star formation ∼10 Gyr
ago is at odds with the normal definition of a slow dwarf.
A combination of the two scenarios is however plausible. Given the high eccentricity of the derived orbit, and the
expected orbital changes along the evolution in live haloes
(Nichols, Revaz & Jablonka 2015), the early distance of
Crater II to the Milky Way may have been in excess of the
currently measured 116.5 kpc (Vivas et al. 2019), and thus,
it would have formed in a relatively isolated environment.
In fact, even its currently calculated apocenter is similar to
that of Milky Way dSph satellites such as Carina or Fornax
that show extended star formation and were classified by
slow dwarfs by Gallart et al. (2015). Its apocenter is also
not unlike the estimated current distance between M31 and
And XVI. Given the more eccentric orbit of Crater II compared to Carina and Fornax, the closer perigalacticon, possibly combined with the lower mass, would have resulted
in a more efficient stripping of the gas in Crater II than in
the other two galaxies, and thus resulted in an earlier cessation of its star formation. Some characteristics betraying
the slow nature of Crater II may still noticeable. The observational search for stripping remnants mentioned above,
and a detailed star formation history, carefully dealing with
field star subtraction and modeling the HB and MSTO SGB regions in particular, will help to better delineate the
evolutionary history of this intriguing galaxy.
