Abstract:
The study of protein functions attributed to the conformation and fluctuation that are ruled
by both the amino acid sequence and thermodynamics, requires thermodynamic quantities given
by calorimetry using thermometric techniques. The increased need for protein function in
different applications requires improvements of measurement systems assessing protein
thermodynamics to handle many kinds of samples quickly. We have developed a passive
millimeter-wave microscope that allows near-field imaging of thermal radiation, even in the low
temperature range under room temperature where passive infrared imaging systems are
ineffective. This advantage of our microscope system in combination with low thermal emission
property of water ice in the millimeter-wave region enables the characterization of the thermal
radiation from the proteins themselves in aqueous solution at a temperature range low enough to
freeze water and to trap conformation intermediates in the proteins. Experiments performed at a
millimeter-wave frequency of 50 GHz in a temperature range from 130 K to 270 K for a 20 %
bovine serum albumin (BSA) aqueous solution showed a displacement between two
conformational states of BSA at a temperature of approximately 190 K as a boundary. Our
microscope system using this freeze-trapping method is expected to provide noninvasive thermal
images to enable novel high-throughput calorimetry useful for the analysis of protein functions.

1. Introduction:
Proteins function with high efficiency, specificity, and accuracy as a building block of life.
Their flexible structure thermally fluctuates with many motions over broad timescales ranging
from milliseconds to picoseconds. Each protein function provides evidence that motions in its
protein fluctuation are not just random but are related to biological functionality, with routine
exchanges among structural states [1]. Many studies by time-resolved crystallographic methods,
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and a range of other biophysical techniques and
computational methods have demonstrated an intricate view of the multiple conformations of
proteins to relate their functions [1, 2, 3]. Many biological processes such as protein folding and
conformational changes leading to physiological functions like catalysis and signaling occur on
the slow timescale from micro- to milliseconds at physiological temperature, indicating that the
collective motions of large-scale groups of amino acids in protein that correspond to the slow
timescale are important in protein functions [1, 4, 5]. Because all motions are activated by
thermal energy, at sufficiently low temperature — generally below 200 K for most of the
collective motions — insufficiency of thermal energy ceases individual motions and prevents
protein functions [1, 2]. This means that a sufficiently low temperature to limit the collective
motions consisting of conformational states traps protein fluctuations in some intermediates that
are interconverted by jumping over energy barriers between conformational states in the protein
energy landscape. Studies by spectroscopy combined with the freeze-trapping method have
developed the concepts to describe proteins in the relation between function and conformation
transition that is revealed by rising temperature [2, 5, 6, 7].
Understanding protein functions requires information on thermodynamics described by the
free energy including enthalpy and entropy to figure out dynamics in the interconversion of
protein conformations [1, 2]. Calorimetric experiments for proteins have provided
thermodynamic parameters [8]. Two major calorimetric techniques that directly measure heat
change are differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which measures sample heat capacity ( C p )
with respect to a reference sample as a function of temperature, and isothermal titration
3

calorimetry (ITC), which measures the heat change during titration [8, 9]. These methods require
substantial time for either referencing (in DSC) or titration (in ITC) and need to be in contact
with an object in their temperature measurements to achieve heat conduction and a thermal
equilibrium state. Instead of measuring heat directly, calorimetry is also achieved using the
temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants measured by appropriate methods,
according to the van't Hoff relations to obtain enthalpy and heat capacity changes [8, 9].
Although the van't Hoff equation is integrated between two temperatures under the assumption
that the reaction enthalpy is constant, the reaction enthalpy mostly changes in practice, resulting
in an approximate integration [10]. In spite of these disadvantages, estimation of thermodynamic
parameters by calorimetry has contributed to the interpretation of protein dynamics for their
biological relevance [4-9]. These contributions of thermodynamic measurements push forward
the demand for more improvements in calorimetry through extensions of mature technology.
Radiation thermography is another thermometric technique that noninvasively images an
object by detecting electromagnetic radiation thermally emitted from the object over a short time
period, and relates the energy of the thermal radiation to the object temperature using the
emissivity ( ε ) of the object, which is equal to the object's absorptance ( α ), under Planck's law
[11]. Conventional thermographs detect thermal radiation in the infrared region for imaging. The
power of the infrared radiation decreases drastically under 300 K as shown by the red line in Fig.
1, which shows the spectral radiance at 10 µm wavelength as a function of blackbody ( ε = 1 )
temperature calculated by Planck's law [12, 13]. Because of this power decrease, passive infrared
imaging instruments show that approximately 230 K is their limit for low temperature operation.
However, the intensity of the thermal radiation in the millimeter-wave region is proportional to
the temperature down to a few K, as shown with the blue line in Fig. 1, which is the spectral
radiance at a millimeter-wave wavelength of 6 mm. Therefore, thermography using millimeterwave radiation is superior below room temperature to that using infrared radiation.
Thermography using millimeter-wave radiation is insufficient in its wavelength because the
spatial resolution achievable with radiometric imaging system using conventional optics is
4

limited to the wavelength of the operating frequency because of the diffraction effect [14],
causing necessity for preparing a large amount of sample. We have overcome this problem by
developing a tapered near-field slit probe that allows for passive thermal imaging in the
millimeter-wave region with subwavelength spatial resolution below the diffraction limit [15, 16].
Our passive millimeter-wave microscope performed thermal imaging in the temperature range
from room temperature down to 160 K [16]. Because water ice emits negligible thermal radiation
in the millimeter-wave region [17], when our microscope system scans a sample in ice, the
thermal radiation from samples other than solid water should be detected. Our thermometric
technique described in the following has the advantage of enabling the observation of proteins in
frozen aqueous solution in a low temperature range that terminates the slow timescale motions in
proteins.

2. Materials and Methods
We chose an aqueous solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the target sample in this
experiment because BSA is easily obtained and prepared. The properties of BSA have also been
characterized by many biophysical studies including calorimetry by other methods [18-21]. BSA
(initial fraction by heat shock, fraction V, above 98 % purity by electrophoresis) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Japan, (Tokyo, Japan). Twenty (wt/vol) percent aqueous solution of BSA
was prepared with an appropriate amount of purified water.
A passive millimeter-wave microscope system operating at 50 GHz (6 mm wavelength) was
used to observe thermodynamic aspects in thermal radiation emitted from protein samples in ice.
Figure 2 is a schematic drawing of our experimental setup. As a near-field sensor, we used a
tapered slit probe with a 4-section quarter-wave transformer newly developed for this work. The
height of the WR-19 metallic rectangular waveguide for U-band (40-60 GHz) frequencies
reduced to form a slit-like aperture at the probe tip. This type of probe can be operated with high
transmission efficiency [15]. The long and short dimensions of the slit aperture are 4.8 mm and
150 µm, respectively The probe tip was placed in close proximity to the sample. An aluminum
5

sample holder was filled with pure water or a 20 % BSA solution and was placed on a copper
sample stage, which was temperature-controlled using liquid nitrogen (N2) as a coolant and an
electric heater in combination with a temperature controller operating in on/off or proportionalintegral-derivative mode. The temperature of the stage was measured using a thermocouple built
into it just beneath the sample. The sample surface was covered with an 11-µm-thick
polyvinylidene chloride film. The probe-to-sample separation was adjusted to 20 µm using a
piezoelectric transducer and a laser displacement sensor during measurements.
The millimeter-wave radiation thermally emitted from the sample was converted via the slit
aperture into propagating waves in the probe waveguide, which were then detected by the
receiver shown in Fig. 3. The experimental setup shown in Fig. 2 and part of the receiver shown
in Fig. 3 were sited in a chamber made of acrylic resin. The chamber was filled with dry N2 gas
evaporated from liquid N2 to prevent the sample surface from becoming frosted. The
measurement system was installed on an optical bench.
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of the radiometric receiver, which operates in a Dickeswitched mode [22]. The input to the receiver was switched by a PIN diode switch between the
probe and a termination with a repetition frequency of 1 kHz. The output port of the switch was
connected to a low-noise amplifier (LNA) via two isolators connected in series. The output of the
LNA was down-converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) signal with a center frequency of 1
GHz by a single-sideband mixer. The IF bandwidth was 0.4 GHz. The IF signal was amplified
and then detected using a diode detector. The voltage difference between the outputs from the
detector when the probe and the termination were connected was measured using a lock-in
amplifier. The cyan-colored components of the receiver shown in Fig. 3 were sited inside the
chamber. The time constant of the lock-in amplifier was 3 seconds.
3. Theory
The signal processing method for the output from the lock-in amplifier to extract emissivity
information of the BSA sample is described in the following. The incident electromagnetic
energy on an object is divided into whether it is absorbed by the object (absorptance: α ),
6

reflected from the object (reflectance:

r ), and transmitted through the object (transmittance: t ).

The relation between these quantities holds in the forms:

α +r +t =1

(1)

and

ε = α = 1− ( r + t ) ,

(2)

where ε is the emissivity of the object. This emissivity relates the measured energy to the
physical temperature of the object in radiation thermography.
Figure 4 shows how the brightness temperature of the noise signal coming from the probe is
calculated. The probe tip is placed in close proximity to the sample surface. The sample is
characterized by the physical parameters Ts , r , t , and ε , where Ts is the physical temperature.
The sum of the parameters r , t , and ε equals unity because of the energy conservation law and
Kirchhoff's law as shown in Eq. (2). The brightness temperature of the noise signal coming from
the probe T pr can be calculated as

T pr = γ Tr + (1− γ ) {ε Ts + (1− ε ) Tam } ,

(3)

where γ , Tr , and Tam are the reflectance of the probe, the physical temperature of the receiver,
and the ambient temperature that expresses the influence of ambient thermal radiation,
respectively [14, 16]. The first term in the right hand side of Eq. (3) shows the reflection of the
thermal radiation from the receiver that is incident on the probe. The second term on the right
hand side of Eq. (3) shows the transmission of the thermal radiation emitted from the sample
plus the thermal radiation at ambient temperature that is both reflected at the sample surface and
transmitted through the sample via the slit aperture to the probe waveguide.
The output signals of the receiver shown in Fig. 3 when the probe and the termination are
connected S pr and Sterm are written as

(

)

(4)

)

(5)

S pr ∝ T pr + Tsys kGB
and

(

Sterm ∝ Tr + Tsys kGB ,
7

respectively. k , G , B , and Tsys are Boltzmann's constant, the gain of the receiver, the
bandwidth of the receiver, and the system noise temperature of the receiver, respectively. The
output from the lock-in amplifier S is the difference between the above two signals

S ∝ S pr − Sterm = − (1− γ ) Tr + (1− γ ) {ε Ts + (1− ε ) Tam } .

(6)

The output signal that is free from the effect of the mismatch between the probe and the sample

S f can be obtained by dividing S by the transmittance of the probe 1− γ as follows:
Sf =

S
∝ −Tr + ε Ts + (1− ε ) Tam .
1− γ

(7)

Because the emissivity of water ice is negligible [17], the output signals that are free from the
effect of the mismatch when water ice and a BSA solution are taken as a sample S f _ BSA and

S f _ ice can be written as

S f _ BSA =

SBSA
∝ −Tr + ε Ts + (1− ε ) Tam
1− γ BSA

(8)

and

S f _ ice =

Sice
∝ −Tr + Tam ,
1− γ ice

(9)

respectively. ε in Eq. (8) is the emissivity of the BSA sample. SBSA and Sice are the outputs
from the lock-in amplifier when the BSA solution and water ice are used as a sample,
respectively. γ BSA and γ ice are the reflectances of the probe when the BSA solution and water ice
are used, respectively. The signal intensity when the signal of water ice is subtracted from that of
BSA can be calculated as

S f _ BSA − S f _ ice ∝ ε (Ts − Tam ) .

(10)

Equation (10) indicates that when Tam is constant against the variation of Ts or proportional to
Ts , the slope of the signal S f _ BSA − S f _ ice against the sample temperature provides an estimate of

the BSA emissivity.

4. Results and Discussion
Figure 5A shows the voltage outputs from the lock-in amplifier, which are the final output
signals from the measurement system, as functions of the temperature of the sample stage, when
water and a 20% aqueous solution of BSA were placed in an aluminum sample holder,
respectively. On the vertical axis in Fig. 5A, the positive value means that the signal received
from the probe is greater than that from the non-reflective termination kept at environmental
temperature. While the output of water increased proportionally to the temperature of the sample
stage, the output of the BSA solution showed a quite different pattern. Before processing the
outputs in order to extract emissivity information of BSA, the output signals free from the effect
of the mismatch between the probe and each sample should be calculated as shown in Eqs (7)-(9)
because the difference in mismatch causes difference in measurement sensitivity, which should
be compensated.
Figure 5B shows reflectances of the probe as functions of the sample stage temperature
when water and the BSA solution were taken as a sample, respectively. The reflectance value of
zero means there is no mismatch. When measuring the reflectance of the probe, the cyan and
yellow colored components of the receiver shown in Fig. 3 were replaced with a circulator. A
signal from an amplitude-modulated noise source was amplified, and then fed to the probe via
the circulator. The reflected signal from the probe passing through the circulator was recorded
with the receiver. Total reflection was calibrated using a metal plate instead of the probe.
Because the reflectance was measured using an output from a noise source as an input to the
probe and the reflected signal from the probe was measured using a part of the receiver as a
detector, the reflectance of the probe for the thermally emitted noise-like signal was measured
accurately. The signal intensity when the signal of water ice is subtracted from that of BSA as
described in Eq. (10) is shown in Fig. 5C. This result indicates that the signal intensity increases
proportionally to the temperature from 130 K to 170 K and from 230 K to 270 K, but decreases
within the range 170 K to 230 K. Because the output of water ice is proportional to the sample
temperature as shown in Fig. 5A and the reflectance is nearly constant in Fig. 5B, the slope of
9

the signal against the temperature in Fig. 5C provides an estimate of the BSA emissivity. We
found that quantification of the BSA emissivity is possible when the data obtained from a sample
with a known emissivity are available.
The simplest model that explains our results described above is a displacement from an
equilibrium state to another state that has a different emissivity. One equilibrium state below 170
K has an emissivity calculated by linear approximation that is different from that of another state
over 230 K in Fig. 5C. The differentiation of the signal in Fig. 5C with respect to the temperature
gives the result in Fig. 5D, showing a parabola in the temperature range from 170 K to 230 K
with the minimum value at approximately 190 K. This minimum value corresponds to the
reported values in the literature for the glass transition temperature in the case of BSA aqueous
solutions [18-21]. Previous studies for BSA solutions have suggested that this glass transition
originates from the cooperative motion of protein and hydrated water around BSA [18-20].
Because the signal from 170 K to 230 K corresponds to the transition phase between two states,
the minimum value indicates the energy barrier or the activation energy for the transition. In
addition, the relation in which the slope at the lower temperature range is nearly half that at the
higher range in Fig. 5C means that the C p of the conformational state over 230 K of BSA is 2fold larger than that below 170 K because the rate of change in heat emissivity homologous to
heat absorptance under thermal equilibrium conditions is equivalent to the rate of change in C p
after the transition. This result agrees with the study for BSA solution by DSC reporting two

C p s of 5 and 10 kJK-1mol-1 [19].

5. Conclusion
Our experiments show thermodynamics in the transition of structural states in protein as the
transition in emissivity. Advantages of our thermometric method are that the measurement is
noninvasive, information from ice is free, and the system can provide two-dimensional thermal
images [16]. Our system is expected to overcome common problems in protein calorimetry.
These advantages offer potential for the development of thermographic instruments to handle
10

many kinds of samples quickly. Array calorimetry using higher-throughput instruments like ours,
that can scan over arrayed wells that hold different samples made under various conditions, is
required in the assessment of the relation between protein structure and function; for instance, in
structural biology-based drug discovery by characterization of ligand binding by enthalpy [2325].
