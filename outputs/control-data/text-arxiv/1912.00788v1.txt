Abstract. We investigate the secant dimensions and the identifiablity of flag varieties parametrizing flag of
sub vector spaces of a fixed vector space. We give numerical conditions ensuring that secant varieties of flag
varieties have the expected dimension, and that a general point on these secant varieties is identifiable.

1. Introduction
In the most general contest, a flag variety is a projective variety homogeneous under a complex linear
algebraic group. Flag varieties play a central role in algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation
theory [Bri05, BL18].

The geometry of these varieties has been investigated mostly from the point of view of Schubert calculus
[Bri05] and dual defectivity [Tev05]. Secant varieties of small dimensional flag varieties have been studied in
[BD10] by taking advantage of the tropical approach to secant dimensions introduced by J. Draisma in [Dra08].
The h-secant variety Sech (X) of a non-degenerate n-dimensional variety X ⊂ PN is the Zariski closure of
the union of all linear spaces spanned by collections of h points of X. The expected dimension of Sech (X)
is expdim(Sech (X)) := min{nh + h − 1, N }. In general, the actual dimension of Sech (X) may be smaller
than the expected one. In this case, following [CC10, Section 2] we say that X is h-defective and the number
δh (X) = expdim(Sech (X)) − dim(Sech (X)) is called the h-secant defect of X.
We investigate secant defectivity of flag varieties following the machinery introduced in [MR19], which we
now outline. Given general points x1 , . . . , xh ∈ X ⊂ PN , consider the linear projection τX,h : X ⊆ PN 99K PNh ,
with center hTx1 X, . . . , Txh Xi, where Nh := N − 1 − dim(hTx1 X, . . . , Txh Xi). [CC02, Proposition 3.5] yields
that if τX,h is generically finite then X is not (h + 1)-defective. Given p1 , . . . , pl ∈ X general points, we consider
the linear projection ΠT k1 ,...,kl : X ⊂ PN 99K PNk1 ,...,kl with center the span Tpk11 X, . . . , Tpkll X of higher order
p1 ,...,pl
osculating spaces. We can degenerate, under suitable conditions, the linear span of several tangent spaces Txi X
into a subspace contained in a single osculating space Tpk X. So the tangential projection τX,h degenerates to
a linear projection with center contained in Tpk11 X, . . . , Tpkll X . If ΠT k1 ,...,kl is generically finite, then τX,h is
p1 ,...,pl

generically finite as well, and we conclude that X is not (h + 1)-defective. In this paper we apply this strategy
to flag varieties. We would like to stress that this approach, as the one introduced in [Dra08], depends heavily
on an explicit parametrization of X. This method was successfully applied to other classes of homogeneous
varieties such as Grassmannians [MR19], Segre-Veronese varieties [AMR19], Lagrangian Grassmannians and
Spinor varieties [FMR18]. However, its application to flag varieties involves much more difficult computations
compared with the case of the Grassmannians, this is particularly reflected in Section 4 where we introduce
submersions of flag varieties into product of Grassmannians in order to study the relation among their higher
osculating spaces.
Furthermore, our results on secant defectivity, combined with a recent result in [CM19], allow us to produce
a bound for identifiability of flag varieties. Recall that, given a non-degenerated variety X ⊂ PN , we say that
a point p ∈ PN is h-identifiable if it lies on a unique (h − 1)-plane in PN that is h-secant to X. Especially
when PN can be interpreted as a tensor space, identifiablity and tensor decomposition algorithms are central in
applications for instance in biology, Blind Signal Separation, data compression algorithms, analysis of mixture
models psycho-metrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer vision, numerical
analysis, neuroscience and graph analysis [DL13a], [DL13b], [DL15], [KAL11], [SB00], [BK09], [CGLM08],
[LO15], [MR13]. Our main results in Theorem 4.14 and Corollary 4.15 can be summarized in the following
statement.
Theorem 1.1. Consider a flag variety F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n). Assume that n ≥ 2kj + 1 for some index j and let l be
the maximum among these j’s. Then, for
⌊log2 (Plj=1 kj +l−1)⌋

n+1
h≤
kl + 1

F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) is not (h + 1)-defective. Furthermore, under the same bound, the general point of the h-secant
variety of F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) is h-identifiable.
The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we study higher order osculating spaces of products of
Grassmannians and the linear projections from them, in Section 3 we apply the method introduced in [MR19]
to products of Grassmannians, in Section 4 we get bounds for non-secant defectivity and identifiablity of flag
varieties, and in Section 5 we investigate the variety of secant lines of spacial flag varieties of type F(0, k; n).

Given I = {I , . . . , I } ∈ Λ let eI ∈ i=1 G(ki , n) be the point corresponding to eI 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ eI r ∈ PN , and by

Now, fix a pair of indexes (l, m) ∈ {1, . . . , α − 1} × {1, . . . , r} and consider subsets Ij′i ⊆ Iji with |Ij′i | = aj,i for

2.10. Degenerating tangential projections to osculating projections. In this section we study how the
notion of osculating regularity introduced in [MR19] behaves for products of Grassmannians. Let us recall
[MR19, Definition 5.5, Assumption 5.2] and [AMR19, Definition 4.4].
Definition 2.11. Let X ⊂ PN be a projective variety. We say that X has m-osculating regularity if the
following property holds: given general points p1 , . . . , pm ∈ X and an integer s ≥ 0, there exists a smooth curve
C and morphisms γj : C → X, j = 2, . . . , m, such that γj (t0 ) = p1 , γj (t∞ ) = pj , and the flat limit T0 in the

We say that X has strong 2-osculating regularity if the following property holds: given general points p, q ∈ X
and integers s1 , s2 ≥ 0, there exists a smooth curve γ : C → X such that γ(t0 ) = p, γ(t∞ ) = q and the flat limit
T0 in the Grassmannian of the family of linear spaces

For a discussion on the notions of m-osculating regularity and strong 2-osculating regularity we refer to
[MR19, Section 5] and [AMR19, Section 4].
Qr
Proposition 2.12. The variety i=1 G(ki , n) has strong 2-osculating regularity.
Qr
Proof. Let p, q ∈ i=1 G(ki , n) bePgeneral points. We may assume that p = eI1 and q = eI2 with I1 , I2 as in

|J ∩ IjI | = |I ∩ IjI | − l ≥ s(I)−
jI − l ≥ D − k − 1 > s
On the other hand, since J ∈ ∆(K, m)j with j 6= jI we have
|J ∩ IjI | = |K ∩ IjI | ≤ d(K, I1 ) ≤ s
which is a contradiction. Now, note that if K ∈ Λ is such that d(K, I1 ) ≤ s and K ∈ Γ(I), then

d(K, I1 ) = d(I, I1 ) − d(I, K) > 2s + 1 − (s + 1 − D + s(I)−

3. On secant defectivity of products of Grassmannians
Let X ⊂ P

N

be an irreducible non-degenerate variety of dimension n and let
Γh (X) ⊂ X × · · · × X × G(h − 1, N )

where h ≤ N , be the closure of the graph of the rational map α : X × · · · × X 99K G(h − 1, N ) taking h general
points to their linear span hx1 , . . . , xh i. Observe that Γh (X) is irreducible and reduced of dimension hn.
Let π2 : Γh (X) → G(h − 1, N ) be the natural projection, and Sh (X) := π2 (Γh (X)) ⊂ G(h − 1, N ). Again
Sh (X) is irreducible and reduced of dimension hn. Finally, consider
Ih = {(x, Λ) | x ∈ Λ} ⊂ PN × G(h − 1, N )
with natural projections πh and ψh onto the factors.
The abstract h-secant variety is the irreducible variety Sech (X) := (ψh )−1 (Sh (X)) ⊂ Ih . The h-secant variety
is Sech (X) := πh (Sech (X)) ⊂ PN . Then Sech (X) is an (hn + h − 1)-dimensional variety.
The number δh (X) = min{hn + h − 1, N } − dim Sech (X) is called the h-secant defect of X. We say that X
is h-defective if δh (X) > 0. We refer to [Rus03] for a comprehensive survey on the subject.
Determining secant defectivity is a classical problem in algebraic geometry. A new strategy to determine the
non secant defectivity was introduced in [MR19, Theorem 5.3], the method is based on degenerating the span
of several tangent spaces Txi X in a single osculating space Txs X.
To state the criterion for non secant defectivity in [MR19] we introduce a function hm : N≥0 −→ N≥0 counting
how many tangent spaces can be degenerated into a higher order osculating space.
Definition 3.1. Given an integer m ≥ 0 we define a function
hm : N≥0 −→ N≥0
as follows: for hm (0) = 0 and for any k > 0 write
k + 1 = 2λ1 + 2λ2 + · · · + 2λl + ε
where λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λl ≥ 1 and ε ∈ {0, 1}, then
hm (k) = mλ1 −1 + mλ2 −1 + · · · + mλl −1
Theorem 3.2. [MR19, Theorem 5.3] Let X ⊂ PN be a projective variety having m-osculating regularity and
l
strong 2-osculating regularity. Let s1 , . . . , sl ≥ 1 integers such that the general osculating projection Πps11,...,s
,...,pl is
generically finite. If
l
X
hm (sj )
h≤
j=1

then X is not (h + 1)-defective.

Now, we are ready to prove our main result on non-defectivity of product of Grassmannians. We follow the
notation introduced in the previous sections.

4. On secant defectivity of flag varieties
Our goal is to compute the higher osculating spaces of F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n). In order to do this, we will use the
following notion introduced in [FMR18, Definition 3.2].
Definition 4.1. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible variety and Y = Pk ∩ X be a linear section of X. We say that
Y is osculating well-behaved if for each smooth point p ∈ Y we have
Tps Y = Pk ∩ Tps X
for every s ≥ 0.
Let us denote by Mi the following (ki + 1) × (n + 1) matrix

4.8. Non-Secant defectivity of flag varieties. We recall [FMR18, Proposition 4.4] which describes how the
notion of osculating regularity behaves under linear sections.
Proposition 4.9. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible projective variety and Y = Pk ∩ X a linear section of X
that is osculating well-behaved. Assume that given general points p1 , . . . , pm ∈ Y one can find smooth curves
γj : C → X, j = 2, . . . , m, realizing the m-osculating regularity of X for p1 , . . . , pm such that γj (C) ⊂ Y. Then
Y has m-osculating regularity as well. Furthermore, the analogous statement for strong 2-osculating regularity
holds as well.
Proposition 4.10.

- n ≥ kr2 + 3kr + 1 and h ≤ αhα ( kj +
Pr − 2) or
- n < kr2 + 3kr + 1 and h ≤ (α − 1)hα ( kj + r − 2).
Then, F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) is not (h + 1)-defective. In particular, if

⌊log2 (P kj +r−1)⌋
n+1
h≤

then F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) is not (h + 1)-defective.
Proof. The first part is an immediately consequence of Propositions 4.9, 4.7 and Theorem 3.2. For the last
claim note that if we write
X
(4.12)
kj + r − 1 = 2λ1 + 2λ2 + · · · + 2λl + ε

with λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λl ≥ 1 and ε ∈ {0, 1}. Then
X
hα (
kj + r − 2) = αλ1 −1 + αλ2 −1 + · · · + αλl −1

Therefore, the first bound in Theorem 4.11 yields

h ≤ αλ1 + αλ2 + · · · + αλl
Furthermore, by the second bound in Theorem 4.11 we get that F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) is not (h + 1)-defective for
h ≤ (α − 1)(αλ1 −1 + αλ2 −1 + · · · + αλl −1 )

Finally, by (4.12) we get that λ1 = ⌊log2 ( kj + r − 1)⌋. Hence, asymptotically we

F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) is not (h + 1)-defective.

Remark 4.13. Now, given a flag F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) with n < 2kr + 1. Assume that n ≥ 2kj + 1 for some index j
and let l be the maximum among these j’s. Then we have a natural projection
π

: F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) −→ F(k1 , . . . , kl ; n)
{Vi }i=1,...,r
7−→ {Vi }i=1,...,l

The fiber of π over a general point in F(k1 , . . . , kl ; n) is isomorphic to F(kl+1 − kl − 1, . . . , kr − kl − 1; n − kl − 1).
Now let p1 , . . . , ph ∈ F(k1 , . . . , kl ; n) be general points, and Tpi F(k1 , . . . , kl ; n) be the tangent space at pi . Then,
we have
Tπ−1 (pi ) F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) = Tpi F(k1 , . . . , kl ; n), Tπ−1 (pi ) F(kl+1 − kl , . . . , kr − kl ; n − kl )
and Tpi F(k1 , . . . , kl ; n) ∩ Tπ−1 (pi ) F(kl+1 − kl , . . . , kr − kl ; n − kl ) = ∅.
Now, observe that if Tπ−1 (pi ) F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) ∩ Tπ−1 (pj ) F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) 6= ∅ then
dim Tπ−1 (pj ) F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) ; j = 1, . . . , h ≤ h dim F(k1 , . . . , kl ; n) + h − 2
Since Tπ−1 (pi ) F(kl+1 − kl − 1, . . . , kr − kl − 1; n − kl − 1) is contracted by π for any j = 1, . . . , h we have that
dim π(T ) ≤
=

h dim F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) + h − 2 − h dim F(kl+1 − kl , . . . , kr − kl ; n − kl )
h dim F(k1 , . . . , kl ; n) + h − 2

where T = Tπ−1 (pi ) F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) ; i = 1, . . . , h .
In particular, by Terracini’s lemma [Ter12] we have that if F(k1 , . . . , kl ; n) is not h-defective, then F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n)
is not h-defective.
Theorem 4.14. Consider a flag variety F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) with n < 2kr + 1. Assume that n ≥ 2kj + 1 for some
index j and let l be the maximum among these j’s. Then, for


n+1
h≤

F(k1 , . . . , kr ; n) is not (h + 1)-defective.
Proof. It is an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.11 and Remark 4.13.

4.14. On identifiability of products of Grassmannians and flag varieties. Let X ⊂ PN be an irreducible
non-degenerated variety. A point p ∈ PN is said to be h-identifiable, with respect to X, if it lies on a unique
(h − 1)-plane h-secant to X. Furthermore, X is said to be h-identifiable if a general point of Sech (X) is
h-identifiable.
Now, we combine our bounds on non-secant defectivity of products of Grassmannians and flag varieties and
[CM19, Theorem 3] to get the following.

5. On the chordal variety of F(0, k; n)
In this section we consider particularly flag varieties parametrizing chains of type p ∈ H k ⊂ Pn .
Proposition 5.1. Let us consider the flag variety F(0, k; n) ⊂ P(Γ) ⊂ PN , where 0 < k < n. Then,
Sec2 F(0, k; n) has always the expected dimension except when k = n − 1, in this case F(0, n − 1; n) is 2-defective
with 2-defect δ2 (F(0, n − 1; n)) = 1.
Proof. Let p, q ∈ F(0, k; n) be two general points, without lose the generality we can assume that p = e0,{0,...,k} =
e0,I0 and q = en,{n−k,...,n} = en,I1 .
Now, Proposition 4.4 yields that
Te0,I0 F(0, k; n) = hei,I | d((i, I), (0, I0 )) ≤ 1i ∩ P(Γ)
and
Ten,I1 F(0, k; n) = hei,I | d((i, I), (n, In )) ≤ 1i ∩ P(Γ)
Note that d((i, I), (0, I0 )) = 1 if and only if either i 6= 0 and I = I0 or i = 0 and |I ∩ I0 | = k. Similarly,
d((i, I), (n, I1 )) = 1 if and only if either i 6= n and I = I1 or i = n and |I ∩ I1 | = k. Therefore, since n 6= 0 and
I1 6= I0 we have that ei,I ∈ {ei,I | d((i, I), (0, I0 )) ≤ 1} ∩ {ei,I | d((i, I), (n, I1 )) ≤ 1} if and only if either I = I0
and i = n or I = I1 and i = 0.
Now, assume that I = I0 and i = n, this is ei,I ∈ Te0,I0 F(0, k; n) ∩ Ten,I1 F(0, k; n), in particular we have
|I ∩ I1 | = |I0 ∩ I1 | = k and hence {1, . . . , k} ⊂ I1 once 0 ∈
/ I1 . So we must have k = n − 1. Similarly, if
I = I1 and i = 0 we conclude that k = n − 1.
Therefore, if k < n − 1, we get
{ei,I | d((i, I), (0, I0 )) ≤ 1} ∩ {ei,I | d((i, I), (n, I1 )) ≤ 1} = ∅
and hence
{ei,I | d((i, I), (0, I0 )) ≤ 1} ∩ {ei,I | d((i, I), (n, I1 )) ≤ 1} ∩ P(Γ) = ∅
which implies that
dim Te0,I0 F(0, k; n), Ten,I1 F(0, k; n) = 2 dim F(0, k; n) + 1
So, Terracini’s lemma [Ter12] yields that Sec2 F(0, k; n) has the expected dimension whenever k < n − 1.
Now, assume that k = n − 1. In this case we have
{ei,I | d((i, I), (0, I0 )) ≤ 1} ∩ {ei,I | d((i, I), (n, I1 )) ≤ 1} = {e0,{1,...,n} , en,{0,...,n−1} }
Furthermore, F(0, n − 1; n) is the hypersurface cutting out in Pn × Pn∗ by
n
X

(−1)i Zi,In \{i} = 0

i=0

where In = {0, . . . , n}.
Therefore, we get that Te0,I0 F(0, n − 1; n) = hei,I | d((i, I), (0, I0 )) ≤ 1i ∩ P(Γ) is given by



0, {1, . . . , n}
e0,{1,...,n} + (−1)n+1 en,{0,...,n−1} ; ei,I | d((i, I), (0, I0 )) ≤ 1 and i, I 6=
n, {1, . . . , n − 1}

and Ten,I1 F(0, n − 1; n) = hei,I | d((i, I), (n, I1 )) ≤ 1i ∩ P(Γ) is given by

en,{0,...,n−1} ; ei,I | d((i, I), (n, I1 )) ≤ 1 and i, I 6=
n, {1, . . . , n − 1}
Therefore,
dim Te0,I0 F(0, n − 1; n), Ten,I1 F(0, n − 1; n) = 2 dim F(0, n − 1; n) < expdim Sec2 F(0, n − 1; n)
Finally, since expdim Sec2 F(0, k; n) = 2 dim F(0, n − 1; n) + 1 we have that F(0, n − 1, n) is 2-defective with
2-defect δ2 (F(0, n − 1; n)) = 1.
