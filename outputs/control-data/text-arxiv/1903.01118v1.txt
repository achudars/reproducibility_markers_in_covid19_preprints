Abstract. I will review the tips learned from panchromatic modeling of active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), based on our recent work to study the relationship between AGN and star formation
(SF). Several AGN SED models are compared, and significant AGN contribution is found in the
IR luminosities and corresponding star formation rate (SFR). I will review the AGN-SF relation
and how different parameters and sample selections affect the observed correlation. I will then
report on the constant ratio discovered between the SFR and the black hole mass accretion
rate (BHAR), and their implications on the gas supply and galaxy formation history of these
systems. Caveats and important questions to answer are summarized at the end.
Keywords: galaxies: active, galaxies: evolution, X-rays: galaxies, infrared: galaxies

1. Introduction
Twenty years have passed since the empirical connections found between the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass (M• ) and properties of their host galaxies, including the stellar velocity dispersion (M-σ), the bulge luminosity, and the bulge mass by
e.g. Magorrian et al.(1998), Marconi & Hunt (2003). The stellar mass-M• ratio shows a
larger variation than the bulge mass-M• ratios, which ranges from a few hundreds to a
few thousands. This possibly indicates intrinsically different relations for different galaxy
types (Marconi & Hunt (2003), Kormendy & Ho(2013), Reines & Volonteri(2015)).
Given their significantly different sizes and masses, the finding of these correlations
triggered the search for the intrinsic physical drive that connects SMBHs and galaxies. Various evolution models have been proposed, including the merger theory, e.g.,
Hopkins et al.(2006), the cold-flow scheme, e.g., Springel et al.(2005), or purely mathematical model, e.g., Peng (2007). In these models, AGN feedback is often needed to
modulate the process, locally or globally, in forms of winds, jets or radiation perturbations, e.g., Fabian(2012).
In practice, statistical samples of AGNs or star forming galaxies are used to study the
AGN-SF relation. Typical sample selection utilizes the fact the AGN and SF dominate different parts of the spectrum. AGNs are often selected in the X-ray, e.g., Lutz et al.(2010),
Mullaney et al.(2012), Dai et al.(2018), or by highly ionized and often wide optical lines,
e.g., Netzer(2009), Matsuoka & Woo(2015), Harris et al.(2016), while IR luminosity or
certain lines (e.g Hα) is chosen to represent SF. Since AGN selections in the X-ray and
optical are not targeting the same nucleus regions, and optical lines and infrared luminosities are not tracing the same SF regions (gas vs cold dust), direct comparisons could
be confusing. Recently, Dai et al.(2018) constructed a sample of IR-bright AGNs, with
detections in both the X-ray and far-IR, aiming to focus on the phase where both BH
accretion and SF are active.

2. SED Analysis
SED decomposition is one of the most common practices to derive the relative luminosities of AGN and SF components. This is typically achieved by fitting models,

either using existing de-composition codes (e.g. CIGALE, MagPhys, GRASIL), or users’
own decomposition templates, e.g. Rosario et al.(2018), Rivera et al.(2016). Despite large
scatter, the AGN mean SEDs have shown surprising uniformity over z, luminosity, and
Eddington ratios (e.g., Elvis et al.(1994), Richards et al.(2006), Dai et al.(2012)), with a
big-blue-bump in the UV-optical, a near-IR bump, followed by a not-so-well-constrained
far-IR decline due to lack of observation data. With Herschel, a separation between the
younger, far-IR bright population and the older, far-IR faint AGN population has been
reported by e.g., Dai et al.(2012).
In Fig. 1, we compare the AGN IR SED models from Elvis et al.(1994), Richards et al.(2006),
Mullaney et al.(2011), Dai et al.(2012), and Dale et al.(2014). A general consistency (∼
0.2 dex) is found for the integrated IR luminosities (8-1000µm, normalized at 6 µm)
amongst different models. Counter-intuitively, after removing the near- to mid- IR—
believed to be dominated by AGN thus affected by AGN variability, a larger discrepancy
(∼0.6 dex) is found in the far-IR (30-1000µm). The intrinsic variation of the AGN SED
in the far-IR, and the interpolation for some of the templates, could both contribute to
this far-IR inconsistency. The total variation, though, is still 6 1 dex. To better use the
known information in the X-ray, we developed a 3-step AGN IR decomposition method
as described in Dai et al.(2018). Average AGN contributions of 23% and 11% are found
for the total and far IR luminosities, respectively. We conclude that AGN removal is
essential, but uncertain, in the IR.

3. AGN-SF correlation in two formats
3.1. LSFR /LAGN ratio
Observationally, various, sometimes contradictory correlations have been reported between AGN and SF luminosities, be it suppressed SFR in luminous AGN host by e.g.,
Page et al.(2012), Barger et al.(2015); or flat or unrelated AGN-SF luminosities by e.g.,
Stanley et al.(2015)); or bi-modality and overall linear correlations, often with a sampledependent correlation coefficient, by e.g. Lutz et al.(2010), Harris et al.(2016), Pitchford et al.(2016),
Shimizu et al.(2017), Dai et al.(2018). We note that AGN populations may be intrinsically different at the X-ray luminous and faint ends, as indicated by observations of X-ray
bright sources with ALMA and SCUBA2, also indicated by the bi-modality mentioned
above. Therefore, one has to be careful in interpreting the observed trend when stacking
in the X-ray or IR is used.
3.2. SFR/BHAR ratio
The radio between BHAR and SFR can be used to avoid a false correlation due to

z effect. Although with a scatter of ∼0.5 dex, we found a constant SFR/BHAR ratio
over z, M• , and M∗ , with the Ṁ ratio mostly in the log (SFR/BHAR)= 2.6-3.6 range
(Fig. 2). This is consistent with the scenario that on an average basis, the galaxy and
the black hole form at a fixed rate similar to the locally observed mass ratio. Though
with large error bars, some recent studies show a M∗ dependence of this Ṁ ratio, e.g.,
Yang et al.(2017), Cowley et al.(2018), while others find a constant ratio independent of
M∗ , e.g. Mullaney et al.(2012), Dai et al., (in prep).
3.3. Caveats of the correlation studies
• Malmquist bias is prevalent, which could result in false increase at the luminous end.
• Sample-dependence is important. Fig. 3 illustrates a simplified picture assuming that
the AGN-SF correlation only exists during the active phase, during which AGNs coexist
with active star formation, resulting in the observed fixed-fraction of gas inflow. This
explains the flattening slopes found in samples with higher fraction of obscured objects,
e.g. recovered by stacks in the X-ray.
• The choice of binning results in different correlation slopes, or the lack of any correlation. This can be due to 1) the different variability time scale for AGNs and SF; 2) purely
mathematical effects due to choices of the dependent parameters (Reines & Volonteri(2015),
Dai et al.(2018)).

Based on SED analysis of the IR-bright AGN sample in Dai et al.(2018), we found:
(a) LAGN -LIR,SF, and SFR-BHAR correlations have been confirmed by various observational studies, consistent with the
scenario of a common gas/mass supply(c)formain

(b) A nearly constant ratio of log(SFR/BHAR) ∼ 2.9 is observed, agreeing with the
local stellar mass vs SMBH mass ratios, indicating homogeneous evolution across z. The
effect of M∗ is still debatable and under investigation.
(c) Several caveats can potentially mask out an intrinsic AGN-SF correlations, e.g. 1).
intrinsic scatter and uncertainties (∼0.5 dex) due to various SFR & BHAR estimators;
2). Selection bias and Malmquist bias; 3). Mixing of different populations by stacking
and sample selection; 4). Binning method (variability, choice of free parameter).
Future studies need to construct a clean AGN sample, of similar physical properties,

Discussion
David Rosario: Existing work on panchromatic modelling (e.g., Rosario+2018) do
include x-ray constraints. An important bias is that luminous AGN tend to be in more
massive hosts, which, regardless of AGN, do show higher SFRs. How does this affect
LAGN − LSFR relationships?
Dai Y.Sophia: Good point. The higher AGN fraction at the luminous massive end
is likely to contribute to the increase in SFR in general. Thus it is helpful to make
the comparison in a mass normalized fashion, i.e. LAGN /M∗ vs SFR, or LAGN /MBH vs
SFR/M∗ , or LAGN /MBH vs SFR. It would be interesting to see how these parameters
look in large samples. A possible bias would be the uncertainties in the mass estimates.
