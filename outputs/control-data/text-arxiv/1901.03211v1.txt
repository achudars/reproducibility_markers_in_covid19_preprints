Abstract
In this paper, we examine both stability and sustainability of a network-based model of natural resource consumption. Stability is studied from a dynamical systems perspective, though we argue that sustainability is a fundamentally
different notion from stability in social- ecological systems. Accordingly, we also present a criterion for sustainability
that is guided by the existing literature on sustainable development. Assuming a generic social network of consuming
agents’ interactions, we derive sufficient conditions for both the stability and sustainability of the model as constraints
on the network structure itself. We complement these analytical results with numerical simulations and discuss the
implications of our findings for policy-making for sustainable resource governance.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Sustainability of social-ecological systems has been a subject of considerable interest for some time [1]. However,
despite its importance, sustainability of this kind is still far from being adequately defined in a rigorous context. The
confusion stems directly from the definition of sustainable development itself, given by the Brundtland Commision of
the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) [2], which leaves much room for interpretation.
This has led to a string of research spanning across multiple disciplines in search of a formal definition of the
concept [3], [4], [5].
From a dynamical systems perspective, sustainability has often been linked to developments in [6], [7], and
sometimes even used interchangeably with stability in social-ecological systems [8]. We argue that while stability is
indeed relevant in this setting, it is a purely dynamical systems property that does not appropriately account for the
ecological nature of the system. Thus a separate formulation of sustainability is needed. This need is underscored by
the rising interest of the controls community not only in social-ecological systems, but also in other systems lying at
the interface of technological, ecological, and social sciences. Such systems are collectively termed “cyber-physical
social systems” [9].

In this paper we study the stability and sustainability of a social-ecological system whose model was first presented
and studied in [10]. The model is for a natural resource being harvested by a fixed number of consuming agents.
While deciding their consumption, the agents not only take information about the resource into account, but also
incorporate information about the consumption of other neighboring agents. The social network of the population
thus plays a critical role in determining overall system behavior, and it must also affect sustainability in any sense
that is considered. Indeed, it has been found [1] that the ability of a population to sustainably manage its resources
at the community level is highly dependent on the underlying social network of that community.
Accordingly, the insights provided by the network structure have resulted in an increase in the application of
network analysis tools to natural resource systems [11], [12]. For instance, social structure has been observed to
be strongly correlated with pro-environmental behavior in social-ecological settings [13]. Information about the
structure of the network has also been exploited in the past to identify elements critical to sustainable governance
of a resource (for some representative studies, see [14], [15], [16]). Previously, our selected model of resource
consumption has been studied only under restrictive assumptions on the network topology [17].
In this paper, we maintain a generic network structure to fully understand the effects of the social network on
sustainability of its resource. A complete characterization of sustainable communities remains an open problem for
the scientific community. This has been attributed in part to the highly inter-disciplinary nature of the field and
a lack of integrative studies to unify the research that remains scattered among different strands of work [18]. In
this paper we devise a criterion for sustainability that is subsequently applied to our network model of resource
consumption. This results in structural conditions on the network topology which, we believe, contributes a step
towards uncovering the structural characteristics of sustainable societies.
In what follows, we develop a sustainability criterion that draws from the literature on sustainable development.
This criterion is based on a rigorous definition of sustainability that we introduce, and we show how the enforcement
of system sustainability is translated into conditions on the network topology and its associated parameters. We
apply this criterion to a network model of resource-consuming agents and compare it with sufficient conditions for
stability. To that end, we also present a novel proof of stability for the full n-agent model which was previously
known to be stable only for 2 agents [17]. The contributions of this paper thus consist of the stability proof for
the general n-agent model and the sustainability criterion we develop, together with the resulting analyses and
implications for resource consumption networks that we discuss.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II first provides the model of interest. Then, Section III
presents sufficient conditions for stability of the model and a Lyapunov-based stability proof. Section IV next
provides a commentary on the sustainability literature originating from different disciplines. Following guidelines
from this exposition, we also present our mathematical definition of sustainability. In Section V, we obtain sufficient
conditions for system sustainability in the form of constraints on the structure of its underlying social network.
Section VI presents simulations of both stable and sustainable networks along with a discussion on the implications
for policy making. We conclude in Section VII.

II. BACKGROUND AND N ETWORK M ODEL
This section describes the system model of interest and its coupled resource and consumption dynamics. The
model was first presented in [10] and subsequently studied in [17], [19], [20]. For full details on the environmental
and social-psychological foundations of the model, we refer the reader to the sources mentioned above. Here we
present a non-dimensionalized version of the model (also introduced in [10]) that not only has a reduced parameter
space, but also allows more straightforward interpretations of the results relative to the original model.
The setting is that of a single natural resource whose stock renews according to the standard model of logistic
growth [21]. The resource has an associated carrying capacity and intrinsic growth rate that affect the evolution of
its value over time. Let x(t) > 0 represent the resource quantity at time t relative to its carrying capacity. Thus
x(t) = 1 implies that at time t the resource stock is at its environmental carrying capacity. The resource is harvested
by a consuming population consisting of n agents. Each agent harvests the resource by exerting some effort, and,
in this model, this effort constitutes all the different dimensions of harvesting activity. In fishing for instance, it can
capture the number of boats deployed, their efficiency, the number of days fishing is undertaken, etc. [21]
Let yi (t) ∈ R represent the consumption effort of agent i relative to the rate of growth of the resource; a
consumption effort of yi (t) = 1 implies a consumption rate that is equal to the intrinsic growth rate of the resource.
The resource dynamics are then given by
ẋ(t) = (1 − x(t))x(t) − x(t)

n
X

yi (t),

i=1

where i ∈ {1, . . . , n} indexes the agents in the network. Note that the model permits a negative consumption rate.
From the dynamics of the resource it is evident that this may result in x(t) taking on values greater than unity,
which corresponds to the stock level crossing the natural carrying capacity of the environment. In [10] we discuss
the physical interpretations of this phenomenon in detail. While a positive consumption rate represents an effort to
consume the resource (thereby decreasing its stock), a negative rate corresponds to an action to increase the stock
of the resource. This includes actions that directly increase the stock (such as planting trees or breeding fish) as well
as more indirect actions (such as restoration of soil fertility or a favorable distribution of gear to local fishermen).
These actions may also be directed towards artificially increasing the carrying capacity, e.g., de-silting water canals,
increasing the land available for forest growth, shifting to more intensive farming techniques, etc.
Next we present the dynamics of the individual consumption efforts yi (t). According to Festinger’s theory of
social comparison processes [22], while making decisions, humans incorporate both objective information and social
information. In the context of resource consumption [23], the objective information is interpreted as information
on the state of the resource, i.e., whether it is abundant or scarce. We model this through the scarcity threshold
ρi > 0 associated with agent i. The state of the resource is then captured by the ecological factor (x(t) − ρi (t)). A
negative ecological factor indicates that agent i perceives the resource as scarce, whereas a positive factor indicates
that agent i perceives the resource to be abundant. The social information is interpreted as the difference between
agent i’s consumption level and the consumption levels of other neighboring agents. This is represented by the social

factor

j=1

The rate of change of consumption effort is then represented as a weighted sum of the ecological and social
factors. These are weighed by the ecological and social weights αi ∈ [0, 1] and νi ∈ [0, 1], respectively (these terms
are also referred to as the social and ecological relevances of agent i below). Since the weighing of both factors in
the final decision-making is observed to be one-dimensional [22], the weights sum to one, i.e., αi + νi = 1 for all
i. Thus the consumption dynamics are given by

where bi > 0 is called the sensitivity of agent i and represents the readiness of agent i to change her consumption.
Based on the above, the coupled dynamics of the resource stock and consumption effort are

where i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. In Equation (1), t is non-dimensional time which is normalized with respect to the resource
growth rate. In [10], we have discussed how this normalization reduces the dimension of the parameter space relative
to the original model, along with interpretations of the various variables and their domains, and we refer the reader
to that reference for an extended discussion of the subject.
III. S TABILITY OF N ETWORKED R ESOURCE C ONSUMPTION
This section proves that the network consumption model in Section II is asymptotically stable. We first rewrite
the dynamics as an equivalent aggregate-level resource and consumption system and then transform this system
into one whose equilibrium is at the origin. Then we provide a Lyapunov-based stability proof. Below, we use
diag(a1 , . . . , an ) to denote the diagonal matrix with the scalars a1 through an on its main diagonal.
A. Aggregate Network Dynamics
We define the states γ = ln x and y = (y1 , . . . , yn )T along with the matrices A = diag(α1 , . . . , αn ), B = diag(b1 , . . . , bn ),
and V = diag(ν1 , . . . , νn ). We further define the vector ρ = (ρ1 , . . . , ρn )T and the matrix of weights

Differentiating γ and y with respect to time gives
γ̇ =

ẋ
= 1 − x − 1T y
x

ẏ = BA(eγ 1 − ρ) − BV T y.
In this form, we impose the following assumptions.
Assumption 1: The matrix (A11T + V T )−1 exists and

1T A11T + V T

−1

A(1 − ρ) < 1.

4

Below, Assumption 1 will be used to insure that γ0 and y0 , the respective equilibria of the γ and y dynamics, are
well-defined.
Assumption 2: The underlying graph connecting agents is strongly connected.

4

Assumption 2 is a common assumption in multi-agent networks. Strong connectivity implies, roughly, that there
is “enough” interaction among agents to drive the state of the system toward its equilibrium point, and this notion
will be made precise in Theorem 1.
Assumption 3: For all agent indices i ∈ {1, . . . , n},
θi ≥

n
X

ωki θk .

4

k=1
k6=i

Because θi =

νi
αi ,

we can regard θi as measure of how social agent i is. Assumption 3 then requires that agent i’s

outgoing influence, measured upon agent k through ωki , be limited based on its own sociability. To influence other
highly social agents, agent i must itself be more social. Conversely, if agent i is less social, then it will have a
smaller value of θi , and the weights of its outgoing edges must be smaller.
Computing the equilibrium of these dynamics, we set γ̇ = 0, which gives γ0 = ln(1 − 1T y0 ). To find y0 , we
have ẏ = 0 = B(A1eγ0 − Aρ − V T y0 ) where solving for y0 gives y0 = (A11T + V T )−1 A(1 − ρ), which is
well-defined under Assumption 1.
To shift this system’s equilibrium to the origin, we then define the states v = γ − γ0 and w = y − y0 . Computing
v̇ and ẇ, we find
v̇ = −eγ0 (ev − 1) − 1T w

(2a)

ẇ = eγ0 BA1(ev − 1) − BV T w.
B. Global Asymptotic Stability
The following theorem shows that the system model in Equation (2) is globally asymptotically stable. Due to its
technical nature, we relegate the proof to the appendix.
Theorem 1: The system in Equation (2) is globally asymptotically stable to the origin.
Proof: See the Appendix.

While stability is of course critical to insuring acceptable asymptotic network behaviors, stability as a purely
dynamical systems notion does not account for the fact that this is a resource consumption network. The value of

the resource itself must be sustained over time, and thus its dynamics and those of the agents’ consumptions must
be accounted for not only in the limit, but also at each point in time as the system evolves. Accordingly, we next
assess the role of sustainability in this system.
IV. F ORMALIZING S USTAINABILITY
In the quest for attaining sustainable societies, one of the biggest challenges is formalizing a notion of sustainability. The Brundtland Commission of the WCED [2] defines sustainable development as “development that
meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.
Clearly, this definition leaves much room for interpretation, and a vast amount of literature is devoted to developing a
definitive measure of sustainability. As a result, there exist varying notions of sustainability originating from different
disciplines ranging from the ecological sciences [3] to economics [24]. These discrepancies create significant
difficulty in characterizing sustainable behavior in the rigorous framework of dynamical systems.
It is quite natural to think of sustainable consumption in social-ecological systems as a state in which the level of
consumption is allowed to be non-decreasing [25]. On the other hand, it is broadly understood that a continuously
increasing consumption is not realizable in a finite world with limited resources [26]. Sustainability would then
imply an indefinitely maintainable level of consumption, which corresponds to attaining a positive equilibrium. It
is not surprising therefore, that stability has been closely linked with sustainability by researchers working in the
area (see for instance [6], [7], [8]).
However, while stability is roughly understood to be a necessary property for sustainability, it is not sufficient [7].
In particular, from an economical viewpoint, Chichilnisky [4] argues that sustainability should not only rely on the
behavior of the consumption path in the limit (as time approaches infinity), but also on the accumulated utility for
all time. From an ecological perspective, an ecosystem can remain functional only if its critical parameters remain
within a certain region over time [27], which likewise suggests the use of some non-asymptotic analysis.
Martinet formalizes this phenomenon in his definition for sustainability as bounds on certain sustainability
indicators [5]. He then defines a sustainability criterion as a generalized maximin problem in search of the bounds
that are optimal with respect to certain preference functions. The boundedness of system response is captured by
the concept of Lagrange stability in dynamical systems theory [28]. Lagrange stability has also been related in the
ecological literature with the ability of an ecosystem to resist disturbances [7]. However Lagrange stability (along
with other classical notions of stability [29]) is an absolute property of the system rather than its trajectories. This
poses a challenge in prioritizing different trajectories based on their level of sustainability. In other words, stability
alone does not capture the nuances of sustainability.
Beyond stability, another property of the system that is closely linked with sustainability is resilience. Holling [30]
defines resilience as the ability of a system to maintain its integrity when subjected to disturbances. From a dynamical
systems viewpoint, this property can be related to how rapidly or gradually a system moves towards an equilibrium.
For social-ecological systems, a sudden change in consumption patterns may trigger a major regime change in the
underlying habitat accommodating the natural resource, which in turn may cause unpredictable and undesirable

changes in the resource stock itself. Thus, a consumption path must not vary at more than a certain rate for it to be
sustainable. The notion of sustainability as permitting a non-decreasing consumption path already implies a lower
bound on the derivative of the consumption trajectory [31]. However the above argument also implies an upper
bound on the derivative. It is important to note that while a limit on the rate of change of the trajectories protects
the system from loss of resilience, it also further reflects the physical limits associated with the rate of resource
growth and harvesting.
Even across the different notions of sustainability present in the literature, e.g., [25], [31], [32], [33], the underlying
philosophy remains the same: sustainability entails preserving essential system characteristics over a sufficiently
long period of time. What distinguishes these notions then, is the different perspectives on what characteristics of
the system must persist and for how long. Costanza and Patten [7] assert that sustainability is highly dependent
on the scale at which the system is perceived. In particular, the sustainability of a larger system does not imply
the sustainability of all of its subsystems. For example, cells and bacteria die periodically in order for a larger
organism to sustain its life, or a small city may be consumed by construction of a dam in order to promote the
sustainability of the region as a whole. The losses of these smaller subsystems prolong the sustainability of the larger
systems, though it is broadly understood that this does not provide “maintenance forever” of the larger system [34].
Sustainability thus cannot imply an infinite lifetime. Rather, it implies that the system achieves its expected lifespan,
and this lifespan depends both on the temporal and spatial scales of the system of interest [34].
In light of the above discussion, it is possible to identify the salient features that we can use to mathematically
encode sustainability. These are listed in sequence below:
•

First, sustainability should be evaluated over finite intervals. This reflects that sustainability of a system does
not necessarily mean indefinite survival, but rather the attainment of its expected lifespan [7]. As discussed
above, this lifespan depends on the natural temporal and spatial scales of a system.

•

Second, sustainability should provide criteria pointwise in time as opposed to only at the steady-state behavior
of a system. Sustainability concerns itself not only with the generation in the time limit, but also with the
current generation and all others in between [2]. Thus, rather than being asymptotic, a definition of sustainability
should account for all states of a system over time [4], [25].

•

Third, sustainability should be a structural property of a system [27]. From a systems perspective, the structure
of the system determines the characteristics that are essential to attaining a particular state of being. In this
context, sustainability may be thought of as the invariance of a particular quantity (mediated by the internal
structure) that captures the required behavior. The model in Section II is a networked system, and the “structure”
of this system consists of both its topology and associated edge weights, which are encapsulated by the matrix T .

Following the guidelines listed above, we develop a mathematical formulation of sustainability as follows. First,
we consider sustainability for systems across the time horizon [0, tmax ] for some tmax > 0. Second, we define the
following four constants:
1) vmax , the maximum allowable value of v
2) vmin , the minimum allowable value of v

January 11, 2019

DRAFT

8

3) dmax , the maximum allowable value of v̇
4) dmin , the minimum allowable value of v̇,
where d is chosen to indicate “derivative”.
Together, the four constants listed above define a box in the (v, v̇)-plane, and sustainability of a system is
equivalent to invariance of this box. We emphasize that the equilibrium of v need not be in this box, which further
highlights the distinction between stability and sustainability. Sustainability can then be formally expressed as an
invariance condition. We define the subset S of the (v, v̇)-plane as
S :=




v, v̇ | v ≥ vmin , v ≤ vmax , v̇ ≥ dmin , v̇ ≤ dmax ,

and sustainability for a social-ecological system is then defined as follows.

Definition 1: A quantity of resource v(t) is sustainable over [0, tmax ] if v(t), v̇(t) ∈ S for all t ∈ [0, tmax ]. 4
Note that many of the above sustainability notions from the existing literature pertain directly to consumption,
while our mathematical sustainability criterion is stated in terms of the resource. Despite this apparent difference,
we show in Section V below that Definition 1 must account for agents’ consumptions to be satisfied. In particular,
we show how Definition 1 is linked with both the social structure and individual parameters of the consuming
network by deriving conditions on T, A and B that are sufficient to satisfy Definition 1.
V. I NSURING S USTAINABILITY OF N ETWORKED R ESOURCE C ONSUMPTION
The social structure of a resource consumption network is specified both by the graph of agents’ interactions
and the weights of edges in this graph. These values are captured in the matrix T in Equation (2), and this section
will derive conditions on T that insure that v remains at sustainable levels over some pre-specified time horizon
[0, tmax ]. These results require not only accounting for how v evolves, but also how agents’ consumption levels
affect v.
A. Preliminaries
Towards deriving the desired conditions on T , we first give some preliminary results related to v and w that we
will use below. We begin by stating the Bellman-Grönwall inequality in the required form.
Lemma 1: Bellman-Grönwall Inequality; [35]) Let K1 ∈ R and K2 > 0. If, for all t ∈ [a, b], φ : [a, b] → R, the
Rt

bound φ(t) ≤ K1 + K2 a φ(s) ds is satisfied, then on the same interval φ(t) ≤ K1 eK2 (t−a) .
Next, we enforce the following assumption.
Assumption 4: We assume that
•

vmin < vmax

•

vmax > 0

•

vmin < v(0) < vmax

•

dmin < 0 < dmax .

♦

This assumption is rather mild in what it imposes upon the system. Requiring that vmax > 0 and vmax > vmin
insures that a given set of sustainability bounds is feasible. Assuming that vmin < v(0) < vmax merely assumes

January 11, 2019

9

that a system starts within the bounds it must remain within. And requiring that dmin < 0 < dmax means that the
resource levels in a system should be allowed to both increase and decrease, which is natural.
Next, we define the constants β = maxi∈{1,...,n} bi νi , C1 = kw(0)k1 + tmax eγ0 (evmax − 1)

and

C2 = βkT k1 tmax , and we will repeatedly encounter them below. Using Lemma 1 and Assumption 4, we have the
following characterization of w.
Lemma 2: Suppose that v(s) ≤ vmax for all s ∈ [0, t). Then kw(t)k1 ≤ C1 exp(C2 ).
Proof: The fundamental theorem of calculus gives

Using that the 1-norm of a matrix is equal to its largest column sum, the value of kBV k1 is then equal to β
because BV is diagonal. The lemma follows by applying Lemma 1 with K1 = C1 and K2 = C2 .

We next derive a similar bound for v.
Lemma 3: Suppose that v(s) ≤ vmax for all s ∈ [0, t). Under the dynamics in Equation (2), we find that

v(t) ≥ v(0) − tmax eγ0 (evmax − 1) − C1 exp(C2 ) .

Having established these basic preliminary lemmas, we next derive bounds on T to enforce the sustainability
bounds on v and v̇.

B. Enforcing v(t) ≤ vmax
To enforce v(t) ≤ vmax , we enforce v̇

v=vmax

≤ 0, and the following lemma gives a sufficient condition for

doing so.
Lemma 4: Under Assumption 4, if T satisfies
kT k1 ≤

then v(t) ≤ vmax for all t ∈ [0, tmax ].
Proof: Using Equation (2a), enforcing v̇

v=vmax

≤ 0 is equivalent to requiring −eγ0 (evmax − 1) − 1T w ≤ 0, which

we rearrange to find −1T w ≤ eγ0 (evmax − 1).

We note that −1T w ≤ kwk1 , and we will thus enforce the sufficient condition
kw(t)k1 ≤ eγ0 (evmax − 1)

(3)

for all t. Using Assumption 4, v(0) < vmax . Suppose that v approaches vmax at time t, i.e., v(t) = vmax . Then the
condition v(s) ≤ vmax for all s ∈ [0, t) is satisfied and Lemma 2 can be used at time t. Then a sufficient condition
for enforcing Equation (3) is given by
C1 exp(βkT k1 tmax ) ≤ eγ0 (evmax − 1).
Solving for kT k1 then gives a bound that insures v̇(t)
repeating the above argument at τ insures that v̇(τ )

v=vmax
v=vmax

≤ 0. If v later approaches vmax at some time τ , then
≤ 0 as well. Of course, if v never approaches vmax

then v(t) ≤ vmax trivially holds, and thus it is true for all t ∈ [0, tmax ] in all cases.



C. Enforcing v(t) ≥ vmin
We next derive a sufficient condition on T that implies that the bound v(t) ≥ vmin is satisfied for all t ∈ [0, tmax ].
Lemma 5: If kT k1 satisfies the bound in Lemma 4 and


v(0) − tmax eγ0 (evmax − 1) − vmin

then v(t) ≥ vmin for all t ∈ [0, tmax ].
Proof: The bound from Lemma 4 insures that v(t) ≤ vmax for all t ∈ [0, tmax ] and thus Lemma 3 can be applied.
Using Lemma 3, a sufficient condition for this lemma is to enforce
v(0) − tmax eγ0 (evmax − 1) − tmax C1 exp (C2 ) ≥ vmin .
Rearranging terms and expanding C2 we find
v(0) − tmax eγ0 (evmax − 1) − vmin ≥ tmax C1 exp (βkT k1 tmax ) ,
where solving for kT k1 completes the proof.




With Assumption 4 in place, Lemmas 4 and 5 jointly provide that v(t) ∈ vmin , vmax for all t ∈ [0, tmax ], and

the next two lemmas rely on this point.

D. Enforcing v̇ ≤ dmax
In this section we derive a condition on kT k1 that implies v̇(t) ≤ dmax for all t ∈ [0, tmax ].

v̇ = −eγ0 (ev − 1) − 1T w ≤ −eγ0 (evmin − 1) + kw(t)k1
to derive a sufficient condition. In particular, because T satisfies the bound in Lemma 4 we may apply Lemma 2.
Doing so, we wish to enforce
−eγ0 (evmin − 1) + C1 exp (C2 ) ≤ dmax .
Rearranging we find
C1 exp (βkT k1 tmax ) ≤ dmax + eγ0 (evmin − 1),
where isolating kT k1 completes the proof.

E. Enforcing v̇ ≥ dmin
This section derives a sufficient condition on kT k1 that implies v̇ ≥ dmin for all t ∈ [0, tmax ].

then v̇(t) ≥ dmin for all t ∈ [0, tmax ].
Proof: Using Equation (2a), a sufficient condition for v̇(t) ≥ dmin is dmin ≤ −eγ0 (ev − 1) − 1T w. Rearranging,
we wish to enforce eγ0 (ev − 1) + 1T w ≤ |dmin |, where the absolute value comes from the fact that dmin < 0 in
Assumption 4. A sufficient condition for doing so is eγ0 (ev − 1) + kw(t)k1 ≤ |dmin |. By hypothesis, T satisfies
the bound in Lemma 4 and, as as result, v(t) ≤ vmax for all t ∈ [0, tmax ]. Then we apply Lemma 2 to find the
bound
eγ0 (evmax − 1) + C1 exp (βkT k1 tmax ) ≤ |dmin |.
Solving for kT k1 then gives the result.

F. Overall Sustainability Bound
Enforcing sustainability requires that v(t) ∈ [vmin , vmax ] and that v̇(t) ∈ [dmin , dmax ] for all t ∈ [0, tmax ].
Insuring satisfaction of these conditions can be done by satisfying all four of the preceding bounds on kT k1 .
Combining the four preceding lemmas, we have the following theorem that states a single unified sustainability
criterion.

The condition that ξi > C1 is simply a feasibility condition; if it is violated, then these bounds cannot be used
to insure sustainability because the logarithm will output a negative value. This feasibility condition can be used
to generate conditions that must be satisfied by the parameters vmin , vmax , dmin , dmax , and tmax ; we avoid a
lengthy exposition on this subject because the many parameters in this model generate a vast number of possible
relationships that one could explore. Instead, we comment on one relationship in particular. Elementary operations
show that the condition ξ1 > C1 implies that

sensitivity, captured by bi , when ensuring sustainability. We expand on the relationship between sustainability and
sensitivity in the next section, and we further discuss the implications of sustainability in that context.
VI. S IMULATION AND D ISCUSSION
In this section we explore the implications of the above results for the behavior of social-ecological systems. First,
the behavior of the model is examined under different θ parameters in order to demonstrate the differences between
societies that place more weight on social information and societies that place more weight on ecological information;
these cases will be referred to as pro-social and pro-ecological societies, respectively. We will benchmark these
cases against societies which weight social and ecological information comparably, which we refer to as the equal
case. Second, the sustainability bounds are discussed with respect to the parameter bi , demonstrating how the
sensitivity of populations relates to the sustainability of their consumptions.
A. Pro-Social and Pro-Ecological Communities
The stability proof presented in Theorem 1 depends on Assumption 3, i.e., that θi ≥

ωki θk for all i. If the

collection {θi }i∈{1,...,n} satisfies Assumption 3, then {δθi }i∈{1,...,n} for δ ≥ 0 also does. While the relationship
between the individual θi ’s is fixed by Assumption 3, the scaling factor δ allows a variety of systems to be described
based on a single collection {θi }i∈{1,...,n} that satisfies Assumption 3. With such a collection, and using θi =

to find new sets of admissible parameters. If δ is chosen so that δθi  1, then αi ≈ 0 and νi ≈ 1, which we
refer to as the pro-social condition. If δθi  1, then νi ≈ 0 and αi ≈ 1, which we refer to as the pro-ecological
condition. We refer to the case of αi ≈ νi as the equal condition.
To understand the impact of the relative sizes of αi and νi on system behavior, the system in Equation (2) was simulated on the 25-node randomly generated graph shown in Figure 1. Each edge was given uniform weight. The choice
of θ = [0.1826 0.3296 0.2313 0.3454 0.1987 0.1923 0.1642 0.1989 0.1182 0.2198 0.1124 0.0734 0.1592

respective averages, ᾱ and ν̄, these cases are:
i. The pro-ecological case with δ = 0.1, which gives ᾱ = 0.9822 and ν̄ = 0.0196
ii. The pro-social case with δ = 10, which gives ᾱ = 0.0644 and ν̄ = 0.9356
iii. The equal case with δ = θ̄ = 0.1816, which gives ᾱ = 0.5261 and ν̄ = 0.4739.
The parameters bi and ρi were chosen uniformly at random from [0, 1].
The resource behavior for all three runs is shown in Figure 2 and the individual consumption behavior for all
three runs is shown in Figure 3; each plot is representative of the behavior observed on a variety of graph topologies
over the course of many simulations. We see that both the resource stock and consumption values tend to fluctuate

to varying degrees, depicted by the oscillations in these trajectories. Such oscillations may be undesirable in socialecological systems for a variety of reasons. For instance, it has been observed that grasslands and forests exhibit an
increased tendency to be eradicated by invading plant species in the presence of frequent disturbances and repeated
exposure to extreme environmental conditions [37], [38]. In addition, boom-bust cycles in human-natural systems
may not only lead to undesirable development patterns in the linked communities [39], but also unwanted price
fluctuations by means of substantial supply shocks [40].
Among the three shown simulation runs, Figure 2 shows that the pro-social system exhibits relatively fewer total
oscillations than the other systems, though the magnitude of oscillations is larger. Note that in Figure 2, while
the resource dynamics for the pro-ecological and equal societies display significantly more fluctuations than the
pro-social society, they converge to the equilibrium faster. The notion of speed of convergence, and of return to the
equilibrium, have been previously associated with the concept of resilience, a fundamental attribute of sustainable
systems [7], [41]. We then see from Figure 2 that while the pro-social resource dynamics have desirably fewer
fluctuations, the pro-ecological dynamics have a desirably higher rate of convergence with smaller magnitudes
of oscillations. The situation is reversed if we observe the trajectories of the individual consumptions in Figure 3.
Here, the pro-ecological society exhibits fewer oscillations but with slower convergence, while the pro-social society
exhibits faster convergence but with more oscillations.
There thus exist two trade-offs. The first is between fluctuations and rate of convergence, with faster convergence
coming at the cost of more fluctuations in the resource, and reduced fluctuations coming at the cost of slower
convergence to an equilibrium value. The second tradeoff is between desirable behaviors in the resource and
desirable behaviors in agents’ consumption levels, with reduced fluctuations in each coming at the cost of increased
fluctuations in the other. These tradeoffs suggest that the equal society, which gives a balanced preference to both
ecological and social information, is more favorable than extreme societal configurations that weigh one source
of information much more heavily than the other. From a policy perspective, promoting the equal society would
entail measures that encourage society to give equal consideration to the state of the resource and the behavior
of neighboring agents while determining individual consumptions. Examples of such measures include strategic
information dispersion, targeted advertising, awareness campaigns, and manipulating visibility of key variables [42].
B. System Sensitivity
The conditions required by Theorem 1 did not restrict the parameters {bi }i∈{1,...,n} , which factors out of the
consumption dynamics for ẇ and thus essentially acts as a gain on agents’ responsiveness to network stimuli.
That is, the parameter bi captures agent i’s sensitivity to the social and ecological information they receive.
However, the sustainability bounds derived in Section IV depend upon {bi }i∈{1,...,n} through the parameter β
Pn
and the term i=1 bi αi in the definition of C1 . Furthermore, as discussed previously, for ξ1 > C1 it must hold that
Pn 1

> tmax , implying that agents’ sensitivities affect bounds on the time horizon over which sustainability

can be guaranteed.

16

We consider the implications of this bound in the same 25-node network shown in Figure 1 under the equal
parameter regime. We consider three uniform cases: bi = 0.025, bi = 0.005, or bi = 0.001 for all i, and changing bi
changes the time horizon over which a system can be shown to be sustainable. We consider a time horizon of
tmax = 1 when bi = 0.025, a time horizon of tmax = 2 when bi = 0.005, and a time horizon of tmax = 3 when
bi = 0.001. Note that these times are normalized with respect to the intrinsic growth rate of the resource, and
thus sustainability for tmax = 3 pertains to the system behavior across an interval that is 3 times the intrinsic time
constant of the resource [21].
The bounds in Equation (4) determine sustainability with respect to choices of vmin , vmax , dmin , and dmax ,
which would be determined by the ecological context that is being modeled. For this simulation, we consider the
minimal vmax and dmax as well as the maximal vmin and dmin for which the system is sustainable, which we refer
to as the minimal sustainability window. These values can be derived from elementary operations on the condition
that ξi = ekT k1 βtmax C1 for i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, which follows from attaining equality in the bound in Theorem 2. We
plot the evolution of the resource from t = 0 to t = tmax in Figure 4, where we see that that it indeed remains
within the minimal sustainability window. In Figure 4, as bi decreases the minimal sustainability window more
tightly bounds the resource trajectory, suggesting that the resulting system is sustainable with respect to a larger set
of choices of vmin , vmax , dmin , and dmax . This also suggests that a decrease in agent sensitivity results in longer
time horizons for which the system can be made sustainable.
However, sensitive systems have been observed to be more beneficial in certain settings and with respect to a
particular set of indicators. For instance, Consumer Affect (intensity of reaction to stimuli [43]) has been found to
have a profound effect on achieving sustainable consumer behavior [42]. The ability of agents to adapt quickly to
resource fluctuations has also been found to be an important aspect of sustainable fishing communities [44]. We
find in our model that low sensitivity can indeed be associated with higher fluctuations in the resource.
However, as highlighted in the preceding sections, social-ecological systems are complex in nature, where a
single factor alone cannot be associated with a particular outcome. Instead, system parameters and variables often
act in combination to produce a certain outcome. To further illustrate this point, Figure 5 shows the resource
trajectory for a relatively less-sensitive society. The simulation was run for the same 25-node graph as above, with
bi = 0.005 and for all configurations of information preference used above. The pro-social society has a very large
fluctuation in the quantity of the resource, reaching1 v ≈ −30, which is roughly 6 times the size of fluctuations in
the equal society and nearly 10 times that of the pro-ecological one. This suggests that insufficient weighting of
ecological information and low sensitivity, together, lead to large, potentially harmful fluctuations in the resource.
This point has been observed previously in [45], where more sensitivity to ecological information has been observed
to contribute to adopting more sustainable behavior patterns.
The above suggests another trade-off enacted by varying the sensitivity of the agents. On one hand, higher
sensitivity leads to loose bounds and small time horizons for the sustainability criterion. On the other hand, low
sensitivity leads to larger oscillations in the resource stock (especially in combination with low preference for

ecological information). The model hence suggests, from a policy perspective, controlled measures to vary the
responsiveness of the consuming population. These measures may either be of an informational or structural nature
(see [42] and included references for possible examples of such measures), with the end goal always being improving
sustainability outcomes.
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper we have presented a mathematical criterion for sustainability grounded in the literature on sustainable
development. The presented definition of sustainability extends the notion of stability which is often applied to
ecological systems. While stability pertains to the asymptotic behavior of the system, sustainability concerns itself
with behavior over a finite time horizon where transient behavior often dominates. We find that, in the chosen
model of natural resource consumption, the requirements for sustainability are not captured by stability alone. In
particular, we observe that agent sensitivity, while having no contribution to determining stability, has a major role
in sustainability of the same system. Our simulations of sustainable networks for the model uncover tradeoffs in
system behavior that do not appear when investigating system stability alone. These findings may be translated to

Lemma 9 shows that T T Θ + ΘT is singular. In particular, it has a nullspace of dimension at least 1. In the next
lemma we show that the dimension of its nullspace is exactly 1.
Lemma 10: The matrix T T Θ + ΘT has rank n − 1.
Proof: Strong connectivity, from Assumption 2, makes T irreducible, so that T T is as well. Multiplying T T Θ only
gives positive weights to the entries of T T , and T T Θ is therefore also irreducible. Because all diagonal entries are
positive and all off-diagonal entries are non-positive, the sum T T Θ + ΘT is then irreducible as well. T T Θ + ΘT
is also symmetric, and, by Lemma 8, it is positive semidefinite. By Exercise 4.15 in [47], it is an M -matrix.
Theorem 4.16 in [47] shows that singular, irreducible M -matrices have rank n − 1.

Because T T Θ + ΘT has a one-dimensional nullspace containing 1, we see that

N T T Θ + ΘT = span{1}.
We now proceed with the main stability proof.
Proof of Theorem 1: We use the Lyapunov function
1
V (v, w) = ev − v − 1 + e−γ0 wT (AB)−1 w,
2
where (AB)−1 is well-defined because A and B are diagonal matrices with positive diagonal elements. Differentiating V , we find that
V̇ = ev v̇ − v̇ + ẇT e−γ0 (AB)−1 w
= (ev − 1)(−eγ0 (ev − 1) − 1T w) + eγ0 (ev − 1)1T ABe−γ0 (AB)−1 w − wT T T V Be−γ0 (AB)−1 w,
where we have used that A and B are symmetric. Gathering like terms, we find that
V̇ = −e−γ0 (ev − 1)2 − e−γ0 wT T T V A−1 w.
The first term is manifestly negative for all v 6= 0. For v = 0, one has
V̇ = −e−γ0 wT T T V A−1 w

(6)

= −e−γ0 wT (T T Θ + ΘT )w ≤ 0.
Because T T Θ+ΘT is not full rank, we must apply LaSalle’s invariance principle to show asymptotic convergence.
To do so, we wish to show that the set
S := {(v, w) | V̇ (v, w) ≡ 0}
contains only the trivial trajectory (v, w) ≡ 0. We first note that V̇ = 0 requires v = 0 for all time. Setting v = 0
and v̇ = 0, we use the v dynamics of this system to find
v̇ = 0 = −1T w,
and thus we require

1T w = 0 for w to remain in S, which we write as w(t) ∈ span{1}⊥ for all t. Next, from

Lemma 9, we see that

wT T T Θ + ΘT w = 0
if and only if w is in the nullspace of T T Θ + ΘT . As a result, with v = 0, Equation (6) shows we remain in S if
and only if w(t) ∈ span{1} for all t. Combined with the above, remaining in S requires
w(t) ∈ span{1} ∩ span{1}⊥
for all time, which necessarily implies that w ≡ 0.
