Abstract
In this paper we investigate density conditions for finding a complete
(r)
r-uniform hypergraph Kr+1 on r + 1 vertices in an (r + 1)-partite runiform hypergraph G. First we prove an optimal condition in terms of
the densities of the (r + 1) induced r-partite subgraphs of G. Second, we
prove a version of this result where we assume that r-tuples of vertices
in G have their neighbours evenly distributed in G. Third, we also prove
(r)
a counting result for the minimum number of copies of Kr+1 when G
satisfies our density bound, and present some open problems.
A striking difference between the graph, r = 2, and the hypergraph,
r ≥ 3, cases is that in the first case both the existence threshold and
the counting function are non-linear in the involved densities, whereas
for hypergraphs they are given by a linear function. Also, the smallest
density of the r-partite parts needed to ensure the existence of a complete
r-graph with (r + 1) vertices is equal to the golden ratio τ = 0.618 . . . for
r
r = 2, while it is r+1
for r ≥ 3.

Introduction

One of the classical problems in extremal graph theory is that of finding the
maximum density of a graph G which does not contain some fixed graph H.
This density is known as the Turán density for H and is defined as π(H) =
limn→∞ ex(n,H)
, where the Turán number ex(n, H) is the maximum number of
(n2 )
edges in a graph on n vertices which does not have H as a subgraph. Mantel
proved that π(K3 ) = 21 and later Turán gave a complete answer for H = Kt
[Tur41].
Motivated by a question of Erdős regarding the maximum density of a triangle free subgraph of a graph [BSTT06] investigated a modified version of the
Turán density, namely that of finding the maximum density of a 3-partite graph
which does not contain a K3 . The problem was given a complete solution in
terms of the three bipartite graphs induced by each pair of vertex classes of
the 3-partition. Later [BJT10] investigated the number of K3 s as a function of

these densities, and a sharp result was given for large enough densities. Enumeration of triangles in general graphs has a long history and was finally solved
by Razborov [Raz08].
Our aim in this paper is to investigate generalisations of these questions to
uniform hypergraphs. In particular we will determine the maximal density of
an (r + 1)-partite r-uniform hypergraph which does not contain the complete
r
hypergraph Kr+1
. We will also present a sharp bound on the number of copies
r
of Kr+1 . These results demonstrate a qualitative difference between graphs
and hypergraphs with r ≥ 3, where interestingly enough the extension to the
hypergraph case is less complex than the graph case. The existence condition
found in [BSTT06] for graphs is non-linear in terms of the involved densities, as
are the counting results from [BJT10], but as our results show the corresponding
condition, and counting function, for r ≥ 3 are given by simple linear functions.
For hypergraphs far less is known in the non-partite case than for graphs.
Turán conjectured that π(K43 ) = 95 , and gave a matching construction for the
lower bound. Using flag-algebra Razborov [Raz10] has proven that π(K43 ) ≤
0.56167. For r = 4 Giraud [Gir90] gave a construction which shows that
11
, and Sidorenko [Sid95] conjectured that this is in fact the corπ(K54 ) ≥ 16
rect value. The best current upper bound π(K54 ) ≤ 1753
2380 was given by the first
author in [Mar09]. For r ≥ 5 much less is known. De Caen [dC83] proved that
r
π(Kr+1
) ≤ (1 − 1r ), and this was later sharpened somewhat for odd r in [CL99]
and even r in [LZ09]. As a corollary to one of our results we will get a short
proof of de Caen’s bound.

3-graph G such that K43 6⊂ G. and proved the sharp result |E(G)| ≤ 17

One of the few counting results for hypergraphs is by Mubayi [Mub13] who
used the hypergraph removal lemma [Gow07, NRS06, RS06, Tao06] to prove
lower bounds on the number of copies of H in a hypergraph with ex(n, H) +
q edges. These bounds apply to certain forbidden hypergraphs H with the
property that there is a unique H-free hypergraph on ex(n, H) edges, and the
bounds are of the form qc(n, H), where c(n, H) is the minimum number of copies
of H in any n-vertex r-graph on ex(n, H) + 1 edges.

1.1

Definitions

For r ≥ 2 we will refer to an r-uniform hypergraph as an r-graph. An r-graph
G is t-partite if its vertex has a partition in vertex classes V1 , . . . , Vt , such that
each edge has at most one vertex in any class Vi .
Definition 1.1. Given a t-partite r-graph G with vertex classes V1 , . . . , Vt and
a set of indices I we let PI denote the (t − |I|)-partite r-graph induced by the
classes with indices not in I. If I = {i} then we abbreviate this as Pi
As in [BSTT06] and [BJT10] we are going to work with vertex weighted
r-graphs. We assume that G has a weight-function
w defined on its vertices.
P
The weight of a set S of vertices is w(S) = v∈S w(v).
Qr
We define the weight of an edge e = {v1 , . . . , vr } to be the product i=1 w(vi ),
and the weight of a set of edges as the sum of their weights.
An unweighted r-graph will here be seen as the same graph with a weight
function w(v) = 1 for all vertices v.

Definition 1.2. Given an (r + 1)-partite r-graph G we let ρ(i) be the density
i ))
, and ρ is the vector of
of the r-partite graph induced by Pi , which is Qw(E(P
j6=i w(Vj )
these densities.

We define the minimum density of Kr+1
s as

C(ρ) = inf C(G),

where the infimum is taken over all (r + 1)-partite r-graphs with density ρ.
We will need the following polynomial from [BJT10].
Definition 2.2. ∆(a, b, c) = a2 + b2 + c2 − 2ab − 2ac − 2bc + 4abc
The proof of the following lemma is a routine, but somewhat lengthy, calculus
exercise.
Lemma 2.3. If a, b, c are real numbers in the interval [0, 1] and a + b + c ≥
then ∆(a, b, c) ≥ 0, and ab + c > 1, ac + b > 1, and bc + a > 1.
In particular if each if each of a, b and c is at least
The following theorem was proven in [BJT10].

then ∆(a, b, c) ≥ 0.

Theorem 2.4. The minimum density of triangles in a tripartite graph with
edge densities given by (a, b, c) such that ∆(a, b, c) ≥ 0, ab + c > 1, ac + b > 1,
and bc + a > 1, is given by a + b + c − 2.
We will fist extend the lower bound given by this theorem to larger values
of r.
Lemma 2.5. If ρ is a vector with rational numbers between 0 and 1, such that
r+1
X

ρ(i) − r ≥ 0

i=1

then there exists a weighted (r + 1)-partite r-graph G with rational weights such
Pr+1
that ρ is the density vector of G and C(G) = i=1 ρ(i) − r.
3

Proof. We will prove the statement by induction on r. For r = 2 the statement
is true by Theorem 2.4 of [BJT10], which is also Theorem 2.4 in the present
paper. By that theorem there is an optimal graph which is a weighted 3-partite
graph on six vertices whose 3-partite complement is a perfect matching. Hence
we only need to prove the statement for r ≥ 3.
Without loss of generality we assume that ρ(i) ≥ ρ(i + 1) for 1 ≤ i ≤ r and
3r
≥ 94 . Thus, by Lemma 2.3,
hence, by averaging, that ρ(1) + ρ(2) + ρ(3) ≥ r+1
we know that the conditions of Theorem 2.4 are satisfied by these three values.
We now assume that the statement is true for r − 1. In order to build an
r-graph H2 which satisfies the statement in the Lemma we take an r-partite
(r − 1)-graph H1 , with the first r parts of ρ as its density vector, which satisfies
the statement for r − 1, and build an (r + 1)-partite r-graph H2 by adding one
new class Vr+1 which contains a single vertex v, with weight 1.
For every edge e in H1 we let e ∪ {v} be an edge of H2 . This means that
for i 6= r + 1 the density contributed to ρ(i) by these edges will be the same as
in H1 . Hence H2 has the desired density ρ(i) for these classes, and the edges
r
added so far do not give rise to a Kr+1
.
We will now add edges among the first r classes. One of these edges will be
(r−1)
part of a weighted Kr+1 in H2 if the corresponding r-tuple in H1 is a Kr
in
(r−1)
H1 , and by induction we know the density of such Kr
.
As pointed out in [BJT10] we may assume that H1 is in fact a simple unweighted hypergraph, since a hypergraph with rational weights can be modified
by a suitable blow-up into an equivalent unweighted hypergraph on a larger
number of vertices.
(r−1)

PrIn H1 the density of partite r-tuples which do not span a Kr
( i=1 ρ(i) − (r − 1)), and all these tuples can be added as edges without creatr
ing a Kr+1
in H2 . Each additional edge added after these form a unique Kr+1r
together with the vertex in Vr+1 , so if we add enough edges to reach the desired
density ρ(r + 1) we will have

r
r

is not stable.
Byt the existing results for r = 2 we know that there is not a unique graph which
minimizes the number of triangles and Lemma 2.5 gives distinct extensions to
higher values of r.

Balanced Codegrees

Our second result concerns degrees rather than densities, and for r-graph we
have found it natural to consider the degrees of the (r − 1)-tuples of vertices in
G.
Definition 3.1. Given a multipartite r-graph G, with V (G) partitioned into
at least r classes, we say that a t-tuple g of vertices from G is partite if it has
at most one vertex in each class of G.
Definition 3.2. Given a partite t-tuple g we say that an (r − t)-tuple h is
completing g if (g ∪ h) ∈ E(G). We call the set of completing (r − t)-tuples for
g the neighbourhood N (g) of g. The neighbourhood of g in a set I of classes is
the set of completing (r − t)-tuples in I, and is denoted N (I, g)
The degree of g is d(g) = |N (g)| and the degree in an (r − t)-tuple I of
classes is d(I, g) = |N (I, g)|.
By the minimum codegree of an (multipartite) r-graph G we refer to the
minimum degree of all (partite) (r − 1)-tuples of vertices in V (G)
Definition 3.3. We say that a partite t-tuple g of vertices in G has strictly
balanced degree if it has the same number of completing (r − t)-tuples in each
of the (r − t)-tuples of classes which g does not intersect.

⊂ G.
and maxj i6=j ρ(i) > (r − 1) then Kr+1

Note that the condition on the partite (r − 1)-tuples means that such a tuple
splits its neighbourhood equally between each of the two parts which the tuple
does not intersect, but the sizes of those neighbourhoods may differ between
different tuples.
5

Proof. We will first look at the case j = 1. Let e be an edge of P1 and let
g2 , . . . , gr+1 be the (r − 1)-tuples which are subsets of e. If G does not contain
r
Kr+1
we must have that
S(e) =

r+1
X

d(V1 , gi ) ≤ (r − 1),

i=2

since otherwise there would be a common vertex in the neighbourhoods of the
r
(r − 1)-tuples, and we would have a Kr+1
.
If we sum over all edges in P1 we find that

The results follows for other values of j in the same way.
As shown in [BSTT06] this result is sharp for r = 2, but we do not have a
matching lower bound for larger r.
Relating to the case where all densities are equal we get the following

This can be compared to the minimum codegree which forces a Kr+1
in the
non-partite case. In [LM14] it was proven that there are r-graph with minimum
r
(r − 1)-degree 12 (n − 2) which do not contain a Kr+1
, and it was conjectured
that this is an optimal bound. This in turn implies that the global density is at
least 21 .
Another simple corollary of this result is de Caen’s upper bound on the
r
Turán-density of Kr+1
.
r

Corollary 3.6 (de Caen [dC83]). If G is an r-graph and |E(G)| > (1 − 1r ) nr!
r
then Kr+1
⊂ G.

Proof. Given a labelled r-graph G with vertex set V we will form a new (r + 1)partite r-graph H. The vertex set of H is the disjoint union of r + 1 copies
V1 , . . . , Vr+1 of V .
Given an edge e = {v1 , v2 , ..., vr } of G, a choice of r of the classes Vi , and a
permutation π ∈ Sr , we let eπ = {vπ(1) , vπ(2) , . . . , vπ(r) ), where the jth vertex
in the tuple is the vertex in the jth of the r vertex classes, be an edge in the
r-partite subgraph of H induced by those classes. Note that in this way each
edge e of G gives rise to r! edges in each of the r-partite subgraphs of H. (So
if we look at ordinary graphs and let G be a single edge (1,2) then H would
become a 6-cycle which winds twice through the three parts.)
The r-graph H has strictly balanced codegrees, since the number of neighbours in Vi , of a partite (r−1)-tuple t in H, only depends on whether t intersects
Vi or not, and the number of neighbours of t in G.
By the assumptions each ρ(i) in H is strictly greater than (1 − r1 ), so H
r
r
contains a copy of Kr+1
, and the corresponding vertices form a Kr+1
in G.
In fact the proof of Theorem 3.4 can easily be modified to give a bound
r
for the degree required to give a copy of (Kr+1
− k), the r-graph obtained by
r
deleting any k edges from Kr+1
, we just need to modify the first bound for S(e)
to be less than r − k − 1. This gives
Theorem 3.7. If thePpartite (r − 1)-tuples of G have strictly balanced degrees,
r
k ≤ r − 1, and maxj i6=j ρ(i) > r − k − 1 then (Kr+1
− k) ⊂ G.

r
For k ≥ r − 1 the graph (Kr+1
− k) is in fact r-partite, and the strictly
balanced degree condition means that if G has at least one edge then any edge
r
will be part of a (Kr+1
− (r − 1)), which is simply two edges overlapping on an
(r − 1)-tuple.
Using this theorem as in the proofs of Corollaries 3.5 and 3.6 we get

Corollary 3.8. If all partite (r−1)-tuples of G have balanced degree, k ≤ (r−1),
r
and ρ(i) > 1 − k+1
r for all i then (Kr+1 − k) ⊂ G.

n
Corollary 3.9. If G is an r-graph, k ≤ (r − 1), and |E(G)| > (1 − k+1
r ) r! then
r
(Kr+1 − k) ⊂ G.

The case r = 3 of the latter result was proven by de Caen in [dC83].

Open problems

Following [BSTT06] and the results in this paper concerning the codegree it is
natural to ask what happens for general degrees in r-graphs with r > 2. The
first open case is vertex degrees for 3-graphs
Question 4.1. Let G be a 4-partite 3-graph with balanced vertex degrees. Which
densities force a K43 in G?
For r > 3 the corresponding question is open for balanced l-degrees for all
l < r − 1.
Question 4.2. Let G be an r-partite r-graph with 4 ≤ r. Which densities forces
a Kr+1 if the partite l-tuples have balanced degrees, where 1 ≤ l < r − 1.
Let G be a t-partite r-graph with all densities at least α. Given an r-graph
H, we can ask for the minimum density α which forces a copy of H in G. We
call this density dt (H).
Question 4.3. Does there exist a finite t0 such that dt (H) = dt0 (H) for t ≥ t0 ?
For r = 2 and H = Kt the answer is yes by [Pfe12].
