ABSTRACT

Giant outbursts of Be/X-ray binaries may occur when a Be–star disc undergoes strong eccentricity growth due to the Kozai–Lidov (KL) mechanism. The KL effect acts on a disc
that is highly inclined to the binary orbital plane provided that the disc aspect ratio is sufficiently small. The eccentric disc overflows its Roche lobe and material flows from the Be
star disc over to the companion neutron star causing X-ray activity. With N–body simulations and steady state decretion disc models we explore system parameters for which a disc
in the Be/X-ray binary 4U 0115+634 is KL unstable and the resulting timescale for the oscillations. We find good agreement between predictions of the model and the observed giant
outburst timescale provided that the disc is not completely destroyed by the outburst. This allows the outer disc to be replenished between outbursts and a sufficiently short KL oscillation
timescale. An initially eccentric disc has a shorter KL oscillation timescale compared to an
initially circular orbit disc. We suggest that the chaotic nature of the outbursts is caused by
the sensitivity of the mechanism to the distribution of material within the disc. The outbursts
continue provided that the Be star supplies material that is sufficiently misaligned to the binary orbital plane. We generalise our results to Be/X-ray binaries with varying orbital period
and find that if the Be star disc is flared, it is more likely to be unstable to KL oscillations in
a smaller orbital period binary, in agreement with observations.

1 INTRODUCTION
Be stars are rapidly rotating early type stars with a viscous thin,
Keplerian disc (Lee, Osaki & Saio 1991; Porter 1996; Hanuschik
1996; Hummel 1998; Quirrenbach et al. 1997; Porter & Rivinius
2003; Rivinius, Carciofi & Martayan 2013; Okazaki 2016). Material is added to the inner parts of the disc from the Be star
(Cassinelli et al. 2002) and thus the disc is a decretion disc, rather
than an accretion disc (Pringle 1991). The stellar material spirals outwards through the disc due to the action of viscosity
that is thought to be driven by the magnetorotational instability
(Balbus & Hawley 1991).
Be/X-ray binaries typically consist of a Be star and a neutron
star in an eccentric orbit binary. The orbit became eccentric, and
most likely inclined with respect to the spin of the Be star, when
the neutron star formed in a supernova explosion. A slight asymmetry to the explosion caused a kick on the newly formed neutron
star (Brandt & Podsiadlowski 1995; Martin, Tout & Pringle 2009).
The tidal torque exerted by the neutron star companion truncates
the Be star disc (Okazaki et al. 2002; Hayasaki & Okazaki 2004;
Reig 2007). This is observationally confirmed since the disc is more

dense when the Be star has a binary companion (Zamanov et al.
2001; Cyr et al. 2017).
Some Be/X-ray binaries are transient systems, meaning that
they alternate between long quiescent periods and short outbursts,
while others are persistent X-ray sources (Okazaki et al. 2002).
There are two types of X-ray outbursts that occur through accretion on to the neutron star (e.g. Kuehnel et al. 2015). Type I
X-ray outbursts in an eccentric orbit binary occur each orbital
period when the neutron star is at periastron and able to capture material from the Be star disc (Okazaki & Negueruela 2001;
Negueruela et al. 2001; Okazaki, Hayasaki & Moritani 2013). In
a low eccentricity binary, type I outbursts may be driven by
a disc that becomes eccentric through mean motion resonances
with the binary (Franchini & Martin 2019). Type II (or giant)
outbursts are much brighter, last for longer and occur less
frequently (Stella, White & Rosner 1986; Negueruela et al. 1998;
Kretschmar et al. 2013; Cheng, Shao & Li 2014; Monageng et al.
2017).
In this work we focus on the giant outbursts and
in particular the Be/X-ray binary 4U 0115+634. This object is one of the first discovered (Giacconi et al. 1972;
Whitlock, Roussel-Dupre & Priedhorsky 1989) and best-studied
Be X-ray binaries (e.g. Campana 1996; Negueruela et al. 1997).

This a classical system with well constrained orbital parameters
on which many models for the behaviour of Be X-ray binaries are
based (e.g. Negueruela & Okazaki 2001; Okazaki & Negueruela
2001).
Giant outbursts in this system have been associated with
the presence of a tilted disc around the Be star (Reig et al.
2007; Moritani et al. 2011; Martin et al. 2011; Moritani et al. 2013;
Kato 2014). The observed timescale between giant outbursts
is around 3 yr (Whitlock, Roussel-Dupre & Priedhorsky 1989;
Negueruela et al. 2001; Reig et al. 2007; Reig & Blinov 2018).
However, sometimes these outbursts are separated by only 1-1.5 yr,
and in this case the second outburst is of lower luminosity than the
first (e.g. Rouco Escorial et al. 2017, 2019). After major outbursts
a decrease in the size of the Be star disc is observed (Reig et al.
2007, 2016).
A sufficiently misaligned disc around a Be star can become
highly eccentric (Martin et al. 2014a). This is a result of Kozai–
Lidov oscillations that exchange inclination and eccentricity of
a misaligned orbit around one component of a binary (Kozai
1962; Lidov 1962). In a fluid disc, if the radial sound crossing
timescale is shorter than the period of the KL oscillations then
the disc can undergo global KL oscillations (Martin et al. 2014b;
Fu, Lubow & Martin 2015a,b, 2017). The eccentricity growth
causes the disc to overflow its Roche lobe and transfer material
to the companion neutron star (Franchini, Martin & Lubow 2019).
This may be the mechanism behind type II X-ray outbursts observed in Be/X-ray binaries.
In this work we consider the frequency of type II outbursts
as a result of KL oscillations of the Be star disc. In Section 2 we
first consider the timescale for KL oscillations of a test particle orbit around the Be star in the binary 4U 0115+634. In Section 3
we explore the KL oscillation timescale for a steady state Be star
decretion disc around the Be star in the binary 4U 0115+634. We
examine parameters for which the disc is KL unstable and find that
our model agrees well with the numerical simulation presented in
Martin et al. (2014a). The advantage of our analytic approach is
that we can examine a large parameter space. In Section 4 we generalise our results to a wider range of parameters and show that
giant outbursts driven by KL oscillations are more likely to occur
for smaller orbital period binaries. In Section 5 we discuss the implications of our results and we draw our conclusions in Section 6.

2 KL OSCILLATION TIMESCALE FOR A PARTICLE
ORBIT
We consider a binary
p with components of mass M1 and M2 , orbital
period Porb = 2π/ G(M1 + M2 )/a3 , (where G is the gravitational
constant), semi–major axis, a, and orbital eccentricity eb . The KL
effect causes oscillations of the inclination, i, and eccentricity, e, of
a misaligned test particle around one component of a binary system
(Kozai 1962; Lidov 1962). For an initially circular test particle orbit
around one component of a circular orbit binary, oscillations occur
when the initial inclination satisfies 39◦ . i . 141◦ . During the oscillations, the component of the angular momentum of the particle
that is perpendicular to the binary orbital plane is conserved so that

where Pp = 2π/ GM1 /R3 is the orbital period of the particle that
orbits around the Be star with semi-major axis R. We consider here
first how properties of the binary orbit might change the KL oscillation timescale and then how properties of the particle orbit change
the timescale.

2.1 Binary parameters
We consider a Be star binary model based on the parameters of
4U 0115+634. For our standard model we follow Negueruela et al.
(2001) and take the Be star to have a mass M1 = 18 M⊙ and
radius R1 = 8 R⊙ (Vacca, Garmany & Shull 1996). The neutron
star companion has a mass M2 = 1.4 M⊙ and is at an orbital
semi–major axis of a = 95 R⊙ with orbital eccentricity e = 0.34
(Rappaport et al. 1978). The orbital period is Porb = 24.3 day. The
errors in the orbital properties of 4U 0115+634 are very small.
The orbital eccentricity is 0.3402 ± 0.0004 and the orbital period
Porb = 24.309 ± 0.021 day (Rappaport et al. 1978). The masses
we take for each component in our model are on the low end
of the possible ranges. The mass of the Be star is determined
through its spectral type (B0.2Ve) and could be up to about 19.5 M⊙
(Vacca, Garmany & Shull 1996). The mass of a neutron star is in
the range 1.1 − 2.1 M⊙ (e.g. Özel et al. 2012).
Fig. 1 shows the change in the KL oscillation timescale (calculated with equation (2), for fixed binary orbital period and for a
particle of fixed semi–major axis) as a function of the neutron star
mass. The two lines show different Be star masses, M1 = 18 M⊙
(solid line) and M1 = 19.5 M⊙ (dashed line). The possible error
in the Be star mass does not significantly affect the KL oscillation
timescale. However, the error in the unknown mass of the neutron
star could lead to a decrease in the KL oscillation timescale of up
to a maximum of about 30%. We discuss this further in Section 3.3.

oscillation eccentricity peak for the analytic prediction (equation 2). The points show the time of the first peak as a function of test particle semi–major axis
for simulations that are initially misaligned by 50◦ with φ = 90◦ . The blue points are initially circular test particle orbits, the purple points have initial particle
eccentricity ep = 0.2 and the red points have ep = 0.4.

2.2 Test particle orbital parameters
We consider here test particle orbits around the Be star with varying
orbital properties. The left hand panel of Fig. 2 shows test particle
orbits around the Be star initially inclined by 50◦ and starting at different orbital separations. The binary orbits in the x − y plane and
begins at periastron along the x axis. Since the particle is massless
the binary orbit remains fixed. The direction of the angular momentum of the particle is given by the unit vector l = (lx , ly , lz ) and its
phase angle is defined as

(3)

The initial phase angle is φ = 90◦ . Particles closer to the Be
star have a longer KL oscillation timescale, as predicted by equation (2). The farther out a particle is, the more chaotic its evolution.
A particle that begins at a separation of 40 R⊙ is ejected from the
system. The right hand panel of Fig. 2 shows the analytic prediction
for the time of the first peak eccentricity given in equation (2). The
blue points show the results of test particle simulations with an initially circular orbit inclined by i = 50◦ with φ = 90◦ . We note that
the oscillation timescale is not uniform because of the eccentricity
of the binary (e.g. Naoz et al. 2013). Also, the orbits we consider
are not in the hierarchical triple body limit in which the separation
of the particle from the Be star is much smaller than the separation
of the binary.
An initially eccentric particle orbit has a shorter KL oscillation timescale (Franchini, Martin & Lubow 2019). In the right hand
panel of Fig. 2, the purple points show particles with initial eccentricity ep = 0.2 and the red points with ep = 0.4. The initial inclination is again 50◦ , the phase angle is φ = 90◦ and the argument of
periapsis is 180◦ . For small separation, the KL oscillation timescale
c 2019 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–9

is a factor of 4.1 shorter for an initial eccentricity of 0.4 and a factor
of 2.7 shorter for initial eccentricity of 0.2.
Fig. 3 shows test particle simulations that begin at different
nodal phases, φ = 0◦ and φ = 90◦ for two different initial inclinations. These show that the time to the first peak is relatively insensitive to the initial inclination or the nodal phase angle. We also
found that the KL oscillation timescale is rather insensitive to the
initial argument of periapsis. The parameters that the timescale is
most sensitive to are the semi–major axis of the particle and the
initial eccentricity of the particle orbit.
For a circular orbit disc composed of test particles, each particle undergoes KL oscillations and nodal precession on a timescale
that most strongly depends on its separation from the Be star.
The disc of particles forms a thick structure or swarm on a short
timescale. However, the pressure in a hydrodynamical gaseous disc
connects different orbital radii of the disc together allowing it to
undergo global KL oscillations. The decretion disc can extend to
larger radii than those of stable test particle orbits. The timescale of
the oscillations depends upon the distribution of material within the
disc. In the next Section we explore the KL oscillation timescale for
a gas disc.

3 DECRETION DISC MODEL
In this Section we first consider the Be star decretion disc temperature structure and the surface density profile. We focus on the orbital parameters of the Be/X-ray binary 4U 0115+634. We estimate
the global KL oscillation timescale for a Be star decretion disc as a
means to calculate the frequency of type II X-ray outbursts. As the
disc undergoes a KL oscillation, it becomes very eccentric. However, the inner parts of the disc continue to accrete circular orbit

R0 = 50 R⊙ . Fig. 8 shows the disc aspect ratio for three values for
the power index, s = 0 (a constant disc aspect ratio), s = 0.25 and
s = 0.5 (an isothermal disc).
Observationally, the disc aspect ratios of Be stars discs are not
well constrained. Wood, Bjorkman & Bjorkman (1997) found the
aspect ratio at the inner edge of ζ Tauri to be 0.04 while other estimates suggest the disc aspect ratio may be much larger farther out
in the disc (e.g Porter 1996; Quirrenbach et al. 1997). Hanuschik
(1996) found that the disc flares at large radii. Negueruela et al.
(2001) modelled the inner disc edge to be 0.026 for 4U 0115+634.
Due to these uncertainties we have chosen to parameterise our models by the disc aspect ratio at the outer edge since this is more important for the dynamical evolution of the disc. Given the uncertainty in the disc aspect ratio, we consider two different values of
(H/R)0 = 0.1 and (H/R)0 = 0.06.

material from the star. The interaction of the circular orbit material
being added to an eccentric disc is beyond the scope of this work
but will be investigated in the future. Here, we consider a steady
state decretion disc model for the Be star disc. This represents the
quasi–steady state disc that is truncated by the tidal torque from the
companion neutron star.

3.1 Disc temperature structure
The material in p
the disc orbits the Be star at Keplerian angular
frequency Ω = GM1 /R3 . The disc extends from the stellar radius, Rin = 8 R⊙ , up to Rt . The outer radius of the disc, Rt , is
determined by where the disc is tidally truncated by the companion neutron star. The outer edge of the disc for 4U 0115+634 in
the smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations of Martin et al.
(2014a) is Rt ≈ 50 R⊙ . The viscosity of the disc is given by

where H is the disc scale height and α is the Shakura & Sunyaev

likely around 0.3 (Jones, Sigut & Porter 2008; Carciofi et al. 2012;
Ghoreyshi & Carciofi 2017; Rı́mulo et al. 2018). This is typical for
a fully ionised accretion disc in which the viscosity is driven by the
magneto–rotational instability (Martin et al. 2019). We assume that

The KL oscillation of a disc may be suppressed if the value for H/R

(Lubow & Ogilvie 2017), where M = M1 + M2 is the total mass of
the binary. For a radius of R = 50 R⊙ , we find (H/R)crit = 0.11. For
the parameters of 4U 0115+634, we plot the critical aspect ratio as
a function of radius in the solid red line in Fig. 4. Since the disc
models we consider all have smaller disc aspect ratio in the outer
parts of the disc, they are unstable to KL disc oscillations.
The critical disc aspect ratio estimate for the KL mechanism to
operate is in agreement with simulations of isothermal discs published in Martin et al. (2014a). We found that the KL mechanism
did not operate for H/R(Rin ) = 0.04, but operated for smaller values
considered. This corresponds to disc aspect ratio at the outer edge
of about H/R(R = 50 R⊙ ) = 0.1. Thus the numerical simulations
are in good agreement with the analytic estimate in equation (6).
The two isothermal disc models shown in Fig. 4 (solid blue and
black lines) both have H/R(Rin ) < 0.04.
3.1.2 Disc viscous timescale
The viscous timescale at the outer edge of the disc is defined as
τν = R2t /ν, where Rt is the outer truncation radius for the disc. For
typical parameters this is given by

Fig. 5 shows the viscous timescale as a function of radius for varying s. Since the outer parts of the disc are depleted during the outburst, material needs to spread outwards on a timescale shorter than
the type II outburst timescale. This requires the disc aspect ratio at
the outer disc edge to be H/R & 0.06.
We have constrained the disc aspect ratio at the outer edge of
the disc to be in the range 0.06 . H/R . 0.11. Even the shortest
possible viscous timescale (for small outer truncation radius and
(H/R)0 = 0.1) is only about a factor of 1.5 − 3 times smaller than
the outburst frequency. Thus, we suggest that the disc cannot be
completely depleted during an outburst in order to have such frequent outbursts.

3.2 Surface density of the disc

Figure 4. The disc aspect ratio as a function of radius for s = 0.5 (solid
lines), s = 0.25 (dashed lines) and s = 0 (dotted lines). The blue (upper)
lines have (H/R)0 = 0.08 and the black (lower) lines have (H/R)0 = 0.06
with R0 = 50 R⊙ . The solid red line shows the critical value of the disc aspect ratio in the outer parts of the disc below which the disc is KL unstable,
(H/R)crit (equation 6).

For a circular orbit binary, test particle orbits cross at a distance
of about 0.48 a = 45.6 R⊙ (Paczynski 1977) and this corresponds
to the maximum radius at which a cold disc can exist. However
a Be star disc may extend to larger radii than this as it is stabilised by pressure effects within it. The eccentricity of the binary
orbit works in the opposite direction and leads to a smaller disc
(Artymowicz & Lubow 1994). However, an inclined disc feels a
weaker binary torque than a coplanar disc and thus may be larger
(Lubow, Martin & Nixon 2015). Hydrodynamical simulations of
such a disc find that the tidal truncation radius varies in time, but for
a disc that is initially misaligned by 70◦ , it is typically around 50 R⊙
(Martin et al. 2014a). The tidal torque increases very strongly with
radius (e.g. Papaloizou & Pringle 1977; Martin & Lubow 2011)
and the surface density profile is sharply truncated at the outer disc
edge.
In this work, we do not explicitly include the tidal torque from
the neutron star that truncates the outer edge of the disc but the
surface density profile is truncated at radius Rt . For the Be star decretion disc the steady state surface density is
!−n+s+1
R
Σ = Σ0
(8)
Rin
for Rin < R < Rt , where Σ0 is a constant that is determined by
the total mass of the disc and n is a constant. We chose this power
law so that the density scales as ρ ∝ Σ/H ∝ R−n . The value for
Σ0 changes in time depending on the total mass of the disc (e.g.
Bjorkman & Carciofi 2005; Carciofi et al. 2006). The amount of
mass contained in the disc depends upon the accretion rate of material from the Be star to the disc and the mass loss rate from the disc.
Since the disc KL oscillation timescale does not depend upon the
total mass of the disc, but rather the distribution of mass, we do not
make any assumption on the absolute value of the surface density
of the disc.
The surface density of a steady state decretion disc satisfies
νΣ ∝ R−1/2 (e.g. Pringle 1981; Martin et al. 2011). For the disc to
be steady we require the power law indices to be related by
n = 3s + 2

(9)

The more strongly flared the disc vertical structure, the sharper the
drop off with radius in the surface density profile of the steady state
disc.
Observationally, in the inner parts of Be star discs, the density
at the midplane scales as ρ ∝ R−n where n is in the range 2 − 3.5
for an isothermal disc (e.g. Cote & Waters 1987; Porter 1999). The
sound speed is cs = HΩ and thus an isothermal disc has H/R ∝
R1/2 , or s = 0.5. With equation (9), the steady state isothermal disc
has n = 3.5, in agreement with the observations.
3.3 KL oscillation timescale

lines have (H/R)0 = 0.06 with R0 = 50 R⊙ .

If the KL disc mechanism drives giant outbursts, then the KL oscillation timescale for the disc corresponds to the timescale between
subsequent type II outbursts. For an initially circular test particle
orbit, the eccentricity may go to zero between oscillations. However, because of dissipation within the disc, the eccentricity oscillation is damped and does not go all the way back to zero. Thus,
if there is significant remaining material in the disc after an outburst, it may have high eccentricity without filling the Roche lobe
and transferring to the neutron star. The KL oscillation timescale
is shorter for test particles that start on an already eccentric orbit

(see Figure 2). Thus, the KL oscillation timescale estimates in this
Section are upper limits to the predicted timescale between type II
outbursts.

(Martin et al. 2014b). The total mass of the disc does not affect the
timescale for KL oscillations. The KL oscillation timescale is sensitive to the size of the disc and the distribution of material within
it. We consider the steady state Be star disc surface density solution
given in equations (8) and (9).
Fig. 6 shows the KL oscillation timescale for varying disc
outer radius for different values of the disc aspect ratio power law,
s. Note that the timescale does not depend on the scaling of the
disc aspect ratio, (H/R)0 , only the power law, s. The larger the disc
outer radius, the shorter the timescale. This is because closer to the
neutron star perturber, the KL oscillation timescale is shorter (see
equation (2)). The timescale is relatively insensitive to the value of
s, but the smaller its value, the more mass that is located farther out
in the disc and thus the shorter the oscillation timescale.
The observed timescale between two subsequent type II outbursts is around 3 yr. The KL oscillation timescales predicted by
the initially circular orbit disc model are longer than the observed
outburst timescales except for very large truncation radius and for
a constant disc aspect ratio (s = 0). We note that the error in the
masses of the binary components may lead to a decrease of a few
tens of percent in the timescale (see Section 2.1). This is not sufficient to explain this discrepancy. However, we showed in Section 2.2 that the KL oscillation timescale may be up to a factor of
a few shorter for an initially eccentric disc. Thus, in order to reproduce the timescale between two subsequent type II outbursts, there
must be eccentric orbit material left in the disc after the outburst.
This is in agreement with our finding in Section 3.1 that the disc
cannot be completely destroyed during the outburst as the viscous
timescale in the disc is long.
The isothermal (s = 0.5) 3D hydrodynamical simulation described in Martin et al. (2014a) had a peak eccentricity at a time
of about 22 Porb ≈ 1.5 yr. Since this is half of the KL oscillation
timescale, hτKL i /2, this appears to be consistent with the recurring
type II outburst timescale observed, despite the fact that the disc
was initially circular. However, the disc was able to undergo the
first KL oscillation on an artificially short timescale due to the initial surface density profile which had Σ ∝ R−1 . Since there is no
source of mass in the disc simulation, the surface density evolves
towards a steady state accretion disc with νΣ=const which gives
Σ ∝ R−3/2 for an isothermal accretion disc. The isothermal decretion discs described in this work have Σ ∝ R−2 . Thus, the initial disc
set up had artificially too much mass in the outer parts of the disc
and this led to a shorter KL oscillation timescale. A second outburst
was not seen in the simulation because there was no material added
at the disc inner edge and the resolution of the disc became too poor
after the first outburst. In the future we will model the evolution of
a disc that includes the accretion of material at the inner edge from
the star. Three dimensional simulations would take into account
not only the surface density evolution, but non–axisymmetric spiral arms (e.g. Panoglou et al. 2018, 2019) that cannot be included
into our one–dimensional approach. However, the advantage of our
analytic model is that we can explore a wide range of parameters.

decretion disc with surface density distributed as equation (8) between the

Simulations of accretion discs undergoing KL oscillations
previously have shown damped oscillations that decay in time.
The inclination of the disc gradually decreases until the inclination is below the critical KL angle (e.g. Martin et al. 2014b;
Fu, Lubow & Martin 2015a,b). However these simulations did not
have any source of material to the disc that would keep the inclination of the disc high. We suggest that the Be star disc can continue
to undergo KL oscillations provided that the spin of the Be star remains misaligned to the orbital plane and thus provides a source of
highly inclined material to the disc. Damping of the spin–orbit misalignment is expected to occur on the same timescale as rotation
synchronisation (Hut 1981; Eggleton & Kiseleva-Eggleton 2001).
The synchronisation timescale (Hurley, Tout & Pols 2002) is much
longer than the lifetime of the Be star except for the smallest orbital
period Be/X-ray binaries (Stoyanov & Zamanov 2009). Thus we
expect that a spin–orbit misalignment imparted by the supernova
that formed the neutron star to last for the lifetime of the Be/X-ray
binary.

4 DISC KL OSCILLATION TIMESCALE DEPENDENCE
ON BINARY ORBITAL PERIOD
The models presented so far have focused on the orbital parameters of the Be/X-ray binary system 4U 0115+634. We now examine how the mechanism operates for parameters relevant for Be/Xray binary systems with different orbital period. Fig. 7 shows the
KL oscillation timescale for a disc in a system with varying orbital period. We assume that the disc is truncated at Rt = (50/95) a,
which is relevant for binary eccentricity eb = 0.34 and disc inclination of i = 70◦ . We vary the semi–major axis a such that the
orbital period changes in the range 10 day < Porb < 500 day. Note

that smaller binary eccentricities and larger disc inclinations lead to
wider discs (Artymowicz & Lubow 1994; Lubow, Martin & Nixon
2015; Miranda & Lai 2015; Brown et al. 2019) and hence shorter
KL oscillation timescales. Generally, the KL oscillation timescale
is quite insensitive to the orbital period of the binary, within a factor
of 2, assuming that the disc has expanded out to the tidal truncation
radius. The viscous timescale at the outer edge of the disc increases
with binary separation. This viscous timescale exceeds the KL oscillation timescale for longer orbital period binaries.
The flared disc model lines in Fig. 7 are truncated where
H/R(R = Rt ) = (H/R)crit . For the isothermal disc model, we estimate the critical binary orbital period below which the Be star
disc is unstable to the KL mechanism. We require that the disc aspect ratio (Eq. 5 with s = 0.5) is less than or equal to (H/R)crit at
the tidal truncation radius and find

where (H/R)0 is the disc aspect ratio at R0 = 50 R⊙ and we defined
the ratio η = Rt /a. For longer binary orbital period, P > Pcrit , (i.e.
higher aspect ratios) the disc is stable against KL oscillations. We
have assumed that the disc is wide and viscous enough to reach
its tidal truncation radius. If the disc does not expand out to the
truncation radius, type II outbursts are not likely to occur. Therefore
equation (11) represents a necessary but not sufficient condition for
the disc to be KL unstable and thus for type II outbursts to occur.
Note that this critical period should also depend on both the
eccentricity and the inclination of the binary orbit but we have
only taken that into account through the parameter η. If the binary is less eccentric, or the disc is more inclined, the size of
the disc relative to the binary separation increases, i.e. η increases
(Artymowicz & Lubow 1994; Lubow, Martin & Nixon 2015). This
leads to a smaller critical orbital period since the more extended
disc has larger H/R in the disc outer parts and is more stable to KL
oscillations.
In summary, if the disc has a flared vertical structure, the disc
aspect ratio at the outer edge may exceed the critical value required
for it to be unstable to KL oscillations in systems with long binary
orbital periods. Thus, KL oscillations are more likely in smaller orbital period binaries. This is in agreement with observations that
show that type II outbursts are more likely to occur in short period binaries (Cheng, Shao & Li 2014). The critical orbital period
depends on the disc aspect ratio and the disc radial extent, which
depends on the eccentricity of the binary orbit, the inclination of
the disc and the mass ratio of the binary.

5 DISCUSSION
If KL disc oscillations drive type II outbursts, then any Be star Xray binary is expected to have type II outbursts providing that two
conditions are satisfied. First, the Be star decretion disc must be
misaligned to the binary orbital plane by more than the critical angle required for KL oscillations. For a test particle in an initially
circular orbit around one component of a circular orbit binary, this
is 39◦ . However this angle varies for thick decretion discs depending upon the properties of the disc (Lubow & Ogilvie 2017). Secondly, the orbital period of the binary must be short enough to allow the Be star disc to expand sufficiently far to overflow its Roche
lobe during a KL oscillation while still being unstable to KL oscillations (see equation (6)). This is in agreement with the observational data provided in Cheng, Shao & Li (2014) that show that

Figure 7. The KL oscillation timescale for an initially circular steady state
decretion disc with surface density distributed as equation (8) between the
stellar radius Rin = 8 R⊙ and Rt = 50/95a for s = 0.5 (solid lines), s = 0.25
(dashed lines) and s = 0 (dotted lines). The thick blue lines have (H/R)0 =
0.08 and the thin black lines have (H/R)0 = 0.06. The lines are truncated
where H/R = (H/R)crit . The blue lines lie exactly on top of the black lines.

Be/X-ray binaries with short orbital period are more likely to undergo type II outbursts. However, there are some observed systems
with long orbital periods that exhibit type II outbursts. GRO J100857 has an orbital period of 250 days and shows giant outbursts (e.g.
Kühnel et al. 2017). For this system to undergo KL oscillations,
the disc aspect ratio must be close to constant with radius for the
mechanism to operate. Swift J1626.6-5156, with an orbital period
of 132 days (e.g. Reig et al. 2011), and 1A 0535+262, with an orbital period of 111 days (Acciari et al. 2011) also show giant outbursts. In order for the KL disc mechanism to drive giant outbursts
in these systems the disc must not be very flared. The disc aspect
ratio must scale H/R ∝ R s with s . 0.25. The KL disc driven giant
outburst mechanism could be ruled out through observations of a
disc with a low misalignment or a high disc aspect ratio.
A large portion of the Be star disc may be destroyed during
the KL oscillation. The material can be re-accreted on to the Bestar (because the disc is highly eccentric), transferred to the neutron
star or to a circumbinary orbit (Franchini, Martin & Lubow 2019),
or be ejected from the binary star system. However, the disc continues to be fed at the inner edge from the Be star. The eccentricity
of the disc evolves due to the KL mechanism and due to the addition of circular orbit material at the inner edge. The KL oscillations
occur on a shorter timescale with smaller amplitude for a larger
initial particle eccentricity. Thus in the disc, this leads to a shorter
timescale before the next outburst. Since this leaves less time for
material to accumulate in the outer parts of the disc, we expect
a smaller outburst, as is observed for closely spaced outbursts in
4U 0115+634 (e.g. Reig & Blinov 2018). Thus, in a disc the KL
oscillations depend sensitively on how much material is left over
after the outburst, the eccentricity of the material and the decretion
rate of material into the disc from the star.

8

R. G. Martin & A. Franchini

The amount of material that is transferred from the Be star
disc to the neutron star depends on several parameters. In particular Franchini, Martin & Lubow (2019) found that for a globally
isothermal accretion disc (s = 0.5) the amount of material around
the secondary star was smaller compared to the case with a constant disc aspect ratio (s = 0). Also, a higher disc aspect ratio as
well as higher initial circumprimary disc inclination leads to larger
amount of material being transferred. Furthermore the lower the binary mass ratio, the higher the mass transfer to the secondary star.
This is relevant to this work because of the extreme mass ratios
of these systems. We expect the mass transfer to be very high in
Be star X-ray binaries undergoing KL oscillations and with Be star
discs filling the Roche lobe.
The inclination of the disc also has a significant affect on
the amount of mass transfer. The higher the initial disc inclination, the stronger the eccentricity growth and the more mass
that is transferred to the companion. For an inclination of 70◦
(but for an equal mass binary), most of the material in the Be
star disc was transferred to the companion (see Figure 10 in
Franchini, Martin & Lubow 2019).

6 CONCLUSIONS
We have found that KL oscillations of the Be star disc in the Be/Xray binary 4U 0115+364 operate on a timescale that matches the
observed frequency of type II (giant) X-ray outbursts provided that
the disc is not completely destroyed during the outburst. A highly
inclined disc around a Be star becomes eccentric and overflows its
Roche lobe so that material flows on to the companion neutron star.
The KL oscillation timescale for a disc depends sensitively on the
distribution of material within the disc and the eccentricity of the
material. Since the disc is depleted during a giant outburst, material
must be replenished between outbursts. The viscous timescale must
be short enough for the disc to spread outwards between outbursts.
For 4U 0115+634 this requires the disc aspect ratio at the outer disc
edge to be H/R & 0.06. However, the disc aspect ratio at the outer
disc edge must be small enough for the KL mechanism to operate,
H/R . 0.11. KL mechanism driven type II X-ray outbursts are
more likely to occur in shorter period binaries, if the disc is flared.
