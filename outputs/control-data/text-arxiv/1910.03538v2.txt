Abstract. In the present paper we prove sandwich classification for the overgroups of
the subsystem subgroup 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) of the Chevalley group 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) for the three types of
pairs (Φ, ∆) (the root system and its subsystem) such that the group 𝐺(∆, 𝑅)is (up to
torus) a Levi subgroup of the parabolic subgroup with abelian unipotent radical. Namely
we show that for any such an overgroup 𝐻 here exists a unique pair of ideals 𝜎 of the ring
𝑅 such that 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) 6 𝐻 6 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)).

1. Introduction
In the paper [20], dedicated to the maximal subgroups project, Michael Aschbacher introduced eight classes 𝐶1 -𝐶8 8 of subgroups of finite simple classical groups. The groups
from these classes are ”obvious” maximal subgroups of a finite classical groups. To be
precise, each subgroup from an Aschbacher class either is maximal itself or is contained in
a maximal subgroup that in its turn either also belongs to an Aschbacher class or can be
constructed by a certain explicit procedure.
Nikolai Vavilov defined five classes of “large” subgroups of the Chevalley groups (including exceptional ones) over arbitrary rings (see [17] for details). Although these subgroups
are not maximal, he conjectured that they are sufficiently large for the corresponding
overgroup lattice to admit a description. One of these classes is the class of subsystem
subgroups (the definition will be given in Subsection 2.1).
Overgroups of (elementary) subsystem subgroups of the general linear group were studied
in the papers [4], [1], [2], [3], [5].In that case, subsystem subgroups are precisely blockdiagonal subgroups. This results were generalized to orthogonal and symplectic groups
under the assumption 2 ∈ 𝑅* in the thesis of Nikolai Vavilov (see also [7], [8] and [10]).
After that, this assumption was lifted in the thesis of Alexander Shchegolev [28]. In that
thesis, Shchegolev also solved the problem for unitary groups (see also [18] and [19]).
The problem we discuss in the present paper is to describe the overgroups of subsystem
subgroups of exceptional groups (over a commutative ring). This problem was posed in [13]
(Problem 7). The first step of solving this problem was done in [14].The table from that
paper contains the list of pairs (Φ, ∆) for which such a description may be possible in

principle, along with the number of ideals determining the level and along with certain
links between these ideals.
By a standard description we mean ”sandwich classification”. Let 𝐺 be an abstract
group, and let L be a certain lattice of its subgroups. The lattice L admits sandwich
classification if it is a disjoint union of ”sandwiches”:
L=

⨆︁

𝐿(𝐹𝑖 , 𝑁𝑖 ),

𝑖

𝐿(𝐹𝑖 , 𝑁𝑖 ) = {𝐻 : 𝐹𝑖 6 𝐻 6 𝑁𝑖 },
where 𝑖 runs through some index set, and 𝐹𝑖 is a normal subgroup of 𝑁𝑖 for all 𝑖. To
study such a lattice, it suffices to study the quotients 𝑁𝑖 /𝐹𝑖 . In [14] it was conjectured that
the lattice of subgroups of a Chevalley group that contain a sufficiently large subsystem
subgroup admits sandwich classification.
In the present paper, we prove a sandwich classification theorem for the embeddings
𝐴𝑙−1 6 𝐷𝑙 (where 𝑙 > 5), 𝐷5 6 𝐸6 , and 𝐸6 6 𝐸7 . Our approach allows us to consider all
three cases simultaneously. In all these cases, the corresponding subsystem subgroup is (up
to a torus) a Levi subgroup 𝐿𝛼 , where 𝛼 is a fundamental root such that its coefficient in
the decomposition of a maximal root is equal to one. In that case, the level is determined
by two ideals. One can add to this list the embedding 𝐴𝑙−1 6 𝐴𝑙 , for which the main result
follows, of course, from the paper [3]. The fact that in all these cases the corresponding
unipotent radical is Abelian simplifies our problem from a technical point of view.
Overgroup description for the embeding 𝐴𝑙−1 6 𝐷𝑙 is a special case of the results obtained
in [6] and [28]. Another two cases considered in the present paper are new.
We mention two previous results that are closely related to the present paper.
∙ Over a field (distinct from 𝐹3 and of characteristic not equal to 2), overgroup
description in the cases considered in the present paper was obtained by Wang
Dengyin in [35]. His proof involves Bruhat decomposition.
∙ Description of subgroups of a maximal parabolic subgroup that contain the elementary Levi subgroup was obtained in the paper of Anastasia Stavrova [29]. Note
that over a field such a description had been obtained before in the papers of Wang
Dengyin and Li ShangZhi [36] and Victoria Kozakevich and Anastasia Stavrova [15].

2. Basic notation
2.1. Root systems and Chevalley groups. Let Φ be an irreducible root system, P a
lattice that is intermediate between the root lattice Q(Φ) and the weight lattice P(Φ), 𝑅 a
commutative associative ring with unity, 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) = 𝐺P (Φ, 𝑅) a Chevalley group of type Φ
over 𝑅, 𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅) = 𝑇P (Φ, 𝑅) a split maximal torus of 𝐺P (Φ, 𝑅). For every root 𝛼 ∈ Φ we
2

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
denote by 𝑋𝛼 = {𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) : 𝜉 ∈ 𝑅} the corresponding unipotent root subgroup with respect
to 𝑇 . We denote by 𝐸(Φ, 𝑅) = 𝐸P (Φ, 𝑅)the elementary subgroup generated by all 𝑋𝛼 .
Let ∆ be a subsystem of Φ. We denote by 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) the subgroup of 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) generated
by all 𝑋𝛼 , where 𝛼 ∈ ∆. It is called an (elementary) subsystem subgroup. It can be shown
that it is an elementary subgroup of a Chevalley group 𝐺(∆, 𝑅) embedded into the group
𝐺(Φ, 𝑅). Here the lattice between Q(∆) and P(∆) is an orthogonal projection of P to the
corresponding subspace.
We are going to describe intermediate subgroups between 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) and 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅). For
each case considered in the present paper, we fix a basic representation 𝑉 of the group
𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) (i.e., a representation that has a basis consisting of weight vectors such that the
Weyl group acts transitively on the set of nonzero weights, see [27]) and we assume that
the lattice P is such that this representation is faithful (therefore, P is uniquely determined
by the representation).
Here is the list of the cases we consider:
(a) Φ = 𝐷𝑙 , ∆ = 𝐴𝑙−1 (𝑙 > 5), 𝑉 = 𝑉𝜛𝑙 (half-spin representation).
(b) Φ = 𝐸6 , ∆ = 𝐷5 , 𝑉 = 𝑉𝜛𝑙 .
(c) Φ = 𝐸7 , ∆ = 𝐸6 , 𝑉 = 𝑉𝜛7 .
The embedding of ∆ into Φ is obtained by crossing out a vertex of the Dynkin diagram
as shown in Figure 1.
Let us fix an order on the system Φ and denote by Π = {𝛼1 , . . ., 𝛼𝑙 } the corresponding
set of fundamental roots; its enumeration is also shown in Figure 1. Let 𝛼(1) be the root
that corresponds to the vertex crossed out, and 𝛼(2) the root that corresponds to the vertex
that is adjacent to the crossed out one.
Let ∆′ be the subsystem of ∆ obtained by crossing out both 𝛼(1) and 𝛼(2) . Furthermore,
let ∆′′ be equal to ∆′ in cases (b) and (c) and to its irreducible component distinct from
𝐴1 (it is important that 𝑙 > 5) in case (a).
′
The symbols Ω± , Σ±,0
𝜆1 , ∆𝜆1 , and (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 ) will be introduced in Lemmas 6 and 11.
2.2. Affine schemes. The functor 𝐺(Φ, −) from the category of rings to the category of
groups is an affine group scheme (a Chevalley–Demazure scheme). This means that its
composition with the forgetful functor to the category of sets is representable, i.e.,
𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) = Hom(Z[𝐺], 𝑅).
The ring Z[𝐺] here is called the ring of regular functions on the scheme 𝐺(Φ, −).
An element 𝑔gen ∈ 𝐺(Φ, Z[𝐺]), that corresponds to the identity ring homomorphism is
called the generic element of the scheme 𝐺(Φ, −). This element has a universal property:
for any ring 𝑅 and for any 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅), there exists a unique ring homomorphism
𝑓 : Z[𝐺] → 𝑅
such that 𝑓* (𝑔gen ) = 𝑔. For details about application of the method of generic element to
the problems similar to our problem see the paper of Alexei Stepanov [32]. We will use
this method in the second part of Lemma 32 to avoid problems with zero divisors of the
ring 𝑅.

Figure 1.
Later, we will define the scheme R(−) of the root type elements and introduce a similar
notation for it.
The identity element of the group 𝐺(Φ, Z) corresponds to the augmentation homomorphism
𝜀 : Z[𝐺] → Z.
Its kernel is called the augmentation ideal. We denote it by 𝐼aug .
2.3. Representation 𝑉 . Let Λ be the set of weights of the representation 𝑉 . A basis of
𝑉 V is indexed by the weights from Λ. We denote this basis by {𝑣 𝜆 : 𝜆 ∈ Λ}.
The order we fixed on the system Φ induces a partial order on the set Λ:: a weight 𝜆 is
bigger than a weight 𝜇 if 𝜆 − 𝜇 is the sum of positive roots.
Root elements of the group 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) act on the elements of this basis as follows:
{︃
𝑣 𝜆 + 𝑣 𝜆+𝛼 𝑐𝜆𝛼 𝜉 if 𝜆 + 𝛼 ∈ Λ,
𝑥𝛼 (𝜉)𝑣 𝜆 =
𝑣𝜆
if 𝜆 + 𝛼 ∈
/ Λ,
where the structure constants 𝑐𝜆𝛼 of the action are equal to ±1 (Matsumoto’s lemma [26],
[30]). Moreover, we choose {𝑣 𝜆 } to be a crystal basis, i.e., 𝑐𝜆𝛼 = 1 if 𝛼 ∈ ±Π. The existence
of such a basis was proved in [34], [22], [9].

Therefore, the weight diagram describes the action of 𝐸(Φ, 𝑅) on the module 𝑉 completely. This action has a unique extension that is an algebraic action of the group 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅).
Weights from Λ correspond to the vertices of the weight diagram (see [27]). To describe
the action of the group 𝐺(∆, 𝑅) on the module 𝑉 , one should remove the edges of the weight
diagram labeled by 𝛼(1) . The new diagram will have a number of connected components,
which can be enumerated Λ0 , Λ1 , . . . in such a way that whenever 𝑖 > 𝑗 any weight from
Λ𝑖 is less that any weight from Λ𝑗 with respect to the order we fix. The set Λ0 contains
only one weight — the highest one, we denote it by 𝜆0 .
For any pair of weights 𝜆,𝜇 ∈ Λ we denote by 𝑑(𝜆, 𝜇) the distance between them (i.e.,
the length of the shortest path) in the weight graph (two weights are adjacent in the weight
graph if their difference belongs to Φ).
2.4. Group theoretic notation.
∙ Recall that for abstract groups 𝐴, 𝐵 6 𝐺, the transporter from 𝐴 to 𝐵 is the set
Tran𝐺 (𝐴, 𝐵) = {𝑔 ∈ 𝐺 : 𝑔𝐴𝑔 −1 ⊆ 𝐵}.
∙ We denote by 𝑁𝐺 (Γ) the normaliser of the group Γ in the group 𝐺.
∙ If the group 𝐺 acts on the set 𝑋 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, we denote by Stab𝐺 (𝑥) the stabiliser
of the element 𝑥.
∙ Commutators are left normalised:
[𝑥, 𝑦] = 𝑥𝑦𝑥−1 𝑦 −1 .
∙ If 𝑋 is a subset of the group 𝐺, we denote by ⟨𝑋⟩ the subgroup generated by 𝑋.
∙ We denote by 𝐷𝑖 𝐺 the 𝑖th member of the derived series, i.e., 𝐷0 𝐺 = 𝐺 and 𝐷𝑖+1 𝐺 =
[𝐷𝑖 𝐺, 𝐷𝑖 𝐺].
2.5. Matrices. We identify any element 𝑔 of the group 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) with the matrix of its
action on the module 𝑉 in the crystal basis. Rows and columns of such a matrix are
indexed by weights from Λ. We denote by 𝑔𝜆,𝜇 the entry of this matrix in the 𝜆th row
and the 𝜇th column. We denote by 𝑔*,𝜇 the 𝜇th column of the matrix 𝑔, which we identify
with a vector from 𝑉 . Similarly, we denote by 𝑔𝜆,* the 𝜆th row of the matrix 𝑔, which we
identify with a covector from 𝑉 * .
2.6. Relative subgroups. For a root system Φ, a ring 𝑅 and an ideal 𝐼 E 𝑅 we denote
by 𝜌𝐼 the reduction homomorphism
𝜌𝐼 : 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) → 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅/𝐼),
induced by the projection of 𝑅 to the quotient ring 𝑅/𝐼. We denote by 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼) the
principal congruence subgroup of the group 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅)
𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼) = Ker 𝜌𝐼 .
We denote by 𝐶𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼) the full congruence subgroup, i.e., the inverse image of the
center of the group 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅/𝐼) under the reduction homomorphism 𝜌𝐼 .
We denote by 𝐸(Φ, 𝐼) the subgroup generated by the root elements of the level 𝐼:
𝐸(Φ, 𝐼) = ⟨{𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) : 𝛼 ∈ Φ, 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼}⟩.
5

p. gvozdevsky
We denote by 𝐸(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼) the relative elementary subgroup of the level 𝐼, i.e., the normal
closure of the group 𝐸(Φ, 𝐼) in the group 𝐸(Φ, 𝑅). As a subgroup, 𝐸(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼) is generated
be the elements 𝑧𝛼 (𝜉, 𝜁) = 𝑥𝛼 (𝜁)𝑥−𝛼 (𝜉)𝑥𝛼 (−𝜁), where 𝛼 ∈ Φ, 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼 and 𝜁 ∈ 𝑅 (see [33]).
The following facts about this group are well known.
Lemma 1. (Standard commutator formula ) If rk Φ > 2, then 𝐸(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼) is a normal
subgroup of 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) and
[𝐸(Φ, 𝑅), 𝐶𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼)] 6 𝐸(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼).
Lemma 2. (see [33]) Let 𝐼 E 𝑅. Then
𝐸(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼 2 ) 6 𝐸(Φ, 𝐼).
2.7. Nilpotent structure of 𝐾1 . We will use the following fact proved in [21].
Lemma 3. For an arbitrary commutative ring 𝑅 of finite Bass–Serre dimension (in particular, for any finitely generated ring) and an arbitrary idea 𝐼 E 𝑅, the quotient group
𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼)/𝐸(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼) has a nilpotent normal subgroup with Abelian quotient group (in
particular, it is solvable).
2.8. Parabolic subgroups. Assume that we consider one of cases (a)–(c).
We denote by 𝑃 = 𝑃𝛼(1) the parabolic subgroup of the group 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅), that corresponds
to the root 𝛼(1) .
This subgroup 𝑃 coincides with the stabiliser of the line generated by the highest weight
vector. The stabiliser of the line generated by the vector of the weight 𝜆 ∈ Λ is also a
parabolic subgroup (it is conjugate to 𝑃 by an element of the Weyl group1, that maps the
highest weight to the weight 𝜆), we will denote it by 𝑃𝜆 .
We denote the corresponding opposite parabolic subgroups by 𝑃 − and 𝑃𝜆− , respectively.
The subgroup 𝑃𝜆− can be described as the stabiliser of the line generated by the covector
that corresponds to the weigh 𝜆. In other words, the subgroup 𝑃𝜆 consist of the matrices
such that their 𝜆th column is a multiple of the corresponding column of the identity matrix.
Similarly, the subgroup 𝑃𝜆− consists of the matrices such that their 𝜆th row is a multiple
the corresponding row of the identity matrix.
The unipotent radicals of these parabolic subgroups will be denoted by 𝑈 , 𝑈𝜆 , 𝑈 − , and
−
𝑈𝜆 , respectively. The correspondent Levi subgroups will be denoted by 𝐿 and 𝐿𝜆 (opposite
parabolic subgroups have the same Levi subgroups).
The following statements are well known.
Lemma 4. In each of cases (a)–(c)
(1)
𝐿𝜆 = 𝑃𝜆 ∩ 𝑃𝜆− .

are considering basic representation without zero weight. This means exactly that the Weyl group

(4) The groups 𝑈𝜆 and 𝑈𝜆− are Abelian.
3. Combinatorial lemmas
In this section, we assume that we are considering one of cases (a)–(c), which were listed
at the beginning of the paper.
Let 𝑊 (Φ) and 𝑊 (∆) be the Weyl groups of the corresponding root systems.
Lemma 5. The coefficient of 𝛼(1) in the decomposition of the maximal root is equal to one.
The coefficient of 𝛼(2) is equal to two.
Proof. Direct calculation in each case.



Lemma 6. The set Φ ∖ ∆ has exactly two 𝑊 (∆)-orbits: the roots such that in their expansion in fundamental roots the coefficient of 𝛼(1) is equal to 1, and the roots such that it is
equal to −1. We will denote these orbits by Ω+ and Ω− respectively.
Proof. We prove that if a root 𝛼 ∈ Φ, has coefficient of 𝛼(1) equal to 1,then it lies in one
𝑊 (∆)–orbit with the maximal root (the proof for the opposite roots is the same).
One can obtain the maximal root from the root 𝛼 by adding fundamental roots step by
step. All these fundamental roots are distinct from 𝛼(1) , (hence they belong to ∆) because
the coefficient of 𝛼(1) in the expansion of 𝛼 is already maximal possible. If one root is
obtained from another by adding a root from ∆, then it is also obtained by reflection with
respect to this root (because all roots have the same length). Therefore, all roots in the
chain from 𝛼 to the maximal root lie in the same 𝑊 (∆)-orbit.

Lemma 7. The set ∆ ∖ ∆′ has exactly two 𝑊 (∆′ )-orbits: the roots such that in their
expansion in fundamental roots the coefficient of 𝛼(2) is equal to 1, and the roots such that
it is equal to −1.
Proof. The arguments are similar to the proof of the previous lemma.



Lemma 8. Suppose 𝛽 ∈ Φ ∖ ∆; then there exists a root 𝛼 ∈ ∆ such that 𝛼 + 𝛽 ∈ Φ.
Proof. Using the action of the Weyl group 𝑊 (∆) we may assume that 𝛽 = ±𝛼(1) . In this
case, we can take 𝛼 = ±𝛼(2) .

Lemma 9. Suppose 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ ; then 𝜆0 − 𝛼 ∈ Λ.
Proof. Note that the weight 𝜆0 is fixed by the group 𝑊 (∆). Hence using the action of the
Weyl group 𝑊 (∆) we may assume that 𝛼 = 𝛼(1) . In each of cases (a)–(c), one can see on
the weight diagram that the highest weight is, indeed, adjacent to another one by the edge
labeled with 𝛼(1) .

7

p. gvozdevsky
Lemma 10. Suppose 𝛼 ∈ Φ and 𝜆, 𝜌, 𝜆 − 𝛼, 𝜌 + 𝛼 ∈ Λ are such that 𝜆 − 𝛼 ̸= 𝜌; then
𝑑(𝜆, 𝜌) > 2.
Proof. First, using the action of the group 𝑊 (Φ), we may assume that 𝜆 = 𝜆0 is the highest
weight. Second, using the action of the group 𝑊 (∆), we may also assume that 𝛼 = 𝛼(1) .
Consider the difference 𝜆 − (𝜌 + 𝛼). To calculate this difference, one should consider the
path on the weight diagram between the vertices 𝜆 and 𝜌 + 𝛼 (since 𝜆 is the highest weight,
this path can always be chosen going from the left to the right), and take the sum of the
fundamental roots corresponding to the edges of this path. Note that 𝛼(1) appears in this
sum at least once because this is the only edge incident to the vertex 𝜆0 , and 𝜆 ̸= 𝜌 + 𝛼
by assumption. Therefore, in the expansion of 𝜆 − 𝜌 in fundamental roots, the coefficient
of𝛼(1) is at least 2; hence by Lemma 5, 𝜆 − 𝜌 is not a root.

Lemma 11. Suppose 𝜆1 ∈ Λ1 . We introduce the following notation: Σ𝜆1 = {𝛼 ∈ Φ : 𝜆1 −
𝛼 ∈ Λ}. Next, we split this set in three disjoint subsets:
+
0
Σ𝜆1 = Σ−
𝜆1 ⊔ Σ𝜆1 ⊔ Σ𝜆1 ,

where
−
Σ−
𝜆1 = Σ𝜆1 ∩ Ω ,

Σ0𝜆1 = Σ𝜆1 ∩ ∆,

+
Σ+
𝜆1 = Σ𝜆1 ∩ Ω .

Let ∆𝜆1 be the image of ∆ under reflection with respect to 𝜆0 − 𝜆1 . Then the following
holds.
(1) Σ−
𝜆1 = {𝜆1 − 𝜆0 }.
(2) Σ0𝜆1 ̸= ∅ and for any 𝛼 ∈ Σ0𝜆1 there exists a root 𝛽 ∈ Σ0𝜆1 such that 𝛼 − 𝛽 ∈ Φ.
(3) For any 𝛽 ∈ Σ+
𝜆1 there exists a root 𝛾 ∈ ∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 such that 𝛽 + 𝛾 ∈ Φ, but
𝜆1 − 𝜆0 + 𝛾 ∈
/ Φ.
(4) The subsystem ∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 has an irreducible component (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ distinct from 𝐴1 .
Next, for any weight 𝜇 ∈ Λ1 ∖ {𝜆1 } there exists a weight 𝜈 ∈ Λ1 ∖ {𝜆1 } such that
𝜇 − 𝜈 ∈ (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ .
(5) For any 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ such that ⟨𝛼, 𝜆0 − 𝜆1 ⟩ = 1, there exists a root 𝛾 ∈ Σ0𝜆1 such that
𝛼 + 𝛾 ∈ Φ.
Proof. Using the action of the group 𝑊 (∆), we may assume that 𝜆0 −𝜆1 = 𝛼(1) . Therefore,
we have ∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 = ∆′ , and in Item (4) we have (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ = ∆′′ . Let 𝑤𝛼(1) ∈ 𝑊 (Φ) be
reflection with respect to the root 𝛼(1) . This reflection maps 𝜆0 to 𝜆1 ; hence it maps Ω+
to Σ𝜆1 .
We prove items (1) and (2). Since 𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼(1) = −𝛼(1) , we have −𝛼(1) ∈ Σ−
𝜆1 . Suppose that
+
(1)
(1)
𝛼 ∈ Ω and 𝛼 ̸= 𝛼 , then ⟨𝛼, 𝛼 ⟩ is equal either to 0 or to 1 (because 𝛼 + 𝛼(1) ∈
/ Φ). In
the first case, we have
𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼 = 𝛼 ∈ Σ+
𝜆1 .
In the second case, we have
𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼 = 𝛼 − 𝛼(1) ∈ Σ0𝜆1 .
Item (1) is, therefore, proved.
8

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
Furthermore, if 𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼 ∈ Σ0𝜆1 , then ⟨𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼, 𝛼(1) ⟩ = −1 (because ⟨𝛼, 𝛼(1) ⟩ = 1).Hence the
coefficient of 𝛼(2) in the expansion of 𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼 is equal to 1. Conversely, if the coefficient of
𝛼(2) in the expansion of the root 𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼 ∈ ∆ is equal to 1, then
𝛼 = 𝑤𝛼(1) 𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼 = 𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼 + 𝛼(1) ∈ Ω+ .
Hence 𝑤𝛼(1) 𝛼 ∈ Σ0𝜆1 .
Therefore, the set Σ0𝜆1 ⊆ ∆ is an analog of the set Ω+ for the pair (∆, ∆′ ). Now, clearly,
it is not empty, and the second part of item (2) follows from an analog of Lemma 8 for the
pair (∆, ∆′ ).
We prove item (3). From the above, it follows that ⟨𝛽, 𝛼(1) ⟩ = 0. Hence the coefficient
of 𝛼(2) in the expansion of 𝛽 ? is equal to 2. Therefore, the maximal root can be obtained
from 𝛽 by adding (= reflecting with respect to) simple roots from ∆′ step by step. Using
the action of the group 𝑊 (∆′ ) we may assume that 𝛽 is a maximal root. Now we can take
𝛾 = −𝛼𝑘 , where 𝛼𝑘 is a simple root that corresponds to the vertex of the Dynkin diagram
that is adjacent to the additional vertex in the affine diagram.2
The first part of Item (4) has already been proved above. Moreover, (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ = ∆′′ .
Looking at the weight diagram, one can easily check the second part.
Let us prove Item (5). By hypothesis, 𝛼 − 𝛼(1) ∈ ∆, and coefficient of 𝛼(2) in its
decomposition is equal to one. Using the action of the group 𝑊 (∆′ ), we can assume that
the sum of coefficients in the decomposition of 𝛼 in simple roots is maximal among all
such sums for the roots from the 𝑊 (∆′ )-orbit of 𝛼. There is a simple root 𝛼𝑘 , such that
𝛼 + 𝛼𝑘 ∈ Φ. The root 𝛼𝑘 cannot be equal to 𝛼(1) because the coefficient of 𝛼(1) is already
equal to 1. Also the root 𝛼𝑘 cannot be in ∆′ ; otherwise, 𝛼 + 𝛼𝑘 would be a root from the
𝑊 (∆′ )-orbit of 𝛼 with bigger sum of coefficients. Hence 𝛼 + 𝛼(2) ∈ Φ and we can take
𝛾 = 𝛼(2) .

Lemma 12. Let 𝜆1 ∈ Λ1 ; then:
(1) there exists 𝜇 ∈ Λ1 such that 𝑑(𝜆1 , 𝜇) = 1;
(2) let 𝜈 ∈ Λ1 be a weight such that 𝑑(𝜆1 , 𝜈) = 1; then there exists 𝜇 ∈ Λ1 such that
𝑑(𝜇, 𝜈) = 𝑑(𝜆1 , 𝜇) = 1.
Proof. To each weight 𝜇 ∈ Λ1 such that 𝑑(𝜆1 , 𝜇) = 1, we assign a root 𝜆1 − 𝜇 ∈ Σ0𝜆1 . This
correspondence is bijective. Therefore, this lemma is merely a restatement of Item 2 of
Lemma 11.

4. Level computation
For now, let ∆, Φ, and P be arbitrary. Let 𝐻 be an overgroup of the group 𝐸(∆, 𝑅),
i.e. 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) 6 𝐻 6 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅). For each root 𝛼 ∈ Φ ∖ ∆ we set 𝐼𝛼 = {𝜉 ∈ 𝑅 : 𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) ∈ 𝐻}.
In the paper [14] (Lemmas 1 and 3), the following was proved.
Lemma 13.

(1) The set 𝐼𝛼 is an ideal of the ring 𝑅.

2It

is important that 𝑙 > 5, and that we do not consider the case 𝐷𝑙−1 6 𝐷𝑙 . Theorem 1 is not true for
these subsystems because we can take 𝐻 = 𝐺(𝐵𝑙−1 , 𝑅).
9

(2) The ideal 𝐼𝛼 depends only on the 𝑊 (∆)-orbit of the root 𝛼.
Now we assume that we are considering one of cases (a)–(c) that were listed in the
begining of the paper. Recall that by Lemma 6, the set Φ ∖ ∆ has exactly two 𝑊 (∆)orbits: Ω+ and Ω− . We denote the corresponding ideals 𝐼𝛼 by 𝐼 + and 𝐼 − respectively.
The pair 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ) is called the level of the overgroup 𝐻. We will write 𝜎 = lev(𝐻).
Now let 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ) be an arbitrary pair of ideals of the ring 𝑅, We introduce the
following notation:
𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) = ⟨𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) : 𝛼 ∈ ∆, 𝜉 ∈ 𝑅
or 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ , 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼 + or 𝛼 ∈ Ω− , 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼 − ⟩ 6 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅),
𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝑅, 𝐼 − )) = (𝜌𝐼 − )−1 (𝑃 ) 6 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅),
𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)) = (𝜌𝐼 + )−1 (𝑃 − ) 6 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅),
𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) = 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝑅, 𝐼 − )) ∩ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)) 6 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅).
It is easily seen that
𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) 6 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎),
and also that
𝜎 6 lev (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 lev (𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 𝜎
(we write 𝜎1 6 𝜎2 if 𝐼1+ ⊆ 𝐼2+ and 𝐼1− ⊆ 𝐼2− ). Hence in fact, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 14. We have
lev (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) = lev (𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) = 𝜎.
Therefore, any pair of ideals is a level of some overgroup of the group 𝐸(∆, 𝑅). Let us
also compute the level of the group 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Lemma 15. . We have
lev(𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎))) = 𝜎.

Proof. First,
lev(𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎))) > lev(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) = 𝜎.
We prove the inverse inclusion. Assume that 𝑥𝛽 (𝜉) ∈ 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)),
where 𝛽 ∈ Ω+ , but 𝜉 ∈
/ 𝐼 + (the proof for Ω− is similar). Take 𝛼 from Lemma 8; then
𝑥𝛼 (1) ∈ 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎). Hence we have [𝑥𝛼 (1), 𝑥𝛽 (𝜉)] ∈ 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎). On the
other hand, we have [𝑥𝛼 (1), 𝑥𝛽 (𝜉)] = 𝑥𝛼+𝛽 (±𝜉), where 𝛼 + 𝛽 ∈ Ω+ , which contradicts the
fact that lev(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) = 𝜎.

5. The statement of the main result
In the present paper, we prove the following theorem
Theorem 1. Assume that we are considering one of cases (a)–(c) listed at the begining of
the paper, i.e
(a) Φ = 𝐷𝑙 , ∆ = 𝐴𝑙−1 (where 𝑙 > 5), 𝑉 = 𝑉𝜛𝑙 (half-spin representation).
(b) Φ = 𝐸6 , ∆ = 𝐷5 , 𝑉 = 𝑉𝜛𝑙 .
(c) Φ = 𝐸7 , ∆ = 𝐸6 , 𝑉 = 𝑉𝜛7 .
Let 𝑅 be a commutative ring (associative with unit). . Then for any group 𝐻 such that
𝐸(∆, 𝑅) 6 𝐻 6 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅),
there exists a unique pair of ideals 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ) of the ring 𝑅, such that
𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) 6 𝐻 6 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) .
Note that uniqueness has already been proved: indeed, by Lemmas 14 and 15 the pair
𝜎 must be equal to the pair lev(𝐻). If we set 𝜎 = lev(𝐻), then the left inclusion in the
theorem holds true by the definition of a level. Thus, it remains to prove the right inclusion.
It is natural to call the subgroup 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝑅, 0)) the elementary parabolic subgroup.
Note that Theorem 1 gives us an overgroup description for such a subgroup.
Corollary 1. Assume that we are considering one of cases (a)–(c) that are listed at the
begining of the paper. Let 𝑅 be a commutative ring. Then for any group 𝐻 such that
𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝑅, 0)) 6 𝐻 6 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅),
there exists a unique ideal 𝐼 − of 𝑅 such that
(︀
)︀
𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝑅, 𝐼 − )) 6 𝐻 6 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝑅, 𝐼 − )) .
Similarly, we obtain the same result for the subgroup 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (0, 𝑅)).
To formulate the second main result, we divide cases (a)–(c) into two groups. Let 𝑛+1 —
be the number of connected components Λ0 ,. . .,Λ𝑛 of the weight diagram after removing
the edges labeled with 𝛼(1) . Note that for 𝑖 ̸= 0,𝑛 the component Λ𝑖 has at least two
weights. Indeed, given a weight from such a component we can always add a simple root
to it, and we can always subtract a simple root from it (so that the result is still in Λ). At
least one of these roots is distinct from 𝛼(1) because the representation is minuscule.
Therefore, two cases are possible. We say that we are considering the case of the first
type if Λ0 is the only component containing only one weight (that includes case (a) with
𝑙 odd, and also case (b)). We say that we are considering the case of the second type if
there are two such components, Λ0 and Λ𝑛 (that includes case (a) with 𝑙 even, and also
case (c)). In the second case it is easily seen that Λ𝑛 = {−𝜆0 }.
Theorem 2. Let 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ) be a pair of ideals of the ring 𝑅; then:
11

p. gvozdevsky
(1) for the cases of the first type, we have
𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) = 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
(2) for the cases of the second type, the group 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) consists of exactly
the elements 𝑔 of the group 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) that satisfy the following conditions:
𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆 ∈ 𝐼 +

∀𝜆 ∈ Λ ∖ {𝜆0 , −𝜆0 },

𝑔𝜆0 ,−𝜆0 𝐼 − ⊆ 𝐼 + ,
(𝑔 −1 )𝜆,𝜆0 ∈ 𝐼 −

∀𝜆 ∈ Λ ∖ {𝜆0 , −𝜆0 },

(𝑔 −1 )−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 𝐼 + ⊆ 𝐼 − .
Agreement
At this point, we begin the proof of Theorem 1, i.e., below we always assume that we
are considering one of cases (a)–(c) that were listed at the begining of the paper
6. Normalizer of the subgroup 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)
Lemma 16. Let 𝐼 E 𝑅; then
𝑈 ∩ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼) = ⟨{𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) : 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼, 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ }⟩,
and the same is true for 𝑈 − .
Proof. Obviously, the right-hand side is contained in the left-hand side, let us prove the
inverse inclusion. Let 𝑔 ∈ 𝑈 ∩ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼). Since 𝑔 ∈ 𝑈 , by Items 3 and 4 of Lemma 4, the
element 𝑔 can be writen as the product
∏︁
𝑔=
𝑥𝛼 (𝜉𝛼 ),
where 𝜉𝛼 ∈ 𝑅.
𝛼∈Ω+

Fixing 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ , we prove that 𝜉𝛼 ∈ 𝐼. Let 𝜌 = 𝜆0 − 𝛼; then by Lemma 9, we have 𝜌 ∈ Λ.
Note that for an arbitrary matrix ℎ and for 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ ∖ {𝛼} we have
(𝑥𝛼 (𝜉𝛼 )ℎ)𝜆0 ,𝜌 = ℎ𝜆0 ,𝜌 .
Indeed, otherwise we have 𝜌 + 𝛼 ∈ Λ, and by Lemma 9 we also have 𝜆0 − 𝛼 ∈ Λ, which
contradicts Lemma 10 .
Therefore,
𝜉𝛼 = ±(𝑥𝛼 (𝜉𝛼 ))𝜆0 ,𝜌 = ±𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜌 ∈ 𝐼.

In the lemmas below, let 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ), 𝐼 ± E 𝑅, and let 𝐽 = (𝐼 + ∩ 𝐼 − )2 .
Lemma 17. Assume that 𝐽 = 0; then
(1) 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) = 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅).
(2) the subgroup 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) is normal in 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
12

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
Proof. First, note that the subgroup 𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅) normalises the subgroup
𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎); hence Item 2 follows from Item 1. Indeed, 𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅) normalises each of
the subgroups {𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) : 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼}, where 𝛼 ∈ Φ and 𝐼 equals 𝐼 ± or 𝑅. Furthermore, 𝐺(∆, 𝑅)
normalises 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) (this is a special case of Lemma 1). Finally, if 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ , 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼 + and
𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(∆, 𝑅) 6 𝐿, then by Lemma 16 we have
[𝑥𝛼 (𝜉), 𝑔] ∈ 𝑈 ∩ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐼 + ) = ⟨{𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) : 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼 + , 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ }⟩ ⊆ 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
The case of Ω− and 𝐼 − is similar.
Therefore, it remains to prove Item 1. Obviously, the right-hand side is contained in the
left-hand side, let us prove the inverse inclusion.
Let 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎). Since all the rows and columns of an invertible matrix are
unimodular, and all the entries in the first column except 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆0 belong to 𝐼 − , the element
𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆0 is invertible modulo 𝐼 − . Similarly, we deduce that it is invertible modulo 𝐼 + . Hence
it is invertible modulo 𝐽, i.e., it is simply an invertible element of the ring 𝑅.
Therefore, we can apply to the matrix 𝑔 the special case of the Chevalley–Matsumoto
decomposition (see [23], [26], [30]) asserting that if 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) and 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆0 ∈ 𝑅* , then
𝑔 = 𝑣𝑔1 𝑢,
where 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 , 𝑣 ∈ 𝑈 − and 𝑔1 ∈ 𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅). Arguing as in the proof of Lemma 16,
and using the fact that 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), we see that actually
𝑢 ∈ ⟨{𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) : 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼 + , 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ }⟩ 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎),
and
𝑣 ∈ ⟨{𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) : 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼 − , 𝛼 ∈ Ω− }⟩ 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
To finish the proof, it remains to note that the subgroup 𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅) normalises the
subgroup 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).

Lemma 18. If the ring 𝑅 is finitely generated, then there exists a natural number 𝑁 such
that
𝐷𝑁 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) = 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Proof. First, the right-hand side is contained in the left-hand side for every 𝑁 because the
group 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) is obviously perfect. We prove the inverse inclusion.
We start with the case where 𝐽 = 0 and prove that
𝐷𝑖 (𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐷𝑖 (𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅)).
The proof is by induction on 𝑖. The base of induction, for 𝑖 = 0, 0, follows from Lemma 17.
Now, we pass to the induction step. By the inductive hypothesis, we have
𝐷𝑖+1 (𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6
6 [𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐷𝑖 (𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅)), 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐷𝑖 (𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅))].
As a normal subgroup of 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), the last group is generated by the commutators
[𝑥, 𝑦], where 𝑥,𝑦 ∈ 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) ∪ 𝐷𝑖 (𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅)). By item 2 of Lemma 17 all these
13

p. gvozdevsky
commutators belong to 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐷𝑖+1 (𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅)); hence it remains to prove that
this subgroup is normal in 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), but this follows immediately from the fact that the
subgroup 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) is normal in the group 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), and 𝐷𝑖+1 (𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅))
is normal in 𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅).
Further, note that
𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐷𝑖 (𝑇 (Φ, 𝑅)𝐺(∆, 𝑅)) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐷𝑖−1 (𝐺(∆, 𝑅)),
and by Lemma 3 , if 𝑖 is sufficiently large, then the right-hand side is contained in
𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐸(∆, 𝑅) = 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Now we consider the general case. From what has been proved previously, it follows that
for 𝑁1 sufficiently large, we have:
𝜌𝐽 (𝐷𝑁1 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅/𝐽, 𝜎/𝐽).
Since 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) maps surjectively onto 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅/𝐽, 𝜎/𝐽), we obtain
𝐷𝑁1 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐽).
Now, we prove that
𝐷𝑖 (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐽)) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐷𝑖 (𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐽)).
As before, it suffices to verify the fact that 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐷𝑖+1 (𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐽)) is normal in
𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐽) and contains the commutators of elements from 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) ∪
𝐷𝑖 (𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐽)). Both claims follow from Lemma 1 and the fact that by Lemma 2 we have
𝐸(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐽) 6 𝐸(Φ, 𝐼 + ∩ 𝐼 − ) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Using Lemmas 3 and 2 once again, we deduce that for a large 𝑁2 2 we have
𝐷𝑁2 (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐽)) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐸(Φ, 𝑅, 𝐽) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)𝐸(Φ, 𝐼 + ∩ 𝐼 − ) =
= 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
It remains to set 𝑁 = 𝑁1 + 𝑁2 .



Lemma 19. The subgroup 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) is normal in 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Proof. For a finitely generated ring, the statement follows from Lemma 18, and every ring
is an inductive limit of its finitely generated subrings.

Proposition 1. We have the identity
𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) = Tran(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)).

Proof. Obviously, the right-hand side is contained in the left-hand side. We prove the
inverse inclusion. As in the previous lemma, without loss of generality we may assume
that the ring 𝑅 is finitely generated.
14

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
Then by Lemma 18, we have:
Tran(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 Tran(𝐷𝑁 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), 𝐷𝑁 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) =
= Tran(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)).
It remains to prove that if 𝑔 ∈ Tran(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)), then the same is true
for 𝑔 −1 .
First, if 𝑔 ∈ Tran(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)), then for every 𝑘 ∈ N we have 𝑔 𝑘 ∈
Tran(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)).
Let 𝑔̃︀ be the operator on the space of matrices 𝑀 (Λ) given by:
𝑔̃︀ : 𝑀 (Λ) → 𝑀 (Λ)
𝑚 ↦→ 𝑔𝑚𝑔 −1 .
From the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, it follows that the operator 𝑔̃︀−1 is a polynomial of 𝑔.
̃︀
Set
𝐿 = {𝑚 ∈ 𝑀 (Λ) : ∀𝜆 ̸= 𝜆0 𝑚𝜆0 ,𝜆 ∈ 𝐼 + & 𝑚𝜆,𝜆0 ∈ 𝐼 − }.
Since all operators 𝑔̃︀𝑘 preserve 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), all polynomials of 𝑔̃︀ map 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) to 𝐿.
Since
𝐿 ∩ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) = 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎),
we obtain
𝑔 −1 ∈ Tran(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 Tran(𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)).

The idea to use the nilpotent structure 𝐾1 1 for the computation of normalisers was
suggested by A. Stepanov in [31].
7. The proof of Theorem 2 and its corollary
Proof. From Proposition 1 it follows that 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) consist exactly of elements
𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) such that the group 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) preserves the line spanned by the covector
𝑔𝜆0 ,* modulo 𝐼 + , and preserves the line spanned by the vector (𝑔 −1 )*,𝜆0 modulo 𝐼 − . Since
the group 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) is perfect, the preservation of lines implies the preservation of the
vector and covector themselves. By writing out the meaning of this preservation for the
generators of the group 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) in terms of matrices, we obtain Theorem 2.

To obtain the corollary we are interested in, we need the following two lemmas.
Lemma 20. In the cases of the second type, for any 𝜆 ∈ Λ the weight −𝜆 also belongs to
Λ, and there exists 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅)-invariant bilinear form on the module 𝑉 given by
(︃

𝜆∈Λ

𝜆∈Λ

15

p. gvozdevsky
Proof. The fact that −𝜆0 ∈ Λ has already been mentioned. Thus, the first statement
follows from the fact that 𝑊 (Φ) acts transitively on weights. Next, consider the dual
representation 𝑉 * and its basis {(𝑣 𝜆 )* } that is dual to the basis {𝑣 𝜆 }. Then the vector
(𝑣 𝜆 )* is a weight vector with the weight −𝜆. Therefore, the dual representation has the
same set of weights; hence there is an isomorphism between 𝑉 and 𝑉 * given by
̃︀
ℎ : 𝑉 → 𝑉 *,
𝑣 𝜆 ↦→ ±(𝑣 −𝜆 )* ,
which is the same as an invariant bilinear form.



Note that for the case of 𝐸7 such a form was written out explicitly in [16].
Lemma 21. In the cases of the second type, there exists a quadratic form on the module 𝑉 :
(︃
)︃
∑︁
∑︁
𝑞
𝑥𝜆 𝑣 𝜆 =
𝑞𝜇,𝜈 𝑥𝜇 𝑥𝜈 ,
𝜆∈Λ

(where (𝜇, 𝜈) runs over the set of nonordered pairs of weights) that satisfies the following
conditions:
(1) 𝑞(𝑣) = 0 for any vector 𝑣 from the orbit of the highest weight vector (i.e., for
𝑣 = 𝑔*,𝜆0 for any 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅); since the Weyl group acts transitively, the vectors
𝑣 = 𝑔*,𝜆 for the other weights 𝜆 also belong to that orbit);
(2) 𝑞𝜆0 ,−𝜆0 = ±1.
In [25], such equations on the orbit of the highest weight vector were called 𝜋-equations.
Proof. Let 𝜇1 ,𝜇2 ,. . .,𝜇𝑘 be the shortest path in the weight graph such that 𝜇1 ∈ Λ2 and
𝜇𝑘 = −𝜆0 . Then 𝛾𝑖 = 𝜇𝑖 − 𝜇𝑖+1 ∈ Φ and 𝑑(𝜇𝑖 , −𝜆0 ) = 𝑘 − 𝑖.
We will prove by induction on 𝑖 that there exists a quadratic form

∑︁

where (𝜇, 𝜈) runs over the set of nonordered pairs of weights such that 𝑑(𝜇, −𝜆0 ) > 𝑘 − 𝑖
and 𝑑(𝜈, −𝜆0 ) > 𝑘 − 𝑖, that satisfies the following conditions:
(1) 𝑞 (𝑖) (𝑣) = 0for any vector 𝑣 from the orbit of the highest weight vector;
(𝑖)
(2) 𝑞𝜆0 ,𝜇𝑖 = ±1.
The base of induction, 𝑖 = 1 follows from [11]. Theorem 2 of that paper implies that,
since 𝑑(𝜆0 , 𝜇1 ) = 2, the set
Ω(𝜆0 , 𝜇1 ) = {𝜈 ∈ Λ : 𝑑(𝜈, 𝜆0 ) = 𝑑(𝜈, 𝜇1 ) = 1} ∪ {𝜆0 , 𝜇1 } ⊆ Λ1 ∪ {𝜆0 , 𝜇1 }
is a square3. Hence the vectors from the orbit of the highest weight vector satisfy the
corresponding square equation, which has the required shape. It only remains to observe
that the weights from Λ1 and the weight 𝜆0 are at a distance of at least 𝑘 from the weight
−𝜆0 in the weight graph. Indeed, otherwise the corresponding path goes through Λ2 (by
3A

subset Ω ⊆ Λ is called a square, if |Ω| > 4, and for any 𝜆 ∈ Ω exactly one of the differences
{𝜆 − 𝜇 : 𝜇 ∈ Ω ∖ {𝜆}} is NOT a root.
16

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
Lemma 5, every root has coefficient of 𝛼(1) not greater than one in absolute value; hence
every vertex in the path is either in the same component as the previous one, or in the
adjacent component; in other words, the path cannot jump through Λ2 ), and we get a
shorter path to Λ2 .
Now we do the induction step from 𝑖 to 𝑖 + 1. Set
𝑞 (𝑖+1) (𝑣) = 𝑞 (𝑖) (𝑥𝛾𝑖 (1)𝑣).
After this transformation, the minimal distance from a weight participating in the formula
to the weight −𝜆0 decreases at most by 1. Obviously, the new form still annihilates the
vectors from the orbit of the highest weight vector. Since 𝑑(𝜇𝑖+1 , −𝜆0 ) = 𝑘 − 𝑖 − 1, the
weight 𝜇𝑖+1 does not participate in the formula for 𝑞 (𝑖) ; hence the monomial 𝑥𝜆0 𝑥𝜇𝑖 of the
form 𝑞 (𝑖) s the only one that contributes to the coefficient of 𝑥𝜆0 𝑥𝜇𝑖+1 in the form 𝑞 (𝑖+1) .
Therefore, this coefficient is equal to ±1.

Corollary 2. (to Theorem 2) Let 𝑅 be a finitely generated ring, and let 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ) be
a pair of ideals of 𝑅. Then there exists a natural number 𝑁 such that
𝐷𝑁 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) = 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Proof. In the cases of the first type, the statement follows from Theorem 2 and Lemma 18.
We consider the case of the second type.
By Lemma 18, it suffices to prove the inclusion
[︀
]︀
𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) , 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
We prove the inclusion
[︀
]︀
𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) , 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝑅, 𝐼 − )),
The proof of the inclusion into 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)) is similar (the form 𝑞 from Lemma 21
should be transferred to the dual representation via the isomorphism described in
Lemma 20).
Replacing the ring by its quotient 𝑅/𝐼 − , we may assume that 𝐼 − = (0). Therefore, we
need to prove the inclusion
[︀
]︀
𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) , 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 𝑃 .
Since the ring 𝑅 is finitely generated, it is Noetherian; hence it is a direct product of
rings with connected spectra. Thus, without loss of generality, we may assume that the
spectrum of 𝑅 is connected.
Case 1. 𝐼 + ̸= (0).
We claim that in this case, even a stronger inclusion holds:
𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) 6 𝑃 .
Indeed, let 𝑔 ∈ 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)). Then 𝑔 −1 ∈ 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)), and by Theorem 2 we have
𝑔𝜆,𝜆0 ∈ 𝐼 − = (0) ∀𝜆 ∈ Λ ∖ {𝜆0 , −𝜆0 }.
17

p. gvozdevsky
Next, consider the form 𝑞 from Lemma 21. Since it annihilates the vectors from the
orbit of the highest weight vector, the coefficients 𝑞𝜆,𝜆 (= 𝑞(𝑣 𝜆 )) vanish; hence, using that
𝑔*,𝜆0 = 𝑔𝜆,𝜆0 𝑣 𝜆0 + 𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 𝑣 −𝜆0 , we obtain
𝑔𝜆,𝜆0 𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 = ±𝑞(𝑔*,𝜆0 ) = 0.
The pair 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆0 ,𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 is unimodular. Hence every prime ideal of the ring 𝑅 contains exactly
one of the elements 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆0 and 𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 . Since the spectrum of the ring 𝑅 is connected, one
of those elements is invertible, and the other (since 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆0 𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 = 0) is equal to zero. By
Theorem 2 we have the inclusion
𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 𝐼 + ⊆ 𝐼 − = 0.
Hence the element 𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 is not invertible, i.e., it is equal to zero. Therefore, 𝑔 ∈ 𝑃 .
Case 2. 𝐼 + = (0).
First we assume that 𝑔 ∈ 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)). Then 𝑔 −1 ∈ 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)),
and by Theorem 2 we have:
𝑔𝜆,𝜆0 ∈ 𝐼 − = (0) ∀𝜆 ∈ Λ ∖ {𝜆0 , −𝜆0 },
𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆 ∈ 𝐼 + = (0) ∀𝜆 ∈ Λ ∖ {𝜆0 , −𝜆0 }.
The same is true for 𝑔 −1 ; hence for 𝜆 ∈ Λ ∖ {𝜆0 , −𝜆0 }, we have
𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆 = ℎ(𝑔*,𝜆 , 𝑣 𝜆0 ) = ℎ(𝑔𝑣 𝜆 , 𝑣 𝜆0 ) = ℎ(𝑣 𝜆 , 𝑔 −1 𝑣 𝜆0 ) = (𝑔 −1 )−𝜆,𝜆0 = 0,
where ℎ is a form occurring in Lemma 20. Similarly, we deduce that 𝑔𝜆,−𝜆0 = 0. Therefore,
the submodule generated by the vectors 𝑣 𝜆0 and 𝑣 −𝜆0 , is invariant with respect to the
action of the group 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)), and the element 𝑔 acts on it by the following
matrix:
(︂
)︂
𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆0 𝑔𝜆0 ,−𝜆0
.
𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 𝑔−𝜆0 ,−𝜆0
Arguing as in the first case, we see that each column and each row of this matrix contain
an invertible entry and a zero entry. Therefore, this matrix can be of one of the following
shapes:
(︂
)︂ (︂
)︂
𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆0

If
[︀
]︀
𝑔 ∈ 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) , 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) ,
then the matrix has the first shape, i.e. 𝑔−𝜆0 ,𝜆0 = 0 and 𝑔 ∈ 𝑃 .

Let R(−) be the smallest closed subscheme (over Z) in 𝐺(Φ, −), such that for any 𝑅
and any ℎ ∈ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) we have
𝑥𝛼1 (1)ℎ ∈ R(𝑅).
Obviously, one can replace 𝛼1 with any other root because all elements 𝑥𝛼 (1) are conjugate by elements of the Weyl group.
18

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
The elements of R(𝑅) are what we call the root type elements.
Let Z[𝐺] be the ring of regular functions on the scheme 𝐺(Φ, −), and let Z[R] be the
ring of regular functions on the scheme R(−). By definition, the second ring is a quotient
of the first one. However, using the following lemma, we will also view the ring Z[R] as a
subring of Z[𝐺].
We denote by 𝑔gen ∈ 𝐺(Φ, Z[𝐺]) and 𝑟gen ∈ R(Z[R]) the generic elements of the corresponding schemes.
Lemma 22. There exists an injective map 𝑖 : 𝑍[R] → Z[𝐺] such that 𝑖(𝑟gen ) = 𝑥𝛼1 (1)𝑔gen .
Proof. The collection of maps
𝐺(Φ, 𝑅) → R(𝑅)
𝑔 ↦→ 𝑥𝛼1 (1)𝑔
gives a morphism of schemes 𝐺(Φ, −) → R(−). Take 𝑖 to be the corresponding homomorphism of rings of regular functions. The relation 𝑖(𝑟gen ) = 𝑥𝛼1 (1)𝑔gen is true in this case by
definition. It remains to prove that the homomorphism 𝑖 is injective.
̃︀
Let 𝐼 = Ker 𝑖, and let R(−)
be the subscheme of R(−) determined by the ideal 𝐼. Then
̃︀
by the definition of 𝐼 we have 𝑥𝛼1 (1)𝑔gen ∈ R(Z[𝐺]).
Hence by the universal property of
ℎ
̃︀
𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑛 , we have 𝑥𝛼1 (1) ∈ R(𝑅). for any ring 𝑅 and any ℎ ∈ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅). However, R(−) ) is the
̃︀
smallest subscheme with this property. Hence R(−)
coincides with R(−), i.e. 𝐼 = 0. 
We provide several important examples of root type elements.
Lemma 23. Let 𝑅 be a commutative ring; then the following holds
(1) 𝑥𝛼 (𝑡) ∈ R(𝑅) for any 𝛼 ∈ Φ, 𝑡 ∈ 𝑅. In particular, the identity element is a root
type element.
(2) An element conjugate to a root type element is a root type element.
(3) Let 𝛼,𝛽 ∈ Φ be such that ∠(𝛼, 𝛽) = 𝜋3 . Then 𝑥𝛼 (𝜉)𝑥𝛽 (𝜁) ∈ R(𝑅).
Proof.

(1) It suffices to consider the case where 𝑡 is a free variable (𝑅 = Z[𝑡]). We
need to check that the element 𝑥𝛼 (𝑡) satisfies certain equations. Since the ring
Z[𝑡] is embeded into the ring Z[𝑡, 𝑡−1 ], we can replace one with another. In the
group 𝐺(Φ, Z[𝑡, 𝑡−1 ]) the element 𝑥𝛼 (𝑡) is conjugate to the element 𝑥𝛼1 (1); hence it
satisfies those equations.
(2) It suffices to consider the element (𝑟gen )𝑔gen ∈ 𝐺(Φ, Z[R] ⊗Z Z[𝐺]). As before, it
suffices to map our ring to another ring injectively with the image of the element 𝑟gen
(and hence of the element (𝑟gen )𝑔gen ) being conjugate to 𝑥𝛼1 (1). Those requirements
are satisfied if we take the map
𝑖 ⊗ Z[𝐺] : Z[R] ⊗Z Z[𝐺] → Z[𝐺] ⊗Z Z[𝐺],
where 𝑖 is from Lemma 22. This map is injective because 𝑖 is injective, and the
scheme 𝐺(Φ, −) is flat, i.e Z[𝐺] is a flat Z-module.

Applying the corresponding map from SL(3, 𝑅) to 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅), we see that the element
𝑥𝛼 (𝜉)𝑥𝛽 (𝜁) is conjugate to the element 𝑥𝛽 (𝜁); hence it is conjugate to 𝑥𝛼1 (1).

Lemma 24. Every root type element is an exponential of a certain element of the Lie
algebra of the group 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅), Moreover, in terms of matrices in the representation 𝑉
taking the exponential is addition of the identity matrix.
Proof. It suffices to prove the statement for the element 𝑟gen ∈ R(Z[R]) .We view Z[R]
as a subring in Z[𝐺] (Lemma 22). Over Z[𝐺], the element 𝑟gen becomes conjugate to the
element 𝑥𝛼1 (1); hence the statement is true for it (the second part holds true because
the representation is minuscule). It remains to note that after subtraction of the identity
matrix, all the entries remain in the ring Z[R]; hence the corresponding element of the Lie
algebra is defined over Z[R].

Lemma 25. Let 𝑔 ∈ R(𝑅). Then the following holds true:
(1) 𝑔𝜆,𝜇 = 0 for any pair of weights 𝜆, 𝜇 such that 𝑑(𝜆, 𝜇) > 2.
(2) 𝑔𝜆,𝜇 = ±𝑔𝜌,𝜎 for any 𝜆, 𝜇, 𝜌, 𝜎 ∈ Λ such that 𝑑(𝜆, 𝜇) = 𝑑(𝜌, 𝜎) = 1 and 𝜆−𝜇 = 𝜌−𝜎.
Proof. The two statements follow from Lemma 24 and the Cartan decomposition.

9. Extraction of elementary root elements
We need the following obvious lemma.
Lemma 26. Let 𝜆 ∈ Λ and 𝛼,𝛽1 ,. . .,𝛽𝑘 ∈ Φ be such that 𝜆 + 𝛼 ∈

all 𝑖. Then for any 𝜁,𝜉1 ,𝜉𝑘 ∈ 𝑅 we have

9.1. Extraction from the subgroups 𝑃 and 𝑃 − . The proposition below follows from
the paper [29]. However, in our case the proof is quite simple, so we give it here.
Proposition 2. Let 𝐻 H be an overgroup for 𝐸(∆, 𝑅).
(1) Let 𝐼 + E 𝑅 be such that (𝐻 ∩ 𝑃 ) ∖ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 0)) ̸= ∅. Then 𝐻 contains an
element 𝑥𝛼 (𝜉), where 𝛼 ∈ Ω+ and 𝜉 ∈ 𝑅 ∖ 𝐼 + .
(2) The same is true for 𝑃 − and Ω− .
20

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
Proof. We prove Item 1, the proof of the second item is similar.
Suppose the contrary; then the first component of lev(𝐻) is contained in 𝐼 + . Without loss of generality, we may assume that it is equal to 𝐼 + (if we replace 𝐼 + with this
component, then the assumption remains true).
Let 𝑔 ∈ (𝐻 ∩ 𝑃 ) ∖ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 0)), then 𝑔 = 𝑔1 𝑔2 , where 𝑔1 ∈ 𝑈 and 𝑔2 ∈ 𝐿. Let
𝑔1 =

𝑙
∏︁

where 𝛽𝑖′ ∈ Ω+ .

𝑥𝛽𝑖′ (𝜉𝑖 ),

𝑖=1

Since 𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 0)), without loss of generality we may assume that 𝜉1 ∈
/ 𝐼 +.
′
Take 𝛼 ∈ ∆ such that 𝛽1 + 𝛼 ∈ Φ (Lemma 8). Then we have:
[𝑔1 , 𝑥𝛼 (1)] = [𝑔𝑔2−1 , 𝑥𝛼 (1)] = 𝑔 [𝑔2−1 , 𝑥𝛼 (1)] · [𝑔, 𝑥𝛼 (1)] ∈ 𝐻,
because 𝑔, 𝑥𝛼 (1) ∈ 𝐻, and
[𝑔2−1 , 𝑥𝛼 (1)] ∈ [𝐿, 𝐸(∆, 𝑅)] = [𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (0, 0)), 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (0, 0))] = 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (0, 0)) 6 𝐻.
On the other hand, by Lemma 26 we get:
𝑙
∏︁
[𝑔1 , 𝑥𝛼 (1)] =
[𝑥𝛽𝑖′ (𝜉𝑖 ), 𝑥𝛼 (1)].
𝑖=1

Without loss of generality, we may assume that the first 𝑘 commutators and only they are
nontrivial, i.e.,
𝑘
∏︁
[𝑔1 , 𝑥𝛼 (1)] =
𝑥𝛽𝑖 (±𝜉𝑖 ),
where 𝛽𝑖 = 𝛽𝑖′ + 𝛼.
𝑖=1

Therefore, 𝐻 contains an element of the form
𝑘

+

where 𝛽𝑖 ∈ Ω and 𝜉1 ∈
/ 𝐼 . Among all such elements of 𝐻 consider those that have the
smallest 𝑘, and among them, take the one with the greatest sum of the 𝛽𝑖 . Then none
of the 𝜉𝑖 belongs to 𝐼 + (otherwise, the corresponding root elements belong to 𝐻, and we
can remove them to reduce 𝑘), and all the 𝛽𝑖 are distinct (otherwise we reduce 𝑘, by using
additivity). If at least one of the 𝛽𝑖 is not the maximal root, then we can take a simple
root 𝛼𝑚 such that 𝛽𝑖 + 𝛼𝑚 ∈ Φ (𝛼𝑚 ̸= 𝛼(1) because 𝛽𝑖 ∈ Ω+ ; hence 𝛼𝑚 ∈ ∆). In this case,
we see that the element
[︃ 𝑘
]︃
∏︁
𝑥𝛽𝑖 (𝜉1 ), 𝑥𝛼𝑚 (1) ∈ 𝐻
𝑖=1

has the same form by Lemma 26. Furthermore, we either reduce 𝑘, or retain 𝑘 the same,
but increase the sum of 𝛽𝑖 , which contradicts our choice
Therefore, our element is 𝑥𝛿 (𝜉1 ), where 𝛿 is the maximal root, and 𝜉1 ∈
/ 𝐼 +.

9.2. Extraction from the subgroups 𝑃𝜆 and 𝑃𝜆− .
Lemma 27. Let 𝐻 be an overgroup of 𝐸(∆, 𝑅), of level 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ), and let 𝜆1 ∈ Λ1 .
Then the following inclusion holds:
𝐻 ∩ 𝑈𝜆1 ⊆ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Proof. Let 𝑔 ∈ 𝐻 ∩ 𝑈𝜆1 ∖ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Case 1. 𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).
In this case, we have
𝑔=

𝜉1 ∈

By Item 3 of Lemma 11 there exists 𝛾 ∈ ∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 such that 𝛽1 + 𝛾 ∈ Φ (hence, in fact,
𝛽1 + 𝛾 ∈ Σ+

Without loss of generality, we may assume that the first 𝑘 commutators and only they are

where all the 𝛽𝑖 belong to Σ𝜆1 ⊔ Σ𝜆1 (because by Item 1 of Lemma 11 𝛽0′ is the only element

𝜆1 ); next, 𝛽1 ∈ Σ𝜆1 and 𝜉1 ∈

Similarly,

However, now we have 𝜉𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 + (1 6 𝑖 6 𝑙), but 𝜉0 ∈

first one belong to 𝐻; hence we deduce that 𝑥𝛽0′ (𝜉0 ) ∈ 𝐻, which contradicts the fact that

Lemma 28. Let 𝐼 + E 𝑅, 𝜆1 ∈ Λ1 , and let
𝑔 ∈ (𝑃𝜆1 ∩ R(𝑅)) ∖ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)),
Then there exists 𝛾 ∈ (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ (see Item (4) of Lemma 11) such that
𝑔𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔 −1 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).
22

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
Proof. First, we prove the following statement:
𝑔𝐸((∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ , 𝑅)𝑔 −1 ̸⊆ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).
Suppose the contrary; then our assumption means exactly that the group
𝐸((∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ , 𝑅) stabilizes the line spanned by the covector 𝑔𝜆0 * , modulo 𝐼 + . Since this
group is perfect (because (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ is an irreducible system distinct from 𝐴1 ), it must
stabilize the covector itself.
Further, since 𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)), there exists 𝜇 ∈ Λ ∖ {𝜆0 } such that 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇 ∈
/ 𝐼 +.
By Lemma 25 𝜇 ∈ Λ1 , and since 𝑔 ∈ 𝑃𝜆1 , we see that 𝜇 ̸= 𝜆1 . Take 𝜈 from Item 4 of
Lemma 11, and set 𝛾
̃︀ = 𝜇 − 𝜈 ∈ (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ .
Since the element 𝑔𝜆0 * stabilizes the covector 𝑥𝛾̃︀ (1) we obtain the following congruence
(𝑔𝑥𝛾̃︀ (1))𝜆0 ,𝜈 ≡ 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜈

mod 𝐼 + .

However, we also have the identity
(𝑔𝑥𝛾̃︀ (1))𝜆0 ,𝜈 = 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜈 ± 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇 .
+

Hence 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇 ∈ 𝐼 , which contradict the choice of 𝜇.
Therefore, for some 𝛾 ∈ (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ and some 𝑡 ∈ 𝑅, we have
𝑔𝑥𝛾 (𝑡)𝑔 −1 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).
We also know that
𝑔𝑥𝛾 (𝑡)𝑔 −1 = 𝑒 + 𝑡(𝑔𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔 −1 − 𝑒),
Hence we obtain
𝑔𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔 −1 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).

Lemma 29. Let 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ) be the pair of ideals of the ring 𝑅, let 𝜆1 ∈ Λ1 , and let
𝑔 ∈ (𝐿𝜆1 ∩ R(𝑅)) ∖ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Then there exists 𝛾 ∈ Σ0𝜆1 such that 𝑔 −1 𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Proof. Case 1. 𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝑅, 𝐼 − )).
In this case, there exists a weight 𝜇 such that 𝑔𝜇,𝜆0 ∈
/ 𝐼 − . By Item 1 of Lemma 25,
𝜇 ∈ Λ1 , and, since 𝑔 ∈ 𝐿𝜆1 , we see that 𝜇 ̸= 𝜆1 . Next, let 𝑤 ∈ 𝑊 (Φ) be the reflection with
respect to 𝜆0 − 𝜆1 . Note that the roots 𝜆0 − 𝜇 and 𝜆0 − 𝜆1 are not orthogonal. Indeed,
otherwise we obtain:
𝜆0 − 𝜇 = 𝑤(𝜆0 − 𝜇) = 𝜆1 − 𝑤(𝜇).
Then, applying Item 2 of Lemma 25 and the fact that 𝑔 ∈ 𝐿𝜆1 , we deduce that 𝑔𝜇,𝜆0 =
𝑔𝑤(𝜇),𝜆1 = 0.
Therefore, their inner product should be equal to one (it cannot be equal to minus one
because they both belong to Ω+ ), and we can set
𝛾 = 𝜆1 − 𝜇 = (𝜆0 − 𝜇) − (𝜆0 − 𝜆1 ) ∈ Φ.
By definition, 𝛾 ∈ Σ𝜆1 , and since 𝜇 ∈ Λ1 , we have 𝛾 ∈ Σ0𝜆1 . We show that it satisfies the
requirement.
23

p. gvozdevsky
Indeed, the column (𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔)*,𝜆0 is not a multiple of the column 𝑔*,𝜆0 modulo 𝐼 − , because
𝑔𝜆1 ,𝜆0 = 0, but (𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔)𝜆1 ,𝜆0 ∈
/ 𝐼 − . This means exactly that
𝑔 −1 𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝑅, 𝐼 − )).
Case 2. 𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).
In this case 𝑔 −1 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)), i.e., the set
𝑀 = {𝜇 ∈ Λ1 : 𝑔𝜆−1

Multiplying the corresponding 𝜀, we get transitivity; antireflexivity follows by the definition of 𝑀 .
Let 𝜇 ∈ 𝑀 be a maximal element (i.e., such that there are no arrows from it). As in the
first case, we prove that the root 𝛼 = 𝜆0 − 𝜇has the inner product with 𝜆0 − 𝜆1 equal to
one. Take 𝛾 from item (5) of Lemma 11. Then 𝛼 + 𝛾 ∈ Ω+ , and by Lemma 9 we have:
𝜈 = 𝜇 − 𝛾 = 𝜆0 − (𝛼 + 𝛾) ∈ Λ.
Clearly, 𝜈 ∈ Λ1 .
Assume that 𝑔 −1 𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), i.e., the element 𝑥𝛾 (1) stabilises the line spanned
by the covector 𝑔𝜆−1
modulo 𝐼 + . Thus, it multiplies this covector by a scalar, which we
0 ,*
denote by(1 + 𝜀) ∈ 𝑅/𝐼 + .
We show that 𝜈 ∈ 𝑀 and 𝜇 → 𝜈. If we do this, then we get a contradiction.

Suppose the contrary; then the first component of lev(𝐻)) is contained in 𝐼 + . Without
loss of generality, we may assume that it is equal to 𝐼 + (if we replace 𝐼 + with this component, then the assumption remains true). Let 𝐼 − be the second component of lev(𝐻) and
let 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ).
By Lemma 28 the element 𝑔1 = 𝑔𝑥𝛾1 (1)𝑔 −1 satisfies the same assumptions as the element
𝑔 for a suitable 𝛾1 ∈ (∆ ∩ ∆𝜆1 )′ .
Let 𝑔 = 𝑢𝑙 and 𝑔1 = 𝑢1 𝑙1 , where 𝑙, 𝑙1 ∈ 𝐿𝜆1 and 𝑢, 𝑢1 ∈ 𝑈𝜆1 . Then, taking the projection
to 𝐿𝜆1 in the definition of 𝑔1 , we obtain
𝑙1 = 𝑙−1 𝑥𝛾1 (1)𝑙 ∈ R(𝑅).
Case 1. 𝑙1 ∈

In this case, applying Lemma 29, we obtain the element
ℎ = 𝑙1−1 𝑥𝛾2 (1)𝑙1 ∈ 𝑈𝜆1 ∖ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Next, since the group 𝑈𝜆1 is Abelian, we obtain ℎ = 𝑔1−1 𝑥𝛾2 (1)𝑔1 ∈ 𝐻. Applying Lemma 27,
we get a contradiction.
Case 2. 𝑙1 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Applying Lemma 28 once again, we obtain the element 𝑔2 = 𝑔1 𝑥𝛾2 (1)𝑔1−1 that satisfies
the same assumptions as the initial element 𝑔. Let 𝑔2 = 𝑢2 𝑙2 . As for the element 𝑔1 , we
see that 𝑙2 = 𝑙1 𝑥𝛾2 (1)𝑙1−1 . By assumption, we have 𝑙1 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎); hence by Lemma 19,
we have
𝑙2 ∈ 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) ⊆ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Hence 𝑢2 ∈ 𝐻 ∖ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎), and we can apply Lemma 27 again.

9.3. Extraction from a congruence subgroup of a nilpotent level.
Lemma 30. Let 𝑆 be a commutative ring, and let 𝐼 E 𝑆 be an ideal such that the following
holds true.
(1) 𝐼 2 = 0
(2) The idea 𝐼 is finitely generated.
(3) As an Abelian group, 𝑆 = Z ⊕ 𝐼, where (1, 0) is the identity element of 𝑆.
(4) The ideal 𝐼 is torsion free as an Abelian group.
Further, let 𝜉 ∈ 𝐼 ∖ {0}. Then there exists a ring homomorphism
𝜙 : 𝑆 → C[𝜀]/(𝜀2 )

𝑆 ≃ Z[𝜀]/(𝜀2 ),

Lemma 31. Let 𝑅 be an arbitrary commutative ring, and let B E 𝑅 be an ideal such that
B2 = 0. Next, let
𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, B).
Then 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇0 = 0 for any pair of weights 𝜆0 , 𝜇0 such that 𝑑(𝜆0 , 𝜇0 ) > 2.
Proof. Consider the ring
𝑆̃︀ = Z[{𝑎𝜆,𝜇 }𝜆,𝜇∈Λ ]/⟨{𝑎𝜆,𝜇 𝑎𝜆′ ,𝜇′ : 𝜆, 𝜇, 𝜆′ , 𝜇′ ∈ Λ}⟩,
and the ideal 𝐼̃︀ E 𝑆̃︀ generated by all the 𝑎𝜆𝜇 . Clearly, they satisfy the assumptions in the

Set 𝑆 = Z[𝐺]/𝐼aug
𝜋 : 𝑆̃︀ → 𝑆
𝑎𝜆,𝜇 ↦→ (𝑔gen )𝜆,𝜇 − 𝛿𝜆,𝜇 .
We prove that the pair 𝑆, 𝐼 satisfies the assumptions in the previous lemma. The first two
conditions are obvious, the third one is fulfilled because the augmentation homomorphism
splits; it remains to show that 𝐼 is torsion free as an Abelian group. The scheme 𝐺(Φ, −)
is smooth, the homomorphism 𝜋 is surjective, and (Ker 𝜋)2 = 0; hence the reduction
homomorphism
̃︀ → 𝐺(Φ, 𝑆)
𝜋* : 𝐺(Φ, 𝑆)
is surjective (see [24, §4, Item 4.6], set 𝑘 = Z). Hence there exists a matrix
̃︀
𝑒 + (𝑏𝜆,𝜇 ) ∈ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑆)
̃︀ hence the ring homomorphism
such that 𝜋(𝛿𝜆,𝜇 + 𝑏𝜆,𝜇 ) = (𝑔gen )𝜆,𝜇 . In particular, 𝑏𝜆,𝜇 ∈ 𝐼;
𝑖 : 𝑆 → 𝑆̃︀
(𝑔gen )𝜆,𝜇 ↦→ 𝑏𝜆,𝜇 + 𝛿𝜆,𝜇 .
is well defined. Then the homomorphism of Abelian groups
𝑖| : 𝐼 → 𝐼̃︀
𝐼

is a right inverse to 𝜋|𝐼̃︀; hence 𝐼 is isomorphic to a direct summand of 𝐼̃︀ and, therefore, is
tortion free
The assumption implies that the ring homomorphism

is well defined.
Now let weights 𝜆0 ,𝜇0 be such that 𝑑(𝜆0 , 𝜇0 ) > 2. We prove that 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇0 = 0. To do this,
it suffices to prove that (𝑔gen )𝜆0 ,𝜇0 = 0. Suppose the contrary; then by the previous lemma,
there exists a ring homomorphism
𝜙 : 𝑆 → C[𝜀]/(𝜀2 )
such that 𝜙((𝑔gen )𝜆,𝜇 ) ̸= 0. The matrix 𝑔gen belongs to 𝐺(Φ, 𝑆, 𝐼). Since 𝐼 2 = 0, we see
that 𝜙(𝐼) belongs to the ideal generated by 𝜀; hence
𝜙* (𝑔gen ) ∈ 𝐺(Φ, C[𝜀]/(𝜀2 ), (𝜀)) = Lie(𝐺(Φ, −)C ).
This Lie algebra admits a Cartan decomposition, i.e., the matrix (𝜙(𝑎𝜆,𝜇 )) is a linear
combination of elementary root elements and diagonal elements of this algebra. Thus, since
𝑑(𝜆0 , 𝜇0 ) > 2, its entry 𝜙((𝑔gen )𝜆,𝜇 ) is equal to 0, which contradicts the choice of 𝜙.

0. By the previous lemma 𝜆1 ∈ Λ1 . Take 𝛼 ∈ ∆ such that 𝜆1 + 𝛼 = 𝜈 ∈ Λ1 (Lemma 12).
If we prove that
ℎ = 𝑔𝑥𝛼 (1)𝑔 −1 ∈ (𝐻 ∩ 𝑃𝜆1 ) ∖ 𝑃 − ,
then by Proposition 3, we are done.
We prove that the element 𝑥𝛼 (1) stabilizes the line spanned by the vector (𝑔 −1 )*,𝜆1 .
Indeed, we have:
{︃
(𝑔 −1 )𝜇,𝜆1
𝜇+𝛼∈
/ Φ,
−1
(𝑥𝛼 (1)(𝑔 )*,𝜆1 )𝜇 =

−1
(𝑔 )𝜇,𝜆1 ± (𝑔 )𝜇+𝛼,𝜆1
𝜇 + 𝛼 ∈ Φ.
Note that since 𝜆1 + 𝛼 ∈ Λ, in the second case, by Lemma 10
𝑑(𝜇 + 𝛼, 𝜆1 ) > 2; hence (𝑔 −1 )𝜇+𝛼,𝜆1 = 0 by the previous lemma.
{︃
(𝑔 −1 )𝜇,𝜆1
(𝑥𝛼 (1)(𝑔 −1 )*,𝜆1 )𝜇 =
(𝑔 −1 )𝜆1 ,𝜆1 ± (𝑔 −1 )𝜈,𝜆1

we have either 𝜇 = 𝜆1 or
Therefore,
𝜇 ̸= 𝜆1 ,
𝜇 = 𝜆1 .

Hence since B2 = 0, we obtain
𝑥𝛼 (1)(𝑔 −1 )*,𝜆1 = (𝑔 −1 )*,𝜆1 ± (𝑔 −1 )𝜈,𝜆1 𝑣 𝜆1 = (𝑔 −1 )*,𝜆1 (1 ± (𝑔 −1 )𝜈,𝜆1 ).
Thus ℎ ∈ 𝑃𝜆1 .
Finally, let 𝑤 be a row such that
𝑔𝜆0 ,* 𝑥𝛼 (1) = 𝑔𝜆0 ,* + 𝑤.

Then 𝑤𝜇 ∈ B for all 𝜇 ∈ Λ (note that 𝜆0 − 𝛼 ∈

𝑤𝜈 = ±𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ̸= 0. Then since 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, B), we obtain:
ℎ𝜆0 ,𝜈 = (𝑔𝜆0 ,* 𝑔 −1 + 𝑤𝑔 −1 )𝜈 = 0 + 𝑤𝜈 ̸= 0.
Thus ℎ ∈

10. An 𝐴2 -proof

The idea of the argument below is borrowed from [12].
Lemma 32. Let 𝑔 ∈ R(𝑅) and 𝜆1 ∈ Λ. For every pair of weights 𝜇,𝜈 ∈ Λ such that
𝑑(𝜆1 , 𝜇) = 𝑑(𝜆1 , 𝜈) = 𝑑(𝜇, 𝜈) = 1, set
𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) = 𝑥𝛼 (𝑐𝜇,𝛼 · 𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 )𝑥𝛽 (−𝑐𝜈,𝛽 · 𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 ),
where 𝛼 = 𝜆1 − 𝜇 and 𝛽 = 𝜆1 − 𝜈.
Then the following holds.
(1) The element 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) stabilises the column 𝑔*,𝜆1 .
(2) We have
𝑔 −1 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)𝑔 = 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) + [𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈), 𝑔]ring ,
where [·, ·]ring is a ring commutator of matrices.
Proof.

(1) We act by the element 𝑥𝛽 (−𝑐𝜈,𝛽 · 𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 ) on the column 𝑔*,𝜆1
{︃
𝑔𝜌,𝜆1
𝜌−𝛽 ∈
/ Λ,
(𝑥𝛽 (−𝑐𝜈,𝛽 · 𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 )𝑔*,𝜆1 )𝜌 =
𝑔𝜌,𝜆1 − 𝑐𝜌−𝛽,𝛽 𝑐𝜈,𝛽 · 𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 𝑔𝜌−𝛽,𝜆1 𝜌 − 𝛽 ∈ Λ.
Note that if the second case occurs, Lemma 10 shows that we have either 𝜌 = 𝜆1
or 𝑑(𝜌 − 𝛽, 𝜆1 ) > 2; hence by Lemma 25 𝑔𝜌−𝛽,𝜆1 = 0. Therefore, we have:
𝑥𝛽 (−𝑐𝜈,𝛽 · 𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 )𝑔*,𝜆1 = 𝑔*,𝜆1 − 𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 𝑣 𝜆1 .

Similarly, applying 𝑥𝛼 (𝑐𝜇,𝛼 · 𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 ) to the resulting column, we obtain the initial
column 𝑔*,𝜆1 .
(2) It suffices to consider the case where 𝑅 = Z[R] and 𝑔 = 𝑟gen . Since what we need to
prove is a polynomial identity, we may extend the ring up to Z[𝐺], using Lemma 22,
and then extend it up to Z[𝐺][ 21 ].
Let 𝑥
̃︀ = 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) − 𝑒 and 𝑟̃︀ = 𝑟gen − 𝑒 be the corresponding elements of the
Lie algebra (see Lemma 24). Here it should be noted that ∠(𝛼, 𝛽) = 𝜋3 because
𝛼 − 𝛽 = 𝜈 − 𝜇 ∈ Φ. Hence 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) ∈ R(𝑅) by Lemma 23. Then by Lemma 24, we
have the following identity:
1
−1
𝑟gen
𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)𝑟gen = 𝑒 + exp(− ad 𝑟)̃︀
̃︀ 𝑥 = 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) + [̃︀
𝑥, 𝑟]
̃︀ ring + (ad 𝑟)
̃︀ 2 𝑥
̃︀ = 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)+
2
1
+[𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈), 𝑟gen ]ring + (ad 𝑟)
̃︀ 2 𝑥.
̃︀
2
Next, note that for any element 𝑦 of our Lie algebra, we have (ad 𝑒𝛼1 )2 𝑦 = 𝜉𝑦 𝑒𝛼1 for
some 𝜉𝑦 ∈ 𝑅, where 𝑒𝛼1 = 𝑥𝛼1 (1) − 𝑒 is a root element. This relation is obtained

from the Cartan decomposition of the element 𝑦 by expanding (the only nonzero
term comes from the coefficient of 𝑒−𝛼1 ). Conjugating this relation by the element
𝑔gen , we obtain a similar statement for 𝑟gen . Therefore, we have the formula
−1
𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)𝑟gen = 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) + [𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈), 𝑟gen ]ring + 𝜉̃︀
𝑟
𝑟gen

(*)

for some 𝜉 ∈ Z[𝐺][ 21 ]. We claim that in fact, we have 𝜉 = 0. Indeed, let us compare
the 𝜆1 th columns of the left-hand and right-hand sides of (*). The first item implies
the formula
−1
(𝑟gen
𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)𝑟gen )*,𝜆1 = 𝑣𝜆1 ,

as well as the relation
(𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)𝑟gen )*,𝜆1 = (𝑟gen )*,𝜆1 .
Further, it is easy to see that the element 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) also stabilises the column 𝑣𝜆1 .
Hence 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)*,𝜆1 = 𝑣𝜆1 . Finally, calculating the product 𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) we see that the
matrix 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) acts on each row of the matrix 𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛 , without changing the entry in
the 𝜆1 th column (indeed, 𝜆1 − 𝛼 and 𝜆1 − 𝛽 belong to Λ; hence 𝜆1 + 𝛼 and 𝜆1 + 𝛽
do not belong to Λ, because the representation is minuscule), i.e., we have
(𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑛 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈))*,𝜆1 = (𝑟gen )*,𝜆1 .
Therefore, we obtain the identity:
𝑣𝜆1 = 𝑣𝜆1 + (𝑟gen )*,𝜆1 − (𝑟gen )*,𝜆1 + 𝜉̃︀
𝑟*,𝜆1 ,
i.e., 𝜉̃︀
𝑟*,𝜆1 = 0.
The ring Z[𝐺][ 12 ] has no zero divisors, and the column 𝑟̃︀*,𝜆1 is nonzero. Hence
𝜉 = 0, and (*) gives us what we need.

Lemma 33. Let 𝑔 ∈ R(𝑅) and 𝜆1 ∈ Λ. Let 𝜇 ∈ Λ be such that 𝑑(𝜆1 , 𝜇) = 1, and let 𝜉 ∈ 𝑅
be such that 𝜉𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 = 0. Then the element 𝑥𝛼 (𝜉), where 𝛼 = 𝜆1 − 𝜇, stabilises the column
𝑔*,𝜆1 .
Proof. We have
{︃
𝑔𝜌,𝜆1
(𝑥𝛼 (𝜉)𝑔*,𝜆1 )𝜌 =
𝑔𝜌,𝜆1 ± 𝜉𝑔𝜌−𝛼,𝜆1

𝜌−𝛼∈
/ Λ,
𝜌 − 𝛼 ∈ Λ,

moreover, if the second case occurs, Lemma 10 shows that either 𝜌 = 𝜆1 , or 𝑑(𝜌−𝛼, 𝜆1 ) > 2;
hence 𝑔𝜌−𝛼,𝜆1 = 0 by Lemma 25. Therefore, we obtain
𝑥𝛼 (𝜉)𝑔*,𝜆1 = 𝑔*,𝜆1 ± 𝜉𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 𝑣 𝜆1 = 𝑔*,𝜆1 .

29

p. gvozdevsky
We introduce some notation. For each element 𝑔 ∈ R(𝑅) and weight 𝜆1 ∈ Λ1 consider
the following four ideals of the ring 𝑅:
A(𝑔, 𝜆1 ) = ⟨{𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 : 𝜇 ∈ Λ1 ∖ {𝜆1 }}⟩,
B(𝑔, 𝜆1 ) = ⟨𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ⟩,
A′ (𝑔, 𝜆1 ) = ⟨{𝑔𝜆1 ,𝜇 : 𝜇 ∈ Λ1 ∖ {𝜆1 }}⟩,
B′ (𝑔, 𝜆1 ) = ⟨𝑔𝜆1 ,𝜆0 ⟩.
Proposition 5. Let 𝐻 be an overgroup of 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) of level 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ), let 𝑔 ∈ R(𝑅)∩𝐻,
and let 𝜆1 ∈ Λ1 . Then we have:
(1) A(𝑔, 𝜆1 )B(𝑔, 𝜆1 ) ⊆ 𝐼 + ;
(2) if 𝐼 + = 0, then (B(𝑔, 𝜆1 ))3 = (0);
(3) A′ (𝑔, 𝜆1 )B′ (𝑔, 𝜆1 ) ⊆ 𝐼 − ;
(4) if 𝐼 − = 0, then (B′ (𝑔, 𝜆1 ))3 = (0).
Proof.

(1) Let 𝜈 ∈ Λ1 ∖ {𝜆1 }, We prove that 𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ∈ 𝐼 + . It suffices to consider the
case where 𝑑(𝜈, 𝜆1 ) = 1 because otherwise 𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 = 0 by Lemma 25.
Take a weight 𝜇 from Item 2 of Lemma 12. Let 𝛼 = 𝜆1 − 𝜇, 𝛽 = 𝜆1 − 𝜈 and let
𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) be as in Lemma 32. Then this lemma implies that the element 𝑔 −1 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)𝑔
stabilises 𝑣 𝜆1 (i.e., belongs to 𝑃𝜆1 ).
By Lemma 23 this element belongs to R(𝑅). It also belongs to 𝐻 (indeed, since
𝜆1 , 𝜇, 𝜈 ∈ Λ1 , we have 𝛼, 𝛽 ∈ ∆; hence 𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈) ∈ 𝐻). If it does not belong
to 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)), then by Proposition 3 the group 𝐻 cannot be of level 𝜎.
Hence it belongs to 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)), and by Item 2 of Lemma 32 we obtain the
congruence
(𝑔𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈))𝜆0 ,𝜇 ≡ (𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)𝑔)𝜆0 ,𝜇 mod 𝐼 + .
(1)
We compute the left-hand side of the congruence (1). Note that 𝜇 − 𝛽 ∈
/ Λ, because
otherwise, by Lemma 10, the relation 𝜆1 + 𝛽 ∈ Λ, implies that either 𝑑(𝜆1 , 𝜇) > 2,
or 𝜇 = 𝜈, which contradicts the choice of 𝜇. Hence,
𝑔𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈)𝑣 𝜇 = 𝑔𝑥𝛼 (±𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 )𝑥𝛽 (±𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 )𝑣 𝜇 = 𝑔𝑥𝛼 (±𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 )𝑣 𝜇 = 𝑔(𝑣 𝜇 ± 𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 𝑣 𝜆1 ),
which implies that
(𝑔𝑥(𝜇, 𝜈))𝜆0 ,𝜇 = 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇 ± 𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 .
Now we compute the right-hand side of the congruence (1). Note that 𝜆0 − 𝛼 ∈
/Λ
because 𝛼 ∈ ∆. Hence,
(𝑥𝛼 (±𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 )𝑥𝛽 (±𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 )𝑔)𝜆0 ,𝜇 = (𝑥𝛽 (±𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 )𝑔)𝜆0 ,𝜇 .
Similarly, 𝜆0 − 𝛽 does not belong to Λ; hence we obtain
(𝑥𝛽 (±𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 )𝑔)𝜆0 ,𝜇 = 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇 .
Therefore, the congruence (1) tells us exactly that 𝑔𝜈,𝜆1 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ∈ 𝐼 + .
30

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
(2) We prove that (𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 )3 = 0.
Take a weight 𝜇 from Item 1 of Lemma 12. Put 𝛼 = 𝜆1 − 𝜇, and 𝑥 = 𝑥𝛼 (𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ).
By what we proved before, we have 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 𝑔𝜇,𝜆1 = 0. Then Lemma 33 implies that
the element 𝑔 −1 𝑥𝑔 stabilizes 𝑣 𝜆1 . It also belongs to 𝐻 ∩ R(𝑅). If it does not belong
to 𝑃 − (i.e., to 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (0, 𝑅))), , then by Proposition 3 the group 𝐻 cannot be
of level 𝜎 (because 𝐼 + = 0). Hence it belongs to 𝑃 − , i.e., the matrix 𝑥 stabilizes
the line spanned by the covector 𝑔𝜆−1
. Thus it multiplies this covector by a scalar,
0 ,*
which we denote by (1 + 𝜀). Then, first, we have:
(1 + 𝜀)(𝑔 −1 )𝜆0 ,𝜆1 = (𝑔 −1 )𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ,
i.e., 𝜀(𝑔 −1 )𝜆0 ,𝜆1 = 0. Second, we have:
(1 + 𝜀)(𝑔 −1 )𝜆0 ,𝜇 = (𝑔 −1 𝑥)𝜆0 ,𝜇 = (𝑔 −1 )𝜆0 ,𝜇 ± (𝑔 −1 )2𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ,
i.e., 𝜀(𝑔 −1 )𝜆0 ,𝜇 = ±(𝑔 −1 )2𝜆0 ,𝜆1 . Therefore, we obtain the identity
(𝑔 −1 )3𝜆0 ,𝜆1 = ±𝜀(𝑔 −1 )𝜆0 ,𝜇 (𝑔 −1 )𝜆0 ,𝜆1 = 0.
It remains to note that by Lemma 24, we have: (𝑔 −1 )𝜆0 ,𝜆1 = −𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 .
The proofs of Items 3 and 4 are similar.

Corollary 3. Let 𝐼 be an ideal of 𝑅, and let 𝐻 be an overgroup of 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) of level
𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ). Then for the level of 𝜌𝐼 (𝐻) as an overgroup of 𝐸 (∆, 𝑅/𝐼) we have:
lev(𝜌𝐼 (𝐻)) = (𝜌𝐼 (𝐼 + ), 𝜌𝐼 (𝐼 − )).

Proof. Obviously, the right-hand side is contained in the left-hand side, let us prove the
inverse inclusion.
Suppose the contrary. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the inclusion fails
for the first component, i.e., for some 𝑔 ∈ 𝐻, 𝜉 ∈ 𝑅/𝐼 such that 𝜉 ∈
/ 𝜌𝐼 (𝐼 + ), and 𝛼 ∈ Ω+
we have 𝜌𝐼 (𝑔) = 𝑥𝛼 (𝜉).
Let 𝜈 = 𝜆0 − 𝛼 ∈ Λ1 (Lemma 9). Take 𝛽 ∈ ∆ such that 𝛼 + 𝛽 ∈ Φ (Lemma 8). Then
𝛼 + 𝛽 ∈ Ω+ , and 𝜆1 = 𝜆0 − 𝛼 − 𝛽 ∈ Λ1 .
Set ℎ = (𝑥𝛽 (1))𝑔 . Clearly, we have ℎ ∈ 𝐻 ∩ R(𝑅). Next, we have
𝜌B (ℎ) = (𝑥𝛽 (1))𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) = 𝑥𝛽 (−1) · [𝑥𝛽 (1), 𝑥𝛼 (−𝜉)] = 𝑥𝛽 (−1)𝑥𝛼+𝛽 (±𝜉)
By the previous proposition, we have ℎ𝜈,𝜆1 ℎ𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ∈ 𝐼 + . Hence we have
𝜌B (ℎ)𝜈,𝜆1 𝜌B (ℎ)𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ∈ 𝜌𝐼 (𝐼 + ).
On the other hand, the following identity holds:
𝜌B (ℎ)𝑣 𝜆 = 𝑥𝛽 (−1)𝑥𝛼+𝛽 (±𝜉)𝑣 𝜆 = 𝑥𝛽 (−1)(𝑣 𝜆 ± 𝜉𝑣 𝜆+𝛼+𝛽 ) =
{︃

𝜆 + 𝛼 + 2𝛽 ∈ Λ.
31

p. gvozdevsky
In any case, we obtain 𝜌B (ℎ)𝜆+𝛽+𝛼,𝜆 = ±𝜉, and 𝜌B (ℎ)𝜆+𝛽,𝜆 = ±1. Hence 𝜉 ∈ 𝜌𝐼 (𝐼 + ),
which contradicts the assumption.

11. Root type elements in an overgroup
Lemma 34. Let 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ) be a pair of ideals, and let 𝑔 ∈ R(𝑅) ∖ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎). Then
there exists 𝛾 ∈ ∆ such that
𝑔𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔 −1 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Proof. Clearly, without loss of generality we may assume that 𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).
First we prove the following statement:
𝑔𝐸(∆, 𝑅)𝑔 −1 ̸⊆ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).
Suppose the contrary; then our assumption means exactly that the group 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) stabilizes the line spanned by the covector 𝑔𝜆0 * modulo 𝐼 + . Since this group is perfect, it must
stabilize the covector itself.
/ 𝐼 + . By
Further since 𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)), there exists 𝜇 ∈ Λ ∖ {𝜆0 } such that 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇 ∈
Lemma 25, we have 𝜇 ∈ Λ1 . Take 𝛾
̃︀ ∈ ∆ such that
𝜈 =𝜇+𝛾
̃︀ ∈ Λ1
(apply Lemma 8 for 𝛽 = 𝜆0 − 𝜈).
Since the element 𝑥𝛾̃︀ (1) stabilizes the covector 𝑔𝜆0 * , we obtain the following congruence:
(𝑔𝑥𝛾̃︀ (1))𝜆0 ,𝜈 ≡ 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜈

mod 𝐼 + .

However, we also have
(𝑔𝑥𝛾̃︀ (1))𝜆0 ,𝜈 = 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜈 ± 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇 .
This implies that 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜇 ∈ 𝐼 , which contradicts the choice of 𝜇.
Therefore, we have proved that for some 𝛾 ∈ ∆ and some 𝑡 ∈ 𝑅, we have
+

𝑔𝑥𝛾 (𝑡)𝑔 −1 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).
We also know that
𝑔𝑥𝛾 (𝑡)𝑔 −1 = 𝑒 + 𝑡(𝑔𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔 −1 − 𝑒),
which implies
𝑔𝑥𝛾 (1)𝑔 −1 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, (𝐼 + , 𝑅)).

Proposition 6. Let 𝐻 be an overgroup of 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) of level 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ), and let 𝑔 ∈
𝐻 ∩ R(𝑅). Then 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Proof. First, we reduce the proof to the case where one of the ideals in 𝜎 is equal to zero.
Assume that we can prove the proposition for such 𝜎, and let us prove it in general case.
Note that 𝜌𝐼 + (𝑔) ∈ 𝜌𝐼 + (𝐻) ∩ R(𝑅/𝐼 + ). By Corollary 3 we have:
lev(𝜌𝐼 + (𝐻)) = ((0), 𝜌𝐼 + (𝐼 − )).

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
Hence by assumption
𝜌𝐼 + (𝑔) ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅/𝐼 + , . . .) 6 𝑃 − .
Similarly, we obtain 𝜌𝐼 − (𝑔) ∈ 𝑃 , q.e.d.
Therefore, without loss of generality, we may assume that 𝐼 + = 0. Now we prove the
proposition in this case.
Suppose the contrary. Take 𝛼 from Lemma 34, applied to the element 𝑔 −1 , i.e.,
𝑔 −1 (𝑥𝛼 (1))𝑔 ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Set
𝑀 = {𝜆1 ∈ Λ1 : 𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 ̸= 0}.
For any 𝜆1 ∈ 𝑀 , set
𝑘(𝜆1 ) = min{𝑘 : (𝑔𝜆0 ,𝜆1 )𝑘 = 0}
(by Proposition 5, we have 𝑘(𝜆1 ) 6 3). Finally, set
∑︁
𝐾=
𝑘(𝜆1 ).
𝜆1 ∈𝑀

We prove by induction on 𝐾 that our assumption leads to a contradiction.
The base of induction: 𝐾 = 0; this means that 𝑀 = ∅. Together with Item 1 of
Lemma 25 this means exactly that 𝑔 ∈ 𝑃 − . Then 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) because otherwise, by
Item 2 of Proposition 2, the group 𝐻 cannot be of level 𝜎.
Now we pass to the induction step. Assume that 𝑀 ̸= ∅. Fix 𝜆1 ∈ 𝑀 . Set
{︃
B(𝑔, 𝜆1 ) 𝑘(𝜆1 ) = 2
B=
B(𝑔, 𝜆1 )2 𝑘(𝜆1 ) = 3
Then B2 = (0).
Case 1. 𝜌B (𝑔) ∈
/ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅/B, 𝜌B (𝜎)).
Note that 𝜌B (𝑔) ∈ 𝜌B (𝐻) ∩ R(𝑅/B). By Corollary 3 lev(𝜌B (𝐻)) = 𝜌B (𝜎), next, the
number 𝐾 for 𝜌B (𝑔) is less than that for 𝑔. Applying the inductive hypothesis, we obtain
a contradiction.
Case 2. 𝜌B (𝑔) ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅/B, 𝜌B (𝜎)).
By Lemma 19,
(𝑥𝛼 (1))𝜌B (𝑔) ∈ 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅/B, 𝜌B (𝜎)).
The group 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) ) maps surjectively onto the group 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅/B, 𝜌B (𝜎)). Hence
there exists ℎ ∈ 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) such that
𝜌B (ℎ) = (𝑥𝛼 (1))𝜌B (𝑔) = 𝜌B ((𝑥𝛼 (1))𝑔 ).
Then we have
𝑔1 = ℎ−1 (𝑥𝛼 (1))𝑔 ∈ (𝐻 ∩ 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅, B)) ∖ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
If 𝑔1 ∈ 𝑃 − , then the group 𝐻 cannot be of level 𝜎 by Proposition 2, and otherwise it
cannot by Proposition 4. This is a contradiction.

12. Finishing the proof of Theorem 1
Let 𝐻 be an overgroup of 𝐸(∆, 𝑅) of level 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ). We want to prove that
𝐻 6 𝑁𝐺(Φ,𝑅) (𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) .
By Proposition 1, it suffices to prove that for any 𝑔 ∈ 𝐻 and any generator 𝑥𝛼 (𝜉) of the
group 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) we have 𝑔 −1 𝑥𝛼 (𝜉)𝑔 ∈ 𝐺(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎). which is true indeed by Proposition 6.
13. Changing the lattice P
In this section we generalise Theorem 1 to other weight lattices. First note that Theorem 1 and Corollary 2 imply the following fact.
Corollary 4. Let 𝑅 R be a finitely generated ring, and let 𝐻 be an overgroup of 𝐸(∆, 𝑅)
of level 𝜎. Then there exists a natural number 𝑁 such that
𝐷𝑁 𝐻 = 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Note also that Corollary 4 is a stronger statement than Theorem 1. Indeed, for finitely
generated rings, Theorem 1 follows from Corollary 4 directly, and the general case can
be derived by using the fact that any ring is an inductive limit of its finitely generated
subrings. Let us transfer the result of Theorem 1 to other weight lattices in this stronger
form
Let P′ be another weight lattice between Q(Φ) and P(Φ). We denote by 𝐺P′ (Φ, 𝑅) the
corresponding Chevalley group. The subgroups 𝐸P′ (∆, 𝑅) and 𝐸P′ (Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎) for it are
defined similarly. In the case of P′ = P(Φ) we will use the subscript sc. Let 𝐶sc (Φ, 𝑅) be
the center of the group 𝐺sc (Φ, 𝑅).
For any intermediate subgroup
𝐸P′ (∆, 𝑅) 6 𝐻 6 𝐺P′ (Φ, 𝑅)
one can similarly define its level.
Proposition 7. Corollary 4, and hence Theorem 1, can be transferred to the simply connected group.
Proof. Let 𝐻 be an overgroup of 𝐸sc (Φ, 𝑅) of level 𝜎 = (𝐼 + , 𝐼 − ).
Consider the natural homomorphism
𝜋 : 𝐺sc (Φ, 𝑅) → 𝐺(Φ, 𝑅).
Obviously, we have lev 𝜋(𝐻) > 𝜎. Let us prove the inverse inclusion. Assume that 𝑥𝛽 (𝜉) ∈
𝜋(𝐻). for some 𝛽 ∈ Ω+ and 𝜉 ∈ 𝑅 ∖ 𝐼 + (the proof for Ω− is similar). Then for some
𝑔 ∈ 𝐶sc (Φ, 𝑅) we have 𝑔𝑥𝛽 (𝜉) ∈ 𝐻. Take 𝛼 from Lemma 8, then we have
𝑥𝛼+𝛽 (±𝜉) = [𝑥𝛼 (1), 𝑥𝛽 (𝜉)] = [𝑥𝛼 (1), 𝑔𝑥𝛽 (𝜉)] ∈ 𝐻,
which contradicts the assumption
34

overgroups of Levi subgroups I.
Thus lev 𝜋(𝐻) = 𝜎. Hence for a large 𝑁 the following inclusion holds
𝐷𝑁 𝜋(𝐻) 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Therefore, we have the inclusion
𝐷𝑁 𝐻 6 𝐶(Φ, 𝑅)𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎),
which, in its turn, implies that
𝐷𝑁 +1 𝐻 6 𝐸(Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).

Proposition 8. Corollary 4, and hence Theorem 1, can be transfered to an arbitrary weight
lattice P′ .
Proof. Let
𝜋 : 𝐺sc → 𝐺P′ (Φ, 𝑅)
be the natural homomorphism.

Now let 𝐻 be an overgroup of 𝐸P′ (∆, 𝑅) of level 𝜎. Replacing 𝐻 with its commutant,
we may assume that 𝐻 ⊆ Im 𝜋. Clearly, we have lev(𝜋 −1 (𝐻)) = 𝜎. Then for a large 𝑁 we
have
𝐷𝑁 𝜋 −1 (𝐻) = 𝐸sc (Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
Since 𝐻 6 Im 𝜋, we have 𝐻 = 𝜋(𝜋 −1 (𝐻)). which implies the formula
𝐷𝑁 𝐻 = 𝜋(𝐷𝑁 𝜋 −1 (𝐻)) = 𝜋(𝐸sc (Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎)) = 𝐸P′ (Φ, ∆, 𝑅, 𝜎).
