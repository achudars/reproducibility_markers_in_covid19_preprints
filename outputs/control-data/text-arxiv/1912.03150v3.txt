ON TWO PROPERTIES OF THE FISHER INFORMATION
NICOLAS ROUGERIE
Abstract. Alternative proofs for the superadditivity and the affinity (in the large system
limit) of the usual and some fractional Fisher informations of a probability density of many
variables are provided. They are consequences of the fact that such informations can be
interpreted as quantum kinetic energies.

1. Introduction
The Fisher information of a symmetric probability measure of N variables (see Definition
2.1 below) is known to be:
A. Superadditive: the information of the full measure is not smaller than the sum of the
informations of marginals with n and N − n variables.

B. Affine linear in the large N limit: for probability measures that have a limit N → ∞,
the natural limiting information (mean, or level-3, information) is an affine functional.
A has been proved first in [3, Theorem 3] and then, by another method, in [8, Lemma 3.7].
B is deduced in [12, Proposition 3] from the corresponding property for the mean entropy,
originating in [18]. In [8, Section 5.3] a different proof is provided, based on a general
abstract linearity lemma. The analogues for some fractional variants of Fisher’s information
are obtained in [21, 22].
This note provides alternative proofs of these properties. If the Fisher information
of a probability density µN ∈ Psym (RdN ) is interpreted as a quantum kinetic energy
for the quantum state |ΨN ihΨN |, orthogonal projector on the “quantum wave-function”
√
ΨN = µN ∈ L2sym (RdN ), both properties become quite natural. Roughly speaking A is
a consequence of the convexity of the kinetic energy as a function of |ΨN |2 and B follows
from its affinity as a function of |ΨN ihΨN |.

N. ROUGERIE

As for the motivations behind proving A and B, they mostly come from the study of
mean-field limits of large systems of statistical mechanics, classical and quantum. Indeed,
they do not seem to be of use in the theory of sufficient statistics, where the Fisher information originates. We however note that any quantity interpreted as an “information” should
certainly satisfy A. B has been known to hold for the entropy for a long time [18], and it
seems natural to ask its equivalent for the Fisher information.
Both properties are crucial to Kiessling’s approach [12] of the mean-field limit of bosonic
ground states (see [19, 20, Appendix A] for review), which involves interpreting the quantum
kinetic energy as a classical Fisher information. In fact we exploit here the reverse of
Kiessling’s point of view.
In [5], Fisher information bounds are used to control the mean-field limit of a classical
statistical mechanics system with stochastic diffusions (see [7] for review). The method
is general and has been adapted to other models, e.g. in [21, 22]. Briefly, the entropy
production1 along the flow is controlled first. The Fisher information is naturally linked to
variations of the entropy2, and one then deduces a control of the former quantity. This has
several important applications, one of which relies on A and B above. Briefly, A allows to
pass to the large N limit and control the mean information of limiting objects. Then B
implies that the de Finetti-Hewitt-Savage mixing measure of the limit is concentrated on
probability measures with finite Fisher information. Uniqueness theorems for the mean-field
equation in the latter class can then be put to good use.

2. Definitions and Results
We are concerned with classical mechanics states, symmetric probability measures µN ∈
Psym (RdN ) for the distribution of N indistinguishable particles living say in Rd . We will
freely identify measures and their densities with respect to Lebesgue measure on RdN .
Symmetric here means
µN (x1 , . . . , xN ) = µN (xσ(1) , . . . , xσ(N ) )

(2.1)

for almost all XN = (x1 , . . . , xN ) ∈ RdN and any permutation σ of the N indices. In the
applications we have in mind, XN can be a collection of spatial coordinates (this is the case
for bosonic mean-field limits as considered in [12]) or a collection of velocity variables (this
is the case for the applications in kinetic theory [8, 21, 22]).

1I follow the physicists’ convention that the entropy is produced, not dissipated.
2The Fisher information is the derivative of the entropy along the heat flow.

The quantities of our interest are as given in the
Definition 2.1 (Fisher informations).

Here hat-bearing functions stand for Fourier transforms and Cd,s is a constant only depending on d and s. That these various definitions are equivalent either follows from straightforward calculations or is proved in standard textbooks, such as [15]. The precise value of
the constant Cd,s is of no concern to this note but can be found in [15, 21, 22].
2. It follows from results of [1, 16, 2, 17] that

Here S d−1 is the euclidean sphere equipped with its Lebesgue measure dσ and θ = θ(σ)
represents the angle of σ with respect to the vertical axis. This implies that I1 ≡ I is a
natural limit case of Is for s → 1.

3. Other types of fractional Fisher informations are discussed in [25, 27, 26], in connection
with statistics, and [21], in connection with the fractional heat flow.
4. In [22] the fractional Fisher information is defined with an extra “cut-off”

with χ(x) = (1 + |x|2 )2γ , γ < 0. This does not significantly change the structure of the
object, nor the proofs of the results below. Indeed the ”kinetic energy”
hu|χ(−∆)s χ|ui

still enjoys the properties we need (see Properties 3.1), of which convexity as a function of
|u|2 and affinity as a function of the orthogonal projector |uihu| are the most crucial. We
leave the adaptations to the reader.

Define now, for any integer n 6 N , the n-th marginal/reduced density of a measure
µN ∈ Psym (RdN ) as the probability measure on Rdn with density

µN (x1 , . . . , xn , yn+1 , . . . , yN )dyn+1 . . . dyN .
(2.7)
µN (x1 , . . . , xn ) :=
Rd(N−n)

The first result we provide an alternative proof for is the superadditivity of the functionals
from Definition 2.1:
Theorem 2.2 (Superadditivity of Fisher informations).
Let n < N be two integers and µN ∈ Psym (RdN ). We have that
i
h
i
h

(n)
Is [µN ] > Is µN + Is µN

(2.8)

for any 0 < s 6 1.

Remarks.
1. For s = 1, Carlen proved this via a Minkowski-like inequality. Hauray-Mischler use a dual
formulation of the Fisher information (not mentioned in the remark after Definition 2.1)
to recover the result. For s < 1 the result is obtained in [22] using the last formulation
in (2.5). As per (2.6), this also implies the result for s = 1.
2. The short proof we provide uses standard tools of quantum mechanics: reduced density
matrices and convexity of µN 7→ Is [µN ].

3. A useful consequence is that, if N is an integer times n

In statistical mechanics one is often interested in the limit of large particle numbers,
N → ∞ , maybe with other parameters of the model scaled appropriately. Then our classical
states turn into symmetric probability measures over infinite sequences, µ ∈ Psym (RdN ).
One can also be interested in the limits N → ∞ with fixed n of the marginals (2.7). It can
then be useful to have a notion of “mean Fisher information” (sometimes also refered to as
level-3 information):

ON TWO PROPERTIES OF THE FISHER INFORMATION

Definition 2.3 (Mean Fisher information).
Let µ ∈ Psym (RdN ) be a symmetric probability measure over sequences in Rd . Equivalently3,
let (µ(n) )n be a sequence of symmetric probability measures over Rdn satisfying the consistency condition
(n)


µ(n+1)
For 0 < s 6 1 the mean (fractional) Fisher information of µ is
1
Is [µ] := lim sup Is [µ(n) ].
n→∞ n

(2.10)

The existence of the lim sup follows from (2.9). It is in fact possible to see that the lim sup
is both a sup and a lim, using Theorem 2.4.
The definition is in complete analogy with that of the mean entropy, originating in [18].
Perhaps surprisingly, this functional is affine, just as the mean entropy. We shall give an
alternative proof of the
Theorem 2.4 (The mean Fisher information is affine).
Let µ ∈ Psym (RdN ) and P ∈ P(P(Rd )) be its unique de Finetti-Hewitt-Savage measure, i.e.,
for all n > 0
Z

Assume that there exists a locally bounded V : Rd 7→ R with V (x) −→ +∞ such that

Then, the mean Fisher informations from Definition 2.3 satisfy, for all 0 < s 6 1
Z
Is [ρ]dP (ρ)
Is [µ] =

(2.12)

(2.13)

P(Rd )

with Is [ρ] as in Definition 2.1 with N = 1.

Remarks.
1. In (2.12) I demand a bit more “confinement” than in previous versions of the statement [12, 8, 22]. This is harmless in applications, for the theorem is meant to be applied
to limits N → ∞ of N -body classical states µN . In order for a state with infinitely many
particles to exist in the limit, a tightness argument of the type
Z

V µN < ∞, independently of N
Rd

is usually needed.

2. Kiessling [12] proved the s = 1 case, using the better known [18] affinity of the mean
entropy

The Fisher information is the derivative of the entropy along the heat flow. Since the latter
is linear (as is differentiation), the affinity of the Fisher information follows.

3. Hauray and Mischler [8] gave another proof for s = 1. A first sanity check is to convince
oneself that

where ρ∞ is the measure over RdN with n-th marginal ρ⊗n for any n. The reason for this is
that, if ρ1 6= ρ2 , ρ⊗N
becomes more and more alien (“orthogonal”) to ρ⊗N
for large N .

Very briefly, the proof of [8] checks a more elaborate version of the “partial affinity” (2.14),
and then applies a general abstract lemma implying full affinity.
4. The same strategy is applied to the s < 1 case in [22]. The abstract lemma applies
mutatis mutandis, but the argument giving the partial affinity is different. The sanity
check (2.14) can also be found in [19, 20, Appendix A].
5. Salem proves in [21] that the variant mean fractional information4 based on

more comments on the relation between Is and Ies and their respective uses. In particular,
for the applications of [21], results on Is could serve as alternatives to those on Ies .

3. Proofs

3.1. Preliminaries. Our point of view in this note is to think quantum mechanically, that
is, in terms of L2 functions and operators acting on them, rather than in terms of probability
measures. Pick µN ∈ Psym (RdN ). For it to have a finite Fisher information it must actually
be a function. Define then
√
ΨN = µN , ΓN = |ΨN ihΨN |
(3.1)
The first object above is a bosonic wave-function, namely ΨN ∈ L2sym (RdN , C) satisfies
ΨN (x1 , . . . , xN ) = ΨN (xσ(1) , . . . , xσ(N ) )

in analogy with (2.1). The second object in (3.1) is the L2 -orthogonal projector on the
complex linear span of ΨN . It is a bosonic state, i.e. a positive trace-class operator with
trace 1, acting on L2sym (RdN , C). Note that we do not use the usual quantization of classical
mechanics: we simply use that a classical state of position or velocity variables can be
directly embedded in a quantum formalism.
We shall write Fisher informations as quantum kinetic energies of ΨN or ΓN
with

Is [µN ] = hΨN |HN |ΨN iL2 = Tr (HN ΓN )
HN =

and hxj acting on the variable xj . We do not emphasize the dependence on s, for our proofs
shall be based solely on the following
Properties 3.1 (Quantum kinetic energies).
The kinetic energy
L2 (Rd , C) ∋ u 7→ hu|h|ui ∈ R+ ∪ {+∞}
with h as above is
(1) Positivity preserving
hu|h|ui > h|u| |h||u|i

(2) Convex as a function of |u|2 :

√
√
L1 (Rd , R+ ) ∋ ρ 7→ h ρ|h| ρi ∈ R+ ∪ {+∞}

is convex.
(3) With locally compact resolvent. For a locally bounded V : Rd 7→ R with
V (x) −→ +∞
|x|→∞

the operator h+V has compact resolvent, i.e. (h+V +c)−1 is compact as an operator
on L2 , where c is a constant sufficiently large for the inverse to make sense.
Remarks. The first property for s = 1 is just the straightforward (at least for smooth
functions u = |u|eiϕ ) identity
|∇u|2 = |∇|u||2 + |u|2 |∇ϕ|2 ,
a particular case of the diamagnetic inequality [15, Theorem 7.12]. For s > 1 it follows
immediately from the last definition in (2.5), the triangle inequality, and (2.6). Note that
“positivity preserving” usually means something stronger (but also true in the case at hand),
namely that the heat flow associated with h preserves positivity of functions. The property
we require usually goes hand-in-hand with this ”true” positivity-preserving property.
The second property can be found in [15, Theorems 7.8 and 7.13]. The third property
follows from the Sobolev compact embedding in L2 .

We also recall the notion of reduced density matrix, extending that of marginal (2.7).
(n)
We define the n-th reduced density matrix ΓN by a partial trace
(n)

ΓN := Trn+1→N ΓN .
This is the operator on L2sym (Rdn ) defined by the relation




(n)
Tr An ΓN = Tr An ⊗ 1⊗(N −n) ΓN

(3.3)

for any bounded operator An on L2sym (Rdn ). Note that ΓN , as a trace-class (in particular,
Hilbert-Schmidt) operator on L2 has an integral kernel
ΓN (x1 , . . . , xN ; y1 , . . . , yN ) = ΨN (y1 , . . . , yN )ΨN (x1 , . . . , xN ).

8

(n)

The integral kernel of ΓN is then given, formally, as
(n)

ΓN (x1 , . . . , xn ; y1 , . . . , yn ) =
Z
ΓN (x1 , . . . , xn , zn+1 , . . . , zN ; y1 , . . . , yn , zn+1 , . . . , zN )dzn+1 . . . dzN .
Rd(N−n)

One use of these objects is that, if N is a multiple of n,
Is [µN ] = Tr (HN ΓN ) =



N
(n)
Tr Hn ΓN
n

(3.4)

taking partial traces and using that HN is a sum of terms acting on one variable at a time.
3.2. Superadditivity. We now prove Theorem 2.2. The following considerations are very
much in the spirit of the Hoffmann-Ostenhof2 inequality [10, 13].
From (3.2) and (3.3) we have, similarly to in (3.4),




(N −n)
(n)
(3.5)
Is [µN ] = Tr Hn ΓN + Tr HN −n ΓN
(n)

where µN and ΓN are related by (3.1). Now, ΓN being a positive trace-class operator
with unit trace, the spectral theorem implies the existence of an orthonormal basis (uj ) of
L2 (Rdn ) such that
X
(n)

ΓN =

where the positive numbers λj add to 1. Thus

with µN the n-th marginal of µN and arguing similarly for the second term of (3.5).

This completes the proof.

3.3. Affinity. Our proof of Theorem 2.4 is based on the manifest affinity of (3.2) as a
function of ΓN , and the quantum de Finetti theorem, a generalization of the classical de
Finetti-Hewitt-Savage theorem, see [20, 19] for review. Readers familiar with the classical
theorem could note that the version of the quantum theorem I use has a proof (see [11]
and [14, Appendix A]) essentially identical to that of Hewitt-Savage [9].
First observe that, as per Item 2 in Properties 3.1, Definition 2.3 and (2.11) we immediately have that
Z
Is [µ] 6

P(Rd )

Is [ρ]dP (ρ).

We aim at a corresponding lower bound.
Define, for any N ∈ N, a bosonic quantum wave-function and a bosonic quantum state
as

where µ(N ) is the N -th marginal of µ ∈ Psym (RdN ). Let then, for k 6 N , ΓN be the reduced

density matrix (3.3) of ΓN . At fixed k, the sequence (ΓN )N is by definition bounded in the
trace-class. Modulo a (not-relabeled) subsequence we thus have

subsequence in N .

is the quantum analogue of the Hewitt-Savage theorem where one uses tightness of the marginals. There is
also a ”weak” quantum de Finetti theorem, relying only on weak-⋆ convergence of reduced density matrices.

Let P ∈ P(P(Rd )) be the classical de Finetti measure defined in Theorem 2.4 and Q ∈
P(L2 (Rd )) the quantum de Finetti measure defined in (3.11). We have, for any bounded
continuous function Φ over P(Rd )
Z
Z
Φ(ρ)dP (ρ) = Φ(|u|2 )dQ(u).
Proof. The monomial functions Φ of the form (see [6, Section 1.7])
Z
ϕk ρ⊗k
Φ(ρ) = Mk,ϕk (ρ) =
Rdk

with k ∈ N and ϕk bounded continuous over Rdk generate a subalgebra of the continuous
functions on the space of probability measures. This subalgebra is dense by the StoneWeierstrass theorem and it thus suffices to test the claim against all the above monomials.
We identify the function ϕk with the multiplication operator thereby to write
Z

ϕk µ(k)
Mk,ϕk (ρ)dP (ρ) =

using Equations (2.11)-(2.7)-(3.1)-(3.3) and, in the last step, the fact that multiplication
by a bounded function is a bounded operator to pass to the limit using (3.10). Since the
left-hand side actually does not depend on N we deduce
Z

Mk,ϕk (ρ)dP (ρ) = Tr ϕk γ (k) .
As per (3.11) this implies the desired

Z
Mk,ϕk (ρ)dP (ρ) = Mk,ϕk (|u|2 )dQ(u).

This being true for all k and ϕk , the proofs of the lemma and the theorem (approximating
