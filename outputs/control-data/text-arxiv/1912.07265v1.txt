ABSTRACT

The inhomogeneous surface distribution of heavy elements is known to cause periodic
light variability of magnetic chemically peculiar stars. It is unclear to what extent
the same paradigm applies to mercury-manganese (HgMn) stars. We aim to model
the photometric variability of the HgMn star ϕ Phe using abundance maps obtained
from high-resolution spectroscopy and to study how this variability evolves with time.
We compute a grid of atlas12 model atmospheres and the corresponding synspec
synthetic spectra. Interpolating within this grid and integrating the specific intensity
over the visible stellar surface at different rotational phases, we obtain theoretical light
curves of the star. We predict the variability of ϕ Phe in the ultraviolet and in the
visible spectral regions with amplitude of the order of millimagnitudes, mainly caused
by absorption in lines of yttrium, chromium, and titanium. We also show how this
variability is affected by changes of the distribution of the heavy elements over time.
The main characteristics of the predicted light variability of ϕ Phe correspond roughly
to the variability of the star observed with the TESS satellite.

INTRODUCTION

Mercury-manganese (HgMn) stars, also known as CP3 stars,
typically feature an increased and inhomogeneous surface
distribution of heavy elements, such as Hg, Ga, Mn, Y, Sr,
or Cr (Castelli & Hubrig 2004; Monier et al. 2015). Unlike
most other types of chemically peculiar stars with abundance spots, HgMn stars do not have strong organised
magnetic fields (e.g., Hubrig et al. 2012; Kochukhov et al.
2013; Catanzaro et al. 2016). Slow rotation, atomic diffusion, and a lack of sub-surface convective zone are probably the cause of their abnormal chemical composition
(Michaud et al. 1976). HgMn stars are predominantly found
in binary systems (Budaj 1996; Schöller et al. 2010).
Line profile variations and inhomogeneous surface distribution of elements have been observed in some of HgMn
stars (e.g., Briquet et al. 2010; Makaganiuk et al. 2011).
Also, evidence of the secular evolution of the surface abundance structures has been provided (e.g., Kochukhov et al.
2007; Hubrig et al. 2010). However, observations of the pho-

tometric variability of HgMn stars are still relatively rare
(Paunzen et al. 2018).
When the line profile variations are observed in a
star, Doppler imaging can be used to derive the surface
distribution of chemical elements if the rotation is fast
enough (e.g., Rice et al. 1989; Piskunov & Kochukhov 2002;
Lüftinger et al. 2010). Similarly, when abundance maps are
available, we can use model atmospheres and synthetic spectra to predict photometric variability of the star. Comparing
the light curve obtained in this way with the observed photometric variability of the star (where available) can also
serve as a verification of the abundance maps, atomic data
and our comprehension of stellar atmospheres. This method
has been used with success several times in the past (e.g.,
Krtička et al. 2009; Prvák et al. 2015).
However, this method cannot be easily applied to HgMn
stars. Doppler imaging requires relatively bright targets,
while the photometry with sufficient precision can only be
derived using space-borne photometry, which is typically
possible only for relatively faint stars (e.g., Hümmerich et al.
2018), making combining the two techniques quite difficult. Therefore, only a comparison of general properties

METHODS

We used a series of abundance maps obtained using the
CORALIE spectrograph in October 2000, December 2000,
August 2009 and January 2010 (Korhonen et al. 2013). The
overall distribution of chromium, titanium, strontium, and
yttrium is shown as histograms in Fig. 1. Here, the abunel
dance of each element is expressed as εel = log N
NH . The
vertical axis of Fig. 1 shows the total area Sεel , where the
abundance of the given element lies within the interval
(εel − δ/2; εel + δ/2), where δ corresponds to the width of a
column in the histogram. In Fig. 1, S∗ denotes stellar surface
area.
We applied the atlas12 code (Kurucz 1996; Castelli
2005) to compute a grid of model atmospheres covering
the relevant range of abundances in the maps. The physical parameters of the star are listed in Table 1. Table 2
shows the abundance values used for each individual element of the abundance grid. The atomic data were taken
from the Kurucz’s website1 . We applied the synspec code
(with atomic data from Lanz & Hubeny 2007) to produce
the corresponding synthetic spectra for each model atmosphere. By means of multilinear interpolation within the
grid of synthetic spectra and integrating over wavelength,
we calculated corresponding angle-dependent specific intensities for each of the 240 × 120 elements of the stellar surface.
Summing over the visible surface of the star, we obtained the
emergent flux and, consequently, the light curves of the star
(see Prvák et al. (2015) for more details). We adopted the
ephemeris J D = 2 451 800.0 + 9.53077 from Korhonen et al.
(2013).

of predicted and observed light curves is currently feasible
for HgMn stars. Recently, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS) provided us with the capability to observe
relatively bright targets with sufficient precision, making the
detection of the photometric variability possible for at least
some HgMn stars (see e.g., Sikora et al. 2019).
In the present work, we want to investigate the effect of
the presence of heavy elements on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the emergent radiation, to show whether
or not it leads to photometric variability, and to study how
this variability is affected by the secular evolution of the surface abundance spots. Preliminary results were published in
conference proceedings Prvák et al. (2018). Our object of
interest is a HgMn star ϕ Phe (HR 558, HD 11753).
The
star
ϕ
Phe is
a
spectroscopic
binary (Pourbaix et al. 2013). The inhomogeneous distribution of heavy elements was investigated by Briquet et al.
(2010) and later revisited in Korhonen et al. (2013). Only
weak magnetic fields or no fields have been reported in ϕ
Phe (Makaganiuk et al. 2012; Hubrig et al. 2010).

Influence of chemical elements

The presence of heavy elements in the photosphere causes
some portion of the spectral energy to be absorbed mainly
by bound-bound transitions in the ultraviolet region of the
spectrum. This energy is then re-emitted mostly in the nearultraviolet and in the visible. The effect this process has on
the spectral energy distribution (SED) is shown in Fig. 2.
Because the absorption occurs mostly in lines, while the reemission contributes mostly in continuum, the resulting effect varies very strongly with wavelength.
As a result, the parts of the stellar surface with higher
concentration of heavy elements will appear as dark spots in
the far-UV, while the same spots will show as bright in the
visible. The total flux integrated over the entire spectrum,
though, is conserved. Fig. 3 shows the emergent flux from
the surface of the star in two different passbands, a gaussian function centered at 1700 Å and the red–infrared TESS
passband (see Fig. 2 for the response functions of the various
passbands used in this paper). Because there is more than
one element contributing to the spectral energy redistribution, and the absorption lines of these individual elements
dominate different regions of the spectrum, the shape of the
bright and dark spots on the stellar surface varies with wavelength.

(IUE). Lower panel: Emergent flux from model atmospheres with enhanced abundance of the individual elements minus the flux from
the reference model. The model fluxes were smoothed with Gaussian filters (standard deviation σ = 25 Å for the models and 10 Å for
the IUE spectra) to emphasize the changes in continuum.

Predicted flux distribution for reference abundances
agrees reasonably with the IUE observations (SWP 19761
and LWR 15774)2 in Fig. 2. Small differences are most likely
caused by missing opacity in model atmospheres.

3.2

Effect of the individual elements

The inhomogeneous distribution of flux in most spectral
bands, together with stellar rotation, leads to periodic photometric variability of the star. Fig. 4 shows the overall modelled photometric variability of the star, together with the
photometric variability computed only taking into account
the effect of each individual chemical element separately, to
show the contribution of each element to the overall variability of the star. The central wavelengths and half-widths
of the filters used in the plots are taken from Prvák et al.
(2015). While the shape of the curves of the individual elements remains roughly the same at all wavelengths, being
“composed” in different ratios results in a curve of varying
shape.
Fig. 5 shows the dependence of the amplitude of the

photometric variability on wavelength. Again, the amplitude
of the overall variability, defined as one-half of the difference
between the maximum and the minimum magnitude of the
star, is plotted together with the amplitude of the variability computed only taking into account the influence of the
four chemical elements, one at a time. The variability of the
star is largest in the far-UV part of the spectrum, especially
around 1300–1400 Å, mainly because of the very low overall
flux in this region. In the near-UV and the optical region up
to about 6000 Å, the amplitude in narrow passbands varies
significantly with wavelength due to the significant absorption in lines. In the red and the infrared, the variability is
mostly governed by re-emission in continuum and the amplitude is relatively constant throughout the region.
Yttrium, which shows the most pronounced abundance
variation, seems to also have the strongest effect on the variability, especially in the visible part of the spectrum. The effect of titanium and chromium is also significant. Strontium
only contributes to the overall variability marginally.
Fig. 6 compares the overall modelled photometric variability of the star in four different times corresponding to
the four sets of the abundance maps available. The secular
evolution of the abundance spots causes a small but visible change in the shape of the light curves. The changes in
the shape of the light curves are mostly caused by the secu-

chromium and yttrium.
There are space-borne photometric observations of the
star obtained by TESS (Ricker et al. 2015), spanning a period of 30 days in September 2018, of which 21 days of usable
data are left after reduction and detrending. This photometry is shown in Fig. 7 together with our synthetic light
curves corresponding to the four individual sets of abundance maps. Unfortunately, there are no abundance maps
available for the epoch corresponding to the TESS observations. For this reason, the comparison is only qualitative.
The amplitude of the predicted light curve agrees reasonably
well with the observations. However, the double-wave form
of the observed variability is not reproduced, the brightness
increase with maximum at approximately the phase 0.35 is
missing.

DISCUSSION

Our results about the variability of the studied HgMn star
nicely agree with general characteristics of variability of
this type of stars derived using space borne instruments.
For example, Hümmerich et al. (2018) detected periodical

light variations in HgMn star KIC 6128830 with amplitude
3.4 mmag and period about 5 days. These variations are
fully comparable to the light variations of ϕ Phe. Also HgMn
star HD 45975 shows a similar time-scale and amplitude
of variability as ϕ Phe (Morel et al. 2014). The abundance
variations in some HgMn stars are likely so weak, that the
corresponding light variability evades detection even with
modern instruments (Ghazaryan et al. 2013). On the other
hand, larger surface overabundance is required to explain the
rotational light variability of HgMn stars with amplitudes of
about 0.01 mag (Strassmeier et al. 2017).
The predicted variability of the star does not agree completely with the observations by TESS. The discrepancy between the models and the observations can be partially
explained by the ongoing secular evolution of the surface
abundance structures between the years 2010 and 2018. The
changes in the abundance maps are rather small, so one
would not really expect drastic changes like seen between
the TESS light-curve and the light-curves obtained from
the Doppler images. The discrepancy is strongest at phases
about 0.2–0.4. However, this is also the part of the light
curve, where the shape of the light curve changes most drastically between the individual datasets. Possibly, a new spot
could have formed here, eventually leading to the double
humped light curve. Obtaining new spectroscopic observations of the star to verify whether or not this is the case
would be very useful.
Additionally, abundance structures of chemical elements other than the four considered in our models could
contribute to the light variability, changing the amplitude
or shape of the light curve. Missing opacity due to additional
elements could explain small differences between predicted
and observed fluxes in Fig. 2. Finally, the binarity of the star
ϕ Phe may have affected the amplitude of both the observed
and the modelled light variability. However, Pourbaix et al.
(2013) reports a magnitude difference of 5.7 in V and 3.9
in K. It is therefore unlikely that the secondary component
could have affected the light variability significantly.
Our models also indicate that the secular evolution of
the abundance structures causes a gradual shift in the phases
of photometric minima and maxima. That may affect adversely the determination of the rotational period of the star,
which has never been established with certainty (see, e.g.,
Korhonen et al. 2013). An incorrectly determined period, on
the other hand, may make a false impression of the evolution
of the abundance structures.
Contrary to many other chemically peculiar stars, the
mechanism of the light variability of ϕ Phe cannot be tested
in the UV with the available instruments. The amplitude of
the flux variability in the UV is only a few millimagnitudes
(see Fig. 4) and is therefore an order of magnitude smaller
than the precission of the typical flux calibrated UV spectrographs, which is about a few percentage points (Riley
2018).
Our study of the light variability of ϕ Phe may provide a clue for the explanation of periodical low-amplitude
light variability in A type stars derived using Kepler satellite (Balona 2011; Balona et al. 2013). The amplitude of the
detected light variability is similar to that predicted here.
Such variations can be tested using detailed spectroscopy.
We predicted photometric variability of ϕ Phe. However, there are some things to keep in mind. First of all, the

tion for the given star. While varying the chemical abundances during the mapping process, these modified values
are used to produce changes in the modelled line profiles.
However, the model atmosphere is not changed accordingly.
This means that the effect the modified chemical composition has on the physical structure of the atmosphere is not
taken into account. This may also affect the accuracy of our
result. The acceptability of this simplification has been questioned by Stift et al. (2012), but Kochukhov et al. (2012)
showed that this approximation does not significantly influence the result, with the exception of cases with extreme
overabundance of heavy elements. The good agreement of
our previous works with observations supports this conclusion.

be less precise than using NLTE models. However, as shown
by Krtička et al. (2012), NLTE effects do not affect the SED

variability and it is difficult to verify experimentally. However, we were able to discern the variability in the TESS pho-

increased abundance of heavy chemical elements such as yttrium is common in HgMn stars. The research of these stars,
of their atmospheres and variability would certainly benefit
from availability of more detailed, complete and accurate
atomic data.
We also show that the secular evolution of the spots,
especially those of titanium and chromium, are reflected in
the changes of the photometric variability of the star.
Our results contribute to the rather small amount of
cases of the observed photometric variability in HgMn stars.
Hopefully, it will also provide verification of the abundance
maps of the star and the Doppler imaging technique in general, the atomic data and the theory of stellar atmospheres.

the sets of abundance maps and the photometric observations and possibly missing information on the abundance
