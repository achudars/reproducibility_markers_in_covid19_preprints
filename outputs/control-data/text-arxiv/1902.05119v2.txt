Abstract
Let E1 , . . . , Ek be a collection of linear series on an irreducible algebraic variety X over C which is
not assumed to be complete or affine. That is, Ei ⊂ H 0 (X, Li ) is a finite dimensional subspace of the
space of regular sections of line bundles Li . Such a collection is called overdetermined if the generic
system
s1 = . . . = sk = 0,
with si ∈ Ei does not have any roots on X. In this paper we study consistent systems which are given
by an overdetermined collection ofQlinear series. Generalizing the notion of a resultant hypersurface we
k
define a consistency variety R ⊂ i=1 Ei as the closure of the set of all systems which have at least
one common root and study general properties of zero sets Zs of a generic consistent system s ∈ R.
Then, in the case of equivariant linear series on spherical homogeneous spaces we provide a strategy
for computing discrete invariants of such generic non-empty set Zs . For equivariant linear series on the
torus (C∗ )n this strategy provides explicit calculations and generalizes the theory of Newton polyhedra.

Introduction

Let X be an irreducible algebraic variety over C and let E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) be a collection of base-point free
linear series on X. That is, Ei ⊂ H 0 (X, Li ) is a finite dimensional subspace of the space of regular sections
of globally generated line bundles Li , such that there are no points x ∈ X with s(x) = 0 for any s ∈ Ei .
A collection of linear series E defines systems of equations on X of the form
s1 = · · · = sk = 0,

(1)

where si ∈ Ei . A collection E is called overdetermined if system (1) does not have any roots on X for the
generic choice of s = (s1 , . . . , sk ) ∈ E = E1 × . . . × Ek . If generic system (1) has a solution we will say that
E is generically consistent. Here, and everywhere in this paper, by saying that some property is satisfied
by a generic point of an irreducible algebraic variety Y we mean that there exists a Zariski closed subset
Z ⊂ Y such that for any y ∈ Y \ Z this property is satisfied.
In this paper we study overdetermined collections of linear series and their generic non-empty zero sets.
For a collection E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) we define the consistency variety RE ⊂ E to be the closure of the set
of all systems s which have at least one common root on X. A consistency variety RE is an irreducible
variety which is a generalization of the resultant hypersurface. We study RE in Section 2.
One of the main goals of this paper is to find discrete invariants of the zero set of a generic consistent
system s ∈ RE . This goal is motivated by the study of families of complete intersections. A motivating
example for us is a system of equations defining the singular locus of an algebraic hypersurface. Let H be a
hypersurface defined by a polynomial f on Cn . The singular locus of H is given by the conditions f = df = 0
which could be viewed as n + 1 algebraic equations in n variables. Since this system is overdetermined,
the generic hypersurface is smooth. However, for a generic 1-parameter family of hypersurfaces Ht defined
by polynomials ft one would see singular hypersurfaces. In this setting, questions about the topology of
the singular loci appearing in the generic families are translated to questions about the topology of generic
non-empty zero sets of overdetermined linear systems.
Newton Polyhedra theory and generalisations. There are lots of results on the zero sets of a system
of equations defined by the generic member of a linear series. First such results are provided by the theory
of Newton polyhedra which work with equivariant linear series on (C∗ )n .
P
The Newton polyhedron ∆(f ) ⊂ Rn of a Laurent polynomial f = ai xki is the convex hull of vectors
ki with ai 6= 0. For a fixed polytope ∆ let E∆ be a finite dimensional vector space of Laurent polynomials
f such that ∆(f ) ⊂ ∆. Newton polyhedra theory allows one to find discrete invariants of the zero set Zs of
the system (1) where si is a generic member of E∆i in terms of combinatorics of the polytopes ∆1 , . . . , ∆k .
An example of such a result is the celebrated Bernstein-Kouchnirenko-Khovanskii Theorem (see [Ber75]).
Theorem (BKK Theorem). Let s1 , . . . , sn be generic Laurent polynomials with ∆(si ) = ∆i . Then all
solutions of the system s1 = . . . = sn = 0 in (C∗ )n are non-degenerate and the number solutions is
n!V ol(∆1 , . . . , ∆n ),
where V ol is the mixed volume.
For more examples of results of Newton polyhedra theory see [Kho78, Kho88, DK86].
Newton polyhedra theory has generalizations to other classes of algebraic varieties such as spherical
homogeneous spaces G/H with a collection of G-invariant linear systems. The first result in this direction
was a generalization of the BKK Theorem and was obtained by Brion and Kazarnovskii in [Bri89, Kaz87].
For more results see for example [Kir06, Kir07, KK16]. The role of the Newton polytope in these results
is played by the Newton-Okounkov polytope, which is a polytope fibered over the moment polytope with
string polytopes as fibers.
Even more generally, in [KK12] and [LM09] Newton polyhedra theory was generalized to the theory of
Newton-Okounkov bodies. For a linear series E on an irreducible algebraic variety X one can associate a
2

convex body ∆(E) called the Newton-Okounkov body in such a way that the number of roots of a generic
system
s1 = . . . = sn = 0
with si ∈ E is equal to n!V ol(∆(E)).
All these results work for a generic system. That is, as before, in the space of systems E = E1 × . . . × Ek
there exists a Zariski closed subset D such that for any system s ∈ E \ D discrete invariants of the zero
set Zs are the same and can be computed combinatorially. In particular, for overdetermined systems all
the answers provided by these results are trivial.
Structure of the paper, formulation of the results and related previous work. Studying a
generic consistent system given by an overdetermined collection of linear series is a particular case of
studying generic among non-generic systems. For generically consistent collections of linear series, the
study of generic among non-generic systems is usually hard. Even in the case of the BKK Theorem
such results are quite technical and recent (see [Mon18]). However, if a collection of linear systems is
overdetermined, there are lots of cases where questions about the topology of generic non-empty zero sets
could be answered rather explicitly in terms of combinatorics. First results in this direction were already
obtained in [GKZ94]. It was shown there that for collections of finite sets A1 , . . . , An+1 ⊂ Zn which generate
the lattice, the generic consistent system of Laurent polynomials with supports in A′i s has a unique root.
This result was later generalised by different authors for more general undetermined systems of Laurent
polynomials (see [Est07, Est10, DS15]). These results were further generalized in [Mon17] and described
in Section 5 of this paper.
In Section 2, for an overdetermined collection of linear series, we define the consistency variety RE ⊂ E
which is the closure of the set of all consistent systems and prove that it is irreducible. Basic geometric
properties of RE are studied in Theorems 2.4 and 2.5. In Subsection 2.4 we consider the case when
codim(RE ) = 1 and define the resultant polynomial of a collection E. The resultant of a collection of linear
series is a generalization of the L-resultant defined in [GKZ94]. We prove that all the basic properties of the
L-resultant are also satisfied by the resultant of a collection of linear series. A related version of resultant
was also studied in [BEM00] in the case when X is projective with an open subset U parametrized by an
open subset of An . In the case when conditions of [BEM00] are satisfied, our resultant is a non-trivial
degree of the one defined in [BEM00] (see Definition 6 and a footnote after it for details).
Section 3 is devoted to studying the generic non-empty zero set of an overdetermined collection of
linear systems E on an irreducible variety X. One of the main results of this section is Theorem 3.1 which
expresses a generic non-empty zero set of system (1), defined by E, as the generic zero set of another linear
series which is generically consistent. This allows one to use classical results described in the previous
subsection to find the topology of the generic non-empty zero set in a number of examples.
In Section 4 we study G-equivariant linear series on homogeneous G-spaces. Spherical homogeneous
spaces are of special interest to us. We apply Theorem 3.1 to obtain Theorem 4.2 which provides a strategy
for computing discrete invariants of a generic non-empty zero set of an overdetermined linear series on a
spherical homogeneous space. An example of an application of Theorem 4.2 is given in Subsection 4.3.
In Section 5 we study overdetermined linear systems on the torus (C∗ )n . In this case the strategy
provided by Theorem 4.2 can be made absolutely explicit. In particular, one can explicitly express invariants
of generic non-empty zero sets in terms of combinatorics of Newton polyhedra. Theorem 5.2 is an explicit
version of Theorem 4.2 in this case. Theorem 5.3, which generalizes the BKK-theorem, is an example
of how one can use Theorem 5.2 together with results of Newton polyhedra theory to compute discrete
invariants of generic non-empty zero sets. The results of Section 5 appeared previously in [Mon17] and are
included in this paper for completeness of exposition.

Consistency variety and resultant of a collection of linear series on a
variety

In this section we define the consistency variety of a collection of linear series and describe its main
properties.

2.1

Background

Let X be an irreducible complex algebraic variety. Let L1 , . . . Lk be globally generated line bundles on X.
For i = 1, . . . , k, let Ek ⊂ H 0 (X, Li ) be finite-dimensional, base-point free linear series. Let E denote the
k-fold product E1 × · · · × Ek .
e E ⊂ X × E is defined as:
Definition 1. The incidence variety R

e E = {(p, (s1 , . . . , sk )) ∈ X × E | f1 (p) = . . . = fk (p) = 0}.
R

Let π1 : X × E → X, π2 : X × E → E be natural projections to the first and the second factors of the
product.
e L under the projection π2 .
Definition 2. The consistency variety RE ⊂ ΩA is the closure of the image of R
e E ⊂ X × L and the consistency variety RE are irreducible algebraic
Theorem 2.1. The incidence variety R
varieties.
e E of any point p ∈ X is defined by k
Proof. Since E1 , . . . Ek are base-point free, the preimage π1−1 (p) ⊂ R
eE:
independent linear equations on elements of E. Therefore, the projection π1 restricted to R
eE → X
π1 : R

forms a vector bundle of rank dim(L) − k and in particular is irreducible.
e E ) is the image of an irreducible algebraic variety R
e E under
The set of consistent systems RE = π2 (R
the algebraic map π2 , so it is irreducible constructible set. Hence it’s closure is an irreducible algebraic
variety.
For two linear systems Ei and Ej , let their product Ei Ej be a vector subspace of H 0 (X, Li ⊗ Lj )
generated by all the elements of the form f ⊗ g with f ∈ Ei and g ∈ Ej . For any J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}, by EJ we
Q
will denote the product j∈J Ej .
To a base-point free linear system E, one can associate a morphism ΦE : X → P(E ∗ ) called a Kodaira
map. It is defined as follows: for a point x ∈ X its image ΦE (x) ∈ P(E ∗ ) is the hyperplane Ex ∈ E
consisting of all the sections g ∈ E which vanish at x. We will denote by YE the image of the Kodaira map
ΦE and by τE the dimension of YE . For a collection of linear series E1 , . . . , Ek and J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} we will
write ΦJ , YJ and τJ for ΦEJ , YEJ and τEJ respectively.
Definition 3. For a collection of linear series E1 . . . , Ek , the defect of a subcollection J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} is
defined as
def(EJ ) = τJ − |J|.
The following theorem of Kaveh and Khovanskii gives a condition on a collection of linear series to be
generically consistent in terms of defects.
Theorem 2.2 ([KK16] Theorems 2.14 and 2.19). The generic system of equations s1 = . . . = sk = 0 with
fi ∈ Ei is consistent if and only if def(EJ ) ≥ 0 for any J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}.
In other words, Theorem 2.2 states that the codimension of the consistency variety is equal to 0 in E if
and only if def(EJ ) ≥ 0 for any J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}. In Subsection 2.3 we will generalize this result by finding
the codimension of RE in terms of defects of subcollections.

2.2

The defect of vector subspaces and essential subcollections

In this subsection we will introduce a combinatorial version of the defect and relate it to the one given
in Definition 3. Let k be any field and V = (V1 , . . . , Vk ) be a collection of vector subspaces of a vector
space W ∼
= kn (in this paper we will always work with k = C or R). For J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} let VJ be the sum
P
j∈J Vj and πJ : W → W/VJ be the natural projection.
Definition 4. For a collection of vector subspaces V = (V1 , . . . , Vk ) of W we define
i) the defect of a subcollection J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} by def(J) = dim(VJ ) − |J|;
ii) the minimal defect d(V) of a collection V to be the minimal defect of J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}.
iii) an essential subcollection to be a subcollection J so that def(J) = d(V) and def(I) > def(J) for any
proper subset I of J.

The essential subcollections have proved to be useful in studying systems of equations which are generically inconsistent and their resultants. The above definition is related to the definition of an essential
subcollection given in [Stu94]: the two definitions coincide if d(V) = −1, but are different in general. The
following theorem provides combinatorial tools to work with collection of vector subspaces.
Theorem 2.3 ([Mon17] Section 3). Let V = (V1 , . . . , Vk ) be a collection of vector subspaces of W with
d(V) ≤ 0, then:
i) an essential subcollection exists and is unique.
ii) if J is the unique essential subcollection of V and J c isv the complement subcollection, then d(πJ (J c )) =
0.
iii) if J is the essential subcollection there exists a subcollection I ⊂ J of size dim(VJ ) with d(I) = 0.
Parts i) and ii) of Theorem 2.3 are still true in the case d(V) > 0, the unique essential subcollection
in this case is the empty subcollection. A subcollection I from part iii) of Theorem 2.3 is almost never
unique.
To relate the combinatorial version of defect to the geometric version defined in Definition 3 we introduce
a collection of distributions (and codistributions) on X related to a collection of linear systems E1 , . . . , Ek .
Let X and E1 , . . . , Ek be as before, denote further by X sing the singular locus of X, by YJsing the singular
locus of YJ = ΦJ (X). 

J⊂{1,...,k}

So we get that U is a smooth algebraic variety and for any J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} the restriction ΦJ : U →
(YJ \ YJsing ) is a submersion to a smooth locus of YJ . In particular, the rank of the differential dΦJ of ΦJ
is constant on U and is equal to τJ for any J.

In the case of equivariant linear series on homogeneous space G H (in particular, in the classical case
of linear series on (C∗ )n ) subvarieties YJsing and ΣcJ are empty. In general, this is not true:
• For an example of YJsing being non empty consider X = A1 with a coordinate x and a linear series
E on X spanned by regular functions 1, x2 , x3 . Then the image of X under the Kodaira map:
Φ : X → P(E ∗ ) ≃ P2 = [z0 : z1 : z2 ]
is contained in the affine chart z0 6= 0 and is defined in it by the unique equation z13 − z22 = 0. In
particular, Y sing = [1 : 0 : 0] and is non-empty.
• For an example where ΣcJ 6= ∅, let X = A2 with coordinates x, y, and E = span(1, x2 + y 2 ). Then
the Kodaira map Φ : X → P(E ∗ ) = [z0 : z1 ] is given by:
Φ(x, y) = [1 : x2 + y 2 ].
5

The image Φ(X) is an affine chart z0 6= 0 and is in particular smooth. Nevertheless, the differential
dΦ = 2x dx + 2y dy vanishes at the point
(0, 0) and has rank 1 everywhere else on X. So the critical

Definition 5. Let a ∈ U and FeJ (a) be the subspace of the tangent space Ta U defined by the linear equations
dga = 0 for all g ∈ EJ . Let also FeJ∨ (a) ⊂ Ta∗ U be the annihilator of FeJ (a). Then
(1) FeJ is an (n − τJ )-dimensional distribution on the Zariski open set U ⊂ X defined by the collection of
subspaces FeJ (a).
(2) FeJ∨ is a τJ -dimensional codistribution on the Zariski open set U ⊂ X defined by the collection of
subspaces FeJ∨ (a).
Lemma 2.1. The distribution FeJ and codistribution FeJ∨ on U are well defined, i.e. dim(FeJ (a)) = n − τJ
and dim(FeJ (a)) = τJ for any a ∈ U . Moreover, FeJ is completely integrable, its leaves are connected
components of the fibers the Kodaira map ΦJ : U → YJ .

Proof. For the first part of the lemma it is enough to show that dim(FeJ (a)) = n − τJ for any a ∈ U . Let
s1 , . . . , sr ∈ EJ be a basis, then in coordinates the Kodaira map is given by:
ΦJ (x) = [s1 (x) : . . . : sr (x)].
Therefore, the vector space FeJ (a) is the kernel of differential d(ΦJ ) of the Kodaira map. Since d(ΦJ ) is of
constant rank τJ on U ,


dim(FeJ (a)) = dim ker d(ΦJ ) a = n − τJ .

The second part of the lemma is an immediate corollary the Implicit Function Theorem. Indeed, by
Implicit Function Theorem the the fibers of ΦJ : U → YJ are smooth subvarieties of X of dimension n − τJ ,
tangent to ker(d(ΦJ )) = FeJ on U .
Fibers of the Kodaira maps ΦJ can be described in terms of systems of equations defined by collection
of linear series E1 , . . . , Ek .
Lemma 2.2 ([KK16] Lemma 2.11). For a, b ∈ X we have ΦJ (a) = ΦJ (b) if and only if for every i ∈ J
the sets {gi ∈ Ei |gi (a) = 0} and {gi ∈ Ei |gi (b) = 0} coincide.
Corollary 2.1. Let U ⊂ X be as before, then for any a ∈ U one has:
FEJ (a) =

The following Proposition 2.1 relates two definitions of the defect and is the main result of this subsection. Proposition 2.1 will allow us to apply combinatorial results of Theorem 2.3 to the geometric version
of defect.
Proposition 2.1. Let U ⊂ X be as before, then the defect def(EJ ) of linear system EJ (as in Definition 3)
is equal to the defect of a collection of vector subspaces (FE∨i (a))i∈J of T ∗ Ua (as in Definition 4) for any
a ∈ U.
Proof. By construction, FE∨J is τJ -dimensional codistribution on U , so dim(FE∨J (a)) = τJ for any a ∈ U .
Therefore, by Corollary 2.1 we have

Properties of the consistency variety

In this subsection we will investigate basic properties of the consistency variety. One of the main results of
this section is the following theorem which computes the codimension of the consistency variety in terms
of defects.
Theorem 2.4. Let E = (E1 , . . . Ek ) be a collection of base-point free linear systems on a quasi projective
irreducible variety X. Then the codimension of the consistency variety RE is equal to − d(E) where d(E)
is the minimal possible defect def(EJ ) for J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}.
We say that a collection of linear series E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) on X is injective if linear series from E separate
Q
points of X. In other words, E is injective if the product of Kodaira maps ki=1 ΦEi is injective on X. Note
Q
that by Lemma 2.2 the product of Kodaira maps ki=1 ΦEi is injective if and only if the Kodaira map ΦE
Qk
for E = i=1 Ei is such. Therefore, equivalently E is injective if the Kodaira map ΦE is injective.
Any collection of linear series E on X could be reduced to an injective collection Ee such that zero sets
of E and Ee are related in an easy way. In order to do so, let us describe the zero set Zs of a system of
equations s1 = . . . = sk = 0 with si ∈ Ei in terms of Kodaira maps ΦEi .
For the product of projective spaces PE = P(E1∗ ) × . . . × P(Ek∗ ) let pi : PE → P(Ei∗ ) be the natural
projection on the i-th factor. Each function si ∈ Ei defines a hyperplane Hsi on P(Ei∗ ), with slight abuse
of notation let us denote its preimage under pi by the same letter. Let ΦE : X → PE be the product of
Kodaira maps and YE = ΦE (X) be its image. In this notation the zero set Zs is given by
Zs =

Φ−1
E

YE ∩

k
\

!

i=1

Therefore for any collection of linear series E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) on X one can associate an injective
collection Ee on YE , where Ee is the restriction of E1 , . . . , Ek to YE such that
Zs = Φ−1
E (Ze
s ).
7

Proposition 2.2. Let X be an irreducible algebraic variety over C and E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) be an overdetermined collection of linear systems on X, let J be the essential subcollection of E. Let also Xa be a fiber of
ΦJ passing through a point a ∈ X. Then for generic a ∈ X, the restriction of the collection EJ c = (Ei )i∈J
/
on Xa is generically consistent.
S

Proof. Here one can take any a ∈ U , with U = X \ I⊂{1,...,k} BI as before. By Theorem 2.2 it is enough
to show that the minimal defect of the restriction of collection of linear series EJ c on Xa is nonnegative.
Let J c = {i1 , . . . , is }. By Proposition 2.1 the minimal defect of the collection of linear series EJ c , can be
computed as the minimal defect of a collection of vector subspaces
Fei∨1 (a), . . . , Fei∨s (a) ⊂ Ta∗ Xa ,

where Fei∨j is the codistribution of the restriction of Eij to Xa . The codistributions Fei∨1 , . . . , Fei∨s are given
by πJ (Fi∨1 ), . . . , πJ (Fi∨1 ), where
πJ : T ∗ U → T ∗ (Xa ∩ U ) ∼
= T ∗ U/FJ∨ ,

is the natural projection. By the second part of Theorem 2.3 we know that d(πJ (Fi∨1 ), . . . , πJ (Fi∨1 )) = 0, so
the theorem is proved.
Proof of Theorem 2.4. Without loss of generality we can assume that E is injective. Indeed, Ee is consistent
in codimension r if and only if E is consistent in codimension r.
By Proposition 2.2 we can assume that the essential subcollection of E1 , . . . , Ek is the collection itself.
We will call such collections of linear series essential. For an essential collection, by Theorem 2.3 there
exists a consistent subcollection of size τE , assume it is equal to I = {1, . . . , r}. Then the dimension τE is
equal to the dimension τI . Therefore the generic solution linear conditions from I on ΦI (X) is a union of
finitely many points.
Since linear systems Ei ’s are base-point free, the condition on the sections from Er+1 , . . . , Ek to vanish
at any of these points is union of k − r = − def(E) clearly independent linear conditions, which finishes
the proof of the theorem in this case.
We finish this section with another corollary of Proposition 2.2 which reduces the study of resultant
subvarieties to the study of resultant subvarieties of essential collections of linear systems.
Theorem 2.5. Let X be a complex irreducible quasi-projective algebraic variety and E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) be
overdetermined collection of linear systems on X with the essential subcollection J. Then the consistency
variety RE does not depend on Ei with i ∈
/ J. In other words:
RE = p−1 (REJ ), where p : E → EJ =

Y

Ei

i∈J

is the natural projection.
Proof. By Proposition 2.2 there exists a Zariski open subset W of REJ such that for any s ∈ W the
collection of linear systems J c restricted to a zero set of s is generically consistent. Therefore if V ⊂ RE is
a set of consistent systems s such that p(s) ∈ U one has codim(V ) = codim(RE ) = −d(E). Since RE is an
irreducible variety it coincides with the closure of V , which finishes the proof.

2.4

Resultant of a collection of linear series on a variety

In this subsection we will define resultant of a collection of linear series and translate results of previous
subsection to the language of resultants. The notion of resultant defined here is a generalization of Lresultant defined in [GKZ94], and most of the results are analogous to the results on L-resultants in
[GKZ94].
Let E = (E1 , . . . , En+1 ) be a collection of linear systems on an irreducible variety X of dimension n.
Assume also, that the codimension of the consistency variety RE is equal 1.
8

Lemma 2.3. Let X, E be as before, then there exists an Zariski open subset U ⊂ RE so that for any
s = (s1 , . . . , sn+1 ) ∈ U , the zero set Zs of the system s1 = . . . = sn+1 = 0 on X is finite. Moreover one
can choose U such that the cardinality of Zs is the same for any s ∈ U .
Proof. Let π1 , π2 be restrictions of two natural projections from X × E to X, E respectively to a incidence
e E . For a system s ∈ RE the zero set Zs is given by π1 (π −1 (s)), in particular if π −1 (s) is finite of
variety R
2
2
e E = dimRE , so for the generic s ∈ RE
cardinality k such is Zs . Easy dimension counting shows that dimR
the preimage π2−1 (s) is finite, and of the fixed cardinality.
Note that the conditions that codimRE = 1 and generic non-empty zero set is finite forces the number
of linear series to be n + 1.
Definition 6. Let X, E be as before, then the resultant ResE is a polynomial which defines the hypersurface
RE with multiplicity equal to the number of points in the generic non-empty zero set Zs 1 . Since RE
is irreducible such polynomial is well defined up to multiplicative constant. For (s1 , . . . , sn+1 ) ∈ E by
ResE (s1 , . . . , sn+1 ) we will denote the value of resultant on the tuple s1 , . . . , sn+1 .
The next theorem is an immediate corollary of Theorems 2.4 and 2.5. This theorem was proved by
Sturmfels in [Stu94] for equivariant linear series on an algebraic torus. In that setting resultant of a
collection of linear series on a variety is usually called sparse resultant.
Theorem 2.6. The consistency variety RE of a collection of linear systems E = (E1 , . . . , En+1 ) has
codimension 1 if and only if d(E1 , . . . , En+1 ) = −1. Moreover, if J is essential subcollection of E, then the
resultant ResE depends only on equations from Ei with i ∈ J.
For a collection E1 , . . . , En of linear series on an irreducible variety X the number of roots of a system
s1 = . . . = sn = 0 is constant for the generic si ∈ Ei . The generic number of roots of a system s1 = . . . =
sn = 0 is called the intersection index of E1 , . . . , En and is denoted by [E1 , . . . , En ].
Theorem 2.7. The resultant ResE is a quasihomogeneous polynomial with degree in the i-th entry equal
to the intersection index [E1 , . . . , Êi , . . . , En+1 ]. In particular, if J is essential subcollection of E and i ∈
/J
the degree in the i-th entry is 0.
Proof. The resultant ResE is a homogeneous polynomial in each group of variables, since a system s1 =
. . . = sn = 0 has a root on X, if and only if a system λ1 s1 = . . . = λn sn = 0 has a root for any λi ∈ C∗ .
To find the degree of ResE in the i-th entry consider
ResE (s1 , . . . , si + λs′i , . . . , sn+1 )
as a polynomial of λ for the fixed generic choice of s1 , . . . , si , s′i , . . . , sn+1 . It is easy to see that the number
of roots of ResE (s1 , . . . , si + λs′i , . . . , sn+1 ) counting with multiplicities is equal to the number of common
roots of s1 = . . . = ŝi = . . . = sn+1 = 0, so the degree of ResE in the i-th entry is [E1 , . . . , Êi , . . . , En+1 ].

Generic non-empty zero set and reduction theorem

In this section we first study generic non-empty zero sets. In particular, we show in Theorem 3.1 that
a generic non-empty zero set given by an overdetermined collection of linear series can be also defined
as a generic zero set of generically consistent collection. Then we define a notion of equivalence of two
collections of linear systems. Informally speaking, two collections of linear systems are equivalent if they
have the same generic nonempty zero sets. We show that every generically inconsistent collection of linear
series is equivalent to a collection of minimal defect −1.
1
In some places ([BEM00, Stu94]) the resultant is defined as unique up to constant irreducible polynomial defining RE ,
but the definition provided here seems more natural. See [Est07, Est10, DS15] for details.

3.1

Zero sets of essential collection of linear systems

First, we will study essential collections of linear series i.e. collections E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) such that def(J) >
d(E) for any J {1, . . . , k}.
Let Y ⊂ PE = P(E1∗ ) × . . . × P(Ek∗ ) be an irreducible variety of dimension d. For a subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}
Q
denote by PJ the product i∈J P(Ei ) and by πJ the natural projection P(E∗ ) → PJ . With slight abuse
of notation let us denote the restriction of this projection on Y also by πJ and by YJ the image of the
restricted map. Assume also, that E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) is an essential collection of linear systems on Y with
a consistent subcollection J of size d which exists by Theorem 2.3 and Proposition 2.1.
Lemma 3.1. In the situation above for the generic pair of points x1 , x2 ∈ YJ the sets Fxi = πJ c (πJ−1 (xi )),
for i ∈ {1, 2} are disjoint.
Proof. The condition on sets Fx1 and Fx2 to be disjoint is open in the space of pairs, so since Y is irreducible
it is enough to show that there exists at least one pair x1 , x2 with Fx1 ∩ Fx2 = ∅.
Assume otherwise, then for a given point x0 ∈ YJ there exists an preimage y0 ∈ πJ−1 (x0 ) and an open
set U ∈ YJ such that for any x ∈ U there exists y ∈ πJ−1 (x) with πJ c (y) = πJ c (y0 ). So there exists a section
s : U → Y of πJ defined by s(x) = y with a property that πJ c ◦ s is a constant map on U . But since πJ
is a finite morphism, the image s(U ) is an Zariski open in Y , and, therefore πJ c is constant on Y , which
contradicts the essentiallity of E1 , . . . , Ek .
The main result of this subsection is the following proposition.
Proposition 3.1. Let E1 , . . . , Ek be an essential collection of linear systems on a quasi-projective irreducible variety X. Then for the generic point s ∈ RE , the zero set Zs of a system given by s is a single
fiber of the Kodaira map ΦE .
Proof. As in subsection 2.3 we can assume that E is injective by replacing X with YE = ΦE (X) ⊂ PE =
Q ∗
i Ei . Note that the collection E restricted to YE is still essential.
Therefore, it is enough to show that for an irreducible variety YE ⊂ PE so that E is an essential collection
on YE , and for the generic choice of s ∈ RE the intersection Y ∩ Hs1 ∩ . . . ∩ Hsk is a point.
Let J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} be consistent subcollection of size τE , J c be its complement and let πJ , πJ c be two
natural projections restricted to YE :

The generic intersection YJ ∩ ( i∈J Hsi ) is nonempty and finite, and hence of the same cardinality. It is

enough to show that for for generic choice of si ’s with i ∈ J there are no two points x, y in YJ ∩ ( i∈J Hsi )
−1
with pJ c (p−1
J (x)) ∩ pJ c (pJ (y)) 6= ∅. Indeed, in such a case any two points in the finite intersection

would be separated by generic hyperplanes Hsi ’s with i ∈

T
Let the cardinality of the generic intersection YJ ∩ ( i∈J Hsi ) be equal to r, we will show that for the
generic r-tuple of points x1 , . . . , xr the sets Fxi = πJ c (πJ−1 (xi )), for i = 1, . . . , r are mutually disjoint. Since
this condition is open in the space of tuples x1 , . . . , xr and YJ is irreducible it is enough to show that there
exist at least one tuple with such property.

10

Assume otherwise, that for any tuple x1 , . . . , xr the sets Fxi , for i = 1, . . . , r are not mutually disjoint.
This is only possible if for any pair of point x1 , x2 the sets Fx1 , Fx2 are not disjoint, but this contradicts
Lemma 3.1 since YE satisfy its conditions.
Remark 3.1. The condition of collection E to be essential is sufficient for the statements of Lemma 3.1 and
Proposition 3.1 but not necessary. Indeed, consider a pair (X, E) with X = P1 × P1 and E = (E1 , E2 , E3 ),
where
E1 = E2 = H 0 (X, O(k, 0)), E2 = H 0 (X, O(0, l)), for k, l > 0.
The collection E is overdetermined, injective but not essential, since d(E) = −1 and def(E1 , E2 ) = −1.
The system
s1 = s2 = s3 = 0 si ∈ Ei
(2)
has a root on X if and only if
s1 = s2 = 0

si ∈ Ei

(3)

has a root. The zero set of generic consistent system (3) is p × P1 and therefore, the zero set of generic
consistent system (2) is l distinct points. In particular, if l > 1, the generic non-empty zero set of system (2)
is not a single fiber of the Kodaira map as E is an injective system. But if l = 1 the generic consistent
system (2) has one root, so its zero set is a single fiber of Kodaira map.
In the toric case, the sufficient and necessary condition for generic non empty zero set to be a single
fiber of the Kodaira map was obtained in [Mon19, Theorem 2.2]. This result is based on classification of
systems of Laurent polynomials which have only one root obtained in [EG15].

3.2

Generic non-empty zero set

In this subsection we study the generic non-empty zero set of a system of equations s1 = . . . = sk = 0 with
si ∈ Ei . First let us summarize results of the last two sections on the generic non-empty zero set Zs .
Theorem 3.1. Let E be an overdetermined collection of linear series on an irreducible variety X, with
the essential subcollection J. Then for the generic consistent system s ∈ RE , the zero set Zs is the generic
zero set of the collection EJ c = (Ei )i∈J
/ restricted to a fiber of a Kodaira map ΦJ .
Proof. By Theorem 2.5 and Proposition 3.1 the zero set of a generic consistent system s ∈ RE is the zero
set of a generic system EJ c = (Ei )i∈J
/ restricted to a unique fiber of the Kodaira map ΦJ . Moreover, such
a restriction is generically consistent by Proposition 2.2.
Theorem 3.1 expresses the zero set of a system generic in the space of consistent systems defined by the
collection E as the zero set of the system which is generic in the space of all systems defined by collection
EJ c restricted to a fiber of ΦJ . We will use this result in coming sections to reduce questions about topology
of generic non-empty zero set to questions about topology of generic zero set.
Proposition 3.2. Let f : X → Y be a morphism between two algebraic varieties with X - smooth. Then,
the generic fiber is smooth.
Proof. Since the condition is local in Y we can assume Y to be affine. By the Noether normalization lemma
there exists a finite morphism g : Y → Ck , with k = dimY . By the Bertini theorem the generic fiber of
the composition g ◦ f : X → Ck is smooth. But since the generic fiber of g ◦ f is a finite union of disjoint
fibers of f , the generic fiber of f is also smooth.
Theorem 3.2. Let X be smooth algebraic variety and let E1 , . . . , Ek be base-point free linear systems on
X. Then for generic consistent k-tuple s = (s1 , . . . , sk ) ∈ RE , the zero set Zs is smooth. Moreover, the
arithmetic genus of Zs is constant for a generic choice of s.

11

Proof. Let π1 , π2 be two natural projections from X × E to X, E respectively. Denote by π1 , π2 also their
e E . For a system s ∈ RE the zero set Zs is given by π1 (π −1 (s)), in
restrictions to a incidence variety R
2
−1
e E is smooth (R
e E is a vector bundle over X), the fiber of π2
particular is isomorphic to π2 (s). But since R
over the generic point s ∈ RE is smooth by Proposition 3.2, and therefore such is the generic zero set Zs .
For the second part notice that any algebraic morphism to an irreducible variety is flat over Zariski
open subset. So for some Zariski open U ⊂ RE the projection π2−1 (U ) → U is a flat family. The statement
then follows from a fact that arithmetic genus is constant in flat families.

3.3

Reduction theorem

In this subsection we will formulate and prove the Reduction theorem. First we define what does it mean
for two collections of linear systems to be equivalent.
Definition 7. Two collections E1 , . . . , Ek and W1 , . . . , Wl of linear systems on a quasi-projective irreducible
variety X are called quivalent if there exist Zariski open subsets U ⊂ RE and V ⊂ RW such that for any
u ∈ U there exists v ∈ V (and for any v ∈ V there u ∈ U ) such that the zero sets Xu and Xv coincide.
Theorem 3.3 (Reduction theorem). Any collection E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) of generically inconsistent linear
series is equivalent to some collection W of minimal defect −1. Moreover, if d(E) = −d and EJ =
(E1 , . . . , Er ) is an essential subcollection of E, then W can be defined as
W1 = . . . = Wr−d+1 = EJ ,

Wr−d+2 = Er+1 , . . . , Wk−d+1 = Ek .

Proof. First note that collections EJ = (E1 , . . . , Er ) and WK = (W1 , . . . , Wr−d+1 ) are equivalent collections
which are the essential subcollections of E and W respectively. Indeed, since both collections are essential,
by Proposition 3.1 they are equivalent if and only if generic fibres of their Kodaira maps coincide. But this
follows directly from the fact that W1 = . . . = Wr−d+1 = EJ = E1 · . . . · Er .
Therefore, we have two collections E and W with equivalent essential subcollections J = (E1 , . . . , Er )
and K = (W1 , . . . , Wr−d+1 ) and coinciding complements:
EJ c = (Er+1 , . . . , Ek ) = (Wr−d+2 , . . . , Wk−d+1 ) = WK c .
But any two such collections are equivalent since the zero set Zu of a generic system is a solution of the
system compliment to the essential subsystem restricted to the zero set of the essential subsystem.

Equivariant linear systems on homogeneous varieties

This section is devoted to the study of G-invariant linear systems on a complex variety X with a transitive
G-action. First, we work with general homogeneous space and prove Theorem 4.1 which reduces the study
of generic non-empty zero sets of overdetermined systems to the study of generic complete intersections.
We apply then this result to obtain Theorem 4.2 which together with results of [KK16] provides a
strategy for computation of discrete invariants of generic non-empty zero set of a system of equations
associated to a collection of overdetermined linear series on a spherical homogeneous space.

4.1

Linear systems on homogeneous varieties

In this subsection we will study some general results on linear systems on homogeneous varieties. The main
result of this subsection is a reduction of an overdetermined collection of linear series to several isomorphic
generically consistent collections.

Let G be a connected algebraic group, and X = G H be a G-homogeneous space. Let us denote by
x0 ∈ X the class
of identity element e · H ∈ G H. Let L1 , . . . , Lk be globally generated G-linearized line

bundles on G H. For each i = 1, . . . , k let Ei be a nonzero G-invariant linear system for Li i.e. Ei is a
finite dimensional G-invariant subspace of H 0 (X, Li ).
12



Each EJ is G-invariant and hence it is base-point free on G H. Thus the Kodaira map ΦJ is defined on
the whole G H. Since E1 , . . . , Ek are G-invariant, EJ∗ is a linear representation of G for any J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}
and, therefore, there is a natural action of G on P(EJ∗ ). It is easy to see that the Kodaira map ΦJ
is equivariant for this action. Therefore, the image ΦJ (X) is a quasi-projective homogeneous G-variety
isomorphic to G (GΦJ (x0 ) ), where GΦJ (x0 ) is a stabilizer of ΦJ (x0 ) ∈ P(EJ∗ ). For J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} we will
denote the stabilizer GΦJ (x0 ) by ΓJ ⊂ G.
Definition 8. Two collections of G-invariant linear systems E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ), E ′ = (E1′ , . . . Ek′ ) on homogeneous spaces X, X ′ respectively are isomorphic if there exists an G equivariant isomorphism f : X → X ′ and
an isomorphism of G-linearized line bundles φi : Li → f ∗ L′i for any i = 1, . . . , k such that φ∗i ◦ f ∗ (Ei′ ) = Ei .
Proposition 4.1. Let ΦJ : X → P(EJ∗ ) and ΓJ be as before then:
(i) for any y ∈ ΦJ (X) the fiber Fy := Φ−1
has a structure of ΓJ -variety;
J (y)

(ii) any fiber Fy is isomorphic to Fy0 ∼
= ΓJ H as ΓJ -variety;
(iii) for any G equivariant linear system V on X and any point y ∈ ΦJ (X) the restriction E|Fy is ΓJ invariant. Moreover, a pair Fy , V Fy is isomorphic to the pair Fy0 , V Fy .
0

Proof. For parts (i) and (ii) let Gy be the stabilizer of a point y ∈ ΦJ (X), then the fiber Fy is an
homogeneous Gy variety. But also Gy is conjugate to ΓJ , i.e. Gy = gΓJ g−1 for some g ∈ G. Then an
equivariant isomorphism between Fy0 and Fy (which also will define ΓJ on Fy ) can be defined by
ΓJ × Fy0 → Gy × Fy ,

(γ, p) 7→ (gγg−1 , gp).

Part (iii) follows directly from the construction above and the fact that linear system V is G-invariant.
By Proposition 4.1, any fiber of the Kodaira map associated to a G-invariant linear series is a homogeneous variety and in particular is smooth. Therefore, irreducible components of fibers coincide with
connected components. Next proposition is a more precise version of Proposition 4.1, which deals with
connected components of fibers of the Kodaira map.
Proposition 4.2. Let ΦJ : X → P(EJ∗ ) and ΓJ be as before then:
(i) connected components of fibres of ΦJ have a structure of Γ0J -variety;
(ii) any two connected
components of any two fibres are isomorphic as Γ0J -varieties and, in particular are
 0
0
isomorphic to ΓJ (ΓJ ∩ H), where Γ0J is the connected component of identity in ΓJ ;
(iii) for any G equivariant linear system V on X and two connected components C1 , C2 of any two fibres,
the restrictions E C1 , E C2 are Γ0J -invariant. Moreover, pairs C1 , V C1 and C2 , V C2 are isomorphic.
Proof. Most of the proof is absolutely analogous to the proof of Proposition 4.1. The only statement
which needs clarification is that any connected component of a fiber is isomorphic to Γ0J (Γ0J ∩ H). By
Proposition 4.1 it is enough to check thisfor a connected component of a given fiber, say Fy0 . The rest
easily follows from the fact that Fy0 = ΓJ H.

For a subcollection
J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} we will call the number of connected components of a fiber of the

Kodaira map ΦJ : G H → P(EJ∗ ) the index of J and denote it by ind(J). One can describe ind(J) in a
group theoretic way, this description clarifies the term “index”.
Connected components of identity Γ0J , H 0 are
normal subgroups of groups ΓJ , H respectively. There
 0
exists a natural homomorphism between i : H H → ΓJ Γ0J induced by the inclusion of H ⊂ ΓJ . The
homomorphism
i is well-defined since H 0 is a subgroup of Γ0J . It is easy to see that connected components

of ΓJ H and hence of any other fiber of ΦJ are in one to one correspondence with elements of the coset
set
.


(ΓJ Γ0J ) i(H H 0 ),




i.e. ind(J) is equal to the index of i(H H 0 ) in ΓJ Γ0J .
13



Theorem 4.1. Let X = G H be a homogeneous space and let E1 , . . . , Ek be G - invariant linear systems
on X, with the essential subcollection J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}. Then the zero set Xs for generic s ∈ RE is a disjoint
union of ind(J) subvarieties Y1 , . . . , Yind(J) . Moreover, for any i = 1, . . . , ind(J) Yi is a generic zero set of
0
0
a collection of linear series isomorphic to EJ c = (Ei )i∈J
/ restricted to ΓJ (ΓJ ∩ H).
Proof. By Theorem 3.1 the zero set Zs of a generic consistent system given by s ∈ RE is the zero set of
a generic system EJ c restricted to the fiber of the Kodaira map ΦJ . But by Proposition 4.2 connected
components with the restrictions of the collection EJ c to them are isomorphic.

4.2

Linear series in spherical varieties


In this subsection we will study G-invariant linear series on spherical varieties. A homogeneous space G H
of a reductive group
G is called spherical if some (and hence any) Borel subgroup B ⊂ G has an open

dense orbit
in G H. Starting from this point a group G will assumed to be reductive and a homogeneous

space G H will assumed to be spherical. 
Any G-invariant linear series V on G H is a representation of a reductive group G, therefore it is a
direct sum of irreducible representations:
M
Vλ .
V =
λ

It is well known that the decomposition above is multiplicity free, that is each irreducible representation
appears at most once in it. Indeed, let Vλ and Vλ′ be two different irreducible representations with the same
highest weight appearing in decomposition of V , and let s and s′ be highest weight vectors in Vλ and Vλ′
respectively. In particular, both s and s′ are B-eigensections of weight
λ of some G-linearised line bundle

′
L. Therefore the ratio s/s is a B-invariant rational function on G H. Since X has an open B-orbit we
conclude that s/s′ is constant, so Vλ = Vλ′ . The set of weights appearing in the decomposition of V is
called G-spectrum of V and is denoted by SpecG (V ). The pair of a G-linearized line bundle L and a finite
subset A of SpecG (H 0 (X, L)) determines uniquely a G-invariant linear series on X.
The main result of this subsection is Theorem 4.2 which realizes a generic non-empty zero set defined
by overdetermined collection of linear series, as a zero set, defined by generically consistent collection. In
[KK16], for a collection of linear series E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) and for a generic choice of s ∈ E, some discrete
invariants of the zero set Zs were computed in terms of combinatorics of the Newton-Okounkov polytope.
The Newton-Okounkov polytope is constructed as a polytope fibered over moment polytope with string
polytopes as fibers. The construction of Newton-Okounkov polytope depends only on G-spectra of linear
series E k (for more details see [KK16]). These results together with Theorem 4.2 provide a strategy for
computing discrete invariants of generic non-empty zero set defined by overdetermined collection of linear
series.
Lemma 4.1. Let H be a spherical subgroup of a reductive group G, let K be a connected reductive subgroup
of G which contains H (i.e H ⊂ K ⊂ G). Then H 0 is a spherical subgroup of K.
Proof. First notice that if H is spherical subgroup of G then such is H 0 so without loss of generality we
can assume that H = H 0 .


Now
consider
a
point
x
∈
K
H
⊂
G
H, there exists a Borel subgroup
B of G such that B · x is a dense


in G H. Let U be the intersection of the dense orbit B · x with K H, in other words U = (B ∩ K) · x. Note
that (B ∩ K) is consistent and therefore(B ∩ K)0 is contained in some Borel subgroupBK of K. From
the other hand, since B · x is openin G H, U is open and dense in K H, and since K H is irreducible
the orbit (B ∩ K)0 · x is dense in K H. We conclude that the orbit BK · x is dense in K H as BK contain
(B ∩ K)0 .


Proposition 4.3. Let E1 , . . . , Ek be G-invariant linear systems on a spherical homogeneous space G H and
ΓJ be a reductive group for some J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}. Then the connected components of fibers of the Kodaira
map ΦJ are isomorphic spherical homogeneous spaces. Moreover, for any G-invariant linear series V , all
restrictions of V to connected components of fibers are isomorphic.
14

Proof. By part (ii) of Proposition 4.2 connected
components of the fibers of the Kodaira map ΦJ are

homogeneous spaces which are isomorphic to Γ0J (Γ0J ∩H), and since Γ0J is reductive by Lemma 4.1 they are
also spherical. The last statement of the above proposition is identical to part (iii) of Proposition 4.2.


Theorem 4.2. Let E = (E1 , . . . , Ek ) and G H be as before. Let also J be the essential subcollection of E
such that ΓJ is a reductive group. Then for the generic system s ∈ RE the zero set Zs is a disjoint union
of ind(J) varieties Y1 , . . . , Yind(J) . Moreover, subvarieties
Yj ’s are defined by isomorphic Γ0J -invariant
 0
0
collections of linear series on the spherical variety ΓJ (ΓJ ∩ H).

Proof. By Theorem 4.1 the zero set Zs of a generic consistent system s ∈ RE is a union of ind(J) subvarieties
Y1 , . . . , Yind(J) , with Yj ’s defined by isomorphic Γ0J -invariant collections of linear series on connected components
of Kodaira map ΦJ . But connected components of Kodaira map ΦJ are spherical and isomorphic

to Γ0J (Γ0J ∩ H) by Proposition 4.3.

Corollary 4.1. In the situation above, the arithmetic genus g(Zs ) of the generic non-empty zero set Zs
could be computed as
g(Zs ) = ind(J)g(Yi ),

for any i = 1, . . . , ind(J), and can be computed in terms combinatorics
of Newton-Okounkov polytopes.
 0
0
If in addition all linear series from collection EJ c restricted to ΓJ (ΓJ ∩ H) are injective, mixed Hodge
numbers hp,0 (Zs ) of the generic non-empty zero set Zs can be computed as
hp,0 (Zs ) = ind(J)hp,0 (Yi ),
for any i = 1, . . . , ind(J), and can be computed in terms combinatorics of Newton-Okounkov polytopes.
Proof. Corollary follows immediately from Theorem 4.2 and Theorems 1 and 2 of [KK16].
Theorem 4.2 involves condition on ΓJ to be reductive, the following theorem provides a geometric
criterion for a subgroup of a reductive group to be reductive.
Theorem 4.3 ([Tim11]). Let G
be a reductive algebraic group then a closed subgroup H of G is reductive

if and only if the coset space G H is an affine algebraic variety.

Remark 4.1. The condition on ΓJ to be reductive is quite restrictive. However, for any triple H ⊂ K ⊂ G
where H is a spherical subgroup of G and K is reductive, one can realize K as ΓJ for some collection of Ginvariant linear series on G/H. Indeed, let π : G/H → G/K be natural projection and let E = (E1 , . . . , Ek )
be an injective (i.e. such that EJ is very ample) essential collection of G-invariant linear system on G/K.
Then the pullback collection π ∗ E = (π ∗ E1 , . . . , π ∗ Ek ) is an essential collection of linear series on G/H with
ΓJ = K. The classification of all such triples H ⊂ K ⊂ G follows from several works. Following ideas from
[Lun01] in [Los09] spherical subgroups were classified. The classification of spherical reductive subgroups
was obtained in [BP15]. And finally, the containment relation between spherical subgroups was obtained
in [Hof18].

Example

In this subsection we will give a concrete example of an application of Theorem 4.2. We will work with
homogeneous space GLn /U . Let E = (E1 , E2 , E3 ) be a collection of linear series with
E1 = E2 = Span(c, detk ),
where c is a constant function, detk (g · U ) = det(g)k , and E3 is a very ample linear series.
The minimal defect of E is −1, the essential subcollection is J = {1, 2}, and ΓJ = SLn [k], where

Therefore, a connected component of a fiber of the Kodaira map ΦJ is isomorphic to SLn /U and the
number of connected components of a fiber is ind(J) = k.
It follows by Theorem 4.2 that the generic non-empty zero set Zs of a system s1 = s2 = s3 = 0 is a union
of k subvarieties Y1 , . . . , Yk such that each of Yi is a hypersurface in SLn /U cut out by a generic section
s ∈ E3 |SLn /U . In particular geometric genus and mixed Hodge numbers hp,0 of Zs could be computed using
results of [KK16].

Linear series on Algebraic Torus

In this section we study equivariant linear series on (C∗ )n . The results of this section were previously
published in [Mon17] and included here for completeness of exposition. We will start with some notations
and definitions. With a Laurent polynomial f in n variables one can associate its support supp(f ) ⊂ Zn
which is the set of exponents of monomials having non-zero coefficient in f and its Newton polyhedra
∆(f ) ⊂ Rn which is the convex hull of supp(f ) in Rn . For a finite set A ⊂ Zn , let EA be a vector space of
Laurent polynomials with support in A. It is easy to see that any equivariant linear series on (C∗ )n is of
the form EA for some A and that A is a (C∗ )n -spectrum of EA .
Any connected algebraic subgroup of (C∗ )n is an algebraic torus, in particular such is group Γ0J . Therefore, Theorem 4.2 has a much nicer form in the case of equivariant linear series on (C∗ )n .
Theorem 5.1. Let A = (A1 , . . . , Ak ) be a collection of finite subsets of Zn and Ei = EAi be corresponding
linear systems on (C∗ )n . Let J the essential subcollection of E1 , . . . , Ek . Then for the generic consistent
system s ∈ RE the zero set Zs is a disjoint union of ind(J) subvarieties each of which is defined by a
generic system given by isomorphic collections of linear systems on algebraic torus.
In the toric case Theorem 5.1 can be formulated much more concretely. This will allow us to find discrete
invariants of a generic non-empty zero set explicitly. We give an example of such result in Theorem 5.3. To
state a concrete version of Theorem 5.1 we would need more notations. For a collection A = (A1 , . . . , Ak )
of finite subsets of Zn and subcollection J let
• AJ be the Minkowski sum

P

i∈J

Ai ;

• L(J) be a vector subspace of Rn parallel to the affine span of AJ and πJ : Rn → Rn /L(J) be the
natural projection;
• Λ(J) = L(J) ∩ Zn the lattice of integral points in L(J);
• GJ the group generated by all the differences of the form (a − b) with a, b ∈ Ai for any i ∈ J;
• ind(GJ ) the index of GJ in Λ(J).
Theorem 5.2. Let A = (A1 , . . . , Ak ) be a collection of finite subsets of Zn and Ei = EAi be corresponding
linear systems on (C∗ )n , let also J the essential subcollection of E1 , . . . , Ek . Then
(i) The defect of a collection of linear series def(J) (in the sense of Definition 3) is equal to the defect of
the vector subspaces def(L(Ai ))i∈J (in the sense of Definition 4);
(ii) The number ind(J) of connected components of a fiber of Kodaira map ΦJ is equal to the index ind(GJ );
(iii) for the generic consistent system s ∈ RE the zero set Zs is a disjoint union of ind(J) subvarieties each
of which is given by a generic system with the same supports (πJ (Ai ))i∈J
/ .
Proof. For the proof see Section 4 of [Mon17] and in particular proof of Theorem 18.
The following Theorem is an example of the application of Theorem 5.2.

Theorem 5.3 ([Mon17] Theorem 20). Let A1 , . . . , An+k ⊂ Zn be such that d(A) = −k and J be the unique
essential subcollection. Then the zero set Yf of the generic consistent system has dimension 0, and the
number of points in Yf is equal to
(n − #J + k)! · ind(J) · V ol(πJ (∆i )i∈J
/ ),
where ∆i is the convex hull of Ai and V ol is the mixed volume on Rn /L(J) normalized with respect to the
lattice Zn /Λ(J).
If k = 0 this theorem coincides with the BKK Theorem. In the case k = 1 the generic number of
solution appears as the corresponding degree of sparse resultants and was computed in [DS15]. In a similar
fashion, Theorem 5.2 could be applied to the computation of any other discrete invariants which can be
computed by means of Newton polyhedra theory.
