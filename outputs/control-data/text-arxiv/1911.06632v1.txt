Abstract— Singularity is robot controls is an important
problem. By identifying an appropriate trajectory for the
robots, the singular situations can be avoided. In this paper an
identification algorithm is proposed to control the robot such
that it can change its direction to avoid the singularity situation.
Base on the singular value decomposition, the proposed
algorithm is developed for the non-redundant, single-rank
robots. The proposed method is employed on a robot with
six degrees of freedom, in order to identify its feasible trajectory.
Keywords: Singularity; Trajectory identification; Robot control; Identification algorithm; Singular value decomposition.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Singularity occurrence in robot manipulators is considered
as one of the challenging issues. In a singular situation, a
robot may lose one or more degrees of freedom; meaning
that the states in some directions will be zero [1-6]. The
singularity may cause infinity speed in some joint. The
directions which are affected by the singularity are known as
the singular directions. In terms of a singularity in a joint,
order reduction will happen in the Jacobian matrix. This order
reduction will cause the matrix to be irreversible. Therefore,
the control of the robot with irreversible Jacobian matrix will
be extremely problematic [7-19].
Several researchers have investigated the robot singularity
in different ways. In [7], the robot joint velocities in singular
situation have been surveyed; however, the authors only
considered the perpendicular directions when a singularity
happens, to determine the feasible paths. In another study
[8], the authors have studied several control algorithms to
control the robot’s singularity; the methods are based on
the inverse kinematic approach. One of the most important
problems in robot singularity is that, the robot tends to move
toward the singular direction once a singularity happens.
To solve this issue, in this paper, we will analyze the robot
trajectory in singular situation, and we will determine a
feasible trajectory to avoid singularity through a proposed
identification algorithm. In the proposed approach, through
the identification algorithm, we will identify the possible
paths once the singularity happens. Then, the robot will be
directed to the trajectories that help it to avoid the singularity.
The developed algorithm in this paper is based on the
singular value decomposition method. The feasible paths
in this method are the ones that result in finite outputs for
the finite inputs (guarantees stability). Authors in [9] have
proposed a similar approach based on strong equivalency for
an electric network. They have identified the system through
their proposed identification algorithm, such that they can
guarantee avoiding singularity in the system.
In the rest of the paper, you will read section II which

explains the mathematical formulation of the singular model,
and the singular velocity model for the robot. Section III
contains the identification of feasible paths in singularity.
The proposed method is implemented on a robot with six
degrees of freedom in section IV. Eventually, section V is the
conclusion section.
II. M ATHEMATICAL M ODEL D EFINITION
As stated in the previous section, singularity results in
irreversible Jacobian matrix, due to the matrix order reduction.
The relationship between the velocity of joints and velocity of
the end-points is represented as Eq. 1 [10-17]. In the following
equation, J is the Jacobian matrix, q̇ represents the velocity
of joints, and Ẋ denotes the velocity of the end-points, n
represents the number of joints, and m is the number of degrees
of freedom.
Ẋ = J × q̇

(1)

Based on the singular value decomposition method, the
Jacobian matrix can be decomposed into the multiply of three
matrices as Eq. 2. Moreover, the V = [v1 , v2 , ..., vn ] matrix is
a perpendicular matrix which is the multiply of matrices J
and J T . We want to mentio that, the parameters can be tuned
through the adaptive or fuzzy algorithms as in [15] and [17].
J = U × ∑V T

(2)

Furthermore, U contains the eigen vectors of J × J T . Matrix
∑ can be defined also as Eq. 3.

∑ = diag( σ1 , σ2 , ..., σr )

(6)

In a singularity case, σ1 , σ2 , ..., σm = 0. Therefore, the last
columns of U matrix (from ur+1 to um ) are zero. The singular
direction here is determined based on the direction of um .
Thus, we have the following equation.
d˙ = um T × Ẋ

(7)

In the above equation, Ẏ denotes the m − 1 non-singular
vectors, and d˙ is the velocity vector in a singular direction.
Thus, Eq. 1 can be rephrased as Eq. 8.
Ẏ = K × q̇
d˙ = L × q̇

Ẏ = K p × q˙p + Ks × q˙s

Also, from the previous equations, we have
q̇ = M × Ẏ + N × q˙s . Eventually, the equation for the
acceleration in the singular direction is attained as Eq. 13.
Matrices A, B, and C are defined as Eq. 14.
d¨ = q˙s T × A × q˙s + B × q˙s +C

B = Ẏ × M T (θ × LT + θ × L) × N
C = Ẏ T × M T × θ × L × M × Ẏ

III. I DENTIFICATION OF F EASIBLE PATHS
By derivation of Eq. 8, and knowing that L = 0, d˙ = 0, the
singular acceleration is represented as:
dL
q̇ = (q̇T × θ × LT ) × q̇

Having the above equations, we can analyze the singular
situations with non-zero acceleration. here, we are analyzing
the singularity in robots. Since the number of degrees of
freedom in robots is equal to the number of end-points, the
q˙s vector will be an scalar, and Eq. 15 is attained.

According to Ẏ matrix in Eq. 8, the K matrix is a full-rank
matrix, with rank = m − 1. It can be defined as Eq. 25. K p in
this equation is a reversible square matrix, with m − 1 number
of rows and columns, and Ks is a matrix with dimension
(m − 1) × [(n − m + 1)].
(11)

The q̇ matrix also can be decomposed into q̇ p and q̇s with
(m − 1), and (n − m + 1) dimensions respectively. Therefore,

(15)

In this paper, we assume that robot is in the beginning of
its path and the singularity occurs. Therefore, Ẏ (0) = 0. Based
on Eq. 14, matrices B and C will be zero too. Therefore, we
will have the Equation below. If A in Eq. 16 is non-zero,
the acceleration sign will be the same as A matrix sign.
This means that the end-point will be the same sign as A.
If A matrix is positive, the end-point will be in the same
direction of the singularity, and if it is negative, it will be in
the adverse singularity direction. Therefore, we will pick the
paths in which the acceleration sign in a singular situation
is equal to matrix A sign. If A is zero, Eq. 16 will be as
d¨ = 0, which means that the robot can not move with any
acceleration value in the singular situation. As you could see,
based on the matrix A values, we can analyze the possible
paths once a singularity happens.
d¨ = A × q̇2s

K = [K p , Ks ]

In the above equation, K and L are the sub-matrices
of U T × J. In a singular situation, d˙ is zero, and L is also
zero. We should mention that the velocity matrix q̇ is non-zero.

IV. P ROPOSED PATH I DENTIFICATION S TRATEGY ON A
ROBOT WITH S IX D EGREES OF F REEDOM
In this section, our proposed path identification strategy is
applied to a robot with six degrees of freedom. The robot is
presented in Fig. 1, which has one vertical degree, and five
circular degrees of freedom. The robot parameters are shown
in Table I.
The Jacobian matrix for this robot will be as follows.

σ1 = 0.5 × (a2 2 + 2d4 2 + 2a2 d4 S3 ) + (a2 2 + 2d4 2 + 2a2 d4 S3 )2

The singular values of the σ1 and σ2 are always positive
and non-zero, therefore, the singular situation for the first
three degrees of freedom happens only when σ3 is zero;
σ3 = kπ + π2 . The Jacobian matrix J11 in a singular situation
will be as the following equation. The ε value is 1 if k is
even, and -1, if k is odd value.

Since, matrix J12 is a zero matrix, the first three degrees
of freedom are independent of the next two other degrees of
freedom, and the solutions are independent of each other. The
first three degrees of freedom eigen values would be as Eq. 22.

Considering that A is always non-zero, and the acceleration
in a singular direction follows the sign of A matrix, the
possible paths are the ones that the acceleration sign is the
same as h parameter sign in Eq. 30.
d4 + a2 ε
h=−
(30)
a2 d4 ε

We conclude that if the h sign is positive, the robot can
avoid singularity in the direction of the singular eigen vector.
If h is negative, the robot will escape the singularity advers
of the direction of the singular eigen vector. The mentioned
diretions are considered as the limits for the robot.
Also. from Eq. 29, if parameters d4 and a2 are equal and ε
is equal to -1, the A matrix is zero. In this situation, there is
no feasible path for the robot to avoid singularity. The same
calculations are applied to the other/rest of degrees of freedom.

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, feasible paths are detected to help the robot
avoid singularities. The limit of this identification procedure
are analyzed, and the proposed strategy is employed on a robot
with six degrees of freedom. In this study, we assumed that
the singularity happens when the robot is in the beginning of
its path. The identification algorithm developed is based on the
singular value decomposition method. The proposed strategy
was very efficient and helpful in guiding the robot to avoid
the singularity situation.
