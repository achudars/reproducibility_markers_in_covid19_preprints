We suggest a geometrical mechanism for the ordering of slender filaments inside non-isotropic
containers, using cortical microtubules in plant cells and packing of viral genetic material inside
capsids as concrete examples. We show analytically how the shape of the cell affects the ordering
of phantom, non-self-avoiding, elastic rods. We find that for oblate cells the preferred orientation
is along the equator, while for prolate spheroids with an aspect ratio close to one, the orientation
is along the principal (long axis). Surprisingly, at high enough aspect ratio, a configurational phase
transition occurs, and the rods no longer point along the principal axis, but at an angle to it, due to
high curvature at the poles. We discuss some of the possible effects of self avoidance, using energy
considerations. These results are relevant to other packing problems as well, such as spooling of
filament in the industry or spider silk inside water droplets.

Packing of filaments inside volumes of a given shape is an important problem in many fields. From packing of
genetic material inside viral capsids[1–5], through ordering of micro-tubules near plant cell walls[6–8], to spooling of
filaments in industrial application [9–11] and other biopolymers such as spider silk [12–15]. These type of problems
are hard as they typically involve a compromise between elastic energy and entropic constraints. As a result, most
approaches to these problems involve highly symmetric volumes and are mostly numerical. This paper’s aim is to
gain further analytical understanding of systems which are not highly symmetric, using differential geometry, study
of entropic efects and self avoidance is largely postponed to a later paper. As concrete examples, we consider plant
cells where shape regulation is important and microtubules play a significant role and the packing of genetic material
inside viral capsids. While these two examples seem very different, both are essentially problems of packing long
semi-flexible filaments. Additionally, the authors hope that this work will serve as an inspiration for applying similar
methods from differential geometry to study other systems, and not only the packing of filaments on surfaces.
In the context of plant tissue, the confinement of microtubules (MT) in the cell membrane, and especially, the
possible transition from disordered to partially ordered packing is thought to be the origin of important morphogenetic
and growth regulating mechanisms. The location of leaves on the stem, anisotropic cell expansion, as in roots and
stems, and the evolution of anisotropic mechanical properties of extended leaf tissue are few examples in which
mechanical and geometrical asymmetries appear. In plant cells, cellulose fibrils in the cell wall are the carrier of
mechanical load. Orientation of cortical MT dictates the orientation of cellulose fibrils deposition in the cell wall
[7]. Therefore, anisotropic MT orientation would lead to anisotropic cellulose deposition, and, thus, to anisotropic
mechanical properties of the cell. This, in turn, would lead to its anisotropic growth and to shape evolution of the
tissue. But what sets MT orientation at the single cell level? The suggestion that mechanical stress directly affects
MT orientation, was supported by pointing to the correlations between MT orientation and the directions of principal
stresses in evolving meristems [6].On the other hand, it is not clear how stress or strain in the cell wall can affect the
cell membrane [16, 17]. In addition, the effect of applied stress on mechanical properties of a leaf appeared only after
a delay of several hours [18]. This suggests that an integral mechanism, which is common in other growth regulation
mechanisms [19, 20], could be in action. Alternative approaches, suggest that the cell shape, and particularly, its
anisotropy is a dominant factor in MT ordering. The two approaches are, in fact, closely related: Considering a
circular cell, an integral over the strain determines the cell’s anisotropy. We therefore pose the questions of what are
the leading effects of cell shape on the disordered-aligned transition of MT.
In the context of viral capsids there is ultimate necessity for the genetic material to be orderly packed inside the
capsid in order to assure effective infection. This is so important because once the genetic material is packed inside the
capsid it has no active sources of energy to support its injection, except for the elastic energy stored in the structure.
It has been convincingly argued [1, 2, 4] that the size of the capsid plays an important role in piloting towards an
ordered structure based on both entropic and energetic considerations, showing that active biological control over
ordering the spool could be seriously reduced. In particular, a continuous phase transition between a disordered
phase (for large capsids) and an ordered phase (for small capsids) has been found. The spontaneous formation of
virus capsids from multiple copies of capsid proteins is itself a fascinating example of supramolecular self-assembling
processes [21]. Most known viruses protect their genome with icosahedral capsids, which is often modelled as a
spherical cavity. However, other capsid morphologies exist as well, notably elongated, often ellipsoid, structures. The

bacteriophage φ29 has elongated capsids with size of about 42nm × 54nm leading to an aspect ratio of 4 : 5 [22, 23].
The capsid of archaeal virus Sulfolobus ellipsoid virus 1 (SEV1) [24] is that of a prolate ellipsoid with principal axes
of 78nm × 115nm hence aspect ratio of about 2 : 3. Other important examples include the human virus, HIV-1, where
experiments have demonstrated the self-assembly of viral capsid proteins into elongated shapes both in vitro and in
vivo [25] with varying aspect ratios depending on the precise conditions during the assembly process, notably the
interaction between the building block proteins. An interesting example is the case of extremely elongated capsids in
mutant T4 phages [26] with aspect ratios in the range 1 : 2-1 : 3 leading to a twisted toroidal configuration of DNA
inside them. An immediate question that comes to mind is: does the shape of the capsid affect the ordering phase
transition of the genetic material in the capsid compared to the spherical case? Simulations performed by different
groups [1, 9, 22, 27] indicate that packings in oblate spheroids and scalene ellipsoids are energetically preferred to
spheres. In simple words, it seems that the elongated container tends to order the structure more than a spherical
one. Furthermore, it was observed in simulations [22, 23, 28–30] that the kind of order of the genetic material changes,
and attains a nematically ordered structure with twist (also called twisted toroidal conformations [28]), as opposed
to a spool-like one in spherical capsids. The different simulations are not clear about the source of this effect. Some
suggest that the toroidal packing arranges itself along the longest possible dimension to minimize the bending stress
(and hence the elastic energy) [28], while others put more emphasis on entropic effect [31]. In this paper we want to
clarify the energetic aspects of packing an elastic rod, and in particular the enhanced ordering emanating from the
elongated geometry, while in a future publication we will focus on entropic effects.

We begin by assuming a a phantom ,i.e. non - self - avoiding, unstretchable, filament of thickness t whose midline
is given by R(s) = {X(s), Y (s), Z(s)} where s is the arclength along the rod. The bending energy of such a rod is

where Q̈ = ∂s2 Q is the second derivative of the quantity Q(s), and ε is the rod’s Young’s modulus. At zero temperature,
the rod’s configuration is the global minimizer of Eq.(1), subjected to the constraint of lying on the surface of an
ellipsoid - X 2 (s) + Y 2 (s) + Z 2 (s)/(1 + δ)2 = 1, where δ > −1 is called the flattening of the ellipsoid, and is related to
the usual definition of eccentricity e, via e2 = δ(2 + δ) [32–34]. A vanishing flattening, δ = 0, corresponds to a sphere.
Negative values of δ in the range −1 < δ < 0 describe an oblate spheroid, while positive values, δ > 0 is a prolate
spheroid. The problem of finding the global energy minimizer is difficult, as the system is clearly highly frustrated.
We therefore use a geometrical approach, and describe the rod using its curvatures rather than the configuration R.
We start by assigning a generalized Frenet - Serret frame (see [35–37]), {t1 , t2 , t3 }, being the tangent, bi-normal and
normal vectors of the rod, respectively, as follows. Given f = {X(x, y), Y (x, y), Z(x, y)}, the surface configuration
(x, y being coordinates on the surface), and n̂ the normal to the surface, we choose a local orthonormal in-plane frame
along the rod, using a Darboux frame on the surface {∂x f , ∂y f , n̂} we define the Frenet - Serret frame, {t1 , t2 , t3 },
and the in - plane surface tangent and normal vectors eµ1 and eµ2 :
t1 = Ṙ = eµ1 ∂µ f
t2 = eµ2 ∂µ f
t3 = n̂.

Orthonormality dictates, that the inner products satisfy eµ1 e1µ = aµν eµ1 eν1 = 1 = eµ2 e2µ , and eµ1 e2µ = 0, where
aµν = ∂µ f · ∂ν f is the induced metric on the surface, and µ, ν ∈ {x, y}. It is then straightforward to show that tα ,
α ∈ {1, 2} satisfy the equations,

Here bµν = ∂µ ∂ν f · n̂ is the second fundamental form of the confining surface, κg is the geodesic curvature of the rod
on the surface, and αβ is the 2 × 2 antisymmetric (Levi-Civita) symbol. Deriving Eq. (3), we used the fact that for

While this seems to be a simpler functional than the one given in Eq. (1), one must remember that l itself is a

Eq. (13) reveals an important property of the energy minimizing problem: while the normal curvature, l, is a
property of the surface, the geodesic curvature, kg , can be eliminated by a proper selection of the rod configuration.
These configurations are geodesics, which locally minimize Eq. (13). As shown later (appendix A), for any positive
flattening, δ > 0, no geodesic is a global minimizer. However, the true global minimizer cannot deviate significantly
from a geodesic (see appendix B). Therefore, we conclude geodesics are good approximations,an limit ourselves to
their study, which significantly simplifies the problem.

4
We begin by parametrising the surface of the ellipsoid using θ (polar) and φ (azimuthal) angles, and subsequently
finding the geodesics in terms of these coordinates:
X = cos φ sin θ
Y = sin φ sin θ
Z = (1 + δ) cos θ

Since the metric is independent of φ, there is a conserved, conjugate “angular momentum” ω, which is related to
the “angular velocity” φ̇ , and is the generator of rotations around the symmetry axis of the ellipsoid found by solving

initial conditions. To find geodesics we now need to integrate Eq. (21), which can be done numerically. However, by
virtue of rotational symmetry about the polar axis of the ellipsoid (aµν is independent of φ, geodesics are parametrized
by ω alone), we can disregard exact solutions of φ(s) when looking for minimizing geodesics, and we can immediately
look for a minimizer of Eq. (13) (see Eq. (30)).
Evaluating Ē on geodesics, we find that by virtue Eq. (28), instead of integrating over s we may integrate over θ

seen that for δ < 0 only ω = ±1 are the minima, this is true for every −1 < δ < 0 and ,as seen in appendix A, these
solution are stable. We therefore conclude that equatorial geodesics are the global minimizers for oblate spheroids
(see Fig. 2(a)). Not surprisingly, in the case of a sphere (δ = 0) we find that any geodesic is a global minimizer.
These results (for δ ≤ 0) are indeed very intuitive. In contrast, a more complex behaviour arises in the case of prolate
spheroids (δ > 0), where we observe a sharp transition at a critical flattening δ ∗ (Fig. 1, see Fig. 2(b) and (c) for
visualization of possible curves).
We mark by ωm (δ) the minimizer of Ē(ω, δ), and it’s energy by Ē(ωm (δ)) = Ē(ωm (δ), δ) i.e. the globally minimizing

geodesic, as a function of the flattening, δ, and plot it (Fig. 3). We find that for 0 < δ ≤ δ ∗ polar geodesics (ωm = 0)
are the minimizers of Ē, while for δ > δ ∗ , ωm (δ) 6= 0. Solving numerically the requirement that the extremum at

FIG. 1: Mean energy per unit length, Ē, of geodesics (parametrized by the angular momentum ω), for different
values of δ as indicated in the figure. All oblate spheroids (δ < 0) are qualitatively the same - polar geodesics
(ω = 0) have the maximal energy, while equatorial ones ω = ±1 are minimal. In the case of prolate spheroids δ > 0
the situation is very different: for 0 < δ < δ ∗ , ωm = 0 is the minimal geodesic, while for δ ∗ < δ, two symmetric
solutions arise ±ωm (δ), which tend to the asymptotic value ωm (∞) = 0.255 for extremely eccentric ellipsoids.

Why does this transition happen? Simply put, it is because for large δ’s, the curvature at the poles becomes very
large and dominant. Thus, the minimizing geodesic is such that it does not pass through the poles on one hand,
yet it is still mainly directed towards the poles, as to gain as much as possible from the large difference in principal
curvatures values. This result raises the question whether there is a non-geodesic solution that has a lower mean
energy even for small δ, one that does not pass through the poles. Indeed, as seen in appendix B, there must be
such a solution, yet this solution is still close to a geodesic, and in any case the solution to the real physical problem
must also take into account temperature, activity and self-avoidance. Our analysis sheds light on some aspects of the
mechanisms governing the actual shape and suggests that a proper treatment should take into account the surface’s
shape effect on the final configuration, as it serves as an ”external field” biasing the rod to align along the symmetries
of the problem.
Finally, for δ 6= 0, these solutions given above, which all have a preferred direction (i.e. they are not isotropic),
are clearly preferable to any other curve that covers the ellipsoid isotropically. Any isotropic solution, that covers
the ellipsoid, must have geodesic curvature, but for infinitely long filaments, one may create such a curve by slowly
changing ω along a curve. In this ”quasi-static” limit we change ω without introducing any geodesic curvature. Such

From Fig. 4 it is clearly seen that a directional (non isotropic) configuration is preferable compared to an isotropic
configuration, since the dashed blue line corresponding to Ēiso (δ) is higher than the red solid line describing the
energy of the globally minimizing geodesics Ē (ωm (δ)).
Before we conclude, a few words on the possible effect of self avoidance. Naturally, a full mechanical treatment of
self avoiding filaments is hard. However we may still have a few insights using our geometrical approach. We have
shown that as the ellipsoid elongates, and due to the growing curvature at the poles, a transition occurs, so that the
minimizing configuration is no longer a polar geodesic. In the presence of self avoidance, this transition is likely to
occur later, at higher values of δ, depending on the strength of the self-avoiding interaction. The reason is that a
polar geodesic - like path (see Fig. 5 a) allows (especially for thin filaments) a non-intersecting packing, in contrast

prefer to minimize the bending energy by avoiding the poles. Since any self - intersecting configuration, must do so
many times, proportionate to the filament density c, and by denoting the self - interaction energy per unit length in
u , we can express the energy of a self - crossing filament as Ē + uc (u > 0 for self - avoidance). Thus, the condition

the aforementioned transition.
Another possible effect of self avoidance is the appearance of meta-stable states, where the filament packs without
crossing, such as paths with ω ∼ 1 that wrap many times around the ellipsoid (see Fig. 5 b), but any deviation from
this configuration means that the filament must cross itself many times (Fig. 5 c). At high densities and strong self
avoiding interactions , such a configuration is likely to be meta-stable.

FIG. 5: Three examples emphasizing effect of self avoidance on prolate spheroid packing. a) a self avoiding polar
geodesic-like. b)a self avoiding equatorial geodesic - like, might be a metastable state. c) a non-self avoiding,
geodesic solution, self crossing many times.
To conclude, we have used a geometrical approach to show that the shape of an ellipsoid acts as an ”external field”
that orders the orientation of a stiff filaments on it’s surface. We have shown that energy, not only entropy, plays
a significant role in ordering the packing of filaments inside non-spherical volumes. By the use of geodesics to allow
for a simple analytical treatment, we have directly shown that in general, filaments will tend to align with the long
dimension of the ellipsoid. However, this is not completely accurate, since (at least for geodesics) the transition is
likely to occur in very long ellipsoids, where the globally bending minimizing curve no longer passes through the
poles. The transition is somewhat sensitive to the geometry,e.g. within a model of cylinder with spherical caps, no
such transition will occur as a function of elongation as the curvature does not depend on the the flattening in such
a case. Nevertheless, these results reflect similar numerical result as in [9, 40], specifically, the transition described
in this paper echoes numerical results found in the context of microtubules [22, 23, 27, 31], and the folded toroid
- to - twisted toroid transition described by [28–30] in the context of viral capsids. Additionally, most wild type
viral capsids have a relatively small flattening, which is below the transition found here, namely δ < δ ∗ . The results
shown here suggest that a too eccentric shape will make packing of genetic material not as efficient with respect to
injection into a host cell. When applied to the ordering of MT along cell walls, these results suggest that ordering
does not necessitate any biological means of actively or passively sensing stress within the cell wall. Hence, sensitivity
to stress/strain by proxi, namely the intgeral over strain, leads to anisotropy. Finally, the treatment shown here is
simplified, nor does not fully take into considerations any entropic effect and geometric effects such as self avoidance.
In any real system, temperature and/or activity play a significant role, as well as self avoidance [2, 3, 41], and should
be taken into account. Additionally, dynamics [23], friction effects [42] (both dynamic and static), plasticity of either
the membrane or the filaments [42], and electrostatics [27], were not taken into account and are likely to play roles in
different systems. In this context, the results shown here are an important stepping stone. A full statistical mechanical

treatment that takes into account both entropy and self avoidance is postponed for a later paper.

Appendix A: Stability Analysis

For stability analysis we use a somewhat different and much more technical approach than the one presented in
the main text. Most notably, we use an index - less notation, since an index notation will be much more cumbersome
and definitely more complex to read. The analysis presented here is based on standard differential geometry as can
be found, in example in [38]. It begins by rewriting our energy expression (Eq. (1)) for a general curve, parametrized
generally (Eq. (A1)), that is not necessarily using the natural parametrization of arc-length |R0 (s)| = 1. Soon after,
we rigorously define a variation of the curve on a differential manifold, which allows us to define a variational field,
which is the infinitesimal of a variation about the curve. This allows us to calculate the first and, more importantly,
the second variations of our energy functional.

ċ ≡ ∂s = ∇s c since c is a scalar defined on the ellipsoid. Note that this form of writing is almost identical to Eq.(1),

A variation, h(s, t), of a curve c(s), is a two parameter function (s ∈ [0, L], t ∈ (−, )), such that h(s, 0) = c(s),
and h(0, t) = c(0), h(L, t) = c(L). h(s, t) ≡ ct (s) for a given t is some curve meandering about c(s). The field
v(s) = ∂h
∂t (s, 0) is called the variational field. Furthermore, close to c(s), one can write h(s, t) locally, without loss of
generality , as h(s, t) = expc(s) (tv(s)). Where expp (v) ≡ γ(p, 1, v) is the exponential map about a point p (a step of

Thus, δE is zero iff either γ is an asymptotic curve (in which case B (γ̇, γ̇) is zero), or if γ is locally a principal
curve, that is tangent to the principal directions of the B. The latter can be seen by noting that around a geodesic, we
may restrict ourselves to variational fields v that are perpendicular to the curve without any loss of generality ,as any
tangent component of v translates into re-parametrization of the geodesic). As a result, if γ is also a principal curve,

Using Fourier analysis, it is easily shown that this expression is stable with respect to all variational fields v except
v = v0 exp(is), where it vanishes. This means that every variation around a geodesic (which is, by default, a principal
direction) is stable (i.e - geodesics are stable solutions) except ones which oscillate with a periodicity of the sphere’s
circumference. Such a variation is merely another (nearby) great circle (all and only great circles are geodesics on a
sphere).
By expressing B (X, Y ) for polar geodesics (ω = 0), and expanding the expressions in small δ > 0 it can be shown
that instability occurs for wave-numbers (around polar geodesics)

Appendix B: Estimation of Stable solutions

While one can produce better estimates, here we will use only a rough estimation to show that for 0 < δ  1,
κg must be small too. The logic behind this argument is as follows - it is clear that a curve on the equator will, at
least locally, prefer to point along the polar direction as the curvature is lowest along this direction. However near
the poles the curvature is larger even than that of the equatorial geodesic, it may therefore be preferential for the
curve to change direction so that it bypasses the pole, even if only slightly. In order to bound the average geodesic
curvature, we consider two cases: as an upper bound we consider a geodesic on a sphere having the same curvature as
that at the pole (lmax = 1 + δ). Clearly, any physical solution on the ellipsoid has lower energy than that, since even
a polar geodesic has lower energy. As for a lower bound we now consider some configuration (with non-zero geodesic
1
curvature) on a sphere whose curvature equals to the lowest curvature on the ellipsoid (lmin = (1+δ)
2 ). In other words

= (1 + δ)2 − 1/(1 + δ)4 ' = 6δ + O(δ 2 )  1.

This is an extremely rough estimate, but it suffices in order to support our claim that for small δ the actual minimizing
curve is almost a geodesic (and specifically a polar geodesic). Note that a localized highly curved region is not a possible
solution since for any finite deviation from a geodesic assuming a localized curvature along some scale ∆, one must
have κg ∝ 1/∆. Furthermore, from the symmetry of the problem, such regions must occur infinitely many times
along the curve (if it occurs only a finite number of times, than we must sit on a geodesic). Hence the contribution
∆→0
to the mean energy ∆Ē ∝ 1/∆2 ∆ = 1/∆ −−−→ ∞. Hence the √
globally minimizing curve must have a fairly uniform
distribution of geodesic curvature along it (i.e. κg ∼ const. ∼ 2 δ  1)
In the case of δ  1 a different argument takes over - in this limit, the polar direction has mostly zero curvature,
except at a region near the poles where it is very large. Furthermore, the azimuthal curvature in these regions is also
very high. Near the caps deviation from the polar direction is therefore also very costly (as it is much larger than 1,
the azimuthal curvature around the equatorial). Thus, a rod will prefer to avoid regions with high mean curvature
(as it is affected by both the polar and azimuthal curvatures). A reasonable criterion is that the curve will remain
(up to some penetration depth) in regions satisfying 21 Tr(S) ≤ 1. By finding the angle θ1 at which it is equal to 1

(B2)

we see that the curve is limited to a region such that θ1 ≤ θ(s) ≤ π − θ1 , primarily pointing along the ellipsoid.
Finally, direct calculation shows that θ1 ≥ 30◦ (monotonically approaching 30◦ in the limit of δ  1). Hence, while
in this case κg is not necessarily small (though it does not need to be too large either), the curve probes much of the
surface of the ellipsoid as it traverses about 2/3 of its length.

Appendix C: Self avoidance

The energy of close packed, almost polar geodesic, path on the ellipsoid, is approximated as the energy of N = 2K +1
closed paths, so that each path is numbered by |n| ≤ K, where n = 0 is the path passing through the poles, and other
paths reside in a plane parallel to it. If the filament’s thickness is given by t it is not hard to see that the distance of
each such filaments from the plane bisecting the ellipsoid through the poles is given by d = n · t. The relative distance
