Why is the Universe so homogeneous and isotropic? We summarize a general study
of a γ-law perfect fluid alongside an inhomogeneous, massless scalar gauge field (with
homogeneous gradient) in anisotropic spaces with General Relativity. The anisotropic
matter sector is implemented as a j-form (field-strength level), where j ∈ {1, 3}, and
the spaces studied are Bianchi space-times of solvable type. Wald’s no-hair theorem is
extended to include the j-form case. We highlight three new self-similar space-times:
the Edge, the Rope and Wonderland. The latter solution is so far found to exist in the
physical state space of types I,II, IV, VI0 , VIh , VII0 and VIIh , and is a global attractor
in I and V. The stability analysis of the other types has not yet been performed. This
paper is a summary of [1], with some remarks towards new results which will be further
laid out in upcoming work.
Keywords: p-form gauge fields, anisotropic space-times, Bianchi models, inflation, dynamical system, orthonormal frame.

1. Introduction
Why does the Universe seem so isotropic on large scales [2, 3, 4]? Standard
cosmology invokes this observation as a principle, as it is hard to solve the Einstein
equations without symmetry requirements [5]. In order to understand this high
degree of isotropy within the paradigm of GR, it is necessary to relive the theory
of such assumption, seeking to replace it instead by an explanation. To this end we
have softened the isotropy requirement of the cosmological principle by studying
the Bianchi models of solvable type (types I-VIIh ).
A natural generalization of massless scalar fields to the anisotropic case, is the pform fielda with p = 1 or 3. Collectively, we shall refer to this form field as a j-form
field, since the equations will be the same in either case (as explained in Section 3).
The connection to massless scalar fields may be drawn from eq. (4). In this study
we summarize some results we have obtained in our study so far, and mention a
few results to be further reported on in upcoming work(s)(Normann’s Ph.D. thesis).
We would like to refer the reader to [1] for further references to previous works on
related topics. Also, note the recent works [6, 7] and many interesting references
therein.
2. The general p-form action
A natural candidate for anisotropic matter sourcing is the one stemming from the
general p-form action [8]
a We

here and throughout reference the form field on the fieldstrength level.

Here Pµ1 ···µp are the components of P in a general basis. As evident from the above
equationsa , our study assume that there is no source to the j-form field.
General properties of the p-form action: Note that the theories derived
from the general p-form action Eq. (1) respect the following properties: (i) gauge
invariance L → L under K → K + dU, where U is a (p − 2) -form; (ii) only up
to second order derivatives in equations of motion; (iii) Lagrangian is up to second
order in field strength P; (iv) constructed by exterior derivative of a p-form and (v)
minimally coupled to gravity.
3. The j-form fluid
In our study, P is required homogeneous: P(t, x) ⇒ P(t). However, generally, the
underlying gauge field K(t, x) is allowed to vary both with space and time. Hence
we study a j-form fieldstrength with an underlying inhomogenous gauge field. This
is different from [ 9 ], where the gauge potential is a function of time only. In order
to classify the possible cases of p-form matter fields that can be constructed from
the exterior derivative of a (p − 1)-form, the following notation is introduced: {a, b}
where a denotes the rank of the p-form P and b the rank of its Hodge dual ⋆P. In
four dimensional space-time (a + b = 4) there are three distinct cases to consider:
(i){2, 2}, (ii) {3, 1} or {1, 3} and (iii) {4, 0}. The degeneracy in (ii) is due to the
symmetry of the equations Eq. (2) and Eq. (3)b . This symmetry can also be seen
in the action Eq. (1), up to a prefactor. Since these two cases yield the same set of
equations, we effectively study both cases, by studying one of them.
In the following analysis the cases {1, 3} and {3, 1} will be taken into account. In
order to include both scenarios, notation shall here, and throughout the rest of the
paper, be such that J denotes either (i) the Hodge dual of a 3-form field strength
C(t) = dB (where B(t, x) is a 2-form) or (ii) the 1-form field strength A(t) = dφ
(where φ(t, x) is a scalar field). That both cases give rise to the same equations is
evident.
a the

Hodge dual ⋆P is closed
reason why this degeneracy is not found in the case (iii) is because P 6= dK in the case
{0, 4}. Hence one is left only with {4, 0}.

These are the equations for a massless scalar field. Hence, our study can be viewed
as a study of an inhomogeneous, massless scalar field with a homogeneous gradient.
State parameter The field strength Jα may be decomposed according to
Jα = −w uα + vα ,

(7)

where the 4-velocity uα is time-like (uα uα < 0), whereas vα is defined to be orthogonal to uα and therefore space-like (vα v α > 0). The range of the equation of
state parameter ξ defined through pf = (ξ − 1)ρf a comes as no surprise. Performing
the calculations, one finds
ξ=

The range of ξ follows directly from requiring that Jα ∈ R. Note that Eq. (8) is a
dynamical equation of state, since the components of J in general change with time.
The lower bound (ξ = 2/3) is found for w = 0 and the upper bound (ξ = 2) is found
for v = 0. Note also that w = v gives ξ = 4/3, as in the case of electromagnetic
radiation.

4.1. Bianchi models and choice of frame
In dimension three there are nine different (classes of) Lie algebras – these are the
nine different Bianchi types I-IX. The line element of the Bianchi models can be
written as
1
ds2 = −dt2 + δab ω a ω b
where dω a = − γ abc ω b ∧ ω c − γ a0c dt ∧ ω c .
(10)
2
{ω a } is here a triad of 1-forms, and γ abc are the spatial structure coefficients of the
Lie algebra characterizing the corresponding Bianchi type. The tetrad {ω α } is dual
to the vector basis {eα }, which must satisfy the relation [eµ , eν ] = γ ρµν eρ . Refer to
([10], Chapter 15) for details. The time direction is chosen orthogonal to the orbits
of the isometry subgroup (i.e.: orthogonal to the three-dimensional hypersurfaces
of homogeneity), and the fundamental observer’s 4-velocity is aligned with this
∂
where t is the cosmological time. We also define
direction. It is given by u = ∂t
a dimensionless time quantity τ such that dt/dτ = 1/H, where H is the Hubble
parameter. The deceleration parameter q is now such that dH/dt = −(1 + q)H 2 .
A convenient frame in which to conduct the analysis is the orthonormal frame.
Such a frame will give first order evolution equations alongside a set of constraints
which are useful to simplify the analysis. The Bianchi space-times analyzed in the
present paper (I-VIIh ) admit an Abelian G2 subgroup. This allows for a 1 + 1 + 2
split of the four dimensional space-time. As will become clear later, this translates
into a 1 + 1 + 2 decomposition of the Einstein Field Equations, as well as the Jacobi
and the Bianchi identities. When the orthonormal frame approach is applied to G2
cosmologies, it is common to choose a group-invariant orbit-aligned frame, i.e. an
orthonormal frame which is invariant under the action of G2 [11].
5. No-hair theorems for the j-form
No-hair theorems that in previous literature has been established for the Bianchi
space-times in the presence of a cosmological constant and a perfect fluid are in this
section extended to the presence of the j-form in the equations. In particular, it is
found that the cosmic no-hair theorem [12] is valid also in this case a . Refer to [1]
for proofs.
Theorem 5.1 (First no-hair theorem). All Bianchi space-times I-VIIh with a
j-form, a non-phantom perfect fluid b and a positive cosmological constant will
be asymptotically de Sitter with ΩΛ = 1 in the case where γ > 0 (and similarly
ΩΛ + Ωpf = 1 in the case where γ = 0).
A similar but less general theorem holds also in the case of a perfect fluid with
0 ≤ γ < 2/3:
a Note that an anisotropic fluid may sustain an inflationary phase of expansion if it violates the
strong or dominant energy condition [ 13 ]. A j-form respects these energy conditions.
b A perfect fluid is said to be phantom if γ < 0.

Theorem 5.2 (Second no-hair theorem). All Bianchi space-times I-VIIh with
a j-form, a non-phantom perfect fluid Ωpf with equation of state parameter 0 ≤
γ < 2/3 will be asymptotically quasi de Sitter with q = 32 γ − 1 < 0.
6. New stable, anisotropic, self-similar space-times
We have also performed a dynamical systems analysis of certain Bianchi types with
a γ-law perfect fluid and a j-form fluid. Due to the no-hair theorems, we necessarily
remove the cosmological constant in the further study. Among extensions of known
self-similar space-times, we interestingly find three new anisotropic space-times;
Wonderland, The Edge and The Rope in Bianchi type I. Their global stability has
been determined by monotone functions. Extensions to these into other Bianchi
types are found, as summarized in the following.
Type I: Type I splits into two further invariant subspaces; a temporal and a
spatial part (as referred to the components of the j-form fluid). All of the three
new solutions presented below are in the subspace where the j-form fluid is purely
spatial.
Wonderland is an LRS solution containing both a non-rotating vector and the
perfect fluid. The field strength is aligned with the LRS axis and the expansion
asymmetry is of prolate type. Its range of existence is the open interval γ ∈ (2/3, 2).
It approaches the flat FLRW solution Ωpf when γ → 2/3 and the Kasner solution
(Σ+ = −1) when γ → 2. Interestingly, it has a deceleration parameter q = −1+3γ/2
identical to the flat FLRW solution. The line element of Wonderland is

(dy 2 + dz 2 ).

The Rope contains a rotating vector and the perfect fluid. Its range of existence is
the open interval γ ∈ (6/5, 4/3). It approaches Wonderland in the limit γ → 6/5 and
the Edge in the limit γ → 4/3. Like Wonderland, it has a deceleration parameter
q = −1 + 3γ/2 identical to the flat FLRW solution. The Rope is not an LRS
solution, although it is “almost LRS” close to Wonderland. The line element of the
Rope is

The Edge contains only a rotating vector and has deceleration parameter q = 1,

range of models, γ ∈ [0, 2]. The line element of the Edge is

Type V: In the type V subspace, we find a one-parameter extension of the Wonderland equilibrium set. Generally, in this one-parameter family, the j−form may have
both temporal and spatial components. We also find Plane Waves. For γ ∈ (2/3, 2)
these two are the only attractors.
Types II, IV, VI0 , VIh , VII0 and VIIh : In an upcoming paper (part of
Normann’s Ph.D. thesis, due in October), we intend to study at least the types
I,II,IV,VII0 and VIIh in depth. Here we only report a few preliminary results.
Wonderland. This solution (alongside one parameter extensions) are found in
the physical state space of the types II,IV VI0 , VIh , VII0 and VIIh . This is promising
in the sense that this solution might not be sensitive to choices of background
geometry. There remains, however, some work in order to pin down its stability.
Edge and Rope. These two solutions show up also in the physical state space of
type II.
Plane Waves. In type IV we find a two parameter extension of the plane wave
solution. In type VIIh , the plane waves is a three parameter family of solutions.
