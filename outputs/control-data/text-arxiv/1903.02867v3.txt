A consistent description of gauge theories on coordinate
dependent non-commutative (NC) space-time is a longstanding problem with a number of solutions, none of
which is free from criticism. In this work, we discuss
the approach proposed in [1], based on the conjecture
that any consistent gauge theory can be described in
terms of the L ∞ -structure. Starting with a well-defined

commutative gauge theory, we represent it, together with
the non-commutative deformation, as a part of a bigger

L ∞ -algebra by setting some initial brackets ℓ1 , ℓ2 , etc.
Then, solving the L ∞ -relations we determine the missing
brackets ℓn and close the L ∞ -algebra defining the NC
gauge theory which reproduces in the commutative limit

the original one. We provide the recurrence relations for
gauge
the construction of the pure gauge algebra L ∞ , using which we find an explicit form of the NC su(2)-like

and non-associative octonionic-like deformations of the
Abelian gauge transformations. The construction of the

L full
∞ -algebra describing the dynamics is discussed using

the example of the NC Chern–Simons theory. The obtained equations of motion are non-Lagrangian, which indicates the difference between our approach and the pre-

the covariant derivative of a scalar field Φ transforms like
the field Φ itself, (Da Φ)′ = e i f Da Φ. Having this, one may
proceed to construct the interacting Lagrangian between
the matter field and the gauge field as well as the Yang–
Mills Lagrangian describing the dynamics of the gauge
field A a .
The non-commutativity of space-time is a fundamental feature which can be justified by arguments from
string theory and quantum gravity, among others, see
[2, 3] for a review. It is introduced in the theory substituting the point-wise multiplication of functions by a star
product,
f ·g → f ⋆g = f ·g +

i ħ ab
Θ ∂a f ∂b g + · · · ,

where Θab is the anti-symmetric bi-vector field describing the non-commutativity. In the most simple and better understood case of the canonical non-commutativity,
the tensor Θab is constant. However in general the noncommutativity is a coordinate dependent field which in
some cases violates the Jacobi identity. The examples
are more realistic models coming from open [4–6, 1] and
closed [7,8] strings. For the non-constant Θab the Leibniz
rule involving the partial derivative ∂a and the star product ⋆ is violated, since

vious ones.

∂a ( f ⋆ g ) = ∂a f ⋆ g + f ⋆∂a g +

1 Introduction
Usually in the physics literature we understand a gauge
theory as a Lagrangian field theory invariant under a certain Lie group of local transformations. If one starts with
global, e.g., U (1)-transformations of a complex scalar
field, given by, Φ → Φ′ = e i f Φ, with a constant f and
tries to make it local admitting f to be a function of coordinate x, we observe that ∂a (e i f Φ) 6= e i f ∂a Φ. To fix it
we introduce a gauge covariant derivative, Da = ∂a + i A a ,
with A a being the gauge field with transformation law
A ′a = A a − ∂a f . Then from the Leibniz rule it follows that

Consequently the above described logic is no longer applicable, the naive substitution of the point-wise products with the star products in the Lagrangian breaks
gauge invariance of the theory.

V. G. Kupriyanov: L ∞ -Bootstrap Approach to Non-Commutative Gauge Theories

A possibility to overcome the problem with the violation of the Leibniz rule is to substitute the partial
derivative ∂a with the inner derivative, defined through
the star commutator, D a = c[x a , · ]⋆ . For the associative star product the Leibniz rule for D a follows from the
Jacobi identity, see [9–11] for details. The problem with
this method is the commutative limit when the star commutator vanishes. Another attempt consists in invoking
Hopf-algebra techniques and constructing the deformed
Leibniz rule with the help of a twist element [12–15]. Here
we should mention that the very few examples of the star
product originating from the twist are known, that is why
the applicability of this method is very restricted.
In this contribution to the proceedings of the Durham
Symposium on Higher Structures in M-theory we discuss a recently proposed method [1] which employs
L ∞ -algebras for the construction of the consistent noncommutative and non-associative deformations of gauge
theories. In Section 2 we give a brief introduction to L ∞ algebras and discuss its relation to gauge theories. In Section 3 we formulate the main ideas of the L ∞ -bootstrap
program and apply them to the construction of the pure
gauge
gauge algebra L ∞
describing the gauge variations of
fields, δ f A. The explicit examples of non-commutative
su(2)-like and non-associative octonionic-like deformations of the Abelian gauge transformations are obtained
in Section 4. In Section 5 we discuss the construction
of the algebra L full
∞ which governs the dynamics of the
gauge field. In particular we obtain the leading order corrections to the non-commutative Chern–Simons theory.
The conclusions and open problems are given in Section
6.

2 Gauge theories from L ∞ -algebras
We start this section with a formal definition of L ∞ algebras. In fact, they are generalized Lie algebras where
one has not only a two-bracket, the commutator, but
more general multilinear n-brackets with n inputs
ℓn :

defined on a graded vector space X = m X m , where
m ∈ , denotes the grading of the corresponding subspace. Each element x ∈ X , has its own degree, meaning
that if deg(x) = p, this element belongs to the subspace
X p . The concept of the degree is essential for the definition of the products ℓn . First, because these brackets are

graded anti-symmetric according to,
ℓn (. . . , x 1 , x 2 , . . . ) =
= (−1)1+deg(x1 )deg(x2 ) ℓn (. . . , x 2 , x 1 , . . . ) .

(4)

And second, because the result ℓn (x 1 , . . . , x n ) ∈ X p , with
n

p = deg ℓn (x 1 , . . . , x n ) = n − 2 +
deg(x i ) .

The set of higher brackets ℓn define an L ∞ -algebra, if
they satisfy the infinitely many relations

The permutations are restricted to the ones with
σ(1) < · · · < σ(i ),

σ(i + 1) < · · · < σ(n) ,

(7)

and the sign χ(σ; x) = ±1 can be read off from (4). The
first relations Jn with n = 1, 2, 3, . . . can be schematically
written as
J1 = ℓ1 ℓ1 ,
J2 = ℓ1 ℓ2 − ℓ2 ℓ1 ,

(8)

J3 = ℓ1 ℓ3 + ℓ2 ℓ2 + ℓ3 ℓ1 ,
J4 = ℓ1 ℓ4 − ℓ2 ℓ3 + ℓ3 ℓ2 − ℓ4 ℓ1 ,
from which one can deduce the scheme for the higher
Jn . More concretely, denoting (−1)xi = (−1)deg(xi ) , the
first L ∞ -relations read

The non-trivial L ∞ -relations are Jn+2 ( f , g , A n ) = 0 and
Jn+3 ( f , g , h, A n ) = 0 with Jn+2 ( f , g , A n ) ∈ X −1 and
Jn+3 ( f , g , h, A n ) ∈ X 0 .
The gauge variations are defined in terms of the brackets ℓn+1 ( f , A n ) ∈ X −1 as follows,

It was shown in [16–18], that the L ∞ -relations with two
gauge parameters, Jn+2 ( f , g , A n ) = 0, imply the off-shell
closure of the symmetry variations

First we choose only two non-trivial vector spaces as

ℓn (. . . , f , g , . . . ) = −ℓn (. . . , g , f , . . . ) ,
ℓn (. . . , f , A, . . . ) = −ℓn (. . . , A, f , . . . ) ,

The framework of L ∞ -algebras is quite flexible and
it has been suggested that every classical perturbative
gauge theory (derived from string theory), including its
dynamics, is organized by an underlying L ∞ -structure
gauge
[16]. For sure, the pure gauge algebra, called L ∞ , of
such theories satisfies the L ∞ -identities. To see this, let
us assume that the field theory has a standard type gauge
structure, meaning that the variations of the fields can be
organized unambiguously into a sum of terms, each of
which has a definite power in the fields.

where physically X 0 corresponds to the space of gauge
parameters or functions f , and X −1 contains the gauge
fields A a . Note that in this case ℓ1 ( f ) ∈ X −1 and can be
non-zero, while ℓ1 (A) ∈ X −2 , which is empty by now, i.e.,
ℓ1 (A) = 0, by construction. In this case, the only allowed
non-trivial higher bracket are the ones with one gauge
parameter ℓn+1 ( f , A n ) ∈ X −1 , and two gauge parameters
ℓn+2 ( f , g , A n ) ∈ X 0 . The graded symmetry in this case

Here we stress that the closure relation allows for a

are equivalent to the L ∞ -relations with three gauge parameters Jn+3 ( f , g , h, A n ) = 0. Thus, we see that the action of gauge symmetries on the fundamental fields is
gauge
governed by an L ∞ -algebra.
It is remarkable that the dynamics of the theory, i.e.
the equations of motion, are also expected to fit into an
extended L full
∞ -algebra. For this purpose one extends the
vector space to X 0 ⊕ X −1 ⊕ X −2

where X −2 also contains the equations of motion, i.e. F ∈

ℓn+2 ( f , E , A n ) ∈ X −2 , and ℓn+3 ( f , g , E , A n ) ∈ X −1 , can be
non-trivial and should satisfy the following identities

and

Jn+2 ( f , E , A n ) = 0 .

and means that the Jacobi identity for the ℓ2 bracket is
mildly violated by ℓ1 exact expressions. For the future
needs we will also write here the J4 relation,

Now the L ∞ -structure admits that the closure condition
(15a) is only satisfied on-shell, i.e. there can be terms
ℓn+3 ( f , g , F , A n ) ∈ X −1 on the right hand side. The gauge
variation of F reads

It was proposed that for writing down an action for
these equations of motion one needs an inner bracket

satisfying the cyclicity property
〈A 0 , ℓn (A 1 , . . . , A n )〉 = 〈A 1 , ℓn (A 0 , . . . , A n )〉

As a most simple example we discuss the U (1) gauge
symmetry. In this case the only non-vanishing bracket in
gauge
L ∞ -algebra is ℓ1 ( f ) = ∂a f . All L ∞ -relations are satisfied and according to (14) we have: δ f A a = ∂a f . Since
the gauge symmetry is Abelian the gauge closure condigauge
tion reads: [δ f , δg ]A = 0. In order to extend this L ∞ algebra to a corresponding L full
∞ one has to fix the bracket
ℓ1 : X −1 → X −2 , depending on the choice of the theory.
For the Chern–Simons theory we set: ℓ1 (A) = ǫc ab ∂a A b .
The first L ∞ -relation, ℓ1 (ℓ1 ( f )) = ǫc ab ∂a ∂b f , is trivially
satisfied. Since, all higher brackets are vanishing there
is no need to check the higher L ∞ -relations. The corresponding equations of motion are: Fc := ǫc ab ∂a A b = 0.
For the Maxwell theory, ℓ1 (A) = ✷ A a − ∂a (∂ · A), implying the equations of motion, Fa := ∂b (∂b A a − ∂a A b ) = 0.
The L ∞ -description of non-Abelian gauge theories can
be found in [16].

3 L ∞ -bootstrap
In the previous section we saw how L ∞ -structures give
rise to gauge theories. In principle, the corresponding
L ∞ -algebra may have an infinite number of brackets ℓn ,
which however, are not arbitrary, since they should satisfy the L ∞ -relations Jn = 0. The main idea of the L ∞ bootstrap approach consists in representing the original
undeformed gauge theory together with a deformation
as a part of a bigger L ∞ -structure by fixing initial brackets
ℓ1 , ℓ2 , etc. Then solving the L ∞ -relations Jn = 0, one determines the missing brackets ℓn , which are necessary to
close the algebra L new
∞ , corresponding to the consistent
deformation of the original theory.
To illustrate the above idea in this section we consider
the non-commutative deformation of Abelian gauge algauge
gebra L ∞ . In this case, as it was already discussed the
original undeformed theory is determined by setting the
bracket ℓ1 ( f ) = ∂a f . The non-commutative deformation
is introduced through the star commutator of functions
which, from the consideration of anti-symmetry, should
be assigned to the bracket ℓ2 ( f , g ) = i [ f , g ]⋆ . Just for
simplicity let us consider the limit of slowly varying, but
not necessarily small gauge fields, i.e., we discard the
higher derivatives terms in the star commutator and take
ℓ2 ( f , g ) = −{ f , g } as a (quasi)-Poisson bracket.
Having non-vanishing brackets ℓ1 ( f ) and ℓ2 ( f , g ),
one has to check the L ∞ -relation J2 ( f , g ) = 0, involving
yet undetermined bracket ℓ2 ( f , A). It means that now the
identity J2 ( f , g ) = 0 becomes an equation on ℓ2 ( f , A).
Solving this equation one may proceed to the next L ∞ relation, J3 ( f , g , h) = 0, and define the next bracket
ℓ3 ( f , g , A), etc. The procedure should be continued until
no new bracket can be determined and all L ∞ -relations
are satisfied. Let us see how it works in practice.
The relation J2 ( f , g ) = 0 reads

From which one finds
1
ℓ2 ( f , A) = −{ f , A a } − (∂a Θi j ) ∂i f A j .
2

(25)

Note that the solution is not unique, one may also set,
e.g.,
ij

ℓ′2 ( f , A) = ℓ2 ( f , A) + s a (x) ∂i f A j ,
ij

(26)

ji

with s a (x) = s a (x). By definition, ℓ′2 (A, f ) := −ℓ′2 ( f , A).
ij

The symmetry of s a (x) implies that this choice of the

the symmetric part
f A j can be always “gauged
away” by L ∞ -quasi-isomorphism, physically equivalent
to a Seiberg–Witten map [19], see [20] for more details.
Then we have to define the bracket ℓ3 ( f , g , A) from
the identity J3 ( f , g , h) = 0, which reads
0 = ℓ2 (ℓ2 ( f , g ), h) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (g , h), f ) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (h, f ), g )+
+ ℓ3 (ℓ1 ( f ), g , h) + ℓ3 ( f , ℓ1 (g ), h) + ℓ3 ( f , g , ℓ1 (h)) .

G( f , g , h) +G(h, f , g ) +G(g , h, f ) =
= ℓ2 (ℓ2 (ℓ1 (h), f ), g ) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 ( f , g ), ℓ1 (h))+
+ ℓ2 (ℓ2 (g , ℓ1 (h)), f ) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (ℓ1 (g ), h), f )+

The first line is a Jacobiator,
ℓ2 (ℓ2 ( f , g ), h) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (g , h), f ) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (h, f ), g ) =

The latter is nothing but the consistency condition for
(31).
It is remarkable that the consistency condition (33)
follows from the previously satisfied L ∞ -relations, namely
J2 ( f , g ) = 0, and J3 ( f , g , h) = 0. Indeed, taking the definition of G( f , g , h), one writes

(28)

For associative non-commutative deformations we may
just set ℓ3 (A, f , g ) = 0, while in the non-associative case
one needs non-vanishing ℓ3 (A, f , g ) to satisfy it. We set
1
ℓ3 (A, f , g ) = Πi j k A i ∂ j f ∂k g .
(29)
3
The next step is crucial for the whole construction. We
have to analyze the relation J3 ( f , g , A) = 0, given by
0 = ℓ2 (ℓ2 (A, f ), g ) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 ( f , g ), A) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (g , A), f )+

+ ℓ2 (ℓ2 (h, f ), ℓ1 (g )) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 ( f , ℓ1 (g )), h)+
+ ℓ2 (ℓ2 (ℓ1 ( f ), g ), h) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (g , h), ℓ1 ( f ))+
+ ℓ2 (ℓ2 (h, ℓ1 ( f )), g ) + ℓ1 (ℓ3 (ℓ1 ( f ), g , h))+
+ ℓ1 (ℓ3 ( f , ℓ1 (g ), h)) + ℓ1 (ℓ3 ( f , g , ℓ1 (h))) .

Using J2 ( f , g ) = 0, we may push ℓ1 out of the brackets
and rewrite it as
£
ℓ1 ℓ2 (ℓ2 ( f , g ), h) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (g , h), f ) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (h, f ), g )+
¤
+ ℓ3 (ℓ1 ( f ), g , h) + ℓ3 ( f , ℓ1 (g ), h) + ℓ3 ( f , g , ℓ1 (h))

(35)

+ ℓ1 (ℓ3 (A, f , g )) − ℓ3 (A, ℓ1 ( f ), g ) − ℓ3 (A, f , ℓ1 (g )) .
(30)
For simplicity, we replace it with J3 (g , h, ℓ1 ( f )) = 0, written in the form
ℓ3 (ℓ1 ( f ), ℓ1 (g ), h) − ℓ3 (ℓ1 ( f ), ℓ1 (h), g ) = G( f , g , h) ,
G( f , g , h) := ℓ1 (ℓ3 (ℓ1 ( f ), g , h))+
+ ℓ2 (ℓ2 (ℓ1 ( f ), g ), h) + ℓ2 (ℓ2 (g , h), ℓ1 ( f ))+
+ ℓ2 (ℓ2 (h, ℓ1 ( f )), g ) .
(31)
By construction, the above equation is antisymmetric
with respect to the permutation of g and h. The graded
symmetry of the ℓ3 bracket,
ℓ3 (ℓ1 ( f ), ℓ1 (g ), h) = ℓ3 (ℓ1 (g ), ℓ1 ( f ), h),

Which means that the consistency condition (33)
holds true as a consequence of the previously satisfied
L ∞ -relations. Taking into account (33) one may easily
check that the following expression (symmetrization in
f and g of the right-hand-side of the eq. (31)):

ℓ3 (ℓ1 ( f ), ℓ1 (g ), h) = − G( f , g , h) +G(g , f , h) ,

has the required graded symmetry and solves
J3 (g , h, ℓ1 ( f )) = 0. To the best of our knowledge for the
first time the solution of the algebraic equation of the
type (31) was proposed in [21].
Setting

ℓ3 (A, B, f ) = ℓ3 (ℓ1 ( f ), ℓ1 (g ), h)¯ℓ1 ( f )=A; ℓ1 (g )=B ,

3.1 Higher relations
Once the brackets ℓ3 ( f , g , A) and ℓ3 ( f , A, B ) are determined we may proceed to the next L ∞ -relation and
find the brackets with four entries, ℓ4 . First we analyze J4 ( f , g , h, A) = 0, which we rewrite in the form
J4 ( f , g , h, ℓ1 (k)) = 0. Taking onto account (11) we write
it explicitly as:
ℓ4 (ℓ1 ( f ), g , h, ℓ1 (k)) + ℓ4 ( f , ℓ1 (g ), h, ℓ1 (k)) +
+ ℓ4 ( f , g , ℓ1 (h), ℓ1 (k)) = F ( f , g , h, k) ,

¯
ℓ4 (A, g , h, B ) = ℓ4 (ℓ1 ( f ), g , h, ℓ1 (k))¯ℓ1 ( f )=A; ℓ1 (g )=B

Here we follow [22] for the solution of the algebraic equation (39a). By the construction F ( f , g , h, k) is antisymmetric in the first three arguments and the graded symmetry
of ℓ4 (ℓ1 ( f ), g , h, ℓ1 (k)) implies the graded cyclicity (consistency condition) for F ( f , g , h, k), which now reads:

+ F (h, k, f , g ) − F (g , h, k, f ) = 0 .

(42)

Again, the consistency condition (42) holds true as a
consequence of the previous L ∞ -relations, graded symmetry and multilinearity of the brackets ℓn . As previously

where

To compete the picture at this order let us also consider the L ∞ -relation: J4 ( f , g , A, B ) = 0, which we replace with J4 ( f , g , ℓ1 (h), ℓ1 (k)) = 0, and write in the form
of the equation:
ℓ4 (ℓ1 ( f ), g , ℓ1 (h), ℓ1 (k)) − ℓ4 ( f , ℓ1 (g ), ℓ1 (h), ℓ1 (k)) =

+ ℓ3 ( f , g , ℓ2 (h, ℓ1 (k))) .

− ℓ2 (ℓ3 ( f , g , ℓ1 (k)), ℓ1 (h))+

− ℓ3 ( f , ℓ2 (g , ℓ1 (k)), ℓ1 (h))+
+ ℓ3 (ℓ2 ( f , g ), ℓ1 (h), ℓ1 (k)) .
By construction, G( f , g , h, k) is antisymmetric in the first
two and symmetric in last two arguments, and as a consequence of the previous L ∞ -relations it satisfies the

G( f , g , h, k) +G(g , h, f , k) +G(h, f , g , k) = 0 .

(48)

Taking into account (48) one may check that the symmetrization in the last three arguments of the right-handside of the eq. (46),
ℓ4 ( f , ℓ1 (g ), ℓ1 (h), ℓ1 (k)) =

And finally we obtain the expression for ℓn+2 ( f , A
),
substituting in the above expression all ℓ1 ( f ) with the
corresponding fields A.
The identities with three gauge parameters
Jn+3 ( f , g , h, A n ) = 0 ,

n >1,

are substituted by the relations Jn+3 ( f , g , h, ℓ1 (k)n ) = 0,
written in the form:
ℓn+3 (ℓ1 ( f ), g , h, ℓ1 (k)n ) + ℓn+3 ( f , ℓ1 (g ), h, ℓ1 (k)n ) +

has the required graded symmetry and satisfies the equation in question.

3.2 Recurrence relations

+ ℓn+3 ( f , g , ℓ1 (h), ℓ1 (k)n ) = F ( f , g , h, k 1 , ..., k n ) .

(54)

The right-hand-side F ( f , g , h, k 1 , ..., k n ) is antisymmetric
in the first three arguments and symmetric in last n arguments, and it should also satisfy the graded cyclicity
relation,

For the higher relations, Jn+2 (g , h, A n ) = 0, we proceed
in a similar way. First we substitute them by the equations Jn+2 (g , h, ℓ1 ( f )n ) = 0, which can be represented in
the form

F ( f , g , h, k 1 , ..., k n ) − F (k 1 , f , g , h, k 2 , ..., k n ) +

ℓn+2 (ℓ1 ( f )n , ℓ1 (g ), h) − ℓn+2 (ℓ1 ( f )n , ℓ1 (h), g ) =

which as before follows from the previous L ∞ -relations,
graded symmetry and multi-linearity of the brackets ℓn .
The solution of (54) is constructed by taking the corresponding symmetrization of right-hand-side:

= G( f 1 , . . . , f n , g , h) ,

(50)

where the right hand side, G( f 1 , . . . , f n , g , h), is expressed
in terms of the previously defined brackets
ℓm+2 (ℓ1 ( f )m , ℓ1 (g ), h)

(51)

with m < n. It is symmetric in the first n arguments
and antisymmetric in the last two by construction. The
graded symmetry of ℓn+2 (ℓ1 ( f )n , ℓ1 (g ), h) implies the
consistency condition (since G( f 1 , . . . , f n , g , h) is symmetric in the first n arguments, one needs to check the cyclicity relation with respect to the permutation of the last
three slots),
G( f 1 , . . . , f n , g , h) +G( f 1 , . . . , f n−1 , g , h, f n ) +
+ G( f 1 , . . . , f n−1 , h, f n , g ) = 0 ,

(52)

which follows from the previous L ∞ -relations and can be
proved by induction.
Following [21] the solution of the equation (50) can be
constructed taking the symmetrization of the right-handside in the first n + 1 arguments, i.e.,

Our aim in this proceedings is to expose a more conceptual viewpoint on the L ∞ -bootstrap procedure. That
is why we omit here the technical details of the proof
that the graded cyclicity condition at each step follows
from the previously satisfied L ∞ -relations, leaving it for
the upcoming journal paper. However, to convince the
reader of the correctness of our results, we construct explicit examples of the non-trivial non-commutative and
non-associative deformations of the Abelian gauge algebra in the next section using the recurrence relations (53)
and (56).

the most simple situation taking the non-commutativity
parameter Θ to be a linear function of the coordinates.
We recall that we are working in the slowly varying
field limit, discarding the higher derivative terms in the
star commutator and replacing it by the (quasi)-Poisson
bracket. This is a “self-consistent” approximation of noncommutativity since the main algebraic properties of the
model are preserved. If we work with the NC deformations induced by an associative star product, the star
commutator satisfies the Jacobi identity, just as the corresponding Poisson bracket. In this case all higher brackets
with two gauge parameters vanish, so
[δ f , δg ]A = δ−i [ f ,g ]⋆ A .

(57)

For non-associative deformations induced by quasi-Poisson
structures the non-vanishing brackets of the type
ℓn+2 ( f , g , A n ) are required to compensate the violation
of the associativity.

4.1 NC su(2)-like deformation
As a first example we choose the non-commutativity parameter Θi j (x) = 2 εi j k x k , which correspond to the rotationally invariant 3D NC space [23–28]. For two dimensional NC models with rotational symmetry one may see,
e.g. [29]. The corresponding Poisson bracket is
{ f , g }ε = 2 εi j k x k ∂i f ∂ j g ,

(58)
n

implying that ℓn+2 ( f , g , A ) = 0, for n > 0. For the first
two brackets with one gauge parameter one finds,
ℓ2 ( f , A) = {A a , f }ε + εabc A b ∂c f ,
´
2³
ℓ3 ( f , A, A) = − ∂a f A 2 − ∂b f A b A a
3

(59)

with A 2 = A b A b . Then, using the recurrence relations (53)
we observe that the brackets ℓn+3 ( f , A n ) with the odd n
vanish, while for even n they have the structure
´
³
(60)
ℓn+3 ( f , A n ) = ∂a f A 2 − ∂b f A b A a χn (A 2 ) ,

for some monomial function χn (A 2 ). The combination of
(59) and (60) in (14) results in the following Ansatz for the
gauge variation:
δ f A a = ∂a f + {A a , f }ε + εabc A b ∂c f +
´

+ ∂a f A 2 − ∂b f A b A a χ(A 2 ) ,

where the function χ(A ) should be determined from the
closure condition,

Abelian gauge transformations in the slowly varying field
approximation. Following the lines described in [30] this
result can be generalized for non-commutative deformations along any linear Poisson structure Θi j (x).

4.2 Non-associative octonionic-like deformation
Now let us repeat the calculations with the quasi-Poisson
structure isomorphic to the algebra of the imaginary octonions,
{ f , g }η = 2 η I JK x K ∂I f ∂ J g ,

I , J , K = 1, . . . , 7 ,

(66)

where η I JK is a completely antisymmetric tensor of rank
three in seven dimensions with non-vanishing values
η I JK = +1

for

I J K = 123, 435, 471, 516, 572, 624, 673 .

(68)

where η I JLM is a completely antisymmetric tensor of
rank four in seven dimensions with non-vanishing values
η I JLM = +1

for

I J LM = 1267, 1346, 1425, 1537, 3247, 3256, 4567 .

(69)

The non-commutative deformations along this type of
quasi-Poisson structures are of special interest in connection to the non-geometric backgrounds in string and Mtheory [32, 33].
The expression for the non-associative octonioniclike deformation of the Abelian gauge transformations
for slowly varying fields reads
δ f A I = ∂I f + {A I , f }η + ηI JK A J ∂K f +

Note that a restriction of the quasi-Poisson structure
(66) to the three-dimensional space with coordinates x i ,
i = 1, 2, 3, results in the Poisson structure (58), isomorphic to the su(2) Lie algebra. Since in three dimensions
the totally antisymmetric tensor η I JK L of the rank four
automatically vanishes, the C bracket defined in (71) becomes just a su(2)-like Poisson structure, and the expression (70) transforms into (61).

5 L full
∞ and field dynamics
As it was already outlined in Section 2, the equations of
motion governing the dynamics of the theory also can be

(72)

ℓ2 ( f , g ) = −θ { f , g }ε ,
where we also inserted the small parameter θ in front
of the Poisson bracket for the discussion of the commutative limit in the end of this section. The brackets
ℓn+1 ( f , A n ) and ℓn+2 ( f , g , A n ) defining the pure gauge
gauge
algebra L ∞
were determined in Section 4.1. The rest
brackets ℓn (A n ), ℓn+2 ( f , E , A n ), and ℓn+3 ( f , g , E , A n ),
should be found from the identities (18).
The first non-trivial L ∞ -relation is
J2 ( f , A) :=

The difference to a previous example is that in this
case, ℓn+2 ( f , g , A n ) 6= 0, implying the modification of the
gauge closure condition. The commutator of two gauge
transformations is still a gauge transformation, however
with a field dependent gauge parameter, i.e., [δ f , δg ]A =
δ−C ( f ,g ,A) A , with
C ( f , g , A) = − { f , g }η −

extracted from the L ∞ -structure. To this end one needs
to construct an extended L full
∞ -algebra defined on the vector space X 0 ⊕ X −1 ⊕ X −2 , where now the subspace X −2
also contains the equations of motion. In this section we
discuss the construction of L full
∞ -algebra on the example
of NC Chern–Simons theory. Also we chose the NC su(2)like deformation and write the initial brackets as

:= ℓ1 (ℓ2 ( f , A)) − ℓ2 (ℓ1 ( f ), A) − ℓ2 ( f , ℓ1 (A)) = 0 ,

(73)

which we substitute as previously with
J2 ( f , ℓ1 (g )) :=
:= ℓ1 (ℓ2 ( f , ℓ1 (g ))) − ℓ2 (ℓ1 ( f ), ℓ1 (g )) = 0 .

(74)

Again, the graded symmetry of the ℓ2 bracket,
ℓ2 (ℓ1 ( f ), ℓ1 (g )) = ℓ2 (ℓ1 (g ), ℓ1 ( f )), implies a consistency
condition, which is satisfied trivially due to the previous
L ∞ -relation,
ℓ1 (ℓ2 ( f , ℓ1 (g ))) − ℓ1 (ℓ2 (g , ℓ1 ( f ))) =
= ℓ1 (ℓ1 (ℓ2 ( f , g )) − J2 ( f , g )) ≡ 0 .

(75)

One finds
¢
1 ¡
ℓ2 (ℓ1 ( f ), ℓ1 (g )) = ℓ1 ℓ2 ( f , ℓ1 (g )) + ℓ2 (g , ℓ1 ( f )) .
2

(76)

We stress however that contrary to Sections 3 and 4 and
because of the presence of non-empty vector space X −2
the above expression now does not fix yet the bracket
ℓ2 (A, B ), since it may contain the structures which will
vanish when one substitutes the vector fields by the gradient of function, A → ℓ1 ( f ). Let us discuss it in more details considering the example of CS theory.
In this case one calculates
ℓ2 (ℓ1 ( f ), ℓ1 (g )) = −θ ǫc ab {∂a f , ∂b g }ε −

with α and β being yet undetermined coefficients. From
(77) on finds that −β = α + 1/2, while the coefficient α
now can be determined from (73). To do it let us write
separately

(80)
From this we can see that taking α = −1, and ℓ2 ( f , E ) =
−θ { f , E }ε , one solves (73). The L ∞ -relations for ℓ2 for the
arguments (A A), ( f E ), (AE ) are trivially satisfied, as they
lie in trivial vector spaces X −3 and X −4 .
The bracket ℓ3 (E , f , g ) contributes to the L ∞ -relation
J3 ( f , g , A) = 0, which however is satisfied without it.
Therefore, we can set ℓ3 (E , f , g ) = 0. Next we consider
J3 (E , f , g ) = 0,
+ ℓ3 (E , ℓ1 ( f ), g ) + ℓ3 (E , f , ℓ1 (g )) .

(81)

The first line vanishes, since it is a Jacobiator. So we set
ℓ3 (E , A, f ) = 0. The L ∞ -relations, J4 (E , f , g , h) = 0, and
J4 (E , A, f , g ) = 0, see (11) for the explicit form, are satisfied automatically and we may set ℓ4 (E , A, B, f ) = 0.
The same can be shown for higher brackets of the form
ℓn+2 (E , A n , f ). Thus, we conclude that the gauge variation of the field equation (20) in case of the associative
deformation becomes
δ f F = ℓ2 ( f , F ) = θ {F , f }ε .

(82)

The missing brackets ℓn (A n ) should be determined
from the L ∞ -relations Jn ( f , A n−1 ) = 0. The next to leading order bracket ℓ3 (A, B,C ) was found in [1]. However

the explicit calculations are extremely tedious, so here
we provide only the resulting expression for the NC su(2)like deformation of the Abelian Chern–Simons equations
of motion up to order O (θ 3 ):

Let us emphasize that following the considerations of
Section 2, these equations are designed in a such a way
that (83) transforms covariantly under the NC su(2)-like
gauge transformation (61), i.e., up to order O (θ 3 ) the
equation (82) holds true, which also can be checked by
the explicit calculation. The correct commutative limit
here is evident.
An open question here is whether we can find an
explicit form of Fa . In Section 4.1, solving step by step
the L ∞ -relations we were able to conjecture the form of
the gauge transformation (61), then the conjecture was
checked and the undetermined function fixed from the
closure condition (62). Here we have quite a similar situation. Possibly solving the next L ∞ -relations
J4 (A, B,C , f ) = 0, J5 (A, B,C , D, f ) = 0, etc. one may conjecture the form of Fa with undetermined coefficient
functions. Then the coefficients can be fixed from the
equation (82).
Nevertheless we can make an important observation
regarding the properties of the obtained theory already
from the first orders contributions to the equations of
motion (83). At the end of Section 2, way how to write
down an action principle for the obtained from L ∞ approach equations of motion was described. To this end
one needs an inner product, 〈 , 〉 : X −1 ⊗ X −2 → , satisfying the cyclicity property. For the field theoretical models
on the NC su(2)-like space such a product coincides with
the canonical Weyl–Moyal case, see [30]:

We conclude that the equations of motion (83) are
non-Lagrangian. First of all this indicates the difference
between our approach and the previous ones mentioned
in the introduction which were searching the NC gauge
theories in the class of the Lagrangian systems. Second,
we need to understand the physics behind the theories we are interested in. The mathematical tools for
the investigation of properties and quantization of nonLagrangian gauge theories were discussed e.g., in [34, 35].

motion for non-commutative Chern–Simons theory described in Section 5 is left as an open problem.
Another open issue is the construction of the A ∞ structure reproducing our L ∞ -algebra after the graded
symmetrization. Some preliminary steps in this direction
were made in the appendix of [1]. This A ∞ -algebra can be
useful for the construction of the consistent interaction
with the matter fields.

Variation of the second term in this action over δA a reproduces the same structures as to first order in θ in the
equations of motion (83), however with coefficients different from (83) which are essential for the gauge covariance of the e.o.m. The situation with the third term in the
action (85) responsible for the second order in θ term in
the equations (83) is much more complicated. The contribution from terms like {A 2 , A a } or εabc A c ∂b (A 2 ) simply does not appear in the action, since A a {A 2 , A a } =
A a εabc A c ∂b (A 2 ) = 0. Consequently these terms cannot
be reproduced from the action (85).

6 Conclusions and outlook
References
The violation of the standard Leibniz rule on the coordinate dependent non-commutative spaces makes the
application of the gauge principle impossible. To solve
this problem we employ the L ∞ -framework to bootstrap
the non-commutative gauge theories. This framework
is quite flexible and allows one to account not only for
non-commutative but also for non-associative deformations of the gauge algebra.The violation of the Leibniz
rule is compensated by the presence of the higher brackets which make the gauge transformation non-linear in
the fields. The violation of the Jacobi identity for the star
commutator is compensated by other higher brackets
which enter the closure condition for the gauge algebra.
For non-associative deformation the commutator of two
gauge transformations is again a gauge transformation
however with a field dependent gauge parameter.
In this paper we derived the recurrence relations
gauge
for the construction of the pure gauge algebra L ∞
and used them to find an explicit form of the noncommutative su(2)-like and non-associative octonioniclike deformations of the Abelian gauge transformations.
The same logic in principle can be applied for the construction of the algebra L full
∞ describing the dynamics of
the system. However here we appoint the technical difficulty in the reconstruction of the bracket ℓn (A, B,C , . . . )
from the given ℓn (ℓ1 ( f ), B,C , . . . ), since the first one may
contain some structures which will vanish after substitu-
