Abstract
SN1991bg-like supernovae are a distinct subclass of thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia). Their spectral
and photometric peculiarities indicate their progenitors and explosion mechanism differ from ‘normal’
SNe Ia. One method of determining information about supernova progenitors we cannot directly observe
is to observe the stellar population adjacent to the apparent supernova explosion site to infer the
distribution of stellar population ages and metallicities. We obtain integral field observations and analyse
the spectra extracted from regions of projected radius ∼ kpc about the apparent SN explosion site
for 11 91bg-like SNe in both early- and late-type galaxies. We utilize full-spectrum spectral fitting to
determine the ages and metallicities of the stellar population within the aperture. We find that the
majority of the stellar populations that hosted 91bg-like supernovae have little recent star formation.
The ages of the stellar populations suggest that that 91bg-like SN progenitors explode after delay times
of > 6 Gyr, much longer than the typical delay time of normal SNe Ia, which peaks at ∼ 1 Gyr.

1 INTRODUCTION

and photometrically peculiar subclasses of these events.
The discovery of SN1991bg in particular (Filippenko
et al., 1992) - the prototype event for the SN1991bg-like
subclass of SNe Ia (hereafter 91bg-like SNe, see Taubenberger (2017) for a review) - challenged the accepted
paradigm that SNe Ia are a homogeneous class of events.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are usually described as
a photometrically and spectroscopically homogeneous
class of astrophysical transients. They are thought to
arise from the thermonuclear disruption of a carbonoxygen (CO) white dwarf star in an interacting binary
system (see Hillebrandt et al. (2013); Maguire (2017) for
a review). ‘Normal’ SNe Ia are standardizable candles
(Branch & Tammann, 1992): there is a tight relation
between their peak luminosity and the width of their
light curve (the Phillips (1993) relation), and between
their peak luminosity and their optical color at peak
luminosity (Tripp, 1998). Thus they make an excellent
tool for measuring cosmological distances. As standardizable candles, normal SNe Ia have been employed in
cosmology to probe the geometry of the universe (Riess
et al., 1998; Perlmutter et al., 1999; Leibundgut, 2001).
However, the proliferation of SN surveys over the past 30
years has led to the discovery of several spectroscopically
∗ E-mail:

91bg-like SNe events share several key features with
their normal SNe Ia cousins, and are clearly thermonuclear supernovae. Specifically, they lack any indication of
hydrogen and helium in their spectra while also exhibiting strong Si II in absorption (Filippenko, 1997). Moreover, absorption features in their spectra near maximum
light indicate the presence of a number of intermediate
mass elements (IMEs) including silicon, magnesium, calcium, sulphur and oxygen. The presence of these IMEs
is consistent with these events belonging to the class of
thermonuclear transients (Filippenko, 1997). However,
91bg-like SNe also exhibit significant photometric and
spectroscopic peculiarities compared to normal SNe Ia.

This is highly suggestive of a different explosion mechanism and/or progenitor configuration. The subclass
differs from ‘normal’ SNe Ia in the following ways:
• 91bg-like SNe are subluminous compared to SNe
Ia by 1.5 − 2.5 mag at optical maximum, reaching
peak absolute magnitudes of only −16.5 to −17.7
in B (Taubenberger, 2017),
• 91bg-like SNe are significanly redder than their
normal SNe Ia cousins, with (B − V )max = 0.5 − 0.6
mag,
• 91bg-like SNe light curves decline very quickly, and
are characterized by a lightcurve decline parameter
1.8 ≤ ∆m15 (B) ≤ 2.1, compared to ∆m15 (B) ≤ 1.7
for normal SNe Ia. 91bg-like SNe also have a light
curve rise time of ∼ 13 − 15 days (Taubenberger
et al., 2008), a few days shorter than normal SNe
Ia. Combined with their low peak luminosities, this
is consistent with these events synthesising significanlty lower 56 Ni masses than their normal SNe
Ia counterparts (∼ 0.05 − 0.1 M , Sullivan et al.
(2011)).
• 91bg-like SNe lack a secondary maximum in the
near infrared (NIR), unlike normal SNe Ia, likely
due to the 91bg-like SNe ejecta being cooler and less
luminous than that of the normal SNe Ia. Instead,
they exhibit a single NIR maximum delayed a few
days with respect to the maximum in B (Garnavich
et al., 2004), whereas the first NIR peak in a normal
SN Ia lightcurve preceeds the B band maximim. The
absence of the secondary NIR maximuim makes it
impossible to perform a simple time-shift to make
the 91bg-like SNe lightcurve map to the standardizable lightcurve of the normal Ia, and the absence
of the feature is physically interpreted as a merging
of the primary and secondary NIR maxima into a
single maximum due to the physical conditions in
the SN ejecta (Kasen, 2006; Blondin et al., 2015).
• Spectroscopically, 91bg-like SNe exhibit similar premaximum optical spectra to normal SNe Ia - i.e.
dominated by IMEs. However a transition to a spectrum dominated by iron group elements happens
earlier in 91bg-like SNe than in normal SNe Ia
(Taubenberger, 2017).
• Particularly notable is the presence of unusually
strong Ti II, and O Iλ7774 in absorption in the
post-maximum spectra. A number of these spectral peculiarities can be attributed to the unusually
cool and slow-moving ejecta (∼ 7000 km/s, Taubenberger et al., 2008) when 91bg-like SNe are compared to normal SNe Ia: the lower ionization state
favours a higher abundance of neutral and singly
ionized species. However, it is considered unlikely
that ionization state and temperature explains all
these spectral peculiarities.
To explain the spectroscopic and photometric peculiari-

ties of 91bg-like SNe, a variety of progenitors and explosion mechanisms have been suggested. A ‘violent merger’
of two near-equal mass CO WDs was explored via hydrodynamical simulations in Pakmor et al. (2010). Although
the lightcurves of the these explosions were somewhat
too broad to reproduce observations of 91bg-like SNe,
the synthesised spectra, red colour and low expansion velocities were a fairly good match to observed properties
of 91bg-like SNe. To better reproduce the characteristics
of 91bg-like SNe light curves, it was suggested by Pakmor
et al. (2013) that the faint, fast lightcurves of 91bg-like
SNe could result from the merger of a CO WD and a
helium WD (e.g. see their figure 4). The smaller ejecta
mass that is expected in such an explosion can naturally
explain the observed narrower lightcurves of 91bg-like
SNe compared to their ‘normal’, brighter counterparts.
A specific formation channel of the same progenitor scenario (CO WD + He WD merger) was found by Crocker
et al. (2017) to plausibly supply the high 44 Ti yield that
is necessary for these merging events to also explain the
positron annihilation signal in the Milky Way.
While a number of progenitor configurations and explosion mechanisms have been suggested to explain the
properties of 91bg-like SNe, no direct observations of the
progenitor systems have been made, and so the exact
progenitors of these SNe remain unknown. One method
of inferring information about the progenitors of SNe
independent of the observed properties of the explosion
is to consider the galaxies in which they occur. A qualitative connection between host galaxy properties and
the occurrence of 91bg-like SNe has already been well
established. In LOSS (the Lick Observatory Supernova
Search, Li et al. (2011)), around 15 per cent of all SNe
Ia were of the 91bg-like SNe subclass. However, considering only early type galaxies, the fraction of SNe Ia
that are of the 91bg-like SNe subtype rises to 30 per
cent. Furthermore, in Perets et al. (2010) the cumulative distribution of 91bg-like SNe occuring in galaxies
of different Hubble types was found to be different to
that of SNe Ia. While SNe Ia are observed to occur in
all galaxy types, from passive to star forming, 91bg-like
SNe occur predominantly in early type galaxies. While
this is clear, a specific connection between the properties
of early type galaxies (which tend to be more massive,
more metal-rich, host significantly less star formation,
and contain older stellar populations) and 91bg-like SNe
is yet to be firmly established.
A number of works (Gallagher et al., 2008; Stanishev
et al., 2012; Rigault et al., 2013; Galbany et al., 2014;
Rigault et al., 2018) have now investigated the connection between the global properties of galaxies and the
observed stretch and colour of SNe Ia, as this may be a
source of bias in cosmology. While the focus has been
on ‘normal’ SNe Ia, Gallagher et al. (2008) noted a
correlation between older stellar populations and lower
luminosity SNe Ia. Several of their low luminosity super-

91bg-like SNe host galaxies
novae were classified spectroscopically as SNe 91bg in
the Berkeley Supernova Project (Silverman et al., 2012),
and their host galaxies were found to contain stars with
an average age of ∼ 10 Gyr.
The observations of Gallagher et al. (2008) were restricted to early-type galaxies and utilized slit spectroscopy. Consequently, the ages and metallicties of the
stellar populations derived represent a single global average for these SNe host galaxies. Since these host galaxies
are early-type galaxies where the stellar populations will
be well-mixed, the global galaxy properties are a good
approximation for the stellar population that gives rise
to the supernova progenitor (Galbany et al., 2014). However, the method employed by Gallagher et al. (2008)
makes it hard to exclude the presence of recent local star
formation within a few kpc of the supernova progenitor.
Furthermore, the Gallagher et al. (2008) work makes use
of the Lick/IDS Index system (Worthey, 1994; Worthey
& Ottaviani, 1997) to derive the average age and metallicity of the stellar populations of the observed galaxies,
and does not take into account that stellar population
will be composed of stars that formed at different times
and thus cannot be characterized by a single stellar age.
Global galaxy properties may help with the standardization of supernova lightcurves, however to determine
whether a supernova subtype is associated with an old
(> 2 − 3 Gyr old) stellar population requires one to rule
out the presence of recent star formation within a few
kpc of the apparent supernova explosion site.
To do this, it is necessary to consider a spectrum of the
stellar population adjaced to the apparent supernova
explosion site. Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations
can be utilized to investigate this. For nearby supernova
hosts (up to z ∼ 0.03), an aperture with a radius of
∼ 1.5” can resolve a region around 1 kpc in projected
radius on the galaxy. Furthermore, a local measurement
can also be used to determine the distribution of stellar
population ages using a method such as penalized pixel
fitting of the stellar spectrum extracted from the same
apeture used in step one (Cappellari & Emsellem, 2004;
Cappellari, 2017).
In this work, we will utilize penalized pixel fitting to
investigate the age distribution of the stellar populations
that hosted 91bg-like supernovae in a range of galaxies
of all morphophological types. We choose to use the
local stellar spectra at the supernova explosion site as
opposed to integrated galaxy spectra. For example, in
the case of a late-type host galaxy, star formation may
be localized to the disk of a galaxy. In an integrated spectrum of the galaxy, this star formation can dominate the
observed light due to the luminosity of O-A stars. Thus,
if a supernova occurs in the bulge of a spiral galaxy,
one is likely to underestimate the age of the population
that gave rise to the SN progenitor of only global host
galaxy properties are considered. On the other hand, if
a SN occurs in an early-type galaxy where significant

3
stellar migration may have occured, one can still use
the IFU technique to constrain the age of the supernova
progenitor: if a SN progenitor is formed within the last
Gyr, evidence of this star formation will still be apparent
in the stellar spectra as stars will not migrate far from
their birthplaces in this timeframe (Fujii & Baba, 2012).
Furthermore, the local stellar population will have a
distribution of ages representative of that of the whole
galaxy (Galbany et al., 2014).
Several works have utilized a similar method, employing IFU spectroscopy to investigate the region in the
immediate projected vicinity of SNe Ia to determine the
relationship between the scatter in SNe Ia properties
after standardization, and star formation rate (Stanishev
et al., 2012; Rigault et al., 2013, 2018). Those works are
particularly important in the context of cosmology, as
the dispersion in Hubble residuals can affect the precision and accuracy of measurement of the cosmological
parameters, such as the Hubble constant and the dark
energy equation of state parameter. However, the properties of stellar populations at the explosion sites of
different subtypes of SNe Ia have not yet been studied
in detail. 91bg-like SNe are a distinct subclass which are
empirically shown to occur predominantly in old stellar
populations. Thus, they provide a perfect opportunity
to use IFU spectroscopy to quantify the age of stellar
populations close to the SN explosion site and constrain
the presence of recent star formation.
In this paper, we present the results of our observations of 91bg-like SNe host galaxies using IFU spectroscopy based on data obtained at Siding Spring Observatory. We derive the distribution of stellar population
ages and metallicities of the stars in a region of radius
∼ 1 kpc around the apparent SN explosion site using
full-spectrum fitting. Our observations and data reduction are described in section 2, and the results of the
full-spectrum fitting procedure is described in section 3.
Finally, we present a discussion of our results in section
4 and our conclusions in section 5.

2.1 Sample selection
Our sample of 91bg-like SNe host galaxies is composed
of 15 hosts of SNe spectroscopically identified as 91bglike SNe by Silverman et al. (2012) visible from Siding
Spring Observatory, as well as the host of SN2012fx
(Pastorello et al., 2012) and the host of lsq15bb (Fremling
et al., 2015). We do not make any selection cuts based
on galaxy morphology, luminosity or mass. Nor do we
make a selection cut against supernovae that have large
offsets from their host as there may be a diffuse stellar
population present at the explosion site not obvious in

2.2 Observations
We obtained integral field observations of 17 spectroscopically identified 91bg-like SNe host stellar populations
using the WiFeS instrument (Dopita et al., 2007) on the
Australian National University 2.3m Advanced Technology Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO).
Observations were obtained over a total of 14 nights
between July 2016 and February 2017. WiFeS is a widefield Integral Field Unit with a total field of view of
25” × 38”. The instrument configuration is shown in
Table 2. The aperture of WiFeS is centered on the apparent location of each SN, with the position angle of
the aperture chosen to minimize contamination from
nearby stars but, as we only extract spectra from pixels
close to the apparent SN location, the position angle
has little practical importance.
Exposure times reflect changes in our observation strategy to account for inclement weather conditions. A summary of all our science observations is given in Table 1.
Bias frames, Cu-Ar arcs and dome flats were obtained at
1 http://archive.eso.org/dss/dss

the beginning and end of the night. Wire frames2 were
obtained at the end of each night, and sky flats were obtained at the beginning of each night. For each individual
galaxy observation, Cu-Ar arcs (required for accurate
wavelength solution, which may drift a few Angstrom
over the course of a night) and bias frames are obtained
within 30 minutes of the observation, and each galaxy
observation is accompanied by at least one sky frame,
which is used to remove skyline contamination. Finally,
a spectrophotometric standard star is observed on each
night of observation. Where weather conditions did not
permit time for these observations, spectrophotometric
calibration was carried out using a spectrophotometric
standard taken in earlier runs, with the standard frames
being taken in similar photometric weather conditions
and at similar airmass to the galaxy being observed.

2.3 Data Reduction
Data reduction was facilitated by the PyWiFeS data
reduction package (Childress et al. (2014a)). The
pipeline produces a spectrophotometrically calibrated
and fully coadded datacube, and a corresponding
parallel-processed error cube. At this point, a number
2 A wire frame ensures the spectrograph slits are appropriately
aligned on the CCD

of SN hosts are removed from the sample due to the
observations having either been undertaken in inclement
weather (footnote 4 of 1), or of a SN explosion site with
a large offset from the SN host galaxy, thus the SNR in
the datacube is inadequate to obtain either a local or
global stellar spectrum associated with the SN host
Spectra of the stellar populations local to each SN were
then extracted from the calibrated datacube. We use
a seeing-limited aperture of 3” × 3” centered on the
apparent location of the SN in each host galaxy (the
physical size of these apertures varies with redshift and
is shown in Table 1). These spectra are processed to
remove residual sky lines using a nearby area free from
galaxy light, offset from the host galaxy from the same
final datacube, and the mean resulting spectrum is extracted from the 3” × 3” region of interest.
Each remaining spectrum is then shifted to rest-frame
wavelength according to the host redshift listed on
NED3 , which is checked against the redshift we derive
from either the narrow Hα line if present, or the H
and K lines for the remaining galaxies. The spectra
are then corrected for Milky Way dust reddening using brutus 0.3.14 . Galactic extinction is derived using
NASA Extragalactic Database (NED) from the Schlafly
& Finkbeiner (2011) recalibration of Schlegel et al. (1998)
infrared based dust map. The map is based on dust emission from COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA; the recalibration assumes a Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law with
Rv = 3.1 and different source spectrum than Schlegel
et al. (1998). The resulting spectra are subsequently
ready for analysis.
3 RESULTS
3.1 Full Spectrum Fitting
Deriving stellar population ages requires simultaneous
determination of both the age of stars and their metallicity as there is a significant degeneracy between the
effect of metallicity and age on galaxy spectra (Worthey,
1994).
We use the publicly available penalized pixel fitting
code (pPXF, Cappellari & Emsellem (2004); Cappel3 https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/ The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic
Database (NED) is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

lari (2017)) to fit linear combinations of simple stellar populations (SSPs) from the MILES stellar library
(Sánchez-Blázquez et al., 2006; Vazdekis et al., 2010),
which provides 985 stellar spectra across a wavelength
range of 3525 − 7500 Å at 2.5 Å spectral resolution, for
stellar metallicities ranging from [M/H] = 0.22 to
[M/H] = −2.3. The ‘solution’ of the problem - to fit
multiple SSPs to an observed spectrum - is defined by
different weights applied to each SSP in a regular grid
in log-age and metallicity space. The program outputs
a weighted average age of the stellar population and a
weighted average metallicity according to these weights,
along with information about the weights applied to each
age-metallicity bin. This allows us to determine both the
distribution of stellar population ages that contribute
to the spectrum, and the weighted average age of the
stellar population, as well as whether any substantially
younger or older stellar population than the average is
present.
We obtain a fit to the total spectrum of 11 91bg-like
SN host galaxies (with flux normalized by the flux at
5500 Å). pPXF decomposes the spectra into nebular and
stellar components, and determines the mass fraction
of stars into age and metallicity bins determined by the
available grid of SSP models.
In Fig. 1 we show outputs from pPXF which display the
mass fraction of stars in age and metallicity bins. The
majority of stellar populations we observe exhibit similar
characteristics to Fig. 1(b), including the local stellar
population of SN2012fx, which occured in the bulge of a
late-type galaxy. These stellar populations have a large
mass fraction of stars at ages ∼ 10 Gyr at super-solar
metallicities ([M/H] > 0). The weighted average stellar
population properties of seven of our observed SN explosion sites suggest that 91bg-like SNe occur preferentially
in stellar populations with ages ∼ 10 Gyr with solar, or
slightly sub-solar metallicities (Fig 3).
Three of the observed stellar populations, however, contain a younger stellar component: the host of SN1993aa
(Fig 1(a)), the host of SN2008bt (Fig 1(c)) and the host
of SN2008ca (Fig 1(d)). The spectra of these galaxies
are also unusual in comparison to the majority of the
galaxies observed. An example of a typical spectrum
we analyse with pPXF is shown in Fig. 2(a). This spectrum corresponds to the population shown in Fig 1(b),
and is composed predominantly of old, metal rich stars.
In comparison, the spectrum of the host population of
SN1993aa (Fig 2(b)) is significantly bluer and exhibits
strong emission lines of Hα , [N II], [S II], [O III] and Hβ .
The strong emission lines indicate there may be ongoing star formation in this stellar population, in good
agreement with the high mass fraction of stars with
ages ∼ 1 Gyr seen in Fig 1(a). Similarly, the host population of SN2008ca also exhibits strong emission lines
(Fig 2(d)), however the spectrum is (within the noise)
somewhat less blue than that of SN1993aa, suggesting

(d) Stellar pop. within 3.44 kpc of SN2008ca

Figure 1. Mass fraction of stars in different age and metallicity bins based on spectra extracted from 3"x3" regions centered on the SN
explosion site in each galaxy, which are interpreted as representing the distribution of stellar population ages which give rise to the SN
progenitor. The radius of the aperture in physical units is shown in each subcaption. The population shown in (b) is representative of
the remaining seven galaxies for which the stellar populations are fitted with pPXF.

91bg-like SNe host galaxies
an older stellar component may also be present (Fig
1(d)). While the physical area of the aperture within
the host of SN1993aa encompasses ∼ 1 kpc, it should be
noted that the host of SN2008ca is significantly more
distant than that of SN1993aa and therefore the entire galaxy, with an area of ∼ 50 kpc is sampled in the
aperture. This may be the reason we observe apparent
multiple stellar populations in this SN host galaxy. An
example of a more resolved galaxy that also exhibits
multiple stellar populations is the host of SN2008bt.
This galaxy has strong Hα , [N II] and [S II] emission
(fig 2(c)), and while it has a predominantly old stellar
population, there is a small mass fraction of stars which
have an age of ∼ 0.5 Gyr (fig 1(c)). When we consider
the position of the aperture on the host galaxy, we see
that while the SN has occurred in a position that may
be coincident with the bulge of the galaxy, because the
galaxy is viewed almost edge on, there may be some
contamination of starlight and nebular emission from
a younger, star-forming disk. While we cannot rule out
that the supernova occurred in this region, we do find
that the majority of the stellar mass within the aperture
is concentrated in the old, metal rich stellar population.

3.3 Stellar populations hosting SNe 91bg
As a further comparison, we overplot the stellar
population ages and metallicities determined using slit
spectroscopy for early type galaxies hosting SNe 91bg
from Gallagher et al. (2008). The black markers in
Figure 3 show the ages and metallicities of these galaxies.
These ages and metallicities are determined using Lick
indicies (Worthey, 1994; Worthey & Ottaviani, 1997)
which relies on comparing the measured equivalent
width of different absorption lines found in galaxy spectra to an irregular diagnostic grid computed from simple
stellar populations. As these galaxies were observed
using slit spectroscopy, the stellar populations are
representative of the average age of the stars contained
in the whole galaxy. Compared to the SNe Ia comparison
sample taken from Maoz et al. (2012), the galaxies that
host SNe 91bg in Gallagher et al. (2008) appear to
contain older stellar populations. Furthermore, the ages
and metallicities derived for these galaxies are consistent
with the ages and metalliticies of the local stellar
populations of SNe 91bg we derive from our observations.

4 DISCUSSION
3.2 Comparison sample of SNe Ia
While we wish to quantify the ages and metallicities of
the stellar populations that host 91bg-like SNe, we also
wish to compare the distribution of stellar population
ages and metallicities to a sample of SNe Ia host galaxies to investigate whether 91bg-like SNe differ in some
way. Unfortunately, a representative sample of SNe Ia
host galaxies with spectra of the stellar population in
the immediate vicinity of the apparent SN location is
not publicly available. However, in Maoz et al. (2012) a
sample of SDSS galaxies that hosted SNe Ia is compiled.
As a comparison sample, we compute the weighted average stellar population age and metallicity for these
galaxies using pPXF. We note that this average is for
the integrated light of the host galaxy where the SDSS
fiber is centered on the core of the galaxy, and not solely
the stellar population ∼ 1 kpc from the apparent supernova location, however it has been previously noted that
the global properties of SNe Ia host galaxies correlate
well with the properties local to the SN explosion site
(Galbany et al., 2014).
We find that the weighted average ages of stellar populations have a wide, almost uniform distribution, with
ages between ∼ 30 Myr and > 10 Gyr. The metallicity
distribution is peaked toward super-solar metallicities
([M/H] > 0). We also find that the older the stellar population of the galaxy, the more metal-poor the weighted
average metallicity becomes.

In this work we analyzed the spectra of galaxies observed with the WiFeS IFU. This allowed us to isolate
the stellar population within a few kiloparsecs of the
apparent SN explosion site, and determine the age and
metallicity of the stellar population in the vicinity of
the SN. The age of the stellar population surrounding
the SN explosion site in particular may constrain the
delay time distribution of 91bg-like SNe (the distribution
of times between the SN progenitor formation and the
subsequent SN explosion).
In particular, we find that the stellar populations that
host SNe 91bg have greater weighted average stellar
population ages than those of SNe Ia and many lack
evidence of recent star formation. This is strong evidence
that 91bg-like SNe are not associated with recent star
formation (within the last ∼ 1 Gyr, as the stellar spectra lack evidence of a significant number of O-A stars
being present. Furthermore, these results suggest that
the delay time distribution of 91bg-like SNe is peaked
toward very long delay times (10 Gyr), in contrast with
SNe Ia, whose delay times peak at ∼ 1 Gyr (Childress
et al., 2014b). We compared our derived average stellar
population ages and metallicities for the local stellar
populations of SNe 91bg with the stellar population
ages and metallicities of SNe 91bg host galaxies found
by Gallagher et al. (2008) and find a good agreement
within the error bars between the two results.
We note, however, the large errors on the metallicity
of the stellar populations in both our own measurements and those from Gallagher et al. (2008). While

Figure 3. Weighted average stellar population ages for SDSS spectra of galaxies that hosted SNe Ia, based on the sample presented in
Maoz et al. 2012 (blue) and for the local stellar populations of SNe 91bg galaxies (red). Error bars show the 16th and 84th percentile of
the distrubution of stellar population ages and metallicities based on the CDF of stellar population properties. Black points show the
ages and metallicities of SNe 91bg host galaxies observed in Gallagher et al. 2008, derived using Lick/IDS indicies and their respective
errors. The histograms show the distribution of weighted average stellar population ages (bottom) and metallicities (right). The binning
reflects the available metallicities and ages of the stellar population templates in the MILES library used to fit the spectra.

10
two different methods are used to determine the stellar
population parameters - full spectrum fitting with pPXF
in this work and the Lick/IDS index system in Gallagher
et al. (2008) - the stellar model library used to compute
stellar population ages and metallicities is identical (the
MILES library Vazdekis et al., 2010). While these stellar templates are well sampled in the age parameter
space, there are only seven available metallicities between [M/H] = −2.3 and [M/H] = 0.2. Although the
metallicity computed by full spectrum fitting is accurate,
it lacks the precision that would be possible with a finer
grid of models in metallicity space. This is reflected by
the error bars shown in Fig 3.
The SNe 91bg host galaxies from Gallagher et al. (2008)
are part of a larger sample of massive elliptical galaxies that hosted thermonuclear supernovae. As massive
elliptical galaxies typically contain older stellar populations, there is likely a bias toward sampling host stellar
populations where we expect the relative rate of SNe
91bg to normal SNe Ia to be somewhat higher than
average. In our sample, we make no selection cuts and
select galaxies of any morphological classification that
hosted SNe 91bg. The majority of the host galaxies we
observe are selected from the BSNIP sample (Silverman
et al., 2012). These supernovae were observed as part of
a targeted, local survey. Consequently, the galaxies in
which SNe in a targeted survey occur tend to be more
massive, and SNe that occur in less massive galaxies
may be missed. As a result, there may be some bias
toward sampling older stellar populations, since more
massive galaxies tend to contain older, more metal-rich
stars. However, we have also observed SNe 91bg hosts
that were not targeted by BSNIP and in which 91bglike SN occured more recently, in particular the host of
SN2012fx, a nearby spiral galaxy for which the apparent
SN explosion site is in the galactic bulge. The stellar
population local to the SN explosion site is found to be
relatively typical of those found in the BSNIP sample
and has a weighted average stellar population age of
∼ 10 Gyr.
We also compare our stellar population average ages and
metallicities with those derived for the host galaxies of
SNe Ia as observed by SDSS, based on a sample from
Maoz et al. (2012). There may be some bias associated
with our measurement of stellar population ages for these
SNe Ia host galaxies as the SDSS fiber is placed over
the center of the galaxies they observe. This means that
one is likely to observe most of the integrated light from
the central, bulge regions of these galaxies, biasing our
results to older ages as the star-forming, younger outer
regions of some galaxies observed by SDSS are missed
by the fiber. Consequently the weighted average plotted
in figure 3 may not represent the exact properties of
the stellar population close to the explosion site and
therefore may represent an upper limit on the stellar
population age.

F. H. Panther et al.
We find that SNe Ia are hosted by galaxies that exhibit a
broad range of weighted average stellar population ages,
from the very young at 30 Myr to the very old (∼ 10 Gyr).
This is in contrast to the stellar populations that host
SNe 91bg, which cluster at the substantially older end
of this distribution. This demonstrates that SNe 91bg
may be associated with progenitors that tend to occur
at longer delay times than SNe Ia (e.g. as suggested in
Crocker et al. (2017)). We find that while around half
of our observed galaxies have Hα emission and nebular
emission indicating recent star-formation activity, the
majority of galaxies are dominated by absorption lines
and have no strong emission lines. Moreover, with the
exception of the host of SN1993aa, the regions of the
galaxies that hosted 91bg-like SNe that exhibit emission
lines are also found to contain older, ∼ 10 Gyr stellar
populations.
Note that while we find that 91bg-like SNe are associated with older populations than SNe Ia, this result
does not preclude that the same galaxy could host both
types of supernovae. Indeed, two examples of galaxies
hosting both supernovae are SN1991bg and SN1957B (a
SN Ia), which both occurred in M84, and of the 91bg-like
supernova SN2006mr in Fornax A ((Maoz & Mannucci,
2008), which also hosted five SNe Ia. The point here is
that while the delay time distribution of SNe Ia may
peak at 1 Gyr (Childress et al., 2014b), SNe Ia can still
occur in stellar populations with much greater ages (see
Fig 3). Moreover, both M84 and Fornax A are earlytype galaxies, and will likely be dominated (in terms of
number) by an old stellar population from which the
91bg-like supernova progenitors may arise but they may
also contain younger populations that could host SNIa
progenitors. It is important to note that while we find
that 91bg-like SNe are associated with older populations
than SNe Ia, our results are not contradicted by these
observations. Our comparison sample of SNe Ia from
Maoz et al. (2012) shows evidence that while the delay
time distribution of SNe Ia may peak at 1 Gyr (Childress
et al., 2014b), SNe Ia can still occur in stellar populations with much greater ages (see Fig 3). Moreover, M84
and Fornax A are early-type galaxies, and will likely be
dominated by an old stellar population from which the
91bg-like supernova progenitors may arise. Thus it is
possible for SNe Ia and 91bg-like supernovae to occur in
the same host galaxy even if the delay time distribution
of the progenitors is quite different.
We note that the MILES stellar population models we
used with pPXF assumes the evolution of single stellar
populations only. While tracking the stellar evolution
and corresponding spectral morphology of single stars is
relatively straightforward, it is fairly complicated in the
case of interacting stars. Though the majority of stars in
the Universe are likely part of a binary (or higher order)
star system (Moe & Di Stefano, 2017), most spectral
synthesis codes ignore the effects that binary (and mul-

91bg-like SNe host galaxies
tiple) stellar evolution have on the integrated light from
galaxies due to the added layer of complexity (e.g. mass
transfer and variation from single star evolutionary pathways) that must be taken into account. However, recent
work has shown that incorporating binary star evolution
models into spectral synthesis analysis codes does indeed
result in different derived physical properties (Stanway
et al., 2016). On the other hand, the difference between
single star spectral synthesis codes, such as GALEXEV,
and binary spectral synthesis programs, like BPASS, is
more prominent at early times, in particular for stellar
ages . 1 Gyr (see Stanway & Eldridge, 2018, fig. 2, right
column). Since the explosion sites that we are probing
mostly consist of relatively old stellar populations, we are
thus not overly concerned that our derived stellar properties are very different from the properties we would
expect those stellar populations to have. A comparison
of derived stellar properties with a spectral synthesis
program that incorporates binaries (such as BPASS) is
beyond the scope of this work, though based on the
work of Stanway & Eldridge (2018), we would plausibly
expect our derived stellar ages to decrease slightly, while
the derived metallicities may slightly increase.
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We obtained integral field observations of the apparent
explosion sites of 17 91bg-like SNe. 11 of these observations yielded spectra of sufficiently high signal-to-noise to
derive information about the stellar population within
∼ 1 kpc projected radius of the explosion site. Using
full-spectrum fitting, we found that the majority of the
stellar populations that host 91bg-like SNe we observe
are dominated by old, metal-rich stars. The majority
lack evidence of recent star formation. We conclude that
the SNe 91bg progenitors are unlikely to be associated
with recent star formation, and likely have delay times
> 6 Gyr. This favors a progenitor model such as that
proposed in Pakmor et al. (2013) or Crocker et al. (2017),
which is composed of a He WD and CO WD.
