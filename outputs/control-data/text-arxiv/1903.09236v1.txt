Abstract
We consider precompact sequential and Fréchet group topologies and
show that some natural constructions of such topologies always result in
metrizable groups answering a question of D. Dikranjan et al. We show
that it is consistent that all sequential precompact topologies on countable groups are Fréchet (or even metrizable). For some classes of groups
(for example boolean) extra set-theoretic assumptions may be omitted
(although in this case such groups do not have to be metrizable).
We also build (using ♦) an example of a countably compact Fréchet
group that is not α3 and obtain a counterexample to a conjecture of
D. Shakhmatov as a corollary.

Introduction

Compact topological groups play a special role throughout mathematics, in
areas ranging from probability theory to harmonic analysis. Locally compact
sequential groups (or even countably tight, see below for the relevant definitions)
are metrizable thus shifting the focus of study to the convergence properties in
groups with weaker compactness conditions. D. Shakhmatov in [12] proposes
a systematic study of sequential and Fréchet properties in countably compact,
and, more generally, precompact topological groups (recall that a topological
group G is precompact if it can be densely embedded as a subgroup of a compact
group).
The Σ-product of ω1 copies of the two element group provides a standard
example of a countably compact Fréchet group that is not first countable. Note
that all countable subgroups of this exapmple are metrizable. Paper [8] began the study of precompact Fréchet topologies on Abelian groups. Among
the results proved in [8] is the consistent existence of a nonmetrizable Fréchet
precompact topology on every infinite countable Abelian group.
In this paper we consider precompact groups that are sequential. We show
that in ZFC, some natural ‘minimal’ precompact topologies on countable groups
are sequential if an only if they are metrizable (Corollary 1), answering a question of D. Dikranjan et. al in [5]. We use the effective topology techniques
pioneered by S. Todorčevic (see [18] and [19]) to study such groups.

In the case of general precompact topologies we show that in some classes of
groups (such as boolean, i.e. satisfying the identity a + a = 0) every countable
precompact sequential group is Fréchet (Corollary 2). We show that consistently, all countable precompact sequential groups may be Fréchet (Theorem 1,
see also Remark 1).
In the final section we construct an example of a countably compact Fréchet
boolean group that is in some sense ‘barely Fréchet’. More precisely, the group
does not have the α3 property of A. Arkhangel’skii (see below for the definitions)
which allows us to disprove a conjecture of D. Shakhmatov mentioned in [13].
We use standard notation and definitions for set-theoretical and topological
concepts (see [9]). All the definitions and properties used in this paper related
to topological groups can be found in [3]. Book [7] is a good reference on
Peter-Weyl theorem for compact groups. We only use a corollary of Peter-Weyl
theorem that states that a precompact group G can be embedded as a subgroup
in a product of U (n)’s. The only propery of U (n) we use is that it is a compact
metric group.
τ
All spaces are assumed to be (completely) regular. We use A to denote the
closure of A in the topology τ (the reference to τ will be omitted if the topology
is clear from the context). We use · and 1 to denote the operation and the unit
in an arbitrary group G. For an Abelian group these become the traditional +
and 0, respecively. If G is a group and D ⊆ G then hDi stands for the subgroup
(algebraically) generated by D (i.e. the smallest subgroup of G that contains
D).
A topological space X is called Fréchet if for any A ⊆ X and any x ∈ A
there exists an S ⊆ A such that S → x (here S → x means S ⊆∗ U for every
open U ∋ x if S is infinite and S = {x} otherwise). More generally, X is called
sequential if for any A ⊆ X such that A 6= A there exists an S ⊆ A such that
S → x ∈ A \ A. Trivially, every Fréchet space is sequential. A free topological
group over a one point compactification of a countable discrete space provides
an easy example of a countable sequential topological group that is not Fréchet.
We use the following intrinsic characterization of precompactness (sometimes
called total boundedness, see [3]): a topological group G is precompact if for any
nonempty open U ⊆ there exists a finite F ⊆ G such that U · F = G (or
F · U = G).

Small precompact groups

A topological group G is called ss-characterized (see [5]) if there exists an S ⊆ G
(called the characterizing sequence) such that the topology of G is the finest
precompact topology in which S → 1.
Recall that a topology τ on a countable set X (considered naturally as a
subset of 2ω in the product topology) is called analytic if τ is a continuous
image of the space of the irrational numbers. Papers [18], [19], and [15] contain
a number of results on sequential spaces with analytic topologies.

Lemma 1. Let G be an ss-characterized countable topological group. Then the
topology of G is analytic.
Proof. Assume
Q G = ω and let S = { mn : n ∈ ω } be the characterizing sequence.
Let U (∞) = n∈ω U (n). Note that for each n ∈ ω the group U (n) is naturally
embedded in U (∞) as a subgroup. Consider the following set
Cn = { p : G → U (n) ⊆ U (∞) : p is an algebraic homomorphism }
Q
Note that for every n ∈ ω the set Cn is a closed subset of g∈G U (∞) in the
topology of pointwise convergence. Given n, m, k ∈ ω each set
Cnm,k = { p ∈ Cn : d(1, p(mi )) < (k + 1)−1 for i > m }
is Borel as are the sets Cnk = ∪m∈ω Cnm,k , C n = ∩k∈ω Cnk and C = ∪n∈ω C n .
Suppose p ∈ C and ǫ > 0. Let k ∈ ω be such that (k + 1)−1 < ǫ. Let
p ∈ C n for some n ∈ ω. Then p ∈ Cnm,k for some m ∈ ω so d(1, p(mi )) <
(k + 1)−1 < ǫ for i > m. Thus S ⊆∗ p−1 (Bǫn ) for evey ǫ > 0 where Bǫn =
{ x ∈ U (n) : d(1, x) < ǫ }. Thus S → 1 in the precompact topology τ generated
on G by the prebase { p−1 (Bǫn ) : ǫ > 0, p ∈ C n }.
Let τ ′ be the maximal precompact topology on G in which S → 1. Let U ⊆ G
be an open neighborhood of 1. By Peter-Weyl theorem there are ǫ1 , . . . , ǫl > 0
and continuous homomorphisms p1 : G → U (n1 ), . . . , pl : G → U (nl ) such
′
ni
that ∩i≤l p−1
i (Bǫi ) ⊆ U . Since S → 1 in τ and pi is continuous, for every
k ∈ ω there is an m ∈ ω such that d(1, pi (mj )) < (k + 1)−1 for all j > m. So
⊆ Cnki for every k ∈ ω. Thus pi ∈ C ni ⊆ C and τ ′ = τ .
pi ∈ Cnm,k
i
Let k ∈ ω and consider the map πk,n : U (n)ω → 2ω given by πk,n (x1 , . . . , xi , . . .) =
(σ1 , . . . , σi , . . .) where σi = 1 if d(xi , 1) < (k + 1)−1 and σi = 0 otherwise. Now
πk,n is a measurable map. Put πk,n (p) = fkp ∈ 2ω where p ∈ C n and fkp (m) = 1
if and only if d(1, p(m)) < (k + 1)−1 . Thus the set B = ∪k,n∈ω πk,n (C n ) ⊆ 2ω is
an analytic set of characteristic functions of some prebase at 1 ∈ G. Thus τ is
analytic by [18], Proposition 3.2(iii).
The following definition is used in several constructions.
Definition 1. Let (X, τ ) be a topological space. Then (X, τ ) is called kω if there
exists a countable family K of subspaces of X such that U ∈ τ if and only if
U ∩ K is relatively open in K for every K ∈ K. We say that τ is determined
by K and write τ = kω (K).
The next simple lemma shows that precompactness and kω are in some sense
orthogonal properties. For a class of countable abelian groups whose topology
is determined by a T -sequence this result was proved in [11], Proposition 2.3.12.
Lemma 2. A kω topological group is precompact if and only if it is compact.
Proof. Let K = { Kn : n ∈ ω } be a countable family of compact subspaces of
G that determines its topology. We may assume 1 ∈ Kn ⊆ Kn+1 for every
n ∈ ω. If G is not compact there exists an infinite closed discrete subset D =
{ dn : n ∈ ω } ⊆ G where dn 6= dm for n 6= m.
By induction build a sequence { On : n ∈ ω } of subsets of G such that
3

(1) 1 ∈ On ⊆ Kn , On is relatively open in Kn
(2) On ⊆ On+1 for every n ∈ ω;
(3) (On · Km ) ∩ D = (Om · Km ) for every m ≤ n.
If On has been built, note that On is compact so for every m ≤ n there
exists an open Onm such that On ⊆ Onm and (Onm · Km ) ∩ D = (On · Km ) ∩ D.
Put On+1 = ∩m≤n Onm ∩ Kn+1 . Properties (1)–(3) are easy to check.
It follows from the choice of K and properties (1) and (2) that O = ∪n∈ω On
is an open neighborhood of 1 in G. Now (3) and the choice of D imply that
(O · Kn ) ∩ D = (On · Kn ) ∩ D is finite for every n ∈ ω.
Now if F ⊆ G is finite there is an n ∈ ω such that F ⊆ Kn . Thus O · F 6= G
for any finite F ⊆ G contradicting the precompactness of G.
The lemmas above can now be used to answer Question 4.6 of [5].
Corollary 1. Every sequential countable subgroup of a countable ss-characterized
group is metrizable.
Proof. Being sequential and analytic by Lemma 1 G is either first countable
or kω by [15], Theorem 1. Since an infinite kω countable group cannot be
precompact by Lemma 2, G is metrizable.
We now turn to the general (i.e. not necessarily definable) precompact countable sequential groups. Recall that a base of open neighborhoods of 1 of a topological group G is called linear if every element of the base is a normal subgroup
of G.
Lemma 3. Every countable sequential group with a linear base is Fréchet.
Proof. Let S → 1 be an arbitrary convergent sequence. Let U ⊆ G be an
open neighborhood of 1 and let V ⊆ U for some open subgroup V ⊆ G. Then
hS \ F i ⊆ V ⊆ U for some finite F ⊆ S. Since hS \ F i does not contain any
isolated points the set hS \ F i cannot be countably compact and thus contains
an infinite closed and discrete subset DF ⊆ hS \ F i. Thus G contains a closed
copy of the space L = {ω} ∪ ω × ω in which the neighborhoods of the only
nonisolated point ω are given by Un = {ω} ∪ ω × (ω \ n).
If G is sequential and not Fréchet it contains a closed copy of the sequential
fan S(ω). This is impossible by Lemma 4 in [4].
Since every torsion (i.e. such that for every g ∈ G, g n = 1 for some n ∈ Z)
compact group has a linear base of open neighborhods of 1 (see, for example, [6])
we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 2. Every countable sequential precompact group of finite exponent
(i.e. such that there is an n ∈ Z with the property that g n = 1 for every g ∈ G,
in particular, every boolean) is Fréchet.

We do not know if the finite exponent restriction above can be dropped
in ZFC. To prove the consistency of the property above for the class of all
precompact sequential groups we need the following lemma.
Lemma 4. Let G be a countable sequential precompact group. Let H be a
countable family of nowhere dense subsets of G. Then there exists an infinite
S ⊆ G such that S → 1 and S ∩ H is finite for every H ∈ H.
Proof. Let H = { Hi : i ∈ ω } be a family of nowhere dense subsets of G with
the property that for every convergent sequence S ⊆ G such that S → 1 there
is an Hi ∈ H such that Hi ∩ S is infinite. By extending H if necessary we may
assume that 1 ∈ H0 , each Hi is closed in G and Hi · F ∈ H for every Hi ∈ H
and every finite F ⊆ G. Let G ⊇ G be a compact group that contains G as a
dense subgroup. Then for each Hi ∈ H its closure Hi in G is nowhere dense
and for any S ⊆ G such that S → g ∈ G there exists an i ∈ ω such that Hi ∩ S
is infinite.
Using recursion, build a countable set D = { di : i ∈ ω } ⊆ G and a family
U = { Ui : i ∈ ω } of open subsets of G such that Ui+1 ⊆ Ui , Ui ∩ (∪j≤i Hj ) = ∅,
and dk ∈ Ui \ { dj : j < k } for every i ∈ ω and k > i.
Note that the set D has the property that for every i ∈ ω there exists an
open set U ⊆ G such that U ∩ D is finite and ∪j≤i Hj ⊆ U .
Let { Fi : i ∈ ω } list all the finite subsets of G. Build, by induction, subsets
Vi ⊆ ∪j≤i Hj so that the following properties are satisfied.
(4) 1 ∈ V0 , each Vi is a relatively open subset of ∪j≤i Hj and Vi ⊆ Vi+1 for
every i ∈ ω;
(5) (Vi · Fj ) ∩ D = (Vj · Fj ) ∩ D for any j ≤ i
Put V0 = H0 . Suppose V0 , . . ., Vi have been built. Note that Vi ⊆ G is
compact and (Vi · ∪j≤i Fj ) ⊆ ∪j<I Hj for some I ∈ ω by (4), and the properties
of H. By the property of D, there exists a subset U ⊇ (Vi · ∪j≤i Fj ), open in
G such that U ∩ D is finite. Using the compactness of Vi , find an open subset
U ′ ⊇ Vi of G such that (U ′ · ∪j≤i Fj ) ⊆ U so F j = (U ′ · Fj ) ∩ D is finite for each
j ≤ i.
Using a similar argument and (5) for each j ≤ i find an open Uj ⊇ Vi such
j
that (US
= (Vi · Fj ) ∩ F j = (Vi · Fj ) ∩ D = (Vj · Fj ) ∩ D. Put
j · Fj ) ∩ F T
Vi+1 = j≤i+1 Hj ∩ j≤i Uj ∩ U ′ .
Define V = ∪i∈ω Vi ∩ G. If F ⊆ G is finite then F = Fi for some i ∈ ω and
by (4) and (5) the set (V · F ) ∩ D = (Vi · Fi ) ∩ D is finite.
Suppose G \ V is not closed. Since G is sequential, there exists an S ⊆ G \ V
such that S → g ∈ V for some g. By the choice of H there exist i, j ∈ ω
such that g ∈ Vi , i ≥ j, and Hj ∩ S is infinite. Since Vi is relatively open in
∪k≤i Hk ⊇ Hj , Vi ∩ S is infinite, contradicting S ∩ V = ∅.
Thus V is a non empty open subset of G such that G 6= V · F for any finite
F ⊆ G contradicting the precompactness of G.

Lemma 4 can be used to show the consistency of the property in Lemma 2
in the class of general precompact countable sequential groups.
Theorem 1. In the model obtained by adding ω2 Cohen reals to a model of CH
every countable precompact sequential group is Fréchet.
Proof. The proof is almost a word-for-word reproduction of the proof of Lemma 7
of [16] so we only give a short outline. Let M be an ω-closed ([M ]ω ⊆ M ) ele+
mentary submodel of H(2c ) of size ω1 such that G, τ̇ ∈ M for some Fn(ω1 , 2)name τ̇ of a sequential precompact topology on G. Let the ground model V
satisfy CH and let G be a Fn(ω1 , 2)-generic set over V . Just as in the proof of
Lemma 7 of [16], one shows that the group (G, τM ) ∈ V [G ∩ M ] is sequential,
where τM consists of G ∩ M -interpretations of sets in τ̇ (α) where α ∈ M (here
τ is interpreted as an ω2 -list of subsets of G). Using elementarity, one shows
that (G, τM ) is also precompact.
The rest of the proof is nearly identical to that of Lemma 7 in [16] and uses
Lemma 4 instead of Lemma 6 of [16].
Remark 1. Lemma 4 may also be used to complement Lemma 16 of [17] in the
proof of Theorem 2 of [17] to obtain a model of ZFC in which every countable
precompact sequential group is metrizable thus generalizing Lemma 1 to the
class of countable precompact sequential groups. The saturation argument that
uses the elementary submodel M in the theorem above is then replaced by the
use of ♦(S12 ) in the ground model and the σ-centeredness of the forcing. We
omit the details.

A Fréchet-Urysohn group.

Recall the definition of αi properties introduced by A. Arkhangel’skii under a
different name. Several of these properites, including a number of variations,
have been independently defined and studied by other authors under different
names although Arkhangle’skii was likely the first to undertake a systematic
study of spaces with these properties. We follow the established notation below.
Definition 2 ([1], [2], see also [12]). Let X be a topological space. For i = 1,
2, 3, and 4 we say that X is an αi -space provided for every countable family { Sn : n ∈ ω } of sequences converging to some point x ∈ X there exists a
‘diagonal’ sequence S converging to x such that:
(α1 ) Sn \ S is finite for all n ∈ ω,
(α2 ) Sn ∩ S is infinite for all n ∈ ω,
(α3 ) Sn ∩ S is infinite for infinitely many n ∈ ω,
(α4 ) Sn ∩ S 6= ∅ for infinitely many n ∈ ω.

6

P. Nyikos (see [10]) noted that αi properties are of great utility in the study
of convergence properties in groups and other algebraic objects. Thus he showed
in [10] that every Fréchet group is α4 . A number of authors have since uncovered various connections (or lack thereof) between αi properties in the presence
of an algebraic structure and other restrictions. Survey [12] provides a fairly
comprehensive overview of these results.
In this section we build an example of a countably compact Fréchet boolean
group that is not α3 . Such a group always has a base of open neighborhoods
of 0 consisting of subgroups (this follows from Pontryagin’s duality, although
in the example below this property can be verified directly) which allows us to
answer a question asked by D. Shakhmatov in 1990.
We borrow some terminology and techniques from [14] for the analysis of
topologies on the boolean group.
Definition 3. Call (G, K) a kω -pair (with respect to τ ) if (G, τ ) is a boolean
topological group with the kω topology τ and K is a countable family of compact
subspaces of G closed under finite sums and intersections such that τ = kω (K)
and ∪K = G.
Lemma 5 ([14]). Let (G, K) be a kω -pair, D′ ⊆ G be infinite, closed and discrete
in kω (K). Then there exists an infinite independent D ⊆ D′ such that hDi is
closed and discrete in kω (K).
The topology of the example will be a simultaneous limit of kω and first
countable precompact topologies. The next definition is a convenient shortcut
and can be viewed as an approximation of the final topology.
Definition 4. Call (G, K, U) a convenient triple if G is a boolean group, U is
a countable family of subgroups closed under finite intersections that forms an
open base of neighborhoods of 0 in some Hausdorff precompact topology τ (U)
on G, and K is a countable family of compact (in τ (U)) subgroups of G closed
under finite sums and intersections such that ∪K = G.
The next lemma was proved in [14].
Lemma 6 ([14]). Let (G, K, U) be a convenient triple, let H be a subgroup of
G closed in kω (K). Then there exists a countable family of open (in kω (K))
subgroups of finite index U0 ⊇ U such that H
H.

τ (U0 )

∩ G = ∩{ U ∈ U0 : H ⊆ U } =

The construction of the example is by an ω1 recursion. Each step consists
of adding a new convergent sequence such that the following properties are
satisfied.
Definition 5. Let (G, K, U) and (G′ , K′ , U ′ ) be convenient triples and an independent D ⊆ G be such that hDi is closed and discrete in kω (K). Call
(G′ , K′ , U ′ ) a primitive sequential extension (pse for short) of (G, K, U) over
D if the following conditions hold:
7

(6) G ⊆ G′ , U

τ (U ′ )

∈ U ′ for every U ∈ U, and K′ is the closure of K ∪ {L}
τ (U ′ )

under finite sums where L = hDi
τ (U ′ )

(7) hD \ F i

(thus L is compact in kω (K′ ));

∩ G = hD \ F i for any F ;

It is easy to show that in the notation above, K ′ = K + L for every K ′ ∈ K′
and some K ∈ K. The proof of the next lemma can be extracted from the
results of [14] but we present it here for the reader’s convenience.
Lemma 7. Let (G, K, U) be a convenient triple and let D ⊆ G be a countable
infinite independent subset such that hDi is closed and discrete in kω (K). Then
there exists a pse (G′ , K′ , U ′ ) of (G, K, U) over D. If D → 0 in τ (U) then
(G′ , K′ , U ′ ) can be chosen so that D → 0 in τ (U ′ ).
Proof. Let F ⊆ D be finite. Use Lemma 6 to find a countable family UF of open
in kω (K) subgroups S
of G of finite index such that hD \ F i = ∩{ U ∈ UF : hD \ F i ⊆ U }.
Let U ′′ = U ∪{ U ∈ F ∈[D]<ω UF : D ⊆∗ U } and let U ′′′ be the closure of U ′′ under finite intersections. Since every element of U ′′′ is a subgroup of finite index
of G open in kω (K) and (G, K, U) is a convenient triple, τ (U ′′′ ) is precompact.
If D → 0 in τ (U) then D → 0 in τ (U ′′′ ) by the choice of U ′′′ .
Let (G′′ , τ ) be the compact group such that G ⊆ G′′ is a dense subgroup
τ
and τ |G = τ (U ′′′ ). Let L = hDi and let K′ be the closure of K ∪ {L} under
τ|

finite sums. Put G′ = G + L ⊆ G′′ and U ′ = { U G : U ∈ U ′′′ }.
Let F ⊆ G and g ∈ G be such that g ∈
6 hD \ F i. If g 6∈ hDi let U ∈ U∅ be
′

τ (U ′ )

.
such that D ⊆ U and g 6∈ U . Then U ∈ U ′′′ is clopen in kω (K) so g 6∈ U
If g ∈ hDi then g 6∈ hD \ {f }i for some f ∈ F ∩ D. Let U ∈ U{f } be such
that D \ {f } ⊆ U and g 6∈ U . The rest of the argument is similar to the case
when g 6∈ hDi. Thus (7) holds. The rest of the properties follow from the
construction.
We now turn to the limit stages of the construction. Let γ be an ordinal.
Suppose for every σ < γ a convenient triple (H σ , Kσ , U σ ) is defined so that the
following conditions hold:
′

′

′

′

(8) H σ ⊆ H σ , Kσ ⊆ Kσ , and U σ ⊆ { U ∩ H σ : U ∈ U σ } if σ ′ ≤ σ < γ;
′

(9) H σ is dense in H σ in kω (Kσ ) for every σ ′ ≤ σ;
Define (H <γ , K<γ , U <γ ) by taking H <γ = ∪σ<γ H σ , K<γ = ∪σ<γ Kσ , U <γ =
kω (K<γ )

: U ∈ U σ , σ < γ }.
′

′
Note that in the case of a successor γ, (H <γ , K<γ , U <γ ) = (H γ , Kγ , U γ )
where γ ′ + 1 = γ.
{U

Lemma 8 ([14]). The family U <γ forms a base of clopen subgroups of finite
index for a precompact group topology τ (U <γ ) on H <γ and each H σ , σ < γ is
dense in H <γ in kω (K<γ ). If γ < ω1 then (H <γ , K<γ , U <γ ) is a convenient
triple.
8

If, in addition to properties (8) and (9), each (H σ , Kσ , U σ ) is a pse of
(H , K<σ , U <σ ) over some D ⊆ H <σ , we will call { (H σ , Kσ , U σ ) : σ < γ }
a pse-chain.
To ensure that the final group does not satisfy α3 the following stronger
property is introduced. Below K will be a element of K for some convenient
triple (G, K, U) and { Sn : n ∈ ω } will be a specially chosen family of convergent
sequences in G.
<σ

(10) let K ⊆ G, then there exists an n(K) ∈ ω such that K ∩ hSn i is finite for
every n > n(K).
The preservation of (10) after adding a new convergent sequence is the subject of the next lemma.
Lemma 9. Let (G, K) be a kω -pair such that each K ∈ K satisfies (10). Suppose
also that each Sn ⊆ K(n) for some K(n) ∈ K. Let D ⊆ G be an infinite set such
that hDi is closed and discrete in G. Then for every K ∈ K the set K + hDi
satisfies (10).
Proof. Let K ∈ K and n(K) ∈ ω be such that K ∩ hSn i is finite for every
n > n(K). Note that K + hSn i is compact in kω (K) so F = hDi ∩ (K + hSn i)
is finite for every n ∈ ω. If n > n(K) the set F ′ = K ∩ hSn i is finite. Suppose
d ∈ hDi, s ∈ hSn i, and a ∈ K are such that a + d = s. Then d ∈ F =
{ ai + si : ai ∈ K, si ∈ hSn i, i ∈ |F | } so s = a + ai + si for some i ∈ |F | and
a + ai ∈ F ′ = { f j : j ∈ |F ′ | }. Thus s = f j + si for some i ∈ |F |, j ∈ |F ′ |.
Hence K + hDi ∩ hSn i is finite for every n > n(K).
The first step of the construction is given in the following simple lemma.
Lemma 10. There exists a convenient triple (G, K, U) such that there are infinite countable independent sets Sn ⊆ G where Sn → 0 for every n ∈ ω and for
any K ∈ K there exists an n ∈ ω such that K ∩ hSn i = ∅.
Proof. It is straightforward to construct a compact boolean group T = hSi
where S → 0 is an infinite independent subset. Let G be the inductive limit of
T n , n ∈ ω, and τ (U) be the topology inherited from the product topology on
T ω . Put Sn = {0}n−1 × S. Note that the topology of G is determined by the
family K = { T n : n ∈ ω }. All the properties of (G, K, U) are easy to check.
We now present the recursive construction of the main example. Since all
the groups Gα in the construction have cardinality 2ω we will assume that
every Gα is a subgroup (algebraically) of 2ω . Let { Cα : α < ω1 } ⊆ [2ω ]ω and
{ Pα : α < ω1 } ⊆ [2ω ]ω be some families of subsets of 2ω .
Let (G0 , K0 , U0 ) = (G, K, U) where the convenient triple (G, K, U) and the
sets Sn ⊆ G have been constructed in Lemma 10. Below we use the notation
cCα for the closure of Cα in kω (K<α ).
Lemma 11. There exists a pse-chain { (Gα , Kα , Uα ) : α < ω1 } such that

9

(11) every K ∈ Kα satisfies (10);
(12) if Pα ⊆ G<α is an infinite subset that is closed and discrete in kω (K<α )
then there exists an infinite Sα ⊆ Pα such that Sα → sα in kω (Kα) );
kω (K<α )

(13) if 0 ∈ Pα
in kω (Kα) );

τ (U<α )

(14) if 0 ∈ cCα
in kω (Kα );

then there exists an infinite Sα ⊆ Pα such that Sα → 0

then there exists an infinite Tα ⊆ Cα such that Tα → 0
τ (U<α )

Proof. Let D′ ⊆ G<α be such that 0 ∈ D′
and there is no S ⊆ D′ such
′
that S → 0 in kω (K<α ). Pick an infinite D ⊆ D such that D → 0 in τ (U<α ).
Then D is closed and discrete in kω (K<α ) so using Lemma 5 we may assume
that hDi is closed and discrete in kω (K<α ). Apply Lemma 7 to construct a pse
(Gα , Kα , Uα ) of (G<α , K<α , U<α ) over D such that D → 0 in kω (Kα ).
Using either Pα of cCα in place of D′ , the argument in the previous paragraph, and putting Sα = D one can show that (13) and (14) are satisfied.
Property (12) can be treated using a similar construction (note that the conditions for (12) and (13) are mutually exclusive) by omitting the condition that
D → 0 in τ (U<α ).
Since hDi was chosen to be closed and discrete in kω (K<α ), Lemma 9 implies
τ (Uα )

for some
that K + hDi satisfies (10). If K ′ ∈ kω (Kα ) then K ′ = K + hDi
K ∈ kω (K<α ). Suppose g ∈ K ′ ∩ Sn for some n ∈ ω. Then g = a + d for some
τ (Uα )

a ∈ K and d ∈ hDi
. Since g ∈ G<α , d ∈ G<α so by (7) d ∈ hDi. Thus K ′
satisfies (10) and (11) holds.
We next show that when the families Cα and Pα are chosen to have some
special properties, the construction of Lemma 11 results in a desired group.
Suppose ♦ holds and let { Cα : α < ω1 } be a ♦-sequence. Identifying ω1
and 2ω we may assume that each Cα ⊆ 2ω . Let { Pα : α < ω1 } list all infinite
countable subsets of 2ω so that each Pα is listed ω1 times.
Lemma 12. Let (Gω1 , Kω1 , Uω1 ) = (G<ω1 , K<ω1 , U<ω1 ) where (Gα , Kα , Uα ),
α < ω1 have been constructed in Lemma 11. Then kω (Kω1 ) = τ (Uω1 ), Gω1 is
countably compact, Fréchet, and not α3 .
Proof. Suppose A ⊆ Gω1 is such that 0 6∈ A, A ∩ K is closed for every K ∈ Kω1
and A ∩ U 6= ∅ for every U ∈ Uω1 .
Let θ be large enough. Consider the sets of the form A ∩ M where M
is a countable elementary submodel of H(θ) and X ∈ M is a countable set
containing the details of the construction of Gω1 . The set
{ γ ∈ ω1 : γ = M ∩ ω1 , X ∈ M, M ≤ H(θ) }
is a club in ω1 . Thus Cγ = A ∩ M for some γ < ω1 where M ∩ ω1 = γ. Note
that γ < ω1 is a limit and cCγ = A ∩ G<γ .
10

Let U ∈ Uα for some α < γ. Then U
a K ∈ Kβ and a g ∈ A ∩ K ∩ U

kω (Kβ )

kω (Kω1 )

∈ τ (Uω1 ) so there exists a β ≥ α,

by the choice of A. By elementarity, we
kω (K<γ )

τ (U<γ )

. Thus 0 ∈ cCγ
may assume that β < γ and g ∈ M so g ∈ A ∩ U
and by (14) there exists a Tγ ⊆ cCγ ⊆ A such that Tγ → 0 in kω (Kγ ). This
shows that kω (Kω1 ) = τ (Uω1 ).
Now simple arguments show that (12) implies the countable compactness of
kω (Kω1 ), (13) implies that kω (Kω1 ) is Fréchet, and (11) implies that kω (Kω1 ) is
not α3 .
Lemmas 11 and 12 now imply the following theorem.
Theorem 2 (♦). There exists a countably compact boolean Fréchet group that
is not α3 .
The next corollary provides a counterexample to Conjecture 9.4 in [13] and
a partial negative answer to Question 4.3 in [12].
Corollary 3 (♦). There exists a precompact countable Fréchet boolean group
G with a base of neighborhoods of 0 consisting of subgroups of finite index such
that G is not α3 .
Proof. Let G be the countable group algebraically generated by the sheaf that
provides a counterexample to the α3 property in the group from Theorem 2.

Questions.

Corollary 2 and Theorem 1 (see also the remark following Theorem 1) leave
open a number of natural questions. The question below seems to be open even
for Z.
Question 1. Is every countable precompact sequential group Fréchet in ZFC?
A negative answer to Question 1 would follow from a negative answer to
Question 2 below (in ZFC). Such a negative answer would also allow the (consistent) extension of the conclusion of Theorem 1 to the class of all (not necessarily
countable) precompact groups.
Question 2. Can a precompact sequential group contain a closed copy of S(ω)?
The conclusion of Lemma 1 can be generalized to groups having the maximal
precompact topology in which a countable family of sequences converge to 1.
A more careful proof shows that when ‘countable’ is replaced by ‘analytic’ the
resulting topology can be shown to be coanalytic (i.e. a complement of some
analytic set). Note also that it can be shown that the set of convergent sequences
of a space with an analytic topology is coanalytic. This leads to the following
natural question.

11

Question 3. Let G be a countable group and S ⊆ 2G be a Borel (analytic,
coanalytic) family of subsets. Let τ be the maximal precompact group topology
on G such that S → 1 in τ for each S ∈ S. Must τ be analytic?
The result of Theorem 2 hints at the possible positive answers to the next
two questions. Note that such groups do not exist in ZFC alone and cannot be
α3 . Thus a positive answer to one of the questions below would strengthen the
conclusion of Theorem 2.
Question 4. Do there exist countably compact Fréchet groups H and G such
that H × G is not Fréchet?
Question 5. Does there exist a countably compact Fréchet group whose square
is not Fréchet?
