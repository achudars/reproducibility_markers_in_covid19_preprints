ABSTRACT
We have presented previously a general treatment of Starobinsky-like inflation in no-scale

supergravity where the tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 3(1 − ns )2 , and ns is the tilt of the scalar
perturbations. In particular, we have shown how this scenario can be unified with modulus
fixing, supersymmetry breaking and a small cosmological constant. In this paper we extend
these constructions to inflationary models based on generalized no-scale structures. In particular,
we consider alternative values of the curvature parameter, α < 1, as may occur if not all the
complex Kähler moduli contribute to driving inflation, as well as α > 1, as may occur if complex
structure moduli also contribute to driving inflation. In all cases, we combine these α-Starobinsky
inflation models with supersymmetry breaking and a present-day cosmological constant, allowing
for additional contributions to the vacuum energy from stages of gauge symmetry breaking.

Introduction

Inflation [1] provides a very successful phenomenological framework for describing the largescale structure of the universe, including its near-flatness, the smallness of the primordial
density perturbations measured in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), their small
tilt ns ' 0.965 and their consistency with a Gaussian white-noise spectrum [2]. That said,
further tests remain to be made, e.g., via the existence and spectrum of tensor perturbations
[3]. However, the successes of inflation motivate attempts to relate it to the Standard Model
(SM) of laboratory particle physics on the one hand and, on the other hand, to a candidate
quantum theory of everything including gravity, such as string theory. The characteristic
energy scale of inflation is presumably intermediate between those of the SM and quantum
gravity, and models of inflation may provide a welcome bridge between them.
These considerations have long since been a motivation for models of inflation [4–7]
based on no-scale supergravity [8–11]. This is the generic form of effective field theory
that arises in the low-scale limit of string compactifications [12], and the persistence of
supersymmetry down to a scale below the inflation scale would help its stabilization [13],
as well as that of the electroweak scale [14].
The upper limit on the ratio r of tensor perturbations in the CMB relative to the
measured scalar density perturbations [3] is entirely consistent with the original model of
inflation proposed by Starobinsky [15], which was based on R + R2 gravity and leads to
a small tilt [16] and a small value of r ∼ 0.003. A range of larger values of r are also
compatible with the CMB data, as are and smaller values, but the successes of this simple
model have led us to explore Starobinsky-like inflationary avatars of no-scale supergravity.
Our first example of this type was based on a minimal Wess-Zumino form of superpotential
[17–22], but other examples have emerged that are based on other forms of superpotential
[18,23–32]. In a recent paper we gave a general classification of Starobinsky-like inflationary
avatars of no-scale supergravity [20], and we showed subsequently how such models could
be extended to a unified no-scale model of inflation, supersymmetry breaking and dark
energy [21].
The no-scale inflationary models described in the previous paragraph were all based
on the simplest incarnation of no-scale supergravity with a Kähler potential that could be
written in the form [9, 10]

parametrizing a SUSU
coset Kähler manifold with the choice α = 1, corresponding to

an Einstein space with curvature R = 2/α = 2. In this case, the prefactor 3 guarantees
that in the absence of a superpotential the effective potential vanishes. Hence it is a

2

fortiori independent of the field T , which may correspond to a generic compactification
volume modulus, and also φ, which represents a generic chiral matter field. The no-scale
model (1) with α = 1 was the starting-point for our recent classification of Starobinsky-like
models of inflation [20] and their extension to include supersymmetry breaking and dark
energy [21]. The possibility of constructing inflationary models with different values of α
was first discussed in [18], where it was noted that for α . O(1) such models predict
ns ' 1 −

where N∗ is the number of e-folds of inflation. Similar models were later discussed in more
detail in [27,33–39], where they were termed α-attractors. Here we give a general treatment
of the construction of no-scale Starobinsky-like inflationary models with α 6= 1.
There are two directions in which the no-scale framework can be generalized: one is
to consider Kähler manifolds that are direct products of irreducible components, i.e., their
P
Kähler potentials take the form K = n Kn where each Kn is of no-scale type, and the
other is to consider no-scale coset manifolds parametrized by multiple chiral fields, e.g., of
(N,1)
: N > 2. In the former case, each of the Kn is of logarithmic form,
the forms SUSU
(N )×U (1)
but they may have different prefactors. For example, in the case of multiple
one may postulate:

K = −3

where the quantities αn are positive, in general. Alternatively, the single-coset Kähler
potential would be generalized to multiple chiral fields:

i=1
and these two options may be combined.
In Witten’s original model for string compactification based on the dimensional reduction of 10-dimensional supergravity [12], there was a single compactification volume
modulus T with a Kähler potential of the form (1) with α = 1. However, in a more general
class of string compactifications one expects three complex Kähler moduli Tn : n = 1, 2, 3
with a combined Kähler potential of the form (3) with α1 = α2 = α3 = 1/3. This opens up
two additional options for inflation, using either a single complex modulus with α = 1/3,
or a pair linked together as an ‘area’ modulus in a single logarithmic Kähler potential with
an effective prefactor α = 2/3. These were the possibilities mentioned in [18].
However, there are other chiral fields that one expects to appear in the effective
supergravity theory derived from general string theory compactifications. For example,
one generally encounters a complex dilaton/axion field S and some number of complex
3

structure moduli U a . In general, the dynamical framework for each of these is again a
logarithmic non-compact coset Kähler potential, and a popular example is the ST U model:

in which case the values of 3αn in (3) can take integer values ≤ 7 and can arise if inflation
is driven by some linked combination of the S, T n and U a fields, as discussed in [39].
In a previous paper [20] we presented a general classification of Starobinsky-like in(2,1)
no-scale supergravity in the case α = 1, discussing explicit
flationary avatars of SUSU
(2)×U (1)
forms of superpotentials and relations between them. More recently we have shown how
supersymmetry breaking and a small cosmological constant could be incorporated in such
models [21]. In this paper we extend these constructions to models with α 6= 1, and also
(N,1)
no-scale supergravity.
consider the generalization to models based on SUSU
(N )×U (1)
The structure of this paper is as follows. In section 2.1, we review briefly the supergravity framework we employ. We describe the construction of Minkowski and de Sitter
vacua for models with multiple moduli and matter fields in section 2.2. Some general features of α-Starobinsky models are given in section 2.3. We then go on to consider unified
no-scale model, i.e., models that combine Starobinsky-like inflation, Standard Model (SM)like phenomenology and supersymmetry breaking, leaving open the possibility of non-zero
and positive vacuum energy after inflation. We first consider minimal models with a single
modulus and a single matter field in section 3.1. While there are many forms possible for
the superpotential giving rise to Starobinsky inflation, they cannot all be implemented in
conjunction with supersymmetry breaking and de Sitter vacua. Indeed, as we show, in
many cases when the inflationary superpotential is perturbed, the minimum of the potential is shifted to a supersymmetry preserving anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacuum. We generalize
these models in section 3.2 by adding multiple moduli and matter fields and allowing for
an arbitrary curvature parameter, α. The general construction of α-Starobinsky models
with supersymmetry breaking is developed in section 4. Some discussion of ST U models
is given in section 5, and we summarize in section 6.

2.1

De Sitter Vacua and No-Scale Attractors
A Brief Review of Supergravity

We first recall some general features of no-scale supergravity [11] that will be useful for our
analysis. A generic supergravity theory and its geometric properties are characterized by a

4

Kähler potential K(Φi , Φ†j ), where Φi are the chiral fields, and Φ†j are the conjugate fields.
Their kinetic energy terms take the general form:
Lkin = Kij ∂µ Φi ∂ µ Φ†j ,

(6)

where Kij ≡ ∂ 2 K/∂µ Φi ∂ µ Φ†j is the Kähler metric. Setting aside the D-terms associated
with gauge interactions, the N = 1 supergravity effective scalar potential is given by (see
e.g., [40]):

where the Kähler function is defined as G ≡ K + ln W + ln W † , where K is Hermitian

and W is holomorphic, and (K −1 )j is the inverse of the Kähler metric. The kinetic energy
terms (6) and the effective scalar potential expression (7) together yield the corresponding
supergravity action for the chiral fields:
Z

√ h
S =

(8)
We introduce the following definition of the Kähler covariant derivative:
Di W ≡ ∂i W + Ki W
Di W ≡ ∂ i W − K i W ,

(9)

in terms of which the scalar mass-squared matrix is given by:

whose diagonalization yields the mass eigenvalues of the scalar fields Φi . We assume that

(11)

where m3/2 is the mass of the gravitino, which is given by m3/2 ≡ eG/2 , and F -term

supersymmetry breaking is obtained when i |Fi |2 > 0 at the minimum.
To understand better the geometric properties of this framework, we recall that the

Kähler curvature for an SUSU
Kähler manifold can be calculated from the following
(N )×U (1)
expression [10]:
Rij = (log det Gba )ji ,

(14)

which reduces to the familiar result R = 2/3 in minimal SUU(1,1)
no-scale supergravity when

N = 1 and α = 1. Note that, because R depends on the total number of chiral fields in the
theory, we cannot determine the Kähler curvature R from the cosmological observables ns
and r alone, though one can in general write

(15)

for α . O(1).

2.2

Minkowski Pair Formulation

Before considering the generalized construction of unified no-scale models of inflation, suP
persymmetry breaking and dark energy, we first show how Kähler potentials K = n Kn ,
where Kn is a Kähler potential of no-scale type, can yield de Sitter (dS) vacuum solutions.
We adopt the Minkowski pair formulation that was first considered in [41, 42], which we
use to incorporate an adjustable parameter for supersymmetry breaking and dark energy.
We write the general form of the Kähler potential that parametrizes a non-compact
coset space in the form:

SU (N,1)
SU (N )×U (1)

K = −3 α ln(V),

(16)

where α is the curvature parameter discussed previously, and we introduce the notation
V ≡ T + T† −

N
−1
X
i=1

φi φ†i
.

(17)

As mentioned in the Introduction, the field T may represent a compactification volume
modulus and the φi are matter fields. In order to construct successfully dS vacuum solutions, we assume that the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the imaginary field
components are fixed to zero, i.e., T † = T and φ†i = φi . This condition can always be
achieved dynamically by introducing into the Kähler potential (4) higher-order terms that
stabilize the volume modulus field T in the imaginary direction [43], as discussed later in
this section.
We introduce the following notation:
V −→ ξ when T † = T and φ†i = φi ,
6

(18)

so that Eq. (17) becomes:
ξ = 2T −

N
−1
X
i=1

φ2i
.
3

(19)

We recover Minkowski vacua solutions by considering the following form of superpotential:
WM = λ · ξ n± ,

(20)

√
where n± = 32 (α ± α) [9], and λ is an arbitrary constant. If we combine the pair of
Minkowski solutions ξ n− and ξ n+ with coefficients λ1,2 , we obtain a superpotential:
WdS = λ1 · ξ n− − λ2 · ξ n+

(21)

that yields a de Sitter vacuum with the following scalar potential:
V = 12 λ1 λ2 .

(22)

This can be interpreted as the dark energy density, and we recover a positive cosmological
constant if λ1 and λ2 have the same sign. In the absence of additional contributions to the
vacuum energy density, the product λ1 λ2 should be very small, namely O(10−120 ) in Planck
units. We note that, as discussed in [21] and seen later, the difference between λ1 − λ2
controls the magnitude of supersymmetry breaking, which is & O(10−16 ) in natural units,
so one might expect a large hierarchy between λ1 and λ2 . However, one does in fact expect
additional contributions to the vacuum density from gauge phase transitions, as we discuss
in more detail below.
In this formulation, the potential is given by (22) everywhere in the N -dimensional
field space corresponding to the real directions of T and the φi . However, in general there
may be instabilities along the imaginary directions. The scalar masses in the imaginary
direction can be computed using, Eq. (10) (the masses in the real direction are obviously
zero):

where we assume that ξ ≥ 1. Thus we see that the the imaginary parts of all the matter
fields φi acquire identical masses, as was to be expected from the symmetric structure of
the Kähler potential (16).
We see in (23) that when α < 1 there is an instability in the imaginary direction of
T , and (24) shows that this potentially the case also for the imaginary part of φ. These
instabilities can be removed by introducing stabilization terms in the Kähler potential and
7

the inflationary potential. For example, one can introduce higher-order stabilization terms
in the Kähler potential (4) such as postulated in [18, 43]:

The quartic stabilization term β T − T † does not change the potential in the real direction but stabilizes it in the imaginary direction. If, as an example, we fix our fields to
hT i = 12 and hφi = 0, Eq. (23) becomes:
m2Im

(26)

which can always be stabilized with a suitable choice of β.
We can extend this framework to more general Kähler potential structures, in which
we consider a combination of P + 1 no-scale type Kähler potentials [42], with a Kähler
potential of the form:
P
+1
X
αn ln(Vn ).
(27)
K = −3
n=1

For simplicity, we consider a case in which the first term in this sum contains N matter
(N,1)
fields that all belong to a single non-compact SUSU
Kähler coset manifold, which
(N )×U (1)
is denoted as K1 = −3 α1 ln(V1 ), and the remaining P no-scale type Kähler potentials
are each described by a non-compact SUU(1,1)
coset space. Thus, the Kähler potential (27)
(1)
becomes:

Minkowski vacuum solutions. Just as was done before, we restrict our attention to the real
directions of the chiral fields, so that,
Vi −→ ξi , when T n = Tn† ,

φi = φ†i .

(30)

As previously, this requirement can always be achieved dynamically by introducing higherorder stabilization terms, as we discuss in more detail when we consider multi-field inflationary models in the next section.

−r. For convenience, we adopt a notation in which the antipodal vector is written as
r̄ = −r, so that all our expressions can be expressed in terms of the radial components rn .
The superpotential (32) yields the effective scalar potential V = 12 λ1 λ2 at the extremum
with hT n i = 21 and hφi i = 0. This extremum might not always be stable, and its stability
should be investigated case by case, but (as discussed previously) the de Sitter minimum
can always be stabilized in the imaginary direction by introducing the quartic stabilization
4
terms βn T n − Tn† in the Kähler potential (27), a point that we discuss in detail when we
combine the dark energy and supersymmetry breaking sector with the inflationary sector.

2.3

α-Starobinsky models

It is well-known that the no-scale formalism we have been discussing is suitable for producing inflationary models of the Starobinsky type [17–32]. Indeed, for α = 1, there are many
known examples of superpotentials that lead to a Starobinsky potential for inflation. The
Wess-Zumino model [17], in which the inflaton is associated with a matter field, and the
Cecotti model [44], in which the inflaton is associated with T , are the two cases most often
considered. It has also been shown [20] that these models can be related through the un(N,1)
derlying SUSU
symmetry of the non-compact no-scale coset space, and we show later
(N )×U (1)
how models with a matter inflaton can be extended to arbitrary values of the curvature
parameter, α.

It is interesting to note the correspondence between the R2 (de Sitter) and R+R2 (Starobinsky) theories of gravity and no-scale supergravity [19]. The supergravity Lagrangian written
in terms of an Einstein-Hilbert action requires a conformal transformation, which can be
expressed in terms of the Kähler potential 2Ω = −K/3 [45]. The details of the correspondence then lie in the choice of the superpotential. The pure R2 case requires the choice
of W given in (21), and the superpotential for the R + R2 models is discussed in the next
section.
We note here that the Starobinsky potential can be generalized by changing the
Kähler curvature to α 6= 1. In this case, the corresponding conformal transformation is
related to the Kähler potential by 2Ω = −K/3α and the α-Starobinsky scalar potential
becomes (again with a suitable choice of superpotential)

The cosmological observables for α-Starobinsky potential (37) are given by (2). Our goal
in the following is to unify no-scale models that incorporate the α-Starobinsky inflationary
model (or a general no-scale attractor inflationary potential) at a scale O(1013 ) GeV, with
an adjustable scale for supersymmetry breaking and a cosmological constant O(10−120 ).
To achieve such unification, we must stabilize strongly the volume modulus T , an aspect
that is deferred to the next section.
For illustration, we plot α-Starobinsky potential forms with different values of α in
Fig. 1. We can see from the Figure that increasing the value of the curvature parameter

blue line corresponds to the original Starobinsky inflationary potential with α = 1, the yellow line
corresponds to α = 5, the green line corresponds to α = 10, and the orange line corresponds to
α = 30.

α stretches the Starobinsky potential horizontally, reducing the flatness of the plateau at
any fixed value of φ0 .
We show in Fig. 2 the predicted cosmological observables for these α-Starobinsky potentials in the (ns , r) plane, together with the results of the Planck collaboration combined
with other CMB data, indicated by blue shadings corresponding to the 68% and 95% confidence level regions [2] 1 . As the curvature parameter α increases, the value of the scalar
tilt ns changes only slightly and stays within the range ∼ 0.96 − 0.97, while the tensor-toscalar ratio r increases with the value of α. The CMB data set a a 68% upper bound on
the tensor-to-scalar ratio r ∼ 0.055, which is attained for α ∼ 51 when ns ∼ 0.967 for a
nominal choice of N∗ ≈ 55, as indicated by the blue star. The green dots and line at small
r show the prediction of the original Starobinsky model, corresponding to the case α = 1.
It is apparent that future measurements of r will be able to constrain α more significantly,
1

Note that the α-Starobinsky predictions include corrections beyond the small-α values shown in (2),
since they were calculated by numerical integration of the equation of motion for the inflaton field. Similar predictions were shown in Fig. 1 of [33], but corrections of higher order in α are absent from the
corresponding α-attractor predictions in Fig. 1 of [39] and Fig. 8 of [2].

and that more precise measurements of ns could in principle constrain ns , thereby N∗ and
hence the post-inflationary history of the Universe, which is sensitive to the decay of the
inflaton into low-mass particles [29].

Unified No-Scale Models
Supersymmetry Breaking and Inflationary Dynamics

We now show how one can combine the dark energy sector WdS with various inflationary
models to obtain a unified no-scale supergravity model. Because we want to consider
Minkowski pair models that break supersymmetry, we impose the condition that WI does
not break the supersymmetry at the minimum. For simplicity, we consider models based

on a non-compact SUSU
coset space with curvature parameter set to α = 1, i.e., the
(2)×U (1)
12

Kähler potential given in Eq. (1). In order to incorporate supersymmetry breaking via the
Minkowski pair superpotential WdS , we need to consider specific inflationary superpotential
forms that do not lead to unphysical supersymmetry-preserving AdS vacua states. It
can readily be shown that the Minkowski pair construction combined with an arbitrary
superpotential that is a function of the volume modulus T only, WI = f (T ), can give dS
vacuum states with broken supersymmetry. However, we do not consider such models here
because, as discussed in [18], superpotentials of this form cannot lead to Starobinsky-like
inflationary potentials with unbroken supersymmetry at the minimum.
It was shown in [17] that the Starobinsky model of inflation can be obtained from
the Wess-Zumino form of superpotential, which is a function of the matter-like field φ only.
Thus, we are led to consider the following inflationary superpotential form:
WI = f (φ),

(38)

where we assume that the minimum is located at hφi = 0. The superpotential (38) yields
the following compact form of scalar potential:
f 0 (φ)2
V =
2 .
φ2
2T − 3

(39)

and requiring vanishing vacuum energy at the minimum imposes the condition f 0 (0) = 0.
If we also require the minimum to be supersymmetric, we have DT WI = ∂T WI + KT WI '
−3f (φ) = 0, which implies that f (0) = 0 2 .
We can now combine the inflaton superpotential (38) with the Minkowski pair superpotential WdS , obtaining

We can see from these expressions that, as long as the condition f 0 (0) = 0 is satisfied,
the position of the minimum does not shift when the dark energy superpotential WdS
is introduced. In addition, at the minimum the effective scalar potential (41) reduces
to the dS vacua solutions V = 12 λ1 λ2 . While the F -term for φ remains zero (when
φ = 0 and f 0 (0) = 0 at the minimum), the F -term for T is proportional to DT W =
−3 (f (φ) + λ1 + λ2 ) = −3(λ1 + λ2 ), indicating that supersymmetry is broken. Thus we have
shown that supersymmetry breaking with a positive cosmological constant can be achieved
if one considers an inflationary superpotential of the form WI = f (φ).
However, the dark energy sector cannot be combined with a general superpotential of
the form WI = F (T, φ). To illustrate that, we consider the following superpotential form:
WI = F (T, φ) = f (T ) · φ.

(44)

We obtain from (44) the following scalar potential:

We see from this that the minimum must be located at hφi = 0, and we assume that the
minimum is also at hT i = 1/2. Using this condition, we obtain the following expression for
the derivative with respect to T at the minimum:
VT = 2f (1/2) [f 0 (1/2) − 2f (1/2)] ,

(47)

which shows that at the minimum we must also satisfy the condition f (1/2) = 0, which
also guarantees V = 0 at the minimum.
Next, we combine the inflationary superpotential (44) with the dark energy sector:

The minimum of this more complicated scalar potential is shifted to a new position. To
find this shift, we consider small perturbations around the initial minimum, given by:
f (n) (1/2 + δt) ≈ f (n) (1/2) + f (n+1) (1/2) · δt,

with n = 0, 1, 2,

(50)

and
hφi + δφ = δφ.

(51)

Using these perturbations in the scalar potential (49), we find:

δφ ≈

f (1/2)2

(52)

which yields the following effective scalar potential at the minimum:
V ≈ −3 (λ1 − λ2 )2 ,

(53)

We see from (53) that, when λ1 6= λ2 , the minimum always shifts to a supersymmetrypreserving AdS vacuum, at least for small λ1,2 .
√
The Cecotti form of the superpotential WI = 3M φ(T − 1/2) [44] falls into the
category of superpotentials that is not suitable for combination with our Minkowski pair
formulation of broken supersymmetric dS solutions. We argued previously [20] for an
equivalence among the many avatars of superpotentials yielding Starobinsky inflation based
on an the underlying SU(2,1) invariance. However, when WdS is added to the theory, this
invariance is broken and the avatars are no longer equivalent. Therefore, in the remainder of
the paper, we combine the dark energy superpotential WdS with inflationary superpotentials
that are functions of matter fields only. More general forms for W (T, φ) may be possible,
but we have not explored the general conditions on W and its derivatives for models other
than the three sets of models that have attracted most interest in this context.
We note that the inflationary superpotential WI contains a single parameter, denoted
by M , which is not of order unity. In the Wess-Zumino model discussed in more detail
below, M corresponds to the inflaton mass and its magnitude is set by the normalization
of the scalar density perturbations [2], so that M ' 1.2 × 10−5 MP ' 3 × 1013 GeV. In
15

contrast, the constants in WdS must be significantly smaller. Supersymmetry breaking is
characterized by an F -term of the form in Eq. (11) and is given by:
2
X

|Fi |2 = FT2 =

i=1

(λ1 + λ2 )2
,
α

(54)

where the supersymmetry breaking is generated through an F -term for T . For α = 1,
FT = (λ1 + λ2 ), and the gravitino mass is given by:
m3/2 = eG/2 = eK/2 W = (λ1 − λ2 )

(55)

at the minimum, and is independent of α. Thus we expect the difference of the two
parameters to be of order 10−16 in Planck units. Hence the terms in potential (41) that
are coupled to λ1,2 can be safely neglected during inflation, and do not affect the slow-roll
dynamics.
We recall that the vacuum energy density at the minimum is given by Λ = 12λ1 λ2 ,
Thus, in the absence of any phase transitions, we must require 12λ1 λ2 ∼ O(10−120 ), which
is possible if one of the two constants is hierarchically much smaller than the other, e.g.,
λ1 ∼ 10−15 and λ2 ∼ 10−105 . However, we know that the vacuum energy today (i.e., the
cosmological constant) is a sum of contributions that have changed during phase transitions
throughout the history of the Universe. For example, the electroweak transition would
make a contribution ∼ −O(10−60 ), which could be cancelled to a sufficiently small value if
λ1 ∼ 10−15 and λ2 ∼ 10−45 . However, a grand unified (GUT) transition would plausibly
make a contribution ∼ −O(10−30 ), corresponding to vacuum energy of ∼ 1011 GeV as is
2
typical in flipped SU(5) models where the vacuum energy is related to m23/2 MGU
T (see,
−15
e.g., [46]) which could be cancelled by λ1 ∼ λ2 ∼ 10
to provide a suitable cosmological
constant today, Without loss of generality, we can define:
λ1 = λ̃1 M 3

λ2 = λ̃2 M 3 ,

(56)

and we return below to the possibility of a cancellation when we discuss the Wess-Zumino
model in more detail.

Multi-field No-Scale Attractors with Supersymmetry Breaking

It is relatively straightforward to generalize the previous results to multi-field no-scale at(N,1)
tractors. We consider the Kähler potential (28) that parametrizes a non-compact SUSU
×
(N )×U (1)
h

φi , which will be associated with inflaton fields, are described by the no-scale Kähler potential K1 = −3α1 ln(V1 ), where the function V1 is given by (17). The multi-field no-scale
attractors will be characterized by a curvature parameter α1 .
As discussed in the previous Section, we assume that the superpotential associated
with inflation is a function of matter fields only. Thus, the unified superpotential can be
expressed as:
W = WI + WdS = f (φ) + λ1 ·

where WI = f (φ), and φ ≡ {φ1 , φ2 , ..., φN −1 }. Exactly as before, we require that at the
minimum WI = f (0) = 0 and f 0 (0) = 0. We assume that the chiral fields at the minimum
obtain vacuum expectation values hT n i = 21 and hφi i = 0, and in this case the gravitino
mass becomes m3/2 = λ1 −λ2 , also as before, while the F -term giving rise to supersymmetry

where ∂i f (φ) ≡ ∂f∂φ(φ)
. We can identify four distinct contributions to to V . The first term

is once again the vacuum energy density after inflation. The second term is proportional
to f 2 and is potentially dangerous, as it could seriously impact the inflaton potential. The
third term is the generalization of the inflaton potential, and the final term is related to the
supersymmetry-breaking terms. These terms can be neglected during inflation, as λi  M .
In order to safeguard Starobinsky-like inflation, we must ensure the absence of the
second term. There are two ways to achieve this. The first is rather obvious, namely we
could require

However, there is a more elegant (and general) solution to this problem, which at the same
time simplifies the scalar potential. The key is to couple our inflationary potential to the
Minkowski vacuum solution, given by (31). Thus, we consider the following superpotential
form:
W = WdS + WM · WI ,
(61)
which amounts to adding f (φ) to either λ1 or λ2 in Eq. (31). Thus, we can couple the
inflationary superpotential in two different ways: either

We note that the scalar potentials (63) and (65) have relatively simple forms. Once again,
the first term in each equation is the vacuum energy density after inflation, and the second
term, while proportional to f (φ), is rendered harmless as it is proportional to one of the
two small coefficients λi . The third term in each case leads to α-Starobinsky inflation. We
need only impose the conditions that f (φ) and f 0 (φ) are zero at the minimum.
As mentioned previously, to stabilize the moduli fields T n dynamically at their vacuum
expectation values to hT n i = 12 , we introduce quartic stabilization terms [18, 43] in the
(N,1)
Kähler potential. Thus, the complete Kähler potential based on non-compact SUSU

Inflation is described by the generalization of −3α1 ln(V1 ), where we assume that inflation
is driven by the matter fields φi . The term proportional to β R fixes hT i = 21 as needed to
generate the Starobinsky potential. Since the potential is actually flat along the real T n
directions, we use the terms proportional to the βnR to fix the remaining real parts of the
moduli to the same value 3 . Hence, during inflation, we obtain ξn = 1 for n ≥ 2, and the
scalar potential forms (63) and (65) can be approximated by:

No-Scale α-Starobinsky Models with Supersymmetry Breaking

In this Section, we examine in more detail no-scale α-Starobinsky models characterized
(2,1)
by a non-compact SUSU
Kähler potential (1). As discussed in the previous Section,
(2)×U (1)
we assume that the no-scale Kähler potential is modified to include a quartic stabilization
term which fixes the VEV of the volume modulus hT i = 21 . During inflation, the imaginary
part of φ picks up a mass, so we can take hIm φi = 0, and we associate the real part of the
field φ with the inflaton. We make the following field redefinition to obtain a canonicallynormalized field:

The first term in (74) corresponds to the cosmological constant, Λ = 12λ̃1 λ̃2 M 6 . As
mentioned earlier, we expect that the vacuum energy density is modified by (negative)
contributions from phases transitions occurring after inflation. For example, for λ̃1,2 ∼
O(1), we would require a contribution of order M 6 ∼ 10−30 to cancel the term in (74)
to eventually yield a cosmological constant of order 10−120 today. Interestingly, the GUT
phase transition in a flipped SU(5) × U(1) model occurs after inflation [46] and contributes
2

2
∆V ∼ −Msusy
MGUT
∼ −(λ̃1 − λ̃2 )2 M 6 MGUT
and would indicate that perhaps λ̃1 /λ̃2 ∼
2
(MGUT /MP ) or equivalently for λ̃2 /λ̃1 .
The second term in (74) corresponds to a perturbation of the inflaton potential and
has a negligible effect on the inflationary dynamics, because it is scaled by M 4 relative to
the inflationary potential (the third term in (74)) which scales as M 2 . Therefore, at large
x ∆V adds a relatively small amount 6λ̃2 M 4 to the Starobinsky plateau value of (3/4)M 2 .
Our next goal is to extend this formalism to general cases with α 6= 1, and construct
generalized α-Starobinsky inflationary models consistent with supersymmetry breaking and
a positive cosmological constant. We follow the treatment presented in the previous Section
and, for simplicity, consider only the cases where the inflationary superpotential WI is
coupled to a Minkowski vacuum solution associated with the lower power ξ n− . Our goal
20

therefore, is to determine the superpotential which generates a Starobinsky potential for
any value of α. To this end, we parametrize the superpotential with a function f (φ) as:

It is important to note that the hypergeometric superpotential (78) is a function of a matter
field φ only, therefore it can be successfully combined with the dark energy sector WdS .
Despite its rather cumbersome form, the expression in (78) simplifies dramatically for
certain values of α. For example, for α = 1, the superpotential is simply our
 original2 WessZumino superpotential given in Eq. (71) as, in this case, m = 0 and 2 F1 32 , 0; 25 ; φ3 = 1.

Other polynomial forms arise when α = 49/9 and 9. However, for any α, the scalar potential
always reduces to the α-Starobinsky potential (80). We note that the full superpotential,
WI is a polynomial whenever 9α is an odd perfect square other than 1.
Because the potential (80) depends on α, the evolution of inflaton field and resulting
slow-roll parameters differ when α is varied. We show in Fig. 3 the slow-roll evolution of
the field x for different values of α. Once again, we assume that all models have strongly
stabilized moduli, so that we can safely treat them as single-field models of inflation. We
consider the following α-Starobinsky cases with four different values of α that give N∗ = 55:

Unified ST U Models

In this Section we apply our framework to a more general effective supergravity theory
that may emerge from string theory compactifications in the low-energy limit. We follow
the treatment presented in [39] and illustrate how to construct unified ST U inflationary
models with supersymmetry breaking and a positive cosmological constant. In Section 3.2
we introduced multi-field no-scale attractors and argued that inflation must be driven by
matter-like fields φi while moduli fields T n are responsible for supersymmetry breaking
through F -terms. This Section shows how to relate the unified no-scale formulation to
specific M/string theory models.
We begin by considering a seven-disk manifold, which can be connected to M-theory
compactified on a 7-manifold with G2 holonomy. We introduce the following Kähler potential:

coset symmetry. Within the framewhich describes a seven-disk manifold with SUU(1,1)
(1)
work (82) we consider the ST U model, which is described by the Kähler potential (5).

This expression arises in type IIB string theory and is characterized by a Z2 T× Z2 coset manifold. The three complex scalar fields in (5) are interpreted as a volume modulus T , the
axiodilaton S, and a complex structure modulus U .
We consider a specific unified ST U example, where we introduce an untwisted matter
like field φ into the Kähler potential −3 ln T + T † . Thus, our model is characterized by
the following ST U Kähler potential:

where the matter-like field φ is identified as the inflaton field, and we have introduced
quartic terms to stabilize the imaginary parts of T, S and U . It should be noted that one
can consider various ST U models, and the untwisted matter-like field φ can be also incor

where ξ1 = 2T − φ3 , ξ2 = 2U and ξ3 = 2S. At the minimum, the strongly stabilized fields T ,
U , and S acquire the vacuum expectation values hT i = hU i = hSi = 12 , while the matterlike field has hφi = 0, and the positive cosmological constant is given by Λ = 12λ̃1 λ̃2 M 6 .
In order to consider more complicated unified ST U models and connect them to
M/string theory, we rewrite the general multi-field Kähler potential form (66) in ST U

where, in addition to the quartic stabilization terms in both real and imaginary directions
for the complex fields T n , U a and S, we have also introduced three classes of matter-like
fields φnT , φaU and φS , which are associated with prospective inflaton fields. It is important
to note that one can always discard irrelevant matter-like fields in the Kähler potential (85)
and consider various ST U model combinations, but for clarity we have provided the complete form. The quartic stabilization terms in Kähler potential (85), ensure that the moduli
acquire vacuum expectation values hT n i = hU a i = hSi = 21 .
In this scenario, inflation can be driven by up to 7 different matter-like fields, and the
principles discussed in Section 3.2 can be applied. As in [39], we consider a specific example
where we impose the following conditions on the form (83) of the Kähler potential:
T n = U a = S = T,

and

φnT = φaU = φS = φ,

(86)

and for clarity we exclude quartic stabilization terms. Comparing with the generic Kähler
(2,1)
potential that parametrizes an SUSU
coset manifold (1), we have

i.e., we have the relation 3 α = 7. Alternatively, if we set a subset of the complex scalar
fields T n , U a and S equal to T and the associated matter-like fields φnT , φaU and φs equal
24

to φ, we can remove the remaining trivial complex fields from the Lagrangian by setting
them equal to a constant, and obtain the following curvature parameter values 4 :
3α = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} .

(88)

Previously, we have argued that for unified no-scale models inflation must be driven by a
matter-like field φ. Therefore, if we consider the α-Starobinsky inflationary model, which
is characterized by Kähler potential (1) and superpotential (78), with curvature parameter
values (88) and a nominal choice of e-foldings N∗ = 55, we obtain the following cosmological

Summary

Intriguingly, observations of the CMB are highly consistent with the original Starobinsky
model of inflation, whereas many other models proposed subsequently have fallen by the
wayside. The range of ns preferred by the data is highly consistent with the Starobinsky
prediction ns = 1 − 2/N∗ , where N∗ ∼ 50 to 60 is the number of e-folds of inflation, and the
current upper limit on r ∼ 0.06 is also consistent with the Starobinsky prediction ∼ 0.003,
albeit with considerable leeway. One of our reasons for being intrigued by the Starobinsky
model is that its predictions are shared by simple models based on no-scale supergravity
(1), as was first discussed in [17] for the case α = 1. As we have emphasized there and
in this paper, some form of no-scale supergravity emerges naturally as the effective lowenergy theory derived in compactified string models, thus offering a specific bridge between
cosmological observables and string theory.
As was first emphasized in [18], one may consider generalizations of the original model
(1) with α 6= 1, depending on the (combination of) compactification modulus field(s)
providing the inflaton, yielding the predictions (2) for ns and r. Similar models were

discussed from a more general point of view in [27, 33–39], where they were dubbed αattractors. The predictions of such models are compatible with the CMB data for a large
range of possible values of α, as seen in Fig. 2. In this connection, we are encouraged by the
recent approval of the LiteBIRD space mission, which is projected to be able to measure r
to an accuracy of ±0.001, sufficient to measure α with interesting precision, and thereby
provide an entrée into the phenomenology of string compactification.
The main purpose of this paper has been to develop a framework for this prospective
(2,1)
phenomenology that extends beyond the scope of Kähler manifolds with the SUSU
(2)×U (1)
coset structure considered previously [20, 21]. In [20] we gave a general classification of
superpotentials for such manifolds that lead to Starobinsky-like inflation when α = 1,
discussing the relations between them provided by the underlying no-scale structure. Then,
in [21] we showed how such Starobinsky-like predictions for the CMB observables could be
combined in a unified framework with modulus fixing, supersymmetry breaking and a small
cosmological constant compatible with the current density of dark energy. In this paper
we have extended these earlier constructions in two main directions: to inflationary models
(N,1)
based on generalized no-scale structures with SUSU
coset structures and to models
(N )×U (1)
26

with different values of α and hence r, as may occur if the inflaton corresponds to only
a subset of the complex Kähler moduli, or if complex structure moduli also help drive
(2,1)
inflation. As in the previous SUSU
case, key building blocks in these generalizations
(2)×U (1)
are played by minimal superpotentials that yield Minkowski vacua and can, in pairs, yield
either de Sitter or anti de Sitter vacuum states.
We plan to return in a forthcoming paper to more detailed phenomenological investigations of such generalized α-no-scale models, with a view to kickstarting the exploration
of cosmological string phenomenology that will be opened up by LiteBIRD and other CMB
experiments. We have emphasized the important role that could be played by measurements of r in constraining the geometry of the the underlying no-scale Kähler manifold
but, before closing, we stress also the importance of measurements of the scalar tilt, ns .
As seen in (1), this is sensitive to the number of e-folds of inflation, N∗ , and hence to the
post-inflationary history of the Universe. In particular, it is sensitive to the amount of
post-inflationary reheating, and hence to the coupling of the inflaton to lighter degrees of
freedom. Thus, it complements the measurement of r by being sensitive to the superpotential of the inflationary model. Combining the constraints on r and ns could provide unique
insights into the underlying string compactification.
