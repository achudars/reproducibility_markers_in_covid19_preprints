Abstract

This paper reports on the physical and temperature-dependent electrical characterizations of the
oxide/semiconductor interface in MOS capacitors with a SiO2 layer deposited on 4H-SiC using
dichlorosilane and nitrogen-based vapor precursors. The capacitors, subjected to a standard post
deposition annealing process in N2O, exhibited an interface state density Dit ≈ 9.0×1011cm-2eV-1
below the conduction band edge. At room temperature, a barrier height (conduction band offset) of
2.8 eV was observed, along with the presence of negative charges in the insulator. The SiO2
insulating properties were evaluated by studying the experimental temperature-dependence of the
gate current. In particular, the temperature-dependent electrical measurements showed a negative
temperature coefficient of the Fowler-Nordheim electron barrier height (dΦB/dT = − 0.98 meV/°C),
which was very close to the expected value for an ideal SiO2/4H-SiC system and much lower
compared to the values reported for thermally grown SiO2. This smaller dependence of ΦB on the
temperature and the increase of the current level with temperature in the transcharacteristics
measured in the relative fabricated MOSFETs represents a clear advantage of our deposited SiO2 for
the operation of MOSFET devices at high temperatures.

Keywords: 4H-SiC, MOS-capacitors, deposited oxide, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.

1. Introduction
Thanks to its exceptional physical properties, 4H-SiC is an excellent wide band gap (WBG)
semiconductor for high power electronics applications [1]. In particular, power switches based on
4H-SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (4H-SiC MOSFETs) can be used in
energy conversion systems for automotive and renewable energies, providing a significant
improvement in terms of energy efficiency. Clearly, studying the properties of the SiO2/4H-SiC
interfaces (interface state density Dit, charge trapping mechanisms, conduction mechanisms through
the insulator, etc.) is particularly important, as this system represents the core of the MOSFET
device. In fact, it is well known that a high Dit or the presence of near-interface-traps (NITs) can be
detrimental both for the channel mobility and for the threshold voltage stability of the devices [2,3].
In addition, reliability issues play a critical role for 4H-SiC MOSFETs, where the reduced band
offset can induce leakage current enhancement and the consequent early degradation of the gate
insulator at high electric fields. In this context, the full understanding of the mechanisms governing
the carrier transport through the gate oxides and the dielectric degradation is still missing and
currently under debate.[4]
In literature, SiO2-gate oxide in 4H-SiC MOSFETs could be formed either by thermal oxidation
[5] or by the deposition from vapor phase techniques at moderate temperatures (e.g., TEOS at
400°C [6]). In practice, post oxidation annealing (POA) or post deposition annealing (PDA)
treatments are required to reduce the Dit and to improve the MOSFETs channel mobility. In the case
of thermally grown oxides, some authors reported the presence of a disordered C-rich interfacial
layer [7,8,9], detected even after nitridation annealing in NO [10], which can penalize also the
MOS-stack reliability. In particular, the conduction band offset between SiO2/4H-SiC system, lower
compared to the SiO2/Si system, deserves particular attention because the enhanced leakage current
can induce the early wear out of the insulating layer and the premature power device failure.
Recently, it has been demonstrated the presence of active defects in thermally grown oxides onto n-

type 4H-SiC that enhance the current conduction through the insulator in MOS capacitor [11]. The
Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission is believed to be responsible for this current enhancement with respect
to the theoretical bottom limit of the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. Specifically, in order to avoid the
formation of C-related defects, which causes an increase of the gate current in thermal oxides, the
use of deposited oxides has been explored [12,13,14,15].
Hence, studying the temperature dependence of the Fowler–Nordheim current in 4H-SiC MOS
systems is of considerable interest because of the practical implications in the evaluation of the
high-field and high-temperature performance of both MOSFETs and Insulated-Gate-BipolarTransistors (IGBT’s) [16].
In this work, a temperature dependent electrical characterization of 4H-SiC MOS capacitors, with
the oxide layer deposited at high temperature (800°C) from dichlorosilane and nitrogen-based
precursors and subjected to PDA in N2O, is presented. Using the standard Fowler-Nordheim (FN)
tunneling formulation the electron barrier height could be determined from room temperature up to
150°C. In particular, the temperature coefficient of the FN electron barrier height ( dΦ B dT vs T)
was considered to evaluate the quality of the deposited oxide with respect to the ideal SiO2/4H-SiC
system. The results showed a nearly-ideal thermal behavior of our gate oxide, as the temperature
coefficient of the FN barrier (− 0.98 meV/°C) was very close to the ideal one and much lower
compared to that reported for thermally grown SiO2 layers.

2. Experimental Details

The SiO2 layer was deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on a n-type
4H-SiC epitaxial sample with doping level of ND=1×1016 cm-3. The deposition process of SiO2 was
carried out at a temperature of about 800 °C, using dichlorosilane SiH2Cl2, (DCS) and N2O as
gaseous precursors. After the deposition of the SiO2-layer, the sample was subjected to a standard
post-deposition annealing (PDA) treatment in N2O ambient at 1150°C for 4 hours [17].

Then, MOS capacitors were fabricated using a heavily doped n-type poly-Si as gate electrode and
Nickel as back contact. Firstly, physical analysis of the oxide by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) were performed on blanket samples. Then,
electrical capacitance-voltage (C-V), conductance-voltage (Gp/ω-V) and current-voltage (I-V)
measurements were performed on the MOS capacitors by a Cascade Summit 12000M probe station.
These measurements were carried out from room temperature up to 150°C.

3. Results and Discussion
First of all, cross section TEM analysis of the deposited oxide subjected to PDA has been carried
out. As can be seen in Fig. 1a, the deposited SiO2 is conformal to the 4H-SiC substrate showing a
total thickness of about 49 nm.
Fig. 1b reports the SIMS profile of Silicon, Carbon, Oxygen and Nitrogen in the
oxide/semiconductor interfacial region. The N-concentration, originated from the PDA treatment in
N2O, has been extrapolated directly from the SIMS analysis and results in the order of 1021
atoms/cm3. As matter of fact, the N concentration is very focused at that interface as generally the

layer with N atoms segregating at the SiO2/SiC interface. Thus, it is the areal density related to the
N-peak that becomes an interesting parameter. From a mathematical integration of the volumetric
density over a spatial region at the interface related to the N-peak, we obtain a N-areal density of
about 2×1014 atoms/cm2.
It is worth noting that the C-profile decreases steeply towards the SiO2. From this analysis, no
significant C accumulation is detected at the interface. However, it cannot be ruled out that small
amount of C (below the detection limit) is present inside the SiO2 as a consequence of the reoxidation due to PDA.
The electrical characterization has been carried out starting with a set of temperature dependent
C-V measurements, acquired on capacitors having an area of 0.0225 cm2. The temperature
dependence has been evaluated in order to monitor any possible change of the flat band voltage
(VFB) and to determine with high accuracy the effective charge density. Fig.2a shows the C-V
curves measured at different temperatures from 25°C up to 150°C. At room temperature, the
experimental VFB is positively shifted with respect to the ideal C-V value due to the presence of an
effective negative charge in the MOS system. Quantitatively, an experimental VFB = -0.26 V has
been determined, which corresponds to an effective negative charge density of Qeff = 2.2×1011 cm-2
obtained from the comparison with the ideal VFB value (VFB= -0.72 V). Moreover, as can be seen in
Fig. 2a, the C-V curves are quite stable with the temperature and, as reported in Fig. 2b, the flat
band voltage exhibits only a variation of -0.8mV/°C (Fig.2b) with increasing the temperature (VFB =
-0.36 eV at 150°C).

The density of interface states Dit was determined by means of the conductance method from
Gp/ω vs frequency. Fig.3 displays the values of Dit from the edge of the conduction band EC. The

value of Dit ≈ 9.0×1011cm-2eV-1, obtained at 0.2 eV from EC, is comparable to those typically
measured in 4H-SiC MOS capacitors employing thermally grown oxides and subjected to the same
post oxidation annealing (POA) (Dit = 0.8-1.8×1012cm-2eV-1) [18,19,20]. The presence of a low
density of fixed charges as well as the Dit value comparable to thermal growth process, indicate that
the oxide properties are ultimately determined by the annealing treatments (POA or PDA) in N2O.
The insulating properties were also monitored by I-V analysis, with I-V characteristics measured
from room temperature up to 150°C in the MOS capacitor.

where J is the current density, Eox is the electric field across the oxide, mSiC and mox are the effective
electron masses in the SiC substrate and in the insulator respectively, q is the electron charge, h is
the Plank constant and ΦB is the tunnelling barrier height for electrons [21]. By the fits in the linear
region of the “FN plots” ln(J/Eox2) vs 1/Eox shown in Fig. 4, it was possible to determine the values
of ΦB for electrons as a function of the temperature (Fig. 5). It has to be emphasized that the current
measurements are performed varying the gate bias (VG). However, we have considered the total
electric field across the insulator, taking into account also the T-dependence of the VFB. This can be
written as:

contributions.
As shown in Fig. 5 the Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling well describes the current conduction
mechanisms of the system. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the ideal FN tunneling possesses a
weak temperature dependence, related to the shrinking of the 4H-SiC and SiO2 band gaps with
increasing temperature [22]. FN tunneling is commonly achieved in SiO2/Si system using thermally
grown oxide layers. On the other hand, thermally grown oxide layers onto 4H-SiC contain residual
carbon atom content that may affect the insulating properties of the gate oxide. In particular,
Sometani et al. [11] demonstrated that thermally grown SiO2 at 1200°C onto 4H-SiC shows a
Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission ruling the conduction through the gate oxide in MOS capacitors at

temperature above 25°C. More recently, P. Samanta and K. C. Mandal [22] compared the
experimental temperature dependence of the electron barrier height, measured in MOS capacitors
having a layer of SiO2 thermally grown at 1100°C onto 4H-SiC, with the theoretical value of the

dΦ B dT for the ideal FN tunneling, and observed a significant difference. In particular, the
experimental slope (-7.6meV/°C) is one order of magnitude higher than the theoretical one.

Fig. 5 shows how both our experimental results, literature data and the ideal values of the
electron barrier height ΦB vary with a temperature increasing temperature from -25°C up to 250°C.
The ideal FN shows a barrier height ΦB = 2.7 eV that decreases with a slope of the dΦ B dT = −
0.7meV/°C [22] with increasing temperature, essentially due to the temperature related variation of
both the SiO2 and 4H-SiC band offset and the Fermi level. On the other hand, an experimental
barrier height of ΦB = 2.8 eV was extracted at room temperature, i.e., slightly larger of the ideal
value expected for SiO2/4H-SiC interface. This result is consistent with the effective negative
charge detected with the C-V curves in Fig. 2a. Furthermore, the indication of the good quality of
the deposited oxide is obtained considering that the experimental slope of the dΦ B dT is −

0.98meV/°C is only slightly larger than the ideal value of − 0.7meV/°C. Indeed, this discrepancy is
almost negligible considering a possible error of 5% in the determination of the barrier height.
In order to exclude the occurrence of a PF emission on our samples, the temperature and electric
field dependence of PF emission has been considered according to the following PF formalism
[23,24]:

and where ϕt is the barrier height for electron emission from the trap states, εSiO2 is the relative
dielectric permittivity at high frequency of the gate insulator (SiO2), T is absolute temperature, ε0 is
the permittivity of free space, and k is Boltzmann’s constant. It is known that the PF also owns an
exponential relationship with the electron emission barrier height. However, the validity of the PF
emission fitting can be proven looking at the temperature dependence of the linear coefficient m(T)
obtained from the lineal fit of the PF plots ln(J/Eox) as a function of Eox0.5. Moreover, in the PF
formalism the linear coefficient m(T) can be expressed as a linear function of T-1 with the slope
depending on the relative insulator permittivity at high frequency εSiO2. If a pure PF emission occurs
the linear fit of the m(T) vs T-1 should give the ideal εSiO2=3.9 value. However, in the present case
the application of the mathematical procedure just described gives a misleading value of εSiO2=80.
This last result pointed out that the mathematic of the PF emission has no physical meaning to
describe our experimental data. Thus, this result suggests that the correct way to describe the
experimental data is the FN formalism.
Fig. 5 shows also the dΦ B dT behavior taken from literature data [11,22] for thermally grown
oxides that decreases with a slope up to ten times larger than the ideal FN value. Clearly, the
behavior of the temperature coefficient of the barrier height can depend on the oxide processing. In
fact, Sometani et al. [11] demonstrated the occurrence of an ideal FN behavior at low temperatures,
i.e., from -150°C up to room temperature. Above room temperature, the gate oxide conduction was
dominated by PF emission for thermally grown oxides and then the FN barrier was not estimated

[11]. On the other hand, early study from A. K. Agarwal et al. [16] reported a dΦ B dT of about −
2.56 meV/°C for a thermally grown oxide subjected to a POA in Ar. As mentioned before, this
behavior has been explained with the occurrence of a PF emission [22], likely due to the presence of
C-related defects in the insulator induced during the SiO2 thermal growth.
In order to preliminarily prove that it is potentially advantageous for use in MOSFETs at high
temperature, we have employed deposited oxide on the fabrication of lateral test MOSFETs devices.
Fig. 6 shows the transcharacteristics (ID-VG) of a lateral MOSFET having L=40μm and W=16μm
measured at room temperature and at 200°C, respectively. As can be seen, the threshold voltage
shifts toward smaller gate bias values increasing temperature but the enhanced mode operation of
the transistor is preserved. Furthermore, the drain current increases with the increasing temperature
demonstrating the improvements at high temperature in terms of total on resistance.

4. Summary
In this paper, we have investigated the physical and temperature dependent electrical properties
of SiO2/4H-SiC system in MOS capacitors, with the oxide deposited by a high temperature (800°C)
CVD process starting from a DCS precursor and subjected to PDA in N2O. The temperature

dependent electrical investigation of the MOS capacitors demonstrates the good quality of the
oxide, presenting low density of fixed charges, as well as a value of Dit comparable to our standard
thermally grown oxides. The room temperature electron barrier height of 2.8 eV is close to the value
expected for an ideal Fowler-Nordheim tunneling occurring between the SiO2/4H-SiC conduction
band. Furthermore, nearly ideal Fowler-Nordheim tunneling has been proved looking at the
temperature coefficient of the electron barrier height ( dΦ B dT ), which resulted noticeably
improved with respect to thermally grown oxides.
