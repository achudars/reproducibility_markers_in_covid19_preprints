Abstract
Given an observable and its operator product expansion (OPE), we present expressions that carefully disentangle truncated sums of the perturbative series in powers of α from the non-perturbative
(NP) corrections. This splitting is done with NP power accuracy. Analytic control of the splitting
is achieved and the organization of the different terms is done along an super/hyper-asymptotic
expansion. As a test we apply the methods to the static potential in the large β0 approximation.
We see the superasymptotic and hyperasymptotic structure of the observable in full glory.

INTRODUCTION

Non-perturbative (NP) effects are dominant for QCD phenomena with characteristic
energy of O(ΛQCD ). Consequently, the absence of analytic tools for dealing with NP effects
in QCD makes impossible to produce quantitative semi-analytic predictions in terms of ΛQCD
and renormalized quark masses for most low energy observables.
On the other hand, there are observables for which their perturbative expansions in powers of α are reasonable approximations. This typically happens when there is a large scale,
generically referred as Q ( ΛQCD ), in the process. In principle, it is then possible to perform perturbative calculations up to any finite order in α. Nevertheless, such perturbative
expansions are expected to be asymptotic and divergent. Such divergent behavior is not
arbitrary. Besides the perturbative series in powers of α, one also expects the observable to
depend on, non-analytic, NP, functions of order e

∼ (ΛQCD /Q)A . These NP effects

and the perturbative series in powers of α are not independent of each other. Indeed the
former determines the late-term behavior of the later. Leaving aside instantons, that we will
neglect in what follows (as they yield smaller NP corrections than those we consider in this
paper), such relation can be quantified using the operator product expansion (OPE) of the
observable for large Q. The allowed operators determine the allowed corrections in powers
of ΛQCD (up to logarithms), and, therefore, the large order behavior of the perturbative expansion, since the latter can be related with singularities in the Borel plane (located in the
positive real axis), which mix with the NP corrections. To these singularities (and the associated asymptotic perturbative expansion) we generically refer to as infrared renormalons
[1].
On a more general scenario one can consider more than one large scale: Q1  Q2 
ΛQCD . Then the use of the OPE and the factorization between the different scales makes
the perturbative expansions associated with each scale to be asymptotic. In some cases
one has renormalon singularities associated with the scales Q1 and Q2 that cancel among
themselves. This is indeed the case for the leading renormalon singularity of the pole mass
and the static potential, as first found in [2], and later in [3, 4]. We name these renormalon
singularities spurious.
So, in general, we want to:

2. Avoid spurious renormalon problems.
In this paper we focus on 1), though our results will be relevant for 2) too.
Besides its intrinsic theoretical interest, the asymptotic behavior of perturbative expansions in QCD is starting to be seen in a series of observables, in particular, in heavy quark
physics. In this case, in order to handle the renormalon problem associated with the pole
mass, different threshold masses have been introduced [4–9]. Some of these threshold masses
introduce (explicitly or implicitly) a scale νf that acts as an infrared cutoff. Such infrared
cutoff kills the renormalon behavior of the perturbative series producing a convergent perturbative series and introducing a linear power-like dependence in νf . In practice these
threshold masses work quite well. The error associated to the fact that we have this linear
cutoff is typically small (see, for instance, [10–12]). Still, it is not optimal conceptually1 .
Other of these threshold masses use approximate expressions for the Borel transform of the
pole mass that partially incorporate the renormalon singularities in the Borel plane. The
inverse of the Borel transform (which we will name Borel sum or Borel integral in the following) is then ill defined. This requires using some prescription to regulate the Borel integral.
In this last case the perturbative series is typically abandoned and one directly works with
the Borel integral expression. In this approach it is not quantified what is the error made
by using (the unavoidably) approximated expressions for the Borel transform.
This discussion leads us to consider an alternative method that is also often used to
tame the asymptotic behavior of the perturbative series: truncating the perturbative sum
at the minimal term. In mathematical literature, such approximation is often named the
superasymptotic approximation of the original function (see [13]), which is a name we will also
use in the following. This procedure has long since been used (see [14], or [15], for references),
mainly in the context of solutions to one-dimensional differential equations. Nevertheless, in
that context, renormalons do not show up, nor it does the issue of scheme/scale dependence.
In the context of four dimensional quantum gauge field theories, truncation of the perturbative sum in different formulations or using approximated expressions for the Borel integrals
has also been considered since the early days of OPE/renormalon analyses to determine ob1

In the same way that there is nothing conceptually wrong in using cutoff regularization in perturbative
computations, but regularizations that kill spurious power-like divergences, like dimensional regularization,
and preserve more symmetries are much more convenient.

servables with NP accuracy (see for instance, [15–22]). However, it was not possible to
make quantitative analyses beyond the large-β0 approximation, since the existing perturbative series were only known to low orders. More recently, perturbative expansions have
been obtained to high enough orders for some observables in the lattice scheme [23–26].
This has allowed us to quantitatively use perturbative sums truncated at the minimal term
and successfully determine the gluon condensate and Λ̄ in the quenched approximation [27].
This success motivates us to try to improve this approach, and to revisit with it observables
already computed in the MS scheme, even if only few coefficients are known, since in the
MS scheme (and in particular in heavy quark physics) renormalon dominance shows up at
relatively low orders.
Whereas, by construction, the superasymptotic approximation does not explicitly introduce the factorization scale νf , the dependence on the renormalization scale ν remains to
be assessed. Therefore, to push this method forward we need to get a quantitative understanding of the error on the truncation of the sum and of its remaining scheme and scale
dependence. Similarly, the NP power corrections are potentially dependent on how the divergent perturbative series is regulated and on the renormalization scheme/scale used to
define the strong coupling: αX (µ). A major point of this paper is to be able to control
(in an analytic way) the dependence of the power corrections in this generalized scheme
dependence. We will only then be able to add NP power corrections to the pertubative
series in a systematic way, since the mixing between the perturbative series and the leading
NP terms (or between the perturbative series associated to the scales Q1 and Q2 ) makes
impossible to determine them independently. An unambiguous definition of the NP power
corrections requires defining the perturbative series with power accuracy. Such combined
expansion of perturbative series and NP terms will be called hyperasymptotic expansion as
in [13]. Organizing the computation in this way allows us to precisely state the parametric
accuracy of the result at each step.
The mixing between perturbative and NP effects may hinder estimating the real size of
the NP effects. This happens when using threshold masses. In this case the problem is
not severe. A more extreme example of this problem appears in lattice regularization. The
gluon condensate is, up to a factor, the expectation value of the plaquette:

where p0 = 4π/3. For β = 3/(2πα) = 6.65 we have hG2 ilatt ∼ 3.3 × 104 r0−4 , whereas the NP
gluon condensate is ∼ 3.2 r0−4 [27]. We see that the perturbative contribution overwhelms
the NP contribution by orders of magnitude. Therefore, it is convenient to devise schemes
where one has extracted as much information as possible from perturbation theory in such
a way that the remaining NP object has a minimal mixing with perturbation theory. This
scheme would provide a natural place to estimate the real size of the NP corrections without
the distortion due to perturbative effects. We believe that in this scheme one could get a
better understanding of the real structure (size) of the NP effects. This could be important,
once the precision increases and to set a standard for the future.
It is also our aim to relate the hyperasymptotic expansion with the previously mentioned
methods used to handle the pole mass renormalon. This will allow us to parametrically
quantify the error those methods have, in particular those using approximate expressions
for the Borel transform.
Finally, it is also worth mentioning that truncating the perturbative series at the minimal
term can be motivated in the context of factorization of scales and effective field theories,
where one wants to factor out the physics associated to Q from the physics associated with
ΛQCD . The point is that in n-loop diagrams, new scales are effectively generated. These
n

scales are proportional to Q, but are modulated by small factors ∼ e− k , where k is an
integer. The dominant contribution to the n-loop diagram is not then due to Q but to
Qe

, where kmin is the smallest possible k for the process at hand. For the case of the

pole mass kmin = 1 and Q = m. In this case, for small n, we still have that me−n  ΛQCD .

The structure of the paper will be as follows. In Sec. II we discuss the general case when
there are no ultraviolet renormalons. In Sec. III we discuss the QCD static potential in
the large β0 approximation. We use this quantity as a toy-model NP observable to test our
methods. The inclusion of ultraviolet renormalons and real QCD examples will be discussed
in followup papers.

For observables that live in the Euclidean (like the Adler function or the plaquette), Od
generically represents a local operator, but not necessarily so if the OPE is applied to
EFTs in the Minkowski (as it could be the case for the B meson mass). In any case, the
expectation values hOd i, are of order ΛdQCD (up to some anomalous dimension). On the
other hand S(αX (Q)) can be computed as a Taylor expansion in powers of αX (Q). This
series is assumed to be asymptotic. Up to some anomalous dimension, CO,d (αX (Q)) can
also be computed as a Taylor expansion in powers of αX (Q) and the generated series is also
assumed to be asymptotic (we will not explicitly ellaborate much on this fact though, since
this leads us to consider subleading corrections in the OPE expansion, which can be handled
in an analogous way). Then, the observable is often represented in the following way:

and so on. Obviously, the three equalities in Eq. (3) are symbolic representations of the
observable, as the perturbative series are asymptotic. We need to define first the perturbative
series with ΛQCD power accuracy. This definition of the perturbative series will, in turn,
define unambiguously the NP power correction. In realistic cases, the only information that
we will have of the OPE of the observable will be:
1. The exact knowledge of the coefficients pn up to n = N , where N  1 is large enough
such that pn is well approximated by its asymptotic behavior2 ;
2. The knowledge of the structure of the leading NP power corrections: values of d, γ
(d)

and the very first few terms of pn ;
3. The knowledge of the asymptotic behavior of pn (which relies on the previous item
and demanding consistency to the OPE):

dictated by the renormalization

group invariance. In realistic cases, only to some order.
Therefore, we will devise definition methods that only use this information. This naturally
leads us to consider perturbative series truncated at the minimal term N ∗ (or close by):

Note that N ∗ depends on µ and on the renormalization scheme X used to define the strong
coupling constant: αX (µ).
Therefore, we define

(8)

Otherwise the perturbative expression is not accurate enough (in principle) to be sensitive to NP corrections and it does not make much sense the consideration of NP power corrections, which is the aim of this
paper.

After truncating, ST (Q) depends on small variations of N around N ∗ , on µ, and on the
scheme X (in this paper we will consider perturbative expansions either in the lattice or in
the MS scheme but the expressions are valid for general renormalization schemes). Overall,
we generically label all the summation scheme dependence by T . The ambiguity (freedom)
of the truncated perturbative series is “of-the-order” of the power correction. By this we
mean that small variations in N around N ∗ are of O(e

−d β

2π

). We also assume that the

truncated sum ST for N ∼ N ∗ to be asymptotic to the full result in the following way

ΛQCD

) − ST (Q) = O(e

2π
0 αX (µ)

),

(9)

where d is the dimension of the leading NP term of the OPE.
As the observable is summation scheme independent, the T -scheme dependence of ST (Q)
should cancel with the scheme dependence of the NP power corrections. We would like
to determine Eq. (9) with higher precision. As we have mentioned, one can get right the
dimension d of the NP power correction by approaching N to N ∗ . It is more complicated to
fix the overall coefficient (and its structure in powers of α and ln α) that modulates the NP
power correction. This will heavily depend on the freedom in truncating the perturbative
series. It also needs some extra information in the relation between the perturbative series
and the observable.
In order to quantify this difference, we first search for generalized summation schemes of
the perturbative sum that are T -scheme independent, i.e. that they are independent of µ,
X and N . The Borel integral of the Borel transform is a natural candidate. In our case
the inverse of the Borel transform needs regularization, as it has singularities in the real
axis at positive values of the integration variable. Here we take the principal value (PV)
prescription of the perturbative expansion:

where u ≡ β0 t/(4π). For this and related equations we collect a useful set of equalities in
Appendix A.
Now, our first task is to show that SPV is indeed T -scheme independent.
In the large β0 approximation the PV Borel integral can be shown to be factorization-scale
and scheme independent (actually in the large β0 approximation both things are the same)
[28]. Beyond the large β0 approximation things are more complicated. Nevertheless, we
can still show the factorization and scheme independence of SPV under some assumptions.
We first consider the renormalization scale dependence. We restrict the discussion to the
inclusion of β1 to the running of α. Then, renormalization scale independence gives the
following relation between coefficients [28]:

These are total derivatives. The behavior of gi (u) for small u is gi (u) ∼ uα with α > 0. For
large u, gi (u) ∼ e−u/α h(u), where h(u) does not grow exponentially. Therefore, g(0) = 0 and
g(∞) = 0, proving the renormalization scale independence of SPV . The inclusion of higher
order terms seems to produce also total derivatives that vanish. Note that our conclusion
disagrees with [28].
We now turn to the scheme dependence. Given the perturbative series in a given scheme:

Note also that

Overall we get

For simplification one could work in schemes that make higher order terms (the dots) to vanish. Then, making a similar computation to the one we did to get the scale dependence, we

which vanish:

(24)

Therefore, SPV is T -scheme independent.
We do not enter in this paper into global definitions of the Borel integral of the observable itself, which may not exist [1]. For the purposes of this paper, it is enough that we
can define the Borel transform of the perturbative series and its Borel sum (with the PV
prescription). We then assume that difference between the Borel sum regulated using the
PV prescription and the complete NP result obtained from full QCD can be absorbed in the
NP terms of the OPE. An analytic proof (of disproof) of that is tantamount to given a NP
proof of the OPE in QCD, which is, at present, beyond reach. Since we assume that such
generalized resummation scheme preserves the structure of the NP OPE, the difference with
the observable has to exactly scale as the NP corrections of the OPE:

Note also that the exponent γ and the O(αX (Q)) can be determined by RG analyses. In
some cases RG analysis says that there is no O(αX (Q)) corrections (the Wilson coefficient
is identically 1). This indeed would be the case of the B-meson mass.
SPV has the handicap, though, that it needs the full analytic structure of the Borel
transform in the Borel plane, i.e. it requires the knowledge of the perturbative series to all
orders. This can make them unpractical3 . Remarkably enough, however, this problem can
3

In the resolution of one-dimensional differential equations this cannot be much of a problem, since it is
possible to compute perturbation series to very high orders, and one has good analytic control on the NP

12

be bypassed by relating SPV with truncated versions of the perturbative series. This is the
strategy we follow: devising truncated sums that we can relate with the PV result. This
allows us to control the scheme dependence and error of using ST . Quite remarkably, this
approach also allows us to quantify the error of using approximate expressions for SPV , since
we do not know the complete perturbative series.
For fixed µ, the N → ∞ limit of ST (Q) diverges, since the perturbative series is divergent.
Therefore, if we want to keep µ finite, we have to keep N finite as well. Alternatively, if
we want to take N → ∞, then we should as well send µ → ∞. Therefore, we explore two
possibilities. One is to take µ ∼ Q in N ∼ N ∗ , the other is to take µ → ∞ (correlated with
N ∼ N ∗ → ∞):
1) N and µ ∼ Q large but finite:
N = NP (α) ≡ d

2) N → ∞ and µ → ∞ in a correlated way. We consider two options:

Note that with this method we do not expect a bad behavior when we take c → 0: The
result is smooth, unlike what will happen with method 2B). Remarkable enough, this result
quantifies the error of determinations of NP corrections obtained by truncating the sum
p
at (or around) the minimal term, which is of O( α(µ)ΛdQCD ) irrespective of the scale and
scheme (in particular this applies to the analysis in [27]). We now can do better, as we
now can compute these subleading terms that before went into the error. Therefore, we can
increase the precision with which the genuine NP term can be determined.
If the precision of the computation is high enough one may consider going beyond the
leading power accuracy and include the first correction to the above equations in the hyper-

renormalon and Ω0 can be easily deduced from Eq. (37) adapting dimension and anomalous
dimension to the next renormalon .
The truncated sum SP (Q; µ) depends on µ but not SPV . This has the important consequence that we can determine the µ dependence of SP (Q; µ) with ΛQCD power accuracy,
and also to control the scheme dependence. We obtain

We will typically take µ = kQ, where k is a constant of order 1 to avoid large factors.
Note also that the Taylor expansion in powers of α of the last term in Eq. (48) starts at
n = NP +1. This effectively transform this term in a NP power correction. Moreover, the fact
that the leading renormalon is subtracted from the perturbative series expansions further
suppress this contribution. A naive estimate can be obtained by saturating the coefficients
by the next renormalon. For the case of the static potential, the next renormalon is located
at u = 3/2. This produces that the series roughly scales as

which is obviously subleading, but still more important than the next NP correction. We
will visualize the size of the different terms of the hyperasymptotic expansion in more detail
in Sec. III B for the case of the static potential in the large β0 approximation.
The correction associated with an analytic function in the whole complex Borel plane

(of order αN ∼ e−#N ln(N ) ) is smaller than any NP correction (of order e−# N , where #0
is finite and bigger the further away the renormalon singularity is from the origin). Still,
one can also worry about the role played by the logs generated in the perturbative computation: ln(µ/Q) . Assuming they are large, the leading contribution to the order αN is
of O(αN lnN (µ/Q)). Since it is still 1/N ! suppressed compared with the renormalon contributions, it can be written as e−#N ln(N/(µ/Q)) . Obviously if k is made parametrically big
it could jeopardize the hierarchy of the corrections that we have here. Therefore, we will
always keep k parametrically of O(1).
We now illustrate the above general discussion using the particular case of the heavy
quark mass (we neglect ultraviolet renormalons). We then have mPV = m̄[1 + SP (m̄; µ) +
Ωm (µ) + · · · ], where m̄ ≡ mMS (mMS ), we set d = 1, and also set the Wilson coefficient of
the nonperturbative correction to 1 [30] in SP and Ωm .
We now compare our analysis with existing threshold masses. We focus on the RS mass
[6] and relatives4 . The RS mass is defined in the following way:

where one typically takes N = Nmax ≡ the maximal number of coefficients of the perturbative expansion that are known exactly (we assume that Nmax is not that high that we
have to worry about subleading renormalon). In order to lessen the νf scale dependence,

Conceptually they are equivalent to the kinetic [5] or PS mass [4], as they have an explicit cut-off as well.
These other schemes are different at low orders but they share the same asymptotic behavior.

Nevertheless, we can not increase n arbitrarily, otherwise the renormalon is not canceled.
Moreover, the value of n for which there is no cancellation of the renormalon will depend
on µ. Therefore, when including higher orders one should do it with care once approaching
to the minimal term. Another issue is the νf dependence. To connect with the approach
(n)

(as)

used in this paper we should take νf = µ. Note that then rsRS (µ) = rs (µ) − rs (µ). In
the original applications of the RS schemes this could be a problem, since the natural scale
in the pole mass is different from the natural scale in the static potential5 . To connect with
the approach used in this paper, we control the scale dependence by fixing n = N = NP (µ).
This smoothly connect the RS schemes with the schemes where the series is truncated at
the minimal term. One can then add Ωm and higher orders terms in the hyperasymptotic
expansion of mPV .
We now consider the threshold mass named mBR , defined in [7] (see also [32]). The author
directly works with the Borel transform and then regulate the Borel integral using the PV
prescription. The complete expression of the Borel transform is not known. Therefore, in
practice, an approximated expression is used that agrees with the known terms of the pole
mass perturbative expansion till N = Nmax = 2 (the known coefficients at that time) and
incorporates the leading singularity in the Borel plane. The author also makes a conformal
mapping of the Borel transform. The µ dependence of mBR was usually fixed to µ = m,
except in [33]. To make a quantitative comparison with our analysis, we leave aside the
conformal mapping and make explicit the µ scale dependence in mBR . The key point then
is the comparison of N (= 2) with NP . If N < NP (µ) there is power-like µ dependence that

If the scales are widely separated, this problem could be overcome using the resummation of logarithms
of νf , as first worked out in [31].

Note that this produces an strong (linear) renormalization scale dependence (rn

for instance [34]), since one includes orders in perturbation theory beyond those presently

P

Overall, the only problematic situation would be if N < NP . For N ≥ NP , mBR and mPV
are equal within the approximation used, and our analysis reorganizes the result within
a hyperasymptotic expansion. This allows us to quantitatively control the µ dependence,
and to parametrically state the error, of the result (for a given truncation) with NP power
accuracy using a hyperasymptotic counting.
We can also connect our results with mMRS , defined in [9], in the following way (the
expression of J can be found in Eq. (2.17) of [9]).

mMRS = mRS (m̄) + J (m̄) = m̄ +

N
X

(rn (m̄) − rn(as) (m̄))αn+1 (m̄) + J (m̄) .

(59)

n=0

In this definition, µ has been fixed to m̄. By doing so we cannot estimate the error associated
with the µ dependence of mMRS . Therefore, we introduce it and generalize the definition
of mMRS in the following way [we could indeed write a more general definition by putting
a different scale for the renormalon term: mMRS (νf ) = mRS (νf ) + J (νf ). This would still

21

achieve renormalon cancellation]:
N
X
mMRS (µ) = m̄ +

(60)

which makes explicit the µ scale dependence of the definition. In principle one could think
that, since it is related with RS mass, this would make a linear dependence in µ appear.
Remarkably enough this is not the case. We can relate this expression with the quantities
(N )

(N )

defined above. Indeed the difference between mMRS (µ) and mBR (µ) is proportional to ΛQCD :
(N )

(N )

mBR (µ) − mMRS (µ) = − cos(πb)

21+b β0 m

(61)

This quantity diverges in the large β0 limit, which makes it not possible to take the large
(N )

β0 limit of mMRS (µ) (alternative definitions were then proposed in [9]). The possibility to
subtract this term from the PV regulated Borel integral was also considered in [32], though
with a different (but related) motivation. In this respect, we note that subtracting this
quantity from the PV result has been criticized in [35], on the basis of analytic properties
of the observable. Nevertheless, this discussion is not directly relevant for us6 , as adding
or subtracting this term would just be equivalent to a change of resummation scheme that
can be absorbed in the genuine NP power correction. Note though that this difference is
√
parametrically bigger than m̄Ωm , since the latter scales like O( αΛQCD ). In any case, since
the difference with the PV result is a scale/scheme independent quantity proportional to
ΛQCD , the comparison with our analysis runs in complete parallel to the previous discussion
(N )

of mBR with respect to N . Again, problems will show up if N < NP , but for N ≥ NP , mMRS
is equal to mPV within the accuracy of the computation, except for Eq. (61). Therefore, it
can be written in terms of a modified version of the hyperasymptotic expansion discussed
in this section.
A more extensive discussion and a quantitative analysis for the case of the top, bottom
and charm quark masses will be carried out in [36].
6

It would be if we were able to relate the PV Borel integral with a NP definition of the observable.

22

B.

(N, µ) → ∞. Eq. (28). Case 2A)

As promising as method 1) is, it is worth it to explore alternatives that yield results that
are explicitly N (and therefore µ) independent. They may also lead to a better analytic
understanding of the observable. This can be achieved by taking µ and N going to infinity
in a correlated way. The simplest possibility one may consider is taking the limit as in 2A)
in Eq. (28).
The case 2A) was studied in the large β0 limit in [37, 38] for the case of the static
potential (a more general case, including subleading corrections to the running of α, was
also considered in [38]). It was observed that ST was logarithmically divergent in N and the
proportionality coefficient found. Nevertheless, it was not possible to get a direct connection
of this coefficient with the normalization of the leading renormalon in the Borel plane. This
problem has been solved in [39], where it has been shown how to relate the coefficient of the
ln N term with the normalization of the renormalon. This analysis has also been done for
the Adler function. Unfortunately, the validity of these findings is restricted to the large β0
approximation.
Beyond the large β0 approximation only the static potential has been studied [37, 38].
Remarkably enough the ln N (and an associated ln(ln rΛQCD )) behavior survives, albeit with
different coefficients. This may point to a certain universality (beyond large β0 ) of this result.
Unfortunately, it is not known now how to relate such coefficient with the normalization of
the renormalon. This would be very useful for analyses beyond the large β0 .
We will discuss all this in more detail in Sec. III C 1 where we study the static potential
in the large β0 approximation in this limit.

C.

(N, µ) → ∞. Eq. (28). Case 2B)

We have seen that ST was logarithmic divergent in N when taking the limit 2A). It was
also not possible to connect ST with its Borel sum. We now consider the limit 2B). In this
case one truncates before reaching the minimum, i.e. for N < N ∗ =

d2π
.
β0 αX (µ)

This will yield

a finite result. The other point we address is the relation of ST in the limit 2B) with its
Borel sum.
For some specific models of sign alternating perturbative series, it was soon realized that

23

the N → ∞ limit of their associated truncated sums could be related with a modified
version of the Borel integral [40, 41], if such N → ∞ limit is performed in an specific way.
For instance, it was shown that

Later work generalized this result to more general series expansions, even to some that
show a non-sign alternating series (but assuming that their Borel transform has a finite

results can be summarized in the following equation:

Therefore, we can

indeed sum the Borel series unambiguously inside the disc.
This was originally proven in [28, 42] by brute force computation. It was also proven
using a different method (integration in the complex plane) in [43] (in this last reference the
√
O(1/ N ) corrections were also computed). In both cases the running of the strong coupling
is restricted to follow the large β0 approximation.
Whereas the above result applies to arbitrary perturbative series (with the qualifications
mentioned above), the running of α is constrained to follow the large β0 approximation. This
is an important constraint if we want to consider the case of QCD, where the perturbative
expansion of the beta function is not a monomial but has more terms. One can bypass this
constraint if Eq. (2) in [43] is understood as a change of scheme instead of a change of

24

a renormalization scale. It is also possible to generalize the derivation of [43] for a strong
coupling with a general beta function. In this generalization new 1/N terms are generated.
Alternatively, one can slightly modify how the µ → ∞ is taken in Eq. (28). Instead of case

The difference with NA vanishes when µ → ∞. With this modified scaling it is possible to
show that Eq (5) in [43] holds taking k = N χ with χ = d/(1 − c0 α(Q)). The derivation
is then analogous to the derivation in [43]. Overall, we are then able to obtain (taking the
µ → ∞ limit according to 2B) of Eq. (28))

(69)

where c0 > 0 (this is the reason we took c0 > 0 in Eq. (28)). The reason for the sign of c0 is
that we have to approach to the closest singularity to the origin in the Borel plane from the
left. Indeed, in [28, 42], in the context of the large β0 approximation, it was shown that in
order the integral to be well defined one needed

the correct exponent (of the NP power correction) is obtained, i.e. the

difference is of the order of the leading NP term of the OPE. Nevertheless, one does not get
the right prefactor. This was quantified in [43], where it was first shown that using Eq. (69),
and expanding in α, the ambiguity is of the order of the higher order condensate with the
right α dependence of the prefactor.
The leading renormalon (the singularity in the Borel plane closest to the origin) gives the
main contribution to the difference between SP V and SA :

This contribution is O(α1+db−γ ) suppressed with respect the leading term. This is a problem
if one wants to obtain subleading corrections to the leading NP term, as one would need to
know the normalization coefficient of all subleading renormalons.
An issue observed in [43], in the context of the large β0 approximation, was that when
1/χ → d/2, i.e. when the integrand approaches the singularity of the Borel transform, the
truncated PV integral diverges, and it is not a good approximation of the PV integral (for
instance see Figs. 2 and 3 in [43]). Therefore, it is better not to make the combination
c0 α(Q) very small. We study this problem in the example we will consider in the following
section.
This observation also makes that we can not use the results obtained in this section to
the case 2A) obtained in the previous section, as it means setting χ = 2/d, i.e. exactly at
the singularity in the Borel plane. (yet it would be very interesting a dedicated study to see
if the analysis of this section can be generalized to the case χ = 2/d).

D.

Strategy

In summary, we have two alternative expressions (Eqs. (46) and (71)) to determine
SPV (Q) with ΛQCD power-like precision. Remarkably enough, we can achieve such precision even though we do not know the complete perturbative series expansion. The reason is
that we can relate SPV (Q) with the truncated sum of the perturbative series for both methods. We also obtain an analytic expression for the leading power correction that accounts
for the difference between the truncated sum and the PV result. One important feature
of this result is that, in both cases, the leading power correction can be determined if the
strength and structure of the leading singularity in the Borel plane is known. This result is
also true beyond the large β0 approximation. Such results are scheme independent.
There are important differences between both methods beyond the above general properties. The first one is that the method 2B) (the “µ → ∞ method”) yields a finite NP
correction in the limit Q → ∞. This is not so for the method 1) (the “µ = Q method”).
p
For the latter, the leading NP correction gets multiplied by the small factor α(Q), which
vanishes (albeit weakly) in the Q → ∞ limit. In principle, this makes the second method
better. Nevertheless, one should also keep in mind that, in order to profit from this property,
one needs to have physical data for as large as possible Q. Since in both cases the leading
corrections are known analytically this could not make a practical difference. A numerical
analysis can check which one is better. A more serious problem with the “µ → ∞ method”
is that, in order to take the µ → ∞ limit, one needs the running of α with higher and higher
precision. In the large β0 limit, the running of α is known exactly, so this is not a problem,
but it will be once we move beyond this approximation. One also needs higher and higher
order coefficients of the perturbative expansion as one takes the µ → ∞ limit. Again in the
large β0 limit the coefficients can be generated to any arbitrary finite order7 but not beyond
the large β0 limit. In the real case, the most we will have is the asymptotic behavior of the
high order coefficients.
Another important issue is that with the “µ = Q method” we are potentially capable
of computing corrections to the leading NP effect. The O(Λd α) corrections are still related
with the leading renormalon and can be computed. The effect of subleading renormalons

For the static potential this is indeed so, but even for the pole mass this is numerically demanding.

27

give power suppressed corrections. For the “µ → ∞ method” the O(Λd α) corrections receive
corrections from all subleading renormalons. In practice, this makes it impossible to compute
these corrections in a controlled way.
In general it is impossible to obtain closed results for the PV regulated perturbative sum
on which to test the above results. This is only possible in the large β0 approximation for
a few cases. Here, we use one of them as a laboratory to check the methods we will apply
to physical cases. The question here is to quantify the difference between the PV result
(which we take as a “fake” NP data), and the truncated perturbative expansions (for large
values of N ). Obviously such comparison is made in the short distance limit where the OPE
should apply. In Sec. III, we check our formulas (in the large β0 approximation) for the
case of the static potential. This example will allow us to quantify (in practice) when the
complete result is well approximated by Eqs. (46) and (71). In particular, we try to answer
the following questions: How large Q has to be in both cases8 , how large µ has to be for
Eq. (71) to hold. We also study the dependence of the answer to the scale/scheme used for
the strong coupling (we use lattice and MS scheme).
The method that leads to Eq. (71) requires µ → ∞. Formally, this means that we
need all the coefficients pn . As in realistic cases we do not have this information, we check
the dependence on approximating the exact perturbative coefficients (starting at different
orders) by their asymptotic expansions in the large β0 approximation. In this case we will be
able to see the error introduced by considering different orders from which one approximates
the coefficients by the asymptotic behavior. What we will not be able to test in the large
β0 approximation is the dependence on the higher order coefficients of the beta function,
which are needed for Eq. (71) (since we need to run α(µ) to µ = ∞). This is relegated to
subsequent work.
Note that all the scheme dependence (in the broad sense: T ={N , X, µ}) has disappeared
up to terms beyond the accuracy we achieve. We also obtain expressions for the difference
between different truncation schemes.
8

This is expected to be dependent on nf . The bigger nf the smaller the renormalon effect. Therefore, any
discussion with nf = 0 should be understood as an upper bound of the importance of renormalons.

III.

THE STATIC POTENTIAL IN THE LARGE β0 APPROXIMATION

The large β0 approximation cannot be obtained from a well defined limit of the parameters of QCD. Still, it is useful to test techniques that can be used beyond the large
β0 approximation in a place where we know the exact solution. In this respect the static
potential is an ideal object, since we have a lot of analytic control for it.

). If X = MS then cMS = −5/3 (in the large β0 approximation).

If X = V then cV = 0. If X = latt, we take the nf = 0 number for a Wilson action:
clatt = −8.38807 [44], as we will only use this scheme for checking the consistency between
the results obtained with different schemes. We also define Λ̃ = ΛX e−cX /2 and ρ = Λ̃r. Note
that Λ̃ is scheme independent.
Eq. (77) is ill defined but not its Borel transform. It reads [45]

We have checked that the numerical determinations of both definitions give the same. We
can then use this PV prescription as a NP definition of the observable, to which to test our
methods and approximations. Note that this definition is indeed scheme independent. On
the other hand the result is an oscillating function of r, which violates general properties
of the static potential (energy) of two static sources in the fundamental representation [46].
These state that the potential should be concave (we should also keep in mind that we are
working in the large β0 limit, which is not a well-defined limit of QCD).
We now consider the short distance limit (r → 0) of VPV (r). In other words, we analyze
its OPE. First, we study how well we can approximate VPV (r) by its perturbative expansion
at weak coupling. Thus, we approximate the potential by the truncated perturbative sum:

VN ≡

N
X

Vn αn+1 .

(82)

n=0

For fixed µ, the N → ∞ limit of VN diverges since the perturbative expansion is asymptotic.
Therefore, we have to be careful in the definition used for the truncated sum. For such object,
30

we use the two definitions discussed in Sec. II (with Q = 1/r). For both of them we will
need the normalization of the leading renormalon. In the large β0 it reads
ZV = −2

CF − cX
e 2 .
π

(83)

It agrees with the result from the pole mass [47] after using that the renormalon of the pole
mass cancels with the renormalon of the static potential [2].
We will perform computations with nf = 0 and nf = 3. In the first case we will work
in lattice units (aiming to compare with quenched lattice simulations) and use ΛMS (nf =
0) = 0.602r0−1 ≈ 238 MeV [48]. In the large β0 approximation (with nf = 0), this yields
α(Mτ ) ≈ 0.29. In the second case we take ΛMS (nf = 3) = 174 MeV. This last number
we fix such that it gives a reasonable value at the τ mass in the large β0 approximation:
α(Mτ ) ≈ 0.3 (see for instance [49]).
We then confront VPV with the results obtained with these methods.

Unlike in the limit 2) (see expressions in Sec. III C), in the limit case 1), Eq. (27),
we do not have direct analytic control in the relation between VPV and VP (unlike what
will happen in Sec. III C when using the limit case 2), Eq. (28)). Nevertheless, we can
numerically compute both and check that their difference complies with the theoretical
expectations. We can study (even if in the large β0 approximation) up to which values of
r the OPE is a good approximation of VPV . Remarkably enough we can actually check
more than one term of the OPE (hyperasymptotic) expansion. We also explore the scheme
dependence by performing the computation in the lattice and the MS scheme (actually in
the large β0 approximation this is equivalent to a change of scale). We will do these analyses
for the cases with nf = 0 and nf = 3. The first in view of comparing with quenched
lattice simulations, the second to simulate a more physical scenario, for which we can draw
some conclusions that could be applied beyond the large-β0 limit. In Figs. 1, 2, and 3 we

is particularly so when including ΩV (Ω0V ) to its associated sum.
Let us discuss the results in more detail. We first observe that the r dependence of VPV
is basically eliminated in VPV − VP , as expected. This happens both in the lattice and MS

35

scheme. The latter shows an stronger c dependence. This is to be expected, as in the MS,
we truncate at smaller orders in N . This makes the truncation error bigger. Note that the
lattice scheme can be understood (in the large β0 approximation) as the MS scheme with a
larger factorization scale. As we can see in the upper panel of Fig. 3, both schemes yield
consistent predictions for VPV − VP . We can draw some interesting observations out of this
analysis. For VPV − VP it is better to choose a larger factorization scale, if we have enough
coefficients of the perturbative expansion. This is particularly so at large distances: We can
still get sound results up to very large distances in the lattice scheme.
We now turn to VPV − VP − 1r ΩV . Adding the new correction produces a better agreement
with expectations (which we recall is to get zero). After the introduction of 1r ΩV , the MS
scheme yields more accurate results than the lattice scheme. This can already be seen in
the upper panel of Fig. 3, and in greater detail in the lower panel of Fig. 3.
VPV − VP − 1r ΩV shows some dependence on 1/r, which is more pronounced in the lattice
than in the MS scheme. As in the large β0 the difference between both schemes is equivalent
to a change of scale, this results points to that µ = 1/r in MS is close to the natural scale and
minimize higher order corrections. Note that the lattice scheme computation is equivalent
clatt

c
MS

to the MS scheme choosing µlatt = µMS e− 2 e 2 . This gives around a factor 30!!. Once
P3NP
(as)
)αn+1 is incorporated in the prediction most of the difference disappears
n=NP +1 (Vn − Vn
and the lattice scheme is marginally better. Nevertheless, after introducing Ω0V , the MS
becomes marginally better again. In any case, the difference between schemes gets smaller
and smaller as we go to higher orders in the hyperasymptotic expansion, in particular at
short distances.
We also want to stress that this analysis opens the window to apply perturbation theory
at rather large distances. Note that in the upper panel plots in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, we have
gone to very large distances.
As some concluding remarks let us emphasize the following points. The truncated sum
is more or less constant with relatively large uncertainties. This is to be expected, as the
next correction in magnitude is ΩV which is approximately constant (mildly modulated
p
by α(µ)). After introducing this term the error is much smaller and we can see more
P3NP
(as)
structure. In particular we are sensitive to n=N
(Vn − Vn )αn+1 . Here we find (at
P +1
the level of precision we have now) a sizable difference between lattice and MS. This can
P3NP
(as)
be expected:
)αn+1 is the object we expect to be more sensitive to the
n=NP +1 (Vn − Vn

scale.
In the lattice and MS scheme, we observe a very nice convergence pattern up to (surprisingly) rather large scales. The agreement with the theoretical prediction (which is zero) is
perfect at short distances. The estimated error is also expected to be small. It would be
interesting to see if this also happens beyond the large β0 .
Another interesting observation is that truncated sums behave better in the lattice scheme
than in the MS scheme. Nevertheless, this could be missleading. The sums are truncated at
the minimal term. Therefore, one needs more terms in the lattice scheme. If the number of
terms is not an issue (which could be the case with dedicated numerical stochastic perturbation theory (NSPT) [50, 51] computations in the lattice scheme) then the lattice scheme
looks better. But as soon as ΩV is introduced in the computation MS behaves better (at
least in the large β0 approximation).
We now turn to the nf = 3 case. We note that ΛQCD for the physical case (nf = 3)
is smaller than for the nf = 0 case (if one sets the physical scale according to r0−1 ≈ 400
MeV). On top of that the running is less important. All this points to that the convergence
should be even better than in the nf = 0 case (and it was quite good already there). We
show our results in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 (these are the analogous of Figs. 1, 2 and 3 but with
nf = 3). These plots confirm our expectations. Down to scales as low as 667 MeV we see
no sign of breakdown of the hyperasymptotic expansion. This is so in both the lattice and
the MS schemes. Note that the precision we get is extremely high as we go to small scales:

n=NP +1 (Vn − Vn

one for nf = 0.

In the above numerics, we have used the exact expression for ΩV and Ω0V . In full QCD, we will
not know the exact expression. Therefore, it makes sense to study how well the exact result

I and II for an illustrative set of values the exact result and the truncated semiclassical
expansion. We observe that the exact result is very well saturated by the first terms of
the expansion computed in Eq. (37). Truncating the expansion produces differences much
smaller than the typical precision of the different terms of the hyperasymptotic expansion.

As expected nf = 3 is better than nf = 0. Note that in the large β0 approximation we
exactly have Λ = µe−2π/(β0 α(µ)) .
An alternative, very effective, presentation of the above results can be done by plotting the
relative accuracy of the prediction at each order in α and at each order of the superasymptotic expansion. We note that we have one observable for each value of r. Therefore, for

expression of ΩV , since the NNLO truncated expression is not precise enough. We also nicely
see that, once reached the minimum, both schemes yield similar precision, but in the lattice
scheme (bigger factorization scale µ) more terms of the perturbative expansions are needed
to reach the same precision. One important lesson one may extrapolate from this exercise

is that, for a fixed order computation, the smaller the renormalization scale µ, the better.
One can obtain much better precision for an equal number of perturbative coefficients. Another observation is that the minimal term determined numerically need not to coincide with
the minimal term computed using n = NP (though it should not be much different). The
difference reflects how much the exact coefficient is saturated by the asymptotic expression.

The potential advantage of this method is that we can obtain analytic results that are µ
independent. We profit from earlier analyses in [37, 38] adapted to our case. In all cases the
q integrals will be done in the complex plane along similar lines as the computation done in
those references.

In this explicit representation of VPV each term scales differently in powers of ρ: O(vC ) ∼ ρ−1 ,
the ρ0 term is set to zero (or incorporated in vC ), and each O(ρ2n+1 ) term is encoded in
π
(cos ρ − 1).
ρ

Still, Eq. (94) can not be understood as an explicit representation of the OPE,

since the NP power corrections scale with odd powers of ρ, and indeed there are no O(ρ2n )
terms. However, this splitting naturally leads to define a short distance coupling:
αSD (1/r) = −r

4
Λ̃vC (r) .
β0

(95)

This definition has nice properties. It is an smooth function ∀ r ∈ (0, ∞), with the right
short distance limit:
αSD (1/r) =

2π 1
β0 ln(ρr)

r → 0.

(96)

A detailed study of this quantity can be found in [38]. Note also that in this definition the
whole O(ΛQCD ) correction has been included in

4CF
β0

Λ̃vC (r). The other thing that one could

study, since we have the analytic behavior, is the behavior of αSD beyond the regime where
it was originally defined, i.e. at long distances. In this respect, it is interesting to notice

44

that the long distance limit
αSD (0) =

4π
β0

(97)

is exactly equal to the value obtained in [52], within the context of analytic perturbation
theory analyses. Nevertheless, one could as well argue that all O(ρ2n+1 ) terms are short
distances and should be incorporated in αSD . If one does so, αSD does not have an smooth
limit for ρ → 0 anymore. Finally, one could also study the β function of αSD .
It has some interest to compare Eq. (85), the hyperasymptotic expansion using method
1), with Eq. (94). We can make the comparison at o(ΛQCD ) and at o(Λ3QCD r2 ) in the
hyperasymptotic expansion. We show such comparison in Fig. 8. At o(ΛQCD ), the leading
power correction in Eq. (94) is of O(ρ). We find that Eq. (85) is more convergent, which is
consistent with the estimated made in Eq. (50). Either way, the convergence is extremely
good. The precision is much below the MeV.

In real life we will not have such complete analytic control and must rely on the methods
discussed in Sec. II. Therefore, we now apply the limit 2A) and 2B) discussed in Eq. (28) to
VN .

For completeness, we have also obtained the ln(N ) behavior in a different way. We follow
the method recently proposed in [39]. There, a summation integral relation was found for a
general observable. We applied it to the case of the first IR renormalon of the potential and
pole mass. The advantage of this new method is that the ln N term can be determined if
the normalization of the leading renormalon in the Borel plane is known. It would be very
interesting to try to generalize this result beyond the large β0 approximation, as well as to
extend the analysis to the ln ln( ρ1 ) term.
The fact that we have certain analytic control of the result allows us to address some
issues. The first one is to make explicit that truncated sums around the minimal term do not
guarantee, per se, that they are finite. In particular, one can see that VN is divergent in the
N → ∞. Therefore, it would be wrong to assign VN to the leading term in the hyperasymptotic expansion of VPV . On the other hand, we have analytic control on the divergence,
which is found to be logarithmic in N .9 In principle, one can subtract this ln N divergence
from VN (this is completely analogous to subtracting 1/ divergences in perturbative computations using dimensional regularization) to obtain the first term of the hyperasymptotic
expansion. Nevertheless, the difference does not still scale like ΛQCD . Instead one has

It is worth mentioning again that this ln N behavior also appears beyond the large β0 approximation in
the context of the static potential [38].

which, at short distances, scales as ΛQCD ln ln( ρ1 ) (this behavior is also seen beyond the
large β0 approximation in the context of the static potential [38]). Therefore, to get the
proper scaling in ΛQCD of the different terms of the hyperasymptotic expansion requires
that the ΛQCD ln ln( ρ1 ) should be identified and subtracted first from VN . One then has the
freedom to subtract O(ΛQCD ) finite pieces, which can be absorbed in the next term of the
hyperasymptotic expansion.
We do not do a numerical analysis here, as the method cannot, at present, be generalised
beyond the large β0 approximation.

Note that this far, the expressions for v1 and v3 are valid ∀ r. It is also possible, and most

Since the result we obtain is finite, we could as well taken N + 1 → N = NA in Eq. (104), and the result

sum. This is a pleasant property.

Again this result is valid ∀ r. We now focus on the ρ → 0 limit. This will allows us to
connect with the limit 2B) of Eq. (28). Nevertheless, this connection has to be done with
care. One has to take the limit r → 0 and s → 2 in a correlated way, following the limit
2B) of Eq. (28). Therefore, we take
s = 2 − c0 α(1/r) .

We have already emphasized that obtaining the ρ → 0 limit was delicate. Let us illustrate

If we rephrase this discussion in terms of the c0 behavior, what we have is that Eq. (110)
is not obtained by taking the limit c0 → 0 before taking the limit r → 0 of Eq. (109).
Indeed, the limit c0 → 0 before taking the limit r → 0 produces Eq. (114), which does not
correspond to the limit 2B) we are following in this paper. As we can see from the explicit
computation, both limits yield NP power corrections with the right scaling (pointing out
that there is not unique procedure to get/define the NP correction). Nevertheless, the overall
coefficient is different, whereas Eq. (110) diverges logarithmically in c0 , Eq. (114) diverges
like 1/c0 for small c0 . In this paper we stick to method 2B) as it allows us to go beyond
the large β0 approximation and to relate the normalization of the power correction with the
normalization of the renormalon.

Finally, note that this method has the pleasant feature that the generated O(ΛQCD )
correction complies with the OPE. It also yields results that do not depend on N (and µ)
anymore. Still, it has some errors and does not reach the precision of method 1). There is

a residual scheme dependence associated with uncomputed terms of O(αΛQCD ). Part of it
can be estimated by the residual dependence in c0 . In order to estimate it, we compute VA
for different values of c0 . On the one hand c0 cannot be very large, as c0 α(1/r) should be
relatively close to zero. On the other hand we cannot make c0 α(1/r) to get arbitrary close
to zero, as the O(ΛQCD ) correction diverges logarithmically in c0 . We also note that there
(A)

is a value of c0 = c0min that makes that KX = 0 so that the O(ΛQCD ) correction vanishes.
Therefore, we compute VA for different values of c0 . For illustration we show some results in
52

(A)

Figs. 9 and 10. We draw lines for VPV − VA − KX ΛX at c0 = 1 and c0 = cmin generating
a band. We also explore the dependence on the scheme by comparing the results in the
lattice and MS scheme. We stress again that in the large β0 approximation lattice and MS
schemes just correspond to a redefinition of µ, but quite large indeed. On the other hand
the final result is µ independent. Nevertheless, the way the µ → ∞ limit is taken is fixed
by NA , as defined in Eq. (28), which is dependent on µ. This explains why different results
are obtained.
In Figs. 9 and 10, we also compare with results obtained using method 1), more specifically we compare with VPV −VP − 1r ΩV , as they both have analogous power accuracy (though
method 1) is parametrically more precise). For ΩV we take the exact expression but using
its approximated expression does not change the discussion, as the difference is very small.
What we see is that the MS scheme yields more precise predictions than the lattice scheme,
and that method 1) yields considerable better results than method 2B).
Another issue specific to method 2B) is to determine how large we need to take N (and
consequently µ) of the truncated sum such that it approximates well VA . For illustrative
purposes we show the convergence in Fig. 11 for nf = 3 in the lattice and MS scheme. We
find that we have to go to relatively large values of µ (and N ) to get it precise. This can
be a problem if one wants to go beyond the large β0 . This problem would be less severe if
one can use the asymptotic expression for the coefficients beyond certain n. Nicely enough,
we find that the use of the asymptotic expression for the coefficients for n > N ∗ (∼ 3 in the
MS and ∼ 8 in the lattice scheme) is very efficient and basically yields the same results as
the exact result. Finally, we also recall that to approximate well VA by the truncated sum
is more costly for small values of c0 .

IV.

CONCLUSION

We aim to accurately describe observables characterized by having a large scale Q 
ΛQCD . For those it is believed that the OPE is a good approximation (we do not enter in this
paper on the issue of duality violations). We want to make the most of available perturbative
expressions of the observable. Our aim is to organize the computation and its associated
accuracy within a hyperasymptotic expansion. For this, we carefully study the connection
between truncated sums of the perturbative expansions in powers of α and the associated
53

NP corrections. In practice, we relate those truncated sums with the Borel sum of the
perturbative series regulated using the PV prescription. This object has the nice properties
of being scale and scheme independent. It may also open the window to connect with
studies directly aiming to the NP regime. We then hypothesize that the difference between
the Borel sum and the full NP evaluation of the observable complies with the structure of
the NP OPE (at least for the first terms of the NP power expansion). Such computational
scheme allows us to get a hyperasymptotic expansion of the observable, and, consequently, to
unambiguously state the magnitude of the different terms of the hyperasymptotic expansion.
Relating truncated sums of the perturbative expansion with NP definitions of them is
not trivial in general. However, this is possible for the case of the PV prescription. We have
studied two methods that achieve this goal and explored how reliable they are in practice.
We have given analytic formulas (with exponential accuracy) that relate the truncated sum
with the PV-regulated Borel sum. We emphasize that these formulas are valid beyond the
large-β0 approximation.
These methods allow us to efficiently disentangle the pure perturbative term from the
first NP corrections of an arbitrary observable that admits an OPE at large energies. General expressions for arbitrary observables are given (for this paper we neglect ultraviolet
renormalons). Nevertheless, the accuracy we achieve for each case is different:
• The method 2B) (see Eq. (76)) has the handicap that (in principle) needs the perturbative expansion of the observable and the running of α to all orders. On top of that
we are only able to obtain the O(e

(Q)) term of the Borel sum, which then

sets the precision of the analysis. On the other hand, it has the nice feature that the
leading NP power correction of the Borel sum has exactly the same scaling as the NP
corrections dictated by the OPE, and that the result is explicitly µ independent.
• On the other hand, method 1) (see Eq. (75)) shows to be much more powerful. At
low orders it is just standard perturbation theory. At high orders (quantified by NP )
the series is truncated. This corresponds to the superasymptotic approximation. We
can quantify the error committed in summations truncated at the minimal term and
state the independence of the result on the scale and scheme used for the perturbative expansion to a given accuracy. This allows us to state the parametric accuracy
of determinations of genuine NP power corrections obtained by subtracting the per54

turbative series from the full observable (the latter being obtained either from lattice
simulations or directly from experiment).
We then incorporate the NP corrections to the truncated sum associated with the
renormalons using the PV regularization prescription. The procedure uses the theory
of terminants discussed in [14]. The scale and scheme dependence of this merging is
under control in the whole process. This process is, in principle, systematically improvable. Subleading power corrections can be incorporated in the analysis, reaching
hyperasymptotic accuracy. This analysis also allows us to visualize that truncating
the perturbative sum at the minimal term produces, in general, terms that cannot
√
be absorbed in the NP terms of the OPE, because of prefactors proportional to α.
Overall, one obtains an smooth connection between the standard (pure) perturbative
computation and the OPE (hyperasymptotic) expansion that includes the NP power
corrections.
With these methods it is possible to determine the leading difference between the perturbative series truncated at the minimal term with the Borel integral regulated using the
PV prescription in terms of the closest singularity to the origin of the Borel transform. This
is very good because it allows us to determine such leading NP correction in terms of the
normalization of the leading renormalon, ZOXd , for which approximate determinations can be
obtained if the perturbative series is known to high enough orders. It is also worth mentioning that the dependence on ZOXd of the hyperasymptotic approximation to the Borel sum is
minimal, since it only appears in Ω. Finally note that there is no need of introducing an
infrared cutoff νf .
We plan to apply these methods to general observables, but before we want to study the
methods in test-objects for which the approximations are under control. In this paper we take
the static potential in the large β0 approximation, regulating the asymptotic perturbative
expansion using the PV prescription, as the observable. It has nice properties: A lot of
analytic control is known for it, its Borel transform is known exactly, and it does not have
ultraviolet renormalons. In this case we know what the genuine NP corrections are. They
are zero by construction.
Whereas the general expressions we give in this paper are valid for any scheme, for the
specific analysis worked out in this paper (the static potential in the large β0 approximation), we use two different schemes: the lattice and the MS schemes. In the large β0 this is
55

equivalent to a redefinition of the renormalization scale. Nevertheless, let us stress that it
corresponds to a rather large change in the scale. Different values of c (see Eq. (27)) can
also be understood as a change in the renormalization scale. The result is independent on
the scheme and factorization scale used for the α (within the error of the computation). The
scheme/scale dependence is a higher order effect. The important thing is that both schemes
converge. This does not mean that all schemes converge equally fast. We observe that MS
appears to be more convenient for method 2B). It is also interesting to see the dependence
of the observables/methods with nf . Indeed we observe that the range of validity of the
hyperasymptotic expansion is sensitive to the value of nf . Changing from nf = 0 to nf = 3
significantly enlarges the range of validity of the OPE. This is a relevant discussion when
trying to determine up to which scale one can apply perturbation theory and the OPE.
Concerning how well method 1) and 2B) perform in practice for this observable, we find
that both methods converge to the expected result. Method 2B) is not particularly precise
though. Method 1) appears to converge faster (besides being systematically improvable).
Finally, and specific to method 2B), one issue that we address is how large the renormalization scale µ has to be such that the perturbative expansion simulates well the truncated
integral in Eq. (68). For the case of the static potential in the large β0 approximation, we
observe that we have to go to relatively high scales. This makes this method not very useful.
The application of these analyses to QCD observables (beyond the large β0 approximation) and the incorporation of ultraviolet renormalons (if necessary) is left to forthcoming
papers.
