Recently, it has been shown that there is a trade-off relation between thermodynamic cost and current fluctuations, referred to as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR). The TUR has been derived for various processes, such as discrete-time Markov jump processes and overdamped Langevin dynamics. For underdamped
dynamics, it has recently been reported that some modification is necessary for application of the TUR. In
this study, we present a more generalized TUR, applicable to a system driven by a velocity-dependent force
in the context of underdamped Langevin dynamics, by extending the theory of Vu and Hasegawa [preprint
arXiv:1901.05715]. We show that our TUR accurately describes the trade-off properties of a molecular refrigerator (cold damping), Brownian dynamics in a magnetic field, and an active particle system.

INTRODUCTION

The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is a tradeoff relation between current fluctuations and entropy production (EP) [1, 2]. Generally, for an accumulated current Θ over
a given time period T , such as work, displacement, etc., the
TUR states that the relative fluctuation multiplied by the EP is
always larger than or equal to 2kB in the steady state; that is,
the original TUR can be written as
Qori (Θ) ≡

Var[Θ]
σs T ≥ 2kB ,
hΘi2s

(1)

where h· · · is denotes a steady-state average, Var[Θ] = hΘ2 is −
hΘi2s is the variance in Θ, σs is the steady-state EP rate, and kB
is the Boltzmann constant. Note that we use the subscript ‘ori’
to distinguish the original TUR from other modified TURs.
This relation implies that it costs a large amount of EP (heat
dissipation) to achieve high accuracy (low relative fluctuation)
with a stochastic motion.
The TUR was first discovered in a biological network [1].
It has since been derived for a continuous-time Markov jump
process over a finite time [3–5], as well as in the long-time
limit [2], and for an overdamped Langevin system [4, 6, 7].
It has also been shown that the TUR should be modified for
discrete-time Markov jump processes [8], linear-response systems [9], and periodically driven systems [10–12]. Moreover,
the TUR was utilized in [13] for understanding the relations
between the power, efficiency, constancy of a heat engine [14–
23].
The validity of the TUR was questioned recently for underdamped Langevin dynamics [24]. Subsequently, Vu and
Hasegawa [25] demonstrated that the original TUR, Eq. (1),
can be violated for a squared velocity current in equilibrium
and for displacement of the Brownian particle in a tilted periodic potential. They derived a modified TUR for the under-

(2)

where Υ is the dynamical activity and Ω is a boundary term
defined as in Eq. (18).
However, Eq. (2) is derived under the assumption that an
external force is only position-dependent, and not velocitydependent. Therefore, Eq. (2) cannot be applied to a system
such as that studied by Chun et al. [26], wherein a charged
Brownian particle moves under a magnetic field; specifically,
they showed that Eq. (1) can be violated when a magnetic field
and a rotational force are applied simultaneously. To account
for the effect of a Lorentz force on the TUR, a more generalized TUR is required, taking into consideration a velocitydependent force in the underdamped dynamics. Velocitydependent force plays a key role in many important contexts, such as molecular refrigerators (cold damping) [27–
32], collective motions of active/passive Brownian particles
with velocity-dependent interactions [33–39], and certain active matter dynamics [40–45].
In this work, we extend the uncertainty relation, Eq.(2) so
that it is applicable to underdamped Langevin systems with
a general velocity-dependent force. We find that a velocitydependent force only changes the dynamical activity term
as presented in Eq. (18). We examine the applicability of
our inequality to three physical systems driven by velocitydependent forces: a cold-damping problem, a magnetic-field
involved problem, and an active matter problem. From these
concrete examples, we show that our inequality is valid for a
system driven by a velocity-dependent force, while the original TUR [1] and that of Vu and Hasegawa’s [25] do not hold.
We also identify several conditions allowing the lowest bound
of the inequality to be attained, which was claimed to be impossible in a previous study [25].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we explain our model system and derive the generalized TUR for
the underdamped Langevin system with a velocity-dependent
force. The main results are presented in Eq. (20). In Section
3, we calculate our inequality for three cases: cold-damping,

2
a charged particle in a magnetic field, and an active matter
system. In Section 4, we conclude the paper with a brief summary and discussion.
II.

MODEL AND GENERALIZED TUR

We consider a N-particle underdamped Langevin system,
where the i-th particle (i = 1, · · · , N) is in contact with a heat
reservoir with temperature T i . Define xi and vi as position and
velocity of the i-th particle, respectively. A general positionand-velocity dependent force Fi (x, v) is applied to the i-th particle, where x = (x1 , · · · , xN ) and v = (v1 , · · · , vN ). The dynamics of the i-th particle is described by the following equation:
ẋi = vi , mi v̇i = Fi (x, v) − γi vi + ξi ,

(7)

The total EP is determined by the ratio between the two
trajectory probabilities P[Γ] and P† (Γ̃), that is, ∆S tot =
ln[P[Γ]/P† [Γ̃]] [46]. In addition, the average EP rate can
be written as [48, 51]:

The main goal of this study is finding a generalized TUR
for a general current Θ which has the following form:
Z T
dtΛ(x(t), v(t)) ◦ v(t),
(9)
Θ[Γ] =
0

where mi , γi , and ξi are the mass, the damping coefficient, and the Gaussian white noise, satisfying hξi (t)ξ j (t′ )i =
2kB γi T i δi j δ(t − t′ ), respectively. For brevity, we set kB = 1
for the following discussion. If we define P(x, v, t) as the
probability distribution function, this dynamics can be also
described by the following Fokker-Planck equation:

where Λ is an arbitrary N-dimensional vector and ◦ denotes
the Stratonovich multiplication. To go further, we take the
virtual perturbation approach by Vu and Hasegawa [6, 7, 25].
First, consider an auxiliary dynamics

N
X

where Hθ,i is an auxiliary force with Hθ=0,i = Fi − γi vi .
Thus, the auxiliary dynamics (10) becomes the original dynamics (3) at θ = 0. The detailed form of Hθ,i will be given
later. The trajectory probability density in the auxiliary dynamics is denoted by Pθ [Γ]. In the Onsager-Machlup formulation [54], Pθ [Γ] in the Ito scheme is given by

∂t P(x, v, t) = −

(∂ xi J xi + ∂vi Jvi ),

(4)

i=1

where the probabilistic currents J xi = vi P(x, v, t) and Jvi =
−1
m−1
i [−γi vi + F i (x, v) − T i γi mi ∂vi ]P(x, v, t).
Now we consider a single trajectory in the (x, v) phase space
of this dynamics from time t = 0 to t = T , which is denoted by
t=T
Γ ≡ [x(t), v(t)]t=0
. Note that (x0 , v0 ) is the starting point of this
trajectory. The probability density observing the trajectory Γ
is denoted by P[Γ]. To calculate the EP (or irreversibility),
we need to define the time-reverse dynamics [46]. The timereverse position and velocity variables, x̃ and ṽ, should satisfy
x̃˙i = ṽi , mi ṽ˙ i = Fi† (x̃, ṽ) − γi ṽi + ξi ,

(5)

where the † operation reverses signs of all odd parameters in
the time-reversal process. P† [Γ̃] is the probability density obt=T
serving the time-reverse trajectory Γ̃ ≡ [x(T −t), −v(T −t)]t=0
in the † dynamics of Eq. (5). Note that there is no unique way
to choose odd parameters for the time-reversal process. For
example, one may regard a magnetic field as an odd parameter, so change the sign of a magnetic field in the time-reverse
dynamics [21, 47]. On the other hand, one may keep the sign
of the magnetic field for the irreversibility [48–52], where the
† dynamics is identical to the original time-forward dynamics. Nonetheless, we will show later that the generalized TUR
does not depend on the choice of odd parameters.
With a certain choice of odd parameters, we divide the force
into the reversible and irreversible one as
Fi (x, v) = Firev (x, v) + Fiir (x, v),

(6)
†

with Firev (x, v) = Firev † (x, −v), and Fiir (x, v) = −Fiir (x, −v).
Then, we get the irreversible part of the velocity component

ẋi = vi , mi v̇i = Hθ,i (x, v) + ξi ,

Now, we calculate the Fisher information I(θ) at θ = 0.
The second bulk term in Eq. (13) can be split into the term
proportional to the EP and the term proportional to the dynamic activity, while the first term yields the boundary term
independent of the time duration T . After some algebra in the
steady state, we arrive at

where σs is the steady-state EP rate given by Eq. (8), Υuv is
the generalized dynamic activity, and Ω is the boundary term,
which are expressed by

where the subscript ‘uv’ represents the ‘underdamped dynamics with a velocity dependent force’. The main difference of
Eq. (20) from Eq. (2) is the form of the dynamical activity.
This difference goes away without a velocity-dependent force
by setting ∂vi Fi = 0 and Fiir = 0. It should be emphasized
that Σuv is independent of the choice of odd parameters, even
though the EP rate σs and the dynamic activity Υ depends on
the choice, respectively. This implies that the original TUR
depends on this choice. We also note that, when Λ has only
position-dependent terms, hΘ′ is = 0. If Λi (x, v) = λi (x)vdi ,
hΘ′ is /hΘis = d. These cases had been previously discussed in
Ref. [25].

EXAMPLES

In this section, we test our generalized TUR (20) for three
systems affected by velocity-dependent forces: (i) a molecular
refrigerator, (ii) a Brownian particle in a magnetic field with a
rotational force, and (iii) an active matter system.
A. Molecular refrigerator

Here, we consider a one-dimensional Brownian particle immersed in a reservoir with temperature T . Its position and
velocity are denoted by x and v, respectively. An external linear dissipative force −αv is applied to the particle. Then, the
equation of motion becomes
ẋ = v, mv̇ = −αv − γv + ξ,

(21)

where γ and ξ are the damping coefficient and the Gaussian white noise satisfying hξ(t)ξ(t′ )i = 2γT δ(t − t′ ), respectively. Note that α + γ > 0 for the stability of the dynamics.
Equation (21) describes the motion of the simplest molecular
refrigerator [27–32]. The external dissipative force reduces
the thermal fluctuation of the particle when α > 0. Thus,
its motion is effectively the same as that of a particle in a
cooler environment, which mimics a refrigerator at the particle level. This mechanism is often used for reducing thermal
fluctuations of a mesoscopic system such as a suspended mirror of interferometric detectors [28, 29] and an atomic-forcemicroscope (AFM) cantilever [30, 31].
The steady state of Eq. (21) is given by the Boltzmann distribution, that is,

where T ′ = γT/(γ + α) is the effective temperature.
In this problem, we choose the reversible and irreversible
forces as follows:
F rev = 0, F ir = −αv, F = 2αv.

(23)

Then, it is straightforward to show that Υuv = (α + γ)/m from
the fact hv2 is = T ′ /m. In addition, the irreversible current
becomes zero from Eq. (7), thus σs = 0. Finally, Ω = 4.
Therefore, Σuv of the molecular refrigerator becomes

Note that we can choose another reversible and irreversible
force as F rev = −αv and F ir = 0, respectively [32]. In this
case, the EP rate changes as σs = α2 /[m(α + γ)] (called as
entropy pumping [32]), while Σmr
uv remains unchanged.
To test the validity of Eq. (20), we choose the work current
for Θ with Λ(v) = −αv. It is easy to calculate the average
work in the steady state as

where χ = T /τrelax is the observation time in the unit of the
relaxation time τrelax ≡ m/(α + γ). This factor turns out to be
always larger than 2, as expected (see Fig. 1). It is noteworthy
to mention that the lowest bound (Quv → 2) is reachable in
both the χ → 0 (short-time) and χ → ∞ (long-time) limit.
Thus, our generalized TUR provides a tight bound for work
fluctuations in this case.
To confirm our analysis, we performed numerical calculations by solving Eq. (21) using a generalized velocity-Verlet
algorithm [55] which is correct up to the second order of simumr
lation time step ∆t = 0.01. We obtained Qmr
uv (W ) by averag7
ing over 10 sample paths starting from random initial states
sampled from the steady-state distribution (22). Numerical
results are shown in Figure 1, which are perfectly matched to
the analytic curve (27).
We check whether the original TUR (1) is valid or not in
this model. As mentioned previously, the EP rate depends on
the choice of the odd parameters. With the choice of F rev = 0
and F ir = −αv, we get σs = 0. Therefore, the original TUR
mr
factor Qmr
ori (W ) = 0, which clearly violates the original TUR.
With the choice of F rev = −αv and F ir = 0, we get σs =

When α > 0,
becomes smaller than 2. Again, the
original TUR is broken.
Furthermore, the modified TUR found by Vu and

where F = −αv. The EP rate is choice-dependent as discussed
above. It turns out that any choice yields a negative value for
Σu in Eq. (2) for some parameter range of α, which clearly
demonstrates the violation of Eq. (2).
B. Brownian particle in a magnetic field with a rotational force

Recently, Chun et al. [26] studied the validity of the original TUR for a Brownian particle in a magnetic field. They

of the rescaled observation time χ. Red circles, blue down-triangles,
and cyan squares are the numerical results for (α, γ) = (0.33, 0.67),
(0.5, 0.5), and (0.67, 0.33), respectively. For this calculation, m = 1
and T = 1 are used. The black solid curve denotes the analytic
result (27).

found that the original TUR on the work current can be broken
due to a magnetic field. To find a correct uncertainty relation,
we should take account of the effect of a velocity-dependent
force, since the magnetic field induces a Lorentz force.
To check the generalized TUR, we consider the same system studied by Chun et al. [26]. Suppose that a charged Brownian particle is trapped in a harmonic potential with stiffness
k and immersed in a reservoir with temperature T . The particle moves in a two-dimensional space, and its position and
velocity are denoted by x = (x1 , x2 ) and v = (v1 , v2 ), respectively. The Lorentz force (Bv2, −Bv1) and a nonconservative
rotational force (κx2 , −κx1 ) are applied to the particle. Then,
the equation of motion can be written as
ẋ1 = v1 , mv̇1 = Bv2 − kx1 + κx2 − γv1 + ξ1 ,
ẋ2 = v2 , mv̇2 = −Bv1 − kx2 − κx1 − γv2 + ξ2 .

(30)

In this dynamics, the total forces are F1 = Bv2 − kx1 + κx2
and F2 = −Bv1 − kx2 − κx1 . We choose the reversible part
of Fi as F1rev = F1 and F2rev = F2 , with the irreversible parts
F1ir = 0 and F2ir = 0. Then, we get F1 = 2F1 and F2 = 2F2 .
With this choice, the irreversible current (7) simply becomes
the heat current [47, 51] and the EP rate is given by
σs = −

where Q̇i = (−γvi + ξi ) ◦ vi is the heat current in the i-th direction. The second equality of Eq. (31) comes from the fact
hQ̇i is = γ(T/m−hv2is ) [51, 53] which can be straightforwardly
shown by using the Stratonovich multiplication.
For evaluating the boundary term Ω, we need to know the
distribution function Pss (x, v). For this purpose, we rewrite
Eq. (30) in the form of a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck pro-

Quv,∞ (W mag ) for many parameter sets of (κ0 , B0, m0 ) and

plot them in Fig. 2. As shown in the figure, Quv,∞ (W mag )
satisfies our bound (20). However, it seems that the lowest
bound is not reachable at all in this case; the minimum
mag
value of Quv,∞ (W mag ) is about ∼ 100, which indicates that
mag

Quv,∞ (W ) provides a very loose (so not much useful)
bound in this system. For comparison, we also plot the values

Qori,∞ (W mag ) ≥ 2 for Bκ < 0, but does not hold for Bκ > 0.
We remark that the original TUR is valid for all parameter
regions when we take the Lorentz force as the irreversible one.
In this case, the EP rate includes an extra positive unconventional term σunc

Active matter

We consider an overdamped ‘self-propelled’ or ‘active’ particle moving along a one-dimensional ring. The dynamics
of an active particle is sometimes described by the active
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (AOUP) [44, 45], which is given
by
ẋ = −µ∂ x Φ + fnc + η,

(46)

where µ is the mobility, Φ is a potential applied to the particle, fnc is an applied nonconservative force, and η is a colored
noise satisfying hη(t)η(0)i = (D/τ)e−|t|/τ. In the AOUP description, the evolution of η is simply described by
τη̇ = −η +

√
2Dξ,

(47)

where τ is the persistence time and ξ is a white Gaussian noise
satisfying hξ(t)ξ(t′ )i = δ(t − t′ ). This overdamped motion with
a colored noise can be written in the form of an underdamped
dynamics. By introducing the auxiliary velocity v ≡ ẋ and
mass m ≡ τ/µ, we have [44, 45]
mv̇ = −∂ x Ψ − τv∂2x Φ + γ fnc + m f˙nc − γv +

p

2γT ξ,

(48)

where Ψ = Φ + τ∂t Φ , γ ≡ 1/µ, and the auxiliary temperature by T ≡ D/µ. Equation (48) describes the underdamped motion of a Brownian particle with an external force
F = −∂ x Ψ − τv∂2x Φ + γ fnc + m f˙nc in a reservoir with temperature T . As F depends on velocity v, the effect of a velocitydependent force should be considered for the uncertainty relation.
Here, we test our generalized TUR with a tilted periodic

of which the detailed derivation is presented in Appendix B.
It is not possible to proceed to calculate the TUR factor
analytically with the periodic potential. For simplicity, we
first consider the case of Φ = 0, where all calculations can
be done analytically, but there is no velocity-dependent force.
The auxiliary underdamped equation of motion, Eq. (48), becomes
p
ẋ = v, mv̇ = γ f − γv + 2γT ξ.
(52)

Here, we take F = γ f = F rev and F ir = 0, thus F = 2F. By
making a change of variables as V = v − f and
p X = x − f t,
Eq. (52) becomes Ẋ = V and mV̇ = −γV + 2γT ξ, which
describes a Brownian motion without an external force. Thus,
it is straightforward to calculate hvis = f , hxis = f T , hv2 is =
f 2 + T/m, and hx2 is = f 2 T 2 + 2T T /γ from the facts hVis = 0,
hXis = 0, hV 2 is = T/m, and hX 2 is = 2T T /γ. In addition, the
EP rate is σs = γ f hvis /T = √
γ f 2 /T and the steady-state distriss
bution function is P (v) = m/(2πT ) exp[−m(v − f )2 /(2T )].
Using these results, Σuv of the active matter becomes

which is always larger than 2. The lowest bound is reachable
in the limit of both T and f → ∞.
For nonzero Φ, we perform numerical simulations. For
convenience, we first reduce the number of parameters of the
system by rescaling the units of length, time, and energy. To
this end, we introduce the dimensionless variables
x0 ≡

(57)

√
and ξ0 (t0 ) ≡ τξ(t) satisfying hξ0 (t0 )ξ0 (t0′ )i = δ(t0 −t0′ ). Equations (46) and (47) are then written in terms of the dimensionless variables and parameters as
∂t0 x0 = −µ0 ∂ x0 Φ0 + f0 + η0 ,

(58)

and
∂t0 η0 = −η0 +

2µ0 ξ0 ,

(59)

where µ0 ≡ (n/L)2 τT µ, f0 ≡ nτ f /L, and Φ0 ≡ Φ/T =
(A0 /2π) sin(2πx0 ) with A0 = LA/(nT ). Thus, the system is
characterized by the three dimensionless parameters, µ0 , f0 ,
and A0 . We numerically integrate the underdamped equations, Eqs. (58) and (59), using the second-order integrator [55]. Note that the boundary term Ω cannot be calculated without knowing the explicit form of the steady-state
distribution pss (x, v). Thus, we consider the infinite-time limit
(T → ∞), where the boundary term can be neglected. We
then calculate hẆ am is and the diffusion coefficient Dam
W =
limT →∞ Var[W am ]/(2T ) via extrapolation from 105 different
trajectories.
The results are presented in Fig. 3. As shown in the figure,
am
Qam
uv,∞ (W ) satisfies the bound (20). When A0 = 0, the numerical data are consistent with our analytic result (56). For
am
all parameter spaces, it seems that Qam
uv,∞ (W ) is a monotonically decreasing function of f0 and a monotonically increasing
function of µ0 and A0 . Furthermore, as the effect of A0 becomes negligible for large f [59], it is expected that all curves
can be fitted by Eq. (56) and saturate to the bound 2 in the
large f limit.

IV.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In summary, we derived a generalized TUR for underdamped Langevin dynamics with a velocity-dependent force
by extending the theory of Vu and Hasegawa [25], and showed
that a velocity-dependent force only changes the form of the
dynamical activity function, compared to the case without a
velocity-dependent force. In particular, our bound does not
depend on the choice of reversible and irreversible forces,
in sharp contrast to the original TUR [1] and the modified
TUR [25], where the bounds are dependent on the choice of
reversible force in the presence of velocity-dependent forces.
We examine our bound in the context of three important
systems pertaining to a velocity-dependent force: a molecular
refrigerator, Brownian motion in a magnetic field, and active
matter. In each case, we calculate the original and our TUR

FIG. 3. The TUR factor Q as a function of the dimensionless force
f0 in the infinite-time limit for the active matter system for various µ0
and A0 . Circles, triangles, and squares denote the numerical results
for µ0 = 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. Symbols with no line (red),
dotted line (blue), and dashed line (cyan) represent A0 = 0, A0 =

for the work fluctuations and show that our TUR always holds,
whereas the previously known TURs do not.
In the original TUR, the equality when the TUR factor
reaches the bound is attained when the distribution is Gaussian [59]. Thus, the lowest bound is reached on approaching
the reversible limit. However, in the case of our generalized
TUR, the equality is not simply attained on reaching the reversible limit. Instead, certain system-dependent specific limits are necessary to obtain the lowest bound. Moreover, it
seems that the lowest bound is not achievable for some systems, e.g., a Brownian particle in a magnetic field. Thus, in
these cases, our bound becomes loose.
Finally, we comment on the uncertainty relation derived
from the fluctuation theorems. Hasegawa and Vu [60] recently
presented another type of TUR, as follows:
Var[Θ]
2
≥ ∆S
,
hΘi2
e tot − 1

(60)

where they assume that the detailed fluctuation theorem is satisfied for ∆S tot (EP during the time interval T ), and the current
Θ is antisymmetric under time-reversal operation of a trajectory, that is, Θ[Γ] = −Θ[Γ† ]. This TUR is known to be valid
for time-discrete Markov chains and time-dependent driving
with a periodic and time-symmetric protocol [8, 60]. In the
molecular-refrigerator case, the work current is symmetric under time reversal, such that the above TUR cannot be applied.
In addition, the above TUR provides an exponentially loose
bound for the long-time limit, whereas our TUR constrains
the relative fluctuations linearly.
