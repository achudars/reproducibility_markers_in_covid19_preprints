ABSTRACT
The luminous blue variable (LBV) RMC 143 is located in the outskirts of the 30 Doradus complex, a region rich with interstellar
material and hot luminous stars. We report the 3σ sub-millimetre detection of its circumstellar nebula with ALMA. The observed
morphology in the sub-millimetre is different than previously observed with HST and ATCA in the optical and centimetre wavelength
regimes. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of RMC 143 suggests that two emission mechanisms contribute to the sub-mm
emission: optically thin bremsstrahlung and dust. Both the extinction map and the SED are consistent with a dusty massive nebula
with a dust mass of 0.055 ± 0.018 M⊙ (assuming κ850 = 1.7 cm2 g−1 ). To date, RMC 143 has the most dusty LBV nebula observed
in the Magellanic Clouds. We have also re-examined the LBV classification of RMC 143 based on VLT/X-shooter spectra obtained
in 2015/16 and a review of the publication record. The radiative transfer code CMFGEN is used to derive its fundamental stellar
parameters. We find an effective temperature of ∼ 8500 K, luminosity of log(L/L⊙ ) = 5.32, and a relatively high mass-loss rate of
1.0 × 10−5 M⊙ yr−1 . The luminosity is much lower than previously thought, which implies that the current stellar mass of ∼ 8 M⊙
is comparable to its nebular mass of ∼ 5.5 M⊙ (from an assumed gas-to-dust ratio of 100), suggesting that the star has lost a large
fraction of its initial mass in past LBV eruptions or binary interactions. While the star may have been hotter in the past, it is currently
not hot enough to ionize its circumstellar nebula. We propose that the nebula is ionized externally by the hot stars in the 30 Doradus
star-forming region.

1. Introduction
Luminous blue variables (LBVs), also known as S Doradus variables, are evolved massive stars that exhibit instabilities that are
not yet understood (Conti 1984, 1997; Humphreys & Davidson
1994; Nota & Lamers 1997, and references therein). The LBV
phenomenon is observed at luminosities above log(L/L⊙ ) ∼ 5.2,
corresponding to stars with initial masses of & 20 M⊙ . LBVs experience outbursts with enhanced mass loss during which they
appear to make transitions in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram from their quiescent hot state (Teff ∼ 12 000 − 30 000 K) to
lower temperatures (Teff ∼ 8 000 K). Outbursts with visual magnitude variations of 1–2 mag are referred to as classical LBV
outbursts. During giant eruptions the visual magnitude increases
by more than 2 mag. Examples of stars that have experienced
a giant eruption in our Galaxy are P Cygni in the 17th century
(e.g. de Groot 1988; Lamers & de Groot 1992) and η Car in the
1840s (reaching MV ∼ −13, e.g. Davidson & Humphreys 1997,
2012; Smith & Frew 2011).
LBVs are considered to be stars in transition to the WolfRayet (WR) stage (e.g. Langer et al. 1994; Groh et al. 2014, and

ref. therein). However, recent observational and theoretical work
suggests that some LBVs could be the immediate progenitors
of supernovae (e.g. Kotak & Vink 2006; Trundle et al. 2008;
Gal-Yam & Leonard 2009; Smith et al. 2007, 2008; Groh et al.
2013; Groh 2014; Boian & Groh 2018). Most of the fundamental questions about the physical cause of the LBV instability remain unsolved. Hypotheses for the mechanism involve radiation pressure instabilities, turbulent pressure instabilities, vibrations and dynamical instabilities, and binarity (see
Humphreys & Davidson 1994 for an overview). The high stellar luminosities near the Eddington limit probably enable instabilities (several processes in the literature are summarized in
Vink & de Koter 2002; Owocki 2015; Guzik & Lovekin 2014).
The impact of binarity has received much attention lately
(Gallagher 1989; Kashi 2010; Kashi & Soker 2010; Smith 2011;
Boffin et al. 2016). Binary scenarios for the formation of LBVs
have been proposed. LBVs may be mass gainers that received a kick when the primary exploded or the product of
a merger (e.g. Justham et al. 2014; Smith & Tombleson 2015a;
Portegies Zwart & van den Heuvel 2016). However, the massArticle number, page 1 of 14

gainer scenario presented by Smith & Tombleson (2015a), on
the basis of the apparent isolation of LBVs relative to massive star clusters, has been highly debated in the literature (e.g.
Humphreys et al. 2016).

LBVs are surrounded by massive circumstellar nebulae
of dust and gas, rich in processed material, indicative of
stellar mass ejected by an evolved object through extensive stellar winds and outbursts. Representative examples
in our Galaxy are the enigmatic η Car (e.g. Morse et al.
1998; Smith et al. 2003; Smith 2013; Morris et al. 2017),
AG Car (e.g. Thackeray 1950; Vamvatira-Nakou et al. 2015),
HR Car (Hutsemekers & van Drom 1991; Umana et al. 2009;
Buemi et al. 2017), WRAY 15-751 (Hutsemekers & van Drom
1991; Vamvatira-Nakou et al. 2013), AFGL 2298 (Ueta et al.
2001; Umana et al. 2005; Buemi et al. 2010), and the candidate LBVs HD168625 (Umana et al. 2010, and ref.
therein), G79.29+0.46 (Rizzo et al. 2008; Umana et al.
2011a; Agliozzo et al. 2014; Rizzo et al. 2014), G26.47+0.02
(Clark et al. 2003; Umana et al. 2012; Paron et al. 2012), and
the Pistol Star (Figer et al. 1999; Lang et al. 1999; Lau et al.
2014). The common presence of a N-enriched or dusty circumstellar nebula around LBVs allows the identification of
candidate LBVs (e.g. Humphreys & Davidson 1994; Nota et al.
1995; van Genderen 2001; Weis 2003), even if there is a lack of
evidence of S Doradus variability. The discovery of an infrared
ring nebula around Wray 17-96, identified by Egan et al. (2002)
as a candidate LBV based on the mid-IR properties of the ejecta,
is particularly important. Subsequently, the number of candidate
LBVs increased considerably with mid-IR surveys carried out in
the following years (Clark et al. 2005; Gvaramadze et al. 2010;
Wachter et al. 2011; Flagey et al. 2014; Nowak et al. 2014).

Kochanek (2011) show that the physical requirement of dust
condensation and growth in LBV ejecta (i.e. particle growth rate
larger than grain photoevaporation rate) is met only for very high
mass-loss rates (> 10−2.5 M⊙ yr−1 ). Such high mass-loss rates
occur during LBV giant eruptions, when the stars form a cool
(∼ 7000 K) and optically thick pseudo-photosphere that shields
the dust from the soft UV photons and favours collisional particle growth with its high densities. Dust can also form close to
periastron passage in colliding wind WC binaries, like in the case
of HD 193793 (see Crowther 2007 for a review on dust formation in WR stars). A signature of wind-wind interaction with a
companion star is a dusty ‘pinwheel’ nebula (Tuthill et al. 2008).
Interestingly, a dusty spiral nebula has been observed in the binary LBV HR Car (Boffin et al. 2016; Buemi et al. 2017).

In the last few years, Spitzer and Herschel observations have
been critical to map the dust distribution in Galactic LBV nebulae, often suggesting episodic mass-loss events or revealing the
presence of a photo-dissociation region (e.g. Umana et al. 2009,
2011b). Mapping the dust in LBV nebulae at lower metallicities,
such as in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), has not been possible so far, because of the limited angular resolution of available
infrared (IR) instrumentation. With the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), we can for the first time map the dust of
LBV nebulae in nearby galaxies in the sub-millimetre (sub-mm)
bands.

2. The LBV status of RMC 143 and its
circumstellar nebula
Is RMC 143 an LBV?
RMC 1431 is classified as one of only eight confirmed LBVs
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; Richardson & Mehner
2018). The star lies in the outskirts of the 30 Doradus (hereafter 30 Dor) star-forming region (Walborn & Blades 1997).
Parker et al. (1993) classified the star as an LBV. The authors
note photometric variations of at least 1.4 mag in V band. Spectroscopic observations indicate that the star changed from spectral type F5 to F8 in the 1950s, became as hot as an O9.5 star in
1981/85, before moving back to cooler temperatures and appearing as a late-B supergiant in 1992.
The original LBV classification of RMC 143 by Parker et al.
(1993) is questionable as the large change in V -band photometry
reported for 1981/85 and associated change in spectral type to
late-O and also the F-type classifications in the 1950s and 1983
may be due to a misidentification of the star (Figure 1):
1. There has been confusion in the literature between RMC 143
and HD 2699292. In particular, Parker et al. (1993) state
that HD 269929 is an alternative designation for RMC 143.
HD 269929 has a V -band magnitude of 12.2 mag and shows
no significant brightness variation between 2000-2009 in the
All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS; Pojmanski 1997). The
star is classified as F8 (SIMBAD; Cannon 1936), which
matches the classification of RMC 143 in the 1950s and
1983.
2. Melnick (1985) classify stars in the centre of 30 Dor based on
spectra obtained in 1983. They assign a spectral type F7Ia, in
contradiction with the O-type star classification in 1981/85
of Parker et al. (1993). Their figure 1 identifies the correct
star as RMC 143.
3. Clayton & Martin (1985) exclude RMC 143 from their stellar sample to study interstellar dust in the LMC, as they were
aware that different observers had observed two or three different stars.
4. The 1992 June International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE)
spectrum is consistent with a B8–9I star (Parker et al. 1993).
From the FES image of the IUE a V-band magnitude of
10.9 mag is estimated.
5. Walborn et al. (2017) report spectroscopic changes between
the spectral types A and late-B in the time span from 1998 to
2016.
6. Photometry variations on time scales of several weeks
and of the order of 0.5 mag are observed in the ASAS
lightcurve in the early 2000s. The All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) lightcurve shows no significant variations between 2014–2018 (Kochanek et al. 2017;
Jayasinghe et al. 2018).
Unfortunately, the pre-1990 observations are not available to
us. The F-type stellar classifications prior to 1990 may be observations of HD 269929 and the O-star classification in the early
1980s may also belong to observations of another star. However, the documented spectroscopic variations in Walborn et al.
(2017) and the massive nebula (this work) both support an LBV
classification. Given the star’s relatively low luminosity for an
LBV, small spectroscopic variabilities would be expected following the amplitude-luminosity relation of S Doradus variables
(Wolf 1989).

The circumstellar nebula of RMC 143

3. Observations
3.1. ALMA

The identification of a circumstellar nebula around RMC 143 is
difficult due to its location within the 30 Dor HII region. Feast
(1961) noticed several nebular filaments, extending to an angular
scale of 15′′ . Smith et al. (1998) analysed the velocity field and
abundances of these filaments and attributed them to the 30 Dor
complex. Only a compact region up to about 2′′ from the star
has abundances consistent with ejected stellar material during
an LBV phase.
High spatial resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images with the F656N filter show that the circumstellar material
of RMC 143 is triangular shaped and is located north-west of the
star (Weis 2003). The nebula is elongated with an extent of 4.9′′
(about 1.2 pc) and oriented north to south-west. Its shape is very
unusual and raises the speculation that strong stellar winds or
turbulent motion in the HII region caused its disruption. Highdispersion optical spectra confirm the presence of a nebula with
two velocity components.
Agliozzo et al. (2012) presented the first radio observations
of RMC 143, performed with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) in Band 4cm. The resolution with the 6-km array configuration varied between 1.5′′ and 2.5′′ , depending on
the central observing frequency (9 GHz and 5.5 GHz, respectively). This allowed to detect the radio counterpart of the optical nebula, which is ionized and emits in the radio by free-free
transitions (bremsstrahlung emission). At 9 GHz, an unresolved
source at the position of the star was detected. Comparing the
radio and Hα flux densities, which trace the same gas, led to the
conclusion that the optical nebula suffers intrinsic extinction due
to dust.
In this paper, we present sub-mm/radio observations of
RMC 143 with ALMA and ATCA and optical spectra with Xshooter at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We perform a multiwavelength study and compare our data to archival optical
HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) images
and IR photometry. We interpret the nature of the ALMA submillimetre emission.

RMC 143 was observed with ALMA on 26 December 2014 as
part of a Cycle-2 project (2013.1.00450.S, PI Agliozzo). During
the observations, forty 12 m antennas were used with an integration time of 16 min. A standard Band 7 continuum spectral
setup was used, resulting in four 2-GHz width spectral windows
of 128 channels of XX and YY polarization correlations centred
at approximately 336.5 (LSB), 338.5 (LSB), 348.5 (USB), and
350.5 GHz (USB). Atmospheric conditions were marginal for
the combination of frequency and high airmass (transit elevation
is 45◦ for RMC 143 at the ALMA site). Non-standard calibration steps were required to minimize image degradation due to
phase smearing, to provide correct flux calibration, and to maximize sensitivity by allowing inclusion of shadowed antennas.
Further discussion of these techniques and general aspects of
observations and data reduction can be found in Agliozzo et al.
(2017b). We derived the intensity image from naturally weighted
visibilities to maximize sensitivity and image quality (minimize
the impact of phase errors on the longer baselines). We imaged all spectral windows together (343.5 GHz average; approximately 7.5 GHz usable bandwidth), yielding an rms noise of
72 µ Jy beam−1.3 In Figure 2 we show the 2, 3, and 4σ contour
levels of the emission. The lowest contour does not have strong
statistical significance, but appears to partially overlap with the
Hα emission. Deeper observations with ALMA would improve
the image quality.
3.2. ATCA
We performed ATCA observations of RMC 143 between 20 and
23 January 2012, using the array in the most extended configuration (6 km) and the Compact Array Broadband Backend (CABB)
“15 mm” receiver in continuum mode. RMC 143 was observed
at different hour angles distributed over three days, alternating
with the phase calibrator ICRF J052930.0−724528. The observations were performed in marginal weather conditions, which
3 The originally desired rms noise of 40 µ Jy beam−1 was not achieved
because only one third of the required observations were completed.

may have caused a loss of coherence at the long baselines (small
angular scales in the sky). For each source we split the receiver
bandwidth in two 2-GHz sub-bands, one centred at 17 GHz and
one at 23 GHz. The two data sets were reduced separately. Details on the observing strategy and data reduction can be found
in Agliozzo et al. (2017a,b). Information on the final images, obtained by adopting the natural weighting scheme of the visibilities, can be found in Table 1. The table also lists information
about the synthesized beam (Half Power Beam Width, HPBW),
position angle (PA), largest angular scale (LAS), peak flux density, and rms-noise.
At 17 GHz, we detect above 3σ the nebular emission in its
whole optical extent. At 23 GHz, the map is noisy because of the
system response to bad weather at higher frequencies and we did
not detect with statistical significance emission associated with
RMC 143. We thus do not show the 23 GHz data.
We include in our analysis the 5.5 and 9 GHz data from
the ATCA observations performed in 2011 with the CABB
“4cm-Band” (4–10.8 GHz) receiver, described in Agliozzo et al.
(2012) and shown in Figure 2. At these frequencies the HII region is bright and causes confusion. To mitigate artefacts due

to the secondary lobes from bright sources in the region, we reprocessed the data and filtered out the uv spacings smaller than
∼ 17 kλ , in order to match the LAS of the 17-GHz data. This
operation degrades the image quality and the rms-noise. In Table 1, the LAS and beam information at 5.5 and 9 GHz refer to
the newly processed maps, which are used to derive the spatiallyintegrated flux density.
3.3. VLT/X-shooter
RMC 143 was observed with X-shooter at the VLT on 2 October
2015 and 12 January 2016 (ESO programme 096.D-0047(A), PI
Mehner). X-shooter is a medium-resolution echelle spectrograph
that simultaneously observes the wavelength region from 3 000–
24 800 Å with three arms (Vernet et al. 2011). Spectra were obtained with the narrowest available slits of 0′′.5 in the UVB arm,
0′′.4 in the VIS arm, and 0′′.4 in the NIR arm yielding spectral resolving powers of R ∼ 9 000 − 17 000. Spectra obtained with the
5′′ slits provide us the means to achieve absolute flux calibrations
to ∼ 20% accuracy. However, the large aperture includes nebular reflection. The data were reduced with the ESO X-shooter

4. The stellar parameters and atmosphere
abundances of RMC 143
Many emission lines form in the dense stellar winds of LBVs
and veil the underlying photospheric spectrum. Complex radiative transfer models, which include the necessary physics to
study the radiation transport across the atmosphere and wind, are
needed to obtain realistic parameters. We compare the X-shooter
spectra of RMC 143 obtained in 2015 with atmosphere models computed with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN (version 5may17, Hillier & Miller 1998), which has been successfully applied to several LBVs (e.g. Hillier et al. 2001; Groh et al.

2006, 2009, 2011; Clark et al. 2009, 2012; Georgiev et al. 2011;
Mehner et al. 2017). For a review on the essential properties of
the code and the basics of spectroscopic analysis of massive stars
using photospheric and wind diagnostics, see Groh (2011) and
Martins (2011).
The diagnostics to find the best-fitting stellar model for
RMC 143 are similar to those described in Mehner et al. (2017),
except for the effective temperature. This quantity is constrained
based on the equivalent widths of the Mg II λ 4481 and Mg I
λ 5183 lines. The value of Teff is supported by He I λ 4713, He I
λ 5876, photospheric Fe II lines, and the emission components of
Fe II lines formed in the wind. The mass-loss rate is constrained
based on the emission components of Fe II and H Balmer lines.
We note that in this parameter regime, the strength of the H emission lines is extremely sensitive on the effective temperature and
temperature structure of the wind. The luminosity of RMC 143
is constrained based on the absolute flux calibration of the Xshooter spectrum used to constrain the other stellar parameters.
Since RMC 143 is a variable star, we consider this more reliable
than using broad-band photometry obtained at different epochs.
Figures 3, 4, and 5 compare the 2015 X-shooter spectrum of
RMC 143 with our best-fit CMFGEN model. The derived stellar
parameters for its quiescent state are listed in Table 2. We find an
effective temperature of Teff = 8 500 ± 300 K and a stellar luminosity of log(L/L⊙ ) = 5.32 ± 0.05 (Mbol = −8.56 mag). We note

that the value of Teff derived from the Mg I/Mg II line ratio does
not provide enough free electrons in the wind, which are needed
for producing the electron scattering wings clearly visible in the
H recombination lines. In addition, the H ionization structure
seems to require a slightly higher value of Teff . In this parameter
range, our models show that a small increase of Teff (by 500800 K) would be enough for producing stronger H emission and
broader electron scattering wings. We still prefer to give higher
weight to the Mg I/Mg II, since these lines are formed deeper in
the wind. Our interpretation is that the H ionization structure is
not fully reproduced by our models, and is likely affected by
time-dependent effects that are inherent to LBVs (Groh & Vink
2011).
Our derived value of log(L/L⊙ ) = 5.32 is lower than the
most commonly-used estimate (log(L/L⊙ ) = 5.7), which was
suggested by Parker et al. (1993). However, our luminosity value
is in line with the estimate from Walborn & Blades (1997), who
originally suggested that R143 had an initial single-star mass
around 25 − 30 M⊙ . The two most likely possibilities are that
(1) Parker et al. (1993) misidentified RMC 143 (see Section 2),
or (2) RMC 143 had a different value of luminosity and temperature around the early 1990s. Figure 6 shows the position of
RMC 143 in the HR diagram obtained from our CMFGEN modelling.
Extended emission from surrounding material is apparent in
the spectra and not all hydrogen and helium lines are matched
equally well. The estimation of the effective temperature Teff is

not affected by the nebular contamination, while the luminosity
L may be somewhat overestimated due to inclusion of reflected
or scattered nebular continuum. Since the hydrogen absorption
lines are filled in with extra emission from the surrounding nebula, we only derive a lower limit of the terminal wind velocity
v∞ > 70 km s−1.
The gravity is estimated to be log(g/[cgs]) = 0.7 and the
stellar mass to be ∼ 8 M⊙ . A mass-loss rate of Ṁ ∼ 1.0 ×
10−5 M⊙ yr−1 for a clumping factor fc equal to 1 fits the hydrogen emission well. The mass-loss rate is more affected by
the uncertain ionization structure and time dependence than
by nebular contamination since we used mainly Hβ , higher
Balmer lines, and Fe II lines to constrain it. For comparison,
the LBV W243 with a similar temperature of Teff ∼ 8500 K but
much higher luminosity has a much weaker mass-loss rate of
6.1 × 10−7 M⊙ yr−1 (Ritchie et al. 2009).
RMC 143 displays the spectrum of an LBV. In particular, the
spectrum displays no [O I] λ λ 6300,6364 emission, characteristic of the sgB[e] class (Humphreys et al. 2017). We also detect no CO first-overtone emission at 2.3 µ m, indicative that
RMC 143 has no high density circumstellar disc as is the case
for B[e] stars (McGregor et al. 1988b). RMC 143 shows signs
of CNO-processed material at the surface (Table 3), with enhanced He and N, and depleted H, C, and O. This confirms the
evolved nature of the star, especially given the low current mass
(∼ 8 M⊙ ).

4σ .
Ideally, we would like to compare the sub-mm continuum emission with far-IR images. Unfortunately, the spatial resolution of IR space telescopes is unsuitable for disentangling the contribution of the central star, the circumstellar nebula, and the interstellar dust from the total emission. For example, the Spitzer/MIPS 24 µ m image has a
resolution of ∼ 6′′ , too poor for morphological comparison
with other wavelengths. We retrieved the 8 µ m IRAC image (Meixner et al. 2006, with a resolution of ∼ 2′′ ) and subtracted the point source at the position of RMC 143 using the
tool APEX in the MOPEX package (Makovoz & Marleau 2005;
NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive et al. 2011). The pointsource subtraction worked relatively well considering the high
and not uniform background, and the residual image is sufficient for a qualitative comparison with the ALMA and ATCA
data. The spatial resolution is still poor and the central part of
the nebula may have been subtracted together with the pointsource. However, it is possible to recognise an outer asymmetric
emission that seems to overlap better with the sub-mm 343 GHz
ALMA contours than the cm 17 GHz ATCA contours (Figure 9).
Thus, the 8 µ m flux plausibly arises from the same component
responsible for the ALMA contours.

5. Morphology of the radio and sub-millimetre
emission

6. Ionized matter

RMC 143 lies south-east from the centre of the 30 Dor starforming region, the most luminous HII region in the Local
Group. The environment around RMC 143 is rich in interstellar
material and hot luminous stars and is very bright in the optical,
IR, and radio. Figure 7 shows part of the 30 Dor complex as seen
by ATCA in the 6-km configuration at 5 GHz. The LAS in this
map is ∼ 20′′ , which means that more extended radio emission
in the star-forming region is filtered out by the interferometer.
The Feast filaments (with an angular scale of ∼ 15′′ ) are not detected at 5 GHz, probably because they are too faint, although
the 2σ contour elongated toward the N-E side of the nebula suggests a partial detection of one of the filaments. At higher frequencies, the filaments would be filtered out because of the lack
of baselines for those angular scales. The Feast filaments and
RMC 143’s nebula are illustrated in the Hα image of Figure 8,
with the ALMA contours at 343 GHz overlaid.
As is the case in the optical, the nebula is also triangularshaped in the radio, with no counterpart in the east and southeast of the star (Figure 2). From the 17 GHz map, which has the
highest spatial resolution, we estimate a size (beam convolved)
of the radio emission of about 6′′ along the largest extension.
The point-source detected at 9 GHz at the position of the star is
not detected at 17 GHz, most likely because of lack of coherence
at the smallest angular scales due to high phase-rms during the
observations. The knot of bright emission visible at all radio frequencies corresponds to the nebular material 2′′ north of the star,
attributed to RMC 143 (Smith et al. 1998).
The sub-mm emission detected by ALMA has an irregular
shape and is distributed on one side of the star (Figure 8), similarly to the optical and radio emissions. However, the sub-mm
contours suggest a different morphology and thus a different nature of the emission. The sub-mm continuum emission can be
due to both free-free emission from the ionized gas and to thermal emission from dust. The slightly curved emission in the submm seems aligned with an “imaginary” extension of at least one
of the Feast filaments over RMC 143’s nebula. This is not seen
in the radio maps. A compact object at the position of the star is

The flux density of RMC 143 and the rms-noise σ is determined
from the 17 GHz radio map using the CASA viewer. For the
flux density, we integrate the nebular emission of areas above
3σ level. The rms-noise is evaluated in regions free
√ of emission
and the flux density error is estimated as ε = σ N, where N is
the number of independent beams in the selected region. Calibration errors are negligible and the uncertainty is dominated by
the noise in the maps and possible systematic under-estimated
due to the 3σ cut. We also estimate the flux densities at 5.5 and
9 GHz from the reprocessed maps (Section 3.2) to reduce the
contribution from the HII region extended emission and/or image artefacts due to zero-baseline scale missing (Table 1; compare with Agliozzo et al. 2012). In fact, both can contaminate the
nebular emission and eventually falsify the flux density analysis.
Because of the inhomogeneous background in the 5.5 and 9 GHz
maps, the flux density measurements have a larger uncertainty,
especially at 9 GHz.
The total integrated flux density encompassing the nebula
and the central object at 343 GHz is 2.5 ± 0.4 mJy (the error also
includes 10% flux uncertainty). Part of this emission probably
originates from the ionized nebula and is due to bremsstrahlung.
In fact, from the flux density at 17 GHz, the extrapolated value
at 343 GHz accounting for the free-free emission is ∼ 0.8 mJy,
about one third of the observed total flux density at 343 GHz.
We derived a spectral index map (per-pixel) between 5.5 and
17 GHz, after re-gridding the highest-resolution map (17 GHz)
to the same grid of the 5.5 GHz map and re-convolved it with a
synthesized beam that matches the resolution at 5.5 GHz, similar to Agliozzo et al. (2017a). Figure 10 shows the spectral index
map and its associated error map. Calibration errors are negligible and the error in each pixel is given by the sum in quadrature
of the rms-noise in both the maps. The weighted fit of the powerlaw Sν ∝ ν α between the flux densities at 5.5, 9, and 17 GHz
gives us a mean spectral index hα i = −0.2 ± 0.2, which is consistent with optically thin free-free emission typical of evolved
HII regions (theoretically it is Sν ∝ ν −0.1 ). The knot visible at
all the radio frequencies in the nearly-middle part of the nebula

its large brightness relative to the surrounding nebula is due to

model, at 343 GHz we would expect to observe a higher flux
density; at 9 GHz the measurement might include some nebular
flux; at 17 GHz we might have lost the detection of the point
source because of decorrelation during the observations due to
unstable weather. However, the terminal velocity v∞ determined
in Section 4 is a lower limit, thus the above flux densities must
be treated as upper limits.
It seems plausible that the sub-mm emission is due to freefree, but such a model of stationary, isothermal and spherically symmetric optically thick ionized wind may not applica-

lower than assumed, given the low effective temperature and

Agliozzo et al. (2017b) found that a collimated ionized wind
model better explains the observed SED from the near-IR to
the radio. Other measurements in between the two ALMA and
ATCA frequencies and between the near-IR and the sub-mm
would be very useful to better understand the nature of the cen-

tral object emission. Another source of emission in the sub-mm
could be dust in the wind or in a shell in front of the star.

7. The spatial distribution of dust
The Hα emission in the nebula of RMC 143 is due to the deexcitation of the recombined hydrogen atom and the radio centimetric emission is due to free-free transitions. They trace the
same gas (Agliozzo et al. 2012) and it is thus possible to determine the extinction of the Hα line by comparing the surface
brightness at optical and radio wavelengths (Pottasch 1984).
We follow the procedure described in Agliozzo et al.
(2017a). An electron temperature of 12 200 K (Smith et al.
1998) is adopted. The extinction map is derived by comparing pixel-by-pixel the highest-resolution radio image (17 GHz)
with the HST Hα image as 2.5 log(F17 GHz (obs) /F17 GHz (expected) ),
where F17 GHz (expected) is the expected radio emission from the
Hα recombination-line emission (see equations 7 and 8 in
Agliozzo et al. 2017a). This computation was performed in every common pixel with brightness above 3σ , where σ was computed by summing in quadrature the noise in the maps and calibration uncertainties. We mask the Hα emission from the star,
keeping in mind that we want to estimate the expected free-free
emission from the optical nebular line. The derived extinction
map is illustrated in Figure 11.
Relatively small extinction due to dust is evident across the
entire region. The maximum value for AHα is ∼1.06 mag and
corresponds to the knot of the radio and optical emission. This
knot is not a density clump according to the spectral index analysis and is likely the effect of material along the line of sight. The
most extinguished region is in the same direction of the ALMA
emission corresponding to the middle part of the nebula. The
ALMA emission may arise mostly from a cool dust component
that surrounds the ionized gas in the nebula and extinguishes the
optical Hα emission.

8. The SED of RMC 143
Our ALMA sub-mm observations can constrain some of the
dust properties. To understand the origin of the ALMA submm emission we compare it with the available IR photometry, which were derived from images with different spatial resolutions. We consulted the IR catalogues with the CDS VizieR
(Ochsenbein et al. 2000) and IRSA Gator4 tools. For the midand far-IR photometry we evaluated the effect of confusion on
photometry. We include photometry from the 2MASS Point
Source Catalog (Cutri et al. 2003), the Spitzer SAGE legacy
survey (Meixner et al. 2006, Data Release 3/final), the AKARI
IRC LMC survey (Kato et al. 2012; Ita et al. 2008), WISE
(Cutri et al. 2012), and Herschel PACS (Meixner et al. 2013).
We include our measurements of the ALMA Band 7 and ATCA
Bands 4cm (5.5 and 9 GHz) and 15mm (17GHz).
We have excluded the WISE W3 and W4 band photometry
due to confusion in the relatively
large effective beams (∼ 7′′ for
√
′′
W3 and ∼ 12 for W4, 2 larger in Atlas images) and the complication of the very wide W3 spectral response. The W4 band
photometry in particular is highly discrepant with the MIPS24
photometry at similar wavelength but much higher spatial resolution (5.9′′ FWHM). We consider as valid the AKARI S11
and L15 band photometry. Although the AKARI all-sky survey
does not have sufficient spatial resolution, the LMC survey was
taken in a pointed imaging mode which yields comparable resolution to MIPS24 in the L15 band and even better in the S11
band (FWHM of 5.7′′ for L15 and 4.8′′ for S11, Onaka et al.
2007). The available Herschel PACS100 and 160 band photometry is somewhat affected by confusion due to the large PSFs
(7.7′′ and 12′′ FWHM), but this appears to be well accounted
for in the large quoted error bars, and they are the only far-IR
photometry available. Unfortunately, there is no PACS70 data
for RMC 143, which would have had a better spatial resolution and been closer to the peak of the dust emission. There
is no detection by MIPS70 due to the very large beam (18′′
FWHM) and confusion. For MIPS24 we take the weighted average of the two SAGE epoch measurements of 2.974 ± 0.016 mag
and 2.913 ± 0.010 mag, that is, 2.930 mag or 482.5 mJy. Due to
the expected confusion we assume a 20% uncertainty on the
MIPS24 photometry.
We also include the photometry available in VizieR from
the UV and optical catalogues XMM-Newton, AC2000,
AAVSO, GAIA, and RAVE (Page et al. 2012; Urban et al.
1998; Henden et al. 2015; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016;
Kunder et al. 2017). We correct these data for interstellar dust
extinction, using the extinction curve from Fitzpatrick (1999),
RV = 4.0 and E(B − V ) = 0.42 mag, as determined from our
CMFGEN modelling (see Table 2). Keeping in mind that the

Fig. 12. Flux density distribution of RMC 143 from IR catalogues and our ALMA and ATCA measurements. The dust component shown is a
greybody fit to the MIPS24, PACS100, PACS160, and ALMA photometry. The grey and green bands show the ranges of values within twice
the minimum χ 2 for the dust greybody and nebula free-free fits, respectively. We note that the AKARI S11 and L15 photometry have a colour
correction applied assuming a T = 70 K, β = 1 greybody.

UV to near-IR photometry comes from observations performed
at different epochs and the star being likely variable, we can
argue that the corrected data (blue triangles in Figure 12) agree
with the CMFGEN model of a star with Teff = 8 500 ± 300 K,
log(L∗ /L⊙ ) = 5.32 at a distance of 49.97 kpc (Table 2).
The SED of RMC 143’s circumstellar material can be described with two components: 1) the ionized gas in the nebula
that can be modelled by optically thin bremsstrahlung dominating the total flux at radio wavelengths (see Section 6); 2) a dust
component that peaks in the far-IR, typical for LBV nebulae (e.g.
Hutsemekers 1997; Clark et al. 2003).
Given the limitations of the available photometry and lack of
a mid-IR spectrum, we fit only a simple single-temperature greybody (power-law opacity index β , see e.g. Backman & Paresce
1993) to model the dust and obtain an estimate of the dust mass.
As wavelengths shortward of about 20 µ m can deviate strongly
from a simple greybody due to PAH and/or silicate spectral features (typically in HII regions, but also in the nebula of the candidate LBV HD 168625, Draine & Li 2007; Compiègne et al.
2010; Umana et al. 2010) or due to several ionized gas forbidden lines (e.g. as seen in Spitzer IRS spectra of HR Car
and G79.29+0.46; Umana et al. 2009; Agliozzo et al. 2014), we
only fit the greybody to the MIPS24, PACS100+160, and ALMA
photometry. Table 4 contains a summary of the photometry used
to fit the dust. The best-fit photosphere and ionized gas freefree flux density distributions were added to the greybody for
fitting the observed photometry. The free-free contribution to the
ALMA measurement is significant at 0.47 to 1.01 mJy (limits of

twice minimum χ 2 of the free-free fit to the ATCA photometry),
assuming the free-free power-law spectrum continues without
turnover to the ALMA frequency. The uncertainty on the freefree contribution of ±0.27 mJy was added in quadrature with the
ALMA measurement error in the fit.
A dust emissivity at 850 µ m of κ850 = 1.7 cm2 g−1 and LMC
distance of 49.97 kpc are assumed. The greybody fit yields representative parameters of Tdust = 70.9 ± 8.9 K, β = 1.31 ± 0.30 and
Mdust = 0.055 ± 0.018 M⊙ . The reduced χ 2 of the fit is 1.44. This
somewhat high value appears to be mostly due to the PACS160
measurement, which we do indeed expect to be the most affected
by confusion due to having the largest beam size. The greybody
flux density distribution region within twice the minimum χ 2 is
shown as the grey band in Figure 12. The total model, including
best-fit free-free, dust greybody and photosphere is shown by the
black line (solid longward of 20 µ m where we consider the greybody meaningful). The AKARI S11 and L15 points in Figure
12 have a colour-correction applied appropriate for a T = 70 K,
β = 1 greybody (correction factors are 2.712 and 2.135, respectively, AKARI IRC Data User Manual), but they still lie significantly above the photosphere and the greybody. As previously mentioned, we expect these bands, which have a wide
bandwidth, to show evidence of silicate or PAH emission, like
in the case of the Galactic candidate LBV HD168625 (Skinner
1997; Umana et al. 2010), or several bright mid-IR ionized gas
emission lines, like in the case of HR Car and G79.29+0.46
(Umana et al. 2009, 2011a; Agliozzo et al. 2014), together with
a possible hotter thermal component. Another source of excess

at the mid-IR wavelengths could be very small grains, typically
observed in HII regions and produced by erosion of large grains
in the diffuse medium. Contribution from very small grains to
the emissivity in the far-IR and sub-mm should be negligible
(Compiègne et al. 2010) and we are not aware of their observations in LBV nebulae.
Note the departure of β from the interstellar case (β = 2):
β ∼ 1.3 implies either the existence of relatively large grains, a
significant optical depth, or a range of physical dust temperatures
(studies of Galactic objects showed that the dust temperature decreases with increasing distance from the star, e.g. Hutsemekers
1997; Buemi et al. 2017). Large grains have been found in other
LBV nebulae, such as those of AG Car (McGregor et al. 1988a;
Vamvatira-Nakou et al. 2015) and η Car (Mitchell & Robinson
1986), and in the ejecta of RSGs (e.g. Scicluna et al. 2015). The
derived temperatures are higher than typical values of interstellar
dust and also dust in evolved HII regions (Paladini et al. 2012).
The dust temperature is typical compared to other LBVs (e.g.
Hutsemekers 1997). Stars displaying the B[e] phenomenon have
higher dust temperatures of about 500–1000 K (Lamers et al.
1998). A detailed modelling of the spatially integrated SED of
η Car’s Homunculus including mid- and far-IR spectroscopy by
Morris et al. (2017) shows a very complex chemical composition
of the dusty ejecta. Unfortunately, the current data of RMC 143
preclude us to derive a more detailed model. Note that RMC 143
has a significant fraction of ionized gas, while the Homunculus
is mostly neutral, so the mid-IR spectrum might be different in
the two objects.

9. The nebular mass and initial mass
The sub-mm emission detected with ALMA presents a different
morphology than the optical and radio emission, although the
contours have low statistical significance due to the low signalto-noise ratio. The sub-mm emission on the north-east side of the
nebula may be aligned with the interstellar filaments associated
with 30 Dor. An analysis of the data shows that: 1) at least twothirds of the integrated sub-mm flux density is due to dust that
extinguishes the Hα emission in-homogeneously across the nebula; 2) dust temperatures and parameter β values are consistent
with processed material in LBV nebulae rather than with ISM
dust.
The dust mass derived in the previous Section is to date the
largest value found in an LBV nebula at sub-solar metallicities.
Only a few studies on dust in the MCs LBVs have been performed, see Table 5. A study to address the contribution of LBVs
to dust production at the LMC and SMC metallicities is ongoing
(Agliozzo et al., in prep).
The gas-to-dust ratio G/D is an unknown parameter in LBVs.
Because of favourable physical conditions in LBV eruptions, this
parameter may be lower than in the ISM. Roman-Duval et al.
Article number, page 12 of 14

(2014) report a G/D of ∼ 400 in the LMC diffuse atomic ISM,
although they find that in dense regions this might be lower
(G/D ∼ 200). Assuming the lower value as representative of
the 30 Dor region and the dust mass derived in this work, we
find a total nebular mass MTOT for RMC 143 of 11.0 ± 3.7 M⊙ ,
and assuming G/D=100 (more representative of our Galaxy)
MTOT = 5.5 ± 1.8 M⊙ .
In Agliozzo et al. (2012), we derived an approximate ionized
mass of ∼ 0.5 − 0.9 M⊙ . Although the ionized mass estimate
is dependent on the assumed volume for the nebula (which is
not easy to determine because of the nebula’s irregular shape), it
seems plausible that a large gas mass is not ionized and is located
in a photo-dissociation region around the ionized nebula, mixed
with the dust. The total nebular mass has an order of magnitude
uncertainty, due mostly to the uncertainty of the gas to dust ratio
and of the assumed dust emissivity, κ850.
The stellar parameters of RMC 143 suggest that the star’s
location in the HR diagram is at the lower luminosity end of
LBVs. Our derived luminosity (log(L/L⊙ ) = 5.32) suggests a
single-star initial mass around 25 − 30 M⊙ . Given that the CMFGEN models suggest a (spectroscopic) current mass of ∼ 8 M⊙ ,
it appears that RMC 143 has lost a large fraction of its initial
mass. RMC 143’s position in the HR diagram is similar to that
of the Yellow Hypergiant (YHG) Hen3-1379, a post-Red Supergiant (RSG) star on its way to the LBV phase, as argued
by Lagadec et al. (2011) and Hutsemékers et al. (2013). Further
analysis would be needed to draw firm conclusions on whether
the nebula was ejected during binary interaction, or LBV eruptions, or during a previous RSG phase. In particular, nebular
abundances would need to be compared to numerical stellar evolution models of single and binary stars. Beasor & Davies (2018)
discussed the uncertainties of RSG mass-loss rates along the evolutionary sequence of a 16 M⊙ star, showing that such a RSG
star loses a small fraction (∼ 0.6 M⊙ ) of its mass through stellar
winds. However, no similar observational estimate exists for the
more massive RSGs that RMC 143 could have evolved from.
In light of our revised low luminosity of RMC 143, an interesting avenue for future study would be a re-appraisal of the
evolutionary status of RMC 143 in comparison to its nearby environment (Smith & Tombleson 2015b; Humphreys et al. 2016;
Aadland et al. 2018). Aghakhanloo et al. (2017) developed models of passive dissolution of young stellar clusters, and concluded
that LBV environments are inconsistent with them evolving from
single stars. It would be interesting to investigate the behaviour
of RMC 143 given its relatively low current and initial mass that
we derived in this paper.

10. The ionizing source of RMC 143’s nebula
The quiescent temperature of RMC 143 over the past ∼ 60 yr
suggests that the star is not hot enough to ionize its extended
nebula. Although we cannot exclude a hotter phase for RMC 143
in the past, the observations suggest that an external ionizing
source may be responsible for the ionization of its nebula. This
was also proposed for the circumstellar nebulae of the Pistol Star
(Figer et al. 1999) and IRAS 18576+0341 (Buemi et al. 2010).
The nearby star-forming region 30 Dor contains > 700 massive stars (Doran et al. 2013), with a large fraction of them forming the well-known RMC 136 cluster. 30 Dor’s giant nebula is
ionized and detected at radio wavelengths (Figure 7). Melnick
(1985) conclude that a large fraction of the ionization of 30 Dor
is provided by the UV photon budget produced by the early-type
stars, WR stars, and blue supergiants within 25 pc of the cluster

Agliozzo et al.: A massive nebula around the LBV RMC 143 revealed by ALMA

centre. Doran et al. (2013) estimate the feedback of hot luminous stars in 30 Dor from a census of hot stars within 150 pc
of RMC 136 obtained by the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey
(Evans et al. 2011).
We use the ionizing photon luminosities in Doran et al. to
derive an order of magnitude estimate of the Strömgren radius at different distances from RMC 136. In particular, we
use the cumulative UV photon fluxes for the sample that includes the Grand Total of stars with spectroscopic classification from their Table 9. We derive the Strömgren radius as
RS = (3 × SUV /(4π n2e β2 ))1/3 , where β 2 = 3 × 10−13 cm3 s−1 (for
typical ISM electron temperatures of ∼ 10 000 K) and SUV is the
UV photon flux per second, in the simplifying assumption that
the gas is mostly hydrogen.
Accounting for only the stars within 5 pc from the cluster centre, the integrated UV photon flux in Doran et al. is
576 × 1049 ph s−1 . The Strömgren radius decreases with the
plasma density ne as ne −2/3 . Thus, for two orders of magnitudes of plasma densities in the ISM and in star-forming regions, 30 cm−3 and 300 cm−3, RS varies between 56 and 12 pc,
respectively. The UV photon flux in the 30 Dor region doubles
if stars at larger distances from the cluster centre are taken into
account (up to a projected distance of 150 pc). For a total of
1056 × 1049 ph s−1 , RS varies from about 15 pc (for densities
of 300 cm−3) to 68 pc (for densities of 30 cm−3). RMC 143 has
a projected distance of about 32 pc from RMC 136. Although
we are considering projected distances, it seems plausible that
RMC 143’s nebula is ionized by an external ionizing source.
In addition, Doran et al. (2013) estimate that about 6% of
the ionizing photons escape the region, although with large uncertainty. This implies that all hydrogen inside the region is
in ionization equilibrium, including plausibly RMC 143’s circumstellar nebula. A similar scenario ("inverted" photoionization; Schuster et al. 2009) was outlined to explain the asymmetric HII region associated with the Red Supergiant NML Cyg
(Habing et al. 1982; Morris & Jura 1983; Schuster et al. 2006).
This phenomenon is also found in the YHGs and RSGs of
the Westerlund 1 cluster in our Galaxy (Dougherty et al. 2010;
Fenech et al. 2018; Andrews et al. 2018).

11. Summary and conclusions
We report the discovery of a massive dusty component in the
nebula around LBV RMC 143, through resolved sub-mm observations performed with ALMA. The dust mass inferred from the
available space telescope IR photometry and from the ALMA
Band 7 observations is 0.055 ± 0.018 M⊙ assuming κ850 =
1.7 cm2 g−1 , a distance of 49.97 kpc, and an average dust temperature of ∼ 70 K. The representative dust temperature is derived
from a modified grey-body that best fits the MIPS24, PACS100,
PACS160, and ALMA 850 µ m photometry (integrated over the
entire nebula). An additional mid-IR excess is seen in the broadband AKARI S11 and L15 photometry, which could be due to a
combination of emission lines from the ionized gas, silicate, and
PAH emission bands.
We compare the ALMA dust detection with the 8 µ m Spitzer
and the Hα HST images, and with the 5.5, 9, and 17 GHz ATCA
maps. The morphological comparison and the extinction map
suggest that the dust is distributed in a photo-dissociation region
partially surrounding the ionized nebula.
The historical light curve of RMC 143 and the past literature
show that the previous LBV classification was likely the result
of a mis-identification with another star. However, despite the

possible lack of evidence of S Doradus cycles, the massive circumstellar nebula and the stellar parameters support the LBV
classification. RMC 143 is at the lower luminosity end of LBVs
(log(L/L⊙) = 5.32), with an effective temperature in 2015 of
∼ 8 500 K. The star may be in outburst phase for the last three
decades, which would also explain the relatively high mass-loss
rate of 1.0 × 10−5 M⊙ yr−1 . The stellar wind is enhanced in He
and N, and depleted in H, C, and O, confirming the evolved nature of the star. RMC 143 is currently not hot enough to ionize
its circumstellar nebula. While the star may have been hotter in
the past, the nebula could be kept in ionization equilibrium by
the UV photons escaping the 30 Dor star-forming region.
The current stellar mass in our best-fit CMFGEN model is
∼ 8 M⊙ , which is very low compared to the total nebular mass
of ∼ 5.5 M⊙ , derived assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100 and a
dust mass value from the best-fit of the mid-IR to sub-mm data.
This suggests that the star has already lost a large fraction of
its initial mass, through past LBV eruptions or possibly binary
interactions.
Because of its brightness across the electromagnetic spectrum, RMC 143 is ideal for detailed studies of its chemical
and dust composition and kinematics of its circumstellar nebula. Future integral field unit spectroscopy and continuum highresolution observations (e.g. with Gemini/GMOS-S, VLT/Muse,
ALMA, ELT and the James Webb Space Telescope) will shed
light on the formation of RMC 143’s massive circumstellar nebula.
