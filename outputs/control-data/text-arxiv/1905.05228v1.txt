Abstract
Microwave photonics uses light to carry and process microwave signals over a photonic link. However,
light can instead be used as a stimulus to microwave devices that directly control microwave signals. Such
optically controlled amplitude and phase-shift switches are investigated for use in reconfigurable
microwave systems, but they suffer from large footprint, high optical power level required for switching,
lack of scalability and complex integration requirements, restricting their implementation in practical
microwave systems. Here, we report Monolithic Optically Reconfigurable Integrated Microwave Switches
(MORIMSs) built on a CMOS compatible silicon photonic chip that addresses all of the stringent
requirements. Our scalable micrometer-scale switches provide higher switching efficiency and require
optical power orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art. Also, it opens a new research direction
on silicon photonic platforms integrating microwave circuitry. This work has important implications in
reconfigurable microwave and millimeter wave devices for future communication networks.

1. Introduction
Reconfigurability has become a crucial feature in modern, agile, microwave and millimeter wave (MMW)
systems for emerging wireless communications, sensing and imaging.1–5 Among various existing building
blocks, optically reconfigurable MMW amplitude and phase-shift switches are key devises for beam
steering in RADAR systems and reconfigurable antennas for emerging 5G wireless communications
network 6,7. An optically controlled switch is a device whose electrical state can be tuned from insulating
(Off state) to conductive (On state) by means of optical stimuli8–11. The underlying physics relies on
photoconductive effect that occurs through the light interaction with a semiconductor material12. The
illumination with a photon energy larger than the semiconductor bandgap generates electron-hole pairs in
the control layer which modifies its electrical conductivity and affects the amplitude and phase of MMW
signals.
The idea of using light to control or even introduce signals directly into microwaves devices7,13,14 has drawn
great interest in the microwave community driven by the need for dynamic control, fast response, immunity
to electromagnetic interference, and good isolation between the controlling and controlled devices. The
optical solution promises better performances compared to its classical analogue that utilizes electrical or
microelectromechanical system which are prone to signal distortion and unwanted electromagnetic
interferences.1 Various reconfigurable microwave functionalities have been demonstrated including
cognitive radio applications15, microwave mixers 16 and phase shifters 17,18. Although optically controlled
microwave amplitude and phase switches have attracted appreciable attention due to their superior potential
performances, they are not yet sufficiently advanced for implementation in practical microwave systems.
The main reasons are twofold: (i) lack of scalability and compactness due to the fact that current approaches
use free-space or fiber illumination19,20 thus requiring costly and complex packaging and (ii) the optical
power level required to perform a switching operation 9,10,21–23 is prohibitively high, e.g., to achieve On/Off

2

RF switching with extinction ratio of ~10dB requires optical power in the range of tens to several hundreds
of a milliwatts. Moreover, it should be noted that photodiode and phototransistors switches can operate at
low optical power but they require electrical bias and are not scalable in large high-frequency phased array
systems.24,25 These challenges can be addressed by utilizing photonic technology to manipulating MMW
signals in microwave systems.
In this manuscript we overcome these challenges and report the design, fabrication and experimental
demonstration of Monolithic Optically Reconfigurable Integrated Microwave Switches (MORIMSs) built
on a CMOS compatible silicon photonic chip. Silicon nitride waveguides are exploited to route optical
waves towards silicon photoconductive patches to switch microwave signals at different locations of the
chip. Photonic integration allows high light coupling efficiency into silicon photoconductive patches. We
show that the integration of microwave circuits and optical waveguides on a CMOS platform provides
scalable micrometer-scale footprint switches with higher switching efficiency, large phase shift and optical
power requirement orders of magnitude lower than the state of the art. Our work paves the way for a new
generation of complex optically reconfigurable microwave circuits that benefit from the integrated silicon
photonics technology.
2. MORIMS architectures
Emerging photonic integrated circuits (PICs) technology 26 has already made a significant impact on highspeed optical interconnects and digital optical communication links27. PICs manufacturing using silicon on
insulator (SOI) platform is compatible with CMOS process allowing mass production at low cost28. It
offers highly desirable features such as small footprint, scalability and reduced power consumption. By
taking advantages of integrated photonics flexibility, our proposed devices use one single waveguide to
control multiple microwave switches in different locations on the chip. Moreover, integrated photonics
offers the possibility to engineer and optimize light coupling efficiency from optical waveguide to silicon

3

photoconductive patches in order to achieve high switching performance. Depending on the application,
the microwave switches can also be addressed independently or combined with a variety of
photonic building blocks such as Y-branch, directional couplers, ring resonators, Mach-Zehnder
modulators, etc. With this vision in mind, we have developed two different MORIMS architectures
as illustrated in Fig. 1a and b to meet different demands. Both architectures use a single mode
silicon nitride (SiNx) waveguide, silicon (Si) photoconductive patch and aluminum (Al) co-planar
waveguide transmission lines all built on the same SOI wafer. The signal electrode gap is made of
a Si photoconductive patch that acts as an electrical insulator (Off state) but under illumination
acts as a conductor (On state). The MORIMS operates with optical radiation at the wavelength of
808 nm.
The SOI wafer consists of 250nm-thick device layer and 3μm-thick buried oxide layer. During the
fabrication process, most of the silicon material is removed to form Si photoconductive patches with
dimension of 16μm by 12μm. Single-mode SiNx ridge waveguide with the dimensions of 800nm-width
and 400nm-height are fabricated and used to guide light toward Si patches in order to activate them at
different locations on the chip. The ridge waveguide and Si photoconductive patch are cladded by 1µmthick SiO2 layer. The Ground-Signal-Ground (GSG) transmission lines consist of 800nm-thick Al lines
with a tapered signal electrode toward the Si photoconductive patch.
The two proposed structures, referred as “tapered” and “through’ type, correspond to the way the optical
waveguide is designed on top of the silicon photoconductive patch to optically control its conductivity. The
“tapered type” structure (Fig. 1a), where SiNx waveguide is tapered on the Si photoconductive patch, is
devoted to maximizing the coupling of light from SiNx waveguide to Si photoconductive patch. The
tapered-type structure allows ~84% of the energy to be coupled into the Si photoconductive patch. The
“through type (Fig. 1b), where waveguide crossing the Si photoconductive patch, can be utilized in

4

cascaded configuration, i.e., connecting “optically” different microwave circuits as it will be demonstrated
later. Indeed, this configuration allows ~67% of the energy to be coupled into the silicon patch while the
remaining light can be used to control the following microwave circuit.
Fig. 1c and d show the SEM images of MORIMSs of both types. The SiNx waveguide conformally covers
the Si photoconductive patch without any crack and discontinuity.
3. Performance of MORIMSs
The On/Off performances of the MORIMS are characterized by measurements of the S-parameters. Fig.
2a and b show the measured S21 parameter of tapered- and through-type structures at On and Off state up
to ~40GHz. To characterize the switches performance, the extinction ratio Ron/off=|S21(On)/S21(Off)| is
adopted as the figure of merit that qualifies amplitude switching efficiency for a given microwave
frequency10. Fig. 2c and d show Ron/off with respect of input optical power at frequencies of 5GHz, 20GHz
and 40GHz. Overall, the On/Off ratios increase linearly from 0 to ~1.5mW before reaching a saturation
plateau. As expected, the tapered-type switch shows higher performance, with switching efficiency of
~25dB and ~23dB at 5GHz and 20GHz, respectively compared to ~14dB and ~12 dB achieved at same
frequencies with the through-type configuration. Although the through-type is less efficient under same
incident optical power, the remaining energy in the waveguide can be used to control another switch as
shown next. It is worth mentioning that the switching time of the proposed device is on the order of few
micro-seconds which is compatible with beam steering and beamforming applications requirements.
Table 1 shows the state-of-art photoconductive switches in terms of switching performances, optical power
requirement and footprint. Since most of the literature has reported switching at low frequencies and few
demonstrations have been done at very high frequencies, the amplitude switching performances are thus
compared at frequencies below and above 10GHz. Remarkably, MORIMSs provide higher performances,
i.e., ~29dB ~25dB, ~ 23dB and 11dB switching efficiency at 1, 5, 20 and 40GHz respectively, while using

5

less than 2mW which is by orders of magnitude lower than free-space illumination-based switches.
Moreover, MORIMS shows the capability of on-chip integration which can be incorporated into complex
on-chip photonics and microwave system with ultra-compact footprint to meet the desired high- packing
density.

4. Performances of cascaded MORIMSs
To demonstrate scalability and integration of multiple reconfigurable switches on the same chip, three
MORIMSs were designed and fabricated as depicted in Fig. 3a. The MORIMSs in series and parallel
configuration are fed by one single input optical waveguide. The injected light is routed toward two
different paths using a 3-dB Y-branch coupler. One of the paths addresses two cascaded through-type
MORIMSs. Fig. 3b - d show Ron/off at different locations. Because MORIMS_1 and 3 are in parallel, they
show same performance, for instance, their switching efficiency reaches ~10dB at 20GHz. However, the
switching efficiency of MORIMS_2 in series with MORIMS_1, drops by only ~ 4 dB at 20GHz.
MORIMS shows promising performances for cascaded optically reconfigurable switches for frequency
and phased array system.

5. Discussion and summary
The proposed optically reconfigurable switches are a proof of concept that can be easily implemented in
beamforming and beam steering microwave systems which require moderate switching time constant.
Moreover, the proposed integrated devices could also enable more advance functionalities when combining
other well-established photonic building blocks such as ring resonators, directional couplers and MachZehnder modulators on the same chip. The proposed approach can be tailored in the future generation of
ultra-high frequency communications systems which will face stringent requirements in terms of frequency
bandwidth, power consumption, size and packing density, and low-cost for mass production. In that area,
6

ultra-fast photoconductive switches exploiting III-V materials, with ultra-short carrier lifetime, are required
and outstanding efforts has been already made8,29. The proposed approach could be exploited in sampling
application that requires the combination of several switches with very accurate time delays between them.
This work is a real added value for developing integration technology for microwave signal processing.
In summary, we have demonstrated monolithic optically reconfigurable integrated microwave switches on
a SOI chip. Our approach consists of co-integration of microwave circuits with integrated photonic devices
to form optically reconfigurable microwave switches. A single input SiNx waveguide is used to route the
light toward switches at different location on chip. Integrated photonics provides miniaturized Si
photoconductive patches, high confinement of light in the waveguide and high coupling efficiency of light
from waveguide to silicon photoconductive microwave switches. Consequently, the demonstrated
engineered devices outperform their classical analogues in term of On/Off switching efficiency, footprint
and optical power level requirement. We experimentally demonstrate high microwave amplitude switching
performances of over 25dB around 5GHz, 23dB around 20GHz and 11dB at 40GHz, and lower optical
power requirement (~ 2mW) by orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-art photoconductive switches.
Scalability is a challenge that has been also advanced by demonstrating integrated multiple reconfigurable
switches on the same SOI chip with high amplitude switching performance. Moreover, phase shifts of 20°
and 60° were measured for microwave signals at 20GHz and 40GHz, respectively. This work is an
important step in introducing photonics into direct processing of microwave signals, paving the way
towards optically reconfigurable microwave and millimeter wave devices for future ground, embedded
radar systems, and emerging 5G wireless communication networks.
