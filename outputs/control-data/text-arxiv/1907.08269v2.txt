ABSTRACT

Transits in the planetary system WASP-4 were recently found to occur 80 s earlier than expected in observations from the TESS satellite. We present 22 new times of mid-transit that
confirm the existence of transit timing variations, and are well fitted by a quadratic ephemeris
with period decay dP/dt = −9.2 ± 1.1 ms yr−1 . We rule out instrumental issues, stellar activity and the Applegate mechanism as possible causes. The light-time effect is also not favoured
due to the non-detection of changes in the systemic velocity. Orbital decay and apsidal precession are plausible but unproven. WASP-4 b is only the third hot Jupiter known to show
transit timing variations to high confidence. We discuss a variety of observations of this and
other planetary systems that would be useful in improving our understanding of WASP-4 in
particular and orbital decay in general.

1 INTRODUCTION
Thousands of transiting planets are currently known. Under the
assumption of Keplerian motion, the transits are expected to recur with a strict periodicity. However, there is a range of phenomena that might change this behaviour, including stellar activity
(Oshagh et al. 2013), gravitational interactions (Holman & Murray
2005), the light-time effect in multiple systems (Woltjer 1922),
and orbital decay due to tides (Birkby et al. 2014). Because of
this, extensive efforts have been devoted to the detection of transit timing variations (TTVs) (e.g. Gibson et al. 2010; Harpsøe et al.
2013; Maciejewski et al. 2018b). Many examples have been found
for small planets observed using the Kepler satellite (Mazeh et al.
2013) but only two detections have been made for a planet outside the Kepler field. Maciejewski et al. (2016) used transit timing measurements taken over 3.3 yr to find a quadratic term in the
orbital ephemeris of WASP-12 to a significance of 5σ (see also
Patra et al. 2017; Maciejewski et al. 2018b), and WASP-47 b shows
sinusoidal TTVs due to the presence of two smaller short-period
planets (Becker et al. 2015).
In this work we show that WASP-4 b (Wilson et al. 2008) is
the third giant planet known to exhibit detectable TTVs, with a
significance of 8.4σ. This confirms preliminary suggestions from
Bouma et al. (2019, hereafter B19) based on data from the TESS
satellite (Ricker et al. 2015). Baluev et al. (2015) have also claimed
a tentative detection of TTVs in WASP-4, in the form of a sinusoidal variation with a period near 5 d; we do not confirm this detection. When needed, we will adopt the physical properties of the
WASP-4 system given by Southworth (2012). In brief, the planet
has mass 1.25 MJup and radius 1.36 RJup , and is on a 1.338 d orbit around a star of mass 0.93 M⊙ and radius 0.91 R⊙ . The star’s
effective temperature is 5500 K (Mortier et al. 2013) and it shows
magnetic activity in the form of dark starspots (Sanchis-Ojeda et al.
2011). No companion stars have been found in high-resolution
imaging studies (Ngo et al. 2015; Evans et al. 2016) and no longterm trend in systemic velocity has been identified (Knutson et al.
2014).

The STE4 CCD was used with a Cousins R filter, 2×2 binning to
decrease the readout time, and the telescope defocussed. The resulting light curves have scatters of 1.5, 2.3 and 1.6 mmag. In the
most recent run (2019 June) we cross-checked timings with another
telescope at the observatory to confirm their reliability.

2.1 Data reduction
The raw data were reduced into light curves using the DEFOT
pipeline (Southworth et al. 2009a, 2014) which implements aperture photometry, image motion tracking by cross-correlation with
a reference image, and calculation of a differential-magnitude light
curve. The light curve was obtained by simultaneously fitting the
coefficients of a low-order polynomial versus time, and the weights
of a set of comparison stars, to the data obtained outside transit. In
all cases we used a linear or quadratic polynomial and the coefficients were included as fitted parameters in all subsequent analyses.
The best light curve was obtained by manually iterating the
aperture sizes and which comparison stars were included – we
found that the choices made here do affect the scatter of the light
curve but have no significant effect on its shape. We did not perform bias or flat-field calibrations because they have a negligible
effect on DFOSC data except for an increase in the noise level of
the light curve (Southworth et al. 2014). All new data are shown in
Fig. 1.
The timestamps were converted to the BJD(TDB) timescale
using routines from Eastman et al. (2010). Manual time checks
were performed for images in most observing sequences, and no
discrepancies were noticed1 . We have previously found a good
agreement between the timestamps on the Danish and MPG 2.2m
telescopes (Southworth et al. 2015), supporting the reliability of
both.
Southworth et al. (2009b) used an early version of DEFOT so
the 2008 data were re-reduced with the current version. This allowed the use of image motion tracking, additional comparison stars,
and timestamps on the BJD(TDB) timescale. The re-reduced data
supersede those from Southworth et al. (2009b).

2 OBSERVATIONS
We have been monitoring transits in the WASP-4 system for
approximately a decade using the Danish 1.54 m telescope and
DFOSC imager at ESO La Silla, as a side-project of the MiNDSTEp Consortium (Dominik et al. 2010). Four transits observed in
the 2008 season were presented in Southworth et al. (2009b), and
we also observed one transit in 2009, two in 2011, three in 2015,
three in 2016, two in 2017 and three in 2018. All observations were
obtained through a Cousins R filter with the CCD unbinned and the
telescope significantly defocussed to enhance the photometric precision (Southworth et al. 2009a). The scatters of the datasets versus
transit fits (see below) range from 0.54 to 1.03 mmag with cadences
of typically 140 s.
We also observed one transit in the WASP-4 system using the
NTT and EFOSC2 imager (Buzzoni et al. 1984) with an SDSS r
filter (ESO filter #784) on the night of 2011/10/21. The telescope
was defocussed, the CCD was not binned, and only one comparison
star was used due to the small field of view. The light curve is of
very high quality (see Tregloan-Reed & Southworth 2013), with a
scatter of 0.47 mmag.
Finally, we observed three transits using the SAAO 1.0 m telescope at Sutherland, South Africa: two in 2016 and one in 2019.

3 MEASUREMENTS OF THE TRANSIT TIMES
Each transit was fitted in isolation using the JKTEBOP2 code
(Southworth 2013, and references therein). The fitted parameters
were the transit midpoint T0 , the fractional radii of the two components (rA = RaA and rb = Rab where RA is the radius of the
star, Rb is the radius of the planet, and a is the semimajor axis of
the relative orbit) expressed as their sum and ratio, the orbital inclination, and the coefficients of the polynomial versus time. We
modelled limb darkening using the quadratic law, fitted for the linear coefficient, and fixed the quadratic coefficient at an appropriate
value.
Uncertainties on the transit times
pwere obtained using Monte
Carlo simulations and multiplied by χν2 where χ2ν is the reduced

The 2009 season with the Danish Telescope suffered from a timing problem (Southworth et al. 2009c, 2010). We have investigated this further and
found that it did not affect any observations of WASP-4 presented here.

χ2 of the fit. This final step is necessary because the aperture photometry routine used in our pipeline tends to underestimate the observational uncertainties. Table 1 gives the 22 transit times calculated in this work. To this dataset we added all timings from table 2
of B19, which includes 41 measurements from the literature and 18
timings from the TESS light curve.

4 TRANSIT TIMING ANALYSIS
Our analysis was performed on the transit timings assembled
above. We fitted a straight line to the times as a function of orbital cycle, using a zeropoint for cycle number near to the midpoint of the available data to avoid correlations between the parameters of the ephemeris (Fig. 2). This yielded a poor fit so we tried
a quadratic ephemeris instead, finding a significant improvement.
The best-fitting linear ephemeris is:

This is roughly 3σ lower than the value of −12.6 ± 1.2 ms yr−1
found by B19. We investigated this by applying our analysis to only
the transit times used by B19, which precisely reproduced their results. Therefore the difference in the period derivatives found by
ourselves and by B19 is fully explained by the inclusion of additional transit times in the current study.
The quadratic ephemeris has a much lower χν2 than the linear
ephemeris. To explore this further we calculated the Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz 1978) to be 172.2 for the quadratic
and 269.6 for the linear ephemeris, and the Akaike Information
Criterion (Akaike 1974) to be 165.1 for the quadratic and 264.8
for the linear ephemeris. All three statistical quantities give a significant improvement for the quadratic versus the linear ephemeris,
meaning that we have detected TTVs in the WASP-4 system. The
quadratic term is negative and measured to 8.4σ significance.
The χν2 of our preferred quadratic ephemeris is significantly above unity. We have found this situation to occur for
most transit timing studies both in our own experience (e.g.
Southworth et al. 2016) and in published studies (e.g. Baluev et al.
2015; Maciejewski et al. 2018a). The 8.4σ significance level of the
quadratic term already includes an allowance for this large χν2 .
Fig. 2 shows that our new timings are consistent with published
values in all cases where such a comparison can be drawn.
WASP-4 A shows starspots and these are expected to add
scatter to timing measurements both on theoretical (Ballerini et al.
2012; Oshagh et al. 2013) and empirical (Maciejewski et al. 2018b)
grounds. The obvious outlier at cycle −544 and residual −64 s is
affected by starspots. To investigate this we rejected the six timings
clearly affected by starspot crossing events (Table 1) and recalculated the ephemerides. We find that the χν2 drops to 1.30 for the
quadratic and 1.70 for the linear ephemeris, the quadratic term is
not significantly changed, and its detection significance becomes
8.2σ. We conclude that spot activity increases the scatter of the
transit timings but that TTVs are still detected to high confidence.
Visual inspection of Fig. 2 suggested the possibility of a sinusoidal variation superimposed on the quadratic term. We therefore calculated a periodogram of the residuals of the best fit to the
quadratic ephemeris, using the PERIOD 04 package (Lenz & Breger
2004). The periodogram contained no significant peaks, with the
highest having a signal-to-noise ratio of 2.7. We find no significant
peak near the period of 5.1 d tentatively identified by Baluev et al.
(2015), so do not confirm this detection of sinusoidal variation. Further observations are needed to refine these conclusions.

We now discuss possible causes of this effect.

with χν2 = 1.41 and an rms scatter

fit. We also fitted a cubic ephemeris but found it to be a negligible
improvement on the quadratic ephemeris.
This quadratic coefficient corresponds to a period change of

5.1 Starspots
Transit times measured from light curves exhibiting spot crossing events can be biased away from the true time of midpoint because the fitted model (transit of a planet across a limbdarkened but otherwise uniform-brightness star) is no longer adequate (Ballerini et al. 2012; Oshagh et al. 2013). The bias depends
on where the spot crossing event is, with those near the start or end
of a transit having the strongest effect (Oshagh et al. 2013). As activity levels on stars undergo cycles lasting years to decades (e.g.

Danish telescope, orange for the SAAO 1.0m, and purple for the NTT. Published results are shown using open circles: red for the literature data collected by
B19 and green for the TESS timings from B19. The dotted line shows the difference between the best-fitting linear and quadratic ephemerides. Grey asterisks
have been placed near the top of the figure to indicate transit times measured from a light curve with a spot crossing event.

Baliunas et al. 1995), these effects could conceivably mimic a slow
TTV. We have visually inspected all transits presented in the current
work in order to find those with clear spot crossing events. We have
previously found visual methods to perform well in the identification of spot anomalies in transit light curves (Močnik et al. 2017).
We have indicated the transits with spot crossing events on Fig. 2,
and find no clear correlation with the residuals versus the quadratic
ephemeris fit. The quadratic term in the ephemeris is also detected
to almost the same significance if these timings are rejected from
the ephemeris fit.
From Fig. 1 we see that starspots are preferentially detected
in WASP-4 towards the start or end of totality in the transit light
curve. This is because the starspots move with the stellar surface
at an approximately constant angular speed, and thus at a variable
linear speed when projected into the plane of the sky. The starspots
move faster when they are near the projected centre of the star,
so are less likely to be found there. Conversely, smaller starspots
may be preferentially found away from the limb of the star because
limb darkening will attenuate their photometric signal and make
their detection less likely. Both effects should be accounted for in
detailed statistical studies of these phenomena.
Watson & Dhillon (2004) investigated the effect of starspots
on timing measurements due to the Wilson depression: the phenomenon that starspots are slightly depressed into the surface of
the star. They found that this effect was sufficient to cause a change
in the measured time of an eclipse at the level of a few seconds for
a white dwarf plus M-dwarf binary. The effect will be less than a
second for WASP-4 due to the larger radius ratio, so is not capable
of causing the TTV we have found.

5.2 Applegate mechanism
Changes in the quadrupole moment of the star (Applegate 1992)
have been proposed as a possible cause of TTVs in planetary
systems. Watson & Marsh (2010) calculated the amplitude of the
TTVs for WASP-4 for three scenarios concerning the length of the
activity cycle in the host star. The largest TTV amplitude was found
to be 15.3 s for a 50 yr activity cycle, so is a factor of six too small
to explain the observed TTVs.
c 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

5.3 Orbital decay
Tidal effects will cause the majority of known hot Jupiters to merge
with their host stars on a timescale of several Gyr (Levrard et al.
2009; Jackson et al. 2009). This orbital decay will initially appear as a continuous decrease in their orbital period, causing a
quadratic variation in the transit times. We followed the approach
of Patra et al. (2017) to calculate the modified stellar tidal quality
factor for the WASP-4 system, finding Q′⋆ = 104.58±0.03 .
A wide range of possible Q′⋆ values have been found in
previous studies, both theoretical and observational. The canonical value of Q′⋆ is 106 (e.g. Ogilvie & Lin 2007), a value of
105.5 was found to be a good match to a sample of extrasolar planets (Jackson et al. 2008), and a theoretical study by
Essick & Weinberg (2016) yielded Q′⋆ ≈ 105 to 106 for shortperiod hot Jupiters. But other studies disagree: theoretical work
by Penev & Sasselov (2011) constrained Q′⋆ to be 108 –109.5 , an
observational study by Penev et al. (2012) found Q′⋆ > 107 , and
Collier Cameron & Jardine (2018) used the distribution of orbital
separations of the known population of transiting hot Jupiters to
deduce Q′⋆ = 108.26±0.14 .
The value of Q′⋆ is also expected to depend on the nature of
the tidal perturbation and the internal structure of the star (Ogilvie
2014; Penev et al. 2018), on orbital period (Barker 2011), and on
planet mass (Barker & Ogilvie 2010). Barker (2011) found a dependence on orbital period of Q′⋆ ∝ P 14/5 , giving a value of approximately 105.3 for the WASP-4 system.
A tidal quality factor small enough to cause the TTV observed
in WASP-4 is smaller than any determined in the observational and
theoretical studies listed above. However, it is sufficiently close to
the lower envelope of Q′⋆ values, and this envelope is sufficiently
large, that it is not currently possible to rule out orbital decay as
a cause of the TTV. Further work is needed to better understand
the possible values of Q′⋆ and its dependence on system parameters
such as planet mass and orbital period.
5.4 Light-time effect
The presence of a third component in the system on a wider orbit
than WASP-4 b will cause a change in the measured transit tim-

ings due to the varying distance of the transiting system from the
observer coupled with the finite speed of light.
As our data are adequately explained by a quadratic function,
we can provide only speculative limits on the properties of a sinusoid that might also provide a good fit to the timings. To do so, we
fit a linear ephemeris to all timings obtained before JD 2456600
and found that the most recent data arrived ∼100 s earlier than predicted by this ephemeris. As lower limits we adopted a period of
triple the time interval covered by all of the timings, and an amplitude of 300 s. This yields a mass function of 2 × 1016 kg, giving a
minimum mass of the putative third component of ∼2 × 10−5 M⊙
(0.02 MJup ). An object of this mass would have easily evaded spectroscopic detection, and at a minimum orbital separation of 0.6 au it
would be much too close for detection via high-resolution imaging.
If present, this third object would imprint an orbital motion of amplitude ∼500 m s−1 on the radial velocity (RV) of
the star. Knutson et al. (2014) searched for changes in the systemic velocity of WASP-4 A, finding an insignificant value of

5.9 m s yr , so would be 36 m s−1 over the 6-year time interval
covered by the RVs and 69 m s−1 over the 11.7-year time interval
covered by the transit timings. The lowest possible RV change over
a 6-year time interval is 67 m s−1 , two times larger than allowed by
the 3σ upper limit on γ̇, so the third-body interpretation is moderately inconsistent with the data.
Additional possibilities that could be invoked to bring the
third-body hypothesis into better agreement with the data are orbital eccentricity (which must be sufficiently low to yield a roughly
quadratic variation over the 11.7-year interval covered by the available timings), an inclined orbit (which will not help much because
it would require a larger third body mass to obtain the same amplitude of the light-time effect), and a longer orbital period (which
would also require a more massive third body). We conclude that
the light-time effect is not a good explanation for the observed
TTVs. Further analysis and RV measurements of the host star
would help to strengthen this conclusion.

5.5 Apsidal motion
Patra et al. (2017) attempted to explain the quadratic orbital
ephemeris of WASP-12 through apsidal precession, finding that it
was consistent with the data but disfavoured relative to an orbital
decay model. It is difficult to apply this model to WASP-4 because
it requires measurements of the midpoint of occultations as well
as transits over a significant time interval. Whilst some occultation timings are available (Beerer et al. 2011; Cáceres et al. 2011;
Zhou et al. 2015) they lack the precision and time sampling necessary to provide useful constraints on apsidal motion in the system
(see also B19). We recommend that new high-precision observations of occultations in the WASP-4 system are obtained.
Apsidal motion can only occur in eccentric systems.
Triaud et al. (2010) found e < 0.018 for WASP-4 and Beerer et al.
(2011) found e cos ω = 0.00030 ± 0.00086: these do not constrain eccentricity sufficiently to rule out apsidal precession. One
problem for this hypothesis, however, is the need for the system
to have a non-zero eccentricity despite the presence of strong tidal
effects in this short-period system containing a cool star with an
extensive convective envelope.

6 SUMMARY
We have presented 22 times of mid-transit for the WASP-4 transiting planetary system that confirm the early arrival of transits
noticed in TESS data (B19) and are consistent with a quadratic
ephemeris. A constant-orbital-period model is rejected at the 8.4σ
significance level, making WASP-4 b only the third hot Jupiter with
TTVs detected to high significance.
We have explored possible explanations for the observed
TTVs. Instrumental timing effects cannot be blamed because there
is good agreement between different telescopes in the same observing seasons, and they are also not apparent in any of the tests
we have performed. Biases due to spot crossing events in the light
curves have a negligible effect on our results so can be ruled out
as the source of the TTVs. The Applegate mechanism gives TTVs
a factor of six smaller than observed. The light-time effect due to
a third body struggles to match our results. Apsidal precession is
plausible and deserves further investigation, in particular the observation of secondary eclipses so the orbital period found from
transits can be compared to that found from occultations.
Orbital decay is a plausible but not favourable option for causing the observed TTV. The tidal quality factor needed, Q′⋆ =
104.58±0.03 , is smaller than those predicted from theoretical arguments or measured from the population of known transiting planets.
However, the envelope of possible values of Q′⋆ is broad and close
to the value found for WASP-4, so it is not currently possible to
discount this hypothesis.
A program of transiting timing measurements of a wide variety of planetary systems would help by providing observational
constraints on orbital decay as a function of stellar type, planet
mass, and orbital period. As Q′⋆ is expected to depend on the system parameters, it also would be interesting to perform TTV analyses on other systems similar to WASP-4. We used the TEPCat3
catalogue (Southworth 2011) to identify HATS-2 and WASP-64 as
the best candidates. These were found 5–6 years later than WASP-4
so their transit timings cover a smaller time interval, but this could
be compensated for by obtaining a larger number of high-quality
transit observations in the near future.
We also advocate obtaining new observations of the WASP-4
system, and will be keeping it on the target list of the MiNDSTEp
transit monitoring program. New transit times would refine and extend the baseline of the quadratic ephemeris. Further timings of
secondary eclipses would allow the apsidal motion hypothesis to
be ruled in or out. RV measurements of the planet host star would
give stricter limits on the change in systemic velocity of the system.
WASP-4 and WASP-12 stand out as the only hot Jupiters for which
unexplained TTVs have been detected: as this phenomenon is uncommon it is reasonable to propose unusual or unlikely scenarios
for such systems.
