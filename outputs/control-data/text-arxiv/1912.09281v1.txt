A SERRE PRESENTATION FOR THE ıQUANTUM COVERING
GROUPS
CHRISTOPHER CHUNG
Abstract. Let (U, Uı ) be a quasi-split quantum symmetric pair of Kac-Moody type. The
ıquantum group Uı admits a Serre presentation featuring the ı-Serre relations in terms of
ı-divided powers. Generalizing this result, we give a Serre presentation Uıπ of quantum
symmetric pairs (Uπ , Uıπ ) for quantum covering algebras Uπ , which have an additional
parameter π that specializes to the Lusztig quantum group when π = 1 and quantum supergroups of anisotropic type when π = −1. We give a Serre presentation for Uıπ , introducing
the ıπ -Serre relations and ıπ -divided powers.

1. Introduction
1.1. The Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group U is a q-deformation of the universal enveloping
algebra of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra, with Chevalley generators Ei , Fi , Ki±1 , for
i ∈ I. U admits a familiar presentation, its Serre presentation, with a key feature being the
(n)
q-Serre relations among the Ei ’s and Fi ’s. In terms of divided powers Fi = Fin /[n]!qi (cf.
[Lu93] where [n]!qi are the so called quantum factorials), the q-Serre relations among the Fi ’s
has a compact form: for i 6= j ∈ I,

The quantum group U is a Hopf algebra with a comultiplication ∆ : U → U ⊗ U.
Quantum symmetric pairs (U, Uı ), are deformations of classical symmetric pairs which are
defined using Satake diagrams, which are Dynkin diagrams with some nodes blackened and
other nodes connected in pairs by a diagram involution. The theory of quantum symmetric
pairs was systematically studied by Letzter for U of finite type (cf. [Le99, Le02]) and in
Kac-Moody type the theory was further developed by Kolb [Ko14]. The ıquantum group Uı
is a (right) coideal subalgebra of U: it satisfies the property that ∆ : Uı → Uı ⊗ U. Main

(2.13):

for i ∈ I,

where ς = (ςi )i∈I , are parameters.
Borrowing terminologies from real Lie groups, we will call a quantum symmetric pair
and an ıquantum group quasi-split (and respectively, split) if the underlying Satake diagram
contains no black node (respectively, with the trivial involution in the Satake diagram).
These can be thought of as the ıquantum groups associated to the Chevalley involution ω,
coupled with a diagram involution τ (which is allowed to be the identity). A quasi-split
ıquantum group takes the generalized Cartan matrix and a diagram involution τ as its only
inputs.
In [CLW18], a Serre presentation uniform relations for the quasi-split ıquantum groups of
Kac-Moody type with general parameters is formulated precisely, generalizing the work of
Letzter in finite type and Kolb in Kac-Moody type for |aij | ≤ 3, cf. [Le02, Le03, Ko14]. A
centerpiece of the Serre presentation for Uı is the ı-Serre relations between Bi and Bj for
τ i = i 6= j. These relations can be expressed in striking similarity to the q-Serre relation

where the ı-divided powers Bi,p are polynomials (compare Lusztig’s divided powers, which
are monomials) in Bi which depend on a parity p arising from the parities of the highest
weights of highest weight U-modules when evaluated at the coroot hi . The ı-divided powers
were introduced in [BW18a, BeW18], and are canonical basis elements for (the modified
form of) Uı in the sense of [BW18b]. Writing the ı-Serre relations (1.3) in terms of ı-divided
powers provided a uniform reformulation of complicated case-by-case relations for the cases
|aij | ≤ 3 in [Ko14, BK19], which enabled the method of proof in [CLW18, §4].
A precise formulation of the Serre presentation is crucial to the formulation of a bar
involution on a general ıquantum group Uı as predicted in [BW18a]; it allows one to write
down the constraints that the parameters should satisfy [BK15]. The bar involution on Uı is
a basic ingredient for the canonical basis for Uı [BW18b, BW18c]. The ıdivided powers are
also a key component in constructing the Frobenius-Lusztig homomorphism for ıquantum
groups at roots of unity in [BaS19].
1.2. A quantum covering group Uπ , introduced in [CHW13] (cf. [HW15]) is an algebra
defined via a super Cartan datum I (a finite indexing set associated to Kac-Moody superalgebras with no isotropic odd roots). Uπ depends on two parameters q and π, where π 2 = 1. A
quantum covering group specializes at π = 1 to the quantum group above, and at π = −1 to
a quantum supergroup of anisotropic type (see [BKM98]). In addition to the usual Chevalley
generators, we have generators Ji for each i ∈ I. If one writes Ki as q hi , then analogously we
will have Ji = π hi . The parameter π can be thought of as a shadow of the parity shift functor
Π in Hill and Wang’s ([HW15]) categorification of quantum groups by the spin quiver Hecke
superalgebras introduced in [KKT16]. Since then, further progress has been made on the
odd/spin/super categorification of quantum covering groups; see [KKO14, EL16, BE17].

1.3. In this paper, we formulate quasi-split quantum symmetric pairs (Uπ , Uıπ ) for quantum
covering groups. The ıquantum covering group Uıπ is by definition a subalgebra of Uπ that
satisfies the coideal property, with the same embedding formulas as 1.2 cf. (2.13).
A first step in generalizing the Serre presentation in [CLW18] involved defining suitable
π-analogues of the ı-divided powers, which we call the ıπ -divided powers with πi and Ji
incorporated judiciously. The ı-divided powers satisfy explicit closed form formulas in terms
of the PBW basis for U, which were crucial for the proof of the ı-Serre relation (1.3). We were
able to deduce that the ıπ -divided powers also satisfy similar expansion formulas. With this,
we were able to prove the validity of the ıπ -Serre relations (4.10) below by a parallel strategy
of reducing to a (q, π)-binomial identity, [CLW18, §4]. The ıπ -divided powers, accompanying
expansion formulas and ıπ -Serre relations specialize to those contained in [BeW18] when we
set π = 1.
As a notational convenience, in the rest of this paper we will drop the subscript π, so U
is understood to refer to quantum covering group. We will explicitly mention the quantum
groups when we specialize π = 1.
1.4. We will indicate here a few applications: in an upcoming paper [C19b], the results
in this paper will be used to construct a quasi K-matrix and prove the integrality of its
action cf. [BW18b, BW18c]. This will enable us to define based modules for the ıquantum
covering groups, and develop canonical basis for these modules. The ıπ -divided powers are
also expected to play a role in defining a version of a Frobenius-Lusztig homomorphism for
quantum super symmetric pairs at roots of unity.

2. The preliminaries
2.1. Quantum covering groups. Here, we recall the definition of a quantum covering
group from [CHW13] starting with a super Cartan datum and a root datum. A Cartan
datum is a pair (I, ·) consisting of a finite set I and a symmetric bilinear form ν, ν ′ 7→ ν · ν ′
on the free abelian group Z[I] with values in Z satisfying
∈ Z>0 ;
(a) di = i·i
2
i·j
(b) 2 i·i ∈ −N for i 6= j in I, where N = {0, 1, 2, . . .}.
`
If the datum can be decomposed as I = I0̄ I1̄ such that
(c) I1̄ 6= ∅,
∈ 2Z if i ∈ I1̄ ,
(d) 2 i·j
i·i
(e) di ≡ p(i) mod 2, ∀i ∈ I.
then we will called it a (bar-consistent) super Cartan datum. Condition [(e)] is known as the
‘bar-consistency’ condition and is almost always satisfied for super Cartan data of finite or
affine type (with one exception).
Note that (d) and (e) imply that
(f) i · j ∈ 2Z for all i, j ∈ I.

4

CHRISTOPHER CHUNG

The i ∈ I0̄ are called even, i ∈ I1̄ are called odd. We define a parity function p : I → {0, 1}
so that i ∈ Ip(i)
¯ . We extend this function to the homomorphism p : Z[I] → Z. Then p induces
a Z2 -grading on Z[I] which we shall call the parity grading.
A super Cartan datum (I, ·) is said to be of finite (resp. affine) type exactly when (I, ·)
is of finite (resp. affine) type as a Cartan datum (cf. [Lu93, §2.1.3]). In particular, the only
super Cartan datum of finite type is the one corresponding to the Lie superalgebras of type
B(0, n) for n ≥ 1 i.e. the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras osp(1|2n).
A root datum associated to a super Cartan datum (I, ·) consists of
(a) two finitely generated free abelian groups Y , X and a perfect bilinear pairing h·, ·i :
Y × X → Z;
(b) an embedding I ⊂ X (i 7→ i′ ) and an embedding I ⊂ Y (i 7→ i) satisfying
(c) hi, j ′ i = 2i·j
for all i, j ∈ I.
i·i
We will always assume that the root datum is X-regular (respectively Y -regular) image of the
embedding I ⊂ X (respectively, the image of the embedding I ⊂ Y ) is linearly independent
in X (respectively, in Y ).
The matrix A := (aij ) := hi, j ′ i is a symmetrizable generalized super Cartan matrix: if
D = diag(di | i ∈ I), then DA is symmetric.
Let π be a parameter such that
π 2 = 1.
For any i ∈ I, we set

qi = q i·i/2 ,

πi = π p(i) .
i·i

we therefore have π p(ν) =

For any ring R we define a new ring Rπ = R[π]/(π 2 − 1) (with π commuting with R). Below,
we will work over K(q)π where K is a field of characteristic 0.

2.2. The algebra U̇. Recall [Lu93, Cl14] that the modified form of U, denoted by U̇, is
a (non-unital) K(q)π -algebra generated by 1λ , Ei 1λ , Fi 1λ , for i ∈ I, λ ∈ X, where 1λ are
orthogonal idempotents. Let A = Zπ [q, q −1 ]. There is an A-subalgebra A U̇ generated by
(n)
(n)
Ei 1λ , Fi 1λ for i ∈ I and n ≥ 0 and λ ∈ X. Note that U̇ is naturally a U-bimodule, and
in particular we have
Kh 1λ = 1λ Kh = q hh,λi 1λ , ∀h ∈ Y.
We have the mod 2 homomorphism Z → Z2 , k 7→ k, where Z2 = {0̄, 1̄}. Let us fix an
i ∈ I. Define
M
M
(2.5)
U̇i,ev :=
U̇1λ ,
U̇i,odd :=
U̇1λ .
λ: hhi ,λi∈2Z

λ: hhi ,λi∈1+2Z

Then U̇ = U̇i,ev ⊕ U̇i,odd . Similarly, letting A U̇i,ev = U̇i,ev ∩A U̇ and A U̇i,odd = U̇i,odd ∩A U̇,
we have A U̇ = A U̇i,ev ⊕ A U̇i,odd .
For our later use, with i ∈ I fixed once for all, we need to keep track of the precise value
hhi , λi in an idempotent 1λ but do not need to know which specific weights λ are used. Thus
it is convenient to introduce the following generic notation
1⋆m = 1⋆i,m ,

(2.6)

for m ∈ Z,

to denote an idempotent 1λ for some λ ∈ X such that m = hhi , λi. In this notation, the
identities in [Cl14] (with a correction provided in [CSW18, Lemma 3.2]) can be written as
follows: for any m ∈ Z, a, b ∈ Z≥0 , and i 6= j ∈ I,

From now on, we shall always drop the index i to write the idempotents as 1⋆m .
Remark 2.1. If u ∈ U satisfies u1⋆2k−1 = 0 for all possible idempotents 1⋆2k−1 with k ∈ Z (or
respectively, u1⋆2k = 0 for all possible 1⋆2 with k ∈ Z), then u = 0.

2.3. The ıquantum covering group Uı . Let (Y, X, h·, ·i, · · · ) be a root datum of (super)
type (I, ·). We call a permutation τ of the set I an involution of the Cartan datum (I, ·) if
τ 2 = id and τ i · τ j = i · j for i, j ∈ I. Note we allow τ = id. We will always assume that
τ extends to an involution on X and an involution on Y (also denoted by τ ), respectively,
such that the perfect bilinear pairing is invariant under the involution τ . The permutation
τ of I induces an K(q)-algebra automorphism of U, defined by
(2.11)
Define

τ : Ei 7→ Eτ i ,

Fi 7→ Fτ i ,

Kh 7→ Kτ h ,

∀i ∈ I, h ∈ Y.

Y ı = {h ∈ Y | τ (h) = −h}.

(2.12)

Just as in [CLW18], in this paper we will only consider the quasi-split case (corresponding
to Satake diagrams without black nodes).
Definition 2.2. The quasi-split ıquantum group, denoted by Uıς or Uı , is the K(q)-subalgebra
of U generated by
e −1 ,
(2.13)
Bi := Fi + ςi Eτ i K
Jei (i ∈ I),
Kµ (µ ∈ Y ı ).
i
Here the parameters

ς = (ςi )i∈I ∈ (K(q)× )I ,

(2.14)

are assumed to satisfy Conditions (2.15)–(2.17) below:
(2.15)
(2.16)
(2.17)

ςi qi = ςi qi if τ i = i and aij 6= 0 for some j ∈ I \ {i};
ςi = ςτ i if ai,τ i = 0;
−ai,τ i

ςτ i = πi qi

ςi if ai,τ i 6= 0.

The conditions on the parameters ensure that Uı admits a suitable bar-involution (see
§4.7).
⊲ Uı is a (right) coideal subalgebra of U, i.e., ∆ : Uı −→ Uı ⊗ U.
⊲ In [Ko14] and [CLW18] an additional set of parameters κi is considered; in the setting
of quantum covering groups the only interesting case (κi 6= 0 for some i ∈ I) exists in rank
2 (osp(1|4)), so we will omit this from general consideration.
2.4. Structure and size of Uı . A few of the results on the size and structure of Uı are
collected here cf. [Ko14, §5–6]. First, we define the projections Pλ and πα,β similarly to
[Ko14, §5.2]: by the triangular decomposition [CHW13, Corollary 2.3.3],
M
U=
U+ UJ Kλ S(U− ),
λ∈Y

where UJ = hJµ | µ ∈ Y i and S denotes the antipode of U. For any λ ∈ Y let
(2.18)

Pλ : U → U+ UJ Kλ S(U− )

denote the projection with respect to this decomposition.

Similarly, let

α U U−β

(2.19)

denote the projection with respect to the decomposition
M
0 −
U+
U=
α U U−β .
α,β∈Y +

Because the embedding formulas for the ıquantum covering groups follow the same form
as in [Ko14, (5.1)] (with X = ∅ and si = 0), we have the following technical lemma, proved
in the same way as in loc. cit.:
Lemma 2.3. Let α, β ∈ Q+ . If πα,β (Fij (Bi , Bj )) 6= 0 then λij − α ∈ QΘ and λij − β ∈ QΘ .
Using this, we also have the following results about Uı :

Proposition 2.4. In U, we have Pλij (Fij (Bi , Bj )) = 0 for all i, j ∈ I.

Proposition 2.5. In Uı , we have the relation
X
′
(2.20)
Fij (Bi , Bj ) ∈
U0Θ BJ for all i, j ∈ I.
{J∈J | wt(J)<λij }

We now show that Uı has the P
same size as U− , cf [Ko14, §6.1–2]. For any multi-index
J = (j1 , . . . , jn ), define wt(J) = ni=1 αj , andSFJ = Fj1 . . . Fjn and BJ = Bj1 . . . Bjn , and
define |J| = n. Let J be a fixed subset of n∈N0 I n such that {FJ | J ∈ J } is a basis
′
of U− , and hence a basis of U′ as a left U+ U0 -module. Define a filtration F ∗ of U− by
F n (U− ) = span{FJ | J ∈ I m , m ≤ n} for all n ∈ N0 . By the homogeneity of the (q, π)-Serre
relations (2.2), the set span{FJ | J ∈ J , |J| = n} forms a basis of F n (U− ). Then, we have
the following proposition, cf. [Ko14, Prop 6.2]:
′

Proposition 2.6. The set {BJ | J ∈ J } is a basis of the left (or right) U+ U0 -module Uı .
Prop 6.2], which is much simpler for
Proof. The argument is the same as the one
P in [Ko14,
n
0′
X = ∅: for L ∈ I , one can obtain BL ∈ J∈J UΘ BJ by an induction on n = wt(L) and
using the (q, π)-Serre relations. We thus have that {BJ | J ∈ J } spans Uı . The fact that
{BJ | J ∈ J } is linearly independent follows from the specific form of the generators Bi
having ‘leading term’ Fi and the triangular decomposition.

3. ıπ -divided powers and expansion formulas in rank one
In this section we will describe the ıπ -divided powers, which are generalizations of the
formulas for ı-divided powers developed in [BeW18] to the quantum covering group setting.
Recall from [CHW13, 2.1] that the rank one quantum covering group U with a single odd
root (i.e. U is of type I = I1̄ = {1}) is the K(q)π -algebra generated by E, F, K ±1 , J, subject
to the relations: KK −1 = K −1 K = 1, and
JK = KJ,
(3.1)

JE = EJ, JF = F J,

J 2 = 1,

KEK −1 = q 2 EK, KF K −1 = q −2 F K,

The rank one ıquantum covering group Uı is generated as a K(q)π -algebra by a single
generator
B = F + q −1 EK −1 .
Lemma 3.1. There is an anti-involution ς of the K-algebra U fixing the generators E, F, K ±1 , J
and sending q 7→ q −1 .
Proof. We have
ς(KEK −1 ) = K −1 EK = q −2 E = ς(q 2 E),

ς(KF K −1 ) = K −1 F K = q 2 F = ς(q −2 F ).

We also have



JK − K −1
JK − K −1
ς(EF − πF E) = F E − πEF =

,
πq −1 − q
πq − q −1

and so ς preserves all the relations in (3.1) (since J is central).

Note that ς([n]) = π n−1 [n], and so ς[n]! = π ( 2 ) [n].

We have A U̇ = A U̇ev ⊕ A U̇odd . By a base change we define U̇ev and U̇odd accordingly so
that U̇ = U̇ev ⊕ U̇odd .

3.2. Recursive definition and closed form formulas. We have the following generalizations of the formulas for ıdivided powers developed in [BeW18]: the even ıπ -divided powers
(n)
B0̄ satisfy and are in turn determined by the following recursive relations:
(2a−1)

B · B0̄

(3.2)

(2a)

B · B0̄

(2a)

= [2a]B0̄

,
(2a+1)

= [2a + 1]B0̄

(2a−1)

+ [2a]J B0̄

for a ≥ 1.

,

where [n] := [n]q,π here denotes the (q, π)-integer; for the remainder of this section these
subscripts will be suppressed.
(n)
Analogously, the odd ıdivided powers B1̄ satisfy (and are determined by) the following
recursive relations:
(2a)

B · B1̄

for a ≥ 0.

Solving these recursive formulas, we arrive at the following closed form formulas:

Applying ς to (3.14), we end up with π ( 2 ) on the LHS and π (2)+( 2 ) on the RHS.

Dividing through by π ( 2 ) , we see that the powers of π inside the double sum work out to

Similarly for the odd power case (3.15), the powers of π in the double sum work out to
π c+a−a π c = 1. Thus, both formulas are identical to the non-super case in [BeW18, Prop 2.7].

4. A Serre presentation of Uı and a (q, π)-binomial identity
Let Uı = Uıς be an ıquantum group with parameter ς, for a given root datum (Y, X, h·, ·i, . . .).
Definition 4.1. For i ∈ I with τ i 6= i, imitating Lusztig’s divided powers, we define the
divided power of Bi to be
(4.1)

(m)

Bi

:= Bim /[m]!i ,

∀m ≥ 0,

when i 6= τ i.

For i ∈ I with τ i = i, the ıπ -divided powers are defined to be
(

When we specialize πi = 1 and Jei = 1, we obtain the ı-divided powers in [CLW18] from
the formulas above. In the case when the parameter ςi = qi−1 , this is the rank one case
(n)
described in §3, and all formulas and results there hold for Bi,p . In 4.3, we obtain Uı with
general parameters ςi from a special case by a rescaling isomorphism.
4.1. A Serre presentation of Uı . Denote
(a; x)0 = 1,

(a; x)n = (1 − a)(1 − ax) · · · (1 − axn−1 ),

∀n ≥ 1.

For Uı in the quantum covering setting, we have a Serre presentation result that parallels
the main result in [CLW18], Theorem 3.1: Fix pi ∈ Z2 for each i ∈ I.

A SERRE PRESENTATION FOR THE ıQUANTUM COVERING GROUPS

Theorem 4.2. The K(q)π -algebra Uı has a presentation with generators Bi , Jei (i ∈ I), Kµ
(µ ∈ Y ı ) and the relations (4.4)–(4.10) below: for µ, µ′ ∈ Y ı and i 6= j ∈ I,

A proof of Theorem 4.2 will be given in §4.6; first we will show that (4.9) and (4.10) holds
in Uı , in subsections §4.2 and §4.5 respectively).
Recall that a quasi-split ıquantum group Uı is split if τ = id. For split Uı , its Serre
presentation takes an particularly simple form, which we display here:
Theorem 4.3. Fix pi ∈ Z2 , for each i ∈ I. Then the split ıquantum group Uı has a Serre
presentation with generators Bi (i ∈ I) and relations

Moreover, U admits a K(q)-algebra anti-involution σ which sends Bi 7→ Bi for all i.
Proof. Follows from Theorem 4.2 by noting that Y ı = ∅ and τ i = i for all i ∈ I.



4.2. Serre relation when τ i 6= i. In this section we will show that (4.9) holds, following
[BK15, Section 3.5]. Recall the projections Pλ and π0,0 defined above, which are also in
[BK15].

Proof. Recall now that i and j = τ (i) 6= i must have the same parity, and if both i and j are
even roots there is nothing to prove. Thus, we may assume that i and j are odd roots, and

so by the bar-consistency condition m = 1 − aij is odd. Also set λij = m · i + j and with the
notation above set Q−λij = id ⊗ (P−λij ◦ π0,0 ) as the vector space endomorphism of U ⊗ U.
By a construction parallel to [Ko14, (7.8)], for Y = Fij (Bi , Bj ) we have the relation
Cij (c) = −(id ⊗ ε) ◦ Q−λij (∆(Y ) − Y ⊗ K−λij ).

(4.11)

Just as in loc. cit., we can compute ∆(Y ) from the formulas
∆(Bi ) = Bi ⊗ Ki−1 + 1 ⊗ Fi + ςi Zi ⊗ Ej Ki−1

∆(Bj ) = Bj ⊗ Kj−1 + 1 ⊗ Fj + ςj Zj ⊗ Ei Kj−1
where Zk = Jτ (k) Kτ (k) Kk−1 for k = i, j, and so we have that
Q−λij (∆(Y ) − Y ⊗ Kλij ) = (aj Bim−1 ςj Zj + ai Bim−1 ςi Zi ) ⊗ K−λij

(4.12)

where ai and aj can be determined explicitly using the commutation relations

4.3. Change of parameters. In [CLW18] (also cf. [Ko14, Theorem 7.1]), a change-ofparameters isomorphism is used to give a presentation of the ıquantum group Uıς,κ . In
particular, it is shown that the K(q)-algebra Uıς,κ (up to some field extension) is isomorphic
to Uıς ⋄ ,0 for some distinguished parameters ς ⋄ , i.e., ς ⋄ = qi−1 for all i ∈ I such that τ i = i (cf.
[Le02], [Ko14, Proposition 9.2]). The same argument carries over to the quantum covering
setting:
For given parameters ς satisfying (2.15)–(2.17), let ς ⋄ be the associated distinguished
parameters such that ςi⋄ = ςi if τ i 6= i, and
ςi⋄ = qi−1 , if τ i = i.

(4.16)

Let Uıς ⋄ be the ıquantum covering group with the parameters ς ⋄ = for all i ∈ I. Let
F = K(q)(ai | i ∈ I such that τ i = i) be a field extension of K(q), where
√
ai = qi ςi ,
(4.17)
∀i ∈ I such that τ i = i.
Denote by F Uıς = F ⊗K(q) Uıς the F-algebra obtained by a base change.
Proposition 4.5. There exists an isomorphism of F-algebras

if τ i 6= i,
if τ i = i;

φı : F Uıς ⋄ −→ F Uıς ,
Kµ 7→ Kµ ,

(∀i ∈ I, µ ∈ Y ı ),

In particular, this allows us to use the formulas for ıπ -divided powers in the previous
section, free of unwieldy coefficients.

will be crucial to the proof of Proposition 4.9 in the next section: for

When we specialize at π = 1, we have T (w, u, ℓ)q,1 = T (w, u, ℓ) as defined in [CLW18,

Proposition 4.6 ([CLW18], Theorem 3.6). The identity T (w, u, ℓ) = 0 holds, for all integers
w, u, ℓ as in (4.18).
As pointed out in [CLW18], a direct proof of this proposition proved challenging. Instead,
the authors approached this by first introducing a more general q-binomial identity in several
more parameters. This general identity specialized to the one above and satisfied certain
recurrence relations, thus completing the proof with an inductive argument (details in §5
of [CLW18]). Fortunately for us, we can sidestep the complicated process above for the
analogous result here in our setting by making a deft substitution and leveraging the earlier
result:
Proposition 4.7. The identity T (w, u, ℓ)q,π = 0 holds, for all integers w, u, ℓ as in (4.18).
√
Proof. By a substitution of q 7→ πq in T (w, u, l), we obtain
T (w, u, l)|q7→√πq =

√

π

u2 −lu−uw

T (w, u, ℓ)q,π ,

and so the result follows from Proposition 4.6.

4.5. Proof of the ıπ -Serre relations. This section is devoted to a proof of the following
theorem:

hold in the ıquantum covering group Uı .
The general strategy will rely on applying a few reductions to reduce (4.10) to the (q, π)binomial above, which vanishes as we saw in Proposition 4.7. Using the isomorphism φ
in Proposition 4.5, the ıSerre relations for Uıq−1 is transformed into the ıSerre relations
i
(4.10) for Uıς with general parameters. Hence just as in [CLW18], we will work with the
ıquantum groups with distinguished parameters, Uı = Uqi−1 , as a first reduction of the
ıSerre relations. A subsequent ‘reduction by equivalence’ as in §4.1 of [CLW18] can be
applied, further reducing (4.10) to
1−aij

for each p ∈ Z2 , where i ∈ I such that τ i = i, j 6= i.
Now fix i = 1 and j = 2. Note that when p(1) is even, there are no additional formulas to
prove since π1 = 1. Thus, we may assume that p(1) is odd, and so due to the bar-consistency
condition ([CHW13, 1.1(d)]) we must have a12 ∈ −2N. Hence, it is sufficient to prove that:

where S(y, u, ℓ, λ)π is a sum over n (with a difference when 2|n and 2 ∤ n as above ) and over
c, e, r ≥ 0, c + e + r = u cf. [CLW18, 4.16].
Then, using the new variables t := −u − y − e + c + n and w := 2m + 2 − 2λ − 2l − 4u − y
in §4.4 of [CLW18], we have that S(y, u, ℓ, λ)π = T (w, u, ℓ)q,π . Thus, the right-hand side
vanishes by Theorem 4.7 and so (4.21) holds.

Just as in [CLW18], a similar argument shows that (4.22) holds.
4.6. Proof of Theorem 4.2. We have a generalization of [Ko14, Theorem 7.1] when X
(corresponding to black nodes) is empty; the main ingredients are the results in §2.4 above.
Finally, the computation of the ‘Serre correction terms’ Cij is given by (4.9) and (4.10),
whose validity we have shown via Proposition 4.4 and Theorem 4.8.

4.7. Bar involution on Uı . Recall the three conditions (2.15)–(2.17) on ςi in Definition 2.2.
We may now conclude the existence of the bar involution for the quasi-split ıquantum group
Uı := Uıς , granting that these conditions on ςi are satisfied:
Proposition 4.10. Assume the parameters ςi , for i ∈ I, satisfy the conditions (2.15)–(2.17),
which we recall here:
(2.15) ςi qi = ςi qi , if τ i = i and aij 6= 0 for some j ∈ I \ {i};
(2.16) ςi = ςi = ςτ i , if τ i 6= i and ai,τ i = 0;
−a
(2.17) ςτ i = πi qi i,τ i ςi , if τ i 6= i and ai,τ i 6= 0.
Then there exists a K-algebra automorphism : Uı → Uı (called a bar involution) such that
q = q −1 ,

Kµ = Kµ−1 ,

Bi = Bi ,

∀µ ∈ Y ı , i ∈ I.

(n)

(n)

Proof. Under the assumptions, the ı-divided powers Bi in (4.1) and Bi,p , for p ∈ Z2 , in
(4.2)-(4.3) are clearly bar invariant. It follows by inspection that all the explicit defining
relations for Uı in (4.4)-(4.10) are bar invariant. The extra factor of πi in (c) comes from
applying to the right hand side of (4.9).

For the bar-involution defined above, we will construct a quasi K-matrix Υ and develop
a theory of canonical bases for Uı in a follow up [C19b] to this paper, cf. [BW18b, BW18c].
