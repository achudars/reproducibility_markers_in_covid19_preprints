PASSIVE LINEAR CONTINUOUS-TIME SYSTEMS:
CHARACTERIZATION THROUGH STRUCTURE

arXiv:1912.08249v3 [math.OC] 2 Oct 2020

IZCHAK LEWKOWICZ
Abstract. We here show that the family of finite-dimensional, continuous-time, passive, linear, time-invariant systems can be characterized through the structure of maximal
matrix-convex cones, closed under inversion. Moreover, this observation unifies three setups:
(i) differential inclusions,
(ii) matrix-valued rational functions,
(iii) realization arrays associated with rational functions.
It turns out that in the discrete-time case, the corresponding structure is of a maximal
matrix-convex set, closed under multiplication among its elements.

1. Introduction
In the study of dynamical systems, passivity is a fundamental property. Thus, it has been
extensively studied in various frameworks. For a modest sample of the vast literature on
the subject, see e.g. [6] [7], [12], [14]-[18], [22], [24], [33], [34], [38], [40] [42]-[44] and for
the infinite-dimensional case, see e.g. [11], [41] and [45].
Here we confine the discussion to finite-dimensional, linear time-invariant and continuoustime. Then, passive systems are modelled by Positive Real functions, denoted by PR,
namely (in scalar setup) rational functions which analytically map CR , the open right
half plane, to its closure CR . Namely the family of real scalar rational function f (s) of a
complex variable s, where Re(f ) ≥ 0, whenever Re(s) > 0.

For example, a scalar rational function of McMillan degree one, is positive real, if and
only if it is of the form of
b
s+a
(f (s), h(s) are PR functions of degree zero, when b = 0).

(1.1)

either f (s) = a + bs or h(s) = d +

b > 0, a, d ≥ 0.

The fact that the set PR may serve as a prototype model to continuous-time, linear,
passive systems is classical, see e.g. [7, Theorem 2.6.1], [12, Section 3.18], [38], [40] and
[43].
Probably the better known physical realization of PR functions is through electrical
circuits comprised of resistors, inductors and capacitors (R − L − C circuits). Specifically,
recall that in 1931 O. Brune, [16] showed the following:
The driving point immittance of a lumped1 R − L − C electrical network is a rational PR
function.
In 1949 R. Bott and R.J. Duffin, [14], showed that also the converse is true:
An arbitrary positive real rational function can be realized as the driving point immittance
of a lumped R − L − C electrical network.

For example, the rational function h(s) in Eq. (1.1) can be realized as the driving point
impedance of the simple circuit in Figure 1

Duality between rational positive real functions and the driving point immittance of
R − L − C electrical circuits, has already been long recognized, e.g. [16], [17], [18]. This
has lead to rich and well-established theory, see e.g. [7], [14], [12], [24], [28] and [45]. For
a recent comprehensive account of circuits describing PR functions of degree two, see
[38].
Already at this stage, note that the family PR is closed under the following operations:
(i) positive scaling, (ii) summation and (iii) inversion, see e.g. [28, Theorem 1.1].
In fact these operations have an electrical circuits interpretation:
Positive scaling −
transformer ratio
Summation
− series connection of impedances
Inversion
−
impedance/admittance.

[45].

of distributed R − L − C networks are associated with irrational PR functions, see e.g.

An alternative physical realization of PR functions is given by the classical analogy
between R − L − C electrical circuits and simple mechanical systems, see e.g.2 [40].

Following the above-mentioned intuition that the impedance of all single-input singleoutput R − L − C circuits forms a convex cone, closed under inversion, in a series of
papers [1], [2], [3], [4], [20], [21], [23], [32] and [36], we have explored the connection
between this structure and the family of finite-dimensional, continuous-time passive, linear
time-invariant scalar systems. In the sequel we show that the passage to multi-input multioutput R − L − C circuits, lead to the substitution of the notion of classical convexity by
(the more restrictive) matrix-convexity.
There has been characterizations of passive systems in various setups. As already mentioned, the list of references here is only a modest sample of the vast literature on the
subject. Probably the most intuitive description of passivity is based on the notion of
“storage function”, due to J.C. Willems, see e.g. [42].
Here we adopt a more abstract point of view and focus on the following question:
How can one characterize the family of finite-dimensional, continuous-time,
passive, linear time-invariant systems through the structure of the whole
set.
The answer is that this family forms a maximal matrix-convex cone, closed under inversion.
Moreover, this observation unifies three setups:
(i) Differential inclusions,
(ii) Positive real rational functions,
(iii) Families of realization arrays of positive real rational functions.
This work is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the first motivation: Stability
of differential inclusions. The background foundations of matrix-convex sets and cones,
to be used in the sequel, are laid in Section 3. Then this concept is applied to maximal
non-singular matrix-convex cones, closed under inversion: of (constant) matrices and of
matrix-valued rational functions, in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. At the second part of
Section 5 an application of the first part to the design of elaborate feedback-loop systems,
is introduced. Finally in Section 6 we explore realization arrays of families of systems.
2. stability of differential inclusions
As a first motivation we resort to the problem of stability of differential inclusions, see
e.g. [23], [37]. In engineers circles it is referred to as “robust exponential stability” (and
colloquially as “quadratic stability”).
2where

it is explained why “inerter” replaces “mass”.

For a set A = {A1 , . . . , Am } of n × n matrices let the differential inclusion,
dx
∈ Ax
x ∈ Rn ,
(2.1)
dt
mean that there exists an unknown selection A(t) ∈ A, t ≥ to and initial value x(to ) = xo ,
so that x(t) is a solution of the system
dx
(2.2)
= A(t)x(t)
x(to ) = xo , to ≥ 0.
dt
Although the precise nature of A(t) is not necessary for the sequel, yet for the sake of precision we adopt the following standard assumption: (i) All selections A(t) are Lebesgue measurable and locally integrable. Thus, piecewise constant and (other discontinuities) are
allowed. (ii) All solutions x(t) are absolutely continuous. (iii) The equality dx
= A(t)x(t)
dt
3
holds almost everywhere .
To state conditions for stability of the above differential inclusion we need to introduce
some notations: Hn will denote the set of (possibly singular) n × n Hermitian matrices
and Hn will be the subset of non-singular Hermitian matrices. The respective subsets of
positive (semi)-definite matrices are denoted by (Pn ) and Pn . Let also iHn be the set of
n × n Skew-Hermitian matrices.
Next, consider the set of n × n matrices A all satisfying a Lyapunov inclusion with the
same factor,
(2.3)

LH := {A : HA + A∗ H ∈ Pn }

prescribed

∗

LH := {A : HA + A H ∈ Pn }

H ∈ Hn .

Adopting the convention that Pn is the closure (in Hn ) of the open set Pn , one can say
that LH is the closure of the open set LH .
The following is well known, see e.g. [15, Section 5.1] and for a special case [23].
Observation 2.1. If for some −H ∈ Pn one has that LH from Eq. (2.3), is so that

(2.4)

then one can find α > 0 and
uniformly satisfies,
(2.5)

A ⊂ LH ,

β

≥ 1 so that the solution x(t) of the equation in (2.1)

α(t −t)
β kx(to )ke o

≥ kx(t)k

∀x(to )

∀t ≥ to ≥ 0.

The celebrated Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) technique4, see e.g. [15], [27], is the
prominent engineering tool to finding whether or not for A = {A1 , . . . , Am } there exists
H satisfying (2.4).
Already here we need to recall that the converse of Observation 2.1 is in general not true.
Namely Eq. (2.5) does not imply Eq. (2.4). For a special case where the two conditions
are equivalent see, [23].
We next start exploring the structure of the set LH .
3Under

this assumptions, for a particular selection, Eq. (2.2) is equivalent to the integral equation
Rt
x(t) = x(to ) + to A(τ )x(τ )d(τ ).

Definition 2.2. A set of n × n matrices is said to be a Convex Cone if it is closed under
positive scaling and summation.
A set of n × n matrices is said to be Invertible (=“closed under inversion”) if whenever
a matrix M in it is non-singular, its inverse M −1 , belongs to the same set.
A set of n × n matrices5 combining both properties is called a Convex Invertible Cone,
cic in short.

Example 2.3. 1. The set Hn of n × n non-singular Hermitian matrices is a cone, closed
under inversion, but not convex as ±H may belong to it, but not their sum6 .
2. The set of 2 × 2 matrices with det = 1 is closed under inversion, but not convex. Its
convex subset of matrices of the form ( 01 −1c ), c ∈ C, is not closed under inversion, as
−1
( 01 −1c ) = ( −1c 01 ).
3. The set Pn is a convex invertible cone, although it contains singular matrices.

The first fundamental structural result is the following, see e.g. [20, Lemma 3.5, Proposition 3.7].
Theorem 2.4. For arbitrary H ∈ Hn , the set LH in (2.3) is: A cone, closed under
inversion, contains the matrix H and a maximal open convex set of non-singular matrices.
Specifically, maximality is in the following sense: Whenever B 6∈ LH (i.e. B does not
belong to the closure of the open set LH ), it means that min λj (HB + B ∗ H) = −β for
j=1, ··· n

some scalar β > 0, then one can always find A ∈ LH so that A + B is singular.

Define now a matrix A := 12 H −1(βI + B ∗ H − HB). On the one hand A ∈ LH (i.e.
HA ∈ LI ), on the other hand,

H(A + B) = 12 (βI + B ∗ H − HB) + 12 (HB + B ∗ H − B ∗ H + HB) = 21 (βI + HB + B ∗ H),
|
{z
} |
{z
}
HA

HB

which by construction is a singular (Hermitian) matrix. Now as H is non-singular,
H(A + B) is singular if and only if, (A + B) is singular.

In [9, Section 3] T. Ando characterized the set LH for H ∈ Pn and in [10, Theorem 3.5]
he extended it to7 H ∈ Hn . In particular, he showed that the conditions in Theorem 2.4
fall short from characterizing the set LH , namely the converse statement is (significantly)
more involved.
Motivated by physical considerations, in this work we focus on the special case of the
set LH where H = I. Consequently, convexity in Theorem 2.4, can be substituted by
matrix-convexity, in Theorem 4.1 below.
3. matrix-convex sets and cones of matrices
We next resort to the notion of a matrix-convex set, see e.g. [25] and more recently, [26],
[30] and [39].
5Convex

Invertible Cones were originally defined over any real unital algebra, see [20], [22], [36]. For
simplicity of exposition, we here start with matrices.
6The set H of all n × n Hermitian matrices, will be addressed Observation 3.2.

7To be precise, the result is formulated for the Stein inclusion {A ∈ Cn×n : (H − A∗ HA) ∈ P },

Definition 3.1. a. A family of square matrices8 (of various dimensions) A, is said to
be matrix-convex of level n, if for all ν = 1, . . . , n,
for all natural k,

(3.1)

∀υj ∈Cηj ×ν

implies that
k
X

(3.2)

υj∗ Aj υj ,

j=1

belongs to A as well.
If the above holds for all n, we say that the set A is matrix-convex.
b.
A family of square matrices A is said to be matrix-convex cone if the right hand
side of Eqs. (3.1) is relaxed to be in Pν , with ν = 1, 2, . . .

Matrix-convex cones are closely related to the classical notion of Complete Positivity, see
e.g. [8], [19], and for a comprehensive account of the subject, see [13]. In recent years it
has been applied to the study of Quantum Channels, see e.g. [31].
We next present some prime examples of matrix-convex sets and cones. To this end,
recall that we denote by H the set of (possibly singular) Hermitian matrices. SkewHermitian matrices are denoted by, iH. It is common to consider H and iH as the
matricial extensions of R and iR, respectively.
Observation 3.2. (I) Each of the following families of matrices,
H,

iH ,

P,

P,

is a matrix-convex cone.
(II) A2 (α), (A2 (α)), the closed (open) family of square matrices whose spectral norm is
uniformly bounded (with a prescribed α > 0),
(3.3)

A2 (α) = { A :

α

≥ kAk2 },

A2 (α) = { A :

α

> kAk2 },

is a matrix-convex set.
Verification of (I) and (II) is self-evident and thus omitted.
In Observation 3.2 the sets Hn or Pn are replaced by H or P indicating that matrixconvexity is in principle dimension-free.
Substituting in Eq. (3.3) α = 1, one obtains the matrix-convex (closed) open contractions
(A2 (1)) and A2 (1), which are pivotal to discrete-time passivity, see [33].
8We

do not assume that A ⊂ H.

Remark 3.3. (i) Substituting in Eq. (3.2) k = 1, reveals that matrix-convexity in
particular implies that the set A is invariant under unitary similarity.
Thus in particular, in Eq. (3.3) the spectral norm k k2 , can not be substitute d by another
unitarily-variant, induced matrix norm e.g. k k1 or k k∞ .

(ii) Similarly, taking in Eq. (3.2), υj = rj Iνj where r1 , . . . , rk are arbitrary real scalars
so that r1 2 + . . . + rk 2 = 1, reveals that matrix-convexity in particular implies classical
convexity.
(iii) In light of the two above items, we here show convexity combined with closure
under unitary similarity, fall short from implying matrix-convexity: Consider the set of
positively scaled identity matrices, αI : α > 0 }. Trivially, this set is convex and each
matrix is invariant under unitary similarity. Yet this set is not matrix-convex. Indeed,
already for k = 2 and arbitrary α1 6= α2 ,

Hence, the set of scaled identity matrices is not matrix-convex.

4. Maximal non-singular matrix-convex cones, closed under inversion
As already mentioned, we here focus on the special case of the sets LH ( LH ) in Eq. (2.3),
where one substitutes H = I, i.e.
(4.1)

LI := {A : A + A∗ ∈ P }
LI

= {A : A + A∗ ∈ P }.

Note now that the sets in Eq. (4.1) may be viewed as a matricial extensions of CR , CR ,
respectively. Indeed, one can equivalently write these sets as,
(4.2)

LI = {P + iH : P ∈ P , H ∈ H}
LI = {P + iH : P ∈ P , H ∈ H}.

Under the assumption H = I, the stability of differential inclusion in Observation 2.1
takes the form
√ that Eq. (2.5) holds with β = 1 and the norm used is the spectral norm
(i.e. kxk2 = x∗ x).
Here is the first motivation to resorting to the notion of matrix-convexity.

Theorem 4.1. The following statements are true.
(i) The set LI in Eq. (4.1) is: A cone, closed under inversion, contains the matrix I
and a maximal open matrix-convex set of non-singular matrices.
(ii)

Conversely, a cone closed under inversion, containing the matrix I and a maximal
open convex set of non-singular matrices, which in addition is closed under unitary
similarity. is the set LI .

(iii) The set LI in (4.1) is a cone closed under inversion and a closed matrix-convex
set containing the matrix I, and on its boundary the matrix iI.

T
(iv) LI L−I = iH. The set iH is a matrix-convex cone, closed under inversion; in
fact, a maximal convex subset of Cn×n , which does not contain an involution.
Proof : (i) Almost all properties are obtained from Theorem 2.4, upon substituting
H = I. It is only matrix-convexity which is left to be shown.
Recall that from Eq. (4.2) it follows that for j = 1, . . . , k having Aj ∈ LI means that
Aj = Pj + iHj for some Pj ∈ P and some Hj ∈ H. In principle, matrix-convexity can
now be deduced from from item (I) of Observation 3.2. Still, we here write it explicitly,
for Aj ∈ LI ,

}

(ii) We shall show the converse in steps.
Step 1: We first show that the spectrum of each matrix in the set, is in CR .
Assume that there exists a non-singular matrix A in this set, so that (A − λI)v = 0 for
some9 0 6= v ∈ Cn and some λ ∈ CL . Then let A1 be the following convex combination
of A and A−1 ,
−1
|λ|2
1
.
A1 = 1+|λ|
2 A + 1+|λ|2 A
By construction (A1 − 2Re(λ)I)v = 0 with the same v.

Now if λ was on iR, then Re(λ) = 0 so A1 is singular and we are done. Hence, assume that
λ was in CL , i.e. 0 > Re(λ). Then for α = −2Re(λ) > 0, with the same v, (A1 + αI)v = 0,
so the matrix A1 + αI is singular.
Assume from now on that the spectrum of each matrix in the set, is in CR .
Step 2:
S Here are some facts on the sets of the form LH in Eq. (2.3) where H ∈ Pn .
(a)
LH , covers all matrices whose spectrum is in CR . In particular, each matrix
H∈P

whose spectrum is in CR belongs to (infinitely) many sets of the form LH .
(b) Each set of the form LH with H ∈ Pn contains the matrix I.
(c) By Theorem 2.4, each of the sets LH , H ∈ P, is a maximal open convex cone of
matrices whose spectrum is in CR .
1
1
(d) All these sets are similar, in the sense that, H 2 LH H − 2 = LI , see e.g. [20, Lemma
3.4].
Step 3: It is left to check which of the sets of the form LH with H ∈ Pn , is closed under
unitary similarity.
Recall (e.g. [20, Lemma 3.4]) that for a unitary matrix U and H ∈ Hn , both arbitrary,
one has that U ∗ LH U = LU ∗ HU . Thus to guarantee that U ∗ LH U = LH , one must take
H = ±In . To conform with previous steps, H = I, so this item is established.
(iii) This follows from the previous items along with the already mentioned fact that
LH is the closure of the open set LH for all H ∈ H, and in particular for H = I.
9As

before, matrix-convexity formulation is dimension-free. The introduction of 0 6= v ∈ Cn is only to
simplify the proof presentation.

We conclude this section by putting Theorem 4.1 into perspective:
1. In [5, Theorem 3.4], and further in [35, Section5], a quantitative refinement of items
(i), (ii) of Theorem 4.1, is introduced, where the (linear) Lyapunov inclusion in Eq. (2.3)
is substituted by a (quadratic) Hyper-Lyapunov inclusion.
2. As already mentioned, a complete characterization of the set LH for an arbitrary
H ∈ Hn , appeared in [10, Theorem 3.5]. The restriction in Theorem 4.1 to H = I enables
us, by resorting to the notion of matrix-convexity, to obtain a much simpler description
of LI , which in turn is exploited in presenting Positive Real functions, see Definition 5.2
below.
5. Maximal matrix-convex invertible cones of Rational Functions
As a first connection with the structure we focus on, we cite the following adapted version
of [22, Proposition 5.3.2].
Proposition 5.1. Let f (s) = 1s and g(s) ≡ 1 be a pair of scalar rational positive real
functions, of degree 1 and 0, respectively.
A scalar positive real rational function can always be generated by iteratively taking positive
scaling, summation and inversion of f (s) and g(s).
Thus, one can conclude that scalar rational PR functions may be viewed as cic (f, g) a
convex invertible cone generated by the above f (s) and g(s). An analogous observation
for state-space realization of the above f and g, will be given in Example 6.6 below.
The fact that in the scalar case, matrix-convexity degenerates to classical convexity, simplified the above discussion. We now proceed to matrix-valued rational functions.
Recall that LI is the matricial generalizations of CR . Thus, we find it convenient to
employ the terminology of Eq. (4.1) to describe matrix-valued Positive Real functions.
Definition 5.2. Let F (s) be an m × m-valued rational function so that F (s)|s∈R ∈ Rm×m .
S
F (s) is said to be Positive Real, denoted by PR, if it analytically maps CR to LIm ∞.

As already mentioned, this set of m×m-valued positive real rational functions corresponds
to the driving point immittance of a lumped R − L − C electrical networks, (along with
transformers) with m inputs and m outputs. To be precise, in the non-reciprocal case,
gyrators are needed as well.
Here is a fundamental structural property of this set.
Theorem 5.3. The family PR, of m × m-valued positive real rational functions, is a
cone, closed under inversion and a maximal matrix-convex family of functions which is
analytic in CR .
Conversely, a maximal matrix-convex cone of m × m-valued rational functions, analytic
in CR , containing the zero degree function Fo (s) ≡ Im , is the set PR.
Proof : Using the fact that all functions in PR analytically map CR to LIm , together
with item (i) of Theorem 4.1 establishes the sought structure.

10

I. LEWKOWICZ

For maximality, take a rational function G(s) which does not belong to PR. To avoid triviality, assume that it is analytic in CR , but there exists so ∈ CR so that (G(so )) v = (−a + iβ)v
for some a > 0, β ∈ R and 0 6= v ∈ Cm .
Note now that (with the same v), (G(s) + aIm )|so v = iβv and thus, (M + β 2 M −1 )v = 0,

M −1

{
( G(s) + aIm +β 2 (G(s) + aIm )−1 )|so v = 0.

This means that the rational function G(s) + aFo (s) + β 2 (G(s) + aFo (s))−1 , is within
cic(G, Fo ) (see Definition 2.2), and has a right-half plane zero at so and thus its inverse,
−1
,
G(s) + aFo (s) + β 2 (G(s) + aFo (s))−1

(still within cic(G, Fo )) is no longer analytic in CR . Hence, the claim is established.



Note that in principle the same proof applies to not necessarily rational PR function. A
scalar version of Theorem 5.3 appeared in [22, Proposition 4.1.1].
We here point out that in [5] a subset of PR functions which are associated with absolute
stability (a.k.a the Lurie problem) is studied. In scalar terminology, these are functions
mapping CR into a bounded disk within CR . Furthermore, under inversion this disk is
mapped onto itself.
We conclude this section by illustrating an application of Theorem 5.3. Here are the
details.

a feedback-loop network, transcends the realm of positive real functions. Next note that
the upper left corner of Eq. (5.3) explicitly says,

−1
−1
+ (Fc (s))−1 + Fd (s)
(5.4)
Out1|In2 ≡0 = (Fa (s))−1 + Fb (s)
In1 .
Employing again the map φ from Eq. (5.1), the relation in Eq. (5.4) can be compactly
written as,
Out1|In2 ≡0 = φ ( φ(Fc , Fd ), φ(Fa , Fb ) ) In1 .

Now, in comparison to Eq. (5.2), one can formally identify the elements sCa , sLb , sLc ,
sCd , in Figure 2 with the blocks Fa (s), Fb (s), Fc (s), Fd (s) in Eq. (5.4), respectively.
This calls for adapting one of the classical construction schemes of R − L − C circuits,
e.g. Brune, Bott-Duffin, Darlington, Foster, Cauer, etc. see e.g. [7], [14], [12], [24], [38],
[45], to introducing a design tool for networks of feedback-loops, more elaborate than that
in Figure 3 (and as mentioned, the building blocks need not be positive real).
A word of caution: The passage from one-port circuit design to that of feedback-loops
networks can not be straightforward: Typically blocks like Fa (s), Fb (s), Fc (s), Fd (s) are
non-commutative. Hence, one needs to formally introduce positive real rational functions of say k non-commuting variables, mapping LIn × · · · × LIn , to LIn , where n is a

k times

parameter. Further pursuing this direction is beyond the scope of this work.

Theorem 6.1. Let F (s) be an m × m-valued rational function with no pole at infinity
and let RF be a corresponding (n + m) × (n + m) state-space realization array, i.e.

then F (s) is positive real.
If the realization RF in Eq. (6.1) is minimal, i.e. n is the McMillan degree of F (s), then
the converse is true as well.
This result first appeared in [6]. The formulation used here is due to [43, Section 5], [44,
Section II]. For further details, see e.g. [1], [7, Chapters 5, 6] and [15, Subsection 2.7.2].
The formulation of Theorem 6.1, adapted from [43, Section 5], employs an elegant idea:
To treat the above (n + m) × (n + m) R as having two faces10: (i) of an array and (ii) of
a matrix. This will be further adopted in Theorem 6.5 below.
The following is classical.

In particular, this is the case when the realization RF in Eq. (6.1) is balanced.
In [44, Definition 3] a balanced realization of positive real system, satisfying Eq. (6.3), is
called “internally passive”.
Recall also that by definition, balanced realization implies minimality. However, as before,
the passage from Eq. (6.2) to Eq. (6.3), does not require minimality of realization.
To study families of realization simultaneously satisfying Theorem 6.1, we need to introduce a relaxed version of matrix-convexity (which is still more strict than classical
convexity).

Strictly speaking to conform with Definition 3.1, the block-diagonal isometries in Eq. (6.4)
should involve υj,ν ∈ Cnj ×ν and υj,µ ∈ Cmj ×µ where nj ∈ [1, . . . , ν] and mj ∈ [1, . . . , µ].
We compromized precision to simplify the notation.
Here is our first motivation to resorting to the notion of n, m-matrix-convexity,
Lemma 6.4. For all n, m = 1, 2, . . ., the sets (L −In

Theorem 6.5. Given a family of m×m-valued positive real rational functions of McMillan
degree, of at most, n, with no poles at infinity. Consider the corresponding (n+m)×(n+m)
realizations R in Theorem 6.1 and in Eq. (6.3).
Then (as matrices), this family of realizations is an n, m-matrix-convex cone, closed under
inversion.
The fact that this is a matrix-convex cone follows from Eqs. (6.1), (6.3) along with Lemma
6.4.
To show that this set is closed under inversion, note that assuming R is non-singular,
multiplying Eq. (6.3) by (R∗ )−1 and R−1 from the left and from the right respectively,
the resulting right-hand side is Q̂ := (R∗ )−1 QR−1 . Now if Q is in Pn+m , then so is Q̂.
Note that as before, in Theorem 6.5 we have not assumed minimality of realizations.
A different formulation (and a different proof) of this result, appeared in [34, Proposition
5.3].
To illustrate an application of Theorem 6.5 we next show how a set of of realization arrays,
may be parametrized by a pair of representatives.
Example 6.6. Recall that in
functions can be equivalently
now,

Rf =

which in turn is a (balanced) realization of the function h(s),
h(s) =

a, β, d ≥ 0.

Recall now that in Eq. (1.1) we pointed out that h(s) is a parametrization of all positive
real rational functions of degree of at most one, with no pole at infinity.

We conclude by summarizing in brief, that together with [33], we have shown above that,
