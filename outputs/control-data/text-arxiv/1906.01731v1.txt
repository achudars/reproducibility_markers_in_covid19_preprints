CONFORMAL GEOMETRY OF EMBEDDED MANIFOLDS WITH
BOUNDARY FROM UNIVERSAL HOLOGRAPHIC FORMULÆ

Abstract. For an embedded conformal hypersurface with boundary, we construct
critical order local invariants and their canonically associated differential operators.
These are obtained holographically in a construction that uses a singular Yamabe
problem and a corresponding minimal hypersurface with boundary. They include an
extrinsic Q-curvature for the boundary of the embedded conformal manifold and, for its
interior, the Q-curvature and accompanying boundary transgression curvatures. This
gives universal formulæ for extrinsic analogs of Branson Q-curvatures that simultaneously generalize the Willmore energy density, including the boundary transgression
terms required for conformal invariance. It also gives extrinsic conformal Laplacian
power type operators associated with all these curvatures. The construction also gives
formulæ for the divergent terms and anomalies in the volume and hyper-area asymptotics determined by minimal hypersurfaces having boundary at the conformal infinity.
A main feature is the development of a universal, distribution-based, boundary calculus
for the treatment of these and related problems.

1. Introduction
For closed, even dimension conformal manifolds, the study of Branson’s Q-curvature
invariant [B95] has been a major focus in areas including conformal geometry, geometric
analysis and physics, see for example [Cha97, Mal98, HS98, GrW99, And01, FG02, FH03,
Cha08, Cha081, DM08, BJ10, FG12]. Partly motivating these studies is the result that
the integral of the Q-curvature over the manifold is a global conformal invariant. The
e with boundary ∂ Σ
e = Λ, is given by a
analog for a dimension d − 1 > 2 manifold Σ
Q-curvature–transgression pair (Q, T ) where

is then a global conformal invariant [Cha97] (see for example [Cha081, Ndi08, Cas18,
GP18] for subsequent T -curvature studies). Any attempt to handle these objects using
standard Levi-Civita calculus is immediately frustrated by the fact that (i) the formulæ
are extremely complicated and (ii) the indirect definition of the Q-curvature. An aim of
the current work is to solve this problem. In fact, we will treat a generalization.
It has emerged recently that there is a nice link between Q-curvature and the Willmore energy as well as its higher dimensional analogs. This is in the form of a hierarchy
where for conformally embedded hypersurfaces there is a curvature quantity, also denoted Q, that gives a Willmore-type energy density for hypersurfaces which specializes
e
to the usual Branson Q-curvature for suitable even-dimensional embeddings. When Σ

is the boundary of any conformal compactification, the Q-curvature generalizes canonically [GW14]. In the case when the conformal compactification obeys a suitable singular Yamabe problem [ACF92], this Q-curvature is a distinguished, extrinsically coupled
curvature invariant, determined by the conformal embedding and a choice of boundary metric with integral again a conformal invariant. (See also [Maz91] for a general
e is a surface, the integral of this extrinsic
study of singular Yamabe problems.) When Σ
Q-curvature is the Willmore energy functional; in general this provides a higher dimensional analog [GW13, GW15, GW16b, Gra16, GW16a]. The Willmore functional plays
an important rôle in both mathematics and physics (see e.g. [Riv08, Pol86, AM10]); recently the celebrated Willmore conjecture [Wil65] concerning absolute minimizers of this
energy was settled in [Mar14]. The Willmore energy is also linked to physical observables [GrW99] and in particular entanglement entropy [RT06, RT061]. We expect higher
Willmore energies to be similarly important.
Recently the existence of a corresponding canonical, transgression for the extrinsic Qcurvature was established [GW19]. Once again, the Levi-Civita and its accompanying
Gauß–Codazzi–Ricci extrinsic calculus are inadequate for developing a general theory.
We also treat this problem.
We attack all these problems holographically. This term originated in physics [tHo93,
Sus95] where it was concretely realized in the AdS/CFT correspondence of [Mal98].
This relates spacetime theories to theories living on the boundary of spacetime. Here
e will be studied by embedding it in a conformal
this means that the geometry of Σ
manifold M of one dimension higher. The gain is simple formulæ on M that encode
e these simple formulæ
the complicated information of (Q, T )-pair; upon restriction to Σ
produce the quantities of interest.
The Branson Q-curvature was initially defined as an intrinsic quantity. However, the
holographic approach is a natural setting to study a generalizing analog that includes
extrinsic embedding data, and for this extrinsic Q-curvature, the corresponding transe with boundary Λ, we consider a conformal embedding, as
gression T . For a manifold Σ
depicted below:
e
Σ

,→ (M, c)
Λ
Thus we study the sequence of submanifold embeddings
Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c) ,
where M is a dimension d conformal manifold, Σ is a hypersurface (meaning dimene
sion d − 1), Λ is a closed hypersurface in Σ (so dim(Λ) = d − 2) with interior Σ.
Throughout this paper we assume d > 3 (the cases d = 1, 2 are easily handled by more
naïve methods). To facilitate the study of these embeddings we consider two classical
PDE problems:
First, the data of the conformal embedding Σ ,→ M determines an approximate metric g o that is singular along Σ. Given g ∈ c, then g o = σ −2 g; this is determined
canonically up to terms of order σ d where σ is a defining function for Σ (meaning that Σ
is the zero locus of σ and dσ|Σ 6= 0). This is achieved via a singular Yamabe problem

4

which requires the scalar curvature to obey
o

Sc g = −d (d − 1 ) + O(σ d ) .
Second, the singular metric g o can be used to determine the asymptotics of a hypero
surface Ξ anchored along Λ (so ∂Ξ = Λ that is minimal so that its mean curvature HΞg
vanishes, again to some order in σ:
o

HΞg = O(σ d−1 ) .
We term Ξ an asymptotically minimal hypersurface. Furthermore, the defining function µ
for Ξ can be canonically determined up to terms of order µd by the singular Yamabe
problem for the embedding Ξ ,→ M . This geometry is depicted below:

This set-up allows us to study the embedding sequence Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c) holographically.
The above geometry was partly inspired by seminal work of Graham and Witten
[GrW99] (see also [GR17]) who study the embedding of closed submanifolds in Σ by
considering the volume asymptotics of a minimal submanifold in M whose boundary is
the given submanifold in Σ. For this they considered the special case where the metric
g o obeys a Poincaré–Einstein condition; this effectively removes the information of the
embedding Σ ,→ (M, c). In Section 3 we further develop the theory of aymptotically
minimal hypersurfaces, including results of independent interest.
e close off a
Returning to our general setting, note that even in the case that Ξ and Σ

compact region D, the volume of this is infinite with respect to g . Nevertheless, in the
case of any suitably singular measure such as the one of g o , there is a notion of a regulated
volume Volε . This is defined by the volume of a one parameter family of regions Dε ⊆ D
approximating that enclosed and such that D0 = D. (See Equation (4.1) and preceding
text for the precise definition of the regulated volume.) The asymptotic behavior of Volε
is then given by

vk
+ V log ε + Volren +O(ε) ,
Volε =

k=d−1

with details as follows: The coefficients of the poles in ε are local integrals (meaning
their integrands are functions determined by finitely many jets of the given data) along
e = Σ ∩ D, these poles are termed divergences. These depend on the choice of reguΣ
lating regions Dε ; we give universal holographic formulæ for them in Theorem 6.1. The
constant term Volren is called the renormalized volume. The coefficient V of the logarithm is the volume anomaly. It is the non-derivative term in an anomaly operator (see

Conformal geometry of embedded manifolds

5

for example [GW19]) that measures the dependence of the renormalized volume on the
choice of regulator and hence the metric in cΣ . Here cΣ is the conformal class of metrics
induced on Σ by c. The volume anomaly is conformally invariant and expressed as a sum
e and Λ = ∂ Σ.
e In fact, distinguished integrands are canonically
of local integrals along Σ
determined by our construction and give the extrinsic Q-curvature and corresponding
transgression introduced above. As discussed above, explicit formulæ for Q-curvatures
and their extrinsic generalizations explode in complexity beyond the simplest low dimensional examples (see [GP03]). However, our first main theorem establishes that these
have remarkably simple and universal holographic formulæ in all dimensions.
In the following theorem we determine the regulated region Dε by introducing a
nowhere vanishing positive conformal density τ , termed a true scale or regulator. This
additional data can be used to determine a metric in c, and hence an induced metric
along Σ. These notions are explained in Sections 2.1 and 4.

where (Q, T ) are local (density-valued) curvatures depending on the regulator τ and the
conformal embeddings indicated. Given unit and minimal unit conformal defining densities σ and µ for Σ and Ξ, respectively, these have holographic formulæ

In the above, the conformal densities σ and µ obey a unit and minimal unit property.
This means that σ = στ and µ = µτ with τ = [g; 1], where g, σ and µ obey the singular
Yamabe and minimal hypersurface conditions that we just defined. The logarithm of a
0 are all variants
conformal density is defined in Sections 2.1. The operators Lσ , LTσ and Lµ
of the Laplace–Robin operator; these are distinguished Laplacian-type operators on the
manifold M that are degenerate along boundaries Σ, Λ or Ξ respectively, where they
become the conformally invariant Robin-type combination of Dirichlet and Neumann
operators of Cherrier [Che84], see Sections 2.4 and 5.2. Theorem 6.1 gives analogous
results for the divergences in the regulated volume.
A nice feature of this set-up is that it encodes a second geometric problem of independent interest (see [GrW99]). Namely, the corresponding “area” of the minimal hypersurface Ξ (meaning its volume with respect to the induced singular metric; throughout
we use “volume” to refer to volumes of codimension zero regions and “area” for volumes
of codimension one regions) is also infinite, but again can be regulated using the same
method as employed above for the volume problem. Here also the family of regulating
regions Ξε ⊂ Ξ are described in terms of the true scale τ . The details of this construction
may be found in Section 4. The asymptotic behavior of their areas is then given by
1

where the coefficients of poles are regulator-dependent local integrals over Λ = Σ ∩ Ξ;
we give universal holographic formulæ for them in Theorem 6.2. The constant term
Arearen is the renormalized area. The coefficient A of the logarithm is the area anomaly.

It also measures the response of the renormalized area to the choice of regulator and is
itself conformally invariant. The integrand also generalizes Branson’s Q-curvature to this
structures to what we shall call a submanifold Q-curvature. Even for the case where Λ is
a four-manifold and M is specialized to be Poincaré–Einstein, the classical treatment of
this requires a computational tour de force [GR17]. Our next theorem gives a universal
holographic formula for the area anomaly.

Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c) and is conformally invariant. For any regulator τ , it is given by

Λ

,

where σ and µ are unit and minimal unit conformal defining densities for Σ and Ξ,
respectively.
The proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are given in Section 6.2. Key to these proofs is
a calculus, both integral and differential, for conformal geometries coupled to multiple
scales; this is described in Section 5.
A strong motivation for our work is that the volume and area problem not only leads to
interesting global conformal invariants of the structure Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c), but also yields
a rich local invariant theory surrounding the Q and T integrands. Of particular interest
are conformally invariant differential operators that measure how Q and T curvatures
depend on the choice of metric in the conformal class. For the special case of Branson’s
Q-curvature, these are the (critical) conformally invariant Laplacian powers of [GJMS92].
Their generalizations follow immediately from our construction upon remembering that
the choice of regulator τ also amounts to a choice of metric g ∈ c and that log(ef τ ) = f +
log τ for any smooth function f . For example, the extrinsic Q-curvature of Σ ,→ (M, c)
obeys

member of a sequence of conformally invariant extrinsically coupled Laplacian powers,
as described by simple holographic formulæ in the next Theorem.

Because the extrinsic Q-curvature pairs with a transgression T for manifolds with
boundary, the critical extrinsic Laplacian power PΣ pairs with a conformally invariant

The simple holographic formulæ for the (Q, T )-curvature pair of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2
explode in complexity when expressed in terms of standard Riemannian invariants along Σ

data for the sequence of hypersurface embeddings Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c) in higher dimensions
but where Riemannian formulæ are unwieldy, one can employ our holographic formulæ
and computer software to compute these curvatures and operators. Examples of how to
set up this kind of computation are given in [GW16a, GW19]. When the bulk M is a
three or four-manifold, explicit Riemannian formulæ are still relatively compact; these
are given in following pair of theorems, the first of which gives the volume expansion, its
anomaly and related curvatures and invariant operators. Any new notations appearing
in these two theorems as well as their proofs are given in Section 8.

Many of our constructions and results have origins in tractor calculus techniques for
hypersurfaces, see in particular [GW15, GW16b]. They allow the Laplace–Robin technology to be extended to any conformally compact structure as well as to higher rank
tensors. Moreover, these techniques suggest a natural generalization of our method to
problems involving higher codimension embeddings; the key is to develop suitable analogs
of the tangential Laplace–Robin operator LTσ . We plan to present the details of a higher
codimension tractor calculus for conformally embedded submanifolds and related volume
and area problems in a separate manuscript.
1.1. Conventions. We employ the notation M d to indicate the dimension d of a smooth
manifold M and drop the superscript when this is clear from context. The Euler characteristic of a manifold M is denoted by χM , and the exterior derivative is denoted by d.
When M is equipped with a metric g, the corresponding volume element is denoted dVg .
We will often employ an abstract index notation for tensors on M , where for example,
v a denotes a section of T M but no choice of coordinates is implied (see, for example [PR84]). Canonical operations such as contraction of a vector field v a and a one-form
ωa ∈ Γ(T ∗ M ), are then given by expressions such as v a ωa . In this notation the squared
length |v|2g of a vector v a with respect to a metric g is v a gab v b , but we will often abbreviate this quantity by v 2 . In the same vein, u.v denotes gab ua v b = g(u, v). Throughout
we work with Euclidean signature metrics, but many of our results generalize directly to
a pseudo-Riemannian setting. The Levi–Civita connection of a metric g is denoted ∇g
(again the superscript g will be dropped when context makes this clear). The Riemann
tensor R of ∇ is defined by R(u, v)w = ∇u ∇v w − ∇v ∇u w − ∇[u,v] , where [·, ·] is the Lie
bracket and u, v, w are arbitrary vector fields. In the abstract index notation R is denoted
by Rab c d and the Ricci tensor is Rab a d =: Ric bd . In d > 3 dimensions, this is related to the
Schouten tensor P by the trace-adjustment Ric ab = (d−2)Pab +gab J, where J := Paa and
the scalar curvature Sc = Ric aa = 2 (d −1 )J . When d = 2, we define J := 12 Sc. In dimensions d > 4, the Weyl tensor is defined by Wabcd = Rabcd −Pac gbd +Pbc gad −Pbd gac +Pad gbc .
2
Moreover W Ω gab c d = W gab c d for any smooth function Ω. As for the quantity zero, we
denote 0! = 1 and any operator A raised to the zeroth power is the identity map: A0 = Id.
2. The Calculus of Scale
An effective method for handling geometric problems holographically is to treat the
bulk as a conformal manifold. In this approach, asymptotically hyperbolic (or anti
de Sitter) metrics are treated as a coupling of conformal geometry to a singular scale.
This allows us to utilize potent hidden symmetries because the bulk conformal structure
extends smoothly to the boundary even when the hyperbolic metric does not.

2.1. Conformal geometry. A conformal manifold (M d , c) is a manifold equipped with
a conformal class of metrics
c := [g] = [Ω2 g] ,
where Ω is any smooth, strictly-positive function. Conformal densities are fundamental
objects on conformal manifolds: A (conformal) density of weight w ∈ R is a double
equivalence class of metrics and smooth functions defined by
ν := [g; ν] = [Ω2 g; Ωw ν] .
Conformal densities may also be treated as sections of the line bundle EM [w] induced
from the corresponding R+ representation where one views the conformal structure as a
ray subbundle of 2 T ∗ M and in turn as an R+ principal bundle over M [GP03, CG03].
Weight zero densities f = [g; f ] = [Ω2 g; f ] may be treated as functions and thus we
often use the notation f for these. We will also be interested in operators between
sections of line bundles A : Γ(EM [w1 ]) → Γ(EM [w2 ]). In this case we will refer to the
difference w2 − w1 =: w(A) as the operator weight of A and also use the terminology
“A is an operator of weight w2 − w1 ”. We also need the notion of a log density. These are
(see [GW14]) equivalence classes of functions defined by an additive R+ representation
λ = [g; λ] = [Ω2 g; λ + ` log Ω] .
The number ` is called the (log)-weight of λ. A log density is a section of a log-density
bundle FM [`] for some ` ∈ R. A more detailed description of the algebra and calculus
of conformal densities and their tensor analogs may be found in [GW14, GW16a]. For
example, v a = [g; v a ] ∈ Γ(T M [w]) denotes a vector-valued density of weight w and its
corresponding section space.
When τ = [g; τ ] is a weight w = 1 density and the smooth function τ is strictly
positive, we call τ a true scale. Given this, we can define a weight ` = 1 log-density
log τ := [g; log τ ] and any weight ` = 1 log density can be written this way for some true
scale.
A true scale canonically determines a Riemannian geometry (M, gτ ) via the equivalence class representative τ = [gτ ; 1]. Conversely, given a true scale τ and a density f ,
this canonically determines a function f by expressing f = [gτ , f ]. Thus one may also
regard a true scale as a choice of metric gτ ∈ c. Alternatively, defining (tautologically)
the symmetric cotensor-valued conformal metric gab = [g; gab ] ∈ Γ( 2 T ∗ M [2]) (which
we denote by g in an index-free notation), the metric given by the choice of scale τ is
g
gτ = 2 .
τ
It is often propitious to perform computations involving densities by making such a
choice, we shall term this operation working in a scale and label it either by a choice of
metric or a true scale, and use unbolded symbols for the corresponding equivalence class
representatives for densities. Similarly, an unbolded notation will be used for operators
acting on densities when a choice of scale has been made. Once a scale been chosen we
may (or may not according to convenience) use this to trivialize density bundles.
For submanifolds embedded in a conformal manifold, density bundles of the induced
conformal structure agree with the restriction of ambient density bundles of the same
weight. We shall use this frequently without further mention.
2.2. Defining densities. The data of a conformal manifold and a true scale is equivalent
to a Riemannian geometry. The situation becomes far more interesting when one admits
scales with a non-trivial zero locus.

Given an embedded hypersurface Σ ,→ M , a defining density σ is a weight w = 1
density σ = [g; σ ] with zero locus
Z(σ) := {p ∈ M | σ(p) = 0} = Σ ,
and such that dσ(p) 6= 0, ∀p ∈ Σ (so the function σ is a defining function for Σ). For a
given hypersurface a defining density always exists locally.
A defining density defines a Riemannian metric g o via σ = [g o ; 1] away from the zero
locus Σ where g o is singular. The scalar curvature of this singular metric is determined
by the conformal metric g and the defining density σ = [g; σ] through the weight zero
density

(2.1)

termed the S-curvature. Here ∆ denotes the (negative energy)
 Laplacian of g and J is
the multiple of scalar curvature given by J := Scg / 2(d − 1) (here and elsewhere we
will drop super and subscripts g and σ when these are clear from context). Away from Σ
(and up to a negative multiplicative constant) the S-curvature is the of g o ,
o

Scg = −d(d − 1)S σ .
o

This shows that the scalar curvature Scg of the metric g o extends smoothly to Σ,
where g o is singular.
When working in a scale g, we will denote n := dσ and
1
ρσ := − (∆g + J)σ .
d
The S-curvature [g; S] is then given by the function
(2.2)

S = n2 + 2ρσ .

Hence, along the hypersurface Σ, the S-curvature determines the length of the conormal n and S σ is necessarily non-vanishing in a neighborhood of Σ. Since our considerations concern such a neighborhood, throughout and without loss of generality we assume
that S σ is everywhere non-vanishing.
2.3. The singular Yamabe problem. Every Riemannian metric g on a closed manifold M can be conformally rescaled to one of constant scalar curvature [Tru68, Sch84,
2
Au76], and the problem of finding Ω ∈ C ∞ M such that Sc Ω g is constant is termed
the Yamabe problem [Yam60]. Compact manifolds with boundary and a singular metric
g o = g/σ 2 , where the boundary and singularity of g o of M are given by the zero locus of
the defining function σ ∈ C ∞ M , are termed conformally compact. A Yamabe-type problem for the metric g o was considered in [ACF92]. Such and related problems were called
the singular Yamabe problem in [Maz91]. When the metric g o is in addition Einstein
on M \∂M , we say that (M, g o ) is Poincaré–Einstein.
Actually it will be convenient to consider conformal manifolds (M, c) with defining
density σ for an embedded, oriented, separating hypersurface Σ. On each side of Σ, the
defining density gives a canonical singular metric g o via σ = [g o ; 1]; or equivalently
g
go = 2 .
σ
The hypersurface Σ is termed a conformal infinity for the metric g o and we may again
ask whether there exists a defining function for Σ such that its singular metric has
constant scalar curvature. We shall also use the singular Yamabe problem moniker for
this problem.

12

Arias, Gover & Waldron
o

Whether Σ is a boundary component or hypersurface, the requirement that Sc g is
constant may be phrased in terms of the S-curvature. In particular, for negative constant
scalar curvature equaling −d(d − 1) we must solve
(2.3)

Sσ = 1 ,

for σ given Σ ,→ (M, c). Of relevance to us here is that this problem is intimately related
to the study of invariants of the conformal embedding Σ ,→ (M, c) (see [GW13, GW15,
GW16b]). Indeed, as demonstrated in [ACF92] (see also [GW15]) the singular Yamabe
problem cannot in general be solved smoothly, but rather is obstructed. However there
does exist an asymptotic solution for σ such that
(2.4)

S σ = 1 + σdF ,

where F is a smooth, weight −d density known as the obstruction density. The quantity FΣ = F |Σ is a non-trivial invariant of Σ ,→ (M, c). When M is a conformal
three-manifold this gives the Willmore invariant which is the functional gradient of the
Willmore energy functional [GW13]. A defining density solving Equation (2.4) is termed
a (conformal) unit defining density. Unit defining densities always exist and are unique
up to addition of terms σ d+1 A =: O(σ d+1 ) where A is any smooth weight −d density.
In general, given any weight one density ν, we use the notation O(ν k ) to denote ν k A
where A is any smooth density of the appropriate weight and tensor type determined by
context.
2.4. The Laplace–Robin operator. Natural Laplace-type equations on conformal geometries coupled to scale enjoy a hidden solution generating algebra [GW14]. To uncover
this, inspired by the tractor calculus based approach of [Gov07, GSW08, GW14], we introduce an operator that combines a bulk Laplace operator and a conformally invariant
boundary operator:
Let σ = [g; σ] be a weight 1 density. Then the corresponding Laplace–Robin operator
Lσ : Γ(EM [w]) −→ Γ(EM [w − 1]) ,
maps weight w densities to weight w − 1 densities f = [g; f ] according to


(2.5)
Lσ f := g; (d + 2w − 2)(∇n + wρ)f − σ(∆ + wJ)f .
The Laplace–Robin operator also maps weight ` log-densities λ to weight −1 densities:


(2.6)
Lσ λ := g; (d − 2)(∇n λ + `ρ) − σ(∆λ + `J) .
It is not difficult to verify that if the log density λ = log(ef τ ) where τ > 0 is a density
of any non-vanishing weight, and f ∈ C ∞ M , then
Lσ log(ef τ ) = Lσ log τ + Lσ f ,
where the right hand side is computed using the definitions given in Equations (2.5)
and (2.6).
The operator Lσ is a Laplacian-type operator that is degenerate along the zero locus
of σ. It arises naturally in a tractor calculus description of (pseudo)Riemannian geometries and related physical wave equations from a conformal perspective [Gov07, GSW08].
In the case that σ is a defining density for a hypersurface Σ, this operator restricted to Σ
is proportional to a conformally invariant Robin-type (i.e., Dirichlet plus Neumann) operator along the corresponding hypersurface Σ. When the defining density additionally

densities f = [g; f ], along Σ one has

Σ

=: δΣR f .

The operator δΣR is well-defined by the above display for all weights w, and is termed
the conformal Robin operator [Che84]. Here n̂ is the unit conormal to Σ, and H g is the
mean curvature of Σ with respect to the metric g. The quantity δΣR f is an example of a
conformal hypersurface invariant. These are invariants of the conformal embedding Σ ,→
(M, c). The precise definition is given in [GW15, Section 6.1]. We use a boldface notation
˚Σ ∈
for these invariants, other examples include the trace-free second fundamental form II
ab
Γ( 2 T ∗ Σ[1]) of the hypersurface Σ and its unit conormal n̂a ∈ Γ(T ∗ Σ[1]).
Away from the hypersurface Σ, when computed in the scale g o corresponding to the
scale σ, the Laplace–Robin operator gives the Laplacian-type operator

where ∆o is the Laplacian of the singular metric g o and similarly for J o . Moreover,

any conformal class of metrics c, the operator triple (x, h, y) obeys the standard sl(2)
commutator relations
[h, x] = 2x , [y, h] = 2y .

In particular, we will rely heavily on the U sl(2) enveloping algebra identities

Arias, Gover & Waldron

Observe that acting on densities of weight w = 12 (k − d − 1), the right hand side of the
second identity above vanishes, which implies that the operator y k acting on densities f
of weight 21 (k − d + 1) has the special property
y k (f + σf 0 )|Σ = y k f |Σ ,
where here f 0 is any smooth density of weight 12 (k − d − 1). So along Σ, the action of y k
is independent of the choice of extension f of the boundary data f |Σ . We encode this
notion in a general definition:
Definition 2.1. Let A : Γ(EM [w]) → Γ(EM [w0 ]). Then we call the operator A tangential to Σ = Z(σ) if it obeys
(2.11)

A(f + σf 0 )|Σ = Af |Σ ,

for any f ∈ Γ(EM [w]) and f 0 ∈ Γ(EM [w − 1]).
For operators acting on log-densities, we say A : Γ(FM [1]) → Γ(EM [w]) is tangential
to Σ when for any true scale τ ,


A log(f τ ) |Σ = A log(τ ) |Σ ,
for all 0 < f ∈ C ∞ M such that f |Σ = 1.
Remark 2.2. Since f and f 0 are smooth and A is linear, the requirement in Equation (2.11) can be restated as
A(σf 0 ) = σh ,
for some smooth h ∈ Γ(EM [w0 − 1]), and analogously for operators on log densities.
Tangential operators are useful for expressing operators along Σ holographically because,
as a consequence of the above definition, a tangential operator A defines an operator
A : Γ(EΣ[w]) → Γ(EΣ[w0 ])
according to
Af := Afext

Σ

,

where fext is any smooth extension of f ∈ Γ(EΣ[w]) to M .
Definition 2.1 and its consequences remarked upon above, extend naturally to higher
codimension embedded submanifolds. In particular for a codimension two embedded
submanifold Λ defined as the zero locus of a pair of defining densities σ and µ, we
require
A(f + σf 0 + µf 00 )|Λ = Af |Λ ,
for any f 0 , f 00 ∈ Γ(EM [w − 1]). We call such operators tangential to Λ = Z(σ, µ); they
define operators Γ(EΛ[w]) → Γ(EΛ[w0 ]). We will also encounter the intermediate case
where tangentiality of an operator only holds along a hypersurface Λ ,→ Σ with respect
to a single defining function σ, so that
A(f + σf 0 )|Λ = Af |Λ ,
for any f 0 ∈ Γ(EM [w − 1]). Here we will say that A is tangential to Σ along Λ. This
defines a conformally invariant operator along Λ that may take derivatives in directions
normal to the embedding of Λ in Σ. When Λ is the intersection of two hypersurfaces Σ
and Ξ, tangentiality to Σ along Λ and tangentiality to Ξ along Λ together imply tangentiality to Λ.

2.5. Leibniz rules. Because it is a scale-coupled conformal analog of the Laplace operator, the Laplace–Robin operator does not obey the Leibniz rule when acting on products
of densities. To handle this feature we proceed as follows. For weight w 6= 1 − d2 densities f and weight ` log densities λ we define
(

In the case that w = w0 = 1 we will often use an unbolded notation for the resulting
function-valued symmetric bracket. Indeed, when σ and µ are defining densities for
hypersurfaces Σ and Ξ intersecting along a codimension two submanifold Σ ∩ Ξ, then
hσ, µi

computes the cosine of the angle between the respective conormals to Σ and Ξ. Note
also that
hσ, σi = S σ .
Moreover, when f has weight w 6= 1 − d2 , it follows that
(2.15)

bσf .
hσ, f i = L

We will also need analogs of the generalized Leibniz rule (2.13) at certain critical
weights. First, when w + w0 = 1 − d2 but w 6= 1 − d2 6= w0 we have
(2.16)

Lσ (f f 0 ) = −2σhf , f 0 i .

The case when w = 1 − d2 6= w0 , w + w0 is more delicate. For that we focus on the case
that σ is a defining density for a hypersurface Σ. Then we observe that the space of
equivalence classes with respect to the equivalence f ∼ f +σf 0 for any f 0 ∈ Γ(EM [w−1]),
denoted by

(2.17)
ΓΣ (EM [w]) := [f ] : f ∈ Γ(EM [w]) ,
is congruent to the space Γ(EM [w]) of conformal densities along the hypersurface with
conformal class of metrics cΣ induced by c. Observe that operators that are tangential
along Σ are canonically well-defined on the space ΓΣ (EM [w]).
Now we note that along the hypersurface Σ, the operator ∇n + (1 − d2 )ρσ is the
conformal Robin operator δΣR at the weight 1 − d2 . Therefore we have the following

In the last expression in the above display we have used the square brackets to indicate
equivalence classes with respect to both metric rescalings and the addition of smooth
terms proportional to σ.
Given a defining density µ = [g; µ] for a second hypersurface Ξ, it is possible to build
invariant operators along Ξ from combinations and compositions of representatives of the
e σ and L
e µ , as well as analogs for the bracket of Equation (2.14). A key example
operators L

with domain Γ(EM [1 − 2 ]). This can be made well-defined with codomain ΓΣ (EM [− d2 ])
by suitably interpreting the second term, which in any case does not contribute. In
fact, one can also make it well-defined with codomain ΓΞ (EM [− d2 ]) via a continuation
argument in the weight w by simultaneously using the corresponding representatives of
the two tilded operators. Indeed there is a pole 1/(d + 2w − 2) when extending the
b defined in Equation (2.12) to the critical weight w = 1 − d , but this then

2.6. Distributions and integral theory. A weight w = −d density f = [g; f ] can
be invariantly integrated over a conformal d-manifold (or some region D ⊂ M thereof)
since the volume element dV g of g ∈ c defines a weight d measure-valued density [g; dV g ].
Thus we define the conformally invariant integral of f over D by
ˆ
ˆ
f :=
dV g f .
D

D

Given a hypersurface Σ ,→ M and a function fΣ ∈ C ∞ Σ, it is propitious to treat the
integral of fΣ over Σ in terms of a defining function σ for Σ. In particular, given g ∈ c,
we have (see, for example, [OF03] or [GGHW15])
ˆ
ˆ
gΣ

dV fΣ =
dV g |dσ|g δ(σ)f .

M

In the above display, gΣ is the metric along Σ induced by g, f denotes any (smooth)
extension of fΣ to M and δ(σ) is the Dirac-delta distribution.
The distributional identity δ(Ωσ) = Ω−1 δ(σ) (valid for any 0 < Ω ∈ C ∞ M ) implies
that if σ = [g; σ] is any weight w = 1 density, then
δ(σ) := [g; δ(σ)]
is a weight w = −1 distribution-valued conformal density (see [GW16a] for details). Thus
δ(σ − ετ ) where ε ∈ R and τ ∈ Γ(EM [1]) gives a one parameter family of weight w = −1
densities. Successively differentiating this k times with respect to ε and subsequently
setting ε to zero establishes that δ (k) (σ) = [g; δ (k) (σ)] is a weight w = −k−1 distributionvalued density. Moreover, the conformally invariant integral of a weight 1 − d density
fΣ = [gΣ ; f |Σ ] along Σ may be expressed in terms of any smooth extension f of this
density via

This relation reduces to Equation (2.24) upon expressing it in a choice of metric.
We will employ standard distributional identities (on R) for the Dirac delta δ(x) and

θ0 (x) = δ(x) ,
and

xδ(x) = 0 ,
n

xδ 0 (x) = −δ(x) ,

xδ (n) (x) := x d dxδ(x)
= −nδ (n−1) (x) , n ∈ Z>1 ,
n
where n ∈ Z>1 . These are valid when integrating against suitable test functions. In
particular we will need to consider the situation where the coordinate x is replaced by
a defining function σ. Again, this is discussed in detail in [GW16a, GW19], the key

18

Arias, Gover & Waldron

maneuvre is to assume that in a neighborhood of Σ, the bulk manifold M can be treated
as a product Σ × I where I is an open interval about 0 and the defining function σ pulls
back to a coordinate x on I. Thus, integrals over such neighborhoods can be handled
using Fubini’s theorem.
Remark 2.3. The distributional calculus is also well adapted hypersurface computations.
For example, when σ is a defining density for a hypersurface Σ, we have the operator
identity relating the Laplace–Robin and Robin operators
b σ = δ(σ)δΣ ,
δ(σ) L
R
valid acting on any density of weight w 6= 1 − d2 . At the critical weight we may use the
e σ of Equation (2.18) to write the identity
operator L
e σ = δ(σ)δΣ ,
δ(σ) L
R
because δ(σ)Γ(EM [w]) = δ(σ)ΓΣ (EM [w]).
One integral result will play a key role, namely that the Laplace–Robin operator is
formally self-adjoint [GW16a]. Hence, if M is a closed conformal manifold, f a weight
1 − d − w density and g a weight w density, then

The same conclusion holds if f or g have compact support. We will use the notation † for
the formal adjoint along M , which ignores boundary terms, so that the above equation
reads
Lσ = L†σ .
The boundary terms are given in [GW16b, Theorem 4.3].
3. Minimal Hypersurfaces for Singular Metrics
Here we begin with the data of a sequence of conformal hypersurface embeddings
Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c) ,

(3.1)

meaning that Λ is a hypersurface in Σ and in turn Σ is a hypersurface in M . Then,
given a choice of defining density σ for Σ and thus a metric g o that is singular along Σ,
we consider the problem of determining, at least asymptotically, an oriented hypersurface Ξ (with boundary) that meets Σ transversely with intersection Λ = ∂Ξ, and such
that Ξ is minimal with respect to g o . We will often refer to Λ as the anchoring hypersurface/submanifold. This situation is depicted below:

As discussed earlier, in the case that the singular metric g o is Poincaré–Einstein, this
problem has been studied by Graham and Witten [GrW99] (see also [GR17]) using a
different approach.
A minimal hypersurface Ξ is characterized by the vanishing of its mean curvature HΞg
with respect to the ambient metric g. Our treatment of minimal surfaces relies on
formulating this condition in terms of defining densities. This is achieved by the next
µ
proposition. In what follows we use the notation A ∼ B when smooth densities A, B
and µ obey A = B + µC for some smooth density C.
Proposition 3.1. Let µ and σ be defining densities for embedded hypersurfaces Ξ and Σ,
respectively, Then, away from Λ, the mean curvature of Ξ with respect to the metric
g o = g/σ 2 is given by

Comparing the above display with the definition of the bracket h·, ·i in Equation (2.14),
the S-curvature in Equation (2.1) and the Laplace–Robin operator in Equation (2.5),
gives the result claimed in the first two displays of the proposition.
To prove the second claim, we could rely on the fact that Equation (3.4) gives the
mean curvature for any defining function µ and only compute the homogeneity of the

Given a hypersurface Σ ,→ (M, c), we may always find a conformal unit defining

This implies that if a minimal hypersurface Ξ for a singular metric g o = g/σ 2 intersects
the zero locus Σ of σ = [g; σ], it does so at right angles.
In general the minimal surface condition (3.5) for a singular metric g o determined
by σ cannot be solved smoothly, so instead we solve this problem asymptotically, in the
following sense:
Problem 3.2. Let σ be a defining function for Σ = Z(σ) ,→ (M, c) and let Λ ,→ Σ be an
embedded hypersurface. Find a hypersurface Ξ such that
o

HΞg = σ k A|Ξ ,
where g o is the singular metric determined by σ, Λ = Ξ ∩ Σ, the density A is smooth,
and the order k ∈ Z>1 is as high as possible.
The key to solving this problem is the following lemma:
Lemma 3.3. Let k ∈ Z>1 and µ0 = µ + σ k+1 µk+1 , for any µk+1 ∈ Γ(EM [−k]). Then

Then we note that acting on a weight w = 0 density f , we have
Lµ0 f − Lµ f = (k + 1) σ k µk+1 Lσ f + O(σ k+1 ) .
This identity is easily established by examining the definition of the Laplace–Robin
operator in Equation (2.5). Thus, because σLµ log S µ is itself a weight w = 0 density,

The above lemma is the basis for an iterative solution to the minimal surface condition (3.5). First consider a defining density for a hypersurface that meets Σ transversely
along Λ. Working locally, it is straightforward to improve this to a defining function µ0
for a hypersurface Ξ0 such that Σ and Ξ0 intersect along Λ at right angles. Moreover,
without loss of generality, assume that µ0 is a conformal unit defining density, so that
S µ0 = 1 + O(µd0 ). Then

It is not difficult to verify that Lσ (µf ) ∼ O(σ) for any density f . Thus, dividing the
above display by S σ (as remarked earlier this is well defined, at least in some neighborhood of Σ) and then acting with Lσ , with the help of the sl(2) algebra (see Section 2.4)
we find

Moreover, the weight w = 1 − d density along
BΛ := B|Λ
is uniquely determined by the above data.
The quantity BΛ obstructs smooth solutions to the singular minimal hypersurface
problem and is therefore termed the minimal obstruction density. It is an invariant of
the conformal embedding data Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c) and the defining density σ. Then if σ
is determined, to sufficient order, in terms of these embeddings via a suitable problem
it follows that BΛ is determined in terms of the conformal embeddings. For example,
the singular Yamabe problem determines σ modulo terms of order σ d+1 , and so achieves
this. In the special case that (M, g o ) is Poincaré–Einstein, BΛ is an invariant of Λ ,→
(Σ, cΣ ). This is another hierarchy in the same vein as that discussed in the introduction.
Moreover, for Poincaré–Einstein structures, it is known that BΛ is the functional gradient
of the area anomaly for the minimal surface Ξ [GR17].
Remark 3.6. A useful tool for computations with Poincaré–Einstein structures is to
choose a canonical metric g ∈ c. Writing σ to denote the function in σ determined
by g, which may be taken to equal the arc length x for a suitable geodesic shooting
problem, one obtains the Graham–Lee normal form [GL91] for the singular metric
dx2 + h(x)
.
x2
The Poincaré–Einstein condition then gives that h(x) has an even expansion in x. This
facilitates a simple proof of vanishing theorems for anomalies and obstructions in appropriate dimension parities. For example, this implies the area anomaly and hence the
minimal obstruction density BΛ vanishes in this case when d is odd [GrW99, GR17].
Noting that the Laplace–Robin operator is odd under the interchange x ↔ −x, when
expressed in the Graham-Lee normal form, it is not difficult to check that Lemmas 3.3
and 3.4 also lead to an even expansion in x for the function µ corresponding to µ, and
in turn vanishing obstruction for d odd.

We will employ the term minimal defining density for densities µ obeying the minimal condition (3.9) given the data Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, g o ) where the singular metric g o is
determined by the unit defining density σ (given the conformal class). When we need
to emphasize the choice of σ, we will use the term σ-minimal. This condition restricts
the zero locus Z(µ) to be a hypersurface Ξ that solves Problem 3.2 to order k = d − 1.
We will term such a hypersurface an asymptotically minimal hypersurface. When µ is
also chosen to further obey the singular Yamabe condition S µ = 1 + O(µd ), we term µ
a minimal unit defining density. A minimal defining density may always be improved to
a minimal unit one (while keeping Ξ in the zero locus) with the same zero locus Ξ (see
Section 2.3 and [GW15, GW16b]).
Equation (3.9) implies that (generically) the failure of Hσ
µ to vanish along Σ is proportional to the minimal defining density µ; this leads to another invariant of the embedding
data Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c), which we record in the following lemma.
Lemma 3.7. Let the conformal data Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c) be given and let σ be a corresponding unit defining density for Σ. Moreover let µ be a σ-minimal unit defining density
for Ξ with ∂Ξ = Λ. Then

where m̂ is the unit conormal for the hypersurface embedding Λ ,→ Σ.
Proof. Together, the minimal unit and unit defining density definitions for µ and σ imply

Hσ
µ = hσ, µi + σµ

(3.10)

for some smooth, weight w = −1 density C and some weight −d density C 0 (coming from
the log term in Equation (3.3)). Uniqueness of CΛ = C|Λ is guaranteed by Theorem 3.5
and the uniqueness property of unit defining density solutions to the singular Yamabe
problem. In particular this determines µ uniquely to O(µd ), which suffices for uniqueness
of C|Λ .
Now let us denote µ = [g; µ], σ = [g; σ], m := dµ, n := dσ. From the minimal unit
and unit defining density definitions (see Equations (2.1), (2.14) and (3.3)) we then have
(3.11)

m2 + 2µρµ = 1 + O(µd ) ,

n2 + 2σρσ = 1 + O(σ d ) ,

and
m.n + µρσ + ρµ σ = µC + O(σµd−1 ) + O(σ d−1 ) .

Here C denotes C in the scale g. Differentiating the last display along the conormal m

have

There are various conformally invariant relations obeyed by extrinsic quantities associated to an asymptotically minimal hypersurface Ξ along its boundary Λ. The first of these
Λ
was discussed above, namely that unit conormals m̂ and n̂ of Ξ and Σ obey m̂.n̂ = 0.
Another example is given in the following Lemma:
Lemma 3.8. Let Ξ be an asymptotically minimal hypersurface determined by the sequence of embeddings (3.1) where n̂ is the unit conormal to Σ. Then the trace-free
second fundamental form of Ξ obeys
˚Ξ

Proof. This is a corollary of Equation (3.20) below, but a direct proof can also be given:
Without loss of generality we can take Ξ to be the zero locus of a minimal unit defining
density µ. This means that we can use Equations (3.11) and (3.12) of the previous proof.
So now we compute
na nb (∇a mb + ρµ gab ) = ∇n (m.n) − na mb ∇a nb + n2 ρµ .

Similarly ∇n µ|Λ = 0. This completes the proof.

Remark 3.9. When the singular metric g o = g/σ 2 is Poincaré–Einstein, the hypersurface Σ is necessarily umbilic [LeB82, Gov10], so the invariant C|Λ then vanishes. Also

The following Lemma explains the significance of the result in Equation (3.14), and in
particular demonstrates that along Λ, the mean curvatures of Ξ equals that of Λ when Ξ

We now turn to the problem of computing the minimal obstruction density. This
may be achieved using a variant the idea behind the recursion developed in [GW15] for
calculating the obstruction to smoothly solving the singular Yamabe problem. The key
is to compute d − 1 derivatives normal to Σ of the canonical extension Hσ
µ of the mean
curvature of the singular metric defined in Equation (3.2). When µ is chosen to solve
the singular Yamabe problem we may instead study hσ, µi (see Equation (3.10)). The
following result is underlies a recursion for that computation.
Lemma 3.11. Let σ = [g; σ] be a unit defining density, µ = [g; µ] be a σ-minimal unit
defining density, and suppose k ∈ {1, . . . , d − 1}. Then for a given g ∈ c and k > 1,

is a weight −2 boundary invariant for a conformally embedded surface Σ, which is new
to the best of our knowledge. A straightforward computation shows that under the

for a sample geometry; an example is given below.
Example 3.15. Let M = R3 with conformal class of metrics c containing the metric
ds2 = dx2 + (1 + αx)dr2 + (1 + βx)r2 dθ2 ,
where (x, r, θ) are cylindrical coordinates and α, β are constant parameters inserted to
deform the geometry away from Euclidean 3-space. Take Σ to be the plane x = 0

is an orientable hypersurface in M and Λ is a closed orientable hypersurface in Σ. The

to be minimal. This geometry is depicted below:

We now input the additional data of a defining density σ = [g; σ] for Σ which determines a metric g o on M \Σ that is singular along Σ. We assume σ is positive on the
side of Σ occupied by D. We wish to study the “volume” of D and the “area” of Ξ with
respect to this singular metric. These diverge so we must regulate them suitably.
To begin with, we introduce a unit defining density µ = [g; µ] for Ξ where
D = {p ∈ M | µ(p) 6 0 6 σ(p)} ,
and
Ξ = Z(µ) ∩ {p ∈ M | σ(p) > 0} .
Then we pick any true scale τ = [g; τ ] and define a regulating hypersurface
Σε = Z(σ/τ − ε) ,
where 1  ε ∈ R+ . Then the metric g o is non-singular in the region
Dε := {p ∈ M | µ(p) < 0 < τ (p)ε < σ(p)} .
The choice of τ determines the regulating hypersurface, hence we call it the regulator.
Of key interest are quantities that are independent of the choice of regulator.
The regulated volume Volε of D is defined as the volume of the region Dε with respect
to the singular metric g o . This is regulator-dependent and given by
ˆ

Volε =

It turns out to be advantageous to write this result in terms of Heaviside step functions
and an integral over the manifold M :

Conformal geometry of embedded manifolds

29

In what follows we will assume that ∂M = ∅ (alternatively one can multiply the measure
of integration by a smooth unit cut-off function that vanishes far from the region D).
This leads to no loss of generality for our purposes.
The regulated area of Ξ is computed by integrating the volume element of the pullback
of g o along the hypersurface Ξε := {p ∈ Ξ | σ(p) > ετ (p)} . This could be computed
(inefficiently) by recycling the renormalized volume computations of [GW16a] for the
conformal manifold (Ξ, cΞ ) where cΞ is the conformal class of metrics induced by c.
Instead it is propitious to also write the regulated area in terms of distributions; indeed
using Equation (2.25) and that µ is a unit defining density, we have

where R(ε) is smooth. The ε-independent term Volren defines the renormalized volume.
The poles in ε (which we denote Poles(Volε )) are called divergences and have coefficients
given by local (along Σ), but regulator-dependent, formulæ

Analogous results may be derived for the regulated area using the methods developed

The renormalized area Arearen is not determined by Equation (4.6) and thus is not forced
to be local along Σ. A main aim of this article is to compute holographic formulæ for
the area and volume anomalies A and V as well as the divergence coefficients ak , vk .
5. Distributional Calculus
In this section we develop the general calculus required for handling products of distributions involving multiple defining densities such as those appearing in (4.4), (4.5), (4.8)
and (4.9). Just as for single scale problems, main ingredients are the sl2 algebra involving
the Laplace–Robin operator described in Section 2.4, and formal self-adjointness of the
Laplace–Robin operator (2.26).
5.1. Multiscale calculus. In the previous section, we showed that the divergences and
anomalies we are interested in computing are written in terms of integrals of the form

This will allow us to discard boundary terms when integrating by parts because we
e = ∅ or that we are dealing with integrals where a

cut-off function has been inserted to ensure vanishing support there. ´Moreover, when σ
is a unit defining density, the first integral in Equation (5.2) becomes
e F , and when in
Σ
´
addition the density µ is unit defining, the second integral is Λ G. Hence F and G are
holographic formulæ in the sense discussed in the introduction.
We will mainly focus, partly because it is canonical and simplifying, on the case
that σ = [g; σ] is a unit defining density; the method to handle to general σ is described
in [GW16a]. Our main interest is in the case where Ξ is the zero locus of a minimal unit
defining density µ. In other words the singular metric g o has asymptotically constant
scalar curvature and Ξ is an asymptotically minimal surface:

Sc g = 1 + O(σ d ) ,

A key tool is the following (single scale) recursive identity for derivatives of delta
functions of unit defining densities (see [GW16a, Proposition 3.3])
(5.3)

(Lσ )k δ(σ) = (d − k − 1)(d − k − 2) · · · (d − 2)δ (k) (σ) ,

k ∈ {1, . . . , d − 1} .

Conformal geometry of embedded manifolds

31

Turning to the multiscale setting, our starting point is the following identity for
Laplace–Robin operators acting on the Heaviside function:
Lemma 5.1. Let µ and σ be arbitrary weight w = 1 densities, then
Lσ θ(µ) = −σS µ δ 0 (µ) + (d − 2)hσ, µi δ(µ) .
Proof. This is a simple application of the distributional identity dθ(x)/dx = δ(x) and
the definition (2.5) of the Laplace–Robin operator. Calling σ = [g; σ] and µ = [g; µ] one
has
Lσ θ(µ) = Lσ [g; θ(µ)] = [g; (d − 2)∇n θ(µ) − σ∆θ(µ)]
= [g; (d − 2)m.n δ(µ) − σ(m2 δ 0 (µ) + δ(µ)∆µ)] .
Here, as usual, we denoted n = dσ and m = dµ. To write the first term on the last line
of the above display in terms of hσ, µi, we would need to add − d1 (σ∆µ + µ∆σ + 2Jσµ)
to m.n (see Equation (2.14)). But µδ(µ) = 0 = µ2 δ 0 (µ), so this addition is canceled
d−2 0
2 0
2
by a term d−2
d δ(µ)σ∆µ = − d δ (µ)σµ∆µ + d δ (µ)σµ J. Writing the last term of the
0
0
above display as σδ (µ)µ∆µ, the coefficient of −σδ (µ) is m2 − d2 µ(∆µ + Jµ) which (see
Equation (2.1)) correctly produces the required S-curvature contribution.

The above lemma has the following corollary:
Corollary 5.2. Let σ be a weight w = 1 density, then
Lσ θ(σ) = (d − 1)S σ δ(σ) .
Exactly the same proof technique as used for the above lemma and corollary extends
to the Laplace–Robin operator acting on differentiated delta functions:
Lemma 5.3. Let µ and σ be arbitrary weight w = 1 densities. Then, if k ∈ Z>1 ,
Lµ δ (k−1) (σ) = −µS σ δ (k+1) (σ) + (d − 2k − 2)hσ, µi δ (k) (σ) .
Remark 5.4. The central result (5.3) is a corollary to the above lemma, since replacing µ
by σ and using σδ (k+1) (σ) = −(k + 1)δ (k) (σ) gives (for k ∈ Z>0 )
(5.4)

Lσ δ (k−1) (σ) = (d − k − 1) S σ δ (k) (σ) .

In the above, we have employed the notation δ (0) (σ) := δ(σ). Also, calling δ (−1) (σ) :=
θ(σ), Lemma 5.1 extends Lemma 5.3 to the case k = 0.
5.2. Multiple distributions. Lemmas 5.1 and 5.3 provide the basic identities required
to handle integrals of the type (5.1), which include distributions with codimension two
support that are built from distributions with support along hypersurfaces. The central relations we need to derive are Equations (5.9) and (5.17); these underlie the key
Proposition 5.18.
To begin with we observe that generically the product of a differentiated delta function
multiplied by a Heaviside function lies in the span of images of Laplace–Robin operators:
Proposition 5.5. Let σ be a unit defining density and µ a minimal unit defining density.

Combining this display with Lemma 5.1, Equation 5.4 and the Leibniz rule of Section 2.5
we find

Lσ θ(µ)δ (k−1) (σ) = (k − 1)δ 0 (µ)δ (k−2) (σ) + (d − k − 1)θ(µ)δ (k) (σ) ,
where the first term is absent when k = 1. Although the above display was computed
when k 6= d2 − 1, it is not difficult to choose a scale g ∈ c and verify that it holds for any
k ∈ {1, . . . , d − 2}.
Next we address the other term on the right hand side of the result. Because δ(µ)
has Yamabe weight in four dimensions, we first consider d 6= 4 and compute (again using
Equation (2.14) and taking k > 2)

In fact the last display holds for any integer k ∈ {2, . . . , d − 2} and for d = 4; this can
be checked by direct computation in a choice scale g ∈ c. Combining the above displays
completes the proof.

We will later need the following technical Lemma giving the algebra obeyed by L0µ
and σ along Ξ.
Lemma 5.8. Let f be a weight w − 1 6= 2 − d density, σ be a unit defining density and µ
a minimal unit defining density. Then along Ξ, the operator L0µ obeys
Ξ

(d + w − 3)L0µ (σf ) = (d + w − 2)σL0µ f + O(σ d−1 ) .
Ξ

Moreover, when w = 3 − d one has L0µ (σf ) = O(σ).
Proof. The simplest proof is based on a choice of scale g ∈ c where f = [g; f ]. In that
case, for all weights w (including w = 1 − d2 and w = 3 − d) we have that L0µ (σf ) along Ξ
is given by
(d + w − 2)(∇m + wρµ )(σf ) = (d + w − 2)(σ∇m f + m.nf + wρµ σf )
= (d + w − 2)σ(∇m + (w − 1)ρµ )f + O(σ d−1 ) .
In the above, we used that µ vanishes along Ξ, as well as the minimal condition (3.12).
It is not difficult to assemble the quoted results from this display.

For the particular case of the volume anomaly in three dimensions (see Section 8.1),
we shall also need the action of the operator L0 on the log of a true scale τ . Hence in
that case we extend Definition 5.8 to read
b µ log τ = Lµ log τ .
(5.10)
L0 log τ := (d − 2)L
µ

We now proceed to develop the analogous machinery needed for handling densities
integrated against the product distribution δ(µ)δ (k) (σ). Performing the δ(µ) integration
these give integrals along the hypersurface Ξ. Therefore, to deal with the operators that
appear in this case, we rely on the notion of tangentiality developed in Section 2.4, see
in particular Definition 2.1.
Definition 5.9. Let σ be a unit defining density and µ a minimal unit defining density.
The tangential Laplace–Robin operator for the hypersurface Ξ = Z(µ) is defined as
follows:
In the case where f is a weight w 6= 1 − d2 , 2 − d2 density,
LTσ : Γ(EM [w]) → Γ(EM [w − 1])

Laplace–Robin operator acting on log densities
LTσ : Γ(FM [1]) → Γ(EM [−1])
by
b σ log τ − (L
b µ hσ, µi) + σ L
b 2 log τ .
LTσ log τ := (d − 3) L
µ
In the case when d = 4, the tangential Laplace–Robin operator operator acting on log
densities
LTσ : Γ(FM [1]) → ΓΞ (EM [−1])
is defined as
b σ log τ − (L
b µ hσ, µi) + σ L
e µL
b µ log τ .
LTσ log τ := L
Remark 5.12. Observe that, just as in the case of Definition 5.9 for the tangential
Laplace–Robin operator acting on standard densities, the codomain of the map LTσ acting
b µ log τ
on log τ is forced to be differently defined in dimension four, since in this case L
d
has critical Yamabe weight w = 1 − 2 = −1 (see Remark 5.10).
The key property of the Laplace–Robin operator LTσ is that it is tangential along Ξ in
the sense of Definition 2.1 and the obvious variant for codomains ΓΞ (EM [w]) :
Lemma 5.13. Let σ be a unit defining density and µ a minimal unit defining density.
Then the operators LTσ of Definitions 5.9 and 5.11 are tangential along Ξ.
Proof. Tangentiality of the operator LTσ acting at weights w 6= 1 − d2 and 2 − d2 is proved
in [GW16b, Proposition 4.7] (see also [GLW15]). Hence only the two critical weights
remain. For the case w = 1 − d2 , consider f 0 to be an arbitrary weight w = − d2 density.
Then, the non-vanishing contributions to LTσ (µf 0 ) along Ξ are given by

0, as required from Definition 2.1. A completely analogous computation, now using a
density f 0 of weight w = 1 − d2 , proves tangentiality of LTσ at weight w = 2 − d2 . The
proof of tangentiality in the log-density case follows from the previous cases specialized
to weight w = 0, because if 0 < f ∈ C ∞ M and f |Σ = 1 we may write f = eµω where
ω ∈ Γ(EM [−1]) and use log(f τ ) = log τ + µω. This reduces the required computations
to the previous cases.

Because the operator LTσ is tangential, we may define an analog of the Laplace–Robin
operator along the hypersurface Ξ by the following holographic formula:
LσΞ : Γ(EΞ[w]) → Γ(EΞ[w − 1])
with
LσΞ fΞ = LTσ f

(5.14)

Ξ

,

where fΞ ∈ Γ(EΞ[w]) and f ∈ Γ(EM [w]) is any extension of fΞ to M . The operator LσΞ
underlies an sl(2) algebra analogous to that constructed for the Laplace–Robin operator
in Section 2.4. The key relation for this is given below:
Lemma 5.14. Let fΞ ∈ Γ(EΞ[w]). Then
LσΞ (σΞ fΞ ) − σΞ LσΞ fΞ = (d + 2w − 1)fΞ + O(σΞd−1 ) ,
where σΞ is the restriction of σ to Ξ.
Proof. There many ways to prove this result, an expedient method is to first establish
the result along the interior of Ξ because this allows us to calculate using the scale
determined by the singular metric g o for which (away from Σ) σ = [g o ; 1]. In particular,
in this scale, when w 6= 1 − d2 , 2 − d2 , using Equation (5.11) we find

at weights 1 − d2 , 2 − d2 of LTσ as defined by Equation (5.11) are removable. Indeed, it
is straightforward to use Equations (5.12) and (5.13) to establish that LTσ f along Ξ is
as stated above for these critical weights. In the g o scale, the above display also gives
the result for σLTσ f along Ξ. Moreover, to compute LTσ (σf ) we only need write out the
above display replacing w by w + 1 because σf ∈ Γ(EM [w + 1]). Hence for the difference

while along Ξ, the latter is O(σΞd−1 ). This establishes the quoted result on the interior
of Ξ. Since both the left and right hand sides of this result are smoothly defined along Ξ,
the above interior computation suffices to establish their equality along all of Ξ.

The tangential Laplace–Robin operator LTσ introduced in Definition 5.9 is built from
formally self adjoint Laplace–Robin operators; see Equation (2.26). When integrating
over manifolds without boundary (or integrands with no support there), we encounter
the formal adjoint (LTσ )† of the tangential operator LTσ . This is easily computed using
formal self-adjointness of the L–operator:

Remarkably, the product δ(µ)δ (k) (σ) can be expressed in terms of the formal adjoint
given in (5.15) acting on a product of delta functions with one fewer derivatives. This
result, given in the lemma below, may also be viewed as an generalization of the key
recursive relation (5.4) to products of distributions.
Proposition 5.15. Let σ be a unit defining density and µ a minimal unit defining
density. If d2 , d2 − 1 6= k ∈ {1, . . . , d − 3}, then

k = 1, the last term is absent. Equation (5.6) gives Lµ δ(µ)δ (k−1) (σ) = (d − 2k −

Notice that the right hand side integrated against a density-valued test function f is
independent of the extension of f off of the zero locus of µ. This explains why the
formal adjoint of a tangential operator must appear on the left hand side. Moreover, the
above display suggests an obvious extension to higher codimension problems where the
anchoring submanifold is the zero locus of a set of defining densities {µ1 , . . . , µ` } and
one deals with products of delta distributions δ(µ1 ) · · · δ(µ` ).
We now develop the integrated analog of Proposition 5.15 and extend this to include
critical weights.
Proposition 5.17. Let σ be a unit defining density and µ a minimal unit defining
density. Then if f is a weight w = k + 2 − d density with k ∈ {1, . . . , d − 3} and d > 4,

Case (i) w = 1 − d2 and thus k = d2 − 1: We begin by computing Lσ δ(µ)f using the
method of proof of Lemma 5.7. We pick a scale g ∈ c and find

− 2σδ 0 (µ)(∇m + [1 − d2 ]ρµ )f − σδ(µ)(∆g + [1 − d2 ]J)f .

simply by iterating the recursions given in Equations (5.9) and (5.17).

The following pair of theorems express the above expressions as integrals over Σ
with local holographic formulæ for integrands. These follow immediately from Proposition 5.18 by setting f = τ −k , where the regulator τ is an arbitrary true scale.

Remark 6.3. Note that the results stated in the two previous Theorems hold√upon performing delta integrations according to Equation (2.25); the measure factors S usually
incurred when integrating along submanifolds, with respect to their induced conformal
structures, are both one because the defining densities σ and µ are conformal unit and
minimal conformal unit, respectively.
6.2. Anomalies. We now study the critical log ε divergences appearing in the regulated
volume and area expansions. In particular, in this section we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.
In arbitrary dimensions, the volume and area anomalies are given, respectively, by the

see Section 4. In the volume case, the recursion (5.4) gives
Lσ δ (d−2) (σ) = 0 ,
and so cannot be used to handle δ (d−1) (σ). Instead one must introduce a log density
into the problem (see [GW16a] and [GW19]). This relies on the following proposition.
from [GW19, Proposition 4.4] specialized to assume that σ is a unit defining density and

Proposition 5.18. For the remaining terms involving Lσ,τ operators in Equations (6.1)

We are now ready to complete the proofs of our first two main results.

When d 6= 4, the very last term can also be treated using (5.6). When d = 4, however, the
density δ(σ) has critical weight and the integrated formula (5.7) is needed. This distinction between critical (d = 4) and non–critical (d 6= 4) weights fits with that for the tangential Laplace–Robin operator LTσ acting on log–densities as given in Definition 5.11. Indeed, by using this definition directly in Equation (6.4) and performing computations that
rely on formal self-adjointness of Lµ and the identity σδ (d−3) (σ) = −(d − 3)δ (d−4) (σ),
we obtain

Equation (6.5) is a nice analog of the key Lemma 3.8 of [GW16a].

results for the volume and area anomalies.


The regulated volume and area anomalies V and A do not depend on the choice of
regulator τ , even though their corresponding extrinsic Q and T curvature integrands do.
Remember that the choice of a true scale τ = [g; 1] is equivalent to a choice of metric g
in the conformal class c. (In what follows we sometimes abbreviate our notation for the
dependence of Q and T curvatures and related operators on the underlying data that

The above formulæ encode how extrinsic (and submanifold) Q and T curvatures transform when moving to a conformally related metric e−2f g. Necessarily the sum of the

because V does not depend on f . Similarly, the integral of the right hand side of the
third equation over Λ vanishes because A is also independent of f . The three operators
acting on f above are conformally invariant and canonically determined by the structure
Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c), and are therefore of independent interest. They are the subject of the
following section.

The first important property of these operators are that they are tangential (see Definition 2.1 and the text that follows there). This means that they give holographic
formulæ for operators along Σ or Λ. These tangentiality properties are stated in the
next proposition.
(k)

Proposition 7.1. The operator P Σ,→(M,c) is tangential along Σ = Z(σ), the operator U Λ,→Σ,→(M,c) is tangential with respect to Σ along Λ = Z(σ, µ), and the opera(k)

tor P Λ,→Σ,→(M,c) is tangential along Λ = Z(σ, µ).
(k)

Proof. Tangentiality of the operator P Σ,→(M,c) is a special case of a result proved in
[GW14, Theorem 4.1] using the sl(2) algebra in Equation (2.9) and its enveloping algebra
identities (2.10). The result there pertains to general tractor bundles and so applies to
conformal densities. The quantity I 2 in that article is the S-curvature, which equals
one to order O(σ d ) in the present context because σ is a unit defining density (see
Equation (2.4)). It is not difficult to verify (again using the sl(2) algebra) that the
S-curvature can be replaced by unity without destroying tangentiality so long as the
power k of the Laplace–Robin operator is in {1, . . . , d − 1}.
(k)
Tangentiality of the operator P Λ,→Σ,→(M,c) along Λ follows from a similar argument to
(k)

that for P Σ,→(M,c) . The codimension two submanifold Λ is the intersection of Ξ and Σ
so it suffices to check tangentiality to each of these hypersurfaces along Λ separately.
Tangentiality to Ξ is guaranteed because already the operator LTσ is tangential to Ξ.
Then Lemma 5.14 provides the analog of the sl(2) algebra used in the previous argument.
Only the proof of tangentiality of the operator U Λ,→Σ,→(M,c) to Σ along Λ remains.
For that we need to show that

In the above the subscript “ext” denotes an arbitrary smooth extension to the bulk
(k)
manifold M . The operators PΣ,→(M,c) are the extrinsically coupled, conformal Laplacian
powers introduced in [GW15] (in that work these operators are also generalized to act
not only on densities but also on general tractors, moreover the integer k can be extended
(k)
to include any positive even k). Also here we have defined the operators PΣ,→(M,c) with
an additional factor of (−1)k as compared to [GW14] in order simplify later expressions.
For the case when the interior conformal class of metrics includes a formal Poincaré–
Einstein metric (in the sense of [FG84, FG07]), it was proved in [GW14] that the operator
(k)
PΣ,→(M,c) reduces to the Laplacian powers of [GJMS92]. Those results were summarized
in Theorem 1.3.
(d−1)
The operator PΣ := PΣ,→(M,c) is of particular significance because it determines the
conformal transformation property of the QΣ,→(M,c) curvature. It naturally pairs with

48

Arias, Gover & Waldron

the operator UΛ,→Σ,→(M,c) because together they satisfy Theorem 1.4, whose proof we
are now ready to give.
Proof of Theorem 1.4. That UΛ,→Σ,→(M,c) is canonically determined by the stated embedding data, follows by uniqueness of the unit and minimal unit defining densities σ
and µ up to higher order terms in σ, which cannot contribute by virtue of the sl(2)
algebra of Equation (2.9) and its analog along Ξ in Lemma 5.14.
As explained at the end of Section 6.2, because the volume anomaly V is independent
of the choice of regulator τ , it follows from Theorem 1.1, upon replacing τ by ef τ where
f ∈ C ∞ M and the identity log(ef τ ) = f + log τ , that

The integral formula of the theorem now follows directly by using the definition of the
(PΣ,→(M,c) , UΛ,→Σ,→(M,c) )-pair given in Equation (7.1) (and text directly thereafter).
The first of the leading derivative terms can be deduced from a counting argument

e where m̂ is the outward unit normal to Λ. Since
for any smooth function f˜ on Σ
the smooth function f is arbitrary and PΣ,→(M,c) has leading derivative term (d −
2
 d−1
2)!! ∆Σ 2 , this implies that the operator UΛ,→Σ,→(M,c) has the leading derivative
term stated modulo terms that are total derivatives. To establish that the latter are of
lower transverse order, it suffices to write out the holographic formula for UΛ,→Σ,→(M,c)
in a flat limit. More precisely for M = Rd with its standard conformally flat structure,
take Σ to be a hyperplane. Moreover, since we are considering the leading derivative
terms, we take Λ to be a hyperplane in Σ. It is then easy to verify that the minimal
surface Ξ is the hyperplane in M intersecting Σ along Λ at right angles. We leave it to
the reader to compute UΛ,→Σ in this setting and complete the proof.

Remark 7.2. Observe that the operator UΛ,→Σ,→(M,c) is order d − 2 in derivatives ∇m̂
normal to Λ. Choosing (M, g o ) to be Poincaré–Einstein, Theorem 1.4 solves holographically the problem of finding a canonical, conformally invariant operator of this order
acting on functions, determined by the embedding Λ ,→ (Σ, cΣ ) when dim(Σ) is even.
We can also now give the proof of Theorem 1.5.
Proof of Theorem 1.5. A somewhat tedious direct computation in a choice of scale shows
that along Ξ, the operator LTσ differs only by terms involving multiplication by extrinsic
curvatures from the Laplace–Robin operator intrinsic to Ξ depending on the defining
density σ|Ξ . (Alternatively, this result is an immediate consequence of the fact that
the Laplace–Robin operator can be constructed from the Thomas D-operator of [Tho26,
BEG94] as well as the results for the Thomas D-operator along hypersurfaces given
(k)
in [GW16b, Section 4.2].) Canonical determinedness of PΛ,→Σ,→(M,c) and its leading
derivative behavior can then be proved following mutatis mutandis the proof method
of Theorem 1.3. The displayed integral formula follows via the reasoning given below

Conformal geometry of embedded manifolds

49

Equation (6.6). (This logic is also the same as that used to prove the analogous statement
with boundary in Theorem (1.4).)

8. Examples
We now give the proofs of Theorems 1.6 and 1.7, which give examples of our results
when the bulk M is a three- or four-manifold. The proofs are direct computations of the
holographic formulæ of Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 determining the divergences in the regulated
volume and area expansions, as well as Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 which give the extrinsic
(Q, T )-curvature pair. The critical extrinsic Laplacian powers and the corresponding
conformally invariant boundary operators are directly computed from Definition 7.1. In
general, Q and T curvatures yield integrated conformal invariants so involve a mixture
of terms that are either dependent or independent of the choice of g ∈ c (or equivalently
a true scale τ ). We will use a mixed bolded and unbolded notation to keep track of
these dependencies. We also suppress the full extrinsic embedding data dependence
appearing as subscripts on curvatures and operators. We organize these calculations by
dimensionality and start with dimension three where we encounter at most two powers
of the Laplace–Robin L· operator. We will conclude by computing four-dimensional
quantities that involve the action of no more than three L· operators.

Observe that this vanishes when the embedding of Σ is umbilic, and thus also when
the singular metric g o is (asymptotically) Poincaré–Einstein. Moreover, the above integrand is manifestly conformally invariant, and hence it is possible that the corresponding
extrinsic Laplacian power may vanish; indeed this is the case:
PΛ = 0 .
To see this, it is easy to verify using Definition 5.9 that LTσ f |Λ = 0 for f ∈ C ∞ M , and
hence that Theorem 1.5 gives a vanishing result for PΛ .

We want to write this expression in terms of the embedding sequence Λ ,→ Σ ,→ (M, c).
Recalling that Lemmas 3.8 and 3.10 imply that HΛ,→Σ = HΞ |Λ , so we only need deal
with the second term in the above (note that along Λ, the unit conormal m̂ is determined
by the embedding Λ ,→ Σ). For this we first note that the trace of the d = 4 Codazzi–

Here the integrands of the above result are manifestly conformally invariant because
the scale dependent terms in the T -curvature conspire to precisely cancel those in the
extrinsic Q-curvature. Notice that this anomaly vanishes when Σ is umbilic and in
particular when the bulk is Poincaré–Einstein.
8.2.3. (PΣ , UΛ ) pair. The extrinsic conformal Laplacian power was calculated in [GW16b]

Observe that although Σ has dimension three so that there is no intrinsic conformally
invariant Laplacian power at this weight [GJMS92], the above operator is Laplacian-like
with the trace-free second fundamental form appearing in place of the inverse metric.
We have used a bold notation for both gradient operators because the gradient of a
function and the divergence of a weight −3 vector are conformally invariant operations
in three dimensions. It follows from the above display and the divergence theorem that
