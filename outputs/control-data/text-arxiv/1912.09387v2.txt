We develop a comprehensive quantitative theory for magnetoelectricity in magnetically ordered
quasi-2D systems whereby in thermal equilibrium an electric field can induce a magnetization and a
magnetic field can induce an electric polarization. This effect requires that both space-inversion and
time-reversal symmetry are broken. Antiferromagnetic order plays a central role in this theory. We
define a NeÃÅel operator œÑ such that a nonzero expectation value hœÑ i signals collinear antiferromagnetic order, in the same way a magnetization signals ferromagnetic order. While a magnetization
is even under space inversion and odd under time reversal, the operator œÑ describes a toroidal
moment that is odd both under space inversion and under time reversal. Thus the magnetization
and the toroidal moment hœÑ i quantify complementary aspects of collinear magnetic order in solids.
Focusing on quasi-2D systems, itinerant-electron ferromagnetic order can be attributed to dipolar
equilibrium currents that give rise to a magnetization. In the same way, antiferromagnetic order
arises from quadrupolar equilibrium currents that generate the toroidal moment hœÑ i. In the magnetoelectric effect, the electric-field-induced magnetization can then be attributed to the electric
manipulation of the quadrupolar equilibrium currents. We develop a k ¬∑ p envelope-function theory
for the antiferromagnetic diamond structure that allows us to derive explicit expressions for the
NeÃÅel operator œÑ . Considering ferromagnetic zincblende structures and antiferromagnetic diamond
structures, we derive quantitative expressions for the magnetoelectric responses due to electric and
magnetic fields that reveal explicitly the inherent duality of these responses required by thermodynamics. Magnetoelectricity is found to be small in realistic calculations for quasi-2D electron
systems. The magnetoelectric response of quasi-2D hole systems turns out to be sizable, however,
with moderate electric fields being able to induce a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton per
charge carrier. Our theory provides a broad framework for the manipulation of magnetic order by
means of external fields.

INTRODUCTION

The technological viability of alternative spin-based
electronics prototypes [1‚Äì3] hinges on the ability to efficiently manipulate magnetizations using electric currents
or voltages. Various basic device architectures are currently being explored that could offer the crucially needed
electric magnetization control. One promising approach
utilizes antiferromagnetic materials [4, 5], while another
employs current-induced spin torques [6‚Äì9]. A third interesting avenue has been opened by harnessing the magnetoelectric effect [10‚Äì15] in multiferroic materials [16‚Äì
20] for switching the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnetic contact [21, 22]. Results obtained in our work
point to an appealing alternative possibility, whereby intrinsic magnetoelectric couplings in ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic quasi-twodimensional (quasi-2D) itinerant electron systems provide a nondissipative mechanism for electric control of magnetizations. We present a

these paradigmatic nanoelectronic structures that have
the potential to become blueprints for future spintronic
devices.
Ordinarily, when matter is exposed to an electric field
E, the field generates a polarization P, while a magnetic
field B generates a magnetization M. Counter to this
familiar behavior, magnetoelectric media also develop an
equilibrium magnetic response M to an electric stimulus
E, and an electric response P to a magnetic stimulus
B [10‚Äì15]. A systematic understanding of magnetoelectricity can be based on an expansion of the free-energy
density F as a function of the externally applied electric
field E and magnetic field B [11, 15],

Here and in the following, we have denoted by ‚àÇ/‚àÇa the
gradient vector (‚àÇax , ‚àÇay , ‚àÇaz ) of derivatives w.r.t. the
Cartesian components of a vector a ‚â° (ax , ay , az ). In
both Eqs. (2a) and (2b), the first line embodies conventional electromagnetism in the solid state [11], whereas
terms in the second line of these equations are ramifications of the magnetoelectric effect [11, 12]. The appearance of the same set of coefficients Œ±ij , Œ≤ijk , and
Œ≥ijk in these equations indicates a deep connection between the microscopic mechanisms causing a magnetically induced polarization and the microscopic mechanisms causing an electrically induced magnetization. As
shown in the present work, quasi-2D systems facilitate
the detailed discussion and thorough elucidation of the
underlying mechanisms for such dual magnetoelectric responses. They also present a promising platform for exploiting magnetoelectricity in device applications.
As the product of E and B is odd under space inversion and time reversal, a nonzero tensor Œ±ij is permitted only for systems with space-inversion symmetry and

time-reversal symmetry both broken [11]. Terms proportional to the tensors Œ≤ijk and Œ≥ijk embody higher-order
magnetoelectric effects [15, 29, 30]. Systems in which
only space-inversion (time-reversal) symmetry is broken
can have nonzero tensors Œ≤ijk (Œ≥ijk ), while Œ±ij = 0. As an
example for the latter in the context of the present work,
we show that paramagnetic quantum wells in zincblendestructure materials exhibit the higher-order magnetoelectric effect associated with the tensor Œ≤ijk .
The magnetoelectric effect has been studied experimentally for a range of materials including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and multiferroic systems [12, 15,
16, 31, 32]. Existing theoretical studies of the magnetoelectric effect have either focused on elucidating general
properties of the tensors Œ±ij , Œ≤ijk and Œ≥ijk based on symmetry [33‚Äì35] or developed first-principles methods for
their numerical calculation [36‚Äì41] and semiclassical approaches [42]. These works considered insulators where
magnetoelectric effects are well-defined as a bulk property. Typically, these works have also limited their scope
to investigating only one of the two dual magnetoelectric
responses. As a result, the microscopic basis for the intrinsic symmetry of electric and magnetic responses has
been rarely discussed [43]. In contrast, the conceptually transparent and practically important quantum-well
system considered in the present work provides a versatile, unified theoretical framework for describing magnetoelectricity in paramagnets, ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, covering both the electrically induced magnetization and the magnetically induced polarization and
demonstrating explicitly how these two effects are intrinsically related. Furthermore, the quasi-2D systems
studied here are unusual examples of metals exhibiting
magnetoelectricity in equilibrium, i.e., in the absence of

3
transport currents. Specifically, the in-plane magnetic
field generates an electric polarization perpendicular to
the 2D plane and a perpendicular electric field induces an
in-plane magnetization [44]. The reduced dimensionality
of the quantum-well systems guarantees that these manifestations of magnetoelectricity are well-defined and also
accessible experimentally. The magnetoelectric coupling
per volume is proportional to the width w of the quasi2D system, and in antiferromagnetic and halfmetallicferromagnetic quasi-2D systems, it is also proportional to
the sheet density Ns . Thus, unlike magnetoelectricity in
bulk materials, it is easily tunable in quasi-2D systems.
While the magnitude of magnetoelectric-tensor components are similar to the moderate values in the classic
magnetoelectric Cr2 O3 , the electric-field-induced magnetization per particle is comparable to the values found in
current record-breaking multiferroics. See the comparison of relevant magnitudes provided in Table I. The unusual situation where an electric field can generate a large
magnetization per particle in a system with small magnitude of magnetoelectric-tensor components arises because the magnetoelectric response in our metallic quasi2D systems is associated with the itinerant charge carriers whose density per unit cell is small.
Our realistic theoretical study focuses on the technologically important class of materials realizing variants of
the diamond structure; see Fig. 1. As discussed earlier,
magnetoelectricity only occurs in situations where both
space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry are broken.
Hence, the magnetoelectric effect is absent in paramagnetic materials having the inversion-symmetric [45] diamond structure [Fig. 1(a)]. In contrast, the zincblende
structure [Fig. 1(b)] breaks inversion symmetry. In addition, time-reversal symmetry is broken in magnetized
samples with ordered spin magnetic moments or with an
orbital magnetization due to dissipationless equilibrium
currents. Such a magnetization can be caused by a Zeeman coupling of the charge carriers to an applied magnetic field, or by a ferromagnetic exchange field [46, 47]
that is present in the material itself or induced by proximity to a ferromagnet. The origin of the magnetization is largely irrelevant for the microscopic mechanism
of magnetoelectricity so that we denote all these scenarios jointly as ferromagnetically ordered. We demonstrate
in this work the emergence of finite magnetoelectric couplings in ferromagnetically ordered quantum wells made
from materials having a zincblende structure. We find
that already in the absence of external fields, the interplay of broken space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry generates a collinear orbital antiferromagnetic order
of the charge carriers that renders these systems to be
actually ferrimagnetic. The magnetoelectric effect can
then be viewed as arising from the manipulation of the
equilibrium current distributions underlying the orbital
antiferromagnetic order. Specifically, an electric field affects these currents in a way reminiscent of the Lorentz
force such that the modified currents give rise to a magnetization component in addition to, and oriented at an

angle to the ferromagnetic order in the system. In contrast, an external magnetic field B applied perpendicularly to the ferromagnetic order can induce an electric
dipole moment via a mechanism resembling the Coulomb
force, where the scalar potential is replaced by the vector
potential for B. This mechanisms for magnetoelectricity
in quantum wells made from ferromagnetic zincblende
semiconductors differs fundamentally from the electricfield control of the spontaneous magnetization Ms in
these systems [48, 49].
Magnetoelectricity occurs most prominently in antiferromagnetically ordered materials, where an electrically
induced magnetization is not masked by an intrinsic magnetization in the system. Similar to ferromagnetic order,
antiferromagnetic order can have a spin component and
an orbital component, and we can have spontaneous antiferromagnetic order due to a staggered exchange field
in the material, but the order can also be induced in both
paramagnets and ferromagnets. Here we consider the antiferromagnetic diamond structure shown in Fig. 1(c). To
study the magnetoelectricity exhibited in quantum wells
made from such a material, we develop a k ¬∑ p envelopefunction theory for itinerant-electron diamond antiferromagnets, which is in itself an important result presented
in this work. On the basis of this theory, we are able to
define an operator œÑ in terms of itinerant-electron degrees
of freedom such that a nonzero expectation value hœÑ i signals collinear antiferromagnetic order in the same way
that a nonzero expectation value hœÉi of the charge carriers‚Äô spin operator œÉ signals ferromagnetic order of spins.
Applying our theoretical framework to antiferromagnetically ordered quantum wells placed into external magnetic and electric fields, we reveal them to exhibit magnetoelectric couplings remarkably similar to those found for
the ferromagnetically ordered zincblende quantum wells
described above. The magnetoelectric response of the
antiferromagnetic system can be related to the modification of the quadrupolar equilibrium-current distribution

4
associated with antiferromagnetic order by external electric and magnetic fields. This is in line with the fact
that the magnetoelectric tensor Œ±ij behaves under symmetry transformations like a magnetic quadrupole moment [50], i.e., both of these second-rank material tensors require broken space-inversion symmetry and broken
time-reversal symmetry and these tensors share the same
pattern of nonzero components, though microscopically
they are generally not simply related with each other.
Analytical results obtained from effective two-band
models of confined charge carriers elucidate the basic
physical phenomena associated with magnetoelectricity
in para-, ferro- and antiferromagnetic quantum wells. Accurate numerical calculations utilizing realistic 8 √ó 8 and
14√ó14 k¬∑p Hamiltonians establish a typically large, practically relevant magnitude of the electric-field-induced
magnetization in hole-doped quantum wells made from
zincblende ferromagnets or diamond-structure antiferromagnets. The ability to illustrate the full complementarity of magnetoelectric responses within the same microscopic theory distinguishes our approach from most
previous ones [14]. We show that our explicit results for
the magnetic responses provide an important benchmark
for general theories of magnetoelectricity [50‚Äì52]. Our
findings provide a platform for further systematic studies
aimed at manipulating charges, currents, and magnetic
order in solids.
The remainder of this Article is organized as follows. In
Sec. II, we define the relevant quantities of interest for our
study, establishing the relation between the thermodynamic definitions of polarization (2a) and magnetization
(2b) and the electromagnetic definitions of these quantities. We then proceed, in Sec. III, to calculate magnetoelectric responses of quasi-2D electron and hole systems
realized in zincblende heterostructures having a Zeeman
spin splitting due to an external magnetic field or due to
the coupling to ferromagnetic exchange fields. In Sec. IV,
we develop a general framework for the k ¬∑ p envelopefunction description of antiferromagnetic order. We use
this framework to perform a comprehensive analysis of
magnetoelectric phenomena in quantum wells made from
diamond-structure antiferromagnets. Section V is devoted to deriving an upper bound on the magnitude
of magnetoelectric-tensor components in quasi-2D systems [53]. We summarize our conclusions and provide
a brief outlook in Sec. VI. Appendix A reviews currentinduced magnetization, a phenomenon that shares some
apparent similarities with the magnetoelectric effect. Ancillary results are presented in Appendices B and C.

ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC RESPONSES
IN QUASI-2D SYSTEMS

We consider a quasi-2D system in the (x, y) plane with
open boundary conditions in the z direction in the presence of a perpendicular electric field Ez and an in-plane
magnetic field Bk = (Bx , By ) [44]. Throughout this

work, vectors like Bk that have only in-plane components will be indicated by a subscript ‚Äòk‚Äô, and their vanishing z component will be suppressed. Very generally,
the polarization and magnetization can be obtained from
the free-energy density F via the relations [11]
‚àÇF
,
‚àÇ Ez
‚àÇF
.
Mk = ‚àí
‚àÇBk
Pz = ‚àí

(3a)
(3b)

More accurately, the polarization and magnetization
only depend on the change of the free energy Œ¥F ‚â°
F (Ez , Bk ) ‚àí F (0, 0) due to the fields Ez and Bk .
To simplify the analysis, we assume that only the itinerant charge carriers in the quasi-2D system contribute to
the electric and magnetic response. We assume that the
confining potential V (z) of the quasi-2D system includes
the electrostatic potential due to compensating charges
and external gates that ensure overall charge neutrality
and that are assumed to be fixed in space. Also, we assume that the potential V (z) defining a quantum well for
the quasi-2D system is symmetric, i.e., V (‚àíz) = V (z).
We denote the Hamiltonian for the charge carriers by H.
The electric field Ez enters H via the additional potential eEz z, where e ‚â° |e| is the elementary charge. The
magnetic field Bk enters H via the vector potential A
that is related to the magnetic field via Bk = ‚àá √ó A,
with ‚àá denoting the gradient w.r.t. the position vector
r ‚â° (x, y, z). In addition, Bk may enter H via a Zeeman term (g/2)¬µB œÉ ¬∑ Bk , where g denotes the g factor,
¬µB ‚â° e~/(2m0 ) is the Bohr magneton, with m0 being the
mass of free electrons, and œÉ is a dimensionless spin operator [54]. The eigenstates of H associated with eigenvalues Enkk have the general form

Here n labels the quasi-2D subbands, and kk ‚â° (kx , ky )

where w is the width of the quantum well, and f (E)
denotes the Fermi distribution function. We will later
assume zero temperature so that f (E) becomes a step
function f (E) = Œò(EF ‚àí E), with the Fermi energy EF .
Using the expression (5) for the free-energy density,
the polarization becomes
Pz = Pze + Pzq ,

The first term Pze arises from the Ez -dependence of
the energies Enkk of occupied states. The second term
Pzq represents a quantum-kinetic [55] contribution to Pz
that accounts for changes in the equilibrium occupationnumber distribution arising from a change of Ez . Hence,
in the low-temperature limit, Pzq reflects Ez -induced
changes in the shape or topology of the Fermi surface.
Using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem and assuming
the only explicit Ez -dependence in the Hamiltonian H to
be the potential eEz z [56], we find

denotes the displacement of an electron in the state
Œ¶nkk (z). Thus the term Pze coincides with the electrostatic definition of polarization as the volume average of
microscopic electric dipole moments [57, 58]. In a quasi2D system with open boundary conditions in the z direction (and overall charge neutrality as assumed above),
the electrostatic polarization Pze is unambiguously defined independently of the origin of the coordinate system. It avoids the technical problems inherent in studies
of the bulk (3D) polarization [58]. The average displacement of the occupied states is

Mek = Mok + Sk ,

To obtain Eqs. (16a) and (16b), we used once again the
Hellmann-Feynman theorem. The first term Mok represents the in-plane orbital magnetization [57, 58]. In Eq.
(16a), the symbol vk ‚â° ‚àÇH/(‚àÇ~kk ) denotes the in-plane
component of the velocity operator, and

with {A, B} ‚â° 21 (AB + BA). The expression (16a) is
associated with the vector potential A = z Bk √ó zÃÇ that is
adopted throughout our work as the appropriate gauge
for quasi-2D systems. This is the reason why Eq. (16a)
differs from the conventional formula for the orbital magnetization [58] that is obtained for the symmetric gauge
[59] Asym ‚â° 21 B √ó r, see Appendix B. Similar to Pze ,
the magnetization Mok of a quasi-2D system avoids the
technical problems inherent in studies of the bulk (3D)
orbital magnetization [58]; it is unambiguously defined
independently of the origin of the coordinate system.
An orbital magnetization Mok is generally accompanied
by a nonvanishing in-plane current distribution

though in thermal equilibrium, the total current Jk =

dz jk (z) is always zero. These currents jk (z) are

6
nondissipative because they are not driven by an electric
field. (Throughout this work, we assume Ek = 0 for the
in-plane electric field.) Direct experimental observation
of the currents jk (z) seems impossible, as their nature
appears to preclude any ability to make contact to them.
However, their ramification in terms of the magnetization
Mok is detectable.
The second term Sk in Eq. (15) represents the spin
magnetization, given in Eq. (16b) in terms of the dimensionless spin polarization hœÉinkk of individual states. We
rewrite this as

A polarization Pze represents the dipole term (l = 1)
in a multipole expansion of a charge distribution œÅ(z)
[57]. Similarly, an orbital magnetization Mok represents
the dipole term (l = 1) in a multipole expansion of a
current distribution jk (z). Charge neutrality of a localized charge distribution œÅ(z) generally requires a vanishing monopole (l = 0) for the multipole expansion of
œÅ(z). Similarly, a localized current distribution jk (z)
requires a vanishing monopole for the multipole expansion of jk (z). An equilibrium current distribution jk (z)
that breaks time-reversal symmetry is permitted in ferromagnets and in antiferromagnets [60]. The finite magnetization in ferromagnets implies that the equilibrium
current distribution jk (z) includes a dipolar component
(l = 1), whereas the vanishing magnetization in antiferromagnets requires equilibrium currents to be (at least)
of quadrupolar type (l = 2).
For finite systems, the lowest nonvanishing multipole
in a multipole expansion is generally independent of the
origin of the coordinate system and in that sense welldefined, whereas higher multipoles depend on the choice
for the origin [57]. We therefore limit our discussion below to the lowest nonvanishing multipole. As mentioned
above, in infinite periodic crystals, even the lowest nonvanishing multipole moment requires a more careful treatment [58].
As integrals can be more easily and more reliably
calculated numerically than derivatives [61], it is more
straightforward to evaluate numerically the integrals
defining the electromagnetic parts Pze , Mok , and Sk of
the response functions. On the other hand, it is more

difficult to evaluate accurately the full response functions
Pz and Mk that require a numerical differentiation of the
free energy F as a function of the applied external fields
[62, 63]. A detailed account of these technical issues is beyond the scope of the present work. In the following, we
thus focus on Pze , Mok , and Sk alone. This is adequate for
scenarios where the quantum-kinetic parts Pzq and Mqk of
the response functions are less important, which we have
found to be generally the case for a strong confinement
V (z). Within the framework of the analytical perturbative calculations of the magnetoelectric effect discussed
below, the external fields Ez and Bk do not change the
occupation of individual states. Quantum-kinetic contributions Pzq and Mqk thus do not arise in the analytical
calculations.

The diamond crystal structure is shown in Fig. 1(a).
Space inversion is a good symmetry in diamond so that
electronic states are at least twofold degenerate throughout the Brillouin zone [45]. The diamond structure is
realized in group-IV semiconductors including C, Si, and
Ge. In a zincblende structure, the atomic sites in a diamond structure are alternatingly occupied by two different atoms such as Ga and As or In and Sb [Fig. 1(b)].
Thus spin degeneracy of the electronic states is lifted in
paramagnetic zincblende structures except for k = 0.
Spontaneous ferromagnetic order is realized in semiconductors with zincblende structure such as GaMnAs
[64] and InMnSb [65], where the ferromagnetic coupling
between local Mn moments is mediated by itinerant holes
[46, 47]. In ferromagnetic GaMnAs, the magnetization
resides mostly in the Mn-impurity spins (with magnetic
moment 5 ¬µB ) [46, 47]. We want to focus here on ferromagnetic InSb, where the effective spin magnetic moment
of holes ‚àº 2Œ∫¬µB (with Luttinger parameter Œ∫ = 15.6) is
more than an order of magnitude larger than in GaAs
(Œ∫ = 1.2), so that the magnetization density residing in
spin-polarized itinerant InSb holes can easily exceed the
magnetization density due to Mn spins (assuming hole
densities comparable to the densities of Mn acceptors,
although the hole densities can also be controlled independently by means of external gates). In the present
work, we thus focus on the itinerant carriers, assuming
for conceptual clarity that the spontaneous magnetization Ms is fixed [49]. The more complicated band structure of holes can only be satisfactorily approached in less
transparent numerical calculations. Therefore, we complement the calculations for holes with more transparent
calculations for electron systems.
For common semiconductors with a zincblende structure, such as GaAs, InAs, and InSb, the electronic states

7
in a quantum well can be described by a multiband
Hamiltonian [66]
H = Hk + V (z) + HD + HZ + eEz z

.

(21)

Here Hk is the inversion-symmetric part of H, and HD
subsumes Dresselhaus terms due to bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA). V (z) is the quantum-well confinement, so
that the wave vector kk = (kx , ky ) is a good quantum
number, whereas kz becomes the operator ‚àíi‚àÇz . An external electric field Ez can be included in H by adding the
potential eEz z. Similarly, an external in-plane magnetic
field Bk can be included in H via the vector potential
A = z Bk √ó zÃÇ. In Hk + HD we then replace k by the
kinetic wave vector k = k + ~e A. The Zeeman term HZ
includes contributions from both the external field Bk
and possibly a ferromagnetic exchange interaction represented by an internal exchange field Xk that is likewise
assumed to be in-plane. A finite exchange field Xk corresponds to a finite spontaneous magnetization Ms in the
expansion (1). For X = 0, the system is a paramagnet,
where the lowest-order term in the expansion (1) that deB
pends only on B is ‚àí 21 ¬µ‚àí1
0 œáij Bi Bj , signifying the fact
that the system‚Äôs magnetization scales with the applied
field B until the system is fully spin-polarized. For the
magnetoelectric effect studied here, a finite Zeeman term
HZ indicates, first of all, a breaking of time-reversal symmetry so that the origin of HZ is largely irrelevant for the
microscopic mechanism yielding the magnetoelectric response. Nonetheless, as to be expected, we will see below
that only for X 6= 0 or a fully spin-polarized paramagnet, the final result for the lowest-order magnetoelectric
contribution to the free energy (1) can be expressed via a
tensor Œ±ij , whereas in partially spin-polarized paramagnets the linear dependence of HZ on Bk is the reason why
in lowest order we get terms in Eq. (1) that are weighted
by a third-rank tensor Œ≤ijk .
The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian (21) yields
the eigenenergies Enkk with associated bound states
Œ¶nkk (z) ‚â° hz|nkk i, where n is the subband index. In
the numerical calculations presented below, we use for H
the 8 √ó 8 Kane model and the 14 √ó 14 extended Kane
model as defined in Table C.5 of Ref. [66]. Confine-

ment in the quasi-2D system is due to a finite potential well V (z) = V0 Œò(|z| ‚àí w/2) with barrier height V0 .
The numerical solution of H is based on a quadrature
method [67]. We evaluate k-space integrals such as Eq.
(8) by means of analytic quadratic Brillouin-zone integration [68].
Before presenting numerical results for multi-band
models, we illustrate the physical origin and ramifications of magnetoelectricity in zincblende-semiconductor
quantum wells by analytical calculations. Specifically, we
consider a 2 √ó 2 model for the Œì6 conduction band

where m denotes the effective mass, HD is the Dresselhaus

the preceding term, œÉ ‚â° (œÉx , œÉy , œÉz ) is the vector of Pauli
matrices, and HZ is the Zeeman term that depends on
the total field Z ‚â° (g/2) ¬µB Bk + Xk . Considering the
transparent 2 √ó 2 model H turns out to be useful because
it captures the important physical trends, even though it
does not include certain details [such as nonparabolicity
and corrections to the Dresselhaus spin splitting (22c)]
that are included in H and that would be required for
a quantitatively reliable account of specific experiments.
The relation between the simplified Hamiltonian H and
the more complete Hamiltonian H is discussed in more
detail, e.g., in Ref. [66].
From now on, the direction of Z is chosen as the spinquantization axis for convenience. We will be interested
in terms at most quadratic in kk and linear in Bk , where
the latter is justified for weak fields Bk , i.e., when the well

width w is smaller than the magnetic length ~/|eBk |.

Up to Eq. (33c), the steps are exact in the sense that
they do not assume a perturbative treatment of HM‚Üê E.
To obtain Eq. (33d), we exploited the fact that the eigenstates |ŒΩi of the unperturbed problem can be chosen such
that all matrix elements in Eq. (33) become real. For
the last line of Eq. (33), we assumed that the potential
V (z) is symmetric. The first term in Eq. (33e) yields
a vanishing contribution when summed over the equilibrium Fermi sea, as it is proportional to the system‚Äôs total
equilibrium current. Therefore, a nonzero magnetization
is due to the second term in Eq. (33e), which yields a
contribution independent of the wave vector kk . Summing over the Fermi sea and assuming a small density
Ns such that only the lowest subband ŒΩ = 0 is occupied,
we obtain for the magnetization (16a) [69]

ance between spin eigenstates induced by the Zeeman
term (26b) [see Eq. (114) below]. The orbital magnetization MZ is due to spin-orbit coupling. Just like SZ,
the orbital contribution is already present in inversionsymmetric diamond structures, i.e., it is a manifestation
of spin-orbit coupling beyond the Dresselhaus term (26c)
and beyond the simple 2 √ó 2 model studied in this section. Therefore, MZ is always present in the numerical
calculations based on H. An analytical model for MZ
based on H is discussed in Appendix C.
The numerical calculations presented in Fig. 3 also include higher-order contributions to the Ez -induced magnetization beyond the mechanism underlying the perturbative calculation yielding Eq. (34). Such contributions
arise, e.g., from the interplay of Rashba spin-orbit coupling with the in-plane Zeeman field [71]. The pattern
of the numerically calculated Ez -induced magnetization
including, e.g., the dependence on the orientation of the
Zeeman field Z, is dictated by symmetry so that the
more complete numerical calculations are in line with the
qualitative predictions of the analytical calculations.
It is illuminating to relate the magnetization (34) to
the equilibrium current distribution (18). Using œÜŒΩ (z) ‚â°

In thermal equilibrium, the first term in Eq. (39b) averages to zero in Eq. (18a). The remaining terms are
independent of kk so that, for Z 6= 0, they do not average to zero in Eq. (18a).
The matrix elements contributing to the second term
in Eq. (39b) are nonzero independently of an electric field
Ez (provided the product ŒΩ 0 ŒΩ is also even). For ŒΩ 0 = 2,
we get equilibrium currents proportional to œÜ0 (z)œÜ2 (z)
that give rise to a magnetic quadrupole Q [Eq. (55) below]. The quadrupolar currents are illustrated in numerical calculations for a quantum well with finite barriers
and using the more complete multiband Hamiltonian H,
see Figs. 4(a) and 4(c). The quadrupolar currents and the
magnetic quadrupole Q are indicative of orbital antiferromagnetic order that is induced parallel to the Zeeman

and confinement [the potential V (z)]. The quadrupolar
currents are odd both under spatial inversion and time
inversion, consistent with the general discussion of antiferromagnetic order in Sec. IV B below. The orbital
antiferromagnetic order can be quantified using the NeÃÅel
operator œÑ defined below [Eq. (73)]. The Hamiltonian

where we assumed, as before, that only the lowest subband ŒΩ = 0 is occupied. [Here qœÑ is a band-structure

such a scenario as ferrimagnetic order. This classification

The last term in Eq. (39b) (with ŒΩ 00 = 1) describes
Ez -induced dipolar currents that contribute to the magnetization [Fig. 4(c)]. For œïZ = nœÄ/2 (n integer), the
quadrupolar and dipolar currents flow (anti)parallel to
the field Z, consistent with Eq. (34). As to be expected,

R
the total current Jk = dz jk (z) always vanishes. The
fact that the coupling of the currents jk (z) to a perpendicular electric field Ez is dissipationless resembles the
Lorentz force. However, it needs to be emphasized that
the equilibrium currents jk (z) and their manipulation
via electric fields are pure quantum effects with no classical analogue.
The numerical calculations for a ferromagnetic quantum well based on the multiband Hamiltonian H and presented in Figs. 4(a) and 4(c) assume that the exchange
field Xk is oriented in x direction. In this case, the equilibrium currents jk (z) represented by Eq. (39b) are oriented likewise in x direction. These currents are complemented by equilibrium currents jy representing the
orbital magnetization MZ induced by the exchange field

sin(œïZ + œïB) = ¬±1 ‚â° Œ∂. This situation is realized
in ferromagnetic systems when Xk k xÃÇ ‚â° [100] and
Bk k yÃÇ ‚â° [010]. Here the magnetization scales linearly
with Bk [for (g/2)¬µB Bk  X]. In paramagnetic systems with X = 0 and Z = (g/2)¬µB Bk , we have Œ∂ = ¬±1
when Bk k [110]. In this case the polarization Pze depends quadratically on Bk , consistent with Eq. (2). Thus
the system exhibits a higher-order magnetoelectric effect
[29, 30] that is the nondissipative counterpart of the previously discussed magnetically induced electric polarization in a multi-quantum-well system [77‚Äì79]. Figure 3(c)
illustrates the polarization (46) for a ferromagnetic InSb
quantum well.
The mechanism for the B-induced polarization can
be understood as follows: the vector potential A of a
magnetic field Bk has previously been used as a tool
to manipulate the charge density œÅ(z) in quasi-2D systems such as semiconductor quantum wells. Ordinarily,
a field Bk makes the charge distribution œÅ(z) bilayerlike by pushing œÅ(z) towards the barriers, but œÅ(z) still
preserves the mirror symmetry of a symmetric quantum
well [73‚Äì76]. This effect stems from terms quadratic in
A that we have ignored in the above analytical model.
In a low-symmetry configuration [indicated here by the
presence of the Dresselhaus term HD given in Eq. (22c)],
odd powers of the vector potential A can change œÅ(z) in
a way that no longer preserves the mirror symmetry of
the confining potential V (z). This effect resembles the
Coulomb force, where the scalar potential is replaced by
the vector potential A. However, it needs to be emphasized that, similar to Landau diamagnetism, we have here

12
a pure quantum effect; it has no classical analogue. This
effect is orbital in nature; it does not require a spin degree of freedom. For example, it exists also in spinless
2D hole systems that have a purely orbital Dresselhaus
term.

Clearly, Œ±ij 6= 0 requires spontaneous ferromagnetic order due to a finite exchange field Xk or full spin polarization (i.e., half-metallicity), and the particular form
of the tensor Œ±ij with two nonzero entries Œ±zx and Œ±zy
is consistent with the magnetic point group symmetry
220 20 of a ferromagnetic symmetric quantum well on a
zincblende (001) surface. A tensor Œ±ij 6= 0 will generally
also facilitate higher-order terms of the type ‚àù Œ≥ijk in Eq.
(1). In contrast, Œ≤ijk 6= 0 occurs even in paramagnets,
which is consistent with basic symmetry considerations

[29, 30, 33‚Äì35] as zincblende structures allow for piezoelectricity.
The magnetoelectric contribution (49) to the free energy can also be expressed as [80]

The angular dependence of the magnetoelectric effect is
governed by the orientation of the vector œÑÃÉ , which in turn
is determined by the orientation of the Zeeman field Z.
In particular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the orientation of the vector Z in position space
and the vector k0 in reciprocal space; specifically the part
(z)
k0 of k0 proportional to œÉz that turned out to be relevant for the magnetoelectric effect in the above analysis.
(z)
This vector k0 is collinear with the vector œÑÃÉ . Figure 5(a)
shows the relation between the orientation of Z and the
orientation of œÑÃÉ . A similar pattern exists for the currentinduced spin magnetization (cf. Appendix A) in systems
with Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (22c) for the orientation of the induced spin polarization as a function of
the orientation of an in-plane electric field [66].
The vector Ez zÃÇ √ó Bk in Eq. (51a) is a toroidal vector, i.e., it is odd under both space inversion and time
reversal [82]. On the other hand, Eq. (51b) shows that
the vector œÑÃÉ transforms like a magnetic field, i.e., it is
even under space inversion and odd under time reversal.
The different transformational properties of the vectors
Ez zÃÇ √ó Bk and œÑÃÉ in Eq. (51a) reflect the broken spaceinversion symmetry in a zincblende structure.

The term Œ¥F ‚àù Ez Bk in Eq. (49) is generally complemented by a second magnetoelectric term ‚àù Ez Bk . This
is because the Hamiltonian H also includes a term
H EB = b eEz ¬µB (Bx œÉy + By œÉx ) ,

(52)

characterizing the bulk zincblende structure that underlies the quasi-2D systems studied here. The prefactor b
is given in Eq. (7.5) of Ref. [66] in terms of momentum
matrix elements and energy gaps appearing in the larger
Hamiltonian H, yielding b = ‚àí221 AÃä/eV for InSb and
‚àí1.36 AÃä/eV for GaAs. The term (52) produces a second

smaller than 1 for typical quantum-well widths w &
150 AÃä. Experimental signatures of an Ez Bk -type magnetoelectric coupling have recently been observed for charge
carriers in deformed donor bound states [83].

E.

Magnetic quadrupole moment

The magnetoelectric tensor Œ±ij behaves under symmetry transformations like a magnetic quadrupole moment
[50], i.e., both of these second-rank material tensors require broken space-inversion symmetry and broken timereversal symmetry and these tensors share the same pattern of nonzero components. Similar to the magnetization M = ‚àí‚àÇF/‚àÇB, the components of the magnetic

where Bk is assumed to be homogeneous.] For the quasi2D systems studied here, Qij is the sum of two contributions

Similar to the polarization Pz and magnetization Mk
discussed in Sec. II, the orbital quadrupole moment (63)
avoids the technical problems arising for these quantities
in bulk (3D) systems. The orbital quadrupole moment

in 3D systems has recently been discussed in Ref. [52].
We evaluate the matrix elements h{z 2 , vk (kk )}i similar
to Eq. (33). We get in first order perturbation theory

In the last step, we kept only terms linear in the Dresselhaus coefficient d. The first term in Eq. (64d) yields
a vanishing contribution when summed over the equilibrium Fermi sea, as it is proportional to the system‚Äôs total equilibrium current. Therefore, a nonzero quadrupole
moment is due to the second term in Eq. (64d), which
yields a contribution independent of the wave vector kk .
Consistent with the above discussion of equilibrium currents, we have h{z 2 , kz2 ‚àí hkz2 i}i = 0 for an infinitely deep
square well and h{z 2 , kz2 ‚àí hkz2 i}i = ‚àíŒΩ ‚àí 21 for the ŒΩth
subband in a harmonic-oscillator potential. Summing
over the Fermi sea and assuming a small density Ns such
that only the lowest subband ŒΩ = 0 is occupied, we obtain

with Q0 = ‚àí¬µB Ns . The quadrupole moment Qozk shows
the same dependence on the orientation of the Zeeman
field Z as the magnetization Mok [Eq. (34)], where Z may
be due to an exchange field Xk or due to an external field
Bk . On the other hand, the vector Qozk shows a different
dependence on the orientation of Z than is exhibited
by the expectation value (41) of the NeÃÅel operator œÑ .
This is similar to how a spin magnetization S and the
spin polarization hœÉi can show different dependences on
the orientation of an external magnetic field B when the
Zeeman coupling in the field B is characterized by a g
tensor. See Eq. (16b) and Ref. [85].
Alternatively, we can obtain the result (65) by evaluating the free energy F in the presence of the vector
potential A for the field gradient bk . To first order in bk
and the Dresselhaus coefficient d, we get an energy shift
of the occupied states given by the expectation value of

where œï b is the angle between the direction of the field

the first term ‚àù A drops out. We get

quadrupole, similar to how the angular dependence of
the magnetoelectric effect is governed by the orientation

The contribution (67) to the free energy can also be

It has recently been suggested [51, 52, 86] that the components Qij of the magnetic quadrupole moment are connected with the components Œ±ij of the magnetoelectric
tensor via the relation e ‚àÇQij /‚àÇ¬µ = ‚àíŒ±ij , where ¬µ is the
chemical potential. For the metallic quasi-2D systems
studied here, this relation is fulfilled neither for an infinitely deep square well, where Qij = 0 but Œ±ij 6= 0, nor
for a parabolic well, where Qij 6= 0 but Œ±ij = 0. The magnetic quadrupole moment is found to arise solely from the
energy change of the confined-charge-carrier states due
to the magnetic-field gradient bk obtained by first-order

perturbation theory [Eq. (67)]; it has none of the additional contributions derived for bulk systems [86]. On
the other hand, the magnetoelectric tensor Œ±ij requires
second-order perturbation theory for two perturbations
E and B, see, e.g., Eq. (47) and Ref. [50]. These results
suggest that Qij and Œ±ij should generally be viewed as
independent coefficients in a Taylor expansion of the free
energy F as a function of the external fields E and B.

Magnetoelectricity in ferromagnetic hole
systems

The magnetoelectric response obtained in the realistic
calculations for electron systems in ferromagnetic InSb
quantum wells is small [Figs. 3(a) and 3(c)]. The response can be greatly enhanced by a suitable engineering
of the band structure Enkk of the quasi-2D systems. Here
quasi-2D hole systems have long been known as a versatile playground for bandstructure engineering, where
the dispersion of the first heavy-hole (HH) subband is
strongly affected by the coupling to the first light-hole
(LH) subband [66, 87, 88]. Figures 6(a) and 6(d) illustrate this for quasi-2D hole systems in paramagnetic InSb
quantum wells with width w = 150 AÃä [Fig. 6(a)] and
w = 300 AÃä [Fig. 6(d)], where HH-LH coupling results
in a highly nonparabolic dispersion E0kk of the doubly
degenerate ground HH subband. Furthermore, the dispersion is also highly anisotropic, which reflects the cubic
symmetry of the underlying crystal structure.
An important aspect for the magnetoelectric response is the breaking of time-reversal symmetry so that
En,‚àíkk 6= Enkk . The interplay between a ferromagnetic
exchange field Xk and HH-LH coupling can result in a
highly asymmetric band structure of quasi-2D HH systems with multiple disconnected parts of the Fermi surface, as illustrated in Figs. 6(b) and 6(e) for ferromagnetic InSb quantum wells [65]. Figures 7(a) and 7(c)
exemplify the Ez -induced orbital magnetic moment per
particle, which can rise as high as ‚àº 1 ¬µB for moderate
electric fields Ez . Figures 8(a), 8(c), 8(e), and 8(g) show
the equilibrium currents. Finally, Figs. 9(a) and 9(c)
show the Bk -induced displacement hzi that represents
the electrostatic polarization via Eq. (12).
The large magnetoelectric response of quasi-2D hole
systems can be ascribed to the strong asymmetry
En,‚àíkk 6= Enkk of the band structure. With increasing fields, the disconnected parts of the Fermi sea that
are located away from kk = 0 get depopulated and eventually disappear. The field-induced response drops again
when finally only the central part of the Fermi sea around
kk = 0 accommodates all charge carriers. Thus, unlike
the electron case discussed above, the hole systems show
a strongly nonlinear dependence of the magnetoelectric
response as a function of the applied fields.

MAGNETOELECTRICITY IN DIAMOND
ANTIFERROMAGNETS

Space-inversion symmetry of a diamond structure is
broken in the zincblende structure [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)].
Opposite magnetic moments placed alternatingly on the
atomic sites of a diamond structure result in an antiferromagnetic structure [Fig. 1(c)]. Both time reversal Œò and
space inversion I are broken symmetries in such a diamond antiferromagnet. The joint operation ŒòI, however,
remains a good symmetry so that, similar to paramag-

netic diamond, a two-fold spin degeneracy is preserved
throughout the Brillouin zone. Nonetheless, as these
symmetries are broken individually, invariants proportional to the NeÃÅel vector N appear in the Kane Hamiltonian that are forbidden in paramagnetic systems because
of time-reversal symmetry. These invariants are derived
in Sec. IV A.
The diamond structure is realized by the A atoms of
intermetallic cubic (C-15) Laves phases AB2 , and it has
been demonstrated that NpCo2 is an itinerant antiferromagnet, where the magnetic moments on the Np atoms
are ordered as shown in Fig. 1(c) (magnetic space group
I41 0 /a0 m0 d) [89, 90]. The diamond structure is also realized by the A atoms of spinels AB2 X4 . Frequently, spinels
with magnetic A atoms give rise to highly frustrated magnetic order [91]. Beyond that, a recent study combining experiment and theory [92] identified CoRh2 O4 as a
canonical diamond-structure antiferromagnet, where the
magnetic moments on the Co atoms are ordered as shown
in Fig. 1(c).

A.

The model

Our goal is to incorporate the effect of antiferromagnetic order into the k¬∑p envelope-function theory [66, 93]
underlying multiband Hamiltonians as in Eq. (21). To
this end, we start from the well-known sp3 tight-binding
model for diamond and zincblende structures with spinorbit coupling included [94, 95]. This model includes the
s-bonding valence band Œìv6 , the p-bonding valence bands
Œìv8 and Œìv7 , the s-antibonding conduction band Œìc6 , and
the p-antibonding conduction bands Œìc8 and Œìc7 . Except

quantum well (Ez = 7 kV/cm). In each panel, the dotted line
shows for comparison the charge distribution œÅ(z) (arbitrary
units).

for the low-lying valence band Œìv6 , these bands are also
the basis states for the 14 √ó 14 extended Kane model
[66, 96].
We add a staggered exchange field Y on the two sublattices of the diamond structure as depicted in Fig. 1(c).
Using the phase conventions for the basis functions of H
that are described in detail in Appendix C of Ref. [66],
the field Y yields terms in the off-diagonal blocks H8c 8v ,
H8c 7v , and H7c 7v of H that are listed in Table II using
the notation of Table C.5 in Ref. [66]. The vector N denotes the NeÃÅel unit vector with components Ni = Yi /Y.

The off-diagonal invariants H8c 8v , H8c 7v , and H7c 7v
appear already for k = 0. In the diagonal blocks H6c 6c ,
H8v 8v , and H7v 7v , a Taylor expansion of the tightbinding Hamiltonian about k = 0 yields mixed terms
proportional to powers of components of Y and powers
of components of k. The lowest-order invariants obtained
in this way are also listed in Table II. Alternatively, these
terms can be derived by means of quasi-degenerate perY
Y
turbation theory [66] applied to H with H8c 8v , H8c 7v ,
Y
and H7c 7v included. The latter approach yields explicit,
i
albeit lengthy, expressions for the prefactors d and Djj
as a function of Y = | Y| that are omitted here. As
to be expected for antiferromagnetic diamond, the Ydependent invariants in Table II break time-reversal symmetry, but they do not lift the spin degeneracy. Using
quasi-degenerate perturbation theory, we also obtain sevY
eral invariants in the valence band block H8v 8v that are
proportional to both Y and an external electric field E.
These invariants are listed in Table II as well. They describe a spin splitting proportional to the field E (but
independent of the wave vector k) that is induced by
the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. All invariants
listed in Table II can also be derived by means of the
theory of invariants [93] using the fact that the staggered
exchange field Y is a polar vector that is odd under time
reversal.
According to Table II, in lowest order the Œì6 conduction band in a diamond antiferromagnet is described by
the Hamiltonian

where d is a prefactor proportional to Y. Formally, HN
has the same structure as the Dresselhaus term (22c),
with the spin operators œÉi replaced by the numbers Ni
and d replaced by d. Therefore, the following study of
magnetoelectric coupling in antiferromagnetic diamond
proceeds in remarkable analogy to the study of magnetoelectric coupling in a paramagnetic or ferromagnetic
zincblende structure presented in Sec. III [81]. As HN
and, in fact, the entire Hamiltonian (69a), do not depend on the charge carriers‚Äô spin, the latter will be a
silent degree of freedom in the following considerations.
For the analytical model studied below, it is easy to
see that a purely in-plane NeÃÅel unit vector N yields
the largest magnetoelectric coupling. Assuming therefore that N is oriented in-plane, the full Hamiltonian
becomes [including terms up to second order in kk , compare Eq. (23)]

B.

The NeÃÅel operator

We now digress to discuss a few general properties
of the model for antiferromagnetic order proposed here.
It is well-known that the Zeeman term (22d) with an
exchange field X provides a simple mean-field model
for itinerant-electron ferromagnetism. Similarly, HN is
a phenomenological model for collinear (two-sublattice)
itinerant-electron antiferromagnetism.
The operator conjugate to the ferromagnetic exchange
field X is the (dimensionless) spin-polarization operator
œÉ = ‚àÇH/‚àÇX. In the mean-field theory underlying the
present work, a nonzero expectation value hœÉi indicates
ferromagnetic order of spins. Similarly, the operator conjugate to the staggered exchange field Y is the (again
dimensionless) NeÃÅel operator for the staggered magnetization,


œÑ =

‚àÇH
d 2 kx
=
k
‚àÇY
Y z ‚àíky



= qœÑ kz2



kx
‚àíky

where the prefactor qœÑ ‚â° d/Y depends on the momentum matrix elements and energy gaps characterizing the Hamiltonian H, but it is independent of the exchange field Y. A nonzero expectation value hœÑ i indicates collinear orbital (itinerant-electron) antiferromagnetic order. Like the staggered exchange field Y, the
NeÃÅel operator œÑ is a polar vector that is odd under time
reversal. Thus hœÑ i 6= 0 represents a (polar) toroidal moment [50, 82, 97]. On the other hand, X and hœÉi are
axial vectors that are odd under time reversal. In that
sense, hœÉi and hœÑ i quantify complementary aspects of
itinerant-electron collinear magnetic order in solids [60].
In systems with spin-orbit coupling such as the ones
studied here, the spin magnetization hSi associated with
the expectation value hœÉi is augmented by an orbitalmagnetization contribution, yielding the total magnetization M. A magnetization M arises due to the presence of an exchange field X or an external magnetic field
B, but it may also arise due to, e.g., an electric field E
(the magnetoelectric effect studied here) or a strain field
(piezomagnetism [11, 98, 99]). Similarly, a nonzero expectation value hœÑ i can be due to a staggered exchange
field Y. But it may also arise due to, e.g., the interplay
of an exchange field X, spin-orbit coupling, and confinement [Eq. (39b)].

C.

E-induced magnetization

To calculate the equilibrium magnetization, we start
from the Hamiltonian (70). Treating the electric field Ez
in first-order perturbation theory, the eigenstates become

compare Eq. (33). Again, we ignored any kk or k0 dependence of the perturbed states |ŒΩ (1) i, which is a higherorder effect. The first term in Eq. (76e) yields a vanishing
contribution when summed over the equilibrium Fermi
sea, as it is proportional to the system‚Äôs total equilibrium current. Therefore, a nonzero magnetization is due
to the second term in Eq. (76e), which is independent of
the wave vector kk . We can obtain Eq. (76e) from Eq.
(33e) by replacing œïZ with œïN and putting œÉ = 1 for
all states. The latter implies that the effect described by
Eq. (76e) is maximized compared with Eq. (33e) because
both spin orientations in the antiferromagnet contribute
constructively.
Summing over the Fermi sea, we obtain for the magnetization (16a)

electron density Ns = 1.0 √ó 1011 cm‚àí2 .

where the matrix elements Œ∫ŒΩ 0 ŒΩ are given by Eq. (40)
with œïZ replaced by œïN. Equation (80) is obtained from
Eq. (39b) by putting œÉ = +1 so that the interpretation
of Eq. (80) proceeds similarly. In thermal equilibrium,

the first term in Eq. (80) averages to zero in Eq. (18a).
The remaining terms are independent of kk so that they
do not average to zero in Eq. (18a). The second term
(ŒΩ 0 = 2) describes a quadrupolar equilibrium current
proportional to œÜ0 (z)œÜ2 (z) independent of the electric
field Ez . Such quadrupolar orbital currents are a generic
feature of antiferromagnets; they are the counterpart of
dipolar orbital currents representing the orbital magnetization in ferromagnets (see Appendix C) [100]. Similar
to Eq. (41), the orbital antiferromagnetic order can be
quantified using the NeÃÅel operator œÑ . The Hamiltonian
(70) (with Ez = 0) yields

ŒΩ0
As to be expected, we have hœÑ i k N.
The last term in Eq. (80) (ŒΩ 00 = 1) describes Ez induced dipolar currents, i.e., a magnetization. In
a quantum well of width w, the equilibrium currents
jk (z, ŒΩkk ) occur on a length scale of order w, which is
typically much larger than the lattice constant of the underlying crystal structure. The magnetic multipoles associated with the current distribution may thus be accessible experimentally. They may even open up new avenues
to manipulate the magnetic order in antiferromagnets.
Figures 4(b) and 4(d) illustrate the equilibrium currents
for antiferromagnetic InSb quantum wells.
It is illuminating to study a second mechanism for an
E-induced magnetization based on the antiferromagnetic
exchange term (69b) that manifests itself as a spin magnetization (16b). Generally, an electric field Ez applied
to a quantum well gives rise to a Rashba term [66, 101]

(82)

‚àö can be

aR Ez m/~2 . Performing the average (16b) over all occupied states in these spin subbands [assuming a dispersion

Inserting this result into (20) yields a spin magnetization that complements the orbital magnetization (77).
As to be expected, both terms have the same dependence on the direction of the vector N. The mechanism
described by Eq. (85) contributes to the numerically calculated magnetization presented in Fig. 3(b) [71].
We can interpret the spin polarization (85) as follows.
The Rashba term (82) yields a spin orientation (84) of
individual states |ŒΩkk ¬±i. Nonetheless, for nonmagnetic
systems in thermal equilibrium, the net spin polarization is zero because time-reversal symmetry implies that
we have equal probabilities for the occupation of timereversed states |ŒΩkk ¬±i and |ŒΩ, ‚àíkk ¬±i with opposite spin
orientations. This argument for nonmagnetic systems is
closely related to the fact that thermal equilibrium in a
time-reversal-symmetric system requires that the Fermi
sea is centered symmetrically about kÃÑ = 0. A nonzero

(1)

shift kÃÑ of the Fermi sea, and thus a nonzero average spin
polarization, are permitted in nonmagnetic systems as a
quasistationary nonequilibrium configuration in the presence of a driving electric field Ek , which is an important mechanism for the current-induced magnetization
reviewed in Appendix A. The spin polarization (85), on
the other hand, is entirely an equilibrium effect. It can
occur in antiferromagnetic systems, where time-reversal
symmetry is already broken in thermal equilibrium as
expressed by the shift kÃÑ = hk0 i.
It follows from Table II that we generally get a spin
splitting proportional to Ez even at kk = 0, which yields
a third, Zeeman-like contribution to the total magnetization (20). For quasi-2D hole systems, this effect can be
substantial. For quasi-2D electron systems, this effect is
of second order in the staggered exchange field Y.

D.

B-induced electric polarization

Our goal is to evaluate the polarization (8) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field Bk . The starting point
is again the Hamiltonian (70). An in-plane magnetic field
Bk represented via the vector potential A gives rise to
the perturbation [ignoring terms O(Bk2 )]

Thus similar to the ferromagnetic case [Eqs. (50)], antiferromagnetic order gives rise to Œ±ij 6= 0, and two nonzero
entries Œ±zx and Œ±zy are consistent with the magnetic
point group symmetry m0 mm of an antiferromagnetic
symmetric quantum well on a diamond (001) surface.
The antiferromagnetic order could also generate higherorder magnetoelectric contributions of the type ‚àù Œ≤ijk
and ‚àù Œ≥ijk in Eq. (1). However, unlike the paramagnetic
zincblende structure where Œ≤ijk 6= 0, the high symmetry of a paramagnetic diamond structure precludes the
existence of any magnetoelectric effects.

As was the case in the ferromagnetic configuration,
the magnetoelectric response obtained in the realistic calculations for electron systems in antiferromagnetic InSb
quantum wells is small [Figs. 3(b) and 3(d)]. However, as
before, antiferromagnetic hole systems show much larger
magnetoelectric effects. The physical origin of this enhancement can again be traced to the more pronounced
asymmetry En,‚àíkk 6= Enkk and nonparabolicity of quasi2D hole subbands. Figures 6(c) and 6(f) show the energy dispersion and energy contours for quasi-2D hole

22
density due to the electric field Ez and the magnetic field
Bk [53]. This will illustrate the versatility of the system
studied here. In generalization of Eq. (47) we consider

systems in antiferromagnetic InSb quantum wells with
width w = 150 AÃä [Fig. 6(c)] and w = 300 AÃä [Fig. 6(f)].
The Ez -induced orbital magnetic moment per particle
is plotted in Figs. 7(b) and 7(d). Figures 8(b), 8(d),
8(f), and 8(h) show the equilibrium currents. Finally,
Figs. 9(b) and 9(d) illustrate the Bk -induced polarization. Once again, the nonlinear dependence of the magnetoelectric response on the applied fields is due to the
depopulation of the disconnected parts of the Fermi sea
that are located away from kk = 0.

It is a unique feature of the quasi-2D systems studied

by Eq. (37) for the coefficient Œªd showing that the magnetoelectric coefficients Œ±zi likewise increase with increasing width of the quantum well. (The tensor œá gives the

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We present a detailed theoretical study of how magnetoelectricity arises in magnetically ordered quantum
wells with broken time-reversal symmetry and broken
space-inversion symmetry.
Quasi-2D systems based
on zincblende ferromagnets [Fig. 1(b)] and diamondstructure antiferromagnets [Fig. 1(c)] exhibit an analogous linear magnetoelectric response, i.e., an in-plane
magnetization induced by a perpendicular electric field
[Eqs. (34) and (77)], as well as a perpendicular electric
polarization arising from an in-plane magnetic field [Eqs.
(46) and (88)]. In realistic calculations, the magnitude
of the magnetoelectric response is small in quasi-2D electron system (Fig. 3), but it is sizable for quasi-2D hole
systems (Figs. 7 and 9). See Table I for a comparison of
benchmark values for our systems of interest with other
known magnetoelectric materials. While typical magnitudes of the magnetoelectric-tensor components are comparable to the those of Cr2 O3 , the maximum electricfield-induced magnetization per particle reaches the same
large order of magnitude (‚àº 1¬µB ) as demonstrated for the
giant magnetoelectric effect in FeRh/BTO. Our findings
suggest that bandstructure engineering and nanostructuring are fruitful avenues for generating and tailoring
magnetoelectricity in a host of materials.
Our study yields a new unified picture of magnetic order. Ferromagnetic order is characterized by a magneticmoment density M (a magnetization). In itinerantelectron systems, orbital ferromagnetic order is associated with dipolar equilibrium currents. On the other
hand, collinear orbital antiferromagnetic order is characterized by a toroidal-moment density hœÑ i for the NeÃÅel
operator œÑ that is associated with quadrupolar equilibrium currents. For the itinerant-electron systems stud-

ied in the present work, the equilibrium current distributions are slowly varying on the length scale of the lattice constant (Figs. 4 and 8). The magnetization M and
the toroidal-moment density hœÑ i quantify complementary
aspects of itinerant-electron collinear magnetic order in
solids. Ferrimagnetic systems are characterized by both
expectation values M and hœÑ i being finite simultaneously. Generally, the manipulation of itinerant-electron
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order via external
perturbations can be viewed as manipulating the underlying equilibrium current distribution (Figs. 4 and 8).
Ferromagnetic order M arises due to the presence of
an exchange field or an external magnetic field, but it
may also arise due to, e.g., an electric field (the magnetoelectric effect studied here) or a strain field (piezomagnetism [11, 98, 99]). Similarly, antiferromagnetic order
hœÑ i can be due to a staggered exchange field. But it
may also arise due to, e.g., the interplay of ferromagnetic order, spin-orbit coupling, and confinement [Eq.
(39b)]. The explicit form of the NeÃÅel operator œÑ and
how it can be manipulated depends on the symmetry
of the system under investigation. In the present work,
we used the envelope-function theory to derive explicit
expressions for œÑ in antiferromagnetic diamond structures. The theory for how M and hœÑ i are induced by
external perturbations can be phrased very generally using the theory of material tensors taking advantage of
crystal symmetry [93, 108‚Äì110]. In the magnetoelectric effect an I-odd Œò-even electric field E induces an
I-even Œò-odd magnetization M, which is permitted in
thermal equilibrium for magnetic media breaking both
space inversion symmetry I and time-reversal symmetry
Œò (Appendix A). Similarly, an electric field E can induce antiferromagnetic order represented via the I-odd
Œò-odd toroidal moment hœÑ i if the medium breaks timereversal symmetry Œò, while the medium may preserve
space-inversion symmetry I. Such a nondissipative antiferromagnetoelectric effect hœÑi i = Œ∂ij Ej is characterized
via an I-even Œò-odd second-rank tensor Œ∂ij . The constraints due to crystal symmetry for a nonzero tensor Œ∂ij
are fulfilled, e.g., by antiferromagnetic MnF2 (magnetic
point group 40 /mm0 m); this effect will be discussed in
more detail in a future publication. It expands recent
efforts geared towards an electric manipulation of anti-

25
ferromagnetic order [111‚Äì115].
Beyond that, the theoretical formalism and fundamental understanding of antiferromagnetic order presented in
this work can be applied to undertake more comprehensive studies of itinerant-electron antiferromagnets. Reliable modeling of antiferromagnetic-spintronics devices
[4, 5] requires the level of detail and realism provided by
our envelope-function theory. Basic questions concerning magnetization dynamics in metallic antiferromagnets
that are attracting current interest [116] can also be addressed.

ory of material tensors [93, 108‚Äì110] magnetoelectricity
is permitted for those magnetic crystal classes characterized by a magnetic point group G, where the polar
(I-odd), Œò-even vectors E and P and the axial (I-even),
Œò-odd vectors B and M transform according to the same
representation of G, i.e., Œ±ij must be an axial, Œò-odd
second-rank tensor. For each of the 58 groups G permitting an axial Œò-odd second-rank tensor [12], the patterns
of nonzero components Œ±ij allowed by symmetry have
been tabulated, e.g., in Ref. [110].
An at first glance closely related effect is a magnetization Mi induced by a spin-unpolarized electric-charge
current Jj , characterized by the relation [117‚Äì120]

Appendix A: Comparison of magnetoelectricity with
current-induced magnetization

It is the hallmark of the magnetoelectric effect that
an electric-field-induced magnetization and a magneticfield-induced polarization arise in thermal equilibrium,
and that these responses are duals of each other in that
they are characterized by the same magnetoelectric tensor Œ±ij , see Eqs. (1) and (2) [11]. The central requirement
for the occurrence of magnetoelectricity is that spaceinversion symmetry I and time-reversal symmetry Œò are
both broken; hence, magnetoelectricity is only possible in
certain magnetic systems. More precisely, using the the-

(A1)

where Œ∑ij is a second-rank tensor. The current J is a
polar vector, whereas the magnetization M is an axial vector (and both quantities are Œò-odd). Accordingly, a current-induced magnetization (A1) is permitted for those nonmagnetic crystal classes characterized
by a nonmagnetic point group G, where the polar vector J and the axial vector M transform according to the
same representation of G, i.e., Œ∑ij must be an axial (and
Œò-even) second-rank tensor. The 18 groups G that permit a nonzero axial tensor Œ∑ij are known as gyrotropic
point groups [121]. Current-induced magnetization (A1)
is forbidden for the nonmagnetic bulk zincblende structure [point group G = Td = 4ÃÑ3m, Fig. 1(b)], despite the
fact that inversion symmetry is broken in the zincblende
structure [122]. Current-induced magnetization in nonmagnetic media has been reviewed, e.g., in Refs. [123‚Äì
125].
The symmetry requirements permitting a currentinduced magnetization are fundamentally distinct from
those permitting magnetoelectricity. While magnetoelectricity is forbidden for nonmagnetic media, currentinduced magnetization is already allowed in nonmagnetic media. Extending the discussion to magnetic media, magnetoelectricity is allowed, e.g., for systems with
the bulk antiferromagnetic diamond structure [magnetic
point group G = 40 /m0 m0 m, Fig. 1(c)] [110]. At the
same time, the axial Œò-even second-rank tensor Œ∑ij describing current-induced magnetization must vanish for
systems with G = 40 /m0 m0 m. Contrasting that, a ferromagnetic bulk zincblende structure magnetized in z
direction (point group G = 4ÃÑm0 20 ) permits both magnetoelectricity and current-induced magnetization.
If the current Jj is induced by an external electric field
Ek via Ohm‚Äôs law Jj = œÉjk Ek (in studies of currentinduced magnetization, the conductivity tensor œÉjk is often treated within a simple Drude model [124, 125]), such
a dissipative current breaks time-reversal symmetry even
in nonmagnetic media, and we can rewrite Eq. (A1) as
0
Mi = Œ∑ij œÉjk Ek = Œ∑ik
Ek ,

(A2)

0
with Œ∑ik
‚â° Œ∑ij œÉjk , compare Eq. (2b). Accordingly,
the current-induced magnetization has sometimes been

26
called the kinetic magnetoelectric effect [120, 126],
though it is clear from the above discussion that the
physics expressed by Eq. (A2) is fundamentally distinct
from magnetoelectricity. In particular, Refs. [35, 126]
stressed the dissipative character of Eq. (A2), whereas
the actual magnetoelectric effect constitutes an equilibrium phenomenon. In contrast to the magnetoelectric
effect, Eq. (A2) has no dual whereby a magnetic field B
could induce a polarization P in a nonmagnetic medium.

where ijk denotes the totally antisymmetric tensor.
Thus
e
misym = ‚àí ijk {rj , vk } ,
(B4)
2
which is the conventional formula for the magnetization
[58, 59] consistent with classical electromagnetism [57].
On the other hand, we get for the asymmetric gauge A =
z Bk √ó zÃÇ employed in the present work
m = ‚àíe zÃÇ √ó {z, vk } ,

(B5)

whose components differ by a factor of 2 from corresponding terms with rj = z in Eq. (B4). Both expressions for
m are consistent with [57]
j = ‚àíe v = ‚àí‚àá √ó m .

(B6)

Similar to the definition (B1) of the magnetic-moment
operator, the operator of the electric dipole moment can

be defined as p = ‚àí‚àÇH/‚àÇ E. The electric field E can be
introduced into H via a scalar potential as in Eq. (29),
or via a time-dependent vector potential. Therefore, the
explicit form of the electric-dipole moment operator p is
also gauge-dependent.
Appendix C: Orbital magnetization induced by
Zeeman coupling

Very generally, even in the absence of an electric field
Ez , the Zeeman term induces a spin magnetization SZ
(anti)parallel to the Zeeman field Z and proportional to
the g factor, see Eq. (16b). However, in a more complete
multiband description, the g factor for an explicit Zeeman term may be greatly reduced or completely absent
[127]. In such an approach, we obtain instead an orbital
magnetization MZ due to equilibrium spin-polarized currents, for which spin-orbit coupling plays an essential
role. We demonstrate in the following that the spin magnetization SZ in a single-band model with g-factor g is
equal to the orbital magnetization MZ in the corresponding multiband model. While we focus for conceptual clarity on the simpler case of a magnetization due to Zeeman
coupling to a magnetic field, the arguments apply also to
a magnetization induced, e.g., by an electric field in the
magnetoelectric effect.
It is well-known [128] that the multiband description of
Bloch electrons is analogous to a fully relativistic description of electrons based on the Dirac equation. Accordingly, the observable predictions of multiband theories
embrace those of single-band theories similar to how the
observable predictions of fully relativistic theories based
on the Dirac equation embrace those of weakly relativistic theories based on the Pauli equation. The Pauli equation includes a Zeeman term with g-factor g that appears
as a prefactor for the spin magnetization (16b). On the
other hand, the Dirac equation does not contain a Zeeman term; but the interaction of the electrons with a
magnetic field is entirely accounted for via the minimal
coupling to the vector potential for the magnetic field
(i.e., we have g = 0 in the Dirac equation). Accordingly, SZ must vanish in a fully relativistic theory; and
the observable magnetization is entirely orbital even for
strongly localized magnetic moments on the atoms that
are commonly modeled as spin magnetic moments. This
is a direct consequence of the Dirac theory.
Working in a multiband theory, we demonstrate the
equivalence of SZ and MZ for the 8 √ó 8 Kane model
[66, 129, 130], where the orbital magnetization MZ is due
to the off-diagonal coupling between the conduction and
valence bands linear in k. The physics that is essential for
MZ is thus contained in the simplified Kane Hamiltonian

While g = 0 for the Hamiltonian HÃÉ, a spin magnetization SZ is obtained when HÃÉ is projected on the Œìc6

This calculation is similar to how the g-factor in the Zeeman term of the Pauli equation is derived from the Dirac
equation. An imbalance between spin-up and spin-down
states (due to an exchange field Xk or due to an external
field Bk ) thus implies a spin magnetization (16b) proportional to g.
For comparison, we now evaluate the orbital magnetization (16a) from HÃÉ without projecting on the subspace
Œìc6 . In the following discussion, ZÃÉ stands for an exchange
field X or a magnetic field B that enters HÃÉ via the vector potential A. Focusing on the states in the conduction
band and treating HÃÉ(1) in first order perturbation theory,

where we neglected contributions linear in kk as these
lead to higher-order corrections in Eq. (C6) below. In
the absence of a field ZÃÉ, the eigenstates (C3) are twofold
degenerate (œÉ = ¬±). The states (C3) are also the appropriate unperturbed states for first-order degenerate
perturbation theory for a field ZÃÉ oriented in z direction.

with g given in Eq. (C2). The matrix elements of the
orbital magnetization within the multiband Hamiltonian
HÃÉ are thus equal to the matrix elements of the spin magnetization in the two-band Hamiltonian H. In lowest order of ZÃÉ, these Hamiltonians yield the same imbalance
between the occupation numbers for the respective spin
states œÉ = ¬±. Thus it follows from Eq. (20b) that, averaged over all occupied states, the orbital magnetization
within HÃÉ equals the spin magnetization within H. In
both approaches, the magnetization vanishes in the limit

where we ignored the trivial kk -dependent part. Note
that, for a symmetric confinement V (z), the sum over ŒΩ 0
is restricted to terms such that the product ŒΩŒΩ 0 is odd.
For the lowest subband ŒΩ = 0, the dominant term in the
sum over ŒΩ 0 is ŒΩ 0 = 1. In itinerant-electron ferromagnets

with an intrinsic imbalance in the occupation of states
with opposite spins œÉ = ¬±, this term describes a dipolar
equilibrium current. In itinerant-electron antiferromagnets, the quadrupolar currents in Eq. (80) (with ŒΩ 0 = 2)
are the counterpart of dipolar currents (C7) (with ŒΩ 0 = 1)
in ferromagnets. These currents are illustrated in Fig. 4.

[44] These field configurations are associated with welldefined equilibrium-magnetoelectric effects for the
metallic quasi-2D systems considered in our work. Complementary magnetoelectric responses, e.g., an in-plane
electric polarization arising from the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, can occur in equilibrium only
for insulating 2D systems such as the idealized lattice
model discussed in Ref. [42].
[45] More precisely, the diamond structure is characterized
by a nonsymmorphic space group (Oh7 , # 227), i.e., the
inversion operation must be combined with a nonprimitive translation in order to map the diamond structure
onto itself. Nonetheless, the point group characterizing
the diamond structure is the point group of a cube, Oh ,
which includes inversion so that electronic states are at
least twofold degenerate throughout the Brillouin zone.

[49] In Mn-doped ferromagnetic semiconductors such as
GaMnAs and InMnSb, the magnetic order is mediated
by the holes in the valence band [47]. As a result, the
spontaneous magnetization Ms depends on the charge
distribution of holes in heterostructures made of these
materials and is therefore controllable by perpendicular
electric fields Ez [26, 48, 132]. The mechanism for this
type of magnetoelectric effect is fundamentally different
from the new type of magnetoelectricity focused on in
the present work. The latter effect can be cleanly accessed in experiments if the quantum well is equipped
with both a front and a back gate that can change the
electric field Ez at constant density [133, 134].

An exception to magnetic media permitting equilibrium
currents and a nonzero expectation value of the NeÃÅel operator œÑ are antiferromagnets with a type-IV Shubnikov
space group (i.e., crystals with a black and white Bravais
lattice). These systems do not break time-reversal symmetry in their point group [see M. Tinkham, Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics (McGraw-Hill, New York,
1964) and C. Herring, in Magnetism, Vol. 4, edited by
G. T. Rado and H. Suhl (Academic, New York, 1966),
pp. 298-344.]. In these antiferromagnets, a NeÃÅel vector N is equivalent to its inverse ‚àíN. Therefore, longwavelength equilibrium currents cannot exist. Likewise,
the expectation value of the NeÃÅel operator œÑ (which,
when nonzero, follows the orientation of N) must vanish in antiferromagnets with a type-IV Shubnikov space
group. In all of these systems, magnetoelectricity is forbidden by symmetry.

In the relation Z ‚â° (g/2) ¬µB Bk +Xk used in Eq. (22d),
we assume for the sake of consistency between the cases
with Bk 6= 0 and X 6= 0 that g > 0 so that in Eq.
(23) the eigenstates of œÉz with eigenvalue œÉ = ‚àí1 are
predominantly occupied for Z 6= 0. Indeed, for many
semiconductors including InSb and GaAs we have g < 0.
In such a case, when the Zeeman field Z is due to a
magnetic field Bk , we get an additional minus sign in
the final expressions for the magnetization [Eq. (34)],

the polarization [Eq. (46)] and the free energy [Eq. (49)].
[70] Taking values for d from Table 6.3 in Ref. [66], we find
ld = 200 AÃä for InSb, 7.24 AÃä for GaAs, and 7.13 AÃä for
InAs.
[71] The multiband Hamiltonians H used for the numerical calculations presented in Fig. 3 do not explicitly include a Rashba term. Nonetheless, as explained, e.g., in
Ref. [66], they account for Rashba spin-orbit coupling
to all orders in the wave vector k. In this case, similar to the discussion in Appendix C, Rashba spin-orbit
coupling manifests itself as a contribution to the orbital
magnetization presented in Fig. 3.
[72] Drawing conclusions about hole-doped systems such as
GaMnAs and InMnSb from our analytical considerations of quasi-2D electron systems is possible because
itinerant quasi-2D holes are shown in Sec. III F to exhibit qualitatively similar features as quasi-2D electrons.

‚àíœÑÃÉ 0 ¬∑ ( E √ó B) ‚àí qÃÉij

œÑÃÉ 0 = œÑÃÉ /2, qÃÉyz

0
unless the components of œÑÃÉ 0 and qÃÉij
turn out to be independent (which they are not in, e.g., our systems of
interest), they do not represent separate physical mechanisms for magnetoelectricity.
[81] The final results in the ferromagnetically ordered case
and the final results in the antiferromagnetically ordered
case differ by a minus sign that can be traced back to the
fact that the Zeeman term (22d) favors the occupation
of eigenstates with spin eigenvalue œÉ = ‚àí1.

[100] Ferromagnetic order also gives rise to higher multipoles
(l > 1) in the current distribution beyond dipolar currents (l = 1). Similarly, Eq. (80) also yields multipoles
l > 2. However, such higher multipoles generally depend
on the origin of the coordinate system [57].

[121] As certain aspects of gyrotropy require a symmetric material tensor, the discussion of gyrotropy is often restricted to those 15 crystal classes that permit a symmetric axial tensor of second rank [11, 108]. thus excluding the crystal classes C3v , C4v , and C6v . The currentinduced magnetization does not require that the corresponding material tensor Œ∑ij is symmetric. Therefore, it
can be observed for all 18 crystal classes that permit an
axial tensor of second rank.
[122] Among 21 crystallographic point groups lacking inversion symmetry, 18 point groups are gyrotropic. The noncentrosymmetric, nongyrotropic point groups include
Td , C3h , and D3h [123].
