Abstract. Strichartz estimates are derived from ℓ2 -decoupling for phase functions satisfying a curvature condition. Bilinear refinements without loss in the high frequency are discussed. Estimates are
established from uniform curvature generalizing Galilean invariance or from transversality in one dimension. The bilinear refinements are utilized to prove local well-posedness for generalized cubic nonlinear
Schrödinger equations.

1. Introduction
2

We point out how ℓ -decoupling implies Strichartz estimates for non-degenerate phase functions on
tori Tn = (R/2πZ)n . These estimates apply to solutions to linear dispersive equations

i∂t u + ϕ(∇/i)u = 0, (t, x) ∈ R × Tn ,
(1)
u(0)
= u0 ,

where ϕ ∈ C 2 (Rn , R).
The eigenvalues of D2 ϕ(ξ) are denoted by {γ1 (ξ), . . . , γn (ξ)} and we set
σϕ (ξ) = min({#neg.γi (ξ), #pos.γi (ξ)}).
The non-degeneracy hypothesis we assume reads as follows:
(E σϕ (ψ))

∃ψ : 2N0 → R>0 such that min(|γi (ξ)|) ∼ max(|γi (ξ)|) ∼ ψ(N ),

|ξ| ∈ [N, 2N )

and σϕ (ξ) is independent of ξ.
By PN we denote the frequency projector
(PN f )b(ξ) =

(

1[N,2N )(|ξ|)fˆ(ξ), N ∈ 2N0 ,
1[0,1) (|ξ|)fˆ(ξ), N = 0.

The Strichartz estimates we will prove read
(2)

kPN eitϕ(∇/i) u0 kLp (I×Tn ) . |I|1/p N s(ϕ) kPN u0 kL2 .

To prove (2), we will use ℓ2 -decoupling (cf. [2, 3]), more precisely, (variantsPof) the discrete L2 n
restriction theorem. This was carried out in [2, 3] in the special cases of ϕ(ξ) = i=1 αi ξi2 , αi ∈ R\0.
The modest generalization will clarify the role of the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues of D2 ϕ,
i.e., the curvature of the characteristic surface of (1).
The following proposition is proved:
Proposition 1.1. Suppose that ϕ satisfies (E k (ψ)) and let I ⊆ R be a compact interval. Then, we find
the following estimates to hold for any ε > 0:

Recall that certain Strichartz estimates from [1, 2, 3] are known to be sharp up to endpoints. With
the above proposition being a generalization, the Strichartz estimates proved above are also sharp in
this sense. We shall also consider the example ϕ(ξ) = |ξ|a , 1 < a < 2, where the proposition gives an
additional loss of derivatives due to decreased curvature compared to the Schrödinger case.

When we consider the associated nonlinear Schrödinger equation, we shall see why this additional loss
does probably not admit relaxation. Moreover, as in [2, 3] there are estimates for 2 ≤ p ≤ 2(n+2−k)
,
n−k
which follow from interpolation. In fact, as p 6= 2, Proposition 1.1 does not yield Strichartz estimates
without loss of derivatives.
When we aim to apply these estimates to prove well-posedness of generalized cubic nonlinear Schrödinger
equations

i∂t u + ϕ(∇/i)u = ±|u|2 u, (t, x) ∈ R × Tn ,
(4)
u(0)
= u0 ∈ H s (Tn ),
we will use orthogonality considerations to prove bilinear L2t,x -estimates for High × Low → Highinteraction without loss of derivatives in the high frequency. In [4, Theorem 3, p. 193] was proved the
following proposition to derive well-posedness to cubic Schrödinger equations on compact manifolds:
Proposition 1.2. Let u0 , v0 ∈ L2 (Tn ), K, N ∈ 2N . If there exists s0 > 0 such that
(5)

kPN e±itϕ(∇/i) u0 PK e±itϕ(∇/i) v0 kL2t,x (I×Tn ) . |I|1/2 min(N, K)s0 kPN u0 kL2 kPK v0 kL2 ,

where I ⊆ R is a compact time interval with |I| & 1, then the Cauchy problem (4) is locally well-posed
in H s for s > s0 .
Pn
For ϕ = i=1 αi ξ 2 , (5) follows from almost orthogonality and the Galilean transformation (cf. [1, 14]).
It turns out that it is enough to require (E σϕ (ψ)) to hold for some uniform constant:

(E σϕ (Cϕ ))

∃Cϕ > 0 : ∀ξ ∈ Rn :

min(|γi (ξ)|) ∼ max(|γi (ξ)|) ∼ Cϕ .

This will be sufficient to generalize the Galilean transformation and prove the following:
Proposition 1.3. Suppose that ϕ ∈ C 2 (Rn , R) satisfies (E k (Cϕ )). Then, there is s(n, k) such that we
find the estimate
(6)

kPN e±itϕ(∇/i) u0 PK e±itϕ(∇/i) v0 kL2t,x (I×Tn ) .Cϕ ,s K 2s |I|1/2 kPN u0 kL2 kPK v0 kL2

to hold for s > s(n, k), where I ⊆ R denotes a compact time interval, |I| & 1.
This bilinear improvement can also stem from transversality: In [10, 12, 13] short-time bilinear
Strichartz estimates were discussed and the following transversality condition played a crucial role in
the derivation of the estimates:
(Tα )

There is α > 0 so that |∇ϕ(ξ1 ) ± ∇ϕ(ξ2 )| ∼ N α whenever |ξ1 | ∼ K, |ξ2 | ∼ N,
K ≪ N, K, N ∈ 2N .

The corresponding short-time estimate reads
(7)

kPN e±itϕ(∇/i) u0 PK e±itϕ(∇/i) v0 kL2t,x ([0,N −α ],L2x (T)) .ϕ N −α/2 kPN u0 kL2 kPK v0 kL2 .

This is sufficient to derive an L2t,x -estimate for finite times by gluing together the short time intervals:
Proposition 1.4. Suppose that ϕ satisfies (Tα ) and let K ≪ N, K, N ∈ 2N . Then, we find the following
estimate to hold:
(8)

kPN e±itϕ(∇/i) u0 PK e±itϕ(∇/i) v0 kL2t,x (I×T) .ϕ |I|1/2 kPN u0 kL2 kPK v0 kL2 ,

whenever I ⊆ R is a compact time interval with |I| & N −α .

Invoking Proposition 1.2 together with Propositions 1.3 or 1.4, the below theorem follows:
Theorem 1.5. Suppose that ϕ ∈ C 2 (Rn , R) satisfies (E k (Cϕ )). Then, there is s0 (n, k) such that (4) is
locally well-posed for s > s0 (n, k).
Let n = 1 and suppose that ϕ satisfies (Tα ). Then, there is s0 = s0 (ϕ) such that (4) is locally well-posed
for s > s0 (ϕ).
Finally, we give examples: In one dimension we treat the fractional Schrödinger equation

i∂t u + Da u = ±|u|2 u, (t, x) ∈ R × T,
(9)
u(0)
= u0 ∈ H s (T),
where D = (−∆)1/2 .
Theorem 1.5 yields uniform local well-posedness for s > 2−a
4 , 1 < a < 2, which is presumably sharp up
to endpoints as discussed in [5], where the endpoint s = 2−a
4 was covered by resonance considerations.
For 0 < a < 1, Dinh [8] showed local well-posedness for s > 2−a
4 via Strichartz estimates for fractional
Schrödinger equations on compact manifolds. In [8] short-time arguments were used to derive Strichartz
estimates on arbitray compact manifolds. These estimates we can improve on tori for 1 < a < 2 because
we do not have to sum up frequency dependent time intervals. Since the derived estimates essentially
resemble the estimates on Euclidean space (cf. [11]), we conjecture the estimates to be sharp up to
endpoints.
We also discuss hyperbolic Schrödinger equations. The well-posedness result from [14, 9] is recovered
for the hyperbolic nonlinear Schrödinger equation in two dimensions, which is known to be sharp up to
endpoints. Generalizing the example, which probes sharpness in higher dimensions, indicates that there
is only a significant difference between hyperbolic and elliptic Schrödinger equations in low dimensions.
This note is structured as follows: In Section 2 we prove linear Strichartz estimates utilizing ℓ2 decoupling, in Section 3 we discuss bilinear Strichartz estimates without loss in the high frequency, and
in Section 4 the implied well-posedness results for generalized cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equations are
discussed.
2. Linear Strichartz Estimates

This expression is amenable to the discrete L2 -restriction theorem [2, Theorem 2.1, p. 354] or the

The phase function ϕ(ξ) = |ξ|a , 1 < a < 2 is elliptic and the lack of higher differentiability in the
origin is not an issue because low frequencies can always be treated with Bernstein’s inequality. ϕ satisfies

To find the L4t,x -estimate in one dimension, we interpolate the L6t,x -endpoint estimate with the trivial

L2t,x -estimate.

In case n = 1, 1 < a < 2, this recovers the Strichartz estimates from [7], and for 0 < a < 1, this
estimate was proved in [8]. For n ≥ 2, 1 < a < 2 this estimate seems to be new. Comparing with the
results in Euclidean space (cf. [11]), the estimates are presumably sharp up to endpoints.
3. Bilinear Strichartz estimates and transversality
The argument from Section 2 admits bilinearization provided that the dispersion relation satisfies
(E σϕ (Cϕ )). This generalizes Galilean invariance, which was previously used to infer a bilinear estimate
with no loss in the high frequency (cf. [1, 14]).

In one dimension (and for certain phase functions also in higher dimensions, see [13]) transversality
(Tα ) of the phase function allows us to derive Proposition 1.4, which improves the above estimate.
4. Local well-posedness of generalized cubic Schrödinger equation
Deploying Proposition 1.2 by use of the estimates from Section 2 and 3, we can conclude the proof of
Theorem 1.5:
Proof. First, suppose that ϕ satisfies (E σϕ (Cϕ )). In case K ≪ N , Proposition 1.3 yields the estimate

.ε,ϕ |I|1/2 K 2s(n,σϕ )+ε kPN u0 kL2 kPK v0 kL2 .

For K ∼ N , the claim follows after applying Hölder’s inequality and Proposition 1.1. From Proposition
1.2 we find (4) to be locally well-posed provided that s > 2s0 (n, σϕ ). In case ϕ satisfies (E 0 (ψ(N ))) and
(Tα ), we have the improved bilinear bound
kPN e±itϕ(∇/i) u0 PK e±itϕ(∇/i) v0 kL2t,x (I×T) .ϕ |I|1/2 kPN u0 kL2 kPK v0 kL2
due to Proposition 1.4. Hence, only loss stems from High × High → High-interaction, where K ∼ N :
By means of Proposition 1.1 and Hölder’s inequality, we derive
kPN e±itϕ(∇/i) u0 PK e±itϕ(∇/i) v0 kL2t,x (I×T) .ϕ K 2s |I|1/2 kPN u0 kL2 kPK v0 kL2

and by Proposition 1.2 we find (4) to be locally well-posed for s > 2s0 (ϕ).



We turn to examples: As discussed in Section 2, the phase functions ϕ(ξ) = |ξ|a (0 < a < 2, a 6= 1)
do not satisfy (E 0 (Cϕ )), but (Ta−1 ) for 1 < a < 2. For 0 < a < 1, K ≪ N , |I| & 1, we have the following
bilinear Strichartz estimate

kPN u0 kL2 kPK v0 kL2 ,

which can be proved like in [12, 13].
Consequently, by (the proof of) Theorem 1.5 we find (9) to be locally well-posed for s > 2−a
4 . As
discussed in [5], this is likely to be the threshold of uniform local well-posedness, which indicates that
the linear Strichartz estimates from Section 2 are in this case sharp up to endpoints.
In Euclidean space fractional Schrödinger equations were considered in [11]. Key ingredient to wellposedness are linear and bilinear Strichartz estimates, which hold globally in time due to dispersive
effects. On the circle we can reach the same regularity like in [11] up to the endpoint. Although
the linear Strichartz estimates might well be sharp in higher dimensions, satisfactory bilinear L2t,x Strichartz estimates appear to be beyond the methods of this paper so that we can not prove nontrivial well-posedness results in higher dimensions. Progress presumably requires an additional angular
decomposition (cp. [6]) to improve control of the resonance function.
For hyperbolic phase functions, Theorem 1.5 recovers the results from [14, 9], where essentially sharp
local well-posedness of

i∂t u + (∂x21 − ∂x22 )u = ±|u|2 u, (t, x) ∈ R × T2 ,

was proved for s > 1/2. Notably, due to subcriticality of the L4t,x -Strichartz estimate already for the
hyperbolic equations

i∂t u + (∂x21 − ∂x22 + ∂x23 )u = ±|u|2 u, (t, x) ∈ R × T3 ,

i∂t u + (∂x21 − ∂x22 + ∂x23 − ∂x24 )u

the (essentially sharp) Strichartz estimates yield the same well-posedness results as for the elliptic counterparts.
Firstly, recall the counterexample from [14], which showed C 3 -ill-posedness of (13) for s < 1/2. As
initial data consider

The same counterexample shows that s ≥ 1/2 is required for C 3 -well-posedness of (14). This regularity
is reached up to the endpoint by Theorem 1.5.
When considering (15), we modify the above example to
X
eik1 x1 e−ik1 x2 eik2 x3 e−ik2 x4 ,
φN (x) = N −1
|k1 |,|k2 |≤N

which again satisfies kφN kH s ∼ N s .

which implies C -ill-posedness unless s ≥ 1. This regularity is again obtained up to the endpoint by
Theorem 1.5.
Apparently, for other hyperbolic Schrödinger equations the L4t,x -Strichartz estimate also coincides with
the elliptic L4t,x -estimate and modifications of the above counterexample yield lower thresholds than in
the elliptic case. This indicates that the difference between elliptic and hyperbolic Schrödinger equations
is only significant for lower dimensions.
