The present article includes the enumeration of n-polygons with a certain symmetry
property: For an even number n of vertices, we count the n-polygons with n2 symmetry

Introduction
Definition of a n-polygon

n vertices are regularly distributed in a circle. We consider the Hamiltonian cycles through
the n vertices. [HP19] In this paper such Hamiltonian cycles are called n-polygons. The usual
polygons are the special case where all edges have minimal length.
Let n be a natural number n ≥ 3 and S 1 ⊂ R2 = C the unit circle in the Euclidean plane. The
finite subset
Vn := {vk := e2πik/n | k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1} ⊂ S 1
represents the vertices of an n-polygon.
To describe the n polygons we use the n-cycles σ = (σ1 , σ2 , · · · , σn ) consisting of the n numbers {0, 1, · · · , n − 1} in any order. The associated n-polygon P (σ) is given by the path
vσ1 vσ2 · · · vσn vσ1 or more precisely by combining the links vσi vσi+1 , i = 1, 2, · · · , n, where
σn+1 = σ1 .
Each of the n edges is assigned its “length” ei . ei = 1 means that the i-th edge runs counterclockwise from the vertex Vi to the following vertex Vi+1 . ei = 2 means that the i-th edge runs
counterclockwise from the vertex Vi to the vertex Vi+2 and so on. ei = n is not possible, since
this would mean the connection of the vertex Vi to itself. Therefore, only the numbers between
1 and n − 1 are allowed to describe the “length” of the edges. The “length” of an edge ei is
referred to briefly as a side of the n-polygon. Therefore, an n-polygon can also get described
by the n-cycle of its sides: (e1 , e2 , . . . , ei , . . . , en ).[Brü00]

Definition of the basic equivalence relations and general formulas

We denote by C(n) the set of all n-polygons and define the following equivalence relations on
C(n):
(1) Two n-polygons P1 (n) and P2 (n) are said to be similar, denoted P1 (n)
are obtainable from one another by a rotation or reflection.

answered by Golomb/Welch [GW60] and proved by Herman/Poimenidou [HP19] in a second
way. So it is known how many different shapes of n-polygons exist for a given n.

The question to deal with in this article

A closer look at the different shapes reveals that they have different and only certain symmetry
properties: E.g. for n = 6:
• One single shape with six axes,
• one shape with three axes,
• three different shapes with two axes,
• five different shapes with one axis,
• four different shapes without any axis.
In the latter case we observe that two shapes are completely asymmetrical, but they are similar.
Two other ones can be made to coincide to themselves by turning them 180 degrees around the
center of the circle. They are also similar.

Definition of a m-symmetric n-polygon
Let m > 0 be an integer. A m-symmetric n-polygon is a n-polygon with m axes, denoted by
Pm (n). |Pm (n)| denotes the number of their equivalence classes.
Question of the article
Let n = 2m be an even number. We ask for the number |Pm (n)| of equivalence classes of the
m-symmetric n-polygons.

Conclusion: n = 2k and the perfect numbers

Let n = 2k and m = 2k−1 with k ∈ N; k ≥ 3. The possible u-values are the odd numbers from
1 to n = 2k−1 − 1. From the main theorem follows immediately:

the form 2k−3 · 2k−2 − 1 for k > 4. Thus, we obtain, that the number |P2k−1 (2k )| is a perfect
number, if 2k−2 − 1 is a prime number.

Proofs

3.1

Lemmas

Before we begin with the proof of our main theorem, there are a few preparations:
Lemma 1 Let a, b and n be natural even numbers with a < b ≤ n − 1, i.e. a = 2f , b = 2g and
n = 2m with natural number f , g and m. If gcd(a + b, n) = 2 then
A) gcd(f + g, n) = 2 ⇔ f + g ≡ 0 mod 2 and g − f ≡ 0 mod 2
B) gcd(f + g, n) = 1 ⇔ f + g ≡ 1 mod 2 and g − f ≡ 1 mod 2
Proof of Lemma 1: (⇒)
A) If gcd(f + g, n) = 2, then f + g must be an even number. And also g − f must be an even
number.
B) If gcd(f + g, n) = 1, then f + g must be an odd number. And also g − f must be an odd
number.
(⇒)
Proof of Lemma 1: (⇐)
A) Let f + g be an even number. Then also g − f must be an even number. Because of the
requirements gcd(a + b, n) = 2 and a = 2f and b = 2g it follows, that f < a, g < b and
gcd(f + g, n) ≤ 2. Because in this case f + g is an even number gcd(f + g, n) = 2
B) Let f + g be an odd number. Then also g − f must be an odd number. Because of the
requirements gcd(a + b, n) = 2 and a = 2f and b = 2g it follows, that f < a, g < b and
gcd(f + g, n) ≤ 2. Because in this case f + g is an odd number gcd(f + g, n) = 1

Proof of the main theorem

Let n = 2m > 3 be an even integer.
2π
If a n-polygon with m axes Pm (n) gets rotated twice by the angle
, then it changes over into
n
2π
itself. A first rotation by the angle
changes Pm (n) with the sequence of sides
n
(e1 , e2 , . . . , ei , . . . , en−2 , en−1 , en ) into Pm (n) with the sequence (en , e1 , e2 , . . . , ei , . . . , en−2 , en−1 ).
2π
A second rotation of Pm (n) by the angle
changes the sequence (e1 , e2 , . . . , ei , . . . , en−2 , en−1 , en )
n
into the sequence (en−1 , en , e1 , e2 , . . . , ei , . . . , en−2 ), which represents the same polygon Pm (n).
After every second rotation we must get back our n-polygon with m axes.
With this we have proved the first theorem:
Theorem 1: Pm (n) is determined by two sides a ∈ N and b ∈ N with 1 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 1 and
the alternating sequence of its n sides (a, b, a, b, . . . , a, b).
a = b is excluded, because in this case the polynomial P (n) would have m = n symmetry axes
and would be either a common polygon or a regular star-polygon. The precondition n = 2m
would not be fulfilled.
Since the n-polygon Pm (n) = (a, b, a, b, . . . , a, b) and the n-polygon Pm (n) = (b, a, b, a, . . . , b, a)
belong to the same equivalence-class, we set a < b without affecting the generality, because it
is about to enumerate the number of the equivalence-classes. To each equivalence class belong
the two n-polygons Pm (n) = (a, b, a, b, . . . , a, b) and Pm (n) = (b, a, b, a, . . . , b, a).
The sums of the sides and the revolutions of the n-polygon P (n):
So that a n-polygon P (n) does not close prematurely, that is, before all n − 1 other vertices are
passed, no sums of 2, 3, . . . , n − 1 consecutive sides may be divisible by n, the sum sn of all n
sides on the other hand, it must be a multiple of n. So if sn = u · n, the natural number u is
the number of the revolutions in the circle made by the polygon P (n) during its construction.

Because sn = · (a + b), which is obvious, we get u =

The sums of the sides and the revolutions of the n-polygon with m axes Pm (n):
Let Pm (n) = (a, b, a, b, . . . , a, b) be our n-Polygon with m axes. We get the following sums of

Table 4: Sums of the sides of a n-polygon with m axes
With this we have proven the the basic Theorem 2: Existence-theorem:
Let a and b be two natural numbers with 1 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 1. Also, let be the sums of the
n-tuple (a, b, a, b, . . . , a, b) determined by the above terms for si for all i from 1 to n.
A equivalence-class of polygons Pm (n) is represented by a n-tuple (a, b, a, b, . . . , a, b) if and only
if all sums except the sum sn are incongruent 0 modulo n, but the sum sn is divisible by n.
Theorem 3: If a is even and b odd or b even and a odd, a and b do not induce a n-polygon
Pm (n).
Proof of Theorem 3: From the premise follows immediately that the sum a + b is odd and
a+b
= u a fractional number, which is forbidden since u indicates the number of
therefore
2
revolutions of the n-polygon Pm (n).

Thus, a and b must either be both even or both odd.
Theorem 4: If gcd(a + b, n) > 2, a and b do not induce a n-polygon Pm (n).
Proof of Theorem 4: Idea: We prove that under the premise of Lemma 3, among the sums
s2 to sn−2 with even index i, there is at least one sum that is divisible by n. This means that
the n-tuple of sides does not represent a n-polygon Pm (n) because the closure happens to early.
2n
then i ≤ 2n
3 < n. This
gcd(a + b, n)
a+b
index i is an even natural number, that is smaller than n. Set further v =
. v is a

The minimum value gcd(a + b, n) can take is 3. Set i =

Therefore it exists a sum with an index smaller than n, which is already divisible by n, if

Theorem 5: If a and b are even numbers and gcd(a + b, n) = 2, then a and b do not induce a
n-polygon Pm (n).
Proof of Theorem 5: Idea: We prove that among the sums s3 to sn−1 with odd indices, there
is at least one sum, which is divisible by n. This means that the n-tuple does not represent a
polygon Pm (n), because it would close too early.

Let v ≤ u =
be a natural number and a = 2f and b = 2g with natural numbers f and g

with f < g.
The equation si = v · n for odd i leads to the following linear diophantine equations (*) and

(*)
(**)

gcd(f + g, n) = gcd(f + g, −n) is the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of variables i
and v. Lemma 1 garantees that the constant g − f is divisible by this greatest common divisor. Thus, according to the well-known theorem on linear diophantine equations [Bas74], the
equation must be solvable with natural numbers i and v. It remains to show, that a solution
pair (i, v) exists such, that the odd number i obeys the inequality i ≤ n − 1 while v ≤ u.
For this we solve the equation (*) to i and estimate i upwards assuming that v ≤ u.

Theorem 6: If a and b are odd numbers and gcd(a + b, n) = 2, then a and b always induce a
n-polygon Pm (n).
Proof of Theorem 6: Idea: We prove for all odd indices, that the corresponding sums are
not divisible by n. We prove further for the even indices, that the corresponding sums are for
the first time divisible by n for i = n if gcd(a + b, n) = 2. If gcd(a + b, n) := d > 2, then an
index i < n is given, for which the corresponding sum is already divisible by n. The proof is
done separately for the odd and the even indices.

We combine now the theorems 1 to 6 into a theorem 7, which is already close to our maintheorem. For theorem 7, no further proof is required.
Theorem 7:
Let n = 2m > 3 be an even integer.
The n-tuples of sides (a, b, a, b, . . . , a, b) represent different equivalence classes of n-polygons
Pm (n), if and only if a and b have the following four properties:
1. a ∈ N with a ≡1 mod 2,
2. b ∈ N with b ≡1 mod 2,
3. 1 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 1,
4. gcd (a + b, n) = 2.

Main-theorem:
Let n = 2m > 3 be an even integer.
The n-tuples of sides (a, b, a, b, . . . , a, b) represent different equivalence classes of n-polygons
Pm (n), if and only if a and b have the following four properties:
1. a ∈ N with a ≡1 mod 2,
2. b ∈ N with b ≡1 mod 2,
3. 1 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 1,
4. gcd (u, m) = 1.

Proof of the formula for |Pm (n)|:
a+b
Let
:= u be prime to m. For each allowed u-value we determine all pairs (a, b), which
2
satisfy the first three properties in the main theorem. We have to distinguish two cases: either
u is even or u is odd. Finally, we determine the number of allowed pairs in both cases.
u is even:
The allowed a-values start with a1 = 1, the allowed b-values start with b1 = 2u − 1. We obtain
a strictly monotone sequence A of a-values and a strictly monotone decreasing sequence B of
b-values until b − a = 2, i.e.: A =< 1, 3, 5, . . . , aj > and B =< 2u − 1, 2u − 3, . . . , 2u − aj >.
The equation bj = 2u − aj = aj + 2 leads to aj = u − 1 and bj = u + 1. Therefore, the number
u
u
j of terms of both sequences equals to j = , i.e. there are j = allowed pairs (a, b) starting
2
2
with (1, 2u − 1) and ending with (u − 1, u + 1).
u is odd:
The allowed a-values start with a1 = 1, the allowed b-values start with b1 = 2u − 1. We obtain
a strictly monotone sequence A of a-values and a strictly monotone decreasing sequence B of
b-values until b − a = 4, i.e.: A =< 1, 3, 5, . . . , aj > and B =< 2u − 1, 2u − 3, . . . , 2u − aj >. A
further pair is not possible, because a 6= b is a condition.
The equation bj = 2u − aj = aj + 4 leads to aj = u − 2 and bj = u + 2. Therefore, the number
u−1
u−1
, i.e. there are j =
allowed pairs (a, b)
j of terms of both sequences equals to j =

starting with (1, 2u − 1) and ending with (u − 2, u + 2).
