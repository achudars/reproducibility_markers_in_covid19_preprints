ABSTRACT

Hematite as promising photoanode for solar water splitting suffers from severe bulk and surface
charge recombination. This work describes that a protonation-annealing treatment can effectively

1

suppress both bulk and surface charge recombination in hematite. Protons/electrons are
electrochemically incorporated into hematite under 0.2 VRHE followed by annealing at 120 oC. The
photocurrent density increases from ~0.9 mA cm-2 to 1.8 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under 1 sun, and
further to 2.7 mA cm-2 after loading cobalt phosphate, stabilizing at round 2.4 mA cm-2. A cathodic
shift of the onset potential of photocurrent is also observed. H2O2 oxidation, impedance
spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky measurements show that the protonation suppresses bulk
recombination and enhances donor density, but introducing more surface recombination. The
annealing reduces surface recombination, while preserving relatively high bulk charge separation
efficiency. Different from previous reports on the electrochemically reduced hematite, this work
demonstrates that the performance improvement should be ascribed to the proton incorporation
instead of the formation of Fe3O4 or metal Fe. This facile treatment by protonation and annealing
could be applied in other semiconductors to promote the development of high performing
photoelectrodes.

1. INTRODUCTION
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen is an attractive
approach for converting solar energy into chemical fuels.1-2 Photons absorbed by a semiconductor
create electron-hole pairs, which can be separated by the space charge layer of the semiconductor
to reduce/oxidize water into hydrogen and oxygen at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Hematite
(α-Fe2O3) has been intensively examined as photoanode for PEC water splitting3-12 due to its

2

theoretically high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (14−17%, corresponding to a
photocurrent density of 11−14 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under 100 mW cm-2 irridation).13-15 However,
the reported photocurrent densities for water splitting using hematite photoanodes are far below
the theoretical maximum value.4-5, 7, 16-19 Only the electron-hole pairs which are photo-generated
within the space charge layer or those can diffuse into this layer will be separated, while the rest
of the electron-hole pairs will recombine in the bulk.8, 13 Moreover, severe surface recombination
has also been reported due to the photo-induced high valent iron species at the surface.20-21
Various morphologies of hematite photoanodes on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate
have been reported including hydrothermally prepared nanorods,4-5,
colloids,3 chemical vapor deposited nanostructures,7,

22-25

10, 16-18

solution-based

spray pyrolyzed platelets23 and

deposition-annealing prepared nanoparticles.19 According to literature,4-5,

16-18

hydrothermally

prepared hematite nanorods need to be activated by a short time annealing at about 800 oC to
enable tin diffusion into hematite from FTO substrate for higher donor density and better interface
between hematite and FTO. Photocurrent densities4-5,

17-18

with a large dispersion have been

reported in the range of 0.6−1.3 mA cm-2 for hematite nanorod photoanodes at 1.23 VRHE, while
loading cocatalysts NiFeOx4 or FeOOH5 improves the photocurrent density to ~1.4 mA cm-2.
Doping with Zr16, Pt18 and P26 results in higher photocurrent density of ~1.5 mA cm-2, ~2.2 mA
cm-2 and ~2.7 mA cm-2, which can be further increased up to over 3 mA cm-2 after loading cobalt
phosphate (Co-Pi) cocatalyst. An extra passivation layer of SiOx27, TiO228 or Fe2TiO529 deposited
by atomic layer deposition also demonstrates significant improvement in the PEC performance of
hematite photoanode.
A negative polarization of metal oxide electrodes in aqueous electrolyte can simultaneously
introduce electrons and small cations such as H+ and Li+ in the bulk structure, which is termed

3

electrochemical doping.30-36 The incorporation of proton/e- was found to improve the electrode
efficiency for dye-sensitized solar cells32-33 and water splitting.30, 34-35 Proton functions as a shallow
donor in semiconductors and increases the donor density, thus improving the majority carrier
transport, as demonstrated for semiconductors with low donor densities like WO3,30 TiO2,32-33
ZnO,37 In2O3 and SnO2,38 etc. Moreover, another reason for the improved photocurrent has been
recently clarified that electrochemically incorporated protons readily segregates to the grain
boundary reducing 50% of the overall number of deep electron traps.31 The protonation through
electrochemical doping is usually long lasting and can only be reversed by extremely long time
positive polarization31 or heating at high temperature.30 On the other hand, a negative enough
polarization can also reduce hematite to more conductive phases such as Fe3O4 or even Fe to
enhance the performances.34, 39-40
This study aims at understanding the influence of electrochemical doping on the PEC
performance of hematite nanorods photoanode prepared by hydrothermal method.4-5,

16-18, 41

Protons are electrochemically introduced to hematite, followed by annealing treatments at an
optimized temperature of 120 oC. Indeed, the protonation and annealing processed hematite shows
a photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is higher than the values reported in
literature for hematite nanorods photoanode without cocatalysts.4-5,

16-17

After loading Co-Pi

cocatalyst, hematite exhibits a photocurrent density of 2.7 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE, which stabilizes
at around 2.4 mA cm-2 after 5 h test, comparable to the performances previously reported for
hematite with different morphologies such as Ti-doped hematite nanoparticles,19 IrO2-loaded
hematite cauliflowers.7 XPS, Raman and Mössbauer spectra excludes the presence of Fe2+ or Fe.
Thus we ascribe the photocurrent change to the incorporation of proton/e-, which is similar to the
Volmer reaction for hydrogen evolution reaction. We clarify that the protonation improves the

4

bulk charge separation efficiency but introduces more surface recombination, while the annealing
treatment suppresses the surface recombination, still preserving relatively high bulk charge
separation efficiency.
2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
2.1. Preparation of hematite photoanode. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates
(6~9 Ω sq-1, Xop Glass) were cleaned by deionized water, isopropanol and acetone. β-FeOOH
nanorods were grown on FTO in a solution containing 0.15 M FeCl3 (97%, Aldrich) and 1 M
NaNO3 (99.5%, Merck) with a pH 1.5 adjusted by HCl. The reaction was carried out at 100 oC for
6 h. Kapton tape was used to define the area for hematite growth and isolate the back side of the
glass from the growing solution. After removing Kapton tapes and cleaning with DI water, FeOOH
was annealed in air at 550 oC for 2 h and then activated by annealing at 800 oC for 10 min in a tube
furnace to enable the diffusion of Sn from fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate to hematite.4-5, 1618

2.2. Co-Pi deposition. The layer of Co-Pi on annealed hematite was loaded by photo-assisted
electrodepostion under AM 1.5 G illumination from an electrolyte containing 0.5 mM
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (98%, Alfa Aesar) in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7. A galvanostatic
deposition was applied for 100 s with a current density of 6 µA cm-2.
2.3. Photoelectrochemical characterization. All photoelectrochemical measurements were
performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat Solartron 1286 electrochemical interface. The light
source was a 150 W Xenon arc lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter (100 mW cm-2, Newport
66477-150XF-R1) calibrated by a photodetector (Gentec-EO). PEC measurements were
performed in a three electrode configuration in a quartz cell in Ar-saturated 0.5 M NaOH (pH=13.0)

5

electrolyte. Hematite/FTO photoelectrode was used as the working electrode, a Pt mesh and
Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and the reference electrodes, respectively. Potentiodynamic
measurements with a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 in the potential window of 0.4–1.6 VRHE were
performed to probe the photocurrents.
Open-circuit potentials were measured in O2-saturated 0.5 M NaOH electrolyte, and each
dark/light potential reading was obtained after stabilization for at least 30 min with oxygen gas
bubbling into the electrolyte.
2.4. Impedance spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky plots. Dark and light impedance
spectroscopy measurements were carried out in O2-saturated 0.5 M NaOH electrolyte on a
Solartron 1260 impedance analyzer combined with potentiostat Solartron 1286 in the frequency
range between 10 mHz and 10 kHz using 5 mV AC amplitude. Mott-Schottky plots were obtained
by fitting the dark impedance spectroscopy data. The sampling was taken every 50 mV in the
potential region of 0.78-1.18 VRHE, and prior to impedance measurement, hematite was stabilized
at the measuring potential for 30 min. Light impedance spectroscopy was carried out at 1.18 VRHE
and 0.98 VRHE under AM 1.5 G illumination. Data analysis was performed with ZView software.
2.5. Materials characterizations. The surface morphology of hematite was examined with a
scanning electron microscope (SEM, Ultra 55, Carl Zeiss) operated at an accelerating voltage of
10 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done using a VG ESCALAB
220iXL spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific) equipped with an Al Kα monochromatic source
and a magnetic lens system. Mössbauer spectroscopy was done with conversion electron
Mössbauer spectroscopy mode (CEMS) with electrons of about 5-10 keV. Raman spectra were
recorded on Labram confocal Raman spectroscopy system, Jobin Yvon. X-ray diffraction (XRD)

6

measurements were conducted by a Bruker−Siemens D500 X-ray Diffractometer. AFM was
conducted on Agilent AFM5500 scanning probe microscope.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. PEC performance of hematite. Hematite nanorods on FTO were obtained by annealing
the hydrothermally grown β-FeOOH nanorods in air at 550 oC for 2 h and then at 800 oC for 10
min. The as-prepared hematite shows a photocurrent density of ~0.9 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE, and
~1.6 mA cm-2 at 1.6 VRHE, which are similar to previous reports in Ref. 4-5, 16.
The same hematite was then polarized at a slightly negative potential of 0.2 VRHE (−0.78 V vs.
Ag/AgCl) for 200 s to incorporate proton/e- couples (protonation). After the 1st protonation, at
highly positive potentials the hematite shows higher photocurrent densities than the as-prepared
one (Figure 1a), but has lower photocurrent densities than the as-prepared one at moderately
positive potentials between ~1.0 VRHE and ~1.35 VRHE.
After protonation, hematite was annealed in air under a temperature of 120 oC for 1 h.
Temperature and time were optimized by a series of annealing test under various temperature from
80 oC to 250 oC for different time (see Supporting Information Figure S1). This annealing
treatment can improve photocurrent densities throughout the whole scanned potential region. It is
worth mentioning that no color changes were observed between the as-prepared, protonated and
annealed hematite, which has reddish orange color as shown in Figure S2a.
After the 2nd protonation process, the photocurrent density curve of hematite shows similar
features as that of the 1st protonated hematite. Only under highly positive potentials, the 2nd
protonated hematite has higher photocurrent densities than the 1st annealed hematite. Again, the

7

2nd annealed hematite shows a further overall improvement throughout the whole scanned
potentials compared to the 1st annealed hematite. After these two rounds of protonation/annealing
treatment, hematite has a photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE, twice of that for asprepared hematite. In addition, the photocurrent onset potential is negatively shifted by ~80 mV
in comparison to the as-prepared hematite. It is also noteworthy that the 2nd protonated hematite
exhibits improved photocurrent densities than the 1st protonated hematite and the as-prepared
sample. It is most likely that the relatively low temperature annealing process did not remove all
the introduced protons, instead some of the protons are resistant to the annealing treatment. The
3rd protonated hematite exhibits better performance than the 2nd protonated one, however, the
following 3rd annealing treatment does not obviously improve the performance of hematite.
A layer of Co-Pi cocatalyst was photo-electrodeposited on the processed hematite, and the
photocurrent density is also shown in Figure 1a. Co-Pi decorated-hematite has a photocurrent
density of ~2.7 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE, and ~3.6 mA cm-2 at 1.6 VRHE, which is comparable to the
benchmark performances previously reported for hematite with different morphologies such as Tidoped hematite nanoparticles,19 IrO2-loaded hematite cauliflowers.7 The stability test show that
the Co-Pi decorated-hematite has a photocurrent density of ~2.4 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE after 5 h
test (see Figure 1b).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization was used to investigate the morphology
changes of the as-prepared and treated hematite samples, which were obtained by cutting a single
hematite followed by different treatments. Figure 1c-e show the typical features of hematite
nanorods, which are similar to previous reports in literature.18,

40, 42

Two typical features of

nanorods are observed. One type is round and vertical to the substrate, while the other is more
elongated and tilted to the substrate. The amount ratios between the two nanorods for these three

8

samples seem to be not uniform according to the SEM and AFM images (Figure S5), however, a
meaningful correlation between this phenomenon and the protonation/annealing treatment cannot
be directly made. It is more likely that this discrepancy forms due to the collapse, shrink, and
coalescence of β-FeOOH precursors during the high temperature sintering process, which is also
one of the reasons that the photocurrents of the as-prepared hematite are not always the same but
rather fluctuates in a range. In our experiments, the photocurrent densities of as-prepared hematite
at 1.23 VRHE are found in the range of 0.9-1.2 mA cm-2. In literature, photocurrent densities4-5, 1718

with an even larger dispersion have also been reported between 0.6−1.3 mA cm-2 for hematite

nanorod photoanodes at 1.23 VRHE.
To clarify the effects of protonation and annealing treatment, a control sample was annealed at
120 oC for 1 h without beforehand protonation (Figure S2b). The annealing process alone leads to
a slight improvement in the photocurrent densities only at very high potentials, and the onset
potential remains the same. In the second round treatment, both protonation and annealing were
applied, and then a smaller onset potential and higher photocurrent are observed.
The change tendencies of photocurrents after protonation and annealing treatment are consistent
for different samples, in spite of the fluctuated initial photocurrents, as shown in Figure 1, S1 and
S2. Therefore, it would still be plausible to conclude that this protonation-annealing treatment is
an effective strategy to enhance the performances for hematite photoanode.
3.2. Photocurrents of water and H2O2 oxidation. To understand the effects of protonation
and annealing treatment on hematite, H2O2 was used as hole scavenger in electrolyte. The
oxidation of H2O2 is thermodynamically more facile than oxidation of water, and has a rate
constant 10-100 times higher than that of water.23 Thus the oxidation of H2O2 is considered as a

9

process with minimal losses of holes at the surface, reflecting mainly the bulk charge separation
properties of hematite. A smaller gap between the oxidation photocurrents of H2O2 and H2O
indicates less surface recombination of charge carriers.
It is noteworthy that the same hematite (before loading Co-Pi) as in Figure 1 was used to probe
the photocurrent densities for H2O2 oxidation. Figure 2a-c show the comparisons between the
photocurrent densities of H2O2 and water oxidation for as-prepared, protonated and annealed
hematite. The gap between the photocurrent densities of H2O2 oxidation and H2O oxidation
increases in the following order: annealed < as-prepared < protonated, indicating that the
protonated sample suffers from the most severe losses of holes at the surface or close to the surface,
while the annealed hematite has the lowest surface recombination.
The bulk charge efficiency can be obtained by dividing the photocurrent JH2O2 over Jabs
(absorption derived maximum photocurrent) assuming the charge injection efficiency is 100% in
the presence of H2O2.23 Jabs was calculated by integrating the light absorption of each sample with
respect to AM 1.5G spectrum. The bulk charge separation efficiency is thus calculated and plotted
in Figure 2d. Clearly, the protonated and annealed hematite both have enhanced charge separation
efficiency in the bulk, while the former has the highest value, most likely due to higher majority
carrier transport and lower bulk recombination. This reduced bulk recombination has been
observed on rutile TiO2 nanoparticle electrodes,31 and explained by the reduction of deep electron
traps at the grain boundary as a result of proton incorporation.
To summarize, the protonation improves the bulk charge separation efficiency but introduces
more surface recombination. The annealing treatment can reduce the surface recombination at the

10

sacrifice of certain bulk properties, although it still has higher charge separation efficiency than
the as-prepared hematite.
3.3. Impedance spectroscopy measurements under light. Impedance spectroscopy were
measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm-2) to further understand the effects of
protonation and annealing on the bulk electron transport and solid-electrolyte interface charge
transfer processes. Figure 3a shows the Nyquist plots acquired at 1.18 VRHE under illumination for
as-prepared and processed hematite. The equivalent circuit8, 13 shown in the inset of Figure 3a was
used to fit the data, which includes both the bulk electron transport and solid-electrolyte charge
transfer processes. Here the bulk includes both space charge and Helmholtz layers. Figure 3b
reports the fitted resistances and time constants for bulk electron transport and interface charge
transfer at 1.18 VRHE.
The protonated hematite has the smallest bulk resistance and time constant, but the largest
charge transfer resistance and time constant. This is consistent with the conclusion derived from
the analysis of the photocurrent measurements for water and H2O2 oxidation that the protonation
improves the bulk charge separation efficiency but also introduces more surface recombination.
Water oxidation on metal oxide electrodes is believed to proceed from surface hydroxyl
intermediate states formed by hole transfer to a surface-coordinated water and a concomitant
deprotonation.20, 43-45 The extra protons near the surface of the protonated hematite probably inhibit
the hole transfer to water, which results in large resistance Rct and time constant (RC)ct for charge
transfer process.
The annealed hematite has the smallest charge transfer resistance and time constant, as well as
the second smallest bulk resistance and time constant, which is also in good agreement with the

11

photocurrent measurements. It is most likely that the annealing process removes mainly the
protons near the surface, largely suppressing the surface recombination while still preserving
relatively high bulk charge separation efficiency.
Impedance spectra were also collected at 0.98 VRHE (Figure S3a) and the fitted parameters are
shown in Figure S3b. The protonated hematite has the largest time constants for both the bulk
transport and charge transfer processes, which is consistent with its very low photocurrents at low
potentials.
3.4. Mott-Schottky plots. As previously mentioned, some protons may be resistant to the
annealing process. If this is true, the donor density of the annealed hematite should be higher than
that of as-prepared one. Impedance spectroscopy data measured in dark were fitted according to
the equivalent circuit in the inset of Figure 4a, which has been proved to best represent the dark
phenomena.8 The fitted space charge layer capacitances were used to plot Mott-Schottky curves
(Figure 4a), which enables us to obtain the donor density and flat band potential. The details for
fitting impedance spectra, calculating donor density and flat band are shown in the Supporting
Information.
The donor densities obtained from Mott-Schottky plots are shown in Figure 4b. The as-prepared
hematite has a donor density of 1.54×1019 cm-3, which is comparable to literature reports on Sndoped hematite17 and Si-doped hematite.8 Repeated protonation progressively increases the donor
density, which rises up to 4.48×1019 cm-3 after the 3rd protonation, contributing to the high
conductivity and charge separation efficiency in bulk for protonated hematite. The 3rd annealed
hematite still has higher donor densities than the as-prepared hematite. This confirms that residual

12

protons are present in the annealed hematite, probably due to higher removal energy barriers of
the protons in the bulk than those near the surface.
It is noteworthy that the flat band potential slightly shifts to more positive values (downward
shift) upon repeated protonation and annealing (Figure 4b). According to eq 1,46-47 the width of
the space charge layer Wsc under a certain potential V can be obtained when the flat band potential
Vfb and donor density ND are known:

1/2
 2(V − V )εε 
fb 0 ) 
W = 


sc
eN
D



(1)

The calculated Wsc for different samples at 1.23 VRHE are listed in Figure 4b. Wsc decreases
upon protonation, and increases upon annealing. A thin space charge layer cannot effectively block
the back recombination of surface accumulated holes with bulk electrons.48 This explains the
relatively low photocurrents for water oxidation of the protonated sample at moderately anodic
potentials. While at highly positive potentials, the space charge layer becomes wide enough to
block the back recombination, leading to similar or higher photocurrents than those measured for
the as-prepared hematite.
The influence of oxygen vacancies on the donor density can be ruled out since oxygen vacancy
in hematite has very high formation energy of ~20-23 eV,49-50 which makes the formation of extra
oxygen vacancy almost impossible at 120 oC. Besides, the minor change in photovoltage (Figure
S4) cannot be the main reason for enhanced PEC performance.
3.5. Mechanism discussion. The protonation treatment was conducted under 0.2 VRHE (-0.78
V vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0. 5 M NaOH in our experiment. According to the Pourbaix diagram of Fe-H2O

13

system,51 this potential still corresponds to the region of Fe2O3(s). Previous reports on the
electrochemical reduction of hematite34, 39-40 often ascribe the enhancement of photocurrents to the
formation of more conductive Fe3O4 or even metal Fe. However, more negative potentials
(between -1 V and -1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl or SCE.) were used in these works to reduce hematite,
which correspond to the region of Fe3O4 or even more reduced phases in Pourbaix diagram. In
addition, Cibrev et al.40 have elaborated the electronic structure changes of hematite after
electrochemical reduction through photoemission (PES) and X-ray absorption (XAS) and
demonstrated that only potentials more negative than -1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl are enough to introduce
new electronic states in the vicinity of valance band of hematite.
In this work, however, no evidence supports the presence of Fe3O4 or more reduced phases of
iron. Figure 5 shows XPS, Raman and Mössbauer spectra for as-prepared and treated hematite. No
obvious differences are observed between the as-prepared, protonated and annealed hematite for
all the spectra. XPS spectra show that binding energies of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 are 710.3 eV and
723.6 eV, respectively, along with a typical satellite peak at 718.5 eV, which is characteristic of
Fe3+. 40, 52 However, no shoulder close to the Fe 2p3/2 peak corresponding to the presence of Fe2+
was detected after the protonation or annealing treatments. Raman and Mössbauer spectra are also
virtually the same for as-prepared, protonated and annealed hematite, only showing the
characteristics of Fe2O3. Besides, XRD patterns in Figure S6 also confirm that crystallographic
structures are identical for as-prepared and treated hematite. All these evidences verify that our
electrochemical reduction do not involve the formation of magnetite Fe3O4 or metal Fe.
Based on the above discussions, it would be justified to draw the conclusion that the
enhancement of photocurrents in this work is related with protons instead of the reduction of Fe2O3.

14

A new mechanism is proposed for this work to explain the protonation process of hematite, which
can be written similar to the Volmer equation:53-54
Fe2 O3 +H2 O+e- =Fe2 O3 Hads/int +OH-

(2)

Protons can be adsorbed onto or intercalated into hematite, which simultaneously introduces
electrons into Fe2O3 and generates OH- ions in the local region. Here electrons increase the donor
density in the bulk of hematite, which is reflected by the improved charge separation efficiency
and conductivity in bulk for protonated hematite. But protons near the surface may also act as
recombination centers thus deteriorate the photocurrent under relatively low bias. It is found that
a low temperature annealing treatment can recover the surface properties. This has never been
reported in literature. We thus proposed a combined protonation-annealing treatment for hematite.
After annealing treatment, extra protons on the surface were removed and thus the surface
recombination was also impressed.
Furthermore, previous reports on electrochemical reduction of hematite used sample prepared
under a relatively low temperature of 550 oC34 or 600 oC39-40, which have very low photoactivity.
For hematite with low donor densities, the electrochemical reduction of hematite can improve the
photocurrents for water splitting through the enhancement of the majority carrier transport. Still,
photocurrent densities of less than 1 mA cm-2 are reported for optimized pretreated hematite at
1.23 VRHE in these works.34, 39-40 In our work, however, an additional activation treatment by
sintering hematite at 800 oC for 10 min was adopted to enable the diffusion of Sn from fluorinedoped SnO2 (FTO) substrate to hematite.4-5, 16-18 Therefore, this work used highly-doped hematite,
which is also verified by the much higher photocurrents in our case. Although Shangguan et al.34
also reported a Ti-doped hematite, the annealing treatment under 550 oC seems inefficient to

15

incorporate enough Ti4+ in the crystalline structure of hematite, which shows a very low
photocurrent of ~400 μA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE in comparison to 1.8 mA cm-2 in our case. Therefore,
it is worth nothing that our new understanding on the protonation treatment is based on hematite
with sufficiently high donor density.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, repeated protonation and annealing treatments can cathodically shift the onset
potential and improve photocurrents for hematite photoanode. Literature often ascribe the
enhancement in performance to the formation of Fe3O4 or metal Fe, however, it is demonstrated
that the enhancement is mainly related with the incorporation of proton/e- in this work. Protons
and electrons are incorporated into hematite in a way similar to Volmer reaction. The protonation
process increases the donor density, reduces bulk electron traps but introduces more surface
recombination. The subsequent low temperature annealing removes extra protons near the surface
to suppress surface recombination while preserving relatively high bulk charge separation
efficiency. For oxides with low donor densities, a negative polarization alone can improve the
photocurrents for water splitting through the enhancement of the majority carrier transport, as in
the case of low-doped Fe2O3.34, 39-40 However, for oxides with a sufficiently high donor density,
further increasing the donor density will reduce the photocurrents due to the increased
recombination near the surface. Our measurements show that a low temperature annealing
treatment can improve the surface properties while keeping a low bulk recombination.
