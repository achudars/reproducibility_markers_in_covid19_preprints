ABSTRACT
We present a new ground-based visual transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, obtained
as part of the ACCESS Survey. The spectrum was derived from four transits observed between 2015
and 2018, with combined wavelength coverage between 5,300 Å–9,000 Å and an average photometric
precision of 708 ppm in 230 Å bins. We perform an atmospheric retrieval of our transmission spectrum
combined with literature HST/WFC3 observations to search for the presence of clouds/hazes as well
as Na, K, Hα, and H2 O planetary absorption and stellar spot contamination over a combined spectral
range of 5,318 Å–16,420 Å. We do not detect a statistically significant presence of Na I or K I alkali
lines, or Hα in the atmosphere of WASP-43b. We find that the observed transmission spectrum can
be best explained by a combination of heterogeneities on the photosphere of the host star and a
clear planetary atmosphere with H2 O. This model yields a log-evidence of 8.26 ± 0.42 higher than a
flat (featureless) spectrum. In particular, the observations marginally favor the presence of large, lowcontrast spots over the four ACCESS transit epochs with an average covering fraction fhet = 0.27+0.42
−0.16 ,
and temperature contrast ∆T = 132 K ± 132 K. Within the planet’s atmosphere, we recover a log H2 O
+1.38
volume mixing ratio of −2.78−1.47
, which is consistent with previous H2 O abundance determinations
for this planet.

1. INTRODUCTION

Observations of exoplanetary atmospheres offer the
possibility of understanding the atmospheric physical
properties and chemical composition of those worlds, as

well as providing clues to their formation and evolution histories (e.g. Öberg et al. 2013; Moses et al. 2013;
Mordasini et al. 2016, Espinoza et al. 2017). The first
comparison studies of exoplanetary atmospheres using
transmission spectra (see, e.g., Sing et al. 2016; Crossfield & Kreidberg 2017), found evidence of a gradual
transition between clear and cloudy atmospheres, but
no clear correlation of that transition with other system
parameters, such as planetary mass, gravity, effective
temperature, or stellar irradiation levels, and the chemical composition of the star. Recently Pinhas et al. 2019
reanalyzed the Sing et al. 2016 sample and concluded
that the majority of hot Jupiters have atmospheres consistent with sub-solar H2 O abundances, with the log of
+0.46
+0.66
those values ranging from −5.04−0.30
to −3.16−0.69
.
High altitude clouds/hazes have been inferred in the
atmosphere of a number of exoplanets from scattering
slopes in the visible (e.g. Pont et al. 2008, 2013; Sing
et al. 2009, 2011, 2013; Gibson et al. 2013), and from
the damping of pressure-broadened alkali Na I and K I
lines originating from deeper within the atmosphere (e.g.
Charbonneau et al. 2002; Wakeford & Sing 2015). The
first detections of exoplanets with potentially clear atmospheres have only recently been made, e.g. WASP96b (Nikolov et al. 2018).
This field is currently at the point where a number
of efforts are underway to identify what system parameters, if any, correlate with the observed atmospheric
properties of exoplanets. For example, the relationship between chemical abundance in an exoplanet’s atmosphere and planet mass is actively being explored
(Helling et al. 2016; Sing et al. 2016; Kreidberg et al.
2014; Fraine et al. 2014). Ground-based (e.g., ACCESS 1 , GPIES 2 , VLT FORS2 3 , LRG-BEASTS 4 )
and space based surveys (PanCET 5 ) are working to
provide homogeneous spectra of a statistically significant number of exoplanet atmospheres in the search for
these correlations. In this paper, we present the ground
based visual to near-infrared (NIR) transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b obtained as part of
the ACCESS survey.

Jupiter discovered by Hellier et al. (2011) transiting a
V = 12.4 K7V type dwarf star (Ms = 0.717 ± 0.025 M ,
Rs = 0.667±0.010 R , Teff = 4520±120 K; Gillon et al.
2012) every 0.81 days. WASP-43 is unusually active for
its stellar type, as indicated by the presence of strong Ca
H and K lines and perhaps due to star-planet interactions in this very short period system (Staab et al. 2017).
Spitzer secondary eclipse data in the 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm
bands indicate brightness temperatures of 1670 ± 23 K
and 1514 ± 25 K, respectively, which rule out a strong
thermal inversion in the planet’s dayside photosphere
(Blecic et al. 2014). In addition, thermal emission observed in the K−band (Chen et al. 2014) agrees with
atmospheric models of WASP-43b, which predict poor
day-to-night heat redistribution in an atmosphere with
no thermal inversion present (Kataria et al. 2015).
The presence of water on the dayside of the planet
was observed with HST/WFC3 emission measurements
by Stevenson et al. (2014), with additional transmission
observations by Kreidberg et al. (2014) finding water
abundances comparable to solar values. In the visual
regime, the Gran Telescopio Canarias’s (GTC) visual
System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) instrument shows a tentative excess
in Rp /Rs at Na I and a complete lack of one near the
K I doublet (Murgas et al. 2014). That same study
also notes a trend of increasing planet-to-star radius ratio from 6,200 Å–7,200 Å and decreasing trend redward
of 7,200 Å. They attribute this pattern to the possible
presence of VO and TiO.
In this work, we search further for the presence of
Na I, K I, and Hα with new visual transit observations from Magellan/IMACS. In addition, we combine the HST/WFC3 transmission spectrum of WASP43b (Kreidberg et al. 2014) with the new visual data
to produce the full visual to NIR spectrum spanning
5,317.90 Å–16,420 Å that can further constrain the water absorption features present in the infrared spectrum
and provide new information about water abundance.
In our analysis, we find that the atmosphere of WASP43b is best described by a clear atmosphere with water
abundance consistent with solar. The planet’s spectrum
is also contaminated with stellar heterogeneity.
This paper is structured as follows: In Section 2,
we present our Magellan/IMACS observations. In Section 3 we outline the data reduction process used in our
observations and describe the selection of wavelength
bins to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), search
for atomic features, and compare to other results. We
present the detrended white and binned light curves for
each dataset. In Section 4, we give a qualitative analysis of the impact of observational stellar activity on the

3

ACCESS: Visual to NIR Transmission Spectrum of WASP-43b
resulting combined transmission spectra from different
visits. In Section 5, we present the final transmission
spectrum and also compare to the results of Murgas
et al. (2014). In Section 5.4, we present the results
of a retrieval modeling analysis on the combined ACCESS and HST transmission spectrum to find the best
fit transmission model when the presence of a heterogeneous stellar photosphere is also taken into account. We
summarize and conclude in Section 7.

We observed four transits of WASP-43b between 2015
and 2018 with the 6.5 meter Magellan Baade Telescope
and Inamori-Magella Areal Camera and Spectrograph
(IMACS, Dressler et al. 2006) as part of ACCESS. For
this study, we used the IMACS f/2 camera, which has
a 27.40 diameter field of view (FoV). With this large
FoV, IMACS is able to observe several nearby comparison stars simultaneously to WASP-43 to effectively remove common instrumental and atmospheric systematics. We selected comparison stars less than 0.5 magnitude brighter and 1 magnitude fainter that WASP-43
and closest in B − V /J − K color space, following Rackham et al. (2017). The selected comparison stars are
shown in Table 1. We used a custom designed multislit mask with 1200 × 2000 slits for the target and comparison stars. We used a similar calibration mask with
0.500 × 2000 for arc lamp wavelength calibrations. We
used a 300 line per mm grating with a 17.5◦ blaze angle for all four datasets to achieve an average resolving
power of R ∼ 1, 200, or approximately 4.7 Å per resolution element and access a full wavelength coverage
of 4,500 Å–9,260 Å. In practice, the SNR redward of
9,000 Å and blueward of 5,300 Å dropped to less than
25% of peak counts. For this reason, we omitted measurements outside of this range for the rest of the study.
We omitted data taken at an airmass (Z > 2.0) and/or
during twilight as well.

mode (30 s) for the 2015 datasets and in 2×2 binning in
Fast readout mode (31 s) for the 2017 and 2018 datasets
to take advantage of the reduced readout noise. During the observations, we adjusted the individual exposure times between 20–60 seconds to keep the number of
counts per pixel roughly between 30,000–35,000 counts
(ADU; gain = 1e− /ADU on f/2 camera), i.e., within the
linearity limit of the CCD (Bixel et al. 2019).
With the calibration mask in place, we took a series of
wavelength calibration arcs using a HeNeAr lamp before
each transit time-series observation. The narrower slit
width of the calibration mask increased the spectral resolution of the wavelength calibration as well as avoided
saturation of the CCD from the arc lamps. We took a
sequence of high SNR flats with a quartz lamp through
the science mask to characterize the pixel-to-pixel variations in the CCD. We ended up not applying a flat-field
correction to the science images after finding in all previous ACCESS studies (Rackham et al. 2017, Espinoza
et al. 2019; Bixel et al. 2019) that flat-fielding introduces
additional noise in the data and does not improve the
final results.

2.2. Data Collection

3.1. Reduction pipeline

We collected the two 2015 datasets on 14 Feb 2015
(UT 01:03 – 08:55, 433 science images) and 09 Mar 2015
(UT 04:35 – 08:22, 119 science images), collected a 2017
dataset on 10 Apr 2017 (UT 00:35 – 03:35, 197 science
images), and a final 2018 dataset on 03 Jun 2018 (UT
23:36 – 02:29, 156 science images). During the 2017
and 2018 nights of observing, we introduced a blocking
filter to reduce contamination from light at higher orders while also truncating the spectral range to 5,300 Å–
9,200 Å. We made observations in Multi-Object Spectroscopy mode with 2×2 binning in TURBO readout

We reduced the raw data using the ACCESS pipeline
described previously (Rackham et al. 2017, Espinoza
et al. 2019, Bixel et al. 2019). The detailed functions
of the pipeline, including standard bias and flat calibration, bad pixel and cosmic ray correction, sky subtraction, spectrum extraction, and wavelength calibration are described in detail in Jordán et al. (2013) and
Rackham et al. (2017). We briefly summarize the data
reduction here.
We applied the wavelength solution found with the arc
lamps to the first science image and the remaining sci-

ence image spectra were then cross-correlated with the
first’s. We calibrated the spectra from all stars to the
same reference frame by identifying shifts between Hα
absorption line minimum of the median spectra and air
wavelength of Hα, and interpolated the spectra onto a
common wavelength grid using b-splines. We aligned
all spectra to within 2 Å, which is less than the average
resolution element of 4.7 Å, assuming an average resolution of R = 1, 200 and shortest wavelength coverage
of 5,600 Å on IMACS. We also subtract scattered light
within IMACS along each slit for every exposure, as described by Espinoza et al. (2019).
The final results are sets of wavelength calibrated and
extracted spectra for the target and each comparison
star that can be used to produce integrated (white light,
Figure 1) or spectroscopically binned light curves. The
series of white light curves produced in this fashion informed which comparison stars to omit in the rest of the
analysis on a per dataset basis. Based on the deviations

of each comparison star’s flux from the general trend of
WASP-43b’s flux in Figure 1, we omitted comparison
star 5 from the first 2015 dataset (ut150224, Transit 1),
comparison stars 5 and 6 from the second 2015 dataset
(ut150309, Transit 2), comparison star 5 from the 2017
dataset (ut170410, Transit 3), and no comparison stars
from the 2018 dataset (ut180603, Transit 4).
With this set of good comparison stars established,
we made a normalized white light curve (Fdiv ) for each
observation by dividing the target WASP-43b flux FW43
by the sum of the N good comparison star fluxes (FCn ):

explored (see section 3.2.4) sometimes had different outlier points in their respective divided white light curves,
we omitted a super-set of outlier points from all datasets
to maintain uniformity and reduce systematics.
We detrended our original data, with the selected data
points and comparison stars for each transit epoch selected, using three different methods described in Section 3.2.
3.2. Light curve analysis
We applied three detrending and transit-fitting methods to our white light and wavelength binned data to
test our results and verify that they were not dependent on the method used. The three detrending methods we used were: polynomial wavelet (poly), polynomial wavelet followed by a common mode correction (poly+CMC), and Gaussian process combined with
principal component analysis (GP+PCA).
3.2.1. Polynomial wavelet detrending
We performed a simultaneous transit model and systematics detrending fit on each of the transit white light

curves shown in Figure 2 using our Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) code, described in detail in Rackham
et al. (2017). To briefly summarize, the divided light
curve model F (t, θ) can be written as:
F (t, θ, α) = f (θ)P (t, α),

(2)

where t is time, f (θ) is the analytic transit model described in Mandel & Agol (2002), θ is the vector of orbital and transit parameters (e, a/Rs , i, ω, T , t0 , b, u1 ,
u2 , Rp /Rs ), defined in Table 2, and α is a vector of
polynomial coefficients (α0 , α1 , . . . , αm ), where:
P (t, α) =

m=0

for an M th order polynomial that we fit to the out-of
transit (OOT) flux of Fdiv . We assumed a quadratic stellar limb darkening profile and sampled the limb darkening coefficients u1 and u2 according to Kipping (2013) to
allow uninformative (uniform) priors to be placed on the
transformed coefficients while avoiding the risk of sampling non-physical values. We fit the divided light curve

Figure 3. GP+PCA detrended white light curves (grey) and associated models (solid line) for a representative wavelength

in the analysis. We center our data 1 hour around t0 . The parameters for each transit fit are given in Table 3. The associated

obtained the final detrended model (Fdet ) by dividing
through by the OOT best-fit flux model P (t, α), such
that:
Fdiv
Fdet =

(4)
P (t, α)
We performed a simultaneous MCMC fitting of transit parameters with PyMC (Salvatier et al. 2016). The
likelihood was determined through the wavelet method
described in Carter & Winn (2009). The fitted parameters include the mid-transit time (t0 ), planet-to-star
radius ratio (Rp /Rs ), three coefficients (ai , i = 0, 1, 2)
for the second-order polynomial used to fit the baseline
out-of-transit trend, two parameters for the transformed
quadratic limb-darkening coefficients (q1 , q2 ), one noise
parameter (σw ) for uncorrelated “white” noise, and one
parameter (σr ) for correlated “red” noise. We found that
a second order polynomial fit the OOT flux better than
a lower order function.

We sampled t0 , σw , σr , q1 , and q2 with uniform priors,
αi with a Gaussian prior with a width set by bootstrapping the uncertainty on αi following Rackham et al.
(2017), and Rp /Rs with a Gaussian prior with spread
5×σRp /Rs , where Rp /Rs and σRp /Rs is used from the literature. We used five chains, each composed of 100,000
steps, and started them at the estimated location of
maximum a posteriori probability (MAP), using an additional 30,000 steps for burn-in. We thinned the chains
by sampling them at 10× their autocorrelation function
(ACF) half-life before combining them to produce the
final posterior distributions. Each Bin Scheme has a
corresponding source for the fixed system parameters,
and we list them in Table 2. We fit the white light
curve while keeping the mid-transit time t0 and average
transit depth Rp /Rs free.
We produced the binned light curves following the
same procedure for producing the WLCs, with the only
difference being that we kept the mid-transit time t0

found in the WLC analysis fixed when performing the
fits for Rp /Rs in each wavelength bin for Bin Schemes
1, 2, and 3, described in section 3.2.4.
3.2.2. Common-mode correction
Following Sedaghati et al. (2016), we divided the detrended WLC obtained in the polynomial detrending
method by its best-fit model to produce a common-mode
correction (CMC) residual. We then divided that residual through the binned light curves to remove wavelength independent variations. Next, we applied the
CMC correction to each Bin Scheme.
3.2.3. Gaussian process and principal component analysis
Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a powerful tool
for modeling data in the machine learning community
(Rasmussen & Williams 2005) that has started to gain
more popularity in the exoplanets field (see, e.g., Gibson et al. 2012, Aigrain et al. 2012). Gibson et al. (2012)
provides a good overview to this methodology applied to
exoplanet transit light curves. Applying this methodology for a collection of N measurements (f ), such as
the flux of a star measured over a time series, the log
marginal likelihood of the data can be written as:
1
1
log L(r|X, θ, φ) = − r > Σ−1 r − log |Σ|
2
2
N
−
log(2π) ,
2

(5)

where r ≡ f − T (t, φ) is the vector of residuals between
the data and analytic transit function T ; X is the N ×K
matrix for K additional parameters, where each row is
the vector of measurements xn = (xn,1 , · · · xn,K ) at a
given time n; θ are the hyperparameters of the GP; φ
are the transit model parameters; and Σ is the covariance of the joint probability distribution of the set of
observations f . In our analysis, we used six systematics
parameters: time, full width at half maximum (FWHM)
of the spectra on the CCD, airmass, position of the pixel
trace through each spectra on the chip of the CCD, sky
flux, and shift in wavelength space of the trace. We used
the Python package batman (Kreidberg 2015) to generate our analytic transit model. From here, the log posterior distribution log P(θ, φ|f , X) can be determined
by placing explicit priors on the maximum covariance
hyperparameters and the scalelength hyperparameters.
From P, the transit parameters can then be inferred by
optimizing with respect to θ and φ.
We accomplished the above optimization problem
with the Bayesian inference tool, PyMultiNest (Buchner et al. 2014), and computed the log likelihoods from
the GP with the george (Ambikasaran et al. 2014)
package. We implemented this detrending scheme by

7

simultaneously fitting the data with an exponential
squared kernel for the GP under the assumption that
points closer to each other are more correlated than
points farther apart. The PCA methodology follows
from Jordán et al. (2013) and Espinoza et al. (2019),
where M signals, Si (t), can be extracted from M comparison stars and linearly reconstructed according to
the eigenvalues, λi , of each signal. This allows for the
optimal extraction of information from each comparison
star to inform how the total flux of WASP-43 varies
over the course of the night. We Bayesian model averaged (BMA) the principal components together, which
were determined by fitting with one, then two, up to
M principal components, to create the final detrended
WLC and model parameters of interest. We present the
associated WLCs in Figure 3, the best fit parameters in
Table 3, and associated corner plots in Figures 10–13 in
the Appendix. Based on the quality of the fits, discussed
in Section 5.4, and to streamline our work, we show only
the results of this method for the transmission spectra
that informed our retrieval analysis.
We applied the same methodology on a wavelength bin
by wavelength bin basis to produce the simultaneously
fitted light curves for Bin Scheme 3 and create our final
transmission spectrum, shown in Figure 8. We used the
open source package, ld-exosim 6 , to determine that
a square-root limb darkening law was the most appropriate for WASP-43, and incorporated this into our GP
analysis. We present the final transmission spectrum
using this method in Figure 8.
3.2.4. White light curve and Binning Schemes
We applied the detrending methods described in Sections 3.2.1– 3.2.3 to the following wavelength binning
schemes in our analysis:
• Bin Scheme 1: A set of uniform bins centered
around the air wavelength values of key spectral
features (Na I-D, Hα, K I, Na I-8,200) to produce
a transmission spectrum focused around these features;
• Bin Scheme 2: identical binning and system parameters to Murgas et al. (2014) to directly compare our transmission spectra with the ones presented in that study;
• Bin Scheme 3: similar 230 Å binning and system
parameters to Kreidberg et al. (2014) to combine our visual measurement with their NIR measurements made with HST. We used this bin6

ning scheme to perform atmospheric retrievals described in Section 5.4. We centered 230 Å bins
around the vacuum wavelength locations of Na ID, Hα, K I, and Na I-8,200 using smaller bins when
necessary to have at least two wavelength bins between each feature.
We applied the poly+CMC detrending method described in Section 3.2.1 to all three Bin schemes and
applied the GP+PCA described in Section 3.2.3 to Bin
Scheme 2 (25 nm) and Bin Scheme 3 because of their
similar wavelength binning and wavelength coverage in
the visual (25 nm vs. 23 nm). This allowed us to directly compare detrending methods between our study
and Murgas et al. (2014).
We discuss each binning scheme in more detail in Sections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4. We also include the literature
values for system parameters used in each Bin Scheme
in Table 2. For Bin Scheme 1, where no associated literature values are being used for comparison, we adopt
the most up to date values from Hoyer et al. (2016).

4. STELLAR ACTIVITY

Before combining the transmission spectra from each
night, we first considered the impact of stellar photospheric heterogeneity, which can have an observable effect on transmission spectra (Pont et al. 2008, 2013; Sing
et al. 2011; Oshagh et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2018), even if
magnetically active regions are not occulted by the transiting exoplanet (McCullough et al. 2014; Rackham et al.
2018; Rackham et al. 2019; Apai et al. 2018). Qualitatively, global variations in stellar activity could manifest
themselves as an overall dimming or brightening of the
star, which could lead to significant variations in transit
depths. Changes in photometric activity roughly correlate with the covering fraction of starspots, which in turn
can modulate the luminosity of the star and impact observed transit depths (Berta et al. 2011). Furthermore,
those variations can be wavelength dependent, leading
to slopes with spurious spectral features in the transmission spectrum.

where y is the data, µ is the model, n is the number
of observations, and K is the covariance matrix. K describes the correlation weight between all possible pairs
of photometric measurements and is populated with the
GP kernel to quantify the correlation of pairs of observations. We used a gradient based optimization routine to
find the best fit hyperparameters and used the 15.6 day
stellar rotation period from Hellier et al. (2011). Figure 4 shows the GP regression model for the relevant
ASAS-SN data.
Figure 4 shows the complete ASAS-SN light curve,
and Figure 5 details the ASAS-SN photometry near each
of our transit epochs. Overall, the relative flux from the
photometric monitoring varies by as much as 3% from
the median value obtained from the GP. Observations
with ASAS-SN are too coarse to effectively sample the
photometric activity during times of transits. However,
this data still gives us a rough idea of differences in stellar flux between epochs.
We conclude that the photometric activity data alone
are not enough to constrain the contribution of unocculted heterogeneities on the surface of WASP-43b to
the resulting transmission spectrum. Nonetheless, we

argue that changes in disk coverage by unocculted heterogenieties likely drive the white-light light curve depth
variations that we observe between transit epochs. For
this reason, we calculate and apply transit depth offset corrections as described in Section 5.1 before building the final transmission spectrum. In Section 5.4 we
model the possible contribution of an unocculted heterogeneous photosphere to the resulting transmission spectrum without relying on photometric monitoring data.

Relative flux

The white light transit depths we observed (Table 3)
varied by as much as 1,869 ppm between transits. To
account for this offset between the datasets, we investigated the contribution due to stellar activity. Changes
in photometric activity roughly correlate with the covering fraction of starspots, which in turn can modulate
the luminosity of the star and impact observed transit
depths (Berta et al. 2011). To assess brightness variation
of WASP-43 over the time frame of our observations,
we used 15 Feb 2012 – 21 May 2018 activity data from
990 out-of-transit V-band images of WASP-43b taken by
Ohio State University’s All-Sky Automated Survey for
Supernovae7 (ASAS-SN) program (Shappee et al. 2014;
Kochanek et al. 2017).
The ASAS-SN photometric activity was sampled
much more coarsely than our transit observations, so
we used a regression routine (Alam et al. 2018) to fit
the data and estimate the amplitude of the photometric
variation induced by stellar activity during each of the
four transit epochs of WASP-43b. Following Alam et al.
(2018), we used a negative log likelihood kernel (ln L)
for the objective function given by:

and 1σ uncertainty (gray region) fit to ASAS-SN data are

5. TRANSMISSION SPECTRUM

5.1. Combining nights
The uncertainties in transit depths from our individual transits range from 250 ppm–880 ppm, which is not
enough to detect the atmosphere of WASP-43b (see Table 3). For example, a hydrogen dominated composition
for the atmosphere of WASP-43b would produce a signal ∆D of 435 ppm at 5 scale heights (based on eq. 11
of Miller-Ricci et al. 2009, and using the planet and star
parameters given in Section 1). Therefore, we needed to
combine the transmission spectra from the four transits
to be sensitive to atmospheric features of the planet.
Transit depths between different epochs varied as
much as 1867 ppm (see difference in depths between
Transits 3 and 4 in Table 3), an effect that we attribute
to stellar variability. We also expect some variability in
observed transit depths for two reasons: i) stellar activity is stronger in the visual portion of the spectrum

quantify the contribution of stellar activity to the transmission spectrum, but instead rely on the formalism discussed in
Section 5.4.

relative to in the IR, and ii) because of the large period
of time over which we collected our data. For example, Kreidberg et al. (2014) observed six transits over 1
month, while our data spans four transits over 3 years.
This leaves ample time for the star’s intrinsic brightness to change due to surface stellar heterogeneities and
impact measured transit depths.
To be able to combine the data from each transit
epoch, we needed to first consider potential effects introduced by stellar activity of WASP-43, as discussed
in Section 4. Typically, studies have used photometric activity as a proxy for the presence of these stellar heterogeneities, but this (compounded with the fact
that the photometric activity data we have is not well
sampled enough in time to cover the given transits) has
been shown to be insufficient to correct for these stellar
contributions to transit depth variations (McCullough
et al. 2014). Based on the lack of constraints on the
contribution of occulted heterogeneities on the stellar
photosphere to the transmission spectrum discussed in
Section 4, we averaged the transmission spectrum from
each night together, weighted by the wavelength dependent uncertainty estimated from the wavelength binned
fitting. Before taking this weighted average we first addressed the apparent offset visible in the resulting transmission spectra (colored points in Figure 8). We did
this by subtracting the mean white light transit depth
of the four nights from the transmission spectrum of
each night. After applying the offset, we combined the
four transit epochs by averaging the transmission spectra from each night together, weighted by the uncertainties in the wavelength dependent depths determined by
the fitting. We took the maximum of this asymmetrical uncertainty to be conservative in our weighting. We
applied this methodology to each Bin Scheme identified
in the following section. Effectively, retrievals on the
resulting transmission spectrum found probe for the average contribution from the stellar photosphere over all
transit events.

5.2. Bin Scheme 1: Species dependent binning
In this binning scheme, we set the wavelength bin sizes
based on the absorption band widths of features of interest, in particular: Na I-D, Hα, K I, and Na I-8,200.
We set the minimum bin size for a given feature to be
equal to the full width of its observed stellar absorption
line, including the contributions from the wings of the
line. This gives a set of 4 bin widths equal to 60, 10,
60, and 40 Å for the respective species listed above. For
each species, we mapped a region covering 5 times its
bin width above, centered on the air wavelength to resolve any potential peaks, and we used larger bins to
cover the rest of the spectrum. We produce the combined spectra in Figure 6 following this procedure for
the (poly+CMC) detrending scheme.
We observed an apparent peak near the Na I-8,200
line, but the fact that the only point far from the baseline is also far from the air wavelength for this species,
indicate that this peak is most likely due to residuals
from water tellurics. We also observed a potential K I
peak 1σ above the median in the bin two 10 Å immediately redward of its air wavelength location, but believe
that this is due to residual telluric absorption as well.
Furthermore, we do not detect this peak at all in the
GP+PCA detrended data. We also do not detect an
absorption peak near Na I-D or Hα. To set this Bin
Scheme apart from the other two Bin Schemes, we used
more up to date system parameters from Hoyer et al.
(2016).
5.3. Bin Scheme 2: Comparison to ground-based study
We applied the same detrending and combining methods using the system parameters reported by Murgas et al. (2014) to compare our transmission spectra
with those from their similar study of WASP-43b. We
adopted the following four wavelength bin schemes identified in their work: (i) 100 Å bins ranging from 5,445 Å–
8,845 Å, (ii) 250 Å bins ranging from 5,300 Å–9,050 Å,
(iii) 750 Å bins ranging from 5,300 Å–9,050 Å, (iv) 180 Å

bins centered near the K I 7,665 Å and 7,699 Å doublet,
to produce Figure 7.
Qualitatively, the shapes of the combined spectra in
each binning scheme tend to follow the same slight upward curving slope near 7,000 Å seen in Murgas et al.
(2014). Unlike their finding, we do not observe an excess
near 5,892.9 Å that would indicate the presence of Na I
in the atmosphere of WASP-43b.
5.4. Bin Scheme 3: Combining with NIR study
We used the same bin width and system parameters (Table 2) from Kreidberg et al. (2014) to combine
their NIR transmission spectrum with our visual spectrum. We found that although the polynomial+CMC
detrending method tended to produce smaller error bars
on average in the transmission spectrum (180 ppm vs.
210 ppm), GP+PCA does a better job overall at fitting

systematics in the light curves, resulting in an average
standard deviation across the transit epochs of 396 ppm
vs. 274 ppm in the WLC model residuals, respectively.
The average GP+PCA WLC residuals were also larger
than the average white noise of 146 ppm estimated in
the poly+CMC detrended WLCs, so the GP+PCA procedure was not over-fitting the data. For these reasons,
we adopted the GP+PCA detrended transmission spectrum, shown as black circles in Figure 8, as our final
spectrum (reported in Table 7), which we combined with
the NIR transmission spectrum from Kreidberg et al.
(2014) for the atmospheric retrieval analysis.
6. ATMOSPHERIC RETRIEVAL ANALYSIS

With the final combined visual+NIR transmission
spectrum from Section 5.4, we searched for signals in
the atmosphere of WASP-43b. We used a Bayesian at-

to be a spurious detection. For example, we do not observe this peak in the GP+PCA detrended data. From left to right, the

mospheric retrieval code based on the same nested sampling Bayesian inference software we used for performing
the GP+PCA detrending, PyMultiNest. The details
of the retrieval code are given in our previous study of
WASP-19b (Espinoza et al. 2019), and we only briefly
summarize the methodology here.
Following the semi-analytical formalism from Bétrémieux
& Swain (2017) and Heng & Kitzmann (2017), we
assume an isothermal and isobaric atmosphere, with
an optically thick base region with radius (Rp /Rs )0
and reference pressure P0 , which we interpret as the
cloud-top pressure. Above this region is an optically
thin planetary atmosphere with average temperature
T that can have either (i) a set of atomic and molecular species and/or (ii) a scattering haze defined by
σhaze (λ) = aσ0 (λ/λ0 )γhaze (MacDonald & Madhusudhan 2017), where σ0 = 5.31 × 10−27 cm2 is the Rayleigh
scattering cross-section of H2 at the reference wavelength λ0 = 350 nm, and a and γhaze are free parameters. We constrain γhaze to be between 0 (uniform
opacity) and -4 (Rayleigh scattering) to allow for a better constraint on a. Transmission spectra from separate
studies can be combined by retrieving for an offset between the different datasets. A detailed overview of the
retrieval framework is given in Appendix D of Espinoza
et al. (2019).

Additionally, we explored the impact of a heterogeneous stellar photosphere on the observed transmission
(Pinhas et al. 2018) by following the formalism described
by Rackham et al. (2018); Rackham et al. (2019). To
summarise directly from the schematic in Figure 1 of
Rackham et al. (2018): during a transit, exoplanet
atmospheres are illuminated by the portion of a stellar photosphere immediately behind the exoplanet (the
transit chord). Changes in transit depth must be measured relative to the spectrum of this light source. However, the lightsource is generally assumed to be the diskintegrated spectrum of the star. Any differences between
the assumed and actual light sources will lead to apparent variations in transit depth.
In this framework, stellar contamination of the transmission spectrum from unocculted star spots and faculae are considered by placing constraints on the allowed
spot and faculae covering fractions using a set of rotating photosphere models and then translating the covering fractions of potential stellar contamination in the
transmission spectrum. We incorporate this transit light
source (TLS) effect into our retrieval framework with a
three-parameter model for the stellar photosphere to fit
this simultaneously with the planet’s atmosphere. The
three parameters are: Tchord , the effective temperature
of the transit chord; Thet , the mean effective temperature of the heterogeneous features not occulted by the

ACCESS: Visual to NIR Transmission Spectrum of WASP-43b
transit chord; and fhet , the fraction of the projected stellar disk covered by these heterogeneous features. The
impact of these heterogeneities on the transmission spectrum are expressed by the wavelength dependent corrective factor λ on the transit depth, where:

(7)
Here Rp,λ and Rp,λ,0 are the apparent and actual planetary radius measured at wavelength λ, respectively,
Sλ,het is the spectrum of the unocculted photosphere
determined by Thet , and Sλ,chord is the spectrum of the
portion of the photosphere inside of the transit chord.
Following previous studies (e.g., McCullough et al. 2014;
Rackham et al. 2017), we use PHOENIX stellar spectra
(Husser et al. 2013) to model the emergent spectra of
the photospheric components.
As Rackham et al. (2018) note, this formalism assumes
that the transit chord can be described by a single emergent spectrum. Although this is not guaranteed for any
one of our transits, they note that this formalism also
holds for transits in which an occulted spot or faculae
crossing event is present in the transit signal above the
observational uncertainty and taken into account in the
transit modeling. We also explored more complex models including multiple spot and faculae covering fractions
but we found that the data did not warrant the additional complexity of such a model.
Our combined retrieval approach uses the posterior Bayesian evidence Z ≡ P(D|H) computed by
PyMultiNest, which is the probability of the data D
given the hypothesis H, to perform model comparisons.
This property of the nested sampling algorithm allows us
to study how complex our models have to be to explain
the observed distortions to the light curve (such as number of spots) via the posterior odds, P(Hn |D)/P(Hk |D),
where the joint probability P(Hn |D) = P (D|Hn )P(Hn ),
with P(Hn ) being the prior probability on the hypothesis Hn . If we approximate model n and model k as
having the same prior distribution on their respective
hypothesis Hn , Hk , then the posterior odds simplify to
just the ratio of the evidences,
P(Hn |D)
P(D|Hn )
Zn

≡
P(Hk |D)
P(D|Hk )

.

(8)

In log-space, this is the difference of the logs of each evidence and is denoted as ∆ ln Z ≡ ln Zn − ln Zk . In the
context of this study, ∆ ln Z is a measure of how statistically different a given model (Zn ) is from a flat atmospheric model (Zk ≡ Zflat ). Trotta (2008) and Benneke
& Seager (2013) review how these log-odds translate

13

to frequentist significance hypothesis testing. We note
from that work that absolute log-odds below 1 are usually considered inconclusive, near 2.5 can be interpreted
as moderate evidence, and higher than 5 can be interpreted as highly significant. It is important to caution
though that frequentist hypothesis testing has only one
null hypothesis, whereas proper Bayesian model comparison considers a range of possible hypotheses, which
limits the comparison with frequentist methods.
6.1. Retrieval results
We fit the combined GP+PCA ACCESS detrended
spectrum and the HST/WFC3 NIR spectrum from Kreidberg et al. (2014) using the retrieval code described in
the previous section. We fit for an offset between the two
datasets, and a range of models. Those include combinations of clear and cloudy/hazy atmospheres with Na,
K, and H2 O and contamination of the planet’s transmission spectrum by stellar surface heterogeneity. Table 4
shows the prior distributions of the parameters used in
the models. We used the prescription provided by Benneke & Seager (2013, Table 2) to interpret our relative
log evidences (Table 6). Based on their values, we find
that they are all register as a strong detection, with no
one model being statistically more likely than another.
Although, the model with the largest log evidence relative to a flat atmosphere (∆ ln Z = 8.26) is the one
including stellar heterogeneity, combined with a clear
atmosphere with H2 O (but no Na or K). We adopt that
model as the one that best fits the data and show it
in Figure 9. From this model, we estimate an average
spot contrast of 132 K ± 132 K and covering fraction of

7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have collected, extracted, and combined transmission spectra of WASP-43b from Magellan/IMACS over
four transit epochs spanning the years 2015 to 2018. We
combined this with IR data from HST/WFC3 to create
a transmission sprectrum with a total wavelength coverage of 5,318 Å–16,420 Å. We analyzed the combined
spectrum in a dynamic nested sampling framework with
NIR data from Kreidberg et al. (2014), extending up to
16,420 Å to search for the presence of different species.
Assuming a water volume mixing ratio of 6.1 × 10−4 for
a planetary atmosphere with solar abundances (Kreidberg et al. 2014), our retrieval yields a log H2 O volume
+65.26
mixing ratio of −2.78+1.38
−1.47 . (2.72−0.09 solar). Our retrieved water abundance is consistent with the 1σ range

found by the joint transmission and emission spectrum
analysis in Kreidberg et al. (2014, 0.4 − 3.5 solar) and
phase curve analysis in Stevenson et al. (2014). Our retrieved planetary temperature is also consistent with the
ranges predicted from the more recent 2.5D theoretical
phase curve retrievals of the terminator region in Irwin
et al. (2019, Figure 9). In the visual spectrum we do not
observe a statistically significant excess of K I given the
data, as reported in Murgas et al. (2014). We also do
not observe the presence of Na I or Hα in our combined
spectra.
Our analysis also investigates the contribution of stellar heterogeneities to observed transmission spectra,

given that WASP-43 is an active star. The best fitting
model to our transmission spectrum calls for the presence of spots in the surface of the star being a more favored model that a model with atmospheric hazes. However, we do note that the impact on the spectrum from
both hazes and the contamination from surface stellar
heterogeneities can be degenerate, and given the quality
of the current data it is not possible to fully distinguish
between the two.
As the sample of available transmission spectra of different planets increases, it will become useful to compare their measured spectra and other system parameters (e.g., stellar irradiation levels, spectral type, metal-

Figure 14. Binned light curves for Transit 1 shown in Figure 8. Column 1 shows the raw observed flux, Column 2 shows
the GP+PCA detrended flux and model, and Column 3 shows the residuals. We labeled the wavelength range of each bin in
Column 3 as well and marked the bins centered around the vacuum wavelength of potential features of interest in bold. We
centered all data 1 hour around the fitted mid-transit time t0 from the corresponding WLC in Figure 3. We share the binned
transit data in Table 7.
