Abstract. Suppose that A ⊂ R has positive upper density,
|A ∩ I|
lim sup

|I|
|I|→∞
and P (t) ∈ R[t] is a polynomial with no constant or linear term, or more generally
a non-flat curve. Then for any R0 ≤ R sufficiently large, there exists some xR ∈ A
so that
|{0 ≤ t < T : xR − t ∈ A, xR − P (t) ∈ A}|
inf
≥ cP · δ 2
R0 ≤T ≤R

for some absolute constant cP > 0, that depends only on P .

1. Introduction
A beautiful result in Euclidean Ramsey theory, due to Furstenberg, Katznelson,
and Weiss, [7], concerns the presence of additive structure in sets of positive density
inside of the plane, i.e. those (measurable) sets for which
d∗ (A) := lim sup
|Q|→∞

|A ∩ Q|
> 0;
|Q|

here {Q} are axis-parallel cubes.
Theorem 1.1. Suppose that A ⊂ R2 has d∗ (A) > 0. Then there exists a threshold r0
so that for every r ≥ r0 there exists xr , yr ∈ A so that
|xr − yr | = r.
This result was first proven by ergodic theoretic techniques, but it has since been
recovered by different methods: geometric [6] and probabilistic [19], and – most significant for this paper – Fourier analytic [1].
Indeed, in his paper, A Szemerédi type theorem for sets of positive density in Rk
[1], Bourgain developed a powerful but elementary Fourier analytic approach through
which he not only recovered Theorem 1.1, but also was able to reveal the presence
of additional additive structure inside of dense subsets of the plane, via the following
pinned variant of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 1.2. Suppose that A ⊂ R2 has d∗ (A) > 0. Then there exists a threshold
r0 so that for every r ≥ r0 there exists xr ∈ A so that for all r0 ≤ s ≤ r, there exists
some ys ∈ A so that
|xr − ys | = s.
To the extent that the core of Bourgain’s argument amounted – essentially – to
appropriate applications of the uncertainty principle, his methods have proven quite
robust in addressing other problems in Euclidean Ramsey theory, see for instance [3],
[5], [9], [17], as well as in the discrete context, [14], [15], [16], [18].
In this note, we apply his method in the bi-linear setting, as we consider the issue
of Non-Linear Roth’s Theorem (in the Euclidean context).
The first progress towards understanding non-linear Roth-type patterns
{x, x + t, x + P (t)}, P ∈ R[−]
inside non-trivial subsets of the real line was made by Bourgain, [2]. In particular,
he proved the following theorem.
Theorem 1.3. Let N ≥ 1, δ > 0 be small, and let A ⊂ [0, N] have |A| ≥ δN, and
d ≥ 2 be arbitrary. Then there exists
x, x − t, x − td ∈ A
for some t ≥ cδ · N 1/d , for some absolute constant cδ .
In [4], this result was extended to handle polynomial curves P (t) ∈ R[t] without
constant or linear terms.
Both results are a consequence of the following proposition. With
Z
1 r
P
f (x − t)g(x − P (t)) dt,
Br (f, g)(x) := Br (f, g)(x) :=
r 0
Proposition 1.4. Let δ > 0 be small, and let A ⊂ [0, 1] have |A| ≥ δ. If P (t) is a
polynomial as above, then there exists a lower bound
h1A , B1 (1A , 1A )i ≥ cδ,kP k ,
for some cδ,kP k > 0 which depends on δ and kP k, the ℓ1 sum of the coefficients of P .
In this paper, we amplify this proposition as follows. First, we allow for the presence of non-flat P , functions introduced and studied by Lie in his treatment of bilinear Hilbert transforms with curvature, [12] and [13], in the definition of Br = BrP .
Roughly speaking, non-flat curves are locally differentiable curves which do not “resemble a line” near the origin or ∞. For instance, in addition to the types of polynomials discussed above, real analytic functions which vanish to degree two at the
origin are non-flat, as are real laurent polynomials of the form

or even linear combinations of functions of the form
|t|α | log |t||β , α, β ∈ R, α 6= 0, 1.
For a more precise definition, see [12, §2].
Our result is then the following.
S
Proposition 1.5. Suppose that (0, 1] = J∈P J is an admissible partition of intervals, in that each J contains at least one dyadic rational of the form 2−k . If A ⊂ [0, 1]
has |A| ≥ δ, then there exists a subset Q ⊂ P so that
inf |h1A , inf Br (1A , 1A )i| ≥ cP · δ 3

(1.6)

J∈Q

r∈J

for some absolute cP > 0. Moreover, there exists some absolute constant CP so that
|{J : J ∈ P r Q}| ≤ CP · δ −5 log(δ −1 ).
Remark 1.7. For polynomial P , both cP , CP depend only on kP k.
The following corollary, a quantitative improvement over [4], immediately presents.
Corollary 1.8. In the setting of Proposition 1.5, for any ǫ > 0, there exists an
absolute constant cǫ,P so that
inf |h1A , Br (1A , 1A )i| ≥

1≥r>0

cǫ,P
3
−5−ǫ · cP · δ ,
δ

where cP is as in (1.6), and similarly cǫ,P is determined by kP k for polynomial P .
Our main result follows from Proposition 1.5 by arguing by contradiction and
rescaling as in [1]; this argument is by now standard, and has appeared in the abovediscussed works, and so we omit it.
Theorem 1.9. Suppose A ⊂ R has positive upper density d∗ (A) = δ. Then for every
R ≥ R0 sufficiently large there exists an xR ∈ A so that
|{0 ≤ t ≤ T : xR − t ∈ A, xR − P (t) ∈ A}|
&P δ 2 .

For ease of presentation, we will establish our main results only in the case of
P (t) = t2 , as the complications that arise in increasing the generality are essentially
notational.

1.2. Notation. Here and throughout, e(t) := e2πit . Throughout, C will be a large
number which may change from line to line.
We will henceforth re-define
Z
Bk (f, g)(x) := f (x − t)g(x − t2 )ρk (t) dt
where ρk (t) := 2k ρ(2k t), and ρ is an appropriate bump function.
We will also make use of certain Fourier projection operators: we let φ denote a
Schwartz function which satisfies
1|ξ|≤1/8 ≤ φb ≤ 1|ξ|≤1/2 ,

and set φk (t) := 2k φ(2k t).
We will make use of the modified Vinogradov notation. We use X . Y , or Y & X,
to denote the estimate X ≤ CY for an absolute constant C. We use X ≈ Y as
shorthand for Y . X . Y . We also make use of big-O notation: we let O(Y ) denote
a quantity that is . Y . If we need C to depend on a parameter, we shall indicate
this by subscripts, thus for instance X .δ Y denotes the estimate X ≤ Cδ Y for some
Cδ depending on δ. We analogously define Oδ (Y ).
2. Preliminaries
Before turning to the proof, we need to collect various results from Euclidean
harmonic analysis. The first is essentially a martingale inequality, and was observed
by Bourgain in [2]; see [4] for a proof. m
Lemma 2.1. Suppose that 1 ≥ f ≥ 0 is supported in [0, 1]. Then for any r, s > 0,

The second is a special case of a result of Li and Xiao, [11]; it’s extension to non-flat
curves is announced there, but a full proof can be found in forthcoming work [8].
Theorem 2.2. Suppose that P is as above. Then
k sup Bk (f, g)k1 .P kf k2 kgk2.

The key ingredient in proving this theorem is obtaining so-called “scale-type” decay. Some notation: with Ψ a smooth approximation of the indicator function of an
annulus, define via the Fourier transform

The following is the key proposition; it first appeared essentially as in [12, Theorem
2], see also [11, Propositions 3,4].

Proposition 2.3. The following estimate holds for any |p| . 1
kBk (fk+m , g2k+m+p )k1 .P 2−ǫm kf k2 kgk2.
With these preliminaries in mind, we turn to the proof.
3. Proof of Proposition 1.5
Proposition 1.5 will follow directly from the following proposition.
Proposition 3.1. Suppose A ⊂ [0, 1] has |A| = δ, and k ≥ l ≫ log(δ −1 ) is sufficiently
large. Then there exists an absolute constant 1 ≫ c0 > 0 so that if the following upper
bound holds,

Before turning to the proof, we will make use of the following splitting. Set kδ :=
k +C log δ −1 and lδ := l−C log δ −1 , and assume that we are interested in decomposing
Br (f, g)
for some l ≤ r ≤ k. We split
f = fL + fM + fH ,
where

and

fL := fˆ · φclδ and fc

g = gL + gM + gH ,

where

gbL := ĝ · φ

2lδ and g
H := ĝ · (1 − φ2kδ ),

Furthermore, for ease of presentation, we will drop all terms which contribute . δ C
as negligible.
With this in mind, we turn to the proof.
Proof of Proposition 3.1. Suppose that (3.2) holds. Then, with B := [0, 1] r A we
have the following lower bound, provided that l ≫ log(δ −1 ) is sufficiently large:
Z
c0

For each f, g, we decompose
Br (f, g) = Br (fL , gL )
+ Br (fL , gM + gH ) + Br (fM , g)
+ Br (fH , gL + gM ) + Br (fH , gH ).
For l ≤ r ≤ k, Br (fL , gL ) = fL · gL , up to pointwise errors of δ C ; by Lemma 2.1
and trivial geometric considerations, taking into account the large size of l ≫δ 1, we
deduce that
Z
X
sup |Br ((1C )L , (1C ′ )L )| ≤ δ − cδ 3 ,
C,C ′ ∈{A,B}2 r{A,A}

A l≤r≤k

where c is essentially given by Lemma 2.1. We also observe that
Br (fL , gM + gH ) = fL · MgM ,
again up to pointwise errors on the order of δ C on [0, 1]; here, M denotes an appropriate maximal function, pointwise bounded by the Hardy-Littlewood maximal
function. Again using the large size of l, we have that (1B )M = −(1A )M up to errors
which have L1 norm . δ C when restricted to [0, 1], by Cauchy-Schwartz. Next,
Br (fH , gL + gM ) = 2−ǫ(k−r) · δ C · Πr,k (fH , gL + gM ),
for some paraproduct Πr,k , where kΠr,k kL2 ×L2 →L1 ≤ Ck−r ≤ C for all r, k and some
absolute C, see [12]. Thus
Z
sup |Br (fH , gL + gM )| ≪ δ C .
A l≤r≤k

It remains to analyze Br (fH , gH ). If we express
X
Br (fH , gH ) =
Br (fk+m , g2k+n )+
m,n≫log(δ−1 ),|m−n|.1

X

Br (fk+m , g2k+n ),

m,n≫log(δ−1 ),|m−n|≫1

then the second term is a sum of rapidly decaying paraproducts the sum of whose L1
norms are O(2−ǫ(k−r) · δ C ), while the first term has L1 norm bounded by 2−ǫ(k−r) · δ C
by Proposition 2.3. In particular, the lower bound (3.3) forces
Z

By pointwise considerations, we may refine this to

which yields the result by Cauchy-Schwartz and Theorem 2.2.
