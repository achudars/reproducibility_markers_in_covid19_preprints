Abstract‚ÄîIn this letter, the secrecy performance in cognitive
radio networks (CRNs) over fluctuating two-ray (FTR) channels,
which is used to model the milimeter wave channel, is investigated
in terms of the secrecy outage probability (SOP). Specifically,
we consider the case where a source (S) transmits confidential
messages to a destination (D), and an eavesdropper wants to
wiretap the information from S to D. In a CRN framework,
we assume that the primary user shares its spectrum with S,
where S adopts the underlay strategy to control its transmit
power without impairing the quality of service of the primary
user. After some mathematical manipulations, an exact analytical
expression for the SOP is derived. In order to get physical and
technical insights into the effect of the channel parameters on
the SOP, we derive an asymptotic formula for the SOP in the
high signal-to-noise ratio region of the S ‚àí D link. We finally
show some selected Monte-Carlo simulation results to validate
the correctness of our derived analytical expressions.
Index Terms‚ÄîCognitive radio networks, fluctuating two-ray

I. I NTRODUCTION
Two major technologies to enhance the spectrum efficiency
are cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and millimeter wave
(mmWave) communications [1]-[4], where the first one allows
the primary users to share the spectrum with secondary users
without impairing the quality of service (QoS) of primary
users in CRNs by using some protection strategies [1], and
another provides large available bandwidth at mmWave frequencies [4]. Among common protection strategies in CRNs,
the underlay scheme is the simplest one, because secondary
users only adjust their transmit power without exceeding a
certain interference threshold at primary users, which is easy
to perform in practical CRNs [2]. To this end, the underlay
scheme has been received an increasing attention [1]-[3].
One major obstacle to realize mmWave communications is
to characterize the mmWave channel, especially the random
fluctuation suffered by the received signal, which has been
properly solved by [5] where the fluctuating two-ray (FTR)
channel model was proposed. In the FTR channel model,

specular waves randomly fluctuate, rather than a constant
amplitude in the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) channel model, which means that the FTR model is a natural
generalization of TWDP model. In fact, the FTR model can
reduce to many traditional fading channels, such as Rician and
Nakagimi-m channels, where the relative parameter settings of
FTR model are shown in the Table I of [5]. Recently, [6], [7]
has extended [5] to a more generalized FTR channel model
allowing any positive value of m.
Physical layer security is a common topic in wireless communications because of the open access [8]-[10]. For example,
the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of point-to-point digital
communications, i.e., the typical three-node Wyner‚Äôs model
in [8] over FTR channels, was investigated in [11]. However,
to best of authors‚Äô knowledge, there is no related work on
physical layer security in CRNs over FTR fading channels,
and the secrecy analysis is an important issue in CRNs [12][14], because the frequency band shared among primary and
secondary users results in a higher interception probability
both in the primary and secondary networks.
To fill this gap, we investigate the physical layer security
in CRNs over FTR channels in terms of the SOP, and derive
the analytical expression for the exact SOP. The asymptotic
SOP (ASOP) has been also proposed with simple functions
to cut down the computation complexity in the high signalto-noise ratio (SNR) region. Moreover, the secrecy diversity
order and secrecy array gain of ASOP are presented to reveal
the physical insights of channel parameters on the security
performance of CRNs.
II. S YSTEM M ODEL
There is a source (S) transmitting signal to a destination
(D) in a secondary network, where a primary user (P ) shares
the spectrum with S. However, an eavesdropper (E) wants to
overhear the information from S to D. hp , hd , and he are the
channel power gains of the S ‚àí P , S ‚àí D, and S ‚àí E links,
respectively. In the underlay scheme, the transmit power (Pt )
of S should be less than a certain threshold (Ith ) to guarantee
the QoS of P , i.e.,

where œÅ = Ith /PM , PM is the maximal transmit power of S,
and I{¬∑} denotes the indicator function, i.e., I{A} is unity
for A true and zero otherwise. It is worth noting that (1)
reveals the main difference from the work in [11] where the
transmitter only uses a fixed transmit power, i.e., PM , for
communications with the legitimate receiver. If Ith ‚Üí ‚àû (or

three-node Wyner‚Äôs model investigated in [11].
We assume that all links follow independent FTR fading.

respectively, where N0 denotes the power of the Gaussian

III. S ECRECY O UTAGE P ROBABILITY
We assume that S only has the instantaneous channel state
information (CSI) of S ‚àí D link, and does not know the
CSI of S ‚àí E link, and therefore, S has no choice but to
transmit signal at a constant rate of confidential information
(Rs ). In this case, perfect security cannot be guaranteed,
because the instantaneous secrecy capacity defined in [8],
Cs = max {log2 (1 + Œ≥d ) ‚àí log2 (1 + Œ≥e ) , 0} , cannot be always greater than the target secrecy rate (Rs ). The SOP is to
capture the secrecy outage performance, the probability that
Rs is greater than the secrecy capacity [8], i.e.,
SOP = Pr{Cs ‚â§ Rs } = Pr {Œ≥d ‚â§ Œª ‚àí 1 + ŒªŒ≥e } ,

(7)

where Œª = 2Rs . By substituting (5) and (6) into (7), the SOP
is written as

to D at a fixed transmit power, i.e., PM , where the SOP in
non-CRNs has been investigated in [11], given by (10) (refer

IV. A SYMPTOTIC A NALYSIS
From (9), we can easily see that SOP ‚âà SOP1 for œÅ ‚Üí
‚àû, and SOP ‚âà SOP2 for œÅ ‚Üí 0. Therefore, one way to
approximate the SOP is
(
SOP1 |œÅ‚Üí‚àû , if œÅ ‚â´ 0;
SOP ‚âà
(17)
SOP2 |œÅ=0 ,
if œÅ ‚Üí 0,
where SOP2 |œÅ=0 is actually the proposed SOP by [13] without
taking the maximal transmit power constraint at the transmitter
into account, and SOP1 |œÅ‚Üí‚àû is the SOP in non-CRNs, i.e.,
the SOP investigated in [11].
To get the secrecy diversity order and secrecy array gain
for the SOP, we analyze the ASOP when ¬µd ‚Üí ‚àû and ¬µe
remains constant. The asymptotic CDF of hd for 2œÉd2 ‚â´ 0 is
given by (32) in [5]

The expression for ASOP shows that the secrecy diversity
order is always unity2, and the ASOP is a linear function with
respect to 2œÉd2 in the dB scale, where the secrecy diversity
order and array gain are the slope and intercept on the abscissa
axis, respectively. It is also worth noting that the secrecy
array gain (G) depends only on the average of the channel
power gain of the wiretap channel. Moreover, by using the
relationship between 2œÉd2 and ¬µd , i.e., ¬µd = 2œÉd2 (1 + Kd ), we
can also obtain the ASOP in terms of ¬µd .
V. N UMERICAL R ESULTS
In calculation of the infinite summation terms in the PDF
and CDF of ht (t ‚àà {d, e, p}), we truncate the infinite terms
into finite terms, where the corresponding truncated error
analysis has been evaluated in [6], [11]. In the analytical
results, we truncate the first 80 summation terms from infinite
terms, which gives us a very high precision. In the MonteCarlo simulation, 107 channel state realizations are generated
to derive the numerical results.
Fig. 1 plots the SOP versus Ith , where we can easily observe
a decreasing trend in SOP with increasing Ith . When Ith is
sufficiently large, the SOP is roughly unchanged, due to the
maximal transmit power constraint at S, and actually, the SOP
can be approximated by SOP1 with œÅ ‚Üí ‚àû, because the
cognitive radio (CR) scenario becomes the non-CR scenario
where the transmitter always uses its maximal transmit power.
It is obvious that the SOP becomes better as PM increases, due
to the improved transmit power constraint. There is a narrow
gap for a larger PM between the SOP and SOP2 |œÅ=0 , because
a larger PM means a higher probability of Pt = Ith /hp , which
is exactly the power control in CRNs proposed by [13] where
the maximal transmit power constraint is not considered.
In Fig. 2, we can see that the SOP becomes better as ¬µe
decreases, due to the worse wiretap channel. The decreasing
trend in SOP with respect to ¬µd is shown in Figs. 2-3, where
we can also see that the SOP is improved with decreasing Rs
(or increasing K), which can be explained by the fact that
2 This unit diversity order conclusion does not include the Nakagami-m
fading, a limit special case of FTR fading [5], because some mathematical
properties will change if that limit condition happens.

VI. C ONCLUSION
The analytical expression for the SOP was derived, which
can be divided into two parts, i.e., SOP1 and SOP2 . When
œÅ = 0, our SOP becomes the SOP proposed by [13] without
taking the maximal transmit power constraint into account.

For œÅ ‚Üí ‚àû, our SOP is reduced to the SOP in non-CRNs
investigated in [11] where the impact of the primary network
vanishes. when the SNR of S ‚àí D link is sufficiently large,
the ASOP shows that the secrecy diversity order is always
unity regardless of any parameter setting. From the numerical
results, we can conclude that the increase in œÅ (or ¬µd , Kd ) and
decrease in ¬µe (or Rs ) will lead to a lower SOP. However, due
to the fact that the channel state is uncontrollable, the valid
way for the transmitter to improve the SOP is to increase œÅ
or decrease Rs .
