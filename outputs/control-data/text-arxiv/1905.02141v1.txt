MATCHING NUMBERS AND THE REGULARITY OF THE REES
ALGEBRA OF AN EDGE IDEAL
JÜRGEN HERZOG AND TAKAYUKI HIBI
Abstract. The regularity of the Rees ring of the edge ideal of a finite simple
graph is studied. We show that the matching number is a lower and matching
number +1 is an upper bound of the regularity, if the Rees algebra is normal. In
general the induced matching number is a lower bound for the regularity, which
can be shown by applying the squarefree divisor complex.

Introduction
In the study of powers of monomial ideals, the Rees algebra plays an important
role. In the present paper we focus on the Rees algebra of the edge ideal of a finite
simple graph.
Let K be a field and S = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be the polynomial ring over K in the
variables x1 , . . . , xn . Furthermore, let G be a simple graph on the vertex set V (G) =
[n] and edge set E(G). The edge ideal I = I(G) of G is the monomial ideal in S
generated by the monomials xi xj with {i, j} ∈ E(G), and the edge ring K[G]
Lis thes
K-algebra generated by the monomials xi xj ∈ I. The Rees algebra R(I) = s≥0 I
of I may be viewed as the edge ring of the graph G∗ with V (G∗ ) = [n + 1] and
E(G∗ ) = E(G) ∪ {{i, n + 1} : i ∈ V (G)}. We are interested in bounding the
regularity of R(I), because this provides information about the regularity of the
powers of I. In our situation, computing regularity of R(I) amounts to compute
the regularity of the edge ring of graphs of the form G∗ . This class of algebras
are particular classes of toric rings. To our knowledge, there are essentially two
methods available to compute the regularity of a toric ring A. The first method,
which can always be applied, is to compute the multigraded Betti numbers of A by
using the squarefree divisor complex (see [2, Proposition 1.1] and [4, Theorem 3.28]).
In concrete cases, as discussed in Section 1, this allows to give lower bounds for the
regularity, but in general it is hard to use. The second method can be applied, if A
is Cohen–Macaulay, in which case one needs to compute the a-invariant of A. If in
addition, A is normal, then following Danilov and Stanley [1, Theorem 6.3.5], the
canonical module can computed which in particular gives us the a-invariant of A.
Let A be a toric ring generated by monomials in S. A K-subalgebra B of A is
called a combinatorial pure subalgebra of A if there exists a subset T ⊂ [n] such
that B = A ∩ K[xi : i ∈ T ]. In Section 1 we recall squarefree divisor complexes
and use them to prove that if B ⊂ A is a combinatorial pure subring of A, then

βi,j (B) ≤ βi,j (A) for all i and j. Here the βi,j (M) denote the graded Betti numbers
of a graded module M. This result implies in particular that if I is a monomial ideal
generated in a single degree, then reg R(I) ≥ reg F (I), where F (I) is the fiber cone
of I. We also use squarefree divisor complexes to give lower bounds of the regularity
of the Rees algebra of I(G), when G is a disjoint union of edges. These results will
be used in the next section.
Now, we devote Section 2 to finding an upper bound and a lower bound of the
regularity of the Rees algebra R(I(G)) of the edge ideal I(G) of a finite simple graph
G in terms of the matching number of G and the induced matching number of G.
Recall that a matching of G is a subset M ⊂ E(G) such that e ∩ e′ = ∅ for all e
and e′ belonging to M with e 6= e′ . A matching M of G is called perfect if, for each
i ∈ [n], there is e ∈ M with i ∈ e. An induced matching of G is a matching M of G
such that if e and e′ belong to M with e 6= e′ , then there is no edge f ∈ E(G) with
e ∩ f 6= ∅ and e′ ∩ f 6= ∅. The maximal of matchings of G is called the matching
number of G and is denoted by mat(G). The induced matching number of G, denoted
by indmat(G), is the maximal cardinality of induced matchings of G.
It is known [5, Corollary 2.3] that K[G] is normal if and only if each connected
component G′ of G satisfies the odd cycle condition, which says that if C and C ′ are
odd cycles of G′ with V (C) ∩ V (C ′ ) = ∅, then there are i ∈ V (C) and j ∈ V (C ′ )
with {i, j} ∈ E(G′ ). In particular, if G is bipartite, then K[G] is normal. It is shown
[3, Theorem 4.2] that, when G is bipartite, one has reg R(I(G)) = mat(G).
Our main result (Theorem 2.2) says that, if R(I(G)) is normal, then
mat(G) ≤ reg R(I(G)) ≤ mat(G) + 1.
Furthermore, if G has a perfect matching, then reg R(I(G)) = mat(G). Our proof
heavily depends on the theory of normal edge polytopes created in [5] as well as on
the result [6, Theorem 3.3] which says that if G′ is a subgraph of G and if each of
K[G′ ] and K[G] is normal, then one has reg K[G′ ] ≤ reg K[G]. Even though K[G]
is normal, the above upper bound may not be satisfied (Remarks 1.6).
On the other hand, it follows from Proposition 1.2 that, for any finite simple
graph G, one has indmat(G) ≤ reg R(I(G)). We, however, very much believe that
the inequality mat(G) ≤ reg R(I(G)) is valid for any finite simple graph G.
1. Combinatorial pure subrings and regularity
Let K be a field and A = K[u1 , . . . , um] ⊂ S = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be the K-algebra
minimally generated by the monomials ui = xai in the polynomial ring S. Here for
a = (a1 , . . . , an ) we denote by xa the monomial x1a1 xa22 · · · xann .
The K-algebra A has a K-basis consisting of monomials xa . The set of exponents
a appearing as exponents of the basis elements of A together with addition form a
positive affine semigroup H ⊂ Nn which is generated by a1 , . . . , an .
Given an element a ∈ H, we define the simplicial complex
∆a (A) = {F ⊂ [n] : uF divides xa in A}.
where uF =

The simplicial complex ∆a (A) is called the squarefree divisor complex of H (or of
A) with respect to a.
We recall the following theorem from [2, Proposition 1.1] (see also [4, Theorem 3.28])
Theorem 1.1. For the multigraded Betti numbers of A one has
e i−1 (∆a ; K).
βi,a (A) = dimK H

e i (Γ; K) denotes the ith reduced simplicial homology of a simplicial complex Γ.
Here H

We demonstrate this theorem by a simple example. Let A = K[x21 , x1 x2 , x22 ] ⊂
K[x1 , x2 ]. Then u1 = x21 , u2 = x1 x2 and u3 = x22 and H ⊂ Z2 is generated by (2, 0),
(1, 1) and (0, 2). We want to compute β1,(2,2) (A). Squarefree divisors of x21 x22 are
u1 u3 and u2 . Therefore, the facets of ∆(2,2) are {1, 3} and {2}. Thus, ∆(2,2) has
e 0 (∆(2,2) ; K) = 1. For the total standard
two connected components and so dimK H
grading this means that β1,2 = 1. Indeed the Betti diagram of A is the following:

Proposition 1.2. Let B ⊂ A a combinatorial pure subring of the toric K-algebra
A. Then βi,a (B) = βi,a (A) for all a with xa ∈ B.
Proof. Let A = K[u1 , . . . , um ] be minimally generated by the monomials u1 , . . . , um
in K[x1 , . . . , xn ], and assume that B = A ∩ K[xi : i ∈ T ] for some subset T ⊂ [n].
We may further assume that supp(ui ) ⊂ T for i ≤ r and supp(ui ) 6⊂ T for i > r.
Then B
Q = K[u1 , . . . , ur ].a We claim that ∆a (B) = ∆a (A).a Indeed, let F ∈ ∆a (B).
Then i∈F ui divides x in B. Then it also divides
Q x in A. This shows that
∆a (B) ⊂ ∆a (A). Conversely, let F ∈ ∆a (A). Then i∈F ui divides xa in A.
Q Since
a
supp(x ) ∈ T , it follows that all ui with i ∈ F belong to B, and since i∈F ui

divides xa in A, we have xa = ( i∈F ui ) j=1,...,m uj j for some integers aj ≥ 0.
Since supp(xa ) ⊂ T , the same holds true for all uj with aj > 0. It follows that

j=1,...,m uj ∈ B, and hence F ∈ ∆a (B).
Corollary 1.3. Let A be a toric ring with all generators of same degree d, and let
B be a combinatorial pure subring. Then A and B are naturally standard graded,
and we have βi,j (B) ≤ βi,j (A) for all i and j.

Corollary 1.4. Let G be a finite simple graph and I = I(G) its edge ideal. Then
βi,j (R(I)) ≥ βi,j (K[G]) for all i and j. In particular, reg(R(I)) ≥ reg(K[G]).
Proof. The Rees ring R(I) is isomorphic to K[G∗ ]. Since K[G] is a combinatorial
pure subring of K[G∗ ], the assertion follows from Corollary 1.3.

In the next two proposition we consider the Rees algebra of a special graph which
plays a role in the next section.
Proposition 1.5. Let G be the graph consisting of m disjoint edges, and let I = I(G)
be the edge ideal of G. Then reg R(I) = 0 if m = 1 and reg R(I) ≥ m if m > 1.
Proof. If m = 1, then E(G) = {1, 2} and E(G∗ ) = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}}, and hence
G∗ is a 3-cycle. Hence R(I) which is isomorphic to K[G∗ ] is a polynomial ring, since
the genertors of K[G∗ ] are algebraically independent.
Now let m > 1, and for i = 1, . . . , m let ei = {2i − 1, 2i} be the edges of G. Then
G∗ has the additional edges fi = {i, 2m+1} (i = 1, . . . , 2m). Let the ui = x2i−1 x2i be
the monomial generators of K[G∗ ] corresponding to the edges ei and the vi = xi x2m+1
the generators ofQK[G∗ ] corresponding to the edges fi . In K[G∗ ] we consider the
element xa = u1 i=3,...,2m vi = x1 x2 . . . x2m x2m−2
m+1 , and claim that
e m−2 (∆a ) 6= 0.
dimK H

Thus, by Theorem 1.1 the claim implies that βm−1,a (R(I)) 6= 0. Since |a| = 2(2m −
1), it follows that βm−1,2m−1 (R(I)) ≥ 1, and this implies that reg(R(I)) ≥ m.
Proof of the claim: we first notice that ∆a has the facets
Fi = {ui , v1 , . . . , v2m } \ {v2i−1 , v2i } for i = 1, . . . , m.
where the vertices Q
of ∆a are identified with the monomials ui and vj .
Indeed, since ui j=1,...,2m vj = xa for i = 1, . . . , m it follows that F1 , . . . , Fm are
j6=2i−1,2i
facets of ∆a .
In order to prove that these are all the facets of ∆a , we show that if F is a face
of ∆a , then F ⊂ Fi for some i. Suppose {ei , ej } ⊂ F for some i 6= j. By symmetry
we may assume that {e1 , e2 } ⊂ F . Then xa /x1 x2 x3 x4 = x5 · · · x2m x2m−2
m+1 ∈ A which
2m−2
is impossible because x5 · · · x2m xm+1 must contain 2m − 2 factor of the fj . Next
suppose that F ∩ {e1 , . . . , em } = ∅. If there exists i such that F ∩ {f2i−1 , f2i } = ∅,
then F ⊂ Fi . Otherwise, F ∩ {f2i−1 , f2i } =
6 ∅ for all i, and by symmetry we
may assume that f2i−1 ∈ F for i = 1, . . . , m. Since uF divides xa it follows that
|F | ≤ 2m − 1. By symmetry
we may assume that f2 and f4 do not belong to F .
Q
a
F
Then x /u = x2 x4 i f2i 6∈F x2i 6∈ A. Hence, F 6∈ ∆a . It remains to consider the
case that F ∩ {e1 , . . . , em } = {ei } for some i. By symmetry we may assume that
i = 1. Suppose that f1 ∈ F . Then u1 f1 = x21 x2 xm+1 divides xa , a contradiction.
Thus f1 6∈ F . Similarly, f2 6∈ F . This shows that F ⊂ F1 .
Next we notice that geometric realization |∆a | of ∆a is homotopic to the geometric
realization of the simplicial complex Γ whose facets are
Gi = {f1 , f3 , . . . , f2m−1 } \ {f2i−1 },
4

i = 1, . . . , m.

We choose the standard geometric realization by identifying the vertices
e1 , . . . , em , f1 , . . . , f2m
of ∆a with the standard unit vectors in R3m .
Indeed, the homotopy is given by the affine maps ϕt induced by ei 7→ e′i =
tei + (1 − t)f1 if i > 1 and e1 7→ e′1 = te1 + (t − 1)f3 . Moreover, fi 7→ fi′ = fi if i is
odd and fi 7→ fi′ = tfi + (1 − t)fi−1 if i is even. Here 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. We have ϕ1 = id
and |Γ| = ϕ0 (|∆a |), as desired.
e m−2 (∆a ). Observe
e m−2 (Γ) ∼
Now since |Γ| is homotopic to |∆a |, we see that H
=H
e m−2 (Γ) 6= 0. This concludes
that |Γ| is homotopic to an (m − 2)-sphere, so that H
the proof of the proposition.

Remarks 1.6. Let G be the sum of the graphs G1 and G2 . Assume that G has
no isolated vertices and G1 or G2 has at least 2 edges. Considering several examples we come up with the following question: Is it true that reg R(I(G1 + G2 )) =
reg R(I(G1 )) + reg R(I(G2 ))?
If this question has a positive answer, then Proposition 1.5 is just a very special
case of this statement. Of course it is also a simple consequence of the theorem
of Cid-Ruiz [3]. However, in order to keep this paper as self-contained as possible and also to demonstrate the use of squarefree divisor complexes, we included
Proposition 1.5 to this paper.
With CoCoA we considered the case that G is the sum of two 3-cycles, and found
reg R(I(G)) = 4, as expected. In the next section we show that reg R(I(G)) ≤
mat(G) + 1 if R(IG)) is normal. In our example with the two 3-cycles, R(I(G)) is
not normal and mat(G) = 2. Therefore, the inequality reg R(I(G)) ≤ mat(G) + 1
is in general not valid if reg R(I(G)) is not normal.
If our question has a positive answer, then one has reg R(I(G)) = 2m if G is the
sum of m 3-cycles. On the other hand, for this graph, mat(G) = m. This then gives
a family of graphs for which reg R(I(G)) − mat(G) can be any positive integer.
2. Bounds for the regularity of the Rees algebra of an edge ideal
Let, as before, G be a finite simple graph on the vertex V (G) = [n] and S =
K[x1 , . . . , xn ] the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K. Let PG ⊂ Rn be
the edge polytope of G which is the convex hull of { ei + ej : {i, j} ∈ E(G) }, where
ei is the ith unit coordinate vector of Rn . Let APG denote the Ehrhart ring of G,
which is the toric ring in the n + 1 variables x1 , . . . , xn , t whose K-basis consists of
those monomials xa11 . . . xa11 tq , where 1 ≤ q ∈ Z, with (a1 , . . . , an ) ∈ qPG ∩ Zn≥0 . We
refer the reader to [5] for basic materials and fundamental results on edge polytopes
and their Ehrhart rings. The Ehrhart ring APG is normal and its canonical module
is spanned by those monomials xa11 . . . xa11 tq with (a1 , . . . , an ) ∈ q(PG \ ∂PG ) ∩ Zn≥0 .
The edge ring K[G] is normal if and only if APG is standard grading, i.e., APG is
generated by those monomials xa11 . . . xa11 t with (a1 , . . . , an ) ∈ PG ∩Zn≥0 as an algebra
over K. Thus in particular K[G] is normal if and only if K[G] is isomorphic to APG .
Furthermore, it is shown [5, Corollary 2.3] that K[G] is normal if and only if each
connected component G′ of G satisfies the odd cycle condition, that is, if C and
5

C ′ are odd cycles of G′ with V (C) ∩ V (C ′ ) = ∅, then there exist i ∈ V (C) and
j ∈ V (C ′ ) with {i, j} ∈ E(G′ ). In particular, if G is bipartite, then K[G] is normal.
We say that a finite subset L ⊂ E(G) is an edge cover of G if ∪e∈L = [n]. Let
µ(G) denote the minimal cardinality of edge covers of G.
Lemma 2.1. Let G be a finite simple graph on V (G) = [n]. Then
µ(G) + mat(G) = n.
Proof. Let L ⊂ E(G) be an edge cover with |L| = µ(G) and M ′ a matching of G
which is maximal among those matchings M with M ⊂ L. Then, for each edge
e ∈ L \ M, there is f ∈ M with e ∩ f 6= ∅. Hence 2|M| + (µ(G) − |M|) = n. Thus
mat(G) ≥ |M| = n − µ(G). Hence µ(G) ≥ n − mat(G). However, clearly, one has
µ(G) ≤ n − mat(G). Thus µ(G) = n − mat(G), as desired.

In order to achieve the proof of Theorem 2.2, the information of the facets of edge
polytopes is indispensable. Let G be a connected non-bipartite graph on V (G) = [n].
We say that i ∈ [n] is regular ([5, p. 414]) if each connected component of the induced
subgraph G[n]\{i} is non-bipartite. When i ∈ [n] is regular, the hyperplane Hi of Rn
defined by the equation zi = 0 is a supporting hyperplane of PG and Hi ∩ PG is a
facet of PG ([5, Theorem 1.7]). A nonempty subset T ⊂ [n] is called independent if
{i, j} 6∈ E(G) for i and j belonging to T with i 6= j. When T is independent, we write
NG (T ) ⊂ [n] for the set of those vertices i ∈ [n] for which there is an edge e ∈ E(G)
with i ∈ e and e ∩ T 6= ∅. When T is independent, we write T ♯ for the bipartite
graph on the vertex set T ∪ NG (T ) whose edges are those {i, j} ∈ E(G) with i ∈ T
and j ∈ NG (T ). When T is independent, we say that T is fundamental ([5, p. 415])
if (i) T ♯ is connected and (ii) either T ∪ NG (T ) = [n] or each connected component
of the induced subgraph G[n]\(T ∪NG (T )) is non-bipartite.
When
P
P T is fundamental, the
n
hyperplane HT of R defined by the equation i∈T zi = j∈NG (T ) zj is a supporting
hyperplane of PG and HT ∩ PG is a facet of PG ([5, Theorem 1.7]).
We now come to the main result of the present paper. It is known [3, Theorem
4.2] that, when G is bipartite, one has reg R(I(G)) = mat(G).
Theorem 2.2. (a) Let G be a finite simple graph with G1 , . . . , Gc its connected
components. Then the Rees algebra R(I(G)) = K[G∗ ] is normal if and only if each
K[Gi ] is normal and at most one of G1 , . . . , Gc is non-bipartite.
(b) Let |E(G)| ≥ 2. Suppose that R(I(G)) is normal. Then
mat(G) ≤ reg R(I(G)) ≤ mat(G) + 1.
Proof. (a) The “If” part is clear. We show now the “Only If” part. If, say, G1 fails to
satisfy the odd cycle condition, then G∗ also fails to satisfy the odd cycle condition.
If, say, G1 and G2 are non-bipartite and if Ci is an odd cycle of Gi for i ∈ {1, 2},
then, even though G∗ is connected, there is no edge e ∈ E(G∗ ) with e ∩ V (Ci ) 6= ∅
for i ∈ {1, 2}, as desired.
(b) We first prove the lower bound. In case mat(G) = 1, the graph G is a star
graph which by assumption has at least 2 edges. Then R(I(G)) is not polynomial
and therefore reg R(I(G)) ≥ 1 = mat(G).
6

Now let m = mat(G) and assume that m ≥ 2 and {{i1 , j1 }, . . . , {im , jm }} a
matching of G. Write H for the subgraph of G with E(H) = {{i1 , j1 }, . . . , {im , jm }}.
Since R(I(H)) = K[H ∗ ] is normal with reg R(I(H)) = m (Proposition 1.5) and since
H ∗ is a subgraph of G∗ , it follows from [6, Theorem 3.3] that
mat(G) = reg R(I(H)) ≤ reg R(I(G)).
We now prove the upper bound. The highlight of the proof is to estimate the
positive integer
q0 = min{ q ≥ 1 : q(PG∗ \ ∂PG∗ ) ∩ Zn+1 6= ∅ }.
(Case I) Suppose that G is connected and non-bipartite. Each vertex i ∈ [n + 1]
of PG∗ is regular. It then follows from [5, Theorem 1.7] that, if (a1 , . . . , an , an+1 )
belongs to q(PG∗ \ ∂PG∗ ) ∩ Zn+1 , then each ai > 0. By using Lemma 2.1 one has
q0 ≥ µ(G) = (n + 1) − mat(G∗ ) ≥ (n + 1) − (mat(G) + 1).
Since dim PG∗ = n, it follows that
reg R(I(G)) = (n + 1) − q0 ≤ mat(G) + 1,
as desired.
(Case II) Suppose that G is disconnected and non-bipartite. Let G1 , . . . Gc be
the connected components of G, where G1 is non-bipartite and where each of
G2 , . . . , Gc is bipartite. Let V (Gi ) = Vi ∪ Vi′ be the decomposition of V (Gi ). Let
(a1 , . . . , an , an+1 ) belong to q(PG∗ \ ∂PG∗ ) ∩ Zn+1 . Since each i ∈ [n] is regular,
one has ai > 0 for each i ∈ [n]. Since T = V2 ∪ · · · ∪ Vc is fundamental with
NG (T ) = V2′ ∪ · · · ∪ Vc′ ∪ {n + 1}, it follows that an+1 > 0. Hence, as in (Case I), one
has reg R(I(G)) ≤ mat(G) + 1, as required.

In the proof of (b) of Theorem 2.2, one has mat(G∗ ) = mat(G) if and only if G
has a perfect matching. As a result,
Corollary 2.3. If G has a perfect matching and if R(I(G)) is normal, then
reg R(I(G)) = mat(G).
The converse of Corollary 2.3 is false. In fact,
Example 2.4. Let G be a finite simple connected non-bipartite graph on [6] whose
edges are
{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {1, 4}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {2, 6}.
Even though G has no perfect matching, one has reg R(I(G)) = mat(G) = 2. The
lattice points (a1 , . . . , a7 ) belonging to 4PG∗ ∩ Z7 with each ai > 0 are
(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1).
Since T = {1, 3, 5, 6} is fundamental, neither of these lattice points cannot belong
to 4(PG∗ \ ∂PG∗ ). Thus q0 ≥ 5.
7

It would, of course, be of interest to characterize finite simple graphs G with
reg R(I(G)) = mat(G). On the other hand, if G is a 5-cycle, then R(I(G)) is
normal, reg R(I(G)) = 3 and mat(G) = 2.
When K[G] is non-normal, instead of [6, Theorem 3.3], we can enjoy the merit of
combinatorial pure subrings (Corollary 1.3).
Proposition 2.5. Let G be an arbitrary finite simple graph. Then one has
indmat(G) ≤ reg R(I(G)).
We, however, believe that the lower bound inequality mat(G) ≤ reg R(I(G)) is
valid for any finite simple graph G.
