SHARPENING THE TRIANGLE INEQUALITY: ENVELOPES
BETWEEN L2 AND Lp SPACES
PAATA IVANISVILI AND CONNOR MOONEY
Abstract. Motivated by the inequality kf + gk22 ≤ kf k22 + 2kf gk1 + kgk22 ,
Carbery (2006) raised the question what is the “right” analogue of this estimate
in Lp for p 6= 2. Carlen, Frank, Ivanisvili and Lieb (2018) recently obtained
an Lp version of this inequality by providing upper bounds for kf + gkpp in
p/2

terms of the quantities kf kpp , kgkpp and kf gkp/2 when p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞), and
lower bounds when p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ (1, 2), thereby proving (and improving) the
suggested possible inequalities of Carbery. We continue investigation in this
direction by refining the estimates of Carlen, Frank, Ivanisvili and Lieb. We
obtain upper bounds for kf + gkpp also when p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ (1, 2) and lower
bounds when p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞). For p ∈ [1, 2] we extend our upper bounds to
any finite number of functions. In addition, we show that all our upper and
lower bounds of kf + gkpp for p ∈ R, p 6= 0, are the best possible in terms of
p/2

the quantities kf kpp , kgkpp and kf gkp/2 , and we characterize the equality cases.

1. Introduction
For any real-valued functions f, g ∈ Lp on an arbitrary measure space, and any
p ≥ 1, one has the inequality

kf + gkpp ≤ 2p−1 kf kpp + kgkpp .
(1)

The estimate (1) follows from the fact that the map x 7→ |x|p is convex. If f = g
in (1) then the constant 2p−1 is sharp and the inequality becomes equality. On the
other hand, if f and g have disjoint supports then the constant 2p−1 is not needed.
We remark that the estimate (1) reflects the convexity of the unit ball in Lp , which
is equivalent to the usual Lp triangle (Minkowski) inequality (see e.g. [3]).
In [2], Carbery asked
what conditions onPthe sequence of functions {fj } ⊂
P under
Lp the inequality
kfj kpp < ∞ would imply
fj ∈ Lp . If we try to adapt
the inequality (1) to say n number of functions f1 , f2 , . . . , fn instead of two, then
the constant 2p−1 should be replaced by np−1 which grows with n. To remove
dependence on n Carbery suggested several extensions of inequality (1) which were
motivated by the estimate kf + gk22 ≤ kf k22 + 2kf gk1 + kgk22. All of them involve the
p/2
extra parameter kf gkp/2 , which measures the “overlap” between the functions, and
the strongest one in case of two functions he could prove only for indicator functions
of sets. Recently a sharpened form of the triangle inequality was obtained [3] which
implied the proposed estimates of Carbery’s. Namely, take any p ∈ R \ {0}, and

holds true if p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞), and the inequality reverses if p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ (1, 2),
where in the latter case we assume that f, g are positive almost everywhere. Since
by Cauchy–Schwarz Γp ∈ [0, 1] for all p ∈ R \ {0} we see that (2) improves on the
trivial bound (1).
In this paper we continue investigation in this direction and we address the
following questions:
1. Can one further sharpen the right hand side of the estimate (2) if we are
allowed to use only the quantities kf kp , kgkp , kf gkp/2?
2. What is the optimal upper bound on kf + gkpp in terms of the quantities
kf kp , kgkp , kf gkp/2 , also when p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ (1, 2)? The same question
about lower bounds on kf + gkpp , also when p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞).
3. Can one extend these estimates to many functions, more than 2?
We will give complete answers to Questions 1 and 2, and we will provide
P an answer

2. Main results
Let (X, A, µ) be an arbitrary measure space. In what follows we consider functions f, g on X that are measurable and nonnegative. Given p ∈ R \ {0} we will
be always assuming that kf kpp , kgkpp < ∞. When p < 0 we allow f, g to take the
value +∞, where we understand f p , g p = 0.

space we have

Remark 2.2. The right hand side of (3) is the best possible in the following sense:
consider the measure space ([0, 1], B, dx). Pick any nonnegative numbers x, y and z
√
such that 0 ≤ z ≤ xy. Then, for any p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞) the supremum of the left
p/2
hand side of (3) over all nonnegative f, g with fixed kf kpp = x, kgkpp = y, kf gkp/2 = z
coincides with the right hand side of (3). Similarly, for any p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ [1, 2] the
infimum of the left hand side of (3) over all such f, g coincides with the right hand
side of (3). We justify this remark in Section 3.

Remark 2.2 implies in particular that Theorem 2.1 refines the estimate (2). As
a consequence we have the following peculiar estimate:
Corollary 2.3. For any p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞), and any number Γ ∈ [0, 1] we have

The above inequality is Theorem 1.3 from [3], with α := a+b
We should mention that estimate (5) does not follow solely from Theorem 2.1.
It follows from the fact that both inequalities (3) and (2) hold true and the fact
that (3) is sharp in a sense of Remark 2.2. On the other hand, by comparing the
right hand sides of (3) and (2) one arrives at (5) which coincides with Theorem 1.3
in [3] where it is also proved that (5) implies (2).

Remark 2.4. If we let q := 1/p and x = 1 − Γ2 , then inequality (4) can also be
written as the following “two-point inequality:”

For each fixed q ≥ 2, inequality (6) improves inequality (1.7) from [1] (the Gross
two-point inequality) for X = 1 and Y close to 0, using the notation in [1].

following three conditions holds: f = g on {f g > 0}, g = λf on {f > 0} for some
λ ≥ 1, or f = λg on {g > 0} for some λ ≥ 1.

λ ≤ 1.
Exactly the same remark as before applies to Theorem 2.5; that is, the right hand
sides of (7) and (8) are the best possible. Together, Theorems 2.1 and 2.5, along
with the remarks about optimality, answer Questions 1 and 2.
Finally, we state a partial answer to Question 3 in the case p > 0.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 3 we reduce the proofs of
Theorems 2.1 and 2.5, as well as the remarks about their optimality, to computing
the concave and convex envelopes of a certain function defined on the boundary of
a convex cone in R3 . In Section 4 we compute these envelopes. Finally, in Section
5 we prove Corollary 2.6 using an observation about the proof of Theorem 2.5.
3. Reductions
In this section we reduce Theorems 2.1 and 2.5 to computing explicitly the convex
and concave envelopes of a certain function defined on the boundary of a convex
cone in R3 . Let
√
Ω := {x, y ≥ 0, 0 ≤ z ≤ xy}
be the convex cone in R3 whose vertical cross-sections Ω ∩ {x + y = c > 0} are
half-ellipses. For p ∈ R\{0} define ϕp on ∂Ω by
(
x + y, p > 0
√
1/p
1/p p
ϕp (x, y, xy) = (x + y ) , x, y > 0, ϕp (x, y, 0) =
0, p < 0.
Let f and g be nonnegative functions on an arbitrary measure space (X, A, µ)
p/2
with kf kpp , kgkpp < ∞. Note that the triple (kf kpp , kgkpp , kf gkp/2 ) ∈ Ω by the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. By the equality case, if the triple is in ∂Ω we have
p/2
kf +gkpp = ϕp (kf kpp , kgkpp , kf gkp/2 ). Our approach is based on the following lemma:
Lemma 3.1. Let p ∈ R\{0}, and assume that H ∈ C(Ω) is a concave, onehomogeneous function on Ω with H|∂Ω = ϕp . Then

kf + gkpp ≤ H kf kpp , kgkpp , kf gkp/2 .
If H is convex, the inequality reverses.

Lemma 3.1 reduces our problem to computing the concave and convex envelopes
of ϕp on Ω. By concave envelope we mean the infimum of linear functions on Ω
that are greater than ϕp on ∂Ω, and by convex envelope the supremum of linear
functions on Ω that are smaller than ϕp on ∂Ω. Let H p denote the concave envelope,
and H p the convex envelope. For (x, y, z) ∈ Ω, define
nx y o
2z

w(x, y, z) :=

where we take w = 0 at the origin and v = 1 on Ω ∩ {z = 0}. Define the onehomogeneous functions Fp , Gp on Ω by

Gp (x, y, z) :=

Proposition 3.2. The concave and convex envelopes H p , H p of ϕp in Ω are in
C(Ω) and are given explicitly by the formulae
(
Fp , p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞),
Hp =
Gp , p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ (1, 2)

and

Hp =

(

Fp ,
Gp ,

p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ (1, 2),
p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞).

We delay the proof of Proposition 3.2 to Section 4, and immediately note that
Theorems 2.1 and 2.5 follow quickly:
Proof of Theorems 2.1 and 2.5: To prove the inequalities, just apply Lemma
3.1 to the functions H p and H p . To check the equality cases, observe that in the
proof of Lemma 3.1, we have equality in Jensen provided {(f p , g p , (f g)p/2 )} lie in
a set where H is linear.
Since Fp is linear when restricted to the hyperplanes {z = k(x + y)} ∩ Ω (which
are nontrivial when k ∈ [0, 1/2]) we obtain the equality case in Theorem 2.1.
We note that Gp is linear on the triangular cone {z ≤ min{x, y}} ∩ Ω, and
on the hyperplanes {z = γx} ∩ Ω and {z = γy} ∩ Ω for each γ ≥ 1. The first
condition gives (f g)p/2 ≤ min{f p , g p }, so f = g on {f g > 0} in the case p > 0

6

and on {f g < ∞} in the case p < 0. The second condition gives (f g)p/2 = γf p ,
and the third (f g)p/2 = γg p . When p > 0 the second condition gives that g = λf
on {f > 0} for some λ ≥ 1, and the third gives that f = λg on {g > 0} for some
λ ≥ 1; when p < 0 the second condition gives g = λf on {f < ∞} for some λ ≤ 1,
and the third gives that f = λg on {g < ∞} for some λ ≤ 1.

To conclude the section we address the optimality of Theorems 2.1 and 2.5 in
the measure space (X, A, µ) = ([0, 1], B, dx). We define
o
n
p/2
B p (x, y, z) = sup kf + gkpp : (kf kpp , kgkpp , kf gkp/2) = (x, y, z) ,
o
n
p/2
B p (x, y, z) = inf kf + gkpp : (kf kpp , kgkpp , kf gkp/2) = (x, y, z) .

It is easy to see that B p , B p are defined on a cone Ωp ⊂ Ω, are locally bounded by
the inequalities (f + g)p ≤ 2p−1 (f p + g p ) for p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ [1, ∞) and (f + g)p ≤
f p + g p for p ∈ (0, 1], are one-homogeneous, and equal ϕp on ∂Ω (by the equality
case of Cauchy-Schwarz). Furthermore, by Lemma 3.1 we have
H p ≤ Bp ≤ Bp ≤ H p

on the common domain of definition.

Lemma 3.3. If B p (B p ) is defined on all of Ω and is concave (convex), then
H p = Bp

(B p = H p ).

Proof. Local boundedness and concavity of B p implies continuity in the interior of
Ω, and since B p is trapped between envelopes that attain the data continuously,
we have B p ∈ C(Ω). Since H p is the smallest such concave function, we conclude
that B p ≥ H p . The argument is similar for B p .

Thus, it just remains to show that when (X, A, µ) = ([0, 1], B, dx), the domain
of definition for B p and B p is all of Ω, and that B p is concave and B p is convex.
Lemma 3.4. For (X, A, µ) = ([0, 1], B, dx) we have Ωp = Ω for all p 6= 0, that
B p is concave in Ω, and that B p is convex in Ω.
The optimality of the inequalities in Theorems 2.1 and 2.5 follows:
Proof of Optimality Statements: For either inequality, given
p/2

(x, y, z) = (kf kpp , kgkpp , kf gkp/2 ),
the functions B p (x, y, z) and B p (x, y, z) are by definition the best we can do.

These are equal to the envelopes H p , H p by Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4.
Remark 3.5. For given (x, y, z) ∈ Ω and p ∈ R\{0}, the supremum (infimum) in
the definition of B p (B p ) is in fact attained.
For equality in (3) consider pairs of the form (f, g) = (a, b)χ[0, c] + (b, a)χ[c, 1]
for a, b, c chosen appropriately.
For equality in (7), consider pairs of the form
(f, g) = (a, a)χ[0, 1/2] + (b, 0)χ[1/2, 3/4] + (0, c)χ[3/4, 1]
for a, b, c appropriately chosen when z ≤ min{x, y}, and (f, g) = (a, b)χ[0, 1/2] +
(c, d)χ[1/2, 1] when z > min{x, y} for appropriate a, b, c, d, with one of c, d equal
to 0.

For equality in (8), consider pairs of the form
(f, g) = (a, a)χ[0, 1/2] + (b, ∞)χ[1/2, 3/4] + (∞, c)χ[3/4, 1]

for a, b, c appropriately chosen when z ≤ min{x, y}, and (f, g) = (a, b)χ[0, 1/2] +
(c, d)χ[1/2, 1] when z > min{x, y} for appropriate a, b, c, d, with one of c, d equal
to ∞.

Proof of Lemma 3.4: For the first part, if p > 0 take fs = (2x)1/p χ[s, s+1/2] for
s ∈ [0, 1/2] and let g = (2y)1/p χ[1/2, 1] . Then kfs kpp = x and kgkpp = y. Furtherp/2

more, we have h(s) := kfs gkp/2 is continuous, increasing, and h(0) = 0, h(1/2) =
√
xy. When p < 0, use the same example but set fs , g = ∞ where they were
previously zero.
For the second part, let (xi , yi , zi ) ∈ Ω with i = 1, 2, and for ǫ > 0 choose fi , gi
p/2
such that (xi , yi , zi ) = (kfi kpp , kgi kpp , kfi gi kp/2 ) and
kfi + gi kpp ≥ B p (xi , yi , zi ) − ǫ,

i = 1, 2.

Extend fi , gi to be zero outside of [0, 1], and define the rescalings
f˜1 (s) = 21/p f1 (2s), g˜1 (s) = 21/p g1 (2s), f˜2 (s) = 21/p f2 (2s−1), g˜2 (s) = 21/p g2 (2s−1),
so that f˜i , g̃i are supported in [0, 1/2] for i = 1 and in [1/2, 1] for i = 2. We then
have

Taking ǫ → 0, we conclude that B p is concave. The convex direction is similar. 
Remark 3.6. Lemma 3.4 holds for any measure space with translation and scaling
properties similar to ([0, 1], B, dx), e.g. (B1 ⊂ Rn , B, dx).
Remark 3.7. The fact that B p is concave also follows from Theorem 1 in [4]. Since
the argument is simple, we decided to include it for the reader’s convenience.
4. Envelopes
In this section we prove Proposition 3.2. We begin with some simple observations.
First, to check concavity (convexity) in Ω and continuity up to ∂Ω of H p (H p ),
by one-homogeneity it suffices to check these properties on the half-ellipse
D := Ω ∩ {x + y = 2}.

More generally, any one-homogeneous function B in a convex cone in Rn (say
contained in {xn > 0}) is concave (convex) if it is concave (convex) when restricted
to a cross-section of the cone (say {xn = 1}). Indeed, by one-homogeneity we have

, and the statement follows by applying concavity / convexity of
where λ = xnx+y
n
B on the cross-section and then using one-homogeneity once more.
Second, to prove that H p (H p ) is the concave (convex) envelope of ϕp , it suffices to check that each point in the interior of D lies on a segment that connects
boundary points of D, on which H p (H p ) is linear. Indeed, then any linear function
larger (smaller) than ϕp on ∂Ω will then be larger than H p (smaller than H p ) in
the interior of Ω.

Proof of Proposition 3.2. We first examine Fp , and then Gp .
The Function Fp . On D we can write Fp (1 + s, 1 − s, t) = u(t), where
h
ip
p
p
u(t) := (1 + 1 − t2 )1/p + (1 − 1 − t2 )1/p , t ∈ [0, 1].

It is clear that Fp is continuous up to ∂D for each p ∈ R\{0}, and√u(0) = ϕp (that
is, 2 if p > 0 and 0 if p < 0) on the bottom of D and Fp (1−s, 1+s, 1 − s2 ) = ((1+
s)1/p + (1 − s)1/p )p = ϕp on the top of D. Since Fp is constant along the horizontal
segments in D, it suffices to check that u is concave when p ∈ (0, 1] ∩ [2, ∞), and
convex otherwise. To that end, we let t = sin(x), with x ∈ [0, π/2]. Then
h
ip
u(sin(x)) = (1 + cos(x))1/p + (1 − cos(x))1/p .

Let us rewrite the last equality as

h
ip
1
u(sin(2s)) = sin2/p (s) + cos2/p (s) ,
2
where s = x/2 ∈ [0, π/4]. Differentiating both sides of the equality in s, we obtain

Let us study the sign of v(x). Without loss of generality assume that p 6= 1, 2,

Therefore, if p ∈ (2, ∞) it follows from concavity of x 7→ x1/p that v ′ ≥ 0, and
hence v ≤ 0, i.e., u is concave. Similarly, if p ∈ (1, 2), then v ≥ 0, i.e., u is convex.
Next, if p ∈ (0, 1) then x 7→ x1/p is convex, and hence v ′ ≥ 0, i.e., u is concave.
Finally, if p ∈ (−∞, 0) then x 7→ x1/p is convex, and therefore v ′ ≤ 0, i.e., u is
convex.
The Function Gp . Let bp (s, z) = Gp (1 + s, 1 − s, z), with (s, z) in the upper
half-disc. For p > 0 we can write bp explicitly as
(
w(1 − |s|, z), z ≥ 1 − |s|
bp (s, z) = 2 +
(2p − 2)z, z < 1 − |s|,
where w is the one-homogeneous function given by
p

w(t, z) := t1/p + (z 2 /t)1/p − (t + (z 2 /t))

10

with (t, z) ∈ (0, 1)2 . It is easy to √
check that bp continuously takes the boundary
values bp (s, 0) = 2 = ϕp and bp (s, 1 − s2 ) = ((1 + s)1/p + (1 − s)1/p )p = ϕp . Let
p

h(t) := w(t, 1) = t1/p + t−1/p − (t + t−1 ), t ∈ (0, 1).

By the one-homogeneity of w and the fact that bp is linear on the triangle {z <
1 − |s|} with vertical gradient, if we show that h′ (1) = 0 and that h is concave /
convex on [0, 1], then bp is C 1 away from (s, z) = (±1, 0) and concave / convex.
Furthermore, bp is linear when restricted to the segments through (s, z) = (±1, 0)
that lie outside of the triangle {z ≤ 1 − |s|}, so Gp is the concave / convex envelope
provided the above conditions on h are confirmed. To that end we compute the
first two derivatives of h. The first derivative is
h′ (t) = (t1/p + t−1/p )p−1 (t1/p−1 − t−1/p−1 ) − (1 − t−2 ).

This confirms that h′ (1) = 0. The second derivative is

Let x := t2/p ∈ [0, 1]. It suffices to show that

gp (x) := (1 + (2/p − 1)x) − (1 + x)2−p

satisfies gp ≤ 0 on [0, 1] for p ∈ (1, 2) and gp ≥ 0 on [0, 1] for p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞).
Note that gp (0) = 0. The desired inequality for gp (1) is equivalent to the fact that
the linear function p crosses the convex function 2p−1 at p = 1 and p = 2. Finally,
we observe that the first term in gp is linear, and the second term is convex for
p ∈ (1, 2) and concave for p ∈ (0, 1) ∪ (2, ∞). The desired inequality for gp (x)
with x ∈ (0, 1) follows immediately from this observation and the inequalities at
the endpoints x = 0 and x = 1.
When p < 0 we can write bp explicitly as
(
w̃(1 − |s|, z), z ≥ 1 − |s|
bp (s, z) =
2p z, z < 1 − |s|,
where w̃ is the one-homogeneous function given by
p

w̃(t, z) := t1/p + (z 2 /t)1/p

with (t, z) ∈ (0, 1)2 . The same considerations as above reduce the problem to
showing that

h̃(t) := w̃(t, 1) = t1/p + t−1/p

satisfies h̃′ (1) = 0 and h̃ is concave on [0, 1]. We have
h̃′ = (t1/p + t−1/p )p−1 (t1/p−1 − t−1/p−1 ) ⇒ h̃′ (1) = 0,

h̃′′ = 2t−2 (t1/p + t−1/p )p−2 [t−2/p + (2/p − 1)],
and the conclusion follows quickly using p < 0.

Remark 4.1. It follows from the concavity / convexity properties of Gp that
Gp (x, y, z) ≤ x + y + (2p − 2)z

when p ∈ [1, 2], and the inequality reverses for p ∈ (0, 1]∪[2, ∞). Indeed, Gp agrees
with the linear function on the right hand side on an open set. We conclude from
Theorem 2.5 that for any nonnegative numbers a, b, and any p ∈ [1, 2], we have
(a + b)p ≤ ap + bp + (2p − 2)(ab)p/2 ,

and the inequality reverses if p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞).
5. Proof of Corollary 2.6
In this final section we prove Corollary 2.6.
Proof of Corollary 2.6: Recall from Remark 4.1 that for any nonnegative numbers a, b, and any p ∈ [1, 2], we have
(a + b)p ≤ ap + bp + (2p − 2)(ab)p/2 ,

and the inequality reverses for p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞). Since for p ∈ [0, 2] we have
(a + b)p/2 ≤ ap/2 + bp/2 , and the reverse inequality if p ≥ 2, it follows by induction
that for any nonnegative numbers aj ≥ 0 we have

holds true for p ∈ [1, 2], and the reverse inequality if p ∈ (0, 1] ∪ [2, ∞). Finally it
remains to put aj = fj (x) and integrate the inequality.


Remark 5.1. When p < 0, inequality (11) does not hold with three or more aj .
Take e.g. aj = 1 for j ≤ 3.
6. Concluding Remarks on Envelopes
An important challenge in this work was to compute the envelopes (9) and (10).
In this section we briefly explain how we found them.
We recall from Section 3 that for the measure space ([0, 1], B, dx) we have
B p = H p is defined on Ω, one-homogeneous, and equals ϕp on ∂Ω; that is,
√
H p (x, y, xy) = (x1/p +y 1/p )p . We also recall from the discussion at the beginning
of Section 4 that by one-homogeneity, to compute H p it is enough to restrict our
attention to the cross-section D = Ω ∩ {x + y = 2}. Writing D = {(1 + s, 1 − s, z)}
with (s, z) in the upper half-disc, this reduces the problem understanding how the
upper boundary of the convex envelope of the space curve
p
γ(s) = (s, 1 − s2 , ((1 − s)1/p + (1 + s)1/p )p ), s ∈ [−1, 1]

looks. One can show that the torsion τγ of the space curve γ changes sign only
once from − to +, at s = 0, when p ∈ (0, 1) ∪ (2, ∞), and from + to − when
p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ (1, 2). Consider the case p ∈ (0, 1) ∪ (2, ∞). Then it follows from

Lemma 29 of Section 3.2 in [5] that locally, say for some δ ∈ (0, 1], there exists a
function a(s) : [0, δ] → [−1, 0] such that a(0) = 0, a(s) is strictly decreasing, and
the function B(u, w) defined parametrically by
p
p
B(λ(a(s), 1 − a(s)2 ) + (1 − λ)(s, 1 − s2 )) =
λ((1 − a(s)1/p + (1 + a(s))1/p )p + (1 − λ)((1 − s)1/p + (1 + s)1/p )p

for λ ∈ [0, 1], s ∈ [0, √
δ] is concave. In other words B has the prescribed boundary
condition, i.e., B(s, 1 − s2p
) = ((1 − s)1/p√
+ (1 + s)1/p )p , it is linear along the
line segments ℓ(s) := [(a(s), 1 − a(s)2 ), (s, 1 − s2 )], and B is concave. It follows
that “locally” B is a concave envelope. Because of the symmetry in x and y of the
boundary data ϕp , one can show that the line segments ℓ(s) must be horizontal,
i.e., a(s) = −s, and in fact δ = 1. This means that B is a global concave envelope

√
for all |u| ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ w ≤ 1 − u2 . Now it remains to change variables back to
recover the envelope (9).
The case p ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ (1, 2) is different because τγ changes sign from + to −,
and in this case an “angle” arises with vertex sitting around the point s = 0 (see
Section 3 in [5]).
