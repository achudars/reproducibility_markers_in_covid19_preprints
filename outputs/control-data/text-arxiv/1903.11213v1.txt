In this work, we examine metal electrode-ionomer electrolyte systems at high voltage
/ negative surface charge and at high pH to assess factors that influence hydrogen
production efficiency. We simulate the hydrogen evolution electrode interface investigated experimentally in Bates et al., Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 2015 using
a combination of first principles calculations and classical molecular dynamics. With
this detailed molecular information, we explore the hypotheses posed in Bates et
al. In particular we examine the response of the system to increased bias voltage
and oxide coverage in terms of the potential profile, changes in solvation and species
concentrations away from the electrode, surface concentrations, and orientation of
water at reactive surface sites. We discuss this response in the context of hydrogen
production.

INTRODUCTION
Hydrogen has the capacity to be an ecologically-friendly fuel since water is the primary

by-product of its use. Many technological and economic challenges remain in realizing a viable hydrogen economy and energy system1,2 . The central issue is that molecular hydrogen
gas does not occur naturally in abundance and must be produced industrially. Currently,
the majority of hydrogen is generated by either high-temperature/high-energy methane reforming or the water-gas shift reaction which produces significant carbon dioxide, while the
electrolysis of water accounts for a relatively minor proportion of its production3 . As electrolysis is not directly dependent on fossil fuels there is strong motivation to develop a low
cost, low energy electrolytic process. Since electrolysis traditionally depends on expensive
Pt-group catalysts, transition metal catalysts are being developed.
Mukerjee and co-workers have been developing Ni based catalysts with ionomer-based
electrolytes4,5 which show promise but are still confronted by development challenges in
part due to the need for a more fundamental understanding of the electrode-electrolyte
interaction. In Bates et al.4 a number of hypotheses were put forward:
‚Ä¢ The electrical potential is significantly altered by the ionomer. The ionomer extends
the ‚Äúelectrified interface‚Äù near the catalyst. The potential at the inner Helmholtz
plane dictates the rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This potential is
more positive than it would be in absence of ionomer and this affects the reactant
water molecules at the inner plane.
‚Ä¢ The water molecules inside the inner Helmholtz plane orient with dipoles pointing
away from the electrode due to the presence of the ionomer, and this facilitates HOH
cleavage on the metal catalyst
‚Ä¢ The ionomer itself straddles the inner and outer Helmholtz planes and is directly
chemisorbed on the metal surface.
‚Ä¢ The majority of the metal surface is coordinated with water molecules.
‚Ä¢ Nanoscale heterogeneity provides a high density of adjacent metal/metal-oxide sites
where metallic Ni has an affinity for H-bonding, and NiOx has an affinity for adsorbed OH‚àí , in-line with Markovic‚Äôs theory of enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction
2

on composite metal/metal-oxide surfaces6‚Äì8 .
In this work we investigate these hypotheses via molecular simulation. Since a system
encompassing the compact/diffuse layers of the long chain ionomer-based electrolyte is too
large for ab initio calculations such as Refs. 9‚Äì17, which allow charge transfer and spontaneous dissociation, we employ classical molecular dynamics (MD) to model the system at
the relevant length and time scales. Water-metal interfaces have been studied with MD for
some time18‚Äì26 . The absence of chemical reactions in these simulations is offset by the fact
that these reactions are fast compared to diffusion timescales resolvable with MD and we
pre-populate the simulation with the relevant chemical species. We assume simulations of
the isothermal steady-state accounting for electrostatic and steric interactions with the experimentally observed species concentrations is informative of the transport-limited steady
operation of the actual cell. Also, we apply ab initio methods to assess the near electrode
charge environment and use this information in the MD model of the electrode. We focus
on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) environment at the negatively charged electrode
(cathode). Here the ionomer is in contact with bare metal (Ni) and metal oxide (NiOx ) at
the electrode surface. The ionomer-based electrolyte has characteristics that differ from the
well-studied dissolved salt electrolytes. For instance, the ionomer is relatively immobile due
to its polymeric structure with fixed charge centers (N+ ), while the counter ions (OH‚àí ) are
mobile. The influence of the immobile charge in ionomer strands/chains on performance is
central to our investigation.
Given its importance, the structure and chemistry of water near a metal surface has long
and intense field of study in and of itself, which is reviewed in Refs. 27‚Äì31. The examination
of the water-surface interactions has been pursued in great detail by combinations of microscopy and ab initio simulation (typically in vacuum), as in Ref. 32, and has lead to many
postulated and observed intact, partially dissociated, and fully dissociated configurations of
water at uncharged atomically flat and rough surfaces. Despite the limitations of classical
MD, we attempt to interpret the results of this study in the context of this deep body of
research.
In Sec. II we briefly review the relevant theory. With representative electrode-ionomer
systems we simulate the response of these systems to a range of external electrical bias
and characterize this response by a variety of means to address the hypotheses in Bates
et al.4 . In Sec. III we describe how we use spatial resolution of charge density, per-species
3

radial distributions and other fields to quantify the location of the Helmholtz planes and
significant concentrations of the reactive species. The results are given in Sec. IV and are
discussed in Sec. V in light of the hypotheses of Bates et al.4

II.

THEORY
Due to high electric fields near electrodes, charged mobile species tend to pack and

form characteristic structures and concentration profiles. This phenomena is modelled in
classical theory by Helmholtz33 , Gouy34 , Chapman35 , Stern36 and others, and is still a topic
of current research37 . Here we will briefly review the relevant theory to assist in interpreting
the molecular results in Sec. IV.
The most commonly used theory is the Gouy-Champman-Stern (GCS) model, composed
of a compact layer of ions next to the electrode and a diffuse layer beyond. The compact
layer is bounded by the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) at a layer of unsolvated ions adsorbed
on the electrode surface and the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) where ions are fully solvated.
The interior of the compact layer is assumed to be charge free due to steric effects. The
structure of the diffuse layer is governed by the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation where
the electrostatic interaction of the ions is given by the Poisson equation:
‚àí ‚àá ¬∑ (‚àáœÜ) = œÅ .

(1)

Here, œÜ is the electric potential and  is the electric permittivity. The net charge density œÅ
is given by:
œÅ=e

za ca ,

(2)

a

where za is the valence of species a, ca is its concentration, and e is the unit of elemental
charge. In equilibrium, the absence of fluxes implies that both the electrochemical potential,
eza œÜ + kB T ln ca , and the temperature, T , are constant across the system domain. This
condition leads to species concentrations, ca , that vary with the local potential œÜ:

ca = cÃÑa exp

(3)

where cÃÑa is the far-field/bulk concentration of species a. Substituting Eq. (2), and Eq. (3) in
Eq. (1) results in the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation. The characteristic thickness of the

which is the similarity parameter in the solution of the linearized PB equations. For more
details see Ref. 38(Sec.13.3), Ref. 39 (Chap.12), and Ref. 40 (Sec.7.4).
Real electrode-electrolyte systems deviate from GCS for a number of reasons such as:
finite ion size and correlation effects due to van der Waals interactions, and a non-uniform
dielectric field due to varying concentration and discrete charges41‚Äì43 . Also theoretical concepts such as full solvation and the location of Helmholtz planes become less well-defined. In
the present case, an electrolyte with a dense ionomer, the charge centers of ionomer chains
are effectively immobile and a simple model assumes these ionomer charges provide a background charge density which is fully solvated and screened far from the electrode. It follows
that the PB equation governs the excess charge of the counter ion. This paradigm holds
where counter ions stay bound to ionomer charge centers, and fails where the electric field
is strong enough to dissociate the mobile species from the charge centers. The solution to
the PB equation for the counter ions only44 is:

where œÜ0 is the potential at x = 0, ` = 2 keœÉ

Note that the dielectric of the electrolyte, , is assumed to be spatially uniform in this
derivation. This diffuse layer solution has an electric field E = ‚àí‚àáœÜ that is zero far away
from the electrode and has the magnitude

applied to the electrode (this discussed in more detail in the next section).

METHOD

To simulate the metal electrode-ionomer based electrolyte system, we employ a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and classical molecular dynamics (MD). We use
DFT to determine the charge state of the metal HER electrode, which is our primary focus. We use MD to model the dynamics of the molecular species of the electrolyte through
5

interplay of electrostatic, elastic, steric and diffusion forces in the overall system. By its
explicit representation of atoms and atomic bonding, MD is known to capture deviations
from classical theories such as GCS45‚Äì47 .
In the molecular model, the electrode-electrolyte system atoms and molecules interact
with each other via the well-known CHARMM empirical potential48 . This often employed
potential depends on atomic charges and proximity. It is composed of short-range van der
Waals interactions, long-range Coulomb interactions, and intramolecular covalent bonds:

efficiently compute the long-range Coulomb interactions with a short/long cutoff of 12 AÃä .
Here, the permittivity of free space is Œµ0 = 0.00552635 e/V-AÃä . The intra-molecular bonds

A.

Electrode
Given the form of the interatomic potential, Eq. (7), which includes Coulomb forces, we

need the point charges qŒ± for the classical representation of the electrode via Eq. (7) and the
response of the electrode point charges to electrical bias/external potential V . We use DFT
with PBE/GGA level of theory50 to obtain relaxed surface structures, and compute point
charges via a Bader analysis of the charge density field51 .
Since only studies of small systems are feasible with DFT, we examined specific domains
of a partially oxidized Ni electrode: bare Ni, partially oxidized Ni, and Ni covered by an
NiO layer. For each, we create a small, laterally periodic system to calculate charge density
using a FCC unit cell with a 3.52 AÃä lattice constant for Ni regions and a cubic B1 unit cell
6

with a 4.17 AÃä lattice constant for NiO regions. We select (100)-oriented (non-polar) surfaces
for both Ni and NiO. The surfaces neighbor vacuum regions, not representative electrolytes,
for simplicity and under the assumption that the proximity of the electrolyte evokes only
perturbations of the charge density. We employ an energy cutoff of 500 eV for the metallic
systems and 800 eV for the systems containing oxides, together with an 8√ó8√ó1 Œì centered
k-point grid. After computing a baseline charge density, we add excess electrons to emulate
negative charging of the electrode of interest. Finally, we obtain the electrode point charges
qŒ±0 (œÉ):

charges (corrected for the homogeneous background charge and normalized such that ‚àÜqŒ±

= 1 e for the surface atoms), œÉ is the target surface charge density, and Œ∑ is surface atom
density. The number of excess electrons added the systems to obtain the perturbed charge
field is on the order of 0.1 e per surface atom and on par with the perturbation needed to
achieve the voltage bias V in the range V ‚âà 0‚Äì2.5 V in the experimental system. Lastly, the
scaling of Eq. (8) with external voltage V follows V ‚âà

however, we recover the actual

voltage in the MD systems via a Gauss box method described in Sec. III.
In addition to the point charges required for Coulomb interactions, short-range parameters Œµab and œÉab for the electrode interactions with the ionomer are needed. By assuming
traditional Lorentz-Berthelot mixing, only the LJ self-self pair parameters are required. We
obtain these from published, surface specific parameterizations: for Ni, œÉNiNi = 2.274 AÃä and
NiNi = 5.65 kcal/mol Ref. 52(Table 1): and for NiO, œÉOO = 1.292 AÃä and OO = 35.62 kcal/mol
Ref. 53(Table 1).54 For simplicity (since no additional parameters are needed) and efficiency
we neglect thermal motion of the electrode and fix the locations of its Ni and O atoms.

B.

Electrolyte
The selected ionomer (PAP-DP-60) is an amorphous material composed of long polymer

chains with N+ charge centers charge-balanced by OH‚àí together with water. Each chain is
comprised of charged (c) and neutral units (n), see Fig. 1, in a ratio c:n = 60:40 with lengths
of 30 to 40 units in a random sequence. The mass density of the ionomer is 1.1 g/cm3 with
about 40% water by weight at room temperature and pH in the range 13 to 14+.
7

Using these experimental measurements, we created representative models of the ionomer
electrolyte, see Fig. 2. First we created chains from the units using a random sequence that
respected the experimental bounds on length and c:n ratio. Next we added molecular water
and OH‚àí ions. To achieve the experimentally measured density, we compressed the ionomerelectrolyte mixture then relaxed the compressed configuration at 2000 K via isothermal
dynamics to relieve unphysical local configurations for 0.4 ns. Finally, we cooled the system
to 300 K at 10 K/ps and let it equilibrate for 0.1 ns. To complete the electrode-electrolyte
system seen in Fig. 2, we added the primary Ni electrode plus a soft wall and counter
electrode to bound the system. The separation of the capping wall and the counter electrode
was expedient due to different densities and lengths of the replicas while maintaining the
same effective gradient in external potential. Due to computational cost we can only place
the counter electrode 400 nm from the surface of the primary electrode. As stated in the
introduction, our focus is on the Ni electrode where the HER occurs and, hence, we model
it in detail and simplify the counter electrode. For our purposes this is sufficient as long
as the diffuse layer near the primary electrode relaxes to the bulk, and the region away
from the primary electrode is not depleted of mobile species. As we will see in Sec. IV both
these conditions are satisfied. Also, in preliminary studies, the lateral dimensions of the
systems where increased to the point where the charge density profiles and related measures
converged to within the expected statistical noise.
Since the ionomer is amorphous, we generated a number of statistically equivalent replica
systems to improve sampling and reduce finite size effects. The isothermal dynamics of the
electrolyte were evolved with a NoseÃÅ-Hoover algorithm which accommodated the rigidity
of the intramolecular bonds. All reported results are the average of 8 configurations timeaveraged and simulated for 0.4 ns each with a 1 fs time-step.
Finally, we use a so-called Gauss box to recover the electric potential œÜ from the point
charges qŒ± . Briefly, starting with Gauss‚Äôs law for a quasi-one dimensional system, with
electric field E ‚â° ‚àí‚àáœÜ = Ee3 and cross-sectional area A, we obtain:

Also, we extract coarse-grained profiles of radial distribution functions (RDFs) of particular

RESULTS

We compare the response of the electrolyte to electrode bias voltage using a variety of
configurational metrics in order to provide insight and support to the experimental hypotheses described in the Introduction. We focus on (a) bare Ni, (b) fully NiO covered and (c)
partially NiO covered regions of the Ni electrode. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the qualitative
differences in surface coverage of the relevant species and water orientation for the three
cases. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

Electrode charge distributions
Using first principles methods described in Sec. III A we obtain the relaxed configuration

and electron density of the electrode with and without an oxide layer. Fig. 5 shows a top
down view of the charge density of a Ni surface partially covered by a NiO monolayer. The
NiO island is in the lower left of Fig. 5 and the exposed portion of the underlying Ni surface
can be seen in the remainder of the figure. The initially square island relaxes to a more
diamond-like shape but the variation in charge density across the partial layer is minimal,
with charge transfer from the O to Ni nuclei as expected. Also, the charge density of the
exposed Ni metal is relatively unperturbed by the oxide layer. The mean separation between
the Ni and the NiO layer is ‚âà2 AÃä. With a sequence of related simulations we examined where
the excess electrons (induced by electrode charging) reside. Fig. 6 plots the point charges (in
excess of normal valence: metal Ni 0, oxide Ni +2, O -2) for bare Ni and Ni covered by 1, 2,
and 3 monolayers of NiO (the point charges for an overall neutral system and one with excess
electrons are extracted with a Bader method described in Sec. III and then differenced). As
expected, in the bare Ni, the excess electron density resides primarily in the outermost layer
of Ni. For a single layer of NiO covering Ni ‚âà 80% of the excess electrons reside near the O,
‚âà 10% near the Ni in the oxide layer and ‚âà 10% near the Ni in the underlying metal. This
charge splitting induces a surface dipole moment. It is apparent that the charge distribution
and the dipole effects become more complex as more oxide layers are added to the system.

Bare metal region of the electrode
With classical MD, we simulated the electrode-electrolyte systems over a sequence of

surface charges: ‚àÜq = {0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15} e per surface atom, corresponding to œÉ =

{0.007, 0.014, 0.021, 0.028} e/AÃä2 . These surface charges were related to voltage through the
Gauss box technique described in Sec. III.
Fig. 7 shows that the voltages at the electrode surface (z=0) range from 0 to ‚âà 2 V for
these surface charges. Also, it is apparent from the charge density profiles that: (a) both a
12

double layer next to the electrode and a diffuse layer grading to the bulk form exist, and (b)
the decay to the bulk region with zero net charge occurs within 20AÃä from the outer layer of
the electrode. We fit the potential profile in the diffuse region (approximately 5‚Äì20AÃä from
the electrode surface) to the Poisson-Boltzmann solution in Eq. (5) and obtain ` ‚âà 0.5 AÃä
for q = -0.1 e/atom. This allowed us to estimate the effective dielectric in the diffuse layer
=

2kB T

‚âà 24.40 which is considerably less than pure water ( ‚âà 800 ).

In Fig. 7 we also see that the region of significant dipole moment near the electrode decays to the bulk on the same scale as the potential that induces the orientation of the water
molecules. Most significantly, the dipole moment is mostly negative and increases in magnitude with applied bias, which corresponds to the expected conformation of the H atoms of
the water molecules oriented closest to the negative electrode, and this orientation becoming
more dominant with increased bias. This finding is corroborated by direct observation, as in
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 (at q = -0.1 e/atom), where the white, partially positively charged H atoms
lie on the electrode surface with the red, partially negatively charged O atoms of the same
water molecules pointing away from the surface. Either one or both hydrogens is directly
associated with distinct metal surface atoms. In a second layer, we observe some water
molecules bridging water on the surface with their hydrogens associated with the oxygens of
the surface adsorbed waters. Even at zero bias it appears there is some orientational preference for the water molecules which must be induced by the particular LJ parameters for H
and O atoms in the water molecules. (The preferential alignment of water with uncharged
surfaces is widely observed30 .)
Fig. 8 shows that at zero bias, H2 O, OH‚àí and the N+ of the ionomer are adsorbed to
the electrode surface and maintain uniform bulk concentrations away from the electrode.
At higher biases OH‚àí is excluded near the electrode, and water fills the vacated region and
forms structured layers. The spatial distribution of N+ (averaged over time and the replica
systems) is effectively uniform in the electrolyte region except there is a significantly higher
concentration of N+ at the interface (with corresponding neighboring region of depletion).
This appears to be due to the fact that ends of the chains are relatively mobile, unentangled
and attracted to surface of the negative electrode. The concentration of N+ at the electrode
more than doubles with the applied bias of ‚âà 2 V and the response appears to be nonlinear,
most likely due to an energy barrier in straightening the ends of the ionomer chains. This
can be seen as competition of elastic versus Coulomb forces for the relatively immobile N+ .
13

Note that these biases are high enough to dissociate water in the real system and the ionomer
near the electrode might be likewise affected. The mobile species, H2 O and OH‚àí , respond
as mentioned. From Fig. 3, it apparent that no ring-like water structures form and that,
generally, the N+ of the ionomer appear in regions of low concentrations of surface adsorbed
water. We presume that the near surface N+ of the ionomer displace water and disrupt the
tendency for the water to form regular structures. The OH‚àí transitions from significant
surface adsorbed species at no bias to progressively vacated regions with increased voltage.
Here again, a threshold (determined by the relative magnitude of the overall electric field
separating OH‚àí and N+ versus the LJ and Coulomb forces binding them) appears to be
operating. For biases less than q =-0.05 e/atom (not shown) OH‚àí remains bound to N+ .
Note that effectively no OH‚àí is present near the electrode at the q =-0.10 e/atom surface
charge as shown in Fig. 5a. Water, on the other hand, displays a surface adsorbed layer, a
depletion zone, and then a uniform bulk concentration at no bias. With increasing voltage
more structured water layers appear near the surface and the closest layer becomes more
packed (higher surface coverage).
Fig. 9 shows the spatially binned RDFs for zero bias and q =-0.10 e/atom. First of all, we
see that OH‚àí is closely coordinated with H2 O and this strong association does not change
wherever OH‚àí is present. At voltage the only effect is decreasing the magnitude (not the
location) of the RDF peak due to decreased OH‚àí concentration near the electrode surface
(refer to Fig. 8). Note no OH‚àí is present at 0‚Äì6AÃä from the electrode at q =-0.10 e/atom.
The coordination of N+ with H2 O is uniform at zero bias and relatively unaffected at high
bias which implies the OHP defined by H2 O solvation of N+ is within 3 AÃä of the outer layer
of electrode surface. The effects of distance from the electrode and bias on the coordination
of N+ with OH‚àí are more complex due to changing local electric field and concentration.
Given the location of the RDF peaks, the primary coordination shell of OH‚àí appears to
mix with that of H2 O. Most significant of the changes is that N+ coordination with OH‚àí
tightens and sharpens at high bias and near the electrode, particularly in the 6‚Äì9AÃä bin at
q= -0.1 e/atom. In the next bin, 9‚Äì12AÃä, we see two peaks corresponding to a two shell
arrangement; and, by the 15‚Äì18AÃä bin, the RDF resembles that of the bulk in both the zero
and high bias cases. If we use the coordination of N+ with OH‚àí to indicate the location
of the OHP, we see the OHP shift away from the electrode surface reaching ‚âà 20 AÃä at the

highest bias, as Fig. 8 indicates, due to the dissociation of the OH‚àí from the N+ at high

C.

Oxide covered region of the electrode
As observed in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the presence of a (single layer of) NiO qualitatively

changes the response of the HER electrode to electrical bias. Comparing the surface coverage
of a bare Ni region of the electrode with partially and fully covered NiO regions, we see
approximately 40% increase of adsorbed water where there is oxide on the surface. Fig. 3
also illustrates that there is distinctly increased water surface concentration at the NiO
boundary. The side view of the electrode in Fig. 3 and the closeup in Fig. 4 shows water
molecules on the surface of the NiO covered electrode with one of the O-H legs of the water
molecule flat on the surface and the other with H embedded in the oxide layer in direct
association with an oxide O atom. These effects are, in large part, due to the differences in
the unbiased point charges and induced charge distribution (refer to Fig. 6). Since oxides
are dielectrics, they change local and long-range electric fields by screening due to induced
and/or permanent dipoles.
At the same surface charges and comparable voltages to the simulation of the bare Ni
region of the electrode discussed in the previous section, we compute the electrolyte‚Äôs re16

sponse to electrical bias for a Ni electrode with a monolayer of NiO as shown in Fig. 10.
There are some similarities and noticeable differences in the profiles compared to the bare
Ni case shown in Fig. 7. Firstly, there is a larger counter charge density next to the electrode
in the NiO-on-Ni case, which we can associate with the partially positively charged H in the
increased density of surface water molecules. Examining the dipole density, the H-toward
orientation is strong and barely shifts with increasing bias due to the strong, local polarization of the electrode itself. This near-surface dipole density is reflected in the electric
potential which becomes constant but not zero in the far-field. This also leads to a lower
effective voltage difference for the same surface charge, as expected with a dielectric layer.
In addition, the more prominent positive dipole peak seen in Fig. 10 compared to Fig. 7
is apparently due the dipole created by neighboring waters to since no inversions of water
molecules with the H toward the surface were observed.
Likewise the concentration profiles shown in Fig. 11 are comparable to Fig. 8 but also
display distinct differences. As in Fig. 8, the water density is uniform in the far-field and
shows distinct signs of structured layers near the electrode. On the other-hand, the (timeaveraged) water density at the electrode surface is much higher than in the bare metal case
(approximately 40%, as corroborated by the snapshots shown in Fig. 3). Also, this spike in
concentration is essentially unaffected by bias, a fact corroborated by nearly constant dipole
density at the surface. Remarkably, significant OH‚àí remains associated with the electrode
surface at high bias, but concentration decreases with increased bias (similar behavior has
been observed in other systems47 ). Otherwise, the OH‚àí is similar to that for bare Ni, with
a depletion zone increasing with increased bias and a nearly constant bulk concentration.
The N+ concentration is also similar to that for the bare Ni, shown in Fig. 8, but has a
pronounced double peak near the interface. This feature is perhaps related to significant
residual OH‚àí concentration at the surface with bias.
The spatially binned RDFs shown in Fig. 12 are qualitatively similar to Fig. 9, implying
that the electrode surface is not radically changing the coordination structures. There is
a slight variation in OH‚àí and H2 O concentration at low bias which affects OH‚àí :H2 O and
N+ :H2 O coordination that is not observed in Fig. 9. The presence of OH‚àí near the N+
closest to the electrode in this case also appears in the N+ :OH‚àí RDF but it is omitted in
Fig. 9 due to sampling noise and an effort to maintain clarity. Also, in this case the N+ :OH‚àí
RDF clearly relaxes to bulk distribution at zero bias.

DISCUSSION
In response to the hypotheses posed in Bates et al.4 and reiterated in the Introduction,

we find:
‚Ä¢ The electrical potential is altered by the ionomer and the oxide layer primarily due
to dielectric effects of the immobile charges and their interplay with the mobile ones,
as observed in Fig. 7 and Fig. 10. A significant concentration of positive charge from
the ionomer lies near the surface of the electrode, as can be inferred from Fig. 8 and
Fig. 11.
‚Ä¢ The ionomer N+ are coordinated with both OH‚àí and H2 O. Fig. 9 and Fig. 12 indicate
that solvation and hence the location of the OHP is changing with electrode bias
voltage and depending on the solvating species ranges from 3 AÃä off the electrode
surface to 15 AÃä. A region depleted of OH‚àí forms near the electrode with electrical
19

bias and grows with increased bias. Since the N+ are relatively immobile, there are
significant N+ atoms in the depletion region, but these N+ remain coordinated with
water.
‚Ä¢ On the surface of the electrode, refer to Fig. 3, the N+ in the ionomer apparently displaces water and disrupts the tendency of the water to form ordered surface structures
like rings, as in Ref. 32. From Fig. 8 and Fig. 11 is it clear that significant concentration
of the ionomer N+ lie near the electrode surface.
‚Ä¢ The water molecules near the electrode surface orient in the manner dictated by the
electric field (with O further away from the surface) in a mixture of either one or both
hydrogens associated with surface atoms; however, in the surfaces with an oxide layer
the primary association is with a surface oxygen and the configuration where one of
the H legs of the water molecule lies on the electrode surface seems to dominate, as
can be seen in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.
‚Ä¢ Approximately 40% of the bare metal surface is coordinated with water molecules and
this surface coverage almost doubles in areas covered by an oxide layer.
‚Ä¢ Nanoscale heterogeneity such as at the edge of a oxide region provides local configurations favorable for water adsorption, as evidenced by the regions of high water coverage
at the edge of the partially oxidized electrode in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. This qualitative
observation may corroborate how rough versus smooth electrodes exhibit qualitatively
different reactivity, see Ref. 27 (Sec. 3.1 and 4.2) and references therein.
‚Ä¢ The presence of a NiO monolayer apparently allows OH‚àí to remain near the electrode
at high negative surface charges, compare Fig. 8 and Fig. 11.
Although we are presently unable to simulate the relevant reactions at the necessary time(molecular diffusion) and length- (diffuse layer) scales, the fact that the reactions are fast
compared with the processes MD represents well gives us some confidence that the results
are representative of steady-state conditions. Also, the H2 produced at the HER electrode
is small and mobile, and not likely to affect the components of the electrolyte. If positive
ions are present e.g. K+ from dissolved KOH, they will likely absorb to the electrode surface
and hence screen the remainder of the electrolyte, having stronger effects on performance.

CONCLUSION

We were able to simulate and examine the HER electrode-ionomer electrolyte interface
with atomic detail using a combination of DFT and classical MD techniques. We observed
configuration changes in response to external bias and the oxide coverage of the electrode.
Information of this nature is relevant to the efficiency of the water splitting process. In
particular the concentration of the reactants, water, and the electric field at the interface
have a direct relation to H2 production.
In future work, we will explore in more detail the effect of surface roughness/nanostructuring and the presence of other phases, such as Cr2 O3 , on the HER electrode. Resolution of the dielectric field55 may also shed light on the operation of these types of water
splitting cells and give rise to more accurate and informative theories. Also, the entropic
changes due to changes in pH discussed in Ref. 56 are likely correlated with structural characterizations presented in this work, such as the spatial variation of radial distributions, and
are another topic for potential future work.
