Abstract
Let Λ be a simply laced root lattice and w an elliptic automorphism of Λ of order d. This
paper gives a construction that begins with a central extension of the group of coinvariants Λw
and produces a semisimple Lie algebra of Dykin type Λ with an automorphism of order d lifting
w. The input for this construction naturally arises when considering certain families of algebraic
curves. The construction generalizes one used by Thorne to study plane quartics and one used by
the author and Thorne to study a family of genus-2 curves.

Introduction

Graded Lie algebras are a key source of coregular representations and thus have become important for
recent developments in arithmetic statistics (see, e.g., [Gro11], [Tho13], [Tho16], [RT18], [RT]). In this
paper, I give a general construction that begins with a central extension of a certain form and produces
a graded Lie algebra. This construction generalizes those of [Tho16] and [RT]. In both [Tho16] and
[RT], the construction was applied to appropriate Mumford-theta groups and allowed us associate
orbits in graded Lie algebras to points in quotients of the Jacobians of certain algebraic curves. The
present paper, while mainly algebraic in content, develops the generalized contruction as a tool for
further number-theoretic applications.
To explain the results in more detail, we let Λ be a simply laced root lattice, w an elliptic automorphism
of Λ of order d, and k a field of characteristic zero containing a primitive dth root of unity ζ. Let
1 → hζi → H → Λw → 1

(1.1)

be a central extension of the coinvariants of w, and let h·, ·i be the commutator pairing of H . Given
a bilinear pairing ε : Λ × Λ → k × that satisfies certain properties with respect to the pair (w, H ) (see
Section 2.1), I give a construction of a Lie algebra h over k as well as an order-d automorphism w
e of h
lifting w. The decomposition of h into eigenspaces for w
e gives h the structure of a graded Lie algebra.
As in [RT], the details of the construction of h are inspired by ideas from [Lur01] and [Lep85].

As an example of the input, for a fixed pair (Λ, w) as above, consider the pairing h·, ·iw : Λ × Λ → hζi
given by
Pd−1
j
hα, βiw = ζ j=1 j(w α,β)

for all α, β ∈ Λ, which appears in [Lep85]. Then hα, βiw gives a well-defined pairing on Λw , and there
exists a central extension of the form (1.1) with commutator pairing h·, ·iw . Then the pairing εw defined
by
d−1
Y
j
(1 − ζ −j )(w α,β)
εw (α, β) =
j=1

satisfies the properties required for the construction (see Section 3). We note that in examples coming
from algebraic geometry, the pairing h·, ·iw naturally arises as the Weil pairing on the d-torsion points
of the Jacobians of certain curves (see [RT], [Kul], and Section 6 below).
Further, in the case when the Lie algebra h is constructed using the pairing εw , there is a relationship
between the representation theory of H and that of the fixed-point subalgebra g = hwe : given a
representation (ρ, V ) of H over k such that ρ(ζ)v = ζv for all v ∈ V , there is a naturally associated
representation of g on V (see Theorem 4.4). The existence of such a representation in the case when
Λ is type E8 and d = 3 is an essential component of the proof of [RT, Theorem 3.7], in which we show
that H naturally embeds as a subgroup of a simply connected group with Lie algebra g.

1.1

Structure of the paper

The paper has the following structure. Section 2 gives the details of the construction of h and its
grading: in Section 2.1, we define an input datum as a quadruple (Λ, w, H , ε) of objects as described
2

above. In Section 2.2, given an input datum, we construct a Lie algebra h with Dynkin type given
by Λ. In Section 2.3, we show that the construction of h is functorial. Using this, in Section 2.4 we
construct an order-d automorphism w
e of h lifting w. In Section 2.5, we assume k/k0 is a finite Galois
extension and that Gal(k/k0 ) acts on the input datum for h via automorphisms. Assuming this action
has certain properties, we show that h and g descend to Lie algebras over k0 .
In Section 3, we start with a pair (Λ, w) and explicitly construct an input datum (Λ, w, H , εw ), where
H has commutator pairing h·, ·iw and εw is as defined above. In Section 4, we show that with input
datum as defined in Section 3, given a representation (ρ, V ) of H over k such that ρ(ζ)v = ζv for all
v ∈ V , there is an associated representation of g on V .
Section 5 contains some Lie-theoretic applications and examples. In particular, we show that the
construction of Section 2 gives an alternate proof that given a simple, simply laced Lie algebra s
with Cartan subalgebra t over an algebraically closed field, every elliptic automorphism of t lifts to
an automorphism of s of the same order. (This result was already proven in [AH17] using different
methods.) We also show that using the functoriality described in Section 2.3, we may use Section 2 to
construct simple Lie algebras of every Dynkin type. As an example of the Galois descent of Section
2.5, we show that we may use the construction to obtain a Lie algebra of type G2 over Q.
In Section 6, I show that the input for the construction of Section 2 naturally arises when considering
certain families of algebraic curves. These families have been studied previously (e.g. in [BS], [RS18],
[RT], [Kul]), but we put the relevant ideas into the setting of Section 2. We start with a semiuniversal
deformation S → B of a simple singularity of type E8 . For smooth fibers Sλ of this deformation,
Pic(Sλ ) is a root lattice of type E8 . There are automorphisms of S of orders 2, 3, and 5 corresponding
to elliptic automorphisms of the E8 root lattice. Given a smooth projective curve Cλ coming from
the fixed points of the automorphism of order d, the pairing h·, ·iw corresponds to the Weil pairing on
JCλ [d] where JCλ is the Jacobian of Cλ . We may then define central extensions of JCλ [d] that give
input datum as defined in Section 2.1.

1.2

Conventions and notation

In this paper, we consider a lattice Λ to be a finitely generated free Z-module with a symmetric
positive-definite bilinear form (·, ·) : Λ × Λ → Z. We say such a lattice Λ is a simply laced root lattice
if Λ is generated as a Z-module by {α ∈ Λ | (α, α) = 2}. If Λ is a simply laced root lattice, then
Φ := {α ∈ Λ | (α, α) = 2} forms a simply laced reduced root system in the Euclidean space Λ ⊗Z R,
and we call elements of Φ roots. If Λ and Λ′ are lattices with corresponding bilinear forms (·, ·) and (·, ·)′
respectively, then an isomorphism φ : Λ → Λ′ is a Z-linear bijection such that (φ(α), φ(β))′ = (α, β)
for all α, β ∈ Λ. Two simply laced root lattices are said to be isomorphic if they are isomorphic as
lattices. If Λ is simply laced root lattice, then given γ ∈ Λ, we let γ ∨ ∈ Λ∨ = Hom(Λ, Z) be defined by
γ ∨ (α) = (γ, α) for all α ∈ Λ.

Input data

Let Λ be a simply laced root lattice with associated bilinear form (·, ·) and Φ ⊂ Λ the subset of roots. We
assume that (·, ·) is normalized such that (α, α) = 2 for all roots α. Let w be an elliptic automorphism
of Λ of order d. (Recall that w is elliptic if and only if the group of coinvariants Λw := Λ/(1 − w)Λ is
finite.) Let k be a field of characteristic zero, and assume that k contains a primitive dth root of unity
ζ. Let
1 → hζi → H → Λw → 1

be a central extension, and let h·, ·i : Λw × Λw → hζi be its commutator pairing. Let Λ
e is a central extension
Then Λ
e→Λ→1
1 → hζi → Λ

with commutator pairing given by

Λ × Λ → Λw × Λw → hζi
where the first map is the natural projection and the second is the pairing h·, ·i. We continue to write
e for the preimage of Φ in Λ
e
h·, ·i for the commutator pairing on Λ without risk of confusion. Write Φ
e is a d-fold cover of Φ). Given α
e we write α for the image of α

following properties.
Lemma 2.1. The pairing h·, ·i has the following properties:
1. h·, ·i is bilinear in the sense that for all α, β, γ ∈ Λ,
hα, β + γi = hα, βihα, γi,
hα + β, γi = hα, γihβ, γi, and
hcα, βi = hα, cβi = hα, βic for all integers c.

3. α

Let ε : Λ × Λ → k × be a bilinear map (in the sense of Lemma 2.1). We say that the quadruple
(Λ, w, H , ε) is an input datum if it satisfies the following two properties:
1.

ε(α,β)
ε(β,α)

= −hβ, αi whenever (α, β) = −1.

2. ε(wα, wβ) = ε(α, β).
In Section 3.1, we describe an alternating pairing h·, ·iw on Λw previously defined in [Lep85] and [Ree11].
We then describe one choice for the pairing ε under the assumption that h·, ·iw is the commutator pairing
on H . We postpone this discussion because in many cases, for a fixed commutator pairing h·, ·i, more
than one pairing ε will satisfy the conditions required. For example, in [RT], we have d = 3 and take
ε(α, β) = (−1)(α,wβ) hα, βi, but the pairing εw in Section 3.3, which is given by (1−ζ)(α,wβ) (1−ζ 2 )(wα,β)
in the case d = 3, could be used in its place.

Construction of a Lie algebra

Assume that (Λ, w, H , ε) is an input datum as defined in the previous section. Let T be the split torus
over k with character group X ∗ (T ) = Homk (T, Gm ) equal to Λ, and let t = Lie T . We note that t may
be identified with Hom(Λ, k), and under this identification t is generated by {α∨ | α ∈ Φ}. Let l be
e modulo the relation Xζ αe = ζXαe for
the k-vector space generated by the set of symbols Xαe for α
e ∈ Φ,
e Thus l has dimension |Φ| as a vector space over k. Let h = t ⊕ l. We define a k-bilinear map
all α
e ∈ Φ.
[·, ·] : h × h → h by setting
[α∨ , Xβe] = −[Xβe, α∨ ] = (α, β)Xβe

if α + β = 0
if α + β ∈ Φ
otherwise.

It’s not hard to check that this map is well defined.

Theorem 2.2. With bracket [·, ·] as defined above, the vector space h forms a semisimple Lie algebra
over k with Cartan subalgebra t and corresponding root lattice Λ.
Proof. First note that [·, ·] is alternating. Indeed, if α + β = 0, then
[Xβe, Xαe ] = ε(β, α)βeα
eβ ∨ = −ε(β, α)βeα
eα∨ = −[Xαe , Xβe]

since α
eβe = βeα
e and ε(β, α) = ε(−α, α) = ε(α, β). And if α + β ∈ Φ, then

[Xβe, Xαe ] = ε(β, α)Xβeαe = ε(β, α)hβ, αiXαeβe = −[Xαe , Xβe]

by the first property of ε.
We next show that [·, ·] satisfies the Jacobi identity. We thus consider
[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]]

(2.2)

for generators x, y, z of h. If any two of x, y, z are elements of t, then it’s easy to see that (2.2) is zero.

of (2.2) are zero. If (β, γ) < 0, then (2.2) becomes
(α, β + γ)[y, z] − (α, γ)[y, z] − (α, β)[y, z],

which is also zero. Similarly, whenever one of x, y, z is in t, (2.2) is zero.

Thus we can asssume α + β + γ 6= 0. For (2.2) to be nonzero, then at least one of the three terms must
be nonzero. Without loss of generality we may assume [x, [y, z]] = [Xαe , [Xβe, Xeγ ]] 6= 0, so in particular
[Xβe, Xeγ ] 6= 0 and (β, γ) ∈ {−2, −1}. We break into two cases depending on the value of (β, γ).

If (α, β) ∈ {1, 2}, then (α, γ) = −(α, β), and (2.2) is equal to −[Xαe , [Xeγ , Xβe]] − [Xβe, [Xαe , Xeγ ]], which
is equal to zero by the cases just considered.
Case 2: (β, γ) = −1, i.e. β + γ ∈ Φ.
In this case, we have [Xαe , [Xβe, Xeγ ]] = ε(β, γ)[Xαe , Xβe]. Since α + β + γ 6= 0, for the first term (2.2)
to be nonzero we must have (α, β + γ) = −1. Thus the first term of (2.2) is ε(α, β + γ)ε(β, γ)Xαeβe
eγ =
ε(α, β)ε(α, γ)ε(β, γ)Xαeβe

Suppose (α, β) = −1. Then (α, γ) = 0 and (α + β, γ) = −1, and so (2.2) is equal to

by the first property of the pairing ε. If (α, γ) = −1, the proof is very similar. Otherwise we must have
(α, β) = −2 or (α, γ) = −2, and the proof reduces to that of Case 1.
Thus h forms a Lie algebra. It is not hard to show that the Killing form on h is nondegenerate and
that t is a maximal toral subalgebra. The result follows.
Note that in particular because the Cartan subalgebra t is split, the isomorphism class of h depends
only on Λ and not on w, H , or ε.

2.3

Functorality

The construction of h is functorial in the following sense. We define an isomorphism (Λ, w, H , ε) →
(Λ′ , w′ , H ′ , ε′ ) of input data to be a pair (ψ, φ) where
1. ψ : Λ → Λ′ is an isomorphism of simply laced root lattices such that ψw = w′ ψ and ε′ (ψ(α), ψ(β)) =
ε(α, β) for all α, β ∈ Λ.

Suppose (ψ, φ) is an isomorphism (Λ, w, H , ε) → (Λ′ , w′ , H ′ , ε′ ) of input data. Let h and h′ be the
Lie algebras obtained by using the input data (Λ, w, H , ε) and (Λ′ , w′ , H ′ , ε′ ), respectively, in the
construction of Section 2.2. Then (ψ, φ) naturally induces an isomorphism φe : h → h′ as follows: with

We next note that the grading behaves well under functorality. Let (ψ, φ) be an isomorphism of input
data (Λ, w, H , ε) → (Λ′ , w′ , H ′ , ε′ ), and let φe : h → h′ be the corresponding isomorphism of Lie
′
algebras as defined in Lemma 2.3. Let g = hwe and g′ = hwe .
Proposition 2.5. With notation as above, φe restricts to an isomorphism g → g′ of Lie algebras.
Further, for all j, φe restricts to an isomorphism of vector spaces hj → h′j intertwining the action of g
with the action of g′ .

e Indeed, if α ∈ Φ, we have that
Proof. We first claim that φew

The fact that φe restricts to an isomorphism hj → hj for all j follows easily. In particular, φe restricts
to an isomorphism of subalgebras g = h0 → h′0 = g′ . Because g and g′ act via restriction of the adjoint
representations of h and h′ respectively, the fact that φe intertwines the actions of g and g′ is equivalent
to the fact that φe is a Lie algebra isomorphism.

Remark 2.6. Applying Lemma 2.3 to the inner automorphisms of H , we obtain a natural homomorphism
ι : Λw → Aut(h).
e so ι is injective whenever h·, ·i is nonWe have that ι(λ)(Xαe ) = hλ, αiXαe for all λ ∈ Λw , α

Galois descent

For number-theoretic considerations, we are often interested in a more general version of the construction of the previous sections, in which we replace extensions of the form (1.1) with certain central
extensions of étale group schemes (see [Tho16], [RT]). In particular, we may consider a µd -extension of
JC [d], where JC is the Jacobian of a curve C defined over some number field not necessarily containing
a primitive dth root of unity (Section 6 below discusses central extensions of Jacobians further). Because of this, it becomes important to show that we may use the construction of the previous sections
to obtain Lie algebras over arbitrary fields of characteristic zero. The next proposition shows that
under certain conditions, this becomes possible with Galois descent.
Let k be as above, let (Λ, w, H , ε) be an input datum, and let h and g = hwe be the associated Lie
algebras as constructed above. Suppose k/k0 is a finite Galois extension, and let Γ = Gal(k/k0 ). Define
a homomorphism θ : hζi → Aut(Λ) by θ(ζ) = w. Suppose we are given homomorphisms Γ → Aut(Λ)
and Γ → Aut(H ) such that
A1. σθ(ζ i )σ −1 = θ(σ(ζ i )) in Aut(Λ) for all σ ∈ Γ and all i.
A2. The action of Γ on H restricts to the natural Galois action on hζi.
A3. The naturally induced homomorphisms Γ → Aut(Λ) → Aut(Λw ) and Γ → Aut(H ) → Aut(Λw )
are the same.
In this setting, the following proposition gives sufficient conditions to define forms of h and g over
k0 . We note that the two conditions of Proposition 2.7 are automatically satisfied in the case when
h·, ·i = h·, ·iw and ε = εw as defined in Section 3 (see Lemma 3.5).
Proposition 2.7. With notation as above, suppose the following two conditions hold for all σ ∈ Γ:
1. σ(hα, βi) = hσ(α), σ(β)i for all α, β ∈ Λ.
2. σ(ε(α, β)) = ε(σ(α), σ(β)) for all α, β ∈ Λ.
Then there is a natural semilinear action of Γ on h preserving g such that hΓ and gΓ are k0 -forms of
the Lie algebras h and g, respectively.
Proof. Because the Γ-actions on Λ and H induce the same action on Λw , these actions naturally
e Given σ ∈ Γ, define a σ-linear map aσ : h → h by aσ (α∨ ) = σ(α)∨ and
induce a Γ-action on Λ.

Note that if we define stacks in the same way as [RT, Section 3], then the proofs above would be enough
to define a morphism of stacks as in [RT, Theorem-Construction 3.1].

Bilinear pairings and central extensions

Let Λ be a simply laced root lattice, and let w ∈ Aut(Λ) be elliptic. In this section we show that given
Λ and w, we may explicitly realize an input datum as defined in Section 2.1.

3.1

The pairing h·, ·iw

We first describe a bilinear pairing on Λw . We begin with two pairings on Λ: the first, C, was defined
by Lepowsky in [Lep85, Section 4]; the second, h·, ·iw was defined by Reeder in [Ree11]1 and was shown
to factor through Λw × Λw . We will then show that these two pairings are the same.
The pairing C : Λ × Λ → k × of [Lep85] is defined by
C(α, β) = ζ (

Pd−1
j=1

jw j α,β)

.

Now let M (t) be the minimal polynomial of w. By [Ree11, Lemma 2.1], m := M (1) divides d; we will
d
. Let ζm = ζ d0 , which is a primitive mth root of unity. Let
write d0 for m
M0 (t) =

M (t) − M (1)
,
t−1

which is a polynomial over Z. Given α, β ∈ Λ, we set
(α,M0 (w)β)
hα, βiw = ζm
.

Note that hα, βiw depends only on the images of α and β, respectively, in Λw , and the pairing h·, ·iw
is alternating ([Ree11, Lemma 2.2]).
Lemma 3.1. We have that
hα, βiw = C(α, β)
for all α, β ∈ Λ.
′

Proof. Let g(t) = 1 + t + t2 + ... + td−1 , so that C(α, β) = ζ (wg (w)α,β) . We have g(t)(t − 1) = td − 1, so
g ′ (t)(t − 1) = dtd−1 − g(t),
and
tg ′ (t)(t − 1) = dtd − tg(t).
Plugging in w, we have wg ′ (w)(w − 1) = d. Since w − 1 is an invertible linear transformation of Λ ⊗Z R,
the inverse (w − 1)−1 is well defined, and we have
wg ′ (w) = d(w − 1)−1 .
1 Note that [Ree11] gives an additive version of this pairing, but we require the associated multiplicative pairing
described here.

10

Similarly, we have M0 (w)(w − 1) = −m, and M0 (w) = −m(w − 1)−1 . Thus we see that
wg ′ (w) = −d0 M0 (w).
Hence
C(α, β)

′

= ζ (wg (w)α,β)
−(M0 (w)α,β)
= ζm
= hβ, αi−1
w
= hα, βiw .

As a consequence, the pairing C factors through Λw × Λw . We will now drop the notation C and just
write h·, ·iw for the pairing of Lemma 3.1.

3.2

The existence of central extensions

We now review some of the theory of central extensions to show that there exists a central extension
of Λw by hζi with commutator pairing h·, ·iw . For a nice overview of this topic see [Pra], and for more
details see, e.g., [BT82, Chapter 1].
Isomorphism classes of central extensions
1 → hζi → E → Λw → 1
are parametrized by H 2 (Λw , hζi), where hζi is considered to be a trivial Λw -module. Recall that there
is a short exact sequence
0 → Ext1 (Λw , hζi) → H 2 (Λw , hζi) → Hom(∧2 Λw , hζi) → 0,
where we are taking Ext in the category of abelian groups, and ∧2 Λw = (Λw ⊗ Λw )/{x ⊗ x | x ∈ Λw }.
We may view the map H 2 (Λw , hζi) → Hom(∧2 Λw , hζi) as sending a central extension to its commutator
pairing. Thus because the bilinear pairing h·, ·iw : Λw × Λw → hζi is alternating, there exists a central
extension of Λw by hζi with commutator pairing given by h·, ·iw .
More explicitly, a cocycle c defines multiplication on the set hζi×Λw by (ζ i , α)·(ζ j , β) = (ζ i+j c(α, β), α+
β). With this definition, the inverse to (ζ i , α) is (ζ −1 c(−α, α)−1 c(0, 0)−1 , −α). Using these formulas,
it’s not hard to check that if a cocycle c is bilinear, the commutator pairing corresponding to c is given
by c(α, β)c(β, α)−1 .
As an example of a choice of c, write Λw as a direct produce of cyclic groups C1 × ... × Cn , and choose
a generator xi for each Ci . Define a cocyle on Λw by setting
(
hxi , xj iw if i < j
c(xi , xj ) =
1 if i ≥ j
and extending bilinearly. Then, using the fact that h·, ·iw is skew-symmetric, it is not hard to check
that c(α, β)c(β, α)−1 = hα, βiw for all α, β ∈ Λw .
Remark 3.2. Note that if (Λ, w, H , ε) is an input datum, then the commutator pairing on H is not
necessarily given by h·, ·iw . In fact, if Λ is a simply laced root lattice and w ∈ Aut(Λ) has odd order,
then given any alternating pairing h·, ·i on Λw , there exists an input datum (Λ, w, H , ε) such that H
has commutator pairing h·, ·i. Indeed, by the logic above, there exists a central extension H with
commutator pairing given by h·, ·i. If we define ε : Λ × Λ → k × by
ε(α, β) = (−1)(α,

then it’s not hard to check that (Λ, w, H , ε) is an input datum.

The pairing εw

We now define a pairing εw : Λ × Λ → k × satisfying the two conditions in the definition of an input
datum with respect to h·, ·iw . We note that this pairing appears in [Lep85, Section 4]. Let
εw (α, β) =

It is clear that εw (wα, wβ) = εw (α, β) for all α, β ∈ Λ. The following lemma, which is stated but not
proven in [Lep85, Section 4], shows that εw satisfies the necessary properties described in Section 2.1.
Lemma 3.3. We have

εw (α, β)
= (−1)(α,β) hβ, αiw
εw (β, α)

for all α, β ∈ Λ.
Proof. We have
εw (α, β)

Thus we see that if H is any central extension of Λw by hζi with commutator pairing h·, ·iw , then
(Λ, w, H , εw ) is an input datum. We next note that an input datum of this form behaves well with
respect to functorality and Galois descent (cf. sections 2.3 and 2.5).
Lemma 3.4. Suppose Λ and Λ′ are simply laced root lattices with elliptic automorphisms w and w′
respectively. If ψ : Λ → Λ′ is an isomorphism of root lattices such that ψw = w′ ψ, then
εw′ (ψ(α), ψ(β)) = εw (α, β)
for all α, β ∈ Λ.
Proof. This follows directly from definitions.
As mentioned earlier, the next result shows that h·, ·iw and εw satisfy the conditions of Proposition
2.7.
Lemma 3.5. With notation as in Section 2.5, suppose Γ acts on Λ such that σθ(ζ)σ −1 = θ(σ(ζ)) for
all σ ∈ Γ. Then
σ(hα, βiw ) = hσ(α), σ(β)iw
and
σ(εw (α, β)) = εw (σ(α), σ(β))
for all α, β ∈ Λ, σ ∈ Γ.

Proof. Suppose σ(ζ) = ζ n , and let n−1 denote the inverse of n in (Z/dZ)× . Then
σ(hα, βiw ) =

On representations of H

Section 4 will relate the representations of the fixed-point subalgebra g to the representations of H ,
so for completeness, we recall here some facts about representation theory of H . In this subsection,
Λ, w, and ζ are as above, and H may be any central extension of Λw by hζi. Let K be an algebraically
closed field containing k, let Z be the center of H , and let A be a maximal abelian subgroup of H .
The following proposition summarizes some well-known properties.
Proposition 3.6. Let χ : Z → K × be a character of Z that restricts to the natural inclusion hζi ֒→
K × , and let χ
e be any extension of χ to A. Then
1. IndH
e is an irreducible representation on which hζi acts via its defining character.

2. If χ′ : Z → K × is a character restricting to the inclusion hζi ֒→ K × and χ
e′ is an extension of

χ to A, then IndA χ
e ≃ IndA χ

3. Every irreducible representation of H over K on which hζi acts by its defining character is
isomorphic to one of the form IndH
e for some χ as above.
A χ

Proof. The fact that hζi acts via its defining character follows from the definition of an induced
representation. An easy exercise in Mackey theory shows that IndH
e is irreducible, and that if
A χ
χ′ : Z → k × is as in part 2 of the proposition, then IndH
e ≃ IndH
e′ implies χ = χ′ . Now given
A χ
A χ
an irreducible representation V on which hζi acts by its defining character, choose a character χ
e of A
such that HomA (e
χ, V ) 6= 0. Then by Frobenius reciprocity, we have IndH
e≃V.
A χ

Representations of the fixed-point subalgebra

Let (Λ, w, H , εw ) be an input datum containing εw as defined in Section 3.3. Let h and g = hwe be
the corresponding Lie algebras resulting from the construction of Section 2, and let K be any field
extension of k. In this section we show that every representation of H over K on which hζi acts by
its defining character may be used to define a representation of g.
It will be helpful to introduce the following notation. Given α, β ∈ Φ and c ∈ {0, ±1, ±2}, let
Iα,β (c) = {j ∈ {0, . . . , d − 1} | (wj α, β) = c}.
We begin with a technical result, Proposition 4.1, that will play a key role in the proof of Theorem
4.4. Proposition 4.1 follows from [Lep85, Proposition 4.1], but I have been unable to find a proof of it
in the literature. Thus for completeness, I include a proof here.

We now show that the right-hand side of (4.1) is also equal to (4.2). Note that for all i ∈ {0, ..., d − 1},
we have P (ζ i ) = 0 if and only if (wi α, β) ≥ 0. If i ∈ Iα,β (−1), then

Thus the right-hand side of (4.1) is also equal to (4.2) and we have proved the proposition.

We now consider g. Recall that given α
e ∈ Φ,

Zαe = Xαe + Xwαe + ... + Xwd−1 αe .

e we have
Lemma 4.3. Given α
e, βe ∈ Φ,

[Zαe , Zβe] =

Finally, if (wj α, β) = −1, then

[Xwj αe , Xβe] + [Xwj+1 αe , Xwβe] + · · · + [Xwj−1 αe , Xwd−1 βe] = εw (wj α, β)Zwj αeβe.
The result follows.
We now turn to representations of H . Let (ρ, V ) be a representation of H over K such that ρ(ζ)v = ζv
e = Λ ×Λw H → H be
for all v ∈ V . Define a linear transformation ρ̃ : g → gl(V ) as follows: let π : Λ
the canonical projection. Define ρ̃ by setting
ρ̃(Zαe ) = ρ(π(e
α))

e Then ρ̃ is well defined because π(wj α
for all α
e ∈ Φ.
e) = π(e
α) for all j and α
e, and because ρ(ζ) is scalar
multiplication by ζ.

Theorem 4.4. The map ρ̃ : g → gl(V ) is a Lie algebra homomorphism; i.e. ρ̃ defines a representation
of g on V .
Proof. It suffices to show that
ρ̃([Zαe , Zβe]) = [ρ̃(Zαe ), ρ̃(Zβe)]

(4.3)

e We break into three cases.
for all α
e, βe ∈ Φ.

Case 1: (α, wi β) = 2 for some i.

Replacing β by wi β, we may assume i = 0. Then α = β, so βe = ζ n α
e for some n. Since Zβe = ζ n Zαe , we
see that the left-hand side of (4.3) is zero. The right-hand side is
e − ρ(π(β)π(e
e α))
ρ(π(e
α)π(β))

= ρ(ζ n π(e
α)2 ) − ρ(ζ n π(e
α)2 )
= 0.

15

For the rest of the proof we assume that (α, wi β) 6= 2 for all i.
Case 2: (α, wi β) = −2 for some i.
By the same logic as above, we may assume i = 0. We have that β = −α and βe = ζ n α
e−1 for some n.
e
Thus π(e
α)π(β) ∈ µd , making the right-hand side of (4.3) zero. To see that the left-hand side of (4.3)
is zero, by Lemma 4.3, it suffices to show that
X
e
εw (wj α, β)ρ(π(wj α

j∈Iα,β (−1)

is zero. First note that

d

∈
/ Iα,β (−1). Indeed, since α + wα + w2 α + ... + wd−1 α = 0, we have
(α, wα + w2 α + ... + wd−1 α) = −2.

If d is even, this equation becomes
d

d

−2 = 2(α, wα + w2 α + ... + w 2 −1 α) + (α, w 2 α),
d

which implies that (α, w 2 α) ∈ 2Z.
Next note that if (wj α, β) = −1, then (wd−j α, β) = (α, wj β) = (wj α, β) = −1 since α = −β. Thus it
suffices to show that if j ∈ Iα,β (−1), then
e + εw (wd−j α, β)ρ(π(wd−j α
e
εw (wj α, β)ρ(π(wj α

eβ))

(4.4)

is zero. Fix j ∈ Iα,β (−1). Note that since α = −β, we have

εw (wd−j α, β) = εw (β, wj α) = −hwj α, βiw εw (wj α, β) = −εw (wj α, β).
Since π(e
α) = π(wi α
e) for all i, we see that (4.4) is zero as claimed.
Case 3: (wi α, β) ∈ {0, ±1} for all i.

Note that if (wi α, β) = 0 for all i, then hα, βiw = 1, and so α
e, βe commute. Thus both sides of (4.3)
2
are zero. Otherwise (considering the equation (α + wα + w α + ... + wd−1 α, β) = 0) there exists i such
that (wi α, β) = −1, and again we can assume i = 0. Thus the left-hand side of (4.3) is

Now suppose K = k and that we are in the setting of Proposition 2.7, so in particular Γ = Gal(k/k0 )
is acting on H . If V = V0 ⊗k0 k for some vector space V0 over k0 such that ρ : H → GL(V ) is Γequivariant for the induced action of Γ on GL(V ), then it’s not hard to see that ρe is also Γ-equivariant
and thus gives a representation of gΓ on V0 .
Remark 4.5. Let H be the split, simply connected group over k with Lie algebra h. The automorphism
w
e of h induces an order-d automorphism, call it θ, of H. Let G = H θ be the fixed-point subgroup,
which is a connected reductive group with Lie algebra g ([Ste68, Theorem 8.1]). Let Gsc be the simply
connected cover of G. Analogues of Theorem 4.4 have been used in special cases to construct an
embedding H ֒→ Gsc lifting the map Λw → Aut(g) described in Remark 2.6 (see [Tho16, Section A1]
and [RT, Theorem 3.7]). It is unclear whether such embeddings exist in the general case, but it seems
likely that Theorem 4.4 should allow for the construction of such embeddings in many examples. For
a new example of this kind, see Section 6.

Some Lie-theoretic applications
On simply laced Lie algebras and lifts of automorphisms

The following two propositions are not new results, but we point them out as general applications of
the construction above.
Proposition 5.1 ([Lur01]). For every simply laced root lattice Λ, Theorem 2.2 may be used to construct
a simple Lie algebra of Dynkin type Λ over Z.
Proof. Let Λ be a simply laced root lattice corresponding to an irreducible root system. When w = −1,
we have Λw = Λ/2Λ and hα, βiw = (−1)(α,β) for all α, β ∈ Λw . Given a central extension H with
commutator pairing hα, βiw , we may take ε to be trivial to obtain an input datum (Λ, w, H , ε). With
this input datum, the construction of Section 2.2 reduces to the construction of [Lur01, Section 3.1].
As already noted in [Lur01], we thus obtain a canonical construction of a simple, simply laced Lie
algebra over Z with root lattice Λ.
The next proposition was proven in more generality in [AH17] using very different techniques; we state
it here as an easy application of the results above.
Proposition 5.2. Let s be a simple, simply laced Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field K
of characteristic zero with Cartan subalgebra t and corresponding root lattice Λ. Then every elliptic
automorphism w of Λ lifts to an automorphism of s of the same order as w.
Proof. Let w ∈ Aut(Λ) be an elliptic automorphism of order d. By the considerations of Section 3,
we may extend the pair (Λ, w) to an input datum (Λ, w, H , ε) and may use Section 2.2 to produce
a Lie algebra h with Cartan subalgebra t = Hom(Λ, K). By Proposition 2.4, we obtain an order-d
automorphism of h that restricts to w on t. We then use the fact that there exists an isomorphism
s → h that restricts to the identity on t to obtain the result.

5.2

On non-simply laced Lie algebras

Here we note combining Theorem 2.2 with Lemma 2.3 allows us to construct every simple, non-simply
laced Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero. We start with the following
lemma.
Lemma 5.3. Let Λ be a simply laced root lattice associated to an irreducible root system. Let c be a
Coxeter element of the Weyl group of Λ. Then h·, ·ic is trivial.
Proof. Let Λ0 = {γ ∈ Λ ⊗ R | (γ, α) ∈ Z for all α ∈ Λ} be the weight lattice associated to Λ. By
[Ree11, Lemma 2.3], it suffices to show that Λ ⊂ (1 − c)Λ0 . Note that [Λ0 : (1 − c)Λ0 ] = |det(1 − c)| =
[Λ0 : Λ], and that (1 − c)Λ0 ⊂ Λ (see [Bou02, VI.1 Exercise 22]). Thus we have Λ = (1 − c)Λ0 , which
proves the lemma.
As a side note, it’s worth pointing out that even though h·, ·ic is trivial, εw does not seem to reduce to
a simpler form in the case when c = w.
Suppose Λ is type A2n+1 , Dℓ , or E6 , and let ϑ be an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of Λ. Note
that there exists a Coxeter element of the Weyl group of Λ that commutes with ϑ: for an example of
such an element when ϑ is nontrivial, see the table below. Let c be such an element, and let ϑ be the
automorphism of Λc induced by ϑ. Let h be the Coxeter number of Λ, and let ζ be a root of unity of
order h in K. Lemma 5.3 implies that the direct product Hc := hζi × Λc is a central extension with
commutator pairing h·, ·ic .
Define φ ∈ Aut(Hc ) by φ((ζ i , α)) = (ζ i , ϑ(α)). By Lemma 3.4, (ϑ, φ) is an isomorphism of the input
datum (Λ, c, Hc , εc ). We may use this input datum to obtain a Lie algebra h over Q(ζ). Define
17

e
φe ∈ Aut(h) as in Lemma 2.3. Then φe is a pinned automorphism, and hφ is a semisimple Lie algebra
with root system as listed in the table below.

In each case, the table lists the type of the root lattice Λ, a labeling of the Dynkin diagram for Λ with
a set of simple roots {α1 , . . . αℓ }, a choice of Coxeter element c, the order of the automorphism ϑ of the
e
Dynkin diagram, and the Dynkin type of the resulting fixed-point Lie algebra hφ . We write wi for the
simple reflection corresponding to αi . We note that in the case when |ϑ| = 3, the order of ϑ doesn’t pin
down a unique automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of D4 , but any choice of order-3 automorphism
will work in the construction.

Example: A Q-form of G2
e

In each case described in the table above, the resulting Lie algebra hφ is defined over Q(ζ), but in some
e
e
cases we may define an action of Γ := Gal(Q(ζ)/Q) on hφ and use Proposition 2.7 to show that (hφ )Γ
e
is a Lie algebra over Q. As an example, we show that we can do this when hφ is of type G2 .
Let Λ be type D4 ; let ϑ be a pinned automorphism of order 3, and let c be the Coxeter element defined
in the table for this case. Then c has order 6, so ζ is a primitive sixth root of unity. Define Hc , φ, and
φe as above, and let h be the Lie algebra over Q(ζ) resulting from the input datum (Λ, c, Hc , εc ). Let
σ be the nontrivial element of Γ. Then Γ acts on Λ via σ · λ = w2 (λ) for all λ ∈ Λ, where w2 is the
simple reflection corresponding to the simple root α2 , as defined above. We note that σcσ −1 = c−1 .
Define an action of Γ on Hc by letting Γ act on hζi via its natural action on Q(ζ) and by letting Γ act
on Λc via its action on Λ. By Lemma 3.5, the action of Γ satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.7.
Thus defining a Γ-action on h as in the proof of Proposition 2.7, we see that hΓ is a Lie algebra over Q.
Lemma 5.4. The isomorphism φe : h → h is equivariant for the action of Γ on h.
Proof. Note that w2 ϑ = ϑw2 . Thus for α ∈ Λ, we have

Examples from a simple singularity of type E8

We finish the paper by showing how input data as defined in Section 2.1 naturally arise in a collection
of examples coming from a simple singularity of type E8 . If Λ is a root lattice of type E8 , then for each
d ∈ {2, 3, 5}, there is a unique conjugacy class in Aut(Λ) of elliptic elements of order d (see [Ree11, Table
1]). For each of these choices of d, there is a naturally occurring family of curves, and in each case
we obtain a central extension of the form (1.1). We note that in each case, these families of curves
have been previously studied, but we summarize some known results here to put our construction into
context. For ease of exposition, we work over an algebraically closed field. For much of the background
about elliptic surfaces related to this section see, e.g., [Shi91] and [SS10].
Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and consider the surface S0 over K defined
by X 5 +Y 3 +Z 2 = 0, which is a simple singularity of type E8 . We may form a semiuniversal deformation
S → B := A8K of this singularity with fibers of the form
X 5 + Y 3 + Z 2 + Y (c2 X 3 + c8 X 2 + c14 X + c20 ) + c12 X 3 + c18 X 2 + c24 X + c30 = 0

(6.1)

(see, e.g., [Slo80, Section 2.4]). For each λ ∈ B, we write Sλ for the fiber over λ, and we write B s for
the locus over which Sλ is smooth, which is the complement of a hypersurface in B. For each λ ∈ B s ,
we may compactify to form an elliptic surface, call it Sλ , over P1K , where the morphism Sλ → P1K is
given by the X coordinate. As discussed in [RT, Section 4.4], Pic(Sλ ) is an E8 -root lattice.
For d ∈ {2, 3, 5}, let ζd ∈ K be a root of unity of order d. For each of these d, there is an order-d
automorphism of S0 given by
(X, Y, Z) 7→ (X, Y, −Z) (d = 2)
(X, Y, Z) 7→ (X, ζ3 Y, Z) (d = 3)
(X, Y, Z) 7→ (ζ5 X, Y, Z) (d = 5).
For each d, this map extends to an automorphism, call it θd , of S given by the same formula, inducing a
µd -action on S . If we define a µd -action on B by ζd · ci = ζdi ci , then the map S → B is µd -equivariant.
The fibers over the fixed points B µd are of the form:
X 5 + Y 3 + Z 2 + Y (c2 X 3 + c8 X 2 + c14 X + c20 ) + c12 X 3 + c18 X 2 + c24 X + c30 = 0 (d = 2)
X 5 + Y 3 + Z 2 + c12 X 3 + c18 X 2 + c24 X + c30 = 0 (d = 3)
X 5 + Y 3 + Z 2 + c20 Y + c30 = 0 (d = 5).
If λ ∈ B s,µd , then θd restricts to an automorphism of Sλ .
Lemma 6.1. If λ ∈ B s,µd , the automorphism of Pic(Sλ ) induced by θd is elliptic.

19

Proof. As in [RT, Section 4.4], we identify Pic(Sλ ) with the orthogonal complement in Pic(Sλ ) of
the Z-module generated by the zero section and the fiber above X = ∞. If we think of the equation
(6.1) defining Sλ as defining an elliptic curve Eλ over the field K(X), then by the same logic as in
[Shi91, Proposition 1.3], we have that the Mordell–Weil group Eλ (K(X)) is also isomorphic to a root
lattice of type E8 . By [SS19, Lemma 4.4], the natural surjective map Div(Sλ ) → Eλ (K(X)) (see, e.g.,
[SS19, Section 6.3]) factors through Pic(Sλ ), and by considering the kernel of this map [SS19, (6.4)],
we see that it induces an isomorphism of lattices
Pic(Sλ ) ֒→ Pic(Sλ ) → E(K(X)).
Thus we may think of nontrivial elements of Pic(Sλ ) as pairs (Y, Z) = (a(X), b(X)) of elements of the
field K(X) satisfying equation (6.1).
Case 1: d = 2.
The automorphism induced by θ2 maps (a(X), b(X)) to (a(X), −b(X)), so (a(X), b(X)) is fixed if and
only if b(X) = 0. Suppose (a(X), b(X)) is fixed. Then a(X) satisfies
X 5 + (a(X))3 + a(X)(c2 X 3 + c8 X 2 + c14 X + c20 ) + c12 X 3 + c18 X 2 + c24 X + c30 = 0.
For this to happen, (a(X))3 + a(X)(c2 X 3 + c8 X 2 + c14 X + c20 ) must be a degree-5 polynomial, call it
(X)
for polynomials a1 , a2 ∈ K[X] that have no common zeroes. We have that
q(x). Write a(X) = aa21 (X)
(a1 (X))3 + a1 (X)(a2 (X))2 (c2 X 3 + c8 X 2 + c14 X + c20 ) = q(X)a2 (X)3 ,

(6.2)

so
(a1 (X))3 = (a2 (X))2 (q(X)a2 (X) − a1 (X)(c2 X 3 + c8 X 2 + c14 X + c20 )),
which, since a1 and a2 have no common zeroes, implies that a2 ∈ K and a(X) is itself a polynomial.
Now (6.2) tells us that deg(a1 ) ≤ 1, but this contradicts the fact that (a(X))3 + a(X)(c2 X 3 + c8 X 2 +
c14 X + c20 ) has degree 5.
Case 2: d = 3.
Similarly, if (a(X), b(X)) is fixed, then a(X) = 0 and b(X) must satisfy
X 5 + (b(X))2 + c12 X 3 + c18 X 2 + c24 X + c30 = 0.
Using similar logic to the above, we see that b(X) is a polynomial. We have a contradiction because
the degree of b(X)2 is even.
Case 3: d = 5.
The automorphism group of Pic(Sλ ), i.e. the Weyl group of E8 , contains two conjugacy classes of
elements of order 5 (corresponding to diagrams A4 and A24 in [Car72, Table 11]): one consists of elliptic
elements and one does not. Let w ∈ Aut(Pic(Sλ )) be the automorphism induced by θ5 . If w is not
elliptic, then by finding an explicit conjugacy-class representative, we see that w must fix a root in
Pic(Sλ ). (For example, with simple roots as in the diagram below and notation for simple refections
as in Section 5.2, we may use that w is conjugate to w8 w7 w6 w5 .)

As in [Shi91, Proposition 1.4] or [Shi89, Lemma 3.1], the roots of E8 are given by pairs (a(X), b(X))
where a(X) is a polynomial of degree at most 2 and b(X) is a polynomial of degree at most 3. The
automorphism w maps (a(X), b(X)) to (a(ζ5 X), b(ζ5 X)). Thus if a root (a(X), b(X)) is fixed, then
a(X) and b(X) must each be constant. But (a(X), b(X)) must satisfy
X 5 + a(X)3 + b(X)2 + c20 b(X) + c30 = 0,
20

a contradiction.
From now on, given d ∈ {2, 3, 5}, we write wd ∈ Aut(Pic(Sλ )) for the automorphism of Lemma 6.1.
Given d and given λ ∈ B s,µd , let Cλ denote the fixed-point curve of θd in Sλ . Then Cλ is given by the
following equation, depending on d:
X 5 + Y 3 + Y (c2 X 3 + c8 X 2 + c14 X + c20 ) + c12 X 3 + c18 X 2 + c24 X + c30 = 0 (d = 2)
X 5 + Z 2 + c12 X 3 + c18 X 2 + c24 X + c30 = 0 (d = 3)
Y 3 + Z 2 + c20 Y + c30 = 0 (d = 5).
In the case d = 2, let Cλ be the compactification of Cλ as in [Tho13, Lemma 4.9], and in the other two
cases, take the projective completion of Cλ to yield a smooth projective curve Cλ . In each case, there
exists an isomorphism Pic(Sλ )wd → Pic0 (Cλ )[d] intertwining the pairing h·, ·iwd with the Weil paring
(see [Zar08, Theorem 2.10] for d = 2 and [RT, Proposition 4.15] for d = 3; for d = 5 this follows from
the fact that the groups in question are isomorphic to (Z/5Z)2 [Ree11, Table 1], which has a unique
non-degenerate alternating pairing (Z/5Z)2 × (Z/5Z)2 → hζ5 i up to choice of a primitive fifth root of
unity). We now recall that in each case, we may define a central extension of JCλ [d] whose commutator
pairing is given by the Weil pairing, and we may use this central extention to form an input datum.
Case 1: d = 2.
In this case, [Tho16, Section 1C] shows that given a theta characteristic κ on Cλ , we may naturally
associate a central extension
1 → µ2 → Hκ → JCλ [2] → 1
with commutator pairing given by the Weil pairing. The special case of the construction of Section
2 described in [Tho16] thus gives a 2-graded Lie algebra of type E8 . By [Tho16, Theorem 2.1], if Cλ
is defined over a subfield of K, then so is the corresponding Lie algebra. We note that the 2-Selmer
sets of this family of curves over Q were studied in [RT18] by analyzing a Lie algebra of this kind, and
that the construction of [Tho16] was recently used in [Kul] in a similar setting to study Jacobians of a
larger class of genus-4 curves.
Case 2: d = 3.
In [RT, Section 4.2] by considering the 3-torsion subgroup of an appropriately chosen Mumford-theta
group, we obtain a central extension
1 → µ3 → G → JCλ [3] → 1
with commutator pairing given by the Weil pairing. Thus we may use Section 2 to construct a 3graded Lie algebra of type E8 . A graded Lie algebra of this form was used in both [RT] and [RS18]
to study the 3-Selmer groups of smooth curves of the form Cλ over Q. If we let ε be given by
ε(α, β) = (−1)(α,wβ) hα, βiw3 in our input datum, then we recover the construction used in [RT], and
in this case if Cλ is defined over a subfield of K, then so is the corresponding Lie algebra.
Case 3: d = 5.
In this case Cλ is an elliptic curve. We may construct a Mumford-theta group as in [CFO+ 08, Section
1.6], obtaining a central extension
1 → Gm → G → Cλ [5] → 1
with commutator pairing given by the Weil pairing. The 5-torsion subgroup G [5] of G is a central
extension
1 → µ5 → G [5] → Cλ [5] → 1.
We have that (Pic(Sλ ), w5 , G [5](K), εw5 ) is an input datum, with εw5 as defined in Section 3.3. Let
h be the resulting Lie algebra and let w
e5 ∈ Aut(h) be the resulting automorphism. Then h is a Lie
algebra of type E8 with 5-grading given by w
e5 . As discussed in [Gro11], this 5-grading of E8 gives
precisely the representation studied in [BS] to determine the average size of the 5-Selmer group for
elliptic curves over Q.
21

Note that if Cλ is an elliptic curve over Q, we may choose a finite extension k/Q such that Cλ [5](k) =
Cλ [5](K) and such that Eλ (k(X)) contains all 240 roots of E8 , which implies Eλ (k(X)) = Eλ (K(X)).
We then obtain a Lie algebra h over k. The Galois group Gal(k/Q) naturally acts on Eλ (k(X)),
and it’s not hard to see that the action satisfies A1 of Section 2.5. Thinking of G as a subgroup of
GL5 as in [CFO+ 08, Section 1.6], we see that the natural action of Gal(k/Q) on G [5](k) ⊂ GL5 (k)
restricts to the natural action of Gal(k/Q) on hζ5 i, yielding A2 from Section 2.5. If the isomorphism
E(k(X))w5 → Cλ [5](k) intertwining h·, ·iw5 with the Weil pairing is equivariant for the action of
Gal(k/Q), then by Proposition 2.7, h descends to a Lie algebra over Q.
Our final result for the d = 5 case is an application of Theorem 4.4 and a new example of the kind
discussed in Remark 4.5. The analogous result for d = 3 is [RT, Theorem 3.7], and a similar result
holds for d = 2 by [Tho16, Proposition A.2]. Let h be the Lie algebra resulting from the input datum
f5 ∈ Aut(h) be the lift of w5 as defined in Section 2.4, and let g = hwe5 .
(Pic(Sλ ), w5 , G [5](K), εw5 ), let w
Let H = Aut(h), which is a connected reductive group of type E8 with maximal torus T as defined in
Section 2.2. The automorphism w
e5 ∈ H induces an inner automorphism of H; denote the fixed-point
subgroup by G := H we5 . Then G is a semisimple connective reductive group ([Ste68, Theorem 8.1],
[RLYG12, Table 18]). Let Gsc denote the simply connected cover of G.
Let ι : Cλ [5] → H be the homomorphism of Remark 2.6, where we are identifying Cλ [5] with Pic(Sλ )w5 .
Using the explicit description of ι in Remark 2.6, it’s not hard to check that the image of ι commutes
with w
e5 , and thus lies in G. Since h·, ·iw5 is nondegenerate [Ree11, Lemma 2.3], ι is injective.
Proposition 6.2. There exists a commutative diagram

with exact rows, where ι is as defined in Remark 2.6.
Proof. The proof follows that of [RT, Theorem 3.7]. By [RLYG12, Table 18], we can check that G is
type A4 × A4 , and by the logic in [Ree10, Section 3.7], we see that the center of G has order 5. Thus
the kernel of the natural projection Gsc → G is isomorphic to µ5 . Let H denote the preimage of ι(Λw )
under the projection Gsc → G. We have a commutative diagram

[CFO+ 08, Section 1.6]. Let ρe : g → gl5 be the representation of g corresponding to ρ, given by Theorem
4.4. It’s easy to see that ρe is irreducible with image sl5 . Then ρe corresponds to a representation
ψ : Gsc → GL5 on which the center of Gsc acts by scalars. We obtain a projective representation
ψ : G → PGL5 .
We claim that ρ(λ) = ψ(ι(λ)) for all λ ∈ Cλ [5]. Fix λ ∈ Cλ [5]. Since the adjoint representation of
PGL5 is faithful, it suffices to show that Ad(ρ(λ))(x) = Ad(ψ(ι(λ)))(x) for all x ∈ sl5 , and since ρe has
22

image sl5 , we may assume that x = ρe(Zαe ) for some generator Zαe of g. We have

To complete the proof, it suffices to show that ρ(G [5]) = ψ(H ), since then ψ |H is injective and the
map (ψ |H )−1 ◦ ρ : G [5] → H gives the desired isomorphism of central extensions. Clearly ψ(H )
is in the preimage in GL5 of ρ(Cλ [5]), and ψ(H ) is 5-torsion, so ψ(H ) ⊂ ρ(G [5]). The image of
ψ(H ) in PGL5 is ρ(Cλ [5]), so the kernel of ψ |H is contained in µ5 . So it suffices to show that
µ5 ⊂ ψ(H ). But if not then ψ(H ) ≃ JCλ [5] and ψ(H ) is a maximal abelian subgroup of ρ(G [5]), so
µ5 = ρ(µ5 ) ⊂ ψ(H ), a contradiction.
