ABSTRACT
The late assembly of massive galaxies is thought to be dominated by stellar accretion in their outskirts
(beyond 2 effective radii Re ) due to dry, minor galaxy mergers. We use observations of 1010 passive
early-type galaxies (ETGs) within z < 0.15 from SDSS IV MaNGA to search for evidence of this
accretion. The outputs from the stellar population fitting codes FIREFLY, pPXF, and Prospector
are compared to control for systematic errors in stellar metallicity (Z) estimation. We find that
the average radial logZ/Z profiles of ETGs in various stellar mass (M∗ ) bins are not linear. As a
result, these profiles are poorly characterized by a single gradient value, explaining why weak trends
reported in previous work can be difficult to interpret. Instead, we examine the full radial extent of
stellar metallicity profiles and find them to flatten in the outskirts of M∗ & 1011 M ETGs. This is a
signature of stellar accretion. Based on a toy model for stellar metallicity profiles, we infer the ex-situ
stellar mass fraction in ETGs as a function of M∗ and galactocentric radius. We find that ex-situ stars
at R∼2Re make up 20% of the projected stellar mass of M∗ . 1010.5 M ETGs, rising up to 80% for
M∗ & 1011.5 M ETGs.

stars that formed within their host galaxies tend to
dominate at the center, whereas accreted stars begin to
do so in the outskirts (R∼2Re ; Rodriguez-Gomez et al.
2016) and in the lower surface brightness regions beyond
2Re known as stellar halos (Zolotov et al. 2009; Tissera
et al. 2013, 2014; Cooper et al. 2015). These stellar
populations of different origin are usually referred to
as in-situ and ex-situ, respectively. Several simulations
have made predictions about observational signatures
of the predicted radial transition from in-situ to ex-situ
(e.g. Pillepich et al. 2014). Among stellar population
tracers, stellar metallicity is expected to be one of the
most sensitive to this transition (e.g. Cook et al. 2016).
In the absence of late-time minor mergers, the radial
stellar metallicity profiles are predicted to be negative
(Kobayashi 2004; Pipino et al. 2010; Taylor & Kobayashi
2017). This implies that the outer parts of ETGs tend to
be more metal-poor than the inner parts. Albeit with
significant variance (Lackner et al. 2012; Hirschmann
et al. 2015), the deposition of accreted stars in the
outskirts of galaxies induces flattening of the in-situ
profile (Cook et al. 2016; Taylor & Kobayashi 2017).
Since mergers are expected to have a larger effect on
more massive systems, the resulting prediction is that
the stellar metallicity profiles of ETGs are flatter toward
higher M∗ , especially in the stellar halos (Cook et al.
2016).
These theoretical predictions have motivated the
search for observational signatures of stellar accretion. Using long-slit spectroscopy, Carollo et al. 1993
estimated the strength of metallicity-sensitive stellar
absorption features as a function of galactocentric
radius in 42 nearby galaxies. Though larger samples
can be studied using photometric surveys (e.g. La
Barbera et al. 2005, 2011; Tortora et al. 2010; Tortora
& Napolitano 2012), spectroscopy is critical for breaking
the age-metallicity degeneracy. More recently, studies
of stellar populations in nearby galaxies have benefited
from integral field unit (IFU) surveys like MASSIVE
(Greene et al. 2013, 2015), CALIFA (Sánchez et al.
2012), SAMI (Allen et al. 2015), and MaNGA (Mapping
Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory; Bundy
et al. 2015). In particular, MaNGA observations extend
to the outskirts of galaxies (beyond 2 Re ), starting to
probe the radii at which the signatures of minor mergers
are predicted to appear (e.g. Cook et al. 2016).
Stellar metallicity profiles are typically characterized
by radial gradients, estimated by fitting a linear form to
the profile between the center and 1-2Re (e.g. Zheng
et al. 2017; Goddard et al. 2017b; Li et al. 2018).
In agreement with simulations, the metallicity gradients of ETGs tend to be negative (e.g. Rawle et al.

2010; González Delgado et al. 2015; Roig et al. 2015).
However, the dependence of the gradient slope on M∗
remains unclear. Based on a sample of ∼ 103 galaxies
from the MaNGA survey, Zheng et al. (2017) find weak
or no correlation between the gradients and M∗ . Using
data from the same survey, Goddard et al. (2017a) find
that gradients are steeper with increasing M∗ , although
with low significance. Though also based on MaNGA,
Li et al. (2018) find shallower gradients at higher central
velocity dispersions (σ∗ > 100km/s). There are several
possible sources for these discrepancies, from stellar
population synthesis approach (see Conroy 2013) to
fitting method. Another important factor, as we show
in this paper, is that the stellar metallicity profiles of
ETGs are not well described by a linear fit.
In this work, we examine the full radial extent of
metallicity profiles from spatially resolved spectroscopy
of 1010 ETGs from MaNGA. We inform our interpretation of the stellar metallicity profiles by using results
from hydrodynamical simulations (e.g. Cook et al.
2016; Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016; D’Souza & Bell
2018). This paper is structured as follows. In Section
2 we define our sample. In Section 3, we describe
the stellar population fitting process with the codes
FIREFLY (Wilkinson et al. 2017), pPXF (Cappellari &
Emsellem 2004; Cappellari 2017), and Prospector (Leja
et al. 2017). We show our results in Section 4 and discuss
the implications in Section 5. We summarize in Section
6. This work adopts H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 and all
magnitudes are reported in the AB system (Oke & Gunn
1983).
2. DATASET

The MaNGA survey (Bundy et al. 2015; Yan et al.
2016a) is part of the fourth generation of SDSS (York
et al. 2000; Gunn et al. 2006; Blanton et al. 2017), and
is on track to provide spatially resolved spectra for ten
thousand nearby galaxies (z < 0.15) by the end of 2020.
By means of integral field unit spectroscopy (IFS; Smee
et al. 2013; Drory et al. 2015; Law et al. 2015), every
galaxy is observed with 19-to-127 fiber bundles with
diameters varying between 12.00 5 and 32.00 5. The resulting
radial coverage reaches between 1.5Re and 2.5Re for
most targets (Wake et al. 2017; see Figure 1). The
spectra cover the wavelength range 3600-10300 Å at a
resolution of R∼2000.
All MaNGA data used in this work were reduced
by the Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP; Law et al.
2016; Yan et al. 2016b). The reduced spectra have
a median spectral resolution of σ=72 km s−1 . The
data cubes typically reach a 10σ continuum surface
brightness of µ=23.5 mag arcsec−2 , and their astrometry

is measured to be accurate to 0.00 1 (Law et al. 2016).
De-projected distances and stellar kinematic maps have
been calculated by the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline
(DAP; Westfall et al. 2019). This work also makes use
of Marvin (Cherinka et al. 2017), the specially designed
tool for access and handling of MaNGA data1 .
This paper is based on the SDSS Data Release 15
(DR15), which consists of the observations of the first
4675 MaNGA targets. We extracted the stellar masses
(M∗ ), Sersic indices (nSersic ), and effective radii (Re )
of these galaxies from the publicly available NASASloan Atlas2 (NSA). In particular, the M∗ estimates
were derived using a k-correction fit to the Sersic fluxes
(Blanton & Roweis 2007), adopting the Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) stellar population models and a Chabrier
(2003) initial mass function (IMF). They also assumed
H0 = 100 km s−1 Mpc−1 , but we scaled them for an
H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 cosmology. The nSersic estimates
were obtained from one-component, two-dimensional fits
to r-band images. The Re are determined using an
elliptical Petrosian analysis of the r-band image from
the NSA. All NSA measurements use the detection and
deblending technique described in Blanton et al. (2011).
To select ETGs, we first applied the morphological
cut nSersic > 2.5 (e.g. Blanton et al. 2003, 2005; Peng
et al. 2010). In addition, we selected passive ETGs
by using the average Hα equivalent width across the
galaxy -EW(Hα)- as proxy for specific star-formation
rate (sSFR). The cut was EW(Hα) < 3 Å, which is
commonly used to distinguish between ionization due
to smooth background of hot evolved stars and due to

star formation and AGN (Cid Fernandes et al. 2011;
see also Belfiore et al. 2016). This yielded a sample
with 1101 galaxies. We also limited the central velocity
dispersions and stellar masses of our sample to the
ranges σ∗ < 400 km s−1 and 10 <logM/M∗ < 12,
respectively. We performed these cuts to provide a
relatively uniform distribution of ETGs over M∗ . The
final outcome was a sample of 1010 ETGs. We did
not remove quiescent galaxies with significant stellar
disks from the sample. From visual inspection, we
estimate the fraction of lenticulars (S0s) to be . 20
%. However, we acknowledge the challenge of achieving
precise S0 classification of SDSS galaxies (see Nair &
Abraham 2010). Our selection may also miss blue
ellipticals, but their number fraction is . 5% for our
M∗ range (Kannappan et al. 2009). Our goal here is to
study a generally passive sample of spheroidal galaxies.
We delay to future work a characterization of stellar
populations in more finely discriminated morphological
types.
3. METHODOLOGY

3.1. Radial binning
Using the Re value of every galaxy, we associated
elliptical polar radii to all spaxels in units of Re . These
account for the axis ratio of every object, which were
measured on the r-band photometry. We then binned
them into the five annuli R/Re = [0, 0.5], [0.5, 1], [1, 1.5],
[1.5, 2], and [2, 2.5]. This is shown for a sample galaxy
on the left panel of Figure 1.
After binning, we shifted every spectrum back to the
rest-frame using the stellar systemic velocity (v∗ ) maps
calculated by the DAP. We used the maps computed
with a Voronoi binning scheme that aims for a minimum

4

Oyarzún et al.

signal-to-noise ratio of 10 per bin. For each galaxy, we
co-added the spectra in every annular bin. We did not
convolve the spectra to a common σ∗ prior to stacking.
After co-addition, we ran pPXF (Cappellari & Emsellem
2004; Cappellari 2017) with the MILES Single Stellar
Population (SSP) library (Vazdekis et al. 2010) on the
stacked spectra to measure the co-added v∗ and σ∗ . The
right panel of Figure 1 shows the five co-added spectra
for a sample galaxy.

3.2. Stellar population fitting
Estimates of stellar population parameters like stellar
metallicity can be obtained by full spectral fitting, but
depend sensitively on the adopted priors, assumptions
used to generate template spectra (Conroy 2013), and
fitting method. To mitigate the effect of systematic
biases from any one approach, we applied three independent codes to the same data and examine the differences
that arise.
The first code we ran was the public version of FIREFLY34 (Comparat et al. 2017; Wilkinson et al. 2017;
Goddard et al. 2017a). This χ2 minimization code
decouples stellar populations from dust by removing the
low-order continuum shape before performing the model
fitting. Hence, it focuses on high frequency modes in
the spectra to infer stellar ages and metallicities. SSPs
of different ages and metallicities are added iteratively
until the improvement in χ2 is negligible.
We ran the code with the stellar population models
of Maraston & Strömbäck (2011), MILES stellar library (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006), and Chabrier IMF
(Chabrier 2003). We used a set of SSPs covering an age
grid between 6.5 Myr and 15 Gyr, while the sampled
stellar metallicities were logZ/Z =-2.3, -1.3, -0.3, 0.0,
and 0.3. The library spans the wavelength range 4000Å
to 7400Å. As shown in Wilkinson et al. 2017, FIREFLY
effectively recovers stellar population parameters for
spectra with S/N> 10 (see also Goddard et al. 2017b).
To limit the systematics in the measurements from
Firefly, we excluded any co-added spectra with S/N<
10. We also masked emission lines. Fitting with
FIREFLY took, on average, a minute per spectrum on
a single core. Throughout this paper, we show lightweighted measurements, although we find similar results
when using the mass-weighted counterparts.

4 https://github.com/FireflySpectra/firefly release

We also ran pPXF5 (Cappellari & Emsellem 2004;
Cappellari 2017) on our spectra. This code applies a
penalized maximum likelihood approach to fit libraries
of stellar population templates to observed data. Since
this code penalizes pixels that are not well characterized
by the templates, it minimizes template mismatch. We
ran it with the included library of SSPs based on the
MILES stellar library (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006;
Vazdekis et al. 2010).
We simultaneously fitted for the gas and the stars,
allowing for two moments in gas kinematics and four
in stellar kinematics. We chose not to smooth the
distribution of template weights (i.e., no regularization).
After the best linear combination of templates was
found, we added several realizations of the noise in the
spectra to the best fit. This allowed us to characterize
the uncertainties in the reported stellar population parameters. On average, our runs of pPXF took about a
minute per spectrum on a single core.
The third stellar population fitting code we ran was
Prospector6 (Leja et al. 2017). This code is based on
the stellar population synthesis code FSPS7 (Conroy
et al. 2009; Conroy & Gunn 2010), which generates
composite stellar spectra for a variety of prescriptions for
stellar population synthesis and evolution. This allows
Prospector to sample the posterior distribution of a userdefined parameter space, while formally characterizing
uncertainties and degeneracies. We chose the MILES
stellar library (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006), MIST
isochrones (Dotter 2016; Choi et al. 2016), and Kroupa
IMF (Kroupa 2001) as inputs. We also masked emission
lines prior to fitting.
Since we fitted old stellar populations, we modeled the
spectra with exponentially decaying (τ ) star-formation
histories to speed up the fitting process. In addition to τ ,
our parameter space included the optical depth of dust
in the V-band, and stellar ages, metallicities, masses,
and velocity dispersions. Our priors are shown in Table
1. To derive the posterior distributions, we used the
Dynamic Nested Sampling package dynesty8 (Speagle
2019). On average, convergence of Prospector with
dynesty was achieved after an hour per spectrum on a
single core.

4. RESULTS

Using the three codes described above, we derived
stellar population parameters in each radial bin for all
galaxies in the sample. After binning in M∗ (with
numbers in Table 2), we computed the average stellar
metallicity profiles as a function of M∗ and show them
in Figure 2. The three panels show the results from the
three fitting codes. While the metallicity profiles differ
in normalization and in their detailed shapes, qualitative
trends are similar across the codes.
We start by discussing the two notable discrepancies
among the outputs. First, pPXF systematically measures metallicities ∼ 0.1 dex lower than Firefly and
Prospector. This overall offset does not correlate with
S/N or M∗ and will not affect our primary conclusions,
which are based on the shape of derived metallicity profiles. Second, Firefly outputs tend to avoid metallicities
in the range logZ/Z = [−1.3, −0.3], preferring higher
values. This is presumably due to sampling in the stellar
metallicity grid (see Wilkinson et al. 2017). As we show
in Figure 2, flattening of the Firefly metallicity profiles
occurs at higher metallicities as a result.
In nearly all radial bins, more massive galaxies exhibit
more metal-rich stars. The logZ/Z profiles of ETGs
fall linearly with galactocentric radius out to 1.5Re .
Remarkably, the profiles flatten at the largest radii for
M∗ > 1011 M . The flattening is present in the output
of all three codes. Comparing a given set of profiles
as a function of M∗ , we see that the radius at which
this flattening occurs moves inward as M∗ increases.
These results are also apparent in the behavior of Lick
indices Fe4531, Mgb(5178), and Fe5270 (Appendix A).
The observed flattening is consistent with the signatures of stellar accretion predicted by hydrodynamical
simulations (e.g. Cook et al. 2016) and motivates the
interpretative framework we discuss in Section 5.
We note that even though the M∗ dependence of the
stellar metallicity profiles is consistent across codes, the
same cannot be said about the stellar age profiles (not
shown). This is not surprising, since it is extremely

5

difficult to determine the ages of stellar populations
older than 9 Gyr because of the slow isochrone evolution
at late times (Conroy 2013). Since radial gradients in
stellar age are not predicted to capture much information about the accretion history of ETGs (Cook et al.
2016), we leave a more detailed analysis of stellar ages
for future work.
Some galaxies only satisfied our quality criteria (see
Section 3) at some annuli. Hence, some galaxies contributed only to some regions in the profiles of Figure
2. To ensure our results are not biased, as a result we
constructed a subset of 822 ETGs composed only of high
quality spectra (S/N> 10 for all radii). Our results were
also recovered with this subset.
We have also attempted to reproduce our results
using the publicly available Firefly9 (Goddard et al.
2017a,b) and Pipe3D10 (Sánchez et al. 2016, 2018) Value
Added Catalogs, which provide spatially-resolved maps
of stellar population properties for MaNGA galaxies.
Unfortunately, Voronoi bins with S/N<10 dominate in
the outermost low-surface brightness regions. Various
tests have shown that stellar population codes are biased
at S/N<10 (e.g. Wilkinson et al. 2017). As a result
of these complications, we refrained from incorporating
these catalogs in our analysis.

5. DISCUSSION

5.1. On the radial metallicity profiles of ETGs
In the R<Re region, Martı́n-Navarro et al. (2018)
found that the stellar metallicity profiles of ETGs fall
more steeply at higher σ∗ and M∗ . Similarly, Goddard
et al. (2017a) reported weak evidence for a steepening of their radial gradients with M∗ . On the other
hand, Kuntschner et al. (2010); Tortora et al. (2010);
Kuntschner (2015); Li et al. (2018) found gradients to
flatten at higher σ∗ . González Delgado et al. (2015);
Zheng et al. (2017) claimed no clear correlation between
their stellar metallicity gradients and M∗ . Similarly,
Greene et al. (2013, 2015) found no strong correlations
between the shape of element abundance profiles and σ∗ .
In this work, we found the profiles to flatten in the outskirts for logM∗ /M & 11. Here, we demonstrate how
some of the apparent disagreement among observations
may owe to the definition of metallicity gradients.

a The decrease in number of spectra with radius is a consequence of IFU coverage and quality cuts on the
fits to stellar kinematics.

Figure 2. Median radial metallicity profiles of ETGs for different M∗ bins. The three panels show the profiles derived by the
codes Firefly, pPXF, and Prospector. The profiles of lower mass ETGs fall linearly with galactocentric radius. As galaxy mass
increases, the profiles flatten at R>1.5Re .

A quick look at our Figure 2 reveals that the average
metallicity profiles of ETGs are not straight lines. It
stands to reason that fitting lines to these radial profiles
could “wash-out” the flattening in the outskirts of high
M∗ ETGs. Figure 3 shows the outcome of fitting lines
to our metallicity profiles over different radial ranges
motivated by the literature. Some ranges trace the
inner regions (R<Re ; Li et al. 2018), while others have
more extended coverage (R<2Re ; Goddard et al. 2017a).
The scatter is considerable in all cases, and recovering
any correlations with M∗ is difficult. We conclude
that gradients are sensitive to radial coverage (see also
Greene et al. 2019) and can also miss important behavior
in the stellar metallicity profiles. Gradients should be
avoided when possible.
5.2. Comparison with hydrodynamical simulations
Hydrodynamical simulations predict stellar accretion
to induce gradient flattening (e.g. Cook et al. 2016). In
general, stars accreted via dry, minor mergers tend to
settle around and beyond the outskirts of ETGs (R=24Re ), which results in a flatter stellar metallicity profile

than the inherently steeper form it originally had. Since
mergers are expected to have a larger effect on more
massive systems, this prediction is in broad agreement
with our results from Figure 2.
A relevant point involves the radii at which accretion signatures are expected to appear. RodriguezGomez et al. (2016) derived the accreted mass fraction
of galaxies as a function of galactocentric radius in the
Illustris simulation (Vogelsberger et al. 2014a,b). On
average, this fraction increases with radius. It goes
from zero at the center to unity at radii R& 5Re . This
motivates the definition of the transition radius (RT ). It
is defined as the galactocentric radius at which the M∗
fraction of the ex-situ stellar component overtakes its
in-situ counterpart (D’Souza et al. 2014). RodriguezGomez et al. (2016) found RT to decrease with M∗ ,
going from RT ∼ 5Re at M∗ ∼ 1010 M to RT <Re at
M∗ ∼ 1012 M . Our results are qualitatively consistent
with this prediction.
However, there are some quantitative tensions. For
logM∗ /M ∼ 11 galaxies, Rodriguez-Gomez et al.
(2016) reported RT ∼ 4 Re . Within 2.5Re , we should

line to the radial profiles. From left to right, we fit the radial ranges R<2Re , 0.5Re <R<1.5Re , and R<1Re . The arrows indicate
gradients beyond the scale of the figure. Note how gradients fail to capture most of the high M∗ flattening seen in Figure 2.

only be probing accreted stellar mass fractions of .0.3
at this mass range. Cook et al. (2016), also based on
the Illustris simulation, reported that the flattening of
metallicity gradients with M∗ only becomes noticeable
in the stellar halo (R= 2 − 4Re ). Therefore, the
signatures we see in Figure 2 are apparent at smaller
radii than some simulations have predicted. There
are a few possible explanations for this tension. The
works of Rodriguez-Gomez et al. (2016); Cook et al.
(2016) were based on Illustris. Galaxies at z ∼ 0 from
the first generation of this simulation were found to
be larger by a factor of ∼ 2 than observed galaxies.
IllustrisTNG solved this problem, among others, by
improving the treatment of galactic winds, magnetic
fields, and black hole feedback (Pillepich et al. 2018;
Weinberger et al. 2017, 2018). The treatment of
these, among with other secular processes, can strongly
impact the stellar population gradients measured in
simulations (e.g. Taylor & Kobayashi 2017). On the
observational side, estimates of the ages and metallicities
of stellar populations can strongly depend on the choice
of stellar library, isochrones, and approach to fitting.
These systematic uncertainties also affect the conversion
between stellar mass and stellar light, impacting the
comparison between simulations and observations.
5.3. Estimating the ex-situ stellar mass fraction
Observationally, global stellar metallicity correlates
with M∗ or the central velocity dispersion σ∗ of galaxies
(Faber & Jackson 1976; Cid Fernandes et al. 2005;
Gallazzi et al. 2005; Thomas et al. 2005, 2010; González
Delgado et al. 2014), as would be expected if the deeper
potential wells of more massive systems limit the impact

of galactic winds (Matteucci 1994). In the Illustris
simulation, D’Souza & Bell (2018) found an accreted
Macc -Zacc relation, where Macc and Zacc refer to the
stellar mass and stellar metallicity of the accreted components, respectively. This relationship lies ∼ 0.3 dex
below the global counterpart. We can make informed
assumptions for the in-situ stellar metallicity profile and
the Macc -Zacc relation to build a toy model capable of
inferring the ex-situ M∗ fraction as a function of mass
and galactocentric radius from our observations.
We assume the intrinsic in-situ metallicity profiles of
ETGs to be well described by the profiles observed in
the low mass end of our sample. This is supported by
hydrodynamical simulations that find M∗ ∼ 1010 M
galaxies to be dominated by in-situ stars within the
radial coverage of our data (Rodriguez-Gomez et al.
2016). We take the M∗ = 1010 − 1010.5 M profiles from
Figure 2 for each code and refer to them as
logZobs (R, low M∗ )

(1)

In our model, the in-situ profiles of all galaxies follow
the shape of logZobs (R, low M∗ ) with a normalization
applied to match the metallicity at the center (i.e.
within 0.5 Re ). This can be written as
logZin-situ (R, M∗ ) = logZobs (R, low M∗ )

(2)

+logZobs (0.25Re , M∗ ) − logZobs (0.25Re , low M∗ )
with a schematic representation in Figure 4.
The Macc -Zacc relation is offset 0.3 dex from the global
counterpart in the Illustris simulation. The existence of
this relation originates from single massive progenitors
contributing to the bulk of the mass to the accreted

account for differences between codes, we set ε equal
to the difference in metallicity between the centers and
outskirts of M∗ = 1011.5 − 1012 M ETGs (see Figure 4).
The corresponding values are ε ∼ −0.14 (Firefly), −0.29
(pPXF), and −0.24 (Prospector).
We can now write observed metallicities as a linear
combination between in-situ and ex-situ metallicities:
logZobs (R, M∗ ) = fin-situ (R, M∗ ) logZin-situ (R, M∗ )
+fex-situ (R, M∗ ) logZex-situ (M∗ )

Figure 4. Top: Decomposition of the observed metallicity
profile (red data points) in the highest M∗ bin (1011.5 −
1012 M ). We ascribe the in-situ component in this mass
bin the same shape as the observed metallicity profile in
the lowest M∗ bin (1010 − 1010.5 M ), but scaled upward
to match the observed, central metallicity at higher M∗ .
The ex-situ component (grey) is ascribed a single metallicity
ε ∼ −0.24 lower than the observed central metallicity. The
mix of components lowers the observed metallicity at all
radii. Bottom: The amount of suppression determines the
required fraction of ex-situ stars at each radius. This figure
was made with the outputs from Prospector, but also applies
to Firefly and pPXF.

stellar component (D’Souza & Bell 2018). If we assume
the accreted envelopes of ETGs to be comparable in
stellar mass to their host ETG (e.g. Rodriguez-Gomez
et al. 2016), ex-situ metallicities can be approximated
by
logZex-situ (M∗ ) = logZobs (0.25Re , M∗ ) − ε

(3)

i.e., stellar metallicity of ex-situ stars will be ε = 0.3 dex
lower than the metallicity at the center of the galaxy.
Note that there is no dependence on galactocentric
radius in the definition of logZex .
For measured metallicities, the offset will be dependent on the stellar population synthesis approach. To

where fin-situ and fex-situ = 1 − fin-situ are the in-situ
and ex-situ fractions. Figure 4 describes our toy model
and how we derive ex-situ fractions from it.
The results as a function of M∗ , galactocentric radius,
and code are shown in Figure 5. Ex-situ fractions
increasingly dominate at larger radii and higher M∗ .
Ex-situ stars at R∼2Re make up .20% of the projected
stellar mass of M∗ . 1010.5 M ETGs, rising up to &80%
for M∗ & 1011.5 M ETGs.
Stellar accretion and minor mergers provide an explanation for the size growth of spheroids from z ∼ 2 to
the present. Keeping in mind the simple nature of our
comparison, we showed that the logZ profiles of nearby
ETGs are consistent with this framework. However,
this picture might not apply to S0s, which we visually
estimate to compose . 20% of our sample. The growth
and accretion histories of S0s can differ from those of
elliptical galaxies (nSersic > 2.5; Blanton et al. 2003,
2005; Peng et al. 2010), as suggested by Johnston et al.
(2012, 2014); Fraser-McKelvie et al. (2018); Saha &
Cortesi (2018) (see also Diaz et al. 2018). Moreover,
galaxy assembly history is not only expected to depend
on the total M∗ or morphology of galaxies, but also on
their environment (e.g. Greene et al. 2015, 2019). We
will study second order trends in the metallicity profiles
of ETGs in follow-up work.
6. SUMMARY

We characterized the radial stellar metallicity profiles
of MaNGA ETGs and compared them with predictions
from hierarchical formation. Through stellar population
fitting with Firefly, pPXF, and Prospector, we found the
following:
1. The three codes are built around different stellar population synthesis codes and are unique in their
approach to fitting. Nonetheless, we found the main
conclusions from this paper not to be dependent on the
fitting code.
2. The profiles of logM∗ /M & 11 ETGs fall with
galactocentric radius and flatten beyond R∼1.5Re .
Based on hydrodynamical simulations, a possible

Figure 5. Observational estimate of the ex-situ stellar mass fraction in ETGs as a function of M∗ for three different radial
bins. Shown are the 1σ contours derived with Firefly (grey), pPXF (red), and Prospector (yellow). The estimates come from
expressing the metallicity profiles of ETGs as a linear combination of in-situ and ex-situ profiles (Figure 4). Note how ex-situ
signatures increase with M∗ .

explanation for this flattening is stellar accretion
through minor mergers.
3. The average radial metallicity profiles of ETGs are
not linear. Therefore, linear fits can miss important behavior in the stellar metallicity profiles. When possible,
fitting stellar population gradients should be avoided.
4. Using informed assumptions for the in-situ metallicity profile and the metallicity of accreted stars, we
built a toy model to infer the ex-situ stellar mass fraction
of ETGs. We found ex-situ signatures to grow in
significance toward large galactocentric radii and higher
M∗ .

APPENDIX
A. LICK INDEX PROFILES

Lick indices (Worthey et al. 1994; Thomas et al. 2003; Parikh et al. 2019) are a useful method to empirically estimate
the chemical abundance patterns of galaxies. Here, we compute the radial profiles of Mgb(5178), Fe5270, and Fe5335
to test the high M∗ flattening we find through stellar population fitting. We retrieved the indices measured by the
MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline and used them to compute:
p
[MgFe]’ = Mgb(0.72 × Fe5270 + 0.28 × Fe5335)
(A1)
<Fe> = 0.5 × Fe5270 + 0.5 × Fe5335

(A2)

Here [MgFe]’ and <Fe> are tracers of the global and Iron abundances (Johnston et al. 2018). We binned the
measurements into the five annuli R/Re = [0, 0.5], [0.5, 1], [1, 1.5], [1.5, 2], and [2, 2.5] to derive the median profiles
shown in Figure 5. Note how the profiles flatten for the highest M∗ bin.
