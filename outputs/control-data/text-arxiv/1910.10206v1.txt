Abstract. We give a K-theoretic account of the basic properties of Witt vectors. Along the
way we re-prove basic properties of the little-known Witt vector norm, give a characterization of
Witt vectors in terms of algebraic K-theory, and a presentation of the Witt vectors that is useful
for computation.

1. Introduction
The ring of Witt vectors is an object that rears its head frequently in algebra, number theory,
algebraic geometry, and homotopy theory. For all this, it seems to cause consternation because of
its opaque definition and the number of equally opaque identities that accompany it. Our aim is to
demystify the definition, explain its ubiquity and provide devices for working with the identities.
Let A be a ring. We take as a starting point Almkvist’s beautiful theorem that the group come 0 (End(A)),
pletion of the category of endomorphisms of finitely generated projective A-modules, K
is equivalent to the rational big Witt vectors, i.e. the Witt vectors that appear as fractions of
polynomials in (1 + A[[t]])× [1]. Almkvist’s theorem tells us that the Witt vectors are nothing mysterious: they are objects that capture the compatibilites between iterated traces of endomorphisms.
In the instances where this does not literally work, the Witt vectors can be viewed as formal dee 0 (End(A)),
vices that force this to work. Indeed, the (big) Witt vectors essentially want to be K
but the input category for K-theory has to be finite in some way. If we allowed ourselves infinite
dimensional endomorphisms, we would be able to capture all characteristc polynomials and thus
all, not just rational, Witt vectors. However, this is proscribed by the construction of K-theory: an
Eilenberg Swindle will not allow for infinite dimensional data. We repair this by a simple completion
procedure, inspired by [7].
e 0 (End(A)) such that completing K
e 0 (End(A)) with
Theorem 1.1. There is a filtration V • on K
respect to V • is W (A).

This statement has many applications. First, the Witt vectors do not have many pleasant
universal properties, but this characterization points the way: for example, it should be an initial
V -complete object in a suitable category.
Further, although Theorem 1.1 is a kind of universal statement, it still allows us to extract a
very concrete presentation of the Witt vectors, suitable for computation.
Theorem 1.2. (see Theorem 8.8) For a commutative ring A, the ring of big Witt vectors W (A),
is isomorphic to formal sums of symbols (a)i , a ∈ A, i ∈ N, with multiplication given by the formula
(a)i (b)j = gcd(i, j)(aj/ gcd(i,j) bi/ gcd(i,j) )lcm(i,j)
Theorem 1.1 also us us how to construct operations on the Witt vectors. Any functorial construction on End(A) that is continuous in the V -topology descends to an operation on Witt vectors.
This allows for a conceptual, categorical proof of the following theorem.

Theorem 1.3. [2] There is a a multiplicative norm on the (big) Witt vectors W (A) induced by a
norm functor N i on End(A) (see Section 4 for definitions).
This multiplicative norm is exactly the multiplicative analogue of the standard Verschiebung
map.
In order to introduce this circle of ideas, we start with the characteristic polynomial. Let V1 , V2
be vector spaces and T1 , T2 be endomorphisms, and define the characteristic polynomial to be
ch(Ti ) = det(id −tTi ) ∈ 1+A[t]. The category of vector spaces is endowed with the binary operation
“⊕”, and the characteristic polynomial behaves well with respect to this operation: ch(T1 ⊕ T2 ) =
ch(T1 ) ch(T2 ) in (1+A[t])× . The characteristic polynomial then descends to a group homomorphism
(1.4)

e 0 (End(A))
K

(1 + A[[t]])× .

The category of endomorphisms is endowed with another binary operation, the tensor product,
e 0 (End(A)) into a ring. But we have already used up the natural multiplication on
⊗. This turns K
×
(1 + A[[t]]) . How should we make (1.4) a ring map? The punchline is:
Witt multiplication is exactly the operation
that makes (1.4) a ring map.

This is due to Alkmvist [1]. Witt multiplication is a device forced on us by linear algebra, and
can similarly be extracted via linear algebra.
However, use of the characteristic polynomial is not necessarily the best way to prove relations
in the Witt vectors. As we recall below, the characteristic polynomial is a repackaging of iterated
traces. These turn out to produce the usual ghost maps. Furthermore, iterated traces exist in
contexts where characteristic polynomials do not (for example, in the category of spectra). A
useful slogan is the following:
All operations on Witt vectors are controlled by
the combinatorics of iterated traces
This is still somewhat inadequate for a few reasons. First, as we note below, the packaging in
terms of iterated traces has an issue when the underlying ring has torsion. Second, some Witt vectors
cannot be captured by endomorphisms of finitely generated projective modules. Both problems can
e 0 (End(A)):
be repaired simultaneously by considering the Witt vectors as a completion of K
e 0 (End(A))
The Witt vectors are a completion of K

This is the most satisfying explanation, encompassing all avatars of the Witt vectors, but as
universal constructions usually are, it is the least useful for computations. However, the perspective
taken leads to a presentation of Witt vectors which appears to be extremely useful for computation.
This also leads to the view that:
the Witt coordinates are a normal form
for completed virtual endomorphisms
in the same way that the rational canonical form is for matrices.
When one takes the viewpoint that endomorphisms are the central object to be working with,
the presence of the following structures also become more apparent.

• Truncation sets These arise from the combinatorics of iterated traces. If Tr(f i ) is nonzero, then frequently, so is Tr(f id ).
• Symmetric polynomials If one accepts traces of endomorphisms as the central object,
P n
then one way of studying them is via eigenvalues. Sums of iterated traces are then
λi ,
which can be profitably expressed in terms of symmetric polynomials.
• λ-rings The category of modules, and the category of modules of endomorphisms both
have λ-operations. The λ-operations are continuous in the V -topology and so descend to
operations on the Witt vectors.
• The ring (1 + A[[t]])× : This is the natural target of the characteristic polynomial.
Finally, if one is of a homotopy theoretic bent, the structure one witnesses as coming from
e 0 (End(A)) should be behaving similarly for higher algebraic K-theory. Some conjectures suggest
K
themselves, which we discuss more fully in Section 9.

e
Conjecture 1.5. There is a filtration V • on the algebraic K-theory spectrum K(End(A))
such that
the first associated graded component is THH(A). The completion with respect to the filtration is
TR(A).

We offer some reasonably compelling evidence for this conjecture, and return to it in work-inprogress.
Outline. In Section 2 we review the classical definitions of the big Witt vectors and p-typical Witt
vectors.
In the next section, we explain a motivating example: the big Witt vectors of Z can be constructed
as the K-theory of almost finite sets.
In Section 4 we review the linear algebraic view of the Witt vectors. This is mostly a synthesis of
[1, 11]. The only new observation is the existence of the multiplicative norm arises at the categorical
level. Section 5 is a quick discussion of the p-typical Witt vectors from a linear algebraic perspective.
Section 6 is devoted to using linear algebra to verify a number of identities in the Witt vectors.
These verifications are considerably less painful than the usual ones. Again, much of this material is
exposition of facts surely known to Almkvist and others. As a novel application, however, we quickly
recover identities involving Angeltveit’s Witt norm. We discuss how the Artin-Hasse exponential
can be viewed as a p-typical characteristic polynomial.
Section 7 moves to a K-theoretic view of the Witt vectors. We show that W (A) is a completion
of the algebraic K-theory of endomorphisms. Following that, in Section 8, we also give a new
presentation of the Witt vectors, as well as a fairly algorithmic process for translating between
ghost and Witt coordinates.
Finally, Section 9 contains some conjectures suggested by the analysis in this paper.
Acknowledgements. The description of the rational Witt vectors in this paper has been around
since Almkvist’s papers, and the author was alerted to it by Dan Grayson’s exposition [11]. The
author has explained this perspective to many experts on Witt vectors, and it does not seem to be
well known, hence this paper.
David Mehrle provided helpful feedback on a draft of this paper, and caught many typos in the
process. The author would like to thank Inna Zakharevich for encouraging him to write this paper,

2. A Review of the Witt Vectors
We begin with the big Witt vectors. The definitions below are terse (but not much more terse
than usual). For less idiosyncratic treatments of the Witt vectors, we recommend [13, 16].
Definition 2.1. The (big) Witt functor is an endofunctor W : Ring → Ring with the following
property. As a set,
∞
Y
A = {(a1 , a2 , . . . ) : ai ∈ A}
W (A) =
i=1

The ring structure is determined by the requirement that the ghost map
X n/d
dad
an 7→
d|n

determines a natural transformation W (−) →
coordinate-wise.
A related definition is the p-typical version.

Q

(−) where the ring structure on the latter is given

Definition 2.2. The p-typical Witt functor is the endofunctor Wp∞ : Ring → Ring with the
following property. As a set
∞
Y
A = {(a0 , a1 , a2 , . . . ) : ai ∈ A}.
Wp∞ (A) =
i=0

The ring structure is determined by the requirement that the “ghost map”
X
n−i
pi api
an 7→
i

determines a natural transformation of functors Wp∞ (−) →

Q

(−)

Remark 2.3. Note the minor difference in indexing conventions: we think of Wp∞ (A) as being
indexed on pi , hence starting with i = 0, which corresponds to 1, instead of i = 1, which would
correspond to p.
From our perspective, there are a few problems with this definition. The first is that it is entirely
opaque — exactly why these ghost maps should arise is obscure. The second is that to define
p-typical Witt vectors for p-torsion rings, one must invoke functoriality. The third is that it is not
obvious that it is well defined. It is verified by proving the following.
Theorem 2.4. There are two families of polynomials (the Witt universal polynomials)
s(x1 , x2 , . . . , y1 , y2 , . . . ), m(x1 , x2 , . . . , y1 , y2 , . . . ) ∈ Z[x1 , x2 , . . . , y1 , y2 , . . . ]
such that for a, b ∈ W (A)
a + b = (s1 (a, b), s2 (a, b), . . . )
a · b = (m1 (a, b), m2 (a, b), . . . )
An identical statement holds for Wp∞ (A). Furthermore, the polynomials si , mi depend only on
x1 , . . . , xi , y1 , . . . , yi .
The (big) Witt vectors come equipped with two useful operations. Each of them must either be
specified on the Witt coordinates, or else specified on the ghost coordinates, and shown to lift to
the Witt coordinates.

Definition 2.5. The ring of big Witt vectors W (A) is equipped with a family of additive maps
V i : W (A) → W (A) called the Verschiebung(s). They are specified on Witt coordinates by
V i (a1 , a2 , . . . ) = (0, . . . ,

a1 , . . . , a2 , . . . )
|{z}
|{z}

2ith spot

Definition 2.6. The ring of big Witt vectors W (A) is equipped with a family of multiplicative
maps F i : W (A) → W (A) called the Frobenius maps specified on ghost coordinates by
F i (a1 , a2 , . . . ) = (ai1 , ai2 , . . . )
There are similar definitions for the p-typical Witt vectors, but they involve a mild change in
indexing.
Definition 2.7. The ring of p-typical Witt vectors Wp∞ (A) is equipped with an additive map
V : Wp∞ (A) → Wp∞ (A) called the Verschiebung. It is specified in Witt coordinates by
V (a0 , a1 , . . . , ) = (0, a0 , a1 , . . . )
Definition 2.8. The ring of p-typical Witt vectors Wp∞ (A) is equipped with a multiplicative map
F : W (A) → W (A) given on ghost coordinates by
F p (a0 , a1 , . . . ) = (ap0 , ap1 , . . . )
The standard way to check relations on the (big) Witt vectors is then to check on either the
Witt or ghost coordinates.
For later use, we note the following. The big Witt vectors are often encoded as the power series
ring (1 + A[[t]])× with the identification
∞
Y
(1 − ai ti )
(a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . ) 7→
i=1

As can be seen essentially from long division, every element in (1+A[[t]])× can be written in the form
of an element on the right. The group addition on (1+A[[t]])× is given by power series multiplication.
The multiplication, ∗, on (1+A[[t]])× is defined by the requirement that (1−at)∗(1−bt) = (1−abt).
Again, it must be shown that such a multiplication exists.
There are topologies on W (A) and Wp∞ (A) which will be important in the sequel. First, a
definition.
Definition
2.9. Wn (A) will denote the truncated big Witt vectors. As a set, it is isomorphic
Q
to ni=1 A. It is given a ring structure by using the first n universal Witt polynomials.
Similarly,
Wpn (A) denotes the truncated p-typical Witt vectors. As a set, it is isomorphic
Qn
to i=1 A. It is given a ring structure by the first n universal p-typical Witt vectors.

The (big) Witt vectors are equipped with restriction maps R : Wn+1 (A) → Wn (A) and R :
Wpn+1 (A) → Wpn (A) given by truncating the last element. It is then standard that

W (A) = lim Wn (A)
Wp∞ (A) = lim Wpn (A).
←−
←−
This presentation of W (A) and Wp∞ (A) imbues them with topologies, which are typically called
the V -topology. In the case of Wp∞ (A), this is because Wpn (A) = Wp∞ (A)/V n Wp∞ (A) and
Wp∞ (A) ⊃ V 1 Wp∞ (A) ⊃ V 2 Wp∞ (A) ⊃ · · ·
is a decreasing filtration on W (A). Similarly, if we let
V ≥i W (A) = {(0, . . . , 0, ai , ai+1 , . . . ) ∈ W (A)}

FACETS OF THE WITT VECTORS

this gives a decreasing filtration on W (A)
W (A) = V ≥1 W (A) ⊃ V ≥2 W (A) ⊃ · · ·
such that Wn (A) = W (A)/V ≥n+1 W (A).
Remark 2.10. We chose the notation V i and V ≥i to emphasize the difference in the role that
Verschiebung is playing. In the case of the p-typical Witt vectors, one really is filtering by iterated
Verschiebungs, since there is only one V map. This is not the case for the big Witt vectors.
In the case of the big Witt vectors, the topology is also reflected on power series.

Definition 2.11. Let (1 + A[[t]])×

≥n denote the power series of the form 1 + an t + an+1 t

The following proposition captures everything we need about about the topology on power series.

Proposition 2.12. (1+A[[t]])×

specified by V W (A) and (1 + A[[t]])≥n coincide, and

Wn (A)

is a ring homomorphism.
This finishes our exposition of the Witt vectors from a standard viewpoint.
3. Almost Finite Sets
As a prelude to the discussion linking K-theory and W (A), this short section is a case study
in the relationship between K-theory and the big Witt vectors of Z. It has long been known that
there are simple, K-theoretic, ways to present W (Z). Such presentations come come up in [6, 8]. In
b C (Z). In the case of [6], the author considers
[8] the authors consider a completed Burnside ring Ω
a monoid he calls PER, which consists of infinite permutations, but of what he calls “finite type”
and then group completes to K0 (PER). In either case, the authors show they have a K-theoretic
model for W (Z).
These approaches are equivalent, and we use definitions from [8].
Definition 3.1. Let the category of almost finite sets, Setaf be the category of pairs (X, σ)
where X is a countable set and σ : X → X is a permutation such that the fixed point set of σ n is
finite for each n. Morphisms f : (X, σX ) → (Y, σY ) are bijections of sets f : X → Y that commute
with the given permutations. The Grothendieck group of almost finite sets is K0 (Setaf ).
Remark 3.2. The K0 (Setaf ) is generated by formal sums of cycles with Z-coefficients. That is, every
element [σ] ∈ K0 (Setaf ) can be written as a formal sum, with each ci finite,
[σ] =

∞
X
i=1

where Ci denotes an i-cycle.
The key insight of [8] is then the following.

is a ring isomorphism.

One of the virtues of this theorem is that if one were to take K0 (Setaf ) as the definition of the
big Witt vectors of Z, multiplication and addition would become fantastically simple. Elements are
formal sums of cycles Ci , and from the combinatorics of cycles we have the following formulas (see
[8, Eqn (2.5.4)])
Ci · Cj ∼
= gcd(i, j)Clcm(i,j)
The Frobenius and Verschiebung operators can be given categorically. The Frobenius, F i , (called
“restriction” in [8]) is given by applying each cycle i times. The Verschiebung maps (called “induction” in [8]) are slightly more complicated, but still defined at the level of the category of finite
sets.
It is also worth discussing the topology on K0 (Setaf ). To the author’s knowledge, Dress and
Siebeneicher do not discuss this in [8], but it is useful for intuition.
Definition 3.4. Let V ≥k Setfin consist of finite sets and permutations whose cycle types are of size
greater than k.
The group K0 (V ≥k Setfin ) is generated by finite formal sums of cycles Cj with j ≥ k.
Definition 3.5. Let V ≥k Setaf consist of almost finite sets and permutations whose cycle types are
of size greater than k.
The group K0 (V ≥k Setaf ) is generated
by almost finite formal sums of cycles Cj with j ≥ k.
P∞
That is, expessions of the form i=k ni Ci where ni is finite. From the multiplicative structure
given above, this is an ideal of the ring K0 (Setaf ).
Definition 3.6. The V -topology on K0 (Setaf ) is given by the decreasing filtration by ideals
K0 (Setaf ) ⊃ K0 (V ≥1 Setaf ) ⊃ K0 (V ≥2 Setaf ) ⊃ · · ·
There is a similar V -topology on K0 (Setfin ). We also define
K0 (Setaf )/V n := K0 (Setaf )/K0 (V ≥n Setaf )
and similar for K0 (Setfin )/V n .
A consequence of these definitions is the following lemma.
Lemma 3.7. The maps
K0 (Setfin )/V n

K(Setaf )/V n

and
K0 (Setaf )
are ring isomorphisms.
And we obtain the following theorem.

lim K (Setaf )/V n

Theorem 3.8. Let (1 + Z[[t]])× have the Witt ring structure, then
lim K0 (Setfin )/V n
←−

(1 + Z[[t]])×

is an isomorphism of rings.
Proof. We know that K0 (Setaf ) ∼

Take the limit of both sides — the only thing to worry about is lim terms, but all the maps in the

tower are surjective, so this vanishes.

This theorem is not so useful for computation, but it does have useful conceptual content: the
Witt vectors arise from K-theory once we pass from a finite to infinite context in the most natural
way possible.
4. The Main Diagram
We now come to the core of the paper. The viewpoint of this paper is that the ring of Witt
vectors is best considered in terms of algebraic K-theory. To this end, we recall the definition of
the K-theory of endomorphisms, and the key fact Theorem 4.3, due to Almkvist, which provides
the impetus for this work. Roughly, it is the statement that the K-theory of the category of
endomorphisms of finitely generated projective modules over a ring is isomorphic as a ring to the
rational power series ring (here “rational” means fractions of polynomials, not defined over Q).
We then show that all the structure that one sees on Witt vectors can be recovered from this
identification: Frobenius, Verschiebung, Norm, ghost maps, the λ-ring structure etc. Furthermore,
they all have categorical definitions. That is, they all come from functorial operations at the level
of the category of endomorphisms.
Definition 4.1. Let A be a commutative ring. Let End(A) denote the category of endomorphism
of finitely generated projective A-modules. It has
• objects: Endomorphisms of finitely generated projective A-modules, T : P → P
• morphisms: Given two endomorphisms (P1 , T1 ) and (P2 , T2 ), a morphism (P1 , T1 ) →
(P2 , T2 ) is a map f : P1 → P2 making the following diagram commute
P1

f

T1

P1

P2
T2

f

P2

The category End(A) is also an exact category: it has exact sequences given by sequences of
endomorphisms that are exact upon forgetting to the category of modules. One can thus define a
group completion K0 (End(A)) that has generators given by exact sequence 0 → T1 → T3 → T2 → 0
and relations [T3 ] = [T2 ]+[T1 ]. There is a split surjection K0 (End(A)) → K0 (A) given by forgetting
the endomorphism, and the splitting is given by the zero endomorphism.
Definition 4.2. The K-theory of endomorphisms is the kernel of the split surjection
K0 (End(A)) → K0 (A)
e 0 (End(A)).
We denote it K

(P, T ) 7→ P

We now state the theorem that is the backbone of this paper.

Theorem 4.3. [1][10, Cor. 3]. The characteristic polynomial
e 0 (End(A)) → (1 + A[[t]])×
ch : K

is injective, and its image is the rational power series.

The proofs in [1] and [10] of Theorem 4.3 are no more than a few pages long, and both are
very clever. If one is only concerned with fields this is more or less a statement about the rational
canonical form.
With this result in hand, we spend the rest of this section explaining the following diagram,
which relates many standard constructions on Witt vectors:

Remark 4.10. Although it will not play much of a role in this paper, it is worth noting that the
category End(A) is equipped with exterior power operations (P, f ) 7→ (Λj P, λj f ). These give
e 0 (End(A)) the structure of a λ-ring.
K

As we will see later, these category-level Frobenius, Verschiebung and Norm govern the behavior
of the usual Frobenius, Verschiebung and Norm. The λ-operations give the λ-ring structure on the
Witt vectors.
We now define the maps in the diagram. We begin with the central map.
Definition 4.11. The map

Tr• : K

It is simply a map of the traces of iterates of f .

Remark 4.12. Unlike
Q many of the maps in the diagram, it is very easy to see that Tr is a ring
map, if we define A to have pointwise addition and multiplication: the trace is both additive in
direct sum and multiplicative in tensor product. This is one of the great virtues of giving this map
a central role.

The map Wn (A) → End(A) is a composite of two maps. There is an obvious embedding A ֒→
End(A) given by sending a to the endomorphism given by multiplication by a:
a : A → A = V 1 (a) ∈ End(A)

Remark 4.15. This may seem a bit ad hoc, but it is exactly this linear algebraic maneuver that
yields all of the identities about Witt vectors. We will resolve some of the ad hoc nature below.
Example 4.16. Considering the composite gh := Tr• ◦τ resolves some of the mystery around the

This gives a clear way of remembering the familiar definition of the ghost coordinates, which
usually seem to come from nowhere
X n/d
dad .
ghn =
d|n

Example 4.17. From such a table one sees that the ghost map is not necessarily surjective, and how
to reconstruct a Witt vector from its coordinates. It even offers a way of doing it that is not much
more difficult than long division, it is essentially “V -division”
Suppose we want to multiply V 2 (a) = (0, a) and V 2 (b) = (0, b) in Witt coordinates. In ghost
coordinates, we see that their product is
0

4ab

4a2 b2

0

4a3 b3

0

0

4a4 b4 .

We want to find an element in W (A) whose ghost coordinates are exactly this sequence. We begin
the “long division” by finding c such that Tr2 (V 2 (c)) = 4ab. But Tr2 (V 2 (c)) = 2c, so c = 2ab. Now
we compute iterated traces of V 2 (2ab) and subtract

−28a4 b4

Continuing, we need c such that Tr4 (V 4 (c)) = 4c = −4a2 b2 , so c = −a2 b2 . And so on. If one
continues in this way, one produces the necessary universal polynomials. This example is also
worked out in [11] using the characteristic polynomial.
Dwork’s Lemma, which we state below, is also a consequence of these combinatorics. It is a
formal statement of which elements the procedure above will work on (i.e. when we can evenly
divide coefficients as we did above).
Proposition 4.18. A sequence (w1 , w2 , . . . ) is in the image of the ghost map if
wpn a ≡ wppn−1 a mod pn
for each prime p and gcd(p, m) = 1.
We continue with the rest of the maps in (4.4).
The top map is, of course, the characteristic polynomial. The ring structure on (1 + A[[t]])× is
assumed to have the structure that makes the characteristic polynomial a ring map, i.e. the Witt
structure.
e 0 (End(A)) → (1 + A[[t]])× is given by a particular normalization
Definition 4.19. The map ch : K
of the characteristic polynomial
ch(P, f ) = det(id −tf )
Remark 4.20. There are 8 normalization of the characteristic polynomial:
det(id ±tf )± , det(t id ±f )±
These differences lurk in the background and make for confusing disparities between different treatments of Witt vectors.
e 0 (End(A)): one defined by iterated traces, the other
We have now defined two maps out of K
defined by the characteristic polynomial. The bottom horizontal map and the right vertical map
relate them. The bottom map in (4.4) is simple to define.

Summarizing, we have seen that the ghost maps come from considering traces of particular
matrices. The structure of Witt multiplication are forced on us by a desire to have the characteristic
polynomial be a ring map.
5. The p-typical Witt vectors
The case of p-typical Witt vectors is no more difficult, and illuminated by thinking about the
Witt vectors as recording traces. The p-typical Witt vectors are obtained by formally declaring
that we only care about p-power traces of some endomorphism. To this end, we only use the
2
3
2
3
Verschiebung operations {V p , V p , V p , . . . } and Frobenius {F p , F p , F p , . . . }. We note that in
the literature on p-typical Witt vectors these maps are referred to by their p-exponent, so Vpi is
usually written Vi .

As is the case with the big Witt vectors, the ghost maps can be computed via traces. The
difference is that we only care about traces whose order is a power of the prime.

and summing down columns, we get the ghost maps which are
n
X
pi ap−i .
ghn (a0 , a1 , . . . ) =
i=0

We can recover the universal polynomials again, by a relatively painless V -division algorithm.

Example 5.4. We compute the product of (a0 , a1 ) and (b0 , b1 ) to compute the first few universal
polynomials. First, compute the ghost coordinates using the methods above, and then begin the
V -division:
V 1 (a0 b0 )

a0 b 0

(ap0 + pa1 )(bp0 + pb1 )

−a0 b0
0

−ap0 bp0
pap0 b1 + pap1 b0 + p2 a1 b1

So we need a c such that Trp (V p (c)) = pc = pap0 b1 + pap1 b0 + p2 a1 b1 . Indeed, this is the universal
Witt polynomial
ap0 b1 + ap1 b0 + pa1 b1
Here we get to a deficiency of this approach (and of all approaches based on ghost maps): the
expressions involving traces do not make sense when there is p-torsion. This is in some sense
the point of Witt vectors: they mimic the combinatorics of traces, without necessarily mentioning
traces.
Example 5.5. In the p-typical case something interesting happens for the characteristic polynomial.
As far as the author knows, there is no “characteristic polynomial” defined linear algebraically
which only extracts the data of p-power traces. Instead, working around (4.4), we see that the
“characteristic polynomial” of V 1 (a) in this case is the Artin-Hasse exponential
!

To the author, at least, this explains the appearance of such a bizarre expression. If we do this

with the other Verschiebungs, we get E(V p (ai )) is the same as E(ai ) after performing the ring

automorphism t 7→ tp . But this is the ith Verschiebung in the p-typical situation! Thus, from
consideration of traces, we get a composite

To reiterate, this was all obtained by just declaring, somewhat formally, that we only care about
the traces of order pi .
6. Identities, Old and New
In this section we present some of the standard identities on the big Witt vectors, and p-typical
Witt vectors. An interesting consequence of the view we take is that the identities are often verified
on a categorical level, and one can always tell whether the operation is additive, multiplicative,
etc. The typical procedure is to verify identities by showing that they agree on either all iterated
traces, or on the characteristic polynomial; whichever is easier. For this section, we will verify
identities using traces. This requires us to assume a torsion-free (or p-torsion free) ring throughout
this section. However, the usual Witt vector tricks work to port the identities: we invoke the
e 0 (End(A)) and the density of the rational Witt vectors in the Witt vectors to
functoriality of K
extend the results.

6.1. Old Identities. As warm-up exercise in the use of the K-theory of endomorphisms, we prove
some standard relationships between Frobenius and Verschiebung. None of these proofs are necessarily easier than the usual proofs that involve computing in ghost coordinates, but they are a bit
more transparent. For discussion of the norm, the style of proof used below is easier.

f ⊗ V n (g) = V n (F n (f ) ⊗ g)

Proof. We want to show
Tri (f ⊗ V n (g)) = Tri (V n (F n (f ) ⊗ g))
for all i. We use formulas that we now have at our disposal, together with the multiplicativity of
trace. By multiplicativity and Lemma 6.2
(
n Tr(f i ) Tr(g i/n ) n|i
Tri (f ⊗ V n (g)) = Tr(f i ) Tri (V n (g)) =

otherwise
Similarly,

6.2. Relations on the Norm. In [2] Angeltveit produces a multiplicative norm on Witt vectors.
The construction proceeds in the usual way by requiring that certain identities hold on ghost
coordinates and checking that they induce a multiplication in Witt coordinates. For the moment,
e 0 (End(A)) and we examine what identities hold.
we take our definition of “Witt vectors” to be K
e 0 (End(A)) is defined via the multiplicative Verschiebung (DefiniDefinition 6.5. The norm on K
tion 4.8). It is a multiplicative monoid homomorphism
N i : K0 (End(A))⊗ → K0 (End(A))⊗

that is, it does not respect the additive structure.
Given this definition, the main theorem of [2] admits a linear algebraic proof.
Proposition 6.6. [2, Thm. 1.2] Let a ∈ W (A). Then F i ◦ N i (a) = ai
Proof. It is enough to prove for iterated traces of endomorphisms. First
N i (f ) = rot(id ⊗ id ⊗ · · · ⊗ f )
That is, we take a d-fold tensor, apply f to the last coordinate and rotate. Thus
F i (N i (f )) = N i (f ) ◦ · · · ◦ N i (f ) = f ⊗ · · · ⊗ f

By the multiplicativity of trace, we have Tr(F N (f )) = f and we are done.



As in the case of the additive Verschiebung and Frobenius, and the Norm and Frobenius interact
more subtley depending on divisibility properties. Again, these divisibility properties come from
the behavior of cyclic groups.
Example 6.7. Let V be an n-dimensional vector space, with basis e1 , . . . , en . Then V ⊗k has basis
ei1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ eik . The norm map applies an endomorphism to the last coordinate and then rotates the
basis elements. The fixed-points, and thus the trace, of this rotation action are clearly governed
by divisibility properties. For example, rot3 fixes e1 ⊗ e2 ⊗ e3 ⊗ e1 ⊗ e2 ⊗ e3 . The basis elements
e⊗k
are always fixed. Similarly, when computing traces, we only care about fixed points of basis
i
element. Let f be an endomorphism given by a matrix (aij ). We examine what happens to a basis
element under the norm
ei1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ eik 7→ ei1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ f (eik )
X
ei1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ aik j ej
=
j

7→

X

aik j (ej ⊗ ei1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ eik−1 )

j

Thus, the terms where j = i1 , i1 = i2 , i2 = i3 , ..., contribute to the trace. Similar statements hold
upon iteration.
Given the above example, the following theorem is now easy.
Theorem 6.8. Let p be a prime. Then
Tri (N ⊗p f ) =

(

(Tr(f i/p ))p
Tr(f )i

FACETS OF THE WITT VECTORS

Thus, for d a positive integer
Tri (N ⊗d f ) = Tr(f i/ gcd(d,i) )gcd(d,i)
Proof. We simply codify the previous example.



Combining the previous theorem, with fact that ghost coordinates are computed via traces, we
obtain the following theorem of Angeltveit.
Lemma 6.9. [2, Thm. 1.4] On ghost coordinates, the norm maps (xt ) 7→ (yt ) are given by
yt = xgt/g

g = gcd(d, t)

7. The V -Filtration
In this section, we attempt to clarify more of the structure of the Witt vectors. From our
perspective, there are a few issues with the Witt vectors as they stand. One is the kludgy feel of
consistently reasoning with torsion-free rings and then porting answers to rings with torsion based
on universal polynomials. Another is a lack of a clean answer for what the Witt vectors are. A
third is their completely uncomputable nature, despite their importance and concreteness. This is
by no means an exhaustive list. In this section we show that the Witt vectors are a completion of
e 0 (End(A)), which, in some sense, answers what the Witt vectors are. This definition will
the ring K
allow us to repair the rest of the issues.
Before continuing, it is useful to have some discussion of the structure of the ring of rational
power series (1 + A[[t]])×
rat . We certainly have occasion to consider the rational power series, and
also various truncations.
Notation 7.1. Let (1 + A[[t]])×
rat denote the rational power series, i.e. ones of the form
1 + a 1 t + a 2 t2 + a 3 t3 + · · · + a m tm
1 + b 1 t + b 2 t2 + b 3 t3 + · · · + b n tn
n
Let (1 + A[[t]])×
rat,≥n denote the rational power series denote those of the form 1 + an t + · · · .

e 0 (End(A)) induces an isomorphism
By Almkvist’s theorem, the characteristic polynomial map K
of rings
=
e 0 (End(A)) ∼
K
(1 + A[[t]])×

It is useful to know the inverse map. Suppose we have a rational power series written as in
e 0 (End(A)) mapping to it is the virtual endomorphism

Proof. Both rings are power series (1 + a1 t + · · · + an tn ), with Witt multiplication and addition,
modulo higher order terms.

The intuition behind the procedures in this section is that the characteristic polynomial and
iterated traces encode the same data, and so one knows nearly complete information about an
endomorphism from iterated traces. When taking iterated traces, passing from Tri (f ) to Tri+1 (f )
moves new ring elements into the diagonal. The first n Witt coordinate contain information,
encoded in the most parsimonious fashion, about what new ring elements move in. Thus, we create
a filtration based on traces. This also amounts to the same thing as creating a filtration based on
Verschiebungs: as we have already seen, these control the “depth” of traces.
e 0 (End(A)) is defined as follows. The kth filtration level
Definition 7.3. The V -filtration V ≥k K
≥k e
V K0 (End(A)) is the inverse image of (1 + A[[t]])×
≥k under the characteristic polynomial map.
This suggests the following, more categorical, definition.

Definition 7.4. The V -filtration V ≥k on End(A) is defined as follows. Let V ≥k End(A) be the
full subcategory of End(A) consisting of those endomorphisms in the inverse image of (1 + A[t])×
≥n ,
the polynomials of degree higher than n.
Remark 7.5. We are trying to avoid introducing heavy language into this paper, but a better way
to define this category is as the thick subcategory generated by the images of all V j with j ≥ k.
We have the following fact.
Lemma 7.6. The category V ≥k End(A) is an exact category.
Proof. It is a full subcategory of an exact category, and it is closed under extension.



Thus, we can take K-theory V ≥k End(A). It is useful for peace of mind to check the following.
Proposition 7.7. The inclusion map induces an isomorphism of rings
e 0 (End(A)) ∼
e 0 (V ≥k End(A))
V ≥k K

Proof. There is a clear inclusion map

e 0 (V ≥k End(A))

e 0 (End(A)) can be written as a

fraction of polynomials p(x)/q(x). Each of p(x), q(x) must be in V ≥k K
p(x), q(x) to endomorphisms Tp and Tq . By definition these endomorphisms are in V ≥k End(A).
e 0 (End(A)) to a virtual endomorphism Tp − Tq and we are
Thus, we have lifted an element in V ≥k K
done.

The V -filtration is a decreasing filtration:

End(A) ⊃ V ≥1 End(A) ⊃ V ≥2 End(A) ⊃ · · ·
and it descends to a filtration on K0 :
e 0 (End(A)) ⊃ V ≥1 K
e 0 (End(A)) ⊃ V ≥2 K
e 0 (End(A)) ⊃
K

Furthermore, the filtration behaves well with respect to the two binary operations.

Second, the generalized Teichmüller map descends to an isomorphism of rings. Recall that this is

In general, we thus suggest the following definition for Witt vectors.
Definition 7.12. Let A be a ring (which may or may not be commutative). Then
e (End(A))/V j
W (A) := lim K
←− 0
j

Remark 7.13. We have shown that for a commutative rings W (A) ∼
= W (A). In future work, we hope
to show that the definition also coincides for non-commutative rings. It should be true, and should
go through the identification of topological restriction homology, TR and Hesselholt’s identification
of the non-commutative Witt vectors of A with TR(A) [14, Thm. 2.2.9].
There are a few advantages to this definition. One is it allows us to define operations on Witt
vectors in a categorical way.
Proposition 7.14. Let G be an endofunctor G : End(A) → End(A) such that the induced map
e 0 (End(A)) → K
e 0 (End(A)) is continuous in the V -topology. Then G descends to W (A).
G:K

Corollary 7.15. There is a (multiplicative) norm map on W (A) given by the multiplicative Verschiebung.
Another advantage is that the Witt vectors only depend on the underlying category of finitely
generated projective modules. Then, accepting this as the definition, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 7.16. The Witt vectors are Morita invariant: if A, B are Morita equivalent rings, then
W (A) ∼
= W (B).
As stated, this is not so useful. The canonical example of Morita equivalent rings are A and the
matrix ring Mn (A), and the latter is noncommutative. We have not checked that this definition of
Witt vectors agrees with the definition of non-commutative Witt vectors. However, as mentioned,
this should hold.
The Witt vectors do not have any pleasant universal property as far as we know — and this is
perhaps one illustration why: they are a limit built out of colimits built out of a group completion.
In order to state a nice universal property, the best way is then to pass to some category already
e 0 (End(A)). For example, one would want to have both a
equipped with the structure we see on K
Frobenius and a Verschiebung which should satisfy certain identities. This perhaps motivates the
appearance of pro-V -complexes or Cartier modules in much work that has to do with K-theory
(see, e.g. [3]).

8. A Presentation
∼ W (A). The idea is that instead of workIn this section we give a presentation of W (A) =
ing with algebraic shadows of endomorphisms, we should work with the endomorphisms directly.
Computations in this presentation are very tractable. Addition is an obvious operation, and multiplication is given by an extremely simple formula. No universal polynomials are required, and no
torsion assumptions are required — we are working with formal sums, and so the multiplication
by elements in Z never interferes with the ring elements. This is in some sense the source of all
the headaches with torsion in the standard treatments of Witt vectors: upon taking traces, these
formal coefficients begin interacting with the ring elements.
One of the reasons that Witt arithmetic is so complicated is that it involves two steps: one is
the actual arithmetic, and other is converting the answer into a Teichmüller representative (see
Definition 8.13), or a kind of normal form. By separating out the two steps, each becomes much
easier.
To begin, each element of W (A) can be represented by a formal sum of Verschiebungs
c11 V 1 (a11 ) ⊕ c12 V 1 (a12 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ c1n1 V 1 (a1n1 )⊕
c21 V 2 (a21 ) ⊕ c22 V 2 (a22 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ c2n2 V 2 (a2n2 )⊕
c31 V 3 (a31 ) ⊕ c32 V 3 (a32 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ c3n3 V 3 (a3n3 )⊕
..
.
as can be seen via the characteristic isomorphism ch : W (A) → (1 + A[[t]])× .
Remark 8.1. We think of these Verschiebungs as the atomic bits of endomorphisms. Adding V n (an )
adds some extra iterated traces to the ghost map, or an extra term to the characteristic polynomial,
past degree n.
Of course, we have the usual Verschiebung and Frobenius operators. We also define a trace
operator.
Definition 8.2. The Verschiebung map is given by the formula
X
 X
Vk
ci V i (ai ) =
ci V ik (ai )

Definition 8.3. The Frobenius map is given by the formula
X
 X
k/ gcd(k,i)
)
Fk
ci V i (ai ) =
ci gcd(k, i)V i/ gcd(k,i) (ai

That is, the action of Frobenius is given by Lemma 6.3. This relation can also be proved using
the characteristic polynomial.
Definition 8.4. The trace, Tr : W (A) → A is given by
X

Tr
ci V i (ai ) = c1 a1

Note that the trace is a ring homomorphism. It is also important to observe that c1 a1 is an actual
ring element, rather than a formal endomorphism.
Remark 8.5. Though it is only an analogy or curiosity, it is worth mentioning that the trace is
really a residue — it extracts a single well-defined coordinate in a formal series. If one consider the

FACETS OF THE WITT VECTORS

23

characteristic polynomial with the inverse normalization det(id −tf )−1 , then trace is a residue in
the sense of complex analysis.
To avoid use of the ghost map, we redevelop the necessary relations using only the characteristic
polynomial.
Proposition 8.6. With definitions as above, the following identities hold
• V 1 (a)V i (b) = V i (F i (V 1 (a))V 1 (b)) for a, b ring elements in A
• F i V j (a) = gcd(i, j)V i/ gcd(i,j) F j/gcd(i,j) (a)
Remark 8.7. The appearance of the V 1 terms may seem odd, but we want to distinguish between
elements of W (A) (i.e. an element in the ring of completed endomorphisms) and a ring element
a ∈ A. These two objects behave quite differently. For instance, for n ∈ Z, the morphisms nV 1 (a)
and V 1 (na) are


a


..
V 1 (na) = (na).
nV 1 (a) = 

.
a
The elision of these two objects is somewhat dangerous.

Proof of Proposition. We check each identity on characteristic polynomials.
V 1 (a)V i (b) and V i (F i (V 1 (a))V 1 (b)) are

Using the usual “cyclic trick” for computing determinants, these obviously have the same determinant.
For the second identity it is enough to show that for primes F p V p = pV 1 and F p V q = V q F p for
distinct primes, p, q.
The identity F p V p = pV 1 is true at the level of endomorphisms.
To see F p V q = V q F p for distinct primes, we simply write the determinants that would verify

Finally, we get the following, without recourse to ghost maps.
Theorem 8.8. As an abelian group W (A) is formal sums of V i (ai ) with Z-coefficients. It acquires
a ring structure when multiplication is given by
j/ gcd(i,j) i/ gcd(i,j)
)
aj

V i (ai )V j (aj ) = gcd(i, j)V lcm(i,j) (ai

Proof. As a group, W (A) has this presentation. One must only check that the relations on multiplication hold. However, this is a consequence of Proposition 8.6 We compute
V i (ai )V j (aj ) = V j (F j (V i (ai ))V 1 (aj ))
= V j (gcd(i, j)V i/ gcd(i,j) F j/ gcd(i,j) V 1 (ai ))V 1 (aj ))
j/(i,j)

= gcd(i, j)V j ((V i/ gcd(i,j) ai

)V 1 (aj ))

j/(i,j)

= gcd(i, j)V j (V i/ gcd(i,j) (V 1 (ai

)F i/ gcd(i,j) V 1 (aj )))

j/ gcd(i,j) i/ gcd(i,j)
)
aj

= gcd(i, j)V j (V i/ gcd(i,j) (ai

j/ gcd(i,j) i/ gcd(i,j)
)
aj

= gcd(i, j)V lcm(i,j) (ai


Example 8.9. We return to the example of (0, a) ∗ (0, b), which is V2 (a)V2 (b). By the presentation,
we get 2V2 (ab). Indeed, one can then check that under the characteristic polynomial map, this
goes to 1 − 2abt2 + a2 b2 t4 , as Grayson gets in [11]. This is even easier than multiplication using
endomorphisms and the characteristic polynomial.
Some remarks are in order.
Remark 8.10. Identities in this form are well known. However, the derivation of the corresponding
identity relies on the same kind of unmotivated trick of desiring a functorial multiplication ∗ on
(1 + A[[t]])× such that (1 − at) ∗ (1 − bt) = (1 − abt) and then showing that such a multiplication
exists. In the above, a multiplication does exist on W (A) because End(A) has a tensor monoidal
structure. Working out the multiplication only depended on knowing that the characteristic polynomial is injective, so can detect equivalences in W (A). Thus, the multiplicative structure is a clear
consequence rather than a requirement.
Remark 8.11. This presentation appears to be quite similar to the approach of Cuntz–Deninger
[5]. They essentially work formally in the ghost coordinates (i.e. work on traces). It seems in
their approach that the group ring Z[A] is used to keep track of the difference between nV 1 (a) and
V 1 (na).
Remark 8.12. We began this paper arguing that Witt vectors are trying to encode of the combinatorics of traces. Interpreting V i (ai ) as an atomic element of trace, this is exactly what this
presentation of W (A) is doing.
P The ipresentation above is quite satisfying, but one may still want to express a formal
P i sum
cij V (aij ) with cij ∈ Z as a sum in the image of the Teichmüller map, i.e. of the form
V (ai ).
Since this is a useful concept, we make the following definition.
Definition 8.13. Let
L a ∈ W (A). A Teichmüller representative for a is an element a ∈ W (A)
written in the form i=1 V i (ai ) such that a = a.

FACETS OF THE WITT VECTORS

25

Remark 8.14. We sometimes say a is in Teichmüller form to emphasize the formal similarity
with putting a matrix in a canonical form: it amounts to choosing a particular basis to represent
endomorphisms.
The following example is useful for intuition:
Example 8.15. For this example assume that the ring we are working in is torsion-free. One could
imagine trying to build an endomorphism up from what kth traces are. This is exactly what the
Witt coordinates do. Suppose, for example, that Trk (f ) = ak and Tri (f ) = 0 for i ≤ k. Then
1 k
V (ak ) ∈ V ≥k+1 .
k
This is really the V -division procedure. One could repeat this:
f−

f − V (Tr(f )) ∈ V ≥2

1 2
f − V2
Tr (f − V (Tr(f ))) ∈ V ≥3




1 3
1
f − V3
Tr f − V2 (f − V (Tr(f )))
∈ V ≥4
3
2
..
.


The Witt coordinates are then what is subtracted off at each stage.
If the above example seems familiar, it is because it is formally the same as writing down the
Newton polynomials. That is, the Witt coordinates and the ghost coordinates have the same
relationships to each other as the symmetric polynomials and power polynomials. Indeed,
P kif we
imagine the the endomorphism has having eigenvalues λi , then the iterated traces are
λi and
the Witt coordinates should be the elementary symmetric polynomials in this coordinates (up to a
sign).
If we choose the normalization of the elementary symmetric polynomials where
X
σ0 = 1
σk = (−1)k
xi1 · · · xik

then, we have the identities

−kσkn = (−1)k−1 σk−1 p1 + (−1)k−2 σk−2 p2 + · · · + (−1)1 σ1 pk−1 − pk
which allow for recursive computation of the σk in terms of pk .
We have up until this point avoided ghost coordinates, but given that we want to translate into
Witt coordinates, we can no longer avoid them. However, with the correct definitions, we avoid
issues with torsion.
Definition 8.16. The modified trace map, Tr : W (A) → V ≥1 W (A)/V ≥2 W (A) is given by
c11 V 1 (a11 ) + c12 V 1 (a12 ) + · · · + c1n V 1 (a1n ) + higher order terms
{z
}

∈V ≥2 W (A)

c11 V 1 (a11 ) + c12 V 1 (a12 ) + · · · + c1n V 1 (a1n )

FACETS OF THE WITT VECTORS

26

This is again some kind of residue. We are not going all the way down to the ring A, but instead
considering the trace as recording some core, well-defined, term in a power series.
By the properties we have proved for the multiplicative structure, we immediately have the
following
Lemma 8.17. The modified trace is a ring homomorphism
The following lemma is also useful.
Lemma 8.18. In V ≥1 W (A)/V ≥2 W (A), V 1 (a + b) = V 1 (a) + V 1 (b). Consequently, V 1 (na) =
nV 1 (a) for n ∈ Z.
Proof. This is an easy check with characteristic polynomials.



For ease, we abbreviate the target of the modified ghost map to V ≥1 /V ≥2 , with the ring understood. Since we now have a trace, and we already had a Frobenius map, we can define a version of
the ghost map.
Definition 8.19. Define the modified ghost map on
x 7→ (Tr ◦ F n )(x)

W (A) →

Y

V ≥1 /V ≥2

Q ≥1 ≥2
The term
V /V
is given a ring structure with pointwise multiplication, and is called the
modified ghost ring.
Given the modified ghost coordinates, and computing only in the modified ghost ring, we can
use Newton’s relations formally to compute the appropriate Witt coordinates.
Example 8.20. We consider (0, a) ∗ (0, b) = 2V 2 (ab). We compute the modified ghost coordinates
0

4V 1 (ab)

0

4V 1 (a2 b2 )

0

4V 1 (a3 b3 )

0

4V 1 (a4 b4 )

First, −σ1 = p1 = 0.
The second term is computed as follows: −2σ2 = −σ1 p1 − p2 , and p2 is 2V 1 (ab) = V 1 (2ab) (in
≥1
V /V ≥2 !)
Continuing, we compute
−4σ4 = −σ3 p1 + σ2 p2 + −σ1 p3 − p4
= 0 + 2V 1 (ab)4V 1 (ab) − 4V 1 (ab)V 1 (ab)
= 4V 1 (a2 b2 )
so σ4 = V 1 (−(ab)2 ), etc.
The Teichmüller normal form is then given by
V 1 (σ1 ) + V 2 (σ2 ) + V 3 (σ3 ) + V 4 (σ4 ) + · · ·
where σ i denotes the lift of σi ∈ V ≥1 /V ≥2 to W (A). In our current example, the sum becomes
V 2 (V 1 (2ab)) + V 4 (V 1 (−(ab)2 )) + · · · = V 2 (2ab) + V 4 (−(ab)2 ) + · · ·
So, by use of the correct definitions, we have avoided ever having to mention ghost coordinates
in the definition of the ring of Witt vectors, or to prove any of their basic properties and identities.
Indeed, that would be akin to diagonalizing a matrix, or putting it into a normal form, to prove
all matrix identities. However, in some cases a normal form is convenient, for instance, in testing
for equality. To this end, we have given a procedure for translating into Witt coordinates, which,

FACETS OF THE WITT VECTORS

27

again, should be thought of as recording traces. By the defining the trace correctly, we have also
avoided issues with torsion — the ring elements never mix with Z at inopportune moments.
Before closing this section, we note that the universal Witt polynomials can be computed quite
quickly using a combination of the presentation of W (A) and the procedure above.
9. Higher Structures
In this section, we make some conjectures and observations that we will return to in future work.
Since nothing is proved in this section, we will content ourselves with sketches. The reader who,
for mysterious reasons, is not interested in higher algebraic K-theory or topological Hochschild
homology may comfortably skip this section.
e 0 (End(A)) may be realized as the group of components of an algebraic K-theory
The group K
spectrum. To see this, we note that the category of endomorphisms is appropriate for input into
one of the algebraic K-theory machines: the category End(A) is an exact or Waldhausen category
in the sense of [17] or [18]. What is more surprising is that this is true of the V -filtration as well.
Proposition 9.1. Let V ≥k End(A) be the thick subcategory generated by images of V i with i ≥ k.
Then V ≥k End(A) is a Waldhausen category.
Thus, V ≥k End(A) may be fed into an algebraic K-theory machine. This entitles us to the
following surprising definition.
Definition 9.2. The V -filtration on the algebraic K-theory of endomorphisms is given by
V ≥k K(End(A)) := K(V ≥k End(A)) := Ω|S• V ≥k End(A)|
Taking algebraic K-theory of the filtered category, we obtain maps of spectra
···

V ≥2 K(End(A))

V ≥1 K(End(A))

∼
=

K(End(A))

which upon taking homotopy cofibers gives a pro-spectrum
∗

K(End(A))/V 2

K(End(A))/V 3

K(End(A))/V 4

···.

In analogy with the case of K0 , we make the following definition.
e
Definition 9.3. The V -completion of K(End(A))
is

j
e
holim K(End(A))/V

Based on the work above, it seems reasonable to make the following conjecture
Conjecture 9.4. There is a weak equivalence of spectra
j
e
holim K(End(A))/V

TR(A)

where TR(A) is topological restriction homology.

e
That is, we conjecture that TR(A) can be constructed directly from K(End(A))
without reference
e
to topological Hochschild homology. One can also show that K(End(A)) is an S 1 -ring spectrum,
and so the homotopy groups acquire a differential. It should be that the homotopy groups of
e
V -completion of K(End(A))
are very closely related to the big de Rham-Witt complex [15].
A related, easier, conjecture is the following.

More speculatively, one could posit that K(End(A))/V is a more canonical version of THH, or
perhaps equivalent to THH. In fact, K(End(A)) is a cyclotomic spectrum 1, and we conjecture the
following.
Conjecture 9.6. There is a weak equivalence of S 1 -spectra

and the topological Dennis trace is given by the truncation map
e
K(End(A))

≥2 e
e
V ≥1 K(End(A))/V
K(End(A))

Remark 9.7. This is a “derived” version of the trace map defined for K0 above.
Exactly what THH “is” has always been a been of a mystery to the author. Among other reasons,
e
it could be that THH is simply the first truncation of a much more natural object — K(End(A)).
We also point out that this is expressing something like the fact that THH(A) is the “tangent space”
e
of K(End(A)).
Such intuition has been in the air for a very long time, and it would be pleasant to
make it precise via this perspective.
Finally, for general Waldhausen categories C there is no good definition of THH: the input for
THH is either a spectrally enriched category, or a category with enough structure that it can be
spectrally enriched (see, e.g. [9, 4]). But there is still a Verschiebung map on End(C) for any
Waldhausen category. Thus, we propose the following.
Conjecture 9.8. Let C be a Waldhausen category. The definition of THH(C) should be
≥2
e
THH(C) := K(End(C))/V
We are addressing these conjectures in work in progress.
