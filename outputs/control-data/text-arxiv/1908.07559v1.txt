Λ-LINKED COUPLING FOR DRIFTING BROWNIAN MOTIONS
MOTOYA MACHIDA
Abstract. We raise a question on whether a dynamical system driven by
Markov process is Markovian, for which we are able to propose a criterion and
examples of positive case. This investigation leads us to develop (i) a general
construction of intertwining dual via Liggett duality, and (ii) a realization of
Λ-linked coupling in a form of dynamical system. We show this construction
of intertwining dual and Λ-linked coupling for an n-dimensional drifting Brownian motion when it is a characteristic diffusion. In particular, it includes an
extension of Pitman’s 2M − W theorem by Rogers and Pitman as a special
case.

1. Introduction
This study was inspired by the recent development for intertwining duals by Fill
and Lyzinski [4] and Miclo [12]. In this section we consider a diffusion operator
Af = −µ

of one-dimensional Brownian motion with constant drift (−µ), and illustrate the
connection between Liggett and intertwining duality (Section 1.1 and 1.2), our
notion of flow by Skorohod equations (Section 1.3), and our construction of Λlinked coupling (Section 1.4). In particular, we demonstrate how the realization of
Λ-linked coupling can be related back to the work of Rogers and Pitman [16].
1.1. Liggett dual. A process without drift term is a Brownian motion, and denoted by W (t). Then a sample path X̂(s) of drifting Brownian motion is constructed by
(1.1)

X̂(s) = x − µs + W (s),

s ≥ 0,

starting from an initial state X̂(0) = x; in this paper we use a caret-shaped symbol
X̂(s) or a process W (s) with time s when we view them as processes moving
backward in time. We set
(1.2)

D∗ = {(z, y) ∈ R2 : z < y}

as a state space dual to D = R, and construct a D∗ -valued process X ∗ (t) =
(Z(t), Y (t)) by
(
Y (t) = y + µt − W (t);
(1.3)
Z(t) = z + µt + W (t),
starting from X ∗ (0) = (z, y) ∈ D∗ until the absorbing time ζ = inf{t ≥ 0 : Z(t) =
Y (t)} (and X ∗ (t) remains at a coffin state for t ≥ ζ; see III.3 of [17]).

Theorem 1.1. Let T > 0, x ∈ D, and x∗ = (z, y) ∈ D∗ be fixed. Then X̂ and X ∗
satisfy E[Γ(x∗ , X̂(T ))] = E[Γ(X ∗ (T ), x)] with respect to the duality function
(
1 if z < x ≤ y;
(1.4)
Γ((z, y), x) =
0 otherwise,
where Γ(X ∗ (T ), x) = 0 if T ≥ ζ.
Proof. Use a common Brownian motion W (t), and construct a sample path of X̂(s)
and X ∗ (t). Set M (T ) = max0≤v≤T W (v), and observe that ζ > T if and only if

M (T ) < y−z

Liggett [10] introduced the duality relation of Theorem 1.1, notably including
a notion of duality by Siegmund [20], and we call X ∗ (t) of Theorem 1.1 a Liggett
dual to X̂(s).
1.2. Intertwining dual. The drifting Brownian motion (1.1) has the transition
density function p(t, x, y) = (2πt)−1/2 exp(−|y − x + µt|2 /2t), and it is “timereversible” with respect to an invariant function ν(x) = e−2µx (i.e., ν-symmetric;
see Section 2), satisfying ν(x)p(t, x, y) = ν(y)p(t, y, x). In Section 2 we briefly
review a diffusion process by means of differential operator, Markov semigroup,
and stochastic differential equation (SDE). Unlike one-dimensional diffusions an
invariant function ν does not necessarily exist when a higher dimensional space is
considered. In Definition 2.1 we present a special case of characteristic diffusion
by which an n-dimensional drifting Brownian motion is designed to achieve any
invariant function of interest.
The Liggett dual (1.3) has the corresponding diffusion operator

We define a Markov kernel density λ from D∗ to D by
1
λ((z, y), x) =
Γ((z, y), x)ν(x)
h(z, y)
and introduce the corresponding Markov kernel Λ by
Z y
1
ν(x)f (x)dx
Λf (z, y) =
h(z, y) z
for any bounded measurable function f on D. Then B ∗ satisfies ΛAf = B ∗ Λf, and
it is called an intertwining dual to A. In a setting of Markov chains Diaconis and
Fill [3] observed that an intertwining dual can be viewed as a Doob h-transform
of the Siegmund dual of the time-reversed Markov chain, and Fill and Lyzinski [4]
demonstrated the analogous result for diffusions on [0, 1]. The above construction
of intertwining dual coincides with the one obtained by Miclo [12].
In general the intertwining duality can be introduced between two Markov semigroups Pt and Q∗t , namely by ΛPt = Q∗t Λ. In Chapter 3 we present intertwining
duality in terms of Markov semigroups, and discuss a general construction of intertwining dual. Once a Liggett dual Qt is constructed, the Doob h-transform Q∗t is
an intertwining dual to Pt ; see Proposition 3.4.
1.3. Skorohod equations and flow. Let y ∈ R and T > 0 be fixed. Provided a
sample path X = (X(t))0≤t≤T , we can impute a Brownian motion ω(t) by
ω(t) = X(t) − X(0) − µt,

0 ≤ t ≤ T,

as if X(t) were governed by X(t) = X(0) + µt + ω(t). If y ≥ X(0), we can set a
nondecreasing process
L(t) = − min [y − X(0) − 2ω(v)] ∧ 0
0≤v≤t

starting from L(0) = 0. This process L(t) is uniquely determined as a solution Y (t)
and L(t) to the following equations of Skorohod type

Y (t) = y + µt − ω(t) + L(t);
Z t
(1.5)
L(t) =
I{X(v)=Y (v)} dL(v),
0

which was first proposed by Saisho and Tanemura [19]. The solution Y (t) becomes
an upper bound for X(t), and maintains Y (t) − X(t) = y − X(0) − 2ω(t) + L(t) for
0 ≤ t ≤ T . Then we can construct a flow
(
(−ω(t))0≤t≤T
if X(0) > y;
(1.6)
Θ̃y,T (X) =
(ω(t) − L(t))0≤t≤T if y ≥ X(0),
which maps from a sample path (X(t))0≤t≤T to a sample path Θ̃y,T (X) on the
interval [0, T ].

Proposition 1.2. Construct (X̂(s))0≤s≤T by (1.1) using a Brownian motion W (t),
and set the backward sample path X̂(T − ·) = (X̂(T − t))0≤t≤T . Then Θ̃y,T (X̂(T −
·))(T ) is distributed as W (T ).
Proof. We set X ′ (t) = x − µT + W (T − t) and Y ′ (T ) = y − Θ̃y,T (X̂(T − ·))(T ), and
complete the proof by claiming that Y ′ (T ) is distributed as y + W (T ). Observe
that ω(t) = W (T − t) − W (T ) by imputation, and that {X̂(T ) > y} = {X ′ (0) >
y} = {Y ′ (T ) < x − µT } by (1.6). For u ≥ 0 we can immediately obtain
P(Y ′ (T ) < x − µT − u) = P(y + W (T ) < x − µT − u)

For u ≥ x we can observe that

If y ≥ u − µT then by setting M (T ) = max0≤v≤T W (v) we can apply the reflection
principle (as in the proof of Theorem 1.1) and reduce the above expression to
P(2(u − µT ) − y ≤ x − µT + W (T ) ≤ y)

+ P (x + M (T ) ≥ u, x − µT + W (T ) < 2(u − µT ) − y)

= P(y + W (T ) ≥ 2u − x − µT ).

The case for y < u − µT is similarly argued.

1.4. Λ-linked coupling. The notion of Λ-linked coupling was originally proposed
by Diaconis and Fill [3] in the setting of Markov chains. In Section 3 we propose a general construction for the desirable properties of Λ-linked coupling when
characteristic diffusions of Definition 2.1 are considered.
In a construction of X ∗ (T ) by (1.3) we use the flow Θ̃y,T (X)(T ) of (1.6) in the
place of W (T ). It defines a map Ψ∗T ((z, y), X) from a sample path (X(t))0≤t≤T to
(Z(T ), Y (T )) by
(
Y (T ) = y + µT − Θ̃y,T (X)(T );
(1.7)
Z(T ) = z + µT + Θ̃y,T (X)(T ).
until the absorbing time ζ = inf{t ≥ 0 : Z(t) = Y (t)}.
Theorem 1.3. Let T > 0 and x∗ ∈ D∗ be fixed. Then (a) provided any sample path
X = (X(t))0≤t≤T , X ∗ (T ) = Ψ∗T (x∗ , X) satisfies Γ(x∗ , X(0)) = Γ(X ∗ (T ), X(T )),
and (b) provided the backward sample path X̂(T − ·) = (X̂(T − t))0≤t≤T of Proposition 1.2, Ψ∗T (x∗ , X̂(T − ·)) is distributed as X ∗ (T ) of (1.3).
Proof. (a) If X(0) ≤ z or X(0) > y then Γ(X ∗ (T ), X(T )) = 0. If z < X(0) ≤ y then
(Y (t))0≤t≤T is a solution to (1.5), by which we can easily verify Γ(X ∗ (T ), X(T )) =
1. (b) is an immediate consequence of Proposition 1.2.

A relationship with Liggett dual can be observed when we set X ∗ (T ) = Ψ∗T (x∗ , X̂(T −
·)) as in Theorem 1.3(b). Since Γ(x∗ , X̂(T )) = Γ(X ∗ (T ), X̂(0)) by Theorem 1.3(a),
it provides an alternative proof for Theorem 1.1. Furthermore, a remarkable connection to intertwining dual can be established in a construction of X ∗ (t) by (1.7).

Here we sample X(0) randomly from λ(x∗ , ·), and generate a Markov process X(t)
by
X(t) = X(0) − µt + W (t), t ≥ 0.
The resulting bivariate process (X ∗ (t), X(t)) is Markovian, and it becomes a Λlinked coupling of Theorem 3.3; see Proposition 3.5. By Theorem 3.3 the Markov
process X ∗ (t) = (Z(t), Y (t)) is governed by the intertwining dual operator B ∗ .
The bivariate process U (t) = [Y (t) + Z(t)]/2 and V (t) = [Y (t) − Z(t)]/2 has the
diffusion operator
∂f
1 ∂2f
∂f
;
+ 2µ coth(2µv)
+
∂u
∂v
2 ∂v 2
in particular, V (t) becomes a Bessel process
B∗f = µ

dV (t) = 2µ coth(2µV (t)) dt + dW (t)
for the drifting Brownian motion W (t) − 2µt. It can start from V (0) = 0, and
never hits 0 again; see further discussion in Section 8.1. Thus, starting from
(X ∗ (0), X(0)) = ((0, 0), 0), the coupling satisfies Y (t)−X(t) = 4µt−2W (t)+2M (t)
with
2M (t) = 2 max [W (v) − 2µv] .
0≤v≤t

Therefore, it provides a construction of V (t) by
V (t) = 2M (t) − [W (t) − 2µt].

This sample path construction was obtained by Pitman [15] for µ = 0, and extended
by Rogers and Pitman [16]. Their results are collectively called Pitman-type 2M −
W theorems, and were extensively studied by Matsumoto and Yor [11] and many
others cited therein.
Intertwining duality has been studied in relation with the question of when a
function φ(X(t)) of a Markov process X(t) is Markovian; see [14] for a brief review
of the literature. General criteria such as Theorem 2 of [16] for the Markovian
question were used for the sample path construction of V (t). In the present paper we
raise the question of when a “random” dynamical system Ψ∗t (x∗ , X) is Markovian,
provided that X is a Markov process. As demonstrated in this section, our criterion
(Proposition 3.5) for this new question on Ψ∗t (x∗ , X) can be successfully applied to
the analysis of diffusion process V (t).
The Λ-linked coupling of Theorem 3.3 also implies that the regular conditional
probability distribution P(X(t) ∈ ·|X ∗ (t) = (z, y)) has a probability density function (pdf) on (z, y] proportional to the invariant function ν(x) = e−2µx . The
equivalent observation was made by [16] that P([B(t) − 2µt] ∈ ·|V (t) = y) has a
pdf on (−y, y] proportional to e−2µx .
1.5. Outline for the rest. In Section 4 we begin our investigation of an ndimensional drifting Brownian motion X(t) and its time-reversed X̂(s) with Euler
approximations. Euler schemes and other forms of algorithm in approximation are
necessary ingredient in describing a general construction of stochastic processes
when they are elaborately coupled. In Section 5 we propose a stochastic process
∂Y ∗ (t) of hypographical surface as an upper bound for X(t), and present a coupled
construction with time-reversed X̂(s) in Algorithm 5.5. In Section 6 we examine it
with equations of Skorohod type, which leads us to a construction of Liggett dual
in Proposition 6.6. A coupled construction of X(t) and ∂Y ∗ (t) forward in time

(Algorithm 7.1) enables us to define an n-dimensional version of flow. In Section 7
we present a stronger version of Proposition 1.2 (namely Proposition 7.11), claiming that the flow (1.6) is distributed as the Wiener measure on the interval [0, T ].
Together we are able to construct a Λ-linked coupling in Proposition 7.12.
Kent [8] observed that a drifting Brownian motion can be designed for arbitrary
invariant function ν(x) on Rn (characteristic diffusions; see Definition 2.1). In
Section 5.1 we present three examples of characteristic diffusion, and use them to
illustrate a construction of hypographic surface. In Section 6.2 we continue our
exploration for examples of Liggett dual. The exploration culminates in Section 8
for the construction of intertwining dual for each case of the examples. In particular,
we consider a posterior density νH (x) on a hyperplane H in Example 5.4, and look
at a possibility of Monte Carlo simulation out of Example 6.9 and 8.4.

we denote the adjoint operator of A. In what follows we assume that the drift
coefficients βi (x)’s are smooth enough (differentiability and Hölder continuity for
their derivatives) so that a fundamental solution exists; see [5, 7, 21] for sufficient
conditions for existence and uniqueness. Thus,R the differential operator A uniquely
determines a positive and conservative [i.e., p(t, x, y) dy = 1] transition density
function p(t, x, y). It satisfies the parabolic equations

which are respectively referred as Kolmogorov backward and forward equation.
Let R+ be the half line [0, ∞), and let C(R+ , Rn ) be the space of all continuous
functions from R+ to Rn . In terms of SDE the distribution determined by (2.1)
corresponds to a solution to
(2.2)

dX(t) = −β(X(t))dt + dW (t),

where β(x) = [β1 (x), . . . , βn (x)]T is the column vector of drift coefficients and
W (t) is an n-dimensional Brownian motion. That is, the solution X(t) starting at
X(0) = x corresponds to the probability measure Px on C(R+ , Rn ) which satisfies

probability measure Px for any measurable function F on C(R+ , Rn ).

A strictly positive function ν on Rn is called invariant if it satisfies
Z
ν(y) = ν(x)p(t, x, y) dx

for any t > 0 and y ∈ Rn . Then

p̃(t, x, y) =

ν(y)
p(t, y, x)
ν(x)

is the time-reversed transition density with respect to ν, and it satisfies

p̃(t, x, y) =
A† [ν(x)p̃(t, x, y)].
∂t
ν(x) x
The transition density function p is called ν-symmetric if p = p̃. Kent showed (in
Section 4 of [8]) that p is ν-symmetric if and only if the operators A and A† satisfy

∂
Ax f (x) = ν(x)
A†x [ν(x)f (x)], which is equivalently characterized by 21 ∂x
ν = −βi ν
i
for i = 1, . . . , n.
Definition 2.1. Let γ be a real-valued function on Rn , and let ν(x) = exp(−2γ(x)).
We call (2.1) a characteristic diffusion for ν if the drift coefficient βi satisfies βi =
∂
∂xi γ for each i = 1, . . . , n.
In Definition 2.1 the scalar function −γ(x) is regarded as a potential energy, and
β(x) is the gradient ∇γ(x). Then ν is invariant, and the transition density p is
ν-symmetric (Section 4 of [8]).
Lemma 2.2. Let Px be the probability measure determined by a characteristic diffusion of Definition 2.1, and let T > 0 be fixed. Assuming that a function FT on
C([0, T ], Rn ) is integrable in either side of (2.4), we have
Z

Proof. It suffices to show (2.4) for FT (X) = i=0 IEi (X(ti )) with Borel subsets Ei ’s
of R and 0 = t0 < · · · < tN = T (cf. Section II-38 of [17]), where IEi (x) denotes
the indicator function on Ei . Then the left-hand side of (2.4) can be expressed as

By repeatedly applying the ν-symmetry of p we can verify that they are equal. 
In general a diffusion operator B is accompanied with domain DB , and
R it uniquely
determines a sub-Markov semigroup Qt . When Qt is conservative [i.e., Qt (x, dy) =
1], we can correspond it to a probability measure Qx in the same way we have constructed Px satisfying (2.3). Furthermore, it characterizes a weak solution of SDE
as Qx represents a solution to martingale problem satisfying the Dynkin’s formula

which corresponds to the analytical relationship between B and Qt for f ∈ DB ; see
Section V.20 of [17].
3. Λ-linked coupling
In the rest of this paper we set D = Rn , and consider a semigroup Pt on D
for characteristic diffusion (Definition 2.1). We introduce another Polish space D∗
as a “dual” state space. It is assumed that D∗ is open relative to its extension
D̄∗ = D∗ ∪ ∂, and that D̄∗ is Polish with different choice of metric.
Definition 3.1. Let (ψt )t≥0 be a family of measurable maps ψt from D̄∗ ×C([0, t], Rn )
to D̄∗ , and let ζ(x, ω) = inf{t ≥ 0 : ψt (x, ω) ∈ ∂} be a map from D∗ × C(R+ , Rn )
to R+ ∪ {∞}. Then ψt is said to be a dynamical system driven by a Markovian
“noise” ω ∈ C(R+ , Rn ) according to some probability measure on C(R+ , Rn ) if
for each (x, ω) ∈ D∗ × C(R+ , Rn ) (a) ψ0 (x, ω) = x, and (b) ψt (x, ω) is continuous on t ∈ [0, ζ(x, ω)). Furthermore, it is called a Markov dynamical system if
it also satisfies ψt (x, ω) = ψt−s (ψs (x, ω), ω(· + s)), 0 ≤ s < t < ζ(x, ω), for each
(x, ω) ∈ D∗ × C(R+ , Rn ).
A Markov dynamical system ψt is usually driven by the Wiener measure W, and
the corresponding Markov process
 (until terminated) is determined by the subMarkov semigroup Qt f (x) = EW f (ψt (x, ω))I{t<ζ(x,ω)} , where I{t<ζ(x,ω)} is the
indicator function of {t < ζ(x, ω)}. Using a Brownian motion W and an initial
value X(0) = x, a Markov process X(t) can be expressed by X(t) = ψt (x, W ) until
the absorbing time ζ(x, W ).
3.1. Λ-linked coupling. A Markov kernel density λ(x∗ , x) fromR D∗ to D is called
a link. In particular, λ(x∗ , ·) is a probability density on D [i.e., λ(x∗ , x)dx = 1].

Definition 3.2. We assume that E = {(x∗ , x) ∈ D∗ × D : λ(x∗ , x) > 0} is Polish.
Let Q∗t be a Markov semigroup on D∗ , and let Vt be a Markov semigroup on E. Then
Vt is said to be Λ-linked between Pt and Q∗t if (a) Vt f = Pt f for f (x∗ , x) = f (x)
on E, and (b)
Z
Z
Z
(3.1)
λ(x∗ , x)Vt g(x∗ , x) dx = Q∗t (x∗ , dy ∗ ) λ(y ∗ , y)g(y ∗ , y) dy

for any x∗ ∈ D∗ and for any bounded measurable function g on E.
By Λ we denote the map
∗

Λ[f ](x ) =

Z

λ(x∗ , x)f (x) dx

from bounded measurable functions f on D to bounded measurable functions Λ[f ]
on D∗ . Then the semigroup Vt of Definition 3.2 implies that
Z
Λ[Pt f ] = λ(x∗ , x)Vt f (x) dx
Z
Z
= Q∗t (x∗ , dy ∗ ) λ(y ∗ , y)f (y) dy = Q∗t [Λf ];

thus, Pt and Q∗t are “Λ-linked.” It is common to call Q∗t an intertwining dual of Pt
with respect to Λ when ΛPt = Q∗t Λ holds. The corresponding infinitesimal operator
B ∗ of Q∗t , if it exists, is an intertwining dual of A if ΛA = B ∗ Λ.

When a Markov process (X ∗ (t), X(t)) is generated by the Markov semigroup
Vt of Definition 3.2, the marginal distribution of X ∗ (t) may not be Markovian.
However, we obtain the result similar to Theorem 2 of [16].
Theorem 3.3. Fix x∗0 ∈ D∗ , and construct a probability measure Vλ(x∗ ,·) on
C(R+ , E) satisfying for 0 = t0 ≤ t1 < · · · < tN ,
Vλ(x∗0 ,·) ((X ∗ (ti ), X(ti )) ∈ dx∗i × dxi , i = 1, . . . , N )

Then X (t) is Markovian with initial state X ∗ (0) = x∗0 , and governed by the Markov
semigroup Q∗t .

We call the probability measure Vλ(x∗ ,·) of Theorem 3.3 a Λ-linked coupling. It
satisfies
Vλ(x∗ ,·) ((X ∗ (t), X(t)) ∈ dy ∗ × dy) = Q∗t (x∗ , dy ∗ )λ(y ∗ , y) dy,
which allows us to derive a regular conditional probability
(3.2)

Vλ(x∗ ,·) (X(t) ∈ dy|X ∗ (t) = y ∗ ) = λ(y ∗ , y)dy

for t > 0.
3.2. Liggett dual. Let Qt be a sub-Markov semigroup on D∗ , and let Γ(x∗ , x) be
a bounded nonnegative measurable function on D∗ × D. Then Qt is said to be a
Liggett dual of Pt with respect to Γ if

The Liggett dual Qt of Proposition 3.4 may not be conservative, but it can
be extended to a Markov semigroup over D̄∗ = D∗ ∪ ∂. We can generate a
Markov process X ∗ on D̄∗ by Qt with exit boundary ∂. If Qt is conservative,
no Markov process started in D∗ reaches the coffin state. By setting the terminal
time ζ = inf{t ≥ 0 : X ∗ (t) ∈ ∂} accompanied with X ∗ , we can view it as a Markov
process X ∗ (t) over D∗ defined for the duration [0, ζ). For a duality function Γ it
is understood customarily that Γ(X ∗ (t), x) = 0 if t ≥ ζ, or equivalently that Γ is
extended over D̄∗ × D by setting Γ(x∗ , x) = 0 for all x∗ ∈ ∂.
In the next proposition we consider the link λ of Proposition 3.4, and the probability measure Px on C(R+ , D) corresponding to the semigroup Pt . We also assume
that E = {(x∗ , x) ∈ D∗ ×D : Γ(x∗ , x) > 0} is Polish. Let Ψ∗t be a dynamical system
of Definition 3.1 from D̄∗ × C([0, t], D) to D̄∗ .
Proposition 3.5. Assume that (a) for any x∗ ∈ D̄∗ , X ∈ C(R+ , D), and t > 0,
Γ(x∗ , X(0)) = Γ(Ψ∗t (x∗ , X), X(t))

(3.4)
holds, (b) for each t > 0

Qt f (x∗ ) = EPx [f (Ψ∗t (x∗ , X(t − ·))],

x∗ ∈ D̄∗

defines a Markov semigroup on D̄∗ uniquely regardless of the initial state X(0) = x,
and (c) (Ψ∗t (x∗ , X), X(t)) is Markovian whenever X(t) is Markovian. Then the
semigroup
Vt g(x∗ , x) = EPx [g(Ψ∗t (x∗ , X), X(t))],
is Λ-linked between Pt and Q∗t of Proposition 3.4.

(x∗ , x) ∈ E,

Proof. Obviously we have Vt f = Pt f if f (x∗ , x) = f (x) on E. To show (3.1), we

We call Ψ∗t of Proposition 3.5 Λ-linked. By setting f (y ∗ ) = Γ(y ∗ , x) in Proposition 3.5(b) we can observe that
Qt Γ(·, x)(x∗ ) = EPx [Γ(Ψ∗t (x∗ , X(t − ·), x)] = EPx [Γ(x∗ , X(t))].
Thus, the existence of Λ-linked dynamical system Ψ∗t of Proposition 3.5 implies
that Qt is a Liggett dual of Pt .
4. Stochastic processes by approximation
Let Φt be a Markov dynamical system from Rn × C([0, t], Rn ) to Rn driven by
the Wiener measure W. We call Φt a strong solution if X(t) = Φt (x, W ) is a unique
solution to (2.2) with initial condition X(0) = x (cf. Theorem IV-1.1 of [6]). Such
a strong solution Φt exists if β is locally Lipschitz continuous (cf. Theorem IV-3.1
of [6]). In this paper we assume that the drift coefficient β is smooth with bounded
first derivatives; thus, it has a Lipschitz constant Kβ .
Here we view (2.2) as a time-reversed process X̂(s) backward in time s. The
strong solution Φs forms a diffeomorphic map Φs (·, ω̂) from Rn to itself for each
s ≥ 0 and ω̂ ∈ C(R+ , Rn ) (cf. Theorem V-13.8 of [18]). By Φs−1 (·, ω̂) we denote
the inverse map of Φs (·, ω̂) for each ω̂ ∈ C(R+ , Rn ).
4.1. Euler approximation of backward process. Here we fix T > 0, and develop an approximation X̂N (s) for an n-dimensional drifting Brownian motion (2.2).
Set a uniform increment 0 = s0 < · · · < sN = T , and define a map φu by
(4.1)

φu (z, ω̂) = z − β(z)u + ω̂(u) − ω̂(0).

Starting at X̂N (0) = xN , we can recursively construct
(4.2)

X̂N (s) = φs−sk−1 (X̂N (sk−1 ), ω̂(· + sk−1 ))

12

MOTOYA MACHIDA

for sk−1 < s ≤ sk , k = 1, . . . , N . By using a ∧ b = min{a, b} and [c]+ = max{c, 0},
we can formulate (4.2) as
(4.3)

X̂N (s) = xN −

N
X

k=1

β(X̂N (sk−1 ))[(s − sk−1 ) ∧ (sk − sk−1 )]+
+ ω̂(s) − ω̂(0).

Assuming that xN is convergent, the approximation of (4.2) or (4.3) is known to
converge, and called an explicit Euler method for numerical solutions of SDE’s; see,
e.g., Kloeden and Platen [9].
For f ∈ C([0, T ], Rn ) we define the modulus of continuity (cf. Chapter 2 of [2])
by
∆δ f = sup{kf (s + u) − f (s)k : 0 ≤ s < s + u ≤ T, u ≤ δ},

0 < δ ≤ T.

We also set
kf ks = sup{kf (u)k : 0 ≤ u ≤ s},

0 ≤ s ≤ T,

and write |f |s instead of kf ks when f is a scalar function. The lemma below shows
uniform boundedness and equicontinuity of the approximation X̂N .
Lemma 4.1. For any δ > 0 we have
kX̂N kT ≤ eKβ T (kxN k + kβ(0)kT + 2kω̂kT );
∆δ X̂N ≤ (Kβ kX̂N kT + kβ(0)k)δ + ∆δ ω̂.
Proof. Since kβ(X̂N (s))k is bounded by Kβ kX̂N kT + kβ(0)k, by (4.3) we obtain an
upper bound for ∆δ X̂N . Observe for k = 0, . . . , N that
kX̂N (sk )k ≤ kxN k + kβ(0)kT + 2kω̂kT + Kβ

k−1
X
i=0

kX̂N (si )k(si+1 − si ).

Then the upper bound for kX̂N kT is an immediate consequence of the following

version of discrete Gronwall’s inequality: If xk ≤ α + i=0 γi xi for k = 0, . . . , N
Pk−1
with nonnegative α and γi ’s then we have xk ≤ α exp
i=0 γi for k = 0, . . . , N .

Assuming that xN converges to x, a subsequence of {X̂N } converges uniformly
by Ascoli-Arzelà theorem. The limiting process X̂ implies the existence of solution
to
Z s
β(X̂(u)) du + ω̂(s) − ω̂(0).
(4.4)
X̂(s) = x −
0

Since the solution must be unique, the whole sequence {X̂N } must converge uniformly to X̂. Clearly Lemma 4.1 holds for X̂.
4.2. Implicit Euler scheme of forward process. Since the strong solution
Φs (·, ω̂) to (2.2) is a diffeomorphism, we use the backward sample path ω(t − u),
0 ≤ u ≤ t, and obtain a strong solution X(t) = Φ−1
t (x, ω(t − ·)) to
Z t

X(t) = x +

We set the forward time increment tj = T − sN −j , j = 0, . . . , N . Here we assume
a sufficiently small increment δ > 0 (i.e., a sufficiently large N ) so that φu (·, ω̂) is
diffeomorphic for every 0 ≤ u < δ. Starting from XN (0) = xN , we can formulate
an approximation XN (t) to (4.5) recursively by

Provided that xN converges to x, the uniform convergence of XN is an immediate
consequence to the following lemma.
Lemma 4.2. Let δ > 0 be arbitrarily fixed. For a sufficiently large N we have
max kXN (tj )k ≤ 2e2Kβ T (kxN k + kβ(0)kT + 2kωkT );

4.3. Stochastic processes of inverse image. By F0 we denote the space of
nonempty closed subsets in Rn . Equipped with Fell topology F0 is a Polish space,
which is also characterized by Painlevé-Kuratowski convergence (cf. Appendix B of
[13]). Let {x∗N } be a sequence in F0 . The lower limit, denoted by lim inf x∗N , consists
of all the points x such that xN → x with xN ∈ x∗N . The upper limit, denoted
by lim sup x∗N , consists of all the limiting points x of some subsequence {xNk } with
xNk ∈ x∗Nk . The sequence {x∗N } converges to x∗ in the Painlevé-Kuratowski sense,
denoted by x∗ = PK-lim x∗N , if x∗ = lim inf x∗N = lim sup x∗N .
An F0 -valued function F (t) is lower semicontinuous at t = t0 if lim inf F (tN ) ⊇
F (t0 ) for every sequence {tN } converging to t0 , and it is upper semicontinuous
at t = t0 if lim sup F (tN ) ⊆ F (t0 ) for each of such sequences (cf. Appendix D
of [13]). Then F (t) is continuous if it is lower and upper semicontinuous. In the
next theorem we consider a dynamical system ψt from Rn × C([0, t], Rn ) to Rn ,

14

MOTOYA MACHIDA

and introduce a sufficient condition for upper semicontinuity when the F0 -valued
process of inverse image is constructed.
Definition 4.3. Let {sN } be a decreasing or an increasing sequence in R+ . Then
we call a dynamical system ψt consistent if ψs−sN (xN , ω̂(· + sN )) converges to
ψs−s0 (x0 , ω̂(· + s0 )) for each s > s0 whenever (sN , xN ) converges to (s0 , x0 ).
Theorem 4.4. Let x∗ ∈ F0 and ω ∈ C(R+ , Rn ) be fixed, and let ψt be a consistent
dynamical system of Definition 4.3. Assuming that Y ∗ (t) = ψt−1 (x∗ , ω(t − ·)) is
nonempty for all t ≥ 0, Y ∗ (t) is an upper semicontinuous F0 -valued process.
Proof. Definition 4.3 implies that ψt (x, ω(t − ·)) is continuous in x, and therefore,
that Y ∗ (t) takes values on F0 . In order to show upper semicontinuity, we set
a sequence {(tN , zN )} converging (t0 , z0 ) while ψtN (zN , ω(tN − ·)) ∈ x∗ . Without
loss of generality we assume that {tN } is increasing or decreasing. By Definition 4.3
we can observe that limN →∞ ψtN (zN , ω(tN − ·)) = ψt0 (z0 , ω(t0 − ·)), and therefore,
that z0 ∈ Y ∗ (t0 ).

In the case of strong solution Φs in Section 4.1 we obtain a continuous F0 -valued
process of inverse image.
Lemma 4.5. The strong solution Φs to (2.2) is consistent.
Proof. Suppose that (sN , xN ) converges to (s0 , x0 ) as in Definition 4.3, and that
T > s0 is arbitrarily fixed. Then the strong solution X̂N (s) = Φs−sN (xN , ω̂(·+sN )),
sN ≤ s ≤ T , satisfies
Z s
β(X̂N (u)) du + ω̂(s) − ω̂(sN ),
X̂N (s) = xN −
sN

and a sequence {X̂N (s)} of processes on [s0 ∨ s1 , T ] is uniformly bounded and
equicontinuous for each N . By extending X̂N (s) to a continuous process on (s0 , T ]
as necessary, we can find a subsequence {X̂Ni (s)} which converges to X̂(s) uniformly on (s0 , T ]. Since X̂(s) must satisfy
Z s
β(X̂(u)) du + ω̂(s) − ω̂(s0 ),
X̂(s) = x0 −
s0

we obtain X̂(s) = Φs−s0 (x0 , ω̂(· + s0 )). The uniqueness of integral equation implies
that the whole sequence {X̂N (s)} must converge to X̂(s) uniformly on (s0 , T ]. 
Proposition 4.6. Let x∗ ∈ F0 and ω ∈ C(R+ , Rn ) be fixed. Then Y ∗ (t) =
∗
Φ−1
t (x , ω(t − ·)) is a continuous F0 -valued process.
Proof. By Theorem 4.4 and Lemma 4.5 Y ∗ (t) is upper semicontinuous. The proof
of lower semicontinuity is naturally related to a selection of continuous process
X(t) ∈ Y ∗ (t) (cf. Chapter 9 of [1]). Suppose that x0 ∈ Y ∗ (t0 ), and that a sequence
{tN } converges to t0 . Then we can construct a strong solution
(
Φt0 −t (x0 , ω(t0 − ·)) if 0 ≤ t < t0 ;
X(t) =
if t0 ≤ t < ∞;
Φ−1
t−t0 (x0 , ω(t − ·))
to (4.5) satisfying X(t0 ) = x0 . Thus, xN = X(tN ) ∈ Y ∗ (tN ) converges to x0 , and
therefore, Y ∗ (t) is lower semicontinuous.

5. Stochastic processes of hypographical surface
By Xi or Xi,N we denote the i-th coordinate of X or XN , and by X(−i) or
X(−i),N we denote the (n − 1)-dimensional vector of X or XN , by deleting the i-th
coordinate. Assuming n ≥ 2, a closed subset x∗ of Rn is said to be hypographic at
the direction of i-th coordinate if there exists a unique upper semi-continuous function h from Rn−1 to R satisfying x∗ = {(xi ; x(−i) ) : xi ≤ h(x(−i) ), x(−i) ∈ Rn−1 }.
We call a hypographic closed subset x∗ “Lipschitz-continuous” if the corresponding
function h of hypograph is Lipschitz-continuous. The boundary ∂x∗ of hypographic
closed set uniquely determines the hypographical surface
(5.1)

∂x∗ = {x ∈ Rn : xi = h(x(−i) )}.

Thus, we denote by ∂x∗ (·) the corresponding function h(·) in (5.1), though it is a
slight abuse of notation.
Definition 5.1. We denote by F1 a subclass of Lipschitz-continuous hypographic
closed sets at the direction of first coordinate, and assume that a process Y ∗ (t) =
∗
Φ−1
t (x , ω(t − ·)) of inverse image takes values on F1 . Then the corresponding
function of hypographical surface at each t, denote by ∂Y ∗ (t, ·), is called a stochastic
process of hypographical surface if for each T ≥ 0 there exists a Lipschitz constant
universally for the collection {∂Y ∗ (t, ·)}0≤t≤T regardless of ω ∈ C([0, T ], Rn ).
5.1. Examples of hypographical surface. A trivial example of hypographical
surfaces is given by
F1 = { x∗ : hypographic with constant ∂x∗ (·) }

if n = 1 or stochastic processes X1 and X(−1) are independent.

Example 5.2. Suppose that n = 1 or an invariant function ν is formulated by
ν(x) = ν1 (x1 )ν2 (x(−1) ). Then the drift coefficient β1 (x) is a function of x1 , and the
hypographical surface ∂Y ∗ (t, ·) ≡ Y1 (t) is determined by dY1 (t) = β1 (Y1 (t))dt +
dW1 (t).
In general neither the initial condition of Y ∗ (0) ∈ F1 nor the Lipschitz-continuity
of β ensures that a closed set-valued process Y ∗ (t) remains on a subclass F1 of
hypographic closed sets.
Example 5.3. Let ν(x) = e−2x1 x2 be an invariant function on R2 . Then we can
find the drift coefficient β(x) = [x2 , x1 ]T , and set
F1 = { x∗ : hypographic with ∂x∗ (x2 ) = (tanh θ)x2 + η for θ, η ∈ R } .

A direction U (t) = [sinh(θ + t), cosh(θ + t)] of the line ∂Y ∗ (t) satisfies dU
dt = β(U ) if
U (0) = [sinh θ, cosh θ]. Thus, given an initial direction U (0) and a point Y (0) on the

16

MOTOYA MACHIDA

line ∂Y ∗ (0), the hypographical surface ∂Y ∗ (t, x2 ) = (U1 (t)/U2 (t))(x2 −Y2 (t))+Y1 (t)
is determined by dU (t) = β(U (t))dt and dY (t) = β(Y (t))dt + dW (t).
n
In the next example
and consider a linear
Pn we view D = R as a parameter space,
regression ha, xi = i=1 ai xi with vector a = [a1 , . . . , an ]T of explanatory variables.
By S(θ) = 1/(1 + e−θ ) we denote the logistic sigmoid function. Then we can
generate a binary output b = 0 or 1 according to the probability S((2b − 1)ha, xi),
and call it a Bernoulli-logistic regression model. In the neural network terminology
this is a unit perceptron with input a and weight vector x. Provided a training
data set {(a(1) , b(1) ), . . . , (a(N ) , b(N ) )} consisting of N input-output pairs, we can
construct the likelihood function

Suppose that the input vectors a(1) , . . . , a(N ) span an (n − 1)-dimensional subspace
H, and that a unit normal vector d to the subspace H has a positive component
d1 = cos θ0 to the first coordinate. Furthermore, it is assumed that
(5.2)

R
so that H ν(x)dx < ∞; thus, in Bayesian viewpoint the function ν(x) on the subspace H is proportional to the posterior density function νH (x) given the flat prior.
Here we can choose θ0 < θ ≤ π/2, and introduce a subclass F1 of hypographic closed
subsets x∗ satisfying |hd, x − yi| ≤ kx − yk| cos θ| for any x, y ∈ ∂x∗ . A Lipschitz
constant for ∂x∗ in F1 is bounded by (kd(−1) k + cos θ)/(d1 − cos θ). Particularly we
have
F1 = {x∗ : hypographic with ∂x∗ = H + c with some c ∈ R }
if θ = π/2.

In Example 5.4 we can construct a process Y ∗ (t) = Φt−1 (x∗ , ω(t − ·)) starting
from Y ∗ (0) = x∗ ∈ F1 . Consider two distinct paths X(t) = Φ−1
t (X(0), ω(t − ·))
∗
and Y (t) = Φ−1
t (Y (0), ω(t − ·)) on ∂Y (t). Then we can introduce the difference
z(t) = X(t) − Y (t) = α(t)d + h(t) in the coordinate system with the vector d and
the subspace H by setting α(t) = hd, z(t)i and h(t) = z(t) − α(t)d. Observe that
z(t) is a solution to the differential equation

and therefore, that α(t) ≡ α(0) and kh(t)k is increasing. Thus, we obtain |α(t)| ≤
kz(t)k| cos θ|, which implies that Y ∗ (t) ∈ F1 .
5.2. A coupled approximation of backward process. By φi,s or ω̂i we denote
the i-th coordinate of φs or ω̂, and by φ(−i),s or ω̂(−i) the (n − 1)-dimensional
vector of φs or ω̂ by deleting the i-th coordinate. Since the maps φi,s (·, ω̂) and
φ(−i),s (·, ω̂) from (4.1) are determined respectively by ω̂i and ω̂(−i) , we can simply
write φi,s (·, ω̂i ) and φ(−i),s (·, ω̂(−i) ). By ω̂ ′ we denote the n-dimensional sample
path
ω̂ ′ (s) = [−ω̂1 (s), ω̂(−1) (s)]

(5.3)

by changing the sign to the path ω̂1 (s) of the first coordinate.
Let T > 0 be fixed, and let ∂YN∗ (t, ·), 0 ≤ t ≤ T , be an approximated process of
hypographical surface by (4.8) with sample path ω ′ starting from ∂YN∗ (0, ·) = ∂y ∗ (·).
Then we set ω̂(s) = ω(T − s) − ω(T ), and view ŶN∗ (s) = YN∗ (T − s), 0 ≤ s ≤ T , as
the time-reversed approximation by
ŶN∗ (s) = φs−sk−1 (ŶN∗ (sk−1 ), ω̂ ′ (· + sk−1 ))

(5.4)

for sk−1 ≤ s < sk , k = 1, . . . , N . Furthermore, we can build a backward process
ŶN (s) of Algorithm 5.5.
Algorithm 5.5. Set ŶN (0) = xN and σ̂N (0) = 0. Provided ŶN (sk−1 ) and
σ̂N (sk−1 ), we can construct ŶN (s) and σ̂N (s) recursively for sk−1 < s ≤ sk ,
k = 1, . . . , N , in the following steps: (i) Update Ŷ(−1),N (s) for sk−1 < s ≤ sk
by
(5.5)

Ŷ(−1),N (s) = φ(−1),s−sk−1 (ŶN (sk−1 ), ω̂(−1) (· + sk−1 )).

(ii) Update σ̂N (s) for sk−1 < s ≤ sk by
(5.6)

σ̂N (s) = σ̂N (sk−1 ) + 2 (ω̂1 (s) − ω̂1 (sk−1 ))

if ŶN (sk−1 ) and Ŷ(−1),N (sk ) satisfy
(5.7)

Ŷ1,N (sk−1 ) − β1 (ŶN (sk−1 ))(sk − sk−1 ) + |ω̂1 (sk ) − ω̂1 (sk−1 )|
> ∂ ŶN∗ (sk , Ŷ(−1),N (sk ));

otherwise, set σ̂N (s) ≡ σ̂N (sk−1 ). (iii) Complete the update of ŶN (s) by setting
(5.8)

Ŷ1,N (s) = φ1,s−sk−1 (ŶN (sk−1 ), (ω̂1 − σ̂N )(· + sk−1 ))

for sk−1 < s ≤ sk .

Algorithm 5.5 constructs an approximation ŶN (s) by (4.2) with backward sample
path
(5.9)

ω̂ σ̂N (s) = [(ω̂1 − σ̂N )(s), ω̂(−1) (s)],

0 ≤ s ≤ T,

and couple it with ŶN∗ (s) recursively in such a way that
(5.10)

Ŷ1,N (sk ) ≤ ∂ ŶN∗ (sk , Ŷ(−1),N (sk ))

for all k = 0, . . . , N if xN ∈ ŶN∗ (0). Here we find σ̂N (sk ) updated by (5.6) only
when ω̂1 (sk ) − ω̂1 (sk−1 ) > 0 holds; thus, by (5.7) we have
(5.11)

∂ ŶN∗ (sk , Ŷ(−1),N (sk )) − 2(ω̂1 (sk ) − ω̂1 (sk−1 )) < Ŷ1,N (sk )

at the k-th update by (5.6).

Lemma 5.6. If the sample path ω̂ of Algorithm 5.5 is distributed as W on C([0, T ], Rn )
then so is ω̂ σ̂N of (5.9).
Proof. We set for each k = 0, . . . , N
(
ω̂ σ̂N (s)
ω̂(s; k) =
[ω̂1 (s) − σ̂N (sk ), ω̂(−1) (s)]

if 0 ≤ s ≤ sk ;
if sk < s ≤ T .

Observe that ω̂(·; 0) = ω̂ and ω̂(·; N ) = ω̂ σ̂N . Then we can prove by induction that
ω̂(·; k) is distributed as W for each k = 1, . . . , N .
Suppose that ω̂(·; k − 1) is distributed as W. Then we obtain (i) ŶN (sk−1 ) from
the initial state xN and the sample path ω̂(s; k − 1) on [0, sk−1 ], and (ii) YN∗ (T − sk )
from the initial state y ∗ and the sample path ω(t) = ω̂(T − t; k − 1) on [0, T − sk ].
Having obtained ŶN (sk−1 ) and ŶN∗ (sk ) = YN∗ (T − sk ), we can determine whether
(5.7) holds or not by the length |ω̂1 (sk ; k − 1) − ω̂1 (sk−1 ; k − 1)| and the vector
ω̂(−1) (sk ; k − 1) − ω̂(−1) (sk−1 ; k − 1). Hence, a sample path
ω̂1σ̂N (u + sk−1 ) − ω̂1σ̂N (sk−1 ),

0 ≤ u ≤ sk − sk−1 ,

is a Brownian motion independent of ω̂1 (s; k−1) on [0, sk−1 ], ω̂1 (s; k−1)− ω̂1 (sk ; k−
1) on [sk , T ], and ω̂(−1) (s; k − 1) on [0, T ]. Consequently, ω̂(·; k) is distributed as
W.

We say that a sequence of stochastic processes is tight or weakly converging if the
sequence of their distributions is tight or weakly converging (cf. Chapter 2 of [2]).
By Lemma 5.6 we can find that ŶN of Algorithm 5.5 is equal in distribution to the
approximation X̂N by (4.2). If X̂N converges weakly to X̂, so does ŶN ; thus, we
obtain the following corollary.
Proposition 5.7. Let xN converge to x in Algorithm 5.5. Assuming the distribution of ω̂ as in Lemma 5.6, ŶN converges weakly to the probability measure Px
of (2.2) on C([0, T ], Rn ).
5.3. Uniform boundedness and equicontinuity. In the setting of Section 5.2
we approximate ∂YN∗ (t, ·) by (4.8), 0 ≤ t ≤ T , with initial state ∂YN∗ (0, ·) = ∂y ∗
and sample path ω ′ . By K∂Y ∗ we denote a Lipschitz constant universally for the
limiting process ∂Y ∗ (t, ·) of hypographical surface, 0 ≤ t ≤ T . We assume that
K∂Y ∗ ≥ 1, and that K∂Y ∗ is also a Lipschitz constant for ∂YN∗ (t, ·), 0 ≤ t ≤ T .
Lemma 5.8. Let {FN (t)} be a uniformly bounded and equicontinuous sequence of
Rn−1 -valued functions on [0, T ]. Then {∂YN∗ (t, FN (t))} is uniformly bounded and
equicontinuous on [0, T ].
Proof. For the boundedness we start from XN (0) = [∂y ∗ (0), 0], and construct
XN (t) by (4.6) with sample path ω ′ . Then we can observe that XN (t) ∈ ∂YN∗ (t),
and that

|∂YN∗ (t, FN (t))| ≤ |X1,N (t)| + K∂Y ∗ kXN,(−1)(t)k + kFN (t)k

√
2kXN (t)k + kFN (t)k .
≤ K∂Y ∗

Since XN (t) and FN (t) are uniformly bounded on [0, T ], so is ∂YN∗ (t, FN (t)).

Secondly for the equicontinuity we start from XN (0) = [∂YN∗ (t, FN (t)), FN (t)],
and construct XN (v) by (4.6) with sample path ω ′ (· + t). Let δ > 0 be arbitrarily
fixed. By observing XN (δ) ∈ ∂YN∗ (t + δ), we obtain
|∂YN∗ (t, FN (t)) − ∂YN∗ (t + δ, FN (t + δ))|

≤ |X1,N (0) − X1,N (δ)| + |∂YN∗ (t + δ, X(−1),N (δ)) − ∂YN∗ (t + δ, FN (t))|

+ |∂YN∗ (t + δ, FN (t + δ)) − ∂YN∗ (t + δ, FN (t))|
√
≤ 2K∂Y ∗ kXN (0) − XN (δ)k + K∂Y ∗ kFN (t) − FN (t + δ)k
√
≤ 2K∂Y ∗ ∆δ XN + K∂Y ∗ ∆δ FN .

Therefore, the equicontinuity of ∂YN∗ (t, FN (t)) is implied by that of XN (t) and
FN (t).

In the following lemma we consider
(5.12) ẐN (s) = xN −

N
X

k=1

β(ŶN (sk−1 ))[(s − sk−1 ) ∧ (sk − sk−1 )]+ + ω̂(s) − ω̂(0)

for 0 ≤ s ≤ T . Then we can observe that Ŷ1,N (s) = Ẑ1,N (s) − σ̂N (s) and
Ŷ(−1),N (s) = Ẑ(−1),N (s). Hence, the investigation of uniformly boundedness and
equicontinuity for ẐN (s) allows us to derive that of σ̂N (s).
Proposition 5.9. Assuming that xN is bounded, σ̂N (s) is uniformly bounded and
equicontinuous on [0, T ].
Proof. If xN 6∈ ŶN∗ (0) then the claim holds obviously for σ̂N = 2ω̂; thus, we assume
in the proof that xN ∈ ŶN∗ (0). Let yN (k) = max0≤i≤k kŶN (si )k and zN (k) =
max0≤i≤k kẐN (si )k for k = 0, . . . , N . Then we can find
zN (k) ≤ xN + 2kω̂kT + kβ(0)kT + Kβ

k−1

i=0

yN (i)(si+1 − si ).

Suppose that the last update by (5.6) is completed over the i-th interval (si−1 , si ]
before sk ; otherwise, set i = 0. Together with (5.10) and (5.11) we can show that
σ̂N (sk ) = σ̂N (si ) ≤ |Ẑ1,N (si )| + |∂ ŶN∗ (si , Ẑ(−1),N (si ))| + 2∆δ ω̂1

By using the construction of XN (t) for the boundedness proof of Lemma 5.8 we
obtain
√
(5.13)
σ̂N (sk ) ≤ 2K∂Y ∗ [zN (k) + kXN kT ] + 2∆δ ω̂

Thus, we can apply the discrete Gronwall’s inequality to yN (k) ≤ zN (k) + σ̂N (sk ),
and demonstrate that yN (T ) is bounded universally regardless of N . By (5.12) we
conclude that ẐN (s) is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous, and by (5.13) that
σ̂N (s) is uniformly bounded.
We can now present the upper bound for |σ̂N (s + δ) − σ̂N (s)| when δ > 0 is
arbitrarily fixed. If no update by (5.6) is completed between s and s + δ then
|σ̂N (s + δ) − σ̂N (s)| ≤ 2∆δ ω̂. Otherwise, we can find the first and the last update
by (5.6) completed respectively at sk and sk′ on [s, s + δ], and observe that
|σ̂N (s + δ) − σ̂N (s)| ≤ 8∆δ ω̂ + |Ẑ1,N (sk′ ) − Ẑ1,N (sk )|

+ |∂ ŶN∗ (sk′ , Ẑ(−1),N (sk′ )) − ∂ ŶN∗ (sk , Ẑ(−1),N (sk ))|.

By using the construction of XN for the equicontinuity proof of Lemma 5.8 we can
find
|∂ ŶN∗ (sk′ , Ẑ(−1),N (sk′ )) − ∂ ŶN∗ (sk , Ẑ(−1),N (sk ))|
√
≤ 2K∂Y ∗ ∆δ XN + K∂Y ∗ ∆δ Ẑ(−1),N .
Thus, the equicontinuity of ẐN (s) implies that of σ̂N (s).



By Lemma 4.1 and Proposition 5.9 we can also find that ŶN (s) is uniformly
bounded and equicontinuous.
6. Skorohod equations
Let κ(s) be a real-valued continuous function. Assuming κ(0) ≥ 0, we call
(6.1)

η(s) = κ(s) + ℓ(s)

a Skorohod equation if η(s) is a nonnegative continuous function and ℓ(s) is a
nondecreasing continuous function with ℓ(0) = 0, satisfying
Z s
I{η(u)=0} dℓ(u),
(6.2)
ℓ(s) =
0

where I{η(u)=0} is the indicator function of a statement {η(u) = 0}, taking values
1 or 0 accordingly as the statement is true or not. Given κ(s), a pair (κ, ℓ) of
functions forms the Skorohod equation, and the nonnegative function η of (6.1) is
uniquely determined by ℓ(s) = − min0≤u≤s [κ(u) ∧ 0].
6.1. Backward Skorohod flow. Let T > 0 be fixed. As in the case of Section 5.2

L̂(s) = 2ω̂1 (s) and ω̂ L̂ (s) = ω̂ ′ (s) for 0 ≤ s ≤ T if x 6∈ Ŷ ∗ (0). Consequently we can
extend ω̂ L̂ to a map
(
ω̂ L̂ (s)
if 0 ≤ s ≤ T ;
Θ̂x,y∗,T (ω̂) =
[ω̂1 (s) − L̂(T ), ω̂(−1) (s)] if s > T ,
from (x, y ∗ , T, ω̂) ∈ Rn × F1 × R+ × C(R+ , Rn ) to C(R+ , Rn ), and call it a backward Skorohod flow. When restricted from ω̂ ∈ C([0, T ], Rn ) to C([0, T ], Rn ), the
backward Skorohod flow is simply denoted by ω̂ L̂ .
Assuming a solution (Ŷ † , L̂) to (6.3)–(6.4), we can introduce

to SDE of Skorohod type is an immediate consequence of the following lemma.
Lemma 6.1. Suppose that x, x‡ ∈ Ŷ ∗ (0), and that (Ŷ † , L̂) and (Ŷ ‡ , L̂‡ ) are solutions to (6.3)–(6.4) with their respective initial states Ŷ † (0) = x and Ŷ ‡ (0) = x‡ .
Then we have
kŶ † − Ŷ ‡ kT ≤ (3 + K∂Y ∗ )kx − x‡ ke(3+K∂Y ∗ )Kβ T
Proof. Accompanying with the respective solutions (Ŷ † , L̂) and (Ŷ ‡ , L̂‡ ), we can

The next proposition establishes the existence of solution to SDE of Skorohod
type.
Proposition 6.2. Assume that xN ∈ ŶN∗ (0) converges to x ∈ Ŷ ∗ (0). Then σ̂N of
Algorithm 5.5 uniformly converges to L̂ of (6.3)–(6.4).
Proof. By Proposition 5.9 we can find a uniformly converging subsequence for
pairs (ŶNi , σ̂Ni ). Clearly the limit σ̂ of σ̂Ni is nondecreasing, and the limit Ŷ
satisfies Ŷ1 (s) ≤ ∂ Ŷ ∗ (s, Ŷ(−1) (s)) for 0 ≤ s ≤ T . Recall that (5.11) holds whenever σ̂Ni (sk ) − σ̂Ni (sk−1 ) > 0. Furthermore, ∂ ŶN∗i (s, Ŷ(−1),Ni (s)) converges uniformly to ∂ Ŷ ∗ (s, Ŷ(−1) (s)) by Lemma 5.8. Thus, for arbitrary ε0 > 0 we can
find sufficiently large Ni so that 0 ≤ ∂ Ŷ ∗ (sk , Ŷ(−1) (sk )) − Ŷ1 (sk ) < ε0 whenever
σ̂Ni (sk ) − σ̂Ni (sk−1 ) > 0, and
σ̂Ni (sl ) =

l
X

k=1

I{0≤∂ Ŷ ∗ (sk ,Ŷ(−1) (sk ))−Ŷ1 (sk )<ε0 } × (σ̂Ni (sk ) − σ̂Ni (sk−1 ))

for l = 1, . . . , Ni . In addition we can choose Ni for arbitrary ε1 > 0 such that
|σ̂Ni − σ̂|T < ε1 / 3T. Therefore, we obtain
σ̂(sl ) −

l
X

k=1

I{0≤∂ Ŷ ∗ (sk ,Ŷ(−1) (sk ))−Ŷ1 (sk )<ε0 } × (σ̂(sk ) − σ̂(sk−1 )) < ε1 ,

which implies that
σ̂(s) =

s

I{0≤∂ Ŷ ∗ (u,Ŷ(−1) (u))−Ŷ1 (u)<ε0 } dσ̂(u).

Since ε0 > 0 is arbitrary, the limit σ̂ must satisfy (6.4) with L̂ = σ̂. Similarly the
limit Ŷ satisfies (6.3). By the uniqueness of solution the whole sequence ŶN and
σ̂N must converge.

We fix (x, y ∗ , T ) ∈ Rn × F1 × R+ , and construct a sequence σ̂N of Algorithm 5.5
with the initial state ŶN (0) = x. (i) Provided x 6∈ ΦT−1 (y ∗ , ω̂ ′ ), we find x 6∈
ŶN∗ (0) for sufficiently large N , and σ̂N (s) = 2ω̂1 (s), 0 ≤ s ≤ T . (ii) Provided
∗
∗

∗
x ∈ Φ−1
T (y \ ∂y , ω̂ ), we find x ∈ ŶN (0) for sufficiently large N . By Proposition 6.2 the whole sequence of σ̂N converges uniformly to L̂. Thus, in either
L̂
(i) or
 (ii) σ̂N converges uniformly∗ to′ the
 backward Skorohod flow ω̂ . Since
W ω̂ ∈ C([0, T ], Rn ) : x ∈ Φ−1

the
restriction
of
sample
space on
T
the cases of (i) and (ii) does not change the result of Lemma 5.6. Hence, we obtain
the following corollary to Proposition 6.2.
Corollary 6.3. If a sample path ω̂ is distributed as W on C(R+ , Rn ) then so is
Θ̂x,y∗,T (ω̂).
6.2. Dynamical systems of Liggett dual. For any fixed T > 0 we can define a
map
ψy∗ ,T (x, ω̂) = ΦT (x, Θ̂x,y∗ ,T (ω̂))
∗
′
from (x, y ∗ , ω̂) ∈ Rn ×F1 ×C([0, T ], Rn ) to Rn . When ω̂ is fixed and x ∈ Φ−1
T (y , ω̂ ),
the map ψy∗ ,T (x, ω̂) gives a solution Ŷ † (T ) to (6.3)–(6.4). In terms of distribution
by Corollary 6.3 we can immediately observe

Corollary 6.4. Let ω̂ be distributed as W over C([0, T ], Rn ), and let PT be the
Markov transition kernel for (2.2). Then we have
Z
∗
EW [f (ψy ,T (x, ω̂))] = PT (x, dy)f (y)
for any measurable function f on Rn .

In terms of consistency of dynamical system we obtain the following lemma.
∗

Lemma 6.5. If ψy∗ ,t (x, ω(t − ·)) is restricted on x ∈ Φ−1
t (y , ω (t − ·)) for each t,
then it is consistent.

Proof. Suppose that an increasing or a decreasing sequence {tN } converges to t0 ,
∗
′
and that xN ∈ Φ−1
tN (y , ω (tN − ·)) converges to x0 . Then we must have x0 ∈
−1 ∗
′
Φt0 (y , ω (t0 − ·)) by Proposition 4.6. For each pair (tN , xN ) we can find the
corresponding solution ŶN† (s), 0 ≤ s ≤ tN , to (6.3)–(6.4) of Skorohod type starting
from ŶN† (0) = xN . By Proposition 5.9 the approximations are uniformly bounded
and equicontinuous, and so is {ŶN† (s)} on each interval [0, tN ∧ t0 ]. Similarly to the
proof of Lemma 4.5 we can argue that ŶN† (s) converges uniformly on [0, t0 ) to the
solution Ŷ † (s), 0 ≤ s ≤ t0 , to (6.3)–(6.4) starting from Ŷ † (0) = x0 .

as desired.



Proposition 6.6 generates a pair (Z ∗ (t), Y ∗ (t)) of closed sets on the state space
D until the absorbing time ζ = inf{t ≥ 0 : Z ∗ (t) = Y ∗ (t)}. When restricted as in
Lemma 6.5 the Skorohod map ψy∗ ,t (·, ω(t − ·)) is continuous but not bijective; thus,

Z ∗ (t) = ψy−1

observe that Z ∗ (t) = Φ−1

Ξ∗t ((z ∗ , y ∗ ), ω) = (Φ−1

Example 6.7. In Example 5.2 the hypographical surface ∂Z ∗ (t, ·) ≡ Z1 (t) is determined by dZ1 (t) = β1 (Z1 (t))dt + dW1 (t). Therefore, a Liggett dual of Proposition 6.6 is formed by a stochastic process (Z1 (t), Y1 (t)) with respect to (1.4) on the
dual state space (1.2). The two SDE’s of (Z1 (t), Y1 (t)) correspond to the differential

Hence, the Liggett dual of Theorem 1.1 is viewed as a special case of Proposition 6.6.

Example 6.8. In Example 5.3 the pair ∂Y ∗ (t, x2 ) = (U1 (t)/U2 (t))(x2 − Y2 (t)) +

Example 6.9. We set θ = π/2 in Example 5.4. Then the pair ∂Y ∗ (t) = H + Y (t)
and ∂Z ∗ (t) = H + Z(t) of hypographical surfaces is determined by (Z(t), Y (t)) on
a dual state space
D∗ = {(z, y) ∈ R2n : hd, y − zi > 0}.
We can introduce a duality function Γ((z, y), x) = 1 if hd, y − xi ≥ 0 and hd, x− zi >
0; otherwise, Γ((z, y), x) = 0. Then (Z(t), Y (t)) provides a Liggett dual, and it is

In Example 6.9 we may choose θ0 < θ < π/2 for F1 , and set an initial hyperplane
∂Y ∗ (0) = H1 ∈ F1 not parallel to H. Proposition 6.6 is applicable by setting
F2 = F0 ∪ {∅}, but the exact sample path (Z ∗ (t), Y ∗ (t)) of Liggett dual is no
longer tractable.

(7.1)

X(t) = Φ−1
t (X(0), ω(t − ·)),

0 ≤ t ≤ T,

starting from X(0) = ΦT (x, ω(T − ·)) so that it terminates at X(T ) = x. Provided
X(0) ∈ y ∗ , we can determine a sample path

Assuming a backward sample path ξ(s),

find a backward Skorohod flow ξ̂ L̂ to (6.3)–(6.4). Then a solution to (7.2)–(7.3)

exists if the time-reversed process of (7.1) is X̂(s) = Φs x, ξ̂ L̂ , 0 ≤ s ≤ T . In fact,
we set ω(t) = ξˆL̂ (T − t) − ξ̂ L̂ (T ), and obtain the solution of L(t) = L̂(T ) − L̂(T − t)
ˆ −t)− ξ̂(T ). Thus, we can appropriately call ω L a forward Skorohod
and ω L (t) = ξ(T
flow.
7.1. A coupled approximation of forward process. In order to construct a
forward Skorohod flow by approximation, we take Algorithm 5.5 and run steps
forward in time. Here we start with an entire path XN (t) of approximation by
(4.6) with sample path ω, in which XN (0) converges to X(0). Then we build σN (t)
forward, and generate the sample path
ω σN (t) = [(ω1 − σN )(t), ω(−1) (t)],

which is used to approximate YN∗ (t) recursively.
Algorithm 7.1. Set the initial values
YN∗ (0) = y ∗ ;

UN (0) = ∂y ∗ (X(−1),N (0)),

and σN (0) = 0 at t0 = 0. At the j-th step, provided UN (tj−1 ) and σN (tj−1 ), (i)
set for tj−1 < t ≤ tj
(7.4)
if

σN (t) = σN (tj−1 ) + 2(ω1 (t) − ω1 (tj−1 ))

Remark 7.2. We generate X̂N (s) by (4.2), 0 ≤ s ≤ T , and view the time-reversed
XN (t) = X̂N (T − t) as if it were constructed by (4.6), for which we set ω̂(s) =
ω(T − s) − ω(T ), 0 ≤ s ≤ T . The update by (7.4) in Algorithm 7.1 is determined
by XN (tj ), X(−1),N (tj−1 ), |ω1 (tj ) − ω1 (tj−1 )|, and ∂Y ∗ (tj−1 ), which is generated
by the sample path ω̂(s), 0 ≤ s ≤ T − tj−1 and ω σN (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ tj−1 . In the
context of Algorithm 5.5 we can view ∂YN∗ (tj−1 ) as if it were generated by sample
path ξ = ω σN , and X̂N (T − tj−1 ) = XN (tj−1 ) as if it were updated backward

with ξ̂ σ̂N (s), 0 ≤ s ≤ T − tj−1 , for which we set σ̂N (s) = σN (T ) − σN (T − s).
Hence a version of Lemma 5.6 can be argued for ω σN (t), and the following lemma
is similarly established.
Lemma 7.3. Let XN (t) be the time-reversed one to X̂N (s) of Remark 7.2. If ω is
distributed as W over C([0, T ], Rn ) then so is ω σN of Algorithm 7.1.
In addition to the construction of YN∗ (tj ) in Algorithm 7.1 we can introduce a
series of estimates YN (tj ) in an attempt to predict the point [UN (tj ), X(−1),N (tj )]
for j = 1, . . . , N .
Algorithm 7.4. If j = 1 or σN (t) on the j-th interval (tj−1 , tj ] is updated by (7.4)
then restart

In what follows we assume a Lipschitz constant K∂Y ∗ ≥ 1 for ∂YN∗ (tj ) regardless
of tj and N . Then we can evaluate the proximity of Y1,N (tj ) to the height UN (tj )
of the surface ∂YN∗ (tj ) at X(−1),N (tj ).
Lemma 7.5. Assume that there is the last update of σN (tj ) by (7.4) at the interval
(tj−1 , tj ] before tk in Algorithm 7.1. Then we have

Since YN (tk ) ∈

Under the assumption of Lemma 7.5 we can observe that kXN (ti )k and kYN (ti )k
are not far apart for i = j, . . . , k. At the update by (7.4) we have UN (tj−1 ) ≤
X1,N (tj−1 ) + 2(ω1 (tj ) − ω1 (tj−1 )). Since (ω σN )′ (ti ) − (ω σN )′ (tj ) = ω ′ (ti ) − ω ′ (tj ) for
i = j, . . . , k, XN (ti ) and YN (ti ) are similarly updated. In particular, by Lemma 4.2
we can find an upper bound for max0≤i≤N kXN (ti )k and max0≤i≤N kYN (ti )k regardless of N .
Proposition 7.6. σN (t) is equicontinuous on [0, T ].

Λ-LINKED COUPLING FOR DRIFTING BROWNIAN MOTIONS

Proof. If X(0) 6∈ y ∗ then σN (t) = 2ω1 (t) is equicontinuous; thus, we assume X(0) ∈
y ∗ . Let δ > 0 and 0 ≤ t < t′ ≤ T be fixed such that t′ − t ≤ δ. Clearly we have
|σN (t′ ) − σN (t)| ≤ 4∆δ ω if there is no complete update by (7.4) over the interval
(t, t′ ]; otherwise, we find a series of updates by (7.4), say the first one on (tk1 −1 , tk1 ]
to the last one on (tkℓ −1 , tkℓ ] between t and t′ . Then |σN (t) − σN (t′ )| is bounded
by
|ω1σN (tk1 −1 ) − ω1σN (tkℓ −1 )| + 7∆δ ω1

≤ |U1,N (tk1 −1 ) − U1,N (tkℓ −1 ) − ω1σN (tkℓ −1 ) + ω1σN (tk1 −1 )|
+ |X1,N (tk1 −1 ) − X1,N (tkℓ −1 )| + 11∆δ ω1

We can bound the first term of the upper bound above by

By Lemma 7.5 the above summation is further bounded by Cδ with some constant

7.2. Uniqueness and existence of forward Skorohod flow. Let T > 0 and
y ∗ ∈ F1 be fixed. In order to show the uniqueness of forward Skorohod flow, we
consider two sample paths ω and ξ, and generate two processes X(t) and Y (t)

By Lemma 7.8 we find the uniqueness of forward Skorohod flow, and along with
Proposition 7.6 we are ready for the existence of such a sample path. The proof
requires a version of Lemma 5.8 for ∂YN∗ (t) of Algorithm 7.1 with sample path ω σN
in order to show the uniform convergence of a subsequence ∂YN∗i (t, X(−1),Ni (t)).
Otherwise, the proof of Proposition 7.9 goes exactly as in Proposition 6.2.
Proposition 7.9. Assuming that XN (0) ∈ y ∗ is convergent, σN of Algorithm 7.1
uniformly converges to L of (7.2)–(7.3).

Λ-LINKED COUPLING FOR DRIFTING BROWNIAN MOTIONS

29

The approximation XN (t) for Algorithm 7.1 can be constructed by Remark 7.2.
(i) If X(0) 6∈ y ∗ then we can find XN (0) 6∈ y ∗ for sufficiently large N , and therefore,
obtain σN (t) = 2ω1 (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T . (ii) If X(0) ∈ y ∗ \ ∂y ∗ then XN (0) ∈ y ∗ \ ∂y ∗
holds for sufficiently large N , and therefore, Proposition 7.9 is applicable for σN (t).
Hence, in either (i) or (ii) ω σN (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T , converges uniformly to Θx,y∗,T (ω).
Since W ({ω ∈ C([0, T ], Rn ) : ΦT (x, ω(T − ·)) ∈ ∂y ∗ }) = 0, the restriction of the
sample space on (i)–(ii) does not change the result of Lemma 7.3. Thus, we obtain
the following corollary.
Corollary 7.10. If a sample path ω is distributed as W on C(R+ , Rn ) then so is
Θx,y∗,T (ω).

so that X(v) =
we can define a map

for 0 ≤ v ≤ t. Let y ∗ ∈ F1 . For any fixed T > 0

Θ̃y∗ ,T (X) = ΘX(T ),y∗ ,T (ω)
from (y ∗ , X) ∈ F1 × C([0, T ], Rn ) to C([0, T ], Rn ). The following proposition is
almost a restatement of Corollary 7.10, and it provides a complete claim for what
we started in Proposition 1.2.
Proposition 7.11. Construct X̂(s) = Φs (x, ω(T − ·)), 0 ≤ s ≤ T , using a sample
path ω distributed as W, and impute ω by (7.6) for X(t) = X̂(T − t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T .
Then Θ̃y∗ ,T (X̂(T − ·)) = Θx,y∗,T (ω) is distributed as W on C([0, T ], Rn ).
In Proposition 6.6 we have constructed the Markov dynamical system Ξ∗t of
Liggett dual to (2.2). By replacing ω with Θ̃y∗ ,t (X), we obtain a dynamical system
(7.7)

Ψ∗t ((z ∗ , y ∗ ), X) = Ξ∗t ((z ∗ , y ∗ ), Θ̃y∗ ,t (X))

from D̄∗ × C(R+ , Rn ) to D̄∗ .
Proposition 7.12. Construct the intertwining dual Q∗t of (2.2) from Ξ∗t by Proposition 3.4. Then the dynamical system of (7.7) is Λ-linked.
Proof. (a) Let (z ∗ , y ∗ ) ∈ D̄∗ be fixed. Consider a forward process X(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T ,
by (7.1). (i) If X(0) 6∈ y ∗ then ω ′ = Θ̃y∗ ,T (X), and therefore, X(T ) 6∈ ΦT−1 (y ∗ , ω(T −
·)). (ii) If X(0) ∈ y ∗ then ω L = Θ̃y∗ ,T (X). Provided the backward sample path
ˆ = ω L (T − s) − ω L (T ), X̂(s) = X(T − s), 0 ≤ s ≤ T , is a solution to (6.3)–(6.4).
ξ(s)
Thus, we obtain X(0) = ψy∗ ,T (X(T ), Θ̃y∗,T (X)(T − ·)). Both (i) and (ii) together
implies (3.4). (b) By Proposition 7.11 we can show that


EPx f (Ξ∗T ((z ∗ , y ∗ ), Θ̃y∗ ,T (X̂(T − ·))))
generates the Liggett dual of Proposition 6.6, and that it is independent on the
choice of initial state x ∈ D for X̂. Having verified (c), we can apply Proposition 3.5.

8. Examples of intertwining dual
In order to apply Proposition 3.5 for the Λ-linked dynamical system Ψ∗t of Proposition 7.12, the corresponding harmonic function of (3.3) must be finite and strictly
positive on D∗ . Then we can form a Λ-linked semigroup by


Vt g((z ∗ , y ∗ ), x) = EW g(Ξ∗t ((z ∗ , y ∗ ), Θ̃y∗ ,t (Φ· (x, ω))), Φt (x, ω))
over

E = {((z ∗ , y ∗ ), x) ∈ D∗ × D : x ∈ y ∗ \ z ∗ }.

We can set X ∗ (0) = x∗ ∈ D∗ and sample X(0) randomly from λ(x∗ , ·) for an
initial state. Then we can produce the Λ-linked coupling Vλ(x∗ ,·) by generating X(t) = Φt (X(0), ω), imputing Θ̃y∗ ,t (X) from X, and constructing X ∗ (t) =
Ξ∗t (x∗ , Θ̃y∗ ,t (X)). The resulting bivariate process (X ∗ (t), X(t)) takes values on E,
and determines the intertwining dual Q∗t by
Q∗t g(x∗ ) = EVλ(x∗ ,·) [g(X ∗ (t))].
8.1. Entrance states for intertwining dual. We continue Example 6.7, and
examine a construction of Λ-linked coupling. In the setting of ZProposition 3.4 we


−1
Ξ∗t ((z, y), ω) = Φ−1
t (z, ω(t − ·)), Φt (y, −ω(t − ·)) ,

and generate (X ∗ (t), X(t)) starting from (X ∗ (0), X(0)) = ((x, x), x). It produces a
probability measure on Ē = {((z, y), x) : z ≤ x ≤ y}.
Proposition 8.1. Let (zN ) be an infinite sequence in R converging to x from below,
and let Vλ(x∗N ,·) be the Λ-linked coupling for each x∗N = (zN , x). Then (a) Vλ(x∗N ,·)
converges weakly to the distribution of (X ∗ (t), X(t)), 0 ≤ t < ∞, and (b) X ∗ (t) is
a diffusion process associated with B ∗ .
Proof. We can consider a Polish space RN of infinite sequences, and construct a
probability measure B on RN satisfying B(BN ∈ dbN ) = λ(x∗N , dbN ). Then we sample ((BN ), ω) from B ⊗ W, and generate X(t) = Φt (x, ω) and XN (t) = Φt (BN , ω).
Let T > 0 be fixed. By applying the Gronwall’s inequality to (4.4) we find that
|XN − X|T = O(|zN − x|), and by Lemma 7.8 that |Θ̃x,T (XN ) − Θ̃x,T (X)|T =
O(|zN − x|).
∗
(a) We can generate X ∗ (t) = Ξ∗t ((x, x), Θ̃x,t (X)) and XN
(t) = Ξ∗t (x∗N , Θ̃x,t (XN )),
∗
∗
and verify (cf. the proof of Lemma 7.7) that kXN − X kT = O(|zN − x|). This
implies (via argument of Section 8 of [2]) that Vλ(x∗N ,·) converges weakly to the
distribution of (X ∗ (t), X(t)), 0 ≤ t < ∞.

Bessel process H(t) = h(X ∗ (τt )) satisfying dH(t) =
H(t)
H(0) = 0, and it never hits 0 for t > 0. In this sense boundary points are viewed
as entrance states of the Λ-linked coupling. This connection to three-dimensional
Bessel process was a critical observation in the investigation of Miclo [12].

In the next proposition we choose an initial point X ∗ (0) = (u, z, y) satisfying
h[u2 , −u1 ]T , y − zi = 0 with 0 < u1 < u2 , and sample X(0) from a pdf λ̄(∂y ∗ , ·)
proportional to ν(x1 , x2 ) on the surface ∂y ∗ = {x : h[u2 , −u1 ]T , x − yi = 0}.
The resulting bivariate process (X ∗ (t), X(t)) generates a probability measure on
Ē = {((u, z, y), x) : h[u2 , −u1 ]T , y − xi ≥ 0, h[u2 , −u1 ]T , x − zi ≥ 0, 0 < u1 < u2 }
Proposition 8.3. Let (zN ) be an infinite sequence in R2 converging to z while x∗N =

(u, zN , y) ∈ D+
, and let Vλ(x∗N ,·) be the Λ-linked coupling. Then Proposition 8.1(a)–
(b) holds.

Proof. We can consider a Polish space of infinite sequences (b0 , (bN )) with b0 ∈ ∂y ∗
and bN ∈ R2 , and construct a probability measure B satisfying B(B0 ∈ db0 ) =
λ̄(∂y ∗ , db0 ) and B(BN ∈ dbN ) = λ(x∗N , dbN ); moreover, for each k we can find a
sequence ck,N converging to zero such that B (kBN − B0 k ≤ ck,N , N ≥ 1) ≥ 1−2−k .
Then we sample ((B0 , (BN )), ω) from B ⊗ W, and generate X(t) = Φt (B0 , ω) and
XN (t) = Φt (BN , ω). Having fixed T > 0 and Ak = {(b0 , (bN )) : kbN − b0 k ≤
ck,N , N ≥ 1}, and similarly to the proof of Proposition 8.1 we obtain kXN −XkT =
O(ck,N ), and kΘ̃(u,y),T (XN ) − Θ̃(u,y),T (X)kT = O(ck,N ) if (B0 , (BN )) ∈ Ak .
∗
(a) We can verify kXN
− X ∗ kT = O(ck,N ) over Ak for the construction of
∗
X ∗ (t) = Ξ∗t ((u, z, y), Θ̃(u,y),t (X)) and XN
(t) = Ξ∗t (x∗N , Θ̃(u,y),t (XN )), and obtain
Proposition 8.1(a).
(b) Assuming that f and B ∗ f are bounded, for each ε > 0 we can find sufficiently
large k so that

we can obtain (8.2) for an intertwining dual process X ∗ (t) of Proposition 8.3, and
show that h(X ∗ (t)) never hits 0 for t > 0, as discussed in Section 8.1.
Example 8.4. We continue to choose θ = π/2 from Example 6.9. Then we can
introduce a harmonic function h(z, y) = hd, y −zi for the Liggett dual B, and obtain
the intertwining dual

Similarly to Proposition 8.3 we can set an initial point X ∗ (0) = (z, y) on the
boundary (i.e., hd, y − zi = 0), and sample X(0) ∈ (H + y) randomly so that
X(0) − hd, X(0)id is distributed as the pdf νH (x) proportional to ν(x) on H. The
resulting probability measure V(z,y) of bivariate process (X ∗ (t), X(t)) is the limiting
distribution of the Λ-linked coupling Vλ(x∗N ,·) if a sequence x∗N = (zN , y) ∈ D∗
converges to (z, y), for which Proposition 8.1(a)–(b) is similarly verified. We can
also obtain (8.2) with m(z, y) ≡ 2d1 .

Remark 8.5. (a) As in the discussion of Example 6.9, a hyperplane H1 not parallel
to H can be used for an initial state. Proposition 7.12 is applicable, but a Λ-linked
dynamical system Ψ∗t becomes intractable with the choice of F2 = F0 ∪ {∅}. (b)
In Example 5.4 the input vectors a(1) , . . . , a(N ) can span the entire space Rn , and
ν(x) Rcan be viewed as a posterior density on Rn up to the normalizing constant
zν = Rn ν(x)dx; the finiteness of zν can be checked similarly to (5.2). However, it
∗
is no longer guaranteed that a sample path Y ∗ (t) = Φ−1
t (Y (0), ω(t − ·)) remains
in a subclass F1 of hypographic closed sets.
In spite of Remark 8.5 we conclude this study by suggesting a scheme for Monte
Carlo simulation. In light of (3.2) it can be designed to sample X(T ) ∈ R from
the pdf proportional to ν(x) for some fixed region R of Rn . Set an initial state

∂Z ∗ (0) = ∂Y ∗ (0) = H1 , and sample X(0) ∈ H1 from the pdf proportional to ν(x).
Construct a sample path (X ∗ (t), X(t)) of Λ-linked coupling, and stop it at time
T when R ⊆ Y ∗ (T ) \ Z ∗ (T ). Accept a sample X(T ) from the pdf of interest if
X(T ) ∈ R.
