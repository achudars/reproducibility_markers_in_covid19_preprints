As is well known, crystals have discrete space translational symmetry. It was recently noticed that
one-dimensional crystals possibly have discrete Poincaré symmetry, which contains discrete Lorentz
and discrete time translational symmetry as well. In this paper, we classify the discrete Poincaré
groups on two- and three- dimensional Bravais lattices. They are the candidate symmetry groups
of two- or three-dimensional crystals, respectively. The group is determined by an integer generator
g, and it reduces to the space group of crystals at g = 2.

INTRODUCTION

After the papers by Wilczek and Shapere1,2 , the spontaneous breaking of time translational symmetry (TTS)
becomes a focus of research and controversy3–9 . According to the special theory of relativity, time and space
must be put on the same footing. The existence of crystals is a manifestation of space translational symmetry
(STS) being spontaneously broken into a discrete one10 .
It is then natural to think that TTS can also be spontaneously broken into a discrete one.
It was soon noticed that the original definition of TTS
breaking by Wilczek is problematic. Bruno3 , and Watanabe and Oshikawa4 , proved that continuous TTS cannot
be broken in the ground state or Gibbs ensemble of a
quantum system. But this does not rule out the possibility of TTS breaking in nonequilibrium states. The
spontaneous breaking of TTS was redefined for periodically driven systems5 . The proposals for experiments
were discussed6,7 and realized in 20168,9 .
In the theory of special relativity, STS and TTS are
connected to each other by a rotation in spacetime,
i.e. the Lorentz transformation. Lagrangian must be
invariant under both the Lorentz transformations and
spacetime translations, which combine into the Poincaré
group11 . The low-energy states may have less symmetries. After a process called spontaneous symmetry
breaking, the symmetry group reduces to a subgroup of
the Poincaré group. Examples are the space groups of
crystals. It was long believed that crystals have discrete
STS, continuous TTS, but no Lorentz symmetry.
An exceptional possibility was discussed in Ref. [12]. In
1+1 dimensions, the Poincaré group has subgroups that
include both discrete spacetime translations and discrete
Lorentz transformations. A crystal cannot have continuous Lorentz symmetry, but it can have discrete one. As
thus, it must have discrete TTS as well. The overall
translational symmetry is determined by a lattice in 1+1
dimensions. And the period of TTS is connected to the
lattice constant of crystal and the speed of light. The
possibility of crystals owning discrete TTS and Lorentz
symmetry has not been noticed before. Indeed, no observation of such symmetry was reported up to now. A possible explanation is that the period of TTS is too small,

only in the order of 10−18 s.
In this paper, we generalize above results to higher
dimensions. We classify the discrete Poincaré groups
in 1+2 and 1+3 dimensions. They are the candidate
symmetry groups of the corresponding two- and threedimensional crystals, respectively. The STS of a crystal
is given by its Bravais lattice. There are 5 and 14 Bravais
lattices in two and three spatial dimensions, respectively.
We find discrete Poincaré symmetry only on six of them.
Table I enumerates these lattices and the discrete symmetry on them. Our results have potential application in the
search of exotic symmetry of crystals. Our finding might
also be interesting to ones who study quantum gravity.
Some approaches to quantum gravity propose the spacetime to have a lattice structure13–18 . And the study on
discrete Poincaré groups provides a way of maintaining
the Lorentz symmetry on a spacetime lattice.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the discrete Poincaré group in 1+1 dimensions, and
then introduce the method of generalization to higher
dimensions. Sec. III and IV contribute to 1+2 and 1+3
dimensions, respectively. Sec. V discusses the possible
way of observing discrete Poincaré symmetry in crystals.

DISCRETE POINCARÉ SYMMETRY

Crystals have discrete STS. Their local properties
change periodically in space. In 1+1 dimensions, a crystal looks the same under a spatial translation of coordinates if and only if the translation distance is an integer times of the lattice constant. Between two reference
frames that are moving relative to each other, the coordinates transform as a Lorentz transformation. Usually,
crystals look different in different reference frames. But
Ref. [12] showed that it is possible for crystals to look
the same if the relative velocity takes some specific values. The cost is that the properties of crystals must
change with time at some specific periods. This kind of
symmetry is called the discrete Poincaré symmetry.
Ref. [12] discussed in general how to construct a periodic function of spacetime that is invariant under a
group of Lorentz transformations. STS of a crystal is
determined by its Bravais lattice. The 1D Bravais lattice

group L contains the elements of R, as well as the Lorentz
boosts B~vj . The velocity ~vj in the Lorentz boost must be in
the direction of r1 , and can only take some discrete values (j
is an integer).

can be extended in the time direction to form a 1+1dimensional spacetime lattice. For simplicity, let us view
a crystal as a spacetime lattice. Under specific Lorentz
transformations, this lattice keeps the same in spite of
length contraction and time dilation. This is possible if
the spatial direction after transformation is still in one
of the lattice directions. The spatial directions vary from
one reference frame to the other, but the lattice constant,
i.e. the distance between two neighbor sites in the spatial
direction, keeps the same. Notice that two spatial neighbor sites in one reference frame are not spatial neighbors
in the other because they are not simultaneous any more.
All the coordinate transformations that keep a crystal
invariant make up a group, dubbed the discrete Poincaré
group. It contains the discrete Lorentz transformations
and the spacetime translation of lattice vectors. The element of a discrete Poincaré group is denoted by Λ(L, r),
which means a Lorentz transformation L followed by a
spacetime translation r. In 1+1 dimensions, L is a 2-by-2
matrix and r is a two-components vector. According to
definition, the product of two group elements reads
Λ(L′ , r′ )Λ(L, r) = Λ(L′ L, L′ r + r′ ).

component of a vector denotes the time coordinate, while
the second denotes the space coordinate.
A discrete Poincaré group is determined by its generator g (g ≥ 2). As g = 2, we have mj ≡ 2 and vj ≡ 0.
P contains no Lorentz transformation, and the translation vector rn0 n1 is purely spatial. This is the symmetry
group of 1D crystals in the orthodox view.
In the case g > 2, the spatial translations (n0 = 0)
in P keep the same. But P contains additional discrete
Lorentz transformations and discrete TTS. As g > 2 is
even, the points rn0 n1 form a rectangular lattice in 1+1dimensional spacetime. This lattice gives the spacetime
translational symmetry. Both TTS and STS are discrete,
which are connected to each other by the
p discrete Lorentz
rotations Lvj . The period of TTS is g 2 − 4a/(2c). As
rectangular
g is odd, the points rn0 n1 form a centered
p
lattice. The period of TTS becomes g 2 − 4a/c. The
velocity vj in the Lorentz rotation √
can only√take discrete
values. For√example,
v
takes
0,
5c/3, 3 5c/7, · · · at
j
√
g = 3, or 0, 3c/2, 4 3c/7, · · · at g = 4.
P is the subgroup of the continuous Poincaré group for
whatever g. It is reasonable to guess that P at g > 2 is
also the symmetry group of some crystals. If a crystal
chooses P at g > 2 as its symmetry group, it looks the
same after a coordinate translation only if the translation
vector is rn0 n1 . It means that the local properties are
varying not only with space but also with time. They
are periodic functions of spacetime coordinates.
A few more words are necessary for explaining the
physical meaning of vj . Let us view a crystal as a chain
of atoms with the distance between two neighbors being
a. The discrete TTS requires that the atoms are moving
periodically even in the rest frame (like a lattice vibration). If all the atoms are oscillating in the same phase,
a becomes the period in the spatial direction (the lattice
constant). But in a moving reference frame, the atoms
are not oscillating in the same phase anymore, because
simultaneity depends on the reference frame. Starting

3
from an atom A, we will find that the movement of its
neighbor is now behind A. But since the oscillation is
periodic, after a few atoms, we may again find an atom
B that is oscillating in the same phase as A. Now the
lattice constant becomes the distance between A and B.
But due to the length contraction, this distance is indeed
a in the moving reference frame. For this to happen, the
contraction must be strong, since the distance between A
and B in the rest frame is a few times of a. This explains
why vj is comparable to the speed of light.
Eq. (2) gives the discrete Poincaré groups in 1+1 dimensions. In this paper, we generalize to 1+2 and 1+3
dimensions. For this purpose, we define the symmorphic
Poincaré group. The element Λ(L, r) is a pure Lorentz
transformation as r = 0, or a pure translation as L = 1
(the identity matrix). We use L = {L} to denote a
group of Lorentz transformations, and Y = {r} to denote a group of translations. If the set P is a direct
product of L and Y and P is a group under the multiplication rule (1), we say that P is a symmorphic Poincaré
group. This definition is similar to the symmorphic space
group in crystallography. In 1+1 dimensions, the discrete
Poincaré group is indeed a symmorphic group.
In d ≥ 2 spatial dimensions, the Lorentz transformation L ∈ L is a (1+d)-by-(1+d) matrix. The translation
r ∈ Y is a (1 + d)-dimensional vector. L acting on r gives
the transformation of a vector between different reference
frames. If Lr and L−1 r are both the elements of Y for
each r ∈ Y, we say that Y is invariant under L. Note
that Y is indeed a lattice in (1 + d)-dimensional spacetime. Y being invariant under L means that this lattice
keeps the same after the spacetime rotation L. If Y is
invariant under each L ∈ L, we say that Y is invariant
under L. We construct discrete Poincaré groups based
on next fact: L × Y is a symmorphic Poincaré group if
and only if Y is invariant under L. The proof is given in
appendix A.
In d ≥ 2 spatial dimensions, symmetry operations include rotation, reflection, inversion and improper reflection. These operations are denoted by R. And we use
B to denote a Lorentz boost (a symmetric matrix in the
unit c = 1). In general, a Lorentz transformation in 1+d
dimensions can be expressed as L = RB. In d ≥ 2 spatial dimensions, the group L contains not only Lorentz
boosts, but also spatial rotations, reflections, etc.. Indeed, it is not enough to identify a reference frame by
just giving its velocity. Because different reference frames
may differ by a rotation. This complexity causes all
the difficulties in the construction of discrete Poincaré
groups.
In our approach, we start from a d-dimensional Bravais
lattice, extending it in the time direction to form a (1+d)dimensional lattice Y. Therefore, Y contains the Bravais
lattice as its part. This is what we require for P = L × Y
being the symmetry group of a Bravias lattice.
We then check if Y is invariant under the Lorentz
boosts, rotations, reflections, etc.. These operations
make up the group L. L contains the point group of

the Bravais lattice. For example, for the 2D square lattice, L must contain the spatial rotations of angles 0,
π/2, π or 3π/2. If L contains nothing more than the
point group, Y is obviously invariant under L (a Bravais lattice is invariant under its point group according
to definition). In this case, we obtain a trivial symmorphic Poincaré group with no Lorentz transformation. It
is the symmetry group of crystals in the orthodox view.
For P to be nontrivial, L must contain at least one
Lorentz boost B~v with ~v 6= 019 . We find that Y is invariant under B~v ∈ L only if ~v is in the lattice direction, that
is ~v connects at least two sites of the Bravais lattice (see
appendix B for the proof). Without loss of generality,
we suppose that ~v is in the x-direction. The sites of Y
in the x-axis then form a 1D Bravais lattice. Eq. (3) has
told us the unique way of extending a 1D Bravais lattice
into a (1+1)-dimensional spacetime lattice. In this way,
we naturally obtain the sublattice of Y in the t-x plane.
We can then obtain the whole Y and P = L × Y (see
the detailed derivation in appendix C and D). P is the
subgroup of the continuous Poincaré group, at the same
time contains the space group of Bravais lattice as its
subgroup. In next sections, we enumerate P in 1+2 and
1+3 dimensions.
III.

TWO DIMENSIONAL BRAVAIS LATTICES

In two spatial dimensions, there are five Bravais lattices: oblique, rectangular, centered rectangular, hexagonal and square lattices. There exist symmorphic Poincaré
groups on the rectangular lattice, but no symmorphic
Poincaré groups on the other four lattices (see table I).
The derivation is given in appendix C.
Recall that an element of the symmorphic Poincaré
group is denoted as Λ(L, r), where L is an element of L
and r is an element of Y. Here L is the group of Lorentz
transformations and Y is the group of translations. r is a
vector in 1+2-dimensional spacetime, and can be generally expressed as r = (t, x, y)T where t denotes the time
and x and y denote the space coordinates. Two primitive
vectors of the rectangular lattice are r1 = (0, a1 , 0)T and
r2 = (0, 0, a2 )T with a1 6= a2 .
The symmorphic Poincaré group is determined by an
integer generator g ≥ 2. All the Lorentz boosts in L must
be in the same direction. It is either in the x-direction
or in the y-direction. Without loss of generality, we suppose it to be in the x-direction.
p The temporal primitive
(e)
vector of Y is then r0 = ( g 2 − 4 a1 /(2c), 0, 0)T for
p
(o)
even g, or r0 = ( g 2 − 4 a1 /(2c), a1 /2, 0)T for odd g.
An arbitrary vector of Y can be expressed as
rn0 n1 n2 = n0 r0 + n1 r1 + n2 r2 ,

(4)

where n0 , n1 and n2 are integers. Fig. 1 shows a unit cell
of Y. Y in 1+2 dimensions is indeed an extension of the
1+1-dimensional spacetime lattice along a perpendicular
direction. Y is an orthorhombic lattice for even g or a
base-centered orthorhombic lattice for odd g.

We use R to denote the point group of a Bravais lattice.
For the rectangular lattice, R contains a rotation of angle
π in the x-y plane, a reflection across the x-axis and a
reflection across the y-axis. The discrete Lorentz group
L can then be expressed as

L = RBvj R ∈ R and j = 0, ±1, ±2, · · · .
The element of L is the product of a spatial operation and
a Lorentz boost. In the case g = 2, Bvj is the identity
matrix and L reduces to R, that is the Lorentz symmetry
is absent. For g > 2, L gives a discrete Lorentz symmetry
in the x-direction, but no Lorentz symmetry in the ydirection.

THREE DIMENSIONAL BRAVAIS
LATTICES

In three spatial dimensions, there are 14 Bravais lattices. There exists symmorphic Poincaré symmetry on
the monoclinic, orthorhombic, base-centered orthorhombic, tetragonal and hexagonal lattices (see table I). The
derivation is given in appendix D.
We denote a vector in 1+3-dimensional spacetime as
(t, x, y, z)T . Again, P = L × Y denotes the symmorphic
Poincaré group. The Lorentz boosts in L are supposed to
be in the x-direction without loss of generality. Similar

There is no Lorentz symmetry in the y-z plane.
Y in 1+3 dimensions has four primitive vectors.
We use r1 , r2 and r3 to denote the three primitive
vectors of the Bravais lattice.
If r1 is chosen to
be (0, a1 , 0, 0)T , the temporal primitive vector is then

can be expressed as
rn0 n1 n2 n3 = n0 r0 + n1 r1 + n2 r2 + n3 r3 ,

(8)

where n0 , n1 , n2 and n3 are integers.
Note that r1 cannot be chosen arbitrarily. It is required that r2 and r3 be both perpendicular to r1 . Fig. 2
displays the direction of r1 on different Bravais lattices.
The monoclinic, orthorhombic, base-centered orthorhombic, tetragonal and hexagonal lattices can be viewed as
the five 2D Bravais lattices extended in the perpendicular
direction, respectively. And this perpendicular direction
must be chosen to the direction of r1 . Especially, in the
tetragonal lattice, r1 must lie in the vertical direction in
which the lattice constant is different from those in the
other two directions.
Again, the discrete Poincaré group P is uniquely determined by the integer generator g ≥ 2. In the case g = 2,

5
we obtain Bvj ≡ 1 and L ≡ B. And r0 = 0 indicates
a continuous TTS. The symmetry group reduces to the
space group of Bravais lattices.
q
In the case g > 2, vj (g) = sign(j) 1 − 4/m2j c is
nonzero for j 6= 0. When one reference frame is moving
at vj relative to the other, the Bravais lattice looks the
same for them. And the temporal primitive vector is now
nonzero, indicating that TTS is broken into a discrete
one.
V.

DISCUSSION

We have enumerated the symmorphic Poincaré groups
on 2D and 3D Bravais lattices. An interesting question is
whether the symmorphic Poincaré symmetry does exist
in real crystals. According to our results, it is possible
to find such a symmetry only in crystals based on the
monoclinic, orthorhombic, base-centered orthorhombic,
tetragonal or hexagonal lattices. For examples, graphite
and rutile are based on the hexagonal and tetragonal
Bravais lattices, respectively.
If a crystal has symmorphic Poincaré symmetry, it
keeps invariant under a coordinate transformation of
P = L × Y, where L and Y are determined by the generator g. Each crystal has a unique g. To be more precise,
when we describe the motion of electrons (or phonons) in
this crystal, the Lagrangian density or equation of motion
need to keep invariant under P, which imposes a strong
constraint on the possible form of them. Here, the Lagrangian (or equation of motion) is an effective one, only
for the particles that we are interested in. The full Lagrangian for the electrons, nuclei and their interactions
has of course the continuous Poincaré symmetry. One
can think that the effective one is derived from the full
one by using some mean-field theory. Ref. [12] showed
how to construct such an effective Lagrangian from the
symmetry principle. One starts from a Lagrangian with
continuous Poincaré symmetry and then replaces the constants (coupling or mass) by a function f (r) that has the
symmetry P. Especially, f (r) is invariant under a translation of vector rn0 n1 n2 n3 , where rn0 n1 n2 n3 is given by
Eq. (8). As n0 = 0, this means that f (r) is a periodic
function of space. As n0 6= 0, we find that f (r) is also a
periodic function of time:
f (t, x, y, z) = f (t + T, x, y, z).
(9)
p
It is p
easy to see T =
g 2 − 4 a1 /(2c) for even g or
2
T = g − 4 a1 /c for odd g. Here a1 is the lattice constant. Since the coupling f in the equation of motion is
a periodic function, we expect the solutions to be also
periodic functions with the same period. Therefore, the
local properties of the crystal should change periodically
in the spacetime.
If the generator of a crystal is g = 2, we obtain T = 0.
In this case, f is independent of time, so are the local
properties. This is what we usually think of. But there

exist the other possibilities. If the generator of a crystal is g > 2, its local properties change periodically with
time, even in the absence of external driving. This is
the exclusive feature of symmorphic Poincaré symmetry.
An experiment searching for the time periodicity in crystals will then clarify whether there exists symmorphic
Poincaré symmetry or not. Let us take graphite as an
example. Its lattice constant
is a1 ≈ 6.7 × 10−10 m. Its
p
−18
2
time period
p is then T = g − 4 × 1.1 × 10 s for even
g or T = g 2 − 4 × 2.2 × 10−18s for odd g. The time periods of typical crystals are very small. This may explain
why the symmorphic Poincaré symmetry has not been
observed up to now. An alternative way of observing
the time periodicity would be by using the Floquet effect. The function f (r) in the equation of motion can be
treated as a periodically-driving potential. In the presence of it, we expect the system to absorb radiation of the
frequency 1/T . Therefore, a peak at this frequency in the
absorption spectrum would also support the existence of
discrete Poincaré symmetry. We use again graphite as an
−1/2
example. The frequency is g 2 − 4
× 9.1 × 1017 Hz

−1/2
for even g or g 2 − 4
× 4.5 × 1017 Hz for odd g. It is
in the frequency range of X-rays.
This paper focuses on the classification of discrete
Poincaré symmetry. In future, we expect to study the
effective field theories with this symmetry and how to
obtain them from a fundamental theory with continuous
Poincaré symmetry.

Appendix A: Proof of L × Y being a symmorphic
Poincaré group

Suppose L = {L} is a group of Lorentz transformations
and Y = {r} is a group of translations. We express the
set L × Y as P = {Λ(L, r)|L ∈ L, r ∈ Y}. According
to definition, P is a symmorphic Poincaré group if and
only if P is a group under the multiplication rule (1).
Therefore, our destination is to prove that P is a group
under the rule (1) if and only if Y is invariant under L.
First, we prove that P is a group if Y is invariant under L. The associativity of the multiplication rule (1)
is obvious. If Λ(L, r) and Λ(L′ , r′ ) are two elements of
P, we have L, L′ ∈ L and r, r′ ∈ Y according to definition. By using Eq. (1), we obtain Λ(L, r)Λ(L′ , r′ ) =
Λ(LL′ , Lr′ + r). Since L is a group, LL′ ∈ L is obvious. And because Y is invariant under L, we obtain

6
Lr′ ∈ Y and then Lr′ + r ∈ Y (Y is a group). Therefore,
Λ(LL′ , Lr′ + r) must be an element of P. The closure of
P is proved. Y and L are groups, so that they contain
identity elements. The identity element of Y is r = 0
(no translation), and the identity element of L is L = 1
(no Lorentz rotation). By using Eq. (1), it is easy to see
Λ(1, 0)Λ(L, r) = Λ(L, r)Λ(1, 0) = Λ(L, r) for arbitrary L
and r. Therefore, Λ(1, 0) is the identity element of P.
The existence of identity element is proved. If Λ(L, r) is
an element of P, we have L ∈ L and then L−1 ∈ L, and
r ∈ Y. Since Y is invariant under L, we obtain L−1 r ∈ Y
and then −L−1 r ∈ Y. Therefore, Λ(L−1 , −L−1 r) is also
an element of P according to definition. And it is easy
to see that Λ(L−1 , −L−1 r) is the inverse of Λ(L, r). The
existence of inverse element is proved. As above, if Y is
invariant under L, P must be a group.
Second, we prove that P is not a group if Y is not
invariant under L. If Y is not invariant under L, there
exist L ∈ L and r ∈ Y so that Lr 6∈ Y. Because L and Y
are groups and the set P is the direct product of L and Y,
we know that Λ(L, 0), Λ(1, r) and Λ(L−1 , 0) are the elements of P. Their product is Λ(L, 0)Λ(1, r)Λ(L−1 , 0) =
Λ(1, Lr). But Λ(1, Lr) is not an element of P. Therefore,
P is not closed under the rule (1). P is not a group.
As above, P is a group if and only if Y is invariant
under L.

Appendix B: Proof of ~v being in the lattice direction

Suppose Y is a spacetime lattice obtained by extending
a Bravais lattice in the time direction. B~v is a Lorentz
boost, and it is an element of L. In this appendix, we
prove that Y is invariant under L only if ~v is in the lattice
direction.
In 1 + d dimensions, we can express the spacetime coordinates as (t, x1 , · · · , xd )T . Without loss of generality,
we suppose that ~v is confined to the x1 -direction. The
matrix B~v then looks like


B~v is a symmetric matrix if we use the unit c = 1. The
diagonal elements are all 1 and the off-diagonal elements
are all zero except for the first two lines and columns.
Suppose r ∈ Y is a Bravais lattice vector, hence its temporal component is zero. We choose r = (0, x1 , · · · , xd )T
with x1 6= 0 without loss of generality. Indeed, there always exist lattice vectors with nonzero component in the
x1 -direction, otherwise, it is not a Bravais lattice.
If Y is invariant under B~v , B~v r must be an element of
Y. And B~v ∈ L infers B−~v ∈ L. Therefore, B−~v r is an
element of Y, hence r′ = B~v r + B−~v r − 2r is an element

of Y. Here we have used the properties of Y being a
T
group. r′ reads (0, kx1 , 0, · · · ) with k = √ 2 2 2 − 2.
1−v /c

We have k > 0 for v 6= 0, and then r′ 6= 0. According to
the definition of Y, r′ is a Bravais lattice vector since its
temporal component is zero. And r′ lies in the x1 -axis.
This means that the x1 -direction is a lattice direction.
We then proved that ~v is in the lattice direction.
Appendix C: (1+2)-dimensional symmorphic
Poincaré groups

In this section, we construct the symmorphic Poincaré
groups in 1+2 dimensions. We use (t, x, y)T to denote
the coordinates in 1+2 dimensions. Suppose P = L × Y
is a symmorphic Poincaré group. Y is invariant under
L. For nontrivial P, L contains at least one Lorentz
boost B~v . And Y is invariant under B~v . As proved in
appendix B, ~v must be in the lattice direction. Without
loss of generality, we suppose that ~v is in the x-direction
and the lattice constant in this direction is a1 . Therefore,
r1 = (0, a1 , 0)T is a primitive vector of the Bravais lattice,
and a primitive vector of Y as well.
B~v can be expressed as



which is a symmetric matrix in the unit c = 1. B~v rotates r1 into the t-x plane. The sublattice of Y in the
t-x plane is a (1+1)-dimensional spacetime lattice, which
is invariant under B~v . Obviously, this sublattice and B~v
are the elements of a (1+1)-dimensional discrete Poincaré
group. As reviewed in Sec. II, such a group is determined by an integer generator g ≥ 2. For an even g,
(e)
the
p primitive vectors of the sublattice are r1 and r0 =
( g 2 − 4 a1 /(2c), 0, 0)T . For an odd g, the primitive vecp
(o)
tors are r1 and r0 = ( g 2 − 4 a1 /(2c), a1 /2, 0)T . And
the velocity in the Lorentz boost can only take the values
q
(C2)
vj = sign(j) 1 − 4/m2j (g) c
with j = 0, ±1, ±2, · · · .
The lattice Y has three primitive vectors in 1+2 dimensions. Among them, r0 and r1 lie in the t-x plane.
While the Bravais lattice has two primitive vectors in the
spatial dimensions, namely r1 and r2 . Obviously, r0 , r1
and r2 must be the three primitive vectors of Y.
Without loss of generality, we express r2 as
(0, r2x , r2y )T . An arbitrary vector of Y (dubbed a lattice vector) can be expressed as n0 r0 + n1 r1 + n2 r2 with
n0 , n1 and n2 being integers. Y is invariant under B~v if
and only if B~v r0 , B~v r1 and B~v r2 are lattice vectors. B~v r0
and B~v r1 are obviously lattice vectors, since r0 and r1 are

7
the primitive vectors of the (1+1)-dimensional sublattice
which is invariant under B~v .
Let us study the condition of B~v r2 being a lattice vector. The value of ~v is given by Eq. (C2). And we already
j
know from Ref. [12] that B~vj = (B~v1 ) , where the superscript denotes the exponent. Therefore, B~vj r2 is a
lattice vector if and only if B~v1 r2 and B−~v1 r2 are lat−1
tice vectors. Note (B~v1 ) = B−~v1 . And the elementary
Lorentz boost is

B ′ = Rπ/2 B~v Rπ/2
is then a Lorentz boost in the ydirection. And (B~v B ′ B ′ B~v ) ∈ L is a Lorentz boost of
velocity ~v ′ . ~v ′ makes an angle 0 < θ < π/2 with the
positive x-axis. As proved in above, ~v ′ must be in a lattice direction of the square lattice, since Y is also invariant under (B~v B ′ B ′ B~v ). And if we use r1′ to denote the
primitive vector of the square lattice in the ~v ′ -direction,
the other primitive vector r2′ has to be perpendicular to
r1′ . But this is impossible on a square lattice. Therefore, a square lattice cannot have nontrivial symmorphic
Poincaré symmetry.
In two spatial dimensions, there exist nontrivial symmorphic Poincaré symmetry only on the rectangular lattice. If we choose two perpendicular primitive vectors r1 = (0, a1 , 0)T and r2 = (0, 0, a2 )T with a1 6= a2 , the
Lorentz boost must be in the direction of r1 or r2 .

Now we obtain two equations:
B~v1 r2 =n0 r0 + n1 r1 + n2 r2
B−~v1 r2 =n̄0 r0 + n̄1 r1 + n̄2 r2 .

Appendix D: (1+3)-dimensional symmorphic
Poincaré groups

(C4)

We need to find r2x and r2y so that n0 , n1 , n2 , n̄0 , n̄1 ,
n̄2 are all integers. It is easy to see that r2x must be an
integer times of a1 but r2y can be arbitrary real number.
Without loss of generality, we choose r2x = 0 and rename
r2y as a2 . The second primitive vector of the Bravais
lattice is then r2 = (0, 0, a2 )T .
In one word, if P = L × Y is a symmorphic Poincaré
group and L contains at least one Lorentz boost, two
primitive vectors of the Bravais lattice must be perpendicular to each other and the velocity of the boost is in
the direction of one primitive vector.
With this in mind, we rule out the possibility of
oblique, centered rectangular or hexagonal lattices owning nontrivial symmorphic Poincaré symmetry. Further
analysis rules out the possibility of the square lattice.
This can be proved by contradiction. We suppose that
a square lattice has the primitive vectors r1 = (0, a, 0)T
and r2 = (0, 0, a)T . Its spacetime lattice Y is invariant under the Lorentz boost B~v with ~v lying in the xdirection. B~v is an element of L. Do not forget that L
contains the point group of the square lattice. In particular, a rotation of angle π/2 in the x-y plane is an element
of L, which can be expressed as

In this section, we construct the symmorphic Poincaré
groups in 1+3 dimensions. We use (t, x, y, z)T to denote
the coordinates in 1+3 dimensions. Again, we suppose
P = L × Y is a symmorphic Poincaré group. And L
contains at least one Lorentz boost B~v . ~v is in the xdirection and the lattice constant in this direction is a1 .
r1 = (0, a1 , 0, 0)T is a primitive vector of the Bravais
lattice. The other two primitive vectors are supposed to
be r2 = (0, r2x , r2y , r2z )T and r3 = (0, r3x , r3y , r3z )T .
Similarly, we can prove that r2x = 0 and r3x = 0. r2
and r3 must be perpendicular p
to r1 . And the temporal
(e)
primitive vector of Y is r0 = ( g 2 − 4 a1 /(2c), 0, 0, 0)T
p
(o)
for even g or r0 = ( g 2 − 4 a1 /(2c), a1 /2, 0, 0)T for odd
g.
In three-dimensional Bravais lattices, the boost must
be in the direction of one primitive vector and the other
two primitive vectors are in the perpendicular direction.
There are 14 Bravais lattices. Only in the monoclinic,
orthorhombic, base-centered orthorhombic, tetragonal,
hexagonal or cubic lattices, there exist two primitive vectors that are both perpendicular to the third one. But
similar to the square lattice in two dimensions, the cubic lattice cannot have nontrivial symmorphic Poincaré
symmetry.
Notice that the monoclinic, orthorhombic, basecentered orthorhombic, tetragonal and hexagonal lattices
can be created by extending five 2D Bravais lattices in
the perpendicular direction. And this direction is indeed
the direction of the Lorentz boost.
