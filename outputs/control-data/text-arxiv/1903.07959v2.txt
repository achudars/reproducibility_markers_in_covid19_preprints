Abstract. In the laser — electron beam head-on interaction electron energy can
decrease due to radiation reaction, i.e. emission of photons. For 10–100 fs laser
pulses and for the laser field strength up to the pair photoproduction threshold,
it is shown that one can calculate the resulting electron and photon spectra as
if the electron beam travels through a constant magnetic field. The strength of
this constant field and the interaction time are found as functions of the laser
field amplitude and duration. Using of constant field approximation can make a
theoretical analysis of stochasticity of the radiation reaction much more simple
in comparison with the case of alternating laser field, also, it allows one to get
electron and photon spectra much cheaper numerically than by particle-in-cell
simulations.

Global constant field approximation for radiation reaction in collision of high-intensity laser pulse with electron beam2
1. Introduction
The collision of light from optical and free-electron
lasers with ultrarelativistic electron beams is being
used routinely nowadays to produce MeV photons via
Compton scattering on facilities such as HIγS [1, 2]
and NewSUBARU [3, 4]. This method is also a central
point of ELI-NP facility [5, 6] which is planned to
become operational as user facility in 2019 [7].
The theory of scattering of light by relativistic
electrons is well known, however, in some interaction
regimes only a few experiments are carried out, e.g. in
nonlinear and quantum regimes. At high intensity of
the laser radiation an electron absorbs a big number
of optical photons in order to produce a single hard
photon — the scattering becomes nonlinear [8, 9]. At
even higher intensities of laser radiation the photon
recoil occurs, and the photon emission obeys quantum
synchrotron formulas [10, 11], testing of which is a
long-standing experimental challenge [12, 13, 14, 15].
The interest to such studies was fueled recently by
study [16] of quantum radiation reaction in aligned
crystals that demonstrates a discrepancy between
experimental data and results obtained with the
quantum synchrotron formula. Thus, a discussion of
theoretical models of radiation reaction reopens [17,
18].
In the context of intense laser pulses with a0  1,
the photon emission by relativistic electrons and the
corresponding modification of the electron spectrum
(i.e. radiation reaction) is generally treated by particlein-cell (PIC) simulations with Monte Carlo (MC)
technique incorporated [11, 19, 20, 21, 22] (here a0 =
eE0 /mcωL with E0 the electric field amplitude, e > 0
the elementary charge, m electron mass and c the speed
of light). PIC-MC simulations solves implicitly the
Boltzmann’s equations (BEs) for particle distribution
functions [11, 23] which can be solved directly in
numerical simulations as well [24].
It is shown in Ref. [24] that if the electron
energy remains high enough during the collision, the
electrons trajectories are bended negligibly and can
be considered straight.
For the sake of further
simplification one can assume that the transverse size
of the electron beam is smaller than the laser spot size,
and also neglect the collective (plasma) effects in the
electron beam. In this case the radiation reaction is
described within one-dimensional (1D) BE:
Z ∞
∂t fe = −U fe +
fe (0 )w(0 → ) d0 ,
(1)


where, unless otherwise specified, all quantities are
given at (t, ), also, w(0 → ) d dt is the probability
for an electron with energy 0 in a time interval dt to
emit a photon such that the resulting electron energy is
in the interval (,  + d), with d and dt infinitesimals.

Note that it is possible to describe the evolution of
the electron distribution with (1) because the emission
probability w is determined by the local field value [10]
and no interference of the emitted photons occurs.
Here U is the full emission probability rate
Z 
w( → 0 ) d0 .
(2)
U () =
0

The photon distribution function fph do not take
part in (1) in the classical radiation reaction limit, i.e.
until the quantum parameter
χ = b

(3)

is small, χ . 1, hence no pair photoproduction
occurs [11]. Here b = F/eES is the ratio of the
Lorentz force transverse to the electron velocity [F ≈
|FL × v/c| with FL = e(E + v × B/c)] to the force
in the Sauter–Schwinger field ES = m2 c3 /eh̄ with
v the electron velocity, E and B the electric and
magnetic fields, respectively, h̄ = h/2π and h the
Planck’s constant. From here on the electron energy 
is normalized to the electron rest energy mc2 .
The photon emission probability depend on the
laser field, which varies with time along the electron
trajectory, and the general solution of (1) reads as
Z t

fe (t) = T exp
Â(t0 ) dt0 fe (0),
(4)
0

where the linear operator Â represents the right hand
side of (1) (multiplication by U and convolution with
w), and T exp is the time-ordered exponential known,
for example, from the quantum field theory [10]. It
can be considered as a Taylor series of the exponential
function, with ordered products of Â(t1 )Â(t2 ) such
that t2 > t1 . The time-ordered exponential can be
found numerically [24], whereas its theoretical analysis
in the general case faces the difficulties similar to that
in Lie theory (see, for instance, Campbell–Hausdorff
formula [25]).
If the laser pulse is not single-cycled, the rising and
descent slopes of a half-wave have the same shape and
they yield in (4) sum of products of the same operators
in the opposite order, Â(t1 )Â(t2 ) + Â(t3 )Â(t4 ) with
Â(t3 ) = Â(t2 ) and Â(t4 ) = Â(t1 ). Thus, one
can assume that the commutator of Â(t1 ) and Â(t2 )
is averaged away for any t1 and t2 . In this case
T exp is the ordinary exponential and the integration
in (4) can be considered as a sort of averaging (that
is especially clear for the matrix representation, see
below). Therefore, in this case the general solution of
BEs (with alternating field) given at t is equivalent to
the solution of BEs with some new functions U ∗ and
w∗ which do not depend on time on the interval [0, t].
One can try to use w and U for some
global constant magnetic field and some interaction
time instead of the averaged probabilities of the

Global constant field approximation for radiation reaction in collision of high-intensity laser pulse with electron beam3
emission in the laser field w∗ and U ∗ .
The
correspondence between the alternating laser field and
the constant magnetic field which result the same
electron distribution function (from here on global
constant field approximation, GCFA) can be justified
rigorously in the Fokker–Planck (FP) regime of the
radiation reaction. Indeed, in the FP regime [22, 26],
when the energy of individual photons is small and
the number of the emitted photons per electron is
large, the resulting electron spectrum do not depend
on the exact shape of w(0 → ), and depend only
on the first and second momenta of w. Thus, one
can easily find the parameters of GCFA (the value
of the constant field, and the interaction time) which
lead to the same distribution function fe (t) as for the
laser field, as shown in Section 2. Then in Section 3
the matrix representation of BEs and the numerical
method to solve them for a constant magnetic field, are
considered. In Section 4 GCFA is tested in FP regime
as well as in the regime of low number of the emitted
photons and in the quantum regime χ ∼ 1. Moreover,
here we compare the photon spectrum obtained in the
laser field with that in the constant magnetic field.
2. GCFA in Fokker–Planck regime of radiation
reaction
It is shown by Baier and Katkov [27, 28, 10] that the
photon emission in the quantum synchrotron regime in
almost arbitrary field is described by the same formulae
as for a pure magnetic field,

with α = e2 /h̄c ≈ 1/137 the fine-structure constant.
If the quantum parameter χ  1 (so-called classical
limit), it is seen from (5) that the emission spectra is
determined by the critical frequency ωc ,
h̄ωc
= χ,
(8)
mc2
namely, the width of the emission spectra and the
mean energy of the emitted photons is of the order
of h̄ωc [29]. Furthermore, the full emission probability
is U ∼ α/trf with
trf ∼ mc/F

(9)

is the radiation formation time. Thus, in the average
an electron emits a single photon in a time of about
137 trf . Note that in the classical limit h̄ωc  mc2 .
One can turn from the differential equation (1) to
the consideration of the photon emission as a stochastic

process [30]. The electron energy decreases every time
when the electron emits a photon. Thus, the final
electron energy is its initial energy minus the energies
of the photons that the electron have emitted. In
the FP regime, as long as the number of the emitted
photons is large and the photon energy is much smaller
than the electron energy, the different events of the
photon emission can be considered independently, and
the central limit theorem can be applied. Hence the
mean drop of the electron energy and the electron
energy variance (µ and σ 2 , respectively) are the sums of
these quantities for individual photon emission events.
The critical frequency is proportional to F , hence for
the emission of a single photon its mean energy µi ∝ F
and the energy variance is σi2 ∝ F . Recalling that the
full emission probability U ∝ ωc ∝ F , and replacing
the sum in the central limit theorem with the integral,
one get
Z t
µ∝
F 2 (t0 ) dt0 ,
(10)
0
Z t
σ2 ∝
F 3 (t0 ) dt0 .
(11)
0

Equations (10) and (11) allow one readily find the
correspondence between the constant magnetic field
and the laser field such that µ and σ are the same
in both cases. Note that in the above-mentioned
considerations we implicitly suppose a fixed number
of the emitted photons in the central limit theorem.
To compute GCFA parameters definitely, one can
consider two setups. The first is a passing of an electron
through the magnetic field H0 such that F = eH0
during the time interval τ . The second is the head
on collision of an electron with a finite plane wave in
that the electric field is



cos(kL ξ),
(12)
E = E0 cos2

and the magnetic field is H = E, with ξ = x − ct,
kL = ωL /c, ωL the circular frequency and xL the
FWHM of the electric field. If the initial electron
position is x(0) = xL , then the full passing of the
electron through the pulse corresponds to t ∈ [0, xL /c]
and

3. Numerical integration of Boltzmann’s
equations in constant magnetic field
For numerical solution of BE in a constant magnetic
field the code Scintillans is presented [31] which
is available under the BSD3 licence. The code is
written in Haskell language and is based on the repa
library [32] that results a C-comparable performance.
However, the Scintillans is written to be not the
most performant but simple and straightforward first.
The version 0.3.0 used here solves BEs which includes
electrons and photons [11, 24],

.

The singular behavior of w( → 0 ) (it tends to
infinity if 0 tends to ) is not important here because
the evolution of fe is determined rather by the emission
power distribution ( − 0 ) w( → 0 ) which is not
singular. Thus, in the numerical approximation it is
enough to resolve scales about some fraction of the
critical frequency (in the classical limit) or about some
fraction of  (in the quantum limit). For the same
reason we use wk→k = 0.
Equations (16) and (17) now can be solved with
Euler’s method
f (t) = exp(Ât)f (0),

where fe and fph are the column vectors representing
the electron and photon distribution functions on the
energy intervals [a , b ] and [0, b − a ]:

is such small that the photon emission is negligible for
electrons with a , or there is almost no electrons with
energy about a . Then, the matrix Û is the diagonal
matrix with the diagonal elements computed as sums
within the corresponding columns of Ŵ . To compute
Â10 we permute the elements in the columns of Ŵ :

1). Using different but consistent energy intervals
for the electron and photon distribution functions is
especially useful in the classical regime where one can
choose b − a  b .
The elements of the block matrix Â are the
matrices Â00 = −Û + Ŵ , Â01 = Â11 = 0̂ (zero matrix)
and Â10 . The matrices Û , Ŵ and Â10 are defined as
follows. First,

where wk→l = w(a + k∆ → a + l∆). Note that
the transitions with negative indices (e.g. w0→−1 ) are
not taken into account. Thus, it is assumed that a

(25)
p

exp(Ât) ≈ (1̂ + Â∆t) ,

(26)

with p = [t/∆t] and 1̂ the identity matrix.
The exponentiation in (26) can be performed
with exponentiation-by-squaring algorithm which has
O(log p) complexity. Hence, the numerical solution of
BEs in GCFA is much faster than the computation of
BE solution for a variable field [with comlexity O(p)].
It is also obvious that the solution of 1D BEs in GCFA
is much faster than PIC computations.
Finally, (25) and (26), as the original BEs (16)
and (17), conserve the number of the electrons and
the overall energy. Namely, the multiplication of
(1̂ + Â00 ∆t) and fe do not modify the number of the
electrons,

Therefore, despite of its simplicity, Scintillans provides
fast and robust numerical solver of BEs for the
electrons and photons in a constant magnetic field.
4. GCFA in Fokker–Planck regime and
beyond: comparison with PIC simulations
To test GCFA, three dimensional (3D) simulations of
the electron beam collision with the laser pulse are
performed with PIC code quill [33]. The code quill

takes into account photon emission by the Monte Carlo
approach similar to rejection sampling [11, 34]. In the
simulations the laser pulse longitudinal shape is given
by (12), and additional transverse envelope introduced
which FWHM along the y and z axes are ys and zs ,
respectively. The duration xL /c and the amplitude
of the laser pulse, as well as the initial electron
energy 0 , are varied to obtain different regimes of
the radiation reaction. The interaction time allows
complete propagation of all the electrons through the
laser pulse. The full electron beam radius (2λL ) is
much smaller than the laser pulse transverse size (ys =
zs = 13.4λL ), where λL = 2πc/ωL = 1 µm is the laser
wavelength.
The results of PIC simulations for unnormalized
initial electron energy ε0 = 920 MeV ( = 1800) and
a0 = 16.5 are shown in figure 1 with light lines. The
maximal quantum parameter reached in this case is
χ ≈ 0.07. For xL = 82λL  137ctrf (xL /c = 270 fs,
137trf ≈ 4.4 fs) FP regime is attained. Accordingly
to the central limit theorem, in this case the electron
spectrum is close to the Gaussian one [noisy blue line
1 in figure 1(a)]. The corresponding photon energy
spectrum fph () is shown as a light blue line in
figure 1(b). Similarly, the electron spectra for 4 and
16 times shorter laser pulses (xL /c = 68 and 17 fs,
respectively) are shown as light blue lines 2 and 3
in figure 1(a), and the corresponding photon energy
spectra are shown in figures 1(c) and (d). Note that for
the short laser pulse every electron emits a few photons
in the average that makes FP approach [22] and the
central limit theorem inapplicable.
The results obtained with Scintillans in GCFA
are shown in figure 1 as black lines. Equations (14)
and (15) are used to obtain the strength of the
constant magnetic field and the interaction time from
the parameters of the laser pulses. Thus, black lines 1,
2 and 3 in figure 1(a) are the electron spectra, and
in figures 1(b), (c) and (d) are the photon energy
distribution fph () for H0 = 250 kT and τ = 102,
26 and 6.4 fs, respectively. These parameters yield
H0 /ES = 5.6 × 10−5 , the initial value of χ = 0.1 and
the photon emission time 137trf = 3.1 fs.
In Scintillans simulations, as well as in PIC
simulation, the electron distribution function is
normalised in the same way

fe () d = 1.

Note that the parameters of the Scintillans simulation
for dark curve 1 in figure 1(a) are the same as for
middle curves in figure 10(c) from Ref. [22], except
here initially monoenergetic electron beam with zero
temperature is used.
Nevertheless, the curve in
figure 1(a) is quite close to the corresponding curves
from Ref. [22] indicating the consistency between

emission by secondary electrons and positrons also
can spoil BEs. Therefore in the simulations described
below xL /c = 17 fs and ε = 2.76 GeV ( = 5400) are
used. The laser pulse amplitude varies to get different
values of χ.
In figure 2 the results of PIC simulations are shown
with light blue lines, and the solution of BEs in GCFA
obtained with Scintillans are shown with black lines.
Figures of the left column demonstrate the electron

photon energy spectrum fph (). Figures 2 (a, b),
(c, d) and (e, f) correspond to a0 = 16.5, 33 and 66,
respectively. In GCFA this yields the initial quantum
parameter χ0 = 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2. With the increase of
the magnetic field strength the photon emission time
decreases (137trf = 3.1, 1.6 and 0.8 fs while τ = 6.4 fs),
the number of photons emitted per electron increases,
and the electron distribution tends to lower energies.

Scintillans and smilei simulations.
For the longest laser pulse an additional PIC
simulation is performed in which the laser field
is defined analytically in the form (12), with no
transverse envelope hence no diffraction. The resulting
electron spectrum [orange stepped line 1 in figure 1(a)]
is close to that obtained in GCFA, thus the discrepancy
between blue and black lines 1 in figure 1(a) is caused
by the diffraction. Therefore, it can be concluded from
figure 1 that the electron and photon spectra can be
described well in GCFA in the classical limit if 1D BE
is applicable, even if the number of the emitted photons
is small.
Fairly good coincidence between the electron and
photon spectra computed in the constant magnetic
field and in the laser field forces to test GCFA in
the regime of moderate χ values, χ ∼ 1. For this,
one should use quite short laser pulses, xL . 137trf ,
otherwise the electrons loose almost all initial energy
making 1D BE inapplicable. Note that at χ & 1
pair photoproduction (which is not taken into account
in Scintillans simulations) and subsequent photon

and the total energy of gamma photons can characterize the interaction [14, 15]. These quantities are
coupled due to energy conservation, and in order to
characterize the resulting electron and photon beams
one can use instead, for instance, hεi, the mean electron energy, and nγ , the number of photons with energy higher than 100 MeV, normalized to the number
of electrons, which are given in table 1 for all the simulation results depicted in figures 1 and 2. In the table
PIC-MC simulation results are noted as ”PIC” and the
Scintillans’s results as ”Sc”. The first line of the table includes the results of PIC simulation with laser
pulse diffraction incorporated (light blue noisy line 1
in figure 1(a)).
Note that for the parameters of figures 2(a)(f) almost all assumptions are violated in which
equations (14) and (15) are derived. Namely, the
emission spectrum is not determined by the classical
synchrotron formula and by the critical frequency ωc ,
e.g. already at χ ≈ 0.2 the emission power is only
1/2 of that computed with the classical formula [10].
Also, the central limit theorem is not valid because
the number of the emitted photons is small and the
subsequent photon emission events are dependent (the
photon energy is of the order of the electron energy).
Therefore, a fairly good coincidence between solutions
of BEs in GCFA and results of PIC simulations with
alternating laser field implies that more reliable basis
for the correspondence (14)-(15) can be found.

Scintillans simulations takes time of seconds opposite
to PIC simulations that takes at least minutes, hence
a search of optimal experimental parameters [37] can
be easier in GCFA. Furthermore, in the experiments
with electron spectrum known before and after the
collision [15], one can find the laser pulse amplitude and
duration from a comparison of the experimental results
with results of Scintillans simulations in a large region
of parameters. Such comparison probably will allow
to evade experimental uncertainties and to distinguish
clearly different radiation reaction models.

5. Conclusion
Acknowledgments
In this paper we start from the Fokker–Planck (FP)
regime of the photon emission when the number of
the photons emitted per electron is large and the
energy of individual photons is small. For this case
two setups are considered: the photon emission by
electrons in a constant magnetic field, and the photon
emission by electrons in the head-on collision with a
laser pulse. The resulting electron spectra are the
same in both setups if the setup parameters relate
according to (14) and (15). Thus, in FP regime one
can compute the electron spectrum in a global constant
field approximation (GCFA) instead using alternating
laser field. Note that GCFA can be justified also in the
supercritical regime χ  1 [35].
PIC simulations demonstrate that the established
correspondence (14)-(15) can be used far beyond the
FP regime, namely, electron spectrum computed in
GCFA fits well the spectrum computed in the laser
field for χ ≈ 1 (hence the photon energy is comparable
with the electron energy) or for small numbers of the
emitted photons. Moreover, the spectra of the emitted
photons in the constant magnetic field and in the laser
field coincides fairly well with each other in these cases.
In GCFA the electron and photon spectra
can be efficiently computed from 1D Boltzmann’s
equations, for what the Scintillans open source code is
developed [31]. The code conserves exactly the number
of electrons and the total particle energy. Obviously,
in 1D Boltzmann’s equations neither pulse diffraction
nor collective effects in the electron beam [15] are
taken into account. However, the mentioned effects
are generally small and can be neglected for typical
parameters of laser pulse — electron beam interactions.
Theoretical analysis of radiation reaction in laser
fields, e.g. analysis of the stochasticity effect, is a
quite complicated task and often requires numerical
simulations [36, 22, 26, 21]. Radiation reaction in a
constant magnetic field looks much more simple than
in the alternating field, thus GCFA opens perspectives
of fully theoretical advance of the topic.
In the context of recent experimental study of
radiation reaction [14, 15], GCFA can be useful as well.
