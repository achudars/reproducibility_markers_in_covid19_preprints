Abstract
In the marine environment biological processes are strongly affected by oceanic
currents, particularly by eddies (vortices) formed by the hydrodynamic flow field.
Employing a kinematic flow field coupled to a population dynamical model for
plankton growth, we study the impact of an intermittent upwelling of nutrients
on triggering harmful algal blooms (HABs). Though it is widely believed that
additional nutrients boost the formation of HABs or algal blooms in general, we
show that the response of the plankton to nutrient plumes depends crucially on the
mesoscale hydrodynamic flow structure. In general, nutrients can either be quickly
washed out from the observation area, or can be captured by the vortices in the
flow. The occurrence of either scenario depends on the relation between the time
scales of the vortex formation and nutrient upwelling as well as the time instants
at which upwelling pulse occurs and how long do they last. We show that these
two scenarios result in very different responses in plankton dynamics which makes
it very difficult to predict, whether nutrient upwelling will lead to a HAB or not.
This explains, why observational data are sometimes inconclusive establishing a
correlation between upwelling events and plankton blooms.

Keywords: upwelling, eddies, harmful algal blooms.

Introduction

Coastal regions susceptible to harmful algal bloom (HAB) events are often subjected to
upwelling [1]. Due to this upwelling nutrient-rich deep waters are transported into the
euphotic zone and this inflow fosters favorable conditions for the growth of algae [2]. As
recent studies notice a significant increase of the number of harmful algal bloom events
in the whole world [3, 4, 5], it becomes imperative to understand the interplay between
the biotic and physical factors that work as their trigger.
Lateral mixing and stirring by the hydrodynamic flow redistributes the nutrients and
the suspended microorganisms, shaping the spatial heterogeneity of the marine ecosystem
at different scales [6], leading to plankton blooms, which exhibit a non-uniform distribution in space, referred to as “patchines”. This non-uniformity was ubiquitously detected
around the globe by satellite imagery [7, 8, 9, 10] and by samples along ship transects
[11, 12, 13]. In a seminal work by Abraham [14], a very simple model of turbulent transport was able to reproduce this spatial heterogeneity in the plankton distribution and its
statistical properties, such as spectra. This model shows that advection by ocean flows
on the mesoscale (10 - 100 km) can spatially distort the concentration of plankton leading
to the development of small spatial patterns and thin filaments. Subsequent theoretical
1

studies have observed that the ratio between biological and hydrodynamic flow time scales
has a non-trivial impact on how plankton is distributed spatially [15, 16]. The flow field
influences not only the spatial distribution but also the abundance of plankton. Further
studies have shown that it is possible to trigger or suppress HABs by tuning the flow to
the biological timescales [17, 18]. Therefore the hydrodynamics plays a central role for
phytoplankton ecosystems, not only with respect to its spatial patterns but also to the
inter-specific interactions, establishing so called “fluid dynamical niches”, which provide
particular growth conditions for certain species [19, 20]. Coherent structures of the flow
field, such as, for instance eddies play an important role influencing the biological processes in the ocean. The recent advances in detecting and tracking eddies in the ocean
have shown that they often are long lived. Notably they can trap fluid and the whole
community of plankton and bacteria inside, which affects the diversity and dominance
structure of phytoplankton species observed in the system [21, 20]. On the one hand,
the species in the almost isolated ecosystem inside the eddy are subjected to competitive
pressure. On the other hand, theoretical models speculate that due to this trapping the
organisms can also be sheltered inside the eddy from predators or competitors, a mechanism proposed as a possible explanation for the coexistence of species [22, 23, 24, 25].
Both effects are a direct result of transport barriers established by the flow field.
The productivity enhancing effect of coastal upwelling is also shown to be strongly
affected by the presence of coherent structures in the flow field [26, 27, 28]. The eddies mix
and disperse nutrients, while also taking them away from the coastal region. This leads to
a decrease in the primary production near the shore, as was recorded for eastern boundary
upwelling systems [28]. Furthermore, these nutrients while being transported offshore by
the eddies may also trigger the growth of the associated phytoplankton. Theoretical
works have shown that eddies in this case work as incubators for growth by sustaining
favorable environmental conditions. These models emphasize the importance of the role
of biological and hydrodynamic timescales in triggering plankton blooms and specifically
HABs in this scenario [29, 30, 31, 32]. However, these studies, have so far only analysed
the conditions of an upwelling which is constant in time. Nevertheless, upwelling itself
is not a steady process since it depends on winds and seasonality, being therefore highly
intermittent. Furthermore, from observations of HABs in nature, it is not always possible
to correlate the strength and the duration of an upwelling event and the occurrence and
magnitude of HABs. While it was possible to establish such a direct relation for some
species (e.g. diatoms of genus Pseudo-nitzschia [33, 34] and some dinoflagelates [35]), for
others a more complex chain of events appears to be driving the outcome [36]. Moreover,
the major challenge consists in finding out how the occurrences of HABs and the episodic
upwelling events are associated on a local scale [36, 37].
In this work we analyse the impact of intermittent upwelling events on phytoplankton
growth and changes in dominance patterns in the presence of mesoscale hydrodynamic
structures for a biological system with three trophic levels. We modify the reactionadvection-diffusion model introduced by Sandulescu et al. (2006) for the area around
the Canary islands [29], that couples advection by a vortex street behind an island with
a model of plankton dynamics. As in [29] we also choose to ignore the possibility of
eddy-induced Ekman pumping, a well known phenomenon where circulating ocean currents bring nutrients upwards or downwards within the eddies [38, 39]. In this way we
can isolate the plankton’s response to a single upwelling region, and study the effects
of upwelling intermittency. Furthermore it allows us to simplify to horizontal advection
only. In contrast to [29], we analyse here a community that consists of two phytoplankton species competing for a limiting resource and grazed by zooplankton. The population
model [40] chosen displays excitability, which arises from the interplay of the fast dynamic
timescale of phytoplankton growth (activator) with a slow development of zooplankton
(the inhibitor). We chose two scenarios with different plankton communities: (I) where
2

the community structure is shaped only by the availability of nutrients in the environment; (II) where both, the grazing pressure and the nutrient availability, trigger the bloom
formation. First we show that these two systems exhibit very different spatio-temporal
dominance patterns and display distinct and characteristic dynamical reactions to an upwelling event. Then we show that for both parameterizations even identical pulses of
nutrient influx, trigger a diverse set of reactions in the plankton dynamics. The variety of possible responses can only be understood by analysing the interplay of different
time scales that characterise the system as well as the interplay between the upwelling
and mesoscale hydrodynamic structures present in the flow. The outcome is even more
complex for the case of irregular pulses with a variety of strengths and durations. Our
analysis shows that it is impossible to establish a relation between the HABs formation and upwelling events, by only looking at the respective time series of nutrients and
plankton abundances without considering the mesoscale mixing by the ocean flow in the
observation region.
The work is organised as follows: First, in Sec. 2 we briefly introduce the coupled
hydrodynamic-biological model used. In Sec. 3.1, we examine how the position and initial
time of nutrient parcels initialized at the upwelling region affect the residence time of
nutrients in the observed area. In Sec. 3.2 we describe the spatio-temporal patterns of
plankton for the scenario without upwelling and for the scenario subjected to a single
upwelling pulse. Next, in Sec. 3.3 we describe how the response of the populations varies
considering different initial times for an upwelling pulse. Furthermore, we analyse the
chance of HAB formation for upwelling pulses of different duration and strengths. In
Sec. 3.5 we extend our analysis to the study of the response to a series of irregular
(intermittent) upwelling events. We conclude in Sec. 4.

Model

This section describes the modeling framework used in this work. The model consists of
a two dimensional kinematic velocity field coupled to a biological model, see Fig. 1.

2.1

Hydrodynamic model

The hydrodynamic model is represented by a two dimensional kinematic velocity field
(ux , uy ) that flows trough a predefined observation region passing by a circular obstacle
3

(of radius r), located at (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0), mimicking an island. The flow velocity is such
that it allows for the formation of vortices in the wake of the island. These vortices are
released and carried away from the island along the observation region, from left to right
in Fig.1 (a). Although this flow field can be obtained as a solution of the Navier-Stokes
equation, we use an analytically generated field [41] that captures the main characteristics
of this solution, but with smaller numerical efforts. The flow is characterized by a period
,
T and in this approach a predefined stream function Φ is used to generate it: ux = ∂Φ
∂y
∂Φ
uy = − ∂x . This flow is known as an open chaotic flow in literature, for a detailed
description of the modeling approach and the stream function see [41, 29]. The model
has been parameterized to represent one of the islands of the Canarian Archipelago,
located in the Eastern Boundary Upwelling System off the African Coast, in agreement
with [29], for details see Supplemental material.

2.2

Biological model

The biological model used, consists of a food web with three trophic levels NPPZ (Nutrients, two Phytoplankton species and Zooplankton) formulated in [40] to describe the
formation of harmful algal blooms (HABs). One of the phytoplankton species is considered to be toxic and the other one non-toxic, their concentrations are PT and PN ,
respectively. They compete for a limiting nutrient resource, N , while being grazed by
zooplankton, Z (see Fig. 1 (b)). The inter- and intraspecific interactions are described
by:

The functional responses and parameterization are listed in the Supplemental material.
As we will show below the system’s response to nutrient influx from upwelling results
from a combination of bottom-up and top-down controls. To be able to analyse how
these controls drive HAB formation we chose two different parameterizations for the
population model: system (I), where the community structure and the dominant species
results mainly from the availability of nutrients in the environment; system (II), where the
grazing preference of zooplankton together with the nutrient availability both establish
the resulting community structure. The parameters chosen for the two systems are very
similar, with a few differences which emphasize different ecological processes. In system
(I) the nutrient conversion rate θi and the respiration rates ri are different for each species
(θN < θT , rN > rT ), so that the net growth rate of PT is always larger than the one of
PN (see Fig. 2(a)). On the contrary, in system (II) these parameters are set to the same
values (θN = θT , rN = rT ), for both species. Consequently, in system (II) the abundance
of nutrients cannot drive a dominance change (see Fig. 2(b)). To especially test the
role of grazing, we modify the parametrisation of zooplankton in the second system, in
order to have a stronger influence of the grazer within the food chain. To that end, we
boost the abundance of zooplankton by increasing its maximum grazing rate λ and its
growth efficiency on the non-toxic species αN . Finally we also add in this set up a strong
preference of zooplankton to feed on non-toxic species (φ = 0.05), contrarily to system
(I) where there is no preference (φ = 0.5). With this change, system (II) has a very
4

strong top down control by design. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2 (c, d) that show an
approximate net growth of zooplankton for the two systems. While for system (II) the net
growth rate of zooplankton is always positive Fig. 2 (d), this does not hold for system (I).
For very low abundances of phytoplankton, there is not enough food for zooplankton to
survive. Therefore, for very low nutrient supply and subsequently very low phytoplankton
abundance, zooplankton would go extinct.

As described previously the model takes into account the vertical influx of nutrients
from the deep ocean into the mixed layer where all biological processes take place. The
rate of this influx is given by k. This influx of nutrients may occur due to turbulent
diffusion (k = kd ) or by vertical transport due to upwelling (k = kup ). The diffusive
2
)
flux is Dv ∂∂zN2 ∼ Dv (N0h−N
, where N0 is the concentration of nutrients below the mixed
2
layer and h is an average extension of the gradient. By using the definition kd = Dh2v we
can rewrite the relation as kd (N0 − N ). For the ocean we find in the literature values
of Dv ∼ 0.1 − 2.6 m2 day−1 [2, 42]. We use the known extension of the thermocline to
estimate h and therefore adopt values from 10 to 25 m. With these parameters we can
evaluate kd in the range of 10−2 — 10−4 day−1 . The nutrient transport due to upwelling,
on the other hand, is defined as uz ∂N
∼ uz ∆N
. Therefore for the situation with upwelling
∂z
∆z
we can define the thermocline exchange rate as kup (N0 − N ) with kup = uhz + kd . It is
known that the vertical velocity uz may reach values as large as ∼ 40 m day−1 [42],
however specifically for the region of the Canarian Archipelago we find estimations close
to 10 m day−1 [43]. This gives us kup of 1 day−1 . Therefore in this work we restrict
ourselves to value for kup of the order of unity.
As already mentioned the nutrient influx is regulated by two parameters: the cross

thermocline exchange rate k and the nutrient concentration below the thermocline N0 .
It is therefore compelling to outline here how the coupled effect of these parameters is
reflected in the steady state community structure. These results are summarised in Fig. 3
(a) and (d) for system (I) and (II) respectively. The region of dominance of the toxic
species is shown in red, and of the non-toxic in green. We also set-up two values for
the cross thermocline exchange: kd and kup representing the conditions without and with
upwelling respectively.
Our choice for system (I) corresponds to kd = 0.015 and kup = 1.5. These values will
be used in all further simulations of system (I), unless stated otherwise. The dynamics of
the system towards the steady state for diffusive exchange kd = 0.015 is shown in Fig. 3
(b) and leads to a steady state with a dominance of the non-toxic species, see Tab. 1.
As explained previously the community structure in the system (I) directly reflects the
low amount of nutrients of this scenario. Please note that for kd = 0.015 the presence of
zooplankton allows for the coexistence of the two phytoplankton species. On the other
hand, for a high nutrient supply k = kup = 1.5 the dynamics leads to the dominance of
the toxic species and even the extinction of its competitor, see Fig. 3 (c).
The parameters chosen for the further analysis for system (II) are: kd = 0.0045 and
kup = 2.25. Again we find, that with a large input of nutrients the toxic species dominates,
see Tab. 1. However, the main mechanism how this dominance is achieved differs from
previous case as explained previously. Please note that here we observe a significant
amount of the total biomass concentrated at the higher trophic level, especially in the
low nutrient limit. Another distinction of this set-up is the presence of both species of
phytoplankton in the steady state for low as well as high nutrient influx Fig. 3 (e, f).

Coupled Model

The full biological-hydrodynamic model consists of the following reaction-advection-diffusion
system of equations:
∂C
+ ~u∇C = Fc + D∇2 C,
with
C ∈ [N, PN , PT , Z],
(2)
∂t
where C(x, y, t) represents the concentration of nutrients or plankton species in space
and time, and Fc are functions representing the biological interactions among these species,
which are given by the population dynamical model Eq.(1). We consider a horizontal
turbulent diffusion constant D = 10 m2 s−1 , that describes the advection by smaller
scales in the flow field. Please note that Eq.(1) describes the dynamics as vertically
averaged model only in the mixed layer while vertical transport is encapsulated in the
biological model considering only the vertical exchange of nutrients and the sinking of
phytoplankton (cf. subsection 2.2). The influx concentrations at the left boundary are
setup as 20% of the steady state values of Table 1. For numerical details please check
Supplemental material. The code for the simulation reported here can be found in the
Github repository: https://github.com/kseniaguseva/Upwelling.

Results
Hydrodynamic time scales

According to our aim to understand the conditions for HAB formation in the presence of
an intermittent upwelling, it is important to analyze the interplay between hydrodynamic
and biological time scales. We start the study of this nontrivial coupling by analysing the
hydrodynamics that underlies all the biological processes in our system. To that extend
we follow the motion of non-reacting fluid parcels passively transported by the flow field
(tracers). Since we are interested in the impact of upwelling we compute the residence
times of tracers starting in the upwelling region. Furthermore, we want to understand
how the residence times of tracers depend on the initial time instant of their release. We
measure it by releasing the tracers at a location (xi , yi ) and recording the time τi when
they reach the right boundary at x = 8.
We start by characterizing the possible trajectories that a tracer element can take
depending on its release time ti and its release coordinates (xi , yi ), see typical trajectories
and the respective τi in Fig. 4 (a). The main difference in τi arises from whether the tracer
is captured by a vortex in the wake or not: The ones captured into a circular trajectory
around the vortex core (black and gray trajectories in Fig. 4 (a)), spend at least two times
longer in the observation area than the ones that are transported more or less straight
7

by the main flow (red and blue trajectories of Fig. 4 (a)). Fig. 4 (b) summarizes our
results on residence times of trajectories starting at (xi = 0, yi , ti ). The periodicity of
the flow can be seen by the repeating patterns shown in Fig. 4 (b). The two finger-like
structures in the residence times (blue points) correspond to tracers that are captured by
the vortices. Another important characteristics of these patterns is their fractality (see
Fig. 4(c)), which directly reflects the influence of the stable and unstable manifolds of the
chaotic saddle present in the system [41, 32]. Note that although we have chosen to fix
xi at xi = 0, the results for other release positions within the upwelling region are very
similar.

In summary, when we identify the tracers with nutrients released during upwelling,
then the residence time of nutrients in the observation region changes with the position of
the upwelling region, the location of release within that region, and the time instant when
the nutrients are released. In other words, for how long nutrients, that have been released
into the mixed layer during upwelling, are available for consumption by phytoplankton in
the observation area depends crucially on the structure of the hydrodynamic flow at the
time instant of upwelling. Next we will investigate the consequences that this effect has
on the plankton dynamics.

Reaction to an upwelling pulse: spatio-temporal patterns

Before we start with the results of this section we shortly discuss the characteristics of the
system in the absence of upwelling. In the absence of upwelling the spatial distribution of
the biological species follow the uneven nutrient distribution in space. What is observed
is an accumulation of nutrients in certain areas, the observed accumulation appears due

to the small advective velocities around the island coupled with a constant nutrient influx
from below the thermocline (kd ). Subsequently, this high nutrient concentration is captured by the vortices behind the island. This results into a bloom of non-toxic species in
these regions in System (I), and a non-toxic bloom followed by the growth of zooplankton
in System (II), see Supplemental material for details. We define the values of the spatial
average over the observation region as hCi, where C stands for N , PN , PT or Z. In addition, we will also use a distinct notation for the time average of hCi for the case without

After having analysed the coupled hydrodynamic-biological model, let us characterize
the HAB formed in the two systems in the presence of a simple upwelling pulse. We
start by comparing the spatio-temporal patterns for the two biological systems for a case
where the upwelling event triggers a HAB. We introduce a single upwelling event at 2.5
T, at this instant the value kd at the upwelling area is exchanged to kup . It is kept at this
constant value for some time interval δ = 0.5, and then it is exchanged back to kd .
In system (I) the spatio-temporal distribution is simple: the non-toxic species grows in
the vortex cores undisturbed by the upwelling event, while the toxic species grows mainly
by feeding on nutrients released by the upwelling. Fig. 5 illustrates these dominance patterns for three instances of time that follow an upwelling event. Here we have specifically
chosen an upwelling event that triggers a strong dominance change. Please note the fast
reaction of the toxic species to the nutrient influx.

Figure 6: Spatial distribution of the dominance patterns which follow an upwelling event
at 2.5 T.
By contrast, in system (II) both phytoplankton species readily grow in response to
the nutrients. However there is a stronger response of the non-toxic species due to its
lower half saturation constant, which allows it to reach high concentration and initiate
the growth of zooplankton. However, the zooplankton development is a slow process
and it only reaches significant concentrations when the non-toxic bloom is captured by a
vortex. It is in this region where the toxic species, with extra nutrients and the presence
of zooplankton, can successfully compete with non-toxic species. In fact, the high grazing
pressure of zooplankton on the non-toxic species allows for the very localized dominance
of the toxic specie, see Fig. 6. Note that when the bloom of the toxic species forms, the
nutrients brought by the upwelling were already partially consumed.
We would like to emphasize that the spatio-temporal dominance patterns that appear
in this system in the presence of upwelling in system (I) and (II) strongly differ. This
difference can be explained by the fact, that the two spatio-temporal patterns result from
distinct biological mechanisms. The behaviour in system (I) is solely determined by the
bottom up control relying only on the supply of nutrients leading to a strong advantage of
the toxic species in areas of high nutrient concentration. By contrast, in system (II) the
top down control by the zooplankton is the dominant biological process shaping the spatiotemporal pattern. The toxic species can only dominate in areas, where its competitor is
kept at low concentration due to the high grazing pressure. Furthermore, the two set-ups
are characterised by different response times of the toxic species to the inflow of nutrients
in the two systems.

3.3

The impact of initial time of the upwelling event

In Sec. 3.1 we have illustrated that fluid parcels released at different times, ti , from
the upwelling region can take very distinct paths trough the observation area. Some of
these paths transport the fluid parcels directly away, describing a quick escape from the
observation area, while others consists of spiral trajectories around vortex cores. These
latter trajectories, in turn, are characterized by long residence times. In this section we
will connect the advection with the plankton dynamics. Our objective is to answer how
these different time scales affect the formation of HABs. Thus, we initialize upwelling
pulses starting from different initial times t0 , with a predefined duration δ and strength
kup .
Now we analyse how these upwelling events impact the time series of the spatial
averages of the plankton species of our biological model. While in the time series of system
(I) only the toxic species exhibits a strong response to the upwelling events, in system
(II) we observe, on the contrary, spikes in the growth of both phytoplankton populations
and even in the abundance of zooplankton (Fig. 7 (a,d)). Despite these differences, we
observe that in both systems the dynamics of the response of the plankton model to the
upwelling event depends on its initial time t0 : in both systems we can have weak or strong
responses, see Fig. 7 (a, d) and (b,e) respectively. This result is summarised in Fig. 7
(c,f) where the biomass of the toxic species is compared to the total biomass for an event
with duration δ = 0.5. While for system (I) which is solely nutrient controlled we observe
a dominance change for the average concentrations, this behaviour is absent for system
(II), which has a strong top down control element. In system (II) we observe only local
dominance change which never reaches a dominance of the toxic species in the spatial
average. Please note the similarity of the diagrams of the two biological systems. The
similarity of the response patterns for both systems (I) and (II) with respect to the timing
of the response is entirely determined by the hydrodynamics.

3.4

Impact of the duration and strength of the upwelling event

So far we have seen that the initial time of an upwelling event plays a crucial role for the
mechanism of formation of HABs. In this section we extend our analysis to investigating
the effect of the duration and the upwelling strength of randomly initialized upwelling
events.
We compose the sequence of upwelling pulses in the following way: The upwelling
events are initiated at particular time instants given by 4T n + t0n , where n ∈ N∗ and t0n is
chosen randomly for every n from the interval [0, T ], see Fig. 8 (a). We establish that each
sequence is characterized by upwelling events of duration δ and strength kup . To quantify
the effect of the upwelling on the growth of the phytoplankton species, the time series is
divided into n intervals: each one of them containing four periods and a single upwelling
event. The time series of the average concentration hCi for each one of these intervals
is denoted hCin . Thus, the effect of each upwelling event on the population dynamics is
reflected in the maximum, max(hCin ). Furthermore it is useful to systematically compare
max(hCin ) to the average concentration in the absence of upwelling, hCi∗ , we represent
this deviation by ∆ hCin = max(hCin ) − hCi∗ (see Fig. 8).

Figure 8: (a) Time series of the strength of the thermocline exchange rate at the upwelling
region; (b) Example of a time series of the spatial average of concentration of the toxic
species, with blooming events triggered by upwelling.
We start our analysis by fixing kup . In the resulting time series of system (I), see
Fig. 9 (a, b), the toxic species is the only species that shows a response to upwelling
in its average values. On the contrary, in system (II) all the species show a bloom-like
behaviour, Fig. 9 (c, d). It is clear that the average values shown for both of these systems,
fail to completely describe the complexity of the spatio-temporal dynamics. Nevertheless,
part of this complexity is revealed by the variability of different dynamic responses of the
biological community to seemingly identical upwelling events, see Fig. 9. Comparing the
different responses for the same system with the same duration, we notice that it depends
crucially on the timing of the upwelling event, how strong the response is going to be. This
revels clearly the importance of the structure of the flow field at the time instant of the
upwelling. Additionally, our results reveal that this variability depends on the duration
δ, and this relation manifests itself in a similar way for both systems (Fig. 9). Our results
reveal that longer upwelling events are associated with a vigorous growth of the toxic
species. For this case the probability of HABs is large and we observe similar peaks in the
concentration of the toxic species (large values of ∆ hPT in ). On the other hand, shorter δ
values reveal a larger variety of possible outcomes. These results are summarized in the
histograms of Fig. 10 (note the difference of the axes between the upper and the lower
panels). The observed behaviour can be explained by taking into account that HAB
12

formation depends on the temporal overlap between the upwelling event and the vortex
formation in the wake of the island. Naturally for larger δ the probability of this overlap
is higher and more nutrients are captured to incubate the growth of the toxic species. The
strength of upwelling events has a complementary influence. For small values of kup the
system needs longer upwelling events to release enough nutrients for toxic species bloom,
see the Supplemental material for details.

and (c, d) System (II) using: (a, c) kup = 1.0 and δ = 0.08; (b, d) kup = 1.0 and δ = 0.95.
At the end of this section we want to stress that from an analysis of the time series
only, it is especially difficult to establish a causal relation between the upwelling event and
the rate of increase of the toxic species. Although, an increase in the population of the
toxic species always follows the upwelling in our model system, the level of increase in the
population varies strongly, see Fig. 10 (d). This variety of the possible outcomes, however,
can be easily explained by coupling the biological model with hydrodynamic mesoscale
13

motion. Therefore by taking into account the interplay between the initial time of the
upwelling event and the formation of vortices in the wake, it is possible to predict if the
event will result in a HAB formation.

3.5

Intermittent upwelling events

In the previous sections we have seen that an upwelling pulse, even of the simplest possible
profile, can result in a variety of possible outcomes for the plankton growth. The intricate interplay between plankton dynamics and the formation of vortices, or more general
mesoscale hydrodynamic structures, results in time series showing responses of different
strengths for identical upwelling events. Here in this section we analyse the response
of our model to upwelling events that follow a time series that displays more complex
patterns. The idea here is to mimic a more realistic situation, since upwelling is a wind
driven phenomenon and hence, has an intermittent character. To generate this new time
series of upwelling events we use a dynamical system which displays a special type of
intermittent behaviour, known as “on-off” intermittency [44]. Two modes appear in this
system: the “off” mode (situation without upwelling) where a very small value of an observable of the system sets up for long intervals of time; these intervals are interrupted by
seemingly random bursts, characteristic to the “on” mode (upwelling events). Therefore
the thermocline exchange rate at the upwelling region in the “off” mode is kd and in an
“on” mode kup , which here assumes a set of random values obtained from the dynamical
system described in the Supplemental material.

Figure 11: Population dynamics in response to an intermittent pulses of upwelling for (a)
System (I) and (b) System (II).
Fig. 11 shows the response of our two biological systems to an identical sequence of
intermittent upwelling pulses shown in light gray Fig. 11. Note that in this system there
can be several short pulses of different strengths within a single period, furthermore the
events are not isolated but come in small groups. Each group of pulses triggers a different
outcome for the toxic population. Furthermore, as can be easily spotted in Fig. 11,
there is a very strong variability between possible responses. Note, for instance the weak
blooming behaviour of the toxic species around t = 2.5 in contrast to the strong response
at t ∼ 10. For system (I) we find at t ∼ 2.5 a rather long bloom with moderate amplitude,
while at t ∼ 10 the bloom exhibits a much higher amplitude. For system (II) we find a
similar response, but now not only for the toxic but also for the non-toxic one and the
zooplankton reflecting the importance of the grazing pressure in that case.

Conclusion

In this work, we have analysed how the competition, between two species for a shared limiting resource, can be affected by intermittent upwelling events providing an additional input of this resource. We have used a theoretical approach which couples the hydrodynamic
14

flow field with a biological model by means of reaction-advection-diffusion equations. Notably, we have tracked the necessary environmental conditions that trigger a HAB. We
were particularly interested on how the interplay of the hydrodynamic timescales as well
as the mesoscale hydrodynamics structures, like vortices in the flow, coupled to intermittent upwelling pulses influence the spatio-temporal distribution of dominance patterns
of different functional groups of phytoplankton. First we have characterized the HAB
formation in two biological scenarios: the first scenario where the abundance of nutrients
is the only factor responsible for the emergence of dominance patterns in the system;
and the second one, where the dominance patterns arise from combination of competition
for nutrients and grazing pressure from a higher trophic level. Both scenarios are characterized by distinct spatio-temporal inhomogeneous distributions of the phytoplankton
groups, which appear as a result of an upwelling event. In the first scenario the toxic
species develops along the whole nutrient plume, while in the second system a bloom is
formed in a very localized region namely on a narrow ring around one of the vortices
in the wake. The time of the bloom development also differs in these systems: in the
first one the response of the toxic species is almost immediate, while in the second one
the dominance change occurs while the vortex is advected away from the island. Despite
the observed differences in theses two systems we demonstrate that, in both of them,
the decisive factor triggering a bloom or not is the coupling of the upwelling event with
the formation of mesoscale vortices. In this scenario the HAB formation results from the
interplay of three timescales: (1) of the vortex formation at the island’s wake, (2) of the
upwelling event and (3) of the biological growth. Our analysis shows that identical upwelling events that start in different instances of time may result in a variety of outcomes
for the biological community depending on the properties of the flow at the moment of
upwelling. The observed response depends on the time interval that nutrients released
by upwelling spend in the observation region and consequently the quantity of nutrients
captured by the vortices. Therefore the variability of these possible outcomes depends
also on the duration and the strength of the upwelling events.
In summary we have observed that the HAB formation, independently of the biological
set-up, is tightly associated with the transport dynamics of the flow field. From our
analysis we conclude that without taking advection into account it appears to be not
possible to establish the relationship between upwelling events and triggering a HAB.
For this reason one cannot expect to find a functional dependence between upwelling
events and plankton blooms in general, when only nutrients and plankton abundances
are measured and no information about the flow field is available. Such measurements
lacking the properties of the flow field will always be difficult to interpret and allow only
conclusions when the flow field is simple and does not contain mesoscale hydrodynamics
structures.

Hydrodynamic model
The analytically defined model describes the velocity field for an incompressible viscid
fluid with a Reynolds number at which the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation is time
periodic. The period of the flow is T . During this time, two vortices are created in the
wake, with a phase shift of T /2, and move away from the island. The two vortices rotate
in opposite directions and are characterized by a vortex strength ω. One of them travels
slightly above and the other slightly below the axis at y0 . Please note that the assumption
of a two dimensional velocity field relies on the fact that the vertical velocities in the ocean
are significantly smaller compared to the horizontal ones. Additional dynamical properties
of the flow relevant to this work are reviewed in Sec. 3.1.
According to the situation in this geographical region the period of the flow T is 32
days. The parameters used for the flow field are shown in Table. 3. Also following [29]
we superimpose the Ekman flow uE in the y direction, perpendicular to the main flow,
for x > 1, see Fig.1 (a) of the main text.

Biological model
The functional responses used and the parameters are listed in Table 4 and Table 5
respectively. Please note that these differential equations are based on some traditional
NPZ models, such as of Steele & Henderson [45] and Edwards & Brindley [46]. An
important characteristics of these models is that the nutrient uptake by phytoplankton
fN,T (N ) (fN (N ) for the non-toxic species and fT (N ) for the toxic species) is given by
a Holling Type II functional response, while the grazing of zooplankton h considers a
Holling Type III functional response (see Table 4). Additional effects of interspecific and
intraspecific competition are given by the function g, where a/b is the maximum nutrient
uptake rate of phytoplankton averaged over the depth of the mixed layer. The differences
between the two groups of phytoplankton can be introduced through different parameters:
their nutrient conversion rates θN,T , half saturation constants eN,T , respiration rates rN,T ,
their feeding preference by zooplankton, φ, and their quality as food for zooplankton
expressed by the conversion rates αN,T . However, please note, that there is no direct
influence of the toxic species on the mortality of zooplankton. Therefore this model is
not restricted to HAB formation, but can be also used to describe the emergence of any
phytoplankton bloom, in which the two different competing species are involved. The
notation of toxic and non-toxic species simplifies the extension of our findings. The
recycling by bacteria is considered indirectly with factors β and γ for conversion of the
dead material back into nutrients.

Coupled Model
The full system of equations is solved using a semi-Lagrangian algorithm [31], the code
can be found at https://github.com/kseniaguseva/Upwelling. We use a grid of [500 × 300]
dt
points, the integration is carried out for step size dt = 0.01, and the diffusion step dtD = 10
Ddt
which guaranties that dxdy
< 0.5, so that the stability condition of the integrator is
fulfilled.
Everywhere in the observation area except for the prescribed upwelling region located
above the island, the cross thermocline exchange rate is set to kd . In the upwelling region
the value is exchanged between kd and kup in time, corresponding to intermittent upwelling
events. The upwelling region, if not stated otherwise, spans the region: x ∈ [−1, 1] and
y ∈ [2, 2.5], see Fig.1 of the main text.
All the modeled species enter the system from the left at x = −2 with the same
concentration at all y values and are advected across the observation area. We assume
that they arrive from the open ocean, an environment poor in nutrients and plankton.
Therefore we use as the influx 20% of the steady state concentration value reached by
each given species for a cross thermocline exchange rate kd . Please note that all species
of phytoplankton are present in the system in the influx. As we show in Sec.2.2 of the
20

main text the non-toxic species dominates in the influx conditions, since those are low in
nutrients, for both scenarios that we analyse.

Biological model with hydrodynamics, in the absence
of upwelling
Hare we present the dynamics of the coupled biological-hydrodynamic model without
upwelling to allow a comparison with the results in the main text. First, we can mention
that system (I) has very similar properties as the population dynamics analysed in [32].
But in contrast to [32] we are here more interested in the dynamics of plankton in the
whole area and not only in the development of a plankton bloom related to specific regions
such as vortices. When the upwelling is not present the non-toxic species is found in higher
concentrations in a region around the island and inside every vortex formed in the wake.
This spatial distribution of the non-toxic species reflects the nutrient accumulation in
those regions, which results from the vertical exchange of nutrients across the thermocline
while the horizontal advection is slow. Subsequently, this high nutrient concentration is
captured by the vortices behind the island, where it creates good conditions for the growth
of the non-toxic species. Nevertheless this accumulation of nutrients does not reach the
threshold to trigger a HAB. Notably, system (I) is characterized by a periodic timeseries for
the spatial average of the non-toxic species following the vortex formation and advection:
hPN i has a period T /2. For system (I) the averages correspond to: hPN i∗ = 0.042 gC
m−3 , hPT i∗ = 0.019 gC m−3 and hZi∗ = 0.005 gC m−3 , hN i∗ = 0.025 gC m−3 .
We continue with the characterization of the spatio-temporal patterns formed in system (II). For the scenario without upwelling the non-toxic species, as in the previous
case, develops around the island and inside the vortices. As in system (I), the growth
of phytoplankton also follows the large concentration of nutrients. The large presence of
non-toxic species creates now good conditions for the development of zooplankton, that
also grows in the same location but at a slower rate. As a result, this system displays
more complex spatio-temporal patterns, where as the vortices are advected by the flow
field the concentration of zooplankton increases as well. On the other hand due to the
large phytoplankton growth these vortices become depleted in nutrients. Therefore, without upwelling, conditions that would give an advantage to the development of the toxic
species are never met. In summary, in system (II) the non-toxic species is the dominant species everywhere in space with the average concentration hPN i∗ = 0.0084 gC m−3 ,
which is in agreement with low nutrient concentration in the system hN i∗ = 0.0286. The
average concentration of the other plankton species are: hPT i∗ = 0.0010 gC m−3 and
hZi∗ = 0.0054 gC m−3 . Furthermore, the average concentration of all species is about one
order of magnitude smaller than for system (I). This is a direct consequence of the used
values of the thermocline exchange rate.

Nutrient release from the upwelling region
Finally, we investigate the last parameter that controls the release of nutrients from the
upwelling region — the cross thermocline exchange rate kup . To get some insight of the
effect of kup on the growth of toxic species we compare the ∆ hPT in to the undisturbed
P ∆hP i
concentration value hPT i∗ . More precisely we calculate n1 n hPTTi∗n , for n = 150 upwelling
events for a range of kup and δ values. As expected small values of either kup or δ do not
trigger the growth of the toxic species. By contrast, for high values of these parameters,
the toxic species exhibits high growth in both systems. Fig. 12 shows the impact of these
21

two parameters simultaneously. Please note that kup may limit the HAB formation given
a fixed δ. The mechanism behind that is simple: the smaller kup , the more time is needed
for the released nutrients to reach a significant level for the toxic species development.
This means that for a small value of kup the initial times of upwelling events are even
more constrained, i.e. they have to start at the beginning of vortex formation to allow
for sufficient input of nutrients. In Fig. 12 we also show how the dominance change of
species depends on parameters δ and kup . To this end we compute the probability, PHAB ,
that the toxic species out-competes the non-toxic one as a result of an upwelling event,
PHAB = P (max(hPT i)n > max(hPN in )). This probability again is computed using the
time series with 200 upwelling events. In Fig. 12 (a) we delineate the region A, where
PHAB > 0.98. In this region most of the upwelling events lead to HABs. The region C
is restricted to parameters where PHAB < 10%, while the intermediate region B spreads
over the parameter range where many different outcomes are possible. Note that the sizes
of these regions depend on the parameters of the biological model. Since in the system (I)
mainly the toxic species responds to the upwelling event, the largest part of the parameter
spaces is covered by the region A. By contrast, as we have explained before, the dominance
change in system (II) is restricted to some spatial regions and therefore, region C spans
over the whole parameter space for this scenario, see Fig. 12 (b).

Figure 12: Responses of the toxic species to upwelling events of different duration δ and
kup in: (a) system(I) and (b) in system (II). The region A corresponds to PHAB > 0.98,
B to 0.1 < PHAB < 0.98 and C to PHAB < 0.1. The values were computed from a time
series with 150 upwelling events distributed over 600 T. The stars mark kup = 1.0 and
δ = 0.08, the histograms of the responses of the two phytoplankton species to upwelling
at this point are shown in Fig.10 (a,b) of the main text. The triangles mark kup = 1.0
and δ = 0.95, for the respective histograms see Fig.10 (c,d) of the main text.

Intermittency

To model the time series of intermittent upwelling events we use the absolute value of the
x1 variable from the system of the following differential equations:
x˙1
x˙2
x˙3
x˙4
x˙5

= x2 ,
= −x31 − 2x1 x3 + x1 x5 − µx2 ,
= x4 ,
= −x33 − ν1 x21 + x3 x3 − ν2 x4 ,
= −ν3 x5 − ν4 x21 − ν5 (x23 − 1),

(3)

where µ = 1.815, ν1 = 1., ν2 = 1.815, ν3 = 0.44, ν4 = 2.86, ν5 = 2.86. For these
parameters the system displays on-off intermittency, for details see [44].
22

To lead to upwelling events of the adequate duration we rescale the time in Eqs.(3)
using t0 = t/T , where T is the period of the flow field. The “off” states of the time
series from Eqs.(3) are characterized by |x1 | ∼ 0, and the “on” state by max(|x1 |) ∼ 1.
Therefore, we transform this time series to:
k(t0 ) = (kup − kd )|x1 (t0 )| + kd .

(4)

With this transformation the new time series has the “ off“ state ∼ kd and an “on”
state which can be at most kup . The time series k(t0 ) is used to define the cross thermocline
exchange rate at the upwelling region.
