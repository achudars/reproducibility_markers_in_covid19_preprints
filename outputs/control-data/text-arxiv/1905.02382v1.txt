A CONSTRUCTION OF PROJECTIVE BASES FOR
IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF
MULTIPLICATIVE GROUPS OF DIVISION ALGEBRAS
OVER LOCAL FIELDS
David Kazhdan
Abstract. Let F0 be a local non-archimedian field of positive
characteristic, D0 be a skew-field with center F0 and G0 := D0⋆ be
the multiplicative group of D0 . The goal of this paper is to provide
a canonical decomposition of any complex irreducible representation V of G0 in a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces.

Let k = Fq be a finite field, F := k(t) the field of rational functions
on the projective line P1 over k. Let S be the set of points of P1 .
For any point s ∈ S we denote by Fs the completion of F at s, by
νs : Fs → Z ∪ +∞ the valuation map and by Os ⊂ Fs the subring of
integers. We denote by A the ring of adeles for F .
Let D be a skew-field with center F unramified outside {0, ∞}, D0 :=
D ⊗F F0 and D∞ := D ⊗F F∞ . We have dimF (D) = n2 .
We denote by G the mutiplicative group of D considered as an algebraic F -group, write Gs := G(Fs ) and denote by Cc G0 ) ⊂ C(G0 ) the
algebra of locally constant compactly supported functions on G0 .
For any point s ∈ S, s 6= 0, ∞ we identify the group the group G(Fs )
with Gln (Fs ) and define Ks := Gln (Os ).
⋆
Let N∞ : G∞ → F∞
be the reduced norm. We define K∞ = {g ∈
1
D∞ |ν∞ (N∞ (g)) ≥ 0} and K∞
= {g ∈ D∞ |ν∞ (N∞ (g − 1)) > 0}. Then
1
K∞ ⊂ G∞ is an open compact subgroup and K∞ /K∞
= F⋆qn . We

define K 1 := s∈S−{0,∞} Ks × K∞
.
The multiplication defines a map
κ : G0 × K 1 × G(F ) → G(A)
This paper is based on the following result
Proposition 0.1. The map κ is a bijection.
Proof. The surjectivity follows from Lemma 7.4 in [2]. To show the
injectivity it is sufficient to check the equality
(D0∗ × K 1 ) ∩ GE = {e}
which is obvious.

Let R be the space of C-valued locally constant functions
Q on G(A)/G(F )K ,
Hs , s 6= 0, ∞ be the spheical Hecke algebra at s, H := s∈S−{0,∞} Hs .
We have a natural action a → â of the commutative algebra A :=
0

H ⊗ C[K∞
/K∞
] on R.

Corollary 0.2.
(1) The natural action of the group G0 on the space
X := G(A)/K 1 × G(F ) is simply transitive. So we can identify
X with G0 .
(2) The restriction to G0 defines a G0 -equivariant isomorphism u :
R → C(G0 ).
(3) For any irreducible representation V of G0 the restriction to G0
defines an isomorphism uV : HomG0 (V ∨ , L) → V where V ∨ is
the representation dual to V .
(4) There exists a map α : A → Cc (G0 ) such that
f ⋆ α(a)) = â(f ), a ∈ A, f ∈ Cc (G0 )
Let Ξ be the set of homomorphisms χ : H ⊗ C[F⋆qn ] → C. For any
χ ∈ Ξ we define Vχ := {v ∈ V |av = χ(a)v} for all a ∈ H ⊗ C[F⋆qn ]. Let
ΞV = {χ ∈ Ξ|Vχ 6= {0}}.
Theorem 0.3.
(1) dim(Vχ ) = 1 for all χ ∈ ΞV .
(2) V = ⊕χ∈ΞV Vχ .
Proof. As follows from [1] and [5] we have direct sum decomposition
V = ⊕χ∈ΞV Vχ
where the subspaces Vχ ⊂ V are H × G∞ -invariant and the representation ρ̃χ of H × G∞ on Vχ is irreducible. Since H is commutative
this implies the irreduciblity of the restriction ρχ of ρ̃χ to G∞ . By
definition we can consider ρχ as a representation of the quotient group
1
G∞ /K∞
= Z ⋉ F⋆qn where 1 ∈ Z acts by the Frobenious automorphism
on F⋆qn . It is easy to see that the restriction of any irreducible representation of the group Z ⋉ F⋆qn on F⋆qn is the direct sum of distinct
one-dimensional representations.

Question 0.4. Is the subalgebra α(A) ⊂ Cc (G0 ) invariant under the
natural action of the group of automorphisms of F ?
Remark 0.5. The paper [4] was influnced by [3] and is concerned with
the understanding of the local Langlands conjecture. This short paper
is a streamlined version of [4].
