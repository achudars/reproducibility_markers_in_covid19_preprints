Abstract
The interaction between the electromagnetic field inside a cavity and natural or artificial atoms
has played a crucial role in developing our understanding of light-matter interaction, and is central
to various quantum technologies. Recently, new regimes beyond the weak and strong light-matter
coupling have been explored in several settings. These regimes, where the interaction strength
is comparable (ultrastrong) or even higher (deep-strong) than the transition frequencies in the
system, can give rise to new physical effects and applications. At the same time, they challenge our
understanding of cavity QED. When the interaction strength is so high, fundamental issues like the
proper definition of subsystems and of their quantum measurements, the structure of light-matter
ground states, or the analysis of time-dependent interactions are subject to ambiguities leading
to even qualitatively distinct predictions. The resolution of these ambiguities is also important
for understanding and designing next-generation quantum devices that will exploit the ultrastrong
coupling regime. Here we discuss and provide solutions to these issues.

INTRODUCTION

Light-matter ultrastrong coupling (USC) [1, 2] can be achieved by coupling many dipoles
(collectively) to light, or by using matter systems like superconducting artificial atoms whose
coupling is not bound by the small size of the fine-structure constant. The largest lightmatter coupling strengths have been measured in experiments with Landau polaritons in
semiconductor systems [3] and in setups with superconducting quantum circuits [4]. Another potentially promising route to realize USC with natural atoms and molecules is using
metal resonators, since the coupling rates are not bound by diffraction. Single molecules
in plasmonic cavities are starting to enter the USC regime [5], and two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) coupled to metal particles have already reached the
USC regime [6], even at room temperature. Ultrastrong plasmon exciton interactions has
also been reported with crystallized films of carbon nanotubes [7]. The physics of the USC
regime can also be accessed by using quantum simulation approaches (see, e.g., [8]).
These very strong interaction regimes also turned out to be a test bed for gauge invariance
[9–11]. The issue of gauge invariance, first pointed out by Lamb in 1952 [12], has constantly
affected the theoretical predictions in atomic physics and in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) (see, e.g., [13–16]). Recently, it has been shown that the standard quantum
Rabi model, describing the coupling between a two-level system (TLS) and a single-mode
quantized electromagnetic field, heavily violates this principle in the presence of ultrastrong
light-matter coupling [9, 10]. This issue has been recently solved by introducing a generalized
minimal-coupling replacement [11].
A distinguishing feature of USC systems is the presence of entangled light and matter
excitations in the ground state, determined by the counter-rotating terms in the interaction
Hamiltonian [17–19]. Actually, all excited states are also dressed by multiple virtual excitations [20]. Much research on these systems has dealt with understanding whether these
dressing excitations are real or virtual and how they can be probed or extracted [1, 2]. These
vacuum excitations can be converted into real detectable ones (see, e.g., [20–26]). However,
the analysis of these effects is affected by possible ambiguities arising from the gauge dependence of the system eigenstates [10, 11, 27]. Specifically, the unitary gauge transformation
does not conserve virtual excitations, nor light-matter entanglement [27]. Hence, the definition of these key features of the USC regime is subject to ambiguities, so that, as we show

Ambiguities are not limited to those properties dependent on virtual excitations, but
also affect physical detectable photons. This issue originates from the gauge dependence
of the field canonical momentum (see, e.g., Refs. [13, 14, 16]). According to the Glauber’s
photodetection theory [28], the detection rate for photons polarized along a direction i is
(−)

proportional to hψ|Êi Êi |ψi, where Ê

are the positive and negative frequency com-

ponents of the electric-field operator. In the Coulomb gauge, Ê is proportional to the field
canonical momentum and can be expanded in terms of photon operators. On the contrary,
in the multipolar gauge, the canonical momentum that can be expanded in terms of photon
operators is not Ê but the displacement operator D̂. This subtlety is generally disregarded,
and the usual procedure is to obtain the system states in the dipole gauge (the multipolar
gauge after the electric-dipole approximation) |ψD i, and to calculate the photodetection rate
ignoring that in this gauge the electric field operator is not a canonical momentum. As we
show here, this procedure, when applied to the quantum Rabi model, can lead to strongly
incorrect predictions. In this article, we face and solve all these issues by adopting an ap4

proach based on operational procedures involving measurements on the individual light and
matter components of the interacting system.
The exploration of fundamental quantum physics in the strong coupling [29] and USC
regimes [1, 2] has greatly evolved thanks to circuit QED systems based on superconducting
artificial atoms coupled to on-chip cavities [30]. We show that these systems are not free
from gauge ambiguities and, despite displaying energy spectra very similar to traditional
cavity QED systems, have drastically distinct measurable ground-state properties, like the
photon number and the entanglement.

QUANTUM RABI HAMILTONIANS

Let us consider a simple cavity QED system represented by a single atom (dipole) coupled
to an optical resonator. We start adopting the Coulomb gauge, where the particle momentum
is coupled only to the transverse part of the vector potential Â. It represents the field
coordinate, while its conjugate momentum is proportional to the transverse electric field
operator. The latter (as well as the vector potential) can be expanded in terms of photon
creation and destruction operators: ÊC (r, t) =
q

k

Ek (r)âk e−iωk t + h.c., where Ek (r) =

~ωk /2ε0 fk (r) are the effective mode amplitudes, and h.c. represents hermitian conjugate.

Here, fk (r) are any general “normal modes” with real eigenfrequencies, ωk , obtained from
Maxwell’s equations for a particular medium. They are normalized and complete (including
also the longitudinal modes, ωk = 0), so that

where p̂C and V (r) are the particle’s canonical momentum and potential.
The quantum Rabi Hamiltonian, can be obtained considering a single two-level system
(TLS) at position r0 , with (real) dipole moment µ = qhe|x|gi, interacting with a single
cavity mode [(âk , fk , ωk ) → (â, fc , ωc )]. The correct (namely, satisfying the gauge principle)
quantum Rabi Hamiltonian [11], strongly differs from the standard quantum Rabi model:

In cavity QED, the multipolar gauge after the dipole approximation (dipole gauge) represents a convenient and widely used choice. A generic system operator in the multipolar
gauge ÔM is related to the corresponding operator in the Coulomb gauge ÔC by a suitable
unitary Power-Zienau-Woolley (PZW) transformation [16, 31] ÔM = T̂ ÔC T̂ † (see Appendix
A). It turns out that in the multipolar gauge, while the field coordinate remains unchanged,
its conjugate momentum is Π̂M = −0 b (r)ÊM − P̂ = −D̂M , where P̂ is the electric polarization and D̂M is the displacement field [13, 32, 33], which can be directly expanded in
terms of photon operators:

where F̂M is the effective electric field that atomic dipoles couple to [33]. For a single dipole
at position r0 , the interaction Hamiltonian is HI = −qx · F̂(r0 ) + (qx)2 /0 b (r0 ). Considering
a single TLS, we obtain

where ÊD (r) is the electric field operator in the dipole gauge. We note that for spatial

ÊD (r) in a way that makes each mode contribution clear:

We now consider the single-mode limit, which is typically assumed in models such as the

where â0 (t) = â(t) + iησ̂x (t). We observe that the operators â and â † obey the same
commutation relations of the bosonic operators â and â† . The total Hamiltonian (throughout
the article we use the calligraphic font for operators projected in a two level space) in the
dipole gauge is
ĤD = Ĥfree + V̂D ,
6

(7)

where Ĥfree = ~ωc â† â + ~ω2 0 σ̂z , ω0 is the transition frequency of the TLS, and the interaction
Hamiltonian is
V̂D = iη~ωc (â† − â)σ̂x .

(8)

The two gauges are related by the transformation ĤD = T̂ ĤC T̂ † , where T̂ = exp(iF̂) with
F̂ = −ησ̂x (â + â† ) (see Appendix A).

III.

PHOTODETECTION

The photon rate that can be measured placing a point-like detector in the resonator at
the position r and at a given time t is proportional to [28]
hÊ(−) (r, t) · Ê(+) (r, t)i ,

(9)

where Ê(+) and Ê(−) are the positive and negative frequency components of the electric-field
operator, with Ê(−) = [Ê(+) ]† (see Appendix B). Note that, in the absence of the interactions,
or when the rotating-wave approximation can be applied to the interaction Hamiltonian, the
positive-frequency operator only contains destruction photon operators. However, when the
rotating-wave approximation cannot be applied, this direct correspondence does not hold
[34]. By using the input-output theory (see Appendix J), analogous results for the rate of
emitted photons can be obtained for a detector placed outside the cavity [35].
Considering a single-mode resonator coupled to a TLS (quantum Rabi model), assuming
that the system is prepared initially in a specific energy eigenstate |jC i, and using Eq. (9),
then the resulting detection rate in the Coulomb gauge is proportional to
W =

|hkC |P̂|jC i|2 ,

(10)

where
P̂ = i(â − â† ) ,

(11)

and we ordered the eigenstates so that j > k for eigenfrequencies ωj > ωk . If a tunable
narrow-band detector is employed, a single transition can be selected, so that the detection
rate for a frequency ω = ωj,k ≡ ωj − ωk is proportional to
Wj,k = |hkC |P̂|jC i|2 .

Rabi Hamiltonian ĤC (or ĤD ) for the case of zero cavity-atom detuning (ωc = ω0 ). Here we

It is interesting to point out some noteworthy features of this comparison. First, we

These results originate from the dependence on η of the corresponding transition frequencies
ω1̃±,0̃ . Specifically, photodetection is an energy absorbing process, whose rate is proportional
to the intensity, which in turn is proportional to the energy of the absorbed photons. Hence,
ω1̃+,0̃ > ω1̃−,0̃ implies W1̃+,0̃ > W1̃−,0̃ . For the same reason, when ω1̃−,0̃ → 0, there is

READOUT OF A STRONGLY COUPLED QUBIT

While in the Coulomb gauge, the atom momentum is affected by the coupling with the
field [16] [mẋ = p̂C − q Â(x)], in the dipole gauge it is interaction-independent: mẋ = p̂D .
This feature can give rise to ambiguities in the definition of the physical properties of an
atom interacting with a field [15]. Moreover, an unambiguous separation between light and
matter systems becomes problematic with increasing coupling strength. Again, we face
this problem by adopting an operational approach based on what is actually measured.
In cavity and circuit QED quantum-non-demolition measurements are widely used [37–42].
Specifically, a quantum-non-demolition-like readout of the qubit can be realized by coupling
it, with a moderate coupling strength, to a resonator mode b with resonance frequency ωb .
The readout can be accomplished by detecting the dispersive qubit state-dependent shift of
the resonator frequency: ωb → ωb + χhσ̂z i, where χ = ωb2 ηb2 /(ω0 − ω) [29, 40, 43, 44]. If the
qubit is coupled very strongly to a second field-mode a, this readout scheme can provide
9

interesting information on how the qubit state is affected by the USC regime. However,
the expectation value hσ̂z i for a qubit in the USC regime is ambiguous when the coupling
becomes strong. Specifically, since hψC |σ̂z |ψC i 6= hψD |σ̂z |ψD i, the question arises which of
these two quantities is actually detected?
We start from the Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge Eq. (1), limited to include only
two quantized normal modes (a and b). We then project the atomic system in order to
consider two levels only, and assume for the resulting coupling strengths that ηb  ηa .
If the USC system is in the state |ψC i, applying the standard procedure for obtaining
dispersive shifts [44], we find for the readout mode b: χhψC |T̂a† σ̂z T̂a |ψC i = χhψD |σ̂z |ψD i,
where T̂a† σ̂z T̂a = σ̂z cos [2η(â + â† )] − σ̂y sin [2η(â + â† )] (see Appendix C). Hence, we can
conclude that the readout shift provides a measurement of the expectation value of the bare
qubit population difference, as defined in the dipole gauge. Interestingly, this measurement
is able to provide direct information on the ground state qubit excitations induced by the
interaction with resonator a.
The dot-dashed curves in Fig. 3 display the qubit excitation probabilities that can be measured by dispersive readout: hiC |T̂a† σ̂+ σ̂− T̂a |iC i = hiD |σ̂+ σ̂− |iD i, together with hiC |σ̂+ σ̂− |iC i,
for the two lowest energy levels of the quantum Rabi model (notice that 2σ̂+ σ̂− = σ̂z + Î
where Î, is the identity operator in the TLS space) . As shown in Fig. 3, hiD |σ̂+ σ̂− |iD i
strongly differs from hiC |σ̂+ σ̂− |iC i. An analytical description of these results in the largecoupling limit is provided in Appendix D.

LIGHT-MATTER ENTANGLEMENT AND NON-ADIABATIC TUNABLE

COUPLING

One of the most interesting features of USC systems is the presence of entangled ground
states with virtual excitations [1, 2]. However, since the ground state of a cavity QED
system is gauge dependent (e.g., |ψD i = T̂ |ψC i), the mean numbers of excitations in the
ground state are gauge dependent. Moreover, the unitary operator T̂ does not preserve the
atom-field entanglement. Since physical observable quantities cannot be gauge dependent,
the question arises if these ground state properties have any physical meaning. Actually, it
is known that these excitations, e.g., the photons in the ground state, are unable to leave the
cavity and can be regarded as virtual (see, e.g., Refs. [20, 45]). However, if the interaction

coupling strength η. Note that hσ̂+ σ̂− iD corresponds to what is measured via dispersive readout of
the qubit (see text). On the contrary, the photon rate released by the qubit after a sudden switch
off of the light-matter interaction is proportional to hσ̂+ σ̂− iC (see Sect. V).

is suddenly switched off (with switching time T going to zero), the system quantum state
remains unchanged for regular Hamiltonians [46], and the excitations in the ground state,
can then evolve according to the free Hamiltonian and can thus be released and detected
(see, e.g., [23]). Of course detectable subsystem excitations and correlations have to be gauge
invariant, since the results of experiments cannot depend on the gauge. On this basis we
can define gauge invariant excitations and qubit-field entanglement.
It is instructive to analyse these quantities by using both the Coulomb gauge and the
dipole gauge. We start with the Coulomb gauge. We consider the system initially prepared
in its ground state |ψC (t0 )i = |0̃C i. At t = t0 , the interaction is abruptly switched off within
a time T → 0. This non-adiabatic switch does not alter the quantum state [46], which at
t ≥ t1 = t0 + T evolves as |ψC (t)i = exp [−iĤfree (t − t0 )]|ψC (t0 )i. We can use this state
to calculate, e.g., the observable mean photon number: hψC (t)|â† â|ψC (t)i, which can be

measured by detecting the output photon flux from the resonator. It is worth noting that
this expectation value can also be calculated by using the dipole gauge, by applying the
unitary transformation to both the operator and the quantum states: hψC (t)|â† â|ψC (t)i =
0

hψD (t)|â † â0 |ψD (t)i.
The Hamiltonian in the dipole gauge can be obtained from that in the Coulomb gauge via
12

a unitary transformation which, in this case becomes time-dependent. It can also be obtained
by considering the corresponding gauge transformation of the fields potentials, taking into
account that, during the switch, the transformation depends explicitly on time. Carrying
out the calculations in the dipole gauge (see also Appendix F), it can be shown that, even in
the presence of a non-adiabatic switch off of the interaction, there are no gauge ambiguities
if the explicit time-dependence of the transformation (or of the generating function for the
gauge transformation) is properly taken into account.
In order to test explicitly gauge invariance in the presence of ultrastrong interactions and
non-adiabatic tunable couplings, we calculate the quantum state after a sudden switch off
of the interaction, by using the dipole gauge. During the switch, the transformation is timedependent and can be expressed as T̂ (t) = exp [iλ(t)F̂], where λ(t) is the switching function
[with λ(t) = 1 for t ≤ t0 , and λ(t) = 0 for t ≥ t1 ]. The resulting correct Hamiltonian in the
dipole gauge is
ĤD (t) = Ĥfree + V̂D (t) − λ̇F̂ .

(14)

For very fast switches, the last term in ĤD (t) dominates during the switching and goes to
infinity for switching times T → 0. Hence its contribution to the time evolution during the
switching time cannot be neglected. Let us consider the system at t = t0 (before the switch
off) to be in the state |ψD (t0 )i. Assuming T → 0, just after the switch off (t1 = t0 + T ), the
resulting state is


|ψD (t1 )i = exp iF̂

Z t1



dtλ̇ |ψD (t0 )i.

(15)

Since the integral is equal to −1, and |ψD i = T̂ |ψC i, we obtain
|ψD (t1 )i = T̂ † |ψD (t0 )i = |ψC (t0 )i .

(16)

This result shows that, even in the presence of a non-adiabatic switch off of the interaction,
there are no gauge ambiguities, since the final state (after the interaction has been switched
off) does coincide with the corresponding state in the Coulomb gauge. The case where
the system is prepared in the absence of interaction, which is then switched on and finally
switched off before measurements, is analyzed in Appendix F.
In Ref. [27], it has been shown that the standard practice of promoting the coupling to a
time-dependent function gives rise, for sufficiently strong and non-adiabatic time-dependent
interactions, to gauge-dependent predictions on final subsystem properties, such as the qubitfield entanglement or the number of emitted photons. This problem persists also when the
13

system is prepared in the absence of interaction, and measurements are carried out after
switching off the coupling. Our analysis of gauge transformations in the presence of timedependent interactions eliminates these ambiguities (see Appendix E).
Figure 4(a) displays the mean photon numbers h0̃C |â† â|0̃C i and h0̃D |â† â|0̃D i. The first
quantity is the correct one, calculated using the time evolution induced by ĤC (t). The
latter is the wrong one, obtained considering the wrong dipole-gauge Hamiltonian ĤD (t) =
T̂ (t)ĤC (t)T̂ † (t) (see Appendix F). As shown in Fig. 4(b), the two mean values provide
very different predictions for the observable mean photon number after the switch off. Very
different predictions are also obtained for the qubit excitation probabilities (see Fig. 3).
Figure 4(c) displays the Von Neumann entropy Sq (which quantifies the qubit-oscillator
entanglement for the system ground state (black curves) of the quantum Rabi model. This
quantity [17] is obtained by calculating the ground state of the combined system |0̃i, using
it to obtain the qubit’s reduced density matrix in the ground state ρq = Trosc {|0̃ih0̃|},
and then evaluating the entropy of that state Sq = −Trosc {ρq log2 ρq }. The continuous
curves have been obtained using the Coulomb gauge, while the dotted-dashed ones, within
the wrong dipole gauge (using ĤD (t)). It is interesting to observe that, for η & 0.2, the
degree of entanglement strongly differs in the two cases. In particular, while in the wrong
dipole gauge both states become entangled cat states [47] displaying maximum entanglement
above η = 2, Sq goes to zero in the Coulomb gauge, after reaching a maximum at η ' 0.6.
These significant differences for large values of η can be understood by using an analytical
approximation which works well for η  1 (see Appendix D).
In summary, the main result of this section consists of an operational definition of ground
state entanglement in cavity-QED systems which is independent on gauge transformation

VI.

CIRCUIT QED

An ideal platform for exploring atomic physics and quantum optics [48] is circuit QED
(see Fig. 1(b)). The main reasons for that are, their flexibility in design, the possibility of
parameter tunability in situ [49] and their capability to reach the USC and even the so-called
deep strong coupling (DSC) (when η > 1) regimes at the single photon – single atom level
[1, 2, 4, 50, 51].
Here, we start considering a well known architecture constituted by a superconducting
14

flux qubit and a LC oscillator inductively coupled to each other by sharing an inductance
[4] (Galvanic coupling). An important feature of the flux qubit is its strong anharmonicity,
so that the two lowest energy levels are well isolated from the higher levels [4]. The system
Hamiltonian can be written in the flux gauge as (see Appendix G)
Ĥfg =

~ω0
σ̂z + ~ωc â† â + ~ωc η(â + â† )(cos θ σ̂x − sin θ σ̂z ) ,

where ~ωc η = Lc Ip Izpf . Here, Lc is the qubit-oscillator coupling inductance, Ip is the persistent current in the qubit loop, and Izpf is the zero-point-fluctuation amplitude of the LC
resonator. The flux dependence in encoded in θ = arcsin(ε/ω0 ), where ε is the flux bias.
√
Here ω0 = ∆2 + ε2 , where ~∆ is the tunnel energy splitting. For θ = 0, the qubit parity is
conserved, and the Hamiltonian in Eq. (17) resembles the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian in the
dipole gauge for natural atoms ĤD . However, it is worth noticing that, while the interaction
term in ĤD is of the coordinate-momentum kind, in Ĥfg it is coordinate-coordinate. As we
will show, this difference, despite not affecting the energy levels of the total system, affects
eigenstates and physical observables, and hence quantum measurements.
The LC oscillator can be probed by measuring the voltage at the end of a coplanar
transmission line that is inductively coupled to the inductor L of the LC oscillator (see
Fig. 1(b) and Appendix J). Such voltage is proportional to the voltage across L. In the flux
gauge, the canonical coordinate for the resonator corresponds to the flux across the capacitor
[Φ̂C = (Izpf /Z)(â + â† )] (Z =

q

L/C is the oscillator characteristic impedance), and not that

across the inductor. As a result, in analogy with the electric field in the dipole gauge, the
voltage across the inductor also contains qubit operators: V̂Lfg = L0 Izpf [iωc (â − â† ) + 2ηω0 σ̂y ]
(see Appendix J). If the system is prepared (e.g., by a pulse with central frequency ω ' ω1̃±,0̃ )
in one of the two lowest excited states |1̃±i, the output signal emitted into the transmission
L
line is proportional to V1̃±,
= |h1̃ ± |V̂L |0̃i|2 /(ωc L0 Izpf )2 . This quantity differs from what can

between these two quantities indicate that, in the USC and DSC regimes, similar observables
can lead to very different results, as recently observed in the context of quantum phase
transitions [52]. Comparing these results with the corresponding ones (W1̃±,0̃ ) obtained in
Fig. 2 for the cavity QED system, significant differences can be found, although the results
share some qualitative features.

The Hamiltonian in Eq. (17) can also be obtained (in full analogy with the dipole and
Coulomb gauges), in the so-called charge-gauge, performing a unitary transformation [10, 11,
53] (see Appendix G). After such transformation, the voltage across the oscillator inductor
corresponds to the oscillator canonical momentum: V̂Lcg = L0 Izpf [iωc (â − â† )]. However, its
matrix elements are gauge invariant (of course using the system states in the charge gauge).
Interestingly this gauge transformation corresponds to a different choice of the grounded
node in the circuit (see Appendix G).
The switch off of the interaction in Galvanically coupled systems also quenches the qubit
coordinate. Hence, these systems are not suitable to study qubit properties after the sudden
switch off. We consider instead a mutual-inductance coupling [see Fig. 1(b)]. The system
Hamiltonian is still described by Eq. (17); however in this case, after the switch off, the
qubit and oscillator signals can be independently measured (see Appendix H), as in cavity
QED systems (see Sect. V).
Results on measurable vacuum expectation values are shown in Fig. 5(b). Specifically, it
displays the mean photon number, the qubit excitation probability, and the Von Neumann
entropy (quantifying the qubit-field entanglement) in the system ground state. It is interesting to observe that these results strongly differ from the corresponding ones in Figs. 2 and
3. In particular, in the circuit QED system, the mean photon number strongly increases for
increasing coupling strengths. In addition, in the limit of very strong coupling strengths,
the qubit-field entanglement reaches its maximum in contrast to the correct calculation in
Fig. 3(a). It is very surprising that two platforms (cavity and circuit QED) displaying the
same energy spectra give rise to very different ground state properties. This behaviour arises
from the different fundamental origin of the coupling in the two systems, namely coordinatemomentum versus coordinate-coordinate interaction forms (see last paragraph in Appendix
H).
Also for the case of mutual inductance coupling, it is possible to apply a unitary (gauge)
transformation giving rise to a momentum-momentum coupling (charge gauge, see Appendix H). Such transformation is time-dependent if the mutual inductance is tuned, like
the unitary transformation T̂ introduced to obtain the dipole gauge. Analogously, it can be
shown that after the switch off |ψcg i = |ψfg i and no gauge ambiguity arises. Hence, also in
circuit QED, it is possible to define gauge-invariant ground state properties.

DISCUSSION

By adopting an approach based on operational procedures involving measurements, we
have highlighted and solved a number of qualitative ambiguities in the theoretical description of cavity and circuit QED systems. Broadly, these results deepen our understanding
of subtle, although highly relevant, quantum aspects of the interaction between light and
matter, and are also relevant for the design and development of new technological photonic
applications exploiting the unprecedented possibilities offered by the USC and DSC regimes
(see, e.g., [54]).
Here, we focused on the quantum Rabi model. However, our results can be extended to
matter systems including a collection of quantum emitters, or collective excitations (see, e.g.,
[52, 55]). The conceptual issues discussed and solved here also apply to light-matter systems
involving multi-mode resonators [45, 56–58], or to atoms (natural or artificial) coupled to a
continuum of light modes [59], or even in cavity quantum optomechanics [60, 61].

Appendix A: Derivation of the photon operators in the dipole gauge

We start by considering the simplest case of a two-level system coupled to a single-mode
resonator, where â is the photon destruction operator in the Coulomb gauge. Following
Ref. [11] (see also Sect. II), the corresponding operator in the dipole gauge is â0 = T̂ âT̂ † ,
where T̂ = exp(iF̂) with F̂ = −ησ̂x (â + â† ). We obtain â0 = â + iησ̂x , where η = g/ωc (g is
assumed real).
We now check the consistency of this result by deriving the general case using an alternative approach not based on unitary transformations. Specifically, we consider a single
two-level system interacting with a collection of complete electromagnetic modes, and then
generalize the result to a strict single-mode coupling regime.
It is well known [13, 32, 62] that the dipole interaction Hamiltonian between an atom
and the radiation field, should involve the transverse displacement field, D̂, rather than the
electric field, Ê, so that (we neglect a µ2 term that is trivially proportional to the identity
operator in a two-level approximation):
ĤI = −

µ · D̂(r)
,
0 b (r)

(A1)

where b (r) is the background dielectric constant of the medium where the two-level system is
embedded. The point is that in the dipole gauge the electric field operator is not a canonical
operator and thus the energy has to be expressed in terms of D̂(r) (which is a canonical
operator), in order to obtain the interaction Hamiltonian. Given the displacement field’s
fundamental importance [33], we introduce a new field operator through
F̂(r) =

D̂(r)
,
0 b (r)

(A2)

and carry out field quantization with respect to this quantum field operator. Thus, for a
single dipole at position r0 ,
ĤI = −µ · F̂(r0 ),

(A3)

and below we assume µ is real (though this is not necessary). This procedure can be generalized for multiple dipoles, however, in this case the field-induced dipole-dipole interaction
terms have to be also included (see Appendix B). In this Section, we only consider a single
dipole (two-level system) at r0 . The field operator, obtained from the Power-Zienau-Woolley
19

(PZW) transformation, can be expanded in terms of photon field operators (that also couple
to matter degrees of freedom), âk , so that

(A11)

Also note, that since ÊD (r 6= r0 , t) = F̂(r, t), then one can use either operator for field
detection analysis (away from the two-level system), which is a result of including a sum
over all modes. It is also important to note that the general solution of âk (t) also includes
coupling to the two-level system, which can be obtained, e.g., from the appropriate Heisenberg equations of motion. It is worth noticing that Eq. (A9) can be rewritten in a way that
makes each mode contribution more clear:
s

ÊD (r, t) = i

where
â0k (t) = âk (t) + iηk σ̂x ,
with ωk ηk =

q

(A13)

ωk /2~0 µ · fk (r0 ). Comparing Eq. (A12) and Eq. (A4), it is clear that,

although ÊD (r 6= r0 , t) = F̂(r, t), the electric field operator ÊD (r, t) and the field F̂D (r, t)
correspond to two different modal expansions.

Single-mode limit

Next, we focus on a single-mode solution (k = c, â ≡ âc , η ≡ ηc ) as this is typically
the most interesting case for cavity QED regimes, and is one of the key models considered
in the main text (the quantum Rabi model). Of course, treating a single-field mode as
a normal mode is not a rigorous model for open cavities, as we cannot include the cavity
mode loss rigorously, but similar result can be obtained using a quantized quasinormal mode
approach [63] (which are the correct resonant modes in the presence of dissipative output
losses). Nevertheless, for high-Q resonators, it is an excellent approximation. Exploiting
Eq. (A12), we obtain:
s

ÊD (r, t) ≈ i

~ωc
fc (r)â0 (t) + h.c. ,
20

(A14)

where
â0 (t) = â(t) + iησ̂x ,
21

(A15)

with ωc η =

ωc /2~0 µ · fc (r0 ). Again assuming that g is real, then g = ωc η, and ĤI =

i~g(â† − â)σ̂x ≡ V̂D , as used in the main text.
It is worth highlighting a rather striking difference between the single-mode model and
the multi-mode model. The latter case causes the two field operators F̂D (r) and ÊD (r) to
be identical, unless r at the dipole location (r0 ). This multi-mode result also enforces some
fundamental results in electromagnetism, e.g., it recovers well known limits such as the local
field problem (requiring the self-consistent polarization), and ensures causality. The need
to enforce causality in quantum optics has been pointed out in other contexts [45]. We also
observe that, as shown explicitly by the unitary transformation â0 = T̂ âT̂ † at the beginning
of this section (see also [11]), by only using the primed operators in the dipole gauge, gauge
invariance of the expectation values is ensured. Generalizing this approach to the multimodeinteraction case, it can also be shown that â0k = T̂ âk T̂ † , where T̂ is the appropriate unitary
0

gauge operator [16]. Consequently, hψD |âk† â0k |ψD i = hψC |â†k âk |ψC i, where |ψD i = T̂ |ψC i.

Appendix B: Two-level sensors

It has been shown that normal-order correlation functions, which describe the detection
of photons according to Glauber’s theory, can be calculated considering frequency-tunable
two-level sensors in the limit of their vanishing coupling with the field [64]. The rate at which
the sensor population growth corresponds to the photodetection rate. If two or more sensors
are included, their joint excitation rates provides information on normal-order multi-photon
correlations.
This procedure can also be applied when the electromagnetic field interacts strongly with
a matter system so that the counter-rotating terms in the interaction Hamiltonians cannot
be neglected. Let us consider a simple USC system constituted by an electromagnetic
single-mode resonator strongly interacting with a two-level system with normalized coupling
strength η. Then we also consider a two-level sensor interacting with the resonator with
vanishing coupling ηs  η. The standard cavity-sensor interaction Hamiltonian in the
dipole gauge is written as [64]
0
V̂dg
= −i~ωc ηs (â − â† )σ̂xs .

(B1)

If the USC system is prepared in a state |ji and the sensor has a resonance frequency
22

ωs = ωjl (l < j), by applying the Fermi golden rule, it results that the excitation rate of the
sensor is proportional to
|hlD |P̂|jD i|2 ,

(B2)

where |jD i is a system eigenstate in the dipole gauge and P̂ = i(â− â† ). This result, however
is different from what can be obtained within the Coulomb gauge: Wlj = |hlC |P̂|jC i|2 .
It is instructive to find the origin of such gauge ambiguity and to solve it. Actually, in
the dipole gauge, the interaction energy between the field and the sensor is − d3 r Ê · P̂s ,
R

where P̂s = µσ̂xs is the sensor polarization. Using the relation Ê = (D̂ − P̂)/0 (we here
assume b (r) = 1), the total Hamiltonian in the dipole gauge can be written as

Equation (B8) differs from Eq. (B1) only for the field-induced qubit-sensor interaction
term, arising from the self-polarization terms in the dipole-gauge light-matter interaction
Hamiltonian [65]. However, it is precisely this term that ensures gauge invariance: applying
the Fermi golden rule, by using Eq. (B8), instead of Eq. (B1), we obtain the gauge invariant
result
|hlD |P̂ − 2ησ̂x |jD i|2 = |hlC |P̂|jC i|2 ≡ Wlj .

Appendix C: Dispersive readout of a qubit strongly coupled to a cavity mode

Let us consider a two-level system ultrastrongly coupled to a cavity mode of frequency
ωa and weakly coupled to a second mode (e.g., a readout cavity) of frequency ωb acting as
a sensor for the matter system. The resulting Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge can be
written as [11]

Furthermore, since 2ηb (b̂† + b̂) is small, we can also apply the small-angle approximation

In order to investigate the effect of the readout cavity on the TLS, we can always perform

As it is clear from this expression, the last term in Eq. (C19) can be interpreted as a
dispersive shift of the cavity transition by χσ̂z0 , depending on the state of the qubit [66].
Sending a frequency-tunable probe signal into the resonator b, transmission spectroscopy
can provide direct information on the expectation value hσ̂z0 iC which coincides with hσ̂z iD .
Hence, we can conclude that this kind of readout spectroscopy provides direct information
on the expectation value of the qubit population difference, as defined in the dipole gauge.

Appendix D: Large-coupling limit

Here we discuss the large-coupling limit (η  1) by using an analytical perturbative
method. Notice that for η  1 the system enters in the so-called deep strong coupling
regime (DSC). We start from the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian in the dipole gauge:
ĤD = Ĥfree + V̂D ,

(D1)

where
Ĥfree = ~ωc â† â +

~ω0
σ̂z ,
2

(D2)

and the interaction Hamiltonian is
V̂D = iη~ωc (â† − â)σ̂x .

(D3)

When ηωc  ω0 , the last term in Eq. (D1) can be regarded as a perturbation. Equation (D2) can be rewritten as ĤD = Ĥ00 + V̂D0 , where
Ĥ00 = ~ωc â† â + iη~ωc (â† − â)σ̂x ,

(D4)

and
V̂D0 =

~ω0
σ̂z .
2

(D5)

In the limit η  1, V̂D0 can be regarded as a small perturbation; neglecting it, the resulting
Hamiltonian can be analytically diagonalized. The two resulting lowest-energy degenerate
26

eigenstates can be written as | ∓ iηi|±x i, where the first ket indicates photonic coherent
states with amplitude ∓iη, such that: â| ∓ iηi = ∓iη| ∓ iηi; while the second ket indicates
the two-qubit eigenstates of σ̂x . The perturbation (~ω0 /2)σ̂z removes the degeneracy and
mixes the two states, so that the two eigenstates become entangled:

properties of the displacement operator, we obtain the separable states
|ψC± i = |0i|±z i .

(D8)

Equations (D6) and (D8), describing the lowest two energy states in the dipole and
Coulomb gauge respectively (for η  1), explain the results in Figs 3 and 4 for very large
values of η. In particular, it is easy to obtain: hψC− |σ̂+ σ̂− |ψC− i = 0, hψC+ |σ̂+ σ̂− |ψC+ i = 1,

Eq. (D8) describes two separable states (SCq = 0), see Fig. 4. This analysis can be easily

Appendix E: Gauge transformations in the presence of time-dependent coupling

We start by summarizing some well-known results on equivalent descriptions of the dynamics of a physical system (see, e.g., Ref. [16]). We consider a simple 1D dynamical system
described by the Lagrangian L(x, ẋ), where x is the coordinate and ẋ the velocity. The
momentum conjugate with x is p = ∂L/∂x. By adding to the lagrangiaan L(x, ẋ) the total
time derivative of a function F (x, t), one obtains a new Lagrangian
L0 (x, ẋ) = L(x, ẋ) +

d
∂F

F (x, t) = L(x, ẋ) + ẋ

(E1)

which is equivalent to L in the sense that it gives the same equation of motion for the
coordinate x . Considering the new Lagrangian, the momentum conjugate with x becomes
p0 =

∂F
∂L0
=p+
.
∂ ẋ
∂x

(E2)

When one applies the standard canonical quantization procedure, starting with L on
the one hand and L0 on the other, one derives two equivalent quantum descriptions for the
system, related by a unitary transformation, described by the operator (we use ~ = 1)
T̂ = exp[iF̂ (t)] ,

(E3)

where F̂ (t) ≡ F (x̂, t) is the quantum operator corresponding to the classical function F (x, t),
with the hat “ ˆ ” indicating the promotion of classical variables to quantum operators.
Considering a generic operator Ô = O(x̂, p̂), it transforms as Ô0 = T̂ ÔT̂ † , while the state
vectors transform as |ψ 0 i = T̂ |ψi, so that the generic matrix elements of the operators remain
unchanged. If the function F (x, t) depends explicitly on time, the system Hamiltonain
transforms differently:
∂ F̂
˙
.
Ĥ 0 = T̂ Ĥ T̂ † + iT̂ T̂ † = T̂ Ĥ T̂ † −
∂t

(E4)

The function F introduced by PZW [31, 62] is
F =−

Z

d3 r P(r) · A⊥ (r) ,

(E5)

where, considering a single charge centered on a single reference point R, the polarization
operator can be expressed as
P(r) = q

Z 1

du(r − R)δ[(1 − u)(r − R)] .

(E6)

Hence, the PZW Lagrangian can be derived by that in the Coulomb gauge by the transformation
L0 = L +

(E7)

where F is given by Eq. (E5).
In a gauge transformation, defined by a function χ(r, t), the potentials become
A0 (r, t) = A(r, t) + ∇χ(r, t)
∂
U 0 (r, t) = U (r, t) − χ(r, t) .
∂t
28

(E8a)
(E8b)

Introducing Eqs. (E8a) and (E8b) in the Lagrangian L in the Coulomb gauge, the following
relationship between the two Lagrangians holds (see, e.g., p. 267 of Ref. [16]):
L0 = L +

d
χ(r, t) .
dt

(E9)

If the function χ(r, t) is chosen equal to the function F (r, t), then:
χ(r, t) =

Z

d3 r P(r) · A⊥ (r) .

(E10)

Equations (E7) and (E9) shows that the PZW transformation and the multipolar gauge
transformation are equivalent.
This equivalence still holds in the presence of a time-dependent interaction strength. As
discussed in the main text, a time-dependent coupling can be properly described assuming
an atom moving in and out a Fabry-Pérot Gaussian cavity mode, like in experiments with
Rydberg atoms [67], so that the coupling strength becomes time dependent. In this case, the
charge is localized around a time-dependent position R(t). This will give rise to additional
terms when taking the time derivative of F . However, Eq. (E7) and Eq. (E9) do still coincide,
as well as the conjugate momenta. Both approaches give rise to the same Hamiltonian in
Eq. (E4). Notice that the resulting Hamiltonian after the gauge transformation is different
from
ĤD (t) = T̂ (t)ĤC (t)T̂ † (t) .

(E11)

This explains precisely why the Hamiltonian in Eq. (E11) does not describe a dynamics which
is equivalent to that of the Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge [27]. In short, Eq. (E11) is not
a correct Hamiltonian to describe the correct light-matter interaction dynamics. Specifically,
considering the time dependent unitary transformation, Eq. (E11) is not correct because it
misses the explicit time dependence on the transformation, see last term in Eq. (E4). Considering the gauge transformation, Eq. (E11) is not correct because it is obtained neglecting
the explicit time dependence of χ(r, t) in Eq. (E8b), arising from the time dependence of R
in Eq. (E6). The correct Hamiltonian in the dipole gauge, in the presence of time-dependent
˙
0
interactions, is ĤD
= T̂ (t)ĤC (t)T̂ † (t) + iT̂ T̂ † .
In summary, in the absence of time-dependent interactions, the Coulomb gauge Hamil0
tonian ĤC and the standard multipolar gauge Hamiltonain ĤD = ĤD
provide equivalent
0
dynamics. In the presence of time-dependent interactions, only ĤD
provides a dynamics

29

which is equivalent to the one determined by ĤC , and the standard multipolar Hamiltonian ĤD has to be disregarded. Consequently, we can consider ĤC more fundamental than
ĤD . The first (ĤC ) originates directly from the minimal coupling replacement enforcing the
gauge principle, while the latter (ĤD ) results from the first, after a transformation which
can be time-dependent. A different point of view could be to consider, independently on the
historical derivation, ĤD as the fundamental Hamiltonian and deriving ĤC from it after a
unitary transformation. In this case the correct Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge, provid˙
ing a dynamics equivalent to that of ĤD (t), would be ĤC0 (t) = T̂ † (t)ĤD (t)T̂ (t) + iT̂ (t)† T̂ (t).
This Hamiltonain, owing to the second term on the right-hand side of the above equation,
does not correspond to a minimal coupling replacement as prescribed by the gauge principle.
On the contrary, ĤC is directly obtained by the minimal coupling replacement (which implements the gauge principle) after setting to zero the longitudinal component of the vector
potential (which has no dynamical relevance) [16].
Analogous considerations apply to the case of switchable circuit QED systems (see Appendix H). In this case the more fundamental gauge is the so-called flux gauge, which is
somewhat analogous to the dipole gauge. Also in this case, it is possible to apply a unitary
transformation, in order to obtain an equivalent representation, called the charge gauge.

Appendix F: Non-adiabatic tunable coupling: Switch-on and switch-off dynamics

Following Ref. [27], we consider the treatment of tuneable light-matter interactions
through the promotion of the coupling to a time-dependent function. In Ref. [27] it is
shown that applying the standard widespread procedure, for sufficiently strong light-matter
interactions, the final subsystem properties, such as entanglement and subsystem energies,
depend significantly on the definitions (gauges) of light and matter adopted during their
interaction. This occurs even if the interaction is not present at the initial and final stages
of the protocol, at which times the subsystems are uniquely defined and can be individually
addressed. Such an ambiguity is surprising and poses serious doubts on the predictability of
the system dynamics in the presence of ultrastrong time-dependent light-matter interactions.
Here we address this apparent problem by considering a light-atom system initially in
the absence of interaction and starting, e.g., in its ground state |ψ(tin )i = |g, 0i. A different
choice of the initial state does not change the conclusions. This situation can be visualized
30

considering a system constituted by an optical cavity (initially prepared in the zero-photon
state) and an atom initially external to the cavity and in its ground state. At t = t1 ,
the atom enters the cavity and flies out of it at t = t2 . We consider the case of a TLS
(the generalization to multilevel systems is straightforward). In addition, for the sake of
simplicity, we assume that for t1 < t < t2 the normalized interaction strength η is constant.
We demonstrate that, after the switch off of the interaction, the same quantum state is
obtained independently of the adopted gauge.
We start our analysis considering the Coulomb gauge. The initial state (actually independent on the gauge) is |ψC (tin )i = |g, 0iC . At t = t1 , the interaction is non-adiabatically
switched on within a time T → 0. This sudden switch has no effect on the quantum state
+
+
[46], hence, at t = t+
1 = t1 + T , |ψC (t1 )i = |g, 0i. For t > t1 , the quantum state evolves

as |ψC (t)i = exp [−iĤC (t − t1 )]|g, 0iC . Then, at t = t2 , the interaction is suddenly switched
+
off. At t = t+
2 = t2 + T , the system state is |ψC (t2 )i = exp [−iĤC (t2 − t1 )]|g, 0iC . For

t > t2 , the quantum state evolves according to the Hamiltonian for the noninteracting system (η = 0): |ψC (t)i = exp [−iĤfree (t − t2 )]|ψC (t+
2 )i, where Hfree is the system Hamiltonian
in the absence of interaction. We can use these quantum states to calculate any system
expectation value at any time. For example, the mean photon number can be calculated as
hψC (t)|Ŷ (−) Ŷ (+) |ψC (t)i ,

(F1)

where Ŷ (+) and Ŷ (−) are the positive and negative-frequency components of the operator
Ŷ = i(â − â† ) [with Ŷ (−) = (Ŷ (+) )† ]. Notice that, for t < t1 and t > t2 , Ŷ (+) = iâ.
Now we describe the same dynamics in the dipole gauge. Before switching on the interaction, the state is simply |ψD (t−
1 )i = |g, 0i. As shown in Appendix E, the system Hamiltonian
in the dipole gauge is
˙
ĤD (t) = T̂ (t)ĤC T̂ † (t) + iT̂ (t)T̂ † (t)
= Ĥfree + V̂D (t) − λ̇F̂ ,

(F2)

where λ(t) is the switching function (see Fig. 6). Notice that, when the interaction strength
is time independent, the last term in Eq. (F2) goes to zero. On the contrary, during nonadiabatic switches or modulations, this term can become the dominant one. Owing to the
presence of the last term in Eq. (F2), the state after the switch-on of the interaction becomes
|ψD (t+
1 )i

dtλ̇ |ψD (t−

(F3)

For t > t+
1 , the quantum state evolves as |ψD (t)i = exp (−iĤD (t − t1 )T̂ |g, 0i. Then, at
t = t2 , the interaction is suddenly switched off. At t = t+
2 = t2 + T the system state becomes
†
†
|ψD (t+
2 )i = T̂ exp [−iĤD (t2 − t1 )]T̂ |g, 0i. Since ĤC = T̂ ĤD T̂ , it implies that

+
|ψD (t+
2 )i = |ψC (t2 )i .

(F4)

As an example, we reported in Fig. (6) the gauge-invariant emission,
hψC (t)|Ŷ (−) Ŷ (+) |ψC (t)i ,

from a two-level system coupled to a single-mode resonator (quantum Rabi Hamiltonian)
induced by sudden switches of the light-matter interaction, calculated for three normalized
coupling strengths.
As a final remark, we observe that the procedure described here can be directly extended
to show that gauge invariance is also preserved for intermediate gauge transformations dependent on a continuous parameter α [10]. Indeed, it is sufficient to replace F̂ with αF̂ in
the demonstration.

Appendix G: Circuit QED: Galvanic Coupling

A qubit-resonator system is said to be Galvanically coupled when the two components
share a portion of their respective circuits [2]. With circuits, this strategy has been used
to reach both the USC and the deep strong coupling regimes. Besides, the generic lumped
circuit analysis is formally equivalent to the description of the fluxonium-resonator system.
Moreover, these architectures seem to be optimal test-beds for performing experiments on
the gauge issues discussed in this work.
To analyse the different architectures in a unified way, we consider the qubit as a ”blackbox”, while the coupler is the part shared with the resonator. The lumped circuit is drawn
in Fig. 7. The coupler can be an effective inductance and the dashed region can describe,
e.g., the three junctions forming the flux qubit as in the experiments [4, 50] or one of the
qubit-junctions as in this other experiment [59].

Flux gauge

In the flux gauge, the Lagrangian can be written as [68],
1

Lfg = L0qubit + C Φ̇2 −
(Φ − Φq )2 .
2
2L

(G1)

Here, L0qubit describes the qubit part, which depends on the specific artificial atom considered
and

− Φq )2 provides the coupling term. Recall that here Φ is the flux through the
33

Figure 7. Circuit QED systems with Galvanic coupling. (a) In the flux gauge the chosen coordinates
correspond to the flux across the qubit Φq and the flux across the ocillator capacitor Φ. (b) In the
charge gauge the chosen coordinates correspond to the flux across the qubit Φq and the flux across
the oscillator inductor Φ.

resonator capactitor and Φq is the flux through the coupler, as specified in figure Fig. 7(a).
It is convenient to rewrite Eq. (G1) as a sum of three contributions: the qubit, the LCresonator, and their interaction:
Lfg = LLC + Lqubit +

1
Φ Φq ,
L

(G2)

where LLC = 21 C Φ̇2 − Φ2 /(2L), and Lqubit = L0qubit − Φ2q /(2L). Notice that LLC describes an
√
oscillator with resonant frequency ωc = 1/ LC.
In order to deal with an explicit qubit Lagrangian, we consider a fluxonium-type qubit,
such that:
Lqubit

Φq − Φext
= Cq Φ̇2q − Φ2q /(2Lk ) + Ej cos 2π
2
Φ0

!

,

(G3)

where Cq is the qubit capacitance, Lk ' Lc L/(Lc + L), Φ0 = h/2e is the flux quantum, and
Φext is the external flux. The superconducting loop is maximally frustrated at a specific
value of the external flux Φext = Φ0 /2. In this case [53], the atom’s effective potential has
a symmetric double-well shape consisting of two lowest degenerate local minima separated
by approximately the flux quantum Φ0 . This configuration can give rise to artificial atoms
with a high degree of anharmonicity, with the two lowest energy levels well separated by the
higher energy ones. An analogous energy spectrum can also be obtained considering a flux
34

qubit [4].
The momenta conjugate to Φ and Φq can be easily obtained starting from Eq. (G2) by
using the canonical relations
∂L

In this case, Q and Qq represent the charge across the capacitor C of the oscillator, and the
charge across the coupler, respectively.

Hamiltonian can be written as

The quantization procedure of Eq. (G7) is straightforward. In our case, the resonator
operators can be expressed in terms of the creation and annihilation operators as

Q̂ = −iQzpf (â − â† ) ,
where Φzpf =

L~ωc /2, and Qzpf =

C~ωc /2 with ωc = 1/ LC.

q

It is important to note that in Eq. (G9) we implicitly considered all the fluxonium levels.
However, when the energy-level spectrum of the system displays a high degree of anharmonicity, such that the higher energy levels are well spaced with respect to the first two,
35

Eq. (G9) can be projected in a two-level space spanned by the flux-qubit eigenstates |gi
(ground state) and |ei (excited state) using the operator P̂ = |eihe| + |gihg|.
The flux across the coupling inductor can be treated as a constant operator with offdiagonal matrix elements which are directly calculated in the qubit energy eigenbasis as
hg|Φq |ei ' Lc Ip , where Ip is the persistent current in the qubit loop. Performing this
projection, the two-level flux gauge Hamiltonian becomes
Ĥfg = ~ωc â† â +

~ω0
σ̂z + ~ωc η(â† + â)σ̂x ,
2

(G10)

where ~ω0 is the qubit transition energy and ~ωc η = Lc Ip Izpf , where Izpf = Φzpf /L is the
zero-point current fluctuation of the oscillator.
In the flux gauge, the flux across the oscillator inductor is Φ̂L = Φ̂ − Φ̂q . Projecting the
artificial-atom flux Φ̂q in the two-level space, we obtain Φ̂L = Φzpf (â + â† − 2ησ̂x ). The
voltage across the oscillator inductor is

V̂ = Φ̂ = [Φ̂L , Ĥfg ]/(i~) = ωc Φzpf i(â† − â) + 2ηω0 σ̂y .

Charge gauge

In order to derive the charge gauge Hamiltonian of the system ( see Fig. 7(b), we consider
as canonical coordinates the node flux Φq and the flux Φ across the resonator inductance
L. Following the same procedure of the previous subsection, the system Lagrangian can be
written as

(G14)

Also in this case, if the system displays a high degree of anharmonicity, we can project the
system Hamiltonian in the two-level subspace {|gi, |ei}. However, it has been shown that this
truncation ruins gauge invariance [11]. The coupling described in Eq. (G14) is analogous to
the minimal coupling replacement used to introduce the particle-field interaction in quantum
field theory and atomic physics. According to this procedure, the particle momentum is
replaced by the sum of the particle momentum and the product of the charge and the field
coordinate. In the present case, the coupling is introduced by replacing the momentum of
the artificial atom: Q̂q → Q̂q + Q̂. It has been shown that, when the atom Hilbert space
is truncated, unavoidably some degree of spatial nonlocality is introduced in the atomic
potential [11]. As a consequence, the truncated potential will depend also on the momentum
Q̂ and gauge invariance is preserved only by also applying the minimal coupling replacement
to it. To solve this problem, we introduce the minimal coupling replacement by applying a
unitary transformation to the atomic Hamiltonian:
Ĥcg = ĤLC + R̂† Ĥqubit R̂ ,

(G15)

where R̂ = exp(iΦ̂q Q̂/~). It is worth noticing that Eq. (G15) is equivalent to Eq. (G14).
After truncating the atomic space to only two states, the bare qubit Hamiltonian reduces to
Ĥqubit = ~(ω0 /2)σ̂z , The resulting unitary operator in the reduced space is
h

R̂ = exp ησ̂x (â − â† ) ,

(G16)

Ĥcg = ĤLC + R̂† Ĥqubit R̂ .

(G19)

Gauge invariance

The Hamiltonians derived in the previous sections are connected (in full analogy with
the dipole to Coulomb transformation), by a unitary transformation. It results that such
37

unitary operator coincides with R̂ that we used in the previous subsection to implement the
minimal coupling replacement (charge gauge). For example, the flux gauge Hamiltonian can
be obtained starting from Ĥcg by performing the unitary transformation [11]
Ĥfg = R̂Ĥcg R̂† = Ĥqubit + R̂ĤLC R̂† .

(G20)

By using the generalized minimal coupling replacement, described in the previous subsection, gauge invariance holds even after the reduction of the atomic degrees of freedom to
only two levels. Specifically, it results [11]
Ĥfg = R̂Ĥcg R̂† = Ĥqubit + R̂ĤLC R̂† .

(G21)

The inverse transformation from the charge to the flux gauge is straightforward. The
unitary transformation procedure also allows to derive the relationship between the operators
in the different gauges. For example, we can derive the charge gauge operators (labelled with
the ‘prime’ superscript):
σ̂x0 = R̂† σ̂x R̂ = σ̂x

(G22d)

σ̂z0 = cosh 2η(â − â† ) σ̂z + i sinh 2η(â − â† ) σ̂y

It turns out that, in the above equations, the only gauge invariant qubit operator is σ̂x
while the others have to be transformed accordingly to the considered gauge. Finally, we
notice that the oscillator momentum Q̂ = iQzpf (â† − â) is also invariant under the unitary
transformation.

Appendix H: Qubit-oscillator coupling by mutual inductance

We now discuss the qubit-resonator system which is inductively coupled to a LC resonator
via mutual inductance (see Figure 8). In the flux gauge, the Kirchoff equations yield the
Hamiltonian:

the coupling of the LC-resonator with the superconducting artificial atom via the effective

The coupling strength in Eq. (H2) is proportional to the mutual inductance M . When
the energy level spectrum of the superconducting artificial atom displays a high degree of
anharmonicity, such that the higher-energy levels are well spaced with respect to the first two,
39

as in Appendix G10, Eq. (H2) can be projected in a two-level space spanned by the flux-qubit
eigenstates |gi (ground state) and |ei (excited state) using the operator P̂ = |eihe| + |gihg|.
The resulting qubit-oscillator Hamiltonian coincides with Eq. (G10).
It is possible to define a unitary operator in order to perform a transformation from flux
to charge gauge:

In this case we observe that the interaction term is transformed and, instead of involving the
product of the two coordinates, it involves the product of the two momenta. The charge gauge
interaction closely resembles the minimal coupling replacement for natural atoms. However,
it is worth pointing out that in the case of time-dependent interactions [M → M (t)], also
R̂(t) becomes time dependent. As a result, the correct Hamiltonian in the charge gauge is
no more Ĥcg = R̂Ĥfg R̂† , but it becomes:
˙
Ĥcg (t) = R̂(t)Ĥfg (t)R̂† (t) + iR̂R̂† ,

(H5)

which contains additiona terms with respect to Eq. (H4).
It is interesting to compare this result with the corresponding one for natural atoms in
Appendix E (see in particular the discussion in the last paragraph). For natural atoms,
the Hamiltonian resulting from the minimal coupling replacement is the fundamental one
(especially in the presence of time-dependent interactions). However, in the present case,
Ĥcg (which describes the minimal coupling replacement for superconducting circuits) is not
the fundamental Hamiltonian. Here we can adopt an operative definition: the fundamental gauge is the one where the Hamiltonian does not change its structure in the presence
of time-dependent interactions, which actually is Ĥfg (the analogous of the dipole gauge
Hamiltonian).
This difference between circuit QED and cavity QED systems arises from the different
origin of interactions. For natural atoms, the specific form of the interaction is given by
the minimal coupling replacement (the interaction Hamiltonian can be obtained from the
gauge principle applied to the Dirac equation and then taking the nonrelativistic limit).
40

On the other hand, in circuit QED we do not have such a fundamental theory, it is an
effective one which can be derived from the Kirchoff equations. We also notice that these
differences result into a coordinate-momentum interaction Hamiltonian for natural atoms
and into a coordinate-coordinate interaction (which becomes momentum-momentum in the
charge gauge) for superconducting artificial atoms inductively coupled to an oscillator. The
different kind of behaviour of cavity and circuit QED systems after switching off the interaction, shown in the main text [cf. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5], originates from these differences.

Appendix I: Coupling to a transmission line

We now discuss the qubit-resonator system that it is inductively coupled to a transmission
line [cf. Fig. 1(b) in main text]. After discretization, the equivalent circuit for the transmission line (TL) is a set of coupled resonators, each of size ∆x. The properties of the line are
given by the effective impedance. Here, we assume it homogeneous, thus LT = lT ∆x and
CT = cT ∆x are the inductance and capacitance at each site, while lT and cT are those per
unit of length. The mutual inductance is M . See Fig. 9 for a representation of the circuit.

The term in the last line describes the coupling of the LC-resonator with the transmission line
f = (LL − M 2 )/M . We are interested in the situation
via the effective mutual inductance M

where the TL is used for readout, thus the circuit is designed to have M  L. Consequently,
e = L +O(M 2 ) ∼
we can safely approximate the renormalized terms by its bare values L

e = L + O(M 2 ) ∼
and L

fluxes in each capacitor (Qj their canonical charges). Φ is the flux through the capacitor
of the oscillator, and Q the conjugate canonical charge. Finally, Φq is the flux through the
qubit. Notice that this Hamiltonian is written in the flux gauge.

Finally, introducing the position-dependent flux φ(x) for the open transmission line, and
the charge density ρ̂(x) = Q̂j /∆x, the Hamiltonian in the continuum (∆x → 0) reads

This Hamiltonian can be quantized promoting the canonical coordinates to operator and

the starting point for the derivation of the input-output relationship for an LC oscillator
inductively (weakly) coupled to an open transmission line. An analogous interaction term
can be derived for an optical cavity [69].

Appendix J: Input-output theory in the USC regime: LC oscillator coupled to a
transmission line

In the following we assume that g(ω) (with g(ω) = 0 for ω < 0) is a slowly varying
function of frequency, as compared to the line-widths of the system resonances. We also
define ϕ̂ = Φ̂L /Φzpf . Using Eq. (I9), the Heisenberg equation of motion for b̂ω becomes

b̂ω = −iω b̂ω − g(ω) ϕ̂ .

Notice that when the oscillator interacts in the USC regime with a qubit, V̂L+ cannot be

We observe that an analogous input-output theory can be developed for optical cavities
interacting with a matter system in the USC regime [35, 69]. In the presence of systems
interacting quite strongly with thermal reservoirs, this approach can be improved using
ab-initio approaches [70] or introducing quasinormal modes [63].
