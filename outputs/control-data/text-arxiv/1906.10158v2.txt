Abstract
Applied quantum optics stands to revolutionise many aspects of information technology, provided performance can be maintained when scaled up. Silicon quantum photonics satisfies the scaling requirements of miniaturisation and manufacturability,
but at 1.55 µm it suffers from unacceptable linear and nonlinear loss. Here we show that, by translating silicon quantum
photonics to the mid-infrared, a new quantum optics platform is created which can simultaneously maximise manufacturability and miniaturisation, while minimising loss. We demonstrate the necessary platform components: photon-pair generation,
single-photon detection, and high-visibility quantum interference, all at wavelengths beyond 2 µm. Across various regimes,
we observe a maximum net coincidence rate of 448 ± 12 Hz, a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 25.7 ± 1.1, and, a net twophoton quantum interference visibility of 0.993 ± 0.017. Mid-infrared silicon quantum photonics will bring new quantum
applications within reach.

proof-of-concept quantum protocols 25–27 , but to go beyond
a handful of photons, ultra-low optical loss is needed.
Propagation and device losses have steadily fallen 28–32 ,
but two-photon absorption (TPA) is intrinsic. TPA allows
two photons to excite a crystal electron. It is stimulated absorption, growing with optical intensity. TPA clearly limits

The mid-infrared (MIR) is the energy band of vibrations.
The molecular ‘fingerprint’ region, 2–20 µm, is characterised by sharp molecular transitions, which lab-on-chip
sensors can use to spectrally target molecular species in liquid and gaseous analytes 1 . Lidar systems can exploit atmospheric transparency and reduced scintillation in the MIR 2 ,
as well as the high-power handling and reduced phase error of MIR optical phased arrays for improved reliability 3 .
Much work has been done to bring integrated optics to the
MIR, and silicon-on-insulator photonics dominates in the
short-wavelength part of the band (the short-wave infrared),
up to about 4 µm 4–7 . Here, silicon benefits from reduced
two-photon absorption, facilitating nonlinear optical applications 8 : optical parametric oscillators and amplifiers 9 , supercontinuum sources 10,11 , and frequency combs 12,13 have
all been developed.
Full quantum photonic technology has exquisite performance sensitivity, but stands to revolutionise how we measure, communicate, and ultimately process information 18 .
It requires a huge scaling up for either integration or realworld deployment. As classical optics ventures into the
MIR, quantum optics is close behind. Bulk-crystal photonpair sources have been designed 19 ; experiments with one 20 ,
and two 21 MIR photons have been shown, with detection
provided by avalanche photodiodes and up-conversion.
Silicon photonics, operating mainly around the 1.5-µm
telecommunications band, has exploded in scale and functionality 22 , and quantum silicon photonics has grown in tandem 23 . In silicon, quantum-correlated photon pairs are scattered from a bright pump laser via the refractive nonlinearity, by spontaneous four-wave mixing 24 (SFWM). Increasingly large interferometers have used these photons to power

pump power, but it also limits the heralding efficiency of
single photon sources 33 , and so is a fundamental limit to the
large-scale viability of silicon quantum photonics 23 . One
common approach to avoiding TPA is to replace the guiding material (to e.g. silicon nitride 34,35 ). Beyond silicon’s
two-photon band edge, though, around 2.1 µm, two photons carry insufficient energy to excite a crystal electron,
and TPA subsides. A resonant peak in the refractive nonlinearity, here, makes photon-pair sources more efficient,
requiring less pump power. Conventional silica cladding
remains transparent, and environmental black-body noise
is not too large. Linear loss from Rayleigh scattering off
etched waveguide side-walls 36,37 is reduced at long wavelengths, and subwavelength features are more readily manufactured 32,38 . We plot the TPA coefficient βTPA , nonlinear
refractive index n2 , and Rayleigh scattering cross-section,
relative to their 1.55 µm values, in Fig. 1. In this article, we
show that silicon photonics in the 2.1-µm band is one route
to ultra-low-loss quantum optics on a chip.
Any new quantum photonic platform needs: a source of
quantum light, a way to detect that light, and quantum inter-

ference. We report on all three ingredients here. We design
and characterise a silicon waveguide able to generate entangled photon pairs, centred on 2.07 µm, and use classical
nonlinear optics to verify its design. We deploy a new detector system, optimised for the 2-µm band, and verify its
performance. We then drive SFWM in the designed waveguide and observe quantum-correlated photon pairs. Finally,
we embed two such photon-pair sources in a reconfigurable
on-chip interferometer and observe quantum interference.
Waveguide design for MIR SFWM
Spontaneous four-wave mixing, where two pump photons
are scattered to higher and lower frequencies, conserves
energy and momentum. For efficient SFWM, the phasematching condition must be satisfied. The total wave-vector
mismatch, ∆k = ∆klin − 2γP, must be zero. Here, P is the
peak pump power in the waveguide, and γ = k0 n2 /Aeff is the
waveguide nonlinear parameter, with n2 and Aeff the nonlinear refractive index and effective modal area 39 , respectively.
For frequencies near the pump, ∆klin = −β2 ∆ω 2 , where

β2 = d2 k/dω 2 is the waveguide group-velocity dispersion
(GVD), and ∆ω is the pump-photon angular frequency detuning. For efficient four-wave mixing, β2 ≤ 0, i.e. the GVD
must be anomalous or zero.
We designed the waveguide shown in Fig. 2a (510 ×
340 nm2 cross-section, 15◦ side-wall angle) based on the

variations of β2 and Aeff with waveguide width shown in
Fig. 2c, at λ = 2.071 µm. The highly confined fundamental
mode is shown in Fig. 2b. To confirm the phase matching of
our source, and estimate its bandwidth, we measure classical
stimulated four-wave mixing 9,40 . Figure 2f shows a spectral
map of the pump and stimulated emission, for various seed
3

laser wavelengths. We observe phase-matched four-wave
mixing over at least 60 nm, limited by grating coupler transmission, implying a very wide SFWM spectrum (Fig. 2e).
All previous measurements of silicon’s 2.1-µm optical
nonlinearity have been in bulk samples: here we confirm
that the high nonlinear figure of merit measured in bulk
also exists in nanoscale silicon waveguides. We use selfphase modulation and the Gerchberg-Saxton optical phaseretrieval method to estimate the waveguide nonlinearity 16 ;
our results are summarised in Fig. 2d with methods detailed
in Supplementary Section S2. We find an effective waveguide nonlinearity of γ = 203 ± 26 W−1 m−1 (n2 = 15.3 ±
1.9 × 10−18 m2 W−1 in bulk) and waveguide nonlinear absorption coefficient αTPA = 24.4 ± 3.3 W−1 m−1 (βTPA =
0.557 ± 0.07 cm · GW−1 in bulk). Here, αTPA = ∂ α/∂ P and
βTPA = ∂ α/∂ I, where α is the waveguide loss coefficient,
and the intensity I = P/Aeff for a waveguided power P with
calculated Aeff = 0.228 µm2 . Our measurements on waveguides are in agreement with those in bulk 14,15 (see Fig. 1).
With the resonant n2 enhancement, less pump is required for
the same SFWM rate, and so less TPA ultimately results (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). This is in addition to the modest
reduction in βTPA which we observe.

we find that the SDE of the two detectors plateaus with bias
currents around 8 µA, with peak SDE values of 44 ± 10%
and 48±10%, for detectors A and B, respectively. In the following experiments, we operate with detector bias currents
of 7.9 µA and 8.1 µA. We measure a timing jitter of 216 ps
(full width at half maximum) from photon cross-correlation.
The dark count rate and efficiency as a function of bias at
λ = 2.071 µm is shown in Figs. 3c and 3d. We use an attenuated tuneable laser to measure the SDE as a function of
wavelength, and plot the results in Fig. 3e.
Photon pairs are detected in coincidence, with detector
output pulses time correlated using standard coincidence
counting logic. We observe a characteristic peak at zero
relative delay from photons produced in the same SFWM
event. A representative histogram is shown in Fig. 3f. We
varied the launched optical power, fit each time correlation
histogram with a Gaussian function, and integrated over
3 standard deviations (389 ps). These data are plotted in
Fig. 3g. At low pump powers, we estimate an on-chip
per-pulse generation efficiency of 11 MHz/W2 , for watts
of peak power, which at the repetition rate of our laser
gives a generation probability of 0.28/W2 (peak). These
estimated on-chip rates naturally exclude loss (see Methods). We measure a maximum net coincidence rate of
112±3 Hz, with peak coincidence to accidental ratio (CAR)
of 25.7 ± 1.1, at a coincidence rate of 1.1 Hz. We define
CAR = (Xraw − Xacc )/Xacc , where Xraw is the integrated coincidence count in the histogram central peak, and Xacc is the
average integrated coincidence count in the side (accidental)
peaks (see Supplementary Section S4 and Fig. S4 for singles
rates). Dark counts limit the maximum CAR ∝ η/DCR,
so higher system transmission (η) and lower DCR will offer further improvements to the CAR. On a longer 17.5mm waveguide, we measured a peak net coincidence rate
of 224 Hz (Supplementary Fig. S2c). Due to the simple separation of the signal and idler with a beam splitter, the actual
pair-production rates are 4× the measured net rates. Thus,
we observe true rates of 448 Hz and 896 Hz for the two
waveguides, respectively (see Supplementary Section S4).

Observation of correlated photon pairs
For a bright source of quantum-correlated photon pairs,
we use SFWM. We start with a picosecond-pulsed pump
laser, centred at 2.0715 µm, which we filter to a width of
1.0 nm using a double-pass grating monochromator. Controlling polarisation, we inject this pump into the fundamental TE mode of the waveguide with a vertical grating coupler (VGC; −7.3 dB transmission). The waveguide, shown
in Fig. 3a, is wrapped into a 7.2-mm square spiral (3.2
dB/cm propagation loss) with 10-µm minimum radius Euler
bends 41 . Signal and idler photons are emitted in the same
spatial mode, coupled off-chip, and separated probabilistically by a 1:1 fibre beam splitter. Both channels are tightly
filtered with back-to-back free-space grating monochromators (∼4.5 dB insertion loss per monochromator) to achieve
the required > 100 dB pump rejection 42,43 . The signal and
idler filters are 1.0-nm wide, and separated from the pump
by ± 1.46 THz (20.8 nm). The experimental scheme is
shown in Fig. 3b.
To detect single photons from SFWM, sensitive detectors are necessary. Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD) have unrivalled timing jitter, dark
count rates (DCR), and system detection efficiency (SDE),
and have shown sensitivity up to 5 µm 44 . We incorporate
superconducting nanowires into a dielectric stack optimised
for absorption into the nanowire cavity at λ = 2.1 µm. The
SNSPDs were fabricated from a 4-nm thick niobium nitride
film, deposited using magnetron sputtering, and patterned
using electron-beam lithography into a meander of 100-nmwide superconducting wire. The nanowires are fibre coupled with anti-reflection coated SM2000 fibre. A second
SM2000-fibre span connects these detectors to our optical
apparatus (∼ 30 m; 1.49 dB and 1.63 dB loss per channel,
for detectors A and B respectively). Operating at 780 mK,

On-chip quantum interference
The indistinguishability of generated photons, confirmed by
high-visibility quantum interference between them, is an essential platform resource. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect causes two indistinguishable single photons to strictly
bunch at the outputs of a balanced beam splitter 45 . Here,
we demonstrate on-chip quantum interference using a timereversed HOM experiment 46 , with experimental setup and
waveguide circuit shown in Figs. 4a and 4b.
After filtering the pump as before, we couple it onto the
chip through a VGC. We set the on-chip peak pump power
to 0.32 W, corresponding to a CAR of 19.3 and ∼ 0.03
pairs per pulse. The pump field is equally split between
the two photon-pair sources, with a balanced 1 × 2 multimode interference (MMI) coupler. Both 7.39-mm sources
are coherently pumped and the relative phase φ between
the two arms is varied with a thermo-optic phase modulator (see Supplementary Section S1 for details of integrated

Discussion and conclusions

(1)

Despite operating in the 2-µm band, we see from Fig. 2d
that two-photon absorption remains, albeit reduced from its
strength at 1.55 µm. This is to be expected at room temperature and at λ = 2.07 µm, as silicon’s indirect band gap gives
a TPA cut-off around 2.21 µm (Fig. 1). Our waveguided estimates of both nonlinear absorption and refraction are in
broad agreement with literature values for bulk silicon 14,15 .
At low temperatures, a blue-shift in the band edge causes a
blue-shift in the TPA cut-off 52 , to 2.15 µm. Future roomtemperature experiments will benefit from 2.2-µm laser development (e.g. semiconductor disk lasers 53 ), while experiments integrating SNSPDs on-chip or in-package will benefit from this low-temperature shift of the TPA cut off.
Black-body radiation from our room-temperature apparatus was a source of noise in our measurements. As seen
in Figs. 3c and 3d, the ‘dark’ count rate, collected with
the lights and laser turned off, plateaus, rather than growing exponentially with bias, because environmental black-

chip, we reject the pump laser, and use coincidence detection to estimate | h1s 0i |A h0s 1i |B |ψi |2 .
We observe characteristic half-period interference
fringes in the coincidences 46,47 , as the on-chip phase φ is
varied, consistent with Eq. 1 (see Fig. 4c). This quantum
interference has a net visibility of V = 0.993 ± 0.017
(with 0.862 ± 0.014 raw). We calculate the visibility
as V = (Xmax − Xmin )/(Xmax + Xmin ), where Xmax and
Xmin are the maximum and minimum coincidence count
rates of the sinusoidal fit. This compares favourably
to performance at 1.55 µm on chip 46,48–50 , and at 2.1
µm in bulk 51 . We observe coincidence rates of up to
5

body photons nonetheless illuminate the detectors (see Supplementary Figs. S3a,b). Black-body noise would be suppressed by a cold filter. Both CAR and raw fringe visibility
would benefit from such a filter.
In demonstrating a bright source of photon pairs, efficient
single-photon detectors, and high-visibility quantum interference, we have provided all the necessary ingredients for a
dense, manufacturable, and high-performance platform for
applied quantum optics. The mid-infrared presents a new
approach to scalable optical quantum information processing in silicon.

Phase retrieval In the waveguide nonlinearity measurements, the transmitted power and spectrum of our passively mode-locked Ho-doped fibre pulsed laser (AdValue photonics) were taken 16 . Firstly, the pump
input pulses are filtered with a single pass monochromator centred at
λ = 2.0715 µm. The pulses in the time domain are characterised by taking
an intensity autocorrelation (Femtochrome FR-103PD) and fitted with a hyperbolic secant-squared ansatz giving an input pulse duration of τ = 4.82 ps
(see Supplementary Section S2 for more detail). The laser is then connected to the 17.5 − mm spiral with an 9:1 optical tap to monitor the input power. The optical power launched into the chip is controlled with
a knife edge variable optical attenuator, allowing the intensity-dependent
transmission and spectrum of the output pulse to be measured. For each
power launched, a frequency spectrum is recorded on an OSA (Yokogawa
AQ6375) at the chip output.
To retrieve nonlinear phase from the output spectrum, sequential
Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms are performed to transform between
the time and frequency domains (Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm 55 ). By retaining the phase information, but replacing the amplitude with our measured secant-pulse envelope (time domain) or power spectrum (frequency
domain), the algorithm is found to converge on a steady state. Using this algorithm the nonlinear phase corresponding to the measured spectral broadening is retrieved for each pulse. Finally, the phase profiles are fitted with
a secant-shaped phase model and combining this with the free carrier dispersion and absorption effects found from fitting the transmission data, the
nonlinear phase and hence the waveguide nonlinearity are found. To determine the value of n2 in Fig. 1, we calculated the effective modal area using
the method from 39 . In addition to determining the refractive nonlinearity,
the transmitted power is also used to determine the TPA parameter by using a fit to the inverse transmission against the input power, as described in
Ref. 56.
Stimulated four-wave mixing We pump the waveguide source with a
filtered picosecond pulsed laser centred at λ = 2.0715 µm and a tuneable
continuous wave (CW) laser (Sacher Lion) as the stimulating field. The
two lasers are combined on a 1:1 fibre beam splitter before the chip with
power monitoring optical taps to normalise the stimulated FWM at the chip
output. Tuning the frequency of the CW laser, the stimulated FWM from a
7.2-mm spiral is measured on an OSA.
Detector characterisation Electrical output traces of the RF pulses
from the SNSPDs are recorded for several bias settings. The peak voltage of the pulse changes linearly as a function of detector bias and a linear
model is fit to this data: 7.46 and 10.84 mVµA−1 for detectors A and B,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3). This is combined with a constant
offset of 15 and 20 mV, determining the discrimination voltage as a function of bias for detectors A and B, respectively. Detectors A and B are
connected internally to cryostat ports D4 and D3, respectively.
The transmission of a tuneable CW laser (Sacher Lion) centred at λ =
2.07 µm is measured with a InGaAs photodiode (Thorlabs S148C) at a
fibre just before the cryostat to calibrate out any fibre losses between the
source and the detectors. A motorised knife edge attenuator is then used
to calibrate the knife edge position as a function of transmitted power at
the photodiode. Individual transmission of four neutral density filters are
then recorded before inserting them in the beam path and reducing the net
photon flux down to the single photon regime.
Finally, the photodiode input fibre is connected to the superconducting
detector, and singles counts from a Picoquant PicoHarp timetagger are integrated for 0.5 s for each optical power launched. The estimated input
and output photon flux is fit with a linear slope model and is used to determine the system detection efficiency (see Supplementary Section 3 for
error analysis).

Methods
Dispersion calculation Finite difference eigenmode simulations were
performed to determine the optimal waveguide geometry 54 . The waveguide height was fixed to 340 nm, with a 15◦ sidewall angle. The dispersion
was calculated with a fractional frequency offset of 0.0001 to obtain the
group velocity dispersion for the fundamental transverse electric mode at a
centre wavelength of λ = 2.071 µm. A waveguide with a cross-sectional
area of 510 × 340 nm2 simultaneously achieves anomalous group-velocity
dispersion (β2 ≤ 0) required for phase matching, while minimising the effective modal area, see Fig. 2c.

Correlated photon pair measurement We pump the waveguide source
shown in Fig. 3a with a passively mode-locked Ho-doped fibre pulsed laser
(AdValue Photonics) centred on 2.0715 µm, producing 2.9-ps pulses, at
a 39.4-MHz repetition rate, with 487 W of peak power coupled into fibre
from free space. The laser is filtered with a monochromator in a doublepass configuration (Fig. 3b), producing 5.78-ps pulses, with 24.4-W peak

Device fabrication The device in this report was a 340 nm crystalline
silicon(100)-oriented silicon-on-insulator platform, with a 2 µm buried oxide and LPCVD SiO2 1 µm top cladding. The silicon structures were

power. Filtered pump is then coupled into the waveguide with a V-groove
array and vertical grating couplers. After propagating through the waveguide spiral, the signal and idler photons are passively demultiplexed on
a fibre beam splitter. Back-to-back single-pass monochromators suppress
the pump. Finally, the photon pairs are detected by our SNSPDs. A timeinterval analyser (PicoQuant PicoHarp) with a 4-ps resolution correlates
detector output pulses. For each power launched, a histogram was integrated for 540 and 180 seconds, in the low and high power regimes, respectively. Each integration was subdivided into 20-second intervals.
At low pump powers, nonlinear absorption and dispersion play a reduced role, greatly simplifying our model, and allowing us to unambiguously estimate a source efficiency, exclusive of channel losses 57 . In the
low-power regime, SFWM simply scales with P2 , where P is the peak
pump power. Here, we consider P < 0.5 W to be ‘low power’. We estimated the on-chip pair-generation efficiency and probability by analysing
the pair-generation versus pump-power data of Fig. 3g (net coincidences,
X) and Supplementary Fig. S4 (singles of each channel, C0 , C1 ). All three
datasets were fit with a polynomial of the form aP2 + bP + c, though with
b = c = 0 for the net coincidences data (as accidentals are already subtracted). The on-chip rate per unit peak-power-squared is then estimated as
aC0 aC1 /aX , where a∗ is the best fit parameter a for the indicated dataset.
This efficiency is converted to probability by dividing by the laser repetition rate, and converted to average power by dividing by the square of the
effective duty cycle (about 2.6 × 10−4 for our filtered laser).
Thermo-optic phase modulator calibration We used a 16-bit DC voltage source (Qontrol Systems) to drive the on-chip thermo-optic phase modulators. Injecting CW laser light centred on λ = 2.049 µm (Eblana photonics quantum cascade laser) into the input vertical grating coupler, the
optical output of the chip was monitored with a photodiode while the
phase-voltage was varied, see Supplementary Fig. S1. The interferometers voltage-squared versus transmission was fit with a sinusoidal envelope.
In the time-reversed HOM experiment, 30 evenly spaced squared-voltages
were set on the source interferometer phase shifter.
