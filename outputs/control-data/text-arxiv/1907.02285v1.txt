In the two-particle approximation, we consider the mechanism for the formation of an ordered arrangement of
transparent spherical particles of small size in a concentration grating excited by the gradient force of counterpropagating Gaussian laser beams. This mechanism is due to the joint action of the transverse gradient force
and the Coulomb force arising as a result of dipole-dipole interactions between particles.

It is known [1–4] that a liquid suspension of transparent
particles of small size is a highly efficient nonlinear optical
heterogeneous medium for continuous laser radiation. For example, as reported in Ref. [1], the optical Kerr coefficient n2
of the water suspension of latex spherical particles with radius
R = 0.117 µm and concentration N = 6.5 · 1010 cm−3 turned
out to be 105 times higher than in CS2 . For the first time,
the possibility of using such heterogeneous media as a nonlinear optical material was noted in Ref. [5]. Nonlinear optical phenomena in such artificially created media, in particular,
four-wave mixing [1–3] and stimulated concentration scattering [6, 7], are caused by energy exchange processes between
the waves interacting on the concentration gratings excited by
them due to the gradient component of the light pressure force.
In Refs. [8–10], the concentration gratings were recorded
in an aqueous suspension of polystyrene particles with R =
0.7−3 µm with the interference field of continuous lasers. An
interesting experiment on the excitation of a two-dimensional
concentration grating (matrix) of polystyrene particles with
R = 150 − 300 nm in water under the influence of orthogonal
pairs of interfering beams of continuous laser radiation was
performed in Ref. [11]. The results obtained in [11] open
up the prospects of synthesizing crystal matrices that demonstrate all the characteristics of ordinary molecular crystals and
are of interest for various scientific and practical applications.
In the experiments on excitation of concentration gratings
by coherent beams of a He-Ne laser, an ordered arrangement
of particles along its lines was observed [9, 10]. Particles “collected” under the action of the longitudinal component of the

approximately equal distances from each other (see Fig. 1).

is considered resulting in the stable arrangement of the particles in the concentration grating with a certain distance between them. Analysis of the spatial distribution of particles
under the action of these forces in the general case is a very
complex many-body problem. Nevertheless, even consideration of two particles gives an idea about the mechanism of
their ordered arrangement in the concentration grating and allows one to draw certain conclusions and numerical estimates.
Although we focus on the Gaussian beams in our consideration, one can find in the literature the other realizations of
optical forces using, e.g., the Airy beams [12, 13].
Let us consider a mechanism leading to an ordered arrangement of transparent spherical particles of small sizes in the
concentration grating excited by linearly polarized Gaussian
beams oppositely propagating along the z axis. In this case,
the total amplitude of the field can be represented as

To simplify calculations, we assume that the first particle
is located at the beams center (r = 0), whereas the second
particle is in the arbitrary point r (see Fig. 2). Since these
coordinates correspond to the particles centers, then r & d.
Using the geometrical scheme shown in Fig. 2 and the results
of Ref. [14], one can obtain for our case the expressions for

Obviously, the distance r p does not depend on the radiation
intensity. It is determined by the polarizability and particle
size as well as the radius of laser beams. In particular, for
r p  r0 and (d/r p )2  1, we find from Eq. (10) that
q
r p ≈ 5 6α0 (r0 /n)2 .
(11)
For example, for polystyrene particles with R = 100 nm in
water (n = 1.33, α0 = 0.12) and beams radius r0 = 4 · 10−2
mm, we obtain r p ≈ 0.9 · 10−3 mm. At the same time, both
inequalities determining the range of applicability of Eq. (11)
are satisfied. With an increase in the particle radius by 2 times,
the distance r p increases by about 1.5 times.
In conclusion, we note that in the experiments [9, 10], the
small-particle approximation (kR  1) used here is not fulfilled and, accordingly, the formalism of the Maxwell stress
tensor [15] must be used to calculate the gradient force. This
approach allows us to calculate the gradient force in the case
of particles of arbitrary radius [16]. However, such calculations are very time consuming and require numerical simulations. For this brief report, which explains only the mechanism of the ordered arrangement of particles in the concentration gratings, these cumbersome calculations are not given

here. We also note that when a concentration grating is excited by plane waves, the arrangement of the particles in its
lines will be determined by the Coulomb forces of the dipoledipole interaction and the transverse dimensions of the cell
containing the suspension. The considered mechanism based

on competition of the gradient force and dipole-dipole interaction should be taken into account upon creation of molecularcrystal-like structures [11] from liquid suspensions of small
particles with the optical methods.
