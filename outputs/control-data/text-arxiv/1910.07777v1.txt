Internal tides and near-inertial internal waves in the ocean are well-recognized to play an
important role in the global energy budget. Triadic resonance is one mechanism via which
these internal waves dissipate their energy, often at locations away from their generation
sites. In this paper, we perform a combined theoretical and numerical study of triadic
resonance in internal wave modes in a finite-depth ocean with background rotation and
an arbitrary stratification profile. The spatial evolution of the modal amplitudes within
a resonant triad are first derived based on the requirement that the nonlinear solution
at leading order cannot diverge. The amplitude evolution equations are then numerically
solved for two different cases: (i) modes 1 and 2 at a specific frequency (ω0 ) in triadic
resonance with the mode-1 superharmonic wave (frequency 2ω0 ) in a uniform stratification, and (ii) a self-interacting mode-3 at a specific frequency ω0 in triadic resonance with
the mode-2 at frequency 2ω0 in a nonuniform stratification representative of the ocean.
Quantitative estimates of energy transfer rates within the resonant triad show that superharmonic wave generation resulting from modal interactions should be an important
consideration alongside other triadic resonances like parametric subharmonic instability (PSI). Remarkably, in case (ii), the amplitude evolution equations suggest that any
initial energy in mode-3 at frequency ω0 would get permanently transferred to mode-2
at frequency 2ω0 . Direct numerical simulations are then performed to show the spontaneous generation of superharmonic internal waves resulting from modal interactions in
the aforementioned two cases, and quantitatively validate the initial spatial evolution of
the wave field predicted by the amplitude evolution equations. Furthermore, direct numerical simulations at off-resonant frequencies are used to identify the range of primary
wave frequencies (around the resonant frequency) over which spontaneous superharmonic
wave generation occurs. We conclude by giving estimates of the relative importance of
superharmonic wave generation in the ocean, and provide motivation for future studies.

1. Introduction
Mechanisms that drive internal wave dissipation in the ocean are of paramount importance in understanding the global energy budget, the state of the ocean & its spatiotemporal variability, and in improving the parametrization of internal wave driven mixing in general circulation models (Garrett & Munk 1979; Munk & Wunsch 1998; Garrett

Figure 1. Schematic showing the generation of internal wave beams by barotropic forcing (at
frequency ω0 ) acting on a model ocean floor topography. The nonlinear spatial evolution of the
internal wave beams, which are represented as a superposition of linear internal wave modes
away from the topography, is the subject of the current study. The generation, and subsequent
growth, of a superharmonic 2ω0 internal wave mode-p as a result of its resonant interaction with
modes m & n at frequency ω0 are indicated (not drawn to scale) in the region to the right of the
topography. A nonuniform stratification N (z) with a pycnocline, representative of the ocean,
is shown on the left. The ratio between the maximum stratification Nmax and the deep ocean
value N0 is unity for a uniformly stratified ocean.

2003; Alford et al. 2016). It is now well-established that a significant amount of energy is put into internal tides (Egbert & Ray 2000) and near-inertial motions (Alford
2003a), which often propagate quite large distances both horizontally and vertically
(Alford 2003b; Rainville & Pinkel 2006; Alford et al. 2016). While internal tides are generated by barotropic forcing over ocean floor topography (Garrett & Kunze 2007), nearinertial internal waves are generated by winds acting on the ocean surface (Pollard 1970;
Alford et al. 2016). In this paper, we focus on one mechanism by which energy could
be transferred from these internal tides or near-inertial internal waves into higher frequencies and other spatial scales, and potentially lead towards internal wave dissipation.
Specifically, we study the generation of superharmonic internal waves resulting from a
resonant interaction between internal wave modes.
Internal tide generation by barotropic forcing over continental shelves or deep ocean
topography often occur in the form of internal wave beams (Garrett & Kunze 2007), i.e.
a distribution of the overall energy into a series of vertical modes at the tidal frequency
in the finite depth ocean. As shown in the schematic in figure 1, one of the goals of the
current study is to highlight the importance of superharmonic internal wave generation
due to resonant or near-resonant interaction between these modes at the tidal frequency.
In a similar vein, the near-inertial internal wave field around their generation region can
be represented as a summation over vertical modes at near-inertial frequencies (Gill 1984;
Van der Lee & Umlauf 2011; Alford et al. 2016).
Triadic resonance (LeBlond & Mysak 1981) is considered to be an important mechanism by which internal wave energy at a given frequency gets transferred to smaller
spatial scales and other frequencies. For plane internal waves in a uniform stratification,
the classical conditions of ω1 ± ω2 ± ω3 = 0 and k1 + k2 + k3 = 0 are necessary to
be satisfied by the wave components in a resonant triad. Here, ωi (> 0) and ki are the

Spontaneous superharmonic internal wave generation by modal interactions

frequency and wave vector of the ith wave in the resonant triad. Previous theoretical
studies (Klostermeyer 1991; Sonmor & Klaassen 1997) have even argued that resonant
triad interactions are the basic mechanism behind every instability in a plane internal
wave. A more recent theoretical study has also shown that several instabilities in a plane
internal wave are related to triadic resonances at various orders (Ghaemsaidi & Mathur
2019). An often-studied manifestation of these resonant triads is in the form of a primary
wave forced at frequency ω0 generating two daughter waves at subharmonic frequencies
(ω1 , ω2 < ω0 ) - we refer to such resonant triads as subharmonic resonant triads in the rest
of this paper. In the limit of ω1 ≈ ω2 ≈ ω0 /2, the generation of the subharmonic daughter
waves is referred to as parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) (Staquet & Sommeria
2002).
Numerical simulations (Koudella & Staquet 2006) and laboratory experiments (Bourget et al.
2013) have revealed the occurrence of subharmonic triadic resonance in plane internal
waves, with both studies reporting comparisons with theoretical growth rates. The theoretical growth rates for plane internal waves in a uniform stratification are based on amplitude evolution equations derived using the method of multiple scales (Bourget et al.
2013; Richet et al. 2018). Subharmonic resonant triads, and thier associated amplitude
evolution have also been studied in internal wave beams in an unbounded uniform stratification (Karimi & Akylas 2014; Bourget et al. 2014; Dauxois et al. 2018). Furthermore,
Karimi & Akylas (2017) have investigated subharmonic triadic resonance in internal wave
beams at twice the inertial frequency associated with the background rotation, again in
an unbounded uniform stratification. In ocean-like nonuniform stratifications, the interaction between an internal wave beam and the pycnocline has also been reported to result
in subharmonic triadic resonance (Gayen & Sarkar 2013). Recently, Saranraj & Guha
(2019) used the method of multiple scales to derive the amplitude evolution equations
for a resonant triad comprising internal wave packets in an unbounded weakly nonuniform
stratifications with no background rotation.
With respect to internal wave modes, Varma & Mathur (2017) have theoretically
shown the existence of resonant triads comprising two modes at a given frequency ω0
and a third mode at the superharmonic frequency 2ω0 in uniform and nonuniform stratifications with background rotation. They further showed that ocean-like nonuniform
stratifications containing a pycnocline support several more such resonant triads than a
uniform stratification. Varma & Mathur (2017), however, did not attempt to calculate
the intra energy transfer rates within these resonant triads, which could be obtained
by deriving the amplitude evolution equations. Previous studies have considered the
temporal evolution of the wave amplitudes in resonant triads comprising internal wave
modes in a uniform stratification with no background rotation, and have shown in laboratory experiments that complex wave fields containing different resonant triads emerge
when individual standing modes of sufficiently strong amplitude are forced (Thorpe 1966;
McEwan 1971; Martin et al. 1972; McEwan et al. 1972; Benielli & Sommeria 1998).
Liang et al. (2017) used the amplitude evolution equations for resonant triads comprising internal wave modes in a uniform stratification with no background rotation to
show that PSI (daughter waves at half the primary wave frequency) does not necessarily
represent the most unstable resonant triad that comprises a primary wave at frequency
ω0 and two daughter waves at frequencies smaller than ω0 . The subharmonic waves generated in an experimental study of a mode-1 internal wave in a uniform stratification
also indicate that PSI with daughter waves at ω0 /2 is not necessarily the most unstable
resonant triad (Joubaud et al. 2012). In the presence of background rotation, the numerical study of MacKinnon & Winters (2005) has shown the occurrence of PSI in mode-1
at twice the inertial frequency in a uniform stratification. The amplitude evolution for

4

Varma et. al.

PSI in mode-1 at twice the inertial frequency in an ocean-like nonuniform stratification
has been investigated by Young et al. (2008). A recent numerical study by Richet et al.
(2018) has studied a similar problem in more detail, focusing on both the regimes of
proapagation and evanescence for the daughter waves at the inertial frequency.
Sutherland (2016) performed numerical simulations to show that individual modes in
a nonuniform stratification can generate superharmonic disturbances. These superharmonic disturbances were not necessarily internal waves, and the focus of their study
was not triadic resonance; rather, they provide a superharmonic generation mechanism
based on weakly nonlinear interactions. Furthermore, the steady-state weakly nonlinear
solution at the superharmonic frequency resulting from the non-resonant self-interaction
of an isolated mode in ocean-like model nonuniform stratifications (Varma & Mathur
2017; Wunsch 2017) suggest that the generation of superharmonic disturbances could be
an important factor in the ocean. In this paper, we study the generation of superharmonic internal waves by resonant interaction between primary internal wave mode(s) at
frequency ω0 in uniform and nonuniform stratifications with background rotation. Typically, in subharmonic triadic resonance, a finite amount of energy is put into a single
primary wave, while the two subharmonic daughter waves have negligible energy to begin with. In contrast, our study concerns a superharmonic resonant triad, with the two
primary waves at frequency ω0 containing a finite amount of initial energy, and hence
potentially resulting in rapid growth of the single superharmonic daughter wave. The
schematic in figure 1 depicts energy injection into two primary waves at tidal frequency
by barotropic forcing on bottom topography, and the resulting spatial growth of a superharmonic internal wave.
The main goals of this study are: (i) derivation of amplitude evolution equations for any
resonant triad comprising internal wave modes in an arbitrary stratification profile with
background rotation, (ii) highlight the significance of superharmonic wave generation as
a result of resonant interaction between modes at a specific frequency, and (iii) perform
direct numerical simulations (DNS) to validate the amplitude evolution equations, and
investigate the superharmonic wave generation at off-resonant frequencies The rest of the
paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the derivation of the amplitude evolution
equations. In section 3, we present the details of DNS, and also motivate the specific cases
we study numerically. Section 3 also includes a description of the post-processing of the
flow fields obtained from DNS. Section 4 presents our theoretical and DNS results, which
are then summarized in the beginning of section 5. We conclude by highlighting the
relative importance of our results, and also discuss the scope for future studies.

where x, z are the horizontal and vertical spatial coordinates, respectively, and t is
time. ψ(x, z, t), v(x, z, t) and ρ(x, z, t) are the stream function, y−component of velocity and density, respectively, with the velocity components in the xz-plane given by
(u, w) = (−∂ψ/∂z, ∂ψ/∂x). ρ̄ is a reference constant density, f the Coriolis frequency
and g = −gêz (g > 0) the acceleration due to gravity (êz is the unit vector along the
positive z−axis). The Jacobian operator J is defined as J(A, B) = (∂A/∂x)(∂B/∂z) −
(∂B/∂x)(∂A/∂z), and ∇2 = ∂ 2 /∂x2 + ∂ 2 /∂z 2 . The no-normal flow boundary condition
at the horizontal boundaries of the fluid of depth H is specified as ψ(x, z = 0, t) =
ψ(x, z = H, t) = 0, where the ocean floor at z = 0 is assumed flat and the free surface at
z = H is modelled as a rigid lid.
In the framework of regular perturbation expansion, we seek solutions to equations
(2.1)-(2.3) of the form
(ψ, v, ρ) = (ψ0 , v0 , ρ0 ) + ǫ(ψ1 , v1 , ρ1 ) + ǫ2 (ψ2 , v2 , ρ2 ) + · · · ,

(2.4)

where the small parameter ǫ quantifies the relative magnitude of the nonlinear terms in
the governing equations. The quiescent stably stratified background
state is described by
Rz
the solution at O(ǫ0 ): ψ0 = 0, v0 = 0, ρ0 (z) = ρ̄ − (ρ̄/g) 0 N 2 (z)dz, where N (z) is the
vertical profile of the buoyancy frequency.
We assume the existence of a slow horizontal coordinate X = ǫx over which internal
wave amplitudes at O(ǫ) vary. Following the classical method of multiple scales (Nayfeh
2008), the horizontal spatial derivatives in the governing equations (2.1)-(2.3) are written

While it is common in the literature (Bourget et al. 2013; Richet et al. 2018) to consider
slow temporal evolution of the wave amplitudes in a resonant triad, our assumption of
a wave field with slow spatial evolution for the amplitudes is better suited to describe
scenarios like in figure 1, where constant-amplitude primary waves at a fixed frequency
are continuously forced at the fixed location of the generation site.
Substituting the solution forms in equation (2.4) into equations (2.1)-(2.3), and using
equations (2.5)-(2.6), the governing equations at O(ǫ0 ), O(ǫ1 ) and O(ǫ2 ) are obtained
as shown in equations
(A 1)-(A 3) of appendix A. Substituting ψ0 = 0, v0 = 0 and
Rz
ρ0 (z) = ρ̄ − (ρ̄/g) 0 N 2 (z)dz, the governing equations at O(ǫ1 ) reduce to

where the superscript ∗ denotes complex conjugate. The frequencies (assumed real &
positive) and horizontal wavenumbers (assumed real) satisfy the triadic resonance conditions: ω1 + ω2 = ω3 and k1 + k2 = k3 (LeBlond & Mysak 1981). The real vertical mode
shapes φj (z) satisfy

(2.13)

along with the boundary conditions φj (z = 0) = φj (z = H) = 0. Additionally, for triadic
resonance, the mode shapes are required to satisfy a non-orthogonality condition similar
to what is derived in Varma & Mathur (2017) for the special case of ω1 = ω2 . This
additional condition for the vertical mode shapes causes the non-existence of a steadystate (with non-zero amplitudes for all the three waves in the resonant triad) for the
amplitude evolution equations we derive in this subsection. For a uniform stratification,
it is equivalent to the requirement that the mode numbers mj associated with φj (z)
satisfy m3 = |m2 − m1 |. In contrast, in a non-uniform stratification, the conditions
k1 + k2 = k3 and ω1 + ω2 = ω3 are likely sufficient to ensure that the additional condition
on the vertical mode shapes required for triadic resonance is satisfied (Varma & Mathur
2017). Substituting equations (2.10)-(2.12) in equations (2.8)-(2.9) gives the following

corresponding to unit energy flux in the j th internal wave if |Ψj | = 1. In other words,
|Ψj |2 is the energy flux in the j th wave of the resonant triad.
In the ocean, internal tide generation and/or scattering at the bottom topography
excite at least a few internal wave modes at the tidal frequency, with a significant fraction
of the total energy being in the low modes. In the current study, this low-mode internal
wave field is assumed to contain one or two of the three internal waves in the resonant
triad we consider in equations (2.10) - (2.12). For example, two modes at the semidiurnal
frequency could represent the primary waves, and they could be in triadic resonance with

Spontaneous superharmonic internal wave generation by modal interactions

a superharmonic secondary wave (Varma & Mathur 2017). Alternately, one mode at the
semidiurnal frequency could be the primary wave, which is in triadic resonance with two
secondary waves at subharmonic frequencies. The relative importance of these various
resonant triads which comprise one or two of the waves in the existing linear internal
wave field is the focus of our current study.

two additional terms corresponding to p = q = 1 and p = q = 2 in equation (2.18) will

governing equation (2.13) for the mode shapes φj (z), but now with a non-zero forcing
term Cj (z) on the right hand side. In other words, φj (z) represents the homogeneous
solution to equation (2.27).
The particular solution to equation (2.27) would diverge unless the orthogonality condition

where sgn(ki ) represents the sign of ki and hence the direction of propagation of the ith
wave.
It is noteworthy that α1 , α2 and α3 are non-zero since the three waves in ψ1 (equation
2.10) form a resonant triad. Specifically, Varma & Mathur (2017) showed that three
constant amplitude waves (i.e. no spatial dependence for Ψ1 , Ψ2 and Ψ3 ) with their
frequencies and horizontal wavenumbers satisfying ω1 + ω2 = ω3 and k1 + k2 = k3
represent a resonant triad only if α1 , α2 and α3 are non-zero. In the current study, the
weak spatial dependence (i.e variatian in X) in the amplitudes Ψ1 , Ψ2 and Ψ3 are such
that diverging steady-state solutions due to triadic resonance (Varma & Mathur 2017) is
avoided. In the case of a self-interacting mode in triadic resonance with a superharmonic
mode, α3 is twice the value given by the expression in equation (2.34), owing to the
additional terms shown in equation (2.25). Additionally, for self-interaction, we prescribe
Ψ1 = Ψ2 , ω1 = ω2 , k1 = k2 and φ1 = φ2 , where 2Ψ1 represents the streamfunction
amplitude of the self-interacting mode.
2.2. Off-resonance steady state solutions
Weakly nonlinear steady-state solutions resulting from an interaction between modes m
& n at frequency ω0 in the linear wave field were studied by Varma & Mathur (2017). In
this framework, the wave field at order ǫ1 is written as:
ψ1 = Ψ1 φ1 (z) cos(k1 x − ω0 t + γ1 ) + Ψ2 φ2 (z) cos(k2 x − ω0 t + γ2 ),

(2.36)

where Ψ1 and Ψ2 are real constants with no dependence on space or time. The solution
at order (ǫ2 ) then turns out to be (Varma & Mathur 2017)
ψ2 = h̄12 (z) cos[(k1 + k2 )x − 2ω0 t + γ1 + γ2 ] + ḡ12 (z) cos[(k1 − k2 )x + γ1 − γ2 ], (2.37)
comprising a superharmonic wave at frequency 2ω0 (and horizontal wavenumber k1 +
k2 ) and a time-independent mean flow of horizontal wavenumber k1 − k2 (with vertical
structure ḡ12 (z)). The vertical structure, h̄12 (z) of the superharmonic wave is governed

with C̄12 = −(A12 + A21 )/(4ω 2 − f 2 ), where A12 is as defined in equation (2.19). h̄12 (z)
satisfies the boundary conditions h̄12 (z = 0) = h̄12 (z = H) = 0. If modes m & n at frequency ω0 are in triadic resonance with the superharmonic wave in equation (2.37), the

10

resulting h̄12 would diverge (Varma & Mathur 2017). Away from the triadic resonance,
equation (2.38) can be numerically solved to obtain a finite solution, with the magnitude of h̄12 diverging towards infinity as we approach triadic resonance. In the current
study, a plot of the magnitude of h̄12 (defined as hmax = max[h̄12 (z)]) in the neighbourhood of triadic resonance parameters provides a reference using which the near-resonant
behaviour observed in numerical simulations is interpreted.

3. Numerical simulations
Direct numerical simulations are performed to (i) demonstrate the spontaneous generation of the theoretically predicted superharmonic internal wave due to resonant interaction between internal wave modes, (ii) quantitatively validate the initial spatial growth
of the superharmonic wave estimated from the amplitude evolution equations derived in
section 2.1 , (iii) investigate off-resonance superharmonic generation, which is outside the
scope of the theory presented in section 2.1. The aforementioned goals are achieved for
two representative scenarios: (a) modes 1 & 2 interacting in a uniform stratification, and
(b) self-interaction of mode 3 in a nonuniform stratification. In the rest of this section, we
describe the numerical framework, list out all the numerical simulations performed, and
present the methods used to analyze the output data from the numerical simulations.
3.1. The SOMAR framework
Two dimensional numerical simulations are performed using SOMAR (Santilli & Scotti
2015; Chalamalla et al. 2017), which is an adaptive mesh numerical framework. SOMAR
solves a set of conservation equations for momentum and buoyancy on a composite grid
consisting of several levels, each at different resolution. This increases efficiency and
allows the resolution of a wide range of scales with a reduced computational cost when
compared to a traditional single-level solver. In the current study, however we consider
a single level grid at a uniform resolution in both horizontal and vertical directions. For
details about the adaptive mesh capabilities of SOMAR, see Santilli & Scotti (2015);
Chalamalla et al. (2017). SOMAR uses second-order, central finite differences for the
spatial discretization of viscous and diffusion terms, computed semi-implicitly for time
advancement. Advection terms are computed using the finite volume Piecewise-Parabolic
Method (PPM) of Colella & Woodward (1984).
3.2. Governing equations
Two dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are solved on cartesian grids. In SOMAR, the
buoyancy field is split into the background b(z) and perturbation b∗ (x, y, z, t) fields:
b(x, y, z, t) = b(z) + b∗ (x, y, z, t).
(3.1)

The background buoyancy is given by b(z) = − 0 N dz, where N (z) is the background
buoyancy frequency profile. The governing equations are given by

internal wave modes m & n at frequency ω0 are forced at x = 0, and are allowed to evolve over
the domain length D. A sponge layer of width D/8 at the right end of the domain ensures that
no wave energy gets reflected back into the computational domain. The boundary conditions
at z = 0 and z = H are indicated next to the corresponding boundaries. The ”star” symbols

hydrostatic pressure distribution, ν is the molecular viscosity, κ is the molecular diffusivity. In all the numerical simulations considered in this study, the molecular viscosity and
diffusivity values are taken to be 1×10−6 m2 /s. The governing equations in (3.2)-(3.4) are
numerically solved on a two-dimensional computational domain of length D and height
H. A schematic of the computational domain is shown in figure 2.
It is noteworthy that no explicit noise is added in our numerical simulations. In other
words, the growth of any superharmonic waves is spontaneous and does not rely on
any initial energy being put into them. The potentially important role of a prescribed
background noise (of different amplitudes) would be investigated in a future study.
3.3. Boundary conditions
At the left boundary (x = 0), a combination of mode-m and mode-n waves at the forcing
frequency ω0 are specified as a function of time. Specifically, the boundary conditions at
x = 0 are:

to absorb the internal wave energy. At the top (z = H) and bottom (z = 0) boundaries,
no-normal flow (w = 0) and free-slip (∂u/∂z = 0) boundary conditions are enforced. The
schematic in figure 2 provides a summary of the boundary conditions.

the numbers next to them denoting the case numbers specified in table 1.

3.4. Simulation cases: parameters, domain and grid resolution
As mentioned in the beginning of this section, we perform numerical simulations for
representative cases in uniform and nonuniform stratifications.
3.4.1. Uniform stratification
Here, we consider the interaction between modes 1 & 2 in a uniform stratification N0 .
For this case, Varma & Mathur (2017) showed the existence of a unique curve on the
ω0 /N0 − f /ω0 plane on which triadic resonance occurs. A plot of the superharmonic
wave amplitude based on the steady state theory (section 2.2) reveals the curve along
which modes 1 & 2 at frequency ω0 resonantly interact to result in the generation of an
infinitely large mode-1 internal wave at frequency 2ω0 (figure 3a). Numerical simulations
are performed at and around the triadic resonance curve in the limit of f = 0 (no
background rotation), i.e. a close neighbourhood of the solid black circle in figure 3(a).
As shown in figure 3(b), the steady state amplitude of mode-1 at frequency 2ω0 (section
2.2) diverges at ω0 /N0 = 0.3953 as a result of resonant interaction between modes 1 & 2
at frequency ω0 . The amplitude evolution equations derived in section 2.1 provide a nondiverging non-steady-state evolution of the resonant triad at these resonant frequencies.
The numerical simulation in which primary wave modes 1 & 2 at frequency ω0 /N0 =
0.3953 are forced at the left end of the computational domain is denoted as case 5, and is
used to validate the amplitude evolution equations derived in section 2.1. Cases 5a and
5b correspond to the same primary wave frequency as case 5, but with different domain
length and primary wave forcing amplitudes, respectively. Cases 1-4 and 5-9 explore
primary wave frequencies that are smaller and larger than the resonant frequency of
ω0 /N0 = 0.3953, respectively. It is noteworthy that the amplitude evolution equations
derived in section 2.1 are, strictly speaking, valid only at resonant frequencies. Numerical
simulations at the off-resonant frequencies are therefore required to identify the range of
frequencies over which triadic resonance-like behaviour occurs.
The primary wave frequencies corresponding to all the cases 1-9 are indicated in figure
3(b), and are also shown in table 1. The forcing amplitudes of modes 1 & 2 at frequency
ω0 (equations 3.5-3.7) are also shown in table 1. Except for case 5b, these amplitudes
correspond to an overall primary wave energy flux of 2000W/m, with 90% of it in mode-1.
In case 5b, the forcing amplitudes for both modes 1 & 2 are halved, thus corresponding
to an overall primary wave energy flux of 500W/m. The horizontal and vertical spatial

Table 1. Parameter values in the eleven different numerical simulations we present for the
uniform stratification. Modes 1 & 2 at frequency ω0 are forced with amplitudes W1 and W2 (see
equation 3.6) at x = 0. λ1 denotes the horizontal wavelength of mode-1 at frequency ω0 . The
computational grid for all the cases contained 4096 points in the horizontal to represent 5λ1
(8192 points for case 5a) and 1024 points in the vertical to represent the ocean depth H.

resolution in all the cases 1-9 are dx ≈ 20m and dz ≈ 3.7m, respectively. These values
correspond to around 820, 410 & 270 grid points per wavelength of mode-1 at ω0 , mode-2
at ω0 and mode-1 at 2ω0 , respectively. The temporal resolution of 2s in all the cases 1-9
corresponds to around 725 time steps per time period of the superharmonic wave. The
depth of the computational domain is fixed at H = 3800m, and the uniform stratification
at N0 = 5.477 × 10−3rad/s, both of which are somewhat representative of the ocean. The
length of the computational domain is chosen to be around five times the horizontal
wavelength of the primary wave mode-1 (except case 5a), which we find to be sufficiently
long to capture the initial spatial growth of the superharmonic wave. The computational
domain length is doubled for case 5a so as to demonstrate domain size independence of
the initial growth rate of the superharmonic wave.
3.4.2. Nonuniform stratification
We consider the self-interaction of mode-3 at frequency ω0 in a nonuniform stratification profile (ocean depth H = 3800m) given by
N (z) = N0 + (Nmax − N0 ) exp(−(z − zc )2 /σ 2 ),

(3.8)

with the deep ocean stratification N0 = 5.477 × 10−3 rad/s, the maximum pycnocline
stratification Nmax = 4N0 at zc = 3400m, and the pycnocline half-width σ = 250m.
As shown by Varma & Mathur (2017), the self-interaction of mode-3 at frequency ω0 in
the stratification given by equation (3.8) corresponds to three different curves on the
ω0 /N0 − f /ω0 plane on which triadic resonance occurs. A plot of the superharmonic
wave amplitude from the steady-state theory (section 2.2) in figure 4(a) shows these
three different curves, where the mode number of the superharmonic internal wave is
1 or 2 (as indicated by the encircled numbers in figure 4a). In this paper, we perform
numerical simulations at and around the solid black circle in figure 4(a), i.e. around one

of the triadic resonance curves in the limit of no background rotation (f = 0). Figure 4(b)
shows the nine different frequencies at which numerical simulations are run, with cases
5, 5a and 5b being at the primary wave frequency for which triadic resonance occurs.
The primary wave frequencies corresponding to all the cases 1-9 are shown in table 2.
The forcing amplitudes of mode 3 at frequency ω0 (equations 3.5-3.7) are also shown in
table 2. Except for case 5a and 5b, these amplitudes correspond to an overall primary
wave energy flux of 500W/m. In cases 5a and 5b (relatively longer domain for case 5b),
the forcing amplitudes for mode 3 is made one-fifths, thus corresponding to an overall
primary wave energy flux of 20W/m. The horizontal and vertical spatial resolution in all
the cases 1-9 are dx ≈ 8m and dz ≈ 3.7m, respectively. These values correspond to around
820 & 410 grid points per wavelength of mode-3 at ω0 and mode-2 at 2ω0 , respectively.
The temporal resolution of 0.5s in all the cases 1-9 corresponds to around 2570 time steps
per time period of the superharmonic wave. The length of the computational domain is
chosen to be around five times the horizontal wavelength of the primary wave mode-3
(except case 5b), which we find to be sufficiently long to capture the initial spatial growth
of the superharmonic wave. The computational domain length is doubled for case 5b so as
to demonstrate domain size independence of the initial growth rate of the superharmonic
wave.
3.5. Analysis of simulated wave fields
Temporally and spatially resolved horizontal and vertical velocity fields were written as
outputs from the numerical simulation of each of the cases in tables 1 and 2. In the
uniform stratification cases, the output was written at a temporal resolution of 8s, corresponding to around 360 points per one primary wave time period. For the nonuniform
stratification cases, the temporal resolution was 16s, which corresponds to around 180
points per one primary wave time period. For both the uniform and nonuniform stratification cases, the vertical resolution of the written output was retained at the same value
as that of the computational grid, i.e. 1024 points to represent the entire ocean depth. In
the horizontal, data was written at around 400 points that span the entire computational
domain length.
The uniform and nonuniform stratification simulations were typically run for a total
time of around 40T , which was verified to be long enough that the wave field amplitude
at various frequencies and modes attains a steady state everywhere in the computational

ensure domain size independence of our results, the simulation was run up to around

40T were used to calculate the strength, and subsequently filter, at the primary (forcing)
and superharmonic frequencies.

number associated with the q th wave in the resonant triad.
The output data from the numerical simulations are subjected to a modal decomposition analysis to estimate the horizontal evolution of the modal amplitudes, WΩj 0 (x). At
a given x = x0 , the filtered vertical velocity is represented as

wΩ0 (x0 , z, t) = A(z) cos Ω0 t + B(z) sin Ω0 t,

used. A plot of W2ω0 (x0 ) with x0 (recall from figure 1 that p is the mode number of
superharmonic wave) allows us to estimate a slope, and hence validate the theoretical
prediction for the early spatial growth of the superharmonic secondary wave while the
primary wave amplitudes are assumed to be nearly constant. While the secondary superharmonic waves are not necessarily internal waves for ω0 away from the value at which
triadic resonance occurs, we still perform the post-processing analysis described in this
section for the off-resonance cases to quantify the behaviour away from triadic resonance.
The analysis tools described in this section have also been implemented on the horizontal
velocity field from each of our numerical simulations, and the corresponding results are
entirely consistent with what we report in § 4 based on the vertical velocity fields.

4. Results
While the amplitude evolution equations derived in § 2.1 are valid for any resonant
triad comprising three internal wave modes, we focus on the specific topic of spontaneous superharmonic generation due to triadic resonance between two primary internal
wave modes at a frequency ω0 and a secondary superharmonic internal wave mode at
frequency 2ω0 . The aim of this section is to study the dynamics of such resonant triads
by analyzing the solutions of the amplitude evolution equations, and validate some of
the theoretical results using direct numerical simulations. In § 4.1, we consider a scenario
where two primary wave modes (m = 1, n = 2) at the same frequency in a uniform
stratification form a resonant triad with a superharmonic internal wave mode (p = 1). In
§ 4.2, we consider an idealized nonuniform stratification representative of the ocean, and
investigate a scenario where a self-interacting primary mode-3 internal wave is in triadic
resonance with a superharmonic mode-2 wave.

As mentioned in § 2, the primary wave field (modes m & n at frequency ω0 ) is assumed to
derive its finite initial energy from physical mechanisms such as internal tide generation
or scattering by ocean floor topography. Specifically, we assume that the total energy
flux ET in the primary wave field at frequency ω0 is divided as (1 − β)ET in mode-m
and βET in mode-n. Furthermore, the superharmonic secondary wave is assumed to have
zero initial energy flux in the theoretical calculations, and no explicit noise is added in
the numerical simulations. In this subsection, we focus on the specific case of m = 1,
n = 2 and f = 0. Substituting m = 1, n = 2 and f = 0 in equation (4.1), we obtain
ω0 /N0 = 0.3953. In the notation of section § 2.1, the corresponding resonant triad is
characterized by the values indicated in the first three columns of table 3.
4.1.1. Theory
For a uniform stratification, the coefficients in the amplitude evolution equations
(2.29)-(2.31) for a resonant triad can be evaluated analytically; for the sake of brevity,
we do not show the final analytical expressions here. We proceed to calculate the specific
values of these coefficients using representative values of H = 3800m, N0 = 5.477 ×
10−3 rad/s, ρ̄ = 1000kg/m3 and the normalised mode shapes corresponding to energy
flux in each wave mode being unity are given by

The values of the coefficients α1 , α2 and α3 for the resonant triad considered in this
section are indicated in the fourth column of table 3.
For a given resonant triad, the analytical solution of the amplitude evolution equations
for small X can be obtained by assuming that the primary wave amplitudes remain
spatially invariant. This assumption is reasonable since the initial amplitudes of the
primary waves are typically much larger than those for the secondary waves. Specifically,
the initial spatial evolution of the secondary wave amplitude in the resonant triad is

where Ψ1 (X = 0) = (1 − β)ET , Ψ2 (X = 0) = βET and p

initial growth rate Γ to sustain for large distances, the quantity |Ψ3 |2 (the energy flux in
the superharmonic wave) would grow to a fraction δ of the initial primary wave energy

(λ1 is the horizontal wavelength of the primary mode-1 wave). Increasing β to 0.5 with
ET remaining at 2000W/m, the corresponding values of Xδ /λ1 decrease to ≈ 14, 32 and
45. While the initial growth rate estimates suggest that the growth of the superharmonic
wave can be significant for values of ET and β representative of the ocean, the assumption
of sustained growth at the initial growth rate Γ is invalid for large X. We therefore proceed
to plot the numerical solutions of the amplitude evolution equations where Ψ1 , Ψ2 and
Ψ3 simultaneously evolve.

Figure 5 shows the numerical solutions of equations (4.5)-(4.7) for the resonant triad
listed in table 3, and with ET = 2000W/m. For β = 0.1 (top row of figure 5), the mode2 primary wave amplitude decays to zero at X/λ1 = 54 (figure 5b), while the mode-1
superharmonic wave amplitude reaches its maximum value of 0.447 (figure 5c). Over the
same horizontal distance, the mode-1 primary wave loses around 11.12% of its energy
(figure 5a). After reaching their respective minimum values, the primary waves start to
increase in their amplitude towards their initial values while the superharmonic wave
amplitude decreases towards 0. The initial wave field is then seen again at X/λ1 = 108.
This periodic behaviour then persists for larger X too.
In the bottom row of figure 5, we plot the theoretical amplitude evolution for β = 0.5.
With Ψ̃1 = Ψ̃2 at X = 0, and α1 ≈ α2 (see table 3), the evolution of Ψ̃1 and Ψ̃2 are quite
similar. Both Ψ̃1 and Ψ̃2 decrease to around 21.4 % of their initial value over around
X1 /λ1 = 100, and remain even smaller for a further distance of around 290λ1 . While
the decay distance for β = 0.5 is larger than that for β = 0.1, it is noteworthy that the
superharmonic wave for β = 0.5 possesses almost the entire primary wave energy over
significantly large distances.
From the numerical solutions such as those in figure 5, we estimate the maximum value

of the initial primary wave energy that gets transferred to the superharmonic wave. While
around 20% of the initial primary wave energy gets transferred to the superharmonic

primary wave energy gets transferred to the superharmonic wave, as was already seen in
the bottom row of figure 5. The horizontal distance, Xmax at which the superharmonic
wave amplitude reaches ∆ of its maximum value is plotted as a function of β in figure

transferred to the superharmonic wave by around 50λ1 . In the fictitious limit of sustained
growth of the superharmonic wave at its initial growth rate Γ, the distances plotted in
figure 6(b) would be smaller, as shown in figure 6(c). Finally, we note that the horizontal

over distances that are a few tens of the primary mode-1 wavelength if we consider
parameter values that are somewhat representative of the ocean. This superharmonic
wave generation mechanism should therefore be a consideration along with other triadic
resonances like the parameteric subharmonic instability, a topic we discuss further in § 5.
We now proceed to validate our theoretical results, i.e. the generation of a superharmonic
wave and its corresponding spatial growth, using direct numerical simulations. In the
numerical simulations, we simulate only the initial growth of the superharmonic wave,
and leave the topic of the wave field evolution over very large distances to a future study.
4.1.2. Simulations
The details of the numerical simulations are described in § 3, and the specific cases we
run for a uniform stratification are listed in table 1. While cases 5, 5a and 5b correspond
exactly to the primary wave frequency at which triadic resonance occurs, the other cases
correspond to off-resonance scenarios. Figure 3(b) shows the relative positioning of the
various off-resonance cases with respect to the primary wave frequency at which triadic
resonance occurs, i.e. cases 5, 5a and 5b.
Figure 7 shows the evolution of the numerically simulated vertical velocity field for
case-5, i.e. the triadic resonance case. Modes 1 & 2 at the primary wave frequency ω0 are
forced at x = 0, and it is evident from figures 7(a)-(c) that mode-1 propagates faster than
mode-2. At t = 16T , both the primary wave modes seem to have reached the right end of
the computational domain, where a sponge layer absorbs all the incoming wave energy
(figure 7d). The simulations were run for a further time of 24T to ensure that steady
state is reached throughout the domain with respect to the primary and secondary wave
amplitudes. Finally, the simulated flow from 34T-40T is considered for further analysis
of the steady state wave field.
Figure 8 shows the steady state Fourier spectrum (see equation (3.9) for the definition
c ) at nine different locations in the computational domain. A finite energy at the
of W
superharmonic frequency of Ω = 2ω0 is evident at all locations, with the corresponding
c growing from x = D/4 (figure 8a) to x = 3D/4 (figure 8c). Additionally,
strength of W
the region close to x = 0 seems to contain some energy away from Ω = 2ω0 as well,
specifically Ω ≈ 2.35ω0 at x = D/4, which we attribute to nonlinearities that may be
associated with our forcing mechanism at x = 0. While figure 8 confirms the generation of
the superharmonic frequency, it is important to calculate the spatial structure at Ω = 2ω0

to verify if it is indeed a superharmonic mode-1 internal wave as predicted by theory.
We therefore filter the numerically simulated wave fields at Ω = ω0 and 2ω0 , with the
corresponding widths of the frequency bands indicated by the solid and dashed vertical
lines, respectively, in figure 8.
Figure 9(a) shows the vertical velocity field filtered at the primary wave frequency
Ω = ω0 , with the filtering process described in detail in § 3.5. The spatial structure
of wω0 in figure 9(a) corresponds to a combination of modes 1 & 2, consistent with the
forcing provided at x = 0. The vertical profiles of wω0 at two x locations separated by one
mode-1 wavelength show a combination of mode-1 & mode-2, and are almost identical
(figure 9b). The spatial structure of the wave field filtered at the superharmonic frequency
(2ω0 ) clearly shows a predominant mode-1, and the wavelength of ≈ 6km in w2ω0 is fully
consistent with the theoretically estimated horizontal wavelength of mode-1 at frequency

2ω0 (figure 9c). Figure 9(c) thus provides numerical evidence of the generation of mode-1
superharmonic internal wave as a result of resonant interaction between modes 1 & 2 at
the primary wave frequency.
In figure 10, we plot the vertical velocity amplitude of the primary modes 1 & 2, and
the superharmonic mode-1 as a function of x. The definition of the modal amplitudes at
ω0 and 2ω0 , and the methodology used to compute them from numerical simulations are
discussed in § 3.5. Figures 10(a) and (b) show that the amplitude of primary modes 1 &
2 remain almost constant over the entire domain, and their values are consistent with the
amplitudes forced at x = 0. Small spatial variations in the primary modal amplitudes
suggest that the superharmonic wave would grow with the initial growth rate Γ (see
§ 4.1.1) throughout the domain. Indeed, figure 10(c) confirms that the vertical velocity
amplitude of mode-1 at frequency 2ω0 increases almost linearly with x. Furthermore,
the theoretical initial growth rate of the superharmonic wave based on the amplitude
evolution equations captures the simulated growth rate quite accurately. In summary,
figure 10 provides quantitative validation of the initial amplitude evolution predicted
by the theory presented in § 4.1.1. As shown in appendix B, numerical simulation of
the resonant case 5 with a longer domain, i.e. case 5a in table 1, reproduces the same
initial growth rate for the superharmonic wave. Finally, numerical simulation of the
resonant case 5 with smaller forcing amplitudes, i.e. case 5b in table 1, also show an
initial superharmonic wave growth that quantitatively agrees with the prediction of the
amplitude evolution equations (appendix B).
We proceed to numerically investigate the off-resonance cases listed in table 1, i.e.
cases 1-4 and 6-9. It is worthwhile recalling that the amplitude evolution equations are
valid only at the resonant frequency, and hence cannot be used to predict the results
from the off-resonance cases. Figure 11 shows the steady state Fourier spectra of the
vertical velocity field for cases 1-4, with the topmost row being closest to the resonant
case 5. The generation of the superharmonic frequency 2ω0 is evident in case-4, with
the corresponding amplitude being comparable to that of case-5. Superharmonic wave
generation is observed in cases 1-3 too, with the corresponding amplitudes becoming
weaker as we move further away from the resonant case-5. Interestingly, the off-resonance
cases 1 and 2 show the presence of frequencies larger than 2ω0 , the origins of which are
not clear. To quantify the generation of superharmonic (2ω0 ) waves in the off-resonance
cases, we perform the modal decomposition analysis described in § 3.4, though the offresonance superharmonic waves are not internal waves.

Figure 12 shows the variation of the computed initial growth rate Γ of the mode-1
superharmonic wave with the primary wave frequency ω0 . The insets in figure 12 show the

for all the off-resonance cases. For cases 4 and 6, which are closest
spatial variation of W2ω

to the resonant case-5, the superharmonic wave growth is almost as strong as the resonant
case-5. Moving further away from resonance, the superharmonic wave growth decreases,
before becoming negligible for cases 1 and 9. Interestingly, the width of the peak in Γ
seems larger than the width of the peak in the superharmonic wave amplitude based on
the steady state theory in § 2.2. Figure 12 thus shows that the resonant generation of
superharmonic internal waves at ω0 /N0 = 0.3953 has its signature even at off-resonance
frequencies that are around 0.04N0 away from the resonant frequency.
4.2. Nonuniform Stratification
In a typical nonuniform stratification representative of the ocean, Varma & Mathur
(2017) showed that a larger number of triadic resonances resulting from modal interactions at a fixed frequency are possible when compared to a uniform stratification.
Under certain conditions, Varma & Mathur (2017) showed that even an isolated internal
wave mode (of arbitrary amplitude) may be inherently unstable; such a triadic resonance
resulting from self-interaction of an isolated mode is not possible in a uniform stratification. In this section, we investigate the amplitude evolution associated with one such
self-interaction scenario.
In the nonuniform stratification given by equation (3.8), Varma & Mathur (2017)
showed that a self-interacting mode-3 at ω/N0 = 0.4466 is in triadic resonance with
mode-2 at the superharmonic frequency 2ω for f = 0. We solve the amplitude evolution
equations corresponding to this case, and also perform DNS at and around the resonant
frequency.
4.2.1. Theory
The frequencies and horizontal wavenumbers associated with the three waves that
make up the resonant triad are listed in table 4. As mentioned earlier, owing to the selfinteraction case being considered, waves 1 and 2 both represent mode-3 at ω/N0 = 0.4466.
The values of the coefficients α1 , α2 and α3 (equations 2.32-2.34) are also listed in table
4, with α3 being twice of what is given by equation (2.34). Since waves 1 and 2 are the
same, 4|Ψ1 |2 represents the energy flux in the primary mode-3 at ω while |Ψ3 |2 represents
the energy flux in the superharmonic mode-2.
Assuming Ψ1 to remain constant for small X, the early spatial evolution of Ψ3 can be
written as
Ψ3 (X) = Ψ3 (X = 0) + iα3 [Ψ1 (X = 0)]2 X,
(4.8)
√
where Ψ1 (X = 0) = ET /2 and Ψ3 (X = 0) = 0. Using the value of α3 listed in table 4,
and ET = 2000W/m, this initial growth would transfer around 17 %, 30 % and 47 % of the
initial energy to the superharmonic mode-2 over 30, 40 and 50 wavelengths of the primary
mode-3, respectively if the initial growth rate sustains. The primary wave amplitude,
however, does not remain constant, and we therefore compute the numerical solution of
the amplitude evolution equations to estimate the growth of the superharmonic wave
over large horizontal distances.

As done in section 4.1, we normalize Ψ1 , Ψ2 and Ψ3 by ET so that 4|Ψ
represent the fraction of the initial primary wave energy flux ET that is in the primary
and secondary (superharmonic) waves, respectively. Figure 13 shows the spatial evolution
of 2|Ψ̃1 | and |Ψ̃3 |, as obtained by numerically solving the amplitude evolution equations
(2.29)-(2.30) for ET = 2000W/m. Over 30, 40 and 50 wavelengths of the primary mode3, around 15 %, 25% and 35% of the overall energy is transferred to the superharmonic

mode-2. Remarkably, over a sufficiently large distance, almost all the primary wave energy
is transferred to the superharmonic wave, and the wave field switches permanently from
the state of all the energy being in the primary mode-3 to the state of all the energy
being in the secondary superharmonic wave. In other words, the primary mode-3 at
frequency ω/N0 = 0.4466 is inherently unstable, and would spontaneously transfer all its
energy to the superharmonic mode-2. Similar to our conclusion in § 4.1.1, for other values
of ET , qualitatively
√ similar dynamics occur, but over spatial extents that are inversely
proportional to ET .
4.2.2. Simulations
Direct numerical simulations are performed with two different aims: (i) to validate the
theoretically estimated early spatial growth of the superharmonic wave in § 4.2.1, and (ii)
to investigate the wave field evolution at off-resonant frequencies, i.e. frequencies away
from ω/N0 = 0.4466. The details of all the cases run for the nonuniform stratification
are listed in Table 2, with case 5 corresponding to the frequency at which triadic resonance occurs. As mentioned in section 3.4.2, the forcing amplitudes for the nonuniform
stratification cases were such that the total energy flux was 500W/m, which allowed us
to accurately capture the weakly nonlinear regime with the computational grid size and
time step values given in § 3.4.2.

nonuniform stratification. The occurrence of the superharmonic frequency 2ω0 is evident
at all spatial locations, with an increase in its strength with x. Unlike uniform stratification cases, there are no noticeable peaks at frequencies away from ω0 and 2ω0 , probably
owing to the relatively smaller forcing amplitudes we have used for the nonuniform stratification. The vertical lines in figure 14 indicate the frequency bands used for filtering
the wave fields at the primary frequency ω0 and the superharmonic frequency 2ω0 .

profiles from two different x locations confirm the mode-3 structure, with no noticeable
difference in the amplitude between the two locations (figure 15b). The wave field at 2ω0
(figure 15c) shows a predominantly mode-2 spatial structure, with the contamination
by other modes becoming smaller as we go further away from the forcing location. The
vertical profiles shown in figure 15(d) confirm the predominant mode-2 structure, with a
clear increase in the amplitude with x. In summary, figure 15 presents a clear evidence
from numerical simulations that a superharmonic mode-2 is spontaneously generated as a
result of self-interaction of mode-3 at ω/N0 = 0.4466. We proceed to quantify the modal
amplitudes in the wave fields shown in figure 15, and quantitatively compare the growth

derived in section 2.1.
Figure 16(a) shows the amplitude of mode-3 at ω0 , estimated from the wave field
in figure 15(a) using the methods described in section 3.5. The vertical velocity modal
amplitude Wω30 is reasonably constant throughout the computational domain, consistent
with the forcing amplitude indicated by the dashed line in figure 16(a). The spatial growth

growth predicted by the amplitude evolution equations assuming Wω30 to be constant
at the forcing value (figure 16b). Thus, figure 16 provides quantitative validation of the
early spatial growth of the superharmonic wave predicted by the amplitude evolution
equations derived in section 2.1. Finally, to verify that the superharmonic wave growth
in the numerical simulations is independent of the forcing amplitude or the computational
domain length, we present results from two other runs at the resonant frequency in figure
20 (appendix A).
While the amplitude evolution equations derived in section 2.1 are valid only at the
resonant frequency, it is worthwhile investigating the generation of superharmonic waves
at off-resonant frequencies as well. Towards this objective, we ran eight more numerical
simulations, as described by cases 1-4 and 6-9 listed in table 2. Figure 17 shows the steady
state Fourier spectra of the vertical velocity time series at different spatial locations as
we move away from the resonant frequency, i.e. cases 4 to 1 from the top to bottom
rows. The occurrence of a spatially growing superharmonic wave is evident for case-4
(top row of figure 17), which is closest to the resonant case-5. At other off-resonant
frequencies, relatively weaker strengths are observed at 2ω0 , while newer frequencies
higher than 2ω0 seem to emerge. We quantify the spatial growth of the superharmonic
mode-2 at various off-resonant primary wave forcing frequencies in figure 18, whereas a

Spontaneous superharmonic internal wave generation by modal interactions

29

detailed investigation of the generation of even higher frequencies (> 2ω0 ) is left out of
the current study as it is outside the scope of the amplitude evolution equations derived
in section 2.1.
As mentioned in § 3.5, the flow fields filtered at 2ω0 from the off-resonant cases were
subject to modal decomposition too, though the superharmonic waves are not necessarily
internal waves. Figure 18 shows the variation of the normalized initial growth rate ΓN
(= Γ/(|Ψ1 (X = 0)||Ψ2 (X = 0)|) of the supherharmonic mode-2 amplitude with ω0 /N0 .
As expected, the value of ΓN is α3 at the resonant case-5, and decreases towards zero as
we go far from the resonant frequency. Interestingly, there is noticeable generation of the
superharmonic mode-2 even in cases 4 and 6, which are close to but not at resonance.
Finally, the width of the peak in ΓN vs. ω0 seems wider than the peak in the variation of the amplitude from steady-state theory, suggesting that the superharmonic wave
generation due to triadic resonance is not restricted to the resonant frequency alone.

5. Discussion and Conclusions
In this paper, we have derived the amplitude evolution equations that govern energy
transfer between three internal wave modes that form a resonant triad in a finite-depth
fluid with an arbitrary stratification profile and background rotation. Allowing slow spatial evolution of the three modal amplitudes, and invoking the triadic resonance condition
in a nonuniform stratification (Varma & Mathur 2017), the amplitude evolution equations essentially ensure that resonant divergence of the weakly nonlinear solution does
not occur even when finite energy is present in all the waves that form the resonant
triad. Our theoretical framework could potentially model how the energy in a linearly
forced internal wave field such as the internal tides or near-inertial internal waves could
get redistributed to other frequencies and wavenumbers as the waves propagate away
from their generation location. It is noteworthy that the amplitude evolution equations
derived in this paper are valid for any internal wave resonant triad containing modes,
though the specific cases studied in § 4.1 and § 4.2 focused on superharmonic wave generation due to modal interactions. The primary wave energy decay due to superharmonic
wave generation could potentially be significant since an appreciable amount of energy
is initially injected into two of the waves that form the superharmonic resonant triad.
In section § 4.1, we considered the scenario of modes 1 & 2 at ω/N0 = 0.3953 in
triadic resonance with mode-1 at the superharmonic frequency 2ω in a uniform stratification. The numerical solutions of the amplitude evolution equations for this resonant
triad showed that a significant fraction of the primary wave energy would be transferred
to the superharmonic wave for realistic ocean-like parameters. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) then provided evidence for the spontaneous generation of the superharmonic
mode-1 as a result of resonant interaction between modes 1 & 2 at ω0 /N0 = 0.3953. The
initial spatial growth rate predicted by the amplitude evolution equations were quantitatively validated by the DNS. Furthermore, DNS were run at off-resonant primary
wave frequencies to show that superharmonic wave generation occurs away from the triadic resonance as well. In § 4.2.2, we studied the case of a self-interacting mode-3 at
ω0 /N0 = 0.4466 in triadic resonance with the superharmonic mode-2 in a nonuniform
stratification with a pycnocline. The spontaneous generation of the superharmonic mode2 even when it has no initial energy was demonstrated in DNS, which was also used to
quantitatively validate the initial spatial growth predicted by the amplitude evolution
equations. Finally, like for the uniform stratification, superharmonic wave generation is
observed even at off-resonant frequencies in the nonuniform stratification. Finally, the
specific triadic resonances considered in section 4 are only representative, and similar

Figure 19. Spatial evolution of the primary wave amplitudes: (a) mode-1 at frequency
ω0 /N0 = 0.3953, (b) mode-2 at frequency ω0 /N0 = 0.3953, as obtained from the numerical
solutions of the amplitude evolution equations corresponding to specific superharmonic and
subharmonic resonant triads comprising the primary waves in a uniform stratification. Specifically, the solid curves in both (a) and (b) correspond to the superharmonic resonant triad
discussed in section 4.1.1, with the value of β indicated in the legend. The dashed curves correspond to subharmonic resonant triads, with the secondary waves indicated by the mode numbers
in the legend, and the primary wave being (a) mode-1 at ω0 /N0 = 0.3953 and (b) mode-2 at
ω0 /N0 = 0.3953. A negative mode number indicates propagation in a direction opposite to the
primary waves. For the subharmonic resonant triads, the daughter waves were initiated with an
amplitude that corresponds to 1% of the primary wave energy. For the superharmonic resonant
triads, ET = 2000W/m has been assumed.

studies involving superharmonic wave generation due to higher mode interactions could
be useful.
Apart from the superharmonic resonant triad, each of the primary waves is also a part
of infinitely many subharmonic resonant triads. For example, the left-to-right propagating
mode-1 at ω0 /N0 = 0.3953 in the uniform stratification is also in triadic resonance with
the right-to-left propagating mode-1 at ω1 /N0 = 0.1266 and the left-to-right propagating
mode-2 at ω2 /N0 = 0.2687. As shown in figure 19(a), this subharmonic resonant triad
is very inefficient in transferring energy out of the primary wave to the subharmonic
secondary waves, which typically have a very small amount of initial energy that is
available from the background noise. In contrast, the superharmonic resonant triad can
transfer a significant fraction of the primary mode-1 energy to the superharmonic wave,
with the fraction being larger for larger β and independent of ET . Interestingly, there
exists no subharmonic resonant triad for the mode-1 primary wave at ω0 /N0 = 0.3953
such that both the daughter waves propagate in the same direction as the primary wave.
In figure 19(b), we provide a comparison between the superharmonic resonant triad and
two representative subharmonic resonant triads that comprise mode-2 at ω0 /N0 = 0.3953
as the primary wave. The subharmonic resonant triad with mode-1 at ω1 /N0 = 0.1725
and mode-3 at ω2 /N0 = 0.2228 as daughter waves is observed to be capable of extracting
all the energy out of the primary mode-2, but at a rate that is significantly slower than
the superharmonic resonant triad for all three values of β considered. For the primary
wave decay rate in the superharmonic resonant triad with β = 0.1 to become comparable
to what is observed for the (1,3) subharmonic resonant triad in figure 19(b), ET has to
be reduced by a √
factor of around 9 (recall from section 4.1.1 that the normalized decay
rate scales as 1/ ET ). In other words, even for ET as small as around 200W/m, the
primary wave decay rate due to the superharmonic resonant triad is comparable to what
occurs due to the (1,3) subharmonic resonant triad. In summary, figure 19 suggests that
the superharmonic wave generation is likely to significantly modify any energy transfer
estimates due to triadic resonances, at least in and around the resonant primary wave
frequencies. Future studies that account for all possible subharmonic resonant triads, and
their simultaneous evolution with the superharmonic resonant triad would be insightful.

Spontaneous superharmonic internal wave generation by modal interactions

31

The real ocean scenario typically has several modes excited simultaneously at the
forcing frequency. With respect to internal tides, it is well recognized that a barotropic
forcing on the ocean floor topography excites several modes at the tidal frequency, with
the lower modes carrying relatively larger amount of energy. Similarly, wind forcing on the
ocean surface is known to input energy into various modes at the near-inertial frequency.
Furthermore, Varma & Mathur (2017) have shown that the occurrence of a resonant triad
containing two modes at the forcing frequency, and a third mode at the superharmonic
frequency is highly likely when more than a few modes are simultaneously generated.
It therefore seems important that superharmonic wave generation as a result of modal
interaction is considered alongside other triadic resonances like PSI when a finite amount
of energy is put into several modes at a given forcing frequency. Future theoretical studies
could incorporate the simultaneous presence of several modes at the forcing frequency,
and all the resonant triads that they are a part of. It may also be worthwhile to investigate
the role of background noise that may inject small but finite amounts of energy in the
resonant triad components that are not at the forcing frequency. Finally, incorporating
viscous dissipation in the amplitude evolution equations would make them more relevant
to describe observations from laboratory/numerical/ field experiments.
Direct numerical simulations and/or laboratory experiments could be used to further
validate the amplitude evolution equations over a wider range of scenarios than what
is considered in this paper. Amplitude evolution over spatially large extents where the
growth of the superharmonic wave would not be linear would be particularly useful to
investigate. Further numerical or experimental studies at off-resonant frequencies should
shed light on the role of superharmonic wave generation in the ensuing instabilities, the
transition to turbulence and subsequent dissipation of internal waves. Finally, our study
shows that superharmonic wave generation in internal tides or near-inertial internal waves
may not be uncommon, and our theoretical framework could provide an understanding
of results from DNS or laboratory experiments or field studies. For example, the superharmonic wave generation upon wave beam reflection at a pycnocline (Diamessis et al.
2014; Mercier et al. 2012) could potentially be described using the ideas developed in
this paper.

To establish the numerical convergence of the spatial growth of the superharmonic
wave in the DNS of resonant cases in uniform and nonuniform stratifications, we ran
the same resonant cases with smaller forcing amplitude and/or longer computational
domain. As detailed in table 1 for the uniform stratification, case 5a corresponds to a
longer computational domain but at the same forcing amplitudes as case 5. Case 5b

corresponds to the same computational domain as for case 5, but with half the forcing
amplitudes as that of case 5. Similarly, cases 5, 5a and 5b in figure 20(b) are listed in
table 2 for the nonuniform stratification. While case 5a corresponds to one-fifths forcing
amplitude as that of case 5, case 5b also has a longer computational domain. The results
in figure 20 suggest that the initial growth rates observed in the DNS are the same for
the two computational domain lengths considered, and scale with the forcing amplitudes
in a manner consistent with the amplitude evolution equations derived in section 2.1.
