A family A ⊆ Sn,k,r is intersecting if A, B ∈ A implies A ∩ B 6= ∅.
A well-known result (first stated by Meyer and proved using different
methods by Deza and Frankl, and Bollobás and Leader) states that if

Introduction


Let [n] = {1, . . . , n} and let [n]
denote the collection of all k-subsets of [n].
k
Sets of sets are called families. A family F ⊆ 2[n] is intersecting if F,F ′ ∈ F
implies F ∩ F ′ 6= ∅. How
large can an intersecting family F ⊆ [n]
be? If
k

n
2k > n then |F | = k is obvious, while if 2k ≤ n then the answer is given
by the classical Erdős–Ko–Rado Theorem [12].

When n = 2k, the proof of the Erdős–Ko–Rado Theorem is easy. Simply
partition [2k]
into complementary pairs. Then, since F can contain at most

Erdős, Ko and Rado [12] introduced an important operation on families called
shifting.
A family is called non-trivial if there is no element common to all its
members. Hilton and Milner [17] showed that for n > 2k, S is the unique
maximal intersecting family.

There are various proofs of the Erdős–Ko–Rado Theorem (cf. [9, 15, 18,
20]) and the Hilton–Milner Theorem (cf. [13, 14, 18]). To keep this paper
short, let us highlight those which are particularly relevant to us: Frankl and
Füredi’s [15] and Hurlbert and Kamat’s [18] injective proofs of (1.1), and
Frankl’s [13] and Hurlbert and Kamat’s [18] injective proofs of (1.2).

We should mention that by “injective proof” we mean an explicit or implicit injection from F into a given intersecting family (usually a family whose
members contain a prescribed element). We believe that such proofs are of
interest, particularly in yielding further insight for the cases when the size of
intersecting families cannot be determined a priori ; as an example of such
a case see [5, Conjecture 1.4]. For further results in extremal set theory, we
refer the reader to the excellent monograph by Gerbner and Patkos [16].
We now define signed sets. Let k, r, n ≥ 1 be integers, and let Sn,k,r be
the family of r-signed k-sets on [n] given by
 
o
n
[n]
, a1 , . . . , ak ∈ [r] .
Sn,k,r = {(x1 , a1 ), . . . , (xk , ak )} : {x1 , . . . , xk } ∈
k
A well-known analogue of the Erdős–Ko–Rado Theorem for signed sets
was first stated by Meyer [22], and later proved by Deza and Frankl [10]
using the shifting technique, and by Bollobás and Leader [4] using Katona’s
elegant cycle method [20].
Definition 1.3. Let
n
o
W = W ∈ Sn,k,r : (1, 1) ∈ W .
Theorem 1.1 (Deza and Frankl [10]; Bollobás and Leader [4]). Let n, k, r ≥
1 be integers, n ≥ k. Let F ⊆ Sn,k,r be intersecting. Then


k−1 n − 1
= |W|.

|F | ≤ r
k−1
We should mention that there are several generalisations, extensions and
variations of Theorem 1.1; see for example [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 21].
Motivated by the afore-mentioned results we consider the following problem.
Problem 1. Find an injective proof of (1.3).
The object of this paper is to present the following theorem that provides
extensive solutions to Problem 1 leaving open only some cases when k ≤ n.
Theorem 1.2. There is an injective proof of (1.3) whenever r ≥ 2 and
k ≤ n/2.

The proof

One of the main tools in our proof is Katona’s Intersection Shadow Theorem.
For integers k > s ≥ 0 and a family F ⊆ [n]
, define its s-shadow ∂s (F ) by
k
 
o
n
[n]
: ∃F ∈ F , G ⊂ F .
∂s (F ) := G ∈
s

Suppose that F ⊆ [n]
such that |F ∩ F ′ | ≥ t ≥ 0 for all F, F ′ ∈ F .
s
Katona [19] then showed that
|∂s−t (F )| ≥ |F |.

(2.1)

Let mod∗ be the usual modulo operation except that for integers x and
y, (xy) mod∗ y is y instead of 0. Following Borg [5], for a signed sets A and
integers q and r, let θrq (A) be the shifting operation given by
θrq (A) = {(x, (a + q) mod∗ r) : (x, a) ∈ A},
and, for a family A of signed sets,
θrq (A) = {θrq (A) : A ∈ A}.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. The proof consists of a nearly straightforward combination of the arguments found in [7, 15]. Let A ⊆ Sn,k,r be intersecting, let
A0 = {A ∈ A : A ∩ {(1, 1), . . . , (1, r)} = ∅} and Ai = {A ∈ A : (1, i) ∈ A}
for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Note that A0 , . . . , Ar partition A. Let A′0 = A0 and
A′i = {A \ {(1,
Si)} : A ∈ Ai } for 1 ≤ i ≤ r.
Let A′ = ri=0 A′r . For A ∈ A′ , let MA = {x : (x, a) ∈ A}. We say that
MA represents A. Let M0 = {MA : A ∈ A′0 }, M1 = {MA : A ∈ A′ \ A′0 },
N = {[2, n] \ M : M ∈ M0 } and
n
o
B = (x1 , a1 ), . . . , (xk−1 , ak−1) : {x1 , . . . , xk−1 } ∈ ∂k−1 (N ), a1 , . . . , ak−1 ∈ [r] .
Claim 1. |A′0 | ≤ |B|.
Proof. Since A′0 is intersecting,
each set in M0 can represent at most r k−1 sets in A′0 .

(2.2)

Let N, N ′ ∈ N . Since 1 ≤ k ≤ n/2, we infer
|N ∩ N ′ | = |([2, n] \ M) ∩ ([2, n] \ M ′)| = n − 1 − 2k + |M ∩ M ′ | ≥ n − 2k ≥ 0,
so that applying (2.1) with s = n − 1 − k and t = n − 2k gives us
|M0| = |N | ≤ |∂k−1 (N )|.

(2.3)

Then (2.2) and (2.3) yield
|A′0| ≤ r k−1|M0 | ≤ r k−1|∂k−1 (N )| = |B|.
Claim 2. The families A′1 , θr1 (A′2 ), . . . , θrr−1 (A′r ), B are pairwise disjoint.
Proof. Since A is intersecting,
for i, j ∈ {0} ∪ [r] with i 6= j each set in A′i intersects each set in A′j . (2.4)
Suppose there exists B ∈ θri−1 (A′i )∩θrj−1 (A′j ) for some distinct i, j ∈ [2, r].
−(i−1)
−(j−1)
Let Ai = θr
(B) ∈ A′i and Aj = θr
(B) ∈ A′j . Then Ai ∩ Aj = ∅,
which contradicts (2.4). Similarly, if we suppose B ∈ A′1 ∩ θri−1 (A′i ) for
some i ∈ [2, r], then we get a contradiction to (2.4). Therefore, families
A′1 , θr1 (A′2 ), . . . , θrr−1 (A′r ) are pairwise disjoint. By (2.4), each set in M0 intersects each set in M1 . Therefore M1 ∩ ∂k−1 (N ) = ∅, which is to say
