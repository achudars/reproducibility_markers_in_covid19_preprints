Abstract. Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic is a potential cause of
carcinogenesis. It elicits its potential by generation of ROS, leading to DNA, protein
and lipid damage. Therefore, the deleterious effect of arsenic can be mitigated by
quenching ROS using antioxidants. There is a homology between the protein coding
regions of mice and human. Effect of these alterations in human can be mimicked in
mice. Therefore to understand the underlying mechanism of arsenic toxicity and its
amelioration by black tea, studies have been conducted in mice model. Long term
exposure to iAs leads to tumour growth, which has been found to be alleviated by
black tea. Observations reveal that black tea has two salutary effects on the growth
of tumour: the rate of growth of damaged cells was appreciably reduced and an early
saturation of the level of damage is achieved. To take the experimental findings further,
the experimental data have been modelled with simple dynamical equations. The

curves obtained from in vivo studies have been fitted with the data obtained from the
model. The corresponding steady states and their stabilities are analyzed.

1. Introduction
Arsenic, the 20th most abundant element in the earth’s crust [1] is found in nature in
two oxidation states i.e. +3 (arsenite) and +5 (arsenate). It is a metalloid, found in
both organic and inorganic forms. Arsenic is released into the ground water from rocks
containing copper or lead, either naturally or through intensive anthropogenic activities
like mining etc [2]. Humans may be exposed to As primarily from air, food and drinking
water [3]. Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) has a strong correlation with many
health hazards. More than 200 million people residing in 40 countries around the world
are exposed to dangerous levels of inorganic As (iAs) through ground water, the level
being much higher than the permissible limit of 10 µg/l [4]. In the Indian subcontinent,
at several places, arsenic levels of water range from 50-3200 mg/l [3].
Exposure to iAs leads to development of several diseases including cancer. Excessive
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by iAs is considered to be the main reason
behind the imbalance and disturbed homeostasis of individuals [5]. ROS causes damage
to DNA, protein and lipid and modulates expression [6] of several genes including those
implicated in cancer. Chronic arsenic exposure has also been reported to decrease the
activities of antioxidant enzymes which are required to counter the effect of free radicals
due to ROS generation [5].
Carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving initiation, promotion, progression and
finally metastasis. In order to check the deleterious effect of iAs, it is preferable to
halt the phenomenon of carcinogenesis at the initial stages itself. Chemoprevention
is the use of natural, synthetic, or biologic agents in order to reverse, suppress, or
prevent the progression of cancer [8]. Chemopreventive strategies to mitigate the
effect of iAs-induced toxicity using natural compounds is the need of the hour. Tea,
the most preferred beverage is a good antioxidant and has anticancer properties [7].
Owing to its antioxidant properties, black tea can counter the deleterious effects of ROS
generated due to iAs. To elucidate the role of black tea in the prevention of iAs-induced
carcinogenesis, studies have been initiated in Swiss Albino mice. Black tea can efficiently
quench generation of ROS, diminish DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, eliciting its
anti-carcinogenic potential.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
Preparation of Tea Extracts
1.25 gm of Assam tea and 1.25 gm of Darjeeling tea was mixed together and brewed
in 100 ml of freshly boiled water for 5 minutes. The liquor was then lyophilized using

Cell damage and mitigation in Swiss albino mice: experiment and modelling

a SCANVAC lyophilizer and stored. The lyophilized powder was then weighed and
reconstituted in water and administered to mice by gavage. The catechin and theaflavin
contents of the particular brand of green tea and black tea has been analysed by HPLC.
Dose was determined by epidemiological evidences and previous publications from our
lab [5]. Accordingly 100 µl of tea extract was administered to the mice.

Figure 1. Experimental datasets for the proportion of cell damage due to iAs (upper
curve). The lower curve is for the group that received both iAs and black tea. Note
the amelioration due to black tea, in limiting the extent of damage and causing an
early saturation.

2.2. Maintenance of animals
Normal, male, 4-5 week old Swiss albino mice (Mus Musculus) were selected from
an inbred colony maintained in the animal house of the Institute (IAEC 1774/MR3/2017/9). During the course of study the animals were fed on synthetic pellets specified
for mice-feed and had access to water ad libitum. They were maintained under standard
conditions with a 12 hour light and dark period and controlled room temperature
(22±2◦ C). The animals were sacrificed after euthanasia with thiopentone sodium in
overdose (100 mg/kg body wt.).
2.3. Treatment
The mice were divided in four groups namely I, II, III and IV. Group I: Control group,
where the mice were fed with normal food and tap water. Group II: Mice were fed with
black tea by gavage. Group III: Mice were given arsenic water (500 µg/l) for a period of
360 days. Group IV: Black tea (100 mg/ml, thrice daily) was administered to the mice

Cell damage and mitigation in Swiss albino mice: experiment and modelling

by gavage along with arsenic water (500 µg/ml) for the same period of duration. On
sacrificing the mice at different time intervals, blood and tissue samples were collected
and stored properly to perform the experiments. Two sets of data estimating the
damaged cells with time (up to about 360 days) were generated : one is only with
iAs and the other, with both iAs and black tea (for this group, the data were available
for about 330 days). No dataset for Group II is presented because no toxicity is found
due to the application of black tea. There were already some cell damage in the mice
and therefore the damage cell count does not start from zero at zero time. Fig. 1 shows
both these data: the application of black tea clearly brings down the cell damage and
leads to early saturation.
2.4. Estimation of ROS generation
Generation of Reactive Oxygen species was estimated in the blood of the mice according
to Balasubramanyam et al. [9] with slight modifications. Leukocytes were isolated from
blood using solution A (NH4 Cl dissolved in TRIS at pH 7.2) and Solution B (mesoinositol), then suspended in HBS (Hepes Buffered Saline pH 7.4). 10 mM 20 ,70 dichlorodihydro-fluorescein (DCFH-DA) was added and incubated for 45 minutes in the dark.
The fluorescent intensity of the DCF was recorded at 530 nm .
2.5. Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis
DNA damage was estimated by the Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE) or Comet
assay [10], using leukocytes isolated from blood. 20 µl of leukocytes suspended in 0.6%
Low melting agarose (LMA) and were layered over frosted slide pre-coated with 0.75%
Normal melting agarose (NMA). Cells were subjected to lysis by immersing them in
lysis buffer (2.5M NaCl, 0.1M Na2 EDTA, 10mM TRIS, 0.3M NaOH, 10%DMSO and 1%
TritonX; pH 10) for overnight at 4◦ C. Slides were then presoaked in electrophoresis buffer
(10mM NaOH, 0.2 m Na2 EDTA; pH>13) for 20 minutes and subsequently subjected
to electrophoresis for 25 minutes at 15V, 220mA. After staining with ethidium bromide
(EtBr), slides were viewed under a fluorescent microscope.
2.6. Lipid peroxidation assay
Damage to the cell membrane due to ROS generation was measured using the lipid
peroxidation assay following the principle of Okhawa et al. [11], with slight modifications.
The liver tissue of the sacrificed animals were collected and homogenized. 10% SDS,
20% acetic acid and 0.8% TBA was added to the tissue homogenate. It was then placed
in boiling water bath for 1 hour and then immediately transferred to ice for 10 minutes.
The samples were then centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was
collected and absorbance was measured at 535 nm. Lipid peroxidation was calculated
as the number of moles of MDA (Malondialdehyde) generated.

3. Model for growth of cell damage and mitigation
The dynamics of the effects of iAs and black tea on the colony of Swiss albino mice are
modelled by a set of simple mathematical equations. As mentioned above, we have two
datasets that represent the growth of damaged cells in the groups of mice studied, one
with only iAs (at 500 µg/l) and the other with tea (100 mg/ml, thrice daily), acting,
as it does, as a mitigating agent and iAs with the same dose as above. The extent of
cell damage is proportional to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). First
we ignore the effect of immunity and try to understand the effects of iAs and tea only.
The effects of immune cell response will be brought on in the next section. Our aim in
this and the following section is to try to model actual data that are obtained from our
experiment using standard mathematical models. There are excellent review articles on
such models and their merits and demerits (see, for example, Altrock, et al. [12] and
Pillis, et al., [13]). We do not, therefore, digress on these details here.
The dynamics of the damaged cells may be represented by the usual growth equation:
n
dn
= rn(1 − )
dt
K

(1)

N in the above equation is a measure of the damaged cells as interpreted from ROS
data. We define n = NN0 where N0 is the total number of cells at the beginning. Note
that one does not need to know the value of either N or N0 , only the ratio (percentage)
of damaged cells, represented by n, is needed for the model. There are two unknown
constants above, r and K = B/N0 , where B is the well-known ‘carrying capacity’.
Now iAs is administered at a constant rate daily from outside and is incorporated via
the term αAn in the above equation while the mitigating effects of tea is introduced via
the term βT n [14]. Then the overall equation for the cell growth is
dn
n
= rn(1 − ) + αAn − βT n
dt
K

(2)

The constants α and β are unknown, to be fitted from the data. The equations governing
the concentration of iAs and tea, A and T respectively, are similar [14]. In principle,
there could be additional effects, but in the minimal model we consider the effects of
iAs and tea require the two terms shown below:
dA
= A0 − γA A
dt

(3)

dT
= T0 − γT T
(4)
dt
Here A0 and T0 are the constant rate of administration of iAs and tea externally. Here
again, other effects of iAs and tea on the body could be added, which we will consider
in the future. One effect that is usually considered important, but we neglect here
(discussed in the next section), is the immune-surveillance. Usually, A0 and T0 , the
so-called dosage, are known in terms of mg (or ml)/day. However, to incorporate them

Cell damage and mitigation in Swiss albino mice: experiment and modelling

6

in the Eq. (2) above, one needs to know the concentration thereof at the cellular level,
which, at this moment, is not available to us. Therefore we leave them to fitting. For
the dataset with iAs only, the equation for tea is obviously redundant.
The expulsion of iAs and tea from the body is also accounted for via decay rates (rough
estimates of half-lives of elimination for these are available), γA and γT , from the body.
Note that different ingredients decay differently, depending also on the organ considered.
So some approximate values are chosen from literature [15], though a considerable degree
of latitude could not be ruled out.
Solving Eq. (3) and Eq. (4)
A(t) =

where, Ai = A(0) and Ti = T (0). Substituting the expressions of A(t) and T (t) in

prior presence of iAs and tea in the mice. Normal tap water which is given to the mice
is tested for the presence of iAs (by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)). The tap
water was found to be free of the metalloid. Although the presence of iAs at a very
small level in the body cannot be ruled out, but that is still negligible for the model.

Cell damage and mitigation in Swiss albino mice: experiment and modelling

The initial values of iAs and tea at time t = 0 i.e., Ai , Ti = 0. This implies p, s = 0. In
our case, γA = 0.04 day−1 and γT = 4 day−1 . We reiterate that these values are merely
approximations. Such rates depend on a large number of factors, primarily the organ
being considered, the method of administration and the measurement protocol. The
values used here are similar to Hughes et al. [15] Solving and fitting Eq. (7) numerically
to the given datasets, we obtain the values of the unknown coefficients as : r = 0.00524,
K = 0.14706, m = 0.01281 for the first dataset and r = 0.01380, K = 0.21644, m =
0.00792, q = 0.00041 for the second dataset. Note that for the first dataset, the effect
of black tea is not included. So, q is not relevant for the first dataset.
Fig. 2 shows the curves fitted to the given datasets, red and green dots represent
experimental data. The fitting appears to be excellent for both the curves. Note that
although iAs has a much longer half-life compared to black tea, the competition between
the damage by iAs and mitigation by tea is clear from the data and the model. The
saturation value and time for the curve with tea and iAs is considerably lower than the
upper curve with iAs alone. This is a redeeming feature from the experiment and the
model that the effect of tea is quite appreciable.
The fact that curves for iAs alone and iAs and tea together could both be fitted with
similar models gives confidence that the model could be used for further predictions.
One such prediction is that the damage appears to saturate in both cases, earlier with
tea. Such saturation would imply that the damage could be limited by the use of an
external mitigant like tea. We have neglected the effects of immunogenicity above, which
will abet early saturation. Although in the present paper we took the actual data and
modelled them, which makes modelling much more relevant, it is important to underline
the remit of data-fitting by mathematical equations : such exercises should be carried
out with due caution. In the absence of cellular level concentration of iAs and black tea,
and the inherent uncertainty and fluctuation in their values at the site, the results of
the model should be taken as indicative only. In addition, as we show below, the effect
of immune-cell response dramatically alters the model and make it closer to reality [16].
4. Growth model including the effect of immune cells
Let I(t) denote the number of immune cells at any instance of time t with a constant
influx rate of I0 and if the death rate of the immune cells be γI , the overall dynamics of
the system may be represented by the following equations :
n

The decay rates of iAs and black tea (γA and γT ) are given in the previous section. We
assume the constant influx rate of the immune cells I0 = 0.3 and the death rate of the
immune cells γI = 0.0208 day−1 [17, 18]. Eqs. (9) and (10) can be solved analytically
as given in Eqs. (5) and 6. Substituting the expressions of A(t) and T (t) in Eq. (8) as
before, we obtain

where, the unknown coefficients m (= αA

and c1 are to be fitted from the experimental data. We consider that initially at t =
0, no iAs, tea and immune cells are present. This implies Ai , Ti = 0. Therefore, the
coefficients p, s = 0.
Numerically solving Eqs. (11) and (12) and after fitting to the experimental datasets,
we obtained the values of the unknown coefficients as : r = 0.00173, K = 0.03166, m
= 0.02802,  = 0.00055, ρ = 0.95103, α1 = 1.30187, c1 = 0.63433 for the first dataset
and r = 0.60516, K = 8.97523, m = 0.08006, q = 0.61760,  = 0.00379, ρ = 0.02733,
α1 = 2.15877, c1 = 0.02718 for the second dataset. For the first dataset, the coefficients
are calculated without considering the effect of black tea. The fitted curves are given in
Fig. 3 along with the experimental datasets, which are shown by the orange and blue
dots. The existence and uniqueness of the solutions are discussed in the Appendix.

4.1. Equilibrium points
4.1.1. Tea-free equilibria In order to study the equilibrium solutions, we first consider
the case without tea. We look for the steady state solutions:
ṅ = 0
Ȧ = 0
I˙ = 0
For experimental relevance, we look for the non-zero solution for n only. The three Eqs.
above generate three null surfaces, the intersection of which give the equilibrium point
(n∗ , A∗ , I ∗ ). The non-trivial solutions are :

Although the trivial equilibrium (no-tumour) n∗ = 0 is studied for the sake of
completeness by other authors [16], it does not correspond to any relevant experimental
outcome. Therefore we neglect the trivial point. In Fig. 4, we plot the three nullsurfaces given by Eqs. (13−15) using the values of the coefficients, as obtained from
the fit. Solving Eqs. (13) and (15) numerically and using the obtained values of the
coefficients, we find that equilibrium occurs at the point (A∗ , I ∗ , n∗ ) = (10, 4.010730,
0.502892), where we consider the constant influx rate of iAs is fixed at A0 = 0.4. Once
the non-trivial points of equilibrium are obtained, we study their linear stability. In
order to ensure the positivity of equilibria, we need r + αA∗ > I ∗ and ρ > c1 α1 + γI .

we get λ± < 0. Since λ1 is already negative, it corresponds to stable equilibrium.

Again we have to look for the regions where λ± < 0. In Fig. 5, we show the three nullsurfaces given by Eqs. (18−21) using the values of the coefficients, as obtained from
the fit; the upper one is plotted keeping A fixed at A∗ = 10. In the lower one, the
null-surfaces are plotted keeping T fixed at T ∗ = 0.1. The equilibrium points (T ∗ , I ∗ ,
n∗ ) and (A∗ , I ∗ , n∗ ) are the intersections of these surfaces. Our calculations show that
equilibrium occurs at the point (A∗ , T ∗ , I ∗ , n∗ ) = (10, 0.1, 11.48990, 0.35624), where
the constant influx rates of iAs and black tea are kept fixed at A0 , T0 = 0.4. When we
substitute these values of n∗ , A∗ , T ∗ and I ∗ in Eq. (22), we find that λ± < 0. Since the
other two eigenvalues are already negative, this implies that the values of the coefficients
obtained from the fit actually lead to a stable equilibrium.
4.2. Model with delay
The immune response in any living organism is usually a delayed process and therefore
it is natural to assume a delay in I(t) in the functional response term. In this situation,

equilibrium solutions. It is to note that the set of equilibria are the same for this system

We use the following stability criteria for a nonlinear delay equation from [19].

Theorem 1 The necessary and sufficient conditions for an equilibrium to be
asymptotically stable for all τ ≥ 0 are the following: (1) The real part of the roots
of ∆(λ, 0) = 0 is negative.
(2) For all real µ and all τ ≥ 0, ∆(iµ, τ ) 6= 0.
One eigenvalue is of course −γA and others are given by the root of the following equation
(L∗ − λ)(P1∗ + P2∗ e−λτ − λ) + n∗ M ∗ = 0.
Simplifying, we get
λ2 + (−L∗ − P1∗ − P2∗ e−λτ )λ + L∗ (P1∗ + P2∗ e−λτ ) + n∗ M ∗ = 0.
We have already obtained condition for non delay case. To examine the other condition,
let us substitute λ = iµ in the above equation,
−µ2 + (−L∗ − P1∗ − P2∗ e−iµτ )iµ + L∗ (P1∗ + P2∗ e−iµτ ) + n∗ M ∗ = 0.
Separating real and imaginary part, we obtain
−µ2 − P2∗ sin(µτ )µ + P2∗ cos(µτ ) + n∗ M ∗ = 0
−L∗ − P2∗ cos(µτ )µ − P2∗ sin(µτ )

= 0.

Squaring and adding, we get
(n∗ M ∗ − µ2 )2 + L∗ 2 = P2∗ 2 µ2 + P2∗ 2 ,
which further implies
µ4 − ((P2∗ )2 + 2n∗ M ∗ )µ2 + 2 n∗ 2 M ∗ 2 + L∗ 2 − P2∗ 2 = 0.

So condition (2) of theorem violates implies that there exists a µ such that the above
relation holds. It holds if 2 n∗ 2 M ∗ 2 +L∗ 2 > P2∗ 2 , so the equilibrium is stable if in addition
to the condition for non-delay case (subsection 4.1.2), we have 2 n∗ 2 M ∗ 2 + L∗ 2 < P2∗ 2 .
Remark 1 Stability of Equilibrium with Tea : In this case, since the equation in I
does not depend on T, we get the same condition for stability 2 n∗ 2 M ∗ 2 + L∗ 2 < P2∗ 2 in
addition to the condition given in subsection (4.1.4).
5. Conclusion
An attempt has been made to model the data obtained from the in vivo studies, using
Swiss albino mice. Mice are maintained under the influence of iAs for a long period, with
iAs-loaded water as the only source of drinking water. Black tea infusion is administered
on a regular basis to a subset of the mice. The data obtained on the cell-damage in
these two groups of mice were then modelled by the standard dynamical equations.
It is redeeming to note that even simple models could fit the data well and predict
long-term behaviour of the cell damage by iAs and its alleviation by black tea. Further
studies using experimentally obtained fitting parameters would reveal more interesting
underlying dynamics that are testable in real systems. The predictions thereof would
be reliable and useful for the study of growth and limitation of tumours.
Appendix
We discuss the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the dynamical equations
considered in the text above.
Appendix A. Existence and uniqueness of the solution
We consider the immune-free case (Eq. 7) first. The case with immunity will follow
similarly. The problem can be written as
dy
= f (t, y), y(0) = y0 , t ∈ [t0 , t0 + T ],
dt
where f (t, y) = ry(1 − Ky ) + my(1 − e−γA t ) + pye−γA t − qy(1 − e−γT t ) − sye−γT t . Since we
are interested in only positive solutions, hence we assume the positivity of the solution
when y0 is positive. By using bounds of exponentials, we obtain
dy
y
≤ ry(1 − ) + my + py

Hence, we obtain lim inf t→∞ y(t) ≥ K(r−q−s)
:= m. Since all coefficients are positive,
r
hence if y0 is positive, the solution remains positive in this case. So, we have achieved
the bounds and positivity of the solution. In order to ensure the existence and uniqueness
of solution, we need to check the Lipschitz condition. Suppose y1 , y2 ∈ R, we have
|f (t, y1 ) − f (t, y2 )|
y1
y2
≤ r|y1 (1 − ) − y2 (1 − )| + m(1 − e−γA t )|y1 − y2 |

K
2M r

(A.3)

Hence f is Lipschitz with respect to y. It is easy to see that f is continuous with respect
to t. So, we can apply Picard theorem to ensure the existence and uniqueness of solution.
Next, we discuss the existence and uniqueness of the solution for Eqs. (8)−(11).
One can convert this system of Eqs. in vector from by defining X = (n, A, T, I)t :
dX
= F̂ (X) = AX + F (X), where

It is straightforward to check that the function F is Lipschitz by assuming the
boundedness, i.e. there exists a constant L such that
kF (X1 ) − F (X2 )k ≤ LF kX1 − X2 k

Also, continuity with respect to t is evident since the F ∗ does not depend on t. Hence,
the existence and uniqueness of the solution is guaranteed by Picard-Lindeloff theorem.
