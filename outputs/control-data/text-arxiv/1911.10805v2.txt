Abstract
We study nuclear electric dipole moments induced by ∆F = 1 effective operators
in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Such contributions arise through renormalization group evolutions and matching conditions at the electroweak symmetry
breaking scale. We provide one-loop formulae for the matching conditions. We also
discuss correlations of these effects with ∆F = 2 observables such as K and ∆MBd .

Introduction

Since we have not discovered new particles at the LHC experiment [1], physics beyond the
standard model (SM) is very likely to exist in high energy scale, particularly above the
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) scale. Such a high scale can be probed indirectly
through flavor and CP violations. In particular, electric dipole moments (EDMs), which are
CP -violating observables, are one of the most sensitive observables. Currently, an experimental bound on the EDM of the 199 Hg atom is provided as [2, 3]
|dHg | < 6.3 × 10−30 e cm,

(1.1)

at the 90% confidence level. Although theoretical calculations suffer from uncertainties
in estimating the Schiff moment, it can constrain NP very severely. For the nucleon, the
experimental bound of the neutron is [4]
|dn | < 3.0 × 10−26 e cm,

(1.2)

at the 90% confidence level. On the other hand, the indirect limit on the proton EDM is
derived from 199 Hg as [5]
|dp | < 2.1 × 10−25 e cm.

(1.3)

In future, several experiments aim to improve the sensitivity by two orders of magnitudes for
the neutron EDM [6, 7]. Also, a storage ring experiment is projected to measure the proton
EDM at the level of 10−29 e cm [8].
Although the EDMs are flavor-conserving observables, flavor-violating interactions can
contribute to them. In the SM, the W -boson interactions change quark flavors. Thus, a
class of NP can induce EDMs through quark flavor-changing interactions by exchanging the
W boson. Such contributions are represented by the Standard Model Effective Field Theory
(SMEFT) [9–11]. Here, all the SM particles including the electroweak bosons (W, Z, H)
and the top quark (t) are retained. Above the EWSB, NP contributions to flavor and CP
violations are encoded in higher dimensional operators in the SMEFT. At the EWSB scale,
they are matched onto the effective operators in the low-scale effective field theory (LEFT)
by integrating out W , Z, H and t. Low-scale observables such as the EDMs are evaluated
by using the LEFT.
In this letter, we study the nuclear EDMs from SMEFT flavor-changing operators. They
are induced by ∆F = 1 operators through radiative corrections of the W boson. In particular, we will focus on top-quark loop contributions, because they tend to be large due to
the large top quark mass (cf. Ref. [12]). The radiative corrections are taken into account by
solving the renormalization group equations (RGEs) in the SMEFT [13–15]. In addition, the
SMEFT operators are matched onto those in the LEFT at the EWSB scale. The one-loop
matching conditions are necessary, because the contributions of the ∆F = 1 operators to
EDMs are induced by radiative corrections. The one-loop formulae will be provided in this
letter. Theses operators also contribute to ∆F = 2 observables such as K and ∆Md through
the W -boson loops. Since these observables are sensitive to NP contributions, we will discuss
correlation between the contributions to the EDMs and the ∆F = 2 observables.

Formula

In this section, we provide formulae for evaluating the EDMs induced by flavor-changing
operators. By decoupling NP particles, their contributions are encoded in higher dimensional operators in the SMEFT. Then, these operators are evolved by following the RGEs.
Anomalous dimensions in the SMEFT are provided at the one-loop level in Refs. [13–15], and
those relevant for the CP and flavor violations are summarized in Ref. [12]. At the EWSB
scale, they are matched to the LEFT operators. We provide the one-loop matching formulae
between the SMEFT ∆F = 1 operators and the LEFT ∆F = 0 CP -violating operators.
In the SMEFT, the ∆F = 1 effects are encoded into higher dimensional operators, which
are defined as [10]

where the first term in the right-hand side is the SM Lagrangian, and the second term
represents the higher dimensional operators. Here, the Lagrangian is invariant under the
SM gauge symmetry, and all the SM particles including W, Z, H and t are dynamical. In
this letter, we consider the operators of the down-type quarks,#1 which correlate with ∆F = 2
observables, such as K and ∆MBb . The dimension-six operators which potentially relevant
to the EDMs and the ∆F = 2 observables are shown as#2

We follow the analysis in Ref. [12], where the SMEFT RGEs and the matching formulae at
the one-loop level are provided.
Below the EWSB scale, the LEFT ∆F = 0, 2 operators are evolved by the RGEs. Then,
the low-scale observables are evaluated around the hadron scale.

Observables

In this section, low-scale observables are summarized. We consider the EDMs, K and ∆MBd .
All of them are very sensitive to NP contributions to CP violations.

3.1

Nuclear EDMs

The CP -violating operators of the down-type quarks induce the nuclear EDMs.#4 Then,
hadronic matrix elements are necessary to evaluate their contributions. There are many types
of the SMEFT four-quark operators. Contributions of Õ1ds and Õ1sd are evaluated by the effective chiral Lagrangian technique [28]. Those operators generate CP -violating baryon-meson
interactions through vacuum-expectation values (VEVs) of pseudoscalar mesons. Then, the
199
Hg EDM is induced at the tree level as [29]

hereafter, we set θ̄ = 0 for simplicity#6 . The derivations of Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3) are given in
Appendix A.
#4

In the analysis, CP -violating baryon-meson interactions are considered to discuss the nuclear EDMs
(see Appendix A). They can also induce the electron EDM, e.g., via the Barr-Zee diagram, which will be
explored in future.
#5
The nucleon EDMs are also induced by baryon-meson diagrams at the tree level [29]. However, we
confirmed that they are sub-dominant.
#6
The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism is not assumed for realizing θ̄ = 0. It is straightforward to extend
the case for θ̄ 6= 0. Then, the PQ mechanism is introduced to avoid the strong CP problem. The following
conclusions do not change qualitatively.

Four-quark operators, Õdb and Õbd , involve the bottom quark. In order to derive their
contributions to the neutron and proton EDMs, we follow the strategy explored in Refs. [30–
32]. The result becomes

where the Wilson coefficients are estimated at the hadron scale, µ = 1 GeV. Here, the
contribution to the proton EDM, (3.5), is derived by multiplying a ratio of the magnetic
moments, µp /µn , to that of the neutron EDM, (3.4) (cf., Ref. [32]). On the other hand, Õsb
and Õbs are much less constrained by the EDMs, because they do not depend on the down
quark.
Let us summarize the current experimental limits and future prospects. The current
bounds are obtained as [2–5]
|dHg | < 6.3 × 10−30 e cm,
|dn | < 3.0 × 10−26 e cm,
|dp | < 2.1 × 10−25 e cm.

[90% C.L.]
[90% C.L.]

(3.6)
(3.7)
(3.8)

In future, experiments are projected to achieve the sensitivities of |dn | ∼ 10−28 e cm [6] and
|dp | ∼ 10−29 e cm [8]. Although the 199 Hg EDM constraint is the strongest at this moment,
the neutron/proton EDMs can provide severer bound by the future experiments.
Before closing this section, let us comment on contributions to the electric and chromoelectric dipole moments, O1i and O2i . As mentioned in the previous section, the SMEFT
ij
∆F = 1 operators contribute only to the LEFT four-quark operators, Õ1,2
. Below the EWSB
i
scale, they induce O1,2 through radiative corrections. However, according to the RGEs in
the LEFT, their contributions appear as linear combinations of C̃1ij + C̃1ji and C̃2ij + C̃2ji as
Cai = αa (C̃1ij + C̃1ji ) + βa (C̃2ij + C̃2ji ),

(3.9)

i
for O1,2
with a = 1, 2 and coefficients αa , βa . By substituting the SMEFT contributions into
ij
C̃1,2 in the right-hand side, all the contributions are found to vanish (see Eqs. (2.25)–(2.28)).
Consequently, the SMEFT ∆F = 1 operators do not generate the electric or chromoelectric dipole moment. Hence, we will study the nuclear EDMs directly from the four-quark
operators.

3.2

∆F = 2 observables

The ∆F = 2 operators contribute to the oscillations of the neutral mesons. In particular, the
indirect CP violation of the neutral K mesons, K , and the mass difference of the neutral
Bq mesons are sensitive to NP contributions. The former is sensitive to flavor violations

|exp

Next, flavor violations including the bottom quark are constrained by the oscillations of
the neutral Bq mesons. In particular, those between the first and third generations contribute
to ∆MBd . The SM and NP contributions are represented as

∆MdSM = (4.21 ± 0.34) × 10−13 GeV.

(3.16)

The Wilson coefficients are evaluated with the NLO-QCD RGEs [37], and hadron matrix
elements in Ref. [39] are used. On the other hand, the experimental result is obtained as [36]
∆Mdexp = (3.3338 ± 0.0125) × 10−13 GeV.

(3.17)

Thus, the NP contribution is required to satisfy,
0.20 × 10−13 < ∆MdNP < 1.56 × 10−13 ,

(3.18)

at the 2σ level. Finally, although ∆MBs gives a constraint on flavor violations between the
second and third generations, the bound from the EDMs is very weak (see Eq. (3.4)). Hence,
we do not consider them in this letter.

Numerical analysis

In this section, we study contributions of the SMEFT ∆F = 1 operators to the nuclear
EDMs and ∆F = 2 observables, K and ∆MBd . In Fig. 1, the neutron, proton and 199 Hg
2
EDMs are estimated. On each line, one of the Wilson coefficients is set to be Ci = i/MNP
at
the NP scale, MNP . The other coefficients are zero. The effective operators missing in the
list do not contribute to the EDMs as well as the ∆F = 2 observables.#7 Once the operator
is set, the RGEs are solved, and the matching conditions are taken into account. In the top
and bottom panels, the four-quark operators mix the first two generations of the down-type
quark. On the other hand, the operators in the middle panels include the bottom quark. In
low MNP regions, it is found that the EDMs are suppressed, where the loop functions, I1
and K, vanish.
For the plots of the neutron and proton EDMs, the horizontal red and blue dotted lines
correspond to the current experimental bound and the future sensitivity, respectively. For
the latter, we quote |dn | = 10−28 e cm and |dp | = 10−29 e cm. Currently, the neutron EDM
(1,8)
(1)
excludes MNP . 100 GeV of (Cud )3312 and (Cqd )3312 . On the other hand, the severest
constraint is provided by the 199 Hg EDM; the current experimental bound is shown by
the horizontal purple dotted line in the bottom plot of Fig. 1. It is found that the NP
contributions have already been excluded for MNP . 1–9 TeV. The sensitivities of the
neutron/proton EDMs are expected to be improved greatly. They can probe the NP scale
up to 2–10 TeV, which are beyond the limit of the 199 Hg EDM.
The contributions to the nuclear EDMs are suppressed for the operators including the
bottom quark. This is because the hadron matrix elements of such operators are small (see
Eq. (3.4)). Currently, the constraint is weaker than MNP . 100 GeV according to the middle
panels of the figure, and the sensitivity may reach at most 3 TeV in future.
Let us study correlations between the EDMs and the ∆F = 2 observables. The results
(1,8)
(1,8)
depend on the SMEFT operators. The ∆S = 1 operators of (Cqd )3312 , (Cud )3312 and
(CHd )12 contribute to the EDMs and K via radiative corrections. Similarly, the ∆B = 1
(1,8)
(1,8)
operators of (Cqd )3313 , (Cud )3313 and (CHd )13 affect ∆MBd as well as the EDMs. In
Figs. 2–4, the EDMs and the ∆F = 2 observables are estimated for each operator. Here,
the real and imaginary parts of each Wilson coefficient are varied at the NP scale of 1 TeV,
while the other coefficients are set to be zero at this scale. In the plots, the current limits
from K and ∆MBd are drawn by the blue band, where the region inside the band is allowed
at the 2σ level. On the other hand, contours of the neutron, proton and 199 Hg EDMs are
shown by the bands with different colors.
From the figures, it is noticed that the 199 Hg EDM gives a bound on the ∆S = 1
operators, and the proton EDM can provide a better sensitivity for them. For some of the
(8)
(8)
∆B = 1 operators especially (Cqd )3313 and (Cud )3313 , future measurements of the proton
EDMs will also be able to compete with the constraint from ∆MBd . We want to emphasize
that the parameter dependence of the EDMs is different from that of K . Thus, the NP
#7

There are operators which can contribute to the EDMs through self-energy corrections. The matching
conditions are provided in Section 2, and it is straightforward to analyze them.

contributions to the effective operators can be specified by combining the EDMs with the
flavor observables.
(1,3)
(1,8)
(1)
Next, let us consider Cqq , Cqu , and (CHq )12,13 . We found that they do not contribute
to the EDMs because of the Lorentz structures of these operators. In fact, they generate only
the vector-type operators of the four quarks below the EWSB scale, which do not violate
the CP symmetry.
(3)
Similarly, the operators of (CHq )12,13 do not contribute to the EDMs through the fourquark operators. Let us consider another contribution. It is noticed that these operators
include W boson interactions by taking the Higgs VEV as

in the Feynman-’t Hooft gauge, where G± is the NG bosons. Here, all the quark fields are
left-handed in these interactions. Then, they seem to generate the electric and chromoelectric
dipole moments through penguin diagrams of the W boson loops. However, it can be checked
that such contributions vanish by paying attention to the chirality structure of the quark.
(3)
Hence, the operators of (CHq )12,13 do not contribute to the nucleon EDMs.
Finally, let us comment on Cdd . This operator can also contribute to the EDMs through
the RGEs and matching conditions. However, these contributions are found to be very small,
and we do not discuss them anymore.

Conclusions

We studied the nuclear EDMs induced by the SMEFT ∆F = 1 operators and their correlations with the ∆F = 2 observables. These SMEFT operators contribute to them through
the W boson loops. The radiative corrections via the RGEs and the matching conditions at
the EWSB scale are taken into account. In particular, we provide the one-loop formulae of
the matching conditions for the EDMs.
It was found that some of the operators are already excluded for MNP . 1–9 GeV by
the 199 Hg EDM, and future experiments for the proton EDM may be able to probe those in
MNP . 2–10 TeV. Compared with K and ∆MBd , it was shown that the nuclear EDMs can
provide a complementary information on the ∆F = 1 effective operators in future.
Other nuclear EDMs such as 129 Xe and 225 Ra can also be sensitive to the CP -violating
baryon-meson interactions. Although the current bounds are weaker than that of 199 Hg, they
would be examined better in future experiments (see e.g., Ref. [6]). Although their theoretical
calculations suffer from potentially large uncertainties in estimating the the Schiff moment,
it is interesting to study future sensitivities to the SMEFT ∆F = 1 operators, which will be
explored elsewhere.

Note added: while we are submitting this letter, a new article [40] was published on
arXiv; the authors argued that an enhancement factor coming from the strange quark mass
which was mentioned in Ref. [41] and is quoted in Eq. (A.21) disappears. Since this factor
can induce a large contribution to the neutron and proton EDMs, the numerical analysis in
this article may be affected.

Estimation of neutron and proton EDMs

In this section, let us explain how to estimate the contributions of the four-quark operators
to the neutron and proton EDMs with the chiral Lagrangian technique [28]. In particular,
we follow the analysis explored in Ref. [41].
We consider the neutron and proton
EDMs through meson condensations induced by the

as

By adopting this symmetry in the meson chiral Lagrangian, the CP -violating terms are
written at O(p2 ) as

Figure 1. The neutron and proton EDMs are estimated for the SMEFT ∆F = 1 operators of the
down and strange quarks with the top quarks in the top panels. Those for the down and bottom
quarks are shown in the middle panels. The red and blue dotted lines are the current experimental
limit and the future sensitivity. Also, the 199 Hg EDM for the down and strange quarks are in the
bottom panel. The purple dotted line is the current experimental limit. The Wilson coefficients
2 at the NP scale M
are i/MNP
NP .

Figure 2. Contours of the EDMs and K (left) and ∆MBd (right). Outside regions of the purple
band are excluded by the 199 Hg EDM, and those of the red and light green bands are probed by
the future experiment in the left panel. On the other hand, the deep green region in the right panel
corresponds to |dn | < 10−29 e cm, which is below the future sensitivity. In the left panel, the blue
region is allowed by K at the 2σ level, and the region in the right panel is allowed by ∆MBd at
the 2σ level.
