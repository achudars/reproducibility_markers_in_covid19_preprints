We propose a mechanism of elementary thermal dark matter with mass up to 1014 GeV, within a
standard cosmological history, whose relic abundance is determined solely by its interactions with the
Standard Model, without violating the perturbative unitarity bound. The dark matter consists of
many nearly degenerate particles which scatter with the Standard Model bath in a nearest-neighbor
chain, and maintain chemical equilibrium with the Standard Model bath by in-equilibrium decays
and inverse decays. The phenomenology includes super heavy elementary dark matter and heavy
relics that decay at various epochs in the cosmological history, with implications for CMB, structure
formation and cosmic ray experiments.

INTRODUCTION

One of the biggest questions in fundamental physics
is the nature of dark matter (DM). The possibility that
DM is a thermal Weakly Interacting Massive Particle
(WIMP), whose abundance is determined by 2 → 2 annihilations into Standard Model (SM) bath particles, is
exciting, but has alluded detection thus far. The WIMP
is particularly intriguing because it is very predictive—
its abundance is determined only by its interactions with
the SM, which informs us how it may be detected.
The WIMP paradigm has been a guide towards the
properties of DM, such as its mass and interactions. In
particular, within the WIMP freezeout mechanism, there
is a an upper bound on the DM mass from perturbative unitarity, of O(100) TeV [1]. The reason is that the
WIMP annihilation rate is proportional to an exponentially decreasing DM density, and so the amount of dark
matter that can be annihilated away before freezeout is
limited by the theoretical size of the cross-section.
Of course, DM may be much heavier than this bound,
if it is not a WIMP. Such models include non-thermal
dynamics, decoupled dark sectors, inflationary and gravitational production, nonstandard cosmological histories,
and large entropy production [2–20]. In none of these
cases, however, is the DM abundance solely determined
by its interactions with the SM. The common lore is that
an elementary DM candidate that is thermally coupled to
the SM, within a standard cosmological history, cannot
have mass well above the WIMP perturbative unitarity
bound. Exceptions include composite DM, but still do
not go much beyond the above bound [21–23].
In this Letter we present a new freezeout mechanism
within a standard cosmological history. The DM is an
elementary particle that is thermalized with the SM at
high temperatures, its relic abundance is determined via
its freezeout from the SM bath, and the DM mass can be
as high as 1014 GeV for s-wave processes, without violating the perturbative unitarity limit. In future work, we
show how Planck-scale DM can be reached for velocity-

dependent processes [24].
The general idea is as follows. The dark matter consists of N approximately degenerate states, χi (i = 1..N ).
These states co-scatter [25] off of the SM bath, but only
in a chain of nearest-neighbor interactions
χi + sm ↔ χi+1 + sm,

(1)

while the N th state co-decays [26–31] in equilibrium with
the SM,
χN → sm + sm .

(2)

Here χ1 is the DM candidate. This setup is summarized in Fig. 1. The processes in Eq. (1) can maintain chemical equilibrium much longer than annihilations can, because the interaction rate for the scattering
Γsctr = nSM hσvisctr never becomes exponentially suppressed. The in-equilibrium decay allows for the whole
system to have vanishing chemical potential for a long
time—if the N th particle was annihilating with the bath,
the system would inherit the unitarity bound from coannihilations. Finally, the chain, which will typically require N > 5 − 20, depending on the DM mass, ensures
the stability of the DM χ1 .

GENERAL IDEA

Consider a DM particle χ1 , whose density changes via
scattering with a light SM bath particle,
χ1 + sm ↔ χ2 + sm,

(3)

where χ2 has similar mass to χ1 . This process can maintain chemical equilibrium much longer than annihilations
with the same interaction strength, because the interaction rate for the scattering does not depend on the DM
density, and therefore the rate does not become exponentially suppressed. The DM is able to maintain equilibrium to smaller temperatures, becoming more Boltzmann

suppressed than a WIMP for the same size cross-section.
However, χ1 can only reduce exponentially for as long
as χ2 reduces exponentially (for instance, by maintaining
chemical equilibrium with the SM bath). Thus in order
to go beyond the unitarity bound on annihilations, some
other process is still needed to reduce the χ2 density. If
this process is annihilations (such as χ2 +χ2 ↔ sm+sm),
then it will freezeout too early, and the unitarity bound
on annihilations will apply again. If instead, χ2 decays equilibrium with the SM bath, chemical equilibrium
can be maintained for much longer. Thus, our proposed
mechanism is a combination of co-decay and co-scattering
dark matter.
However, one can easily see that the combination of the
scattering process Eq. (3), and the in-equilibrium decay
process χ2 → sm + sm, will necessarily lead to the fast
decay of χ1 via an off-shell χ2 . In the presence of a coscattering chain, such that scatters take place only for
nearest neighbors

χN → sm + sm .

ṅ2 + 3Hn2 = nsm hσvi(n1 − n2 ) − (n2 − neq
2 )Γ2 , (7)
where hσvi is a thermally averaged cross section for the
scattering process, neq is the equilibrium number density
of χ, and Γ2 is the decay rate of χ2 in the thermal bath.
This system is similar to the co-scattering scenario [25],
but here the DM bath is kept in equilibrium with the SM
bath via decays and inverse-decays, rather than annihilations. Ultimately, since decays and inverse-decays can
stay in equilibrium much longer, this will allow for much
heavier DM.
Unlike the case for freezeout via annihilations, the instantaneous freezeout approximation will not give a good
estimate of the relic abundance. This is because the rate
for χ1 scattering, Γ ∼ nsm hσvi, is not dropping off exponentially fast with the expansion, and therefore freezeout
takes a long time. However, an approximate analytic solution to the relic abundance can still be determined from
the Boltzmann equations, as we now detail.
If the decay rate Γ2 is larger than the Hubble expansion parameter when the temperature T of the universe is
equal to the DM mass, the number density of χ2 closely
follows its equilibrium value. An approximate solution
to the χ1 density can then be found by considering the
single equation
Y10 =

Y1 (∞) ≈

TWO PARTICLE CASE

As a toy example, we first work through the simplest
case of N = 2 dark matter particles with mass m. While
this example is not cosmologically viable, it demonstrates
the basic idea of the mechanism. Consider two degenerate
states χ1 and χ2 , which co-scatter [25] off of SM bath
particles via the process
(6)

The dark matter candidate is χ1 , while χ2 decays in equilibrium with the SM bath.

where Yi = ni /s with s the entropy density, x = m/T and
λ = (nsm hσvi/H)|x=1 . We have also assumed that the
thermally averaged cross-section is velocity independent
and took the number of relativistic degrees of freedom
g? = g?s to be constant. The asymptotic value of the
relic abundance is

χ1 can instead be long lived; here χ1 is still the DM,
but its decay width is suppressed due to the large phase
space needed to decay to the SM (χ1 decays to 2N SM
particles). This is summarized in Fig. 1.

From the Boltzmann equation (8), χ1 departs equilibrium when λ/x2fo ∼ 1. The fact that the relic abundance
then scales as Y1 (∞) ∼ e−2xfo and not as e−xfo (as one
finds in the instantaneous freezeout approximation), is
the result of the slow freezeout. At this point χ1 creation
stops, but χ1 can continue to scatter away. Neglecting
the inverse process, solving

yields that Y1 (x) = Y1 (xfo )e x xfo → e−2xfo . One also sees
from this solution that the abundance stops changing significantly when xfin ∼ λ = x2fo .
From the above estimation, one can find hσvi that reproduces the observed relic abundance of dark matter,

while satisfying the unitarity bound. For instance, parameterizing the cross-section as hσvi ≡ α2 /m2χ , one finds
that for α ' 1, mχ = 6 × 1014 GeV reproduces the correct relic abundance (assuming the DM scatters off of 4
SM degrees of freedom and that g?s = 106.75).

N > 2 DEGENERATE CASE

Although the simplest N = 2 example does not work,
it indicates a clear path forward to a viable setup: suppressing the decay rate of χ1 . We thus consider N > 2
particles with the same type of nearest-neighbor interactions as before. Similarly, we assume that only χN is able
to decay into SM particles, that the masses are degenerate, and that the cross section for each interaction is the
same. The equations of the system are

time variation of g? and g?s , and assume that the cross
section is constant in the non-relativistic limit. Note also
that we are interested in parameter space where λ, λd

This system can be solved in similar fashion to the
N = 2 case, by assuming YN = Yeq and diagonalizing the
differential equations. However, we can more simply obtain a solution with the new N scaling by taking the large
N limit, and taking flavor space to be continuous. For

Yπ/2 (τ ) = Y eq (τ )

From the form of the diffusion equation, we see that
the system depends on the cross-section only through the
combination D ' π 2 λ/4N 2 . From solving the boundary
conditions, the asymptotic profile Y` (∞) ∝ cos `. The solution of the diffusion equations gives the relic abundance

In Fig. 2 we plot the yield of the χi particles for N = 10,
solving the full Boltzmann equations, Eqs. (11). We find
that the relic abundances match the analytical estimate
of Eq. (14).
Now, one must check that χ1 is sufficiently long lived to
be a viable DM candidate. A model-independent bound
on the DM lifetime is τ > 5 × 1018 sec [32] (for earlier
studies, see Refs. [33–44]). However, if the DM decays
to SM particles, constraints on the lifetime may be much
stronger, τ > 1027 sec (see e.g. Refs. [45–47]).
The decay of χ1 to SM particles takes place only
through N −1 off-shell χi particles, into 2N SM particles,

The second important effect of the mass splitting is
that the heavier states can quickly cascade decay to the
lightest state (which is still very long lived). Depending
on the size of the mass-splitting, the decays may be in- or
out-of-equilibrium. If the decays are in-equilibrium, the
calculation of the relic-abundance will mostly remain unchanged. If the decays are out of equilibrium, the heavier
states will simply transfer their abundances to the lightest
state, increasing the DM abundance by a factor O(N ).

The colored solid lines depict the minimal number of particles
when χ1 decays through the chain (see Eq. 18), while the
gray solid lines depict the same within an explicit model (see
Eq. 25). For both, we require that τ1 > 1027 sec. The purple

while the green line corresponds to a pair of N identical SM
particles in the final state. The dashed lines are contours of

N . For instance, assuming that the DM decays to 2N
identical SM particles corresponding to S = (2N )!, we
find for m = 107 GeV that N ≥ 5, and for m = 1013 GeV
that N ≥ 14. In Fig. 3, we plot the minimum value of N
as a function of mχ , satisfying the lifetime requirement.

NON-DEGENERATE MASSES AND COUPLINGS

Up until now, we have considered the case of exactly degenerate masses, but it is natural to consider small mass
splittings between the particles. This will have two important effects: creating forbidden channels and allowing
the heavier states to decay directly into the lighter states.
In standard two-particle forbidden annihilations, the
mass splitting is negligible if it is smaller than the temperature when the abundance is still evolving, i.e., δm/m <
x−1
fo . For the chain interactions, a similar condition is
found:
2
2 −1
(mmax − mmin )/mmin < x−1
,
fin = (π λ/4N )

(19)

where mmax and mmin is the maximum and minimum
particle mass in the chain.
If the mass splitting is larger than this, then the evolution will enter a forbidden regime. The abundance of
the lightest particle (the DM candidate) decouples when
the Boltzmann suppression factor due to the mass splitting becomes significant and the chain reaction departs
from chemical equilibrium. After this point, the abundance of the heavier particles continues its Boltzmann
suppression, Yheavy ∼ e−∆m/T . Consequently, the relic
abundances of the heavier states are much smaller than
that of the lightest state when in the forbidden regime.

It is also reasonable to consider that the interaction
strengths may vary across the chain. In this case, the
Boltzmann equations are best solved by diagonalizing the
system of differential equations. The relic abundance is
approximately given by the degenerate case, but with the
cross-section replaced by the smallest eigenvalue crosssection in the chain.

PHENOMENOLOGY

One of the main phenomenological signatures of the
mechanism are decays of long-lived relics. Late time decaying DM (τ > 1010 yr) can potentially be probed for
all masses. DM decays can change the CMB anisotropies
and spectrum [50], but a detailed study for very heavy
dark matter has not been performed. Decays of super heavy DM can source ultra-high-energy cosmic rays
(UHECR), with energies & 109 GeV. UHECR can be observed in diffuse gamma ray satellites, such as FERMILAT [51], high energy neutrino experiments, such as IceCube [52], and dedicated UHECR observatories, such as
Auger [53]. For studies of the indirect detection of heavy
decaying DM, see Refs. [47, 54–64]. Prospects for discovering UHECR are expected to improve with the proposed
POEMMA mission [65].
Depending on the parameters of the theory (especially
the size of the mass splittings), some of the χi may decay
at various cosmological epochs. For instance, a component of the DM could dissociate light elements during
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (see Ref. [66] and references
therein). Additionally, DM decay can lead to spectral
distortions in the CMB [67–69], which would be probed
by the proposed PiXiE experiment [70]. Partially decaying DM has also been shown to alleviate several cosmological tensions, such as the Hubble tension [71, 72] and
small scale structure puzzles (see e.g. Refs. [73, 74]). For
further studies of multicomponent dark matter with varying lifetimes, see Refs. [75, 76]. A detailed exploration of
the phenomenology of our framework will be presented in
upcoming work [77].

A TOY MODEL

Having described the general mechanism, we now
present a simple model realization. Consider the Lagrangian

Fig. 3, we plot the minimum number of heavy particles
χi needed for the stability and the observed abundance
of dark matter.

where χi (i = 1, · · · , N ) are left-handed Weyl fermions, S
is a SM singlet scalar field, L is the lepton doublet, and
H is the SM Higgs. The model is technically natural,
since it respects a Z2N symmetry that is broken by δm.
Any correction to off-diagonal masses must then depend
on some power of δm. For simplicity, we take δm to
be flavor independent; relaxing the assumption does not
qualitatively alter the results.
The mass matrix is given by
Mij = mi δij + δm(δi,j+1 + δi,j−1 ).

The above structure is similar to a tight-binding model
along a one-dimensional wire in a quantum mechanical system. It is well-known that the wavefunctions
in such system are localized at each site [78]. Assuming ∆m ≡ (mmax − mmin )  δm, the localization length

to ensure that τ & 1027 sec. The ratio between ∆m and
∆m controls both the relic abundance and the lifetime of
DM in this toy model. For the longevity of DM, a small
localization length is preferred, while, for the correct relic
abundance, the localization should be not so small as
it could suppress the nearest neighbor interaction. In

In this Letter, we presented a new freezeout mechanism for super heavy DM that freezes out with the
SM within a standard cosmological history. The relic
abundance is determined solely via its interactions with
the SM. For a velocity-independent cross-section, we
showed the DM mass could be as large as m ∼ 1014 GeV
within the perturbative unitary limit. In an upcoming
paper we show how velocity-dependent interactions,
such as if the scattering was mediated by a light mediator, allows for DM to be as heavy as the Planck scale [24].

[49] We approximate internal propagators as 1/m4 . One
might wonder if the largest contribution arises from internal propagators being almost on-shell. Such possibility arises only with a small phase space density, so the
parametric dependence of the decay rate on m does not
change. Nevertheless, internal propagators generally lead
to larger Γ1 , but this changes our estimate on N only by
∆N ∼ 1–2 for the range of N of our interest.

Super heavy thermal dark matter
Supplemental Material
Hyungjin Kim and Eric Kuflik
In the supplemental material, we present an alternative approach to compute the relic abundance of dark matter
for the N > 2 degenerate case. This method is easily generalized to non-degenerate masses and varying interaction
strengths. In matrix form, the Boltzmann Eqs. (11) can be written as

where nN −1 = (0, · · · , 1)T , Y = (Y1 , · · · , YN −1 )T , and we have replaced the abundance of N th particle with equilibrium
abundance, YN = Yeq . The matrix M is given as
(M)ij = αi (δi,j−1 − δij ) + (δi,j+1 − δij ),

−1 . The normalization was chosen such that Y Y = I.
The Boltzmann system admits Bloch wave-like eigenvectors, and, as a consequence, the eigenvalue shows a band
structure. If one interprets the index i as a discretized one-dimensional wire, it is clear that each eigenvector represents
a configuration of χ densities along this one-dimensional discrete wire, while the eigenvalue represents an effective
strength of scattering processes. Eigenvectors with large k corresponds to short wavelength fluctuations of χ densities
along the wire, and has an O(1) eigenvalue, indicating that these fluctuations decay faster than modes with smaller
eigenvalues. On the other hand, the eigenvector k = 1 has the smallest eigenvalue, β1 ' −π 2 /4N 2 . This corresponds
to the longest wavelength fluctuation of the χ densities. Whatever initial condition we choose, the distribution of
χ abundances relaxes to the mode with the smallest eigenvalue, and the final relic abundance of dark matter is
determined by the freeze-out of this longest wavelength mode.
To compute the relic density of dark matter candidate, we need only consider the k = 1 mode. The Boltzmann
equation for this mode is

which is consistent to the result obtained in continuum limit in the main text for N  1. In particular, the relic
abundance depends on the combination λ|β1 |, which is nothing but the diffusion coefficient D = λπ 2 /4N 2 in the
continuum limit.
