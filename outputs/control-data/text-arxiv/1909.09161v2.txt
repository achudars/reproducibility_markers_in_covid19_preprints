ABSTRACT
We present the visual orbit of the double-lined eclipsing binary, HD 185912, from long baseline interferometry with the CHARA Array. We also obtain echelle spectra from the Apache Point observatory
to update the spectroscopic orbital solution and analyze new photometry from Burggraaff et al. to
model the eclipses. By combining the spectroscopic and visual orbital solutions, we find component
masses of M1 = 1.361 ± 0.004 M⊙ and M2 = 1.331 ± 0.004 M⊙ , and a distance of d = 40.75 ± 0.30 pc
from orbital parallax. From the light curve solution, we find component radii of R1 = 1.348 ± 0.016 R⊙
and R2 = 1.322 ± 0.016 R⊙ . By comparing these observed parameters to stellar evolution models,
we find that HD 185912 is a young system near the zero age main sequence with an estimated age of
500 Myr.
1. INTRODUCTION

Eclipsing binary stars are important tools for testing models of stellar evolution and creating empirical mass-luminosity relationships, specifically when the
masses and radii can be determined to within 3% uncertainty (Torres et al. 2010; Eker et al. 2015; Moya et al.
2018). For example, empirical mass-luminosity relationships are used to determine the masses of exoplanet
host stars (Enoch et al. 2010), and binaries with Aand F-type components are used to test the treatment
of convective core overshooting in evolutionary models (Claret & Torres 2018). However, eclipsing binaries
are often close binary systems with orbital periods less
than seven days, in which tidal interactions and tertiary
companions can significantly affect the structure and
evolution of the component stars (Hurley et al. 2002;
Tokovinin et al. 2006). In order to expand the sample of
binary stars to longer orbital periods where tidal interactions are negligible, long baseline interferometry must
be used to measure the visual orbit to combine with the
spectroscopic orbit. We began an observing campaign at
the CHARA Array and the Apache Point Observatory
lester@astro.gsu.edu

(APO) to measure the visual and spectroscopic orbits
of double-lined binaries (SB2) in order to measure their
fundamental parameters. We presented the results for
our first system, HD 224355, in Lester et al. (2019, Paper I).
The next spectroscopic binary in our sample is
HD 1859121, which consists of a pair of F5 V stars
in a 7.6 day orbital period. The first spectroscopic
solution was determined by Snowden & Koch (1969)
and updated by Andersen et al. (1987) and Behr et al.
(2011). In addition, Albrecht et al. (2007) presented
precise radial velocities from high resolution spectra
as part of their study on the spin-orbit alignment
using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.
HD 185912
is also an eclipsing binary (Snowden & Koch 1969;
van Hamme & Wilson 1984; Andersen et al. 1987)
showing slow apsidal motion with a significant relativistic component (e.g. Dariush et al. 2005; Wolf et al.
2010; Wilson & Raichur 2011). This system was included in the Torres et al. (2010) sample of stars with
accurate fundamental parameters. HD 185912 therefore
1 V1143 Cyg, HR 7484, HIP 96620; α = 19 : 38 : 41.183,
δ = +54 : 58 : 25.642, V = 5.9 mag

presents a rare opportunity to test the results from interferometry against those from photometry and to provide model-independent distances from orbital parallax
to test against GAIA DR2 results (Stassun & Torres
2016, 2018).
We present interferometric observations and the first
visual orbit for this system, as well as an updated spectroscopic and photometric analysis. In Section 2, we
describe our spectroscopic observations from APO and
radial velocity analysis. In Section 3, we present our
interferometric observations from CHARA and the visual orbit. In Section 4, we describe the new photometry of Burggraaff et al. (2018) and our light curve
analysis. In Section 5, we present the resulting stellar parameters and a comparison to evolutionary models. Please note, we refer to the “primary” as the
more massive, hotter star and the “secondary” as the
less massive, cooler star. Due to the orientation of
the orbit, the deeper eclipse actually occurs when the
secondary star is behind the primary, so our notation
is opposite that of van Hamme & Wilson (1984) and
Andersen et al. (1987).

(ARCES; Wang et al. 2003) on the APO 3.5m telescope.

vation was reduced in IRAF using the standard echelle
procedures, including bias subtraction, one dimensional
flat fielding, wavelength calibration using ThAr lamp exposures, and correction from a barycentric to heliocentric logarithmic frame. We removed the blaze function
of each echelle order using the procedure of Kolbas et al.
(2015).
2.2. Radial Velocities
We calculated the radial velocities (Vr ) of HD 185912
using TODCOR, the two-dimensional cross correlation algorithm of Zucker & Mazeh (1994), extended to
multi-order spectra as described in Zucker et al. (2003).
Template spectra for each component were taken from
BLUERED2 model spectra (Bertone et al. 2008) with
atmospheric parameters from Andersen et al. (1987).
These models use solar metallicity with an abundance
mixture from Anders & Grevesse (1989). The radial
velocities from each night are listed in Table 1, along
with the rescaled uncertainties from Section 2.3 and the
residuals from the orbital solution found in Section 3.4.
The monochromatic flux ratio near Hα estimated from
TODCOR is f2 /f1 = 0.91 ± 0.12.

troscopic orbital parameters: the orbital period (P ),
epoch of periastron (T ), eccentricity (e), longitude of
periastron of the primary star (ω1 ), systemic velocity
(γ), and the velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 , K2 ). We
first found separate solutions for the ARCES velocities,
Albrecht et al. (2007) velocities, and Behr et al. (2011)
velocities, in order to rescale the uncertainties by factors of 1.3, 1.4, and 2.4, respectively, so the reduced
χ2 = 1 for each dataset. Offsets of 0.1 km s−1 and
−0.23 km s−1 were also added to the ARCES velocities
and Behr et al. (2011) velocities, respectively, to match
γ = −16.81 km s−1 from Albrecht et al. (2007). Finally,
we combined all data sets and refit for the spectroscopic
orbital solution. The results are listed in the first column
of Table 2, where the uncertainties in each parameter
were determined using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain
feature of RVFIT. Figure 1 shows the radial velocities
from all data sets.
3. INTERFEROMETRY

3.1. ‘Alopeke Observations
The presence of a third companion would greatly bias
our results if not taken into account in our analyses,
specifically affecting the resulting flux ratios, radial velocities, and orbital inclination. In order to search for
the presence of a tertiary companion, HD 185912 was
observed with the ‘Alopeke speckle imager (Scott et al.
2018) on the Gemini North telescope4 in 2018 October.
A set of 1000 60 ms exposures were taken in the 562 nm
and 716 nm bands simultaneously and reduced using
the speckle team’s pipeline (Howell et al. 2011). Figure
2 shows a plot of the background sensitivity limit found
using the method described in Horch et al. (2017). No
tertiary companions were found within 1.5′′ down to a
contrast of ∆m = 4.0 mag. Any more distant companions would be beyond the fields-of-view of our spectroscopic and interferometric observations.
3.2. CLIMB Observations
We observed HD 185912 with the CHARA Array
(ten Brummelaar et al. 2005) eleven times from 2016
June – 2019 April, using the CLIMB (ten Brummelaar et al.
2013) beam combiner to combine the K ′ -band light from
three telescopes. Table 3 lists the observation dates, the
telescopes and calibrator stars used, the number of
data points measured, and the average Fried parameter
(r0 ) for each night. Our data were reduced with the
pipeline developed by J. D. Monnier, using the general
method described in Monnier et al. (2011) and extended
to three beams (e.g., Kluska et al. 2018), resulting in

squared visibilities (V 2 ) for each baseline and closure
phases (CP) for each closed triangle. Instrumental and
atmospheric effects on the observed visibilities were
measured using observations of stars with known angular diameters (HD 178207, 184170, 186760 and 187748)
taken before and after the target. One calibrator-targetcalibrator sequence is referred to as a “bracket”. The
respective K ′ -band angular diameters from SearchCal5
are 0.260 ± 0.007 mas, 0.592 ± 0.014 mas, 0.445 ± 0.011
mas, and 0.374 ± 0.009 mas (Chelli et al. 2016).

3.3. Binary Positions
Binary positions were measured using the grid search
code6 of Schaefer et al. (2016). We estimated the angular diameters of both components to be 0.26 mas using the GAIA DR2 parallax (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016, 2018) and the radii from Andersen et al. (1987).
Both stars are smaller than the 0.6 mas angular resolution of CLIMB and therefore unresolved, so we held
the angular diameters fixed and fit only for the relative
position of the secondary component and the flux ratio,
as described in Paper I. Table 4 lists the separation and
position angle of the secondary component (measured
east of north) for each night, the major axis, minor axis
and position angle of the error ellipse, and the best-fit
flux ratio at 2.13µm. The weighted average flux ratio
from all nights is f2 /f1 = 0.97 ± 0.06. The sizes of the
error ellipses depend on several factors, including the
number of brackets obtained, the telescope combination
used, the seeing, and the data quality. Figure 3 shows
the observed relative positions, as well as the best-fit
visual orbit found in the next section.

3.4. Combined Visual + Spectroscopic Solution
From the visual orbit alone, one can determine the
orbital inclination (i), angular semi-major axis (a), and
longitude of the ascending node (Ω). By combining the
interferometric and spectroscopic data, we can fit for all
ten orbital parameters (P , T , e, i, a, ω1 , Ω, γ, K1 , K2 )
using the method of Schaefer et al. (2016), described in
detail in Paper I. The best fit orbital parameters for this
combined (VB+SB2) solution are listed in the third column of Table 2, along with the uncertainties calculated
using a Monte Carlo error analysis. The best-fit model
radial velocity curves are shown in Figure 1 and model
visual orbit is shown in Figure 3.

Table 5. Stellar Parameters of HD 185912

4.1. MASCARA Light Curve
HD 185912 was recently observed by the Multi-site
All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA7 ) photometric survey of
Burggraaff et al. (2018), who completed V -band relative photometry of bright stars in search of exoplanets.
The observations spanned ten orbital cycles, but the primary and secondary eclipses were observed fully in only
two. We first removed the systematic effects as a function of lunar phase and sidereal time as described in
their paper and folded the data using the orbital period
from the spectroscopic solution. We then removed outlier points by calculating the residuals against a model
light curve with parameters from Andersen et al. (1987)
and discarding all of the points outside three times the
standard deviation. The folded light curve is shown in
Figure 4.
4.2. Light Curve Modeling
We modeled the light curve using the Eclipsing Light
Curve code of Orosz & Hauschildt (2000). We held the
orbital period fixed to the spectroscopic solution and
used ELC’s genetic optimizer to fit for T , e, i, and ω1 ,
as well as the relative radius of each component (R1 /a,
R2 /a) and the temperature ratio (Teff 2 /Teff 1 ). We
found that T , e, and ω1 were well constrained by the
optimizer and are listed in Table 2. The inclination,
relative radii, and temperature ratio were not well constrained, because it is difficult to determine the individual radii directly from the light curve in partially eclipsing systems with very similar components. There exists
a family of solutions that fit the observations equally
well, so that only the value of (R1 + R2 )/a can be determined accurately.
To show this more clearly, we calculated the χ2
goodness-of-fit statistic across the primary and secondary eclipses for model light curves over a grid of
R1 /a and R2 /a values, fitting for the inclination and
temperature ratio at each grid point. In order to weight
equally the primary and secondary eclipses, we divided
the χ2 values for each eclipse by the number of points
within each eclipse (124 and 458) before adding the χ2
values together. Figure 5 shows the χ2 contour as a
function of relative radius, where the valley of possible
solutions is easily visible.
Solving the problem of partially eclipsing systems
therefore requires additional constraints; for example,
Andersen et al. (1987) used the luminosity ratio from
their spectroscopic analysis to inform their results. We
used the observed flux ratios and model surface fluxes

the solid line in Figure 5. We found the minimum χ2
value along this line to correspond to i = 86.9 ± 0.1
deg, R1 /a = 0.0594 ± 0.0011, R2 /a = 0.0582 ± 0.0011,
and Teff 2 /Teff 1 = 0.99 ± 0.01. The uncertainties correspond to where χ2 ≤ χ2min + 1. This inclination is
consistent with that from the visual orbit, however this
value does depend on the relative radii and surface flux
models while the visual orbit is independent of models.
5. STELLAR PARAMETERS

5.1. Masses and Distance
By combining the results from spectroscopy with those
of interferometry, we found the component masses of
HD 185912 to be M1 = 1.361 ± 0.004M⊙ and M2 =
1.332 ± 0.004M⊙. By combining the angular and physical sizes of the orbit, we found the distance to be
d = 41.02 ± 0.22 pc. This is consistent with the Hipparcos distance of d = 40.88 ± 0.48 pc (Perryman et al.
1997; van Leeuwen 2007) and the GAIA DR2 distance
of d = 40.47 ± 0.08 pc (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016,
2018).
5.2. Effective Temperatures and Rotational Velocities
We first used the Doppler tomography algorithm of
Bagnuolo et al. (1992) to reconstruct the individual
spectrum of each component for all echelle orders between 4000 − 7000Å. We then cross-correlated the reconstructed spectra with BLUERED models of different
effective temperatures to find the best-fit temperature
for each echelle order. The maximum correlation for
each order was used to calculate the weighted average
temperature for each component, where better correlated orders were more highly weighted, and the uncertainty corresponding to the standard deviation of
the temperatures from all orders. We found the ef-

fective temperatures to be Teff 1 = 6620 ± 190 K and
Teff 2 = 6570 ± 220 K.
These values are higher than those determined
by Smalley et al. (2002) from the Balmer line profiles (Teff 1 = 6441 ± 201 K and Teff 2 = 6393 ±
136 K), but consistent with the values determined
by Wilson & Raichur (2011) from absolute photometry (Teff 1 = 6653 ± 11 K and Teff 2 = 6558 ± 5 K).
However, the latter uncertainties are rather underestimated; the authors included internal uncertainties from
the least squares fitting procedure and calibration of
the filter passbands in their code, but did not incorporate uncertainties in the observations from comparison
star magnitudes nor uncertainties in the fixed model
parameters.
We used a similar method as described above to determine the projected rotational velocity (V sin i) of each
component by cross-correlating model spectra of different V sin i with the reconstructed spectra. We found
V1 sin i = 19.1 ± 0.6 km s−1 and V2 sin i = 27.9 ±
1.2 km s−1 . These rotational velocities are consistent
with the more precise values found by Albrecht et al.
(2007) (19.6 ± 0.1 km s−1 and 28.2 ± 0.1 km s−1 ).
Both components are also rotating slower than the projected pseudo-synchronous velocities of 31.1 km s−1 and
30.5 km s−1 .
5.3. Radii and Surface Gravities
We created surface flux models of each component
from ATLAS9 model atmospheres (Castelli & Kurucz
2004) using the temperatures found in the previous
section. By comparing the observed flux ratios and
model surface fluxes, we calculated the radius ratio to
be R2 /R1 = 0.96 ± 0.08 near Hα from the spectroscopic
flux ratio and R2 /R1 = 0.99 ± 0.04 in K ′ -band from the
interferometric flux ratio. The weighted average radius
ratio is R2 /R1 = 0.98 ± 0.04. We then used this radius
ratio to determine the individual stellar radii from two
methods; spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and
light curve fitting.
For the first method, we took broad-band photometry
from the literature to create the SED for HD 185912
shown in Figure 7, which includes ultraviolet data
from TD1 (Thompson et al. 1978), optical data from
Egret et al. (1992), and infrared data from 2MASS
(Skrutskie et al. 2006) and WISE (Wright et al. 2010).
We then created a binary SED model to compare to
the observed SED by integrating the surface flux models across each photometric passband, and then fit for
the primary angular diameter and reddening (see Section 5.2 of Paper I). We found angular diameters of
θ1 = 0.32 ± 0.01 mas and θ2 = 0.31 ± 0.01 mas, which
correspond to stellar radii of R1 = 1.39 ± 0.04R⊙ ,

R2 = 1.37 ± 0.06R⊙ , and a reddening value of
E(B − V ) = 0.08 ± 0.01 mag.
For the second method, we used the orbital parameters found in Section 3.4 and the relative radii found in
Section 4.2 to calculate the individual stellar radii. We
found R1 = 1.348 ± 0.016R⊙ and R2 = 1.322 ± 0.016R⊙,
corresponding to surface gravities of log g1 = 4.31 ± 0.03
and log g2 = 4.32 ± 0.04 as listed in Table 5. Both methods provide consistent results, but this is expected since
they depend on the same model fluxes and radius ratio. Using these radii from the light curve solution and
the effective temperatures, we calculated the luminosities of each component to be L1 = 3.35 ± 0.44 L⊙ and
L2 = 3.13 ± 0.50 L⊙ from the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
5.4. Comparison with Evolutionary Models
We created model evolutionary tracks for each component of HD 185912 using the Yonsei-Yale (Y2 ) evolutionary models of Demarque et al. (2004) and the
MESA stellar evolution code of Paxton et al. (2011,
2013, 2015, 2018, 2019), shown in Figure 8. The YonseiYale models8 were created using the model interpolation
program, and the MESA models9 were created using
MESA release 10108 with overshooting parameters for
each component taken from the empirical relationship
of Claret & Torres (2018). Both sets of models are nonrotating and use solar metallicity. The Yonsei-Yale models use the solar abundance mixture from Grevesse et al.
(1996), while the MESA models use the mixture of
Grevesse & Sauval (1998).
As seen in Figure 8, HD 185912 lies very close to
the zero age main sequence. We estimated the age of
each component based on the portions of the evolutionary tracks that lie within the observed uncertainties,
then took the average to estimate system ages of 550
Myr from the Yonsei-Yale models and 100 Myr from the
MESA models. The individual ages of each component
from their evolutionary tracks are consistent to within
5%. This young age is confirmed by the presence of the
Li I 6708Å absorption line in our spectra.
6. DISCUSSION

We determined the first visual orbit for HD 185912
from long baseline interferometry with the CHARA Array, as well as updated spectroscopic orbits and photometric analysis. From the combined visual and spectroscopic solution, we found the component masses to
within 0.3% and the distance to within 0.8%. We
found the component radii to within 5% from SED
fitting and to within 1.2% from light curve modeling,

but these errors are likely underestimated in partially
eclipsing systems. Therefore, more precise photometry
during the eclipses is needed to determine the individual radii, such as the highly anticipated TESS observations currently underway in the northern hemisphere
(Ricker et al. 2015).

By comparing our observed stellar parameters to
evolutionary models, we found that HD 185912 is
a young system located on the zero age main sequence and likely in the process of tidal circularization
(Meibom & Mathieu 2005). We checked for member-

website (Gagné et al. 2018), which compares the position, proper motion, radial velocity, and parallax to that
of each moving group. BANYAN reported a membership probability of 0% for all associations, so HD 185912
is simply a young field star.
Eclipsing binaries like HD 185912 are important for
comparing the results from interferometry and photometry. Specifically, the orbital inclination from interferometry is consistent with the results from photometry,
providing a proof of concept for our project. We are
continuing interferometric observations of several other
longer period spectroscopic binaries to determine their
visual orbits and determine their fundamental stellar parameters.
