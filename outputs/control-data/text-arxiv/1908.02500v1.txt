ABSTRACT

SALT spectra of the helium-rich hot subdwarf EC 22536-5304 show strong absorption
lines of triply-ionized lead. Analysis of the HRS spectrum and a follow-up SALT/RSS
spectrum show EC 22536-5304 to have surface properties (temperature, gravity, helium/hydrogen ratio) similar to other heavy-metal subdwarfs. With a lead overabundance of 4.8 dex relative to solar, EC 22536-5304 is the most lead-rich intermediate
helium subdwarf discovered so far.

INTRODUCTION

Hot subluminous stars generally have surfaces which are
either extremely hydrogen-rich or helium-rich. The former
are probably due to chemical diffusion in the stellar atmosphere which encourages the heavier helium to sink
(Heber 1986). The latter are probably due to a previous
evolution which has involved the destruction of hydrogen
(Iben 1990; Han et al. 2002; Zhang & Jeffery 2012). A small
group of hot subdwarfs with intermediate helium abundances has been identified (e.g. Schulz et al. 1991), of which
several show remarkable overabundances of certain irongroup and/or trans-iron elements (Edelmann et al. 2003;
Naslim et al. 2011, 2013; Jeffery et al. 2017; Wild & Jeffery
2018). The frequency with which these stars occur, the range
of surface properties, and the reason for their extraordinary surface characteristics represent significant questions
for subdwarf astronomy. This paper reports the analysis of
an intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarf observed during a
medium and high-resolution spectroscopic survey of southern hot subdwarfs with the Southern Africa Large Telescope
(SALT; Buckley et al. (2006); O’Donoghue et al. (2006)).

OBSERVATIONS

EC 22536-5304 (=GALEX J225635.7-524837.1, α2000 =
22◦ 56′ 35.76′′ , δ2000 = −52◦ 48′ 37.71′′ ) was identified as
a hot subdwarf in the Edinburgh Cape survey (Zone 4)
(Kilkenny et al. 2016), and as a helium-rich sdOB star by
Geier et al. (2017).
As part of an ongoing programme to identify and analyse early-type hydrogen-deficient stars of interest, EC 225365304 was observed with the Southern Africa Large telescope
(SALT) High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) in medium
resolution mode on 2017 May 18 and on 2018 November 15.
Exposure times were 2 × 2000 s on both occasions. The nominal instrumental resolution R ≈ 43 000. The mean signalto-noise ratio in the continuum around λλ4560 − 4580Å
is ≈ 17 (σ = 0.06). The 2017 observation was reduced
to wavelength-calibrated orders using the pyHRS pipeline
(Crawford 2015; Crawford et al. 2016), sky-subtracted and
order-merged using bespoke echelle-management software.
The pyHRS pipeline was no longer maintained by SALT at
the time of the 2018 observations. Both 2017 and 2018 observations were reduced in an analogous way using the MIDAS based pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, 2017). The MIDAS pipeline delivers a wavelength calibration robust to
< 300 m s−1 , but has poorer signal-to-noise and blaze correction characteristics. Therefore we used the MIDAS-reduced
product for radial velocities and the pyHRS-reduced product for all other purposes.
A notable feature in the spectrum of EC 22536-5304 is
the presence of a strong isolated aborption line at λ4496Å,

a wavelength corresponding to that of triply ionized lead
(Pbiv λ4496Å). Since this would indicate a star with comparable properties to the heavy-metal subdwarfs, it became
a priority for follow-up analysis. This is the only Pbiv line
lying above the steep drop in HRS sensitivity around 4300Å.
With relatively short wavelength ranges covered by individual échelle orders, échelle spectra are notoriously difficult to rectify in the presence of broad hydrogen and helium
absorption lines. To provide confirmation, EC 22536-5304
was observed with the SALT Robert Stobie Spectrograph
(RSS; Burgh et al. (2003); Kobulnicky et al. (2003)) using
grating PG2300 on 2018 June 4. The RSS detector consists
of three adjacent charge-coupled devices, separated by two
gaps. Double exposures were taken at two different grating
angles to provide a continuous spectrum in the wavelength
range 3850 – 5150 Å and to more easily reject cosmic-ray
contamination. Exposure times were 2 × 50 s at camera angle 63.95◦ and 2 × 70 s at 60.05◦ . The mean instrumental
resolution R ≈ 3600. The mean signal-to-noise ratio in the
continuum around λλ4560 − 4580Å is ≈ 100 (σ = 0.01).
Basic data processing was applied using the pysalt1 package (Crawford et al. 2010) and then reduced using standard
iraf tasks and the lacosmic package (van Dokkum 2001)
as per the process described by Koen et al. (2017). Contemporaneous arc lamp exposures were used to determine the
wavelength solution for each spectrum. The one-dimensional
spectra were extracted using the apall task and these were
rectified using low-order polynomials fitted to regions of continuum identified autonomously, and merged using weights
based on the number of photons detected in each segment
of spectrum used as input.
The resulting spectra are shown in compact form in
Figs. 1 and 2. Significantly, the absorption line at λ4496Å
is strong enough to appear in the RSS spectrum. There is
also a stronger feature present at λ4050Å which corresponds
(in wavelength and strength) to Pbiv λ4050Å, confirming
the identification of the longer wavelength line in the HRS
spectrum.

ANALYSIS
Radial velocity

The radial velocity (RV) of EC 22536-5304 was measured
by comparing the SALT/HRS spectrum with a theoretical
spectrum for a helium-rich subdwarf. In this case, there are
substantial differences in RV between the spectra reduced
with pyHRS and with MIDAS; on the basis of substantial
external testing (Kniazev 2016), we adopt the MIDAS RVs.
On the dates observed the heliocentric velocities were:
2017 05 18 : − 10.0 ± 0.5 km s−1 and
2018 11 18 : + 19.5 ± 0.5 km s−1 .
The above values and errors were obtained by comparing
cross-correlation velocities for several different spectral regions between 4300 and 5400 Å. Measurements on the two
dates are so significantly different that we suspect the radial velocity to be variable. Additional observations will be
required to explain the difference.
The absolute RSS radial-velocity calibration is not reliable because the light paths for comparison-lamp and
starlight beams are not identical. No velocity is reported
for this spectrum.
3.2

Photospheric parameters

Analyses of both RSS and HRS spectra were carried out using the Armagh LTE radiative transfer codes2 (Jeffery et al.
2001; Behara & Jeffery 2006). These include the model atmosphere code sterne, the formal solution code spectrum
and the general purpose fitting package sfit.
For both spectra, effective temperature, surface gravity
and surface helium and hydrogen abundances were obtained
by finding the best fit spectrum in a grid of models computed
with sterne and spectrum.
The grid adopted covers a parameter space with
[ Teff /kK, log g/cm s−2 , nHe ] =
[26(04)42, 3.8(0.4)6.0, 0.1(0.2)0.9, 1.0].
The first grid adopted (p00) assumed a solar distribution of metal abundances and a microturbulent velocity
vturb = 5 km s−1 for both the calculation of line opacities
in the model atmosphere calculation (which affects the temperature stratification of the models) and for the formal solution, which affects relative line strengths and widths. In
view of the highly non-standard abundances of helium-rich
subdwarfs, it was evident that several strong predicted lines
(apart from H and He) are absent from the observed spectrum. Since these could impact the quality of the fits, a
second grid (hiz) was computed with reduced abundances
of light elements, solar iron and enhanced calcium. The grids
are sampled over the wavelength interval 4100 − 5200Å at
intervals of 0.05Å for analysing HRS spectra, and over the
wavelength interval 3500 − 5500Å at intervals of 0.25Å for
analysing RSS spectra.
Best fits to the data were optimized by interpolating linearly in the model grid and using the Levenburg-Marquardt
least-squares-minimisation option in sfit. An essential ingredient in the fit procedure is the statistical error associated

with each point in the observed spectrum. Here we used the
values σ reported in § 2. Whilst not ideal, at present none of
the data reduction pipelines currently used for SALT spectroscopy preserves and propagates error estimates from raw
data through to final product. In particular, the error associated with HRS échelle spectra varies considerably along
each order.
A problem with fitting the blue-optical spectra of hot
subdwarfs which have intermediate helium abundances is
that it is difficult to fit both the hydrogen Balmer lines, the
neutral helium lines and the ionized helium lines simultaneously. To illustrate, fits were first obtained including the
full range of the spectra (3850 – 5100Å for RSS and 4100 –
5200Å for HRS) with all wavelengths equally weighted, The

solutions are labelled A in Table 1, subscripted rss and hrs
to indicate the spectrum measured. The role of the principal helium lines in the fit was then enhanced by reducing
the relative weight of data points outside the vicinity of Hei
4026, 4388, 4471 Å and Heii 4540, 4686Å. The window sizes
were ±10 − 25Å depending on linewidth. In practice, the error σ associated with each data point outside these windows
was increased by a factor 30. The resulting fit yielded the
solutions labelled B in Table 1.
Other factors which affect both the solution and the
quality of the fit include:
– the tolerance adopted for Levenburg-Marquardt convergence (0.0003). Increasing to 0.001 had no effect.
– start values for the iteration. Adopted solutions were reMNRAS 000, 1–8 (2014)

EC 22536-5304: a new lead-rich subdwarf
peatable from different start values.
– the model atmosphere grid. The hiz grid was consistent
with the final abundances reported in § 3.3.
The results for RSS and HRS spectra are consistent
after allowing for the systematic differences in spectral normalisation, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. The low surface gravity obtained in fit Ahrs reflects the different balance between H and Hei lines in the HRS and RSS spectra.
It probably also reflects the difficulty of rectifying échelle
spectral orders where these contain line profiles extend over
nearly an entire échelle order or more.
For this paper, we adopt the solution labelled Bhrs on
the basis that the temperature difference between HRS and
RSS solutions is smaller when the helium lines are given additional weight and that the HRS spectrum is more sensitive
to subordinate line indicators of the ionization equilibrium.
The small formal errors on log g shown in Table 1 reflect the
manner in which the Stark-broadened hydrogen and helium
lines dominate the fit, so that once temperature is established, the gravity is well constrained. In practice the errors
are not independent, and the error matrix should be investigated further. The range of values shown in Table 1 indicates
the magnitude of systematic errors.
Therefore we give the adopted surface properties for
EC 22536-5304 as Teff = 35 550 ± 1 500 K, log g/cm s−2 =
5.92 ± 0.15, and nHe = 0.17 ± 0.05, where the errors include an allowance for systematic contributions. It is noted
that this solution shown in Fig. 2 gives the lowest helium
abundance amongst those obtained.
3.3

Abundances

Abundances of minor species may be obtained in a number
of ways. In the line-by-line approach, equivalent widths of
isolated or blended lines of the same species are used with
spectrum to solve directly for the line abundance using
a Newton-Raphson iteration. In the spectrum-synthesis approach, the abundances of selected species can be optimised
using sfit which uses a Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm to
minimize the mean square difference between fit and observed spectrum. The former is more direct but susceptible
to the choice of lines – a choice which can be used to avoid
lines known to have poor atomic data or to be strongly affected by non-LTE, or which can omit the contributions of
weak lines which may be intrinsically more accurate by lying
on the linear part of the curve-of-growth. The latter can incorporate information from many weak lines, from the entire
line profile, and can deal with multi-species blends. After hydrogen and helium lines, the optical spectrum of EC 225365304 is dominated by carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. With
isolated exceptions, the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio
in the HRS spectra precluded the clear identification of predicted lines of magnesium, aluminium, silicon, sulphur or
iron. Attempts to infer abundances by optimisation other
than for C, N and O were unsuccessful. In view of the noise,
we executed a line-by-line analysis for the latter species and
for the lead line at 4496Å.
The model atmosphere from which the formal solutions
were calculated was chosen from the hiz grid by proximity
to solution Bhrs , and had Teff /kK = 36, log g/cm s−2 = 6.00
and nHe = 0.2, and assumed vturb = 5 km s−1 .
Equivalent widths were measured for 24 carbon lines,
MNRAS 000, 1–8 (2014)

26 nitrogen lines and 37 oxygen lines, as well as for
Pb iv4496Å. Abundances were derived for each line and averages formed for each ion. Eliminating lines which showed
abundances different to the ion average by greater than
0.31 dex, overall average abundances were computed and
are shown in Table 2. As an ionization equilibrium check
on the measurement of Teff , the abundance ratios of
C ii/iii and N ii/iii were -0.12 and 0.01 dex respectively.
Reducing the gravity to log g/cm s−2 = 5.75 (solution
Arss ) changed the values in Table 2 to log ǫC,N,O,Pb =
8.71(19), 8.01(14), 8.27(20), 6.53(25).
A regression of abundance versus equivalent width for
Oii lines shows a clear positive gradient; efforts to reduce this
gradient to zero usually involve increasing vturb . This is ruled
out by the core of the C ii4267Å doublet which is resolved in
the HRS observation placing an upper limit of 5 km s−1 to
line broadening from all sources including rotation and turbulence 3 . Alternative explanations for the gradient include
non-LTE effects and chemical stratification, neither of which
can be addressed with the current data and models. Abundance analyses of normal subdwarfs frequently adopt vturb =
0 (Heber et al. 2000). This would change the values in Table
2 to log ǫC,N,O,Pb = 8.78(20), 8.05(13), 8.27(14), 6.63(25).
The differences are < 0.1 dex and insubstantial. Nevertheless, the question of microturbulence should be investigated
further with higher quality data for one or more of the heavymetal subdwarfs. Such an investigation should also consider
the consequences of extreme stratification due to selective
radiative levitation in the stellar photosphere.
An atlas of the spectrum showing the formal solution
is shown in Fig. 1. Lines with theoretical equivalent widths
> 40mÅ (in the model) are labelled. Several observed lines
are not present in the model. These lines are also visible
in the spectrum of UVO 0825+15, and have not yet been
identified (Jeffery et al. 2017).
The abundance of lead measured from a single line in
the HRS spectrum corresponds to nearly 5 dex greater than
solar. Both the 4496.2 and 4049.8Å lines show up as weak
features covering 2 pixels each in the RSS spectrum, with
equivalent widths 35 ± 20 and 86 ± 20 mÅ(estimated errors).
These correspond to abundances log ǫPb = 6.36 ± 0.30 and
6.66 ± 0.16. The lead abundance in EC 22536-5304 is therefore considerable; more precise data from high S/N high-

3

The concept of microturbulence was originally introduced to
account for abnormal broadening of hydrogen lines in the solar
spectrum (de Jager 1954), and subsequently as a diagnostic of
convection in stellar photospheres. It is also used in a different
sense, as here, to explain why for a given abundance observed
equivalent widths of strong lines are systematically weaker than
predicted when compared with weak lines of the same species
(Traving 1964; Hundt 1973). It is therefore a device used in the
line profile calculation to increase overall line opacity preferentially for weak lines, rather than being a description of a physical
process associated with line broadening. The requirement that
atomic diffusion plays a key rôle in the chemical structure of hot
subdwarf photospheres implies a dynamically quiet environment.
However this and the absence of observed broadening may not
preclude the need for an opacity-enhancing device. Recent work
on B stars suggests that a full non-LTE treatment and metallicity can play as strong a rôle as the microturbulent velocity
(Daszyńska-Daszkiewicz & Szewczuk 2011).

resolution spectroscopy covering a wider spectral range is
required.
Since overabundances of other trans-iron elements are
observed in intermediate helium-rich subdwarfs, it is useful
to ask whether lead is the only such element with an elevated abundance in EC 22536-5304. By assigning an upper
limit of 5 mÅ for the identification of lines in clean regions of
the HRS spectrum, an upper limit log ǫZr < 5.00 is obtained
from non-detection of Zriv 4569.3Å, the strongest predicted
zirconium line in the HRS spectral range. This is 1.5 dex below the level observed in LS IV−14◦ 116 (Naslim et al. 2010),
but does not exclude some enrichment above the solar value
of 2.5.

DISCUSSION

Following the discovery of the first zirconium-rich
intermediate-helium subdwarf and, subsequently, of similar lead-rich subdwarfs, an increasing number of heavymetal subdwarfs have been discovered. Four have been published and a further five have been announced recently
(Dorsch et al. 2018; Latour et al. 2019; Naslim et al. 2019).
Figure 3 shows the distribution of published intermediate helium-rich subdwarfs in the g − Teff and y − Teff
planes, as well as the distributions of helium-rich and
helium-poor subdwarfs. It includes helium-rich stars both
with and without observed excesses of heavy elements.
The former include LS IV−14◦ 116 (Naslim et al. 2011),
HE 2359–2844 and HE 1256-2738 (Naslim et al. 2013),
PG 1559+048 and FBS 1749+373 (Naslim et al. 2019). The
latter include BPS CS 22956-0094 (Naslim et al. 2013),
PG 0909+276, UVO 0512-08 (Wild & Jeffery 2018), Ton 414
and GALEX J17554+5012 (Naslim et al. 2019). Amongst
the second group, PG 0909+276 and UVO 0512–08 show
high excesses of iron-group elements (Edelmann 2003;
Wild & Jeffery 2018). No extreme overabundances were detected in the remaining three, which are substantially more
helium-rich. The figure illustrates how stars in approximately the same volume of Teff − g − y space show a considerable variety of enhanced chemistries.
EC 22536-5304 sits squarely amongst the heavy-metal
subdwarfs, and possibly at the cool extremity of the current
sample. It demonstrates how strongly concentrated selected
species can become in the line forming region of the photosphere. Previous papers (Naslim et al. 2011; Green et al.
2011; Jeffery et al. 2017) have discussed the possible origin
of the heavy-metal excess in terms of selective radiative levitation in the stellar photosphere. These ideas will be reviewed in the light of EC 22536-5304 and other new discoveries in due course (Jeffery et al. in prep.).

CONCLUSION

SALT HRS observations of the faint-blue He-sdOB star
EC 22536-5304 show it to be an intermediate helium-rich
subdwarf. It shows very strong absorption lines due to triply
ionized lead from which the inferred abundance inferred is
some 4.8 dex above solar, making EC 22536-5304 the most
lead-rich subdwarf identified to date. For a hot subdwarf, the
atmosphere is moderately rich in carbon and oxygen, with

the abundances of both exceeding that of nitrogen. However,
in this respect EC 22536-5304 is no more exceptional than
other intermediate helium-rich subdwarfs.
Additional high-resolution observations are required to
resolve the radial velocity behaviour of EC 22536-5304, and
to provide sufficiently high-quality data to measure abundances of other species. Detailed model atmospheres including physics of radiative levitation and gravitational settling
of these heavy metals need to be constructed to test the
proposal that superabundances arise from chemical diffusion. Photometric observations repeated over several hours
with a precision better than 0.5% should be carried out to
check for pulsations. Meanwhile, because of the exceptional
strength of the signature absorption lines, these observations
demonstrate the potential or SALT and RSS to discover additional heavy-metal subdwarfs.

numbers of mÅ and errors are shown in units of Å×10−4 ,
i.e. an equivalent width of 6.2 ± 0.1mÅ is shown as 6 ± 1.
The error estimate is primarily derived from the variance
measured from continuum windows either side of the line
being measured.

APPENDIX A: EQUIVALENT WIDTH
MEASUREMENTS
Table A.1 shows measured equivalent widths (Wλ ) in mÅ
and laboratory wavelengths for lines identified in the HRS
spectrum of EC 22536-5304. Abundances derived from lines
marked ”:” were not included in the final means, having individual line abundances more than 0.31 dex from these values. To save space, equivalent widths are rounded to whole
