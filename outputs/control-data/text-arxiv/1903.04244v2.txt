Abstract
Four-fermion interaction models are often used as simplified models of interacting fermion
fields with the chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry is dynamically broken for a larger fourfermion coupling. It is expected that the broken symmetry is restored under extreme conditions.
In this paper, the finite size effect on the chiral symmetry breaking is investigated in the fourfermion interaction model. We consider the model on a flat spacetime with a compactified
spatial coordinate, MD−1 ⊗ S 1 and obtain explicit expressions of the effective potential for
arbitrary spacetime dimensions in the leading order of the 1/N expansion. Evaluating the
effective potential, we show the critical lines which divide the symmetric and the broken phase
and the sign-flip condition for the Casimir force.

Introduction

Fundamental theories of particle physics are constructed based on several types of symmetry. It is
expected that a fundamental theory with a higher symmetry is realized at the early universe. The
symmetry of the theory is partly broken on the ground state. The remnant symmetry is observed
in our laboratories. Since the physical state depends on the environment, the broken symmetry can
be restored under extreme conditions, small size, high temperature, high density, strong curvature,
strong electromagnetic field, and so on. It is considered that there is a possibility to test the
models of particle physics through the critical phenomena induced by the symmetry transition with
changing the environment.
Y. Nambu and G. Jona-Lasinio proposed a simple model with interacting fermions in 1961 [1]. A
four-fermion interaction model with a discrete Z2 chiral symmetry is introduced in two dimensions
by D. J. Gross and A. Neveu [2]. In the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) and Gross–Neveu (GN)
models four-fermion interactions induce non-vanishing expectation value for the composite operator
constructed by a fermion and an anti-fermion and the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken.
Many works have been done to study the symmetry transition in the four-fermion interaction models
under various environmental conditions, for a review, see [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and references therein. One
of the interesting conditions to induce the symmetry transition is found in the size of the spacetime.

All the materials may be confined inside a small size space with a non-trivial topology at the early
universe. The existence of finite extra dimensions is predicted in string theory and M-theory.
The finite size effect on the chiral symmetry has been studied in four-fermion interaction models
with periodic or anti-periodic boundary conditions for the fermion fields. It is found that the chiral
symmetry tends to be broken due to the finite size effect for the periodic boundary condition and
the broken symmetry tends to be restored for the anti-periodic boundary condition [6, 8, 9]. The
effective potential of the four-fermion interaction model has been calculated in a more general U(1)valued boundary condition along with a compact direction and the phase structure of the model is
evaluated with respect to the U(1) phase [10].
In an Abelian gauge theory such boundary conditions can be realized for charged fermions
through the Aharonov-Bohm effect [11]. Hence, the finite size effect with a U(1)-valued boundary
condition can be realized in the presence of a gauge field. It is well-known that a constant magnetic
field enhances the chiral symmetry breaking. It is shown that the enhanced symmetry breaking can
be counteracted by the finite size effect with the anti-periodic boundary condition [12]. A constant
magnetic flux crosses the transverse section of the cylinder has been studied in lower dimensional
cylindrical spacetime [13, 14, 15, 16]. The possibility of an inhomogeneous condensation has been
discussed in a superconducting ring with an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux [17]. It has been pointed
out that the finite size phase transition may be observed as a nontrivial behavior in the Casimir
force [18, 19, 20].
In the present paper we study four-fermion interaction models on MD−1 ⊗ S 1 and develop the
procedure to calculate the stable environment and the Casimir effect. The ground state is found by
observing the minimum of the effective potential. The phase boundary can be found by solving the
stationary condition of the effective potential for a fixed size and a topology. We need to evaluate
the zero-point energy to determine the stable size and the topology and to calculate the Casimir
force.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we briefly review the chiral symmetry breaking in
four-fermion interaction models on MD . We employ the 1/N expansion and calculate the effective
potential for the fermion and anti-fermion composite field. In Sec. 3 we consider the model on
MD−1 ⊗ S 1 with a nontrivial topology. Evaluating the effective potential with a zero-point energy,
we obtain the dynamically generated fermion mass and the critical length for a fixed boundary
condition. In Sec. 4 the Casimir force is calculated from the effective potential and the sign flip
condition is derived. Section 5 is devoted to the concluding remarks.

The basic model: Four-fermion interaction model on MD

In this section we consider the Dirac fermion on a flat D-dimensional Minkowski spacetime MD
and follow the discussions in [21]. The Dirac fermion is decomposed into left- and right-handed
chiral states. In relativistic quantum field theories left- and right-handed chiral state, ψL and ψR ,
for the four-components Dirac fermion ψ can be described as
ψL =

1 − γ5
ψ,
2

ψR =

1 + γ5
ψ,

(1)

with the fifth Dirac gamma matrix, γ 5 . The chiral symmetry which preserves the chirality of the
system gives fundamental and important concepts in particle physics. It is defined by the invariance
under the chiral transformation,
5

ψ −→ eiγ θ ψ.

(2)

It transforms the left-handed and right-handed fermions with an opposite sign phase. The chiral
symmetry prohibits the fermion field from having a mass term. The simplest fermion and antifermion interaction which maintains the chiral symmetry is four-fermion interactions.
Throughout this paper we employ a simple four-fermion interaction model with N -flavor of
Dirac fermions which is introduced by Y. Nambu and G. Jona-Lasinio [1]. The model is defined by
the action,

where the index a denotes the flavors of the fermion field ψ and λ0 is the bare coupling constant
for the four-fermion interactions. The action (3) is invariant under the chiral transformation (2). If
the four-fermion interaction induces a non-vanishing expectation value for the composite operator
ψ̄a ψa , a fermion mass term is generated and the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken.
For practical calculations it is more convenient to introduce the auxiliary field, σ and π, and
rewrite the action as,

where the trace, tr, stands for the sum over the Dirac indices and ω is an arbitrary mass scale. Due
to the chiral symmetry of the action, we set π = 0 without loss of generality. Then the expectation

If the auxiliary field, σ, develops a non-vanishing expectation value, the fermion acquires a nonvanishing mass and the chiral symmetry is broken. Thus we regard the auxiliary field, σ, as an order
parameter for the chiral symmetry breaking. It is noted that the effective potential (7) coincides
with the one in the GN model [2]. The GN model has the discrete Z2 chiral symmetry under the
transformation ψ → γ 5 ψ. Since a continuous symmetry cannot be broken in two dimensions, we
employ the GN model and evaluate the discrete chiral symmetry breaking in two dimensions.
We usually shift the origin of the effective potential to zero and remove the divergent zero-point
energy,

Since the four-fermion interaction is not renormalizable in four dimensions, the renormalized effective potential is still divergent for D = 4. We regard the model at 4 − ε dimensions as a regularized

If this expression has a real and non-vanishing value, the fermion mass is dynamically generated.
To find the critical value of the coupling constant we take the massless limit m0 → 0 of equation
(14). Then we get
λcr = λc .

(15)

When the four-fermion coupling, λr , is larger than the critical one, λcr , non-vanishing fermion mass
is generated and the chiral symmetry is broken. In Fig. 1 the critical coupling, λcr , is plotted as a
function of the spacetime dimension, D. Above the line the four-fermion coupling is strong enough
to break the chiral symmetry. As is observed in the figure, only the broken phase is realized in two
dimensions.
In Fig. 2 we draw the behavior of the dynamically generated fermion mass, m0 , as a function
of the renormalized coupling, λr . For λr < λcr the mass scale, m1 , is defined by the absolute value

respectively. Since the renormalization scale, µ, and the renormalized coupling, λr , are not independent at the leading order of the 1/N expansion, the parameters, µ, and, λr , are rewritten by m0 ,
and m1 . We discuss the phase structure of the four-fermion interaction model, starting from the
effective potential (16) and (17). Since the critical coupling is vanishing, λcr = 0, in two dimensions,
only the expression (16) is adopted for D = 2.

Four-fermion interaction model on MD−1 ⊗ S 1

To study the finite size effect on the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking we consider the fourfermion interaction model (3) on a flat spacetime, MD−1 ⊗ S 1 , with one spatial compact direction.
The Dirac field on the space is constrained by the size of the compactified space and the boundary
condition. We assign the following boundary condition in the compactified direction, xD−1 ,
ψ(x0 , . . . , xD−1 + L) = eiπδ ψ(x0 , . . . , xD−1 ),

(18)

where L is the length of the compactified space and δ is the phase factor. For the spatial compact
direction the phase factor, δ, is a parameter which is fixed by an environment outside of the system or
a non-trivial topology of the very early universe. According to the standard procedure on a compact
spacetime, Green functions on MD−1 ⊗ S 1 are given from the one on MD by the replacements

The boundary condition (18) is satisfied by introducing the discrete variable, ωn .
Applying these replacements on (7), we obtain the effective potential on MD at the leading

removed by the shift of the effective potential,
Ṽ (σ) ≡ V (σ) − V0 (σ = 0).
6

(21)

To compare the potential energy between the different size, L, and phase, δ we choose the subtracted
V0 (σ = 0) independent of the parameters L, δ and σ. As is showned in the Appendix, the effective
potential, Ṽ (σ), is represented in several forms. Since the expression which contains no divergent
function, C(L), is more convenient for the numerical analysis, we adopt the expression (44). Thus
the normalized effective potential reads,

The second term in the right hand side describes the finite size corrections with the boundary

The effective potential (22) depends on the coupling constant, λr , and the renormalization scale,

where we set α = 0 and 1 for λr > λcr and λr < λcr , respectively. The reason for this replacement
is to reduce the number of parameters. We split the expression with respect to the critical value of
the coupling constant, λcr , which is defined on MD . Though the model on MD is different from
the one on MD−1 ⊗ S 1 as long as the length L is finite, the normalization by m0 (m1 ) gives one
criterion in considering the compactified model.
Here we focus on the δ dependence and numerically evaluate the effective potential. It is known
that the broken chiral symmetry is restored by the finite size effect for the anti-periodic boundary
condition, δ = 1 and the finite size effect enhances the chiral symmetry breaking for the periodic
boundary condition, δ = 0 [8, 6, 9]. Typical behavior of the effective potential is shown in Figs. 3
4 for fixed lengths, Lm0 = 2.5 and Lm1 = 2.5. Because of the periodicity of the effective potential,
Ṽ (σ)|δ = Ṽ (σ)|±δ+2lπ for an arbitrary integer l, it is enough to study the effective potential within
the interval, 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1.
In Fig. 3 it is observed that the effective potential has a non-trivial minimum for any dimensions.
The non-trivial minimum shows the existence of the ground state which breaks the chiral symmetry.
In Fig. 4 the broken phase is observed at (D, δ) = (2.5, 0.05), (3, 0.05) around the periodic boundary
condition. As is shown in Figs. 3, 4, the value of the effective potential at the minimum, Vmin ,
decreases with the phase, δ, approaching the anti-periodic boundary condition, δ = 1. We plot the
minimum value, Vmin , as a function of the U(1) phase δ in Fig. 5. If the U(1) phase δ is a dynamical
valuable, the stable state is found at the anti-periodic boundary condition, δ = 1.
In Fig. 6 the minimum value, Vmin , is plotted as a function of the length of the compactified
space, L. In the figure we show the typical behavior of the minimum for D = 3. It monotonically
increases and decreases for a small and large δ, respectively. For a specific phase (δ = 0.46 . . . for

We numerically solve equation (25) and draw the behavior of the dynamically generated mass as
a function of δ for fixed lengths in Fig. 7. It is clearly seen that the generated mass, m, monotonically
decreases as the phase, δ, approaches the unity, δ → 1. In the weak coupling case, λr < λcr , with
Lm1 = 2.5 it is observed that the fermion mass disappears above a critical value of δ and the second
order phase transition takes place for D = 2.5 and 3. Only the symmetric phase, m = 0, is observed
for D = 3.5. In Fig. 8 the generated mass is plotted as a function of the length, L, for typical δ at
D = 3. The finite size effect restores the broken chiral symmetry for δ = 1 and enhances the chiral
symmetry breaking for δ = 0. For intermediate δ combined behavior is observed. We checked that
the finite size phase transition is always of the second order.
Since the phase transition is of the second order, the phase boundary is found at the massless
limit, m → 0, of the gap equation. We adopt the expression (48) and derive the explicit expression
for the critical length, Lcr , as a function of the phase, δ. Differentiating equation (48) with respect
to σ, the divergent function, C(L), is dropped and the gap equation reads

The critical length, Lcr , which divides the symmetric and broken phases is obtained by taking the
massless limit, m → 0, of (26), At the limit the summation in (26) is described by the Hurwitz zeta
function, ζ(z, a), which is defined in (54) and the critical length, Lcr , is given by

In the case of the anti-periodic condition, δ = 1, this formula coincides with the one for the critical
temperature on MD which is derived in [21].
We numerically calculate the critical length and draw the phase diagram in Fig. 9. For λr > λcr
the symmetric phase is observed around δ = 1 where the broken chiral symmetry is restored by the
finite size effect. Only the broken phase is observed for the periodic boundary condition, δ = 0. In
the weak coupling case λr < λcr the chiral symmetry is broken around δ = 0. The critical length is
divergent at δ = 0 for D = 3. As long as the length is finite L < ∞, the chiral symmetry is always
broken in the periodic boundary condition, δ = 0, for 2 < D ≤ 3. Since the finite effect vanishes at
the limit L → ∞, the symmetric phase appears at the L → ∞ limit for δ = 0. The situation is also
observed in the behavior of the fermion mass for the lines at δ = 0 in Fig. 8.
The D-dependences of the chiral symmetry breaking are useful to understand the phase structure. As is shown in Fig. 10 (a), the chiral symmetry breaking is enhanced as the phase approaches
from δ = 1 to 0. It is clearly seen in Fig. 10 (b) that the broken phase appears around the periodic
boundary condition, δ = 0, even in the weak coupling case λr < λcr . It is denoted that equation
(27) at δ = 0 is defined only for 3 ≤ D < 4. In the case of the periodic boundary condition in lower
dimensions 2 ≤ D < 3 the symmetric phase only realizes at the L → ∞ limit.

Casimir effect

In the previous section the effective potential on the ground state is described as a function of
the size of the compactified spatial direction L and the U(1) phase δ at the boundary. As is
known as the Casimir effect [18, 19, 20], the L dependence of the total zero-point energy induces
a pressure between parallel plates, a distance L apart. At first the Casimir force was introduced
as an attractive force between metallic plates. T. H. Boyer has found a repulsive force between
the perfectly conducting and perfectly permeable plates [22]. The connection of the attractive
and repulsive forces has been studied for a perfect electromagnetic conductor in [23]. Some useful
formulae to calculate the Casimir force has been developed in arbitrary dimensions in [24]. In a
four-fermion interaction model the sign-flip phenomenon has been found in [25].
In the four-fermion interaction model on MD−1 ⊗ S 1 the Casimir force, F (L, δ), is given as a
function of L and δ. It is derived as the first derivative of the effective potential with respect to L
at the minimum, σ = m,
F (L, δ) = −

∂ Ṽ (σ)
∂L

.

(28)

σ=m

As is observed in Fig. 6, the slope is negative (positive) for a small (large) δ and the repulsive
(attractive) force induces.
Substituting equation (23) into (28), we obtain the Casimir force at the leading order of the
1/N expansion.

where we set α = 0 and 1 for λr > λcr and λr < λcr , respectively. The fermion mass, m, is derived
by solving the gap equation (25).
In Fig. 11 we plot the behavior of the Casimir force as a function of the phase δ for fixed lengths.
As typical lengths, we choose Lmα = 1 and 1.5. The sharp bends on the lines, it is clearly observed
in two dimensions, D = 2, for λ > λcr , correspond to the critical value for the chiral symmetry
breaking. It is shown that the Casimir force is repulsive near the periodic boundary condition,
δ = 0, and the force decreases monotonically as approaching the anti-periodic boundary condition,
δ = 1. The sign of F (L, δ) changes around δ ∼ 0.5 for D = 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5. The attractive force
realizes near the anti-periodic boundary condition.
In Fig. 12 the behavior of the Casimir force is plotted as a function of L around the sign-flip
value, δ ∼ 0.5. We observe that the force is divergent and disappears at the limit L → 0 and L → ∞,
respectively. The sign flips in two cases D = 2, 2.5 at δ = 0.45 for a strong coupling, λ > λcr . In
these cases the Casimir force changes from attractive to repulsive as the length increases. Thus the
length where the sign flips is unstable. No stable length is realized for the four-fermion interaction
model. In the other cases the sign-flip is not observed.

The sign-flip points for the Casimir force are found by solving F (L, δ) = 0. In the symmetric
phase, m = 0, the momentum integral in (29) is described by the polylogarithm, Lis (z), which is
defined in (55). Then equation (29) reduces to

Thus the sign-flip points in the symmetric phase are found to be

(31)

Since this equation is independent of the length, L, the U(1) phase, δ, fixes the sign-flip points. We
give the phase δ at the sign-flip points for D = 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5 in Tab. 1. In the broken phase we
numerically evaluate equation (29) with the gap equation (25) and find the solution for F (L, δ) = 0.

In Fig. 13 we draw the boundary lines dividing the repulsive force and attractive force on the
L − δ plane. In the symmetric phase the boundary is fixed by the phase, δ, and described by a
vertical lines. As is shown in Fig. 9, the chiral symmetry is restored when the length, L, is smaller
than the critical one for λr > λcr . In Fig. 13 (a), we observe that the boundary is represented
by vertical line in the symmetric phase. Above the critical length, the length at the boundary
increases as δ approaches 0.5. The dynamically generated fermion mass extends the domain where
the repulsive force is induced. In Fig. 13 (b), the sign-flip points are found on the symmetric phase
and the boundary is represented by vertical lines.

Conclusions

We have studied dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in four-fermion interaction models on MD−1 ⊗
S 1 with the U(1)-valued boundary condition. The models are often considered associated with a
superconducting ring, non-trivial topology at the early universe and compact extra dimensions. Assuming the homogeneous condensation and using the zeta function regularization, we have obtained
the explicit expression of the effective potential for the fermion and anti-fermion composite field in
the leading order of the 1/N expansion.
The system is classified into two cases based on the chiral symmetry on MD . In the strong
coupling case, λr > λcr , the composite field develops a non-vanishing expectation value and the
chiral symmetry is dynamically broken, while the expectation value for the composite field vanishes
and the ground state maintains chiral symmetry in the weak coupling case, λr > λcr , on MD . In
the specific expressions these cases are distinguished by the mass scale, m0 and m1 . No constraints
is theoretically defined for the mass scale and it is fixed for each phenomenon.
In this paper we focus on the topological effect stemming from the boundary condition. The
effective potential was numerically evaluated on MD−1 ⊗ S 1 as the U(1) phase, δ, varies. By
observing the effective potential at the minimum, the stable state with respect to the U(1) phase
is found at the anti-periodic boundary condition, δ = 1. We calculated the dynamically generated
fermion mass as a function of δ and checked that only the second order phase transition takes place.
The phase diagram was shown on the δ − L and D − L planes for λr > λcr and λr < λcr in Fig. 9.
To find a phenomenological consequence the Casimir force has been investigated in the models
on MD−1 ⊗ S 1 . As is pointed out in [25], the sign of the force flips as δ varies from 0 to 1. We
found the explicit expression for the sign-flip points in the symmetric phase and the boundary lines
dividing the repulsive force and attractive force on the L − δ plane. In Fig. 13 (a) the critical points
for chiral symmetry breaking are clearly observed as sharp bends on the lines.
The derived expressions for the effective potential reduce to the known results in the previous
works at the periodic (δ = 0) and anti-periodic (δ = 1) boundary conditions [6, 8, 9]. It should be
noted that the imaginary chemical potential introduces similar expressions [26].
In the present work we assume the homogeneous expectation value for the composite field and
study the ground state by calculating the effective potential. In finite size space-times, inhomogeneous states may be realized. The inhomogeneous states are found by observing the effective action
on MD−1 ⊗ S 1 or extend the analysis developed in two dimensions [17]. Four-fermion interaction
models in a curved geometory with a non-trivial topology are also interesting to find some phenomenological consequences at the early universe [27]. We hope to report on the inhomogeneous
condensation in four-fermion interaction models on MD−1 ⊗ S 1 and a curved geometory in future.

Since the second term of the right hand side in (44) is finite, the divergent zero-point energy is
removed by subtracting V0 (σ = 0). Therefore the expression of the effective potential (22) is
derived.
