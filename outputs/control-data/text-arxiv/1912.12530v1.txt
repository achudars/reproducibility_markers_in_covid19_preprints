SU(1,1) interferometry, proposed in a classic 1986 paper by Yurke, McCall, and Klauder [Phys. Rev. A 33,
4033 (1986)], involves squeezing, displacing, and then unsqueezing two bosonic modes. It has, over the past
decade, been implemented in a variety of experiments. Here I take SU(1,1) interferometry apart, to see how and
why it ticks. SU(1,1) interferometry arises naturally as the two-mode version of active-squeezing-enhanced,
back-action-evading measurements aimed at detecting the phase-space displacement of a harmonic oscillator
subjected to a classical force. Truncating an SU(1,1) interferometer, by omitting the second two-mode squeezer,
leaves a prototype that uses the entanglement of two-mode squeezing to detect and characterize a disturbance
on one of the two modes from measurement statistics gathered from both modes.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum metrology is a field of highly sophisticated theoretical analyses [1], but few applications. The reason is that an
experimenter or a technology developer is generally quite reluctant to incorporate technically difficult quantum techniques,
preferring instead to push tried and true classical technologies to their limits before considering quantum enhancements. Only
when the back is against the wall are quantum techniques adopted.
The chief example of quantum metrology making a big difference is in the LIGO/VIRGO interferometric gravitational-wave
detectors, where squeezed-vacuum light is being injected into the output (dark or antisymmetric) port during the current (O3)
observing run [2, 3]. The event rate in O3 seems to be 5–10 times greater than in the first two observing runs (O1 and O2) [4];
some of this improvement can be attributed to small increases in laser power and to sensitivity enhancements in VIRGO, but at
least some of it comes from employing squeezed light. The LIGO noise data [2] indicate an expected increase in event rate by a
factor of roughly 1.5 from the use of squeezed light.
This injection of light in a squeezed-vacuum state into the dark port, proposed nearly forty years ago [5], reduces shot noise
and is equivalent to increasing the laser power. Not originally planned for this stage of Advanced LIGO, squeezing became
nearly mandatory for sensitivity enhancements—those backs against a wall!—when Advanced LIGO fell short of the design
goal for circulating power [6, 7] in O1 [8], with only marginal power increases achieved in O2 [9]. Indeed, as forecast somewhat
cheekily in [5], when increases in power are no longer easy, “Experimenters might then be forced to learn how to very gently
squeeze the vacuum before it can contaminate the light in their interferometers.”
After initial demonstrations of shot-noise reduction in interferometers in the 1980s [10, 11], the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the VIRGO Collaboration supported the development of single-mode squeezing technology at the audio frequencies
needed in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors [12, 13]. This multi-decade effort of technology development led to
demonstrations of shot-noise reduction using squeezed light in large gravitational-wave interferometers, first in the GEO600
interferometer [14] and then in the LIGO Hanford interferometer [15] just before Initial LIGO was shut down for upgrades to
Advanced LIGO. This squeezing technology now provides the squeezed light for use in observing run O3, where for the first
time, squeezed light has enhanced the ability to detect actual gravitational-wave events [2, 3]. Given the advanced state of techniques for generating squeezed light, it seems likely that squeezing will be a part of all future interferometric gravitational-wave
detectors.
There is now another use of squeezing for enhancing an extremely challenging fundamental-physics experiment, that being
the task of detecting the dark-matter axion field. The local axions are thought to be in a highly populated, narrowband condensate
that makes up the Galaxy’s dark-matter halo and interacts with the electromagnetic field via a φa E · B coupling [16–18]. This
coupling, for an electromagnetic cavity immersed in a large static magnetic field, becomes a linear interaction between the axion
field and the electric field. The axion field acts as a volume-filling classical current density that radiates into the cavity. Detecting
axions becomes a problem of linear force detection, i.e., of detecting the excitation of a cavity mode by a weak “classical force”
that displaces the mode’s complex amplitude of oscillation.
The axions are essentially at rest in the Galaxy with a velocity dispersion given by the virial velocity vG ' 200 km/s
in the galactic gravitational field. Thus the axion field excites a cavity at the rest-mass frequency, νa = ma c2 /h =
250 MHz (ma c2 /1 µeV), within a narrow fractional bandwith ∆ν/νa ' 12 (vG /c)2 ' 2 × 10−7 , corresponding to a coherence time τ = 1/∆ν ' 5 × 106 τa , where τa = 1/νa is the axion period and thus the period of the cavity mode. One

can think of the axion field as exciting the cavity coherently during each time interval of duration τa , but choosing a different phase for each such time interval. The axion field is spatially coherent over a scale given by the de Broglie wavelength
λdB = h/ma vG = (c/vG )λa ' 1.5 × 103 λa , where λa = c/νa is the electromagnetic wavelength corresponding to frequency νa .
A preferred mass range for the axion, ma ' 1 µeV–100 µeV, fortuitously puts the axion rest-mass frequency at microwave
frequencies. Present experiments [19, 20] look for excitations of a mode of a microwave cavity whose resonant frequency is
progressively tuned across a wide bandwidth to search across a range of axion masses. These cavities have ringdown times
somewhat shorter than the axion coherence time. Although squeezing can provide an advantage even in this situation [21],
the real advantage of squeezing comes into play when the cavities are improved to have a bandwidth much narrower than
the axion bandwidth. Then it pays to measure the displacement of the microwave mode’s complex amplitude over an axion
coherence time, a time over which cavity damping can be neglected and squeezed microwaves suffer little degradation. Indeed,
once in this regime, the best practical alternative for improving sensitivity—again, backs against the wall—is to use backaction-evading measurements of a single quadrature displacement of the cavity mode [22–29] or, equivalently, to use active
squeezing of that quadrature to achieve the same effect [30]. The experiment becomes a version of a back-action-evading (or
quantum nondemolition) measurement of the displacement of one quadrature component of a harmonic oscillator, in this case, a
microwave-cavity mode.
To measure both quadratures of the axion-induced displacement, one can use two cavities that are within a spatial coherence length of one another, or one can use an equivalent scheme in which only one of the cavities is subjected to the axion
displacement, but the two cavities are coupled by putting them in a two-mode squeezed state. This latter idea, proposed in the
axion context by [31], is equivalent to using an SU(1,1) interferometer of the sort introduced in a classic 1986 paper by Yurke,
McCall, and Klauder [32]. That, at last, brings us around to the subject of this paper: to examine SU(1,1) interferometry and the
prominent role it and variants of it play in quantum metrology and quantum information.
Over the last decade, a number of experimental groups have implemented SU(1,1) interferometry in a variety of forms [33–
44]. A brief review of SU(1,1) interferometry within the context of other contemporary uses of squeezed light, which touches
on some of questions considered in this paper, can be found in [45].
This paper reviews, in Sec. II, the ideas behind SU(1,1) interferometry and formulates two distinct scenarios for its use. The
first scenario involves detecting itinerant signals that are applied to persistent modes, by which I mean that the modes must be
checked repeatedly to provide evidence of a signal that acts only occasionally or with varying amplitude and phase. The second
scenario, involves a persistent signal (or disturbance) that can be consulted by itinerant modes that successively probe the signal.
The first scenario, examined in Sec. III, is the province of high-resolution, back-action-evading measurements of a quadrature
displacement produced by a “classical force” acting on a persistent mode. The discussion in Sec. III B leads up to showing that an
SU(1,1) interferometer is a squeezing-enhanced version of back-action-evading measurements for detecting both (orthogonal)
quadrature displacements, with the enhancement coming from the fact that two-mode squeezing is noiseless, phase-sensitive
amplification and de-amplification of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) variables of the two modes.
In the second scenario, which occupies Sec. IV, the goal is not high sensitivity in a single shot, but rather reliable detection or
characterization of a persistent disturbance over many trials by taking advantage of the modal entanglement within an SU(1,1)
interferometer. This scenario is illustrated by an example from my own recent work, a protocol [46] for characterizing a lossy,
passive linear optical network in randomized boson sampling [47].
The bottom line is that SU(1,1) interferometry is not really about interferometry at all. In the first scenario, the use of
SU(1,1) operations is all about high-resolution linear force detection using the noiseless amplification and de-amplification of
squeezers as the primary resource. The prominence of noiseless linear amplification and de-amplification and measurement of
linear observables prompts a renaming of SU(1,1) interferometers as SU(1,1) displacement detectors. The second scenario is all
about reliable detection and/or characterization of a disturbance on one mode using the entanglement introduced by a two-mode
squeezer as the primary resource. In this second scenario, the omission of the second two-mode squeezer severs any connection
with interferometry.
Much, perhaps all, of what is discussed in this paper is not new. The purpose of the paper is to bring together a wide variety
of SU(1,1)-based measurement techniques, so that one can easily see the connections among and distinctions between them.

SU(1,1) INTERFEROMETRY

Yurke, McCall, and Klauder [32] introduced the notion of SU(1,1) interferometry by replacing the beamsplitters of a standard
SU(2) interferometer with active elements now called two-mode squeezers.
A standard interferometer uses beamsplitters acting on a pair of modes, a and b, to send waves down two different paths and
to bring those waves into interference after they have received phase shifts that one wants to detect. A standard interferometer is

FIG. 1: (a) Mach-Zehnder interferometer as a prototype for SU(2) interferometry. The operations in the interferometer are generated by the
Schwinger operators J1 , J2 , and J3 of Eq. (2.1), which obey the angular-momentum commutation relations (2.2) and thus generate the group
SU(2). The interferometer is powered by a laser that prepares a coherent state in the (horizontal) input mode a; the overall phase reference
for the interferometer is the phase of this coherent state. The laser light is split between two arms by the initial 50-50 beamsplitter B =
†
†
†
†
e(âb̂ −â b̂)π/4 = e−iJ2 π/2 and is then subjected to equal and opposite phase shifts in the two arms, ei(â â−b̂ b̂)(π/4+ϕ/2) = eiJ3 π/2 eiJ3 ϕ .
†
The beams are recombined at a second 50-50 beamsplitter B , which converts the differential phase shift ϕ to amplitude changes in the output
beams; these are detected at two photodetectors, the photocounts are differenced, and thus the detection is a measurement of â† â − b̂† b̂ = 2J3 .
The differential phase shift eiJ3 π/2 is included so that the interferometer operates, when ϕ = 0, with equal amounts of laser light exiting the
two output ports; it could be included in either the input or the output beamsplitter. The overall transformation through the interferometer,
eiJ2 π/2 eiJ3 π/2 eiJ3 ϕ e−iJ2 π/2 = e−iJ1 π/2 e−iJ1 ϕ , is a beamsplitter whose transmission and reflection are changed from 50-50 by the signal
ϕ. To reduce the shot noise that limits measuring ϕ, one injects squeezed vacuum into the (vertical) input port b (the dark or antisymmetric
port), with the reduced-noise (squeezed) quadrature being the one that is out of phase with the laser light after passage through the initial
beamsplitter. (b) SU(1,1) interferometer. The SU(2) generator J2 is replaced by the SU(1,1) generator K2 , one of the three operators of
Eq. (2.4) that generate the group SU(1,1); to be precise, the beamsplitters of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer are replaced by two-mode
† †
squeezers S2 (r) = er(âb̂−â b̂ ) = e−2iK2 r . The squeezers being active elements, the interferometer doesn’t need to be powered, so can have
vacuum inputs. The overall phase reference is set by the phase of whatever pump beam drives the two-mode squeezers. After the first squeezer,

the signal is applied: it consists of phase-space displacements, D(γ ∗ ) = eγ â −γâ on mode a and D(γ) = eγ b̂ −γ b̂ on mode b. The second
two-mode squeezer acts oppositely to the first; in the absence of the signal, the modes are restored to vacuum. The signal is detected by
measuring two EPR variables of the output mode, as is discussed in Sec. III B.

This is a good place for the reader to consult Fig. 1, which summarizes the transition from SU(2) to SU(1,1) interferometry
in language like that used by Yurke, McCall, and Klauder. In considering applications of SU(1,1) interferometry in quantum
metrology and, more generally, in quantum information science, it helps, right at the start, to distinguish two different scenarios.
The first scenario involves detecting itinerant signals that are applied to persistent modes: the modes persist in the laboratory
and must be checked repeatedly to provide evidence of a signal that acts occasionally and unpredictably. In this situation, one
can think in terms of a sequence of time intervals, during each of which the modes begin in an appropriate quantum state and
are measured at the end to determine whether a signal has acted.1 The crucial point is that the measurement itself prepares the
persistent modes in an appropriate quantum state, ready for the next time interval and the next measurement; this is the defining
feature of back-action-evading measurements. To visualize this scenario in the SU(1,1) interferometer of Fig. 1(b), one should
imagine the measured modes at the output of the interferometer circling around to become the input for the next round.
This first scenario is thus about subvacuum-noise, back-action-evading measurements of a quadrature component of a persistent mode to detect a “classical force” that, acting linearly on the mode, displaces its complex amplitude of oscillation. Proposed
for detecting the action of a gravitational wave on a mode of oscillation of a several-ton metallic bar, such back-action-evading
measurements are equally suited to metrological applications of the wide range of high-Q mechanical oscillators being developed
in optomechanics [48–50] and to axion detection that uses a persistent mode of a microwave resonator.
Subvacuum-noise quadrature measurements prepare the persistent mode(s) in a squeezed state, with no active squeezing
required. Active squeezing gets into the picture when the available quadrature measurements do not have subvacuum-noise
resolution. In that situation, active squeezing achieves subvacuum-noise resolution by using its noiseless, phase-sensitive amplification and de-amplification of quadrature components [51] to make a quadrature displacement stand out above whatever noise
governs the quadrature measurement [30]. These possibilities are explored in detail in Sec. III.
The second scenario for SU(1,1) interferometry involves a persistent signal (or disturbance) that can be consulted over and
over again by a succession of itinerant modes. The goal in this second scenario, which is the subject of Sec. IV, is not high
sensitivity in a single shot, but rather the ability over many trials to detect reliably and/or to characterize a disturbance. In this
scenario, one should think of the itinerant modes as being demolished on detection, with new modes injected in each round to
probe the disturbance. One can omit as irrelevant the second two-mode squeezer in the SU(1,1) interferometer of Fig. 1, thus
reducing the device to what is called a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer [37, 38, 41]. The key feature of these protocols is that
one seeks to detect over many shots a disturbance to one of the modes by making measurements on the other mode or on both
modes, with the entangled correlations introduced by the two-mode squeezer making this possible.

BACK-ACTION-EVADING MEASUREMENTS: ITINERANT SIGNAL, PERSISTENT MODES
A.

BAE meaurements of quadrature displacement

Focus now on measurements of a quadrature displacements of a persistent mode a, as in bar gravitational-wave detection or
axion detection, and write the modal annilation operator in terms of position and momentum quadrature components:
1
â = √ (x̂ + ip̂) .
2

(3.1)

Often, what is actually performed, especially for microwave modes, is a continuous measurement with a bandwidth given by the inverse of the duration of the
time intervals, but it is easier to think in terms of and to draw quantum circuits for a sequence of time intervals.

FIG. 2: (a) Sequence of BAE position-quadrature measurements of a persistent mode. The mode begins,
say, in vacuum, as shown here,
√
and is subjected to a sequence of position-quadrature (x) measurements, each with resolution σ < 1/ 2. Successive pairs of measurements
detect the x component of a phase-space displacement, represented by the displacement operator D(γ) of Eq. (3.4), acting on the mode
between the two measurements. In the language of quantum circuits, the essence of back-action-evading measurements is that there is a
persistent mode, represented by a quantum wire that persists through the measurements; each measurement, whose outcome x is represented
by the vertical, double (classical) wire, prepares the mode in a squeezed state, ready for the next measurement to reveal an intervening
phase-space displacement. (b) Phase-space depiction of the initial measurement in (a). The mode, initially in vacuum, represented by the
black, circular noise ellipse, is subjected to a position-quadrature measurement, whose outcome x is chosen from a Gaussian distribution with
variance σ 2 + Σ20 = σ 2 + 12 . After the measurement, the mode is left in a squeezed state, represented by the blue noise ellipse, which has
√
position-quadrature variance . σ 2 . The complex phase-space displacement γ = (γ1 + iγ2 )/ 2 moves the mode to the red noise ellipse.
A subsequent position-quadrature measurement detects γ1 with resolution ' σ. As the protocol proceeds, the modal state becomes highly
squeezed, approaching a position-quadrature eigenstate;
it is then easy to see that successive pairs
√ of measurements determine the intervening
√
position-quadrature displacement with resolution 2σ. The analysis in the text shows that this 2σ resolution holds for all pairs of successive
measurements.

A subtle, but important point is that all these operators are constants in the absence of the signal one wishes to detect; i.e., one
has gone to a rotating frame in which the free, harmonic evolution at the modal frequency ω is removed from â, x̂, and p̂. When
one talks about measuring quadrature components or about measuring the complex amplitude of a mode, one is talking about
measuring these constant quantities. This is different from measuring the position or momentum, which co-evolve harmonically
at the modal frequency.
Measuring the constant quadrature components is the crucial feature of back-action-evading (BAE) measurements [22–29].
When measuring modes of the electromagnetic field, at microwave or optical frequencies, the natural measurements are measurements of these constant quantities: homodyne measurement is a measurement of a quadrature component, and heterodyne
measurement reports a mode’s constant complex amplitude. In contrast, for mechanical oscillators, it is natural to think in terms
of coupling to the position or momentum, not to quadrature components; in this situation, measuring a quadrature component
involves modulating the coupling at the oscillator frequency and averaging over several oscillator periods.
Ideas of subvacuum measurement resolution have been mainly used on electromagnetic modes, where homodyne and heterodyne, the natural measurements, measure conserved quantities. This has served to obscure the distinctive feature of BAE
measurements for some [52]. The point of back-action-evading (or quantum nondemolition) measurements is not that the measurement is projective or that the measured system is left untouched except for the measurement back action, but rather that the
persistent system in the state left by measurement is ready to be used again in a protocol of repeated measurements that evade
the noise left by the back action of previous measurements. This generally means, as here, measuring a conserved quantity,
but for a pair of modes, it can mean measuring harmonically evolving observables in what is called a quantum-mechanics-free
subsystem [53].
I assume throughout that the measurements of quadrature components dominate the persistent mode’s other couplings to
the external world, this being the regime where subvacuum-noise resolution can be achieved. In practice, this means that the
measurements dominate the effects of finite temperature and dissipation, which are therefore ignored.
Consider now a sequence of measurements of the position-quadrature component. The measurements are described by Kraus
operators,

Vacuum resolution, which I here call, following [54], the quantum noise limit (QNL), is set by the size of zero-point fluctuations
and is thus given by σ 2 = 1/2. I assume here that the quadrature measurements have resolution better than the QNL, i.e.,
σ 2 < 1/2.
Between measurements, a force might act on the system, its effect on the mode described by a displacement operator,

The phase-space displacement of the complex amplitude, γ = (γ1 + iγ) / 2, divides into position and momentum quadrature
displacements, γ1 and γ2 . Figure 2 translates the sequence of measurements into a quantum circuit and depicts graphically
how the initial measurement on a vacuum input leaves the system in a squeezed state that can be used to detect a subsequent
quadrature displacement with sensitivity ∼ σ.
I sketch here the analysis of a sequence of BAE homodyne measurements. If the persistent mode begins in a pure Gaussian
state, such as vacuum, it remains in a pure Gaussian state throughout the entire sequence. After n measurements, the system is in
state |ψn i, with a Gaussian wave function whose position-quadrature mean and variance are hx̂in and Σ2n . The next phase-space
displacement D(γn+1 ) changes the mean value to hx̂in + γ1,n+1 ; the position-quadrature probability distribution is

The estimator (3.14) now takes the form γ1,n = γ1.n + σWn − σWn−1 , clearly showing how the factor of 2 in the estimator variance (3.15) arises from equal contributions from the two successive measurements required to estimate an intervening
displacement.
BAE homodyne measurements are by themselves sufficient for sub-QNL detection of a classical force—no active squeezing
required—provided the measurements are done at a subvacuum noise level. Active squeezing comes into play if one doesn’t
have the ability to do such sensitive measurements; then active squeezing can substitute for more sensitive measurements. To
see this, let’s first get a little notation straight, introducing the single-mode squeeze operator,

(3.24)

S1† p̂S1 = p̂ er .

(3.25)

which transforms the quadrature components according to
S1† x̂S1 = x̂ e−r ,

The transformation of the position quadrature implies that S1 |yi = e−r/2 |ye−r i. Consider now how the single-mode squeeze

The circuit equivalence in Fig. 3(a) can be used to convert the BAE measurement circuit of Fig. 2(a) to an equivalent form,
shown in Fig. 4, which uses active squeezing and quadrature measurements at the QNL in place of the high-resolution BAE
measurements of Fig. 2(a). It is easy to see why the circuit of Fig. 4 works. In the Heisenberg picture, the quadrature components

FIG. 3: (a) BAE homodyne measurement of the position quadrature x with resolution σ = e−r / 2 is equivalent to conjugating with squeeze
operators a measurement of x with vacuum resolution. This substitutes active squeezing for measurements with subvacuum-noise resolution.
(b) Phase-space depiction of the active squeezing circuit in (a). Suppose the mode begins in vacuum, represented by the black, circular noise
ellipse. Unsqueezing x (S1† ) produces the green noise ellipse. A measurement at the QNL, whose outcome x is chosen from a Gaussian
distribution with variance 21 + 12 e2r = 12 + 1/4σ 2 , leaves the mode in a state with the purple noise ellipse. Squeezing x (S1 ) then leaves
the mode with the blue noise ellipse, identical to the blue noise
√ ellipse after a BAE measurement on vacuum with resolution σ in Fig. 2(b).
(c) Heterodyne measurement, with outcome α = (x + ip)/ 2, can be used in place of BAE homodyne measurement to achieve sub-QNL
resolution. The left circuit conjugates a heterodyne measurement, which projects onto coherent states |αi, with squeeze operators; the right
circuit is the equivalent measurement
that projects onto squeezed states |α0 , ri = S1 |αi. The analysis in the text shows that these measurements
√
achieve the same resolution, 2σ, as BAE homodyne measurements, with the advantage that the weak determination of the p quadrature keeps
the modal state from becoming highly squeezed as the protocol proceeds.

√
FIG. 4: Circuit for BAE measurement of position-quadrature displacements with resolution 2σ. In this circuit the high-resolution positionquadrature measurements of Fig. 2(a) are replaced with their equivalent from Fig. 3(a), i.e., measurements at the QNL conjugated by squeeze
operators. The squeeze operator S1 after a measurement squeezes the noise in x, the signal γ1 is imposed on top of this squeezed noise, and
the second squeezer S1† noiselessly amplifies both the signal and the noise. The amplified signal γ1 er then stands out above the vacuum-level
noise associated with the measurements. The discussion in the text shows that the heterodyne measurements of Fig. 3(c) can be substituted for
the QNL-resolution position-quadrature measurements without any loss of sensitivity in estimating the displacement γ1 .

The position-quadrature displacement, smaller than the vacuum level, is imposed on top of squeezed noise, and the second
squeezer acts as a noiseless, phase-sensitive amplifier that amplifies the signal so that it can be detected above the vacuum-level
noise from the measurements; indeed, the overall effect on the position quadrature is to displace it by a signal amplified by the
factor er . For the momentum quadrature, just the opposite occurs, and the momentum-quadrature displacement is de-amplified
below the vacuum noise.
The circuit in Fig. 4, has been implemented by Burd et al. [30] to detect one quadrature of the motion of a mechanical oscillator that is a single 25 Mg+ ion oscillating in an ion trap; the authors stress that the technique relies on the phase-sensitive
de-amplification and amplification of squeezing as a substitute for high-resolution measurements. Something very much like the
circuit in Fig. 4 has been used by Malnou et al. [21] to demonstrate an advantage to using active squeezing of a microwave mode
in the situation where dissipation dominates the measurements. A squeeze-displace-unsqueeze proposal that is essentially iden-

10
tical to Fig. 4 has been proposed for application to the collective spin of a large number of two-level atoms, with spin squeezing
(one-axis twisting) in place of quadrature squeezing and collective rotations in place of phase-space displacements [55].
In the next subsection, I build on the circuit of Fig. 4 to detect both quadrature components of the displacement γ by the
simple expedient of having two modes coupled to the same classical force and doing BAE measurements of x on one mode and
of p on the other. The resulting two-mode circuit can be transformed to an SU(1,1) interferometer.
Before getting to that, however, I digress briefly to note that the vacuum-resolution homodyne measurements we have considered up till now can be replaced,pwithout any loss of resolution, by heterodyne measurements. Heterodyne measurements
are represented by Kraus operators, dx dp/2π |αihα|, that project onto coherent states; they describe simultaneous, quantumlimited measurements
components [56, 57]. I label the quadrature outcomes by (α1 , α2 ) = (x, p), where
√
√ of both quadrature
α = (α1 + iα2 )/ 2 = (x + ip)/ 2. The corresponding POVM elements are dx dp |αihα|/2π. Squeezing a coherent state |αi
yields a squeezed state |α0 , ri,
S1 |αi = S1 D(α)|0i = D(α0 )S1 |0i = D(α0 )|0, ri = |α0 , ri ,

(3.28)

where |0, ri is a squeezed vacuum state, and |α0 , ri is a displaced squeezed state with mean complex amplitude

α0 = √ xe−r + iper = √ (x0 + ip0 ) .

(3.29)

These results mean that conjugating a heterodyne measurement with squeeze operators is equivalent to measuring in the squeezed
basis |α0 , ri, an equivalence depicted in quantum circuits in Fig. 3(c). Measuring in this squeezed basis is the sort of BAE
measurement originally contemplated by Hollenhorst [23]. It is as good a BAE measurement of the position quadrature as
the homodyne measurements considered up till now—and maybe better because the measurement of the p quadrature, poor
resolution though it has, keeps the back action onto p from increasing without bound and leading to states infinitely squeezed in
x. Moreover, measuring in the squeezed basis is certainly easier to analyze, as I now show, because the measurement outcomes
determine the post-measurement state.
For this brief analysis, let us focus on heterodyne measurements conjugated by squeezing. The nth heterodyne measurement,
with outcome αn , leaves the mode, after application of the following squeeze operator, in the squeezed state S1 |αn i = |αn0 , ri.
The displacement operator D(γn+1 ) and the subsequent unsqueezing by S1† leave the state S1† D(γn+1 )S1 |α
√n i just before the
(n + 1)th measurement. The outcomes of the (n + 1)th heterodyne measurement, αn+1 = (xn+1 + ipn+1 )/ 2, are thus drawn
from the Gaussian distribution,

This is the same as for BAE homodyne measurements, although here the factor of 2 comes from the extra half quantum of noise
in simultaneous measurements of both quadratures in heterodyne measurements [56, 57]. An astute reader might realize that
this analysis of squeezed heterodyne measurements is a rewrite of the Heisenberg-picture arrows of Eqs. (3.27); the Heisenbergpicture arrows provide a complete analysis for heterodyne measurements because the post-measurement state is determined by
the measurement outcomes.
The analysis so far confirms that the sensitivity to quadrature displacements is limited only by the available level of squeezing
or high-sensitivity BAE measurements. The practical limit on sensititivity
comes
dissipation and finite temp
p from including
p
perature, which together limit the (dimensionless) resolution to & kB T /~ω ωτ /Q = kB T τ /~Q, where ω is the modal
frequency and τ is the time between measurements.

FIG. 5: (a) Measuring both displacement quadratures on two modes subjected to the same displacement. On the top mode, one measures
the position quadrature x, and on the bottom mode, the momentum quadrature p. The squeezing enhancements are done oppositely on the
two modes so as to give subvacuum resolution for x on the top mode and for p on the bottom mode. (b) Equivalent circuit, obtained by
using the three equivalences displayed in Fig. 6. What emerges in this equivalent circuit is an SU(1,1) interferometer in the middle, with
the displacement signal
√ on mode b only, and
√ the interferometer surrounded by measurements at QNL resolution of the (commuting) EPR
variables (x̂a + x̂b )/ 2 and (−p̂a + p̂b )/ 2. The initial two-mode squeezer squeezes the noise in both EPR variables, the displacement
signal is imposed on top of this squeezed noise, and the second squeezer noiselessly amplifies the signal as it also amplifies the noise to the
vacuum level, ready for the QNL-level measurement of the EPR variables. The emphasis on noiseless linear amplification and de-amplification
and measurement of linear observables prompts reframing of the SU(1,1) interferometer, plus the measurement, as an SU(1,1) displacement
detector. There are two ways, without loss of sensitivity, to avoid measuring joint variables in (b). First, one can convert the EPR measurement
back to a measurement of quadrature components on separate modes by using the equivalence of Fig. 6(c); what this does is to surround the
two-mode squeezers with beamsplitters, thus putting them inside an SU(2) interferometer. Second, one can replace the QNL-level quadrature
measurements in (a) with heterodyne measurements, in which case the beamsplitter transformation to (b) leaves heterodyne measurements
with (formally) relabeled outcomes.

B.

Measurement of both components of quadrature displacement

This section considers measurements of both quadrature displacements. The obvious way to accomplish this is to have two
persistent modes subjected to the same classical force and to measure x on one and p on the other [23, 25–28]. In the case of
axion detection, for example, the discussion in the Introduction indicates that for two identical microwave cavities to see the same
displacement, they need to be well within about a thousand electromagnetic wavelengths of one another. The active-squeezing
version of the two circuits for measuring both quadrature displacements is shown in Fig. 5(a). The notable feature of this circuit
is that the squeezing of the persistent modes is equal and opposite to give subvacuum resolution for x measurements on one
mode and subvacuum resolution for p measurements on the other.
Converting the circuit of Fig. 5(a) to an SU(1,1) interferometer involves inserting B † B = I between all the elements and then
employing the three circuit identities of Fig. 6. The beamsplitter unitary here is the 50-50 beamsplitter of Fig. 1:
†

B = e(âb̂

−â† b̂)π/4

= e−iJ2 π/2 .

It transforms the modal annihilation operators according to

FIG. 6: Conjugating with the 50/50 beamsplitter B of Eq. (3.35) performs the following transformations:

√ 
i(−p̂a + p̂b )/ 2 . In (c), if one substitutes heterodyne measurements for the QNL-level quadrature measurements, then the beamsplitter
transformation leaves heterodyne measurements with relabeled outcomes on the right.

The key consequence of this transformation is the well-known fact, represented in Fig. 6(a), that B conjugates equal and opposite
squeezing of two modes to the two-mode squeeze operator (2.3):
S1 (r) ⊗ S1 (−r) = S1 (r) ⊗ S1† (r) = B † S2 (r)B .

(3.37)

In addition, it is easy to see that the common-mode displacement γ conjugates under B to a displacement of the b mode
[Fig. 6(b)]:
√
(3.38)
D(γ) ⊗ D(γ) = B † I ⊗ D( 2γ)B .
For the transformation of the quadrature measurements to measurement of the (joint) EPR variables, depicted in Fig. 6(c), it
is productive to introduce EPR variables as they are encoded in the (Hermitian) real and imaginary parts of complex operators:
1
1
â† + b̂ = √ (x̂a + x̂b ) + i √ (−p̂a + p̂b ) ,
2
2
i
1
†
â − b̂ = √ (x̂a − x̂b ) + √ (p̂a + p̂b ) .
2
2

(3.39)

Then the beamsplitter transformations (3.36) can be profitably rewritten as
x̂a + ip̂b = B † (â† + b̂)B ,
−x̂b + ip̂a = B † (â − b̂† )B .

(3.40)

The two EPR variables making up â† + b̂ transform to x̂a and p̂b and thus commute; likewise, the two EPR variables making up
â − b̂† transform to −x̂b and p̂a and thus commute.
The three circuit identities transform the independent-modes circuit of Fig. 5(a) to the mode-coupled circuit of Fig. 5(b),
which has an SU(1,1) interferometer at its heart. Because
of the equivalence, one knows that the SU(1,1) circuit can determine
√
both quadrature components of γ with resolution 2σ, but it helps to examine the SU(1,1) circuit directly to understand how
this works. For that purpose, notice that the two-mode squeeze operator conjugates modal annihilation operators according to
S2† âS2 = â cosh r − b̂† sinh r ,
S2† b̂S2 = b̂ cosh r − â† sinh r ,

FIG. 7: Back to BAE measurements and no active squeezing. The vacuum-resolution EPR
√ measurements of Fig. 5(b), enhanced by two-mode
squeeze operators, have been replaced by EPR measurements with resolution σ = er / 2, to create an equivalent circuit that relies only on
high-resolution measurements, instead of using active squeezing. The equivalence relies on the conjugation (3.42).

Using these relations, one can write Heisenberg-picture arrow diagrams like those in Eqs. (3.27),

Not surprisingly, the pairs of EPR variables do the same thing as the quadrature components do in the circuit of Fig. 4. The EPR
variables in â† + b̂ undergo noiseless de-amplification, acquisition of the displacement signal, which is below the vacuum level,
and then noiseless amplification so that the displacement signal stands out above vacuum-level noise. The use of noiseless amplification and de-amplification and of linear detection and the absence of any apparent role for interference prompts rethinking
the “interferometer” in SU(1,1) interferometer; I suggest that this device, including the measurements, is more suitably called
an SU(1,1) displacement detector.
An interesting feature of the circuit in Fig. 5(b) is that one needs only one mode coupled to the displacement signal; one can
measure both quadrature components of the displacement on that √
mode by measuring two of the joint EPR variables, which
commute and are displaced by the two quadrature components of 2γ. For instance, in axion detection, one cavity could be
immersed in a magnetic field and thus coupled to the axion field, while the other cavity, located anywhere, is outside the magnetic
field and thus not coupled to the axion field. Indeed, the circuit of Fig. 5(b) has been proposed and analyzed within the context
of axion detection and modeling of microwave devices by [31].
Another interesting point is that one can replace the vacuum-resolution quadrature measurements in the separate-modes circuit
of Fig. 5(a) with heterodyne measurements without loss of sensitivity. Then, when one transforms to the coupled-modes circuit
of Fig. 5(b), one finds that the beamsplitter transforms heterodyne measurements to heterodyne measurements, but with the
outcomes relabeled. The relevant transformation of coherent-state projectors follows from the transformation (3.36) of modal
annihilation operators:

(3.45)

The relabeling amounts to the statement that measuring all four quadrature components of the two modes is equivalent to measuring all four EPR variables. What all this means that in Figs. 5(b) and Fig. 8(a), one can substitute heterodyne measurements
for the QNL-level quadrature measurements without loss of resolution.
The discussion of linear force detection in this section started with a purely measurement-based, back-action-evading protocol
[Fig. 2(a)] that employed no active squeezing. We can come full circle now by converting the active-squeezing circuit of
Fig. 5(b) to one that uses instead sub-QNL measurements of EPR variables. The squeezing transformation (3.42) absorbs the
two-mode squeezers
√in Fig. 5(b) into the measurements of EPR variables, while changing those measurements to have sub-QNL
resolution σ = er / 2. The resulting measurement-only circuit is depicted in Fig. 7.
C.

SU(2) vs. SU(1,1)

A more discursive discussion of SU(2) and SU(1,1) devices is perhaps in order.
The key feature of a standard SU(2) interferometer, such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Fig. 1(a), is that it measures
the differential phase shift between the two arms by converting it, at the second beamsplitter, to a differential amplitude change,

14
which can be measured by differenced photodetection. Thinking more generally, however, a small phase shift can be regarded
as a phase-space displacement that is orthogonal to the mean field. There are four possible phase-space displacements within
the arms of the interferometer, those being common-mode amplitude and phase changes and differential amplitude and phase
changes. Why does an SU(2) interferometer detect only one of these, the differential phase change?
The common-mode amplitude and phase changes are equivalent to changing the amplitude and phase of the laser source; they
emerge at the output as common-mode amplitude and phase changes. Differenced photodetection is insensitive to these changes,
and this insensitivity, which extends to insensitivity to common-mode noise, is part of the point of standard interferometry. In
principle, these common-mode changes could be measured, but if one has the capability to measure them at the output, one can
omit the second beamsplitter and measure them within the two arms or, better yet, omit the entire interferometer and measure
amplitude and phase signals directly on the input laser light.
Differential displacements in amplitude and phase within the arms are equivalent to signal coming from the dark port, thus
explaining very simply why it is the noise from the dark port, masquerading as differential signal within the arms, that is
the fundamental noise in interferometry. The two differential signals exchange roles at the second beamsplitter, the differential
phase changes becoming differential amplitude changes, detectable by differenced photodetection, and the differential amplitude
changes becoming differental phase changes. This is, indeed, as noted above, what an SU(2) interferometer is all about. One
could, in principle, measure the differential phase changes at the output, but the best way to do that would be to omit the second
beamsplitter and to use differenced photodetection to measure those same changes as differential amplitude changes within
the arms.
One is left back at the key feature of standard interferometry, i.e., using interference at the second beamsplitter to turn
differential phase shifts between the two arms into differential amplitude changes, which are measured by differenced squarelaw detection.
The precise SU(1,1) analogue of the Mach-Zehnder SU(2) in Fig. 1(a) is to introduce common-mode phase shifts within the
†
†
arms, i.e., the unitary operator eiK0 ϕ = ei(â â+b̂b̂ )ϕ/2 , and to do summed photodetection on the output modes, i.e., to measure
K0 = â† â + b̂b̂† . A quick calculation shows, however, that with vacuum inputs, this only produces a signal at second order in ϕ.
Far more productive is to follow the course taken in this paper and to consider detection of phase-space displacements. The
general situation is to impose phase-space displacements on both modes, i.e., to consider the displacement operator D(γa ) ⊗
D(γb ), so that the overall unitary for the device is
S2† D(γa ) ⊗ D(γb )S2 .

What one is able to measure with subvacuum resolution are common-mode position-quadrature displacements and differential
momentum-quadrature displacements. This accounts for the perhaps puzzling displacement signal depicted in Fig. 1(b),
D(γ ∗ ) ⊗ D(γ) = eγ

which, since γa = γ ∗ and γb = γ, deposits signal only in the EPR variables that can be detected with enhanced resolution, i.e.,
γa∗ + γb = 2γ and γa − γb∗ = 0.
SU(1,1) devices live on the noiseless linear amplification and de-amplification of squeezers to empower linear measurements
at the vacuum level to achieve subvacuum displacement resolution. This discussion thus supports the renaming of SU(1,1) in-

could substitute heterodyne measurements of the two modes. (b) Circuit equivalent to (a), in which the second two-mode squeezer is omitted

but nobody is likely to have the patience for that.
Let us now turn away from the discussion of persistent modes subjected to itinerant signals to just the opposite, a persistent
signal that is examined repeatedly by itinerant modes.
IV.

SU(1,1) DETECTION OF PERSISTENT SIGNAL USING ITINERANT MODES
A.

Changing perspective

With a persistent signal that can be consulted over and over again by successive itinerant modes, there is no reason to worry
about the post-measurement state of the two modes in an SU(1,1) device. This in mind, the first step is to modify the SU(1,1)
displacement detector depicted in Fig. 5(b) by deleting the quantum wires coming out of the EPR measurement [see Fig. 8(a)];
the only outputs from the measurement are the classical wires that carry the EPR outcomes. This done, one can pull the same trick
as in Fig. 7 by omitting the second two-mode squeezer and replacing it by EPR measurements that have subvacuum resolution
[see Fig. 8(b)]; the deletion of the second two-mode squeezer is called truncating the SU(1,1) device [37, 38, 41]. Up to this
point, the devices under consideration are still aimed at high-resolution measurements in a single shot, but moving forward, one
shifts emphasis. If the objective is to detect and/or characterize a disturbance of mode b over many trials, one doesn’t really need
high-resolution measurements. Instead, what one does is to use the entangled correlations introduced by a two-mode squeezer
to distribute information about a disturbance on mode b over both quadratures of both modes and to measure all four quadrature
components to get as much information about the disturbance as possible. Thus an obvious strategy, illustrated in Fig. 8(c), is to
characterize a disturbance on mode b from the statistics of heterodyne measurements on both modes; this strategy is especially
suitable in the case of weak squeezing, where all four quadrature components carry roughly the same amount of information. A
yet more general strategy, depicted in Fig. 8(d), is to allow any sort of measurement on the two modes, whatever is found to be
best for characterizing the disturbance at hand.
The remainder of this section is devoted to presenting briefly an example where one uses SU(1,1) techniques to detect and
characterize a disturbance. Though the example is drawn from my own work, I emphasize that none of the material is original
to this paper. The example deals with in situ characterization of a passive linear optical network used for randomized boson
sampling and is work done with Saleh Rahimi-Keshari and Sima Baghbanzadeh and reported fully in [46], which the reader
should consult for a complete exposition.

A mathy way of saying this is that SU(2) interferometry relies entirely on SU(2) operations, whereas SU(1,1) displacement detectors are all about the
interaction of squeezing with the linear displacements and linear measurements of the Weyl-Heisenberg group.

FIG. 9: M -mode version of the characterization circuit in Fig. 8(c). Alice has M modes, paired with Bob’s M modes. Each pair of modes is
excited into a two-mode squeezed-vacuum state. Alice’s modes go directly to heterodyne detectors; Bob’s modes transit a passive linear-optical
network (pLON), after which they are directed to heterodyne measurements. As the text discusses, the transfer matrix L of the pLON can be
reconstructed from the statistics of the heterodyne measurements.

B. In situ characterization of linear optical networks in randomized boson sampling

The setting now is the set of M SU(1,1) devices depicted in Fig. 9. The upper M modes belong to Alice and are numbered
from bottom to top; the lower M modes belong to Bob and are numbered from top to bottom. The modes are paired up by
number, and each pair is excited into a two-mode squeezed-vacuum state S2 (r)|0, 0i. The overall state of all the modes is thus

The second line uses the quasi-normal-ordered form of the squeeze operator [58, 59]. Bob’s modes are input to a lossy, passive
linear-optical network (pLON) that is described by an M × M transfer matrix L. The transfer matrix specifies how coherentstate amplitudes are transmitted through the pLON; i.e., a coherent state |β1 , β2 , . . . , βM i = |βi, where β is the M -dimensional
row vector of complex amplitudes, when input to the pLON, becomes the coherent state |βLi at the pLON’s output. The final
step in Fig. 9 is to do heterodyne measurements on all the modes, both at Alice’s end and Bob’s end. The resulting circuit is the
M -mode version of the SU(1,1) device depicted in Fig. 8(c), where the disturbance to be characterized is the pLON.
It is clear from the final form in Eq. (4.1) that the marginal state at Alice’s end and the marginal state input to Bob’s pLON
are identical product thermal states, with the mean number of photons in each mode being sinh2 r. The marginal heterodyne
statistics at Alice’s end are described by an isotropic Gaussian distribution whose quadrature variances are 1 + sinh2 r = cosh2 r.
The strict photon-number correlations between Alice’s modes and Bob’s modes, displayed in the final line of Eq. (4.1), mean
that if Alice were to count nj photons in mode j, nj photons would enter the pLON from the partner mode j at√Bob’s end. The
case of interest to us is when the total mean number of photons in the marginal thermal states is M sinh2 r ' M ; the reason
for this choice is that it is the largest squeezing for which there is a reasonably good chance that a photocounting
Alice would
√
detect only vacuum or single photons, thereby preparing single photons in a random selection of about M modes at the input
to Bob’s pLON. This is very weak squeezing as M gets large.
The point of the circuit in Fig. 9 is to characterize the transfer matrix L. Since the transfer matrix L transforms coherentstate amplitudes through its pLON, one can characterize the pLON by inputting a sufficient variety of coherent states and by
doing heterodyne detection or photocounting at the pLON’s output; procedures for selecting an appropriate set of input coherent

17
states have been shown explicitly by [60]. This can be achieved in the current setting by conditioning the input states to the
pLON on the outcomes of Alice’s heterodyne measurements. Indeed, if Alice’s heterodyne measurements yield outcomes
α1 · · · αM = α, the state input to the pLON, obtained by projecting onto the coherent state |αi,
hα|ΨAB i ∝

is the coherent state |−α∗ tanh ri. The state output from the pLON is the coherent state |−α∗ L tanh ri. Alice’s heterodyne
outcomes are selected from an isotropic Gaussian distribution, so the conditional states input to Bob’s pLON are certainly
sufficient for characterization of L. Even though one is characterizing the pLON using the joint heterodyne statistics of both
Alice and Bob, the emphasis here is on the heterodyne statistics at Bob’s end, conditioned on the heterodyne outcomes at
Alice’s end.
This procedure, though straightforward, is too straightforward. One would like to turn the tables on the characterization, characterizing not using Bob’s statistics conditioned on Alice’s heterodyne outcomes, but rather using Alice’s heterodyne statistics
conditioned on Bob’s outcomes. One can see how this might be done in the following way. Mode i at Bob’s end is in a coherent
state with complex amplitude − tanh r(α∗ L)i . The vector component here is
(α∗ L)i =

M
X

αj∗ Lji = α∗ Li ,

(4.3)

j=1

T
where Li = L1i · · · LM i is the ith column of the transfer matrix. Suppose Bob gets heterodyne outcome 0 for mode i.
Though this doesn’t mean that 0 = α∗ Li , i.e., that αT is orthogonal to Li , it does mean that the statistics of Alice’s heterodyne
outcomes α, conditioned on Bob’s getting heterodyne outcome 0 on mode i, are prejudiced, just a bit for the weak squeezing we
are contemplating, toward having αT orthogonal to Li . More precisely, when conditioned on Bob’s getting heterodyne outcome
0 on mode i, Alice’s heterodyne outcomes are drawn from a Gaussian distribution that is narrower along the direction of the
complex vector Li than in the M complex directions orthogonal to Li . From these conditional heterodyne statistics, specifically,
from the second moments of the heterodyne outcomes, Alice can determine the ith column of the transfer matrix and, hence,
all columns.
There is an immediate problem. Since Bob’s heterodyne outcomes are drawn from a continuous distribution, the outcome
for mode i is never exactly zero. This problem is easily overcome by considering conditioning on all of Bob’s heterodyne
outcomes—it is clear from the discussion above that the joint heterodyne statistics are sufficient to characterize the pLON—but
here we take a different tack: discretize Bob’s outcomes by switching from heterodyne detection to photon counting. Since
getting heterodyne outcome 0 is equivalent to finding a mode in vacuum, all the conclusions about characterizing Li apply to
Alice’s heterodyne statistics conditioned on Bob’s counting no photons in mode i; moreover, for weak squeezing, getting no
counts is the most likely outcome for every mode at the output of the pLON.
These considerations lead to modifying the circuit of Fig. 9 to that in Fig. 10(a), where Alice makes heterodyne measurements
and Bob does photocounting. After each run of the circuit, Bob reports the photocount outcomes to Alice. Alice gathers together
the heterodyne records for which Bob reports no count in mode i, estimates second moments of the modal complex amplitudes
from these records, and then extracts an estimate of the ith column of the transfer matrix. Proceeding in this way through all the
modes at Bob’s end, Alice ends up with an estimate of the entire transfer matrix.
Suppose Alice decides to count photons instead doing heterodyne measurements. The result is the circuit of Fig. 10(b), which
implements the randomized form [47] of boson sampling [61]. When Alice counts a single photon in a mode, the companion
mode at Bob’s end is prepared in a single-photon state to be input to the pLON. For the weak squeezing√we have specified, there
is a good chance that Alice counts only vacuum or a single photon in each mode; in this case, roughly M of Bob’s modes are
illuminated by a single photon, and Bob’s photocounts at the output of the pLON are an instance of the boson-sampling problem,
i.e., are drawn from the photocount distribution for this particular, randomly chosen set of single-photon inputs to the pLON.
The overall picture is now clear. In each run of the experiment, Alice can decide to do heterodyne measurements, as in
Fig. 10(a), or to do photocounting, as in Fig. 10(b); Bob does photon counting in all runs and reports the the photocount
record to Alice. The runs for which Alice does heterodyne measurements are characterization runs: Alice can extract from
the heterodyne statistics of these runs, conditioned on aspects of the photocount record Bob reports, an estimate of the transfer
matrix of Bob’s pLON. The runs for which Alice does photon counting give rise to randomized boson sampling: Alice can
be confident that the photocount record Bob reports is an instance of boson sampling for single photons input to the ports of
Bob’s pLON corresponding to Alice’s photocounts and this for the pLON described by the transfer matrix determined by the
characterization runs. The key point, which leads to calling this in situ characterization, is that Alice can decide which runs
are used for characterization and which for randomized boson sampling without Bob’s knowing and without making changes to
anything at Bob’s end.
The entanglement of the two-mode squeezed-vacuum states empowers the ability to do both characterization runs and bosonsampling runs without changing changing anything about the apparatus at Bob’s end. The characterization circuit in Fig. 10(a) is

FIG. 10: Circuits for in situ characterization of a pLON used for randomized boson sampling. (a) Circuit for characterization runs. Alice
does heterodyne measurements, and Bob counts photons at the output of the pLON. Alice can characterize the transfer matrix of the pLON
from the heterodyne statistics conditioned on aspects of Bob’s photocount record. (b) Circuit for randomized boson sampling. Both Alice and
Bob count photons. Given a photocount record at Alice’s end consisting of vacuum or a single photon in each mode, the input to the pLON
is vacuum or a single photon into Bob’s partner modes. Bob’s photocount record is an instance of the boson-sampling problem with random
single-photon inputs. The entanglement of the two-mode squeezed states is what allows Alice to decide for each run, without Bob’s knowing
and without changing anything at Bob’s end, whether to purpose the run for characterization (by using heterodyne detection) or for boson
sampling (by using photon counting).

a multi-mode version of the general SU(1,1) device of Fig. 8(d), which is aimed at detecting and characterizing a disturbance, in
this case, Bob’s pLON, from the statistics of measurements on all modes. What enables Alice to switch to boson sampling simply
by doing photon counting instead of heterodyne measurements is the modal entanglement of the two-mode squeezed-vacuum
states. The characterization runs rely on the correlation between complex amplitudes at Alice’s end and photon number at Bob’s
end, whereas the boson-sampling runs live off the (strict) correlation between Alice’s photon numbers and Bob’s input photon
numbers. This kind of simultaneous correlation between different physical quantities is the essence of quantum entanglement.
V.

CONCLUSION

What little there is left to say can be said quickly. The resource of SU(1,1)-generated states has played a role in quantum information since before there was a quantum information science. The nearly 40-year-old proposal [5] to use squeezed-vacuum light
to reduce shot noise in interferometers is now topping off the billion-dollar investments in the LIGO and VIRGO gravitationalwave interferometers. Twenty years ago, generating a two-mode squeezed-vacuum state and measuring EPR variables were
the key ingredients in the first demonstration of unconditional quantum teleportation [62]. Today, ideas for modal (continuousvariable) cluster-state computation [63, 64] live on two-mode squeezing; using this resource, experimentalists have demonstrated
entanglement of large numbers of modes in one- and now two-dimensional cluster states [65]. The list goes on, but this paper
does not.
Metrology is where SU(1,1) got its start in quantum information science. In this paper, I have tried to develop a framework,
based on quantum circuits, for thinking about the potential of active squeezing for metrology and other applications by relating
the use of active squeezing to more primitive notions of high-resolution, back-action-evading measurements, by spelling out
connections between different ways of using the resource of active squeezing, and by indicating that exploiting to the full
two-mode squeezing’s quantum entanglement might allow you to do more than you set out to do.
