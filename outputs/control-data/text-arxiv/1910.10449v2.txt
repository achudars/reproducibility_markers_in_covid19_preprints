Abstract: The sea quark contributions to the nucleon electromagnetic form factors from up, down and strange
quarks are studied with the nonlocal chiral effective Lagrangian. Both octet and decuplet intermediate states are
included in the one loop calculation. Compared with the strange form factors, though their signs are the same, the
absolute value of the light quark form factors are much larger. For both electric and magnetic form factors, the
contribution from d quark is larger than that from u quark. The current lattice data for the light-sea quark form
factors are between our sea quark results for u and d.
Key words: electromagnetic form factors, nonlocal Lagrangian, chiral symmetry

Introduction

Nucleon structure is one of the hottest research objects in hadron physics. A lot of experimental and theoretical efforts have been made on this topic. With the
upgrade of the experimental facility, more and more inner information of nucleon can be detected. By increasing the detecting energy, experimentalists can extract
the parton distribution functions (PDFs) from the deep
inelastic scattering as well as the form factors at relatively large momentum transfer from the elastic scattering. In addition to the valence quark, the information
from sea quark contribution to nucleon properties is also
very important both analytically and numerically. It is
crucial for the leading non-analytic behavior of the physical quantities.
Strange quark contribution to the nucleon form factors is of special interest because it is purely form sea
quark. Lots of experiments from different collaborations
in the world have been carried out to measure this quantity as precise as possible [1–4]. There are also many
theoretical discussions on the strange form factors [5–7].
In 2002, we studied the strange form factors with perturbative chiral quark model (PCQM) and it was found the
strange charge form factor is positive, while the strange
magnetic form factor is negative [8]. At that time, the
theoretical predictions were quite different because there

was no precise experimental measurement yet.
Theoretically, it is impossible to study nucleon structure using quantum chromodynamics directly because
of non-perturbative problem. Besides the phenomenological quark models, there are two systematic methods in hadron physics. One is the lattice simulation
and the other is effective field theory or chiral perturbation theory. Traditionally, chiral perturbation theory
with dimensional regularization (DR) is valid only at
low momentum transfer Q2 < 0.1 GeV2 [9]. It can be
applied up to 0.4 GeV2 if vector mesons are included
[10]. For the lattice simulation, many quantities simulated on lattice are at large quark (pion) mass. It is
necessary to extrapolate lattice data to that at physical pion mass. Instead of DR, we applied the effective
field theory with finite-range-regularization (FRR). The
vector meson mass, magnetic moments, magnetic form
factors, strange form factors, charge radii, first moments
of GPDs, nucleon spin, etc can be successfully extrapolated to the physical point [11–20]. The obtained strange
form factors with FRR are also consistent with our previous results on PCQM [12, 15]. Recently, the nucleon
form factors as well as the sea contribution from light and
strange quark were simulated on lattice even at physical
pion mass [21–24]. Therefore it is interesting to compare their result with that calculated in the framework

of effective field theory.
In these years, we proposed a nonlocal chiral effective
Lagrangian which makes it possible to study the hadron
properties at relatively large Q2 [25–30]. The nonlocal
interaction generates both the regulator which makes the
loop integral convergent and the Q2 dependence of form
factors at tree level. The obtained electromagnetic form
factors and strange form factors of nucleon are very close
to the experimental data [28, 29]. In this paper, we will
apply the nonlocal Lagrangian to investigate the light
sea quark contribution to the nucleon form factors. With
the quark flow method same as in Ref. [33], we can get
the sea and valence quark contribution separately. This
method is equivalent to the quenched chiral perturbation theory. In section II, we will introduce the nonlocal
chiral Lagrangian. The sea quark contributions to the
nucleon form factors are derived in section III. Numerical results are shown in section IV and finally, section V
is a short summary.

The anomalous magnetic moments of baryons can also be
expressed in terms of quark magnetic moments µq . For
example, µp = 34 µu − 13 µd , µn = 43 µd − 13 µu , µ∆++ = 3µu .
Using the SU(3) symmetry µu = −2µd = −2µs , µT and
F2T as well as µq can be written in terms of c1 or c2 . For

example, µu = 32 c1 , µT = 4c1 , F2∆ = µ∆++ − 2 = 2c1 − 2.
The gauge invariant non-local Lagrangian can be obtained using the method in [26, 28, 29]. For instance, the

where F (x) is the correlation function. To guarantee
the gauge invariance, the gauge link is introduced in the
above Lagrangian. The regulator can be generated automatically with correlation function.
With the same idea, the nonlocal electromagnetic interaction can also be obtained. For example, the local
interaction between proton and photon is written as

then expressed as
4m2N

4m2N + Q2
(17)
where Q2 = −q 2 is the momentum transfer. From
Eq. (13), two kinds of couplings between hadrons and
one photon can be obtained. One is the normal one expressed as

where F1 (a) and F2 (a) are the correlation functions for

The form factors at tree level which are momentum
dependent can be easily obtained with the Fourier transformation of the correlation function. As in our previous
work [28, 29], the correlation function is chosen so that
the charge and magnetic form factors at tree level have
the same the momentum dependence as nucleon-pion

and wave lines are for the octet baryons, decuplet baryons, pseudo-scalar mesons and photons, respectively. The
rectangle and black dot represent magnetic and additional interacting vertex.

From the Lagrangian, the coupling constants between
baryons and mesons (coefficients) in Fig. 1 can be obtained. For each diagram in Fig. 1, there exist quenched
and disconnected diagrams. In order to obtain the pure
sea quark contribution, we need to get the coefficients
for the disconnected diagrams. The coefficients for the
quenched and disconnected loop diagrams can be got
separately as in Ref. [33] using the quark flows of Fig. 2.
The obtained coefficients are the same as those extracted
within the graded symmetry formalism in quenched chiral perturbation theory [34]. In Fig. 2, we plot the diagram for the π + rainbow diagram using quark flows as an
example to show the method of separating the quenched
and sea quark contribution. The coefficients for the π +
loop diagram in full QCD is (D +F )2 . The coefficient of
Fig. 2b for the sea quark contribution is the same as that
of Fig. 2c for the K + loop. The coefficient for quenched
sector can be obtained by subtracting the coefficient of
sea diagram from the total one. The coefficients of u, d
and s quark for both quenched and sea quark flow diagram are listed in Table. 1. For π 0 case, the first and

where mj is the meson mass for the baryon-meson interaction and it is zero for the hadron-photon interaction.
It was found that when Λ was around 0.90 GeV, the
results are very close to the experimental nucleon form
factors.
In Fig. 3, we plot the sea contribution of u quark with
unity charge to the proton electric form factor. Three
blue lines from up to bottom are for Λ = 1.0, 0.9 and
0.8 GeV, respectively. As a comparison, the central result for the strange quark is also plotted in the figure
with red line. The solid dots with error bars are lattice
data from Ref. [22]. Since we did not include the valence
contribution of u quark in proton, the electric form factor
of u quark is zero when Q2 = 0. It then increases with the
increasing Q2 . When Q2 is larger than about 0.3 GeV2 ,
it deceases with Q2 . From the figure, one can see the
strange form factor can be described very well. The u
quark result is a little smaller than the lattice data. We
should mention that lattice data are for the light quark
and it was assumed that u and d had the same sea contribution. Therefore, lattice data for the light quark can
be approximately treated as an average of the u and d
contribution.

Numerical Results

In the numerical calculations, the parameters are chosen as D = 0.76 and F = 0.50 (gA = D + F = 1.26). The
coupling constant C is chosen to be 1 which is the same
as in Ref. [28, 36]. The off-shell parameter z is chosen to
be z = −1 [37]. The low energy constants c1 and c2 are
determined to be 2.057 and 0.748, which give the experimental moments of µp = 2.793 and µn = −1.913. The

Same as Fig.3 but for magnetic form factor.

The sea contribution to the proton electric form factor from d is plotted in Fig. 4. Similar as in the u quark
case, the electric form factor first increases from 0 and
then decreases with the increasing Q2 . It can be seen
clearly that our calculated sea quark contribution is obviously larger than the lattice data. The larger sea contribution from d quark than that from u quark is due
to the fact that there is no intermediate octet contribution for u quark. The only contribution for u quark is
from the decuplet intermediate states. Similar results
¯ ū asymmetry in proton, where d¯
can be found for the d−
is excess ū [38–41]. Though there is obviously difference
of the sea quark contribution between u and d, both of
them are much larger than that of strange quark contribution. The strange electric form factor is about 5-10
times smaller due to the suppression of the K meson
loop.
The sea contribution to the proton magnetic form
factor from u and d quark with unit charge are plotted in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Again, the calculated strange
magnetic form factor is in good agreement with the lattice data. All the quark magnetic form factors increase
monotonously with the increasing Q2 . For the u quark
contribution, the absolute values are smaller than the
light quark result of lattice simulation, while for the d
quark contribution, the absolute values are larger than
lattice data. The absolute contributions of both u and d
quark are larger than that of strange quark, especially at
small Q2 . At Q2 = 0, the magnetic moments of the sea
quark u and d are −0.11 and −0.39, respectively, while
the strange magnetic moment is about −0.04.

Same as Fig. 4 but for magnetic form factor.

From the above figures, one can see that the sea quark
contributions of u and d quark are quite different. In
both electric and magnetic form factor cases, the absolute value of sea quark contribution of d is much larger
than that of u. This is because for proton, there are
two up quarks and one down quark. The u quark in the
loop diagram can only form a decuplet state and there is
no intermediate octet contribution to the sea quark form
factors of u. We should mention this difference between
light-sea quark form factors is not due to the mass difference of u and d quark. In fact, in our calculation the
masses of π 0 , π + and π − are degenerate. It is straightforward that the sea quark form factor of u (d) in proton
is the same as that of d (u) in neutron if the masses of
proton and neutron are the same. The mass difference
between proton and neutron will lead to a small charge
symmetry violation, i.e. a small difference between Gup
and Gdn (Gdp and Gun ). The large difference between Gup
and Gdp is because of the effect of non-perturbative valence quark environment instead of mass difference between u and d.
If the mass of the three u quark states is taken to
be degenerate with nucleon mass, and η mass taken to
be degenerate with π mass. the sea contribution from u
and d quark in proton will be the same. This is the artifact of the current lattice simulation. Physically, three
u quark can not form a octet baryon and the mass of
η is much heavier than that of π. Therefore, it is very
interesting and challenging to get the flavor asymmetry
from the lattice with the full-QCD simulation.

Summary

In this work, we applied the nonlocal chiral effective
Lagrangian to study the sea quark contribution of light
quark to the proton electromagnetic form factors. Since
the signs of the sea quark form factors are the same for
u, d and s quark, this calculation is helpful to understand the experimental values of strange form factors. It
is also interesting to compare our result with that from

the lattice simulation. In our calculation, the parameter Λ in the regulator is the same as the previous one
which is determined by fitting the nucleon form factors.
The low energy constants c1 and c2 are determined by
the experimental magnetic moments of proton and neutron. Therefore, in calculating the sea quark form factors, there is no free parameters to be adjusted. Our
results show the electric form factor of light sea quark
with unity charge is positive, while the magnetic form

factor is negative. Compared with the strange form factors, the absolute value of the light quark form factors
are much larger. For both electric and magnetic form factors, the contribution from d quark is larger than that
from u quark. The current lattice data for the light-sea
quark form factors are between our results for u and d.
Therefore, it is interesting if this flavor asymmetry can
be obtained from lattice with full-QCD simulation.
