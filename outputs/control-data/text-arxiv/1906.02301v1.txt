We perform micromagnetic simulations to investigate the propagation of spin-wave beams through spin-wave optical
elements. Despite spin-wave propagation in magnetic media being strongly anisotropic, we use axicons to excite spinwave Bessel-Gaussian beams and gradient-index lenses to focus spin waves in analogy to conventional optics with light
in isotropic media. Moreover, we demonstrate spin-wave Fourier optics using gradient-index lenses. These results
contribute to the growing field of spin-wave optics.
Spin waves are eigenmodes of a magnetic solid body –
magnons are their quasiparticles. Spin-wave dispersion relations and the corresponding magnonic refractive indices depend not only on the orientation of the external magnetic field
but also on several other parameters. Hence, spin-wave propagation is very complex and strongly anisotropic in contrast
to light in isotropic media. Recently, spin-wave optics gains
increasing attention as it can be seen as a prerequisite for spinwave based data-processing. In 2016, Gruszecki et al. showed
theoretically how to excite Gaussian spin-wave beams using
narrowed microwave antennas1 . In the same year, Snell’s law
of refraction has been verified experimentally in a magnonic
system2 . Also in 2016, the concept of spin-wave fibers to
guide magnons using the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
has been shown theoretically by Xing et al.3 and Yu et al.4
independently. Moreover, different concepts to focus spin
waves using the modulation of the film thickness5 or heating via a laser spot6 have been introduced. Further spin-wave
optical elements have been developed in the following year
such as Fresnel7 and Luneburg lenses8 . The concept of spinwave beam excitation via narrowed antennas has been demonstrated experimentally by Körner et al. in the same year9 .
In addition to the described concepts, gradients of the magnetic field and the saturation magnetization have the potential to guide spin waves in magnetic media10–13 . Moreover,
magnonic crystals14–16 have the potential to control and manipulate spin-wave propagation via tailored dispersion relations as well.
In this Letter we demonstrate that the powerful concept
of Fourier optics not only holds for out-of-plane magnetized
magnetic films with an in-plane isotropic spin-wave dispersion relation but also for in-plane magnetization and its corresponding anisotropic spin-wave dispersion. In order to obtain a deeper insight we perform micromagnetic simulations.

is the normalized vector of the magnetization M with respect to the saturation magnetization MS . The effective magnetic field ~Beff includes the demagnetizing and exchange field,
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida interaction, cubic and uniaxial anisotropy, thermal fluctuations, and the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction. γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and α describes the Gilbert damping parameter. To achieve spin-wave
propagation over large distances, the sample system of choice
for the simulation of spin-wave optics is a 5 µm thick yttrium
iron garnet (YIG) film. YIG has the smallest known damping
parameter16 (here α = 10−4 ). Depending on the relative orientation of the external magnetic field with respect to the surface of the YIG film and the propagation direction, different
spin-wave modes exist. If the external field is oriented out-ofplane, forward volume magnetostatic spin waves (FVMSWs)
exist. Due to symmetry reasons no in-plane propagation direction is favored18 . Hence, the isofrequency curves are circles
in analogy to the dispersion relation of light in conventional
optics. In contrast, spin-wave propagation in in-plane magnetized samples is non-trivial: For spin-wave propagation parallel to the external field direction the modes are called backward volume magnetostatic spin waves (BVMSWs). In perpendicular direction to the external field magnetostatic surface
spin waves (MSSWs) propagate. The resulting anisotropic
isofrequency curves of BVMSW and MSSW modes are more
complex. In first approximation, they are parabolic with orthogonal symmetry axis (see Refs. 19 and 20).
The scheme of our calculations is shown in Figure 1. The

(a) a spin-wave axicon is formed by a triangular shaped region with
constant temperature, while (b) a GRIN lens contains a temperature
gradient in a rectangular area.

Oersted field of a narrowed microstrip antenna excites spinwave Gaussian beams. To reduce undesired reflections at the
edges of the simulation area we implement a 1 mm wide absorbing boundary in which the damping parameter increases
exponentially to α = 1. The blue marked region contains the
magnonic refractive index profile that modifies the propagation of the spin-wave beam. We approximate the magnonic
refractive index in analogy to optics as follows:

cally shaped lens (a so-called axicon) is commonly used (see
Fig. 2a). Since spin waves propagate in thin films, a corresponding spin-wave axicon is the two-dimensional projection onto the film plane (an isosceles triangle). The incoming
Gaussian beam with a diameter dbeam passes the optical element centered such that the beam is refracted at the backside
in +y and −y direction. The initial beam is divided into two
sub-beams with diameter dsub-beam = dbeam /2. Right next to
the backside of the optical element both sub-beams interfere.
In this area Bessel-Gaussian beams exist in good approximation. The size of the Bessel beam area depends on dbeam , the
magnonic refractive index of the axicon and its surrounding
area, as well as the characteristic angle βaxicon . In Figure 3 the
obtained results of the micromagnetic simulations are shown.
The Bessel beam is non-diffractive28 . Moreover, the beam reconstructs its shape after impinging onto an obstacle. Hence,
Bessel beams are self-healing29 . The beam profile perpendicular to the propagation direction x can be described by a
Gaussian distribution and a Bessel function Ji of the first kind
(i is an integer). The normalized amplitude of the precessing
magnetization’s x component mx can be fitted using the equation

Here, c is the speed of light in vacuum, k the spin-wave
wavenumber, and ω(k) the dispersion relation obtained by
solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (1). The dispersion relation of the respective spin-wave mode depends
on many different parameters12,13,21–25 . Here, we change the
local temperature T and therefore the saturation magnetization MS (T )15 : MS ∝ −T . It is assumed, that the sample is
heated homogeneously across the film thickness. In this case
nmagnon does not depend on the z coordinate and in the simulation only one cell unit is used for this coordinate. In the
following, spin-wave propagation through landscapes of the
magnonic refractive index equivalent to axicons and gradientindex (GRIN) lenses (see Figure 2) is investigated.
SPIN-WAVE AXICONS

Besides the excitation of Gaussian beams, other beams with
a more complex profile can be created such as a BesselGaussian beam26 which is used in photonics e.g. as optical tweezer27 . To realize such a beam in optics, a coni-

In Fig. 3d beam profiles along cross-sections in the y direction
are plotted and compared to the obtained fitting function. The
coefficient of determination R2 is approximately 0.88. Thus,
the observed beam is Bessel like. The parameters of the fitting
procedure are listed in Table I. Further simulations regarding
BVMSW and MSSW modes are provided in the supplementary material (in-plane field µ0 Hext = 180 mT). The results
qualitatively do not differ from Figure 3, although the corresponding dispersion relations are anisotropic.

SPIN-WAVE GRIN LENSES

By continuously modifying the materials’s parameters, and
consequently the magnonic refractive index, the spin-wave
propagation can be controlled further. In photonics, such
continuous modifications are used in gradient-index optics30 .
Typical examples are the Fata Morgana, GRIN fibers, and
GRIN lenses. A GRIN lens is shown schematically in Fig. 2b.
The rays are curved parabolically since the GRIN lens has a

The working distance for different temperature or magnonic
refractive index differences, respectively, is plotted in Fig. 4b.
Additionally, the orientation of the external magnetic field
is rotated in-plane to investigate the BVMSW and MSSW
modes (see supplementary material, µ0 Hext = 180 mT). In
case of BVMSWs the parabolic temperature profile has
to be inverted, because the dispersion relation ω (k) is
monotonously decreasing with increasing k (in contrast to
FVMSWs and MSSWs, see Ref. 21). Equation (11) can be
verified by fitting the obtained data in Fig. 4b. The corresponding values of R2 are larger than 0.97. By comparing the
maximal amplitude in the focal plane with the value before
passing the lens the amplification factor can be determined.
This is shown in Fig. 4c for the investigated modes and the
corresponding working distances from Fig. 4b. In the simulations, a maximal amplification factor of 3.8 for the amplitude
and of 14.4 for the spin-wave intensity are observed.

SPIN-WAVE FOURIER OPTICS

In Fourier optics the propagation of light is described
using Fourier analysis, and image modifications can be
performed by filtering selected Fourier orders. Just as a lens
with curved surfaces a GRIN lens can perform a Fourier
transformation30,31 . Now we use such GRIN lenses to realize
spin-wave Fourier optics (see Fig. 4d for the corresponding
setup). The far field in the back focal plane of the first lens

is the Fourier transform of the incoming field in the front
focal plane (2 f setup). If the distance between the lenses
equals the sum of the focal lengths, the arrangement is called
a 4 f setup. The object is positioned in the front focal plane
of the first lens (object plane). The Fourier plane is in the
back focal plane of the first lens or the front focal plane of
the second lens, respectively. In the back focal plane of the
second lens the image of the object is reconstructed (image
plane). The magnification depends on the ratio of the lenses’
focal distances fL1 and fL2 . If fL1 = fL2 the object is imaged
without magnification. In Fig. 4d the object is a grating with
7 lines. Each line measures 100 µm × 200 µm and the lines

are separated by 600 µm. The corresponding wavevectors
resulting from the Fourier transformation are visible as
pronounced side maxima in the Fourier plane. The second
GRIN lens reconstructs the grating as seven focal points in the
image plane. The size of and the separation between the spots
is approximately equal to the original grating, demonstrating
a spin-wave hardware Fourier transformation.
Conclusions
By changing the magnonic refractive index via e.g. modifying the local saturation magnetization the propagation of
different spin-wave modes can be controlled. Despite very

Spin-Wave Optical Elements: Towards Spin-Wave Fourier Optics
different and strongly anisotropic propagation characteristics,
we report on axicons to realize Bessel-Gaussian beams as
well as gradient-index lenses to focus spin waves in the
FVMSW, BVMSW, and MSSW geometry. Furthermore, the
properties of the GRIN lenses can be exploited to perform
spin-wave Fourier optics. Since spin waves can be used for
information processing32 , magnonic gradient-index lenses
have the potential to perform a Fourier transform with a
single computational element in real-time.

In the main text, axicons to create Bessel-Gaussian beams are discussed in the FMVSW
geometry. The external magnetic field is aligned out-of-plane and the thickness of the yttrium iron garnet film is 5 µm. Despite the strong anisotropy in in-plane magnetized films
it is also possible to excite such beams in the BVMSW and MSSW geometry. In Figure S1 the corresponding results of micromagnetic simulations are shown. In contrast to
FVMSW modes, the phase fronts of the sub-beams are not perpendicular to the propagation direction. Moreover, gradient-index lenses are also possible in in-plane magnetized
samples (see Figure S2). The obtained results in Figure S1 and Figure S2 qualitatively do
not differ from the FVMSW configuration shown in the main text.
